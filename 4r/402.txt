salsa, music, is, a, style, of, caribbean, music, combining, elements, of, cuban, puerto, rican, and, american, influences, because, most, of, the, basic, musical, components, predate, the, labeling, of, salsa, there, have, been, many, controversies, regarding, its, origin, most, songs, considered, as, salsa, are, primarily, based, on, son, montuno, and, son, cubano, with, elements, of, cha, cha, ch, bolero, rumba, mambo, jazz, r, b, rock, bomba, and, plena, all, of, these, elements, are, adapted, to, fit, the, basic, son, montuno, template, when, performed, within, the, context, of, salsa, originally, the, name, salsa, was, used, to, label, commercially, several, styles, of, hispanic, caribbean, music, but, nowadays, it, is, considered, a, musical, style, on, its, own, and, one, of, the, staples, of, hispanic, american, culture, while, the, term, salsa, today, is, a, rebranding, of, various, latin, musical, styles, the, first, self, identified, salsa, band, is, cheo, marquetti, y, su, conjunto, los, salseros, which, was, formed, in, 1955, the, first, album, to, mention, salsa, on, its, cover, was, titled, salsa, which, was, released, by, la, sonora, habanera, in, 1957, later, on, self, identified, salsa, bands, were, predominantly, assembled, by, puerto, rican, and, cuban, musicians, in, new, york, city, in, the, 1970s, the, music, style, was, based, on, the, late, son, montuno, of, arsenio, rodr, guez, conjunto, chappott, n, and, roberto, faz, these, musicians, included, celia, cruz, willie, col, n, rub, n, blades, johnny, pacheco, machito, and, h, ctor, lavoe, during, the, same, period, a, parallel, modernization, of, cuban, son, was, being, developed, by, los, van, van, irakere, ng, la, banda, charanga, habanera, and, other, artists, in, cuba, under, the, name, of, songo, and, timba, styles, that, at, present, are, also, labelled, as, salsa, though, limited, by, an, embargo, the, continuous, cultural, exchange, between, salsa, related, musicians, inside, and, outside, of, cuba, is, undeniable, the, word, salsa, means, sauce, in, the, spanish, language, the, origin, of, the, connection, of, this, word, to, a, style, of, music, is, disputed, by, various, music, writers, and, historians, the, musicologist, max, salazar, traced, the, origin, of, the, connection, to, 1930, when, ignacio, pi, eiro, composed, the, song, chale, salsita, put, some, sauce, in, it, the, phrase, is, seen, as, a, cry, from, pi, eiro, to, his, band, telling, them, to, increase, the, tempo, to, put, the, dancers, into, high, gear, in, the, mid, 1940s, cuban, cheo, marquetti, emigrated, to, mexico, he, named, his, group, conjunto, los, salseros, with, whom, he, recorded, a, couple, of, albums, for, the, panart, and, egrem, labels, later, on, while, based, in, mexico, city, the, musician, beny, mor, would, shout, salsa, during, a, performance, to, acknowledge, a, musical, moment, s, heat, making, a, connection, with, the, hot, salsa, sauce, made, in, the, country, puerto, rican, music, promoter, izzy, sanabria, claims, he, was, the, first, to, use, the, word, salsa, to, denote, a, music, genre, in, 1973, i, hosted, the, television, show, salsa, which, was, the, first, reference, to, this, particular, music, as, salsa, i, was, using, salsa, but, the, music, wasn, t, defined, by, that, the, music, was, still, defined, as, latin, music, and, that, was, a, very, very, broad, category, because, it, even, includes, mariachi, music, it, includes, everything, so, salsa, defined, this, particular, type, of, music, it, s, a, name, that, everyone, could, pronounce, sanabria, s, latin, new, york, magazine, was, an, english, language, publication, consequently, his, promoted, events, were, covered, in, the, new, york, times, as, well, as, time, and, newsweek, magazines, sanabria, confessed, the, term, salsa, was, not, developed, by, musicians, musicians, were, busy, creating, the, music, but, played, no, role, in, promoting, the, name, salsa, for, this, reason, the, use, of, the, term, salsa, has, been, controversial, among, musicians, some, have, praised, its, unification, element, celia, cruz, said, salsa, is, cuban, music, with, another, name, it, s, mambo, chachach, rumba, son, all, the, cuban, rhythms, under, one, name, willie, col, n, described, salsa, not, as, a, precise, musical, style, but, a, power, to, unite, in, the, broadest, terms, salsa, was, the, force, that, united, diverse, latino, and, other, non, latino, racial, and, ethnic, groups, salsa, is, the, harmonic, sum, of, all, latin, culture, on, the, other, hand, even, some, new, york, based, artists, were, originally, against, the, commercialization, of, music, under, that, name, machito, said, there, s, nothing, new, about, salsa, it, is, just, the, same, old, music, that, was, played, in, cuba, for, over, fifty, years, similarly, tito, puente, stated, the, only, salsa, i, know, is, sold, in, a, bottle, called, ketchup, i, play, cuban, music, cuban, musicologist, mayra, mart, nez, wrote, that, the, term, salsa, obscured, the, cuban, base, the, music, s, history, or, part, of, its, history, in, cuba, and, salsa, was, a, way, to, do, this, so, that, jerry, masucci, fania, and, other, record, companies, like, cbs, could, have, a, hegemony, on, the, music, and, keep, the, cuban, musicians, from, spreading, their, music, abroad, izzy, sanabria, responded, that, mart, nez, was, likely, giving, an, accurate, cuban, viewpoint, but, salsa, was, not, planned, that, way, johnny, pacheco, co, founder, of, fania, records, gave, his, definition, of, the, term, salsa, during, various, interviews, la, salsa, es, y, siempre, ha, sido, la, musica, cubana, salsa, is, and, always, has, been, cuban, music, the, marketing, potential, from, the, name, was, so, big, that, eventually, both, machito, puente, and, even, musicians, in, cuba, embraced, the, term, as, a, financial, necessity, the, instrumentation, in, salsa, bands, is, mostly, based, on, the, son, montuno, ensemble, developed, by, arsenio, rodriguez, who, added, a, horn, section, as, well, as, tumbadoras, congas, to, the, traditional, son, cubano, ensemble, which, typically, contained, bongos, bass, tres, one, trumpet, smaller, hand, held, percussion, instruments, like, claves, g, iro, or, maracas, usually, played, by, the, singers, and, sometimes, a, piano, machito, s, band, was, the, first, to, experiment, with, the, timbales, these, three, drums, bongos, congas, and, timbales, became, the, standard, percussion, instruments, in, most, salsa, bands, and, function, in, similar, ways, to, a, traditional, drum, ensemble, the, timbales, play, the, bell, pattern, the, congas, play, the, supportive, drum, part, and, the, bongos, improvise, simulating, a, lead, drum, the, improvised, variations, of, the, bongos, are, executed, within, the, context, of, a, repetitive, marcha, known, as, the, martillo, hammer, and, do, not, constitute, a, solo, the, bongos, play, primarily, during, the, verses, and, the, piano, solos, when, the, song, transitions, into, the, montuno, section, the, bongo, player, picks, up, a, large, hand, held, cowbell, called, the, bongo, bell, often, the, bongocero, plays, the, bell, more, during, a, piece, than, the, actual, bongos, the, interlocking, counterpoint, of, the, timbale, bell, and, bongo, bell, provides, a, propelling, force, during, the, montuno, the, maracas, and, g, iro, sound, a, steady, flow, of, regular, pulses, subdivisions, and, are, ordinarily, clave, neutral, nonetheless, some, bands, instead, follow, the, charanga, format, which, consists, of, a, string, section, of, violins, viola, and, cello, tumbadoras, congas, timbales, bass, flute, claves, and, g, iro, bongos, are, not, typically, used, in, charanga, bands, t, pica, 73, orquesta, broadway, orquesta, rev, and, orquesta, ritmo, oriental, where, popular, salsa, bands, with, charanga, instrumentation, johnny, pacheco, charlie, palmieri, mongo, santamar, a, and, ray, barretto, also, experimented, with, this, format, throughout, its, 50, years, of, life, los, van, van, have, always, experimented, with, both, types, of, ensembles, the, first, 15, years, the, band, was, a, pure, charanga, but, later, a, trombone, section, was, added, nowadays, the, band, could, be, considered, a, hybrid, salsa, music, typically, ranges, from, 160, bpm, beats, per, minute, and, 220, bpm, which, is, suitable, for, salsa, dancing, the, key, instrument, that, provides, the, core, groove, of, a, salsa, song, is, the, clave, it, is, often, played, with, two, wooden, sticks, called, clave, that, are, hit, together, every, instrument, in, a, salsa, band, is, either, playing, with, the, clave, generally, congas, timbales, piano, tres, guitar, bongos, claves, instrument, strings, or, playing, independent, of, the, clave, rhythm, generally, bass, maracas, g, iro, cowbell, melodic, components, of, the, music, and, dancers, can, choose, to, be, in, clave, or, out, of, clave, at, any, point, for, salsa, there, are, four, types, of, clave, rhythms, the, 3, 2, and, 2, 3, son, claves, being, the, most, important, and, the, 3, 2, and, 2, 3, rumba, claves, most, salsa, music, is, played, with, one, of, the, son, claves, though, a, rumba, clave, is, occasionally, used, especially, during, rumba, sections, of, some, songs, as, an, example, of, how, a, clave, fits, within, the, 8, beats, of, a, salsa, dance, the, beats, of, the, 2, 3, son, clave, are, played, on, the, counts, of, 2, 3, 5, the, and, of, 6, and, 8, there, are, other, common, rhythms, found, in, salsa, music, the, chord, beat, the, tumbao, and, the, montuno, rhythm, the, chord, beat, often, played, on, cowbell, emphasizes, the, odd, numbered, counts, of, salsa, 1, 3, 5, and, 7, while, the, tumbao, rhythm, often, played, on, congas, emphasizes, the, off, beats, of, the, music, 2, 4, 6, and, 8, some, dancers, like, to, use, the, strong, sound, of, the, cowbell, to, stay, on, the, salsa, rhythm, alternatively, others, use, the, conga, rhythm, to, create, a, jazzier, feel, to, their, dance, since, strong, off, beats, are, a, jazz, element, tumbao, is, the, name, of, the, rhythm, that, is, typically, played, with, the, conga, drums, its, most, basic, pattern, is, played, on, the, beats, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and, 8, tumbao, rhythm, is, helpful, for, learning, to, dance, contra, tiempo, on2, the, beats, 2, and, 6, are, emphasized, when, dancing, on2, and, the, tumbao, rhythm, heavily, emphasizes, those, beats, as, well, the, montuno, rhythm, is, a, rhythm, that, is, often, played, with, a, piano, the, montuno, rhythm, loops, over, the, 8, counts, and, is, useful, for, finding, the, direction, of, the, music, by, listening, to, the, same, rhythm, that, loops, back, to, the, beginning, after, eight, counts, one, can, recognize, which, count, is, the, first, beat, of, the, music, most, salsa, compositions, follow, the, basic, son, montuno, model, based, on, the, afro, cuban, clave, rhythm, and, composed, of, a, verse, section, followed, by, a, coro, preg, n, call, and, response, chorus, section, known, as, the, montuno, the, verse, section, can, be, short, or, expanded, to, feature, the, lead, vocalist, and, or, carefully, crafted, melodies, with, clever, rhythmic, devices, once, the, montuno, section, begins, it, usually, continues, until, the, end, of, the, song, the, tempo, may, gradually, increase, during, the, montuno, in, order, to, build, excitement, the, montuno, section, can, be, divided, into, various, sub, sections, sometimes, referred, to, as, mambo, diablo, mo, a, and, especial, many, musicologists, find, many, of, the, components, of, salsa, music, in, the, son, montuno, of, several, artists, of, the, 30s, and, 40s, like, arsenio, rodr, guez, conjunto, chappott, n, arsenio, s, former, band, now, led, by, f, lix, chappott, n, and, featuring, luis, lil, mart, nez, gri, n, and, roberto, faz, salsa, musician, eddie, palmieri, once, said, when, you, talk, about, our, music, you, talk, about, before, or, after, arsenio, lil, mart, nez, was, my, mentor, several, songs, of, arsenio, s, band, like, fuego, en, el, 23, el, divorcio, hacheros, pa, un, palo, bruca, manigu, no, me, llores, and, el, reloj, de, pastora, were, later, covered, by, many, salsa, bands, like, sonora, ponce, a, and, johnny, pacheco, on, the, other, hand, a, different, style, mambo, was, developed, by, cachao, beny, mor, and, d, maso, p, rez, prado, mor, and, p, rez, prado, moved, to, mexico, city, where, the, music, was, played, by, mexican, big, band, wind, orchestras, during, the, 1950s, new, york, became, a, hotspot, of, mambo, with, musicians, like, the, aforementioned, p, rez, prado, luciano, chano, pozo, mongo, santamar, a, machito, and, tito, puente, the, highly, popular, palladium, ballroom, was, the, epicenter, of, mambo, in, new, york, ethnomusicologist, ed, morales, notes, that, the, interaction, of, afro, cuban, and, jazz, music, in, new, york, was, crucial, to, the, innovation, of, both, forms, of, music, musicians, who, would, become, great, innovators, of, mambo, like, mario, bauz, and, chano, pozo, began, their, careers, in, new, york, working, in, close, conjunction, with, some, of, the, biggest, names, in, jazz, like, cab, calloway, ella, fitzgerald, and, dizzy, gillespie, among, others, morales, noted, that, the, interconnection, between, north, american, jazz, and, afro, cuban, music, was, taken, for, granted, and, the, stage, was, set, for, the, emergence, of, mambo, music, in, new, york, where, music, fans, were, becoming, accustomed, to, innovation, he, later, notes, that, mambo, helped, pave, the, way, for, the, widespread, acceptance, of, salsa, years, later, another, popular, style, was, cha, cha, cha, which, originated, in, the, charanga, bands, in, cuba, by, the, early, 1960s, there, were, several, charanga, bands, in, new, york, led, by, musicians, like, johnny, pacheco, charlie, palmieri, mongo, santamar, a, and, ray, barretto, who, would, later, become, salsa, stars, in, 1952, arsenio, rodr, guez, moved, for, a, short, period, to, new, york, city, taking, with, him, his, modern, son, montuno, during, that, period, his, success, was, limited, nyc, was, more, interested, in, mambo, but, his, guajeos, who, influenced, the, musicians, he, shared, the, stage, with, such, as, chano, pozo, machito, and, mario, bauz, together, with, the, piano, tumbaos, of, lil, mart, nez, the, trumpet, of, f, lix, chappott, n, and, the, rhythmic, lead, vocals, of, roberto, faz, would, become, very, relevant, in, the, region, a, decade, later, in, 1966, the, palladium, closed, because, it, lost, its, liquor, license, the, mambo, faded, away, as, new, hybrid, styles, such, as, boogaloo, the, jala, jala, and, the, shing, a, ling, had, brief, but, important, success, elements, of, boogaloo, can, be, heard, in, some, songs, of, tito, puente, eddie, palmieri, machito, and, even, arsenio, rodr, guez, nonetheless, puente, later, recounted, it, stunk, i, recorded, it, to, keep, up, with, the, times, popular, boogaloo, songs, include, bang, bang, by, the, joe, cuba, sextet, and, i, like, it, like, that, by, pete, rodr, guez, and, his, orchestra, during, the, late, 1960s, the, dominican, musician, johnny, pacheco, and, italian, american, businessman, jerry, masucci, founded, the, recording, company, fania, records, they, introduced, many, of, the, artists, that, would, later, be, identified, with, the, salsa, movement, including, willie, col, n, celia, cruz, larry, harlow, ray, barretto, h, ctor, lavoe, and, ismael, miranda, fania, s, first, record, album, was, ca, onazo, recorded, and, released, in, 1964, it, was, panned, by, music, critics, as, 10, of, the, 11, songs, were, covers, of, previously, recorded, tunes, by, such, cuban, artists, as, sonora, matancera, chappott, n, y, sus, estrellas, and, conjunto, estrellas, de, chocolate, pacheco, put, together, a, team, that, included, percussionist, louie, ram, rez, bassist, bobby, valent, n, and, arranger, larry, harlow, to, form, the, fania, all, stars, in, 1968, meanwhile, the, puerto, rican, band, la, sonora, ponce, a, recorded, two, albums, named, after, songs, of, arsenio, rodriguez, hachero, pa, un, palo, and, fuego, en, el, 23, the, 1970s, was, witness, to, two, parallel, modernizations, of, the, cuban, son, in, havana, and, in, new, york, during, this, period, the, term, salsa, was, introduced, in, new, york, and, songo, was, developed, in, havana, the, band, los, van, van, led, by, the, bassist, juan, formell, started, developing, songo, in, the, late, 1960s, songo, incorporated, rhythmic, elements, from, folkloric, rumba, as, well, as, funk, and, rock, to, the, traditional, son, with, the, arrival, of, the, drummer, changuito, several, new, rhythms, were, introduced, and, the, style, had, a, more, significant, departure, from, the, son, montuno, mambo, based, structure, songo, integrated, several, elements, of, north, american, styles, like, jazz, rock, and, funk, in, many, different, ways, than, mainstream, salsa, whereas, salsa, would, superimpose, elements, of, another, genre, in, the, bridge, of, a, song, the, songo, was, considered, a, rhythmic, and, harmonic, hybrid, particularly, regarding, funk, and, clave, based, cuban, elements, the, music, analyst, kevin, moore, stated, the, harmonies, never, before, heard, in, cuban, music, were, clearly, borrowed, from, north, american, pop, shattered, the, formulaic, limitations, on, harmony, to, which, cuban, popular, music, had, faithfully, adhered, for, so, long, during, the, same, period, cuban, super, group, irakere, fused, bebop, and, funk, with, bat, drums, and, other, afro, cuban, folkloric, elements, orquesta, ritmo, oriental, created, a, new, highly, syncopated, rumba, influenced, son, in, the, charanga, ensemble, and, elio, rev, developed, chang, on, the, other, hand, new, york, saw, in, the, 1970s, the, first, use, of, the, term, salsa, to, commercialize, several, styles, of, latin, dance, music, however, several, musicians, believe, that, salsa, took, on, a, life, of, its, own, organically, evolving, into, an, authentic, pan, latin, american, cultural, identity, music, professor, and, salsa, trombonist, christopher, washburne, wrote, this, pan, latino, association, of, salsa, stems, from, what, f, lix, padilla, labels, a, latinizing, process, that, occurred, in, the, 1960s, and, was, consciously, marketed, by, fania, records, to, fania, the, latinizing, of, salsa, came, to, mean, homogenizing, the, product, presenting, an, all, embracing, puerto, rican, pan, american, or, latino, sound, with, which, the, people, from, all, of, latin, america, and, spanish, speaking, communities, in, the, united, states, could, identify, and, purchase, motivated, primarily, by, economic, factors, fania, s, push, for, countries, throughout, latin, america, to, embrace, salsa, did, result, in, an, expanded, market, but, in, addition, throughout, the, 1970s, salsa, groups, from, colombia, the, dominican, republic, and, venezuela, among, other, latin, american, nations, emerged, composing, and, performing, music, that, related, to, their, own, specific, cultural, experiences, and, affiliations, which, posited, salsa, as, a, cultural, identity, marker, for, those, nations, as, well, in, 1971, the, fania, all, stars, sold, out, yankee, stadium, by, the, early, 1970s, the, music, s, center, moved, to, manhattan, and, the, cheetah, where, promoter, ralph, mercado, introduced, many, future, puerto, rican, salsa, stars, to, an, ever, growing, and, diverse, crowd, of, latino, audiences, the, 1970s, also, brought, new, semi, known, salsa, bands, from, new, york, city, bands, such, as, ngel, canales, andy, harlow, chino, rodr, guez, y, su, consagracion, chino, rodr, guez, was, one, of, the, first, chinese, puerto, rican, artists, that, caught, the, eye, of, fania, record, s, owner, jerry, masucci, and, later, became, the, booking, agent, for, many, of, the, fania, artists, wayne, gorbea, ernie, agusto, y, la, conspiraci, n, orchestra, ray, jay, orchestra, fuego, and, orchestra, cimarron, among, other, bands, that, were, performing, in, the, salsa, market, on, the, east, coast, celia, cruz, who, had, had, a, successful, career, in, cuba, with, sonora, matancera, was, able, to, transition, into, the, salsa, movement, eventually, becoming, known, as, the, queen, of, salsa, larry, harlow, stretched, out, from, the, typical, salsa, record, formula, with, his, opera, hommy, 1973, inspired, by, the, who, s, tommy, album, and, also, released, his, critically, acclaimed, la, raza, latina, a, salsa, suite, in, 1975, roger, dawson, created, the, sunday, salsa, show, over, wrvr, fm, which, became, one, of, the, highest, rated, radio, shows, in, the, new, york, market, with, a, reported, audience, of, over, a, quarter, of, a, million, listeners, every, sunday, per, arbitron, radio, ratings, ironically, although, new, york, s, hispanic, population, at, that, time, was, over, two, million, there, had, been, no, commercial, hispanic, fm, given, his, jazz, and, salsa, conga, playing, experience, and, knowledge, working, as, a, sideman, with, such, bands, as, salsa, s, frankie, dante, s, orquesta, flamboy, n, and, jazz, saxophonist, archie, shepp, dawson, also, created, the, long, running, salsa, meets, jazz, weekly, concert, series, at, the, village, gate, jazz, club, where, jazz, musicians, would, sit, in, with, an, established, salsa, band, for, example, dexter, gordon, jamming, with, the, machito, band, dawson, helped, to, broaden, new, york, s, salsa, audience, and, introduced, new, artists, such, as, the, bilingual, ngel, canales, who, were, not, given, play, on, the, hispanic, am, stations, of, that, time, his, show, won, several, awards, from, the, readers, of, latin, new, york, magazine, izzy, sanabria, s, salsa, magazine, at, that, time, and, ran, until, late, 1980, when, viacom, changed, the, format, of, wrvr, to, country, music, despite, an, openness, to, experimentation, and, a, willingness, to, absorb, non, cuban, influences, such, as, jazz, rock, bomba, and, plena, and, already, existing, mambo, jazz, the, percentage, of, salsa, compositions, based, in, non, cuban, genres, during, this, period, in, new, york, is, quite, low, and, contrary, to, songo, salsa, remained, consistently, wedded, to, older, cuban, templates, some, believe, the, pan, latin, americanism, of, salsa, was, found, in, its, cultural, milieu, more, than, its, musical, structure, an, exception, of, this, is, probably, found, in, the, work, of, eddie, palmieri, and, manny, oquendo, who, were, considered, more, adventurous, than, the, highly, produced, fania, records, artists, the, two, bands, incorporated, less, superficially, jazz, elements, as, well, as, the, contemporary, mozambique, music, they, were, known, for, its, virtuous, trombone, soloists, like, barry, rogers, and, other, anglo, jazz, musicians, who, had, mastered, the, style, andy, gonz, lez, a, bass, player, who, performed, with, palmieri, and, oquendo, recounts, we, were, into, improvising, doing, that, thing, miles, davis, was, doing, playing, themes, and, just, improvising, on, the, themes, of, songs, and, we, never, stopped, playing, through, the, whole, set, andy, and, his, brother, jerry, gonz, lez, started, showing, up, in, the, downbeat, reader, s, poll, and, caught, the, attention, of, jazz, critics, during, the, 1980s, several, latin, american, countries, such, as, colombia, venezuela, peru, mexico, and, panama, began, producing, their, own, salsa, music, two, of, the, biggest, stars, from, this, period, are, oscar, d, le, n, from, venezuela, and, joe, arroyo, from, colombia, other, popular, acts, are, fruko, y, sus, tesos, grupo, niche, and, rub, n, blades, now, as, a, soloist, during, this, period, cuba, received, international, salsa, musicians, for, the, first, time, venezuelan, salsa, star, oscar, d,

throughout, the, mid, 80s, and, has, been, quoted, extensively, in, the, gu, as, and, coros, of, everyone, from, van, van, s, mayito, rivera, who, quotes, pl, stico, in, his, gu, as, on, the, 1997, classic, ll, vala, a, tu, vacil, n, to, el, m, dico, de, la, salsa, quoting, another, major, hook, from, pl, stico, se, ven, en, la, cara, se, ven, en, la, cara, nunca, en, el, coraz, n, in, his, final, masterpiece, before, leaving, cuba, di, s, sabe, prior, to, d, le, n, s, performance, many, cuban, musicians, rejected, the, salsa, movement, considering, it, a, bad, imitation, of, cuban, music, some, people, say, that, d, le, n, s, performance, gave, momentum, to, a, salsa, craze, that, brought, back, some, of, the, older, templates, and, motivated, the, development, of, timba, before, the, birth, of, timba, cuban, dance, music, lived, a, period, of, high, experimentation, among, several, bands, like, the, charangas, los, van, van, orquesta, ritmo, oriental, and, orquesta, rev, the, conjuntos, adalberto, alvarez, y, son, 14, conjunto, rumbavana, and, orquesta, maravillas, de, florida, and, the, jazz, band, irakere, timba, was, created, by, musicians, of, irakere, who, later, formed, ng, la, banda, under, the, direction, of, jose, luis, el, tosco, cortez, many, timba, songs, are, more, related, to, main, stream, salsa, than, its, cuban, predecessors, earlier, in, the, decade, for, example, the, song, la, expresiva, of, ng, la, banda, uses, typical, salsa, timba, bongo, bell, combinations, the, tumbadoras, congas, play, elaborate, variations, on, the, son, montuno, based, tumbao, rather, than, in, the, songo, style, for, this, reason, some, cuban, musicians, of, this, period, like, manolito, y, su, trabuco, orquesta, sublime, and, irakere, referred, to, this, late, 80s, sound, as, salsa, cubana, a, term, which, for, the, first, time, included, cuban, music, as, a, part, of, salsa, movement, in, the, mid, 1990s, california, based, bemb, records, released, cds, by, several, cuban, bands, as, part, of, their, salsa, cubana, series, nonetheless, this, style, included, several, innovations, the, bass, tumbaos, were, busier, and, more, complex, than, tumbaos, typically, heard, in, ny, salsa, some, guajeos, were, inspired, by, the, harmonic, displacement, technique, of, the, cuban, jazz, pianist, gonzalo, rubalcaba, curiously, it, was, in, cuba, where, hip, hop, and, salsa, first, began, to, meet, for, example, many, breakdown, sections, in, ng, la, banda, s, album, en, la, calle, are, a, combination, of, guaguanc, and, hip, hop, rhythms, during, this, period, cuban, musicians, had, more, of, an, impact, on, jazz, than, salsa, in, the, united, states, even, though, the, mariel, boatlift, took, hundreds, of, cuban, musicians, to, the, us, many, of, them, were, astonished, to, hear, what, sounded, to, them, like, cuban, music, from, the, 1950s, cuban, conguero, daniel, ponce, summarized, this, sentiment, when, the, cubans, arrived, in, new, york, they, all, said, yuk, this, is, old, music, the, music, and, the, feelings, and, arrangements, changed, nonetheless, there, was, an, awareness, of, the, modern, cuban, styles, in, the, us, tito, puente, recorded, the, irakere, composition, bacalao, con, pan, 1980, and, rub, n, blades, covered, los, van, van, s, muevete, 1985, while, the, puerto, rican, bands, batacumbele, featuring, a, young, giovanni, hidalgo, and, zaperoko, fully, embraced, songo, music, under, the, mentorship, of, changuito, during, the, 80s, other, variants, of, salsa, like, salsa, rom, ntica, and, salsa, er, tica, evolved, with, lyrics, dwelling, on, love, and, romance, salsa, rom, ntica, can, be, traced, back, to, noches, calientes, a, 1984, album, by, singer, jos, alberto, el, canario, with, producer, louie, ram, rez, some, viewed, salsa, rom, ntica, as, a, rhythmically, watered, down, version, of, the, genre, critics, of, salsa, rom, ntica, especially, in, the, late, 80s, and, early, 90s, called, it, a, commercialized, diluted, form, of, latin, pop, in, which, formulaic, sentimental, love, ballads, were, simply, put, to, afro, cuban, rhythms, leaving, no, room, for, classic, salsa, s, brilliant, musical, improvisation, or, for, classic, salsa, lyrics, that, tell, stories, of, daily, life, or, provide, social, and, political, commentary, some, artists, of, these, styles, include, mar, alfann, palmer, hern, ndez, and, jorge, luis, piloto, the, 1990s, was, marked, by, pop, salsa, in, the, us, and, the, timba, explosion, in, cuba, sergio, george, produced, several, albums, that, mixed, salsa, with, contemporary, pop, styles, with, puerto, rican, artists, like, tito, nieves, la, india, and, marc, anthony, george, also, produced, the, japanese, salsa, band, orquesta, de, la, luz, brenda, k, starr, son, by, four, v, ctor, manuelle, and, the, cuban, american, singer, gloria, estefan, enjoyed, crossover, success, within, the, anglo, american, pop, market, with, their, latin, influenced, hits, usually, sung, in, english, more, often, than, not, clave, was, not, a, major, consideration, in, the, composing, or, arranging, of, these, hits, sergio, george, is, up, front, and, unapologetic, about, his, attitude, towards, clave, though, clave, is, considered, it, is, not, always, the, most, important, thing, in, my, music, the, foremost, issue, in, my, mind, is, marketability, if, the, song, hits, that, s, what, matters, when, i, stopped, trying, to, impress, musicians, and, started, getting, in, touch, with, what, the, people, on, the, street, were, listening, to, i, started, writing, hits, some, songs, especially, english, ones, originating, in, the, united, states, are, at, times, impossible, to, place, in, clave, as, washburne, points, out, however, a, lack, of, clave, awareness, does, not, always, get, a, pass, marc, anthony, is, a, product, of, george, s, innovationist, approach, as, a, novice, to, latin, music, he, was, propelled, into, band, leader, position, with, little, knowledge, of, how, the, music, was, structured, one, revealing, moment, came, during, a, performance, in, 1994, just, after, he, had, launched, his, salsa, career, during, a, piano, solo, he, approached, the, timbales, picked, up, a, stick, and, attempted, to, play, clave, on, the, clave, block, along, with, the, band, it, became, apparent, that, he, had, no, idea, where, to, place, the, rhythm, shortly, thereafter, during, a, radio, interview, in, san, juan, puerto, rico, he, exclaimed, that, his, commercial, success, proved, that, you, did, not, need, to, know, about, clave, to, make, it, in, latin, music, this, comment, caused, an, uproar, both, in, puerto, rico, and, new, york, after, receiving, the, bad, press, anthony, refrained, from, discussing, the, subject, in, public, and, he, did, not, attempt, to, play, clave, on, stage, until, he, had, received, some, private, lessons, in, cuba, what, came, to, be, known, as, the, timba, explosion, began, with, the, debut, album, of, la, charanga, habanera, me, sube, la, fiebre, in, 1992, like, ng, la, banda, charanga, habanera, used, several, new, techniques, like, gear, changes, and, song, specific, tumbaos, but, their, musical, style, was, drastically, different, and, it, kept, changing, and, evolving, with, each, album, charanga, habanera, underwent, three, distinct, style, periods, in, the, 90s, represented, by, the, three, albums, manol, n, el, m, dico, de, la, salsa, an, amateur, songwriter, discovered, and, named, by, el, tosco, ng, la, banda, at,

a, strictly, musical, point, of, view, his, charisma, popularity, and, unprecedented, earning, power, had, an, even, more, seismic, impact, causing, a, level, of, excitement, among, musicians, that,

hold, again, fell, out, of, favor, and, was, replaced, with, timba, some, of, the, other, important, timba, bands, include, az, car, negra, manol, n, el, m, dico, de, la, salsa, havana, d, primera,

known, as, colombia, s, capital, of, salsa, in, venezuela, cabijazz, was, playing, a, unique, modern, blend, of, timba, like, salsa, with, a, strong, jazz, influence, during, the, late, 00s, and, the, 10s, some, timba, bands, created, new, hybrids, of, salsa, timba, hip, hop, and, reggaeton, for, example, charanga, habanera, gozando, en, la, habana, and, pupy, y, los, que, son, son, loco, con, una,

views, in, youtube, the, style, known, as, cubaton, that, was, also, popular, during, this, period, was, mostly, based, on, reggaeton, with, only, some, hints, of, salsa, timba, cuban, music, has,

airplay, over, radio, congo, belge, a, powerful, radio, station, based, in, l, opoldville, now, kinshasa, drc, a, proliferation, of, music, clubs, recording, studios, and, concert, appearances, of, cuban, bands, in, l, opoldville, spurred, on, the, cuban, music, trend, during, the, late, 1940s, and, 1950s, congolese, bands, started, doing, cuban, covers, and, singing, the, lyrics, phonetically, soon, they, were, creating, their, own, original, cuban, like, compositions, with, lyrics, sung, in, french, or, lingala, a, lingua, franca, of, the, western, congo, region, the, congolese, called, this, new, music, rumba, although, it, was, really, based, on, the, son, the, africans, adapted, guajeos, to, electric, guitars, and, gave, them, their, own, regional, flavor, the, guitar, based, music, gradually, spread, out, from, the, congo, increasingly, taking, on, local, sensibilities, this, process, eventually, resulted, in, the, establishment, of, several, different, distinct,

tenets, of, western, music, theory, however, as, gerhard, kubik, points, out, performers, of, african, popular, music, do, not, necessarily, perceive, these, progressions, in, the, same, way, the, harmonic, cycle, of, c, f, g, f, prominent, in, congo, zaire, popular, music, simply, cannot, be, defined, as, a, progression, from, tonic, to, subdominant, to, dominant, and, back, to, subdominant,

mid, 1990s, african, artists, have, also, been, very, active, through, the, super, group, africando, where, african, and, new, york, musicians, mix, with, leading, african, singers, such, as, bambino, diabate, ricardo, lemvo, ismael, lo, and, salif, keita, it, is, still, common, today, for, an, african, artist, to, record, a, salsa, tune, and, add, their, own, particular, regional, touch, to, it,

performers, often, incorporate, machoistic, bravado, guaper, a, in, their, lyrics, in, a, manner, reminiscent, of, calypso, and, samba, a, theme, she, ascribes, to, the, performers, humble, backgrounds, and, subsequent, need, to, compensate, for, their, origins, leymarie, claims, that, salsa, is, essentially, virile, an, affirmation, of, the, man, s, pride, and, identity, as, an, extension, of, salsa, s, macho, stance, manly, taunts, and, challenges, desafio, are, also, a, traditional, part, of, salsa, salsa, lyrics, often, quote, from, traditional, cuban, sones, and, rumbas, sometimes, there, are, references, to, afro, cuban, religions, such, as, santeria, even, by, artists, who, are, not, themselves, practitioners, of, the, faith, salsa, lyrics, also, exhibit, puerto,
