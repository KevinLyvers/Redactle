knowledge, that, mina, is, saved, a, note, by, jonathan, harker, seven, years, later, states, that, the, harkers, have, a, son, named, quincey, as, the, acting, manager, of, the, lyceum, theatre, in, london, bram, stoker, was, a, recognisable, figure, he, would, greet, evening, guests, and, served, as, assistant, to, the, stage, actor, henry, irving, in, a, letter, to, walt, whitman, stoker, described, his, own, temperament, as, secretive, to, the, world, but, he, nonetheless, led, a, relatively, public, life, stoker, supplemented, his, income, from, the, theatre, by, writing, romance, and, sensation, novels, and, had, published, 18, books, by, his, death, in, 1912, dracula, was, stoker, s, seventh, published, book, following, the, shoulder, of, shasta, 1895, and, preceding, miss, betty, 1898, hall, caine, a, close, friend, of, stoker, s, wrote, an, obituary, for, him, in, the, daily, telegraph, saying, that, besides, his, biography, on, irving, stoker, wrote, only, to, sell, and, had, no, higher, aims, many, figures, have, been, suggested, as, inspirations, for, count, dracula, but, there, is, no, consensus, in, his, 1962, biography, of, stoker, harry, ludlam, suggested, that, rmin, v, mb, ry, a, professor, at, the, university, of, budapest, supplied, stoker, with, information, about, vlad, dr, culea, commonly, known, as, vlad, the, impaler, professors, raymond, t, mcnally, and, radu, florescu, popularised, the, idea, in, their, 1972, book, in, search, of, dracula, benjamin, h, leblanc, writes, that, there, is, a, reference, within, the, text, to, v, mb, ry, an, arminius, of, buda, pesh, university, who, is, familiar, with, the, historical, vlad, iii, and, is, a, friend, of, abraham, van, helsing, but, an, investigation, by, mcnally, and, florescu, found, nothing, about, vlad, dracula, or, vampires, within, v, mb, ry, s, published, papers, nor, in, stoker, s, notes, about, his, meeting, with, v, mb, ry, academic, and, dracula, scholar, elizabeth, miller, calls, the, link, to, vlad, iii, tenuous, indicating, that, stoker, incorporated, a, large, amount, of, insignificant, detail, from, his, research, and, rhetorically, asking, why, he, would, omit, vlad, iii, s, infamous, cruelty, raymond, mcnally, s, dracula, was, a, woman, 1983, suggests, another, historical, figure, as, an, inspiration, elizabeth, b, thory, mcnally, argues, that, the, imagery, of, dracula, has, analogues, in, b, thory, s, described, crimes, such, as, the, use, of, a, cage, resembling, an, iron, maiden, gothic, critic, and, lecturer, marie, mulvey, roberts, writes, that, vampires, were, traditionally, depicted, as, mouldering, revenants, who, dragged, themselves, around, graveyards, but, like, b, thory, dracula, uses, blood, to, restore, his, youth, recent, scholarship, has, questioned, whether, b, thory, s, crimes, were, exaggerated, by, her, political, opponents, with, others, noting, that, very, little, is, concretely, known, about, her, life, a, book, that, stoker, used, for, research, the, book, of, were, wolves, does, have, some, information, on, b, thory, but, miller, writes, that, he, never, took, notes, on, anything, from, the, short, section, devoted, to, her, in, a, facsimile, edition, of, bram, stoker, s, original, notes, for, the, book, miller, and, her, co, author, robert, eighteen, bisang, say, in, a, footnote, that, there, is, no, evidence, she, inspired, stoker, in, 2000, miller, s, book, length, study, dracula, sense, and, nonsense, was, said, by, academic, noel, chevalier, to, correct, not, only, leading, dracula, scholars, but, non, specialists, and, popular, film, and, television, documentaries, aside, from, the, historical, count, dracula, also, has, literary, progenitors, academic, elizabeth, signorotti, argues, that, dracula, is, a, response, to, the, lesbian, vampire, of, sheridan, le, fanu, s, carmilla, 1872, correcting, its, emphasis, on, female, desire, bram, stoker, s, great, nephew, broadcaster, daniel, farson, wrote, a, biography, of, the, author, in, it, he, doubts, that, stoker, was, aware, of, the, lesbian, elements, of, carmilla, but, nonetheless, notes, that, it, influenced, him, profoundly, farson, writes, that, an, inscription, upon, a, tomb, in, dracula, is, a, direct, allusion, to, carmilla, scholar, alison, milbank, observes, that, as, dracula, can, transform, into, a, dog, carmilla, can, become, a, cat, according, to, author, patrick, mcgrath, traces, of, carmilla, can, be, found, in, the, three, female, vampires, residing, in, dracula, s, castle, a, short, story, written, by, stoker, and, published, after, his, death, dracula, s, guest, has, been, seen, as, evidence, of, carmilla, s, influence, according, to, milbank, the, story, was, a, deleted, first, chapter, from, early, in, the, original, manuscript, and, replicates, carmilla, s, setting, of, styria, instead, of, transylvania, irish, folklore, has, been, suggested, as, a, possible, influence, on, stoker, bob, curran, a, lecturer, in, celtic, history, and, folklore, at, the, university, of, ulster, coleraine, suggests, that, stoker, may, have, drawn, some, inspiration, for, dracula, from, an, irish, vampire, abhartach, prior, to, writing, the, novel, stoker, researched, extensively, assembling, over, 100, pages, of, notes, including, chapter, summaries, and, plot, outlines, the, notes, were, sold, by, bram, stoker, s, widow, florence, in, 1913, to, a, new, york, book, dealer, for, 2, 2, s, equivalent, to, uk, 208, in, 2019, following, that, the, notes, became, the, property, of, charles, scribner, s, sons, and, then, disappeared, until, they, were, bought, by, the, rosenbach, museum, and, library, in, philadelphia, in, 1970, h, p, lovecraft, wrote, that, he, knew, an, old, lady, who, was, approached, to, revise, the, original, manuscript, but, that, stoker, found, her, too, expensive, stoker, s, first, biographer, harry, ludlam, wrote, in, 1962, that, writing, commenced, on, dracula, around, 1895, or, 1896, following, the, rediscovery, of, stoker, s, notes, in, 1972, by, raymond, t, mcnally, and, radu, florescu, the, two, dated, the, writing, of, dracula, to, between, 1895, and, 1897, later, scholarship, has, questioned, these, sets, of, dates, in, the, first, extensive, study, of, the, notes, joseph, s, bierman, writes, that, the, earliest, date, within, them, is, 8, march, 1890, for, an, outline, of, a, chapter, that, differs, from, the, final, version, in, only, a, few, details, according, to, bierman, stoker, always, intended, to, write, an, epistolary, novel, but, originally, set, it, in, styria, instead, of, transylvania, this, iteration, did, not, explicitly, use, the, word, vampire, for, two, summers, stoker, and, his, family, stayed, in, the, kilmarnock, arms, hotel, in, cruden, bay, scotland, while, he, was, actively, writing, dracula, stoker, s, notes, illuminate, much, about, earlier, iterations, of, the, novel, for, instance, they, indicate, that, the, novel, s, vampire, was, intended, to, be, a, count, even, before, he, was, given, the, name, dracula, stoker, likely, found, the, name, dracula, in, whitby, s, public, library, while, holidaying, there, with, his, wife, and, son, in, 1880, on, the, name, stoker, wrote, dracula, means, devil, wallachians, were, accustomed, to, give, it, as, a, surname, to, any, person, who, rendered, himself, conspicuous, by, courage, cruel, actions, or, cunning, stoker, s, initial, plans, for, dracula, markedly, differ, from, the, final, novel, had, stoker, completed, his, original, plans, a, german, professor, called, max, windshoeffel, would, have, confronted, count, wampyr, from, styria, and, one, of, the, crew, of, light, would, have, been, slain, by, a, werewolf, stoker, s, earliest, notes, indicate, that, dracula, might, have, originally, been, intended, to, be, a, detective, story, with, a, detective, called, cotford, and, a, psychical, investigator, called, singleton, dracula, was, published, in, london, in, may, 1897, by, archibald, constable, and, company, it, cost, 6, shillings, and, was, bound, in, yellow, cloth, and, titled, in, red, letters, in, 2002, barbara, belford, a, biographer, wrote, that, the, novel, looked, shabby, perhaps, because, the, title, had, been, changed, at, a, late, stage, although, contracts, were, typically, signed, at, least, 6, months, ahead, of, publication, dracula, s, was, unusually, signed, only, 6, days, prior, to, publication, for, the, first, thousand, sales, of, the, novel, stoker, earned, no, royalties, following, serialisation, by, american, newspapers, doubleday, mcclure, published, an, american, edition, in, 1899, in, the, 1930s, when, universal, studios, purchased, the, rights, to, make, a, film, version, it, was, discovered, that, stoker, had, not, fully, complied, with, us, copyright, law, placing, the, novel, into, the, public, domain, the, novelist, was, required, to, purchase, the, copyright, and, register, two, copies, but, he, registered, only, one, stoker, s, mother, charlotte, stoker, enthused, about, the, novel, to, stoker, predicting, it, would, bring, him, immense, financial, success, she, was, wrong, the, novel, although, reviewed, well, did, not, make, stoker, much, money, and, did, not, cement, his, critical, legacy, until, after, his, death, since, its, publication, dracula, has, never, been, out, of, print, in, 1901, dracula, was, translated, into, icelandic, by, valdimar, smundsson, under, the, title, makt, myrkranna, powers, of, darkness, with, a, preface, written, by, stoker, in, the, preface, stoker, writes, that, the, events, contained, within, the, novel, are, true, and, that, for, obvious, reasons, he, had, changed, the, names, of, places, and, people, although, scholars, had, been, aware, of, the, translation, s, existence, since, the, 1980s, because, of, stoker, s, preface, none, had, thought, to, translate, it, back, into, english, makt, myrkranna, differs, significantly, from, stoker, s, novel, character, names, were, changed, the, length, was, abridged, and, it, was, more, overtly, sexual, than, the, original, dutch, scholar, hans, corneel, de, roos, compared, the, translation, favourably, to, stoker, s, writing, that, where, dracula, meandered, the, translation, was, concise, and, punchy, academic, analyses, of, dracula, as, sexually, charged, have, become, so, frequent, that, a, cottage, industry, has, developed, around, the, topic, sexuality, and, seduction, are, two, of, the, novel, s, most, frequently, discussed, themes, especially, as, it, relates, to, the, corruption, of, english, womanhood, modern, critical, writings, about, vampirism, widely, acknowledge, its, link, to, sex, and, sexuality, bram, stoker, himself, was, possibly, homosexual, talia, schaffer, points, to, intensely, homoerotic, letters, sent, by, him, to, the, american, poet, walt, whitman, stoker, began, writing, the, novel, one, month, following, the, imprisonment, of, his, friend, oscar, wilde, for, homosexuality, the, novel, s, characters, are, often, said, to, represent, transgressive, sexuality, through, the, performance, of, their, genders, the, primary, sexual, threat, posed, by, count, dracula, is, christopher, craft, writes, that, he, will, seduce, penetrate, drain, another, male, with, jonathan, harker, s, excitement, about, being, penetrated, by, three, vampire, women, serving, as, a, mask, and, proxy, for, his, homosexual, desire, his, excitement, also, inverts, standard, victorian, gender, roles, in, succumbing, to, the, vampire, women, harker, assumes, the, traditionally, feminine, role, of, sexual, passivity, while, the, vampire, women, assume, the, masculinised, role, of, acting, sexual, depravity, and, aggression, were, understood, by, the, victorians, as, the, exclusive, domain, of, victorian, men, while, women, were, expected, to, submit, to, their, husband, s, sexual, wishes, harker, s, desire, to, submit, and, the, scene, s, origin, as, a, dream, stoker, had, highlights, the, divide, between, societal, expectations, and, lived, realities, of, men, who, wanted, more, freedom, in, their, sexual, lives, in, the, british, version, of, the, text, harker, hears, the, three, vampire, women, whispering, at, his, door, and, dracula, tells, them, they, can, feed, on, him, tomorrow, night, in, the, american, version, dracula, insinuates, that, he, will, be, feeding, on, harker, that, night, to, night, is, mine, to, morrow, is, yours, nina, auerbach, and, david, j, skal, in, the, norton, critical, edition, of, the, text, posit, that, stoker, thought, the, line, would, render, the, novel, unpublishable, in, 1897, england, and, that, the, america, that, produced, his, hero, walt, whitman, would, have, been, more, tolerant, of, men, feeding, on, men, the, novel, s, depiction, of, women, continues, to, divide, critics, elaine, showalter, writes, that, lucy, westenra, and, mina, harker, represent, different, aspects, of, the, new, woman, according, to, showalter, lucy, represents, the, sexual, daring, of, the, new, woman, evidenced, by, how, she, wonders, why, a, woman, cannot, marry, three, men, if, they, all, desire, her, mina, meanwhile, represents, the, new, woman, s, intellectual, ambitions, citing, her, occupation, as, a, schoolmaster, her, keen, mind, and, her, knowledge, of, shorthand, carol, a, senf, writes, that, stoker, was, ambivalent, about, the, new, woman, phenomenon, of, the, novel, s, five, vampires, four, are, women, and, all, are, aggressive, wildly, erotic, and, driven, only, by, their, thirst, for, blood, mina, harker, meanwhile, serves, as, the, antithesis, of, the, other, female, characters, and, plays, a, singularly, important, role, in, dracula, s, defeat, on, the, other, hand, judith, wasserman, argues, that, the, fight, to, defeat, dracula, is, really, a, battle, for, control, over, women, s, bodies, senf, points, out, that, lucy, s, sexual, awakening, and, her, reversal, of, gender, based, sexual, roles, is, what, abraham, van, helsing, considers, a, threat, dracula, and, specifically, the, count, s, migration, to, victorian, england, is, frequently, read, as, emblematic, of, invasion, literature, and, a, projection, of, fears, about, racial, pollution, a, number, of, scholars, have, indicated, that, dracula, s, version, of, the, vampire, myth, participates, in, antisemitic, stereotyping, jules, zanger, links, the, novel, s, portrayal, of, the, vampire, to, the, immigration, of, eastern, european, jews, to, fin, de, si, cle, england, between, 1881, and, 1900, the, number, of, jews, living, in, england, had, increased, sixfold, because, of, pogroms, and, antisemitic, laws, elsewhere, jack, halberstam, provides, a, list, of, dracula, s, associations, with, antisemitic, conceptions, of, jewish, people, his, appearance, wealth, parasitic, bloodlust, and, lack, of, allegiance, to, one, country, in, terms, of, his, appearance, halberstam, notes, dracula, s, resemblance, to, other, fictional, jews, for, example, his, long, sharp, nails, are, compared, to, those, of, fagin, in, charles, dickens, s, oliver, twist, 1838, and, svengali, of, george, du, maurier, s, trilby, 1895, who, is, depicted, as, animalistic, and, thin, the, novel, s, depiction, of, slovaks, and, romani, people, has, attracted, some, albeit, limited, scholarly, attention, peter, arnds, wrote, that, the, count, s, control, over, the, romani, and, his, abduction, of, young, children, evokes, real, folk, superstitions, about, romani, people, stealing, children, and, that, his, ability, to, transform, into, a, wolf, is, likewise, related, to, xenophobic, beliefs, about, the, romani, as, animalistic, although, vagrants, of, all, kinds, were, associated, with, animals, the, romani, were, victims, of, persecution, in, europe, due, to, a, belief, that, they, enjoyed, unclean, meat, and, lived, among, animals, stoker, s, description, of, the, slovaks, draws, heavily, from, a, travel, memoir, by, a, british, major, unlike, the, major, s, description, harker, s, description, is, overtly, imperialistic, labelling, the, people, as, barbarians, and, their, boats, as, primitive, emphasising, their, perceived, cultural, inferiority, stephen, arata, describes, the, novel, as, a, case, of, reverse, colonisation, that, is, a, fear, of, the, non, white, invading, england, and, weakening, its, racial, purity, arata, describes, the, novel, s, cultural, context, of, mounting, anxiety, in, britain, over, the, decline, of, the, british, empire, the, rise, of, other, world, powers, and, a, growing, domestic, unease, over, the, morality, of, imperial, colonisation, manifesting, also, in, other, works, aside, from, stoker, s, novel, narratives, of, reverse, colonisation, indicate, a, fear, of, the, civilised, world, being, invaded, by, the, primitive, what, dracula, does, to, human, bodies, is, not, horrifying, simply, because, he, kills, them, but, because, he, transforms, them, into, the, racial, other, monika, tomaszewska, associates, dracula, s, status, as, the, racial, other, with, his, characterisation, as, a, degenerate, criminal, she, explains, that, at, the, time, of, the, novel, s, composition, and, publication, the, threatening, degenerate, was, commonly, identified, as, the, racial, other, the, alien, intruder, who, invades, the, country, to, disrupt, the, domestic, order, and, enfeeble, the, host, race, the, novel, s, representation, of, vampirism, has, been, discussed, as, symbolising, victorian, anxieties, about, disease, the, theme, is, discussed, with, far, less, frequency, than, others, because, it, is, discussed, alongside, other, topics, rather, than, as, the, central, object, of, discussion, for, example, some, connect, its, depiction, of, disease, with, race, jack, halberstam, points, to, one, scene, in, which, an, english, worker, says, that, the, repugnant, odour, of, count, dracula, s, london, home, smells, like, jerusalem, making, it, a, jewish, smell, jewish, people, were, frequently, described, in, victorian, literature, as, parasites, halberstam, highlights, one, particular, fear, that, jews, would, spread, diseases, of, the, blood, and, one, journalist, s,

were, typical, of, gothic, villains, during, stoker, s, lifetime, in, particular, his, hooked, nose, pale, complexion, large, moustache, and, thick, eyebrows, were, likely, inspired, by, the,

tragedy, and, terror, if, one, had, no, assurance, to, the, contrary, one, might, well, suppose, that, a, similar, method, and, regimen, had, been, adopted, by, mr, bram, stoker, while, writing, his,

ever, written, the, daily, telegraph, s, reviewer, noted, that, while, earlier, gothic, works, like, the, castle, of, otranto, had, kept, the, supernatural, far, away, from, the, novelists, home, countries, dracula, s, horrors, occurred, both, in, foreign, lands, in, the, far, away, carpathian, mountains, and, at, home, in, whitby, and, hampstead, heath, an, australian, paper, the, advertiser,

san, francisco, wave, called, the, novel, a, literary, failure, they, elaborated, that, coupling, vampires, with, frightening, imagery, such, as, insane, asylums, and, unnatural, appetites, made, the, horror, too, overt, and, that, other, works, in, the, genre, such, as, the, strange, case, of, dr, jekyll, and, mr, hyde, had, more, restraint, modern, critics, frequently, write, that, dracula, had, a, mixed, critical, reception, upon, publication, carol, margaret, davison, for, example, notes, an, uneven, response, from, critics, contemporary, to, stoker, john, edgar, browning, a, scholar,
