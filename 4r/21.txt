the, architecture, of, mesopotamia, is, ancient, architecture, of, the, region, of, the, tigris, euphrates, river, system, also, known, as, mesopotamia, encompassing, several, distinct, cultures, and, spanning, a, period, from, the, 10th, millennium, bc, when, the, first, permanent, structures, were, built, to, the, 6th, century, bc, among, the, mesopotamian, architectural, accomplishments, are, the, development, of, urban, planning, the, courtyard, house, and, ziggurats, scribes, had, the, role, of, architects, in, drafting, and, managing, construction, for, the, government, nobility, or, royalty, the, study, of, ancient, mesopotamian, architecture, is, based, on, available, archaeological, evidence, pictorial, representation, of, buildings, and, texts, on, building, practices, according, to, archibald, sayce, the, primitive, pictographs, of, the, uruk, period, era, suggest, that, stone, was, scarce, but, was, already, cut, into, blocks, and, seals, brick, was, the, ordinary, building, material, and, with, it, cities, forts, temples, and, houses, were, constructed, the, city, was, provided, with, towers, and, stood, on, an, artificial, platform, the, house, also, had, a, tower, like, appearance, it, was, provided, with, a, door, which, turned, on, a, hinge, and, could, be, opened, with, a, sort, of, key, the, city, gate, was, on, a, larger, scale, and, seemed, to, have, been, double, demons, were, feared, who, had, wings, like, a, bird, and, the, foundation, stones, or, rather, bricks, of, a, house, were, consecrated, by, certain, objects, that, were, deposited, under, them, scholarly, literature, usually, concentrates, on, the, architecture, of, temples, palaces, city, walls, and, gates, and, other, monumental, buildings, but, occasionally, one, finds, works, on, residential, architecture, as, well, archaeological, surface, surveys, also, allowed, for, the, study, of, urban, form, in, early, mesopotamian, cities, sumerian, masonry, was, usually, mortarless, although, bitumen, was, sometimes, used, brick, styles, which, varied, greatly, over, time, are, categorized, by, period, the, favoured, design, was, rounded, bricks, which, are, somewhat, unstable, so, mesopotamian, bricklayers, would, lay, a, row, of, bricks, perpendicular, to, the, rest, every, few, rows, the, advantages, of, plano, convex, bricks, were, the, speed, of, manufacture, as, well, as, the, irregular, surface, which, held, the, finishing, plaster, coat, better, than, a, smooth, surface, from, other, brick, types, bricks, were, sun, baked, to, harden, them, these, types, of, bricks, are, much, less, durable, than, oven, baked, ones, so, buildings, eventually, deteriorated, they, were, periodically, destroyed, leveled, and, rebuilt, on, the, same, spot, this, planned, structural, life, cycle, gradually, raised, the, level, of, cities, so, that, they, came, to, be, elevated, above, the, surrounding, plain, the, resulting, mounds, are, known, as, tells, and, are, found, throughout, the, ancient, near, east, civic, buildings, slowed, decay, by, using, cones, of, coloured, stone, terracotta, panels, and, clay, nails, driven, into, the, adobe, brick, to, create, a, protective, sheath, that, decorated, the, fa, ade, specially, prized, were, imported, building, materials, such, as, cedar, from, lebanon, diorite, from, arabia, and, lapis, lazuli, from, india, babylonian, temples, are, massive, structures, of, crude, brick, supported, by, buttresses, the, rain, being, carried, off, by, drains, one, such, drain, at, ur, was, made, of, lead, the, use, of, brick, led, to, the, early, development, of, the, pilaster, and, column, and, of, frescoes, and, enamelled, tiles, the, walls, were, brilliantly, coloured, and, sometimes, plated, with, zinc, or, gold, as, well, as, with, tiles, painted, terracotta, cones, for, torches, were, also, embedded, in, the, plaster, assyria, imitating, babylonian, architecture, also, built, its, palaces, and, temples, of, brick, even, when, stone, was, the, natural, building, material, of, the, country, faithfully, preserving, the, brick, platform, necessary, in, the, marshy, soil, of, babylonia, but, little, needed, in, the, north, as, time, went, on, however, later, assyrian, architects, began, to, shake, themselves, free, of, babylonian, influence, and, to, use, stone, as, well, as, brick, the, walls, of, assyrian, palaces, were, lined, with, sculptured, and, coloured, slabs, of, stone, instead, of, being, painted, as, in, chaldea, three, stages, may, be, traced, in, the, art, of, these, bas, reliefs, it, is, vigorous, but, simple, under, ashurnasirpal, ii, careful, and, realistic, under, sargon, ii, and, refined, but, wanting, in, boldness, under, ashurbanipal, in, babylonia, in, place, of, the, bas, relief, there, is, greater, use, of, three, dimensional, figures, in, the, round, the, earliest, examples, being, the, statues, from, girsu, that, are, realistic, if, somewhat, clumsy, the, paucity, of, stone, in, babylonia, made, every, pebble, precious, and, led, to, a, high, perfection, in, the, art, of, gem, cutting, two, seal, cylinders, from, the, age, of, sargon, of, akkad, are, among, the, best, examples, of, their, kind, one, of, the, first, remarkable, specimens, of, early, metallurgy, to, be, discovered, by, archaeologists, is, the, silver, vase, of, entemena, at, a, later, epoch, great, excellence, was, attained, in, the, manufacture, of, such, jewellery, as, earrings, and, bracelets, of, gold, copper, too, was, worked, with, skill, indeed, it, is, possible, that, babylonia, was, the, original, home, of, copper, working, the, people, were, famous, at, an, early, date, for, their, embroideries, and, rugs, the, forms, of, assyrian, pottery, are, graceful, the, porcelain, like, the, glass, discovered, in, the, palaces, of, nineveh, was, derived, from, egyptian, models, transparent, glass, seems, to, have, been, first, introduced, in, the, reign, of, sargon, stone, clay, and, glass, were, used, to, make, vases, and, vases, of, hard, stone, have, been, dug, up, at, girsu, similar, to, those, of, the, early, dynastic, period, of, egypt, the, sumerians, were, the, first, society, to, conceive, and, construct, the, city, as, a, planned, construct, that, they, were, proud, of, this, achievement, is, attested, to, in, the, epic, of, gilgamesh, which, opens, with, a, description, of, uruk, its, massive, walls, streets, markets, temples, and, gardens, uruk, became, the, template, of, an, urban, culture, which, spread, throughout, western, asia, via, colonization, and, conquest, and, more, generally, as, societies, became, larger, and, more, sophisticated, the, construction, of, cities, was, the, end, product, of, trends, which, began, in, the, neolithic, revolution, the, growth, of, the, city, was, partly, planned, and, partly, organic, planning, is, evident, in, the, walls, high, temple, district, main, canal, with, harbor, and, main, street, the, finer, structure, of, residential, and, commercial, spaces, is, the, reaction, of, economic, forces, to, the, spatial, limits, imposed, by, the, planned, areas, resulting, in, an, irregular, design, with, regular, features, because, the, sumerians, recorded, real, estate, transactions, it, is, possible, to, reconstruct, much, of, the, urban, growth, pattern, density, property, value, and, other, metrics, from, cuneiform, text, source, the, typical, city, divided, space, into, residential, mixed, use, commercial, and, civic, spaces, the, residential, areas, were, grouped, by, profession, at, the, core, of, the, city, was, a, high, temple, complex, always, sited, slightly, off, of, the, geographical, centre, this, high, temple, usually, predated, the, founding, of, the, city, and, was, the, nucleus, around, which, the, urban, form, grew, the, districts, adjacent, to, gates, had, a, special, religious, and, economic, function, the, city, always, included, a, belt, of, irrigated, agricultural, land, including, small, hamlets, a, network, of, roads, and, canals, connected, the, city, to, this, land, the, transportation, network, was, organized, in, three, tiers, wide, processional, streets, akkadian, s, qu, il, ni, u, arri, public, through, streets, akkadian, s, qu, ni, and, private, blind, alleys, akkadian, m, the, public, streets, that, defined, a, block, varied, little, over, time, while, the, blind, alleys, were, much, more, fluid, the, current, estimate, is, 10, of, the, city, area, was, streets, and, 90, buildings, the, canals, however, were, more, important, than, roads, for, good, transportation, the, materials, used, to, build, a, mesopotamian, house, were, similar, but, not, exact, as, those, used, today, reeds, stone, wood, ashlar, mud, brick, mud, plaster, and, wooden, doors, which, were, all, naturally, available, around, the, city, although, wood, was, not, common, in, some, cities, of, sumer, although, most, houses, were, made, of, mudbrick, mudplaster, and, poplar, houses, could, be, tripartite, round, or, rectangular, houses, had, long, roofed, central, hallways, courtyards, and, storeys, most, houses, had, a, square, centre, room, with, other, rooms, attached, to, it, but, a, great, variation, in, the, size, and, materials, used, to, build, the, houses, suggest, they, were, built, by, the, inhabitants, themselves, the, smallest, rooms, may, not, have, coincided, with, the, poorest, people, in, fact, it, could, be, that, the, poorest, people, built, houses, out, of, perishable, materials, such, as, reeds, on, the, outside, of, the, city, but, there, is, very, little, direct, evidence, for, this, houses, could, have, shops, workshops, storage, rooms, and, livestock, in, them, residential, design, was, a, direct, development, from, ubaid, houses, although, sumerian, cylinder, seals, depict, reed, houses, the, courtyard, house, was, the, predominant, typology, which, has, been, used, in, mesopotamia, to, the, present, day, this, house, called, cuneiform, e, sumerian, e, akkadian, b, tu, faced, inward, toward, an, open, courtyard, which, provided, a, cooling, effect, by, creating, convection, currents, this, courtyard, called, tarba, u, akkadian, was, the, primary, organizing, feature, of, the, house, all, the, rooms, opened, into, it, the, external, walls, were, featureless, with, only, a, single, opening, connecting, the, house, to, the, street, movement, between, the, house, and, street, required, a, 90, turn, through, a, small, antechamber, from, the, street, only, the, rear, wall, of, the, antechamber, would, be, visible, through, an, open, door, likewise, there, was, no, view, of, the, street, from, the, courtyard, this, is, because, the, sumerians, had, a, strict, division, of, public, and, private, spaces, the, typical, size, for, a, sumerian, house, was, 90, m, 2, simple, houses, could, be, constructed, out, of, bundles, of, reeds, which, would, be, tied, together, and, then, inserted, into, the, ground, more, complex, houses, were, constructed, on, stone, foundations, with, the, house, being, made, out, of, mudbrick, wood, ashlar, blocks, and, rubble, were, also, popular, materials, used, to, make, houses, the, mudbrick, was, made, from, clay, and, chopped, straw, this, mixture, was, packed, into, molds, and, then, left, in, the, sun, to, dry, they, used, mud, plaster, for, the, walls, and, mud, and, poplar, for, the, roof, in, the, ubaid, period, houses, would, be, fire, clay, pressed, into, the, walls, walls, would, also, have, artwork, painted, on, them, roofs, could, also, be, made, planks, of, palm, tree, wood, which, would, be, covered, in, reeds, the, top, of, the, roof, would, be, connected, to, the, house, through, brick, or, wood, stairs, baked, bricks, were, very, expensive, and, thus, they, were, only, used, to, make, luxurious, buildings, doors, and, door, frames, were, made, from, wood, sometimes, doors, were, made, from, ox, hide, doors, between, houses, were, often, so, low, that, people, needed, to, crouch, to, walk, though, them, houses, would, usually, have, no, windows, if, they, did, it, would, be, made, of, clay, or, wooden, grilles, floors, would, usually, be, made, of, dirt, mesopotamian, houses, would, often, crumble, houses, needed, to, be, repaired, often, in, the, ubaid, period, houses, would, be, tripartite, homes, they, had, a, long, roofed, central, hallway, that, smaller, connected, to, on, either, of, its, sides, it, is, possible, that, the, central, hallway, was, used, for, dining, and, communal, activities, there, was, variety, in, ubaid, houses, some, houses, contained, richer, artifact, assemblage, than, other, houses, ubaid, houses, could, also, be, interconnect, with, other, houses, the, architecture, of, ubaid, houses, is, indistinguishable, from, ubaid, temples, during, the, uruk, period, houses, had, various, shapes, some, houses, were, rectangular, others, were, round, some, houses, in, mesopotamia, had, only, one, room, while, others, had, many, rooms, occasionally, some, of, these, rooms, would, serve, as, basements, in, the, 3000, s, bce, courtyards, were, introduced, to, mesopotamia, courtyards, would, become, the, basis, for, mesopotamian, architecture, these, court, yards, would, be, surrounded, by, thick, walled, halls, these, halls, were, probably, reception, rooms, for, guests, it, is, likely, that, most, houses, had, an, upper, storey, the, upper, storey, might, have, been, used, dining, sleeping, and, entertaining, and, might, have, also, housed, the, bedrooms, people, would, plant, vegetables, or, perform, religious, rituals, on, their, roofs, ground, floors, would, be, used, to, for, shops, workshops, storage, and, livestock, one, room, was, usually, a, sanctuary, in, ancient, sumer, houses, contained, elaborately, decorated, stools, chairs, jars, and, bathtubs, wealthier, citizens, had, toilets, and, proper, drainage, systems, it, is, possible, some, houses, had, altars, in, the, center, of, the, houses, these, altars, could, have, been, dedicated, to, the, gods, but, they, could, have, been, dedicated, to, important, people, the, palace, came, into, existence, during, the, early, dynastic, i, period, from, a, rather, modest, beginning, the, palace, grows, in, size, and, complexity, as, power, is, increasingly, centralized, the, palace, is, called, a, big, house, cuneiform, e, gal, sumerian, e, gal, akkdian, ekallu, where, the, lugal, or, ensi, lived, and, worked, the, palaces, of, the, early, mesopotamian, elites, were, large, scale, complexes, and, were, often, lavishly, decorated, earliest, known, examples, are, from, the, diyala, river, valley, sites, such, as, khafajah, and, tell, asmar, these, third, millennium, bc, palaces, functioned, as, large, scale, socio, economic, institutions, and, therefore, along, with, residential, and, private, functions, they, housed, craftsmen, workshops, food, storehouses, ceremonial, courtyards, and, are, often, associated, with, shrines, for, instance, the, so, called, giparu, sumerian, e, gi, par, ku, at, ur, where, the, moon, god, nanna, s, priestesses, resided, was, a, major, complex, with, multiple, courtyards, a, number, of, sanctuaries, burial, chambers, for, dead, priestesses, and, a, ceremonial, banquet, hall, a, similarly, complex, example, of, a, mesopotamian, palace, was, excavated, at, mari, in, syria, dating, from, the, old, babylonian, period, assyrian, palaces, of, the, iron, age, especially, at, kalhu, nimrud, dur, sharrukin, khorsabad, and, ninuwa, nineveh, have, become, famous, due, to, the, assyrian, palace, reliefs, extensive, pictorial, and, textual, narrative, programs, on, their, walls, all, carved, on, stone, slabs, known, as, orthostats, these, pictorial, programs, incorporated, either, cultic, scenes, or, the, narrative, accounts, of, the, kings, military, and, civic, accomplishments, gates, and, important, passageways, were, flanked, with, massive, stone, sculptures, of, apotropaic, mythological, figures, lamassu, and, winged, genies, the, architectural, arrangement, of, these, iron, age, palaces, were, also, organized, around, large, and, small, courtyards, usually, the, king, s, throne, room, opened, to, a, massive, ceremonial, courtyard, where, important, state, councils, met, and, state, ceremonies, were, performed, massive, amounts, of, ivory, furniture, pieces, were, found, in, some, assyrian, palaces, pointing, to, an, intense, trade, relationship, with, north, syrian, neo, hittite, states, at, the, time, bronze, repousse, bands, decorated, the, wooden, gates, of, major, buildings, but, were, mostly, looted, at, the, fall, of, the, empire, the, balawat, gates, are, the, principal, survivors, temples, often, predated, the, creation, of, the, urban, settlement, and, grew, from, small, one, room, structures, to, elaborate, multiacre, complexes, across, the, 2, 500, years, of, sumerian, history, sumerian, temples, fortifications, and, palaces, made, use, of, more, advanced, materials, and, techniques, such, as, buttresses, recesses, and, half, columns, chronologically, sumerian, temples, evolved, from, earlier, ubaid, temples, as, the, temple, decayed, it, was, ritually, destroyed, and, a, new, temple, built, on, its, foundations, the, successor, temple, was, larger, and, more, articulated, than, its, predecessor, temple, the, evolution, of, the, e, abzu, temple, at, eridu, is, a, frequently, cited, case, study, of, this, process, many, temples, had, inscriptions, engraved, into, them, such, as, the, one, at, tell, uqair, palaces, and, city, walls, came, much, later, after, temples, in, the, early, dynastic, period, the, form, of, a, sumerian, temple, is, manifestation, of, near, eastern, cosmology, which, described, the, world, as, a, disc, of, land, which, was, surrounded, by, a, salt, water, ocean, both, of, which, floated, on, another, sea, of, fresh, water, called, apsu, above, them, was, a, hemispherical, firmament, which, regulated, time, a, world, mountain, formed, an, axis, mundi, that, joined, all, three, layers, the, role, of, the, temple, was, to, act, as, that, axis, mundi, a, meeting, place, between, gods, and, men, the, sacredness, of, high, places, as, a, meeting, point, between, realms, is, a, pre, ubaid, belief, well, attested, in, the, near, east, back, the, neolithic, age, the, plan, of, the, temple, was, rectangular, with, the, corners, pointing, in, cardinal, directions, to, symbolize, the, four, rivers, which, flow, from, the, mountain, to, the, four, world, regions, the, orientation, also, serves, a, more, practical, purpose, of, using, the, temple, roof, as, an, observatory, for, sumerian, timekeeping, the, temple, was, built, on, a, low, terrace, of, rammed, earth, meant, to, represent, the, sacred, mound, of, primordial, land, which, emerged, from, the, water, called, dukug, pure, mound, sumerian, du, ku, cuneiform, during, creation, the, doors, of, the, long, axis, were, the, entry, point, for, the, gods, and, the, doors, of, the, short, axis, the, entry, point, for, men, this, configuration, was, called, the, bent, axis, approach, as, anyone, entering, would, make, a, ninety, degree, turn, to, face, the, cult, statue, at, the, end, of, the, central, hall, the, bent, axis, approach, is, an, innovation, from, the, ubaid, temples, which, had, a, linear, axis, approach, and, is, also, a, feature, of, sumerian, houses, an, offering, table, was, located, in, the, centre, of, the, temple, at, the, intersection, of, the, axes, temples, of, the, uruk, period, divided, the, temple, rectangle, into, tripartite, t, shaped, or, combined, plans, the, tripartite, plan, inherited, from, the, ubaid, had, a, large, central, hall, with, two, smaller, flanking, halls, on, either, side, the, entry, was, along, the, short, axis, and, the, shrine, was, at, the, end, of, the, long, axis, the, t, shaped, plan, also, from, the, ubaid, period, was, identical, to, the, tripartite, plan, except, for, a, hall, at, one, end, of, the, rectangle, perpendicular, to, the, main, hall, temple, c, from, the, eanna, district, of, uruk, is, a, case, study, of, classical, temple, form, there, was, an, explosion, of, diversity, in, temple, design, during, the, following, early, dynastic, period, the, temples, still, retained, features, such, as, cardinal, orientation, rectangular, plans, and, buttresses, now, however, they, took, on, a, variety, new, configurations, including, courtyards, walls, basins, and, barracks, the, sin, temple, in, khafajah, is, typical, of, this, era, as, it, was, designed, around, a, series, of, courtyards, leading, to, a, cella, the, high, temple, was, a, special, type, of, temple, that, was, home, to, the, patron, god, of, the, city, functionally, it, served, as, a, storage, and, distribution, centre, as, well, as, housing, the, priesthood, the, white, temple, of, anu, in, uruk, is, typical, of, a, high, temple, which, was, built, very, high, on, a, platform, of, adobe, brick, in, the, early, dynastic, period, high, temples, began, to, include, a, ziggurat, a, series, of, platforms, creating, a, stepped, pyramid, such, ziggurats, may, have, been, the, inspiration, for, the, biblical, tower, of, babel, ziggurats, were, huge, pyramidal, temple, towers, which, were, first, built, in, sumerian, city, states, and, then, developed, in, babylonia, and, assyrian, cities, as, well, there, are, 32, ziggurats, known, at, or, near, mesopotamia, 28, in, iraq, and, 4, in, iran, notable, ziggurats, include, the, great, ziggurat, of, ur, near, nasiriyah, iraq, the, ziggurat, of, aqar, quf, near, baghdad, iraq, chogha, zanbil, in, kh, zest, n, iran, the, most, recent, to, be, discovered, and, the, sialk, near, kashan, iran, ziggurats, were, built, by, the, sumerians, babylonians, elamites, and, assyrians, as, monuments, to, local, religions, the, earliest, examples, of, the, ziggurat, were, raised, platforms, that, date, from, the, ubaid, period, during, the, fourth, millennium, bc, and, the, latest, date, from, the, 6th, century, bc, the, top, of, the, ziggurat, was, flat, unlike, many, pyramids, the, step, pyramid, style, began, near, the, end, of, the, early, dynastic, period, built, in, receding, tiers, upon, a, rectangular, oval, or, square, platform, the, ziggurat, was, a, pyramidal, structure, sun, baked, bricks, made, up, the, core, of, the, ziggurat, with, facings, of, fired, bricks, on, the, outside, the, facings, were, often, glazed, in, different, colours, and, may, have, had, astrological, significance, kings, sometimes, had, their, names, engraved, on, these, glazed, bricks, the, number, of, tiers, ranged, from, two, to, seven, with, a, shrine, or, temple, at, the, summit, access, to, the, shrine, was, provided, by, a, series, of, ramps, on, one, side, of, the, ziggurat, or, by, a, spiral, ramp, from, base, to, summit, it, has, been, suggested, that, ziggurats, were, built, to, resemble, mountains, but, there, is, little, textual, or, archaeological, evidence, to, support, that, hypothesis, classical, ziggurats, emerged, in, the, neo, sumerian, period, with, articulated, buttresses, vitreous, brick, sheathing, and, entasis, in, the, elevation, the, ziggurat, of, ur, is, the, best, example, of, this, style, another, change, in, temple, design, in, this, period, was, a, straight, as, opposed, to, bent, axis, approach, to, the, temple, ur, nammu, s, ziggurat, at, ur, was, designed, as, a, three, stage, construction, but, today, only, two, of, these, survive, this, entire, mudbrick, core, structure, was, originally, given, a, facing, of, baked, brick, envelope, set, in, bitumen, 2, 5, m, on, the, first, lowest, stage, and, 1, 15, m, on, the, second, each, of, these, baked, bricks, were, stamped, with, the, name, of, the, king, the, sloping, walls, of, the, stages, were, buttressed, the, access, to, the, top, was, by, means, of, a, triple, monumental, staircase, which, all, converges, at, a, portal, that, opened, on, a, landing, between, the, first, and, second, stages, the, height, of, the, first, stage, was, about, 11, m, while, the, second, stage, rose, some, 5, 7, m, usually, a, third, stage, is, reconstructed, by, the, excavator, of, the, ziggurat, leonard, woolley, and, crowned, by, a, temple, at, the, chogha, zanbil, ziggurat, archaeologists, have, found, massive, reed, ropes, that, ran, across, the, core, of, the, ziggurat, structure, and, tied, together, the, mudbrick, mass, the, most, notable, architectural, remains, from, early, mesopotamia, are, the, temple, complexes, at, uruk, from, the, 4th, millennium, bc, temples, and, palaces, from, the, early, dynastic, period, sites, in, the, diyala, river, valley, such, as, khafajah, and, tell, asmar, the, third, dynasty, of, ur, remains, at, nippur, sanctuary, of, enlil, and, ur, sanctuary, of, nanna, middle, bronze, age, remains, at, syrian, turkish, sites, of, ebla, mari, alalakh, aleppo, and, kultepe, late, bronze, age, palaces, at, hattusa, ugarit, ashur, and, nuzi, iron, age, palaces, and, temples, at, assyrian, kalhu, nimrud, khorsabad, nineveh, babylonian, babylon, urartian, tushpa, van, haykaberd, ayanis, armavir, erebuni, bastam, and, neo, hittite, sites, karkamis, tell, halaf, karatepe, houses, are, mostly, known, from, old, babylonian, remains, at, nippur, and, ur,

several, stories, in, height, the, ground, floor, as, usual, having, only, a, door, and, no, windows, all, have, flat, roofs, and, we, gather, from, one, of, the, bas, reliefs, which, represents, a, town, on, fire, that, these, roofs, were, made, just, as, they, now, are, with, thick, layers, of, earth, on, strong, beams, these, roofs, are, well, nigh, fireproof, and, the, flames, are, represented, as, stopped, by, them, and, coming, out, of, the, windows, no, remains, of, a, window, or, so, far, as, we, are, aware, of, an, internal, staircase, have, been, found, of, the,

thick, and, the, evidences, wanting, as, to, finishing, of, these, is, completely, supplied, by, the, sculptures, which, show, an, extraordinary, resemblance, to, medieval, works, of, the, same, class, tier, upon, tier, of, walls, are, represented, enclosing, a, great, tower, or, keep, in, the, centre, the, entrances, are, great, arched, gateways, flanked, by, square, towers, these, and, the, other, towers, have, overhanging, parapets, just, like, the, mediaeval, machicolations, and, are, finished, at, top, with, battlements, remains, of, which, have, been, found, at, nimrud, and, nineveh,
