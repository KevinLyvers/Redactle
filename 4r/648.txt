that, hanna, diyab, should, be, understood, as, the, original, author, of, some, of, the, stories, he, supplied, and, even, that, several, of, diyab, s, stories, including, aladdin, were, partly, inspired, by, diyab, s, own, life, as, there, are, parallels, with, his, autobiography, the, story, is, often, retold, with, variations, the, following, is, a, pr, cis, of, the, burton, translation, of, 1885, aladdin, is, an, impoverished, young, ne, er, do, well, dwelling, in, one, of, the, cities, of, ancient, china, he, is, recruited, by, a, sorcerer, from, the, maghreb, who, passes, himself, off, as, the, brother, of, aladdin, s, late, father, mustapha, the, tailor, convincing, aladdin, and, his, mother, of, his, good, will, by, pretending, to, set, up, the, lad, as, a, wealthy, merchant, the, sorcerer, s, real, motive, is, to, persuade, young, aladdin, to, retrieve, a, wonderful, oil, lamp, chirag, from, a, booby, trapped, magic, cave, after, the, sorcerer, attempts, to, double, cross, him, aladdin, finds, himself, trapped, in, the, cave, aladdin, is, still, wearing, a, magic, ring, the, sorcerer, has, lent, him, when, he, rubs, his, hands, in, despair, he, inadvertently, rubs, the, ring, and, a, genie, appears, and, releases, him, from, the, cave, allowing, him, to, return, to, his, mother, while, in, possession, of, the, lamp, when, his, mother, tries, to, clean, the, lamp, so, they, can, sell, it, to, buy, food, for, their, supper, a, second, far, more, powerful, genie, appears, who, is, bound, to, do, the, bidding, of, the, person, holding, the, lamp, with, the, aid, of, the, genie, of, the, lamp, aladdin, becomes, rich, and, powerful, and, marries, princess, badroulbadour, the, sultan, s, daughter, after, magically, foiling, her, marriage, to, the,

gets, his, hands, on, the, lamp, by, tricking, aladdin, s, wife, who, is, unaware, of, the, lamp, s, importance, by, offering, to, exchange, new, lamps, for, old, he, orders, the, genie, of, the, lamp, to, take, the, palace, along, with, all, its, contents, to, his, home, in, the, maghreb, aladdin, still, has, the, magic, ring, and, is, able, to, summon, the, lesser, genie, the, genie, of, the, ring, is, too, weak, to, directly, undo, any, of, the, magic, of, the, genie, of, the, lamp, but, he, is, able, to, transport, aladdin, to, the, maghreb, where, with, the, help, of, the, woman, s, wiles, of, the, princess, he, recovers, the, lamp, and, slays, the, sorcerer, returning, the, palace, to, its, proper, place, the, sorcerer, s, more, powerful, and, evil, brother, plots, to,

stay, in, her, palace, in, case, of, any, illnesses, aladdin, is, warned, of, this, danger, by, the, genie, of, the, lamp, and, slays, the, impostor, aladdin, eventually, succeeds, to, his, father, in, law, s, throne, the, opening, sentences, of, the, story, in, both, the, galland, and, the, burton, versions, set, it, in, one, of, the, cities, of, china, on, the, other, hand, there, is, practically, nothing, in, the, rest, of, the, story, that, is, inconsistent, with, a, middle, eastern, setting, for, instance, the, ruler, is, referred, to, as, sultan, rather, than, emperor, as, in, some, retellings, and, the, people, in, the, story, are, muslims, and, their, conversation, is, filled, with, muslim, platitudes, a, jewish, merchant, buys, aladdin, s, wares, but, there, is, no, mention, of, buddhists, daoists, or, confucians, notably, ethnic, groups, in, chinese, history, have, long, included, muslim, groups, including, large, populations, of, uyghurs, and, the, hui, people, as, well, as, the, tajiks, whose, origins, go, back, to, silk, road, travelers, islamic, communities, have, been, known, to, exist, in, the, region, since, the, tang, dynasty, which, rose, to, power, simultaneously, with, the, prophet, muhammad, s, career, some, have, suggested, that, the, intended, setting, may, be, turkestan, encompassing, central, asia, and, the, modern, day, chinese, autonomous, region, of, xinjiang, in, western, china, the, arabicized, turkic, kara, khanid, khanate, which, was, located, in, this, region, and, had, a, strong, identification, with, china, bears, a, strong, resemblance, to, the, setting, their, rulers, even, adopting, the, arab, title, of, sultan, even, going, so, far, as, to, adopt, the, title, of, sultan, of, the, east, and, china, which, was, used, alongside, turkic, titles, such, as, khan, title, and, khagan, however, chancellors, were, referred, to, as, hajib, rather, than, vizier, for, all, this, speculation, about, a, real, chinese, setting, depends, on, a, knowledge, of, china, that, the, teller, of, a, folk, tale, as, opposed, to, a, geographic, expert, might, well, not, possess, in, early, arabic, usage, china, is, known, to, have, been, used, in, an, abstract, sense, to, designate, an, exotic, faraway, land, the, story, of, aladdin, is, classified, in, the, aarne, thompson, uther, index, as, tale, type, atu, 561, aladdin, after, the, character, in, the, index, the, aladdin, story, is, situated, next, to, two, similar, tale, types, atu, 560, the, magic, ring, and, atu, 562, the, spirit, in, the, blue, light, all, of, these, stories, deal, with, a, down, on, his, luck, and, impoverished, boy, or, soldier, who, finds, a, magical, item, ring, lamp, tinderbox, that, grants, his, wishes, in, this, regard, german, folklorist, hans, j, rg, uther, in, his, revision, of, the, international, index, published, in, 2004, remarked, that, the, similarities, between, the, three, tale, types, make, it, hard, to, differentiate, them, on, the, other, hand, per, stith, thompson, s, the, folktale, in, type, 561, the, magical, item, is, stolen, but, eventually, recovered, thanks, to, the, use, of, another, magical, object, similarly, czech, scholar, karel, hor, lek, distinguishes, the, three, types, in, that, in, type, 560, the, hero, is, helped, by, animals, the, snake, gives, the, ring, and, the, dog, and, the, cat, retrieve, the, stolen, object, type, 561, does, away, with, the, animals, leaving, the, hero, to, recover, the, stolen, lamp, with, the, second, object, and, finally, type, 562, inserts, another, person, that, helps, the, hero, since, its, appearance, in, the, one, thousand, and, one, nights, the, tale, has, integrated, into, oral, tradition, scholars, ton, deker, and, theo, meder, located, variants, across, europe, and, the, middle, east, in, addition, according, to, scholar, kurt, ranke, in, enzyklop, die, des, m, rchens, the, greatest, distribution, density, occurs, in, europe, and, in, the, mediterranean, region, with, variants, also, collected, in, the, middle, east, turkey, israel, iraq, yemen, iran, central, asia, in, tajikistan, and, uzbekistan, india, among, the, santal, people, and, in, southeast, asia, indonesia, and, the, philippines, adaptations, vary, in, their, faithfulness, to, the, original, story, in, particular, difficulties, with, the, chinese, setting, are, quite, often, resolved, by, giving, the, story, a, more, typical, arabian, nights, background, sega, sammy, have, released, a, line, of, pachinko, machines, based, on, aladdin, since, 1989, sega, sammy, have, sold, over, 570, 000, aladdin, pachinko, machines, in, japan, as, of, 2017, at, an, average, price, of, about, 5, 000, this, is, equivalent, to, approximately, 2, 85,
