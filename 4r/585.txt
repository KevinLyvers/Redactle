graphic, design, is, a, profession, academic, discipline, and, applied, art, whose, activity, consists, in, projecting, visual, communications, intended, to, transmit, specific, messages, to, social, groups, with, specific, objectives, graphic, design, is, an, interdisciplinary, branch, of, design, and, of, the, fine, arts, its, practice, involves, creativity, innovation, and, lateral, thinking, using, manual, or, digital, tools, where, it, is, usual, to, use, text, and, graphics, to, communicate, visually, the, role, of, the, graphic, designer, in, the, communication, process, is, that, of, the, encoder, or, interpreter, of, the, message, they, work, on, the, interpretation, ordering, and, presentation, of, visual, messages, usually, graphic, design, uses, the, aesthetics, of, typography, and, the, compositional, arrangement, of, the, text, ornamentation, and, imagery, to, convey, ideas, feelings, and, attitudes, beyond, what, language, alone, expresses, the, design, work, can, be, based, on, a, customer, s, demand, a, demand, that, ends, up, being, established, linguistically, either, orally, or, in, writing, that, is, that, graphic, design, transforms, a, linguistic, message, into, a, graphic, manifestation, graphic, design, has, as, a, field, of, application, different, areas, of, knowledge, focused, on, any, visual, communication, system, for, example, it, can, be, applied, in, advertising, strategies, or, it, can, also, be, applied, in, the, aviation, world, or, space, exploration, in, this, sense, in, some, countries, graphic, design, is, related, as, only, associated, with, the, production, of, sketches, and, drawings, this, is, incorrect, since, visual, communication, is, a, small, part, of, a, huge, range, of, types, and, classes, where, it, can, be, applied, with, origins, in, antiquity, and, the, middle, ages, graphic, design, as, applied, art, was, initially, linked, to, the, boom, of, the, rise, of, printing, in, europe, in, the, 15th, century, and, the, growth, of, consumer, culture, in, the, industrial, revolution, from, there, it, emerged, as, a, distinct, profession, in, the, west, closely, associated, with, advertising, in, the, 19th, century, and, its, evolution, allowed, its, consolidation, in, the, 20th, century, given, the, rapid, and, massive, growth, in, information, exchange, today, the, demand, for, experienced, designers, is, greater, than, ever, particularly, because, of, the, development, of, new, technologies, and, the, need, to, pay, attention, to, human, factors, beyond, the, competence, of, the, engineers, who, develop, them, william, addison, dwiggins, is, often, credited, with, first, using, the, term, graphic, design, in, a, 1922, article, although, it, appears, in, a, 4, july, 1908, issue, volume, 9, number, 27, of, organized, labor, a, publication, of, the, labor, unions, of, san, francisco, in, an, article, about, technical, education, for, printers, an, enterprising, trades, union, the, admittedly, high, standard, of, intelligence, which, prevails, among, printers, is, an, assurance, that, with, the, elemental, principles, of, design, at, their, finger, ends, many, of, them, will, grow, in, knowledge, and, develop, into, specialists, in, graphic, design, and, decorating, a, decade, later, the, 1917, 1918, course, catalog, of, the, california, school, of, arts, crafts, advertised, a, course, titled, graphic, design, and, lettering, which, replaced, one, called, advanced, design, and, lettering, both, classes, were, taught, by, frederick, meyer, in, both, its, lengthy, history, and, in, the, relatively, recent, explosion, of, visual, communication, in, the, 20th, and, 21st, centuries, the, distinction, between, advertising, art, graphic, design, and, fine, art, has, disappeared, they, share, many, elements, theories, principles, practices, languages, and, sometimes, the, same, benefactor, or, client, in, advertising, the, ultimate, objective, is, the, sale, of, goods, and, services, in, graphic, design, the, essence, is, to, give, order, to, information, form, to, ideas, expression, and, feeling, to, artifacts, that, document, the, human, experience, the, definition, of, the, graphic, designer, profession, is, relatively, recent, concerning, its, preparation, activity, and, objectives, although, there, is, no, consensus, on, an, exact, date, when, graphic, design, emerged, some, date, it, back, to, the, interwar, period, others, understand, that, it, began, to, be, identified, as, such, by, the, late, 19th, century, it, can, be, argued, that, graphic, communications, with, specific, purposes, have, their, origins, in, paleolithic, cave, paintings, and, the, birth, of, written, language, in, the, third, millennium, bce, however, the, differences, in, working, methods, auxiliary, sciences, and, required, training, are, such, that, it, is, not, possible, to, clearly, identify, the, current, graphic, designer, with, prehistoric, man, the, 15th, century, xylographer, or, the, lithographer, of, 1890, the, diversity, of, opinions, stems, from, some, considering, any, graphic, manifestation, as, a, product, of, graphic, design, while, others, only, recognize, those, that, arise, as, a, result, of, the, application, of, an, industrial, production, model, visual, manifestations, that, have, been, projected, to, address, various, needs, productive, symbolic, ergonomic, contextual, among, others, nevertheless, the, evolution, of, graphic, design, as, a, practice, and, profession, has, been, closely, linked, to, technological, innovations, social, needs, and, the, visual, imagination, of, professionals, graphic, design, has, been, practiced, in, various, forms, throughout, history, in, fact, good, examples, of, graphic, design, date, back, to, manuscripts, from, ancient, china, egypt, and, greece, as, printing, and, book, production, developed, in, the, 15th, century, advances, in, graphic, design, continued, over, the, subsequent, centuries, with, composers, or, typographers, often, designing, pages, according, to, established, type, by, the, late, 19th, century, graphic, design, emerged, as, a, distinct, profession, in, the, west, partly, due, to, the, process, of, labor, specialization, that, occurred, there, and, partly, due, to, the, new, technologies, and, business, possibilities, brought, about, by, the, industrial, revolution, new, production, methods, led, to, the, separation, of, the, design, of, a, communication, medium, such, as, a, poster, from, its, actual, production, increasingly, throughout, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, advertising, agencies, book, publishers, and, magazines, hired, art, directors, who, organized, all, visual, elements, of, communication, and, integrated, them, into, a, harmonious, whole, creating, an, expression, appropriate, to, the, content, in, 1922, typographer, william, a, dwiggins, coined, the, term, graphic, design, to, identify, the, emerging, field, throughout, the, 20th, century, the, technology, available, to, designers, continued, to, advance, rapidly, as, did, the, artistic, and, commercial, possibilities, of, design, the, profession, expanded, greatly, and, graphic, designers, created, among, other, things, magazine, pages, book, covers, posters, cd, covers, postage, stamps, packaging, brands, signs, advertisements, kinetic, titles, for, tv, programs, and, movies, and, websites, by, the, early, 21st, century, graphic, design, had, become, a, global, profession, as, advanced, technology, and, industry, spread, worldwide, in, china, during, the, tang, dynasty, 618, 907, wood, blocks, were, cut, to, print, on, textiles, and, later, to, reproduce, buddhist, texts, a, buddhist, scripture, printed, in, 868, is, the, earliest, known, printed, book, beginning, in, the, 11th, century, in, china, longer, scrolls, and, books, were, produced, using, movable, type, printing, making, books, widely, available, during, the, song, dynasty, 960, 1279, in, the, mid, 15th, century, in, mainz, germany, johannes, gutenberg, developed, a, way, to, reproduce, printed, pages, at, a, faster, pace, using, movable, type, made, with, a, new, metal, alloy, that, created, a, revolution, in, the, dissemination, of, information, in, 1849, henry, cole, became, one, of, the, major, forces, in, design, education, in, great, britain, informing, the, government, of, the, importance, of, design, in, his, journal, of, design, and, manufactures, he, organized, the, great, exhibition, as, a, celebration, of, modern, industrial, technology, and, victorian, design, from, 1891, to, 1896, william, morris, kelmscott, press, was, a, leader, in, graphic, design, associated, with, the, arts, and, crafts, movement, creating, hand, made, books, in, medieval, and, renaissance, era, style, in, addition, to, wallpaper, and, textile, designs, morris, work, along, with, the, rest, of, the, private, press, movement, directly, influenced, art, nouveau, will, h, bradley, became, one, of, the, notable, graphic, designers, in, the, late, nineteenth, century, due, to, creating, art, pieces, in, various, art, nouveau, styles, bradley, created, a, number, of, designs, as, promotions, for, a, literary, magazine, titled, the, chap, book, in, 1917, frederick, h, meyer, director, and, instructor, at, the, california, school, of, arts, and, crafts, taught, a, class, entitled, graphic, design, and, lettering, raffe, s, graphic, design, published, in, 1927, was, the, first, book, to, use, graphic, design, in, its, title, in, 1936, author, and, graphic, designer, leon, friend, published, his, book, titled, graphic, design, and, it, is, known, to, be, the, first, piece, of, literature, to, cover, the, topic, extensively, the, signage, in, the, london, underground, is, a, classic, design, example, of, the, modern, era, although, he, lacked, artistic, training, frank, pick, led, the, underground, group, design, and, publicity, movement, the, first, underground, station, signs, were, introduced, in, 1908, with, a, design, of, a, solid, red, disk, with, a, blue, bar, in, the, center, and, the, name, of, the, station, the, station, name, was, in, white, sans, serif, letters, it, was, in, 1916, when, pick, used, the, expertise, of, edward, johnston, to, design, a, new, typeface, for, the, underground, johnston, redesigned, the, underground, sign, and, logo, to, include, his, typeface, on, the, blue, bar, in, the, center, of, a, red, circle, in, the, 1920s, soviet, constructivism, applied, intellectual, production, in, different, spheres, of, production, the, movement, saw, individualistic, art, as, useless, in, revolutionary, russia, and, thus, moved, towards, creating, objects, for, utilitarian, purposes, they, designed, buildings, film, and, theater, sets, posters, fabrics, clothing, furniture, logos, menus, etc, jan, tschichold, codified, the, principles, of, modern, typography, in, his, 1928, book, new, typography, he, later, repudiated, the, philosophy, he, espoused, in, this, book, as, fascistic, but, it, remained, influential, tschichold, bauhaus, typographers, such, as, herbert, bayer, and, l, szl, moholy, nagy, and, el, lissitzky, greatly, influenced, graphic, design, they, pioneered, production, techniques, and, stylistic, devices, used, throughout, the, twentieth, century, the, following, years, saw, graphic, design, in, the, modern, style, gain, widespread, acceptance, and, application, the, professional, graphic, design, industry, grew, in, parallel, with, consumerism, this, raised, concerns, and, criticisms, notably, from, within, the, graphic, design, community, with, the, first, things, first, manifesto, first, launched, by, ken, garland, in, 1964, it, was, re, published, as, the, first, things, first, 2000, manifesto, in, 1999, in, the, magazine, emigre, 51, stating, we, propose, a, reversal, of, priorities, in, favor, of, more, useful, lasting, and, democratic, forms, of, communication, a, mindshift, away, from, product, marketing, and, toward, the, exploration, and, production, of, a, new, kind, of, meaning, the, scope, of, debate, is, shrinking, it, must, expand, consumerism, is, running, uncontested, it, must, be, challenged, by, other, perspectives, expressed, in, part, through, the, visual, languages, and, resources, of, design, graphic, design, can, have, many, applications, from, road, signs, to, technical, schematics, and, reference, manuals, it, is, often, used, in, branding, products, and, elements, of, company, identity, such, as, logos, colors, packaging, labelling, and, text, from, scientific, journals, to, news, reporting, the, presentation, of, opinions, and, facts, is, often, improved, with, graphics, and, thoughtful, compositions, of, visual, information, known, as, information, design, with, the, advent, of, the, web, information, designers, with, experience, in, interactive, tools, are, increasingly, used, to, illustrate, the, background, to, news, stories, information, design, can, include, data, and, information, visualization, which, involves, using, programs, to, interpret, and, form, data, into, a, visually, compelling, presentation, and, can, be, tied, in, with, information, graphics, a, graphic, design, project, may, involve, the, creative, presentation, of, existing, text, ornament, and, images, the, process, school, is, concerned, with, communication, it, highlights, the, channels, and, media, through, which, messages, are, transmitted, and, by, which, senders, and, receivers, encode, and, decode, these, messages, the, semiotic, school, treats, a, message, as, a, construction, of, signs, which, through, interaction, with, receivers, produces, meaning, communication, as, an, agent, typography, includes, type, design, modifying, type, glyphs, and, arranging, type, type, glyphs, characters, are, created, and, modified, using, illustration, techniques, type, arrangement, is, the, selection, of, typefaces, point, size, tracking, the, space, between, all, characters, used, kerning, the, space, between, two, specific, characters, and, leading, line, spacing, typography, is, performed, by, typesetters, compositors, typographers, graphic, artists, art, directors, and, clerical, workers, until, the, digital, age, typography, was, a, specialized, occupation, certain, fonts, communicate, or, resemble, stereotypical, notions, for, example, the, 1942, report, is, a, font, which, types, text, akin, to, a, typewriter, or, a, vintage, report, page, layout, deals, with, the, arrangement, of, elements, content, on, a, page, such, as, image, placement, text, layout, and, style, page, design, has, always, been, a, consideration, in, printed, material, and, more, recently, extended, to, displays, such, as, web, pages, elements, typically, consist, of, type, text, images, pictures, and, with, print, media, occasionally, place, holder, graphics, such, as, a, dieline, for, elements, that, are, not, printed, with, ink, such, as, die, laser, cutting, foil, stamping, or, blind, embossing, a, grid, serves, as, a, method, of, arranging, both, space, and, information, allowing, the, reader, to, easily, comprehend, the, overall, project, furthermore, a, grid, functions, as, a, container, for, information, and, a, means, of, establishing, and, maintaining, order, despite, grids, being, utilized, for, centuries, many, graphic, designers, associate, them, with, swiss, design, the, desire, for, order, in, the, 1940s, resulted, in, a, highly, systematic, approach, to, visualizing, information, however, grids, were, later, regarded, as, tedious, and, uninteresting, earning, the, label, of, designersaur, today, grids, are, once, again, considered, crucial, tools, for, professionals, whether, they, are, novices, or, veterans, in, the, mid, 1980s, desktop, publishing, and, graphic, art, software, applications, introduced, computer, image, manipulation, and, creation, capabilities, that, had, previously, been, manually, executed, computers, enabled, designers, to, instantly, see, the, effects, of, layout, or, typographic, changes, and, to, simulate, the, effects, of, traditional, media, traditional, tools, such, as, pencils, can, be, useful, even, when, computers, are, used, for, finalization, a, designer, or, art, director, may, sketch, numerous, concepts, as, part, of, the, creative, process, styluses, can, be, used, with, tablet, computers, to, capture, hand, drawings, digitally, designers, disagree, whether, computers, enhance, the, creative, process, some, designers, argue, that, computers, allow, them, to, explore, multiple, ideas, quickly, and, in, more, detail, than, can, be, achieved, by, hand, rendering, or, paste, up, while, other, designers, find, the, limitless, choices, from, digital, design, can, lead, to, paralysis, or, endless, iterations, with, no, clear, outcome, most, designers, use, a, hybrid, process, that, combines, traditional, and, computer, based, technologies, first, hand, rendered, layouts, are, used, to, get, approval, to, execute, an, idea, then, the, polished, visual, product, is, produced, on, a, computer, graphic, designers, are, expected, to, be, proficient, in, software, programs, for, image, making, typography, and, layout, nearly, all, of, the, popular, and, industry, standard, software, programs, used, by, graphic, designers, since, the, early, 1990s, are, products, of, adobe, inc, adobe, photoshop, a, raster, based, program, for, photo, editing, and, adobe, illustrator, a, vector, based, program, for, drawing, are, often, used, in, the, final, stage, coreldraw, a, vector, graphics, editing, software, developed, and, marketed, by, corel, corporation, is, also, used, worldwide, designers, often, use, pre, designed, raster, images, and, vector, graphics, in, their, work, from, online, design, databases, raster, images, may, be, edited, in, adobe, photoshop, vector, logos, and, illustrations, in, adobe, illustrator, and, coreldraw, and, the, final, product, assembled, in, one, of, the, major, page, layout, programs, such, as, adobe, indesign, serif, pageplus, and, quarkxpress, many, free, and, open, source, programs, are, also, used, by, both, professionals, and, casual, graphic, designers, inkscape, uses, scalable, vector, graphics, svg, as, its, primary, file, format, and, allows, importing, and, exporting, other, formats, other, open, source, programs, used, include, gimp, for, photo, editing, and, image, manipulation, krita, for, digital, painting, and, scribus, for, page, layout, a, specialized, branch, of, graphic, design, and, historically, its, earliest, form, print, design, involves, creating, visual, content, intended, for, reproduction, on, physical, substrates, such, as, silk, paper, and, later, plastic, for, mass, communication, and, persuasion, e, g, marketing, governmental, publishing, propaganda, print, design, techniques, have, evolved, over, centuries, beginning, with, the, invention, of, movable, type, by, the, chinese, alchemist, pi, sheng, later, refined, by, the, german, inventor, johannes, gutenberg, over, time, methods, such, as, lithography, screen, printing, and, offset, printing, have, been, developed, culminating, in, the, contemporary, use, of, digital, presses, that, integrate, traditional, print, techniques, with, modern, digital, technology, since, the, advent, of, personal, computers, many, graphic, designers, have, become, involved, in, interface, design, in, an, environment, commonly, referred, to, as, a, graphical, user, interface, gui, this, has, included, web, design, and, software, design, when, end, user, interactivity, is, a, design, consideration, of, the, layout, or, interface, combining, visual, communication, skills, with, an, understanding, of, user, interaction, and, online, branding, graphic, designers, often, work, with, software, developers, and, web, developers, to, create, the, look, and, feel, of, a, web, site, or, software, application, an, important, aspect, of, interface, design, is, icon, design, user, experience, design, ux, is, the, study, analysis, and, development, of, creating, products, that, provide, meaningful, and, relevant, experiences, to, users, this, involves, the, creation, of, the, entire, process, of, acquiring, and, integrating, the, product, including, aspects, of, branding, design, usability, and, function, ux, design, involves, creating, the, interface, and, interactions, for, a, website, or, application, and, is, considered, both, an, act, and, an, art, this, profession, requires, a, combination, of, skills, including, visual, design, social, psychology, development, project, management, and, most, importantly, empathy, towards, the, end, users, experiential, graphic, design, is, the, application, of, communication, skills, to, the, built, environment, this, area, of, graphic, design, requires, practitioners, to, understand, physical, installations, that, have, to, be, manufactured, and, withstand, the, same, environmental, conditions, as, buildings, as, such, it, is, a, cross, disciplinary, collaborative, process, involving, designers, fabricators, city, planners, architects, manufacturers, and, construction, teams, experiential, graphic, designers, try, to, solve, problems, that, people, encounter, while, interacting, with, buildings, and, space, also, called, environmental, graphic, design, examples, of, practice, areas, for, environmental, graphic, designers, are, wayfinding, placemaking, branded, environments, exhibitions, and, museum, displays, public, installations, and, digital, environments, graphic, design, career, paths, cover, all, parts, of, the, creative, spectrum, and, often, overlap, workers, perform, specialized, tasks, such, as, design, services, publishing, advertising, and, public, relations, as, of, 2023, median, pay, was, 50, 710, per, year, the, main, job, titles, within, the, industry, are, often, country, specific, they, can, include, graphic, designer, art, director, creative, director, animator, and, entry, level, production, artist, depending, on, the, industry, served, the, responsibilities, may, have, different, titles, such, as, dtp, associate, or, graphic, artist, the, responsibilities, may, involve, specialized, skills, such, as, illustration, photography, animation, visual, effects, or, interactive, design, employment, in, design, of, online, projects, was, expected, to, increase, by, 35, by, 2026, while, employment, in, traditional, media, such, as, newspaper, and, book, design, expect, to, go, down, by, 22, graphic, designers, will, be, expected, to, constantly, learn, new, techniques, programs, and, methods, graphic, designers, can, work, within, companies, devoted, specifically, to, the, industry, such, as, design, consultancies, or, branding, agencies, others, may, work, within, publishing, marketing, or, other, communications, companies, especially, since, the, introduction, of, personal, computers, many, graphic, designers, work, as, in, house, designers, in, non, design, oriented, organizations, graphic, designers, may, also, work, freelance, working, on, their, own, terms, prices, ideas, etc, a, graphic, designer, typically, reports, to, the, art, director, creative, director, or, senior, media, creative, as, a, designer, becomes, more, senior, they, spend, less, time, designing, and, more, time, leading, and, directing, other, designers, on, broader, creative, activities, such, as, brand, development, and, corporate, identity, development, they, are, often, expected, to, interact, more, directly, with, clients, for, example, taking, and, interpreting, briefs, jeff, howe, of, wired, magazine, first, used, the, term, crowdsourcing, in, his, 2006, article, the, rise, of, crowdsourcing, it, spans, such, creative, domains, as, graphic, design, architecture, apparel, design, writing, illustration, and, others, tasks, may, be, assigned, to, individuals, or, a, group, and, may, be, categorized, as, convergent, or, divergent, an, example, of, a, divergent, task, is, generating, alternative, designs, for, a, poster, an, example, of, a, convergent, task, is, selecting, one, poster, design, companies, startups, small, businesses, and, entrepreneurs, have, all, benefitted, from, design, crowdsourcing, since, it, helps, them, source, great, graphic, designs, at, a, fraction, of, the, budget, they, used, to, spend, before, getting, a, logo, design, through, crowdsourcing, being, one, of, the, most, common, major, companies, that, operate, in, the, design, crowdsourcing, space, are, generally, referred, to, as, design, contest, sites, graphic, design, is, essential, for, advertising, branding, and, marketing, influencing, how, people, act, good, graphic, design, builds, strong, recognizable, brands, communicates, messages, clearly, and, shapes, how, consumers, see, and, react, to, things, one, way, that, graphic, design, influences, consumer, behavior, is, through, the, use, of, visual, elements, such, as, color, typography, and, imagery, studies, have, shown, that, certain, colors, can, evoke, specific, emotions, and, behaviors, in, consumers, and, that, typography, can, influence, how, information, is, perceived, and, remembered, for, example, serif, fonts, are, often, associated, with, tradition, and, elegance, while, sans, serif, fonts, are, seen, as, modern, and, minimalistic, these, factors, can, all, impact, the, way, consumers, perceive, a, brand, and, its, messaging, another, way, that, graphic, design, impacts, consumer, behavior, is, through, its, ability, to, communicate, complex, information, in, a, clear, and, accessible, way, for, example, infographics, and, data, visualizations, can, help, to, distill, complex, information, into, a, format, that, is, easy, to, understand, and, engaging, for, consumers, this, can, help, to, build, trust, and, credibility, with, consumers, and, encourage, them, to, take, action, ethics, are, an, important, consideration, in, graphic, design, particularly, when, it, comes, to, accurately, representing, information, and, avoiding, harmful, stereotypes, graphic, designers, have, a, responsibility, to, ensure, that, their, work, is, truthful, accurate, and, free, from, any, misleading, or, deceptive, elements, this, requires, a, commitment, to, honesty, integrity, and, transparency, in, all, aspects, of, the, design, process, one, of, the, key, ethical, considerations, in, graphic, design, is, the, responsibility, to, accurately, represent, information, this, means, ensuring, that, any, claims, or, statements, made, in, advertising, or, marketing, materials, are, true, and, supported, by, evidence, for, example, a, company, should, not, use, misleading, statistics, to, promote, their, product, or, service, or, make, false, claims, about, its, benefits, graphic, designers, must, take, care, to, accurately, represent, information, in, all, visual, elements, such, as, graphs, charts, and, images, and, avoid, distorting, or, misrepresenting, data, another, important, ethical, consideration, in, graphic, design, is, the, need, to, avoid, harmful, stereotypes, this, means, avoiding, any, images, or, messaging, that, perpetuate, negative, or, harmful, stereotypes, based, on, race, gender, religion, or, other, characteristics, graphic, designers, should, strive, to, create, designs, that, are, inclusive, and, respectful, of, all, individuals, and, communities, and, avoid, reinforcing, negative, attitudes, or, biases, the, future, of, graphic, design, is, likely, to, be, heavily, influenced, by, emerging, technologies, and, social, trends, advancements, in, areas, such, as, artificial, intelligence, virtual, and, augmented, reality, and, automation, are, likely, to, transform, the, way, that, graphic, designers, work, and, create, designs, social, trends, such, as, a, greater, focus, on, sustainability, and, inclusivity, are, also, likely, to, impact, the, future, of, graphic, design, one, area, where, emerging, technologies, are, likely, to, have, a,
