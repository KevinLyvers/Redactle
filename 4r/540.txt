history, of, murals, several, methods, have, been, used, a, fresco, painting, from, the, italian, word, affresco, which, derives, from, the, adjective, fresco, fresh, describes, a, method, in, which, the, paint, is, applied, on, plaster, on, walls, or, ceilings, the, buon, fresco, technique, consists, of, painting, in, pigment, mixed, with, water, on, a, thin, layer, of, wet, fresh, lime, mortar, or, plaster, the, pigment, is, then, absorbed, by, the, wet, plaster, after, a, number, of, hours, the, plaster, dries, and, reacts, with, the, air, it, is, this, chemical, reaction, which, fixes, the, pigment, particles, in, the, plaster, after, this, the, painting, stays, for, a, long, time, up, to, centuries, in, fresh, and, brilliant, colors, fresco, secco, painting, is, done, on, dry, plaster, secco, is, dry, in, italian, the, pigments, thus, require, a, binding, medium, such, as, egg, tempera, glue, or, oil, to, attach, the, pigment, to, the, wall, mezzo, fresco, is, painted, on, nearly, dry, plaster, and, was, defined, by, the, sixteenth, century, author, ignazio, pozzo, as, firm, enough, not, to, take, a, thumb, print, so, that, the, pigment, only, penetrates, slightly, into, the, plaster, by, the, end, of, the, sixteenth, century, this, had, largely, displaced, the, buon, fresco, method, and, was, used, by, painters, such, as, gianbattista, tiepolo, or,

in, 16th, century, europe, oil, painting, on, canvas, arose, as, an, easier, method, for, mural, painting, the, advantage, was, that, the, artwork, could, be, completed, in, the, artist, s, studio, and, later, transported, to, its, destination, and, there, attached, to, the, wall, or, ceiling, oil, paint, may, be, a, less, satisfactory, medium, for, murals, because, of, its, lack, of, brilliance, in, colour, also, the, pigments, are, yellowed, by, the, binder, or, are, more, easily, affected, by, atmospheric, conditions, different, muralists, tend, to, become, experts, in, their, preferred, medium, and, application, whether, that, be, oil, paints, emulsion, or, acrylic, paints, applied, by, brush, roller, or, airbrush, aerosols, clients, will, often, ask, for, a, particular, style, and, the, artist, may, adjust, to, the, appropriate, technique, a, consultation, usually, leads, to, detailed, design, and, layout, of, the, proposed, mural, with, a, price, quote, that, the,
