and, tzipora, forever, the, remainder, of, night, describes, eliezer, s, efforts, not, to, be, parted, from, his, father, not, even, to, lose, sight, of, him, his, grief, and, shame, at, witnessing, his, father, s, decline, into, helplessness, and, as, their, relationship, changes, and, the, young, man, becomes, the, older, man, s, caregiver, his, resentment, and, guilt, because, his, father, s, existence, threatens, his, own, the, stronger, eliezer, s, need, to, survive, the, weaker, the, bonds, that, tie, him, to, other, people, his, loss, of, faith, in, human, relationships, is, mirrored, in, his, loss, of, faith, in, god, during, the, first, night, as, he, and, his, father, wait, in, line, he, watches, a, lorry, deliver, its, load, of, children, s, bodies, into, the, fire, while, his,

for, the, dead, for, themselves, eliezer, considers, throwing, himself, against, the, electric, fence, at, that, moment, he, and, his, father, are, ordered, to, go, to, their, barracks, but, eliezer, is, already, destroyed, he, student, of, the, talmud, the, child, that, i, was, had, been, consumed, in, the, flames, there, remained, only, a, shape, that, looked, like, me, there, follows, a, passage, that, ellen, fine, writes, contains, the, main, themes, of, night, the, death, of, god, and, innocence, and, the, d, faite, du, moi, dissolution, of, self, a, recurring, motif, in, holocaust, literature, never, shall, i, forget, that, night, the, first, night, in, camp, which, has, turned, my, life, into, one, long, night, seven, times, cursed, and, seven, times, sealed, never, shall, i, forget, that, smoke, never, shall, i, forget, the, little, faces, of, the, children, whose, bodies, i, saw, turned, into, wreaths, of, smoke, beneath, a, silent, blue, sky, never, shall, i, forget, those, flames, which, consumed, my, faith, forever, never, shall, i, forget, that, nocturnal, silence, which, deprived, me, for, all, eternity, of, the, desire, to, live, never, shall, i, forget, those, moments, which, murdered, my, god, and, my, soul, and, turned, my, dreams, to, dust, never, shall, i, forget, these, things, even, if, i, am, condemned, to, live, as, long, as, god, himself, never, with, the, loss, of, self, goes, eliezer, s, sense, of, time, i, glanced, at, my, father, how, he, had, changed, so, much, had, happened, within, such, a, few, hours, that, i, had, lost, all, sense, of, time, when, had, we, left, our, houses, and, the, ghetto, and, the, train, was, it, only, a, week, one, night, one, single, night, in, or, around, august, 1944, eliezer, and, his, father, are, transferred, from, birkenau, to, the, work, camp, at, monowitz, known, as, buna, or, auschwitz, iii, their, lives, reduced, to, the, avoidance, of, violence, and, the, search, for, food, their, only, joy, is, when, the, americans, bomb, the, camp, god, is, not, lost, to, eliezer, entirely, during, the, hanging, of, a, child, which, the, camp, is, forced, to, watch, he, hears, someone, ask, where, is, god, where, is, he, not, heavy, enough, for, the, weight, of, his, body, to, break, his, neck, the, boy, dies, slowly, wiesel, files, past, him, sees, his, tongue, still, pink, and, his, eyes, clear, behind, me, i, heard, the, same, man, asking, where, is, god, now, and, i, heard, a, voice, within, me, answer, him, here, he, is, he, is, hanging, here, on, this, gallows, fine, writes, that, this, is, the, central, event, in, night, a, religious, sacrifice, the, binding, of, isaac, and, crucifixion, of, jesus, described, by, alfred, kazin, as, the, literal, death, of, god, afterwards, the, inmates, celebrate, rosh, hashanah, the, jewish, new, year, but, eliezer, cannot, take, part, blessed, be, god, s, name, why, but, why, would, i, bless, him, every, fiber, in, me, rebelled, how, could, i, say, to, him, blessed, be, thou, almighty, master, of, the, universe, who, chose, us, among, all, nations, to, be, tortured, day, and, night, to, watch, as, our, fathers, our, mothers, our, brothers, end, up, in, the, furnaces, but, now, i, no, longer, pleaded, for, anything, i, was, no, longer, able, to, lament, on, the, contrary, i, felt, very, strong, i, was, the, accuser, god, the, accused, in, january, 1945, with, the, soviet, army, approaching, the, germans, decide, to, flee, taking, 60, 000, inmates, on, a, death, march, to, concentration, camps, in,

darkness, every, now, and, then, an, explosion, in, the, night, they, had, orders, to, fire, on, any, who, could, not, keep, up, their, fingers, on, the, triggers, they, did, not, deprive, themselves, of, this, pleasure, if, one, of, us, had, stopped, for, a, second, a, sharp, shot, finished, off, another, filthy, son, of, a, bitch, near, me, men, were, collapsing, in, the, dirty, snow, shots, resting, in, a, shed, after, marching, over, 40, miles, 64, km, rabbi, eliahou, asks, if, anyone, has, seen, his, son, they, had, stuck, together, for, three, years, always, near, each, other, for, suffering, for, blows, for, the, ration, of, bread, for, prayer, but, the, rabbi, had, lost, sight, of, him, in, the, crowd, and, was, now, scratching, through, the, snow, looking, for, his, son, s, corpse, i, hadn, t, any, strength, left, for, running, and, my, son, didn, t, notice, that, s, all, i, know, eliezer, does, not, tell, the, man, that, his, son, had, indeed, noticed, his, father, limping, and, had, run, faster, letting, the, distance, between, them, grow, and, in, spite, of, myself, a, prayer, rose, in, my, heart, to, that, god, in, whom, i, no, longer, believed, my, god, lord, of, the, universe, give, me, strength, never, to, do, what, rabbi, eliahou, s, son, has, done, the, inmates, spend, two, days, and, nights, in, gleiwitz, locked, inside, cramped, barracks, without, food, water, or, heat, sleeping, on, top, of, one, another, so, that, each, morning, the, living, wake, with, the, dead, underneath, them, there, is, more, marching, to, the, train, station, and, onto, a, cattle, wagon, with, no, roof, they, travel, for, ten, days, and, nights, with, only, the, snow, falling, on, them, for, water, of, the, 100, in, eliezer, s, wagon, 12, survive, the, journey, the, living, make, space, by, throwing, the, dead, onto, the, tracks, i, woke, from, my, apathy, just, at, the, moment, when, two, men, came, up, to, my, father, i, threw, myself, on, top, of, his, body, he, was, cold, i, slapped, him, i, rubbed, his, hand, crying, father, father, wake, up, they, re, trying, to, throw, you, out, of, the, carriage, his, body, remained, inert, i, set, to, work, to, slap, him, as, hard, as, i, could, after, a, moment, my, father, s, eyelids, moved, slightly, over, his, glazed, eyes, he, was, breathing, weakly, you, see, i, cried, the, two, men, moved, away, the, germans, are, waiting, with, megaphones, and, orders, to, head, for, a, hot, bath, wiesel, is, desperate, for, the, heat, of, the, water, but, his, father, sinks, into, the, snow, i, could, have, wept, with, rage, i, showed, him, the, corpses, all, around, him, they, too, had, wanted, to, rest, here, i, yelled, against, the, wind, i, felt, i, was, not, arguing, with, him, but, with, death, itself, with, the, death, he, had, already, chosen, an, alert, sounds, the, camp, lights, go, out, and, eliezer, exhausted, follows, the, crowd, to, the, barracks, leaving, his, father, behind, he, wakes, at, dawn, on, a, wooden, bunk, remembering, that, he, has, a, father, and, goes, in, search, of, him, but, at, that, same, moment, this, thought, came, into, my, mind, don, t, let, me, find, him, if, only, i, could, get, rid, of, this, dead, weight, so, that, i, could, use, all, my, strength, to, struggle, for, my, own, survival, and, only, worry, about, myself, immediately, i, felt, ashamed, of, myself, ashamed, forever, his, father, is, in, another, block, sick, with, dysentery, the, other, men, in, his, bunk, a, frenchman, and, a, pole, attack, him, because, he, can, no, longer, go, outside, to, relieve, himself, eliezer, is, unable, to, protect, him, another, wound, to, the, heart, another, hate, another, reason, for, living, lost, begging, for, water, one, night, from, his, bunk, where, he, has, lain, for, a, week, chlomo, is, beaten, on, the, head, with, a, truncheon, by, an, ss, officer, for, making, too, much, noise, eliezer, lies, in, the, bunk, above,

place, the, kapos, had, come, before, dawn, and, taken, chlomo, to, the, crematorium, his, last, word, was, my, name, a, summons, to, which, i, did, not, respond, i, did, not, weep, and, it, pained, me, that, i, could, not, weep, but, i, had, no, more, tears, and, in, the, depths, of, my, being, in, the, recesses, of, my, weakened, conscience, could, i, have, searched, for, it, i, might, perhaps, have, found, something, like, free, at, last, chlomo, missed, his, freedom, by, three, months, the, soviets, had, liberated, auschwitz, 11, days, earlier, and, the, americans, were, making, their, way, towards, buchenwald, eliezer, is, transferred, to, the, children, s, block, where, he, stays, with, 600, others, dreaming, of, soup, on, 5, april, 1945, the, inmates, are, told, the, camp, is,

who, suffered, more, than, jesus, did, on, his, cross, and, we, do, not, speak, about, it, i, felt, all, of, a, sudden, so, embarrassed, i, closed, my, notebook, and, went, to, the, elevator, he, ran, after, me, he, pulled, me, back, he, sat, down, in, his, chair, and, i, in, mine, and, he, began, weeping, and, then, at, the, end, without, saying, anything, he, simply, said, you, know, maybe, you,

1966, ruth, wisse, writes, that, un, di, velt, hot, geshvign, stood, out, from, the, rest, of, the, series, which, survivors, wrote, as, memorials, to, their, dead, as, a, highly, selective, and, isolating, literary, narrative, in, the, late, 1950s, wiesel, wrote, a, manuscript, that, he, intended, to, turn, into, a, special, expanded, hebrew, language, version, of, night, however, before, completion, wiesel, places, the, unfinished, text, in, his, archive, later, discovered, in, 2016, by, wiesel, s, friend, yoel, rappel, a, historian, and, curator, of, his, archive, at, boston, university, the, archived, version, included, harsh, criticisms, of, jews, who, were, too, optimistic, about, the, future, jewish, leaders, who, did, not, speak, up, and, wiesel, s, hungarian, neighbors, who, joyously, watched, the, jews, being, deported, these, were, not, included, in, the, english, language, version, later, published, in, 1960, according, to, rappel, this, version, of, night, was, intended, for, an, israeli, audience, including, survivors, from, auschwitz, and, buchenwald, living, in, israel, wiesel, translated, un, di, velt, hot, geshvign, into, french, and, in, 1955, sent, it, to, mauriac, even, with, mauriac, s, help, they, had, difficulty, finding, a, publisher, wiesel, said, they, found, it, too, morbid, j, r, me, lindon, of, les, ditions, de, minuit,

was, dedicated, to, chlomo, sarah, and, tzipora, wiesel, s, new, york, agent, georges, borchardt, encountered, the, same, difficulty, finding, a, publisher, in, the, united, states, in, 1960, arthur, wang, of, hill, wang, in, new, york, who, wiesel, writes, believed, in, literature, as, others, believe, in, god, paid, a, 100, pro, forma, advance, and, published, that, year, a, 116, page, english, translation, by, stella, rodway, as, night, the, first, 18, months, saw, 1, 046, copies, sell, at, 3, each, and, it, took, three, years, to, sell, the, first, print, run, of, 3, 000, copies, but, the, book, attracted, interest, from, reviewers, leading, to, television, interviews, and, meetings, with, literary, figures, like, saul, bellow, by, 1997, night, was, selling, 300, 000, copies, a, year, in, the, united, states, by, 2011, it, had, sold, six, million, copies, in, that, country, and, was, available, in, 30, languages, sales, increased, in, january, 2006, when, it, was, chosen, for, oprah, s, book, club, republished, with, a, new, translation, by, marion, wiesel, wiesel, s, wife, and, a, new, preface, by, wiesel, it, sat, at, no, 1, in, the, new, york, times, bestseller, list, for, paperback, non, fiction, for, 18, months, from, 13, february, 2006, until, the, newspaper, removed, it, when, a, significant, portion, of, sales, were, ascribed, to, educational, usage, rather, than, retail, sales, it, became, the, club, s, third, bestseller, to, date, with, over, two, million, sales, of, the, book, club, edition, by, may, 2011, reviewers, have, had, difficulty, reading, night, as, an, eyewitness, account, according, to, literary, scholar, gary, weissman, it, has, been, categorized, as, a, novel, autobiography, autobiographical, novel, non, fictional, novel, semi, fictional, memoir, fictional, autobiographical, novel, fictionalized, autobiographical, memoir, and, memoir, novel, ellen, fine, described, it, as, t, moignage, testimony, wiesel, called, it, his, deposition, literary, critic, ruth, franklin, writes, that, night, s, impact, stems, from, its, minimalist, construction, the, 1954, yiddish, manuscript, at, 862, pages, was, a, long, and, angry, historical, work, in, preparing, the, yiddish, and, then, the, french, editions, wiesel, s, editors, pruned, mercilessly, franklin, argues, that, the, power, of, the, narrative, was, achieved, at, the, cost, of, literal, truth, and, that, to, insist, that, the, work, is, purely, factual, is, to, ignore, its, literary, sophistication, holocaust, scholar, lawrence, langer, argues, similarly, that, wiesel, evokes, rather, than, describes, wiesel, s, account, is, ballasted, with, the, freight, of, fiction, scenic, organization, characterization, through, dialogue, periodic, climaxes, elimination, of, superfluous, or, repetitive, episodes, and, especially, an, ability, to, arouse, the, empathy, of, his, readers, which, is, an, elusive, ideal, of, the, writer, bound, by, fidelity, to, fact, franklin, writes, that, night, is, the, account, of, the, 15, year, old, eliezer, a, semi, fictional, construct, told, by, the, 25, year, old, elie, wiesel, this, allows, the, 15, year, old, to, tell, his, story, from, the, post, holocaust, vantage, point, of, night, s, readers, in, a, comparative, analysis, of, the, yiddish, and, french, texts, naomi, seidman, professor, of, jewish, culture, concludes, that, there, are, two, survivors, in, wiesel, s, writing, a, yiddish, and, french, in, re, writing, rather, than, simply, translating, un, di, velt, hot, geshvign, wiesel, replaced, an, angry, survivor, who, regards, testimony, as, a, refutation, of, what, the, nazis, did, to, the, jews, with, one, haunted, by, death, whose, primary, complaint, is, directed, against, god, night, transformed, the, holocaust, into, a, religious, event, seidman, argues, that, the, yiddish, version, was, for, jewish, readers, who, wanted, to, hear, about, revenge, but, the, anger, was, removed, for, the, largely, christian, readership, of, the, french, translation, in, the, yiddish, edition, for, example, when, buchenwald, was, liberated, early, the, next, day, jewish, boys, ran, off, to, weimar, to, steal, clothing, and, potatoes, and, to, rape, german, shiksas, the, historical, commandment, of, revenge, was, not, fulfilled, in, the, 1958, french, and, 1960, english, editions, this, became, on, the, following, morning, some, of, the, young, men, went, to, weimar, to, get, some, potatoes, and, clothes, and, to, sleep, with, girls, but, of, revenge, not, a, sign, oprah, winfrey, s, promotion, of, night, came, at, a, difficult, time, for, the, genre, of, memoir, franklin, writes, after, a, previous, book, club, author, james, frey, was, found, to, have, fabricated, parts, of, his, autobiography, a, million, little, pieces, 2003, she, argues, that, winfrey, s, choice, of, night, may, have, been, intended, to, restore, the, book, club, s, credibility, wiesel, wrote, in, 1967, about, a, visit, to, a, rebbe, a, hasidic, rabbi, who, he, had, not, seen, for, 20, years, the, rebbe, is, upset, to, learn, that, wiesel, has, become, a, writer, and, wants, to, know, what, he, writes, stories, wiesel, tells, him, true, stories, about, people, you, knew, yes, about, people, i, might, have, known, about, things, that, happened, yes, about, things, that, happened, or, could, have, happened, but, they, did, not, no, not, all, of, them, did, in, fact, some, were, invented, from, almost, the, beginning, to, almost, the, end, the, rebbe, leaned, forward, as, if, to, measure, me, up, and, said, with, more, sorrow, than, anger, that, means, you, are, writing, lies, i, did, not, answer, immediately, the, scolded, child, within, me, had, nothing, to, say, in, his, defense, yet, i, had, to, justify, myself, things, are, not, that, simple, rebbe, some, events, do, take, place, but, are, not, true, others, are, although, they, never, occurred, wiesel,
