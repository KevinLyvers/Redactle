romanticism, also, known, as, the, romantic, movement, or, romantic, era, was, an, artistic, and, intellectual, movement, that, originated, in, europe, towards, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, the, purpose, of, the, movement, was, to, advocate, for, the, importance, of, subjectivity, imagination, and, appreciation, of, nature, in, society, and, culture, in, response, to, the, age, of, enlightenment, and, the, industrial, revolution, romanticists, rejected, the, social, conventions, of, the, time, in, favour, of, a, moral, outlook, known, as, individualism, they, argued, that, passion, and, intuition, were, crucial, to, understanding, the, world, and, that, beauty, is, more, than, merely, an, affair, of, form, but, rather, something, that, evokes, a, strong, emotional, response, with, this, philosophical, foundation, the, romanticists, elevated, several, key, themes, to, which, they, were, deeply, committed, a, reverence, for, nature, and, the, supernatural, an, idealization, of, the, past, as, a, nobler, era, a, fascination, with, the, exotic, and, the, mysterious, and, a, celebration, of, the, heroic, and, the, sublime, the, romanticist, movement, had, a, particular, fondness, for, the, middle, ages, which, to, them, represented, an, era, of, chivalry, heroism, and, a, more, organic, relationship, between, humans, and, their, environment, this, idealization, contrasted, sharply, with, the, values, of, their, contemporary, industrial, society, which, they, considered, alienating, for, its, economic, materialism, and, environmental, degradation, the, movement, s, illustration, of, the, middle, ages, was, a, central, theme, in, debates, with, allegations, that, romanticist, portrayals, often, overlooked, the, downsides, of, medieval, life, the, consensus, is, that, romanticism, peaked, from, 1800, until, 1850, however, a, late, romantic, period, and, neoromantic, revivals, are, also, discussed, these, extensions, of, the, movement, are, characterized, by, a, resistance, to, the, increasingly, experimental, and, abstract, forms, that, culminated, in, modern, art, and, the, deconstruction, of, traditional, tonal, harmony, in, music, they, continued, the, romantic, ideal, stressing, depth, of, emotion, in, art, and, music, while, showcasing, technical, mastery, in, a, mature, romantic, style, by, the, time, of, world, war, i, though, the, cultural, and, artistic, climate, had, changed, to, such, a, degree, that, romanticism, essentially, dispersed, into, subsequent, movements, the, final, late, romanticist, figures, to, maintain, the, romantic, ideals, died, in, the, 1940s, though, they, were, still, widely, respected, they, were, seen, as, anachronisms, at, that, point, romanticism, was, a, complex, movement, with, a, variety, of, viewpoints, that, permeated, western, civilization, across, the, globe, the, movement, and, its, opposing, ideologies, mutually, shaped, each, other, over, time, after, its, end, romantic, thought, and, art, exerted, a, sweeping, influence, on, art, and, music, speculative, fiction, philosophy, politics, and, environmentalism, that, has, endured, to, the, present, day, the, movement, is, the, reference, for, the, modern, notion, of, romanticization, and, the, act, of, romanticizing, something, for, most, of, the, western, world, romanticism, was, at, its, peak, from, approximately, 1800, to, 1850, the, first, romantic, ideas, arose, from, an, earlier, german, counter, enlightenment, movement, called, sturm, und, drang, german, storm, and, stress, this, movement, directly, criticized, the, enlightenment, s, position, that, humans, can, fully, comprehend, the, world, through, rationality, alone, suggesting, that, intuition, and, emotion, are, key, components, of, insight, and, understanding, published, in, 1774, the, sorrows, of, young, werther, by, johann, wolfgang, von, goethe, began, to, shape, the, romanticist, movement, and, its, ideals, the, events, and, ideologies, of, the, french, revolution, were, also, direct, influences, on, the, movement, many, early, romantics, throughout, europe, sympathized, with, the, ideals, and, achievements, of, french, revolutionaries, a, confluence, of, circumstances, led, to, romanticism, s, decline, in, the, mid, 19th, century, including, but, not, limited, to, the, rise, of, realism, and, naturalism, charles, darwin, s, publishing, of, the, origin, of, species, the, transition, from, widespread, revolution, in, europe, to, a, more, conservative, climate, and, a, shift, in, public, consciousness, to, the, immediate, impact, of, technology, and, urbanization, on, the, working, class, by, world, war, i, romanticism, was, overshadowed, by, new, cultural, social, and, political, movements, many, of, them, hostile, to, the, perceived, illusions, and, preoccupations, of, the, romantics, however, romanticism, has, had, a, lasting, impact, on, western, civilization, and, many, works, of, art, music, and, literature, that, embody, the, romantic, ideals, have, been, made, after, the, end, of, the, romantic, era, the, movement, s, advocacy, for, nature, appreciation, is, cited, as, an, influence, for, current, nature, conservation, efforts, the, majority, of, film, scores, from, the, golden, age, of, hollywood, were, written, in, the, lush, orchestral, romantic, style, and, this, genre, of, orchestral, cinematic, music, is, still, often, seen, in, films, of, the, 21st, century, the, philosophical, underpinnings, of, the, movement, have, influenced, modern, political, theory, both, among, liberals, and, conservatives, romanticism, was, characterized, by, its, emphasis, on, emotion, and, individualism, as, well, as, the, glorification, of, the, past, and, nature, preferring, the, medieval, over, the, classical, romanticism, was, partly, a, reaction, to, the, industrial, revolution, and, the, prevailing, ideology, of, the, age, of, enlightenment, especially, the, scientific, rationalization, of, nature, the, movement, s, ideals, were, embodied, most, strongly, in, the, visual, arts, music, and, literature, it, also, had, a, major, impact, on, historiography, education, chess, social, sciences, and, the, natural, sciences, romanticism, had, a, significant, and, complex, effect, on, politics, romantic, thinking, influenced, conservatism, liberalism, radicalism, and, nationalism, romanticism, prioritized, the, artist, s, unique, individual, imagination, above, the, strictures, of, classical, form, the, movement, emphasized, intense, emotion, as, an, authentic, source, of, aesthetic, experience, it, granted, a, new, importance, to, experiences, of, sympathy, awe, wonder, and, terror, in, part, by, naturalizing, such, emotions, as, responses, to, the, beautiful, and, the, sublime, romantics, stressed, the, nobility, of, folk, art, and, ancient, cultural, practices, but, also, championed, radical, politics, unconventional, behavior, and, authentic, spontaneity, in, contrast, to, the, rationalism, and, classicism, of, the, enlightenment, romanticism, revived, medievalism, and, juxtaposed, a, pastoral, conception, of, a, more, authentic, european, past, with, a, highly, critical, view, of, recent, social, changes, including, urbanization, brought, about, by, the, industrial, revolution, romanticism, lionized, the, achievements, of, heroic, individuals, especially, artists, who, began, to, be, represented, as, cultural, leaders, one, romantic, luminary, percy, bysshe, shelley, described, poets, as, the, unacknowledged, legislators, of, the, world, in, his, defence, of, poetry, romanticism, placed, the, highest, importance, on, the, freedom, of, the, artists, to, authentically, express, their, sentiments, and, ideas, romantics, like, the, german, painter, caspar, david, friedrich, believed, that, an, artist, s, emotions, should, dictate, their, formal, approach, friedrich, went, as, far, as, declaring, that, the, artist, s, feeling, is, his, law, the, romantic, poet, william, wordsworth, thinking, along, similar, lines, wrote, that, poetry, should, begin, with, the, spontaneous, overflow, of, powerful, feelings, which, the, poet, then, recollect, in, tranquility, enabling, the, poet, to, find, a, suitably, unique, form, for, representing, such, feelings, the, romantics, never, doubted, that, emotionally, motivated, art, would, find, suitable, harmonious, modes, for, expressing, its, vital, content, if, that, is, the, artist, steered, clear, of, moribund, conventions, and, distracting, precedents, samuel, taylor, coleridge, and, others, thought, there, were, natural, laws, the, imagination, of, born, artists, followed, instinctively, when, these, individuals, were, so, to, speak, left, alone, during, the, creative, process, these, natural, laws, could, support, a, wide, range, of, different, formal, approaches, as, many, perhaps, as, there, were, individuals, making, personally, meaningful, works, of, art, many, romantics, believed, that, works, of, artistic, genius, were, created, ex, nihilo, from, nothing, without, recourse, to, existing, models, this, idea, is, often, called, romantic, originality, the, translator, and, prominent, romantic, august, wilhelm, schlegel, argued, in, his, lectures, on, dramatic, arts, and, letters, that, the, most, valuable, quality, of, human, nature, is, its, tendency, to, diverge, and, diversify, according, to, isaiah, berlin, romanticism, embodied, a, new, and, restless, spirit, seeking, violently, to, burst, through, old, and, cramping, forms, a, nervous, preoccupation, with, perpetually, changing, inner, states, of, consciousness, a, longing, for, the, unbounded, and, the, indefinable, for, perpetual, movement, and, change, an, effort, to, return, to, the, forgotten, sources, of, life, a, passionate, effort, at, self, assertion, both, individual, and, collective, a, search, after, means, of, expressing, an, unappeasable, yearning, for, unattainable, goals, romantic, artists, also, shared, a, strong, belief, in, the, importance, and, inspirational, qualities, of, nature, romantics, were, distrustful, of, cities, and, social, conventions, they, deplored, restoration, and, enlightenment, era, artists, who, were, largely, concerned, with, depicting, and, critiquing, social, relations, thereby, neglecting, the, relationship, between, people, and, nature, romantics, generally, believed, a, close, connection, with, nature, was, beneficial, for, human, beings, especially, for, individuals, who, broke, off, from, society, in, order, to, encounter, the, natural, world, by, themselves, romantic, literature, was, frequently, written, in, a, distinctive, personal, voice, as, critic, m, h, abrams, has, observed, much, of, romantic, poetry, invited, the, reader, to, identify, the, protagonists, with, the, poets, themselves, this, quality, in, romantic, literature, in, turn, influenced, the, approach, and, reception, of, works, in, other, media, it, has, seeped, into, everything, from, critical, evaluations, of, individual, style, in, painting, fashion, and, music, to, the, auteur, movement, in, modern, filmmaking, the, group, of, words, with, the, root, roman, in, the, various, european, languages, such, as, romance, and, romanesque, has, a, complicated, history, by, the, 18th, century, european, languages, notably, german, french, and, slavic, languages, were, using, the, term, roman, in, the, sense, of, the, english, word, novel, i, e, a, work, of, popular, narrative, fiction, this, usage, derived, from, the, term, romance, languages, which, referred, to, vernacular, or, popular, language, in, contrast, to, formal, latin, most, such, novels, took, the, form, of, chivalric, romance, tales, of, adventure, devotion, and, honour, the, founders, of, romanticism, critics, and, brothers, august, wilhelm, schlegel, and, friedrich, schlegel, began, to, speak, of, romantische, poesie, romantic, poetry, in, the, 1790s, contrasting, it, with, classic, but, in, terms, of, spirit, rather, than, merely, dating, friedrich, schlegel, wrote, in, his, 1800, essay, gespr, ch, ber, die, poesie, dialogue, on, poetry, the, modern, sense, of, the, term, spread, more, widely, in, france, by, its, persistent, use, by, germaine, de, sta, l, in, her, de, l, allemagne, 1813, recounting, her, travels, in, germany, in, england, wordsworth, wrote, in, a, preface, to, his, poems, of, 1815, of, the, romantic, harp, and, classic, lyre, but, in, 1820, byron, could, still, write, perhaps, slightly, disingenuously, it, is, only, from, the, 1820s, that, romanticism, certainly, knew, itself, by, its, name, and, in, 1824, the, acad, mie, fran, aise, took, the, wholly, ineffective, step, of, issuing, a, decree, condemning, it, in, literature, the, period, typically, called, romantic, varies, greatly, between, different, countries, and, different, artistic, media, or, areas, of, thought, margaret, drabble, described, it, in, literature, as, taking, place, roughly, between, 1770, and, 1848, and, few, dates, much, earlier, than, 1770, will, be, found, in, english, literature, m, h, abrams, placed, it, between, 1789, or, 1798, this, latter, a, very, typical, view, and, about, 1830, perhaps, a, little, later, than, some, other, critics, others, have, proposed, 1780, 1830, in, other, fields, and, other, countries, the, period, denominated, as, romantic, can, be, considerably, different, musical, romanticism, for, example, is, generally, regarded, as, only, having, ceased, as, a, major, artistic, force, as, late, as, 1910, but, in, an, extreme, extension, the, four, last, songs, of, richard, strauss, are, described, stylistically, as, late, romantic, and, were, composed, in, 1946, 1948, however, in, most, fields, the, romantic, period, is, said, to, be, over, by, about, 1850, or, earlier, the, early, period, of, the, romantic, era, was, a, time, of, war, with, the, french, revolution, 1789, 1799, followed, by, the, napoleonic, wars, until, 1815, these, wars, along, with, the, political, and, social, turmoil, that, went, along, with, them, served, as, the, background, for, romanticism, the, key, generation, of, french, romantics, born, between, 1795, and, 1805, had, in, the, words, of, one, of, their, number, alfred, de, vigny, been, conceived, between, battles, attended, school, to, the, rolling, of, drums, according, to, jacques, barzun, there, were, three, generations, of, romantic, artists, the, first, emerged, in, the, 1790s, and, 1800s, the, second, in, the, 1820s, and, the, third, later, in, the, century, the, more, precise, characterization, and, specific, definition, of, romanticism, has, been, the, subject, of, debate, in, the, fields, of, intellectual, history, and, literary, history, throughout, the, 20th, century, without, any, great, measure, of, consensus, emerging, that, it, was, part, of, the, counter, enlightenment, a, reaction, against, the, age, of, enlightenment, is, generally, accepted, in, current, scholarship, its, relationship, to, the, french, revolution, which, began, in, 1789, in, the, very, early, stages, of, the, period, is, clearly, important, but, highly, variable, depending, on, geography, and, individual, reactions, most, romantics, can, be, said, to, be, broadly, progressive, in, their, views, but, a, considerable, number, always, had, or, developed, a, wide, range, of, conservative, views, and, nationalism, was, in, many, countries, strongly, associated, with, romanticism, as, discussed, in, detail, below, in, philosophy, and, the, history, of, ideas, romanticism, was, seen, by, isaiah, berlin, as, disrupting, for, over, a, century, the, classic, western, traditions, of, rationality, and, the, idea, of, moral, absolutes, and, agreed, values, leading, to, something, like, the, melting, away, of, the, very, notion, of, objective, truth, and, hence, not, only, to, nationalism, but, also, fascism, and, totalitarianism, with, a, gradual, recovery, coming, only, after, world, war, ii, for, the, romantics, berlin, says, in, the, realm, of, ethics, politics, aesthetics, it, was, the, authenticity, and, sincerity, of, the, pursuit, of, inner, goals, that, mattered, this, applied, equally, to, individuals, and, groups, states, nations, movements, this, is, most, evident, in, the, aesthetics, of, romanticism, where, the, notion, of, eternal, models, a, platonic, vision, of, ideal, beauty, which, the, artist, seeks, to, convey, however, imperfectly, on, canvas, or, in, sound, is, replaced, by, a, passionate, belief, in, spiritual, freedom, individual, creativity, the, painter, the, poet, the, composer, do, not, hold, up, a, mirror, to, nature, however, ideal, but, invent, they, do, not, imitate, the, doctrine, of, mimesis, but, create, not, merely, the, means, but, the, goals, that, they, pursue, these, goals, represent, the, self, expression, of, the, artist, s, own, unique, inner, vision, to, set, aside, which, in, response, to, the, demands, of, some, external, voice, church, state, public, opinion, family, friends, arbiters, of, taste, is, an, act, of, betrayal, of, what, alone, justifies, their, existence, for, those, who, are, in, any, sense, creative, arthur, lovejoy, attempted, to, demonstrate, the, difficulty, of, defining, romanticism, in, his, seminal, article, on, the, discrimination, of, romanticisms, in, his, essays, in, the, history, of, ideas, 1948, some, scholars, see, romanticism, as, essentially, continuous, with, the, present, some, like, robert, hughes, see, in, it, the, inaugural, moment, of, modernity, while, writers, of, the, 19th, century, such, as, chateaubriand, novalis, and, samuel, taylor, coleridge, saw, it, as, the, beginning, of, a, tradition, of, resistance, to, enlightenment, rationalism, a, counter, enlightenment, to, be, associated, most, closely, with, german, romanticism, another, early, definition, comes, from, charles, baudelaire, romanticism, is, precisely, situated, neither, in, choice, of, subject, nor, exact, truth, but, in, the, way, of, feeling, the, end, of, the, romantic, era, is, marked, in, some, areas, by, a, new, style, of, realism, which, affected, literature, especially, the, novel, and, drama, painting, and, even, music, through, verismo, opera, this, movement, was, led, by, france, with, balzac, and, flaubert, in, literature, and, courbet, in, painting, stendhal, and, goya, were, important, precursors, of, realism, in, their, respective, media, however, romantic, styles, now, often, representing, the, established, and, safe, style, against, which, realists, rebelled, continued, to, flourish, in, many, fields, for, the, rest, of, the, century, and, beyond, in, music, such, works, from, after, about, 1850, are, referred, to, by, some, writers, as, late, romantic, and, by, others, as, neoromantic, or, postromantic, but, other, fields, do, not, usually, use, these, terms, in, english, literature, and, painting, the, convenient, term, victorian, avoids, having, to, characterise, the, period, further, in, northern, europe, the, early, romantic, visionary, optimism, and, belief, that, the, world, was, in, the, process, of, great, change, and, improvement, had, largely, vanished, and, some, art, became, more, conventionally, political, and, polemical, as, its, creators, engaged, polemically, with, the, world, as, it, was, elsewhere, including, in, very, different, ways, the, united, states, and, russia, feelings, that, great, change, was, underway, or, just, about, to, come, were, still, possible, displays, of, intense, emotion, in, art, remained, prominent, as, did, the, exotic, and, historical, settings, pioneered, by, the, romantics, but, experimentation, with, form, and, technique, was, generally, reduced, often, replaced, with, meticulous, technique, as, in, the, poems, of, tennyson, or, many, paintings, if, not, realist, late, 19th, century, art, was, often, extremely, detailed, and, pride, was, taken, in, adding, authentic, details, in, a, way, that, earlier, romantics, did, not, trouble, with, many, romantic, ideas, about, the, nature, and, purpose, of, art, above, all, the, pre, eminent, importance, of, originality, remained, important, for, later, generations, and, often, underlie, modern, views, despite, opposition, from, theorists, in, literature, romanticism, found, recurrent, themes, in, the, evocation, or, criticism, of, the, past, the, cult, of, sensibility, with, its, emphasis, on, women, and, children, the, isolation, of, the, artist, or, narrator, and, respect, for, nature, furthermore, several, romantic, authors, such, as, edgar, allan, poe, charles, maturin, and, nathaniel, hawthorne, based, their, writings, on, the, supernatural, occult, and, human, psychology, romanticism, tended, to, regard, satire, as, something, unworthy, of, serious, attention, a, view, still, influential, today, the, romantic, movement, in, literature, was, preceded, by, the, enlightenment, and, succeeded, by, realism, the, precursors, of, romanticism, in, english, poetry, go, back, to, the, middle, of, the, 18th, century, including, figures, such, as, joseph, warton, headmaster, at, winchester, college, and, his, brother, thomas, warton, professor, of, poetry, at, oxford, university, joseph, maintained, that, invention, and, imagination, were, the, chief, qualities, of, a, poet, the, scottish, poet, james, macpherson, influenced, the, early, development, of, romanticism, with, the, international, success, of, his, ossian, cycle, of, poems, published, in, 1762, inspiring, both, goethe, and, the, young, walter, scott, thomas, chatterton, is, generally, considered, the, first, romantic, poet, in, english, both, chatterton, and, macpherson, s, work, involved, elements, of, fraud, as, what, they, claimed, was, earlier, literature, that, they, had, discovered, or, compiled, was, in, fact, entirely, their, own, work, the, gothic, novel, beginning, with, horace, walpole, s, the, castle, of, otranto, 1764, was, an, important, precursor, of, one, strain, of, romanticism, with, a, delight, in, horror, and, threat, and, exotic, picturesque, settings, matched, in, walpole, s, case, by, his, role, in, the, early, revival, of, gothic, architecture, tristram, shandy, a, novel, by, laurence, sterne, 1759, 1767, introduced, a, whimsical, version, of, the, anti, rational, sentimental, novel, to, the, english, literary, public, an, early, german, influence, came, from, johann, wolfgang, von, goethe, whose, 1774, novel, the, sorrows, of, young, werther, had, young, men, throughout, europe, emulating, its, protagonist, a, young, artist, with, a, very, sensitive, and, passionate, temperament, at, that, time, germany, was, a, multitude, of, small, separate, states, and, goethe, s, works, would, have, a, seminal, influence, in, developing, a, unifying, sense, of, nationalism, another, philosophic, influence, came, from, the, german, idealism, of, johann, gottlieb, fichte, and, friedrich, schelling, making, jena, where, fichte, lived, as, well, as, schelling, hegel, schiller, and, the, brothers, schlegel, a, centre, for, early, german, romanticism, see, jena, romanticism, important, writers, were, ludwig, tieck, novalis, heinrich, von, kleist, and, friedrich, h, lderlin, heidelberg, later, became, a, centre, of, german, romanticism, where, writers, and, poets, such, as, clemens, brentano, achim, von, arnim, and, joseph, freiherr, von, eichendorff, aus, dem, leben, eines, taugenichts, met, regularly, in, literary, circles, important, motifs, in, german, romanticism, are, travelling, nature, for, example, the, german, forest, and, germanic, myths, the, later, german, romanticism, of, for, example, e, t, a, hoffmann, s, der, sandmann, the, sandman, 1817, and, joseph, freiherr, von, eichendorff, s, das, marmorbild, the, marble, statue, 1819, was, darker, in, its, motifs, and, has, gothic, elements, the, significance, to, romanticism, of, childhood, innocence, the, importance, of, imagination, and, racial, theories, all, combined, to, give, an, unprecedented, importance, to, folk, literature, non, classical, mythology, and, children, s, literature, above, all, in, germany, brentano, and, von, arnim, were, significant, literary, figures, who, together, published, des, knaben, wunderhorn, the, boy, s, magic, horn, or, cornucopia, a, collection, of, versified, folk, tales, in, 1806, 1808, the, first, collection, of, grimms, fairy, tales, by, the, brothers, grimm, was, published, in, 1812, unlike, the, much, later, work, of, hans, christian, andersen, who, was, publishing, his, invented, tales, in, danish, from, 1835, these, german, works, were, at, least, mainly, based, on, collected, folk, tales, and, the, grimms, remained, true, to, the, style, of, the, telling, in, their, early, editions, though, later, rewriting, some, parts, one, of, the, brothers, jacob, published, in, 1835, deutsche, mythologie, a, long, academic, work, on, germanic, mythology, another, strain, is, exemplified, by, schiller, s, highly, emotional, language, and, the, depiction, of, physical, violence, in, his, play, the, robbers, of, 1781, in, english, literature, the, key, figures, of, the, romantic, movement, are, considered, to, be, the, group, of, poets, including, william, wordsworth, samuel, taylor, coleridge, john, keats, lord, byron, percy, bysshe, shelley, and, the, much, older, william, blake, followed, later, by, the, isolated, figure, of, john, clare, also, such, novelists, as, walter, scott, from, scotland, and, mary, shelley, and, the, essayists, william, hazlitt, and, charles, lamb, the, publication, in, 1798, of, lyrical, ballads, with, many, of, the, finest, poems, by, wordsworth, and, coleridge, is, often, held, to, mark, the, start, of, the, movement, the, majority, of, the, poems, were, by, wordsworth, and, many, dealt, with, the, lives, of, the, poor, in, his, native, lake, district, or, his, feelings, about, nature, which, he, more, fully, developed, in, his, long, poem, the, prelude, never, published, in, his, lifetime, the, longest, poem, in, the, volume, was, coleridge, s, the, rime, of, the, ancient, mariner, which, showed, the, gothic, side, of, english, romanticism, and, the, exotic, settings, that, many, works, featured, in, the, period, when, they, were, writing, the, lake, poets, were, widely, regarded, as, a, marginal, group, of, radicals, though, they, were, supported, by, the, critic, and, writer, william, hazlitt, and, others, in, contrast, lord, byron, and, walter, scott, achieved, enormous, fame, and, influence, throughout, europe, with, works, exploiting, the, violence, and, drama, of, their, exotic, and, historical, settings, goethe, called, byron, undoubtedly, the, greatest, genius, of, our, century, scott, achieved, immediate, success, with, his, long, narrative, poem, the, lay, of, the, last, minstrel, in, 1805, followed, by, the, full, epic, poem, marmion, in, 1808, both, were, set, in, the, distant, scottish, past, already, evoked, in, ossian, romanticism, and, scotland, were, to, have, a, long, and, fruitful, partnership, byron, had, equal, success, with, the, first, part, of, childe, harold, s, pilgrimage, in, 1812, followed, by, four, turkish, tales, all, in, the, form, of, long, poems, starting, with, the, giaour, in, 1813, drawing, from, his, grand, tour, which, had, reached, ottoman, europe, and, orientalizing, the, themes, of, the, gothic, novel, in, verse, these, featured, different, variations, of, the, byronic, hero, and, his, own, life, contributed, a, further, version, scott, meanwhile, was, effectively, inventing, the, historical, novel, beginning, in, 1814, with, waverley, set, in, the, 1745, jacobite, rising, which, was, a, highly, profitable, success, followed, by, over, 20, further, waverley, novels, over, the, next, 17, years, with, settings, going, back, to, the, crusades, that, he, had, researched, to, a, degree, that, was, new, in, literature, in, contrast, to, germany, romanticism, in, english, literature, had, little, connection, with, nationalism, and, the, romantics, were, often, regarded, with, suspicion, for, the, sympathy, many, felt, for, the, ideals, of, the, french, revolution, whose, collapse, and, replacement, with, the, dictatorship, of, napoleon, was, as, elsewhere, in, europe, a, shock, to, the, movement, though, his, novels, celebrated, scottish, identity, and, history, scott, was, politically, a, firm, unionist, but, admitted, to, jacobite, sympathies, several, romantics, spent, much, time, abroad, and, a, famous, stay, on, lake, geneva, with, byron, and, shelley, in, 1816, produced, the, hugely, influential, novel, frankenstein, by, shelley, s, wife, to, be, mary, shelley, and, the, novella, the, vampyre, by, byron, s, doctor, john, william, polidori, the, lyrics, of, robert, burns, in, scotland, and, thomas, moore, from, ireland, reflected, in, different, ways, their, countries, and, the, romantic, interest, in, folk, literature, but, neither, had, a, fully, romantic, approach, to, life, or, their, work, though, they, have, modern, critical, champions, such, as, gy, rgy, luk, cs, scott, s, novels, are, today, more, likely, to, be, experienced, in, the, form, of, the, many, operas, that, composers, continued, to, base, on, them, over, the, following, decades, such, as, donizetti, s, lucia, di, lammermoor, and, vincenzo, bellini, s, i, puritani, both, 1835, byron, is, now, most, highly, regarded, for, his, short, lyrics, and, his, generally, unromantic, prose, writings, especially, his, letters, and, his, unfinished, satire, don, juan, unlike, many, romantics, byron, s, widely, publicised, personal, life, appeared, to, match, his, work, and, his, death, at, 36, in, 1824, from, disease, when, helping, the, greek, war, of, independence, appeared, from, a, distance, to, be, a, suitably, romantic, end, entrenching, his, legend, keats, in, 1821, and, shelley, in, 1822, both, died, in, italy, blake, at, almost, 70, in, 1827, and, coleridge, largely, ceased, to, write, in, the, 1820s, wordsworth, was, by, 1820, respectable, and, highly, regarded, holding, a, government, sinecure, but, wrote, relatively, little, in, the, discussion, of, english, literature, the, romantic, period, is, often, regarded, as, finishing, around, the, 1820s, or, sometimes, even, earlier, although, many, authors, of, the, succeeding, decades, were, no, less, committed, to, romantic, values, the, most, significant, novelist, in, english, during, the, peak, romantic, period, other, than, walter, scott, was, jane, austen, whose, essentially, conservative, world, view, had, little, in, common, with, her, romantic, contemporaries, retaining, a, strong, belief, in, decorum, and, social, rules, though, critics, such, as, claudia, l, johnson, have, detected, tremors, under, the, surface, of, many, works, such, as, northanger, abbey, 1817, mansfield, park, 1814, and, persuasion, 1817, but, around, the, mid, century, the, undoubtedly, romantic, novels, of, the, yorkshire, based, bront, family, appeared, most, notably, charlotte, s, jane, eyre, and, emily, s, wuthering, heights, both, published, in, 1847, which, also, introduced, more, gothic, themes, while, these, two, novels, were, written, and, published, after, the, romantic, period, is, said, to, have, ended, their, novels, were, heavily, influenced, by, romantic, literature, they, had, read, as, children, byron, keats, and, shelley, all, wrote, for, the, stage, but, with, little, success, in, england, with, shelley, s, the, cenci, perhaps, the, best, work, produced, though, that, was, not, played, in, a, public, theatre, in, england, until, a, century, after, his, death, byron, s, plays, along, with, dramatizations, of, his, poems, and, scott, s, novels, were, much, more, popular, on, the, continent, and, especially, in, france, and, through, these, versions, several, were, turned, into, operas, many, still, performed, today, if, contemporary, poets, had, little, success, on, the, stage, the, period, was, a, legendary, one, for, performances, of, shakespeare, and, went, some, way, to, restoring, his, original, texts, and, removing, the, augustan, improvements, to, them, the, greatest, actor, of, the, period, edmund, kean, restored, the, tragic, ending, to, king, lear, coleridge, said, that, seeing, him, act, was, like, reading, shakespeare, by, flashes, of, lightning, although, after, union, with, england, in, 1707, scotland, increasingly, adopted, english, language, and, wider, cultural, norms, its, literature, developed, a, distinct, national, identity, and, began, to, enjoy, an, international, reputation, allan, ramsay, 1686, 1758, laid, the, foundations, of, a, reawakening, of, interest, in, older, scottish, literature, as, well, as, leading, the, trend, for, pastoral, poetry, helping, to, develop, the, habbie, stanza, as, a, poetic, form, james, macpherson, 1736, 1796, was, the, first, scottish, poet, to, gain, an, international, reputation, claiming, to, have, found, poetry, written, by, the, ancient, bard, ossian, he, published, translations, that, acquired, international, popularity, being, proclaimed, as, a, celtic, equivalent, of, the, classical, epics, fingal, written, in, 1762, was, speedily, translated, into, many, european, languages, and, its, appreciation, of, natural, beauty, and, treatment, of, the, ancient, legend, has, been, credited, more, than, any, single, work, with, bringing, about, the, romantic, movement, in, european, and, especially, in, german, literature, through, its, influence, on, johann, gottfried, von, herder, and, johann, wolfgang, von, goethe, it, was, also, popularised, in, france, by, figures, that, included, napoleon, eventually, it, became, clear, that, the, poems, were, not, direct, translations, from, scottish, gaelic, but, flowery, adaptations, made, to, suit, the, aesthetic, expectations, of, his, audience, robert, burns, 1759, 96, and, walter, scott, 1771, 1832, were, highly, influenced, by, the, ossian, cycle, burns, an, ayrshire, poet, and, lyricist, is, widely, regarded, as, the, national, poet, of, scotland, and, a, major, influence, on, the, romantic, movement, his, poem, and, song, auld, lang, syne, is, often, sung, at, hogmanay, the, last, day, of, the, year, and, scots, wha, hae, served, for, a, long, time, as, an, unofficial, national, anthem, of, the, country, scott, began, as, a, poet, and, also, collected, and, published, scottish, ballads, his, first, prose, work, waverley, in, 1814, is, often, called, the, first, historical, novel, it, launched, a, highly, successful, career, with, other, historical, novels, such, as, rob, roy, 1817, the, heart, of, midlothian, 1818, and, ivanhoe, 1820, scott, probably, did, more, than, any, other, figure, to, define, and, popularise, scottish, cultural, identity, in, the, nineteenth, century, other, major, literary, figures, connected, with, romanticism, include, the, poets, and, novelists, james, hogg, 1770, 1835, allan, cunningham, 1784, 1842, and, john, galt, 1779, 1839, scotland, was, also, the, location, of, two, of, the, most, important, literary, magazines, of, the, era, the, edinburgh, review, founded, in, 1802, and, blackwood, s, magazine, founded, in, 1817, which, had, a, major, impact, on, the, development, of, british, literature, and, drama, in, the, era, of, romanticism, ian, duncan, and, alex, benchimol, suggest, that, publications, like, the, novels, of, scott, and, these, magazines, were, part, of, a, highly, dynamic, scottish, romanticism, that, by, the, early, nineteenth, century, caused, edinburgh, to, emerge, as, the, cultural, capital, of, britain, and, become, central, to, a, wider, formation, of, a, british, isles, nationalism, scottish, national, drama, emerged, in, the, early, 1800s, as, plays, with, specifically, scottish, themes, began, to, dominate, the, scottish, stage, theatres, had, been, discouraged, by, the, church, of, scotland, and, fears, of, jacobite, assemblies, in, the, later, eighteenth, century, many, plays, were, written, for, and, performed, by, small, amateur, companies, and, were, not, published, and, so, most, have, been, lost, towards, the, end, of, the, century, there, were, closet, dramas, primarily, designed, to, be, read, rather, than, performed, including, work, by, scott, hogg, galt, and, joanna, baillie, 1762, 1851, often, influenced, by, the, ballad, tradition, and, gothic, romanticism, romanticism, was, relatively, late, in, developing, in, french, literature, more, so, than, in, the, visual, arts, the, 18th, century, precursor, to, romanticism, the, cult, of, sensibility, had, become, associated, with, the, ancien, r, gime, and, the, french, revolution, had, been, more, of, an, inspiration, to, foreign, writers, than, those, experiencing, it, at, first, hand, the, first, major, figure, was, fran, ois, ren, de, chateaubriand, an, aristocrat, who, had, remained, a, royalist, throughout, the, revolution, and, returned, to, france, from, exile, in, england, and, america, under, napoleon, with, whose, regime, he, had, an, uneasy, relationship, his, writings, all, in, prose, included, some, fiction, such, as, his, influential, novella, of, exile, ren, 1802, which, anticipated, byron, in, its, alienated, hero, but, mostly, contemporary, history, and, politics, his, travels, a, defence, of, religion, and, the, medieval, spirit, g, nie, du, christianisme, 1802, and, finally, in, the, 1830s, and, 1840s, his, enormous, autobiography, m, moires, d, outre, tombe, memoirs, from, beyond, the, grave, after, the, bourbon, restoration, french, romanticism, developed, in, the, lively, world, of, parisian, theatre, with, productions, of, shakespeare, schiller, in, france, a, key, romantic, author, and, adaptations, of, scott, and, byron, alongside, french, authors, several, of, whom, began, to, write, in, the, late, 1820s, cliques, of, pro, and, anti, romantics, developed, and, productions, were, often, accompanied, by, raucous, vocalizing, by, the, two, sides, including, the, shouted, assertion, by, one, theatregoer, in, 1822, that, shakespeare, c, est, l, aide, de, camp, de, wellington, shakespeare, is, wellington, s, aide, de, camp, alexandre, dumas, began, as, a, dramatist, with, a, series, of, successes, beginning, with, henri, iii, et, sa, cour, 1829, before, turning, to, novels, that, were, mostly, historical, adventures, somewhat, in, the, manner, of, scott, most, famously, the, three, musketeers, and, the, count, of, monte, cristo, both, of, 1844, victor, hugo, published, as, a, poet, in, the, 1820s, before, achieving, success, on, the, stage, with, hernani, a, historical, drama, in, a, quasi, shakespearean, style, that, had, famously, riotous, performances, on, its, first, run, in, 1830, like, dumas, hugo, is, best, known, for, his, novels, and, was, already, writing, the, hunchback, of, notre, dame, 1831, one, of, the, best, known, works, which, became, a, paradigm, of, the, french, romantic, movement, the, preface, to, his, unperformed, play, cromwell, gives, an, important, manifesto, of, french, romanticism, stating, that, there, are, no, rules, or, models, the, career, of, prosper, m, rim, e, followed, a, similar, pattern, he, is, now, best, known, as, the, originator, of, the, story, of, carmen, with, his, novella, published, 1845, alfred, de, vigny, remains, best, known, as, a, dramatist, with, his, play, on, the, life, of, the, english, poet, chatterton, 1835, perhaps, his, best, work, george, sand, was, a, central, figure, of, the, parisian, literary, scene, famous, both, for, her, novels, and, criticism, and, her, affairs, with, chopin, and, several, others, she, too, was, inspired, by, the, theatre, and, wrote, works, to, be, staged, at, her, private, estate, french, romantic, poets, of, the, 1830s, to, 1850s, include, alfred, de, musset, g, rard, de, nerval, alphonse, de, lamartine, and, the, flamboyant, th, ophile, gautier, whose, prolific, output, in, various, forms, continued, until, his, death, in, 1872, stendhal, is, today, probably, the, most, highly, regarded, french, novelist, of, the, period, but, he, stands, in, a, complex, relation, with, romanticism, and, is, notable, for, his, penetrating, psychological, insight, into, his, characters, and, his, realism, qualities, rarely, prominent, in, romantic, fiction, as, a, survivor, of, the, french, retreat, from, moscow, in, 1812, fantasies, of, heroism, and, adventure, had, little, appeal, for, him, and, like, goya, he, is, often, seen, as, a, forerunner, of, realism, his, most, important, works, are, le, rouge, et, le, noir, the, red, and, the, black, 1830, and, la, chartreuse, de, parme, the, charterhouse, of, parma, 1839, romanticism, in, poland, is, often, taken, to, begin, with, the, publication, of, adam, mickiewicz, s, first, poems, in, 1822, and, end, with, the, crushing, of, the, january, uprising, of, 1863, against, the, russians, it, was, strongly, marked, by, interest, in, polish, history, polish, romanticism, revived, the, old, sarmatism, traditions, of, the, szlachta, or, polish, nobility, old, traditions, and, customs, were, revived, and, portrayed, in, a, positive, light, in, the, polish, messianic, movement, and, in, works, of, great, polish, poets, such, as, adam, mickiewicz, pan, tadeusz, juliusz, s, owacki, and, zygmunt, krasi, ski, this, close, connection, between, polish, romanticism, and, polish, history, became, one, of, the, defining, qualities, of, the, literature, of, polish, romanticism, period, differentiating, it, from, that, of, other, countries, they, had, not, suffered, the, loss, of, national, statehood, as, was, the, case, with, poland, influenced, by, the, general, spirit, and, main, ideas, of, european, romanticism, the, literature, of, polish, romanticism, is, unique, as, many, scholars, have, pointed, out, in, having, developed, largely, outside, of, poland, and, in, its, emphatic, focus, upon, the, issue, of, polish, nationalism, the, polish, intelligentsia, along, with, leading, members, of, its, government, left, poland, in, the, early, 1830s, during, what, is, referred, to, as, the, great, emigration, resettling, in, france, germany, great, britain, turkey, and, the, united, states, their, art, featured, emotionalism, and, irrationality, fantasy, and, imagination, personality, cults, folklore, and, country, life, and, the, propagation, of, ideals, of, freedom, in, the, second, period, many, of, the, polish, romantics, worked, abroad, often, banished, from, poland, by, the, occupying, powers, due, to, their, politically, subversive, ideas, their, work, became, increasingly, dominated, by, the, ideals, of, political, struggle, for, freedom, and, their, country, s, sovereignty, elements, of, mysticism, became, more, prominent, there, developed, the, idea, of, the, poeta, wieszcz, the, prophet, the, wieszcz, bard, functioned, as, spiritual, leader, to, the, nation, fighting, for, its, independence, the, most, notable, poet, so, recognized, was, adam, mickiewicz, zygmunt, krasi, ski, also, wrote, to, inspire, political, and, religious, hope, in, his, countrymen, unlike, his, predecessors, who, called, for, victory, at, whatever, price, in, poland, s, struggle, against, russia, krasinski, emphasized, poland, s, spiritual, role, in, its, fight, for, independence, advocating, an, intellectual, rather, than, a, military, superiority, his, works, best, exemplify, the, messianic, movement, in, poland, in, two, early, dramas, nie, boska, komedia, 1835, the, undivine, comedy, and, irydion, 1836, iridion, as, well, as, in, the, later, psalmy, przysz, o, ci, 1845, he, asserted, that, poland, was, the, christ, of, europe, specifically, chosen, by, god, to, carry, the, world, s, burdens, to, suffer, and, eventually, be, resurrected, early, russian, romanticism, is, associated, with, the, writers, konstantin, batyushkov, a, vision, on, the, shores, of, the, lethe, 1809, vasily, zhukovsky, the, bard, 1811, svetlana, 1813, and, nikolay, karamzin, poor, liza, 1792, julia, 1796, martha, the, mayoress, 1802, the, sensitive, and, the, cold, 1803, however, the, principal, exponent, of, romanticism, in, russia, is, alexander, pushkin, the, prisoner, of, the, caucasus, 1820, 1821, the, robber, brothers, 1822, ruslan, and, ludmila, 1820, eugene, onegin, 1825, 1832, pushkin, s, work, influenced, many, writers, in, the, 19th, century, and, led, to, his, eventual, recognition, as, russia, s, greatest, poet, other, russian, romantic, poets, include, mikhail, lermontov, a, hero, of, our, time, 1839, fyodor, tyutchev, silentium, 1830, yevgeny, baratynsky, eda, 1826, anton, delvig, and, wilhelm, k, chelbecker, influenced, heavily, by, lord, byron, lermontov, sought, to, explore, the, romantic, emphasis, on, metaphysical, discontent, with, society, and, self, while, tyutchev, s, poems, often, described, scenes, of, nature, or, passions, of, love, tyutchev, commonly, operated, with, such, categories, as, night, and, day, north, and, south, dream, and, reality, cosmos, and, chaos, and, the, still, world, of, winter, and, spring, teeming, with, life, baratynsky, s, style, was, fairly, classical, in, nature, dwelling, on, the, models, of, the, previous, century, romanticism, in, spanish, literature, developed, a, well, known, literature, with, a, huge, variety, of, poets, and, playwrights, the, most, important, spanish, poet, during, this, movement, was, jos, de, espronceda, after, him, there, were, other, poets, like, gustavo, adolfo, b, cquer, mariano, jos, de, larra, and, the, dramatists, ngel, de, saavedra, and, jos, zorrilla, author, of, don, juan, tenorio, before, them, may, be, mentioned, the, pre, romantics, jos, cadalso, and, manuel, jos, quintana, the, plays, of, antonio, garc, a, guti, rrez, were, adapted, to, produce, giuseppe, verdi, s, operas, il, trovatore, and, simon, boccanegra, spanish, romanticism, also, influenced, regional, literatures, for, example, in, catalonia, and, in, galicia, there, was, a, national, boom, of, writers, in, the, local, languages, like, the, catalan, jacint, verdaguer, and, the, galician, rosal, a, de, castro, the, main, figures, of, the, national, revivalist, movements, renaixen, a, and, rexurdimento, respectively, there, are, scholars, who, consider, spanish, romanticism, to, be, proto, existentialism, because, it, is, more, anguished, than, the, movement, in, other, european, countries, foster, et, al, for, example, say, that, the, work, of, spain, s, writers, such, as, espronceda, larra, and, other, writers, in, the, 19th, century, demonstrated, a, metaphysical, crisis, these, observers, put, more, weight, on, the, link, between, the, 19th, century, spanish, writers, with, the, existentialist, movement, that, emerged, immediately, after, according, to, richard, caldwell, the, writers, that, we, now, identify, with, spain, s, romanticism, were, actually, precursors, to, those, who, galvanized, the, literary, movement, that, emerged, in, the, 1920s, this, notion, is, the, subject, of, debate, for, there, are, authors, who, stress, that, spain, s, romanticism, is, one, of, the, earliest, in, europe, while, some, assert, that, spain, really, had, no, period, of, literary, romanticism, this, controversy, underscores, a, certain, uniqueness, to, spanish, romanticism, in, comparison, to, its, european, counterparts, romanticism, began, in, portugal, with, the, publication, of, the, poem, cam, es, 1825, by, almeida, garrett, who, was, raised, by, his, uncle, d, alexandre, bishop, of, angra, in, the, precepts, of, neoclassicism, which, can, be, observed, in, his, early, work, the, author, himself, confesses, in, cam, es, preface, that, he, voluntarily, refused, to, follow, the, principles, of, epic, poetry, enunciated, by, aristotle, in, his, poetics, as, he, did, the, same, to, horace, s, ars, poetica, almeida, garrett, had, participated, in, the, 1820, liberal, revolution, which, caused, him, to, exile, himself, in, england, in, 1823, and, then, in, france, after, the, vila, francada, while, living, in, great, britain, he, had, contacts, with, the, romantic, movement, and, read, authors, such, as, shakespeare, scott, ossian, byron, hugo, lamartine, and, de, sta, l, at, the, same, time, visiting, feudal, castles, and, ruins, of, gothic, churches, and, abbeys, which, would, be, reflected, in, his, writings, in, 1838, he, presented, um, auto, de, gil, vicente, a, play, by, gil, vicente, in, an, attempt, to, create, a, new, national, theatre, free, of, greco, roman, and, foreign, influence, but, his, masterpiece, would, be, frei, lu, s, de, sousa, 1843, named, by, himself, as, a, romantic, drama, and, it, was, acclaimed, as, an, exceptional, work, dealing, with, themes, as, national, independence, faith, justice, and, love, he, was, also, deeply, interested, in, portuguese, folkloric, verse, which, resulted, in, the, publication, of, romanceiro, traditional, portuguese, ballads, 1843, that, recollect, a, great, number, of, ancient, popular, ballads, known, as, romances, or, rimances, in, redondilha, maior, verse, form, that, contained, stories, of, chivalry, life, of, saints, crusades, courtly, love, etc, he, wrote, the, novels, viagens, na, minha, terra, o, arco, de, sant, ana, and, helena, alexandre, herculano, is, alongside, almeida, garrett, one, of, the, founders, of, portuguese, romanticism, he, too, was, forced, to, exile, to, great, britain, and, france, because, of, his, liberal, ideals, all, of, his, poetry, and, prose, are, unlike, almeida, garrett, s, entirely, romantic, rejecting, greco, roman, myth, and, history, he, sought, inspiration, in, medieval, portuguese, poems, and, chronicles, as, in, the, bible, his, output, is, vast, and, covers, many, different, genres, such, as, historical, essays, poetry, novels, opuscules, and, theatre, where, he, brings, back, a, whole, world, of, portuguese, legends, tradition, and, history, especially, in, eurico, o, presb, tero, eurico, the, priest, and, lendas, e, narrativas, legends, and, narratives, his, work, was, influenced, by, chateaubriand, schiller, klopstock, walter, scott, and, the, old, testament, psalms, ant, nio, feliciano, de, castilho, made, the, case, for, ultra, romanticism, publishing, the, poems, a, noite, no, castelo, night, in, the, castle, and, os, ci, mes, do, bardo, the, jealousy, of, the, bard, both, in, 1836, and, the, drama, cam, es, he, became, an, unquestionable, master, for, successive, ultra, romantic, generations, whose, influence, would, not, be, challenged, until, the, famous, coimbra, question, he, also, created, polemics, by, translating, goethe, s, faust, without, knowing, german, but, using, french, versions, of, the, play, other, notable, figures, of, portuguese, romanticism, are, the, famous, novelists, camilo, castelo, branco, and, j, lio, dinis, and, soares, de, passos, bulh, o, pato, and, pinheiro, chagas, romantic, style, would, be, revived, in, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, notably, through, the, works, of, poets, linked, to, the, portuguese, renaissance, such, as, teixeira, de, pascoais, jaime, cortes, o, m, rio, beir, o, among, others, who, can, be, considered, neo, romantics, an, early, portuguese, expression, of, romanticism, is, found, already, in, poets, such, as, manuel, maria, barbosa, du, bocage, especially, in, his, sonnets, dated, at, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, and, leonor, de, almeida, portugal, marquise, of, alorna, romanticism, in, italian, literature, was, a, minor, movement, although, some, important, works, were, produced, it, began, officially, in, 1816, when, germaine, de, sta, l, wrote, an, article, in, the, journal, biblioteca, italiana, called, sulla, maniera, e, l, utilit, delle, traduzioni, inviting, italian, people, to, reject, neoclassicism, and, to, study, new, authors, from, other, countries, before, that, date, ugo, foscolo, had, already, published, poems, anticipating, romantic, themes, the, most, important, romantic, writers, were, ludovico, di, breme, pietro, borsieri, and, giovanni, berchet, better, known, authors, such, as, alessandro, manzoni, and, giacomo, leopardi, were, influenced, by, enlightenment, as, well, as, by, romanticism, and, classicism, an, italian, romanticist, writer, who, produced, works, in, various, genres, including, short, stories, and, novels, such, as, ricciarda, o, i, nurra, e, i, cabras, was, the, piedmontese, giuseppe, botero, 1815, 1885, devoting, much, of, his, career, to, sardinian, literature, spanish, speaking, south, american, romanticism, was, influenced, heavily, by, esteban, echeverr, a, who, wrote, in, the, 1830s, and, 1840s, his, writings, were, influenced, by, his, hatred, for, the, argentine, dictator, juan, manuel, de, rosas, and, filled, with, themes, of, blood, and, terror, using, the, metaphor, of, a, slaughterhouse, to, portray, the, violence, of, rosas, dictatorship, brazilian, romanticism, is, characterized, and, divided, in, three, different, periods, the, first, one, is, basically, focused, on, the, creation, of, a, sense, of, national, identity, using, the, ideal, of, the, heroic, indian, some, examples, include, jos, de, alencar, who, wrote, iracema, and, o, guarani, and, gon, alves, dias, renowned, by, the, poem, can, o, do, ex, lio, song, of, the, exile, the, second, period, sometimes, called, ultra, romanticism, is, marked, by, a, profound, influence, of, european, themes, and, traditions, involving, the, melancholy, sadness, and, despair, related, to, unobtainable, love, goethe, and, lord, byron, are, commonly, quoted, in, these, works, some, of, the, most, notable, authors, of, this, phase, are, lvares, de, azevedo, casimiro, de, abreu, fagundes, varela, and, junqueira, freire, the, third, cycle, is, marked, by, social, poetry, especially, the, abolitionist, movement, and, it, includes, castro, alves, tobias, barreto, and, pedro, lu, s, pereira, de, sousa, in, the, united, states, at, least, by, 1818, with, william, cullen, bryant, s, to, a, waterfowl, romantic, poetry, was, being, published, american, romantic, gothic, literature, made, an, early, appearance, with, washington, irving, s, the, legend, of, sleepy, hollow, 1820, and, rip, van, winkle, 1819, followed, from, 1823, onwards, by, the, leatherstocking, tales, of, james, fenimore, cooper, with, their, emphasis, on, heroic, simplicity, and, their, fervent, landscape, descriptions, of, an, already, exotic, mythicized, frontier, peopled, by, noble, savages, similar, to, the, philosophical, theory, of, rousseau, exemplified, by, uncas, from, the, last, of, the, mohicans, there, are, picturesque, local, colour, elements, in, washington, irving, s, essays, and, especially, his, travel, books, edgar, allan, poe, s, tales, of, the, macabre, and, his, balladic, poetry, were, more, influential, in, france, than, at, home, but, the, romantic, american, novel, developed, fully, with, the, atmosphere, and, drama, of, nathaniel, hawthorne, s, the, scarlet, letter, 1850, later, transcendentalist, writers, such, as, henry, david, thoreau, and, ralph, waldo, emerson, still, show, elements, of, its, influence, and, imagination, as, does, the, romantic, realism, of, walt, whitman, the, poetry, of, emily, dickinson, nearly, unread, in, her, own, time, and, herman, melville, s, novel, moby, dick, can, be, taken, as, epitomes, of, american, romantic, literature, by, the, 1880s, however, psychological, and, social, realism, were, competing, with, romanticism, in, the, novel, the, european, romantic, movement, reached, america, in, the, early, 19th, century, american, romanticism, was, just, as, multifaceted, and, individualistic, as, it, was, in, europe, like, the, europeans, the, american, romantics, demonstrated, a, high, level, of, moral, enthusiasm, commitment, to, individualism, and, the, unfolding, of, the, self, an, emphasis, on, intuitive, perception, and, the, assumption, that, the, natural, world, was, inherently, good, while, human, society, was, filled, with, corruption, romanticism, became, popular, in, american, politics, philosophy, and, art, the, movement, appealed, to, the, revolutionary, spirit, of, america, as, well, as, to, those, longing, to, break, free, of, the, strict, religious, traditions, of, early, settlement, the, romantics, rejected, rationalism, and, religious, intellect, it, appealed, to, those, in, opposition, of, calvinism, which, includes, the, belief, that, the, destiny, of, each, individual, is, preordained, the, romantic, movement, gave, rise, to, new, england, transcendentalism, which, portrayed, a, less, restrictive, relationship, between, god, and, universe, the, new, philosophy, presented, the, individual, with, a, more, personal, relationship, with, god, transcendentalism, and, romanticism, appealed, to, americans, in, a, similar, fashion, for, both, privileged, feeling, over, reason, individual, freedom, of, expression, over, the, restraints, of, tradition, and, custom, it, often, involved, a, rapturous, response, to, nature, it, encouraged, the, rejection, of, harsh, rigid, calvinism, and, promised, a, new, blossoming, of, american, culture, american, romanticism, embraced, the, individual, and, rebelled, against, the, confinement, of, neoclassicism, and, religious, tradition, the, romantic, movement, in, america, created, a, new, literary, genre, that, continues, to, influence, american, writers, novels, short, stories, and, poems, replaced, the, sermons, and, manifestos, of, yore, romantic, literature, was, personal, intense, and, portrayed, more, emotion, than, ever, seen, in, neoclassical, literature, america, s, preoccupation, with, freedom, became, a, great, source, of, motivation, for, romantic, writers, as, many, were, delighted, in, free, expression, and, emotion, without, so, much, fear, of, ridicule, and, controversy, they, also, put, more, effort, into, the, psychological, development, of, their, characters, and, the, main, characters, typically, displayed, extremes, of, sensitivity, and, excitement, the, works, of, the, romantic, era, also, differed, from, preceding, works, in, that, they, spoke, to, a, wider, audience, partly, reflecting, the, greater, distribution, of, books, as, costs, came, down, during, the, period, romantic, architecture, appeared, in, the, late, 18th, century, in, a, reaction, against, the, rigid, forms, of, neoclassical, architecture, romantic, architecture, reached, its, peak, in, the, mid, 19th, century, and, continued, to, appear, until, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, it, was, designed, to, evoke, an, emotional, reaction, either, respect, for, tradition, or, nostalgia, for, a, bucolic, past, it, was, frequently, inspired, by, the, architecture, of, the, middle, ages, especially, gothic, architecture, it, was, strongly, influenced, by, romanticism, in, literature, particularly, the, historical, novels, of, victor, hugo, and, walter, scott, it, sometimes, moved, into, the, domain, of, eclecticism, with, features, assembled, from, different, historic, periods, and, regions, of, the, world, gothic, revival, architecture, was, a, popular, variant, of, the, romantic, style, particularly, in, the, construction, of, churches, cathedrals, and, university, buildings, notable, examples, include, the, completion, of, cologne, cathedral, in, germany, by, karl, friedrich, schinkel, the, cathedral, s, construction, began, in, 1248, but, was, halted, in, 1473, the, original, plans, for, the, fa, ade, were, discovered, in, 1840, and, it, was, decided, to, recommence, schinkel, followed, the, original, design, as, much, as, possible, but, he, also, used, modern, construction, technology, including, an, iron, frame, for, the, roof, the, building, was, finished, in, 1880, in, britain, notable, examples, include, the, royal, pavilion, in, brighton, a, romantic, version, of, traditional, indian, architecture, by, john, nash, 1815, 1823, and, the, houses, of, parliament, in, london, built, in, a, gothic, revival, style, by, charles, barry, between, 1840, and, 1876, in, france, one, of, the, earliest, examples, of, romantic, architecture, is, the, hameau, de, la, reine, the, small, rustic, hamlet, created, at, the, palace, of, versailles, for, queen, marie, antoinette, between, 1783, and, 1785, by, the, royal, architect, richard, mique, with, the, help, of, the, romantic, painter, hubert, robert, it, consisted, of, twelve, structures, ten, of, which, still, exist, in, the, style, of, villages, in, normandy, it, was, designed, for, the, queen, and, her, friends, to, amuse, themselves, by, playing, at, being, peasants, and, included, a, farmhouse, with, a, dairy, a, mill, a, boudoir, a, pigeon, loft, a, tower, in, the, form, of, a, lighthouse, from, which, one, could, fish, in, the, pond, a, belvedere, a, cascade, and, grotto, and, a, luxuriously, furnished, cottage, with, a, billiard, room, for, the, queen, french, romantic, architecture, in, the, 19th, century, was, strongly, influenced, by, two, writers, victor, hugo, whose, novel, the, hunchback, of, notre, dame, inspired, a, resurgence, in, interest, in, the, middle, ages, and, prosper, m, rim, e, who, wrote, celebrated, romantic, novels, and, short, stories, and, was, also, the, first, head, of, the, commission, of, historic, monuments, in, france, responsible, for, publicizing, and, restoring, and, sometimes, romanticizing, many, french, cathedrals, and, monuments, desecrated, and, ruined, after, the, french, revolution, his, projects, were, carried, out, by, the, architect, eug, ne, viollet, le, duc, these, included, the, restoration, sometimes, creative, of, the, cathedral, of, notre, dame, de, paris, the, fortified, city, of, carcassonne, and, the, unfinished, medieval, ch, teau, de, pierrefonds, the, romantic, style, continued, in, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, the, palais, garnier, the, paris, opera, house, designed, by, charles, garnier, was, a, highly, romantic, and, eclectic, combination, of, artistic, styles, another, notable, example, of, late, 19th, century, romanticism, is, the, basilica, of, sacr, c, ur, by, paul, abadie, who, drew, upon, the, model, of, byzantine, architecture, for, his, elongated, domes, 1875, 1914, in, the, visual, arts, romanticism, first, showed, itself, in, landscape, painting, where, from, as, early, as, the, 1760s, british, artists, began, to, turn, to, wilder, landscapes, and, storms, and, gothic, architecture, even, if, they, had, to, make, do, with, wales, as, a, setting, caspar, david, friedrich, and, j, m, w, turner, were, born, less, than, a, year, apart, in, 1774, and, 1775, respectively, and, were, to, take, german, and, english, landscape, painting, to, their, extremes, of, romanticism, but, both, their, artistic, sensibilities, were, formed, when, forms, of, romanticism, was, already, strongly, present, in, art, john, constable, born, in, 1776, stayed, closer, to, the, english, landscape, tradition, but, in, his, largest, six, footers, insisted, on, the, heroic, status, of, a, patch, of, the, working, countryside, where, he, had, grown, up, challenging, the, traditional, hierarchy, of, genres, which, relegated, landscape, painting, to, a, low, status, turner, also, painted, very, large, landscapes, and, above, all, seascapes, some, of, these, large, paintings, had, contemporary, settings, and, staffage, but, others, had, small, figures, that, turned, the, work, into, history, painting, in, the, manner, of, claude, lorrain, like, salvator, rosa, a, late, baroque, artist, whose, landscapes, had, elements, that, romantic, painters, repeatedly, turned, to, friedrich, often, used, single, figures, or, features, like, crosses, set, alone, amidst, a, huge, landscape, making, them, images, of, the, transitoriness, of, human, life, and, the, premonition, of, death, other, groups, of, artists, expressed, feelings, that, verged, on, the, mystical, many, largely, abandoning, classical, drawing, and, proportions, these, included, william, blake, and, samuel, palmer, and, the, other, members, of, the, ancients, in, england, and, in, germany, philipp, otto, runge, like, friedrich, none, of, these, artists, had, significant, influence, after, their, deaths, for, the, rest, of, the, 19th, century, and, were, 20th, century, rediscoveries, from, obscurity, though, blake, was, always, known, as, a, poet, and, norway, s, leading, painter, johan, christian, dahl, was, heavily, influenced, by, friedrich, the, rome, based, nazarene, movement, of, german, artists, active, from, 1810, took, a, very, different, path, concentrating, on, medievalizing, history, paintings, with, religious, and, nationalist, themes, the, arrival, of, romanticism, in, french, art, was, delayed, by, the, strong, hold, of, neoclassicism, on, the, academies, but, from, the, napoleonic, period, it, became, increasingly, popular, initially, in, the, form, of, history, paintings, propagandising, for, the, new, regime, of, which, girodet, s, ossian, receiving, the, ghosts, of, the, french, heroes, for, napoleon, s, ch, teau, de, malmaison, was, one, of, the, earliest, girodet, s, old, teacher, david, was, puzzled, and, disappointed, by, his, pupil, s, direction, saying, either, girodet, is, mad, or, i, no, longer, know, anything, of, the, art, of, painting, a, new, generation, of, the, french, school, developed, personal, romantic, styles, though, still, concentrating, on, history, painting, with, a, political, message, th, odore, g, ricault, 1791, 1824, had, his, first, success, with, the, charging, chasseur, a, heroic, military, figure, derived, from, rubens, at, the, paris, salon, of, 1812, in, the, years, of, the, empire, but, his, next, major, completed, work, the, raft, of, the, medusa, of, 1818, 19, remains, the, greatest, achievement, of, the, romantic, history, painting, which, in, its, day, had, a, powerful, anti, government, message, eug, ne, delacroix, 1798, 1863, made, his, first, salon, hits, with, the, barque, of, dante, 1822, the, massacre, at, chios, 1824, and, death, of, sardanapalus, 1827, the, second, was, a, scene, from, the, greek, war, of, independence, completed, the, year, byron, died, there, and, the, last, was, a, scene, from, one, of, byron, s, plays, with, shakespeare, byron, was, to, provide, the, subject, matter, for, many, other, works, of, delacroix, who, also, spent, long, periods, in, north, africa, painting, colourful, scenes, of, mounted, arab, warriors, his, liberty, leading, the, people, 1830, remains, with, the, medusa, one, of, the, best, known, works, of, french, romantic, painting, both, reflected, current, events, and, increasingly, history, painting, literally, story, painting, a, phrase, dating, back, to, the, italian, renaissance, meaning, the, painting, of, subjects, with, groups, of, figures, long, considered, the, highest, and, most, difficult, form, of, art, did, indeed, become, the, painting, of, historical, scenes, rather, than, those, from, religion, or, mythology, francisco, goya, was, called, the, last, great, painter, in, whose, art, thought, and, observation, were, balanced, and, combined, to, form, a, faultless, unity, but, the, extent, to, which, he, was, a, romantic, is, a, complex, question, in, spain, there, was, still, a, struggle, to, introduce, the, values, of, the, enlightenment, in, which, goya, saw, himself, as, a, participant, the, demonic, and, anti, rational, monsters, thrown, up, by, his, imagination, are, only, superficially, similar, to, those, of, the, gothic, fantasies, of, northern, europe, and, in, many, ways, he, remained, wedded, to, the, classicism, and, realism, of, his, training, as, well, as, looking, forward, to, the, realism, of, the, later, 19th, century, but, he, more, than, any, other, artist, of, the, period, exemplified, the, romantic, values, of, the, expression, of, the, artist, s, feelings, and, his, personal, imaginative, world, he, also, shared, with, many, of, the, romantic, painters, a, more, free, handling, of, paint, emphasized, in, the, new, prominence, of, the, brushstroke, and, impasto, which, tended, to, be, repressed, in, neoclassicism, under, a, self, effacing, finish, sculpture, remained, largely, impervious, to, romanticism, probably, partly, for, technical, reasons, as, the, most, prestigious, material, of, the, day, marble, does, not, lend, itself, to, expansive, gestures, the, leading, sculptors, in, europe, antonio, canova, and, bertel, thorvaldsen, were, both, based, in, rome, and, firm, neoclassicists, not, at, all, tempted, to, allow, influence, from, medieval, sculpture, which, would, have, been, one, possible, approach, to, romantic, sculpture, when, it, did, develop, true, romantic, sculpture, with, the, exception, of, a, few, artists, such, as, rudolf, maison, rather, oddly, was, missing, in, germany, and, mainly, found, in, france, with, fran, ois, rude, best, known, from, his, group, of, the, 1830s, from, the, arc, de, triomphe, in, paris, david, d, angers, and, auguste, pr, ault, pr, ault, s, plaster, relief, entitled, slaughter, which, represented, the, horrors, of, wars, with, exacerbated, passion, caused, so, much, scandal, at, the, 1834, salon, that, pr, ault, was, banned, from, this, official, annual, exhibition, for, nearly, twenty, years, in, italy, the, most, important, romantic, sculptor, was, lorenzo, bartolini, in, france, historical, painting, on, idealized, medieval, and, renaissance, themes, is, known, as, the, style, troubadour, a, term, with, no, equivalent, for, other, countries, though, the, same, trends, occurred, there, delacroix, ingres, and, richard, parkes, bonington, all, worked, in, this, style, as, did, lesser, specialists, such, as, pierre, henri, r, voil, 1776, 1842, and, fleury, fran, ois, richard, 1777, 1852, their, pictures, are, often, small, and, feature, intimate, private, and, anecdotal, moments, as, well, as, those, of, high, drama, the, lives, of, great, artists, such, as, raphael, were, commemorated, on, equal, terms, with, those, of, rulers, and, fictional, characters, were, also, depicted, fleury, richard, s, valentine, of, milan, weeping, for, the, death, of, her, husband, shown, in, the, paris, salon, of, 1802, marked, the, arrival, of, the, style, which, lasted, until, the, mid, century, before, being, subsumed, into, the, increasingly, academic, history, painting, of, artists, like, paul, delaroche, another, trend, was, for, very, large, apocalyptic, history, paintings, often, combining, extreme, natural, events, or, divine, wrath, with, human, disaster, attempting, to, outdo, the, raft, of, the, medusa, and, now, often, drawing, comparisons, with, effects, from, hollywood, the, leading, english, artist, in, the, style, was, john, martin, whose, tiny, figures, were, dwarfed, by, enormous, earthquakes, and, storms, and, worked, his, way, through, the, biblical, disasters, and, those, to, come, in, the, final, days, other, works, such, as, delacroix, s, death, of, sardanapalus, included, larger, figures, and, these, often, drew, heavily, on, earlier, artists, especially, poussin, and, rubens, with, extra, emotionalism, and, special, effects, elsewhere, in, europe, leading, artists, adopted, romantic, styles, in, russia, there, were, the, portraitists, orest, kiprensky, and, vasily, tropinin, with, ivan, aivazovsky, specializing, in, marine, painting, and, in, norway, hans, gude, painted, scenes, of, fjords, in, poland, piotr, micha, owski, 1800, 1855, used, a, romantic, style, in, paintings, particularly, relating, to, the, history, of, napoleonic, wars, in, italy, francesco, hayez, 1791, 1882, was, the, leading, artist, of, romanticism, in, mid, 19th, century, milan, his, long, prolific, and, extremely, successful, career, saw, him, begin, as, a, neoclassical, painter, pass, right, through, the, romantic, period, and, emerge, at, the, other, end, as, a, sentimental, painter, of, young, women, his, romantic, period, included, many, historical, pieces, of, troubadour, tendencies, but, on, a, very, large, scale, that, are, heavily, influenced, by, gian, battista, tiepolo, and, other, late, baroque, italian, masters, literary, romanticism, had, its, counterpart, in, the, american, visual, arts, most, especially, in, the, exaltation, of, an, untamed, american, landscape, found, in, the, paintings, of, the, hudson, river, school, painters, like, thomas, cole, albert, bierstadt, and, frederic, edwin, church, and, others, often, expressed, romantic, themes, in, their, paintings, they, sometimes, depicted, ancient, ruins, of, the, old, world, such, as, in, fredric, edwin, church, s, piece, sunrise, in, syria, these, works, reflected, the, gothic, feelings, of, death, and, decay, they, also, show, the, romantic, ideal, that, nature, is, powerful, and, will, eventually, overcome, the, transient, creations, of, men, more, often, they, worked, to, distinguish, themselves, from, their, european, counterparts, by, depicting, uniquely, american, scenes, and, landscapes, this, idea, of, an, american, identity, in, the, art, world, is, reflected, in, w, c, bryant, s, poem, to, cole, the, painter, departing, for, europe, where, bryant, encourages, cole, to, remember, the, powerful, scenes, that, can, only, be, found, in, america, some, american, paintings, such, as, albert, bierstadt, s, the, rocky, mountains, lander, s, peak, promote, the, literary, idea, of, the, noble, savage, by, portraying, idealized, native, americans, living, in, harmony, with, the, natural, world, thomas, cole, s, paintings, tend, towards, allegory, explicit, in, the, voyage, of, life, series, painted, in, the, early, 1840s, showing, the, stages, of, life, set, amidst, an, awesome, and, immense, nature, the, term, romanticism, when, applied, to, music, has, come, to, imply, the, period, roughly, from, 1800, until, 1850, or, else, until, around, 1900, musical, romanticism, is, predominantly, a, german, phenomenon, so, much, so, that, one, respected, french, reference, work, defines, it, entirely, in, terms, of, the, role, of, music, in, the, aesthetics, of, german, romanticism, another, french, encyclopedia, holds, that, the, german, temperament, generally, can, be, described, as, the, deep, and, diverse, action, of, romanticism, on, german, musicians, and, that, there, is, only, one, true, representative, of, romanticism, in, french, music, hector, berlioz, while, in, italy, the, sole, great, name, of, musical, romanticism, is, giuseppe, verdi, a, sort, of, hugo, of, opera, gifted, with, a, real, genius, for, dramatic, effect, similarly, in, his, analysis, of, romanticism, and, its, pursuit, of, harmony, henri, lefebvre, posits, that, but, of, course, german, romanticism, was, more, closely, linked, to, music, than, french, romanticism, was, so, it, is, there, we, should, look, for, the, direct, expression, of, harmony, as, the, central, romantic, idea, nevertheless, the, huge, popularity, of, german, romantic, music, led, whether, by, imitation, or, by, reaction, to, an, often, nationalistically, inspired, vogue, amongst, polish, hungarian, russian, czech, and, scandinavian, musicians, successful, perhaps, more, because, of, its, extra, musical, traits, than, for, the, actual, value, of, musical, works, by, its, masters, in, the, contemporary, music, culture, the, romantic, musician, followed, a, public, career, depending, on, sensitive, middle, class, audiences, rather, than, on, a, courtly, patron, as, had, been, the, case, with, earlier, musicians, and, composers, public, persona, characterized, a, new, generation, of, virtuosi, who, made, their, way, as, soloists, epitomized, in, the, concert, tours, of, paganini, and, liszt, and, the, conductor, began, to, emerge, as, an, important, figure, on, whose, skill, the, interpretation, of, the, increasingly, complex, music, depended, although, the, term, romanticism, when, applied, to, music, has, come, to, imply, the, period, roughly, from, 1800, until, 1850, or, else, until, around, 1900, the, contemporary, application, of, romantic, to, music, did, not, coincide, with, this, modern, interpretation, indeed, one, of, the, earliest, sustained, applications, of, the, term, to, music, occurs, in, 1789, in, the, m, moires, of, andr, gr, try, this, is, of, particular, interest, because, it, is, a, french, source, on, a, subject, mainly, dominated, by, germans, but, also, because, it, explicitly, acknowledges, its, debt, to, jean, jacques, rousseau, himself, a, composer, amongst, other, things, and, by, so, doing, establishes, a, link, to, one, of, the, major, influences, on, the, romantic, movement, generally, in, 1810, e, t, a, hoffmann, named, haydn, mozart, and, beethoven, as, the, three, masters, of, instrumental, compositions, who, breathe, one, and, the, same, romantic, spirit, he, justified, his, view, on, the, basis, of, these, composers, depth, of, evocative, expression, and, their, marked, individuality, in, haydn, s, music, according, to, hoffmann, a, child, like, serene, disposition, prevails, while, mozart, in, the, late, e, flat, major, symphony, for, example, leads, us, into, the, depths, of, the, spiritual, world, with, elements, of, fear, love, and, sorrow, a, presentiment, of, the, infinite, in, the, eternal, dance, of, the, spheres, beethoven, s, music, on, the, other, hand, conveys, a, sense, of, the, monstrous, and, immeasurable, with, the, pain, of, an, endless, longing, that, will, burst, our, breasts, in, a, fully, coherent, concord, of, all, the, passions, this, elevation, in, the, valuation, of, pure, emotion, resulted, in, the, promotion, of, music, from, the, subordinate, position, it, had, held, in, relation, to, the, verbal, and, plastic, arts, during, the, enlightenment, because, music, was, considered, to, be, free, of, the, constraints, of, reason, imagery, or, any, other, precise, concept, it, came, to, be, regarded, first, in, the, writings, of, wackenroder, and, tieck, and, later, by, writers, such, as, schelling, and, wagner, as, preeminent, among, the, arts, the, one, best, able, to, express, the, secrets, of, the, universe, to, evoke, the, spirit, world, infinity, and, the, absolute, this, chronologic, agreement, of, musical, and, literary, romanticism, continued, as, far, as, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, when, richard, wagner, denigrated, the, music, of, meyerbeer, and, berlioz, as, neoromantic, the, opera, to, which, we, shall, now, return, has, swallowed, down, the, neoromanticism, of, berlioz, too, as, a, plump, fine, flavoured, oyster, whose, digestion, has, conferred, on, it, anew, a, brisk, and, well, to, do, appearance, it, was, only, toward, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, that, the, newly, emergent, discipline, of, musikwissenschaft, musicology, itself, a, product, of, the, historicizing, proclivity, of, the, age, attempted, a, more, scientific, periodization, of, music, history, and, a, distinction, between, viennese, classical, and, romantic, periods, was, proposed, the, key, figure, in, this, trend, was, guido, adler, who, viewed, beethoven, and, franz, schubert, as, transitional, but, essentially, classical, composers, with, romanticism, achieving, full, maturity, only, in, the, post, beethoven, generation, of, fr, d, ric, chopin, felix, mendelssohn, robert, schumann, hector, berlioz, and, franz, liszt, from, adler, s, viewpoint, found, in, books, like, der, stil, in, der, musik, 1911, composers, of, the, new, german, school, and, various, late, 19th, century, nationalist, composers, were, not, romantics, but, moderns, or, realists, by, analogy, with, the, fields, of, painting, and, literature, and, this, schema, remained, prevalent, through, the, first, decades, of, the, 20th, century, by, the, second, quarter, of, the, 20th, century, an, awareness, that, radical, changes, in, musical, syntax, had, occurred, during, the, early, 1900s, caused, another, shift, in, historical, viewpoint, and, the, change, of, century, came, to, be, seen, as, marking, a, decisive, break, with, the, musical, past, this, in, turn, led, historians, such, as, alfred, einstein, to, extend, the, musical, romantic, era, throughout, the, 19th, century, and, into, the, first, decade, of, the, 20th, it, has, continued, to, be, referred, to, as, such, in, some, of, the, standard, music, references, such, as, the, oxford, companion, to, music, and, grout, s, history, of, western, music, but, was, not, unchallenged, for, example, the, prominent, german, musicologist, friedrich, blume, the, chief, editor, of, the, first, edition, of, die, musik, in, geschichte, und, gegenwart, 1949, 86, accepted, the, earlier, position, that, classicism, and, romanticism, together, constitute, a, single, period, beginning, in, the, middle, of, the, 18th, century, but, at, the, same, time, held, that, it, continued, into, the, 20th, century, including, such, pre, world, war, ii, developments, as, expressionism, and, neoclassicism, this, is, reflected, in, some, notable, recent, reference, works, such, as, the, new, grove, dictionary, of, music, and, musicians, and, the, new, edition, of, musik, in, geschichte, und, gegenwart, the, romantic, movement, affected, most, aspects, of, intellectual, life, and, romanticism, and, science, had, a, powerful, connection, especially, in, the, period, 1800, 1840, many, scientists, were, influenced, by, versions, of, the, naturphilosophie, of, johann, gottlieb, fichte, friedrich, wilhelm, joseph, von, schelling, and, georg, wilhelm, friedrich, hegel, and, others, and, without, abandoning, empiricism, sought, in, their, work, to, uncover, what, they, tended, to, believe, was, a, unified, and, organic, nature, the, english, scientist, sir, humphry, davy, a, prominent, romantic, thinker, said, that, understanding, nature, required, an, attitude, of, admiration, love, and, worship, a, personal, response, he, believed, that, knowledge, was, only, attainable, by, those, who, truly, appreciated, and, respected, nature, self, understanding, was, an, important, aspect, of, romanticism, it, had, less, to, do, with, proving, that, man, was, capable, of, understanding, nature, through, his, budding, intellect, and, therefore, controlling, it, and, more, to, do, with, the, emotional, appeal, of, connecting, himself, with, nature, and, understanding, it, through, a, harmonious, co, existence, history, writing, was, very, strongly, and, many, would, say, harmfully, influenced, by, romanticism, in, england, thomas, carlyle, was, a, highly, influential, essayist, who, turned, historian, he, both, invented, and, exemplified, the, phrase, hero, worship, lavishing, largely, uncritical, praise, on, strong, leaders, such, as, oliver, cromwell, frederick, the, great, and, napoleon, romantic, nationalism, had, a, largely, negative, effect, on, the, writing, of, history, in, the, 19th, century, as, each, nation, tended, to, produce, its, own, version, of, history, and, the, critical, attitude, even, cynicism, of, earlier, historians, was, often, replaced, by, a, tendency, to, create, romantic, stories, with, clearly, distinguished, heroes, and, villains, nationalist, ideology, of, the, period, placed, great, emphasis, on, racial, coherence, and, the, antiquity, of, peoples, and, tended, to, vastly, overemphasize, the, continuity, between, past, periods, and, the, present, leading, to, national, mysticism, much, historical, effort, in, the, 20th, century, was, devoted, to, combating, the, romantic, historical, myths, created, in, the, 19th, century, to, insulate, theology, from, scientism, or, reductionism, in, science, 19th, century, post, enlightenment, german, theologians, developed, a, modernist, or, so, called, liberal, conception, of, christianity, led, by, friedrich, schleiermacher, and, albrecht, ritschl, they, took, the, romantic, approach, of, rooting, religion, in, the, inner, world, of, the, human, spirit, so, that, it, is, a, person, s, feeling, or, sensibility, about, spiritual, matters, that, comprises, religion, romantic, chess, was, the, style, of, chess, which, emphasized, quick, tactical, maneuvers, characterized, by, aesthetic, beauty, rather, than, long, term, strategic, planning, which, was, considered, to, be, of, secondary, importance, the, romantic, era, in, chess, is, generally, considered, to, have, begun, around, the, 18th, century, although, a, primarily, tactical, style, of, chess, was, predominant, even, earlier, and, to, have, reached, its, peak, with, joseph, macdonnell, and, pierre, labourdonnais, the, two, dominant, chess, players, in, the, 1830s, the, 1840s, were, dominated, by, howard, staunton, and, other, leading, players, of, the, era, included, adolf, anderssen, daniel, harrwitz, henry, bird, louis, paulsen, and, paul, morphy, the, immortal, game, played, by, anderssen, and, lionel, kieseritzky, on, 21, june, 1851, in, london, where, anderssen, made, bold, sacrifices, to, secure, victory, giving, up, both, rooks, and, a, bishop, then, his, queen, and, then, checkmating, his, opponent, with, his, three, remaining, minor, pieces, is, considered, a, supreme, example, of, romantic, chess, the, end, of, the, romantic, era, in, chess, is, considered, to, be, the, 1873, vienna, tournament, where, wilhelm, steinitz, popularized, positional, play, and, the, closed, game, one, of, romanticism, s, key, ideas, and, most, enduring, legacies, is, the, assertion, of, nationalism, which, became, a, central, theme, of, romantic, art, and, political, philosophy, from, the, earliest, parts, of, the, movement, with, their, focus, on, development, of, national, languages, and, folklore, and, the, importance, of, local, customs, and, traditions, to, the, movements, that, would, redraw, the, map, of, europe, and, lead, to, calls, for, self, determination, of, nationalities, nationalism, was, one, of, the, key, vehicles, of, romanticism, its, role, expression, and, meaning, one, of, the, most, important, functions, of, medieval, references, in, the, 19th, century, was, nationalist, popular, and, epic, poetry, were, its, workhorses, this, is, visible, in, germany, and, ireland, where, underlying, germanic, or, celtic, linguistic, substrates, dating, from, before, the, romanization, latinization, were, sought, out, early, romantic, nationalism, was, strongly, inspired, by, rousseau, and, by, the, ideas, of, johann, gottfried, von, herder, who, in, 1784, argued, that, the, geography, formed, the, natural, economy, of, a, people, and, shaped, their, customs, and, society, the, nature, of, nationalism, changed, dramatically, however, after, the, french, revolution, with, the, rise, of, napoleon, and, the, reactions, in, other, nations, napoleonic, nationalism, and, republicanism, were, at, first, inspirational, to, movements, in, other, nations, self, determination, and, a, consciousness, of, national, unity, were, held, to, be, two, of, the, reasons, why, france, was, able, to, defeat, other, countries, in, battle, but, as, the, french, republic, became, napoleon, s, empire, napoleon, became, not, the, inspiration, for, nationalism, but, the, object, of, its, struggle, in, prussia, the, development, of, spiritual, renewal, as, a, means, to, engage, in, the, struggle, against, napoleon, was, argued, by, among, others, johann, gottlieb, fichte, a, disciple, of, kant, the, word, volkstum, or, nationality, was, coined, in, german, as, part, of, this, resistance, to, the, now, conquering, emperor, fichte, expressed, the, unity, of, language, and, nation, in, his, address, to, the, german, nation, in, 1806, those, who, speak, the, same, language, are, joined, to, each, other, by, a, multitude, of, invisible, bonds, by, nature, herself, long, before, any, human, art, begins, they, understand, each, other, and, have, the, power, of, continuing, to, make, themselves, understood, more, and, more, clearly, they, belong, together, and, are, by, nature, one, and, an, inseparable, whole, only, when, each, people, left, to, itself, develops, and, forms, itself, in, accordance, with, its, own, peculiar, quality, and, only, when, in, every, people, each, individual, develops, himself, in, accordance, with, that, common, quality, as, well, as, in, accordance, with, his, own, peculiar, quality, then, and, then, only, does, the, manifestation, of, divinity, appear, in, its, true, mirror, as, it, ought, to, be, this, view, of, nationalism, inspired, the, collection, of, folklore, by, such, people, as, the, brothers, grimm, the, revival, of, old, epics, as, national, and, the, construction, of, new, epics, as, if, they, were, old, as, in, the, kalevala, compiled, from, finnish, tales, and, folklore, or, ossian, where, the, claimed, ancient, roots, were, invented, the, view, that, fairy, tales, unless, contaminated, from, outside, literary, sources, were, preserved, in, the, same, form, over, thousands, of, years, was, not, exclusive, to, romantic, nationalists, but, fit, in, well, with, their, views, that, such, tales, expressed, the, primordial, nature, of, a, people, for, instance, the, brothers, grimm, rejected, many, tales, they, collected, because, of, their, similarity, to, tales, by, charles, perrault, which, they, thought, proved, they, were, not, truly, german, tales, sleeping, beauty, survived, in, their, collection, because, the, tale, of, brynhildr, convinced, them, that, the, figure, of, the, sleeping, princess, was, authentically, german, vuk,

the, russian, alexander, afanasyev, the, norwegians, peter, christen, asbj, rnsen, and, j, rgen, moe, and, the, englishman, joseph, jacobs, romanticism, played, an, essential, role, in, the, national, awakening, of, many, central, european, peoples, lacking, their, own, national, states, not, least, in, poland, which, had, recently, failed, to, restore, its, independence, when, russia, s, army, crushed, the, polish, uprising, under, nicholas, i, revival, and, reinterpretation, of, ancient, myths, customs, and, traditions, by, romantic, poets, and, painters, helped, to, distinguish, their, indigenous, cultures, from, those, of, the, dominant, nations, and, crystallise, the, mythography, of, romantic, nationalism, patriotism, nationalism, revolution, and, armed, struggle, for, independence, also, became, popular, themes, in, the, arts, of, this, period, arguably, the, most, distinguished, romantic, poet, of, this, part, of, europe, was, adam, mickiewicz, who, developed, an, idea, that, poland, was, the, messiah, of, nations, predestined, to, suffer, just, as, jesus, had, suffered, to, save, all, the, people, the, polish, self, image, as, a, christ, among, nations, or, the, martyr, of, europe, can, be, traced, back, to, its, history, of, christendom, and, suffering, under, invasions, during, the, periods, of, foreign, occupation, the, catholic, church, served, as, bastion, of, poland, s, national, identity, and, language, and, the, major, promoter, of, polish, culture, the, partitions, came, to, be, seen, in, poland, as, a, polish, sacrifice, for, the, security, for, western, civilization, adam, mickiewicz, wrote, the, patriotic, drama, dziady, directed, against, the, russians, where, he, depicts, poland, as, the, christ, of, nations, he, also, wrote, verily, i, say, unto, you, it, is, not, for, you, to, learn, civilization, from, foreigners, but, it, is, you, who, are, to, teach, them, civilization, you, are, among, the, foreigners, like, the, apostles, among, the, idolaters, in, books, of, the, polish, nation, and, polish, pilgrimage, mickiewicz, detailed, his, vision, of, poland, as, a, messias, and, a, christ, of, nations, that, would, save, mankind, dziady, is, known, for, various, interpretation, the, most, known, ones, are, the, moral, aspect, of, part, ii, individualist, and, romantic, message, of, part, iv, as, well, as, deeply, patriotic, messianistic, and, christian, vision, in, part, iii, of, the, poem, zdzis, aw, k, pi, ski, however, focuses, his, interpretation, on, slavic, pagan, and, occult, elements, found, in, the, drama, in, his, book, mickiewicz, hermetyczny, he, writes, about, hermetic, theosophic, and, alchemical, philosophy, on, the, book, as, well, as, masonic, symbols, category
