the, histories, greek, histor, ai, also, known, as, the, history, of, herodotus, is, considered, the, founding, work, of, history, in, western, literature, although, not, a, fully, impartial, record, it, remains, one, of, the, west, s, most, important, sources, regarding, these, affairs, moreover, it, established, the, genre, and, study, of, history, in, the, western, world, despite, the, existence, of, historical, records, and, chronicles, beforehand, the, histories, also, stands, as, one, of, the, earliest, accounts, of, the, rise, of, the, persian, empire, as, well, as, the, events, and, causes, of, the, greco, persian, wars, between, the, persian, empire, and, the, greek, city, states, in, the, 5th, century, bc, herodotus, portrays, the, conflict, as, one, between, the, forces, of, slavery, the, persians, on, the, one, hand, and, freedom, the, athenians, and, the, confederacy, of, greek, city, states, which, united, against, the, invaders, on, the, other, the, histories, was, at, some, point, divided, into, the, nine, books, that, appear, in, modern, editions, conventionally, named, after, the, nine, muses, herodotus, claims, to, have, traveled, extensively, around, the, ancient, world, conducting, interviews, and, collecting, stories, for, his, book, almost, all, of, which, covers, territories, of, the, persian, empire, at, the, beginning, of, the, histories, herodotus, sets, out, his, reasons, for, writing, it, here, are, presented, the, results, of, the, enquiry, carried, out, by, herodotus, of, halicarnassus, the, purpose, is, to, prevent, the, traces, of, human, events, from, being, erased, by, time, and, to, preserve, the, fame, of, the, important, and, remarkable, achievements, produced, by, both, greeks, and, non, greeks, among, the, matters, covered, is, in, particular, the, cause, of, the, hostilities, between, greeks, and, non, greeks, in, his, introduction, to, hecataeus, work, genealogies, hecataeus, the, milesian, speaks, thus, i, write, these, things, as, they, seem, true, to, me, for, the, stories, told, by, the, greeks, are, various, and, in, my, opinion, absurd, this, points, forward, to, the, folksy, yet, international, outlook, typical, of, herodotus, however, one, modern, scholar, has, described, the, work, of, hecataeus, as, a, curious, false, start, to, history, since, despite, his, critical, spirit, he, failed, to, liberate, history, from, myth, herodotus, mentions, hecataeus, in, his, histories, on, one, occasion, mocking, him, for, his, naive, genealogy, and, on, another, occasion, quoting, athenian, complaints, against, his, handling, of, their, national, history, it, is, possible, that, herodotus, borrowed, much, material, from, hecataeus, as, stated, by, porphyry, in, a, quote, recorded, by, eusebius, in, particular, it, is, possible, that, he, copied, descriptions, of, the, crocodile, hippopotamus, and, phoenix, from, hecataeus, s, circumnavigation, of, the, known, world, periegesis, periodos, ges, even, misrepresenting, the, source, as, heliopolitans, histories, 2, 73, but, hecataeus, did, not, record, events, that, had, occurred, in, living, memory, unlike, herodotus, nor, did, he, include, the, oral, traditions, of, greek, history, within, the, larger, framework, of, oriental, history, there, is, no, proof, that, herodotus, derived, the, ambitious, scope, of, his, own, work, with, its, grand, theme, of, civilizations, in, conflict, from, any, predecessor, despite, much, scholarly, speculation, about, this, in, modern, times, herodotus, claims, to, be, better, informed, than, his, predecessors, by, relying, on, empirical, observation, to, correct, their, excessive, schematism, for, example, he, argues, for, continental, asymmetry, as, opposed, to, the, older, theory, of, a, perfectly, circular, earth, with, europe, and, asia, africa, equal, in, size, histories, 4, 36, and, 4, 42, however, he, retains, idealizing, tendencies, as, in, his, symmetrical, notions, of, the, danube, and, nile, his, debt, to, previous, authors, of, prose, histories, might, be, questionable, but, there, is, no, doubt, that, herodotus, owed, much, to, the, example, and, inspiration, of, poets, and, story, tellers, for, example, athenian, tragic, poets, provided, him, with, a, world, view, of, a, balance, between, conflicting, forces, upset, by, the, hubris, of, kings, and, they, provided, his, narrative, with, a, model, of, episodic, structure, his, familiarity, with, athenian, tragedy, is, demonstrated, in, a, number, of, passages, echoing, aeschylus, s, persae, including, the, epigrammatic, observation, that, the, defeat, of, the, persian, navy, at, salamis, caused, the, defeat, of, the, land, army, histories, 8, 68, persae, 728, the, debt, may, have, been, repaid, by, sophocles, because, there, appear, to, be, echoes, of, the, histories, in, his, plays, especially, a, passage, in, antigone, that, resembles, herodotus, s, account, of, the, death, of, intaphernes, histories, 3, 119, antigone, 904, 920, however, this, point, is, one, of, the, most, contentious, issues, in, modern, scholarship, homer, was, another, inspirational, source, just, as, homer, drew, extensively, on, a, tradition, of, oral, poetry, sung, by, wandering, minstrels, so, herodotus, appears, to, have, drawn, on, an, ionian, tradition, of, story, telling, collecting, and, interpreting, the, oral, histories, he, chanced, upon, in, his, travels, these, oral, histories, often, contained, folk, tale, motifs, and, demonstrated, a, moral, yet, they, also, contained, substantial, facts, relating, to, geography, anthropology, and, history, all, compiled, by, herodotus, in, an, entertaining, style, and, format, herodotus, writes, with, the, purpose, of, explaining, that, is, he, discusses, the, reason, for, or, cause, of, an, event, he, lays, this, out, in, the, preamble, this, is, the, publication, of, the, research, of, herodotus, of, halicarnassus, so, that, the, actions, of, people, shall, not, fade, with, time, so, that, the, great, and, admirable, achievements, of, both, greeks, and, barbarians, shall, not, go, unrenowned, and, among, other, things, to, set, forth, the, reasons, why, they, waged, war, on, each, other, this, mode, of, explanation, traces, itself, all, the, way, back, to, homer, who, opened, the, iliad, by, asking, both, homer, and, herodotus, begin, with, a, question, of, causality, in, homer, s, case, who, set, these, two, at, each, other, s, throats, in, herodotus, s, case, why, did, the, greeks, and, barbarians, go, to, war, with, each, other, herodotus, s, means, of, explanation, does, not, necessarily, posit, a, simple, cause, rather, his, explanations, cover, a, host, of, potential, causes, and, emotions, it, is, notable, however, that, the, obligations, of, gratitude, and, revenge, are, the, fundamental, human, motives, for, herodotus, just, as, they, are, the, primary, stimulus, to, the, generation, of, narrative, itself, some, readers, of, herodotus, believe, that, his, habit, of, tying, events, back, to, personal, motives, signifies, an, inability, to, see, broader, and, more, abstract, reasons, for, action, gould, argues, to, the, contrary, that, this, is, likely, because, herodotus, attempts, to, provide, the, rational, reasons, as, understood, by, his, contemporaries, rather, than, providing, more, abstract, reasons, herodotus, attributes, cause, to, both, divine, and, human, agents, these, are, not, perceived, as, mutually, exclusive, but, rather, mutually, interconnected, this, is, true, of, greek, thinking, in, general, at, least, from, homer, onward, gould, notes, that, invoking, the, supernatural, in, order, to, explain, an, event, does, not, answer, the, question, why, did, this, happen, but, rather, why, did, this, happen, to, me, by, way, of, example, faulty, craftsmanship, is, the, human, cause, for, a, house, collapsing, however, divine, will, is, the, reason, that, the, house, collapses, at, the, particular, moment, when, i, am, inside, it, was, the, will, of, the, gods, that, the, house, collapsed, while, a, particular, individual, was, within, it, whereas, it, was, the, cause, of, man, that, the, house, had, a, weak, structure, and, was, prone, to, falling, some, authors, including, geoffrey, de, ste, croix, and, mabel, lang, have, argued, that, fate, or, the, belief, that, this, is, how, it, had, to, be, is, herodotus, s, ultimate, understanding, of, causality, herodotus, s, explanation, that, an, event, was, going, to, happen, maps, well, on, to, aristotelean, and, homeric, means, of, expression, the, idea, of, it, was, going, to, happen, reveals, a, tragic, discovery, associated, with, fifth, century, drama, this, tragic, discovery, can, be, seen, in, homer, s, iliad, as, well, john, gould, argues, that, herodotus, should, be, understood, as, falling, in, a, long, line, of, story, tellers, rather, than, thinking, of, his, means, of, explanation, as, a, philosophy, of, history, or, simple, causality, thus, according, to, gould, herodotus, s, means, of, explanation, is, a, mode, of, story, telling, and, narration, that, has, been, passed, down, from, generations, prior, herodotus, sense, of, what, was, going, to, happen, is, not, the, language, of, one, who, holds, a, theory, of, historical, necessity, who, sees, the, whole, of, human, experience, as, constrained, by, inevitability, and, without, room, for, human, choice, or, human, responsibility, diminished, and, belittled, by, forces, too, large, for, comprehension, or, resistance, it, is, rather, the, traditional, language, of, a, teller, of, tales, whose, tale, is, structured, by, his, awareness, of, the, shape, it, must, have, and, who, presents, human, experience, on, the, model, of, the, narrative, patterns, that, are, built, into, his, stories, the, narrative, impulse, itself, the, impulse, towards, closure, and, the, sense, of, an, ending, is, retrojected, to, become, explanation, the, accuracy, of, the, works, of, herodotus, has, been, controversial, since, his, own, era, kenton, l, sparks, writes, in, antiquity, herodotus, had, acquired, the, reputation, of, being, unreliable, biased, parsimonious, in, his, praise, of, heroes, and, mendacious, the, historian, duris, of, samos, called, herodotus, a, myth, monger, cicero, on, the, laws, i, 5, said, that, his, works, were, full, of, legends, or, fables, the, controversy, was, also, commented, on, by, aristotle, flavius, josephus, and, plutarch, the, alexandrian, grammarian, harpocration, wrote, a, whole, book, on, the, lies, of, herodotus, lucian, of, samosata, went, as, far, as, to, deny, the, father, of, history, a, place, among, the, famous, on, the, island, of, the, blessed, in, his, verae, historiae, the, works, of, thucydides, were, often, given, preference, for, their, truthfulness, and, reliability, even, if, thucydides, basically, continued, on, foundations, laid, by, herodotus, as, in, his, treatment, of, the, persian, wars, in, spite, of, these, lines, of, criticism, herodotus, works, were, in, general, kept, in, high, esteem, and, regarded, as, reliable, by, many, many, scholars, ancient, and, modern, such, as, strabo, a, h, l, heeren, etc, routinely, cited, herodotus, to, this, day, some, scholars, regard, his, works, as, being, at, least, partly, unreliable, detlev, fehling, writes, of, a, problem, recognized, by, everybody, namely, that, herodotus, frequently, cannot, be, taken, at, face, value, fehling, argues, that, herodotus, exaggerated, the, extent, of, his, travels, and, invented, his, sources, for, fehling, the, sources, of, many, stories, as, reported, by, herodotus, do, not, appear, credible, in, themselves, persian, and, egyptian, informants, tell, stories, that, dovetail, neatly, into, greek, myths, and, literature, yet, show, no, signs, of, knowing, their, own, traditions, for, fehling, the, only, credible, explanation, is, that, herodotus, invented, these, sources, and, that, the, stories, themselves, were, concocted, by, herodotus, himself, like, many, ancient, historians, herodotus, preferred, an, element, of, show, to, purely, analytic, history, aiming, to, give, pleasure, with, exciting, events, great, dramas, bizarre, exotica, as, such, certain, passages, have, been, the, subject, of, controversy, and, even, some, doubt, both, in, antiquity, and, today, despite, the, controversy, herodotus, has, long, served, and, still, serves, as, the, primary, often, only, source, for, events, in, the, greek, world, persian, empire, and, the, broader, region, in, the, two, centuries, leading, up, to, his, own, days, so, even, if, the, histories, were, criticized, in, some, regards, since, antiquity, modern, historians, and, philosophers, generally, take, a, more, positive, view, as, to, their, source, and, epistemologic, value, herodotus, is, variously, considered, father, of, comparative, anthropology, the, father, of, ethnography, and, more, modern, than, any, other, ancient, historian, in, his, approach, to, the, ideal, of, total, history, discoveries, made, since, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, have, generally, added, to, herodotus, credibility, he, described, gelonus, located, in, scythia, as, a, city, thousands, of, times, larger, than, troy, this, was, widely, disbelieved, until, it, was, rediscovered, in, 1975, the, archaeological, study, of, the, now, submerged, ancient, egyptian, city, of, heracleion, and, the, recovery, of, the, so, called, naucratis, stela, give, credibility, to, herodotus, s, previously, unsupported, claim, that, heracleion, was, founded, during, the, egyptian, new, kingdom, herodotus, claimed, to, have, visited, babylon, the, absence, of, any, mention, of, the, hanging, gardens, of, babylon, in, his, work, has, attracted, further, attacks, on, his, credibility, in, response, dalley, has, proposed, that, the, hanging, gardens, may, have, been, in, nineveh, rather, than, in, babylon, the, reliability, of, herodotus, s, writing, about, egypt, is, sometimes, questioned, alan, b, lloyd, argues, that, as, a, historical, document, the, writings, of, herodotus, are, seriously, defective, and, that, he, was, working, from, inadequate, sources, nielsen, writes, though, we, cannot, entirely, rule, out, the, possibility, of, herodotus, having, been, in, egypt, it, must, be, said, that, his, narrative, bears, little, witness, to, it, german, historian, detlev, fehling, questions, whether, herodotus, ever, traveled, up, the, nile, river, and, considers, doubtful, almost, everything, that, he, says, about, egypt, and, ethiopia, fehling, states, that, there, is, not, the, slightest, bit, of, history, behind, the, whole, story, about, the, claim, of, herodotus, that, pharaoh, sesostris, campaigned, in, europe, and, that, he, left, a, colony, in, colchia, fehling, concludes, that, the, works, of, herodotus, are, intended, as, fiction, boedeker, concurs, that, much, of, the, content, of, the, works, of, herodotus, are, literary, devices, however, a, recent, discovery, of, a, baris, described, in, the, histories, during, an, excavation, of, the, sunken, egyptian, port, city, of, thonis, heracleion, lends, credence, to, herodotus, s, travels, and, storytelling, herodotus, contribution, to, the, history, and, ethnography, of, ancient, egypt, and, africa, was, especially, valued, by, various, historians, of, the, field, such, as, constantin, fran, ois, de, chasseb, uf, comte, de, volney, w, e, b, du, bois, pierre, montet, martin, bernal, basil, davidson, derek, a, welsby, henry, t, aubin, many, scholars, explicitly, mention, the, reliability, of, herodotus, s, work, such, as, on, the, nile, valley, and, demonstrate, corroboration, of, herodotus, writings, by, modern, scholars, a, h, l, heeren, quoted, herodotus, throughout, his, work, and, provided, corroboration, by, scholars, regarding, several, passages, source, of, the, nile, location, of, mero, etc, cheikh, anta, diop, provides, several, examples, like, the, inundations, of, the, nile, which, he, argues, support, his, view, that, herodotus, was, quite, scrupulous, objective, scientific, for, his, time, diop, argues, that, herodotus, always, distinguishes, carefully, between, what, he, has, seen, and, what, he, has, been, told, diop, also, notes, that, strabo, corroborated, herodotus, ideas, about, the, black, egyptians, ethiopians, and, colchians, martin, bernal, has, relied, on, herodotus, to, an, extraordinary, degree, in, his, controversial, book, black, athena, british, egyptologist, derek, a, welsby, said, that, archaeology, graphically, confirms, herodotus, s, observations, to, further, his, work, on, the, egyptians, and, assyrians, historian, and, fiction, writer, henry, t, aubin, used, herodotus, accounts, in, various, passages, for, aubin, herodotus, was, the, author, of, the, first, important, narrative, history, of, the, world, herodotus, provides, much, information, about, the, nature, of, the, world, and, the, status, of, science, during, his, lifetime, often, engaging, in, private, speculation, likewise, for, example, he, reports, that, the, annual, flooding, of, the, nile, was, said, to, be, the, result, of, melting, snows, far, to, the, south, and, he, comments, that, he, cannot, understand, how, there, can, be, snow, in, africa, the, hottest, part, of, the, known, world, offering, an, elaborate, explanation, based, on, the, way, that, desert, winds, affect, the, passage, of, the, sun, over, this, part, of, the, world, 2, 18ff, he, also, passes, on, reports, from, phoenician, sailors, that, while, circumnavigating, africa, they, saw, the, sun, on, the, right, side, while, sailing, westwards, although, being, unaware, of, the, existence, of, the, southern, hemisphere, he, says, that, he, does, not, believe, the, claim, owing, to, this, brief, mention, which, is, included, almost, as, an, afterthought, it, has, been, argued, that, africa, was, circumnavigated, by, ancient, seafarers, for, this, is, precisely, where, the, sun, ought, to, have, been, his, accounts, of, india, are, among, the, oldest, records, of, indian, civilization, by, an, outsider, after, journeys, to, india, and, pakistan, french, ethnologist, michel, peissel, claimed, to, have, discovered, an, animal, species, that, may, illuminate, one, of, the, most, bizarre, passages, in, the, histories, in, book, 3, passages, 102, to, 105, herodotus, reports, that, a, species, of, fox, sized, furry, ants, lives, in, one, of, the, far, eastern, indian, provinces, of, the, persian, empire, this, region, he, reports, is, a, sandy, desert, and, the, sand, there, contains, a, wealth, of, fine, gold, dust, these, giant, ants, according, to, herodotus, would, often, unearth, the, gold, dust, when, digging, their, mounds, and, tunnels, and, the, people, living, in, this, province, would, then, collect, the, precious, dust, later, pliny, the, elder, would, mention, this, story, in, the, gold, mining, section, of, his, naturalis, historia, peissel, reports, that, in, an, isolated, region, of, northern, pakistan, on, the, deosai, plateau, in, gilgit, baltistan, province, there, is, a, species, of, marmot, the, himalayan, marmot, a, type, of, burrowing, squirrel, that, may, have, been, what, herodotus, called, giant, ants, the, ground, of, the, deosai, plateau, is, rich, in, gold, dust, much, like, the, province, that, herodotus, describes, according, to, peissel, he, interviewed, the, minaro, tribal, people, who, live, in, the, deosai, plateau, and, they, have, confirmed, that, they, have, for, generations, been, collecting, the, gold, dust, that, the, marmots, bring, to, the, surface, when, they, are, digging, their, burrows, peissel, offers, the, theory, that, herodotus, may, have, confused, the, old, persian, word, for, marmot, with, the, word, for, mountain, ant, research, suggests, that, herodotus, probably, did, not, know, any, persian, or, any, other, language, except, his, native, greek, and, was, forced, to, rely, on, many, local, translators, when, travelling, in, the, vast, multilingual, persian, empire, herodotus, did, not, claim, to, have, personally, seen, the, creatures, which, he, described, herodotus, did, though, follow, up, in, passage, 105, of, book, 3, with, the, claim, that, the, ants, are, said, to, chase, and, devour, full, grown, camels, some, calumnious, fictions, were, written, about, herodotus, in, a, work, titled, on, the, malice, of, herodotus, by, plutarch, a, chaeronean, by, birth, or, it, might, have, been, a, pseudo, plutarch, in, this, case, a, great, collector, of, slanders, including, the, allegation, that, the, historian, was, prejudiced, against, thebes, because, the, authorities, there, had, denied, him, permission, to, set, up, a, school, similarly, in, a, corinthian, oration, dio, chrysostom, or, yet, another, pseudonymous, author, accused, the, historian, of, prejudice, against, corinth, sourcing, it, in, personal, bitterness, over, financial, disappointments, an, account, also, given, by, marcellinus, in, his, life, of, thucydides, in, fact, herodotus, was, in, the, habit, of, seeking, out, information, from, empowered, sources, within, communities, such, as, aristocrats, and, priests, and, this, also, occurred, at, an, international, level, with, periclean, athens, becoming, his, principal, source, of, information, about, events, in, greece, as, a, result, his, reports, about, greek, events, are, often, coloured, by, athenian, bias, against, rival, states, thebes, and, corinth, in, particular, it, is, clear, from, the, beginning, of, book, 1, of, the, histories, that, herodotus, utilizes, or, at, least, claims, to, utilize, various, sources, in, his, narrative, k, h, waters, relates, that, herodotos, did, not, work, from, a, purely, hellenic, standpoint, he, was, accused, by, the, patriotic, but, somewhat, imperceptive, plutarch, of, being, philobarbaros, a, pro, barbarian, or, pro, foreigner, herodotus, at, times, relates, various, accounts, of, the, same, story, for, example, in, book, 1, he, mentions, both, the, phoenician, and, the, persian, accounts, of, io, however, herodotus, at, times, arbitrates, between, varying, accounts, i, am, not, going, to, say, that, these, events, happened, one, way, or, the, other, rather, i, will, point, out, the, man, who, i, know, for, a, fact, began, the, wrong, doing, against, the, greeks, again, later, herodotus, claims, himself, as, an, authority, i, know, this, is, how, it, happened, because, i, heard, it, from, the, delphians, myself, throughout, his, work, herodotus, attempts, to, explain, the, actions, of, people, speaking, about, solon, the, athenian, herodotus, states, sailed, away, on, the, pretext, of, seeing, the, world, but, it, was, really, so, that, he, could, not, be, compelled, to, repeal, any, of, the, laws, he, had, laid, down, again, in, the, story, about, croesus, and, his, son, s, death, when, speaking, of, adrastus, the, man, who, accidentally, killed, croesus, son, herodotus, states, adrastus, believing, himself, to, be, the, most, ill, fated, man, he, had, ever, known, cut, his, own, throat, over, the, grave, although, herodotus, considered, his, inquiries, a, serious, pursuit, of, knowledge, he, was, not, above, relating, entertaining, tales, derived, from, the, collective, body, of, myth, but, he, did, so, judiciously, with, regard, for, his, historical, method, by, corroborating, the, stories, through, enquiry, and, testing, their, probability, while, the, gods, never, make, personal, appearances, in, his, account, of, human, events, herodotus, states, emphatically, that, many, things, prove, to, me, that, the, gods, take, part, in, the, affairs, of, man, ix, 100, in, book, one, passages, 23, and, 24, herodotus, relates, the, story, of, arion, the, renowned, harp, player, second, to, no, man, living, at, that, time, who, was, saved, by, a, dolphin, herodotus, prefaces, the, story, by, noting, that, a, very, wonderful, thing, is, said, to, have, happened, and, alleges, its, veracity, by, adding, that, the, corinthians, and, the, lesbians, agree, in, their, account, of, the, matter, having, become, very, rich, while, at, the, court, of, periander, arion, conceived, a, desire, to, sail, to, italy, and, sicily, he, hired, a, vessel, crewed, by, corinthians, whom, he, felt, he, could, trust, but, the, sailors, plotted, to, throw, him, overboard, and, seize, his, wealth, arion, discovered, the, plot, and, begged, for, his, life, but, the, crew, gave, him, two, options, that, either, he, kill, himself, on, the, spot, or, jump, ship, and, fend, for, himself, in, the, sea, arion, flung, himself, into, the, water, and, a, dolphin, carried, him, to, shore, herodotus, clearly, writes, as, both, historian, and, teller, of, tales, herodotus, takes, a, fluid, position, between, the, artistic, story, weaving, of, homer, and, the, rational, data, accounting, of, later, historians, john, herington, has, developed, a, helpful, metaphor, for, describing, herodotus, s, dynamic, position, in, the, history, of, western, art, and, thought, herodotus, as, centaur, the, human, forepart, of, the, animal, is, the, urbane, and, responsible, classical, historian, the, body, indissolubly, united, to, it, is, something, out, of, the, faraway, mountains, out, of, an, older, freer, and, wilder, realm, where, our, conventions, have, no, force, herodotus, is, neither, a, mere, gatherer, of, data, nor, a, simple, teller, of, tales, he, is, both, while, herodotus, is, certainly, concerned, with, giving, accurate, accounts, of, events, this, does, not, preclude, for, him, the, insertion, of, powerful, mythological, elements, into, his, narrative, elements, which, will, aid, him, in, expressing, the, truth, of, matters, under, his, study, thus, to, understand, what, herodotus, is, doing, in, the, histories, we, must, not, impose, strict, demarcations, between, the, man, as, mythologist, and, the, man, as, historian, or, between, the, work, as, myth, and, the, work, as, history, as, james, romm, has, written, herodotus, worked, under, a, common, ancient, greek, cultural, assumption, that, the, way, events, are, remembered, and, retold, e, g, in, myths, or, legends, produces, a, valid, kind, of, understanding, even, when, this, retelling, is, not, entirely, factual, for, herodotus, then, it, takes, both, myth, and, history, to, produce, truthful, understanding, on, the, legacy, of, the, histories, of, herodotus, historian, barry, s, strauss, writes, he, is, simply, one, of, the, greatest, storytellers, who, ever, wrote, his, narrative, ability, is, one, of, the, reasons, those, who, call, herodotus, the, father, of, history, now, that, title, is, one, that, he, richly, deserves, a, greek, who, lived, in, the, fifth, century, bc, herodotus, was, a, pathfinder, he, traveled, the, eastern, mediterranean, and, beyond, to, do, research, into, human, affairs, from, greece, to, persia, from, the, sands, of, egypt, to, the, scythian, steppes, and, from, the, rivers, of, lydia, to, the, dry, hills, of, sparta, the, greek, for, research, is, historia, where, our, word, history, comes, from, herodotus, is, a, great, historian, his, work, holds, up, very, well, when, judged, by, the, yardstick, of, modern, scholarship, but, he, is, more, than, a, historian, he, is, a, philosopher, with, three, great, themes, the, struggle, between, east, and, west, the, power, of, liberty, and, the, rise, and, fall, of, empires, herodotus, takes, the, reader, from, the, rise, of, the, persian, empire, to, its, crusade, against, greek, independence, and, from, the, stirrings, of, hellenic, self, defense, to, the, beginnings, of, the, overreach, that, would, turn, athens, into, a, new, empire, of, its, own, he, goes, from, the, cosmos, to, the, atom, ranging, between, fate, and, the, gods, on, the, one, hand, and, the, ability, of, the, individual, to, make, a, difference, on, the, other, and, then, there, is, the, sheer, narrative, power, of, his, writing, the, old, master, keeps, calling, us, back, historical, novels, sourcing, material, from, herodotus
