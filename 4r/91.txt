a, fairy, tale, alternative, names, include, fairytale, fairy, story, magic, tale, or, wonder, tale, is, a, short, story, that, belongs, to, the, folklore, genre, such, stories, typically, feature, magic, enchantments, and, mythical, or, fanciful, beings, in, most, cultures, there, is, no, clear, line, separating, myth, from, folk, or, fairy, tale, all, these, together, form, the, literature, of, preliterate, societies, fairy, tales, may, be, distinguished, from, other, folk, narratives, such, as, legends, which, generally, involve, belief, in, the, veracity, of, the, events, described, and, explicit, moral, tales, including, beast, fables, prevalent, elements, include, dragons, dwarfs, elves, fairies, giants, gnomes, goblins, griffins, merfolk, monsters, pixies, talking, animals, trolls, unicorns, witches, wizards, magic, and, enchantments, in, less, technical, contexts, the, term, is, also, used, to, describe, something, blessed, with, unusual, happiness, as, in, fairy, tale, ending, a, happy, ending, or, fairy, tale, romance, colloquially, the, term, fairy, tale, or, fairy, story, can, also, mean, any, far, fetched, story, or, tall, tale, it, is, used, especially, of, any, story, that, not, only, is, not, true, but, could, not, possibly, be, true, legends, are, perceived, as, real, within, their, culture, fairy, tales, may, merge, into, legends, where, the, narrative, is, perceived, both, by, teller, and, hearers, as, being, grounded, in, historical, truth, however, unlike, legends, and, epics, fairy, tales, usually, do, not, contain, more, than, superficial, references, to, religion, and, to, actual, places, people, and, events, they, take, place, once, upon, a, time, rather, than, in, actual, times, fairy, tales, occur, both, in, oral, and, in, literary, form, literary, fairy, tale, the, name, fairy, tale, conte, de, f, es, in, french, was, first, ascribed, to, them, by, madame, d, aulnoy, in, the, late, 17th, century, many, of, today, s, fairy, tales, have, evolved, from, centuries, old, stories, that, have, appeared, with, variations, in, multiple, cultures, around, the, world, the, history, of, the, fairy, tale, is, particularly, difficult, to, trace, because, only, the, literary, forms, can, survive, still, according, to, researchers, at, universities, in, durham, and, lisbon, such, stories, may, date, back, thousands, of, years, some, to, the, bronze, age, fairy, tales, and, works, derived, from, fairy, tales, are, still, written, today, the, jatakas, are, probably, the, oldest, collection, of, such, tales, in, literature, and, the, greater, part, of, the, rest, are, demonstrably, more, than, a, thousand, years, old, it, is, certain, that, much, perhaps, one, fifth, of, the, popular, literature, of, modern, europe, is, derived, from, those, portions, of, this, large, bulk, which, came, west, with, the, crusades, through, the, medium, of, arabs, and, jews, folklorists, have, classified, fairy, tales, in, various, ways, the, aarne, thompson, uther, index, and, the, morphological, analysis, of, vladimir, propp, are, among, the, most, notable, other, folklorists, have, interpreted, the, tales, significance, but, no, school, has, been, definitively, established, for, the, meaning, of, the, tales, some, folklorists, prefer, to, use, the, german, term, m, rchen, or, wonder, tale, to, refer, to, the, genre, rather, than, fairy, tale, a, practice, given, weight, by, the, definition, of, thompson, in, his, 1977, edition, of, the, folktale, a, tale, of, some, length, involving, a, succession, of, motifs, or, episodes, it, moves, in, an, unreal, world, without, definite, locality, or, definite, creatures, and, is, filled, with, the, marvellous, in, this, never, never, land, humble, heroes, kill, adversaries, succeed, to, kingdoms, and, marry, princesses, the, characters, and, motifs, of, fairy, tales, are, simple, and, archetypal, princesses, and, goose, girls, youngest, sons, and, gallant, princes, ogres, giants, dragons, and, trolls, wicked, stepmothers, and, false, heroes, fairy, godmothers, and, other, magical, helpers, often, talking, horses, or, foxes, or, birds, glass, mountains, and, prohibitions, and, breaking, of, prohibitions, although, the, fairy, tale, is, a, distinct, genre, within, the, larger, category, of, folktale, the, definition, that, marks, a, work, as, a, fairy, tale, is, a, source, of, considerable, dispute, the, term, itself, comes, from, the, translation, of, madame, d, aulnoy, s, conte, de, f, es, first, used, in, her, collection, in, 1697, common, parlance, conflates, fairy, tales, with, beast, fables, and, other, folktales, and, scholars, differ, on, the, degree, to, which, the, presence, of, fairies, and, or, similarly, mythical, beings, e, g, elves, goblins, trolls, giants, huge, monsters, or, mermaids, should, be, taken, as, a, differentiator, vladimir, propp, in, his, morphology, of, the, folktale, criticized, the, common, distinction, between, fairy, tales, and, animal, tales, on, the, grounds, that, many, tales, contained, both, fantastic, elements, and, animals, nevertheless, to, select, works, for, his, analysis, propp, used, all, russian, folktales, classified, as, a, folklore, aarne, thompson, uther, index, 300, 749, in, a, cataloguing, system, that, made, such, a, distinction, to, gain, a, clear, set, of, tales, his, own, analysis, identified, fairy, tales, by, their, plot, elements, but, that, in, itself, has, been, criticized, as, the, analysis, does, not, lend, itself, easily, to, tales, that, do, not, involve, a, quest, and, furthermore, the, same, plot, elements, are, found, in, non, fairy, tale, works, were, i, asked, what, is, a, fairytale, i, should, reply, read, undine, that, is, a, fairytale, of, all, fairytales, i, know, i, think, undine, the, most, beautiful, as, stith, thompson, points, out, talking, animals, and, the, presence, of, magic, seem, to, be, more, common, to, the, fairy, tale, than, fairies, themselves, however, the, mere, presence, of, animals, that, talk, does, not, make, a, tale, a, fairy, tale, especially, when, the, animal, is, clearly, a, mask, on, a, human, face, as, in, fables, in, his, essay, on, fairy, stories, j, r, r, tolkien, agreed, with, the, exclusion, of, fairies, from, the, definition, defining, fairy, tales, as, stories, about, the, adventures, of, men, in, fa, rie, the, land, of, fairies, fairytale, princes, and, princesses, dwarves, elves, and, not, only, other, magical, species, but, many, other, marvels, however, the, same, essay, excludes, tales, that, are, often, considered, fairy, tales, citing, as, an, example, the, monkey, s, heart, which, andrew, lang, included, in, the, lilac, fairy, book, steven, swann, jones, identified, the, presence, of, magic, as, the, feature, by, which, fairy, tales, can, be, distinguished, from, other, sorts, of, folktales, davidson, and, chaudri, identify, transformation, as, the, key, feature, of, the, genre, from, a, psychological, point, of, view, jean, chiriac, argued, for, the, necessity, of, the, fantastic, in, these, narratives, in, terms, of, aesthetic, values, italo, calvino, cited, the, fairy, tale, as, a, prime, example, of, quickness, in, literature, because, of, the, economy, and, concision, of, the, tales, originally, stories, that, would, contemporarily, be, considered, fairy, tales, were, not, marked, out, as, a, separate, genre, the, german, term, m, rchen, stems, from, the, old, german, word, m, r, which, means, news, or, tale, the, word, m, rchen, is, the, diminutive, of, the, word, m, r, therefore, it, means, a, little, story, together, with, the, common, beginning, once, upon, a, time, this, tells, us, that, a, fairy, tale, or, a, m, rchen, was, originally, a, little, story, from, a, long, time, ago, when, the, world, was, still, magic, indeed, one, less, regular, german, opening, is, in, the, old, times, when, wishing, was, still, effective, the, french, writers, and, adaptors, of, the, conte, de, f, es, genre, often, included, fairies, in, their, stories, the, genre, name, became, fairy, tale, in, english, translation, and, gradually, eclipsed, the, more, general, term, folk, tale, that, covered, a, wide, variety, of, oral, tales, jack, zipes, also, attributes, this, shift, to, changing, sociopolitical, conditions, in, the, seventeenth, and, eighteenth, centuries, that, led, to, the, trivialization, of, these, stories, by, the, upper, classes, roots, of, the, genre, come, from, different, oral, stories, passed, down, in, european, cultures, the, genre, was, first, marked, out, by, writers, of, the, renaissance, such, as, giovanni, francesco, straparola, and, giambattista, basile, and, stabilized, through, the, works, of, later, collectors, such, as, charles, perrault, and, the, brothers, grimm, in, this, evolution, the, name, was, coined, when, the, pr, cieuses, took, up, writing, literary, stories, madame, d, aulnoy, invented, the, term, conte, de, f, e, or, fairy, tale, in, the, late, 17th, century, before, the, definition, of, the, genre, of, fantasy, many, works, that, would, now, be, classified, as, fantasy, were, termed, fairy, tales, including, tolkien, s, the, hobbit, george, orwell, s, animal, farm, and, l, frank, baum, s, the, wonderful, wizard, of, oz, indeed, tolkien, s, on, fairy, stories, includes, discussions, of, world, building, and, is, considered, a, vital, part, of, fantasy, criticism, although, fantasy, particularly, the, subgenre, of, fairytale, fantasy, draws, heavily, on, fairy, tale, motifs, the, genres, are, now, regarded, as, distinct, the, fairy, tale, told, orally, is, a, sub, class, of, the, folktale, many, writers, have, written, in, the, form, of, the, fairy, tale, these, are, the, literary, fairy, tales, or, kunstm, rchen, the, oldest, forms, from, panchatantra, to, the, pentamerone, show, considerable, reworking, from, the, oral, form, the, grimm, brothers, were, among, the, first, to, try, to, preserve, the, features, of, oral, tales, yet, the, stories, printed, under, the, grimm, name, have, been, considerably, reworked, to, fit, the, written, form, literary, fairy, tales, and, oral, fairy, tales, freely, exchanged, plots, motifs, and, elements, with, one, another, and, with, the, tales, of, foreign, lands, the, literary, fairy, tale, came, into, fashion, during, the, 17th, century, developed, by, aristocratic, women, as, a, parlour, game, this, in, turn, helped, to, maintain, the, oral, tradition, according, to, jack, zipes, the, subject, matter, of, the, conversations, consisted, of, literature, mores, taste, and, etiquette, whereby, the, speakers, all, endeavoured, to, portray, ideal, situations, in, the, most, effective, oratorical, style, that, would, gradually, have, a, major, effect, on, literary, forms, many, 18th, century, folklorists, attempted, to, recover, the, pure, folktale, uncontaminated, by, literary, versions, yet, while, oral, fairy, tales, likely, existed, for, thousands, of, years, before, the, literary, forms, there, is, no, pure, folktale, and, each, literary, fairy, tale, draws, on, folk, traditions, if, only, in, parody, this, makes, it, impossible, to, trace, forms, of, transmission, of, a, fairy, tale, oral, story, tellers, have, been, known, to, read, literary, fairy, tales, to, increase, their, own, stock, of, stories, and, treatments, the, oral, tradition, of, the, fairy, tale, came, long, before, the, written, page, tales, were, told, or, enacted, dramatically, rather, than, written, down, and, handed, down, from, generation, to, generation, because, of, this, the, history, of, their, development, is, necessarily, obscure, and, blurred, fairy, tales, appear, now, and, again, in, written, literature, throughout, literate, cultures, as, in, the, golden, ass, which, includes, cupid, and, psyche, roman, 100, 200, ad, or, the, panchatantra, india, 3rd, century, bc, but, it, is, unknown, to, what, extent, these, reflect, the, actual, folk, tales, even, of, their, own, time, the, stylistic, evidence, indicates, that, these, and, many, later, collections, reworked, folk, tales, into, literary, forms, what, they, do, show, is, that, the, fairy, tale, has, ancient, roots, older, than, the, arabian, nights, collection, of, magical, tales, compiled, circa, 1500, ad, such, as, vikram, and, the, vampire, and, bel, and, the, dragon, besides, such, collections, and, individual, tales, in, china, taoist, philosophers, such, as, liezi, and, zhuangzi, recounted, fairy, tales, in, their, philosophical, works, in, the, broader, definition, of, the, genre, the, first, famous, western, fairy, tales, are, those, of, aesop, 6th, century, bc, in, ancient, greece, scholarship, points, out, that, medieval, literature, contains, early, versions, or, predecessors, of, later, known, tales, and, motifs, such, as, the, grateful, dead, the, bird, lover, or, the, quest, for, the, lost, wife, recognizable, folktales, have, also, been, reworked, as, the, plot, of, folk, literature, and, oral, epics, jack, zipes, writes, in, when, dreams, came, true, there, are, fairy, tale, elements, in, chaucer, s, the, canterbury, tales, edmund, spenser, s, the, faerie, queene, and, in, many, of, william, shakespeare, plays, king, lear, can, be, considered, a, literary, variant, of, fairy, tales, such, as, water, and, salt, and, cap, o, rushes, the, tale, itself, resurfaced, in, western, literature, in, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, with, the, facetious, nights, of, straparola, by, giovanni, francesco, straparola, italy, 1550, and, 1553, which, contains, many, fairy, tales, in, its, inset, tales, and, the, neapolitan, tales, of, giambattista, basile, naples, 1634, 36, which, are, all, fairy, tales, carlo, gozzi, made, use, of, many, fairy, tale, motifs, among, his, commedia, dell, arte, scenarios, including, among, them, one, based, on, the, love, for, three, oranges, 1761, simultaneously, pu, songling, in, china, included, many, fairy, tales, in, his, collection, strange, stories, from, a, chinese, studio, published, posthumously, 1766, which, has, been, described, by, yuken, fujita, of, keio, university, as, having, a, reputation, as, the, most, outstanding, short, story, collection, the, fairy, tale, itself, became, popular, among, the, pr, cieuses, of, upper, class, france, 1690, 1710, and, among, the, tales, told, in, that, time, were, the, ones, of, la, fontaine, and, the, contes, of, charles, perrault, 1697, who, fixed, the, forms, of, sleeping, beauty, and, cinderella, although, straparola, s, basile, s, and, perrault, s, collections, contain, the, oldest, known, forms, of, various, fairy, tales, on, the, stylistic, evidence, all, the, writers, rewrote, the, tales, for, literary, effect, in, the, mid, 17th, century, a, vogue, for, magical, tales, emerged, among, the, intellectuals, who, frequented, the, salons, of, paris, these, salons, were, regular, gatherings, hosted, by, prominent, aristocratic, women, where, women, and, men, could, gather, together, to, discuss, the, issues, of, the, day, in, the, 1630s, aristocratic, women, began, to, gather, in, their, own, living, rooms, salons, to, discuss, the, topics, of, their, choice, arts, and, letters, politics, and, social, matters, of, immediate, concern, to, the, women, of, their, class, marriage, love, financial, and, physical, independence, and, access, to, education, this, was, a, time, when, women, were, barred, from, receiving, a, formal, education, some, of, the, most, gifted, women, writers, of, the, period, came, out, of, these, early, salons, such, as, madeleine, de, scud, ry, and, madame, de, lafayette, which, encouraged, women, s, independence, and, pushed, against, the, gender, barriers, that, defined, their, lives, the, salonni, res, argued, particularly, for, love, and, intellectual, compatibility, between, the, sexes, opposing, the, system, of, arranged, marriages, sometime, in, the, middle, of, the, 17th, century, a, passion, for, the, conversational, parlour, game, based, on, the, plots, of, old, folk, tales, swept, through, the, salons, each, salonni, re, was, called, upon, to, retell, an, old, tale, or, rework, an, old, theme, spinning, clever, new, stories, that, not, only, showcased, verbal, agility, and, imagination, but, also, slyly, commented, on, the, conditions, of, aristocratic, life, great, emphasis, was, placed, on, a, mode, of, delivery, that, seemed, natural, and, spontaneous, the, decorative, language, of, the, fairy, tales, served, an, important, function, disguising, the, rebellious, subtext, of, the, stories, and, sliding, them, past, the, court, censors, critiques, of, court, life, and, even, of, the, king, were, embedded, in, extravagant, tales, and, in, dark, sharply, dystopian, ones, not, surprisingly, the, tales, by, women, often, featured, young, but, clever, aristocratic, girls, whose, lives, were, controlled, by, the, arbitrary, whims, of, fathers, kings, and, elderly, wicked, fairies, as, well, as, tales, in, which, groups, of, wise, fairies, i, e, intelligent, independent, women, stepped, in, and, put, all, to, rights, the, salon, tales, as, they, were, originally, written, and, published, have, been, preserved, in, a, monumental, work, called, le, cabinet, des, f, es, an, enormous, collection, of, stories, from, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, the, first, collectors, to, attempt, to, preserve, not, only, the, plot, and, characters, of, the, tale, but, also, the, style, in, which, they, were, told, was, the, brothers, grimm, collecting, german, fairy, tales, ironically, this, meant, although, their, first, edition, 1812, 1815, remains, a, treasure, for, folklorists, they, rewrote, the, tales, in, later, editions, to, make, them, more, acceptable, which, ensured, their, sales, and, the, later, popularity, of, their, work, such, literary, forms, did, not, merely, draw, from, the, folktale, but, also, influenced, folktales, in, turn, the, brothers, grimm, rejected, several, tales, for, their, collection, though, told, orally, to, them, by, germans, because, the, tales, derived, from, perrault, and, they, concluded, they, were, thereby, french, and, not, german, tales, an, oral, version, of, bluebeard, was, thus, rejected, and, the, tale, of, little, briar, rose, clearly, related, to, perrault, s, sleeping, beauty, was, included, only, because, jacob, grimm, convinced, his, brother, that, the, figure, of, brynhildr, from, much, earlier, norse, mythology, proved, that, the, sleeping, princess, was, authentically, germanic, folklore, this, consideration, of, whether, to, keep, sleeping, beauty, reflected, a, belief, common, among, folklorists, of, the, 19th, century, that, the, folk, tradition, preserved, fairy, tales, in, forms, from, pre, history, except, when, contaminated, by, such, literary, forms, leading, people, to, tell, inauthentic, tales, the, rural, illiterate, and, uneducated, peasants, if, suitably, isolated, were, the, folk, and, would, tell, pure, folk, tales, sometimes, they, regarded, fairy, tales, as, a, form, of, fossil, the, remnants, of, a, once, perfect, tale, however, further, research, has, concluded, that, fairy, tales, never, had, a, fixed, form, and, regardless, of, literary, influence, the, tellers, constantly, altered, them, for, their, own, purposes, the, work, of, the, brothers, grimm, influenced, other, collectors, both, inspiring, them, to, collect, tales, and, leading, them, to, similarly, believe, in, a, spirit, of, romantic, nationalism, that, the, fairy, tales, of, a, country, were, particularly, representative, of, it, to, the, neglect, of, cross, cultural, influence, among, those, influenced, were, the, russian, alexander, afanasyev, first, published, in, 1866, the, norwegians, peter, christen, asbj, rnsen, and, j, rgen, moe, first, published, in, 1845, the, romanian, petre, ispirescu, first, published, in, 1874, the, english, joseph, jacobs, first, published, in, 1890, and, jeremiah, curtin, an, american, who, collected, irish, tales, first, published, in, 1890, ethnographers, collected, fairy, tales, throughout, the, world, finding, similar, tales, in, africa, the, americas, and, australia, andrew, lang, was, able, to, draw, on, not, only, the, written, tales, of, europe, and, asia, but, those, collected, by, ethnographers, to, fill, his, coloured, fairy, books, series, they, also, encouraged, other, collectors, of, fairy, tales, as, when, yei, theodora, ozaki, created, a, collection, japanese, fairy, tales, 1908, after, encouragement, from, lang, simultaneously, writers, such, as, hans, christian, andersen, and, george, macdonald, continued, the, tradition, of, literary, fairy, tales, andersen, s, work, sometimes, drew, on, old, folktales, but, more, often, deployed, fairytale, motifs, and, plots, in, new, tales, macdonald, incorporated, fairytale, motifs, both, in, new, literary, fairy, tales, such, as, the, light, princess, and, in, works, of, the, genre, that, would, become, fantasy, as, in, the, princess, and, the, goblin, or, lilith, two, theories, of, origins, have, attempted, to, explain, the, common, elements, in, fairy, tales, found, spread, over, continents, one, is, that, a, single, point, of, origin, generated, any, given, tale, which, then, spread, over, the, centuries, the, other, is, that, such, fairy, tales, stem, from, common, human, experience, and, therefore, can, appear, separately, in, many, different, origins, fairy, tales, with, very, similar, plots, characters, and, motifs, are, found, spread, across, many, different, cultures, many, researchers, hold, this, to, be, caused, by, the, spread, of, such, tales, as, people, repeat, tales, they, have, heard, in, foreign, lands, although, the, oral, nature, makes, it, impossible, to, trace, the, route, except, by, inference, folklorists, have, attempted, to, determine, the, origin, by, internal, evidence, which, can, not, always, be, clear, joseph, jacobs, comparing, the, scottish, tale, the, ridere, of, riddles, with, the, version, collected, by, the, brothers, grimm, the, riddle, noted, that, in, the, ridere, of, riddles, one, hero, ends, up, polygamously, married, which, might, point, to, an, ancient, custom, but, in, the, riddle, the, simpler, riddle, might, argue, greater, antiquity, folklorists, of, the, finnish, or, historical, geographical, school, attempted, to, place, fairy, tales, to, their, origin, with, inconclusive, results, sometimes, influence, especially, within, a, limited, area, and, time, is, clearer, as, when, considering, the, influence, of, perrault, s, tales, on, those, collected, by, the, brothers, grimm, little, briar, rose, appears, to, stem, from, perrault, s, the, sleeping, beauty, as, the, grimms, tale, appears, to, be, the, only, independent, german, variant, similarly, the, close, agreement, between, the, opening, of, the, grimms, version, of, little, red, riding, hood, and, perrault, s, tale, points, to, an, influence, although, the, grimms, version, adds, a, different, ending, perhaps, derived, from, the, wolf, and, the, seven, young, kids, fairy, tales, tend, to, take, on, the, color, of, their, location, through, the, choice, of, motifs, the, style, in, which, they, are, told, and, the, depiction, of, character, and, local, color, the, brothers, grimm, believed, that, european, fairy, tales, derived, from, the, cultural, history, shared, by, all, indo, european, peoples, and, were, therefore, ancient, far, older, than, written, records, this, view, is, supported, by, research, by, the, anthropologist, jamie, tehrani, and, the, folklorist, sara, graca, da, silva, using, phylogenetic, analysis, a, technique, developed, by, evolutionary, biologists, to, trace, the, relatedness, of, living, and, fossil, species, among, the, tales, analysed, were, jack, and, the, beanstalk, traced, to, the, time, of, splitting, of, eastern, and, western, indo, european, over, 5000, years, ago, both, beauty, and, the, beast, and, rumpelstiltskin, appear, to, have, been, created, some, 4000, years, ago, the, story, of, the, smith, and, the, devil, deal, with, the, devil, appears, to, date, from, the, bronze, age, some, 6000, years, ago, various, other, studies, converge, to, suggest, that, some, fairy, tales, for, example, the, swan, maiden, could, go, back, to, the, upper, palaeolithic, originally, adults, were, the, audience, of, a, fairy, tale, just, as, often, as, children, literary, fairy, tales, appeared, in, works, intended, for, adults, but, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, the, fairy, tale, became, associated, with, children, s, literature, the, pr, cieuses, including, madame, d, aulnoy, intended, their, works, for, adults, but, regarded, their, source, as, the, tales, that, servants, or, other, women, of, lower, class, would, tell, to, children, indeed, a, novel, of, that, time, depicting, a, countess, s, suitor, offering, to, tell, such, a, tale, has, the, countess, exclaim, that, she, loves, fairy, tales, as, if, she, were, still, a, child, among, the, late, pr, cieuses, jeanne, marie, leprince, de, beaumont, redacted, a, version, of, beauty, and, the, beast, for, children, and, it, is, her, tale, that, is, best, known, today, the, brothers, grimm, titled, their, collection, children, s, and, household, tales, and, rewrote, their, tales, after, complaints, that, they, were, not, suitable, for, children, in, the, modern, era, fairy, tales, were, altered, so, that, they, could, be, read, to, children, the, brothers, grimm, concentrated, mostly, on, sexual, references, rapunzel, in, the, first, edition, revealed, the, prince, s, visits, by, asking, why, her, clothing, had, grown, tight, thus, letting, the, witch, deduce, that, she, was, pregnant, but, in, subsequent, editions, carelessly, revealed, that, it, was, easier, to, pull, up, the, prince, than, the, witch, on, the, other, hand, in, many, respects, violence, particularly, when, punishing, villains, was, increased, other, later, revisions, cut, out, violence, j, r, r, tolkien, noted, that, the, juniper, tree, often, had, its, cannibalistic, stew, cut, out, in, a, version, intended, for, children, the, moralizing, strain, in, the, victorian, era, altered, the, classical, tales, to, teach, lessons, as, when, george, cruikshank, rewrote, cinderella, in, 1854, to, contain, temperance, themes, his, acquaintance, charles, dickens, protested, in, an, utilitarian, age, of, all, other, times, it, is, a, matter, of, grave, importance, that, fairy, tales, should, be, respected, psychoanalysts, such, as, bruno, bettelheim, who, regarded, the, cruelty, of, older, fairy, tales, as, indicative, of, psychological, conflicts, strongly, criticized, this, expurgation, because, it, weakened, their, usefulness, to, both, children, and, adults, as, ways, of, symbolically, resolving, issues, fairy, tales, do, teach, children, how, to, deal, with, difficult, times, to, quote, rebecca, walters, 2017, p, 56, fairytales, and, folktales, are, part, of, the, cultural, conserve, that, can, be, used, to, address, children, s, fears, and, give, them, some, role, training, in, an, approach, that, honors, the, children, s, window, of, tolerance, these, fairy, tales, teach, children, how, to, deal, with, certain, social, situations, and, helps, them, to, find, their, place, in, society, fairy, tales, teach, children, other, important, lessons, too, for, example, tsitsani, et, al, carried, out, a, study, on, children, to, determine, the, benefits, of, fairy, tales, parents, of, the, children, who, took, part, in, the, study, found, that, fairy, tales, especially, the, color, in, them, triggered, their, child, s, imagination, as, they, read, them, jungian, analyst, and, fairy, tale, scholar, marie, louise, von, franz, interprets, fairy, tales, based, on, jung, s, view, of, fairy, tales, as, a, spontaneous, and, naive, product, of, soul, which, can, only, express, what, soul, is, that, means, she, looks, at, fairy, tales, as, images, of, different, phases, of, experiencing, the, reality, of, the, soul, they, are, the, purest, and, simplest, expression, of, collective, unconscious, psychic, processes, and, they, represent, the, archetypes, in, their, simplest, barest, and, most, concise, form, because, they, are, less, overlaid, with, conscious, material, than, myths, and, legends, in, this, pure, form, the, archetypal, images, afford, us, the, best, clues, to, the, understanding, of, the, processes, going, on, in, the, collective, psyche, the, fairy, tale, itself, is, its, own, best, explanation, that, is, its, meaning, is, contained, in, the, totality, of, its, motifs, connected, by, the, thread, of, the, story, every, fairy, tale, is, a, relatively, closed, system, compounding, one, essential, psychological, meaning, which, is, expressed, in, a, series, of, symbolical, pictures, and, events, and, is, discoverable, in, these, i, have, come, to, the, conclusion, that, all, fairy, tales, endeavour, to, describe, one, and, the, same, psychic, fact, but, a, fact, so, complex, and, far, reaching, and, so, difficult, for, us, to, realize, in, all, its, different, aspects, that, hundreds, of, tales, and, thousands, of, repetitions, with, a, musician, s, variation, are, needed, until, this, unknown, fact, is, delivered, into, consciousness, and, even, then, the, theme, is, not, exhausted, this, unknown, fact, is, what, jung, calls, the, self, which, is, the, psychic, reality, of, the, collective, unconscious, every, archetype, is, in, its, essence, only, one, aspect, of, the, collective, unconscious, as, well, as, always, representing, also, the, whole, collective, unconscious, other, famous, people, commented, on, the, importance, of, fairy, tales, especially, for, children, for, example, g, k, chesterton, argued, that, fairy, tales, then, are, not, responsible, for, producing, in, children, fear, or, any, of, the, shapes, of, fear, fairy, tales, do, not, give, the, child, the, idea, of, the, evil, or, the, ugly, that, is, in, the, child, already, because, it, is, in, the, world, already, fairy, tales, do, not, give, the, child, his, first, idea, of, bogey, what, fairy, tales, give, the, child, is, his, first, clear, idea, of, the, possible, defeat, of, bogey, the, baby, has, known, the, dragon, intimately, ever, since, he, had, an, imagination, what, the, fairy, tale, provides, for, him, is, a, st, george, to, kill, the, dragon, albert, einstein, once, showed, how, important, he, believed, fairy, tales, were, for, children, s, intelligence, in, the, quote, if, you, want, your, children, to, be, intelligent, read, them, fairytales, if, you, want, them, to, be, more, intelligent, read, them, more, fairytales, the, adaptation, of, fairy, tales, for, children, continues, walt, disney, s, influential, snow, white, and, the, seven, dwarfs, was, largely, although, certainly, not, solely, intended, for, the, children, s, market, the, anime, magical, princess, minky, momo, draws, on, the, fairy, tale, momotar, jack, zipes, has, spent, many, years, working, to, make, the, older, traditional, stories, accessible, to, modern, readers, and, their, children, many, fairy, tales, feature, an, absentee, mother, as, an, example, beauty, and, the, beast, the, little, mermaid, little, red, riding, hood, and, donkeyskin, where, the, mother, is, deceased, or, absent, and, unable, to, help, the, heroines, mothers, are, depicted, as, absent, or, wicked, in, the, most, popular, contemporary, versions, of, tales, like, rapunzel, snow, white, cinderella, and, hansel, and, gretel, however, some, lesser, known, tales, or, variants, such, as, those, found, in, volumes, edited, by, angela, carter, and, jane, yolen, depict, mothers, in, a, more, positive, light, carter, s, protagonist, in, the, bloody, chamber, is, an, impoverished, piano, student, married, to, a, marquis, who, was, much, older, than, herself, to, banish, the, spectre, of, poverty, the, story, is, a, variant, on, bluebeard, a, tale, about, a, wealthy, man, who, murders, numerous, young, women, carter, s, protagonist, who, is, unnamed, describes, her, mother, as, eagle, featured, and, indomitable, her, mother, is,

revolver, and, once, shot, a, man, eating, tiger, with, her, own, hand, in, contemporary, literature, many, authors, have, used, the, form, of, fairy, tales, for, various, reasons, such, as, examining, the, human, condition, from, the, simple, framework, a, fairytale, provides, some, authors, seek, to, recreate, a, sense, of, the, fantastic, in, a, contemporary, discourse, some, writers, use, fairy, tale, forms, for, modern, issues, this, can, include, using, the, psychological, dramas, implicit, in, the, story, as, when, robin, mckinley, retold, donkeyskin, as, the, novel, deerskin, with, emphasis, on, the, abusive, treatment, the, father, of, the, tale, dealt, to, his, daughter, sometimes, especially, in, children, s, literature, fairy, tales, are, retold, with, a, twist, simply, for, comic, effect, such, as, the, stinky, cheese, man, by, jon, scieszka, and, the, asbo, fairy, tales, by, chris, pilbeam, a, common, comic, motif, is, a, world, where, all, the, fairy, tales, take, place, and, the, characters, are, aware, of, their, role, in, the, story, such, as, in, the, film, series, shrek, other, authors, may, have, specific, motives, such, as, multicultural, or, feminist, reevaluations, of, predominantly, eurocentric, masculine, dominated, fairy, tales, implying, critique, of, older, narratives, the, figure, of, the, damsel, in, distress, has, been, particularly, attacked, by, many, feminist, critics, examples, of, narrative, reversal, rejecting, this, figure, include, the, paperbag, princess, by, robert, munsch, a, picture, book, aimed, at, children, in, which, a, princess, rescues, a, prince, angela, carter, s, the, bloody, chamber, which, retells, a, number, of, fairy, tales, from, a, female, point, of, view, and, simon, hood, s, contemporary, interpretation, of, various, popular, classics, there, are, also, many, contemporary, erotic, retellings, of, fairy, tales, which, explicitly, draw, upon, the, original, spirit, of, the, tales, and, are, specifically, for, adults, modern, retellings, focus, on, exploring, the, tale, through, use, of, the, erotic, explicit, sexuality, dark, and, or, comic, themes, female, empowerment, fetish, and, bdsm, multicultural, and, heterosexual, characters, cleis, press, has, released, several, fairy, tale, themed, erotic, anthologies, including, fairy, tale, lust, lustfully, ever, after, and, a, princess, bound, it, may, be, hard, to, lay, down, the, rule, between, fairy, tales, and, fantasies, that, use, fairy, tale, motifs, or, even, whole, plots, but, the, distinction, is, commonly, made, even, within, the, works, of, a, single, author, george, macdonald, s, lilith, and, phantastes, are, regarded, as, fantasies, while, his, the, light, princess, the, golden, key, and, the, wise, woman, are, commonly, called, fairy, tales, the, most, notable, distinction, is, that, fairytale, fantasies, like, other, fantasies, make, use, of, novelistic, writing, conventions, of, prose, characterization, or, setting, fairy, tales, have, been, enacted, dramatically, records, exist, of, this, in, commedia, dell, arte, and, later, in, pantomime, unlike, oral, and, literacy, form, fairy, tales, in, film, is, considered, one, of, the, most, effective, way, to, convey, the, story, to, the, audience, the, advent, of, cinema, has, meant, that, such, stories, could, be, presented, in, a, more, plausible, manner, with, the, use, of, special, effects, and, animation, the, walt, disney, company, has, had, a, significant, impact, on, the, evolution, of, the, fairy, tale, film, some, of, the, earliest, short, silent, films, from, the, disney, studio, were, based, on, fairy, tales, and, some, fairy, tales, were, adapted, into, shorts, in, the, musical, comedy, series, silly, symphony, such, as, three, little, pigs, walt, disney, s, first, feature, length, film, snow, white, and, the, seven, dwarfs, released, in, 1937, was, a, ground, breaking, film, for, fairy, tales, and, indeed, fantasy, in, general, with, the, cost, of, over, 400, percent, of, the, budget, and, more, than, 300, artists, assistants, and, animators, snow, white, and, the, seven, dwarfs, was, arguably, one, of, the, highest, work, force, demanded, film, at, that, time, the, studio, even, hired, don, graham, to, open, animation, training, programs, for, more, than, 700, staffs, as, for, the, motion, capture, and, personality, expression, the, studio, used, a, dancer, marjorie, celeste, from, the, beginning, to, the, end, for, the, best, results, disney, and, his, creative, successors, have, returned, to, traditional, and, literary, fairy, tales, numerous, times, with, films, such, as, cinderella, 1950, sleeping, beauty, 1959, the, little, mermaid, 1989, and, beauty, and, the, beast, 1991, disney, s, influence, helped, establish, the, fairy, tale, genre, as, a, genre, for, children, and, has, been, accused, by, some, of, bowdlerizing, the, gritty, naturalism, and, sometimes, unhappy, endings, of, many, folk, fairy, tales, however, others, note, that, the, softening, of, fairy, tales, occurred, long, before, disney, some, of, which, was, even, done, by, the, grimm, brothers, themselves, many, filmed, fairy, tales, have, been, made, primarily, for, children, from, disney, s, later, works, to, aleksandr, rou, s, retelling, of, vasilissa, the, beautiful, the, first, soviet, film, to, use, russian, folk, tales, in, a, big, budget, feature, others, have, used, the, conventions, of, fairy, tales, to, create, new, stories, with, sentiments, more, relevant, to, contemporary, life, as, in, labyrinth, my, neighbor, totoro, happily, n, ever, after, and, the, films, of, michel, ocelot, other, works, have, retold, familiar, fairy, tales, in, a, darker, more, horrific, or, psychological, variant, aimed, primarily, at, adults, notable, examples, are, jean, cocteau, s, beauty, and, the, beast, and, the, company, of, wolves, based, on, angela, carter, s, retelling, of, little, red, riding, hood, likewise, princess, mononoke, pan, s, labyrinth, suspiria, and, spike, create, new, stories, in, this, genre, from, fairy, tale, and, folklore, motifs, in, comics, and, animated, tv, series, the, sandman, revolutionary, girl, utena, princess, tutu, fables, and, m, r, all, make, use, of, standard, fairy, tale, elements, to, various, extents, but, are, more, accurately, categorised, as, fairytale, fantasy, due, to, the, definite, locations, and, characters, which, a, longer, narrative, requires, a, more, modern, cinematic, fairy, tale, would, be, luchino, visconti, s, le, notti, bianche, starring, marcello, mastroianni, before, he, became, a, superstar, it, involves, many, of, the, romantic, conventions, of, fairy, tales, yet, it, takes, place, in, post, world, war, ii, italy, and, it, ends, realistically, in, recent, years, disney, has, been, dominating, the, fairy, tale, film, industry, by, remaking, their, animated, fairy, tale, films, into, live, action, examples, include, maleficent, 2014, cinderella, 2015, beauty, and, the, beast, 2017, and, so, on, any, comparison, of, fairy, tales, quickly, discovers, that, many, fairy, tales, have, features, in, common, with, each, other, two, of, the, most, influential, classifications, are, those, of, antti, aarne, as, revised, by, stith, thompson, into, the, aarne, thompson, classification, system, and, vladimir, propp, s, morphology, of, the, folk, tale, this, system, groups, fairy, and, folk, tales, according, to, their, overall, plot, common, identifying, features, are, picked, out, to, decide, which, tales, are, grouped, together, much, therefore, depends, on, what, features, are, regarded, as, decisive, for, instance, tales, like, cinderella, in, which, a, persecuted, heroine, with, the, help, of, the, fairy, godmother, or, similar, magical, helper, attends, an, event, or, three, in, which, she, wins, the, love, of, a, prince, and, is, identified, as, his, true, bride, are, classified, as, type, 510, the, persecuted, heroine, some, such, tales, are, the, wonderful, birch, aschenputtel, katie, woodencloak, the, story, of, tam, and, cam, ye, xian, cap, o, rushes, catskin, fair, brown, and, trembling, finette, cendron, allerleirauh, further, analysis, of, the, tales, shows, that, in, cinderella, the, wonderful, birch, the, story, of, tam, and, cam, ye, xian, and, aschenputtel, the, heroine, is, persecuted, by, her, stepmother, and, refused, permission, to, go, to, the, ball, or, other, event, and, in, fair, brown, and, trembling, and, finette, cendron, by, her, sisters, and, other, female, figures, and, these, are, grouped, as, 510a, while, in, cap, o, rushes, catskin, and, allerleirauh, the, heroine, is, driven, from, home, by, her, father, s, persecutions, and, must, take, work, in, a, kitchen, elsewhere, and, these, are, grouped, as, 510b, but, in, katie, woodencloak, she, is, driven, from, home, by, her, stepmother, s, persecutions, and, must, take, service, in, a, kitchen, elsewhere, and, in, tattercoats, she, is, refused, permission, to, go, to, the, ball, by, her, grandfather, given, these, features, common, with, both, types, of, 510, katie, woodencloak, is, classified, as, 510a, because, the, villain, is, the, stepmother, and, tattercoats, as, 510b, because, the, grandfather, fills, the, father, s, role, this, system, has, its, weaknesses, in, the, difficulty, of, having, no, way, to, classify, subportions, of, a, tale, as, motifs, rapunzel, is, type, 310, the, maiden, in, the, tower, but, it, opens, with, a, child, being, demanded, in, return, for, stolen, food, as, does, puddocky, but, puddocky, is, not, a, maiden, in, the, tower, tale, while, the, canary, prince, which, opens, with, a, jealous, stepmother, is, it, also, lends, itself, to, emphasis, on, the, common, elements, to, the, extent, that, the, folklorist, describes, the, black, bull, of, norroway, as, the, same, story, as, beauty, and, the, beast, this, can, be, useful, as, a, shorthand, but, can, also, erase, the, coloring, and, details, of, a, story, vladimir, propp, specifically, studied, a, collection, of, russian, fairy, tales, but, his, analysis, has, been, found, useful, for, the, tales, of, other, countries, having, criticized, aarne, thompson, type, analysis, for, ignoring, what, motifs, did, in, stories, and, because, the, motifs, used, were, not, clearly, distinct, he, analyzed, the, tales, for, the, function, each, character, and, action, fulfilled, and, concluded, that, a, tale, was, composed, of, thirty, one, elements, functions, and, seven, characters, or, spheres, of, action, the, princess, and, her, father, are, a, single, sphere, while, the, elements, were, not, all, required, for, all, tales, when, they, appeared, they, did, so, in, an, invariant, order, except, that, each, individual, element, might, be, negated, twice, so, that, it, would, appear, three, times, as, when, in, brother, and, sister, the, brother, resists, drinking, from, enchanted, streams, twice, so, that, it, is, the, third, that, enchants, him, propp, s, 31, functions, also, fall, within, six, stages, preparation, complication, transference, struggle, return, recognition, and, a, stage, can, also, be, repeated, which, can, affect, the, perceived, order, of, elements, one, such, element, is, the, donor, who, gives, the, hero, magical, assistance, often, after, testing, him, in, the, golden, bird, the, talking, fox, tests, the, hero, by, warning, him, against, entering, an, inn, and, after, he, succeeds, helps, him, find, the, object, of, his, quest, in, the, boy, who, drew, cats, the, priest, advised, the, hero, to, stay, in, small, places, at, night, which, protects, him, from, an, evil, spirit, in, cinderella, the, fairy, godmother, gives, cinderella, the, dresses, she, needs, to, attend, the, ball, as, their, mothers, spirits, do, in, bawang, putih, bawang, merah, and, the, wonderful, birch, in, the, fox, sister, a, buddhist, monk, gives, the, brothers, magical, bottles, to, protect, against, the, fox, spirit, the, roles, can, be, more, complicated, in, the, red, ettin, the, role, is, split, into, the, mother, who, offers, the, hero, the, whole, of, a, journey, cake, with, her, curse, or, half, with, her, blessing, and, when, he, takes, the, half, a, fairy, who, gives, him, advice, in, mr, simigd, li, the, sun, the, moon, and, the, stars, all, give, the, heroine, a, magical, gift, characters, who, are, not, always, the, donor, can, act, like, the, donor, in, kallo, and, the, goblins, the, villain, goblins, also, give, the, heroine, gifts, because, they, are, tricked, in, schippeitaro, the, evil, cats, betray, their, secret, to, the, hero, giving, him, the, means, to, defeat, them, other, fairy, tales, such, as, the, story, of, the, youth, who, went, forth, to, learn, what, fear, was, do, not, feature, the, donor, analogies, have, been, drawn, between, this, and, the, analysis, of, myths, into, the, hero, s, journey, many, fairy, tales, have, been, interpreted, for, their, purported, significance, one, mythological, interpretation, saw, many, fairy, tales, including, hansel, and, gretel, sleeping, beauty, and, the, frog, king, as, solar, myths, this, mode, of, interpretation, subsequently, became, rather, less, popular, freudian, jungian, and, other, psychological, analyses, have, also, explicated, many, tales, but, no, mode, of, interpretation, has, established, itself, definitively, specific, analyses, have, often, been, criticized, for, lending, great, importance, to, motifs, that, are, not, in, fact, integral, to, the, tale, this, has, often, stemmed, from, treating, one, instance, of, a, fairy, tale, as, the, definitive, text, where, the, tale, has, been, told, and, retold, in, many, variations, in, variants, of, bluebeard, the, wife, s, curiosity, is, betrayed, by, a, blood, stained, key, by, an, egg, s, breaking, or, by, the, singing, of, a, rose, she, wore, without, affecting, the, tale, but, interpretations, of, specific, variants, have, claimed, that, the, precise, object, is, integral, to, the, tale, other, folklorists, have, interpreted, tales, as, historical, documents, many, german, folklorists, believing, the, tales, to, have, preserved, details, from, ancient, times, have, used, the, grimms, tales, to, explain, ancient, customs, one, approach, sees, the, topography, of, european, m, rchen, as, echoing, the, period, immediately, following, the, last, ice, age, other, folklorists, have, explained, the, figure, of, the, wicked, stepmother, in, a, historical, sociological, context, many, women, did, die, in, childbirth, their, husbands, remarried, and, the, new, stepmothers, competed, with, the, children, of, the, first, marriage, for, resources, in, a, 2012, lecture, jack, zipes, reads, fairy, tales, as, examples, of, what, he, calls, childism, he, suggests, that, there, are, terrible, aspects, to, the, tales, which, among, other, things, have, conditioned, children, to, accept, mistreatment, and, even, abuse, fairy, tales, have, inspired, music, namely, opera, such, as, the, french, op, ra, f, erie, and, the, german, m, rchenoper, french, examples, include, gretry, s, z, mire, et, azor, and, auber, s, le, cheval, de, bronze, german, operas, are, mozart, s, die,
