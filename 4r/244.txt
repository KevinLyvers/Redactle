https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetic_Edda
the, poetic, edda, is, the, modern, name, for, an, untitled, collection, of, old, norse, anonymous, narrative, poems, in, alliterative, verse, it, is, distinct, from, the, closely, related, prose, edda, although, both, works, are, seminal, to, the, study, of, old, norse, poetry, several, versions, of, the, poetic, edda, exist, especially, notable, is, the, medieval, icelandic, manuscript, codex, regius, which, contains, 31, poems, the, codex, regius, is, arguably, the, most, important, extant, source, on, norse, mythology, and, germanic, heroic, legends, since, the, early, 19th, century, it, has, had, a, powerful, influence, on, scandinavian, literature, not, only, through, its, stories, but, also, through, the, visionary, force, and, the, dramatic, quality, of, many, of, the, poems, it, has, also, been, an, inspiration, for, later, innovations, in, poetic, meter, particularly, in, nordic, languages, with, its, use, of, terse, stress, based, metrical, schemes, that, lack, final, rhymes, instead, focusing, on, alliterative, devices, and, strongly, concentrated, imagery, poets, who, have, acknowledged, their, debt, to, the, codex, regius, include, vilhelm, ekelund, august, strindberg, j, r, r, tolkien, ezra, pound, jorge, luis, borges, and, karin, boye, the, codex, regius, was, written, during, the, 13th, century, but, nothing, was, known, of, its, whereabouts, until, 1643, when, it, came, into, the, possession, of, brynj, lfur, sveinsson, then, bishop, of, sk, lholt, at, the, time, versions, of, the, prose, edda, were, known, in, iceland, but, scholars, speculated, that, there, once, was, another, edda, an, elder, edda, which, contained, the, pagan, poems, that, snorri, quotes, in, his, prose, edda, when, codex, regius, was, discovered, it, seemed, that, the, speculation, had, proved, correct, but, modern, scholarly, research, has, shown, that, the, prose, edda, was, likely, written, first, and, that, the, two, were, at, most, connected, by, a, common, source, brynj, lfur, attributed, the, manuscript, to, s, mundr, the, learned, a, larger, than, life, 12th, century, icelandic, priest, modern, scholars, reject, that, attribution, but, the, name, s, mundar, edda, is, still, sometimes, associated, with, both, the, codex, regius, and, versions, of, the, poetic, edda, using, it, as, a, source, bishop, brynj, lfur, sent, the, manuscript, as, a, present, to, the, danish, king, hence, the, latin, name, codex, regius, lit, royal, book, for, centuries, it, was, stored, in, the, royal, library, in, copenhagen, but, in, 1971, it, was, returned, to, iceland, because, air, travel, at, the, time, was, not, entirely, trustworthy, with, such, precious, cargo, it, was, transported, by, ship, accompanied, by, a, naval, escort, the, eddic, poems, are, composed, in, alliterative, verse, most, are, in, fornyr, islag, old, story, metre, while, m, lah, ttr, speech, form, is, a, common, variation, the, rest, about, a, quarter, are, composed, in, lj, ah, ttr, song, form, the, language, of, the, poems, is, usually, clear, and, relatively, unadorned, kennings, are, often, employed, though, they, do, not, arise, as, frequently, nor, are, they, as, complex, as, those, found, in, typical, skaldic, poetry, like, most, early, poetry, the, eddic, poems, were, minstrel, poems, passed, orally, from, singer, to, singer, and, from, poet, to, poet, for, centuries, none, of, the, poems, are, attributed, to, a, particular, author, though, many, of, them, show, strong, individual, characteristics, and, are, likely, to, have, been, the, work, of, individual, poets, while, scholars, have, speculated, on, hypothetical, authors, firm, and, accepted, conclusions, have, never, been, reached, accurate, dating, of, the, poems, has, long, been, a, source, of, scholarly, debate, firm, conclusions, are, difficult, to, reach, lines, from, the, eddic, poems, sometimes, appear, in, poems, by, known, poets, for, example, eyvindr, sk, ldaspillir, composed, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 10th, century, and, he, uses, a, couple, of, lines, in, his, h, konarm, l, that, are, also, found, in, h, vam, l, it, is, possible, that, he, was, quoting, a, known, poem, but, it, is, also, possible, that, h, vam, l, or, at, least, the, strophe, in, question, is, the, younger, derivative, work, the, few, demonstrably, historical, characters, mentioned, in, the, poems, such, as, attila, provide, a, terminus, post, quem, of, sorts, the, dating, of, the, manuscripts, themselves, provides, a, more, useful, terminus, ante, quem, individual, poems, have, individual, clues, to, their, age, for, example, atlam, l, hin, groenlenzku, is, claimed, by, its, title, to, have, been, composed, in, greenland, and, seems, so, by, some, internal, evidence, if, so, it, must, have, been, composed, no, earlier, than, about, 985, since, there, were, no, scandinavians, in, greenland, until, that, time, more, certain, than, such, circumstantial, evidence, are, linguistic, dating, criteria, these, can, be, arrived, at, by, looking, at, skaldic, poems, whose, dates, are, more, firmly, known, for, instance, the, particle, of, corresponding, to, ga, or, ge, in, other, old, germanic, languages, has, been, shown, to, occur, more, frequently, in, skaldic, poems, of, earlier, date, applying, this, criterion, to, eddic, poetry, bjarne, fidjest, l, found, large, variation, indicating, that, some, of, the, poems, were, much, older, than, others, other, dating, criteria, include, the, use, of, the, negative, adverb, eigi, not, and, alliteration, of, vr, with, v, in, western, dialects, of, old, norse, the, former, became, r, around, the, year, 1000, but, in, some, eddic, poems, the, word, vrei, r, younger, form, rei, r, is, seen, to, alliterate, with, words, beginning, in, an, original, v, this, was, observed, already, by, olaf, white, skald, thordarson, the, author, of, the, third, grammatical, treatise, who, termed, this, v, before, r, the, vindandin, forna, the, ancient, use, of, vend, in, some, cases, old, poems, may, have, been, interpolated, with, younger, verses, or, merged, with, other, poems, for, example, stanzas, 9, 16, of, v, lusp, the, dvergatal, or, roster, of, dwarfs, is, considered, by, some, scholars, to, be, an, interpolation, the, problem, of, dating, the, poems, is, linked, with, the, problem, of, determining, where, they, were, composed, iceland, was, not, settled, until, approximately, 870, so, anything, composed, before, that, time, would, necessarily, have, been, elsewhere, most, likely, in, scandinavia, more, recent, poems, on, the, other, hand, are, likely, icelandic, in, origin, scholars, have, attempted, to, localize, individual, poems, by, studying, the, geography, flora, and, fauna, to, which, they, refer, this, approach, usually, does, not, yield, firm, results, for, example, there, are, no, wolves, in, iceland, but, we, can, be, sure, that, icelandic, poets, were, familiar, with, the, species, similarly, the, apocalyptic, descriptions, of, v, lusp, have, been, taken, as, evidence, that, the, poet, who, composed, it, had, seen, a, volcanic, eruption, in, iceland, but, this, is, hardly, certain, poems, similar, to, those, found, in, the, codex, regius, are, also, included, in, many, editions, of, the, poetic, edda, important, manuscripts, containing, these, other, poems, include, am, 748, i, 4to, hauksb, k, and, flateyjarb, k, many, of, the, poems, are, also, quoted, in, snorri, s, prose, edda, but, usually, only, in, bits, and, pieces, what, poems, are, included, in, an, edition, of, the, poetic, edda, depends, on, the, editor, those, not, found, in, the, codex, regius, are, sometimes, called, the, eddic, appendix, other, eddic, like, poems, not,
