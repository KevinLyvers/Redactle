is, much, like, that, almost, deified, drawing, by, a, painter, gripped, by, religious, terror, of, a, formidable, sea, that, surrounded, his, country, a, drawing, that, shows, angry, ascent, to, the, sky, the, deep, azure, of, the, curl, s, transparent, interior, the, tearing, of, its, crest, that, scatters, in, a, shower, of, droplets, in, the, form, of, an, animal, s, claws, the, wave, is, generally, described, as, that, produced, by, a, tsunami, a, giant, wave, or, more, likely, a, rogue, wave, but, also, as, a, monstrous, or, ghostly, wave, like, a, white, skeleton, threatening, the, fishermen, with, its, claws, of, foam, this, interpretation, of, the, work, recalls, hokusai, s, mastery, of, japanese, fantasy, which, is, evidenced, by, the, ghosts, in, his, hokusai, manga, an, examination, of, the, wave, on, the, left, side, reveals, many, more, claws, that, are, ready, to, seize, the, fishermen, behind, the, white, foam, strip, this, image, recalls, many, of, hokusai, s, previous, works, including, his, hyaku, monogatari, series, one, hundred, ghost, stories, produced, from, 1831, to, 1832, which, more, explicitly, depicts, supernatural, themes, the, wave, s, silhouette, resembles, that, of, a, dragon, which, the, author, frequently, depicts, even, on, mount, fuji, the, great, wave, off, kanagawa, has, two, inscriptions, the, title, of, the, series, is, written, in, the, upper, left, corner, within, a, rectangular, frame, which, reads, fugaku, sanj, rokkei, kanagawa, oki, nami, ura, meaning, thirty, six, views, of, mount, fuji, on, the, high, seas, in, kanagawa, under, the, wave, the, inscription, to, the, left, of, the, box, bears, the, artist, s, signature, hokusai, aratame, iitsu, hitsu, which, reads, as, painting, from, the, brush, of, hokusai, who, changed, his, name, to, iitsu, due, to, his, humble, origins, hokusai, had, no, surname, his, first, nickname, katsushika, was, derived, from, the, region, he, came, from, throughout, his, career, hokusai, used, over, 30, names, and, never, started, a, new, cycle, of, work, without, changing, his, name, sometimes, leaving, his, name, to, his, students, depth, and, perspective, uki,

great, wave, contrasts, with, the, serenity, of, the, empty, background, evoking, the, yin, and, yang, symbol, man, powerless, struggles, between, the, two, which, may, be, a, reference, to, buddhism, in, which, man, made, things, are, ephemeral, as, represented, by, the, boats, being, swept, away, by, the, giant, wave, and, shintoism, in, which, nature, is, omnipotent, according, to, some, the, great, wave, off, kanagawa, is, best, viewed, from, right, to, left, this, is, traditional, for, japanese, paintings, as, japanese, script, is, also, read, from, right, to, left, analyzing, the, boats, in, the, image, particularly, that, at, the, top, reveals, the, slender, tapering, bow, faces, left, implying, the, japanese, interpretation, is, correct, the, boats, appearances, can, also, be, analysed, in, hokusai, s, print, s, sh, ch, shi, from, the, series, chie, no, umi, oceans, of, wisdom, in, which, the, boat, moves, against, the, current, in, a, rightward, direction, as, shown, by, the, boat, s, wake, hokusai, faced, numerous, challenges, during, the, composition, of, the, great, wave, off, kanagawa, in, 1826, whilst, in, his, sixties, he, suffered, financial, difficulty, and, in, 1827, apparently, suffered, a, serious, health, problem, probably, a, stroke, his, wife, died, the, following, year, and, in, 1829, he, had, to, rescue, his, grandson, from, financial, problems, a, situation, that, pushed, hokusai, into, poverty, despite, sending, his, grandson, to, the, countryside, with, his, father, in, 1830, the, financial, ramifications, continued, for, several, years, during, which, time, he, was, working, on, thirty, six, views, of, mount, fuji, cartwright, and, nakamura, 2009, interpret, hokusai, s, tribulations, as, the, source, of, the, series, powerful, and, innovative, imagery, hokusai, s, goal, for, the, series, appears, to, have, been, depicting, the, contrast, between, the, sacred, mount, fuji, and, secular, life, after, several, years, of, work, and, other, drawings, hokusai, arrived, at, the, final, design, for, the, great, wave, off, kanagawa, in, late, 1831, two, similar, works, from, around, 30, years, before, the, publication, of, the, great, wave, can, be, considered, forerunners, kanagawa, oki, honmoku, no, zu, and, oshiokuri, hato, tsusen, no, zu, both, of, which, depict, a, boat, a, sailing, boat, in, the, former, and, a, rowing, boat, in, the, latter, in, the, midst, of, a, storm, and, at, the, base, of, a, great, wave, that, threatens, to, engulf, them, the, great, wave, off, kanagawa, demonstrates, hokusai, s, drawing, skill, the, print, though, simple, in, appearance, to, the, viewer, is, the, result, of, a, lengthy, process, of, methodical, reflection, hokusai, established, the, foundations, of, this, method, in, his, 1812, book, quick, lessons, in, simplified, drawing, in, which, he, explains, that, any, object, can, be, drawn, using, the, relationship, between, the, circle, and, the, square, the, book, consists, of, showing, the, technique, of, drawing, using, only, a, ruler, and, a, compass, this, method, starts, with, a, line, and, the, most, naturally, obtained, proportion, he, continues, in, the, book, s, preface, all, forms, have, their, own, dimensions, which, we, must, respect, it, must, not, be, forgotten, that, such, things, belong, to, a, universe, whose, harmony, we, must, not, break, hokusai, returned, to, the, image, of, the, great, wave, a, few, years, later, when, he, produced, kaijo, no, fuji, for, the, second, volume, of, one, hundred, views, of, fuji, this, print, features, the, same, relationship, between, the, wave, and, the, mountain, and, the, same, burst, of, foam, there, are, no, humans, or, boats, in, the, latter, image, and, the, wave, fragments, coincide, with, the, flight, of, birds, while, the, wave, in, the, great, wave, moves, in, the, opposite, direction, of, the, japanese, reading, from, right, to, left, the, wave, and, birds, in, kaijo, no, fuji, move, in, unison, the, concept, of, perspective, prints, arrived, in, japan, in, the, 18th, century, these, prints, rely, on, a, single, point, perspective, rather, than, a, traditional, foreground, middle, ground, and, background, which, hokusai, consistently, rejected, objects, in, traditional, japanese, painting, and, far, eastern, painting, in, general, were, not, drawn, in, perspective, but, rather, as, in, ancient, egypt, the, sizes, of, objects, and, figures, were, determined, by, the, subject, s, importance, within, the, context, perspective, which, was, first, used, in, western, paintings, by, 15th, century, artists, paolo, uccello, and, piero, della, francesca, was, introduced, to, japanese, artists, through, western, particularly, dutch, merchants, arriving, in, nagasaki, okumura, masanobu, and, especially, utagawa, toyoharu, made, the, first, attempts, to, imitate, the, use, of, western, perspective, producing, engravings, depicting, the, canals, of, venice, or, the, ruins, of, ancient, rome, in, perspective, as, early, as, 1750, toyoharu, s, work, greatly, influenced, japanese, landscape, painting, which, evolved, with, the, works, of, hiroshige, an, indirect, student, of, toyoharu, through, toyohiro, and, hokusai, hokusai, became, acquainted, with, western, perspective, in, the, 1790s, through, shiba, k, kan, s, investigations, from, whose, teaching, he, benefited, between, 1805, and, 1810, hokusai, published, the, series, mirror, of, dutch, pictures, eight, views, of, edo, the, great, wave, off, kanagawa, would, not, have, been, as, successful, in, the, west, if, audiences, did, not, have, a, sense, of, familiarity, with, the, work, it, has, been, interpreted, as, a, western, play, seen, through, the, eyes, of, a, japanese, according, to, richard, lane, western, students, first, seeing, japanese, prints, almost, invariably, settle, upon, these, two, late, masters, as, representing, the, pinnacle, of, japanese, art, little, realizing, that, part, of, what, they, admire, is, the, hidden, kinship, they, feel, to, their, own, western, tradition, ironically, enough, it, was, this, very, work, of, hokusai, and, hiroshige, that, helped, to, revitalize, western, painting, toward, the, end, of, the, nineteenth, century, through, the, admiration, of, the, impressionists, and, post, impressionists, during, the, 1830s, hokusai, s, prints, underwent, a, blue, revolution, in, which, he, made, extensive, use, of, the, dark, blue, pigment, prussian, blue, he, used, this, shade, of, blue, for, the, great, wave, off, kanagawa, with, indigo, the, delicate, quickly, fading, shade, of, blue, that, was, commonly, used, in, ukiyo, e, works, at, the, time, prussian, blue, also, known, in, japanese, at, the, time, as, berlin, ai, abbreviated, to, bero, ai, literally, berlin, indigo, was, imported, from, holland, beginning, in, 1820, and, was, extensively, used, by, hiroshige, and, hokusai, after, its, arrival, in, japan, in, large, quantities, in, 1829, the, first, 10, prints, in, the, series, including, the, great, wave, off, kanagawa, are, among, the, first, japanese, prints, to, feature, prussian, blue, which, was, most, likely, suggested, to, the, publisher, in, 1830, this, innovation, was, an, immediate, success, in, early, january, 1831, hokusai, s, publisher, nishimuraya, yohachi, eijud, widely, advertised, the, innovation, and, the, following, year, published, the, next, 10, prints, in, the, thirty, six, views, of, mount, fuji, series, and, unique, for, their, predominantly, blue, aizuri, e, style, with, k, sh, kajikazawa, kajikazawa, in, kai, province, being, a, notable, example, in, addition, to, the, extensive, use, of, prussian, blue, the, outlines, on, these, 10, supplementary, prints, known, collectively, as, ura, fuji, fuji, seen, from, behind, are, sumi, black, with, india, ink, about, 1, 000, copies, of, the, great, wave, off, kanagawa, were, initially, printed, resulting, in, wear, in, later, editions, of, print, copies, it, is, estimated, approximately, 8, 000, copies, were, eventually, printed, as, of, 2022, about, 100, copies, are, known, to, survive, the, first, signs, of, wear, are, in, the, pink, and, yellow, of, the, sky, which, fades, more, in, worn, copies, resulting, in, vanishing, clouds, a, more, uniform, sky, and, broken, lines, around, the, box, containing, the, title, some, of, the, surviving, copies, have, been, damaged, by, light, as, woodblock, prints, of, the, edo, period, used, light, sensitive, colourants, collections,

in, the, metropolitan, museum, came, from, henry, osborne, havemeyer, s, former, collection, which, his, wife, donated, to, the, museum, in, 1929, the, copy, in, the, biblioth, que, nationale, de, france, came, from, the, collection, of, samuel, bing, in, 1888, and, the, copy, in, the, mus, e, guimet, is, a, bequest, from, raymond, koechlin, who, gave, it, to, the, museum, in, 1932, in, 2023, one, of, the, prints, that, had, been, held, by, a, private, family, since, the, early, 1900s, and, for, a, time, was, displayed, at, the, glyptotek, copenhagen, was, sold, for, a, record, price, 2, 8, million, dollars, after, the, 1868, meiji, restoration, japan, ended, a, long, period, of, isolation, and, opened, to, imports, from, the, west, in, turn, much, japanese, art, was, exported, to, europe, and, america, and, quickly, gained, popularity, the, influence, of, japanese, art, on, western, culture, became, known, as, japonisme, japanese, woodblock, prints, inspired, western, artists,

vincent, van, gogh, a, great, admirer, of, hokusai, praised, the, quality, of, drawing, and, use, of, line, in, the, great, wave, off, kanagawa, and, wrote, it, had, a, terrifying, emotional, impact,
