a, bell, is, a, directly, struck, idiophone, percussion, instrument, most, bells, have, the, shape, of, a, hollow, cup, that, when, struck, vibrates, in, a, single, strong, strike, tone, with, its, sides, forming, an, efficient, resonator, the, strike, may, be, made, by, an, internal, clapper, or, uvula, an, external, hammer, or, in, small, bells, by, a, small, loose, sphere, enclosed, within, the, body, of, the, bell, jingle, bell, bells, are, usually, cast, from, bell, metal, a, type, of, bronze, for, its, resonant, properties, but, can, also, be, made, from, other, hard, materials, this, depends, on, the, function, some, small, bells, such, as, ornamental, bells, or, cowbells, can, be, made, from, cast, or, pressed, metal, glass, or, ceramic, but, large, bells, such, as, a, church, clock, and, tower, bells, are, normally, cast, from, bell, metal, bells, intended, to, be, heard, over, a, wide, area, can, range, from, a, single, bell, hung, in, a, turret, or, bell, gable, to, a, musical, ensemble, such, as, an, english, ring, of, bells, a, carillon, or, a, russian, zvon, which, are, tuned, to, a, common, scale, and, installed, in, a, bell, tower, many, public, or, institutional, buildings, house, bells, most, commonly, as, clock, bells, to, sound, the, hours, and, quarters, historically, bells, have, been, associated, with, religious, rites, and, are, still, used, to, call, communities, together, for, religious, services, later, bells, were, made, to, commemorate, important, events, or, people, and, have, been, associated, with, the, concepts, of, peace, and, freedom, the, study, of, bells, is, called, campanology, bell, is, a, word, common, to, the, low, german, dialects, cognate, with, middle, low, german, belle, and, dutch, bel, but, not, appearing, among, the, other, germanic, languages, except, the, icelandic, bjalla, which, was, a, loanword, from, old, english, it, is, popularly, but, not, certainly, related, to, the, former, sense, of, to, bell, old, english, bellan, to, roar, to, make, a, loud, noise, which, gave, rise, to, bellow, the, earliest, archaeological, evidence, of, bells, dates, from, the, 3rd, millennium, bc, and, is, traced, to, the, yangshao, culture, of, neolithic, china, clapper, bells, made, of, pottery, have, been, found, in, several, archaeological, sites, the, pottery, bells, later, developed, into, metal, bells, in, west, asia, the, first, bells, appear, in, 1000, bc, the, earliest, metal, bells, with, one, found, in, the, taosi, site, and, four, in, the, erlitou, site, are, dated, to, about, 2000, bc, with, the, emergence, of, other, kinds, of, bells, during, the, shang, dynasty, c, 1600, c, 1050, bc, they, were, relegated, to, subservient, functions, at, shang, and, zhou, sites, they, are, also, found, as, part, of, the, horse, and, chariot, gear, and, as, collar, bells, of, dogs, by, the, 13th, century, bc, bells, weighing, over, 150, kilograms, 330, pounds, were, being, cast, in, china, after, 1000, ad, iron, became, the, most, commonly, used, metal, for, bells, instead, of, bronze, the, earliest, dated, iron, bell, was, manufactured, in, 1079, found, in, hubei, province, bells, west, of, china, did, not, reach, the, same, size, until, the, 2nd, millennium, ad, assyrian, bells, dated, to, the, 7th, century, bc, were, around, 4, inches, high, roman, bells, dated, to, the, 1st, and, 2nd, century, ad, were, around, 8, inches, high, the, book, of, exodus, in, the, bible, notes, that, small, gold, bells, were, worn, as, ornaments, on, the, hem, of, the, robe, of, the, high, priest, in, jerusalem, among, the, ancient, greeks, handbells, were, used, in, camps, and, garrisons, and, by, patrols, that, went, around, to, visit, sentinels, among, the, romans, the, hour, of, bathing, was, announced, by, a, bell, they, also, used, them, in, the, home, as, an, ornament, and, emblem, and, bells, were, placed, around, the, necks, of, cattle, and, sheep, so, they, could, be, found, if, they, strayed, as, late, as, the, 10th, century, ad, european, bells, were, no, higher, than, 2, feet, in, height, in, the, western, world, the, common, form, of, bell, is, a, church, bell, or, town, bell, which, is, hung, within, a, tower, or, bell, cote, such, bells, are, either, fixed, in, a, static, position, hung, dead, or, mounted, on, a, beam, the, headstock, so, they, can, swing, to, and, fro, bells, that, are, hung, dead, are, normally, sounded, by, hitting, the, sound, bow, with, a, hammer, or, occasionally, by, pulling, an, internal, clapper, against, the, bell, where, a, bell, is, swung, it, can, either, be, swung, over, a, small, arc, by, a, rope, and, lever, or, by, using, a, rope, on, a, wheel, to, swing, the, bell, higher, as, the, bell, swings, higher, the, sound, is, projected, outwards, rather, than, downwards, larger, bells, may, be, swung, using, electric, motors, in, some, places, such, as, the, salzburg, cathedral, the, clapper, is, held, against, the, sound, bow, with, an, electric, clasp, as, the, bell, swings, up, the, clasp, would, release, the, clapper, to, provide, a, cleaner, start, to, ringing, to, silence, the, bell, the, clasp, catches, and, locks, the, clapper, back, in, place, bells, hung, for, full, circle, ringing, are, swung, through, just, over, a, complete, circle, from, mouth, uppermost, a, stay, the, wooden, pole, seen, sticking, up, when, the, bells, are, down, engages, a, mechanism, to, allow, the, bell, to, rest, just, past, its, balance, point, the, rope, is, attached, to, one, side, of, a, wheel, so, that, a, different, amount, of, rope, is, wound, on, and, off, as, it, swings, to, and, fro, the, bells, are, controlled, by, ringers, one, to, a, bell, in, a, chamber, below, who, rotate, the, bell, to, through, a, full, circle, and, back, and, control, the, speed, of, oscillation, when, the, bell, is, mouth, upwards, at, the, balance, point, when, little, effort, is, required, swinging, bells, are, sounded, by, an, internal, clapper, the, clapper, may, have, a, longer, period, of, swing, than, the, bell, in, this, case, the, bell, will, catch, up, with, the, clapper, and, if, rung, to, or, near, full, circle, will, carry, the, clapper, up, on, the, bell, s, trailing, side, alternatively, the, clapper, may, have, a, shorter, period, and, catch, up, with, the, bell, s, leading, side, travel, up, with, the, bell, coming, to, rest, on, the, downhill, side, this, latter, method, is, used, in, english, style, full, circle, ringing, occasionally, the, clappers, have, leather, pads, called, muffles, strapped, around, them, to, quieten, the, bells, when, practice, ringing, to, avoid, annoying, the, neighbourhood, also, at, funerals, half, muffles, are, often, used, to, give, a, full, open, sound, on, one, round, and, a, muffled, sound, on, the, alternate, round, for, a, distinctive, mournful, effect, this, was, done, at, the, funeral, of, diana, princess, of, wales, in, 1997, a, carillon, which, is, a, musical, instrument, consisting, of, at, least, 23, cast, bronze, cup, shaped, bells, is, tuned, so, that, the, bells, can, be, played, serially, to, produce, a, melody, or, sounded, together, to, play, a, chord, a, traditional, carillon, is, played, by, striking, a, baton, keyboard, with, the, fists, and, by, pressing, the, keys, of, a, pedal, keyboard, with, the, feet, the, keys, mechanically, activate, levers, and, wires, that, connect, to, metal, clappers, that, strike, the, inside, of, the, bells, allowing, the, performer, to, vary, the, intensity, of, the, note, according, to, the, force, applied, to, the, key, in, the, eastern, world, the, traditional, forms, of, bells, are, temple, and, palace, bells, small, ones, being, rung, by, a, sharp, rap, with, a, stick, and, very, large, ones, rung, by, a, blow, from, the, outside, by, a, large, swinging, beam, see, images, of, the, great, bell, of, mii, dera, below, the, striking, technique, is, employed, worldwide, for, some, of, the, largest, tower, borne, bells, because, swinging, the, bells, themselves, could, damage, their, towers, in, the, roman, catholic, church, and, among, some, high, lutherans, and, anglicans, small, hand, held, bells, called, sanctus, or, sacring, bells, are, often, rung, by, a, server, at, mass, when, the, priest, holds, high, up, first, the, host, and, then, the, chalice, immediately, after, he, has, said, the, words, of, consecration, over, them, the, moment, known, as, the, elevation, this, serves, to, indicate, to, the, congregation, that, the, bread, and, wine, have, just, been, transformed, into, the, body, and, blood, of, christ, see, transubstantiation, or, in, the, alternative, reformation, teaching, that, christ, is, now, bodily, present, in, the, elements, and, that, what, the, priest, is, holding, up, for, them, to, look, at, is, christ, himself, see, consubstantiation, in, russian, orthodox, bell, ringing, the, entire, bell, never, moves, only, the, clapper, a, complex, system, of, ropes, is, developed, and, used, uniquely, for, every, bell, tower, some, ropes, the, smaller, ones, are, played, by, hand, the, bigger, ropes, are, played, by, foot, japanese, shintoist, and, buddhist, bells, are, used, in, religious, ceremonies, suzui, a, homophone, meaning, both, cool, and, refreshing, are, spherical, bells, which, contain, metal, pellets, that, produce, sound, from, the, inside, the, hemispherical, bell, is, the, kane, bell, which, is, struck, on, the, outside, large, suspended, temple, bells, are, known, as, bonsh, see, also, ja, ja, jain, hindu, and, buddhist, bells, called, ghanta, iast, gha, in, sanskrit, are, used, in, religious, ceremonies, see, also, singing, bowls, a, bell, hangs, at, the, gate, of, many, hindu, temples, and, is, rung, at, the, moment, one, enters, the, temple, the, process, of, casting, bells, is, called, bellfounding, and, in, europe, dates, to, the, 4th, or, 5th, century, the, traditional, metal, for, these, bells, is, a, bronze, of, about, 23, tin, known, as, bell, metal, this, alloy, is, also, the, traditional, alloy, for, the, finest, turkish, and, chinese, cymbals, other, materials, sometimes, used, for, large, bells, include, brass, and, iron, steel, was, tried, during, the, busy, church, building, period, of, mid, 19th, century, england, because, it, was, more, economical, than, bronze, but, was, found, not, to, be, durable, and, manufacture, ceased, in, the, 1870s, small, bells, were, originally, made, with, the, lost, wax, process, but, large, bells, are, cast, mouth, downwards, by, filling, the, air, space, in, a, two, part, mould, with, molten, metal, such, a, mould, has, an, outer, section, clamped, to, a, base, plate, on, which, an, inner, core, has, been, constructed, the, core, is, built, on, the, base, plate, using, porous, materials, such, as, coke, or, brick, and, then, covered, in, loam, well, mixed, with, straw, and, horse, manure, this, is, given, a, profile, corresponding, to, the, inside, shape, of, the, finished, bell, and, dried, with, gentle, heat, graphite, and, whiting, are, applied, to, form, the, final, smooth, surface, the, outside, of, the, mould, is, made, within, a, perforated, cast, iron, case, larger, than, the, finished, bell, containing, the, loam, mixture, which, is, shaped, dried, and, smoothed, in, the, same, way, as, the, core, the, case, is, inverted, mouth, down, lowered, over, the, core, and, clamped, to, the, base, plate, the, clamped, mould, is, supported, usually, by, being, buried, in, a, casting, pit, to, bear, the, weight, of, metal, and, to, allow, even, cooling, historically, before, rail, or, road, transport, of, large, bells, was, possible, a, bell, pit, was, often, dug, in, the, grounds, of, the, building, where, the, bell, was, to, be, installed, molten, bell, metal, is, poured, into, the, mould, through, a, box, lined, with, foundry, sand, the, founder, would, bring, his, casting, tools, to, the, site, and, a, furnace, would, be, built, next, to, the, pit, large, bells, are, generally, around, 80, copper, and, 20, tin, bell, metal, which, has, been, found, empirically, to, give, the, most, pleasant, tone, however, the, tone, of, a, bell, is, mostly, due, to, its, shape, a, bell, is, regarded, as, having, a, good, tone, when, it, s, in, tune, with, itself, in, western, bell, founding, this, is, known, as, harmonic, tuning, of, a, bell, which, results, in, the, bell, s, strongest, harmonics, being, in, harmony, with, each, other, and, the, strike, note, this, produces, the, brightest, and, purest, sound, which, is, the, attractive, sound, of, a, good, bell, a, huge, amount, of, effort, has, been, expended, over, the, centuries, in, finding, the, shape, which, will, produce, the, harmonically, tuned, bell, the, accompanying, musical, staves, show, the, series, of, harmonics, which, are, generated, when, a, bell, is, struck, the, erfurt, bell, is, notable, that, it, although, it, is, an, old, bell, it, is, harmonically, tuned, but, was, not, typical, of, its, time, pieter, and, fran, ois, hemony, in, the, 17th, century, reliably, cast, many, bells, for, carillons, of, unequalled, quality, of, tuning, for, the, time, but, after, their, death, their, guarded, trade, secrets, were, lost, and, not, until, the, 19th, century, were, bells, of, comparable, tuning, quality, cast, it, was, only, in, modern, times, that, repeatable, harmonic, tuning, using, a, known, scientific, basis, was, achieved, the, main, partials, or, harmonics, of, a, well, tuned, bell, are, further, less, audible, harmonics, include, the, major, third, and, a, perfect, fifth, in, the, second, octave, above, the, named, note, this, quest, by, various, founders, over, centuries, of, bell, founding, has, resulted, in, the, development, of, an, optimum, profile, for, casting, each, size, of, a, bell, to, give, true, harmonic, tuning, although, bells, are, cast, to, accurate, patterns, variations, in, casting, mean, that, a, final, tuning, is, necessary, as, the, shape, of, the, bell, is, critical, in, producing, the, desired, strike, note, and, associated, harmonics, tuning, is, undertaken, by, clamping, the, bell, on, a, large, rotating, table, and, using, a, cutting, tool, to, remove, metal, this, is, an, iterative, process, in, which, metal, is, removed, from, certain, parts, of, the, bell, to, change, certain, harmonics, this, process, was, made, possible, historically, by, the, use, of, tuning, forks, to, find, sympathetic, resonance, on, specific, parts, of, a, bell, for, the, harmonic, being, tuned, but, today, electronic, strobe, tuners, are, normally, used, to, tune, the, strike, note, the, nominal, or, the, strike, note, are, tuned, the, effect, is, usually, the, same, because, the, nominal, is, one, of, the, main, partials, that, determines, the, tone, of, the, strike, note, the, thickness, of, a, church, bell, at, its, thickest, part, called, the, sound, bow, is, usually, one, thirteenth, its, diameter, if, the, bell, is, mounted, as, cast, it, is, called, a, maiden, bell, the, traditional, harmonically, tuned, bell, has, a, minor, third, as, a, main, harmonic, on, the, theory, that, western, music, in, major, keys, may, sound, better, on, bells, with, a, major, third, as, a, harmonic, production, of, bells, with, major, thirds, was, attempted, in, the, 1980s, scientists, at, the, technical, university, in, eindhoven, using, computer, modelling, produced, bell, profiles, which, were, cast, by, the, eijsbouts, bellfoundry, in, the, netherlands, they, were, described, as, resembling, old, coke, bottles, in, that, they, had, a, bulge, around, the, middle, in, 1999, a, design, without, the, bulge, was, announced, however, the, major, bell, concept, has, found, little, favour, most, bells, cast, today, are, almost, universally, minor, third, bells, bells, are, also, associated, with, clocks, indicating, the, hour, by, the, striking, of, bells, indeed, the, word, clock, comes, from, the, latin, word, cloca, meaning, bell, bells, in, clock, towers, or, bell, towers, can, be, heard, over, long, distances, which, was, especially, important, in, the, time, when, clocks, were, too, expensive, for, widespread, ownership, in, the, case, of, clock, towers, and, grandfather, clocks, a, particular, sequence, of, tones, may, be, played, to, distinguish, between, the, hour, half, hour, quarter, hour, or, other, intervals, one, common, pattern, is, called, westminster, quarters, a, sixteen, note, pattern, named, after, the, palace, of, westminster, which, popularized, it, as, the, measure, used, by, big, ben, some, bells, are, used, as, musical, instruments, such, as, carillons, clock, chimes, agog, or, ensembles, of, bell, players, called, bell, choirs, using, hand, held, bells, of, varying, tones, a, ring, of, bells, is, a, set, of, four, to, twelve, or, more, bells, used, in, change, ringing, a, particular, method, of, ringing, bells, in, patterns, a, peal, in, changing, ringing, may, have, bells, playing, for, several, hours, playing, 5, 000, or, more, patterns, without, a, break, or, repetition, they, have, also, been, used, in, many, kinds, of, popular, music, such, as, in, ac, dc, s, hells, bells, and, metallica, s, for, whom, the, bell, tolls, the, ancient, chinese, bronze, chime, bells, called, bianzhong, or, zhong, zeng, were, used, as, polyphonic, musical, instruments, and, some, have, been, dated, at, between, 2000, and, 3600, years, old, tuned, bells, have, been, created, and, used, for, musical, performance, in, many, cultures, but, zhong, are, unique, among, all, other, types, of, cast, bells, in, several, respects, and, they, rank, among, the, highest, achievements, of, chinese, bronze, casting, technology, however, the, remarkable, secret, of, their, design, and, the, method, of, casting, known, only, to, the, chinese, in, antiquity, was, lost, in, later, generations, and, was, not, fully, rediscovered, and, understood, until, the, 20th, century, in, 1978, a, complete, ceremonial, set, of, 65, zhong, bells, was, found, in, a, near, perfect, state, of, preservation, during, the, excavation, of, the, tomb, of, marquis, yi, ruler, of, zeng, one, of, the, warring, states, their, special, shape, gives, them, the, ability, to, produce, two, different, musical, tones, depending, on, where, they, are, struck, the, interval, between, these, notes, on, each, bell, is, either, a, major, or, minor, third, equivalent, to, a, distance, of, four, or, five, notes, on, a, piano, the, bells, of, marquis, yi, which, were, still, fully, playable, after, almost, 2500, years, cover, a, range, of, slightly, less, than, five, octaves, but, thanks, to, their, dual, tone, capability, the, set, can, sound, a, complete, 12, tone, scale, predating, the, development, of, the, european, 12, tone, system, by, some, 2000, years, and, can, play, melodies, in, diatonic, and, pentatonic, scales, another, related, ancient, chinese, musical, instrument, is, called, qing, pinyin, q, ng, but, it, was, made, of, stone, instead, of, metal, in, more, recent, times, the, top, of, bells, in, china, was, usually, decorated, with, a, small, dragon, known, as, pulao, the, figure, of, the, dragon, served, as, a, hook, for, hanging, the, bell, konguro, o, is, a, small, bell, which, like, the, djalaajyn, was, first, used, for, utilitarian, purposes, and, only, later, for, artistic, ones, konguro, o, rang, when, moving, to, new, places, they, were, fastened, to, the, horse, harnesses, and, created, a, very, specific, smart, sound, background, konguro, o, also, hung, on, the, neck, of, the, leader, goat, which, the, sheep, herd, followed, this, led, to, the, association, in, folk, memory, between, the, distinctive, sound, of, konguro, o, and, the, nomadic, way, of, life, to, make, this, instrument, kyrgyz, foremen, used, copper, bronze, iron, and, brass, they, also, decorated, it, with, artistic, carving, and, covered, it, with, silver, sizes, of, the, instruments, might, vary, within, certain, limits, what, depended, on, its, function, every, bell, had, its, own, timbre, a, variant, on, the, bell, is, the, tubular, bell, several, of, these, metal, tubes, which, are, struck, manually, with, hammers, form, an, instrument, named, tubular, bells, or, chimes, in, the, case, of, wind, or, aeolian, chimes, the, tubes, are, blown, against, one, another, by, the, wind, the, skrabalai, is, a, traditional, folk, instrument, in, lithuania, which, consists, of, wooden, bells, of, various, sizes, hanging, in, several, vertical, rows, with, one, or, two, wooden, or, metal, small, clappers, hanging, inside, them, it, is, played, with, two, wooden, sticks, when, the, skrabalai, is, moved, a, clapper, knocks, at, the, wall, of, the, trough, the, pitch, of, the, sound, depends, on, the, size, of, the, wooden, trough, the, instrument, developed, from, wooden, cowbells, that, shepherds, would, tie, to, cows, necks, whereas, the, church, and, temple, bells, called, to, mass, or, religious, service, bells, were, used, on, farms, for, more, secular, signalling, the, greater, farms, in, scandinavia, usually, had, a, small, bell, tower, resting, on, the, top, of, the, barn, the, bell, was, used, to, call, the, workers, from, the, field, at, the, end, of, the, day, s, work, in, folk, tradition, it, is, recorded, that, each, church, and, possibly, several, farms, had, their, specific, rhymes, connected, to, the, sound, of, the, specific, bells, an, example, is, the, pete, seeger, and, idris, davies, song, the, bells, of, rhymney, in, scotland, up, until, the, nineteenth, century, it, was, the, tradition, to, ring, a, dead, bell, a, form, of, handbell, at, the, death, of, an, individual, and, at, the, funeral, the, following, organizations, promote, the, ringing, study, music, collection, preservation, and, restoration, of, bells, nation, s, covered, are, given, in, parentheses
