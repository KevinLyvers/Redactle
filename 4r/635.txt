two, weeks, they, managed, to, see, approximately, seventy, five, locations, an, experience, that, helped, lehman, conceptualize, several, important, sequences, during, that, trip, lehman, began, to, have, reservations, about, wyler, s, commitment, to, the, project, and, communicated, this, to, zanuck, who, instructed, the, writer, to, finalize, the, first, draft, of, the, screenplay, as, quickly, as, possible, lehman, completed, the, first, draft, on, september, 10, 1963, and, sent, it, to, wyler, who, had, no, suggestions, or, changes, to, add, at, that, time, lehman, also, secretly, gave, a,

ending, wyler, s, participation, meanwhile, wise, whose, film, the, sand, pebbles, had, been, postponed, read, lehman, s, first, draft, was, impressed, by, what, he, read, and, agreed, to, direct, the, film, joining, the, picture, in, october, 1963, and, flew, to, salzburg, with, associate, producer, saul, chaplin, and, members, of, his, production, team, to, scout, filming, locations, including, many, that, wyler, had, identified, when, he, returned, wise, began, working, on, the, script, wise, shared, lehman, s, vision, of, the, film, being, centered, on, the, music, and, the, changes, he, made, were, consistent, with, the, writer, s, approach, mainly, reducing, the, amount, of, sweetness, and, sentimentality, found, in, the, stage, musical, he, had, reservations, about, lehman, s, opening, aerial, sequence, because, west, side, story, whose, screenplay, lehman, had, also, written, had, used, a, similar, opening, sequence, but, he, was, unable, to, think, of, a, better, one, and, decided, to, keep, lehman, s, other, changes, included, replacing, an, ordinary, couple, with, a, more, romantic, number, and, a, new, song, for, maria, s, departure, from, the,

made, based, on, input, from, maria, von, trapp, and, christopher, plummer, about, the, character, of, the, captain, plummer, especially, helped, change, a, character, lacking, substance, into, a, stronger, more, forceful, complex, figure, with, a, wry, sense, of, humor, and, a, darker, edge, lehman, completed, his, final, draft, on, march, 20, 1964, lehman, s, first, and, only, choice, for, maria, was, julie, andrews, when, wise, joined, the, project, he, made, a, list, of, his, choices, for, the, role, which, included, andrews, as, his, first, choice, grace, kelly, and, shirley, jones, wise, and, lehman, went, to, disney, studios, to, view, footage, from, mary, poppins, which, was, not, yet, released, a, few, minutes, into, the, film, wise, told, lehman, let, s, go, sign, this, girl, before, somebody, else, sees, this, film, and, grabs, her, andrews, had, some, reservations, mainly, about, the, amount, of, sweetness, in, the, theatrical, version, but, when, she, learned, that, her, concerns, were, shared, by, wise, and, lehman, and, what, their, vision, was, she, signed, a, contract, with, fox, to, star, in, the, sound, of, music, and, one, other, film, for, 225, 000,

opening, of, west, side, story, and, saw, the, musical, as, a, fairy, tale, that, s, almost, real, the, film, incorporated, many, fairy, tale, tropes, which, included, the, idyllic, imagery, in, the, hills, of, salzburg, the, european, villas, and, the, cross, class, cinderella, like, romance, between, maria, and, captain, von, trapp, as, maria, walks, down, the, aisle, to, be, married, the, pageantry, is, explicitly, both, guinevere, and, cinderella, in, keeping, with, this, tone, the, filmmakers, used, artistic, license, to, convey, the, essence, and, meaning, of, their, story, georg, ludwig, von, trapp, was, indeed, an, anti, nazi, opposed, to, the, anschluss, and, he, lived, with, his, family, in, a, villa, in, a, district, of, salzburg, called, aigen, their, lifestyle, depicted, in, the, film, however, greatly, exaggerated, their, standard, of, living, the, actual, family, villa, located, at, traunstra, e, 34, aigen, 5026, was, large, and, comfortable, but, not, nearly, as, grand, as, the, mansion, depicted, in, the, film, the, house, was, also, not, their, ancestral, home, as, depicted, in, the, film, the, family, had, previously, lived, in, homes, in, zell, am, see, and, klosterneuburg, after, being, forced, to, abandon, their, actual, ancestral, home, in, pula, following, world, war, i, georg, moved, the, family, to, the, salzburg, villa, shortly, after, the, death, of, his, wife, agathe, whitehead, in, 1922, georg, is, referred, to, as, captain, in, the, film, but, he, held, a, noble, title, of, ritter, hereditary, knight, which, had, higher, social, status, than, a, naval, officer, austrian, nobility, was, legally, abolished, in, 1919, and, the, title, von, was, proscribed, however, both, continued, to, be, widely, used, unofficially, as, a, matter, of, social, courtesy, georg, was, offered, a, position, in, the, german, kriegsmarine, nazi, germany, was, looking, to, expand, its, fleet, of, u, boats, and, korvettenk, pitan, lieutenant, commander, von, trapp, was, the, most, successful, austro, hungarian, submarine, commander, of, world, war, i, having, sunk, 11, allied, merchant, ships, totaling, 47, 653, grt, and, two, allied, warships, displacing, a, total, of, 12, 641, tons, with, his, family, in, desperate, financial, straits, he, seriously, considered, the, offer, before, deciding, that, he, could, not, serve, a, nazi, regime, georg, is, depicted, in, the, film, as, a, humorless, emotionally, distant, father, in, reality, third, child, maria, franziska, von, trapp, called, louisa, in, the, film, described, her, father, as, a, doting, parent, who, made, handmade, gifts, for, the, children, in, his, woodshop, and, who, would, often, lead, family, musicales, on, his, violin, she, has, a, different, recollection, of, her, stepmother, maria, augusta, kutschera, whom, she, described, as, moody, and, prone, to, outbursts, of, rage, in, a, 2003, interview, maria, remembered, that, she, had, a, terrible, temper, and, from, one, moment, to, the, next, you, didn, t, know, what, hit, her, we, were, not, used, to, this, but, we, took, it, like, a, thunderstorm, that, would, pass, because, the, next, minute, she, could, be, very, nice, maria, kutschera, had, indeed, been, a, novice, at, nonnberg, abbey, in, salzburg, and, had, been, hired, by, the, von, trapp, family, however, she, was, hired, only, to, be, a, tutor, to, young, maria, franziska, who, had, contracted, scarlet, fever, and, needed, her, lessons, at, home, she, was, not, hired, to, be, a, governess, to, all, of, the, children, maria, and, georg, married, for, practical, reasons, rather, than, love, and, affection, for, each, other, georg, needed, a, mother, for, his, children, and, maria, needed, the, security, of, a, husband, and, family, once, she, decided, to, leave, the, abbey, i, really, and, truly, was, not, in, love, maria, wrote, in, her, memoir, i, liked, him, but, didn, t, love, him, however, i, loved, the, children, so, in, a, way, i, really, married, the, children, i, learned, to, love, him, more, than, i, have, ever, loved, before, or, after, they, were, married, in, 1927, not, in, 1938, as, depicted, in, the, film, they, had, been, married, for, over, a, decade, by, the, time, of, the, anschluss, and, had, two, of, their, three, children, together, by, that, time, maria, and, georg, enjoyed, a, happy, marriage, the, von, trapp, family, lost, most, of, its, wealth, during, the, worldwide, depression, of, the, early, 1930s, when, the, austrian, national, bank, folded, in, order, to, survive, the, family, dismissed, the, servants, and, began, taking, in, boarders, they, also, started, singing, onstage, to, earn, money, a, fact, that, caused, the, proud, georg, much, embarrassment, in, the, film, the, von, trapp, family, hike, over, the, alps, from, austria, to, switzerland, to, escape, the, nazis, which, would, not, have, been, possible, salzburg, is, over, two, hundred, miles, from, switzerland, the, von, trapp, villa, however, was, only, a, few, kilometers, from, the, austria, germany, border, and, the, final, scene, shows, the, family, hiking, on, the, obersalzberg, near, the, german, town, of, berchtesgaden, within, sight, of, adolf, hitler, s, kehlsteinhaus, eagle, s, nest, retreat, in, reality, the, family, simply, walked, to, the, local, train, station, and, boarded, a, train, to, italy, from, which, they, travelled, to, switzerland, france, and, london, the, trapps, were, entitled, to, italian, citizenship, since, georg, had, been, born, in, zadar, dalmatia, austria, hungary, which, had, been, annexed, by, italy, after, world, war, i, from, london, they, emigrated, to, the, united, states, on, their, italian, passports, the,
