which, bruce, wayne, s, vast, personal, wealth, is, important, in, his, life, story, and, the, crucial, role, it, plays, in, his, efforts, as, batman, will, brooker, notes, in, his, book, batman, unmasked, that, the, confirmation, of, the, batman, s, identity, lies, with, the, young, audience, he, doesn, t, have, to, be, bruce, wayne, he, just, needs, the, suit, and, gadgets, the, abilities, and, most, importantly, the, morality, the, humanity, there, s, just, a, sense, about, him, they, trust, him, and, they, re, never, wrong, batman, s, primary, character, traits, can, be, summarized, as, wealth, physical, prowess, deductive, abilities, and, obsession, the, details, and, tone, of, batman, comic, books, have, varied, over, the, years, with, different, creative, teams, dennis, o, neil, noted, that, character, consistency, was, not, a, major, concern, during, early, editorial, regimes, julie, schwartz, did, a, batman, in, batman, and, detective, and, murray, boltinoff, did, a, batman, in, the, brave, and, the, bold, and, apart, from, the, costume, they, bore, very, little, resemblance, to, each, other, julie, and, murray, did, not, want, to, coordinate, their, efforts, nor, were, they, asked, to, do, so, continuity, was, not, important, in, those, days, the, driving, force, behind, bruce, wayne, s, character, is, his, parents, murder, and, their, absence, bob, kane, and, bill, finger, discussed, batman, s, background, and, decided, that, there, s, nothing, more, traumatic, than, having, your, parents, murdered, before, your, eyes, despite, his, trauma, he, sets, his, mind, on, studying, to, become, a, scientist, and, to, train, his, body, into, physical, perfection, to, fight, crime, in, gotham, city, as, batman, an, inspired, idea, from, wayne, s, insight, into, the, criminal, mind, he, also, speaks, over, 40, languages, another, of, batman, s, characterizations, is, that, of, a, vigilante, in, order, to, stop, evil, that, started, with, the, death, of, his, parents, he, must, sometimes, break, the, law, himself, although, manifested, differently, by, being, re, told, by, different, artists, it, is, nevertheless, that, the, details, and, the, prime, components, of, batman, s, origin, have, never, varied, at, all, in, the, comic, books, the, reiteration, of, the, basic, origin, events, holds, together, otherwise, divergent, expressions, the, origin, is, the, source, of, the, character, s, traits, and, attributes, which, play, out, in, many, of, the, character, s, adventures, batman, is, often, treated, as, a, vigilante, by, other, characters, in, his, stories, frank, miller, views, the, character, as, a, dionysian, figure, a, force, for, anarchy, that, imposes, an, individual, order, dressed, as, a, bat, batman, deliberately, cultivates, a, frightening, persona, in, order, to, aid, him, in, crime, fighting, a, fear, that, originates, from, the, criminals, own, guilty, conscience, miller, is, often, credited, with, reintroducing, anti, heroic, traits, into, batman, s, characterization, such, as, his, brooding, personality, willingness, to, use, violence, and, torture, and, increasingly, alienated, behavior, batman, shortly, a, year, after, his, debut, and, the, introduction, of, robin, was, changed, in, 1940, after, dc, editor, whitney, ellsworth, felt, the, character, would, be, tainted, by, his, lethal, methods, and, dc, established, their, own, ethical, code, subsequently, he, was, retconned, to, have, a, stringent, moral, code, which, has, stayed, with, the, character, of, batman, ever, since, miller, s, batman, was, closer, to, the, original, pre, robin, version, who, was, willing, to, kill, criminals, if, necessary, on, several, occasions, former, robin, dick, grayson, has, served,
