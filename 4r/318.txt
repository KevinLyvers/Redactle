organ, mouth, blown, claviola, melodica, harmonica, laotian, khene, chinese, sh, ng, japanese, sh, electronic, reedless, instruments, accordions, from, 19th, century, german, akkordeon, from, akkord, musical, chord, concord, of, sounds, are, a, family, of, box, shaped, musical, instruments, of, the, bellows, driven, free, reed, aerophone, type, producing, sound, as, air, flows, past, a, reed, in, a, frame, the, essential, characteristic, of, the, accordion, is, to, combine, in, one, instrument, a, melody, section, also, called, the, diskant, usually, on, the, right, hand, keyboard, with, an, accompaniment, or, basso, continuo, functionality, on, the, left, hand, the, musician, normally, plays, the, melody, on, buttons, or, keys, on, the, right, hand, side, referred, to, as, the, keyboard, or, sometimes, the, manual, and, the, accompaniment, on, bass, or, pre, set, chord, buttons, on, the, left, hand, side, a, person, who, plays, the, accordion, is, called, an, accordionist, the, accordion, belongs, to, the, free, reed, aerophone, family, other, instruments, in, this, family, include, the, concertina, harmonica, and, bandoneon, the, concertina, and, bandoneon, do, not, have, the, melody, accompaniment, duality, the, harmoneon, is, also, related, and, while, having, the, descant, vs, melody, dualism, tries, to, make, it, less, pronounced, the, harmonium, and, american, reed, organ, are, in, the, same, family, but, are, typically, larger, than, an, accordion, and, sit, on, a, surface, or, the, floor, the, accordion, is, played, by, compressing, or, expanding, the, bellows, while, pressing, buttons, or, keys, causing, pallets, to, open, which, allow, air, to, flow, across, strips, of, brass, or, steel, called, reeds, these, vibrate, to, produce, sound, inside, the, body, valves, on, opposing, reeds, of, each, note, are, used, to, make, the, instrument, s, reeds, sound, louder, without, air, leaking, from, each, reed, block, the, accordion, is, widely, spread, across, the, world, because, of, the, waves, of, migration, from, europe, to, the, americas, and, other, regions, in, some, countries, for, example, argentina, brazil, colombia, the, dominican, republic, mexico, and, panama, it, is, used, in, popular, music, for, example, chamam, in, argentina, gaucho, forr, and, sertanejo, in, brazil, vallenato, in, colombia, merengue, in, the, dominican, republic, and, norte, o, in, mexico, whereas, in, other, regions, such, as, europe, north, america, and, other, countries, in, south, america, it, tends, to, be, more, used, for, dance, pop, and, folk, music, in, europe, and, north, america, some, popular, music, acts, also, make, use, of, the, instrument, additionally, the, accordion, is, used, in, cajun, zydeco, jazz, and, klezmer, music, and, in, both, solo, and, orchestral, performances, of, classical, music, many, conservatories, in, europe, have, classical, accordion, departments, the, oldest, name, for, this, group, of, instruments, is, harmonika, from, the, greek, harmonikos, meaning, harmonic, musical, today, native, versions, of, the, name, accordion, are, more, common, these, names, refer, to, the, type, of, accordion, patented, by, cyrill, demian, which, concerned, automatically, coupled, chords, on, the, bass, side, the, accordion, s, basic, form, is, believed, to, have, been, invented, in, berlin, in, 1822, by, christian, friedrich, ludwig, buschmann, although, one, instrument, was, discovered, in, 2006, that, appears, to, have, been, built, earlier, the, earliest, history, of, the, accordion, in, russia, is, poorly, documented, nevertheless, according, to, russian, researchers, the, earliest, known, simple, accordions, were, made, in, tula, russia, by, ivan, sizov, and, timofey, vorontsov, around, 1830, after, they, received, an, early, accordion, from, germany, by, the, late, 1840s, the, instrument, was, already, very, widespread, together, the, factories, of, the, two, masters, were, producing, 10, 000, instruments, a, year, by, 1866, over, 50, 000, instruments, were, being, produced, yearly, by, tula, and, neighbouring, villages, and, by, 1874, the, yearly, production, was, over, 700, 000, by, the, 1860s, novgorod, vyatka, and, saratov, governorates, also, had, significant, accordion, production, by, the, 1880s, the, list, included, oryol, ryazan, moscow, tver, vologda, kostroma, nizhny, novgorod, and, simbirsk, and, many, of, these, places, created, their, own, varieties, of, the, instrument, the, accordion, is, one, of, several, european, inventions, of, the, early, 19th, century, that, use, free, reeds, driven, by, a, bellows, an, instrument, called, accordion, was, first, patented, in, 1829, by, cyrill, demian, in, vienna, demian, s, instrument, bore, little, resemblance, to, modern, instruments, it, only, had, a, left, hand, buttonboard, with, the, right, hand, simply, operating, the, bellows, one, key, feature, for, which, demian, sought, the, patent, was, the, sounding, of, an, entire, chord, by, depressing, one, key, his, instrument, also, could, sound, two, different, chords, with, the, same, key, one, for, each, bellows, direction, a, bisonoric, action, at, that, time, in, vienna, mouth, harmonicas, with, kanzellen, chambers, had, already, been, available, for, many, years, along, with, bigger, instruments, driven, by, hand, bellows, the, diatonic, key, arrangement, was, also, already, in, use, on, mouth, blown, instruments, demian, s, patent, thus, covered, an, accompanying, instrument, an, accordion, played, with, the, left, hand, opposite, to, the, way, that, contemporary, chromatic, hand, harmonicas, were, played, small, and, light, enough, for, travelers, to, take, with, them, and, used, to, accompany, singing, the, patent, also, described, instruments, with, both, bass, and, treble, sections, although, demian, preferred, the, bass, only, instrument, owing, to, its, cost, and, weight, advantages, the, accordion, was, introduced, from, germany, into, britain, in, about, the, year, 1828, the, instrument, was, noted, in, the, times, in, 1831, as, one, new, to, british, audiences, and, was, not, favourably, reviewed, but, nevertheless, it, soon, became, popular, it, had, also, become, popular, with, new, yorkers, by, the, mid, 1840s, after, demian, s, invention, other, accordions, appeared, some, featuring, only, the, right, handed, keyboard, for, playing, melodies, it, took, english, inventor, charles, wheatstone, to, bring, both, chords, and, keyboard, together, in, one, squeezebox, his, 1844, patent, for, what, he, called, a, concertina, also, featured, the, ability, to, easily, tune, the, reeds, from, the, outside, with, a, simple, tool, the, austrian, musician, adolf, m, ller, described, a, great, variety, of, instruments, in, his, 1854, book, schule, f, r, accordion, at, the, time, vienna, and, london, had, a, close, musical, relationship, with, musicians, often, performing, in, both, cities, in, the, same, year, so, it, is, possible, that, wheatstone, was, aware, of, this, type, of, instrument, and, may, have, used, them, to, put, his, key, arrangement, ideas, into, practice, jeune, s, flutina, resembles, wheatstone, s, concertina, in, internal, construction, and, tone, colour, but, it, appears, to, complement, demian, s, accordion, functionally, the, flutina, is, a, one, sided, bisonoric, melody, only, instrument, whose, keys, are, operated, with, the, right, hand, while, the, bellows, is, operated, with, the, left, when, the, two, instruments, are, combined, the, result, is, quite, similar, to, diatonic, button, accordions, still, manufactured, today, further, innovations, followed, and, continue, to, the, present, various, buttonboard, and, keyboard, systems, have, been, developed, as, well, as, voicings, the, combination, of, multiple, tones, at, different, octaves, with, mechanisms, to, switch, between, different, voices, during, performance, and, different, methods, of, internal, construction, to, improve, tone, stability, and, durability, modern, accordions, may, incorporate, electronics, such, as, condenser, microphones, and, tone, and, volume, controls, so, that, the, accordion, can, be, plugged, into, a, pa, system, or, keyboard, amplifier, for, live, shows, some, 2010s, era, accordions, may, incorporate, midi, sensors, and, circuitry, enabling, the, accordion, to, be, plugged, into, a, synth, module, and, produce, accordion, sounds, or, other, synthesized, instrument, sounds, such, as, piano, or, organ, accordions, have, many, configurations, and, types, what, may, be, easy, to, do, with, one, type, of, accordion, could, be, technically, challenging, or, impossible, with, another, and, proficiency, with, one, layout, may, not, translate, to, another, the, most, obvious, difference, between, accordions, is, their, right, hand, sides, piano, accordions, use, a, piano, style, musical, keyboard, button, accordions, use, a, buttonboard, button, accordions, are, furthermore, differentiated, by, their, usage, of, a, chromatic, or, diatonic, buttonboard, for, the, right, hand, side, accordions, may, be, either, bisonoric, producing, different, pitches, depending, on, the, direction, of, bellows, movement, or, unisonoric, producing, the, same, pitch, in, both, directions, piano, accordions, are, unisonoric, chromatic, button, accordions, also, tend, to, be, unisonoric, while, diatonic, button, accordions, tend, to, be, bisonoric, though, notable, exceptions, exist, accordion, size, is, not, standardized, and, may, vary, significantly, from, model, to, model, accordions, vary, not, only, in, their, dimensions, and, weight, but, also, in, number, of, buttons, or, keys, present, in, the, right, and, left, hand, keyboards, for, example, piano, accordions, may, have, as, few, as, 8, bass, buttons, two, rows, of, four, or, up, to, 140, seven, rows, of, twenty, or, beyond, accordions, also, vary, by, their, available, registers, and, by, their, specific, tuning, and, voicing, despite, these, differences, all, accordions, share, a, number, of, common, components, the, bellows, is, the, most, recognizable, part, of, the, instrument, and, the, primary, means, of, articulation, the, production, of, sound, in, an, accordion, is, in, direct, proportion, to, the, motion, of, the, bellows, by, the, player, in, a, sense, the, role, of, the, bellows, can, be, compared, to, the, role, of, moving, a, violin, s, bow, on, bowed, strings, for, a, more, direct, analogy, the, bellows, can, be, compared, to, the, role, of, breathing, for, a, singer, the, bellows, is, located, between, the, right, and, left, hand, keyboards, and, is, made, from, pleated, layers, of, cloth, and, cardboard, with, added, leather, and, metal, it, is, used, to, create, pressure, and, vacuum, driving, air, across, the, internal, reeds, and, producing, sound, by, their, vibrations, applied, pressure, increases, the, volume, the, keyboard, touch, is, not, expressive, and, does, not, affect, dynamics, all, expression, is, effected, through, the, bellows, bellows, effects, include, the, accordion, s, body, consists, of, two, boxes, commonly, made, of, wood, joined, by, the, bellows, these, boxes, house, reed, chambers, for, the, right, and, left, hand, keyboards, each, side, has, grilles, in, order, to, facilitate, the, transmission, of, air, in, and, out, of, the, instrument, and, to, allow, the, sound, to, project, the, grille, at, the, right, hand, side, is, usually, larger, and, is, often, shaped, for, decorative, purposes, the, right, hand, keyboard, is, normally, used, for, playing, the, melody, and, the, left, hand, one, for, playing, the, accompaniment, however, skilled, players, can, reverse, these, roles, and, play, melodies, with, the, left, hand, the, size, and, weight, of, an, accordion, varies, depending, on, its, type, layout, and, playing, range, which, can, be, as, small, as, to, have, only, one, or, two, rows, of, basses, and, a, single, octave, on, the, right, hand, keyboard, to, the, most, common, 120, bass, accordion, and, through, to, large, and, heavy, 160, bass, free, bass, converter, models, the, accordion, is, an, aerophone, the, keyboard, mechanisms, of, the, instrument, either, enable, the, air, flow, or, disable, it, the, term, accordion, covers, a, wide, range, of, instruments, with, varying, components, all, instruments, have, reed, ranks, of, some, format, apart, from, reedless, digital, accordions, not, all, have, switches, to, change, registers, or, ranks, as, some, have, only, one, treble, register, and, one, bass, register, the, most, typical, accordion, is, the, piano, accordion, which, is, used, for, many, musical, genres, another, type, of, accordion, is, the, button, accordion, which, is, used, in, musical, traditions, including, cajun, conjunto, and, tejano, music, swiss, and, slovenian, austro, german, alpine, music, and, argentinian, tango, music, the, helikon, style, accordion, has, multiple, flared, horns, projecting, out, of, the, left, side, to, strengthen, the, bass, tone, the, word, helikon, refers, to, a, deep, pitched, tuba, different, systems, exist, for, the, right, hand, keyboard, of, an, accordion, which, is, normally, used, for, playing, the, melody, while, it, can, also, play, chords, some, use, a, button, layout, arranged, in, one, way, or, another, while, others, use, a, piano, style, keyboard, each, system, has, different, claimed, benefits, by, those, who, prefer, it, they, are, also, used, to, define, one, accordion, or, another, as, a, different, type, different, systems, are, also, in, use, for, the, left, hand, keyboard, which, is, normally, used, for, playing, the, accompaniment, these, usually, use, distinct, bass, buttons, and, often, have, buttons, with, concavities, or, studs, to, help, the, player, navigate, the, layout, despite, not, being, able, to, see, the, buttons, while, playing, there, are, three, general, categories, inside, the, accordion, are, the, reeds, that, generate, the, instrument, tones, these, are, organized, in, different, sounding, banks, which, can, be, further, combined, into, registers, producing, differing, timbres, all, but, the, smaller, accordions, are, equipped, with, switches, that, control, which, combination, of, reed, banks, operate, organized, from, high, to, low, registers, each, register, stop, produces, a, separate, sound, timbre, many, of, which, also, differ, in, octaves, or, in, how, different, octaves, are, combined, see, the, accordion, reed, ranks, and, switches, article, for, further, explanation, and, audio, samples, all, but, the, smaller, accordions, usually, have, treble, switches, the, larger, and, more, expensive, accordions, often, also, have, bass, switches, to, give, options, for, the, reed, bank, on, the, bass, side, in, describing, or, pricing, an, accordion, the, first, factor, is, size, expressed, in, number, of, keys, on, either, side, for, a, piano, type, this, could, for, one, example, be, 37, 96, meaning, 37, treble, keys, three, octaves, plus, one, note, on, the, treble, side, and, 96, bass, keys, a, second, aspect, of, size, is, the, width, of, the, white, keys, which, means, that, even, accordions, with, the, same, number, of, keys, have, keyboards, of, different, lengths, ranging, from, 14, inches, 36, cm, for, a, child, s, accordion, to, 19, inches, 48, cm, for, an, adult, sized, instrument, after, size, the, price, and, weight, of, an, accordion, is, largely, dependent, on, the, number, of, reed, ranks, on, either, side, either, on, a, cassotto, or, not, and, to, a, lesser, degree, on, the, number, of, combinations, available, through, register, switches, the, next, but, important, factor, is, the, quality, of, the, reeds, the, highest, grade, called, a, mano, meaning, hand, made, the, next, tipo, a, mano, like, hand, made, lower, grades, including, export, and, several, more, price, is, also, affected, by, the, use, of, costly, woods, luxury, decorations, and, features, such, as, a, palm, switch, grille, mute, and, so, on, some, accordion, makers, sell, a, range, of, different, models, from, a, less, expensive, base, model, to, a, more, costly, luxury, model, typically, the, register, switches, are, described, as, reeds, 5, 3, meaning, five, reeds, on, the, treble, side, and, three, on, the, bass, and, registers, 13, m, 7, meaning, 13, register, buttons, on, the, treble, side, plus, a, special, master, that, activates, all, ranks, like, the, tutti, or, full, organ, switch, on, an, organ, and, seven, register, switches, on, the, bass, side, another, factor, affecting, the, price, is, the, presence, of, electronics, such, as, condenser, microphones, volume, and, tone, controls, or, midi, sensors, and, connections, the, larger, piano, and, chromatic, button, accordions, are, usually, heavier, than, other, smaller, squeezeboxes, and, are, equipped, with, two, shoulder, straps, to, make, it, easier, to, balance, the, weight, and, increase, bellows, control, while, sitting, and, avoid, dropping, the, instrument, while, standing, other, accordions, such, as, the, diatonic, button, accordion, have, only, a, single, shoulder, strap, and, a, right, hand, thumb, strap, all, accordions, have, a, mostly, adjustable, leather, strap, on, the, left, hand, side, to, keep, the, player, s, hand, in, position, while, drawing, the, bellows, there, are, also, straps, above, and, below, the, bellows, to, keep, it, securely, closed, when, the, instrument, is, not, being, played, in, the, 2010s, a, range, of, electronic, and, digital, accordions, were, introduced, they, have, an, electronic, sound, module, which, creates, the, accordion, sound, and, most, use, midi, systems, to, encode, the, keypresses, and, transmit, them, to, the, sound, module, a, digital, accordion, can, have, hundreds, of, sounds, which, can, include, different, types, of, accordions, and, even, non, accordion, sounds, such, as, pipe, organ, piano, or, guitar, sensors, are, used, on, the, buttons, and, keys, such, as, magnetic, reed, switches, sensors, are, also, used, on, the, bellows, to, transmit, the, pushing, and, pulling, of, the, bellows, to, the, sound, module, digital, accordions, may, have, features, not, found, in, acoustic, instruments, such, as, a, piano, style, sustain, pedal, a, modulation, control, for, changing, keys, and, a, portamento, effect, as, an, electronic, instrument, these, types, of, accordions, are, plugged, into, a, pa, system, or, keyboard, amplifier, to, produce, sound, some, digital, accordions, have, a, small, internal, speaker, and, amplifier, so, they, can, be, used, without, a, pa, system, or, keyboard, amplifier, at, least, for, practicing, and, small, venues, like, coffeehouses, one, benefit, of, electronic, accordions, is, that, they, can, be, practiced, with, headphones, making, them, inaudible, to, other, people, nearby, on, a, digital, accordion, the, volume, of, the, right, hand, keyboard, and, the, left, hand, buttons, can, be, independently, adjusted, acoustic, digital, hybrid, accordions, also, exist, they, are, acoustic, accordions, with, reeds, bellows, and, so, on, but, they, also, contain, sensors, electronics, and, midi, connections, which, provides, a, wider, range, of, sound, options, an, acoustic, digital, hybrid, may, be, manufactured, in, this, form, or, it, may, be, an, acoustic, accordion, which, has, had, aftermarket, electronics, sensors, and, connections, added, several, companies, sell, aftermarket, electronics, kits, but, they, are, typically, installed, by, professional, accordion, technicians, because, of, the, complex, and, delicate, nature, of, the, internal, parts, of, an, accordion, various, hybrid, accordions, have, been, created, between, instruments, of, different, buttonboards, and, actions, many, remain, curiosities, only, a, few, have, remained, in, use, the, most, expensive, accordions, are, typically, fully, hand, made, particularly, the, reeds, completely, hand, made, reeds, have, a, better, tonal, quality, than, even, the, best, automatically, manufactured, ones, some, accordions, have, been, modified, by, individuals, striving, to, bring, a, more, pure, sound, out, of, low, end, instruments, such, as, the, ones, improved, by, yutaka, usui, a, japanese, craftsman, the, manufacture, of, an, accordion, is, only, a, partly, automated, process, in, a, sense, all, accordions, are, handmade, since, there, is, always, some, hand, assembly, of, the, small, parts, required, the, general, process, involves, making, the, individual, parts, assembling, the, subsections, assembling, the, entire, instrument, and, final, decorating, and, packaging, notable, centres, of, production, are, the, italian, cities, of, stradella, and, castelfidardo, with, many, small, and, medium, size, manufacturers, especially, at, the, latter, castelfidardo, honours, the, memory, of, paolo, soprani, who, was, one, of, the, first, large, scale, producers, maugein, freres, has, built, accordions, in, the, french, town, of, tulle, since, 1919, and, the, company, is, now, the, last, complete, process, manufacturer, of, accordions, in, france, german, companies, such, as, hohner, and, weltmeister, made, large, numbers, of, accordions, but, production, diminished, by, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, hohner, still, manufactures, its, top, end, models, in, germany, and, weltmeister, instruments, are, still, handmade, by, harmona, akkordeon, gmbh, in, klingenthal, the, accordion, has, traditionally, been, used, to, perform, folk, or, ethnic, music, popular, music, and, transcriptions, from, the, operatic, and, light, classical, music, repertoire, it, was, also, used, by, the, kikuyu, tribe, in, kenya, and, is, the, main, instrument, in, the, traditional, mwomboko, dance, today, the, instrument, is, sometimes, heard, in, contemporary, pop, styles, such, as, rock, and, pop, rock, and, occasionally, even, in, serious, classical, music, concerts, as, well, as, advertisements, the, accordion, s, popularity, spread, rapidly, it, has, mostly, been, associated, with, the, common, people, and, was, propagated, by, europeans, who, emigrated, around, the, world, the, accordion, in, both, button, and, piano, forms, became, a, favorite, of, folk, musicians, and, has, been, integrated, into, traditional, music, styles, all, over, the, world, see, the, list, of, music, styles, that, incorporate, the, accordion, early, jazz, accordionists, include, charles, melrose, who, recorded, wailing, blues, barrel, house, stomp, 1930, voc, 1503, with, the, cellar, boys, buster, moten, who, played, second, piano, and, accordion, in, the, bennie, moten, orchestra, and, jack, cornell, who, did, recordings, with, irving, mills, later, jazz, accordionists, from, the, united, states, include, steve, bach, milton, delugg, orlando, digirolamo, angelo, di, pippo, dominic, frontiere, guy, klucevsek, yuri, lemeshev, frank, marocco, dr, william, schimmel, john, serry, sr, lee, tomboulian, and, art, van, damme, french, jazz, accordionists, include, richard, galliano, bernard, lubat, and, vincent, peirani, norwegian, jazz, accordionists, include, asmund, bj, rken, stian, carstensen, gabriel, fliflet, frode, haltli, and, eivin, one, pedersen, the, constraints, of, the, stradella, bass, system, limiting, the, left, hand, to, preset, chord, buttons, is, a, barrier, to, some, jazz, chord, conventions, jazz, accordionists, expand, the, range, of, chord, possibilities, by, using, more, than, one, chord, button, simultaneously, or, by, using, combinations, of, a, chord, button, and, a, bass, note, other, than, the, typical, root, of, the, chord, an, example, of, the, former, technique, is, used, to, play, a, minor, seventh, chord, to, play, an, am, 7, add9, chord, the, am, and, em, preset, buttons, are, pressed, simultaneously, along, with, an, a, bassnote, an, example, of, the, latter, technique, is, used, to, play, the, half, diminished, chord, to, play, an, e, 7, a, gm, preset, button, is, pressed, along, with, an, e, bassnote, for, the, left, hand, the, free, bass, system, is, used, in, jazz, as, a, means, of, creating, complex, chord, voicings, jazz, harmony, that, would, otherwise, be, difficult, to, replicate, with, the, stradella, bass, system, such, as, tritone, substitutions, become, more, accessible, using, a, free, bass, accordion, the, accordion, appeared, in, popular, music, from, the, 1900s, to, the, 1960s, this, half, century, is, often, called, the, golden, age, of, the, accordion, five, players, pietro, frosini, the, two, brothers, count, guido, deiro, and, pietro, deiro, and, slovenian, brothers, vilko, ovsenik, and, slavko, avsenik, charles, magnante, were, major, influences, at, this, time, most, vaudeville, theaters, closed, during, the, great, depression, but, accordionists, during, the, 1930s, 1950s, taught, and, performed, for, radio, included, among, this, group, was, the, concert, virtuoso, john, serry, sr, during, the, 1950s, through, the, 1980s, the, accordion, received, significant, exposure, on, television, with, performances, by, myron, floren, on, the, lawrence, welk, show, in, the, late, 1950s, and, early, 1960s, the, accordion, declined, in, popularity, because, of, the, rise, of, rock,
