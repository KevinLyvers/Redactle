david, is, a, masterpiece, of, italian, renaissance, sculpture, in, marble, created, from, 1501, to, 1504, by, michelangelo, with, a, height, of, 5, 17, metres, 17, ft, 0, in, the, david, was, the, first, colossal, marble, statue, made, in, the, high, renaissance, and, since, classical, antiquity, a, precedent, for, the, 16th, century, and, beyond, david, was, originally, commissioned, as, one, of, a, series, of, statues, of, twelve, prophets, to, be, positioned, along, the, roofline, of, the, east, end, of, florence, cathedral, but, was, instead, placed, in, the, public, square, in, front, of, the, palazzo, della, signoria, the, seat, of, civic, government, in, florence, where, it, was, unveiled, on, 8, september, 1504, in, 1873, the, statue, was, moved, to, the, galleria, dell, accademia, florence, in, 1910, a, replica, was, installed, at, the, original, site, on, the, public, square, the, biblical, figure, david, was, a, favoured, subject, in, the, art, of, florence, because, of, the, nature, of, the, figure, it, represented, the, statue, soon, came, to, symbolize, the, defence, of, civil, liberties, embodied, in, the, 1494, constitution, of, the, republic, of, florence, an, independent, city, state, threatened, on, all, sides, by, more, powerful, rival, states, and, by, the, political, aspirations, of, the, medici, family, the, history, of, the, statue, of, david, begins, before, michelangelo, s, work, on, it, from, 1501, to, 1504, the, commission, was, made, during, a, decisive, period, in, the, history, of, the, florentine, republic, established, after, the, expulsion, of, the, medici, the, advantages, of, democratic, government, never, materialized, and, internal, circumstances, grew, worse, as, dangers, from, without, increased, lorenzo, de, medici, s, successors, and, their, supporters, were, a, constant, threat, to, the, republic, and, it, was, in, defiance, of, the, menace, they, represented, that, the, project, of, a, marble, david, was, renewed, the, overseers, of, the, office, of, works, known, as, the, operai, del, duomo, were, officers, of, the, opera, di, santa, maria, del, fiore, the, organization, charged, with, the, construction, and, maintenance, of, the, new, cathedral, of, florence, the, operai, consisted, of, a, 12, member, committee, that, organized, competitions, chose, the, best, entries, commissioned, the, prevailing, artists, and, paid, for, the, finished, work, most, of, them, were, members, of, the, influential, woolen, cloth, guild, the, arte, della, lana, they, had, plans, long, before, michelangelo, s, involvement, to, commission, a, series, of, twelve, large, sculptures, of, old, testament, prophets, for, the, twelve, spurs, or, protrusions, generated, by, the, four, diagonal, buttresses, that, helped, support, the, enormous, weight, of, the, cathedral, dome, in, 1410, donatello, had, made, the, first, of, the, series, of, statues, a, colossal, figure, of, joshua, in, terracotta, gessoed, and, painted, white, to, give, it, the, appearance, of, marble, at, a, distance, although, charles, seymour, jr, says, donatello, s, prot, g, agostino, di, duccio, was, commissioned, in, 1463, to, create, a, terracotta, figure, of, hercules, for, the, series, almost, certainly, under, the, supervision, of, donatello, paoletti, writes, that, the, term, hercules, may, not, be, a, specific, indication, of, the, subject, of, the, figure, but, simply, a, synonym, used, at, the, time, for, a, giant, or, very, large, figure, ready, to, continue, their, project, in, 1464, the, operai, contracted, agostino, to, create, a, marble, sculpture, of, the, young, david, a, symbol, of, florence, to, be, mounted, high, on, the, eastern, end, of, the, duomo, this, was, to, be, formed, in, the, roman, manner, from, several, blocks, of, marble, but, in, 1465, agostino, himself, went, to, carrara, a, town, in, the, apuan, alps, and, acquired, a, very, large, block, of, bianco, ordinario, from, the, fantiscritti, quarry, he, began, work, on, the, statue, but, got, only, as, far, as, beginning, to, shape, the, torso, legs, and, feet, roughing, out, drapery, and, possibly, hollowing, a, hole, between, the, legs, for, unknown, reasons, his, work, on, the, block, of, marble, halted, with, the, death, of, his, master, donatello, in, 1466, antonio, rossellino, also, a, florentine, was, commissioned, in, 1476, to, resume, the, work, but, the, contract, was, apparently, rescinded, and, the, block, lay, neglected, and, exposed, to, the, weather, in, the, yard, of, the, cathedral, workshop, for, another, twenty, five, years, this, was, of, great, concern, to, the, operai, authorities, as, such, a, large, piece, of, marble, was, not, only, costly, but, represented, considerable, labour, and, difficulty, in, its, transportation, to, florence, in, 1500, an, inventory, of, the, cathedral, workshops, described, the, piece, as, a, certain, figure, of, marble, called, david, badly, blocked, out, and, supine, a, year, later, documents, showed, that, the, operai, were, determined, to, find, an, artist, who, could, take, this, large, piece, of, marble, and, turn, it, into, a, finished, work, of, art, they, ordered, that, the, block, of, stone, which, they, called, il, gigante, the, giant, be, raised, on, its, feet, so, that, a, master, experienced, in, this, kind, of, work, might, examine, it, and, express, an, opinion, though, leonardo, da, vinci, among, others, was, consulted, and, andrea, sansovino, was, also, keen, to, get, the, commission, it, was, michelangelo, at, 26, years, of, age, who, convinced, the, operai, that, he, deserved, the, commission, on, 16, august, 1501, michelangelo, was, given, the, official, contract, to, undertake, this, task, it, said, english, translation, of, the, latin, text, the, consuls, of, the, arte, della, lana, and, the, lords, overseers, being, met, have, chosen, as, sculptor, to, the, said, cathedral, the, worthy, master, michelangelo, the, son, of, lodovico, buonarrotti, a, citizen, of, florence, to, the, end, that, he, may, make, finish, and, bring, to, perfection, the, male, figure, known, as, the, giant, nine, braccia, in, height, already, blocked, out, in, marble, by, maestro, agostino, grande, of, florence, and, badly, blocked, and, now, stored, in, the, workshops, of, the, cathedral, the, work, shall, be, completed, within, the, period, and, term, of, two, years, next, ensuing, beginning, from, the, first, day, of, september, he, began, carving, the, statue, early, in, the, morning, on, 13, september, a, month, after, he, was, awarded, the, contract, the, contract, provided, him, a, workspace, in, the, opera, di, santa, maria, del, fiore, behind, the, duomo, paid, him, a, salary, of, six, fiorini, per, month, and, allowed, him, two, years, to, complete, the, sculpture, when, the, finished, statue, was, moved, from, the, opera, del, duomo, to, the, piazza, della, signoria, over, the, course, of, four, days, as, reported, by, two, contemporary, diarists, luca, landucci, and, pietro, di, marco, parenti, a, guard, was, placed, to, protect, it, from, violence, by, other, artists, in, florence, who, had, hoped, for, the, commission, they, were, hostile, to, michelangelo, because, of, his, bold, request, to, the, wardens, of, the, cathedral, and, the, governor, of, the, city, piero, soderini, despite, the, precaution, the, sculpture, was, damaged, by, stones, leaving, still, visible, marks, on, the, upper, part, of, its, back, four, youths, from, prominent, florentine, families, were, subsequently, arrested, by, the, otto, di, guardia, and, all, but, one, were, imprisoned, for, what, may, have, been, simple, vandalism, without, a, political, motive, michelangelo, regarded, a, single, block, of, stone, as, containing, all, the, possible, conceptions, for, a, work, of, art, and, believed, that, the, artist, s, task, is, sculpting, the, marble, block, to, reveal, the, ideal, form, within, an, expression, of, his, neo, platonic, belief, that, body, and, mind, are, separate, and, must, work, in, concert, and, strive, to, attain, union, with, one, another, and, with, the, divine, in, later, years, speaking, of, his, early, commissions, sculpting, marble, he, contended, that, he, was, merely, liberating, figures, that, were, already, existent, in, the, stone, and, that, he, could, see, them, in, his, mind, s, eye, giorgio, vasari, wrote, of, michelangelo, sculpting, the, prisoners, that, his, method, was, to, chisel, the, parts, in, highest, relief, first, then, gradually, revealing, the, lower, parts, according, to, franca, falletti, the, passage, describes, michelangelo, s, process, of, working, marble, in, general, lengthy, preparatory, work, was, done, before, the, actual, sculpting, began, this, included, sketches, drawings, and, the, making, of, small, scale, terracotta, or, wax, models, after, these, preliminary, studies, he, went, directly, to, sculpting, the, marble, using, the, method, described, by, vasari, he, chiseled, layer, after, layer, from, the, main, face, of, the, stone, and, then, gradually, more, and, more, of, the, other, sides, the, unfinished, state, of, the, prisoners, demonstrates, this, process, and, david, must, have, been, sculpted, in, the, same, manner, the, massive, block, of, white, marble, that, was, to, become, the, david, measuring, nine, braccia, in, length, was, of, bianco, ordinario, grade, stone, rather, than, the, superior, statuario, it, came, from, the, old, roman, fantiscritti, quarry, at, the, centre, of, the, carrara, marble, basins, and, had, been, transported, by, oxen, pulled, carts, to, the, sea, whence, it, was, carried, on, barges, dragged, by, oxen, up, the, river, arno, to, florence, the, operai, del, duomo, had, raised, the, block, to, an, upright, position, prior, to, the, first, inspection, of, their, purchase, but, a, scaffolding, had, to, be, built, so, that, michelangelo, could, reach, every, part, the, artist, who, made, his, steel, chisels, himself, began, cutting, the, stone, with, the, subbia, a, heavy, pointed, iron, tool, used, to, rough, out, the, main, mass, before, he, employed, the, two, toothed, shorter, blade, called, the, calcagnuolo, by, the, time, he, began, to, use, the, three, toothed, gradina, a, serrated, claw, chisel, whose, marks, are, seen, in, his, unfinished, sculptures, the, basic, form, of, the, statue, was, emerging, from, the, matrix, when, he, sculpted, david, s, hair, and, the, pupils, of, his, eyes, he, used, the, trapano, a, drill, worked, with, a, bow, like, the, ancient, sculptors, michelangelo, did, without, flat, chisels, in, his, sculpturing, and, brought, his, pieces, to, the, state, of, non, finito, almost, entirely, with, toothed, chisels, during, the, 2003, restoration, of, david, italian, researchers, observed, marks, of, the, subbia, the, sharpened, subbia, da, taglio, the, slightly, flattened, unghietto, fingernail, and, the, gradina, as, well, as, marks, from, a, smaller, toothed, chisel, the, dente, di, cane, dog, s, tooth, they, found, no, evidence, of, michelangelo, using, flat, chisels, in, the, work, a, node, of, marble, on, the, gigante, that, michelangelo, chiseled, away, before, he, began, work, on, david, in, earnest, has, been, interpreted, by, historians, as, a, knot, of, drapery, based, on, the, surmise, that, agostino, di, duccio, s, figure, was, intended, to, be, clothed, irving, lavin, proposes, that, the, node, may, have, been, a, point, that, is, a, knob, of, marble, left, purposely, by, agostino, as, a, fixed, reference, for, a, mechanical, transfer, measuring, off, his, statue, from, the, model, lavin, suggests, that, agostino, s, aborted, attempt, was, the, result, of, an, error, in, his, pointing, system, and, that, if, his, conjecture, is, correct, it, may, illuminate, a, note, added, in, the, margin, next, to, the, passage, in, the, commission, giving, il, gigante, to, michelangelo, the, said, michelangelo, began, to, work, on, the, said, giant, on, the, morning, of, 13, september, 1501, although, a, few, days, earlier, on, 9, september, he, had, with, one, or, two, blows, of, the, chisel, uno, vel, duo, ictibus, removed, a, certain, nodus, quoddam, nodum, that, it, had, on, its, chest, on, 25, january, 1504, when, the, sculpture, was, nearing, completion, florentine, authorities, had, to, acknowledge, there, would, be, little, possibility, of, raising, the, 5, 17, metre, high, statue, weighing, approximately, 8, 5, tons, to, the, roof, of, the, cathedral, they, convened, a, committee, of, 30, florentine, citizens, that, included, many, artists, including, leonardo, da, vinci, and, sandro, botticelli, to, decide, on, an, appropriate, site, for, david, while, nine, different, locations, for, the, statue, were, discussed, the, majority, of, members, seem, to, have, been, closely, split, between, two, sites, one, group, led, by, giuliano, da, sangallo, and, supported, by, leonardo, and, piero, di, cosimo, among, others, believed, that, due, to, the, imperfections, in, the, marble, the, sculpture, should, be, placed, under, the, roof, of, the, loggia, dei, lanzi, on, piazza, della, signoria, the, other, group, thought, it, should, stand, at, the, entrance, to, the, palazzo, della, signoria, the, city, s, town, hall, now, known, as, palazzo, vecchio, another, opinion, shared, by, botticelli, and, cosimo, rosselli, was, that, the, sculpture, should, be, situated, in, front, of, the, cathedral, in, june, 1504, david, was, installed, next, to, the, entrance, to, the, palazzo, della, signoria, replacing, donatello, s, bronze, sculpture, of, judith, and, holofernes, which, also, embodied, a, theme, of, heroic, resistance, it, took, four, days, to, move, it, the, half, mile, from, the, cathedral, s, workshop, into, the, piazza, della, signoria, the, statue, was, suspended, in, a, wooden, frame, and, rolled, on, fourteen, greased, logs, by, more, than, 40, men, later, that, summer, the, sling, and, tree, stump, support, were, gilded, and, the, figure, was, given, a, gilt, loin, garland, in, 1525, the, block, of, marble, intended, to, be, the, pendant, for, the, david, fell, off, a, barge, into, the, river, arno, as, it, was, being, transported, to, florence, vasari, wrote, that, it, had, jumped, into, the, river, in, despair, when, it, heard, that, baccio, bandinelli, would, be, carving, it, rather, than, michelangelo, to, whom, the, commission, for, a, colossal, statue, of, hercules, and, cacus, at, the, entrance, to, the, palazzo, della, signoria, had, originally, been, given, in, the, mid, 1800s, small, cracks, were, noticed, on, the, left, leg, on, the, david, which, can, possibly, be, attributed, to, an, uneven, sinking, of, the, ground, under, the, massive, statue, in, 1873, it, was, removed, from, the, piazza, to, protect, it, from, damage, and, was, moved, to, the, accademia, gallery, where, it, would, attract, many, visitors, the, sculpture, was, secured, in, a, wheeled, wooden, crate, and, moved, slowly, across, the, city, from, 30, july, to, 10, august, that, year, its, 16th, century, base, said, to, be, decrepit, in, contemporary, reports, was, lost, when, the, crate, was, disassembled, a, model, of, the, crate, is, in, the, museo, di, casa, buonarroti, the, house, museum, in, florence, s, via, ghibellina, where, michelangelo, lived, the, statue, was, not, placed, in, its, permanent, setting, in, the, accademia, until, 1882, the, architect, emilio, de, fabris, professor, at, the, accademia, designed, a, tribune, to, house, the, david, in, a, vaulted, interior, exedra, towards, the, apse, where, it, was, bathed, in, light, that, streamed, in, through, windows, in, the, dome, above, a, replica, was, placed, in, the, piazza, della, signoria, in, 1910, in, 1991, piero, cannata, an, artist, whom, the, police, described, as, deranged, attacked, the, statue, with, a, hammer, he, had, concealed, beneath, his, jacket, and, damaged, the, second, toe, of, the, left, foot, he, later, said, that, a, 16th, century, venetian, painter, s, model, ordered, him, to, do, so, cannata, was, restrained, by, museum, patrons, until, the, police, arrived, fragments, fell, to, the, floor, and, three, tourists, were, caught, by, guards, as, they, were, trying, to, leave, the, gallery, with, pieces, in, their, pockets, the, state, of, preservation, of, the, david, has, been, monitored, and, evaluated, since, 2000, using, high, resolution, 3d, scanning, photogrammetry, finite, element, method, fem, analyses, and, in, situ, fracture, monitoring, through, fibre, optic, bragg, gratings, these, observations, have, shown, that, in, its, present, vertical, orientation, with, the, basal, plinth, horizontal, the, centre, of, gravity, of, the, base, does, not, align, with, the, david, s, centre, of, gravity, nevertheless, fem, analysis, suggests, that, the, statue, is, stable, in, its, current, position, and, indicates, that, its, forward, inclination, of, 1, degree, to, 3, degrees, has, played, a, major, part, in, the, development, of, cracks, in, the, ankles, in, 2006, borri, and, grazini, using, historical, analysis, and, a, finite, element, model, of, the, david, identified, the, probable, cause, of, the, cracks, in, its, legs, as, a, slight, forward, inclination, of, the, statue, that, developed, after, the, flood, of, 1844, in, florence, the, statue, being, located, outdoors, in, front, of, the, palazzo, della, signoria, palazzo, vecchio, from, 1504, to, 1873, this, inclination, likely, occurred, because, of, the, uneven, subsidence, and, rotation, of, the, statue, s, foundations, further, damage, occurred, with, the, additional, weight, placed, on, the, statue, when, in, 1847, clemente, papi, made, a, plaster, mould, composed, of, more, than, 1, 500, separate, segments, some, weighing, as, much, as, 680, kg, the, sculpture, was, also, inclined, on, other, occasions, such, as, when, it, was, moved, in, 1873, to, its, placement, in, the, galleria, dell, accademia, after, which, the, tilt, was, corrected, ultrasonic, crack, assessment, tests, carried, out, by, pascale, and, lolli, in, 2014, determined, that, cracks, in, the, broncone, the, tree, trunk, against, which, the, david, s, right, leg, rests, are, the, most, worrisome, of, those, in, the, statue, the, left, ankle, and, the, area, where, the, left, heel, and, the, base, are, attached, also, show, cracks, of, critical, concern, some, scholars, have, suggested, that, the, relative, weakness, caused, by, the, cracks, in, its, legs, could, make, the, statue, vulnerable, to, the, vibrations, of, foot, traffic, from, visitors, to, the, gallery, nearly, a, million, and, a, half, tourists, about, four, thousand, people, each, day, it, is, open, visit, the, accademia, gallery, annually, to, see, the, david, in, 2015, pieraccini, et, al, measured, its, dynamic, movements, with, interferometric, radar, measurements, were, made, of, such, displacements, on, two, days, monday, 27, july, and, tuesday, 28, july, 2015, on, monday, the, accademia, is, closed, while, tuesday, is, statistically, the, peak, attendance, day, their, results, did, not, show, a, significant, increase, in, the, vibration, amplitude, on, days, the, accademia, was, open, compared, to, days, it, was, closed, in, 2010, a, dispute, over, the, ownership, of, david, arose, when, based, on, a, legal, review, of, historical, documents, the, municipality, of, florence, claimed, ownership, of, the, statue, in, opposition, to, the, italian, culture, ministry, which, disputes, the, municipal, claim, the, pose, of, michelangelo, s, david, is, unlike, that, of, earlier, renaissance, depictions, of, david, the, bronze, statues, by, donatello, and, verrocchio, represented, the, hero, standing, victorious, over, the, head, of, goliath, and, the, painter, andrea, del, castagno, had, shown, the, boy, in, mid, swing, even, as, goliath, s, head, rested, between, his, legs, but, no, earlier, florentine, artist, had, omitted, the, giant, altogether, according, to, such, scholars, as, howard, hibbard, david, is, depicted, before, his, battle, with, goliath, rather, than, being, shown, victorious, over, a, foe, much, larger, than, he, david, looks, wary, as, he, sizes, up, the, giant, goliath, before, the, battle, has, actually, taken, place, his, brow, is, drawn, his, neck, tense, and, the, veins, bulge, out, of, his, lowered, right, hand, his, left, hand, holds, a, sling, that, is, draped, over, his, shoulder, and, down, to, his, right, hand, which, holds, the, handle, of, the, sling, the, twist, of, his, body, in, contrapposto, standing, with, most, of, its, weight, on, his, right, foot, and, the, other, leg, forward, effectively, conveys, to, the, viewer, a, sense, of, potential, energy, the, feeling, that, he, is, about, to, move, the, statue, is, a, renaissance, interpretation, of, a, common, ancient, greek, theme, of, the, standing, heroic, male, nude, in, the, renaissance, contrapposto, poses, were, thought, of, as, a, distinctive, feature, of, antique, sculpture, initially, manifested, in, the, doryphoros, of, polykleitos, c, 440, bc, this, is, typified, in, david, this, classic, pose, causes, both, hips, and, shoulders, to, rest, at, opposing, angles, giving, a, slight, s, curve, to, the, entire, torso, the, contrapposto, stance, is, emphasized, by, the, left, leg, stepping, forward, and, by, the, contrasting, positions, of, the, arms, the, left, arm, raised, with, its, hand, to, the, shoulder, and, the, other, hand, touching, the, thigh, michelangelo, s, david, has, become, one, of, the, most, recognized, works, of, renaissance, sculpture, a, symbol, of, strength, and, youthful, beauty, the, colossal, size, of, the, statue, alone, impressed, michelangelo, s, contemporaries, vasari, described, it, as, certainly, a, miracle, that, michelangelo, was, able, to, raise, up, one, who, had, died, and, then, listed, all, of, the, largest, and, most, grand, of, the, ancient, statues, that, he, had, ever, seen, concluding, that, michelangelo, s, work, surpassed, all, ancient, and, modern, statues, whether, greek, or, latin, that, have, ever, existed, the, proportions, of, the, david, are, atypical, of, michelangelo, s, work, as, well, as, of, antique, models, the, figure, has, an, unusually, large, head, and, hands, particularly, apparent, in, the, right, hand, these, enlargements, may, be, due, to, the, fact, that, the, statue, was, originally, intended, to, be, placed, on, the, cathedral, roofline, where, the, important, parts, of, the, sculpture, may, have, been, accentuated, in, order, to, be, visible, from, below, the, small, size, of, the, genitals, though, is, in, line, with, his, other, works, and, with, renaissance, conventions, in, general, the, statue, is, unusually, slender, front, to, back, in, comparison, to, its, height, which, may, be, a, result, of, the, work, done, on, the, block, before, michelangelo, began, carving, it, a, naturalistic, rendition, of, the, nude, human, body, if, rendered, successfully, has, an, erotic, aspect, vasari, alludes, to, the, statue, s, sexual, locus, when, he, acclaims, the, figure, s, very, divine, flanks, the, flanks, fianchi, frame, this, part, of, the, body, the, nexus, of, its, carnality, antonio, forcellino, calls, the, david, s, sexual, organs, the, most, disquieting, genitals, of, renaissance, sculpture, referring, to, the, manner, in, which, the, small, bulge, typical, of, adolescence, frames, a, tuft, of, pubic, hair, that, supports, a, penis, full, of, energy, and, displays, the, testicles, also, full, of, vigour, commentators, have, noted, the, presence, of, a, foreskin, on, david, s, penis, which, may, appear, at, odds, with, the, judaic, practice, of, circumcision, an, artistic, deviation, from, what, very, likely, would, have, been, accurately, portrayed, as, a, circumcised, penis, it, is, in, keeping, with, the, conventions, of, renaissance, art, in, which, the, christ, child, for, example, is, represented, as, being, uncircumcised, although, clearly, older, than, the, eight, days, compelled, by, jewish, scripture, david, the, giant, killer, had, long, been, seen, as, a, political, symbol, in, florence, and, images, of, the, biblical, hero, already, carried, political, implications, there, donatello, s, bronze, david, made, for, cosimo, de, medici, perhaps, c, 1440, had, been, appropriated, by, the, signoria, in, 1494, when, the, medici, were, exiled, from, florence, and, the, statue, was, installed, in, the, courtyard, of, the, palazzo, della, signoria, where, it, symbolized, the, republican, government, of, the, city, according, to, levine, by, placing, michelangelo, s, statue, in, the, same, general, location, it, is, likely, that, the, david, was, conceived, as, politically, controversial, before, michelangelo, began, work, on, it, as, well, as, an, artistic, response, to, that, earlier, work, while, the, originally, intended, location, for, the, david, was, high, up, on, the, cathedral, its, location, was, still, in, question, the, commission, consisting, of, the, most, prominent, artists, of, the, day, debated, in, great, detail, the, best, placement, for, the, colossal, figure, to, be, seen, and, appreciated, with, consideration, for, its, aria, moda, and, qualit, its, aura, style, and, excellence, the, political, overtones, led, to, the, statue, being, attacked, twice, in, its, early, days, protesters, pelted, it, with, stones, the, year, it, debuted, and, in, 1527, an, anti, medici, riot, resulted, in, its, left, arm, being, broken, into, three, pieces, giorgio, vasari, later, claimed, that, he, and, his, friend, francesco, silviati, although, just, boys, braved, the, violence, and, saved, the, pieces, storing, them, in, silviati, s, father, s, house, machiavelli, wrote, of, the, long, florentine, tradition, that, represented, david, as, defender, of, the, patria, a, convention, most, completely, developed, in, the, arts, especially, in, the, series, of, statues, from, donatello, s, to, michelangelo, s, depicting, him, as, the, protector, of, his, people, having, returned, the, armour, given, him, by, king, saul, and, choosing, to, fight, goliath, with, his, own, weapons, a, sling, and, a, knife, david, personified, the, citizen, soldier, of, florence, and, the, city, s, ability, to, defend, itself, with, its, own, arms, rather, than, placing, goliath, s, severed, head, between, or, underneath, the, david, s, feet, michelangelo, carved, the, stump, of, a, tree, on, the, back, of, the, right, leg, a, device, conventionally, employed, by, sculptors, in, ancient, times, to, help, support, the, weight, of, a, statue, in, a, contemporary, document, the, stump, was, called, broncone, the, same, italian, word, used, for, lorenzo, de, medici, s, personal, emblem, or, impresa, a, dead, branch, of, laurel, sprouting, new, green, growth, soon, after, david, s, installation, in, front, of, the, palazzo, della, signoria, certain, adornments, were, added, that, have, since, disappeared, the, stump, and, the, strap, of, the, sling, were, gilded, a, vine, of, copper, leaves, was, strung, around, the, groin, covering, the, genitals, and, a, laurel, wreath, of, gilt,

tasks, if, they, failed, to, satisfy, these, demands, for, example, women, offenders, would, be, forced, to, gaze, at, the, david, closely, with, eyeglasses, a, notable, product, of, the, city, according, to, paoletti, a, naked, colossus, situated, in, the, primary, public, space, of, the, city, was, necessarily, politically, charged, the, david, s, nakedness, being, more, than, merely, a, reference, to, the, sculpture, of, antiquity, that, inspired, the, arts, in, the, italian, renaissance, standing, at, the, entrance, to, florence, s, town, hall, it, had, power, as, a, political, symbol, using, an, image, of, the, sexualized, human, body, to, represent, the, corporality, of, the, florentine, body, politic, as, a, civic, metaphor, it, resonated, with, the, everyday, life, experiences, of, 16th, century, florentine, people, among, all, the, social, classes, kathleen, weil, garris, brandt, makes, the, case, that, pedestals, are, of, great, significance, for, renaissance, sculpture, and, following, rosalind, krauss, that, it, is, the, support, not, the, statue, itself, that, decides, the, monumentality, of, a, work, of, sculpture, she, describes, how, the, pedestal, that, supports, the, david, has, been, neglected, in, the, literature, as, a, component, of, michelangelo, s, extraordinary, achievement, with, his, completion, of, the, statue, and, is, usually, not, seen, in, photographs, the, bases, of, most, renaissance, statues, have, historically, suffered, a, similar, fate, when, michelangelo, was, young, pedestals, were, seldom, a, matter, of, much, consideration, to, the, sculptor, free, standing, sculpture, executed, by, contemporaries, was, rare, and, was, made, to, surmount, antique, or, new, columns, imbasamento, is, the, italian, word, generally, used, for, the, supports, of, sculpture, these, and, other, kinds, of, pedestals, were, customarily, made, by, scarpellini, that, is, professional, carvers, of, architectural, ornament, or, ideally, by, other, sculptors, on, 11, june, 1504, the, architects, in, charge, of, the, transportation, of, the, statue, to, the, palazzo, della, signoria, simone, del, pollaiolo, and, antonio, da, sangallo, the, elder, were, ordered, by, the, operai, of, the, cathedral, to, make, a, marble, base, subtus, et, circum, circa, pedes, gigantis, underneath, and, around, the, feet, of, the, giant, because, the, david, was, already, situated, the, pedestal, apparently, consisted, of, a, sheath, surrounding, a, core, rather, than, a, solid, block, of, stone, meant, to, support, the, weight, of, the, statue, as, it, was, architects, who, built, and, installed, the, pedestal, they, have, been, credited, entirely, for, its, execution, but, brandt, thinks, it, more, likely, to, have, been, michelangelo, s, idea, according, to, brandt, the, david, marked, a, pivotal, event, in, the, history, of, pedestals, the, first, still, existent, use, in, the, renaissance, of, an, antique, architectural, socle, form, to, support, a, sculptural, colossus, practical, considerations, such, as, the, support, s, ability, to, bear, the, weight, and, the, difficulty, of, installation, were, necessarily, taken, into, account, but, otherwise, its, dimensions, and, form, were, a, matter, of, free, discretion, nevertheless, the, pedestal, was, not, an, arbitrary, decorative, element, that, could, be, exchanged, for, another, in, one, sense, it, was, an, extension, of, the, architectural, surroundings, but, its, form, responded, to, the, figure, it, supports, thereafter, pedestals, would, become, integral, parts, of, sculptures, alison, wright, drawing, on, the, work, of, social, historian, richard, trexler, calls, the, innovative, installation, of, statues, in, the, piazza, della, signoria, in, 16th, century, florence, the, greatest, public, forum, for, the, display, of, modern, freestanding, sculpture, in, renaissance, italy, a, reflection, of, the, importance, given, in, the, city, to, upholding, collective, and, personal, honour, the, pedestal, created, for, michelangelo, s, colossus, was, novel, in, this, social, context, installed, as, the, terminus, of, the, balustrade, that, stood, before, the, town, hall, the, palazzo, della, signoria, considered, within, this, framing, of, the, performative, and, ritual, functions, of, the, city, s, important, sites, pedestals, expressed, the, will, to, do, honour, in, public, and, sacred, spaces, officials, responsible, for, the, artistic, heritage, of, florence, had, become, concerned, about, the, david, s, physical, state, by, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, a, cleaning, of, the, statue, had, apparently, occurred, about, 1746, and, in, 1813, the, sculptor, stefano, ricci, gave, the, statue, a, gentle, cleaning, and, applied, a, thin, coat, of, encaustic, consisting, of, beeswax, possibly, mixed, with, linseed, oil, to, its, surface, as, a, protective, coating, the, sculptor, lorenzo, bartolini, recommended, in, 1842, that, a, thorough, conservation, of, the, statue, should, be, performed, and, like, most, of, the, advisory, committee, formed, in, 1504, that, the, david, be, moved, to, the, loggia, della, signoria, for, its, protection, in, 1843, the, sculptor, aristodemo, costoli, cleaned, the, statue, with, a, 50, per, cent, hydrochloric, acid, solution, that, removed, the, encaustic, coating, and, left, the, marble, surface, pitted, and, porous, damaging, the, statue, far, more, than, the, weathering, it, had, suffered, in, the, previous, 400, years, during, world, war, ii, david, along, with, michelangelo, s, other, sculptures, in, the, accademia, was, packed, in, sand, and, entombed, in, brick, to, protect, it, from, being, damaged, in, 1991, the, left, foot, of, the, statue, was, damaged, by, an, unemployed, italian, man, named, piero, cannata, who, was, carrying, a, hammer, he, had, hidden, under, his, jacket, and, broke, off, the, tip, of, the, second, toe, the, samples, obtained, from, that, incident, allowed, scientists, utilising, spectroscopic, isotopic, and, petrographic, analysis, simultaneously, to, determine, that, the, marble, used, was, obtained, from, the, fantiscritti, quarries, in, miseglia, the, central, of, three, small, valleys, in, carrara, the, chemists, and, spectroscopists, who, conducted, these, tests, say, the, marble, of, the, david, consists, entirely, of, the, mineral, calcite, because, of, the, marble, s, surface, degradation, on, the, eve, of, the, 500th, anniversary, of, the, sculpture, s, unveiling, in, 2004, the, statue, was, given, its, first, major, cleaning, since, 1843, a, scientific, committee, was, formed, to, advise, in, the, restoration, the, committee, was, composed, of, university, professors, and, scientists, from, the, consiglio, nazionale, delle, ricerche, national, research, council, and, the, opificio, delle, pietre, dure, a, government, art, restoration, department, they, carried, out, tests, and, analyses, and, determined, that, the, statue, should, be, cleaned, by, poultices, soaked, in, distilled, water, and, applied, to, the, sculpture, s, surface, agnese, parronchi, the, restorer, originally, selected, by, florentine, museums, superintendent, antonio, paolucci, assessed, the, david, s, condition, herself, by, examining, hundreds, of, photographs, and, performing, a, series, of, tests, consequently, she, opposed, the, committee, s, pre, specified, method, fearing, further, deterioration, and, insisted, that, it, should, be, cleaned, dry, with, soft, brushes, and, motorized, erasers, paolucci, demanded, that, she, use, the, wet, pack, method, instead, but, parronchi, refused, after, parronchi, resigned, restorer, cinzia, parnigoni, undertook, the, job, of, restoring, the, statue, under, the, direction, of, franca, falletti, director, of, the, accademia, gallery, researchers, at, the, university, of, siena, universit, di, siena, performed, an, investigation, of, the, small, cavities, about, a, millimetre, in, diameter, and, of, irregular, distribution, with, which, the, marble, surface, of, the, david, is, covered, their, macroscopic, examination, determined, that, the, cavities, have, not, resulted, from, deterioration, of, the, stone, but, rather, that, they, can, be, attributed, to, the, mineralogical, structure, of, the, marble, taken, from, quarries, in, the, apuan, alps, the, local, quarrymen, in, their, dialect, call, those, less, than, a, millimetre, in, size, tar, li, and, those, several, millimetres, or, larger, they, call, tarme, observation, with, optical, fibres, and, magnifying, lenses, shows, that, the, marble, immediately, surrounding, the, cavity, may, present, milky, white, or, greyish, halos, averaging, a, few, millimetres, wide, many, of, them, are, completely, or, partly, filled, with, various, substances, this, deposition, is, caused, by, the, statue, s, exposure, over, centuries, to, atmospheric, agents, or, to, past, restoration, processes, as, of, 2024, temporary, scaffolding, is, erected, around, the, statue, every, two, months, and, in, an, operation, that, takes, a, half, a, day, dust, and, spider, s, webs, are, removed, using, soft, bristled, brushes, of, various, sizes, and, a, bristle, tipped, vacuum, cleaner, michelangelo, s, david, has, stood, on, display, at, florence, s, galleria, dell, accademia, since, 1873, on, 29, august, 1846, grand, duke, leopold, ii, of, tuscany, commissioned, clemente, papi, a, student, of, stefano, ricci, to, make, a, plaster, cast, of, the, david, papi, a, master, bronze, caster, was, experienced, in, making, moulds, and, reproductions, and, set, about, the, project, in, the, summer, of, 1847, he, probably, used, wax, to, release, the, mould, rather, than, oil, or, fat, this, was, less, damaging, than, the, encaustic, wax, used, by, ricci, in, 1813, but, residue, from, the, gypsum, of, the, plaster, mould, appears, to, be, present, in, places, where, removing, coatings, is, difficult, such, as, between, the, david, s, toes, this, cast, was, to, be, moved, to, various, locations, in, the, city, to, determine, their, suitability, for, the, statue, papi, first, made, two, plaster, replicas, of, the, marble, david, from, his, moulds, one, of, which, was, given, in, 1857, by, leopold, ii, to, queen, victoria, of, england, a, decree, by, the, tuscan, state, on, 2, october, 1858, ordered, the, casting, of, the, entire, figure, of, the, david, which, papi, completed, in, august, 1866, sending, the, finished, statue, to, the, 1867, paris, exposition, the, next, year, his, intention, had, always, been, to, cast, a, bronze, replica, and, this, cast, was, eventually, raised, on, the, piazzale, michelangelo, in, 1875, to, commemorate, the, fourth, centenary, of, michelangelo, s, birth, the, statue, sent, to, queen, victoria, was, intended, as, a, diplomatic, gesture, by, duke, leopoldo, ii, to, assuage, any, ill, feelings, caused, by, his, refusal, to, allow, the, sending, of, a, notable, domenico, ghirlandaio, painting, from, florence, to, london, apparently, queen, victoria, was, surprised, to, receive, such, a, gift, and, gave, the, statue, to, the, newly, opened, south, kensington, museum, now, the, victoria, and, albert, museum, papi, s, copy, which, was, sent, to, the, accademia, di, delle, belle, arti, of, florence, where, it, resides, in, the, gipsoteca, gallery, of, plaster, casts, of, the, istituto, statale, d, arte, has, been, used, to, make, all, subsequent, casts, of, the, david, the, plaster, cast, of, david, at, the, victoria, and, albert, museum, has, a, detachable, plaster, fig, leaf, which, is, displayed, nearby, the, fig, leaf, was, created, in, response, to, queen, victoria, s, apparent, shock, upon, first, viewing, the, statue, s, nudity, and, was, hung, on, the, figure, by, means, of, two, strategically, placed, hooks, prior, to, royal, visits, on, 12, november, 2010, a, fibreglass, replica, of, david, was, installed, atop, a, buttress, on, a, corner, of, the, north, tribune, below, the, roofline, of, florence, cathedral, for, a, week, photographs, of, the, installation, reveal, the, statue, the, way, the, operai, who, commissioned, the, work, originally, expected, it, to, be, seen, michelangelo, s, statue, is, the, best, known, and, the, most, often, reproduced, of, all, the, artistic, works, created, in, florence, later, reproductions, have, been, made, in, plaster, and, in, simulated, marble, fibreglass, signifying, an, attempt, to, lend, an, atmosphere, of, culture, even, in, some, unlikely, settings, such, as, beach, resorts, gambling, casinos, and, model, railroads, some, parody, reproductions, feature, uncharacteristic,
