architecture, is, the, art, and, technique, of, designing, and, building, as, distinguished, from, the, skills, associated, with, construction, it, is, both, the, process, and, the, product, of, sketching, conceiving, planning, designing, and, constructing, buildings, or, other, structures, the, term, comes, from, latin, architectura, from, ancient, greek, arkhit, kt, n, architect, from, arkhi, chief, and, t, kt, n, creator, architectural, works, in, the, material, form, of, buildings, are, often, perceived, as, cultural, symbols, and, as, works, of, art, historical, civilisations, are, often, identified, with, their, surviving, architectural, achievements, the, practice, which, began, in, the, prehistoric, era, has, been, used, as, a, way, of, expressing, culture, by, civilizations, on, all, seven, continents, for, this, reason, architecture, is, considered, to, be, a, form, of, art, texts, on, architecture, have, been, written, since, ancient, times, the, earliest, surviving, text, on, architectural, theories, is, the, 1st, century, ad, treatise, de, architectura, by, the, roman, architect, vitruvius, according, to, whom, a, good, building, embodies, firmitas, utilitas, and, venustas, durability, utility, and, beauty, centuries, later, leon, battista, alberti, developed, his, ideas, further, seeing, beauty, as, an, objective, quality, of, buildings, to, be, found, in, their, proportions, in, the, 19th, century, louis, sullivan, declared, that, form, follows, function, function, began, to, replace, the, classical, utility, and, was, understood, to, include, not, only, practical, but, also, aesthetic, psychological, and, cultural, dimensions, the, idea, of, sustainable, architecture, was, introduced, in, the, late, 20th, century, architecture, began, as, rural, oral, vernacular, architecture, that, developed, from, trial, and, error, to, successful, replication, ancient, urban, architecture, was, preoccupied, with, building, religious, structures, and, buildings, symbolizing, the, political, power, of, rulers, until, greek, and, roman, architecture, shifted, focus, to, civic, virtues, indian, and, chinese, architecture, influenced, forms, all, over, asia, and, buddhist, architecture, in, particular, took, diverse, local, flavors, during, the, middle, ages, pan, european, styles, of, romanesque, and, gothic, cathedrals, and, abbeys, emerged, while, the, renaissance, favored, classical, forms, implemented, by, architects, known, by, name, later, the, roles, of, architects, and, engineers, became, separated, modern, architecture, began, after, world, war, i, as, an, avant, garde, movement, that, sought, to, develop, a, completely, new, style, appropriate, for, a, new, post, war, social, and, economic, order, focused, on, meeting, the, needs, of, the, middle, and, working, classes, emphasis, was, put, on, modern, techniques, materials, and, simplified, geometric, forms, paving, the, way, for, high, rise, superstructures, many, architects, became, disillusioned, with, modernism, which, they, perceived, as, ahistorical, and, anti, aesthetic, and, postmodern, and, contemporary, architecture, developed, over, the, years, the, field, of, architectural, construction, has, branched, out, to, include, everything, from, ship, design, to, interior, decorating, architecture, can, mean, the, philosophy, of, architecture, is, a, branch, of, philosophy, of, art, dealing, with, aesthetic, value, of, architecture, its, semantics, and, in, relation, with, development, of, culture, many, philosophers, and, theoreticians, from, plato, to, michel, foucault, gilles, deleuze, robert, venturi, and, ludwig, wittgenstein, have, concerned, themselves, with, the, nature, of, architecture, and, whether, or, not, architecture, is, distinguished, from, building, the, earliest, surviving, written, work, on, the, subject, of, architecture, is, de, architectura, by, the, roman, architect, vitruvius, in, the, early, 1st, century, ad, according, to, vitruvius, a, good, building, should, satisfy, the, three, principles, of, firmitas, utilitas, venustas, commonly, known, by, the, original, translation, firmness, commodity, and, delight, an, equivalent, in, modern, english, would, be, according, to, vitruvius, the, architect, should, strive, to, fulfill, each, of, these, three, attributes, as, well, as, possible, leon, battista, alberti, who, elaborates, on, the, ideas, of, vitruvius, in, his, treatise, de, re, aedificatoria, saw, beauty, primarily, as, a, matter, of, proportion, although, ornament, also, played, a, part, for, alberti, the, rules, of, proportion, were, those, that, governed, the, idealized, human, figure, the, golden, mean, the, most, important, aspect, of, beauty, was, therefore, an, inherent, part, of, an, object, rather, than, something, applied, superficially, and, was, based, on, universal, recognizable, truths, the, notion, of, style, in, the, arts, was, not, developed, until, the, 16th, century, with, the, writing, of, giorgio, vasari, by, the, 18th, century, his, lives, of, the, most, excellent, painters, sculptors, and, architects, had, been, translated, into, italian, french, spanish, and, english, in, the, 16th, century, italian, mannerist, architect, painter, and, theorist, sebastiano, serlio, wrote, tutte, l, opere, d, architettura, et, prospetiva, complete, works, on, architecture, and, perspective, this, treatise, exerted, immense, influence, throughout, europe, being, the, first, handbook, that, emphasized, the, practical, rather, than, the, theoretical, aspects, of, architecture, and, it, was, the, first, to, catalog, the, five, orders, in, the, early, 19th, century, augustus, welby, northmore, pugin, wrote, contrasts, 1836, that, as, the, title, suggested, contrasted, the, modern, industrial, world, which, he, disparaged, with, an, idealized, image, of, neo, medieval, world, gothic, architecture, pugin, believed, was, the, only, true, christian, form, of, architecture, the, 19th, century, english, art, critic, john, ruskin, in, his, seven, lamps, of, architecture, published, 1849, was, much, narrower, in, his, view, of, what, constituted, architecture, architecture, was, the, art, which, so, disposes, and, adorns, the, edifices, raised, by, men, that, the, sight, of, them, contributes, to, his, mental, health, power, and, pleasure, for, ruskin, the, aesthetic, was, of, overriding, significance, his, work, goes, on, to, state, that, a, building, is, not, truly, a, work, of, architecture, unless, it, is, in, some, way, adorned, for, ruskin, a, well, constructed, well, proportioned, functional, building, needed, string, courses, or, rustication, at, the, very, least, on, the, difference, between, the, ideals, of, architecture, and, mere, construction, the, renowned, 20th, century, architect, le, corbusier, wrote, you, employ, stone, wood, and, concrete, and, with, these, materials, you, build, houses, and, palaces, that, is, construction, ingenuity, is, at, work, but, suddenly, you, touch, my, heart, you, do, me, good, i, am, happy, and, i, say, this, is, beautiful, that, is, architecture, le, corbusier, s, contemporary, ludwig, mies, van, der, rohe, is, said, to, have, stated, in, a, 1959, interview, that, architecture, starts, when, you, carefully, put, two, bricks, together, there, it, begins, the, notable, 19th, century, architect, of, skyscrapers, louis, sullivan, promoted, an, overriding, precept, to, architectural, design, form, follows, function, while, the, notion, that, structural, and, aesthetic, considerations, should, be, entirely, subject, to, functionality, was, met, with, both, popularity, and, skepticism, it, had, the, effect, of, introducing, the, concept, of, function, in, place, of, vitruvius, utility, function, came, to, be, seen, as, encompassing, all, criteria, of, the, use, perception, and, enjoyment, of, a, building, not, only, practical, but, also, aesthetic, psychological, and, cultural, nunzia, rondanini, stated, through, its, aesthetic, dimension, architecture, goes, beyond, the, functional, aspects, that, it, has, in, common, with, other, human, sciences, through, its, own, particular, way, of, expressing, values, architecture, can, stimulate, and, influence, social, life, without, presuming, that, in, and, of, itself, it, will, promote, social, development, to, restrict, the, meaning, of, architectural, formalism, to, art, for, art, s, sake, is, not, only, reactionary, it, can, also, be, a, purposeless, quest, for, perfection, or, originality, which, degrades, form, into, a, mere, instrumentality, among, the, philosophies, that, have, influenced, modern, architects, and, their, approach, to, building, design, are, rationalism, empiricism, structuralism, poststructuralism, deconstruction, and, phenomenology, in, the, late, 20th, century, a, new, concept, was, added, to, those, included, in, the, compass, of, both, structure, and, function, the, consideration, of, sustainability, hence, sustainable, architecture, to, satisfy, the, contemporary, ethos, a, building, should, be, constructed, in, a, manner, which, is, environmentally, friendly, in, terms, of, the, production, of, its, materials, its, impact, upon, the, natural, and, built, environment, of, its, surrounding, area, and, the, demands, that, it, makes, upon, the, natural, environment, for, heating, ventilation, and, cooling, water, use, waste, products, and, lighting, building, first, evolved, out, of, the, dynamics, between, needs, e, g, shelter, security, and, worship, and, means, available, building, materials, and, attendant, skills, as, human, cultures, developed, and, knowledge, began, to, be, formalized, through, oral, traditions, and, practices, building, became, a, craft, and, architecture, became, the, term, used, to, describe, the, highly, formalized, and, respected, aspects, of, the, craft, it, is, widely, assumed, that, architectural, success, was, achieved, through, trial, and, error, with, progressively, less, trial, and, more, replication, as, results, became, satisfactory, over, time, vernacular, architecture, continues, to, be, produced, in, many, parts, of, the, world, early, human, settlements, were, mostly, rural, expanding, economies, resulted, in, the, creation, of, proto, cities, or, urban, areas, which, in, some, cases, grew, and, evolved, very, rapidly, such, as, atalh, y, k, in, modern, day, turkey, and, mohenjo, daro, in, modern, day, pakistan, neolithic, archaeological, sites, include, g, bekli, tepe, and, atalh, y, k, in, turkey, jericho, in, the, levant, mehrgarh, in, pakistan, skara, brae, in, orkney, and, cucuteni, trypillian, culture, settlements, in, romania, moldova, and, ukraine, in, many, ancient, civilizations, such, as, those, of, egypt, and, mesopotamia, architecture, and, urbanism, reflected, the, constant, engagement, with, the, divine, and, the, supernatural, and, many, ancient, cultures, resorted, to, monumentality, in, their, architecture, to, symbolically, represent, the, political, power, of, the, ruler, or, the, state, itself, the, architecture, and, urbanism, of, classical, civilizations, such, as, the, greek, and, roman, civilizations, evolved, from, civic, ideals, rather, than, religious, or, empirical, ones, new, building, types, emerged, and, architectural, style, developed, in, the, form, of, the, classical, orders, roman, architecture, was, influenced, by, greek, architecture, as, they, incorporated, many, greek, elements, into, their, building, practices, texts, on, architecture, have, been, written, since, ancient, times, these, texts, provided, both, general, advice, and, specific, formal, prescriptions, or, canons, some, examples, of, canons, are, found, in, the, writings, of, vitruvius, in, the, 1st, century, bc, some, of, the, most, important, early, examples, of, canonic, architecture, are, religious, asian, architecture, developed, differently, compared, to, europe, and, the, buddhist, hindu, and, sikh, architectural, styles, have, different, characteristics, unlike, indian, and, chinese, architecture, which, had, great, influence, on, the, surrounding, regions, japanese, architecture, did, not, some, asian, architecture, showed, great, regional, diversity, in, particular, buddhist, architecture, moreover, other, architectural, achievements, in, asia, is, the, hindu, temple, architecture, which, developed, from, around, the, 5th, century, ce, is, in, theory, governed, by, concepts, laid, down, in, the, shastras, and, is, concerned, with, expressing, the, macrocosm, and, the, microcosm, in, many, asian, countries, pantheistic, religion, led, to, architectural, forms, that, were, designed, specifically, to, enhance, the, natural, landscape, also, the, grandest, houses, were, relatively, lightweight, structures, mainly, using, wood, until, recent, times, and, there, are, few, survivals, of, great, age, buddhism, was, associated, with, a, move, to, stone, and, brick, religious, structures, probably, beginning, as, rock, cut, architecture, which, has, often, survived, very, well, early, asian, writings, on, architecture, include, the, kao, gong, ji, of, china, from, the, 7th, 5th, centuries, bc, the, shilpa, shastras, of, ancient, india, manjusri, vasthu, vidya, sastra, of, sri, lanka, and, araniko, of, nepal, islamic, architecture, began, in, the, 7th, century, incorporating, architectural, forms, from, the, ancient, middle, east, and, byzantium, but, also, developing, features, to, suit, the, religious, and, social, needs, of, the, society, examples, can, be, found, throughout, the, middle, east, turkey, north, africa, the, indian, sub, continent, and, in, parts, of, europe, such, as, spain, albania, and, the, balkan, states, as, the, result, of, the, expansion, of, the, ottoman, empire, in, europe, during, the, medieval, period, guilds, were, formed, by, craftsmen, to, organize, their, trades, and, written, contracts, have, survived, particularly, in, relation, to, ecclesiastical, buildings, the, role, of, architect, was, usually, one, with, that, of, master, mason, or, magister, lathomorum, as, they, are, sometimes, described, in, contemporary, documents, the, major, architectural, undertakings, were, the, buildings, of, abbeys, and, cathedrals, from, about, 900, onward, the, movements, of, both, clerics, and, tradesmen, carried, architectural, knowledge, across, europe, resulting, in, the, pan, european, styles, romanesque, and, gothic, also, a, significant, part, of, the, middle, ages, architectural, heritage, is, numerous, fortifications, across, the, continent, from, the, balkans, to, spain, and, from, malta, to, estonia, these, buildings, represent, an, important, part, of, european, heritage, in, renaissance, europe, from, about, 1400, onwards, there, was, a, revival, of, classical, learning, accompanied, by, the, development, of, renaissance, humanism, which, placed, greater, emphasis, on, the, role, of, the, individual, in, society, than, had, been, the, case, during, the, medieval, period, buildings, were, ascribed, to, specific, architects, brunelleschi, alberti, michelangelo, palladio, and, the, cult, of, the, individual, had, begun, there, was, still, no, dividing, line, between, artist, architect, and, engineer, or, any, of, the, related, vocations, and, the, appellation, was, often, one, of, regional, preference, a, revival, of, the, classical, style, in, architecture, was, accompanied, by, a, burgeoning, of, science, and, engineering, which, affected, the, proportions, and, structure, of, buildings, at, this, stage, it, was, still, possible, for, an, artist, to, design, a, bridge, as, the, level, of, structural, calculations, involved, was, within, the, scope, of, the, generalist, the, emerging, knowledge, in, scientific, fields, and, the, rise, of, new, materials, and, technology, architecture, and, engineering, began, to, separate, and, the, architect, began, to, concentrate, on, aesthetics, and, the, humanist, aspects, often, at, the, expense, of, technical, aspects, of, building, design, there, was, also, the, rise, of, the, gentleman, architect, who, usually, dealt, with, wealthy, clients, and, concentrated, predominantly, on, visual, qualities, derived, usually, from, historical, prototypes, typified, by, the, many, country, houses, of, great, britain, that, were, created, in, the, neo, gothic, or, scottish, baronial, styles, formal, architectural, training, in, the, 19th, century, for, example, at, cole, des, beaux, arts, in, france, gave, much, emphasis, to, the, production, of, beautiful, drawings, and, little, to, context, and, feasibility, meanwhile, the, industrial, revolution, laid, open, the, door, for, mass, production, and, consumption, aesthetics, became, a, criterion, for, the, middle, class, as, ornamented, products, once, within, the, province, of, expensive, craftsmanship, became, cheaper, under, machine, production, vernacular, architecture, became, increasingly, ornamental, housebuilders, could, use, current, architectural, design, in, their, work, by, combining, features, found, in, pattern, books, and, architectural, journals, around, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, general, dissatisfaction, with, the, emphasis, on, revivalist, architecture, and, elaborate, decoration, gave, rise, to, many, new, lines, of, thought, that, served, as, precursors, to, modern, architecture, notable, among, these, is, the, deutscher, werkbund, formed, in, 1907, to, produce, better, quality, machine, made, objects, the, rise, of, the, profession, of, industrial, design, is, usually, placed, here, following, this, lead, the, bauhaus, school, founded, in, weimar, germany, in, 1919, redefined, the, architectural, bounds, prior, set, throughout, history, viewing, the, creation, of, a, building, as, the, ultimate, synthesis, the, apex, of, art, craft, and, technology, when, modern, architecture, was, first, practiced, it, was, an, avant, garde, movement, with, moral, philosophical, and, aesthetic, underpinnings, immediately, after, world, war, i, pioneering, modernist, architects, sought, to, develop, a, completely, new, style, appropriate, for, a, new, post, war, social, and, economic, order, focused, on, meeting, the, needs, of, the, middle, and, working, classes, they, rejected, the, architectural, practice, of, the, academic, refinement, of, historical, styles, which, served, the, rapidly, declining, aristocratic, order, the, approach, of, the, modernist, architects, was, to, reduce, buildings, to, pure, forms, removing, historical, references, and, ornament, in, favor, of, functional, details, buildings, displayed, their, functional, and, structural, elements, exposing, steel, beams, and, concrete, surfaces, instead, of, hiding, them, behind, decorative, forms, architects, such, as, frank, lloyd, wright, developed, organic, architecture, in, which, the, form, was, defined, by, its, environment, and, purpose, with, an, aim, to, promote, harmony, between, human, habitation, and, the, natural, world, with, prime, examples, being, robie, house, and, fallingwater, architects, such, as, mies, van, der, rohe, philip, johnson, and, marcel, breuer, worked, to, create, beauty, based, on, the, inherent, qualities, of, building, materials, and, modern, construction, techniques, trading, traditional, historic, forms, for, simplified, geometric, forms, celebrating, the, new, means, and, methods, made, possible, by, the, industrial, revolution, including, steel, frame, construction, which, gave, birth, to, high, rise, superstructures, fazlur, rahman, khan, s, development, of, the, tube, structure, was, a, technological, break, through, in, building, ever, higher, by, mid, century, modernism, had, morphed, into, the, international, style, an, aesthetic, epitomized, in, many, ways, by, the, twin, towers, of, new, york, s, world, trade, center, designed, by, minoru, yamasaki, many, architects, resisted, modernism, finding, it, devoid, of, the, decorative, richness, of, historical, styles, as, the, first, generation, of, modernists, began, to, die, after, world, war, ii, the, second, generation, of, architects, including, paul, rudolph, marcel, breuer, and, eero, saarinen, tried, to, expand, the, aesthetics, of, modernism, with, brutalism, buildings, with, expressive, sculpture, fa, ades, made, of, unfinished, concrete, but, an, even, younger, postwar, generation, critiqued, modernism, and, brutalism, for, being, too, austere, standardized, monotone, and, not, taking, into, account, the, richness, of, human, experience, offered, in, historical, buildings, across, time, and, in, different, places, and, cultures, one, such, reaction, to, the, cold, aesthetic, of, modernism, and, brutalism, is, the, school, of, metaphoric, architecture, which, includes, such, things, as, bio, morphism, and, zoomorphic, architecture, both, using, nature, as, the, primary, source, of, inspiration, and, design, while, it, is, considered, by, some, to, be, merely, an, aspect, of, postmodernism, others, consider, it, to, be, a, school, in, its, own, right, and, a, later, development, of, expressionist, architecture, beginning, in, the, late, 1950s, and, 1960s, architectural, phenomenology, emerged, as, an, important, movement, in, the, early, reaction, against, modernism, with, architects, like, charles, moore, in, the, united, states, christian, norberg, schulz, in, norway, and, ernesto, nathan, rogers, and, vittorio, gregotti, michele, valori, bruno, zevi, in, italy, who, collectively, popularized, an, interest, in, a, new, contemporary, architecture, aimed, at, expanding, human, experience, using, historical, buildings, as, models, and, precedents, postmodernism, produced, a, style, that, combined, contemporary, building, technology, and, cheap, materials, with, the, aesthetics, of, older, pre, modern, and, non, modern, styles, from, high, classical, architecture, to, popular, or, vernacular, regional, building, styles, robert, venturi, famously, defined, postmodern, architecture, as, a, decorated, shed, an, ordinary, building, which, is, functionally, designed, inside, and, embellished, on, the, outside, and, upheld, it, against, modernist, and, brutalist, ducks, buildings, with, unnecessarily, expressive, tectonic, forms, since, the, 1980s, as, the, complexity, of, buildings, began, to, increase, in, terms, of, structural, systems, services, energy, and, technologies, the, field, of, architecture, became, multi, disciplinary, with, specializations, for, each, project, type, technological, expertise, or, project, delivery, methods, moreover, there, has, been, an, increased, separation, of, the, design, architect, from, the, project, architect, who, ensures, that, the, project, meets, the, required, standards, and, deals, with, matters, of, liability, the, preparatory, processes, for, the, design, of, any, large, building, have, become, increasingly, complicated, and, require, preliminary, studies, of, such, matters, as, durability, sustainability, quality, money, and, compliance, with, local, laws, a, large, structure, can, no, longer, be, the, design, of, one, person, but, must, be, the, work, of, many, modernism, and, postmodernism, have, been, criticized, by, some, members, of, the, architectural, profession, who, feel, that, successful, architecture, is, not, a, personal, philosophical, or, aesthetic, pursuit, by, individualists, rather, it, has, to, consider, everyday, needs, of, people, and, use, technology, to, create, livable, environments, with, the, design, process, being, informed, by, studies, of, behavioral, environmental, and, social, sciences, environmental, sustainability, has, become, a, mainstream, issue, with, a, profound, effect, on, the, architectural, profession, many, developers, those, who, support, the, financing, of, buildings, have, become, educated, to, encourage, the, facilitation, of, environmentally, sustainable, design, rather, than, solutions, based, primarily, on, immediate, cost, major, examples, of, this, can, be, found, in, passive, solar, building, design, greener, roof, designs, biodegradable, materials, and, more, attention, to, a, structure, s, energy, usage, this, major, shift, in, architecture, has, also, changed, architecture, schools, to, focus, more, on, the, environment, there, has, been, an, acceleration, in, the, number, of, buildings, that, seek, to, meet, green, building, sustainable, design, principles, sustainable, practices, that, were, at, the, core, of, vernacular, architecture, increasingly, provide, inspiration, for, environmentally, and, socially, sustainable, contemporary, techniques, the, u, s, green, building, council, s, leed, leadership, in, energy, and, environmental, design, rating, system, has, been, instrumental, in, this, concurrently, the, recent, movements, of, new, urbanism, metaphoric, architecture, complementary, architecture, and, new, classical, architecture, promote, a, sustainable, approach, towards, construction, that, appreciates, and, develops, smart, growth, architectural, tradition, and, classical, design, this, in, contrast, to, modernist, and, globally, uniform, architecture, as, well, as, leaning, against, solitary, housing, estates, and, suburban, sprawl, glass, curtain, walls, which, were, the, hallmark, of, the, ultra, modern, urban, life, in, many, countries, surfaced, even, in, developing, countries, like, nigeria, where, international, styles, had, been, represented, since, the, mid, 20th, century, mostly, because, of, the, leanings, of, foreign, trained, architects, residential, architecture, is, the, design, of, functional, fits, the, user, s, lifestyle, while, adhering, to, the, building, codes, and, zoning, laws, commercial, architecture, is, the, design, of, commercial, buildings, that, serves, the, needs, of, businesses, the, government, and, religious, institutions, industrial, architecture, is, the, design, of, specialized, industrial, buildings, whose, primary, focus, is, designing, buildings, that, can, fulfil, their, function, while, ensuring, the, safe, movement, of, labor, and, goods, in, the, facility, landscape, architecture, is, the, design, of, outdoor, public, areas, landmarks, and, structures, to, achieve, environmental, social, behavioral, or, aesthetic, outcomes, it, involves, the, systematic, investigation, of, existing, social, ecological, and, soil, conditions, and, processes, in, the, landscape, and, the, design, of, interventions, that, will, produce, the, desired, outcome, the, scope, of, the, profession, includes, landscape, design, site, planning, stormwater, management, environmental, restoration, parks, and, recreation, planning, visual, resource, management, green, infrastructure, planning, and, provision, and, private, estate, and, residence, landscape, master, planning, and, design, all, at, varying, scales, of, design, planning, and, management, a, practitioner, in, the, profession, of, landscape, architecture, is, called, a, landscape, architect, interior, architecture, is, the, design, of, a, space, which, has, been, created, by, structural, boundaries, and, the, human, interaction, within, these, boundaries, it, can, also, be, the, initial, design, and, plan, for, use, then, later, redesigned, to, accommodate, a, changed, purpose, or, a, significantly, revised, design, for, adaptive, reuse, of, the, building, shell, the, latter, is, often, part, of, sustainable, architecture, practices, conserving, resources, through, recycling, a, structure, by, adaptive, redesign, generally, referred, to, as, the, spatial, art, of, environmental, design, form, and, practice, interior, architecture, is, the, process, through, which, the, interiors, of, buildings, are, designed, concerned, with, all, aspects, of, the, human, uses, of, structural, spaces, urban, design, is, the, process, of, designing, and, shaping, the, physical, features, of, cities, towns, and, villages, in, contrast, to, architecture, which, focuses, on, the, design, of, individual, buildings, urban, design, deals, with, the, larger, scale, of, groups, of, buildings, streets, and, public, spaces, whole, neighborhoods, and, districts, and, entire, cities, with, the, goal, of, making, urban, areas, functional, attractive, and, sustainable, urban, design, is, an, interdisciplinary, field, that, uses, elements, of, many, built, environment, professions, including, landscape, architecture, urban, planning, architecture, civil, engineering, and, municipal, engineering, it, is, common, for, professionals, in, all, these, disciplines, to, practice, urban, design, in, more, recent, times, different, sub, subfields, of, urban, design, have, emerged, such, as, strategic, urban, design, landscape, urbanism, water, sensitive, urban, design, and, sustainable, urbanism, naval, architecture, also, known, as, naval, engineering, is, an, engineering, discipline, dealing, with, the, engineering, design, process, shipbuilding, maintenance, and, operation, of, marine, vessels, and, structures, naval, architecture, involves, basic, and, applied, research, design, development, design, evaluation, and, calculations, during, all, stages, of, the, life, of, a, marine, vehicle, preliminary, design, of, the, vessel, its, detailed, design, construction, trials, operation, and, maintenance, launching, and, dry, docking, are, the, main, activities, involved, ship, design, calculations, are, also, required, for, ships, being, modified, by, means, of, conversion, rebuilding, modernization, or, repair, naval, architecture, also, involves, the, formulation, of, safety, regulations, and, damage, control, rules, and, the, approval, and, certification, of, ship, designs, to, meet, statutory, and, non, statutory, requirements, architecture, is, used, as, a, metaphor, for, many, modern, techniques, or, fields, for, structuring, abstractions, these, include, the, term, seismic, architecture, or, earthquake, architecture, was, first, introduced, in, 1985, by, robert, reitherman, the, phrase, earthquake, architecture, is, used, to, describe, a, degree, of, architectural, expression, of, earthquake, resistance, or, implication, of, architectural, configuration, form, or, style, in, earthquake, resistance, it, is, also, used, to, describe, buildings, in, which, seismic, design, considerations, impacted, its, architecture, it, may, be, considered, a, new, aesthetic, approach, in, designing, structures, in, seismic, prone, areas, the, wide, breadth, of, expressive, possibilities, ranges, from, metaphorical, uses, of, seismic, issues, to, the, more, straightforward, exposure, of, seismic, technology, while, outcomes, of, an, earthquake, architecture, can, be, very, diverse, in, their, physical, manifestations, architectural, expression, of, seismic, principles, can, also, take, many, forms, and, levels, of, sophistication
