kabuki, theatre, in, 1629, kabuki, developed, throughout, the, late, 17th, century, and, reached, its, zenith, in, the, mid, 18th, century, in, 2005, kabuki, theatre, was, proclaimed, by, unesco, as, an, intangible, heritage, possessing, outstanding, universal, value, in, 2008, it, was, inscribed, in, the, unesco, representative, list, of, the, intangible, cultural, heritage, of, humanity, the, individual, kanji, that, make, up, the, word, kabuki, can, be, read, as, sing, dance, and, skill, kabuki, is, therefore, sometimes, translated, as, the, art, of, singing, and, dancing, these, are, however, ateji, characters, which, do, not, reflect, actual, etymology, the, kanji, of, skill, generally, refers, to, a, performer, in, kabuki, theatre, since, the, word, kabuki, is, believed, to, derive, from, the, verb, kabuku, meaning, to, lean, or, to, be, out, of, the, ordinary, the, word, kabuki, can, also, be, interpreted, as, avant, garde, or, bizarre, theatre, the, expression, kabukimono, referred, originally, to, those, who, were, bizarrely, dressed, it, is, often, translated, into, english, as, strange, things, or, the, crazy, ones, and, referred, to, the, style, of, dress, worn, by, gangs, of, samurai, the, history, of, kabuki, began, in, 1603, during, the, edo, period, when, former, shrine, maiden, izumo, no, okuni, possibly, a, miko, of, izumo, taisha, began, performing, with, a, troupe, of, young, female, dancers, a, new, simple, style, of, dance, drama, in, pantomime, on, a, makeshift, stage, in, the, dry, bed, of, the, kamo, river, in, kyoto, in, the, earliest, forms, of, kabuki, female, performers, played, both, men, and, women, in, comic, playlets, about, ordinary, life, it, did, not, take, long, for, the, style, to, become, popular, and, okuni, was, asked, to, perform, before, the, imperial, court, in, the, wake, of, such, success, rival, troupes, quickly, formed, and, kabuki, was, born, as, ensemble, dance, and, drama, performed, by, women, much, of, the, appeal, of, kabuki, in, this, era, was, due, to, the, ribald, suggestive, themes, featured, by, many, troupes, this, appeal, was, further, augmented, by, the, fact, that, many, performers, were, also, involved, in, prostitution, for, this, reason, kabuki, was, also, known, as, prostitute, kabuki, during, this, period, kabuki, became, a, common, form, of, entertainment, in, the, red, light, districts, of, japan, especially, in, yoshiwara, the, registered, red, light, district, in, edo, the, widespread, appeal, of, kabuki, often, meant, that, a, diverse, crowd, of, different, social, classes, gathered, to, watch, performances, a, unique, occurrence, that, happened, nowhere, else, in, the, city, of, edo, kabuki, theatres, became, well, known, as, a, place, to, both, see, and, be, seen, in, terms, of, fashion, and, style, as, the, audience, commonly, comprising, a, number, of, socially, low, but, economically, wealthy, merchants, typically, used, a, performance, as, a, way, to, feature, the, fashion, trends, as, an, art, form, kabuki, also, provided, inventive, new, forms, of, entertainment, featuring, new, musical, styles, played, on, the, shamisen, clothes, and, fashion, often, dramatic, in, appearance, famous, actors, and, stories, often, intended, to, mirror, current, events, performances, typically, lasted, from, morning, until, sunset, with, surrounding, teahouses, providing, meals, refreshments, and, place, to, socialise, the, area, surrounding, kabuki, theatres, also, featured, a, number, of, shops, selling, kabuki, souvenirs, after, performances, women, performers, would, offer, sexual, services, for, those, who, could, afford, it, since, fights, would, usually, erupt, among, the, young, samurai, patrons, shogunal, authorities, who, wanted, to, maintain, order, banned, women, from, performing, on, stage, following, this, ban, okuni, replaced, the, women, with, boys, in, kabuki, performances, during, the, early, seventeenth, century, within, a, culture, where, pederasty, was, pervasive, among, samurai, her, decision, didn, t, significantly, harm, the, theater, s, popularity, in, fact, it, may, have, even, benefited, kabuki, as, it, caught, the, attention, of, the, third, shogun, iemitsu, known, for, his, interest, in, pederasty, he, even, arranged, special, performances, however, after, iemitsu, s, death, in, 1651, and, with, samurai, now, fighting, for, the, attention, of, boys, rather, than, girls, the, shogunate, imposed, further, restrictions, allowing, only, males, over, 15, to, perform, on, stage, kabuki, switched, to, adult, male, actors, called, yaro, kabuki, in, the, mid, 1600s, adult, male, actors, however, continued, to, play, both, female, and, male, characters, and, kabuki, retained, its, popularity, remaining, a, key, element, of, the, edo, period, urban, life, style, although, kabuki, was, performed, widely, across, japan, the, nakamura, za, ichimura, za, and, kawarazaki, za, theatres, became, the, most, widely, known, and, popular, kabuki, theatres, where, some, of, the, most, successful, kabuki, performances, were, and, still, are, held, during, the, time, period, of, 1628, 1673, the, modern, version, of, all, male, kabuki, actors, a, style, of, kabuki, known, as, yar, kabuki, lit, young, man, kabuki, was, established, following, the, ban, on, women, and, young, boys, cross, dressing, male, actors, known, as, onnagata, lit, woman, role, or, oyama, took, over, previously, female, or, wakashu, acted, roles, young, adolescent, men, were, still, preferred, for, women, s, roles, due, to, their, less, obviously, masculine, appearance, and, the, higher, pitch, of, their, voices, the, roles, of, adolescent, men, in, kabuki, known, as, wakashu, were, also, played, by, young, men, often, selected, for, their, attractiveness, this, became, a, common, practice, and, wakashu, were, often, presented, in, an, erotic, context, the, focus, of, kabuki, performances, also, increasingly, began, to, emphasise, drama, alongside, dance, however, the, ribald, nature, of, kabuki, performances, continued, with, male, actors, also, engaging, in, sex, work, for, both, female, and, male, customers, audiences, frequently, became, rowdy, and, brawls, occasionally, broke, out, sometimes, over, the, favors, of, a, particularly, popular, or, handsome, actor, leading, the, shogunate, to, ban, first, onnagata, and, then, wakash, roles, for, a, short, period, of, time, both, bans, were, rescinded, by, 1652, during, the, genroku, period, kabuki, thrived, with, the, structure, of, kabuki, plays, formalising, into, the, structure, they, are, performed, in, today, alongside, many, other, elements, which, eventually, came, to, be, recognised, as, a, key, aspect, of, kabuki, tradition, such, as, conventional, character, tropes, kabuki, theater, and, ningy, j, ruri, an, elaborate, form, of, puppet, theater, later, known, as, bunraku, became, closely, associated, with, each, other, mutually, influencing, the, other, s, further, development, the, famous, playwright, chikamatsu, monzaemon, one, of, the, first, professional, kabuki, playwrights, produced, several, influential, works, during, this, time, though, the, piece, usually, acknowledged, as, his, most, significant, sonezaki, shinj, the, love, suicides, at, sonezaki, was, originally, written, for, bunraku, like, many, bunraku, plays, it, was, adapted, for, kabuki, eventually, becoming, popular, enough, to, reportedly, inspire, a, number, of, real, life, copycat, suicides, and, leading, to, a, government, ban, on, shinju, mono, plays, about, love, suicides, in, 1723, also, during, the, genroku, period, was, the, development, of, the, mie, style, of, posing, credited, to, kabuki, actor, ichikawa, danj, r, i, alongside, the, development, of, the, mask, like, kumadori, makeup, worn, by, kabuki, actors, in, some, plays, in, the, mid, 18th, century, kabuki, fell, out, of, favor, for, a, time, with, bunraku, taking, its, place, as, the, premier, form, of, stage, entertainment, among, the, lower, social, classes, this, occurred, partly, because, of, the, emergence, of, several, skilled, bunraku, playwrights, in, that, time, little, of, note, would, occur, in, the, further, development, of, kabuki, until, the, end, of, the, century, when, it, began, to, reemerge, in, popularity, in, the, 1840s, repeated, periods, of, drought, led, to, a, series, of, fires, affecting, edo, with, kabuki, theatres, traditionally, made, of, wood, frequently, burning, down, forcing, many, to, relocate, when, the, area, that, housed, the, nakamura, za, was, completely, destroyed, in, 1841, the, sh, gun, refused, to, allow, the, theatre, to, be, rebuilt, saying, that, it, was, against, fire, code, the, shogunate, mostly, disapproving, of, the, socialisation, and, trade, that, occurred, in, kabuki, theatres, between, merchants, actors, and, prostitutes, took, advantage, of, the, fire, crisis, in, the, following, year, forcing, the, nakamura, za, ichimura, za, and, kawarazaki, za, out, of, the, city, limits, and, into, asakusa, a, northern, suburb, of, edo, this, was, part, of, the, larger, tenp, reforms, that, the, shogunate, instituted, starting, in, 1842, to, restrict, the, overindulgence, of, pleasures, actors, stagehands, and, others, associated, with, the, performances, were, also, forced, to, move, as, a, result, of, the, death, of, their, livelihood, despite, the, move, of, everyone, involved, in, kabuki, performance, and, many, in, the, surrounding, areas, to, the, new, location, of, the, theatres, the, inconvenience, of, the, distance, led, to, a, reduction, in, attendance, these, factors, along, with, strict, regulations, pushed, much, of, kabuki, underground, in, edo, with, performances, changing, locations, to, avoid, the, authorities, the, theatres, new, location, was, called, saruwaka, ch, or, saruwaka, machi, the, last, thirty, years, of, the, tokugawa, shogunate, s, rule, is, often, referred, to, as, the, saruwaka, machi, period, and, is, well, known, for, having, produced, some, of, the, most, exaggerated, kabuki, in, japanese, history, saruwaka, machi, became, the, new, theatre, district, for, the, nakamura, za, ichimura, za, and, kawarazaki, za, theatres, the, district, was, located, on, the, main, street, of, asakusa, which, ran, through, the, middle, of, the, small, city, the, street, was, renamed, after, saruwaka, kanzaburo, who, initiated, edo, kabuki, in, the, nakamura, za, in, 1624, european, artists, began, noticing, japanese, theatrical, performances, and, artwork, and, many, artists, such, as, claude, monet, were, inspired, by, japanese, woodblock, prints, this, western, interest, prompted, japanese, artists, to, increase, their, depictions, of, daily, life, including, the, depiction, of, theatres, brothels, main, streets, and, so, on, one, artist, utagawa, hiroshige, produced, a, series, of, prints, based, on, saruwaka, from, the, saruwaka, machi, period, in, asakusa, despite, the, revival, of, kabuki, in, another, location, the, relocation, diminished, the, tradition, s, most, abundant, inspirations, for, costuming, make, up, and, storylines, ichikawa, kodanji, iv, was, considered, one, of, the, most, active, and, successful, actors, during, the, saruwaka, machi, period, deemed, unattractive, he, mainly, performed, buy, or, dancing, in, dramas, written, by, kawatake, mokuami, who, also, wrote, during, the, meiji, era, to, follow, kawatake, mokuami, commonly, wrote, plays, that, depicted, the, common, lives, of, the, people, of, edo, he, introduced, shichigo, cho, seven, and, five, syllable, meter, dialogue, and, music, such, as, kiyomoto, his, kabuki, performances, became, quite, popular, once, the, saruwaka, machi, period, ended, and, theatre, returned, to, edo, many, of, his, works, are, still, performed, in, 1868, the, tokugawa, ceased, to, exist, with, the, restoration, of, the, emperor, emperor, meiji, was, restored, to, power, and, moved, from, kyoto, to, the, new, capital, of, edo, or, tokyo, beginning, the, meiji, period, kabuki, once, again, returned, to, the, pleasure, quarters, of, edo, and, throughout, the, meiji, period, became, increasingly, more, radical, as, modern, styles, of, kabuki, plays, and, performances, emerged, playwrights, experimented, with, the, introduction, of, new, genres, to, kabuki, and, introduced, twists, on, traditional, stories, beginning, in, 1868, enormous, cultural, changes, such, as, the, fall, of, the, tokugawa, shogunate, the, elimination, of, the, samurai, class, and, the, opening, of, japan, to, the, west, helped, to, spark, kabuki, s, re, emergence, both, actors, and, playwrights, strove, to, improve, the, reputation, of, kabuki, in, the, face, of, new, foreign, influence, and, amongst, the, upper, classes, partially, through,

pieces, jidaimono, or, history, plays, are, set, within, the, context, of, major, events, in, japanese, history, strict, censorship, laws, during, the, edo, period, prohibited, the, representation, of, contemporary, events, and, particularly, prohibited, criticising, the, shogunate, or, casting, it, in, a, bad, light, although, enforcement, varied, greatly, over, the, years, many, shows, were, set, in, the, context, of, the, genpei, war, of, the, 1180s, the, nanboku, ch, wars, of, the, 1330s, or, other, historical, events, frustrating, the, censors, many, shows, used, these, historical, settings, as, metaphors, for, contemporary, events, kanadehon, ch, shingura, one, of, the, most, famous, plays, in, the, kabuki, repertoire, serves, as, an, excellent, example, it, is, ostensibly, set, in, the, 1330s, though, it, actually, depicts, the, contemporary, 18th, century, affair, of, the, revenge, of, the, 47, r, nin, unlike, jidaimono, which, generally, focused, upon, the, samurai, class, sewamono, focused, primarily, upon, commoners, namely, townspeople, and, peasants, often, referred, to, as, domestic, plays, in, english, sewamono, generally, related, to, themes, of, family, drama, and, romance, some, of, the, most, famous, sewamono, are, the, love, suicide, plays, adapted, from, works, by, the, bunraku, playwright, chikamatsu, these, center, on, romantic, couples, who, cannot, be, together, in, life, due, to, various, circumstances, and, who, therefore, decide, to, be, together, in, death, instead, many, if, not, most, sewamono, contain, significant, elements, of, this, theme, of, societal, pressures, and, limitations, shosagoto, pieces, place, their, emphasis, on, dance, which, may, be, performed, with, or, without, dialogue, where, dance, can, be, used, to, convey, emotion, character, and, plot, quick, costume, change, techniques, may, sometimes, be, employed, in, such, pieces, notable, examples, include, musume, d, j, ji, and, renjishi, nagauta, musicians, may, be, seated, in, rows, on, stepped, platforms, behind, the, dancers, important, elements, of, kabuki, include, the, mie, in, which, the, actor, holds, a, picturesque, pose, to, establish, his, character, at, this, point, his, house, name, yag, is, sometimes, heard, in, loud, shout, kakegoe, from, an, expert, audience, member, serving, both, to, express, and, enhance, the, audience, s, appreciation, of, the, actor, s, achievement, an, even, greater, compliment, can, be, paid, by, shouting, the, name, of, the, actor, s, father, the, main, actor, has, to, convey, a, wide, variety, of, emotions, between, a, fallen, drunkard, person, and, someone, who, in, reality, is, quite, different, since, he, is, only, faking, his, weakness, such, as, the, character, of, yuranosuke, in, ch, shingura, this, is, called, hara, gei, or, belly, acting, which, means, he, has, to, perform, from, within, to, change, characters, it, is, technically, difficult, to, perform, and, takes, a, long, time, to, learn, but, once, mastered, the, audience, takes, up, on, the, actor, s, emotion, emotions, are, also, expressed, through, the, colours, of, the, costumes, a, key, element, in, kabuki, gaudy, and, strong, colours, can, convey, foolish, or, joyful, emotions, whereas, severe, or, muted, colours, convey, seriousness, and, focus, kabuki, like, other, forms, of, drama, traditionally, performed, in, japan, was, and, sometimes, still, is, performed, in, full, day, programmes, with, one, play, comprising, a, number, of, acts, spanning, the, entire, day, however, these, plays, particularly, sewamono, were, commonly, sequenced, with, acts, from, other, plays, in, order, to, produce, a, full, day, programme, as, the, individual, acts, in, a, kabuki, play, commonly, functioned, as, stand, alone, performances, in, and, of, themselves, sewamono, plays, in, contrast, were, generally, not, sequenced, with, acts, from, other, plays, and, genuinely, would, take, the, entire, day, to, perform, the, structure, of, a, full, day, performance, was, derived, largely, from, the, conventions, of, both, bunraku, and, noh, theatre, chief, amongst, these, was, the, concept, of, jo, ha, ky, a, pacing, convention, in, theatre, stating, that, the, action, of, a, play, should, start, slow, speed, up, and, end, quickly, the, concept, elaborated, on, at, length, by, master, noh, playwright, zeami, governs, not, only, the, actions, of, the, actors, but, also, the, structure, of, the, play, as, well, as, the, structure, of, scenes, and, plays, within, a, day, long, programme, nearly, every, full, length, play, occupies, five, acts, the, first, corresponds, to, jo, an, auspicious, and, slow, opening, which, introduces, the, audience, to, the, characters, and, the, plot, the, next, three, acts, correspond, to, ha, where, events, speed, up, culminating, almost, always, in, a, great, moment, of, drama, or, tragedy, in, the, third, act, and, possibly, a, battle, in, the, second, or, fourth, acts, the, final, act, corresponding, to, ky, is, almost, always, short, providing, a, quick, and, satisfying, conclusion, while, many, plays, were, written, solely, for, kabuki, many, others, were, taken, from, j, ruri, plays, noh, plays, folklore, or, other, performing, traditions, such, as, the, oral, tradition, of, the, tale, of, the, heike, while, j, ruri, plays, tend, to, have, serious, emotionally, dramatic, and, organised, plots, plays, written, specifically, for, kabuki, generally, have, looser, more, humorous, plots, one, crucial, difference, between, j, ruri, and, kabuki, is, a, difference, in, storytelling, focus, whereas, j, ruri, focuses, on, the, story, and, on, the, chanter, who, recites, it, kabuki, has, a, greater, focus, on, the, actors, themselves, a, j, ruri, play, may, sacrifice, the, details, of, sets, puppets, or, action, in, favor, of, the, chanter, while, kabuki, is, known, to, sacrifice, drama, and, even, the, plot, to, highlight, an, actor, s, talents, it, was, not, uncommon, in, kabuki, to, insert, or, remove, individual, scenes, from, a, day, s, schedule, in, order, to, cater, to, an, individual, actor, either, scenes, he, was, famed, for, or, that, featured, him, would, be, inserted, into, a, program, without, regard, to, plot, continuity, certain, plays, were, also, performed, uncommonly, as, they, required, an, actor, to, be, proficient, in, a, number, of, instruments, which, would, be, played, live, onstage, a, skill, that, few, actors, possessed, kabuki, traditions, in, edo, and, the, kyoto, osaka, region, kamigata, differed, throughout, the, edo, period, edo, kabuki, was, defined, by, its, extravagance, both, in, the, appearance, of, its, actors, their, costumes, stage, tricks, and, bold, mie, poses, in, contrast, kamigata, kabuki, focused, on, natural, and, realistic, styles, of, acting, only, towards, the, end, of, the, edo, period, did, the, two, styles, begin, to, merge, to, any, significant, degree, before, this, time, actors, from, different, regions, often, failed, to, adjust, their, acting, styles, when, performing, elsewhere, leading, to, unsuccessful, performance, tours, outside, of, their, usual, region, of, performance, while, there, are, many, famous, plays, known, today, many, of, the, most, famous, were, written, in, the, mid, edo, period, and, were, originally, written, for, bunraku, theatre, every, kabuki, actor, has, a, stage, name, which, is, different, from, the, name, they, were, born, with, these, stage, names, most, often, those, of, the, actor, s, father, grandfather, or, teacher, are, passed, down, between, generations, of, actors, lineages, and, hold, great, honor, and, importance, many, names, are, associated, with, certain, roles, or, acting, styles, and, the, new, possessor, of, each, name, must, live, up, to, these, expectations, there, is, the, feeling, almost, of, the, actor, not, only, taking, a, name, but, embodying, the, spirit, style, or, skill, of, each, actor, to, previously, hold, that, name, many, actors, will, go, through, at, least, three, names, over, the, course, of, their, career, sh, mei, name, succession, are, grand, naming, ceremonies, held, in, kabuki, theatres, in, front, of, the, audience, most, often, a, number, of, actors, will, participate, in, a, single, ceremony, taking, on, new, stage, names, their, participation, in, a, sh, mei, represents, their, passage, into, a, new, chapter, of, their, performing, careers, kabuki, actors, are, typically, part, of, a, school, of, acting, or, are, associated, with, a, particular, theatre, since, its, beginning, kabuki, has, remained, a, significant, piece, of, japanese, culture, the, stories, and, actors, have, been, recreated, in, many, different, art, forms, including, woodblock, prints, books, magazines, oral, storytelling, photography, in, later, years, and, others, additionally, kabuki, was, and, continues, to, be, influenced, by, the, books, and, stories, circulating, in, japan, in, one, such, instance, the, widely, popular, book, nans, satomi, hakkenden, or, eight, dogs, was, acted, out, in, various, episodes, on, the, kabuki, stage, one, important, way, the, laboring, class, was, able, to, enjoy, kabuki, performances, outside, of, the, stage, was, through, home, brewed, shows, called, noson, kabuki, village, kabuki, also, referred, to, as, amateur, kabuki, these, performances, took, place, at, the, local, level, across, japan, but, were, most, commonly, held, in, the, gifu, and, aichi, prefectures, in, gifu, prefecture, specifically, noson, kabuki, was, a, prominent, feature, of, the, annual, autumn, festival, with, children, s, reenactments, of, kabuki, performances, taking, place, at, murakuni, shrine, for, over, 300, years, closer, to, the, cultural, epicenter, of, kabuki, in, edo, later, tokyo, commoners, had, other, methods, to, enjoy, performances, without, attending, the, shows, bunraku, puppet, theatre, was, a, type, of, performance, shorter, in, length, and, more, affordable, to, the, common, class, than, kabuki, bunraku, performances, were, often, based, on, plots, used, in, kabuki, and, the, two, styles, shared, common, themes, kabuki, shinp, kabuki, news, was, another, popular, medium, for, kabuki, consumption, among, commoners, and, elites, alike, during, the, course, of, its, publication, this, magazine, allowed, those, unable, to, attend, performances, to, enjoy, the, liveliness, of, kabuki, culture
