the, term, sonnet, derives, from, the, italian, word, sonetto, lit, little, song, from, the, latin, word, sonus, lit, sound, it, refers, to, a, fixed, verse, poetic, form, traditionally, consisting, of, fourteen, lines, adhering, to, a, set, rhyming, scheme, originating, in, 13th, century, sicily, the, sonnet, was, in, time, taken, up, in, many, european, language, areas, mainly, to, express, romantic, love, at, first, although, eventually, any, subject, was, considered, acceptable, many, formal, variations, were, also, introduced, including, abandonment, of, the, quatorzain, limit, and, even, of, rhyme, altogether, in, modern, times, giacomo, da, lentini, is, credited, with, the, sonnet, s, invention, at, the, court, of, frederick, ii, in, the, sicilian, city, of, palermo, the, sicilian, school, of, poets, who, surrounded, lentini, then, spread, the, form, to, the, mainland, those, earliest, sonnets, no, longer, survive, in, the, original, sicilian, language, however, but, only, after, being, translated, into, tuscan, dialect, the, form, consisted, of, a, pair, of, quatrains, followed, by, a, pair, of, tercets, with, the, symmetrical, rhyme, scheme, abababab, cdcdcd, where, the, sense, is, carried, forward, in, a, new, direction, after, the, midway, break, peter, dronke, has, commented, that, there, was, something, intrinsic, to, its, flexible, form, that, contributed, to, the, sonnet, s, survival, far, beyond, its, region, of, origin, william, baer, suggests, that, the, first, eight, lines, of, the, earliest, sicilian, sonnets, are, identical, to, the, eight, line, sicilian, folksong, stanza, known, as, the, strambotto, to, this, da, lentini, or, whoever, else, invented, the, form, added, two, tercets, to, the, strambotto, in, order, to, create, the, new, 14, line, sonnet, form, in, contrast, hassanally, ladha, has, argued, that, the, sicilian, sonnet, s, structure, and, content, drew, upon, arabic, poetry, and, cannot, be, explained, as, the, invention, of, the, sicilian, school, of, poets, ladha, notes, that, in, its, sicilian, beginnings, the, sonnet, evinces, literary, and, epistemological, contact, with, the, qasida, and, emphasizes, that, the, sonnet, did, not, emerge, simultaneously, with, its, supposedly, defining, 14, line, structure, tellingly, attempts, to, close, off, the, sonnet, from, its, arabic, predecessors, depend, upon, a, definition, of, the, new, lyric, to, which, giacomo, s, poetry, does, not, conform, surviving, in, thirteenth, century, recensions, his, poems, appear, not, in, fourteen, but, rather, six, lines, including, four, rows, each, with, two, hemistiches, and, two, tercets, each, in, a, line, extending, over, two, rows, in, ladha, s, view, the, sonnet, emerges, as, the, continuation, of, a, broader, tradition, of, love, poetry, throughout, the, mediterranean, world, and, relates, to, such, other, forms, as, the, sicilian, strambotto, the, proven, al, canso, the, andalusi, arabic, muwashshah, and, zajal, as, well, as, the, qasida, guittone, d, arezzo, rediscovered, the, sonnet, form, and, brought, it, to, tuscany, where, he, adapted, it, to, tuscan, dialect, when, he, founded, the, siculo, tuscan, or, guittonian, school, of, poetry, 1235, 1294, he, wrote, almost, 250, sonnets, among, the, host, of, other, italian, poets, that, followed, the, sonnets, of, dante, alighieri, and, guido, cavalcanti, stand, out, but, later, the, most, famous, and, widely, influential, was, petrarch, the, structure, of, a, typical, italian, sonnet, as, it, developed, included, two, parts, that, together, formed, a, compact, form, of, argument, first, the, octave, forms, the, proposition, which, describes, a, problem, or, question, followed, by, a, sestet, two, tercets, that, proposes, a, resolution, typically, the, ninth, line, initiates, what, is, called, the, turn, or, volta, which, signals, the, move, from, proposition, to, resolution, even, in, sonnets, that, do, not, strictly, follow, the, problem, resolution, structure, the, ninth, line, still, often, marks, a, turn, by, signaling, a, change, in, the, tone, mood, or, stance, of, the, poem, later, the, abba, abba, pattern, became, the, standard, for, italian, sonnets, for, the, sestet, there, were, two, different, possibilities, cde, cde, and, cdc, cdc, in, time, other, variants, on, this, rhyming, scheme, were, introduced, such, as, cdc, dcd, or, cde, dce, petrarch, typically, used, an, abba, abba, pattern, for, the, octave, followed, by, either, cde, cde, or, cdc, cdc, rhymes, in, the, sestet, at, the, turn, of, the, 14th, century, there, arrive, early, examples, of, the, sonnet, sequence, unified, about, a, single, theme, this, is, represented, by, folgore, da, san, geminiano, s, series, on, the, months, of, the, year, followed, by, his, sequence, on, the, days, of, the, week, at, a, slightly, earlier, date, dante, had, published, his, la, vita, nuova, a, narrative, commentary, in, which, appear, sonnets, and, other, lyrical, forms, centred, on, the, poet, s, love, for, beatrice, most, of, the, sonnets, there, are, petrarchan, here, used, as, a, purely, stylistic, term, since, dante, predated, petrarch, chapter, vii, gives, the, sonnet, o, voi, che, per, la, via, with, two, sestets, aabaab, aabaab, and, two, quatrains, cddc, cddc, and, ch, viii, morte, villana, with, two, sestets, aabbba, aabbba, and, two, quatrains, cddc, cddc, petrarch, followed, in, his, footsteps, later, in, the, next, century, with, the, 366, sonnets, of, the, canzionere, which, chronicle, his, life, long, love, for, laura, widespread, as, sonnet, writing, became, in, italian, society, among, practitioners, were, to, be, found, some, better, known, for, other, things, the, painters, giotto, and, michelangelo, for, example, and, the, astronomer, galileo, the, academician, giovanni, mario, crescimbeni, lists, 661, poets, just, in, the, 16th, century, so, common, were, they, that, eventually, in, the, words, of, a, literary, historian, no, event, was, so, trivial, none, so, commonplace, a, tradesman, could, not, open, a, larger, shop, a, government, clerk, could, not, obtain, a, few, additional, scudi, of, salary, but, all, his, friends, and, acquaintance, must, celebrate, the, event, and, clothe, their, congratulations, in, a, copy, of, verses, which, almost, invariably, assumed, this, shape, the, sole, confirmed, surviving, sonnet, in, the, occitan, language, is, by, paolo, lanfranchi, da, pistoia, and, confidently, dated, to, 1284, this, employs, the, rhyme, scheme, abab, abab, cdcdcd, and, has, a, political, theme, as, do, some, others, of, dubious, authenticity, or, merit, ascribed, to, william, of, almarichi, and, dante, de, maiano, one, of, the, earliest, sonnets, in, catalan, was, written, by, pere, torroella, 1436, 1486, in, the, 16th, century, the, most, prolific, and, subtle, catalan, writer, of, sonnets, was, pere, seraf, author, of, over, 60, published, between, 1560, and, 1565, the, poet, igo, l, pez, de, mendoza, 1st, marquis, of, santillana, is, credited, as, among, the, foremost, to, attempt, sonnets, written, in, the, italian, manner, sonetos, fechos, al, it, lico, modo, towards, the, middle, of, the, 15th, century, since, the, castilian, language, and, prosody, were, in, a, transitional, state, at, the, time, the, experiment, was, unsuccessful, it, was, therefore, not, until, after, 1526, that, the, form, was, reintroduced, by, juan, bosc, n, according, to, his, account, he, met, andrea, navagero, the, venetian, ambassador, to, the, spanish, court, in, that, year, while, the, latter, was, accompanying, king, carlos, v, on, a, visit, to, the, alhambra, in, the, course, of, their, literary, discussion, navagero, then, suggested, that, the, poet, might, attempt, the, sonnet, and, other, italian, forms, in, his, own, language, bosc, n, not, only, took, up, the, venetian, s, advice, but, did, so, in, association, with, the, more, talented, garcilaso, de, la, vega, a, friend, to, whom, some, of, his, sonnets, are, addressed, and, whose, early, death, is, mourned, in, another, the, poems, of, both, followed, the, petrarchan, model, employed, the, hitherto, unfamiliar, hendecasyllable, and, when, writing, of, love, were, based, on, the, neoplatonic, ideal, championed, in, the, book, of, the, courtier, il, cortegiano, that, bosc, n, had, also, translated, their, reputation, was, consolidated, by, the, later, 1580, edition, of, fernando, de, herrera, who, was, himself, accounted, the, first, major, spanish, sonneteer, after, garcilaso, during, the, baroque, period, that, followed, two, notable, writers, of, sonnets, headed, rival, stylistic, schools, the, culteranismo, of, luis, de, g, ngora, later, known, as, gongorismo, after, him, was, distinguished, by, an, artificial, style, and, the, use, of, elaborate, vocabulary, complex, syntactical, order, and, involved, metaphors, the, verbal, usage, of, his, opponent, francisco, de, quevedo, was, equally, self, conscious, deploying, wordplay, and, metaphysical, conceits, after, which, the, style, was, known, as, conceptismo, another, key, figure, at, this, period, was, lope, de, vega, who, was, responsible, for, writing, some, 3, 000, sonnets, a, large, proportion, of, them, incorporated, into, his, dramas, one, of, the, best, known, and, most, imitated, was, un, soneto, me, manda, hacer, violante, violante, orders, me, to, write, a, sonnet, which, occupies, a, pivotal, position, in, literary, history, at, its, first, appearance, in, his, 1617, comedy, la, ni, a, de, plata, act, 3, the, character, there, pretends, to, be, a, novice, whose, text, is, a, running, commentary, on, the, poem, s, creation, although, the, poet, himself, is, portrayed, as, composing, it, as, a, light, hearted, impromptu, in, the, biographical, film, lope, 2010, there, had, in, fact, been, precedents, in, spanish, some, fifty, years, before, diego, hurtado, de, mendoza, had, written, the, pretended, impromptu, ped, s, reina, un, soneto, and, even, earlier, in, italian, there, had, been, the, similarly, themed, qualunque, vuol, saper, fare, un, sonetto, whoever, to, make, a, sonnet, aspires, by, the, florentine, poet, pieraccio, tedaldi, b, ca, 1285, 1290, d, ca, 1350, later, imitations, in, other, languages, include, one, in, italian, by, giambattista, marino, and, another, in, french, by, fran, ois, s, raphin, r, gnier, desmarais, as, well, as, an, adaptation, of, the, idea, applied, to, the, rondeau, by, vincent, voiture, the, poem, s, fascination, for, u, s, writers, is, evidenced, by, no, less, than, five, translations, in, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, alone, the, sonnet, form, crossed, the, atlantic, quite, early, in, the, spanish, colonial, enterprise, when, francisco, de, terrazas, the, son, of, a, 16th, century, conquistador, was, among, its, mexican, pioneers, later, came, two, sonnet, writers, in, holy, orders, bishop, miguel, de, guevara, 1585, 1646, and, especially, sister, juana, in, s, de, la, cruz, but, though, sonnets, continued, to, be, written, in, both, the, old, world, and, the, new, innovation, was, mainly, limited, to, the, americas, where, the, sonnet, was, used, to, express, a, different, and, post, colonial, reality, in, the, 19th, century, for, example, there, were, two, poets, who, wrote, memorable, sonnets, dedicated, to, mexican, landscapes, joaqu, n, acadio, pagaza, y, ord, ez, in, the, torrid, zone, to, the, south, and, manuel, jos, oth, n, in, the, desolate, north, in, south, america, too, the, sonnet, was, used, to, invoke, landscape, particularly, in, the, major, collections, of, the, uruguayan, julio, herrera, y, reissig, such, as, los, parques, abandonados, deserted, parks, 1902, 08, and, los, xtasis, de, la, monta, a, mountain, ecstasies, 1904, 07, whose, recognisably, authentic, pastoral, scenes, went, on, to, serve, as, example, for, c, sar, vallejo, in, his, evocations, of, andean, peru, soon, afterwards, the, sonnet, form, was, deconstructed, as, part, of, the, modernist, questioning, of, the, past, thus, in, the, argentine, poet, alfonsina, storni, s, mascarilla, y, tr, bol, mask, and, clover, 1938, a, section, of, unrhymed, poems, using, many, of, the, traditional, versification, structures, of, the, form, are, presented, under, the, title, antisonnets, dom, pedro, a, son, of, king, john, i, has, been, credited, with, translations, of, sonnets, by, petrarch, into, portuguese, but, the, form, did, not, come, into, its, own, until, the, start, of, the, 16th, century, it, was, then, that, s, de, miranda, introduced, the, sonnet, and, other, italian, forms, after, returning, from, a, five, year, stay, in, italy, however, the, greatest, sonneteer, of, this, period, was, the, slightly, younger, lu, s, de, cam, es, though, in, his, work, the, influence, of, the, spanish, pioneers, of, the, form, has, also, been, discerned, among, later, writers, the, comic, sonnets, of, thomas, de, noronha, were, once, appreciated, and, the, love, sonnets, of, barbosa, bacellar, c, 1610, 1663, also, known, for, his, learned, glosses, on, the, sonnets, of, cam, es, the, introduction, later, of, a, purified, sonnet, style, to, brazilian, literature, was, due, to, cl, udio, manuel, da, costa, who, also, composed, petrarchan, sonnets, in, italian, during, his, stay, in, europe, however, it, was, in, the, wake, of, french, parnassianism, that, there, developed, a, similar, movement, in, brazil, which, included, the, notable, sonneteers, alberto, de, oliveira, raimundo, correia, and, especially, olavo, bilac, others, writing, sonnets, in, that, style, included, the, now, overlooked, francisca, j, lia, da, silva, munster, 1871, 1920, and, the, symbolist, afro, brazilian, poet, jo, o, da, cruz, e, sousa, in, french, prosody, sonnets, are, traditionally, composed, in, the, french, alexandrine, which, consists, of, lines, of, twelve, syllables, with, a, central, caesura, imitations, of, petrarch, were, first, introduced, by, cl, ment, marot, and, mellin, de, saint, gelais, also, took, up, the, form, near, the, start, of, the, 16th, century, they, were, later, followed, by, pierre, de, ronsard, joachim, du, bellay, and, jean, antoine, de, ba, f, around, whom, formed, a, group, of, radical, young, noble, poets, of, the, court, generally, known, today, as, la, pl, iade, they, employed, amongst, other, forms, of, poetry, the, petrarchan, sonnet, cycle, developed, around, an, amorous, encounter, or, an, idealized, woman, the, character, of, the, group, s, literary, program, was, given, in, du, bellay, s, manifesto, the, defense, and, illustration, of, the, french, language, 1549, which, maintained, that, french, like, the, tuscan, of, petrarch, and, dante, was, a, worthy, language, for, literary, expression, and, which, promulgated, a, program, of, linguistic, and, literary, production, and, purification, in, the, aftermath, of, the, wars, of, religion, french, catholic, jurist, and, poet, jean, de, la, cepp, de, published, the, theorems, a, sequence, of, 515, sonnets, with, non, traditional, rhyme, schemes, about, the, passion, and, resurrection, of, jesus, christ, drawing, upon, the, gospels, greek, and, roman, mythology, and, the, fathers, of, the, church, la, cepp, de, s, poetry, was, praised, by, saint, francis, de, sales, for, transforming, the, pagan, muses, into, christian, ones, la, cepp, de, s, sonnets, often, attack, the, calvinist, doctrine, of, a, judgmental, and, unforgiving, god, by, focusing, on, christ, s, passionate, love, for, the, human, race, afterwards, the, work, was, long, forgotten, until, the, 20th, century, witnessed, a, revival, of, interest, in, the, poet, and, his, sonnets, are, now, regarded, as, classic, works, of, french, poetry, by, the, late, 17th, century, the, sonnet, had, fallen, out, of, fashion, but, was, revived, by, the, romantics, in, the, 19th, century, charles, augustin, sainte, beuve, then, published, his, imitation, of, william, wordsworth, s, scorn, not, the, sonnet, where, in, addition, to, the, poets, enumerated, in, the, english, original, shakespeare, petrarch, tasso, camoens, dante, spenser, milton, sainte, beuve, announces, his, own, intention, to, revive, the, form, and, adds, the, names, of, du, bellay, and, ronsard, in, the, final, tercet, the, form, was, little, used, however, until, the, parnassians, brought, it, back, into, favour, and, following, them, the, symbolist, poets, overseas, in, canada, the, teenaged, mile, nelligan, is, particularly, noted, among, the, french, language, poets, who, wrote, sonnets, in, that, style, during, the, latter, half, of, the, 19th, century, there, were, many, deviations, from, the, traditional, sonnet, form, charles, baudelaire, was, responsible, for, significant, variations, in, rhyme, scheme, and, line, length, in, the, poems, included, in, les, fleurs, du, mal, among, the, variations, made, by, others, th, odore, de, banville, s, sur, une, dame, blonde, limited, itself, to, a, four, syllable, line, while, in, une, jeune, morte, jules, de, ress, guier, 1788, 1862, composed, a, sonnet, monosyllabically, lined, sir, thomas, wyatt, and, henry, howard, earl, of, surrey, have, been, described, as, the, first, english, petrarchans, from, their, pioneering, the, sonnet, form, in, english, in, addition, some, 25, of, wyatt, s, poems, are, dependent, on, petrarch, either, as, translations, or, imitations, while, of, surrey, s, five, three, of, them, are, translations, and, two, imitations, in, one, instance, both, poets, translated, the, same, poem, rime, 140, from, these, examples, as, elsewhere, in, their, prosodic, practice, a, difference, between, their, style, can, be, observed, wyatt, s, verse, metre, though, in, general, decasyllabic, is, irregular, and, proceeds, by, way, of, significantly, stressed, phrasal, units, but, in, addition, wyatt, s, sonnets, are, generally, closer, in, construction, to, those, of, petrarch, prosodically, surrey, is, more, adept, at, composing, in, iambic, pentameter, and, his, sonnets, are, written, in, what, has, come, to, be, known, anachronistically, as, shakespearean, measure, this, version, of, the, sonnet, form, characterised, by, three, alternately, rhymed, quatrains, terminating, in, a, final, couplet, abab, cdcd, efef, gg, became, the, favourite, during, elizabethan, times, when, it, was, widely, used, it, was, particularly, so, in, whole, series, of, amatory, sequences, beginning, with, sir, philip, sidney, s, astrophel, and, stella, 1591, and, continuing, over, a, period, of, two, decades, about, four, thousand, sonnets, were, composed, during, this, time, however, with, such, a, volume, much, there, that, was, conventional, and, repetitious, came, to, be, viewed, with, a, sceptical, eye, sir, john, davies, mocked, these, in, a, series, of, nine, gulling, sonnets, and, william, shakespeare, was, also, to, dismiss, some, of, them, in, his, sonnet, 130, my, mistress, eyes, are, nothing, like, the, sun, shakespeare, s, sequence, of, 154, sonnets, departs, from, the, norm, in, addressing, more, than, one, person, in, its, course, male, as, well, as, female, in, addition, other, sonnets, by, him, were, incorporated, into, some, of, his, plays, another, exception, at, this, time, was, the, form, used, in, edmund, spenser, s, amoretti, which, has, the, interlaced, rhyme, scheme, abab, bcbc, cdcd, ee, and, soon, after, in, the, following, century, john, donne, adapted, the, emerging, baroque, style, to, the, new, subject, matter, of, his, series, of, holy, sonnets, john, milton, s, sonnets, constitute, a, special, case, and, demonstrate, another, stylistic, transition, two, youthful, examples, in, english, and, five, in, italian, are, petrarchan, in, spirit, but, the, seventeen, sonnets, of, his, maturity, address, personal, and, political, themes, it, has, been, observed, of, their, intimate, tone, and, the, way, the, sense, overrides, the, volta, within, the, poem, in, some, cases, that, milton, is, here, adapting, the, sonnet, form, to, that, of, the, horatian, ode, he, also, seems, to, have, been, the, first, to, introduce, an, italian, variation, of, the, form, the, caudate, sonnet, into, english, in, his, prolongation, of, on, the, new, forcers, of, conscience, under, the, long, parliament, the, fashion, for, the, sonnet, went, out, with, the, restoration, and, hardly, any, were, written, between, 1670, and, the, second, half, of, the, 18th, century, amongst, the, first, to, revive, the, form, was, thomas, warton, who, took, milton, for, his, model, around, him, at, oxford, were, grouped, those, associated, with, him, in, this, revival, including, john, codrington, bampfylde, thomas, russell, thomas, warwick, and, henry, headley, some, of, whom, published, small, collections, of, sonnets, alone, many, women, too, now, took, up, the, sonnet, form, in, particular, charlotte, smith, whose, lachrymose, elegiac, sonnets, 1784, onwards, are, credited, with, helping, create, the, school, of, sensibility, characteristic, of, the, time, william, lisle, bowles, was, also, a, close, follower, but, the, success, of, both, stirred, up, resistance, in, the, poetic, politics, of, the, time, william, beckford, parodied, smith, s, melancholy, manner, and, archaic, diction, in, an, elegiac, sonnet, to, a, mopstick, in, the, preface, to, his, 1796, collection, poems, on, various, subjects, samuel, taylor, coleridge, commented, of, his, series, of, effusions, that, i, was, fearful, that, the, title, sonnet, might, have, reminded, my, reader, of, the, poems, of, the, rev, w, l, bowles, a, comparison, with, whom, would, have, sunk, me, below, that, mediocrity, on, the, surface, of, which, i, am, at, present, enabled, to, float, there, were, formal, objections, too, where, most, of, the, early, revivalists, had, used, milton, s, sonnets, as, the, model, for, theirs, smith, and, bowles, had, preferred, the, shakespearean, form, this, led, to, mary, robinson, s, fighting, preface, to, her, sequence, sappho, and, phaon, in, which, she, asserted, the, legitimacy, of, the, petrarchan, form, as, used, by, milton, over, the, non, descript, ephemera, from, the, heated, brains, of, self, important, poetasters, that, pass, as, sonnets, in, the, literary, reviews, of, her, day, the, example, which, later, impressed, wordsworth, the, most, was, that, of, milton, s, sonnets, which, he, described, in, 1803, as, having, an, energetic, and, varied, flow, of, sound, crowding, into, narrow, room, more, of, the, combined, effect, of, rhyme, and, blank, verse, than, can, be, done, by, any, other, kind, of, verse, i, know, of, thus, aware, that, its, compression, was, applicable, to, a, great, variety, of, themes, wordsworth, eventually, wrote, some, 523, sonnets, which, were, to, exert, a, powerful, stylistic, influence, throughout, the, first, half, of, the, 19th, century, part, of, his, appeal, to, others, was, the, way, in, which, he, used, the, sonnet, as, a, focus, for, new, subject, matter, frequently, in, sequences, from, his, series, on, the, river, duddon, sprang, reflections, on, any, number, of, regional, natural, features, his, travel, tour, effusions, though, not, always, confined, to, sonnet, form, found, many, imitators, what, eventually, became, three, series, of, ecclesiastical, sonnets, started, a, vogue, for, sonnets, on, religious, and, devotional, themes, milton, s, predilection, for, political, themes, continuing, through, wordsworth, s, sonnets, dedicated, to, liberty, and, order, now, became, an, example, for, contemporaries, too, barely, had, the, process, begun, however, before, a, sceptical, alarmist, in, the, new, monthly, magazine, for, 1821, was, diagnosing, sonnettomania, as, a, new, sickness, akin, to, the, bite, of, a, rabid, animal, another, arm, of, the, propaganda, on, behalf, of, the, sonnet, in, romantic, times, was, the, reflexive, strategy, of, recommending, it, in, sonnet, form, as, a, demonstration, of, its, possibility, of, variation, in, wordsworth, s, nuns, fret, not, at, their, narrow, room, 1807, the, volta, comes, after, the, seventh, line, dividing, the, poem, into, two, equal, parts, keats, makes, use, of, frequent, enjambment, in, if, by, dull, rhymes, our, english, must, be, chained, 1816, and, divides, its, sense, units, into, four, tercets, and, a, couplet, what, keats, is, recommending, there, is, the, more, intricate, rhyming, system, a, b, c, a, b, d, c, a, b, c, d, e, d, e, that, he, demonstrates, in, its, course, as, a, means, of, giving, the, form, greater, breathing, room, wordsworth, later, accomplishes, this, in, scorn, not, the, sonnet, 1827, which, is, without, midway, division, and, where, enjambment, is, so, managed, that, the, sense, overrides, from, line, to, line, in, an, ode, like, movement, with, the, similar, aim, of, freeing, the, form, from, its, fetters, matthew, arnold, turns, his, austerity, of, poetry, 1867, into, a, narrative, carried, forward, over, an, enjambed, eighth, line, to, a, conclusion, that, is, limited, to, the, final, three, lines, by, the, time, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, was, reached, sonnets, become, chiefly, interesting, for, their, publication, in, long, sequences, it, was, during, this, period, that, attempts, to, renew, the, form, were, continually, being, made, elizabeth, barrett, browning, s, autobiographical, sonnets, from, the, portuguese, 1845, 50, for, example, is, described, as, the, first, depiction, of, a, successful, courtship, since, elizabethan, times, it, comprises, 44, sonnets, of, dramatised, first, person, narrative, the, enjambed, lines, in, which, frequently, avoid, resting, at, the, volta, through, this, means, the, work, is, distinguished, by, the, flexibility, and, control, with, which, the, verse, bends, to, the, argument, and, to, the, rhythms, of, thought, and, speech, that, sequence, was, followed, in, 1862, by, george, meredith, s, modern, love, based, in, part, on, the, breakdown, of, his, first, marriage, it, employs, a, 16, line, form, described, as, and, working, like, a, sonnet, linking, together, the, work, s, fifty, narrative, episodes, essentially, the, stanza, is, made, up, of, four, quatrains, of, enclosed, rhyme, rhythmically, driven, forward, over, these, divisions, so, as, to, allow, a, greater, syntactical, complexity, more, readily, associated, with, the, realist, novel, than, with, lyric, poetry, as, other, work, by, both, the, writers, above, demonstrates, they, were, capable, of, more, straightforward, fictions, in, adapting, the, sonnet, to, the, narrative, mode, the, main, interest, for, them, is, in, overcoming, the, technical, challenge, that, they, set, themselves, and, proving, the, new, possibilities, of, the, form, in, which, they, are, working, where, the, first, quatrain, in, sonnets, from, the, portuguese, began, with, a, reminiscence, of, lines, from, a, pastoral, of, theocritus, edward, cracroft, lefroy, 1855, 1891, responded, by, reaching, beyond, the, narrative, mode, towards, the, dramatic, in, the, thirty, adaptations, from, the, greek, of, his, echoes, from, theocritus, 1885, reprint, 1922, beyond, this, though, the, idea, of, arranging, such, material, in, a, sequence, was, original, to, lefroy, thomas, warwick, had, anticipated, the, approach, a, century, before, in, his, sonnet, from, bacchylides, equally, based, on, a, fragment, of, an, ancient, greek, author, on, the, other, hand, eugene, lee, hamilton, s, exploration, of, the, sonnet, s, dramatic, possibilities, was, through, creating, historical, monologues, in, his, hundred, imaginary, sonnets, 1888, based, on, episodes, chosen, from, the, seven, centuries, between, 1120, 1820, neither, sequence, was, anywhere, the, equal, of, those, of, barrett, browning, or, meredith, but, they, illustrate, a, contemporary, urge, to, make, new, a, form, that, was, fast, running, out, of, steam, as, part, of, his, attempted, renewal, of, poetic, prosody, gerard, manley, hopkins, had, applied, his, experimental, sprung, rhythm, to, the, composition, of, the, sonnet, amplifying, the, number, of, unstressed, syllables, within, a, five, or, occasionally, six, stressed, line, as, in, the, rhetorical, the, windhover, for, example, he, also, introduced, variations, in, the, proportions, of, the, sonnet, from, the, 10, 1, 2, lines, of, the, curtal, sonnet, pied, beauty, to, the, amplified, 24, line, caudate, sonnet, that, nature, is, a, heraclitean, fire, though, they, were, written, in, the, later, victorian, era, the, poems, remained, virtually, unknown, until, they, were, published, in, 1918, the, undergraduate, w, h, auden, is, sometimes, credited, with, dispensing, with, rhyme, altogether, in, the, secret, agent, but, went, on, to, write, many, conventional, sonnets, including, two, long, sequences, during, the, time, of, international, crisis, in, time, of, war, 1939, and, the, quest, 1940, sequences, by, some, others, have, been, more, experimental, and, looser, in, form, of, which, a, radical, example, was, altarwise, by, owl, light, 1935, ten, irregular, and, barely, rhyming, quatorzains, by, dylan, thomas, in, his, most, opaque, manner, in, 1978, two, later, innovatory, sequences, were, published, at, a, period, when, it, was, considered, that, the, sonnet, seems, to, want, to, lie, fallow, exhausted, in, the, words, of, one, commentator, peter, dale, s, book, length, one, another, contains, a, dialogue, of, some, sixty, sonnets, in, which, the, variety, of, rhyming, methods, are, as, diverse, as, the, emotions, expressed, between, the, speakers, there, at, the, same, time, geoffrey, hill, s, an, apology, for, the, revival, of, christian, architecture, in, england, appeared, in, tenebrae, 1978, where, the, challenging, thirteen, poems, of, the, sequence, employ, half, rhyme, and, generally, ignore, the, volta, seamus, heaney, also, wrote, two, sequences, during, this, period, the, personal, glanmore, sonnets, in, field, work, 1975, and, the, more, freely, constructed, elegiac, sonnets, of, clearances, in, the, haw, lantern, 1987, the, earliest, american, sonnet, is, david, humphreys, s, 1776, sonnet, addressed, to, my, friends, at, yale, college, on, my, leaving, them, to, join, the, army, the, sonnet, form, was, used, widely, thereafter, including, by, william, lloyd, garrison, and, william, cullen, bryant, later, henry, wadsworth, longfellow, and, others, followed, suit, his, were, characterised, by, a, purple, richness, of, diction, and, by, their, use, of, material, images, to, illustrate, niceties, of, thought, and, emotion, he, also, translated, several, sonnets, including, seven, by, michelangelo, later, on, among, emma, lazarus, many, sonnets, perhaps, the, best, known, is, the, new, colossus, of, 1883, which, celebrates, the, statue, of, liberty, and, its, role, in, welcoming, immigrants, to, the, new, world, in, the, 19th, century, sonnets, written, by, american, poets, began, to, be, anthologised, as, such, they, were, included, in, a, separate, section, in, leigh, hunt, and, s, adams, the, book, of, the, sonnet, london, and, boston, 1867, which, included, an, essay, by, adams, on, american, sonnets, and, sonneteers, and, a, section, devoted, only, to, sonnets, by, american, women, later, came, william, sharp, s, anthology, of, american, sonnets, 1889, and, charles, h, crandall, s, representative, sonnets, by, american, poets, with, an, essay, on, the, sonnet, its, nature, and, history, houghton, mifflin, co, 1890, the, essay, also, surveyed, the, whole, history, of, the, sonnet, including, english, examples, and, european, examples, in, translation, in, order, to, contextualise, the, american, achievement, recent, scholarship, has, recovered, many, african, american, sonnets, that, were, not, anthologised, in, standard, american, poetry, volumes, important, nineteenth, and, early, twentieth, century, writers, have, included, paul, laurence, dunbar, claude, mckay, countee, cullen, langston, hughes, and, sterling, a, brown, several, african, american, women, poets, won, prizes, for, volumes, that, included, sonnets, such, as, margaret, walker, yale, poetry, series, gwendolyn, brooks, pulitzer, prize, rita, dove, pulitzer, prize, and, natasha, trethewey, pulitzer, prize, though, langston, hughes, and, amiri, baraka, were, to, question, the, appropriateness, of, the, sonnet, for, black, poetry, both, had, published, sonnets, themselves, one, aspect, of, the, american, sonnet, during, the, 20th, century, was, the, publication, of, sequences, which, had, to, wait, decades, for, critical, recognition, one, instance, is, this, man, s, army, a, war, in, fifty, odd, sonnets, 1928, by, john, allan, wyeth, a, series, of, irregular, sonnets, that, recorded, impressions, of, his, military, service, with, the, american, expeditionary, force, during, the, first, world, war, it, was, scarcely, noticed, when, it, first, appeared, yet, on, its, republication, in, 2008, dana, gioia, asserted, in, his, introduction, that, wyeth, is, the, only, american, poet, of, the, great, war, who, can, stand, comparison, to, british, war, poets, a, claim, later, corroborated, by, jon, stallworthy, in, his, review, of, the, work, shortly, after, the, publication, of, wyeth, s, h, p, lovecraft, wrote, his, very, different, sonnet, sequence, sections, of, which, first, appeared, in, genre, magazines, it, was, not, until, 1943, that, it, saw, complete, publication, as, fungi, from, yuggoth, these, 36, poems, were, written, in, a, hybrid, form, based, on, the, petrarchan, sonnet, that, invariably, ends, with, a, rhyming, couplet, reminiscent, of, the, shakespearean, sonnet, most, of, these, poems, are, discontinuous, though, unified, by, theme, being, vignettes, descriptive, of, the, kinds, of, dreamed, and, otherworldly, scenarios, found, in, lovecraft, s, fiction, their, unmannered, style, was, once, compared, to, edward, arlington, robinson, s, but, since, then, a, case, has, been, made, for, the, work, as, minor, poetry, of, contemporary, importance, in, its, own, right, in, the, case, of, john, berryman, he, initially, wrote, a, series, of, some, hundred, modernistic, love, sonnets, during, the, 1940s, these, however, remained, uncollected, until, 1967, when, they, appeared, as, berryman, s, sonnets, fleshed, out, with, a, few, additions, to, give, them, the, form, of, a, sequence, in, her, 2014, survey, of, the, book, for, poetry, april, bernard, suggests, that, he, was, there, making, of, berryman, a, similar, semi, fictional, character, to, the, henry, in, the, dream, songs, 1964, she, also, identifies, an, ancient, ancestry, for, the, disordered, syntax, of, the, work, through, the, english, poets, thomas, wyatt, and, gerard, manley, hopkins, but, at, this, time, too, began, to, appear, sequences, of, quatorzains, with, only, a, tenuous, relationship, to, the, sonnet, form, ted, berrigan, s, the, sonnets, 1964, discard, metre, and, rhyme, but, retain, the, dynamics, of, a, 14, line, structure, with, a, change, of, direction, at, the, volta, berrigan, claimed, to, have, been, inspired, by, shakespeare, s, sonnets, because, they, were, quick, musical, witty, and, short, others, have, described, berrigan, s, work, as, a, postmodern, collage, using, repetition, rearrangement, and, the, use, of, found, phrases, and, text, that, functions, as, a, radical, deconstruction, of, the, sonnet, from, 1969, robert, lowell, too, began, publishing, a, less, radical, deconstruction, of, the, form, in, his, series, of, five, collections, of, blank, verse, sonnets, including, his, pulitzer, prize, volume, the, dolphin, 1973, these, he, described, as, having, the, eloquence, at, best, of, iambic, pentameter, and, often, the, structure, and, climaxes, of, sonnets, the, contemporary, reaction, against, the, strict, form, is, described, in, the, introduction, to, william, baer, s, anthology, sonnets, 150, contemporary, sonnets, 2005, but, for, all, that, a, number, of, writers, were, declaring, then, that, the, sonnet, was, dead, others, including, richard, wilbur, howard, nemerov, and, anthony, hecht, continued, to, write, sonnets, and, eventually, became, associated, with, the, magazines, the, formalist, and, then, measure, these, journals, champions, of, the, new, formalism, between, the, years, 1994, and, 2017, sponsored, the, annual, howard, nemerov, sonnet, award, in, canada, during, the, last, decades, of, the, 19th, century, the, confederation, poets, and, especially, archibald, lampman, were, known, for, their, sonnets, which, were, mainly, on, pastoral, themes, canadian, poet, seymour, mayne, has, published, a, few, collections, of, word, sonnets, and, is, one, of, the, chief, innovators, of, a, form, using, a, single, word, per, line, to, capture, its, honed, perception, paulus, melissus, was, the, first, to, introduce, the, sonnet, into, german, poetry, but, the, man, who, did, most, to, raise, the, sonnet, to, german, consciousness, was, martin, opitz, who, in, two, works, buch, von, der, deutschen, poeterey, 1624, and, acht, b, cher, deutscher, poematum, 1625, established, the, sonnet, as, a, separate, genre, and, its, rules, of, composition, it, was, to, be, written, in, iambic, alexandrines, with, alternating, masculine, and, feminine, enclosed, rhymes, in, the, octave, and, a, more, flexible, sestet, with, three, rhymes, reinforcing, them, were, translated, examples, from, petrarch, ronsard, and, daniel, heinsius, thereafter, in, the, 18th, century, johann, wolfgang, von, goethe, wrote, several, love, sonnets, using, a, rhyme, scheme, derived, from, italian, poetry, after, his, death, goethe, s, followers, created, the, freer, german, sonnet, which, is, rhymed, abba, bccb, cdd, cdd, the, sonnet, tradition, was, then, continued, by, august, wilhelm, von, schlegel, paul, von, heyse, and, others, reaching, fruition, in, rainer, maria, rilke, s, sonnets, to, orpheus, which, has, been, described, as, one, of, the, great, modern, poems, not, to, mention, a, monumental, addition, to, the, literature, of, the, sonnet, sequence, a, cycle, of, 55, sonnets, it, was, written, in, two, parts, in, 1922, while, rilke, was, in, the, midst, of, completing, his, duino, elegies, the, full, title, in, german, is, die, sonette, an, orpheus, geschrieben, als, ein, grab, mal, f, r, wera, ouckama, knoop, translated, as, sonnets, to, orpheus, written, as, a, monument, for, wera, ouckama, knoop, commemorating, the, recent, death, of, a, young, dancer, from, leukaemia, the, grab, mal, literally, grave, marker, of, the, title, brings, to, mind, the, series, of, tombeaux, written, by, st, phane, mallarm, translated, among, others, by, rilke, in, 1919, also, coinciding, with, the, sonnets, of, michelangelo, which, rilke, had, been, translating, in, 1921, rilke, s, own, sonnets, are, fluidly, structured, as, a, transposition, of, the, dead, girl, s, dancing, and, encompass, themes, of, life, and, death, and, art, s, relation, to, them, as, well, as, having, varied, rhyme, schemes, line, lengths, also, vary, and, are, irregularly, metred, even, within, the, same, sonnet, at, times, responses, to, turbulent, times, form, a, distinct, category, among, german, sonnets, they, include,

revolutions, of, 1848, 1849, and, the, first, schleswig, war, in, the, wake, of, the, first, world, war, anton, schnack, described, by, one, anthologist, as, the, only, german, language, poet, whose, work, can, be, compared, with, that, of, wilfred, owen, published, the, sonnet, sequence, tier, rang, gewaltig, mit, tier, beast, strove, mightily, with, beast, 1920, the, 60, poems, there, have, the, typical, german, sonnet, form, but, are, written, in, the, long, lined, free, rhythms, developed, by, ernst, stadler, patrick, bridgwater, writing, in, 1985, called, the, work, without, question, the, best, single, collection, produced, by, a, german, war, poet, in, 1914, 18, but, adds, that, it, is, to, this, day, virtually, unknown, even, in, germany, in, the, netherlands, pieter, corneliszoon,

another, of, his, sonnets, dedicated, to, hugo, grotius, was, later, translated, by, edmund, gosse, in, later, centuries, the, sonnet, form, was, dropped, and, then, returned, to, by, successive, waves, of, innovators, in, an, attempt, to, breathe, new, life, into, dutch, poetry, when, in, their, eyes, it, had, lost, its, way, for, the, generation, of, the, 1880s, it, was, jacques, perk, s, sonnet, sequence, mathilde, which, served, as, a, rallying, cry, and, for, a, while, in, the, early, years, of, the, new, century, martinus, nijhoff, wrote, notable, sonnets, before, turning, to, more, modernistic, models, following, the, second, world, war, avant, garde, poets, declared, war, on, all, formalism, reacting, particularly, against, the, extreme, subjectivity, and, self, aggrandisement, of, representatives, of, the, 1880s, style, like, willem, kloos, who, had, once, begun, a, sonnet, in, my, deepest, being, i, m, a, god, in, reaction, lucebert, satirised, such, writing, in, the, sonnet, with, which, his, first, collection, opened, i, me, i, me, me, i, me, i, i, i, my, my, my, i, but, by, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, formalist, poets, such, as, gerrit, komrij, and, jan, kal, were, writing, sonnets, again, as, part, of, their, own, reaction, to, the, experimentalism, of, earlier, decades, the, sonnet, was, introduced, into, czech, literature, at, the, beginning, of, the, 19th, century, the, first, great, czech, sonneteer, was, j, n, koll, r, who, wrote, a, cycle, of, sonnets, named, sl, vy, dcera, the, daughter, of, sl, va, the, daughter, of,

began, to, experiment, with, sonnets, but, the, form, was, soon, overtaken, in, popularity, by, the, more, flexible, onegin, stanza, this, was, used, by, alexander, pushkin, for, his, novel, in, verse, eugene, onegin, and, has, also, been, described, as, the, onegin, sonnet, since, it, consists, of, fourteen, lines, it, is, however, aberrant, in, rhyme, scheme, and, the, number, of, stresses, per, line, and, is, better, described, as, having, only, a, family, resemblance, to, the, sonnet, the, form, was, adapted, by, other, poets, later, including, by, mikhail, lermontov, in, his, narrative, of, the, tambov, treasurer, s, wife, in, slovenia, the, sonnet, became, a, national, verse, form, using, iambic, pentameter, with, feminine, rhymes, based, both, on, the, italian,

poets, of, irish, heritage, such, as, sir, aubrey, de, vere, oscar, wilde, william, butler, yeats, tom, kettle, and, patrick, kavanagh, the, sonnet, form, failed, to, enter, irish, poetry, in, the, irish, language, this, changed, however, during, the, gaelic, revival, when, dublin, born, liam, g, gan, 1891, 1979, was, dismissed, from, his, post, in, the, national, museum, of, ireland, and,

long, been, considered, entirely, unsuitable, for, composing, poetry, in, irish, in, his, translations, soin, id, chose, to, closely, reproduce, shakespeare, s, rhyme, scheme, and, rhythms, while, rendering, into, irish, according, to, jan, morris, when, welsh, poets, speak, of, free, verse, they, mean, forms, like, the, sonnet, or, the, ode, which, obey, the, same, rules, as, english, poesy, strict, metres, verse, still, honours, the, complex, rules, laid, down, for, correct, poetic, composition, 600, years, ago, nevertheless, several, of, the, greatest, recent, welsh, language, poets,
