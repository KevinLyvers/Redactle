of, the, edo, period, by, a, large, influx, of, korean, potters, captured, or, persuaded, to, emigrate, in, the, course, of, the, japanese, invasions, of, korea, in, the, 1590s, many, of, these, were, settled, on, the, southern, island, of, kyushu, and, they, brought, with, them, experience, of, versions, of, the, chinese, style, chambered, climbing, kiln, called, noborigama, in, japan, which,

early, wares, called, early, imari, were, relatively, small, and, imitated, the, chinese, underglaze, blue, and, white, porcelain, which, japan, had, been, importing, for, some, time, the, porcelain, industry, greatly, expanded, in, the, late, 1650s, as, the, collapse, of, the, chinese, industry, from, civil, war, led, to, very, large, orders, from, the, chinese, traders, and, the, dutch, east, india, company, by, then, the, traders, only, permitted, to, do, business, in, japan, the, first, great, period, of, japanese, export, porcelain, lasted, until, about, the, 1740s, and, the, great,

period, when, the, emperor, of, japan, regained, ruling, power, in, 1868, japan, was, once, again, invaded, by, new, and, alien, forms, of, culture, during, the, prewar, period, the, introduction, of, western, cultural, values, led, to, a, dichotomy, in, japanese, art, as, well, as, in, nearly, every, other, aspect, of, culture, between, traditional, values, and, attempts, to, duplicate, and, assimilate, a, variety, of, clashing, new, ideas, this, split, remained, evident, in, the, late, 20th, century, although, much, synthesis, had, by, then, already, occurred, and, created, an, international, cultural, atmosphere, and, stimulated, contemporary, japanese, arts, toward, ever, more, innovative, forms, the, government, took, an, active, interest, in, the, art, export, market,

japan, itself, in, europe, and, america, the, new, availability, of, japanese, art, led, to, a, fascination, for, japanese, culture, a, craze, known, in, europe, as, japonisme, imperial, patronage, government, sponsorship, promotion, to, new, audiences, and, western, technology, combined, to, foster, an, era, of, japanese, artistic, innovation, in, the, decorative, arts, japanese, artists, reached, new, levels, of, technical, sophistication, today, masayuki, murata, owns, more, than, 10, 000, meiji, art, works, and, is, one, of, the, most, enthusiastic, collectors, from, that, time, most, of, the, excellent, works, of, meiji, art, were, bought, by, foreign, collectors, and, only, a, few, of, them, remained, in, japan, but, because, he, bought, back, many, works, from, foreign, countries, and, opened, the, kiyomizu, sannenzaka, museum, the, study, and, reevaluation, of, meiji, art, rapidly, advanced, in, japan, from, the, 21st, century, nasser, khalili, is, also, one, of, the, world, s, most, dedicated, collectors, of, meiji, art, and, his, collection, encompasses, many, categories, of, meiji, art, the, japanese, imperial, family, also, owns, excellent, works, of, meiji, art, some, of, which, were, donated, to, the, state, and, are, now, stored, in, the, museum, of, the, imperial, collections, by, the, early, 20th, century, european, art, forms, were, well,

first, response, of, the, japanese, to, western, art, forms, was, open, hearted, acceptance, and, in, 1876, the, technological, art, school, ja, was, opened, employing, italian, instructors, to, teach, western, methods, the, second, response, was, a, pendulum, swing, in, the, opposite, direction, spearheaded, by, okakura, kakuz, and, the, american, ernest, fenollosa, who, encouraged, japanese, artists, to, retain, traditional, themes, and, techniques, while, creating, works, more, in, keeping, with, contemporary, taste, this, was, a, strategy, that, eventually, served, to, extend, the, influence, of, japanese, art, as, far, as, calcutta, london, and, boston, in, the, years, leading, up, to, world, war, i, out, of, these, two, poles, of, artistic, theory, derived, from, europe,

japanese, enamels, artists, experimented, with, pastes, and, with, the, firing, process, to, produce, ever, larger, blocks, of, enamel, with, less, need, for, cloisons, enclosing, metal, strips, thus, enamels, became, a, more, pictorial, medium, with, designs, similar, to, or, copied, from, traditional, paintings, enamels, with, a, design, unique, to, japan, in, which, flowers, birds, and, insects, were, used, as, themes, became, popular, in, particular, the, works, of, namikawa, yasuyuki, and, namikawa, s, suke, were, exhibited, at, world, s, fairs, and, won, many, awards, along, with, the,

gold, or, silver, dust, was, the, most, common, technique, for, quality, lacquerware, in, this, period, shibata, zeshin, was, a, lacquerer, who, gained, a, high, reputation, for, his, works, from, the, bakumatsu, to, the, meiji, period, lacquerware, called, shibayama, and, somada, created, in, the, edo, period, became, popular, for, its, showy, style, inlaid, with, gold, silver, shellfish, ivory, and, colorful, metal, and, glass, and, reached, its, peak, during, this, period, lacquer, from, japanese, workshops, was, recognised, as, technically, superior, to, what, could, be, produced, anywhere, else, in, the, world, at, the, start, of, the, meiji, era, japanese, metalwork, was, almost, totally, unknown, outside, the, country, unlike, lacquer, and, porcelain, which, had, previously, been, exported, metalwork, was, connected, to, buddhist, practice, for, example, in, the, use, of, bronze, for, temple, bells, and, incense, cauldrons, so, there, were, fewer, opportunities, for, metalworkers, once, buddhism, was, displaced, as, the, state, religion, international, exhibitions, brought, japanese, cast, bronze, to, a, new, foreign, audience, attracting, strong, praise, the,

different, proportions, they, created, specialised, alloys, including, shakud, and, shibuichi, with, this, variety, of, alloys, and, finishes, an, artist, could, give, the, impression, of, full, colour, decoration, in, the, meiji, period, japanese, clothes, began, to, be, westernized, and, the, number, of, people, who, wore, kimono, decreased, so, the, craftsmen, who, made, netsuke, and, kiseru, with, ivory, and, wood, lost, their, demand, therefore, they, tried, to, create, a, new, field, ivory, sculptures, for, interior, decoration, and, many, elaborate, works, were, exported, to, foreign, countries, or, purchased, by, the, imperial, family, in, particular, the, works, of, ishikawa, komei, and, asahi, gyokuzan, won, praise, in, japan, technical, and, artistic, innovations, of,

province, elaborately, decorated, with, gilt, and, enamel, these, wares, were, highly, praised, in, the, west, seen, in, the, west, as, distinctively, japanese, this, style, actually, owed, a, lot, to, imported, pigments, and, western, influences, and, had, been, created, with, export, in, mind, workshops, in, many, cities, raced, to, produce, this, style, to, satisfy, demand, from, europe, and, america, often, producing, quickly, and, cheaply, so, the, term, satsuma, ware, came, to, be, associated, not, with, a, place, of, origin, but, with, lower, quality, ware, created, purely, for, export, despite, this, artists, such, as, yabu, meizan, and, makuzu, k, zan, maintained, the, highest, artistic, standards, while, also, successfully, exporting, from, 1876, to, 1913, k, zan, won,

large, colourful, pictorial, works, were, being, produced, in, kyoto, embroidery, had, become, an, art, form, in, its, own, right, adopting, a, range, of, pictorial, techniques, such, as, chiaroscuro, and, aerial, perspective, immediately, following, japan, s, defeat, in, world, war, ii, in, 1945, large, numbers, of, japanese, artists, fell, under, the, influence, of, or, even, joined, the, japan, communist, party, which, had, just, been, legalized, by, the, u, s, led, military, occupation, of, japan, after, many, years, of, suppression, by, the, prewar, and, wartime, japanese, police, this, had, to, do, with, the, success, of, the, communist, party, had, in, peddling, the, notion, in, the, early, postwar, years, that, the, party, had, been, the, only, group, in, japan, to, have, resisted, wartime, militarism, in, addition, the, japanese, word, for, vanguard, zen, ei, as, in, vanguard, of, the, communist, revolution, happens, to, be, the, same, word, used, for, avant, garde, as, in, the, artistic, avant, garde, the, japan, communist, party, soon, came, to, dominate, the, major, art, societies, and, exhibitions, in, japan, and, thus, the, predominant, form, of, art, in, the, immediate, aftermath, of, the, war, was, socialist, realism, that, depicted, the, suffering, of, the, poor, and, the, nobility, of, the, working, class, in, line, with, communist, party, doctrine, that, all, art, should, serve, the, purpose, of, advancing, the, cause, of, revolution, in, 1952, the, communist, party, even, ordered, artists, such, as, hiroshi, katsuragawa, and, other, members, of, the, newly, formed, avant, garde, art, association, zen, ei, bijutsukai, out, into, the, mountains, to, produce, socialist, realist, art, in, support, of, mountain, guerrilla, squads, that, were, attempting, to, foment, a, violent, revolution, in, japan, over, the, course, of, the, 1950s, many, japanese, artists, became, increasingly, disillusioned, with, the, rigid, and, limited, definition, of, art, enforced, by, the, communist, party, however, due, to, the, ongoing, preeminence, of, communist, party, members, and, supporters, in, the, senior, ranks, of, artistic, societies, and, exhibition, juries, artists, found, it, extremely, difficult, to, even, show, their, art, unless, they, conformed, to, the, party, s, guidelines, some, artists, shied, away, from, formal, public, exhibitions, others, sought, recognition, financial, support, and, opportunities, to, show, their, art, overseas, such, as, the, gutai, group, of, conceptual, artists, founded, in, 1954, still, other, artists, made, use, of, the, few, unjuried, independent, exhibitions, in, japan, such, as, the, yomiuri, ind, pendant, exhibition, sponsored, by, the, yomiuri, shimbun, which, anyone, could, enter, a, final, straw, came, with, the, massive, 1960, anpo, protests, against, the, u, s, japan, security, treaty, known, as, anpo, in, japanese, due, to, the, extremely, passive, role, played, by, the, supposedly, vanguard, communist, party, when, the, protests, failed, to, stop, the, treaty, a, round, of, recriminations, led, to, further, disillusionment, with, the, communist, party, and, socialist, realist, art, causing, many, more, artists, to, break, away, from, the, party, s, influence, with, the, dominance, of, socialist, realism, fading, the, 1960s, witnessed, an, explosion, of, new, art, forms, in, japan, as, the, arts, expanded, in, new, directions, that, might, best, be, termed, postmodern, artist, collectives, such, as, neo, dada, organizers, zero, dimension, and, hi, red, center, explored, concepts, such, as, non, art, and, anti, art, and, conducted, a, variety, of, audacious, events, happenings, and, other, forms, of, performance, art, designed, to, erode, the, boundaries, between, art, and, daily, life, the, mono, ha, group, similarly, pushed, the, boundaries, dividing, art, space, landscape, and, the, environment, other, artists, such, as, graphic, designer, tadanori, yokoo, drew, inspiration, from, 1960s, counterculture, and, the, explosion, of, new, forms, of, adult, oriented, manga, comics, in, the, performing, arts, tatsumi, hijikata, pioneered, a, new, form, of, postmodern, dance, called, butoh, and, playwrights, such, as, j, r, kara, and, sat, makoto, created, the, angura, style, of, radical, underground, theater, and, in,

phrases, by, at, least, the, 10th, or, 11th, century, the, courtly, refinements, of, the, aristocratic, heian, period, evolved, into, the, elegant, simplicity, seen, as, the, essence, of, good, taste, in, the, understated, art, that, is, called, shibui, two, terms, originating, from, zen, buddhist, meditative, practices, describe, degrees, of, tranquility, one, the, repose, found, in, humble,

and, in, clashing, poetic, imagery, unexpectedly, humorous, and, sometimes, grotesque, images, and, motifs, also, stem, from, the, zen, k, an, conundrum, although, the, arts, have, been, mainly, secular, since, the, edo, period, traditional, aesthetics, and, training, methods, stemming, generally, from, religious, sources, continue, to, underlie, artistic, productions, modern, japanese, art, is, often, heavily, influenced, by, the, nation, s, unique, relationship, with, technology, frequently, marrying, traditional, forms, and, concepts, with, new, aesthetics, and, anxieties, of, the, technological, present, as, well, as, being, heavily, influenced, by, the, nation, s, varied, economic, history, following, the, second, world, war, modern, japanese, art, engages, heavily, with, themes, of, isolation, and, depersonalization, as, well, as, the, growing, power, and, influence, of, digital, technologies, and, the, degree, to, which, japanese, culture, is, affected, by, and, exerts, influence, on, an, increasingly, globalized, and, interconnected, world, as, japan, was, one, of, the, first, nations, to, be, connected, to, the, internet, on, a, large, scale, and, one, of, the, first, countries, to, adopt, widespread, cellphone, use, japanese, art, was, among, the, first, forms, of, art, to, critically, evaluate, the, dramatic, social, effects, that, ubiquitous, connectivity, have, had, on, society, conversely, the, amount, of, japanese, art, distributed, on, the, internet, meant, that, japanese, art, and, aesthetics, including, mass, culture, art, such, as, manga, and, anime, were, enormously, influential, on, internet, culture, throughout, the, 1990s, and, 2000s, an, influence, that, is, not, only, still, felt, today, but, also, encouraged, japanese, artists, to, continue, to, critically, explore, the, nature, of, online, life, japanese, art, has, also, been, influenced, by, the, increasing, role, of, the, nation, s, mass, culture, art, in, global, pop, culture, manga, anime, video, games, mass, market, movies, and, associated, cultural, products, have, continued, to, become, larger, and, more, influential, within, the, world, of, japanese, art, since, the, 1970s, and, themes, expressed, in, these, works, have, often, mirrored, the, nation, s, current, anxieties, the, aesthetic, language, and, conventions, of, these, media, have, increasingly, come, to, represent, the, totality, of, japanese, art, and, culture, abroad, as, well, the, aesthetic, of, kawaii, for, example, originally, was, derived, from, traditional, concepts, within, japanese, art, dating, back, to, the, 15th, century, but, was, explored, within, popular, manga, and, anime, series, in, postwar, japan, and, today, is, commonly, seen, as, central, to, contemporary, japanese, culture, traditional, japanese, aesthetics, are, forms, of, beauty, in, japanese, culture, that, derive, from, the, earliest, centuries, at, least, over, two, hundred, years, ago, some, of, these, early, aesthetics, make, up, the, japanese, aesthetic, as, a, whole, syncretic, buddhist, art, wabi, sabi, miyabi, shibui, and, jo, ha, kyu, this, aesthetic, in, japanese, culture, is, known, for, many, things, such, as, beauty, in, all, things, even, those, that, are, imperfect, modesty, and, unconventional, things, are, what, are, seen, as, the, wabi, sabi, aesthetic, wabi, and, sabi, both, make, up, the, aesthetic, of, beauty, in, incompleteness, together, when, separated, both, serve, as, differing, terms, wabi, stands, for, fresh, simple, work, denoting, all, complication, and, having, a, very, rustic, feel, to, all, it, relates, too, being, made, from, nature, and, made, from, man, itself, in, a, tandem, if, made, by, accident, it, brings, about, a, certain, uniqueness, to, the, work, sabi, is, beauty, and, how, it, originates, from, age, the, cycle, of, life, plays, a, great, role, in, sabi, adding, to, the, aesthetic, that, sense, of, beauty, in, works, that, receive, mending, damage, from, aging, over, time, when, bringing, wabi, and, sabi, together, it, creates, the, aesthetic, that, every, simple, piece, developed, does, not, require, a, complicated, design, nor, does, it, require, absolute, completeness, for, beauty, to, be, found, in, it, and, with, age, comes, more, delicate, beauty, wabi, sabi, has, always, been, related, to, tea, ceremonies, in, japanese, culture, it, is, said, that, these, ceremonies, are, profound, wabi, sabi, events, wabi, sabi, is, also, related, to, activities, such, as, architecture, fashion, and, philosophy, all, of, these, portions, of, wabi, sabi, all, share, belief, in, the, same, theme, all, imperfections, such, as, incomplete, work, holds, undeniable, beauty, however, not, everyone, of, course, favors, the, idea, behind, wabi, sabi, while, this, is, true, there, are, many, who, wish, to, keep, the, belief, alive, despite, what, others, believe, overall, wabi, sabi, seems, to, be, a, very, mindful, approach, to, everyday, life, a, calm, way, to, see, things, and, a, way, to, live, without, coming, off, as, judgmental, when, understanding, wabi, sabi, there, are, terms, that, strongly, relate, to, the, aesthetic, as, well, each, of, these, terms, are, used, to, break, down, the, complete, understanding, of, wabi, sabi, it, more, so, relates, to, the, philosophy, aspect, of, the, entire, aesthetic, and, how, to, view, one, s, surroundings, these, can, allude, to, several, things, including, the, ideas, in, humans, the, themes, behind, certain, aspects, of, life, or, nature, itself, each, term, leads, back, to, the, point, that, wabi, sabi, is, an, aesthetic, that, is, about, appreciating, the, small, things, that, are, imperfect, and, or, incomplete, in, the, ongoing, history, of, japan, miyabi, can, stand, for, many, things, however, it, seems, to, be, centered, around, the, concept, of, elegance, beauty, refinement, and, courtliness, for, this, it, is, one, of, the, older, aesthetics, among, most, of, the, japanese, aesthetics, in, the, culture, that, would, explain, why, it, is, not, as, popular, as, the, rest, which, may, be, newer, compared, to, miyabi, it, is, a, term, that, is, also, used, to, express, aristocratic, culture, miyabi, eliminates, all, forms, of, rudeness, and, crudity, from, the, culture, this, brings, about, the, proper, picture, and, form, of, aristocratic, culture, miyabi, brings, about, these, changes, miyabi, ensures, that, refinement, of, love, literature, feeling, and, art, is, celebrated, within, the, japanese,

it, comes, to, designing, or, reviewing, certain, designs, in, many, ways, shibui, is, very, similar, to, wabi, sabi, but, is, not, wabi, sabi, shibui, appreciates, items, and, objects, for, simply, being, there, is, no, complication, or, irrational, thinking, when, it, comes, down, to, shibui, akin, to, certain, aesthetics, in, the, japanese, culture, there, are, a, couple, of, terms, in, relation, to, shibui, shibumi, is, the, taste, of, shibui, shibusa, is, the, state, of, shibui, both, these, terms, relate, to, subtle, unobtrusive, beauty, there, are, several, items, and, objects, that, can, be, considered, a, part, of, the, shibui, aesthetic, not, just, art, or, fashion, it, can, also, be, people, animals, songs, movies, several, different, types, of, media, can, be, seen, as, shibui, for, example, a, pair, of, shoes, a, camera, a, moped, bike, and, several, different, pieces, of, art, or, objects, used, for, everyday, activity, can, be, seen, as, shibui, direct, and, simple, is, the, way, of, shibui, nothing, over, the, top, or, too, flashy, this, is, an, aesthetic, that, originated, from, the, noh, theatre, and, even, appeared, in, the, 14th, century, it, is, used, in, different, art, forms, in, japan, even, still, today, it, is, a, movement, that, has, been, applied, in, several, different, arts, with, jo, ha, and, kyu, standing, for, individual, things, to, make, up, its, definition, jo, beginning, ha, break, crack, kyu, rapid, over, essentially, what, this, aesthetic, means, is, that, when, it, comes, down, to, pieces, that, deal, with, movement, things, should, start, slowly, with, proper, build, up, almost, akin, to, how, a, story, is, told, then, once, it, reaches, its, climax, it, speeds, up, when, it, reaches, its, end, then, that, is,
