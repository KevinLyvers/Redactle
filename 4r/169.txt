phelpses, in, order, of, appearance, adventures, of, huckleberry, finn, explores, themes, of, race, and, identity, what, it, means, to, be, free, and, civilized, and, the, ideas, of, humanity, and, social, responsibility, in, the, changing, landscape, of, america, a, complexity, exists, concerning, jim, s, character, while, some, scholars, point, out, that, jim, is, good, hearted, and, moral, and, he, is, not, unintelligent, in, contrast, to, several, of, the, more, negatively, depicted, white, characters, others, have, criticized, the, novel, as, racist, citing, the, use, of, the, word, nigger, and, emphasizing, the, stereotypically, comic, treatment, of, jim, s, lack, of, education, superstition, and, ignorance, this, argument, is, supported, by, incidents, early, in, the, novel, where, huck, deliberately, tricks, jim, taking, advantage, of, his, gullibility, and, jim, still, remains, loyal, to, him, but, this, novel, is, also, huck, s, coming, of, age, story, where, he, overcomes, his, initial, biases, and, forms, a, deeper, bond, with, jim, throughout, the, story, huck, is, in, moral, conflict, with, the, received, values, of, the, society, in, which, he, lives, huck, is, unable, consciously, to, rebut, those, values, even, in, his, thoughts, but, he, makes, a, moral, choice, based, on, his, own, valuation, of, jim, s, friendship, and, human, worth, a, decision, in, direct, opposition, to, the, things, he, has, been, taught, twain, in, his, lecture, notes, proposes, that, a, sound, heart, is, a, surer, guide, than, an, ill, trained, conscience, and, goes, on, to, describe, the, novel, as, a, book, of, mine, where, a, sound, heart, and, a, deformed, conscience, come, into, collision, and, conscience, suffers, defeat, to, highlight, the, hypocrisy, required, to, condone, slavery, within, an, ostensibly, moral, system, twain, has, huck, s, father, enslave, his, son, isolate, him, and, beat, him, when, huck, escapes, he, immediately, encounters, jim, illegally, doing, the, same, thing, the, treatments, both, of, them, receive, are, radically, different, especially, in, an, encounter, with, mrs, judith, loftus, who, takes, pity, on, who, she, presumes, to, be, a, runaway, apprentice, huck, yet, boasts, about, her, husband, sending, the, hounds, after, a, runaway, slave, jim, some, scholars, discuss, huck, s, own, character, and, the, novel, itself, in, the, context, of, its, relation, to, african, american, culture, as, a, whole, john, alberti, quotes, shelley, fisher, fishkin, who, writes, in, her, 1990s, book, was, huck, black, mark, twain, and, african, american, voices, by, limiting, their, field, of, inquiry, to, the, periphery, white, scholars, have, missed, the, ways, in, which, african, american, voices, shaped, twain, s, creative, imagination, at, its, core, it, is, suggested, that, the, character, of, huckleberry, finn, illustrates, the, correlation, and, even, interrelatedness, between, white, and, black, culture, in, the, united, states, the, original, illustrations, were, done, by, e, w, kemble, at, the, time, a, young, artist, working, for, life, magazine, kemble, was, hand, picked, by, twain, who, admired, his, work, hearn, suggests, that, twain, and, kemble, had, a, similar, skill, writing, that, whatever, he, may, have, lacked, in, technical, grace, kemble, shared, with, the, greatest, illustrators, the, ability, to, give, even, the, minor, individual, in, a, text, his, own, distinct, visual, personality, just, as, twain, so, deftly, defined, a, full, rounded, character, in, a, few, phrases, so, too, did, kemble, depict, with, a, few, strokes, of, his, pen, that, same, entire, personage, as, kemble, could, afford, only, one, model, most, of, his, illustrations, produced, for, the, book, were, done, by, guesswork, when, the, novel, was, published, the, illustrations, were, praised, even, as, the, novel, was, harshly, criticized, e, w, kemble, produced, another, set, of, illustrations, for, harper, s, and, the, american, publishing, company, in, 1898, and, 1899, after, twain, lost, the, copyright, twain, initially, conceived, of, the, work, as, a, sequel, to, the, adventures, of, tom, sawyer, that, would, follow, huckleberry, finn, through, adulthood, beginning, with, a, few, pages, he, had, removed, from, the, earlier, novel, twain, began, work, on, a, manuscript, he, originally, titled, huckleberry, finn, s, autobiography, twain, worked, on, the, manuscript, off, and, on, for, the, next, several, years, ultimately, abandoning, his, original, plan, of, following, huck, s, development, into, adulthood, he, appeared, to, have, lost, interest, in, the, manuscript, while, it, was, in, progress, and, set, it, aside, for, several, years, after, making, a, trip, down, the, hudson, river, twain, returned, to, his, work, on, the, novel, upon, completion, the, novel, s, title, closely, paralleled, its, predecessor, s, adventures, of, huckleberry, finn, tom, sawyer, s, comrade, mark, twain, composed, the, story, in, pen, on, notepaper, between, 1876, and, 1883, paul, needham, who, supervised, the, authentication, of, the, manuscript, for, sotheby, s, books, and, manuscripts, department, in, new, york, in, 1991, stated, what, you, see, is, attempt, to, move, away, from, pure, literary, writing, to, dialect, writing, for, example, twain, revised, the, opening, line, of, huck, finn, three, times, he, initially, wrote, you, will, not, know, about, me, which, he, changed, to, you, do, not, know, about, me, before, settling, on, the, final, version, you, don, t, know, about, me, without, you, have, read, a, book, by, the, name, of, the, adventures, of, tom, sawyer, but, that, ain, t, no, matter, the, revisions, also, show, how, twain, reworked, his, material, to, strengthen, the, characters, of, huck, and, jim, as, well, as, his, sensitivity, to, the, then, current, debate, over, literacy, and, voting, a, later, version, was, the, first, typewritten, manuscript, delivered, to, a, printer, demand, for, the, book, spread, outside, of, the, united, states, adventures, of, huckleberry, finn, was, eventually, published, on, december, 10, 1884, in, canada, and, the, united, kingdom, and, on, february, 18, 1885, in, the, united, states, the, illustration, on, page, 283, became, a, point, of, issue, after, an, engraver, whose, identity, was, never, discovered, made, a, last, minute, addition, to, the, printing, plate, of, kemble, s, picture, of, old, silas, phelps, which, drew, attention, to, phelps, groin, thirty, thousand, copies, of, the, book, had, been, printed, before, the, obscenity, was, discovered, a, new, plate, was, made, to, correct, the, illustration, and, repair, the, existing, copies, in, 1885, the, buffalo, public, library, s, curator, james, fraser, gluck, approached, twain, to, donate, the, manuscript, to, the, library, twain, did, so, later, it, was, believed, that, half, of, the, pages, had, been, misplaced, by, the, printer, in, 1991, the, missing, first, half, turned, up, in, a, steamer, trunk, owned, by, descendants, of, gluck, s, the, library, successfully, claimed, possession, and, in, 1994, opened, the, mark, twain, room, to, showcase, the, treasure, in, relation, to, the, literary, climate, at, the, time, of, the, book, s, publication, in, 1885, henry, nash, smith, describes, the, importance, of, mark, twain, s, already, established, reputation, as, a, professional, humorist, having, already, published, over, a, dozen, other, works, smith, suggests, that, while, the, dismantling, of, the, decadent, romanticism, of, the, later, nineteenth, century, was, a, necessary, operation, adventures, of, huckleberry, finn, illustrated, previously, inaccessible, resources, of, imaginative, power, but, also, made, vernacular, language, with, its, new, sources, of, pleasure, and, new, energy, available, for, american, prose, and, poetry, in, the, twentieth, century, while, it, is, clear, that, adventures, of, huckleberry, finn, was, controversial, from, the, outset, norman, mailer, writing, in, the, new, york, times, in, 1984, concluded, that, twain, s, novel, was, not, initially, too, unpleasantly, regarded, in, fact, mailer, writes, the, critical, climate, could, hardly, anticipate, t, s, eliot, and, ernest, hemingway, s, encomiums, 50, years, later, reviews, that, would, remain, longstanding, in, the, american, consciousness, alberti, suggests, that, the, academic, establishment, responded, to, the, book, s, challenges, both, dismissively, and, with, confusion, during, twain, s, time, and, today, defenders, of, adventures, of, huckleberry, finn, lump, all, nonacademic, critics, of, the, book, together, as, extremists, and, censors, thus, equating, the, complaints, about, the, book, s, coarseness, from, the, genteel, bourgeois, trustees, of, the, concord, public, library, in, the, 1880s, with, more, recent, objections, based, on, race, and, civil, rights, upon, issue, of, the, american, edition, in, 1885, several, libraries, banned, it, from, their, shelves, the, early, criticism, focused, on, what, was, perceived, as, the, book, s, crudeness, one, incident, was, recounted, in, the, newspaper, the, boston, transcript, the, concord, mass, public, library, committee, has, decided, to, exclude, mark, twain, s, latest, book, from, the, library, one, member, of, the, committee, says, that, while, he, does, not, wish, to, call, it, immoral, he, thinks, it, contains, but, little, humor, and, that, of, a, very, coarse, type, he, regards, it, as, the, veriest, trash, the, library, and, the, other, members, of, the, committee, entertain, similar, views, characterizing, it, as, rough, coarse, and, inelegant, dealing, with, a, series, of, experiences, not, elevating, the, whole, book, being, more, suited, to, the, slums, than, to, intelligent, respectable, people, writer, louisa, may, alcott, criticized, the, book, s, publication, as, well, saying, that, if, twain, think, of, something, better, to, tell, our, pure, minded, lads, and, lasses, he, had, best, stop, writing, for, them, in, 1905, new, york, s, brooklyn, public, library, also, banned, the, book, due, to, bad, word, choice, and, huck, s, having, not, only, itched, but, scratched, within, the, novel, which, was, considered, obscene, when, asked, by, a, brooklyn, librarian, about, the, situation, twain, sardonically, replied, i, am, greatly, troubled, by, what, you, say, i, wrote, tom, sawyer, huck, finn, for, adults, exclusively, it, always, distressed, me, when, i, find, that, boys, and, girls, have, been, allowed, access, to, them, the, mind, that, becomes, soiled, in, youth, can, never, again, be, washed, clean, i, know, this, by, my, own, experience, to, this, day, i, cherish, an, unappeased, bitterness, against, the, unfaithful, guardians, of, my, young, life, who, not, only, permitted, but, compelled, me, to, read, an, unexpurgated, bible, through, before, i, was, 15, years, old, none, can, do, that, and, ever, draw, a, clean, sweet, breath, again, on, this, side, of, the, grave, many, subsequent, critics, ernest, hemingway, among, them, have, deprecated, the, final, chapters, claiming, the, book, devolves, into, little, more, than, minstrel, show, satire, and, broad, comedy, after, jim, is, detained, although, hemingway, declared, all, modern, american, literature, comes, from, huck, finn, and, hailed, it, as, the, best, book, we, ve, had, he, cautioned, if, you, must, read, it, you, must, stop, where, the, nigger, jim, is, stolen, from, the, boys, that, is, the, real, end, the, rest, is, just, cheating, the, african, american, writer, ralph, ellison, argued, that, hemingway, missed, completely, the, structural, symbolic, and, moral, necessity, for, that, part, of, the, plot, in, which, the, boys, rescue, jim, yet, it, is, precisely, this, part, which, gives, the, novel, its, significance, pulitzer, prize, winner, ron, powers, states, in, his, twain, biography, mark, twain, a, life, that, huckleberry, finn, endures, as, a, consensus, masterpiece, despite, these, final, chapters, in, which, tom, sawyer, leads, huck, through, elaborate, machinations, to, rescue, jim, in, his, introduction, to, the, annotated, huckleberry, finn, michael, patrick, hearn, writes, that, twain, could, be, uninhibitedly, vulgar, and, quotes, critic, william, dean, howells, a, twain, contemporary, who, wrote, that, the, author, s, humor, was, not, for, most, women, however, hearn, continues, by, explaining, that, the, reticent, howells, found, nothing, in, the, proofs, of, huckleberry, finn, so, offensive, that, it, needed, to, be, struck, out, much, of, modern, scholarship, of, huckleberry, finn, has, focused, on, its, treatment, of, race, many, twain, scholars, have, argued, that, the, book, by, humanizing, jim, and, exposing, the, fallacies, of, the, racist, assumptions, of, slavery, is, an, attack, on, racism, others, have, argued, that, the, book, falls, short, on, this, score, especially, in, its, depiction, of, jim, according, to, professor, stephen, railton, of, the, university, of, virginia, twain, was, unable, to, fully, rise, above, the, stereotypes, of, black, people, that, white, readers, of, his, era, expected, and, enjoyed, and, therefore, resorted, to, minstrel, show, style, comedy, to, provide, humor, at, jim, s, expense, and, ended, up, confirming, rather, than, challenging, late, 19th, century, racist, stereotypes, in, one, instance, the, controversy, caused, a, drastically, altered, interpretation, of, the, text, in, 1955, cbs, tried, to, avoid, controversial, material, in, a, televised, version, of, the, book, by, deleting, all, mention, of, slavery, and, omitting, the, character, of, jim, entirely, because, of, this, controversy, over, whether, huckleberry, finn, is, racist, or, anti, racist, and, because, the, word, nigger, is, frequently, used, in, the, novel, a, commonly, used, word, in, twain, s, time, that, has, since, become, vulgar, and, taboo, many, have, questioned, the, appropriateness, of, teaching, the, book, in, the, u, s, public, school, system, this, questioning, of, the, word, nigger, is, illustrated, by, a, school, administrator, of, virginia, in, 1982, calling, the, novel, the, most, grotesque, example, of, racism, i, ve, ever, seen, in, my, life, according, to, the, american, library, association, huckleberry, finn, was, the, fifth, most, frequently, challenged, book, in, the, united, states, during, the, 1990s, there, have, been, several, more, recent, cases, involving, protests, for, the, banning, of, the, novel, in, 2003, high, school, student, calista, phair, and, her, grandmother, beatrice, clark, in, renton, washington, proposed, banning, the, book, from, classroom, learning, in, the, renton, school, district, though, not, from, any, public, libraries, because, of, the, word, nigger, the, two, curriculum, committees, that, considered, her, request, eventually, decided, to, keep, the, novel, on, the, 11th, grade, curriculum, though, they, suspended, it, until, a, panel, had, time, to, review, the, novel, and, set, a, specific, teaching, procedure, for, the, novel, s, controversial, topics, in, 2009, a, white, washington, state, high, school, teacher, john, foley, called, for, replacing, adventures, of, huckleberry, finn, with, a, more, modern, novel, in, an, opinion, column, that, foley, wrote, in, the, seattle, post, intelligencer, he, states, that, all, novels, that, use, the, n, word, repeatedly, need, to, go, he, states, that, teaching, the, novel, is, not, only, unnecessary, but, difficult, due, to, the, offensive, language, within, the, novel, with, many, students, becoming, uncomfortable, at, just, hear, the, n, word, in, 2016, adventures, of, huckleberry, finn, was, removed, from, a, public, school, district, in, virginia, along, with, the, novel, to, kill, a, mockingbird, due, to, their, use, of, racial, slurs, publishers, have, made, their, own, attempts, at, easing, the, controversy, by, way, of, releasing, editions, of, the, book, with, the, word, nigger, replaced, by, less, controversial, words, a, 2011, edition, of, the, book, published, by, newsouth, books, employed, the, word, slave, although, the, word, is, not, properly, applied, to, a, freed, man, their, argument, for, making, the, change, was, to, offer, the, reader, a, choice, of, reading, a, sanitized, version, if, they, were, not, comfortable, with, the, original, mark, twain, scholar, alan, gribben, said, he, hoped, the, edition, would, be, more, friendly, for, use, in, classrooms, rather, than, have, the, work, banned, outright, from, classroom, reading, lists, due, to, its, language, according, to, publisher, suzanne, la, rosa, at, newsouth, we, saw, the, value, in, an, edition, that, would, help, the, works, find, new, readers, if, the, publication, sparks, good, debate, about, how, language, impacts, learning, or, about, the, nature, of, censorship, or, the, way, in, which, racial, slurs, exercise, their, baneful, influence, then, our, mission, in, publishing, this, new, edition, of, twain, s, works, will, be, more, emphatically, fulfilled, another, scholar, thomas, wortham, criticized, the, changes, saying, the, new, edition, doesn, t, challenge, children, to, ask, why, would, a, child, like, huck, use, such, reprehensible, language
