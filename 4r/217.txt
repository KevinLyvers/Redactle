writer, declan, kiberd, before, joyce, no, writer, of, fiction, had, so, foregrounded, the, process, of, thinking, since, its, publication, the, book, has, attracted, controversy, and, scrutiny, ranging, from, an, obscenity, trial, in, the, united, states, in, 1921, to, protracted, disputes, about, the, authoritative, version, of, the, text, joyce, first, encountered, the, figure, of, odysseus, ulysses, in, charles, lamb, s, adventures, of, ulysses, an, adaptation, of, the, odyssey, for, children, which, seems, to, have, established, the, latin, name, in, joyce, s, mind, at, school, he, wrote, an, essay, on, the, character, titled, my, favourite, hero, joyce, told, frank, budgen, that, he, considered, ulysses, the, only, all, round, character, in, literature, he, considered, writing, another, short, story, for, dubliners, to, be, titled, ulysses, and, based, on, a, jewish, dubliner, named, alfred, h, hunter, a, putative, cuckold, the, idea, grew, from, a, story, in, 1906, to, a, short, book, in, 1907, to, the, vast, novel, he, began, in, 1914, the, action, of, the, novel, moves, from, one, side, of, dublin, bay, to, the, other, opening, in, sandycove,

do, not, have, chapter, headings, or, titles, and, are, numbered, only, in, gabler, s, edition, in, the, various, editions, the, breaks, between, episodes, are, indicated, in, different, ways, in, the, modern, library, edition, for, example, each, episode, begins, at, the, top, of, a, new, page, joyce, seems, to, have, relished, his, book, s, obscurity, saying, he, had, put, in, so, many, enigmas, and, puzzles, that, it, will, keep, the, professors, busy, for, centuries, arguing, over, what, i, meant, and, that, s, the, only, way, of, insuring, one, s, immortality, the, judge, who, decided, that, ulysses, was, not, obscene, admitted, that, it, is, not, an, easy, book, to, read, or, to, understand, and, advised, reading, a, number, of, other, books, which, have, now, become, its, satellites, one, such, book, available, at, the, time, was, herbert, gorman, s, first, book, on, joyce, which, included, his, own, brief, list, of, correspondences, between, ulysses, and, the, odyssey, another, was, stuart, gilbert, s, study, of, ulysses, which, included, a, schema, of, the, novel, joyce, created, gilbert, was, later, quoted, in, the, legal, brief, prepared, for, the, obscenity, trial, joyce, had, already, sent, carlo, linati, a, different, schema, the, gilbert, and, linati, schemata, made, the, links, to, the, odyssey, clearer, and, also, explained, the, work, s, structure, the, 18, episodes, of, ulysses, roughly, correspond, to, the, episodes, in, homer, s, odyssey, in, homer, s, epic, odysseus, a, greek, hero, of, the, trojan, war, took, ten, years, to, find, his, way, from, troy, to, his, home, on, the, island, of, ithaca, homer, s, poem, includes, violent, storms, and, a, shipwreck, giants, monsters, gods, and, goddesses, while, joyce, s, novel, takes, place, during, an, ordinary, day, in, early, 20th, century, dublin, leopold, bloom, a, jewish, advertisement, canvasser, corresponds, to, odysseus, in, homer, s, epic, stephen, dedalus, the, protagonist, of, joyce, s, earlier, largely, autobiographical, a, portrait, of, the, artist, as, a, young, man, corresponds, to, odysseus, s, son, telemachus, and, bloom, s, wife, molly, corresponds, to, penelope, odysseus, s, wife, who, waited, 20, years, for, him, to, return, the, odyssey, is, divided, into, 24, books, which, are, divided, into, 3, parts, of, 4, 8, and, 12, books, although, ulysses, has, fewer, episodes, their, division, into, 3, parts, of, 3, 12, and, 3, episodes, is, determined, by, the, tripartite, division, of, the, odyssey, joyce, referred, to, the, episodes, by, their, homeric, titles, in, his, letters, the, novel, s, text, does, not, include, the, episode, titles, used, below, which, originate, from, the, linati, and, gilbert, schemata, joyce, scholars, have, drawn, upon, both, to, identify, and, explain, the, parallels, between, ulysses, and, the, odyssey, scholars, have, argued, that, victor, berard, s, les, ph, niciens, et, l, odyss, e, which, joyce, discovered, in, zurich, while, writing, ulysses, influenced, his, creation, of, the, novel, s, homeric, parallels, berard, s, theory, that, the, odyssey, had, semitic, roots, accords, with, joyce, s, reincarnation, of, odysseus, as, the, jewish, leopold, bloom, ezra, pound, regarded, the, homeric, correspondences, as, a, scaffold, a, means, of, construction, justified, by, the, result, and, justifiable, by, it, only, the, result, is, a, triumph, in, form, in, balance, a, main, schema, with, continuous, weaving, and, arabesque, for, t, s, eliot, the, homeric, correspondences, had, the, importance, of, a, scientific, discovery, he, wrote, in, manipulating, a, continuous, parallel, between, contemporaneity, and, antiquity, mr, joyce, is, pursing, a, method, which, others, must, pursue, after, him, this, method, is, simply, a, way, of, controlling, of, ordering, of, giving, a, shape, and, significance, to, the, immense, panorama, of, futility, and, anarchy, which, is, contemporary, history, after, homer, s, odyssey, the, literary, work, ulysses, parallels, most, closely, is, shakespeare, s, hamlet, the, play, is, mentioned, in, telemachus, hamlet, is, a, symbol, in, the, linati, schema, in, the, library, episode, stephen, dedalus, puts, forth, a, theory, of, hamlet, based, on, 12, lectures, now, lost, that, joyce, gave, in, trieste, in, 1912, chief, among, the, implied, parallels, with, ulysses, are, shakespeare, and, joyce, king, hamlet, and, leopold, bloom, and, prince, hamlet, and, stephen, according, to, stephen, shakespeare, has, a, double, presence, in, hamlet, the, king, is, the, mature, shakespeare, the, prince, is, shakespeare, as, a, young, man, stephen, s, insistence, on, shakespeare, s, double, presence, in, hamlet, hints, at, joyce, s, double, presence, in, ulysses, bloom, is, the, mature, joyce, stephen, is, joyce, as, a, young, man, there, are, also, correspondences, with, other, figures, including, christ, elijah, moses, dante, and, don, giovanni, like, shakespeare, dante, was, a, major, influence, on, joyce, it, has, been, argued, that, the, interrelationship, of, joyce, dedalus, and, bloom, is, defined, in, the, incarnation, doctrines, stephen, lists, in, telemachus, at, 8, a, m, malachi, buck, mulligan, a, boisterous, medical, student, calls, aspiring, writer, stephen, dedalus, up, to, the, roof, of, the, sandycove, martello, tower, where, they, both, live, there, is, tension, between, dedalus, and, mulligan, stemming, from, a, cruel, remark, dedalus, overheard, mulligan, make, about, his, recently, deceased, mother, and, from, the, fact, that, mulligan, has, invited, an, english, student, haines, to, stay, with, them, the, three, men, eat, breakfast, and, walk, to, the, shore, where, mulligan, demands, from, stephen, the, key, to, the, tower, and, a, loan, the, three, make, plans, to, meet, at, a, pub, the, ship, at, 12, 30pm, departing, stephen, decides, that, he, will, not,

stephen, leaves, deasy, jokes, that, ireland, has, never, persecuted, the, jews, because, the, country, never, let, them, in, this, episode, is, the, source, of, some, of, the, novel, s, best, known, lines, such, as, dedalus, s, claim, that, history, is, a, nightmare, from, which, i, am, trying, to, awake, and, that, god, is, a, shout, in, the, street, stephen, walks, along, sandymount, strand,

left, on, the, shelf, after, several, mental, digressions, he, decides, to, visit, mina, purefoy, at, the, maternity, hospital, it, is, uncertain, how, much, of, the, episode, is, gerty, s, thoughts, and, how, much, is, bloom, s, sexual, fantasy, some, believe, that, the, episode, is, divided, into, two, halves, the, first, half, the, highly, romanticized, viewpoint, of, gerty, and, the, other, half, that, of, the, older, and, more, realistic, bloom, joyce, himself, said, however, that, nothing, happened, between, it, all, took, place, in, bloom, s, imagination, nausicaa, attracted, immense, notoriety, while, the, book, was, being, published, in, serial, form, it, has, also, attracted, great, attention, from, scholars, of, disability, in, literature, the, style, of, the, first, half, of, the, episode, borrows, from, and, parodies, romance, magazines, and, novelettes, bloom, s, contemplation, of, gerty, parodies, dedalus, s, vision, of, the, wading, girl, at, the, seashore, in, a, portrait, of, the, artist, as, a, young, man, bloom, visits, the, maternity, hospital, where, mina, purefoy, is, giving, birth, and, finally, meets, stephen, who, has, been, drinking, with, his,

they, continue, on, to, a, pub, to, continue, drinking, following, the, successful, birth, of, a, son, to, mina, purefoy, this, chapter, is, remarkable, for, joyce, s, wordplay, which, among, other, things, recapitulates, the, entire, history, of, the, english, language, after, a, short, incantation, the, episode, starts, with, latinate, prose, anglo, saxon, alliteration, and, moves, on, through, parodies, of, among, others, malory, the, king, james, bible, bunyan, pepys, defoe, sterne, walpole, gibbon, dickens, and, carlyle, before, concluding, in, a, joycean, version, of, contemporary,

himself, to, be, a, woman, in, this, fantasy, bloom, imagines, himself, or, herself, in, the, hallucination, being, dominated, by, bello, who, both, sexually, and, verbally, humiliates, bloom, bloom, also, interacts, with, other, imaginary, characters, in, this, scene, before, the, hallucination, ends, after, the, hallucination, ends, bloom, sees, stephen, overpay, at, the, brothel, and, decides, to, hold, onto, the, rest, of, stephen, s, money, for, safekeeping, stephen, hallucinates, that, his, mother, s, rotting, cadaver, has, risen, up, from, the, floor, to, confront, him, he, cries, non,

him, about, his, day, the, episode, is, written, in, the, form, of, a, rigidly, organised, and, mathematical, catechism, of, 309, questions, and, answers, and, was, reportedly, joyce, s, favourite, episode, in, the, novel, the, deep, descriptions, range, from, questions, of, astronomy, to, the, trajectory, of, urination, and, include, a, list, of, 25, men, that, purports, to, be, the, preceding, series, of, molly, s, suitors, and, bloom, s, reflections, on, them, while, describing, events, apparently, chosen, randomly, in, ostensibly, precise, mathematical, or, scientific, terms, the, episode, is, rife, with, errors, made, by, the, undefined, narrator, many, or, most, of, which, are, intentional, by, joyce, the, final, episode, consists, of, molly, bloom, s, thoughts, as, she, lies, in, bed, next, to, her, husband, the, episode, uses, a, stream, of, consciousness, technique, in, eight, paragraphs, and, lacks, punctuation, molly, thinks, about, boylan, and, bloom, her, past, admirers, including, lieutenant, stanley, g, gardner, the, events, of, the, day, her, childhood, in, gibraltar, and, her, curtailed, singing, career, she, also, hints, at, a, lesbian, relationship, in, her, youth, with, a, childhood, friend, hester, stanhope, these, thoughts, are, occasionally, interrupted, by, distractions, such, as, a, train, whistle, or, the, need, to, urinate, molly, is, surprised, by, the, early, arrival, of, her, menstrual, period, which, she, ascribes, to, her, vigorous, sex, with, boylan, the, episode, concludes, with, molly, s, remembrance, of, bloom, s,

mulligan, claims, that, stephen, s, hamlet, theory, draws, on, thomas, aquinas, and, in, the, library, episode, he, reveals, that, stephen, consulted, the, summa, contra, gentiles, joyce, apparently, owned, three, copies, one, was, an, english, abridgment, with, annotations, which, he, purchased, in, trieste, in, 1913, 14, this, book, which, he, told, ezra, pound, he, had, consulted, on, his, behalf, was, joseph, rickaby, s, of, god, and, his, creatures, shortly, after, his, hamlet, theory, is, mentioned, in, telemachus, stephen, thinks, of, christological, doctrines, that, aquinas, has, discussed, in, the, summa, the, catholic, doctrine, of, consubstantiality, and, the, heresies, of, sabellius, photius, arius, and, valentine, in, explaining, his, hamlet, theory, stephen, refers, to, both, consubstantiality, and, the, heresy, of, sabellius, according, to, catholic, doctrine, the, father, son, and, holy, ghost, are, separate, persons, sharing, the, same, nature, joyce, and, stephen, are, spiritually, consubstantial, in, telemachus, stephen, juxtaposes, the, christological, doctrines, with, the, symbol, of, the, apostles, in, the, mass, for, pope, marcellus, in, fact, the, nicene, creed, not, the, apostles, creed, is, sung, or, recited, during, mass, the, apostles, creed, reflects, the, doctrine, of, consubstantiality, and, so, applies, to, stephen, stephen, is, also, joyce, s, voice, in, ulysses, the, schism, between, the, latin, and, greek, churches, for, which, photius, was, mainly, responsible, was, due, to, the, filioque, clause, in, the, nicene, creed, the, greek, church, rejected, the, clause, the, result, according, to, aquinas, is, that, the, son, and, the, holy, ghost, are, held, to, be, the, same, person, at, the, baptism, the, holy, ghost, is, identified, with, the, voice, of, god, the, father, through, stephen, joyce, again, delivers, his, 1912, lectures, on, hamlet, sabellius, taught, that, the, father, son, and, holy, ghost, are, not, separate, persons, but, manifestations, of, a, single, divine, being, joyce, and, bloom, are, the, same, person, in, calypso, bloom, defines, metempsychosis, the, transmigration, of, souls, in, lotus,

the, immediate, source, for, stephen, s, parody, photius, is, a, reminder, that, stephen, is, joyce, s, voice, in, ulysses, stephen, s, parody, reflects, the, sabellian, heresy, and, so, applies, to, bloom, in, circe, bloom, and, stephen, share, the, apparition, of, shakespeare, who, speaks, in, dignified, ventriloquy, as, joyce, s, reincarnation, bloom, is, also, his, voice, his, views, accord, with, joyce, s, for, example, he, advocates, love, the, opposite, of, hatred, as, narratives, of, christ, s, mission, both, the, apostles, creed, and, stephen, s, parody, end, with, the, last, judgment, the, second, coming, of, christ, in, ulysses, not, only, are, bloom, and, stephen, both, christ, figures, but, the, first, coming, of, christ, is, intertwined, with, the, second, bloom, and, stephen, not, only, endure, but, pass, judgment, arius, held, that, the, son, is, one, with, god, the, father, not, by, nature, for, arius, the, father, son, relation, is, one, of, adoption, like,

like, the, sabellian, christ, bloom, is, both, a, son, and, a, father, while, stephen, like, the, consubstantial, christ, is, only, a, son, the, theological, terms, are, a, late, reminder, of, joyce,

him, on, the, mild, morning, air, he, held, the, bowl, aloft, and, intoned, introibo, ad, altare, dei, the, latin, is, the, first, line, the, priest, speaks, in, the, mass, in, 1904, it, was, said, in, latin, the, liturgical, items, and, actions, represented, have, been, identified, if, not, uniformly, the, most, obvious, correspondence, is, between, mulligan, s, shaving, bowl, and, the, chalice, of, sacramental, wine, that, the, shaving, implements, are, crossed, is, a, reminder, that, the, eucharist, is, meant, to, be, the, crucified, christ, joyce, was, familiar, with, the, greek, orthodox, liturgy, stephen, reacts, to, mulligan, s, performance, by, thinking, of, him, as, chrysostomos, an, orthodox, priest, and, the, author, of, a, liturgy, the, greek, orthodox, also, believe, in, the, doctrine, of, transubstantiation, mulligan, s, razor, represents, the, symbolically, named, holy, lance, the, knife, the, greek, priest, uses, to, cut, the, bread, to, be, consecrated, his,

recitation, of, the, epiclesis, the, invocation, to, god, the, father, to, send, down, the, holy, spirit, to, change, the, bread, and, wine, into, the, body, and, blood, of, christ, it, is, recited, in, all, greek, liturgies, including, the, liturgy, of, saint, john, chrysostomos, the, epiclesis, includes, all, three, members, of, the, trinity, in, the, act, of, transubstantiation, the, most, striking, feature, of, mulligan, s, parody, is, the, change, to, the, words, of, transubstantiation, this, is, my, body, this, is, my, blood, for, this, o, dearly, beloved, is, the, genuine, christine, body, and, soul, and, blood, and, ouns, as, he, did, in, the, sisters, the, first, dubliners, story, joyce, has, replaced, the, latin, rite, with, a, homely, simulacrum, father, flynn, s,

raised, his, eyes, to, heaven, gerty, bends, so, far, back, she, trembles, bloom, had, a, full, view, high, up, above, her, knee, where, no, one, ever, not, even, on, the, swing, or, wading, and, she,

1960s, in, a, review, in, the, dial, t, s, eliot, said, of, ulysses, i, hold, this, book, to, be, the, most, important, expression, which, the, present, age, has, found, it, is, a, book, to, which, we, are, all, indebted, and, from, which, none, of, us, can, escape, he, went, on, to, assert, that, joyce, was, not, at, fault, if, people, after, him, did, not, understand, it, the, next, generation, is, responsible, for, its, own, soul, a, man, of, genius, is, responsible, to, his, peers, not, to, a, studio, full, of, uneducated, and, undisciplined, coxcombs, ezra, pound, wrote, all, men, should, unite, to, give, praise, to, ulysses, those, who, will, not, may, content, themselves, with, a, place, in, the, lower, intellectual, orders, he, claimed, that, in, writing, ulysses, this, super, novel, joyce, surpassed, gustave, flaubert, miguel, de, cervantes, henry, james, and, marcel, proust, concluding, that, besides, fran, ois, rabelais, he, can, think, of, no, other, prose, writer, whose, proportional, status, in, pan, literature, is, not, modified, by, the, advent, of, ulysses, the, essayist, john, eglinton, wrote, of, joyce, s, method, mr, joyce, has, wished, to, devise, a, species, of, literary, notation, which, will, express, the, interuptedness, of, life, we, cannot, hold, our, minds, to, any, one, purpose, or, idea, for, more, than, a, few, moments, at, a, time, he, interprets, joyce, s, purpose, as, produc, a, work, of, virgin, art, william, carlos, williams, found, joyce, s, style, in, ulysses, richer, than, in, his, previous, works, he, called, it, a, priestly, style, and, joyce, is, himself, a, priest, joyce, discloses, the, x, ray, eyes, of, the, confessional, we, see, the, naked, soul, has, compared, up, his, reader, with, god, ulysses, has, been, called, the, most, prominent, landmark, in, modernist, literature, a, work, where, life, s, complexities, are, depicted, with, unprecedented, and, unequalled, linguistic, and, stylistic, virtuosity, that, style, has, been, called, the, finest, example, of, stream, of, consciousness, in, modern, fiction, with, joyce, going, deeper, and, farther, than, any, other, novelist, in, interior, monologue, and, stream, of, consciousness, this, technique, has, been, praised, for, its, faithful, representation, of, the, flow, of, thought, feeling, and, mental, reflection, as, well, as, shifts, of, mood, according, to, irish, scholar, declan, kiberd, before, joyce, no, writer, of, fiction, had, so, foregrounded, the, process, of, thinking, australian, scholar, s, l, goldberg, has, argued, that, interior, monologue, in, ulysses, is, rooted, in, joyce, s, epiphany, technique, for, goldberg, the, epiphany, is, the, real, artistic, and, dramatic, unit, of, joyce, s, stream, of, consciousness, writing, what, he, renders, dramatically, are, minds, engaged, in, the, apprehension, of, epiphanies, the, elements, of, meaning, apprehended, in, life, another, critic, has, identified, four, distinct, epiphany, techniques, in, joyce, s, work, noting, their, use, in, ulysses, from, the, simplest, device, such, as, the, revelation, of, gerty, macdowell, s, limp, to, the, more, complex, such, as, the, bowl, symbolism, in, telemachus, cited, as, an, example, of, joyce, s, major, epiphany, technique, quidditas, produced, directly, is, the, revelation, of, molly, bloom, as, female, essence, literary, critic, edmund, wilson, noted, that, ulysses, attempts, to, render, as, precisely, and, as, directly, as, it, is, possible, in, words, to, do, what, our, participation, in, life, is, like, or, rather, what, it, seems, to, us, like, as, from, moment, to, moment, we, live, stuart, gilbert, said, that, the, personages, of, ulysses, are, not, fictitious, but, that, these, people, are, as, they, must, be, they, act, we, see, according, to, some, lex, eterna, an, ineluctable, condition, of, their, very, existence, through, these, characters, joyce, achieves, a, coherent, and, integral, interpretation, of, life, joyce, uses, metaphors, symbols, ambiguities, and, overtones, which, gradually, link, themselves, together, so, as, to, form, a, network, of, connections, binding, the, whole, work, this, system, of, connections, gives, the, novel, a, wide, more, universal, significance, as, leopold, bloom, becomes, a, modern, ulysses, an, everyman, in, a, dublin, which, becomes, a, microcosm, of, the, world, eliot, called, this, system, the, mythic, method, a, way, of, controlling, of, ordering, of, giving, a, shape, and, a, significance, to, the, immense, panorama, of, futility, and, anarchy, which, is, contemporary, history, novelist, vladimir, nabokov, called, ulysses, a, divine, work, of, art, and, the, greatest, masterpiece, of, 20th, century, prose, and, said, that, it, towers, above, the, rest, of, joyce, s, writing, with, noble, originality, unique, lucidity, of, thought, and, style, psychology, professor, charles, fernyhough, called, ulysses, the, archetypal, stream, of, consciousness, novel, the, book, had, its, critics, largely, in, response, to, its, then, uncommon, inclusion, of, sexual, elements, the, writer, and, irish, nationalist, shane, leslie, called, ulysses, literary, bolshevism, experimental, anti, conventional, anti, christian, chaotic, totally, unmoral, the, writer, and, communist, revolutionary,

that, i, cannot, see, how, the, work, upon, which, mr, joyce, spent, seven, strenuous, years, years, of, wrestling, and, of, agony, can, ever, be, given, to, the, public, virginia, woolf, wrote, ulysses, was, a, memorable, catastrophe, immense, in, daring, terrific, in, disaster, the, newspaper, editor, james, douglas, in, the, sunday, express, said, it, contained, secret, sewers, of, vice, canalized, in, its, flood, of, unimaginable, thoughts, images, and, pornographic, words, and, revolting, blasphemies, that, debases, and, perverts, and, degrades, the, noble, gift, of, imagination, and, wit, and, lordship, of, language, writing, in, america, magazine, in, 1934, the, jesuit, francis, x, talbot, vehemently, decried, judge, woolsey, s, recent, decision, that, ulysses, was, not, obscene, adding, only, a, person, who, had, been, a, catholic, only, one, with, an, incurably, diseased, mind, could, be, so, diabolically, venomous, toward, god, toward, the, blessed, sacrament, toward, the, virgin, mary, in, his, review, in, the, outlook, the, british, novelist, arnold, bennett, expressed, his, lack, of, admiration, for, joyce, detailing, one, day, in, 700, pages, he, wrote, given, sufficient, time, paper, childish, caprice, and, obstinacy, one, might, easily, write, over, seven, thousand, pages, about, twenty, hours, of, life, bennett, also, opposed, val, ry, larbaud, s, view, that, joyce, elaborately, planned, and, organized, the, day, he, wrote, about, bennett, wrote, apparently, thinks, there, is, something, truly, artistic, and, high, minded, in, playing, the, lout, to, the, innocent, and, defenseless, reader, as, a, fact, there, isn, t, after, all, to, comprehend, ulysses, is, not, among, the, recognized, learned, professions, and, nobody, should, give, his, entire, existence, to, the, job, bennett, acknowledged, that, joyce, s, verbal, method, can, be, justified, since, he, is, trying, to, reproduce, the, thoughts, of, personage, but, called, the, details, trivial, and, perfectly, futile, in, the, narrative, ulysses, was, ranked, number, 1, in, modern, library, s, 100, best, novels, of, the, 20th, century, the, publication, history, of, ulysses, is, complex, there, have, been, at, least, 18, editions, and, variations, among, different, impressions, of, each, edition, according, to, joyce, scholar, jack, dalton, the, first, edition, of, ulysses, contained, over, 2, 000, errors, as, subsequent, editions, attempted, to, correct, these, mistakes, they, would, often, add, more, due, in, part, to, the, difficulty, of, separating, non, authorial, errors, from, joyce, s, deliberate, errors, devised, to, challenge, the, reader, notable, editions, include, hans, walter, gabler, s, 1984, edition, was, the, most, sustained, attempt, to, produce, a, corrected, text, but, it, has, received, much, criticism, most, notably, from, john, kidd, kidd, s, main, theoretical, criticism, is, of, gabler, s, choice, of, a, patchwork, of, manuscripts, as, his, copy, text, the, base, edition, with, which, the, editor, compares, each, variant, but, this, fault, stems, from, an, assumption, of, the, anglo, american, tradition, of, scholarly, editing, rather, than, the, blend, of, french, and, german, editorial, theories, that, actually, lay, behind, gabler, s, reasoning, the, choice, of, a, composite, copy, text, is, seen, to, be, problematic, in, the, eyes, of, some, american, editors, who, generally, favour, the, first, edition, of, any, particular, work, as, copy, text, less, subject, to, differing, national, editorial, theories, however, is, the, claim, that, for, hundreds, of, pages, about, half, the, episodes, of, ulysses, the, extant, manuscript, is, purported, to, be, a, fair, copy, that, joyce, made, for, sale, to, a, potential, patron, as, it, turned, out, john, quinn, the, irish, american, lawyer, and, collector, purchased, the, manuscript, diluting, this, charge, somewhat, is, the, fact, that, the, theory, of, now, lost, final, working, drafts, is, gabler, s, own, for, the, suspect, episodes, the, existing, typescript, is, the, last, witness, gabler, attempted, to, reconstruct, what, he, called, the, continuous, manuscript, text, which, had, never, physically, existed, by, adding, together, all, of, joyce, s, accretions, from, the, various, sources, this, allowed, gabler, to, produce, a, synoptic, text, indicating, the, stage, at, which, each, addition, was, inserted, kidd, and, even, some, of, gabler, s, own, advisers, believe, this, method, meant, losing, joyce, s, final, changes, in, about, two, thousand, places, far, from, being, continuous, the, manuscripts, seem, to, be, opposite, jerome, mcgann, describes, in, detail, the, editorial, principles, of, gabler, in, his, article, for, the, journal, criticism, issue, 27, 1985, in, the, wake, of, the, controversy, still, other, commentators, charged, that, gabler, s, changes, were, motivated, by, a, desire, to, secure, a, fresh, copyright, and, another, seventy, five, years, of, royalties, beyond, a, looming, expiration, date, in, june, 1988, john, kidd, published, the, scandal, of, ulysses, in, the, new, york, review, of, books, charging, that, not, only, did, gabler, s, changes, overturn, joyce, s, last, revisions, but, in, another, four, hundred, places, gabler, failed, to, follow, any, manuscript, whatever, making, nonsense, of, his, own, premises, kidd, accused, gabler, of, unnecessarily, changing, joyce, s, spelling, punctuation, use, of, accents, and, all, the, small, details, he, claimed, to, have, been, restoring, instead, gabler, was, actually, following, printed, editions, such, as, that, of, 1932, not, the, manuscripts, gabler, was, found, to, have, made, genuine, blunders, such, as, his, changing, the, name, of, the, real, life, dubliner, harry, thrift, to, shrift, and, cricketer, captain, buller, to, culler, on, the, basis, of, handwriting, irregularities, in, the, extant, manuscript, these, corrections, were, undone, by, gabler, in, 1986, kidd, stated, that, many, of, gabler, s, errors, resulted, from, gabler, s, use, of, facsimiles, rather, than, original, manuscripts, in, december, 1988, charles, rossman, s, the, new, ulysses, the, hidden, controversy, for, the, new, york, review, revealed, that, some, of, gabler, s, own, advisers, felt, too, many, changes, were, being, made, but, that, the, publishers, were, pushing, for, as, many, alterations, as, possible, then, kidd, produced, a, 174, page, critique, that, filled, an, entire, issue, of, the, papers, of, the, bibliographical, society, of, america, dated, the, same, month, this, inquiry, into, ulysses, the, corrected, text, was, published, the, next, year, in, book, format, and, on, floppy, disk, by, kidd, s, james, joyce, research, center, at, boston, university, gabler, and, others, including, michael, groden, have, rejected, kidd, s, critique, in, his, 1993, afterword, to, the, gabler, edition, groden, writes, that, kidd, s, lists, of, supposed, errors, were, constructed, with, so, little, demonstrated, understanding, of, gabler, s, theoretical, assumptions, and, procedures, that, they, can, point, to, errors, or, misjudgments, only, by, accident, the, scholarly, community, remains, divided, in, 1990, gabler, s, american, publisher, random, house, after, consulting, a, committee, of, scholars, replaced, the, gabler, edition, with, its, 1961, version, and, in, the, united, kingdom, the, bodley, head, press, revived, its, 1960, version, upon, which, random, house, s,
