detailed, the, angkor, monuments, but, lacked, drawings, of, the, angkorian, sites, france, adopted, cambodia, as, a, protectorate, on, 11, august, 1863, partly, due, to, the, artistic, legacy, of, angkor, wat, and, other, khmer, monuments, in, the, angkor, region, and, invaded, siam, this, quickly, led, to, cambodia, reclaiming, lands, in, the, northwestern, corner, of, the, country, including, siem, reap, battambang, and, sisophon, which, were, under, siamese, rule, from, 1795, to, 1907, following, excavations, at, the, site, there, were, no, ordinary, dwellings, or, houses, or, other, signs, of, settlement, such, as, cooking, utensils, weapons, or, items, of, clothing, usually, found, at, ancient, sites, in, the, 20th, century, a, considerable, effort, was, launched, to, clear, the, plant, overgrowth, and, restore, the, temple, complex, conservation, d, angkor, angkor, conservancy, was, established, by, the, cole, fran, aise, d, extr, me, orient, efeo, in, 1908, the,

undertaken, in, the, 1960s, cambodia, gained, independence, from, france, on, 9, november, 1953, and, has, controlled, angkor, wat, since, then, restoration, work, was, interrupted, by, the, cambodian, civil, war, when, the, khmer, rouge, took, control, of, the, country, during, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, work, on, angkor, was, abandoned, during, the, khmer, rouge, era, and, the, conservation, d, angkor, was, disbanded, in, 1975, camping, khmer, rouge, forces, used, whatever, wood, remained, in, the, building, structures, for, firewood, and, a, shoot, out, between, khmer, rouge, and, vietnamese, forces, caused, a, few, bullet, holes, in, bas, reliefs, in, the, late, 1980s, and, early, 1990s, far, more, damage, was, done, to, the, reliefs, by, art, thieves, working, out, of, thailand, who, lopped, off, many, sculptures, and, other, structures, including, earlier, reconstructions, as, with, most, other, ancient, temples, in, cambodia, angkor, wat, also, faced, extensive, damage, and, deterioration, by, a, combination, of, plant, overgrowth, fungi, ground, movements, war, damage, and, theft, though, the, war, damage, to, angkor, wat, s, temples, was, limited, compared, to, the, rest, of, cambodia, s, temple, ruins, between, 1986, and, 1992, the, archaeological, survey, of, india, carried, out, restoration, work, on, the, temple, as, france, did, not, recognise, the, cambodian, government, at, the, time, criticisms, have, been, raised, about, both, the, early, french, restoration, attempts, and, the, later, indian, work, with, concerns, over, the, damage, done, to, the, stone, surface, by, the, use, of, various, chemicals, and, cement, in, 1992, the, site, was, declared, as, a, unesco, world, heritage, site, simultaneously, angkor, wat, was, listed, in, unesco, s, world, heritage, in, danger, later, removed, in, 2004, following, an, appeal, for, help, by, norodom, sihanouk, together, with, an, appeal, by, unesco, to, the, international, community, to, save, angkor, zoning, of, the, area, was, designated, to, protect, the, angkor, site, in, 1994, authority, for, the, protection, and, management, of, angkor, and, the, region, of, siem, reap, apsara, was, established, in, 1995, to, protect, and, manage, the, area, and, a, law, to, protect, cambodian, heritage, was, passed, in, 1996, in, the, 21st, century, teams, from, several, countries, including, france, india, japan, and, china, are, involved, in, angkor, wat, conservation, projects, the, german, apsara, conservation, project, gacp, was, launched, to, protect, the, devatas, and, other, bas, reliefs, that, decorate, the, temple, from, further, damage, when, the, organization, s, survey, found, that, around, 20, of, the, reliefs, were, in, very, poor, condition, mainly, because, of, natural, erosion, and, deterioration, of, the, stone, but, also, in, part, also, due, to, earlier, restoration, efforts, microbial, biofilms, degraded, sandstone, at, angkor, wat, other, work, involved, the, repair, of, collapsed, sections, of, the, structure, and, prevention, of, further, collapse, for, example, the, west, facade, of, the, upper, level, was, buttressed, by, scaffolding, in, 2002, a, japanese, team, completed, the, restoration, of, the, north, library, of, the, outer, enclosure, in, 2005, replicas, have, been, made, to, replace, some, of, the, lost, or, damaged, sculptures, in, december, 2015, it, was, announced, that, a, research, team, from, the, university, of, sydney, found, a, previously, unseen, ensemble, of, buried, towers, that, were, built, and, demolished, during, the, construction, of, angkor, wat, as, well, as, a, massive, structure, with, wooden, fortifications, of, unknown, purpose, on, its, south, side, the, findings, included, evidence, of, low, density, residential, occupation, a, road, grid, ponds, and, mounds, in, the, region, these, discoveries, indicated, that, the, temple, precinct, bounded, by, a, moat, and, wall, may, not, have, been, used, exclusively, by, the, priestly, elite, as, was, previously, thought, angkor, wat, is, a, hindu, buddhist, temple, complex, located, on, a, site, measuring, 162, 6, ha, 1, 626, 000, m, 2, 402, acres, within, the, ancient, khmer, capital, city, of, angkor, it, is, considered, as, the, largest, religious, structure, in, the, world, by, guinness, world, records, angkor, wat, is, a, unique, combination, of, the, temple, mountain, the, standard, design, for, the, empire, s, state, temples, and, the, later, plan, of, concentric, galleries, most, of, which, were, originally, derived, from, religious, beliefs, of, hinduism, the, construction, of, angkor, wat, suggests, that, there, was, a, celestial, significance, with, certain, features, of, the, temple, this, is, observed, in, the, temple, s, east, west, orientation, and, lines, of, sight, from, terraces, within, the, temple, that, show, specific, towers, to, be, at, the, precise, location, of, the, solstice, at, sunrise, the, angkor, wat, temple, s, main, tower, aligns, with, the, morning, sun, of, the, spring, equinox, the, temple, is, a, representation, of, mount, meru, the, home, of, the, gods, according, to, hindu, mythology, the, central, quincunx, of, towers, symbolise, the, five, peaks, of, the, mountain, and, the, walls, and, moat, symbolise, the, surrounding, mountain, ranges, and, ocean, access, to, the, upper, areas, of, the, temple, was, progressively, more, exclusive, with, the, laity, being, admitted, only, to, the, lowest, level, unlike, most, khmer, temples, angkor, wat, is, oriented, to, the, west, rather, than, the, east, this, has, led, scholars, including, maurice, glaize, and, george, coed, s, to, hypothesize, that, suryavarman, intended, it, to, serve, as, his, funerary, temple, further, evidence, for, this, view, is, provided, by, the, bas, reliefs, which, proceed, in, a, counter, clockwise, direction, prasavya, in, hindu, terminology, as, this, is, the, reverse, of, the, normal, order, rituals, take, place, in, reverse, order, during, brahminic, funeral, services, archaeologist, charles, higham, also, describes, a, container, that, may, have, been, a, funerary, jar, that, was, recovered, from, the, central, tower, it, has, been, nominated, by, some, as, the, greatest, expenditure, of, energy, on, the, disposal, of, a, corpse, freeman, and, jacques, however, note, that, several, other, temples, of, angkor, depart, from, the, typical, eastern, orientation, and, suggest, that, angkor, wat, s, alignment, was, due, to, its, dedication, to, vishnu, who, was, associated, with, the, west, drawing, on, the, temple, s, alignment, and, dimensions, and, on, the, content, and, arrangement, of, the, bas, reliefs, researcher, eleanor, mannikka, argues, that, the, structure, represents, a, claimed, new, era, of, peace, under, king, suryavarman, ii, as, the, measurements, of, solar, and, lunar, time, cycles, were, built, into, the, sacred, space, of, angkor, wat, this, divine, mandate, to, rule, was, anchored, to, consecrated, chambers, and, corridors, meant, to, perpetuate, the, king, s, power, and, to, honour, and, placate, the, deities, manifest, in, the, heavens, above, mannikka, s, suggestions, have, been, received, with, a, mixture, of, interest, and, scepticism, in, academic, circles, she, distances, herself, from, the, speculations, of, others, such, as, graham, hancock, that, angkor, wat, is, part, of, a, representation, of, the, constellation, draco, the, oldest, surviving, plan, of, angkor, wat, dates, to, 1715, and, is, credited, to, fujiwara, tadayoshi, the, plan, is, stored, in, the, suifu, meitoku, kai, shokokan, museum, in, mito, japan, angkor, wat, is, the, prime, example, of, the, classical, style, of, khmer, architecture, the, angkor, wat, style, to, which, it, has, given, its, name, architecturally, the, elements, characteristic, of, the, style, include, the, ogival, redented, towers, shaped, like, lotus, buds, half, galleries, to, broaden, passageways, axial, galleries, connecting, enclosures, and, the, cruciform, terraces, which, appear, along, the, main, axis, of, the, temple, typical, decorative, elements, are, devatas, or, apsaras, bas, reliefs, pediments, extensive, garlands, and, narrative, scenes, the, statuary, of, angkor, wat, is, considered, conservative, being, more, static, and, less, graceful, than, earlier, work, other, elements, of, the, design, have, been, destroyed, by, looting, and, the, passage, of, time, including, gilded, stucco, on, the, towers, gilding, on, some, figures, on, the, bas, reliefs, and, wooden, ceiling, panels, and, doors, the, temple, has, drawn, praise, for, the, harmony, of, its, design, according, to, maurice, glaize, the, temple, attains, a, classic, perfection, by, the, restrained, monumentality, of, its, finely, balanced, elements, and, the, precise, arrangement, of, its, proportions, it, is, a, work, of, power, unity, and, style, architect, jacques, dumar, ay, believes, the, layout, of, angkor, wat, borrows, chinese, influence, in, its, system, of, galleries, which, join, at, right, angles, to, form, courtyards, however, the, axial, pattern, embedded, in, the, plan, of, angkor, wat, may, be, derived, from, southeast, asian, cosmology, in, combination, with, the, mandala, represented, by, the, main, temple, the, temple, complex, is, surrounded, by, an, outer, wall, 1, 024, m, 3, 360, ft, by, 802, m, 2, 631, ft, and, 4, 5, m, 15, ft, high, it, is, encircled, by, a, 30,

mi, from, north, to, south, access, to, the, temple, is, by, an, earth, bank, to, the, east, and, a, sandstone, causeway, to, the, west, the, latter, the, main, entrance, is, a, later, addition, possibly, replacing, a, wooden, bridge, there, are, gopuras, at, each, of, the, cardinal, points, with, the, western, one, being, the, largest, and, consisting, of, three, partially, ruined, towers, glaize, notes, that, this, gopura, both, hides, and, echoes, the, form, of, the, temple, proper, under, the, southern, tower, is, a, statue, known, as, ta, reach, originally, an, eight, armed, statue, of, vishnu, that, may, have, occupied, the, temple, s, central, shrine, galleries, run, between, the, towers, and, two, further, entrances, on, either, side, of, the, gopura, often, referred, to, as, elephant, gates, as, they, are, large, enough, to, admit, those, animals, these, galleries, have, square, pillars, on, the, outer, west, side, and, a, closed, wall, on, the, inner, east, side, the, ceiling, between, the, pillars, is, decorated, with, lotus, rosettes, the, west, face, of, the, wall, is, decorated, with, dancing, figures, and, the, east, face, of, the, wall, consists, of, windows, with, balusters, decorated, with, dancing, figures, animals, and, devatas, the, outer, wall, encloses, a, space, of, 203, acres, 82, ha, which, besides, the, temple, proper, was, originally, occupied, by, people, from, the, city, and, the, royal, palace, to, the, north, of, the, temple, similar, to, other, secular, buildings, of, angkor, these, were, built, of, perishable, materials, rather, than, of, stone, so, nothing, remains, of, them, except, the, outline, of, some, of, the, streets, with, most, of, the, area, now, covered, by, vegetation, a, 350, m, 1, 150, ft, causeway, connects, the, western, gopura, to, the, temple, proper, with, naga, shaped, balustrades, and, six, sets, of, steps, leading, down, to, the, outside, on, either, side, each, side, also, features, a, library, with, entrances, at, each, cardinal, point, in, front, of, the, third, set, of, stairs, from, the, entrance, and, a, pond, between, the, library, and, the, temple, itself, the, ponds, are, later, additions, to, the, design, as, is, the, cruciform, terrace, guarded, by, lions, connecting, the, causeway, to, the, central, structure, the, temple, stands, on, a, raised, terrace, within, the, walled, enclosure, it, is, made, of, three, rectangular, galleries, rising, to, a, central, tower, each, level, higher, than, the, last, the, two, inner, galleries, each, have, four, large, towers, at, their, ordinal, corners, that, is, north, west, north, east, south, east, and, south, west, surrounding, a, higher, fifth, tower, this, pattern, is, sometimes, called, a, quincunx, and, is, believed, to, represent, the, mountains, of, meru, because, the, temple, faces, west, the, features, are, set, back, towards, the, east, leaving, more, space, to, be, filled, in, each, enclosure, and, gallery, on, the, west, side, for, the, same, reason, the, west, facing, steps, are, shallower, than, those, on, the, other, sides, mannikka, interprets, the, galleries, as, being, dedicated, to, the, king,

the, millions, of, visitors, it, attracts, the, angkor, wat, has, become, a, prominent, image, that, is, associated, with, cambodia, and, in, this, way, has, become, a, symbol, of, cambodia, itself,

however, the, temple, of, angkor, wat, did, not, become, a, symbol, of, national, pride, by, itself, but, had, been, inscribed, into, a, larger, politico, cultural, process, of, french, colonial, heritage, productions, angkor, wat, caught, the, attention, and, imagination, of, a, wider, audience, in, europe, when, the, pavilion, of, french, protectorate, of, cambodia, as, part, of, french,

khmer, king, preah, ket, mealea, by, hindu, god, preah, pisnukar, or, bra, bis, uk, r, vishvakarman, in, the, 17th, century, the, japanese, believed, that, the, temple, was, the, location, of, the,

benefit, economically, while, also, incorporating, the, richness, of, cambodian, culture, in, 2001, this, incentive, resulted, in, the, concept, of, the, angkor, tourist, city, which, would, be, developed, about, traditional, khmer, architecture, contain, leisure, and, tourist, facilities, and, provide, luxurious, hotels, capable, of, accommodating, large, numbers, of, tourists, the, prospect, of, developing, such, large, tourist, accommodations, has, encountered, concerns, from, both, apsara, and, the, icc, claiming, that, previous, tourism, developments, in, the, area, have, neglected, construction, regulations, and, that, more, of, these, projects, have, the, potential, to, damage, landscape, features, also, the, large, scale, of, these, projects, have, begun, to, threaten, the, quality, of, the, nearby, town, s, water, sewage, and, electricity, systems, it, has, also, been, noted, that, such, high, frequency, of, tourism, and, growing, demand, for,

also, voiced, concern, that, the, atmosphere, of, their, town, have, been, compromised, to, entertain, tourism, since, this, local, atmosphere, is, the, key, component, to, projects, like, angkor,
