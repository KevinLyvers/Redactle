the, terracotta, army, is, a, collection, of, terracotta, sculptures, depicting, the, armies, of, qin, shi, huang, the, first, emperor, of, china, it, is, a, form, of, funerary, art, buried, with, the, emperor, in, 210, 209, bce, with, the, purpose, of, protecting, him, in, his, afterlife, the, figures, dating, from, approximately, the, late, 200s, bce, were, discovered, in, 1974, by, local, farmers, in, lintong, county, outside, xi, an, shaanxi, china, the, figures, vary, in, height, according, to, their, rank, the, tallest, being, the, generals, the, figures, include, warriors, chariots, and, horses, estimates, from, 2007, were, that, the, three, pits, containing, the, terracotta, army, hold, more, than, 8, 000, soldiers, 130, chariots, with, 520, horses, and, 150, cavalry, horses, the, majority, of, which, remain, in, situ, in, the, pits, near, qin, shi, huang, s, mausoleum, other, non, military, terracotta, figures, have, since, been, found, in, other, pits, including, those, of, officials, acrobats, strongmen, and, musicians, the, construction, of, the, tomb, was, described, by, the, historian, sima, qian, 145, 90, bce, in, the, records, of, the, grand, historian, the, first, of, china, s, 24, dynastic, histories, which, was, written, a, century, after, the, mausoleum, s, completion, work, on, the, mausoleum, began, in, 246, bce, soon, after, emperor, qin, then, aged, 13, succeeded, his, father, as, king, of, qin, and, the, project, eventually, involved, 700, 000, conscripted, workers, geographer, li, daoyuan, writing, six, centuries, after, the, first, emperor, s, death, recorded, in, shui, jing, zhu, that, mount, li, was, a, favoured, location, due, to, its, auspicious, geology, famed, for, its, jade, mines, its, northern, side, was, rich, in, gold, and, its, southern, side, rich, in, beautiful, jade, the, first, emperor, covetous, of, its, fine, reputation, therefore, chose, to, be, buried, there, sima, qian, wrote, that, the, first, emperor, was, buried, with, palaces, towers, officials, valuable, artifacts, and, wondrous, objects, according, to, this, famous, account, 100, flowing, rivers, were, simulated, using, mercury, and, above, them, the, ceiling, was, decorated, with, heavenly, bodies, below, which, lay, the, features, of, the, lands, of, china, which, the, emperor, had, unified, some, translations, of, this, passage, refer, to, models, or, imitations, however, those, words, were, not, used, in, the, original, text, which, also, makes, no, mention, of, the, terracotta, army, although, these, elements, of, sima, qian, s, account, on, the, structure, of, the, mausoleum, have, been, seen, as, credulous, in, pre, modern, assessments, the, detection, of, high, levels, of, mercury, that, were, found, in, the, soil, of, the, tomb, mound, following, the, discovery, of, the, mausoleum, site, have, since, given, credence, to, sima, qian, s, account, additionally, the, emperor, is, well, documented, for, building, monumental, statues, in, human, form, during, his, reign, such, as, the, twelve, metal, colossi, which, were, a, series, of, contemporaneous, statues, that, are, now, lost, but, have, been, noted, in, historical, records, later, historical, accounts, have, suggested, that, the, mausoleum, complex, and, tomb, itself, had, been, looted, by, xiang, yu, a, contender, for, the, throne, after, the, death, of, the, first, emperor, however, there, are, indications, that, the, tomb, itself, may, not, have, been, plundered, the, terracotta, army, was, discovered, on, 29, march, 1974, by, a, group, of, farmers, yang, zhifa, his, five, brothers, and, neighbour, wang, puzhi, who, were, digging, a, well, approximately, 1, 5, km, 0, 93, mi, east, of, the, qin, emperor, s, tomb, mound, at, mount, li, lishan, a, region, riddled, with, underground, springs, and, watercourses, for, centuries, occasional, reports, mentioned, pieces, of, terracotta, figures, and, fragments, of, the, qin, necropolis, roofing, tiles, bricks, and, chunks, of, masonry, this, discovery, prompted, chinese, archaeologists, including, zhao, kangmin, to, investigate, revealing, the, largest, pottery, figurine, group, ever, found, a, museum, complex, has, since, been, constructed, over, the, area, the, largest, pit, being, enclosed, by, a, roofed, structure, the, terracotta, army, is, part, of, a, much, larger, necropolis, ground, penetrating, radar, and, core, sampling, have, measured, the, area, to, be, approximately, 98, square, kilometers, 38, square, miles, the, necropolis, was, constructed, as, a, microcosm, of, the, emperor, s, imperial, palace, or, compound, and, covers, a, large, area, around, the, tomb, mound, of, the, first, emperor, the, earthen, tomb, mound, is, located, at, the, foot, of, mount, li, and, built, in, a, pyramidal, shape, and, is, surrounded, by, two, solidly, built, rammed, earth, walls, with, gateway, entrances, the, necropolis, consists, of, several, offices, halls, stables, other, structures, as, well, as, an, imperial, park, placed, around, the, tomb, mound, the, warriors, stand, guard, to, the, east, of, the, tomb, up, to, 5, m, 16, ft, of, reddish, sandy, soil, had, accumulated, over, the, site, in, the, two, millennia, following, its, construction, but, archaeologists, found, evidence, of, earlier, disturbances, at, the, site, during, the, excavations, near, the, mount, li, burial, mound, archaeologists, found, several, graves, dating, from, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, where, diggers, had, apparently, struck, terracotta, fragments, these, were, discarded, as, worthless, and, used, along, with, soil, to, backfill, the, excavations, the, tomb, appears, to, be, a, hermetically, sealed, space, approximately, 100, by, 75, metres, 328, ft, 246, ft, the, tomb, remains, unopened, possibly, due, to, concerns, over, preservation, of, its, artifacts, for, example, after, the, excavation, of, the, terracotta, army, the, painted, surface, present, on, some, terracotta, figures, began, to, flake, and, fade, the, lacquer, covering, the, paint, can, curl, in, fifteen, seconds, once, exposed, to, xi, an, s, dry, air, and, can, flake, off, in, just, four, minutes, four, main, pits, approximately, 7, m, 23, ft, deep, have, since, been, uncovered, in, the, site, excavations, these, are, located, approximately, 1, 5, km, 0, 93, mi, east, of, the, burial, mound, the, soldiers, within, were, laid, out, as, if, to, protect, the, tomb, from, the, east, where, the, qin, emperor, s, conquered, states, lay, and, were, discovered, 7, m, below, the, excavation, level, pit, 1, which, is, 230, m, 750, ft, long, and, 62, m, 203, ft, wide, contains, the, main, army, of, more, than, 3, 000, figures, it, is, the, largest, of, the, four, pits, and, has, eleven, parallel, corridors, most, more, than, 3, m, 10, ft, wide, and, paved, with, small, bricks, with, a, wooden, ceiling, supported, by, large, beams, and, posts, this, design, was, also, used, for, the, tombs, of, nobles, and, would, have, resembled, palace, hallways, when, built, the, wooden, ceilings, were, covered, with, reed, mats, and, layers, of, clay, for, waterproofing, and, then, mounded, with, more, soil, raising, them, about, 2, to, 3, m, 6, ft, 7, in, to, 9, ft, 10, in, above, the, surrounding, ground, level, when, completed, pit, 2, has, cavalry, and, infantry, units, as, well, as, war, chariots, and, is, thought, to, represent, a, military, guard, pit, 3, is, the, command, post, with, high, ranking, officers, and, a, war, chariot, pit, 4, is, empty, perhaps, left, unfinished, by, its, builders, some, of, the, figures, in, pits, 1, and, 2, show, fire, damage, while, remains, of, burnt, ceiling, rafters, have, also, been, found, these, together, with, the, missing, weapons, have, been, taken, as, evidence, of, the, reported, looting, by, xiang, yu, and, the, subsequent, burning, of, the, site, which, is, thought, to, have, caused, the, roof, to, collapse, and, crush, the, army, figures, below, the, terracotta, figures, currently, on, display, have, been, restored, from, the, fragments, other, pits, that, formed, the, necropolis, have, also, been, excavated, these, pits, lie, within, and, outside, the, walls, surrounding, the, tomb, mound, they, variously, contain, bronze, carriages, terracotta, figures, of, entertainers, such, as, acrobats, and, strongmen, officials, stone, armour, suits, burial, sites, of, horses, rare, animals, and, labourers, as, well, as, bronze, cranes, and, ducks, set, in, an, underground, park, the, terracotta, figures, are, life, sized, typically, ranging, from, 175, cm, 5, 74, ft, to, about, 200, cm, 6, 6, ft, the, officers, are, typically, taller, they, vary, in, height, uniform, and, hairstyle, in, accordance, with, their, portrayed, rank, their, faces, appear, to, be, different, for, each, individual, figure, scholars, have, identified, 10, base, facial, forms, which, were, then, further, developed, to, give, each, figure, individuality, in, terms, of, facial, morphology, the, figures, are, of, these, general, types, armored, infantry, unarmored, infantry, cavalrymen, who, wear, a, pillbox, hat, helmeted, drivers, of, chariots, with, more, armor, protection, spear, carrying, charioteers, kneeling, crossbowmen, or, archers, who, are, armored, standing, archers, who, are, not, as, well, as, generals, and, other, lower, ranking, officers, there, are, however, many, variations, in, the, uniforms, within, the, ranks, for, example, some, may, wear, shin, pads, while, others, not, they, may, wear, either, long, or, short, trousers, some, of, which, may, be, padded, and, their, body, armors, vary, depending, on, rank, function, and, position, in, formation, there, are, also, terracotta, horses, placed, among, the, warrior, figures, originally, the, figures, were, painted, with, ground, precious, stones, intensely, fired, bones, white, pigments, of, iron, oxide, dark, red, cinnabar, red, malachite, green, azurite, blue, charcoal, black, cinnabar, barium, copper, silicate, mix, chinese, purple, or, han, purple, tree, sap, from, a, nearby, source, more, than, likely, from, the, chinese, lacquer, tree, brown, and, other, colors, including, pink, lilac, red, white, and, one, unidentified, color, the, colored, lacquer, finish, and, individual, facial, features, would, have, given, the, figures, a, realistic, feel, with, eyebrows, and, facial, hair, in, black, and, the, faces, done, in, pink, however, in, xi, an, s, dry, climate, much, of, the, color, coating, would, flake, off, in, less, than, four, minutes, after, removing, the, mud, surrounding, the, army, excavations, in, pit, k9901, have, uncovered, in, 1999, a, series, of, associated, terracotta, sculptures, that, have, been, dubbed, the, acrobats, which, have, been, remarked, to, display, an, advanced, understanding, of, human, anatomy, the, original, function, of, these, statues, remains, unclear, but, they, have, been, described, as, either, potentially, acrobat, or, dancer, figures, the, number, of, these, figures, uncovered, thus, far, are, relatively, few, compared, to, the, more, noted, warrior, figures, with, the, total, discovered, probably, numbering, a, dozen, the, figures, are, bare, with, the, exception, of, a, loincloth, as, dress, these, figures, are, very, vivid, and, less, stereotypical, than, the, soldiers, especially, through, the, dynamic, treatment, of, the, musculature, and, bone, joints, some, of, the, men, are, very, lean, while, others, have, massive, bodies, several, of, them, are, shown, in, the, process, of, moving, or, making, gestures, these, terracotta, statues, demonstrate, an, advanced, mastery, of, the, depiction, of, the, shapes, and, proportions, of, the, human, body, eleven, of, such, figurines, from, pit, k9901, have, since, been, subsequently, unearthed, with, seven, of, them, found, in, a, degree, of, preservation, that, made, them, capable, of, being, largely, reconstructed, from, their, fragment, shards, since, the, time, of, their, discovery, the, figures, have, been, noted, for, their, exceptional, stylistic, realism, and, individualism, with, assessments, having, found, that, no, two, figures, share, the, exact, same, features, the, earliest, note, on, this, aspect, was, that, of, 20th, century, art, historian, german, hafner, who, in, 1986, was, the, first, to, speculate, on, a, possible, hellenistic, link, to, these, sculptures, due, to, the, unusual, display, of, naturalism, relative, to, general, qin, era, sculpture, the, art, of, the, terracotta, army, originated, from, western, contact, this, idea, was, also, generally, supported, by, duan, qingbo, site, chief, archaeologist, from, 1998, to, 2006, though, noting, that, the, only, thing, in, extant, archaeology, which, may, hold, a, close, similarity, to, the, figures, in, terms, of, their, artistic, style, is, that, of, the, later, 1st, century, bce, central, asian, khalchayan, statuary, li, xiuzhen, senior, site, archaeologist, also, acknowledged, the, possibility, of, hellenistic, influences, stating, we, now, think, the, terracotta, army, the, acrobats, and, the, bronze, sculptures, found, on, site, were, inspired, by, ancient, greek, sculptures, and, art, she, later, also, asserted, ultimate, chinese, authorship, the, terracotta, warriors, may, be, inspired, by, western, culture, but, were, uniquely, made, by, the, chinese, others, have, argued, that, such, speculations, rest, on, flawed, and, old, eurocentric, ideas, that, assumed, other, civilizations, were, incapable, of, sophisticated, artistry, and, thus, foreign, artistry, must, be, seen, through, western, traditions, with, site, archaeologist, zhang, weixing, stating, that, there, is, no, substantial, evidence, at, all, for, any, such, linkage, raoul, mclaughlin, an, independent, researcher, on, roman, trade, stated, that, there, is, no, greek, influence, on, the, terracotta, army, and, emphasized, the, differences, in, artisanship, construction, material, and, symbology, darryl, wilkinson, of, dartmouth, college, has, instead, argued, that, the, qin, era, display, of, sculptural, naturalism, alongside, that, of, the, pre, columbian, moche, culture, in, peru, indicate, that, the, greeks, did, not, invent, naturalism, and, that, sculptural, naturalism, is, not, the, product, of, any, one, culture, s, civilizational, genius, the, terracotta, army, figures, were, manufactured, in, workshops, by, government, laborers, and, local, craftsmen, using, local, materials, heads, arms, legs, and, torsos, were, created, separately, and, then, assembled, by, luting, the, pieces, together, when, completed, the, terracotta, figures, were, placed, in, the, pits, in, precise, military, formation, according, to, rank, and, duty, in, 2021, morphological, studies, have, shown, that, there, is, a, strong, resemblance, between, the, statues, and, that, of, the, local, region, s, modern, inhabitants, which, has, led, some, scholars, to, theorize, that, the, high, level, of, stylistic, realism, stems, from, the, figures, being, modelled, on, actual, soldiers, the, faces, were, created, using, molds, and, at, least, ten, face, molds, may, have, been, used, clay, was, then, added, after, assembly, to, provide, individual, facial, features, to, make, each, figure, appear, different, it, is, believed, that, the, warriors, legs, were, made, in, much, the, same, way, that, terracotta, drainage, pipes, were, manufactured, at, the, time, this, would, classify, the, process, as, assembly, line, production, with, specific, parts, manufactured, and, assembled, after, being, fired, as, opposed, to, crafting, a, figure, as, one, solid, piece, and, subsequently, firing, it, in, those, times, of, tight, imperial, control, each, workshop, was, required, to, inscribe, its, name, on, items, produced, to, ensure, quality, control, this, has, aided, modern, historians, in, verifying, which, workshops, were, commandeered, to, make, tiles, and, other, mundane, items, for, the, terracotta, army, a, grave, pit, was, discovered, and, excavated, in, 2003, with, 121, skeletons, retrieved, which, has, been, identified, by, scholars, to, be, attributable, to, the, site, workers, the, individuals, have, been, assessed, to, be, predominantly, from, the, age, range, of, 15, to, 40, years, old, with, an, average, height, of, around, 1, 7, meters, many, studies, have, concentrated, on, analyzing, these, workers, including, craniometric, as, well, as, genetic, studies, which, were, conducted, to, try, to, understand, the, workers, origins, according, to, duan, qingbo, lead, archaeologist, and, director, of, excavations, at, the, mausoleum, from, 1998, to, 2006, dna, analysis, work, on, a, group, of, 19, skeletons, in, comparison, with, 33, contemporary, chinese, individuals, showed, that, the, workers, and, laborers, analyzed, exhibited, a, diverse, range, of, ethnicities, traceable, to, that, of, both, han, and, minority, ethnicities, with, a, particular, concentration, of, individuals, from, southern, china, most, of, the, figures, originally, held, real, weapons, which, would, have, increased, their, realism, the, majority, of, these, weapons, were, looted, shortly, after, the, creation, of, the, army, or, have, rotted, away, despite, this, over, 40, 000, bronze, items, of, weaponry, have, been, recovered, including, swords, daggers, spears, lances, battle, axes, scimitars, shields, crossbows, and, crossbow, triggers, most, of, the, recovered, items, are, arrowheads, which, are, usually, found, in, bundles, of, 100, units, studies, of, these, arrowheads, suggest, that, they, were, produced, by, self, sufficient, autonomous, workshops, using, a, process, referred, to, as, cellular, production, or, toyotism, some, weapons, were, coated, with, a, 10, 15, micrometer, layer, of, chromium, dioxide, before, burial, that, was, believed, to, have, protected, them, from, any, form, of, decay, for, the, last, 2200, years, however, research, in, 2019, indicated, that, the, chromium, was, merely, contamination, from, nearby, lacquer, not, a, means, of, protecting, the, weapons, the, slightly, alkaline, ph, and, small, particle, size, of, the, burial, soil, most, likely, preserved, the, weapons, the, swords, contain, an, alloy, of, copper, tin, and, other, elements, including, nickel, magnesium, and, cobalt, some, carry, inscriptions, that, date, their, manufacture, to, between, 245, and, 228, bce, indicating, that, they, were, used, before, burial, only, very, few, figurines, are, known, from, before, the, time, of, the, terracotta, army, so, that, the, humanistic, and, animalistic, style, may, have, appeared, dramatically, new, to, their, contemporaries, in, extant, archaeology, only, rare, and, very, small, terracotta, warrior, figurines, are, known, from, the, end, of, the, zhou, dynasty, in, 4th, 3rd, century, bce, such, as, the, taerpo, horserider, the, first, known, representation, of, a, cavalryman, in, china, from, a, military, tomb, in, the, taerpo, cemetery, near, xianyang, qin, state, of, the, warring, states, period, the, rider, wears, central, asian, scythian, style, clothing, and, his, high, pointed, nose, suggests, he, is, a, foreigner, but, these, early, statuettes, have, been, argued, to, lack, the, naturalistic, and, realistic, quality, of, the, qin, terracota, army, the, terracotta, army, left, a, legacy, however, as, funeral, terracotta, armies, are, known, from, later, dynasties, although, in, a, less, stern, and, militaristic, style, and, with, much, smaller, statuettes, such, as, the, western, han, yangjiawan, terracotta, army, 195, bce, or, yangling, terracotta, army, 141, bce, the, human, sized, monumental, style, of, the, qin, emperor, has, thus, been, observed, by, scholars, to, be, a, relatively, short, lived, artistic, phase, which, would, not, reappear, until, the, 4, 6th, centuries, ce, with, the, onset, of, monumental, buddhist, sculpture, in, china, in, 2007, scientists, at, stanford, university, and, the, advanced, light, source, facility, in, berkeley, california, reported, that, powder, diffraction, experiments, combined, with, energy, dispersive, x, ray, spectroscopy, and, micro, x, ray, fluorescence, analysis, showed, that, the, process, of, producing, terracotta, figures, colored, with, chinese, purple, dye, consisting, of, barium, copper, silicate, was, derived, from, the, knowledge, gained, by, taoist, alchemists, in, their, attempts, to, synthesize, jade, ornaments, since, 2006, an, international, team, of, researchers, at, the, ucl, institute, of, archaeology, have, been, using, analytical, chemistry, techniques, to, uncover, more, details, about, the, production, techniques, employed, in, the, creation, of, the, terracotta, army, using, x, ray, fluorescence, spectrometry, of, 40, 000, bronze, arrowheads, bundled, in, groups, of, 100, the, researchers, reported, that, the, arrowheads, within, a, single, bundle, formed, a, relatively, tight, cluster, that, was, different, from, other, bundles, in, addition, the, presence, or, absence, of, metallic, impurities, was, consistent, within, bundles, based, on, the, arrows, chemical, compositions, the, researchers, concluded, that, a, cellular, manufacturing, system, similar, to, the, one, used, in, a, modern, toyota, factory, as, opposed, to, a, continuous, assembly, line, in, the, early, days, of, the, automobile, industry, was, employed, grinding, and, polishing, marks, visible, under, a, scanning, electron, microscope, have, provided, evidence, for, the, earliest, industrial, use, of, lathes, for, polishing, the, first, exhibition, of, the, figures, outside, of, china, was, held, at, the, national, gallery, of, victoria, ngv, in, melbourne, australia, in, 1982, a, collection, of, 120, objects, from, the, mausoleum, and, 12, terracotta, warriors, were, displayed, at, the, british, museum, in, london, as, its, special, exhibition, the, first, emperor, china, s, terracotta, army, from, 13, september, 2007, to, april, 2008, this, exhibition, made, 2008, the, british, museum, s, most, successful, year, and, made, the, british, museum, the, united, kingdom, s, top, cultural, attraction, between, 2007, and, 2008, the, exhibition, brought, the, most, visitors, to, the, museum, since, the, king, tutankhamun, exhibition, in, 1972, it, was, reported, that, the, 400, 000, advance, tickets, sold, out, so, fast, that, the, museum, extended, its, opening, hours, until, midnight, according, to, the, times, many, people, had, to, be, turned, away, despite, the, extended, hours, during, the, day, of, events, to, mark, the, chinese, new, year, the, crush, was, so, intense, that, the, gates, to, the, museum, had, to, be, shut, the, terracotta, army, has, been, described, as, the, only, other, set, of, historic, artifacts, along, with, the, remnants, of, the, wreck, of, the, rms, titanic, that, can, draw, a, crowd, by, the, name, alone, warriors, and, other, artifacts, were, exhibited, to, the, public, at, the, forum, de, barcelona, in, barcelona, between, 9, may, and,
