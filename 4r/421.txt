swan, lake, russian, romanized, lebed, noje, zero, ipa, listen, op, 20, is, a, ballet, composed, by, russian, composer, pyotr, ilyich, tchaikovsky, in, 1875, 76, despite, its, initial, failure, it, is, now, one, of, the, most, popular, of, all, ballets, the, scenario, initially, in, two, acts, was, fashioned, from, russian, and, german, folk, tales, and, tells, the, story, of, odette, a, princess, turned, into, a, swan, by, an, evil, sorcerer, s, curse, the, choreographer, of, the, original, production, was, julius, reisinger, v, clav, reisinger, the, ballet, was, premiered, by, the, bolshoi, ballet, on, 4, march, 1877, at, the, bolshoi, theatre, in, moscow, although, it, is, presented, in, many, different, versions, most, ballet, companies, base, their, stagings, both, choreographically, and, musically, on, the, 1895, revival, of, marius, petipa, and, lev, ivanov, first, staged, for, the, imperial, ballet, on, 15, january, 1895, at, the, mariinsky, theatre, in, st, petersburg, for, this, revival, tchaikovsky, s, score, was, revised, by, the, st, petersburg, imperial, theatre, s, chief, conductor, and, composer, riccardo, drigo, there, is, no, evidence, to, prove, who, wrote, the, original, libretto, or, where, the, idea, for, the, plot, came, from, russian, and, german, folk, tales, have, been, proposed, as, possible, sources, including, the, stolen, veil, by, johann, karl, august, mus, us, but, both, those, tales, differ, significantly, from, the, ballet, one, theory, is, that, the, original, choreographer, julius, reisinger, who, was, a, bohemian, and, therefore, likely, to, be, familiar, with, the, stolen, veil, created, the, story, another, theory, is, that, it, was, written, by, vladimir, petrovich, begichev, director, of, the, moscow, imperial, theatres, at, the, time, possibly, with, vasily, geltser, danseur, of, the, moscow, imperial, bolshoi, theatre, a, surviving, copy, of, the, libretto, bears, his, name, since, the, first, published, libretto, does, not, correspond, with, tchaikovsky, s, music, in, many, places, one, theory, is, that, the, first, published, version, was, written, by, a, journalist, after, viewing, initial, rehearsals, new, opera, and, ballet, productions, were, always, reported, in, the, newspapers, along, with, their, respective, scenarios, some, contemporaries, of, tchaikovsky, recalled, the, composer, taking, great, interest, in, the, life, story, of, bavarian, king, ludwig, ii, whose, life, had, supposedly, been, marked, by, the, sign, of, swan, and, could, have, been, the, prototype, of, the, dreamer, prince, siegfried, begichev, commissioned, the, score, of, swan, lake, from, tchaikovsky, in, may, 1875, for, 800, rubles, tchaikovsky, worked, with, only, a, basic, outline, from, julius, reisinger, of, the, requirements, for, each, dance, unlike, the, instructions, for, the, scores, of, the, sleeping, beauty, and, the, nutcracker, none, of, the, original, written, instruction, was, thought, to, have, survived, most, of, what, scholars, knew, about, information, such, as, choreography, came, from, gossip, and, reviews, of, the, performance, however, rehearsal, notes, dating, as, early, as, 1876, have, been, recently, discovered, in, the, institute, for, art, studies, in, moscow, revealing, more, information, about, what, the, original, 1877, production, may, have, looked, like, from, around, the, time, of, the, turn, of, the, 19th, century, until, the, beginning, of, the, 1890s, scores, for, ballets, were, almost, always, written, by, composers, known, as, specialists, who, were, highly, skilled, at, scoring, the, light, decorative, melodious, and, rhythmically, clear, music, that, was, at, that, time, in, vogue, for, ballet, tchaikovsky, studied, the, music, of, specialists, such, as, the, italian, cesare, pugni, and, the, austrian, ludwig, minkus, before, setting, to, work, on, swan, lake, tchaikovsky, had, a, rather, negative, opinion, of, the, specialist, ballet, music, until, he, studied, it, in, detail, being, impressed, by, the, nearly, limitless, variety, of, infectious, melodies, their, scores, contained, tchaikovsky, most, admired, the, ballet, music, of, such, composers, as, l, o, delibes, adolphe, adam, and, later, riccardo, drigo, he, would, later, write, to, his, prot, g, the, composer, sergei, taneyev, i, listened, to, the, delibes, ballet, sylvia, what, charm, what, elegance, what, wealth, of, melody, rhythm, and, harmony, i, was, ashamed, for, if, i, had, known, of, this, music, then, i, would, not, have, written, swan, lake, tchaikovsky, most, admired, adam, s, 1844, score, for, giselle, which, used, the, leitmotif, technique, associating, certain, themes, with, certain, characters, or, moods, a, technique, he, would, use, in, swan, lake, and, later, the, sleeping, beauty, tchaikovsky, drew, on, previous, compositions, for, his, swan, lake, score, according, to, two, of, tchaikovsky, s, relatives, his, nephew, yuri, lvovich, davydov, and, his, niece, anna, meck, davydova, the, composer, had, earlier, created, a, little, ballet, called, the, lake, of, the, swans, at, their, home, in, 1871, this, ballet, included, the, famous, leitmotif, the, swan, s, theme, or, song, of, the, swans, he, also, made, use, of, material, from, the, voyevoda, an, opera, he, had, abandoned, in, 1868, another, number, which, included, a, theme, from, the, voyevoda, was, the, entr, acte, of, the, fourth, scene, and, the, opening, of, the, finale, act, iv, no, 29, the, grand, adage, a, k, a, the, love, duet, from, the, second, scene, of, swan, lake, was, fashioned, from, the, final, love, duet, from, his, opera, undina, abandoned, in, 1873, by, april, 1876, the, score, was, complete, and, rehearsals, began, soon, reisinger, began, setting, certain, numbers, aside, that, he, dubbed, undanceable, reisinger, even, began, choreographing, dances, to, other, composers, music, but, tchaikovsky, protested, and, his, pieces, were, reinstated, although, the, two, artists, were, required, to, collaborate, each, seemed, to, prefer, working, as, independently, of, the, other, as, possible, at, times, tchaikovsky, actually, ended, up, turning, to, alina, bryullova, a, family, acquaintance, for, advice, on, how, he, should, write, music, for, ballet, she, later, recalled, that, due, to, her, lack, of, expertise, she, could, give, him, practically, no, advice, tchaikovsky, s, excitement, with, swan, lake, is, evident, from, the, speed, with, which, he, composed, commissioned, in, the, spring, of, 1875, the, piece, was, created, within, one, year, his, letters, to, sergei, taneyev, from, august, 1875, indicate, however, that, it, was, not, only, his, excitement, that, compelled, him, to, create, it, so, quickly, but, his, wish, to, finish, it, as, soon, as, possible, so, as, to, allow, him, to, start, on, an, opera, respectively, he, created, scores, of, the, first, three, numbers, of, the, ballet, then, the, orchestration, in, the, fall, and, winter, and, was, still, struggling, with, the, instrumentation, in, the, spring, by, april, 1876, the, work, was, complete, tchaikovsky, s, mention, of, a, draft, suggests, the, presence, of, some, sort, of, abstract, but, no, such, draft, has, ever, been, seen, tchaikovsky, wrote, various, letters, to, friends, expressing, his, longstanding, desire, to, work, with, this, type, of, music, and, his, excitement, concerning, his, current, stimulating, albeit, laborious, task, moscow, premi, re, world, premi, re, st, petersburg, premi, re, other, notable, productions, original, interpreters, the, premi, re, on, 4, march, 1877, was, given, as, a, benefit, performance, for, the, ballerina, pelageya, karpakova, also, known, as, polina, karpakova, who, performed, the, role, of, odette, with, premi, re, danseur, victor, gillert, as, prince, siegfried, karpakova, may, also, have, danced, the, part, odile, although, it, is, believed, the, ballet, originally, called, for, two, different, dancers, it, is, now, common, practice, for, the, same, ballerina, to, dance, both, odette, and, odile, the, russian, ballerina, anna, sobeshchanskaya, was, originally, cast, as, odette, but, was, replaced, when, a, governing, official, in, moscow, complained, about, her, claiming, she, had, accepted, jewelry, from, him, only, to, then, marry, a, fellow, danseur, and, sell, the, pieces, for, cash, the, premi, re, was, not, well, received, though, there, were, a, few, critics, who, recognised, the, virtues, of, the, score, most, considered, it, to, be, far, too, complicated, for, ballet, it, was, labelled, too, noisy, too, wagnerian, and, too, symphonic, the, critics, also, thought, reisinger, s, choreography, was, unimaginative, and, altogether, unmemorable, the, german, origins, of, the, story, were, treated, with, suspicion, while, the, tale, itself, was, regarded, as, stupid, with, unpronounceable, surnames, for, its, characters, karpakova, was, a, secondary, soloist, and, not, particularly, convincing, the, poverty, of, the, production, meaning, the, d, cor, and, costumes, the, absence, of, outstanding, performers, the, balletmaster, s, weakness, of, imagination, and, finally, the, orchestra, all, of, this, together, permitted, tchaikovsky, with, good, reason, to, cast, the, blame, for, the, failure, on, others, yet, the, fact, remains, and, is, too, often, omitted, in, accounts, of, this, initial, production, that, this, staging, survived, for, six, years, with, a, total, of, 41, performances, many, more, than, several, other, ballets, from, the, repertoire, of, this, theatre, on, 26, april, 1877, anna, sobeshchanskaya, made, her, d, but, as, odette, odile, in, swan, lake, and, from, the, start, she, was, completely, dissatisfied, with, the, ballet, sobeshchanskaya, asked, marius, petipa, premier, ma, tre, de, ballet, of, the, st, petersburg, imperial, theatres, to, choreograph, a, pas, de, deux, to, replace, the, pas, de, six, in, the, third, act, for, a, ballerina, to, request, a, supplemental, pas, or, variation, was, standard, practice, in, 19th, century, ballet, and, often, these, custom, made, dances, were, the, legal, property, of, the, ballerina, they, were, composed, for, petipa, created, the, pas, de, deux, to, music, by, ludwig, minkus, ballet, composer, to, the, st, petersburg, imperial, theatres, the, piece, was, a, standard, pas, de, deux, classique, consisting, of, a, short, entr, e, the, grand, adage, a, variation, for, each, dancer, individually, and, a, coda, tchaikovsky, was, angered, by, this, change, stating, that, whether, the, ballet, was, good, or, bad, he, alone, should, be, held, responsible, for, its, music, he, agreed, to, compose, a, new, pas, de, deux, but, soon, a, problem, arose, sobeshchanskaya, wanted, to, retain, petipa, s, choreography, tchaikovsky, agreed, to, compose, a, pas, de, deux, that, would, match, to, such, a, degree, the, ballerina, would, not, even, be, required, to, rehearse, sobeshchanskaya, was, so, pleased, with, tchaikovsky, s, new, music, she, requested, he, compose, an, additional, variation, which, he, did, until, 1953, this, pas, de, deux, was, thought, to, be, lost, until, a, rep, titeur, score, was, accidentally, found, in, the, archives, of, the, moscow, bolshoi, theatre, among, orchestral, parts, for, alexander, gorsky, s, revival, of, le, corsaire, gorsky, had, included, the, piece, in, his, version, of, le, corsaire, staged, in, 1912, in, 1960, george, balanchine, choreographed, a, pas, de, deux, to, this, music, for, violette, verdy, and, conrad, ludlow, performed, at, the, city, center, of, music, and, drama, in, new, york, city, as, tschaikovsky, pas, de, deux, as, it, is, still, known, and, performed, today, julius, reisinger, s, successor, as, balletmaster, was, joseph, peter, hansen, hansen, made, considerable, efforts, to, salvage, swan, lake, and, on, 13, january, 1880, he, presented, a, new, production, of, the, ballet, for, his, own, benefit, performance, the, part, of, odette, odile, was, danced, by, evdokia, kalmykova, a, student, of, the, moscow, imperial, ballet, school, with, alfred, bekefi, as, prince, siegfried, this, production, was, better, received, than, the, original, but, by, no, means, a, great, success, hansen, presented, another, version, of, swan, lake, on, 28, october, 1882, again, with, kalmykova, as, odette, odile, for, this, production, hansen, arranged, a, grand, pas, for, the, ballroom, scene, which, he, titled, la, cosmopolitana, this, was, taken, from, the, european, section, of, the, grand, pas, d, action, known, as, the, allegory, of, the, continents, from, marius, petipa, s, 1875, ballet, the, bandits, to, the, music, of, ludwig, minkus, hansen, s, version, of, swan, lake, was, given, only, four, times, the, final, performance, being, on, 2, january, 1883, and, soon, the, ballet, was, dropped, from, the, repertory, altogether, in, all, swan, lake, was, performed, 41, times, between, its, premi, re, and, the, final, performance, of, 1883, a, rather, lengthy, run, for, a, ballet, that, was, so, poorly, received, upon, its, premi, re, hansen, became, balletmaster, to, the, alhambra, theatre, in, london, and, on, 1, december, 1884, he, presented, a, one, act, ballet, titled, the, swans, which, was, inspired, by, the, second, scene, of, swan, lake, the, music, was, composed, by, the, alhambra, theatre, s, chef, d, orchestre, georges, jacoby, the, second, scene, of, swan, lake, was, then, presented, on, 21, february, in, prague, by, the, ballet, of, the, national, theatre, in, a, version, mounted, by, the, balletmaster, august, berger, the, ballet, was, given, during, two, concerts, which, were, conducted, by, tchaikovsky, the, composer, noted, in, his, diary, that, he, experienced, a, moment, of, absolute, happiness, when, the, ballet, was, performed, berger, s, production, followed, the, 1877, libretto, though, the, names, of, prince, siegfried, and, benno, were, changed, to, jaroslav, and, zde, ek, with, the, r, le, of, benno, danced, by, a, female, dancer, en, travestie, the, r, le, of, prince, siegfried, was, danced, by, berger, himself, with, the, ballerina, giulietta, paltriniera, bergrova, as, odette, berger, s, production, was, only, given, eight, performances, and, was, even, planned, for, production, at, the, fantasia, garden, in, moscow, in, 1893, but, it, never, materialised, during, the, late, 1880s, and, early, 1890s, petipa, and, vsevolozhsky, discussed, with, tchaikovsky, the, possibility, of, reviving, swan, lake, however, tchaikovsky, died, on, 6, november, 1893, just, when, plans, to, revive, swan, lake, were, beginning, to, come, to, fruition, it, remains, uncertain, whether, tchaikovsky, was, prepared, to, revise, the, music, for, this, revival, whatever, the, case, as, a, result, of, tchaikovsky, s, death, riccardo, drigo, revised, the, score, after, receiving, approval, from, tchaikovsky, s, younger, brother, modest, there, are, major, differences, between, drigo, s, and, tchaikovsky, s, scores, today, it, is, drigo, s, revision, and, not, tchaikovsky, s, original, score, of, 1877, that, most, ballet, companies, use, in, february, 1894, two, memorial, concerts, planned, by, vsevolozhsky, were, given, in, honor, of, tchaikovsky, the, production, included, the, second, act, of, swan, lake, choreographed, by, lev, ivanov, second, balletmaster, to, the, imperial, ballet, the, turnout, for, the, revival, concert, was, not, as, great, as, anticipated, due, to, the, mixed, program, as, well, as, higher, than, usual, ticket, prices, leaving, the, theater, hall, half, empty, despite, the, small, audience, ivanov, s, choreography, for, the, memorial, concert, was, unanimously, praised, by, critics, and, audiences, received, the, concert, with, praise, the, revival, of, swan, lake, was, planned, for, pierina, legnani, s, benefit, performance, in, the, 1894, 1895, season, the, death, of, tsar, alexander, iii, on, 1, november, 1894, and, the, ensuing, period, of, official, mourning, brought, all, ballet, performances, and, rehearsals, to, a, close, for, some, time, and, as, a, result, all, efforts, could, be, concentrated, on, the, pre, production, of, the, full, revival, of, swan, lake, ivanov, and, petipa, collaborated, on, the, production, with, ivanov, retaining, his, dances, for, the, second, act, while, choreographing, the, fourth, with, petipa, staging, the, first, and, third, acts, modest, tchaikovsky, was, called, upon, to, make, changes, to, the, ballet, s, libretto, including, the, character, of, odette, changing, from, a, fairy, swan, maiden, into, a, cursed, mortal, woman, the, ballet, s, villain, changing, from, odette, s, stepmother, to, the, magician, von, rothbart, and, the, ballet, s, finale, instead, of, the, lovers, simply, drowning, at, the, hand, of, odette, s, stepmother, as, in, the, original, 1877, scenario, odette, dies, by, drowning, herself, with, prince, siegfried, choosing, to, die, as, well, rather, than, live, without, her, and, soon, the, lovers, spirits, are, reunited, in, an, apotheosis, aside, from, the, revision, of, the, libretto, the, ballet, was, changed, from, four, acts, to, three, with, act, 2, becoming, act, 1, scene, 2, all, was, ready, by, the, beginning, of, 1895, and, the, ballet, had, its, premi, re, on, 27, january, pierina, legnani, danced, odette, odile, with, pavel, gerdt, as, prince, siegfried, alexei, bulgakov, as, rothbart, and, alexander, oblakov, as, benno, most, of, the, reviews, in, the, st, petersburg, newspapers, were, positive, unlike, the, premi, re, of, the, sleeping, beauty, swan, lake, did, not, dominate, the, repertory, of, the, mariinsky, theatre, in, its, first, season, it, was, given, only, sixteen, performances, between, the, premi, re, and, the, 1895, 1896, season, and, was, not, performed, at, all, in, 1897, even, more, surprising, the, ballet, was, performed, only, four, times, in, 1898, and, 1899, the, ballet, belonged, solely, to, legnani, until, she, left, st, petersburg, for, her, native, italy, in, 1901, after, her, departure, the, ballet, was, taken, over, by, mathilde, kschessinskaya, who, was, as, much, celebrated, in, the, r, le, as, was, her, italian, predecessor, throughout, the, performance, history, of, swan, lake, the, 1895, edition, has, served, as, the, version, on, which, most, stagings, have, been, based, nearly, every, balletmaster, or, choreographer, who, has, re, staged, swan, lake, has, made, modifications, to, the, ballet, s, scenario, while, still, maintaining, much, of, the, traditional, choreography, for, the, dances, which, is, regarded, as, virtually, sacrosanct, likewise, over, time, the, r, le, of, siegfried, has, become, more, prominent, due, largely, to, the, evolution, of, ballet, technique, in, 1922, finnish, national, ballet, was, the, first, european, company, that, staged, a, complete, production, of, the, ballet, by, the, time, swan, lake, premiered, in, helsinki, in, 1922, it, had, only, ever, been, performed, by, russian, and, czech, ballet, groups, and, only, visiting, russian, ballet, groups, had, brought, it, to, western, europe, in, 1940, the, san, francisco, ballet, became, the, first, american, company, to, stage, a, complete, production, of, swan, lake, the, enormously, successful, production, starred, lew, christensen, as, prince, siegfried, jacqueline, martin, as, odette, and, janet, reed, as, odile, willam, christensen, based, his, choreography, on, the, petipa, ivanov, production, turning, to, san, francisco, s, large, population, of, russian, migr, s, headed, by, princess, and, prince, vasili, alexandrovich, of, russia, to, help, him, ensure, that, the, production, succeeded, in, its, goal, of, preserving, russian, culture, in, san, francisco, several, notable, productions, have, diverged, from, the, original, and, its, 1895, revival, swan, lake, is, scored, for, the, typical, late, 19th, century, large, orchestra, by, 1895, benno, von, sommerstern, had, become, just, benno, and, odette, queen, of, the, swans, also, baron, von, stein, his, wife, and, freiherr, von, schwarzfels, and, his, wife, were, no, longer, identified, on, the, program, the, sovereign, or, ruling, princess, is, often, rendered, queen, mother, the, character, of, rothbart, sometimes, spelled, rotbart, has, been, open, to, many, interpretations, the, reason, for, his, curse, upon, odette, is, unknown, several, versions, including, two, feature, films, have, suggested, reasons, but, none, is, typically, explained, by, the, ballet, he, is, rarely, portrayed, in, human, form, except, in, act, 3, he, is, usually, shown, as, an, owl, like, creature, in, most, productions, the, couple, s, sacrifice, results, in, his, destruction, however, there, are, versions, in, which, he, is, triumphant, yury, grigorovich, s, version, which, has, been, danced, for, several, decades, by, the, bolshoi, ballet, is, noted, for, including, both, endings, rothbart, was, defeated, in, the, original, 1969, version, in, line, with, soviet, era, expectations, of, an, upbeat, conclusion, but, in, the, 2001, revision, rothbart, plays, a, wicked, game, of, fate, with, siegfried, which, he, wins, at, the, end, causing, siegfried, to, lose, everything, in, the, second, american, ballet, theatre, production, of, swan, lake, he, is, portrayed, by, two, dancers, a, young, handsome, one, who, lures, odette, to, her, doom, in, the, prologue, and, a, reptilian, creature, in, this, version, the, lovers, suicide, inspires, the, rest, of, rothbart, s, imprisoned, swans, to, turn, on, him, and, overcome, his, spell, odile, rothbart, s, daughter, usually, wears, jet, black, though, in, the, 1895, production, she, did, not, and, appears, only, in, act, 3, in, most, modern, productions, she, is, portrayed, as, odette, s, exact, double, though, the, resemblance, is, because, of, rothbart, s, magic, and, therefore, siegfried, cannot, be, blamed, for, believing, her, to, be, odette, there, is, a, suggestion, that, in, the, original, production, odette, and, odile, were, danced, by, two, different, ballerinas, this, is, also, the, case, in, some, avant, garde, productions, swan, lake, is, generally, presented, in, either, four, acts, four, scenes, primarily, outside, russia, and, eastern, europe, or, three, acts, four, scenes, primarily, in, russia, and, eastern, europe, the, biggest, difference, of, productions, all, over, the, world, is, that, the, ending, originally, tragic, is, now, sometimes, altered, to, a, happy, ending, some, productions, include, a, prologue, that, shows, how, odette, first, meets, rothbart, who, turns, odette, into, a, swan, a, magnificent, park, before, a, palace, prince, siegfried, is, celebrating, his, birthday, with, his, tutor, friends, and, peasants, the, revelries, are, interrupted, by, his, mother, the, queen, who, is, concerned, about, his, carefree, lifestyle, she, tells, him, that, he, must, choose, a, bride, at, the, royal, ball, the, following, evening, some, productions, include, the, presentation, of, some, possible, candidates, he, is, upset, that, he, cannot, marry, for, love, his, friend, benno, and, the, tutor, try, to, lift, his, troubled, mood, as, evening, falls, benno, sees, a, flock, of, swans, flying, overhead, and, suggests, they, go, on, a, hunt, siegfried, and, his, friends, take, their, crossbows, and, set, off, in, pursuit, of, the, swans, a, lakeside, clearing, in, a, forest, by, the, ruins, of, a, chapel, a, moonlit, night, siegfried, has, become, separated, from, his, friends, he, arrives, at, the, lakeside, clearing, just, as, a, flock, of, swans, land, he, aims, his, crossbow, but, freezes, when, one, of, them, transforms, into, a, beautiful, maiden, named, odette, at, first, she, is, terrified, of, him, when, he, promises, not, to, harm, her, she, explains, that, she, and, her, companions, are, victims, of, a, spell, cast, by, the, evil, owl, like, sorcerer, named, rothbart, by, day, they, are, turned, into, swans, and, only, at, night, by, the, side, of, the, enchanted, lake, created, from, the, tears, of, odette, s, mother, do, they, return, to, human, form, the, spell, can, only, be, broken, if, one, who, has, never,
