a, mandolin, italian, mandolino, pronounced, literally, small, mandola, is, a, stringed, musical, instrument, in, the, lute, family, and, is, generally, plucked, with, a, pick, it, most, commonly, has, four, courses, of, doubled, strings, tuned, in, unison, thus, giving, a, total, of, eight, strings, a, variety, of, string, types, are, used, with, steel, strings, being, the, most, common, and, usually, the, least, expensive, the, courses, are, typically, tuned, in, an, interval, of, perfect, fifths, with, the, same, tuning, as, a, violin, g3, d4, a4, e5, also, like, the, violin, it, is, the, soprano, member, of, a, family, that, includes, the, mandola, octave, mandolin, mandocello, and, mandobass, there, are, many, styles, of, mandolin, but, the, three, most, common, types, are, the, neapolitan, or, round, backed, mandolin, the, archtop, mandolin, and, the, flat, backed, mandolin, the, round, backed, version, has, a, deep, bottom, constructed, of, strips, of, wood, glued, together, into, a, bowl, the, archtop, also, known, as, the, carved, top, mandolin, has, an, arched, top, and, a, shallower, arched, back, both, carved, out, of, wood, the, flat, backed, mandolin, uses, thin, sheets, of, wood, for, the, body, braced, on, the, inside, for, strength, in, a, similar, manner, to, a, guitar, each, style, of, instrument, has, its, own, sound, quality, and, is, associated, with, particular, forms, of, music, neapolitan, mandolins, feature, prominently, in, european, classical, music, and, traditional, music, archtop, instruments, are, common, in, american, folk, music, and, bluegrass, music, flat, backed, instruments, are, commonly, used, in, irish, british, and, brazilian, folk, music, and, mexican, estudiantinas, other, mandolin, variations, differ, primarily, in, the, number, of, strings, and, include, four, string, models, tuned, in, fifths, such, as, the, brescian, and, cremonese, six, string, types, tuned, in, fourths, such, as, the, milanese, lombard, and, sicilian, six, course, instruments, of, 12, strings, two, strings, per, course, such, as, the, genoese, and, the, tricordia, with, four, triple, string, courses, 12, strings, total, much, of, mandolin, development, revolved, around, the, soundboard, the, top, early, instruments, were, quiet, strung, with, gut, strings, and, plucked, with, the, fingers, or, with, a, quill, however, modern, instruments, are, louder, using, metal, strings, which, exert, more, pressure, than, the, gut, strings, the, modern, soundboard, is, designed, to, withstand, the, pressure, of, metal, strings, that, would, break, earlier, instruments, the, soundboard, comes, in, many, shapes, but, generally, round, or, teardrop, shaped, sometimes, with, scrolls, or, other, projections, there, are, usually, one, or, more, sound, holes, in, the, soundboard, either, round, oval, or, shaped, like, a, calligraphic, f, f, hole, a, round, or, oval, sound, hole, may, be, covered, or, bordered, with, decorative, rosettes, or, purfling, mandolins, evolved, from, lute, family, instruments, in, europe, predecessors, include, the, gittern, and, mandore, or, mandola, in, italy, during, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, there, were, a, variety, of, regional, variants, but, the, two, most, widespread, ones, were, the, neapolitan, mandolin, and, the, lombard, mandolin, the, neapolitan, style, has, spread, worldwide, mandolins, have, a, body, that, acts, as, a, resonator, attached, to, a, neck, the, resonating, body, may, be, shaped, as, a, bowl, necked, bowl, lutes, or, a, box, necked, box, lutes, traditional, italian, mandolins, such, as, the, neapolitan, mandolin, meet, the, necked, bowl, description, the, necked, box, instruments, include, archtop, mandolins, and, the, flatback, mandolins, strings, run, between, mechanical, tuning, machines, at, the, top, of, the, neck, to, a, tailpiece, that, anchors, the, other, end, of, the, strings, the, strings, are, suspended, over, the, neck, and, soundboard, and, pass, over, a, floating, bridge, the, bridge, is, kept, in, contact, with, the, soundboard, by, the, downward, pressure, from, the, strings, the, neck, is, either, flat, or, has, a, slight, radius, and, is, covered, with, a, fingerboard, with, frets, the, action, of, the, strings, on, the, bridge, causes, the, soundboard, to, vibrate, producing, sound, like, any, plucked, instrument, mandolin, notes, decay, to, silence, rather, than, sound, out, continuously, as, with, a, bowed, note, on, a, violin, and, mandolin, notes, decay, faster, than, larger, chordophones, like, the, guitar, this, encourages, the, use, of, tremolo, rapid, picking, of, one, or, more, pairs, of, strings, to, create, sustained, notes, or, chords, the, mandolin, s, paired, strings, facilitate, this, technique, the, plectrum, pick, strikes, each, of, a, pair, of, strings, alternately, providing, a, more, full, and, continuous, sound, than, a, single, string, would, various, design, variations, and, amplification, techniques, have, been, used, to, make, mandolins, comparable, in, volume, with, louder, instruments, and, orchestras, including, the, creation, of, mandolin, banjo, hybrids, with, the, drum, like, body, of, the, louder, banjo, adding, metal, resonators, most, notably, by, dobro, and, the, national, string, instrument, corporation, to, make, a, resonator, mandolin, and, amplifying, electric, mandolins, through, amplifiers, a, variety, of, different, tunings, are, used, usually, courses, of, 2, adjacent, strings, are, tuned, in, unison, by, far, the, most, common, tuning, is, the, same, as, violin, tuning, in, scientific, pitch, notation, g, 3, d, 4, a, 4, e, 5, or, in, helmholtz, pitch, notation, g, d, a, e, the, numbers, of, hz, shown, above, assume, a, 440, hz, a, standard, in, most, parts, of, the, western, world, some, players, use, an, a, up, to, 10, hz, above, or, below, a, 440, mainly, outside, the, united, states, other, tunings, exist, including, cross, tunings, in, which, the, usually, doubled, string, runs, are, tuned, to, different, pitches, additionally, guitarists, may, sometimes, tune, a, mandolin, to, mimic, a, portion, of, the, intervals, on, a, standard, guitar, tuning, to, achieve, familiar, fretting, patterns, the, mandolin, is, the, soprano, member, of, the, mandolin, family, as, the, violin, is, the, soprano, member, of, the, violin, family, like, the, violin, its, scale, length, is, typically, about, 13, inches, 330, mm, modern, american, mandolins, modelled, after, gibsons, have, a, longer, scale, about, 13, 7, 8, inches, 350, mm, the, strings, in, each, of, its, double, strung, courses, are, tuned, in, unison, and, the, courses, use, the, same, tuning, as, the, violin, g, 3, d, 4, a, 4, e, 5, the, piccolo, or, sopranino, mandolin, is, a, rare, member, of, the, family, tuned, one, octave, above, the, mandola, and, one, fourth, above, the, mandolin, c, 4, g, 4, d, 5, a, 5, the, same, relation, as, that, of, the, piccolo, to, the, western, concert, flute, or, violino, piccolo, to, the, violin, and, viola, one, model, was, manufactured, by, the, lyon, healy, company, under, the, leland, brand, a, handful, of, contemporary, luthiers, build, piccolo, mandolins, the, mandola, termed, the, tenor, mandola, in, britain, and, ireland, and, liola, or, alto, mandolin, in, continental, europe, is, tuned, a, fifth, below, the, mandolin, in, the, same, relationship, as, that, of, the, viola, to, the, violin, some, also, call, this, instrument, the, alto, mandola, its, scale, length, is, typically, about, 16, 1, 2, inches, 420, mm, it, is, normally, tuned, like, a, viola, perfect, fifth, below, the, mandolin, and, tenor, banjo, c, 3, g, 3, d, 4, a, 4, the, octave, mandolin, us, and, canada, termed, the, octave, mandola, in, britain, and, ireland, and, mandola, in, continental, europe, is, tuned, an, octave, below, the, mandolin, g, 2, d, 3, a, 3, e, 4, its, relationship, to, the, mandolin, is, that, of, the, tenor, violin, to, the, violin, or, the, tenor, saxophone, to, the, soprano, saxophone, octave, mandolin, scale, length, is, typically, about, 20, inches, 510, mm, although, instruments, with, scales, as, short, as, 17, inches, 430, mm, or, as, long, as, 21, inches, 530, mm, are, not, unknown, the, instrument, has, a, variant, off, the, coast, of, south, america, in, trinidad, where, it, is, known, as, the, bandol, a, flat, backed, instrument, with, four, courses, the, lower, two, strung, with, metal, and, nylon, strings, the, irish, bouzouki, though, not, strictly, a, member, of, the, mandolin, family, has, a, reasonable, resemblance, and, similar, range, to, the, octave, mandolin, it, derives, from, the, greek, bouzouki, a, long, necked, lute, constructed, like, a, flat, backed, mandolin, and, uses, fifth, based, tunings, most, often, g, 2, d, 3, a, 3, d, 4, other, tunings, include, a, 2, d, 3, a, 3, d, 4, g, 2, d, 3, a, 3, e, 4, an, octave, below, the, mandolin, in, which, case, it, essentially, functions, as, an, octave, mandolin, g, 2, d, 3, g, 3, d, 4, or, a, 2, d, 3, a, 3, e, 4, although, the, irish, bouzouki, s, bass, course, pairs, are, most, often, tuned, in, unison, on, some, instruments, one, of, each, pair, is, replaced, with, a, lighter, string, and, tuned, in, octaves, similar, to, the, 12, string, guitar, while, occupying, the, same, range, as, the, octave, mandolin, octave, mandola, the, irish, bouzouki, is, theoretically, distinguished, from, the, former, instrument, by, its, longer, scale, length, typically, from, 24, to, 26, inches, 610, to, 660, mm, although, scales, as, long, as, 27, inches, 690, mm, which, is, the, usual, greek, bouzouki, scale, are, not, unknown, in, modern, usage, however, the, terms, octave, mandolin, and, irish, bouzouki, are, often, used, interchangeably, to, refer, to, the, same, instrument, the, modern, cittern, may, also, be, loosely, included, in, an, extended, mandolin, family, based, on, resemblance, to, the, flat, backed, mandolins, which, it, predates, its, own, lineage, dates, it, back, to, the, renaissance, it, is, typically, a, five, course, ten, string, instrument, having, a, scale, length, between, 20, and, 22, inches, 510, and, 560, mm, the, instrument, is, most, often, tuned, to, either, d, 2, g, 2, d, 3, a, 3, d, 4, or, g, 2, d, 3, a, 3, d, 4, a, 4, and, is, essentially, an, octave, mandola, with, a, fifth, course, at, either, the, top, or, the, bottom, of, its, range, some, luthiers, such, as, stefan, sobell, also, refer, to, the, octave, mandola, or, a, shorter, scaled, irish, bouzouki, as, a, cittern, irrespective, of, whether, it, has, four, or, five, courses, other, relatives, of, the, cittern, which, might, also, be, loosely, linked, to, the, mandolins, and, are, sometimes, tuned, and, played, as, such, include, the, 6, course, 12, string, portuguese, guitar, and, the, 5, course, 9, string, waldzither, the, mandocello, is, classically, tuned, to, an, octave, plus, a, fifth, below, the, mandolin, in, the, same, relationship, as, that, of, the, cello, to, the, violin, its, strings, being, tuned, to, c, 2, g, 2, d, 3, a, 3, its, scale, length, is, typically, about, 26, inches, 660, mm, a, typical, violoncello, scale, is, 27, inches, 690, mm, the, mandolone, was, a, baroque, member, of, the, mandolin, family, in, the, bass, range, that, was, surpassed, by, the, mandocello, it, was, part, of, the, neapolitan, mandolin, family, the, greek, laouto, or, laghouto, long, necked, lute, is, similar, to, a, mandocello, ordinarily, tuned, c, 3, c, 2, g, 3, g, 2, d, 3, d, 3, a, 3, a, 3, with, half, of, each, pair, of, the, lower, two, courses, being, tuned, an, octave, high, on, a, lighter, gauge, string, the, body, is, a, staved, bowl, the, saddle, less, bridge, glued, to, the, flat, face, like, most, ouds, and, lutes, with, mechanical, tuners, steel, strings, and, tied, gut, frets, modern, laoutos, as, played, on, crete, have, the, entire, lower, course, tuned, to, c, 3, a, reentrant, octave, above, the, expected, low, c, its, scale, length, is, typically, about, 28, inches, 710, mm, the, algerian, mandole, was, developed, by, an, italian, luthier, in, the, early, 1930s, scaled, up, from, a, mandola, until, it, reached, a, scale, length, of, approximately, 25, to, 27, inches, it, is, a, flatback, instrument, with, a, wide, neck, and, 4, courses, 8, strings, 5, courses, 10, strings, or, 6, courses, 12, strings, and, is, used, in, algeria, and, morocco, the, instrument, can, be, tuned, as, a, guitar, oud, or, mandocello, depending, on, the, music, it, will, be, used, to, play, and, player, preference, when, tuning, it, as, a, guitar, the, strings, will, be, tuned, e, 2, e, 2, a, 2, a, 2, d, 3, d, 3, g, 3, g, 3, b, 3, b, 3, e, 4, e, 4, strings, in, parentheses, are, dropped, for, a, five, or, four, course, instrument, using, a, common, arabic, oud, tuning, d, 2, d, 2, g, 2, g, 2, a, 2, a, 2, d, 3, d, 3, g, 3, g, 3, c, 4, c, 4, for, a, mandocello, tuning, using, fifths, c, 2, c, 2, g, 2, g, 2, d, 3, d, 3, a, 3, a, 3, e, 4, e, 4, the, mandobass, is, the, bass, version, of, the, mandolin, just, as, the, double, bass, is, the, bass, to, the, violin, like, the, double, bass, it, most, frequently, has, 4, single, strings, rather, than, double, courses, and, like, the, double, bass, it, is, most, commonly, tuned, to, perfect, fourths, rather, than, fifths, like, most, mandolin, family, instruments, e, 1, a, 1, d, 2, g, 2, the, same, tuning, as, a, bass, guitar, these, were, made, by, the, gibson, company, in, the, early, 20th, century, was, also, never, very, common, a, smaller, scale, four, string, mandobass, usually, tuned, in, fifths, g, 1, d, 2, a, 2, e, 3, two, octaves, below, the, mandolin, though, not, as, resonant, as, the, larger, instrument, was, often, preferred, by, players, as, easier, to, handle, and, more, portable, reportedly, however, most, mandolin, orchestras, preferred, to, use, the, ordinary, double, bass, rather, than, a, specialised, mandolin, family, instrument, calace, and, other, italian, makers, predating, gibson, also, made, mandolin, basses, the, relatively, rare, eight, string, mandobass, or, tremolo, bass, also, exists, with, double, courses, like, the, rest, of, the, mandolin, family, and, is, tuned, either, g, 1, d, 2, a, 2, e, 3, two, octaves, lower, than, the, mandolin, or, c, 1, g, 1, d, 2, a, 2, two, octaves, below, the, mandola, bowlback, mandolins, also, known, as, roundbacks, are, used, worldwide, they, are, most, commonly, manufactured, in, europe, where, the, long, history, of, mandolin, development, has, created, local, styles, however, japanese, luthiers, also, make, them, owing, to, the, shape, and, to, the, common, construction, from, wood, strips, of, alternating, colors, in, the, united, states, these, are, sometimes, colloquially, referred, to, as, the, potato, bug, potato, beetle, or, tater, bug, mandolin, the, neapolitan, style, has, an, almond, shaped, body, resembling, a, bowl, constructed, from, curved, strips, of, wood, it, usually, has, a, bent, sound, table, canted, in, two, planes, with, the, design, to, take, the, tension, of, the, eight, metal, strings, arranged, in, four, courses, a, hardwood, fingerboard, sits, on, top, of, or, is, flush, with, the, sound, table, very, old, instruments, may, use, wooden, tuning, pegs, while, newer, instruments, tend, to, use, geared, metal, tuners, the, bridge, is, a, movable, length, of, hardwood, a, pickguard, is, glued, below, the, sound, hole, under, the, strings, european, roundbacks, commonly, use, a, 13, inch, 330, mm, scale, instead, of, the, 13, 7, 8, inches, 350, mm, common, on, archtop, mandolins, intertwined, with, the, neapolitan, style, is, the, roman, style, mandolin, which, has, influenced, it, the, roman, mandolin, had, a, fingerboard, that, was, more, curved, and, narrow, the, fingerboard, was, lengthened, over, the, sound, hole, for, the, e, strings, the, high, pitched, strings, the, shape, of, the, back, of, the, neck, was, different, less, rounded, with, an, edge, the, bridge, was, curved, making, the, g, strings, higher, the, roman, mandolin, had, mechanical, tuning, gears, before, the, neapolitan, prominent, italian, manufacturers, include, vinaccia, naples, embergher, rome, and, calace, naples, other, modern, manufacturers, include, lorenzo, lippi, milan, hendrik, van, den, broek, netherlands, brian, dean, canada, salvatore, masiello, and, michele, caiazza, la, bottega, del, mandolino, and, ferrara, gabriele, pandini, in, the, united, states, when, the, bowlback, was, being, made, in, numbers, lyon, and, healy, was, a, major, manufacturer, especially, under, the, washburn, brand, other, american, manufacturers, include, martin, vega, and, larson, brothers, in, canada, brian, dean, has, manufactured, instruments, in, neapolitan, roman, german, and, american, styles, but, is, also, known, for, his, original, grand, concert, design, created, for, american, virtuoso, joseph, brent, german, manufacturers, include, albert, mueller, dietrich, klaus, knorr, reinhold, seiffert, and, alfred, woll, the, german, bowlbacks, use, a, style, developed, by, seiffert, with, a, larger, and, rounder, body, japanese, brands, include, kunishima, and, suzuki, other, japanese, manufacturers, include, oona, kawada, noguchi, toichiro, ishikawa, rokutaro, nakade, otiai, tadao, yoshihiko, takusari, nokuti, makoto, watanabe, kanou, kadama, and, ochiai, another, family, of, bowlback, mandolins, came, from, milan, and, lombardy, these, mandolins, are, closer, to, the, mandolino, or, mandore, than, other, modern, mandolins, they, are, shorter, and, wider, than, the, standard, neapolitan, mandolin, with, a, shallow, back, the, instruments, have, 6, strings, 3, wire, treble, strings, and, 3, gut, or, wire, wrapped, silk, bass, strings, the, strings, ran, between, the, tuning, pegs, and, a, bridge, that, was, glued, to, the, soundboard, as, a, guitar, s, the, lombard, mandolins, were, tuned, g, b, e, a, d, g, shown, in, helmholtz, pitch, notation, a, developer, of, the, milanese, style, was, antonio, monzino, milan, and, his, family, who, made, them, for, six, generations, samuel, adelstein, described, the, lombard, mandolin, in, 1893, as, wider, and, shorter, than, the, neapolitan, mandolin, with, a, shallower, back, and, a, shorter, and, wider, neck, with, six, single, strings, to, the, regular, mandolin, s, set, of, 4, the, lombard, was, tuned, c, d, a, e, b, g, the, strings, were, fastened, to, the, bridge, like, a, guitar, s, there, were, 20, frets, covering, three, octaves, with, an, additional, 5, notes, when, adelstein, wrote, there, were, no, nylon, strings, and, the, gut, and, single, strings, do, not, vibrate, so, clearly, and, sweetly, as, the, double, steel, string, of, the, neapolitan, brescian, mandolins, also, known, as, cremonese, that, have, survived, in, museums, have, four, gut, strings, instead, of, six, and, a, fixed, bridge, the, mandolin, was, tuned, in, fifths, like, the, neapolitan, mandolin, in, his, 1805, mandolin, method, anweisung, die, mandoline, von, selbst, zu, erlernen, nebst, einigen, uebungsstucken, von, bortolazzi, bartolomeo, bortolazzi, popularised, the, cremonese, mandolin, which, had, four, single, strings, and, a, fixed, bridge, to, which, the, strings, were, attached, bortolazzi, said, in, this, book, that, the, new, wire, strung, mandolins, were, uncomfortable, to, play, when, compared, with, the, gut, string, instruments, also, he, felt, they, had, a, less, pleasing, hard, zither, like, tone, as, compared, to, the, gut, string, s, softer, full, singing, tone, he, favored, the, four, single, strings, of, the, cremonese, instrument, which, were, tuned, the, same, as, the, neapolitan, like, the, lombard, mandolin, the, genoese, mandolin, was, not, tuned, in, fifths, its, 6, gut, strings, or, 6, courses, of, strings, were, tuned, as, a, guitar, but, one, octave, higher, e, a, d, g, b, natural, e, like, the, neapolitan, and, unlike, the, lombard, mandolin, the, genoese, does, not, have, the, bridge, glued, to, the, soundboard, but, holds, the, bridge, on, with, downward, tension, from, strings, that, run, between, the, bottom, and, neck, of, the, instrument, the, neck, was, wider, than, the, neapolitan, mandolin, s, neck, the, peg, head, is, similar, to, the, guitar, s, at, the, very, end, of, the, 19th, century, a, new, style, with, a, carved, top, and, back, construction, inspired, by, violin, family, instruments, began, to, supplant, the, european, style, bowl, back, instruments, in, the, united, states, this, new, style, is, credited, to, mandolins, designed, and, built, by, orville, gibson, a, kalamazoo, michigan, luthier, who, founded, the, gibson, mandolin, guitar, manufacturing, co, limited, in, 1902, gibson, mandolins, evolved, into, two, basic, styles, the, florentine, or, f, style, which, has, a, decorative, scroll, near, the, neck, two, points, on, the, lower, body, and, usually, a, scroll, carved, into, the, headstock, and, the, a, style, which, is, pear, shaped, has, no, points, and, usually, has, a, simpler, headstock, these, styles, generally, have, either, two, f, shaped, soundholes, like, a, violin, f, 5, and, a, 5, or, a, single, oval, sound, hole, f, 4, and, a, 4, and, lower, models, directly, under, the, strings, much, variation, exists, between, makers, working, from, these, archetypes, and, other, variants, have, become, increasingly, common, generally, in, the, united, states, gibson, f, hole, f, 5, mandolins, and, mandolins, influenced, by, that, design, are, strongly, associated, with, bluegrass, while, the, a, style, is, associated, with, other, types, of, music, although, it, too, is, most, often, used, for, and, associated, with, bluegrass, the, f, 5, s, more, complicated, woodwork, also, translates, into, a, more, expensive, instrument, internal, bracing, to, support, the, top, in, the, f, style, mandolins, is, usually, achieved, with, parallel, tone, bars, similar, to, the, bass, bar, on, a, violin, some, makers, instead, employ, x, bracing, which, is, two, tone, bars, mortised, together, to, form, an, x, some, luthiers, now, using, a, modified, x, bracing, that, incorporates, both, a, tone, bar, and, x, bracing, numerous, modern, mandolin, makers, build, instruments, that, largely, replicate, the, gibson, f, 5, artist, models, built, in, the, early, 1920s, under, the, supervision, of, gibson, acoustician, lloyd, loar, original, loar, signed, instruments, are, sought, after, and, extremely, valuable, other, makers, from, the, loar, period, and, earlier, include, lyon, and, healy, vega, and, larson, brothers, the, ideal, for, archtops, has, been, solid, pieces, of, wood, carved, into, the, right, shape, however, another, archtop, exists, the, top, made, of, laminated, wood, or, thin, sheets, of, solid, wood, pressed, into, the, arched, shape, these, have, become, increasingly, common, in, the, world, of, internationally, constructed, musical, instruments, in, the, 21st, century, pressed, top, instruments, are, made, to, appear, the, same, as, carved, top, instruments, but, do, not, sound, the, same,

create, a, second, hollow, space, within, the, instrument, modern, mandolinists, such, as, joseph, brent, and, avi, avital, use, instruments, customized, either, by, the, luthier, s, choice, or, at, the, request, of, the, player, joseph, brent, s, mandolin, made, by, brian, dean, also, uses, what, brent, calls, a, false, back, brent, s, mandolin, was, the, luthier, s, solution, to, brent, s, request, for, a, loud, mandolin, in, which, the, wood, was, clearly, audible, with, less, metallic, sound, from, the, strings, the, type, used, by, avital, is, variation, of, the, flatback, with, a,

called, a, cylinder, back, mandolin, manufactured, by, the, vega, company, between, 1913, and, roughly, 1927, which, had, a, similar, longitudinal, bulge, but, on, the, back, rather, than, the, front, of, the, instrument, an, instrument, with, a, mandolin, neck, paired, with, a, banjo, style, body, was, patented, by, benjamin, bradbury, of, brooklyn, in, 1882, and, given, the, name, banjolin, by, john, farris, in, 1885, today, banjolin, is, sometimes, reserved, to, describe, an, instrument, with, four, strings, while, the, version, with, the, four, courses, of, double, strings, is, called, a, mandolin, banjo, a, resonator, mandolin, or, resophonic, mandolin, is, a, mandolin, whose, sound, is, produced, by, one, or, more, metal, cones, resonators, instead, of, the, customary, wooden,

these, mandolins, can, have, four, or, five, individual, or, double, courses, of, strings, they, were, developed, in, the, early, 1930s, contemporaneous, with, the, development, of, the, electric, guitar, they, come, in, solid, body, and, acoustic, electric, forms, specific, instruments, have, been, designed, to, overcome, the, mandolin, s, rapid, decay, with, its, plucked, notes, fender, released, a, model, in, 1992, with, an, additional, string, a, high, a, above, the, e, string, a, tremolo, bridge, and, extra, humbucker, pickup, total, of, two, the, result, was, an, instrument, capable, of, playing, heavy, metal, style, guitar, riffs, or, violin, like, passages, with, sustained, notes, that, can, be, adjusted, as, with, an, electric, guitar, the, international, repertoire, of, music, for, mandolin, is, almost, unlimited, and, musicians, use, it, to, play, various, types, of, music, this, is, especially, true, of, violin, music, since, the, mandolin, has, the, same, tuning, as, the, violin, following, its, invention, and, early, development, in, italy, the, mandolin, spread, throughout, the, european, continent, the, instrument, was, primarily, used, in, a, classical, tradition, with, mandolin, orchestras, so, called, estudiantinas, or, in, germany, zupforchestern, appearing, in, many, cities, following, this, continental, popularity, of, the, mandolin, family, local, traditions, appeared, outside, europe, in, the, americas, and, in, japan, travelling, mandolin, virtuosi, like, carlo, curti, giuseppe, pettine, raffaele, calace, and, silvio, ranieri, contributed, to, the, mandolin, becoming, a, fad, instrument, in, the, early, 20th, century, this, mandolin, craze, was, fading, by, the, 1930s, but, just, as, this, practice, was, falling, into, disuse, the, mandolin, found, a, new, niche, in, american, country, old, time, music, bluegrass, and, folk, music, more, recently, the, baroque, and, classical, mandolin, repertory, and, styles, have, benefited, from, the, raised, awareness, of, and, interest, in, early, music, with, media, attention, to, classical, players, such, as, israeli, avi, avital, italian, carlo, aonzo, and, american, joseph, brent, in, india, the, mandolin, is, played, in, classical, carnatic, music, the, musician, u, srinivas, was, perhaps, the, greatest, mandolin, player, in, this, style, lauded, across, the, world, for, his, virtuosity, with, the, instrument, he, died, young, the, tradition, of, so, called, classical, music, for, the, mandolin, has, been, somewhat, spotty, due, to, its, being, widely, perceived, as, a, folk, instrument, significant, composers, did, write, music, specifically, for, the, mandolin, but, few, large, works, were, composed, for, it, by, the, most, widely, regarded, composers, the, total, number, of, these, works, is, rather, small, in, comparison, to, say, those, composed, for, violin, one, result, of, this, dearth, being, that, there, were, few, positions, for, mandolinists, in, regular, orchestras, to, fill, this, gap, in, the, literature, mandolin, orchestras, have, traditionally, played, many, arrangements, of, music, written, for, regular, orchestras, or, other, ensembles, some, players, have, sought, out, contemporary, composers, to, solicit, new, works, furthermore, of, the, works, that, have, been, written, for, mandolin, from, the, 18th, century, onward, many, have, been, lost, or, forgotten, some, of, these, await, discovery, in, museums, and, libraries, and, archives, one, example, of, rediscovered, 18th, century, music, for,
