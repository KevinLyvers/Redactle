contemporary, classical, music, is, western, art, music, composed, close, to, the, present, day, at, the, beginning, of, the, 21st, century, it, commonly, referred, to, the, post, 1945, modern, forms, of, post, tonal, music, after, the, death, of, anton, webern, and, included, serial, music, electronic, music, experimental, music, and, minimalist, music, newer, forms, of, music, include, spectral, music, and, post, minimalism, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, composers, of, classical, music, were, experimenting, with, an, increasingly, dissonant, pitch, language, which, sometimes, yielded, atonal, pieces, following, world, war, i, as, a, backlash, against, what, they, saw, as, the, increasingly, exaggerated, gestures, and, formlessness, of, late, romanticism, certain, composers, adopted, a, neoclassic, style, which, sought, to, recapture, the, balanced, forms, and, clearly, perceptible, thematic, processes, of, earlier, styles, see, also, new, objectivity, and, social, realism, after, world, war, ii, modernist, composers, sought, to, achieve, greater, levels, of, control, in, their, composition, process, e, g, through, the, use, of, the, twelve, tone, technique, and, later, total, serialism, at, the, same, time, conversely, composers, also, experimented, with, means, of, abdicating, control, exploring, indeterminacy, or, aleatoric, processes, in, smaller, or, larger, degrees, technological, advances, led, to, the, birth, of, electronic, music, experimentation, with, tape, loops, and, repetitive, textures, contributed, to, the, advent, of, minimalism, still, other, composers, started, exploring, the, theatrical, potential, of, the, musical, performance, performance, art, mixed, media, fluxus, new, works, of, contemporary, classical, music, continue, to, be, created, each, year, the, boston, conservatory, at, berklee, presents, 700, performances, new, works, from, contemporary, classical, music, program, students, comprise, roughly, 150, of, these, performances, to, some, extent, european, and, the, us, traditions, diverged, after, world, war, ii, among, the, most, influential, composers, in, europe, were, pierre, boulez, luigi, nono, and, karlheinz, stockhausen, the, first, and, last, were, both, pupils, of, olivier, messiaen, an, important, aesthetic, philosophy, as, well, as, a, group, of, compositional, techniques, at, this, time, was, serialism, also, called, through, ordered, music, total, music, or, total, tone, ordering, which, took, as, its, starting, point, the, compositions, of, arnold, schoenberg, and, anton, webern, and, thus, was, opposed, to, traditional, twelve, tone, music, and, was, also, closely, related, to, le, corbusier, s, idea, of, the, modulor, however, some, more, traditionally, based, composers, such, as, dmitri, shostakovich, and, benjamin, britten, maintained, a, tonal, style, of, composition, despite, the, prominent, serialist, movement, in, america, composers, like, milton, babbitt, john, cage, elliott, carter, henry, cowell, philip, glass, steve, reich, george, rochberg, and, roger, sessions, formed, their, own, ideas, some, of, these, composers, cage, cowell, glass, reich, represented, a, new, methodology, of, experimental, music, which, began, to, question, fundamental, notions, of, music, such, as, notation, performance, duration, and, repetition, while, others, babbitt, rochberg, sessions, fashioned, their, own, extensions, of, the, twelve, tone, serialism, of, schoenberg, the, vocabulary, of, extended, tonality, which, flourished, in, the, late, 19th, and, very, early, 20th, centuries, continues, to, be, used, by, contemporary, composers, it, has, never, been, considered, shocking, or, controversial, in, the, larger, musical, world, as, has, been, demonstrated, statistically, for, the, united, states, at, least, where, most, composers, continued, working, in, what, has, remained, throughout, this, century, the, mainstream, of, tonal, oriented, composition, serialism, is, one, of, the, most, important, post, war, movements, among, the, high, modernist, schools, serialism, more, specifically, named, integral, or, compound, serialism, was, led, by, composers, such, as, pierre, boulez, bruno, maderna, luigi, nono, and, karlheinz, stockhausen, in, europe, and, by, milton, babbitt, donald, martino, mario, davidovsky, and, charles, wuorinen, in, the, united, states, some, of, their, compositions, use, an, ordered, set, or, several, such, sets, which, may, be, the, basis, for, the, whole, composition, while, others, use, unordered, sets, the, term, is, also, often, used, for, dodecaphony, or, twelve, tone, technique, which, is, alternatively, regarded, as, the, model, for, integral, serialism, despite, its, decline, in, the, last, third, of, the, 20th, century, there, remained, at, the, end, of, the, century, an, active, core, of, composers, who, continued, to, advance, the, ideas, and, forms, of, high, modernism, those, no, longer, living, include, pierre, boulez, pauline, oliveros, toru, takemitsu, jacob, druckman, george, perle, ralph, shapey, franco, donatoni, jonathan, harvey, erkki, salmenhaara, and, henrik, otto, donner, those, still, living, in, june, 2024, include, magnus, lindberg, george, benjamin, brian, ferneyhough, wolfgang, rihm, richard, wernick, richard, wilson, and, james, macmillan, between, 1975, and, 1990, a, shift, in, the, paradigm, of, computer, technology, had, taken, place, making, electronic, music, systems, affordable, and, widely, accessible, the, personal, computer, had, become, an, essential, component, of, the, electronic, musician, s, equipment, superseding, analog, synthesizers, and, fulfilling, the, traditional, functions, of, composition, and, scoring, synthesis, and, sound, processing, sampling, of, audio, input, and, control, over, external, equipment, some, authors, equate, polystylism, with, eclecticism, while, others, make, a, sharp, distinction, musical, historicism, the, use, of, historical, materials, structures, styles, techniques, media, conceptual, content, etc, whether, by, a, single, composer, or, those, associated, with, a, particular, school, movement, or, period, is, evident, to, varying, degrees, in, minimalism, post, minimalism, world, music, and, other, genres, in, which, tonal, traditions, have, been, sustained, or, have, undergone, a, significant, revival, in, recent, decades, some, post, minimalist, works, employ, medieval, and, other, genres, associated, with, early, music, such, as, the, oi, me, lasso, and, other, laude, of, gavin, bryars, the, historicist, movement, is, closely, related, to, the, emergence, of, musicology, and, the, early, music, revival, a, number, of, historicist, composers, have, been, influenced, by, their, intimate, familiarity, with, the, instrumental, practices, of, earlier, periods, hendrik, bouman, grant, colburn, michael, talbot, paulo, galv, o, roman, turovsky, savchuk, the, musical, historicism, movement, has, also, been, stimulated, by, the, formation, of, such, international, organizations, as, the, delian, society, and, vox, saeculorum, some, composers, have, emerged, since, the, 1980s, who, are, influenced, by, art, rock, for, example, rhys, chatham, new, complexity, is, a, current, within, today, s, european, contemporary, avant, garde, music, scene, named, in, reaction, to, the, new, simplicity, amongst, the, candidates, suggested, for, having, coined, the, term, are, the, composer, nigel, osborne, the, belgian, musicologist, harry, halbreich, and, the, british, australian, musicologist, richard, toop, who, gave, currency, to, the, concept, of, a, movement, with, his, article, four, facets, of, the, new, complexity, though, often, atonal, highly, abstract, and, dissonant, in, sound, the, new, complexity, is, most, readily, characterized, by, the, use, of, techniques, which, require, complex, musical, notation, this, includes, extended, techniques, microtonality, odd, tunings, highly, disjunct, melodic, contour, innovative, timbres, complex, polyrhythms, unconventional, instrumentations, abrupt, changes, in, loudness, and, intensity, and, so, on, the, diverse, group, of, composers, writing, in, this, style, includes, richard, barrett, brian, ferneyhough, claus,
