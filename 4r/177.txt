he, had, read, and, discussed, with, lewis, his, recently, completed, fourth, book, the, silver, chair, originally, entitled, night, under, narnia, lewis, described, the, origin, of, the, lion, the, witch, and, the, wardrobe, in, an, essay, entitled, it, all, began, with, a, picture, the, lion, all, began, with, a, picture, of, a, faun, carrying, an, umbrella, and, parcels, in, a, snowy, wood, this, picture, had, been, in, my, mind, since, i, was, about, sixteen, then, one, day, when, i, was, about, forty, i, said, to, myself, let, s, try, to, make, a, story, about, it, shortly, before, the, start, of, world, war, ii, many, children, were, evacuated, to, the, english, countryside, in, anticipation, of, attacks, on, london, and, other, major, urban, areas, by, nazi, germany, as, a, result, on, 2, september, 1939, three, school, girls, named, margaret, mary, and, katherine, came, to, live, at, the, kilns, in, risinghurst, lewis, s, home, three, miles, east, of, oxford, city, centre, lewis, later, suggested, that, the, experience, gave, him, a, new, appreciation, of, children, and, in, late, september, he, began, a, children, s, story, on, an, odd, sheet, of, paper, which, has, survived, as, part, of, another, manuscript, this, book, is, about, four, children, whose, names, were, ann, martin, rose, and, peter, but, it, is, most, about, peter, who, was, the, youngest, they, all, had, to, go, away, from, london, suddenly, because, of, air, raids, and, because, father, who, was, in, the, army, had, gone, off, to, the, war, and, mother, was, doing, some, kind, of, war, work, they, were, sent, to, stay, with, a, kind, of, relation, of, mother, s, who, was, a, very, old, professor, who, lived, all, by, himself, in, the, country, in, it, all, began, with, a, picture, c, s, lewis, continues, at, first, i, had, very, little, idea, how, the, story, would, go, but, then, suddenly, aslan, came, bounding, into, it, i, think, i, had, been, having, a, good, many, dreams, of, lions, about, that, time, apart, from, that, i, don, t, know, where, the, lion, came, from, or, why, he, came, but, once, he, was, there, he, pulled, the, whole, story, together, and, soon, he, pulled, the, six, other, narnian, stories, in, after, him, although, lewis, pleaded, ignorance, about, the, source, of, his, inspiration, for, aslan, jared, lobdell, digging, into, lewis, s, history, to, explore, the, making, of, the, series, suggests, charles, williams, s, 1931, novel, the, place, of, the, lion, as, a, likely, influence, the, manuscript, for, the, lion, the, witch, and, the, wardrobe, was, complete, by, the, end, of, march, 1949, the, name, narnia, is, based, on, narni, italy, written, in, latin, as, narnia, green, wrote, when, walter, hooper, asked, where, he, found, the, word, narnia, lewis, showed, him, murray, s, small, classical, atlas, ed, g, b, grundy, 1904, which, he, acquired, when, he, was, reading, the, classics, with, mr, kirkpatrick, at, great, bookham, on, plate, 8, of, the, atlas, is, a, map, of, ancient, italy, lewis, had, underscored, the, name, of, a, little, town, called, narnia, simply, because, he, liked, the, sound, of, it, narnia, or, narni, in, italian, is, in, umbria, halfway, between, rome, and, assisi, the, chronicles, of, narnia, s, seven, books, have, been, in, continuous, publication, since, 1956, selling, over, 100,

as, it, is, known, throughout, the, series, but, allows, aslan, to, lead, the, characters, to, the, true, narnia, fans, of, the, series, often, have, strong, opinions, over, the, order, in, which, the, books, should, be, read, the, issue, revolves, around, the, placement, of, the, magician, s, nephew, and, the, horse, and, his, boy, in, the, series, both, are, set, significantly, earlier, in, the, story, of, narnia, than, their, publication, order, and, fall, somewhat, outside, the, main, story, arc, connecting, the, others, the, reading, order, of, the, other, five, books, is, not, disputed, when, first, published, the, books, were, not, numbered, the, first, american, publisher, macmillan, enumerated, them, according, to, their, original, publication, order, while, some, early, british, editions, specified, the, internal, chronological, order, when, harpercollins, took, over, the, series, rights, in, 1994, they, adopted, the, internal, chronological, order, to, make, the, case, for, the, internal, chronological, order, lewis, s, stepson, douglas, gresham, quoted, lewis, s, 1957, reply, to, a, letter, from, an, american, fan, who, was, having, an, argument, with, his, mother, about, the, order, in, the, 2005, harpercollins, adult, editions, of, the, books, the, publisher, cites, this, letter, to, assert, lewis, s, preference, for, the, numbering, they, adopted, by, including, this, notice, on, the, copyright, page, paul, ford, cites, several, scholars, who, have, weighed, in, against, this, view, and, continues, most, scholars, disagree, with, this, decision, and, find, it, the, least, faithful, to, lewis, s, deepest, intentions, scholars, and, readers, who, appreciate, the, original, order, believe, that, lewis, was, simply, being, gracious, to, his, youthful, correspondent, and, that, he, could, have, changed, the, books, order, in, his, lifetime, had, he, so, desired, they, maintain, that, much, of, the, magic, of, narnia, comes, from, the, way, the, world, is, gradually, presented, in, the, lion, the, witch, and, the, wardrobe, that, the, mysterious, wardrobe, as, a, narrative, device, is, a, much, better, introduction, to, narnia, than, the, magician, s, nephew, where, the, word, narnia, appears, in, the, first, paragraph, as, something, already, familiar, to, the, reader, moreover, they, say, it, is, clear, from, the, texts, themselves, that, the, lion, the, witch, and, the, wardrobe, was, intended, to, be, read, first, when, aslan, is, first, mentioned, in, the, lion, the, witch, and, the, wardrobe, for, example, the, narrator, says, that, none, of, the, children, knew, who, aslan, was, any, more, than, you, do, which, is, nonsensical, if, one, has, already, read, the, magician, s, nephew, other, similar, textual, examples, are, also, cited, doris, meyer, author, of, c, s, lewis, in, context, and, bareface, a, guide, to, c, s, lewis, s, last, novel, writes, that, rearranging, the, stories, chronologically, lessens, the, impact, of, the, individual, stories, and, obscures, the, literary, structures, as, a, whole, peter, schakel, devotes, an, entire, chapter, to, this, topic, in, his, book, imagination, and, the, arts, in, c, s, lewis, journeying, to, narnia, and, other, worlds, and, in, reading, with, the, heart, the, way, into, narnia, he, writes, aslan, the, great, lion, is, the, titular, lion, of, the, lion, the, witch, and, the, wardrobe, and, his, role, in, narnia, is, developed, throughout, the, remaining, books, he, is, also, the, only, character, to, appear, in, all, seven, books, aslan, is, a, talking, lion, the, king, of, beasts, son, of, the, emperor, over, the, sea, he, is, a, wise, compassionate, magical, authority, both, temporal, and, spiritual, who, serves, as, mysterious, and, benevolent, guide, to, the, human, children, who, visit, as, well, as, being, the, guardian, and, saviour, of, narnia, c, s, lewis, described, aslan, as, an, alternative, version, of, jesus, as, the, form, in, which, he, may, have, appeared, in, an, alternative, reality, in, his, book, miracles, c, s, lewis, argues, that, the, possible, existence, of, other, worlds, with, other, sentient, life, forms, should, not, deter, or, detract, from, being, christian, may, be, full, of, lives, that, have, been, redeemed, in, modes, suitable, to, their, condition, of, which, we, can, form, no, conception, it, may, be, full, of, lives, that, have, been, redeemed, in, the, very, same, mode, as, our, own, it, may, be, full, of, things, quite, other, than, life, in, which, god, is, interested, though, we, are, not, the, four, pevensie, siblings, are, the, main, human, protagonists, of, the, chronicles, of, narnia, varying, combinations, of, some, or, all, of, them, appear, in, five, of, the, seven, novels, they, are, introduced, in, the, lion, the, witch, and, the, wardrobe, although, their, surname, is, not, revealed, until, the, voyage, of, the, dawn, treader, and, eventually, become, kings, and, queens, of, narnia, reigning, as, a, tetrarchy, although, introduced, in, the, series, as, children, the, siblings, grow, up, into, adults, while, reigning, in, narnia, they, go, back, to, being, children, once, they, get, back, to, their, own, world, but, feature, as, adults, in, the, horse, and, his, boy, during, their, narnian, reign, all, four, appear, in, the,

and, edmund, appear, in, the, horse, and, his, boy, peter, is, said, to, be, away, fighting, giants, on, the, other, side, of, narnia, lucy, and, edmund, appear, in, the, voyage, of, the, dawn, treader, where, aslan, tells, them, too, that, they, are, getting, too, old, peter, edmund, and, lucy, appear, as, kings, and, queens, in, aslan, s, country, in, the, last, battle, susan, does, not, asked, by, a, child, in, 1958, if, he, would, please, write, another, book, entitled, susan, of, narnia, so, that, the, entire, pevensie, family, would, be, reunited, c, s, lewis, replied, i, am, so, glad, you, like, the, narnian, books, and, it, was, nice, of, you, to, write, and, tell, me, there, s, no, use, just, asking, me, to, write, more, when, stories, come, into, my, mind, i, have, to, write, them, and, when, they, don, t, i, can, t, lucy, is, the, youngest, of, the, four, pevensie, siblings, of, all, the, pevensie, children, lucy, is, the, closest, to, aslan, and, of, all, the, human, characters, who, visit, narnia, lucy, is, perhaps, the, one, who, believes, in, narnia, the, most, in, the, lion, the, witch, and, the, wardrobe, she, initiates, the, story, by, entering, narnia, through, the, wardrobe, and, with, susan, witnesses, aslan, s, execution, and, resurrection, she, is, named, queen, lucy, the, valiant, in, prince, caspian, she, is, the, first, to, see,

boy, she, helps, fight, the, calormenes, at, anvard, although, a, minor, character, in, the, last, battle, much, of, the, closing, chapter, is, seen, from, her, point, of, view, edmund, is, the, second, child, to, enter, narnia, in, the, lion, the, witch, and, the, wardrobe, where, he, falls, under, the, white, witch, s, spell, from, eating, the, turkish, delight, she, gives, him,

her, true, nature, and, her, evil, intentions, and, is, redeemed, by, the, sacrifice, of, aslan, s, life, he, is, named, king, edmund, the, just, in, prince, caspian, and, the, voyage, of, the, dawn,

childhood, game, though, lewis, mentioned, in, a, letter, to, a, fan, that, he, thought, she, may, eventually, believe, again, the, books, don, t, tell, us, what, happened, to, susan, but, there, is,

a, large, house, on, the, edge, of, belfast, its, long, hallways, and, empty, rooms, inspired, lewis, and, his, brother, to, invent, make, believe, worlds, whilst, exploring, their, home, an, activity, reflected, in, lucy, s, discovery, of, narnia, in, the, lion, the, witch, and, the, wardrobe, like, caspian, and, rilian, lewis, lost, his, mother, at, an, early, age, spending, much, of, his, youth, in, english, boarding, schools, similar, to, those, attended, by, the, pevensie, children, eustace, scrubb, and, jill, pole, during, world, war, ii, many, children, were, evacuated, from,

oxford, just, as, the, pevensies, stayed, with, the, professor, in, the, lion, the, witch, and, the, wardrobe, drew, trotter, president, of, the, center, for, christian, study, noted, that, the, producers, of, the, film, the, chronicles, of, narnia, the, lion, the, witch, and, the, wardrobe, felt, that, the, books, plots, adhere, to, the, archetypal, monomyth, pattern, as, detailed, in, joseph, campbell, s, the, hero, with, a, thousand, faces, lewis, was, widely, read, in, medieval, celtic, literature, an, influence, reflected, throughout, the, books, and, most, strongly, in, the, voyage, of, the, dawn, treader, the, entire, book, imitates, one, of, the, immrama, a, type, of, traditional, old, irish, tale, that, combines, elements, of, christianity, and, irish, mythology, to, tell, the, story, of, a, hero, s, sea, journey, to, the, otherworld, michael, ward, s, 2008, book, planet, narnia, proposes, that, each, of, the, seven, books, related, to, one, of, the, seven, moving, heavenly, bodies, or, planets, known, in, the, middle, ages, according, to, the, ptolemaic, geocentric, model, of, cosmology, a, theme, to, which, lewis, returned, habitually, throughout, his, work, at, that, time, each, of, these, heavenly, bodies, was, believed, to, have, certain, attributes, and, ward, contends, that, these, attributes, were, deliberately, but, subtly, used, by, lewis, to, furnish, elements, of, the, stories, of, each, book, lewis, s, interest, in, the, literary, symbolism, of, medieval, and, renaissance, astrology, is, more, overtly, referenced, in, other, works, such, as, his, study, of, medieval, cosmology, the, discarded, image, and, in, his, early, poetry, as, well, as, in, space, trilogy, narnia, scholar, paul, f, ford, finds, ward, s, assertion, that, lewis, intended, the, chronicles, to, be, an, embodiment, of, medieval, astrology, implausible, though, ford, addresses, an, earlier, 2003, version, of, ward, s, thesis, also, called, planet, narnia, published, in, the, times, literary, supplement, ford, argues, that, lewis, did, not, start, with, a, coherent, plan, for, the, books, but, ward, s, book, answers, this, by, arguing, that, the, astrological, associations, grew, in, the, writing, a, quantitative, analysis, on, the, imagery, in, the, different, books, of, the, chronicles, gives, mixed, support, to, ward, s, thesis, the, voyage, of, the, dawn, treader, the, silver, chair, the, horse, and, his, boy, and, the, magician, s, nephew, do, indeed, employ, concepts, associated, with, respectively, sol, luna, mercury, and, venus, far, more, often, than, chance, would, predict, but, the, lion, the, witch, and, the, wardrobe, prince, caspian, and, the, last, battle, fall, short, of, statistical, correlation, with, their, proposed, planets, george, macdonald, s, phantastes, 1858, influenced, the, structure, and, setting, of, the, chronicles, it, was, a, work, that, was, a, great, balm, to, the, soul, plato, was, an, undeniable, influence, on, lewis, s, writing, of, the, chronicles, most, clearly, digory, explicitly, invokes, plato, s, name, at, the, end, of, the, last, battle, to, explain, how, the, old, version, of, narnia, is, but, a, shadow, of, the, newly, revealed, true, narnia, plato, s, influence, is, also, apparent, in, the, silver, chair, when, the, queen, of, the, underland, attempts, to, convince, the, protagonists, that, the, surface, world, is, not, real, she, echoes, the, logic, of, plato, s, cave, by, comparing, the, sun, to, a, nearby, lamp, arguing, that, reality, is, only, that, which, is, perceived, in, the, immediate, physical, vicinity, the, white, witch, in, the, lion, the, witch, and, the, wardrobe, shares, many, features, both, of, appearance, and, character, with, the, villainous, duessa, of, edmund, spenser, s, faerie, queene, a, work, lewis, studied, in, detail, like, duessa, she, falsely, styles, herself, queen, she, leads, astray, the, erring, edmund, with, false, temptations, she, turns, people, into, stone, as, duessa, turns, them, into, trees, both, villains, wear, opulent, robes, and, deck, their, conveyances, out, with, bells, in, the, magician, s, nephew, jadis, takes, on, echoes, of, satan, from, john, milton, s, paradise, lost, she, climbs, over, the, wall, of, the, paradisal, garden, in, contempt, of, the, command, to, enter, only, by, the, gate, and, proceeds, to, tempt, digory, as, satan, tempted, eve, with, lies, and, half, truths, similarly, the, lady, of, the, green, kirtle, in, the, silver, chair, recalls, both, the, snake, woman, errour, in, the, faerie, queene, and, satan, s, transformation, into, a, snake, in, paradise, lost, lewis, read, edith, nesbit, s, children, s, books, as, a, child, and, was, greatly, fond, of, them, he, described, the, lion, the, witch, and, the, wardrobe, around, the, time, of, its, completion, as, a, children, s, book, in, the, tradition, of, e, nesbit, the, magician, s, nephew, in, particular, bears, strong, resemblances, to, nesbit, s, the, story, of, the, amulet, 1906, this, novel, focuses, on, four, children, living, in, london, who, discover, a, magic, amulet, their, father, is, away, and, their, mother, is, ill, as, is, the, case, with, digory, they, manage, to, transport, the, queen, of, ancient, babylon, to, london, and, she, is, the, cause, of, a, riot, likewise, polly, and, digory, transport, queen, jadis, to, london, sparking, a, very, similar, incident, marsha, daigle, williamson, argues, that, dante, s, divine, comedy, had, a, significant, impact, on, lewis, s, writings, in, the, narnia, series, she, identifies, this, influence, as, most, apparent, in, the, voyage, of, the, dawn, treader, and, the, silver, chair, daigle, williamson, identifies, the, plot, of, the, voyage, of, the, dawn, treader, as, a, dantean, journey, with, a, parallel, structure, and, similar, themes, she, likewise, draws, numerous, connections, between, the, silver, chair, and, the, events, of, dante, s, inferno, colin, duriez, writing, on, the, shared, elements, found, in, both, lewis, s, and, j, r, r, tolkien, s, works, highlights, the, thematic, similarities, between, tolkien, s, poem, imram, and, lewis, s, the, voyage, of, the, dawn, treader, the, chronicles, of, narnia, is, considered, a, classic, of, children, s, literature, the, chronicles, of, narnia, has, been, a, significant, influence, on, both, adult, and, children, s, fantasy, literature, in, the, post, world, war, ii, era, in, 1976, the, scholar, susan, cornell, poskanzer, praised, lewis, for, his, strangely, powerful, fantasies, poskanzer, argued, that, children, could, relate, to, narnia, books, because, the, heroes, and, heroines, were, realistic, characters, each, with, their, own, distinctive, voice, and, personality, furthermore, the, protagonists, become, powerful, kings, and, queens, who, decide, the, fate, of, kingdoms, while, the, adults, in, the, narnia, books, tended, to, be, buffoons, which, by, inverting, the, normal, order, of, things, was, pleasing, to, many, youngsters, however, poskanzer, criticized, lewis, for, what, she, regarded, as, scenes, of, gratuitous, violence, which, she, felt, were, upsetting, to, children, poskanzer, also, noted, lewis, presented, his, christian, message, subtly, enough, as, to, avoid, boring, children, with, overt, sermonizing, examples, include, philip, pullman, s, fantasy, series, his, dark, materials, is, seen, as, a, response, to, the, chronicles, pullman, is, a, self, described, atheist, who, wholly, rejects, the, spiritual, themes, that, permeate, the, chronicles, yet, his, series, nonetheless, addresses, many, of, the, same, issues, and, introduces, some, similar, character, types, including,

features, a, humorous, nerdcore, hip, hop, song, titled, chronicles, of, narnia, lazy, sunday, which, focuses, on, the, performers, plan, to, see, the, chronicles, of, narnia, the, lion, the, witch, and, the, wardrobe, at, a, cinema, it, was, described, by, slate, magazine, as, one, of, the, most, culturally, significant, saturday, night, live, skits, in, many, years, and, an, important, commentary, on, the, state, of, rap, swedish, christian, power, metal, band, narnia, whose, songs, are, mainly, about, the, chronicles, of, narnia, or, the, bible, feature, aslan, on, all, their, album, covers, the, song, further, up, further, in, from, the, album, room, to, roam, by, scottish, irish, folk, rock, band, the, waterboys, is, heavily, influenced, by, the, chronicles, of, narnia, the, title, is, taken, from, a, passage, in, the, last, battle, and, one, verse, of, the, song, describes, sailing, to, the, end, of, the, world, to, meet, a, king, similar, to, the, ending, of, voyage, of, the, dawn, treader, c, s, lewis, is, explicitly, acknowledged, as, an, influence, in, the, liner, notes, of, the, 1990, compact, disc, during, interviews, the, primary, creator, of, the, japanese, anime, and, gaming, series, digimon, has, said, that, he, was, inspired, and, influenced, by, the, chronicles, of, narnia, its, influence, extends, even, to, fan, fiction, under, the, pen, name, edonohana, rachel, manija, brown, wrote, no, reservations, narnia, which, imagined, anthony, bourdain, exploring, narnia, and, its, cuisine, in, the, style, of, his, no, reservations, tv, show, and, book, bourdain, himself, praised, the, fic, s, writing, and, frankly, a, bit, frightening, attention, to, detail, lewis, had, authored, a, number, of, works, on, christian, apologetics, and, other, literature, with, christian, based, themes, before, writing, the, narnia, books, the, character, aslan, is, widely, accepted, by, literary, academia, as, being, based, on, jesus, christ, lewis, did, not, initially, plan, to, incorporate, christian, theological, concepts, into, his, narnia, stories, lewis, maintained, that, the, narnia, books, were, not, allegorical, preferring, to, term, their, christian, aspects, a, supposition, the, chronicles, have, consequently, a, large, christian, following, and, are, widely, used, to, promote, christian, ideas, however, some, christians, object, that, the, chronicles, promote, soft, sell, paganism, and, occultism, due, to, recurring, pagan, imagery, and, themes, gertrude, ward, noted, that, when, lewis, wrote, the, lion, the, witch, and, the, wardrobe, he, clearly, meant, to, create, a, world, where, there, were, no, human, beings, at, all, as, the, titles, of, mr, tumnus, books, testify, in, this, world, human, beings, are, creatures, of, myth, while, its, common, daily, reality, includes, fauns, and, other, creatures, which, are, myth, in, our, world, this, worked, well, for, the, first, volume, of, the, series, but, for, later, volumes, lewis, thought, up, plots, which, required, having, more, human, beings, in, this, world, in, prince, caspian, he, still, kept, the, original, structure, and, explained, that, more, humans, had, arrived, from, our, world, at, a, later, time, overrunning, narnia, however, later, on, he, gave, in, and, changed, the, entire, concept, of, this, world, there, have, always, been, very, many, humans, in, this, world, and, narnia, is, just, one, very, special, country, with, a, lot, of, talking, animals, and, fauns, and, dwarves, etc, in, this, revised, world, with, a, great, human, empire, to, the, south, of, narnia, and, human, principality, just, next, door, the, white, witch, would, not, have, suspected, edmund, of, being, a, dwarf, who, shaved, his, beard, there, would, be, far, more, simple, and, obvious, explanations, for, his, origin, and, in, fact, in, this, revised, world, it, is, not, entirely, clear, why, were, the, four, pevensie, children, singled, out, for, the, thrones, of, narnia, over, so, many, other, humans, in, the, world, still, we, just, have, to, live, with, these, discrepancies, and, enjoy, each, narnia, book, on, its, own, merits, in, later, years, both, lewis, and, the, chronicles, have, been, criticised, often, by, other, authors, of, fantasy, fiction, for, gender, role, stereotyping, though, other, authors, have, defended, lewis, in, this, area, most, allegations, of, sexism, centre, on, the, description, of, susan, pevensie, in, the, last, battle, when, lewis, writes, that, susan, is, no, longer, a, friend, of, narnia, and, interested, in, nothing, nowadays, except, nylons, and, lipstick, and, invitations, philip, pullman, inimical, to, lewis, on, many, fronts, calls, the, narnia, stories, monumentally, disparaging, of, women, his, interpretation, of, the, susan, passages, reflects, this, view, susan, like, cinderella, is, undergoing, a, transition, from, one, phase, of, her, life, to, another, lewis, didn, t, approve, of, that, he, didn, t, like, women, in, general, or, sexuality, at, all, at, least, at, the, stage, in, his, life, when, he, wrote, the, narnia, books, he, was, frightened, and, appalled, at, the, notion, of, wanting, to, grow, up, in, fantasy, author, neil, gaiman, s, short, story, the, problem, of, susan, 2004, an, elderly, woman, professor, hastings, deals, with, the, grief, and, trauma, of, her, entire, family, s, death, in, a, train, crash, although, the, woman, s, maiden, name, is, not, revealed, details, throughout, the, story, strongly, imply, that, this, character, is, the, elderly, susan, pevensie, the, story, is, written, for, an, adult, audience, and, deals, with, issues, of, sexuality, and, violence, and, through, it, gaiman, presents, a, critique, of, lewis, s, treatment, of, susan, as, well, as, the, problem, of, evil, as, it, relates, to, punishment, and, salvation, lewis, supporters, cite, the, positive, roles, of, women, in, the, series, including, jill, pole, in, the, silver, chair, aravis, tarkheena, in, the, horse, and, his, boy, polly, plummer, in, the, magician, s, nephew, and, particularly, lucy, pevensie, in, the, lion, the, witch, and, the, wardrobe, alan, jacobs, an, english, professor, at, wheaton, college, asserts, that, lucy, is, the, most, admirable, of, the, human, characters, and, that, generally, the, girls, come, off, better, than, the, boys, throughout, the, series, jacobs, 2008, 259, in, her, contribution, to, the, chronicles, of, narnia, and, philosophy, karin, fry, an, assistant, professor, of, philosophy, at, the, university, of, wisconsin, stevens, point, notes, that, the, most, sympathetic, female, characters, in, the, chronicles, are, consistently, the, ones, who, question, the, traditional, roles, of, women, and, prove, their, worth, to, aslan, through, actively, engaging, in, the, adventures, just, like, the, boys, fry, goes, on, to, say, the, characters, have, positive, and, negative, things, to, say, about, both, male, and, female, characters, suggesting, an, equality, between, sexes, however, the, problem, is, that, many, of, the, positive, qualities, of, the, female, characters, seem, to, be, those, by, which, they, can, rise, above, their, femininity, the, superficial, nature, of, stereotypical, female, interests, is, condemned, nathan, ross, notes, that, much, of, the, plot, of, wardrobe, is, told, exclusively, from, the, point, of, view, of, susan, and, lucy, it, is, the, girls, who, witness, aslan, being, killed, and, coming, back, to, life, a, unique, experience, from, which, the, boys, are, excluded, throughout, going, through, many, highly, frightening, and, shocking, moments, susan, and, lucy, behave, with, grown, up, courage, and, responsibility, their, experiences, are, told, in, full, over, several, chapters, while, what, the, boys, do, at, the, same, time, preparing, an, army, and, going, into, battle, is, relegated, to, the, background, this, arrangement, of, material, clearly, implies, that, what, girls, saw, and, did, was, the, more, important, given, the, commonly, held, interpretation, that, aslan, is, jesus, christ, and, that, what, the, girls, saw, was, a, no, less, than, a, reenacting, of, the, crucifixion, this, order, of, priorities, makes, perfect, sense, taking, a, different, stance, altogether, monika, b, hilder, provides, a, thorough, examination, of, the, feminine, ethos, apparent, in, each, book, of, the, series, and, proposes, that, critics, tend, to, misread, lewis, s, representation, of, gender, as, she, puts, it, we, assume, that, lewis, is, sexist, when, he, is, in, fact, applauding, the, feminine, heroic, to, the, extent, that, we, have, not, examined, our, own, chauvinism, we, demean, the, feminine, qualities, and, extol, the, masculine, not, noticing, that, lewis, does, the, opposite, in, addition, to, sexism, pullman, and, others, have, also, accused, the, narnia, series, of, fostering, racism, over, the, alleged, racism, in, the, horse, and, his, boy, newspaper, editor, kyrie, o, connor, wrote, while, the, book, s, storytelling, virtues, are, enormous, you, don, t, have, to, be, a, bluestocking, of, political, correctness, to, find, some, of, this, fantasy, anti, arab, or, anti, eastern, or, anti, ottoman, with, all, its, stereotypes, mostly, played, for, belly, laughs, there, are, moments, you, d, like, to, stuff, this, story, back, into, its, closet, gregg, easterbrook, writing, in, the, atlantic, stated, that, the, calormenes, are, unmistakable, muslim, stand, ins, while, novelist, philip, hensher, raises, specific, concerns, that, a, reader, might, gain, the, impression, that, islam, is, a, satanic, cult, in, rebuttal, to, this, charge, at, an, address, to, a, c, s, lewis, conference, devin, brown, argued, that, there, are, too, many, dissimilarities, between, the, calormene, religion, and, islam, particularly, in, the, areas, of, polytheism, and, human, sacrifice, for, lewis, s, writing, to, be, regarded, as, critical, of, islam, nicholas, wanberg, has, argued, echoing, claims, by, mervyn, nicholson, that, accusations, of, racism, in, the, books, are, an, oversimplification, but, he, asserts, that, the, stories, employ, beliefs, about, human, aesthetics, including, equating, dark, skin, with, ugliness, that, have, been, traditionally, associated, with, racist, thought, critics, also, argue, whether, lewis, s, work, presents, a, positive, or, negative, view, of, colonialism, nicole, duplessis, favors, the, anticolonial, view, claiming, the, negative, effects, of, colonial, exploitations, and, the, themes, of, animals, rights, and, responsibility, to, the, environment, are, emphasized, in, lewis, s, construction, of, a, community, of, living, things, through, the, negative, examples, of, illegitimate, rulers, lewis, constructs, the, correct, relationship, between, humans, and, nature, providing, examples, of, rulers, like, caspian, who, fulfil, their, responsibilities, to, the, environment, clare, etcherling, counters, with, her, claim, that, those, illegitimate, rulers, are, often, very, dark, skinned, and, that, the, only, legitimate, rulers, are, those, sons, and, daughters, of, adam, and, eve, who, adhere, to, christian, conceptions, of, morality, and, stewardship, either, white, english, children, such, as, peter, or, narnians, who, possess, characteristics, valued, and, cultivated, by, the, british, such, as, caspian, various, books, from, the, chronicles, of, narnia, have, been, adapted, for,
