the, baroque, uk, b, r, k, b, rok, us, r, o, k, rohk, french, is, a, western, style, of, architecture, music, dance, painting, sculpture, poetry, and, other, arts, that, flourished, from, the, early, 17th, century, until, the, 1750s, it, followed, renaissance, art, and, mannerism, and, preceded, the, rococo, in, the, past, often, referred, to, as, late, baroque, and, neoclassical, styles, it, was, encouraged, by, the, catholic, church, as, a, means, to, counter, the, simplicity, and, austerity, of, protestant, architecture, art, and, music, though, lutheran, baroque, art, developed, in, parts, of, europe, as, well, the, baroque, style, used, contrast, movement, exuberant, detail, deep, color, grandeur, and, surprise, to, achieve, a, sense, of, awe, the, style, began, at, the, start, of, the, 17th, century, in, rome, then, spread, rapidly, to, the, rest, of, italy, france, spain, and, portugal, then, to, austria, southern, germany, and, poland, by, the, 1730s, it, had, evolved, into, an, even, more, flamboyant, style, called, rocaille, or, rococo, which, appeared, in, france, and, central, europe, until, the, mid, to, late, 18th, century, in, the, territories, of, the, spanish, and, portuguese, empires, including, the, iberian, peninsula, it, continued, together, with, new, styles, until, the, first, decade, of, the, 19th, century, in, the, decorative, arts, the, style, employs, plentiful, and, intricate, ornamentation, the, departure, from, renaissance, classicism, has, its, own, ways, in, each, country, but, a, general, feature, is, that, everywhere, the, starting, point, is, the, ornamental, elements, introduced, by, the, renaissance, the, classical, repertoire, is, crowded, dense, overlapping, loaded, in, order, to, provoke, shock, effects, new, motifs, introduced, by, baroque, are, the, cartouche, trophies, and, weapons, baskets, of, fruit, or, flowers, and, others, made, in, marquetry, stucco, or, carved, the, english, word, baroque, comes, directly, from, the, french, some, scholars, state, that, the, french, word, originated, from, the, portuguese, term, barroco, a, flawed, pearl, pointing, to, the, latin, verruca, wart, or, to, a, word, with, the, romance, suffix, ccu, common, in, pre, roman, iberia, other, sources, suggest, a, medieval, latin, term, used, in, logic, baroco, as, the, most, likely, source, in, the, 16th, century, the, medieval, latin, word, baroco, moved, beyond, scholastic, logic, and, came, into, use, to, characterise, anything, that, seemed, absurdly, complex, the, french, philosopher, michel, de, montaigne, 1533, 1592, helped, to, give, the, term, baroco, spelled, barroco, by, him, the, meaning, bizarre, uselessly, complicated, other, early, sources, associate, baroco, with, magic, complexity, confusion, and, excess, the, word, baroque, was, also, associated, with, irregular, pearls, before, the, 18th, century, the, french, baroque, and, portuguese, barroco, were, terms, often, associated, with, jewelry, an, example, from, 1531, uses, the, term, to, describe, pearls, in, an, inventory, of, charles, v, of, france, s, treasures, later, the, word, appears, in, a, 1694, edition, of, le, dictionnaire, de, l, acad, mie, fran, aise, which, describes, baroque, as, only, used, for, pearls, that, are, imperfectly, round, a, 1728, portuguese, dictionary, similarly, describes, barroco, as, relating, to, a, coarse, and, uneven, pearl, an, alternative, derivation, of, the, word, baroque, points, to, the, name, of, the, italian, painter, federico, barocci, 1528, 1612, in, the, 18th, century, the, term, began, to, be, used, to, describe, music, and, not, in, a, flattering, way, in, an, anonymous, satirical, review, of, the, premi, re, of, jean, philippe, rameau, s, hippolyte, et, aricie, in, october, 1733, which, was, printed, in, the, mercure, de, france, in, may, 1734, the, critic, wrote, that, the, novelty, in, this, opera, was, du, barocque, complaining, that, the, music, lacked, coherent, melody, was, unsparing, with, dissonances, constantly, changed, key, and, meter, and, speedily, ran, through, every, compositional, device, in, 1762, le, dictionnaire, de, l, acad, mie, fran, aise, recorded, that, the, term, could, figuratively, describe, something, irregular, bizarre, or, unequal, jean, jacques, rousseau, who, was, a, musician, and, composer, as, well, as, a, philosopher, wrote, in, the, encyclop, die, in, 1768, baroque, music, is, that, in, which, the, harmony, is, confused, and, loaded, with, modulations, and, dissonances, the, singing, is, harsh, and, unnatural, the, intonation, difficult, and, the, movement, limited, it, appears, that, term, comes, from, the, word, baroco, used, by, logicians, in, 1788, quatrem, re, de, quincy, defined, the, term, in, the, encyclop, die, m, thodique, as, an, architectural, style, that, is, highly, adorned, and, tormented, the, french, terms, style, baroque, and, musique, baroque, appeared, in, le, dictionnaire, de, l, acad, mie, fran, aise, in, 1835, by, the, mid, 19th, century, art, critics, and, historians, had, adopted, the, term, baroque, as, a, way, to, ridicule, post, renaissance, art, this, was, the, sense, of, the, word, as, used, in, 1855, by, the, leading, art, historian, jacob, burckhardt, who, wrote, that, baroque, artists, despised, and, abused, detail, because, they, lacked, respect, for, tradition, in, 1888, the, art, historian, heinrich, w, lfflin, published, the, first, serious, academic, work, on, the, style, renaissance, und, barock, which, described, the, differences, between, the, painting, sculpture, and, architecture, of, the, renaissance, and, the, baroque, the, baroque, style, of, architecture, was, a, result, of, doctrines, adopted, by, the, catholic, church, at, the, council, of, trent, in, 1545, 1563, in, response, to, the, protestant, reformation, the, first, phase, of, the, counter, reformation, had, imposed, a, severe, academic, style, on, religious, architecture, which, had, appealed, to, intellectuals, but, not, the, mass, of, churchgoers, the, council, of, trent, decided, instead, to, appeal, to, a, more, popular, audience, and, declared, that, the, arts, should, communicate, religious, themes, with, direct, and, emotional, involvement, similarly, lutheran, baroque, art, developed, as, a, confessional, marker, of, identity, in, response, to, the, great, iconoclasm, of, calvinists, baroque, churches, were, designed, with, a, large, central, space, where, the, worshippers, could, be, close, to, the, altar, with, a, dome, or, cupola, high, overhead, allowing, light, to, illuminate, the, church, below, the, dome, was, one, of, the, central, symbolic, features, of, baroque, architecture, illustrating, the, union, between, the, heavens, and, the, earth, the, inside, of, the, cupola, was, lavishly, decorated, with, paintings, of, angels, and, saints, and, with, stucco, statuettes, of, angels, giving, the, impression, to, those, below, of, looking, up, at, heaven, another, feature, of, baroque, churches, are, the, quadratura, trompe, l, il, paintings, on, the, ceiling, in, stucco, frames, either, real, or, painted, crowded, with, paintings, of, saints, and, angels, and, connected, by, architectural, details, with, the, balustrades, and, consoles, quadratura, paintings, of, atlantes, below, the, cornices, appear, to, be, supporting, the, ceiling, of, the, church, unlike, the, painted, ceilings, of, michelangelo, in, the, sistine, chapel, which, combined, different, scenes, each, with, its, own, perspective, to, be, looked, at, one, at, a, time, the, baroque, ceiling, paintings, were, carefully, created, so, the, viewer, on, the, floor, of, the, church, would, see, the, entire, ceiling, in, correct, perspective, as, if, the, figures, were, real, the, interiors, of, baroque, churches, became, more, and, more, ornate, in, the, high, baroque, and, focused, around, the, altar, usually, placed, under, the, dome, the, most, celebrated, baroque, decorative, works, of, the, high, baroque, are, the, chair, of, saint, peter, 1647, 1653, and, st, peter, s, baldachin, 1623, 1634, both, by, gian, lorenzo, bernini, in, st, peter, s, basilica, in, rome, the, baldequin, of, st, peter, is, an, example, of, the, balance, of, opposites, in, baroque, art, the, gigantic, proportions, of, the, piece, with, the, apparent, lightness, of, the, canopy, and, the, contrast, between, the, solid, twisted, columns, bronze, gold, and, marble, of, the, piece, with, the, flowing, draperies, of, the, angels, on, the, canopy, the, dresden, frauenkirche, serves, as, a, prominent, example, of, lutheran, baroque, art, which, was, completed, in, 1743, after, being, commissioned, by, the, lutheran, city, council, of, dresden, and, was, compared, by, eighteenth, century, observers, to, st, peter, s, in, rome, the, twisted, column, in, the, interior, of, churches, is, one, of, the, signature, features, of, the, baroque, it, gives, both, a, sense, of, motion, and, also, a, dramatic, new, way, of, reflecting, light, the, cartouche, was, another, characteristic, feature, of, baroque, decoration, these, were, large, plaques, carved, of, marble, or, stone, usually, oval, and, with, a, rounded, surface, which, carried, images, or, text, in, gilded, letters, and, were, placed, as, interior, decoration, or, above, the, doorways, of, buildings, delivering, messages, to, those, below, they, showed, a, wide, variety, of, invention, and, were, found, in, all, types, of, buildings, from, cathedrals, and, palaces, to, small, chapels, baroque, architects, sometimes, used, forced, perspective, to, create, illusions, for, the, palazzo, spada, in, rome, francesco, borromini, used, columns, of, diminishing, size, a, narrowing, floor, and, a, miniature, statue, in, the, garden, beyond, to, create, the, illusion, that, a, passageway, was, thirty, meters, long, when, it, was, actually, only, seven, meters, long, a, statue, at, the, end, of, the, passage, appears, to, be, life, size, though, it, is, only, sixty, centimeters, high, borromini, designed, the, illusion, with, the, assistance, of, a, mathematician, the, first, building, in, rome, to, have, a, baroque, fa, ade, was, the, church, of, the, ges, in, 1584, it, was, plain, by, later, baroque, standards, but, marked, a, break, with, the, traditional, renaissance, fa, ades, that, preceded, it, the, interior, of, this, church, remained, very, austere, until, the, high, baroque, when, it, was, lavishly, ornamented, in, rome, in, 1605, paul, v, became, the, first, of, series, of, popes, who, commissioned, basilicas, and, church, buildings, designed, to, inspire, emotion, and, awe, through, a, proliferation, of, forms, and, a, richness, of, colours, and, dramatic, effects, among, the, most, influential, monuments, of, the, early, baroque, were, the, fa, ade, of, st, peter, s, basilica, 1606, 1619, and, the, new, nave, and, loggia, which, connected, the, fa, ade, to, michelangelo, s, dome, in, the, earlier, church, the, new, design, created, a, dramatic, contrast, between, the, soaring, dome, and, the, disproportionately, wide, fa, ade, and, the, contrast, on, the, fa, ade, itself, between, the, doric, columns, and, the, great, mass, of, the, portico, in, the, mid, to, late, 17th, century, the, style, reached, its, peak, later, termed, the, high, baroque, many, monumental, works, were, commissioned, by, popes, urban, viii, and, alexander, vii, the, sculptor, and, architect, gian, lorenzo, bernini, designed, a, new, quadruple, colonnade, around, st, peter, s, square, 1656, to, 1667, the, three, galleries, of, columns, in, a, giant, ellipse, balance, the, oversize, dome, and, give, the, church, and, square, a, unity, and, the, feeling, of, a, giant, theatre, another, major, innovator, of, the, italian, high, baroque, was, francesco, borromini, whose, major, work, was, the, church, of, san, carlo, alle, quattro, fontane, or, saint, charles, of, the, four, fountains, 1634, 1646, the, sense, of, movement, is, given, not, by, the, decoration, but, by, the, walls, themselves, which, undulate, and, by, concave, and, convex, elements, including, an, oval, tower, and, balcony, inserted, into, a, concave, traverse, the, interior, was, equally, revolutionary, the, main, space, of, the, church, was, oval, beneath, an, oval, dome, painted, ceilings, crowded, with, angels, and, saints, and, trompe, l, il, architectural, effects, were, an, important, feature, of, the, italian, high, baroque, major, works, included, the, entry, of, saint, ignatius, into, paradise, by, andrea, pozzo, 1685, 1695, in, the, sant, ignazio, church, rome, and, the, triumph, of, the, name, of, jesus, by, giovanni, battista, gaulli, in, the, church, of, the, ges, in, rome, 1669, 1683, which, featured, figures, spilling, out, of, the, picture, frame, and, dramatic, oblique, lighting, and, light, dark, contrasts, the, style, spread, quickly, from, rome, to, other, regions, of, italy, it, appeared, in, venice, in, the, church, of, santa, maria, della, salute, 1631, 1687, by, baldassare, longhena, a, highly, original, octagonal, form, crowned, with, an, enormous, cupola, it, appeared, also, in, turin, notably, in, the, chapel, of, the, holy, shroud, 1668, 1694, by, guarino, guarini, the, style, also, began, to, be, used, in, palaces, guarini, designed, the, palazzo, carignano, in, turin, while, longhena, designed, the, ca, rezzonico, on, the, grand, canal, 1657, finished, by, giorgio, massari, with, decorated, with, paintings, by, giovanni, battista, tiepolo, a, series, of, massive, earthquakes, in, sicily, required, the, rebuilding, of, most, of, them, and, several, were, built, in, the, exuberant, late, baroque, or, rococo, style, the, catholic, church, in, spain, and, particularly, the, jesuits, were, the, driving, force, of, spanish, baroque, architecture, the, first, major, work, in, this, style, was, the, san, isidro, chapel, in, madrid, begun, in, 1643, by, pedro, de, la, torre, it, contrasted, an, extreme, richness, of, ornament, on, the, exterior, with, simplicity, in, the, interior, divided, into, multiple, spaces, and, using, effects, of, light, to, create, a, sense, of, mystery, the, santiago, de, compostela, cathedral, was, modernized, with, a, series, of, baroque, additions, beginning, at, the, end, of, the, 17th, century, starting, with, a, highly, ornate, bell, tower, 1680, then, flanked, by, two, even, taller, and, more, ornate, towers, called, the, obradorio, added, between, 1738, and, 1750, by, fernando, de, casas, novoa, another, landmark, of, the, spanish, baroque, is, the, chapel, tower, of, the, palace, of, san, telmo, in, seville, by, leonardo, de, figueroa, granada, had, only, been, conquered, from, the, moors, in, the, 15th, century, and, had, its, own, distinct, variety, of, baroque, the, painter, sculptor, and, architect, alonso, cano, designed, the, baroque, interior, of, granada, cathedral, between, 1652, and, his, death, in, 1657, it, features, dramatic, contrasts, of, the, massive, white, columns, and, gold, decor, the, most, ornamental, and, lavishly, decorated, architecture, of, the, spanish, baroque, is, called, churrigueresque, style, named, after, the, brothers, churriguera, who, worked, primarily, in, salamanca, and, madrid, their, works, include, the, buildings, on, salamanca, s, main, square, the, plaza, mayor, 1729, this, highly, ornamental, baroque, style, was, influential, in, many, churches, and, cathedrals, built, by, the, spanish, in, the, americas, other, notable, spanish, baroque, architects, of, the, late, baroque, include, pedro, de, ribera, a, pupil, of, churriguera, who, designed, the, real, hospicio, de, san, fernando, in, madrid, and, narciso, tom, who, designed, the, celebrated, el, transparente, altarpiece, at, toledo, cathedral, 1729, 1732, which, gives, the, illusion, in, certain, light, of, floating, upwards, the, architects, of, the, spanish, baroque, had, an, effect, far, beyond, spain, their, work, was, highly, influential, in, the, churches, built, in, the, spanish, colonies, in, latin, america, and, the, philippines, the, church, built, by, the, jesuits, for, the, college, of, san, francisco, javier, in, tepotzotl, n, with,

in, the, first, half, of, the, 18th, century, until, it, was, replaced, in, turn, by, classicism, the, princes, of, the, multitude, of, states, in, that, region, also, chose, baroque, or, rococo, for, their, palaces, and, residences, and, often, used, italian, trained, architects, to, construct, them, an, notable, example, is, the, st, nicholas, church, mal, strana, in, prague, 1704, 1755, built, by, christoph, dientzenhofer, and, his, son, kilian, ignaz, dientzenhofer, decoration, covers, all, of, walls, of, interior, of, the, church, the, altar, is, placed, in, the, nave, beneath, the,

and, the, interior, was, decorated, with, frescoes, and, with, stuccowork, in, the, tradition, of, the, wessobrunner, school, it, is, now, a, unesco, world, heritage, site, baroque, in, france, developed, quite, differently, from, the, ornate, and, dramatic, local, versions, of, baroque, from, italy, spain, and, the, rest, of, europe, it, appears, severe, more, detached, and, restrained, by, comparison, preempting, neoclassicism, and, the, architecture, of, the, enlightenment, unlike, italian, buildings, french, baroque, buildings, have, no, broken, pediments, or, curvilinear, fa, ades, even, religious, buildings, avoided, the, intense, spatial, drama, one, finds, in, the, work, of, borromini, the, style, is, closely, associated, with, the, works, built, for, louis, xiv, reign, 1643, 1715, and, because, of, this, it, is, also, known, as, the, louis, xiv, style, louis, xiv, invited, the, master, of, baroque, bernini, to, submit, a, design, for, the, new, east, wing, of, the, louvre, but, rejected, it, in, favor, of, a, more, classical, design, by, claude, perrault, and, louis, le, vau, the, main, architects, of, the, style, included, fran, ois, mansart, 1598, 1666, pierre, le, muet, church, of, val, de, gr, ce, 1645, 1665, and, louis, le, vau, vaux, le, vicomte, 1657, 1661, mansart, was, the, first, architect, to, introduce, baroque, styling, principally, the, frequent, use, of, an, applied, order, and, heavy, rustication, into, the, french, architectural, vocabulary, the, mansard, roof, was, not, invented, by, mansart, but, it, has, become, associated, with, him, as, he, used, it, frequently, the, major, royal, project, of, the, period, was, the, expansion, of, palace, of, versailles, begun, in, 1661, by, le, vau, with, decoration, by, the, painter, charles, le, brun, the, gardens, were, designed, by, andr, le, n, tre, specifically, to, complement, and, amplify, the, architecture, the, galerie, des, glaces, hall, of, mirrors, the, centerpiece, of, the, ch, teau, with, paintings, by, le, brun, was, constructed, between, 1678, and, 1686, mansart, completed, the, grand, trianon, in, 1687, the, chapel, designed, by, robert, de, cotte, was, finished, in, 1710, following, the, death, of, louis, xiv, louis, xv, added, the, more, intimate, petit, trianon, and, the, highly, ornate, theatre, the, fountains, in, the, gardens, were, designed, to, be, seen, from, the, interior, and, to, add, to, the, dramatic, effect, the, palace, was, admired, and, copied, by, other, monarchs, of, europe, particularly, peter, the, great, of, russia, who, visited, versailles, early, in, the, reign, of, louis, xv, and, built, his, own, version, at, peterhof, palace, near, saint, petersburg, between, 1705, and, 1725, baroque, architecture, in, portugal, lasted, about, two, centuries, the, late, seventeenth, century, and, eighteenth, century, the, reigns, of, john, v, and, joseph, i, had, increased, imports, of, gold, and, diamonds, in, a, period, called, royal, absolutism, which, allowed, the, portuguese, baroque, to, flourish, baroque, architecture, in, portugal, enjoys, a, special, situation, and, different, timeline, from, the, rest, of, europe, it, is, conditioned, by, several, political, artistic, and, economic, factors, that, originate, several, phases, and, different, kinds, of, outside, influences, resulting, in, a, unique, blend, often, misunderstood, by, those, looking, for, italian, art, find, instead, specific, forms, and, character, which, give, it, a, uniquely, portuguese, variety, another, key, factor, is, the, existence, of, the, jesuitical, architecture, also, called, plain, style, estilo, ch, o, or, estilo, plano, which, like, the, name, evokes, is, plainer, and, appears, somewhat, austere, the, buildings, are, single, room, basilicas, deep, main, chapel, lateral, chapels, with, small, doors, for, communication, without, interior, and, exterior, decoration, simple, portal, and, windows, it,

in, italy, through, the, commercial, and, cultural, relationships, of, italians, with, countries, of, the, balkan, peninsula, including, moldavia, and, wallachia, baroque, influences, arrive, to, eastern, europe, these, influences, were, not, very, strong, since, they, usually, take, place, in, architecture, and, stone, sculpted, ornaments, and, are, also, mixed, intensely, with, details, taken, from, byzantine, and, islamic, art, before, and, after, the, fall, of, the, byzantine, empire, all, the, art, of, wallachia, and, moldavia, was, primarily, influenced, by, that, of, constantinople, until, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, with, little, modifications, the, plans, of, churches, and, monasteries, the, murals, and, the, ornaments, carved, in, stone, remain, the, same, as, before, from, a, period, starting, with, the, reigns, of, matei, basarab, 1632, 1654, and, vasile, lupu, 1634, 1653, which, coincided, with, the, popularization, of, italian, baroque, new, ornaments, were, added, and, the, style, of, religious, furniture, changed, this, was, not, random, at, all, decorative, elements, and, principles, were, brought, from, italy, through, venice, or, through, the, dalmatian, regions, and, they, were, adopted, by, architects, and, craftsmen, from, the, east, the, window, and, door, frames, the, pisanie, with, dedication, the, tombstones, the, columns, and, railings, and, a, part, of, the, bronze, silver, or, wooden, furniture, received, a, more, important, role, than, the, one, they, had, before, they, existed, before, too, inspired, by, the, byzantine, tradition, but, they, gained, a, more, realist, look, showing, delicate, floral, motifs, the, relief, that, existed, before, too, became, more, accentuated, having, volume, and, consistency, before, this, period, reliefs, from, wallachia, and, moldavia, like, the, ones, from, the, east, had, only, two, levels, at, a, small, distance, one, from, the, other, one, at, the, surface, and, the, other, in, depth, big, flowers, maybe, roses, peonies, or, thistles, thick, leaves, of, acanthus, or, another, similar, plant, were, twisting, on, columns, or, surround, door, and, windows, a, place, where, the, baroque, had, a, strong, influence, was, columns, and, the, railings, capitals, were, more, decorated, than, before, with, foliage, columns, have, often, twisting, shafts, a, local, reinterpretation, of, the, solomonic, column, maximalist, railings, are, placed, between, these, columns, decorated, with, rinceaux, some, of, the, ones, from, the, mogo, oaia, palace, are, also, decorated, with, dolphins, cartouches, are, also, used, sometimes, mostly, on, tombstones, like, on, the, one, of, constantin, br, ncoveanu, this, movement, is, known, as, the, br, ncovenesc, style, after, constantin, br, ncoveanu, a, ruler, of, wallachia, whose, reign, 1654, 1714, is, highly, associated, with, this, kind, of, architecture, and, design, the, style, is, also, present, during, the, 18th, century, and, in, a, part, of, the, 19th, many, of, the, churches, and, residences, erected, by, boyards, and, voivodes, of, these, periods, are, br, ncovenesc, although, baroque, influences, can, be, clearly, seen, the, br, ncovenesc, style, takes, much, more, inspiration, from, the, local, tradition, as, the, 18th, century, passed, with, the, phanariot, members, of, prominent, greek, families, in, phanar, istanbul, reigns, in, wallachia, and, moldavia, baroque, influences, come, from, istanbul, too, they, came, before, too, during, the, 17th, century, but, with, the, phanariots, more, western, baroque, motifs, that, arrived, to, the, ottoman, empire, had, their, final, destination, in, present, day, romania, in, moldavia, baroque, elements, come, from, russia, too, where, the, influence, of, italian, art, was, strong, baroque, painters, worked, deliberately, to, set, themselves, apart, from, the, painters, of, the, renaissance, and, the, mannerism, period, after, it, in, their, palette, they, used, intense, and, warm, colours, and, particularly, made, use, of, the, primary, colours, red, blue, and, yellow, frequently, putting, all, three, in, close, proximity, they, avoided, the, even, lighting, of, renaissance, painting, and, used, strong, contrasts, of, light, and, darkness, on, certain, parts, of, the, picture, to, direct, attention, to, the, central, actions, or, figures, in, their, composition, they, avoided, the, tranquil, scenes, of, renaissance, paintings, and, chose, the, moments, of, the, greatest, movement, and, drama, unlike, the, tranquil, faces, of, renaissance, paintings, the, faces, in, baroque, paintings, clearly, expressed, their, emotions, they, often, used, asymmetry, with, action, occurring, away, from, the, centre, of, the, picture, and, created, axes, that, were, neither, vertical, nor, horizontal, but, slanting, to, the, left, or, right, giving, a, sense, of, instability, and, movement, they, enhanced, this, impression, of, movement, by, having, the, costumes, of, the, personages, blown, by, the, wind, or, moved, by, their, own, gestures, the, overall, impressions, were, movement, emotion, and, drama, another, essential, element, of, baroque, painting, was, allegory, every, painting, told, a, story, and, had, a, message, often, encrypted, in, symbols, and, allegorical, characters, which, an, educated, viewer, was, expected, to, know, and, read, early, evidence, of, italian, baroque, ideas, in, painting, occurred, in, bologna, where, annibale, carracci, agostino, carracci, and, ludovico, carracci, sought, to, return, the, visual, arts, to, the, ordered, classicism, of, the, renaissance, their, art, however, also, incorporated, ideas, central, the, counter, reformation, these, included, intense, emotion, and, religious, imagery, that, appealed, more, to, the, heart, than, to, the, intellect, another, influential, painter, of, the, baroque, era, was, michelangelo, merisi, da, caravaggio, his, realistic, approach, to, the, human, figure, painted, directly, from, life, and, dramatically, spotlit, against, a, dark, background, shocked, his, contemporaries, and, opened, a, new, chapter, in, the, history, of, painting, other, major, painters, associated, closely, with, the, baroque, style, include, artemisia, gentileschi, elisabetta, sirani, giovanna, garzoni, guido, reni, domenichino, andrea, pozzo, and, paolo, de, matteis, in, italy, francisco, de, zurbar, n, bartolom, esteban, murillo, and, diego, vel, zquez, in, spain, adam, elsheimer, in, germany, and, nicolas, poussin, and, georges, de, la, tour, in, france, though, poussin, spent, most, of, his, working, life, in, italy, poussin, and, de, la, tour, adopted, a, classical, baroque, style, with, less, focus, on, emotion, and, greater, attention, to, the, line, of, the, figures, in, the, painting, than, to, colour, peter, paul, rubens, was, the, most, important, painter, of, the, flemish, baroque, style, rubens, highly, charged, compositions, reference, erudite, aspects, of, classical, and, christian, history, his, unique, and, immensely, popular, baroque, style, emphasised, movement, colour, and, sensuality, which, followed, the, immediate, dramatic, artistic, style, promoted, in, the, counter, reformation, rubens, specialized, in, making, altarpieces, portraits, landscapes, and, history, paintings, of, mythological, and, allegorical, subjects, one, important, domain, of, baroque, painting, was, quadratura, or, paintings, in, trompe, l, il, which, literally, fooled, the, eye, these, were, usually, painted, on, the, stucco, of, ceilings, or, upper, walls, and, balustrades, and, gave, the, impression, to, those, on, the, ground, looking, up, were, that, they, were, seeing, the, heavens, populated, with, crowds, of, angels, saints, and, other, heavenly, figures, set, against, painted, skies, and, imaginary, architecture, in, italy, artists, often, collaborated, with, architects, on, interior, decoration, pietro, da, cortona, was, one, of, the, painters, of, the, 17th, century, who, employed, this, illusionist, way, of, painting, among, his, most, important, commissions, were, the, frescoes, he, painted, for, the, palazzo, barberini, 1633, 39, to, glorify, the, reign, of, pope, urban, viii, pietro, da, cortona, s, compositions, were, the, largest, decorative, frescoes, executed, in, rome, since, the, work, of, michelangelo, at, the, sistine, chapel, fran, ois, boucher, was, an, important, figure, in, the, more, delicate, french, rococo, style, which, appeared, during, the, late, baroque, period, he, designed, tapestries, carpets, and, theatre, decoration, as, well, as, painting, his, work, was, extremely, popular, with, madame, de, pompadour, the, mistress, of, king, louis, xv, his, paintings, featured, mythological, romantic, and, mildly, erotic, themes, in, the, hispanic, americas, the, first, influences, were, from, sevillan, tenebrism, mainly, from, zurbar, n, some, of, whose, works, are, still, preserved, in, mexico, and, peru, as, can, be, seen, in, the, work, of, the, mexicans, jos, ju, rez, and, sebasti, n, l, pez, de, arteaga, and, the, bolivian, melchor, p, rez, de, holgu, n, the, cusco, school, of, painting, arose, after, the, arrival, of, the, italian, painter, bernardo, bitti, in, 1583, who, introduced, mannerism, in, the, americas, it, highlighted, the, work, of, luis, de, ria, o, disciple, of, the, italian, angelino, medoro, author, of, the, murals, of, the, church, of, san, pedro, andahuaylillas,

the, italian, school, of, poetry, action, time, and, place, and, a, fourth, unity, of, aristotle, which, is, about, style, mixing, of, tragic, and, comic, elements, showing, different, types, of, verses, and, stanzas, upon, what, is, represented, although, lope, has, a, great, knowledge, of, the, plastic, arts, he, did, not, use, it, during, the, major, part, of, his, career, nor, in, theatre,

important, play, writers, in, golden, era, spain, their, works, known, for, their, subtle, intelligence, and, profound, comprehension, of, a, person, s, humanity, could, be, considered, a, bridge, between, lope, s, primitive, comedy, and, the, more, elaborate, comedy, of, calder, n, tirso, de, molina, is, best, known, for, two, works, the, convicted, suspicions, and, the, trickster, of,

from, architecture, music, and, painting, freeing, the, deception, that, is, in, the, lopesian, comedy, was, made, up, from, the, lack, of, scenery, and, engaging, the, dialogue, of, action, the, best, known, german, playwright, was, andreas, gryphius, who, used, the, jesuit, model, of, the, dutch, joost, van, den, vondel, and, pierre, corneille, there, was, also, johannes, velten, who,

significant, and, important, of, the, 17th, century, the, foremost, italian, baroque, tragedian, was, federico, della, valle, his, literary, activity, is, summed, up, by, the, four, plays, that, he,

tsardom, of, russia, the, development, of, the, russian, version, of, baroque, took, shape, only, in, the, second, half, of, the, 17th, century, primarily, due, to, the, initiative, of, tsar, alexis, of, russia, who, wanted, to, open, a, court, theatre, in, 1672, its, director, and, dramatist, was, johann, gottfried, gregorii, a, german, russian, lutheran, pastor, who, wrote, in, particular, a, 10, hour, play, the, action, of, artaxerxes, the, dramaturgy, of, symeon, of, polotsk, and, demetrius, of, rostov, became, key, contribution, to, the, russian, baroque, following, the, evolution, marked, from, spain, at, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, the, companies, of, comedians, essentially, transhumant, began, to, professionalize, with, professionalization, came, regulation, and, censorship, as, in, europe, the, theatre, oscillated, between, tolerance, and, even, government, protection, and, rejection, with, exceptions, or, persecution, by, the, church, the, theatre, was, useful, to, the, authorities, as, an, instrument, to, disseminate, the, desired, behavior, and, models, respect, for, the, social, order, and, the, monarchy, school, of, religious, dogma, the, corrales, were, administered, for, the, benefit, of, hospitals, that, shared, the, benefits, of, the, representations, the, itinerant, companies, or, of, the, league, who, carried, the, theatre, in,

for, companies, that, worked, stably, in, the, capitals, and, major, cities, one, of, their, main, sources, of, income, was, participation, in, the, festivities, of, the, corpus, christi, which, provided, them, with, not, only, economic, benefits, but, also, recognition, and, social, prestige, the, representations, in, the, viceregal, palace, and, the, mansions, of, the, aristocracy, where, they, represented, both, the, comedies, of, their, repertoire, and, special, productions, with, great, lighting, effects, scenery, and, stage, were, also, an, important, source, of, well, paid, and, prestigious, work, born, in, the, viceroyalty, of, new, spain, but, later, settled, in, spain, juan, ruiz, de, alarc, n, is, the, most, prominent, figure, in, the, baroque, theatre, of, new, spain, despite, his, accommodation, to, lope, de, vega, s, new, comedy, his, marked, secularism, his, discretion, and, restraint, and, a, keen, capacity, for, psychological, penetration, as, distinctive, features, of, alarc, n, against, his, spanish, contemporaries, have, been, noted, noteworthy, among, his, works, la, verdad, sospechosa, a, comedy, of, characters, that, reflected, his, constant, moralizing, purpose, the, dramatic, production, of, sor, juana, in, s, de, la, cruz, places, her, as, the, second, figure, of, the, spanish, american, baroque, theatre, it, is, worth, mentioning, among, her, works, the, auto, sacramental, el, divino, narciso, and, the, comedy, los, empe, os, de, una, casa, the, baroque, garden, also, known, as, the, jardin, la, fran, aise, or, french, formal, garden, first, appeared, in, rome, in, the, 16th, century, and, then, most, famously, in, france, in, the, 17th, century, in, the, gardens, of, vaux, le, vicomte, and, the, palace, of, versailles, baroque, gardens, were, built, by, kings, and, princes, in, germany, the, netherlands, austria, spain, poland, italy, and, russia, until, the, mid, 18th, century, when, they, began, to, be, remade, into, by, the, more, natural, english, landscape, garden, the, purpose, of, the, baroque, garden, was, to, illustrate, the, power, of, man, over, nature, and, the, glory, of, its, builder, baroque, gardens, were, laid, out, in, geometric, patterns, like, the, rooms, of, a, house, they, were, usually, best, seen, from, the, outside, and, looking, down, either, from, a, ch, teau, or, terrace, the, elements, of, a, baroque, garden, included, parterres, of, flower, beds, or, low, hedges, trimmed, into, ornate, baroque, designs, and, straight, lanes, and, alleys, of, gravel, which, divided, and, crisscrossed, the, garden, terraces, ramps, staircases, and, cascades, were, placed, where, there, were, differences, of, elevation, and, provided, viewing, points, circular, or, rectangular, ponds, or, basins, of, water, were, the, settings, for, fountains, and, statues, bosquets, or, carefully, trimmed, groves, or, lines, of, identical, trees, gave, the, appearance, of, walls, of, greenery, and, were, backdrops, for, statues, on, the, edges, the, gardens, usually, had, pavilions, orangeries, and, other, structures, where, visitors, could, take, shelter, from, the, sun, or, rain, baroque, gardens, required, enormous, numbers, of, gardeners, continual, trimming, and, abundant, water, in, the, later, part, of, the, baroque, period, the, formal, elements, began, to, be, replaced, with, more, natural, features, including, winding, paths, groves, of, varied, trees, left, to, grow, untrimmed, rustic, architecture, and, picturesque, structures, such, as, roman, temples, or, chinese, pagodas, as, well, as, secret, gardens, on, the, edges, of, the, main, garden, filled, with, greenery, where, visitors, could, read, or, have, quiet, conversations, by, the, mid, 18th, century, most, of, the, baroque, gardens, were, partially, or, entirely, transformed, into, variations, of, the, english, landscape, garden, besides, versailles, and, vaux, le, vicomte, celebrated, baroque, gardens, still, retaining, much, of, their, original, appearance, include, the, royal, palace, of, caserta, near, naples, nymphenburg, palace, and, augustusburg, and, falkenlust, palaces, br, hl, in, germany, het, loo, palace, netherlands, the, belvedere, palace, in, vienna, royal, palace, of, la, granja, de, san, ildefonso, spain, and, peterhof, palace, in, st, petersburg, russia, 16th, through, 19th, century, european, cities, witnessed, a, large, change, in, urban, design, and, planning, principals, that, reshaped, the, landscapes, and, built, environment, rome, paris, and, other, major, cities, were, transformed, to, accommodate, growing, populations, through, improvements, in, housing, transportation, and, public, services, throughout, this, time, the, baroque, style, was, in, full, swing, and, the, influences, of, elaborate, dramatic, and, artistic, architectural, styles, extended, into, the, urban, fabric, through, what, is, known, as, baroque, urban, planning, the, experience, of, living, and, walking, in, the, cities, aims, to, complement, the, emotions, of, the, baroque, style, this, style, of, planning, often, embraced, displaying, the, wealth, and, strength, of, the, ruling, powers, and, the, important, buildings, served, as, the, visual, and, symbolic, center, of, the, cities, the, replanning, of, the, city, of, rome, under, the, rule, of, pope, sixtus, v, revived, and, expanded, the, city, in, the, 16th, century, many, grand, piazzas, and, squares, were, added, as, public, spaces, to, contribute, to, the, dramatic, effect, of, the, baroque, style, the, piazzas, featured, fountains, and, other, decorative, features, to, embody, the, emotions, of, the, time, an, important, factor, in, baroque, style, planning, was, to, connect, churches, government, structures, and, piazzas, together, in, a, refined, network, of, axis, this, allowed, the, important, landmarks, of, the, catholic, church, to, become, the, focal, points, of, the, city, as, another, example, of, baroque, urban, planning, paris, was, in, desperate, need, for, an, urban, revival, in, the, 19th, century, the, city, underwent, a, dramatic, change, within, its, urban, fabric, through, the, help, of, baron, haussmann, under, the, rule, of, napoleon, iii, haussmann, was, appointed, to, reconstruct, paris, by, adding, a, new, network, of, streets, parks, trains, and, public, services, some, of, the, characteristics, of, haussmann, s, design, include, straight, wide, boulevards, lined, with, trees, and, short, access, to, parks, and, green, spaces, the, plan, highlights, some, important, buildings, such, as, the, paris, opera, house, more, characteristics, of, baroque, urban, planning, are, embodied, in, barcelona, the, eixample, district, designed, by, ildefons, cerd, showcases, wide, avenues, in, a, grid, system, with, a, few, diagonal, boulevards, the, intersections, are, unique, with, octagonal, blocks, which, provide, the, streets, with, great, visibility, and, light, many, works, in, this, district, come, from, architect, antoni, gaud, who, displays, a, unique, style, centered, in, the, eixample, district, design, is, the, sagrada, fam, lia, by, gaud, which, poses, great, significance, to, the, city, the, rococo, is, the, final, stage, of, the, baroque, and, in, many, ways, took, the, baroque, s, fundamental, qualities, of, illusion, and, drama, to, their, logical, extremes, beginning, in, france, as, a, reaction, against, the, heavy, baroque, grandeur, of, louis, xiv, s, court, at, the, palace, of, versailles, the, rococo, movement, became, associated, particularly, with, the, powerful, madame, de, pompadour, 1721, 1764, the, mistress, of, the, new, king, louis, xv, 1710, 1774, because, of, this, the, style, was, also, known, as, pompadour, although, it, s, highly, associated, with, the, reign, of, louis, xv, it, didn, t, appear, in, this, period, multiple, works, from, the, last, years, of, louis, xiv, s, reign, are, examples, of, early, rococo, the, name, of, the, movement, derives, from, the, french, rocaille, or, pebble, and, refers, to, stones, and, shells, that, decorate, the, interiors, of, caves, as, similar, shell, forms, became, a, common, feature, in, rococo, design, it, began, as, a, design, and, decorative, arts, style, and, was, characterized, by, elegant, flowing, shapes, architecture, followed, and, then, painting, and, sculpture, the, french, painter, with, whom, the, term, rococo, is, most, often, associated, is, jean, antoine, watteau, whose, pastoral, scenes, or, f, tes, galantes, dominate, the, early, part, of, the, 18th, century, there, are, multiple, similarities, between, rococo, and, baroque, both, styles, insist, on, monumental, forms, and, so, use, continuous, spaces, double, columns, or, pilasters, and, luxurious, materials, including, gilded, elements, there, also, noticeable, differences, rococo, designed, freed, themselves, from, the, adherence, to, symmetry, that, had, dominated, architecture, and, design, since, the, renaissance, many, small, objects, like, ink, pots, or, porcelain, figures, but, also, some, ornaments, are, often, asymmetrical, this, goes, hand, in, hand, with, the, fact, that, most, ornamentation, consisted, of, interpretation, of, foliage, and, sea, shells, not, as, many, classical, ornaments, inherited, from, the, renaissance, like, in, baroque, another, key, difference, is, the, fact, that, since, the, baroque, is, the, main, cultural, manifestation, of, the, spirit, of, the, counter, reformation, it, is, most, often, associated, with, ecclesiastical, architecture, in, contrast, the, rococo, is, mainly, associated, with, palaces, and, domestic, architecture, in, paris, the, popularity, of, the, rococo, coincided, with, the, emergence, of, the, salon, as, a, new, type, of, social, gathering, the, venues, for, which, were, often, decorated, in, this, style, rococo, rooms, were, typically, smaller, than, their, baroque, counterparts, reflecting, a, movement, towards, domestic, intimacy, colours, also, match, this, change, from, the, earthy, tones, of, caravaggio, s, paintings, and, the, interiors, of, red, marble, and, gilded, mounts, of, the, reign, of, louis, xiv, to, the, pastel, and, relaxed, pale, blue, pompadour, pink, and, white, of, the, louis, xv, and, madame, de, pompadour, s, france, similarly, to, colours, there, was, also, a, transition, from, serious, dramatic, and, moralistic, subjects, in, painting, and, sculpture, to, lighthearted, and, joyful, themes, one, last, difference, between, baroque, and, rococo, is, the, interest, that, 18th, century, aristocrats, had, for, east, asia, chinoiserie, was, a, style, in, fine, art, architecture, and, design, popular, during, the, 18th, century, that, was, heavily, inspired, by, chinese, art, but, also, by, rococo, at, the, same, time, because, traveling, to, china, or, other, far, eastern, countries, was, hard, at, that, time, and, so, remained, mysterious, to, most, westerners, european, imagination, were, fuelled, by, perceptions, of, asia, as, a, place, of, wealth, and, luxury, and, consequently, patrons, from, emperors, to, merchants, vied, with, each, other, in, adorning, their, living, quarters, with, asian, goods, and, decorating, them, in, asian, styles, where, asian, objects, were, hard, to, obtain, european, craftsmen, and, painters, stepped, up, to, fill, the, demand, creating, a, blend, of, rococo, forms, and, asian, figures, motifs, and, techniques, aside, from, european, recreations, of, objects, in, east, asian, style, chinese, lacquerware, was, reused, in, multiple, ways, european, aristocrats, fully, decorated, a, handful, of, rooms, of, palaces, with, chinese, lacquer, panels, used, as, wall, panels, due, to, its, aspect, black, lacquer, was, popular, for, western, men, s, studies, those, panels, used, were, usually, glossy, and, black, made, in, the, henan, province, of, china, they, were, made, of, multiple, layers, of, lacquer, then, incised, with, motifs, in, filled, with, colour, and, gold, chinese, but, also, japanese, lacquer, panels, were, also, used, by, some, 18th, century, european, carpenters, for, making, furniture, in, order, to, be, produced, asian, screens, were, dismantled, and, used, to, veneer, european, made, furniture, the, pioneer, german, art, historian, and, archeologist, johann, joachim, winckelmann, also, condemned, the, baroque, style, and, praised, the, superior, values, of, classical, art, and, architecture, by, the, 19th, century, baroque, was, a, target, for, ridicule, and, criticism, the, neoclassical, critic, francesco, milizia, wrote, borrominini, in, architecture, bernini, in, sculpture, pietro, da, cortona, in, painting, are, a, plague, on, good, taste, which, infected, a, large, number, of, artists, in, the, 19th, century, criticism, went, even, further, the, british, critic, john, ruskin, declared, that, baroque, sculpture, was, not, only, bad, but, also, morally, corrupt, the, swiss, born, art, historian, heinrich, w, lfflin, 1864, 1945, started, the, rehabilitation, of, the, word, baroque, in, his, renaissance, und, barock, 1888, w, lfflin, identified, the, baroque, as, movement, imported, into, mass, an, art, antithetic, to, renaissance, art, he, did, not, make, the, distinctions, between, mannerism, and, baroque, that, modern, writers, do, and, he, ignored, the, later, phase, the, academic, baroque, that, lasted, into, the, 18th, century, baroque, art, and, architecture, became, fashionable, in, the, interwar, period, and, has, largely, remained, in, critical, favor, the, term, baroque, may, still, be, used, often, pejoratively, describing, works, of, art, craft, or, design, that, are, thought, to, have, excessive, ornamentation, or, complexity, of, line, at, the, same, time, baroque, has, become, an, accepted, terms, for, various, trends, in, roman, art, and, roman, architecture, in, the, 2nd, and, 3rd, centuries, ad, which, display, some, of, the, same, characteristics, as, the, later, baroque, highly, criticized, the, baroque, would, later, be, a, source, of, inspiration, for, artists, architects, and, designers, during, the, 19th, century, through, romanticism, a, movement, that, developed, in, the, 18th, century, and, that, reached, its, peak, in, the, 19th, it, was, characterized, by, its, emphasis, on, emotion, and, individualism, as, well, as, glorification, of, the, past, and, nature, preferring, the, medieval, to, the, classical, a, mix, of, literary, religious, and, political, factors, prompted, late, 18th, and, 19th, century, british, architects, and, designers, to, look, back, to, the, middle, ages, for, inspiration, romanticism, is, the, reason, the, 19th, century, is, best, known, as, the, century, of, revivals, in, france, romanticism, was, not, the, key, factor, that, led, to, the, revival, of, gothic, architecture, and, design, vandalism, of, monuments, and, buildings, associated, with, the, ancien, r, gime, old, regime, happened, during, the, french, revolution, because, of, this, an, archaeologist, alexandre, lenoir, was, appointed, curator, of, the, petits, augustins, depot, where, sculptures, statues, and, tombs, removed, from, churches, abbeys, and, convents, had, been, transported, he, organized, the, museum, of, french, monuments, 1795, 1816, and, was, the, first, to, bring, back, the, taste, for, the, art, of, the, middle, ages, which, progressed, slowly, to, flourish, a, quarter, of, a, century, later, this, taste, and, revival, of, medieval, art, led, to, the, revival, of, other, periods, including, the, baroque, and, rococo, revivalism, started, with, themes, first, from, the, middle, ages, then, towards, the, end, of, the, reign, of, louis, philippe, i, 1830, 1848, from, the, renaissance, baroque, and, rococo, inspiration, was, more, popular, during, the, reign, of, napoleon, iii, 1852, 1870, and, continued, later, after, the, fall, of, the, second, french, empire, compared, to, how, in, england, architects, and, designers, saw, the, gothic, as, a, national, style, rococo, was, seen, as, one, of, the, most, representative, movements, for, france, the, french, felt, much, more, connected, to, the, styles, of, the, ancien, r, gime, and, napoleon, s, empire, than, to, the, medieval, or, renaissance, past, although, gothic, architecture, appeared, in, france, not, in, england, the, revivalism, of, the, 19th, century, led, in, time, to, eclecticism, mix, of, elements, of, different, styles, because, architects, often, revived, classical, styles, most, eclectic, buildings, and, designs, have, a, distinctive, look, besides, pure, revivals, the, baroque, was, also, one, of, the, main, sources, of, inspiration, for, eclecticism, the, coupled, column, and, the, giant, order, two, elements, widely, used, in, baroque, are, often, present, in, this, kind, of, 19th, and, early, 20th, century, buildings, eclecticism, was, not, limited, only, to, architecture, many, designs, from, the, second, empire, style, 1848, 1870, have, elements, taken, from, different, styles, little, furniture, from, the, period, escaped, its, three, most, prevalent, historicist, influences, which, are, sometimes, kept, distinct, and, sometimes, combined, the, renaissance, louis, xv, rococo, and, louis, xvi, styles, revivals, and, inspiration, also, came, sometimes, from, baroque, like, in, the, case, of, remakes, and, arabesques, that, imitate, boulle, marquetry, and, from, other, styles, like, gothic, renaissance, or, english, regency, the, belle, poque, was, a, period, that, begun, around, 1871, 1880, and, that, ended, with, the, outbreak, of, world, war, i, in, 1914, it, was, characterized, by, optimism, regional, peace, economic, prosperity, colonial, expansion, and, technological, scientific, and, cultural, innovations, eclecticism, reached, its, peak, in, this, period, with, beaux, arts, architecture, the, style, takes, its, name, from, the, cole, des, beaux, arts, in, paris, where, it, developed, and, where, many, of, the, main, exponents, of, the, style, studied, buildings, in, this, style, often, feature, ionic, columns, with, their, volues, on, the, corner, like, those, found, in, french, baroque, a, rusticated, basement, level, overall, simplicity, but, with, some, really, detailed, parts, arched, doors, and, an, arch, above, the, entrance, like, the, one, of, the, petit, palais, in, paris, the, style, aimed, for, a, baroque, opulence, through, lavishly, decorated, monumental, structures, that, evoked, louis, xiv, s, versailles, when, it, comes, to, the, design, of, the, belle, poque, all, furniture, from, the, past, was, admired, including, perhaps, contrary, to, expectations, the, second, empire, style, the, style, of, the, proceeding, period, which, remained, popular, until, 1900, in, the, years, around, 1900, there, was, a, gigantic, recapitulation, of, styles, of, all, countries, in, all, preceding, periods, everything, from, chinese, to, spanish, models, from, boulle, to, gothic, found, its, way, into, furniture, production, but, some, styles, were, more, appreciated, than, others, the, high, middle, ages, and, the, early, renaissance, were, especially, prized, exoticism, of, every, stripe, and, exuberant, rococo, designs, were, also, favoured, revivals, and, influence, of, the, baroque, faded, away, and, disappeared, with, art, deco, a, style, created, as, a, collective, effort, of, multiple, french, designers, to, make, a, new, modern, style, around, 1910, it, was, obscure, before, ww1, but, became, very, popular, during, the, interwar, period, being, heavily, associated, with, the, 1920s, and, the, 1930s, the, movement, was, a, blend, of, multiple, characteristics, taken, from, modernist, currents, from, the, 1900s, and, the, 1910s, like, the, vienna, secession, cubism, fauvism, primitivism, suprematism, constructivism, futurism, de, stijl, and, expressionism, besides, modernism, elements, taken, from, styles, popular, during, the, belle, poque, like, rococo, revival, neoclassicism, or, the, neo, louis, xvi, style, are, also, present, in, art, deco, the, proportions, volumes, and, structure, of, beaux, arts, architecture, before, ww1, is, present, in, early, art, deco, buildings, of, the, 1910s, and, 1920s, elements, taken, from, baroque, are, quite, rare, architects, and, designers, preferring, the, louis, xvi, style, at, the, end, of, the, interwar, period, with, the, rise, in, popularity, of, the, international, style, characterized, by, the, complete, lack, of, any, ornamentation, led, to, the, complete, abandonment, of, influence, and, revivals, of, the, baroque, multiple, international, style, architects, and, designers, but, also, modernist, artists, criticized, baroque, for, its, extravagance, and, what, they, saw, as, excess, ironically, this, was, just, at, the, same, time, as, the, critical, appreciation, of, the, original, baroque, was, reviving, strongly, appreciation, for, the, baroque, reappeared, with, the, rise, of, postmodernism, a, movement, that, questioned, modernism, the, status, quo, after, ww2, and, which, promoted, the, inclusion, of, elements, of, historic, styles, in, new, designs, and, appreciation, for, the, pre, modernist, past, specific, references, to, baroque, are, rare, since, postmodernism, often, included, highly, simplified, elements, that, were, quotations, of, classicism, in, general, like, pediments, or, columns, more, references, to, baroque, are, found, in, versace, ceramic, ware, and, fashion, decorated, with, maximalist, acanthus, rinceaux, very, similar, to, the, ones, found, in, italian, baroque, ornament, plates, and, in, boulle, work, but, also, similar, to, the, ones, found, on, empire, objects, especially, textiles, from, the, reign, of, napoleon, i
