dominated, the, literary, life, of, restoration, england, to, such, a, point, that, the, period, came, to, be, known, in, literary, circles, as, the, age, of, dryden, he, established, the, heroic, couplet, as, a, standard, form, of, english, poetry, dryden, s, greatest, achievements, were, in, satiric, verse, in, works, like, the, mock, heroic, macflecknoe, 1682, alexander, pope, 1688, 1744, was, heavily, influenced, by, dryden, and, often, borrowed, from, him, other, writers, in, the, 18th, century, were, equally, influenced, by, both, dryden, and, pope, prose, in, the, restoration, period, is, dominated, by, christian, religious, writing, but, the, restoration, also, saw, the, beginnings, of, two, genres, that, would, dominate, later, periods, fiction, and, journalism, religious, writing, often, strayed, into, political, and, economic, writing, just, as, political, and, economic, writing, implied, or, directly, addressed, religion, the, restoration, was, also, the, time, when, john, locke, wrote, many, of, his, philosophical, works, his, two, treatises, on, government, which, later, inspired, the, thinkers, in, the, american, revolution, the, restoration, moderated, most, of, the, more, strident, sectarian, writing, but, radicalism, persisted, after, the, restoration, puritan, authors, such, as, john, milton, were, forced, to, retire, from, public, life, or, adapt, and, those, authors, who, had, preached, against, monarchy, and, who, had, participated, directly, in, the, regicide, of, charles, i, were, partially, suppressed, consequently, violent, writings, were, forced, underground, and, many, of, those, who, had, served, in, the, interregnum, attenuated, their, positions, in, the, restoration, john, bunyan, stands, out, beyond,

is, impossible, to, satisfactorily, date, the, beginning, of, the, novel, in, english, however, long, fiction, and, fictional, biographies, began, to, distinguish, themselves, from, other, forms, in, england, during, the, restoration, period, an, existing, tradition, of, romance, fiction, in, france, and, spain, was, popular, in, england, one, of, the, most, significant, figures, in, the, rise, of, the, novel, in, the, restoration, period, is, aphra, behn, author, of, oroonoko, 1688, who, was, not, only, the, first, professional, female, novelist, but, she, may, be, among, the, first, professional, novelists, of, either, sex, in, england, as, soon, as, the, previous, puritan, regime, s, ban, on, public, stage, representations, was, lifted, drama, recreated, itself, quickly, and, abundantly, the, most, famous, plays, of, the, early, restoration, period, are, the, unsentimental, or, hard, comedies, of, john, dryden, william, wycherley, and, george, etherege, which, reflect, the, atmosphere, at, court, and, celebrate, an, aristocratic, macho, lifestyle, of, unremitting, sexual, intrigue, and, conquest, after, a, sharp, drop, in, both, quality, and, quantity, in, the, 1680s, the, mid, 1690s, saw, a, brief, second, flowering, of, the, drama, especially, comedy, comedies, like, william, congreve, s, the, way, of, the, world, 1700, and, john, vanbrugh, s, the,

political, and, economic, issues, that, promoted, a, secular, view, of, the, world, and, a, general, sense, of, progress, and, perfectibility, led, by, the, philosophers, who, were, inspired, by, the, discoveries, of, the, previous, century, by, people, like, isaac, newton, and, the, writings, of, descartes, john, locke, and, francis, bacon, they, sought, to, discover, and, to, act, upon, universally, valid, principles, governing, humanity, nature, and, society, they, variously, attacked, spiritual, and, scientific, authority, dogmatism, intolerance, censorship, and, economic, and, social, restraints, they, considered, the, state, the, proper, and, rational, instrument, of, progress, the, extreme, rationalism, and, skepticism, of, the, age, led, naturally, to, deism, and, also,

might, they, instead, saw, in, it, a, reflection, of, ancient, rome, s, transition, from, rough, and, ready, literature, to, highly, political, and, highly, polished, literature, it, is, an, age, of, exuberance, and, scandal, of, enormous, energy, and, inventiveness, and, outrage, that, reflected, an, era, when, english, welsh, scottish, and, irish, people, found, themselves, in, the, midst, of, an, expanding, economy, lowering, barriers, to, education, and, the, beginnings, of, the, industrial, revolution, it, was, during, this, time, that, the, poet, james, thomson, 1700, 1748, produced, his, melancholy, the, seasons, 1728, 30, and, edward, young, 1681, 1765, wrote, his, poem, night, thoughts, 1742, though, the, most, outstanding, poet, of, the, age, is, alexander, pope, 1688, 1744, it, is, also, the, era, that, saw, a, serious, competition, over, the, proper, model, for, the, pastoral, in, criticism, poets, struggled, with, a, doctrine, of, decorum, of, matching, proper, words, with, proper, sense, and, of, achieving, a, diction, that, matched, the, gravity, of, a, subject, at, the, same, time, the, mock, heroic, was, at, its, zenith, and, pope, s, rape, of, the, lock, 1712, 17, and, the, dunciad, 1728, 43, are, still, considered, to, be, the, greatest, mock, heroic, poems, ever, written, pope, also, translated, the, iliad, 1715, 20, and, the, odyssey, 1725, 26, since, his, death, pope, has, been, in, a, constant, state, of, re, evaluation, drama, in, the, early, part, of, the, period, featured, the, last, plays, of, john, vanbrugh, and, william, congreve, both, of, whom, carried, on, the, restoration, comedy, with, some, alterations, however, the, majority, of, stagings, were, of, lower, farces, and, much, more, serious, and, domestic, tragedies, george, lillo, and, richard, steele, both, produced, highly, moral, forms, of, tragedy, where, the, characters, and, the, concerns, of, the, characters, were, wholly, middle, class, or, working, class, this, reflected, a, marked, change, in, the, audience, for, plays, as, royal, patronage, was, no, longer, the, important, part, of, theatrical, success, additionally, colley, cibber, and, john, rich, began,

from, journalism, and, writing, criminal, lives, for, the, press, to, writing, fictional, criminal, lives, with, roxana, and, moll, flanders, he, also, wrote, robinson, crusoe, 1719, if, addison, and, steele, were, dominant, in, one, type, of, prose, then, jonathan, swift, author, of, the, satire, gulliver, s, travels, was, in, another, in, a, modest, proposal, and, the, drapier, letters, swift, reluctantly, defended, the, irish, people, from, the, predations, of, colonialism, this, provoked, riots, and, arrests, but, swift, who, had, no, love, of, irish, roman, catholics, was, outraged, by, the, abuses, he, saw, an, effect, of, the, licensing, act, of, 1737, was, to, cause, more, than, one, aspiring, playwright, to, switch, over, to, writing, novels, henry, fielding, 1707, 1754, began, to, write, prose, satire, and, novels, after, his, plays, could, not, pass, the, censors, in, the, interim, samuel, richardson, 1689, 1761, had, produced, pamela, or, virtue, rewarded, 1740, and,

other, parts, of, the, english, speaking, world, the, romantic, period, was, one, of, major, social, change, in, england, and, wales, because, of, the, depopulation, of, the, countryside, and, the, rapid, development, of, overcrowded, industrial, cities, that, took, place, in, the, period, roughly, between, 1750, and, 1850, the, movement, of, so, many, people, in, england, was, the, result, of, two, forces, the, agricultural, revolution, that, involved, the, enclosure, of, the, land, drove, workers, off, the, land, and, the, industrial, revolution, which, provided, them, employment, romanticism, may, be, seen, in, part, as, a, reaction, to, the, industrial, revolution, though, it, was, also, a, revolt, against, aristocratic, social, and, political, norms, of, the, age, of, enlightenment, as, well, a, reaction, against, the, scientific, rationalization, of, nature, the, french, revolution, was, an, especially, important, influence, on, the, political, thinking, of, many, of, the, romantic, poets, the, landscape, is, often, prominent, in, the, poetry, of, this, period, so, much, so, that, the, romantics, especially, perhaps, wordsworth, are, often, described, as, nature, poets, however, the, longer, romantic, nature, poems, have, a, wider, concern, because, they, are, usually, meditations, on, an, emotional, problem, or, personal, crisis, robert, burns, 1759, 1796, was, a, pioneer, of, the, romantic, movement, and, after, his, death, he, became, a, cultural, icon, in, scotland, the, poet, painter, and, printmaker, william, blake, 1757, 1827, was, another, of, the, early, romantic, poets, though, blake, was, generally, unrecognised, during, his, lifetime, he, is, now, considered, a, seminal, figure, in, the, history, of, both, the, poetry, and, visual, arts, of, the, romantic, age, among, his, most, important, works, are, songs, of, innocence, 1789, and, songs, of, experience, 1794, and, profound, and, difficult, prophecies, such, as, jerusalem, the, emanation, of, the, giant, albion, 1804, c, 1820, after, blake, among, the, earliest, romantics, were, the, lake, poets, including, william, wordsworth, 1770, 1850, samuel, taylor, coleridge, 1772, 1834, robert, southey, 1774, 1843, and, journalist, thomas, de, quincey, 1785, 1859, however, at, the, time, walter, scott, 1771, 1832, was, the, most, famous, poet, in, 1784, with, elegiac, sonnets, charlotte, smith, 1749, 1806, reintroduced, the, sonnet, to, english, literature, the, early, romantic, poets, brought, a, new, emotionalism, and, introspection, and, their, emergence, is, marked, by, the, first, romantic, manifesto, in, english, literature, the, preface, to, lyrical, ballads, 1798, the, poems, in, lyrical, ballads, were, mostly, by, wordsworth, though, coleridge, contributed, rime, of, the, ancient, mariner, among, wordsworth, s, most, important, poems, are, lines, composed, a, few, miles, above, tintern, abbey, resolution, and, independence, ode, intimations, of, immortality, from, recollections, of, early, childhood, and, the, autobiographical, epic, the, prelude, robert, southey, 1774, 1843, was, another, of, the, so, called, lake, poets, and, poet,

confessions, of, an, english, opium, eater, 1821, essayist, william, hazlitt, 1778, 1830, friend, of, both, coleridge, and, wordsworth, is, best, known, today, for, his, literary, criticism,

1793, 1835, and, john, keats, 1795, 1821, byron, however, was, still, influenced, by, 18th, century, satirists, and, was, perhaps, the, least, romantic, of, the, three, preferring, the, brilliant, wit, of, pope, to, what, he, called, the, wrong, poetical, system, of, his, romantic, contemporaries, byron, achieved, enormous, fame, and, influence, throughout, europe, and, goethe, called, byron,
