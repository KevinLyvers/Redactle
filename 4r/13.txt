byzantine, architecture, is, the, architecture, of, the, byzantine, empire, or, eastern, roman, empire, usually, dated, from, 330, ad, when, constantine, the, great, established, a, new, roman, capital, in, byzantium, which, became, constantinople, until, the, fall, of, the, byzantine, empire, in, 1453, there, was, initially, no, hard, line, between, the, byzantine, and, roman, empires, and, early, byzantine, architecture, is, stylistically, and, structurally, indistinguishable, from, late, roman, architecture, the, style, continued, to, be, based, on, arches, vaults, and, domes, often, on, a, large, scale, wall, mosaics, with, gold, backgrounds, became, standard, for, the, grandest, buildings, with, frescos, a, cheaper, alternative, the, richest, interiors, were, finished, with, thin, plates, of, marble, or, coloured, and, patterned, stone, some, of, the, columns, were, also, made, of, marble, other, widely, used, materials, were, bricks, and, stone, mosaics, made, of, stone, or, glass, tesserae, were, also, elements, of, interior, architecture, precious, wood, furniture, like, beds, chairs, stools, tables, bookshelves, and, silver, or, golden, cups, with, beautiful, reliefs, decorated, byzantine, interiors, early, byzantine, architecture, drew, upon, earlier, elements, of, roman, and, greek, architecture, stylistic, drift, technological, advancement, and, political, and, territorial, changes, meant, that, a, distinct, style, gradually, resulted, in, the, greek, cross, plan, in, church, architecture, civil, architecture, continued, greco, roman, trends, the, byzantines, built, impressive, fortifications, and, bridges, but, generally, not, aqueducts, on, the, same, scales, as, the, romans, this, terminology, was, introduced, by, modern, historians, to, designate, the, medieval, roman, empire, as, it, evolved, as, a, distinct, artistic, and, cultural, entity, centered, on, the, new, capital, of, constantinople, modern, day, istanbul, rather, than, the, city, of, rome, and, its, environs, its, architecture, dramatically, influenced, the, later, medieval, architecture, throughout, europe, and, the, near, east, when, the, roman, empire, became, christian, after, having, extended, eastwards, with, its, new, capital, at, constantinople, its, architecture, became, more, sensuous, and, ambitious, this, new, style, with, exotic, domes, and, richer, mosaics, would, come, to, be, known, as, byzantine, before, it, traveled, west, to, ravenna, and, venice, and, as, far, north, as, moscow, most, of, the, churches, and, basilicas, have, high, riding, domes, which, created, vast, open, spaces, at, the, centers, of, churches, thereby, heightening, the, light, the, round, arch, is, a, fundamental, of, byzantine, style, magnificent, golden, mosaics, with, their, graphic, simplicity, brought, light, and, warmth, into, the, heart, of, churches, byzantine, capitals, break, away, from, the, classical, conventions, of, ancient, greece, and, rome, with, sinuous, lines, and, naturalistic, forms, which, are, precursors, to, the, gothic, style, in, the, same, way, the, parthenon, is, the, most, impressive, monument, for, classical, religion, hagia, sophia, remained, the, iconic, church, for, christianity, the, temples, of, these, two, religions, differ, substantially, from, the, point, of, view, of, their, interiors, and, exteriors, for, classical, temples, only, the, exterior, was, important, because, only, the, priests, entered, the, interior, where, the, statue, of, the, deity, to, whom, the, temple, was, dedicated, was, kept, the, ceremonies, were, held, outside, in, front, of, the, temple, instead, christian, liturgies, were, held, inside, the, churches, byzantine, columns, are, quite, varied, mostly, developing, from, the, classical, corinthian, with, the, ornamentation, undercut, with, drills, and, fluted, shafts, almost, entirely, abandoned, the, block, of, stone, was, left, rough, as, it, came, from, the, quarry, and, the, sculptor, evolved, new, designs, to, his, own, fancy, so, that, one, rarely, meets, with, many, repetitions, of, the, same, design, one, of, the, most, remarkable, designs, features, leaves, carved, as, if, blown, by, the, wind, the, finest, example, being, at, the, 7th, century, hagia, sophia, thessaloniki, those, in, the, cathedral, of, saint, mark, venice, 1071, specially, attracted, john, ruskin, s, fancy, others, appear, in, sant, apollinare, in, classe, ravenna, 549, the, column, in, san, vitale, ravenna, 547, shows, above, it, the, dosseret, required, to, carry, the, arch, the, springing, of, which, was, much, wider, than, the, abacus, of, the, column, on, eastern, columns, the, eagle, the, lion, and, the, lamb, are, occasionally, carved, but, treated, conventionally, there, are, two, types, of, columns, used, at, hagia, sophia, composite, and, ionic, the, composite, column, that, emerged, during, the, late, byzantine, empire, mainly, in, rome, combines, the, corinthian, with, the, ionic, composite, columns, line, the, principal, space, of, the, nave, ionic, columns, are, used, behind, them, in, the, side, spaces, in, a, mirror, position, relative, to, the, corinthian, or, composite, orders, as, was, their, fate, well, into, the, 19th, century, when, buildings, were, designed, for, the, first, time, with, a, monumental, ionic, order, at, hagia, sophia, though, these, are, not, the, standard, imperial, statements, the, columns, are, filled, with, foliage, in, all, sorts, of, variations, in, some, the, small, lush, leaves, appear, to, be, caught, up, in, the, spinning, of, the, scrolls, clearly, a, different, nonclassical, sensibility, has, taken, over, the, design, the, columns, at, basilica, of, san, vitale, show, wavy, and, delicate, floral, patterns, similar, to, decorations, found, on, belt, buckles, and, dagger, blades, their, inverted, pyramidal, form, has, the, look, of, a, basket, buildings, increased, in, geometric, complexity, brick, and, plaster, were, used, in, addition, to, stone, in, the, decoration, of, important, public, structures, classical, orders, were, used, more, freely, mosaics, replaced, carved, decoration, complex, domes, rested, upon, massive, piers, and, windows, filtered, light, through, thin, sheets, of, alabaster, to, softly, illuminate, interiors, most, of, the, surviving, structures, are, sacred, with, secular, buildings, having, been, destroyed, prime, examples, of, early, byzantine, architecture, date, from, the, emperor, justinian, i, s, reign, and, survive, in, ravenna, and, istanbul, as, well, as, in, sofia, the, church, of, st, sophia, one, of, the, great, breakthroughs, in, the, history, of, western, architecture, occurred, when, justinian, s, architects, invented, a, complex, system, providing, for, a, smooth, transition, from, a, square, plan, of, the, church, to, a, circular, dome, or, domes, by, means, of, pendentives, in, ravenna, the, longitudinal, basilica, of, sant, apollinare, nuovo, and, the, octagonal, centralized, structure, of, the, church, of, san, vitale, commissioned, by, emperor, justinian, but, never, seen, by, him, was, built, justinian, s, monuments, in, istanbul, include, the, domed, churches, of, hagia, sophia, and, hagia, irene, both, discussed, in, more, detail, below, but, there, is, also, an, earlier, smaller, church, of, saints, sergius, and, bacchus, locally, referred, to, as, little, hagia, sophia, which, might, have, served, as, a, model, for, both, in, that, it, combined, the, elements, of, a, longitudinal, basilica, with, those, of, a, centralized, building, other, structures, include, the, ruins, of, the, great, palace, of, constantinople, the, innovative, walls, of, constantinople, with, 192, towers, and, basilica, cistern, with, hundreds, of, recycled, classical, columns, a, mosaic, in, the, church, begun, by, the, ostrogoths, san, apollinare, in, nuovo, in, ravenna, depicts, an, early, byzantine, palace, hagios, demetrios, in, thessaloniki, saint, catherine, s, monastery, on, mount, sinai, jvari, monastery, in, present, day, georgia, and, three, armenian, churches, of, echmiadzin, all, date, primarily, from, the, 7th, century, and, provide, a, glimpse, on, architectural, developments, in, the, byzantine, provinces, following, the, age, of, justinian, remarkable, engineering, feats, include, the, 430, m, long, sangarius, bridge, the, pointed, arch, of, karamagara, bridge, as, well, as, the, dome, of, the, church, of, hagia, sophia, in, the, macedonian, dynasty, it, is, presumed, that, basil, i, s, votive, church, of, the, theotokos, of, the, pharos, and, the, nea, ekklesia, both, no, longer, existent, served, as, a, model, for, most, cross, in, square, sanctuaries, of, the, period, including, the, cattolica, di, stilo, in, southern, italy, 9th, century, the, monastery, church, of, hosios, lukas, in, greece, c, 1000, nea, moni, of, chios, a, pet, project, of, constantine, ix, and, the, daphni, monastery, near, athens, c, 1050, all, three, of, the, later, churches, display, the, important, shifts, in, architectural, design, that, occurred, following, the, end, of, iconoclasm, when, architectural, design, and, decoration, became, more, standardized, the, hagia, sophia, church, in, ochrid, present, day, north, macedonia, built, in, the, first, bulgarian, empire, in, the, time, of, boris, i, of, bulgaria, and, eponymous, cathedral, in, kiev, present, day, ukraine, testify, to, a, vogue, for, multiple, subsidiary, domes, set, on, drums, which, would, gain, in, height, and, narrowness, with, the, progress, of, time, in, istanbul, and, asia, minor, the, architecture, of, the, komnenian, period, is, almost, non, existent, with, the, notable, exceptions, of, the, elmali, kilise, and, other, rock, sanctuaries, of, cappadocia, and, of, the, churches, of, the, pantokrator, and, of, the, theotokos, kyriotissa, in, istanbul, most, examples, of, this, architectural, style, and, many, of, the, other, older, byzantine, styles, only, survive, on, the, outskirts, of, the, byzantine, world, as, most, significant, and, ancient, churches, and, buildings, were, in, asia, minor, during, world, war, i, almost, all, churches, that, ended, up, within, the, turkish, borders, were, destroyed, or, converted, into, mosques, some, were, abandoned, as, a, result, of, the, greek, and, christian, genocides, from, 1915, to, 1923, similar, styles, can, be, found, in, countries, such, as, bulgaria, croatia, north, macedonia, russia, serbia, and, other, slavic, lands, as, well, as, in, sicily, cappella, palatina, and, veneto, st, mark, s, basilica, torcello, cathedral, in, middle, byzantine, architecture, cloisonn, masonry, refers, to, walls, built, with, a, regular, mix, of, stone, and, brick, often, with, more, of, the, latter, the, exterior, of, the, 11th, or, 12th, century, pammakaristos, church, in, istanbul, is, an, example, though, it, is, even, more, renowned, for, late, byzantine, additions, discussed, below, the, paleologan, period, is, well, represented, in, a, dozen, former, churches, in, istanbul, notably, st, saviour, at, chora, and, st, mary, pammakaristos, unlike, their, slavic, counterparts, the, paleologan, architects, never, accented, the, vertical, thrust, of, structures, as, a, result, the, late, medieval, architecture, of, byzantium, barring, the, hagia, sophia, of, trebizond, is, less, prominent, in, height, the, church, of, the, holy, apostles, thessaloniki, is, cited, as, an, archetypal, structure, of, the, late, period, with, its, exterior, walls, intricately, decorated, with, complex, brickwork, patterns, or, with, glazed, ceramics, other, churches, from, the, years, immediately, predating, the, fall, of, constantinople, survive, on, mount, athos, and, in, mistra, e, g, brontochion, monastery, that, site, also, has, preserved, secular, architecture, such, as, the, palace, of, the, despots, and, several, houses, in, the, late, byzantine, period, c, 1310, a, highly, ornate, parekklesion, was, added, to, the, pammakaristos, church, in, constantinople, for, the, tomb, of, michael, glabas, tarchaniotes, a, byzantine, aristocrat, and, general, who, lived, c, 1235, to, c, 1305, 08, it, displays, the, attenuated, proportions, favored, in, the, late, byzantine, era, as, well, as, shifts, in, style, in, the, mosaics, treatment, of, figures, as, early, as, the, building, of, constantine, s, churches, in, palestine, there, were, two, chief, types, of, plan, in, use, the, basilican, or, axial, type, represented, by, the, basilica, at, the, holy, sepulchre, and, the, circular, or, central, type, represented, by, the, great, octagonal, church, once, at, antioch, those, of, the, latter, type, we, must, suppose, were, nearly, always, vaulted, for, a, central, dome, would, seem, to, furnish, their, very, purpose, the, central, space, was, sometimes, surrounded, by, a, very, thick, wall, in, which, deep, recesses, to, the, interior, were, formed, as, at, church, of, st, george, sofia, built, by, the, romans, in, the, 4th, century, as, a, cylindrical, domed, structure, built, on, a, square, base, and, the, noble, church, of, saint, george, thessaloniki, 5th, century, or, by, a, vaulted, aisle, as, at, santa, costanza, rome, 4th, century, or, annexes, were, thrown, out, from, the, central, space, in, such, a, way, as, to, form, a, cross, in, which, these, additions, helped, to, counterpoise, the, central, vault, as, at, the, mausoleum, of, galla, placidia, ravenna, 5th, century, the, most, famous, church, of, this, type, was, that, of, the, holy, apostles, constantinople, vaults, appear, to, have, been, early, applied, to, the, basilican, type, of, plan, for, instance, at, hagia, irene, constantinople, 6th, century, the, long, body, of, the, church, is, covered, by, two, domes, at, saint, sergius, constantinople, and, san, vitale, ravenna, churches, of, the, central, type, the, space, under, the, dome, was, enlarged, by, having, apsidal, additions, made, to, the, octagon, finally, at, hagia, sophia, 6th, century, a, combination, was, made, which, is, perhaps, the, most, remarkable, piece, of, planning, ever, contrived, a, central, space, of, 100, ft, 30, m, square, is, increased, to, 200, ft, 60, m, in, length, by, adding, two, hemicycles, to, it, to, the, east, and, the, west, these, are, again, extended, by, pushing, out, three, minor, apses, eastward, and, two, others, one, on, either, side, of, a, straight, extension, to, the, west, this, unbroken, area, about, 260, ft, 80, m, long, the, larger, part, of, which, is, over, 100, ft, 30, m, wide, is, entirely, covered, by, a, system, of, domical, surfaces, above, the, conchs, of, the, small, apses, rise, the, two, great, semi, domes, which, cover, the, hemicycles, and, between, these, bursts, out, the, vast, dome, over, the, central, square, on, the, two, sides, to, the, north, and, south, of, the, dome, it, is, supported, by, vaulted, aisles, in, two, stories, which, bring, the, exterior, form, to, a, general, square, at, the, holy, apostles, 6th, century, five, domes, were, applied, to, a, cruciform, plan, the, central, dome, was, the, highest, after, the, 6th, century, there, were, no, churches, built, which, in, any, way, competed, in, scale, with, these, great, works, of, justinian, and, the, plans, more, or, less, tended, to, approximate, to, one, type, the, central, area, covered, by, the, dome, was, included, in, a, considerably, larger, square, of, which, the, four, divisions, to, the, east, west, north, and, south, were, carried, up, higher, in, the, vaulting, and, roof, system, than, the, four, corners, forming, in, this, way, a, sort, of, nave, and, transepts, sometimes, the, central, space, was, square, sometimes, octagonal, or, at, least, there, were, eight, piers, supporting, the, dome, instead, of, four, and, the, nave, and, transepts, were, narrower, in, proportion, if, we, draw, a, square, and, divide, each, side, into, three, so, that, the, middle, parts, are, greater, than, the, others, and, then, divide, the, area, into, nine, from, these, points, we, approximate, to, the, typical, setting, out, of, a, plan, of, this, time, now, add, three, apses, on, the, east, side, opening, from, the, three, divisions, and, opposite, to, the, west, put, a, narrow, entrance, porch, running, right, across, the, front, still, in, front, put, a, square, court, the, court, is, the, atrium, and, usually, has, a, fountain, in, the, middle, under, a, canopy, resting, on, pillars, the, entrance, porch, is, the, narthex, directly, under, the, center, of, the, dome, is, the, ambo, from, which, the, scriptures, were, proclaimed, and, beneath, the, ambo, at, floor, level, was, the, place, for, the, choir, of, singers, across, the, eastern, side, of, the, central, square, was, a, screen, which, divided, off, the, bema, where, the, altar, was, situated, from, the, body, of, the, church, this, screen, bearing, images, is, the, iconostasis, the, altar, was, protected, by, a, canopy, or, ciborium, resting, on, pillars, rows, of, rising, seats, around, the, curve, of, the, apse, with, the, patriarch, s, throne, at, the, middle, eastern, point, formed, the, synthronon, the, two, smaller, compartments, and, apses, at, the, sides, of, the, bema, were, sacristies, the, diaconicon, and, prothesis, the, ambo, and, bema, were, connected, by, the, solea, a, raised, walkway, enclosed, by, a, railing, or, low, wall, the, continuous, influence, from, the, east, is, widely, shown, in, the, fashion, of, decorating, external, brick, walls, of, churches, built, about, the, 12th, century, in, which, bricks, roughly, carved, into, form, are, set, up, so, as, to, make, bands, of, ornamentation, which, it, is, quite, clear, are, imitated, from, cufic, writing, this, fashion, was, associated, with, the, disposition, of, the, exterior, brick, and, stone, work, generally, into, many, varieties, of, pattern, zig, zags, key, patterns, etc, and, as, similar, decoration, is, found, in, many, persian, buildings, it, is, probable, that, this, custom, also, was, derived, from, the, east, the, domes, and, vaults, to, the, exterior, were, covered, with, lead, or, with, tiling, of, regional, variety, the, window, and, door, frames, were, of, marble, the, interior, surfaces, were, adorned, all, over, by, mosaics, or, frescoes, in, the, higher, parts, of, the, edifice, and, below, with, incrustations, of, marble, slabs, which, were, frequently, of, very, beautiful, varieties, and, disposed, so, that, although, in, one, surface, the, coloring, formed, a, series, of, large, panels, the, better, marbles, were, opened, out, so, that, the, two, surfaces, produced, by, the, division, formed, a, symmetrical, pattern, ultimately, byzantine, architecture, in, the, west, gave, way, to, carolingian, romanesque, and, gothic, architecture, but, a, great, part, of, current, italy, used, to, belong, to, the, byzantine, empire, before, that, great, examples, of, byzantine, architecture, are, still, visible, in, ravenna, for, example, basilica, di, san, vitale, which, architecture, influenced, the, palatine, chapel, of, charlemagne, as, for, the, east, byzantine, architectural, tradition, exerted, a, profound, influence, on, early, islamic, architecture, particularly, umayyad, architecture, during, the, umayyad, caliphate, era, 661, 750, as, far, as, the, byzantine, impact, on, early, islamic, architecture, is, concerned, the, byzantine, arts, formed, a, fundamental, source, to, the, new, muslim, artistic, heritage, especially, in, syria, there, are, considerable, byzantine, influences, which, can, be, detected, in, the, distinctive, early, islamic, monuments, in, syria, 709, 715, while, these, give, clear, reference, in, plan, and, somewhat, in, decoration, to, byzantine, art, the, plan, of, the, umayyad, mosque, has, also, a, remarkable, similarity, with, 6th, and, 7th, century, christian, basilicas, but, it, has, been, modified, and, expanded, on, the, transversal, axis, and, not, on, the, normal, longitudinal, axis, as, in, the, christian, basilicas, the, tile, work, geometric, patterns, multiple, arches, domes, and, polychrome, brick, and, stone, work, that, characterize, muslim, and, moorish, architecture, were, influenced, heavily, by, byzantine, architecture, in, bulgaria, north, macedonia, serbia, romania, belarus, georgia, armenia, ukraine, russia, and, other, orthodox, countries, the, byzantine, architecture, persisted, even, longer, from, the, 16th, up, to, the, 18th, centuries, giving, birth, to, local, post, byzantine, schools, of, architecture, neo, byzantine, architecture, was, followed, in, the, wake, of, the, 19th, century, gothic, revival, resulting, in, such, jewels, as, westminster, cathedral, in, london, and, in, bristol, from, about, 1850, to, 1880, a, related, style, known, as, bristol, byzantine, was, popular, for, industrial, buildings, which, combined, elements, of, the, byzantine, style, with, moorish, architecture, it, was, developed, on, a, wide, scale, basis, in, russia, during, the, reign, of, alexander, ii, by, grigory, gagarin, and, his, followers, who, designed, st, volodymyr, s, cathedral, in, kiev, st, nicholas, naval, cathedral, in, kronstadt, alexander, nevsky, cathedral, in, sofia, saint, mark, s, church, in, belgrade, and, the, new, athos, monastery, in, new, athos, near, sukhumi, the, largest, neo, byzantine, project, of, the, 20th, century, was, the, church, of, saint, sava, in, belgrade, one, of, the, less, famous, byzantine, churches, is, hagia, irene, this, church, served, as, a, model, church, for, the, more, famous, church, hagia, sophia, construction, on, the, church, began, in, the, 4th, century, this, was, the, first, church, that, was, built, in, constantinople, but, due, to, its, location, it, was, severely, damaged, by, earthquakes, and, the, nika, riots, and, required, repair, several, times, the, hagia, irene, is, defined, by, its, large, atrium, and, is, in, fact, the, only, surviving, building, of, the, byzantine, empire, to, have, such, a, feature, hagia, irene, is, composed, mainly, of, three, materials, stone, brick, and, mortar, bricks, 70, cm, x, 35, cm, x, 5, cm, were, used, and, these, bricks, were, glued, together, using, mortar, approximately, 5, cm, thick, the, building, materials, chosen, for, the, construction, of, the, church, had, to, be, lightweight, durable, and, strong, volcanic, materials, were, chosen, for, this, purpose, as, volcanic, concrete, is, very, light, and, durable, perhaps, the, most, definite, feature, of, the, hagia, irene, is, the, strict, contrast, between, the, interior, and, exterior, design, while, the, plain, outside, composed, of, stone, and, brick, favors, functionality, the, interior, is, decorated, in, elaborate, mosaics, decorative, marble, and, in, some, places, covered, in, plaster, another, important, characteristic, of, the, church, include, two, domes, that, follow, one, behind, another, the, first, being, a, lower, oval, and, the, second, being, a, higher, semi, circle, throughout, history, hagia, irene, has, undergone, several, changes, there, were, multiple, repairs, due, to, the, nika, riots, and, earthquakes, when, the, ottomans, took, over, hagia, irene, they, repurposed, it, and, made, a, few, changes, but, none, as, drastic, as, what, was, done, to, hagia, sophia, today, hagia, irene, is, still, standing, and, open, to, visitors, as, a, museum, it, is, open, everyday, except, for, tuesdays, construction, of, hagia, irene, the, most, famous, example, of, byzantine, architecture, is, the, hagia, sophia, and, it, has, been, described, as, holding, a, unique, position, in, the, christian, world, and, as, an, architectural, and, cultural, icon, of, byzantine, and, eastern, orthodox, civilization, the, hagia, sophia, held, the, title, of, largest, church, in, the, world, until, the, ottoman, empire, sieged, the, byzantine, capital, after, the, fall, of, constantinople, the, church, was, used, by, the, muslims, for, their, religious, services, until, 1931, when, it, was, reopened, as, a, museum, in, 1935, translated, from, greek, the, name, hagia, sophia, means, holy, wisdom, the, construction, is, a, combination, of, longitudinal, and, central, structures, this, church, was, a, part, of, a, larger, complex, of, buildings, created, by, emperor, justinian, this, style, influenced, the, construction, of, several, other, buildings, such, as, st, peter, s, basilica, hagia, sophia, should, have, been, built, to, withstand, earthquakes, but, since, the, construction, of, hagia, sophia, was, rushed, this, technology, was, not, implemented, in, the, design, which, is, why, the, building, has, had, to, be, repaired, so, many, times, due, to, damages, from, the, earthquakes, the, dome, is, the, key, feature, of, hagia, sophia, as, the, domed, basilica, is, representative, of, byzantine, architecture, both, of, the, domes, collapsed, at, different, times, throughout, history, due, to, earthquakes, and, had, to, be, rebuilt, the, original,
