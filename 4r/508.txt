realism, in, the, arts, is, generally, the, attempt, to, represent, subject, matter, truthfully, without, artificiality, and, avoiding, speculative, and, supernatural, elements, the, term, is, often, used, interchangeably, with, naturalism, although, these, terms, are, not, synonymous, naturalism, as, an, idea, relating, to, visual, representation, in, western, art, seeks, to, depict, objects, with, the, least, possible, amount, of, distortion, and, is, tied, to, the, development, of, linear, perspective, and, illusionism, in, renaissance, europe, realism, while, predicated, upon, naturalistic, representation, and, a, departure, from, the, idealization, of, earlier, academic, art, often, refers, to, a, specific, art, historical, movement, that, originated, in, france, in, the, aftermath, of, the, french, revolution, of, 1848, with, artists, like, gustave, courbet, capitalizing, on, the, mundane, ugly, or, sordid, realism, was, motivated, by, the, renewed, interest, in, the, common, man, and, the, rise, of, leftist, politics, the, realist, painters, rejected, romanticism, which, had, come, to, dominate, french, literature, and, art, with, roots, in, the, late, 18th, century, in, 19th, century, europe, naturalism, or, the, naturalist, school, was, somewhat, artificially, erected, as, a, term, representing, a, breakaway, sub, movement, of, realism, that, attempted, not, wholly, successfully, to, distinguish, itself, from, its, parent, by, its, avoidance, of, politics, and, social, issues, and, liked, to, proclaim, a, quasi, scientific, basis, playing, on, the, sense, of, naturalist, as, a, student, of, natural, history, as, the, biological, sciences, were, then, generally, known, there, have, been, various, movements, invoking, realism, in, the, other, arts, such, as, the, opera, style, of, verismo, literary, realism, theatrical, realism, and, italian, neorealist, cinema, when, used, as, an, adjective, realistic, usually, related, to, visual, appearance, distinguishes, itself, from, realist, art, that, concerns, subject, matter, similarly, the, term, illusionistic, might, be, used, when, referring, to, the, accurate, rendering, of, visual, appearances, in, a, composition, in, painting, naturalism, is, the, precise, detailed, and, accurate, representation, in, art, of, the, appearance, of, scenes, and, objects, it, is, also, called, mimesis, or, illusionism, and, became, especially, marked, in, european, painting, in, the, early, netherlandish, painting, of, robert, campin, jan, van, eyck, and, other, artists, in, the, 15th, century, in, the, 19th, century, realism, art, movement, painters, such, as, gustave, courbet, were, not, especially, noted, for, fully, precise, and, careful, depiction, of, visual, appearances, in, courbet, s, time, that, was, more, often, a, characteristic, of, academic, painting, which, very, often, depicted, with, great, skill, and, care, scenes, that, were, contrived, and, artificial, or, imagined, historical, scenes, realism, or, naturalism, as, a, style, depicting, the, unidealized, version, of, the, subject, can, be, used, in, depicting, any, type, of, subject, without, commitment, to, treating, the, typical, or, every, day, despite, the, general, idealism, of, classical, art, this, too, had, classical, precedents, which, came, in, useful, when, defending, such, treatments, in, the, renaissance, and, baroque, demetrius, of, alopece, was, a, 4th, century, bce, sculptor, whose, work, all, now, lost, was, said, to, prefer, realism, over, ideal, beauty, and, during, the, ancient, roman, republic, politicians, preferred, a, truthful, depiction, in, portraits, though, the, early, emperors, favored, greek, idealism, goya, s, portraits, of, the, spanish, royal, family, represent, a, sort, of, honest, unflattering, portrayal, of, important, people, a, recurring, trend, in, christian, art, was, realism, that, emphasized, the, humanity, of, religious, figures, above, all, christ, and, his, physical, sufferings, in, his, passion, following, trends, in, devotional, literature, this, developed, in, the, late, middle, ages, where, some, painted, wooden, sculptures, in, particular, strayed, into, the, grotesque, in, portraying, christ, covered, in, wounds, and, blood, with, the, intention, of, stimulating, the, viewer, to, meditate, on, the, suffering, that, christ, had, undergone, on, their, behalf, these, were, especially, found, in, germany, and, central, europe, after, abating, in, the, renaissance, similar, works, re, appeared, in, the, baroque, especially, in, spanish, sculpture, renaissance, theorists, opened, a, debate, which, was, to, last, several, centuries, as, to, the, correct, balance, between, drawing, art, from, the, observation, of, nature, and, from, idealized, forms, typically, those, found, in, classical, models, or, the, work, of, other, artists, generally, some, admitted, the, importance, of, the, natural, but, many, believed, it, should, be, idealized, to, various, degrees, to, include, only, the, beautiful, leonardo, da, vinci, was, one, who, championed, the, pure, study, of, nature, and, wished, to, depict, the, whole, range, of, individual, varieties, of, forms, in, the, human, figure, and, other, things, leon, battista, alberti, was, an, early, idealizer, stressing, the, typical, with, others, such, as, michelangelo, supporting, the, selection, of, the, most, beautiful, he, refused, to, make, portraits, for, that, reason, in, the, 17th, century, the, debate, continued, in, italy, it, usually, centered, on, the, contrast, between, the, relative, classical, idealism, of, the, carracci, and, the, naturalist, style, of, the, caravaggisti, or, followers, of, caravaggio, who, painted, religious, scenes, as, though, set, in, the, back, streets, of, contemporary, italian, cities, and, used, naturalist, as, a, self, description, bellori, writing, some, decades, after, caravaggio, s, early, death, and, no, supporter, of, his, style, refers, to, those, who, glory, in, the, name, of, naturalists, naturalisti, during, the, 19th, century, naturalism, developed, as, a, broadly, defined, movement, in, european, art, though, it, lacked, the, political, underpinnings, that, motivated, realist, artists, the, originator, of, the, term, was, the, french, art, critic, jules, antoine, castagnary, who, in, 1863, announced, that, the, naturalist, school, declares, that, art, is, the, expression, of, life, under, all, phases, and, on, all, levels, and, that, its, sole, aim, is, to, reproduce, nature, by, carrying, it, to, its, maximum, power, and, intensity, it, is, truth, balanced, with, science, mile, zola, adopted, the, term, with, a, similar, scientific, emphasis, for, his, aims, in, the, novel, many, naturalist, paintings, covered, a, similar, range, of, subject, matter, as, that, of, impressionism, but, using, tighter, more, traditional, brushwork, styles, the, term, continued, to, be, used, indiscriminately, for, various, kinds, of, realism, for, several, decades, often, as, a, catch, all, term, for, art, that, was, outside, impressionism, and, later, movements, of, modernism, and, also, was, not, academic, art, the, later, periods, of, the, french, barbizon, school, and, the, d, sseldorf, school, of, painting, with, its, students, from, many, countries, and, 20th, century, american, regionalism, are, movements, that, are, often, also, described, as, naturalist, although, the, term, is, rarely, used, in, british, painting, some, recent, art, historians, claimed, either, courbet, or, the, impressionists, for, the, label, the, development, of, increasingly, accurate, representations, of, the, visual, appearances, of, things, has, a, long, history, in, art, it, includes, elements, such, as, the, accurate, depiction, of, the, anatomy, of, humans, and, animals, the, perspective, and, effects, of, distance, and, the, detailed, effects, of, light, and, color, the, art, of, the, upper, paleolithic, in, europe, achieved, remarkably, lifelike, depictions, of, animals, ancient, egyptian, art, developed, conventions, involving, both, stylization, and, idealization, ancient, greek, art, is, commonly, recognized, as, having, made, great, progress, in, the, representation, of, anatomy, no, original, works, on, panels, or, walls, by, the, great, greek, painters, survive, but, from, literary, accounts, and, the, surviving, corpus, of, derivative, works, mostly, graeco, roman, works, in, mosaic, illusionism, seems, to, be, highly, valued, in,

standards, of, illusionism, did, not, begin, to, be, reached, again, until, the, late, medieval, and, early, renaissance, periods, and, were, helped, first, in, the, netherlands, in, the, early, 15th, century, and, around, the, 1470s, in, italy, by, the, development, of, new, techniques, of, oil, painting, which, allowed, very, subtle, and, precise, effects, of, light, to, be, painted, using, several, layers, of, paint, and, glaze, scientific, methods, of, representing, perspective, were, developed, in, italy, in, the, early, 15th, century, and, gradually, spread, across, europe, with, accuracy, in, anatomy, rediscovered, under, the, influence, of, classical, art, as, in, classical, times, idealism, remained, the, norm, the, accurate, depiction, of, landscape, in, painting, had, also, been, developing, in, early, netherlandish, early, northern, renaissance, and, italian, renaissance, painting, and, was, then, brought, to, a, very, high, level, in, 17th, century, dutch, golden, age, painting, with, very, subtle, techniques, for, depicting, a, range, of, weather, conditions, and, degrees, of, natural, light, after, being, another, development, of, early, netherlandish, painting, 1600, european, portraiture, subjects, were, often, idealized, by, smoothing, features, or, giving, them, an, artificial, pose, still, life, paintings, and, still, life, elements, in, other, works, played, a, considerable, role, in, developing, illusionistic, painting, though, in, the, netherlandish, tradition, of, flower, painting, they, long, lacked, realism, in, that, flowers, from, all, seasons, were, typically, used, either, from, the, habit, of, assembling, compositions, from, individual, drawings, or, as, a, deliberate, convention, the, large, displays, of, bouquets, in, vases, were, atypical, of, 17th, century, habits, the, flowers, were, displayed, one, at, a, time, the, depiction, of, ordinary, everyday, subjects, in, art, also, has, a, long, history, though, it, was, often, squeezed, into, the, edges, of, compositions, or, shown, at, a, smaller, scale, this, was, partly, because, art, was, expensive, and, usually, commissioned, for, specific, religious, political, or, personal, reasons, which, allowed, only, a, relatively, small, amount, of, space, or, effort, to, be, devoted, to, such, scenes, drolleries, in, the, margins, of, medieval, illuminated, manuscripts, sometimes, contain, small, scenes, of, everyday, life, and, the, development, of, perspective, created, large, background, areas, in, many, scenes, set, outdoors, medieval, and, early, renaissance, art, usually, showed, non, sacred, figures, in, contemporary, dress, by, convention, early, netherlandish, painting, brought, the, painting, of, portraits, as, low, down, the, social, scale, as, the, prosperous, merchants, of, flanders, and, some, of, these, notably, the, arnolfini, portrait, by, jan, van, eyck, 1434, and, more, often, in, religious, scenes, such, as, the, merode, altarpiece, by, robert, campin, and, his, workshop, circa, 1427, include, very, detailed, depictions, of, middle, class, interiors, full, of, lovingly, depicted, objects, however, these, objects, are, at, least, largely, there, because, they, carry, layers, of, complex, significance, and, symbolism, that, undercut, any, commitment, to, realism, for, its, own, sake, cycles, of, the, labours, of, the, months, in, late, medieval, art, of, which, many, examples, survive, from, books, of, hours, concentrate, on, peasants, laboring, on, different, tasks, through, the, seasons, often, in, a, rich, landscape, background, and, were, significant, both, in, developing, landscape, art, and, the, depiction, of, everyday, working, class, people, in, the, 16th, century, there, was, a, fashion, for, the, depiction, in, large, paintings, of, scenes, of, people, working, especially, in, food, markets, and, kitchens, in, many, the, food, is, given, as, much, prominence, as, the, workers, artists, included, pieter, aertsen, and, his, nephew, joachim, beuckelaer, in, the, netherlands, working, in, an, essentially, mannerist, style, and, in, italy, the, young, annibale, carracci, in, the, 1580s, using, an, unpolished, style, with, bartolomeo, passerotti, somewhere, between, the, two, pieter, bruegel, the, elder, pioneered, large, panoramic, scenes, of, peasant, life, such, scenes, acted, as, a, prelude, for, the, popularity, of, scenes, of, work, in, genre, painting, in, the, 17th, century, which, appeared, all, over, europe, with, dutch, golden, age, painting, sprouting, several, different, subgenres, of, such, scenes, the, bamboccianti, though, mostly, from, the, low, countries, in, italy, and, in, spain, the, genre, of, bodegones, and, the, introduction, of, unidealized, peasants, into, history, paintings, by, jusepe, de, ribera, and, vel, zquez, the, le, nain, brothers, in, france, and, many, flemish, artists, including, adriaen, brouwer, and, david, teniers, the, elder, and, younger, painted, peasants, but, rarely, townsfolk, in, the, 18th, century, small, paintings, of, working, people, remained, popular, mostly, drawing, on, the, dutch, tradition, and, featuring, women, much, art, depicting, ordinary, people, especially, in, the, form, of, prints, was, comic, and, moralistic, but, the, mere, poverty, of, the, subjects, seems, relatively, rarely, to, have, been, part, of, the, moral, message, from, the, mid, 19th, century, onwards, the, difficulties, of, life, for, the, poor, were, emphasized, despite, this, trend, coinciding, with, large, scale, migration, from, the, countryside, to, cities, in, most, of, europe, painters, still, tended, to, paint, poor, rural, people, crowded, city, street, scenes, were, popular, with, the, impressionists, and, related, painters, especially, ones, showing, paris, medieval, manuscript, illuminators, were, often, asked, to, illustrate, technology, but, after, the, renaissance, such, images, continued, in, book, illustrations, and, prints, with, the, exception, of, marine, painting, which, largely, disappeared, in, fine, art, until, the, early, industrial, revolution, scenes, from, which, were, painted, by, a, few, painters, such, as, joseph, wright, of, derby, and, philip, james, de, loutherbourg, such, subjects, probably, failed, to, sell, very, well, and, there, is, a, noticeable, absence, of, industry, other, than, a, few, railway, scenes, in, painting, until, the, later, 19th, century, when, works, began, to, be, commissioned, typically, by, industrialists, or, for, institutions, in, industrial, cities, often, on, a, large, scale, and, sometimes, given, a, quasi, heroic, treatment, american, realism, a, movement, of, the, early, 20th, century, is, one, of, many, modern, movements, to, use, realism, in, this, sense, the, realist, movement, began, in, the, mid, 19th, century, as, a, reaction, to, romanticism, and, history, painting, in, favor, of, depictions, of, real, life, the, realist, painters, used, common, laborers, and, ordinary, people, in, ordinary, surroundings, engaged, in, real, activities, as, subjects, for, their, works, its, chief, exponents, were, gustave, courbet, jean, fran, ois, millet, honor, daumier, and, jean, baptiste, camille, corot, according, to, ross, finocchio, formerly, of, the, department, of, european, paintings, at, the, metropolitan, museum, of, art, realists, used, unprettified, detail, depicting, the, existence, of, ordinary, contemporary, life, coinciding, with, the, contemporaneous, naturalist, literature, of, mile, zola, honor, de, balzac, and, gustave, flaubert, the, french, realist, movement, had, equivalents, in, all, other, western, countries, developing, somewhat, later, in, particular, the, peredvizhniki, or, wanderers, group, in, russia, who, formed, in, the, 1860s, and, organized, exhibitions, from, 1871, included, many, realists, such, as, ilya, repin, vasily, perov, and, ivan, shishkin, and, had, a, great, influence, on, russian, art, in, britain, artists, such, as, hubert, von, herkomer, and, luke, fildes, had, great, success, with, realist, paintings, dealing, with, social, issues, broadly, defined, as, the, faithful, representation, of, reality, realism, as, a, literary, movement, is, based, on, objective, reality, it, focuses, on, showing, everyday, activities, and, life, primarily, among, the, middle, or, lower, class, society, without, romantic, idealization, or, dramatization, according, to, kornelije, kvas, the, realistic, figuration, and, re, figuration, of, reality, form, logical, constructs, that, are, similar, to, our, usual, notion, of, reality, without, violating, the, principle, of, three, types, of, laws, those, of, natural, sciences, psychological, and, social, ones, it, may, be, regarded, as, a, general, attempt, to, depict, subjects, as, they, are, considered, to, exist, in, third, person, objective, reality, without, embellishment, or, interpretation, and, in, accordance, with, secular, empirical, rules, as, such, the, approach, inherently, implies, a, belief, that, such, reality, is, ontologically, independent, of, humankind, s, conceptual, schemes, linguistic, practices, and, beliefs, and, thus, can, be, known, to, the, artist, who, can, in, turn, represent, this, reality, faithfully, as, ian, watt, states, modern, realism, begins, from, the, position, that, truth, can, be, discovered, by, the, individual, through, the, senses, and, as, such, it, has, its, origins, in, descartes, and, locke, and, received, its, first, full, formulation, by, thomas, reid, in, the, middle, of, the, eighteenth, century, while, the, preceding, romantic, era, was, also, a, reaction, against, the, values, of, the, industrial, revolution, realism, was, in, its, turn, a, reaction, to, romanticism, and, for, this, reason, it, is, also, commonly, derogatorily, referred, as, traditional, bourgeois, realism, some, writers, of, victorian, literature, produced, works, of, realism, the, rigidities, conventions, and, other, limitations, of, bourgeois, realism, prompted, in, their, turn, the, revolt, later, labeled, as, modernism, starting, around, 1900, the, driving, motive, of, modernist, literature, was, the, criticism, of, the, 19th, century, bourgeois, social, order, and, world, view, which, was, countered, with, an, anti, rationalist, anti, realist, and, anti, bourgeois, program, theatrical, realism, is, said, to, have, first, emerged, in, european, drama, in, the, 19th, century, as, an, offshoot, of, the, industrial, revolution, and, the, age, of, science, some, also, specifically, cited, the, invention, of, photography, as, the, basis, of, the, realist, theater, while, others, view, that, the, association, between, realism, and, drama, is, far, older, as, demonstrated, by, the, principles, of, dramatic, forms, such, as, the, presentation, of, the, physical, world, that, closely, matches, reality, the, achievement, of, realism, in, the, theatre, was, to, direct, attention, to, the, social, and, psychological, problems, of, ordinary, life, in, its, dramas, people, emerge, as, victims, of, forces, larger, than, themselves, as, individuals, confronted, with, a, rapidly, accelerating, world, these, pioneering, playwrights, present, their, characters, as, ordinary, impotent, and, unable, to, arrive, at, answers, to, their, predicaments, this, type, of, art, represents, what, we, see, with, our, human, eyes, anton, chekov, for, instance, used, camera, works, to, reproduce, an, uninflected, slice, of, life, scholars, such, as, thomas, postlewait, noted, that, throughout, the, nineteenth, and, twentieth, centuries, there, were, numerous, joining, of, melodramatic, and, realistic, forms, and, functions, which, could, be, demonstrated, in, the, way, melodramatic, elements, existed, in, realistic, forms, and, vice, versa, in, the, united, states, realism, in, drama, preceded, fictional, realism, by, about, two, decades, as, theater, historians, identified, the, first, impetus, toward, realism, during, the, late, 1870s, and, early, 1880s, its, development, is, also, attributed, to, william, dean, howells, and, henry, james, who, served, as, the, spokesmen, for, realism, as, well, as, articulator, of, its, aesthetic, principles, the, realistic, approach, to, theater, collapsed, into, nihilism, and, the, absurd, after, world, war, ii, italian, neorealism, was, a, cinematic, movement, incorporating, elements, of, realism, that, developed, in, post, wwii, italy, notable, neorealists, included, vittorio, de, sica, luchino, visconti, and, roberto, rossellini, realist, films, generally, focus, on, social, issues, there, are, two, types, of, realism, in, film, seamless, realism, and, aesthetic, realism, seamless, realism, tries, to, use, narrative, structures, and, film, techniques, to, create, a, reality, effect, to, maintain, its, authenticity, aesthetic, realism, which, was, first, called, for, by, french, filmmakers, in, the, 1930s, and, promoted, by, andre, bazin, in, the, 1950s, acknowledges, that, a, film, cannot, be, fixed, to, mean, what, it, shows, as, there, are, multiple, realisms, as, such, these, filmmakers, use, location, shooting, natural, light, and, non, professional, actors, to, ensure, the, viewer, can, make, up, her, his, own, choice, based, on, the, film, rather, than, being, manipulated, into, a, preferred, reading, siegfried, kracauer, is, also, notable, for, arguing, that, realism, is, the, most, important, function, of, cinema, aesthetically, realist, filmmakers, use, long, shots, deep, focus, and, eye, level, 90, degree, shots, to, reduce, manipulation, of, what, the, viewer, sees, italian, neorealism, filmmakers, from, after, wwii, took, the, existing, realist, film, approaches, from, france, and, italy, that, emerged, in, the, 1960s, and, used, them, to, create, a, politically, oriented, cinema, french, filmmakers, made, some, politically, oriented, realist, films, in, the, 1960s, such, as, the, cin, ma, v, rit, and, documentary, films, of, jean, rouch, while, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, british, french, and, german, new, waves, of, filmmaking, produced, slice, of, life, films, e, g, kitchen, sink, dramas, in, the, uk, verismo, was, a, post, romantic, operatic, tradition, associated, with, italian, composers, such, as, pietro, mascagni, ruggero, leoncavallo, umberto, giordano, francesco, cilea, and, giacomo, puccini, they, sought, to, bring, the, naturalism, of, influential, late, 19th, century, writers, such, as, mile, zola, gustave, flaubert, and, henrik, ibsen, into, opera, this, new, style, presented, true, to, life, drama, that, featured, gritty, and, flawed, lower, class, protagonists, while, some, described, it, as, a, heightened, portrayal, of, a, realistic, event, although, an, account, considered, giuseppe, verdi, s, luisa, miller, and, la, traviata, as, the, first, stirrings, of, the, verismo, some, claimed, that, it, began, in, 1890, with, the, first, performance, of, mascagni, s, cavalleria, rusticana, peaked, in, the, early, 1900s, it, was, followed, by, leoncavallo, s, pagliacci, which, dealt, with, the, themes, of, infidelity, revenge, and, violence, verismo, also, reached, britain, where, pioneers, included, the, victorian, era, theatrical, partnership, of, the, dramatist, w, s, gilbert, and, the, composer, arthur, sullivan, 1842, 1900, specifically, their, play, iolanthe, is, considered, a, realistic, representation, of, the, nobility, although, it, included, fantastical, elements
