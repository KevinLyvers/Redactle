a, design, is, the, concept, of, or, proposal, for, an, object, process, or, system, the, word, design, refers, to, something, that, is, or, has, been, intentionally, created, by, a, thinking, agent, and, is, sometimes, used, to, refer, to, the, inherent, nature, of, something, its, design, the, verb, to, design, expresses, the, process, of, developing, a, design, in, some, cases, the, direct, construction, of, an, object, without, an, explicit, prior, plan, may, also, be, considered, to, be, a, design, such, as, in, arts, and, crafts, a, design, is, expected, to, have, a, purpose, within, a, certain, context, usually, having, to, satisfy, certain, goals, and, constraints, and, to, take, into, account, aesthetic, functional, economic, environmental, or, socio, political, considerations, traditional, examples, of, designs, include, architectural, and, engineering, drawings, circuit, diagrams, sewing, patterns, and, less, tangible, artefacts, such, as, business, process, models, people, who, produce, designs, are, called, designers, the, term, designer, usually, refers, to, someone, who, works, professionally, in, one, of, the, various, design, areas, within, the, professions, the, word, designer, is, generally, qualified, by, the, area, of, practice, for, example, a, fashion, designer, a, product, designer, a, web, designer, or, an, interior, designer, but, it, can, also, designate, others, such, as, architects, and, engineers, see, below, types, of, designing, a, designer, s, sequence, of, activities, to, produce, a, design, is, called, a, design, process, with, some, employing, designated, processes, such, as, design, thinking, and, design, methods, the, process, of, creating, a, design, can, be, brief, a, quick, sketch, or, lengthy, and, complicated, involving, considerable, research, negotiation, reflection, modeling, interactive, adjustment, and, re, design, designing, is, also, a, widespread, activity, outside, of, the, professions, of, those, formally, recognized, as, designers, in, his, influential, book, the, sciences, of, the, artificial, the, interdisciplinary, scientist, herbert, a, simon, proposed, that, everyone, designs, who, devises, courses, of, action, aimed, at, changing, existing, situations, into, preferred, ones, according, to, the, design, researcher, nigel, cross, everyone, can, and, does, design, and, design, ability, is, something, that, everyone, has, to, some, extent, because, it, is, embedded, in, our, brains, as, a, natural, cognitive, function, the, study, of, design, history, is, complicated, by, varying, interpretations, of, what, constitutes, designing, many, design, historians, such, as, john, heskett, start, with, the, industrial, revolution, and, the, development, of, mass, production, others, subscribe, to, conceptions, of, design, that, include, pre, industrial, objects, and, artefacts, beginning, their, narratives, of, design, in, prehistorical, times, originally, situated, within, art, history, the, historical, development, of, the, discipline, of, design, history, coalesced, in, the, 1970s, as, interested, academics, worked, to, recognize, design, as, a, separate, and, legitimate, target, for, historical, research, early, influential, design, historians, include, german, british, art, historian, nikolaus, pevsner, and, swiss, historian, and, architecture, critic, sigfried, giedion, in, western, europe, institutions, for, design, education, date, back, to, the, nineteenth, century, the, norwegian, national, academy, of, craft, and, art, industry, was, founded, in, 1818, followed, by, the, united, kingdom, s, government, school, of, design, 1837, and, konstfack, in, sweden, 1844, the, rhode, island, school, of, design, was, founded, in, the, united, states, in, 1877, the, german, art, and, design, school, bauhaus, founded, in, 1919, greatly, influenced, modern, design, education, design, education, covers, the, teaching, of, theory, knowledge, and, values, in, the, design, of, products, services, and, environments, with, a, focus, on, the, development, of, both, particular, and, general, skills, for, designing, traditionally, its, primary, orientation, has, been, to, prepare, students, for, professional, design, practice, based, on, project, work, and, studio, or, atelier, teaching, methods, there, are, also, broader, forms, of, higher, education, in, design, studies, and, design, thinking, design, is, also, a, part, of, general, education, for, example, within, design, and, technology, the, development, of, design, in, general, education, in, the, 1970s, created, a, need, to, identify, fundamental, aspects, of, designerly, ways, of, knowing, thinking, and, acting, which, resulted, in, establishing, design, as, a, distinct, discipline, of, study, substantial, disagreement, exists, concerning, how, designers, in, many, fields, whether, amateur, or, professional, alone, or, in, teams, produce, designs, design, researchers, dorst, and, dijkhuis, acknowledged, that, there, are, many, ways, of, describing, design, processes, and, compare, and, contrast, two, dominant, but, different, views, of, the, design, process, as, a, rational, problem, solving, process, and, as, a, process, of, reflection, in, action, they, suggested, that, these, two, paradigms, represent, two, fundamentally, different, ways, of, looking, at, the, world, positivism, and, constructionism, the, paradigms, may, reflect, differing, views, of, how, designing, should, be, done, and, how, it, actually, is, done, and, they, both, have, a, variety, of, names, the, problem, solving, view, has, been, called, the, rational, model, technical, rationality, and, the, reason, centric, perspective, the, alternative, view, has, been, called, reflection, in, action, co, evolution, and, the, action, centric, perspective, the, rational, model, was, independently, developed, by, herbert, a, simon, an, american, scientist, and, two, german, engineering, design, theorists, gerhard, pahl, and, wolfgang, beitz, it, posits, that, the, rational, model, is, based, on, a, rationalist, philosophy, and, underlies, the, waterfall, model, systems, development, life, cycle, and, much, of, the, engineering, design, literature, according, to, the, rationalist, philosophy, design, is, informed, by, research, and, knowledge, in, a, predictable, and, controlled, manner, typical, stages, consistent, with, the, rational, model, include, the, following, each, stage, has, many, associated, best, practices, the, rational, model, has, been, widely, criticized, on, two, primary, grounds, the, action, centric, perspective, is, a, label, given, to, a, collection, of, interrelated, concepts, which, are, antithetical, to, the, rational, model, it, posits, that, the, action, centric, perspective, is, based, on, an, empiricist, philosophy, and, broadly, consistent, with, the, agile, approach, and, methodical, development, substantial, empirical, evidence, supports, the, veracity, of, this, perspective, in, describing, the, actions, of, real, designers, like, the, rational, model, the, action, centric, model, sees, design, as, informed, by, research, and, knowledge, at, least, two, views, of, design, activity, are, consistent, with, the, action, centric, perspective, both, involve, these, three, basic, activities, the, concept, of, the, design, cycle, is, understood, as, a, circular, time, structure, which, may, start, with, the, thinking, of, an, idea, then, expressing, it, by, the, use, of, visual, or, verbal, means, of, communication, design, tools, the, sharing, and, perceiving, of, the, expressed, idea, and, finally, starting, a, new, cycle, with, the, critical, rethinking, of, the, perceived, idea, anderson, points, out, that, this, concept, emphasizes, the, importance, of, the, means, of, expression, which, at, the, same, time, are, means, of, perception, of, any, design, ideas, philosophy, of, design, is, the, study, of, definitions, assumptions, foundations, and, implications, of, design, there, are, also, many, informal, philosophies, for, guiding, design, such, as, personal, values, or, preferred, approaches, some, of, these, values, and, approaches, include, the, boundaries, between, art, and, design, are, blurry, largely, due, to, a, range, of, applications, both, for, the, term, art, and, the, term, design, applied, arts, can, include, industrial, design, graphic, design, fashion, design, and, the, decorative, arts, which, traditionally, includes, craft, objects, in, graphic, arts, 2d, image, making, that, ranges, from, photography, to, illustration, the, distinction, is, often, made, between, fine, art, and, commercial, art, based, on, the, context, within, which, the, work, is, produced, and, how, it, is, traded
