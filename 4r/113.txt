haiku, listen, is, a, type, of, short, form, poetry, that, originated, in, japan, and, can, be, traced, back, from, the, influence, of, traditional, chinese, poetry, traditional, japanese, haiku, consist, of, three, phrases, composed, of, 17, phonetic, units, called, on, in, japanese, which, are, similar, to, syllables, in, a, 5, 7, 5, pattern, that, include, a, kireji, or, cutting, word, and, a, kigo, or, seasonal, reference, however, haiku, by, classical, japanese, poets, such, as, matsuo, bash, also, deviate, from, the, 17, on, pattern, and, sometimes, do, not, contain, a, kireji, similar, poems, that, do, not, adhere, to, these, rules, are, generally, classified, as, senry, haiku, originated, as, an, opening, part, of, a, larger, japanese, genre, of, poetry, called, renga, these, haiku, written, as, an, opening, stanza, were, known, as, hokku, and, over, time, they, began, to, be, written, as, stand, alone, poems, haiku, was, given, its, current, name, by, the, japanese, writer, masaoka, shiki, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, originally, from, japan, haiku, today, are, written, by, authors, worldwide, haiku, in, english, and, haiku, in, other, languages, have, different, styles, and, traditions, while, still, incorporating, aspects, of, the, traditional, haiku, form, non, japanese, language, haiku, vary, widely, on, how, closely, they, follow, traditional, elements, additionally, a, minority, movement, within, modern, japanese, haiku, gendai, haiku, supported, by, ogiwara, seisensui, and, his, disciples, has, varied, from, the, tradition, of, 17, on, as, well, as, taking, nature, as, their, subject, in, japanese, haiku, are, traditionally, printed, as, a, single, line, while, haiku, in, english, often, appear, as, three, lines, although, variations, exist, there, are, several, other, forms, of, japanese, poetry, related, to, haiku, such, as, tanka, as, well, as, other, art, forms, that, incorporate, haiku, such, as, haibun, and, haiga, in, japanese, haiku, a, kireji, or, cutting, word, typically, appears, at, the, end, of, one, of, the, verse, s, three, phrases, a, kireji, fills, a, role, analogous, to, that, of, a, caesura, in, classical, western, poetry, or, to, a, volta, in, sonnets, a, kireji, helps, mark, rhythmic, divisions, depending, on, which, kireji, is, chosen, and, its, position, within, the, verse, it, may, briefly, cut, the, stream, of, thought, suggesting, a, parallel, between, the, preceding, and, following, phrases, or, it, may, provide, a, dignified, ending, concluding, the, verse, with, a, heightened, sense, of, closure, the, kireji, lends, the, verse, structural, support, allowing, it, to, stand, as, an, independent, poem, the, use, of, kireji, distinguishes, haiku, and, hokku, from, second, and, subsequent, verses, of, renku, which, may, employ, semantic, and, syntactic, disjuncture, even, to, the, point, of, occasionally, end, stopping, a, phrase, with, a, sentence, ending, particle, sh, joshi, however, renku, typically, employ, kireji, in, english, since, kireji, have, no, direct, equivalent, poets, sometimes, use, punctuation, such, as, a, dash, or, ellipsis, or, an, implied, break, to, create, a, juxtaposition, intended, to, prompt, the, reader, to, reflect, on, the, relationship, between, the, two, parts, the, kireji, in, the, bash, examples, old, pond, and, the, wind, of, mt, fuji, are, both, ya, neither, the, remaining, bash, example, nor, the, issa, example, contain, a, kireji, however, they, do, both, balance, a, fragment, in, the, first, five, on, against, a, phrase, in, the, remaining, 12, on, it, may, not, be, apparent, from, the, english, translation, of, the, issa, that, the, first, five, on, mean, edo, s, rain, in, comparison, with, english, verse, typically, characterized, by, syllabic, meter, japanese, verse, counts, sound, units, known, as, on, or, morae, traditional, haiku, is, usually, fixed, verse, that, consists, of, 17, on, in, three, phrases, of, five, seven, and, five, on, respectively, among, modern, poems, traditionalist, haiku, continue, to, use, the, 5, 7, 5, pattern, while, free, form, haiku, do, not, however, one, of, the, examples, below, illustrates, that, traditional, haiku, masters, were, not, always, constrained, by, the, 5, 7, 5, pattern, either, the, free, form, haiku, was, advocated, for, by, ogiwara, seisensui, and, his, disciples, although, the, word, on, is, sometimes, translated, as, syllable, the, true, meaning, is, more, nuanced, one, on, in, japanese, is, counted, for, a, short, syllable, two, for, an, elongated, vowel, or, doubled, consonant, and, one, for, an, n, at, the, end, of, a, syllable, thus, the, word, haibun, though, counted, as, two, syllables, in, english, is, counted, as, four, on, in, japanese, ha, i, bu, n, and, the, word, on, itself, which, english, speakers, would, view, as, a, single, syllable, comprises, two, on, the, short, vowel, o, and, the, moraic, nasal, n, this, is, illustrated, by, the, issa, haiku, below, which, contains, 17, on, but, only, 15, syllables, conversely, some, sounds, such, as, kyo, may, look, like, two, syllables, to, english, speakers, but, are, in, fact, a, single, on, as, well, as, a, single, syllable, in, japanese, in, 1973, the, haiku, society, of, america, noted, that, the, norm, for, writers, of, haiku, in, english, was, to, use, 17, syllables, but, they, also, noted, a, trend, toward, shorter, haiku, according, to, the, society, about, 12, syllables, in, english, approximates, the, duration, of, 17, japanese, on, a, haiku, traditionally, contains, a, kigo, a, word, or, phrase, that, symbolizes, or, implies, the, season, of, the, poem, and, which, is, drawn, from, a, saijiki, an, extensive, but, prescriptive, list, of, such, words, season, words, are, evocative, of, images, that, are, associated, with, the, same, time, of, year, making, it, a, kind, of, logopoeia, kigo, are, not, always, included, in, non, japanese, haiku, or, by, modern, writers, of, japanese, free, form, haiku, one, of, the, best, known, japanese, haiku, is, matsuo, bash, s, old, pond, furu, ike, ya, kawazu, tobikomu, mizu, no, oto, translated, old, pond, frog, leaps, in, water, s, sound, this, separates, into, on, as, fu, ru, i, ke, ya, 5, ka, wa, zu, to, bi, ko, mu, 7, mi, zu, no, o, to, 5, another, haiku, by, bash, hatsu, shigure, saru, mo, komino, o, hoshige, nari, translated, the, first, cold, shower, even, the, monkey, seems, to, want, a, little, coat, of, straw, as, another, example, this, haiku, by, bash, illustrates, that, he, was, not, always, constrained, to, a, 5, 7, 5, on, pattern, it, contains, 18, on, in, the, pattern, 6, 7, 5, or, is, treated, as, two, on, fuji, no, kaze, ya, gi, ni, nosete, edo, miyage, translated, the, wind, of, fuji, i, ve, brought, on, my, fan, a, gift, from, edo, this, separates, into, on, as, fu, ji, no, ka, ze, ya, 6, o, u, gi, ni, no, se, te, 7, e, do, mi, ya, ge, 5, this, haiku, example, was, written, by, kobayashi, issa, edo, no, ame, nan, goku, nonda, hototogisu, translated, of, edo, s, rain, how, many, mouthful, did, you, drink, cuckoo, this, separates, into, on, as, e, do, no, a, me, 5, na, n, go, ku, no, n, da, 7, ho, to, to, gi, su, 5, hokku, is, the, opening, stanza, of, an, orthodox, collaborative, linked, poem, or, renga, and, of, its, later, derivative, renku, or, haikai, no, renga, by, the, time, of, matsuo, bash, 1644, 1694, the, hokku, had, begun, to, appear, as, an, independent, poem, and, was, also, incorporated, in, haibun, a, combination, of, prose, and, hokku, and, haiga, a, combination, of, painting, with, hokku, in, the, late, 19th, century, masaoka, shiki, 1867, 1902, renamed, the, standalone, hokku, to, haiku, the, latter, term, is, now, generally, applied, retrospectively, to, all, hokku, appearing, independently, of, renku, or, renga, irrespective, of, when, they, were, written, and, the, use, of, the, term, hokku, to, describe, a, stand, alone, poem, is, considered, obsolete, in, the, 17th, century, two, masters, arose, who, elevated, haikai, and, gave, it, a, new, popularity, they, were, matsuo, bash, 1644, 1694, and, uejima, onitsura, 1661, 1738, hokku, is, the, first, verse, of, the, collaborative, haikai, or, renku, but, its, position, as, the, opening, verse, made, it, the, most, important, setting, the, tone, for, the, whole, composition, even, though, hokku, had, sometimes, appeared, individually, they, were, always, understood, in, the, context, of, renku, the, bash, school, promoted, standalone, hokku, by, including, many, in, their, anthologies, thus, giving, birth, to, what, is, now, called, haiku, bash, also, used, his, hokku, as, torque, points, within, his, short, prose, sketches, and, longer, travel, diaries, this, subgenre, of, haikai, is, known, as, haibun, his, best, known, work, oku, no, hosomichi, or, narrow, roads, to, the, interior, is, counted, as, one, of, the, classics, of, japanese, literature, and, has, been, translated, into, english, extensively, bash, was, deified, by, both, the, imperial, government, and, shinto, religious, headquarters, one, hundred, years, after, his, death, because, he, raised, the, haikai, genre, from, a, playful, game, of, wit, to, sublime, poetry, he, continues, to, be, revered, as, a, saint, of, poetry, in, japan, and, is, the, one, name, from, classical, japanese, literature, that, is, familiar, throughout, the, world, the, next, famous, style, of, haikai, to, arise, was, that, of, yosa, buson, 1716, 1784, and, others, such, as, kit, called, the, tenmei, style, after, the, tenmei, era, 1781, 1789, in, which, it, was, created, buson, is, recognized, as, one, of, the, greatest, masters, of, haiga, an, art, form, where, the, painting, is, combined, with, haiku, or, haikai, prose, his, affection, for, painting, can, be, seen, in, the, painterly, style, of, his, haiku, no, new, popular, style, followed, buson, however, a, very, individualistic, and, at, the, same, time, humanistic, approach, to, writing, haiku, was, demonstrated, by, the, poet, kobayashi, issa, 1763, 1827, whose, miserable, childhood, poverty, sad, life, and, devotion, to, the, pure, land, sect, of, buddhism, are, evident, in, his, poetry, issa, made, the, genre, immediately, accessible, to, wider, audiences, masaoka, shiki, 1867, 1902, was, a, reformer, and, modernizer, a, prolific, writer, even, though, chronically, ill, during, a, significant, part, of, his, life, shiki, disliked, the, stereotype, of, haikai, writers, of, the, 19th, century, who, were, known, by, the, deprecatory, term, tsukinami, meaning, monthly, after, the, monthly, or, twice, monthly, haikai, gatherings, of, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, in, regard, to, this, period, of, haikai, it, came, to, mean, trite, and, hackneyed, shiki, also, sometimes, criticized, bash, like, the, japanese, intellectual, world, in, general, at, that, time, shiki, was, strongly, influenced, by, western, culture, he, favored, the, painterly, style, of, buson, and, particularly, the, european, concept, of, plein, air, painting, which, he, adapted, to, create, a, style, of, haiku, as, a, kind, of, nature, sketch, in, words, an, approach, called, shasei, sketching, from, life, he, popularized, his, views, by, verse, columns, and, essays, in, newspapers, hokku, up, to, the, time, of, shiki, even, when, appearing, independently, were, written, in, the, context, of, renku, shiki, formally, separated, his, new, style, of, verse, from, the, context, of, collaborative, poetry, being, agnostic, he, also, separated, it, from, the, influence, of, buddhism, further, he, discarded, the, term, hokku, and, proposed, the, term, haiku, as, an, abbreviation, of, the, phrase, haikai, no, ku, meaning, a, verse, of, haikai, although, the, term, predates, shiki, by, some, two, centuries, when, it, was, used, to, mean, any, verse, of, haikai, since, then, haiku, has, been, the, term, usually, applied, in, both, japanese, and, english, to, all, independent, haiku, irrespective, of, their, date, of, composition, shiki, s, revisionism, dealt, a, severe, blow, to, renku, and, surviving, haikai, schools, the, term, hokku, is, now, used, chiefly, in, its, original, sense, of, the, opening, verse, of, a, renku, and, rarely, to, distinguish, haiku, written, before, shiki, s, time, the, earliest, westerner, known, to, have, written, haiku, was, the, dutchman, hendrik, doeff, 1764, 1837, who, was, the, dutch, commissioner, in, the, dejima, trading, post, in, nagasaki, during, the, first, years, of, the, 19th, century, one, of, his, haiku, is, the, following, inazuma, no, kaina, wo, karan, kusamakura, lend, me, your, arms, fast, as, thunderbolts, for, a, pillow, on, my, journey, although, there, were, further, attempts, outside, japan, to, imitate, the, hokku, in, the, early, 20th, century, there, was, little, understanding, of, its, principles, early, western, scholars, such, as, basil, hall, chamberlain, 1850, 1935, and, william, george, aston, were, mostly, dismissive, of, hokku, s, poetic, value, r, h, blyth, was, an, englishman, who, lived, in, japan, he, produced, a, series, of, works, on, zen, haiku, senry, and, on, other, forms, of, japanese, and, asian, literature, in, 1949, with, the, publication, in, japan,

as, a, major, interpreter, of, haiku, to, english, speakers, his, works, have, stimulated, the, writing, of, haiku, in, english, the, japanese, italian, translator, and, poet, harukichi, shimoi, introduced, haiku, to, italy, in, the, 1920s, through, his, work, with, the, magazine, sakura, as, well, as, his, close, personal, relationships, within, the, italian, literati, two, notable, influences, are, the, haikus, of, his, close, friend, gabriele, d, annunzio, and, to, a, lesser, extent, those, of, ezra, pound, to, whom, he, was, introduced, in, the, early, 1930s, an, early, example, of, his, work, appears, in, the, 1919, novella, la, guerra, italiana, vista, da, un, giapponese, which, features, a, haiku, by, the, japanese, feminist, poet, yosano, akiko, l, autunno, giovane, come, un, salone, della, reggia, perch, in, esso, gli, alberi, gli, uccelli, i, fiori, e, tutte, le, altre, cose, sono, placcati, di, oro, the, young, autumn, is, like, a, salon, in, the, palace, for, in, it, the, trees, the, birds, the, flowers, and, all, other, things, are, plated, with, gold, the, japanese, american, scholar, and, translator, kenneth, yasuda, published, the, japanese, haiku, its, essential, nature, history, and, possibilities, in, english, with, selected, examples, in, 1957, the, book, includes, both, translations, from, japanese, and, original, poems, of, his, own, in, english, which, had, previously, appeared, in, his, book, titled, a, pepper, pod, classic, japanese, poems, together, with, original, haiku, in, these, books, yasuda, presented, a, critical, theory, about, haiku, to, which, he, added, comments, on, haiku, poetry, by, early, 20th, century, poets, and, critics, his, translations, apply, a, 5, 7, 5, syllable, count, in, english, with, the, first, and, third, lines, end, rhymed, yasuda, considered, that, haiku, translated, into, english, should, utilize, all, of, the, poetic, resources, of, the, language, yasuda, s, theory, also, includes, the, concept, of, a, haiku, moment, based, in, personal, experience, and, provides, the, motive, for, writing, a, haiku, an, aesthetic, moment, of, a, timeless, feeling, of, enlightened, harmony, as, the, poet, s, nature, and, the, environment, are, unified, this, notion, of, the, haiku, moment, has, resonated, with, haiku, writers, in, english, even, though, the, notion, is, not, widely, promoted, in, japanese, haiku, in, 1958, an, introduction, to, haiku, an, anthology, of, poems, and, poets, from, bash, to, shiki, by, harold, g, henderson, was, published, by,

the, american, occupation, in, japan, and, for, the, imperial, household, respectively, and, their, shared, appreciation, of, haiku, helped, form, a, bond, between, the, two, henderson, translated, every, hokku, and, haiku, into, a, rhymed, tercet, aba, whereas, the, japanese, originals, never, used, rhyme, unlike, yasuda, however, he, recognized, that, 17, syllables, in, english, are, generally, longer, than, the, 17, on, of, a, traditional, japanese, haiku, because, the, normal, modes, of, english, poetry, depend, on, accentual, meter, rather, than, on, syllabics, henderson, chose, to, emphasize, the, order, of, events, and, images, in, the, originals, nevertheless, many, of, henderson, s, translations, were, in, the, five, seven, five, pattern, in, france, haiku, was,

other, members, of, the, proto, imagist, poets, club, such, as, ezra, pound, amy, lowell, made, a, trip, to, london, to, meet, pound, and, learn, about, haiku, she, returned, to, the, united, states,

advocates, of, english, language, hokku, was, the, japanese, poet, yone, noguchi, in, a, proposal, to, american, poets, published, in, the, reader, magazine, in, february, 1904, noguchi, gave, a, brief, outline, of, the, hokku, and, some, of, his, english, efforts, ending, with, the, exhortation, pray, you, try, japanese, hokku, my, american, poets, at, about, the, same, time, the, poet,

am, nobody, that, novelist, richard, wright, is, considered, the, first, noteworthy, american, minority, writer, to, produce, haiku, there, is, much, scholarly, debate, over, why, wright, became, interested, with, the, haiku, form, it, is, known, that, he, had, begun, to, study, haiku, while, battling, dysentery, while, wright, was, purportedly, an, avid, reader, of, ezra, pound, whose, imagist, poetry, was, based, on, the, haiku, form, iadonisi, suggests, that, wright, was, not, interested, in, american, style, haiku, instead, wright, opted, to, study, the, techniques, of, british,
