king, arthur, welsh, brenin, arthur, cornish, arthur, gernow, breton, roue, arzhur, french, roi, arthur, according, to, legends, was, a, king, of, britain, he, is, a, folk, hero, and, a, central, figure, in, the, medieval, literary, tradition, known, as, the, matter, of, britain, in, welsh, sources, arthur, is, portrayed, as, a, leader, of, the, post, roman, britons, in, battles, against, the, anglo, saxons, in, the, late, 5th, and, early, 6th, centuries, he, first, appears, in, two, early, medieval, historical, sources, the, annales, cambriae, and, the, historia, brittonum, but, these, date, to, 300, years, after, he, is, supposed, to, have, lived, and, most, historians, who, study, the, period, do, not, consider, him, a, historical, figure, his, name, also, occurs, in, early, welsh, poetic, sources, such, as, y, gododdin, the, character, developed, through, welsh, mythology, appearing, either, as, a, great, warrior, defending, britain, from, human, and, supernatural, enemies, or, as, a, magical, figure, of, folklore, sometimes, associated, with, the, welsh, otherworld, annwn, the, legendary, arthur, developed, as, a, figure, of, international, interest, largely, through, the, popularity, of, geoffrey, of, monmouth, s, fanciful, and, imaginative, 12th, century, historia, regum, britanniae, history, of, the, kings, of, britain, geoffrey, depicted, arthur, as, a, king, of, britain, who, defeated, the, saxons, and, established, a, vast, empire, many, elements, and, incidents, that, are, now, an, integral, part, of, the, arthurian, story, appear, in, geoffrey, s, historia, including, arthur, s, father, uther, pendragon, the, magician, merlin, arthur, s, wife, guinevere, the, sword, excalibur, arthur, s, conception, at, tintagel, his, final, battle, against, mordred, at, camlann, and, final, rest, in, avalon, the, 12th, century, french, writer, chr, tien, de, troyes, who, added, lancelot, and, the, holy, grail, to, the, story, began, the, genre, of, arthurian, romance, that, became, a, significant, strand, of, medieval, literature, in, these, french, stories, the, narrative, focus, often, shifts, from, king, arthur, himself, to, other, characters, such, as, various, knights, of, the, round, table, the, themes, events, and, characters, of, the, arthurian, legend, vary, widely, from, text, to, text, and, there, is, no, one, canonical, version, arthurian, literature, thrived, during, the, middle, ages, but, waned, in, the, centuries, that, followed, until, it, experienced, a, major, resurgence, in, the, 19th, century, in, the, 21st, century, the, legend, continues, to, have, prominence, not, only, in, literature, but, also, in, adaptations, for, theatre, film, television, comics, and, other, media, traditionally, it, was, generally, accepted, that, arthur, was, an, historic, person, originally, an, ancient, british, war, commander, and, at, least, from, the, early, twelfth, century, a, king, there, was, however, much, discussion, regarding, his, various, deeds, and, contemporary, scholars, and, clerics, generally, refuted, the, popular, medieval, belief, in, his, extreme, longevity, and, future, return, from, the, eighteenth, century, onwards, there, has, been, academic, debate, about, the, historicity, of, arthur, the, consensus, today, being, that, if, there, was, any, possible, historic, figure, person, behind, the, many, arthurian, legends, he, would, have, been, completely, different, from, the, portrayal, in, any, of, these, legends, one, school, of, thought, citing, entries, in, the, historia, brittonum, history, of, the, britons, and, annales, cambriae, welsh, annals, saw, arthur, as, a, genuine, historical, figure, a, romano, british, leader, who, fought, against, the, invading, anglo, saxons, some, time, in, the, late, 5th, to, early, 6th, century, the, historia, brittonum, a, 9th, century, latin, historical, compilation, attributed, in, some, late, manuscripts, to, a, welsh, cleric, called, nennius, contains, the, first, datable, mention, of, king, arthur, listing, twelve, battles, that, arthur, fought, these, culminate, in, the, battle, of, badon, where, he, is, said, to, have, single, handedly, killed, 960, men, recent, studies, question, the, reliability, of, the, historia, brittonum, archaeological, evidence, in, the, low, countries, and, what, was, to, become, england, shows, early, anglo, saxon, migration, to, great, britain, reversed, between, 500, and, 550, which, concurs, with, frankish, chronicles, john, davies, notes, this, as, consistent, with, the, british, victory, at, badon, hill, attributed, to, arthur, by, nennius, the, monks, of, glastonbury, are, also, said, to, have, discovered, the, grave, of, arthur, in, 1180, the, other, text, that, seems, to, support, the, case, for, arthur, s, historical, existence, is, the, 10th, century, annales, cambriae, which, also, link, arthur, with, the, battle, of, badon, the, annales, date, this, battle, to, 516, 518, and, also, mention, the, battle, of, camlann, in, which, arthur, and, medraut, mordred, were, both, killed, dated, to, 537, 539, these, details, have, often, been, used, to, bolster, confidence, in, the, historia, s, account, and, to, confirm, that, arthur, really, did, fight, at, badon, problems, have, been, identified, however, with, using, this, source, to, support, the, historia, brittonum, s, account, the, latest, research, shows, that, the, annales, cambriae, was, based, on, a, chronicle, begun, in, the, late, 8th, century, in, wales, additionally, the, complex, textual, history, of, the, annales, cambriae, precludes, any, certainty, that, the, arthurian, annals, were, added, to, it, even, that, early, they, were, more, likely, added, at, some, point, in, the, 10th, century, and, may, never, have, existed, in, any, earlier, set, of, annals, the, badon, entry, probably, derived, from, the, historia, brittonum, this, lack, of, convincing, early, evidence, is, the, reason, many, recent, historians, exclude, arthur, from, their, accounts, of, sub, roman, britain, in, the, view, of, historian, thomas, charles, edwards, at, this, stage, of, the, enquiry, one, can, only, say, that, there, may, well, have, been, an, historical, arthur, the, historian, can, as, yet, say, nothing, of, value, about, him, these, modern, admissions, of, ignorance, are, a, relatively, recent, trend, earlier, generations, of, historians, were, less, sceptical, the, historian, john, morris, made, the, putative, reign, of, arthur, the, organising, principle, of, his, history, of, sub, roman, britain, and, ireland, the, age, of, arthur, 1973, even, so, he, found, little, to, say, about, a, historical, arthur, partly, in, reaction, to, such, theories, another, school, of, thought, emerged, which, argued, that, arthur, had, no, historical, existence, at, all, morris, s, age, of, arthur, prompted, the, archaeologist, nowell, myres, to, observe, that, no, figure, on, the, borderline, of, history, and, mythology, has, wasted, more, of, the, historian, s, time, gildas, s, 6th, century, polemic, de, excidio, et, conquestu, britanniae, on, the, ruin, and, conquest, of, britain, written, within, living, memory, of, badon, mentions, the, battle, but, does, not, mention, arthur, arthur, is, not, mentioned, in, the, anglo, saxon, chronicle, or, named, in, any, surviving, manuscript, written, between, 400, and, 820, he, is, absent, from, bede, s, early, 8th, century, ecclesiastical, history, of, the, english, people, another, major, early, source, for, post, roman, history, that, mentions, badon, the, historian, david, dumville, wrote, i, think, we, can, dispose, of, him, quite, briefly, he, owes, his, place, in, our, history, books, to, a, no, smoke, without, fire, school, of, thought, the, fact, of, the, matter, is, that, there, is, no, historical, evidence, about, arthur, we, must, reject, him, from, our, histories, and, above, all, from, the, titles, of, our, books, some, scholars, argue, that, arthur, was, originally, a, fictional, hero, of, folklore, or, even, a, half, forgotten, celtic, deity, who, became, credited, with, real, deeds, in, the, distant, past, they, cite, parallels, with, figures, such, as, the, kentish, hengist, and, horsa, who, may, be, totemic, horse, gods, that, later, became, historicised, bede, ascribed, to, these, legendary, figures, a, historical, role, in, the, 5th, century, anglo, saxon, conquest, of, eastern, britain, it, is, not, even, certain, that, arthur, was, considered, a, king, in, the, early, texts, neither, the, historia, nor, the, annales, calls, him, rex, the, former, calls, him, instead, dux, bellorum, leader, of, wars, and, miles, soldier, details, of, arthur, s, story, are, mainly, composed, of, welsh, mythology, english, folklore, and, literary, invention, and, most, modern, historians, writing, about, the, period, do, not, think, that, he, was, a, historical, figure, because, historical, documents, for, the, post, roman, period, are, scarce, a, definitive, answer, to, the, question, of, arthur, s, historical, existence, is, unlikely, sites, and, places, have, been, identified, as, arthurian, since, the, 12th, century, but, archaeology, can, confidently, reveal, names, only, through, inscriptions, found, in, secure, contexts, the, so, called, arthur, stone, discovered, in, 1998, among, the, ruins, at, tintagel, castle, in, cornwall, in, securely, dated, 6th, century, contexts, created, a, brief, stir, but, proved, irrelevant, other, inscriptional, evidence, for, arthur, including, the, glastonbury, cross, is, tainted, with, the, suggestion, of, forgery, andrew, breeze, argues, that, arthur, was, a, historical, character, who, fought, other, britons, in, the, area, of, the, future, border, between, england, and, scotland, and, claims, to, have, identified, the, locations, of, his, battles, as, well, as, the, place, and, date, of, his, death, in, the, context, of, the, extreme, weather, events, of, 535, 536, but, his, conclusions, are, disputed, other, scholars, have, questioned, his, findings, which, they, consider, are, based, on, coincidental, resemblances, between, place, names, nicholas, higham, comments, that, it, is, difficult, to, justify, identifying, arthur, as, the, leader, in, northern, battles, listed, in, the, historia, brittonum, while, rejecting, the, implication, in, the, same, work, that, they, were, fought, against, anglo, saxons, and, that, there, is, no, textual, justification, for, separating, badon, from, the, other, battles, several, historical, figures, have, been, proposed, as, the, basis, for, arthur, ranging, from, lucius, artorius, castus, a, roman, officer, who, served, in, britain, in, the, 2nd, or, 3rd, century, to, sub, roman, british, rulers, such, as, riotamus, ambrosius, aurelianus, and, the, welsh, kings, owain, ddantgwyn, enniaun, girt, and, athrwys, ap, meurig, however, no, convincing, evidence, for, these, identifications, has, emerged, the, origin, of, the, welsh, name, arthur, remains, a, matter, of, debate, the, most, widely, accepted, etymology, derives, it, from, the, roman, nomen, gentile, family, name, artorius, artorius, itself, is, of, obscure, and, contested, etymology, linguist, stephan, zimmer, suggests, artorius, possibly, had, a, celtic, origin, being, a, latinization, of, a, hypothetical, name, artor, jos, in, turn, derived, from, an, older, patronym, arto, r, g, ios, meaning, son, of, the, bear, warrior, king, this, patronym, is, unattested, but, the, root, arto, r, g, bear, warrior, king, is, the, source, of, the, old, irish, personal, name, artr, some, scholars, have, suggested, it, is, relevant, to, this, debate, that, the, legendary, king, arthur, s, name, only, appears, as, arthur, or, arturus, in, early, latin, arthurian, texts, never, as, art, rius, though, classical, latin, art, rius, became, arturius, in, some, vulgar, latin, dialects, others, believe, the, origin, of, the, name, arthur, as, art, rius, would, regularly, become, art, h, ur, when, borrowed, into, welsh, another, commonly, proposed, derivation, of, arthur, from, welsh, arth, bear, g, wr, man, earlier, arto, uiros, in, brittonic, is, not, accepted, by, modern, scholars, for, phonological, and, orthographic, reasons, notably, a, brittonic, compound, name, arto, uiros, should, produce, old, welsh, artgur, where, u, represents, the, short, vowel, u, and, middle, modern, welsh, arthwr, rather, than, arthur, where, u, is, a, long, vowel, in, welsh, poetry, the, name, is, always, spelled, arthur, and, is, exclusively, rhymed, with, words, ending, in, ur, never, words, ending, in, wr, which, confirms, that, the, second, element, cannot, be, wr, man, an, alternative, theory, which, has, gained, only, limited, acceptance, among, professional, scholars, derives, the, name, arthur, from, arcturus, the, brightest, star, in, the, constellation, bo, tes, near, ursa, major, or, the, great, bear, classical, latin, arcturus, would, also, have, become, art, h, ur, when, borrowed, into, welsh, and, its, brightness, and, position, in, the, sky, led, people, to, regard, it, as, the, guardian, of, the, bear, which, is, the, meaning, of, the, name, in, ancient, greek, and, the, leader, of, the, other, stars, in, bo, tes, many, other, theories, exist, for, example, that, the, name, has, messapian, or, etruscan, origins, that, arthur, never, died, but, is, awaiting, his, return, in, some, remote, spot, often, sleeping, is, a, central, motif, connected, to, the, arthurian, legends, before, the, twelfth, century, there, are, as, in, the, englynion, y, beddau, reference, to, the, absence, of, a, grave, for, arthur, suggests, that, he, was, considered, not, dead, and, immortal, but, there, is, no, indication, that, he, was, expected, to, return, in, this, poem, from, the, early, twelfth, century, onwards, several, sources, report, about, a, popular, belief, in, the, return, of, king, arthur, although, most, often, critically, and, mockingly, presented, his, future, return, is, first, mentioned, by, william, of, malmesbury, in, 1125, but, arthur, s, grave, is, nowhere, seen, whence, antiquity, of, fables, still, claims, that, he, will, return, in, the, miracles, of, st, mary, of, laon, de, miraculis, sanctae, mariae, laudunensis, written, by, a, french, cleric, and, chronicler, named, h, riman, of, tournai, about, 1145, but, referring, to, events, occurring, in, 1113, mentions, the, breton, and, cornish, belief, that, arthur, still, lived, in, 1191, the, alleged, tomb, of, arthur, was, identified, in, an, obviously, orchestrated, discovery, at, glastonbury, abbey, whereas, numerous, scholars, have, argued, that, this, could, have, been, due, to, the, abbey, wanting, to, stand, out, with, an, illustrious, tomb, or, to, a, desire, of, the, plantagenet, regime, to, put, an, end, to, a, legendary, rival, figure, who, inspired, tenacious, celtic, opposition, to, their, rule, it, may, also, have, been, motivated, by, how, the, arthurian, expectations, were, highly, problematic, to, contemporary, christianity, the, longing, of, the, return, of, a, mighty, immortal, figure, returning, before, the, end, of, time, to, re, establish, his, perfect, rule, not, only, ran, against, basic, catholic, tenets, but, could, even, threaten, the, quintessential, focus, on, the, longing, for, the, return, of, jesus, this, was, further, aggravated, by, how, the, stories, about, arthur, often, at, times, invoked, more, emotions, than, biblical, tales, decades, of, elite, critique, of, the, popular, conviction, among, otherwise, pious, catholic, celts, in, britain, and, brittany, had, done, nothing, in, way, of, suppressing, these, beliefs, whereas, the, orchestration, of, arthur, s, physical, remains, effectively, eliminated, the, possibility, of, his, return, without, overtly, criticizing, anyone, s, beliefs, after, the, 1191, discovery, of, his, alleged, tomb, arthur, became, more, of, a, figure, of, folk, legends, found, sleeping, in, various, remove, caves, all, over, britain, and, some, other, places, and, at, times, roaming, the, night, as, a, spectre, like, in, the, wild, hunt, the, familiar, literary, persona, of, arthur, began, with, geoffrey, of, monmouth, s, pseudo, historical, historia, regum, britanniae, history, of, the, kings, of, britain, written, in, the, 1130s, the, textual, sources, for, arthur, are, usually, divided, into, those, written, before, geoffrey, s, historia, known, as, pre, galfridian, texts, from, the, latin, form, of, geoffrey, galfridus, and, those, written, afterwards, which, could, not, avoid, his, influence, galfridian, or, post, galfridian, texts, the, earliest, literary, references, to, arthur, come, from, welsh, and, breton, sources, there, have, been, few, attempts, to, define, the, nature, and, character, of, arthur, in, the, pre, galfridian, tradition, as, a, whole, rather, than, in, a, single, text, or, text, story, type, a, 2007, academic, survey, led, by, caitlin, green, has, identified, three, key, strands, to, the, portrayal, of, arthur, in, this, earliest, material, the, first, is, that, he, was, a, peerless, warrior, who, functioned, as, the, monster, hunting, protector, of, britain, from, all, internal, and, external, threats, some, of, these, are, human, threats, such, as, the, saxons, he, fights, in, the, historia, brittonum, but, the, majority, are, supernatural, including, giant, cat, monsters, destructive, divine, boars, dragons, dogheads, giants, and, witches, the, second, is, that, the, pre, galfridian, arthur, was, a, figure, of, folklore, particularly, topographic, or, onomastic, folklore, and, localised, magical, wonder, tales, the, leader, of, a, band, of, superhuman, heroes, who, live, in, the, wilds, of, the, landscape, the, third, and, final, strand, is, that, the, early, welsh, arthur, had, a, close, connection, with, the, welsh, otherworld, annwn, on, the, one, hand, he, launches, assaults, on, otherworldly, fortresses, in, search, of, treasure, and, frees, their, prisoners, on, the, other, his, warband, in, the, earliest, sources, includes, former, pagan, gods, and, his, wife, and, his, possessions, are, clearly, otherworldly, in, origin, one, of, the, most, famous, welsh, poetic, references, to, arthur, comes, in, the, collection, of, heroic, death, songs, known, as, y, gododdin, the, gododdin, attributed, to, the, 6th, century, poet, aneirin, one, stanza, praises, the, bravery, of, a, warrior, who, slew, 300, enemies, but, says, that, despite, this, he, was, no, arthur, that, is, his, feats, cannot, compare, to, the, valour, of, arthur, y, gododdin, is, known, only, from, a, 13th, century, manuscript, so, it, is, impossible, to, determine, whether, this, passage, is, original, or, a, later, interpolation, but, john, koch, s, view, that, the, passage, dates, from, a, 7th, century, or, earlier, version, is, regarded, as, unproven, 9th, or, 10th, century, dates, are, often, proposed, for, it, several, poems, attributed, to, taliesin, a, poet, said, to, have, lived, in, the, 6th, century, also, refer, to, arthur, although, these, all, probably, date, from, between, the, 8th, and, 12th, centuries, they, include, kadeir, teyrnon, the, chair, of, the, prince, which, refers, to, arthur, the, blessed, preiddeu, annwn, the, spoils, of, annwn, which, recounts, an, expedition, of, arthur, to, the, otherworld, and, marwnat, vthyr, pen, the, elegy, of, uther, pen, which, refers, to, arthur, s, valour, and, is, suggestive, of, a, father, son, relationship, for, arthur, and, uther, that, pre, dates, geoffrey, of, monmouth, other, early, welsh, arthurian, texts, include, a, poem, found, in, the, black, book, of, carmarthen, pa, gur, yv, y, porthaur, what, man, is, the, gatekeeper, this, takes, the, form, of, a, dialogue, between, arthur, and, the, gatekeeper, of, a, fortress, he, wishes, to, enter, in, which, arthur, recounts, the, names, and, deeds, of, himself, and, his, men, notably, cei, kay, and, bedwyr, bedivere, the, welsh, prose, tale, culhwch, and, olwen, c, 1100, included, in, the, modern, mabinogion, collection, has, a, much, longer, list, of, more, than, 200, of, arthur, s, men, though, cei, and, bedwyr, again, take, a, central, place, the, story, as, a, whole, tells, of, arthur, helping, his, kinsman, culhwch, win, the, hand, of, olwen, daughter, of, ysbaddaden, chief, giant, by, completing, a, series, of, apparently, impossible, tasks, including, the, hunt, for, the, great, semi, divine, boar, twrch, trwyth, the, 9th, century, historia, brittonum, also, refers, to, this, tale, with, the, boar, there, named, troy, n, t, finally, arthur, is, mentioned, numerous, times, in, the, welsh, triads, a, collection, of, short, summaries, of, welsh, tradition, and, legend, which, are, classified, into, groups, of, three, linked, characters, or, episodes, to, assist, recall, the, later, manuscripts, of, the, triads, are, partly, derivative, from, geoffrey, of, monmouth, and, later, continental, traditions, but, the, earliest, ones, show, no, such, influence, and, are, usually, agreed, to, refer, to, pre, existing, welsh, traditions, even, in, these, however, arthur, s, court, has, started, to, embody, legendary, britain, as, a, whole, with, arthur, s, court, sometimes, substituted, for, the, island, of, britain, in, the, formula, three, xxx, of, the, island, of, britain, while, it, is, not, clear, from, the, historia, brittonum, and, the, annales, cambriae, that, arthur, was, even, considered, a, king, by, the, time, culhwch, and, olwen, and, the, triads, were, written, he, had, become, penteyrnedd, yr, ynys, hon, chief, of, the, lords, of, this, island, the, overlord, of, wales, cornwall, and, the, north, in, addition, to, these, pre, galfridian, welsh, poems, and, tales, arthur, appears, in, some, other, early, latin, texts, besides, the, historia, brittonum, and, the, annales, cambriae, in, particular, arthur, features, in, a, number, of, well, known, vitae, lives, of, post, roman, saints, none, of, which, are, now, generally, considered, to, be, reliable, historical, sources, the, earliest, probably, dates, from, the, 11th, century, according, to, the, life, of, saint, gildas, written, in, the, early, 12th, century, by, caradoc, of, llancarfan, arthur, is, said, to, have, killed, gildas, s, brother, hueil, and, to, have, rescued, his, wife, gwenhwyfar, from, glastonbury, in, the, life, of, saint, cadoc, written, around, 1100, or, a, little, before, by, lifris, of, llancarfan, the, saint, gives, protection, to, a, man, who, killed, three, of, arthur, s, soldiers, and, arthur, demands, a, herd, of, cattle, as, wergeld, for, his, men, cadoc, delivers, them, as, demanded, but, when, arthur, takes, possession, of, the, animals, they, turn, into, bundles, of, ferns, similar, incidents, are, described, in, the, medieval, biographies, of, carannog, padarn, and, eufflam, probably, written, around, the, 12th, century, a, less, obviously, legendary, account, of, arthur, appears, in, the, legenda, sancti, goeznovii, which, is, often, claimed, to, date, from, the, early, 11th, century, although, the, earliest, manuscript, of, this, text, dates, from, the, 15th, century, and, the, text, is, now, dated, to, the, late, 12th, to, early, 13th, century, also, important, are, the, references, to, arthur, in, william, of, malmesbury, s, de, gestis, regum, anglorum, and, herman, s, de, miraculis, sanctae, mariae, laudunensis, which, together, provide, the, first, certain, evidence, for, a, belief, that, arthur, was, not, actually, dead, and, would, at, some, point, return, a, theme, that, is, often, revisited, in, post, galfridian, folklore, geoffrey, of, monmouth, s, historia, regum, britanniae, completed, c, 1138, contains, the, first, narrative, account, of, arthur, s, life, this, work, is, an, imaginative, and, fanciful, account, of, british, kings, from, the, legendary, trojan, exile, brutus, to, the, 7th, century, welsh, king, cadwallader, geoffrey, places, arthur, in, the, same, post, roman, period, as, do, historia, brittonum, and, annales, cambriae, according, to, geoffrey, s, tale, arthur, was, a, descendant, of, constantine, the, great, he, incorporates, arthur, s, father, uther, pendragon, his, magician, advisor, merlin, and, the, story, of, arthur, s, conception, in, which, uther, disguised, as, his, enemy, gorlois, by, merlin, s, magic, sleeps, with, gorlois, s, wife, igerna, igraine, at, tintagel, and, she, conceives, arthur, on, uther, s, death, the, fifteen, year, old, arthur, succeeds, him, as, king, of, britain, and, fights, a, series, of, battles, similar, to, those, in, the, historia, brittonum, culminating, in, the, battle, of, bath, he, then, defeats, the, picts, and, scots, before, creating, an, arthurian, empire, through, his, conquests, of, ireland, iceland, and, the, orkney, islands, after, twelve, years, of, peace, arthur, sets, out, to, expand, his, empire, once, more, taking, control, of, norway, denmark, and, gaul, gaul, is, still, held, by, the, roman, empire, when, it, is, conquered, and, arthur, s, victory, leads, to, a, further, confrontation, with, rome, arthur, and, his, warriors, including, kaius, kay, beduerus, bedivere, and, gualguanus, gawain, defeat, the, roman, emperor, lucius, tiberius, in, gaul, but, as, he, prepares, to, march, on, rome, arthur, hears, that, his, nephew, modredus, mordred, whom, he, had, left, in, charge, of, britain, has, married, his, wife, guenhuuara, guinevere, and, seized, the, throne, arthur, returns, to, britain, and, defeats, and, kills, modredus, on, the, river, camblam, in, cornwall, but, he, is, mortally, wounded, he, hands, the, crown, to, his, kinsman, constantine, and, is, taken, to, the, isle, of, avalon, to, be, healed, of, his, wounds, never, to, be, seen, again, how, much, of, this, narrative, was, geoffrey, s, own, invention, is, open, to, debate, he, seems, to, have, made, use, of, the, list, of, arthur, s, twelve, battles, against, the, saxons, found, in, the, 9th, century, historia, brittonum, along, with, the, battle, of, camlann, from, the, annales, cambriae, and, the, idea, that, arthur, was, still, alive, arthur, s, status, as, the, king, of, all, britain, seems, to, be, borrowed, from, pre, galfridian, tradition, being, found, in, culhwch, and, olwen, the, welsh, triads, and, the, saints, lives, finally, geoffrey, borrowed, many, of, the, names, for, arthur, s, possessions, close, family, and, companions, from, the, pre, galfridian, welsh, tradition, including, kaius, cei, beduerus, bedwyr, guenhuuara, gwenhwyfar, uther, uthyr, and, perhaps, also, caliburnus, caledfwlch, the, latter, becoming, excalibur, in, subsequent, arthurian, tales, however, while, names, key, events, and, titles, may, have, been, borrowed, brynley, roberts, has, argued, that, the, arthurian, section, is, geoffrey, s, literary, creation, and, it, owes, nothing, to, prior, narrative, geoffrey, makes, the, welsh, medraut, into, the, villainous, modredus, but, there, is, no, trace, of, such, a, negative, character, for, this, figure, in, welsh, sources, until, the, 16th, century, there, have, been, relatively, few, modern, attempts, to, challenge, the, notion, that, the, historia, regum, britanniae, is, primarily, geoffrey, s, own, work, with, scholarly, opinion, often, echoing, william, of, newburgh, s, late, 12th, century, comment, that, geoffrey, made, up, his, narrative, perhaps, through, an, inordinate, love, of, lying, geoffrey, ashe, is, one, dissenter, from, this, view, believing, that, geoffrey, s, narrative, is, partially, derived, from, a, lost, source, telling, of, the, deeds, of, a, 5th, century, british, king, named, riotamus, this, figure, being, the, original, arthur, although, historians, and, celticists, have, been, reluctant, to, follow, ashe, in, his, conclusions, whatever, his, sources, may, have, been, the, immense, popularity, of, geoffrey, s, historia, regum, britanniae, cannot, be, denied, well, over, 200, manuscript, copies, of, geoffrey, s, latin, work, are, known, to, have, survived, as, well, as, translations, into, other, languages, for, example, 60, manuscripts, are, extant, containing, the, brut, y, brenhinedd, welsh, language, versions, of, the, historia, the, earliest, of, which, were, created, in, the, 13th, century, the, old, notion, that, some, of, these, welsh, versions, actually, underlie, geoffrey, s, historia, advanced, by, antiquarians, such, as, the, 18th, century, lewis, morris, has, long, since, been, discounted, in, academic, circles, as, a, result, of, this, popularity, geoffrey, s, historia, regum, britanniae, was, enormously, influential, on, the, later, medieval, development, of, the, arthurian, legend, while, it, was, not, the, only, creative, force, behind, arthurian, romance, many, of, its, elements, were, borrowed, and, developed, e, g, merlin, and, the, final, fate, of, arthur, and, it, provided, the, historical, framework, into, which, the, romancers, tales, of, magical, and, wonderful, adventures, were, inserted, during, the, ongoing, conquest, of, wales, by, edward, i, he, attempted, to, make, king, arthur, a, fundamentally, english, character, and, hero, the, completion, of, the, conquest, was, one, of, the, factors, that, shifted, storytellers, away, from, the, welsh, roots, of, the, original, tales, the, popularity, of, geoffrey, s, historia, and, its, other, derivative, works, such, as, wace, s, roman, de, brut, gave, rise, to, a, significant, numbers, of, new, arthurian, works, in, continental, europe, during, the, 12th, and, 13th, centuries, particularly, in, france, it, was, not, however, the, only, arthurian, influence, on, the, developing, matter, of, britain, there, is, clear, evidence, that, arthur, and, arthurian, tales, were, familiar, on, the, continent, before, geoffrey, s, work, became, widely, known, see, for, example, the, modena, archivolt, and, celtic, names, and, stories, not, found, in, geoffrey, s, historia, appear, in, the, arthurian, romances, from, the, perspective, of, arthur, perhaps, the, most, significant, effect, of, this, great, outpouring, of, new, arthurian, story, was, on, the, role, of, the, king, himself, much, of, this, 12th, century, and, later, arthurian, literature, centres, less, on, arthur, himself, than, on, characters, such, as, lancelot, and, guinevere, percival, galahad, gawain, ywain, and, tristan, and, iseult, whereas, arthur, is, very, much, at, the, centre, of, the, pre, galfridian, material, and, geoffrey, s, historia, itself, in, the, romances, he, is, rapidly, sidelined, his, character, also, alters, significantly, in, both, the, earliest, materials, and, geoffrey, he, is, a, great, and, ferocious, warrior, who, laughs, as, he, personally, slaughters, witches, and, giants, and, takes, a, leading, role, in, all, military, campaigns, whereas, in, the, continental, romances, he, becomes, the, roi, fain, ant, the, do, nothing, king, whose, inactivity, and, acquiescence, constituted, a, central, flaw, in, his, otherwise, ideal, society, arthur, s, role, in, these, works, is, frequently, that, of, a, wise, dignified, even, tempered, somewhat, bland, and, occasionally, feeble, monarch, so, he, simply, turns, pale, and, silent, when, he, learns, of, lancelot, s, affair, with, guinevere, in, the, mort, artu, whilst, in, yvain, the, knight, of, the, lion, he, is, unable, to, stay, awake, after, a, feast, and, has, to, retire, for, a, nap, nonetheless, as, norris, j, lacy, has, observed, whatever, his, faults, and, frailties, may, be, in, these, arthurian, romances, his, prestige, is, never, or, almost, never, compromised, by, his, personal, weaknesses, his, authority, and, glory, remain, intact, arthur, and, his, retinue, appear, in, some, of, the, lais, of, marie, de, france, but, it, was, the, work, of, another, french, poet, chr, tien, de, troyes, that, had, the, greatest, influence, with, regard, to, the, development, of, arthur, s, character, and, legend, chr, tien, wrote, five, arthurian, romances, between, c, 1170, and, 1190, erec, and, enide, and, clig, s, are, tales, of, courtly, love, with, arthur, s, court, as, their, backdrop, demonstrating, the, shift, away, from, the, heroic, world, of, the, welsh, and, galfridian, arthur, while, yvain, the, knight, of, the, lion, features, yvain, and, gawain, in, a, supernatural, adventure, with, arthur, very, much, on, the, sidelines, and, weakened, however, the, most, significant, for, the, development, of, the, arthurian, legend, are, lancelot, the, knight, of, the, cart, which, introduces, lancelot, and, his, adulterous, relationship, with, arthur, s, queen, guinevere, extending, and, popularising, the, recurring, theme, of, arthur, as, a, cuckold, and, perceval, the, story, of, the, grail, which, introduces, the, holy, grail, and, the, fisher, king, and, which, again, sees, arthur, having, a, much, reduced, role, chr, tien, was, thus, instrumental, both, in, the, elaboration, of, the, arthurian, legend, and, in, the, establishment, of, the, ideal, form, for, the, diffusion, of, that, legend, and, much, of, what, came, after, him, in, terms, of, the, portrayal, of, arthur, and, his, world, built, upon, the, foundations, he, had, laid, perceval, although, unfinished, was, particularly, popular, four, separate, continuations, of, the, poem, appeared, over, the, next, half, century, with, the, notion, of, the, grail, and, its, quest, being, developed, by, other, writers, such, as, robert, de, boron, a, fact, that, helped, accelerate, the, decline, of, arthur, in, continental, romance, similarly, lancelot, and, his, cuckolding, of, arthur, with, guinevere, became, one, of, the, classic, motifs, of, the, arthurian, legend, although, the, lancelot, of, the, prose, lancelot, c, 1225, and, later, texts, was, a, combination, of, chr, tien, s, character, and, that, of, ulrich, von, zatzikhoven, s, lanzelet, chr, tien, s, work, even, appears, to, feed, back, into, welsh, arthurian, literature, with, the, result, that, the, romance, arthur, began, to, replace, the, heroic, active, arthur, in, welsh, literary, tradition, particularly, significant, in, this, development, were, the, three, welsh, arthurian, romances, which, are, closely, similar, to, those, of, chr, tien, albeit, with, some, significant, differences, owain, or, the, lady, of, the, fountain, is, related, to, chr, tien, s, yvain, geraint, and, enid, to, erec, and, enide, and, peredur, son, of, efrawg, to, perceval, up, to, c, 1210, continental, arthurian, romance, was, expressed, primarily, through, poetry, after, this, date, the, tales, began, to, be, told, in, prose, the, most, significant, of, these, 13th, century, prose, romances, was, the, vulgate, cycle, also, known, as, the, lancelot, grail, cycle, a, series, of, five, middle, french, prose, works, written, in, the, first, half, of, that, century, these, works, were, the, estoire, del, saint, grail, the, estoire, de, merlin, the, lancelot, propre, or, prose, lancelot, which, made, up, half, the, entire, vulgate, cycle, on, its, own, the, queste, del, saint, graal, and, the, mort, artu, which, combine, to, form, the, first, coherent, version, of, the, entire, arthurian, legend, the, cycle, continued, the, trend, towards, reducing, the, role, played, by, arthur, in, his, own, legend, partly, through, the, introduction, of, the, character, of, galahad, and, an, expansion, of, the, role, of, merlin, it, also, made, mordred, the, result, of, an, incestuous, relationship, between, arthur, and, his, sister, morgause, and, established, the, role, of, camelot, first, mentioned, in, passing, in, chr, tien, s, lancelot, as, arthur, s, primary, court, this, series, of, texts, was, quickly, followed, by, the, post, vulgate, cycle, c, 1230, 40, of, which, the, suite, du, merlin, is, a, part, which, greatly, reduced, the, importance, of, lancelot, s, affair, with, guinevere, but, continued, to, sideline, arthur, and, to, focus, more, on, the, grail, quest, as, such, arthur, became, even, more, of, a, relatively, minor, character, in, these, french, prose, romances, in, the, vulgate, itself, he, only, figures, significantly, in, the, estoire, de, merlin, and, the, mort, artu, during, this, period, arthur, was, made, one, of, the, nine, worthies, a, group, of, three, pagan, three, jewish, and, three, christian, exemplars, of, chivalry, the, worthies, were, first, listed, in, jacques, de, longuyon, s, voeux, du, paon, in, 1312, and, subsequently, became, a, common, subject, in, literature, and, art, the, development, of, the, medieval, arthurian, cycle, and, the, character, of, the, arthur, of, romance, culminated, in, le, morte, d, arthur, thomas, malory, s, retelling, of, the, entire, legend, in, a, single, work, in, english, in, the, late, 15th, century, malory, based, his, book, originally, titled, the, whole, book, of, king, arthur, and, of, his, noble, knights, of, the, round, table, on, the, various, previous, romance, versions, in, particular, the, vulgate, cycle, and, appears, to, have, aimed, at, creating, a, comprehensive, and, authoritative, collection, of, arthurian, stories, perhaps, as, a, result, of, this, and, the, fact, that, le, morte, d, arthur, was, one, of, the, earliest, printed, books, in, england, published, by, william, caxton, in, 1485, most, later, arthurian, works, are, derivative, of, malory, s, the, end, of, the, middle, ages, brought, with, it, a, waning, of, interest, in, king, arthur, although, malory, s, english, version, of, the, great, french, romances, was, popular, there, were, increasing, attacks, upon, the, truthfulness, of, the, historical, framework, of, the, arthurian, romances, established, since, geoffrey, of, monmouth, s, time, and, thus, the, legitimacy, of, the, whole, matter, of, britain, so, for, example, the, 16th, century, humanist, scholar, polydore, vergil, famously, rejected, the, claim, that, arthur, was, the, ruler, of, a, post, roman, empire, found, throughout, the, post, galfridian, medieval, chronicle, tradition, to, the, horror, of, welsh, and, english, antiquarians, social, changes, associated, with, the, end, of, the, medieval, period, and, the, renaissance, also, conspired, to, rob, the, character, of, arthur, and, his, associated, legend, of, some, of, their, power, to, enthrall, audiences, with, the, result, that, 1634, saw, the, last, printing, of, malory, s, le, morte, d, arthur, for, nearly, 200, years, king, arthur, and, the, arthurian, legend, were, not, entirely, abandoned, but, until, the, early, 19th, century, the, material, was, taken, less, seriously, and, was, often, used, simply, as, a, vehicle, for, allegories, of, 17th, and, 18th, century, politics, thus, richard, blackmore, s, epics, prince, arthur, 1695, and, king, arthur, 1697, feature, arthur, as, an, allegory, for, the, struggles, of, william, iii, against, james, ii, similarly, the, most, popular, arthurian, tale, throughout, this, period, seems, to, have, been, that, of, tom, thumb, which, was, told, first, through, chapbooks, and, later, through, the, political, plays, of, henry, fielding, although, the, action, is, clearly, set, in, arthurian, britain, the, treatment, is, humorous, and, arthur, appears, as, a, primarily, comedic, version, of, his, romance, character, john, dryden, s, masque, king, arthur, is, still, performed, largely, thanks, to, henry, purcell, s, music, though, seldom, unabridged, in, the, early, 19th, century, medievalism, romanticism, and, the, gothic, revival, reawakened, interest, in, arthur, and, the, medieval, romances, a, new, code, of, ethics, for, 19th, century, gentlemen, was, shaped, around, the, chivalric, ideals, embodied, in, the, arthur, of, romance, this, renewed, interest, first, made, itself, felt, in, 1816, when, malory, s, le, morte, d, arthur, was, reprinted, for, the, first, time, since, 1634, initially, the, medieval, arthurian, legends, were, of, particular, interest, to, poets, inspiring, for, example, william, wordsworth, to, write, the, egyptian, maid, 1835, an, allegory, of, the, holy, grail, pre, eminent, among, these, was, alfred, tennyson, whose, first, arthurian, poem, the, lady, of, shalott, was, published, in, 1832, arthur, himself, played, a, minor, role, in, some, of, these, works, following, in, the, medieval, romance, tradition, tennyson, s, arthurian, work, reached, its, peak, of, popularity, with, idylls, of, the, king, however, which, reworked, the, entire, narrative, of, arthur, s, life, for, the, victorian, era, it, was, first, published, in, 1859, and, sold, 10, 000, copies, within, the, first, week, in, the, idylls, arthur, became, a, symbol, of, ideal, manhood, who, ultimately, failed, through, human, weakness, to, establish, a, perfect, kingdom, on, earth, tennyson, s, works, prompted, a, large, number, of, imitators, generated, considerable, public, interest, in, the, legends, of, arthur, and, the, character, himself, and, brought, malory, s, tales, to, a, wider, audience, indeed, the, first, modernisation, of, malory, s, great, compilation, of, arthur, s, tales, was, published, in, 1862, shortly, after, idylls, appeared, and, there, were, six, further, editions, and, five, competitors, before, the, century, ended, this, interest, in, the, arthur, of, romance, and, his, associated, stories, continued, through, the, 19th, century, and, into, the, 20th, and, influenced, poets, such, as, william, morris, and, pre, raphaelite, artists, including, edward, burne, jones, even, the, humorous, tale, of, tom, thumb, which, had, been, the, primary, manifestation, of, arthur, s, legend, in, the, 18th, century, was, rewritten, after, the, publication, of, idylls, while, tom, maintained, his, small, stature, and, remained, a, figure, of, comic, relief, his, story, now, included, more, elements, from, the, medieval, arthurian, romances, and, arthur, is, treated, more, seriously, and, historically, in, these, new, versions, the, revived, arthurian, romance, also, proved, influential, in, the, united, states, with, such, books, as, sidney, lanier, s, the, boy, s, king, arthur, 1880, reaching, wide, audiences, and, providing, inspiration, for, mark, twain, s, satire, a, connecticut, yankee, in, king, arthur, s, court, 1889, although, the, arthur, of, romance, was, sometimes, central, to, these, new, arthurian, works, as, he, was, in, burne, jones, s, the, sleep, of, arthur, in, avalon, 1881, 1898, on, other, occasions, he, reverted, to, his, medieval, status, and, is, either, marginalised, or, even, missing, entirely, with, wagner, s, arthurian, opera, parsifal, providing, a, notable, instance, of, the, latter, furthermore, the, revival, of, interest, in, arthur, and, the, arthurian, tales, did, not, continue, unabated, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, it, was, confined, mainly, to, pre, raphaelite, imitators, and, it, could, not, avoid, being, affected, by, world, war, i, which, damaged, the, reputation, of, chivalry, and, thus, interest, in, its, medieval, manifestations, and, arthur, as, chivalric, role, model, the, romance, tradition, did, however, remain, sufficiently, powerful, to, persuade, thomas, hardy, laurence, binyon, and, john, masefield, to, compose, arthurian, plays, and, t, s, eliot, alludes, to, the, arthur, myth, but, not, arthur, in, his, poem, the, waste, land, which, mentions, the, fisher, king, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 20th, century, the, influence, of, the, romance, tradition, of, arthur, continued, through, novels, such, as, t, h, white, s, the, once, and, future, king, 1958, mary, stewart, s, the, crystal, cave, 1970, and, its, four, sequels, thomas, berger, s, tragicomic, arthur, rex, and, marion, zimmer, bradley, s, the, mists, of, avalon, 1982, in, addition, to, comic, strips, such, as, prince, valiant, from, 1937, onward, tennyson, had, reworked, the, romance, tales, of, arthur, to, suit, and, comment, upon, the, issues, of, his, day, and, the, same, is, often, the, case, with, modern, treatments, too, mary, stewart, s, first, three, arthurian, novels, present, the, wizard, merlin, as, the, central, character, rather, than, arthur, and, the, crystal, cave, is, narrated, by, merlin, in, the, first, person, whereas, bradley, s, tale, takes, a, feminist, approach, to, arthur, and, his, legend, in, contrast, to, the, narratives, of, arthur, found, in, medieval, materials, american, authors, often, rework, the, story, of, arthur, to, be, more, consistent, with, values, such, as, equality, and, democracy, in, john, cowper, powys, s, porius, a, romance, of, the, dark, ages, 1951, set, in, wales, in, 499, just, prior, to, the, saxon, invasion, arthur, the, emperor, of, britain, is, only, a, minor, character, whereas, myrddin, merlin, and, nineue, tennyson, s, vivien, are, major, figures, myrddin, s, disappearance, at, the, end, of, the, novel, is, in, the, tradition, of, magical, hibernation, when, the, king, or, mage, leaves, his, people, for, some, island, or, cave, to, return, either, at, a, more, propitious, or, more, dangerous, time, see, king, arthur, s, messianic, return, powys, s, earlier, novel, a, glastonbury, romance, 1932, is, concerned, with, both, the, holy, grail, and, the, legend, that, arthur, is, buried, at, glastonbury, the, romance, arthur, has, become, popular, in, film, and, theatre, as, well, t, h, white, s, novel, was, adapted, into, the, lerner, and, loewe, stage, musical, camelot, 1960, and, walt, disney, s, animated, film, the, sword, in, the, stone, 1963, camelot, with, its, focus, on, the, love, of, lancelot, and, guinevere, and, the, cuckolding, of, arthur, was, itself, made, into, a, film, of, the, same, name, in, 1967, the, romance, tradition, of, arthur, is, particularly, evident, and, in, critically, respected, films, like, robert, bresson, s, lancelot, du, lac, 1974, ric, rohmer, s, perceval, le, gallois, 1978, and, john, boorman, s, excalibur, 1981, it, is, also, the, main, source, of, the, material, used, in, the, arthurian, spoof, monty, python, and, the, holy, grail, 1975, retellings, and, reimaginings, of, the, romance, tradition, are, not, the, only, important, aspect, of, the, modern, legend, of, king, arthur, attempts, to, portray, arthur, as, a, genuine, historical, figure, of, c, 500, stripping, away, the, romance, have, also, emerged, as, taylor, and, brewer, have, noted, this, return, to, the, medieval, chronicle, tradition, of, geoffrey, of, monmouth, and, the, historia, brittonum, is, a, recent, trend, which, became, dominant, in, arthurian, literature, in, the, years, following, the, outbreak, of, the, second, world, war, when, arthur, s, legendary, resistance, to, germanic, enemies, struck, a, chord, in, britain, clemence, dane, s, series, of, radio, plays, the, saviours, 1942, used, a, historical, arthur, to, embody, the, spirit, of, heroic, resistance, against, desperate, odds, and, robert, sherriff, s, play, the, long, sunset, 1955, saw, arthur, rallying, romano, british, resistance, against, the, germanic, invaders, this, trend, towards, placing, arthur, in, a, historical, setting, is, also, apparent, in, historical, and, fantasy, novels, published, during, this, period, arthur, has, also, been, used, as, a, model, for, modern, day, behaviour, in, the, 1930s, the, order, of, the, fellowship, of, the, knights, of, the, round, table, was, formed, in, britain, to, promote, christian, ideals, and, arthurian, notions, of, medieval, chivalry, in, the, united, states, hundreds, of, thousands, of, boys, and, girls, joined, arthurian, youth, groups, such, as, the, knights, of, king, arthur, in, which, arthur, and, his, legends, were, promoted, as, wholesome, exemplars, however, arthur, s, diffusion, within, modern, culture, goes, beyond, such, obviously, arthurian, endeavours, with, arthurian, names, being, regularly, attached, to, objects, buildings, and, places, as, norris, j, lacy, has, observed, the, popular, notion, of, arthur, appears, to, be, limited, not, surprisingly, to, a, few, motifs, and, names, but, there, can, be, no, doubt, of, the, extent, to, which, a, legend, born, many, centuries, ago, is, profoundly, embedded, in, modern, culture, at, every, level
