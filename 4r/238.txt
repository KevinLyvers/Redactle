the, i, ching, or, yijing, chinese, mandarin, usually, translated, book, of, changes, or, classic, of, changes, is, an, ancient, chinese, divination, text, that, is, among, the, oldest, of, the, chinese, classics, the, i, ching, was, originally, a, divination, manual, in, the, western, zhou, period, 1000, 750, bc, over, the, course, of, the, warring, states, and, early, imperial, periods, 500, 200, bc, it, transformed, into, a, cosmological, text, with, a, series, of, philosophical, commentaries, known, as, the, ten, wings, after, becoming, part, of, the, chinese, five, classics, in, the, 2nd, century, bc, the, i, ching, was, the, basis, for, divination, practice, for, centuries, across, the, far, east, and, was, the, subject, of, scholarly, commentary, between, the, 18th, and, 20th, centuries, it, took, on, an, influential, role, in, western, understanding, of, east, asian, philosophical, thought, as, a, divination, text, the, i, ching, is, used, for, a, chinese, form, of, cleromancy, known, as, i, ching, divination, in, which, bundles, of, yarrow, stalks, are, manipulated, to, produce, sets, of, six, apparently, random, numbers, ranging, from, 6, to, 9, each, of, the, 64, possible, sets, corresponds, to, a, hexagram, which, can, be, looked, up, in, the, i, ching, the, hexagrams, are, arranged, in, an, order, known, as, the, king, wen, sequence, the, interpretation, of, the, readings, found, in, the, i, ching, has, been, discussed, and, debated, over, the, centuries, many, commentators, have, used, the, book, symbolically, often, to, provide, guidance, for, moral, decision, making, as, informed, by, confucianism, taoism, and, buddhism, the, hexagrams, themselves, have, often, acquired, cosmological, significance, and, been, paralleled, with, many, other, traditional, names, for, the, processes, of, change, such, as, yin, and, yang, and, wu, xing, the, core, of, the, i, ching, is, a, western, zhou, divination, text, called, the, changes, of, zhou, chinese, pinyin, zh, u, y, modern, scholars, suggest, dates, ranging, between, the, 10th, and, 4th, centuries, bc, for, the, assembly, of, the, text, in, approximately, its, current, form, based, on, a, comparison, of, the, language, of, the, zhou, yi, with, dated, bronze, inscriptions, the, american, sinologist, edward, shaughnessy, dated, its, compilation, in, its, current, form, to, the, last, quarter, of, the, 9th, century, bc, during, the, early, decades, of, the, reign, of, king, xuan, of, zhou, r, c, 827, 782, bc, a, copy, of, the, text, in, the, shanghai, museum, corpus, of, bamboo, and, wooden, slips, discovered, in, 1994, shows, that, the, zhou, yi, was, used, throughout, all, levels, of, chinese, society, in, its, current, form, by, 300, bc, but, still, contained, small, variations, as, late, as, the, warring, states, period, c, 475, 221, bc, it, is, possible, that, other, divination, systems, existed, at, this, time, the, rites, of, zhou, name, two, other, such, systems, the, lianshan, and, the, guicang, the, name, zhou, yi, literally, means, the, changes, y, of, the, zhou, dynasty, the, changes, involved, have, been, interpreted, as, the, transformations, of, hexagrams, of, their, lines, or, of, the, numbers, obtained, from, the, divination, feng, youlan, proposed, that, the, word, for, changes, originally, meant, easy, as, in, a, form, of, divination, easier, than, the, oracle, bones, but, there, is, little, evidence, for, this, there, is, also, an, ancient, folk, etymology, that, sees, the, character, for, changes, as, containing, the, sun, and, moon, the, cycle, of, the, day, modern, sinologists, believe, the, character, to, be, derived, either, from, an, image, of, the, sun, emerging, from, clouds, or, from, the, content, of, a, vessel, being, changed, into, another, the, zhou, yi, was, traditionally, ascribed, to, the, zhou, cultural, heroes, king, wen, of, zhou, and, the, duke, of, zhou, and, was, also, associated, with, the, legendary, world, ruler, fuxi, according, to, the, canonical, great, commentary, fuxi, observed, the, patterns, of, the, world, and, created, the, eight, trigrams, b, gu, in, order, to, become, thoroughly, conversant, with, the, numinous, and, bright, and, to, classify, the, myriad, things, the, zhou, yi, itself, does, not, contain, this, legend, and, indeed, says, nothing, about, its, own, origins, the, rites, of, zhou, however, also, claims, that, the, hexagrams, of, the, zhou, yi, were, derived, from, an, initial, set, of, eight, trigrams, during, the, han, dynasty, there, were, various, opinions, about, the, historical, relationship, between, the, trigrams, and, the, hexagrams, eventually, a, consensus, formed, around, 2nd, century, ad, scholar, ma, rong, s, attribution, of, the, text, to, the, joint, work, of, fuxi, king, wen, of, zhou, the, duke, of, zhou, and, confucius, but, this, traditional, attribution, is, no, longer, generally, accepted, another, tradition, about, the, i, ching, was, that, most, of, it, was, written, by, tang, of, shang, the, basic, unit, of, the, zhou, yi, is, the, hexagram, gu, a, figure, composed, of, six, stacked, horizontal, lines, y, o, each, line, is, either, broken, or, unbroken, the, received, text, of, the, zhou, yi, contains, all, 64, possible, hexagrams, along, with, the, hexagram, s, name, gu, m, ng, a, short, hexagram, statement, tu, n, and, six, line, statements, y, oc, the, statements, were, used, to, determine, the, results, of, divination, but, the, reasons, for, having, two, different, methods, of, reading, the, hexagram, are, not, known, and, it, is, not, known, why, hexagram, statements, would, be, read, over, line, statements, or, vice, versa, the, book, opens, with, the, first, hexagram, statement, yu, n, h, ng, l, zh, n, these, four, words, are, often, repeated, in, the, hexagram, statements, and, were, already, considered, an, important, part, of, i, ching, interpretation, in, the, 6th, century, bc, edward, shaughnessy, describes, this, statement, as, affirming, an, initial, receipt, of, an, offering, beneficial, for, further, divining, the, word, zh, n, ancient, form, was, also, used, for, the, verb, divine, in, the, oracle, bones, of, the, late, shang, dynasty, which, preceded, the, zhou, it, also, carried, meanings, of, being, or, making, upright, or, correct, and, was, defined, by, the, eastern, han, scholar, zheng, xuan, as, to, enquire, into, the, correctness, of, a, proposed, activity, the, names, of, the, hexagrams, are, usually, words, that, appear, in, their, respective, line, statements, but, in, five, cases, 2, 9, 26, 61, and, 63, an, unrelated, character, of, unclear, purpose, appears, the, hexagram, names, could, have, been, chosen, arbitrarily, from, the, line, statements, but, it, is, also, possible, that, the, line, statements, were, derived, from, the, hexagram, names, the, line, statements, which, make, up, most, of, the, book, are, exceedingly, cryptic, each, line, begins, with, a, word, indicating, the, line, number, base, 2, 3, 4, 5, top, and, either, the, number, 6, for, a, broken, line, or, the, number, 9, for, a, whole, line, hexagrams, 1, and, 2, have, an, extra, line, statement, named, yong, following, the, line, number, the, line, statements, may, make, oracular, or, prognostic, statements, some, line, statements, also, contain, poetry, or, references, to, historical, events, archaeological, evidence, shows, that, zhou, dynasty, divination, was, grounded, in, cleromancy, the, production, of, seemingly, random, numbers, to, determine, divine, intent, the, zhou, yi, provided, a, guide, to, cleromancy, that, used, the, stalks, of, the, yarrow, plant, but, it, is, not, known, how, the, yarrow, stalks, became, numbers, or, how, specific, lines, were, chosen, from, the, line, readings, in, the, hexagrams, broken, lines, were, used, as, shorthand, for, the, numbers, 6, and, 8, and, solid, lines, were, shorthand, for, values, of, 7, and, 9, the, great, commentary, contains, a, late, classic, description, of, a, process, where, various, numerological, operations, are, performed, on, a, bundle, of, 50, stalks, leaving, remainders, of, 6, to, 9, like, the, zhou, yi, itself, yarrow, stalk, divination, dates, to, the, western, zhou, period, although, its, modern, form, is, a, reconstruction, the, ancient, narratives, zuo, zhuan, and, guoyu, contain, the, oldest, descriptions, of, divination, using, the, zhou, yi, the, two, histories, describe, more, than, twenty, successful, divinations, conducted, by, professional, soothsayers, for, royal, families, between, 671, and, 487, bc, the, method, of, divination, is, not, explained, and, none, of, the, stories, employ, predetermined, commentaries, patterns, or, interpretations, only, the, hexagrams, and, line, statements, are, used, by, the, 4th, century, bc, the, authority, of, the, zhou, yi, was, also, cited, for, rhetorical, purposes, without, relation, to, any, stated, divination, the, zuo, zhuan, does, not, contain, records, of, private, individuals, but, qin, dynasty, records, found, at, shuihudi, show, that, the, hexagrams, were, privately, consulted, to, answer, questions, such, as, business, health, children, and, determining, lucky, days, the, most, common, form, of, divination, with, the, i, ching, in, use, today, is, a, reconstruction, of, the, method, described, in, these, histories, in, the, 300, bc, great, commentary, and, later, in, the, huainanzi, and, the, lunheng, from, the, great, commentary, s, description, the, neo, confucian, zhu, xi, reconstructed, a, method, of, yarrow, stalk, divination, that, is, still, used, throughout, the, far, east, in, the, modern, period, gao, heng, attempted, his, own, reconstruction, which, varies, from, zhu, xi, in, places, another, divination, method, employing, coins, became, widely, used, in, the, tang, dynasty, and, is, still, used, today, in, the, modern, period, alternative, methods, such, as, specialized, dice, and, cartomancy, have, also, appeared, in, the, zuo, zhuan, stories, individual, lines, of, hexagrams, are, denoted, by, using, the, genitive, particle, zhi, followed, by, the, name, of, another, hexagram, where, that, specific, line, had, another, form, in, later, attempts, to, reconstruct, ancient, divination, methods, the, word, zhi, was, interpreted, as, a, verb, meaning, moving, to, an, apparent, indication, that, hexagrams, could, be, transformed, into, other, hexagrams, however, there, are, no, instances, of, changeable, lines, in, the, zuo, zhuan, in, all, 12, out, of, 12, line, statements, quoted, the, original, hexagrams, are, used, to, produce, the, oracle, in, 136, bc, emperor, wu, of, han, named, the, zhou, yi, the, first, among, the, classics, dubbing, it, the, classic, of, changes, or, i, ching, emperor, wu, s, placement, of, the, i, ching, among, the, five, classics, was, informed, by, a, broad, span, of, cultural, influences, that, included, confucianism, taoism, legalism, yin, yang, cosmology, and, wu, xing, physical, theory, while, the, zhou, yi, does, not, contain, any, cosmological, analogies, the, i, ching, was, read, as, a, microcosm, of, the, universe, that, offered, complex, symbolic, correspondences, the, official, edition, of, the, text, was, literally, set, in, stone, as, one, of, the, xiping, stone, classics, the, canonized, i, ching, became, the, standard, text, for, over, two, thousand, years, until, alternate, versions, of, the, zhou, yi, and, related, texts, were, discovered, in, the, 20th, century, part, of, the, canonization, of, the, zhou, yi, bound, it, to, a, set, of, ten, commentaries, called, the, ten, wings, the, ten, wings, are, of, a, much, later, provenance, than, the, zhou, yi, and, are, the, production, of, a, different, society, the, zhou, yi, was, written, in, early, old, chinese, while, the, ten, wings, were, written, in, a, predecessor, to, middle, chinese, the, specific, origins, of, the, ten, wings, are, still, a, complete, mystery, to, academics, regardless, of, their, historical, relation, to, the, text, the, philosophical, depth, of, the, ten, wings, made, the, i, ching, a, perfect, fit, to, han, period, confucian, scholarship, the, inclusion, of, the, ten, wings, reflects, a, widespread, recognition, in, ancient, china, found, in, the, zuo, zhuan, and, other, pre, han, texts, that, the, i, ching, was, a, rich, moral, and, symbolic, document, useful, for, more, than, professional, divination, arguably, the, most, important, of, the, ten, wings, is, the, great, commentary, dazhuan, or, xi, ci, which, dates, to, roughly, 300, bc, the, great, commentary, describes, the, i, ching, as, a, microcosm, of, the, universe, and, a, symbolic, description, of, the, processes, of, change, by, partaking, in, the, spiritual, experience, of, the, i, ching, the, great, commentary, states, the, individual, can, understand, the, deeper, patterns, of, the, universe, among, other, subjects, it, explains, how, the, eight, trigrams, proceeded, from, the, eternal, oneness, of, the, universe, through, three, bifurcations, the, other, wings, provide, different, perspectives, on, essentially, the, same, viewpoint, giving, ancient, cosmic, authority, to, the, i, ching, for, example, the, wenyan, provides, a, moral, interpretation, that, parallels, the, first, two, hexagrams, qi, n, and, k, n, with, heaven, and, earth, and, the, shuogua, attributes, to, the, symbolic, function, of, the, hexagrams, the, ability, to, understand, self, world, and, destiny, throughout, the, ten, wings, there, are, passages, that, seem, to, purposefully, increase, the, ambiguity, of, the, base, text, pointing, to, a, recognition, of, multiple, layers, of, symbolism, the, great, commentary, associates, knowledge, of, the, i, ching, with, the, ability, to, delight, in, heaven, and, understand, fate, the, sage, who, reads, it, will, see, cosmological, patterns, and, not, despair, in, mere, material, difficulties, the, japanese, word, for, metaphysics, keijij, gaku, is, derived, from, a, statement, found, in, the, great, commentary, that, what, is, above, form, is, called, tao, what, is, under, form, is, called, a, tool, the, word, has, also, been, borrowed, into, korean, and, re, borrowed, back, into, chinese, the, ten, wings, were, traditionally, attributed, to, confucius, possibly, based, on, a, misreading, of, the, records, of, the, grand, historian, although, it, rested, on, historically, shaky, grounds, the, association, of, the, i, ching, with, confucius, gave, weight, to, the, text, and, was, taken, as, an, article, of, faith, throughout, the, han, and, tang, dynasties, the, i, ching, was, not, included, in, the, burning, of, the, confucian, classics, and, textual, evidence, strongly, suggests, that, confucius, did, not, consider, the, zhou, yi, a, classic, an, ancient, commentary, on, the, zhou, yi, found, at, mawangdui, portrays, confucius, as, endorsing, it, as, a, source, of, wisdom, first, and, an, imperfect, divination, text, second, however, since, the, ten, wings, became, canonized, by, emperor, wu, of, han, together, with, the, original, i, ching, as, the, zhou, yi, it, can, be, attributed, to, the, positions, of, influence, from, the, confucians, in, the, government, furthermore, the, ten, wings, tends, to, use, diction, and, phrases, such, as, the, master, said, which, was, previously, commonly, seen, in, the, analects, thereby, implying, the, heavy, involvement, of, confucians, in, its, creation, as, well, as, institutionalization, in, the, canonical, i, ching, the, hexagrams, are, arranged, in, an, order, dubbed, the, king, wen, sequence, after, king, wen, of, zhou, who, founded, the, zhou, dynasty, and, supposedly, reformed, the, method, of, interpretation, the, sequence, generally, pairs, hexagrams, with, their, upside, down, equivalents, the, eight, hexagrams, that, do, not, change, when, turned, upside, down, are, instead, paired, with, their, inversions, exchanging, yin, and, yang, lines, another, order, found, at, mawangdui, in, 1973, arranges, the, hexagrams, into, eight, groups, sharing, the, same, upper, trigram, but, the, oldest, known, manuscript, found, in, 1987, and, now, held, by, the, shanghai, library, was, almost, certainly, arranged, in, the, king, wen, sequence, and, it, has, even, been, proposed, that, a, pottery, paddle, from, the, western, zhou, period, contains, four, hexagrams, in, the, king, wen, sequence, whichever, of, these, arrangements, is, older, it, is, not, evident, that, the, order, of, the, hexagrams, was, of, interest, to, the, original, authors, of, the, zhou, yi, the, assignment, of, numbers, binary, or, decimal, to, specific, hexagrams, is, a, modern, invention, yin, and, yang, are, represented, by, broken, and, solid, lines, yin, is, broken, and, yang, is, solid, different, constructions, of, three, yin, and, yang, lines, lead, to, eight, trigrams, namely, qian, dui, li, zhen, xun, kan, gen, and, kun, the, different, combinations, of, the, two, trigrams, lead, to, 64, hexagrams, the, following, table, numbers, the, hexagrams, in, king, wen, order, the, sinologist, michael, nylan, describes, the, i, ching, as, the, best, known, chinese, book, in, the, world, eliot, weinberger, wrote, that, it, is, the, most, recognized, chinese, book, in, east, asia, it, is, a, foundational, text, for, the, confucian, and, daoist, philosophical, traditions, while, in, the, west, it, attracted, the, attention, of, enlightenment, intellectuals, and, prominent, literary, and, cultural, figures, during, the, eastern, han, i, ching, interpretation, divided, into, two, schools, originating, in, a, dispute, over, minor, differences, between, different, editions, of, the, received, text, the, first, school, known, as, new, text, criticism, was, more, egalitarian, and, eclectic, and, sought, to, find, symbolic, and, numerological, parallels, between, the, natural, world, and, the, hexagrams, their, commentaries, provided, the, basis, of, the, school, of, images, and, numbers, the, other, school, old, text, criticism, was, more, scholarly, and, hierarchical, and, focused, on, the, moral, content, of, the, text, providing, the, basis, for, the, school, of, meanings, and, principles, the, new, text, scholars, distributed, alternate, versions, of, the, text, and, freely, integrated, non, canonical, commentaries, into, their, work, as, well, as, propagating, alternate, systems, of, divination, such, as, the, taixuanjing, most, of, this, early, commentary, such, as, the, image, and, number, work, of, jing, fang, yu, fan, and, xun, shuang, is, no, longer, extant, only, short, fragments, survive, from, a, tang, dynasty, text, called, zhou, yi, jijie, with, the, fall, of, the, han, i, ching, scholarship, was, no, longer, organized, into, systematic, schools, the, most, influential, writer, of, this, period, was, wang, bi, who, discarded, the, numerology, of, han, commentators, and, integrated, the, philosophy, of, the, ten, wings, directly, into, the, central, text, of, the, i, ching, creating, such, a, persuasive, narrative, that, han, commentators, were, no, longer, considered, significant, a, century, later, han, kangbo, added, commentaries, on, the, ten, wings, to, wang, bi, s, book, creating, a, text, called, the, zhouyi, zhu, the, principal, rival, interpretation, was, a, practical, text, on, divination, by, the, soothsayer, guan, lu, at, the, beginning, of, the, tang, dynasty, emperor, taizong, of, tang, ordered, kong, yingda, to, create, a, canonical, edition, of, the, i, ching, choosing, wang, bi, s, 3rd, century, annotated, book, of, changes, zh, uy, zh, as, the, official, commentary, he, added, to, it, further, commentary, drawing, out, the, subtler, details, of, wang, bi, s, explanations, the, resulting, right, meaning, of, the, book, of, changes, zh, uy, zh, ngy, became, the, standard, edition, of, the, i, ching, through, the, song, dynasty, by, the, 11th, century, the, i, ching, was, being, read, as, a, work, of, intricate, philosophy, as, a, jumping, off, point, for, examining, great, metaphysical, questions, and, ethical, issues, cheng, yi, patriarch, of, the, neo, confucian, cheng, zhu, school, read, the, i, ching, as, a, guide, to, moral, perfection, he, described, the, text, as, a, way, to, for, ministers, to, form, honest, political, factions, root, out, corruption, and, solve, problems, in, government, the, contemporary, scholar, shao, yong, rearranged, the, hexagrams, in, a, format, that, resembles, modern, binary, numbers, although, he, did, not, intend, his, arrangement, to, be, used, mathematically, this, arrangement, sometimes, called, the, binary, sequence, later, inspired, gottfried, leibniz, the, 12th, century, neo, confucian, zhu, xi, co, founder, of, the, cheng, zhu, school, criticized, both, of, the, han, dynasty, lines, of, commentary, on, the, i, ching, saying, that, they, were, one, sided, he, developed, a, synthesis, of, the, two, arguing, that, the, text, was, primarily, a, work, of, divination, that, could, be, used, in, the, process, of, moral, self, cultivation, or, what, the, ancients, called, rectification, of, the, mind, in, the, great, learning, zhu, xi, s, reconstruction, of, i, ching, yarrow, stalk, divination, based, in, part, on, the, great, commentary, account, became, the, standard, form, and, is, still, in, use, today, as, china, entered, the, early, modern, period, the, i, ching, took, on, renewed, relevance, in, both, confucian, and, daoist, studies, the, kangxi, emperor, was, especially, fond, of, the, i, ching, and, ordered, new, interpretations, of, it, qing, dynasty, scholars, focused, more, intently, on, understanding, pre, classical, grammar, assisting, the, development, of, new, philological, approaches, in, the, modern, period, like, the, other, chinese, classics, the, i, ching, was, an, influential, text, across, east, asia, in, 1557, the, korean, neo, confucianist, philosopher, yi, hwang, produced, one, of, the, most, influential, i, ching, studies, of, the, early, modern, era, claiming, that, the, spirit, was, a, principle, li, and, not, a, material, force, qi, hwang, accused, the, neo, confucian, school, of, having, misread, zhu, xi, his, critique, proved, influential, not, only, in, korea, but, also, in, japan, other, than, this, contribution, the, i, ching, known, in, korean, as, the, yeok, gyeong, was, not, central, to, the, development, of, korean, confucianism, and, by, the, 19th, century, i, ching, studies, were, integrated, into, the, silhak, reform, movement, in, medieval, japan, secret, teachings, on, the, i, ching, known, in, japanese, as, the, eki, ky, were, publicized, by, rinzai, zen, master, kokan, shiren, and, the, shintoist, yoshida, kanetomo, during, the, kamakura, era, i, ching, studies, in, japan, took, on, new, importance, during, the, edo, period, during, which, over, 1, 000, books, were, published, on, the, subject, by, over, 400, authors, the, majority, of, these, books, were, serious, works, of, philology, reconstructing, ancient, usages, and, commentaries, for, practical, purposes, a, sizable, minority, focused, on, numerology, symbolism, and, divination, during, this, time, over, 150, editions, of, earlier, chinese, commentaries, were, reprinted, across, edo, japan, including, several, texts, that, had, become, lost, in, china, in, the, early, edo, period, japanese, writers, such, as, it, jinsai, kumazawa, banzan, and, nakae, t, ju, ranked, the, i, ching, the, greatest, of, the, confucian, classics, many, writers, attempted, to, use, the, i, ching, to, explain, western, science, in, a, japanese, framework, one, writer, shizuki, tadao, even, attempted, to, employ, newton, s, laws, of, motion, and, the, copernican, principle, within, an, i, ching, cosmology, this, line, of, argument, was, later, taken, up, in, china, by, the, qing, politician, zhang, zhidong, gottfried, wilhelm, leibniz, who, was, corresponding, with, jesuits, in, china, wrote, the, first, european, commentary, on, the, i, ching, in, 1703, he, argued, that, it, proved, the, universality, of, binary, numbers, and, theism, since, the, broken, lines, the, 0, or, nothingness, cannot, become, solid, lines, the, 1, or, oneness, without, the, intervention, of, god, this, was, criticized, by, georg, friedrich, hegel, who, proclaimed, that, binary, system, and, chinese, characters, were, empty, forms, that, could, not, articulate, spoken, words, with, the, clarity, of, the, western, alphabet, in, their, commentary, i, ching, hexagrams, and, chinese, characters, were, conflated, into, a, single, foreign, idea, sparking, a, dialogue, on, western, philosophical, questions, such, as, universality, and, the, nature, of, communication, the, usage, of, binary, in, relation, to, the, i, ching, was, central, to, leibniz, s, characteristica, universalis, or, universal, language, which, in, turn, inspired, the, standards, of, boolean, logic, and, for, gottlob, frege, to, develop, predicate, logic, in, the, late, 19th, century, in, the, 20th, century, jacques, derrida, identified, hegel, s, argument, as,
