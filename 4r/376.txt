20th, century, classical, music, is, art, music, that, was, written, between, the, years, 1901, and, 2000, inclusive, musical, style, diverged, during, the, 20th, century, as, it, never, had, previously, so, this, century, was, without, a, dominant, style, modernism, impressionism, and, post, romanticism, can, all, be, traced, to, the, decades, before, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, but, can, be, included, because, they, evolved, beyond, the, musical, boundaries, of, the, 19th, century, styles, that, were, part, of, the, earlier, common, practice, period, neoclassicism, and, expressionism, came, mostly, after, 1900, minimalism, started, much, later, in, the, century, and, can, be, seen, as, a, change, from, the, modern, to, postmodern, era, although, some, date, postmodernism, from, as, early, as, about, 1930, aleatory, atonality, serialism, musique, concr, te, and, electronic, music, were, all, developed, during, the, century, jazz, and, ethnic, folk, music, became, important, influences, on, many, composers, during, this, century, at, the, turn, of, the, century, music, was, characteristically, late, romantic, in, style, composers, such, as, gustav, mahler, richard, strauss, and, jean, sibelius, were, pushing, the, bounds, of, post, romantic, symphonic, writing, at, the, same, time, the, impressionist, movement, spearheaded, by, claude, debussy, was, being, developed, in, france, debussy, in, fact, loathed, the, term, impressionism, i, am, trying, to, do, something, different, in, a, way, realities, what, the, imbeciles, call, impressionism, is, a, term, which, is, as, poorly, used, as, possible, particularly, by, art, critics, maurice, ravel, s, music, also, often, labelled, as, impressionist, explores, music, in, many, styles, not, always, related, to, it, see, the, discussion, on, neoclassicism, below, many, composers, reacted, to, the, post, romantic, and, impressionist, styles, and, moved, in, quite, different, directions, the, single, most, important, moment, in, defining, the, course, of, music, throughout, the, century, was, the, widespread, break, with, traditional, tonality, effected, in, diverse, ways, by, different, composers, in, the, first, decade, of, the, century, from, this, sprang, an, unprecedented, linguistic, plurality, of, styles, techniques, and, expression, in, vienna, arnold, schoenberg, developed, atonality, out, of, the, expressionism, that, arose, in, the, early, part, of, the, 20th, century, he, later, developed, the, twelve, tone, technique, which, was, developed, further, by, his, disciples, alban, berg, and, anton, webern, later, composers, including, pierre, boulez, developed, it, further, still, stravinsky, in, his, last, works, explored, twelve, tone, technique, too, as, did, many, other, composers, indeed, even, scott, bradley, used, the, technique, in, his, scores, for, the, tom, and, jerry, cartoons, after, the, first, world, war, many, composers, started, returning, to, the, past, for, inspiration, and, wrote, works, that, draw, elements, form, harmony, melody, structure, from, it, this, type, of, music, thus, became, labelled, neoclassicism, igor, stravinsky, pulcinella, sergei, prokofiev, classical, symphony, ravel, le, tombeau, de, couperin, manuel, de, falla, el, retablo, de, maese, pedro, and, paul, hindemith, symphony, mathis, der, maler, all, produced, neoclassical, works, italian, composers, such, as, francesco, balilla, pratella, and, luigi, russolo, developed, musical, futurism, this, style, often, tried, to, recreate, everyday, sounds, and, place, them, in, a, futurist, context, the, machine, music, of, george, antheil, starting, with, his, second, sonata, the, airplane, and, alexander, mosolov, most, notoriously, his, iron, foundry, developed, out, of, this, the, process, of, extending, musical, vocabulary, by, exploring, all, available, tones, was, pushed, further, by, the, use, of, microtones, in, works, by, charles, ives, juli, n, carrillo, alois, h, ba, john, foulds, ivan, wyschnegradsky, harry, partch, and, mildred, couper, among, many, others, microtones, are, those, intervals, that, are, smaller, than, a, semitone, human, voices, and, unfretted, strings, can, easily, produce, them, by, going, in, between, the, normal, notes, but, other, instruments, will, have, more, difficulty, the, piano, and, organ, have, no, way, of, producing, them, at, all, aside, from, retuning, and, or, major, reconstruction, in, the, 1940s, and, 50s, composers, notably, pierre, schaeffer, started, to, explore, the, application, of, technology, to, music, in, musique, concr, te, the, term, electroacoustic, music, was, later, coined, to, include, all, forms, of, music, involving, magnetic, tape, computers, synthesizers, multimedia, and, other, electronic, devices, and, techniques, live, electronic, music, uses, live, electronic, sounds, within, a, performance, as, opposed, to, preprocessed, sounds, that, are, overdubbed, during, a, performance, john, cage, s, cartridge, music, being, an, early, example, spectral, music, g, rard, grisey, and, tristan, murail, is, a, further, development, of, electroacoustic, music, that, uses, analyses, of, sound, spectra, to, create, music, cage, berio, boulez, milton, babbitt, luigi, nono, and, edgard, var, se, all, wrote, electroacoustic, music, from, the, early, 1950s, onwards, cage, introduced, elements, of, chance, into, his, music, process, music, karlheinz, stockhausen, prozession, aus, den, sieben, tagen, and, steve, reich, piano, phase, clapping, music, explores, a, particular, process, which, is, essentially, laid, bare, in, the, work, the, term, experimental, music, was, coined, by, cage, to, describe, works, that, produce, unpredictable, results, according, to, the, definition, an, experimental, action, is, one, the, outcome, of, which, is, not, foreseen, the, term, is, also, used, to, describe, music, within, specific, genres, that, pushes, against, their, boundaries, or, definitions, or, else, whose, approach, is, a, hybrid, of, disparate, styles, or, incorporates, unorthodox, new, distinctly, unique, ingredients, important, cultural, trends, often, informed, music, of, this, period, romantic, modernist, neoclassical, postmodernist, or, otherwise, igor, stravinsky, and, sergei, prokofiev, were, particularly, drawn, to, primitivism, in, their, early, careers, as, explored, in, works, such, as, the, rite, of, spring, and, chout, other, russians, notably, dmitri, shostakovich, reflected, the, social, impact, of, communism, and, subsequently, had, to, work, within, the, strictures, of, socialist, realism, in, their, music, other, composers, such, as, benjamin, britten, war, requiem, explored, political, themes, in, their, works, albeit, entirely, at, their, own, volition, nationalism, was, also, an, important, means, of, expression, in, the, early, part, of, the, century, the, culture, of, the, united, states, of, america, especially, began, informing, an, american, vernacular, style, of, classical, music, notably, in, the, works, of, charles, ives, john, alden, carpenter, and, later, george, gershwin, folk, music, vaughan, williams, five, variants, of, dives, and, lazarus, gustav, holst, s, a, somerset, rhapsody, and, jazz, gershwin, leonard, bernstein, darius, milhaud, s, la, cr, ation, du, monde, were, also, influential, in, the, last, quarter, of, the, century, eclecticism, and, polystylism, became, important, these, as, well, as, minimalism, new, complexity, and, new, simplicity, are, more, fully, explored, in, their, respective, articles, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, often, called, the, fin, de, si, cle, the, romantic, style, was, starting, to, break, apart, moving, along, various, parallel, courses, such, as, impressionism, and, post, romanticism, in, the, 20th, century, the, different, styles, that, emerged, from, the, music, of, the, previous, century, influenced, composers, to, follow, new, trends, sometimes, as, a, reaction, to, that, music, sometimes, as, an, extension, of, it, and, both, trends, co, existed, well, into, the, 20th, century, the, former, trends, such, as, expressionism, are, discussed, later, in, the, early, part, of, the, 20th, century, many, composers, wrote, music, which, was, an, extension, of, 19th, century, romantic, music, and, traditional, instrumental, groupings, such, as, the, orchestra, and, string, quartet, remained, the, most, typical, traditional, forms, such, as, the, symphony, and, concerto, remained, in, use, gustav, mahler, and, jean, sibelius, are, examples, of, composers, who, took, the, traditional, symphonic, forms, and, reworked, them, see, romantic, music, some, writers, hold, that, schoenberg, s, work, is, squarely, within, the, late, romantic, tradition, of, wagner, and, brahms, and, more, generally, that, the, composer, who, most, directly, and, completely, connects, late, wagner, and, the, 20th, century, is, arnold, schoenberg, neoclassicism, was, a, style, cultivated, between, the, two, world, wars, which, sought, to, revive, the, balanced, forms, and, clearly, perceptible, thematic, processes, of, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, in, a, repudiation, of, what, were, seen, as, exaggerated, gestures, and, formlessness, of, late, romanticism, because, these, composers, generally, replaced, the, functional, tonality, of, their, models, with, extended, tonality, modality, or, atonality, the, term, is, often, taken, to, imply, parody, or, distortion, of, the, baroque, or, classical, style, famous, examples, include, prokofiev, s, classical, symphony, and, stravinsky, s, pulcinella, symphony, of, psalms, and, concerto, in, e, flat, dumbarton, oaks, paul, hindemith, symphony, mathis, der, maler, darius, milhaud, francis, poulenc, concert, champ, tre, and, manuel, de, falla, el, retablo, de, maese, pedro, harpsichord, concerto, also, used, this, style, maurice, ravel, s, le, tombeau, de, couperin, is, often, seen, as, neo, baroque, an, architectural, term, though, the, distinction, between, the, terms, is, not, always, made, a, number, of, composers, combined, elements, of, the, jazz, idiom, with, classical, compositional, styles, notably, impressionism, started, in, france, as, a, reaction, led, by, claude, debussy, against, the, emotional, exuberance, and, epic, themes, of, german, romanticism, exemplified, by, wagner, in, debussy, s, view, art, was, a, sensuous, experience, rather, than, an, intellectual, or, ethical, one, he, urged, his, countrymen, to, rediscover, the, french, masters, of, the, 18th, century, for, whom, music, was, meant, to, charm, to, entertain, and, to, serve, as, a, fantasy, of, the, senses, other, composers, associated, with, impressionism, include, maurice, ravel, albert, roussel, isaac, alb, niz, paul, dukas, manuel, de, falla, charles, martin, loeffler, charles, griffes, frederick, delius, ottorino, respighi, cyril, scott, and, karol, szymanowski, many, french, composers, continued, impressionism, s, language, through, the, 1920s, and, later, including, albert, roussel, charles, koechlin, andr, caplet, and, later, olivier, messiaen, composers, from, non, western, cultures, such, as, t, ru, takemitsu, and, jazz, musicians, such, as, duke, ellington, gil, evans, art, tatum, and, cecil, taylor, also, have, been, strongly, influenced, by, the, impressionist, musical, language, at, its, conception, futurism, was, an, italian, artistic, movement, founded, in, 1909, by, filippo, tommaso, marinetti, it, was, quickly, embraced, by, the, russian, avant, garde, in, 1913, the, painter, luigi, russolo, published, a, manifesto, l, arte, dei, rumori, the, art, of, noises, calling, for, the, incorporation, of, noises, of, every, kind, into, music, in, addition, to, russolo, composers, directly, associated, with, this, movement, include, the, italians, silvio, mix, nuccio, fiorda, franco, casavola, and, pannigi, whose, 1922, ballo, meccanico, included, two, motorcycles, and, the, russians, artur, louri, mikhail, matyushin, and, nikolai, roslavets, though, few, of, the, futurist, works, of, these, composers, are, performed, today, the, influence, of, futurism, on, the, later, development, of, 20th, century, music, was, enormous, sergei, prokofiev, maurice, ravel, igor, stravinsky, arthur, honegger, george, antheil, leo, ornstein, and, edgard, var, se, are, among, the, notable, composers, in, the, first, half, of, the, century, who, were, influenced, by, futurism, characteristic, features, of, later, 20th, century, music, with, origins, in, futurism, include, the, prepared, piano, integral, serialism, extended, vocal, techniques, graphic, notation, improvisation, and, minimalism, in, the, early, part, of, the, 20th, century, charles, ives, integrated, american, and, european, traditions, as, well, as, vernacular, and, church, styles, while, using, innovative, techniques, in, his, rhythm, harmony, and, form, his, technique, included, the, use, of, polytonality, polyrhythm, tone, clusters, aleatoric, elements, and, quarter, tones, edgard, var, se, wrote, highly, dissonant, pieces, that, utilized, unusual, sonorities, and, futuristic, scientific, sounding, names, he, pioneered, the, use, of, new, instruments, and, electronic, resources, see, below, by, the, late, 1920s, though, many, composers, continued, to, write, in, a, vaguely, expressionist, manner, it, was, being, supplanted, by, the, more, impersonal, style, of, the, german, neue, sachlichkeit, and, neoclassicism, because, expressionism, like, any, movement, that, had, been, stigmatized, by, the, nazis, gained, a, sympathetic, reconsideration, following, world, war, ii, expressionist, music, resurfaced, in, works, by, composers, such, as, hans, werner, henze, pierre, boulez, peter, maxwell, davies, wolfgang, rihm, and, bernd, alois, zimmermann, postmodernism, is, a, reaction, to, modernism, but, it, can, also, be, viewed, as, a, response, to, a, deep, seated, shift, in, societal, attitude, according, to, this, latter, view, postmodernism, began, when, historic, as, opposed, to, personal, optimism, turned, to, pessimism, at, the, latest, by, 1930, john, cage, is, a, prominent, figure, in, 20th, century, music, claimed, with, some, justice, both, for, modernism, and, postmodernism, because, the, complex, intersections, between, modernism, and, postmodernism, are, not, reducible, to, simple, schemata, his, influence, steadily, grew, during, his, lifetime, he, often, uses, elements, of, chance, imaginary, landscape, no, 4, for, 12, radio, receivers, and, music, of, changes, for, piano, sonatas, and, interludes, 1946, 48, is, composed, for, a, prepared, piano, a, normal, piano, whose, timbre, is, dramatically, altered, by, carefully, placing, various, objects, inside, the, piano, in, contact, with, the, strings, currently, postmodernism, includes, composers, who, react, against, the, avant, garde, and, experimental, styles, of, the, late, 20th, century, such, as, astor, piazzolla, argentina, and, miguel, del, guila, usa, in, the, later, 20th, century, composers, such, as, la, monte, young, arvo, p, rt, philip, glass, terry, riley, steve, reich, and, john, adams, began, to, explore, what, is, now, called, minimalism, in, which, the, work, is, stripped, down, to, its, most, fundamental, features, the, music, often, features, repetition, and, iteration, an, early, example, is, terry, riley, s, in, c, 1964, an, aleatoric, work, in, which, short, phrases, are, chosen, by, the, musicians, from, a, set, list, and, played, an, arbitrary, number, of, times, while, the, note, c, is, repeated, in, eighth, notes, quavers, behind, them, steve, reich, s, works, piano, phase, 1967, for, two, pianos, and, drumming, 1970, 71, for, percussion, female, voices, and, piccolo, employ, the, technique, called, phasing, in, which, a, phrase, played, by, one, player, maintaining, a, constant, pace, is, played, simultaneously, by, another, but, at, a, slightly, quicker, pace, this, causes, the, players, to, go, out, of, phase, with, each, other, and, the, performance, may, continue, until, they, come, back, in, phase, according, to, reich, drumming, is, the, final, expansion, and, refinement, of, the, phasing, process, as, well, as, the, first, use, of, four, new, techniques, 1, the, process, of, gradually, substituting, beats, for, rests, or, rests, for, beats, 2, the, gradual, changing, of, timbre, while, rhythm, and, pitch, remain, constant, 3, the, simultaneous, combination, of, instruments, of, different, timbre, and, 4, the, use, of, the, human, voice, to, become, part, of, the, musical, ensemble, by, imitating, the, exact, sound, of, the, instruments, drumming, was, reich, s, final, use, of, the, phasing, technique, philip, glass, s, 1, 1, 1968, employs, the, additive, process, in, which, short, phrases, are, slowly, expanded, la, monte, young, s, compositions, 1960, employs, very, long, tones, exceptionally, high, volumes, and, extra, musical, techniques, such, as, draw, a, straight, line, and, follow, it, or, build, a, fire, michael, nyman, argues, that, minimalism, was, a, reaction, to, and, made, possible, by, both, serialism, and, indeterminism, see, also, experimental, music, arnold, schoenberg, is, one, of, the, most, significant, figures, in, 20th, century, music, while, his, early, works, were, in, a, late, romantic, style, influenced, by, wagner, verkl, rte, nacht, 1899, this, evolved, into, an, atonal, idiom, in, the, years, before, the, first, world, war, drei, klavierst, cke, in, 1909, and, pierrot, lunaire, in, 1912, in, 1921, after, several, years, of, research, he, developed, the, twelve, tone, technique, of, composition, which, he, first, described, privately, to, his, associates, in, 1923, his, first, large, scale, work, entirely, composed, using, this, technique, was, the, wind, quintet, op, 26, written, in, 1923, 24, later, examples, include, the, variations, for, orchestra, op, 31, 1926, 28, the, third, and, fourth, string, quartets, 1927, and, 1936, respectively, the, violin, concerto, 1936, and, piano, concerto, 1942, in, later, years, he, intermittently, returned, to, a, more, tonal, style, kammersymphonie, no, 2, begun, in, 1906, but, completed, only, in, 1939, variations, on, a, recitative, for, organ, in, 1941, he, taught, anton, webern, and, alban, berg, and, these, three, composers, are, often, referred, to, as, the, principal, members, of, the, second, viennese, school, haydn, mozart, and, beethoven, and, sometimes, schubert, being, regarded, as, the, first, viennese, school, in, this, context, webern, wrote, works, using, a, rigorous, twelve, tone, method, and, influenced, the, development, of, total, serialism, berg, like, schoenberg, employed, twelve, tone, technique, within, a, late, romantic, or, post, romantic, style, violin, concerto, which, quotes, a, bach, choral, and, uses, classical, form, he, wrote, two, major, operas, wozzeck, and, lulu, the, development, of, recording, technology, made, all, sounds, available, for, potential, use, as, musical, material, electronic, music, generally, refers, to, a, repertory, of, art, music, developed, in, the, 1950s, in, europe, japan, and, the, americas, the, increasing, availability, of, magnetic, tape, in, this, decade, provided, composers, with, a, medium, which, allowed, recording, sounds, and, then, manipulating, them, in, various, ways, all, electronic, music, depends, on, transmission, via, loudspeakers, but, there, are, two, broad, types, acousmatic, music, which, exists, only, in, recorded, form, meant, for, loudspeaker, listening, and, live, electronic, music, in, which, electronic, apparatus, are, used, to, generate, transform, or, trigger, sounds, during, performance, by, musicians, using, voices, traditional, instruments, electro, acoustic, instruments, or, other, devices, beginning, in, 1957, computers, became, increasingly, important, in, this, field, when, the, source, material, was, acoustical, sounds, from, the, everyday, world, the, term, musique, concr, te, was, used, when, the, sounds, were, produced, by, electronic, generators, it, was, designated, electronic, music, after, the, 1950s, the, term, electronic, music, came, to, be, used, for, both, types, sometimes, such, electronic, music, was, combined, with, more, conventional, instruments, edgard, var, se, s, d, serts, 1954,
