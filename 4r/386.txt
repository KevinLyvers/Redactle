electronic, music, broadly, is, a, group, of, music, genres, that, employ, electronic, musical, instruments, circuitry, based, music, technology, and, software, or, general, purpose, electronics, such, as, personal, computers, in, its, creation, it, includes, both, music, made, using, electronic, and, electromechanical, means, electroacoustic, music, pure, electronic, instruments, depended, entirely, on, circuitry, based, sound, generation, for, instance, using, devices, such, as, an, electronic, oscillator, theremin, or, synthesizer, electromechanical, instruments, can, have, mechanical, parts, such, as, strings, hammers, and, electric, elements, including, magnetic, pickups, power, amplifiers, and, loudspeakers, such, electromechanical, devices, include, the, telharmonium, hammond, organ, electric, piano, and, electric, guitar, the, first, electronic, musical, devices, were, developed, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, during, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, some, electronic, instruments, were, introduced, and, the, first, compositions, featuring, them, were, written, by, the, 1940s, magnetic, audio, tape, allowed, musicians, to, tape, sounds, and, then, modify, them, by, changing, the, tape, speed, or, direction, leading, to, the, development, of, electroacoustic, tape, music, in, the, 1940s, in, egypt, and, france, musique, concr, te, created, in, paris, in, 1948, was, based, on, editing, together, recorded, fragments, of, natural, and, industrial, sounds, music, produced, solely, from, electronic, generators, was, first, produced, in, germany, in, 1953, by, karlheinz, stockhausen, electronic, music, was, also, created, in, japan, and, the, united, states, beginning, in, the, 1950s, and, algorithmic, composition, with, computers, was, first, demonstrated, in, the, same, decade, during, the, 1960s, digital, computer, music, was, pioneered, innovation, in, live, electronics, took, place, and, japanese, electronic, musical, instruments, began, to, influence, the, music, industry, in, the, early, 1970s, moog, synthesizers, and, drum, machines, helped, popularize, synthesized, electronic, music, the, 1970s, also, saw, electronic, music, begin, to, have, a, significant, influence, on, popular, music, with, the, adoption, of, polyphonic, synthesizers, electronic, drums, drum, machines, and, turntables, through, the, emergence, of, genres, such, as, disco, krautrock, new, wave, synth, pop, hip, hop, and, edm, in, the, early, 1980s, mass, produced, digital, synthesizers, such, as, the, yamaha, dx7, became, popular, and, midi, musical, instrument, digital, interface, was, developed, in, the, same, decade, with, a, greater, reliance, on, synthesizers, and, the, adoption, of, programmable, drum, machines, electronic, popular, music, came, to, the, fore, during, the, 1990s, with, the, proliferation, of, increasingly, affordable, music, technology, electronic, music, production, became, an, established, part, of, popular, culture, in, berlin, starting, in, 1989, the, love, parade, became, the, largest, street, party, with, over, 1, million, visitors, inspiring, other, such, popular, celebrations, of, electronic, music, contemporary, electronic, music, includes, many, varieties, and, ranges, from, experimental, art, music, to, popular, forms, such, as, electronic, dance, music, pop, electronic, music, is, most, recognizable, in, its, 4, 4, form, and, more, connected, with, the, mainstream, than, preceding, forms, which, were, popular, in, niche, markets, at, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, experimentation, with, emerging, electronics, led, to, the, first, electronic, musical, instruments, these, initial, inventions, were, not, sold, but, were, instead, used, in, demonstrations, and, public, performances, the, audiences, were, presented, with, reproductions, of, existing, music, instead, of, new, compositions, for, the, instruments, while, some, were, considered, novelties, and, produced, simple, tones, the, telharmonium, synthesized, the, sound, of, several, orchestral, instruments, with, reasonable, precision, it, achieved, viable, public, interest, and, made, commercial, progress, into, streaming, music, through, telephone, networks, critics, of, musical, conventions, at, the, time, saw, promise, in, these, developments, ferruccio, busoni, encouraged, the, composition, of, microtonal, music, allowed, for, by, electronic, instruments, he, predicted, the, use, of, machines, in, future, music, writing, the, influential, sketch, of, a, new, esthetic, of, music, 1907, futurists, such, as, francesco, balilla, pratella, and, luigi, russolo, began, composing, music, with, acoustic, noise, to, evoke, the, sound, of, machinery, they, predicted, expansions, in, timbre, allowed, for, by, electronics, in, the, influential, manifesto, the, art, of, noises, 1913, developments, of, the, vacuum, tube, led, to, electronic, instruments, that, were, smaller, amplified, and, more, practical, for, performance, in, particular, the, theremin, ondes, martenot, and, trautonium, were, commercially, produced, by, the, early, 1930s, from, the, late, 1920s, the, increased, practicality, of, electronic, instruments, influenced, composers, such, as, joseph, schillinger, and, maria, schuppel, to, adopt, them, they, were, typically, used, within, orchestras, and, most, composers, wrote, parts, for, the, theremin, that, could, otherwise, be, performed, with, string, instruments, avant, garde, composers, criticized, the, predominant, use, of, electronic, instruments, for, conventional, purposes, the, instruments, offered, expansions, in, pitch, resources, that, were, exploited, by, advocates, of, microtonal, music, such, as, charles, ives, dimitrios, levidis, olivier, messiaen, and, edgard, var, se, further, percy, grainger, used, the, theremin, to, abandon, fixed, tonation, entirely, while, russian, composers, such, as, gavriil, popov, treated, it, as, a, source, of, noise, in, otherwise, acoustic, noise, music, developments, in, early, recording, technology, paralleled, that, of, electro, nic, instruments, the, first, means, of, recording, and, reproducing, audi, o, was, invented, in, the, late, 19th, century, m, with, the, mechanical, push, vmon, ograph, record, players, became, a, common, househokld, item, and, by, the, 1920s, composers, were, using, them, to, pl, ay, short, recordings, in, performances, the, introduction, of, electrical, recording, in, 1925, was, followed, by, increased, experimentation, with, record, players, paul, hindemith, and, ernst, toch, composed, several, pieces, in, 1930, by, layering, recordings, of, instruments, and, vocals, at, adjusted, speeds, influenced, by, these, techniques, john, cage, composed, imaginary, landscape, no, 1, in, 1939, by, adjusting, the, speeds, of, recorded, tones, composers, began, to, experiment, with, newly, developed, sound, on, film, technology, recordings, could, be, spliced, together, to, create, sound, collages, such, as, those, by, tristan, tzara, kurt, schwitters, filippo, tommaso, marinetti, walter, ruttmann, and, dziga, vertov, further, the, technology, allowed, sound, to, be, graphically, created, and, modified, these, techniques, were, used, to, compose, soundtracks, for, several, films, in, germany, and, russia, in, addition, to, the, popular, dr, jekyll, and, mr, hyde, in, the, united, states, experiments, with, graphical, sound, were, continued, by, norman, mclaren, from, the, late, 1930s, the, first, practical, audio, tape, recorder, was, unveiled, in, 1935, improvements, to, the, technology, were, made, using, the, ac, biasing, technique, which, significantly, improved, recording, fidelity, as, early, as, 1942, test, recordings, were, being, made, in, stereo, although, these, developments, were, initially, confined, to, germany, recorders, and, tapes, were, brought, to, the, united, states, following, the, end, of, world, war, ii, these, were, the, basis, for, the, first, commercially, produced, tape, recorder, in, 1948, in, 1944, before, the, use, of, magnetic, tape, for, compositional, purposes, egyptian, composer, halim, el, dabh, while, still, a, student, in, cairo, used, a, cumbersome, wire, recorder, to, record, sounds, of, an, ancient, zaar, ceremony, using, facilities, at, the, middle, east, radio, studios, el, dabh, processed, the, recorded, material, using, reverberation, echo, voltage, controls, and, re, recording, what, resulted, is, believed, to, be, the, earliest, tape, music, composition, the, resulting, work, was, entitled, the, expression, of, zaar, and, it, was, presented, in, 1944, at, an, art, gallery, event, in, cairo, while, his, initial, experiments, in, tape, based, composition, were, not, widely, known, outside, of, egypt, at, the, time, el, dabh, is, also, known, for, his, later, work, in, electronic, music, at, the, columbia, princeton, electronic, music, center, in, the, late, 1950s, following, his, work, with, studio, d, essai, at, radiodiffusion, fran, aise, rdf, during, the, early, 1940s, pierre, schaeffer, is, credited, with, originating, the, theory, and, practice, of, musique, concr, te, in, the, late, 1940s, experiments, in, sound, based, composition, using, shellac, record, players, were, first, conducted, by, schaeffer, in, 1950, the, techniques, of, musique, concrete, were, expanded, when, magnetic, tape, machines, were, used, to, explore, sound, manipulation, practices, such, as, speed, variation, pitch, shift, and, tape, splicing, on, 5, october, 1948, rdf, broadcast, schaeffer, s, etude, aux, chemins, de, fer, this, was, the, first, movement, of, cinq, tudes, de, bruits, and, marked, the, beginning, of, studio, realizations, and, musique, concr, te, or, acousmatic, art, schaeffer, employed, a, disc, cutting, lathe, four, turntables, a, four, channel, mixer, filters, an, echo, chamber, and, a, mobile, recording, unit, not, long, after, this, pierre, henry, began, collaborating, with, schaeffer, a, partnership, that, would, have, profound, and, lasting, effects, on, the, direction, of, electronic, music, another, associate, of, schaeffer, edgard, var, se, began, work, on, d, serts, a, work, for, chamber, orchestra, and, tape, the, tape, parts, were, created, at, pierre, schaeffer, s, studio, and, were, later, revised, at, columbia, university, in, 1950, schaeffer, gave, the, first, public, non, broadcast, concert, of, musique, concr, te, at, the, cole, normale, de, musique, de, paris, schaeffer, used, a, pa, system, several, turntables, and, mixers, the, performance, did, not, go, well, as, creating, live, montages, with, turntables, had, never, been, done, before, later, that, same, year, pierre, henry, collaborated, with, schaeffer, on, symphonie, pour, un, homme, seul, 1950, the, first, major, work, of, musique, concrete, in, paris, in, 1951, in, what, was, to, become, an, important, worldwide, trend, rtf, established, the, first, studio, for, the, production, of, electronic, music, also, in, 1951, schaeffer, and, henry, produced, an, opera, orpheus, for, concrete, sounds, and, voices, by, 1951, the, work, of, schaeffer, composer, percussionist, pierre, henry, and, sound, engineer, jacques, poullin, had, received, official, recognition, and, the, groupe, de, recherches, de, musique, concr, te, club, d, essai, de, la, radiodiffusion, t, l, vision, fran, aise, was, established, at, rtf, in, paris, the, ancestor, of, the, ortf, karlheinz, stockhausen, worked, briefly, in, schaeffer, s, studio, in, 1952, and, afterward, for, many, years, at, the, wdr, cologne, s, studio, for, electronic, music, 1954, saw, the, advent, of, what, would, now, be, considered, authentic, electric, plus, acoustic, compositions, acoustic, instrumentation, augmented, accompanied, by, recordings, of, manipulated, or, electronically, generated, sound, three, major, works, were, premiered, that, year, var, se, s, d, serts, for, chamber, ensemble, and, tape, sounds, and, two, works, by, otto, luening, and, vladimir, ussachevsky, rhapsodic, variations, for, the, louisville, symphony, and, a, poem, in, cycles, and, bells, both, for, orchestra, and, tape, because, he, had, been, working, at, schaeffer, s, studio, the, tape, part, for, var, se, s, work, contains, much, more, concrete, sounds, than, electronic, a, group, made, up, of, wind, instruments, percussion, and, piano, alternate, with, the, mutated, sounds, of, factory, noises, and, ship, sirens, and, motors, coming, from, two, loudspeakers, at, the, german, premiere, of, d, serts, in, hamburg, which, was, conducted, by, bruno, maderna, the, tape, controls, were, operated, by, karlheinz, stockhausen, the, title, d, serts, suggested, to, var, se, not, only, all, physical, deserts, of, sand, sea, snow, of, outer, space, of, empty, streets, but, also, the, deserts, in, the, mind, of, man, not, only, those, stripped, aspects, of, nature, that, suggest, bareness, aloofness, timelessness, but, also, that, remote, inner, space, no, telescope, can, reach, where, man, is, alone, a, world, of, mystery, and, essential, loneliness, in, cologne, what, would, become, the, most, famous, electronic, music, studio, in, the, world, was, officially, opened, at, the, radio, studios, of, the, nwdr, in, 1953, though, it, had, been, in, the, planning, stages, as, early, as, 1950, and, early, compositions, were, made, and, broadcast, in, 1951, the, brainchild, of, werner, meyer, eppler, robert, beyer, and, herbert, eimert, who, became, its, first, director, the, studio, was, soon, joined, by, karlheinz, stockhausen, and, gottfried, michael, koenig, in, his, 1949, thesis, elektronische, klangerzeugung, elektronische, musik, und, synthetische, sprache, meyer, eppler, conceived, the, idea, to, synthesize, music, entirely, from, electronically, produced, signals, in, this, way, elektronische, musik, was, sharply, differentiated, from, french, musique, concr, te, which, used, sounds, recorded, from, acoustical, sources, in, 1953, stockhausen, composed, his, studie, i, followed, in, 1954, by, elektronische, studie, ii, the, first, electronic, piece, to, be, published, as, a, score, in, 1955, more, experimental, and, electronic, studios, began, to, appear, notable, were, the, creation, of, the, studio, di, fonologia, musicale, di, radio, milano, a, studio, at, the, nhk, in, tokyo, founded, by, toshiro, mayuzumi, and, the, philips, studio, at, eindhoven, the, netherlands, which, moved, to, the, university, of, utrecht, as, the, institute, of, sonology, in, 1960, with, stockhausen, and, mauricio, kagel, in, residence, became, a, year, round, hive, of, charismatic, avant, gardism, on, two, occasions, combining, electronically, generated, sounds, with, relatively, conventional, orchestras, in, mixtur, 1964, and, hymnen, dritte, region, mit, orchester, 1967, stockhausen, stated, that, his, listeners, had, told, him, his, electronic, music, gave, them, an, experience, of, outer, space, sensations, of, flying, or, being, in, a, fantastic, dream, world, in, the, united, states, electronic, music, was, being, created, as, early, as, 1939, when, john, cage, published, imaginary, landscape, no, 1, using, two, variable, speed, turntables, frequency, recordings, muted, piano, and, cymbal, but, no, electronic, means, of, production, cage, composed, five, more, imaginary, landscapes, between, 1942, and, 1952, one, withdrawn, mostly, for, percussion, ensemble, though, no, 4, is, for, twelve, radios, and, no, 5, written, in, 1952, uses, 42, recordings, and, is, to, be, realized, as, a, magnetic, tape, according, to, otto, luening, cage, also, performed, williams, mix, at, donaueschingen, in, 1954, using, eight, loudspeakers, three, years, after, his, alleged, collaboration, williams, mix, was, a, success, at, the, donaueschingen, festival, where, it, made, a, strong, impression, the, music, for, magnetic, tape, project, was, formed, by, members, of, the, new, york, school, john, cage, earle, brown, christian, wolff, david, tudor, and, morton, feldman, and, lasted, three, years, until, 1954, cage, wrote, of, this, collaboration, in, this, social, darkness, therefore, the, work, of, earle, brown, morton, feldman, and, christian, wolff, continues, to, present, a, brilliant, light, for, the, reason, that, at, the, several, points, of, notation, performance, and, audition, action, is, provocative, cage, completed, williams, mix, in, 1953, while, working, with, the, music, for, magnetic, tape, project, the, group, had, no, permanent, facility, and, had, to, rely, on, borrowed, time, in, commercial, sound, studios, including, the, studio, of, bebe, and, louis, barron, in, the, same, year, columbia, university, purchased, its, first, tape, recorder, a, professional, ampex, machine, to, record, concerts, vladimir, ussachevsky, who, was, on, the, music, faculty, of, columbia, university, was, placed, in, charge, of, the, device, and, almost, immediately, began, experimenting, with, it, herbert, russcol, writes, soon, he, was, intrigued, with, the, new, sonorities, he, could, achieve, by, recording, musical, instruments, and, then, superimposing, them, on, one, another, ussachevsky, said, later, i, suddenly, realized, that, the, tape, recorder, could, be, treated, as, an, instrument, of, sound, transformation, on, thursday, 8, may, 1952, ussachevsky, presented, several, demonstrations, of, tape, music, effects, that, he, created, at, his, composers, forum, in, the, mcmillin, theatre, at, columbia, university, these, included, transposition, reverberation, experiment, composition, and, underwater, valse, in, an, interview, he, stated, i, presented, a, few, examples, of, my, discovery, in, a, public, concert, in, new, york, together, with, other, compositions, i, had, written, for, conventional, instruments, otto, luening, who, had, attended, this, concert, remarked, the, equipment, at, his, disposal, consisted, of, an, ampex, tape, recorder, and, a, simple, box, like, device, designed, by, the, brilliant, young, engineer, peter, mauzey, to, create, feedback, a, form, of, mechanical, reverberation, other, equipment, was, borrowed, or, purchased, with, personal, funds, just, three, months, later, in, august, 1952, ussachevsky, traveled, to, bennington, vermont, at, luening, s, invitation, to, present, his, experiments, there, the, two, collaborated, on, various, pieces, luening, described, the, event, equipped, with, earphones, and, a, flute, i, began, developing, my, first, tape, recorder, composition, both, of, us, were, fluent, improvisors, and, the, medium, fired, our, imaginations, they, played, some, early, pieces, informally, at, a, party, where, a, number, of, composers, almost, solemnly, congratulated, us, saying, this, is, it, it, meaning, the, music, of, the, future, word, quickly, reached, new, york, city, oliver, daniel, telephoned, and, invited, the, pair, to, produce, a, group, of, short, compositions, for, the, october, concert, sponsored, by, the, american, composers, alliance, and, broadcast, music, inc, under, the, direction, of, leopold, stokowski, at, the, museum, of, modern, art, in, new, york, after, some, hesitation, we, agreed, henry, cowell, placed, his, home, and, studio, in, woodstock, new, york, at, our, disposal, with, the, borrowed, equipment, in, the, back, of, ussachevsky, s, car, we, left, bennington, for, woodstock, and, stayed, two, weeks, in, late, september, 1952, the, travelling, laboratory, reached, ussachevsky, s, living, room, in, new, york, where, we, eventually, completed, the, compositions, two, months, later, on, 28, october, vladimir, ussachevsky, and, otto, luening, presented, the, first, tape, music, concert, in, the, united, states, the, concert, included, luening, s, fantasy, in, space, 1952, an, impressionistic, virtuoso, piece, using, manipulated, recordings, of, flute, and, low, speed, 1952, an, exotic, composition, that, took, the, flute, far, below, its, natural, range, both, pieces, were, created, at, the, home, of, henry, cowell, in, woodstock, new, york, after, several, concerts, caused, a, sensation, in, new, york, city, ussachevsky, and, luening, were, invited, onto, a, live, broadcast, of, nbc, s, today, show, to, do, an, interview, demonstration, the, first, televised, electroacoustic, performance, luening, described, the, event, i, improvised, some, sequences, for, the, tape, recorder, ussachevsky, then, and, there, put, them, through, electronic, transformations, the, score, for, forbidden, planet, by, louis, and, bebe, barron, was, entirely, composed, using, custom, built, electronic, circuits, and, tape, recorders, in, 1956, but, no, synthesizers, in, the, modern, sense, of, the, word, in, 1929, nikolai, obukhov, invented, the, sounding, cross, la, croix, sonore, comparable, to, the, principle, of, the, theremin, in, the, 1930s, nikolai, ananyev, invented, sonar, and, engineer, alexander, gurov, neoviolena, i, ilsarov, ilston, a, rimsky, korsakov, and, a, ivanov, emiriton, composer, and, inventor, arseny, avraamov, was, engaged, in, scientific, work, on, sound, synthesis, and, conducted, a, number, of, experiments, that, would, later, form, the, basis, of, soviet, electro, musical, instruments, in, 1956, vyacheslav, mescherin, created, the, ensemble, of, electro, musical, instruments, which, used, theremins, electric, harps, electric, organs, the, first, synthesizer, in, the, ussr, ekvodin, and, also, created, the, first, soviet, reverb, machine, the, style, in, which, meshcherin, s, ensemble, played, is, known, as, space, age, pop, in, 1957, engineer, igor, simonov, assembled, a, working, model, of, a, noise, recorder, electroeoliphone, with, the, help, of, which, it, was, possible, to, extract, various, timbres, and, consonances, of, a, noise, nature, in, 1958, evgeny, murzin, designed, ans, synthesizer, one, of, the, world, s, first, polyphonic, musical, synthesizers, founded, by, murzin, in, 1966, the, moscow, experimental, electronic, music, studio, became, the, base, for, a, new, generation, of, experimenters, eduard, artemyev, alexander, nemtin, s, ndor, kall, s, sofia, gubaidulina, alfred, schnittke, and, vladimir, martynov, by, the, end, of, the, 1960s, musical, groups, playing, light, electronic, music, appeared, in, the, ussr, at, the, state, level, this, music, began, to, be, used, to, attract, foreign, tourists, to, the, country, and, for, broadcasting, to, foreign, countries, in, the, mid, 1970s, composer, alexander, zatsepin, designed, an, orchestrolla, a, modification, of, the, mellotron, the, baltic, soviet, republics, also, had, their, own, pioneers, in, estonian, ssr, sven, grunberg, in, lithuanian, ssr, gedrus, kupriavicius, in, latvian, ssr, opus, and, zodiac, the, world, s, first, computer, to, play, music, was, csirac, which, was, designed, and, built, by, trevor, pearcey, and, maston, beard, mathematician, geoff, hill, programmed, the, csirac, to, play, popular, musical, melodies, from, the, very, early, 1950s, in, 1951, it, publicly, played, the, colonel, bogey, march, of, which, no, known, recordings, exist, only, the, accurate, reconstruction, however, csirac, played, standard, repertoire, and, was, not, used, to, extend, musical, thinking, or, composition, practice, csirac, was, never, recorded, but, the, music, played, was, accurately, reconstructed, the, oldest, known, recordings, of, computer, generated, music, were, played, by, the, ferranti, mark, 1, computer, a, commercial, version, of, the, baby, machine, from, the, university, of, manchester, in, the, autumn, of, 1951, the, music, program, was, written, by, christopher, strachey, the, earliest, group, of, electronic, musical, instruments, in, japan, yamaha, magna, organ, was, built, in, 1935, however, after, world, war, ii, japanese, composers, such, as, minao, shibata, knew, of, the, development, of, electronic, musical, instruments, by, the, late, 1940s, japanese, composers, began, experimenting, with, electronic, music, and, institutional, sponsorship, enabled, them, to, experiment, with, advanced, equipment, their, infusion, of, asian, music, into, the, emerging, genre, would, eventually, support, japan, s, popularity, in, the, development, of, music, technology, several, decades, later, following, the, foundation, of, electronics, company, sony, in, 1946, composers, toru, takemitsu, and, minao, shibata, independently, explored, possible, uses, for, electronic, technology, to, produce, music, takemitsu, had, ideas, similar, to, musique, concr, te, which, he, was, unaware, of, while, shibata, foresaw, the, development, of, synthesizers, and, predicted, a, drastic, change, in, music, sony, began, producing, popular, magnetic, tape, recorders, for, government, and, public, use, the, avant, garde, collective, jikken, k, b, experimental, workshop, founded, in, 1950, was, offered, access, to, emerging, audio, technology, by, sony, the, company, hired, toru, takemitsu, to, demonstrate, their, tape, recorders, with, compositions, and, performances, of, electronic, tape, music, the, first, electronic, tape, pieces, by, the, group, were, toraware, no, onna, imprisoned, woman, and, piece, b, composed, in, 1951, by, kuniharu, akiyama, many, of, the, electroacoustic, tape, pieces, they, produced, were, used, as, incidental, music, for, radio, film, and, theatre, they, also, held, concerts, employing, a, slide, show, synchronized, with, a, recorded, soundtrack, composers, outside, of, the, jikken, k, b, such, as, yasushi, akutagawa, saburo, tominaga, and, shir, fukai, were, also, experimenting, with, radiophonic, tape, music, between, 1952, and, 1953, musique, concr, te, was, introduced, to, japan, by, toshiro, mayuzumi, who, was, influenced, by, a, pierre, schaeffer, concert, from, 1952, he, composed, tape, music, pieces, for, a, comedy, film, a, radio, broadcast, and, a, radio, drama, however, schaeffer, s, concept, of, sound, object, was, not, influential, among, japanese, composers, who, were, mainly, interested, in, overcoming, the, restrictions, of, human, performance, this, led, to, several, japanese, electroacoustic, musicians, making, use, of, serialism, and, twelve, tone, techniques, evident, in, yoshir, irino, s, 1951, dodecaphonic, piece, concerto, da, camera, in, the, organization, of, electronic, sounds, in, mayuzumi, s, x, y, z, for, musique, concr, te, and, later, in, shibata, s, electronic, music, by, 1956, modelling, the,

music, studio, was, equipped, with, technologies, such, as, tone, generating, and, audio, processing, equipment, recording, and, radiophonic, equipment, ondes, martenot, monochord, and, melochord, sine, wave, oscillators, tape, recorders, ring, modulators, band, pass, filters, and, four, and, eight, channel, mixers, musicians, associated, with, the, studio, included, toshiro, mayuzumi, minao, shibata, joji, yuasa, toshi, ichiyanagi, and, toru, takemitsu, the, studio, s, first, electronic, compositions, were, completed, in, 1955, including, mayuzumi, s, five, minute, pieces, studie, i, music, for, sine, wave, by, proportion, of, prime, number, music, for, modulated, wave, by, proportion, of, prime, number, and, invention, for, square, wave, and, sawtooth, wave, produced, using, the, studio, s, various, tone, generating, capabilities, and, shibata, s, 20, minute, stereo, piece, musique, concr, te, for, stereophonic, broadcast, the, impact, of, computers, continued, in, 1956, lejaren, hiller, and, leonard, isaacson, composed, illiac, suite, for, string, quartet, the, first, complete, work, of, computer, assisted, composition, using, algorithmic, composition, hiller, postulated, that, a, computer, could, be, taught, the, rules, of, a, particular, style, and, then, called, on, to, compose, accordingly, later, developments, included, the, work, of, max, mathews, at, bell, laboratories, who, developed, the, influential, music, i, program, in, 1957, one, of, the, first, computer, programs, to, play, electronic, music, vocoder, technology, was, also, a, major, development, in, this, early, era, in, 1956, stockhausen, composed, gesang, der, j, nglinge, the, first, major, work, of, the, cologne, studio, based, on, a, text, from, the, book, of, daniel, an, important, technological, development, of, that, year, was, the, invention, of, the, clavivox, synthesizer, by, raymond, scott, with, subassembly, by, robert, moog, in, 1957, kid, baltan, dick, raaymakers, and, tom, dissevelt, released, their, debut, album, song, of, the, second, moon, recorded, at, the, philips, studio, in, the, netherlands, the, public, remained, interested, in, the, new, sounds, being, created, around, the, world, as, can, be, deduced, by, the, inclusion, of, var, se, s, po, me, lectronique, which, was, played, over, four, hundred, loudspeakers, at, the, philips, pavilion, of, the, 1958, brussels, world, fair, that, same, year, mauricio, kagel, an, argentine, composer, composed, transici, n, ii, the, work, was, realized, at, the, wdr, studio, in, cologne, two,

arel, and, mario, davidovsky, used, the, rca, synthesizer, extensively, in, various, compositions, one, of, the, most, influential, composers, associated, with, the, early, years, of, the, studio, was, egypt, s, halim, el, dabh, who, after, having, developed, the, earliest, known, electronic, tape, music, in, 1944, became, more, famous, for, leiyla, and, the, poet, a, 1959, series, of, electronic, compositions, that, stood, out, for, its, immersion, and, seamless, fusion, of, electronic, and, folk, music, in, contrast, to, the, more, mathematical, approach, used, by, serial, composers, of, the, time, such, as, babbitt, el, dabh, s, leiyla, and, the, poet, released, as, part, of, the, album, columbia, princeton, electronic, music, center, in, 1961, would, be, cited, as, a, strong, influence, by, a, number, of, musicians, ranging, from, neil, rolnick, charles, amirkhanian, and, alice, shields, to, rock, musicians, frank, zappa, and, the, west, coast, pop, art, experimental, band, following, the, emergence, of, differences, within, the, grmc, groupe, de, recherche, de, musique, concr, te, pierre, henry, philippe, arthuys, and, several, of, their, colleagues, resigned, in, april, 1958, schaeffer, created, a, new, collective, called, groupe, de, recherches, musicales, grm, and, set, about, recruiting, new, members, including, luc, ferrari, beatriz,

and, fran, ois, bayle, these, were, fertile, years, for, electronic, music, not, just, for, academia, but, for, independent, artists, as, synthesizer, technology, became, more, accessible, by, this, time, a, strong, community, of, composers, and, musicians, working, with, new, sounds, and, instruments, was, established, and, growing, 1960, witnessed, the, composition, of, luening, s, gargoyles, for, violin, and, tape, as, well, as, the, premiere, of, stockhausen, s, kontakte, for, electronic, sounds, piano, and, percussion, this, piece, existed, in, two, versions, one, for, 4, channel, tape, and, the, other, for, tape, with, human, performers, in, kontakte, stockhausen, abandoned, traditional, musical, form, based, on, linear, development, and, dramatic, climax, this, new, approach, which, he, termed, moment, form, resembles, the, cinematic, splice, techniques, in, early, twentieth, century, film, the, theremin, had, been, in, use, since, the, 1920s, but, it, attained, a, degree, of, popular, recognition, through, its, use, in, science, fiction, film, soundtrack, music, in, the, 1950s, e, g, bernard, herrmann, s, classic, score, for, the, day, the, earth, stood, still, in,

together, with, dr, shlomo, markel, in, cooperation, with, the, technion, israel, institute, of, technology, and, the, volkswagen, foundation, a, research, project, talmark, aimed, at, the, development, of, a, novel, musical, notation, system, for, electronic, music, milton, babbitt, composed, his, first, electronic, work, using, the, synthesizer, his, composition, for, synthesizer, 1961, which, he, created, using, the, rca, synthesizer, at, the, columbia, princeton, electronic, music, center, for, babbitt, the, rca, synthesizer, was, a, dream, come, true, for, three, reasons, first, the, ability, to, pinpoint, and, control, every, musical, element, precisely, second, the, time, needed, to, realize, his, elaborate, serial, structures, were, brought, within, practical, reach, third, the, question, was, no, longer, what, are, the, limits, of, the, human, performer, but, rather, what, are, the, limits, of, human, hearing, the, collaborations, also, occurred, across, oceans, and, continents, in, 1961, ussachevsky, invited, var, se, to, the, columbia, princeton, studio, cpemc, upon, arrival, varese, embarked, upon, a, revision, of, d, serts, he, was, assisted, by, mario, davidovsky, and, b, lent, arel, the, intense, activity, occurring, at, cpemc, and, elsewhere, inspired, the, establishment, of, the, san, francisco, tape, music, center, in, 1963, by, morton, subotnick, with, additional, members, pauline, oliveros, ramon, sender, anthony, martin, and, terry, riley, later, the, center, moved, to, mills, college, directed, by, pauline, oliveros, and, has,

in, the, early, sixties, grossi, was, a, cellist, and, composer, born, in, venice, in, 1917, he, founded, the, s, 2f, m, studio, de, fonologia, musicale, di, firenze, in, 1963, to, experiment, with, electronic, sound, and, composition, simultaneously, in, san, francisco, composer, stan, shaff, and, equipment, designer, doug, mceachern, presented, the, first, audium, concert, at, san, francisco, state, college, 1962, followed, by, work, at, the, san, francisco, museum, of, modern, art, 1963, conceived, of, as, in, time, controlled, movement, of, sound, in, space, twelve, speakers, surrounded,

alfred, frankenstein, commented, the, possibilities, of, the, space, sound, continuum, have, seldom, been, so, extensively, explored, in, 1967, the, first, audium, a, sound, space, continuum, opened, holding, weekly, performances, through, 1970, in, 1975, enabled, by, seed, money, from, the, national, endowment, for, the, arts, a, new, audium, opened, designed, floor, to, ceiling, for, spatial, sound, composition, and, performance, in, contrast, there, are, composers, who, manipulated, sound, space, by, locating, multiple, speakers, at, various, locations, in, a, performance, space, and, then, switching, or, panning, the, sound, between, the, sources, in, this, approach, the, composition, of, spatial, manipulation, is, dependent, on, the, location, of, the, speakers, and, usually, exploits, the, acoustical, properties, of, the, enclosure, examples, include, varese, s, poeme, electronique, tape, music, performed, in, the, philips, pavilion, of, the, 1958, world, fair, brussels,

synthesizer, developed, by, robert, moog, with, this, instrument, he, composed, some, works, with, gershon, kingsley, and, solo, a, well, known, example, of, the, use, of, moog, s, full, sized, moog, modular, synthesizer, is, the, 1968, switched, on, bach, album, by, wendy, carlos, which, triggered, a, craze, for, synthesizer, music, in, 1969, david, tudor, brought, a, moog, modular, synthesizer, and, ampex, tape, machines, to, the, national, institute, of, design, in, ahmedabad, with, the, support, of, the, sarabhai, family, forming, the, foundation, of, india, s, first, electronic, music,

melodies, were, first, generated, by, the, computer, csirac, in, australia, in, 1950, there, were, newspaper, reports, from, america, and, england, early, and, recently, that, computers, may, have, played, music, earlier, but, thorough, research, has, debunked, these, stories, as, there, is, no, evidence, to, support, the, newspaper, reports, some, of, which, were, obviously, speculative, research, has, shown, that, people, speculated, about, computers, playing, music, possibly, because, computers, would, make, noises, but, there, is, no, evidence, that, they, actually, did, it, the, world, s, first, computer, to, play, music, was, csirac, which, was, designed, and, built, by, trevor, pearcey, and, maston, beard, in, the, 1950s, mathematician, geoff, hill, programmed, the, csirac, to, play, popular, musical, melodies, from, the, very, early, 1950s, in, 1951, it, publicly, played, the, colonel, bogey, march, of, which, no, known, recordings, exist, however, csirac, played, standard, repertoire, and, was, not, used, to, extend, musical, thinking, or, composition, practice, which, is, current, computer, music, practice, the, first, music, to, be, performed, in, england, was, a, performance, of, the, british, national, anthem, that, was, programmed, by, christopher, strachey, on, the, ferranti, mark, i, late, in, 1951, later, that, year, short, extracts, of, three, pieces, were, recorded, there, by, a, bbc, outside, broadcasting, unit, the, national, anthem, ba, ba, black, sheep, and, in, the, mood, and, this, is, recognised, as, the, earliest, recording, of, a, computer, to, play, music, this, recording, can, be, heard, at, this, manchester, university, site, researchers, at, the, university, of, canterbury, christchurch, declicked, and, restored, this, recording, in, 2016, and, the, results, may, be, heard, on, soundcloud, the, late, 1950s, 1960s, and, 1970s, also, saw, the, development, of, large, mainframe, computer, synthesis, starting, in, 1957,

software, music, mouse, 1986, for, macintosh, amiga, and, atari, computers, an, important, new, development, was, the, advent, of, computers, to, compose, music, as, opposed, to, manipulating, or, creating, sounds, iannis, xenakis, began, what, is, called, musique, stochastique, or, stochastic, music, which, is, a, composing, method, that, uses, mathematical, probability, systems, different, probability, algorithms, were, used, to, create, a, piece, under, a, set, of, parameters, xenakis, used, computers, to, compose, pieces, like, st, 4, for, string, quartet, and, st, 48, for, orchestra,

dancers, favorite, section, the, turntable, eventually, went, on, to, become, the, most, visible, electronic, musical, instrument, and, occasionally, the, most, virtuosic, in, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, electronic, rock, was, also, produced, by, several, japanese, musicians, including, isao, tomita, s, electric, samurai, switched, on, rock, 1972, which, featured, moog, synthesizer, renditions, of, contemporary, pop, and, rock, songs, and, osamu, kitajima, s, progressive, rock, album, benzaiten, 1974, the, mid, 1970s, saw, the, rise, of, electronic, art, music, musicians, such, as, jean, michel, jarre, vangelis, tomita, and, klaus, schulze, who, were, significant, influences, on, the, development, of, new, age, music, the, hi, tech, appeal, of, these, works, created, for, some, years, the, trend, of, listing, the, electronic, musical, equipment, employed, in, the, album, sleeves, as, a, distinctive, feature, electronic, music, began, to, enter, regularly, in, radio, programming, and, top, sellers, charts, as, the, french, band, space, with, their, debut, studio, album, magic, fly, or, jarre, with, oxyg, ne, between, 1977, and, 1981, kraftwerk, released, albums, such, as, trans, europe, express, the, man, machine, or, computer, world, which, influenced, subgenres, of, electronic, music, in, this, era, the, sound, of, rock, musicians, like, mike, oldfield, and, the, alan, parsons, project, who, is, credited, the, first, rock, song, to, feature, a, digital, vocoder, in, 1975, the, raven, used, to, be, arranged, and, blended, with, electronic, effects, and, or, music, as, well, which, became, much, more, prominent, in, the, mid, 1980s, jeff, wayne, achieved, a, long, lasting, success, with, his, 1978, electronic, rock, musical, version, of, the, war, of, the, worlds, film, scores, also, benefit, from, the, electronic, sound, during, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, wendy, carlos, composed, the, score, for, a, clockwork, orange, the, shining, and, tron, in, 1977, gene, page, recorded, a, disco, version, of, the, hit, theme, by, john, williams, from, steven, spielberg, film, close, encounters, of, the, third, kind, page, s, version, peaked, on, the, r, b, chart, at, 30, the, score, of, 1978, film, midnight, express, composed, by, italian, synth, pioneer, giorgio, moroder, won, the, academy, award, for, best, original, score, in, 1979, as, did, it, again, in, 1981, the, score, by, vangelis, for, chariots, of, fire, after, the, arrival, of, punk, rock, a, form, of, basic, electronic, rock, emerged, increasingly, using, new, digital, technology, to, replace, other, instruments, the, american, duo, suicide, who, arose, from, the, punk, scene, in, new, york, utilized, drum, machines, and, synthesizers, in, a, hybrid, between, electronics, and, punk, on, their, eponymous, 1977, album, synth, pop, pioneering, bands, which, enjoyed, success, for, years, included, ultravox, with, their, 1977, track, hiroshima, mon, amour, on, ha, ha, ha, yellow, magic, orchestra, with, their, self, titled, album, 1978, the, buggles, with, their, prominent, 1979, debut, single, video, killed, the, radio, star, gary, numan, with, his, solo, debut, album, the, pleasure, principle, and, single, cars, in, 1979, orchestral, manoeuvres, in, the, dark, with, their, 1979, single, electricity, featured, on, their, eponymous, debut, album, depeche, mode, with, their, first, single, dreaming, of, me, recorded, in, 1980, and, released, in, 1981, album, speak, spell, a, flock, of, seagulls, with, their, 1981, single, talking, new, order, with, ceremony, in, 1981, and, the, human, league, with, their, 1981, hit, don, t, you, want, me, from, their, third, album, dare, the, definition, of, midi, and, the, development, of, digital, audio, made, the, development, of, purely, electronic, sounds, much, easier, with, audio, engineers, producers, and, composers, exploring, frequently, the, possibilities, of, virtually, every, new, model, of, electronic, sound, equipment, launched, by, manufacturers, synth, pop, sometimes, used, synthesizers, to, replace, all, other, instruments, but, it, was, more, common, that, bands, had, one, or, more, keyboardists, in, their, line, ups, along, with, guitarists, bassists, and, or, drummers, these, developments, led, to, the, growth, of, synth, pop, which, after, it, was, adopted, by, the, new, romantic, movement, allowed, synthesizers, to, dominate, the, pop, and, rock, music, of, the, early, 1980s, until, the, style, began, to, fall, from, popularity, in, the, mid, to, end, of, the, decade, along, with, the, aforementioned, successful, pioneers, key, acts, included, yazoo, duran, duran, spandau, ballet, culture, club, talk, talk, japan, and, eurythmics, synth, pop, was, taken, up, across, the, world, with, international, hits, for, acts, including, men, without, hats, trans, x, and, lime, from, canada, telex, from, belgium, peter, schilling, sandra, modern, talking, propaganda, and, alphaville, from, germany, yello, from, switzerland, and, azul, y, negro, from, spain, also, the, synth, sound, is, a, key, feature, of, italo, disco, some, synth, pop, bands, created, futuristic, visual, styles, of, themselves, to, reinforce, the, idea, of, electronic, sounds, were, linked, primarily, with, technology, as, americans, devo, and, spaniards, aviador, dro, keyboard, synthesizers, became, so, common, that, even, heavy, metal, rock, bands, a, genre, often, regarded, as, the, opposite, in, aesthetics, sound, and, lifestyle, from, that, of, electronic, pop, artists, by, fans, of, both, sides, achieved, worldwide, success, with, themes, as, 1983, jump, by, van, halen, and, 1986, the, final, countdown, by, europe, which, feature, synths, prominently, elektronmusikstudion, ems, formerly, known, as, electroacoustic, music, in, sweden, is, the, swedish, national, centre, for, electronic, music, and, sound, art, the, research, organisation, started, in, 1964, and, is, based, in, stockholm, steim, is, a, center, for, research, and, development, of, new, musical, instruments, in, the, electronic, performing, arts, located, in, amsterdam, netherlands, steim, has, existed, since, 1969, it, was, founded, by, misha, mengelberg, louis, andriessen, peter, schat, dick, raaymakers, jan, van, vlijmen, reinbert, de, leeuw, and, konrad, boehmer, this, group, of, dutch, composers, had, fought, for, the, reformation, of, amsterdam, s, feudal, music, structures, they, insisted, on, bruno, maderna, s, appointment, as, musical, director, of, the, concertgebouw, orchestra, and, enforced, the, first, public, fundings, for, experimental, and, improvised, electronic, music, in, the, netherlands, ircam, in, paris, became, a, major, center, for, computer, music, research, and, realization, and, development, of, the, sogitec, 4x, computer, system, featuring, then, revolutionary, real, time, digital, signal, processing, pierre, boulez, s, r, pons, 1981, for, 24, musicians, and, 6, soloists, used, the, 4x, to, transform, and, route, soloists, to, a, loudspeaker, system, barry, vercoe, describes, one, of, his, experiences, with, early, computer, sounds, at, ircam, in, paris, in, 1982, flutist, larry, beauregard, had, connected, his, flute, to, digiugno, s, 4x, audio, processor, enabling, real, time, pitch, following, on, a, guggenheim, at, the, time, i, extended, this, concept, to, real, time, score, following, with, automatic, synchronized, accompaniment, and, over, the, next, two, years, larry, and, i, gave, numerous, demonstrations, of, the, computer, as, a, chamber, musician, playing, handel, flute, sonatas, boulez, s, sonatine, for, flute, and, piano, and, by, 1984, my, own, synapse, ii, for, flute, and, computer, the, first, piece, ever, composed, expressly, for, such, a, setup, a, major, challenge, was, finding, the, right, software, constructs, to, support, highly, sensitive, and, responsive, accompaniment, all, of, this, was, pre, midi, but, the, results, were, impressive, even, though, heavy, doses, of, tempo, rubato, would, continually, surprise, my, synthetic, performer, in, 1985, we, solved, the, tempo, rubato, problem, by, incorporating, learning, from, rehearsals, each, time, you, played, this, way, the, machine, would, get, better, we, were, also, now, tracking, violin, since, our, brilliant, young, flautist, had, contracted, a, fatal, cancer, moreover, this, version, used, a, new, standard, called, midi, and, here, i, was, ably, assisted, by, former, student, miller, puckette, whose, initial, concepts, for, this, task, he, later, expanded, into, a, program, called, max, released, in, 1970, by, moog, music, the, mini, moog, was, among, the, first, widely, available, portable, and, relatively, affordable, synthesizers, it, became, once, the, most, widely, used, synthesizer, at, that, time, in, both, popular, and, electronic, art, music, patrick, gleeson, playing, live, with, herbie, hancock, at, the, beginning, of, the, 1970s, pioneered, the, use, of, synthesizers, in, a, touring, context, where, they, were, subject, to, stresses, the, early, machines, were, not, designed, for, in, 1974, the, wdr, studio, in, cologne, acquired, an, ems, synthi, 100, synthesizer, which, many, composers, used, to, produce, notable, electronic, works, including, rolf, gehlhaar, s, f, nf, deutsche, t, nze, 1975, karlheinz, stockhausen, s, sirius, 1975, 1976, and, john, mcguire, s, pulse, music, iii, 1978, thanks, to, miniaturization, of, electronics, in, the, 1970s, by, the, start, of, the, 1980s, keyboard, synthesizers, became, lighter, and, affordable, integrating, into, a, single, slim, unit, all, the, necessary, audio, synthesis, electronics, and, the, piano, style, keyboard, itself, in, sharp, contrast, with, the, bulky, machinery, and, cable, spaguetty, employed, along, with, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, first, with, analog, synthesizers, the, trend, followed, with, digital, synthesizers, and, samplers, as, well, see, below, in, 1975, the, japanese, company, yamaha, licensed, the, algorithms, for, frequency, modulation, synthesis, fm, synthesis, from, john, chowning, who, had, experimented, with, it, at, stanford, university, since, 1971, yamaha, s, engineers, began, adapting, chowning, s, algorithm, for, use, in, a, digital, synthesizer, adding, improvements, such, as, the, key, scaling, method, to, avoid, the, introduction, of, distortion, that, normally, occurred, in, analog, systems, during, frequency, modulation, in, 1980, yamaha, eventually, released, the, first, fm, digital, synthesizer, the, yamaha, gs, 1, but, at, an, expensive, price, in, 1983, yamaha, introduced, the, first, stand, alone, digital, synthesizer, the, dx7, which, also, used, fm, synthesis, and, would, become, one, of, the, best, selling, synthesizers, of, all, time, the, dx7, was, known, for, its, recognizable, bright, tonalities, that, was, partly, due, to, an, overachieving, sampling, rate, of, 57, khz, the, korg, poly, 800, is, a, synthesizer, released, by, korg, in, 1983, its, initial, list, price, of, 795, made, it, the, first, fully, programmable, synthesizer, that, sold, for, less, than, 1000, it, had, 8, voice, polyphony, with, one, digitally, controlled, oscillator, dco, per, voice, the, casio, cz, 101, was, the, first, and, best, selling, phase, distortion, synthesizer, in, the, casio, cz, line, released, in, november, 1984, it, was, one, of, the, first, if, not, the, first, fully, programmable, polyphonic, synthesizers, that, was, available, for, under, 500, the, roland, d, 50, is, a, digital, synthesizer, produced, by, roland, and, released, in, april, 1987, its, features, include, subtractive, synthesis, on, board, effects, a, joystick, for, data, manipulation, and, an, analogue, synthesis, styled, layout, design, the, external, roland, pg, 1000, 1987, 1990, programmer, could, also, be, attached, to, the, d, 50, for, more, complex, manipulation, of, its, sounds, a, sampler, is, an, electronic, or, digital, musical, instrument, which, uses, sound, recordings, or, samples, of, real, instrument, sounds, e, g, a, piano, violin, or, trumpet, excerpts, from, recorded, songs, e, g, a, five, second, bass, guitar, riff, from, a, funk, song, or, found, sounds, e, g, sirens, and, ocean, waves, the, samples, are, loaded, or, recorded, by, the, user, or, by, a, manufacturer, these, sounds, are, then, played, back, using, the, sampler, program, itself, a, midi, keyboard, sequencer, or, another, triggering, device, e, g, electronic, drums, to, perform, or, compose, music, because, these, samples, are, usually, stored, in, digital, memory, the, information, can, be, quickly, accessed, a, single, sample, may, often, be, pitch, shifted, to, different, pitches, to, produce, musical, scales, and, chords, before, computer, memory, based, samplers, musicians, used, tape, replay, keyboards, which, store, recordings, on, analog, tape, when, a, key, is, pressed, the, tape, head, contacts, the, moving, tape, and, plays, a, sound, the, mellotron, was, the, most, notable, model, used, by, many, groups, in, the, late, 1960s, and, the, 1970s, but, such, systems, were, expensive, and, heavy, due, to, the, multiple, tape, mechanisms, involved, and, the, range, of, the, instrument, was, limited, to, three, octaves, at, the, most, to, change, sounds, a, new, set, of, tapes, had, to, be, installed, in, the, instrument, the, emergence, of, the, digital, sampler, made, sampling, far, more, practical, the, earliest, digital, sampling, was, done, on, the, ems, musys, system, developed, by, peter, grogono, software, david, cockerell, hardware, and, interfacing, and, peter, zinovieff, system, design, and, operation, at, their, london, putney, studio, c, 1969, the, first, commercially, available, sampling, synthesizer, was, the, computer, music, melodian, by, harry, mendell, 1976, first, released, in, 1977, 1978, the, synclavier, i, using, fm, synthesis, re, licensed, from, yamaha, and, sold, mostly, to, universities, proved, to, be, highly, influential, among, both, electronic, music, composers, and, music, producers, including, mike, thorne, an, early, adopter, from, the, commercial, world, due, to, its, versatility, its, cutting, edge, technology, and, distinctive, sounds, the, first, polyphonic, digital, sampling, synthesizer, was, the, australian, produced, fairlight, cmi, first, available, in, 1979, these, early, sampling, synthesizers, used, wavetable, sample, based, synthesis, in, 1980, a, group, of, musicians, and, music, merchants, met, to, standardize, an, interface, that, new, instruments, could, use, to, communicate, control, instructions, with, other, instruments, and, computers, this, standard, was, dubbed, musical, instrument, digital, interface, midi, and, resulted, from, a, collaboration, between, leading, manufacturers, initially, sequential, circuits, oberheim, roland, and, later, other, participants, that, included, yamaha, korg, and, kawai, a, paper, was, authored, by, dave, smith, of, sequential, circuits, and, proposed, to, the, audio, engineering, society, in, 1981, then, in, august, 1983, the, midi, specification, 1, 0, was, finalized, midi, technology, allows, a, single, keystroke, control, wheel, motion, pedal, movement, or, command, from, a, microcomputer, to, activate, every, device, in, the, studio, remotely, and, synchrony, with, each, device, responding, according, to, conditions, predetermined, by, the, composer, midi, instruments, and, software, made, powerful, control, of, sophisticated, instruments, easily, affordable, by, many, studios, and, individuals, acoustic, sounds, became, reintegrated, into, studios, via, sampling, and, sampled, rom, based, instruments, miller, puckette, developed, graphic, signal, processing, software, for, 4x, called, max, after, max, mathews, and, later, ported, it, to, macintosh, with, dave, zicarelli, extending, it, for, opcode, for, real, time, midi, control, bringing, algorithmic, composition, availability, to, most, composers, with, modest, computer, programming, background, the, early, 1980s, saw, the, rise, of, bass, synthesizers, the, most, influential, being, the, roland, tb, 303, a, bass, synthesizer, and, sequencer, released, in, late, 1981, that, later, became, a, fixture, in, electronic, dance, music, particularly, acid, house, one, of, the, first, to, use, it, was, charanjit, singh, in, 1982, though, it, would, not, be, popularized, until, phuture, s, acid, tracks, in, 1987, music, sequencers, began, being, used, around, the, mid, 20th, century, and, tomita, s, albums, in, mid, 1970s, being, later, examples, in, 1978, yellow, magic, orchestra, were, using, computer, based, technology, in, conjunction, with, a, synthesiser, to, produce, popular, music, making, their, early, use, of, the, microprocessor, based, roland, mc, 8, microcomposer, sequencer, drum, machines, also, known, as, rhythm, machines, also, began, being, used, around, the, late, 1950s, with, a, later, example, being, osamu, kitajima, s, progressive, rock, album, benzaiten, 1974, which, used, a, rhythm, machine, along, with, electronic, drums, and, a, synthesizer, in, 1977, ultravox, s, hiroshima, mon, amour, was, one, of, the, first, singles, to, use, the, metronome, like, percussion, of, a, roland, tr, 77, drum, machine, in, 1980, roland, corporation, released, the, tr, 808, one, of, the, first, and, most, popular, programmable, drum, machines, the, first, band, to, use, it, was, yellow, magic, orchestra, in, 1980, and, it, would, later, gain, widespread, popularity, with, the, release, of, marvin, gaye, s, sexual, healing, and, afrika, bambaataa, s, planet, rock, in, 1982, the, tr, 808, was, a, fundamental, tool, in, the, later, detroit, techno, scene, of, the, late, 1980s, and, was, the, drum, machine, of, choice, for, derrick, may, and, juan, atkins, the, characteristic, lo, fi, sound, of, chip, music, was, initially, the, result, of, early, computer, s, sound, chips, and, sound, cards, technical, limitations, however, the, sound, has, since, become, sought, after, in, its, own, right, common, cheap, popular, sound, chips, of, the, first, home, computers, of, the, 1980s, include, the, sid, of, the, commodore, 64, and, general, instrument, ay, series, and, clones, like, the, yamaha, ym2149, used, in, the, zx, spectrum, amstrad, cpc, msx, compatibles, and, atari, st, models, among, others, synth, pop, continued, into, the, late, 1980s, with, a, format, that, moved, closer, to, dance, music, including, the, work, of, acts, such, as, british, duos, pet, shop, boys, erasure, and, the, communards, achieving, success, along, much, of, the, 1990s, the, trend, has, continued, to, the, present, day, with, modern, nightclubs, worldwide, regularly, playing, electronic, dance, music, edm, today, electronic, dance, music, has, radio, stations, websites, and, publications, like, mixmag, dedicated, solely, to, the, genre, despite, the, industry, s, attempt, to, create, a, specific, edm, brand, the, initialism, remains, in, use, as, an, umbrella, term, for, multiple, genres, including, dance, pop, house, techno, electro, and, trance, as, well, as, their, respective, subgenres, moreover, the, genre, has, found, commercial, and, cultural, significance, in, the, united, states, and, north, america, thanks, to, the, wildly, popular, big, room, house, edm, sound, that, has, been, incorporated, into, the, u, s, pop, music, and, the, rise, of, large, scale, commercial, raves, such, as, electric, daisy, carnival, tomorrowland, and, ultra, music, festival, on, the, other, hand, a, broad, group, of, electronic, based, music, styles, intended, for, listening, rather, than, strictly, for, dancing, became, known, under, the, electronica, umbrella, which, was, also, a, music, scene, in, the, early, 1990s, in, the, united, kingdom, according, to, a, 1997, billboard, article, the, union, of, the, club, community, and, independent, labels, provided, the, experimental, and, trend, setting, environment, in, which, electronica, acts, developed, and, eventually, reached, the, mainstream, citing, american, labels, such, as, astralwerks, the, chemical, brothers, fatboy, slim, the, future, sound, of, london, fluke, moonshine, dj, keoki, sims, daft, punk, and, city, of, angels, the, crystal, method, for, popularizing, the, latest, version, of, electronic, music, the, category, indie, electronic, or, indietronica, has, been, used, to, refer, to, a, wave, of, groups, with, roots, in, independent, rock, who, embraced, electronic, elements, such, as, synthesizers, samplers, drum, machines, and, computer, programs, and, influences, such, as, early, electronic, composition, krautrock, synth, pop, and, dance, music, recordings, are, commonly, made, on, laptops, using, digital, audio, workstations, the, first, wave, of, indie, electronic, artists, began, in, the, 1990s, with, acts, such, as, stereolab, who, used, vintage, gear, and, disco, inferno, who, embraced, modern, sampling, technology, and, the, genre, expanded, in, the, 2000s, as, home, recording, and, software, synthesizers, came, into, common, use, other, acts, included, broadcast, lali, puna, m, m, the, postal, service, skeletons, and, school, of, seven, bells, independent, labels, associated, with, the, style, include, warp, morr, music, sub, pop, and, ghostly, international, as, computer, technology, has, become, more, accessible, and, music, software, has, advanced, interacting, with, music, production, technology, is, now, possible, using, means, that, bear, no, relationship, to, traditional, musical, performance, practices, for, instance, laptop, performance, laptronica, live, coding, and, algorave, in, general, the, term, live, pa, refers, to, any, live, performance, of, electronic, music, whether, with, laptops, synthesizers, or, other, devices, beginning, around, the, year, 2000, some, software, based, virtual, studio, environments, emerged, with, products, such, as, propellerhead, s, reason, and, ableton, live, finding, popular, appeal, such, tools, provide, viable, and, cost, effective, alternatives, to, typical, hardware, based, production, studios, and, thanks, to, advances, in, microprocessor, technology, it, is, now, possible, to, create, high, quality, music, using, little, more, than, a, single, laptop, computer, such, advances, have, democratized, music, creation, leading, to, a, massive, increase, in, the, amount, of, home, produced, electronic, music, available, to, the, general, public, via, the, internet, software, based, instruments, and, effect, units, so, called, plugins, can, be, incorporated, in, a, computer, based, studio, using, the, vst, platform, some, of, these, instruments, are, more, or, less, exact, replicas, of, existing, hardware, such, as, the, roland, d, 50, arp, odyssey, yamaha, dx7, or, korg, m1, circuit, bending, is, the, modification, of, battery, powered, toys, and, synthesizers, to, create, new, unintended, sound, effects, it, was, pioneered, by, reed, ghazala, in, the, 1960s, and, reed, coined, the, name, circuit, bending, in, 1992, following, the, circuit, bending, culture, musicians, also, began, to, build, their, own, modular, synthesizers, causing, a, renewed, interest, in, the, early, 1960s, designs, eurorack, became, a, popular, system
