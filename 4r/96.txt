undertakes, a, quest, yet, it, is, the, emphasis, on, heterosexual, love, and, courtly, manners, distinguishes, it, from, the, chanson, de, geste, and, other, kinds, of, epic, which, involve, heroism,

from, the, early, 13th, century, for, example, the, romance, of, flamenca, the, prose, lancelot, or, vulgate, cycle, also, includes, passages, from, that, period, this, collection, indirectly, led, to, thomas, malory, s, le, morte, d, arthur, of, the, early, 1470s, prose, became, increasingly, attractive, because, it, enabled, writers, to, associate, popular, stories, with, serious, histories,

modern, image, of, the, medieval, is, more, influenced, by, the, romance, than, by, any, other, medieval, genre, and, the, word, medieval, evokes, knights, distressed, damsels, dragons, and, such, tropes, the, term, novel, originates, from, the, production, of, short, stories, or, novella, that, remained, part, of, a, european, oral, culture, of, storytelling, into, the, late, 19th, century, fairy, tales, jokes, and, humorous, stories, designed, to, make, a, point, in, a, conversation, and, the, exemplum, a, priest, would, insert, in, a, sermon, belong, into, this, tradition, written, collections, of, such, stories, circulated, in, a, wide, range, of, products, from, practical, compilations, of, examples, designed, for, the, use, of, clerics, to, compilations, of, various, stories, such, as, boccaccio, s, decameron, 1354, and, geoffrey, chaucer, s, canterbury, tales, 1386, 1400, the, decameron, was, a, compilation, of, one, hundred, novelle, told, by, ten, people, seven, women, and, three, men, fleeing, the, black, death, by, escaping, from, florence, to, the, fiesole, hills, in, 1348, the, modern, distinction, between, history, and, fiction, did, not, exist, in, the, early, sixteenth, century, and, the, grossest, improbabilities, pervade, many, historical, accounts, found, in, the, early, modern, print, market, william, caxton, s, 1485, edition, of, thomas, malory, s, le, morte, d, arthur, 1471, was, sold, as, a, true, history, though, the, story, unfolded, in, a, series, of, magical, incidents, and, historical, improbabilities, sir, john, mandeville, s, voyages, written, in, the, 14th, century, but, circulated, in, printed, editions, throughout, the, 18th, century, was, filled, with, natural, wonders, which, were, accepted, as, fact, like, the, one, footed, ethiopians, who, use, their, extremity, as, an, umbrella, against, the, desert, sun, both, works, eventually, came, to, be, viewed, as, works, of, fiction, in, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, two, factors, led, to, the, separation, of, history, and, fiction, the, invention, of, printing, immediately, created, a, new, market, of, comparatively, cheap, entertainment, and, knowledge, in, the, form, of, chapbooks, the, more, elegant, production, of, this, genre, by, 17th, and, 18th, century, authors, were, belles, lettres, that, is, a, market, that, would, be, neither, low, nor, academic, the, second, major, development, was, the, first, best, seller, of, modern, fiction, the, spanish, amadis, de, gaula, by, garc, a, montalvo, however, it, was, not, accepted, as, an, example, of, belles, lettres, the, amadis, eventually, became, the, archetypical, romance, in, contrast, with, the, modern, novel, which, began, to, be, developed, in, the, 17th, century, many, different, genres, of, literature, made, their, debut, during, the, edo, period, in, japan, helped, by, a, rising, literacy, rate, among, the, growing, population, of, townspeople, as, well, as, the, development, of, lending, libraries, ihara, saikaku, 1642, 1693, might, be, said, to, have, given, birth, to, the, modern, consciousness, of, the, novel, in, japan, mixing, vernacular, dialogue, into, his, humorous, and, cautionary, tales, of, the, pleasure, quarters, the, so, called, ukiyoz, shi, floating, world, genre, ihara, s, life, of, an, amorous, man, is, considered, the, first, work, in, this, genre, although, ihara, s, works, were, not, regarded, as, high, literature, at, the, time, because, it, had, been, aimed, towards, and, popularized, by, the, ch, nin, merchant, classes, they, became, popular, and, were, key, to, the, development, and, spread, of, ukiyoz, shi, a, chapbook, is, an, early, type, of, popular, literature, printed, in, early, modern, europe, produced, cheaply,

woodcuts, which, sometimes, bore, no, relation, to, the, text, when, illustrations, were, included, in, chapbooks, they, were, considered, popular, prints, the, tradition, arose, in, the, 16th, century, as, soon, as, printed, books, became, affordable, and, rose, to, its, height, during, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, many, different, kinds, of, ephemera, and, popular, or, folk, literature, were, published, as, chapbooks, such, as, almanacs, children, s, literature, folk, tales, nursery, rhymes, pamphlets, poetry, and, political, and, religious, tracts, the, term, chapbook, for, this, type, of, literature, was, coined, in, the, 19th, century, the, corresponding, french, and, german, terms, are, biblioth, que, bleue, blue, book, and, volksbuch, respectively, the, principal, historical, subject, matter, of, chapbooks, was, abridgements, of, ancient, historians, popular, medieval, histories, of, knights, stories, of, comical, heroes, religious, legends, and,

adopted, the, form, of, modern, popular, history, in, fact, satirized, that, genre, s, stylistic, achievements, the, division, between, low, and, high, literature, became, especially, visible, with, books, that, appeared, on, both, the, popular, and, belles, lettres, markets, in, the, course, of, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, low, chapbooks, included, abridgments, of, books, such, as, don,

in, the, 17th, century, principally, in, france, the, beginnings, of, modern, fiction, in, france, took, a, pseudo, bucolic, form, and, the, celebrated, l, astr, e, 1610, of, honore, d, urfe, 1568, 1625, which, is, the, earliest, french, novel, is, properly, styled, a, pastoral, although, its, action, was, in, the, main, languid, and, sentimental, there, was, a, side, of, the, astree, which, encouraged, that, extravagant, love, of, glory, that, spirit, of, panache, which, was, now, rising, to, its, height, in, france, that, spirit, it, was, which, animated, marin, le, roy, de, gomberville, 1603, 1674, who, was, the, inventor, of, what, have, since, been, known, as, the, heroical, romances, in, these, there, was, experienced, a, violent, recrudescence, of, the, old, medieval, elements, of, romance, the, impossible, valour, devoted, to, a, pursuit, of, the, impossible, beauty, but, the, whole, clothed, in, the, language, and, feeling, and, atmosphere, of, the, age, in, which, the, books, were, written, in, order, to, give, point, to, the, chivalrous, actions, of, the, heroes, it, was, always, hinted, that, they, were, well, known, public, characters, of, the, day, in, a, romantic, disguise, stories, of, witty, cheats, were, an, integral, part, of, the, european, novella, with, its, tradition, of, fabliaux, significant, examples, include, till,

with, these, titles, focused, on, a, hero, and, his, life, the, adventures, led, to, satirical, encounters, with, the, real, world, with, the, hero, either, becoming, the, pitiable, victim, or, the, rogue, who, exploited, the, vices, of, those, he, met, a, second, tradition, of, satirical, romances, can, be, traced, back, to, heinrich, wittenwiler, s, ring, c, 1410, and, to, fran, ois, rabelais, gargantua, and, pantagruel, 1532, 1564, which, parodied, and, satirized, heroic, romances, and, did, this, mostly, by, dragging, them, into, the, low, realm, of, the, burlesque, don, quixote, modified, the, satire, of, romances, its, hero, lost, contact, with, reality, by, reading, too, many, romances, in, the, amadisian, tradition, other, important, works, of, the, tradition, are, paul,

separate, market, for, fiction, and, poetry, did, not, exist, until, the, late, seventeenth, century, all, books, were, sold, under, the, rubric, of, history, and, politicks, in, the, early, 18th, century, including, pamphlets, memoirs, travel, literature, political, analysis, serious, histories, romances, poetry, and, novels, that, fictional, histories, shared, the, same, space, with, academic, histories, and, modern, journalism, had, been, criticized, by, historians, since, the, end, of, the, middle, ages, fictions, were, lies, and, therefore, hardly, justifiable, at, all, the, climate, however, changed, in, the, 1670s, the, romance, format, of, the, quasi, historical, works, of, madame, d, aulnoy, c, sar, vichard, de, saint, r, al, gatien, de, courtilz, de, sandras, and, anne, marguerite, petit, du, noyer, allowed, the, publication, of, histories, that, dared, not, risk, an, unambiguous, assertion, of, their, truth, the, literary, market, place, of, the, late, 17th, and, early, 18th, century, employed, a, simple, pattern, of, options, whereby, fictions, could, reach, out, into, the, sphere, of, true, histories, this, permitted, its, authors, to, claim, they, had, published, fiction, not, truth, if, they, ever, faced, allegations, of, libel, prefaces, and, title, pages, of, seventeenth, and, early, eighteenth, century, fiction, acknowledged, this, pattern, histories, could, claim, to, be, romances, but, threaten, to, relate, true, events, as, in, the, roman, clef, other, works, could, conversely, claim, to, be, factual, histories, yet, earn, the, suspicion, that, they, were, wholly, invented, a, further, differentiation, was, made, between, private, and, public, history, daniel, defoe, s, robinson, crusoe, was, within, this, pattern, neither, a, romance, nor, a, novel, it, smelled, of, romance, yet, the, preface, stated, that, it, should, most, certainly, be, read, as, a, true, private, history, the, rise, of, the, modern, novel, as, an, alternative, to, the, chivalric, romance, began, with, the, publication, of, miguel, de, cervantes, novel, don, quixote, the, first, great, novel, of, world, literature, it, continued, with, scarron, s, roman, comique, the, first, part, of, which, appeared, in, 1651, whose, heroes, noted, the, rivalry, between, french, romances, and, the, new, spanish, genre, in, germany, an, early, example, of, the, novel, is, simplicius, simplicissimus, by, hans, jakob, christoffel, von, grimmelshausen, published, in, 1668, late, 17th, century, critics, looked, back, on, the, history, of, prose, fiction, proud, of, the, generic, shift, that, had, taken, place, leading, towards, the, modern, novel, novella, the, first, perfect, works, in, french, were, those, of, scarron, and, madame, de, la, fayette,

were, filled, with, the, intriguing, new, subject, matter, and, the, epistolary, novel, grew, from, this, and, led, to, the, first, full, blown, example, of, scandalous, fiction, in, aphra, behn, s, love, letters, between, a, nobleman, and, his, sister, 1684, 1685, 1687, before, the, rise, of, the, literary, novel, reading, novels, had, only, been, a, form, of, entertainment, however, one, of, the, earliest, english, novels, daniel, defoe, s, robinson, crusoe, 1719, has, elements, of, the, romance, unlike, these, novels, because, of, its, exotic, setting, and, story, of, survival, in, isolation, crusoe, lacks, almost, all, of, the, elements, found, in, these, new, novels, wit, a, fast, narration, evolving, around, a, group, of, young, fashionable, urban, heroes, along, with, their, intrigues, a, scandalous, moral, gallant, talk, to, be, imitated, and, a, brief, concise, plot, the, new, developments, did, however, lead, to, eliza, haywood, s, epic, length, novel, love, in, excess, 1719, 20, and, to, samuel, richardson, s, pamela, or, virtue, rewarded, 1741, some, literary, historians, date, the, beginning, of, the, english, novel, with, richardson, s, pamela, rather, than, crusoe, the, idea, of, the, rise, of, the, novel, in, the, 18th, century, is, especially, associated, with, ian, watt, s, influential, study, the, rise, of, the, novel, 1957, in, watt, s, conception, a, rise, in, fictional, realism, during, the, 18th, century, came, to, distinguish, the, novel, from, earlier, prose, narratives, the, rising, status, of, the, novel, in, eighteenth,

the, sun, 1602, however, the, actual, tradition, of, the, philosophical, novel, came, into, being, in, the, 1740s, with, new, editions, of, more, s, work, under, the, title, utopia, or, the, happy, republic, a, philosophical, romance, 1743, voltaire, wrote, in, this, genre, in, micromegas, a, comic, romance, which, is, a, biting, satire, on, philosophy, ignorance, and, the, self, conceit, of, mankind, 1752, english, 1753, his, zadig, 1747, and, candide, 1759, became, central, texts, of, the, french, enlightenment, and, of, the, modern, novel, an, example, of, the, experimental, novel, is, laurence, sterne, s, the, life, and, opinions, of, tristram, shandy, gentleman, 1759, 1767, with, its, rejection, of, continuous, narration, in, it, the, author, not, only, addresses, readers, in, his, preface, but, speaks, directly, to, them, in, his, fictional, narrative, in, addition, to, sterne, s, narrative, experiments, there, are, visual, experiments, such, as, a, marbled, page, a, black, page, to, express, sorrow, and, a, page, of, lines, to, show, the, plot, lines, of, the, book, the, novel, as, a, whole, focuses, on, the, problems, of, language, with, constant, regard, to, john, locke, s, theories, in, an, essay, concerning, human, understanding, the, rise, of, the, word, novel, at, the, cost, of, its, rival, the, romance, remained, a, spanish, and, english, phenomenon, and, though, readers, all, over, western, europe, had, welcomed, the, novel, la, or, short, history, as, an, alternative, in, the, second, half, of, the, 17th, century, only, the, english, and, the, spanish, had, openly, discredited, the, romance, but, the, change, of, taste, was, brief, and, f, nelon, s, telemachus, 1699, 1700, already, exploited, a, nostalgia, for, the, old, romances, with, their, heroism, and, professed, virtue, jane, barker, explicitly, advertised, her, exilius, as, a, new, romance, written, after, the, manner, of, telemachus, in, 1715, robinson, crusoe, spoke, of, his, own, story, as, a, romance, though, in, the, preface, to, the, third, volume, published, in, 1720, defoe, attacks, all, who, said, that, the, story, is, feign, d, that, the, names, are, borrow, d, and, that, it, is, all, a, romance, that, there, never, were, any, such, man, or, place, the, late, 18th, century, brought, an, answer, with, the, romantic, movement, s, readiness, to, reclaim, the, word, romance, with, the, gothic, romance, and, the, historical, novels, of, walter, scott, robinson, crusoe, now, became, a, novel, in, this, period, that, is, a, work, of, the, new, realistic, fiction, created, in, the, 18th, century, sentimental, novels, relied, on, emotional, responses, and, feature, scenes, of, distress, and, tenderness, and, the, plot, is, arranged, to, advance, emotions, rather, than, action, the, result, is, a, valorization, of, fine, feeling, displaying, the, characters, as, models, of, refined, sensitive, emotional, affect, the, ability, to, display, such, feelings, was, thought, at, this, time, to, show, character, and, experience, and, to, help, shape, positive, social, life, and, relationships, an, example, of, this, genre, is, samuel, richardson, s, pamela, or, virtue, rewarded, 1740, composed, to, cultivate, the, principles, of, virtue, and, religion, in, the, minds, of, the, youth, of, both, sexes, which, focuses, on, a, potential, victim, a, heroine, that, has, all, the, modern, virtues, and, who, is, vulnerable, because, her, low, social, status, and, her, occupation, as, servant, of, a, libertine, who, falls, in, love, with, her, she, however, ends, in, reforming, her, antagonist, male, heroes, adopted, the, new, sentimental, character, traits, in, the, 1760s, laurence, sterne, s, yorick, the, hero, of, the, sentimental, journey, 1768, did, so, with, an, enormous, amount, of, humour, oliver, goldsmith, s, vicar, of, wakefield, 1766, and, henry, mackenzie, s, man, of, feeling, 1771, produced, the, far, more, serious, role, models, these, works, inspired, a, sub, and, counterculture, of, pornographic, novels, for, which, greek, and, latin, authors, in, translations, had, provided, elegant, models, from, the, last, century, pornography, includes, john, cleland, s, fanny, hill, 1748, which, offered, an, almost, exact, reversal, of, the, plot, of, novels, that, emphasise, virtue, the, prostitute, fanny, hill, learns, to, enjoy, her, work, and, establishes, herself, as, a, free, and, economically, independent, individual, in, editions, one, could, only, expect, to, buy, under, the, counter, less, virtuous, protagonists, can, also, be, found, in, satirical, novels, like, richard, head, s, english, rogue, 1665, that, feature, brothels, while, women, authors, like, aphra, behn, had, offered, their, heroines, alternative, careers, as, precursors, of, the, 19th, century, femmes, fatales, the, genre, evolves, in, the, 1770s, with, for, example, werther, in, johann, wolfgang, von, goethe, s, the, sorrows, of, young, werther, 1774, realising, that, it, is, impossible, for, him, to, integrate, into, the, new, conformist, society, and, pierre, choderlos, de, laclos, in, les, liaisons, dangereuses, 1782, showing, a, group, of, aristocrats, playing, games, of, intrigue, and, amorality, by, around, 1700, fiction, was, no, longer, a, predominantly, aristocratic, entertainment, and, printed, books, had, soon, gained, the, power, to, reach, readers, of, almost, all, classes, though, the, reading, habits, differed, and, to, follow, fashions, remained, a, privilege, spain, was, a, trendsetter, into, the, 1630s, but, french, authors, superseded, cervantes, de, quevedo, and, alem, n, in, the, 1640s, as, huet, was, to, note, in, 1670, the, change, was, one, of, manners, the, new, french, works, taught, a, new, on, the, surface, freer, gallant, exchange, between, the, sexes, as, the, essence, of, life, at, the, french, court, the, situation, changed, again, from, 1660s, into, the, 1690s, when, works, by, french, authors, were, published, in, holland, out, of, the, reach, of, french, censors, dutch, publishing, houses, pirated, fashionable, books, from, france, and, created, a, new, market, of, political, and, scandalous, fiction, this, led, to, a, market, of, european, rather, than, french, fashions, in, the, early, 18th, century, by, the, 1680s, fashionable, political, european, novels, had, inspired, a, second, wave, of, private, scandalous, publications, and, generated, new, productions, of, local, importance, women, authors, reported, on, politics, and, on, their, private, love, affairs, in, the, hague, and, in, london, german, students, imitated, them, to, boast, of, their, private, amours, in, fiction, the, london, the, anonymous, international, market, of, the, netherlands, publishers, in, hamburg, and, leipzig, generated, new, public, spheres, once, private, individuals, such, as, students, in, university, towns, and, daughters, of, london, s, upper, class, began, to, write, novels, based, on, questionable, reputations, the, public, began, to, call, for, a, reformation, of, manners, an, important, development, in, britain, at, the, beginning, of, the, century, was, that, new, journals, like, the, spectator, and, the, tatler, reviewed, novels, in, germany, gotthold, ephraim, lessing, s, briefe, die, neuste, literatur, betreffend, 1758, appeared, in, the, middle, of, the, century, with, reviews, of, art, and, fiction, by, the, 1780s, such, reviews, played, had, an, important, role, in, introducing, new, works, of, fiction, to, the, public, influenced, by, the, new, journals, reform, became, the, main, goal, of, the, second, generation, of, eighteenth, century, novelists, the, spectator, number, 10, had, stated, that, the, aim, was, now, to, enliven, morality, with, wit, and, to, temper, wit, with, morality, to, bring, philosophy, out, of, the, closets, and, libraries, schools, and, colleges, to, dwell, in, clubs, and, assemblies, at, tea, tables, and, coffeehouses, constructive, criticism, of, novels, had, until, then, been, rare, the, first, treatise, on, the, history, of, the, novel, was, a, preface, to, marie, de, la, fayette, s, novel, zayde, 1670, a, much, later, development, was, the, introduction, of, novels, into, school, and, later, university, curricula, the, french, churchman, and, scholar, pierre, daniel, huet, s, traitt, de, l, origine, des, romans, 1670, laid, the, ground, for, a, greater, acceptance, of, the, novel, as, literature, that, is, comparable, to, the, classics, in, the, early, 18th, century, the, theologian, had, not, only, dared, to, praise, fictions, but, he, had, also, explained, techniques, of, theological, interpretation, of, fiction, which, was, a, novelty, furthermore, readers, of, novels, and, romances, could, gain, insight, not, only, into, their, own, culture, but, also, that, of, distant, exotic, countries, when, the, decades, around, 1700, saw, the, appearance, of, new, editions, of, the, classical, authors, petronius, lucian, and, heliodorus, of, emesa, the, publishers, equipped, them, with, prefaces, that, referred, to, huet, s, treatise, and, the, canon, it, had, established, also, exotic, works, of, middle, eastern, fiction, entered, the, market, that, gave, insight, into, islamic, culture, the, book, of, one, thousand, and, one, nights, was, first, published, in, europe, from, 1704, to, 1715, in, french, and, then, translated, immediately, into, english, and, german, and, was, seen, as, a, contribution, to, huet, s, history, of, romances, the, english, select, collection, of, novels, in, six, volumes, 1720, 22, is, a, milestone, in, this, development, of, the, novel, s, prestige, it, included, huet, s, treatise, along, with, the, european, tradition, of, the, modern, novel, of, the, day, that, is, novella, from, machiavelli, s, to, marie, de, la, fayette, s, masterpieces, aphra, behn, s, novels, had, appeared, in, the, 1680s, but, became, classics, when, reprinted, in, collections, f, nelon, s, telemachus, 1699, 1700, became, a, classic, three, years, after, its, publication, new, authors, entering, the, market, were, now, ready, to, use, their, personal, names, rather, than, pseudonyms, including, eliza, haywood, who, in, 1719, following, in, the, footsteps, of, aphra, behn, used, her, name, with, unprecedented, pride, the, very, word, romanticism, is, connected, to, the, idea, of, romance, and, the, romance, genre, experienced, a, revival, at, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, with, gothic, fiction, that, began, in, 1764, with, horace, walpole, s, the, castle, of, otranto, subtitled, in, its, second, edition, a, gothic, story, subsequent, important, gothic, works, are, ann, radcliffe, s, the, mysteries, of, udolpho, 1794, and, monk, lewis, s, the, monk, 1795, the, new, romances, challenged, the, idea, that, the, novel, involved, a, realistic, depiction, of, life, and, destabilized, the, difference, the, critics, had, been, trying, to, establish, between, serious, classical, art, and, popular, fiction, gothic, romances, exploited, the, grotesque, and, some, critics, thought, that, their, subject, matter, deserved, less, credit, than, the, worst, medieval, tales, of, arthurian, knighthood, the, authors, of, this, new, type, of, fiction, were, accused, of, exploiting, all, available, topics, to, thrill, arouse, or, horrify, their, audience, these, new, romantic, novelists, however, claimed, that, they, were, exploring, the, entire, realm, of, fictionality, and, psychological, interpreters, in, the, early, 19th, century, read, these, works, as, encounters, with, the, deeper, hidden, truth, of, the, human, imagination, this, included, sexuality, anxieties, and, insatiable, desires, under, such, readings, novels, were, described, as, exploring, deeper, human, motives, and, it, was, suggested, that, such, artistic, freedom, would, reveal, what, had, not, previously, been, openly, visible, the, romances, of, de, sade, les, 120, journ, es, de, sodome, 1785, poe, s, tales, of, the, grotesque, and, arabesque, 1840, mary, shelley, frankenstein, 1818, and, e, t, a, hoffmann, die, elixiere, des, teufels, 1815, would, later, attract, 20th, century, psychoanalysts, and, supply, the, images, for, 20th, and, 21st, century, horror, films, love, romances, fantasy, novels, role, playing, computer, games, and, the, surrealists, the, historical, romance, was, also, important, at, this, time, but, while, earlier, writers, of, these, romances, paid, little, attention, to, historical, reality, walter, scott, s, historical, novel, waverley, 1814, broke, with, this, tradition, and, he, invented, the, true, historical, novel, at, the, same, time, he, was, influenced, by, gothic, romance, and, had, collaborated, in, 1801, with, monk, lewis, on, tales, of, wonder, with, his, waverley, novels, scott, hoped, to, do, for, the, scottish, border, what, goethe, and, other, german, poets, had, done, for, the, middle, ages, and, make, its, past, live, again, in, modern, romance, scott, s, novels, are, in, the, mode, he, himself, defined, as, romance, the, interest, of, which, turns, upon, marvelous, and, uncommon, incidents, he, used, his, imagination, to, re, evaluate, history, by, rendering, things, incidents, and, protagonists, in, the, way, only, the, novelist, could, do, his, work, remained, historical, fiction, yet, it, questioned, existing, historical, perceptions, the, use, of, historical, research, was, an, important, tool, scott, the, novelist, resorted, to, documentary, sources, as, any, historian, would, have, done, but, as, a, romantic, he, gave, his, subject, a, deeper, imaginative, and, emotional, significance, by, combining, research, with, marvelous, and, uncommon, incidents, scott, attracted, a, far, wider, market, than, any, historian, could, and, was, the, most, famous, novelist, of, his, generation, throughout, europe, in, the, 19th, century, the, relationship, between, authors, publishers, and, readers, changed, authors, originally, had, only, received, payment, for, their, manuscript, however, changes, in, copyright, laws, which, began, in, 18th, and, continued, into, the, 19th, century, promised, royalties, on, all, future, editions, another, change, in, the, 19th, century, was, that, novelists, began, to, read, their, works, in, theaters, halls, and, bookshops, also, during, the, nineteenth, century, the, market, for, popular, fiction, grew, and, competed, with, works, of, literature, new, institutions, like, the, circulating, library, created, a, new, market, with, a, mass, reading, public, another, difference, was, that, novels, began, to, deal, with, more, difficult, subjects, including, current, political, and, social, issues, that, were, being, discussed, in, newspapers, and, magazines, under, the, influence, of, social, critics, like, thomas, carlyle, the, idea, of, social, responsibility, became, a, key, subject, whether, of, the, citizen, or, of, the, artist, with, the, theoretical, debate, concentrating, on, questions, around, the, moral, soundness, of, the, modern, novel, questions, about, artistic, integrity, as, well, as, aesthetics, including, the, idea, of, art, for, art, s, sake, proposed, by, writers, like, oscar, wilde, and, algernon, charles, swinburne, were, also, important, major, british, writers, such, as, charles, dickens, and, thomas, hardy, were, influenced, by, the, romance, genre, tradition, of, the, novel, which, had, been, revitalized, during, the, romantic, period, the, bront, sisters, were, notable, mid, 19th, century, authors, in, this, tradition, with, anne, bront, s, the, tenant, of, wildfell, hall, charlotte, bront, s, jane, eyre, and, emily, bront, s, wuthering, heights, publishing, at, the, very, end, of, the, 19th, century, joseph, conrad, has, been, called, a, supreme, romancer, in, america, the, romance, proved, to, be, a, serious, flexible, and, successful, medium, for, the, exploration, of, philosophical, ideas, and, attitudes, notable, examples, include, nathaniel, hawthorne, s, the, scarlet, letter, and, herman, melville, s, moby, dick, a, number, of, european, novelists, were, similarly, influenced, during, this, period, by, the, earlier, romance, tradition, along, with, the, romanticism, including, victor, hugo, with, novels, like, the, hunchback, of, notre, dame, 1831, and, les, mis, rables, 1862, and, mikhail, yuryevich, lermontov, with, a, hero, of, our, time, 1840, many, 19th, century, authors, dealt, with, significant, social, matters, mile, zola, s, novels, depicted, the, world, of, the, working, classes, which, marx, and, engels, s, non, fiction, explores, in, the, united, states, slavery, and, racism, became, topics, of, far, broader, public, debate, thanks, to, harriet, beecher, stowe, s, uncle, tom, s, cabin, 1852, which, dramatizes, topics, that, had, previously, been, discussed, mainly, in, the, abstract, charles, dickens, novels, led, his, readers, into, contemporary, workhouses, and, provided, first, hand, accounts, of, child, labor, the, treatment, of, the, subject, of, war, changed, with, leo, tolstoy, s, war, and, peace, 1868, 69, where, he, questions, the, facts, provided, by, historians, similarly, the, treatment, of, crime, is, very, different, in, fyodor, dostoyevsky, s, crime, and, punishment, 1866, where, the, point, of, view, is, that, of, a, criminal, women, authors, had, dominated, fiction, from, the, 1640s, into, the, early, 18th, century, but, few, before, george, eliot, so, openly, questioned, the, role, education, and, status, of, women, in, society, as, she, did, as, the, novel, became, a, platform, of, modern, debate, national, literatures, were, developed, that, link, the, present, with, the, past, in, the, form, of, the, historical, novel, alessandro, manzoni, s, i, promessi, sposi, 1827, did, this, for, italy, while, novelists, in, russia, and, the, surrounding, slavonic, countries, as, well, as, scandinavia, did, likewise, along, with, this, new, appreciation, of, history, the, future, also, became, a, topic, for, fiction, this, had, been, done, earlier, in, works, like, samuel, madden, s, memoirs, of, the, twentieth, century, 1733, and, mary, shelley, s, the, last, man, 1826, a, work, whose, plot, culminated, in, the, catastrophic, last, days, of, a, mankind, extinguished, by, the, plague, edward, bellamy, s, looking, backward, 1887, and, h, g, wells, s, the, time, machine, 1895, were, concerned, with, technological, and, biological, developments, industrialization, darwin, s, theory, of, evolution, and, marx, s, theory, of, class, divisions, shaped, these, works, and, turned, historical, processes, into, a, subject, of, wide, debate, bellamy, s, looking, backward, became, the, second, best, selling, book, of, the, 19th, century, after, harriet, beecher, stowe, s, uncle, tom, s, cabin, such, works, led, to, the, development, of, a, whole, genre, of, popular, science, fiction, as, the, 20th, century, approached, james, joyce, s, ulysses, 1922, had, a, major, influence, on, modern, novelists, in, the, way, that, it, replaced, the, 18th, and, 19th, century, narrator, with, a, text, that, attempted, to, record, inner, thoughts, or, a, stream, of, consciousness, this, term, was, first, used, by, william, james, in, 1890, and, along, with, the, related, term, interior, monologue, is, used, by, modernists, like, dorothy, richardson, marcel, proust, virginia, woolf, and, william, faulkner, also, in, the, 1920s, expressionist, alfred, d, blin, went, in, a, different, direction, with, berlin, alexanderplatz, 1929, where, interspersed, non, fictional, text, fragments, exist, alongside, the, fictional, material, to, create, another, new, form, of, realism, which, differs, from, that, of, stream, of, consciousness, later, works, like, samuel, beckett, s, trilogy, molloy, 1951, malone, dies, 1951, and, the, unnamable, 1953, as, well, as, julio, cort, zar, s, rayuela, 1963, and, thomas, pynchon, s, gravity, s, rainbow, 1973, all, make, use, of, the, stream, of, consciousness, technique, on, the, other, hand, robert, coover, is, an, example, of, those, authors, who, in, the, 1960s, fragmented, their, stories, and, challenged,

the, mystical, works, of, hermann, hesse, such, as, steppenwolf, 1927, and, produced, iconic, works, of, its, own, for, example, ken, kesey, s, one, flew, over, the, cuckoo, s, nest, and, thomas,
