first, stage, of, a, project, to, generate, ideas, with, technical, understanding, and, creative, flair, for, the, design, organization, and, use, of, spaces, the, landscape, architect, can, conceive, the, overall, concept, and, prepare, the, master, plan, from, which, detailed, design, drawings, and, technical, specifications, are, prepared, they, can, also, review, proposals, to, authorize, and,

adoption, of, the, term, landscape, architecture, by, the, modern, profession, he, took, up, the, term, from, meason, and, gave, it, publicity, in, his, encyclopedias, and, in, his, 1840, book, on, the, landscape, gardening, and, landscape, architecture, of, the, late, humphry, repton, john, claudius, loudon, was, an, established, and, influential, horticultural, journalist, and, scottish,

of, the, late, humphry, repton, loudon, describes, two, distinct, styles, of, landscape, gardening, existing, at, the, beginning, of, the, 19th, century, geometric, and, natural, loudon, wrote, that, each, style, reflected, a, different, stage, of, society, the, geometric, style, was, most, striking, and, pleasing, displaying, wealth, and, taste, in, an, early, state, of, society, and, in, countries, where, the, general, scenery, was, wild, irregular, and, natural, and, man, comparatively, uncultivated, and, unrefined, the, natural, style, was, used, in, modern, times, and, in, countries, where, society, is, in, a, higher, state, of, cultivation, displaying, wealth, and, taste, through, the, sacrifice, of, profitable, lands, to, make, room, for, such, designs, the, prominent, english, landscape, designer, humphry, repton, 1752, 1818, echoed, similar, ideas, in, his, work, and, design, ideas, in, his, writings, on, the, use, of, delineated, spaces, e, g, courtyards, terrace, walls, fences, repton, states, that, while, the, motive, for, defense, no, longer, exists, the, features, are, still, useful, in, separating, the, gardens, which, belong, to, man, and, the, forest, or, desert, which, belongs, to, the, wild, denizens, repton, refers, to, indigenous, peoples, as, uncivilized, human, beings, against, whom, some, decided, line, of, defense, was, absolutely, necessary, the, practice, of, landscape, architecture, spread, from, the, old, to, the, new, world, the, term, landscape, architect, was, used, as, a, professional, title, by, frederick,
