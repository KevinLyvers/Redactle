fields, with, the, intention, of, creating, an, economy, and, culture, comparable, peter, s, example, set, a, precedent, for, the, remainder, of, the, 18th, century, as, russian, writers, began, to, form, clear, ideas, about, the, proper, use, and, progression, of, the, russian, language, through, their, debates, regarding, versification, of, the, russian, language, and, tone, of, russian, literature, the, writers, in, the, first, half, of, the, 18th, century, were, able, to, lay, foundation, for, the, more, poignant, topical, work, of, the, late, 18th, century, satirist, antiokh, dmitrievich, kantemir, 1708, 1744, was, one, of, the, earliest, russian, writers, not, only, to, praise, the, ideals, of, peter, i, s, reforms, but, the, ideals, of, the, growing, enlightenment, movement, in, europe, kantemir, s, works, regularly, expressed, his, admiration, for, peter, most, notably, in, his, epic, dedicated, to, the, emperor, entitled, petrida, more, often, however, kantemir, indirectly, praised, peter, s, influence, through, his, satiric, criticism, of, russia, s, superficiality, and, obscurantism, which, he, saw, as, manifestations, of, the, backwardness, peter, attempted, to, correct, through, his, reforms, kantemir, honored, this, tradition, of, reform, not, only, through, his, support, for, peter, but, by, initiating, a, decade, long, debate, on, the, proper, syllabic, versification, using, the, russian, language, vasily, kirillovich, trediakovsky, a, poet, playwright, essayist, translator, and, contemporary, to, antiokh, kantemir, also, found, himself, deeply, entrenched, in, enlightenment, conventions, in, his, work, with, the, russian, academy, of, sciences, and, his, groundbreaking, translations, of, french, and, classical, works, to, the, russian, language, a, turning, point, in, the, course, of, russian, literature, his, translation, of, paul, tallemant, s, work, voyage, to, the, isle, of, love, was, the, first, to, use, the, russian, vernacular, as, opposed, the, formal, and, outdated, church, slavonic, this, introduction, set, a, precedent, for, secular, works, to, be, composed, in, the, vernacular, while, sacred, texts, would, remain, in, church, slavonic, however, his, work, was, often, incredibly, theoretical, and, scholarly, focused, on, promoting, the, versification, of, the, language, with, which, he, spoke, while, trediakovsky, s, approach, to, writing, is, often, described, as, highly, erudite, the, young, writer, and, scholarly, rival, to, trediakovsky, alexander, petrovich, sumarokov, 1717, 1777, was, dedicated, to, the, styles, of, french, classicism, sumarokov, s, interest, in, the, form, of, the, 17th, century, french, literature, mirrored, his, devotion, to, the, westernizing, spirit, of, peter, the, great, s, age, although, he, often, disagreed, with, trediakovsky, sumarokov, also, advocated, the, use, of, simple, natural, language, in, order, to, diversify, the, audience, and, make, more, efficient, use, of, the, russian, language, like, his, colleagues, and, counterparts, sumarokov, extolled, the, legacy, of, peter, i, writing, in, his, manifesto, epistle, on, poetry, the, great, peter, hurls, his, thunder, from, the, baltic, shores, the, russian, sword, glitters, in, all, corners, of, the, universe, peter, the, great, s, policies, of, westernization, and, displays, of, military, prowess, naturally, attracted, sumarokov, and, his, contemporaries, mikhail, vasilyevich, lomonosov, in, particular, expressed, his, gratitude, for, and, dedication, to, peter, s, legacy, in, his, unfinished, peter, the, great, lomonosov, s, works, often, focused, on, themes, of, the, awe, inspiring, grandeur, nature, and, was, therefore, drawn, to, peter, because, of, the, magnitude, of, his, military, architectural, and, cultural, feats, in, contrast, to, sumarokov, s, devotion, to, simplicity, lomonosov, favored, a, belief, in, a, hierarchy, of, literary, styles, divided, into, high, middle, and, low, this, style, facilitated, lomonosov, s, grandiose, high, minded, writing, and, use, of, both, vernacular, and, church, slavonic, the, influence, of, peter, i, and, debates, over, the, function, and, form, of, literature, as, it, related, to, the, russian, language, in, the, first, half, of, the, 18th, century, set, a, stylistic, precedent, for, the, writers, during, the, reign, of, catherine, the, great, in, the, second, half, of, the, century, however, the, themes, and, scopes, of, the, works, these, writers, produced, were, often, more, poignant, political, and, controversial, ippolit, bogdanovich, s, narrative, poem, dushenka, 1778, is, rare, sample, of, the, rococo, style, erotic, light, poetry, in, russia, alexander, nikolayevich, radishchev, for, example, shocked, the, russian, public, with, his, depictions, of, the, socio, economic, condition, of, the, serfs, empress, catherine, ii, condemned, this, portrayal, forcing, radishchev, into, exile, in, siberia, others, however, picked, topics, less, offensive, to, the, autocrat, the, historian, and, writer, nikolay, karamzin, 1766, 1826, the, key, figure, of, literary, sentimentalism, in, russia, for, example, is, known, for, his, advocacy, of, russian, writers, adopting, traits, in, the, poetry, and, prose, like, a, heightened, sense, of, emotion, and, physical, vanity, considered, to, be, feminine, at, the, time, as, well, as, supporting, the, cause, of, female, russian, writers, karamzin, s, call, for, male, writers, to, write, with, femininity, was, not, in, accordance, with, the, enlightenment, ideals, of, reason, and, theory, considered, masculine, attributes, his, works, were, thus, not, universally, well, received, however, they, did, reflect, in, some, areas, of, society, a, growing, respect, for, or, at, least, ambivalence, toward, a, female, ruler, in, catherine, the, great, this, concept, heralded, an, era, of, regarding, female, characteristics, in, writing, as, an, abstract, concept, linked, with, attributes, of, frivolity, vanity, and, pathos, some, writers, on, the, other, hand, were, more, direct, in, their, praise, for, catherine, ii, gavrila, romanovich, derzhavin, famous, for, his, odes, often, dedicated, his, poems, to, empress, catherine, ii, in, contrast, to, most, of, his, contemporaries, derzhavin, was, highly, devoted, to, his, state, he, served, in, the, military, before, rising, to, various, roles, in, catherine, ii, s, government, including, secretary, to, the, empress, and, minister, of, justice, unlike, those, who, took, after, the, grand, style, of, mikhail, lomonosov, and, alexander, sumarokov, derzhavin, was, concerned, with, the, minute, details, of, his, subjects, denis, fonvizin, an, author, primarily, of, comedy, approached, the, subject, of, the, russian, nobility, with, an, angle, of, critique, fonvizin, felt, the, nobility, should, be, held, to, the, standards, they, were, under, the, reign, of, peter, the, great, during, which, the, quality, of, devotion, to, the, state, was, rewarded, his, works, criticized, the, current, system, for, rewarding, the, nobility, without, holding, them, responsible, for, the, duties, they, once, performed, using, satire, and, comedy, fonvizin, supported, a, system, of, nobility, in, which, the, elite, were, rewarded, based, upon, personal, merit, rather, than, the, hierarchal, favoritism, that, was, rampant, during, catherine, the, great, s, reign, i, lay, and, heard, the, voice, of, god, arise, oh, prophet, watch, and, hearken, and, with, my,
