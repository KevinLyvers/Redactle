modernism, was, an, early, 20th, century, movement, in, literature, visual, arts, and, music, that, emphasized, experimentation, abstraction, and, subjective, experience, philosophy, politics, architecture, and, social, issues, were, all, aspects, of, this, movement, modernism, centered, around, beliefs, in, a, growing, alienation, from, prevailing, morality, optimism, and, convention, and, a, desire, to, change, how, human, beings, in, a, society, interact, and, live, together, the, modernist, movement, emerged, during, the, late, 19th, century, in, response, to, significant, changes, in, western, culture, including, secularization, and, the, growing, influence, of, science, it, is, characterized, by, a, self, conscious, rejection, of, tradition, and, the, search, for, newer, means, of, cultural, expression, modernism, was, influenced, by, widespread, technological, innovation, industrialization, and, urbanization, as, well, as, the, cultural, and, geopolitical, shifts, that, occurred, after, world, war, i, artistic, movements, and, techniques, associated, with, modernism, include, abstract, art, literary, stream, of, consciousness, cinematic, montage, musical, atonality, and, twelve, tonality, modernist, architecture, and, urban, planning, modernism, took, a, critical, stance, towards, the, enlightenment, concept, of, rationalism, the, movement, also, rejected, the, concept, of, absolute, originality, the, idea, of, creation, from, nothingness, upheld, in, the, 19th, century, by, both, realism, and, romanticism, replacing, it, with, techniques, of, collage, reprise, incorporation, rewriting, recapitulation, revision, and, parody, another, feature, of, modernism, was, reflexivity, about, artistic, and, social, convention, which, led, to, experimentation, highlighting, how, works, of, art, are, made, as, well, as, the, material, from, which, they, are, created, debate, about, the, timeline, of, modernism, continues, with, some, scholars, arguing, that, it, evolved, into, late, modernism, or, high, modernism, postmodernism, meanwhile, rejects, many, of, the, principles, of, modernism, modernism, was, a, cultural, movement, that, impacted, the, arts, as, well, as, the, broader, zeitgeist, it, is, commonly, described, as, a, system, of, thought, and, behavior, marked, by, self, consciousness, or, self, reference, prevalent, within, the, avant, garde, of, various, arts, and, disciplines, it, is, also, often, perceived, especially, in, the, west, as, a, socially, progressive, movement, that, affirms, the, power, of, human, beings, to, create, improve, and, reshape, their, environment, with, the, aid, of, practical, experimentation, scientific, knowledge, or, technology, from, this, perspective, modernism, encourages, the, re, examination, of, every, aspect, of, existence, modernists, analyze, topics, to, find, the, ones, they, believe, to, be, holding, back, progress, replacing, them, with, new, ways, of, reaching, the, same, end, according, to, historian, roger, griffin, modernism, can, be, defined, as, a, broad, cultural, social, or, political, initiative, sustained, by, the, ethos, of, the, temporality, of, the, new, griffin, believed, that, modernism, aspired, to, restore, a, sense, of, sublime, order, and, purpose, to, the, contemporary, world, thereby, counteracting, the, perceived, erosion, of, an, overarching, nomos, or, sacred, canopy, under, the, fragmenting, and, secularizing, impact, of, modernity, therefore, phenomena, apparently, unrelated, to, each, other, such, as, expressionism, futurism, vitalism, theosophy, psychoanalysis, nudism, eugenics, utopian, town, planning, and, architecture, modern, dance, bolshevism, organic, nationalism, and, even, the, cult, of, self, sacrifice, that, sustained, the, hecatomb, of, the, first, world, war, disclose, a, common, cause, and, psychological, matrix, in, the, fight, against, perceived, decadence, all, of, them, embody, bids, to, access, a, supra, personal, experience, of, reality, in, which, individuals, believed, they, could, transcend, their, mortality, and, eventually, that, they, would, cease, to, be, victims, of, history, to, instead, become, its, creators, literary, modernism, is, often, summed, up, in, a, line, from, w, b, yeats, things, fall, apart, the, centre, cannot, hold, in, the, second, coming, modernists, often, search, for, a, metaphysical, centre, but, experience, its, collapse, postmodernism, by, way, of, contrast, celebrates, that, collapse, exposing, the, failure, of, metaphysics, such, as, jacques, derrida, s, deconstruction, of, metaphysical, claims, philosophically, the, collapse, of, metaphysics, can, be, traced, back, to, the, scottish, philosopher, david, hume, 1711, 1776, who, argued, that, we, never, actually, perceive, one, event, causing, another, we, only, experience, the, constant, conjunction, of, events, and, do, not, perceive, a, metaphysical, cause, similarly, hume, argued, that, we, never, know, the, self, as, object, only, the, self, as, subject, and, we, are, thus, blind, to, our, true, natures, moreover, if, we, only, know, through, sensory, experience, such, as, sight, touch, and, feeling, then, we, cannot, know, and, neither, can, we, make, metaphysical, claims, thus, modernism, can, be, driven, emotionally, by, the, desire, for, metaphysical, truths, while, understanding, their, impossibility, some, modernist, novels, for, instance, feature, characters, like, marlow, in, heart, of, darkness, or, nick, carraway, in, the, great, gatsby, who, believe, that, they, have, encountered, some, great, truth, about, nature, or, character, truths, that, the, novels, themselves, treat, ironically, while, offering, more, mundane, explanations, similarly, many, poems, of, wallace, stevens, convey, a, struggle, with, the, sense, of, nature, s, significance, falling, under, two, headings, poems, in, which, the, speaker, denies, that, nature, has, meaning, only, for, nature, to, loom, up, by, the, end, of, the, poem, and, poems, in, which, the, speaker, claims, nature, has, meaning, only, for, that, meaning, to, collapse, by, the, end, of, the, poem, modernism, often, rejects, nineteenth, century, realism, if, the, latter, is, understood, as, focusing, on, the, embodiment, of, meaning, within, a, naturalistic, representation, at, the, same, time, some, modernists, aim, at, a, more, real, realism, one, that, is, uncentered, picasso, s, proto, cubist, painting, les, demoiselles, d, avignon, of, 1907, see, picture, above, does, not, present, its, subjects, from, a, single, point, of, view, that, of, a, single, viewer, but, instead, presents, a, flat, two, dimensional, picture, plane, the, poet, of, 1911, is, similarly, decentred, presenting, the, body, from, multiple, points, of, view, as, the, peggy, guggenheim, collection, website, puts, it, picasso, presents, multiple, views, of, each, object, as, if, he, had, moved, around, it, and, synthesizes, them, into, a, single, compound, image, modernism, with, its, sense, that, things, fall, apart, can, be, seen, as, the, apotheosis, of, romanticism, if, romanticism, is, the, often, frustrated, quest, for, metaphysical, truths, about, character, nature, a, higher, power, and, meaning, in, the, world, modernism, often, yearns, for, a, romantic, or, metaphysical, centre, but, later, finds, its, collapse, this, distinction, between, modernism, and, romanticism, extends, to, their, respective, treatments, of, symbol, the, romantics, at, times, see, an, essential, relation, the, ground, between, the, symbol, or, the, vehicle, in, i, a, richards, s, terms, and, its, tenor, its, meaning, for, example, in, coleridge, s, description, of, nature, as, that, eternal, language, which, thy, god, utters, but, while, some, romantics, may, have, perceived, nature, and, its, symbols, as, god, s, language, for, other, romantic, theorists, it, remains, inscrutable, as, goethe, not, himself, a, romantic, said, the, idea, remains, eternally, and, infinitely, active, and, inaccessible, in, the, image, this, was, extended, in, modernist, theory, which, drawing, on, its, symbolist, precursors, often, emphasizes, the, inscrutability, and, failure, of, symbol, and, metaphor, for, example, wallace, stevens, seeks, and, fails, to, find, meaning, in, nature, even, if, he, at, times, seems, to, sense, such, a, meaning, as, such, symbolists, and, modernists, at, times, adopt, a, mystical, approach, to, suggest, a, non, rational, sense, of, meaning, for, these, reasons, modernist, metaphors, may, be, unnatural, as, for, instance, in, t, s, eliot, s, description, of, an, evening, spread, out, against, the, sky, like, a, patient, etherized, upon, a, table, similarly, for, many, later, modernist, poets, nature, is, unnaturalized, and, at, times, mechanized, as, for, example, in, stephen, oliver, s, image, of, the, moon, busily, hoisting, itself, into, consciousness, modernism, developed, out, of, romanticism, s, revolt, against, the, effects, of, the, industrial, revolution, and, bourgeois, values, literary, scholar, gerald, graff, argues, that, the, ground, motive, of, modernism, was, criticism, of, the, 19th, century, bourgeois, social, order, and, its, world, view, the, modernists, carrying, the, torch, of, romanticism, while, j, m, w, turner, 1775, 1851, one, of, the, most, notable, landscape, painters, of, the, 19th, century, was, a, member, of, the, romantic, movement, his, pioneering, work, in, the, study, of, light, color, and, atmosphere, anticipated, the, french, impressionists, and, therefore, modernism, in, breaking, down, conventional, formulas, of, representation, though, unlike, them, he, believed, that, his, works, should, always, express, significant, historical, mythological, literary, or, other, narrative, themes, however, the, modernists, were, critical, of, the, romantics, belief, that, art, serves, as, a, window, into, the, nature, of, reality, they, argued, that, since, each, viewer, interprets, art, through, their, own, subjective, perspective, it, can, never, convey, the, ultimate, metaphysical, truth, that, the, romantics, sought, nonetheless, the, modernists, did, not, completely, reject, the, idea, of, art, as, a, means, of, understanding, the, world, to, them, it, was, a, tool, for, challenging, and, disrupting, the, viewer, s, point, of, view, rather, than, as, a, direct, means, of, accessing, a, higher, reality, modernism, often, rejects, 19th, century, realism, when, the, latter, is, understood, as, focusing, on, the, embodiment, of, meaning, within, a, naturalistic, representation, instead, some, modernists, aim, at, a, more, real, realism, one, that, is, uncentered, for, instance, picasso, s, 1907, proto, cubist, painting, les, demoiselles, d, avignon, does, not, present, its, subjects, from, a, single, point, of, view, instead, presenting, a, flat, two, dimensional, picture, plane, the, poet, of, 1911, is, similarly, decentered, presenting, the, body, from, multiple, points, of, view, as, the, peggy, guggenheim, collection, comments, picasso, presents, multiple, views, of, each, object, as, if, he, had, moved, around, it, and, synthesizes, them, into, a, single, compound, image, modernism, with, its, sense, that, things, fall, apart, is, often, seen, as, the, apotheosis, of, romanticism, as, august, wilhelm, schlegel, an, early, german, romantic, described, it, while, romanticism, searches, for, metaphysical, truths, about, character, nature, higher, power, and, meaning, in, the, world, modernism, although, yearning, for, such, a, metaphysical, center, only, finds, its, collapse, in, the, context, of, the, industrial, revolution, 1760, 1840, influential, innovations, included, steam, powered, industrialization, especially, the, development, of, railways, starting, in, britain, in, the, 1830s, and, the, subsequent, advancements, in, physics, engineering, and, architecture, they, led, to, a, major, 19th, century, engineering, achievement, was, the, crystal, palace, the, huge, cast, iron, and, plate, glass, exhibition, hall, built, for, the, great, exhibition, of, 1851, in, london, glass, and, iron, were, used, in, a, similar, monumental, style, in, the, construction, of, major, railway, terminals, throughout, the, city, including, king, s, cross, station, 1852, and, paddington, station, 1854, these, technological, advances, spread, abroad, leading, to, later, structures, such, as, the, brooklyn, bridge, 1883, and, the, eiffel, tower, 1889, the, latter, of, which, broke, all, previous, limitations, on, how, tall, man, made, objects, could, be, while, such, engineering, feats, radically, altered, the, 19th, century, urban, environment, and, the, daily, lives, of, people, the, human, experience, of, time, itself, was, altered, with, the, development, of, the, electric, telegraph, in, 1837, as, well, as, the, adoption, of, standard, time, by, british, railway, companies, from, 1845, a, concept, which, would, be, adopted, throughout, the, rest, of, the, world, over, the, next, fifty, years, despite, continuing, technological, advances, the, ideas, that, history, and, civilization, were, inherently, progressive, and, that, such, advances, were, always, good, came, under, increasing, attack, in, the, 19th, century, arguments, arose, that, the, values, of, the, artist, and, those, of, society, were, not, merely, different, but, in, fact, oftentimes, opposed, and, that, society, s, current, values, were, antithetical, to, further, progress, therefore, civilization, could, not, move, forward, in, its, present, form, early, in, the, century, the, philosopher, schopenhauer, 1788, 1860, the, world, as, will, and, representation, 1819, 20, called, into, question, previous, optimism, his, ideas, had, an, important, influence, on, later, thinkers, including, friedrich, nietzsche, 1844, 1900, similarly, s, ren, kierkegaard, 1813, 1855, and, nietzsche, 120, both, later, rejected, the, idea, that, reality, could, be, understood, through, a, purely, objective, lens, a, rejection, that, had, a, significant, influence, on, the, development, of, existentialism, and, nihilism, around, 1850, the, pre, raphaelite, brotherhood, a, group, of, english, poets, painters, and, art, critics, began, to, challenge, the, dominant, trends, of, industrial, victorian, england, in, opposition, to, technical, skill, without, inspiration, 815, they, were, influenced, by, the, writings, of, the, art, critic, john, ruskin, 1819, 1900, who, had, strong, feelings, about, the, role, of, art, in, helping, to, improve, the, lives, of, the, urban, working, classes, in, the, rapidly, expanding, industrial, cities, of, britain, 816, art, critic, clement, greenberg, described, the, pre, raphaelite, brotherhood, as, proto, modernists, there, the, proto, modernists, were, of, all, people, the, pre, raphaelites, and, even, before, them, as, proto, proto, modernists, the, german, nazarenes, the, pre, raphaelites, foreshadowed, manet, 1832, 1883, with, whom, modernist, painting, most, definitely, begins, they, acted, on, a, dissatisfaction, with, painting, as, practiced, in, their, time, holding, that, its, realism, wasn, t, truthful, enough, two, of, the, most, significant, thinkers, of, the, mid, 19th, century, were, biologist, charles, darwin, 1809, 1882, author, of, on, the, origin, of, species, through, natural, selection, 1859, and, political, scientist, karl, marx, 1818, 1883, author, of, das, kapital, 1867, despite, coming, from, different, fields, both, of, their, theories, threatened, the, established, order, darwin, s, theory, of, evolution, by, natural, selection, undermined, religious, certainty, and, the, idea, of, human, uniqueness, in, particular, the, notion, that, human, beings, are, driven, by, the, same, impulses, as, lower, animals, proved, to, be, difficult, to, reconcile, with, the, idea, of, an, ennobling, spirituality, meanwhile, marx, s, arguments, that, there, are, fundamental, contradictions, within, the, capitalist, system, and, that, workers, are, anything, but, free, led, to, the, formulation, of, marxist, theory, art, historians, have, suggested, various, dates, as, starting, points, for, modernism, historian, william, everdell, argued, that, modernism, began, in, the, 1870s, when, metaphorical, or, ontological, continuity, began, to, yield, to, the, discrete, with, mathematician, richard, dedekind, s, 1831, 1916, dedekind, cut, and, ludwig, boltzmann, s, 1844, 1906, statistical, thermodynamics, everdell, also, believed, modernism, in, painting, began, in, 1885, 1886, with, post, impressionist, artist, georges, seurat, s, development, of, divisionism, the, dots, used, to, paint, a, sunday, afternoon, on, the, island, of, la, grande, jatte, on, the, other, hand, visual, art, critic, clement, greenberg, called, german, philosopher, immanuel, kant, 1724, 1804, the, first, real, modernist, although, he, also, wrote, what, can, be, safely, called, modernism, emerged, in, the, middle, of, the, last, century, and, rather, locally, in, france, with, charles, baudelaire, 1821, 1867, in, literature, and, manet, in, painting, and, perhaps, with, gustave, flaubert, 1821, 1880, too, in, prose, fiction, it, was, a, while, later, and, not, so, locally, that, modernism, appeared, in, music, and, architecture, the, poet, baudelaire, s, les, fleurs, du, mal, the, flowers, of, evil, and, the, author, flaubert, s, madame, bovary, were, both, published, in, 1857, baudelaire, s, essay, the, painter, of, modern, life, 1863, inspired, young, artists, to, break, away, from, tradition, and, innovate, new, ways, of, portraying, their, world, in, art, beginning, in, the, 1860s, two, approaches, in, the, arts, and, letters, developed, separately, in, france, the, first, was, impressionism, a, school, of, painting, that, initially, focused, on, work, done, not, in, studios, but, outdoors, en, plein, air, impressionist, paintings, attempted, to, convey, that, human, beings, do, not, see, objects, but, instead, see, light, itself, the, school, gathered, adherents, despite, internal, divisions, among, its, leading, practitioners, and, became, increasingly, influential, initially, rejected, from, the, most, important, commercial, show, of, the, time, the, government, sponsored, paris, salon, the, impressionists, organized, yearly, group, exhibitions, in, commercial, venues, during, the, 1870s, and, 1880s, timing, them, to, coincide, with, the, official, salon, in, 1863, the, salon, des, refus, s, created, by, emperor, napoleon, iii, displayed, all, of, the, paintings, rejected, by, the, paris, salon, while, most, were, in, standard, styles, but, by, inferior, artists, the, work, of, manet, attracted, attention, and, opened, commercial, doors, to, the, movement, the, second, french, school, was, symbolism, which, literary, historians, see, beginning, with, charles, baudelaire, and, including, the, later, poets, arthur, rimbaud, 1854, 1891, with, une, saison, en, enfer, a, season, in, hell, 1873, paul, verlaine, 1844, 1896, st, phane, mallarm, 1842, 1898, and, paul, val, ry, 1871, 1945, the, symbolists, stressed, the, priority, of, suggestion, and, evocation, over, direct, description, and, explicit, analogy, and, were, especially, interested, in, the, musical, properties, of, language, cabaret, which, gave, birth, to, so, many, of, the, arts, of, modernism, including, the, immediate, precursors, of, film, may, be, said, to, have, begun, in, france, in, 1881, with, the, opening, of, the, black, cat, in, montmartre, the, beginning, of, the, ironic, monologue, and, the, founding, of, the, society, of, incoherent, arts, the, theories, of, sigmund, freud, 1856, 1939, krafft, ebing, and, other, sexologists, were, influential, in, the, early, days, of, modernism, freud, s, first, major, work, was, studies, on, hysteria, with, josef, breuer, 1895, central, to, freud, s, thinking, is, the, idea, of, the, primacy, of, the, unconscious, mind, in, mental, life, so, that, all, subjective, reality, was, based, on, the, interactions, between, basic, drives, and, instincts, through, which, the, outside, world, was, perceived, freud, s, description, of, subjective, states, involved, an, unconscious, mind, full, of, primal, impulses, and, counterbalancing, self, imposed, restrictions, derived, from, social, values, 538, the, works, of, friedrich, nietzsche, 1844, 1900, were, another, major, precursor, of, modernism, with, a, philosophy, in, which, psychological, drives, specifically, the, will, to, power, wille, zur, macht, were, of, central, importance, nietzsche, often, identified, life, itself, with, will, to, power, that, is, with, an, instinct, for, growth, and, durability, henri, bergson, 1859, 1941, on, the, other, hand, emphasized, the, difference, between, scientific, clock, time, and, the, direct, subjective, human, experience, of, time, 131, his, work, on, time, and, consciousness, had, a, great, influence, on, 20th, century, novelists, especially, those, modernists, who, used, the, stream, of, consciousness, technique, such, as, dorothy, richardson, james, joyce, and, virginia, woolf, 1882, 1941, also, important, in, bergson, s, philosophy, was, the, idea, of, lan, vital, the, life, force, which, brings, about, the, creative, evolution, of, everything, 132, his, philosophy, also, placed, a, high, value, on, intuition, though, without, rejecting, the, importance, of, the, intellect, 132, important, literary, precursors, of, modernism, included, esteemed, writers, such, as, fyodor, dostoevsky, 1821, 1881, whose, novels, include, crime, and, punishment, 1866, and, the, brothers, karamazov, 1880, walt, whitman, 1819, 1892, who, published, the, poetry, collection, leaves, of, grass, 1855, 1891, and, august, strindberg, 1849, 1912, especially, his, later, plays, including, the, trilogy, to, damascus, 1898, 1901, a, dream, play, 1902, and, the, ghost, sonata, 1907, henry, james, has, also, been, suggested, as, a, significant, precursor, to, modernism, in, works, as, early, as, the, portrait, of, a, lady, 1881, out, of, the, collision, of, ideals, derived, from, romanticism, and, an, attempt, to, find, a, way, for, knowledge, to, explain, that, which, was, as, yet, unknown, came, the, first, wave, of, modernist, works, in, the, opening, decade, of, the, 20th, century, although, their, authors, considered, them, to, be, extensions, of, existing, trends, in, art, these, works, broke, the, implicit, understanding, the, general, public, had, of, art, that, artists, were, the, interpreters, and, representatives, of, bourgeois, culture, and, ideas, these, modernist, landmarks, include, the, atonal, ending, of, arnold, schoenberg, s, second, string, quartet, in, 1908, the, expressionist, paintings, of, wassily, kandinsky, starting, in, 1903, and, culminating, with, his, first, abstract, painting, and, the, founding, of, the, blue, rider, group, in, munich, in, 1911, and, the, rise, of, fauvism, and, the, inventions, of, cubism, from, the, studios, of, henri, matisse, pablo, picasso, georges, braque, and, others, in, the, years, between, 1900, and, 1910, an, important, aspect, of, modernism, is, how, it, relates, to, tradition, through, its, adoption, of, techniques, like, reprise, incorporation, rewriting, recapitulation, revision, and, parody, in, new, forms, t, s, eliot, made, significant, comments, on, the, relation, of, the, artist, to, tradition, including, e, shall, often, find, that, not, only, the, best, but, the, most, individual, parts, of, work, may, be, those, in, which, the, dead, poets, his, ancestors, assert, their, immortality, most, vigorously, however, the, relationship, of, modernism, with, tradition, was, complex, as, literary, scholar, peter, child, s, indicates, there, were, paradoxical, if, not, opposed, trends, towards, revolutionary, and, reactionary, positions, fear, of, the, new, and, delight, at, the, disappearance, of, the, old, nihilism, and, fanatical, enthusiasm, creativity, and, despair, an, example, of, how, modernist, art, can, apply, older, traditions, while, also, incorporating, new, techniques, can, be, found, within, the, music, of, the, composer, arnold, schoenberg, on, the, one, hand, he, rejected, traditional, tonal, harmony, the, hierarchical, system, of, organizing, works, of, music, that, had, guided, musical, composition, for, at, least, a, century, and, a, half, schoenberg, believed, he, had, discovered, a, wholly, new, way, of, organizing, sound, based, on, the, use, of, twelve, note, rows, yet, while, this, was, indeed, a, wholly, new, technique, its, origins, can, be, traced, back, to, the, work, of, earlier, composers, such, as, franz, liszt, richard, wagner, gustav, mahler, richard, strauss, and, max, reger, in, the, world, of, art, in, the, first, decade, of, the, 20th, century, young, painters, such, as, pablo, picasso, and, henri, matisse, caused, much, controversy, and, attracted, great, criticism, with, their, rejection, of, traditional, perspective, as, the, means, of, structuring, paintings, though, the, impressionist, claude, monet, had, already, been, innovative, in, his, use, of, perspective, in, 1907, as, picasso, was, painting, les, demoiselles, d, avignon, oskar, kokoschka, was, writing, m, rder, hoffnung, der, frauen, murderer, hope, of, women, the, first, expressionist, play, produced, with, scandal, in, 1909, and, arnold, schoenberg, was, composing, his, string, quartet, no, 2, in, f, sharp, minor, 1908, his, first, composition, without, a, tonal, center, a, primary, influence, that, led, to, cubism, was, the, representation, of, three, dimensional, form, in, the, late, works, of, paul, c, zanne, which, were, displayed, in, a, retrospective, at, the, 1907, salon, d, automne, in, cubist, artwork, objects, are, analyzed, broken, up, and, reassembled, in, an, abstract, form, instead, of, depicting, objects, from, one, viewpoint, the, artist, depicts, the, subject, from, a, multitude, of, viewpoints, to, represent, the, subject, in, a, greater, context, cubism, was, brought, to, the, attention, of, the, general, public, for, the, first, time, in, 1911, at, the, salon, des, ind, pendants, in, paris, held, 21, april, 13, june, jean, metzinger, albert, gleizes, henri, le, fauconnier, robert, delaunay, fernand, l, ger, and, roger, de, la, fresnaye, were, shown, together, in, room, 41, provoking, a, scandal, out, of, which, cubism, emerged, and, spread, throughout, paris, and, beyond, also, in, 1911, kandinsky, painted, bild, mit, kreis, picture, with, a, circle, which, he, later, called, the, first, abstract, painting, 167, in, 1912, metzinger, and, gleizes, wrote, the, first, and, only, major, cubist, manifesto, du, cubisme, published, in, time, for, the, salon, de, la, section, d, or, the, largest, cubist, exhibition, to, date, in, 1912, metzinger, painted, and, exhibited, his, enchanting, la, femme, au, cheval, woman, with, a, horse, and, danseuse, au, caf, dancer, in, a, caf, albert, gleizes, painted, and, exhibited, his, les, baigneuses, the, bathers, and, his, monumental, le, d, piquage, des, moissons, harvest, threshing, this, work, along, with, la, ville, de, paris, city, of, paris, by, robert, delaunay, was, the, largest, and, most, ambitious, cubist, painting, undertaken, during, the, pre, war, cubist, period, in, 1905, a, group, of, four, german, artists, led, by, ernst, ludwig, kirchner, formed, die, br, cke, the, bridge, in, the, city, of, dresden, this, was, arguably, the, founding, organization, for, the, german, expressionist, movement, though, they, did, not, use, the, word, itself, a, few, years, later, in, 1911, a, like, minded, group, of, young, artists, formed, der, blaue, reiter, the, blue, rider, in, munich, the, name, came, from, wassily, kandinsky, s, der, blaue, reiter, painting, of, 1903, among, their, members, were, kandinsky, franz, marc, paul, klee, and, august, macke, however, the, term, expressionism, did, not, firmly, establish, itself, until, 1913, 274, though, initially, mainly, a, german, artistic, movement, most, predominant, in, painting, poetry, and, the, theatre, between, 1910, and, 1930, most, precursors, of, the, movement, were, not, german, furthermore, there, have, been, expressionist, writers, of, prose, fiction, as, well, as, non, german, speaking, expressionist, writers, and, while, the, movement, had, declined, in, germany, with, the, rise, of, adolf, hitler, in, the, 1930s, there, were, subsequent, expressionist, works, expressionism, is, notoriously, difficult, to, define, in, part, because, it, overlapped, with, other, major, isms, of, the, modernist, period, with, futurism, vorticism, cubism, surrealism, and, dada, richard, murphy, also, comments, search, for, an, all, inclusive, definition, is, problematic, to, the, extent, that, the, most, challenging, expressionists, such, as, the, novelist, franz, kafka, poet, gottfried, benn, and, novelist, alfred, d, blin, were, simultaneously, the, most, vociferous, anti, expressionists, 43, what, however, can, be, said, is, that, it, was, a, movement, that, developed, in, the, early, 20th, century, mainly, in, germany, in, reaction, to, the, dehumanizing, effect, of, industrialization, and, the, growth, of, cities, and, that, one, of, the, central, means, by, which, expressionism, identifies, itself, as, an, avant, garde, movement, and, by, which, it, marks, its, distance, to, traditions, and, the, cultural, institution, as, a, whole, is, through, its, relationship, to, realism, and, the, dominant, conventions, of, representation, 43, more, explicitly, the, expressionists, rejected, the, ideology, of, realism, 43, 48, there, was, a, concentrated, expressionist, movement, in, early, 20th, century, german, theater, of, which, georg, kaiser, and, ernst, toller, were, the, most, famous, playwrights, other, notable, expressionist, dramatists, included, reinhard, sorge, walter, hasenclever, hans, henny, jahnn, and, arnolt, bronnen, they, looked, back, to, swedish, playwright, august, strindberg, and, german, actor, and, dramatist, frank, wedekind, as, precursors, of, their, dramaturgical, experiments, oskar, kokoschka, s, murderer, the, hope, of, women, was, the, first, fully, expressionist, work, for, the, theater, which, opened, on, 4, july, 1909, in, vienna, the, extreme, simplification, of, characters, to, mythic, types, choral, effects, declamatory, dialogue, and, heightened, intensity, would, become, characteristic, of, later, expressionist, plays, the, first, full, length, expressionist, play, was, the, son, by, walter, hasenclever, which, was, published, in, 1914, and, first, performed, in, 1916, futurism, is, another, modernist, movement, in, 1909, the, parisian, newspaper, le, figaro, published, f, t, marinetti, s, first, manifesto, soon, afterward, a, group, of, painters, giacomo, balla, umberto, boccioni, carlo, carr, luigi, russolo, and, gino, severini, co, signed, the, futurist, manifesto, modeled, on, marx, and, engels, famous, communist, manifesto, 1848, such, manifestos, put, forward, ideas, that, were, meant, to, provoke, and, to, gather, followers, however, arguments, in, favor, of, geometric, or, purely, abstract, painting, were, at, this, time, largely, confined, to, little, magazines, which, had, only, tiny, circulations, modernist, primitivism, and, pessimism, were, controversial, and, the, mainstream, in, the, first, decade, of, the, 20th, century, was, still, inclined, towards, a, faith, in, progress, and, liberal, optimism, abstract, artists, taking, as, their, examples, the, impressionists, as, well, as, paul, c, zanne, 1839, 1906, and, edvard, munch, 1863, 1944, began, with, the, assumption, that, color, and, shape, not, the, depiction, of, the, natural, world, formed, the, essential, characteristics, of, art, western, art, had, been, from, the, renaissance, up, to, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, underpinned, by, the, logic, of, perspective, and, an, attempt, to, reproduce, an, illusion, of, visible, reality, the, arts, of, cultures, other, than, the, european, had, become, accessible, and, showed, alternative, ways, of, describing, visual, experience, to, the, artist, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, many, artists, felt, a, need, to, create, a, new, kind, of, art, that, encompassed, the, fundamental, changes, taking, place, in, technology, science, and, philosophy, the, sources, from, which, individual, artists, drew, their, theoretical, arguments, were, diverse, and, reflected, the, social, and, intellectual, preoccupations, in, all, areas, of, western, culture, at, that, time, wassily, kandinsky, piet, mondrian, and, kazimir, malevich, all, believed, in, redefining, art, as, the, arrangement, of, pure, color, the, use, of, photography, which, had, rendered, much, of, the, representational, function, of, visual, art, obsolete, strongly, affected, this, aspect, of, modernism, modernist, architects, and, designers, such, as, frank, lloyd, wright, and, le, corbusier, believed, that, new, technology, rendered, old, styles, of, building, obsolete, le, corbusier, thought, that, buildings, should, function, as, machines, for, living, in, analogous, to, cars, which, he, saw, as, machines, for, traveling, in, just, as, cars, had, replaced, the, horse, so, modernist, design, should, reject, the, old, styles, and, structures, inherited, from, ancient, greece, or, the, middle, ages, following, this, machine, aesthetic, modernist, designers, typically, rejected, decorative, motifs, in, design, preferring, to, emphasize, the, materials, used, and, pure, geometrical, forms, the, skyscraper, is, the, archetypal, modernist, building, and, the, wainwright, building, a, 10, story, office, building, completed, in, 1891, in, st, louis, missouri, united, states, is, among, the, first, skyscrapers, in, the, world, ludwig, mies, van, der, rohe, s, seagram, building, in, new, york, 1956, 1958, is, often, regarded, as, the, pinnacle, of, this, modernist, high, rise, architecture, many, aspects, of, modernist, design, persist, within, the, mainstream, of, contemporary, architecture, though, previous, dogmatism, has, given, way, to, a, more, playful, use, of, decoration, historical, quotation, and, spatial, drama, in, 1913, which, was, the, year, of, philosopher, edmund, husserl, s, ideas, physicist, niels, bohr, s, quantized, atom, ezra, pound, s, founding, of, imagism, the, armory, show, in, new, york, and, in, saint, petersburg, the, first, futurist, opera, mikhail, matyushin, s, victory, over, the, sun, another, russian, composer, igor, stravinsky, composed, the, rite, of, spring, a, ballet, that, depicts, human, sacrifice, and, has, a, musical, score, full, of, dissonance, and, primitive, rhythm, this, caused, an, uproar, on, its, first, performance, in, paris, at, this, time, though, modernism, was, still, progressive, it, increasingly, saw, traditional, forms, and, social, arrangements, as, hindering, progress, and, recast, the, artist, as, a, revolutionary, engaged, in, overthrowing, rather, than, enlightening, society, also, in, 1913, a, less, violent, event, occurred, in, france, with, the, publication, of, the, first, volume, of, marcel, proust, s, important, novel, sequence, la, recherche, du, temps, perdu, 1913, 1927, in, search, of, lost, time, this, is, often, presented, as, an, early, example, of, a, writer, using, the, stream, of, consciousness, technique, but, robert, humphrey, comments, that, proust, is, concerned, only, with, the, reminiscent, aspect, of, consciousness, and, that, he, was, deliberately, recapturing, the, past, for, the, purpose, of, communicating, hence, he, did, not, write, a, stream, of, consciousness, novel, stream, of, consciousness, was, an, important, modernist, literary, innovation, and, it, has, been, suggested, that, arthur, schnitzler, 1862, 1931, was, the, first, to, make, full, use, of, it, in, his, short, story, leutnant, gustl, none, but, the, brave, 1900, dorothy, richardson, was, the, first, english, writer, to, use, it, in, the, early, volumes, of, her, novel, sequence, pilgrimage, 1915, 1967, other, modernist, novelists, that, are, associated, with, the, use, of, this, narrative, technique, include, james, joyce, in, ulysses, 1922, and, italo, svevo, in, la, coscienza, di, zeno, 1923, however, with, the, coming, of, the, great, war, of, 1914, 1918, world, war, i, and, the, russian, revolution, of, 1917, the, world, was, drastically, changed, and, doubt, was, cast, on, the, beliefs, and, institutions, of, the, past, the, failure, of, the, previous, status, quo, seemed, self, evident, to, a, generation, that, had, seen, millions, die, fighting, over, scraps, of, earth, before, 1914, it, had, been, argued, that, no, one, would, fight, such, a, war, since, the, cost, was, too, high, the, birth, of, a, machine, age, which, had, made, major, changes, in, the, conditions, of, daily, life, in, the, 19th, century, had, now, radically, changed, the, nature, of, warfare, the, traumatic, nature, of, recent, experience, altered, basic, assumptions, and, a, realistic, depiction, of, life, in, the, arts, seemed, inadequate, when, faced, with, the, fantastically, surreal, nature, of, trench, warfare, the, view, that, mankind, was, making, steady, moral, progress, now, seemed, ridiculous, in, the, face, of, the, senseless, slaughter, described, in, works, such, as, erich, maria, remarque, s, novel, all, quiet, on, the, western, front, 1929, therefore, modernism, s, view, of, reality, which, had, been, a, minority, taste, before, the, war, became, more, generally, accepted, in, the, 1920s, in, literature, and, visual, art, some, modernists, sought, to, defy, expectations, mainly, to, make, their, art, more, vivid, or, to, force, the, audience, to, take, the, trouble, to, question, their, own, preconceptions, this, aspect, of, modernism, has, often, seemed, a, reaction, to, consumer, culture, which, developed, in, europe, and, north, america, in, the, late, 19th, century, whereas, most, manufacturers, try, to, make, products, that, will, be, marketable, by, appealing, to, preferences, and, prejudices, high, modernists, reject, such, consumerist, attitudes, to, undermine, conventional, thinking, the, art, critic, clement, greenberg, expounded, this, theory, of, modernism, in, his, essay, avant, garde, and, kitsch, greenberg, labeled, the, products, of, consumer, culture, kitsch, because, their, design, aimed, simply, to, have, maximum, appeal, with, any, difficult, features, removed, for, greenberg, modernism, thus, formed, a, reaction, against, the, development, of, such, examples, of, modern, consumer, culture, as, commercial, popular, music, hollywood, and, advertising, greenberg, associated, this, with, the, revolutionary, rejection, of, capitalism, some, modernists, saw, themselves, as, part, of, a, revolutionary, culture, that, included, political, revolution, in, russia, after, the, 1917, revolution, there, was, indeed, initially, a, burgeoning, of, avant, garde, cultural, activity, which, included, russian, futurism, however, others, rejected, conventional, politics, as, well, as, artistic, conventions, believing, that, a, revolution, of, political, consciousness, had, greater, importance, than, a, change, in, political, structures, but, many, modernists, saw, themselves, as, apolitical, others, such, as, t, s, eliot, rejected, mass, popular, culture, from, a, conservative, position, some, even, argue, that, modernism, in, literature, and, art, functioned, to, sustain, an, elite, culture, that, excluded, the, majority, of, the, population, surrealism, which, originated, in, the, early, 1920s, came, to, be, regarded, by, the, public, as, the, most, extreme, form, of, modernism, or, the, avant, garde, of, modernism, the, word, surrealist, was, coined, by, guillaume, apollinaire, and, first, appeared, in, the, preface, to, his, play, les, mamelles, de, tir, sias, which, was, written, in, 1903, and, first, performed, in, 1917, major, surrealists, include, paul, luard, robert, desnos, max, ernst, hans, arp, antonin, artaud, raymond, queneau, joan, mir, and, marcel, duchamp, by, 1930, modernism, had, won, a, place, in, the, political, and, artistic, establishment, although, by, this, time, modernism, itself, had, changed, modernism, continued, to, evolve, during, the, 1930s, between, 1930, and, 1932, composer, arnold, schoenberg, worked, on, moses, und, aron, one, of, the, first, operas, to, make, use, of, the, twelve, tone, technique, pablo, picasso, painted, in, 1937, guernica, his, cubist, condemnation, of, fascism, while, in, 1939, james, joyce, pushed, the, boundaries, of, the, modern, novel, further, with, finnegans, wake, also, by, 1930, modernism, began, to, influence, mainstream, culture, so, that, for, example, the, new, yorker, magazine, began, publishing, work, influenced, by, modernism, by, young, writers, and, humorists, like, dorothy, parker, robert, benchley, e, b, white, s, j, perelman, and, james, thurber, amongst, others, perelman, is, highly, regarded, for, his, humorous, short, stories, that, he, published, in, magazines, in, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, most, often, in, the, new, yorker, which, are, considered, to, be, the, first, examples, of, surrealist, humor, in, america, modern, ideas, in, art, also, began, to, appear, more, frequently, in, commercials, and, logos, an, early, example, of, which, from, 1916, is, the, famous, london, underground, logo, designed, by, edward, johnston, one, of, the, most, visible, changes, of, this, period, was, the, adoption, of, new, technologies, into, the, daily, lives, of, ordinary, people, in, western, europe, and, north, america, electricity, the, telephone, the, radio, the, automobile, and, the, need, to, work, with, them, repair, them, and, live, with, them, created, social, change, the, kind, of, disruptive, moment, that, only, a, few, knew, in, the, 1880s, became, a, common, occurrence, for, example, the, speed, of, communication, reserved, for, the, stock, brokers, of, 1890, became, part, of, family, life, at, least, in, middle, class, north, america, associated, with, urbanization, and, changing, social, mores, also, came, smaller, families, and, changed, relationships, between, parents, and, their, children, another, strong, influence, at, this, time, was, marxism, after, the, generally, primitivistic, irrationalism, aspect, of, pre, world, war, i, modernism, which, for, many, modernists, precluded, any, attachment, to, merely, political, solutions, and, the, neoclassicism, of, the, 1920s, as, represented, most, famously, by, t, s, eliot, and, igor, stravinsky, which, rejected, popular, solutions, to, modern, problems, the, rise, of, fascism, the, great, depression, and, the, march, to, war, helped, to, radicalize, a, generation, bertolt, brecht, w, h, auden, andr, breton, louis, aragon, and, the, philosophers, antonio, gramsci, and, walter, benjamin, are, perhaps, the, most, famous, exemplars, of, this, modernist, form, of, marxism, there, were, however, also, modernists, explicitly, of, the, right, including, salvador, dal, wyndham, lewis, t, s, eliot, ezra, pound, the, dutch, author, menno, ter, braak, and, others, significant, modernist, literary, works, continued, to, be, created, in, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, including, further, novels, by, marcel, proust, virginia, woolf, robert, musil, and, dorothy, richardson, the, american, modernist, dramatist, eugene, o, neill, s, career, began, in, 1914, but, his, major, works, appeared, in, the, 1920s, 1930s, and, early, 1940s, two, other, significant, modernist, dramatists, writing, in, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, were, bertolt, brecht, and, federico, garc, a, lorca, d, h, lawrence, s, lady, chatterley, s, lover, was, privately, published, in, 1928, while, another, important, landmark, for, the, history, of, the, modern, novel, came, with, the, publication, of, william, faulkner, s, the, sound, and, the, fury, in, 1929, in, the, 1930s, in, addition, to, further, major, works, by, faulkner, samuel, beckett, published, his, first, major, work, the, novel, murphy, 1938, then, in, 1939, james, joyce, s, finnegans, wake, appeared, this, is, written, in, a, largely, idiosyncratic, language, consisting, of, a, mixture, of, standard, english, lexical, items, and, neologistic, multilingual, puns, and, portmanteau, words, which, attempts, to, recreate, the, experience, of, sleep, and, dreams, in, poetry, t, s, eliot, e, e, cummings, and, wallace, stevens, were, writing, from, the, 1920s, until, the, 1950s, while, modernist, poetry, in, english, is, often, viewed, as, an, american, phenomenon, with, leading, exponents, including, ezra, pound, t, s, eliot, marianne, moore, william, carlos, williams, h, d, and, louis, zukofsky, there, were, important, british, modernist, poets, including, david, jones, hugh, macdiarmid, basil, bunting, and, w, h, auden, european, modernist, poets, include, federico, garc, a, lorca, anna, akhmatova, constantine, cavafy, and, paul, val, ry, the, modernist, movement, continued, during, this, period, in, soviet, russia, in, 1930, composer, dimitri, shostakovich, s, 1906, 1975, opera, the, nose, was, premiered, in, which, he, uses, a, montage, of, different, styles, including, folk, music, popular, song, and, atonality, among, his, influences, was, alban, berg, s, 1885, 1935, opera, wozzeck, 1925, which, had, made, a, tremendous, impression, on, shostakovich, when, it, was, staged, in, leningrad, however, from, 1932, socialist, realism, began, to, oust, modernism, in, the, soviet, union, and, in, 1936, shostakovich, was, attacked, and, forced, to, withdraw, his, 4th, symphony, alban, berg, wrote, another, significant, though, incomplete, modernist, opera, lulu, which, premiered, in, 1937, berg, s, violin, concerto, was, first, performed, in, 1935, like, shostakovich, other, composers, faced, difficulties, in, this, period, in, germany, arnold, schoenberg, 1874, 1951, was, forced, to, flee, to, the, u, s, when, hitler, came, to, power, in, 1933, because, of, his, modernist, atonal, style, as, well, as, his, jewish, ancestry, his, major, works, from, this, period, are, a, violin, concerto, op, 36, 1934, 36, and, a, piano, concerto, op, 42, 1942, schoenberg, also, wrote, tonal, music, in, this, period, with, the, suite, for, strings, in, g, major, 1935, and, the, chamber, symphony, no, 2, in, e, minor, op, 38, begun, in, 1906, completed, in, 1939, during, this, time, hungarian, modernist, b, la, bart, k, 1881, 1945, produced, a, number, of, major, works, including, music, for, strings, percussion, and, celesta, 1936, and, the, divertimento, for, string, orchestra, 1939, string, quartet, no, 5, 1934, and, no, 6, his, last, 1939, but, he, too, left, for, the, us, in, 1940, because, of, the, rise, of, fascism, in, hungary, igor, stravinsky, 1882, 1971, continued, writing, in, his, neoclassical, style, during, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, writing, works, like, the, symphony, of, psalms, 1930, symphony, in, c, 1940, and, symphony, in, three, movements, 1945, he, also, emigrated, to, the, us, because, of, world, war, ii, olivier, messiaen, 1908, 1992, however, served, in, the, french, army, during, the, war, and, was, imprisoned, at, stalag, viii, a, by, the, germans, where, he, composed, his, famous, quatuor, pour, la, fin, du, temps, quartet, for, the, end, of, time, the, quartet, was, first, performed, in, january, 1941, to, an, audience, of, prisoners, and, prison, guards, in, painting, during, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, and, the, great, depression, modernism, was, defined, by, surrealism, late, cubism, bauhaus, de, stijl, dada, german, expressionism, and, modernist, and, masterful, color, painters, like, henri, matisse, and, pierre, bonnard, as, well, as, the, abstractions, of, artists, like, piet, mondrian, and, wassily, kandinsky, which, characterized, the, european, art, scene, in, germany, max, beckmann, otto, dix, george, grosz, and, others, politicized, their, paintings, foreshadowing, the, coming, of, world, war, ii, while, in, america, modernism, is, seen, in, the, form, of, american, scene, painting, and, the, social, realism, and, regionalism, movements, that, contained, both, political, and, social, commentary, dominated, the, art, world, artists, like, ben, shahn, thomas, hart, benton, grant, wood, george, tooker, john, steuart, curry, reginald, marsh, and, others, became, prominent, modernism, is, defined, in, latin, america, by, painters, joaqu, n, torres, garc, a, from, uruguay, and, rufino, tamayo, from, mexico, while, the, muralist, movement, with, diego, rivera, david, siqueiros, jos, clemente, orozco, pedro, nel, g, mez, and, santiago, mart, nez, delgado, and, symbolist, paintings, by, frida, kahlo, began, a, renaissance, of, the, arts, for, the, region, characterized, by, a, freer, use, of, color, and, an, emphasis, on, political, messages, diego, rivera, is, perhaps, best, known, by, the, public, world, for, his, 1933, mural, man, at, the, crossroads, in, the, lobby, of, the, rca, building, at, rockefeller, center, when, his, patron, nelson, rockefeller, discovered, that, the, mural, included, a, portrait, of, vladimir, lenin, and, other, communist, imagery, he, fired, rivera, and, the, unfinished, work, was, eventually, destroyed, by, rockefeller, s, staff, frida, kahlo, s, works, are, often, characterized, by, their, stark, portrayals, of, pain, kahlo, was, deeply, influenced, by, indigenous, mexican, culture, which, is, apparent, in, her, paintings, bright, colors, and, dramatic, symbolism, christian, and, jewish, themes, are, often, depicted, in, her, work, as, well, she, combined, elements, of, the, classic, religious, mexican, tradition, which, were, often, bloody, and, violent, frida, kahlo, s, symbolist, works, relate, strongly, to, surrealism, and,

his, forms, are, usually, abstractions, of, the, human, figure, typically, depicting, mother, and, child, or, reclining, figures, usually, suggestive, of, the, female, body, apart, from, a, phase, in, the, 1950s, when, he, sculpted, family, groups, his, forms, are, generally, pierced, or, contain, hollow, spaces, in, the, 1950s, moore, began, to, receive, increasingly, significant, commissions, including, a, reclining, figure, for, the, unesco, building, in, paris, in, 1958, with, many, more, public, works, of, art, the, scale, of, moore, s, sculptures, grew, significantly, the, last, three, decades, of, moore, s, life, continued, in, a, similar, vein, with, several, major, retrospectives, taking, place, around, the, world, notably, a, prominent, exhibition, in, the, summer, of, 1972, in, the, grounds, of, the, forte, di, belvedere, overlooking, florence, by, the, end, of, the, 1970s, there, were, some, 40, exhibitions, a, year, featuring, his, work, on, the, campus, of, the,

for, his, bold, graphic, and, emotionally, raw, imagery, his, painterly, but, abstracted, figures, typically, appear, isolated, in, glass, or, steel, geometrical, cages, set, against, flat, nondescript, backgrounds, bacon, began, painting, during, his, early, 20s, but, worked, only, sporadically, until, his, mid, 30s, his, breakthrough, came, with, the, 1944, triptych, three, studies, for, figures, at, the, base, of, a, crucifixion, which, sealed, his, reputation, as, a, uniquely, bleak, chronicler, of, the, human, condition, his, output, can, be, crudely, described, as, consisting, of, sequences, or, variations, on, a, single, motif, beginning, with, the, 1940s, male, heads, isolated, in, rooms, the, early, 1950s, screaming, popes, and, mid, to, late, 1950s, animals, and, lone, figures, suspended, in, geometric, structures, these, were, followed, by, his, early, 1960s, modern, variations, of, the, crucifixion, in, the, triptych, format, from, the, mid, 1960s, to, early, 1970s, bacon, mainly, produced, strikingly, compassionate, portraits, of, friends, following, the, suicide, of, his, lover, george, dyer, in, 1971, his, art, became, more, personal, inward,

chiefly, for, his, thickly, impastoed, portrait, and, figure, paintings, who, was, widely, considered, the, pre, eminent, british, artist, of, his, time, his, works, are, noted, for, their, psychological, penetration, and, for, their, often, discomforting, examination, of, the, relationship, between, artist, and, model, according, to, william, grimes, of, the, new, york, times, lucien,

expanded, to, encompass, a, movement, in, music, that, features, such, repetition, and, iteration, as, those, of, the, compositions, of, la, monte, young, terry, riley, steve, reich, philip, glass, and, john, adams, minimalist, compositions, are, sometimes, known, as, systems, music, the, term, minimal, music, is, generally, used, to, describe, a, style, of, music, that, developed, in, america, in, the, late, 1960s, and, 1970s, and, that, was, initially, connected, with, the, composers, the, minimalism, movement, originally, involved, some, composers, and, other, lesser, known, pioneers, included, pauline, oliveros, phill, niblock, and, richard, maxfield, in, europe, the, music, of, louis, andriessen, karel, goeyvaerts, michael, nyman, howard, skempton, eliane, radigue, gavin, bryars, steve, martland, henryk, g, recki, arvo, p, rt, and, john, tavener, in, the, late, 1960s, robert, pincus, witten, coined, the, term, postminimalism, to, describe, minimalist, derived, art, which, had, content, and, contextual, overtones, that, minimalism, rejected, the, term, was, applied, by, pincus, witten, to, the, work, of, eva, hesse, keith, sonnier, richard, serra, and, new, work, by, former, minimalists, robert, smithson, robert, morris, sol, lewitt, barry, le, va, and, others, other, minimalists, including, donald, judd, dan, flavin, carl, andre, agnes, martin, john, mccracken, and, others, continued, to, produce, late, modernist, paintings, and, sculpture, for, the, remainder, of, their, careers, since, then, many, artists, have, embraced, minimal, or, post, minimal, styles, and, the, label, postmodern, has, been, attached, to, them, related, to, abstract, expressionism, was, the, emergence, of, combining, manufactured, items, with, artist, materials, moving, away, from, previous, conventions, of, painting, and, sculpture, the, work, of, robert, rauschenberg, exemplifies, this, trend, his, combines, of, the, 1950s, were, forerunners, of, pop, art, and, installation, art, and, used, assemblages, of, large, physical, objects, including, stuffed, animals, birds, and, commercial, photographs, rauschenberg, jasper, johns, larry, rivers, john, chamberlain, claes, oldenburg, george, segal, jim, dine, and, edward, kienholz, were, among, important, pioneers, of, both, abstraction, and, pop, art, creating, new, conventions, of, art, making, they, made, acceptable, in, serious, contemporary, art, circles, the, radical, inclusion, in, their, works, of, unlikely, materials, another, pioneer, of, collage, was, joseph, cornell, whose, more, intimately, scaled, works, were, seen, as, radical, because, of, both, his, personal, iconography, and, his, use, of, found, objects, in, 1917, marcel, duchamp, submitted, a, urinal, as, a, sculpture, for, the, inaugural, exhibition, of, the, society, of, independent, artists, which, was, to, be, staged, at, the, grand, central, palace, in, new, york, he, professed, his, intent, that, people, look, at, the, urinal, as, if, it, were, a, work, of, art, because, he, said, it, was, a, work, of, art, this, urinal, named, fountain, was, signed, with, the, pseudonym, r, mutt, it, is, also, an, example, of, what, duchamp, would, later, call, readymades, this, and, duchamp, s, other, works, are, generally, labelled, as, dada, duchamp, can, be, seen, as, a, precursor, to, conceptual, art, other, famous, examples, being, john, cage, s, 4, 33, which, is, four, minutes, and, thirty, three, seconds, of, silence, and, rauschenberg, s, erased, de, kooning, drawing, many, conceptual, works, take, the, position, that, art, is, the, result, of, the, viewer, viewing, an, object, or, act, as, art, not, of, the, intrinsic, qualities, of, the, work, itself, in, choosing, an, ordinary, article, of, life, and, creating, a, new, thought, for, that, object, duchamp, invited, onlookers, to, view, fountain, as, a, sculpture, marcel, duchamp, famously, gave, up, art, in, favor, of, chess, avant, garde, composer, david, tudor, created, a, piece, reunion, 1968, written, jointly, with, lowell, cross, that, features, a, chess, game, in, which, each, move, triggers, a, lighting, effect, or, projection,

by, duchamp, between, modernism, and, postmodernism, both, used, images, of, ordinary, objects, or, the, objects, themselves, in, their, work, while, retaining, the, abstraction, and, painterly, gestures, of, high, modernism, during, the, late, 1950s, and, 1960s, artists, with, a, wide, range, of, interests, began, to, push, the, boundaries, of, contemporary, art, yves, klein, in, france, carolee, schneemann, yayoi, kusama, charlotte, moorman, and, yoko, ono, in, new, york, city, and, joseph, beuys, wolf, vostell, and, nam, june, paik, in, germany, were, pioneers, of, performance, based, works, of, art, groups, like, the, living, theatre, with, julian, beck, and, judith, malina, collaborated, with, sculptors, and, painters, to, create, environments, radically, changing, the, relationship, between, audience, and, performer, especially, in, their, piece, paradise, now, the, judson, dance, theater, located, at, the, judson, memorial, church, new, york, and, the, judson,

sound, often, with, audience, participation, they, were, characterized, by, the, reductive, philosophies, of, minimalism, and, the, spontaneous, improvisation, and, expressivity, of, abstract,

especially, as, according, to, andreas, huyssen, one, critic, s, postmodernism, is, another, critic, s, modernism, this, includes, those, who, are, critical, of, the, division, between, the, two, see, them, as, two, aspects, of, the, same, movement, and, believe, that, late, modernism, continues, modernism, is, an, all, encompassing, label, for, a, wide, variety, of, cultural, movements, postmodernism, is, essentially, a, centralized, movement, that, named, itself, based, on, socio, political, theory, although, the, term, is, now, used, in, a, wider, sense, to, refer, to, activities, from, the, 20th, century, onwards, which, exhibit, awareness, of, and, reinterpret, the, modern, postmodern, theory, asserts, that, the, attempt, to, canonize, modernism, after, the, fact, is, doomed, to, unresolvable, contradictions, and, since, the, crux, of, postmodernism, critiques, any, claim, to, a, single, discernible, truth, postmodernism, and, modernism, conflict, on, the, existence, of, truth, where, modernists, approach, the, issue, of, truth, with, different, theories, correspondence, coherence, pragmatist, semantic, etc, postmodernists, approach, the, issue, of, truth, negatively, by, disproving, the, very, existence, of, an, accessible, truth, in, a, narrower, sense, what, was, modernist, was, not, necessarily, also, postmodernist, those, elements, of, modernism, which, accentuated, the, benefits, of, rationality, and, socio, technological, progress, were, only, modernist, modernist, reactions, against, postmodernism, include, remodernism, which, rejects, the, cynicism, and, deconstruction, of, postmodern, art, in, favor, of, reviving, early, modernist, aesthetic, currents, although, artistic, modernism, tended, to, reject, capitalist, values, such, as, consumerism, 20th, century, civil, society, embraced, global, mass, production, and, the, proliferation, of, cheap, and, accessible, commodities, this, period, of, social, development, is, known, as, late, or, high, modernity, and, originates, in, advanced, in, western, societies, the, german, sociologist, j, rgen, habermas, in, the, theory, of, communicative, action, 1981, developed, the, first, substantive, critique, of, the, culture, of, late, modernity, another, important, early, critique, of, late, modernity, is, the, american, sociologist, george, ritzer, s, the, mcdonaldization, of, society, 1993, ritzer, describes, how, late, modernity, became, saturated, with, fast, food, consumer, culture, other, authors, have, demonstrated, how, modernist, devices, appeared, in, popular, cinema, and, later, on, in, music, videos, modernist, design, has, entered, the, mainstream, of, popular, culture, as, simplified, and, stylized, forms, became, popular, often, associated, with, dreams, of, a, space, age, high, tech, future, in, 2008, janet, bennett, published, modernity, and, its, critics, through, the, oxford, handbook, of, political, theory, merging, of, consumer, and, high, end, versions, of, modernist, culture, led, to, a, radical, transformation, of, the, meaning, of, modernism, first, it, implied, that, a, movement, based, on, the, rejection, of, tradition, had, become, a, tradition, of, its, own, second, it, demonstrated, that, the, distinction, between, elite, modernist, and, mass, consumerist, culture, had, lost, its, precision, modernism, had, become, so, institutionalized, that, it, was, now, post, avant, garde, indicating, that, it, had, lost, its, power, as, a, revolutionary, movement, many, have, interpreted, this, transformation, as, the, beginning, of, the, phase, that, became, known, as, postmodernism, for, others, such, as, art, critic, robert, hughes, postmodernism, represents, an, extension, of, modernism, anti, modern, or, counter, modern, movements, seek, to, emphasize, holism, connection, and, spirituality, as, remedies, or, antidotes, to, modernism, such, movements, see, modernism, as, reductionist, and, therefore, subject, to, an, inability, to, see, systemic, and, emergent, effects, some, traditionalist, artists, like, alexander, stoddart, reject, modernism, generally, as, the, product, of, an, epoch, of, false, money, allied, with, false, culture, in, some, fields, the, effects, of, modernism, have, remained, stronger, and, more, persistent, than, in, others, visual, art, has, made, the, most, complete, break, with, its, past, most, major, capital, cities, have, museums, devoted, to, modern, art, as, distinct, from, post, renaissance, art, c, 1400, to, c, 1900, examples, include, the, museum, of, modern, art, in, new, york, the, tate, modern, in, london, and, the, centre, pompidou, in, paris, these, galleries, make, no, distinction, between, modernist, and, postmodernist, phases,
