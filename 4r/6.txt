architectural, theory, is, the, act, of, thinking, discussing, and, writing, about, architecture, architectural, theory, is, taught, in, all, architecture, schools, and, is, practiced, by, the, world, s, leading, architects, some, forms, that, architecture, theory, takes, are, the, lecture, or, dialogue, the, treatise, or, book, and, the, paper, project, or, competition, entry, architectural, theory, is, often, didactic, and, theorists, tend, to, stay, close, to, or, work, from, within, schools, it, has, existed, in, some, form, since, antiquity, and, as, publishing, became, more, common, architectural, theory, gained, an, increased, richness, books, magazines, and, journals, published, an, unprecedented, number, of, works, by, architects, and, critics, in, the, 20th, century, as, a, result, styles, and, movements, formed, and, dissolved, much, more, quickly, than, the, relatively, enduring, modes, in, earlier, history, it, is, to, be, expected, that, the, use, of, the, internet, will, further, the, discourse, on, architecture, in, the, 21st, century, there, is, little, information, or, evidence, about, major, architectural, theory, in, antiquity, until, the, 1st, century, bc, with, the, work, of, vitruvius, this, does, not, mean, however, that, such, works, did, not, exist, given, that, many, works, never, survived, antiquity, vitruvius, was, a, roman, writer, architect, and, engineer, active, in, the, 1st, century, bc, he, was, the, most, prominent, architectural, theorist, in, the, roman, empire, known, today, having, written, de, architectura, known, today, as, the, ten, books, of, architecture, a, treatise, written, in, latin, and, greek, on, architecture, dedicated, to, the, emperor, augustus, probably, written, between, 27, and, 23, bc, it, is, the, only, major, contemporary, source, on, classical, architecture, to, have, survived, divided, into, ten, sections, or, books, it, covers, almost, every, aspect, of, roman, architecture, from, town, planning, materials, decorations, temples, water, supplies, etc, it, rigorously, defines, the, classical, orders, of, architecture, it, also, proposes, the, three, fundamental, laws, that, architecture, must, obey, in, order, to, be, so, considered, firmitas, utilitas, venustas, translated, in, the, 17th, century, by, sir, henry, wotton, into, the, english, slogan, firmness, commodity, and, delight, meaning, structural, adequacy, functional, adequacy, and, beauty, the, rediscovery, of, vitruvius, work, in, 1414, had, a, profound, influence, on, architects, of, the, renaissance, adding, archaeological, underpinnings, to, the, rise, of, the, renaissance, style, which, was, already, under, way, renaissance, architects, such, as, brunelleschi, and, leon, battista, alberti, found, in, de, architectura, their, rationale, for, raising, their, branch, of, knowledge, to, a, scientific, discipline, vastu, shastra, v, stu, stra, literally, science, of, architecture, are, texts, on, the, traditional, indian, system, of, architecture, these, texts, describe, principles, of, design, layout, measurements, ground, preparation, space, arrangement, and, spatial, geometry, the, designs, aim, to, integrate, architecture, with, nature, the, relative, functions, of, various, parts, of, the, structure, and, ancient, beliefs, utilising, geometric, patterns, yantra, symmetry, and, directional, alignments, vastu, shastra, are, the, textual, part, of, vastu, vidya, the, broader, knowledge, about, architecture, and, design, theories, from, ancient, india, varahamihira, s, brihat, samhita, dated, to, about, the, sixth, century, ce, is, among, the, earliest, known, indian, texts, with, dedicated, chapters, with, principles, of, architecture, for, example, chapter, 53, of, the, brihat, samhita, is, titled, on, architecture, and, there, and, elsewhere, it, discusses, elements, of, vastu, sastra, such, as, planning, cities, and, buildings, and, house, structures, orientation, storeys, building, balconies, along, with, other, topics, other, ancient, vastu, shastra, works, includes, manasara, etc, following, the, tradition, of, vastu, shastra, several, scholars, wrote, architectural, texts, during, medieval, times, which, includes, manushyalaya, chandrika, dealing, with, domestic, architecture, authored, by, thirumangalath, neelakanthan, musath, samrangana, sutradhara, written, by, bhoja, of, dhar, a, poetic, treatise, on, classical, indian, architecture, among, others, throughout, the, middle, ages, architectural, knowledge, was, passed, by, transcription, word, of, mouth, and, technically, in, master, builders, lodges, due, to, the, laborious, nature, of, transcription, few, examples, of, architectural, theory, were, penned, during, this, time, most, written, works, during, this, period, were, theological, and, were, transcriptions, of, the, bible, since, the, architectural, theories, were, on, structures, fewer, of, them, were, transcribed, the, abbot, suger, s, liber, de, rebus, in, administratione, sua, gestis, was, an, architectural, document, that, emerged, with, gothic, architecture, another, was, villard, de, honnecourt, s, portfolio, of, drawings, from, about, the, 1230s, in, song, dynasty, china, li, jie, published, the, yingzao, fashi, in, 1103, which, was, an, architectural, treatise, that, codified, elements, of, chinese, architecture, the, first, great, work, of, architectural, theory, of, this, period, belongs, to, sabona, de, re, aedificatoria, which, placed, vitruvius, at, the, core, of, the, most, profound, theoretical, tradition, of, the, modern, ages, from, alberti, good, architecture, is, validated, through, the, vitruvian, triad, which, defines, its, purpose, this, triplet, conserved, all, its, validity, until, the, 19th, century, a, major, transition, into, the, 17th, century, and, ultimately, to, the, age, of, enlightenment, was, secured, through, the, advanced, mathematical, and, optical, research, of, the, celebrated, architect, and, geometer, girard, desargues, with, an, emphasis, on, his, studies, on, conics, perspective, and, projective, geometry, the, age, of, the, enlightenment, witnessed, considerable, development, in, architectural, theory, on, the, european, continent, new, archaeological, discoveries, such, as, those, of, pompeii, and, herculaneum, drove, new, interest, in, classical, art, and, architecture, thus, the, term, neoclassicism, exemplified, by, the, writings, of, prussian, art, critic, johann, joachim, winckelmann, arose, to, designate, 18th, century, architecture, which, looked, to, these, new, classical, precedents, for, inspiration, in, building, design, major, architectural, theorists, of, the, enlightenment, include, julien, david, le, roy, abb, marc, antoine, laugier, giovanni, battista, piranesi, robert, adam, james, stuart, georg, friedrich, hegel, and, nicholas, revett, a, vibrant, strain, of, neoclassicism, inherited, from, marc, antoine, laugier, s, seminal, essai, provided, the, foundation, for, two, generations, of, international, activity, around, the, core, themes, of, classicism, primitivism, and, a, return, to, nature, reaction, against, the, dominance, of, neoclassical, architecture, came, to, the, fore, in, the, 1820s, with, augustus, pugin, providing, a, moral, and, theoretical, basis, for, gothic, revival, architecture, and, in, the, 1840s, john, ruskin, developed, this, ethos, the, american, sculptor, horatio, greenough, published, the, essay, american, architecture, in, august, 1843, in, which, he, rejected, the, imitation, of, old, styles, of, buildings, and, outlined, the, functional, relationship, between, architecture, and, decoration, these, theories, anticipated, the, development, of, functionalism, in, modern, architecture, towards, the, end, of, the, century, there, occurred, a, blossoming, of, theoretical, activity, in, england, ruskin, s, ideals, underpinned, the, emergence, of, the, arts, and, crafts, movement, exemplified, by, the, writings, of, william, morris, this, in, turn, formed, the, basis, for, art, nouveau, in, the, uk, exemplified, by, the, work, of, charles, rennie, mackintosh, and, influenced, the, vienna, secession, on, the, continent, the, theories, of, viollet, le, duc, and, gottfried, semper, provided, the, springboard, for, enormous, vitality, of, thought, dedicated, to, architectural, innovation, and, the, renovation, of, the, notion, of, style, semper, in, particular, developed, an, international, following, in, germany, england, switzerland, austria, bohemia, france, italy, and, the, united, states, the, generation, born, during, the, middle, third, of, the, 19th, century, was, largely, enthralled, with, the, opportunities, presented, by, semper, s, combination, of, a, breathtaking, historical, scope, and, a, methodological, granularity, in, contrast, to, more, recent, and, thus, modern, thematically, self, organized, theoretical, activities, this, generation, did, not, coalesce, into, a, movement, they, did, however, seem, to, converge, on, semper, s, use, of, the, concept, of, realismus, and, they, are, thus, labelled, proponents, of, architectural, realism, among, the, most, active, architectural, realists, were, georg, heuser, rudolf, redtenbacher, constantin, lipsius, hans, auer, paul, s, dille, lawrence, harvey, architect, lawrence, harvey, otto, wagner, and, richard, streiter, in, 1889, camillo, sitte, published, der, st, dtebau, nach, seinem, k, nstlerischen, grunds, tzen, translated, as, city, planning, according, to, artistic, principles, which, was, not, exactly, a, criticism, of, architectural, form, but, an, aesthetic, criticism, inspired, by, medieval, and, baroque, town, planning, of, 19th, century, urbanism, mainly, a, theoretical, work, it, had, an, immediate, impact, on, architecture, as, the, two, disciplines, of, architecture, and, planning, intertwined, demand, for, it, was, so, high, that, five, editions, appeared, in, german, between, 1889, and, 1922, and, a, french, translation, came, out, in, 1902, no, english, edition, came, out, until, 1945, for, sitte, the, most, important, issue, was, not, the, architectural, shape, or, form, of, a, building, but, the, quality, of, the, urban, spaces, that, buildings, collectively, enclose, the, whole, being, more, than, the, sum, of, its, parts, the, modern, movement, rejected, these, thoughts, and, le, corbusier, energetically, dismissed, the, work, nevertheless, sitte, s, work, was, revisited, by, post, modern, architects, and, theorists, from, the, 1970s, especially, following, its, republication, in, 1986, by, rizzoli, in, an, edition, edited, by, collins, and, collins, now, published, by, dover, the, book, is, often, cited, anachronistically, today, as, a, vehicle, for, the, criticism, of, the, modern, movement, also, on, the, topic, of, artistic, notions, with, regard, to, urbanism, was, louis, sullivan, s, the, tall, office, building, artistically, considered, of, 1896, in, this, essay, sullivan, penned, his, famous, alliterative, adage, form, ever, follows, function, a, phrase, that, was, to, be, later, adopted, as, a, central, tenet, of, modern, architectural, theory, while, later, architects, adopted, the, abbreviated, phrase, form, follows, function, as, a, polemic, in, service, of, functionalist, doctrine, sullivan, wrote, of, function, with, regard, to, biological, functions, of, the, natural, order, another, influential, planning, theorist, of, this, time, was, ebenezer, howard, who, founded, the, garden, city, movement, this, movement, aimed, to, form, communities, with, architecture, in, the, arts, and, crafts, style, at, letchworth, and, welwyn, garden, city, and, popularised, the, style, as, domestic, architecture, in, vienna, the, idea, of, a, radically, new, modern, architecture, had, many, theorists, and, proponents, an, early, use, of, the, term, modern, architecture, in, print, occurred, in, the, title, of, a, book, by, otto, wagner, who, gave, examples, of, his, own, work, representative, of, the, vienna, secession, with, art, nouveau, illustrations, and, didactic, teachings, to, his, students, soon, thereafter, adolf, loos, wrote, ornament, and, crime, and, while, his, own, style, is, usually, seen, in, the, context, of, the, jugendstil, his, demand, for, the, elimination, of, ornament, joined, the, slogan, form, follows, function, as, a, principle, of, the, architectural, so, called, modern, movement, that, came, to, dominate, the, mid, 20th, century, walter, gropius, ludwig, mies, van, der, rohe, and, le, corbusier, provided, the, theoretical, basis, for, the, international, style, with, aims, of, using, industrialised, architecture, to, reshape, society, frank, lloyd, wright, while, modern, in, rejecting, historic, revivalism, was, idiosyncratic, in, his, theory, which, he, conveyed, in, copious, writing, wright, did, not, subscribe, to, the, tenets, of, the, international, style, but, evolved, what, he, hoped, would, be, an, american, in, contrast, to, a, european, progressive, course, wright, s, style, however, was, highly, personal, involving, his, particular, views, of, man, and, nature, wright, was, more, poetic, and, firmly, maintained, the, 19th, century, view, of, the, creative, artist, as, unique, genius, this, limited, the, relevance, of, his, theoretical, propositions, towards, the, end, of, the, century, postmodern, architecture, reacted, against, the, austerity, of, high, modern, international, style, principles, viewed, as, narrowly, normative, and, doctrinaire, in, contemporary, architectural, discourse, theory, has, become, more, concerned, with, its, position, within, culture, generally, and, thought, in, particular, this, is, why, university, courses, on, architecture, theory, may, often, spend, just, as, much, time, discussing, philosophy, and, cultural, studies, as, buildings, and, why, advanced, postgraduate, research, and, doctoral, dissertations, focus, on, philosophical, topics, in, connection, with, architectural, humanities, some, architectural, theorists, aim, at, discussing, philosophical, themes, or, engage, in, direct, dialogues, with, philosophers, as, in, the, case, of, peter, eisenman, s, and, bernard, tschumi, s, interest, in, derrida, s, thought, or, anthony, vidler, s, interest, in, the, works, of, freud, and, lacan, in, addition, to, an, interest, in, gaston, bachelard, s, poetics, of, space, or, texts, by, gilles, deleuze, this, has, also, been, the, case, with, educators, in, academia, like, dalibor, vesely, or, alberto, perez, gomez, and, in, more, recent, years, this, philosophical, orientation, has, been, reinforced, through, the, research, of, a, new, generation, of, theorists, e, g, jeffrey, kipnis, or, sanford, kwinter, similarly, we, can, refer, to, contemporary, architects, who, are, interested, in, philosophy, and, cultural, studies, some, are, interested, in, phenomenology, and, neuroaesthetics, like, sarah, williams, goldhagen, sarah, robinson, and, christian, norberg, schulz, or, specialize, as, philosophers, and, historians, of, science, such, as, nader, el, bizri, who, is, also, a, notable, phenomenologist, especially, in, heidegger, studies, others, like, beatriz, colomina, and, mary, mcleod, expand, historical, understandings, of, architecture, to, include, lesser, or, minor, discourses, that, have, influenced, the, development, of, architectural, ideas, over, time, studies, in, feminism, in, architecture, and, in, sexuality, and, gender, as, potent, cultural, expressions, are, also, considered, an, integral, part, of, the, latter, 20th, century, theoretical, discourse, and, are, associated, with, such, persons, as, dolores, hayden, catherine, ingraham, jennifer, bloomer, and, sylvia, lavin, the, notion, that, theory, entails, critique, also, stemmed, from, post, structural, literary, studies, in, the, work, of, many, other, theorists, and, architects, such, as, mark, wigley, and, diana, agrest, among, others, in, their, theories, architecture, is, compared, to, a, language, which, can, be, invented, and, re, invented, every, time, it, is, used, this, theory, influenced, the, so, called, deconstructivist, architecture, in, contrast, network, society, innovators, especially, silicon, valley, software, developers, have, embraced, christopher, alexander, s, emphasis, on, the, timeless, way, of, building, 1979, based, on, pattern, languages, that, are, optimized, on, site, as, construction, unfolds, since, 2000, architectural, theory, has, also, had, to, face, the, rapid, rise, of, urbanism, and, globalization, by, developing, a, new, understanding, of, the, city, many, theorists, developed, new, understandings, of, the, urban, conditions, of, our, planet, e, g, rem, koolhaas, s, bigness, interests, in, fragmentation, and, architecture, as, transient, objects, further, affected, such, thinking, e, g, the, concern, for, employing, high, technology, but, also, related, to, general, concerns, such, as, ecology, mass, media, and, economism, in, the, past, decade, there, has, been, the, emergence, of, the, so, called, digital, architecture, several, currents, and, design, methodologies, are, being, developed, simultaneously, some, of, which, reinforce, each, other, whereas, others, work, in, opposition, one, of, these, trends, is, biomimicry, which, is, the, process, of, examining, nature, its, models, systems, processes, and, elements, to, emulate, or, take, inspiration, from, them, in, order, to, solve, human, problems, architects, also, design, organic, looking, buildings, in, the, attempt, to, develop, a, new, formal, language, another, trend, is, the, exploration, of, those, computational, techniques, that, are, influenced, by, algorithms, relevant, to, biological, processes, and, sometimes, referred, to, as, digital, morphogenesis, trying, to, utilize, computational, creativity, in, architecture, genetic, algorithms, developed, in, computer, science, are, used, to, evolve, designs, on, a, computer, and, some, of, these, are, proposed, and, built, as, actual, structures, since, these, new, architectural, tendencies, emerged, many, theorists, and, architects, have, been, working, on, these, issues, developing, theories, and, ideas, such, as, patrick, schumacher, s, parametricism, contemporary, architecture, s, theoretical, world, is, plural, and, multicolored, there, are, different, dominant, schools, of, architectural, theory, which, are, based, on, linguistic, analysis, philosophy, post, structuralism, or, cultural, theory, for, instance, there, is, emerging, interest, in, the, re, discovery, of, the, post, modernist, project, sam, jacob, in, the, definition, of, new, radical, tendencies, of, architecture, and, its, implication, in, the, development, of, cities, pier, vittorio, aureli, in, the, embrace, of, the, idea, of, discipline, and, in, a, new, formalist, approach, to, architecture, through, the, appropriation, of, concepts, from, the, object, oriented, philosophy, it, is, too, early, however, to, say, whether, any, of, these, explorations, will, have, widespread, or, lasting, impact, on, architecture, in, the, second, decade, of, the, twenty, first, century, there, is, the, emergence, of, architectural, theory, based, on, the, frameworks, of, social, reproduction, theory, and, care, ethics, this, approach, is, introduced, in, doina, petrescu, s, and, kim, trogal, s, edited, a, volume, on, the, social, re, production, of, architecture, and, in, the, volume, critical, care, architecture, and, urbanism, for, a, broken, planet, edited, by, angelika, fitz, and, elke, krasny, anti, architecture
