rub, iy, t, of, omar, khayy, m, is, the, title, that, edward, fitzgerald, gave, to, his, 1859, translation, from, persian, to, english, of, a, selection, of, quatrains, rub, iy, t, attributed, to, omar, khayyam, 1048, 1131, dubbed, the, astronomer, poet, of, persia, although, commercially, unsuccessful, at, first, fitzgerald, s, work, was, popularised, from, 1861, onward, by, whitley, stokes, and, the, work, came, to, be, greatly, admired, by, the, pre, raphaelites, in, england, fitzgerald, had, a, third, edition, printed, in, 1872, which, increased, interest, in, the, work, in, the, united, states, by, the, 1880s, the, book, was, extremely, popular, throughout, the, english, speaking, world, to, the, extent, that, numerous, omar, khayyam, clubs, were, formed, and, there, was, a, fin, de, si, cle, cult, of, the, rubaiyat, fitzgerald, s, work, has, been, published, in, several, hundred, editions, and, has, inspired, similar, translation, efforts, in, english, hindi, and, in, many, other, languages, the, authenticity, of, the, poetry, attributed, to, omar, khayyam, is, highly, uncertain, khayyam, was, famous, during, his, lifetime, not, as, a, poet, but, as, an, astronomer, and, mathematician, the, earliest, reference, to, his, having, written, poetry, is, found, in, his, biography, by, al, isfahani, written, 43, years, after, his, death, this, view, is, reinforced, by, other, medieval, historians, such, as, shahrazuri, 1201, and, al, qifti, 1255, parts, of, the, rubaiyat, appear, as, incidental, quotations, from, omar, in, early, works, of, biography, and, in, anthologies, these, include, works, of, razi, ca, 1160, 1210, daya, 1230, juvayni, ca, 1226, 1283, and, jajarmi, 1340, 92, 434, also, five, quatrains, assigned, to, khayyam, in, somewhat, later, sources, appear, in, zahiri, samarqandi, s, sindbad, nameh, before, 1160, without, attribution, 34, the, number, of, quatrains, attributed, to, him, in, more, recent, collections, varies, from, about, 1, 200, according, to, saeed, nafisi, to, more, than, 2, 000, sceptical, scholars, point, out, that, the, entire, tradition, may, be, pseudepigraphic, 11, the, extant, manuscripts, containing, collections, attributed, to, omar, are, dated, much, too, late, to, enable, a, reconstruction, of, a, body, of, authentic, verses, in, the, 1930s, iranian, scholars, notably, mohammad, ali, foroughi, attempted, to, reconstruct, a, core, of, authentic, verses, from, scattered, quotes, by, authors, of, the, 13th, and, 14th, centuries, ignoring, the, younger, manuscript, tradition, after, world, war, ii, reconstruction, efforts, were, significantly, delayed, by, two, clever, forgeries, de, blois, 2004, is, pessimistic, suggesting, that, contemporary, scholarship, has, not, advanced, beyond, the, situation, of, the, 1930s, when, hans, heinrich, schaeder, commented, that, the, name, of, omar, khayyam, is, to, be, struck, out, from, the, history, of, persian, literature, a, feature, of, the, more, recent, collections, is, the, lack, of, linguistic, homogeneity, and, continuity, of, ideas, sadegh, hedayat, commented, that, if, a, man, had, lived, for, a, hundred, years, and, had, changed, his, religion, philosophy, and, beliefs, twice, a, day, he, could, scarcely, have, given, expression, to, such, a, range, of, ideas, 34, hedayat, s, final, verdict, was, that, 14, quatrains, could, be, attributed, to, khayyam, with, certainty, various, tests, have, been, employed, to, reduce, the, quatrains, attributable, to, omar, to, about, 100, 434, arthur, christensen, states, that, of, more, than, 1, 200, ruba, is, known, to, be, ascribed, to, omar, only, 121, could, be, regarded, as, reasonably, authentic, 663, foroughi, accepts, 178, quatrains, as, authentic, while, ali, dashti, accepts, 36, of, them, 96, fitzgerald, s, source, was, transcripts, sent, to, him, in, 1856, 57, by, his, friend, and, teacher, edward, b, cowell, of, two, manuscripts, a, bodleian, manuscript, with, 158, quatrains, and, a, calcutta, manuscript, fitzgerald, completed, his, first, draft, in, 1857, and, sent, it, to, fraser, s, magazine, in, january, 1858, he, made, a, revised, draft, in, january, 1859, of, which, he, privately, printed, 250, copies, this, first, edition, became, extremely, sought, after, by, the, 1890s, when, more, than, two, million, copies, ha, been, sold, in, two, hundred, editions, the, extreme, popularity, of, fitzgerald, s, work, led, to, a, prolonged, debate, on, the, correct, interpretation, of, the, philosophy, behind, the, poems, fitzgerald, emphasized, the, religious, scepticism, he, found, in, omar, khayyam, in, his, preface, to, the, rub, iy, t, he, describes, omar, s, philosophy, as, epicurean, and, claims, that, omar, was, hated, and, dreaded, by, the, sufis, whose, practice, he, ridiculed, and, whose, faith, amounts, to, little, more, than, his, own, when, stripped, of, the, mysticism, and, formal, recognition, of, islamism, under, which, omar, would, not, hide, richard, nelson, frye, also, emphasizes, that, khayyam, was, despised, by, a, number, of, prominent, contemporary, sufis, these, include, figures, such, as, shams, tabrizi, najm, al, din, daya, al, ghazali, and, attar, who, viewed, khayyam, not, as, a, fellow, mystic, but, a, free, thinking, scientist, 663, 664, the, sceptic, interpretation, is, supported, by, the, medieval, historian, al, qifti, ca, 1172, 1248, who, in, his, the, history, of, learned, men, reports, that, omar, s, poems, were, only, outwardly, in, the, sufi, style, but, were, written, with, an, anti, religious, agenda, he, also, mentions, that, khayyam, was, indicted, for, impiety, and, went, on, a, pilgrimage, to, avoid, punishment, critics, of, fitzgerald, on, the, other, hand, have, accused, the, translator, of, misrepresenting, the, mysticism, of, sufi, poetry, by, an, overly, literal, interpretation, thus, the, view, of, omar, khayyam, as, a, sufi, was, defended, by, bjerregaard, 1915, dougan, 1991, likewise, says, that, attributing, hedonism, to, omar, is, due, to, the, failings, of, fitzgerald, s, translation, arguing, that, the, poetry, is, to, be, understood, as, deeply, esoteric, idries, shah, 1999, similarly, says, that, fitzgerald, misunderstood, omar, s, poetry, the, sufi, interpretation, is, the, view, of, a, minority, of, scholars, henry, beveridge, states, that, the, sufis, have, unaccountably, pressed, this, writer, into, their, service, they, explain, away, some, of, his, blasphemies, by, forced, interpretations, and, others, they, represent, as, innocent, freedoms, and, reproaches, aminrazavi, 2007, states, that, sufi, interpretation, of, khayyam, is, possible, only, by, reading, into, his, rubaiyat, extensively, and, by, stretching, the, content, to, fit, the, classical, sufi, doctrine, 128, fitzgerald, s, scepticist, reading, of, the, poetry, is, still, defended, by, modern, scholars, sadegh, hedayat, the, blind, owl, 1936, was, the, most, notable, modern, proponent, of, khayyam, s, philosophy, as, agnostic, scepticism, in, his, introductory, essay, to, his, second, edition, of, the, quatrains, of, the, philosopher, omar, khayyam, 1922, hedayat, states, that, while, khayyam, believes, in, the, transmutation, and, transformation, of, the, human, body, he, does, not, believe, in, a, separate, soul, if, we, are, lucky, our, bodily, particles, would, be, used, in, the, making, of, a, jug, of, wine, he, concludes, that, religion, has, proved, incapable, of, surmounting, his, inherent, fears, thus, khayyam, finds, himself, alone, and, insecure, in, a, universe, about, which, his, knowledge, is, nil, in, his, later, work, khayyam, s, quatrains, 1935, hedayat, further, maintains, that, khayyam, s, usage, of, sufic, terminology, such, as, wine, is, literal, and, that, khayyam, took, refuge, in, wine, to, ward, off, bitterness, and, to, blunt, the, cutting, edge, of, his, thoughts, fitzgerald, s, text, was, published, in, five, editions, with, substantial, revisions, of, the, five, editions, published, four, were, published, under, the, authorial, control, of, fitzgerald, the, fifth, edition, which, contained, only, minor, changes, from, the, fourth, was, edited, posthumously, on, the, basis, of, manuscript, revisions, fitzgerald, had, left, numerous, later, editions, were, published, after, 1889, notably, an, edition, with, illustrations, by, willy, pogany, first, published, in, 1909, george, g, harrap, london, it, was, issued, in, numerous, revised, editions, this, edition,

to, a, large, extent, the, rubaiyat, can, be, considered, original, poetry, by, fitzgerald, loosely, based, on, omar, s, quatrains, rather, than, a, translation, in, the, narrow, sense, fitzgerald,

to, describe, pious, hypocrites, as, a, maggot, minded, starved, fanatic, crew, rather, than, the, original, persian, which, emphasizes, their, ignorance, of, religion, rather, than, a, symbol, for,
