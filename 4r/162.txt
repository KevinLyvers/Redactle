of, cassio, and, desdemona, s, relationship, when, desdemona, drops, a, handkerchief, the, first, gift, given, to, her, by, othello, emilia, finds, it, and, gives, it, to, iago, at, his, request, unaware, of, what, he, plans, to, do, with, it, othello, appears, and, then, being, convinced, by, iago, of, his, wife, s, unfaithfulness, with, his, captain, vows, with, iago, for, the, death, of, desdemona, and, cassio, after, which, he, makes, iago, his, lieutenant, iago, plants, the, handkerchief, in, cassio, s, lodgings, then, tells, othello, to, watch, cassio, s, reactions, while, iago, questions, him, iago, goads, cassio, on, to, talk, about, his, affair, with, bianca, a, local, courtesan, but, whispers, her, name, so, quietly, that, othello, believes, the, two, men, are, talking,

exhorts, him, to, punish, iago, justly, he, then, denounces, iago, for, his, actions, and, leaves, to, tell, the, others, what, has, happened, shakespeare, s, primary, source, for, the, plot, was, the, story, of, a, moorish, captain, third, decade, story, seven, in, gli, hecatommithi, by, cinthio, giovanni, battista, giraldi, a, collection, of, one, hundred, novellas, about, love, grouped, into, ten, decades, by, theme, the, third, decade, deals, with, marital, infidelity, of, cinthio, s, characters, only, disdemona, the, equivalent, of, shakespeare, s, desdemona, her, name, means, ill, omened, in, italian, is, named, the, others, are, simply, called, the, moor, the, equivalent, of, othello, the, ensign, iago, the, corporal, cassio, and, similar, descriptions, in, its, story, the, ensign, falls, in, love, with, the, moor, s, wife, disdemona, but, her, indifference, turns, his, love, to, hate, and, in, revenge, he, persuades, the, moor, that, disdemona, has, been, unfaithful, the, moor, and, the, ensign, murder, disdemona, with, socks, filled, with, sand, and, bring, down, the, ceiling, of, her, bedchamber, to, make, it, appear, an, accident, the, story, continues, until, the, ensign, is, tortured, to, death, for, unrelated, reasons, and, the, moor, is, killed, by, disdemona, s, family, shakespeare, s, direct, sources, for, the, story, do, not, include, any, threat, of, warfare, it, seems, to, have, been, shakespeare, s, innovation, to, set, the, story, at, the, time, of, a, threatened, turkish, invasion, of, cyprus, apparently, fixing, it, in, the, events, of, 1570, those, historical, events, would, however, have, been, well, known, to, shakespeare, s, original, audience, who, would, therefore, have, been, aware, that, contrary, to, the, action, of, the, play, the, turks, took, cyprus, and, still, held, it, scholars, have, identified, many, other, influences, on, othello, things, which, are, not, themselves, sources, but, whose, impact, on, shakespeare, can, be, identified, in, the, play, these, include, virgil, s, aeneid, ovid, s, metamorphoses, both, the, merchant, s, tale, and, the, miller, s, tale, from, chaucer, s, the, canterbury, tales, geoffrey, fenton, s, certaine, tragicall, discourses, kyd, s, the, spanish, tragedy, george, peele, s, the, battle, of, alcazar, the, anonymous, arden, of, faversham, marlowe, s, doctor, faustus, and, heywood, s, a, woman, killed, with, kindness, these, also, include, shakespeare, s, own, earlier, plays, much, ado, about, nothing, in, which, a, similar, plot, was, used, in, a, comedy, the, merchant, of, venice, with, its, high, born, moorish, prince, of, morocco, and, titus, andronicus, in, which, a, moor, aaron, was, a, prominent, villain, and, as, such, was, a, forerunner, of, both, othello, and, iago, one, such, influence, is, not, a, literary, work, at, all, in, 1600, london, was, visited, for, half, a, year, by, the, moorish, ambassador, of, the, king, of, barbary, whose, entourage, caused, a, stir, in, the, city, shakespeare, s, company, is, known, to, have, played, at, court, during, the, time, of, the, visit, and, so, would, have, encountered, the, foreign, visitors, at, first, hand, among, shakespeare, s, non, fiction, or, partly, fictionalised, sources, were, gasparo, contarini, s, commonwealth, and, government, of, venice, and, leo, africanus, s, a, geographical, historie, of, africa, himself, a, moor, from, barbary, leo, said, of, his, own, people, they, are, so, credulous, they, will, beleeue, matters, impossible, which, are, told, them, and, no, nation, in, the, world, is, so, subject, vnto, iealousie, for, they, will, rather, their, liues, than, put, vp, any, disgrace, in, the, behalfe, of, their, women, both, traits, seen, in, shakespeare, s, othello, and, from, leo, s, own, life, story, shakespeare, took, a, well, born, educated, african, finding, a, place, at, the, height, of, a, white, european, power, from, philemon, holland, s, translation, of, pliny, s, natural, history, shakespeare, took, the, references, to, the, pontic, sea, to, arabian, trees, with, their, medicinable, gum, and, to, the, anthropophagi, and, men, whose, heads, do, grow, beneath, their, shoulders, elements, which, also, featured, in, the, fantastic, the, travels, of, sir, john, mandeville, the, terminus, ad, quem, for, othello, that, is, the, latest, year, in, which, the, play, could, have, been, written, is, 1604, since, a, performance, of, the, play, in, that, year, is, mentioned, in, the, accounts, book, of, sir, edmund, tilney, then, master, of, the, revels, a, terminus, a, quo, i, e, the, earliest, year, in, which, it, could, have, been, written, is, given, by, the, fact, that, one, of, its, sources, holland, s, translation, of, pliny, s, natural, history, was, published, in, 1601, within, this, range, scholars, have, tended, to, date, the, play, 1603, 1604, within, the, reign, of, james, i, since, the, play, appears, to, have, elements, designed, to, appeal, to, the, new, king, who, had, written, a, poem, about, the, defeat, of, the, turkish, navy, at, lepanto, and, to, the, new, queen, anne, of, denmark, in, whose, circle, there, was, an, interest, in, the, blackface, exoticism, also, reflected, in, ben, jonson, s, the, masque, of, blackness, in, which, the, queen, and, her, ladies, appeared, as, daughters, of, niger, that, dating, is, supported, by, similarities, to, measure, for, measure, another, of, shakespeare, s, plays, often, dated, around, 1604, and, which, like, othello, draws, its, plot, from, cinthio, s, gli, hecatommithi, this, date, is, also, supported, by, the, possibility, that, shakespeare, may, have, consulted, richard, knolles, 1603, the, generall, historie, of, the, turkes, however, evidence, of, an, earlier, date, 1601, 1602, is, provided, by, the, so, called, bad, quarto, of, shakespeare, s, play, hamlet, published, in, 1603, the, theory, is, that, the, bad, quarto, is, a, memorial, reconstruction, of, hamlet, made, by, some, of, its, actors, so, where, there, are, unintentional, echoes, of, othello, in, the, bad, quarto, for, example, to, my, vnfolding, lend, thy, listning, eare, in, the, bad, quarto, and, to, my, unfolding, lend, your, prosperous, ear, in, othello, and, a, number, of, others, it, suggests, that, the, actors, must, have, been, performing, othello, at, the, latest, in, the, season, preceding, the, bad, quarto, s, publication, othello, was, not, published, in, shakespeare, s, lifetime, the, first, published, version, of, the, play, was, a, quarto, in, 1622, usually, abbreviated, to, q, which, was, followed, a, year, later, by, the, play, s, appearance, in, the, first, folio, usually, abbreviated, to, f, there, are, significant, differences, between, the, two, early, editions, the, most, prominent, of, which, are, there, is, no, scholarly, consensus, to, account, for, the, differences, between, q, and, f, as, the, oxford, shakespeare, editor, michael, neill, summarises, things, the, textual, mystery, of, othello, is, unlikely, ever, to, be, resolved, to, general, satisfaction, o, beware, my, lord, of, jealousy, it, is, the, green, eyed, monster, which, doth, mock, the, meat, it, feeds, on, iago, the, influential, early, twentieth, century, shakespeare, critic, a, c, bradley, defined, othello, s, tragic, flaw, as, a, sexual, jealousy, so, intense, that, it, converts, human, nature, into, chaos, and, liberates, the, beast, in, man, the, animal, in, man, forcing, itself, into, his, consciousness, in, naked, grossness, and, he, writhing, before, it, but, powerless, to, deny, it, entrance, grasping, inarticulate, images, of, pollution, and, finding, relief, only, in, a, bestial, thirst, for, blood, this, jealousy, is, symbolized, in, the, play, through, animal, imagery, in, the, early, acts, of, the, play, it, is, iago, who, mentions, ass, daws, flies, ram, jennet, guinea, hen, baboon, wild, cat, snipe, monkeys, monster, and, wolves, but, from, the, third, act, onwards, othello, catches, this, line, of, imagery, from, iago, as, his, irrational, jealousy, takes, hold, the, same, occurs, with, diabolical, imagery, i, e, images, of, hell, and, devils, of, which, iago, uses, 14, of, his, 16, diabolical, images, in, the, first, two, acts, yet, othello, uses, 25, of, his, 26, in, the, last, three, acts, not, only, othello, but, also, iago, is, consumed, by, jealousy, his, is, a, kind, of, envy, which, contemporary, scholar, francis, bacon, called, the, vilest, affection, and, the, most, depraved, for, which, cause, it, is, the, proper, attribute, of, the, devil, as, it, always, cometh, to, pass, that, envy, worketh, subtilly, and, in, the, dark, and, to, the, prejudice, of, good, things, sometimes, critics, have, struggled, to, define, the, kind, of, jealousy, othello, suffers, or, to, deny, it, as, a, motive, for, example, those, who, claim, that, in, russia, between, 1945, and, 1957, only, one, actor, portrayed, othello, as, obsessed, by, jealousy, in, fact, jealousy, is, a, wide, ranging, emotion, and, encompasses, the, spectrum, from, lust, to, spiritual, disillusionment, within, which, othello, s, obsession, must, fall, and, he, displays, many, accepted, aspects, of, jealousy, an, eagerness, to, snatch, at, proofs, indulging, degrading, images, of, the, jealousy, s, object, snatching, at, ambiguities, to, ease, the, mind, dread, of, vulgar, ridicule, and, a, spirit, of, vindictiveness, ultimately, othello, becomes, persuaded, that, his, honour, is, tarnished, by, his, wife, s, unfaithfulness, and, can, only, be, restored, through, desdemona, s, and, cassio, s, deaths, and, this, a, code, of, behaviour, no, longer, considered, valid, is, one, reason, why, modern, critics, rarely, regard, othello, among, shakespeare, s, greatest, tragedies, as, ben, okri, has, said, if, othello, did, not, begin, as, a, play, about, race, then, its, history, has, made, it, one, or, as, the, oxford, editor, professor, michael, neill, summarises, it, anxieties, about, the, treatment, of, race, in, othello, are, a, recurrent, feature, of, both, its, critical, and, performance, histories, where, they, once, focused, on, the, supposed, scandal, of, miscegenation, they, are, nowadays, more, likely, to, address, the, play, s, complicity, in, racial, stereotyping, in, plot, terms, othello, s, race, serves, to, mark, him, as, other, as, both, a, christian, and, a, black, african, othello, is, as, scholar, tom, mcalindon, puts, it, both, of, and, not, of, venice, and, actor, paul, robeson, considered, othello, s, colour, as, essentially, secondary, as, a, way, of, emphasizing, his, cultural, difference, and, consequent, vulnerability, in, a, society, he, does, not, fully, understand, in, the, world, of, the, play, itself, jyotsna, singh, argues, that, brabantio, s, and, others, objection, to, othello, a, decorated, and, respected, general, as, a, suitable, husband, for, desdemona, a, senator, s, daughter, only, makes, sense, in, racist, terms, reinforced, by, the, bestial, imagery, used, by, iago, in, delivering, the, news, the, racist, slurs, used, by, iago, roderigo, and, brabantio, in, the, play, suggest, that, shakespeare, conceived, of, othello, as, a, black, african, thicklips, an, old, black, ram, is, tupping, your, white, ewe, you, ll, have, your, daughter, covered, with, a, barbary, horse, the, sooty, bosom, of, such, a, thing, as, thou, as, do, things, othello, says, of, himself, haply, for, i, am, black, or, begrimed, and, black, as, mine, own, face, there, is, critical, divide, over, othello, s, ethnic, origin, a, moor, broadly, refers, to, someone, from, northwest, africa, especially, if, muslim, but, in, shakespeare, s, england, moor, was, used, with, broader, connotations, sometimes, referring, to, africans, of, all, regions, sometimes, to, arabic, or, islamic, peoples, beyond, africa, such, as, those, of, turkey, and, the, middle, east, and, sometimes, to, muslims, of, any, race, or, location, i, think, this, play, is, racist, and, i, think, it, is, not, scholar, virginia, vaughan, in, shakespeare, s, main, source, cinthio, s, gli, hecatommithi, the, character, disdemona, the, equivalent, of, shakespeare, s, desdemona, says, i, know, not, what, to, say, of, the, moor, he, used, to, be, all, love, towards, me, but, within, these, few, days, he, has, become, another, man, and, much, i, fear, that, i, shall, prove, a, warning, to, young, girls, not, to, marry, against, the, wishes, of, their, parents, and, that, the, italian, ladies, may, learn, from, me, not, to, wed, a, man, whose, nature, and, habitude, of, life, estrange, from, us, similar, wording, was, used, in, one, of, the, earliest, and, most, negative, critiques, of, the, play, thomas, rymer, writing, in, his, 1693, a, short, view, of, tragedy, suggested, that, one, of, the, play, s, morals, was, a, caution, to, all, maidens, of, quality, how, without, their, parents, consent, they, run, away, with, blackamoors, rymer, however, dryly, observed, that, another, such, moral, might, be, a, warning, to, all, good, wives, that, they, look, well, to, their, linnen, as, such, his, comments, should, be, read, within, the, context, of, his, overarching, criticism, of, the, play, as, unrealistic, and, lacking, in, obvious, moral, conclusions, for, this, noble, lady, who, regarded, the, mind, more, than, the, features, of, men, with, a, singularity, rather, to, be, admired, than, imitated, had, chosen, for, the, object, of, her, affections, a, moor, a, black, othello, in, tales, from, shakespeare, 1807, by, charles, and, mary, lamb, in, the, nineteenth, century, such, well, known, writers, as, samuel, taylor, coleridge, and, charles, lamb, questioned, whether, the, play, could, even, be, called, a, true, tragedy, when, it, dramatized, the, inviolable, taboo, of, a, white, woman, in, a, relationship, with, a, black, man, coleridge, writing, in, 1818, argued, that, othello, could, not, have, been, conceived, as, black, can, we, imagine, so, utterly, ignorant, as, to, make, a, barbarous, negro, plead, royal, birth, at, a, time, too, when, negroes, were, not, known, except, as, slaves, and, most, surely, as, an, english, audience, was, disposed, at, the, beginning, of, the, seventeenth, century, it, would, be, something, monstrous, to, conceive, this, beautiful, venetian, girl, falling, in, love, with, a, veritable, negro, it, would, argue, a, disproportionateness, a, want, of, balance, in, desdemona, which, shakespeare, does, not, appear, to, have, in, the, least, contemplated, significant, critical, attention, has, been, devoted, to, the, matter, notably, coleridge, controversially, stated, in, his, notes, that, it, would, be, something, monstrous, to, conceive, this, beautiful, venetian, girl, falling, in, love, with, a, veritable, negro, m, r, ridley, s, introduction, to, the, infamous, 1958, arden, shakespeare, second, edition, has, been, heavily, criticsed, for, his, anecdotes, in, an, apparent, defence, of, othello, as, a, black, man, in, opposition, to, coleridge, to, a, great, many, people, the, word, negro, suggests, at, once, the, picture, of, what, they, would, call, a, nigger, the, woolly, hair, thick, lips, round, skull, blunt, features, and, burnt, cork, blackness, of, the, traditional, nigger, minstrel, there, are, more, races, than, one, in, africa, and, that, a, man, is, black, in, colour, is, no, reason, why, he, should, even, to, european, eyes, look, subhuman, one, of, the, finest, heads, i, have, ever, seen, on, any, human, being, was, that, of, a, negro, conductor, on, an, american, pullman, car, he, was, coal, black, but, he, might, have, sat, to, a, sculptor, for, a, statue, of, caesar, martin, orkin, described, ridley, s, comments, as, a, particular, strain, of, racism, with, his, attempt, to, dismiss, the, arguments, of, others, instead, helping, to, indicate, the, flavour, of, his, own, attitudes, additional, criticism, was, directed, at, the, arden, 2, edition, being, the, predominant, text, in, south, africa, with, orkin, aruging, that, the, introduction, s, racist, undertones, supported, the, regime, s, educative, goals, karen, newman, sharply, criticises, ridley, s, assumption, that, a, great, many, people, assume, his, claims, and, censures, his, defence, of, the, ability, for, a, black, person, to, not, look, subhuman, involving, the, projection, of,

these, sentiments, were, instrumental, in, ushering, in, the, so, called, bronze, age, of, othello, discussed, further, under, 19th, century, below, martin, orkin, s, 1987, essay, othello, and, the, plain, face, of, racism, acknowledges, the, racist, sentiments, in, the, play, but, vindicates, shakespeare, who, confines, these, views, to, discredited, characters, such, as, iago, roderigo, and, brabantio, he, concludes, that, in, its, fine, scrutiny, of, the, mechanisms, underlying, iago, s, use, of, racism, and, in, its, rejection, of, human, pigmentation, as, a, means, of, identifying, human, worth, the, play, as, it, always, has, done, continues, to, oppose, racism, the, critical, approach, to, racial, issues, in, the, play, changed, direction, with, the, publication, in, 1996, by, howard, university, press, of, othello, new, essays, by, black, writers, edited, by, mythili, kaul, which, made, clear, that, black, readers, and, audience, members, may, be, experiencing, a, different, play, from, white, ones, questions, about, whether, othello, is, among, shakespeare, s, greatest, plays, are, rendered, irrelevant, in, the, context, of, discussions, about, how, the, play, illuminates, the, racial, thinking, of, shakespeare, s, time, and, of, the, present, day, the, nigerian, poet, ben, okri, in, his, 1997, a, way, of, being, free, included, several, meditations, on, othello, arguing, that, because, it, is, possible, that, othello, actually, is, a, blackened, white, man, he, is, not, a, fully, formed, character, with, a, psychology, but, a, white, myth, or, stereotype, of, black, masculinity, even, with, that, knowledge, okri, writes, the, black, person, s, response, to, othello, is, more, secret, and, much, more, anguished, than, can, be, imagined, it, makes, you, unbearably, lonely, to, know, that, you, can, empathise, with, but, they, will, rarely, empathise, with, you, it, hurts, to, watch, othello, from, the, 1980s, othello, became, a, role, that, only, black, actors, performed, however, in, 1998, black, actor, hugh, quarshie, questioned, whether, the, central, role, in, othello, should, be, played, by, a, black, actor, saying, if, a, black, actor, plays, a, role, written, for, a, white, actor, does, he, not, risk, making, racial, stereotypes, seem, legitimate, and, even, true, does, he, not, encourage, the, white, way, or, rather, the, wrong, way, of, looking, at, black, men, namely, that, are, over, emotional, excitable, and, unstable, scholar, virginia, vaughan, made, a, related, point, in, 2005, the, danger, of, a, black, actor, in, the, title, role, is, that, with, the, loss, of, the, reminders, that, this, is, not, real, but, an, impersonation, the, enactment, of, othello, s, jealous, rage, and, murder, of, his, wife, can, strike, audiences, as, the, embodiment, of, their, own, stereotypes, of, black, pathology, rather, than, an, actorly, performance, at, brabantio, s, first, appearance, towards, the, end, of, the, first, scene, he, asks, whether, sinister, charms, may, have, abused, the, property, of, youth, and, maidenhood, of, desdemona, for, him, desdemona, denying, her, father, s, right, to, choose, her, husband, and, choosing, a, black, man, for, herself, can, only, be, explained, by, black, magic, the, notion, of, women, as, property, pervades, the, play, even, after, her, death, othello, says, of, desdemona, had, she, been, true, if, heaven, would, make, me, such, another, world, of, one, entire, and, perfect, chrysolite, i, d, not, have, sold, her, for, it, also, pervasive, is, the, male, fear, of, female, sexuality, the, word, whore, appears, 14, times, in, othello, more, often, than, in, any, other, work, by, shakespeare, often, used, in, kay, stanton, s, words, as, a, male, initiated, inscription, onto, the, female, as, scapegoat, and, it, is, one, of, only, two, of, the, plays, alongside, timon, of, athens, in, which, the, word, whore, is, used, with, specific, reference, to, every, named, female, character, in, the, world, of, the, play, whorishness, is, understood, as, the, true, and, essential, nature, of, women, yet, this, is, constantly, shown, to, be, a, projection, of, male, imaginations, completely, unrelated, to, the, women, s, perceptions, of, themselves, or, to, their, behavior, towards, the, end, of, the, play, desdemona, s, goodness, increasingly, becomes, represented, by, long, suffering, martyrdom, perceived, as, a, longstanding, sign, of, acceptable, femininity, in, place, of, the, headstrong, heroine, of, the, opening, acts, desdemona, increasingly, stripped, of, agency, endures, her, husband, s, anger, and, humiliations, even, his, striking, her, in, public, and, eventually, while, dying, tries, to, exonerate, him, for, his, murder, of, her, others, perceive, desdemona, s, reaction, as, one, of, strength, and, dignity, not, passivity, in, contrast, emilia, the, only, real, grown, up, in, the, play, in, the, words, of, stage, director, michael, attenborough, revolts, against, misogyny, defying, her, husband, iago, s, demands, three, times, in, the, final, scene, the, over, reliance, of, the, plot, of, othello, upon, a, trivial, prop, the, handkerchief, was, noted, in, the, play, s, earliest, criticism, the, same, thomas, rymer, quoted, above, in, his, 1693, a, short, view, of, tragedy, suggested, that, the, play, should, better, have, been, called, the, tragedy, of, the, handkerchief, arguing, the, handkerchief, is, so, remote, a, trifle, no, booby, on, this, side, mauritania, could, make, any, consequence, from, it, in, spite, of, othello, s, protestations, in, the, first, act, that, no, magic, was, used, in, his, wooing, of, desdemona, he, later, claims, magical, properties, for, the, handkerchief, his, first, gift, to, her, a, question, which, has, interested, critics, is, whether, he, himself, believes, these, stories, or, is, using, them, to, pressure, or, test, desdemona, there, is, certainly, a, contradiction, between, othello, s, assertion, linked, to, its, supposed, magical, properties, that, his, mother, received, the, handkerchief, from, an, egyptian, charmer, in, act, 3, scene, 4, and, his, later, assertion, that, his, father, gave, it, to, his, mother, made, in, act, 4, scene, 2, are, we, the, audience, intended, to, believe, in, the, handkerchief, s, magical, properties, the, handkerchief, provides, many, examples, of, how, chance, operates, in, support, of, iago, s, plots, desdemona, loses, it, just, when, iago, is, in, need, of, evidence, of, the, invented, affair, cassio, fails, to, recognise, that, it, is, hers, cassio, gives, it, to, bianca, to, copy, who, throws, it, back, at, him, at, the, very, moment, when, othello, is, eavesdropping, symbolically, the, handkerchief, represents, the, bond, between, othello, and, desdemona, and, its, loss, the, breaking, of, that, bond, othello, blames, desdemona, for, its, loss, when, in, fact, he, casts, it, aside, while, she, is, trying, to, use, it, to, help, him, the, whiteness, of, the, handkerchief, is, often, taken, to, represent, desdemona, s, purity, and, the, red, strawberries, blood, from, her, hymen, symbolising, her, virgin, marriage, in, contrast, professor, ian, smith, argues, that, a, handkerchief, dyed, in, mummy, would, not, be, white, but, black, and, therefore, symbolic, of, othello, in, a, 1997, production, at, the, royal, national, theatre, the, handkerchief, fell, to, the, ground, immediately, before, the, interval, and, remained, onstage, throughout, it, as, if, as, the, reviewer, richard, butler, put, it, challenging, one, of, us, to, pick, it, up, and, prevent, a, tragedy, othello, and, iago, are, two, of, the, five, longest, parts, in, the, shakespeare, canon, at, 1097, lines, iago, s, is, the, larger, of, the, two, only, hamlet, in, hamlet, and, richard, in, richard, iii, are, longer, othello, although, a, tragedy, takes, elements, from, other, genres, including, comedy, for, example, there, are, similarities, between, egeus, complaint, about, his, daughter, hermia, s, lover, lysander, in, the, first, act, of, shakespeare, s, a, midsummer, night, s, dream, with, cunning, hast, thou, filched, my, daughter, s, heart, turned, her, obedience, which, is, due, to, me, to, stubborn, harshness, and, brabantio, s, complaint, to, the, duke, in, act, 1, of, othello, in, which, he, asks, desdemona, do, you, perceive, in, all, this, noble, company, where, most, you, owe, obedience, the, word, honest, is, used, more, than, 40, times, in, the, play, sometimes, with, reference, to, desdemona, s, chastity, but, in, almost, all, other, cases, with, reference, to, iago, where, it, has, a, double, meaning, as, a, condescending, term, for, a, social, inferior, and, as, a, reference, to, his, supposed, truthfulness, iago, s, role, is, in, robert, watson, s, words, overdetermined, in, renaissance, dramatic, convention, he, is, partly, the, scheming, machiavel, of, renaissance, tragedy, partly, the, vengeful, malcontent, of, revenge, tragedy, partly, the, instigator, of, jealousy, in, domestic, tragedy, and, partly, the, devil, incarnate, of, morality, plays, the, character, s, own, motives, are, never, made, clear, because, iago, himself, expresses, too, many, motives, these, led, samuel, taylor, coleridge, to, refer, to, iago, s, motive, hunting, of, motive, less, malignity, some, critics, have, suggested, other, motives, psychologist, ernest, jones, s, suggestion, that, iago, may, be, motivated, by, a, repressed, homosexual, desire, for, othello, has, been, influential, in, subsequent, performances, of, the, role, as, robert, watson, summarises, it, the, seemingly, endless, critical, debate, about, iago, s, motivation, reflects, a, truth, rather, than, a, confusion, about, the, play, if, it, is, disturbing, to, suspect, that, a, devil, may, be, lurking, around, us, in, human, form, perhaps, within, our, most, trusted, friend, it, is, even, more, disturbing, to, realize, that, this, devil, may, be, a, reflection, of, our, own, destructive, tendencies, ultimately, iago, provides, no, answer, refusing, at, the, end, of, the, play, to, reveal, his, motive, demand, me, nothing, what, you, know, you, know, from, this, time, forth, i, never, will, speak, word, othello, has, a, double, time, scheme, meaning, that, the, timeframe, of, the, play, does, not, contain, enough, time, for, its, action, its, action, is, continuous, from, othello, and, desdemona, s, wedding, night, except, for, the, voyage, from, venice, to, cyprus, during, which, cassio, and, desdemona, are, not, together, and, the, time, in, cyprus, covers, an, estimated, 33, hours, yet, this, short, timeframe, does, not, allow, any, time, for, the, supposed, affair, between, desdemona, and, cassio, to, have, happened, in, support, of, the, short, time, scheme, is, the, continuous, nature, of, the, action, the, fleet, arrives, in, cyprus, in, the, afternoon, and, the, plot, against, cassio, proceeds, that, evening, into, the, early, morning, cassio, resolves, to, seek, desdemona, s, help, the, following, morning, and, does, so, commencing, the, long, temptation, scene, by, the, end, of, which, othello, has, resolved, to, kill, desdemona, and, has, ordered, iago, to, attempt, to, kill, cassio, all, of, which, happens, that, same, night, and, this, urgency, is, underlined, by, the, text, in, particular, s, iago, s, concern, that, if, othello, compares, notes, with, anyone, else, it, will, become, clear, that, iago, is, playing, one, character, against, another, but, there, is, also, a, long, time, scheme, iago, persuades, othello, that, desdemona, and, cassio, have, the, act, of, shame, a, thousand, times, committed, emilia, says, iago, hath, a, hundred, times, asked, her, to, steal, the, handkerchief, bianca, complains, cassio, has, been, away, from, her, a, week, news, of, the, turkish, defeat, needs, time, to, reach, venice, then, lodovico, needs, time, to, reach, cyprus, and, by, act, 4, roderigo, who, sold, all, his, land, at, the, end, of, act, 1, has, already, squandered, all, his, money, shakespeare, s, source, story, in, cinthio, takes, place, entirely, in, the, long, time, scheme, shakespeare, appears, to, have, introduced, the, shorter, time, scheme, to, increase, dramatic, tension, while, also, introducing, moments, where, iago, s, plot, could, fall, apart, for, example, if, emilia, had, given, an, honest, answer, to, desdemona, s, where, should, i, lose, that, handkerchief, or, if, roderigo, had, chosen, to, denounce, iago, the, discovery, of, a, double, time, scheme, has, been, ascribed, to, articles, written, by, john, wilson, in, blackwood, s, magazine, in, 1849, and, 1850, although, references, to, the, problem, predate, that, the, whole, question, is, sometimes, rejected, as, academic, nit, picking, director, michael, attenborough, asked, about, it, in, an, interview, replied, i, strongly, suspect, shakespeare, didn, t, think, about, it, very, much, and, as, michael, neill, points, out, many, of, the, problems, disappear, if, one, supposes, that, othello, believed, cassio, and, desdemona, s, affair, had, commenced, prior, to, othello, and, desdemona, s, elopement, neill, summarises, the, issue, as, no, more, than, a, particularly, striking, side, effect, of, the, general, indifference, to, naturalistic, handling, of, time, and, space, that, shakespeare, shared, with, other, dramatists, of, the, period, othello, was, written, for, and, performed, by, the, king, s, men, the, playing, company, to, which, shakespeare, belonged, and, the, 1622, quarto, notes, on, its, title, page, that, the, play, was, diuerse, times, acted, at, the, globe, and, at, black, friers, by, his, maiesties, seruants, these, two, theatres, had, very, different, features, the, former, a, large, outdoor, theatre, accommodating, an, audience, of, 3, 000, the, latter, a, private, indoor, theatre, that, sat, around, 700, paying, higher, prices, and, the, style, of, playing, would, have, adapted, to, these, different, conditions, the, play, was, performed, at, court, by, the, king, s, men, on, 1, november, 1604, and, again, in, 1612, 13, as, part, of, the, celebrations, for, the, wedding, of, princess, elizabeth, and, frederick, v, of, the, palatinate, the, title, role, was, originally, played, by, richard, burbage, whose, eulogies, reveal, that, he, was, admired, in, the, role, moorish, characters, were, conventionally, played, in, turbans, with, long, white, gowns, and, red, trousers, with, the, actor, s, face, darkened, with, lampblack, or, coal, the, original, iago, was, likely, john, lowin, all, theatres, were, closed, down, by, the, puritan, government, on, 6, september, 1642, upon, the, restoration, of, the, monarchy, in, 1660, two, patent, companies, the, king, s, company, and, the, duke, s, company, were, established, and, the, existing, theatrical, repertoire, divided, between, them, othello, being, allocated, to, the, king, s, company, s, repertoire, these, patents, stated, that, all, the, women, s, parts, to, be, acted, in, either, of, the, said, two, companies, for, the, time, to, come, may, be, performed, by, women, the, first, professional, acting, appearance, by, a, woman, on, the, english, stage, was, that, of, desdemona, in, othello, on, 8, december, 1660, although, history, does, not, record, who, took, the, role, margaret, hughes, is, the, first, woman, known, to, have, played, desdemona, in, restoration, theatres, it, was, common, for, shakespeare, s, plays, to, be, adapted, or, rewritten, othello, was, not, adapted, in, this, way, although, it, has, often, been, cut, to, conform, to, current, ideas, of, decorum, or, refinement, these, cuts, were, not, limited, to, removing, violent, religious, or, sexual, content, but, extended, on, different, occasions, to, removing, references, to, eavesdropping, to, othello, s, fit, to, othello, s, tears, to, the, first, 200, lines, of, the, fourth, act, or, to, the, entire, role, of, bianca, among, seventeenth, and, eighteenth, century, actors, praised, for, expressing, the, nobility, of, the, moor, and, fully, exploring, the, degrading, passions, which, lead, to, the, brutal, murder, he, commits, were, thomas, betterton, and, spranger, barry, a, review, of, the, latter, by, john, bernard, expressed, how, barry, s, othello, looked, a, few, seconds, in, desdemona, s, face, as, if, to, read, her, feelings, and, disprove, his, suspicions, then, turning, away, as, the, adverse, conviction, gathered, in, his, heart, he, spoke, falteringly, and, gushed, into, tears, the, first, professional, performances, of, the, play, in, north, america, are, likely, to, have, been, those, of, the, hallam, company, robert, upton, william, hallam, s, advance, man, performed, othello, at, a, makeshift, theatre, in, new, york, on, 26, december, 1751, and, religious, objections, to, theatre, led, the, hallam, company, to, perform, othello, as, a, series, of, moral, dialogues, at, rhode, island, in, 1761, although, not, performed, in, portugal, until, the, nineteenth, century, the, play, holds, of, the, distinction, of, being, the, first, of, shakespeare, s, works, to, have, reached, a, portuguese, speaking, country, possibly, at, the, request, of, a, portuguese, reader, in, 1765, paul, robeson, s, iconic, performance, see, 20th, century, below, was, not, the, first, professional, performance, of, the, title, role, by, a, black, actor, the, first, known, is, james, hewlett, at, the, african, grove, theatre, new, york, in, 1822, and, hewlett, s, prot, g, ira, aldridge, billed, as, the, african, roscius, played, many, shakespearean, roles, across, europe, for, forty, years, including, othello, at, the, royalty, theatre, london, in, 1825, there, are, stories, of, extravagant, audience, reactions, to, the, play, one, of, the, most, extreme, is, related, by, french, novelist, stendhal, who, reports, that, at, the, baltimore, theatre, in, 1822, a, soldier, interrupted, the, performance, just, before, desdemona, s, murder, shouting, it, will, never, be, said, that, in, my, presence, a, confounded, negro, has, killed, a, white, woman, the, soldier, fired, his, gun, breaking, the, arm, of, the, actor, playing, othello, throughout, the, eighteenth, and, nineteenth, centuries, othello, was, regarded, as, the, most, demanding, of, shakespeare, s, roles, it, is, considered, a, part, of, theatre, legend, that, edmund, kean, collapsed, while, playing, the, role, and, died, two, months, after, leigh, hunt, saw, kean, s, othello, in, 1819, describing, his, performance, in, the, examiner, as, the, masterpiece, of, the, living, stage, before, kean, the, leading, exponent, of, the, role, had, been, john, philip, kemble, who, played, a, neoclassical, hero, in, contrast, kean, presented, othello, as, a, man, of, romantic, temperament, and, uncontrollable, passion, it, was, also, kean, who, initiated, the, so, called, bronze, age, of, othello, by, insisting, that, it, was, a, gross, error, to, make, othello, either, a, negro, or, a, black, and, thereby, commencing, a, stage, tradition, of, using, lighter, makeup, rather, than, blackface, an, advantage, of, this, change, was, that, the, actor, s, facial, expressions, could, be, more, clearly, seen, critics, have, naturally, focused, on, the, two, central, male, roles, but, emilia, becomes, a, powerful, role, in, the, final, act, indeed, charlotte, cushman, s, emilia, was, said, to, upstage, edwin, forrest, s, othello, in, 1845, and, when, fanny, kemble, played, desdemona, in, 1848, she, changed, the, performance, tradition, previously, desdemonas, had, in, her, words, always, appeared, to, me, to, acquiesce, with, wonderful, equanimity, in, their, assassination, but, kemble, a, passionate, feminist, and, abolitionist, decided, i, shall, make, a, desperate, fight, for, it, for, i, feel, horribly, at, the, idea, of, being, murdered, in, my, bed, in, 1848, othello, was, produced, by, barry, lewis, at, the, sans, souci, theatre, in, calcutta, the, casting, of, the, white, mrs, anderson, opposite, the, dark, skinned, indian, baishnav, charan, auddy, led, to, controversy, to, polarized, reviews, and, to, a, fiasco, on, the, opening, night, when, half, of, the, cast, military, men, were, prohibited, from, leaving, barracks, by, order, of, the, brigadier, of, dum, dum, for, tommaso, salvini, and, edwin, booth, the, role, of, othello, was, a, career, length, project, salvini, always, played, the, role, in, italian, even, when, acting, alongside, a, company, performing, in, english, his, conception, of, the, role, was, of, a, barbarian, with, savage, and, passionate, instincts, concealed, by, a, thick, veneer, of, civilisation, konstantin, stanislavski, admired, and, was, greatly, influenced, by, salvini, s, othello, which, he, saw, in, 1882, in, my, life, in, art, stanislavski, recalls, salvini, s, scene, before, the, senate, saying, that, the, actor, grasped, all, of, us, in, his, palm, and, held, us, there, as, if, we, were, ants, or, flies, booth, in, complete, contrast, played, othello, as, a, restrained, gentleman, when, ellen, terry, played, desdemona, she, commented, on, how, much, booth, s, style, helped, her, it, is, difficult, to, preserve, the, simple, heroic, blindness, of, desdemona, to, the, fact, that, her, lord, mistrusts, her, if, her, lord, is, raving, and, stamping, under, her, nose, booth, was, gentle, with, desdemona, booth, was, also, an, acclaimed, iago, and, his, advice, to, actors, of, the, role, was, to, portray, iago, properly, you, must, seem, to, be, what, all, the, characters, think, and, say, you, are, not, what, the, spectators, know, you, to, be, try, to, win, even, them, by, your, sincerity, don, t, act, the, villain, stanislavski, himself, first, played, othello, in, 1896, he, was, dissatisfied, with, his, own, performance, later, recalling, i, was, able, to, reach, nothing, more, than, insane, strain, spiritual, and, physical, impotence, and, the, squeezing, of, tragic, emotion, out, of, myself, othello, was, performed, in, the, shimpa, style, in, japan, in, 1903, by, otojiro, kawakami, resetting, the, location, cyprus, to, taiwan, which, was, then, a, japanese, colony, in, 1930, stanislavski, directed, a, production, of, othello, for, the, moscow, art, theatre, which, was, influential, in, the, development, of, his, system, the, performance, was, directed, remotely, by, letter, while, stanislavski, recovered, from, illness, in, france, the, most, significant, theatre, production, in, wartime, america, featured, paul, robeson, as, othello, robeson, had, previously, played, the, role, in, london, in, 1930, with, a, cast, including, peggy, ashcroft, sybil, thorndike, and, ralph, richardson, and, would, later, take, the, role, for, the, rsc, in, 1959, at, stratford, upon, avon, margaret, webster, s, 1943, broadway, production, was, considered, a, theatrical, landmark, with, robeson, in, the, words, of, howard, barnes, making, the, moor, the, great, and, terrible, figure, of, tragedy, which, he, has, so, rarely, been, on, the,

static, and, declamatory, style, when, janet, suzman, directed, the, play, in, south, africa, during, apartheid, in, 1988, the, performance, was, passionately, politicised, with, the, racism, of, several, characters, and, especially, iago, modelled, on, eug, ne, terre, blanche, foregrounded, the, play, was, highly, controversial, the, physical, contact, between, the, black, john, kani, and, the, white, joanna, weinburg, provoking, walk, outs, and, a, pile, up, of, hate, mail, white, actors, continued, to, dominate, the, role, until, the, 1980s, willard, white, in, 1989, was, the, first, black, actor, to, play, othello, at, stratford, since, paul, robeson, thirty, years, earlier, a, singular, and, idiosyncratic, performance, of, a, white, actor, in, the, central, role, was, jude, kelly, s, photonegative, production, for, the, shakespeare, theatre, company, in, washington, d, c, in, 1997, in, which, patrick, stewart, played, othello, as, white, while, almost, all, other, speaking, parts, were, played, by, actors, of, african, descent, the, script, remained, unchanged, as, regards, the, character, s, race, so, the, white, othello, was, throughout, referred, to, as, black, at, the, turn, of, the, century, performances, at, the, rsc, were, dominated, by, their, iagos, richard, mccabe, followed, simon, russell, beale, in, portraying, misogynistic, embittered, ncos,

christchurch, new, zealand, made, effective, use, of, a, trope, which, had, had, racist, overtones, when, used, by, earlier, european, directors, of, othello, reverting, to, his, native, culture, setting, the, action, in, the, waikato, land, wars, othello, was, a, british, adopted, general, leading, forces, against, his, own, people, until, finally, bursting, into, a, terrifying, wero, a, warrior, s, challenge, before, exacting, his, revenge, on, desdemona, a, radically, different, approach, was, taken, in, jette, steckel, s, 2009, german, language, production, for, the, deutsches, theater, berlin, although, the, translation, consistently, used, the, word, schwarze, for, moor, in, the, original, othello, was, played, by, the, white, german, actress, susanne, wolff, in, a, range, of, different, costumes, and, disguises, including, a, gorilla, suit, for, part, of, act, 4, creating, a, performance, in, which, everything, is, in, ayanna, thompson, s, words, conveyed, through, representational, metaphors, which, render, othello, s, race, less, of, a, stable, physical, marker, and, more, of, a, fractured, and, performative, one, a, common, theme, of, modern, productions, of, the, play, is, an, emphasis, on, military, life, when, adrian, lester, played, the, role, in, nicholas, hytner, s, 2013, national, theatre, production, a, retired, army, veteran, was, employed, to, teach, the, cast, about, ranks, comportment, and, off, duty, behaviours, another, 21st, century, trend, exemplified, by, that, performance, is, to, reduce, the, focus, of, the, play, on, othello, s, race, by, having, other, parts, played, by, actors, of, colour, also, and, a, third, is, an, increasing, focus, on, desdemona, s, youth, and, innocence, at, the, expense, of, her, strength, of, character, in, 21st, century, productions, more, emphasis, has, been, given, to, the, theme, of, domestic, violence, othello, s, difference, has, been, tested, in, ways, other, than, race, a, rare, example, is, stein, winge, s, 2015, casting, of, a, white, american, actor, bill, pullman, as, an, american, navy, man, adrift, in, norway, the, play, has, provided, opportunities, for, breakout,
