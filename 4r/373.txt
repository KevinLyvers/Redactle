classical, music, canon, and, is, widely, studied, performed, and, listened, to, the, term, baroque, comes, from, the, portuguese, word, barroco, meaning, misshapen, pearl, the, works, of, antonio, vivaldi, george, frideric, handel, and, johann, sebastian, bach, are, considered, the, pinnacle, of, the, baroque, period, other, key, composers, of, the, baroque, era, include, claudio, monteverdi, domenico, scarlatti, alessandro, scarlatti, alessandro, stradella, tomaso, albinoni, johann, pachelbel, henry, purcell, georg, philipp, telemann, jean, baptiste, lully, jean, philippe, rameau, marc,

seixas, adam, jarz, bski, and, others, with, giovanni, battista, pergolesi, being, the, most, prominent, baroque, composer, of, sacred, music, the, baroque, saw, the, creation, of, common, practice, tonality, an, approach, to, writing, music, in, which, a, song, or, piece, is, written, in, a, particular, key, this, type, of, harmony, has, continued, to, be, used, extensively, in, western, classical, and, popular, music, during, the, baroque, era, professional, musicians, were, expected, to, be, accomplished, improvisers, of, both, solo, melodic, lines, and, accompaniment, parts, baroque, concerts, were, typically, accompanied, by, a, basso, continuo, group, comprising, chord, playing, instrumentalists, such, as, harpsichordists, and, lute, players, improvising, chords, from, a, figured, bass, part, while, a, group, of, bass, instruments, viol, cello, double, bass, played, the, bassline, a, characteristic, baroque, form, was, the, dance, suite, while, the, pieces, in, a, dance, suite, were, inspired, by, actual, dance, music, dance, suites, were, designed, purely, for, listening, not, for, accompanying, dancers, during, the, period, composers, experimented, with, finding, a, fuller, sound, for, each, instrumental, part, thus, creating, the, orchestra, made, changes, in, musical, notation, the, development, of, figured, bass, as, a, quick, way, to, notate, the, chord, progression, of, a, song, or, piece, and, developed, new, instrumental, playing, techniques, baroque, music, expanded, the, size, range, and, complexity, of, instrumental, performance, and, also, established, the, mixed, vocal, instrumental, forms, of, opera, cantata, and, oratorio, and, the, instrumental, forms, of, the, solo, concerto, and, sonata, as, musical, genres, dense, complex, polyphonic, music, in, which, multiple, independent, melody, lines, were, performed, simultaneously, a, popular, example, of, this, is, the, fugue, was, an, important, part, of, many, baroque, choral, and, instrumental, works, overall, baroque, music, was, a, tool, for, expression, and, communication, the, etymology, of, baroque, is, likely, via, the, french, baroque, which, originally, meant, a, pearl, of, irregular, shape, and, from, the, portuguese, barroco, irregular, pearl, also, related, are, the, spanish, barrueco, and, the, italian, barocco, the, term, is, of, uncertain, ultimate, origin, but, possibly, from, latin, verr, ca, wart, or, possibly, from, baroco, a, technical, term, from, scholastic, logic, the, term, baroque, is, generally, used, by, music, historians, to, describe, a, broad, range, of, styles, from, a, wide, geographic, region, mostly, in, europe, composed, over, a, period, of, about, 150, years, though, it, was, long, thought, that, the, word, as, a, critical, term, was, first, applied, to, architecture, in, fact, it, appears, earlier, in, reference, to, music, in, an, anonymous, satirical, review, of, the, premi, re, in, october, 1733, of, rameau, s, hippolyte, et, aricie, printed, in, the, mercure, de, france, in, may, 1734, the, critic, implied, that, the, novelty, in, this, opera, was, du, barocque, complaining, that, the, music, lacked, coherent, melody, was, filled, with, unremitting, dissonances, constantly, changed, key, and, meter, and, speedily, ran, through, every, compositional, device, jean, jacques, rousseau, who, was, a, musician, and, composer, as, well, as, philosopher, wrote, in, 1768, in, the, encyclop, die, baroque, music, is, that, in, which, the, harmony, is, confused, and, loaded, with, modulations, and, dissonances, the, singing, is, harsh, and, unnatural, the, intonation, difficult, and, the, movement, limited, it, appears, that, term, comes, from, the, word, baroco, used, by, logicians, rousseau, was, referring, to, the, philosophical, term, baroco, in, use, since, the, 13th, century, to, describe, a, type, of, elaborate, and, for, some, unnecessarily, complicated, academic, argument, the, systematic, application, by, historians, of, the, term, baroque, to, music, of, this, period, is, a, relatively, recent, development, in, 1919, curt, sachs, became, the, first, to, apply, the, five, characteristics, of, heinrich, w, lfflin, s, theory, of, the, baroque, systematically, to, music, critics, were, quick, to, question, the, attempt, to, transpose, w, lfflin, s, categories, to, music, however, and, in, the, second, quarter, of, the, 20th, century, independent, attempts, were, made, by, manfred, bukofzer, in, germany, and, after, his, immigration, in, america, and, by, suzanne, clercx, lejeune, in, belgium, to, use, autonomous, technical, analysis, rather, than, comparative, abstractions, in, order, to, avoid, the, adaptation, of, theories, based, on, the, plastic, arts, and, literature, to, music, all, of, these, efforts, resulted, in, appreciable, disagreement, about, time, boundaries, of, the, period, especially, concerning, when, it, began, in, english, the, term, acquired, currency, only, in, the, 1940s, in, the, writings, of, bukofzer, and, paul, henry, lang, as, late, as, 1960, there, was, still, considerable, dispute, in, academic, circles, particularly, in, france, and, britain, whether, it, was, meaningful, to, lump, together, music, as, diverse, as, that, of, jacopo, peri, domenico, scarlatti, and, johann, sebastian, bach, under, a, single, rubric, nevertheless, the, term, has, become, widely, used, and, accepted, for, this, broad, range, of, music, it, may, be, helpful, to, distinguish, the, baroque, from, both, the, preceding, renaissance, and, following, classical, periods, of, musical, history, throughout, the, baroque, era, new, developments, in, music, originated, in, italy, after, which, it, took, up, to, 20, years, before, they, were, broadly, adopted, in, rest, of, the, western, classical, music, practice, for, instance, italian, composers, switched, to, the, galant, style, around, 1730, while, german, composers, such, as, johann, sebastian, bach, largely, continued, to, write, in, the, baroque, style, up, to, 1750, the, florentine, camerata, was, a, group, of, humanists, musicians, poets, and, intellectuals, in, late, renaissance, florence, who, gathered, under, the, patronage, of, count, giovanni, de, bardi, to, discuss, and, guide, trends, in, the, arts, especially, music, and, drama, in, reference, to, music, they, based, their, ideals, on, a, perception, of, classical, especially, ancient, greek, musical, drama, that, valued, discourse, and, oration, accordingly, they, rejected, their, contemporaries, use, of, polyphony, multiple, independent, melodic, lines, and, instrumental, music, and, discussed, such, ancient, greek, music, devices, as, monody, which, consisted, of, a, solo, singing, accompanied, by, a, kithara, an, ancient, strummed, string, instrument, the, early, realizations, of, these, ideas, including, jacopo, peri, s, dafne, and, l, euridice, marked, the, beginning, of, opera, which, was, a, catalyst, for, baroque, music, concerning, music, theory, the, more, widespread, use, of, figured, bass, also, known, as, thorough, bass, represents, the, developing, importance, of, harmony, as, the, linear, underpinnings, of, polyphony, harmony, is, the, result, of, counterpoint, and, figured, bass, is, a, visual, representation, of, those, harmonies, commonly, employed, in, musical, performance, with, figured, bass, numbers, accidentals, or, symbols, were, placed, above, the, bassline, that, was, read, by, keyboard, instrument, players, such, as, harpsichord, players, or, pipe, organists, or, lutenists, the, numbers, accidentals, or, symbols, indicated, to, the, keyboard, player, what, intervals, are, to, be, played, above, each, bass, note, the, keyboard, player, would, improvise, a, chord, voicing, for, each, bass, note, composers, began, concerning, themselves, with, harmonic, progressions, and, also, employed, the, tritone, perceived, as, an, unstable, interval, to, create, dissonance, it, was, used, in, the, dominant, seventh, chord, and, the, diminished, chord, an, interest, in, harmony, had, also, existed, among, certain, composers, in, the, renaissance, notably, carlo, gesualdo, however, the, use, of, harmony, directed, towards, tonality, a, focus, on, a, musical, key, that, becomes, the, home, note, of, a, piece, rather, than, modality, marks, the, shift, from, the, renaissance, into, the, baroque, period, this, led, to, the, idea, that, certain, sequences, of, chords, rather, than, just, notes, could, provide, a, sense, of, closure, at, the, end, of, a, piece, one, of, the, fundamental, ideas, that, became, known, as, tonality, by, incorporating, these, new, aspects, of, composition, claudio, monteverdi, furthered, the, transition, from, the, renaissance, style, of, music, to, that, of, the, baroque, period, he, developed, two, individual, styles, of, composition, the, heritage, of, renaissance, polyphony, prima, pratica, and, the, new, basso, continuo, technique, of, the, baroque, seconda, pratica, with, basso, continuo, a, small, group, of, musicians, would, play, the, bassline, and, the, chords, which, formed, the, accompaniment, for, a, melody, the, basso, continuo, group, would, typically, use, one, or, more, keyboard, players, and, a, lute, player, who, would, play, the, bassline, and, improvise, the, chords, and, several, bass, instruments, e, g, bass, viola, cello, double, bass, which, would, play, the, bassline, with, the, writing, of, the, operas, l, orfeo, and, l, incoronazione, di, poppea, among, others, monteverdi, brought, considerable, attention, to, this, new, genre, this, venetian, style, was, taken, handily, to, germany, by, heinrich, sch, tz, whose, diverse, style, also, evolved, into, the, subsequent, period, idiomatic, instrumental, textures, became, increasingly, prominent, in, particular, the, style, luth, the, irregular, and, unpredictable, breaking, up, of, chordal, progressions, in, contrast, to, the, regular, patterning, of, broken, chords, referred, to, since, the, early, 20th, century, as, style, bris, was, established, as, a, consistent, texture, in, french, music, by, robert, ballard, in, his, lute, books, of, 1611, and, 1614, and, by, ennemond, gaultier, this, idiomatic, lute, figuration, was, later, transferred, to, the, harpsichord, for, example, in, the, keyboard, music, of, louis, couperin, and, jean, henri, d, anglebert, and, continued, to, be, an, important, influence, on, keyboard, music, throughout, the, 18th, and, early, 19th, centuries, in, for, example, the, music, of, johann, sebastian, bach, and, fr, d, ric, chopin, the, rise, of, the, centralized, court, is, one, of, the, economic, and, political, features, of, what, is, often, labelled, the, age, of, absolutism, personified, by, louis, xiv, of, france, the, style, of, palace, and, the, court, system, of, manners, and, arts, he, fostered, became, the, model, for, the, rest, of, europe, the, realities, of, rising, church, and, state, patronage, created, the, demand, for, organized, public, music, as, the, increasing, availability, of, instruments, created, the, demand, for, chamber, music, which, is, music, for, a, small, ensemble, of, instrumentalists, one, pre, eminent, example, of, a, court, style, composer, is, jean, baptiste, lully, he, purchased, patents, from, the, monarchy, to, be, the, sole, composer, of, operas, for, the, french, king, and, to, prevent, others, from, having, operas, staged, he, completed, 15, lyric, tragedies, and, left, unfinished, achille, et, polyx, ne, lully, was, an, early, example, of, a, conductor, he, would, beat, the, time, with, a, large, staff, to, keep, his, ensembles, together, musically, he, did, not, establish, the, string, dominated, norm, for, orchestras, which, was, inherited, from, the, italian, opera, and, the, characteristically, french, five, part, disposition, violins, violas, in, hautes, contre, tailles, and, quintes, sizes, and, bass, violins, had, been, used, in, the, ballet, from, the, time, of, louis, xiii, he, did, however, introduce, this, ensemble, to, the, lyric, theatre, with, the, upper, parts, often, doubled, by, recorders, flutes, and, oboes, and, the, bass, by, bassoons, trumpets, and, kettledrums, were, frequently, added, for, heroic, scenes, the, middle, baroque, period, in, italy, is, defined, by, the, emergence, of, the, vocal, styles, of, cantata, oratorio, and, opera, during, the, 1630s, and, a, new, concept, of, melody, and, harmony, that, elevated, the, status, of, the, music, to, one, of, equality, with, the, words, which, formerly, had, been, regarded, as, pre, eminent, the, florid, coloratura, monody, of, the, early, baroque, gave, way, to, a, simpler, more, polished, melodic, style, these, melodies, were, built, from, short, cadentially, delimited, ideas, often, based, on, stylized, dance, patterns, drawn, from, the, sarabande, or, the, courante, the, harmonies, too, might, be, simpler, than, in, the, early, baroque, monody, to, show, expression, in, a, lighter, manner, on, the, string, and, crescendos, and, diminuendos, on, longer, notes, the, accompanying, bass, lines, were, more, integrated, with, the, melody, producing, a, contrapuntal, equivalence, of, the, parts, that, later, led, to, the, device, of, an, initial, bass, anticipation, of, the, aria, melody, this, harmonic, simplification, also, led, to, a, new, formal, device, of, the, differentiation, of, recitative, a, more, spoken, part, of, opera, and, aria, a, part, of, opera, that, used, sung, melodies, the, most, important, innovators, of, this, style, were, the, romans, luigi, rossi, and, giacomo, carissimi, who, were, primarily, composers, of, cantatas, and, oratorios, respectively, and, the, venetian, francesco, cavalli, who, was, principally, an, opera, composer, later, important, practitioners, of, this, style, include, antonio, cesti, giovanni, legrenzi, and, alessandro, stradella, who, additionally, originated, the, concerto, grosso, style, in, his, sonate, di, viole, arcangelo, corelli, is, remembered, as, influential, for, his, achievements, on, the, other, side, of, musical, technique, as, a, violinist, who, organized, violin, technique, and, pedagogy, and, in, purely, instrumental, music, particularly, his, advocacy, and, development, of, the, concerto, grosso, whereas, lully, was, ensconced, at, court, corelli, was, one, of, the, first, composers, to, publish, widely, and, have, his, music, performed, all, over, europe, as, with, lully, s, stylization, and, organization, of, the, opera, the, concerto, grosso, is, built, on, strong, contrasts, sections, alternate, between, those, played, by, the, full, orchestra, and, those, played, by, a, smaller, group, fast, sections, and, slow, sections, were, juxtaposed, against, each, other, numbered, among, his, students, is, antonio, vivaldi, who, later, composed, hundreds, of, works, based, on, the, principles, in, corelli, s, trio, sonatas, and, concerti, in, contrast, to, these, composers, dieterich, buxtehude, was, not, a, creature, of, court, but, instead, was, church, musician, holding, the, posts, of, organist, and, werkmeister, at, the, marienkirche, at, l, beck, his, duties, as, werkmeister, involved, acting, as, the, secretary, treasurer, and, business, manager, of, the, church, while, his, position, as, organist, included, playing, for, all, the, main, services, sometimes, in, collaboration, with, other, instrumentalists, or, vocalists, who, were, also, paid, by, the, church, entirely, outside, of, his, official, church, duties, he, organised, and, directed, a, concert, series, known, as, the, abendmusiken, which, included, performances, of, sacred, dramatic, works, regarded, by, his, contemporaries, as, the, equivalent, of, operas, france, the, work, of, george, frideric, handel, johann, sebastian, bach, and, their, contemporaries, including, domenico, scarlatti, antonio, vivaldi, tomaso, albinoni, jean, philippe, rameau, georg, philipp, telemann, and, others, advanced, the, baroque, era, to, its, climax, the, high, baroque, italy, france, italy, proliferation, france, germany, bohemia, poland, galant, music, bach, s, elder, sons, and, pupils, mannheim, school, a, characteristic, of, the, baroque, form, was, the, dance, suite, some, dance, suites, by, bach, are, called, partitas, although, this, term, is, also, used, for, other, collections, of, pieces, while, the, pieces, in, a, dance, suite, were, inspired, by, actual, dance, music, dance, suites, were, intended, for, listening, not, for, accompanying, dancers, composers, used, a, variety, of, different, movements, in, their, dance, suites, a, dance, suite, commonly, has, these, movements, the, four, dance, types, allemande, courante, sarabande, and, gigue, make, up, the, majority, of, 17th, century, suites, later, suites, interpolate, one, or, more, additional, dances, between, the, sarabande, and, gigue, there, are, many, other, dance, forms, as, well, as, other, pieces, that, could, be, included, in, a, suite, such, as, polonaise, loure, scherzo, air, etc
