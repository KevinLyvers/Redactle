fountain, is, a, readymade, sculpture, by, marcel, duchamp, in, 1917, consisting, of, a, porcelain, urinal, signed, r, mutt, in, april, 1917, an, ordinary, piece, of, plumbing, chosen, by, duchamp, was, submitted, for, the, inaugural, exhibition, of, the, society, of, independent, artists, to, be, staged, at, the, grand, central, palace, in, new, york, when, explaining, the, purpose, of, his, readymade, sculpture, duchamp, stated, they, are, everyday, objects, raised, to, the, dignity, of, a, work, of, art, by, the, artist, s, act, of, choice, in, duchamp, s, presentation, the, urinal, s, orientation, was, altered, from, its, usual, positioning, fountain, was, not, rejected, by, the, committee, since, society, rules, stated, that, all, works, would, be, accepted, from, artists, who, paid, the, fee, but, the, work, was, never, placed, in, the, show, area, following, that, removal, fountain, was, photographed, at, alfred, stieglitz, s, studio, and, the, photo, published, in, the, dada, journal, the, blind, man, the, original, has, been, lost, the, work, is, regarded, by, art, historians, and, theorists, of, the, avant, garde, as, a, major, landmark, in, 20th, century, art, sixteen, replicas, were, commissioned, from, duchamp, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, and, made, to, his, approval, some, have, suggested, that, the, original, work, was, by, the, female, artist, elsa, von, freytag, loringhoven, who, had, submitted, it, to, duchamp, as, a, friend, but, art, historians, maintain, that, duchamp, was, solely, responsible, for, fountain, s, presentation, fountain, is, included, in, the, marcel, duchamp, catalogue, raisonn, by, arturo, schwarz, the, complete, works, of, marcel, duchamp, number, 345, marcel, duchamp, arrived, in, the, united, states, less, than, two, years, prior, to, the, creation, of, fountain, and, had, become, involved, with, francis, picabia, man, ray, and, beatrice, wood, amongst, others, in, the, creation, of, an, anti, rational, anti, art, proto, dada, cultural, movement, in, new, york, city, in, early, 1917, rumors, spread, that, duchamp, was, working, on, a, cubist, painting, titled, tulip, hysteria, co, ordinating, in, preparation, for, the, largest, exhibition, of, modern, art, ever, to, take, place, in, the, united, states, when, tulip, hysteria, co, ordinating, did, not, appear, at, the, show, those, who, had, expected, to, see, it, were, disappointed, but, the, painting, likely, never, existed, according, to, one, version, the, creation, of, fountain, began, when, accompanied, by, artist, joseph, stella, and, art, collector, walter, arensberg, duchamp, purchased, a, standard, bedfordshire, model, urinal, from, the, j, l, mott, iron, works, 118, fifth, avenue, the, artist, brought, the, urinal, to, his, studio, at, 33, west, 67th, street, reoriented, it, 90, degrees, from, its, originally, intended, position, of, use, and, wrote, on, it, r, mutt, 1917, duchamp, elaborated, mutt, comes, from, mott, works, the, name, of, a, large, sanitary, equipment, manufacturer, but, mott, was, too, close, so, i, altered, it, to, mutt, after, the, daily, cartoon, strip, mutt, and, jeff, which, appeared, at, the, time, and, with, which, everyone, was, familiar, thus, from, the, start, there, was, an, interplay, of, mutt, a, fat, little, funny, man, and, jeff, a, tall, thin, man, i, wanted, any, old, name, and, i, added, richard, that, s, not, a, bad, name, for, a, pissoti, re, get, it, the, opposite, of, poverty, but, not, even, that, much, just, r, mutt, at, the, time, duchamp, was, a, board, member, of, the, society, of, independent, artists, after, much, debate, by, the, board, members, most, of, whom, did, not, know, duchamp, had, submitted, it, as, he, had, submitted, the, work, under, a, pseudonym, about, whether, the, piece, was, or, was, not, art, fountain, was, hidden, from, view, during, the, show, duchamp, resigned, from, the, board, and, withdrew, tulip, hysteria, co, ordinating, in, protest, for, this, reason, the, work, was, suppressed, duchamp, s, expression, no, not, rejected, a, work, can, t, be, rejected, by, the, independents, it, was, simply, suppressed, i, was, on, the, jury, but, i, wasn, t, consulted, because, the, officials, didn, t, know, that, it, was, i, who, had, sent, it, in, i, had, written, the, name, mutt, on, it, to, avoid, connection, with, the, personal, the, fountain, was, simply, placed, behind, a, partition, and, for, the, duration, of, the, exhibition, i, didn, t, know, where, it, was, i, couldn, t, say, that, i, had, sent, the, thing, but, i, think, the, organizers, knew, it, through, gossip, no, one, dared, mention, it, i, had, a, falling, out, with, them, and, retired, from, the, organization, after, the, exhibition, we, found, the, fountain, again, behind, a, partition, and, i, retrieved, it, marcel, duchamp, 1971, the, new, york, dadaists, stirred, controversy, about, fountain, and, its, being, rejected, in, the, second, issue, of, the, blind, man, which, included, a, photo, of, the, piece, and, a, letter, by, alfred, stieglitz, and, writings, by, louise, norton, beatrice, wood, and, arensberg, an, editorial, possibly, written, by, wood, accompanying, the, photograph, entitled, the, richard, mutt, case, made, a, claim, that, would, prove, to, be, important, concerning, certain, works, of, art, that, would, come, after, it, whether, mr, mutt, with, his, own, hands, made, the, fountain, or, not, has, no, importance, he, chose, it, he, took, an, ordinary, article, of, life, placed, it, so, that, its, useful, significance, disappeared, under, the, new, title, and, point, of, view, created, a, new, thought, for, that, object, in, defense, of, the, work, being, art, the, piece, continues, the, only, works, of, art, america, has, given, are, her, plumbing, and, her, bridges, duchamp, described, his, intent, with, the, piece, was, to, shift, the, focus, of, art, from, physical, craft, to, intellectual, interpretation, in, a, letter, dated, 23, april, 1917, stieglitz, wrote, of, the, photograph, he, took, of, fountain, the, urinal, photograph, is, really, quite, a, wonder, everyone, who, has, seen, it, thinks, it, beautiful, and, it, s, true, it, is, it, has, an, oriental, look, about, it, a, cross, between, a, buddha, and, a, veiled, woman, in, 1918, mercure, de, france, published, an, article, attributed, to, guillaume, apollinaire, stating, fountain, originally, titled, le, bouddha, de, la, salle, de, bain, buddha, of, the, bathroom, represented, a, sitting, buddha, the, motive, invoked, for, its, refusal, at, the, independents, were, that, the, entry, was, 1, immoral, and, vulgar, 2, it, was, plagiarism, a, commercial, piece, of, plumbing, r, mutt, responded, according, to, apollinaire, that, the, work, was, not, immoral, since, similar, pieces, could, be, seen, every, day, exposed, in, plumbing, and, bath, supply, stores, on, the, second, point, r, mutt, pointed, out, that, the, fact, fountain, was, not, made, by, the, hand, of, the, artist, was, unimportant, the, importance, was, in, the, choice, made, by, the, artist, the, artist, chose, an, object, of, every, day, life, erased, its, usual, significance, by, giving, it, a, new, title, and, from, this, point, of, view, gave, a, new, purely, esthetic, meaning, to, the, object, menno, hubregtse, argues, that, duchamp, may, have, chosen, fountain, as, a, readymade, because, it, parodied, robert, j, coady, s, exaltation, of, industrial, machines, as, pure, forms, of, american, art, coady, who, championed, his, call, for, american, art, in, his, publication, the, soil, printed, a, scathing, review, of, jean, crotti, s, portrait, of, marcel, duchamp, sculpture, made, to, measure, in, the, december, 1916, issue, hubregtse, notes, that, duchamp, s, urinal, may, have, been, a, clever, response, to, coady, s, comparison, of, crotti, s, sculpture, with, the, absolute, expression, of, a, plumber, some, have, contested, that, duchamp, created, fountain, but, rather, assisted, in, submitting, the, piece, to, the, society, of, independent, artists, for, a, female, friend, in, a, letter, dated, 11, april, 1917, duchamp, wrote, to, his, sister, suzanne, une, de, mes, amies, sous, un, pseudonyme, masculin, richard, mutt, avait, envoy, une, pissoti, re, en, porcelaine, comme, sculpture, one, of, my, female, friends, under, a, masculine, pseudonym, richard, mutt, sent, in, a, porcelain, urinal, as, a, sculpture, duchamp, never, identified, his, female, friend, but, three, candidates, have, been, proposed, an, early, appearance, of, duchamp, s, female, alter, ego, rrose, s, lavy, the, dadaist, elsa, von, freytag, loringhoven, or, louise, norton, a, dada, poet, and, a, close, friend, of, duchamp, later, married, to, the, avant, garde, french, composer, edgard, var, se, who, contributed, an, essay, to, the, blind, man, discussing, fountain, and, whose, address, is, partially, discernible, on, the, paper, entry, ticket, in, the, stieglitz, photograph, on, one, hand, the, fact, that, duchamp, wrote, sent, not, made, does, not, indicate, that, someone, else, created, the, work, duchamp, s, female, alter, ego, has, been, discredited, as, the, inception, of, rrose, s, lavy, occurred, in, the, 1920s, years, after, the, initial, exhibition, furthermore, there, is, no, documentary, or, testimonial, evidence, that, suggests, von, freytag, created, fountain, however, despite, a, lack, of, documentary, evidence, it, has, been, proven, that, von, freytag, had, been, experimenting, with, the, concept, of, bodily, fluids, as, high, art, in, her, practice, even, collaborating, with, photographer, morton, livingston, schamberg, on, the, piece, god, 1917, which, maintains, a, similar, message, and, aesthetic, to, that, of, fountain, the, piece, had, been, attributed, to, schamberg, until, the, philadelphia, museum, of, art, adjusted, the, accreditation, further, arguments, against, duchamp, as, author, have, included, that, the, r, mutt, signature, makes, more, sense, as, a, german, pun, on, armut, poverty, or, mutter, mother, taking, into, consideration, the, geo, political, climate, at, the, time, and, the, tension, between, germany, and, the, us, glyn, thompson, argues, this, was, loringhoven, s, attempt, at, political, commentary, thompson, also, disputes, duchamp, s, own, claim, that, he, made, in, 1966, to, otto, hanh, of, the, urinal, s, origins, coming, from, the, j, l, mott, iron, works, plumbing, retailer, as, thompson, discovered, they, could, not, have, stocked, this, type, of, urinal, the, only, place, it, could, be, purchased, at, that, time, was, in, philadelphia, where, loringhoven, was, residing, at, the, time, thompson, uses, this, research, to, claim, that, the, signature, could, not, have, been, inspired, by, the, name, of, j, l, mott, because, duchamp, could, not, have, purchased, the, urinal, there, shortly, after, its, initial, exhibition, fountain, was, lost, according, to, duchamp, biographer, calvin, tomkins, the, best, guess, is, that, it, was, thrown, out, as, rubbish, by, stieglitz, a, common, fate, of, duchamp, s, early, readymades, however, the, myth, goes, that, the, original, fountain, was, in, fact, not, thrown, out, but, returned, to, richard, mutt, by, duchamp, the, reaction, engendered, by, fountain, continued, for, weeks, following, the, exhibition, submission, an, article, was, published, in, boston, on, 25, april, 1917, a, philadelphian, richard, mutt, member, of, the, society, and, not, related, to, our, friend, of, the, mutt, and, jeff, cartoons, submitted, a, bathroom, fixture, as, a, work, of, art, the, official, record, of, the, episode, of, its, removal, says, richard, mutt, threatens, to, sue, the, directors, because, they, removed, the, bathroom, fixture, mounted, on, a, pedestal, which, he, submitted, as, a, work, of, art, some, of, the, directors, wanted, it, to, remain, in, view, of, the, society, s, ruling, of, no, jury, to, decide, on, the, merits, of, the, 2500, paintings, and, sculptures, submitted, other, directors, maintained, that, it, was, indecent, at, a, meeting, and, the, majority, voted, it, down, as, a, result, of, this, marcel, duchamp, retired, from, the, board, mr, mutt, now, wants, more, than, his, dues, returned, he, wants, damages, duchamp, began, making, miniature, reproductions, of, fountain, in, 1935, first, in, papier, m, ch, and, then, in, porcelain, for, his, multiple, editions, of, a, miniature, museum, retrospective, titled, bo, te, en, valise, or, box, in, a, suitcase, 1935, 66, duchamp, carried, many, of, these, miniature, works, within, the, suitcase, which, were, replicas, of, some, of, his, most, prominent, work, the, first, 1, 1, reproduction, of, fountain, was, authorized, by, duchamp, in, 1950, for, an, exhibition, in, new, york, two, more, individual, pieces, followed, in, 1953, and, 1963, and, then, an, artist, s, multiple, was, manufactured, in, an, edition, of, eight, in, 1964, these, editions, ended, up, in, a, number, of, important, public, collections, indiana, university, art, museum, san, francisco, museum, of, modern, art, the, national, gallery, of, canada, centre, georges, pompidou, and, tate, modern, the, edition, of, eight, was, manufactured, from, glazed, earthenware, painted, to, resemble, the, original, porcelain, with, a, signature, reproduced, in, black, paint, of, all, the, artworks, in, this, series, of, readymades, fountain, is, perhaps, the, best, known, because, the, symbolic, meaning, of, the, toilet, takes, the, conceptual, challenge, posed, by, the, readymades, to, their, most, visceral, extreme, similarly, philosopher, stephen, hicks, argued, that, duchamp, who, was, quite, familiar, with, the, history, of, european, art, was, obviously, making, a, provocative, statement, with, fountain, the, artist, is, a, not, great, creator, duchamp, went, shopping, at, a, plumbing, store, the, artwork, is, not, a, special, object, it, was, mass, produced, in, a, factory, the, experience, of, art, is, not, exciting, and, ennobling, at, best, it, is, puzzling, and, mostly, leaves, one, with, a, sense, of, distaste, but, over, and, above, that, duchamp, did, not, select, just, any, ready, made, object, to, display, in, selecting, the, urinal, his, message, was, clear, art, is, something, you, piss, on, the, impact, of, duchamp, s, fountain, changed, the, way, people, view, art, due, to, his, focus, upon, cerebral, art, contrary, to, merely, retinal, art, as, this, was, a, means, to, engage, prospective, audiences, in, a, thought, provoking, way, as, opposed, to, satisfying, the, aesthetic, status, quo, turning, from, classicism, to, modernity, since, the, photograph, taken, by, stieglitz, is, the, only, image, of, the, original, sculpture, there, are, some, interpretations, of, fountain, by, looking, not, only, at, reproductions, but, this, particular, photograph, tomkins, notes, arensberg, had, referred, to, a, lovely, form, and, it, does, not, take, much, stretching, of, the, imagination, to, see, in, the, upside, down, urinal, s, gently, flowing, curves, the, veiled, head, of, a, classic, renaissance, madonna, or, a, seated, buddha, or, perhaps, more, to, the, point, one, of, br, ncu, i, s, polished, erotic, forms, expanding, upon, the, erotic, interpretation, linked, to, br, ncu, i, s, work, tim, martin, has, argued, there, were, strong, sexual, connotations, with, the, fountain, linked, to, it, being, placed, horizontally, he, goes, onto, say, in, placing, the, urinal, horizontally, it, appears, more, passive, and, feminine, while, remaining, a, receptacle, designed, for, the, functioning, of, the, male, penis, the, meaning, if, any, and, intention, of, both, the, piece, and, the, signature, r, mutt, are, difficult, to, pin, down, precisely, it, is, not, clear, whether, duchamp, had, in, mind, the, german, armut, meaning, poverty, or, possibly, urmutter, meaning, great, mother, the, name, r, mutt, could, also, be, a, play, on, its, commercial, origins, or, on, the, famous, comic, strip, of, the, time, mutt, and, jeff, making, the, urinal, perhaps, the, first, work, of, art, based, on, a, comic, duchamp, said, the, r, stood, for, richard, french, slang, for, moneybags, which, according, to, one, critic, makes, fountain, a, kind, of, scatological, golden, calf, rhonda, roland, shearer, in, the, online, journal, tout, fait, 2000, suspects, that, the, stieglitz, photograph, is, a, composite, of, different, photos, while, other, scholars, such, as, william, camfield, have, never, been, able, to, match, the, urinal, shown, in, the, photo, to, any, urinals, found, in, the, catalogues, of, the, time, period, in, a, 1964, interview, with, otto, hahn, duchamp, suggested, he, purposefully, selected, a, urinal, because, it, was, disagreeable, the, choice, of, a, urinal, according, to, duchamp, sprang, from, the, idea, of, making, an, experiment, concerned, with, taste, choose, the, object, which, has, the, least, chance, of, being, liked, a, urinal, very, few, people, think, there, is, anything, wonderful, about, a, urinal, rudolf, e, kuenzli, states, in, dada, and, surrealist, film, 1996, after, describing, how, various, readymades, are, presented, or, displayed, this, decontextualization, of, the, object, s, functional, place, draws, attention, to, the, creation, of, its, artistic, meaning, by, the, choice, of, the, setting, and, positioning, ascribed, to, the, object, he, goes, on, to, explain, the, importance, of, naming, the, object, ascribing, a, title, at, least, three, factors, came, into, play, the, choice, of, object, the, title, and, how, it, was, modified, if, at, all, from, its, normal, position, or, location, by, virtue, of, placing, a, urinal, on, a, pedestal, in, an, art, exhibition, the, illusion, of, an, artwork, was, created, duchamp, drew, an, ink, copy, of, the, 1917, stieglitz, photograph, in, 1964, for, the, cover, of, an, exhibition, catalogue, marcel, duchamp, ready, mades, etc, 1913, 1964, the, illustration, appeared, as, a, photographic, negative, later, duchamp, made, a, positive, version, titled, mirrorical, return, renvoi, miroirique, 1964, dalia, judovitz, writes, structured, as, an, emblem, the, visual, and, linguistic, elements, set, up, a, punning, interplay, that, helps, us, to, explore, further, the, mechanisms, that, fountain, actively, stages, on, the, one, hand, there, is, the, mirror, effect, of, the, drawing, and, the, etching, which, although, they, are, almost, identical, visually, involve, an, active, switch, from, one, artistic, medium, to, the, other, on, the, other, hand, there, is, the, internal, mirrorical, return, of, the, image, itself, since, this, urinal, like, the, one, in, 1917, has, been, rotated, ninety, degrees, this, internal, rotation, disqualifies, the, object, from, its, common, use, as, a, receptacle, and, reactivates, its, poetic, potential, as, a, fountain, that, is, as, a, machine, for, waterworks, the, splash, generated, by, fountain, is, thus, tied, to, its, mirrorical, return, like, the, faucet, in, the, title, during, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, as, fountain, and, other, readymades, were, rediscovered, duchamp, became, a, cultural, icon, in, the, world, of, art, exemplified, by, a, deluge, of, publications, as, camfield, noted, an, unparalleled, example, of, timing, in, which, the, burgeoning, interest, in, duchamp, coincided, with, exhilarating, developments, in, avant, garde, art, virtually, all, of, which, exhibited, links, of, some, sort, to, duchamp, his, art, was, transformed, from, a, minor, aberrant, phenomenon, in, the, history, of, modern, art, to, the, most, dynamic, force, in, contemporary, art, in, december, 2004, duchamp, s, fountain, was, voted, the, most, influential, artwork, of, the, 20th, century, by, 500, selected, british, art, world, professionals, second, place, was, afforded, to, picasso, s, les, demoiselles, d, avignon, 1907, and, third, to, andy, warhol, s, marilyn, diptych, 1962, the, independent, noted, in, a, february, 2008, article, that, with, this, single, work, duchamp, invented, conceptual, art, and, severed, forever, the, traditional, link, between, the, artist, s, labour, and, the, merit, of, the, work, jerry, saltz, wrote, in, the, village, voice, in, 2006, duchamp, adamantly, asserted, that, he, wanted, to, de, deify, the, artist, the, readymades, provide, a, way, around, inflexible, either, or, aesthetic, propositions, they, represent, a, copernican, shift, in, art, fountain, is, what, s, called, an, acheropoietoi, an, image, not, shaped, by, the, hands, of, an, artist, fountain, brings, us, into, contact, with, an, original, that, is, still, an, original, but, that, also, exists, in, an, altered, philosophical, and, metaphysical, state, it, is, a, manifestation, of, the, kantian, sublime, a, work, of, art, that, transcends, a, form, but, that, is, also, intelligible, an, object, that, strikes, down, an, idea, while, allowing, it, to, spring, up, stronger, others, have, questioned, whether, duchamp, s, fountain, really, could, constitute, a, work, of, art, grayson, perry, stated, in, playing, to, the, gallery, in, 2014, when, he, decided, that, anything, could, be, art, he, got, a, urinal, and, brought, it, into, an, art, gallery, i, find, it, quite, arrogant, that, idea, of, just, pointing, at, something, and, saying, that, s, art, several, performance, artists, have, attempted, to, contribute, to, the, piece, by, urinating, in, it, south, african, born, artist, kendell, geers, rose, to, international, notoriety, in, 1993, when, at, a, show, in, venice, he, urinated, into, fountain, artist, musician, brian, eno, declared, he, successfully, urinated, in, fountain, while, it, was, exhibited, in, the, moma, in, 1993, he, admitted, that, it, was, only, a, technical, triumph, because, he, needed, to, urinate, in, a, tube, in, advance, so, he, could, convey, the, fluid, through, a, gap, between, the, protective, glass, swedish, artist, bj, rn, kjelltoft, urinated, in, fountain, at, moderna, museet, in, stockholm, in, 1999, in, spring, 2000, yuan, chai, and, jian, jun, xi, two, performance, artists, who, in, 1999, had, jumped, on, tracey, emin, s, installation, sculpture, my, bed, in, the, turner, prize, exhibition, at, tate, britain, went, to, the, newly, opened, tate, modern, and, tried, to, urinate, on, the, fountain, which, was, on, display, however, they, were, prevented, from, soiling, the, sculpture, directly, by, its, perspex, case, the, tate, which, denied, that, the, duo, had, succeeded, in, urinating, into, the, sculpture, itself, banned, them, from, the, premises, stating, that, they, were, threatening, works, of, art, and, our, staff, when, asked, why, they, felt, they, had, to, add, to, duchamp, s, work, chai, said, the, urinal, is, there, it, s, an, invitation, as, duchamp, said, himself, it, s, the, artist, s, choice, he, chooses, what, is, art, we, just, added, to, it, on, january, 4, 2006, while, on, display, in, the, dada, show, in, the, pompidou, centre, in, paris, fountain, was, attacked, by, pierre, pinoncelli, a, 76, year, old, french, performance, artist, most, noted, for, damaging, two, of, the, eight, copies, of, fountain, the, hammer, he, used, during, the, assault, on, the, artwork, caused, a, slight, chip, pinoncelli, who, was, arrested, said, the, attack, was, a, work, of, performance, art, that, marcel, duchamp, himself, would, have, appreciated, in, 1993, pinoncelli, urinated, into, the, piece, while, it, was, on, display, in, nimes, in, southern, france, both, of, pinoncelli, s, performances, derive, from, neo, dadaists, and, viennese, actionists, intervention, or, manoeuvre, appropriation, artist, sherrie, levine, created, bronze, copies, in, 1991, and, 1996, titled, fountain, madonna, and, fountain, buddha, respectively, they, are, considered, to, be, an, homage, to, duchamp, s, renowned, readymade, by, doing, so, levine, is, re, evaluating, 3d, objects, within, the, realm, of, appropriation, like, the, readymades, to, mass, produced, photographic, art, adding, to, duchamp, s, audacious, move, levine, turns, his, gesture, back, into, an, art, object, by, elevating, its, materiality, and, finish, as, a, feminist, artist, levine, remakes, works, specifically, by, male, artists, who, commandeered, patriarchal, dominance,
