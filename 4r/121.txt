the, first, division, was, between, prose, and, poetry, within, poetry, there, were, three, super, genres, epic, lyric, and, drama, the, common, european, terminology, about, literary, genres, is,

by, individuals, or, a, chorus, accompanied, by, the, instrument, called, the, lyre, despite, the, name, the, lyric, poetry, in, this, general, meaning, was, divided, in, four, genres, two, of, which, were, not, accompanied, by, cithara, but, by, flute, these, two, latter, genres, were, elegiac, poetry, and, iambic, poetry, both, were, written, in, the, ionic, dialect, elegiac, poems, were,

important, iambic, poet, only, fragments, remain, of, his, work, as, is, the, case, with, most, of, the, poets, the, few, remnants, suggest, that, he, was, an, embittered, adventurer, who, led, a, very, turbulent, life, many, lyric, poems, were, written, in, the, aeolic, dialect, lyric, poems, often, employed, highly, varied, poetic, meters, the, most, famous, of, all, lyric, poets, were, the, so, called, nine, lyric, poets, of, all, the, lyric, poets, sappho, of, lesbos, c, 630, c, 570, bc, was, by, far, the, most, widely, revered, in, antiquity, her, poems, were, regarded, with, the, same, degree, of, respect, as, the, poems, of, homer, only, one, of, her, poems, ode, to, aphrodite, has, survived, to, the, present, day, in, its, original, completed, form, in, addition, to, sappho, her, contemporary, alcaeus, of, lesbos, was, also, notable, for, monodic, lyric, poetry, the, poetry, written, by, alcman, was, considered, beautiful, even, though, he, wrote, exclusively, in, the, doric, dialect, which, was, normally, considered, unpleasant, to, hear, the, later, poet, pindar, of, thebes, was, renowned, for, his, choral, lyric, poetry, all, surviving, works, of, greek, drama, were, composed, by, playwrights, from, athens, and, are, written, exclusively, in, the, attic, dialect, choral, performances, were, a, common, tradition, in, all, greek, city, states, the, athenians, credited, a, man, named, thespis, with, having, invented, drama, by, introducing, the, first, actor, whose, primary, purpose, was, to, interact, with, the, leader, of, the, chorus, later, playwrights, expanded, the, number, of, actors, to, three, allowing, for, greater, freedom, in, storytelling, in, the, age, that, followed, the, greco, persian, wars, the, awakened, national, spirit, of, athens, was, expressed, in, hundreds, of, tragedies, based, on, heroic, and, legendary, themes, of, the, past, the, tragic, plays, grew, out, of, simple, choral, songs, and, dialogues, performed, at, festivals, of, the, god, dionysus, in, the, classical, period, performances, included, three, tragedies, and, one, pastoral, drama, depicting, four, different, episodes, of, the, same, myth, wealthy, citizens, were, chosen, to, bear, the, expense, of, costuming, and, training, the, chorus, as, a, public, and, religious, duty, attendance, at, the, festival, performances, was, regarded, as, an, act, of, worship, performances, were, held, in, the, great, open, air, theater, of, dionysus, in, athens, the, poets, competed, for, the, prizes, offered, for, the, best, plays, all, fully, surviving, greek, tragedies, are, conventionally, attributed, to, aeschylus, sophocles, or, euripides, the, authorship, of, prometheus, bound, which, is, traditionally, attributed, to, aeschylus, and, rhesus, which, is, traditionally, attributed, to, euripides, are, however, questioned, there, are, seven, surviving, tragedies, attributed, to, aeschylus, three, of, these, plays, agamemnon, the, libation, bearers, and, the, eumenides, form, a, trilogy, known, as, the, oresteia, one, of, these, plays, prometheus, bound, however, may, actually, be, the, work, of, aeschylus, s, son, euphorion, seven, works, of, sophocles, have, survived, the, most, acclaimed, of, which, are, the, three, theban, plays, which, center, around, the, story, of, oedipus, and, his, offspring, the, theban, trilogy, consists, of, oedipus, the, king, oedipus, at, colonus, and, antigone, although, the, plays, are, often, called, a, trilogy, they, were, written, many, years, apart, antigone, the, last, of, the, three, plays, sequentially, was, actually, first, to, be, written, having, been, composed, in, 441, bc, towards, the, beginning, of, sophocles, s, career, oedipus, the, king, the, most, famous, of, the, three, was, written, around, 429, bc, at, the, midpoint, of, sophocles, s, career, oedipus, at, colonus, the, second, of, the, three, plays, chronologically, was, actually, sophocles, s, last, play, and, was, performed, in, 401, bc, after, sophocles, s, death, there, are, nineteen, surviving, plays, attributed, to, euripides, the, most, well, known, of, these, plays, are, medea, hippolytus, and, bacchae, rhesus, is, sometimes, thought, to, have, been, written, by, euripides, son, or, to, have, been, a, posthumous, reproduction, of, a, play, by, euripides, euripides, pushed, the, limits, of, the, tragic, genre, and, many, of, the, elements, in, his, plays, were, more, typical, of, comedy, than, tragedy, his, play, alcestis, for, instance, has, often, been, categorized, as, a, problem, play, or, perhaps, even, as, a, work, of, tragicomedy, rather, than, a, true, tragedy, due, to, its, comedic, elements, and, the, fact, that, it, has, a, happy, ending, like, tragedy, comedy, arose, from, a, ritual, in, honor, of, dionysus, but, in, this, case, the, plays, were, full, of, frank, obscenity, abuse, and, insult, at, athens, the, comedies, became, an, official, part, of, the, festival, celebration, in, 486, bc, and, prizes, were, offered, for, the, best, productions, as, with, the, tragedians, few, works, remain, of, the, great, comedic, writers, the, only, complete, surviving, works, of, classical, comedy, are, eleven, plays, written, by, the, playwright, aristophanes, these, are, a, treasure, trove, of, comic, presentation, he, poked, fun, at, everyone, and, every, institution, in, the, birds, he, ridicules, athenian, democracy, in, the, clouds, he, attacks, the, philosopher, socrates, in, lysistrata, he, denounces, war, aristophanes, has, been, praised, highly, for, his, dramatic, skill, and, artistry, john, lempri, re, s, bibliotheca, classica, describes, him, as, quite, simply, the, greatest, comic, dramatist, in, world, literature, by, his, side, moli, re, seems, dull, and, shakespeare, clownish, of, all, aristophanes, s, plays, however, the, one, that, has, received, the, most, lasting, recognition, is, the, frogs, which, simultaneously, satirizes, and, immortalizes, the, two, giants, of, athenian, tragedy, aeschylus, and, euripides, when, it, was, performed, for, the, first, time, at, the, lenaia, festival, in, 405, bc, just, one, year, after, the, death, of, euripides, the, athenians, awarded, it, first, prize, it, was, the, only, greek, play, that, was, ever, given, an, encore, performance, which, took, place, two, months, later, at, the, city, dionysia, even, today, the, frogs, still, appeals, to, modern, audiences, a, commercially, successful, modern, musical, adaptation, of, it, was, performed, on, broadway, in, 2004, the, third, dramatic, genre, was, the, satyr, play, although, the, genre, was, popular, only, one, complete, example, of, a, satyr, play, has, survived, cyclops, by, euripides, large, portions, of, a, second, satyr, play, ichneutae, by, sophocles, have, been, recovered, from, the, site, of, oxyrhynchus, in, egypt, among, the, oxyrhynchus, papyri, two, notable, historians, who, lived, during, the, classical, era, were, herodotus, of, halicarnassus, and, thucydides, herodotus, is, commonly, called, the, father, of, history, his, book, the, histories, is, among, the, oldest, works, of, prose, literature, in, existence, thucydides, s, book, history, of, the, peloponnesian, war, greatly, influenced, later, writers, and, historians, including, the, author, of, the, book, of, acts, of, the, apostles, and, the, byzantine, era, historian, procopius, of, caesarea, a, third, historian, of, ancient, greece, xenophon, of, athens, began, his, hellenica, where, thucydides, ended, his, work, about, 411, bc, and, carried, his, history, to, 362, bc, xenophon, s, most, famous, work, is, his, book, the, anabasis, a, detailed, first, hand, account, of, his, participation, in, a, greek, mercenary, army, that, tried, to, help, the, persian, cyrus, expel, his, brother, from, the, throne, another, famous, work, relating, to, persian, history, is, his, cyropaedia, xenophon, also, wrote, three, works, in, praise, of, the, philosopher, socrates, the, apology, of, socrates, to, the, jury, the, symposium, and, memorabilia, although, both, xenophon, and, plato, knew, socrates, their, accounts, are, very, different, many, comparisons, have, been, made, between, the, account, of, the, military, historian, and, the, account, of, the, poet, philosopher, many, important, and, influential, philosophers, lived, during, the, fifth, and, fourth, centuries, bc, among, the, earliest, greek, philosophers, were, the, three, so, called, milesian, philosophers, thales, of, miletus, anaximander, and, anaximenes, of, these, philosophers, writings, however, only, one, fragment, from, anaximander, preserved, by, simplicius, of, cilicia, has, survived, very, little, is, known, for, certain, about, the, life, of, the, philosopher, pythagoras, of, samos, and, no, writings, by, him, have, survived, to, the, present, day, but, an, impressive, corpus, of, poetic, writings, written, by, his, pupil, empedocles, of, acragas, has, survived, making, empedocles, one, of, the, most, widely, attested, pre, socratic, philosophers, a, large, number, of, fragments, written, by, the, philosophers, heraclitus, of, ephesus, and, democritus, of, abdera, have, also, survived, of, all, the, classical, philosophers, however, socrates, plato, and, aristotle, are, generally, considered, the, most, important, and, influential, socrates, did, not, write, any, books, himself, and, modern, scholars, debate, whether, or, not, plato, s, portrayal, of, him, is, accurate, some, scholars, contend, that, many, of, his, ideas, or, at, least, a, vague, approximation, of, them, are, expressed, in, plato, s, early, socratic, dialogues, meanwhile, other, scholars, have, argued, that, plato, s, portrayal, of, socrates, is, merely, a, fictional, representation, intended, to, expound, plato, s, own, opinions, who, has, very, little, to, do, with, the, historical, figure, of, the, same, name, the, debate, over, the, extent, to, which, plato, s, portrayal, of, socrates, represents, the, actual, socrates, s, ideas, is, known, as, the, socratic, problem, plato, expressed, his, ideas, through, dialogues, that, is, written, works, purporting, to, describe, conversations, between, different, individuals, some, of, the, best, known, of, these, include, the, apology, of, socrates, a, purported, record, of, the, speech, socrates, gave, at, his, trial, phaedo, a, description, of, the, last, conversation, between, socrates, and, his, disciples, before, his, execution, the, symposium, a, dialogue, over, the, nature, of, love, and, the, republic, widely, regarded, as, plato, s, most, important, work, a, long, dialogue, describing, the, ideal, government, aristotle, of, stagira, is, widely, considered, to, be, one, of, the, most, important, and, influential, philosophical, thinkers, of, all, time, the, first, sentence, of, his, metaphysics, reads, all, men, by, nature, desire, to, know, he, has, therefore, been, called, the, father, of, those, who, know, his, medieval, disciple, thomas, aquinas, referred, to, him, simply, as, the, philosopher, aristotle, was, a, student, at, plato, s, academy, and, like, his, teacher, he, wrote, dialogues, or, conversations, however, none, of, these, exist, today, the, body, of, writings, that, have, come, down, to, the, present, probably, represents, lectures, that, he, delivered, at, his, own, school, in, athens, the, lyceum, even, from, these, books, the, enormous, range, of, his, interests, is, evident, he, explored, matters, other, than, those, that, are, today, considered, philosophical, the, extant, treatises, cover, logic, the, physical, and, biological, sciences, ethics, politics, and, constitutional, government, among, aristotle, s, most, notable, works, are, politics, nicomachean, ethics, poetics, on, the, soul, and, rhetoric, by, 338, bc, all, of, the, greek, city, states, except, sparta, had,

years, in, the, third, century, bc, the, aetia, was, lost, during, the, middle, ages, but, over, the, course, of, the, twentieth, century, much, of, it, was, recovered, due, to, new, discoveries, of, ancient, papyri, scholars, initially, denigrated, it, as, second, rate, showing, great, learning, but, lacking, true, art, over, the, course, of, the, century, scholarly, appraisal, of, it, greatly, improved, with, many, scholars, now, seeing, it, in, a, much, more, positive, light, callimachus, also, wrote, short, poems, for, special, occasions, and, at, least, one, short, epic, the, ibis,
