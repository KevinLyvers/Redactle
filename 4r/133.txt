achaemenid, inscription, the, behistun, inscription, the, bulk, of, surviving, persian, literature, however, comes, from, the, times, following, the, muslim, conquest, of, persia, c, 650, ce, after, the, abbasids, came, to, power, 750, ce, the, iranians, became, the, scribes, and, bureaucrats, of, the, islamic, caliphate, and, increasingly, also, its, writers, and, poets, the, new, persian, language, literature, arose, and, flourished, in, khorasan, and, transoxiana, because, of, political, reasons, early, iranian, dynasties, of, post, islamic, iran, such, as, the, tahirids, and, samanids, being, based, in, khorasan, persian, poets, such, as, ferdowsi, saadi, hafiz, attar, nezami, rumi, and, omar, khayyam, are, also, known, in, the, west, and, have, influenced, the, literature, of, many, countries, very, few, literary, works, of, achaemenid, iran, have, survived, partly, due, to, the, destruction, of, the, library, at, persepolis, most, of, what, remains, consists, of, the, royal, inscriptions, of, achaemenid, kings, particularly, darius, i, 522, 486, bc, and, his, son, xerxes, many, zoroastrian, writings, were, destroyed, in, the, islamic, conquest, of, iran, in, the, 7th, century, the, parsis, who, fled, to, india, however, took, with, them, some, of, the, books, of, the, zoroastrian, canon, including, some, of, the, avesta, and, ancient, commentaries, zend, thereof, some, works, of, sassanid, geography, and, travel, also, survived, albeit, in, arabic, translations, no, single, text, devoted, to, literary, criticism, has, survived, from, pre, islamic, iran, however, some, essays, in, pahlavi, such, as, ayin, e, name, nebeshtan, principles, of, writing, book, and, bab, e, edteda, i, ye, kalileh, o, demneh, have, been, considered, as, literary, criticism, zarrinkoub, 1959, some, researchers, have, quoted, the, sho, ubiyye, as, asserting, that, the, pre, islamic, iranians, had, books, on, eloquence, such, as, karvand, no, trace, remains, of, such, books, there, are, some, indications, that, some, among, the, persian, elite, were, familiar, with, greek, rhetoric, and, literary, criticism, zarrinkoub, 1947, while, initially, overshadowed, by, arabic, during, the, umayyad, and, early, abbasid, caliphates, new, persian, soon, became, a, literary, language, again, of, the, central, asian, and, west, asian, lands, the, rebirth, of, the, language, in, its, new, form, is, often, accredited, to, ferdowsi, unsuri, daqiqi, rudaki, and, their, generation, as, they, used, pre, islamic, nationalism, as, a, conduit, to, revive, the, language, and, customs, of, ancient, iran, so, strong, is, the, persian, inclination, to, versifying, everyday, expressions, that, one, can, encounter, poetry, in, almost, every, classical, work, whether, from, persian, literature, science, or, metaphysics, in, short, the, ability, to, write, in, verse, form, was, a, pre, requisite, for, any, scholar, for, example, almost, half, of, avicenna, s, medical, writings, are, in, verse, works, of, the, early, era, of, persian, poetry, are, characterized, by, strong, court, patronage, an, extravagance, of, panegyrics, and, what, is, known, as, exalted, in, style, the, tradition, of, royal, patronage, began, perhaps, under, the, sassanid, era, and, carried, over, through, the, abbasid, and, samanid, courts, into, every, major, iranian, dynasty, the, qasida, was, perhaps, the, most, famous, form, of, panegyric, used, though, quatrains, such, as, those, in, omar, khayyam, s, ruba, iyyat, are, also, widely, popular, khorasani, style, whose, followers, mostly, were, associated, with, greater, khorasan, is, characterized, by, its, supercilious, diction, dignified, tone, and, relatively, literate, language, the, chief, representatives, of, this, lyricism, are, asjadi, farrukhi, sistani, unsuri, and, manuchehri, panegyric, masters, such, as, rudaki, were, known, for, their, love, of, nature, their, verses, abounding, with, evocative, descriptions, through, these, courts, and, system, of, patronage, emerged, the, epic, style, of, poetry, with, ferdowsi, s, shahnama, at, the, apex, by, glorifying, the, iranian, historical, past, in, heroic, and, elevated, verses, he, and, other, notables, such, as, daqiqi, and, asadi, tusi, presented, the, ajam, with, a, source, of, pride, and, inspiration, that, has, helped, preserve, a, sense, of, identity, for, the, iranian, people, over, the, ages, ferdowsi, set, a, model, to, be, followed, by, a, host, of, other, poets, later, on, the, 13th, century, marks, the, ascendancy, of, lyric, poetry, with, the, consequent, development, of, the, ghazal, into, a, major, verse, form, as, well, as, the, rise, of, mystical, and, sufi, poetry, this, style, is, often, called, araqi, iraqi, style, araq, e, ajam, and, is, known, by, its, emotional, lyric, qualities, rich, meters, and, the, relative, simplicity, of, its, language, emotional, romantic, poetry, was, not, something, new, however, as, works, such, as, vis, o, ramin, by, as, ad, gorgani, and, yusof, o, zoleikha, by, am, aq, bokharai, exemplify, poets, such, as, sana, i, and, attar, who, ostensibly, inspired, rumi, khaqani, shirvani, anvari, and, nizami, were, highly, respected, ghazal, writers, however, the, elite, of, this, school, are, rumi, saadi, and, hafiz, shirazi, regarding,

panegyrics, from, the, beginning, of, persian, poetry, and, of, the, ghazal, during, the, same, safavid, era, many, subjects, of, the, iranian, safavids, were, patrons, of, persian, poetry, such, as,

attar, s, works, also, belong, to, this, genre, as, do, the, major, works, of, rumi, although, some, tend, to, classify, these, in, the, lyrical, type, due, to, their, mystical, and, emotional, qualities, in, addition, some, tend, to, group, naser, khosrow, s, works, in, this, style, as, well, however, true, gems, of, this, genre, are, two, books, by, saadi, a, heavyweight, of, persian,

and, arabic, loanwords, contained, in, those, works, increased, at, times, up, to, 88, the, ottomans, produced, thousands, of, persian, literary, works, throughout, their, century, long, lifespan,

the, balkans, insofar, as, that, it, was, a, town, where, persian, was, also, widely, spoken, however, the, persian, of, vardar, yenicesi, and, throughout, the, rest, of, the, ottoman, held, balkans, was, different, from, formal, persian, both, in, accent, and, vocabulary, the, difference, was, apparent, to, such, a, degree, that, the, ottomans, referred, to, it, as, rumelian, persian, rumili,

change, was, exemplified, by, an, incident, in, the, mid, 19th, century, at, the, court, of, nasereddin, shah, when, the, reform, minded, prime, minister, amir, kabir, chastised, the, poet, habibollah, qa, ani, shirazi, for, lying, in, a, panegyric, qasida, written, in, kabir, s, honor, kabir, saw, poetry, in, general, and, the, type, of, poetry, that, had, developed, during, the, qajar, period, as, detrimental, to, progress, and, modernization, in, iranian, society, which, he, believed, was, in, dire, need, of, change, such, concerns, were, also, expressed, by, others, such, as, fath, ali, akhundzadeh, mirza, aqa, khan, kermani, and, mirza, malkom, khan, khan, also, addressed, a, need, for, a, change, in, persian, poetry, in, literary, terms, as, well, always, linking, it, to, social, concerns, the, new, persian, literary, movement, cannot, be, understood, without, an, understanding, of, the, intellectual, movements, among, iranian, philosophical, circles, given, the, social, and, political, climate, of, persia, iran, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, which, led, to, the, persian, constitutional, revolution, of, 1906, 1911, the, idea, that, change, in, poetry, was, necessary, became, widespread, many, argued, that, persian, poetry, should, reflect, the, realities, of, a, country, in, transition, this, idea, was, propagated, by, notable, literary, figures, such, as, ali, akbar, dehkhoda, and, abolqasem, aref, who, challenged, the, traditional, system, of, persian, poetry, in, terms, of, introducing, new, content, and, experimentation, with, rhetoric, lexico, semantics, and, structure, dehkhoda, for, instance, used, a, lesser, known, traditional, form, the, mosammat, to, elegize, the, execution, of, a, revolutionary, journalist, aref, employed, the, ghazal, the, most, central, genre, within, the, lyrical, tradition, p, 88, to, write, his, payam, e, azadi, message, of, freedom, some, researchers, argue, that, the, notion, of, sociopolitical, ramifications, of, esthaetic, changes, led, to, the, idea, of, poets, as, social, leaders, trying, the, limits, and, possibilities, of, social, change, an, important, movement, in, modern, persian, literature, centered, on, the, question, of, modernization, and, westernization, and, whether, these, terms, are, synonymous, when, describing, the, evolution, of, iranian, society, it, can, be, argued, that, almost, all, advocates, of, modernism, in, persian, literature, from, akhundzadeh, kermani, and, malkom, khan, to, dehkhoda, aref, bahar, and, taqi, rafat, were, inspired, by, developments, and, changes, that, had, occurred, in, western, particularly, european, literatures, such, inspirations, did, not, mean, blindly, copying, western, models, but, rather, adapting, aspects, of, western, literature, and, changing, them, to, fit, the, needs, of, iranian, culture, following, the, pioneering, works, of, ahmad, kasravi, sadeq, hedayat, and, many, others, the,

mast, va, hoshyar, the, drunk, and, the, sober, won, admiration, from, many, of, those, involved, in, romantic, poetry, nima, yushij, is, considered, the, father, of, modern, persian, poetry, introducing, many, techniques, and, forms, to, differentiate, the, modern, from, the, old, nevertheless, the, credit, for, popularizing, this, new, literary, form, within, a, country, and, culture, solidly, based, on, a, thousand, years, of, classical, poetry, goes, to, his, few, disciples, such, as, ahmad, shamlou, who, adopted, nima, s, methods, and, tried, new, techniques, of, modern, poetry, the, transformation, brought, about, by, nima, youshij, who, freed, persian, poetry, from, the, fetters, of, prosodic, measures, was, a, turning, point, in, a, long, literary, tradition, it, broadened, the, perception, and, thinking, of, the, poets, that, came, after, him, nima, offered, a, different, understanding, of, the, principles, of, classical, poetry, his, artistry, was, not, confined, to, removing, the, need, for, a, fixed, length, hemistich, and, dispensing, with, the, tradition, of, rhyming, but, focused, on, a, broader, structure, and, function, based, on, a, contemporary, understanding, of, human, and, social, existence, his, aim, in, renovating, poetry, was, to, commit, it, to, a, natural, identity, and, to, achieve, a, modern, discipline, in, the, mind, and, linguistic, performance, of, the, poet, nima, held, that, the, formal, technique, dominating, classical, poetry, interfered, with, its, vitality, vigor, and, progress, although, he, accepted, some, of, its, aesthetic, properties, and, extended, them, in, his, poetry, he, never, ceased, to, widen, his, poetic, experience, by, emphasizing, the, natural, order, of, this, art, what, nima, youshij, founded, in, contemporary, poetry, his, successor, ahmad, shamlou, continued, the, sepid, poem, which, translates, to, white, poem, which, draws, its, sources, from, this, poet, avoided, the, compulsory, rules, which, had, entered, the, nimai, school, of, poetry, and, adopted, a, freer, structure, this, allowed, a, more, direct, relationship, between, the, poet, and, his, or, her, emotional, roots, in, previous, poetry, the, qualities, of, the, poet, s, vision, as, well, as, the, span, of, the, subject, could, only, be, expressed, in, general, terms, and, were, subsumed, by, the, formal, limitations, imposed, on, poetic, expression, nima, s, poetry, transgressed, these, limitations, it, relied, on, the, natural, function, inherent, within, poetry, itself, to, portray, the, poet, s, solidarity, with, life, and, the, wide, world, surrounding, him, or, her, in, specific, and, unambiguous, details, and, scenes, sepid, poetry, continues, the, poetic, vision, as, nima, expressed, it, and, avoids, the, contrived, rules, imposed, on, its, creation, however, its, most, distinct, difference, with, nimai, poetry, is, to, move, away, from, the, rhythms, it, employed, nima, youshij, paid, attention, to, an, overall, harmonious, rhyming, and, created, many, experimental, examples, to, achieve, this, end, ahmad, shamlu, discovered, the, inner, characteristics, of, poetry, and, its, manifestation, in, the, literary, creations, of, classical, masters, as, well, as, the, nimai, experience, he, offered, an, individual, approach, by, distancing, himself, from, the, obligations, imposed, by, older, poetry, and, some, of, the, limitations, that, had, entered, the, nimai, poem, he, recognized, the, role, of, prose, and, music, hidden, in, the, language, in, the, structure, of, sepid, poetry, in, contrast, to, the, prosodic, and, nimai, rules, the, poem, is, written, in, more, natural, words, and, incorporates, a, prose, like, process, without, losing, its, poetic, distinction, sepid, poetry, is, a, developing, branch, of, nimai, poetry, built, upon, nima, youshij, s, innovations, nima, thought, that, any, change, in, the, construction, and, the, tools, of, a, poet, s, expression, is, conditional, on, his, her, knowledge, of, the, world, and, a, revolutionized, outlook, sepid, poetry, could, not, take, root, outside, this, teaching, and, its, application, according, to, simin, behbahani, sepid, poetry, did, not, receive, general, acceptance, before, bijan, jalali, s, works, he, is, considered, the, founder, of, sepid, poetry, according, to, behbahani, behbahani, herself, used, the, char, pareh, style, of, nima, and, subsequently, turned, to, ghazal, a, free, flowing, poetry, style, similar, to, the, western, sonnet, simin, behbahani, contributed, to, a, historic, development, in, the, form, of, the, ghazal, as, she, added, theatrical, subjects, and, daily, events, and, conversations, into, her, poetry, she, has, expanded, the, range, of, traditional, persian, verse, forms, and, produced, some, of, the, most, significant, works, of, persian, literature, in, the, 20th, century, a, reluctant, follower, of, nima, yushij, mehdi, akhavan, sales, published, his, organ, 1951, to, support, contentions, against, nima, yushij, s, groundbreaking, endeavors, in, persian, poetry, mehdi, akhavan, sales, has, established, a, bridge, between, the, khorassani, and, nima, schools, the, critics, consider, mehdi, akhavan, sales, as, one, of, the, best, contemporary, persian, poets, he, is, one, of, the, pioneers, of, free, verse, new, style, poetry, in, persian, literature, particularly, of, modern, style, epics, it, was, his, ambition, for, a, long, time, to, introduce, a, fresh, style, to, persian, poetry, forough, farrokhzad, is, important, in, the, literary, history, of, iran, for, three, reasons, first, she, was, among, the, first, generation, to, embrace, the, new, style, of, poetry, pioneered, by, nima, yushij, during, the, 1920s, which, demanded, that, poets, experiment, with, rhyme, imagery, and, the, individual, voice, second, she, was, the, first, modern, iranian, woman, to, graphically, articulate, private, sexual, landscapes, from, a, woman, s, perspective, finally, she, transcended, her, own, literary, role, and, experimented, with, acting, painting, and, documentary, film, making, fereydoon, moshiri, is, best, known, as, conciliator, of, classical, persian, poetry, with, the, new, poetry, initiated, by, nima, yooshij, one, of, the, major, contributions, of, moshiri, s, poetry, according, to, some, observers, is, the, broadening, of, the, social, and, geographical, scope, of, modern, persian, literature, a, poet, of, the, last, generation, before, the, islamic, revolution, worthy, of, mention, is, mohammad, reza, shafiei, kadkani, m, sereshk, though, he, is, from, khorassan, and, sways, between, allegiance, to, nima, youshij, and, akhavan, saless, in, his, poetry, he, shows, the, influences, of, hafiz, and, mowlavi, he, uses, simple, lyrical, language, and, is, mostly, inspired, by, the, political, atmosphere, he, is, the, most, successful, of, those, poets, who, in, the, past, four, decades, have, tried, hard, to, find, a, synthesis, between, the, two, models, of, ahmad, shamloo, and, nima, youshij, in, the, twenty, first, century, a, new, generation, of, iranian, poets, continues, to, work, in, the, new, poetry, style, and, now, attracts, an, international, audience, thanks, to, efforts, to, translate, their, works, ditions, bruno, doucey, published, a,

progressive, evolution, called, postmodern, ghazal, begun, in, the, persian, poetry, leading, to, the, modern, poetry, that, changed, the, balancing, principle, of, rhythm, and, rhyme, of, the, traditional, persian, poetry, as, did, in, the, free, verse, poetry, following, the, rhythm, of, natural, speech, now, the, center, of, the, attention, was, language, alone, and, not, only, rhythm, was, absent, but, the, charm, of, language, leads, it, to, be, the, main, axle, pushing, the, persian, poetry, forward, the, three, most, talked, about, poets, of, the, post, modern, poetry, in, iran, are, reza, barahani, ali, abdolrezaei, and, ali, babachahi, among, them, ali, abdolrezaei, enjoyed, a, wider, admissibility, due, to, the, new, language, he, expressed, which, prevailed, in, that,
