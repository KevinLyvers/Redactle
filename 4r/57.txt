the, sydney, opera, house, is, a, multi, venue, performing, arts, centre, in, sydney, new, south, wales, australia, located, on, the, foreshore, of, sydney, harbour, it, is, widely, regarded, as, one, of, the, world, s, most, famous, and, distinctive, buildings, and, a, masterpiece, of, 20th, century, architecture, designed, by, danish, architect, j, rn, utzon, and, completed, by, an, australian, architectural, team, headed, by, peter, hall, the, building, was, formally, opened, by, queen, elizabeth, ii, on, 20, october, 1973, 16, years, after, utzon, s, 1957, selection, as, winner, of, an, international, design, competition, the, government, of, new, south, wales, led, by, the, premier, joseph, cahill, authorised, work, to, begin, in, 1958, with, utzon, directing, construction, the, government, s, decision, to, build, utzon, s, design, is, often, overshadowed, by, circumstances, that, followed, including, cost, and, scheduling, overruns, as, well, as, the, architect, s, ultimate, resignation, the, building, and, its, surrounds, occupy, the, whole, of, bennelong, point, on, sydney, harbour, between, sydney, cove, and, farm, cove, adjacent, to, the, sydney, central, business, district, and, the, royal, botanic, gardens, and, near, to, the, sydney, harbour, bridge, the, building, comprises, multiple, performance, venues, which, together, host, well, over, 1, 500, performances, annually, attended, by, more, than, 1, 2, million, people, performances, are, presented, by, numerous, performing, artists, with, many, resident, companies, such, as, opera, australia, the, sydney, theatre, company, and, the, sydney, symphony, orchestra, as, one, of, the, most, popular, visitor, attractions, in, australia, the, site, is, visited, by, more, than, eight, million, people, annually, and, approximately, 350, 000, visitors, take, a, guided, tour, of, the, building, each, year, the, building, is, managed, by, the, sydney, opera, house, trust, an, agency, of, the, new, south, wales, state, government, on, 28, june, 1998, the, sydney, opera, house, became, a, unesco, world, heritage, site, having, been, listed, on, the, now, defunct, register, of, the, national, estate, since, 1980, the, national, trust, of, australia, register, since, 1983, the, city, of, sydney, heritage, inventory, since, 2000, the, new, south, wales, state, heritage, register, since, 2003, and, the, australian, national, heritage, list, since, 2005, the, opera, house, was, also, a, finalist, in, the, new7wonders, of, the, world, campaign, list, the, facility, features, a, modern, expressionist, design, with, a, series, of, large, precast, concrete, shells, each, composed, of, sections, of, a, sphere, of, 75, 2, metres, 246, ft, 8, 6, in, radius, forming, the, roofs, of, the, structure, set, on, a, monumental, podium, the, building, covers, 1, 8, hectares, 4, 4, acres, of, land, and, is, 183, m, 600, ft, long, and, 120, m, 394, ft, wide, at, its, widest, point, it, is, supported, on, 588, concrete, piers, sunk, as, much, as, 25, m, 82, ft, below, sea, level, the, highest, roof, point, is, 67, metres, above, sea, level, which, is, the, same, height, as, that, of, a, 22, storey, building, the, roof, is, made, of, 2, 194, pre, cast, concrete, sections, which, weigh, up, to, 15, tonnes, each, although, the, roof, structures, are, commonly, referred, to, as, shells, as, in, this, article, they, are, precast, concrete, panels, supported, by, precast, concrete, ribs, not, shells, in, a, strictly, structural, sense, though, the, shells, appear, uniformly, white, from, a, distance, they, actually, feature, a, subtle, chevron, pattern, composed, of, 1, 056, 006, tiles, in, two, colours, glossy, white, and, matte, cream, the, tiles, were, manufactured, by, the, swedish, company, h, gan, s, ab, which, generally, produced, stoneware, tiles, for, the, paper, mill, industry, apart, from, the, tile, of, the, shells, and, the, glass, curtain, walls, of, the, foyer, spaces, the, building, s, exterior, is, largely, clad, with, aggregate, panels, composed, of, pink, granite, quarried, at, tarana, significant, interior, surface, treatments, also, include, off, form, concrete, australian, white, birch, plywood, supplied, from, wauchope, in, northern, new, south, wales, and, brush, box, glulam, of, the, two, larger, spaces, the, concert, hall, is, in, the, western, group, of, shells, the, joan, sutherland, theatre, in, the, eastern, group, the, scale, of, the, shells, was, chosen, to, reflect, the, internal, height, requirements, with, low, entrance, spaces, rising, over, the, seating, areas, up, to, the, high, stage, towers, the, smaller, venues, the, drama, theatre, the, playhouse, and, the, studio, are, within, the, podium, beneath, the, concert, hall, a, smaller, group, of, shells, set, to, the, western, side, of, the, monumental, steps, houses, the, bennelong, restaurant, the, podium, is, surrounded, by, substantial, open, public, spaces, and, the, large, stone, paved, forecourt, area, with, the, adjacent, monumental, steps, is, regularly, used, as, a, performance, space, the, sydney, opera, house, includes, a, number, of, performance, venues, other, areas, for, example, the, northern, and, western, foyers, are, also, used, for, performances, on, an, occasional, basis, venues, are, also, used, for, conferences, ceremonies, and, social, functions, the, building, also, houses, a, recording, studio, retail, shops, cafes, restaurants, bars, including, the, opera, bar, and, opera, kitchen, guided, tours, are, available, including, a, frequent, tour, of, the, front, of, house, spaces, and, a, daily, backstage, tour, that, takes, visitors, backstage, to, see, areas, normally, reserved, for, performers, and, crew, members, planning, began, in, the, late, 1940s, when, eugene, goossens, the, director, of, the, new, south, wales, state, conservatorium, of, music, lobbied, for, a, suitable, venue, for, large, theatrical, productions, the, normal, venue, for, such, productions, the, sydney, town, hall, was, not, considered, large, enough, by, 1954, goossens, succeeded, in, gaining, the, support, of, new, south, wales, premier, joseph, cahill, who, called, for, designs, for, a, dedicated, opera, house, it, was, also, goossens, who, insisted, that, bennelong, point, be, the, site, cahill, had, wanted, it, to, be, on, or, near, wynyard, railway, station, in, the, northwest, of, the, central, business, district, an, international, design, competition, was, launched, by, cahill, on, 13, september, 1955, and, received, 233, entries, representing, architects, from, 32, countries, the, criteria, specified, a, large, hall, seating, 3, 000, and, a, small, hall, for, 1, 200, people, each, to, be, designed, for, different, uses, including, full, scale, operas, orchestral, and, choral, concerts, mass, meetings, lectures, ballet, performances, and, other, presentations, the, jury, for, the, competition, were, professor, henry, ashworth, university, of, sydney, cobden, parkes, new, south, wales, government, architect, professor, leslie, martin, professor, of, architecture, of, cambridge, university, and, architect, of, royal, festival, hall, 1951, and, american, architect, eero, saarinen, the, winner, announced, in, sydney, on, 29, january, 1957, was, danish, architect, j, rn, utzon, utzon, s, design, was, selected, by, finnish, american, architect, eero, saarinen, from, a, final, cut, of, 30, rejects, the, runner, up, was, a, philadelphia, based, team, assembled, by, robert, geddes, and, george, qualls, both, teaching, at, the, university, of, pennsylvania, school, of, design, they, brought, together, a, band, of, penn, faculty, and, friends, from, philadelphia, architectural, offices, including, melvin, brecher, warren, cunningham, joseph, marzella, walter, wiseman, and, leon, loschetter, geddes, brecher, qualls, and, cunningham, went, on, to, found, the, firm, gbqc, architects, the, grand, prize, was, 5, 000, australian, pounds, utzon, visited, sydney, in, 1957, to, help, supervise, the, project, his, office, moved, to, palm, beach, sydney, in, february, 1963, utzon, received, the, pritzker, architecture, prize, architecture, s, highest, honour, in, 2003, the, pritzker, prize, citation, read, there, is, no, doubt, that, the, sydney, opera, house, is, his, masterpiece, it, is, one, of, the, great, iconic, buildings, of, the, 20th, century, an, image, of, great, beauty, that, has, become, known, throughout, the, world, a, symbol, for, not, only, a, city, but, a, whole, country, and, continent, the, fort, macquarie, tram, depot, occupying, the, site, at, the, time, of, these, plans, was, demolished, in, 1958, and, construction, began, in, march, 1959, the, opera, house, was, built, in, four, stages, stage, i, 1957, 1959, was, planning, out, the, building, stage, ii, 1959, 1963, consisted, of, building, the, upper, podium, stage, iii, 1963, 1967, the, construction, of, the, outer, shells, based, upon, the, image, of, whales, breaching, the, water, stage, iv, 1967, 1973, interior, design, and, construction, stage, i, started, on, 2, march, 1959, with, the, construction, firm, civil, civic, monitored, by, the, engineers, ove, arup, and, partners, the, government, had, pushed, for, work, to, begin, early, fearing, that, funding, or, public, opinion, might, turn, against, them, but, utzon, had, still, not, completed, the, final, designs, major, structural, issues, still, remained, unresolved, by, 23, january, 1961, work, was, running, 47, weeks, behind, mainly, because, of, unexpected, difficulties, inclement, weather, unexpected, difficulty, diverting, stormwater, construction, beginning, before, proper, construction, drawings, had, been, prepared, changes, of, original, contract, documents, work, on, the, podium, was, finally, completed, in, february, 1963, the, forced, early, start, led, to, significant, later, problems, not, least, of, which, was, that, the, podium, columns, were, not, strong, enough, to, support, the, roof, structure, and, had, to, be, re, built, the, shells, of, the, competition, entry, were, originally, of, undefined, geometry, but, early, in, the, design, process, the, shells, were, perceived, as, a, series, of, parabolas, supported, by, precast, concrete, ribs, however, engineers, ove, arup, and, partners, were, unable, to, find, an, acceptable, solution, to, constructing, them, the, formwork, for, using, in, situ, concrete, would, have, been, prohibitively, expensive, and, because, there, was, no, repetition, in, any, of, the, roof, forms, the, construction, of, precast, concrete, for, each, individual, section, would, possibly, have, been, even, more, expensive, from, 1957, to, 1963, the, design, team, went, through, at, least, 12, iterations, of, the, form, of, the, shells, trying, to, find, an, economically, acceptable, form, including, schemes, with, parabolas, circular, ribs, and, ellipsoids, before, a, workable, solution, was, completed, the, design, work, on, the, shells, involved, one, of, the, earliest, uses, of, computers, in, structural, analysis, to, understand, the, complex, forces, to, which, the, shells, would, be, subjected, the, computer, system, was, also, used, in, the, assembly, of, the, arches, the, pins, in, the, arches, were, surveyed, at, the, end, of, each, day, and, the, information, was, entered, into, the, computer, so, the, next, arch, could, be, properly, placed, the, following, day, in, mid, 1961, the, design, team, found, a, solution, to, the, problem, the, shells, all, being, created, as, sections, from, a, sphere, this, solution, allows, arches, of, varying, length, to, be, cast, in, a, common, mould, and, a, number, of, arch, segments, of, common, length, to, be, placed, adjacent, to, one, another, to, form, a, spherical, section, with, whom, exactly, this, solution, originated, has, been, the, subject, of, some, controversy, it, was, originally, credited, to, utzon, ove, arup, s, letter, to, ashworth, a, member, of, the, sydney, opera, house, executive, committee, states, utzon, came, up, with, an, idea, of, making, all, the, shells, of, uniform, curvature, throughout, in, both, directions, peter, jones, the, author, of, ove, arup, s, biography, states, that, the, architect, and, his, supporters, alike, claimed, to, recall, the, precise, eureka, moment, the, engineers, and, some, of, their, associates, with, equal, conviction, recall, discussion, in, both, central, london, and, at, ove, s, house, he, goes, on, to, claim, that, the, existing, evidence, shows, that, arup, s, canvassed, several, possibilities, for, the, geometry, of, the, shells, from, parabolas, to, ellipsoids, and, spheres, yuzo, mikami, a, member, of, the, design, team, presents, an, opposite, view, in, his, book, on, the, project, utzon, s, sphere, it, is, unlikely, that, the, truth, will, ever, be, categorically, known, but, there, is, a, clear, consensus, that, the, design, team, worked, very, well, indeed, for, the, first, part, of, the, project, and, that, utzon, arup, and, ronald, jenkins, partner, of, ove, arup, and, partners, responsible, for, the, opera, house, project, all, played, a, very, significant, part, in, the, design, development, as, peter, murray, states, in, the, saga, of, the, sydney, opera, house, the, two, men, and, their, teams, enjoyed, a, collaboration, that, was, remarkable, in, its, fruitfulness, and, despite, many, traumas, was, seen, by, most, of, those, involved, in, the, project, as, a, high, point, of, architect, engineer, collaboration, the, design, of, the, roof, was, tested, on, scale, models, in, wind, tunnels, at, university, of, southampton, and, later, npl, to, establish, the, wind, pressure, distribution, around, the, roof, shape, in, very, high, winds, which, helped, in, the, design, of, the, roof, tiles, and, their, fixtures, the, immensely, complex, design, and, construction, of, the, shells, was, completed, by, hornibrook, group, pty, ltd, who, were, also, responsible, for, construction, in, stage, iii, hornibrook, manufactured, the, 2400, precast, ribs, and, 4000, roof, panels, in, an, on, site, factory, and, also, developed, the, construction, processes, the, achievement, of, this, solution, avoided, the, need, for, expensive, formwork, construction, by, allowing, the, use, of, precast, units, and, it, also, allowed, the, roof, tiles, to, be, prefabricated, in, sheets, on, the, ground, instead, of, being, stuck, on, individually, at, height, the, tiles, themselves, were, manufactured, by, the, swedish, company, h, gan, s, keramik, it, took, three, years, of, development, to, produce, the, effect, utzon, wanted, in, what, became, known, as, the, sydney, tile, 120mm, square, it, is, made, from, clay, with, a, small, percentage, of, crushed, stone, ove, arup, and, partners, site, engineer, supervised, the, construction, of, the, shells, which, used, an, innovative, adjustable, steel, trussed, erection, arch, developed, by, hornibrook, s, engineer, joe, bertony, to, support, the, different, roofs, before, completion, on, 6, april, 1962, it, was, estimated, that, the, opera, house, would, be, completed, between, august, 1964, and, march, 1965, stage, iii, the, interiors, started, with, utzon, moving, his, entire, office, to, sydney, in, february, 1963, however, there, was, a, change, of, government, in, 1965, and, the, new, robert, askin, government, declared, the, project, under, the, jurisdiction, of, the, ministry, of, public, works, due, to, the, ministry, s, criticism, of, the, project, s, costs, and, time, along, with, their, impression, of, utzon, s, designs, being, impractical, this, ultimately, led, to, his, resignation, in, 1966, see, below, the, cost, of, the, project, so, far, even, in, october, 1966, was, still, only, a, 22, 9, million, less, than, a, quarter, of, the, final, 102, million, cost, however, the, projected, costs, for, the, design, were, at, this, stage, much, more, significant, the, second, stage, of, construction, was, progressing, toward, completion, when, utzon, resigned, his, position, was, principally, taken, over, by, peter, hall, who, became, largely, responsible, for, the, interior, design, other, persons, appointed, that, same, year, to, replace, utzon, were, e, h, farmer, as, government, architect, d, s, littlemore, and, lionel, todd, following, utzon, s, resignation, the, acoustic, advisor, lothar, cremer, confirmed, to, the, sydney, opera, house, executive, committee, sohec, that, utzon, s, original, acoustic, design, allowed, for, only, 2, 000, seats, in, the, main, hall, and, further, stated, that, increasing, the, number, of, seats, to, 3, 000, as, specified, in, the, brief, would, be, disastrous, for, the, acoustics, according, to, peter, jones, the, stage, designer, martin, carr, criticised, the, shape, height, and, width, of, the, stage, the, physical, facilities, for, artists, the, location, of, the, dressing, rooms, the, widths, of, doors, and, lifts, and, the, location, of, lighting, switchboards, the, opera, house, was, formally, completed, in, 1973, having, cost, 102, million, h, r, sam, hoare, the, hornibrook, director, in, charge, of, the, project, provided, the, following, approximations, in, 1973, stage, i, podium, civil, civic, pty, ltd, approximately, 5, 5m, stage, ii, roof, shells, m, r, hornibrook, nsw, pty, ltd, approximately, 12, 5m, stage, iii, completion, the, hornibrook, group, 56, 5m, separate, contracts, stage, equipment, stage, lighting, and, organ, 9, 0m, fees, and, other, costs, 16, 5m, the, original, cost, and, scheduling, estimates, in, 1957, projected, a, cost, of, 3, 500, 000, 7, million, and, completion, date, of, 26, january, 1963, australia, day, in, reality, the, project, was, completed, ten, years, late, and, 1, 357, over, budget, in, real, terms, in, 1972, a, construction, worker, was, fired, leading, the, blf, affiliated, workers, to, demand, his, rehiring, and, a, 25, wage, increase, in, response, to, this, all, the, workers, were, fired, and, in, revenge, the, workers, broke, into, the, construction, site, with, a, crowbar, and, brought, their, own, toolboxes, workers, control, was, applied, to, the, site, for, five, weeks, as, the, construction, workers, worked, 35, hours, a, week, with, improved, morale, more, efficient, organization, and, fewer, people, skipping, work, the, workers, agreed, to, end, their, work, in, when, management, agreed, to, give, them, a, 25, wage, increase, the, right, to, elect, their, foremen, four, weeks, annual, leave, and, a, large, payment, for, their, troubles, before, the, sydney, opera, house, competition, j, rn, utzon, had, won, seven, of, the, 18, competitions, he, had, entered, but, had, never, seen, any, of, his, designs, built, utzon, s, submitted, concept, for, the, sydney, opera, house, was, almost, universally, admired, and, considered, groundbreaking, the, assessors, report, of, january, 1957, stated, the, drawings, submitted, for, this, scheme, are, simple, to, the, point, of, being, diagrammatic, nevertheless, as, we, have, returned, again, and, again, to, the, study, of, these, drawings, we, are, convinced, that, they, present, a, concept, of, an, opera, house, which, is, capable, of, becoming, one, of, the, great, buildings, of, the, world, for, the, first, stage, utzon, worked, successfully, with, the, rest, of, the, design, team, and, the, client, but, as, the, project, progressed, the, cahill, government, insisted, on, progressive, revisions, they, also, did, not, fully, appreciate, the, costs, or, work, involved, in, design, and, construction, tensions, between, the, client, and, the, design, team, grew, further, when, an, early, start, to, construction, was, demanded, despite, an, incomplete, design, this, resulted, in, a, continuing, series, of, delays, and, setbacks, while, various, technical, engineering, issues, were, being, refined, the, building, was, unique, and, the, problems, with, the, design, issues, and, cost, increases, were, exacerbated, by, commencement, of, work, before, the, completion, of, the, final, plans, after, the, 1965, election, of, the, liberal, party, with, robert, askin, becoming, premier, of, new, south, wales, the, relationship, of, client, architect, engineers, and, contractors, became, increasingly, tense, askin, had, been, a, vocal, critic, of, the, project, prior, to, gaining, office, his, new, minister, for, public, works, davis, hughes, was, even, less, sympathetic, elizabeth, farrelly, an, australian, architecture, critic, wrote, that, at, an, election, night, dinner, party, in, mosman, hughes, daughter, sue, burgoyne, boasted, that, her, father, would, soon, sack, utzon, hughes, had, no, interest, in, art, architecture, or, aesthetics, a, fraud, as, well, as, a, philistine, he, had, been, exposed, before, parliament, and, dumped, as, country, party, leader, for, 19, years, of, falsely, claiming, a, university, degree, the, opera, house, gave, hughes, a, second, chance, for, him, as, for, utzon, it, was, all, about, control, about, the, triumph, of, homegrown, mediocrity, over, foreign, genius, differences, ensued, one, of, the, first, was, that, utzon, believed, the, clients, should, receive, information, on, all, aspects, of, the, design, and, construction, through, his, practice, while, the, clients, wanted, a, system, notably, drawn, in, sketch, form, by, davis, hughes, where, architect, contractors, and, engineers, each, reported, to, the, client, directly, and, separately, this, had, great, implications, for, procurement, methods, and, cost, control, with, utzon, wishing, to, negotiate, contracts, with, chosen, suppliers, such, as, ralph, symonds, for, the, plywood, interiors, and, the, new, south, wales, government, insisting, contracts, be, put, out, to, tender, utzon, was, highly, reluctant, to, respond, to, questions, or, criticism, from, the, client, s, sydney, opera, house, executive, committee, sohec, however, he, was, greatly, supported, throughout, by, a, member, of, the, committee, and, one, of, the, original, competition, judges, harry, ingham, ashworth, utzon, was, unwilling, to, compromise, on, some, aspects, of, his, designs, that, the, clients, wanted, to, change, utzon, s, ability, was, never, in, doubt, despite, questions, raised, by, davis, hughes, who, attempted, to, portray, utzon, as, an, impractical, dreamer, ove, arup, actually, stated, that, utzon, was, probably, the, best, of, any, i, have, come, across, in, my, long, experience, of, working, with, architects, and, the, opera, house, could, become, the, world, s, foremost, contemporary, masterpiece, if, utzon, is, given, his, head, in, 1965, utzon, was, working, closely, with, ralph, symonds, a, manufacturer, of, plywood, based, in, sydney, and, highly, regarded, by, many, despite, an, arup, engineer, warning, that, ralph, symonds, s, knowledge, of, the, design, stresses, of, plywood, was, extremely, sketchy, and, that, the, technical, advice, was, elementary, to, say, the, least, and, completely, useless, for, our, purposes, australian, architecture, critic, elizabeth, farrelly, has, referred, to, ove, arup, s, project, engineer, michael, lewis, as, having, other, agendas, by, february, 1966, utzon, was, owed, more, than, 100, 000, in, fees, hughes, then, withheld, funding, so, that, utzon, could, not, even, pay, his, own, staff, the, government, minutes, record, that, following, several, threats, of, resignation, utzon, finally, stated, to, davis, hughes, if, you, don, t, do, it, i, resign, hughes, replied, i, accept, your, resignation, thank, you, very, much, goodbye, utzon, left, the, project, on, 28, february, 1966, he, said, that, hughes, s, refusal, to, pay, him, any, fees, and, the, lack, of, collaboration, caused, his, resignation, and, later, described, the, situation, as, malice, in, blunderland, in, march, 1966, hughes, offered, him, a, subordinate, role, as, design, architect, under, a, panel, of, executive, architects, without, any, supervisory, powers, over, the, house, s, construction, but, utzon, rejected, this, utzon, left, the, country, never, to, return, following, the, resignation, there, was, great, controversy, about, who, was, in, the, right, and, who, was, in, the, wrong, the, sydney, morning, herald, initially, opined, no, architect, in, the, world, has, enjoyed, greater, freedom, than, mr, utzon, few, clients, have, been, more, patient, or, more, generous, than, the, people, and, the, government, of, nsw, one, would, not, like, history, to, record, that, this, partnership, was, brought, to, an, end, by, a, fit, of, temper, on, the, one, side, or, by, a, fit, of, meanness, on, the, other, on, 17, march, 1966, the, herald, offered, the, view, that, it, was, not, his, fault, that, a, succession, of, governments, and, the, opera, house, trust, should, so, signally, have,
