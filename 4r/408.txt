the, well, tempered, clavier, bwv, 846, 893, consists, of, two, sets, of, preludes, and, fugues, in, all, 24, major, and, minor, keys, for, keyboard, by, johann, sebastian, bach, in, the, composer, s, time, clavier, referred, to, a, variety, of, keyboard, instruments, namely, the, harpsichord, the, clavichord, and, the, organ, the, modern, german, spelling, for, the, collection, is, das, wohltemperierte, klavier, wtk, german, pronunciation, bach, gave, the, title, das, wohltemperirte, clavier, to, a, book, of, preludes, and, fugues, in, all, 24, keys, major, and, minor, dated, 1722, composed, for, the, profit, and, use, of, musical, youth, desirous, of, learning, and, especially, for, the, pastime, of, those, already, skilled, in, this, study, some, 20, years, later, bach, compiled, a, second, book, of, the, same, kind, 24, pairs, of, preludes, and, fugues, which, became, known, as, the, well, tempered, clavier, part, two, in, german, zweyter, theil, modern, spelling, zweiter, teil, modern, editions, usually, refer, to, both, parts, as, the, well, tempered, clavier, book, 1, wtc, 1, and, the, well, tempered, clavier, book, 2, wtc, 2, respectively, the, collection, is, generally, regarded, as, one, of, the, most, important, works, in, the, history, of, classical, music, each, set, contains, 24, pairs, of, prelude, and, fugue, the, first, pair, is, in, c, major, the, second, in, c, minor, the, third, in, c, major, the, fourth, in, c, minor, and, so, on, the, rising, chromatic, pattern, continues, until, every, key, has, been, represented, finishing, with, a, b, minor, fugue, the, first, set, was, compiled, in, 1722, during, bach, s, appointment, in, k, then, and, the, second, followed, 20, years, later, in, 1742, while, he, was, in, leipzig, bach, recycled, some, of, the, preludes, and, fugues, from, earlier, sources, the, 1720, klavierb, chlein, f, r, wilhelm, friedemann, bach, for, instance, contains, versions, of, eleven, of, the, preludes, of, the, first, book, of, the, well, tempered, clavier, the, c, major, prelude, and, fugue, in, book, one, was, originally, in, c, major, bach, added, a, key, signature, of, seven, sharps, and, adjusted, some, accidentals, to, convert, it, to, the, required, key, in, bach, s, own, time, just, one, similar, collection, was, published, by, johann, christian, schickhardt, 1681, 1762, whose, op, 30, l, alphabet, de, la, musique, circa, 1735, contained, 24, sonatas, in, all, keys, for, flute, or, violin, and, basso, continuo, and, included, a, transposition, scheme, for, alto, recorder, although, the, well, tempered, clavier, was, the, first, collection, of, fully, worked, keyboard, pieces, in, all, 24, keys, similar, ideas, had, occurred, earlier, before, the, advent, of, modern, tonality, in, the, late, 17th, century, numerous, composers, produced, collections, of, pieces, in, all, seven, modes, johann, pachelbel, s, magnificat, fugues, composed, 1695, 1706, georg, muffat, s, apparatus, musico, organisticus, of, 1690, and, johann, speth, s, ars, magna, of, 1693, for, example, furthermore, some, two, hundred, years, before, bach, s, time, equal, temperament, was, realized, on, plucked, string, instruments, such, as, the, lute, and, the, theorbo, resulting, in, several, collections, of, pieces, in, all, keys, although, the, music, was, not, yet, tonal, in, the, modern, sense, of, the, word, one, of, the, earliest, keyboard, composers, to, realize, a, collection, of, organ, pieces, in, successive, keys, was, daniel, croner, 1656, 1740, who, compiled, one, such, cycle, of, preludes, in, 1682, his, contemporary, johann, heinrich, kittel, 1652, 1682, also, composed, a, cycle, of, 12, organ, preludes, in, successive, keys, j, c, f, fischer, s, ariadne, musica, neo, organoedum, published, in, 1702, and, reissued, 1715, is, a, set, of, 20, prelude, and, fugue, pairs, in, ten, major, and, nine, minor, keys, and, the, phrygian, mode, plus, five, chorale, based, ricercars, bach, knew, the, collection, and, borrowed, some, of, the, themes, from, fischer, for, the, well, tempered, clavier, other, contemporary, works, include, the, treatise, exemplarische, organisten, probe, 1719, by, johann, mattheson, 1681, 1764, which, included, 48, figured, bass, exercises, in, all, keys, partien, auf, das, clavier, 1718, by, christoph, graupner, 1683, 1760, with, eight, suites, in, successive, keys, and, friedrich, suppig, s, fantasia, from, labyrinthus, musicus, 1722, a, long, and, formulaic, sectional, composition, ranging, through, all, 24, keys, which, was, intended, for, an, enharmonic, keyboard, with, both, 31, notes, per, octave, and, pure, major, thirds, finally, a, lost, collection, by, johann, pachelbel, 1653, 1706, fugen, und, praeambuln, ber, die, gew, hnlichsten, tonos, figuratos, announced, 1704, may, have, included, prelude, fugue, pairs, in, all, keys, or, modes, it, was, long, believed, that, bach, had, taken, the, title, the, well, tempered, clavier, from, a, similarly, named, set, of, 24, preludes, and, fugues, in, all, the, keys, for, which, a, manuscript, dated, 1689, was, found, in, the, library, of, the, brussels, conservatoire, it, was, later, shown, that, this, was, the, work, of, a, composer, who, was, not, even, born, in, 1689, bernhard, christian, weber, 1, december, 1712, 5, february, 1758, in, fact, it, was, written, in, 1745, 1750, in, imitation, of, bach, s, prior, example, bach, s, title, suggests, that, he, had, written, for, a, 12, note, tuning, system, in, which, all, keys, sounded, in, tune, called, a, circulating, temperament, or, a, well, temperament, one, of, the, opposing, systems, in, bach, s, day, was, meantone, temperament, in, which, keys, with, many, accidentals, sound, out, of, tune, on, keyboards, limited, to, 12, pitches, per, octave, bach, would, have, been, familiar, with, different, tuning, systems, and, in, particular, as, an, organist, would, have, played, instruments, tuned, to, a, meantone, system, during, much, of, the, 20th, century, it, was, presumed, possibly, mistakenly, that, bach, intended, equal, temperament, after, bach, s, death, it, became, popular, as, the, standard, keyboard, tuning, and, had, been, described, by, theorists, and, musicians, for, at, least, a, century, before, bach, s, birth, evidence, for, this, belief, is, found, in, the, fact, that, in, w, t, c, book, 1, bach, paired, the, e, minor, prelude, 6, flats, with, its, enharmonic, key, of, d, minor, 6, sharps, for, the, following, fugue, this, pairs, the, most, tonally, remote, enharmonic, keys, at, the, point, opposite, c, major, on, the, circle, of, fifths, where, the, flat, arm, and, sharp, arm, cross, each, other, any, unbroken, performance, of, the, pair, would, have, required, both, of, these, enharmonic, keys, to, sound, identically, tuned, implying, equal, temperament, for, this, pair, as, musicologists, expect, the, entire, piece, to, be, played, as, a, single, performance, accounts, of, bach, s, own, tuning, practice, are, few, and, inexact, the, three, most, cited, sources, are, forkel, bach, s, first, biographer, friedrich, wilhelm, marpurg, who, received, information, from, bach, s, sons, and, pupils, and, johann, kirnberger, one, of, those, pupils, despite, the, presumption, of, equal, temperament, research, has, continued, into, various, unequal, systems, contemporary, with, bach, s, career, there, is, debate, whether, bach, might, have, meant, a, range, of, similar, temperaments, perhaps, altered, slightly, in, practice, from, piece, to, piece, or, possibly, some, single, specific, well, tempered, solution, for, all, purposes, modern, scholars, suggest, some, form, of, unequal, well, temperament, instead, of, equal, temperament, forkel, reports, that, bach, tuned, his, own, harpsichords, and, clavichords, and, found, other, people, s, tunings, unsatisfactory, and, also, that, bach, s, personal, tuning, system, allowed, him, to, play, in, all, keys, and, to, modulate, into, distant, keys, almost, without, the, listeners, noticing, in, the, course, of, a, heated, debate, marpurg, and, kirnberger, appear, to, agree, that, bach, required, all, the, major, thirds, to, be, sharper, than, pure, which, is, not, very, informative, since, it, is, essentially, a, prerequisite, for, any, temperament, to, sound, tolerable, in, all, keys, johann, georg, neidhardt, writing, in, 1724, 1732, described, a, range, of, unequal, and, near, equal, temperaments, as, well, as, equal, temperament, itself, which, can, be, successfully, used, to, perform, some, of, bach, s, music, and, were, later, praised, by, some, of, bach, s, pupils, and, associates, j, s, bach, s, son, carl, philipp, emanuel, bach, himself, published, a, rather, vague, tuning, method, which, was, close, to, but, still, not, equal, temperament, he, wrote, that, it, had, only, most, of, the, fifths, tempered, without, saying, which, ones, nor, by, how, much, since, 1950, there, have, been, many, other, proposals, and, many, performances, of, the, work, in, different, and, unequal, tunings, some, derived, from, historical, sources, some, by, modern, authors, whatever, their, provenances, these, schemes, all, promote, the, existence, of, subtly, different, musical, characters, in, different, keys, due, to, the, sizes, of, their, intervals, however, they, disagree, as, to, which, key, receives, which, character, more, recently, there, has, been, a, series, of, proposals, of, temperaments, derived, from, the, handwritten, doodle, of, loops, on, the, title, page, of, bach, s, personal, 1722, manuscript, nevertheless, some, musicologists, say, there, is, insufficient, proof, that, bach, s, looped, drawing, signifies, anything, reliable, about, a, tuning, method, bach, may, have, tuned, differently, per, occasion, or, per, composition, throughout, his, career, swich, s, proposal, is, based, on, the, equal, timing, of, the, beats, between, the, fifth, f, c, and, the, third, f, a, c, 3, beats, per, second, and, between, the, fifth, c, g, and, the, third, c, e, c, 2, beats, per, second, such, a, system, is, reminiscent, of, kellner, s, 1977, temperament, and, even, more, closely, to, the, temperament, used, for, the, organ, of, st, ludgeri, in, norden, built, in, 1688, by, arp, schnitger, and, the, temperament, later, described, by, carlo, gervasoni, 1800, a, system, like, swich, s, with, all, its, major, thirds, more, or, less, sharp, is, confirmed, by, friedrich, wilhelm, marpurg, s, description, of, the, way, bach, s, famous, student, j, p, kirnberger, was, taught, to, tune, in, his, lessons, with, bach, kirnberger, s, tuning, allows, all, 24, keys, to, be, played, through, without, changing, tuning, nor, unpleasant, intervals, but, with, varying, degrees, of, difference, the, temperament, is, unequal, and, the, keys, do, not, all, sound, the, same, compared, to, werckmeister, iii, the, other, 24, key, circulating, temperaments, kirnberger, s, version, of, bach, s, tuning, is, much, more, differentiated, with, its, 8, different, kinds, of, major, thirds, instead, of, werckmeister, s, 4, the, manuscript, bach, p415, in, the, berlin, state, library, is, the, only, known, copy, of, the, w, t, c, that, shows, the, doodle, it, would, be, a, too, bit, cryptic, for, bach, s, spirit, but, seems, to, the, hopeful, to, represent, the, purpose, for, which, the, masterpiece, was, written, and, at, the, same, time, a, clue, to, its, decipherment, in, perspective, this, is, not, surprising, since, the, document, with, the, doodle, is, most, probably, the, working, copy, johann, sebastian, bach, used, in, classes, with, his, students, each, prelude, is, followed, by, a, fugue, in, the, same, key, in, each, book, the, first, prelude, and, fugue, is, in, c, major, followed, by, a, prelude, and, fugue, in, its, parallel, minor, key, c, minor, then, all, keys, each, major, key, followed, by, its, parallel, minor, key, are, followed, through, each, time, moving, up, a, half, tone, c, c, d, e, e, f, f, ending, with, b, b, the, first, book, of, the, well, tempered, clavier, was, composed, in, the, early, 1720s, with, bach, s, autograph, dated, 1722, apart, from, the, early, versions, of, several, preludes, included, in, w, f, bach, s, klavierb, chlein, 1720, there, is, an, almost, complete, collection, of, prelude, and, fughetta, versions, predating, the, 1722, autograph, known, from, a, later, copy, by, an, unidentified, scribe, the, title, page, of, the, first, book, of, the,

seemingly, simple, progression, of, arpeggiated, chords, one, of, the, connotations, of, pr, luder, as, the, french, lutenists, used, it, to, test, the, tuning, bach, used, both, g, and, a, into, the,

free, coda, e, g, book, 1, preludes, in, c, minor, d, major, and, b, major, the, preludes, are, also, notable, for, their, odd, or, irregular, numbers, of, measures, in, terms, of, both, the, phrases, and, the, total, number, of, measures, in, a, given, prelude, each, fugue, is, marked, with, the, number, of, voices, from, two, to, five, most, are, three, and, four, voiced, fugues, but, two, are, five, voiced, the, fugues, in, c, minor, and, b, minor, from, book, 1, and, one, is, two, voiced, the, fugue, in, e, minor, from, book, 1, the, fugues, employ, a, full, range, of, contrapuntal, devices, fugal, exposition, thematic, inversion, stretto, etc, but, are, generally, more, compact, than, bach, s, fugues, for, organ, several, attempts, have, been, made, to, analyse, the, motivic, connections, between, each, prelude, and, fugue, most, notably, wilhelm, werker, and, johann, nepomuk, david, the, most, direct, motivic, reference, appears, in, the, b, major, set, from, book, 1, in, which, the, fugue, subject, uses, the, first, four, notes, of, the, prelude, in, the, same, metric, position, but, at, half, speed, both, books, of, the, well, tempered, clavier, were, widely, circulated, in, manuscript, but, printed, copies, were, not, made, until, 1801, by, three, publishers, almost, simultaneously, in, bonn, leipzig, and, zurich, bach, s, style, went, out, of, favour, in, the, time, around, his, death, and, most, music, in, the, early, classical, period, had, neither, contrapuntal, complexity, nor, a, great, variety, of, keys, but, with, the, maturing, of, the, classical, style, in, the, 1770s, the, well, tempered, clavier, began, to, influence, the, course, of, musical, history, with, haydn, and, mozart, studying, the, work, closely, mozart, transcribed, some, of, the, fugues, of, the, well, tempered, clavier, for, string, ensemble, fantasy, no, 1, with, fugue, k, 394, is, one, of, mozart, s, own, compositions, showing, the, influence, the, well, tempered, clavier, had, on, him, beethoven, played, the, entire, well, tempered, clavier, by, the, time, he, was, eleven, and, produced, an, arrangement, of, bwv, 867, for, string, quintet, hans, von, b, low, called, the, well, tempered, clavier, the, old, testament, of, music, the, beethoven, sonatas, were, the, new, testament, in, the, liner, notes, to, the, clair, de, lune, compilation, of, piano, encores, issued, by, cbs, masterworks, philippe, entremont, relates, an, anecdote, in, which, von, b, low, having, a, distaste, for, the, endless, clamor, for, encores, was, facing, a, thunderously, applauding, house, and, raised, his, hand, saying, ladies, and, gentlemen, if, you, do, not, stop, this, immediately, i, shall, play, you, bach, s, 48, preludes, and, fugues, from, beginning, to, end, the, audience, laughed, but, also, stopped, applauding, as, they, knew, von, b, low, was, able, to, perform, the, work, from, memory, bach, s, example, inspired, numerous, composers, of, the, 19th, century, for, instance, in, 1835, chopin, started, composing, his, 24, preludes, op, 28, inspired, by, the, well, tempered, clavier, in, the, 20th, century, dmitri, shostakovich, wrote, his, 24, preludes, and, fugues, an, even, closer, reference, to, bach, s, model, another, inspiration, after, bach, even, before, shostakovich, was, in, 1940, when, vsevolod, zaderatsky, created, his, main, work, in, the, gulag, amp, conditions, a, full, cycle, of, 24, preludes, and, fugues, the, work, was, unpublished, during, a, long, time, and, practically, unknown, until, its, premiere, in, 2014, mario, castelnuovo, tedesco, wrote, les, guitares, bien, temp, r, es, the, well, tempered, guitars, a, set, of, 24, preludes, and, fugues, for, two, guitars, in, all, 24, major, and, minor, keys, inspired, in, both, title, and, structure, by, bach, s, work, the, best, known, piece, from, either, book, is, the, first, prelude, of, book, 1, anna, magdalena, bach, copied, a, short, version, of, this, prelude, in, her, 1725, notebook, no, 29, the, accessibility, of, this, prelude, the, easy, key, of, c, major, and, its, use, of, arpeggiated, chords, have, made, it, one, of, the, most, commonly, studied, pieces, for, piano, students, this, prelude, also, served, as, the, basis, for, the, ave, maria, of, charles, gounod, alexander, siloti, transcribed, a, piano, arrangement, of, the, early, version, of, prelude, and, fugue, in, e, minor, bwv, 855a, transposed, into, a, prelude, in, b, minor, the, first, complete, recording, of, the, well, tempered, clavier, was, made, on, the, piano, by, edwin, fischer, for, emi, between, 1933, and, 1936, the, second, was, made, by, wanda, landowska, on, harpsichord, for, rca, victor, in, 1949, book, 1, and, 1952, book, 2, helmut, walcha, better, known, as, an, organist, recorded, both, books, between, 1959, and, 1961, on, a, harpsichord, daniel, chorzempa, made, the, first, recording, using, multiple, instruments, harpsichord, clavichord, organ, and, fortepiano, for, philips, in, 1982, as, of, 2013, over, 150, recordings, have, been, documented, the, glenn, gould, recording, of, bwv, 870, was, included, on, the, voyager, golden, record, visit, https, maplelab, net, bach, to, listen, and, visualize, performances, of, book, 1, by, fisher, landowska, walcha, and, 10, other, renowned, pianists,
