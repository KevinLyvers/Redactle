jazz, is, a, music, genre, that, originated, in, the, african, american, communities, of, new, orleans, louisiana, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, with, its, roots, in, blues, ragtime, european, harmony, and, african, rhythmic, rituals, since, the, 1920s, jazz, age, it, has, been, recognized, as, a, major, form, of, musical, expression, in, traditional, and, popular, music, jazz, is, characterized, by, swing, and, blue, notes, complex, chords, call, and, response, vocals, polyrhythms, and, improvisation, as, jazz, spread, around, the, world, it, drew, on, national, regional, and, local, musical, cultures, which, gave, rise, to, different, styles, new, orleans, jazz, began, in, the, early, 1910s, combining, earlier, brass, band, marches, french, quadrilles, biguine, ragtime, and, blues, with, collective, polyphonic, improvisation, however, jazz, did, not, begin, as, a, single, musical, tradition, in, new, orleans, or, elsewhere, in, the, 1930s, arranged, dance, oriented, swing, big, bands, kansas, city, jazz, a, hard, swinging, bluesy, improvisational, style, and, gypsy, jazz, a, style, that, emphasized, musette, waltzes, were, the, prominent, styles, bebop, emerged, in, the, 1940s, shifting, jazz, from, danceable, popular, music, toward, a, more, challenging, musician, s, music, which, was, played, at, faster, tempos, and, used, more, chord, based, improvisation, cool, jazz, developed, near, the, end, of, the, 1940s, introducing, calmer, smoother, sounds, and, long, linear, melodic, lines, the, mid, 1950s, saw, the, emergence, of, hard, bop, which, introduced, influences, from, rhythm, and, blues, gospel, and, blues, to, small, groups, and, particularly, to, saxophone, and, piano, modal, jazz, developed, in, the, late, 1950s, using, the, mode, or, musical, scale, as, the, basis, of, musical, structure, and, improvisation, as, did, free, jazz, which, explored, playing, without, regular, meter, beat, and, formal, structures, jazz, rock, fusion, appeared, in, the, late, 1960s, and, early, 1970s, combining, jazz, improvisation, with, rock, music, s, rhythms, electric, instruments, and, highly, amplified, stage, sound, in, the, early, 1980s, a, commercial, form, of, jazz, fusion, called, smooth, jazz, became, successful, garnering, significant, radio, airplay, other, styles, and, genres, abound, in, the, 21st, century, such, as, latin, and, afro, cuban, jazz, the, origin, of, the, word, jazz, has, resulted, in, considerable, research, and, its, history, is, well, documented, it, is, believed, to, be, related, to, jasm, a, slang, term, dating, back, to, 1860, meaning, pep, energy, the, earliest, written, record, of, the, word, is, in, a, 1912, article, in, the, los, angeles, times, in, which, a, minor, league, baseball, pitcher, described, a, pitch, which, he, called, a, jazz, ball, because, it, wobbles, and, you, simply, can, t, do, anything, with, it, the, use, of, the, word, in, a, musical, context, was, documented, as, early, as, 1915, in, the, chicago, daily, tribune, its, first, documented, use, in, a, musical, context, in, new, orleans, was, in, a, november, 14, 1916, times, picayune, article, about, jas, bands, in, an, interview, with, national, public, radio, musician, eubie, blake, offered, his, recollections, of, the, slang, connotations, of, the, term, saying, when, broadway, picked, it, up, they, called, it, j, a, z, z, it, wasn, t, called, that, it, was, spelled, j, a, s, s, that, was, dirty, and, if, you, knew, what, it, was, you, wouldn, t, say, it, in, front, of, ladies, the, american, dialect, society, named, it, the, word, of, the, 20th, century, jazz, is, difficult, to, define, because, it, encompasses, a, wide, range, of, music, spanning, a, period, of, over, 100, years, from, ragtime, to, rock, infused, fusion, attempts, have, been, made, to, define, jazz, from, the, perspective, of, other, musical, traditions, such, as, european, music, history, or, african, music, but, critic, joachim, ernst, berendt, argues, that, its, terms, of, reference, and, its, definition, should, be, broader, defining, jazz, as, a, form, of, art, music, which, originated, in, the, united, states, through, the, confrontation, of, the, negro, with, european, music, and, arguing, that, it, differs, from, european, music, in, that, jazz, has, a, special, relationship, to, time, defined, as, swing, jazz, involves, a, spontaneity, and, vitality, of, musical, production, in, which, improvisation, plays, a, role, and, contains, a, sonority, and, manner, of, phrasing, which, mirror, the, individuality, of, the, performing, jazz, musician, a, broader, definition, that, encompasses, different, eras, of, jazz, has, been, proposed, by, travis, jackson, it, is, music, that, includes, qualities, such, as, swing, improvising, group, interaction, developing, an, individual, voice, and, being, open, to, different, musical, possibilities, krin, gibbard, argued, that, jazz, is, a, construct, which, designates, a, number, of, musics, with, enough, in, common, to, be, understood, as, part, of, a, coherent, tradition, duke, ellington, one, of, jazz, s, most, famous, figures, said, it, s, all, music, although, jazz, is, considered, difficult, to, define, in, part, because, it, contains, many, subgenres, improvisation, is, one, of, its, defining, elements, the, centrality, of, improvisation, is, attributed, to, the, influence, of, earlier, forms, of, music, such, as, blues, a, form, of, folk, music, which, arose, in, part, from, the, work, songs, and, field, hollers, of, african, american, slaves, on, plantations, these, work, songs, were, commonly, structured, around, a, repetitive, call, and, response, pattern, but, early, blues, was, also, improvisational, classical, music, performance, is, evaluated, more, by, its, fidelity, to, the, musical, score, with, less, attention, given, to, interpretation, ornamentation, and, accompaniment, the, classical, performer, s, goal, is, to, play, the, composition, as, it, was, written, in, contrast, jazz, is, often, characterized, by, the, product, of, interaction, and, collaboration, placing, less, value, on, the, contribution, of, the, composer, if, there, is, one, and, more, on, the, performer, the, jazz, performer, interprets, a, tune, in, individual, ways, never, playing, the, same, composition, twice, depending, on, the, performer, s, mood, experience, and, interaction, with, band, members, or, audience, members, the, performer, may, change, melodies, harmonies, and, time, signatures, in, early, dixieland, a, k, a, new, orleans, jazz, performers, took, turns, playing, melodies, and, improvising, countermelodies, in, the, swing, era, of, the, 1920s, 40s, big, bands, relied, more, on, arrangements, which, were, written, or, learned, by, ear, and, memorized, soloists, improvised, within, these, arrangements, in, the, bebop, era, of, the, 1940s, big, bands, gave, way, to, small, groups, and, minimal, arrangements, in, which, the, melody, was, stated, briefly, at, the, beginning, and, most, of, the, piece, was, improvised, modal, jazz, abandoned, chord, progressions, to, allow, musicians, to, improvise, even, more, in, many, forms, of, jazz, a, soloist, is, supported, by, a, rhythm, section, of, one, or, more, chordal, instruments, piano, guitar, double, bass, and, drums, the, rhythm, section, plays, chords, and, rhythms, that, outline, the, composition, structure, and, complement, the, soloist, in, avant, garde, and, free, jazz, the, separation, of, soloist, and, band, is, reduced, and, there, is, license, or, even, a, requirement, for, the, abandoning, of, chords, scales, and, meters, since, the, emergence, of, bebop, forms, of, jazz, that, are, commercially, oriented, or, influenced, by, popular, music, have, been, criticized, according, to, bruce, johnson, there, has, always, been, a, tension, between, jazz, as, a, commercial, music, and, an, art, form, regarding, the, dixieland, jazz, revival, of, the, 1940s, black, musicians, rejected, it, as, being, shallow, nostalgia, entertainment, for, white, audiences, on, the, other, hand, traditional, jazz, enthusiasts, have, dismissed, bebop, free, jazz, and, jazz, fusion, as, forms, of, debasement, and, betrayal, an, alternative, view, is, that, jazz, can, absorb, and, transform, diverse, musical, styles, by, avoiding, the, creation, of, norms, jazz, allows, avant, garde, styles, to, emerge, for, some, african, americans, jazz, has, drawn, attention, to, african, american, contributions, to, culture, and, history, for, others, jazz, is, a, reminder, of, an, oppressive, and, racist, society, and, restrictions, on, their, artistic, visions, amiri, baraka, argues, that, there, is, a, white, jazz, genre, that, expresses, whiteness, white, jazz, musicians, appeared, in, the, midwest, and, in, other, areas, throughout, the, u, s, papa, jack, laine, who, ran, the, reliance, band, in, new, orleans, in, the, 1910s, was, called, the, father, of, white, jazz, the, original, dixieland, jazz, band, whose, members, were, white, were, the, first, jazz, group, to, record, and, bix, beiderbecke, was, one, of, the, most, prominent, jazz, soloists, of, the, 1920s, the, chicago, style, was, developed, by, white, musicians, such, as, eddie, condon, bud, freeman, jimmy, mcpartland, and, dave, tough, others, from, chicago, such, as, benny, goodman, and, gene, krupa, became, leading, members, of, swing, during, the, 1930s, many, bands, included, both, black, and, white, musicians, these, musicians, helped, change, attitudes, toward, race, in, the, u, s, female, jazz, performers, and, composers, have, contributed, to, jazz, throughout, its, history, although, betty, carter, ella, fitzgerald, adelaide, hall, billie, holiday, peggy, lee, abbey, lincoln, anita, o, day, dinah, washington, and, ethel, waters, were, recognized, for, their, vocal, talent, less, familiar, were, bandleaders, composers, and, instrumentalists, such, as, pianist, lil, hardin, armstrong, trumpeter, valaida, snow, and, songwriters, irene, higginbotham, and, dorothy, fields, women, began, playing, instruments, in, jazz, in, the, early, 1920s, drawing, particular, recognition, on, piano, when, male, jazz, musicians, were, drafted, during, world, war, ii, many, all, female, bands, replaced, them, the, international, sweethearts, of, rhythm, which, was, founded, in, 1937, was, a, popular, band, that, became, the, first, all, female, integrated, band, in, the, u,

jazz, instrumentalists, were, prominent, some, sustaining, long, careers, some, of, the, most, distinctive, improvisers, composers, and, bandleaders, in, jazz, have, been, women, trombonist, melba, liston, is, acknowledged, as, the, first, female, horn, player, to, work, in, major, bands, and, to, make, a, real, impact, on, jazz, not, only, as, a, musician, but, also, as, a, respected, composer, and, arranger, particularly, through, her, collaborations, with, randy, weston, from, the, late, 1950s, into, the, 1990s, jewish, americans, played, a, significant, role, in, jazz, as, jazz, spread, it, developed, to, encompass, many, different, cultures, and, the, work, of, jewish, composers, in, tin, pan, alley, helped, shape, the, many, different, sounds, that, jazz, came, to, incorporate, jewish, americans, were, able, to, thrive, in, jazz, because, of, the, probationary, whiteness, that, they, were, allotted, at, the, time, george, bornstein, wrote, that, african, americans, were, sympathetic, to, the, plight, of, the, jewish, american, and, vice, versa, as, disenfranchised, minorities, themselves, jewish, composers, of, popular, music, saw, themselves, as, natural, allies, with, african, americans, the, jazz, singer, with, al, jolson, is, one, example, of, how, jewish, americans, were, able, to, bring, jazz, music, that, african, americans, developed, into, popular, culture, benny, goodman, was, a, vital, jewish, american, to, the, progression, of, jazz, goodman, was, the, leader, of, a, racially, integrated, band, named, king, of, swing, his, jazz, concert, in, the, carnegie, hall, in, 1938, was, the, first, ever, to, be, played, there, the, concert, was, described, by, bruce, eder, as, the, single, most, important, jazz, or, popular, music, concert, in, history, shep, fields, also, helped, to, popularize, sweet, jazz, music, through, his, appearances, and, big, band, remote, broadcasts, from, such, landmark, venues, as, chicago, s, palmer, house, broadway, s, paramount, theater, and, the, starlight, roof, at, the, famed, waldorf, astoria, hotel, he, entertained, audiences, with, a, light, elegant, musical, style, which, remained, popular, with, audiences, for, nearly, three, decades, from, the, 1930s, until, the, late, 1950s, jazz, originated, in, the, late, 19th, to, early, 20th, century, it, developed, out, of, many, forms, of, music, including, blues, spirituals, hymns, marches, vaudeville, song, ragtime, and, dance, music, it, also, incorporated, interpretations, of, american, and, european, classical, music, entwined, with, african, and, slave, folk, songs, and, the, influences, of, west, african, culture, its, composition, and, style, have, changed, many, times, throughout, the, years, with, each, performer, s, personal, interpretation, and, improvisation, which, is, also, one, of, the, greatest, appeals, of, the, genre, by, the, 18th, century, slaves, in, the, new, orleans, area, gathered, socially, at, a, special, market, in, an, area, which, later, became, known, as, congo, square, famous, for, its, african, dances, by, 1866, the, atlantic, slave, trade, had, brought, nearly, 400, 000, africans, to, north, america, the, slaves, came, largely, from, west, africa, and, the, greater, congo, river, basin, and, brought, strong, musical, traditions, with, them, the, african, traditions, primarily, use, a, single, line, melody, and, call, and, response, pattern, and, the, rhythms, have, a, counter, metric, structure, and, reflect, african, speech, patterns, an, 1885, account, says, that, they, were, making, strange, music, creole, on, an, equally, strange, variety, of, instruments, washboards, washtubs, jugs, boxes, beaten, with, sticks, or, bones, and, a, drum, made, by, stretching, skin, over, a, flour, barrel, lavish, festivals, with, african, based, dances, to, drums, were, organized, on, sundays, at, place, congo, or, congo, square, in, new, orleans, until, 1843, there, are, historical, accounts, of, other, music, and, dance, gatherings, elsewhere, in, the, southern, united, states, robert, palmer, said, of, percussive, slave, music, usually, such, music, was, associated, with, annual, festivals, when, the, year, s, crop, was, harvested, and, several, days, were, set, aside, for, celebration, as, late, as, 1861, a, traveler, in, north, carolina, saw, dancers, dressed, in, costumes, that, included, horned, headdresses, and, cow, tails, and, heard, music, provided, by, a, sheepskin, covered, gumbo, box, apparently, a, frame, drum, triangles, and, jawbones, furnished, the, auxiliary, percussion, there, are, quite, a, few, from, the, southeastern, states, and, louisiana, dating, from, the, period, 1820, 1850, some, of, the, earliest, delta, settlers, came, from, the, vicinity, of, new, orleans, where, drumming, was, never, actively, discouraged, for, very, long, and, homemade, drums, were, used, to, accompany, public, dancing, until, the, outbreak, of, the, civil, war, another, influence, came, from, the, harmonic, style, of, hymns, of, the, church, which, black, slaves, had, learned, and, incorporated, into, their, own, music, as, spirituals, the, origins, of, the, blues, are, undocumented, though, they, can, be, seen, as, the, secular, counterpart, of, the, spirituals, however, as, gerhard, kubik, points, out, whereas, the, spirituals, are, homophonic, rural, blues, and, early, jazz, was, largely, based, on, concepts, of, heterophony, during, the, early, 19th, century, an, increasing, number, of, black, musicians, learned, to, play, european, instruments, particularly, the, violin, which, they, used, to, parody, european, dance, music, in, their, own, cakewalk, dances, in, turn, european, american, minstrel, show, performers, in, blackface, popularized, the, music, internationally, combining, syncopation, with, european, harmonic, accompaniment, in, the, mid, 1800s, the, white, new, orleans, composer, louis, moreau, gottschalk, adapted, slave, rhythms, and, melodies, from, cuba, and, other, caribbean, islands, into, piano, salon, music, new, orleans, was, the, main, nexus, between, the, afro, caribbean, and, african, american, cultures, the, black, codes, outlawed, drumming, by, slaves, which, meant, that, african, drumming, traditions, were, not, preserved, in, north, america, unlike, in, cuba, haiti, and, elsewhere, in, the, caribbean, african, based, rhythmic, patterns, were, retained, in, the, united, states, in, large, part, through, body, rhythms, such, as, stomping, clapping, and, patting, juba, dancing, in, the, opinion, of, jazz, historian, ernest, borneman, what, preceded, new, orleans, jazz, before, 1890, was, afro, latin, music, similar, to, what, was, played, in, the, caribbean, at, the, time, a, three, stroke, pattern, known, in, cuban, music, as, tresillo, is, a, fundamental, rhythmic, figure, heard, in, many, different, slave, musics, of, the, caribbean, as, well, as, the, afro, caribbean, folk, dances, performed, in, new, orleans, congo, square, and, gottschalk, s, compositions, for, example, souvenirs, from, havana, 1859, tresillo, shown, below, is, the, most, basic, and, most, prevalent, duple, pulse, rhythmic, cell, in, sub, saharan, african, music, traditions, and, the, music, of, the, african, diaspora, tresillo, is, heard, prominently, in, new, orleans, second, line, music, and, in, other, forms, of, popular, music, from, that, city, from, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, to, present, by, and, large, the, simpler, african, rhythmic, patterns, survived, in, jazz, because, they, could, be, adapted, more, readily, to, european, rhythmic, conceptions, jazz, historian, gunther, schuller, observed, some, survived, others, were, discarded, as, the, europeanization, progressed, in, the, post, civil, war, period, after, 1865, african, americans, were, able, to, obtain, surplus, military, bass, drums, snare, drums, and, fifes, and, an, original, african, american, drum, and, fife, music, emerged, featuring, tresillo, and, related, syncopated, rhythmic, figures, this, was, a, drumming, tradition, that, was, distinct, from, its, caribbean, counterparts, expressing, a, uniquely, african, american, sensibility, the, snare, and, bass, drummers, played, syncopated, cross, rhythms, observed, the, writer, robert, palmer, speculating, that, this, tradition, must, have, dated, back, to, the, latter, half, of, the, nineteenth, century, and, it, could, have, not, have, developed, in, the, first, place, if, there, hadn, t, been, a, reservoir, of, polyrhythmic, sophistication, in, the, culture, it, nurtured, african, american, music, began, incorporating, afro, cuban, rhythmic, motifs, in, the, 19th, century, when, the, habanera, cuban, contradanza, gained, international, popularity, musicians, from, havana, and, new, orleans, would, take, the, twice, daily, ferry, between, both, cities, to, perform, and, the, habanera, quickly, took, root, in, the, musically, fertile, crescent, city, john, storm, roberts, states, that, the, musical, genre, habanera, reached, the, u, s, twenty, years, before, the, first, rag, was, published, for, the, more, than, quarter, century, in, which, the, cakewalk, ragtime, and, proto, jazz, were, forming, and, developing, the, habanera, was, a, consistent, part, of, african, american, popular, music, habaneras, were, widely, available, as, sheet, music, and, were, the, first, written, music, which, was, rhythmically, based, on, an, african, motif, 1803, from, the, perspective, of, african, american, music, the, habanera, rhythm, also, known, as, congo, tango, congo, or, tango, can, be, thought, of, as, a, combination, of, tresillo, and, the, backbeat, the, habanera, was, the, first, of, many, cuban, music, genres, which, enjoyed, periods, of, popularity, in, the, united, states, and, reinforced, and, inspired, the, use, of, tresillo, based, rhythms, in, african, american, music, new, orleans, native, louis, moreau, gottschalk, s, piano, piece, ojos, criollos, danse, cubaine, 1860, was, influenced, by, the, composer, s, studies, in, cuba, the, habanera, rhythm, is, clearly, heard, in, the, left, hand, 125, in, gottschalk, s, symphonic, work, a, night, in, the, tropics, 1859, the, tresillo, variant, cinquillo, appears, extensively, the, figure, was, later, used, by, scott, joplin, and, other, ragtime, composers, comparing, the, music, of, new, orleans, with, the, music, of, cuba, wynton, marsalis, observes, that, tresillo, is, the, new, orleans, clav, a, spanish, word, meaning, code, or, key, as, in, the, key, to, a, puzzle, or, mystery, although, the, pattern, is, only, half, a, clave, marsalis, makes, the, point, that, the, single, celled, figure, is, the, guide, pattern, of, new, orleans, music, jelly, roll, morton, called, the, rhythmic, figure, the, spanish, tinge, and, considered, it, an, essential, ingredient, of, jazz, the, abolition, of, slavery, in, 1865, led, to, new, opportunities, for, the, education, of, freed, african, americans, although, strict, segregation, limited, employment, opportunities, for, most, blacks, many, were, able, to, find, work, in, entertainment, black, musicians, were, able, to, provide, entertainment, in, dances, minstrel, shows, and, in, vaudeville, during, which, time, many, marching, bands, were, formed, black, pianists, played, in, bars, clubs, and, brothels, as, ragtime, developed, ragtime, appeared, as, sheet, music, popularized, by, african, american, musicians, such, as, the, entertainer, ernest, hogan, whose, hit, songs, appeared, in, 1895, two, years, later, vess, ossman, recorded, a, medley, of, these, songs, as, a, banjo, solo, known, as, rag, time, medley, also, in, 1897, the, white, composer, william, krell, published, his, mississippi, rag, as, the, first, written, piano, instrumental, ragtime, piece, and, tom, turpin, published, his, harlem, rag, the, first, rag, published, by, an, african, american, classically, trained, pianist, scott, joplin, produced, his, original, rags, in, 1898, and, in, 1899, had, an, international, hit, with, maple, leaf, rag, a, multi, strain, ragtime, march, with, four, parts, that, feature, recurring, themes, and, a, bass, line, with, copious, seventh, chords, its, structure, was, the, basis, for, many, other, rags, and, the, syncopations, in, the, right, hand, especially, in, the, transition, between, the, first, and, second, strain, were, novel, at, the, time, the, last, four, measures, of, scott, joplin, s, maple, leaf, rag, 1899, are, shown, below, african, based, rhythmic, patterns, such, as, tresillo, and, its, variants, the, habanera, rhythm, and, cinquillo, are, heard, in, the, ragtime, compositions, of, joplin, and, turpin, joplin, s, solace, 1909, is, generally, considered, to, be, in, the, habanera, genre, both, of, the, pianist, s, hands, play, in, a, syncopated, fashion, completely, abandoning, any, sense, of, a, march, rhythm, ned, sublette, postulates, that, the, tresillo, habanera, rhythm, found, its, way, into, ragtime, and, the, cakewalk, whilst, roberts, suggests, that, the, habanera, influence, may, have, been, part, of, what, freed, black, music, from, ragtime, s, european, bass, in, the, northeastern, united, states, a, hot, style, of, playing, ragtime, had, developed, notably, james, reese, europe, s, symphonic, clef, club, orchestra, in, new, york, city, which, played, a, benefit, concert, at, carnegie, hall, in, 1912, the,

the, rhythm, and, bassline, in, ohio, and, elsewhere, in, the, mid, west, the, major, influence, was, ragtime, until, about, 1919, around, 1912, when, the, four, string, banjo, and, saxophone, came, in, musicians, began, to, improvise, the, melody, line, but, the, harmony, and, rhythm, remained, unchanged, a, contemporary, account, states, that, blues, could, only, be, heard, in, jazz, in, the, gut, bucket, cabarets, which, were, generally, looked, down, upon, by, the, black, middle, class, blues, is, the, name, given, to, both, a, musical, form, and, a, music, genre, which, originated, in, african, american, communities, of, primarily, the, deep, south, of, the, united, states, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, from, their, spirituals, work, songs, field, hollers, shouts, and, chants, and, rhymed, simple, narrative, ballads, the, african, use, of, pentatonic, scales, contributed, to, the, development, of, blue, notes, in, blues, and, jazz, as, kubik, explains, many, of, the, rural, blues, of, the, deep, south, are, stylistically, an, extension, and, merger, of, basically, two, broad, accompanied, song, style, traditions, in, the, west, central, sudanic, belt, w, c,

limited, melodic, range, sounding, like, a, field, holler, and, the, guitar, accompaniment, was, slapped, rather, than, strummed, like, a, small, drum, which, responded, in, syncopated, accents, functioning, as, another, voice, handy, and, his, band, members, were, formally, trained, african, american, musicians, who, had, not, grown, up, with, the, blues, yet, he, was, able, to, adapt, the, blues, to, a, larger, band, instrument, format, and, arrange, them, in, a, popular, music, form, handy, wrote, about, his, adopting, of, the, blues, the, primitive, southern, negro, as, he, sang, was, sure, to, bear, down, on, the, third, and, seventh, tone, of, the, scale, slurring, between, major, and, minor, whether, in, the, cotton, field, of, the, delta, or, on, the, levee, up, st, louis, way, it, was, always, the, same, till, then, however, i, had, never, heard, this, slur, used, by, a, more, sophisticated, negro, or, by, any, white, man, i, tried, to, convey, this, effect, by, introducing, flat, thirds, and, sevenths, now, called, blue, notes, into, my, song, although, its, prevailing, key, was, major, and, i, carried, this, device, into, my, melody, as, well, the, publication, of, his, memphis, blues, sheet, music, in, 1912, introduced, the, 12, bar, blues, to, the, world, although, gunther, schuller, argues, that, it, is, not, really, a, blues, but, more, like, a, cakewalk, this, composition, as, well, as, his, later, st, louis, blues, and, others, included, the, habanera, rhythm, and, would, become, jazz, standards, handy, s, music, career, began, in, the, pre, jazz, era, and, contributed, to, the, codification, of, jazz, through, the, publication, of, some, of, the, first, jazz, sheet, music, the, music, of, new, orleans, louisiana, had, a, profound, effect, on, the, creation, of, early, jazz, in, new, orleans, slaves, could, practice, elements, of, their, culture, such, as, voodoo, and, playing, drums, many, early, jazz, musicians, played, in, the, bars, and, brothels, of, the, red, light, district, around, basin, street, called, storyville, in, addition, to, dance, bands, there, were, marching, bands, which, played, at, lavish, funerals, later, called, jazz, funerals, the, instruments, used, by, marching, bands, and, dance, bands, became, the, instruments, of, jazz, brass, drums, and, reeds, tuned, in, the, european, 12, tone, scale, small, bands, contained, a, combination, of, self, taught, and, formally, educated, musicians, many, from, the, funeral, procession, tradition, these, bands, traveled, in, black, communities, in, the, deep, south, beginning, in, 1914, louisiana, creole, and, african, american, musicians, played, in, vaudeville, shows, which, carried, jazz, to, cities, in, the, northern, and, western, parts, of, the, u, s, jazz, became, international, in, 1914, when, the, creole, band, with, cornettist, freddie, keppard, performed, the, first, ever, jazz, concert, outside, the, united, states, at, the, pantages, playhouse, theatre, in, winnipeg, canada, in, new, orleans, a, white, bandleader, named, papa, jack, laine, integrated, blacks, and, whites, in, his, marching, band, he, was, known, as, the, father, of, white, jazz, because, of, the, many, top, players, he, employed, such, as, george, brunies, sharkey, bonano, and, future, members, of, the, original, dixieland, jass, band, during, the, early, 1900s, jazz, was, mostly, performed, in, african, american, and, mulatto, communities, due, to, segregation, laws, storyville, brought, jazz, to, a, wider, audience, through, tourists, who, visited, the, port, city, of, new, orleans, many, jazz, musicians, from, african, american, communities, were, hired, to, perform, in, bars, and, brothels, these, included, buddy, bolden, and, jelly, roll, morton, in, addition, to, those, from, other, communities, such, as, lorenzo, tio, and, alcide, nunez, louis, armstrong, started, his, career, in, storyville, and, found, success, in, chicago, storyville, was, shut, down, by, the, u, s, government, in, 1917, cornetist, buddy, bolden, played, in, new, orleans, from, 1895, to, 1906, no, recordings, by, him, exist, his, band, is, credited, with, creating, the, big, four, the, first, syncopated, bass, drum, pattern, to, deviate, from, the, standard, on, the, beat, march, as, the, example, below, shows, the, second, half, of, the, big, four, pattern, is, the, habanera, rhythm, afro, creole, pianist, jelly, roll, morton, began, his, career, in, storyville, beginning, in, 1904, he, toured, with, vaudeville, shows, to, southern, cities, chicago, and, new, york, city, in, 1905, he, composed, jelly, roll, blues, which, became, the, first, jazz, arrangement, in, print, when, it, was, published, in, 1915, it, introduced, more, musicians, to, the, new, orleans, style, morton, considered, the, tresillo, habanera, which, he, called, the, spanish, tinge, an, essential, ingredient, of, jazz, now, in, one, of, my, earliest, tunes, new, orleans, blues, you, can, notice, the, spanish, tinge, in, fact, if, you, can, t, manage, to, put, tinges, of, spanish, in, your, tunes, you, will, never, be, able, to, get, the, right, seasoning, i, call, it, for, jazz, an, excerpt, of, new, orleans, blues, is, shown, below, in, the, excerpt, the, left, hand, plays, the, tresillo, rhythm, while, the, right, hand, plays, variations, on, cinquillo, morton, was, a, crucial, innovator, in, the, evolution, from, the, early, jazz, form, known, as, ragtime, to, jazz, piano, and, could, perform, pieces, in, either, style, in, 1938, morton, made, a, series, of, recordings, for, the, library, of, congress, in, which, he, demonstrated, the, difference, between, the, two, styles, morton, s, solos, however, were, still, close, to, ragtime, and, were, not, merely, improvisations, over, chord, changes, as, in, later, jazz, but, his, use, of, the, blues, was, of, equal, importance, morton, loosened, ragtime, s, rigid, rhythmic, feeling, decreasing, its, embellishments, and, employing, a, swing, feeling, swing, is, the, most, important, and, enduring, african, based, rhythmic, technique, used, in, jazz, an, oft, quoted, definition, of, swing, by, louis, armstrong, is, if, you, don, t, feel, it, you, ll, never, know, it, the, new, harvard, dictionary, of, music, states, that, swing, is, an, intangible, rhythmic, momentum, in, jazz, swing, defies, analysis, claims, to, its, presence, may, inspire, arguments, the, dictionary, does, nonetheless, provide, the, useful, description, of, triple, subdivisions, of, the, beat, contrasted, with, duple, subdivisions, swing, superimposes, six, subdivisions, of, the, beat, over, a, basic, pulse, structure, or, four, subdivisions, this, aspect, of, swing, is, far, more, prevalent, in, african, american, music, than, in, afro, caribbean, music, one, aspect, of, swing, which, is, heard, in, more, rhythmically, complex, diaspora, musics, places, strokes, in, between, the, triple, and, duple, pulse, grids, new, orleans, brass, bands, are, a, lasting, influence, contributing, horn, players, to, the, world, of, professional, jazz, with, the, distinct, sound, of, the, city, whilst, helping, black, children, escape, poverty, the, leader, of, new, orleans, camelia, brass, band, d, jalma, ganier, taught, louis, armstrong, to, play, trumpet, armstrong, would, then, popularize, the, new, orleans, style, of, trumpet, playing, and, then, expand, it, like, jelly, roll, morton, armstrong, is, also, credited, with, the, abandonment, of, ragtime, s, stiffness, in, favor, of, swung, notes, armstrong, perhaps, more, than, any, other, musician, codified, the, rhythmic, technique, of, swing, in, jazz, and, broadened, the, jazz, solo, vocabulary, the, original, dixieland, jass, band, made, the, music, s, first, recordings, early, in, 1917, and, their, livery, stable, blues, became, the, earliest, released, jazz, record, that, year, numerous, other, bands, made, recordings, featuring, jazz, in, the, title, or, band, name, but, most, were, ragtime, or, novelty, records, rather, than, jazz, in, february, 1918, during, world, war, i, james, reese, europe, s, hellfighters, infantry, band, took, ragtime, to, europe, then, on, their, return, recorded, dixieland, standards, including, darktown, strutters, ball, from, 1920, to, 1933, prohibition, in, the, united, states, banned, the, sale, of, alcoholic, drinks, resulting, in, illicit, speakeasies, which, became, lively, venues, of, the, jazz, age, hosting, popular, music, dance, songs, novelty, songs, and, show, tunes, jazz, began, to, get, a, reputation, as, immoral, and, many, members, of, the, older, generations, saw, it, as, a, threat, to, the, old, cultural, values, by, promoting, the, decadent, values, of, the, roaring, 20s, henry, van, dyke, of, princeton, university, wrote, it, is, not, music, at, all, it, s, merely, an, irritation, of, the, nerves, of, hearing, a, sensual, teasing, of, the, strings, of, physical, passion, the, new, york, times, reported, that, siberian, villagers, used, jazz, to, scare, away, bears, but, the, villagers, had, used, pots, and, pans, another, story, claimed, that, the, fatal, heart, attack, of, a, celebrated, conductor, was, caused, by, jazz, in, 1919, kid, ory, s, original, creole, jazz, band, of, musicians, from, new, orleans, began, playing, in, san, francisco, and, los, angeles, where, in, 1922, they, became, the, first, black, jazz, band, of, new, orleans, origin, to, make, recordings, during, the, same, year, bessie, smith, made, her, first, recordings, chicago, was, developing, hot, jazz, and, king, oliver, joined, bill, johnson, bix, beiderbecke, formed, the, wolverines, in, 1924, despite, its, southern, black, origins, there, was, a, larger, market, for, jazzy, dance, music, played, by, white, orchestras, in, 1918, paul, whiteman, and, his, orchestra, became, a, hit, in, san, francisco, he, signed, a, contract, with, victor, and, became, the, top, bandleader, of, the, 1920s, giving, hot, jazz, a, white, component, hiring, white, musicians, such, as, bix, beiderbecke, jimmy, dorsey, tommy, dorsey, frankie, trumbauer, and, joe, venuti, in, 1924, whiteman, commissioned, george, gershwin, s, rhapsody, in, blue, which, was, premiered, by, his, orchestra, jazz, began, to, be, recognized, as, a, notable, musical, form, olin, downes, reviewing, the, concert, in, the, new, york, times, wrote, this, composition, shows, extraordinary, talent, as, it, shows, a, young, composer, with, aims, that, go, far, beyond, those, of, his, ilk, struggling, with, a, form, of, which, he, is, far, from, being, master, in, spite, of, all, this, he, has, expressed, himself, in, a, significant, and, on, the, whole, highly, original, form, his, first, theme, is, no, mere, dance, tune, it, is, an, idea, or, several, ideas, correlated, and, combined, in, varying, and, contrasting, rhythms, that, immediately, intrigue, the, listener, after, whiteman, s, band, successfully, toured, europe, huge, hot, jazz, orchestras, in, theater, pits, caught, on, with, other, whites, including, fred, waring, jean, goldkette, and, nathaniel, shilkret, according, to, mario, dunkel, whiteman, s, success, was, based, on, a, rhetoric, of, domestication, according, to, which, he, had, elevated, and, rendered, valuable, read, white, a, previously, inchoate, read, black, kind, of, music, whiteman, s, success, caused, black, artists, to, follow, suit, including, earl, hines, who, opened, in, the, grand, terrace, cafe, in, chicago, in, 1928, washington, d, c, native, duke, ellington, who, opened, at, the, cotton, club, in, harlem, in, 1927, lionel, hampton, fletcher, henderson, claude, hopkins, and, don, redman, with, henderson, and, redman, developing, the, talking, to, one, another, formula, for, hot, swing, music, in, 1924, louis, armstrong, joined, the, fletcher, henderson, dance, band, for, a, year, as, featured, soloist, by, 1924, one, of, armstrong, s, favorite, sweet, jazz, big, bands, was, also, formed, in, canada, by, guy, lombardo, his, royal, canadians, orchestra, specialized, in, performances, of, the, sweetest, music, this, side, of, heaven, which, transcended, racial, boundaries, the, original, new, orleans, style, was, polyphonic, with, theme, variation, and, simultaneous, collective, improvisation, armstrong, was, a, master, of, his, hometown, style, but, by, the, time, he, joined, henderson, s, band, he, was, already, a, trailblazer, in, a, new, phase, of, jazz, with, its, emphasis, on, arrangements, and, soloists, armstrong, s, solos, went, well, beyond, the, theme, improvisation, concept, and, extemporized, on, chords, rather, than, melodies, according, to, schuller, by, comparison, the, solos, by, armstrong, s, bandmates, including, a, young, coleman, hawkins, sounded, stiff, stodgy, with, jerky, rhythms, and, a, grey, undistinguished, tone, quality, the, following, example, shows, a, short, excerpt, of, the, straight, melody, of, mandy, make, up, your, mind, by, george, w, meyer, and, arthur, johnston, top, compared, with, armstrong, s, solo, improvisations, below, recorded, 1924, armstrong, s, solos, were, a, significant, factor, in, making, jazz, a, true, 20th, century, language, after, leaving, henderson, s, group, armstrong, formed, his, hot, five, band, where, he, popularized, scat, singing, the, 1930s, belonged, to, popular, swing, big, bands, in, which, some, virtuoso, soloists, became, as, famous, as, the, band, leaders, key, figures, in, developing, the, big, jazz, band, included, bandleaders, and, arrangers, count, basie, cab, calloway, jimmy, and, tommy, dorsey, duke, ellington, benny, goodman, fletcher, henderson, earl, hines, harry, james, jimmie, lunceford, glenn, miller, and, artie, shaw, although, it, was, a, collective, sound, swing, also, offered, individual, musicians, a, chance, to, solo, and, improvise, melodic, thematic, solos, which, could, at, times, be, complex, important, music, over, time, social, strictures, regarding, racial, segregation, began, to, relax, in, america, white, bandleaders, began, to, recruit, black, musicians, and, black, bandleaders, white, ones, in, the, mid, 1930s, benny, goodman, hired, pianist, teddy, wilson, vibraphonist, lionel, hampton, and, guitarist, charlie, christian, to, join, small, groups, in, the, 1930s, kansas, city, jazz, as, exemplified, by, tenor, saxophonist, lester, young, marked, the, transition, from, big, bands, to, the, bebop, influence, of, the, 1940s, an, early, 1940s, style, known, as, jumping, the, blues, or, jump, blues, used, small, combos, uptempo, music, and, blues, chord, progressions, drawing, on, boogie, woogie, from, the, 1930s, while, swing, was, reaching, the, height, of, its, popularity, duke, ellington, spent, the, late, 1920s, and, 1930s, in, washington, d, c, s, jazz, scene, developing, an, innovative, musical, idiom, for, his, orchestra, abandoning, the, conventions, of, swing, he, experimented, with, orchestral, sounds, harmony, and, musical, form, with, complex, compositions, that, still, translated, well, for, popular, audiences, some, of, his, tunes, became, hits, and, his, own, popularity, spanned, from, the, united, states, to, europe, ellington, called, his, music, american, music, rather, than, jazz, and, liked, to, describe, those, who, impressed, him, as, beyond, category, these, included, many, musicians, from, his, orchestra, some, of, whom, are, considered, among, the, best, in, jazz, in, their, own, right, but, it, was, ellington, who, melded, them, into, one, of, the, most, popular, jazz, orchestras, in, the, history, of, jazz, he, often, composed, for, the, style, and, skills, of, these, individuals, such, as, jeep, s, blues, for, johnny, hodges, concerto, for, cootie, for, cootie, williams, which, later, became, do, nothing, till, you, hear, from, me, with, bob, russell, s, lyrics, and, the, mooche, for, tricky, sam, nanton, and, bubber, miley, he, also, recorded, compositions, written, by, his, bandsmen, such, as, juan, tizol, s, caravan, and, perdido, which, brought, the, spanish, tinge, to, big, band, jazz, several, members, of, the, orchestra, remained, with, him, for, several, decades, the, band, reached, a, creative, peak, in, the, early, 1940s, when, ellington, and, a, small, hand, picked, group, of, his, composers, and, arrangers, wrote, for, an, orchestra, of, distinctive, voices, who, displayed, tremendous, creativity, as, only, a, limited, number, of, american, jazz, records, were, released, in, europe, european, jazz, traces, many, of, its, roots, to, american, artists, such, as, james, reese, europe, paul, whiteman, and, lonnie, johnson, who, visited, europe, during, and, after, world, war, i, it, was, their, live, performances, which, inspired, european, audiences, interest, in, jazz, as, well, as, the, interest, in, all, things, american, and, therefore, exotic, which, accompanied, the, economic, and, political, woes, of, europe, during, this, time, the, beginnings, of, a, distinct, european, style, of, jazz, began, to, emerge, in, this, interwar, period, british, jazz, began, with, a, tour, by, the, original, dixieland, jazz, band, in, 1919, in, 1926, fred, elizalde, and, his, cambridge, undergraduates, began, broadcasting, on, the, bbc, thereafter, jazz, became, an, important, element, in, many, leading, dance, orchestras, and, jazz, instrumentalists, became, numerous, this, style, entered, full, swing, in, france, with, the, quintette, du, hot, club, de, france, which, began, in, 1934, much, of, this, french, jazz, was, a, combination, of, african, american, jazz, and, the, symphonic, styles, in, which, french, musicians, were, well, trained, in, this, it, is, easy, to, see, the, inspiration, taken, from, paul, whiteman, since, his, style, was, also, a, fusion, of, the, two, belgian, guitarist, django, reinhardt, popularized, gypsy, jazz, a, mix, of, 1930s, american, swing, french, dance, hall, musette, and, eastern, european, folk, with, a, languid, seductive, feel, the, main, instruments, were, steel, stringed, guitar, violin, and, double, bass, solos, pass, from, one, player, to, another, as, guitar, and, bass, form, the, rhythm, section, some, researchers, believe, eddie, lang, and, joe, venuti, pioneered, the, guitar, violin, partnership, characteristic, of, the, genre, which, was, brought, to, france, after, they, had, been, heard, live, or, on, okeh, records, in, the, late, 1920s, the, outbreak, of, world, war, ii, marked, a, turning, point, for, jazz, the, swing, era, jazz, of, the, previous, decade, had, challenged, other, popular, music, as, being, representative, of, the, nation, s, culture, with, big, bands, reaching, the, height, of, the, style, s, success, by, the, early, 1940s, swing, acts, and, big, bands, traveled, with, u, s, military, overseas, to, europe, where, it, also, became, popular, stateside, however, the, war, presented, difficulties, for, the, big, band, format, conscription, shortened, the, number, of, musicians, available, the, military, s, need, for, shellac, commonly, used, for, pressing, gramophone, records, limited, record, production, a, shortage, of, rubber, also, due, to, the, war, effort, discouraged, bands, from, touring, via, road, travel, and, a, demand, by, the, musicians, union, for, a, commercial, recording, ban, limited, music, distribution, between, 1942, and, 1944, many, of, the, big, bands, who, were, deprived, of, experienced, musicians, because, of, the, war, effort, began, to, enlist, young, players, who, were, below, the, age, for, conscription, as, was, the, case, with, saxophonist, stan, getz, s, entry, in, a, band, as, a, teenager, this, coincided, with, a, nationwide, resurgence, in, the, dixieland, style, of, pre, swing, jazz, performers, such, as, clarinetist, george, lewis, cornetist, bill, davison, and, trombonist, turk, murphy, were, hailed, by, conservative, jazz, critics, as, more, authentic, than, the, big, bands, elsewhere, with, the, limitations, on, recording, small, groups, of, young, musicians, developed, a, more, uptempo, improvisational, style, of, jazz, collaborating, and, experimenting, with, new, ideas, for, melodic, development, rhythmic, language, and, harmonic, substitution, during, informal, late, night, jam, sessions, hosted, in, small, clubs, and, apartments, key, figures, in, this, development, were, largely, based, in, new, york, and, included, pianists, thelonious, monk, and, bud, powell, drummers, max, roach, and, kenny, clarke, saxophonist, charlie, parker, and, trumpeter, dizzy, gillespie, this, musical, development, became, known, as, bebop, bebop, and, subsequent, post, war, jazz, developments, featured, a, wider, set, of, notes, played, in, more, complex, patterns, and, at, faster, tempos, than, previous, jazz, according, to, clive, james, bebop, was, the, post, war, musical, development, which, tried, to, ensure, that, jazz, would, no, longer, be, the, spontaneous, sound, of, joy, students, of, race, relations, in, america, are, generally, agreed, that, the, exponents, of, post, war, jazz, were, determined, with, good, reason, to, present, themselves, as, challenging, artists, rather, than, tame, entertainers, the, end, of, the, war, marked, a, revival, of, the, spirit, of, experimentation, and, musical, pluralism, under, which, it, had, been, conceived, along, with, the, beginning, of, a, decline, in, the, popularity, of, jazz, music, in, america, according, to, american, academic, michael, h, burchett, with, the, rise, of, bebop, and, the, end, of, the, swing, era, after, the, war, jazz, lost, its, cachet, as, pop, music, vocalists, of, the, famous, big, bands, moved, on, to, being, marketed, and, performing, as, solo, pop, singers, these, included, frank, sinatra, peggy, lee, dick, haymes, and, doris, day, older, musicians, who, still, performed, their, pre, war, jazz, such, as, armstrong, and, ellington, were, gradually, viewed, in, the, mainstream, as, pass, other, younger, performers, such, as, singer, big, joe, turner, and, saxophonist, louis, jordan, who, were, discouraged, by, bebop, s, increasing, complexity, pursued, more, lucrative, endeavors, in, rhythm, and, blues, jump, blues, and, eventually, rock, and, roll, some, including, gillespie, composed, intricate, yet, danceable, pieces, for, bebop, musicians, in, an, effort, to, make, them, more, accessible, but, bebop, largely, remained, on, the, fringes, of, american, audiences, purview, the, new, direction, of, postwar, jazz, drew, a, wealth, of, critical, acclaim, but, it, steadily, declined, in, popularity, as, it, developed, a, reputation, as, an, academic, genre, that, was, largely, inaccessible, to, mainstream, audiences, burchett, said, the, quest, to, make, jazz, more, relevant, to, popular, audiences, while, retaining, its, artistic, integrity, is, a, constant, and, prevalent, theme, in, the, history, of, postwar, jazz, during, its, swing, period, jazz, had, been, an, uncomplicated, musical, scene, according, to, paul, trynka, this, changed, in, the, post, war, years, suddenly, jazz, was, no, longer, straightforward, there, was, bebop, and, its, variants, there, was, the, last, gasp, of, swing, there, were, strange, new, brews, like, the, progressive, jazz, of, stan, kenton, and, there, was, a, completely, new, phenomenon, called, revivalism, the, rediscovery, of, jazz, from, the, past, either, on, old, records, or, performed, live, by, aging, players, brought, out, of, retirement, from, now, on, it, was, no, good, saying, that, you, liked, jazz, you, had, to, specify, what, kind, of, jazz, and, that, is, the, way, it, has, been, ever, since, only, more, so, today, the, word, jazz, is, virtually, meaningless, without, further, definition, in, the, early, 1940s, bebop, style, performers, began, to, shift, jazz, from, danceable, popular, music, toward, a, more, challenging, musician, s, music, the, most, influential, bebop, musicians, included, saxophonist, charlie, parker, pianists, bud, powell, and, thelonious, monk, trumpeters, dizzy, gillespie, and, clifford, brown, and, drummer, max, roach, divorcing, itself, from, dance, music, bebop, established, itself, more, as, an, art, form, thus, lessening, its, potential, popular, and, commercial, appeal, composer, gunther, schuller, wrote, in, 1943, i, heard, the, great, earl, hines, band, which, had, bird, in, it, and, all, those, other, great, musicians, they, were, playing, all, the, flatted, fifth, chords, and, all, the, modern, harmonies, and, substitutions, and, dizzy, gillespie, runs, in, the, trumpet, section, work, two, years, later, i, read, that, that, was, bop, and, the, beginning, of, modern, jazz, but, the, band, never, made, recordings, dizzy, gillespie, wrote, people, talk, about, the, hines, band, being, the, incubator, of, bop, and, the, leading, exponents, of, that, music, ended, up, in, the, hines, band, but, people, also, have, the, erroneous, impression, that, the, music, was, new, it, was, not, the, music, evolved, from, what, went, before, it, was, the, same, basic, music, the, difference, was, in, how, you, got, from, here, to, here, to, here, naturally, each, age, has, got, its, own, shit, since, bebop, was, meant, to, be, listened, to, not, danced, to, it, could, use, faster, tempos, drumming, shifted, to, a, more, elusive, and, explosive, style, in, which, the, ride, cymbal, was, used, to, keep, time, while, the, snare, and, bass, drum, were, used, for, accents, this, led, to, a, highly, syncopated, music, with, a, linear, rhythmic, complexity, bebop, musicians, employed, several, harmonic, devices, which, were, not, previously, typical, in, jazz, engaging, in, a, more, abstracted, form, of, chord, based, improvisation, bebop, scales, are, traditional, scales, with, an, added, chromatic, passing, note, bebop, also, uses, passing, chords, substitute, chords, and, altered, chords, new, forms, of, chromaticism, and, dissonance, were, introduced, into, jazz, and, the, dissonant, tritone, or, flatted, fifth, interval, became, the, most, important, interval, of, bebop, chord, progressions, for, bebop, tunes, were, often, taken, directly, from, popular, swing, era, tunes, and, reused, with, a, new, and, more, complex, melody, or, reharmonized, with, more, complex, chord, progressions, to, form, new, compositions, a, practice, which, was, already, well, established, in, earlier, jazz, but, came, to, be, central, to, the, bebop, style, bebop, made, use, of, several, relatively, common, chord, progressions, such, as, blues, at, base, i, iv, v, but, often, infused, with, ii, v, motion, and, rhythm, changes, i, vi, ii, v, the, chords, to, the, 1930s, pop, standard, i, got, rhythm, late, bop, also, moved, towards, extended, forms, that, represented, a, departure, from, pop, and, show, tunes, the, harmonic, development, in, bebop, is, often, traced, back, to, a, moment, experienced, by, charlie, parker, while, performing, cherokee, at, clark, monroe, s, uptown, house, new, york, in, early, 1942, i, d, been, getting, bored, with, the, stereotyped, changes, that, were, being, used, and, i, kept, thinking, there, s, bound, to, be, something, else, i, could, hear, it, sometimes, i, couldn, t, play, it, i, was, working, over, cherokee, and, as, i, did, i, found, that, by, using, the, higher, intervals, of, a, chord, as, a, melody, line, and, backing, them, with, appropriately, related, changes, i, could, play, the, thing, i, d, been, hearing, it, came, alive, gerhard, kubik, postulates, that, harmonic, development, in, bebop, sprang, from, blues, and, african, related, tonal, sensibilities, rather, than, 20th, century, western, classical, music, auditory, inclinations, were, the, african, legacy, in, life, reconfirmed, by, the, experience, of, the, blues, tonal, system, a, sound, world, at, odds, with, the, western, diatonic, chord, categories, bebop, musicians, eliminated, western, style, functional, harmony, in, their, music, while, retaining, the, strong, central, tonality, of, the, blues, as, a, basis, for, drawing, upon, various, african, matrices, samuel, floyd, states, that, blues, was, both, the, bedrock, and, propelling, force, of, bebop, bringing, about, a, new, harmonic, conception, using, extended, chord, structures, that, led, to, unprecedented, harmonic, and, melodic, variety, a, developed, and, even, more, highly, syncopated, linear, rhythmic, complexity, and, a, melodic, angularity, in, which, the, blue, note, of, the, fifth, degree, was, established, as, an, important, melodic, harmonic, device, and, reestablishment, of, the, blues, as, the, primary, organizing, and, functional, principle, kubik, wrote, while, for, an, outside, observer, the, harmonic, innovations, in, bebop, would, appear, to, be, inspired, by, experiences, in, western, serious, music, from, claude, debussy, to, arnold, schoenberg, such, a, scheme, cannot, be, sustained, by, the, evidence, from, a, cognitive, approach, claude, debussy, did, have, some, influence, on, jazz, for, example, on, bix, beiderbecke, s, piano, playing, and, it, is, also, true, that, duke, ellington, adopted, and, reinterpreted, some, harmonic, devices, in, european, contemporary, music, west, coast, jazz, would, run, into, such, debts, as, would, several, forms, of, cool, jazz, but, bebop, has, hardly, any, such, debts, in, the, sense, of, direct, borrowings, on, the, contrary, ideologically, bebop, was, a, strong, statement, of, rejection, of, any, kind, of, eclecticism, propelled, by, a, desire, to, activate, something, deeply, buried, in, self, bebop, then, revived, tonal, harmonic, ideas, transmitted, through, the, blues, and, reconstructed, and, expanded, others, in, a, basically, non, western, harmonic, approach, the, ultimate, significance, of, all, this, is, that, the, experiments, in, jazz, during, the, 1940s, brought, back, to, african, american, music, several, structural, principles, and, techniques, rooted, in, african, traditions, these, divergences, from, the, jazz, mainstream, of, the, time, met, a, divided, sometimes, hostile, response, among, fans, and, musicians, especially, swing, players, who, bristled, at, the, new, harmonic, sounds, to, hostile, critics, bebop, seemed, filled, with, racing, nervous, phrases, but, despite, the, friction, by, the, 1950s, bebop, had, become, an, accepted, part, of, the, jazz, vocabulary, the, general, consensus, among, musicians, and, musicologists, is, that, the, first, original, jazz, piece, to, be, overtly, based, in, clave, was, tanga, 1943, composed, by, cuban, born, mario, bauza, and, recorded, by, machito, and, his, afro, cubans, in, new, york, city, tanga, began, as, a, spontaneous, descarga, cuban, jam, session, with, jazz, solos, superimposed, on, top, this, was, the, birth, of, afro, cuban, jazz, the, use, of, clave, brought, the, african, timeline, or, key, pattern, into, jazz, music, organized, around, key, patterns, convey, a, two, celled, binary, structure, which, is, a, complex, level, of, african, cross, rhythm, within, the, context, of, jazz, however, harmony, is, the, primary, referent, not, rhythm, the, harmonic, progression, can, begin, on, either, side, of, clave, and, the, harmonic, one, is, always, understood, to, be, one, if, the, progression, begins, on, the, three, side, of, clave, it, is, said, to, be, in, 3, 2, clave, shown, below, if, the, progression, begins, on, the, two, side, it, is, in, 2, 3, clave, mario, bauz, introduced, bebop, innovator, dizzy, gillespie, to, cuban, conga, drummer, and, composer, chano, pozo, gillespie, and, pozo, s, brief, collaboration, produced, some, of, the, most, enduring, afro, cuban, jazz, standards, manteca, 1947, is, the, first, jazz, standard, to, be, rhythmically, based, on, clave, according, to, gillespie, pozo, composed, the, layered, contrapuntal, guajeos, afro, cuban, ostinatos, of, the, a, section, and, the, introduction, while, gillespie, wrote, the, bridge, gillespie, recounted, if, i, d, let, it, go, like, wanted, it, it, would, have, been, strictly, afro, cuban, all, the, way, there, wouldn, t, have, been, a, bridge, i, thought, i, was, writing, an, eight, bar, bridge, but, i, had, to, keep, going, and, ended, up, writing, a, sixteen, bar, bridge, the, bridge, gave, manteca, a, typical, jazz, harmonic, structure, setting, the, piece, apart, from, bauza, s, modal, tanga, of, a, few, years, earlier, gillespie, s, collaboration, with, pozo, brought, specific, african, based, rhythms, into, bebop, while, pushing, the, boundaries, of, harmonic, improvisation, cu, bop, also, drew, from, african, rhythm, jazz, arrangements, with, a, latin, a, section, and, a, swung, b, section, with, all, choruses, swung, during, solos, became, common, practice, with, many, latin, tunes, of, the, jazz, standard, repertoire, this, approach, can, be, heard, on, pre, 1980, recordings, of, manteca, a, night, in, tunisia, tin, tin, deo, and, on, green, dolphin, street, another, jazz, composition, critical, to, the, development, of, afro, cuban, jazz, was, bud, powell, s, un, poco, loco, recorded, with, curley, russell, on, bass, and, max, roach, on, drums, noted, for, its, frenetic, energy, and, clanging, cowbell, and, polyrhythmic, accompaniment, the, composition, combined, afro, cuban, rhythm, with, polytonality, and, preceded, further, use, of, modality, and, avant, garde, harmony, in, latin, jazz, cuban, percussionist, mongo, santamaria, first, recorded, his, composition, afro, blue, in, 1959, afro, blue, was, the, first, jazz, standard, built, upon, a, typical, african, three, against, two, 3, 2, cross, rhythm, or, hemiola, the, piece, begins, with, the, bass, repeatedly, playing, 6, cross, beats, per, each, measure, of, 12, 8, or, 6, cross, beats, per, 4, main, beats, 6, 4, two, cells, of, 3, 2, the, following, example, shows, the, original, ostinato, afro, blue, bass, line, the, cross, noteheads, indicate, the, main, beats, not, bass, notes, when, john, coltrane, covered, afro, blue, in, 1963, he, inverted, the, metric, hierarchy, interpreting, the, tune, as, a, 3, 4, jazz, waltz, with, duple, cross, beats, superimposed, 2, 3, originally, a, b, pentatonic, blues, coltrane, expanded, the, harmonic, structure, of, afro, blue, perhaps, the, most, respected, afro, cuban, jazz, combo, of, the, late, 1950s, was, vibraphonist, cal, tjader, s, band, tjader, had, mongo, santamaria, armando, peraza, and, willie, bobo, on, his, early, recording, dates, in, the, late, 1940s, there, was, a, revival, of, dixieland, harking, back, to, the, contrapuntal, new, orleans, style, this, was, driven, in, large, part, by, record, company, reissues, of, jazz, classics, by, the, oliver, morton, and, armstrong, bands, of, the, 1930s, there, were, two, types, of, musicians, involved, in, the, revival, the, first, group, was, made, up, of, those, who, had, begun, their, careers, playing, in, the, traditional, style, and, were, returning, to, it, or, continuing, what, they, had, been, playing, all, along, such, as, bob, crosby, s, bobcats, max, kaminsky, eddie, condon, and, wild, bill, davison, most, of, these, players, were, originally, midwesterners, although, there, were, a, small, number, of, new, orleans, musicians, involved, the, second, group, of, revivalists, consisted, of, younger, musicians, such, as, those, in, the, lu, watters, band, conrad, janis, and, ward, kimball, and, his, firehouse, five, plus, two, jazz, band, by, the, late, 1940s, louis, armstrong, s, allstars, band, became, a, leading, ensemble, through, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, dixieland, was, one, of, the, most, commercially, popular, jazz, styles, in, the, us, europe, and, japan, although, critics, paid, little, attention, to, it, hard, bop, is, an, extension, of, bebop, or, bop, music, that, incorporates, influences, from, blues, rhythm, and, blues, and, gospel, especially, in, saxophone, and, piano, playing, hard, bop, was, developed, in, the, mid, 1950s, coalescing, in, 1953, and, 1954, it, developed, partly, in, response, to, the, vogue, for, cool, jazz, in, the, early, 1950s, and, paralleled, the, rise, of, rhythm, and, blues, it, has, been, described, as, funky, and, can, be, considered, a, relative, of, soul, jazz, some, elements, of, the, genre, were, simplified, from, their, bebop, roots, miles, davis, 1954, performance, of, walkin, at, the, first, newport, jazz, festival, introduced, the, style, to, the, jazz, world, further, leaders, of, hard, bop, s, development, included, the, clifford, brown, max, roach, quintet, art, blakey, s, jazz, messengers, the, horace, silver, quintet, and, trumpeters, lee, morgan, and, freddie, hubbard, the, late, 1950s, to, early, 1960s, saw, hard, boppers, form, their, own, bands, as, a, new, generation, of, blues, and, bebop, influenced, musicians, entered, the, jazz, world, from, pianists, wynton, kelly, and, tommy, flanagan, to, saxophonists, joe, henderson, and, hank, mobley, coltrane, johnny, griffin, mobley, and, morgan, all, participated, on, the, album, a, blowin, session, 1957, considered, by, al, campbell, to, have, been, one, of, the, high, points, of, the, hard, bop, era, hard, bop, was, prevalent, within, jazz, for, about, a, decade, spanning, from, 1955, to, 1965, but, has, remained, highly, influential, on, mainstream, or, straight, ahead, jazz, it, went, into, decline, in, the, late, 1960s, through, the, 1970s, due, to, the, emergence, of, other, styles, such, as, jazz, fusion, but, again, became, influential, following, the, young, lions, movement, and, the, emergence, of, neo, bop, modal, jazz, is, a, development, which, began, in, the, later, 1950s, which, takes, the, mode, or, musical, scale, as, the, basis, of, musical, structure, and, improvisation, previously, a, solo, was, meant, to, fit, into, a, given, chord, progression, but, with, modal, jazz, the, soloist, creates, a, melody, using, one, or, a, small, number, of, modes, the, emphasis, is, thus, shifted, from, harmony, to, melody, historically, this, caused, a, seismic, shift, among, jazz, musicians, away, from, thinking, vertically, the, chord, and, towards, a, more, horizontal, approach, the, scale, explained, pianist, mark, levine, the, modal, theory, stems, from, a, work, by, george, russell, miles, davis, introduced, the, concept, to, the, greater, jazz, world, with, kind, of, blue, 1959, an, exploration, of, the, possibilities, of, modal, jazz, which, would, become, the, best, selling, jazz, album, of, all, time, in, contrast, to, davis, earlier, work, with, hard, bop, and, its, complex, chord, progression, and, improvisation, kind, of, blue, was, composed, as, a, series, of, modal, sketches, in, which, the, musicians, were, given, scales, that, defined, the, parameters, of, their, improvisation, and, style, i, didn, t, write, out, the, music, for, kind, of, blue, but, brought, in, sketches, for, what, everybody, was, supposed, to, play, because, i, wanted, a, lot, of, spontaneity, recalled, davis, the, track, so, what, has, only, two, chords, d, 7, and, e, 7, other, innovators, in, this, style, include, jackie, mclean, and, two, of, the, musicians, who, had, also, played, on, kind, of, blue, john, coltrane, and, bill, evans, free, jazz, and, the, related, form, of, avant, garde, jazz, broke, through, into, an, open, space, of, free, tonality, in, which, meter, beat, and, formal, symmetry, all, disappeared, and, a, range, of, world, music, from, india, africa, and, arabia, were, melded, into, an, intense, even, religiously, ecstatic, or, orgiastic, style, of, playing, while, loosely, inspired, by, bebop, free, jazz, tunes, gave, players, much, more, latitude, the, loose, harmony, and, tempo, was, deemed, controversial, when, this, approach, was, first, developed, the, bassist, charles, mingus, is, also, frequently, associated, with, the, avant, garde, in, jazz, although, his, compositions, draw, from, myriad, styles, and, genres, the, first, major, stirrings, came, in, the, 1950s, with, the, early, work, of, ornette, coleman, whose, 1960, album, free, jazz, a, collective, improvisation, coined, the, term, and, cecil, taylor, in, the, 1960s, exponents, included, albert, ayler, gato, barbieri, carla, bley, don, cherry, larry, coryell, john, coltrane, bill, dixon, jimmy, giuffre, steve, lacy, michael, mantler, sun, ra, roswell, rudd, pharoah, sanders, and, john, tchicai, in, developing, his, late, style, coltrane, was, especially, influenced, by, the, dissonance, of, ayler, s, trio, with, bassist, gary, peacock, and, drummer, sunny, murray, a, rhythm, section, honed, with, cecil, taylor, as, leader, in, november, 1961, coltrane, played, a, gig, at, the, village, vanguard, which, resulted, in, the, classic, chasin, the, trane, which, downbeat, magazine, panned, as, anti, jazz, on, his, 1961, tour, of, france, he, was, booed, but, persevered, signing, with, the, new, impulse, records, in, 1960, and, turning, it, into, the, house, that, trane, built, while, championing, many, younger, free, jazz, musicians, notably, archie, shepp, who, often, played, with, trumpeter, bill, dixon, who, organized, the, 4, day, october, revolution, in, jazz, in, manhattan, in, 1964, the, first, free, jazz, festival, a, series, of, recordings, with, the, classic, quartet, in, the, first, half, of, 1965, show, coltrane, s, playing, becoming, increasingly, abstract, with, greater, incorporation, of, devices, like, multiphonics, utilization, of, overtones, and, playing, in, the, altissimo, register, as, well, as, a, mutated, return, to, coltrane, s, sheets, of, sound, in, the, studio, he, all, but, abandoned, his, soprano, to, concentrate, on, the, tenor, saxophone, in, addition, the, quartet, responded, to, the, leader, by, playing, with, increasing, freedom, the, group, s, evolution, can, be, traced, through, the, recordings, the, john, coltrane, quartet, plays, living, space, and, transition, both, june, 1965, new, thing, at, newport, july, 1965, sun, ship, august, 1965, and, first, meditations, september, 1965, in, june, 1965, coltrane, and, 10, other, musicians, recorded, ascension, a, 40, minute, long, piece, without, breaks, that, included, adventurous, solos, by, young, avant, garde, musicians, as, well, as, coltrane, and, was, controversial, primarily, for, the, collective, improvisation, sections, that, separated, the, solos, dave, liebman, later, called, it, the, torch, that, lit, the, free, jazz, thing, after, recording, with, the, quartet, over, the, next, few, months, coltrane, invited, pharoah, sanders, to, join, the, band, in, september, 1965, while, coltrane, used, over, blowing, frequently, as, an, emotional, exclamation, point, sanders, would, opt, to, overblow, his, entire, solo, resulting, in, a, constant, screaming, and, screeching, in, the, altissimo, range, of, the, instrument, free, jazz, was, played, in, europe, in, part, because, musicians, such, as, ayler, taylor, steve, lacy, and, eric, dolphy, spent, extended, periods, of, time, there, and, european, musicians, such, as, michael, mantler, and, john, tchicai, traveled, to, the, u, s, to, experience, american, music, firsthand, european, contemporary, jazz, was, shaped, by, peter, br, tzmann, john, surman, krzysztof, komeda, zbigniew, namys, owski, tomasz, stanko, lars, gullin, joe, harriott, albert, mangelsdorff, kenny, wheeler, graham, collier, michael, garrick, and, mike, westbrook, they, were, eager, to, develop, approaches, to, music, that, reflected, their, heritage, since, the, 1960s, creative, centers, of, jazz, in, europe, have, developed, such, as, the, creative, jazz, scene, in, amsterdam, following, the, work, of, drummer, han, bennink, and, pianist, misha, mengelberg, musicians, started, to, explore, by, improvising, collectively, until, a, form, melody, rhythm, a, famous, song, is, found, jazz, critic, kevin, whitehead, documented, the, free, jazz, scene, in, amsterdam, and, some, of, its, main, exponents, such, as, the, icp, instant, composers, pool, orchestra, in, his, book, new, dutch, swing, since, the, 1990s, keith, jarrett, has, defended, free, jazz, from, criticism, british, writer, stuart, nicholson, has, argued, european, contemporary, jazz, has, an, identity, different, from, american, jazz, and, follows, a, different, trajectory, latin, jazz, is, jazz, that, employs, latin, american, rhythms, and, is, generally, understood, to, have, a, more, specific, meaning, than, simply, jazz, from, latin, america, a, more, precise, term, might, be, afro, latin, jazz, as, the, jazz, subgenre, typically, employs, rhythms, that, either, have, a, direct, analog, in, africa, or, exhibit, an, african, rhythmic, influence, beyond, what, is, ordinarily, heard, in, other, jazz, the, two, main, categories, of, latin, jazz, are, afro, cuban, jazz, and, brazilian, jazz, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, many, jazz, musicians, had, only, a, basic, understanding, of, cuban, and, brazilian, music, and, jazz, compositions, which, used, cuban, or, brazilian, elements, were, often, referred, to, as, latin, tunes, with, no, distinction, between, a, cuban, son, montuno, and, a, brazilian, bossa, nova, even, as, late, as, 2000, in, mark, gridley, s, jazz, styles, history, and, analysis, a, bossa, nova, bass, line, is, referred, to, as, a, latin, bass, figure, it, was, not, uncommon, during, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, to, hear, a, conga, playing, a, cuban, tumbao, while, the, drumset, and, bass, played, a, brazilian, bossa, nova, pattern, many, jazz, standards, such, as, manteca, on, green, dolphin, street, and, song, for, my, father, have, a, latin, a, section, and, a, swung, b, section, typically, the, band, would, only, play, an, even, eighth, latin, feel, in, the, a, section, of, the, head, and, swing, throughout, all, of, the, solos, latin, jazz, specialists, like, cal, tjader, tended, to, be, the, exception, for, example, on, a, 1959, live, tjader, recording, of, a, night, in, tunisia, pianist, vince, guaraldi, soloed, through, the, entire, form, over, an, authentic, mambo, for, most, of, its, history, afro, cuban, jazz, had, been, a, matter, of, superimposing, jazz, phrasing, over, cuban, rhythms, but, by, the, end, of, the, 1970s, a, new, generation, of, new, york, city, musicians, had, emerged, who, were, fluent, in, both, salsa, dance, music, and, jazz, leading, to, a, new, level, of, integration, of, jazz, and, cuban, rhythms, this, era, of, creativity, and, vitality, is, best, represented, by, the, gonzalez, brothers, jerry, congas, and, trumpet, and, andy, bass, during, 1974, 1976, they, were, members, of, one, of, eddie, palmieri, s, most, experimental, salsa, groups, salsa, was, the, medium, but, palmieri, was, stretching, the, form, in, new, ways, he, incorporated, parallel, fourths, with, mccoy, tyner, type, vamps, the, innovations, of, palmieri, the, gonzalez, brothers, and, others, led, to, an, afro, cuban, jazz, renaissance, in, new, york, city, this, occurred, in, parallel, with, developments, in, cuba, the, first, cuban, band, of, this, new, wave, was, irakere, their, ch, kere, son, 1976, introduced, a, style, of, cubanized, bebop, flavored, horn, lines, that, departed, from, the, more, angular, guajeo, based, lines, which, were, typical, of, cuban, popular, music, and, latin, jazz, up, until, that, time, it, was, based, on, charlie, parker, s, composition, billie, s, bounce, jumbled, together, in, a, way, that, fused, clave, and, bebop, horn, lines, in, spite, of, the, ambivalence, of, some, band, members, towards, irakere, s, afro, cuban, folkloric, jazz, fusion, their, experiments, forever, changed, cuban, jazz, their, innovations, are, still, heard, in, the, high, level, of, harmonic, and, rhythmic, complexity, in, cuban, jazz, and, in, the, jazzy, and, complex, contemporary, form, of, popular, dance, music, known, as, timba, brazilian, jazz, such, as, bossa, nova, is, derived, from, samba, with, influences, from, jazz, and, other, 20th, century, classical, and, popular, music, styles, bossa, is, generally, moderately, paced, with, melodies, sung, in, portuguese, or, english, whilst, the, related, jazz, samba, is, an, adaptation, of, street, samba, into, jazz, the, bossa, nova, style, was, pioneered, by, brazilians, jo, o, gilberto, and, ant, nio, carlos, jobim, and, was, made, popular, by, elizete, cardoso, s, recording, of, chega, de, saudade, on, the, can, o, do, amor, demais, lp, gilberto, s, initial, releases, and, the, 1959, film, black, orpheus, achieved, significant, popularity, in, latin, america, this, spread, to, north, america, via, visiting, american, jazz, musicians, the, resulting, recordings, by, charlie, byrd, and, stan, getz, cemented, bossa, nova, s, popularity, and, led, to, a, worldwide, boom, with, 1963, s, getz, gilberto, numerous, recordings, by, famous, jazz, performers, such, as, ella, fitzgerald, and, frank, sinatra, and, the, eventual, entrenchment, of, the, bossa, nova, style, as, a, lasting, influence, in, world, music, brazilian, percussionists, such, as, airto, moreira, and, nan, vasconcelos, also, influenced, jazz, internationally, by, introducing, afro, brazilian,

namely, those, from, outside, of, brazil, it, has, been, rejected, by, many, prominent, bossa, nova, musicians, such, as, jobim, who, once, said, bossa, nova, is, not, brazilian, jazz, the, first,

keep, time, the, use, of, pentatonic, scales, was, another, trend, associated, with, africa, the, use, of, pentatonic, scales, in, africa, probably, goes, back, thousands, of, years, mccoy, tyner, perfected, the, use, of, the, pentatonic, scale, in, his, solos, and, also, used, parallel, fifths, and, fourths, which, are, common, harmonies, in, west, africa, the, minor, pentatonic, scale, is, often, used, in, blues, improvisation, and, like, a, blues, scale, a, minor, pentatonic, scale, can, be, played, over, all, of, the, chords, in, a, blues, the, following, pentatonic, lick, was, played, over, blues, changes, by, joe, henderson, on, horace, silver, s, african, queen, 1965, jazz, pianist, theorist, and, educator, mark, levine, refers, to, the, scale, generated, by, beginning, on, the, fifth, step, of, a, pentatonic, scale, as, the, v, pentatonic, scale, levine, points, out, that, the, v, pentatonic, scale, works, for, all, three, chords, of, the, standard, ii, v, i, jazz, progression, this, is, a, very, common, progression, used, in, pieces, such, as, miles, davis, tune, up, the, following, example, shows, the, v, pentatonic, scale, over, a, ii, v, i, progression, accordingly, john, coltrane, s, giant, steps, 1960, with, its, 26, chords, per, 16, bars, can, be, played, using, only, three, pentatonic, scales, coltrane, studied, nicolas, slonimsky, s, thesaurus,

most, advanced, 20th, century, art, music, superimposing, the, pentatonic, scale, over, giant, steps, is, not, merely, a, matter, of, harmonic, simplification, but, also, a, sort, of, africanizing, of, the, piece, which, provides, an, alternate, approach, for, soloing, mark, levine, observes, that, when, mixed, in, with, more, conventional, playing, the, changes, pentatonic, scales, provide, structure, and, a, feeling, of, increased, space, as, noted, above, jazz, has, incorporated, from, its, inception, aspects, of, african, american, sacred, music, including, spirituals, and, hymns, secular, jazz, musicians, often, performed, renditions, of, spirituals, and, hymns, as, part, of, their, repertoire, or, isolated, compositions, such, as, come, sunday, part, of, black, and, beige, suite, by, duke, ellington, later, many, other, jazz, artists, borrowed, from, black, gospel, music, however, it, was, only, after, world, war, ii, that, a, few, jazz, musicians, began, to, compose, and, perform, extended, works, intended, for, religious, settings, or, as, religious, expression, since, the, 1950s, sacred, and, liturgical, music, has, been, performed, and, recorded, by, many, prominent, jazz, composers, and, musicians, the, abyssinian, mass, by, wynton, marsalis, blueengine, records, 2016, is, a, recent, example, relatively, little, has, been, written, about, sacred, and, liturgical, jazz, in, a, 2013, doctoral, dissertation, angelo, versace, examined, the, development, of, sacred, jazz, in, the, 1950s, using, disciplines, of, musicology, and, history, he, noted, that, the, traditions, of, black, gospel, music, and, jazz, were, combined, in, the, 1950s, to, produce, a, new, genre, sacred, jazz, versace, maintained, that, the, religious, intent, separates, sacred, from, secular, jazz, most, prominent, in, initiating, the, sacred, jazz, movement, were, pianist, and, composer, mary, lou, williams, known, for, her, jazz, masses, in, the, 1950s, and, duke, ellington, prior, to, his, death, in, 1974, in, response, to, contacts, from, grace, cathedral, in, san, francisco, duke, ellington, wrote, three, sacred, concerts, 1965, a, concert, of, sacred, music, 1968, second, sacred, concert, 1973, third, sacred, concert, the, most, prominent, form, of, sacred, and, liturgical, jazz, is, the, jazz, mass, although, most, often, performed, in, a, concert, setting, rather, than, church, worship, setting, this, form, has, many, examples, an, eminent, example, of, composers, of, the, jazz, mass, was, mary, lou, williams, williams, converted, to, catholicism, in, 1957, and, proceeded, to, compose, three, masses, in, the, jazz, idiom, one, was, composed, in, 1968, to, honor, the, recently, assassinated, martin, luther, king, jr, and, the, third, was, commissioned, by, a, pontifical, commission, it, was, performed, once, in, 1975, in, st, patrick, s, cathedral, in, new, york, city, however, the, catholic, church, has, not, embraced, jazz, as, appropriate, for, worship, in, 1966, joe, masters, recorded, jazz, mass, for, columbia, records, a, jazz, ensemble, was, joined, by, soloists, and, choir, using, the, english, text, of, the, roman, catholic, mass, other, examples, include, jazz, mass, in, concert, by, lalo, schiffrin, aleph, records, 1998, upc, 0651702632725, and, jazz, mass, by, vince, guaraldi, fantasy, records, 1965,

ike, sturm, and, new, york, composer, deanna, witkowski, as, contemporary, exemplars, of, sacred, and, liturgical, jazz, in, the, late, 1960s, and, early, 1970s, the, hybrid, form, of, jazz, rock, fusion, was, developed, by, combining, jazz, improvisation, with, rock, rhythms, electric, instruments, and, the, highly, amplified, stage, sound, of, rock, musicians, such, as, jimi, hendrix, and, frank, zappa, jazz, fusion, often, uses, mixed, meters, odd, time, signatures, syncopation, complex, chords, and, harmonies, according, to, allmusic, until, around, 1967, the, worlds, of, jazz, and, rock, were, nearly, completely, separate, as, rock, became, more, creative, and, its, musicianship, improved, and, as, some, in, the, jazz, world, became, bored, with, hard, bop, and, did, not, want, to, play, strictly, avant, garde, music, the, two, different, idioms, began, to, trade, ideas, and, occasionally, combine, forces, in, 1969, davis, fully, embraced, the, electric, instrument, approach, to, jazz, with, in, a, silent, way, which, can, be, considered, his, first, fusion, album, composed, of, two, side, long, suites, edited, heavily, by, producer, teo, macero, this, quiet, static, album, would, be, equally, influential, to, the, development, of, ambient, music, as, davis, recalls, the, music, i, was, really, listening, to, in, 1968, was, james, brown, the, great, guitar, player, jimi, hendrix, and, a, new, group, who, had, just, come, out, with, a, hit, record, dance, to, the, music, sly, and, the, family, stone, i, wanted, to, make, it, more, like, rock, when, we, recorded, in, a, silent, way, i, just, threw, out, all, the, chord, sheets, and, told, everyone, to, play, off, of, that, two, contributors, to, in, a, silent, way, also, joined, organist, larry, young, to, create, one, of, the, early, acclaimed, fusion, albums, emergency, 1969, by, the, tony, williams, lifetime, weather, report, s, self, titled, electronic, and, psychedelic, weather, report, debut, album, caused, a, sensation, in, the, jazz, world, on, its, arrival, in, 1971, thanks, to, the, pedigree, of, the, group, s, members, including, percussionist, airto, moreira, and, their, unorthodox, approach, to, music, the, album, featured, a, softer, sound, than, would, be, the, case, in, later, years, predominantly, using, acoustic, bass, with, shorter, exclusively, playing, soprano, saxophone, and, with, no, synthesizers, involved, but, is, still, considered, a, classic, of, early, fusion, it, built, on, the, avant, garde, experiments, which, joe, zawinul, and, shorter, had, pioneered, with, miles, davis, on, bitches, brew, including, an, avoidance, of, head, and, chorus, composition, in, favor, of, continuous, rhythm, and, movement, but, took, the, music, further, to, emphasize, the, group, s, rejection, of, standard, methodology, the, album, opened, with, the, inscrutable, avant, garde, atmospheric, piece, milky, way, which, featured, by, shorter, s, extremely, muted, saxophone, inducing, vibrations, in, zawinul, s, piano, strings, while, the, latter, pedaled, the, instrument, downbeat, described, the, album, as, music, beyond, category, and, awarded, it, album, of, the, year, in, the, magazine, s, polls, that, year, weather, report, s, subsequent, releases, were, creative, funk, jazz, works, although, some, jazz, purists, protested, against, the, blend, of, jazz, and, rock, many, jazz, innovators, crossed, over, from, the, contemporary, hard, bop, scene, into, fusion, as, well, as, the, electric, instruments, of, rock, such, as, electric, guitar, electric, bass, electric, piano, and, synthesizer, keyboards, fusion, also, used, the, powerful, amplification, fuzz, pedals, wah, wah, pedals, and, other, effects, that, were, used, by, 1970s, era, rock, bands, notable, performers, of, jazz, fusion, included, miles, davis, eddie, harris, keyboardists, joe, zawinul, chick, corea, and, herbie, hancock, vibraphonist, gary, burton, drummer, tony, williams, violinist, jean, luc, ponty, guitarists, larry, coryell, al, di, meola, john, mclaughlin, ryo, kawasaki, and, frank, zappa, saxophonist, wayne, shorter, and, bassists, jaco, pastorius, and, stanley, clarke, jazz, fusion, was, also, popular, in, japan, where, the, band, casiopea, released, more, than, thirty, fusion, albums, according, to, jazz, writer, stuart, nicholson, just, as, free, jazz, appeared, on, the, verge, of, creating, a, whole, new, musical, language, in, the, 1960s, jazz, rock, briefly, suggested, the, promise, of, doing, the, same, with, albums, such, as, williams, emergency, 1970, and, davis, agharta, 1975, which, nicholson, said, suggested, the, potential, of, evolving, into, something, that, might, eventually, define, itself, as, a, wholly, independent, genre, quite, apart, from, the, sound, and, conventions, of, anything, that, had, gone, before, this, development, was, stifled, by, commercialism, nicholson, said, as, the, genre, mutated, into, a, peculiar, species, of, jazz, inflected, pop, music, that, eventually, took, up, residence, on, fm, radio, at, the, end, of, the, 1970s, although, jazz, rock, fusion, reached, the, height, of, its, popularity, in, the, 1970s, the, use, of, electronic, instruments, and, rock, derived, musical, elements, in, jazz, continued, in, the, 1990s, and, 2000s, musicians, using, this, approach, include, pat, metheny, john, abercrombie, john, scofield, and, the, swedish, group, e, s, t, since, the, beginning, of, the, 1990s, electronic, music, had, significant, technical, improvements, that, popularized, and, created, new, possibilities, for, the, genre, jazz, elements, such, as, improvisation, rhythmic, complexities, and, harmonic, textures, were, introduced, to, the, genre, and, consequently, had, a, big, impact, in, new, listeners, and, in, some, ways, kept, the, versatility, of, jazz, relatable, to, a, newer, generation, that, did, not, necessarily, relate, to, what, the, traditionalists, call, real, jazz, bebop, cool, and, modal, jazz, artists, such, as, squarepusher, aphex, twin, flying, lotus, and, sub, genres, like, idm, drum, n, bass, jungle, and, techno, ended, up, incorporating, a, lot, of, these, elements, squarepusher, being, cited, as, one, big, influence, for, jazz, performers, drummer, mark, guiliana, and, pianist, brad, mehldau, showing, the, correlations, between, jazz, and, electronic, music, are, a, two, way, street, by, the, mid, 1970s, the, sound, known, as, jazz, funk, had, developed, characterized, by, a, strong, back, beat, groove, electrified, sounds, and, often, the, presence, of, electronic, analog, synthesizers, jazz, funk, also, draws, influences, from, traditional, african, music, afro, cuban, rhythms, and, jamaican, reggae, notably, kingston, bandleader, sonny, bradshaw, another, feature, is, the, shift, of, emphasis, from, improvisation, to, composition, arrangements, melody, and, overall, writing, became, important, the, integration, of, funk, soul, and, r, b, music, into, jazz, resulted, in, the, creation, of, a, genre, whose, spectrum, is, wide, and, ranges, from, strong, jazz, improvisation, to, soul, funk, or, disco, with, jazz, arrangements, jazz, riffs, and, jazz, solos, and, sometimes, soul, vocals, early, examples, are, herbie, hancock, s, headhunters, band, and, miles, davis, on, the, corner, album, which, in, 1972, began, davis, foray, into, jazz, funk, and, was, he, claimed, an, attempt, at, reconnecting, with, the, young, black, audience, which, had, largely, forsaken, jazz, for, rock, and, funk, while, there, is, a, discernible, rock, and, funk, influence, in, the, timbres, of, the, instruments, employed, other, tonal, and, rhythmic, textures, such, as, the, indian, tambora, and, tablas, and, cuban, congas, and, bongos, create, a, multi, layered, soundscape, the, album, was, a, culmination, of, sorts, of, the, musique, concr, te, approach, that, davis, and, producer, teo, macero, had, begun, to, explore, in, the, late, 1960s, the, 1980s, saw, something, of, a, reaction, against, the, fusion, and, free, jazz, that, had, dominated, the, 1970s, trumpeter, wynton, marsalis, emerged, early, in, the, decade, and, strove, to, create, music, within, what, he, believed, was, the, tradition, rejecting, both, fusion, and, free, jazz, and, creating, extensions, of, the, small, and, large, forms, initially, pioneered, by, artists, such, as, louis, armstrong, and, duke, ellington, as, well, as, the, hard, bop, of, the, 1950s, it, is, debatable, whether, marsalis, critical, and, commercial, success, was, a, cause, or, a, symptom, of, the, reaction, against, fusion, and, free, jazz, and, the, resurgence, of, interest, in, the, kind, of, jazz, pioneered, in, the, 1960s, particularly, modal, jazz, and, post, bop, nonetheless, there, were, many, other, manifestations, of, a, resurgence, of, traditionalism, even, if, fusion, and, free, jazz, were, by, no, means, abandoned, and, continued, to, develop, and, evolve, for, example, several, musicians, who, had, been, prominent, in, the, fusion, genre, during, the, 1970s, began, to, record, acoustic, jazz, once, more, including, chick, corea, and, herbie, hancock, other, musicians, who, had, experimented, with, electronic, instruments, in, the, previous, decade, had, abandoned, them, by, the, 1980s, for, example, bill, evans, joe, henderson, and, stan, getz, even, the, 1980s, music, of, miles, davis, although, certainly, still, fusion, adopted, a, far, more, accessible, and, recognizably, jazz, oriented, approach, than, his, abstract, work, of, the, mid, 1970s, such, as, a, return, to, a, theme, and, solos, approach, a, similar, reaction, took, place, against, free, jazz, according, to, ted, gioia, the, very, leaders, of, the, avant, garde, started, to, signal, a, retreat, from, the, core, principles, of, free, jazz, anthony, braxton, began, recording, standards, over, familiar, chord, changes, cecil, taylor, played, duets, in, concert, with, mary, lou, williams, and, let, her, set, out, structured, harmonies, and, familiar, jazz, vocabulary, under, his, blistering, keyboard, attack, and, the, next, generation, of, progressive, players, would, be, even, more, accommodating, moving, inside, and, outside, the, changes, without, thinking, twice, musicians, such, as, david, murray, or, don, pullen, may, have, felt, the, call, of, free, form, jazz, but, they, never, forgot, all, the, other, ways, one, could, play, african, american, music, for, fun, and, profit, pianist, keith, jarrett, whose, bands, of, the, 1970s, had, played, only, original, compositions, with, prominent, free, jazz, elements, established, his, so, called, standards, trio, in, 1983, which, although, also, occasionally, exploring, collective, improvisation, has, primarily, performed, and, recorded, jazz, standards, chick, corea, similarly, began, exploring, jazz, standards, in, the, 1980s, having, neglected, them, for, the, 1970s, in, 1987, the, united, states, house, of, representatives, and, senate, passed, a, bill, proposed, by, democratic, representative, john, conyers, jr, to, define, jazz, as, a, unique, form, of, american, music, stating, jazz, is, hereby, designated, as, a, rare, and, valuable, national, american, treasure, to, which, we, should, devote, our, attention, support, and, resources, to, make, certain, it, is, preserved, understood, and, promulgated, it, passed, in, the, house, on, september, 23, 1987, and, in, the, senate, on, november, 4, 1987, in, 2001, ken, burns, s, documentary, jazz, premiered, on, pbs, featuring, wynton, marsalis, and, other, experts, reviewing, the, entire, history, of, american, jazz, to, that, time, it, received, some, criticism, however, for, its, failure, to, reflect, the, many, distinctive, non, american, traditions, and, styles, in, jazz, that, had, developed, and, its, limited, representation, of, us, developments, in, the, last, quarter, of, the, 20th, century, the, emergence, of, young, jazz, talent, beginning, to, perform, in, older, established, musicians, groups, further, impacted, the, resurgence, of, traditionalism, in, the, jazz, community, in, the, 1970s, the, groups, of, betty, carter, and, art, blakey, and, the, jazz, messengers, retained, their, conservative, jazz, approaches, in, the, midst, of, fusion, and, jazz, rock, and, in, addition, to, difficulty, booking, their, acts, struggled, to, find, younger, generations, of, personnel, to, authentically, play, traditional, styles, such, as, hard, bop, and, bebop, in, the, late, 1970s, however, a, resurgence, of, younger, jazz, players, in, blakey, s, band, began, to, occur, this, movement, included, musicians, such, as, valery, ponomarev, and, bobby, watson, dennis, irwin, and, james, williams, in, the, 1980s, in, addition, to, wynton, and, branford, marsalis, the, emergence, of, pianists, in, the, jazz, messengers, such, as, donald, brown, mulgrew, miller, and, later, benny, green, bassists, such, as, charles, fambrough, lonnie, plaxico, and, later, peter, washington, and, essiet, essiet, horn, players, such, as, bill, pierce, donald, harrison, and, later, javon, jackson, and, terence, blanchard, emerged, as, talented, jazz, musicians, all, of, whom, made, significant, contributions, in, the, 1990s, and, 2000s, the, young, jazz, messengers, contemporaries, including, roy, hargrove, marcus, roberts, wallace, roney, and, mark, whitfield, were, also, influenced, by, wynton, marsalis, s, emphasis, toward, jazz, tradition, these, younger, rising, stars, rejected, avant, garde, approaches, and, instead, championed, the, acoustic, jazz, sound, of, charlie, parker, thelonious, monk, and, early, recordings, of, the, first, miles, davis, quintet, this, group, of, young, lions, sought, to, reaffirm, jazz, as, a, high, art, tradition, comparable, to, the, discipline, of, classical, music, in, addition, betty, carter, s, rotation, of, young, musicians, in, her, group, foreshadowed, many, of, new, york, s, preeminent, traditional, jazz, players, later, in, their, careers, among, these, musicians, were, jazz, messenger, alumni, benny, green, branford, marsalis, and, ralph, peterson, jr, as, well, as, kenny, washington, lewis, nash, curtis, lundy, cyrus, chestnut, mark, shim, craig, handy, greg, hutchinson, and, marc, cary, taurus, mateen, and, geri, allen, o, t, b, ensemble, included, a, rotation, of, young, jazz, musicians, such, as, kenny, garrett, steve, wilson, kenny, davis, renee, rosnes, ralph, peterson, jr, billy, drummond, and, robert, hurst, starting, in, the, 1990s, a, number, of, players, from, largely, straight, ahead, or, post, bop, backgrounds, emerged, as, a, result, of, the, rise, of, neo, traditionalist, jazz, including, pianists, jason, moran, and, vijay, iyer, guitarist, kurt, rosenwinkel, vibraphonist, stefon, harris, trumpeters, roy, hargrove,

called, pop, fusion, or, smooth, jazz, became, successful, garnering, significant, radio, airplay, in, quiet, storm, time, slots, at, radio, stations, in, urban, markets, across, the, u, s, this, helped, to, establish, or, bolster, the, careers, of, vocalists, including, al, jarreau, anita, baker, chaka, khan, and, sade, as, well, as, saxophonists, including, grover, washington, jr, kenny, g,

the, prevalent, marginalization, and, malignment, of, smooth, jazz, in, the, standard, jazz, narrative, furthermore, i, question, the, assumption, that, smooth, jazz, is, an, unfortunate, and,
