raymond, carver, and, the, automobile, designs, of, colin, chapman, in, recent, years, minimalism, has, come, to, refer, to, anything, or, anyone, that, is, spare, or, stripped, to, its, essentials, minimalism, in, visual, art, sometimes, called, minimal, art, literalist, art, and, abc, art, refers, to, a, specific, movement, of, artists, that, emerged, in, new, york, in, the, early, 1960s, in,

shapes, often, made, of, industrial, materials, like, plastic, metal, aluminum, concrete, and, fiberglass, these, materials, are, usually, left, raw, or, painted, a, solid, colour, minimalism, was, in, part, a, reaction, against, the, painterly, subjectivity, of, abstract, expressionism, that, had, been, dominant, in, the, new, york, school, during, the, 1940s, and, 1950s, dissatisfied, with, the, intuitive, and, spontaneous, qualities, of, action, painting, and, abstract, expressionism, more, broadly, minimalism, as, an, art, movement, asserted, that, a, work, of, art, should, not, refer, to, anything, other, than, itself, and, should, omit, any, extra, visual, association, donald, judd, s, work, was, showcased, in, 1964, at, green, gallery, in, manhattan, as, were, flavin, s, first, fluorescent, light, works, while, other, leading, manhattan, galleries, like, leo, castelli, gallery, and, pace, gallery, also, began, to, showcase, artists, focused, on, minimalist, ideas, in, a, more, general, sense, minimalism, as, a, visual, strategy, can, be, found, in, the, geometric, abstractions, of, painters, associated, with, the, bauhaus, movement, in, the, works, of, kazimir, malevich, piet, mondrian, and, other, artists, associated, with, the, de, stijl, movement, the, russian, constructivist, movement, and, in, the, work, of, the, romanian, sculptor, constantin, br, ncu, i, minimalism, as, a, formal, strategy, has, been, deployed, in, the, paintings, of, barnett, newman, ad, reinhardt, josef, albers, and, the, works, of, artists, as, diverse, as, pablo, picasso, yayoi, kusama, giorgio, morandi, and, others, yves, klein, had, painted, monochromes, as, early, as, 1949, and, held, the, first, private, exhibition, of, this, work, in, 1950, but, his, first, public, showing, was, the, publication, of, the, artist, s, book, yves, peintures, in, november, 1954, michael, fried, called, the, minimalist, artists, literalists, and, used, literalism, as, a, pejorative, due, to, his, position, that, the, art, should, deliver, transcendental, experience, with, metaphors, symbolism, and, stylization, per, fried, s, controversial, view, the, literalist, art, needs, a, spectator, to, validate, it, as, art, an, object, in, a, situation, only, becomes, art, in, the, eyes, of, an, observer, for, example, for, a, regular, sculpture, its, physical, location, is, irrelevant, and, its, status, as, a, work, of, art, remains, even, when, unseen, the, donald, judd, s, pieces, see, the, photo, on, the, right, on, the, other, hand, are, just, objects, sitting, in, the, desert, sun, waiting, for, a, visitor, to, discover, them, and, accept, them, as, art, the, term, minimalism, is, also, used, to, describe, a, trend, in, design, and, architecture, wherein, the, subject, is, reduced, to, its, necessary, elements, minimalist, architectural, designers, focus, on, the, connection, between, two, perfect, planes, elegant, lighting, and, the, void, spaces, left, by, the, removal, of, three, dimensional, shapes, in, an, architectural, design, minimalist, architecture, became, popular, in, the, late, 1980s, in, london, and, new, york, whereby, architects, and, fashion, designers, worked, together, in, the, boutiques, to, achieve, simplicity, using, white, elements, cold, lighting, and, large, spaces, with, minimal, furniture, and, few, decorative, elements, minimalistic, design, has, been, highly, influenced, by, japanese, traditional, design, and, architecture, the, works, of, de, stijl, artists, are, a, major, reference, de, stijl, expanded, the, ideas, of, expression, by, meticulously, organizing, basic, elements, such, as, lines, and, planes, with, regard, to, home, design, more, attractive, minimalistic, designs, are, not, truly, minimalistic, because, they, are, larger, and, use, more, expensive, building, materials, and, finishes, there, are, observers, who, describe, the, emergence, of, minimalism, as, a, response, to, the, brashness, and, chaos, of, urban, life, in, japan, for, example, minimalist, architecture, began, to, gain, traction, in, the, 1980s, when, its, cities, experienced, rapid, expansion, and, booming, population, the, design, was, considered, an, antidote, to, the, overpowering, presence, of, traffic, advertising, jumbled, building, scales, and, imposing, roadways, the, chaotic, environment, was, not, only, driven, by, urbanization, industrialization, and, technology, but, also, the, japanese, experience, of, constantly, having, to, demolish, structures, on, account, of, the, destruction, wrought, by, world, war, ii, and, the, earthquakes, including, the, calamities, it, entails, such, as, fire, the, minimalist, design, philosophy, did, not, arrive, in, japan, by, way, of, another, country, as, it, was, already, part, of, the, japanese, culture, rooted, on, the, zen, philosophy, there, are, those, who, specifically, attribute, the, design, movement, to, japan, s, spirituality, and, view, of, nature, architect, ludwig, mies, van, der, rohe, 1886, 1969, adopted, the, motto, less, is, more, to, describe, his, aesthetic, his, tactic, was, one, of, arranging, the, necessary, components, of, a, building, to, create, an, impression, of, extreme, simplicity, he, enlisted, every, element, and, detail, to, serve, multiple, visual, and, functional, purposes, for, example, designing, a, floor, to, also, serve, as, the, radiator, or, a, massive, fireplace, to, also, house, the, bathroom, designer, buckminster, fuller, 1895, 1983, adopted, the, engineer, s, goal, of, doing, more, with, less, but, his, concerns, were, oriented, toward, technology, and, engineering, rather, than, aesthetics, the, concept, of, minimalist, architecture, is, to, strip, everything, down, to, its, essential, quality, and, achieve, simplicity, the, idea, is, not, completely, without, ornamentation, but, that, all, parts, details, and, joinery, are, considered, as, reduced, to, a, stage, where, no, one, can, remove, anything, further, to, improve, the, design, the, considerations, for, essences, are, light, form, detail, of, material, space, place, and, human, condition, minimalist, architects, not, only, consider, the, physical, qualities, of, the, building, they, consider, the, spiritual, dimension, and, the, invisible, by, listening, to, the, figure, and, paying, attention, to, details, people, space, nature, and, materials, believing, this, reveals, the, abstract, quality, of, something, that, is, invisible, and, aids, the, search, for, the, essence, of, those, invisible, qualities, such, as, natural, light, sky, earth, and, air, in, addition, they, open, a, dialogue, with, the, surrounding, environment, to, decide, the, most, essential, materials, for, the, construction, and, create, relationships, between, buildings, and, sites, in, minimalist, architecture, design, elements, strive, to, convey, the, message, of, simplicity, the, basic, geometric, forms, elements, without, decoration, simple, materials, and, the, repetitions, of, structures, represent, a, sense, of, order, and, essential, quality, the, movement, of, natural, light, in, buildings, reveals, simple, and, clean, spaces, in, the, late, 19th, century, as, the, arts, and, crafts, movement, became, popular, in, britain, people, valued, the, attitude, of, truth, to, materials, with, respect, to, the, profound, and, innate, characteristics, of, materials, minimalist, architects, humbly, listen, to, figure, seeking, essence, and, simplicity, by, rediscovering, the, valuable, qualities, in, simple, and, common, materials, the, idea, of, simplicity, appears, in, many, cultures, especially, the, japanese, traditional, culture, of, zen, buddhist, philosophy, japanese, manipulate, the, zen, culture, into, aesthetic, and, design, elements, for, their, buildings, this, idea, of, architecture, has, influenced, western, society, especially, in, america, since, the, mid, 18th, century, moreover, it, inspired, the, minimalist, architecture, in, the, 19th, century, zen, concepts, of, simplicity, transmit, the, ideas, of, freedom, and, essence, of, living, simplicity, is, not, only, aesthetic, value, it, has, a, moral, perception, that, looks, into, the, nature, of, truth, and, reveals, the, inner, qualities, and, essence, of, materials, and, objects, for, example, the, sand, garden, in, ry, an, ji, temple, demonstrates, the, concepts, of, simplicity, and, the, essentiality, from, the, considered, setting, of, a, few, stones, and, a, huge, empty, space, the, japanese, aesthetic, principle, of, ma, refers, to, empty, or, open, space, it, removes, all, the, unnecessary, internal, walls, and, opens, up, the, space, the, emptiness, of, spatial, arrangement, reduces, everything, down, to, the, most, essential, quality, the, japanese, aesthetic, of, wabi, sabi, values, the, quality, of, simple, and, plain, objects, it, appreciates, the, absence, of, unnecessary, features, treasures, a, life, in, quietness, and, aims, to, reveal, the, innate, character, of, materials, for, example, the, japanese, floral, art, of, ikebana, has, the, central, principle, of, letting, the, flower, express, itself, people, cut, off, the, branches, leaves, and, blossoms, from, the, plants, and, only, retain, the, essential, part, of, the, plant, this, conveys, the, idea, of, essential, quality, and, innate, character, in, nature, the, japanese, minimalist, architect, tadao, ando, conveys, the, japanese, traditional, spirit, and, his, own, perception, of, nature, in, his, works, his, design, concepts, are, materials, pure, geometry, and, nature, he, normally, uses, concrete, or, natural, wood, and, basic, structural, form, to, achieve, austerity, and, rays, of, light, in, space, he, also, sets, up, dialogue, between, the, site, and, nature, to, create, relationship, and, order, with, the, buildings, ando, s, works, and, the, translation, of, japanese, aesthetic, principles, are, highly, influential, on, japanese, architecture, another, japanese, minimalist, architect, kazuyo, sejima, works, on, her, own, and, in, conjunction, with, ryue, nishizawa, as, sanaa, producing, iconic, japanese, minimalist, buildings, credited, with, creating, and, influencing, a, particular, genre, of, japanese, minimalism, sejimas, delicate, intelligent, designs, may, use, white, color, thin, construction, sections, and, transparent, elements, to, create, the, phenomenal, building, type, often, associated, with, minimalism,

are, to, bring, together, the, relationships, between, building, human, movement, site, and, nature, which, as, one, main, point, of, minimalism, ideology, that, establish, dialogue, between, the, building, and, site, the, building, uses, the, simple, forms, of, circle, and, rectangle, to, contrast, the, filled, and, void, space, of, the, interior, and, nature, in, the, foyer, there, is, a, large, landscape, window, that, looks, out, to, the, exterior, this, achieves, the, simple, and, silence, of, architecture, and, enhances, the, light, wind, time, and, nature, in, space, john, pawson, is, a, british, minimalist, architect, his, design, concepts, are, soul, light, and, order, he, believes, that, though, reduced, clutter, and, simplification, of, the, interior, to, a, point, that, gets, beyond, the, idea, of, essential, quality, there, is, a, sense, of, clarity, and, richness, of, simplicity, instead, of, emptiness, the, materials, in, his, design, reveal, the, perception, toward, space, surface, and, volume, moreover, he, likes, to, use, natural, materials, because, of, their, aliveness, sense, of, depth, and, quality, of, an, individual, he, is, also, attracted, by, the, important, influences, from, japanese, zen, philosophy, calvin, klein, madison, avenue, new, york, 1995, 96, is, a, boutique, that, conveys, calvin, klein, s, ideas, of, fashion, john, pawson, s, interior, design, concepts, for, this, project, are, to, create, simple, peaceful, and, orderly, spatial, arrangements, he, used, stone, floors, and, white, walls, to, achieve, simplicity, and, harmony, for, space, he, also, emphasises, reduction, and, eliminates, the, visual, distortions, such, as, the, air, conditioning, and, lamps, to, achieve, a, sense, of, purity, for, the, interior, alberto, campo, baeza, is, a, spanish, architect, and, describes, his, work, as, essential, architecture, he, values, the, concepts, of, light, idea, and, space, light, is, essential, and, achieves, the, relationship, between, inhabitants, and, the, building, ideas, are, to, meet, the, function, and, context, of, space, forms, and, construction, space, is, shaped, by, the, minimal, geometric, forms, to, avoid, decoration, that, is, not, essential, literary, minimalism, is, characterized, by, an, economy, with, words, and, a, focus, on, surface, description, minimalist, writers, eschew, adverbs, and, prefer, allowing, context, to, dictate, meaning, readers, are, expected, to, take, an, active, role, in, creating, the, story, to, choose, sides, based, on, oblique, hints, and, innuendo, rather, than, react, to, directions, from, the, writer, austrian, architect, and, theorist, adolf, loos, published, early, writings, about, minimalism, in, ornament, and, crime, the, precursors, to, literary, minimalism, are, famous, novelists, stephen, crane, and, ernest, hemingway, some, 1940s, era, crime, fiction, of, writers, such, as, james, m, cain, and, jim, thompson, adopted, a, stripped, down, matter, of, fact, prose, style, to, considerable, effect, some, classify, this, prose, style, as, minimalism, another, strand, of, literary, minimalism, arose, in, response, to, the, metafiction, trend, of, the, 1960s, and, early, 1970s, john, barth, robert, coover, and, william, h, gass, these, writers, were, also, sparse, with, prose, and, kept, a, psychological, distance, from, their, subject, matter, minimalist, writers, or, those, who, are, identified, with, minimalism, during, certain, periods, of, their, writing, careers, include, the,

which, was, earlier, applied, to, the, visual, arts, more, precisely, it, was, in, a, 1968, review, in, the, spectator, that, nyman, first, used, the, term, to, describe, a, ten, minute, piano, composition, by, the, danish, composer, henning, christiansen, along, with, several, other, unnamed, pieces, played, by, charlotte, moorman, and, nam, june, paik, at, the, institute, of, contemporary,

and, 1970s, after, which, it, once, again, gave, way, to, more, traditional, haute, cuisine, retroactively, titled, cuisine, classique, however, the, influence, of, nouvelle, cuisine, can, still, be, felt, through, the, techniques, it, introduced, the, capsule, wardrobe, is, an, example, of, minimalism, in, fashion, constructed, of, only, a, few, staple, pieces, that, do, not, go, out, of, style, and, generally, dominated, by, only, one, or, two, colors, capsule, wardrobes, are, meant, to, be, light, flexible, and, adaptable, and, can, be, paired, with, seasonal, pieces, when, the, situation,

scientists, hawkins, explained, that, our, visual, system, will, do, the, interpretation, of, the, stripes, without, us, even, thinking, about, it, warming, stripe, graphics, resemble, color, field, paintings, in, stripping, out, all, distractions, such, as, actual, data, and, using, only, color, to, convey, meaning, color, field, pioneer, artist, barnett, newman, said, he, was, creating, images, whose, reality, is, self, evident, an, ethos, that, hawkins, is, said, to, have, applied, to, the, problem, of, climate, change, and, leading, one, commentator, to, remark, that, the, graphics, are, fit, for, the, museum, of, modern, art, or, the, getty, a, tempestry, a, portmanteau, of, temperature, and, tapestry, is, a, tapestry, using, stripes, of, specific, colors, of, yarn, to, represent,

materials, which, are, most, essential, and, in, quantities, that, do, not, exceed, certain, limits, imposed, by, the, user, themselves, there, have, been, many, terms, evolved, from, the, concept, like, minimalist, decors, minimalist, skincare, minimalist, style, minimalist, accessories, etc, all, such, terms, signify, the, usage, of, only, essential, products, in, that, niche, into, one, s, life, this, can, help, one, to, focus, on, things, that, are, important, in, one, s, life, it, can, reduce, waste, it, can, also, save, the, time, of, acquiring, the, excess, materials, that, may, be, found, unnecessary, a, minimalist, lifestyle, helps, to, enjoy, life, with, simple, things, that, are, available, without, undue, efforts, to, acquire, things, that, may, be, bought, at, great, expenses, minimalism, also, can, lead, to, less, clutter, in, living, spaces
