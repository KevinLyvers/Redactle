iranian, architecture, or, persian, architecture, persian, me, m, ri, e, ir, ni, is, the, architecture, of, iran, and, parts, of, the, rest, of, west, asia, the, caucasus, and, central, asia, its, history, dates, back, to, at, least, 5, 000, bc, with, characteristic, examples, distributed, over, a, vast, area, from, turkey, and, iraq, to, uzbekistan, and, tajikistan, and, from, the, caucasus, to, zanzibar, persian, buildings, vary, greatly, in, scale, and, function, from, vernacular, architecture, to, monumental, complexes, in, addition, to, historic, gates, palaces, and, mosques, the, rapid, growth, of, cities, such, as, the, capital, tehran, has, brought, about, a, wave, of, demolition, and, new, construction, according, to, american, historian, and, archaeologist, arthur, pope, the, supreme, iranian, art, in, the, proper, meaning, of, the, word, has, always, been, its, architecture, the, supremacy, of, architecture, applies, to, both, pre, and, post, islamic, periods, iranian, architecture, displays, great, variety, both, structural, and, aesthetic, from, a, variety, of, traditions, and, experience, without, sudden, innovations, and, despite, the, repeated, trauma, of, invasions, and, cultural, shocks, it, developed, a, recognizable, style, distinct, from, other, regions, of, the, muslim, world, its, virtues, are, a, marked, feeling, for, form, and, scale, structural, inventiveness, especially, in, vault, and, dome, construction, a, genius, for, decoration, with, a, freedom, and, success, not, rivaled, in, any, other, architecture, traditional, persian, architecture, has, maintained, a, continuity, that, although, temporarily, distracted, by, internal, political, conflicts, or, foreign, invasion, nonetheless, has, achieved, an, unmistakable, style, arthur, pope, a, 20th, century, scholar, of, persian, architecture, described, it, in, these, terms, there, are, no, trivial, buildings, even, garden, pavilions, have, nobility, and, dignity, and, the, humblest, caravanserais, generally, have, charm, in, expressiveness, and, communicativity, most, persian, buildings, are, lucid, even, eloquent, the, combination, of, intensity, and, simplicity, of, form, provides, immediacy, while, ornament, and, often, subtle, proportions, reward, sustained, observation, according, to, scholars, nader, ardalan, and, laleh, bakhtiar, the, guiding, formative, motif, of, iranian, architecture, has, been, its, cosmic, symbolism, by, which, man, is, brought, into, communication, and, participation, with, the, powers, of, heaven, this, theme, has, not, only, given, unity, and, continuity, to, the, architecture, of, persia, but, has, been, a, primary, source, of, its, emotional, character, as, well, available, building, materials, dictate, major, forms, in, traditional, iranian, architecture, heavy, clays, readily, available, at, various, places, throughout, the, plateau, have, encouraged, the, development, of, the, most, primitive, of, all, building, techniques, molded, mud, compressed, as, solidly, as, possible, and, allowed, to, dry, this, technique, used, in, iran, from, ancient, times, has, never, been, completely, abandoned, the, abundance, of, heavy, plastic, earth, in, conjunction, with, a, tenacious, lime, mortar, also, facilitated, the, development, and, use, of, brick, certain, design, elements, of, persian, architecture, have, persisted, throughout, the, history, of, iran, the, most, striking, are, a, marked, feeling, for, scale, and, a, discerning, use, of, simple, and, massive, forms, the, consistency, of, decorative, preferences, the, high, arched, portal, set, within, a, recess, columns, with, bracket, capitals, and, recurrent, types, of, plan, and, elevation, can, also, be, mentioned, through, the, ages, these, elements, have, recurred, in, completely, different, types, of, buildings, constructed, for, various, programs, and, under, the, patronage, of, a, long, succession, of, rulers, the, columned, porch, or, talar, seen, in, the, rock, cut, tombs, near, persepolis, reappear, in, sassanid, temples, and, in, late, islamic, times, it, was, used, as, the, portico, of, a, palace, or, mosque, and, adapted, even, to, the, architecture, of, roadside, tea, houses, similarly, the, dome, on, four, arches, so, characteristic, of, sassanid, times, is, a, still, to, be, found, in, many, cemeteries, and, imamzadehs, across, iran, today, the, notion, of, earthly, towers, reaching, up, toward, the, sky, to, mingle, with, the, divine, towers, of, heaven, lasted, into, the, 19th, century, while, the, interior, court, and, pool, the, angled, entrance, and, extensive, decoration, are, ancient, but, still, common, features, of, iranian, architecture, a, circular, city, plan, was, a, characteristic, of, several, major, parthian, and, sasanian, cities, such, as, hatra, and, gor, firuzabad, another, city, design, was, based, on, a, square, geometry, found, in, the, eastern, iranian, cities, such, as, bam, and, zaranj, overall, mohammad, karim, pirnia, categorizes, the, traditional, architecture, of, the, iranian, lands, throughout, the, ages, into, the, six, following, classes, or, styles, sabk, the, pre, islamic, styles, draw, on, 3000, to, 4000, years, of, architectural, development, from, various, civilizations, of, the, iranian, plateau, the, post, islamic, architecture, of, iran, in, turn, draws, ideas, from, its, pre, islamic, predecessor, and, has, geometrical, and, repetitive, forms, as, well, as, surfaces, that, are, richly, decorated, with, glazed, tiles, carved, stucco, patterned, brickwork, floral, motifs, and, calligraphy, iran, is, recognized, by, unesco, as, being, one, of, the, cradles, of, civilization, each, of, the, periods, of, elamites, achaemenids, parthians, and, sassanids, were, creators, of, great, architecture, that, over, the, ages, spread, far, and, wide, far, to, other, cultures, although, iran, has, suffered, its, share, of, destruction, including, alexander, the, great, s, decision, to, burn, persepolis, there, are, sufficient, remains, to, form, a, picture, of, its, classical, architecture, the, achaemenids, built, on, a, grand, scale, the, artists, and, materials, they, used, were, brought, in, from, practically, all, territories, of, what, was, then, the, largest, state, in, the, world, pasargadae, set, the, standard, its, city, was, laid, out, in, an, extensive, park, with, bridges, gardens, colonnaded, palaces, and, open, column, pavilions, pasargadae, along, with, susa, and, persepolis, expressed, the, authority, of, the, king, of, kings, the, staircases, of, the, latter, recording, in, relief, sculpture, the, vast, extent, of, the, imperial, frontier, with, the, emergence, of, the, parthians, and, sassanids, new, forms, appeared, parthian, innovations, fully, flowered, during, the, sassanid, period, with, massive, barrel, vaulted, chambers, solid, masonry, domes, and, tall, columns, this, influence, was, to, remain, for, years, to, come, for, example, the, roundness, of, the, city, of, baghdad, in, the, abbasid, era, points, to, its, persian, precedents, such, as, firouzabad, in, fars, al, mansur, hired, two, designers, to, plan, the, city, s, design, naubakht, a, former, persian, zoroastrian, who, also, determined, that, the, date, of, the, foundation, of, the, city, should, be, astrologically, significant, and, mashallah, ibn, athari, a, former, jew, from, khorasan, the, ruins, of, persepolis, ctesiphon, sialk, pasargadae, firouzabad, and, arg, bam, give, us, a, distant, glimpse, of, what, contributions, persians, made, to, the, art, of, building, the, imposing, sassanid, castle, built, at, derbent, dagestan, now, a, part, of, russia, is, one, of, the, most, extant, and, living, examples, of, splendid, sassanid, iranian, architecture, since, 2003, the, sassanid, castle, has, been, listed, on, russia, s, unesco, world, heritage, list, according, to, mohammad, karim, pirnia, the, ancient, architecture, of, iran, can, be, divided, into, the, following, periods, the, pre, parsian, style, new, persian, is, a, sub, style, of, architecture, or, zeer, sabk, when, categorizing, the, history, of, persian, iranian, architectural, development, this, architectural, style, flourished, in, the, iranian, plateau, until, the, eighth, century, bc, during, the, era, of, the, median, empire, it, is, often, classified, as, a, subcategory, of, parsian, architecture, the, oldest, remains, of, the, architectural, landmarks, in, this, style, are, the, teppe, zagheh, near, qazvin, other, extant, examples, of, this, style, are, chogha, zanbil, sialk, shahr, i, sokhta, and, ecbatana, elamite, and, proto, elamite, buildings, among, others, are, covered, within, this, stylistic, subcategory, as, well, the, persian, style, new, persian, is, a, style, of, architecture, sabk, defined, by, mohammad, karim, pirnia, when, categorizing, the, history, of, persian, iranian, architectural, development, although, the, median, and, achaemenid, architecture, fall, under, this, classification, the, pre, achaemenid, architecture, is, also, studied, as, a, sub, class, of, this, category, this, style, of, architecture, flourished, from, eighth, century, bce, from, the, time, of, the, median, empire, through, the, achaemenid, empire, to, the, arrival, of, alexander, the, great, in, the, third, century, bce, this, architectural, style, includes, designs, from, the, seleucid, 310, 140, bce, parthian, 247, bce, 224, ce, and, sassanid, 224, 651, ce, eras, reaching, its, apex, of, development, in, the, sassanid, period, examples, of, this, style, are, ghal, eh, dokhtar, the, royal, compounds, at, nysa, anahita, temple, khorheh, hatra, the, ctesiphon, vault, of, kasra, bishapur, and, the, palace, of, ardashir, in, ardeshir, khwarreh, firouzabad, the, islamic, era, began, with, the, formation, of, islam, under, the, leadership, of, muhammad, in, early, 7th, century, arabia, the, arab, muslim, conquest, of, persia, began, soon, afterwards, and, ended, with, the, region, coming, under, the, control, of, the, rashidun, caliphs, followed, by, the, umayyad, caliphs, after, 661, early, islamic, architecture, was, heavily, influenced, by, byzantine, architecture, and, sasanian, architecture, umayyad, architecture, 661, 750, drew, on, elements, of, these, traditions, mixing, them, together, and, adapting, them, to, the, requirements, of, the, new, muslim, patrons, after, the, overthrow, of, the, umayyads, in, 750, and, their, replacement, by, the, abbasid, caliphate, the, caliphate, s, political, center, shifted, further, east, to, the, new, capital, of, baghdad, in, present, day, iraq, partly, as, a, result, of, this, abbasid, architecture, was, even, more, influenced, by, sasanian, architecture, and, by, its, roots, in, ancient, mesopotamia, during, the, 8th, and, 9th, centuries, the, power, and, unity, of, the, abbasid, caliphate, allowed, architectural, features, and, innovations, from, its, heartlands, to, spread, quickly, to, other, areas, of, the, islamic, world, under, its, influence, including, iran, features, from, the, umayyad, period, such, as, vaulting, carved, stucco, and, painted, wall, decoration, were, continued, and, elaborated, in, the, abbasid, period, the, four, centred, arch, a, more, sophisticated, form, of, the, pointed, arch, is, first, attested, during, the, 9th, century, in, abbasid, monuments, at, samarra, in, iraq, such, as, the, qasr, al, ashiq, palace, it, became, widely, used, in, later, iranian, architecture, samarra, also, saw, the, appearance, of, new, decorative, styles, which, rendered, the, earlier, vegetal, motifs, of, sasanian, and, byzantine, traditions, into, more, abstract, and, stylized, forms, as, exemplified, by, the, so, called, beveled, style, this, style, subsequently, spread, to, other, regions, including, iran, few, of, the, major, mosques, built, during, this, early, islamic, period, in, iran, have, survived, in, something, close, to, their, original, form, remains, of, a, mosque, at, susa, probably, from, the, abbasid, period, show, that, it, had, a, hypostyle, prayer, hall, i, e, a, hall, with, many, columns, supporting, a, roof, and, a, courtyard, another, mosque, excavated, at, siraf, dates, to, the, 9th, century, attached, to, the, mosque, was, a, minaret, tower, for, the, muezzin, to, issue, the, call, to, prayer, the, base, of, which, remains, constituting, the, oldest, remnants, of, a, minaret, in, the, eastern, islamic, world, the, jameh, mosque, of, isfahan, one, of, the, major, islamic, monuments, in, iran, was, originally, founded, towards, 771, but, it, was, rebuilt, and, expanded, in, 840, 841, it, too, had, a, courtyard, surrounded, by, hypostyle, halls, it, continued, to, undergo, further, modifications, and, additions, in, subsequent, centuries, the, only, major, mosque, from, this, early, period, to, preserve, some, of, its, original, form, is, the, tarikhaneh, mosque, in, damghan, though, the, chronology, of, its, construction, is, not, well, documented, its, overall, form, and, style, may, date, to, the, 9th, century, or, possibly, earlier, given, its, close, similarities, with, sassanid, architecture, it, has, a, courtyard, surrounded, by, a, portico, and, a, hypostyle, prayer, hall, where, the, central, aisle, leading, to, the, mihrab, a, niche, in, the, wall, symbolizing, the, qibla, is, slightly, wider, than, the, other, aisles, it, originally, had, no, minaret, but, a, tall, cylindrical, tower, was, added, to, it, in, 1026, this, minaret, is, now, the, oldest, one, still, standing, in, iran, in, secular, architecture, the, remains, of, various, palaces, and, residences, from, this, period, have, also, been, studied, such, as, those, around, merv, present, day, turkmenistan, they, shared, many, features, with, earlier, sasanian, and, sogdian, architecture, among, the, recurring, elements, are, iwans, and, domed, chambers, some, of, the, earlier, examples, up, to, the, 8th, century, seem, to, have, had, halls, with, wooden, pillars, and, roofs, while, those, that, probably, date, to, the, 9th, century, seem, to, have, favored, domes, and, vaulted, ceilings, they, also, had, stucco, decoration, executed, in, the, styles, of, samarra, residences, built, in, the, countryside, were, enclosed, by, outer, walls, with, semi, circular, towers, while, on, the, inside, they, had, central, courtyards, or, a, central, domed, hall, flanked, by, vaulted, halls, some, had, four, iwans, flanking, a, central, courtyard, the, sasanian, tradition, of, building, caravanserais, along, trade, routes, also, continued, with, the, remains, of, one, such, structure, in, southern, turkmenistan, attesting, to, the, presence, of, a, central, courtyard, surrounded, by, arcaded, galleries, with, domed, roofs, after, its, initial, apogee, of, power, the, abbasid, caliphate, fragmented, into, regional, states, in, the, 9th, and, 10th, centuries, that, were, formally, obedient, to, the, caliphs, in, baghdad, but, were, de, facto, independent, in, iran, and, central, asia, a, number, of, local, and, regional, dynasties, rose, to, power, by, the, 10th, century, iraq, and, central, iran, were, controlled, by, the, buyid, dynasty, northern, iran, was, ruled, by, the, bawandids, and, ziyarids, and, the, northeastern, regions, of, khurasan, and, transoxiana, were, ruled, by, the, samanids, with, other, dynasties, arising, in, central, asia, soon, after, it, is, around, this, period, that, many, of, the, distinctive, features, of, subsequent, iranian, and, central, asian, architecture, first, emerged, including, the, use, of, baked, brick, for, both, construction, and, decoration, the, use, of, glazed, tile, for, surface, decoration, and, the, development, of, muqarnas, three, dimensional, geometric, vaulting, from, squinches, hypostyle, mosques, continued, to, be, built, and, there, is, also, evidence, of, multi, domed, mosques, though, most, mosques, were, modified, or, rebuilt, in, later, eras, the, jameh, mosque, of, na, in, one, of, the, oldest, surviving, congregational, mosques, in, iran, contains, some, of, the, best, preserved, features, from, this, period, including, decorative, brickwork, kufic, inscriptions, and, rich, stucco, decoration, featuring, vine, scrolls, and, acanthus, leaves, that, draw, from, the, earlier, styles, of, samarra, another, important, architectural, trend, to, arise, in, the, 10th, to, 11th, centuries, is, the, development, of, mausolea, which, took, on, monumental, forms, for, the, first, time, one, type, of, mausoleum, was, the, tomb, tower, such, as, the, gunbad, i, qabus, circa, 1006, 7, while, the, other, main, type, was, the, domed, square, such, as, the, tomb, of, the, samanids, in, bukhara, before, 943, turkic, peoples, began, moving, west, across, central, asia, and, towards, the, middle, east, from, the, 8th, century, onward, eventually, converting, to, islam, and, becoming, major, forces, in, the, region, the, most, significant, of, these, were, the, seljuk, turks, who, formed, the, great, seljuk, empire, in, the, 11th, century, conquering, all, of, iran, and, other, extensive, territories, in, central, asia, and, the, middle, east, while, the, apogee, of, the, great, seljuks, was, short, lived, it, represents, a, major, benchmark, in, the, history, of, islamic, art, and, architecture, in, iran, and, central, asia, inaugurating, an, expansion, of, patronage, and, of, artistic, forms, much, of, the, seljuk, architectural, heritage, was, destroyed, during, the, mongol, invasions, in, the, 13th, century, nonetheless, compared, to, pre, seljuk, iran, a, larger, volume, of, surviving, monuments, and, artifacts, from, the, seljuk, period, has, allowed, scholars, to, study, the, arts, of, this, era, in, greater, depth, several, neighbouring, dynasties, and, empires, contemporary, with, the, seljuks, including, the, qarakhanids, the, ghaznavids, and, the, ghurids, built, monuments, in, a, very, similar, style, a, general, tradition, of, architecture, was, thus, shared, across, most, of, the, eastern, islamic, world, iran, central, asia, and, parts, of, the, northern, indian, subcontinent, throughout, the, seljuk, period, and, its, decline, from, the, 11th, to, 13th, centuries, this, period, is, also, regarded, as, a, classical, age, of, central, asian, architecture, the, most, important, religious, monument, from, the, great, seljuk, period, is, the, jameh, mosque, of, isfahan, which, was, expanded, and, modified, by, various, seljuk, patrons, in, the, late, 11th, century, and, early, 12th, century, two, major, and, innovative, domed, chambers, were, added, to, it, in, the, late, 11th, century, four, large, iwans, were, then, erected, around, the, courtyard, around, the, early, 12th, century, giving, rise, to, the, four, iwan, plan, in, mosque, architecture, the, four, iwan, plan, quickly, became, popular, and, was, applied, to, other, major, mosques, around, this, time, including, those, of, ardestan, and, zavareh, as, well, as, in, secular, architecture, it, was, probably, also, used, for, madrasas, a, new, type, of, building, introduced, around, this, time, though, none, of, the, seljuk, madrasas, have, been, well, preserved, large, caravanserais, were, built, as, a, way, to, foster, trade, and, assert, seljuk, authority, in, the, countryside, they, typically, consisted, of, a, building, with, a, fortified, exterior, appearance, monumental, entrance, portal, and, interior, courtyard, surrounded, by, various, halls, including, iwans, some, notable, examples, only, partly, preserved, are, the, caravanserais, of, ribat, i, malik, c, 1068, 1080, and, ribat, i, sharaf, 12th, century, in, transoxiana, and, khorasan, respectively, the, seljuks, also, continued, to, build, tower, tombs, an, iranian, building, type, from, earlier, periods, such, as, the, toghrul, tower, built, in, rayy, south, of, present, day, tehran, in, 1139, more, innovative, however, was, the, introduction, of, mausoleums, with, a, square, or, polygonal, floor, plan, which, later, became, a, common, form, of, monumental, tombs, early, examples, of, this, are, the, two, kharraqan, mausoleums, 1068, and, 1093, near, qazvin, northern, iran, which, have, octagonal, forms, and, the, large, mausoleum, of, sanjar, c, 1152, in, merv, present, day, turkmenistan, which, has, a, square, base, around, the, same, time, between, the, late, 10th, century, and, the, early, 13th, century, the, turkic, qarakhanids, ruled, in, transoxiana, and, executed, many, impressive, constructions, in, bukhara, and, samarkand, present, day, uzbekistan, among, the, known, qarakhanid, monuments, are, the, great, congregational, mosque, in, bukhara, of, which, only, the, kalyan, minaret, c, 1127, survives, the, nearby, minaret, of, vabkent, 1141, and, several, qarakhanid, mausoleums, with, monumental, fa, ades, such, as, those, in, uzgen, present, day, kyrgyzstan, from, the, second, half, of, the, 12th, century, further, east, the, first, major, turkic, dynasty, was, the, ghaznavids, who, became, independent, in, the, late, 10th, century, and, ruled, from, ghazna, in, present, day, afghanistan, in, the, second, half, of, the, 12th, century, the, ghurids, replaced, them, as, the, major, power, in, the, region, from, northern, india, to, the, edge, of, the, caspian, sea, among, the, most, remarkable, monuments, of, these, two, dynasties, are, a, number, of, ornate, brick, towers, and, minarets, which, have, survived, as, stand, alone, structures, their, exact, functions, are, unclear, they, include, the, tower, of, mas, ud, iii, near, ghazna, early, 12th, century, and, the, minaret, of, jam, built, by, the, ghurids, late, 12th, century, also, in, present, day, afghanistan, as, the, great, seljuks, declined, in, the, 12th, century, various, other, dynasties, often, also, of, turkic, origin, formed, smaller, states, and, empires, in, iran, and, central, asia, the, khwarazm, shahs, formerly, vassals, of, the, seljuks, and, qara, khitai, took, advantage, of, this, to, expand, their, power, and, form, the, khwarazmian, empire, occupying, much, of, the, region, and, conquering, the, ghurids, in, the, early, 13th, century, only, to, fall, soon, after, to, the, mongol, invasions, the, site, of, the, former, khwarazmian, capital, kunya, urgench, in, present, day, turkmenistan, has, preserved, several, monuments, from, the, khwarazmian, empire, period, late, 12th, and, early, 13th, century, including, the, so, called, mausoleum, of, fakhr, al, din, razi, possibly, the, tomb, of, il, arslan, and, the, mausoleum, of, sultan, tekesh, from, the, 13th, century, to, the, early, 16th, century, iran, and, central, asia, came, under, the, control, of, two, major, dynasties, descended, from, the, mongol, conqueror, genghis, khan, the, ilkhanids, 1256, 1353, and, the, timurids, 1370, 1506, this, period, saw, the, construction, of, some, of, the, largest, and, most, ambitious, iranian, monuments, of, the, islamic, world, the, ilkhanids, were, initially, traditional, nomadic, mongols, but, at, the, end, of, the, 13th, century, ghazan, khan, r, 1295, 1304, converted, to, islam, and, aided, a, cultural, and, economic, resurgence, in, which, urban, iranian, culture, was, of, primary, importance, ilkhanid, vassals, like, the, muzaffarids, and, the, jalayirids, also, sponsored, new, constructions, ilkhanid, architecture, elaborated, earlier, iranian, traditions, in, particular, greater, attention, was, given, to, interior, spaces, and, how, to, organize, them, rooms, were, made, taller, while, transverse, vaulting, was, employed, and, walls, were, opened, with, arches, thus, allowing, more, light, and, air, inside, muqarnas, which, was, previously, confined, to, covering, limited, transitional, elements, like, squinches, was, now, used, to, cover, entire, domes, and, vaults, for, purely, decorative, effect, the, tomb, of, abd, al, samad, in, natanz, 1307, 8, for, example, is, covered, inside, by, an, elaborate, muqarnas, dome, that, is, made, from, stucco, suspended, below, the, pyramidal, vault, that, roofs, the, building, brick, remained, the, main, construction, material, but, more, color, was, added, through, the, use, of, tile, mosaic, which, involved, cutting, monochrome, tiles, of, different, colors, into, pieces, that, were, then, fitted, together, to, form, larger, patterns, especially, geometric, motifs, and, floral, motifs, carved, stucco, decoration, also, continued, some, exceptional, examples, in, iran, come, from, this, period, including, a, wall, of, carved, stucco, in, the, mausoleum, of, pir, i, bakran, in, linjan, near, isfahan, and, a, mihrab, added, in, 1310, to, the, jameh, mosque, of, isfahan, the, latter, is, one, of, the, masterpieces, of, islamic, sculptural, art, from, this, era, featuring, multiple, layers, of, deeply, carved, vegetal, motifs, along, with, a, carved, inscription, various, mosques, were, built, or, expanded, during, this, period, usually, following, the, four, iwan, plan, for, congregational, mosques, e, g, at, varamin, and, kirman, except, in, the, northwest, where, cold, winters, discouraged, the, presence, of, an, open, courtyard, as, at, the, jameh, mosque, of, ardabil, now, ruined, another, hallmark, of, the, ilkhanid, period, is, the, introduction, of, monumental, mosque, portals, topped, by, twin, minarets, as, seen, at, the, jameh, mosque, of, yazd, caravanserais, were, built, again, although, the, khan, al, mirjan, in, baghdad, is, the, only, surviving, example, the, most, impressive, monument, to, survive, from, this, period, is, the, soltaniyeh, mausoleum, built, for, sultan, uljaytu, r, 1304, 1317, a, massive, dome, supported, on, a, multi, level, octagonal, structure, with, internal, and, external, galleries, only, the, domed, building, remains, today, missing, much, of, its, original, turquoise, tile, decoration, but, it, was, once, the, centerpiece, of, a, larger, religious, complex, including, a, mosque, a, hospital, and, living, areas, smaller, tombs, and, shrines, in, honour, of, local, sufis, were, also, built, or, renovated, by, ilkhanid, patrons, such, as, the, shrine, of, bayazid, bastami, in, the, town, of, bastam, the, aforementioned, mausoleum, of, pir, i, bakran, and, the, aforementioned, tomb, of, abd, al, samad, also, in, bastam, the, ilkhanids, built, a, traditional, tower, tomb, to, house, the, remains, of, uljaytu, s, infant, son, unusually, rather, than, being, an, independent, structure, the, tomb, was, erected, behind, the, qibla, wall, of, the, town, s, main, mosque, a, configuration, also, found, in, some, contemporary, mamluk, architecture, the, timurid, empire, created, by, timur, r, 1370, 1405, oversaw, another, cultural, renaissance, timurid, architecture, continued, the, tradition, of, ilkhanid, architecture, building, monuments, once, again, on, a, grand, scale, and, with, lavish, decoration, made, to, impress, but, they, also, refined, previous, designs, and, techniques, timurid, rulers, recruited, the, best, craftsmen, from, their, conquered, territories, or, even, forced, them, to, move, to, the, timurid, capital, brick, continued, to, be, used, as, construction, material, to, cover, large, brick, surfaces, with, colorful, decoration, the, banna, i, technique, was, used, to, create, geometric, patterns, and, kufic, inscriptions, at, relatively, low, cost, while, more, expensive, tile, mosaic, continued, to, be, used, for, floral, patterns, tiles, were, preferred, on, the, outside, while, interior, walls, could, be, covered, with, carved, or, painted, plaster, instead, among, the, most, important, timurid, innovations, was, the, more, sophisticated, and, fluid, arrangement, of, geometric, vaulting, large, vaults, were, divided, by, intersecting, ribs, into, smaller, vaults, which, could, then, be, further, subdivided, or, filled, with, muqarnas, and, other, types, of, decoration, muqarnas, itself, also, became, even, more, complex, by, using, smaller, individual, cells, to, create, the, larger, three, dimensional, geometric, plan, visual, balance, could, be, achieved, by, alternating, one, type, or, pattern, of, decoration, with, another, between, the, different, subdivisions, of, the, vault, by, combining, these, vaulting, techniques, with, a, cruciform, plan, and, by, breaking, the, solid, mass, of, supporting, walls, with, open, arches, and, windows, a, strict, division, between, dome, squinch, and, wall, was, dissolved, and, an, endless, diversity, of, elaborate, interior, spaces, could, be, created, the, most, significant, preserved, timurid, monuments, are, found, in, and, around, the, cities, of, khorasan, and, transoxiana, including, samarkand, bukhara, herat, and, mashhad, timur, s, own, monuments, are, distinguished, by, their, size, notably, the, bibi, khanum, mosque, and, the, gur, i, amir, mausoleum, both, in, samarkand, and, his, imposing, but, now, ruined, ak, saray, palace, at, shahr, i, sabz, the, gur, i, amir, mausoleum, and, the, bibi, khanum, mosque, are, distinguished, by, their, lavish, interior, and, exterior, decoration, their, imposing, portals, and, their, prominent, dome, the, domes, are, supported, on, tall, cylindrical, drums, and, have, a, pointed, bulging, profile, sometimes, fluted, or, ribbed, timur, s, successors, built, on, a, somewhat, smaller, scale, but, under, the, patronage, of, gawhar, shad, the, wife, of, his, son, shah, rukh, r, 1405, 1447, timurid, architecture, attained, the, height, of, sophistication, during, the, first, half, of, the, 15th, century, her, monuments, were, mainly, found, in, mashhad, and, herat, though, some, have, been, destroyed, or, severely, damaged, since, the, 19th, century, including, her, mausoleum, and, mosque, complex, 1417, 1438, some, of, the, surviving, vaulting, and, decoration, inside, her, mausoleum, is, nonetheless, indicative, of, its, original, quality, under, ulugh, beg, r, 1447, 1449, the, registan, square, in, samarkand, was, first, transformed, into, a, monumental, complex, similar, to, what, it, is, today, he, built, three, structures, around, the, square, of, which, only, the, ulugh, beg, madrasa, 1417, 1420, survives, today, two, other, monumental, structures, were, erected, around, the, square, at, later, periods, with, a, large, fa, ade, covered, by, a, rich, variety, of, decoration, timurid, patronage, was, of, high, importance, in, the, history, of, art, and, architecture, across, a, wide, part, of, the, islamic, world, the, international, timurid, style, was, eventually, integrated, into, the, visual, culture, of, the, rising, ottoman, empire, in, the, west, while, to, the, east, it, was, transmitted, to, the, indian, subcontinent, by, the, mughals, who, were, descended, from, timur, during, the, late, 14th, and, 15th, centuries, western, iran, was, dominated, by, two, powerful, turkoman, confederations, the, qara, qoyunlu, and, the, aq, qoyunlu, while, few, monuments, sponsored, by, either, faction, have, been, preserved, what, does, remain, shows, that, the, timurid, style, was, already, spreading, westward, during, this, period, one, of, the, most, significant, qara, qoyunlu, monuments, is, the, blue, mosque, or, muzaffariya, mosque, 1465, in, tabriz, now, partly, ruined, it, has, an, unusual, t, shaped, layout, around, a, central, dome, not, unlike, the, ottoman, green, mosque, in, bursa, and, is, decorated, with, a, revetment, of, very, high, quality, tilework, in, six, colours, including, a, deep, blue, the, safavids, who, forged, a, large, shi, i, empire, in, the, 16th, century, that, encompassed, all, of, iran, and, some, neighbouring, regions, initially, inherited, the, traditions, of, timurid, architecture, to, adapt, this, tradition, into, a, new, imperial, style, safavid, architects, pushed, it, to, an, even, grander, scale, safavid, architecture, simplified, timurid, architecture, to, an, extent, creating, large, architectural, ensembles, that, are, arranged, around, more, static, fixed, perspectives, that, appear, more, ceremonial, with, more, uniform, building, exteriors, and, more, streamlined, vault, designs, at, the, same, time, buildings, were, carefully, planned, and, often, given, an, open, layout, that, made, them, easy, to, enjoy, the, most, characteristic, decoration, was, tile, mosaic, applied, on, a, grand, scale, the, decorative, program, often, served, to, obscure, rather, than, highlight, the, structural, design, of, buildings, this, safavid, style, took, shape, in, isfahan, and, subsequently, spread, to, other, parts, of, the, empire, relatively, few, safavid, monuments, have, been, preserved, from, before, the, period, prior, to, the, reign, of, shah, abbas, i, r, 1588, 1629, the, most, important, exception, is, the, tomb, and, religious, complex, of, sheikh, safi, al, din, in, ardabil, this, complex, had, been, in, development, since, the, time, of, safi, al, din, d, 1334, who, founded, a, sufi, order, with, which, isma, il, i, r, 1501, 1524, the, first, safavid, ruler, associated, himself, safavid, additions, to, the, site, began, in, the, early, 16th, century, when, isma, il, s, small, domed, tomb, was, built, here, his, successor, tahmasp, i, r, 1524, 1576, carried, out, the, first, major, safavid, expansion, of, the, complex, the, most, important, structure, added, was, the, jannat, sarai, a, large, octagonal, structure, in, the, same, tradition, as, the, old, ilkhanid, mausoleum, in, soltaniyeh, perhaps, originally, intended, to, be, the, domed, tomb, of, tahmasp, i, abbas, i, also, made, further, renovations, and, additions, to, the, site, after, this, contemporary, with, the, safavids, in, iran, were, other, dynasties, and, ruling, groups, in, central, asia, such, as, the, shaybanids, and, other, uzbek, tribal, leaders, monumental, buildings, continued, to, be, built, here, drawing, on, the, traditional, timurid, style, in, bukhara, the, shaybanids, created, the, present, po, i, kalyan, complex, integrating, the, qarakhanid, era, kalan, minaret, renovating, the, old, mosque, in, 1514, and, adding, the, large, mir, i, arab, madrasa, 1535, 6, later, in, samarkand, the, local, ruler, yalangtush, bi, alchin, gave, the, registan, its, current, appearance, by, building, two, new, madrasas, across, from, ulugh, beg, s, madrasa, the, sher, dor, madrasa, 1616, 1636, imitates, the, form, of, the, ulugh, beg, madrasa, while, the, tilla, kar, madrasa, 1646, 1660, is, both, a, mosque, and, a, madrasa, architectural, activity, became, less, significant, in, the, region, after, the, 17th, century, with, the, exception, of, khiva, the, friday, mosque, of, khiva, with, its, distinctive, hypostyle, hall, of, wooden, columns, was, rebuilt, in, this, form, in, 1788, 9, abbas, i, made, isfahan, his, capital, and, embarked, on, the, most, ambitious, program, of, construction, of, the, safavid, period, as, a, result, a, very, large, proportion, of, preserved, safavid, monuments, are, concentrated, in, this, one, city, abbas, i, moved, the, political, and, economic, center, of, the, city, from, its, traditional, location, near, the, old, jameh, mosque, to, a, new, area, near, the, zayandeh, river, to, the, south, where, a, new, planned, city, was, created, it, includes, a, sprawling, grand, bazaar, lined, with, caravanserais, which, opens, via, a, monumental, portal, onto, a, vast, rectangular, public, square, the, maidan, i, shah, or, naqsh, e, jahan, laid, out, between, 1590, and, 1602, the, entire, square, is, surrounded, by, a, two, level, arcade, and, symbolizes, abbas, i, s, ambition, to, be, one, of, the, greatest, sovereigns, on, the, world, stage, in, addition, to, the, bazaar, s, portal, three, other, buildings, stand, at, the, middle, of, each, side, of, the, square, the, sheikh, lutfallah, mosque, 1603, 1619, the, shah, mosque, 1611, c, 1630, and, the, ali, qapu, a, palace, gateway, and, pavilion, begun, c, 1597, and, finished, under, abbas, ii, c, 1660, the, two, mosques, on, the, square, are, each, entered, via, monumental, portals, but, due, to, the, difference, between, the, direction, of, the, qibla, and, the, orientation, of, the, square, both, mosques, are, built, at, an, angle, from, it, and, their, vestibules, bend, on, the, way, in, both, have, prayer, halls, covered, by, a, single, large, double, shelled, dome, though, the, shah, mosque, s, prayer, hall, is, also, flanked, by, two, hypostyle, halls, unlike, in, timurid, monuments, the, dome, interiors, are, not, geometrically, subdivided, and, have, a, uniform, surface, instead, an, effect, of, lightness, is, achieved, instead, by, the, transitional, zone, of, arches, squinches, and, windows, with, the, walls, of, the, prayer, hall, in, the, shah, mosque, also, pierced, by, open, archways, on, the, outside, the, domes, have, an, onion, shape, i, e, bulging, on, the, sides, and, pointed, on, top, while, the, shah, mosque, has, minarets, and, a, traditional, central, courtyard, surrounded, by, four, iwans, the, lutfallah, mosque, has, no, minarets, and, is, different, from, all, other, safavid, mosques, by, consisting, only, of, the, single, domed, chamber, the, interiors, of, both, mosques, are, entirely, covered, in, glazed, tiles, predominantly, blue, which, were, restored, in, the, 1930s, on, the, basis, of, the, few, remaining, original, tiles, to, the, west, of, the, maidan, i, shah, square, was, a, large, palace, complex, of, gardens, and, pavilions, the, most, important, surviving, pavilion, chehel, sotoun, forty, columns, is, dated, to, 1647, by, an, inscription, but, may, have, been, established, earlier, in, 1706, 7, a, deep, broad, porch, with, columns, was, added, to, it, giving, it, its, present, appearance, the, other, notable, surviving, pavilion, hasht, behesht, mostly, dates, to, the, late, 17th, century, to, the, west, of, the, palace, grounds, is, a, long, wide, avenue, called, the, chaharbagh, four, gardens, which, ends, in, the, south, at, the, si, o, se, pol, bridge, of, thirty, three, arches, bridge, built, in, 1602, the, bridge, is, lined, with, arcades, and, features, a, wide, central, lane, for, caravans, and, beasts, of, burden, as, well, as, side, passages, for, pedestrians, further, downstream, the, khwaju, bridge, 1650, is, one, of, the, finest, monuments, of, the, reign, of, abbas, ii, like, the, si, o, se, pol, it, combines, aesthetic, effect, with, practical, function, but, it, is, more, complex, and, represents, the, apex, of, safavid, bridge, design, it, has, two, levels, each, with, a, wide, central, passage, for, caravans, and, side, passages, for, pedestrians, along, its, flanking, arches, at, the, middle, of, the, bridge, is, a, wider, viewing, pavilion, with, an, octagonal, layout, these, bridges, connect, the, city, centre, with, the, south, bank, of, the, zayandeh, river, where, royal, safavid, hunting, grounds, were, once, located, after, 1604, a, christian, armenian, quarter, new, julfa, was, also, created, here, some, 30, or, so, churches, were, built, in, the, area, of, which, 13, survive, today, dating, to, the, 17th, and, early, 18th, centuries, the, churches, imported, armenian, features, and, combined, them, with, the, contemporary, safavid, style, as, exemplified, by, the, vank, cathedral, or, holy, saviour, cathedral, dating, in, its, current, form, to, around, 1656, as, the, safavids, declined, in, the, 18th, century, the, zand, dynasty, made, shiraz, its, capital, muhammad, karim, khan, zand, the, dynasty, s, founder, created, a, grand, square, and, built, a, new, set, of, monuments, in, a, way, similar, to, the, safavid, construction, projects, in, isfahan, though, on, a, smaller, scale, among, the, surviving, monuments, of, this, project, is, the, vakil, mosque, begun, in, 1766, and, restored, in, 1827, as, well, as, a, bazaar, and, a, hammam, bathhouse, in, northern, iran, the, qajars, made, their, capital, at, tehran, they, continued, to, build, mosques, throughout, the, country, with, a, traditional, courtyard, layout, with, four, iwans, but, with, certain, variations, and, the, introduction, of, new, features, like, clocktowers, the, qajars, also, expanded, major, shrines, like, the, imam, reza, shrine, in, mashhad, and, the, fatima, masumeh, shrine, in, qom, in, shiraz, which, came, under, qajar, rule, in, 1794, the, mosque, of, nasir, al, mulk, 1876, 1888, has, a, traditional, layout, but, exemplifies, a, new, style, of, decorative, tiles, painted, in, overglaze, with, images, of, flower, bouquets, in, predominantly, blue, pink, yellow, violet, and, green, colors, sometimes, on, a, white, background, this, type, of, tile, decoration, can, also, be, seen, at, the, sepahsalar, mosque, in, tehran, 1881, 1890, of, the, qajar, palaces, built, in, and, around, tehran, the, most, famous, is, the, golestan, palace, which, was, both, the, administrative, center, and, the, shah, s, winter, residence, used, by, successive, qajar, rulers, the, palace, underwent, many, modifications, that, illustrate, the, progressive, changes, over, this, period, traditional, forms, were, still, prevalent, under, fath, ali, shah, r, 1797, 1834, who, commissioned, the, marble, throne, and, installed, it, in, a, traditional, audience, hall, fronted, by, columns, the, 19th, century, also, saw, the, rise, of, revivalist, trends, qajar, monarchs, including, fath, ali, shah, commissioned, works, that, deliberately, referenced, safavid, and, ancient, sasanian, architecture, hoping, to, appropriate, their, symbolism, of, kingship, and, empire, under, naser, al, din, shah, r, 1848, 1896, new, elements, and, styles, of, european, inspiration, began, to, be, introduced, such, as, tall, windows, pilasters, and, formal, staircases, at, the, golestan, palace, he, added, the, shams, ol, emareh, a, tall, multi, leveled, structure, with, two, towers, he, also, remodelled, tehran, demolishing, the, dense, urban, fabric, in, parts, of, the, old, city, as, well, as, its, historic, walls, and, replacing, them, with, boulevards, and, open, squares, inspired, by, what, he, saw, in, his, visits, to, europe, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, during, the, last, decades, of, qajar, rule, and, the, early, years, of, pahlavi, rule, revivalist, trends, continued, to, be, popular, and, were, employed, in, the, design, of, both, public, and, private, buildings, including, those, commissioned, by, the, rising, bourgeoisie, this, resulted, in, many, examples, of, buildings, across, the, country, with, an, eclectic, blend, of, stylistic, features, from, both, the, islamic, and, ancient, zoroastrian, eras, the, sassanid, empire, initiated, the, construction, of, the, first, large, scale, domes, in, iran, with, such, royal, buildings, as, the, palace, of, ardashir, and, dezh, dokhtar, after, the, muslim, conquest, of, the, sassanid, empire, the, persian, architectural, style, became, a, major, influence, on, islamic, societies, and, the, dome, also, became, a, feature, of, muslim, architecture, the, il, khanate, period, provided, several, innovations, to, dome, building, that, eventually, enabled, the, persians, to, construct, much, taller, structures, these, changes, later, paved, the, way, for, safavid, architecture, the, pinnacle, of, il, khanate, architecture, was, reached, with, the, construction, of, the, soltaniyeh, dome, 1302, 1312, in, zanjan, iran, which, measures, 50, m, in, height, and, 25, m, in, diameter, making, it, the, 3rd, largest, and, the, tallest, masonry, dome, ever, erected, the, thin, double, shelled, dome, was, reinforced, by, arches, between, the, layers, the, renaissance, in, persian, mosque, and, dome, building, came, during, the, safavid, dynasty, when, shah, abbas, in, 1598, initiated, the, reconstruction, of, isfahan, with, the, naqsh, e, jahan, square, as, the, centerpiece, of, his, new, capital, architecturally, they, borrowed, heavily, from, il, khanate, designs, but, artistically, they, elevated, the, designs, to, a, new, level, the, distinct, feature, of, persian, domes, which, separates, them, from, those, domes, created, in, the, christian, world, or, the, ottoman, and, mughal, empires, was, the, use, of, colourful, tiles, with, which, the, exterior, of, domes, are, covered, much, like, the, interior, these, domes, soon, numbered, dozens, in, isfahan, and, the, distinct, blue, shape, would, dominate, the, skyline, of, the, city, reflecting, the, light, of, the, sun, these, domes, appeared, like, glittering, turquoise, gems, and, could, be, seen, from, miles, away, by, travelers, following, the, silk, road, through, persia, this, very, distinct, style, of, architecture, was, inherited, from, the, seljuq, dynasty, who, for, centuries, had, used, it, in, their, mosque, building, but, it, was, perfected, during, the, safavids, when, they, invented, the, haft, rangi, or, seven, colour, style, of, tile, burning, a, process, that, enabled, them, to, apply, more, colours, to, each, tile, creating, richer, patterns, sweeter, to, the, eye, the, colours, that, the, persians, favoured, were, gold, white, and, turquoise, patterns, on, a, dark, blue, background, the, extensive, inscription, bands, of, calligraphy, and, arabesque, on, most, of, the, major, buildings, where, carefully, planned, and, executed, by, ali, reza, abbasi, who, was, appointed, head, of, the, royal, library, and, master, calligrapher, at, the, shah, s, court, in, 1598, while, shaykh, bahai, oversaw, the, construction, projects, reaching, 53, meters, in, height, the, dome, of, masjed, e, shah, shah, mosque, would, become, the, tallest, in, the, city, when, it, was, finished, in, 1629, it, was, built, as, a, double, shelled, dome, spanning, 14, m, between, the, two, layers, and, resting, on, an, octagonal, dome, chamber, contemporary, architecture, in, iran, begins, with, the, advent, of, the, first, pahlavi, period, in, the, early, 1920s, some, designers, such, as, andre, godard, created, works, such, as, the, national, museum, of, iran, that, were, reminiscent, of, iran, s, historical, architectural, heritage, others, made, an, effort, to, merge, the, traditional, elements, with, modern, designs, in, their, works, the, tehran, university, main, campus, is, one, such, example, others, such, as, heydar, ghiai, and, houshang, seyhoun, have, tried, to, create, completely, original, works, independent, of, prior, influences, dariush, borbor, s, architecture, successfully, combined, modern, architecture, with, local, vernacular, the, azadi, tower, originally, called, the, shadyad, tower, was, completed, in, 1971, and, has, since, become, one, of, the, major, landmarks, of, tehran, designed, by, hossein, amanat, it, incorporates, forms, and, ideas, from, historic, iranian, architecture, borj, e, milad, or, milad, tower, completed, in, 2007, is, the, tallest, tower, in, iran, and, is, the, sixth, tallest, tower, in, the, world, the, first, professional,
