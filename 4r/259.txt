leviathan, or, the, matter, forme, and, power, of, a, commonwealth, ecclesiasticall, and, civil, commonly, referred, to, as, leviathan, is, a, book, written, by, thomas, hobbes, 1588, 1679, and, published, in, 1651, revised, latin, edition, 1668, its, name, derives, from, the, biblical, leviathan, the, work, concerns, the, structure, of, society, and, legitimate, government, and, is, regarded, as, one, of, the, earliest, and, most, influential, examples, of, social, contract, theory, written, during, the, english, civil, war, 1642, 1651, it, argues, for, a, social, contract, and, rule, by, an, absolute, sovereign, hobbes, wrote, that, civil, war, and, the, brute, situation, of, a, state, of, nature, the, war, of, all, against, all, could, be, avoided, only, by, a, strong, undivided, government, the, title, of, hobbes, s, treatise, alludes, to, the, leviathan, mentioned, in, the, book, of, job, in, contrast, to, the, simply, informative, titles, usually, given, to, works, of, early, modern, political, philosophy, such, as, john, locke, s, two, treatises, of, government, or, hobbes, s, own, earlier, work, the, elements, of, law, hobbes, selected, a, poetic, name, for, this, more, provocative, treatise, lexicographers, in, the, early, modern, period, supposed, that, the, term, leviathan, was, associated, with, the, hebrew, words, lavah, meaning, to, couple, connect, or, join, and, thannin, believed, to, mean, a, serpent, or, dragon, in, the, westminster, assembly, s, annotations, on, the, bible, the, interpreters, thought, that, the, creature, was, named, using, these, root, words, because, by, his, bignesse, he, seemes, not, one, single, creature, but, a, coupling, of, divers, together, or, because, his, scales, are, closed, or, straitly, compacted, together, samuel, mintz, suggests, that, these, connotations, lend, themselves, to, hobbes, s, understanding, of, political, force, since, both, leviathan, and, hobbes, s, sovereign, are, unities, compacted, out, of, separate, individuals, they, are, omnipotent, they, cannot, be, destroyed, or, divided, they, inspire, fear, in, men, they, do, not, make, pacts, with, men, theirs, is, the, dominion, of, power, on, pain, of, death, after, lengthy, discussion, with, thomas, hobbes, the, parisian, abraham, bosse, created, the, etching, for, the, book, s, famous, frontispiece, in, the, g, ometrique, style, which, bosse, himself, had, refined, it, is, similar, in, organisation, to, the, frontispiece, of, hobbes, de, cive, 1642, created, by, jean, matheus, the, frontispiece, has, two, main, elements, in, it, a, giant, crowned, figure, is, seen, emerging, from, the, landscape, clutching, a, sword, and, a, crosier, beneath, a, quote, from, the, book, of, job, non, est, potestas, super, terram, quae, comparetur, ei, iob, 41, 24, there, is, no, power, on, earth, to, be, compared, to, him, job, 41, 24, further, linking, the, figure, to, the, monster, of, the, book, due, to, disagreements, over, the, precise, location, of, the, chapters, and, verses, when, they, were, divided, in, the, late, middle, ages, the, verse, hobbes, quotes, is, usually, given, as, job, 41, 33, in, modern, christian, translations, into, english, job, 41, 25, in, the, masoretic, text, septuagint, and, the, luther, bible, it, is, job, 41, 24, in, the, vulgate, the, torso, and, arms, of, the, figure, are, composed, of, over, three, hundred, persons, in, the, style, of, giuseppe, arcimboldo, all, are, facing, away, from, the, viewer, with, just, the, giant, s, head, having, visible, facial, features, a, manuscript, of, leviathan, created, for, charles, ii, in, 1651, has, notable, differences, a, different, main, head, but, significantly, the, body, is, also, composed, of, many, faces, all, looking, outwards, from, the, body, and, with, a, range, of, expressions, the, lower, portion, is, a, triptych, framed, in, a, wooden, border, the, centre, form, contains, the, title, on, an, ornate, curtain, the, two, sides, reflect, the, sword, and, crosier, of, the, main, figure, earthly, power, on, the, left, and, the, powers, of, the, church, on, the, right, each, side, element, reflects, the, equivalent, power, castle, to, church, crown, to, mitre, cannon, to, excommunication, weapons, to, logic, and, the, battlefield, to, the, religious, courts, the, giant, holds, the, symbols, of, both, sides, reflecting, the, union, of, secular, and, spiritual, in, the, sovereign, but, the, construction, of, the, torso, also, makes, the, figure, the, state, hobbes, begins, his, treatise, on, politics, with, an, account, of, human, nature, he, presents, an, image, of, man, as, matter, in, motion, attempting, to, show, through, example, how, everything, about, humanity, can, be, explained, materialistically, that, is, without, recourse, to, an, incorporeal, immaterial, soul, or, a, faculty, for, understanding, ideas, that, are, external, to, the, human, mind, life, is, but, a, motion, of, limbs, for, what, is, the, heart, but, a, spring, and, the, nerves, but, so, many, strings, and, the, joints, but, so, many, wheels, giving, motion, to, the, whole, body, such, as, was, intended, by, the, artificer, hobbes, proceeds, by, defining, terms, clearly, and, unsentimentally, good, and, evil, are, nothing, more, than, terms, used, to, denote, an, individual, s, appetites, and, desires, while, these, appetites, and, desires, are, nothing, more, than, the, tendency, to, move, toward, or, away, from, an, object, hope, is, nothing, more, than, an, appetite, for, a, thing, combined, with, an, opinion, that, it, can, be, had, he, suggests, that, the, dominant, political, theology, of, the, time, scholasticism, thrives, on, confused, definitions, of, everyday, words, such, as, incorporeal, substance, which, for, hobbes, is, a, contradiction, in, terms, hobbes, describes, human, psychology, without, any, reference, to, the, summum, bonum, or, greatest, good, as, previous, thought, had, done, according, to, hobbes, not, only, is, the, concept, of, a, summum, bonum, superfluous, but, given, the, variability, of, human, desires, there, could, be, no, such, thing, consequently, any, political, community, that, sought, to, provide, the, greatest, good, to, its, members, would, find, itself, driven, by, competing, conceptions, of, that, good, with, no, way, to, decide, among, them, the, result, would, be, civil, war, however, hobbes, states, that, there, is, a, summum, malum, or, greatest, evil, this, is, the, fear, of, violent, death, a, political, community, can, be, oriented, around, this, fear, since, there, is, no, summum, bonum, the, natural, state, of, man, is, not, to, be, found, in, a, political, community, that, pursues, the, greatest, good, but, to, be, outside, of, a, political, community, is, to, be, in, an, anarchic, condition, given, human, nature, the, variability, of, human, desires, and, need, for, scarce, resources, to, fulfill, those, desires, the, state, of, nature, as, hobbes, calls, this, anarchic, condition, must, be, a, war, of, all, against, all, even, when, two, men, are, not, fighting, there, is, no, guarantee, that, the, other, will, not, try, to, kill, him, for, his, property, or, just, out, of, an, aggrieved, sense, of, honour, and, so, they, must, constantly, be, on, guard, against, one, another, it, is, even, reasonable, to, preemptively, attack, one, s, neighbour, in, such, condition, there, is, no, place, for, industry, because, the, fruit, thereof, is, uncertain, and, consequently, no, culture, of, the, earth, no, navigation, nor, the, use, of, commodities, that, may, be, imported, by, sea, no, commodious, building, no, instruments, of, moving, and, removing, such, things, as, require, much, force, no, knowledge, of, the, face, of, the, earth, no, account, of, time, no, arts, no, letters, no, society, and, which, is, worst, of, all, continual, fear, and, danger, of, violent, death, and, the, life, of, man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and, short, the, desire, to, avoid, the, state, of, nature, as, the, place, where, the, summum, malum, of, violent, death, is, most, likely, to, occur, forms, the, polestar, of, political, reasoning, it, suggests, a, number, of, laws, of, nature, although, hobbes, is, quick, to, point, out, that, they, cannot, properly, speaking, be, called, laws, since, there, is, no, one, to, enforce, them, the, first, thing, that, reason, suggests, is, to, seek, peace, but, that, where, peace, cannot, be, had, to, use, all, of, the, advantages, of, war, hobbes, is, explicit, that, in, the, state, of, nature, nothing, can, be, considered, just, or, unjust, and, every, man, must, be, considered, to, have, a, right, to, all, things, the, second, law, of, nature, is, that, one, ought, to, be, willing, to, renounce, one, s, right, to, all, things, where, others, are, willing, to, do, the, same, to, quit, the, state, of, nature, and, to, erect, a, commonwealth, with, the, authority, to, command, them, in, all, things, hobbes, concludes, part, one, by, articulating, an, additional, seventeen, laws, of, nature, that, make, the, performance, of, the, first, two, possible, and, by, explaining, what, it, would, mean, for, a, sovereign, to, represent, the, people, even, when, they, disagree, with, the, sovereign, the, purpose, of, a, commonwealth, is, given, at, the, start, of, part, ii, the, final, cause, end, or, design, of, men, who, naturally, love, liberty, and, dominion, over, others, in, the, introduction, of, that, restraint, upon, themselves, in, which, we, see, them, live, in, commonwealths, is, the, foresight, of, their, own, preservation, and, of, a, more, contented, life, thereby, that, is, to, say, of, getting, themselves, out, from, that, miserable, condition, of, war, which, is, necessarily, consequent, as, hath, been, shown, to, the, natural, passions, of, men, when, there, is, no, visible, power, to, keep, them, in, awe, and, tie, them, by, fear, of, punishment, to, the, performance, of, their, covenants, the, commonwealth, is, instituted, when, all, agree, in, the, following, manner, i, authorise, and, give, up, my, right, of, governing, myself, to, this, man, or, to, this, assembly, of, men, on, this, condition, that, thou, give, up, thy, right, to, him, and, authorise, all, his, actions, in, like, manner, the, sovereign, has, twelve, principal, rights, hobbes, explicitly, rejects, the, idea, of, separation, of, powers, in, item, 6, hobbes, is, explicitly, in, favour, of, censorship, of, the, press, and, restrictions, on, the, rights, of, free, speech, should, they, be, considered, desirable, by, the, sovereign, to, promote, order, philosophers, works, there, are, three, monarchy, aristocracy, and, democracy, the, difference, of, commonwealths, consisted, in, the, difference, of, the, sovereign, or, the, person, representative, of, all, and, every, one, of, the, multitude, and, because, the, sovereignty, is, either, in, one, man, or, in, an, assembly, of, more, than, one, and, into, that, assembly, either, every, man, hath, right, to, enter, or, not, every, one, but, certain, men, distinguished, from, the, rest, it, is, manifest, there, can, be, but, three, kinds, of, commonwealth, for, the, representative, must, needs, be, one, man, or, more, and, if, more, then, it, is, the, assembly, of, all, or, but, of, a, part, when, the, representative, is, one, man, then, is, the, commonwealth, a, monarchy, when, an, assembly, of, all, that, will, come, together, then, it, is, a, democracy, or, popular, commonwealth, when, an, assembly, of, a, part, only, then, it, is, called, an, aristocracy, and, only, three, since, unlike, aristotle, he, does, not, sub, divide, them, into, good, and, deviant, other, kind, of, commonwealth, there, can, be, none, for, either, one, or, more, or, all, must, have, the, sovereign, power, which, i, have, shown, to, be, indivisible, entire, there, be, other, names, of, government, in, the, histories, and, books, of, policy, as, tyranny, and, oligarchy, but, they, are, not, the, names, of, other, forms, of, government, but, of, the, same, forms, misliked, for, they, that, are, discontented, under, monarchy, call, it, tyranny, and, they, that, are, displeased, with, aristocracy, call, it, oligarchy, so, also, they, which, find, themselves, grieved, under, a, democracy, call, it, anarchy, which, signifies, want, of, government, and, yet, i, think, no, man, believes, that, want, of, government, is, any, new, kind, of, government, nor, by, the, same, reason, ought, they, to, believe, that, the, government, is, of, one, kind, when, they, like, it, and, another, when, they, mislike, it, or, are, oppressed, by, the, governors, and, monarchy, is, the, best, on, practical, grounds, the, difference, between, these, three, kinds, of, commonwealth, consisteth, not, in, the, difference, of, power, but, in, the, difference, of, convenience, or, aptitude, to, produce, the, peace, and, security, of, the, people, for, which, end, they, were, instituted, and, to, compare, monarchy, with, the, other, two, we, may, observe, first, that, whosoever, beareth, the, person, of, the, people, or, is, one, of, that, assembly, that, bears, it, beareth, also, his, own, natural, person, and, though, he, be, careful, in, his, politic, person, to, procure, the, common, interest, yet, he, is, more, or, no, less, careful, to, procure, the, private, good, of, himself, his, family, kindred, and, friends, and, for, the, most, part, if, the, public, interest, chance, to, cross, the, private, he, prefers, the, private, for, the, passions, of, men, are, commonly, more, potent, than, their, reason, from, whence, it, follows, that, where, the, public, and, private, interest, are, most, closely, united, there, is, the, public, most, advanced, now, in, monarchy, the, private, interest, is, the, same, with, the, public, the, riches, power, and, honour, of, a, monarch, arise, only, from, the, riches, strength, and, reputation, of, his, subjects, for, no, king, can, be, rich, nor, glorious, nor, secure, whose, subjects, are, either, poor, or, contemptible, or, too, weak, through, want, or, dissension, to, maintain, a, war, against, their, enemies, whereas, in, a, democracy, or, aristocracy, the, public, prosperity, confers, not, so, much, to, the, private, fortune, of, one, that, is, corrupt, or, ambitious, as, doth, many, times, a, perfidious, advice, a, treacherous, action, or, a, civil, war, the, right, of, succession, always, lies, with, the, sovereign, democracies, and, aristocracies, have, easy, succession, monarchy, is, harder, the, greatest, difficulty, about, the, right, of, succession, is, in, monarchy, and, the, difficulty, ariseth, from, this, that, at, first, sight, it, is, not, manifest, who, is, to, appoint, the, successor, nor, many, times, who, it, is, whom, he, hath, appointed, for, in, both, these, cases, there, is, required, a, more, exact, ratiocination, than, every, man, is, accustomed, to, use, because, in, general, people, haven, t, thought, carefully, however, the, succession, is, definitely, in, the, gift, of, the, monarch, as, to, the, question, who, shall, appoint, the, successor, of, a, monarch, that, hath, the, sovereign, authority, we, are, to, consider, that, either, he, that, is, in, possession, has, right, to, dispose, of, the, succession, or, else, that, right, is, again, in, the, dissolved, multitude, therefore, it, is, manifest, that, by, the, institution, of, monarchy, the, disposing, of, the, successor, is, always, left, to, the, judgement, and, will, of, the, present, possessor, but, it, is, not, always, obvious, who, the, monarch, has, appointed, and, for, the, question, which, may, arise, sometimes, who, it, is, that, the, monarch, in, possession, hath, designed, to, the, succession, and, inheritance, of, his, power, however, the, answer, is, it, is, determined, by, his, express, words, and, testament, or, by, other, tacit, signs, sufficient, and, this, means, by, express, words, or, testament, when, it, is, declared, by, him, in, his, lifetime, viva, voce, or, by, writing, as, the, first, emperors, of, rome, declared, who, should, be, their, heirs, note, that, perhaps, rather, radically, this, does, not, have, to, be, any, blood, relative, for, the, word, heir, does, not, of, itself, imply, the, children, or, nearest, kindred, of, a, man, but, whomsoever, a, man, shall, any, way, declare, he, would, have, to, succeed, him, in, his, estate, if, therefore, a, monarch, declare, expressly, that, such, a, man, shall, be, his, heir, either, by, word, or, writing, then, is, that, man, immediately, after, the, decease, of, his, predecessor, invested, in, the, right, of, being, monarch, however, practically, this, means, but, where, testament, and, express, words, are, wanting, other, natural, signs, of, the, will, are, to, be, followed, whereof, the, one, is, custom, and, therefore, where, the, custom, is, that, the, next, of, kindred, absolutely, succeedeth, there, also, the, next, of, kindred, hath, right, to, the, succession, for, that, if, the, will, of, him, that, was, in, possession, had, been, otherwise, he, might, easily, have, declared, the, same, in, his, lifetime, in, leviathan, hobbes, explicitly, states, that, the, sovereign, has, authority, to, assert, power, over, matters, of, faith, and, doctrine, and, that, if, he, does, not, do, so, he, invites, discord, hobbes, presents, his, own, religious, theory, but, states, that, he, would, defer, to, the, will, of, the, sovereign, when, that, was, re, established, again, leviathan, was, written, during, the, civil, war, as, to, whether, his, theory, was, acceptable, hobbes, materialistic, presuppositions, also, led, him, to, hold, a, view, which, was, considered, highly, controversial, at, the, time, hobbes, rejected, the, idea, of, incorporeal, substances, and, subsequently, argued, that, even, god, himself, was, a, corporeal, substance, although, hobbes, never, explicitly, stated, he, was, an, atheist, many, allude, to, the, possibility, that, he, was, hobbes, also, touched, upon, the, sovereign, s, ability, to, tax, in, leviathan, although, he, is, not, as, widely, cited, for, his, economic, theories, as, he, is, for, his, political, theories, hobbes, believed, that, equal, justice, includes, the, equal, imposition, of, taxes, the, equality, of, taxes, doesn, t, depend, on, equality, of, wealth, but, on, the, equality, of, the, debt, that, every, man, owes, to, the, commonwealth, for, his, defence, and, the, maintenance, of, the, rule, of, law, hobbes, also, championed, public, support, for, those, unable, to, maintain, themselves, by, labour, which, would, presumably, be, funded, by, taxation, he, advocated, public, encouragement, of, works, of, navigation, etc, to, usefully, employ, the, poor, who, could, work, in, part, iii, hobbes, seeks, to, investigate, the, nature, of, a, christian, commonwealth, this, immediately, raises, the, question, of, which, scriptures, we, should, trust, and, why, if, any, person, may, claim, supernatural, revelation, superior, to, the, civil, law, then, there, would, be, chaos, and, hobbes, fervent, desire, is, to, avoid, this, hobbes, thus, begins, by, establishing, that, we, cannot, infallibly, know, another, s, personal, word, to, be, divine, revelation, when, god, speaketh, to, man, it, must, be, either, immediately, or, by, mediation, of, another, man, to, whom, he, had, formerly, spoken, by, himself, immediately, how, god, speaketh, to, a, man, immediately, may, be, understood, by, those, well, enough, to, whom, he, hath, so, spoken, but, how, the, same, should, be, understood, by, another, is, hard, if, not, impossible, to, know, for, if, a, man, pretend, to, me, that, god, hath, spoken, to, him, supernaturally, and, immediately, and, i, make, doubt, of, it, i, cannot, easily, perceive, what, argument, he, can, produce, to, oblige, me, to, believe, it, this, is, good, but, if, applied, too, fervently, would, lead, to, all, the, bible, being, rejected, so, hobbes, says, we, need, a, test, and, the, true, test, is, established, by, examining, the, books, of, scripture, and, is, so, that, it, is, manifest, that, the, teaching, of, the, religion, which, god, hath, established, and, the, showing, of, a, present, miracle, joined, together, were, the, only, marks, whereby, the, scripture, would, have, a, true, prophet, that, is, to, say, immediate, revelation, to, be, acknowledged, of, them, being, singly, sufficient, to, oblige, any, other, man, to, regard, what, he, saith, seeing, therefore, miracles, now, cease, we, have, no, sign, left, whereby, to, acknowledge, the, pretended, revelations, or, inspirations, of, any, private, man, nor, obligation, to, give, ear, to, any, doctrine, farther, than, it, is, conformable, to, the, holy, scriptures, which, since, the, time, of, our, saviour, supply, the, place, and, sufficiently, recompense, the, want, of, all, other, prophecy, seeing, therefore, miracles, now, cease, means, that, only, the, books, of, the, bible, can, be, trusted, hobbes, then, discusses, the, various, books, which, are, accepted, by, various, sects, and, the, question, much, disputed, between, the, diverse, sects, of, christian, religion, from, whence, the, scriptures, derive, their, authority, to, hobbes, it, is, manifest, that, none, can, know, they, are, god, s, word, though, all, true, christians, believe, it, but, those, to, whom, god, himself, hath, revealed, it, supernaturally, and, therefore, the, question, truly, stated, is, by, what, authority, they, are, made, law, unsurprisingly, hobbes, concludes, that, ultimately, there, is, no, way, to, determine, this, other, than, the, civil, power, he, therefore, to, whom, god, hath, not, supernaturally, revealed, that, they, are, his, nor, that, those, that, published, them, were, sent, by, him, is, not, obliged, to, obey, them, by, any, authority, but, his, whose, commands, have, already, the, force, of, laws, that, is, to, say, by, any, other, authority, than, that, of, the, commonwealth, residing, in, the, sovereign, who, only, has, the, legislative, power, he, discusses, the, ten, commandments, and, asks, who, it, was, that, gave, to, these, written, tables, the, obligatory, force, of, laws, there, is, no, doubt, but, they, were, made, laws, by, god, himself, but, because, a, law, obliges, not, nor, is, law, to, any, but, to, them, that, acknowledge, it, to, be, the, act, of, the, sovereign, how, could, the, people, of, israel, that, were, forbidden, to, approach, the, mountain, to, hear, what, god, said, to, moses, be, obliged, to, obedience, to, all, those, laws, which, moses, propounded, to, them, and, concludes, as, before, that, making, of, the, scripture, law, belonged, to, the, civil, sovereign, finally, we, are, to, consider, now, what, office, in, the, church, those, persons, have, who, being, civil, sovereigns, have, embraced, also, the, christian, faith, to, which, the, answer, is, christian, kings, are, still, the, supreme, pastors, of, their, people, and, have, power, to, ordain, what, pastors, they, please, to, teach, the, church, that, is, to, teach, the, people, committed, to, their, charge, there, is, an, enormous, amount, of, biblical, scholarship, in, this, third, part, however, once, hobbes, initial, argument, is, accepted, that, no, one, can, know, for, sure, anyone, else, s, divine, revelation, his, conclusion, the, religious, power, is, subordinate, to, the, civil, follows, from, his, logic, the, very, extensive, discussions, of, the, chapter, were, probably, necessary, for, its, time, the, need, as, hobbes, saw, it, for, the, civil, sovereign, to, be, supreme, arose, partly, from, the, many, sects, that, arose, around, the, civil, war, and, to, quash, the, pope, of, rome, s, challenge, to, which, hobbes, devotes, an, extensive, section, hobbes, named, part, iv, of, his, book, kingdom, of, darkness, by, this, hobbes, does, not, mean, hell, he, did, not, believe, in, hell, or, purgatory, but, the, darkness, of, ignorance, as, opposed, to, the, light, of, true, knowledge, hobbes, interpretation, is, largely, unorthodox, and, so, sees, much, darkness, in, what, he, sees, as, the, misinterpretation, of, scripture, hobbes, enumerates, four, causes, of, this, darkness, the, first, is, by, extinguishing, the, light, of, scripture, through, misinterpretation, hobbes, sees, the, main, abuse, as, teaching, that, the, kingdom, of, god, can, be, found, in, the, church, thus, undermining, the, authority, of, the, civil, sovereign, another, general, abuse, of, scripture, in, his, view, is, the, turning, of, consecration, into, conjuration, or, silly, ritual, the, second, cause, is, the, demonology, of, the, heathen, poets, in, hobbes, s, opinion, demons, are, nothing, more, than, constructs, of, the, brain, hobbes, then, goes, on, to,
