husband, gregor, is, the, main, character, of, the, story, he, works, as, a, traveling, salesman, in, order, to, provide, money, for, his, sister, and, parents, he, wakes, up, one, morning, finding, himself, transformed, into, an, insect, after, the, metamorphosis, gregor, becomes, unable, to, work, and, is, confined, to, his, room, for, most, of, the, remainder, of, the, story, this, prompts, his, family, to, begin, working, once, again, gregor, is, depicted, as, isolated, from, society, and, often, both, misunderstands, the, true, intentions, of, others, and, is, misunderstood, grete, is, gregor, s, younger, sister, and, she, becomes, his, caretaker, after, his, metamorphosis, they, initially, have, a, close, relationship, but, this, quickly, fades, at, first, she, volunteers, to, feed, him, and, clean, his, room, but, she, grows, increasingly, impatient, with, the, burden, and, begins, to, leave, his, room, in, disarray, out, of, spite, her, initial, decision, to, take, care, of, gregor, may, have, come, from, a, desire, to, contribute, and, be, useful, to, the, family, since, she, becomes, angry, and, upset, when, the, mother, cleans, his, room, it, is, made, clear, that, grete, is, disgusted, by, gregor, as, she, always, opens, the, window, upon, entering, his, room, to, keep, from, feeling, nauseous, and, leaves, without, doing, anything, if, gregor, is, in, plain, sight, she, plays, the, violin, and, dreams, of, going, to, the, conservatory, to, study, a, dream, gregor, had, intended, to, make, happen, he, had, planned, on, making, the, announcement, on, christmas, day, to, help, provide, an, income, for, the, family, after, gregor, s, transformation, she, starts, working, as, a, salesgirl, grete, is, also, the, first, to, suggest, getting, rid, of, gregor, which, causes, gregor, to, plan, his, own, death, at, the, end, of, the, story, grete, s, parents, realize, that, she, has, become, beautiful, and, full, figured, and, decide, to, consider, finding, her, a, husband, mr, samsa, is, gregor, s, father, after, the, metamorphosis, he, is, forced, to, return, to, work, in, order, to, support, the, family, financially, his, attitude, towards, his, son, is, harsh, he, regards, the, transformed, gregor, with, disgust, and, possibly, even, fear, and, attacks, gregor, on, several, occasions, even, when, gregor, was, human, mr, samsa, regarded, him, mostly, as, a, source, of, income, for, the, family, gregor, s, relationship, with, his, father, is, modelled, after, kafka, s, own, relationship, with, his, father, the, theme, of, alienation, becomes, quite, evident, here, mrs, samsa, is, gregor, s, mother, she, is, portrayed, as, a, submissive, wife, she, suffers, from, asthma, which, is, a, constant, source, of, concern, for, gregor, she, is, initially, shocked, at, gregor, s, transformation, but, she, still, wants, to, enter, his, room, however, it, proves, too, much, for, her, and, gives, rise, to, a, conflict, between, her, maternal, impulse, and, sympathy, and, her, fear, and, revulsion, at, gregor, s, new, form, the, charwoman, is, an, old, widowed, lady, who, is, employed, by, the, samsa, family, after, their, previous, maid, begs, to, be, dismissed, on, account, of, the, fright, she, experiences, owing, to, gregor, s, new, form, she, is, paid, to, take, care, of, their, household, duties, apart, from, grete, and, her, father, the, charwoman, is, the, only, person, who, is, in, close, contact, with, gregor, and, she, is, unafraid, in, her, dealings, with, gregor, she, does, not, question, his, changed, state, she, seemingly, accepts, it, as, a, normal, part, of, his, existence, she, is, the, one, who, notices, gregor, has, died, and, disposes, of, his, body, like, much, of, kafka, s, work, the, metamorphosis, tends, to, be, given, a, religious, max, brod, or, psychological, interpretation, it, has, been, particularly, common, to, read, the, story, as, an, expression, of, kafka, s, father, complex, as, was, first, done, by, charles, neider, in, his, the, frozen, sea, a, study, of, franz, kafka, 1948, besides, the, psychological, approach, interpretations, focusing, on, sociological, aspects, which, see, the, samsa, family, as, a, portrayal, of, general, social, circumstances, have, also, gained, a, large, following, vladimir, nabokov, rejected, such, interpretations, noting, that, they, do, not, live, up, to, kafka, s, art, he, instead, chose, an, interpretation, guided, by, the, artistic, detail, but, excluded, any, symbolic, or, allegoric, meanings, arguing, against, the, popular, father, complex, theory, he, observed, that, it, is, the, sister, more, than, the, father, who, should, be, considered, the, cruelest, person, in, the, story, since, she, is, the, one, backstabbing, gregor, in, nabokov, s, view, the, central, narrative, theme, is, the, artist, s, struggle, for, existence, in, a, society, replete, with, philistines, who, destroy, him, step, by, step, commenting, on, kafka, s, style, he, writes, the, transparency, of, his, style, underlines, the, dark, richness, of, his, fantasy, world, contrast, and, uniformity, style, and, the, depicted, portrayal, and, fable, are, seamlessly, intertwined, in, 1989, nina, pelikan, straus, wrote, a, feminist, interpretation, of, the, metamorphosis, noting, that, the, story, is, not, only, about, the, metamorphosis, of, gregor, but, also, about, the, metamorphosis, of, his, family, and, in, particular, his, younger, sister, grete, straus, suggested, that, the, social, and, psychoanalytic, resonances, of, the, text, depend, on, grete, s, role, as, a, woman, daughter, and, sister, and, that, prior, interpretations, failed, to, recognize, grete, s, centrality, to, the, story, in, 1999, gerhard, rieck, pointed, out, that, gregor, and, his, sister, grete, form, a, pair, which, is, typical, of, many, of, kafka, s, texts, it, is, made, up, of, one, passive, rather, austere, person, and, another, active, more, libidinal, person, the, appearance, of, figures, with, such, almost, irreconcilable, personalities, who, form, couples, in, kafka, s, works, has, been, evident, since, he, wrote, his, short, story, description, of, a, struggle, e, g, the, narrator, young, man, and, his, acquaintance, they, also, appear, in, the, judgment, georg, and, his, friend, in, russia, in, all, three, of, his, novels, e, g, robinson, and, delamarche, in, amerika, as, well, as, in, his, short, stories, a, country, doctor, the, country, doctor, and, the, groom, and, a, hunger, artist, the, hunger, artist, and, the, panther, rieck, views, these, pairs, as, parts, of, one, single, person, hence, the, similarity, between, the, names, gregor, and, grete, and, in, the, final, analysis, as, the, two, determining, components, of, the, author, s, personality, not, only, in, kafka, s, life, but, also, in, his, oeuvre, does, rieck, see, the, description, of, a, fight, between, these, two, parts, reiner, stach, argued, in, 2004, that, no, elucidating, comments, were, needed, to, illustrate, the, story, and, that, it, was, convincing, by, itself, self, contained, even, absolute, he, believes, that, there, is, no, doubt, the, story, would, have, been, admitted, to, the, canon, of, world, literature, even, if, we, had, known, nothing, about, its, author, according, to, peter, andr, alt, 2005, the, figure, of, the, insect, becomes, a, drastic, expression, of, gregor, samsa, s, deprived, existence, reduced, to, carrying, out, his, professional, responsibilities, anxious, to, guarantee, his, advancement, and, vexed, with, the, fear, of, making, commercial, mistakes, he, is, the, creature, of, a, functionalistic, professional, life, in, 2007, ralf, sudau, took, the, view, that, particular, attention, should, be, paid, to, the, motifs, of, self, abnegation, and, disregard, for, reality, gregor, s, earlier, behavior, was, characterized, by, self, renunciation, and, his, pride, in, being, able, to, provide, a, secure, and, leisured, existence, for, his, family, when, he, finds, himself, in, a, situation, where, he, himself, is, in, need, of, attention, and, assistance, and, in, danger, of, becoming, a, parasite, he, doesn, t, want, to, admit, this, new, role, to, himself, and, be, disappointed, by, the, treatment, he, receives, from, his, family, which, is, becoming, more, and, more, careless, and, even, hostile, over, time, according, to, sudau, gregor, is, self, denyingly, hiding, his, nauseating, appearance, under, the, sofa, and, gradually, famishing, thus, pretty, much, complying, with, the, more, or, less, blatant, wish, of, his, family, his, gradual, emaciation, and, self, reduction, shows, signs, of, a, fatal, hunger, strike, which, on, the, part, of, gregor, is, unconscious, and, unsuccessful, on, the, part, of, his, family, not, understood, or, ignored, sudau, also, lists, the, names, of, selected, interpreters, of, the, metamorphosis, e, g, beicken, sokel, sautermeister, and, schwarz, according, to, them, the, narrative, is, a, metaphor, for, the, suffering, resulting, from, leprosy, an, escape, into, the, disease, or, a, symptom, onset, an, image, of, an, existence, which, is, defaced, by, the, career, or, a, revealing, staging, which, cracks, the, veneer, and, superficiality, of, everyday, circumstances, and, exposes, its, cruel, essence, he, further, notes, that, kafka, s, representational, style, is, on, one, hand, characterized, by, an, idiosyncratic, interpenetration, of, realism, and, fantasy, a, worldly, mind, rationality, and, clarity, of, observation, and, on, the, other, hand, by, folly, outlandishness, and, fallacy, he, also, points, to, the, grotesque, and, tragicomical, silent, film, like, elements, fernando, bermejo, rubio, 2012, argued, that, the, story, is, often, viewed, unjustly, as, inconclusive, he, derives, his, interpretative, approach, from, the, fact, that, the, descriptions, of, gregor, and, his, family, environment, in, the, metamorphosis, contradict, each, other, diametrically, opposed, versions, exist, of, gregor, s, back, his, voice, of, whether, he, is, ill, or, already, undergoing, the, metamorphosis, whether, he, is, dreaming, or, not, which, treatment, he, deserves, of, his, moral, point, of, view, false, accusations, made, by, grete, and, whether, his, family, is, blameless, or, not, bermejo, rubio, emphasizes, that, kafka, ordered, in, 1915, that, there, should, be, no, illustration, of, gregor, he, argues, that, it, is, exactly, this, absence, of, a, visual, narrator, that, is, essential, for, kafka, s, project, for, he, who, depicts, gregor, would, stylize, himself, as, an, omniscient, narrator, another, reason, why, kafka, opposed, such, an, illustration, is, that, the, reader, should, not, be, biased, in, any, way, before, reading, that, the, descriptions, are, not, compatible, with, each, other, is, indicative, of, the, fact, that, the, opening, statement, is, not, to, be, trusted, if, the, reader, isn, t, hoodwinked, by, the, first, sentence, and, still, thinks, of, gregor, as, a, human, being, he, will, view, the, story, as, conclusive, and, realize, that, gregor, is, a, victim, of, his, own, degeneration, volker, dr, ke, 2013, believes, that, the, crucial, metamorphosis, in, the, story, is, that, of, grete, she, is, the, character, the, title, is, directed, at, gregor, s, metamorphosis, is, followed, by, him, languishing, and, ultimately, dying, grete, by, contrast, has, matured, as, a, result, of, the, new, family, circumstances, and, assumed, responsibility, in, the, end, after, the, brother, s, death, the, parents, also, notice, that, their, daughter, who, was, getting, more, animated, all, the, time, had, recently, blossomed, into, a, pretty, and, shapely, girl, and, they, want, to, look, for, a, partner, for, her, from, this, standpoint, grete, s, transition, her, metamorphosis, from, a, girl, into, a, woman, is, the, subtextual, theme, of, the, story, the, metamorphosis, has, been, translated, into, english, more, than, twenty, times, in, kafka, s, original, the, opening, sentence, is, als, gregor, samsa, eines, morgens, aus, unruhigen, tr, umen, erwachte, fand, er, sich, in, seinem, bett, zu, einem, ungeheuren, ungeziefer, verwandelt, in, their, 1933, translation, of, the, story, the, first, into, english, willa, muir, and, edwin, muir, rendered, it, as, as, gregor, samsa, awoke, one, morning, from, uneasy, dreams, he, found, himself, transformed, in, his, bed, into, a, gigantic, insect, the, phrase, ungeheuren, ungeziefer, describing, the, creature, into, which, gregor, samsa, metamorphoses, has, been, translated, in, at, least, sixteen, different, ways, these, include, the, following, in, middle, high, german, ungeziefer, literally, means, unclean, animal, not, suitable, for, sacrifice, and, is, sometimes, used, colloquially, to, mean, bug, with, the, connotation, of, dirty, nasty, bug, it, can, also, be, translated, as, vermin, english, translators, of, the, metamorphosis, have, often, rendered, it, as, insect, what, kind, of, bug, or, vermin, kafka, envisaged, remains, a, debated, mystery, kafka, had, no, intention, of, labeling, gregor, as, any, specific, thing, but, instead, was, trying, to, convey, gregor, s, disgust, at, his, transformation, in, his, letter, to, his, publisher, of, 25, october, 1915, in, which, he, discusses, his, concern, about, the, cover, illustration, for, the, first, edition, kafka, does, use, the, term, insekt, though, saying, the, insect, itself, is, not, to, be, drawn, it, is, not, even, to, be, seen, from, a, distance, vladimir, nabokov, who, was, a, lepidopterist, as, well, as, a, writer, and, literary, critic, concluded, from, details, in, the, text, that, gregor, was, not, a, cockroach, but, a, beetle, with, wings, under, his, shell, and, capable, of, flight, nabokov, left, a, sketch, annotated, just, over, three, feet, long, on, the, opening, page, of, his, english, teaching, copy, in, his, accompanying, lecture, notes, he, discusses, the, type, of, insect, gregor, has, been, transformed, into, noting, that, the, cleaning, lady, addressed, gregor, as, dung, beetle, mistk, fer, e, g, come, here, for, a, bit, old, dung, beetle, or, hey, look, at, the, old, dung, beetle, nabokov, remarks, that, this, was, just, her, friendly, way, addressing, him, and, that, gregor, is, not, technically, a, dung, beetle, he, is, merely, a, big, beetle, online, editions,
