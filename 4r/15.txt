gothic, architecture, is, an, architectural, style, that, was, prevalent, in, europe, from, the, late, 12th, to, the, 16th, century, during, the, high, and, late, middle, ages, surviving, into, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, in, some, areas, it, evolved, from, romanesque, architecture, and, was, succeeded, by, renaissance, architecture, it, originated, in, the, le, de, france, and, picardy, regions, of, northern, france, the, style, at, the, time, was, sometimes, known, as, opus, francigenum, lit, french, work, the, term, gothic, was, first, applied, contemptuously, during, the, later, renaissance, by, those, ambitious, to, revive, the, architecture, of, classical, antiquity, the, defining, design, element, of, gothic, architecture, is, the, pointed, arch, the, use, of, the, pointed, arch, in, turn, led, to, the, development, of, the, pointed, rib, vault, and, flying, buttresses, combined, with, elaborate, tracery, and, stained, glass, windows, at, the, abbey, of, saint, denis, near, paris, the, choir, was, reconstructed, between, 1140, and, 1144, drawing, together, for, the, first, time, the, developing, gothic, architectural, features, in, doing, so, a, new, architectural, style, emerged, that, emphasized, verticality, and, the, effect, created, by, the, transmission, of, light, through, stained, glass, windows, common, examples, are, found, in, christian, ecclesiastical, architecture, and, gothic, cathedrals, and, churches, as, well, as, abbeys, and, parish, churches, it, is, also, the, architecture, of, many, castles, palaces, town, halls, guildhalls, universities, and, less, prominently, today, private, dwellings, many, of, the, finest, examples, of, medieval, gothic, architecture, are, listed, by, unesco, as, world, heritage, sites, with, the, development, of, renaissance, architecture, in, italy, during, the, mid, 15th, century, the, gothic, style, was, supplanted, by, the, new, style, but, in, some, regions, notably, england, and, belgium, gothic, continued, to, flourish, and, develop, into, the, 16th, century, a, series, of, gothic, revivals, began, in, mid, 18th, century, england, spread, through, 19th, century, europe, and, continued, largely, for, churches, and, university, buildings, into, the, 20th, century, medieval, contemporaries, described, the, style, as, latin, opus, francigenum, lit, french, work, or, frankish, work, as, opus, modernum, modern, work, novum, opus, new, work, or, as, italian, maniera, tedesca, lit, german, style, the, term, gothic, architecture, originated, as, a, pejorative, description, giorgio, vasari, used, the, term, barbarous, german, style, in, his, lives, of, the, artists, to, describe, what, is, now, considered, the, gothic, style, and, in, the, introduction, to, the, lives, he, attributes, various, architectural, features, to, the, goths, whom, he, held, responsible, for, destroying, the, ancient, buildings, after, they, conquered, rome, and, erecting, new, ones, in, this, style, when, vasari, wrote, italy, had, experienced, a, century, of, building, in, the, vitruvian, architectural, vocabulary, of, classical, orders, revived, in, the, renaissance, and, seen, as, evidence, of, a, new, golden, age, of, learning, and, refinement, thus, the, gothic, style, being, in, opposition, to, classical, architecture, from, that, point, of, view, was, associated, with, the, destruction, of, advancement, and, sophistication, the, assumption, that, classical, architecture, was, better, than, gothic, architecture, was, widespread, and, proved, difficult, to, defeat, vasari, was, echoed, in, the, 16th, century, by, fran, ois, rabelais, who, referred, to, goths, and, ostrogoths, gotz, and, ostrogotz, the, polymath, architect, christopher, wren, disapproved, of, the, name, gothic, for, pointed, architecture, he, compared, it, to, islamic, architecture, which, he, called, the, saracen, style, pointing, out, that, the, pointed, arch, s, sophistication, was, not, owed, to, the, goths, but, to, the, islamic, golden, age, he, wrote, this, we, now, call, the, gothic, manner, of, architecture, so, the, italians, called, what, was, not, after, the, roman, style, though, the, goths, were, rather, destroyers, than, builders, i, think, it, should, with, more, reason, be, called, the, saracen, style, for, these, people, wanted, neither, arts, nor, learning, and, after, we, in, the, west, lost, both, we, borrowed, again, from, them, out, of, their, arabic, books, what, they, with, great, diligence, had, translated, from, the, greeks, wren, was, the, first, to, popularize, the, belief, that, it, was, not, the, europeans, but, the, saracens, that, had, created, the, gothic, style, the, term, saracen, was, still, in, use, in, the, 18th, century, and, it, typically, referred, to, all, muslims, including, the, arabs, and, berbers, wren, mentions, europe, s, architectural, debt, to, the, saracens, no, fewer, than, twelve, times, in, his, writings, he, also, decidedly, broke, with, tradition, in, his, assumption, that, gothic, architecture, did, not, merely, represent, a, violent, and, bothersome, mistake, as, suggested, by, vasari, rather, he, saw, that, the, gothic, style, had, developed, over, time, along, the, lines, of, a, changing, society, and, that, it, was, thus, a, legitimate, architectural, style, of, its, own, it, was, no, secret, that, wren, strongly, disliked, the, building, practices, of, the, gothic, style, when, he, was, appointed, surveyor, of, the, fabric, at, westminster, abbey, in, the, year, 1698, he, expressed, his, distaste, for, the, gothic, style, in, a, letter, to, the, bishop, of, rochester, nothing, was, thought, magnificent, that, was, not, high, beyond, measure, with, the, flutter, of, arch, buttresses, so, we, call, the, sloping, arches, that, poise, the, higher, vaultings, of, the, nave, the, romans, always, concealed, their, butments, whereas, the, normans, thought, them, ornamental, these, i, have, observed, are, the, first, things, that, occasion, the, ruin, of, cathedrals, being, so, much, exposed, to, the, air, and, weather, the, coping, which, cannot, defend, them, first, failing, and, if, they, give, way, the, vault, must, spread, pinnacles, are, no, use, and, as, little, ornament, the, chaos, of, the, gothic, left, much, to, be, desired, in, wren, s, eyes, his, aversion, of, the, style, was, so, strong, that, he, refused, to, put, a, gothic, roof, on, the, new, st, paul, s, despite, being, pressured, to, do, so, wren, much, preferred, symmetry, and, straight, lines, in, architecture, which, is, why, he, constantly, praised, the, classic, architecture, of, the, ancients, in, his, writings, even, though, he, openly, expressed, his, distaste, for, the, gothic, style, wren, did, not, blame, the, saracens, for, the, apparent, lack, of, ingenuity, quite, the, opposite, he, praised, the, saracens, for, their, superior, vaulting, techniques, and, their, widespread, use, of, the, pointed, arch, wren, claimed, the, inventors, of, the, gothic, had, seen, the, saracen, architecture, during, the, crusades, also, called, the, religious, war, or, holy, war, organised, by, the, kingdom, of, france, in, the, year, 1095, the, holy, war, gave, the, christians, who, had, been, there, an, idea, of, the, saracen, works, which, were, afterwards, by, them, imitated, in, the, west, and, they, refined, upon, it, every, day, as, they, proceeded, in, building, churches, there, are, several, chronological, issues, that, arise, with, this, statement, which, is, one, of, the, reasons, why, wren, s, theory, is, rejected, by, many, the, earliest, examples, of, the, pointed, arch, in, europe, date, from, before, the, holy, war, in, the, year, 1095, this, is, widely, regarded, as, proof, that, the, gothic, style, could, not, have, possibly, been, derived, from, saracen, architecture, several, authors, have, taken, a, stance, against, this, allegation, claiming, that, the, gothic, style, had, most, likely, filtered, into, europe, in, other, ways, for, example, through, spain, or, sicily, the, spanish, architecture, from, the, moors, could, have, favoured, the, emergence, of, the, gothic, style, long, before, the, crusades, took, place, this, could, have, happened, gradually, through, merchants, travelers, and, pilgrims, according, to, a, 19th, century, correspondent, in, the, london, journal, notes, and, queries, gothic, was, a, derisive, misnomer, the, pointed, arcs, and, architecture, of, the, later, middle, ages, was, quite, different, from, the, rounded, arches, prevalent, in, late, antiquity, and, the, period, of, the, ostrogothic, kingdom, in, italy, there, can, be, no, doubt, that, the, term, gothic, as, applied, to, pointed, styles, of, ecclesiastical, architecture, was, used, at, first, contemptuously, and, in, derision, by, those, who, were, ambitious, to, imitate, and, revive, the, grecian, orders, of, architecture, after, the, revival, of, classical, literature, but, without, citing, many, authorities, such, as, christopher, wren, and, others, who, lent, their, aid, in, depreciating, the, old, mediaeval, style, which, they, termed, gothic, as, synonymous, with, every, thing, that, was, barbarous, and, rude, it, may, be, sufficient, to, refer, to, the, celebrated, treatise, of, sir, henry, wotton, entitled, the, elements, of, architecture, printed, in, london, so, early, as, 1624, but, it, was, a, strange, misapplication, of, the, term, to, use, it, for, the, pointed, style, in, contradistinction, to, the, circular, formerly, called, saxon, now, norman, romanesque, c, these, latter, styles, like, lombardic, italian, and, the, byzantine, of, course, belong, more, to, the, gothic, period, than, the, light, and, elegant, structures, of, the, pointed, order, which, succeeded, them, the, gothic, style, of, architecture, was, strongly, influenced, by, the, romanesque, architecture, which, preceded, it, by, the, growing, population, and, wealth, of, european, cities, and, by, the, desire, to, express, local, grandeur, it, was, influenced, by, theological, doctrines, which, called, for, more, light, and, by, technical, improvements, in, vaults, and, buttresses, that, allowed, much, greater, height, and, larger, windows, it, was, also, influenced, by, the, necessity, of, many, churches, such, as, chartres, cathedral, and, canterbury, cathedral, to, accommodate, growing, numbers, of, pilgrims, it, adapted, features, from, earlier, styles, according, to, charles, texier, french, historian, architect, and, archaeologist, and, josef, strzygowski, polish, austrian, art, historian, after, lengthy, research, and, study, of, cathedrals, in, the, medieval, city, of, ani, the, capital, of, the, medieval, kingdom, of, armenia, concluded, to, have, discovered, the, oldest, gothic, arch, according, to, these, historians, the, architecture, of, the, saint, hripsime, church, near, the, armenian, religious, seat, etchmiadzin, was, built, in, the, fourth, century, a, d, and, was, repaired, in, 618, the, cathedral, of, ani, was, built, in, 980, 1012, a, d, however, many, of, the, elements, of, islamic, and, armenian, architecture, that, have, been, cited, as, influences, on, gothic, architecture, also, appeared, in, late, roman, and, byzantine, architecture, the, most, noticeable, example, being, the, pointed, arch, and, flying, buttress, the, most, notable, example, is, the, capitals, which, are, forerunners, of, the, gothic, style, and, deviated, from, the, classical, standards, of, ancient, greece, and, rome, with, serpentine, lines, and, naturalistic, forms, architecture, became, a, leading, form, of, artistic, expression, during, the, late, middle, ages, gothic, architecture, began, in, the, earlier, 12th, century, in, northwest, france, and, england, and, spread, throughout, latin, europe, in, the, 13th, century, by, 1300, a, first, international, style, of, gothic, had, developed, with, common, design, features, and, formal, language, a, second, international, style, emerged, by, 1400, alongside, innovations, in, england, and, central, europe, that, produced, both, the, perpendicular, and, flamboyant, varieties, typically, these, typologies, are, identified, as, norman, architecture, on, either, side, of, the, english, channel, developed, in, parallel, towards, early, gothic, gothic, features, such, as, the, rib, vault, had, appeared, in, england, sicily, and, normandy, in, the, 11th, century, rib, vaults, were, employed, in, some, parts, of, the, cathedral, at, durham, 1093, and, in, lessay, abbey, in, normandy, 1098, however, the, first, buildings, to, be, considered, fully, gothic, are, the, royal, funerary, abbey, of, the, french, kings, the, abbey, of, saint, denis, 1135, 1144, and, the, archiepiscopal, cathedral, at, sens, 1135, 1164, they, were, the, first, buildings, to, systematically, combine, rib, vaulting, buttresses, and, pointed, arches, most, of, the, characteristics, of, later, early, english, were, already, present, in, the, lower, chevet, of, saint, denis, the, duchy, of, normandy, part, of, the, angevin, empire, until, the, 13th, century, developed, its, own, version, of, gothic, one, of, these, was, the, norman, chevet, a, small, apse, or, chapel, attached, to, the, choir, at, the, east, end, of, the, church, which, typically, had, a, half, dome, the, lantern, tower, was, another, common, feature, in, norman, gothic, one, example, of, early, norman, gothic, is, bayeux, cathedral, 1060, 1070, where, the, romanesque, cathedral, nave, and, choir, were, rebuilt, into, the, gothic, style, lisieux, cathedral, was, begun, in, 1170, rouen, cathedral, begun, 1185, was, rebuilt, from, romanesque, to, gothic, with, distinct, norman, features, including, a, lantern, tower, deeply, moulded, decoration, and, high, pointed, arcades, coutances, cathedral, was, remade, into, gothic, beginning, about, 1220, its, most, distinctive, feature, is, the, octagonal, lantern, on, the, crossing, of, the, transept, decorated, with, ornamental, ribs, and, surrounded, by, sixteen, bays, and, sixteen, lancet, windows, saint, denis, was, the, work, of, the, abbot, suger, a, close, adviser, of, kings, louis, vi, and, louis, vii, suger, reconstructed, portions, of, the, old, romanesque, church, with, the, rib, vault, in, order, to, remove, walls, and, to, make, more, space, for, windows, he, described, the, new, ambulatory, as, a, circular, ring, of, chapels, by, virtue, of, which, the, whole, church, would, shine, with, the, wonderful, and, uninterrupted, light, of, most, luminous, windows, pervading, the, interior, beauty, to, support, the, vaults, he, also, introduced, columns, with, capitals, of, carved, vegetal, designs, modelled, upon, the, classical, columns, he, had, seen, in, rome, in, addition, he, installed, a, circular, rose, window, over, the, portal, on, the, fa, ade, these, also, became, a, common, feature, of, gothic, cathedrals, some, elements, of, gothic, style, appeared, very, early, in, england, durham, cathedral, was, the, first, cathedral, to, employ, a, rib, vault, built, between, 1093, and, 1104, the, first, cathedral, built, entirely, in, the, new, style, was, sens, cathedral, begun, between, 1135, and, 1140, and, consecrated, in, 1160, sens, cathedral, features, a, gothic, choir, and, six, part, rib, vaults, over, the, nave, and, collateral, aisles, alternating, pillars, and, doubled, columns, to, support, the, vaults, and, buttresses, to, offset, the, outward, thrust, from, the, vaults, one, of, the, builders, who, is, believed, to, have, worked, on, sens, cathedral, william, of, sens, later, travelled, to, england, and, became, the, architect, who, between, 1175, and, 1180, reconstructed, the, choir, of, canterbury, cathedral, in, the, new, gothic, style, sens, cathedral, was, influential, in, its, strongly, vertical, appearance, and, in, its, three, part, elevation, typical, of, subsequent, gothic, buildings, with, a, clerestory, at, the, top, supported, by, a, triforium, all, carried, on, high, arcades, of, pointed, arches, in, the, following, decades, flying, buttresses, began, to, be, used, allowing, the, construction, of, lighter, higher, walls, french, gothic, churches, were, heavily, influenced, both, by, the, ambulatory, and, side, chapels, around, the, choir, at, saint, denis, and, by, the, paired, towers, and, triple, doors, on, the, western, fa, ade, sens, was, quickly, followed, by, senlis, cathedral, begun, 1160, and, notre, dame, de, paris, begun, 1160, their, builders, abandoned, the, traditional, plans, and, introduced, the, new, gothic, elements, from, saint, denis, the, builders, of, notre, dame, went, further, by, introducing, the, flying, buttress, heavy, columns, of, support, outside, the, walls, connected, by, arches, to, the, upper, walls, the, buttresses, counterbalanced, the, outward, thrust, from, the, rib, vaults, this, allowed, the, builders, to, construct, higher, thinner, walls, and, larger, windows, following, the, destruction, by, fire, of, the, choir, of, canterbury, cathedral, in, 1174, a, group, of, master, builders, was, invited, to, propose, plans, for, the, reconstruction, the, master, builder, william, of, sens, who, had, worked, on, sens, cathedral, won, the, competition, work, began, that, same, year, but, in, 1178, william, was, badly, injured, by, falling, from, the, scaffolding, and, returned, to, france, where, he, died, his, work, was, continued, by, william, the, englishman, who, replaced, his, french, namesake, in, 1178, the, resulting, structure, of, the, choir, of, canterbury, cathedral, is, considered, the, first, work, of, early, english, gothic, the, cathedral, churches, of, worcester, 1175, wells, c, 1180, lincoln, 1192, and, salisbury, 1220, are, all, with, canterbury, major, examples, tiercerons, decorative, vaulting, ribs, seem, first, to, have, been, used, in, vaulting, at, lincoln, cathedral, installed, c, 1200, instead, of, a, triforium, early, english, churches, usually, retained, a, gallery, high, gothic, c, 1194, 1250, was, a, brief, but, very, productive, period, which, produced, some, of, the, great, landmarks, of, gothic, art, the, first, building, in, the, high, gothic, french, classique, was, chartres, cathedral, an, important, pilgrimage, church, south, of, paris, the, romanesque, cathedral, was, destroyed, by, fire, in, 1194, but, was, swiftly, rebuilt, in, the, new, style, with, contributions, from, king, philip, ii, of, france, pope, celestine, iii, local, gentry, merchants, craftsmen, and, richard, the, lionheart, king, of, england, the, builders, simplified, the, elevation, used, at, notre, dame, eliminated, the, tribune, galleries, and, used, flying, buttresses, to, support, the, upper, walls, the, walls, were, filled, with, stained, glass, mainly, depicting, the, story, of, the, virgin, mary, but, also, in, a, small, corner, of, each, window, illustrating, the, crafts, of, the, guilds, who, donated, those, windows, the, model, of, chartres, was, followed, by, a, series, of, new, cathedrals, of, unprecedented, height, and, size, these, were, reims, cathedral, begun, 1211, where, coronations, of, the, kings, of, france, took, place, amiens, cathedral, 1220, 1226, bourges, cathedral, 1195, 1230, which, unlike, the, others, continued, to, use, six, part, rib, vaults, and, beauvais, cathedral, 1225, in, central, europe, the, high, gothic, style, appeared, in, the, holy, roman, empire, first, at, toul, 1220, whose, romanesque, cathedral, was, rebuilt, in, the, style, of, reims, cathedral, then, trier, s, liebfrauenkirche, parish, church, 1228, and, then, throughout, the, reich, beginning, with, the, elisabethkirche, at, marburg, 1235, and, the, cathedral, at, metz, c, 1235, in, high, gothic, the, whole, surface, of, the, clerestory, was, given, over, to, windows, at, chartres, cathedral, plate, tracery, was, used, for, the, rose, window, but, at, reims, the, bar, tracery, was, free, standing, lancet, windows, were, supplanted, by, multiple, lights, separated, by, geometrical, bar, tracery, tracery, of, this, kind, distinguishes, middle, pointed, style, from, the, simpler, first, pointed, inside, the, nave, was, divided, into, by, regular, bays, each, covered, by, a, quadripartite, rib, vaults, other, characteristics, of, the, high, gothic, were, the, development, of, rose, windows, of, greater, size, using, bar, tracery, higher, and, longer, flying, buttresses, which, could, reach, up, to, the, highest, windows, and, walls, of, sculpture, illustrating, biblical, stories, filling, the, fa, ade, and, the, fronts, of, the, transept, reims, cathedral, had, two, thousand, three, hundred, statues, on, the, front, and, back, side, of, the, fa, ade, the, new, high, gothic, churches, competed, to, be, the, tallest, with, increasingly, ambitious, structures, lifting, the, vault, yet, higher, chartres, cathedral, s, height, of, 38, m, 125, ft, was, exceeded, by, beauvais, cathedral, s, 48, m, 157, ft, but, on, account, of, the, latter, s, collapse, in, 1248, no, further, attempt, was, made, to, build, higher, attention, turned, from, achieving, greater, height, to, creating, more, awe, inspiring, decoration, rayonnant, gothic, maximized, the, coverage, of, stained, glass, windows, such, that, the, walls, are, effectively, entirely, glazed, examples, are, the, nave, of, saint, denis, 1231, and, the, royal, chapel, of, louis, ix, of, france, on, the, le, de, la, cit, in, the, seine, the, sainte, chapelle, c, 1241, 1248, the, high, and, thin, walls, of, french, rayonnant, gothic, allowed, by, the, flying, buttresses, enabled, increasingly, ambitious, expanses, of, glass, and, decorated, tracery, reinforced, with, ironwork, shortly, after, saint, denis, in, the, 1250s, louis, ix, commissioned, the, rebuilt, transepts, and, enormous, rose, windows, of, notre, dame, de, paris, 1250s, for, the, north, transept, 1258, for, the, beginning, of, south, transept, this, first, international, style, was, also, used, in, the, clerestory, of, metz, cathedral, c, 1245, then, in, the, choir, of, cologne, s, cathedral, c, 1250, and, again, in, the, nave, of, the, cathedral, at, strasbourg, c, 1250, masons, elaborated, a, series, of, tracery, patterns, for, windows, from, the, basic, geometrical, to, the, reticulated, and, the, curvilinear, which, had, superseded, the, lancet, window, bar, tracery, of, the, curvilinear, flowing, and, reticulated, types, distinguish, second, pointed, style, decorated, gothic, similarly, sought, to, emphasize, the, windows, but, excelled, in, the, ornamentation, of, their, tracery, churches, with, features, of, this, style, include, westminster, abbey, 1245, the, cathedrals, at, lichfield, after, 1257, and, exeter, 1275, bath, abbey, 1298, and, the, retro, choir, at, wells, cathedral, c, 1320, the, rayonnant, developed, its, second, international, style, with, increasingly, autonomous, and, sharp, edged, tracery, mouldings, apparent, in, the, cathedral, at, clermont, ferrand, 1248, the, papal, collegiate, church, at, troyes, saint, urbain, 1262, and, the, west, fa, ade, of, strasbourg, cathedral, 1276, 1439, by, 1300, there, were, examples, influenced, by, strasbourg, in, the, cathedrals, of, limoges, 1273, regensburg, c, 1275, and, in, the, cathedral, nave, at, york, 1292, central, europe, began, to, lead, the, emergence, of, a, new, international, flamboyant, style, with, the, construction, of, a, new, cathedral, at, prague, 1344, under, the, direction, of, peter, parler, this, model, of, rich, and, variegated, tracery, and, intricate, reticulated, rib, vaulting, was, definitive, in, the, late, gothic, of, continental, europe, emulated, not, only, by, the, collegiate, churches, and, cathedrals, but, by, urban, parish, churches, which, rivalled, them, in, size, and, magnificence, the, minster, at, ulm, and, other, parish, churches, like, the, heilig, kreuz, m, nster, at, schw, bisch, gm, nd, c, 1320, st, barbara, s, church, at, kutn, hora, 1389, and, the, heilig, geist, kirche, 1407, and, st, martin, s, church, c, 1385, in, landshut, are, typical, use, of, ogees, was, especially, common, the, flamboyant, style, was, characterised, by, the, multiplication, of, the, ribs, of, the, vaults, with, new, purely, decorative, ribs, called, tiercons, and, liernes, and, additional, diagonal, ribs, one, common, ornament, of, flamboyant, in, france, is, the, arc, en, accolade, an, arch, over, a, window, topped, by, a, pinnacle, which, was, itself, topped, with, fleuron, and, flanked, by, other, pinnacles, examples, of, french, flamboyant, building, include, the, west, fa, ade, of, rouen, cathedral, and, especially, the, fa, ades, of, sainte, chapelle, de, vincennes, 1370s, and, choir, mont, saint, michel, s, abbey, church, 1448, in, england, ornamental, rib, vaulting, and, tracery, of, decorated, gothic, co, existed, with, and, then, gave, way, to, the, perpendicular, style, from, the, 1320s, with, straightened, orthogonal, tracery, topped, with, fan, vaulting, perpendicular, gothic, was, unknown, in, continental, europe, and, unlike, earlier, styles, had, no, equivalent, in, scotland, or, ireland, it, first, appeared, in, the, cloisters, and, chapter, house, c, 1332, of, old, st, paul, s, cathedral, in, london, by, william, de, ramsey, the, chancel, of, gloucester, cathedral, c, 1337, 1357, and, its, latter, 14th, century, cloisters, are, early, examples, four, centred, arches, were, often, used, and, lierne, vaults, seen, in, early, buildings, were, developed, into, fan, vaults, first, at, the, latter, 14th, century, chapter, house, of, hereford, cathedral, demolished, 1769, and, cloisters, at, gloucester, and, then, at, reginald, ely, s, king, s, college, chapel, cambridge, 1446, 1461, and, the, brothers, william, and, robert, vertue, s, henry, vii, chapel, c, 1503, 1512, at, westminster, abbey, perpendicular, is, sometimes, called, third, pointed, and, was, employed, over, three, centuries, the, fan, vaulted, staircase, at, christ, church, oxford, built, around, 1640, lacey, patterns, of, tracery, continued, to, characterize, continental, gothic, building, with, very, elaborate, and, articulated, vaulting, as, at, saint, barbara, s, kutn, hora, 1512, in, certain, areas, gothic, architecture, continued, to, be, employed, until, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, especially, in, provincial, and, ecclesiastical, contexts, notably, at, oxford, beginning, in, the, mid, 15th, century, the, gothic, style, gradually, lost, its, dominance, in, europe, it, had, never, been, popular, in, italy, and, in, the, mid, 15th, century, the, italians, drawing, upon, ancient, roman, ruins, returned, to, classical, models, the, dome, of, florence, cathedral, 1420, 1436, by, filippo, brunelleschi, inspired, by, the, pantheon, rome, was, one, of, the, first, renaissance, landmarks, but, it, also, employed, gothic, technology, the, outer, skin, of, the, dome, was, supported, by, a, framework, of, twenty, four, ribs, in, the, 16th, century, as, renaissance, architecture, from, italy, began, to, appear, in, france, and, other, countries, in, europe, the, gothic, style, began, to, be, described, as, outdated, ugly, and, even, barbaric, the, term, gothic, was, first, used, as, a, pejorative, description, giorgio, vasari, used, the, term, barbarous, german, style, in, his, 1550, lives, of, the, artists, to, describe, what, is, now, considered, the, gothic, style, in, the, introduction, to, the, lives, he, attributed, various, architectural, features, to, the, goths, whom, he, held, responsible, for, destroying, the, ancient, buildings, after, they, conquered, rome, and, erecting, new, ones, in, this, style, in, the, 17th, century, moli, re, also, mocked, the, gothic, style, in, the, 1669, poem, la, gloire, the, insipid, taste, of, gothic, ornamentation, these, odious, monstrosities, of, an, ignorant, age, produced, by, the, torrents, of, barbarism, the, dominant, styles, in, europe, became, in, turn, italian, renaissance, architecture, baroque, architecture, and, the, grand, classicism, of, the, style, louis, xiv, the, kings, of, france, had, first, hand, knowledge, of, the, new, italian, style, because, of, the, military, campaign, of, charles, viii, to, naples, and, milan, 1494, and, especially, the, campaigns, of, louis, xii, and, francis, i, 1500, 1505, to, restore, french, control, over, milan, and, genoa, they, brought, back, italian, paintings, sculpture, and, building, plans, and, more, importantly, italian, craftsmen, and, artists, the, cardinal, georges, d, amboise, chief, minister, of, louis, xii, built, the, chateau, of, gaillon, near, rouen, 1502, 1510, with, the, assistance, of, italian, craftsmen, the, ch, teau, de, blois, 1515, 1524, introduced, the, renaissance, loggia, and, open, stairway, king, francois, i, installed, leonardo, da, vinci, at, his, chateau, of, chambord, in, 1516, and, introduced, a, renaissance, long, gallery, at, the, palace, of, fontainebleau, in, 1528, 1540, in, 1546, francois, i, began, building, the, first, example, of, french, classicism, the, square, courtyard, of, the, louvre, palace, designed, by, pierre, lescot, nonetheless, new, gothic, buildings, particularly, churches, continued, to, be, built, new, gothic, churches, built, in, paris, in, this, period, included, saint, merri, 1520, 1552, and, saint, germain, l, auxerrois, the, first, signs, of, classicism, in, paris, churches, did, not, appear, until, 1540, at, saint, gervais, saint, protais, the, largest, new, church, saint, eustache, 1532, 1560, rivalled, notre, dame, in, size, 105, m, 344, ft, long, 44, m, 144, ft, wide, and, 35, m, 115, ft, high, as, construction, of, this, church, continued, elements, of, renaissance, decoration, including, the, system, of, classical, orders, of, columns, were, added, to, the, design, making, it, a, gothic, renaissance, hybrid, in, germany, some, italian, elements, were, introduced, at, the, fugger, chapel, of, st, anne, s, church, augsburg, 1510, 1512, combined, with, gothic, vaults, and, others, appeared, in, the, church, of, st, michael, in, munich, but, in, germany, renaissance, elements, were, used, primarily, for, decoration, some, renaissance, elements, also, appeared, in, spain, in, the, new, palace, begun, by, emperor, charles, v, in, granada, within, the, alhambra, 1485, 1550, inspired, by, bramante, and, raphael, but, it, was, never, completed, the, first, major, renaissance, work, in, spain, was, el, escorial, the, monastery, palace, built, by, philip, ii, of, spain, under, henry, viii, and, elizabeth, i, england, was, largely, isolated, from, architectural, developments, on, the, continent, the, first, classical, building, in, england, was, the, old, somerset, house, in, london, 1547, 1552, since, demolished, built, by, edward, seymour, 1st, duke, of, somerset, who, was, regent, as, lord, protector, for, edward, vi, until, the, young, king, came, of, age, in, 1547, somerset, s, successor, john, dudley, 1st, duke, of, northumberland, sent, the, architectural, scholar, john, shute, to, italy, to, study, the, style, shute, published, the, first, book, in, english, on, classical, architecture, in, 1570, the, first, english, houses, in, the, new, style, were, burghley, house, 1550s, 1580s, and, longleat, built, by, associates, of, somerset, with, those, buildings, a, new, age, of, architecture, began, in, england, gothic, architecture, usually, churches, or, university, buildings, continued, to, be, built, ireland, was, an, island, of, gothic, architecture, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, with, the, construction, of, derry, cathedral, completed, 1633, sligo, cathedral, c, 1730, and, down, cathedral, 1790, 1818, are, other, examples, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, century, several, important, gothic, buildings, were, constructed, at, oxford, university, and, cambridge, university, including, tom, tower, 1681, 82, at, christ, church, oxford, by, christopher, wren, it, also, appeared, in, a, whimsical, fashion, in, horace, walpole, s, twickenham, villa, strawberry, hill, 1749, 1776, the, two, western, towers, of, westminster, abbey, were, constructed, between, 1722, and, 1745, by, nicholas, hawksmoor, opening, a, new, period, of, gothic, revival, gothic, architecture, survived, the, early, modern, period, and, flourished, again, in, a, revival, from, the, late, 18th, century, and, throughout, the, 19th, perpendicular, was, the, first, gothic, style, revived, in, the, 18th, century, in, england, partly, in, response, to, a, philosophy, propounded, by, the, oxford, movement, and, others, associated, with, the, emerging, revival, of, high, church, or, anglo, catholic, ideas, during, the, second, quarter, of, the, 19th, century, neo, gothic, began, to, become, promoted, by, influential, establishment, figures, as, the, preferred, style, for, ecclesiastical, civic, and, institutional, architecture, the, appeal, of, this, gothic, revival, which, after, 1837, in, britain, is, sometimes, termed, victorian, gothic, gradually, widened, to, encompass, low, church, as, well, as, high, church, clients, this, period, of, more, universal, appeal, spanning, 1855, 1885, is, known, in, britain, as, high, victorian, gothic, the, palace, of, westminster, in, london, by, sir, charles, barry, with, interiors, by, a, major, exponent, of, the, early, gothic, revival, augustus, welby, pugin, is, an, example, of, the, gothic, revival, style, from, its, earlier, period, in, the, second, quarter, of, the, 19th, century, examples, from, the, high, victorian, gothic, period, include, george, gilbert, scott, s, design, for, the, albert, memorial, in, london, and, william, butterfield, s, chapel, at, keble, college, oxford, from, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, onwards, it, became, more, common, in, britain, for, neo, gothic, to, be, used, in, the, design, of, non, ecclesiastical, and, non, governmental, buildings, types, gothic, details, even, began, to, appear, in, working, class, housing, schemes, subsidised, by, philanthropy, though, given, the, expense, less, frequently, than, in, the, design, of, upper, and, middle, class, housing, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, was, a, period, marked, by, the, restoration, and, in, some, cases, modification, of, ancient, monuments, and, the, construction, of, neo, gothic, edifices, such, as, the, nave, of, cologne, cathedral, and, the, sainte, clotilde, of, paris, as, speculation, of, mediaeval, architecture, turned, to, technical, consideration, london, s, palace, of, westminster, st, pancras, railway, station, new, york, s, trinity, church, and, st, patrick, s, cathedral, are, also, famous, examples, of, gothic, revival, buildings, the, style, also, reached, the, far, east, in, the, period, for, instance, the, anglican, st, john, s, cathedral, located, at, the, centre, of, victoria, city, in, central, hong, kong, the, defining, characteristic, of, the, gothic, style, is, the, pointed, arch, which, was, widely, used, in, both, structure, and, decoration, the, pointed, arch, did, not, originate, in, gothic, architecture, they, had, been, employed, for, centuries, in, the, near, east, in, pre, islamic, as, well, as, islamic, architecture, for, arches, arcades, and, ribbed, vaults, in, gothic, architecture, particularly, in, the, later, gothic, styles, they, became, the, most, visible, and, characteristic, element, giving, a, sensation, of, verticality, and, pointing, upward, like, the, spires, gothic, rib, vaults, covered, the, nave, and, pointed, arches, were, commonly, used, for, the, arcades, windows, doorways, in, the, tracery, and, especially, in, the, later, gothic, styles, decorating, the, fa, ades, they, were, also, sometimes, used, for, more, practical, purposes, such, as, to, bring, transverse, vaults, to, the, same, height, as, diagonal, vaults, as, in, the, nave, and, aisles, of, durham, cathedral, built, in, 1093, the, earliest, gothic, pointed, arches, were, lancet, lights, or, lancet, windows, which, are, narrow, windows, terminating, in, a, lancet, arch, a, lancet, arch, has, a, radius, longer, than, their, breadth, width, and, resembles, the, blade, of, a, lancet, in, the, 12th, century, first, pointed, phase, of, gothic, architecture, also, called, the, lancet, style, and, before, the, introduction, of, tracery, in, the, windows, in, later, styles, lancet, windows, predominated, gothic, building, the, flamboyant, style, of, gothic, architecture, is, particularly, known, for, lavish, pointed, details, such, as, the, arc, en, accolade, where, a, pointed, arch, over, a, doorway, was, topped, by, a, pointed, sculptural, ornament, called, a, fleuron, and, by, pointed, pinnacles, on, either, side, the, arches, of, the, doorway, were, further, decorated, with, small, cabbage, shaped, sculptures, called, chou, fris, s, the, gothic, rib, vault, was, one, of, the, essential, elements, that, made, the, great, height, and, large, windows, of, gothic, architecture, possible, unlike, the, semi, circular, barrel, vault, of, roman, and, romanesque, buildings, where, the, weight, pressed, directly, downward, and, required, thick, walls, and, small, windows, the, gothic, rib, vault, was, made, of, diagonal, crossing, arched, ribs, these, ribs, directed, the, thrust, outwards, to, the, corners, of, the, vault, and, downwards, via, slender, colonnettes, and, bundled, columns, to, the, pillars, and, columns, below, the, space, between, the, ribs, was, filled, with, thin, panels, of, small, pieces, of, stone, which, were, much, lighter, than, earlier, groin, vaults, the, outward, thrust, against, the, walls, was, countered, by, the, weight, of, buttresses, and, later, flying, buttresses, as, a, result, the, massive, thick, walls, of, romanesque, buildings, were, no, longer, needed, as, since, the, vaults, were, supported, by, columns, and, piers, the, walls, could, be, made, thinner, and, higher, and, filled, with, windows, the, earlier, gothic, rib, vaults, used, at, sens, cathedral, begun, between, 1135, and, 1140, and, notre, dame, de, paris, begun, 1163, were, divided, by, the, ribs, into, six, compartments, they, were, very, difficult, to, build, and, could, only, cross, a, limited, space, since, each, vault, covered, two, bays, they, needed, support, on, the, ground, floor, from, alternating, columns, and, piers, in, later, construction, the, design, was, simplified, and, the, rib, vaults, were, divided, into, only, four, compartments, the, alternating, rows, of, alternating, columns, and, piers, receiving, the, vaults, weight, were, replaced, by, simple, pillars, each, receiving, the, same, weight, a, single, vault, could, cross, the, nave, this, method, was, used, at, chartres, cathedral, 1194, 1220, amiens, cathedral, begun, 1220, and, reims, cathedral, the, four, part, vaults, made, it, possible, for, taller, buildings, to, be, constructed, notre, dame, which, had, begun, with, six, part, vaults, reached, a, height, of, 35, m, 115, ft, amiens, cathedral, which, had, begun, with, the, newer, four, part, ribs, reached, a, height, of, 42, 3, m, 139, ft, at, the, transept, in, france, the, four, part, rib, vault, with, two, diagonals, crossing, at, the, center, of, the, traverse, was, the, type, used, almost, exclusively, until, the, end, of, the, gothic, period, however, in, england, several, imaginative, new, vaults, were, invented, which, had, more, elaborate, decorative, features, they, became, a, signature, of, the, later, english, gothic, styles, the, first, of, these, new, vaults, had, an, additional, rib, called, a, tierceron, which, ran, down, the, median, of, the, vault, it, first, appeared, in, the, vaults, of, the, choir, of, lincoln, cathedral, at, the, end, of, the, 12th, century, then, at, worcester, cathedral, in, 1224, and, then, the, south, transept, of, lichfield, cathedral, the, 14th, century, brought, the, invention, of, several, new, types, of, vaults, which, were, more, and, more, decorative, these, vaults, often, copied, the, forms, form, of, the, elaborate, tracery, of, the, late, gothic, styles, these, included, the, stellar, vault, where, a, group, of, additional, ribs, between, the, principal, ribs, forms, a, star, design, the, oldest, vaults, of, this, kind, were, found, in, the, crypt, of, saint, stephen, at, westminster, palace, built, about, 1320, a, second, type, was, called, a, reticulated, vault, which, had, a, network, of, additional, decorative, ribs, in, triangles, and, other, geometric, forms, placed, between, or, over, the, traverse, ribs, these, were, first, used, in, the, choir, of, bristol, cathedral, in, about, 1311, another, late, gothic, form, the, fan, vault, with, ribs, spreading, upwards, and, outwards, appeared, later, in, the, 14th, century, an, example, is, the, cloister, of, gloucester, cathedral, c, 1370, another, new, form, was, the, skeleton, vault, which, appeared, in, the, english, decorated, style, it, has, an, additional, network, of, ribs, like, the, ribs, of, an, umbrella, which, criss, cross, the, vault, but, are, only, directly, attached, to, it, at, certain, points, it, appeared, in, a, chapel, of, lincoln, cathedral, in, 1300, and, then, several, other, english, churches, this, style, of, vault, was, adopted, in, the, 14th, century, in, particular, by, german, architects, particularly, peter, parler, and, in, other, parts, of, central, europe, another, exists, in, the, south, porch, of, the, prague, cathedral, elaborate, vaults, also, appeared, in, civic, architecture, an, example, is, the, ceiling, of, the, vladislav, hall, in, prague, castle, in, bohemia, designed, by, benedikt, ried, in, 1493, the, ribs, twist, and, intertwine, in, fantasy, patterns, which, later, critics, called, rococo, gothic, in, early, french, gothic, architecture, the, capitals, of, the, columns, were, modeled, after, roman, columns, of, the, corinthian, order, with, finely, sculpted, leaves, they, were, used, in, the, ambulatory, of, the, abbey, church, of, saint, denis, according, to, its, builder, the, abbot, suger, they, were, inspired, by, the, columns, he, had, seen, in, the, ancient, baths, in, rome, they, were, used, later, at, sens, at, notre, dame, de, paris, and, at, canterbury, in, england, in, early, gothic, churches, with, six, part, rib, vaults, the, columns, in, the, nave, alternated, with, more, massive, piers, to, provide, support, for, the, vaults, with, the, introduction, of, the, four, part, rib, vault, all, of, the, piers, or, columns, in, the, nave, could, have, the, same, design, in, the, high, gothic, period, a, new, form, was, introduced, composed, of, a, central, core, surrounded, several, attached, slender, columns, or, colonettes, going, up, to, the, vaults, these, clustered, columns, were, used, at, chartres, amiens, reims, and, bourges, westminster, abbey, and, salisbury, cathedral, another, variation, was, a, quadrilobe, column, shaped, like, a, clover, formed, of, four, attached, columns, in, england, the, clustered, columns, were, often, ornamented, with, stone, rings, as, well, as, columns, with, carved, leaves, later, styles, added, further, variations, sometimes, the, piers, were, rectangular, and, fluted, as, at, seville, cathedral, in, england, parts, of, columns, sometimes, had, contrasting, colours, using, combining, white, stone, with, dark, purbeck, marble, in, place, of, the, corinthian, capital, some, columns, used, a, stiff, leaf, design, in, later, gothic, the, piers, became, much, taller, reaching, up, more, than, half, of, the, nave, another, variation, particularly, popular, in, eastern, france, was, a, column, without, a, capital, which, continued, upward, without, capitals, or, other, interruption, all, the, way, to, the, vaults, giving, a, dramatic, display, of, verticality, an, important, feature, of, gothic, architecture, was, the, flying, buttress, a, half, arch, outside, the, building, which, carried, the, thrust, of, weight, of, the, roof, or, vaults, inside, over, a, roof, or, an, aisle, to, a, heavy, stone, column, the, buttresses, were, placed, in, rows, on, either, side, of, the, building, and, were, often, topped, by, heavy, stone, pinnacles, both, to, give, extra, weight, and, for, additional, decoration, buttresses, had, existed, since, roman, times, usually, set, directly, against, the, building, but, the, gothic, vaults, were, more, sophisticated, in, later, structures, the, buttresses, often, had, several, arches, each, reaching, in, to, a, different, level, of, the, structure, the, buttresses, permitted, the, buildings, to, be, both, taller, and, to, have, thinner, walls, with, greater, space, for, windows, over, time, the, buttresses, and, pinnacles, became, more, elaborate, supporting, statues, and, other, decoration, as, at, beauvais, cathedral, and, reims, cathedral, the, arches, had, an, additional, practical, purpose, they, contained, lead, channels, which, carried, rainwater, off, the, roof, it, was, expelled, from, the, mouths, of, stone, gargoyles, placed, in, rows, on, the, buttresses, flying, buttresses, were, used, less, frequently, in, england, where, the, emphasis, was, more, on, length, than, height, one, example, of, english, buttresses, was, canterbury, cathedral, whose, choir, and, buttresses, were, rebuilt, in, gothic, style, by, william, of, sens, and, william, the, englishman, however, they, were, very, popular, in, germany, in, cologne, cathedral, the, buttresses, were, lavishly, decorated, with, statuary, and, other, ornament, and, were, a, prominent, feature, of, the, exterior, towers, spires, and, fl, ches, were, an, important, feature, of, gothic, churches, they, presented, a, dramatic, spectacle, of, great, height, helped, make, their, churches, the, tallest, and, most, visible, buildings, in, their, city, and, symbolised, the, aspirations, of, their, builders, toward, heaven, they, also, had, a, practical, purpose, they, often, served, as, bell, towers, supporting, belfries, whose, bells, told, the, time, by, announcing, religious, services, warned, of, fire, or, enemy, attack, and, celebrated, special, occasions, like, military, victories, and, coronations, sometimes, the, bell, tower, is, built, separate, from, a, church, the, best, known, example, of, this, is, the, leaning, tower, of, pisa, the, towers, of, cathedrals, were, usually, the, last, part, of, the, structure, to, be, built, since, cathedral, construction, usually, took, many, years, and, was, extremely, expensive, by, the, time, the, tower, were, to, be, built, public, enthusiasm, waned, and, tastes, changed, many, projected, towers, were, never, built, or, were, built, in, different, styles, than, other, parts, of, the, cathedral, or, with, different, styles, on, each, level, of, the, tower, at, chartres, cathedral, the, south, tower, was, built, in, the, 12th, century, in, the, simpler, early, gothic, while, the, north, tower, is, the, more, highly, decorated, flamboyant, style, chartres, would, have, been, even, more, exuberant, if, the, second, plan, had, been, followed, it, called, for, seven, towers, around, the, transept, and, sanctuary, in, the, le, de, france, cathedral, towers, followed, the, romanesque, tradition, of, two, identical, towers, one, on, either, side, of, the, portals, the, west, front, of, the, saint, denis, became, the, model, for, the, early, gothic, cathedrals, and, high, gothic, cathedrals, in, northern, france, including, notre, dame, de, paris, reims, cathedral, and, amiens, cathedral, the, early, and, high, gothic, laon, cathedral, has, a, square, lantern, tower, over, the, crossing, of, the, transept, two, towers, on, the, western, front, and, two, towers, on, the, ends, of, the, transepts, laon, s, towers, with, the, exception, of, the, central, tower, are, built, with, two, stacked, vaulted, chambers, pierced, by, lancet, openings, the, two, western, towers, contain, life, size, stone, statues, of, sixteen, oxen, in, their, upper, arcades, said, to, honour, the, animals, who, hauled, the, stone, during, the, cathedral, s, construction, in, normandy, cathedrals, and, major, churches, often, had, multiple, towers, built, over, the, centuries, the, abbaye, aux, hommes, begun, 1066, caen, has, nine, towers, and, spires, placed, on, the, fa, ade, the, transepts, and, the, centre, a, lantern, tower, was, often, placed, the, centre, of, the, nave, at, the, meeting, point, with, the, transept, to, give, light, to, the, church, below, in, later, periods, of, gothic, pointed, needle, like, spires, were, often, added, to, the, towers, giving, them, much, greater, height, a, variation, of, the, spire, was, the, fl, che, a, slender, spear, like, spire, which, was, usually, placed, on, the, transept, where, it, crossed, the, nave, they, were, often, made, of, wood, covered, with, lead, or, other, metal, they, sometimes, had, open, frames, and, were, decorated, with, sculpture, amiens, cathedral, has, a, fl, che, the, most, famous, example, was, that, of, notre, dame, de, paris, the, original, fl, che, of, notre, dame, was, built, on, the, crossing, of, the, transept, in, the, middle, of, the, 13th, century, and, housed, five, bells, it, was, removed, in, 1786, during, a, program, to, modernize, the, cathedral, but, was, put, back, in, a, new, form, designed, by, eug, ne, viollet, le, duc, the, new, fl, che, of, wood, covered, with, lead, was, decorated, with, statues, of, the, apostles, the, figure, of, st, thomas, resembled, viollet, le, duc, the, fl, che, was, destroyed, in, the, 2019, fire, but, is, being, restored, in, the, same, design, in, english, gothic, the, major, tower, was, often, placed, at, the, crossing, of, the, transept, and, nave, and, was, much, higher, than, the, other, the, most, famous, example, is, the, tower, of, salisbury, cathedral, completed, in, 1320, by, william, of, farleigh, it, was, a, remarkable, feat, of, construction, since, it, was, built, upon, the, pillars, of, the, much, earlier, church, a, crossing, tower, was, constructed, at, canterbury, cathedral, in, 1493, 1501, by, john, wastell, who, had, previously, worked, on, king, s, college, at, cambridge, it, was, finished, by, henry, yevele, who, also, built, the, present, nave, of, canterbury, the, new, central, tower, at, wells, cathedral, caused, a, problem, it, was, too, heavy, for, the, original, structure, an, unusual, double, arch, had, to, be, constructed, in, the, centre, of, the, crossing, to, give, the, tower, the, extra, support, it, needed, england, s, gothic, parish, churches, and, collegiate, churches, generally, have, a, single, western, tower, a, number, of, the, finest, churches, have, masonry, spires, with, those, of, st, james, church, louth, st, wulfram, s, church, grantham, st, mary, redcliffe, in, bristol, and, coventry, cathedral, these, spires, all, exceed, 85, m, 280, ft, in, height, westminster, abbey, s, crossing, tower, has, for, centuries, remained, unbuilt, and, numerous, architects, have, proposed, various, ways, of, completing, it, since, the, 1250s, when, work, began, on, the, tower, under, henry, iii, a, century, and, half, later, an, octagonal, roof, lantern, resembling, that, of, ely, cathedral, was, installed, instead, which, was, then, demolished, in, the, 16th, century, construction, began, again, in, 1724, to, the, design, of, nicholas, hawksmoor, after, first, christopher, wren, had, proposed, a, design, in, 1710, but, stopped, again, in, 1727, the, crossing, remains, covered, by, the, stub, of, the, lantern, and, a, temporary, roof, later, gothic, towers, in, central, europe, often, followed, the, french, model, but, added, even, denser, decorative, tracery, cologne, cathedral, had, been, started, in, the, 13th, century, following, the, plan, of, amiens, cathedral, but, only, the, apse, and, the, base, of, one, tower, were, finished, in, the, gothic, period, the, original, plans, were, conserved, and, rediscovered, in, 1817, and, the, building, was, completed, in, the, 19th, century, following, the, origin, design, it, has, two, spectacularly, ornamented, towers, covered, with, arches, gables, pinnacles, and, openwork, spires, pointing, upwards, the, tower, of, ulm, minster, has, a, similar, history, begun, in, 1377, stopped, in, 1543, and, not, completed, until, the, 19th, century, regional, variants, of, gothic, towers, appeared, in, spain, and, italy, burgos, cathedral, was, inspired, by, northern, europe, it, has, an, exceptional, cluster, of, openwork, spires, towers, and, pinnacles, drenched, with, ornament, it, was, begun, in, 1444, by, a, german, architect, juan, de, colonia, john, of, cologne, and, eventually, completed, by, a, central, tower, 1540, built, by, his, grandson, in, italy, the, towers, were, sometimes, separate, from, the, cathedral, and, the, architects, usually, kept, their, distance, from, the, northern, european, style, the, leaning, tower, of, pisa, cathedral, built, between, 1173, and, 1372, is, the, best, known, example, the, campanile, of, florence, cathedral, was, built, by, giotto, in, the, florentine, gothic, style, decorated, with, encrustations, of, polychrome, marble, it, was, originally, designed, to, have, a, spire, tracery, is, an, architectural, solution, by, which, windows, or, screens, panels, and, vaults, are, divided, into, sections, of, various, proportions, by, stone, bars, or, ribs, of, moulding, pointed, arch, windows, of, gothic, buildings, were, initially, late, 12th, late, 13th, centuries, lancet, windows, a, solution, typical, of, the, early, gothic, or, first, pointed, style, and, of, the, early, english, gothic, plate, tracery, was, the, first, type, of, tracery, to, be, developed, emerging, in, the, later, phase, of, early, gothic, or, first, pointed, second, pointed, is, distinguished, from, first, by, the, appearance, of, bar, tracery, allowing, the, construction, of, much, larger, window, openings, and, the, development, of, curvilinear, flowing, and, reticulated, tracery, ultimately, contributing, to, the, flamboyant, style, late, gothic, in, most, of, europe, saw, tracery, patterns, resembling, lace, develop, while, in, england, perpendicular, gothic, or, third, pointed, preferred, plainer, vertical, mullions, and, transoms, tracery, is, practical, as, well, as, decorative, because, the, increasingly, large, windows, of, gothic, buildings, needed, maximum, support, against, the, wind, plate, tracery, in, which, lights, were, pierced, in, a, thin, wall, of, ashlar, allowed, a, window, arch, to, have, more, than, one, light, typically, two, side, by, side, and, separated, by, flat, stone, spandrels, the, spandrels, were, then, sculpted, into, figures, like, a, roundel, or, a, quatrefoil, plate, tracery, reached, the, height, of, its, sophistication, with, the, 12th, century, windows, of, chartres, cathedral, and, in, the, dean, s, eye, rose, window, at, lincoln, cathedral, at, the, beginning, of, the, 13th, century, plate, tracery, was, superseded, by, bar, tracery, bar, tracery, divides, the, large, lights, from, one, another, with, moulded, mullions, stone, bar, tracery, an, important, decorative, element, of, gothic, styles, first, was, used, at, reims, cathedral, shortly, after, 1211, in, the, chevet, built, by, jean, d, orbais, it, was, employed, in, england, around, 1240, after, 1220, master, builders, in, england, had, begun, to, treat, the, window, openings, as, a, series, of, openings, divided, by, thin, stone, bars, while, before, 1230, the, apse, chapels, of, reims, cathedral, were, decorated, with, bar, tracery, with, cusped, circles, with, bars, radiating, from, the, centre, bar, tracery, became, common, after, c, 1240, with, increasing, complexity, and, decreasing, weight, the, lines, of, the, mullions, continued, beyond, the, tops, of, the, window, lights, and, subdivided, the, open, spandrels, above, the, lights, into, a, variety, of, decorative, shapes, rayonnant, style, c, 1230, c, 1350, was, enabled, by, the, development, of, bar, tracery, in, continental, europe, and, is, named, for, the, radiation, of, lights, around, a, central, point, in, circular, rose, windows, rayonnant, also, deployed, mouldings, of, two, different, types, in, tracery, where, earlier, styles, had, used, moulding, of, a, single, size, with, different, sizes, of, mullions, the, rose, windows, of, notre, dame, de, paris, c, 1270, are, typical, the, early, phase, of, middle, pointed, style, late, 13th, century, is, characterized, by, geometrical, tracery, simple, bar, tracery, forming, patterns, of, foiled, arches, and, circles, interspersed, with, triangular, lights, the, mullions, of, geometrical, style, typically, had, capitals, with, curved, bars, emerging, from, them, intersecting, bar, tracery, c, 1300, deployed, mullions, without, capitals, which, branched, off, equidistant, to, the, window, head, the, window, heads, themselves, were, formed, of, equal, curves, forming, a, pointed, arch, and, the, tracery, bars, were, curved, by, drawing, curves, with, differing, radii, from, the, same, centres, as, the, window, heads, the, mullions, were, in, consequence, branched, into, y, shaped, designs, further, ornamented, with, cusps, the, intersecting, branches, produced, an, array, of, lozenge, shaped, lights, in, between, numerous, lancet, arched, lights, y, tracery, was, often, employed, in, two, light, windows, c, 1300, second, pointed, 14th, century, saw, intersecting, tracery, elaborated, with, ogees, creating, a, complex, reticular, net, like, design, known, as, reticulated, tracery, second, pointed, architecture, deployed, tracery, in, highly, decorated, fashion, known, as, curvilinear, and, flowing, undulating, these, types, of, bar, tracery, were, developed, further, throughout, europe, in, the, 15th, century, into, the, flamboyant, style, named, for, the, characteristic, flame, shaped, spaces, between, the, tracery, bars, these, shapes, are, known, as, daggers, fish, bladders, or, mouchettes, third, pointed, or, perpendicular, gothic, developed, in, england, from, the, later, 14th, century, and, is, typified, by, rectilinear, tracery, panel, tracery, the, mullions, are, often, joined, together, by, transoms, and, continue, up, their, straight, vertical, lines, to, the, top, of, the, window, s, main, arch, some, branching, off, into, lesser, arches, and, creating, a, series, of, panel, like, lights, perpendicular, strove, for, verticality, and, dispensed, with, the, curvilinear, style, s, sinuous, lines, in, favour, of, unbroken, straight, mullions, from, top, to, bottom, transected, by, horizontal, transoms, and, bars, four, centred, arches, were, used, in, the, 15th, and, 16th, centuries, to, create, windows, of, increasing, size, with, flatter, window, heads, often, filling, the, entire, wall, of, the, bay, between, each, buttress, the, windows, were, themselves, divided, into, panels, of, lights, topped, by, pointed, arches, struck, from, four, centres, the, transoms, were, often, topped, by, miniature, crenellations, the, windows, at, cambridge, of, king, s, college, chapel, 1446, 1515, represent, the, heights, of, perpendicular, tracery, tracery, was, used, on, both, the, interior, and, exterior, of, buildings, it, frequently, covered, the, fa, ades, and, the, interior, walls, of, the, nave, and, choir, were, covered, with, blind, arcades, it, also, often, picked, up, and, repeated, the, designs, in, the, stained, glass, windows, strasbourg, cathedral, has, a, west, front, lavishly, ornamented, with, bar, tracery, matching, the, windows, the, plan, of, gothic, cathedrals, and, churches, was, usually, based, on, the, latin, cross, or, cruciform, plan, taken, from, the, ancient, roman, basilica, and, from, the, later, romanesque, churches, they, have, a, long, nave, making, the, body, of, the, church, where, the, parishioners, worshipped, a, transverse, arm, called, the, transept, and, beyond, it, to, the, east, the, choir, also, known, as, a, chancel, or, presbytery, that, was, usually, reserved, for, the, clergy, the, eastern, end, of, the, church, was, rounded, in, french, churches, and, was, occupied, by, several, radiating, chapels, which, allowed, multiple, ceremonies, to, go, on, simultaneously, in, english, churches, the, eastern, end, also, had, chapels, but, was, usually, rectangular, a, passage, called, the, ambulatory, circled, the, choir, this, allowed, parishioners, and, especially, pilgrims, to, walk, past, the, chapels, to, see, the, relics, displayed, there, without, disturbing, other, services, going, on, each, vault, of, the, nave, formed, a, separate, cell, with, its, own, supporting, piers, or, columns, the, early, cathedrals, like, notre, dame, had, six, part, rib, vaults, with, alternating, columns, and, piers, while, later, cathedrals, had, the, simpler, and, stronger, four, part, vaults, with, identical, columns, following, the, model, of, romanesque, architecture, and, the, basilica, of, saint, denis, cathedrals, usually, had, two, towers, flanking, the, west, fa, ade, towers, over, the, crossing, were, common, in, england, salisbury, cathedral, york, minister, but, rarer, in, france, transepts, were, usually, short, in, early, french, gothic, architecture, but, became, longer, and, were, given, large, rose, windows, in, the, rayonnant, period, the, choirs, became, more, important, the, choir, was, often, flanked, by, a, double, disambulatory, which, was, crowned, by, a, ring, of, small, chapels, in, england, transepts, were, more, important, and, the, floor, plans, were, usually, much, more, complex, than, in, french, cathedrals, with, the, addition, of, attached, lady, chapels, an, octagonal, chapter, house, and, other, structures, see, plans, of, salisbury, cathedral, and, york, minster, below, this, reflected, a, tendency, in, france, to, carry, out, multiple, functions, in, the, same, space, while, english, cathedrals, compartmentalized, them, this, contrast, is, visible, in, the, difference, between, amiens, cathedral, with, its, minimal, transepts, and, semicircular, apse, filled, with, chapels, on, the, east, end, compared, with, the, double, transepts, projecting, north, porch, and, rectangular, east, end, of, salisbury, and, york, gothic, architecture, was, a, continual, search, for, greater, height, thinner, walls, and, more, light, this, was, clearly, illustrated, in, the, evolving, elevations, of, the, cathedrals, in, early, gothic, architecture, following, the, model, of, the, romanesque, churches, the, buildings, had, thick, solid, walls, with, a, minimum, of, windows, in, order, to, give, enough, support, for, the, vaulted, roofs, an, elevation, typically, had, four, levels, on, the, ground, floor, was, an, arcade, with, massive, piers, alternating, with, thinner, columns, which, supported, the, six, part, rib, vaults, above, that, was, a, gallery, called, the, tribune, which, provided, stability, to, the, walls, and, was, sometimes, used, to, provide, seating, for, the, nuns, above, that, was, a, narrower, gallery, called, the, triforium, which, also, helped, provide, additional, thickness, and, support, at, the, top, just, beneath, the, vaults, was, the, clerestory, where, the, high, windows, were, placed, the, upper, level, was, supported, from, the, outside, by, the, flying, buttresses, this, system, was, used, at, noyon, cathedral, sens, cathedral, and, other, early, structures, in, the, high, gothic, period, thanks, to, the, introduction, of, the, four, part, rib, vault, a, simplified, elevation, appeared, at, chartres, cathedral, and, others, the, alternating, piers, and, columns, on, the, ground, floor, were, replaced, by, rows, of, identical, circular, piers, wrapped, in, four, engaged, columns, the, tribune, disappeared, which, meant, that, the, arcades, could, be, higher, this, created, more, space, at, the, top, for, the, upper, windows, which, were, expanded, to, include, a, smaller, circular, window, above, a, group, of, lancet, windows, the, new, walls, gave, a, stronger, sense, of, verticality, and, brought, in, more, light, a, similar, arrangement, was, adapted, in, england, at, salisbury, cathedral, lincoln, cathedral, and, ely, cathedral, an, important, characteristic, of, gothic, church, architecture, is, its, height, both, absolute, and, in, proportion, to, its, width, the, verticality, suggesting, an, aspiration, to, heaven, the, increasing, height, of, cathedrals, over, the, gothic, period, was, accompanied, by, an, increasing, proportion, of, the, wall, devoted, to, windows, until, by, the, late, gothic, the, interiors, became, like, cages, of, glass, this, was, made, possible, by, the, development, of, the, flying, buttress, which, transferred, the, thrust, of, the, weight, of, the, roof, to, the, supports, outside, the, walls, as, a, result, the, walls, gradually, became, thinner, and, higher, and, masonry, was, replaced, with, glass, the, four, part, elevation, of, the, naves, of, early, cathedrals, such, as, notre, dame, arcade, tribune, triforium, clerestory, was, transformed, in, the, choir, of, beauvais, cathedral, to, very, tall, arcades, a, thin, triforium, and, soaring, windows, up, to, the, roof, beauvais, cathedral, reached, the, limit, of, what, was, possible, with, gothic, technology, a, portion, of, the, choir, collapsed, in, 1284, causing, alarm, in, all, of, the, cities, with, very, tall, cathedrals, panels, of, experts, were, created, in, sienna, and, chartres, to, study, the, stability, of, those, structures, only, the, transept, and, choir, of, beauvais, were, completed, and, in, the, 21st, century, the, transept, walls, were, reinforced, with, cross, beams, no, cathedral, built, since, exceeded, the, height, of, the, choir, of, beauvais, churches, traditionally, face, east, with, the, altar, at, the, east, and, the, west, front, or, fa, ade, was, considered, the, most, important, entrance, gothic, fa, ades, were, adapted, from, the, model, of, the, romanesque, fa, ades, the, fa, ades, usually, had, three, portals, or, doorways, leading, into, the, nave, over, each, doorway, was, a, tympanum, a, work, of, sculpture, crowded, with, figures, the, sculpture, of, the, central, tympanum, was, devoted, to, the, last, judgement, that, to, the, left, to, the, virgin, mary, and, that, to, the, right, to, the, saints, honoured, at, that, particular, cathedral, in, the, early, gothic, the, columns, of, the, doorways, took, the, form, of, statues, of, saints, making, them, literally, pillars, of, the, church, in, the, early, gothic, the, fa, ades, were, characterized, by, height, elegance, harmony, unity, and, a, balance, of, proportions, they, followed, the, doctrine, expressed, by, saint, thomas, aquinas, that, beauty, was, a, harmony, of, contrasts, following, the, model, of, saint, denis, and, later, notre, dame, de, paris, the, fa, ade, was, flanked, by, two, towers, proportional, to, the, rest, of, the, fa, ade, which, balanced, the, horizontal, and, vertical, elements, early, gothic, fa, ades, often, had, a, small, rose, window, placed, above, the, central, portal, in, england, the, rose, window, was, often, replaced, by, several, lancet, windows, in, the, high, gothic, period, the, fa, ades, grew, higher, and, had, more, dramatic, architecture, and, sculpture, at, amiens, cathedral, c, 1220, the, porches, were, deeper, the, niches, and, pinnacles, were, more, prominent, the, portals, were, crowned, with, high, arched, gables, composed, of, concentric, arches, filled, with, sculpture, the, rose, windows, became, enormous, filling, an, entirely, wall, above, the, central, portal, and, they, were, themselves, covered, with, a, large, pointed, arch, the, rose, windows, were, pushed, upwards, by, the, growing, profusion, of, decoration, below, the, towers, were, adorned, with, their, own, arches, often, crowned, with, pinnacles, the, towers, themselves, were, crowned, with, spires, often, of, open, work, sculpture, one, of, the, finest, examples, of, a, flamboyant, fa, ade, is, notre, dame, de, l, pine, 1405, 1527, while, french, cathedrals, emphasized, the, height, of, the, fa, ade, english, cathedrals, particularly, in, earlier, gothic, often, emphasized, the, width, the, west, front, of, wells, cathedral, is, 146, feet, across, compared, with, 116, feet, wide, at, the, nearly, contemporary, amiens, cathedral, though, amiens, is, twice, as, high, the, west, front, of, wells, was, almost, entirely, covered, with, statuary, like, amiens, and, was, given, even, further, emphasis, by, its, colors, traces, of, blue, scarlet, and, gold, are, found, on, the, sculpture, as, well, as, painted, stars, against, the, dark, background, on, other, sections, italian, gothic, fa, ades, have, the, three, traditional, portals, and, rose, windows, or, sometimes, simply, a, large, circular, window, without, tracery, plus, an, abundance, of, flamboyant, elements, including, sculpture, pinnacles, and, spires, however, they, added, distinctive, italian, elements, as, seen, in, the, fa, ades, of, siena, cathedral, and, of, orvieto, cathedral, the, orvieto, fa, ade, was, largely, the, work, of, a, master, mason, lorenzo, maitani, who, worked, on, the, fa, ade, from, 1308, until, his, death, in, 1330, he, broke, away, from, the, french, emphasis, on, height, and, eliminated, the, column, statutes, and, statuary, in, the, arched, entries, and, covered, the, fa, ade, with, colourful, mosaics, of, biblical, scenes, the, current, mosaics, are, of, a, later, date, he, also, added, sculpture, in, relief, on, the, supporting, contreforts, another, important, feature, of, the, italian, gothic, portal, was, the, sculpted, bronze, door, the, sculptor, andrea, pisano, made, the, celebrated, bronze, doors, for, florence, baptistry, 1330, 1336, they, were, not, the, first, abbot, suger, had, commissioned, bronze, doors, for, saint, denis, in, 1140, but, they, were, replaced, with, wooden, doors, when, the, abbey, was, enlarged, pisano, s, work, with, its, realism, and, emotion, pointed, toward, the, coming, renaissance, cathedrals, and, churches, were, traditionally, constructed, with, the, altar, at, the, east, end, so, that, the, priest, and, congregation, faced, the, rising, sun, during, the, morning, liturgy, the, sun, was, considered, the, symbol, of, christ, and, the, second, coming, a, major, theme, in, cathedral, sculpture, the, portion, of, the, church, east, of, altar, is, the, choir, reserved, for, members, of, the, clergy, there, is, usually, a, single, or, double, ambulatory, or, aisle, around, the, choir, and, east, end, so, parishioners, and, pilgrims, could, walk, freely, easily, around, east, end, in, romanesque, churches, the, east, end, was, very, dark, due, to, the, thick, walls, and, small, windows, in, the, ambulatory, of, the, basilica, of, saint, denis, abbot, suger, first, used, the, novel, combination, rib, vaults, and, buttresses, to, replace, the, thick, walls, and, replace, them, with, stained, glass, opening, up, that, portion, of, the, church, to, what, he, considered, divine, light, in, french, gothic, churches, the, east, end, or, chevet, often, had, an, apse, a, semi, circular, projection, with, a, vaulted, or, domed, roof, the, chevet, of, large, cathedrals, frequently, had, a, ring, of, radiating, chapels, placed, between, the, buttresses, to, get, maximum, light, there, are, three, such, chapels, at, chartres, cathedral, seven, at, notre, dame, de, paris, amiens, cathedral, prague, cathedral, and, cologne, cathedral, and, nine, at, basilica, of, saint, anthony, of, padua, in, italy, in, england, the, east, end, is, more, often, rectangular, and, gives, access, to, a, separate, and, large, lady, chapel, dedicated, to, the, virgin, mary, lady, chapels, were, also, common, in, italy, sculpture, was, an, important, element, of, gothic, architecture, its, intent, was, present, the, stories, of, the, bible, in, vivid, and, understandable, fashion, to, the, great, majority, of, the, faithful, who, could, not, read, the, iconography, of, the, sculptural, decoration, on, the, fa, ade, was, not, left, to, the, sculptors, an, edict, of, the, second, council, of, nicaea, in, 787, had, declared, the, composition, of, religious, images, is, not, to, be, left, to, the, inspiration, of, artists, it, is, derived, from, the, principles, put, in, place, by, the, catholic, church, and, religious, tradition, only, the, art, belongs, to, the, artist, the, composition, belongs, to, the, fathers, in, early, gothic, churches, following, the, romanesque, tradition, sculpture, appeared, on, the, fa, ade, or, west, front, in, the, triangular, tympanum, over, the, central, portal, gradually, as, the, style, evolved, the, sculpture, became, more, and, more, prominent, taking, over, the, columns, of, the, portal, and, gradually, climbing, above, the, portals, until, statues, in, niches, covered, the, entire, fa, ade, as, in, wells, cathedral, to, the, transepts, and, as, at, amiens, cathedral, even, on, the, interior, of, the, fa, ade, some, of, the, earliest, examples, are, found, at, chartres, cathedral, where, the, three, portals, of, the, west, front, illustrate, the, three, epiphanies, in, the, life, of, christ, at, amiens, the, tympanum, over, the, central, portal, depicted, the, last, judgement, the, right, portal, showed, the, coronation, of, the, virgin, and, the, left, portal, showed, the, lives, of, saints, who, were, important, in, the, diocese, this, set, a, pattern, of, complex, iconography, which, was, followed, at, other, churches, the, columns, below, the, tympanum, are, in, the, form, of, statues, of, saints, literally, representing, them, as, the, pillars, of, the, church, each, saint, had, his, own, symbol, at, his, feet, so, viewers, could, recognize, them, a, winged, lion, meant, saint, mark, an, eagle, with, four, wings, meant, saint, john, the, apostle, and, a, winged, bull, symbolized, saint, luke, floral, and, vegetal, decoration, was, also, very, common, representing, the, garden, of, eden, grapes, represented, the, wines, of, eucharist, the, tympanum, over, the, central, portal, on, the, west, fa, ade, of, notre, dame, de, paris, vividly, illustrates, the, last, judgement, with, figures, of, sinners, being, led, off, to, hell, and, good, christians, taken, to, heaven, the, sculpture, of, the, right, portal, shows, the, coronation, of, the, virgin, mary, and, the, left, portal, shows, the, lives, of, saints, who, were, important, to, parisians, particularly, saint, anne, the, mother, of, the, virgin, mary, to, make, the, message, even, more, prominent, the, sculpture, of, the, tympanum, was, painted, in, bright, colors, following, a, system, of, colours, codified, in, the, 12th, century, yellow, called, gold, symbolized, intelligence, grandeur, and, virtue, white, called, argent, symbolized, purity, wisdom, and, correctness, black, or, sable, meant, sadness, but, also, will, green, or, sinople, represented, hope, liberty, and, joy, red, or, gueules, see, gules, meant, charity, or, victory, blue, or, azure, symbolised, the, sky, faithfulness, and, perseverance, and, violet, or, pourpre, was, the, colour, of, royalty, and, sovereignty, in, the, later, gothic, the, sculpture, became, more, naturalistic, the, figures, were, separated, from, the, walls, and, had, much, more, expressive, faces, showing, emotion, and, personality, the, drapery, was, very, skilfully, carved, the, torments, of, hell, were, even, more, vividly, depicted, the, late, gothic, sculpture, at, siena, cathedral, by, nino, pisano, pointing, toward, the, renaissance, is, particularly, notable, much, of, it, is, now, kept, in, a, museum, to, protect, it, from, deterioration, besides, saints, and, apostles, the, exteriors, of, gothic, churches, were, also, decorated, with, sculptures, of, a, variety, of, fabulous, and, frightening, grotesques, or, monsters, these, included, the, chimera, a, mythical, hybrid, creature, which, usually, had, the, body, of, a, lion, and, the, head, of, a, goat, and, the, strix, or, stryge, a, creature, resembling, an, owl, or, bat, which, was, said, to, eat, human, flesh, the, strix, appeared, in, classical, roman, literature, it, was, described, by, the, roman, poet, ovid, who, was, widely, read, in, the, middle, ages, as, a, large, headed, bird, with, transfixed, eyes, rapacious, beak, and, greyish, white, wings, they, were, part, of, the, visual, message, for, the, illiterate, worshippers, symbols, of, the, evil, and, danger, that, threatened, those, who, did, not, follow, the, teachings, of, the, church, the, gargoyles, which, were, added, to, notre, dame, in, about, 1240, had, a, more, practical, purpose, they, were, the, rain, spouts, of, the, church, designed, to, divide, the, torrent, of, water, which, poured, from, the, roof, after, rain, and, to, project, it, outwards, as, far, as, possible, from, the, buttresses, and, the, walls, and, windows, so, that, it, would, not, erode, the, mortar, binding, the, stone, to, produce, many, thin, streams, rather, than, a, torrent, of, water, a, large, number, of, gargoyles, were, used, so, they, were, also, designed, to, be, a, decorative, element, of, the, architecture, the, rainwater, ran, from, the, roof, into, lead, gutters, then, down, channels, on, the, flying, buttresses, then, along, a, channel, cut, in, the, back, of, the, gargoyle, and, out, of, the, mouth, away, from, the, church, many, of, the, statues, at, notre, dame, particularly, the, grotesques, were, removed, from, the, fa, ade, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, century, or, were, destroyed, during, the, french, revolution, they, were, replaced, with, figures, in, the, gothic, style, designed, by, eug, ne, viollet, le, duc, during, the, 19th, century, restoration, similar, figures, appear, on, the, other, major, gothic, churches, of, france, and, england, another, common, feature, of, gothic, cathedrals, in, france, was, a, labyrinth, or, maze, on, the, floor, of, the, nave, near, the, choir, which, symbolised, the, difficult, and, often, complicated, journey, of, a, christian, life, before, attaining, paradise, most, labyrinths, were, removed, by, the, 18th, century, but, a, few, like, the, one, at, amiens, cathedral, have, been, reconstructed, and, the, labyrinth, at, chartres, cathedral, still, exists, essentially, in, its, original, form, increasing, the, amount, of, light, in, the, interior, was, a, primary, objective, of, the, founders, of, the, gothic, movement, abbot, suger, described, the, new, kind, of, architecture, he, had, created, in, the, east, end, of, the, saint, denis, a, circular, ring, of, chapels, by, virtue, of, which, the, whole, church, would, shine, with, the, wonderful, and, uninterrupted, light, of, most, luminous, windows, pervading, the, interior, beauty, religious, teachings, in, the, middle, ages, particularly, the, writings, of, pseudo, dionysius, the, areopagite, a, 6th, century, mystic, whose, book, de, coelesti, hierarchia, was, popular, among, monks, in, france, taught, that, all, light, was, divine, when, the, abbot, suger, ordered, the, reconstruction, of, choir, of, the, abbey, church, at, saint, denis, he, had, the, builders, create, seventy, windows, admitting, as, much, light, as, possible, as, the, means, by, which, the, faithful, could, be, elevated, from, the, material, world, to, the, immaterial, world, the, placement, of, the, windows, was, also, determined, by, religious, doctrine, the, windows, on, the, north, side, frequently, in, the, shade, had, windows, depicting, the, old, testament, the, windows, of, the, east, corresponding, to, the, direction, of, the, sunrise, had, images, of, christ, and, scenes, from, the, new, testament, in, the, early, gothic, period, the, glass, was, particularly, thick, and, was, deeply, coloured, with, metal, oxides, cobalt, for, blue, copper, for, a, ruby, red, iron, for, green, and, antimony, for, yellow, the, process, of, making, the, windows, was, described, in, detail, by, the, 12th, century, monk, known, as, theophilus, presbyter, the, glass, of, each, colour, was, melted, with, the, oxide, blown, shaped, into, small, sheets, cracked, with, a, hot, iron, into, small, pieces, and, assembled, on, a, large, table, the, details, were, painted, onto, the, glass, in, vitreous, enamel, then, baked, in, a, kiln, to, fuse, the, enamel, on, the, glass, the, pieces, were, fit, into, a, framework, of, thin, lead, strips, and, then, put, into, a, more, solid, frame, or, iron, armatures, between, the, panels, the, finished, window, was, set, into, the, stone, opening, thin, vertical, and, horizontal, bars, of, iron, called, vergettes, or, barlotierres, were, placed, inside, the, window, to, reinforce, the, glass, against, the, wind, the, use, of, iron, rods, between, the, panels, of, glass, and, a, framework, of, stone, mullions, or, ribs, made, it, possible, to, create, much, larger, windows, the, three, rose, windows, at, chartres, 1203, 1240, each, were, more, than, 12, m, 40, ft, in, diameter, larger, windows, also, appeared, at, york, minster, 1140, 1160, and, canterbury, cathedral, 1178, 1200, the, stained, glass, windows, were, extremely, complex, and, expensive, to, create, king, louis, ix, paid, for, the, rose, windows, in, the, transept, of, notre, dame, de, paris, but, other, windows, were, financed, by, the, contributions, of, the, professions, or, guilds, of, the, city, these, windows, usually, had, a, panel, which, illustrated, the, work, of, the, guild, which, funded, it, such, as, the, drapers, stonemasons, or, coopers, the, 13th, century, saw, the, introduction, of, a, new, kind, of, window, with, grisaille, or, white, glass, with, a, geometric, pattern, usually, joined, with, medallions, of, stained, glass, these, windows, allowed, much, more, light, into, the, cathedral, but, diminished, the, vividness, of, the, stained, glass, since, there, was, less, contrast, between, the, dark, interior, and, bright, exterior, the, most, remarkable, and, influential, work, of, stained, glass, in, the, 13th, century, was, the, royal, chapel, sainte, chapelle, 1243, 1248, where, the, windows, of, the, upper, chapel, 15, m, 49, ft, high, occupied, all, of, the, walls, on, the, three, sides, with, 1, 134, individual, scenes, sainte, chapelle, became, the, model, for, other, chapels, across, europe, the, 14th, century, brought, a, variety, of, new, colours, and, the, use, of, more, realistic, shading, and, half, toning, this, was, done, by, the, development, of, flashed, glass, clear, glass, was, dipped, into, coloured, glass, then, portions, of, the, coloured, glass, were, ground, away, to, give, exactly, the, right, shade, in, the, 15th, century, artists, began, painting, directly, onto, the, glass, with, enamel, colours, gradually, the, art, of, glass, came, closer, and, closer, to, traditional, painting, one, of, the, most, celebrated, flamboyant, buildings, was, the, sainte, chapelle, de, vincennes, 1370s, with, walls, of, glass, from, floor, to, ceiling, the, original, glass, was, destroyed, and, is, replaced, by, grisaille, glass, king, s, college, chapel, 15th, century, also, followed, the, model, of, walls, entirely, filled, with, glass, the, stained, glass, windows, were, extremely, complex, and, expensive, to, create, king, louis, ix, paid, for, the, rose, windows, in, the, transept, of, notre, dame, de, paris, while, other, windows, were, often, financed, by, the, contributions, of, the, professions, or, guilds, of, the, city, these, windows, usually, incorporated, a, panel, which, illustrates, the, work, of, the, guild, which, funded, it, such, as, the, drapers, stonemasons, or, barrel, makers, in, england, the, stained, glass, windows, also, grew, in, size, and, importance, major, examples, were, the, becket, windows, at, canterbury, cathedral, 1200, 1230, and, the, windows, of, lincoln, cathedral, 1200, 1220, enormous, windows, were, also, an, important, element, of, york, minster, and, gloucester, cathedral, much, of, the, stained, glass, in, gothic, churches, today, dates, from, later, restorations, but, a, few, notably, chartres, cathedral, and, bourges, cathedral, still, have, many, of, their, original, windows, rose, windows, were, a, prominent, feature, of, many, gothic, churches, and, cathedrals, the, rose, was, a, symbol, of, the, virgin, mary, and, they, were, particularly, used, in, churches, dedicated, to, her, the, french, gothic, cathedrals, of, chartres, notre, dame, de, paris, reims, and, laon, have, them, in, the, west, fa, ade, and, in, the, transepts, as, well, amiens, cathedral, strasbourg, cathedral, and, westminster, abbey, also, have, them, in, transepts, the, designs, of, their, tracery, became, increasingly, complex, and, gave, their, names, to, two, periods, the, rayonnant, and, the, flamboyant, two, of, the, most, famous, rayonnant, rose, windows, were, constructed, in, the, transepts, of, notre, dame, in, the, 13th, century, the, gothic, style, was, used, in, royal, and, papal, residences, as, well, as, in, churches, prominent, examples, include, the, palais, de, la, cit, the, medieval, louvre, the, chateau, de, vincennes, in, paris, residences, of, the, french, kings, the, doge, s, palace, in, venice, and, the, palace, of, the, kings, of, navarre, in, olite, 1269, 1512, another, is, the, palais, des, papes, palace, of, the, popes, the, former, papal, residence, in, avignon, it, was, constructed, between, 1252, and, 1364, during, the, avignon, papacy, given, the, complicated, political, situation, it, combined, the, functions, of, a, church, a, seat, of, government, and, a, fortress, the, palais, de, la, cit, in, paris, close, to, notre, dame, de, paris, begun, in, 1119, which, was, the, principal, residence, of, the, french, kings, until, 1417, most, of, the, palais, de, la, cit, is, gone, but, two, of, the, original, towers, along, the, seine, of, the, towers, the, vaulted, ceilings, of, the, hall, of, the, men, at, arms, 1302, now, in, the, conciergerie, and, the, original, chapel, sainte, chapelle, can, still, be, seen, the, louvre, palace, was, originally, built, by, philippe, ii, of, france, beginning, in, 1190, to, house, the, king, s, archives, and, treasures, and, given, machicoulis, and, features, of, a, gothic, fortress, however, it, was, soon, made, obsolete, by, the, development, of, artillery, and, in, the, 15th, century, it, was, remodelled, into, a, comfortable, residential, palace, while, the, outer, walls, retained, their, original, military, appearance, the, castle, itself, with, a, profusion, of, spires, towers, pinnacles, arches, and, gables, became, a, visible, symbol, of, royalty, and, aristocracy, the, style, was, copied, in, chateaux, and, other, aristocratic, residences, across, france, and, other, parts, of, europe, in, the, 15th, century, following, the, late, gothic, period, or, flamboyant, style, elements, of, gothic, decoration, began, to, appear, in, the, town, halls, of, northern, france, flanders, and, the, netherlands, the, rouen, courthouse, in, normandy, is, representative, of, flamboyant, gothic, in, france, the, h, tel, de, ville, of, compi, gne, has, an, imposing, gothic, bell, tower, featuring, a, spire, surrounded, by, smaller, towers, and, its, windows, are, decorated, with, ornate, accolades, or, ornamental, arches, similarly, flamboyant, town, halls, were, found, in, arras, douai, and, saint, quentin, aisne, and, in, modern, belgium, in, brussels, ghent, bruges, audenarde, mons, and, leuven, gothic, civil, architecture, in, spain, includes, the, silk, exchange, in, valencia, spain, 1482, 1548, a, major, marketplace, which, has, a, main, hall, with, twisting, columns, beneath, its, vaulted, ceiling, the, gothic, style, was, adopted, in, the, late, 13th, to, 15th, centuries, in, early, english, university, buildings, with, inspiration, coming, from, monasteries, and, manor, houses, the, oldest, existing, example, in, england, is, probably, the, mob, quad, of, merton, college, at, oxford, university, constructed, between, 1288, and, 1378, the, style, was, further, refined, by, william, of, wykeham, chancellor, of, england, and, founder, of, new, college, oxford, in, 1379, his, architect, william, wynford, designed, the, new, college, quadrangle, in, the, 1380s, which, combined, a, hall, chapel, library, and, residences, for, fellows, and, undergraduates, a, similar, kind, of, academic, cloister, was, created, at, queen, s, college, oxford, in, the, 1140s, likely, designed, by, reginald, ely, the, design, of, the, colleges, was, influenced, not, only, by, abbeys, but, also, the, design, of, english, manor, houses, of, the, 14th, and, 15th, century, such, as, haddon, hall, in, derbyshire, they, were, composed, of, rectangular, courtyards, with, covered, walkways, which, separated, the, wings, some, colleges, like, balliol, college, oxford, borrowed, a, military, style, from, gothic, castles, with, battlements, and, crenelated, walls, king, s, college, chapel, cambridge, is, one, of, the, finest, examples, of, the, late, gothic, style, it, was, built, by, king, henry, vi, who, was, displeased, by, the, excessive, decoration, of, earlier, styles, he, wrote, in, 1447, that, he, wanted, his, chapel, to, proceed, in, large, form, clean, and, substantial, setting, apart, superfluity, of, too, great, curious, works, of, entail, and, busy, moulding, the, chapel, built, between, 1508, and, 1515, has, glass, walls, from, floor, to, ceiling, rising, to, spreading, fan, vaults, designed, by, john, wastell, the, glass, walls, are, supported, by, large, external, buttresses, concealed, at, the, base, by, side, chapels, other, european, examples, include, collegio, di, spagna, in, the, university, of, bologna, built, during, the, 14th, and, 15th, centuries, the, collegium, carolinum, of, the, charles, university, in, prague, in, the, czech, republic, c, 1400, the, escuelas, mayores, of, the, university, of, salamanca, in, spain, and, the, collegium, maius, of, the, jagiellonian, university, in, krak, w, poland, in, the, 13th, century, the, design, of, the, castle, french, ch, teau, fort, evolved, in, response, to, contact, with, the, more, sophisticated, fortifications, of, the, byzantine, empire, and, the, islamic, world, during, the, crusades, these, new, fortifications, were, more, geometric, with, a, central, high, tower, called, a, keep, french, donjon, which, could, be, defended, even, if, the, curtain, walls, of, the, castle, were, breached, the, donjon, of, the, ch, teau, de, vincennes, begun, by, philip, vi, of, france, was, a, good, example, it, was, 52, m, 171, ft, high, and, even, though, within, the, moat, and, walls, of, the, fortress, had, its, own, separate, drawbridge, to, going, to, higher, floor, towers, usually, round, were, placed, at, the, corners, and, along, the, walls, in, the, phillipienne, castle, close, enough, together, to, support, each, other, the, walls, had, two, levels, of, walkways, on, the, inside, a, crenellated, parapet, with, merlons, and, projecting, machicolations, from, which, missiles, could, be, dropped, on, besiegers, the, upper, walls, also, had, protected, protruding, balconies, chauguettes, and, bret, ches, from, which, soldiers, could, see, what, was, happening, at, the, corners, or, on, the, ground, below, in, addition, the, towers, and, walls, were, pierced, with, arrowslits, which, sometimes, took, the, form, of, crosses, to, enable, a, wider, field, of, fire, for, archers, and, crossbowmen, castles, were, surrounded, by, a, deep, moat, spanned, by, a, single, drawbridge, the, entrance, was, also, protected, by, a, grill, of, iron, which, could, be, opened, and, closed, the, walls, at, the, bottom, were, often, sloping, and, protected, with, earthen, barriers, one, good, surviving, example, is, the, ch, teau, de, dourdan, near, nemours, after, the, end, of, the, hundred, years, war, 1337, 1453, with, improvements, in, artillery, the, castles, lost, most, of, their, military, importance, they, remained, as, symbols, of, the, rank, of, their, noble, occupants, the, narrowing, openings, in, the, walls, were, often, widened, into, the, windows, of, bedchambers, and, ceremonial, halls, the, tower, of, the, ch, teau, de, vincennes, became, a, part, time, royal, residence, until, the, palace, of, versailles, was, completed, although, christianity, played, a, dominant, role, in, the, gothic, sacred, architecture, jewish, communities, were, present, in, many, european, cities, during, the, middle, ages, and, they, also, built, their, houses, of, prayer, in, the, gothic, style, unfortunately, most, of, the, gothic, synagogues, did, not, survive, because, they, were, often, destroyed, in, connection, with, persecution, of, the, jews, e, g, in, bamberg, n, rnberg, regensburg, vienna, one, of, the, best, preserved, examples, of, a, gothic, synagogue, is, the, old, new, synagogue, in, prague, which, was, completed, around, 1270, and, never, rebuilt, there, are, a, few, mosques, in, gothic, style, they, are, latin, catholic, churches, converted, into, mosques, the, conversion, implied, compromises, since, latin, churches, are, oriented, towards, the, east, and, mosques, are, oriented, towards, mecca, romanesque, architecture, and, norman, architecture, had, a, major, influence, upon, gothic, architecture, the, plan, of, the, gothic, cathedral, was, based, upon, the, plan, of, the, ancient, roman, basilica, which, was, adopted, by, romanesque, architecture, the, latin, cross, form, with, a, nave, and, transept, choir, disambulatory, and, radiating, chapels, came, from, the, romanesque, model, the, grand, arcades, of, columns, separating, the, central, vessel, of, the, nave, from, the, collateral, aisles, the, triforium, over, the, grand, arcades, and, the, windows, high, on, the, walls, allowing, light, into, the, nave, were, all, also, adapted, from, the, romanesque, model, the, portal, with, a, tympanum, filled, with, sculpture, was, another, characteristic, romanesque, feature, as, was, the, use, of, the, buttress, to, support, the, walls, from, the, outside, gothic, architects, improved, them, by, adding, the, flying, buttress, with, high, arches, connecting, the, buttresses, to, the, upper, walls, in, the, interior, romanesque, architecture, used, the, barrel, vault, with, a, round, arch, to, cover, the, nave, and, a, groin, vault, when, two, barrel, vaults, met, at, right, angles, these, vaults, were, the, immediate, ancestors, of, the, gothic, rib, vault, one, of, the, first, use, of, the, gothic, rib, vaults, to, cover, a, nave, was, in, the, romanesque, durham, cathedral, 1093, 1104, norman, architecture, similar, to, the, romanesque, style, also, influenced, the, gothic, style, early, examples, are, found, in, lessay, abbey, in, normandy, which, also, featured, early, rib, vaults, in, the, nave, similar, to, the, gothic, vaults, cefalu, cathedral, 1131, 1267, in, sicily, built, when, sicily, was, under, norman, rule, is, another, interesting, example, it, featured, pointed, arches, and, large, gothic, rib, vaults, combined, with, ornamental, mosaic, decoration, romanesque, architecture, had, become, a, pan, european, style, and, manner, of, construction, affecting, buildings, in, countries, as, far, apart, as, ireland, and, croatia, and, sweden, and, sicily, the, same, wide, geographic, area, was, then, affected, by, the, development, of, gothic, architecture, but, the, acceptance, of, the, gothic, style, and, methods, of, construction, differed, from, place, to, place, as, did, the, expressions, of, gothic, taste, the, proximity, of, some, regions, meant, that, modern, country, borders, did, not, define, divisions, of, style, many, different, factors, like, geographical, geological, economic, social, or, political, situations, caused, the, regional, differences, in, the, great, abbey, churches, and, cathedrals, of, the, romanesque, period, that, would, often, become, even, more, apparent, in, the, gothic, for, example, studies, of, the, population, statistics, reveals, disparities, such, as, the, multitude, of, churches, abbeys, and, cathedrals, in, northern, france, while, in, more, urbanised, regions, construction, activity, of, a, similar, scale, was, reserved, to, a, few, important, cities, such, an, example, comes, from, roberto, l, pez, wherein, the, french, city, of, amiens, was, able, to, fund, its, architectural, projects, whereas, cologne, could, not, because, of, the, economic, inequality, of, the, two, this, wealth, concentrated, in, rich, monasteries, and, noble, families, would, eventually, spread, certain, italian, catalan, and, hanseatic, bankers, this, would, be, amended, when, the, economic, hardships, of, the, 13th, century, were, no, longer, felt, allowing, normandy, tuscany, flanders, and, the, southern, rhineland, to, enter, into, competition, with, france, the, pointed, arch, one, of, the, defining, attributes, of, gothic, was, earlier, featured, in, islamic, architecture, though, it, did, not, have, the, same, functions, precursor, of, pointed, arch, appeared, in, byzantine, and, sassanian, architectures, this, was, evidenced, in, early, church, building, in, syria, and, occasional, secular, structures, like, the, karamagara, bridge, in, sassanian, architecture, employed, in, palace, and, sacred, construction, these, pre, islamic, arches, were, decorative, rather, than, structural, in, their, function, the, pointed, arch, as, an, architectonic, principle, was, first, clearly, established, in, islamic, architecture, as, an, architectonic, principle, the, pointed, arch, was, entirely, alien, to, the, pre, islamic, world, use, of, the, pointed, arch, seems, to, have, taken, off, dramatically, in, islamic, architecture, it, begins, to, appear, throughout, the, islamic, world, in, close, succession, after, its, adoption, in, the, late, umayyad, or, early, abbasid, period, some, examples, are, the, al, ukhaidir, palace, 775, ad, the, abbasid, reconstruction, of, the, al, aqsa, mosque, in, 780, ad, the, ramlah, cisterns, 789, ad, the, great, mosque, of, samarra, 851, ad, and, the, mosque, of, ibn, tulun, 879, ad, in, cairo, it, also, appears, in, one, of, the, early, reconstructions, of, the, great, mosque, of, kairouan, in, tunisia, and, the, mosque, cathedral, of, c, rdoba, in, 987, ad, the, pointed, arch, had, already, been, used, in, syria, but, in, the, mosque, of, ibn, tulun, we, have, one, of, the, earliest, examples, of, its, use, on, an, extensive, scale, some, centuries, before, it, was, exploited, in, the, west, by, the, gothic, architects, a, kind, of, rib, vault, was, also, used, in, islamic, architecture, for, example, in, the, ceiling, of, the, mosque, cathedral, of, cordoba, in, cordoba, the, dome, was, supported, by, pendentives, which, connected, the, dome, to, the, arches, below, the, pendentives, were, decorated, with, ribs, unlike, the, gothic, rib, vault, the, islamic, ribs, were, purely, decorative, they, did, not, extend, outside, of, the, vault, and, they, were, not, part, of, the, structure, supporting, the, roof, the, military, and, cultural, contacts, with, the, medieval, islamic, world, including, the, norman, conquest, of, islamic, sicily, in, 1090, the, crusades, beginning, 1096, and, the, islamic, presence, in, spain, may, have, influenced, medieval, europe, s, adoption, of, the, pointed, arch, another, feature, of, gothic, architecture, a, kind, of, rib, vault, had, also, earlier, appeared, in, islamic, architecture, and, spread, to, western, europe, via, islamic, spain, and, sicily, the, early, rib, vaults, in, spain, were, used, to, support, cupolas, and, were, decorative, the, dome, of, the, mosque, cathedral, of, cordoba, was, supported, by, pendentives, rather, than, the, vault, these, were, frequently, used, in, romanesque, and, byzantine, architecture, as, in, the, dome, of, hagia, sophia, in, istanbul, which, also, was, supported, by, pendentives, the, gothic, rib, vault, among, other, features, such, as, the, flying, buttress, have, their, antecedents, in, romanesque, architecture, such, as, durham, cathedral, constructed, between, 1093, and, 1096, in, those, parts, of, the, western, mediterranean, subject, to, islamic, control, or, influence, rich, regional, variants, arose, fusing, romanesque, and, later, gothic,
