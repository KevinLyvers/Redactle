traditional, modern, indian, classical, music, is, the, classical, music, of, the, indian, subcontinent, it, is, generally, described, using, terms, like, marg, sangeet, and, shastriya, sangeet, it, has, two, major, traditions, the, north, indian, classical, music, known, as, hindustani, and, the, south, indian, expression, known, as, carnatic, these, traditions, were, not, distinct, until, about, the, 15th, century, during, the, period, of, mughal, rule, of, the, indian, subcontinent, the, traditions, separated, and, evolved, into, distinct, forms, hindustani, music, emphasizes, improvisation, and, exploration, of, all, aspects, of, a, raga, while, carnatic, performances, tend, to, be, short, composition, based, however, the, two, systems, continue, to, have, more, common, features, than, differences, another, unique, classical, music, tradition, from, the, eastern, part, of, india, is, odissi, music, which, has, evolved, over, the, last, two, thousand, years, the, roots, of, the, classical, music, of, india, are, found, in, the, vedic, literature, of, hinduism, and, the, ancient, natyashastra, the, classic, sanskrit, text, on, performing, arts, by, bharata, muni, the, 13th, century, sanskrit, text, sangeeta, ratnakara, of, sarangadeva, is, regarded, as, the, definitive, text, by, both, the, hindustani, music, and, the, carnatic, music, traditions, indian, classical, music, has, two, foundational, elements, raga, and, tala, the, raga, based, on, a, varied, repertoire, of, swara, notes, including, microtones, forms, the, fabric, of, a, deeply, intricate, melodic, structure, while, the, tala, measures, the, time, cycle, the, raga, gives, an, artist, a, palette, to, build, the, melody, from, sounds, while, the, tala, provides, them, with, a, creative, framework, for, rhythmic, improvisation, using, time, in, indian, classical, music, the, space, between, the, notes, is, often, more, important, than, the, notes, themselves, and, it, traditionally, eschews, western, classical, concepts, such, as, harmony, counterpoint, chords, or, modulation, the, root, of, music, in, ancient, india, are, found, in, the, vedic, literature, of, hinduism, the, earliest, indian, thought, combined, three, arts, syllabic, recital, vadya, melos, gita, and, dance, nrtta, as, these, fields, developed, sangeeta, became, a, distinct, genre, of, art, in, a, form, equivalent, to, contemporary, music, this, likely, occurred, before, the, time, of, y, ska, c, 500, bce, since, he, includes, these, terms, in, his, nirukta, studies, one, of, the, six, vedanga, of, ancient, indian, tradition, some, of, the, ancient, texts, of, hinduism, such, as, the, samaveda, c, 1000, bce, are, structured, entirely, to, melodic, themes, it, is, sections, of, rigveda, set, to, music, the, samaveda, is, organized, into, two, formats, one, part, is, based, on, the, musical, meter, another, by, the, aim, of, the, rituals, the, text, is, written, with, embedded, coding, where, swaras, octave, notes, are, either, shown, above, or, within, the, text, or, the, verse, is, written, into, parvans, knot, or, member, in, simple, words, this, embedded, code, of, swaras, is, like, the, skeleton, of, the, song, the, swaras, have, about, 12, different, forms, and, different, combinations, of, these, swaras, are, made, to, sit, under, the, names, of, different, ragas, the, specific, code, of, a, song, clearly, tells, us, what, combination, of, swaras, are, present, in, a, specific, song, the, lyrical, part, of, the, song, is, called, sahityam, and, sahityam, is, just, like, singing, the, swaras, altogether, but, using, the, lyrics, of, the, song, the, code, in, the, form, of, swaras, have, even, the, notation, of, which, note, to, be, sung, high, and, which, one, low, the, hymns, of, samaveda, contain, melodic, content, form, rhythm, and, metric, organization, this, structure, is, however, not, unique, or, limited, to, samaveda, the, rigveda, embeds, the, musical, meter, too, without, the, kind, of, elaboration, found, in, the, samaveda, for, example, the, gayatri, mantra, contains, three, metric, lines, of, exactly, eight, syllables, with, an, embedded, ternary, rhythm, in, the, ancient, traditions, of, hinduism, two, musical, genre, appeared, namely, gandharva, formal, composed, ceremonial, music, and, gana, informal, improvised, entertainment, music, the, gandharva, music, also, implied, celestial, divine, associations, while, the, gana, also, implied, singing, the, vedic, sanskrit, musical, tradition, had, spread, widely, in, the, indian, subcontinent, and, according, to, rowell, the, ancient, tamil, classics, make, it, abundantly, clear, that, a, cultivated, musical, tradition, existed, in, south, india, as, early, as, the, last, few, pre, christian, centuries, the, classic, sanskrit, text, natya, shastra, is, at, the, foundation, of, the, numerous, classical, music, and, dance, traditions, of, india, before, natyashastra, was, finalized, the, ancient, indian, traditions, had, classified, musical, instruments, into, four, groups, based, on, their, acoustic, principle, how, they, work, rather, than, the, material, they, are, made, of, for, example, flute, which, works, with, gracious, in, and, out, flow, of, air, these, four, categories, are, accepted, as, given, and, are, four, separate, chapters, in, the, natyashastra, one, each, on, stringed, instruments, chordophones, hollow, instruments, aerophones, solid, instruments, idiophones, and, covered, instruments, membranophones, of, these, states, levis, rowell, the, idiophone, in, the, form, of, small, bronze, cymbals, were, used, for, tala, almost, the, entire, chapter, of, natyashastra, on, idiophones, by, bharata, is, a, theoretical, treatise, on, the, system, of, tala, time, keeping, with, idiophones, was, considered, a, separate, function, than, that, of, percussion, membranophones, in, the, early, indian, thought, on, music, theory, the, early, 13th, century, sanskrit, text, sangitaratnakara, literally, ocean, of, music, and, dance, by, sarngadeva, patronized, by, king, sighana, of, the, yadava, dynasty, in, maharashtra, mentions, and, discusses, ragas, and, talas, he, identifies, seven, tala, families, then, subdivides, them, into, rhythmic, ratios, presenting, a, methodology, for, improvization, and, composition, that, continues, to, inspire, modern, era, indian, musicians, sangitaratnakara, is, one, of, the, most, complete, historic, medieval, era, hindu, treatises, on, this, subject, that, has, survived, into, the, modern, era, that, relates, to, the, structure, technique, and, reasoning, behind, ragas, and, talas, the, centrality, and, significance, of, music, in, ancient, and, early, medieval, india, is, also, expressed, in, numerous, temple, and, shrine, reliefs, in, buddhism, hinduism, and, jainism, such, as, through, the, carving, of, musicians, with, cymbals, at, the, fifth, century, pavaya, temple, sculpture, near, gwalior, and, the, ellora, caves, the, post, vedic, era, historical, literature, relating, to, indian, classical, music, has, been, extensive, the, ancient, and, medieval, texts, are, primarily, in, sanskrit, hinduism, but, major, reviews, of, music, theory, instruments, and, practice, were, also, composed, in, regional, languages, such, as, kannada, odia, pali, buddhism, prakrit, jainism, tamil, and, telugu, while, numerous, manuscripts, have, survived, into, the, modern, era, many, original, works, on, indian, music, are, believed, to, be, lost, and, are, known, to, have, existed, only, because, they, are, quoted, and, discussed, in, other, manuscripts, on, classical, indian, music, many, of, the, encyclopedic, puranas, contain, large, chapters, on, music, theory, and, instruments, such, as, the, bhagavata, purana, the, markandeya, purana, the, vayu, purana, the, linga, purana, and, the, visnudharmottara, purana, the, most, cited, and, influential, among, these, texts, are, the, sama, veda, natya, shastra, classic, treatise, on, music, theory, gandharva, dattilam, brihaddesi, treatise, on, regional, classical, music, forms, and, sangita, ratnakara, definitive, text, for, carnatic, and, hindustani, traditions, most, historic, music, theory, texts, have, been, by, hindu, scholars, some, classical, music, texts, were, also, composed, by, buddhists, and, jain, scholars, and, in, 16th, century, by, muslim, scholars, these, are, listed, in, the, attached, table, the, classical, music, tradition, of, the, ancient, and, medieval, indian, subcontinent, modern, bangladesh, india, pakistan, were, a, generally, integrated, system, through, the, 14th, century, after, which, the, socio, political, turmoil, of, the, delhi, sultanate, era, isolated, the, north, from, the, south, the, music, traditions, of, the, north, and, south, india, were, not, considered, distinct, until, about, the, 16th, century, but, after, that, the, traditions, acquired, distinct, forms, north, indian, classical, music, is, called, hindustani, while, the, south, indian, expression, is, called, carnatic, sometimes, spelled, as, karnatic, according, to, nazir, ali, jairazbhoy, the, north, indian, tradition, acquired, its, modern, form, after, the, 14th, or, the, 15th, century, indian, classical, music, has, historically, adopted, and, evolved, with, many, regional, styles, such, as, the, bengali, classical, tradition, this, openness, to, ideas, led, to, assimilation, of, regional, folk, innovations, as, well, as, influences, that, arrived, from, outside, the, subcontinent, for, example, hindustani, music, assimilated, arabian, and, persian, influences, this, assimilation, of, ideas, was, upon, the, ancient, classical, foundations, such, as, raga, tala, matras, as, well, as, the, musical, instruments, for, example, the, persian, r, k, is, probably, a, pronunciation, of, raga, according, to, hormoz, farhat, r, k, has, no, meaning, in, modern, persian, language, and, the, concept, of, raga, is, unknown, in, persia, if, hindustani, music, is, taken, in, as, an, entirely, new, form, of, music, created, from, indian, classical, music, and, persian, music, then, carnatic, music, was, a, form, from, the, south, of, the, sub, continent, that, developed, further, natively, after, this, divergence, carnatic, music, is, the, ancient, indian, classical, music, that, became, distinct, after, hindustani, music, was, established, it, is, dated, back, to, ancient, periods, but, was, only, distinct, after, hindustani, music, was, established, purandara, dasa, 1484, 1564, was, a, hindu, composer, and, musicologist, who, lived, in, hampi, of, the, vijayanagara, empire, he, is, considered, pithamaha, literally, great, father, or, grandfather, of, the, carnatic, music, purandara, dasa, was, a, monk, and, a, devotee, of, the, hindu, god, krishna, vishnu, vittal, avatar, he, systematised, classical, indian, music, theory, and, developed, exercises, for, musicians, to, learn, and, perfect, their, art, he, travelled, widely, sharing, and, teaching, his, ideas, and, influenced, numerous, south, indian, and, maharashtra, bhakti, movement, musicians, these, exercises, his, teachings, about, raga, and, his, systematic, methodology, called, suladi, sapta, tala, literally, primordial, seven, talas, remains, in, use, in, contemporary, times, the, efforts, of, purandara, dasa, in, the, 16th, century, began, the, carnatic, style, of, indian, classical, music, carnatic, music, from, south, india, tends, to, be, more, rhythmically, intensive, and, structured, than, hindustani, music, examples, of, this, are, the, logical, classification, of, ragas, into, melakartas, and, the, use, of, fixed, compositions, similar, to, western, classical, music, carnatic, raga, elaborations, are, generally, much, faster, in, tempo, and, shorter, than, their, equivalents, in, hindustani, music, in, addition, accompanists, have, a, much, larger, role, in, carnatic, concerts, than, in, hindustani, concerts, today, s, typical, concert, structure, was, put, in, place, by, the, vocalist, ariyakudi, ramanuja, iyengar, the, opening, piece, is, called, a, varnam, and, is, a, warm, up, for, the, musicians, a, devotion, and, a, request, for, a, blessing, follows, then, a, series, of, interchanges, between, ragams, unmetered, melody, and, tanam, the, ornamentation, within, a, melorhythmic, cycle, equivalent, to, the, jor, this, is, intermixed, with, hymns, called, krithis, the, pallavi, or, theme, from, the, raga, then, follows, carnatic, pieces, also, have, notated, lyrical, poems, that, are, reproduced, as, such, possibly, with, embellishments, and, treatments, according, to, the, performer, s, ideology, referred, to, as, manodharmam, primary, themes, include, worship, descriptions, of, temples, philosophy, and, nayaka, nayika, sanskrit, hero, heroine, themes, tyagaraja, 1759, 1847, muthuswami, dikshitar, 1776, 1827, and, syama, sastri, 1762, 1827, have, been, the, important, historic, scholars, of, carnatic, music, according, to, eleanor, zelliot, tyagaraja, is, known, in, the, carnatic, tradition, as, one, of, its, greatest, composers, and, he, reverentially, acknowledged, the, influence, of, purandara, dasa, a, common, belief, is, that, carnatic, music, represents, a, more, ancient, and, refined, approach, to, classical, music, whereas, hindustani, music, has, evolved, by, external, influences, it, is, unclear, when, the, process, of, differentiation, of, hindustani, music, started, the, process, may, have, started, in, the, 14th, century, courts, of, the, delhi, sultans, however, according, to, jairazbhoy, the, north, indian, tradition, likely, acquired, its, modern, form, after, the, 14th, or, after, the, 15th, century, the, development, of, hindustani, music, reached, a, peak, during, the, reign, of, akbar, during, this, 16th, century, period, tansen, studied, music, and, introduced, musical, innovations, for, about, the, first, sixty, years, of, his, life, with, patronage, of, the, hindu, king, ram, chand, of, gwalior, and, thereafter, performed, at, the, muslim, court, of, akbar, many, musicians, consider, tansen, as, the, founder, of, hindustani, music, tansen, s, style, and, innovations, inspired, many, and, many, modern, gharanas, hindustani, music, teaching, houses, link, themselves, to, his, lineage, the, muslim, courts, discouraged, sanskrit, and, encouraged, technical, music, such, constraints, led, hindustani, music, to, evolve, in, a, different, way, than, carnatic, music, hindustani, music, style, is, mainly, found, in, north, india, pakistan, and, bangladesh, it, exists, in, four, major, forms, dhrupad, khyal, or, khayal, tarana, and, the, semi, classical, thumri, dhrupad, is, ancient, khyal, evolved, from, it, thumri, evolved, from, khyal, there, are, three, major, schools, of, thumri, lucknow, gharana, banaras, gharana, and, punjabi, gharana, these, weave, in, folk, music, innovations, tappa, is, the, most, folksy, one, which, likely, existed, in, rajasthan, and, punjab, region, before, it, was, systematized, and, integrated, into, classical, music, structure, it, became, popular, with, the, bengali, musicians, developing, their, own, tappa, khyal, is, the, modern, form, of, hindustani, music, and, the, term, literally, means, imagination, it, is, significant, because, it, was, the, template, for, sufi, musicians, among, the, islamic, community, of, india, and, qawwals, sang, their, folk, songs, in, the, khyal, format, dhrupad, or, dhruvapad, the, ancient, form, described, in, the, hindu, text, natyashastra, is, one, of, the, core, forms, of, classical, music, found, all, over, the, indian, subcontinent, the, word, comes, from, dhruva, which, means, immovable, and, permanent, a, dhrupad, has, at, least, four, stanzas, called, sthayi, or, asthayi, antara, sanchari, and, abhoga, the, sthayi, part, is, a, melody, that, uses, the, middle, octave, s, first, tetrachord, and, the, lower, octave, notes, the, antara, part, uses, the, middle, octave, s, second, tetrachord, and, the, higher, octave, notes, the, sanchari, part, is, the, development, phase, which, builds, using, parts, of, sthayi, and, antara, already, played, and, it, uses, melodic, material, built, with, all, the, three, octave, notes, the, abhoga, is, the, concluding, section, that, brings, the, listener, back, to, the, familiar, starting, point, of, sthayi, albeit, with, rhythmic, variations, with, diminished, notes, like, a, gentle, goodbye, that, are, ideally, mathematical, fractions, such, as, dagun, half, tigun, third, or, chaugun, fourth, sometimes, a, fifth, stanza, called, bhoga, is, included, though, usually, related, to, philosophical, or, bhakti, emotional, devotion, to, a, god, or, goddess, themes, some, dhrupads, were, composed, to, praise, kings, improvisation, is, of, central, importance, to, hindustani, music, and, each, gharana, school, tradition, has, developed, its, own, techniques, at, its, core, it, starts, with, a, standard, composition, bandish, then, expands, it, in, a, process, called, vistar, the, improvisation, methods, have, ancient, roots, and, one, of, the, more, common, techniques, is, called, alap, which, is, followed, by, the, jor, and, jhala, the, alap, explores, possible, tonal, combinations, among, other, things, jor, explores, speed, or, tempo, faster, while, jhala, explores, complex, combinations, like, a, fishnet, of, strokes, while, keeping, the, beat, patterns, as, with, carnatic, music, hindustani, music, has, assimilated, various, folk, tunes, for, example, ragas, such, as, kafi, and, jaijaiwanti, are, based, on, folk, tunes, hindustani, music, has, had, arab, and, persian, music, influences, including, the, creation, of, new, ragas, and, the, development, of, instruments, such, as, the, sitar, and, sarod, the, nature, of, these, influences, are, unclear, scholars, have, attempted, to, study, arabic, maqam, also, spelled, makam, of, arabian, peninsula, turkey, and, northern, africa, and, dastgah, of, iran, to, discern, the, nature, and, extent, through, the, colonial, era, and, until, the, 1960s, the, attempt, was, to, theoretically, study, ragas, and, maqams, and, suggested, commonalities, later, comparative, musicology, studies, states, bruno, nettl, a, professor, of, music, have, found, the, similarities, between, classical, indian, music, and, european, music, as, well, raising, the, question, about, the, point, of, similarities, and, of, departures, between, the, different, world, music, systems, one, of, the, earliest, known, discussions, of, persian, maqam, and, indian, ragas, is, by, the, late, 16th, century, scholar, pundarika, vittala, he, states, that, persian, maqams, in, use, in, his, times, had, been, derived, from, older, indian, ragas, or, mela, and, he, specifically, maps, over, a, dozen, maqam, for, example, vittala, states, that, the, hijaz, maqam, was, derived, from, the, asaveri, raga, and, jangula, was, derived, from, the, bangal, in, 1941, haidar, rizvi, questioned, this, and, stated, that, influence, was, in, the, other, direction, middle, eastern, maqams, were, turned, into, indian, ragas, such, as, zangulah, maqam, becoming, jangla, raga, according, to, john, baily, a, professor, of, ethnomusicology, there, is, evidence, that, the, traffic, of, musical, ideas, were, both, ways, because, persian, records, confirm, that, indian, musicians, were, a, part, of, the, qajar, court, in, tehran, an, interaction, that, continued, through, the, 20th, century, with, import, of, indian, musical, instruments, in, cities, such, as, herat, near, afghanistan, iran, border, odissi, music, is, a, distinct, type, of, classical, music, of, eastern, india, this, music, is, sung, during, performance, of, classical, odissi, dance, the, traditional, ritual, music, for, the, service, of, lord, jagannatha, odissi, music, has, a, history, spanning, over, two, thousand, years, authentic, sangita, shastras, or, treatises, unique, ragas, talas, and, a, distinctive, style, of, rendition, the, various, aspects, of, odissi, music, include, odissi, prabandha, chaupadi, chh, nda, champu, chautisa, jan, na, m, lasri, bhajana, sarim, na, jhul, kuduka, koili, poi, boli, and, more, presentation, dynamics, are, roughly, classified, into, four, raganga, bhabanga, natyanga, and, dhrubapadanga, some, great, composer, poets, of, the, odissi, tradition, are, the, 12th, century, poet, jayadeva, balarama, dasa, atibadi, jagannatha, dasa, dinakrusna, dasa, kabi, samrata, upendra, bhanja, banamali, dasa, kabisurjya, baladeba, ratha, abhimanyu, samanta, singhara, and, kabikalahansa, gopalakrusna, pattanayaka, classical, indian, music, is, one, genre, of, south, asian, music, others, include, film, music, various, varieties, of, pop, regional, folk, religious, and, devotional, music, in, indian, classical, music, the, raga, and, the, tala, are, two, foundational, elements, the, raga, forms, the, fabric, of, a, melodic, structure, and, the, tala, keeps, the, time, cycle, both, raga, and, tala, are, open, frameworks, for, creativity, and, allow, a, very, large, number, of, possibilities, however, the, tradition, considers, a, few, hundred, ragas, and, talas, as, basic, raga, is, intimately, related, to, tala, or, guidance, about, division, of, time, with, each, unit, called, a, matra, beat, and, duration, between, beats, a, raga, is, a, central, concept, of, indian, music, predominant, in, its, expression, according, to, walter, kaufmann, though, a, remarkable, and, prominent, feature, of, indian, music, a, definition, of, raga, cannot, be, offered, in, one, or, two, sentences, raga, may, be, roughly, described, as, a, musical, entity, that, includes, note, intonation, relative, duration, and, order, in, a, manner, similar, to, how, words, flexibly, form, phrases, to, create, an, atmosphere, of, expression, in, some, cases, certain, rules, are, considered, obligatory, in, others, optional, the, raga, allows, flexibility, where, the, artist, may, rely, on, simple, expression, or, may, add, ornamentations, yet, express, the, same, essential, message, but, evoke, a, different, intensity, of, mood, a, raga, has, a, given, set, of, notes, on, a, scale, ordered, in, melodies, with, musical, motifs, a, musician, playing, a, raga, states, bruno, nettl, may, traditionally, use, just, these, notes, but, is, free, to, emphasize, or, improvise, certain, degrees, of, the, scale, the, indian, tradition, suggests, a, certain, sequencing, of, how, the, musician, moves, from, note, to, note, for, each, raga, in, order, for, the, performance, to, create, a, rasa, mood, atmosphere, essence, inner, feeling, that, is, unique, to, each, raga, a, raga, can, be, written, on, a, scale, theoretically, thousands, of, raga, are, possible, given, 5, or, more, notes, but, in, practical, use, the, classical, indian, tradition, has, refined, and, typically, relies, on, several, hundred, for, most, artists, their, basic, perfected, repertoire, has, some, forty, to, fifty, ragas, raga, in, indian, classical, music, is, intimately, related, to, tala, or, guidance, about, division, of, time, with, each, unit, called, a, matra, beat, and, duration, between, beats, a, raga, is, not, a, tune, because, the, same, raga, can, yield, a, very, large, number, of, tunes, a, raga, is, not, a, scale, because, many, ragas, can, be, based, on, the, same, scale, a, raga, states, bruno, nettl, and, other, music, scholars, is, a, concept, similar, to, mode, something, between, the, domains, of, tune, and, scale, and, it, is, best, conceptualized, as, a, unique, array, of, melodic, features, mapped, to, and, organized, for, a, unique, aesthetic, sentiment, in, the, listener, the, goal, of, a, raga, and, its, artist, is, to, create, rasa, essence, feeling, atmosphere, with, music, as, classical, indian, dance, does, with, performance, arts, in, the, indian, tradition, classical, dances, are, performed, with, music, set, to, various, ragas, according, to, david, nelson, an, ethnomusicology, scholar, specializing, in, carnatic, music, a, tala, in, indian, music, covers, the, whole, subject, of, musical, meter, indian, music, is, composed, and, performed, in, a, metrical, framework, a, structure, of, beats, that, is, a, tala, a, tala, measures, musical, time, in, indian, music, however, it, does, not, imply, a, regular, repeating, accent, pattern, instead, its, hierarchical, arrangement, depends, on, how, the, musical, piece, is, supposed, to, be, performed, the, tala, forms, the, metrical, structure, that, repeats, in, a, cyclical, harmony, from, the, start, to, end, of, any, particular, song, or, dance, segment, making, it, conceptually, analogous, to, meters, in, western, music, however, talas, have, certain, qualitative, features, that, classical, european, musical, meters, do, not, for, example, some, talas, are, much, longer, than, any, classical, western, meter, such, as, a, framework, based, on, 29, beats, whose, cycle, takes, about, 45, seconds, to, complete, when, performed, another, sophistication, in, talas, is, the, lack, of, strong, weak, beat, composition, typical, of, the, traditional, european, meter, in, classical, indian, traditions, the, tala, is, not, restricted, to, permutations, of, strong, and, weak, beats, but, its, flexibility, permits, the, accent, of, a, beat, to, be, decided, by, the, shape, of, musical, phrase, the, most, widely, used, tala, in, the,
