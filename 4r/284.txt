the, nibelungenlied, german, pronunciation, middle, high, german, der, nibelunge, liet, or, der, nibelunge, n, t, translated, as, the, song, of, the, nibelungs, is, an, epic, poem, written, around, 1200, in, middle, high, german, its, anonymous, poet, was, likely, from, the, region, of, passau, the, nibelungenlied, is, based, on, an, oral, tradition, of, germanic, heroic, legend, that, has, some, of, its, origin, in, historic, events, and, individuals, of, the, 5th, and, 6th, centuries, and, that, spread, throughout, almost, all, of, germanic, speaking, europe, scandinavian, parallels, to, the, german, poem, are, found, especially, in, the, heroic, lays, of, the, poetic, edda, and, in, the, v, lsunga, saga, the, poem, is, split, into, two, parts, in, the, first, part, the, prince, siegfried, comes, to, worms, to, acquire, the, hand, of, the, burgundian, princess, kriemhild, from, her, brother, king, gunther, gunther, agrees, to, let, siegfried, marry, kriemhild, if, siegfried, helps, gunther, acquire, the, warrior, queen, br, nhild, as, his, wife, siegfried, does, this, and, marries, kriemhild, however, br, nhild, and, kriemhild, become, rivals, leading, eventually, to, siegfried, s, murder, by, the, burgundian, vassal, hagen, with, gunther, s, involvement, in, the, second, part, the, widow, kriemhild, is, married, to, etzel, king, of, the, huns, she, later, invites, her, brother, and, his, court, to, visit, etzel, s, kingdom, intending, to, kill, hagen, her, revenge, results, in, the, death, of, all, the, burgundians, who, came, to, etzel, s, court, as, well, as, the, destruction, of, etzel, s, kingdom, and, the, death, of, kriemhild, herself, the, nibelungenlied, was, the, first, heroic, epic, put, into, writing, in, germany, helping, to, found, a, larger, genre, of, written, heroic, poetry, there, the, poem, s, tragedy, appears, to, have, bothered, its, medieval, audience, and, very, early, on, a, sequel, was, written, the, nibelungenklage, which, made, the, tragedy, less, final, the, poem, was, forgotten, after, around, 1500, but, was, rediscovered, in, 1755, dubbed, the, german, iliad, the, nibelungenlied, began, a, new, life, as, the, german, national, epic, the, poem, was, appropriated, for, nationalist, purposes, and, was, heavily, used, in, anti, democratic, reactionary, and, nazi, propaganda, before, and, during, the, second, world, war, its, legacy, today, is, most, visible, in, richard, wagner, s, operatic, cycle, der, ring, des, nibelungen, which, however, is, mostly, based, on, old, norse, sources, in, 2009, the, three, main, manuscripts, of, the, nibelungenlied, were, inscribed, in, unesco, s, memory, of, the, world, register, in, recognition, of, their, historical, significance, it, has, been, called, one, of, the, most, impressive, and, certainly, the, most, powerful, of, the, german, epics, of, the, middle, ages, there, are, 37, known, manuscripts, and, manuscript, fragments, of, the, nibelungenlied, and, its, variant, versions, eleven, of, these, manuscripts, are, essentially, complete, twenty, four, manuscripts, are, in, various, fragmentary, states, of, completion, including, one, version, in, dutch, manuscript, t, the, text, of, the, different, manuscripts, of, the, nibelungenlied, varies, considerably, from, one, another, though, there, is, less, variance, than, found, in, many, other, middle, high, german, heroic, epics, such, as, the, dietrich, epics, although, the, different, versions, vary, in, their, exact, wording, and, include, or, exclude, stanzas, found, in, other, versions, the, general, order, of, events, the, order, of, the, appearance, of, characters, their, actions, and, the, content, of, their, speeches, are, all, relatively, stable, between, versions, extant, before, the, 1400s, generally, scholars, have, proposed, that, all, versions, of, the, nibelungenlied, derive, from, an, original, version, the, archetype, via, alterations, and, reworking, jan, dirk, m, ller, instead, proposes, that, the, nibelungenlied, has, always, existed, in, variant, forms, connecting, this, variance, to, the, transmission, of, the, epic, s, material, from, orality, to, literacy, using, the, versions, provided, by, the, three, oldest, complete, manuscripts, the, hohenems, munich, manuscript, a, c, 1275, 1300, the, sankt, gall, manuscript, b, c, 1233, 1266, and, the, hohenems, donaueschingen, manuscript, c, c, 1225, 1250, scholars, have, traditionally, differentiated, two, versions, that, existed, near, the, time, of, the, poem, s, composition, a, and, b, are, counted, as, belonging, to, a, single, version, ab, while, a, version, c, is, attested, by, manuscript, c, and, most, of, the, earliest, fragments, including, the, oldest, attestation, of, the, nibelungenlied, using, the, final, words, of, the, epic, ab, is, also, called, the, not, version, and, c, the, lied, version, the, c, version, is, clearly, a, reworking, of, an, earlier, version, but, it, is, not, clear, if, this, version, was, ab, ab, may, also, be, an, expanded, version, of, an, earlier, text, most, scholars, assume, that, manuscript, b, is, the, closest, to, the, original, ab, version, by, 1300, the, nibelungenlied, was, circulating, in, at, least, five, versions, most, fragments, from, after, 1300, belong, to, the, two, mixed, versions, mischenfassungen, which, appear, to, be, based, on, copies, of, both, the, not, and, lied, versions, three, later, manuscripts, provide, variant, versions, one, m, after, 1450, is, lost, while, two, are, still, extant, n, c, 1470, 80, and, k, c, 1480, 90, manuscripts, m, and, n, contain, a, story, of, siegfried, s, youth, that, more, closely, resembles, that, found, in, the, old, norse, i, reks, saga, and, early, modern, german, lied, vom, h, rnen, seyfrid, while, k, shortens, the, text, and, modernizes, the, language, the, famous, opening, of, the, nibelungenlied, is, actually, thought, to, be, an, addition, by, the, adaptor, of, the, c, version, of, the, nibelungenlied, as, it, does, not, appear, in, the, manuscript, of, b, which, probably, represents, the, earlier, version, it, may, have, been, inspired, by, the, prologue, of, the, nibelungenklage, manuscript, b, instead, begins, with, the, introduction, of, kriemhild, the, protagonist, of, the, work, kriemhild, grows, up, as, a, beautiful, woman, in, worms, the, capital, of, the, burgundian, kingdom, under, the, protection, of, her, brothers, gunther, gernot, and, giselher, there, she, has, a, dream, portending, doom, in, which, she, raises, a, falcon, that, is, killed, by, two, eagles, her, mother, explains, that, this, means, she, will, love, a, man, who, will, be, killed, kriemhild, thus, swears, to, remain, unmarried, at, the, same, time, the, young, siegfried, is, receiving, his, courtly, education, in, the, netherlands, he, is, dubbed, a, knight, and, decides, that, he, will, go, to, worms, to, ask, for, kriemhild, as, his, wife, the, story, of, how, siegfried, slew, a, dragon, winning, a, large, hoard, of, gold, and, then, bathed, in, the, dragon, s, blood, to, receive, an, impenetrable, skin, is, then, recounted, by, hagen, one, of, gunther, s, vassals, when, the, burgundians, see, siegfried, approaching, siegfried, lives, in, worms, for, a, year, without, seeing, kriemhild, before, siegfried, helps, gunther, fight, against, attack, by, the, saxons, and, danes, because, of, his, valor, in, combat, he, is, finally, allowed, to, see, kriemhild, gunther, decides, that, he, wishes, to, take, the, icelandic, queen, br, nhild, as, his, wife, however, br, nhild, is, supernaturally, strong, and, challenges, those, seeking, her, hand, in, marriage, in, various, martial, and, physical, contests, killing, the, losers, therefore, gunther, wants, siegfried, s, help, siegfried, tells, gunther, he, shouldn, t, marry, br, nhild, but, is, convinced, to, help, by, gunther, s, promise, that, he, will, let, him, marry, kriemhild, in, exchange, arriving, in, iceland, siegfried, claims, to, be, gunther, s, vassal, and, uses, his, magical, cloak, of, invisibility, tarnkappe, to, secretly, help, gunther, win, in, all, of, the, contests, and, br, nhilt, agrees, to, return, to, worms, and, marry, gunther, once, they, have, returned, siegfried, ask, kriemhild, to, marry, him, this, displeases, br, nhild, as, she, believes, siegfried, to, be, a, vassal, while, kriemhild, is, the, daughter, of, a, king, when, gunther, does, not, explain, why, he, is, letting, a, vassal, marry, his, sister, br, nhild, refuses, to, sleep, with, him, on, their, wedding, night, instead, tying, him, up, and, hanging, him, from, a, hook, the, next, night, gunther, asks, siegfried, to, wrestle, br, nhild, into, submission, using, his, tarnkappe, siegfried, takes, br, nhilds, belt, and, ring, as, a, trophy, and, then, lets, gunther, take, her, virginity, causing, her, to, lose, her, strength, after, the, wedding, siegfried, and, kriemhild, return, to, the, netherlands, before, they, do, kriemhild, wants, to, ask, for, her, part, of, the, inheritance, from, her, brothers, but, siegfried, advises, her, not, to, kriemhild, wishes, to, take, hagen, with, her, but, he, refuses, many, years, pass, in, the, netherlands, siegfried, and, kriemhild, are, crowned, both, couples, have, a, son, br, nhild, is, unhappy, that, siegfried, whom, she, still, believes, to, be, gunther, s, vassal, never, comes, to, pay, tribute, she, convinces, gunther, to, invite, siegfried, and, kriemhild, to, worms, for, a, feast, however, she, and, kriemhild, soon, begin, arguing, about, which, of, their, husband, s, has, the, higher, rank, the, conflict, peaks, when, both, kriemhild, and, br, nhild, arrive, at, the, cathedral, at, the, same, time, the, higher, ranking, one, should, enter, first, br, nhild, repeats, her, assertion, that, siegfried, is, a, vassal, after, which, kriemhild, claims, that, siegfried, not, gunther, took, br, nhild, s, virginity, producing, the, ring, and, belt, as, proof, siegfried, and, gunther, afterwards, deny, this, but, br, nhild, remains, offended, hagen, advises, gunther, to, have, siegfried, murdered, hagen, goes, to, kriemhild, and, tells, her, that, there, is, a, new, war, brewing, against, the, saxons, he, would, like, to, know, where, siegfried, is, vulnerable, so, that, he, can, protect, him, kriemhild, agrees, to, mark, the, spot, between, siegfried, s, shoulder, blades, where, a, leaf, had, prevented, his, skin, from, becoming, invulnerable, rather, than, a, war, however, gunther, invites, siegfried, to, go, hunting, when, siegfried, is, bent, over, a, spring, to, drink, water, hagen, spears, him, in, the, back, killing, him, the, body, is, placed, in, front, of, kriemhild, s, door, kriemhild, immediately, suspects, gunther, and, hagen, and, her, suspicions, are, confirmed, when, siegfried, s, corpse, bleeds, in, hagen, s, presence, siegfried, is, buried, and, kriemhild, chooses, to, stay, in, worms, eventually, officially, reconciling, with, hagen, and, her, brothers, though, she, stays, in, mourning, hagen, has, siegfried, s, hoard, taken, from, her, kriemhild, remains, unmarried, for, 13, years, after, the, death, of, his, first, wife, helche, etzel, the, king, of, the, huns, chooses, to, ask, kriemhild, to, marry, him, all, of, the, burgundians, except, for, hagen, are, in, favor, of, the, match, kriemhild, agrees, only, agrees, after, etzel, s, messenger, margrave, r, diger, von, bechelaren, swears, loyalty, to, her, personally, and, she, realizes, she, can, use, the, huns, to, gain, revenge, on, siegfried, s, murderers, before, her, departure, she, demands, siegfried, s, treasure, but, hagen, refuses, her, after, seven, years, as, etzel, s, wife, kriemhild, bears, him, a, son, ortlieb, and, after, thirteen, years, she, convinces, etzel, to, invite, her, brothers, and, hagen, to, a, feast, in, worms, hagen, advises, against, traveling, to, etzel, s, castle, but, gunther, and, his, brothers, believe, that, kriemhild, has, reconciled, with, them, and, decide, to, go, nevertheless, they, take, hagen, s, advice, to, travel, with, an, army, the, departure, of, the, burgundians, who, are, now, increasingly, called, nibelungs, is, accompanied, by, various, ill, omens, but, these, are, all, dismissed, by, hagen, when, the, burgundians, are, about, to, cross, the, danube, in, bavaria, hagen, encounters, three, nixies, who, prophecy, to, him, that, only, the, king, s, chaplain, will, return, from, etzel, s, hall, to, try, to, prove, the, prophecy, false, hagen, throws, the, chaplain, overboard, from, the, ferry, but, he, swims, to, shore, and, returns, to, worms, hagen, then, destroys, the, ferry, once, they, have, landed, to, show, that, there, can, be, no, return, when, the, bavarians, attack, the, burgundians, in, order, to, avenge, their, ferryman, whom, hagen, had, killed, hagen, takes, control, of, the, defense, and, defeats, them, the, burgundians, then, arrive, in, etzel, s, kingdom, and, are, welcomed, to, the, city, of, bechelaren, by, the, margrave, r, diger, on, hagen, s, suggestion, r, diger, betroths, his, daughter, to, gisleher, and, gives, gernot, a, sword, and, hagen, a, shield, when, the, burgundians, arrive, at, etzelnburg, they, are, warned, by, dietrich, von, bern, that, kriemhild, hates, them, kriemhild, greets, only, gisleher, with, a, kiss, and, asks, hagen, if, he, has, brought, with, him, what, he, took, from, her, later, she, approaches, him, wearing, her, crown, and, in, the, company, of, many, armed, men, hagen, refuses, to, stand, up, for, kriemhild, and, places, siegfried, s, sword, across, her, legs, recognizing, it, kriemhild, s, accompanying, huns, still, refuse, to, attack, hagen, etzel, meanwhile, is, clueless, about, these, events, and, welcomes, his, guests, warmly, hagen, advises, the, burgundians, to, remain, armed, fighting, almost, breaks, out, at, a, tournament, when, the, burgundian, volker, von, alzey, kills, a, hun, in, a, joust, but, etzel, is, able, to, prevent, it, kriemhild, then, seeks, to, convince, dietrich, von, bern, and, hildebrand, to, attack, the, burgundians, they, refuse, but, etzel, s, brother, bloedelin, agrees, at, the, following, feast, kriemhild, has, her, and, etzel, s, son, ortlieb, brought, into, the, hall, bloedelin, then, attacks, and, kills, the, burgundian, squires, outside, the, feast, hall, but, is, killed, by, hagen, s, brother, dankwart, when, dankwart, the, sole, survivor, enters, the, hall, and, reports, the, attack, hagen, beheads, ortlieb, and, fighting, breaks, out, within, the, feast, hall, itself, the, huns, are, unarmed, and, slaughtered, but, dietrich, and, hildebrand, arrange, for, etzel, kriemhild, r, diger, and, their, own, men, to, exit, the, hall, the, burgundians, barricade, themselves, in, the, hall, which, is, besieged, by, etzel, s, warriors, various, hunnish, attempts, to, attack, are, repulsed, but, a, truce, cannot, be, agreed, because, kriemhild, demands, that, hagen, be, handed, over, to, her, kriemhild, orders, the, hall, set, on, fire, but, the, burgundians, survive, the, next, day, etzel, and, kriemhild, force, r, diger, to, enter, the, battle, although, he, is, bound, by, guest, friendship, and, kinship, to, the, burgundians, he, fights, gernot, and, the, two, kill, each, other, r, diger, s, death, causes, dietrich, von, bern, s, heroes, to, intervene, although, dietrich, has, told, them, not, to, the, conflict, leads, to, the, death, of, all, the, burgundians, except, hagen, and, gunther, and, all, of, dietrich, s, heroes, except, for, his, mentor, hildebrand, dietrich, himself, now, fights, and, takes, hagen, and, gunther, prisoner, kriemhild, demands, that, hagen, give, her, back, what, he, has, taken, from, her, he, convinces, her, that, he, will, tell, her, where, siegfried, s, hoard, is, if, she, first, kills, gunther, but, afterwards, tells, her, that, now, she, will, never, learn, kriemhild, kills, hagen, with, siegfried, s, sword, that, this, great, hero, has, been, killed, by, a, woman, sickens, etzel, dietrich, and, hildebrand, hagen, s, death, so, enrages, hildebrand, that, he, kills, kriemhild, the, nibelungenlied, like, other, middle, high, german, heroic, epics, is, anonymous, this, anonymity, extends, to, discussions, of, literature, in, other, middle, high, german, works, although, it, is, common, practice, to, judge, or, praise, the, poems, of, others, no, other, poet, refers, to, the, author, of, the, nibelungenlied, attempts, to, identify, the, nibelungenlied, poet, with, known, authors, such, as, bligger, von, steinach, to, whom, a, lost, epic, is, attributed, by, gottfried, von, strassburg, have, not, found, wide, acceptance, the, poem, is, nevertheless, believed, to, have, had, a, single, author, possibly, working, in, a, nibelungen, workshop, nibelungenwerkstatt, together, with, the, author, of, the, nibelungenklage, the, latter, work, identifies, a, meister, konrad, as, the, author, of, an, original, latin, version, of, the, nibelungenlied, but, this, is, generally, taken, for, a, fiction, although, a, single, nibelungenlied, poet, is, often, posited, the, degree, of, variance, in, the, text, and, its, background, in, an, amorphous, oral, tradition, mean, that, ideas, of, authorial, intention, must, be, applied, with, caution, it, is, also, possible, that, there, were, several, poets, involved, perhaps, under, the, direction, of, a, single, leader, who, could, be, considered, the, nibelungenlied, poet, the, nibelungenlied, is, conventionally, dated, to, around, the, year, 1200, wolfram, von, eschenbach, references, the, cook, rumolt, usually, taken, to, be, an, invention, of, the, nibelungenlied, poet, in, his, romance, parzival, c, 1204, 5, thereby, providing, an, upper, bound, on, the, date, the, epic, must, have, been, composed, additionally, the, poem, s, rhyming, technique, most, closely, resembles, that, used, between, 1190, and, 1205, attempts, to, show, that, the, poem, alludes, to, various, historical, events, have, generally, not, been, convincing, the, current, theory, of, the, creation, of, the, poem, emphasizes, the, poet, s, concentration, on, the, region, of, passau, for, example, the, poem, highlights, the, relatively, unimportant, figure, of, bishop, pilgrim, of, passau, and, the, poet, s, geographical, knowledge, appears, much, more, firm, in, this, region, than, elsewhere, these, facts, combined, with, the, dating, have, led, scholars, to, believe, that, wolfger, von, erla, bishop, of, passau, reigned, 1191, 1204, was, the, patron, of, the, poem, wolfger, is, known, to, have, patronized, other, literary, figures, such, as, walther, von, der, vogelweide, and, thomasin, von, zirclaere, the, attention, paid, to, bishop, pilgrim, who, represents, the, real, historical, figure, bishop, pilgrim, of, passau, would, thus, be, an, indirect, homage, to, wolfger, wolfger, was, moreover, attempting, to, establish, the, sainthood, of, pilgrim, at, the, time, of, the, poem, s, composition, giving, an, additional, reason, for, his, prominence, some, debate, exists, as, to, whether, the, poem, is, an, entirely, new, creation, or, whether, there, was, a, previous, version, german, medievalist, jan, dirk, m, ller, claims, that, the, poem, in, its, written, form, is, entirely, new, although, he, admits, the, possibility, that, an, orally, transmitted, epic, with, relatively, consistent, contents, could, have, preceded, it, german, philologist, elisabeth, lienert, on, the, other, hand, posits, an, earlier, version, of, the, text, from, around, 1150, due, to, the, nibelungenlied, s, use, of, a, stanzaic, form, current, around, that, time, see, form, and, style, whoever, the, poet, may, have, been, they, appear, to, have, had, a, knowledge, of, german, minnesang, and, chivalric, romance, the, poem, s, concentration, on, love, minne, and, its, depiction, of, siegfried, as, engaging, in, love, service, for, kriemhild, is, in, line, with, courtly, romances, of, the, time, with, heinrich, von, veldeke, s, eneasroman, perhaps, providing, concrete, models, other, possible, influences, are, hartmann, von, aue, s, iwein, and, erec, these, courtly, elements, are, described, by, jan, dirk, m, ller, as, something, of, a, fa, ade, under, which, the, older, heroic, ethos, of, the, poem, remains, additionally, the, poet, seems, to, have, known, latin, literature, the, role, given, to, kriemhild, in, the, second, originally, first, stanza, is, suggestive, of, helen, of, troy, and, the, poem, appears, to, have, taken, a, number, of, elements, from, vergil, s, aeneid, there, is, some, debate, as, to, whether, the, poet, was, acquainted, with, old, french, chanson, de, geste, the, language, of, the, nibelungenlied, is, characterized, by, its, formulaic, nature, a, feature, of, oral, poetry, meaning, that, similar, or, identical, words, epithets, phrases, and, even, lines, can, be, found, in, various, positions, throughout, the, poem, these, elements, can, be, used, flexibly, for, different, purposes, in, the, poem, as, the, nibelungenlied, is, generally, thought, to, have, been, conceived, as, a, written, work, these, elements, are, typically, taken, as, signs, of, fictive, orality, fingierte, m, ndlichkeit, that, underscore, the, connection, of, the, poem, to, its, traditionally, oral, subject, matter, the, nibelungenlied, is, written, in, four, line, stanzas, although, no, melody, has, survived, for, the, text, melodies, for, similar, stanzas, in, other, german, heroic, poems, have, so, that, it, is, certain, that, the, text, was, meant, to, be, sung, the, stanza, consists, of, three, langzeilen, long, lines, which, consist, of, three, metrical, feet, a, caesura, and, three, metrical, feet, following, the, caesura, the, fourth, line, adds, an, additional, foot, following, the, caesura, making, it, longer, than, the, other, three, and, marking, the, end, of, the, stanza, the, final, word, before, the, caesura, is, typically, female, a, stressed, syllable, followed, by, an, unstressed, syllable, whereas, the, final, word, of, a, line, is, typical, male, a, stressed, syllable, the, lines, rhyme, in, pairs, and, occasionally, there, are, internal, rhymes, between, the, words, at, the, end, of, the, caesura, as, in, the, first, stanza, see, synopsis, medieval, german, literature, scholar, victor, millet, uses, the, poem, s, sixth, stanza, as, an, example, of, this, metrical, form, an, acute, accent, indicates, the, stressed, beat, of, a, metrical, foot,

cites, an, oral, story, telling, tradition, in, using, singable, stanzas, however, the, longer, final, line, is, generally, thought, to, belong, to, a, more, refined, artistic, milieu, as, later, heroic, epics, typically, use, a, stanza, without, this, longer, final, line, the, so, called, hildebrandston, the, stanzaic, form, of, the, nibelungenlied, on, the, other, hand, is, shared, with, the, danubian, minnesinger, known, as, der, von, k, renberg, who, flourished, in, the, 1150s, and, 1160s, the, nibelungenlied, poet, may, have, been, inspired, by, this, lyrical, stanza, their, use, of, the, stanza, would, thus, cite, an, oral, story, telling, tradition, while, at, the, same, time, creating, some, distance, to, it, philologist, andreas, heusler, supposed, that, the, poet, had, taken, some, earlier, orally, transmitted, stanzas, and, added, a, fourth, foot, to, their, final, line, as, these, supposedly, older, stanzas, are, characterized, by, a, more, archaic, vocabulary, as, well, german, medievalist, jan, dirk, m, ller, notes, that, while, it, would, be, typical, of, a, medieval, poet, to, incorporate, lines, from, other, works, in, their, own, no, stanza, of, the, nibelungenlied, can, be, proven, to, have, come, from, an, older, poem, the, nature, of, the, stanza, creates, a, structure, whereby, the, narrative, progresses, in, blocks, the, first, three, lines, carry, the, story, forward, while, the, fourth, introduces, foreshadowing, of, the, disaster, at, the, end, or, comments, on, events, the, fourth, line, is, thus, often, the, most, formulaic, of, the, stanza, stanzas, often, seem, to, have, been, placed, after, each, other, without, necessarily, being, causally, or, narratively, connected, for, instance, two, consecutive, stanzas, might, portray, two, different, reactions, to, an, event, by, the, same, figure, often, the, same, reaction, is, given, to, multiple, figures, in, different, stanzas, so, that, the, impression, of, collective, rather, than, individual, reactions, is, created, enjambment, between, stanzas, is, very, rare, the, epic, frequently, creates, multiple, motivations, for, events, some, of, which, may, contradict, each, other, this, style, of, narration, also, causes, the, events, within, the, poem, to, come, to, a, frequent, halt, which, can, last, for, years, within, the, time, portrayed, in, the, poem, the, division, of, the, epic, into, ventiuren, lit, adventures, underlines, the, disconnect, between, the, various, episodes, the, connection, between, the, first, half, of, the, epic, siegfried, s, murder, and, the, second, half, kriemhild, s, marriage, to, etzel, is, especially, loose, the, epic, nevertheless, maintains, the, causal, and, narrative, connection, between, episodes, through, the, commentary, of, the, narrator, who, frequently, reminds, the, poem, s, audience, of, the, coming, catastrophe, while, the, manner, in, which, the, epic, is, told, serves, to, delay, the, inevitable, disaster, the, action, becomes, more, and, more, intense, as, the, epic, nears, its, end, behind, nibelungenlied, stands, a, large, oral, tradition, the, so, called, nibelungen, saga, this, oral, tradition, moreover, continued, to, exist, following, the, composition, of, the, nibelungenlied, as, proven, by, the, rosengarten, zu, worms, and, das, lied, vom, h, rnen, seyfrid, both, of, which, were, written, later, than, the, nibelungenlied, but, contain, elements, of, the, saga, that, are, absent, in, it, these, oral, traditions, have, at, least, in, some, cases, a, historical, core, however, various, historical, events, and, figures, have, been, melded, together, into, a, single, plot, in, such, a, way, that, the, original, historical, context, has, been, lost, the, epic, and, presumably, the, oral, traditions, that, provided, its, material, have, transformed, historical, events, into, relatively, simple, narrative, schemas, that, can, be, compared, with, other, similar, originally, oral, narratives, from, other, cultures, what, had, originally, been, political, motivations, have, been, personalized, so, that, political, events, are, explained, through, personal, preferences, likes, dislikes, and, feuds, rather, than, purely, by, realpolitik, various, historical, personages, moreover, appear, to, be, contemporaries, in, the, poem, despite, not, having, lived, at, the, same, time, historically, the, nibelungen, saga, also, seems, to, have, had, an, early, reception, in, scandinavia, so, that, parallel, stories, are, found, among, the, heroic, lays, of, the, poetic, edda, written, down, in, 1270, but, containing, at, least, some, much, older, material, and, in, the, v, lsunga, saga, written, down, in, the, second, half, of, the, thirteenth, century, while, the, norse, texts, were, once, usually, considered, to, contain, a, more, original, version, of, the, nibelungen, saga, newer, scholarship, has, called, this, into, question, and, notes, that, the, connections, made, to, norse, mythology, and, germanic, paganism, such, as, the, semi, divine, origin, of, the, nibelungen, hoard, are, likely, more, recent, developments, that, are, therefore, unique, to, the, scandinavian, tradition, some, elements, of, the, norse, tradition, however, are, assuredly, older, the, death, of, the, burgundians, finds, its, origins, in, the, destruction, of, the, historical, burgundian, kingdom, on, the, rhine, this, kingdom, under, the, rule, of, king, gundaharius, was, destroyed, by, the, roman, general, flavius, aetius, in, 436, 437, with, survivors, resettled, in, eastern, gaul, in, a, region, centered, around, modern, day, geneva, and, lyon, at, the, time, known, as, lugdunum, the, lex, burgundionum, codified, by, the, burgundian, king, gundobad, at, the, end, of, the, sixth, century, contains, many, names, that, can, be, connected, with, the, nibelungen, saga, including, besides, gundaharius, gislaharius, giselher, gundomaris, possibly, the, historical, figure, behind, the, old, norse, gothorm, who, is, replaced, by, gernot, in, the, german, tradition, and, gibica, attested, in, germany, as, gibich, but, not, found, in, the, nibelungenlied, although, the, burgundian, kingdom, on, the, rhine, is, thus, historically, attested, the, saga, locates, its, destruction, at, the, court, of, attila, etzel, king, of, the, huns, the, destruction, of, attila, s, kingdom, itself, is, likely, inspired, by, attila, s, sudden, death, following, his, wedding, in, 453, which, was, popularly, blamed, on, his, wife, a, germanic, woman, named, hildico, her, name, containing, the, element, hild, may, have, inspired, that, of, kriemhild, kriemhild, most, likely, originally, killed, etzel, and, avenged, her, relatives, rather, than, her, husband, but, this, change, had, already, taken, place, some, time, before, the, creation, of, the, nibelungenlied, jan, dirk, m, ller, doubts, that, we, can, be, certain, which, version, is, more, original, given, that, in, both, cases, kriemhild, brings, about, the, destruction, of, the, hunnish, kingdom, the, differences, may, be, because, the, continental, saga, is, more, favorable, to, attila, than, the, norse, and, so, attila, could, not, be, held, directly, responsible, for, the, treacherous, invitation, of, the, burgundians, unlike, the, burgundians, siegfried, cannot, be, firmly, identified, with, a, historical, figure, he, may, have, his, origins, in, the, merovingian, dynasty, where, names, beginning, with, the, element, sigi, were, common, and, where, there, was, also, a, famous, and, violent, queen, brunhilda, 543, 613, the, feud, between, this, historical, brunhilda, and, the, rival, queen, fredegund, may, have, provided, the, origin, of, the, feud, between, br, nhild, and, kriemhild, the, name, siegfried, itself, is, a, relatively, recent, one, only, being, attested, from, the, seventh, century, onward, meaning, that, the, original, name, may, have, been, equivalent, to, the, old, norse, sigurd, scholars, such, as, otto, h, fler, have, speculated, that, siegfried, and, his, slaying, of, the, dragon, may, be, a, mythologized, reflection, of, arminius, and, his, defeat, of, the, roman, legions, in, the, battle, of, the, teutoburg, forest, in, 9, ad, jan, dirk, m, ller, suggests, that, siegfried, likely, has, a, more, mythological, origin, the, story, of, the, destruction, of, the, burgundians, and, siegfried, appear, to, have, been, originally, unconnected, the, old, norse, atlakvi, a, a, poem, likely, originally, from, the, ninth, century, that, has, been, reworked, as, part, of, the, poetic, edda, tells, the, story, of, the, death, of, the, burgundians, without, any, mention, of, sigurd, siegfried, and, can, be, taken, as, an, attestation, for, an, older, tradition, in, fact, the, earliest, attested, work, to, connect, siegfried, explicitly, with, the, destruction, of, the, burgundians, is, the, nibelungenlied, itself, though, old, norse, parallels, make, it, clear, that, this, tradition, must, have, existed, orally, for, some, time, when, composing, the, nibelungenlied, its, poet, was, faced, with, setting, an, oral, tradition, down, into, a, definitive, version, although, that, tradition, was, by, its, very, nature, amorphous, in, choosing, which, elements, of, the, saga, to, include, in, his, version, the, poet, therefore, often, incorporated, two, versions, of, an, event, that, were, likely, not, combined, in, the, oral, tradition, an, example, is, the, beginning, of, the, fighting, in, etzel, s, hall, which, is, motivated, both, by, an, attack, on, the, burgundians, supplies, and, hagen, s, killing, of, prince, ortlieb, the, old, norse, thidrekssaga, which, is, based, on, german, sources, contains, only, the, second, element, meaning, that, the, two, motivations, were, likely, variants, that, were, hardly, ever, combined, in, practice, victor, millet, concludes, that, the, poet, deliberately, doubles, the, motivations, or, occurrences, of, various, events, including, siegfried, s, wooing, of, kriemhild, the, deception, of, br, nhild, hagen, s, humiliation, of, kriemhild, and, kriemhild, s, demand, for, the, return, of, nibelungen, treasure, the, poet, also, appears, to, have, significantly, altered, various, aspects, of, the, saga, most, significantly, the, poet, has, suppressed, the, mythological, or, fantastical, elements, of, siegfried, s, story, when, these, elements, are, introduced, it, is, in, a, retrospective, tale, narrated, by, hagen, that, reduces, the, slaying, of, the, dragon, to, a, single, stanza, hagen, s, story, moreover, does, not, accord, with, siegfried, s, youth, as, the, narrator, of, the, nibelungenlied, has, portrayed, it, in, which, he, receives, a, courtly, education, in, xanten, more, elaborate, stories, about, siegfried, s, youth, are, found, in, the, thidrekssaga, and, in, the, later, heroic, ballad, das, lied, vom, h, rnen, seyfrid, both, of, which, appear, to, preserve, german, oral, traditions, about, the, hero, that, the, nibelungenlied, poet, decided, to, suppress, for, their, poem, the, portrayal, of, kriemhild, particularly, in, the, first, half, of, the, romance, as, a, courtly, lady, is, likely, an, invention, of, the, nibelungenlied, poet, earlier, and, many, later, attestations, of, kriemhild, outside, of, the, nibelungenlied, portray, her, as, obsessed, with, power, and, highlight, her, treachery, to, her, brothers, rather, than, her, love, for, her, husband, as, her, motivation, for, betraying, them, the, poet, still, uses, images, from, this, traditional, picture, but, given, the, new, motivation, of, the, poem, s, kriemhild, their, meaning, has, changed, for, instance, when, kriemhild, demands, that, hagen, give, back, what, he, has, taken, from, her, a, traditional, motif, known, from, the, norse, versions, she, could, mean, the, stolen, hoard, but, she, could, also, mean, her, murdered, husband, hagen, similarly, in, demanding, that, gunther, first, be, killed, before, he, reveals, the, hoard, s, location, even, though, the, hoard, is, at, the, bottom, of, the, rhine, and, cannot, be, retrieved, reveals, kriemhild, s, mercilessness, while, also, showing, his, own, duplicity, it, is, unclear, which, figure, is, in, the, right, and, which, in, the, wrong, with, 36, extant, manuscripts, the, nibelungenlied, appears, to, have, been, one, of, the, most, popular, works, of, the, german, middle, ages, and, seems, to, have, found, a, very, broad, audience, the, poem, is, quoted, by, wolfram, von, eschenbach, in, his, parzival, and, willehalm, and, likely, inspired, his, use, of, stanzas, in, his, unfinished, titurel, the, manuscript, witnesses, and, medieval, references, to, the, nibelungenlied, show, that, medieval, recipients, were, most, interested, in, the, nibelungenlied, as, the, story, of, the, destruction, of, the, burgundians, the, first, half, of, the, poem, was, often, shortened, or, otherwise, summarized, the, ambraser, heldenbuch, titles, its, copy, of, the, nibelungenlied, with, ditz, puech, heysset, chrimhilt, this, book, is, named, kriemhild, showing, that, she, was, seen, as, the, most, important, character, the, areas, of, medieval, interest, seem, in, particular, to, have, been, the, inescapability, of, the, slaughter, at, the, end, of, the, poem, and, kriemhild, and, hagen, s, culpability, or, innocence, the, earliest, attested, reception, of, the, nibelungenlied, the, nibelungenklage, which, was, likely, written, only, shortly, afterwards, shows, an, attempt, both, to, make, sense, of, the, horror, of, the, destruction, and, to, absolve, kriemhild, of, blame, the, c, version, of, the, nibelungenlied, redacted, around, the, same, time, as, the, klage, shows, a, similar, strategy, the, presence, of, the, nibelungenklage, in, all, manuscripts, of, the, nibelungenlied, shows, that, the, ending, of, the, nibelungenlied, itself, was, evidently, unsatisfying, to, its, primary, audience, without, some, attempt, to, explain, these, two, scandalous, elements, the, rosengarten, zu, worms, on, the, other, hand, demonizes, kriemhild, thoroughly, while, the, late, medieval, lied, vom, h, rnen, seyfrid, takes, her, side, even, more, strongly, as, the, first, middle, high, german, heroic, poem, to, be, written, the, nibelungenlied, can, be, said, to, have, founded, an, entire, genre, of, middle, high, german, literature, as, a, result, other, middle, high, german, heroic, poems, are, sometimes, described, as, post, nibelungian, nachnibelungisch, the, majority, of, these, epics, revolve, around, the, hero, dietrich, von, bern, who, plays, a, secondary, role, in, the, nibelungenlied, it, is, likely, that, his, presence, there, inspired, these, new, poems, many, of, the, following, heroic, epics, appear, to, respond, to, aspects, of, the, nibelungenlied, the, kudrun, c, 1250, for, instance, has, been, described, as, a, reply, to, the, nibelungenlied, that, reverses, the, heroic, tragedy, of, the, previous, poem, kudrun, herself, is, sometimes, seen, as, a, direct, reversal, of, kriemhild, as, she, makes, peace, among, warring, factions, rather, than, driving, them, to, their, deaths, no, middle, high, german, heroic, epic, after, the, nibelungenlied, maintains, the, tragic, heroic, atmosphere, that, characterized, earlier, germanic, heroic, poetry, and, the, later, poems, are, often, further, hybridized, with, elements, of, chivalric, romance, reception, of, the, nibelungenlied, ceases, after, the, fifteenth, century, the, work, is, last, copied, in, manuscript, as, part, of, the, ambraser, heldenbuch, around, 1508, and, its, last, mention, is, by, the, viennese, historian, wolfgang, lazius, in, two, works, from, 1554, and, 1557, respectively, it, was, not, printed, and, appears, to, have, been, forgotten, the, nibelungen, saga, however, was, not, forgotten, completely, the, rosengarten, zu, worms, was, printed, as, part, of, the, printed, heldenbuch, until, 1590, and, inspired, several, plays, in, the, early, seventeenth, century, while, h, rnen, seyfrid, continued, to, be, printed, into, the, nineteenth, century, in, a, prose, version, after, having, been, forgotten, for, two, hundred, years, the, nibelungenlied, manuscript, c, was, rediscovered, by, jacob, hermann, obereit, in, 1755, that, same, year, johann, jacob, bodmer, publicized, the, discovery, publishing, excerpts, and, his, own, reworkings, of, the, poem, bodmer, dubbed, the, nibelungenlied, the, german, iliad, deutsche, ilias, a, comparison, that, skewed, the, reception, of, the, poem, by, comparing, it, to, the, poetics, of, a, classical, epic, bodmer, attempted, to, make, the, nibelungenlied, conform, more, closely, to, these, principles, in, his, own, reworkings, of, the, poem, leaving, off, the, first, part, in, his, edition, titled, chriemhilden, rache, in, order, to, imitate, the, in, medias, res, technique, of, homer, he, later, rewrote, the, second, part, in, dactylic, hexameter, under, the, title, die, rache, der, schwester, 1767, bodmer, s, placement, of, the, nibelungenlied, in, the, tradition, of, classical, epic, had, a, detrimental, effect, on, its, early, reception, when, presented, with, a, full, edition, of, the, medieval, poem, by, christoph, heinrich, myller, king, frederick, ii, famously, called, the, nibelungenlied, not, worth, a, shot, of, powder, nicht, einen, schu, pulver, werth, goethe, was, similarly, unimpressed, and, hegel, compared, the, epic, unfavorably, to, homer, the, epic, nevertheless, had, its, supporters, such, as, august, wilhelm, schlegel, who, called, it, a, great, tragedy, gro, e, trag, die, in, a, series, of, lectures, from, 1802, 3, many, early, supporters, sought, to, distance, german, literature, from, french, classicism, and, belonged, to, artistic, movements, such, as, sturm, und, drang, as, a, consequence, of, the, comparison, of, the, nibelungenlied, to, the, iliad, the, nibelungenlied, came, to, be, seen, as, the, german, national, epic, in, the, earlier, nineteenth, century, particularly, in, the, context, of, the, napoleonic, wars, the, nibelungenlied, was, supposed, to, embody, german, bourgeois, virtues, that, the, french, were, seen, as, lacking, this, interpretation, of, the, epic, continued, during, the, biedermeier, period, during, which, the, heroic, elements, of, the, poem, were, mostly, ignored, in, favor, of, those, that, could, more, easily, be, integrated, into, a, bourgeois, understanding, of, german, virtue, the, translation, of, the, nibelungenlied, by, karl, simrock, into, modern, german, in, 1827, was, especially, influential, in, popularizing, the, epic, and, remains, influential, today, also, notable, from, this, period, is, the, three, part, dramatic, tragedy, die, nibelungen, by, friedrich, hebbel, following, the, founding, of, the, german, empire, recipients, began, to, focus, more, on, the, heroic, aspects, of, the, poem, with, the, figure, of, siegfried, in, particular, becoming, an, identifying, figure, for, german, nationalism, especially, important, for, this, new, understanding, of, the, poem, was, richard, wagner, s, operatic, cycle, der, ring, des, nibelungen, which, however, was, based, almost, entirely, on, the, old, norse, versions, of, the, nibelung, saga, wagner, s, preference, for, the, old, norse, versions, followed, a, popular, judgment, of, the, time, period, the, nordic, versions, were, seen, as, being, more, original, than, the, courtly, story, portrayed, in, the, german, poem, in, the, first, world, war, the, alliance, between, germany, and, austria, hungary, came, to, be, described, as, possessing, nibelungen, treue, nibelungen, loyalty, referring, to, the, loyalty, to, death, between, hagen, and, the, burgundians, while, militaristic, the, use, of, imagery, from, the, nibelungenlied, remained, optimistic, in, this, period, rather, than, focusing, on, the, doom, at, the, end, of, the, epic, the, interwar, period, saw, the, nibelungenlied, enter, the, world, of, cinema, in, fritz, lang, s, two, part, film, die, nibelungen, 1924, 1925, which, tells, the, entire, story, of, the, poem, at, the, same, time, the, nibelungenlied, was, heavily, employed, in, anti, democratic, propaganda, following, the, defeat, of, germany, and, austria, hungary, the, epic, supposedly, showed, that, the, german, people, were, more, well, suited, to, a, heroic, aristocratic, form, of, life, than, democracy, the, betrayal, and, murder, of, siegfried, was, explicitly, compared, to, the, stab, in, the, back, that, the, german, army, had, supposedly, received, at, the, same, time, hagen, and, his, willingness, to, sacrifice, himself, and, fight, to, the, death, made, him, into, a, central, figure, in, the, reception, of, the, poem, during, the, second, world, war, hermann, g, ring, would, explicitly, use, this, aspect, of, the, nibelungenlied, to, celebrate, the, sacrifice, of, the, german, army, at, stalingrad, and, compare, the, soviets, to, etzel, s, asiatic, huns, postwar, reception, and, adaptation, of, the, poem, reacting, to, its, misuse, by, the, nazis, is, often, parodic, at, the, same, time, the, poem, continues, to, play, a, role, in, regional, culture, and, history, particularly, in, worms, and, other, places, mentioned, in, the, nibelungenlied, much, discussion, has, centered, on, whether, and, how, the, epic, ought, to, be, taught, in, schools, the, material, of, the, nibelungen, saga, has, continued, to, inspire, new, adaptations, these, include, die, nibelungen, a, german, remake, of, fritz, lang, s, film, from, 1966, 67, and, the, television, film, dark, kingdom, the, dragon, king, from, 2004, however, the, majority, of, popular, adaptations, of, the, material, today, in, film, computer, games, comic, books, etc, are, not, based, on, the, medieval, epic, directly, outside, of, germany, most, reception, of, the, nibelungen, material, has, taken, place, via, wagner, although, the, epic, has, been, translated, into, english, numerous, times, in, chronological, order
