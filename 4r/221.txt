escapes, to, tillingham, in, essex, as, london, and, southern, england, is, invaded, by, martians, it, is, one, of, the, most, commented, on, works, in, the, science, fiction, canon, the, plot, is, similar, to, other, works, of, invasion, literature, from, the, same, period, and, has, been, variously, interpreted, as, a, commentary, on, the, theory, of, evolution, imperialism, and, victorian, era, fears, superstitions, and, prejudices, wells, later, noted, that, inspiration, for, the, plot, was, the, catastrophic, effect, of, european, colonisation, on, the, aboriginal, tasmanians, some, historians, have, argued, that, wells, wrote, the, book, to, encourage, his, readership, to, question, the, morality, of, imperialism, at, the, time, of, publication, it, was, classified, as, a, scientific, romance, like, wells, s, earlier, novel, the, time, machine, the, war, of, the, worlds, has, never, been, out, of, print, it, spawned, numerous, feature, films, radio, dramas, a, record, album, comic, book, adaptations, television, series, and, sequels, or, parallel, stories, by, other, authors, it, was, dramatised, in, a, 1938, radio, programme, directed, by, and, starring, orson, welles, that, reportedly, caused, panic, among, listeners, who, did, not, know, that, the, events, were, fictional, the, novel, even, influenced, the, work, of, scientists, robert, h, goddard, was, inspired, by, the, book, and, helped, develop, both, the, liquid, fuelled, rocket, and, multistage, rocket, which, resulted, in, the, apollo, 11, moon, landing, 71, years, later, yet, across, the, gulf, of, space, minds, that, are, to, our, minds, as, ours, are, to, those, of, the, beasts, that, perish, intellects, vast, and, cool, and, unsympathetic, regarded, this, earth, with, envious, eyes, and, slowly, and, surely, drew, their, plans, against, us, the, novel, opens, in, the, mid, 1890s, with, aliens, on, mars, plotting, an, invasion, of, earth, after, consuming, the, natural, resources, of, their, home, world, the, main, narrative, the, great, disillusionment, takes, place, in, the, early, 20th, century, in, the, summer, when, an, object, thought, to, be, a, meteor, lands, on, horsell, common, near, the, narrator, s, home, it, turns, out, to, be, an, artificial, cylinder, that, was, launched, towards, earth, several, months, earlier, as, earth, and, mars, approached, opposition, several, martians, emerge, and, appear, to, struggle, with, earth, s, gravity, and, unfamiliar, atmosphere, when, a, human, delegation, approaches, the, cylinder, waving, a, white, flag, the, martians, incinerate, them, using, a, heat, ray, the, crowd, flees, and, that, evening, a, large, military, force, surrounds, the, cylinder, the, next, day, the, narrator, takes, his, wife, to, safety, in, leatherhead, by, means, of, a, dog, cart, rented, from, the, local, pub, landlord, but, then, turns, back, so, he, can, return, it, that, night, he, sees, a, three, legged, martian, fighting, machine, tripod, armed, with, a, heat, ray, and, a, chemical, weapon, the, poisonous, black, smoke, tripods, have, wiped, out, the, human, soldiers, around, the, cylinder, and, destroyed, most, of, woking, the, narrator, approaches, his, own, house, and, finds, the, landlord, dead, in, the, front, garden, from, inhaling, black, smoke, while, keeping, watch, from, an, upper, floor, window, he, offers, shelter, to, an, artilleryman, who, has, fled, after, his, company, was, wiped, out, attacking, the, cylinder, the, narrator, and, the, artilleryman, try, to, escape, back, towards, leatherhead, but, are, separated, during, a, martian, attack, between, shepperton, and, weybridge, as, refugees, try, to, cross, the, river, wey, the, army, is, able, to, destroy, a, tripod, with, concentrated, artillery, fire, and, the, martians, retreat, the, narrator, travels, to, walton, where, he, meets, an, unnamed, curate, the, martians, attack, again, and, people, begin, to, flee, london, including, the, narrator, s, brother, who, travels, with, his, neighbor, mrs, elphinstone, and, her, sister, in, law, to, keep, them, safe, they, reach, the, coast, and, buy, passage, to, continental, europe, on, a, makeshift, fleet, of, refugee, ships, tripods, attack, but, a, torpedo, ram, hms, thunder, child, destroys, two, of, them, before, being, destroyed, itself, a, third, is, either, destroyed, in, the, detonation, of, the, ship, s, ammunition, stores, or, flees, unseen, in, the, resultant, smoke, and, the, evacuation, fleet, escapes, soon, all, organised, resistance, collapses, and, martians, roam, the, shattered, landscape, unhindered, at, the, beginning, of, book, two, the, narrator, and, the, curate, witness, a, martian, machine, seizing, people, and, tossing, them, into, a, metal, carrier, the, narrator, realises, that, the, martian, invaders, may, have, plans, for, their, victims, when, a, fifth, martian, cylinder, lands, both, men, are, trapped, beneath, the, ruins, of, a, manor, house, the, narrator, learns, from, his, observations, how, martian, anatomy, works, and, how, they, use, living, creatures, blood, to, nourish, themselves, the, two, men, s, relationship, deteriorates, as, the, curate, slowly, falls, into, despair, and, when, he, tries, to, eat, their, remaining, food, supplies, the, narrator, knocks, him, unconscious, a, passing, martian, removes, the, curate, s, body, but, the, narrator, escapes, detection, the, martians, abandon, the, cylinder, s, crater, and, the, narrator, emerges, from, the, collapsed, house, and, heads, for, west, london, en, route, he, finds, martian, red, weed, everywhere, prickly, vegetation, spreading, wherever, there, is, abundant, water, but, notices, that, it, is, slowly, dying, on, putney, heath, he, encounters, the, artilleryman, again, but, soon, abandons, him, when, the, man, tries, to, convince, him, that, they, should, keep, fighting, the, martians, driven, mad, by, his, trauma, he, finally, attempts, suicide, by, approaching, a, stationary, fighting, machine, on, primrose, hill, to, his, surprise, he, discovers, that, all, the, martians, have, been, killed, by, an, onslaught, of, earthly, pathogens, to, which, they, had, no, immunity, the, narrator, suffers, a, nervous, breakdown, and, is, nursed, back, to, health, by, a, kind, family, eventually, he, returns, to, woking, and, discovers, that, his, wife, has, survived, in, the, last, chapter, he, reflects, on, the, martian, invasion, its, impact, on, humanity, s, view, of, itself, and, the, future, and, the, effect, it, has, had, on, his, mind, the, war, of, the, worlds, presents, itself, as, a, factual, account, of, the, martian, invasion, it, is, considered, one, of, the, first, works, to, theorise, the, existence, of, a, race, intelligent, enough, to, invade, earth, the, narrator, is, a, middle, class, writer, of, philosophical, papers, reminiscent, of, doctor, kemp, in, the, invisible, man, with, characteristics, similar, to, author, wells, at, the, time, of, writing, the, reader, learns, little, about, the, background, of, the, narrator, or, indeed, of, anyone, else, in, the, novel, characterisation, is, unimportant, in, fact, few, of, the, principal, characters, are, named, aside, from, the, astronomer, ogilvy, and, miss, and, mrs, elphinstone, wells, was, trained, as, a, science, teacher, during, the, latter, half, of, the, 1880s, one, of, his, teachers, was, thomas, henry, huxley, a, major, advocate, of, darwinism, wells, later, taught, science, and, his, first, book, was, a, biology, textbook, much, of, his, work, makes, contemporary, ideas, of, science, and, technology, easily, understandable, the, scientific, fascinations, of, the, novel, are, established, in, the, opening, chapter, the, narrator, views, mars, through, a, telescope, and, wells, offers, the, image, of, the, superior, martians, having, observed, human, affairs, as, though, watching, tiny, organisms, through, a, microscope, in, august, 1894, a, french, astronomer, reported, sightings, of, a, strange, light, on, mars, wells, used, this, observation, to, open, the, novel, imagining, these, lights, to, be, the, launching, of, the, martian, cylinders, toward, earth, italian, astronomer, giovanni, schiaparelli, observed, features, on, mars, in, 1878, which, he, called, canali, italian, for, channels, in, 1895, american, astronomer, percival, lowell, speculated, in, his, book, mars, that, these, might, be, irrigation, channels, constructed, by, a, sentient, life, form, to, support, existence, on, an, arid, dying, world, the, novel, also, explores, ideas, related, to, charles, darwin, s, theory, of, natural, selection, in, 1896, wells, published, an, essay, on, intelligence, on, mars, in, the, saturday, review, setting, out, ideas, about, life, on, mars, wells, speculates, on, the, nature, of, martian, inhabitants, and, how, their, evolutionary, progress, might, compare, to, humans, these, ideas, are, used, almost, unchanged, in, the, war, of, the, worlds, wells, has, also, imagined, how, life, could, evolve, in, hostile, conditions, like, those, on, mars, the, creatures, have, no, digestive, system, no, appendages, except, tentacles, and, put, the, blood, of, other, beings, in, their, veins, to, survive, wells, was, writing, some, years, before, karl, landsteiner, discovered, the, three, human, blood, groups, o, a, and, b, and, showed, the, challenges, of, even, transfusing, blood, between, humans, with, incompatible, blood, groups, in, 1895, wells, married, catherine, robbins, and, moved, with, her, to, woking, in, surrey, there, he, spent, his, mornings, walking, or, cycling, in, the, countryside, and, his, afternoons, writing, the, original, idea, for, the, war, of, the, worlds, came, from, his, brother, during, one, of, these, walks, pondering, on, what, it, might, be, like, if, alien, beings, were, suddenly, to, descend, on, the, scene, a, 23, feet, 7, 0, m, high, sculpture, of, a, tripod, fighting, machine, entitled, the, woking, martian, based, on, descriptions, in, the, novel, stands, in, crown, passage, close, to, the, local, railway, station, in, woking, designed, and, constructed, in, 1998, by, artist, michael, condron, fifty, meters, further, up, the, pedestrianised, street, is, a, concrete, and, brick, representation, of, a, martian, cylinder, wells, s, depiction, of, late, victorian, suburban, culture, in, the, novel, was, an, accurate, representation, of, his, own, experiences, at, the, time, in, the, late, 19th, century, the, british, empire, was, the, predominant, colonial, power, on, the, globe, making, its, domestic, heart, a, poignant, and, terrifying, starting, point, for, an, invasion, by, martians, with, their, own, imperialist, agenda, wells, also, drew, on, a, common, fear, that, emerged, in, the, years, approaching, the, turn, of, the, century, known, as, the, fin, de, si, cle, or, end, of, the, age, which, anticipated, an, apocalypse, occurring, at, midnight, on, the, last, day, of, 1899, in, the, late, 1890s, it, was, common, for, novels, to, be, serialised, in, magazines, or, newspapers, before, publication, in, full, with, each, part, of, the, serialisation, ending, on, a, cliffhanger, to, entice, audiences, to, buy, the, next, issue, this, practice, was, familiar, from, charles, dickens, s, novels, earlier, in, the, nineteenth, century, the, war, of, the, worlds, was, first, serialised, in, the, united, kingdom, in, pearson, s, magazine, from, april, to, december, 1897, wells, was, paid, 200, and, pearsons, demanded, to, know, the, ending, of, the, piece, before, committing, to, publish, the, complete, volume, was, first, published, by, heinemann, in, 1898, and, has, been, in, print, ever, since, two, unauthorised, serialisations, of, the, novel, were, published, in, the, united, states, prior, to, publication, of, the, novel, the, first, was, in, the, new, york, evening, journal, where, the, story, was, published, as, fighters, from, mars, or, the, war, of, the, worlds, located, in, a, new, york, setting, between, december, 1897, and, january, 1898, the, second, version, had, the, martians, landing, near, and, around, boston, and, was, published, by, the, boston, post, as, fighters, from, mars, or, the, war, of, the, worlds, in, and, near, boston, in, 1898, even, though, these, versions, are, considered, unauthorised, hughes, and, geduld, speculate, that, wells, may, inadvertently, have, agreed, to, the, serialisation, in, the, new, york, evening, journal, these, two, versions, of, the, story, were, followed, by, edison, s, conquest, of, mars, by, garrett, p, serviss, holt, rinehart, winston, reprinted, the, book, in, 2000, paired, with, the, time, machine, and, commissioned, michael, koelsch, to, illustrate, a, new, cover, the, war, of, the, worlds, was, received, favourably, by, both, readers, and, critics, the, illustrated, london, news, wrote, that, the, serialisation, in, pearson, s, magazine, had, a, very, distinct, success, the, story, did, even, better, as, a, book, and, reviewers, rated, it, as, the, very, best, work, he, has, yet, produced, and, highlighting, the, story, s, originality, in, showing, mars, in, a, new, light, through, the, concept, of, an, alien, invasion, of, earth, writing, for, harper, s, weekly, sidney, brooks, admired, wells, s, writing, style, he, has, complete, check, over, his, imagination, and, makes, it, effective, by, turning, his, most, horrible, of, fancies, into, the, language, of, the, simplest, least, startling, denomination, praising, wells, s, power, of, vivid, realization, the, daily, news, reviewer, wrote, the, imagination, the, extraordinary, power, of, presentation, the, moral, significance, of, the, book, cannot, be, contested, there, was, however, some, criticism, of, the, brutal, nature, of, the, events, in, the, narrative, between, 1871, and, 1914, more, than, 60, works, of, fiction, for, adult, readers, describing, invasions, of, great, britain, were, published, the, original, work, was, the, battle, of, dorking, 1871, by, george, tomkyns, chesney, which, portrays, a, surprise, german, attack, and, landing, on, the, south, coast, of, england, made, possible, by, the, distraction, of, the, royal, navy, in, colonial, patrols, and, the, army, in, an, irish, insurrection, the, german, army, makes, short, work, of, english, militia, and, rapidly, marches, to, london, this, story, was, published, in, blackwood, s, magazine, in, may, 1871, and, was, so, popular, that, it, was, reprinted, a, month, later, as, a, pamphlet, which, sold, 80, 000, copies, there, are, clear, plot, similarities, between, wells, s, book, and, the, battle, of, dorking, in, both, a, ruthless, enemy, makes, a, devastating, surprise, attack, with, the, british, armed, forces, helpless, to, stop, its, relentless, advance, and, both, involve, the, destruction, of, the, home, counties, of, southern, england, however, the, war, of, the, worlds, transcends, the, typical, fascination, of, invasion, literature, with, european, politics, and, international, disputes, with, its, introduction, of, an, alien, adversary, the, invasion, literature, genre, provided, a, familiar, base, from, which, to, support, the, success, of, the, war, of, the, worlds, it, may, also, have, proved, an, important, foundation, for, wells, s, ideas, as, he, had, never, seen, or, fought, in, a, war, many, novels, focusing, on, life, on, other, planets, written, close, to, 1900, echo, scientific, ideas, of, the, time, including, pierre, simon, laplace, s, nebular, hypothesis, charles, darwin, s, scientific, theory, of, natural, selection, and, gustav, kirchhoff, s, theory, of, spectroscopy, these, ideas, combined, to, present, the, possibility, that, planets, are, alike, in, composition, and, conditions, for, the, development, of, species, which, would, likely, lead, to, the, emergence, of, life, at, a, suitable, geological, age, in, a, planet, s, development, by, the, time, wells, wrote, the, war, of, the, worlds, there, had, been, three, centuries, of, observation, of, mars, through, telescopes, galileo, observed, the, planet, s, phases, in, 1610, and, in, 1666, giovanni, cassini, identified, the, polar, ice, caps, in, 1878, italian, astronomer, giovanni, schiaparelli, observed, geological, features, which, he, called, canali, italian, for, channels, this, was, mistranslated, into, english, as, canals, which, being, artificial, watercourses, fuelled, the, belief, in, intelligent, extraterrestrial, life, on, the, planet, this, influenced, american, astronomer, percival, lowell, in, 1895, lowell, s, book, mars, speculated, about, an, arid, dying, landscape, whose, inhabitants, built, canals, to, bring, water, from, the, polar, caps, to, irrigate, the, remaining, arable, land, this, encapsulated, contemporary, scientific, ideas, about, conditions, on, the, red, planet, at, the, time, the, war, of, the, worlds, was, written, ideas, which, persisted, until, they, were, tested, by, space, missions, starting, with, the, viking, program, that, found, a, lifeless, world, too, cold, for, liquid, water, to, exist, the, martians, travel, to, the, earth, in, cylinders, apparently, fired, from, a, huge, space, gun, on, the, surface, of, mars, this, was, a, common, representation, of, space, travel, in, the, nineteenth, century, and, had, also, been, used, by, jules, verne, in, from, the, earth, to, the, moon, modern, scientific, understanding, renders, this, idea, impractical, as, it, would, be, difficult, to, control, the, trajectory, of, the, gun, precisely, and, the, force, of, the, explosion, necessary, to, propel, the, cylinder, from, the, martian, surface, to, the, earth, would, likely, kill, the, occupants, however, there, has, been, renewed, interest, in, this, type, of, launch, system, in, recent, years, with, several, space, agencies, conducting, feasibility, studies, into, space, gun, type, launch, system, particularly, the, use, of, electromagnetic, rail, gun, technology, the, 16, year, old, robert, h, goddard, was, inspired, by, the, story, and, spent, much, of, his, life, building, rockets, the, work, of, the, german, rocket, scientists, hermann, oberth, and, his, student, wernher, von, braun, led, to, the, v, 2, rocket, becoming, the, first, artificial, object, to, travel, into, space, by, crossing, the, k, rm, n, line, on, 20, june, 1944, and, rocket, developments, culminated, in, the, apollo, program, s, human, landing, on, the, moon, and, the, landing, of, robotic, probes, on, mars, the, martian, invasion, s, principal, weapons, are, the, heat, ray, and, the, poisonous, black, smoke, their, strategy, includes, the, destruction, of, infrastructure, such, as, armament, stores, railways, and, telegraph, lines, it, appears, to, be, intended, to, cause, maximum, casualties, leaving, humans, without, any, will, to, resist, these, tactics, became, more, common, as, the, twentieth, century, progressed, particularly, during, the, 1930s, with, the, development, of, mobile, weapons, and, technology, capable, of, surgical, strikes, on, key, military, and, civilian, targets, wells, s, vision, of, a, war, bringing, total, destruction, without, moral, limitations, in, the, war, of, the, worlds, was, not, taken, seriously, by, readers, at, the, time, of, publication, he, later, expanded, these, ideas, in, the, novels, when, the, sleeper, wakes, 1899, the, war, in, the, air, 1908, and, the, world, set, free, 1914, this, kind, of, total, war, did, not, become, fully, realised, until, the, second, world, war, critic, howard, black, wrote, that, in, concrete, details, the, martian, fighting, machines, as, depicted, by, wells, have, nothing, in, common, with, tanks, or, dive, bombers, but, the, tactical, and, strategic, use, made, of, them, is, strikingly, reminiscent, of, blitzkrieg, as, it, would, be, developed, by, the, german, armed, forces, four, decades, later, the, description, of, the, martians, advancing, inexorably, at, lightning, speed, towards, london, the, british, army, completely, unable, to, put, up, an, effective, resistance, the, british, government, disintegrating, and, evacuating, the, capital, the, mass, of, terrified, refugees, clogging, the, roads, all, were, to, be, precisely, enacted, in, real, life, at, 1940, france, black, regarded, this, 1898, depiction, as, far, closer, to, the, actual, land, fighting, of, world, war, ii, than, wells, s, much, later, work, the, shape, of, things, to, come, 1933, wells, s, description, of, chemical, weapons, the, black, smoke, used, by, the, martian, fighting, machines, to, kill, human, beings, in, great, numbers, became, a, reality, in, world, war, i, the, comparison, between, lasers, and, the, heat, ray, was, made, as, early, as, the, later, half, of, the, 1950s, when, lasers, were, still, in, development, prototypes, of, mobile, laser, weapons, have, been, developed, and, are, being, researched, and, tested, as, a, possible, future, weapon, in, space, military, theorists, of, the, era, including, those, of, the, royal, navy, prior, to, the, first, world, war, had, speculated, about, building, a, fighting, machine, or, a, land, dreadnought, wells, later, further, explored, the, ideas, of, an, armoured, fighting, vehicle, in, his, short, story, the, land, ironclads, there, is, a, high, level, of, science, fiction, abstraction, in, wells, s, description, of, martian, automotive, technology, he, stresses, how, martian, machinery, is, devoid, of, wheels, they, use, a, complicated, system, of, sliding, parts, to, produce, movement, possess, multiple, whip, like, tentacles, for, grasping, and, paralleling, animal, motion, quasi, muscles, abounded, in, the, crablike, handling, machine, h, g, wells, was, a, student, of, thomas, henry, huxley, a, proponent, of, the, theory, of, natural, selection, in, the, novel, the, conflict, between, humankind, and, the, martians, is, portrayed, as, a, survival, of, the, fittest, with, the, martians, whose, longer, period, of, successful, evolution, on, the, older, mars, has, led, to, them, developing, a, superior, intelligence, able, to, create, weapons, far, in, advance, of, humans, on, the, younger, planet, earth, who, have, not, had, the, opportunity, to, develop, sufficient, intelligence, to, construct, similar, weapons, the, novel, also, suggests, a, potential, future, for, human, evolution, and, perhaps, a, warning, against, overvaluing, intelligence, against, more, human, qualities, the, narrator, describes, the, martians, as, having, evolved, an, overdeveloped, brain, which, has, left, them, with, cumbersome, bodies, with, increased, intelligence, but, a, diminished, ability, to, use, their, emotions, something, wells, attributes, to, bodily, function, the, narrator, refers, to, an, 1893, publication, suggesting, that, the, evolution, of, the, human, brain, might, outstrip, the, development, of, the, body, and, organs, such, as, the, stomach, nose, teeth, and, hair, would, wither, leaving, humans, as, thinking, machines, needing, mechanical, devices, much, like, the, tripod, fighting, machines, to, be, able, to, interact, with, their, environment, this, publication, is, probably, wells, s, own, the, man, of, the, year, million, first, published, in, the, pall, mall, gazette, on, 6, november, 1893, which, suggests, similar, ideas, at, the, time, of, the, novel, s, publication, the, british, empire, consisted, of, roughly, a, quarter, of, the, world, s, territories, and, a, relative, period, of, peace, known, as, the, pax, britannica, existed, between, the, great, powers, of, the, western, world, between, 1815, and, 1914, around, 26, 000, 000, square, kilometres, 10, 000, 000, sq, mi, of, territory, and, roughly, 400, million, people, were, added, to, the, british, empire, while, invasion, literature, had, provided, an, imaginative, foundation, for, the, idea, of, the, heart, of, the, british, empire, being, conquered, by, foreign, forces, it, was, not, until, the, war, of, the, worlds, that, the, british, public, was, presented, with, an, adversary, completely, superior, to, themselves, a, significant, motivating, force, behind, the, success, of, the, british, empire, was, its, use, of, sophisticated, technology, the, martians, also, attempting, to, establish, an, empire, on, earth, have, technology, superior, to, their, british, adversaries, in, the, war, of, the, worlds, wells, depicted, an, imperial, power, as, the, victim, of, imperial, aggression, and, thus, perhaps, encouraging, the, reader, to, consider, the, morality, of, imperialism, itself, wells, suggests, this, idea, in, the, following, passage, and, before, we, judge, them, too, harshly, we, must, remember, what, ruthless, and, utter, destruction, our, own, species, has, wrought, not, only, upon, animals, such, as, the, vanished, bison, and, the, dodo, but, upon, its, own, inferior, races, the,
