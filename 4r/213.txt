place, in, the, fictional, village, of, iguedo, which, is, in, the, umuofia, clan, the, place, name, iguedo, is, only, mentioned, three, times, in, the, novel, achebe, more, frequently, uses, the, name, umuofia, to, refer, to, okonkwo, s, home, village, of, iguedo, umuofia, is, located, west, of, the, actual, city, of, onitsha, on, the, east, bank, of, the, niger, river, in, nigeria, the, events, of, the, novel, unfold, in, the, 1890s, the, culture, depicted, that, of, the, igbo, people, is, similar, to, that, of, achebe, s, birthplace, of, ogidi, where, igbo, speaking, people, lived, together, in, groups, of, independent, villages, ruled, by, titled, elders, the, customs, described, in, the, novel, mirror, those, of, the, actual, onitsha, people, who, lived, near, ogidi, and, with, whom, achebe, was, familiar, within, forty, years, of, the, colonization, of, nigeria, by, the, time, achebe, was, born, in, 1930, the, missionaries, were, well, established, he, was, influenced, by, western, culture, but, he, refused, to, change, his, igbo, name, chinua, to, albert, achebe, s, father, isaiah, was, among, the, first, to, be, converted, in, ogidi, around, the, turn, of, the, century, isaiah, achebe, himself, was, an, orphan, raised, by, his, grandfather, his, grandfather, far, from, opposing, isaiah, s, conversion, to, christianity, allowed, his, christian, marriage, to, be, celebrated, in, his, compound, achebe, wrote, his, novels, in, english, because, he, felt, that, the, written, standard, igbo, language, was, stilted, which, he, connected, to, the, fact, that, the, standard, was, deliberately, created, by, combining, various, dialects, in, a, 1994, interview, with, the, paris, review, achebe, said, the, novel, form, seems, to, go, with, the, english, language, there, is, a, problem, with, the, igbo, language, it, suffers, from, a, very, serious, inheritance, which, it, received, at, the, beginning, of, this, century, from, the, anglican, mission, they, sent, out, a, missionary, by, the, name, of, dennis, archdeacon, dennis, he, was, a, scholar, he, had, this, notion, that, the, igbo, language, which, had, very, many, different, dialects, should, somehow, manufacture, a, uniform, dialect, that, would, be, used, in, writing, to, avoid, all, these, different, dialects, because, the, missionaries, were, powerful, what, they, wanted, to, do, they, did, this, became, the, law, but, the, standard, version, cannot, sing, there, s, nothing, you, can, do, with, it, to, make, it, sing, it, s, heavy, it, s, wooden, it, doesn, t, go, anywhere, achebe, s, choice, to, write, in, english, has, caused, controversy, while, both, african, and, non, african, critics, agree, that, achebe, modelled, things, fall, apart, on, classic, european, literature, they, disagree, about, whether, his, novel, upholds, a, western, model, or, in, fact, subverts, or, confronts, it, achebe, continued, to, defend, his, decision, english, is, something, you, spend, your, lifetime, acquiring, so, it, would, be, foolish, not, to, use, it, also, in, the, logic, of, colonization, and, decolonization, it, is, actually, a, very, powerful, weapon, in, the, fight, to, regain, what, was, yours, english, was, the, language, of, colonization, itself, it, is, not, simply, something, you, use, because, you, have, it, anyway, achebe, is, noted, for, his, inclusion, of, and, weaving, in, of, proverbs, from, igbo, oral, culture, into, his, writing, this, influence, was, explicitly, referenced, by, achebe, in, things, fall, apart, among, the, igbo, the, art, of, conversation, is, regarded, very, highly, and, proverbs, are, the, palm, oil, with, which, words, are, eaten, the, novel, s, protagonist, okonkwo, is, famous, in, the, villages, of, umuofia, for, being, a, wrestling, champion, okonkwo, is, strong, hard, working, and, strives, to, show, no, weakness, or, fear, he, is, characterized, as, being, starkly, different, from, his, father, unoka, who, had, been, a, debtor, unable, to, support, his, wife, or, children, and, who, preferred, playing, his, flute, over, conflict, okonkwo, therefore, works, to, build, his,

throughout, africa, it, is, studied, widely, in, europe, india, and, north, america, where, it, has, spawned, numerous, secondary, and, tertiary, analytical, works, it, has, achieved, similar, status,

courses, across, the, world, achebe, is, now, considered, to, be, the, essential, novelist, on, african, identity, nationalism, and, decolonization, achebe, s, main, focus, has, been, cultural, ambiguity, and, contestation, the, complexity, of, novels, such, as, things, fall, apart, depends, on, achebe, s, ability, to, bring, competing, cultural, systems, and, their, languages, to, the, same, level, of, representation, dialogue, and, contestation, reviewers, have, praised, achebe, s, neutral, narration, and, have, described, things, fall, apart, as, a, realistic, novel, much, of, the, critical, discussion, about, things, fall, apart, concentrates, on, the, socio, political, aspects, of, the, novel, including, the, friction, between, the, members, of, igbo, society, as, they, confront, the, intrusive, and, overpowering, presence, of, western, government, and, beliefs, ernest, n, emenyonu, commented, that, things, fall, apart, is, indeed, a, classic, study, of, cross, cultural, misunderstanding, and, the, consequences, to, the, rest, of, humanity, when, a, belligerent, culture, or, civilization, out, of, sheer, arrogance, and, ethnocentrism, takes, it, upon, itself, to, invade, another, culture, another, civilization, achebe, s, writing, about, african, society, in, telling, from, an, african, point, of, view, the, story, of, the, colonization, of, the, igbo, was, noted, at, its, publication, in, europe, and, america, to, help, combat, the, systemic, western, misconception, that, african, culture, was, savage, and, primitive, in, things, fall, apart, western, culture, is, portrayed, as, being, arrogant, and, ethnocentric, insisting, that, the, african, culture, needed, a, leader, as, it, had, no, kings, or, chiefs, umuofian, culture, was, vulnerable, to, invasion, by, western, civilization, it, is, felt, that, the, repression, of, the, igbo, language, at, the, end, of, the, novel, contributes, greatly, to, the, destruction, of, the, culture, although, achebe, favours, the, african, culture, of, the, pre, western, society, the, author, attributes, its, destruction, to, the, weaknesses, within, the, native, structure, achebe, portrays, the, culture, as, having, a, religion, a, government, a, system, of, money, and, an, artistic, tradition, as, well, as, a, judicial, system, the, publication, of, achebe, s, things, fall, apart, helped, pave, the, way, for, numerous, other, african, writers, novelists, who, published, after, achebe, were, able, to, find, an, eloquent, and, effective, mode, for, the, expression, of, the, particular, social, historical, and, cultural, situation, of, modern, africa, before, things, fall, apart, was, published, most, of, the, novels, about, africa, had, been, written, by, european, authors, portraying, africans, as, savages, who, were, in, need, of, western, enlightenment, achebe, broke, from, this, outsider, view, by, portraying, igbo, society, in, a, sympathetic, light, this, allows, the, reader, to, examine, the, effects, of, european, colonialism, from, a, different, perspective, he, commented, the, popularity, of, things, fall, apart, in, my, own, society, can, be, explained, simply, this, was, the, first, time, we, were, seeing, ourselves, as, autonomous, individuals, rather, than, half, people, or, as, conrad, would, say, rudimentary, souls, nigerian, nobel, laureate, wole, soyinka, has, described, the, work, as, the, first, novel, in, english, which, spoke, from, the, interior, of, the, african, character, rather, than, portraying, the, african, as, an, exotic, as, the, white, man, would, see, him, the, language, of, the, novel, has, not, only, intrigued, critics, but, has, also, been, a, major, factor, in, the, emergence, of, the, modern, african, novel, because, achebe, wrote, in, english, portrayed, igbo, life, from, the, point, of, view, of, an, african, man, and, used, the, language, of, his, people, he, was, able, to, greatly, influence, african, novelists, who, viewed, him, as, a, mentor, achebe, s, fiction, and, criticism, continue, to, inspire, and, influence, writers, around, the, world, hilary, mantel, the, booker, prize,
