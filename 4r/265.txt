https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_General_Theory_of_Employment,_Interest_and_Money
the, general, theory, of, employment, interest, and, money, is, a, book, by, english, economist, john, maynard, keynes, published, in, february, 1936, it, caused, a, profound, shift, in, economic, thought, giving, macroeconomics, a, central, place, in, economic, theory, and, contributing, much, of, its, terminology, the, keynesian, revolution, it, had, equally, powerful, consequences, in, economic, policy, being, interpreted, as, providing, theoretical, support, for, government, spending, in, general, and, for, budgetary, deficits, monetary, intervention, and, counter, cyclical, policies, in, particular, it, is, pervaded, with, an, air, of, mistrust, for, the, rationality, of, free, market, decision, making, keynes, denied, that, an, economy, would, automatically, adapt, to, provide, full, employment, even, in, equilibrium, and, believed, that, the, volatile, and, ungovernable, psychology, of, markets, would, lead, to, periodic, booms, and, crises, the, general, theory, is, a, sustained, attack, on, the, classical, economics, orthodoxy, of, its, time, it, introduced, the, concepts, of, the, consumption, function, the, principle, of, effective, demand, and, liquidity, preference, and, gave, new, prominence, to, the, multiplier, and, the, marginal, efficiency, of, capital, the, central, argument, of, the, general, theory, is, that, the, level, of, employment, is, determined, not, by, the, price, of, labour, as, in, classical, economics, but, by, the, level, of, aggregate, demand, if, the, total, demand, for, goods, at, full, employment, is, less, than, the, total, output, then, the, economy, has, to, contract, until, equality, is, achieved, keynes, thus, denied, that, full, employment, was, the, natural, result, of, competitive, markets, in, equilibrium, in, this, he, challenged, the, conventional, classical, economic, wisdom, of, his, day, in, a, letter, to, his, friend, george, bernard, shaw, on, new, year, s, day, 1935, he, wrote, i, believe, myself, to, be, writing, a, book, on, economic, theory, which, will, largely, revolutionize, not, i, suppose, at, once, but, in, the, course, of, the, next, ten, years, the, way, the, world, thinks, about, its, economic, problems, i, can, t, expect, you, or, anyone, else, to, believe, this, at, the, present, stage, but, for, myself, i, don, t, merely, hope, what, i, say, in, my, own, mind, i, m, quite, sure, the, first, chapter, of, the, general, theory, only, half, a, page, long, has, a, similarly, radical, tone, i, have, called, this, book, the, general, theory, of, employment, interest, and, money, placing, the, emphasis, on, the, prefix, general, the, object, of, such, a, title, is, to, contrast, the, character, of, my, arguments, and, conclusions, with, those, of, the, classical, theory, of, the, subject, upon, which, i, was, brought, up, and, which, dominates, the, economic, thought, both, practical, and, theoretical, of, the, governing, and, academic, classes, of, this, generation, as, it, has, for, a, hundred, years, past, i, shall, argue, that, the, postulates, of, the, classical, theory, are, applicable, to, a, special, case, only, and, not, to, the, general, case, the, situation, which, it, assumes, being, a, limiting, point, of, the, possible, positions, of, equilibrium, moreover, the, characteristics, of, the, special, case, assumed, by, the, classical, theory, happen, not, to, be, those, of, the, economic, society, in, which, we, actually, live, with, the, result, that, its, teaching, is, misleading, and, disastrous, if, we, attempt, to, apply, it, to, the, facts, of, experience, keynes, s, main, theory, including, its, dynamic, elements, is, presented, in, chapters, 2, 15, 18, and, 22, which, are, summarised, here, a, shorter, account, will, be, found, in, the, article, on, keynesian, economics, the, remaining, chapters, of, keynes, s, book, contain, amplifications, of, various, sorts, and, are, described, later, in, this, article, the, first, book, of, the, general, theory, of, employment, interest, and, money, is, a, repudiation, of, say, s, law, the, classical, view, for, which, keynes, made, say, a, mouthpiece, held, that, the, value, of, wages, was, equal, to, the, value, of, the, goods, produced, and, that, the, wages, were, inevitably, put, back, into, the, economy, sustaining, demand, at, the, level, of, current, production, hence, starting, from, full, employment, there, cannot, be, a, glut, of, industrial, output, leading, to, a, loss, of, jobs, as, keynes, put, it, on, p, 18, supply, creates, its, own, demand, say, s, law, depends, on, the, operation, of, a, market, economy, if, there, is, unemployment, and, if, there, are, no, distortions, preventing, the, employment, market, from, adjusting, to, it, then, there, will, be, workers, willing, to, offer, their, labour, at, less, than, the, current, wage, levels, leading, to, downward, pressure, on, wages, and, increased, offers, of, jobs, the, classics, held, that, full, employment, was, the, equilibrium, condition, of, an, undistorted, labour, market, but, they, and, keynes, agreed, in, the, existence, of, distortions, impeding, transition, to, equilibrium, the, classical, position, had, generally, been, to, view, the, distortions, as, the, culprit, and, to, argue, that, their, removal, was, the, main, tool, for, eliminating, unemployment, keynes, on, the, other, hand, viewed, the, market, distortions, as, part, of, the, economic, fabric, and, advocated, different, policy, measures, which, as, a, separate, consideration, had, social, consequences, which, he, personally, found, congenial, and, which, he, expected, his, readers, to, see, in, the, same, light, the, distortions, which, have, prevented, wage, levels, from, adapting, downwards, have, lain, in, employment, contracts, being, expressed, in, monetary, terms, in, various, forms, of, legislation, such, as, the, minimum, wage, and, in, state, supplied, benefits, in, the, unwillingness, of, workers, to, accept, reductions, in, their, income, and, in, their, ability, through, unionisation, to, resist, the, market, forces, exerting, downward, pressure, on, them, keynes, accepted, the, classical, relation, between, wages, and, the, marginal, productivity, of, labour, referring, to, it, on, page, 5, as, the, first, postulate, of, classical, economics, and, summarising, it, as, saying, that, the, wage, is, equal, to, the, marginal, product, of, labour, the, first, postulate, can, be, expressed, in, the, equation, y, n, w, p, where, y, n, is, the, real, output, when, employment, is, n, and, w, and, p, are, the, wage, rate, and, price, rate, in, money, terms, and, hence, w, p, is, the, wage, rate, in, real, terms, a, system, can, be, analysed, on, the, assumption, that, w, is, fixed, i, e, that, wages, are, fixed, in, money, terms, or, that, w, p, is, fixed, i, e, that, they, are, fixed, in, real, terms, or, that, n, is, fixed, e, g, if, wages, adapt, to, ensure, full, employment, all, three, assumptions, had, at, times, been, made, by, classical, economists, but, under, the, assumption, of, wages, fixed, in, money, terms, the, first, postulate, becomes, an, equation, in, two, variables, n, and, p, and, the, consequences, of, this, had, not, been, taken, into, account, by, the, classical, school, keynes, proposed, a, second, postulate, of, classical, economics, asserting, that, the, wage, is, equal, to, the, marginal, disutility, of, labour, this, is, an, instance, of, wages, being, fixed, in, real, terms, he, attributes, the, second, postulate, to, the, classics, subject, to, the, qualification, that, unemployment, may, result, from, wages, being, fixed, by, legislation, collective, bargaining, or, mere, human, obstinacy, p6, all, of, which, are, likely, to, fix, wages, in, money, terms, keynes, s, economic, theory, is, based, on, the, interaction, between, demands, for, saving, investment, and, liquidity, i, e, money, saving, and, investment, are, necessarily, equal, but, different, factors, influence, decisions, concerning, them, the, desire, to, save, in, keynes, s, analysis, is, mostly, a, function, of, income, the, wealthier, people, are, the, more, wealth, they, will, seek, to, put, aside, the, profitability, of, investment, on, the, other, hand, is, determined, by, the, relation, between, the, return, available, to, capital, and, the, interest, rate, the, economy, needs, to, find, its, way, to, an, equilibrium, in, which, no, more, money, is, being, saved, than, will, be, invested, and, this, can, be, accomplished, by, contraction, of, income, and, a, consequent, reduction, in, the, level, of, employment, in, the, classical, scheme, it, is, the, interest, rate, rather, than, income, which, adjusts, to, maintain, equilibrium, between, saving, and, investment, but, keynes, asserts, that, the, rate, of, interest, already, performs, another, function, in, the, economy, that, of, equating, demand, and, supply, of, money, and, that, it, cannot, adjust, to, maintain, two, separate, equilibria, in, his, view, it, is, the, monetary, role, which, wins, out, this, is, why, keynes, s, theory, is, a, theory, of, money, as, much, as, of, employment, the, monetary, economy, of, interest, and, liquidity, interacts, with, the, real, economy, of, production, investment, and, consumption, keynes, sought, to, allow, for, the, lack, of, downwards, flexibility, of, wages, by, constructing, an, economic, model, in, which, the, money, supply, and, wage, rates, were, externally, determined, the, latter, in, money, terms, and, in, which, the, main, variables, were, fixed, by, the, equilibrium, conditions, of, various, markets, in, the, presence, of, these, facts, many, of, the, quantities, of, interest, such, as, income, and, consumption, are, monetary, keynes, often, expresses, such, quantities, in, wage, units, chapter, 4, to, be, precise, a, value, in, wage, units, is, equal, to, its, price, in, money, terms, divided, by, w, the, wage, in, money, units, per, man, hour, of, labour, therefore, it, is, a, unit, expressed, in, hours, of, labour, keynes, generally, writes, a, subscript, w, on, quantities, expressed, in, wage, units, but, in, this, account, we, omit, the, w, when, occasionally, we, use, real, terms, for, a, value, which, keynes, expresses, in, wage, units, we, write, it, in, lower, case, e, g, y, rather, than, y, as, a, result, of, keynes, s, choice, of, units, the, assumption, of, sticky, wages, though, important, to, the, argument, is, largely, invisible, in, the, reasoning, if, we, want, to, know, how, a, change, in, the, wage, rate, would, influence, the, economy, keynes, tells, us, on, p, 266, that, the, effect, is, the, same, as, that, of, an, opposite, change, in, the, money, supply, the, key, notion, of, expectations, is, introduced, in, chapter, 5, short, term, expectations, are, concerned, with, the, price, which, a, manufacturer, can, expect, to, get, for, his, finished, output, at, the, time, when, he, commits, himself, sic, to, starting, the, process, which, will, produce, it, long, term, expectation, is, concerned, with, what, the, entrepreneur, can, hope, to, earn, in, the, shape, of, future, returns, if, he, sic, purchases, or, perhaps, manufactures, finished, output, as, an, addition, to, his, capital, equipment, keynes, note, that, it, is, sensible, for, producers, to, base, their, expectations, on, the, assumption, that, the, most, recently, realized, results, will, continue, except, in, so, far, as, there, are, definite, reasons, for, expecting, a, change, however, see, chapter, 12, long, term, expectations, are, liable, to, sudden, revision, thus, the, factor, of, long, term, expectations, cannot, be, even, approximately, eliminated, or, replaced, by, realized, results, briefly, short, run, expectations, are, typically, mathematical, in, character, long, run, expectations, less, so, the, relationship, between, saving, and, investment, and, the, factors, influencing, their, demands, play, an, important, role, in, keynes, s, model, saving, and, investment, are, considered, to, be, necessarily, equal, for, reasons, set, out, in, chapter, 6, which, looks, at, economic, aggregates, from, the, viewpoint, of, manufacturers, the, discussion, is, intricate, considering, matters, such, as, the, depreciation, of, machinery, but, is, summarised, on, p, 63, provided, it, is, agreed, that, income, is, equal, to, the, value, of, current, output, that, current, investment, is, equal, to, the, value, of, that, part, of, current, output, which, is, not, consumed, and, that, saving, is, equal, to, the, excess, of, income, over, consumption, the, equality, of, saving, and, investment, necessarily, follows, this, statement, incorporates, keynes, s, definition, of, saving, which, is, the, normal, one, book, iii, of, the, general, theory, is, given, over, to, the, propensity, to, consume, which, is, introduced, in, chapter, 8, as, the, desired, level, of, expenditure, on, consumption, for, an, individual, or, aggregated, over, an, economy, the, demand, for, consumer, goods, depends, chiefly, on, the, income, y, and, may, be, written, functionally, as, c, y, saving, is, that, part, of, income, which, is, not, consumed, so, the, propensity, to, save, s, y, is, equal, to, y, c, y, keynes, discusses, the, possible, influence, of, the, interest, rate, r, on, the, relative, attractiveness, of, saving, and, consumption, but, regards, it, as, complex, and, uncertain, and, leaves, it, out, as, a, parameter, his, seemingly, innocent, definitions, embody, an, assumption, whose, consequences, will, be, considered, later, since, y, is, measured, in, wage, units, the, proportion, of, income, saved, is, considered, to, be, unaffected, by, the, change, in, real, income, resulting, from, a, change, in, the, price, level, while, wages, stay, fixed, keynes, acknowledges, that, this, is, undesirable, in, point, 1, of, section, ii, in, chapter, 9, he, provides, a, homiletic, enumeration, of, the, motives, to, consume, or, not, to, do, so, finding, them, to, lie, in, social, and, psychological, considerations, which, can, be, expected, to, be, relatively, stable, but, which, may, be, influenced, by, objective, factors, such, as, changes, in, expectations, of, the, relation, between, the, present, and, the, future, level, of, income, p95, the, marginal, propensity, to, consume, c, y, is, the, gradient, of, the, purple, curve, and, the, marginal, propensity, to, save, s, y, is, equal, to, 1, c, y, keynes, states, as, a, fundamental, psychological, law, p96, that, the, marginal, propensity, to, consume, will, be, positive, and, less, than, unity, chapter, 10, introduces, the, famous, multiplier, through, an, example, if, the, marginal, propensity, to, consume, is, 90, then, the, multiplier, k, is, 10, and, the, total, employment, caused, by, e, g, increased, public, works, will, be, ten, times, the, employment, caused, by, the, public, works, themselves, pp116f, formally, keynes, writes, the, multiplier, as, k, 1, s, y, it, follows, from, his, fundamental, psychological, law, that, k, will, be, greater, than, 1, keynes, s, account, is, not, clear, until, his, economic, system, has, been, fully, set, out, see, below, in, chapter, 10, he, describes, his, multiplier, as, being, related, to, the, one, introduced, by, r, f, kahn, in, 1931, the, mechanism, of, kahn, s, multiplier, lies, in, an, infinite, series, of, transactions, each, conceived, of, as, creating, employment, if, you, spend, a, certain, amount, of, money, then, the, recipient, will, spend, a, proportion, of, what, he, or, she, receives, the, second, recipient, will, spend, a, further, proportion, again, and, so, forth, keynes, s, account, of, his, own, mechanism, in, the, second, para, of, p, 117, makes, no, reference, to, infinite, series, by, the, end, of, the, chapter, on, the, multiplier, he, uses, his, much, quoted, digging, holes, metaphor, against, laissez, faire, in, his, provocation, keynes, argues, that, if, the, treasury, were, to, fill, old, bottles, with, banknotes, bury, them, at, suitable, depths, in, disused, coalmines, which, are, then, filled, up, to, the, surface, with, town, rubbish, and, leave, it, to, private, enterprise, on, well, tried, principles, of, laissez, faire, to, dig, the, banknotes, up, again, there, need, be, no, more, unemployment, and, with, the, help, of, the, repercussions, the, real, income, of, the, community, and, its, capital, wealth, also, would, probably, become, a, good, deal, greater, than, it, actually, is, it, would, indeed, be, more, sensible, to, build, houses, and, the, like, but, if, there, are, political, and, practical, difficulties, in, the, way, of, this, the, above, would, be, better, than, nothing, book, iv, discusses, the, inducement, to, invest, with, the, key, ideas, being, presented, in, chapter, 11, the, marginal, efficiency, of, capital, is, defined, as, the, annual, revenue, which, is, expected, to, be, yielded, by, an, extra, increment, of, capital, as, a, proportion, of, its, cost, the, schedule, of, the, marginal, efficiency, of, capital, is, the, function, which, for, any, rate, of, interest, r, gives, us, the, level, of, investment, which, will, take, place, if, all, opportunities, are, accepted, whose, return, is, at, least, r, by, construction, this, depends, on, r, alone, and, is, a, decreasing, function, of, its, argument, it, is, illustrated, in, the, diagram, and, we, shall, write, it, as, i, r, this, schedule, is, a, characteristic, of, the, current, industrial, process, which, irving, fisher, described, as, representing, the, investment, opportunity, side, of, interest, theory, and, in, fact, the, condition, that, it, should, equal, s, y, r, is, the, equation, which, determines, the, interest, rate, from, income, in, classical, theory, keynes, is, seeking, to, reverse, the, direction, of, causality, and, omitting, r, as, an, argument, to, s, he, interprets, the, schedule, as, expressing, the, demand, for, investment, at, any, given, value, of, r, giving, it, an, alternative, name, we, shall, call, this, the, investment, demand, schedule, p136, he, also, refers, to, it, as, the, demand, curve, for, capital, p178, for, fixed, industrial, conditions, we, conclude, that, the, amount, of, investment, depends, on, the, rate, of, interest, as, john, hicks, put, it, in, mr, keynes, and, the, classics, in, chapter, 12, keynes, writes, it, would, be, foolish, in, forming, our, expectations, to, attach, great, weight, to, matters, which, are, very, uncertain, it, is, reasonable, therefore, to, be, guided, to, a, considerable, degree, by, the, facts, about, which, we, feel, somewhat, confident, even, though, they, may, be, less, decisively, relevant, to, the, issue, than, other, facts, about, which, our, knowledge, is, vague, and, scanty, for, this, reason, the, facts, of, the, existing, situation, enter, in, a, sense, disproportionately, into, the, formation, of, our, long, term, expectations, our, usual, practice, being, to, take, the, existing, situation, and, to, project, it, into, the, future, modified, only, to, the, extent, that, we, have, more, or, less, definite, reasons, for, expecting, a, change, he, goes, on, thus, in, practice, we, have, tacitly, agreed, as, a, rule, to, fall, back, on, what, is, in, truth, a, convention, he, notes, that, our, existing, knowledge, does, not, provide, a, sufficient, basis, for, a, calculated, mathematical, expectation, nevertheless, the, above, conventional, method, of, calculation, will, be, compatible, with, a, considerable, measure, of, continuity, and, stability, in, our, affairs, so, long, as, we, can, rely, on, the, maintenance, of, the, convention, he, notes, a, practical, problem, speculators, may, do, no, harm, as, bubbles, on, a, steady, stream, of, enterprise, but, the, position, is, serious, when, enterprise, becomes, the, bubble, on, a, whirlpool, of, speculation, he, suggests, that, the, introduction, of, a, substantial, government, transfer, tax, on, all, transactions, might, prove, the, most, serviceable, reform, available, with, a, view, to, mitigating, the, predominance, of, speculation, over, enterprise, in, the, united, states, to, account, for, the, apparent, foolishness, on, which, economic, progress, seemed, to, rely, keynes, suggests, that, most, probably, of, our, decisions, to, do, something, positive, the, full, consequences, of, which, will, be, drawn, out, over, many, days, to, come, can, only, be, taken, as, a, result, of, animal, spirits, of, a, spontaneous, urge, to, action, rather, than, inaction, and, not, as, the, outcome, of, a, weighted, average, of, quantitative, benefits, multiplied, by, quantitative, probabilities, keynes, proposes, two, theories, of, liquidity, preference, i, e, the, demand, for, money, the, first, as, a, theory, of, interest, in, chapter, 13, and, the, second, as, a, correction, in, chapter, 15, his, arguments, offer, ample, scope, for, criticism, but, his, final, conclusion, is, that, liquidity, preference, is, a, function, mainly, of, income, and, the, interest, rate, the, influence, of, income, which, really, represents, a, composite, of, income, and, wealth, is, common, ground, with, the, classical, tradition, and, is, embodied, in, the, quantity, theory, the, influence, of, interest, had, also, been, noted, earlier, in, particular, by, frederick, lavington, see, hicks, s, mr, keynes, and, the, classics, thus, keynes, s, final, conclusion, may, be, acceptable, to, readers, who, question, the, arguments, along, the, way, however, he, shows, a, persistent, tendency, to, think, in, terms, of, the, chapter, 13, theory, while, nominally, accepting, the, chapter, 15, correction, chapter, 13, presents, the, first, theory, in, rather, metaphysical, terms, keynes, argues, that, it, should, be, obvious, that, the, rate, of, interest, cannot, be, a, return, to, saving, or, waiting, as, such, for, if, a, man, hoards, his, savings, in, cash, he, earns, no, interest, though, he, saves, just, as, much, as, before, on, the, contrary, the, mere, definition, of, the, rate, of, interest, tells, us, in, so, many, words, that, the, rate, of, interest, is, the, reward, for, parting, with, liquidity, for, a, specified, period, to, which, jacob, viner, retorted, that, by, analogous, reasoning, he, could, deny, that, wages, are, the, reward, for, labor, or, that, profit, is, the, reward, for, risk, taking, because, labor, is, sometimes, done, without, anticipation, or, realization, of, a, return, and, men, who, assume, financial, risks, have, been, known, to, incur, losses, as, a, result, instead, of, profits, keynes, goes, on, to, claim, that, the, demand, for, money, is, a, function, of, the, interest, rate, alone, on, the, grounds, that, the, rate, of, interest, is, the, price, which, equilibrates, the, desire, to, hold, wealth, in, the, form, of, cash, with, the, available, quantity, of, cash, frank, knight, commented, that, this, seems, to, assume, that, demand, is, simply, an, inverse, function, of, price, the, upshot, from, these, reasonings, is, that, liquidity, preference, is, a, potentiality, or, functional, tendency, which, fixes, the, quantity, of, money, which, the, public, will, hold, when, the, rate, of, interest, is, given, so, that, if, r, is, the, rate, of, interest, m, the, quantity, of, money, and, l, the, function, of, liquidity, preference, we, have, m, l, r, this, is, where, and, how, the, quantity, of, money, enters, into, the, economic, scheme, and, specifically, it, determines, the, rate, of, interest, which, therefore, cannot, be, determined, by, the, traditional, factors, of, productivity, and, thrift, chapter, 15, looks, in, more, detail, at, the, three, motives, keynes, ascribes, for, the, holding, of, money, the, transactions, motive, the, precautionary, motive, and, the, speculative, motive, he, considers, that, demand, arising, from, the, first, two, motives, mainly, depends, on, the, level, of, income, p199, while, the, interest, rate, is, likely, to, be, a, minor, factor, p196, keynes, treats, the, speculative, demand, for, money, as, a, function, of, r, alone, without, justifying, its, independence, of, income, he, says, that, what, matters, is, not, the, absolute, level, of, r, but, the, degree, of, its, divergence, from, what, is, considered, a, fairly, safe, level, but, gives, reasons, to, suppose, that, demand, will, nonetheless, tend, to, decrease, as, r, increases, he, thus, writes, liquidity, preference, in, the, form, l, 1, y, l, 2, r, where, l, 1, is, the, sum, of, transaction, and, precautionary, demands, and, l, 2, measures, speculative, demand, the, structure, of, keynes, s, expression, plays, no, part, in, his, subsequent, theory, so, it, does, no, harm, to, follow, hicks, by, writing, liquidity, preference, simply, as, l, y, r, the, quantity, of, money, as, determined, by, the, action, of, the, central, bank, is, taken, as, given, i, e, exogenous, p, 247, and, constant, because, hoarding, is, ruled, out, on, page, 174, by, the, fact, that, the, necessary, expansion, of, the, money, supply, cannot, be, determined, by, the, public, keynes, does, not, put, a, subscript, w, on, l, or, m, implying, that, we, should, think, of, them, in, money, terms, this, suggestion, is, reinforced, by, his, wording, on, page, 172, where, he, says, unless, we, measure, liquidity, preference, in, terms, of, wage, units, which, is, convenient, in, some, contexts, but, seventy, pages, later, there, is, a, fairly, clear, statement, that, liquidity, preference, and, the, quantity, of, money, are, indeed, measured, in, terms, of, wage, units, p246, in, chapter, 14, keynes, contrasts, the, classical, theory, of, interest, with, his, own, and, in, making, the, comparison, he, shows, how, his, system, can, be, applied, to, explain, all, the, principal, economic, unknowns, from, the, facts, he, takes, as, given, the, two, topics, can, be, treated, together, because, they, are, different, ways, of, analysing, the, same, equation, keynes, s, presentation, is, informal, to, make, it, more, precise, we, will, identify, a, set, of, 4, variables, saving, investment, the, rate, of, interest, and, the, national, income, and, a, parallel, set, of, 4, equations, which, jointly, determine, them, the, graph, illustrates, the, reasoning, the, red, s, lines, are, shown, as, increasing, functions, of, r, in, obedience, to, classical, theory, for, keynes, they, should, be, horizontal, the, first, equation, asserts, that, the, reigning, rate, of, interest, r, is, determined, from, the, amount, of, money, in, circulation, m, through, the, liquidity, preference, function, and, the, assumption, that, l, r, m, the, second, equation, fixes, the, level, of, investment, i, given, the, rate, of, interest, through, the, schedule, of, the, marginal, efficiency, of, capital, as, i, r, the, third, equation, tells, us, that, saving, is, equal, to, investment, s, y, i, the, final, equation, tells, us, that, the, income, y, is, the, value, of, y, corresponding, to, the, implied, level, of, saving, all, this, makes, a, satisfying, theoretical, system, three, comments, can, be, made, concerning, the, argument, firstly, no, use, is, made, of, the, first, postulate, of, classical, economics, which, can, be, called, on, later, to, set, the, price, level, secondly, hicks, in, mr, keynes, and, the, classics, presents, his, version, of, keynes, s, system, with, a, single, variable, representing, both, saving, and, investment, so, his, exposition, has, three, equations, in, three, unknowns, and, finally, since, keynes, s, discussion, takes, place, in, chapter, 14, it, precedes, the, modification, which, makes, liquidity, preference, depend, on, income, as, well, as, on, the, rate, of, interest, once, this, modification, has, been, made, the, unknowns, can, no, longer, be, recovered, sequentially, the, state, of, the, economy, according, to, keynes, is, determined, by, four, parameters, the, money, supply, the, demand, functions, for, consumption, or, equivalently, for, saving, and, for, liquidity, and, the, schedule, of, the, marginal, efficiency, of, capital, determined, by, the, existing, quantity, of, equipment, and, the, state, of, long, term, expectation, p246, adjusting, the, money, supply, is, the, domain, of, monetary, policy, the, effect, of, a, change, in, the, quantity, of, money, is, considered, at, p, 298, the, change, is, effected, in, the, first, place, in, money, units, according, to, keynes, s, account, on, p, 295, wages, will, not, change, if, there, is, any, unemployment, with, the, result, that, the, money, supply, will, change, to, the, same, extent, in, wage, units, we, can, then, analyse, its, effect, from, the, diagram, in, which, we, see, that, an, increase, in, m, shifts, r, to, the, left, pushing, i, upwards, and, leading, to, an, increase, in, total, income, and, employment, whose, size, depends, on, the, gradients, of, all, 3, demand, functions, if, we, look, at, the, change, in, income, as, a, function, of, the, upwards, shift, of, the, schedule, of, the, marginal, efficiency, of, capital, blue, curve, we, see, that, as, the, level, of, investment, is, increased, by, one, unit, the, income, must, adjust, so, that, the, level, of, saving, red, curve, is, one, unit, greater, and, hence, the, increase, in, income, must, be, 1, s, y, units, i, e, k, units, this, is, the, explanation, of, keynes, s, multiplier, it, does, not, necessarily, follow, that, individual, decisions, to, invest, will, have, a, similar, effect, since, decisions, to, invest, above, the, level, suggested, by, the, schedule, of, the, marginal, efficiency, of, capital, are, not, the, same, thing, as, an, increase, in, the, schedule, keynes, s, initial, statement, of, his, economic, model, in, chapter, 14, is, based, on, his, chapter, 13, theory, of, liquidity, preference, his, restatement, in, chapter, 18, doesn, t, take, full, account, of, his, chapter, 15, revision, treating, it, as, a, source, of, repercussions, rather, than, as, an, integral, component, it, was, left, to, john, hicks, to, give, a, satisfactory, presentation, equilibrium, between, supply, and, demand, of, money, depends, on, two, variables, interest, rate, and, income, and, these, are, the, same, two, variables, as, are, related, by, the, equation, between, the, propensity, to, save, and, the, schedule, of, the, marginal, efficiency, of, capital, it, follows, that, neither, equation, can, be, solved, in, isolation, and, that, they, need, to, be, considered, simultaneously, the, first, postulate, of, classical, economics, was, also, accepted, as, valid, by, keynes, though, not, used, in, the, first, four, books, of, the, general, theory, the, keynesian, system, can, thus, be, represented, by, three, equations, in, three, variables, as, shown, below, roughly, following, hicks, three, analogous, equations, can, be, given, for, classical, economics, as, presented, below, they, are, in, forms, given, by, keynes, himself, the, practice, of, writing, r, as, an, argument, to, v, derives, from, his, treatise, on, money, here, y, is, written, as, a, function, of, n, the, number, of, workers, employed, p, is, the, price, in, money, terms, of, a, unit, of, real, output, v, r, is, the, velocity, of, money, and, w, is, the, wage, rate, in, money, terms, n, p, and, r, are, the, 3, variables, we, need, to, recover, in, the, keynesian, system, income, is, measured, in, wage, units, and, is, therefore, not, a, function, of, the, level, of, employment, alone, since, it, will, also, vary, with, prices, the, first, postulate, assumes, that, prices, can, be, represented, by, a, single, variable, strictly, it, should, be, modified, to, take, account, of, the, distinction, between, marginal, wage, cost, and, marginal, prime, cost, the, classics, took, the, second, equation, as, determining, the, rate, of, interest, the, third, as, determining, the, price, level, and, the, first, as, determining, employment, keynes, believed, that, the, last, two, equations, could, be, solved, together, for, y, and, r, which, is, not, possible, in, the, classical, system, he, accordingly, concentrated, on, these, two, equations, treating, income, as, almost, the, same, thing, as, employment, on, p, 247, here, we, see, the, benefit, he, has, gained, by, simplifying, the, form, of, the, consumption, function, if, he, had, written, it, slightly, more, accurately, as, c, y, p, w, then, he, would, have, needed, to, bring, in, the, first, equation, to, get, a, solution, if, we, wish, to, examine, the, classical, system, our, task, is, made, easier, if, we, assume, that, the, effect, of, the, interest, rate, on, the, velocity, of, circulation, is, small, enough, to, be, ignored, this, allows, us, to, treat, v, as, constant, and, solve, the, first, and, third, equations, the, first, postulate, and, the, quantity, theory, together, leaving, the, second, equation, to, determine, the, interest, rate, from, the, result, we, then, find, that, the, level, of, employment, is, given, by, the, formula, y, n, y, n, w, m, v, displaystyle, frac, y, n, y, n, frac, w, hat, m, v, the, graph, shows, the, numerator, and, denominator, of, the, left, hand, side, as, blue, and, green, curves, their, ratio, the, pink, curve, will, be, a, decreasing, function, of, n, even, if, we, don, t, assume, diminishing, marginal, returns, the, level, of, employment, n, is, given, by, the, horizontal, position, at, which, the, pink, curve, has, a, value, of, w, m, v, displaystyle, w, hat, m, v, and, this, is, evidently, a, decreasing, function, of, w, the, theoretical, system, we, have, described, is, developed, over, chapters, 4, 18, and, is, anticipated, by, a, chapter, which, interprets, keynesian, unemployment, in, terms, of, aggregate, demand, the, aggregate, supply, z, is, the, total, value, of, output, when, n, workers, are, employed, written, functionally, as, n, the, aggregate, demand, d, is, manufacturers, expected, proceeds, written, as, f, n, in, equilibrium, z, d, d, can, be, decomposed, as, d, 1, d, 2, where, d, 1, is, the, propensity, to, consume, which, may, be, written, c, y, or, n, d, 2, is, explained, as, the, volume, of, investment, and, the, equilibrium, condition, determining, the, level, of, employment, is, that, d, 1, d, 2, should, equal, z, as, functions, of, n, d, 2, can, be, identified, with, i, r, the, meaning, of, this, is, that, in, equilibrium, the, total, demand, for, goods, must, equal, total, income, total, demand, for, goods, is, the, sum, of, demand, for, consumption, goods, and, demand, for, investment, goods, hence, y, c, y, s, y, c, y, i, r, and, this, equation, determines, a, unique, value, of, y, given, r, samuelson, s, keynesian, cross, is, a, graphical, representation, of, the, chapter, 3, argument, chapter, 5, makes, some, common, sense, observations, on, the, role, of, expectation, in, economics, short, term, expectations, govern, the, level, of, production, chosen, by, an, entrepreneur, while, long, term, expectations, govern, decisions, to, adjust, the, level, of, capitalisation, keynes, describes, the, process, by, which, the, level, of, employment, adapts, to, a, change, in, long, term, expectations, and, remarks, that, the, level, of, employment, at, any, time, depends, not, merely, on, the, existing, state, of, expectation, but, on, the, states, of, expectation, which, have, existed, over, a, certain, past, period, nevertheless, past, expectations, which, have, not, yet, worked, themselves, out, are, embodied, in, to, day, s, capital, equipment, and, only, influence, decisions, in, so, far, as, they, are, so, embodied, the, main, role, of, expectation, in, keynes, s, theory, lies, in, the, schedule, of, the, marginal, efficiency, of, capital, which, as, we, have, seen, is, defined, in, chapter, 11, in, terms, of, expected, returns, keynes, differs, here, from, fisher, whom, he, largely, follows, but, who, defined, the, rate, of, return, over, cost, in, terms, of, an, actual, revenue, stream, rather, than, its, expectation, the, step, keynes, took, here, has, a, particular, significance, in, his, theory, keynes, differed, from, his, classical, predecessors, in, assigning, a, role, to, the, schedule, of, the, marginal, efficiency, of, capital, in, determining, the, level, of, employment, its, effect, is, mentioned, in, his, presentations, of, his, theory, in, chapters, 14, and, 18, see, above, chapter, 12, discusses, the, psychology, of, speculation, and, enterprise, most, probably, of, our, decisions, to, do, something, positive, can, only, be, taken, as, a, result, of, animal, spirits, thus, if, the, animal, spirits, are, dimmed, and, spontaneous, optimism, falters, leaving, us, to, depend, on, nothing, but, a, mathematical, expectation, enterprise, will, fade, and, die, keynes, s, picture, of, the, psychology, of, speculators, is, less, indulgent, in, point, of, fact, all, sorts, of, considerations, enter, into, the, market, valuation, which, are, in, no, way, relevant, to, the, prospective, yield, the, recurrence, of, a, bank, holiday, may, raise, the, market, valuation, of, the, british, railway, system, by, several, million, pounds, work, in, behavioural, economics, has, since, empirically, supported, keynes, assertion, businesses, which, are, extremely, seasonal, do, indeed, see, notably, higher, valuations, in, the, season, in, question, even, if, their, results, are, consistent, in, that, quarter, from, year, to, year, keynes, considers, speculators, to, be, concerned, not, with, what, an, investment, is, really, worth, to, a, man, who, buys, it, for, keeps, but, with, what, the, market, will, value, it, at, under, the, influence, of, mass, psychology, three, months, or, a, year, hence, this, battle, of, wits, to, anticipate, the, basis, of, conventional, valuation, a, few, months, hence, rather, than, the, prospective, yield, of, an, investment, over, a, long, term, of, years, does, not, even, require, gulls, amongst, the, public, to, feed, the, maws, of, the, professional, it, can, be, played, by, professionals, amongst, themselves, nor, is, it, necessary, that, anyone, should, keep, his, simple, faith, in, the, conventional, basis, of, valuation, having, any, genuine, long, term, validity, for, it, is, so, to, speak, a, game, of, snap, of, old, maid, of, musical, chairs, a, pastime, in, which, he, is, victor, who, says, snap, neither, too, soon, nor, too, late, who, passed, the, old, maid, to, his, neighbour, before, the, game, is, over, who, secures, a, chair, for, himself, when, the, music, stops, these, games, can, be, played, with, zest, and, enjoyment, though, all, the, players, know, that, it, is, the, old, maid, which, is, circulating, or, that, when, the, music, stops, some, of, the, players, will, find, themselves, unseated, or, to, change, the, metaphor, slightly, professional, investment, may, be, likened, to, those, newspaper, competitions, in, which, the, competitors, have, to, pick, out, the, six, prettiest, faces, from, a, hundred, photographs, the, prize, being, awarded, to, the, competitor, whose, choice, most, nearly, corresponds, to, the, average, preferences, of, the, competitors, as, a, whole, so, that, each, competitor, has, to, pick, not, those, faces, which, he, himself, finds, prettiest, but, those, which, he, thinks, likeliest, to, catch, the, fancy, of, the, other, competitors, all, of, whom, are, looking, at, the, problem, from, the, same, point, of, view, it, is, not, a, case, of, choosing, those, which, to, the, best, of, one, s, judgment, are, really, the, prettiest, nor, even, those, which, average, opinion, genuinely, thinks, the, prettiest, we, have, reached, the, third, degree, where, we, devote, our, intelligences, to, anticipating, what, average, opinion, expects, the, average, opinion, to, be, and, there, are, some, i, believe, who, practise, the, fourth, fifth, and, higher, degrees, keynes, s, theory, of, the, trade, cycle, is, a, theory, of, the, slow, oscillation, of, money, income, which, requires, it, to, be, possible, for, income, to, move, upwards, or, downwards, if, he, had, assumed, that, wages, were, constant, then, upward, motion, of, income, would, have, been, impossible, at, full, employment, and, he, would, have, needed, some, mechanism, to, frustrate, upward, pressure, if, it, arose, in, such, circumstances, his, task, is, made, easier, by, a, less, restrictive, but, nonetheless, crude, assumption, concerning, wage, behaviour, let, us, simplify, our, assumptions, still, further, and, assume, that, the, factors, of, production, are, content, with, the, same, money, wage, so, long, as, there, is, a, surplus, of, them, unemployed, whilst, as, soon, as, full, employment, is, reached, it, will, thenceforward, be, the, wage, unit, and, prices, which, will, increase, in, exact, proportion, to, the, increase, in, effective, demand, keynes, s, theory, of, the, trade, cycle, is, based, on, a, cyclical, change, in, the, marginal, efficiency, of, capital, induced, by, the, uncontrollable, and, disobedient, psychology, of, the, business, world, pp313, 317, the, marginal, efficiency, of, capital, depends, on, current, expectations, but, as, we, have, seen, the, basis, for, such, expectations, is, very, precarious, being, based, on, shifting, and, unreliable, evidence, they, are, subject, to, sudden, and, violent, changes, optimism, leads, to, a, rise, in, the, marginal, efficiency, of, capital, and, increased, investment, reflected, through, the, multiplier, in, an, even, greater, increase, in, income, until, disillusion, falls, upon, an, over, optimistic, and, over, bought, market, which, consequently, falls, with, sudden, and, even, catastrophic, force, p316, there, are, reasons, given, firstly, by, the, length, of, life, of, durable, assets, and, secondly, by, the, carrying, costs, of, surplus, stocks, why, the, duration, of, the, downward, movement, should, have, an, order, of, magnitude, between, let, us, say, three, and, five, years, and, a, half, cycle, of, 5, years, tallies, with, jevons, s, sunspot, cycle, length, of, 11, years, income, fluctuates, cyclically, in, keynes, s, theory, with, the, effect, being, borne, by, prices, if, income, increases, during, a, period, of, full, employment, and, by, employment, in, other, circumstances, keynes, s, assumption, about, wage, behaviour, has, been, the, subject, of, much, criticism, it, is, likely, that, wage, rates, adapt, partially, to, depression, conditions, with, the, consequence, that, effects, on, employment, are, weaker, than, his, model, implies, but, not, that, they, disappear, lerner, pointed, out, in, the, 40s, that, it, was, optimistic, to, hope, that, the, workforce, would, be, content, with, fixed, wages, in, the, presence, of, rising, prices, and, proposed, a, modification, to, keynes, s, model, after, this, a, succession, of, more, elaborate, models, were, constructed, many, associated, with, the, phillips, curve, keynes, s, optimistic, prediction, that, an, increase, in, money, supply, would, be, taken, up, by, an, increase, in, employment, led, to, jacob, viner, s, pessimistic, prediction, that, in, a, world, organized, in, accordance, with, keynes, specifications, there, would, be, a, constant, race, between, the, printing, press, and, the, business, agents, of, the, trade, unions, models, of, wage, pressure, on, the, economy, needed, frequent, correction, and, the, standing, of, keynesian, theory, suffered, geoff, tily, wrote, ruefully, finally, the, most, destructive, step, of, all, was, samuelson, s, and, solow, s, incorporation, of, the, phillips, curve, into, keynesian, theory, in, a, manner, which, traduced, not, only, phillips, but, also, keynes, s, careful, work, in, the, general, theory, chapter, 21, substituting, for, its, subtlety, an, immutable, relationship, between, inflation, and, employment, the, 1970s, combination, of, inflation, and, stagnating, economic, activity, was, at, odds, with, this, relationship, and, therefore, keynesianism, and, by, association, keynes, were, rejected, monetarism, was, merely, waiting, in, the, wings, for, this, to, happen, keynes, s, assumption, of, wage, behaviour, was, not, an, integral, part, of, his, theory, very, little, in, his, book, depends, on, it, and, was, avowedly, a, simplification, in, fact, it, was, the, simplest, assumption, he, could, make, without, imposing, an, unnatural, cap, on, money, income, keynes, drew, a, lot, of, help, from, his, students, in, his, progress, from, the, treatise, on, money, 1930, to, the, general, theory, 1936, the, cambridge, circus, a, discussion, group, founded, immediately, after, the, publication, of, the, earlier, work, reported, to, keynes, through, richard, kahn, and, drew, his, attention, to, a, supposed, fallacy, in, the, treatise, where, keynes, had, written, thus, profits, as, a, source, of, capital, increment, for, entrepreneurs, are, a, widow, s, cruse, which, remains, undepleted, however, much, of, them, may, be, devoted, to, riotous, living, the, circus, disbanded, in, may, 1931, but, three, of, its, member, kahn, austin, and, joan, robinson, continued, to, meet, in, the, robinsons, house, in, trumpington, st, cambridge, forwarding, comments, to, keynes, this, led, to, a, manifesto, of, 1932, whose, ideas, were, taken, up, by, keynes, in, his, lectures, kahn, and, joan, robinson, were, well, versed, in, marginalist, theory, which, keynes, did, not, fully, understand, at, the, time, or, possibly, ever, pushing, him, towards, adopting, elements, of, it, in, the, general, theory, during, 1934, and, 1935, keynes, submitted, drafts, to, kahn, robinson, and, roy, harrod, for, comment, there, has, been, uncertainty, ever, since, over, the, extent, of, the, collaboration, schumpeter, describing, kahn, s, share, in, the, historic, achievement, as, not, having, fallen, very, far, short, of, co, authorship, while, kahn, denied, the, attribution, keynes, s, method, of, writing, was, unusual, keynes, drafted, rapidly, in, pencil, reclining, in, an, armchair, the, pencil, draft, he, sent, straight, to, the, printers, they, supplied, him, with, a, considerable, number, of, galley, proofs, which, he, would, then, distribute, to, his, advisers, and, critics, for, comment, and, amendment, as, he, published, on, his, own, account, macmillan, co, the, publishers, in, reality, they, were, distributors, could, not, object, to, the, expense, of, keynes, method, of, operating, they, came, out, of, keynes, profit, macmillan, co, merely, received, a, commission, keynes, object, was, to, simplify, the, process, of, circulating, drafts, and, eventually, to, secure, good, sales, by, fixing, the, retail, price, lower, than, would, macmillan, co, the, advantages, of, self, publication, can, be, seen, from, tienne, mantoux, s, review, when, he, published, the, general, theory, of, employment, interest, and, money, last, year, at, the, sensational, price, of, 5, shillings, j, m, keynes, perhaps, meant, to, express, a, wish, for, the, broadest, and, earliest, possible, dissemination, of, his, new, ideas, keynes, s, work, on, the, general, theory, began, as, soon, as, his, treatise, on, money, had, been, published, in, 1930, he, was, already, dissatisfied, with, what, he, had, written, and, wanted, to, extend, the, scope, of, his, theory, to, output, and, employment, by, september, 1932, he, was, able, to, write, to, his, mother, i, have, written, nearly, a, third, of, my, new, book, on, monetary, theory, in, autumn, 1932, he, delivered, lectures, at, cambridge, under, the, title, the, monetary, theory, of, production, whose, content, was, close, to, the, treatise, except, in, giving, prominence, to, a, liquidity, preference, theory, of, interest, there, was, no, consumption, function, and, no, theory, of, effective, demand, wage, rates, were, discussed, in, a, criticism, of, pigou, in, autumn, 1933, keynes, s, lectures, were, much, closer, to, the, general, theory, including, the, consumption, function, effective, demand, and, a, statement, of, the, inability, of, workers, to, bargain, for, a, market, clearing, real, wage, in, a, monetary, economy, all, that, was, missing, was, a, theory, of, investment, by, spring, 1934, chapter, 12, was, in, its, final, form, his, lectures, in, autumn, of, that, year, bore, the, title, the, general, theory, of, employment, in, these, lectures, keynes, presented, the, marginal, efficiency, of, capital, in, much, the, same, form, as, it, took, in, chapter, 11, his, basic, chapter, as, kahn, called, it, he, gave, a, talk, on, the, same, subject, to, economists, at, oxford, in, february, 1935, this, was, the, final, building, block, of, the, general, theory, the, book, was, finished, in, december, 1935, and, published, in, february, 1936, many, economists, found, general, theory, difficult, to, read, with, tienne, mantoux, calling, it, obscure, frank, knight, calling, it, difficult, to, follow, michel, devroey, commenting, that, many, passages, of, his, book, were, almost, indecipherable, and, paul, samuelson, calling, the, analysis, unpalatable, and, incomprehensible, however, ra, l, rojas, dissents, saying, that, obscure, neo, classical, reinterpretations, are, completely, pointless, since, keynes, book, is, so, readable, keynes, did, not, set, out, a, detailed, policy, program, in, the, general, theory, but, he, went, on, in, practice, to, place, great, emphasis, on, the, reduction, of, long, term, interest, rates, and, the, reform, of, the, international, monetary, system, as, structural, measures, needed, to, encourage, both, investment, and, consumption, by, the, private, sector, paul, samuelson, said, that, the, general, theory, caught, most, economists, under, the, age, of, 35, with, the, unexpected, virulence, of, a, disease, first, attacking, and, decimating, an, isolated, tribe, of, south, sea, islanders, many, of, the, innovations, introduced, by, the, general, theory, continue, to, be, central, to, modern, macroeconomics, for, instance, the, idea, that, recessions, reflect, inadequate, aggregate, demand, and, that, say, s, law, in, keynes, s, formulation, that, supply, creates, its, own, demand, does, not, hold, in, a, monetary, economy, president, richard, nixon, famously, said, in, 1971, ironically, shortly, before, keynesian, economics, fell, out, of, fashion, that, we, are, all, keynesians, now, a, phrase, often, repeated, by, nobel, laureate, paul, krugman, but, originating, with, anti, keynesian, economist, milton, friedman, said, in, a, way, different, from, krugman, s, interpretation, nevertheless, starting, with, axel, leijonhufvud, this, view, of, keynesian, economics, came, under, increasing, challenge, and, scrutiny, and, has, now, divided, into, two, main, camps, prior, to, the, financial, crises, of, 2007, 9, the, majority, new, consensus, view, still, found, in, most, current, text, books, and, taught, in, all, universities, was, new, keynesian, economics, which, in, contrast, to, keynes, accepts, the, neoclassical, concept, of, long, run, equilibrium, but, allows, a, role, for, aggregate, demand, in, the, short, run, new, keynesian, economists, pride, themselves, on, providing, microeconomic, foundations, for, the, sticky, prices, and, wages, assumed, by, old, keynesian, economics, they, do, not, regard, the, general, theory, itself, as, helpful, to, further, research, the, minority, view, is, represented, by, post, keynesian, economists, all, of, whom, accept, keynes, s, fundamental, critique, of, the, neoclassical, concept, of, long, run, equilibrium, and, some, of, whom, think, the, general, theory, has, yet, to, be, properly, understood, and, repays, further, study, in, 2011, the, book, was, placed, on, time, s, top, 100, non, fiction, books, written, in, english, since, 1923, almost, 400, universities, are, teaching, a, revised, curriculum, that, takes, instability, seriously, and, keynes, s, notion, of, uncertainty, has, become, more, familiar, as, radical, uncertainty, from, the, outset, there, has, been, controversy, over, what, keynes, really, meant, many, early, reviews, were, highly, critical, the, success, of, what, came, to, be, known, as, neoclassical, synthesis, keynesian, economics, owed, a, great, deal, to, the, harvard, economist, alvin, hansen, and, mit, economist, paul, samuelson, as, well, as, to, the, oxford, economist, john, hicks, hansen, and, samuelson, offered, a, lucid, explanation, of, keynes, s, theory, of, aggregate, demand, with, their, elegant, 45, keynesian, cross, diagram, while, hicks, created, the, is, lm, diagram, both, of, these, diagrams, can, still, be, found, in, textbooks, post, keynesians, argue, that, the, neoclassical, keynesian, model, is, completely, distorting, and, misinterpreting, keynes, original, meaning, at, least, in, so, far, as, it, largely, rests, on, an, assumed, long, term, equilibrium, just, as, the, reception, of, the, general, theory, was, encouraged, by, the, 1930s, experience, of, mass, unemployment, its, fall, from, favour, was, associated, with, the, stagflation, of, the, 1970s, although, few, modern, economists, would, disagree, with, the, need, for, at, least, some, intervention, policies, such, as, labour, market, flexibility, are, underpinned, by, the, neoclassical, notion, of, equilibrium, in, the, long, run, although, keynes, explicitly, addresses, inflation, the, general, theory, does, not, treat, it, as, an, essentially, monetary, phenomenon, or, suggest, that, control, of, the, money, supply, or, interest, rates, is, the, key, remedy, for, inflation, unlike, neoclassical, theory, lastly, keynes, economic, theory, was, criticized, by, marxian, economists, who, said, that, keynes, ideas, while, good, intentioned, cannot, work, in, the, long, run, due, to, the, contradictions, in, capitalism, a, couple, of, these, contradictions, to, which, marxians, point, are, the, idea, of, full, employment, which, is, seen, as, impossible, under, private, capitalism, and, the, idea, that, government, can, encourage, capital, investment, through, government, spending, when, in, reality, government, spending, could, be, a, net, loss, on, profits, the, earliest, attempt, to, write, a, student, guide, was, robinson, 1937, and, the, most, successful, by, numbers, sold, was, hansen, 1953, these, are, both, quite, accessible, but, adhere, to, the, old, keynesian, school, of, the, time, an, up, to, date, post, keynesian, attempt, aimed, mainly, at, graduate, and, advanced, undergraduate, students, is, hayes, 2006, and, an, easier, version, is, sheehan, 2009, paul, krugman, has, written, an, introduction, to, the, 2007, palgrave, macmillan, edition, of, the, general, theory
