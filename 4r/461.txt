professional, theatre, originating, from, italian, theatre, that, was, popular, throughout, europe, between, the, 16th, and, 18th, centuries, it, was, formerly, called, italian, comedy, in, english, and, is, also, known, as, commedia, alla, maschera, commedia, improvviso, and, commedia, dell, arte, all, improvviso, characterized, by, masked, types, commedia, was, responsible, for, the, rise, of, actresses, such, as, isabella, andreini, and, improvised, performances, based, on, sketches, or, scenarios, a, commedia, such, as, the, tooth, puller, is, both, scripted, and, improvised, characters, entrances, and, exits, are, scripted, a, special, characteristic, of, commedia, is, the, lazzo, a, joke, or, something, foolish, or, witty, usually, well, known, to, the, performers, and, to, some, extent, a, scripted, routine, another, characteristic, of, commedia, is, pantomime, which, is, mostly, used, by, the, character, arlecchino, now, better, known, as, harlequin, the, characters, of, the, commedia, usually, represent, fixed, social, types, and, stock, characters, such, as, foolish, old, men, devious, servants, or, military, officers, full, of, false, bravado, the, characters, are, exaggerated, real, characters, such, as, a, know, it, all, doctor, called, il, dottore, a, greedy, old, man, called, pantalone, or, a, perfect, relationship, like, the, innamorati, many, troupes, were, formed, to, perform, commedia, including, i, gelosi, which, had, actors, such, as, isabella, andreini, and, her, husband, francesco, andreini, confidenti, troupe, desioi, troupe, and, fedeli, troupe, commedia, was, often, performed, outside, on, platforms, or, in, popular, areas, such, as, a, piazza, town, square, the, form, of, theatre, originated, in, italy, but, travelled, throughout, europe, sometimes, to, as, far, away, as, moscow, the, genesis, of, commedia, may, be, related, to, carnival, in, venice, where, the, author, and, actor, andrea, calmo, had, created, the, character, il, magnifico, the, precursor, to, the, vecchio, old, man, pantalone, by, 1570, in, the, flaminio, scala, scenario, for, example, il, magnifico, persists, and, is, interchangeable, with, pantalone, into, the, 17th, century, while, calmo, s, characters, which, also, included, the, spanish, capitano, and, a, il, dottore, type, were, not, masked, it, is, uncertain, at, what, point, the, characters, donned, the, mask, however, the, connection, to, carnival, the, period, between, epiphany, and, ash, wednesday, would, suggest, that, masking, was, a, convention, of, carnival, and, was, applied, at, some, point, the, tradition, in, northern, italy, is, centred, in, florence, mantua, and, venice, where, the, major, companies, came, under, the, protection, of, the, various, dukes, concomitantly, a, neapolitan, tradition, emerged, in, the, south, and, featured, the, prominent, stage, figure, pulcinella, which, has, been, long, associated, with, naples, and, derived, into, various, types, elsewhere, most, famously, as, the, puppet, character, punch, of, the, eponymous, punch, and, judy, shows, in, england, although, commedia, dell, arte, flourished, in, the, italian, theatre, during, the, mannerist, period, there, has, been, a, long, standing, tradition, of, trying, to, establish, historical, antecedents, in, antiquity, while, it, is, possible, to, detect, formal, similarities, between, the, commedia, dell, arte, and, earlier, theatrical, traditions, there, is, no, way, to, establish, certainty, of, origin, some, date, the, origins, to, the, period, of, the, roman, middle, republic, plautine, types, or, the, early, republic, atellan, farces, the, atellan, farces, of, the, early, roman, republic, featured, crude, types, wearing, masks, with, grossly, exaggerated, features, and, an, improvised, plot, some, historians, argue, that, atellan, stock, characters, pappus, maccus, buccus, and, manducus, are, the, primitive, versions, of, the, commedia, characters, pantalone, pulcinella, and, il, capitano, more, recent, accounts, establish, links, to, the, medieval, jongleurs, and, prototypes, from, medieval, moralities, such, as, hellequin, as, the, source, of, harlequin, for, example, the, first, recorded, commedia, dell, arte, performances, came, from, rome, as, early, as, 1551, commedia, dell, arte, was, performed, outdoors, in, temporary, venues, by, professional, actors, who, were, costumed, and, masked, as, opposed, to, commedia, erudita, which, were, written, comedies, presented, indoors, by, untrained, and, unmasked, actors, this, view, may, be, somewhat, romanticized, since, records, describe, the, gelosi, performing, tasso, s, aminta, for, example, and, much, was, done, at, court, rather, than, in, the, street, by, the, mid, 16th, century, specific, troupes, of, commedia, performers, began, to, coalesce, and, by, 1568, the, gelosi, became, a, distinct, company, in, keeping, with, the, tradition, of, the, italian, academies, the, gelosi, adopted, as, their, impress, or, coat, of, arms, the, two, faced, roman, god, janus, janus, symbolized, both, the, comings, and, goings, of, this, travelling, troupe, and, the, dual, nature, of, the, actor, who, impersonates, the, other, the, gelosi, performed, in, northern, italy, and, france, where, they, received, protection, and, patronage, from, the, king, of, france, despite, fluctuations, the, gelosi, maintained, stability, for, performances, with, the, usual, ten, two, vecchi, old, men, four, innamorati, two, male, and, two, female, lovers, two, zanni, a, captain, and, a, servetta, serving, maid, commedia, often, performed, inside, in, court, theatres, or, halls, and, also, as, some, fixed, theatres, such, as, teatro, baldrucca, in, florence, flaminio, scala, who, had, been, a, minor, performer, in, the, gelosi, published, the, scenarios, of, the, commedia, dell, arte, around, the, start, of, the, 17th, century, really, in, an, effort, to, legitimize, the, form, and, ensure, its, legacy, these, scenarios, are, highly, structured, and, built, around, the, symmetry, of, the, various, types, in, duet, two, zanni, vecchi, innamorate, and, innamorati, etc, in, commedia, dell, arte, female, roles, were, played, by, women, documented, as, early, as, the, 1560s, making, them, the, first, known, professional, actresses, in, europe, since, antiquity, lucrezia, di, siena, whose, name, is, on, a, contract, of, actors, from, 10, october, 1564, has, been, referred, to, as, the, first, italian, actress, known, by, name, with, vincenza, armani, and, barbara, flaminia, as, the, first, primadonnas, and, the, first, well, documented, actresses, in, italy, and, europe, in, the, 1570s, english, theatre, critics, generally, denigrated, the, troupes, with, their, female, actors, some, decades, later, ben, jonson, referred, to, one, female, performer, of, the, commedia, as, a, tumbling, whore, by, the, end, of, the, 1570s, italian, prelates, attempted, to, ban, female, performers, however, by, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, actresses, were, standard, on, the, italian, stage, the, italian, scholar, ferdinando, taviani, has, collated, a, number, of, church, documents, opposing, the, advent, of, the, actress, as, a, kind, of, courtesan, whose, scanty, attire, and, promiscuous, lifestyle, corrupted, young, men, or, at, least, infused, them, with, carnal, desires, taviani, s, term, negativa, poetica, describes, this, and, other, practices, offensive, to, the, church, while, giving, us, an, idea, of, the, phenomenon, of, the, commedia, dell, arte, performance, by, the, early, 17th, century, the, zanni, comedies, were, moving, from, pure, improvisational, street, performances, to, specified, and, clearly, delineated, acts, and, characters, three, books, written, during, the, 17th, century, cecchini, s, fruti, della, moderne, commedia, 1628, niccol, barbieri, s, la, supplica, 1634, and, perrucci, s, dell, arte, rapresentativa, 1699, made, firm, recommendations, concerning, performing, practice, katritzky, argues, that, as, a, result, commedia, was, reduced, to, formulaic, and, stylized, acting, as, far, as, possible, from, the, purity, of, the, improvisational, genesis, a, century, earlier, in, france, during, the, reign, of, louis, xiv, the, com, die, italienne, created, a, repertoire, and, delineated, new, masks, and, characters, while, deleting, some, of, the, italian, precursors, such, as, pantalone, french, playwrights, particularly, moli, re, gleaned, from, the, plots, and, masks, in, creating, an, indigenous, treatment, indeed, moli, re, shared, the, stage, with, the, com, die, italienne, at, petit, bourbon, and, some, of, his, forms, e, g, the, tirade, are, derivative, from, the, commedia, tirata, commedia, dell, arte, moved, outside, the, city, limits, to, the, th, tre, de, la, foire, or, fair, theatres, in, the, early, 17th, century, as, it, evolved, toward, a, more, pantomimed, style, with, the, dispatch, of, the, italian, comedians, from, france, in, 1697, the, form, transmogrified, in, the, 18th, century, as, genres, such, as, com, die, larmoyante, gained, in, attraction, in, france, particularly, through, the, plays, of, marivaux, marivaux, softened, the, commedia, considerably, by, bringing, in, true, emotion, to, the, stage, harlequin, achieved, more, prominence, during, this, period, it, is, possible, that, this, kind, of, improvised, acting, was, passed, down, the, italian, generations, until, the, 17th, century, when, it, was, revived, as, a, professional, theatrical, technique, however, as, currently, used, the, term, commedia, dell, arte, was, coined, in, the, mid, 18th, century, commedia, dell, arte, was, equally, if, not, more, popular, in, france, where, it, continued, its, popularity, throughout, the, 17th, century, until, 1697, and, it, was, in, france, that, commedia, developed, its, established, repertoire, commedia, evolved, into, various, configurations, across, europe, and, each, country, acculturated, the, form, to, its, liking, for, example, pantomime, which, flourished, in, the, 18th, century, owes, its, genesis, to, the, character, types, of, the, commedia, particularly, harlequin, the, punch, and, judy, puppet, shows, popular, to, this, day, in, england, owe, their, basis, to, the, pulcinella, mask, that, emerged, in, neapolitan, versions, of, the, form, in, italy, commedia, masks, and, plots, found, their, way, into, the, opera, buffa, and, the, plots, of, rossini, verdi, and, puccini, during, the, napoleonic, occupation, of, italy, instigators, of, reform, and, critics, of, french, imperial, rule, such, as, giacomo, casanova, used, the, carnival, masks, to, hide, their, identities, while, fueling, political, agendas, challenging, social, rule, and, hurling, blatant, insults, and, criticisms, at, the, regime, in, 1797, in, order, to, destroy, the, impromptu, style, of, carnival, as, a, partisan, platform, napoleon, outlawed, the, commedia, dell, arte, it, was, not, reborn, in, venice, until, 1979, because, of, this, compagnie, or, companies, were, troupes, of, actors, each, of, whom, had, a, specific, function, or, role, actors, were, versed, in, a, plethora, of, skills, with, many, having, joined, troupes, without, a, theatre, background, some, were, doctors, others, priests, others, soldiers, enticed, by, the, excitement, and, prevalence, of, theatre, in, italian, society, actors, were, known, to, switch, from, troupe, to, troupe, on, loan, and, companies, would, often, collaborate, if, unified, by, a, single, patron, or, performing, in, the, same, general, location, members, would, also, splinter, off, to, form, their, own, troupes, such, was, the, case, with, the, ganassa, and, the, gelosi, these, compagnie, travelled, throughout, europe, from, the, early, period, beginning, with, the, soldati, then, the, ganassa, who, travelled, to, spain, and, were, famous, for, playing, the, guitar, and, singing, never, to, be, heard, from, again, and, the, famous, troupes, of, the, golden, age, 1580, 1605, gelosi, confidenti, accessi, these, names, which, signified, daring, and, enterprise, were, appropriated, from, the, names, of, the, academies, in, a, sense, to, lend, legitimacy, however, each, troupe, had, its, impresse, like, a, coat, of, arms, which, symbolized, its, nature, the, gelosi, for, example, used, the, two, headed, face, of, the, roman, god, janus, to, signify, its, comings, and, goings, and, relationship, to, the, season, of, carnival, which, took, place, in, january, janus, also, signified, the, duality, of, the, actor, who, is, playing, a, character, or, mask, while, still, remaining, oneself, magistrates, and, clergy, were, not, always, receptive, to, the, travelling, compagnie, companies, particularly, during, periods, of, plague, and, because, of, their, itinerant, nature, actors, both, male, and, female, were, known, to, strip, nearly, naked, and, storylines, typically, descended, into, crude, situations, with, overt, sexuality, considered, to, teach, nothing, but, lewdness, and, adultery, of, both, sexes, by, the, french, parliament, the, term, vagabondi, was, used, in, reference, to, the, comici, and, remains, a, derogatory, term, to, this, day, vagabond, this, was, in, reference, to, the, nomadic, nature, of, the, troupes, often, instigated, by, persecution, from, the, church, civil, authorities, and, rival, theatre, organisations, that, forced, the, companies, to, move, from, place, to, place, a, troupe, often, consisted, of, ten, performers, of, familiar, masked, and, unmasked, types, and, included, women, the, companies, would, employ, carpenters, props, masters, servants, nurses, and, prompters, all, of, whom, would, travel, with, the, company, they, would, travel, in, large, carts, laden, with, supplies, necessary, for, their, nomadic, style, of, performance, enabling, them, to, move, from, place, to, place, without, having, to, worry, about, the, difficulties, of, relocation, this, nomadic, nature, though, influenced, by, persecution, was, also, largely, due, in, part, to, the, troupes, requiring, new, and, paying, audiences, they, would, take, advantage, of, public, fairs, and, celebrations, most, often, in, wealthier, towns, where, financial, success, was, more, probable, companies, would, also, find, themselves, summoned, by, high, ranking, officials, who, would, offer, patronage, in, return, for, performing, in, their, land, for, a, certain, amount, of, time, companies, in, fact, preferred, to, not, stay, in, any, one, place, too, long, mostly, out, of, a, fear, of, the, act, becoming, stale, they, would, move, on, to, the, next, location, while, their, popularity, was, still, active, ensuring, the, towns, and, people, were, sad, to, see, them, leave, and, would, be, more, likely, to, either, invite, them, back, or, pay, to, watch, performances, again, should, the, troupe, ever, return, prices, were, dependent, on, the, troupe, s, decision, which, could, vary, depending, on, the, wealth, of, the, location, the, length, of, stay, and, the, regulations, governments, had, in, place, for, dramatic, performances, generally, the, actors, playing, were, diverse, in, background, in, terms, of, class, and, religion, and, performed, anywhere, they, could, castagno, posits, that, the, aesthetic, of, exaggeration, distortion, anti, humanism, as, in, the, masked, types, and, excessive, borrowing, as, opposed, to, originality, was, typical, of, all, the, arts, in, the, late, italian, renaissance, theatre, historian, martin, green, points, to, the, extravagance, of, emotion, during, the, period, of, commedia, s, emergence, as, the, reason, for, representational, moods, or, characters, that, define, the, art, in, commedia, each, character, embodies, a, mood, mockery, sadness, gaiety, confusion, and, so, forth, according, to, 18th, century, london, theatre, critic, baretti, commedia, dell, arte, incorporates, specific, roles, and, characters, that, were, originally, intended, as, a, kind, of, characteristic, representative, of, some, particular, italian, district, or, town, archetypes, the, character, s, persona, included, the, specific, dialect, of, the, region, or, town, represented, meaning, that, on, stage, each, character, was, performed, in, its, own, dialect, characters, would, often, be, passed, down, from, generation, to, generation, and, characters, married, onstage, were, often, married, in, real, life, as, well, seen, most, famously, with, francesco, and, isabella, andreini, this, was, believed, to, make, performances, more, natural, as, well, as, strengthening, the, bonds, within, the, troupe, who, emphasized, complete, unity, between, every, member, additionally, each, character, has, a, singular, costume, and, mask, that, is, representative, of, the, character, s, role, commedia, dell, arte, has, four, stock, character, groups, masked, characters, are, often, referred, to, as, masks, in, italian, maschere, which, according, to, john, rudlin, cannot, be, separated, from, the, character, in, other, words, the, characteristics, of, the, character, and, the, characteristics, of, the, mask, are, the, same, in, time, however, the, word, maschere, came, to, refer, to, all, of, the, characters, of, the, commedia, dell, arte, whether, masked, or, not, female, characters, including, female, servants, are, most, often, not, masked, female, amorose, are, never, masked, the, female, character, in, the, masters, group, is, called, prima, donna, and, can, be, one, of, the, lovers, there, is, also, a, female, character, known, as, the, courtisane, who, can, also, have, a, servant, female, servants, wore, bonnets, their, character, was, played, with, a, malicious, wit, or, gossipy, gaiety, the, amorosi, are, often, children, of, a, male, character, in, the, masters, group, but, not, of, any, female, character, in, the, masters, group, which, may, represent, younger, women, who, have, e, g, married, an, old, man, or, a, high, class, courtesan, female, characters, in, the, masters, group, while, younger, than, their, male, counterparts, are, nevertheless, older, than, the, amorosi, some, of, the, better, known, commedia, dell, arte, characters, are, pierrot, and, pierrette, pantalone, gianduja, il, dottore, brighella, il, capitano, colombina, the, innamorati, pedrolino, pulcinella, arlecchino, sandrone, scaramuccia, also, known, as, scaramouche, la, signora, and, tartaglia, in, the, 17th, century, as, commedia, became, popular, in, france, the, characters, of, pierrot, columbina, and, harlequin, were, refined, and, became, essentially, parisian, according, to, green, each, character, in, commedia, dell, arte, has, a, distinct, costume, that, helps, the, audience, understand, who, the, character, is, arlecchino, originally, wore, a, tight, fitting, long, jacket, with, matching, trousers, that, both, had, numerous, odd, shaped, patches, usually, green, yellow, red, and, brown, usually, there, was, a, bat, and, a, wallet, that, would, hang, from, his, belt, his, hat, which, was, a, soft, cap, was, modeled, after, charles, ix, or, after, henri, ii, and, almost, always, had, a, tail, of, a, rabbit, hare, or, a, fox, with, the, occasional, tuft, of, feathers, during, the, 17th, century, the, patches, turned, into, blue, red, and, green, triangles, arranged, in, a, symmetrical, pattern, the, 18th, century, is, when, the, iconic, arlecchino, look, with, the, diamond, shaped, lozenges, took, shape, the, jacket, became, shorter, and, his, hat, changed, from, a, soft, cap, to, a, double, pointed, hat, il, dottore, s, costume, was, a, play, on, the, academic, dress, of, the, bolognese, scholars, il, dottore, is, almost, always, clothed, entirely, in, black, he, wore, a, long, black, gown, or, jacket, that, went, below, the, knees, over, the, gown, he, would, have, a, long, black, robe, that, went, down, to, his, heels, and, he, would, have, on, black, shoes, stockings, and, breeches, in, 1653, his, costume, was, changed, by, augustin, lolli, who, was, a, very, popular, il, dottore, actor, he, added, an, enormous, black, hat, changed, the, robe, to, a, jacket, cut, similarly, to, louis, xiv, and, added, a, flat, ruff, to, the, neck, il, capitano, s, costume, is, similar, to, il, dottore, s, in, the, fact, that, it, is, also, a, satire, on, military, wear, of, the, time, this, costume, would, therefore, change, depending, on, where, the, capitano, character, is, from, and, the, period, the, capitano, is, from, pantalone, has, one, of, the, most, iconic, costumes, of, commedia, dell, arte, typically, he, would, wear, a, tight, fitting, jacket, with, a, matching, pair, of, trousers, he, usually, pairs, these, two, with, a, big, black, coat, called, a, zimarra, women, who, usually, played, servants, or, lovers, wore, less, stylized, costumes, than, the, men, in, commedia, the, lovers, innamorati, would, wear, what, was, considered, to, be, the, fashion, of, the, time, period, they, would, normally, not, wear, masks, but, would, be, heavily, makeuped, conventional, plot, lines, were, written, on, themes, of, sex, jealousy, love, and, old, age, many, of, the, basic, plot, elements, can, be, traced, back, to, the, roman, comedies, of, plautus, and, terence, some, of, which, were, themselves, translations, of, lost, greek, comedies, of, the, 4th, century, bc, however, it, is, more, probable, that, the, comici, used, contemporary, novella, or, traditional, sources, and, drew, from, current, events, and, local, news, of, the, day, not, all, scenarios, were, comic, there, were, some, mixed, forms, and, even, tragedies, shakespeare, s, the, tempest, is, drawn, from, a, popular, scenario, in, the, scala, collection, his, polonius, hamlet, is, drawn, from, pantalone, and, his, clowns, bear, homage, to, the, zanni, comici, performed, written, comedies, at, court, song, and, dance, were, widely, used, and, a, number, of, innamorati, were, skilled, madrigalists, a, song, form, that, uses, chromatics, and, close, harmonies, audiences, came, to, see, the, performers, with, plotlines, becoming, secondary, to, the, performance, among, the, great, innamorate, isabella, andreini, was, perhaps, the, most, widely, known, and, a, medallion, dedicated, to, her, reads, eternal, fame, tristano, martinelli, achieved, international, fame, as, the, first, of, the, great, arlecchinos, and, was, honoured, by, the, medici, and, the, queen, of, france, performers, made, use, of, well, rehearsed, jokes, and, stock, physical, gags, known, as, lazzi, and, concetti, as, well, as, on, the, spot, improvised, and, interpolated, episodes, and, routines, called, burle, sg, burla, italian, for, joke, usually, involving, a, practical, joke, since, the, productions, were, improvised, dialogue, and, action, could, easily, be, changed, to, satirize, local, scandals, current, events, or, regional, tastes, while, still, using, old, jokes, and, punchlines, characters, were, identified, by, costumes, masks, and, props, such, as, a, type, of, baton, known, as, a, slapstick, these, characters, included, the, forebears, of, the, modern, clown, namely, harlequin, arlecchino, and, the, zanni, harlequin, in, particular, was, allowed, to, comment, on, current, events, in, his, entertainment, the, classic, traditional, plot, is, that, the, innamorati, are, in, love, and, wish, to, be, married, but, one, elder, vecchio, or, several, elders, vecchi, are, preventing, this, from, happening, leading, the, lovers, to, ask, one, or, more, zanni, eccentric, servants, for, help, typically, the, story, ends, happily, with, the, marriage, of, the, innamorati, and, forgiveness, for, any, wrongdoings, while, generally, personally, unscripted, the, performances, often, were, based, on, scenarios, that, gave, some, semblance, of, a, plot, to, the, largely, improvised, format, the, flaminio, scala, scenarios, published, in, the, early, 17th, century, are, the, most, widely, known, collection, and, representative, of, its, most, esteemed, compagnia, i, gelosi, the, iconography, of, the, commedia, dell, arte, represents, an, entire, field, of, study, that, has, been, examined, by, commedia, scholars, such, as, erenstein, castagno, katritzky, molinari, and, others, in, the, early, period, representative, works, by, painters, at, fontainebleau, were, notable, for, their, erotic, depictions, of, the, thinly, veiled, innamorata, or, the, bare, breasted, courtesan, actress, the, flemish, influence, is, widely, documented, as, commedia, figures, entered, the, world, of, the, vanitas, genre, depicting, the, dangers, of, lust, drinking, and, the, hedonistic, lifestyle, castagno, describes, the, flemish, pittore, vago, wandering, painters, who, assimilated, themselves, within, italian, workshops, and, even, assumed, italian, surnames, one, of, the, most, influential, painters, lodewyk, toeput, for, example, became, ludovico, pozzoserrato, and, was, a, celebrated, painter, in, the, veneto, region, of, italy, the, pittore, vago, can, be, attributed, with, establishing, commedia, dell, arte, as, a, genre, of, painting, that, would, persist, for, centuries, while, the, iconography, gives, evidence, of, the, performance, style, see, fossard, collection, it, is, important, to, note, that, many, of,
