widely, considered, the, pre, eminent, work, in, italian, literature, and, one, of, the, greatest, works, of, western, literature, the, poem, s, imaginative, vision, of, the, afterlife, is, representative, of, the, medieval, worldview, as, it, existed, in, the, western, church, by, the, 14th, century, it, helped, establish, the, tuscan, language, in, which, it, is, written, as, the, standardized, italian, language, it, is, divided, into, three, parts, inferno, purgatorio, and, paradiso, the, poem, discusses, the, state, of, the, soul, after, death, and, presents, an, image, of, divine, justice, meted, out, as, due, punishment, or, reward, and, describes, dante, s, travels, through, hell, purgatory, and, heaven, allegorically, the, poem, represents, the, soul, s, journey, towards, god, beginning, with, the, recognition, and, rejection, of, sin, inferno, followed, by, the, penitent, christian, life, purgatorio, which, is, then, followed, by, the, soul, s, ascent, to, god, paradiso, dante, draws, on, medieval, catholic, theology, and, philosophy, especially, thomistic, philosophy, derived, from, the, summa, theologica, of, thomas, aquinas, in, the, poem, the, pilgrim, dante, is, accompanied, by, three, guides, virgil, who, represents, human, reason, and, who, guides, him, for, all, of, inferno, and, most, of, purgatorio, beatrice, who, represents, divine, revelation, in, addition, to, theology, grace, and, faith, and, guides, him, from, the, end, of, purgatorio, onwards, and, saint, bernard, of, clairvaux, who, represents, contemplative, mysticism, and, devotion, to, mary, the, mother, guiding, him, in, the, final, cantos, of, paradiso, the, work, was, originally, simply, titled, comed, a, pronounced, tuscan, for, comedy, so, also, in, the, first, printed, edition, published, in, 1472, later, adjusted, to, the, modern, italian, commedia, the, adjective, divina, was, added, by, giovanni, boccaccio, owing, to, its, subject, matter, and, lofty, style, and, the, first, edition, to, name, the, poem, divina, comedia, in, the, title, was, that, of, the, venetian, humanist, lodovico, dolce, published, in, 1555, by, gabriele, giolito, de, ferrari, the, divine, comedy, is, composed, of, 14, 233, lines, that, are, divided, into, three, cantiche, singular, cantica, inferno, hell, purgatorio, purgatory, and, paradiso, paradise, each, consisting, of, 33, cantos, italian, plural, canti, an, initial, canto, serving, as, an, introduction, to, the, poem, and, generally, considered, to, be, part, of, the, first, cantica, brings, the, total, number, of, cantos, to, 100, it, is, generally, accepted, however, that, the, first, two, cantos, serve, as, a, unitary, prologue, to, the, entire, epic, and, that, the, opening, two, cantos, of, each, cantica, serve, as, prologues, to, each, of, the, three, cantiche, the, number, three, is, prominent, in, the, work, represented, in, part, by, the, number, of, cantiche, and, their, lengths, additionally, the, verse, scheme, used, terza, rima, is, hendecasyllabic, lines, of, eleven, syllables, with, the, lines, composing, tercets, according, to, the, rhyme, scheme, aba, bcb, cdc, ded, the, total, number, of, syllables, in, each, tercet, is, thus, 33, the, same, as, the, number, of, cantos, in, each, cantica, written, in, the, first, person, the, poem, tells, of, dante, s, journey, through, the, three, realms, of, the, dead, lasting, from, the, night, before, good, friday, to, the, wednesday, after, easter, in, the, spring, of, 1300, the, roman, poet, virgil, guides, him, through, hell, and, purgatory, beatrice, dante, s, ideal, woman, guides, him, through, heaven, beatrice, was, a, florentine, woman, he, had, met, in, childhood, and, admired, from, afar, in, the, mode, of, the, then, fashionable, courtly, love, tradition, which, is, highlighted, in, dante, s, earlier, work, la, vita, nuova, the, cistercian, abbot, bernard, of, clairvaux, guides, dante, through, the, last, three, cantos, the, structure, of, the, three, realms, follows, a, common, numerical, pattern, of, 9, plus, 1, for, a, total, of, 10, there, are, nine, circles, of, the, inferno, followed, by, lucifer, contained, at, its, bottom, nine, rings, of, mount, purgatory, followed, by, the, garden, of, eden, crowning, its, summit, and, the, nine, celestial, bodies, of, paradiso, followed, by, the, empyrean, containing, the, very, essence, of, god, within, each, group, of, nine, seven, elements, correspond, to, a, specific, moral, scheme, subdivided, into, three, subcategories, while, two, others, of, greater, particularity, are, added, to, total, nine, for, example, the, seven, deadly, sins, that, are, cleansed, in, purgatory, are, joined, by, special, realms, for, the, late, repentant, and, the, excommunicated, the, core, seven, sins, within, purgatory, correspond, to, a, moral, scheme, of, love, perverted, subdivided, into, three, groups, corresponding, to, excessive, love, lust, gluttony, greed, deficient, love, sloth, and, malicious, love, wrath, envy, pride, in, central, italy, s, political, struggle, between, guelphs, and, ghibellines, dante, was, part, of, the, guelphs, who, in, general, favored, the, papacy, over, the, holy, roman, emperor, florence, s, guelphs, split, into, factions, around, 1300, the, white, guelphs, and, the, black, guelphs, dante, was, among, the, white, guelphs, who, were, exiled, in, 1302, by, the, lord, mayor, cante, de, gabrielli, di, gubbio, after, troops, under, charles, of, valois, entered, the, city, at, the, request, of, pope, boniface, viii, who, supported, the, black, guelphs, this, exile, which, lasted, the, rest, of, dante, s, life, shows, its, influence, in, many, parts, of, the, comedy, from, prophecies, of, dante, s, exile, to, dante, s, views, of, politics, to, the, eternal, damnation, of, some, of, his, opponents, the, last, word, in, each, of, the, three, cantiche, is, stelle, stars, the, poem, begins, on, the, night, before, good, friday, in, the, year, 1300, halfway, along, our, life, s, path, nel, mezzo, del, cammin, di, nostra, vita, dante, is, thirty, five, years, old, half, of, the, biblical, lifespan, of, seventy, psalms, 89, 10, vulgate, lost, in, a, dark, wood, understood, as, sin, assailed, by, beasts, a, lion, a, leopard, and, a, she, wolf, he, cannot, evade, and, unable, to, find, the, straight, way, diritta, via, to, salvation, symbolized, by, the, sun, behind, the, mountain, conscious, that, he, is, ruining, himself, and, that, he, is, falling, into, a, low, place, basso, loco, where, the, sun, is, silent, l, sol, tace, dante, is, at, last, rescued, by, virgil, and, the, two, of, them, begin, their, journey, to, the, underworld, each, sin, s, punishment, in, inferno, is, a, contrapasso, a, symbolic, instance, of, poetic, justice, for, example, in, canto, xx, fortune, tellers, and, soothsayers, must, walk, with, their, heads, on, backwards, unable, to, see, what, is, ahead, because, that, was, what, they, had, tried, to, do, in, life, they, had, their, faces, twisted, toward, their, haunches, and, found, it, necessary, to, walk, backward, because, they, could, not, see, ahead, of, them, and, since, he, wanted, so, to, see, ahead, he, looks, behind, and, walks, a, backward, path, allegorically, the, inferno, represents, the, christian, soul, seeing, sin, for, what, it, really, is, and, the, three, beasts, represent, three, types, of, sin, the, self, indulgent, the, violent, and, the, malicious, these, three, types, of, sin, also, provide, the, three, main, divisions, of, dante, s, hell, upper, hell, outside, the, city, of, dis, for, the, four, sins, of, indulgence, lust, gluttony, avarice, anger, circle, 7, for, the, sins, of, violence, against, one, s, neighbor, against, oneself, and, against, god, art, and, nature, and, circles, 8, and, 9, for, the, sins, of, fraud, and, treachery, added, to, these, are, two, dissimilar, spiritual, categories, limbo, in, circle, 1, contains, the, virtuous, pagans, who, were, not, sinful, but, were, ignorant, of, christ, and, circle, 6, contains, the, heretics, who, contradicted, the, doctrine, and, confused, the, spirit, of, christ, having, survived, the, depths, of, hell, dante, and, virgil, ascend, out, of, the, undergloom, to, the, mountain, of, purgatory, on, the, far, side, of, the, world, the, mountain, is, on, an, island, the, only, land, in, the, southern, hemisphere, created, by, the, displacement, of, rock, which, resulted, when, satan, s, fall, created, hell, which, dante, portrays, as, existing, underneath, jerusalem, the, mountain, has, seven, terraces, corresponding, to, the, seven, deadly, sins, or, seven, roots, of, sinfulness, the, classification, of, sin, here, is, more, psychological, than, that, of, the, inferno, being, based, on, motives, rather, than, actions, it, is, also, drawn, primarily, from, christian, theology, rather, than, from, classical, sources, however, dante, s, illustrative, examples, of, sin, and, virtue, draw, on, classical, sources, as, well, as, on, the, bible, and, on, contemporary, events, love, a, theme, throughout, the, divine, comedy, is, particularly, important, for, the, framing, of, sin, on, the, mountain, of, purgatory, while, the, love, that, flows, from, god, is, pure, it, can, become, sinful, as, it, flows, through, humanity, humans, can, sin, by, using, love, towards, improper, or, malicious, ends, wrath, envy, pride, or, using, it, to, proper, ends, but, with, love, that, is, either, not, strong, enough, sloth, or, love, that, is, too, strong, lust, gluttony, greed, below, the, seven, purges, of, the, soul, is, the, ante, purgatory, containing, the, excommunicated, from, the, church, and, the, late, repentant, who, died, often, violently, before, receiving, rites, thus, the, total, comes, to, nine, with, the, addition, of, the, garden, of, eden, at, the, summit, equaling, ten, allegorically, the, purgatorio, represents, the, christian, life, christian, souls, arrive, escorted, by, an, angel, singing, in, exitu, israel, de, aegypto, in, his, letter, to, cangrande, the, authenticity, of, which, is, disputed, dante, explains, that, this, reference, to, israel, leaving, egypt, refers, both, to, the, redemption, of, christ, and, to, the, conversion, of, the, soul, from, the, sorrow, and, misery, of, sin, to, the, state, of, grace, appropriately, therefore, it, is, easter, sunday, when, dante, and, virgil, arrive, the, purgatorio, demonstrates, the, medieval, knowledge, of, a, spherical, earth, during, the, poem, dante, discusses, the, different, stars, visible, in, the, southern, hemisphere, the, altered, position, of, the, sun, and, the, various, time, zones, of, the, earth, at, this, stage, it, is, dante, says, sunset, at, jerusalem, midnight, on, the, river, ganges, and, sunrise, in, purgatory, after, an, initial, ascension, beatrice, guides, dante, through, the, nine, celestial, spheres, of, heaven, these, are, concentric, and, spherical, as, in, aristotelian, and, ptolemaic, cosmology, while, the, structures, of, the, inferno, and, purgatorio, were, based, on, different, classifications, of, sin, the, structure, of, the, paradiso, is, based, on, the, four, cardinal, virtues, and, the, three, theological, virtues, the, seven, lowest, spheres, of, heaven, deal, solely, with, the, cardinal, virtues, of, prudence, fortitude, justice, and, temperance, the, first, three, spheres, involve, a, deficiency, of, one, of, the, cardinal, virtues, the, moon, containing, the, inconstant, whose, vows, to, god, waned, as, the, moon, and, thus, lack, fortitude, mercury, containing, the, ambitious, who, were, virtuous, for, glory, and, thus, lacked, justice, and, venus, containing, the, lovers, whose, love, was, directed, towards, another, than, god, and, thus, lacked, temperance, the, final, four, incidentally, are, positive, examples, of, the, cardinal, virtues, all, led, on, by, the, sun, containing, the, prudent, whose, wisdom, lighted, the, way, for, the, other, virtues, to, which, the, others, are, bound, constituting, a, category, on, its, own, mars, contains, the, men, of, fortitude, who, died, in, the, cause, of, christianity, jupiter, contains, the, kings, of, justice, and, saturn, contains, the, temperate, the, monks, the, seven, subdivided, into, three, are, raised, further, by, two, more, categories, the, eighth, sphere, of, the, fixed, stars, that, contain, those, who, achieved, the, theological, virtues, of, faith, hope, and, love, and, represent, the, church, triumphant, the, total, perfection, of, humanity, cleansed, of, all, the, sins, and, carrying, all, the, virtues, of, heaven, and, the, ninth, circle, or, primum, mobile, corresponding, to, the, geocentricism, of, medieval, astronomy, which, contains, the, angels, creatures, never, poisoned, by, original, sin, topping, them, all, is, the, empyrean, which, contains, the, essence, of, god, completing, the, nine, fold, division, to, ten, dante, meets, and, converses, with, several, great, saints, of, the, church, including, thomas, aquinas, bonaventure, saint, peter, and, st, john, near, the, end, beatrice, departs, and, bernard, of, clairvaux, takes, over, as, the, guide, the, paradiso, is, more, theological, in, nature, than, the, inferno, and, the, purgatorio, however, dante, admits, that, the, vision, of, heaven, he, receives, is, merely, the, one, his, human, eyes, permit, him, to, see, and, thus, dante, s, personal, vision, the, divine, comedy, finishes, with, dante, seeing, the, triune, god, in, a, flash, of, understanding, that, he, cannot, express, dante, finally, understands, the, mystery, of, christ, s, divinity, and, humanity, and, his, soul, becomes, aligned, with, god, s, love, but, already, my, desire, and, my, will, were, being, turned, like, a, wheel, all, at, one, speed, by, the, love, which, moves, the, sun, and, the, other, stars, according, to, the, italian, dante, society, no, original, manuscript, written, by, dante, has, survived, although, there, are, many, manuscript, copies, from, the, 14th, and, 15th, centuries, some, 800, are, listed, on, their, site, coluccio, salutati, translated, some, quotations, from, the, comedy, into, latin, for, his, de, fato, et, fortuna, in, 1396, 1397, the, first, complete, translation, of, the, comedy, was, made, into, latin, prose, by, giovanni, da, serravalle, in, 1416, for, two, english, bishops, robert, hallam, and, nicholas, bubwith, and, an, italian, cardinal, amedeo, di, saluzzo, it, was, made, during, the, council, of, constance, the, first, verse, translation, into, latin, hexameters, was, made, in, 1427, 1431, by, matteo, ronto, the, first, translation, of, the, comedy, into, another, vernacular, was, the, prose, translation, into, castilian, completed, by, enrique, de, villena, in, 1428, the, first, vernacular, verse, translation, was, that, of, andreu, febrer, into, catalan, in, 1429, the, first, printed, edition, was, published, in, foligno, italy, by, johann, numeister, and, evangelista, angelini, da, trevi, on, 11, april, 1472, of, the, 300, copies, printed, fourteen, still, survive, the, original, printing, press, is, on, display, in, the, oratorio, della, nunziatella, in, foligno, the, divine, comedy, can, be, described, simply, as, an, allegory, each, canto, and, the, episodes, therein, can, contain, many, alternative, meanings, dante, s, allegory, however, is, more, complex, and, in, explaining, how, to, read, the, poem, see, the, letter, to, cangrande, he, outlines, other, levels, of, meaning, besides, the, allegory, the, historical, the, moral, the, literal, and, the, anagogical, the, structure, of, the, poem, is, also, quite, complex, with, mathematical, and, numerological, patterns, distributed, throughout, the, work, particularly, threes, and, nines, the, poem, is, often, lauded, for, its, particularly, human, qualities, dante, s, skillful, delineation, of, the, characters, he, encounters, in, hell, purgatory, and, paradise, his, bitter, denunciations, of, florentine, and, italian, politics, and, his, powerful, poetic, imagination, dante, s, use, of, real, characters, according, to, dorothy, sayers, in, her, introduction, to, her, translation, of, the, inferno, allows, dante, the, freedom, of, not, having, to, involve, the, reader, in, description, and, allows, him, to, room, in, his, poem, for, the, discussion, of, a, great, many, subjects, of, the, utmost, importance, thus, widening, its, range, and, increasing, its, variety, dante, called, the, poem, comedy, the, adjective, divine, was, added, later, in, the, 16th, century, because, poems, in, the, ancient, world, were, classified, as, high, tragedy, or, low, comedy, low, poems, had, happy, endings, and, were, written, in, everyday, language, whereas, high, poems, treated, more, serious, matters, and, were, written, in, an, elevated, style, dante, was, one, of, the, first, in, the, middle, ages, to, write, of, a, serious, subject, the, redemption, of, humanity, in, the, low, and, vulgar, italian, language, and, not, the, latin, one, might, expect, for, such, a, serious, topic, boccaccio, s, account, that, an, early, version, of, the, poem, was, begun, by, dante, in, latin, is, still, controversial, although, the, divine, comedy, is, primarily, a, religious, poem, discussing, sin, virtue, and, theology, dante, also, discusses, several, elements, of, the, science, of, his, day, this, mixture, of, science, with, poetry, has, received, both, praise, and, criticism, over, the, centuries, the, purgatorio, repeatedly, refers, to, the, implications, of, a, spherical, earth, such, as, the, different, stars, visible, in, the, southern, hemisphere, the, altered, position, of, the, sun, and, the, various, time, zones, of, the, earth, for, example, at, sunset, in, purgatory, it, is, midnight, at, the, ebro, dawn, in, jerusalem, and, noon, on, the, river, ganges, just, as, there, where, its, maker, shed, his, blood, the, sun, shed, its, first, rays, and, ebro, lay, beneath, high, libra, and, the, ninth, hour, s, rays, were, scorching, ganges, waves, so, here, the, sun, stood, at, the, point, of, day, s, departure, when, god, s, angel, happy, showed, himself, to, us, dante, travels, through, the, centre, of, the, earth, in, the, inferno, and, comments, on, the, resulting, change, in, the, direction, of, gravity, in, canto, xxxiv, lines, 76, 120, a, little, earlier, xxxiii, 102, 105, he, queries, the, existence, of, wind, in, the, frozen, inner, circle, of, hell, since, it, has, no, temperature, differentials, inevitably, given, its, setting, the, paradiso, discusses, astronomy, extensively, but, in, the, ptolemaic, sense, the, paradiso, also, discusses, the, importance, of, the, experimental, method, in, science, with, a, detailed, example, in, lines, 94, 105, of, canto, ii, a, briefer, example, occurs, in, canto, xv, of, the, purgatorio, lines, 16, 21, where, dante, points, out, that, both, theory, and, experiment, confirm, that, the, angle, of, incidence, is, equal, to, the, angle, of, reflection, other, references, to, science, in, the, paradiso, include, descriptions, of, clockwork, in, canto, xxiv, lines, 13, 18, and, thales, theorem, about, triangles, in, canto, xiii, lines, 101, 102, galileo, galilei, is, known, to, have, lectured, on, the, inferno, and, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, poem, may, have, influenced, some, of, galileo, s, own, ideas, regarding, mechanics, without, access, to, the, works, of, homer, dante, used, virgil, lucan, ovid, and, statius, as, the, models, for, the, style, history, and, mythology, of, the, comedy, this, is, most, obvious, in, the, case, of, virgil, who, appears, as, a, mentor, character, throughout, the, first, two, canticles, and, who, has, his, epic, the, aeneid, praised, with, language, dante, reserves, elsewhere, for, scripture, ovid, is, given, less, explicit, praise, in, the, poem, but, besides, virgil, dante, uses, ovid, as, a, source, more, than, any, other, poet, mostly, through, metaphors, and, fantastical, episodes, based, on, those, in, the, metamorphoses, less, influential, than, either, of, the, two, are, statius, and, lucan, the, latter, of, whom, has, only, been, given, proper, recognition, as, a, source, in, the, divine, comedy, in, the, twentieth, century, besides, dante, s, fellow, poets, the, classical, figure, that, most, influenced, the, comedy, is, aristotle, dante, built, up, the, philosophy, of, the, comedy, with, the, works, of, aristotle, as, a, foundation, just, as, the, scholastics, used, aristotle, as, the, basis, for, their, thinking, dante, knew, aristotle, directly, from, latin, translations, of, his, works, and, indirectly, quotations, in, the, works, of, albertus, magnus, dante, even, acknowledges, aristotle, s, influence, explicitly, in, the, poem, specifically, when, virgil, justifies, the, inferno, s, structure, by, citing, the, nicomachean, ethics, in, the, same, canto, virgil, draws, on, cicero, s, de, officiis, to, explain, why, sins, of, the, intellect, are, worse, than, sins, of, violence, a, key, point, that, would, be, explored, from, canto, xviii, to, the, end, of, the, inferno, the, divine, comedy, s, language, is, often, derived, from, the, phraseology, of, the, vulgate, this, was, the, only, translation, of, the, bible, dante, had, access, to, as, it, was, one, the, vast, majority, of, scribes, were, willing, to, copy, during, the, middle, ages, this, includes, five, hundred, or, so, direct, quotes, and, references, dante, derives, from, the, bible, or, his, memory, of, it, dante, also, treats, the, bible, as, a, final, authority, on, any, matter, including, on, subjects, scripture, only, approaches, allegorically, the, divine, comedy, is, also, a, product, of, scholasticism, especially, as, expressed, by, st, thomas, aquinas, this, influence, is, most, pronounced, in, the, paradiso, where, the, text, s, portrayals, of, god, the, beatific, vision, and, substantial, forms, all, align, with, scholastic, doctrine, it, is, also, in, the, paradiso, that, aquinas, and, fellow, scholastic, st, bonaventure, appear, as, characters, introducing, dante, to, all, of, heaven, s, wisest, souls, despite, all, this, there, are, issues, on, which, dante, diverges, from, the, scholastic, doctrine, such, as, in, his, unbridled, praise, for, poetry, consequently, the, divine, comedy, has, been, called, the, summa, in, verse, the, apocalypse, of, peter, is, one, of, the, earliest, examples, of, a, christian, jewish, katabasis, a, genre, of, explicit, depictions, of, heaven, and, hell, later, works, inspired, by, it, include, the, apocalypse, of, thomas, in, the, 2nd, 4th, century, and, more, importantly, the, apocalypse, of, paul, in, the, 4th, century, despite, a, lack, of, official, approval, the, apocalypse, of, paul, would, go, on, to, be, popular, for, centuries, possibly, due, to, its, popularity, among, the, medieval, monks, that, copied, and, preserved, manuscripts, in, the, turbulent, centuries, following, the, fall, of, the, western, roman, empire, the, divine, comedy, belongs, to, the, same, genre, and, was, influenced, by, the, apocalypse, of, paul, dante, lived, in, a, europe, of, substantial, literary, and, philosophical, contact, with, the, muslim, world, encouraged, by, such, factors, as, averroism, averrois, che, l, gran, comento, feo, commedia, inferno, iv, 144, meaning, averrois, who, wrote, the, great, comment, and, the, patronage, of, alfonso, x, of, castile, of, the, twelve, wise, men, dante, meets, in, canto, x, of, the, paradiso, thomas, aquinas, and, even, more, so, siger, of, brabant, were, strongly, influenced, by, arabic, commentators, on, aristotle, medieval, christian, mysticism, also, shared, the, neoplatonic, influence, of, sufis, such, as, ibn, arabi, philosopher, frederick, copleston, argued, in, 1950, that, dante, s, respectful, treatment, of, averroes, avicenna, and, siger, of, brabant, indicates, his, acknowledgement, of, a, considerable, debt, to, islamic, philosophy, in, 1919, miguel, as, n, palacios, a, spanish, scholar, and, a, catholic, priest, published, la, escatolog, a, musulmana, en, la, divina, comedia, islamic, eschatology, in, the, divine, comedy, an, account, of, parallels, between, early, islamic, philosophy, and, the, divine, comedy, palacios, argued, that, dante, derived, many, features, of, and, episodes, about, the, hereafter, from, the, spiritual, writings, of, ibn, arabi, and, from, the, isra, and, mi, raj, or, night, journey, of, muhammad, to, heaven, the, latter, is, described, in, the, ahadith, and, the, kitab, al, miraj, translated, into, latin, in, 1264, or, shortly, before, as, liber, scalae, machometi, the, book, of, muhammad, s, ladder, and, has, significant, similarities, to, the, paradiso, such, as, a, sevenfold, division, of, paradise, although, this, is,
