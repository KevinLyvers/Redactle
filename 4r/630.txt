refers, to, the, silence, of, god, which, is, a, major, theme, of, the, film, the, seventh, seal, is, considered, a, classic, of, world, cinema, as, well, as, one, of, the, greatest, films, of, all, time, it, established, bergman, as, a, world, renowned, director, containing, scenes, which, have, become, iconic, through, homages, critical, analysis, and, parodies, disillusioned, knight, antonius, block, and, his, cynical, squire, j, ns, return, from, the, crusades, to, find, the, country, ravaged, by, the, plague, the, knight, encounters, death, whom, he, challenges, to, a, chess, match,

fresco, of, the, danse, macabre, is, being, painted, the, squire, chides, the, artist, for, colluding, in, the, ideological, fervor, that, led, to, the, crusade, in, the, confessional, block, tells, the, priest, he, wants, to, perform, one, meaningful, deed, after, what, he, now, sees, as, a, pointless, life, upon, revealing, to, him, the, chess, tactic, that, will, save, his, life, the, knight, discovers, that, it, is, actually, death, with, whom, he, has, been, speaking, leaving, the, church, block, speaks, to, a, young, woman, condemned, to, be, burned, at, the, stake, for, consorting, with, the, devil, he, believes, she, will, tell, him, about, life, beyond, death, only, to, find, that, she, is, insane, in, a, deserted, village, j, ns, saves, a, mute, servant, girl, from, being,

preacher, who, harangues, the, townspeople, at, the, town, s, inn, raval, manipulates, plog, and, other, customers, into, intimidating, jof, the, bullying, is, broken, up, by, j, ns, who, slashes, raval, s, face, the, knight, and, squire, are, joined, by, jof, s, family, and, a, repentant, plog, block, enjoys, a, picnic, of, milk, and, wild, strawberries, that, mia, has, gathered, and, promises, to, remember, that, evening, for, the, rest, of, his, life, he, then, invites, plog, and, the, actors, to, shelter, from, the, plague, in, his, castle, when, they, encounter, skat, and, lisa, in, the, forest, she, returns, to, plog, while, skat, fakes, a, remorseful, suicide, as, the, group, moves, on, skat, climbs, a, tree, to, spend, the, night, but, death, appears, beneath, and, cuts, down, the, tree, meeting, the, condemned, woman, being, drawn, to, execution, block, asks, her, to, summon, satan, so, he, can, question, him, about, god, the, girl, claims, she, has, done, so, but, the, knight, only, sees, her, terror, and, gives, her, herbs, to, take, away, her, pain, as, she, is, placed, on, the, pyre, they, encounter, raval, stricken, by, the, plague, j, ns, stops, the, servant, girl, from, uselessly, bringing, him, water, and, raval, dies, alone, jof, then, sees, the, knight, playing, chess, with, death, and, decides, to, flee, with, his, family, while, block, knowingly, keeps, death, occupied, as, death, states, no, one, escapes, me, block, knocks, the, chess, pieces, over, but, death, restores, them, to, their, place, on, the, next, move, death, wins, the, game, and, announces, that, when, they, meet, again, it, will, be, the, last, time, for, all, death, then, asks, block, if, he, achieved, the, meaningful, deed, he, wished, to, accomplish, the, knight, replies, that, he, has, block, is, reunited, with, his, wife, and, the, party, shares, a, final, supper, interrupted, by, death, s, arrival, the, other, members, of, the, party, then, introduce, themselves, and, the, mute, servant, girl, greets, him, with, it, is, finished, jof, and, his, family, have, sheltered, in, their, caravan, from, a, storm, which, he, interprets, as, the, angel, of, death, passing, by, in, the, morning, jof, sees, a, vision, of, the, knight, and, his, companions, being, led, away, over, the, hillside, in, a, dance, of, death, the, title, refers, to, a, passage, about, the, end, of, the, world, from, the, book, of, revelation, used, both, at, the, very, start, of, the, film, and, again, towards, the, end, beginning, with, the, words, and, when, the, lamb, had, opened, the, seventh, seal, there, was, silence, in, heaven, about, the, space, of, half, an, hour, revelation, 8, 1, thus, in, the, confessional, scene, the, knight, states, is, it, so, cruelly, inconceivable, to, grasp, god, with, the, senses, why, should, he, hide, himself, in, a, mist, of, half, spoken, promises, and, unseen, miracles, what, is, going, to, happen, to, those, of, us, who, want, to, believe, but, aren, t, able, to, death, impersonating, the, confessional, priest, refuses, to, reply, similarly, later, as, he, eats, the, strawberries, with, the, family, of, actors, antonius, block, states, faith, is, a, torment, did, you, know, that, it, is, like, loving, someone, who, is, out, there, in, the, darkness, but, never, appears, no, matter, how, loudly, you, call, melvyn, bragg, notes, that, the, concept, of, the, silence, of, god, in, the, face, of, evil, or, the, pleas, of, believers, or, would, be, believers, may, be, influenced, by, the, punishments, of, silence, meted, out, by, bergman, s, father, a, chaplain, in, the, state, lutheran, church, in, bergman, s, original, radio, play, sometimes, translated, as, a, painting, on, wood, the, figure, of, death, in, a, dance, of, death, is, represented, not, by, an, actor, but, by, silence, mere, nothingness, mere, absence, terrifying, the, void, some, of, the, powerful, influences, on, the, film, were, picasso, s, picture, of, the, two, acrobats, carl, orff, s, carmina, burana, strindberg, s, dramas, folkungasagan, the, saga, of, the, folkung, kings, and, the, road, to, damascus, the, frescoes, at, h, rkeberga, church, and, a, painting, by, albertus, pictor, in, t, by, church, just, prior, to, shooting, bergman, directed, for, radio, the, play, everyman, by, hugo, von, hofmannsthal, by, this, time, he, had, also, directed, plays, by, shakespeare, strindberg, camus, chesterton, anouilh, tennessee, williams, pirandello, leh, r, moli, re, and, ostrovsky, the, actors, bibi, andersson, with, whom, bergman, was, in, a, relationship, from, 1955, to, 1959, who, played, the, juggler, s, wife, mia, and, max, von, sydow, whose, role, as, the, knight, was, the, first, of, many, star, parts, he, would, bring, to, bergman, s, films, and, whose, rugged, nordic, dignity, became, a, vital, resource, within, bergman, s, troupe, of, key, actors, both, made, a, strong, impact, on, the, mood, and, style, of, the, film, bergman, grew, up, in, a, home, infused, with, an, intense, christianity, his, father, being, a, charismatic, rector, this, may, have, explained, bergman, s, adolescent, infatuation, with, hitler, which, later, deeply, tormented, him, as, a, six, year, old, child, bergman, used, to, help, the, gardener, carry, corpses, from, the, royal, hospital, sophiahemmet, where, his, father, was, chaplain, to, the, mortuary, when, as, a, boy, he, saw, the, film, black, beauty, the, fire, scene, excited, him, so, much, he, stayed, in, bed, for, three, days, with, a, temperature, despite, living, a, bohemian, lifestyle, in, partial, rebellion, against, his, upbringing, bergman, often, signed, his, scripts, with, the, initials, s, d, g, soli, deo, gloria, to, god, alone, the, glory, just, as, j, s, bach, did, at, the, end, of, every, musical, composition, gerald, mast, writes, like, the, gravedigger, in, hamlet, the, squire, treats, death, as, a, bitter, and, hopeless, joke, since, we, all, play, chess, with, death, and, since, we, all, must, suffer, through, that, hopeless, joke, the, only, question, about, the, game, is, how, long, it, will, last, and, how, well, we, will, play, it, to, play, it, well, to, live, is, to, love, and, not, to, hate, the, body, and, the, mortal, as, the, church, urges, in, bergman, s, metaphor, melvyn, bragg, writes, t, is, constructed, like, an, argument, it, is, a, story, told, as, a, sermon, might, be, delivered, an, allegory, each, scene, is, at, once, so, simple, and, so, charged, and, layered, that, it, catches, us, again, and, again, somehow, all, of, bergman, s, own, past, that, of, his, father, that, of, his, reading, and, doing, and, seeing, that, of, his, swedish, culture, of, his, political, burning, and, religious, melancholy, poured, into, a, series, of, pictures, which, carry, that, swell, of, contributions, and, contradictions, so, effortlessly, that, you, could, tell, the, story, to, a, child, publish, it, as, a, storybook, of, photographs, and, yet, know, that, the, deepest, questions, of, religion, and, the, most, mysterious, revelation, of, simply, being, alive, are, both, addressed, the, jesuit, publication, america, identifies, it, as, having, begun, a, series, of, seven, films, that, explored, the, possibility, of, faith, in, a, post, holocaust, nuclear, age, likewise, film, historians, thomas, w, bohn, and, richard, l, stromgren, identify, this, film, as, beginning, his, cycle, of, films, dealing, with, the, conundrum, of, religious, faith, medieval, sweden, as, portrayed, in, this, movie, includes, creative, anachronisms, the, flagellant, movement, was, foreign, to, sweden, and, large, scale, witch, persecutions, only, began, in, the, 15th, century, in, addition, the, main, period, of, the, crusades, is, well, before, this, era, they, took, place, in, a, more, optimistic, period, with, regard, to, the, relevancy, of, historical, accuracy, to, a, film, that, is, heavily, metaphorical, and, allegorical, john, aberth, writing, in, a, knight, at, the, movies, holds, the, film, only, partially, succeeds, in, conveying, the, period, atmosphere, and, thought, world, of, the, fourteenth, century, bergman, would, probably, counter, that, it, was, never, his, intention, to, make, an, historical, or, period, film, as, it, was, written, in, a, program, note, that, accompanied, the, movie, s, premier, it, is, a, modern, poem, presented, with, medieval, material, that, has, been, very, freely, handled, the, script, in, particular, embodies, a, mid, twentieth, century, existentialist, angst, still, to, be, fair, to, bergman, one, must, allow, him, his, artistic, license, and, the, script, s, modernisms, may, be, justified, as, giving, the, movie, s, medieval, theme, a, compelling, and, urgent, contemporary, relevance, yet, the, film, succeeds, to, a, large, degree, because, it, is, set, in, the, middle, ages, a, time, that, can, seem, both, very, remote, and, very, immediate, to, us, living, in, the, modern, world, ultimately, the, seventh, seal, should, be, judged, as, a, historical, film, by, how, well, it, combines, the, medieval, and, the, modern, similarly, defending, it, as, an, allegory, aleksander, kwiatkowski, in, the, book, swedish, film, classics, writes, the, international, response, to, the, film, which, among, other, awards, won, the, jury, s, special, prize, at, cannes, in, 1957, reconfirmed, the, author, s, high, rank, and, proved, that, the, seventh, seal, regardless, of, its, degree, of, accuracy, in, reproducing, medieval, scenery, may, be, considered, as, a, universal, timeless, allegory, much, of, the, film, s, imagery, is, derived, from, medieval, art, for, example, bergman, has, stated, that, the, image, of, a, man, playing, chess, with, a, skeletal, death, was, inspired, by, a, medieval, church, painting, from, the, 1480s, in, t, by, kyrka, t, by, north, of, stockholm, painted, by, albertus, pictor, generally, speaking, historians, johan, huizinga, friedrich, heer, and, barbara, tuchman, have, all, argued, that, the, late, middle, ages, of, the, 14th, century, was, a, period, of, doom, and, gloom, similar, to, what, is, reflected, in, this, film, characterized, by, a, feeling, of, pessimism, an, increase, in, a, penitential, style, of, piety, that, was, slightly, masochistic, all, aggravated, by, various, disasters, such, as, the, black, death, famine, the, hundred, years, war, between, france, and, england, and, the, papal, schism, this, is, sometimes, called, the, crisis, of, the, late, middle, ages, and, tuchman, regards, the, 14th, century, as, a, distant, mirror, of, the, 20th, century, in, a, way, that, echoes, bergman, s, sensibilities, ingmar, bergman, originally, wrote, the, play, tr, m, lning, wood, painting, in, 1953, 1954, for, the, acting, students, of, malm, city, theatre, its, first, public, performance, which, he, directed, was, on, radio, in, 1954, he, also, directed, it, on, stage, in, malm, the, next, spring, and, in, the, autumn, it, was, staged, in, stockholm, directed, by, bengt, ekerot, who, would, later, play, the, character, death, in, the, film, version, in, his, autobiography, the, magic, lantern, bergman, wrote, that, wood, painting, gradually, became, the, seventh, seal, an, uneven, film, which, lies, close, to, my, heart, because, it, was, made, under, difficult, circumstances, in, a, surge, of, vitality, and, delight, the, script, for, the, seventh, seal, was, commenced, while, bergman, was, in, the, karolinska, hospital, in, stockholm, recovering, from, a, stomach, complaint, it, was, at, first, rejected, by, carl, anders, dymling, head, of, svensk, filmindustri, and, bergman, was, given, the, go, ahead, for, the, project, from, carl, anders, dymling, only, after, the, success, at, cannes, of, smiles, of, a, summer, night, bergman, rewrote, the, script, five, times, and, was, given, a, schedule, of, only, thirty, five, days, and, a, budget, of, 150, 000, it, was, to, be, the, seventeenth, film, he, had, directed, all, scenes, except, two, were, shot, in, or, around, the, filmstaden, studios, in, solna, the, exceptions, were, the, famous, opening, scene, with, death, and, the, knight, playing, chess, by, the, sea, and, the, ending, with, the, dance, of, death, which, were, both, shot, at, hovs, hallar, a, rocky, precipitous, beach, area, in, north, western, scania, in, the, magic, lantern, autobiography, bergman, writes, of, the, film, s, iconic, penultimate, shot, the, image, of, the, dance, of, death, beneath, the, dark, cloud, was, achieved, at, hectic, speed, because, most, of, the, actors, had, finished, for, the, day, assistants, electricians, and, a, make, up, man, and, about, two, summer, visitors, who, never, knew, what, it, was, all, about, had, to, dress, up, in, the, costumes, of, those, condemned, to, death, a, camera, with, no, sound, was, set, up, and, the, picture, shot, before, the, cloud, dissolved, upon, its, original, swedish, release, the, seventh, seal, was, met, with, a, somewhat, divided, critical, response, its, cinematography, was, widely, praised, while, bergman, the, scriptwriter, lambasted, the, film, won, the, nastro, d, argento, for, best, non, italian, film, in, 1961, swedish, journalist, and, critic, nils, beyer, writing, for, morgon, tidningen, compared, it, to, carl, theodor, dreyer, s, the, passion, of, joan, of, arc, and, day, of, wrath, while, finding, dreyer, s, films, to, be, superior, he, still, noted, that, it, isn, t, just, any, director, that, you, feel, like, comparing, to, the, old, danish, master, he, also, praised, the, usage, of, the, cast, in, particular, max, von, sydow, whose, character, he, described, as, a, pale, serious, don, quixote, character, with, a, face, as, if, sculpted, in, wood, and, bibi, andersson, who, appears, as, if, painted, in, faded, watercolours, but, still, can, emit, small, delicious, glimpses, of, female, warmth, hanserik, hjert, n, for, arbetaren, started, his, review, by, praising, the, cinematography, but, soon, went, on, to, describe, the, film, as, a, horror, film, for, children, and, said, that, beyond, the, superficial, it, is, mostly, reminiscent, of, bergman, s, sophomoric, films, from, the, 40s, bergman, s, international, reputation, on, the, other, hand, was, largely, cemented, by, the, seventh, seal, the, film, ranked, 2nd, on, cahiers, du, cin, ma, s, top, 10, films, of, the, year, list, in, 1958, bosley, crowther, had, only, positive, things, to, say, in, his, 1958, review, for, the, new, york, times, and, praised, how, the, themes, were, elevated, by, the, cinematography, and, performances, the, profundities, of, the, ideas, are, lightened, and, made, flexible, by, glowing, pictorial, presentation, of, action, that, is, interesting, and, strong, mr, bergman, uses, his, camera, and, actors, for, sharp, realistic, effects, film, critic, pauline, kael, called, it, a, magically, powerful, film, the, film, is, now, regarded, as, a, masterpiece, of, cinema, the, village,

to, people, trained, in, literary, culture, who, were, just, beginning, to, discover, the, art, of, film, and, it, quickly, became, a, staple, of, high, school, and, college, literature, courses, unlike, hollywood, movies, the, seventh, seal, clearly, was, aware, of, elite, artistic, culture, and, thus, was, readily, appreciated, by, intellectual, audiences, the, representation, of, death, as,
