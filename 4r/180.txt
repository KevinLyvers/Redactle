pronouncements, of, abigail, and, the, other, girls, john, knows, their, apparent, possession, and, accusations, of, witchcraft, are, untrue, as, abigail, told, him, as, much, when, they, were, alone, together, in, the, first, act, but, is, unsure, of, how, to, confess, without, revealing, the, affair, elizabeth, is, disconcerted, to, learn, her, husband, was, alone, with, abigail, she, believes, john, still, lusts, after, abigail, and, tells, him, that, as, long, as, he, does, he, will, never, redeem, himself, mary, warren, enters, and, gives, elizabeth, a, poppet, doll, like, puppet, that, she, made, in, court, that, day, while, sitting, as, a, witness, mary, tells, that, thirty, nine, have, been, arrested, so, far, accused, as, witches, and, they, might, be, hanged, mary, also, tells, that, goody, osborne, will, be, hanged, but, sarah, good, s, life, is, safe, because, she, confessed, that, she, made, a, compact, with, lucifer, satan, to, torment, christians, angered, that, mary, is, neglecting, her, duties, john, threatens, to, beat, her, mary, retorts, that, she, is, now, an, official, in, the, court, she, must, have, to, go, there, on, daily, basis, and, she, saved, elizabeth, s, life, that, day, as, elizabeth, was, accused, of, witchcraft, and, was, to, be, arrested, until, mary, spoke, in, her, defense, mary, refuses, to, identify, elizabeth, s, accuser, but, elizabeth, surmises, accurately, that, it, must, have, been, abigail, she, implores, john, to, go, to, court, and, tell, the, judges, that, abigail, and, the, rest, of, the, girls, are, pretending, john, is, reluctant, fearing, that, doing, so, will, require, him, to, publicly, reveal, his, past, adultery, reverend, hale, arrives, stating, that, he, is, interviewing, all, the, people, named, in, the, proceedings, including, elizabeth, he, mentions, that, rebecca, nurse, was, also, named, but, admits, that, he, doubts, her, a, witch, due, to, her, extreme, piousness, though, he, emphasizes, that, anything, is, possible, hale, is, skeptical, about, the, proctors, devotion, to, christianity, noting, that, they, do, not, attend, church, regularly, and, that, one, of, their, three, sons, has, not, yet, been, baptized, john, replies, that, this, is, because, he, has, no, respect, for, parris, challenged, to, recite, the, ten, commandments, john, fatefully, forgets, thou, shalt, not, commit, adultery, when, hale, questions, her, elizabeth, is, angered, that, he, does, not, question, abigail, first, unsure, of, how, to, proceed, hale, prepares, to, take, his, leave, at, elizabeth, s, urging, john, tells, hale, he, knows, that, the, girls, afflictions, are, fake, when, hale, responds, that, many, of, the, accused, have, confessed, john, points, out, that, they, were, bound, to, be, hanged, if, they, did, not, hale, reluctantly, acknowledges, this, point, suddenly, giles, corey, and, francis, nurse, enter, the, house, and, inform, john, and, hale, that, both, of, their, wives, have, been, arrested, on, charges, of, witchcraft, respectively, martha, corey, for, reading, suspicious, books, and, rebecca, nurse, has, been, suspected, of, sacrificing, children, a, posse, led, by, clerk, ezekiel, cheever, and, town, marshal, george, herrick, arrive, soon, afterwards, and, present, a, warrant, for, elizabeth, s, arrest, much, to, hale, s, surprise, cheever, picks, up, the, poppet, on, elizabeth, s, table, and, finds, a, needle, inside, he, informs, john, that, abigail, had, a, pain, induced, fit, earlier, that, evening, and, a, needle, was, found, stuck, into, her, stomach, abigail, claimed, that, elizabeth, stabbed, her, with, the, needle, through, witchcraft, using, a, poppet, as, a, conduit, john, brings, mary, into, the, room, to, tell, the, truth, mary, asserts, that, she, made, the, doll, and, stuck, the, needle, into, it, and, that, abigail, saw, her, do, so, cheever, is, unconvinced, and, prepares, to, arrest, elizabeth, john, becomes, greatly, angered, tearing, the, arrest, warrant, to, shreds, and, threatening, herrick, and, cheever, with, a, musket, until, elizabeth, calms, him, down, and, surrenders, herself, he, calls, hale, a, coward, and, asks, him, why, the, accusers, every, utterance, goes, unchallenged, hale, is, conflicted, but, suggests, that, perhaps, this, misfortune, has, befallen, salem, because, of, a, great, secret, crime, that, must, be, brought, to, light, taking, this, to, heart, john, orders, mary, to, go, to, court, with, him, and, expose, the, other, girls, lies, and, she, protests, vehemently, aware, of, john, s, affair, she, warns, him, that, abigail, is, willing, to, expose, it, if, necessary, john, is, shocked, but, determines, the, truth, must, prevail, whatever, the, personal, cost, the, third, act, takes, place, thirty, seven, days, later, in, the, general, court, of, salem, during, the, trial, of, martha, corey, francis, and, giles, desperately, interrupt, the, proceedings, demanding, to, be, heard, the, court, is, recessed, and, the, men, thrown, out, of, the, main, room, reconvening, in, an, adjacent, room, john, proctor, arrives, with, mary, warren, and, they, inform, deputy, governor, danforth, and, judge, hathorne, about, the, girls, lies, danforth, then, informs, an, unaware, john, that, elizabeth, is, pregnant, and, promises, to, spare, her, from, execution, until, the, child, is, born, hoping, to, persuade, john, to, withdraw, his, case, john, refuses, to, back, down, and, submits, a, deposition, signed, by, ninety, one, locals, attesting, to, the, good, character, of, elizabeth, rebecca, nurse, and, martha, corey, herrick, also, attests, to, john, s, truthfulness, as, well, the, deposition, is, dismissed, by, parris, and, hathorne, as, illegal, rev, hale, criticizes, the, decision, and, demands, to, know, why, the, accused, are, forbidden, to, defend, themselves, danforth, replies, that, given, the, invisible, nature, of, witchcraft, the, word, of, the, accused, and, their, advocates, cannot, be, trusted, he, then, orders, that, all, ninety, one, persons, named, in, the, deposition, be, arrested, for, questioning, giles, corey, submits, his, own, deposition, accusing, thomas, putnam, of, forcing, his, daughter, to, accuse, george, jacobs, in, order, to, buy, up, his, land, as, convicted, witches, have, to, forfeit, all, of, their, property, when, asked, by, hathorne, to, reveal, the, source, of, his, information, giles, refuses, fearing, that, he, or, she, will, also, be, arrested, when, danforth, threatens, him, with, arrest, for, contempt, giles, argues, that, he, cannot, be, arrested, for, contempt, of, a, hearing, danforth, then, declares, the, court, in, session, and, giles, is, arrested, john, submits, mary, s, deposition, which, declares, that, she, was, coerced, to, accuse, people, by, abigail, abigail, denies, mary, s, assertions, that, they, are, pretending, and, stands, by, her, story, about, the, poppet, when, challenged, by, parris, and, hathorne, to, pretend, to, be, possessed, mary, is, too, afraid, to, comply, john, attacks, abigail, s, character, revealing, that, she, and, the, other, girls, were, caught, dancing, naked, in, the, woods, by, rev, parris, on, the, night, of, betty, parris, alleged, bewitchment, when, danforth, begins, to, question, abigail, she, claims, that, mary, has, begun, to, bewitch, her, with, a, cold, wind, and, john, loses, his, temper, calling, abigail, a, whore, he, confesses, their, affair, says, abigail, was, fired, from, his, household, over, it, and, that, abigail, is, trying, to, murder, elizabeth, so, that, she, may, dance, with, me, on, my, wife, s, grave, danforth, brings, elizabeth, in, to, confirm, this, story, beforehand, forbidding, anyone, to, tell, her, about, john, s, testimony, unaware, of, john, s, public, confession, elizabeth, fears, that, abigail, has, revealed, the, affair, in, order, to, discredit, john, and, lies, saying, that, there, was, no, affair, and, that, she, fired, abigail, out, of, wild, suspicion, hale, begs, danforth, to, reconsider, his, judgement, now, agreeing, abigail, is, false, but, to, no, avail, danforth, throws, out, this, testimony, based, solely, upon, john, s, earlier, assertion, that, elizabeth, would, never, tell, a, lie, confusion, and, hysteria, begin, to, overtake, the, room, abigail, and, the, girls, run, about, screaming, claiming, mary, s, spirit, is, attacking, them, in, the, form, of, a, yellow, bird, which, nobody, else, is, able, to, see, when, danforth, tells, the, increasingly, distraught, mary, that, he, will, sentence, her, to, hang, she, joins, with, the, other, girls, and, recants, all, her, allegations, against, them, claiming, john, proctor, forced, her, to, turn, her, against, the, others, and, that, he, harbors, the, devil, john, in, despair, and, having, given, up, all, hope, declares, that, god, is, dead, and, is, arrested, furious, reverend, hale, denounces, the, proceedings, and, quits, the, court, act, four, takes, place, three, months, later, in, the, town, jail, early, in, the, morning, tituba, sharing, a, cell, with, sarah, good, appears, to, have, gone, insane, from, all, of, the, hysteria, hearing, voices, and, now, actually, claiming, to, talk, to, satan, marshal, herrick, depressed, at, having, arrested, so, many, of, his, neighbors, has, turned, to, alcoholism, many, villagers, have, been, charged, with, witchcraft, most, have, confessed, and, been, given, lengthy, prison, terms, and, their, property, seized, by, the, government, twelve, have, been, executed, seven, more, are, to, be, hanged, at, sunrise, for, refusing, to, confess, including, john, proctor, rebecca, nurse, and, martha, corey, giles, corey, was, tortured, to, death, by, pressing, as, the, court, tried, in, vain, to, extract, a, plea, though, by, holding, out, giles, ensured, that, his, sons, would, receive, his, land, and, possessions, the, village, has, become, dysfunctional, with, so, many, people, in, prison, or, dead, and, with, the, arrival, of, news, of, rebellion, against, the, courts, in, nearby, andover, massachusetts, whispers, abound, of, an, uprising, in, salem, abigail, fearful, of, the, consequences, steals, parris, s, life, savings, and, boards, a, ship, to, england, with, mercy, lewis, danforth, and, hathorne, have, returned, to, salem, to, meet, with, parris, and, are, surprised, to, learn, that, hale, has, returned, and, is, meeting, with, the, condemned, parris, who, has, lost, everything, to, abigail, reports, that, he, has, received, death, threats, he, begs, danforth, to, postpone, the, executions, in, order, to, secure, confessions, hoping, to, avoid, executing, some, of, salem, s, most, highly, regarded, citizens, hale, deeply, remorseful, and, blaming, himself, for, the, hysteria, has, returned, to, counsel, the, condemned, to, falsely, confess, and, avoid, execution, he, presses, danforth, to, pardon, the, remaining, seven, and, put, the, entire, affair, behind, them, danforth, refuses, stating, that, pardons, or, postponement, would, cast, doubt, on, the, veracity, of, previous, confessions, and, hangings, danforth, and, hale, summon, elizabeth, and, ask, her, to, persuade, john, to, confess, she, is, bitter, towards, hale, both, for, doubting, her, earlier, and, for, wanting, john, to, give, in, and, ruin, his, good, name, but, agrees, to, speak, with, her, husband, if, only, to, say, goodbye, she, and, john, have, a, lengthy, discussion, during, which, she, commends, him, for, holding, out, and, not, confessing, john, says, he, is, refusing, to, confess, not, out, of, religious, conviction, but, through, contempt, for, his, accusers, and, the, court, the, two, finally, reconcile, with, elizabeth, forgiving, john, and, saddened, by, the, thought, that, he, cannot, forgive, himself, and, see, his, own, goodness, knowing, in, his, heart, that, it, is, the, wrong, thing, for, him, to, do, john, agrees, to, falsely, confess, to, engaging, in, witchcraft, deciding, that, he, has, no, desire, or, right, to, be, a, martyr, danforth, hathorne, and, a, relieved, parris, ask, john, to, testify, to, the, guilt, of, the, other, hold, outs, and, the, executed, john, refuses, saying, he, can, only, report, on, his, own, sins, danforth, is, disappointed, by, this, reluctance, but, at, the, urging, of, hale, and, parris, allows, john, to, sign, a, written, confession, to, be, displayed, on, the, church, door, as, an, example, john, is, wary, thinking, his, verbal, confession, is, sufficient, as, they, press, him, further, john, eventually, signs, but, refuses, to, hand, the, paper, over, stating, he, does, not, want, his, family, and, especially, his, three, sons, to, be, stigmatized, by, the, public, confession, the, men, argue, until, proctor, renounces, his, confession, entirely, ripping, up, the, signed, document, danforth, calls, for, the, sheriff, and, john, is, led, away, to, be, hanged, facing, an, imminent, rebellion, putnam, and, parris, frantically, run, out, to, beg, proctor, to, confess, hale, guilty, over, john, s, death, pleads, with, elizabeth, to, talk, john, around, but, she, refuses, stating, john, has, found, his, goodness, during, the, mccarthy, era, german, jewish, novelist, and, playwright, lion, feuchtwanger, became, the, target, of, suspicion, as, a, left, wing, intellectual, during, his, exile, in, the, us, in, 1947, feuchtwanger, wrote, a, play, about, the, salem, witch, trials, wahn, oder, der, teufel, in, boston, delusion, or, the, devil, in, boston, as, an, allegory, for, the, persecution, of, communists, thus, anticipating, the, theme, of, the, crucible, by, arthur, miller, wahn, premiered, in, germany, in, 1949, it, was, translated, by, june, barrows, mussey, and, performed, in, los, angeles, in, 1953, under, the, title, the, devil, in, boston, p, 374, note, 6, in, 1953, the, year, the, play, debuted, miller, wrote, the, crucible, is, taken, from, history, no, character, is, in, the, play, who, did, not, take, a, similar, role, in, salem, 1692, this, does, not, appear, to, be, accurate, as, miller, made, both, deliberate, changes, and, incidental, mistakes, abigail, williams, age, was, increased, from, 11, or, 12, to, 17, probably, to, add, credence, to, the, backstory, of, proctor, s, affair, with, abigail, john, proctor, himself, was, 60, years, old, in, 1692, but, portrayed, as, much, younger, in, the, play, for, the, same, reason, miller, claimed, in, a, note, on, the, historical, accuracy, of, this, play, that, while, there, were, several, judges, of, almost, equal, authority, i, have, symbolized, them, all, in, hathorne, and, danforth, however, this, conflates, danforth, with, the, historical, and, extremely, influential, figure, of, william, stoughton, who, is, not, a, character, and, is, only, briefly, mentioned, in, the, play, both, men, were, subsequent, deputy, governors, but, it, was, stoughton, who, alone, among, the, judges, was, a, bachelor, who, never, married, who, ordered, further, deliberations, after, the, jury, initially, acquitted, rebecca, nurse, he, refused, to, ever, acknowledge, that, the, trials, had, been, anything, other, than, a, success, and, was, infuriated, when, governor, phips, whose, own, wife, somehow, had, been, named, as, a, possible, witch, ended, the, trials, for, good, and, released, the, prisoners, danforth, did, not, sit, on, the, court, of, oyer, and, terminer, in, fact, he, is, recorded, as, being, critical, of, the, conduct, of, the, trials, and, played, a, role, in, bringing, them, to, an, end, in, the, play, thomas, and, especially, ann, putnam, are, disconsolate, over, the, fact, that, only, one, of, their, children, has, survived, to, adolescence, in, real, life, the, putnams, who, both, died, in, 1699, were, survived, by, ten, of, their, twelve, children, including, ann, jr, thomas, putnam, s, conduct, during, the, witch, trial, hysteria, has, been, amply, documented, to, have, been, almost, entirely, due, to, financial, motivations, and, score, settling, something, the, play, only, makes, reference, to, after, introducing, the, putnams, fictional, deceased, offspring, as, part, of, the, plot, narrative, in, the, 1953, essay, journey, to, the, crucible, miller, writes, of, visiting, salem, and, feeling, like, the, only, one, interested, in, what, really, happened, in, 1692, many, of, miller, s, characters, were, based, on, people, who, had, little, in, the, public, record, other, than, their, statements, from, the, trials, but, others, survived, to, expand, recant, or, comment, on, the, role, they, played, at, salem, including, jurors, accusers, survivors, and, judges, rev, parris, issued, his, first, in, a, series, of, apologies, on, november, 26, 1694, and, was, removed, from, his, position, in, 1697, in, 1698, hale, finished, composing, a, lengthy, essay, about, salem, that, was, reprinted, by, george, burr, in, 1914, the, play, s, action, takes, place, 70, years, after, the, community, arrived, as, settlers, from, britain, the, people, on, whom, the, characters, are, based, would, have, retained, strong, regional, dialects, from, their, home, country, miller, gave, all, his, characters, the, same, colloquialisms, such, as, goody, or, goodwife, and, drew, on, the, rhythms, and, speech, patterns, of, the, king, james, bible, to, achieve, the, effect, of, historical, perspective, he, wanted, miller, originally, called, the, play, those, familiar, spirits, before, renaming, it, as, the, crucible, the, word, crucible, is, defined, as, a, severe, test, or, trial, alternately, a, container, in, which, metals, or, other, substances, are, subjected, to, high, temperatures, the, characters, whose, moral, standards, prevail, in, the, face, of, death, such, as, john, proctor, and, rebecca,
