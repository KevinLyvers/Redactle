talmud, to, be, a, divine, act, of, punishment, for, the, sins, of, the, jewish, people, the, temple, mount, lost, its, significance, for, christian, worship, with, the, christians, considering, it, a, fulfillment, of, christ, s, prophecy, at, for, example, matthew, 23, 38, and, matthew, 24, 2, it, was, to, this, end, proof, of, a, biblical, prophecy, fulfilled, and, of, christianity, s, victory, over, judaism, with, the, new, covenant, that, early, christian, pilgrims, also, visited, the, site, byzantine, christians, despite, some, signs, of, constructive, work, on, the, esplanade, generally, neglected, the, temple, mount, especially, when, a, jewish, attempt, to, rebuild, the, temple, was, destroyed, by, the, earthquake, of, 363, it, became, a, desolate, local, rubbish, dump, perhaps, outside, the, city, limits, as, christian, worship, in, jerusalem, shifted, to, the, church, of, the, holy, sepulchre, and, jerusalem, s, centrality, was, replaced, by, rome, during, the, byzantine, era, jerusalem, was, primarily, christian, and, pilgrims, came, by, the, tens, of, thousands, to, experience, the, places, where, jesus, walked, after, the, persian, invasion, in, 614, many, churches, were, razed, and, the, site, was, turned, into, a, dump, the, arabs, conquered, the, city, from, the, byzantine, empire, which, had, retaken, it, in, 629, the, byzantine, ban, on, the, jews, was, lifted, and, they, were, allowed, to, live, inside, the, city, and, visit, the, places, of, worship, christian, pilgrims, were, able, to, come, and, experience, the, temple, mount, area, the, war, between, seljuqs, and, byzantine, empire, and, increasing, muslim, violence, against, christian, pilgrims, to, jerusalem, instigated, the, crusades, the, crusaders, captured, jerusalem, in, 1099, and, the, dome, of, the, rock, was, given, to, the, augustinians, who, turned, it, into, a, church, and, al, aqsa, mosque, became, the, royal, palace, of, baldwin, i, of, jerusalem, in, 1104, the, knights, templar, who, believed, the, dome, of, the, rock, was, the, site, of, solomon, s, temple, gave, it, the, name, templum, domini, and, set, up, their, headquarters, in, al, aqsa, mosque, adjacent, to, the, dome, for, much, of, the, 12th, century, in, christian, art, the, circumcision, of, jesus, was, conventionally, depicted, as, taking, place, at, the, temple, even, though, european, artists, until, recently, had, no, way, of, knowing, what, the, temple, looked, like, and, the, gospels, do, not, state, that, the, event, took, place, at, the, temple, though, some, christians, believe, that, the, temple, will, be, reconstructed, before, or, concurrent, with, the, second, coming, of, jesus, also, see, dispensationalism, pilgrimage, to, the, temple, mount, is, not, viewed, as, important, in, the, beliefs, and, worship, of, most, christians, the, new, testament, recounts, a, story, of, a, samaritan, woman, asking, jesus, about, the, appropriate, place, to, worship, jerusalem, as, it, was, for, the, jews, or, mount, gerizim, as, it, was, for, the, samaritans, to, which, jesus, replies, woman, believe, me, the, hour, is, coming, when, neither, on, this, mountain, nor, in, jerusalem, will, you, worship, the, father, you, worship, what, you, do, not, know, we, worship, what, we, know, for, salvation, is, from, the, jews, but, the, hour, is, coming, and, is, now, here, when, the, true, worshipers, will, worship, the, father, in, spirit, and, in, truth, for, the, father, is, seeking, such, people, to, worship, him, god, is, spirit, and, those, who, worship, him, must, worship, in, spirit, and, truth, this, has, been, construed, to, mean, that, jesus, dispensed, with, physical, location, for, worship, which, was, a, matter, rather, of, spirit, and, truth, among, both, sunni, and, shia, muslims, the, entire, plaza, known, as, the, al, aqsa, mosque, also, known, as, haram, al, sharif, or, the, noble, sanctuary, is, considered, the, third, holiest, site, in, islam, according, to, islamic, tradition, the, plaza, is, the, location, of, muhammad, s, ascension, to, heaven, from, jerusalem, and, served, as, the, first, qibla, the, direction, muslims, turn, towards, when, praying, as, in, judaism, muslims, also, associate, the, site, with, abraham, and, other, prophets, who, are, also, venerated, in, islam, muslims, view, the, site, as, being, one, of, the, earliest, and, most, noteworthy, places, of, worship, of, god, they, preferred, to, use, the, esplanade, as, the, heart, for, the, muslim, quarter, since, it, had, been, abandoned, by, christians, to, avoid, disturbing, the, christian, quarters, of, jerusalem, umayyad, caliphs, commissioned, the, construction, of, al, aqsa, mosque, on, the, site, including, the, shrine, known, as, the, dome, of, the, rock, the, dome, was, completed, in, 692, ce, making, it, one, of, the, oldest, extant, islamic, structures, in, the, world, the, al, aqsa, mosque, sometimes, known, as, the, qibli, mosque, rest, on, the, far, southern, side, of, the, mount, facing, mecca, early, islam, regarded, the, foundation, stone, as, the, location, of, solomon, s, temple, and, the, first, architectural, initiatives, on, the, temple, mount, sought, to, glorify, jerusalem, by, presenting, islam, as, a, continuation, of, judaism, and, christianity, almost, immediately, after, the, muslim, conquest, of, jerusalem, in, 638, ce, caliph, omar, ibn, al, khatab, reportedly, disgusted, by, the, filth, covering, the, site, had, it, thoroughly, cleaned, and, granted, jews, access, to, the, site, according, to, early, quranic, interpreters, and, what, is, generally, accepted, as, islamic, tradition, in, 638, ce, umar, upon, entering, a, conquered, jerusalem, consulted, with, ka, ab, al, ahbar, a, jewish, convert, to, islam, who, came, with, him, from, medina, as, to, where, the, best, spot, would, be, to, build, a, mosque, al, ahbar, suggested, to, him, that, it, should, be, behind, the, rock, so, that, all, of, jerusalem, would, be, before, you, umar, replied, you, correspond, to, judaism, immediately, after, this, conversation, umar, began, to, clean, up, the, site, which, was, filled, with, trash, and, debris, with, his, cloak, and, other, muslim, followers, imitated, him, until, the, site, was, clean, umar, then, prayed, at, the, spot, where, it, was, believed, that, muhammad, had, prayed, before, his, night, journey, reciting, the, quranic, sura, sad, thus, according, to, this, tradition, umar, thereby, reconsecrated, the, site, as, a, mosque, muslim, interpretations, of, the, quran, agree, that, the, mount, is, the, site, of, the, temple, originally, built, by, solomon, considered, a, prophet, in, islam, that, was, later, destroyed, after, the, construction, muslims, believe, the, temple, was, used, for, the, worship, of, the, one, god, by, many, prophets, of, islam, including, jesus, other, muslim, scholars, have, used, the, torah, called, tawrat, in, arabic, to, expand, on, the, details, of, the, temple, the, term, bayt, al, maqdis, or, bayt, al, muqaddas, which, frequently, appears, as, a, name, of, jerusalem, in, early, islamic, sources, is, a, cognate, of, the, hebrew, term, b, t, ha, miqd, sh, the, temple, in, jerusalem, mujir, al, din, a, 15th, century, jerusalemite, chronicler, mentions, an, earlier, tradition, related, by, al, wasti, according, which, after, david, built, many, cities, and, the, situation, of, the, children, of, israel, was, improved, he, wanted, to, construct, bayt, al, maqdis, and, build, a, dome, over, the, rock, in, the, place, that, allah, sanctified, in, aelia, according, to, the, qur, an, muhammad, was, transported, to, a, site, named, al, aqsa, mosque, the, furthest, place, of, prayer, al, masjid, al, aq, during, his, night, journey, isra, and, mi, raj, the, qur, an, describes, how, muhammad, was, taken, by, the, miraculous, steed, buraq, from, the, great, mosque, of, mecca, to, al, aqsa, mosque, where, he, prayed, after, muhammad, finished, his, prayers, the, angel, jibril, gabriel, traveled, with, him, to, heaven, where, he, met, several, other, prophets, and, led, them, in, prayer, glory, be, to, the, one, who, took, his, servant, mu, ammad, by, night, from, the, sacred, mosque, to, the, farthest, mosque, whose, surroundings, we, have, blessed, so, that, we, may, show, him, some, of, our, signs, indeed, he, alone, is, the, all, hearing, all, seeing, the, qur, an, does, not, mention, the, exact, location, of, the, furthest, place, of, prayer, and, the, city, of, jerusalem, is, not, mentioned, by, any, of, its, names, in, the, qur, an, according, to, the, encyclopaedia, of, islam, the, phrase, was, originally, understood, as, a, reference, to, a, site, in, the, heavens, a, group, of, islamic, scholars, understood, the, story, of, muhammad, s, ascension, from, al, aqsa, mosque, as, relating, to, the, jewish, temple, in, jerusalem, another, group, disagreed, with, this, identification, and, preferred, the, meaning, of, the, term, as, referring, to, heaven, al, bukhari, and, al, tabari, for, example, are, believed, to, have, rejected, the, identification, with, jerusalem, eventually, a, consensus, emerged, around, the, identification, of, the, furthest, place, of, prayer, with, jerusalem, and, by, implication, the, temple, mount, later, hadiths, referred, to, jerusalem, as, the, site, of, the, al, aqsa, mosque, narrated, jabir, bin, abdullah, that, he, heard, allah, s, messenger, saying, when, the, people, of, quraish, did, not, believe, me, i, e, the, story, of, my, night, journey, i, stood, up, in, al, hijr, and, allah, displayed, jerusalem, in, front, of, me, and, i, began, describing, it, to, them, while, i, was, looking, at, it, some, scholars, point, to, the, political, motives, of, the, umayyad, dynasty, which, led, to, the, sanctification, of, jerusalem, in, islam, according, to, the, encyclopaedia, of, islam, the, night, journey, was, associated, with, jerusalem, by, the, umayyads, as, a, political, means, to, advance, the, glory, of, jerusalem, to, compete, with, the, glory, of, the, sanctuary, in, mecca, then, controlled, by, abd, allah, ibn, al, zubayr, the, construction, of, the, dome, of, the, rock, was, interpreted, by, ya, qubi, a, 9th, century, abbasid, historian, as, an, umayyad, attempt, to, redirect, the, hajj, from, mecca, to, jerusalem, by, creating, a, rival, to, the, ka, aba, other, academics, attribute, the, holiness, of, jerusalem, to, the, rise, and, expansion, of, a, certain, type, of, literary, genre, known, as, al, fadhail, or, history, of, cities, the, fadhail, of, jerusalem, inspired, muslims, especially, during, the, umayyad, period, to, embellish, the, sanctity, of, the, city, beyond, its, status, in, the, holy, texts, based, on, the, writings, of, the, eighth, century, historians, al, waqidi, and, al, azraqi, some, scholars, have, suggested, that, al, aqsa, mosque, mentioned, in, the, qur, an, is, not, in, jerusalem, but, in, the, village, of, al, ju, ranah, 18, miles, northeast, of, mecca, later, medieval, scripts, as, well, as, modern, day, political, tracts, tend, to, classify, al, aqsa, mosque, as, the, third, holiest, site, in, islam, the, historical, significance, of, al, aqsa, mosque, in, islam, is, further, emphasized, by, the, fact, that, muslims, turned, towards, al, aqsa, when, they, prayed, for, a, period, of, 16, or, 17, months, after, migration, to, medina, in, 624, it, thus, became, the, qibla, direction, that, muslims, faced, for, prayer, muhammad, later, prayed, towards, the, kaaba, in, mecca, after, receiving, a, revelation, during, a, prayer, session, in, the, masjid, al, qiblatayn, the, qibla, was, relocated, to, the, kaaba, where, muslims, have, been, directed, to, pray, ever, since, the, organisation, of, islamic, cooperation, refers, to, al, aqsa, mosque, as, the, third, holiest, site, in, islam, and, calls, for, arab, sovereignty, over, it, the, hill, is, believed, to, have, been, inhabited, since, the, 4th, millennium, bce, an, amulet, bearing, the, cartouche, of, thutmose, iii, r, 1479, 1425, bce, was, discovered, by, the, temple, mount, sifting, project, at, the, site, in, 2012, according, to, archeologists, the, temple, mount, served, as, the, center, of, the, religious, life, of, biblical, jerusalem, as, well, as, the, royal, acropolis, of, the, kingdom, of, judah, the, first, temple, is, believed, to, have, once, been, a, part, of, a, much, larger, royal, complex, the, bible, also, mentions, several, other, buildings, constructed, by, solomon, at, the, site, including, the, royal, palace, the, house, of, the, lebanon, forest, the, hall, of, pillars, the, hall, of, throne, and, the, house, of, pharaoh, s, daughter, some, scholars, believe, that, in, accordance, with, biblical, accounts, the, royal, and, religious, compound, on, the, temple, mount, was, built, by, solomon, during, the, 10th, century, bce, as, a, separate, entity, which, was, later, incorporated, into, the, city, knauf, argued, that, the, temple, mount, already, served, as, the, cultic, and, governmental, center, of, jerusalem, as, early, as, in, the, late, bronze, age, alternatively, na, aman, suggested, that, solomon, built, the, temple, on, a, much, smaller, scale, than, the, one, described, in, the, bible, which, was, enlarged, or, rebuilt, during, the, 8th, century, bce, in, 2014, finkelstein, koch, and, lipschits, proposed, that, the, tell, of, ancient, jerusalem, lies, beneath, the, modern, day, compound, rather, than, the, nearby, archeological, site, known, as, the, city, of, david, as, mainstream, archaeology, believes, however, this, proposal, was, rejected, by, other, scholars, of, the, subject, all, scholars, agree, that, the, iron, age, temple, mount, was, smaller, than, the, herodian, compound, still, visible, today, some, scholars, such, as, kenyon, and, ritmeyer, argued, that, the, walls, of, the, first, temple, compound, extended, eastward, as, far, as, the, eastern, wall, ritmeyer, identifies, specific, courses, of, visible, ashlars, located, to, the, north, and, south, of, the, golden, gate, as, judean, iron, age, in, style, dating, them, to, the, construction, of, this, wall, by, hezekiah, more, such, stones, are, supposed, to, survive, underground, ritmeyer, has, also, suggested, that, one, of, the, steps, leading, to, the, dome, of, the, rock, is, actually, the, top, of, a, remaining, stone, course, of, the, western, wall, of, the, iron, age, compound, the, first, temple, was, destroyed, in, 587, 586, bce, by, the, neo, babylonian, empire, under, nebuchadnezzar, ii, construction, of, the, second, temple, began, under, cyrus, in, around, 538, bce, and, was, completed, in, 516, bce, it, was, built, at, the, original, site, of, solomon, s, temple, according, to, patrich, and, edelcopp, the, ideal, area, of, the, complex, described, in, ezekiel, as, 50x50, cubits, was, attained, by, the, hasmoneans, perhaps, under, john, hyrcanus, this, is, the, same, size, later, mentioned, by, the, mishnah, evidence, of, a, hasmonean, expansion, of, the, temple, mount, has, been, recovered, by, archaeologist, leen, ritmeyer, in, 67, bce, a, quarrel, broke, out, between, aristobulus, ii, and, hyrcanus, ii, on, the, hasmonean, throne, roman, general, pompey, who, had, been, invited, to, intervene, in, the, conflict, sided, with, hyrcanus, aristobulus, and, his, followers, barricaded, themselves, inside, the, temple, mount, and, destroyed, the, bridge, linking, it, to, the, city, when, the, roman, army, arrived, in, jerusalem, pompey, ordered, the, moat, defending, the, temple, mount, from, the, north, to, be, filled, in, to, accomplish, this, pompey, waited, for, sabbaths, so, the, defenders, would, not, disrupt, the, work, after, a, three, month, siege, the, romans, were, able, to, topple, one, of, the, guard, towers, and, storm, the, temple, mount, pompey, himself, entered, the, holy, of, holies, but, did, not, harm, the, temple, and, allowed, the, priests, to, continue, their, work, as, usual, around, 19, bce, herod, the, great, further, expanded, the, temple, mount, and, rebuilt, the, temple, the, ambitious, project, which, involved, the, employment, of, 10, 000, workers, more, than, doubled, the, size, of, the, temple, mount, to, approximately, 36, acres, 150, 000, m, 2, herod, leveled, the, area, by, cutting, away, rock, on, the, northwest, side, and, raising, the, sloping, ground, to, the, south, he, achieved, this, by, constructing, huge, buttress, walls, and, vaults, and, filling, the, necessary, sections, with, earth, and, rubble, the, result, was, the, largest, temenos, in, the, ancient, world, the, main, entrances, to, the, herodian, temple, mount, were, two, sets, of, gates, built, into, the, southern, wall, together, with, four, other, gates, reachable, from, the, western, side, by, stairs, and, bridges, grand, stoas, encircled, the, platform, on, three, sides, and, on, its, southern, side, stood, a, magnificent, basilica, josephus, referred, to, as, the, royal, stoa, the, royal, stoa, served, as, a, center, for, the, city, s,

construction, of, the, new, city, as, a, gift, to, the, jews, but, since, he, had, constructed, a, giant, statue, of, himself, in, front, of, the, temple, of, jupiter, and, the, temple, of, jupiter, had, a, huge, statue, of, jupiter, inside, it, there, were, on, the, temple, mount, now, two, enormous, graven, images, which, jews, considered, idolatrous, it, was, also, customary, in, roman, rites,

garments, and, then, depart, the, occasion, is, assumed, to, have, been, tisha, b, av, since, decades, later, jerome, related, that, that, was, the, only, day, on, which, jews, were, permitted, to, enter, jerusalem, constantine, s, nephew, emperor, julian, granted, permission, in, the, year, 363, for, the, jews, to, rebuild, the, temple, in, a, letter, attributed, to, julian, he, wrote, to, the, jews, that, this, you, ought, to, do, in, order, that, when, i, have, successfully, concluded, the, war, in, persia, i, may, rebuild, by, my, own, efforts, the, sacred, city, of, jerusalem, which, for, so, many, years, you, have, longed, to, see, inhabited, and, may, bring, settlers, there, and, together, with, you, may, glorify, the, most, high, god, therein, julian, saw, the, jewish, god, as, a, fitting, member, of, the, pantheon, of, gods, he, believed, in, and, he, was, also, a, strong, opponent, of, christianity, church, historians, wrote, that, the, jews, began, to, clear, away, the, structures, and, rubble, on, the, temple, mount, but, were, thwarted, first, by, a, great, earthquake, and, then, by, miracles, that, included, fire, springing, from, the, earth, however, no, contemporary, jewish, sources, mention, this, episode, directly, during, his, excavations, in, the, 1930s, robert, hamilton, uncovered, portions, of, a, multicolor, mosaic, floor, with, geometric, patterns, inside, al, aqsa, mosque, but, did, not, publish, them, the, date, of, the, mosaic, is, disputed, zachi, dvira, considers, that, they, are, from, the, pre, islamic, byzantine, period, while, baruch, reich, and, sandhaus, favor, a, much, later, umayyad, origin, on, account, of, their, similarity, to, a, known, umayyad, mosaic, in, 610, the, sassanid, empire, drove, the, byzantine, empire, out, of, the, middle, east, giving, the, jews, control, of, jerusalem, for, the, first, time, in, centuries, the, jews, in, palestine, were, allowed, to, set, up, a, vassal, state, under, the, sassanid, empire, called, the, sassanid, jewish, commonwealth, which, lasted, for, five, years, jewish, rabbis, ordered, the, restart, of, animal, sacrifice, for, the, first, time, since, the, time, of, second, temple, and, started, to, reconstruct, the, jewish, temple, shortly, before, the, byzantines, took, the, area, back, five, years, later, in, 615, the, persians, gave, control, to, the, christian, population, who, tore, down, the, partially, built, jewish, temple, edifice, and, turned, it, into, a, garbage, dump, which, is, what, it, was, when, the, rashidun, caliph, umar, took, the, city, in, 637, in, 637, arabs, besieged, and, captured, the, city, from, the, byzantine, empire, which, had, defeated, the, persian, forces, and, their, allies, and, reconquered, the, city, there, are, no, contemporary, records, but, many, traditions, about, the, origin, of, the, main, islamic, buildings, on, the, mount, a, popular, account, from, later, centuries, is, that, the, rashidun, caliph, umar, was, led, to, the, place, reluctantly, by, the, christian, patriarch, sophronius, he, found, it, covered, with, rubbish, but, the, sacred, rock, was, found, with, the, help, of, a, converted, jew, ka, b, al, ahbar, al, ahbar, advised, umar, to, build, a, mosque, to, the, north, of, the, rock, so, that, worshippers, would, face, both, the, rock, and, mecca, but, instead, umar, chose, to, build, it, to, the, south, of, the, rock, it, became, known, as, al, aqsa, mosque, according, to, muslim, sources, jews, participated, in, the, construction, of, the, haram, laying, the, groundwork, for, both, al, aqsa, and, the, dome, of, the, rock, mosques, the, first, known, eyewitness, testimony, is, that, of, the, pilgrim, arculf, who, visited, about, 670, according, to, arculf, s, account, as, recorded, by, adomn, n, he, saw, a, rectangular, wooden, house, of, prayer, built, over, some, ruins, large, enough, to, hold, 3, 000, people, in, 691, an, octagonal, islamic, building, topped, by, a, dome, was, built, by, the, caliph, abd, al, malik, around, the, rock, for, a, myriad, of, political, dynastic, and, religious, reasons, built, on, local, and, quranic, traditions, articulating, the, site, s, holiness, a, process, in, which, textual, and, architectural, narratives, reinforced, one, another, the, shrine, became, known, as, the, dome, of, the, rock, qubbat, as, sakhra, the, dome, itself, was, covered, in, gold, in, 1920, in, 715, the, umayyads, led, by, the, caliph, al, walid, i, built, al, aqsa, mosque, al, masjid, al, aq, lit, furthest, mosque, corresponding, to, the, islamic, belief, of, muhammad, s, miraculous, nocturnal, journey, as, recounted, in, the, quran, and, hadith, the, term, noble, sanctuary, or, haram, al, sharif, as, it, was, called, later, by, the, mamluks, and, ottomans, refers, to, the, entirer, area, that, surrounds, that, rock, the, crusader, period, began, in, 1099, with, the, first, crusade, s, capture, of, jerusalem, after, the, city, s, conquest, the, crusading, order, known, as, the, knights, templar, was, granted, use, of, al, aqsa, mosque, to, use, as, their, headquarters, this, was, probably, by, baldwin, ii, of, jerusalem, and, warmund, patriarch, of, jerusalem, at, the, council, of, nablus, in, january, 1120, the, temple, mount, had, a, mystique, because, it, was, above, what, were, believed, to, be, the, ruins, of, the, temple, of, solomon, the, crusaders, therefore, referred, to, al, aqsa, mosque, as, solomon, s, temple, and, it, was, from, this, location, that, the, new, order, took, the, name, of, poor, knights, of, christ, and, the, temple, of, solomon, or, templar, knights, in, 1187, once, he, retook, jerusalem, saladin, removed, all, traces, of, christian, worship, from, the, temple, mount, returning, the, dome, of, the, rock, and, al, aqsa, mosque, to, their, muslim, purposes, it, remained, in, muslim, hands, thereafter, even, during, the, relatively, short, periods, of, crusader, rule, following, the, sixth, crusade, there, are, several, mamluk, buildings, on, and, around, the, haram, esplanade, such, as, the, late, 15th, century, al, ashrafiyya, madrasa, and, sabil, fountain, of, qaytbay, the, mamluks, also, raised, the, level, of, jerusalem, s, central, or, tyropoean, valley, bordering, the, temple, mount, from, the, west, by, constructing, huge, substructures, on, which, they, then, built, on, a, large, scale, the, mamluk, period, substructures, and, over, ground, buildings, are, thus, covering, much, of, the, herodian, western, wall, of, the, temple, mount, following, the, ottoman, conquest, of, palestine, in, 1516, the, ottoman, authorities, continued, the, policy, of, prohibiting, non, muslims, from, setting, foot, on, the, temple, mount, until, the, early, 19th, century, when, non, muslims, were, again, permitted, to, visit, the, site, in, 1867, a, team, from, the, royal, engineers, led, by, lieutenant, charles, warren,

days, after, the, six, day, war, on, june, 17, 1967, a, meeting, was, held, at, the, al, aqsa, mosque, between, moshe, dayan, and, muslim, religious, authorities, of, jerusalem, reformulating, the, status, quo, jews, were, given, the, right, to, visit, the, temple, mount, unobstructed, and, free, of, charge, if, they, respected, muslims, religious, feelings, and, acted, decently, but, they, were, not, allowed, to, pray, the, western, wall, was, to, remain, the, jewish, place, of, prayer, religious, sovereignty, was, to, remain, with, the, muslims, while, overall, sovereignty, became, israeli, the, muslims, objected, to, dayan, s, offer, as, they, completely, rejected, the, israeli, conquest, of, jerusalem, and, the, temple, mount, some, jews, led, by, shlomo, goren, then, the, military, chief, rabbi, had, objected, as, well, claiming, the, decision, handed, over, the, complex, to, the, muslims, since, the, western, wall, s, holiness, is, derived, from, the, mount, and, symbolizes, exile, while, praying, on, the, mount, symbolizes, freedom, and, the, return, of, the, jewish, people, to, their, homeland, the, president, of, the, high, court, of, justice, aharon, barak, in, response, to, an, appeal, in, 1976, against, police, interference, with, an, individual, s, putative, right, to, prayer, on, the, site, expressed, the, view, that, while, jews, had, a, right, to, prayer, there, it, was, not, absolute, but, subject, to, the, public, interest, and, the, rights, of, other, groups, israel, s, courts, have, considered, the, issue, as, one, beyond, their, remit, and, given, the, delicacy, of, the, matter, under, political, jurisdiction, barak, wrote, the, basic, principle, is, that, every, jew, has, the, right, to, enter, the, temple, mount, to, pray, there, and, to, have, communion, with, his, maker, this, is, part, of, the, religious, freedom, of, worship, it, is, part, of, the, freedom, of, expression, however, as, with, every, human, right, it, is, not, absolute, but, a, relative, right, indeed, in, a, case, where, there, is, near, certainty, that, injury, may, be, caused, to, the, public, interest, if, a, person, s, rights, of, religious, worship, and, freedom, of, expression, would, be, realized, it, is, possible, to, limit, the, rights, of, the, person, in, order, to, uphold, the, public, interest, police, continued, to, forbid, jews, to, pray, on, the, temple, mount, subsequently, several, prime, ministers, also, made, attempts, to, change, the, status, quo, but, failed, in, october, 1986, an, agreement, between, the, temple, mount, faithful, the, supreme, muslim, council, and, police, which, would, allow, short, visits, in, small, groups, was, exercised, once, and, never, repeated, after, 2, 000, muslims, armed, with, stones, and, bottles, attacked, the, group, and, stoned, worshipers, at, the, western, wall, during, the, 1990s, additional, attempts, were, made, for, jewish, prayer, on, the, temple, mount, which, were, stopped, by, israeli, police, until, 2000, non, muslim, visitors, could, enter, the, dome, of, the, rock, al, aqsa, mosque, and, the, islamic, museum, by, getting, a, ticket, from, the, waqf, this, procedure, ended, when, the, second, intifada, erupted, fifteen, years, later, negotiation, between, israel, and, jordan, might, result, in, reopening, of, those, sites, once, again, in, the, 2010s, fear, arose, among, palestinians, that, israel, planned, to, change, the, status, quo, and, permit, jewish, prayers, or, that, al, aqsa, mosque, might, be, damaged, or, destroyed, by, israel, al, aqsa, was, used, as, a, base, for, attacks, on, visitors, and, the, police, from, which, stones, firebombs, and, fireworks, were, thrown, the, israeli, police, had, never, entered, al, aqsa, mosque, until, november, 5, 2014, when, dialog, with, the, leaders, of, the, waqf, and, the, rioters, failed, this, resulted, in, imposing, strict, limitations, on, entry, of, visitors, to, the, temple, mount, israeli, leadership, repeatedly, stated, that, the, status, quo, would, not, change, according, to, then, jerusalem, police, commissioner, yohanan, danino, the, place, is, at, the, center, of, a, holy, war, and, anyone, who, wants, to, change, the, status, quo, on, the, temple, mount, should, not, be, allowed, up, there, citing, an, extreme, right, wing, agenda, to, change, the, status, quo, on, the, temple, mount, hamas, and, islamic, jihad, continued, to, erroneously, assert, that, the, israeli, government, planned, to, destroy, the, al, aqsa, mosque, resulting, in, chronic, terrorist, attacks, and, rioting, there, have, been, several, changes, to, the, status, quo, many, palestinians, believe, the, status, quo, is, threatened, since, right, wing, israelis, have, been, challenging, it, with, more, force, and, frequency, asserting, a, religious, right, to, pray, there, until, israel, banned, them, members, of, murabitat, a, group, of, women, cried, allah, akbar, at, groups, of, jewish, visitors, to, remind, them, the, temple, mount, was, still, in, muslim, hands, in, october, 2021, a, jewish, man, aryeh, lippo, who, was, banned, by, israeli, police, from, the, temple, mount, for, fifteen, days, after, being, caught, quietly, praying, had, his, ban, overturned, by, an, israeli, court, on, the, grounds, that, his, behavior, had, not, violated, police, instructions, hamas, called, the, ruling, a, clear, declaration, of, war, a, higher, israel, court, quickly, reversed, the, lower, court, s, ruling, an, islamic, waqf, has, managed, the, temple, mount, continuously, since, the, muslim, reconquest, of, the, latin, kingdom, of, jerusalem, in, 1187, on, june, 7, 1967, soon, after, israel, had, taken, control, of, the, area, during, the, six, day, war, prime, minister, levi, eshkol, assured, that, no, harm, whatsoever, shall, come, to, the, places, sacred, to, all, religions, together, with, the, extension, of, israeli, jurisdiction, and, administration, over, east, jerusalem, the, knesset, passed, the, preservation, of, the, holy, places, law, ensuring, protection, of, the, holy, places, against, desecration, as, well, as,

muslims, who, are, observed, praying, on, the, site, are, subject, to, expulsion, by, the, police, at, various, times, when, there, is, fear, of, arab, rioting, upon, the, mount, resulting, in, throwing, stones, from, above, towards, the, western, wall, plaza, israel, has, prevented, muslim, men, under, 45, from, praying, in, the, compound, citing, these, concerns, sometimes, such, restrictions, have, coincided, with, friday, prayers, during, the, islamic, holy, month, of, ramadan, normally, west, bank, palestinians, are, allowed, access, to, jerusalem, only, during, islamic, holidays, with, access, usually, restricted, to, men, over, 35, and, women, of, any, age, eligible, for, permits, to, enter, the, city, palestinian, residents, of, jerusalem, which, because, of, israel, s, annexation, of, jerusalem, hold, israeli, permanent, residency, cards, and, israeli, arabs, are, permitted, unrestricted, access, to, the, temple, mount, the, mughrabi, gate, is, the, only,

wall, a, retaining, wall, for, the, temple, mount, and, remnant, of, the, second, temple, structure, is, considered, by, some, rabbinical, authorities, to, be, the, holiest, accessible, site, for, jews, to, pray, a, 2013, knesset, committee, hearing, considered, allowing, jews, to, pray, at, the, site, amidst, heated, debate, arab, israeli, mps, were, ejected, for, disrupting, the, hearing, after, shouting, at, the, chairman, calling, her, a, pyromaniac, religious, affairs, minister, eli, ben, dahan, of, jewish, home, said, his, ministry, was, seeking, legal, ways, to, enable, jews, to, pray, at, the, site, during, temple, times, entry, to, the, mount, was, limited, by, a, complex, set, of, purity, laws, persons, suffering, from, corpse, uncleanness, were, not, allowed, to, enter, the, inner, court, non, jews, were, also, prohibited, from, entering, the, inner, court, of, the, temple, a, hewn, stone, measuring, 60, cm, 90, cm, 24, in, 35, in, and, engraved, with, greek, uncials, was, discovered, in, 1871, near, a, court, on, the, temple, mount, in, jerusalem, in, which, it, outlined, this, prohibition, translation, let, no, foreigner, enter, within, the, parapet, and, the, partition, which, surrounds, the, temple, precincts, anyone, caught, will, be, held, accountable, for, his, ensuing, death, today, the, stone, is, preserved, in, istanbul, s, museum, of, antiquities, maimonides, wrote, that, it, was, only, permitted, to, enter, the, site, to, fulfill, a, religious, precept, after, the, destruction, of, the, temple, there, was, discussion, as, to, whether, the, site, bereft, of, the, temple, still, maintained, its, holiness, jewish, codifiers, accepted, the, opinion, of, maimonides, who, ruled, that, the, holiness, of, the, temple, sanctified, the, site, for, eternity, and, consequently, the, restrictions, on, entry, to, the, site, remain, in, force, while, secular, jews, ascend, freely, the, question, of, whether, ascending, is, permitted, is, a, matter, of, some, debate, among, religious, authorities, with, a, majority, holding, that, it, is, permitted, to, ascend, to, the, temple, mount, but, not, to, step, on, the, site, of, the, inner, courtyards, of, the, ancient, temple, the, question, then, becomes, whether, the, site, can, be, ascertained, accurately, there, is, debate, over, whether, reports, that, maimonides, himself, ascended, the, mount, are, reliable, one, such, report, claims, that, he, did, so, on, thursday, october, 21, 1165, during, the, crusader, period, some, early, scholars, however, claim, that, entry, onto, certain, areas, of, the, mount, is, permitted, it, appears, that, radbaz, also, entered, the, mount, and, advised, others, how, to, do, this, he, permits, entry, from, all, the, gates, into, the, 135, x, 135, cubits, of, the, women, s, courtyard, in, the, east, since, the, biblical, prohibition, only, applies, to, the, 187, x, 135, cubits, of, the, temple, in, the, west, there, are, also, christian, and, islamic, sources, which, indicate, that, jews, visited, the, site, but, these, visits, may, have, been, made, under, duress, a, few, hours, after, the, temple, mount, came, under, israeli, control, during, the, six, day, war, a, message, from, the, chief, rabbis, of, israel, isser, yehuda, unterman, and, yitzhak, nissim, was, broadcast, warning, that, jews, were, not, permitted, to, enter, the, site, this, warning, was, reiterated, by, the, council, of, the, chief, rabbinate, a, few, days, later, which, issued, an, explanation, written, by, rabbi, bezalel, jolti, zolti, that, since, the, sanctity, of, the, site, has, never, ended, it, is, forbidden, to, enter, the, temple, mount, until, the, temple, is, built, the, signatures, of, more, than, 300, prominent, rabbis, were, later, obtained, a, major, critic, of, the, decision, of, the, chief, rabbinate, was, rabbi, shlomo, goren, the, chief, rabbi, of, the, idf, according, to, general, uzi, narkiss, who, led, the, israeli, force, that, conquered, the, temple, mount, goren, proposed, to, him, that, the, dome, of, the, rock, be, immediately, blown, up, after, narkiss, refused, goren, unsuccessfully, petitioned, the, government, to, close, off, the, mount, to, jews, and, non, jews, alike, later, he, established, his, office, on, the, mount, and, conducted, a, series, of, demonstrations, on, the, mount, in, support, of, the, right, of, jewish, men, to, enter, there, his, behavior, displeased, the, government, which, restricted, his, public, actions, censored, his, writings, and, in, august, prevented, him, from, attending, the, annual, oral, law, conference, at, which, the, question, of, access, to, the, mount, was, debated, although, there, was, considerable, opposition, the, conference, consensus, was, to, confirm, the, ban, on, entry, to, jews, the, ruling, said, we, have, been, warned, since, time, immemorial, against, entering, the, entire, area, of, the, temple, mount, and, have, indeed, avoided, doing, so, according, to, ron, hassner, the, ruling, brilliantly, solved, the, government, s, problem, of, avoiding, ethnic, conflict, since, those, jews, who, most, respected, rabbinical, authority, were, those, most, likely, to, clash, with, muslims, on, the, mount, rabbinical, consensus, in, the, post, 1967, period, held, that, it, is, forbidden, for, jews, to, enter, any, part, of, the, temple, mount, and, in, january, 2005, a, declaration, was, signed, confirming, the, 1967, decision, most, haredi, rabbis, are, of, the, opinion, that, the, mount, is, off, limits, to, jews, and, non, jews, alike, their, opinions, against, entering, the, temple, mount, are, based, on, the, current, political, climate, surrounding, the, mount, along, with, the, potential, danger, of, entering, the, hallowed, area, of, the, temple, courtyard, and, the, impossibility, of, fulfilling, the, ritual, requirement, of, cleansing, oneself, with, the, ashes, of, a, red, heifer, the, boundaries, of, the, areas, which, are, completely, forbidden, while, having, large, portions, in, common, are, delineated, differently, by, various, rabbinic, authorities, however, there, is, a, growing, body, of, modern, orthodox, and, national, religious, rabbis, who, encourage, visits, to, certain, parts, of, the, mount, which, they, believe, are, permitted, according, to, most, medieval, rabbinical, authorities, these, rabbis, include, shlomo, goren, former, ashkenazi, chief, rabbi, of, israel, chaim, david, halevi, former, chief, rabbi, of, tel, aviv, and, yafo, dov, lior, rabbi, of, kiryat, arba, yosef, elboim, yisrael, ariel, she, ar, yashuv, cohen, chief, rabbi, of, haifa, yuval, sherlo, rosh, yeshiva, of, the, hesder, yeshiva, of, petah, tikva, meir, kahane, one, of, them, shlomo, goren, held, that, it, is, possible, that, jews, are, even, allowed, to, enter, the, heart, of, the, dome, of, the, rock, in, time, of, war, according, to, jewish, law, of, conquest, these, authorities, demand, an, attitude, of, veneration, on, the, part, of, jews, ascending, the, temple, mount, ablution, in, a, mikveh, prior, to, the, ascent, and, the, wearing, of, non, leather, shoes, some, rabbinic, authorities, are, now, of, the, opinion, that, it, is, imperative, for, jews, to, ascend, in, order, to, halt, the, ongoing, process, of, islamization, of, the, temple, mount, maimonides, perhaps, the, greatest, codifier, of, jewish, law, wrote, in, laws, of, the, chosen, house, ch, 7, law, 15, one, may, bring, a, dead, body, in, to, the, lower, sanctified, areas, of, the, temple, mount, and, there, is, no, need, to, say, that, the, ritually, impure, from, the, dead, may, enter, there, because, the, dead, body, itself, can, enter, one, who, is, ritually, impure, through, direct, or, in, direct, contact, of, the, dead, cannot, walk, in, the, higher, sanctified, areas, for, those, who, are, visibly, jewish, they, have, no, choice, but, to, follow, a, peripheral, route, as, it, has, become, unofficially, part, of, the, status, quo, on, the, mount, many, of, these, recent, opinions, rely, on, archaeological, evidence, in, december, 2013, the, two, chief, rabbis, of, israel, david, lau, and, yitzhak, yosef, reiterated, the, ban, on, jews, entering, the, temple, mount, they, wrote, in, light, of, neglecting, we, once, again, warn, that, nothing, has, changed, and, this, strict, prohibition, remains, in, effect, for, the, entire, area, in, november, 2014, the, sephardic, chief, rabbi, yitzhak, yosef, reiterated, the, point, of, view, held, by, many, rabbinic, authorities, that, jews, should, not, visit, the, mount, on, the, occasion, of, an, upsurge, in, palestinian, knifing, attacks, on, israelis, associated, with, fears, that, israel, was, changing, the, status, quo, on, the, mount, the, haredi, newspaper, mishpacha, ran, a, notification, in, arabic, asking, their, cousins, palestinians, to, stop, trying, to, murder, members, of, their, congregation, since, they, were, vehemently, opposed, to, ascending, the, mount, and, consider, such, visits, proscribed, by, jewish, law, the, large, courtyard, sahn, can, host, more, than, 400, 000, worshippers, making, it, one, of, the, largest, mosques, in, the, world, the, upper, platform, surrounds, the, dome, of, the, rock, beneath, which, lies, the, well, of, souls, originally, accessible, only, by, a, narrow, hole, in, the, sakhrah, the, foundation, stone, on, which, the, dome, of, the, rock, site, and, after, which, it, is, named, until, the, crusaders, dug, a, new, entrance, to, the, cave, from, the, south, the, platform, is, accessible, via, eight, staircases, each, of, which, is, topped, by, a, free, standing, arcade, known, in, arabic, as, the, qanatir, or, mawazin, the, arcades, were, erected, in, different, periods, from, the, 10th, to, 15th, centuries, there, is, also, a, smaller, domed, building, on, the, upper, platform, to, the, east, of, the, dome, of, the, rock, known, as, the, dome, of, the, chain, qubbat, al, sisila, in, arabic, its, exact, origin, and, purpose, is, uncertain, but, historical, sources, indicate, it, was, built, under, the, reign, of, abd, al, malik, the, same, umayyad, caliph, who, built, the, dome, of, the, rock, two, other, small, domes, stand, to, the, northwest, of, the, dome, of, the, rock, the, dome, of, the, ascension, qubbat, al, miraj, in, arabic, has, an, inscription, with, a, date, corresponding, to, 1201, ce, it, may, have, been, a, former, crusader, structure, possibly, a, baptistery, that, was, repurposed, at, this, time, or, it, may, be, a, structure, that, was, built, after, saladin, s, capture, of, the, city, and, reused, some, crusader, era, materials, including, its, columns, per, its, name, this, dome, commemorates, the, spot, where, according, to, some, muhammad, ascended, to, heaven, the, dome, of, the, spirits, or, dome, of, the, winds, qubbat, al, arwah, in, arabic, stands, a, little, further, north, and, is, dated, to, the, 16th, century, in, the, southwest, corner, of, the, upper, platform, is, a, quadrangular, structure, which, includes, a, portion, topped, by, another, dome, it, is, known, as, the, dome, of, literature, qubba, nahwiyya, in, arabic, and, dated, to, 1208, standing, further, east, close, to, one, of, the, southern, entrance, arcades, is, a, stone, minbar, known, as, the, summer, pulpit, or, minbar, of, burhan, al, din, used, for, open, air, prayers, it, appears, to, be, an, older, ciborium, from, the, crusader, period, as, attested, by, its, sculptural, decoration, which, was, then, reused, under, the, ayyubids, sometime, after, 1345, a, mamluk, judge, named, burhan, al, din, d, 1388, restored, it, and, added, a, stone, staircase, giving, it, its, present, form, the, lower, platform, which, constitutes, most, of, the, surface, of, the, temple, mount, has, at, its, southern, end, al, aqsa, mosque, which, takes, up, most, of, the, width, of, the, mount, gardens, take, up, the, eastern, and, most, of, the, northern, side, of, the, platform, the, far, north, of, the, platform, houses, an, islamic, school, the, lower, platform, also, houses, an, ablution, fountain, known, as, al, kas, originally, supplied, with, water, via, a, long, narrow, aqueduct, leading, from, the, so, called, solomon, s, pools, near, bethlehem, but, now, supplied, from, jerusalem, s, water, mains, there, are, several, cisterns, beneath, the, lower, platform, designed, to, collect, rainwater, as, a, water, supply, these, have, various, forms, and, structures, seemingly, built, in, different, periods, ranging, from, vaulted, chambers, built, in, the, gap, between, the, bedrock, and, the, platform, to, chambers, cut, into, the, bedrock, itself, of, these, the, most, notable, are, numbering, traditionally, follows, wilson, s, scheme, the, retaining, walls, of, the, platform, contain, several, gateways, all, now, blocked, in, the, eastern, wall, is, the, golden, gate, through, which, legend, states, the, jewish, messiah, would, enter, jerusalem, on, the, southern, face, are, the, hulda, gates, the, triple, gate, which, has, three, arches, and, the, double, gate, which, has, two, arches, and, is, partly, obscured, by, a, crusader, building, these, were, the, entrance, and, exit, respectively, to, the, temple, mount, from, ophel, the, oldest, part, of, jerusalem, and, the, main, access, to, the, mount, for, ordinary, jews, in, the, western, face, near, the, southern, corner, is, the, barclay, s, gate, only, half, visible, due, to, a, building, the, house, of, abu, sa, ud, on, the, northern, side, also, in, the, western, face, hidden, by, later, construction, but, visible, via, the, recent, western, wall, tunnels, and, only, rediscovered, by, warren, is, warren, s, gate, the, function, of, these, western, gates, is, obscure, but, many, jews, view, warren, s, gate, as, particularly, holy, due, to, its, location, due, west, of, the, dome, of, the, rock, the, current, location, of, the, dome, of, the, rock, is, considered, one, of, the, possible, locations, where, the, holy, of, holies, was, placed, numerous, alternative, opinions, exist, based, on, study, and, calculations, such, as, those, of, tuvia, sagiv, warren, was, able, to, investigate, the, inside, of, these, gates, warren, s, gate, and, the, golden, gate, simply, head, toward, the, centre, of, the, mount, giving, access, to, the, surface, by, steps, barclay, s, gate, is, similar, but, abruptly, turns, south, as, it, does, so, the, reason, for, this, is, unknown, the, double, and, triple, gates, the, huldah, gates, are, more, substantial, heading, into, the, mount, for, some, distance, they, each, finally, have, steps, rising, to, the, surface, just, north, of, al, aqsa, mosque, the, passageway, for, each, is, vaulted, and, has, two, aisles, in, the, case, of, the, triple, gate, a, third, aisle, exists, for, a, brief, distance, beyond, the, gate, the, eastern, aisle, of, the, double, gates, and, western, aisle, of, the, triple, gates, reach, the, surface, the, other, aisles, terminating, some, way, before, the, steps, warren, believed, that, one, aisle, of, each, original, passage, was, extended, when, al, aqsa, mosque, blocked, the, original, surface, exits, in, the, process, of, investigating, cistern, 10, warren, discovered, tunnels, that, lay, under, the, triple, gate, passageway, these, passages, lead, in, erratic, directions, some, leading, beyond, the, southern, edge, of, the, temple, mount, they, are, at, a, depth, below, the, base, of, the, walls, their, purpose, is, unknown, as, is, whether, they, predate, the, temple, mount, a, situation, not, helped, by, the, fact, that, apart, from, warren, s, expedition, no, one, else, is, known, to, have, visited, them, altogether, there, are, six, major, sealed, gates, and, a, postern, listed, here, counterclockwise, dating, from, either, the, roman, herodian, byzantine, or, early, muslim, periods, there, are, now, eleven, open, gates, offering, access, to, the, muslim, haram, al, sharif, two, twin, gates, follow, south, of, the, ablution, gate, the, tranquility, gate, and, the, gate, of, the, chain, a, twelfth, gate, still, open, during, ottoman, rule, is, now, closed, to, the, public, east, of, and, joined, to, the, triple, gate, passageway, is, a, large, vaulted, area, supporting, the, southeastern, corner, of, the, temple, mount, platform, which, is, substantially, above, the, bedrock, at, this, point, the, vaulted, chambers, here, are, popularly, referred, to, as, solomon, s, stables, they, were, used, as, stables, by, the, crusaders, but, were, built, by, herod, the, great, along, with, the, platform, they, were, built, to, support, the, complex, is, bordered, on, the, south, and, east, by, the, outer, walls, of, the, old, city, of, jerusalem, on, the, north, and, west, it, is, bordered, by, two, long, porticos, riwaq, built, during, the, mamluk, period, a, number, of, other, structures, were, also, built, along, these, areas, mainly, also, from, the, mamluk, period, on, the, north, side, they, include, the, isardiyya, madrasa, built, before, 1345, and, the, almalikiyya, madrasa, dated, to, 1340, on, the, west, side, they, include, the, ashrafiyya, madrasa, built, by, sultan, qaytbay, between, 1480, and, 1482, and, the, adjacent, uthmaniyya, madrasa, dated, to, 1437, the, sabil, of, qaytbay, contemporary, with, the, ashrafiyya, madrasa, also, stands, nearby, the, existing, four, minarets, include, three, along, the, western, perimeter, of, the, esplanade, and, one, along, the, northern, wall, the, earliest, dated, minaret, was, constructed, on, the, northwest, corner, of, the, temple, mount, in, 1298, with, three, other, minarets, added, over, the, course, of, the, 14th, century, due, to, the, extreme, political, sensitivity, of, the, site, no, real, archaeological, excavations, have, ever, been, conducted, on, the, temple, mount, itself, protests, commonly, occur, whenever, archaeologists, conduct, projects, near, the, mount, this, sensitivity, has, not, however, protected, both, jewish, and, muslim, works, from, accusations, of, destroying, archeological, evidence, on, a, number, of, occasions, aside, from, visual, observation, of, surface, features, most, other, archaeological, knowledge, of, the, site, comes, from, the, 19th, century, survey, carried, out, by, charles, wilson, and, charles, warren, and, others, since, the, waqf, is, granted, almost, full, autonomy, on, the, islamic, holy, sites, israeli, archaeologists, have, been, prevented, from, inspecting, the, area, and, are, restricted, to, conducting, excavations, around, the, temple, mount, after, the, six, day, war, of, 1967, israeli, archeologists, began, a, series, of, excavations, near, the, site, at, the, southern, wall, that, uncovered, finds, from, the, second, temple, period, through, roman, umayyad, and, crusader, times, israeli, archaeological, digs, at, the, southwestern, corner, of, temple, mount, discovered, traces, of, four, muslim, palaces, built, under, the, umayyad, caliphate, though, the, remains, have, not, been, well, preserved, but, instead, had, a, museum, built, upon, them, the, former, un, envoy, to, jerusalem, raymond, m, lemaire, criticised, the, construction, of, a, metallic, pergola, in, the, middle, of, the, courtyard, of, one, of, the, umayyad, palaces, which, disfigures, the, site, upon, visiting, jerusalem, in, september, 1999, medieval, art, historian, l, on, pressouyre, noted, that, the, palaces, had, lost, their, archaeological, features, due, to, neglect, for, in, the, guise, of, highlighting, the, remains, of, previous, periods, trivialise, the, umayyad, palaces, major, monuments, in, the, area, over, the, period, 1970, 1988, a, number, of, tunnels, were, excavated, in, the, vicinity, including, one, that, passed, to, the, west, of, the, mount, and, became, known, as, the, western, wall, tunnel, which, was, opened, to, the, public, in, 1996, the, same, year, the, waqf, began, construction, of, a, new, mosque, in, the, structures, known, since, crusader, times, as, solomon, s, stables, many, israelis, regarded, this, as, a, radical, change, of, the, status, quo, which, should, not, have, been, undertaken, without, first, consulting, the, israeli, government, the, project, was, done, without, attention, to, the, possibility, of, disturbing, historically, significant, archaeological, material, with, stone, and, ancient, artifacts, treated, without, regard, to, their, preservation, israeli, organizations, such, as, the, committee, to, prevent, the, destruction, of, antiquities, on, the, temple, mount, argue, that, palestinians, are, deliberately, removing, significant, amounts, of, archaeological, evidence, about, the, jewish, past, of, the, site, and, claim, to, have, found, significant, artifacts, in, the, fill, removed, by, bulldozers, and, trucks, from, the, temple, mount, since, the, late, 1990s, the, temple, mount, sifting, project, has, been, reclaiming, earth, from, similar,
