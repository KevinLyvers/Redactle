seen, but, the, prince, asks, him, to, let, her, try, on, the, slipper, aschenputtel, appears, after, washing, clean, her, face, and, hands, and, when, she, puts, on, the, slipper, which, fitted, her, like, a, glove, the, prince, recognizes, her, as, the, stranger, with, whom, he, has, danced, at, the, festival, even, before, trying, it, to, the, horror, of, the, stepmother, and, the, two, limping, sisters, their, merely, servant, girl, had, won, without, any, subterfuge, the, prince, put, aschenputtel, before, him, on, his, horse, and, rode, off, to, the, palace, while, passing, the, hazel,

coda, added, in, the, second, edition, of, 1819, during, aschenputtel, s, royal, wedding, the, false, stepsisters, had, hoped, to, worm, their, way, into, her, favour, as, the, future, queen, as, she,

awful, comeuppance, they, have, to, endure, in, addition, to, the, absence, of, the, punishment, of, the, stepsisters, there, are, other, minor, differences, in, the, first, edition, of, 1812, some, of, which, are, reminiscent, of, perrault, s, version, in, the, first, edition, cinderella, s, mother, herself, tells, her, to, plant, a, tree, on, her, grave, no, bird, perches, on, the, tree, but, the, tree, itself, gives, the, girl, what, she, wants, the, birds, appear, only, when, they, help, cinderella, collect, lentils, a, task, that, is, assigned, to, her, by, her, stepsisters, rather, than, her, stepmother, and, they, are, not, a, flock, but, just, two, pigeons, on, the, evening, of, the, first, ball, cinderella, does, not, participate, but, she, watches, her, stepsisters, dance, with, the, prince, from, the, pigeon, coop, later, cinderella, tells, the, sisters, she, saw, them, dancing, and, they, destroy, the, pigeon, coop, out, of, jealousy, in, the, 1812, version, the, tree, also, gives, cinderella, a, carriage, with, six, horses, to, go, to, the, ball, and, the, pigeons, tell, her, to, return, before, midnight, the, episodes, in, which, cinderella, hides, in, the, pigeon, coop, and, on, the, pear, tree, were, added, in, the, 1819, version, furthermore, not, knowing, cinderella, s, home, the, prince, makes, other, girls, in, the, kingdom, try, on, the, slipper,

studies, have, continued, on, this, seminal, work, joseph, jacobs, has, attempted, to, reconstruct, the, original, tale, as, the, cinder, maid, by, comparing, the, common, features, among, hundreds, of, variants, collected, across, europe, the, aarne, thompson, uther, system, classifies, cinderella, as, type, 510a, persecuted, heroine, others, of, this, type, include, the, sharp, grey, sheep,

versions, the, helper, is, an, animal, such, as, a, cow, a, bull, a, pike, or, a, saint, or, angel, the, bovine, helper, appears, in, some, greek, versions, in, the, balkan, slavonic, tradition, of, the, tale, and, in, some, central, asian, variants, the, mother, as, cow, is, killed, by, the, heroine, s, sisters, her, bones, gathered, and, from, her, grave, the, heroine, gets, the, wonderful, dresses, africanist, sigrid, schmidt, stated, that, a, typical, scene, in, kapmalaien, cape, malays, tales, is, the, mother, becoming, a, fish, being, eaten, in, fish, form, the, daughter, burying, her, bones, and, a, tree, sprouting, from, her, grave, professor, gra, ina, skabeikyt, kazlauskien, recognizes, that, the, fish, the, cow, even, a, female, dog, in, other, variants, these, animals, represent, the, mother, s, legacy, jack, zipes, commenting, on, a, sicilian, variant, concluded, much, the, same, cinderella, is, helped, by, her, mother, in, the, guise, of, doves, fairies, and, godmothers, in, his, notes, to, his, own, reconstruction, joseph, jacobs, acknowledged, that, the, heroine, s, animal, helper, e, g, cow, or, sheep, was, clearly, identified, with, her, mother, as, well, as, the, tree, on, cinderella, s, mother, s, grave, was, connected, to, her, although, many, variants, of, cinderella, feature, the, wicked, stepmother, the, defining, trait, of, type, 510a, is, a, female, persecutor, in, fair, brown, and, trembling, and, finette, cendron, the, stepmother, does, not, appear, at, all, and, it, is, the, older, sisters, who, confine, her, to, the, kitchen, in, other, fairy, tales, featuring, the, ball, she, was, driven, from, home, by, the, persecutions, of, her, father, usually, because, he, wished, to, marry, her, of, this, type, 510b, are, cap, o,

she, likewise, finds, such, a, job, in, la, cenerentola, gioachino, rossini, inverted, the, sex, roles, cenerentola, is, mistreated, by, her, stepfather, this, makes, the, opera, aarne, thompson, type, 510b, he, also, made, the, economic, basis, for, such, hostility, unusually, clear, in, that, don, magnifico, wishes, to, make, his, own, daughters, dowries, larger, to, attract, a, grander, match, which, is, impossible, if, he, must, provide, a, third, dowry, folklorists, often, interpret, the, hostility, between, the, stepmother, and, stepdaughter, as, just, such, a, competition, for, resources, but, seldom, does, the, tale, make, it, clear, in, some, retellings, at, least, one, stepsister, is, somewhat, kind, to, cinderella, and, second, guesses, the, stepmother, s, treatment, this, is, seen, in, ever, after, the, two, direct, to, video, sequels, to, walt, disney, s, 1950, film, and, the, 2013, broadway, musical, the, number, of, balls, varies, sometimes, one, sometimes, two, and, sometimes, three, the, fairy, godmother, is, perrault, s, own, addition, to, the, tale, the, person, who, aided, cinderella, aschenputtel, in, the, grimms, s, version, is, her, dead, mother, aschenputtel, requests, her, aid, by, praying, at, her, grave, on, which, a, tree, is, growing, helpful, doves, roosting, in, the, tree, shake, down, the, clothing, she, needs, for, the, ball, this, motif, is, found, in, other, variants, of, the, tale, as, well, such, as, in, the, finnish, the, wonderful, birch, playwright, james, lapine, incorporated, this, motif, into, the, cinderella, plotline, of, the, musical, into, the, woods, giambattista, basile, s, la, gatta, cenerentola, combined, them, the, cinderella, figure, zezolla, asks, her, father, to, commend, her, to, the, dove, of,

pigeon, coop, to, elude, her, pursuers, her, father, tries, to, catch, her, by, chopping, them, down, but, she, escapes, the, glass, slipper, is, unique, to, charles, perrault, s, version, and, its, derivatives, in, other, versions, of, the, tale, it, may, be, made, of, other, materials, in, the, version, recorded, by, the, brothers, grimm, german, aschenbroedel, and, aschenputtel, for, instance, it, is, gold, and, in, still, other, tellings, it, is, not, a, slipper, but, an, anklet, a, ring, or, a, bracelet, that, gives, the, prince, the, key, to, cinderella, s, identity, what, matters, to, the, story, is, that, the, identifying, item, will, fit, only, one, woman, in, rossini, s, opera, la, cenerentola, cinderella, the, slipper, is, replaced, by, twin, bracelets, to, prove, her, identity, in, the, finnish, variant, the, wonderful, birch, the, prince, uses, tar, to, gain, something, every, ball, and, so, has, a, ring, a, circlet, and, a, pair, of, slippers, some, interpreters, perhaps, troubled, by, sartorial, impracticalities, have, suggested, that, perrault, s, glass, slipper, pantoufle, de, verre, had, been, a, squirrel, fur, slipper, pantoufle, de, vair, in, some, unidentified, earlier, version, of, the, tale, and, that, perrault, or, one, of, his, sources, confused, the, words, however, most, scholars, believe, the, glass, slipper, was, a, deliberate, piece, of, poetic, invention, on, perrault, s, part, nabokov, has, professor, timofey, pnin, assert, as, fact, that, cendrillon, s, shoes, were, not, made, of, glass, but, of, russian, squirrel, fur, vair, in, french, the, 1950, disney, adaptation, takes, advantage, of, the, slipper, being, made, of, glass, to, add, a, twist, whereby, the, slipper, is, shattered, by, the, spiteful, stepmother, just, before, cinderella, has, the, chance, to, try, it, on, earlier, in, the, film, the, duke, warns, that, the, slipper, could, fit, any, number, of, women, but, cinderella, then, produces, the, beautiful, matching, slipper, proving, beyond, all, doubt, that, she, is, the, one, from, the, ball, in, many, variants, of, the, tale, the, prince, is, told, that, cinderella, can, not, possibly, be, the, one, as, she, is, too, dirty, and, ragged, often, this, is, said, by, the, stepmother, or, stepsisters, in, the, grimms, version, both, the, stepmother, and, the, father, urge, it, the, prince, nevertheless, insists, on, her, trying, cinderella, arrives, and, proves, her, identity, by, fitting, into, the, slipper, or, other, item, in, some, cases, she, has, kept, the, other, according, to,
