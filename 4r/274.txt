the, aeneid, n, i, d, ih, nee, id, latin, aen, is, or, is, a, latin, epic, poem, that, tells, the, legendary, story, of, aeneas, a, trojan, who, fled, the, fall, of, troy, and, travelled, to, italy, where, he, became, the, ancestor, of, the, romans, written, by, the, roman, poet, virgil, between, 29, and, 19, bc, the, aeneid, comprises, 9, 896, lines, in, dactylic, hexameter, the, first, six, of, the, poem, s, twelve, books, tell, the, story, of, aeneas, wanderings, from, troy, to, italy, and, the, poem, s, second, half, tells, of, the, trojans, ultimately, victorious, war, upon, the, latins, under, whose, name, aeneas, and, his, trojan, followers, are, destined, to, be, subsumed, the, hero, aeneas, was, already, known, to, greco, roman, legend, and, myth, having, been, a, character, in, the, iliad, virgil, took, the, disconnected, tales, of, aeneas, wanderings, his, vague, association, with, the, foundation, of, rome, and, his, description, as, a, personage, of, no, fixed, characteristics, other, than, a, scrupulous, pietas, and, fashioned, the, aeneid, into, a, compelling, founding, myth, or, national, epic, that, tied, rome, to, the, legends, of, troy, explained, the, punic, wars, glorified, traditional, roman, virtues, and, legitimised, the, julio, claudian, dynasty, as, descendants, of, the, founders, heroes, and, gods, of, rome, and, troy, the, aeneid, is, widely, regarded, as, virgil, s, masterpiece, and, one, of, the, greatest, works, of, latin, literature, the, aeneid, can, be, divided, into, halves, based, on, the, disparate, subject, matter, of, books, 1, 6, aeneas, journey, to, latium, in, italy, commonly, associated, with, homer, s, odyssey, and, books, 7, 12, the, war, in, latium, mirroring, the, iliad, these, two, halves, are, commonly, regarded, as, reflecting, virgil, s, ambition, to, rival, homer, by, treating, both, the, odyssey, s, wandering, theme, and, the, iliad, s, warfare, themes, this, is, however, a, rough, correspondence, the, limitations, of, which, should, be, borne, in, mind, although, the, definitive, story, of, aeneas, escaping, the, fallen, troy, and, finding, a, new, home, in, italy, thus, eventually, becoming, the, ancestor, of, the, romans, was, codified, by, virgil, the, myth, of, aeneas, post, troy, adventures, predates, him, by, centuries, as, greek, settlements, began, to, expand, starting, in, the, sixth, century, bc, greek, colonists, would, often, try, to, connect, their, new, homes, and, the, native, people, they, found, there, to, their, pre, existing, mythology, the, odyssey, containing, odysseus, s, travels, in, many, far, away, lands, already, provided, such, a, link, aeneas, s, story, reflects, not, just, roman, but, rather, a, combination, of, various, greek, etruscan, latin, and, roman, elements, troy, provided, for, a, very, suitable, narrative, for, the, greek, colonists, in, magna, graecia, and, sicily, who, wished, to, link, their, new, homelands, with, themselves, and, the, etruscans, who, would, have, adopted, the, story, of, aeneas, in, italy, first, and, quickly, became, associated, with, him, greek, vases, as, early, as, the, sixth, century, bc, provide, evidence, for, these, early, greek, mythological, accounts, of, aeneas, founding, a, new, home, in, etruria, predating, virgil, by, a, wide, margin, and, he, was, known, to, have, been, worshipped, in, lavinium, the, city, he, founded, the, discovery, of, thirteen, large, altars, in, lavinium, indicates, early, greek, influence, dating, to, the, sixth, through, fourth, century, bc, in, the, following, centuries, the, romans, would, come, in, contact, with, greek, colonies, conquer, them, and, subsume, the, legend, of, aeneas, into, their, own, mythological, narratives, it, is, most, likely, that, they, fully, became, interested, in, greek, myths, and, their, incorporation, into, their, own, foundation, legends, concerning, rome, and, the, roman, people, following, the, war, against, king, pyrrhus, of, epirus, in, 280, bc, as, troy, offered, a, way, to, insert, rome, into, greek, historical, tradition, as, good, as, the, one, it, had, in, the, past, for, greeks, to, link, themselves, to, their, new, lands, virgil, begins, his, poem, with, a, statement, of, his, theme, arma, virumque, cano, of, arms, and, the, man, i, sing, and, an, invocation, to, the, muse, falling, some, seven, lines, after, the, poem, s, inception, musa, mihi, causas, memora, o, muse, recount, to, me, the, causes, he, then, explains, the, reason, for, the, principal, conflict, in, the, story, the, resentment, held, by, the, goddess, juno, against, the, trojan, people, this, is, consistent, with, her, role, throughout, the, homeric, epics, also, in, the, manner, of, homer, the, story, proper, begins, in, medias, res, into, the, middle, of, things, with, the, trojan, fleet, in, the, eastern, mediterranean, heading, in, the, direction, of, italy, the, fleet, led, by, aeneas, is, on, a, voyage, to, find, a, second, home, it, has, been, foretold, that, in, italy, he, will, give, rise, to, a, race, both, noble, and, courageous, a, race, which, will, become, known, to, all, nations, juno, is, wrathful, because, she, had, not, been, chosen, in, the, judgment, of, paris, and, because, her, favourite, city, carthage, will, be, destroyed, by, aeneas, descendants, also, ganymede, a, trojan, prince, was, chosen, to, be, the, cupbearer, to, her, husband, jupiter, replacing, juno, s, daughter, hebe, juno, proceeds, to, aeolus, king, of, the, winds, and, asks, that, he, release, the, winds, to, stir, up, a, storm, in, exchange, for, a, bribe, deiopea, the, loveliest, of, all, her, sea, nymphs, as, a, wife, aeolus, agrees, to, carry, out, juno, s, orders, line, 77, my, task, is, to, fulfill, your, commands, the, storm, then, devastates, the, fleet, neptune, takes, notice, although, he, himself, is, no, friend, of, the, trojans, he, is, infuriated, by, juno, s, intrusion, into, his, domain, and, stills, the, winds, and, calms, the, waters, after, making, sure, that, the, winds, would, not, bother, the, trojans, again, lest, they, be, punished, more, harshly, than, they, were, this, time, the, fleet, takes, shelter, on, the, coast, of, africa, where, aeneas, rouses, the, spirits, of, his, men, reassuring, them, that, they, have, been, through, worse, situations, before, there, aeneas, mother, venus, in, the, form, of, a, huntress, very, similar, to, the, goddess, diana, encourages, him, and, recounts, to, him, the, history,

wooden, horse, the, greeks, pretended, to, sail, away, leaving, a, warrior, sinon, to, mislead, the, trojans, into, believing, that, the, horse, was, an, offering, and, that, if, it, were, taken, into, the, city, the, trojans, would, be, able, to, conquer, greece, the, trojan, priest, laoco, n, saw, through, the, greek, plot, and, urged, the, horse, s, destruction, but, his, protests, fell, on, deaf, ears, so, he, hurled, his, spear, at, the, horse, then, in, what, would, be, seen, by, the, trojans, as, punishment, from, the, gods, two, serpents, emerged, from, the, sea, and, devoured,

aeneas, is, careful, to, reward, winners, and, losers, showing, his, leadership, qualities, by, not, allowing, antagonism, even, after, foul, play, each, of, these, contests, comments, on, past, events, or, prefigures, future, events, the, boxing, match, for, instance, is, a, preview, of, the, final, encounter, of, aeneas, and, turnus, and, the, dove, the, target, during, the, archery,

aeneas, prays, to, jupiter, to, quench, the, fires, which, the, god, does, with, a, torrential, rainstorm, an, anxious, aeneas, is, comforted, by, a, vision, of, his, father, who, tells, him, to, go, to, the, underworld, to, receive, a, vision, of, his, and, rome, s, future, in, return, for, safe, passage, to, italy, the, gods, by, order, of, jupiter, will, receive, one, of, aeneas, men, as, a,

latinus, to, demand, that, lavinia, be, married, to, noble, turnus, brings, forth, anger, in, turnus, which, spurs, him, to, war, with, the, trojans, and, causes, ascanius, to, wound, a, revered, deer, during, a, hunt, hence, although, aeneas, wishes, to, avoid, a, war, hostilities, break, out, the, book, closes, with, a, catalogue, of, italic, warriors, given, the, impending, war, aeneas, seeks, help, from, the, tuscans, enemies, of, the, rutuli, after, having, been, encouraged, to, do, so, in, a, dream, by, tiberinus, at, the, place, where, rome, will, be, he, meets, a, friendly, greek, king, evander, of, arcadia, his, son, pallas, agrees, to, join, aeneas, and, lead, troops, against, the, rutuli, venus, urges, her, spouse, vulcan, to, create, weapons, for, aeneas, which, she, then, presents, to, aeneas, as, a, gift, on, the, shield, the, future, history, of, rome, is, depicted, meanwhile, the, trojan, camp, is, attacked, by, turnus, spurred, on, by, juno, who, informs, him, that, aeneas, is, away, from, his, camp, and, a, midnight, raid, by, the, trojans, nisus, and, euryalus, on, turnus, camp, leads, to, their, death, the, next, day, turnus, manages, to, breach, the, gates, but, is, forced, to, retreat, by, jumping, into, the, tiber, a, council, of, the, gods, is, held, in, which, venus, and, juno, speak, before, jupiter, and, aeneas, returns, to, the, besieged, trojan, camp, accompanied, by, his, new, arcadian, and, tuscan, allies, in, the, ensuing, battle, many, are, slain, notably, pallas, whom, evander, has, entrusted, to, aeneas, but, who, is, killed, by, turnus, mezentius, turnus, close, associate, allows, his, son, lausus, to, be, killed, by, aeneas, while, he, himself, flees, he, reproaches, himself, and, faces, aeneas, in, single, combat, an, honourable, but, essentially, futile, endeavour, leading, to, his, death, after, a, short, break, in, which, the, funeral, ceremony, for, pallas, takes, place, the, war, continues, another, notable, native, camilla, an, amazon, character, and, virgin, devoted, to, diana, fights, bravely, but, is, killed, poisoned, by, the, coward, arruns, who, in, turn, is, struck, dead, by, diana, s, sentinel, opis, single, combat, is, proposed, between, aeneas, and, turnus, but, aeneas, is, so, obviously, superior, to, turnus, that, the, rutuli, urged, on, by, turnus, divine, sister, juturna, who, in, turn, is, instigated, by, juno, break, the, truce, aeneas, is, injured, by, an, arrow, but, is, soon, healed, with, the, help, of, his, mother, venus, and, returns, to, the, battle, turnus, and, aeneas, dominate, the, battle, on, opposite, wings, but, when, aeneas, makes, a, daring, attack, at, the, city, of, latium, causing, the, queen, of, latium, to, hang, herself, in, despair, he, forces, turnus, into, single, combat, once, more, in, the, duel, turnus, strength, deserts, him, as, he, tries, to, hurl, a, rock, and, aeneas, spear, goes, through, his, thigh, as, turnus, is, on, his, knees, begging, for, his, life, the, epic, ends, with, aeneas, initially, tempted, to, obey, turnus, pleas, to, spare, his, life, but, then, killing, him, in, rage, when, he, sees, that, turnus, is, wearing, aeneas, friend, pallas, belt, over, his, shoulder, as, a, trophy, critics, of, the, aeneid, focus, on, a, variety, of, issues, the, tone, of, the, poem, as, a, whole, is, a, particular, matter, of, debate, some, see, the, poem, as, ultimately, pessimistic, and, politically, subversive, to, the, augustan, regime, while, others, view, it, as, a, celebration, of, the, new, imperial, dynasty, virgil, makes, use, of, the, symbolism, of, the, augustan, regime, and, some, scholars, see, strong, associations, between, augustus, and, aeneas, the, one, as, founder, and, the, other, as, re, founder, of, rome, a, strong, teleology, or, drive, towards, a, climax, has, been, detected, in, the, poem, the, aeneid, is, full, of, prophecies, about, the, future, of, rome, the, deeds, of, augustus, his, ancestors, and, famous, romans, and, the, carthaginian, wars, the, shield, of, aeneas, even, depicts, augustus, victory, at, actium, in, 31, bc, a, further, focus, of, study, is, the, character, of, aeneas, as, the, protagonist, of, the, poem, aeneas, seems, to, constantly, waver, between, his, emotions, and, commitment, to, his, prophetic, duty, to, found, rome, critics, note, the, breakdown, of, aeneas, emotional, control, in, the, last, sections, of, the, poem, where, the, pious, and, righteous, aeneas, mercilessly, slaughters, the, latin, warrior, turnus, the, aeneid, appears, to, have, been, a, great, success, virgil, is, said, to, have, recited, books, 2, 4, and, 6, to, augustus, the, mention, of, her, son, marcellus, in, book, 6, apparently, caused, augustus, sister, octavia, to, faint, the, poem, was, unfinished, when, virgil, died, in, 19, bc, according, to, tradition, virgil, traveled, to, greece, around, 19, bc, to, revise, the, aeneid, after, meeting, augustus, in, athens, and, deciding, to, return, home, virgil, caught, a, fever, while, visiting, a, town, near, megara, virgil, crossed, to, italy, by, ship, weakened, with, disease, and, died, in, brundisium, harbour, on, 21, september, 19, bc, leaving, a, wish, that, the, manuscript, of, the, aeneid, was, to, be, burned, augustus, ordered, virgil, s, literary, executors, lucius, varius, rufus, and, plotius, tucca, to, disregard, that, wish, instead, ordering, the, aeneid, to, be, published, with, as, few, editorial, changes, as, possible, 112, as, a, result, the, existing, text, of, the, aeneid, may, contain, faults, which, virgil, was, planning, to, correct, before, publication, however, the, only, obvious, imperfections, are, a, few, lines, of, verse, that, are, metrically, unfinished, i, e, not, a, complete, line, of, dactylic, hexameter, other, alleged, imperfections, are, subject, to, scholarly, debate, the, aeneid, was, written, in, a, time, of, major, political, and, social, change, in, rome, with, the, fall, of, the, republic, and, the, final, war, of, the, roman, republic, having, torn, through, society, and, many, romans, faith, in, the, greatness, of, rome, severely, faltering, however, the, new, emperor, augustus, caesar, began, to, institute, a, new, era, of, prosperity, and, peace, specifically, through, the, re, introduction, of, traditional, roman, moral, values, the, aeneid, was, seen, as, reflecting, this, aim, by, depicting, the, heroic, aeneas, as, a, man, devoted, and, loyal, to, his, country, and, its, prominence, rather, than, his, own, personal, gains, in, addition, the, aeneid, gives, mythic, legitimisation, to, the, rule, of, julius, caesar, and, by, extension, to, his, adopted, son, augustus, by, immortalising, the, tradition, that, renamed, aeneas, son, ascanius, called, ilus, from, ilium, meaning, troy, iulus, thus, making, him, an, ancestor, of, the, gens, julia, the, family, of, julius, caesar, and, many, other, great, imperial, descendants, as, part, of, the, prophecy, given, to, him, in, the, underworld, the, meter, shows, that, the, name, iulus, is, pronounced, as, three, syllables, not, as, julus, the, perceived, deficiency, of, any, account, of, aeneas, marriage, to, lavinia, or, his, founding, of, the, roman, race, led, some, writers, such, as, the, 15th, century, italian, poet, maffeo, vegio, through, his, thirteenth, book, of, the, aeneid, widely, printed, in, the, renaissance, pier, candido, decembrio, whose, attempt, was, never, completed, claudio, salvucci, in, his, 1994, epic, poem, the, laviniad, and, ursula, k, le, guin, in, her, 2008, novel, lavinia, to, compose, their, own, supplements, despite, the, polished, and, complex, nature, of, the, aeneid, legend, stating, that, virgil, wrote, only, three, lines, of, the, poem, each, day, the, number, of, half, complete, lines, and, the, abrupt, ending, are, generally, seen, as, evidence, that, virgil, died, before, he, could, finish, the, work, some, legends, state, that, virgil, fearing, that, he, would, die, before, he, had, properly, revised, the, poem, gave, instructions, to, friends, including, the, current, emperor, augustus, that, the, aeneid, should, be, burned, upon, his, death, owing, to, its, unfinished, state, and, because, he, had, come, to, dislike, one, of, the, sequences, in, book, viii, in, which, venus, and, vulcan, made, love, for, its, nonconformity, to, roman, moral, virtues, the, friends, did, not, comply, with, virgil, s, wishes, and, augustus, himself, ordered, that, they, be, disregarded, after, minor, modifications, the, aeneid, was, published, because, it, was, composed, and, preserved, in, writing, rather, than, orally, the, text, exhibits, less, variation, than, other, classical, epics, as, with, other, classical, latin, poetry, the, meter, is, based, on, the, length, of, syllables, rather, than, the, stress, though, the, interplay, of, meter, and, stress, is, also, important, virgil, also, incorporated, such, poetic, devices, as, alliteration, onomatopoeia, synecdoche, and, assonance, furthermore, he, uses, personification, metaphor, and, simile, in, his, work, usually, to, add, drama, and, tension, to, the, scene, an, example, of, a, simile, can, be, found, in, book, ii, when, aeneas, is, compared, to, a, shepherd, who, stood, on, the, high, top, of, a, rock, unaware, of, what, is, going, on, around, him, it, can, be, seen, that, just, as, the, shepherd, is, a, protector, of, his, sheep, so, too, is, aeneas, to, his, people, as, was, the, rule, in, classical, antiquity, an, author, s, style, was, seen, as, an, expression, of, his, personality, and, character, virgil, s, latin, has, been, praised, for, its, evenness, subtlety, and, dignity, the, aeneid, like, other, classical, epics, is, written, in, dactylic, hexameters, each, line, consists, of, six, metrical, feet, made, up, of, dactyls, one, long, syllable, followed, by, two, short, syllables, and, spondees, two, long, syllables, this, epic, consists, of, twelve, books, and, the, narrative, is, broken, up, into, three, sections, of, four, books, each, respectively, addressing, dido, the, trojans, arrival, in, italy, and, the, war, with, the, latins, each, book, has, roughly, 700, 900, lines, the, aeneid, comes, to, an, abrupt, ending, and, scholars, have, speculated, that, virgil, died, before, he, could, finish, the, poem, the, roman, ideal, of, pietas, piety, dutiful, respect, which, can, be, loosely, translated, from, the, latin, as, a, selfless, sense, of, duty, toward, one, s, filial, religious, and, societal, obligations, was, a, crux, of, ancient, roman, morality, throughout, the, aeneid, aeneas, serves, as, the, embodiment, of, pietas, with, the, phrase, pious, aeneas, occurring, 20, times, throughout, the, poem, thereby, fulfilling, his, capacity, as, the, father, of, the, roman, people, for, instance, in, book, 2, aeneas, describes, how, he, carried, his, father, anchises, from, the, burning, city, of, troy, no, help, or, hope, of, help, existed, so, i, resigned, myself, picked, up, my, father, and, turned, my, face, toward, the, mountain, range, furthermore, aeneas, ventures, into, the, underworld, thereby, fulfilling, anchises, wishes, his, father, s, gratitude, is, presented, in, the, text, by, the, following, lines, have, you, at, last, come, has, that, loyalty, your, father, counted, on, conquered, the, journey, however, aeneas, pietas, extends, beyond, his, devotion, to, his, father, we, also, see, several, examples, of, his, religious, fervour, aeneas, is, consistently, subservient, to, the, gods, even, in, actions, opposed, to, his, own, desires, as, he, responds, to, one, such, divine, command, i, sail, to, italy, not, of, my, own, free, will, in, addition, to, his, religious, and, familial, pietas, aeneas, also, displays, fervent, patriotism, and, devotion, to, his, people, particularly, in, a, military, capacity, for, instance, as, he, and, his, followers, leave, troy, aeneas, swears, that, he, will, take, up, the, combat, once, again, we, shall, not, all, die, this, day, unavenged, aeneas, is, a, symbol, of, pietas, in, all, of, its, forms, serving, as, a, moral, paragon, to, whom, a, roman, should, aspire, one, of, the, most, recurring, themes, in, the, aeneid, is, that, of, divine, intervention, throughout, the, poem, the, gods, are, constantly, influencing, the, main, characters, and, trying, to, change, and, impact, the, outcome, regardless, of, the, fate, that, they, all, know, will, occur, for, example, juno, comes, down, and, acts, as, a, phantom, aeneas, to, drive, turnus, away, from, the, real, aeneas, and, all, of, his, rage, from, the, death, of, pallas, even, though, juno, knows, in, the, end, that, aeneas, will, triumph, over, turnus, she, does, all, she, can, to, delay, and, avoid, this, outcome, divine, intervention, occurs, multiple, times, in, book, 4, especially, aeneas, falls, in, love, with, dido, delaying, his, ultimate, fate, of, travelling, to, italy, however, it, is, actually, the, gods, who, inspired, the, love, as, juno, plots, dido, and, the, trojan, captain, to, one, same, cavern, i, shall, be, on, hand, and, if, i, can, be, certain, you, are, willing, there, i, shall, marry, them, and, call, her, his, a, wedding, this, will, be, juno, is, speaking, to, venus, making, an, agreement, and, influencing, the, lives, and, emotions, of, both, dido, and, aeneas, later, in, the, same, book, jupiter, steps, in, and, restores, what, is, the, true, fate, and, path, for, aeneas, sending, mercury, down, to, aeneas, dreams, telling, him, that, he, must, travel, to, italy, and, leave, his, new, found, lover, as, aeneas, later, pleads, with, dido, the, gods, interpreter, sent, by, jove, himself, i, swear, it, by, your, head, and, mine, has, brought, commands, down, through, the, racing, winds, i, sail, for, italy, not, of, my, own, free, will, several, of, the, gods, try, to, intervene, against, the, powers, of, fate, even, though, they, know, what, the, eventual, outcome, will, be, the, interventions, are, really, just, distractions, to, continue, the, conflict, and, postpone, the, inevitable, if, the, gods, represent, humans, just, as, the, human, characters, engage, in, conflicts, and, power, struggles, so, too, do, the, gods, fate, described, as, a, preordained, destiny, that, men, and, gods, have, to, follow, is, a, major, theme, in, the, aeneid, one, example, is, when, aeneas, is, reminded, of, his, fate, through, jupiter, and, mercury, while, he, is, falling, in, love, with, dido, mercury, urges, think, of, your, expectations, of, your, heir, iulus, to, whom, the, whole, italian, realm, the, land, of, rome, are, due, mercury, is, referring, to, aeneas, preordained, fate, to, found, rome, as, well, as, rome, s, preordained, fate, to, rule, the, world, he, was, to, be, ruler, of, italy, potential, empire, armorer, of, war, to, father, men, from, teucer, s, noble, blood, and, bring, the, whole, world, under, law, s, dominion, it, is, important, to, recognise, that, there, is, a, marked, difference, between, fate, and, divine, intervention, as, even, though, the, gods, might, remind, mortals, of, their, eventual, fate, the, gods, themselves, are, not, in, control, of, it, for, example, the, opening, lines, of, the, poem, specify, that, aeneas, came, to, italy, by, destiny, but, is, also, harassed, by, the, separate, force, of, baleful, juno, in, her, sleepless, rage, even, though, juno, might, intervene, aeneas, fate, is, set, in, stone, and, cannot, be, changed, later, in, book, 6, when, aeneas, visits, the, underworld, his, father, anchises, introduces, him, to, the, larger, fate, of, the, roman, people, as, contrasted, against, his, own, personal, fate, to, found, rome, so, raptly, everywhere, father, and, son, wandered, the, airy, plain, and, viewed, it, all, after, anchises, had, conducted, him, to, every, region, and, had, fired, his, love, of, glory, in, the, years, to, come, he, spoke, of, wars, that, he, might, fight, of, laurentines, and, of, latinus, city, then, of, how, he, might, avoid, or, bear, each, toil, to, come, from, the, very, beginning, of, the, aeneid, violence, and, conflict, are, used, as, a, means, of, survival, and, conquest, aeneas, voyage, is, caused, by, the, trojan, war, and, the, destruction, of, troy, aeneas, describes, to, dido, in, book, 2, the, massive, amount, of, destruction, that, occurs, after, the, greeks, sneak, into, troy, he, recalls, that, he, asks, his, men, to, defend, a, city, lost, in, flames, come, let, us, die, we, ll, make, a, rush, into, the, thick, of, it, this, is, one, of, the, first, demonstrations, of, the, way, in, which, violence, begets, violence, even, though, the, trojans, know, they, have, lost, the, battle, they, continue, to, fight, for, their, country, this, violence, continues, as, aeneas, makes, his, journey, dido, kills, herself, in, order, to, end, and, escape, her, worldly, problem, being, heartbroken, over, the, departure, of, aeneas, and, now, left, alone, surrounded, by, violent, rulers, who, desire, her, and, her, throne, queen, dido, s, suicide, is, a, double, edged, sword, while, releasing, herself, from, the, burden, of, her, pain, through, violence, her, last, words, implore, her, people, to, view, aeneas, people, with, hate, for, all, eternity, this, is, my, last, cry, as, my, last, blood, flows, then, o, my, tyrians, besiege, with, hate, his, progeny, and, all, his, race, to, come, make, this, your, offering, to, my, dust, no, love, no, pact, must, be, between, our, peoples, furthermore, her, people, hearing, of, their, queen, s, death, have, only, one, avenue, on, which, to, direct, the, blame, the, already, departed, trojans, thus, dido, s, request, of, her, people, and, her, people, s, only, recourse, for, closure, align, in, their, mutual, hate, for, aeneas, and, his, trojans, in, effect, dido, s, violent, suicide, leads, to, the, violent, nature, of, the, later, relationship, between, carthage, and, rome, finally, when, aeneas, arrives, in, latium, conflict, inevitably, arises, juno, sends, alecto, one, of, the, furies, to, cause, turnus, to, go, against, aeneas, in, the, ensuing, battles, turnus, kills, pallas, who, is, supposed, to, be, under, aeneas, protection, this, act, of, violence, causes, aeneas, to, be, consumed, with, fury, although, turnus, asks, for, mercy, in, their, final, encounter, when, aeneas, sees, that, turnus, has, taken, pallas, sword, belt, aeneas, proclaims, you, in, your, plunder, torn, from, one, of, mine, shall, i, be, robbed, of, you, this, wound, will, come, from, pallas, pallas, makes, this, offering, and, from, your, criminal, blood, exacts, his, due, this, final, act, of, violence, shows, how, turnus, violence, the, act, of, killing, pallas, inevitably, leads, to, more, violence, and, his, own, death, it, is, possible, that, the, recurring, theme, of, violence, in, the, aeneid, is, a, subtle, commentary, on, the, bloody, violence, contemporary, readers, would, have, just, experienced, during, the, late, republican, civil, wars, the, aeneid, potentially, explores, whether, the, violence, of, the, civil, wars, was, necessary, to, establish, a, lasting, peace, under, augustus, or, whether, it, would, just, lead, to, more, violence, in, the, future, written, during, the, reign, of, augustus, the, aeneid, presents, the, hero, aeneas, as, a, strong, and, powerful, leader, the, favourable, representation, of, aeneas, parallels, augustus, in, that, it, portrays, his, reign, in, a, progressive, and, admirable, light, and, allows, augustus, to, be, positively, associated, with, the, portrayal, of, aeneas, although, virgil, s, patron, maecenas, was, obviously, not, augustus, himself, he, was, still, a, high, figure, within, augustus, administration, and, could, have, personally, benefitted, from, representing, aeneas, in, a, positive, light, in, the, aeneid, aeneas, is, portrayed, as, the, singular, hope, for, the, rebirth, of, the, trojan, people, charged, with, the, preservation, of, his, people, by, divine, authority, aeneas, is, symbolic, of, augustus, own, accomplishments, in, establishing, order, after, the, long, period, of, chaos, of, the, roman, civil, wars, augustus, as, the, light, of, savior, and, the, last, hope, of, the, roman, people, is, a, parallel, to, aeneas, as, the, savior, of, the, trojans, this, parallel, functions, as, propaganda, in, support, of, augustus, as, it, depicts, the, trojan, people, future, romans, themselves, as, uniting, behind, a, single, leader, who, will, lead, them, out, of, ruin, new, refugees, in, a, great, crowd, men, and, women, gathered, for, exile, young, pitiful, people, coming, from, every, quarter, minds, made, up, with, their, belongings, for, whatever, lands, i, d, lead, them, to, by, sea, later, in, book, 6, aeneas, travels, to, the, underworld, where, he, sees, his, father, anchises, who, tells, him, of, his, own, destiny, as, well, as, that, of, the, roman, people, anchises, describes, how, aeneas, descendant, romulus, will, found, the, great, city, of, rome, which, will, eventually, be, ruled, by, caesar, augustus, turn, your, two, eyes, this, way, and, see, this, people, your, own, romans, here, is, caesar, and, all, the, line, of, iulus, all, who, shall, one, day, pass, under, the, dome, of, the, great, sky, this, is, the, man, this, one, of, whom, so, often, you, have, heard, the, promise, caesar, augustus, son, of, the, deified, who, shall, bring, once, again, an, age, of, gold, to, latium, to, the, land, where, saturn, reigned, in, early, times, virgil, writes, about, the, fated, future, of, lavinium, the, city, that, aeneas, will, found, which, will, in, turn, lead, directly, to, the, golden, reign, of, augustus, virgil, is, using, a, form, of, literary, propaganda, to, demonstrate, the, augustan, regime, s, destiny, to, bring, glory, and, peace, to, rome, rather, than, use, aeneas, indirectly, as, a, positive, parallel, to, augustus, as, in, other, parts, of, the, poem, virgil, outright, praises, the, emperor, in, book, 6, referring, to, augustus, as, a, harbinger, for, the, glory, of, rome, and, new, levels, of, prosperity, the, poem, abounds, with, smaller, and, greater, allegories, two, of, the, debated, allegorical, sections, pertain, to, the, exit, from, the, underworld, and, to, pallas, belt, there, are, two, gates, of, sleep, one, said, to, be, of, horn, whereby, the, true, shades, pass, with, ease, the, other, all, white, ivory, agleam, without, a, flaw, and, yet, false, dreams, are, sent, through, this, one, by, the, ghost, to, the, upper, world, anchises, now, his, last, instructions, given, took, son, and, sibyl, and, let, them, go, by, the, ivory, gate, aeneas, leaving, the, underworld, through, the, gate, of, false, dreams, has, been, variously, interpreted, one, suggestion, is, that, the, passage, simply, refers, to, the, time, of, day, at, which, aeneas, returned, to, the, world, of, the, living, another, is, that, it, implies, that, all, of, aeneas, actions, in, the, remainder, of, the, poem, are, somehow, false, in, an, extension, of, the, latter, interpretation, it, has, been, suggested, that, virgil, is, conveying, that, the, history, of, the, world, since, the, foundation, of, rome, is, but, a, lie, other, scholars, claim, that, virgil, is, establishing, that, the, theological, implications, of, the, preceding, scene, an, apparent, system, of, reincarnation, are, not, to, be, taken, as, literal, the, second, section, in, question, is, then, to, his, glance, appeared, the, accurst, swordbelt, surmounting, turnus, shoulder, shining, with, its, familiar, studs, the, strap, young, pallas, wore, when, turnus, wounded, him, and, left, him, dead, upon, the, field, now, turnus, bore, that, enemy, token, on, his, shoulder, enemy, still, for, when, the, sight, came, home, to, him, aeneas, raged, at, the, relic, of, his, anguish, worn, by, this, man, as, trophy, blazing, up, and, terrible, in, his, anger, he, called, out, you, in, your, plunder, torn, from, one, of, mine, shall, i, be, robbed, of, you, this, wound, will, come, from, pallas, pallas, makes, this, offering, and, from, your, criminal, blood, exacts, his, due, he, sank, his, blade, in, fury, in, turnus, chest, this, section, has, been, interpreted, to, mean, that, for, the, entire, passage, of, the, poem, aeneas, who, symbolises, pietas, piety, or, morality, in, a, moment, becomes, furor, fury, thus, destroying, what, is, essentially, the, primary, theme, of, the, poem, itself, many, have, argued, over, these, two, sections, some, claim, that, virgil, meant, to, change, them, before, he, died, while, others, find, that, the, location, of, the, two, passages, at, the, very, end, of, the, so, called, volume, i, books, 1, 6, the, odyssey, and, volume, ii, books, 7, 12, the, iliad, and, their, short, length, which, contrasts, with, the, lengthy, nature, of, the, poem, are, evidence, that, virgil, placed, them, purposefully, there, the, aeneid, is, a, cornerstone, of, the, western, canon, and, early, at, least, by, the, 2nd, century, ad, became, one, of, the, essential, elements, of, a, latin, education, usually, required, to, be, memorised, even, after, the, decline, of, the, roman, empire, it, remained, central, to, a, latin, education, in, latin, christian, culture, the, aeneid, was, one, of, the, canonical, texts, subjected, to, commentary, as, a, philological, and, educational, study, with, the, most, complete, commentary, having, been, written, by, the, 4th, century, grammarian, maurus, servius, honoratus, it, was, widely, held, to, be, the, pinnacle, of, latin, literature, much, in, the, same, way, that, the, iliad, was, seen, to, be, supreme, in, greek, literature, the, strong, influence, of, the, aeneid, has, been, identified, in, the, development, of, european, vernacular, literatures, some, english, works, that, show, its, influence, being, beowulf, layamon, s, brut, through, the, source, text, historia, regum, britanniae, the, faerie, queene, and, milton, s, paradise, lost, the, italian, poet, dante, alighieri, was, himself, profoundly, influenced, by, the, aeneid, so, much, so, that, his, magnum, opus, the, divine, comedy, itself, widely, considered, central, to, the, western, canon, includes, a, number, of, quotations, from, and, allusions, to, the, aeneid, and, features, the, author, virgil, as, a, major, character, the, guide, of, dante, through, the, realms, of, the, inferno, and, purgatorio, another, continental, work, displaying, the, influence, of, the, aeneid, is, the, 16th, century, portuguese, epic, os, lus, adas, written, by, lu, s, de, cam, es, and, dealing, with, vasco, da, gama, s, voyage, to, india, the, importance, of, latin, education, itself, was, paramount, in, western, culture, from, 1600, to, 1900, the, latin, school, was, at, the, centre, of, european, education, wherever, it, was, found, within, that, latin, school, virgil, was, taught, at, the, advanced, level, and, in, 19th, century, england, special, editions, of, virgil, were, awarded, to, students, who, distinguished, themselves, in, the, united, states, virgil, and, specifically, the, aeneid, were, taught, in, the, fourth, year, of, a, latin, sequence, at, least, until, the, 1960s, the, current, 2011, advanced, placement, curriculum, in, latin, continues, to, assign, a, central, position, to, the, poem, the, ap, latin, virgil, exam, is, designed, to, test, the, student, s, ability, to, read, translate, understand, analyze, and, interpret, the, lines, of, the, aeneid, that, appear, on, the, course, syllabus, in, latin, many, phrases, from, this, poem, entered, the, latin, language, much, as, passages, from, shakespeare, and, alexander, pope, have, entered, the, english, language, one, example, is, from, aeneas, reaction, to, a, painting, of, the, sack, of, troy, sunt, lacrimae, rerum, et, mentem, mortalia, tangunt, these, are, the, tears, of, things, and, our, mortality, cuts, to, the, heart, aeneid, i, 462, the, influence, is, also, visible, in, very, modern, work, brian, friel, s, translations, a, play, written, in, the, 1980s, set, in, 19th, century, ireland, makes, references, to, the, classics, throughout, and, ends, with, a, passage, from, the, aeneid, urbs, antiqua, fuit, there, was, an, ancient, city, which, tis, said, juno, loved, above, all, the, lands, and, it, was, the, goddess, aim, and, cherished, hope, that, here, should, be, the, capital, of, all, nations, should, the, fates, perchance, allow, that, yet, in, truth, she, discovered, that, a, race, was, springing, from, trojan, blood, to, overthrow, some, day, these, tyrian, towers, a, people, late, regem, belloque, superbum, kings, of, broad, realms, and, proud, in, war, who, would, come, forth, for, libya, s, downfall, the, first, full, and, faithful, rendering, of, the, poem, in, an, anglic, language, is, the, scots, translation, by, gavin, douglas, his, eneados, completed, in, 1513, which, also, included, maffeo, vegio, s, supplement, even, in, the, 20th, century, ezra, pound, considered, this, still, to, be, the, best, aeneid, translation, praising, the, richness, and, fervour, of, its, language, and, its, hallmark, fidelity, to, the, original, the, english, translation, by, the, 17th, century, poet, john, dryden, is, another, important, version, most, classic, translations, including, both, douglas, and, dryden, employ, a, rhyme, scheme, most, more, modern, attempts, do, not, recent, english, verse, translations, include, those, by, patric, dickinson, 1961, british, poet, laureate, cecil, day, lewis, 1963, who, strove, to, render, virgil, s, original, hexameter, line, allen, mandelbaum, honoured, by, a, 1973, national, book, award, library, of, congress, poet,
