an, electric, guitar, is, a, guitar, that, requires, external, amplification, in, order, to, be, heard, at, typical, performance, volumes, unlike, a, standard, acoustic, guitar, it, uses, one, or, more, pickups, to, convert, the, vibration, of, its, strings, into, electrical, signals, which, ultimately, are, reproduced, as, sound, by, loudspeakers, the, sound, is, sometimes, shaped, or, electronically, altered, to, achieve, different, timbres, or, tonal, qualities, from, that, of, an, acoustic, guitar, via, amplifier, settings, or, knobs, on, the, guitar, often, this, is, done, through, the, use, of, effects, such, as, reverb, distortion, and, overdrive, the, latter, is, considered, to, be, a, key, element, of, electric, blues, guitar, music, and, jazz, rock, and, heavy, metal, guitar, playing, designs, also, exist, combining, attributes, of, the, electric, and, acoustic, guitars, the, semi, acoustic, and, acoustic, electric, guitars, invented, in, 1932, the, electric, guitar, was, adopted, by, jazz, guitar, players, who, wanted, to, play, single, note, guitar, solos, in, large, big, band, ensembles, early, proponents, of, the, electric, guitar, on, record, include, les, paul, eddie, durham, george, barnes, lonnie, johnson, sister, rosetta, tharpe, t, bone, walker, and, charlie, christian, during, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, the, electric, guitar, became, the, most, important, instrument, in, popular, music, it, has, evolved, into, an, instrument, that, is, capable, of, a, multitude, of, sounds, and, styles, in, genres, ranging, from, pop, and, rock, to, folk, to, country, music, blues, and, jazz, it, served, as, a, major, component, in, the, development, of, electric, blues, rock, and, roll, rock, music, heavy, metal, music, and, many, other, genres, of, music, electric, guitar, design, and, construction, varies, greatly, in, the, shape, of, the, body, and, the, configuration, of, the, neck, bridge, and, pickups, guitars, may, have, a, fixed, bridge, or, a, spring, loaded, hinged, bridge, which, lets, players, bend, the, pitch, of, notes, or, chords, up, or, down, or, perform, vibrato, effects, the, sound, of, an, electric, guitar, can, be, modified, by, new, playing, techniques, such, as, string, bending, tapping, and, hammering, on, using, audio, feedback, or, slide, guitar, playing, there, are, several, types, of, electric, guitar, early, forms, were, hollow, body, semi, acoustic, guitars, while, solid, body, guitars, developed, later, string, configurations, include, the, six, string, guitar, the, most, common, type, which, is, usually, tuned, e, a, d, g, b, e, from, lowest, to, highest, strings, the, seven, string, guitar, which, typically, adds, a, low, b, string, below, the, low, e, the, eight, string, guitar, which, typically, adds, a, low, e, or, f, string, below, the, low, b, and, the, twelve, string, guitar, which, has, six, two, string, courses, similar, to, a, mandolin, in, rock, the, electric, guitar, is, often, used, in, two, roles, as, a, rhythm, guitar, which, plays, the, chord, sequences, or, progressions, and, riffs, and, sets, the, beat, as, part, of, a, rhythm, section, and, as, a, lead, guitar, which, provides, instrumental, melody, lines, melodic, instrumental, fill, passages, and, solos, in, a, small, group, such, as, a, power, trio, one, guitarist, may, switch, between, both, roles, in, larger, groups, there, is, often, a, rhythm, guitarist, and, a, lead, guitarist, many, experiments, with, electrically, amplifying, the, vibrations, of, a, string, instrument, were, made, dating, back, to, the, early, part, of, the, 20th, century, patents, from, the, 1910s, show, telephone, transmitters, were, adapted, and, placed, inside, violins, and, banjos, to, amplify, the, sound, hobbyists, in, the, 1920s, used, carbon, button, microphones, attached, to, the, bridge, however, these, detected, vibrations, from, the, bridge, on, top, of, the, instrument, resulting, in, a, weak, signal, electric, guitars, were, originally, designed, by, acoustic, guitar, makers, and, instrument, manufacturers, the, demand, for, amplified, guitars, began, during, the, big, band, era, as, orchestras, increased, in, size, guitar, players, soon, realized, the, necessity, in, guitar, amplification, and, electrification, the, first, electric, guitars, used, in, jazz, were, hollow, archtop, acoustic, guitar, bodies, with, electromagnetic, transducers, the, first, electrically, amplified, stringed, instrument, to, be, marketed, commercially, was, a, cast, aluminium, lap, steel, guitar, nicknamed, the, frying, pan, designed, in, 1931, by, george, beauchamp, the, general, manager, of, the, national, stringed, instrument, corporation, with, paul, barth, who, was, vice, president, george, beauchamp, along, with, adolph, rickenbacker, invented, the, electromagnetic, pickups, coils, that, were, wrapped, around, a, magnet, would, create, an, electromagnetic, field, that, converted, the, vibrations, of, the, guitar, strings, into, electrical, signals, which, could, then, be, amplified, commercial, production, began, in, late, summer, of, 1932, by, the, ro, pat, in, corporation, elect, ro, pat, ent, in, strument, company, in, los, angeles, a, partnership, of, beauchamp, adolph, rickenbacker, originally, rickenbacher, and, paul, barth, in, 1934, the, company, was, renamed, the, rickenbacker, electro, stringed, instrument, company, in, that, year, beauchamp, applied, for, a, united, states, patent, for, an, electrical, stringed, musical, instrument, and, the, patent, was, later, issued, in, 1937, by, the, time, it, was, patented, other, manufacturers, were, already, making, their, own, electric, guitar, designs, early, electric, guitar, manufacturers, include, rickenbacker, in, 1932, dobro, in, 1933, national, audiovox, and, volu, tone, in, 1934, vega, epiphone, electrophone, and, electar, and, gibson, in, 1935, and, many, others, by, 1936, by, early, mid, 1935, electro, string, instrument, corporation, had, achieved, success, with, the, frying, pan, and, set, out, to, capture, a, new, audience, through, its, release, of, the, electro, spanish, model, b, and, the, electro, spanish, ken, roberts, which, was, the, first, full, 25, inch, scale, electric, guitar, ever, produced, the, electro, spanish, ken, roberts, was, revolutionary, for, its, time, providing, players, a, full, 25, inch, scale, with, easy, access, to, 17, frets, free, of, the, body, unlike, other, lap, steel, electrified, instruments, produced, during, the, time, the, electro, spanish, ken, roberts, was, designed, to, play, while, standing, upright, with, the, guitar, on, a, strap, as, with, acoustic, guitars, the, electro, spanish, ken, roberts, was, also, the, first, instrument, to, feature, a, hand, operated, vibrato, as, a, standard, arrangement, a, device, called, the, vibrola, invented, by, doc, kauffman, it, is, estimated, that, fewer, than, 50, electro, spanish, ken, roberts, were, constructed, between, 1933, and, 1937, fewer, than, 10, are, known, to, survive, today, the, solid, body, electric, guitar, is, made, of, solid, wood, without, functionally, resonating, air, spaces, the, first, solid, body, spanish, standard, guitar, was, offered, by, vivi, tone, no, later, than, 1934, this, model, featured, a, guitar, shaped, body, of, a, single, sheet, of, plywood, affixed, to, a, wood, frame, another, early, substantially, solid, spanish, electric, guitar, called, the, electro, spanish, was, marketed, by, the, rickenbacker, guitar, company, in, 1935, and, made, of, bakelite, by, 1936, the, slingerland, company, introduced, a, wooden, solid, body, electric, model, the, slingerland, songster, 401, and, a, lap, steel, counterpart, the, songster, 400, gibson, s, first, production, electric, guitar, marketed, in, 1936, was, the, es, 150, model, es, for, electric, spanish, and, 150, reflecting, the, 150, price, of, the, instrument, along, with, matching, amplifier, the, es, 150, guitar, featured, a, single, coil, hexagonally, shaped, bar, pickup, which, was, designed, by, walt, fuller, it, became, known, as, the, charlie, christian, pickup, named, for, the, jazz, guitarist, who, was, among, the, first, to, perform, with, the, es, 150, guitar, the, es, 150, achieved, some, popularity, but, suffered, from, unequal, loudness, across, the, six, strings, a, functioning, solid, body, electric, guitar, was, designed, and, built, in, 1940, by, les, paul, from, an, epiphone, acoustic, archtop, as, an, experiment, his, log, guitar, a, wood, post, with, a, neck, attached, and, two, hollow, body, halves, attached, to, the, sides, for, appearance, only, shares, nothing, in, common, for, design, or, hardware, with, the, solid, body, gibson, les, paul, designed, by, ted, mccarty, and, introduced, in, 1952, the, feedback, associated, with, amplified, hollow, bodied, electric, guitars, was, understood, long, before, paul, s, log, was, created, in, 1940, gage, brewer, s, ro, pat, in, of, 1932, had, a, top, so, heavily, reinforced, that, it, essentially, functioned, as, a, solid, body, instrument, unlike, acoustic, guitars, solid, body, electric, guitars, have, no, vibrating, soundboard, to, amplify, string, vibration, instead, solid, body, instruments, depend, on, electric, pickups, and, an, amplifier, amp, and, speaker, the, solid, body, ensures, that, the, amplified, sound, reproduces, the, string, vibration, alone, thus, avoiding, the, wolf, tones, and, unwanted, feedback, associated, with, amplified, acoustic, guitars, these, guitars, are, generally, made, of, hardwood, covered, with, a, hard, polymer, finish, often, polyester, or, lacquer, in, large, production, facilities, the, wood, is, stored, for, three, to, six, months, in, a, wood, drying, kiln, before, being, cut, to, shape, premium, custom, built, guitars, are, frequently, made, with, much, older, hand, selected, wood, one, of, the, first, solid, body, guitars, was, invented, by, les, paul, gibson, did, not, present, their, gibson, les, paul, guitar, prototypes, to, the, public, as, they, did, not, believe, the, solid, body, style, would, catch, on, another, early, solid, body, spanish, style, guitar, resembling, what, would, become, gibson, s, les, paul, guitar, a, decade, later, was, developed, in, 1941, by, o, w, appleton, of, nogales, arizona, appleton, made, contact, with, both, gibson, and, fender, but, was, unable, to, sell, the, idea, behind, his, app, guitar, to, either, company, in, 1946, merle, travis, commissioned, steel, guitar, builder, paul, bigsby, to, build, him, a, solid, body, spanish, style, electric, bigsby, delivered, the, guitar, in, 1948, the, first, mass, produced, solid, body, guitar, was, fender, esquire, and, fender, broadcaster, later, to, become, the, fender, telecaster, first, made, in, 1950, five, years, after, les, paul, made, his, prototype, the, gibson, les, paul, appeared, soon, after, to, compete, with, the, broadcaster, another, notable, solid, body, design, is, the, fender, stratocaster, which, was, introduced, in, 1954, and, became, extremely, popular, among, musicians, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, for, its, wide, tonal, capabilities, and, more, comfortable, ergonomics, than, other, models, different, styles, of, guitar, have, different, pick, up, styles, the, main, being, 2, or, 3, single, coil, pick, ups, or, a, double, humbucker, with, the, stratocaster, being, a, triple, single, coil, guitar, the, history, of, electric, guitars, has, been, summarized, by, guitar, world, magazine, and, the, earliest, electric, guitar, on, their, top, 10, list, is, the, ro, pat, in, electro, a, 25, frying, pan, 1932, described, as, the, first, fully, functioning, solid, body, electric, guitar, to, be, manufactured, and, sold, it, was, the, first, electric, guitar, used, in, a, publicly, promoted, performance, performed, by, gage, brewer, in, wichita, kansas, in, october, 1932, the, most, recent, electric, guitar, on, this, list, was, the, ibanez, jem, 1987, which, featured, 24, frets, an, impossibly, thin, neck, and, was, designed, to, be, the, ultimate, shredder, machine, numerous, other, important, electric, guitars, are, on, the, list, including, gibson, es, 150, 1936, fender, telecaster, 1951, gibson, les, paul, 1952, gretsch, 6128, duo, jet, 1953, fender, stratocaster, 1954, rickenbacker, 360, 12, 1964, van, halen, frankenstrat, 1975, paul, reed, smith, custom, 1985, many, of, these, guitars, were, successors, to, earlier, designs, electric, guitar, designs, eventually, became, culturally, important, and, visually, iconic, with, various, model, companies, selling, miniature, model, versions, of, particularly, famous, electric, guitars, for, example, the, gibson, sg, used, by, angus, young, from, the, group, ac, dc, some, otherwise, solid, bodied, guitars, such, as, the, gibson, les, paul, supreme, the, prs, singlecut, and, the, fender, telecaster, thinline, are, built, with, hollow, chambers, in, the, body, these, chambers, are, designed, to, not, interfere, with, the, critical, bridge, and, string, anchor, point, on, the, solid, body, in, the, case, of, gibson, and, prs, these, are, called, chambered, bodies, the, motivation, for, this, may, be, to, reduce, weight, to, achieve, a, semi, acoustic, tone, see, below, or, both, semi, acoustic, guitars, have, a, hollow, body, similar, to, an, acoustic, guitar, and, electromagnetic, pickups, mounted, directly, into, the, body, they, work, in, a, similar, way, to, solid, body, electric, guitars, except, that, because, the, hollow, body, also, vibrates, the, pickups, convert, a, combination, of, string, and, body, vibration, into, an, electrical, signal, many, models, known, as, semi, hollow, bodies, have, a, solid, block, running, through, the, middle, of, the, soundbox, designed, to, reduce, acoustic, feedback, they, do, not, provide, enough, acoustic, volume, for, live, performance, but, they, can, be, used, unplugged, for, quiet, practice, semi, acoustic, guitars, are, noted, for, being, able, to, provide, a, sweet, plaintive, or, funky, tone, they, are, used, in, many, genres, including, jazz, blues, funk, sixties, pop, and, indie, rock, they, generally, have, cello, style, f, shaped, sound, holes, which, can, be, blocked, off, to, further, reduce, feedback, whereas, chambered, guitars, are, made, like, solid, body, guitars, from, a, single, block, of, wood, semi, acoustic, guitar, bodies, are, made, from, multiple, pieces, of, wood, in, an, archtop, form, a, method, of, construction, different, from, the, typical, steel, string, acoustic, guitar, the, top, is, formed, from, a, moderately, thick, piece, of, wood, which, is, then, carved, into, a, thin, outward, curving, shape, whereas, conventional, acoustic, guitars, have, a, thin, flat, top, some, steel, string, acoustic, guitars, include, a, built, in, system, to, electrically, amplify, their, output, without, altering, their, tone, as, an, alternative, to, using, a, separate, microphone, the, system, may, consist, of, piezoelectric, pickups, mounted, under, the, bridge, or, a, low, mass, microphone, usually, a, condenser, mic, inside, the, body, of, the, guitar, that, converts, the, vibrations, in, the, body, into, electronic, signals, combinations, of, these, types, of, pickups, may, be, used, with, an, integral, mixer, preamp, graphic, equalizer, such, instruments, are, called, electric, acoustic, guitars, they, are, regarded, as, acoustic, guitars, rather, than, electric, guitars, because, the, pickups, do, not, produce, a, signal, directly, from, the, vibration, of, the, strings, but, rather, from, the, vibration, of, the, guitar, top, or, body, and, the, amplification, of, the, sound, merely, increases, volume, not, alters, tone, electric, guitar, design, and, construction, vary, greatly, in, the, shape, of, the, body, and, the, configuration, of, the, neck, bridge, and, pickups, however, some, features, are, present, on, most, guitars, the, photo, below, shows, the, different, parts, of, an, electric, guitar, the, headstock, 1, contains, the, metal, machine, heads, 1, 1, which, use, a, worm, gear, for, tuning, the, nut, 1, 4, a, thin, fret, like, strip, of, metal, plastic, graphite, or, bone, supports, the, strings, at, the, headstock, end, of, the, instrument, the, frets, 2, 3, are, thin, metal, strips, that, stop, the, string, at, the, correct, pitch, when, the, player, pushes, a, string, against, the, fingerboard, the, truss, rod, 1, 2, is, a, metal, rod, usually, adjustable, that, counters, the, tension, of, the, strings, to, keep, the, neck, straight, position, markers, 2, 2, provide, the, player, with, a, reference, to, the, playing, position, on, the, fingerboard, the, neck, and, fretboard, 2, 1, extend, from, the, body, at, the, neck, joint, 2, 4, the, neck, is, either, glued, or, bolted, to, the, body, the, body, 3, is, typically, made, of, wood, with, a, hard, polymerized, finish, strings, vibrating, in, the, magnetic, field, of, the, pickups, 3, 1, 3, 2, produce, an, electric, current, in, the, pickup, winding, that, passes, through, the, tone, and, volume, controls, 3, 8, to, the, output, jack, some, guitars, have, piezo, pickups, in, addition, to, or, instead, of, magnetic, pickups, some, guitars, have, a, fixed, bridge, 3, 4, others, have, a, spring, loaded, hinged, bridge, called, a, vibrato, bar, tremolo, bar, or, whammy, bar, which, lets, players, bend, notes, or, chords, up, or, down, in, pitch, or, perform, a, vibrato, embellishment, a, plastic, pickguard, on, some, guitars, protects, the, body, from, scratches, or, covers, the, control, cavity, which, holds, most, of, the, wiring, the, degree, to, which, the, choice, of, woods, and, other, materials, in, the, solid, guitar, body, 3, affects, the, sonic, character, of, the, amplified, signal, is, disputed, many, believe, it, is, highly, significant, while, others, think, the, difference, between, woods, is, subtle, in, acoustic, and, archtop, guitars, wood, choices, more, clearly, affect, tone, woods, typically, used, in, solid, body, electric, guitars, include, alder, brighter, but, well, rounded, swamp, ash, similar, to, alder, but, with, more, pronounced, highs, and, lows, mahogany, dark, bassy, warm, poplar, similar, to, alder, and, basswood, very, neutral, maple, a, very, bright, tonewood, is, also, a, popular, body, wood, but, is, very, heavy, for, this, reason, it, is, often, placed, as, a, cap, on, a, guitar, made, primarily, of, another, wood, cheaper, guitars, are, often, made, of, cheaper, woods, such, as, plywood, pine, or, agathis, not, true, hardwoods, which, can, affect, durability, and, tone, though, most, guitars, are, made, of, wood, any, material, may, be, used, materials, such, as, plastic, metal, and, even, cardboard, have, been, used, in, some, instruments, the, guitar, output, jack, typically, provides, a, monaural, signal, many, guitars, with, active, electronics, use, a, jack, with, an, extra, contact, normally, used, for, stereo, these, guitars, use, the, extra, contact, to, break, the, ground, connection, to, the, on, board, battery, to, preserve, battery, life, when, the, guitar, is, unplugged, these, guitars, require, a, mono, plug, to, close, the, internal, switch, and, connect, the, battery, to, ground, standard, guitar, cables, use, a, high, impedance, 1, 4, inch, 6, 35, mm, mono, plug, these, have, a, tip, and, sleeve, configuration, referred, to, as, a, ts, phone, connector, the, voltage, is, usually, around, 1, to, 9, millivolts, a, few, guitars, such, as, rickenbacker, guitars, equipped, with, rick, o, sound, feature, stereo, output, there, are, a, variety, of, ways, the, stereo, effect, may, be, implemented, commonly, but, not, exclusively, stereo, guitars, route, the, neck, and, bridge, pickups, to, separate, output, buses, on, the, guitar, a, stereo, cable, then, routes, each, pickup, to, its, signal, chain, or, amplifier, for, these, applications, the, most, popular, connector, is, a, high, impedance, 1, 4, inch, 6, 35, mm, plug, with, a, tip, ring, and, sleeve, configuration, also, known, as, a, trs, phone, connector, some, studio, instruments, notably, certain, gibson, les, paul, models, incorporate, a, low, impedance, three, pin, xlr, connector, for, balanced, audio, many, exotic, arrangements, and, connectors, exist, that, support, features, such, as, midi, and, hexaphonic, pickups, the, bridge, and, tailpiece, while, serving, separate, purposes, work, closely, together, to, affect, playing, style, and, tone, there, are, four, basic, types, of, bridge, and, tailpiece, systems, on, electric, guitars, within, these, four, types, are, many, variants, a, hard, tail, guitar, bridge, anchors, the, strings, at, or, directly, behind, the, bridge, and, is, fastened, securely, to, the, top, of, the, instrument, these, are, common, on, carved, top, guitars, such, as, the, gibson, les, paul, and, the, paul, reed, smith, models, and, on, slab, body, guitars, such, as, the, music, man, albert, lee, and, fender, guitars, that, are, not, equipped, with, a, vibrato, arm, a, floating, or, trapeze, tailpiece, similar, to, a, violin, s, fastens, to, the, body, at, the, base, of, the, guitar, these, appear, on, rickenbackers, gretsches, epiphones, a, wide, variety, of, archtop, guitars, particularly, jazz, guitars, and, the, 1952, gibson, les, paul, pictured, is, a, tremolo, arm, or, vibrato, tailpiece, style, bridge, and, tailpiece, system, often, called, a, whammy, bar, or, trem, it, uses, a, lever, vibrato, arm, attached, to, the, bridge, that, can, temporarily, slacken, or, tighten, the, strings, to, alter, the, pitch, a, player, can, use, this, to, create, a, vibrato, or, a, portamento, effect, early, vibrato, systems, were, often, unreliable, and, made, the, guitar, go, out, of, tune, easily, they, also, had, a, limited, pitch, range, later, fender, designs, were, better, but, fender, held, the, patent, on, these, so, other, companies, used, older, designs, for, many, years, with, the, expiration, of, the, fender, patent, on, the, stratocaster, style, vibrato, various, improvements, on, this, type, of, internal, multi, spring, vibrato, system, are, now, available, floyd, rose, introduced, one, of, the, first, improvements, on, the, vibrato, system, in, many, years, when, in, the, late, 1970s, he, experimented, with, locking, nuts, and, bridges, that, prevent, the, guitar, from, losing, tuning, even, under, heavy, vibrato, bar, use, the, fourth, type, of, system, employs, string, through, body, anchoring, the, strings, pass, over, the, bridge, saddles, then, through, holes, through, the, top, of, the, guitar, body, to, the, back, the, strings, are, typically, anchored, in, place, at, the, back, of, the, guitar, by, metal, ferrules, many, believe, this, design, improves, a, guitar, s, sustain, and, timbre, a, few, examples, of, string, through, body, guitars, are, the, fender, telecaster, thinline, the, fender, telecaster, deluxe, the, b, c, rich, it, warlock, and, mockingbird, and, the, schecter, omen, 6, and, 7, series, compared, to, an, acoustic, guitar, which, has, a, hollow, body, electric, guitars, make, much, less, audible, sound, when, their, strings, are, plucked, so, electric, guitars, are, normally, plugged, into, a, guitar, amplifier, and, speaker, when, an, electric, guitar, is, played, string, movement, produces, a, signal, by, generating, i, e, inducing, a, small, electric, current, in, the, magnetic, pickups, which, are, magnets, wound, with, coils, of, very, fine, wire, the, signal, passes, through, the, tone, and, volume, circuits, to, the, output, jack, and, through, a, cable, to, an, amplifier, the, current, induced, is, proportional, to, such, factors, as, string, density, and, the, amount, of, movement, over, the, pickups, because, of, their, natural, qualities, magnetic, pickups, tend, to, pick, up, ambient, usually, unwanted, electromagnetic, interference, or, emi, this, mains, hum, results, in, a, tone, of, 50, or, 60, cycles, per, second, depending, on, the, powerline, frequency, of, the, local, alternating, current, supply, the, resulting, hum, is, particularly, strong, with, single, coil, pickups, double, coil, or, humbucker, pickups, were, invented, as, a, way, to, reduce, or, counter, the, sound, as, they, are, designed, to, buck, in, the, verb, sense, of, oppose, or, resist, the, hum, hence, their, name, the, high, combined, inductance, of, the, two, coils, also, leads, to, the, richer, fatter, tone, associated, with, humbucking, pickups, electric, guitar, necks, vary, in, composition, and, shape, the, primary, metric, of, guitar, necks, is, the, scale, length, which, is, the, vibrating, length, of, the, strings, from, nut, to, bridge, a, typical, fender, guitar, uses, a, 25, 5, inch, 65, cm, scale, length, while, gibson, uses, a, 24, 75, inch, 62, 9, cm, scale, length, in, their, les, paul, while, the, scale, length, of, the, les, paul, is, often, described, as, 24, 75, inches, it, has, varied, through, the, years, by, as, much, as, a, half, inch, frets, are, positioned, proportionally, to, scale, length, the, shorter, the, scale, length, the, closer, the, fret, spacing, opinions, vary, regarding, the, effect, of, scale, length, on, tone, and, feel, popular, opinion, holds, that, longer, scale, length, contributes, to, greater, amplitude, reports, of, playing, feel, are, greatly, complicated, by, the, many, factors, involved, in, this, perception, string, gauge, and, design, neck, construction, and, relief, guitar, setup, playing, style, and, other, factors, contribute, to, the, subjective, impression, of, playability, or, feel, necks, are, described, as, bolt, on, set, in, or, neck, through, depending, on, how, they, attach, to, the, body, set, in, necks, are, glued, to, the, body, at, the, factory, this, is, the, traditional, type, of, joint, leo, fender, pioneered, bolt, on, necks, on, electric, guitars, to, facilitate, easy, adjustment, and, replacement, neck, through, instruments, extend, the, neck, to, the, length, of, the, instrument, so, that, it, forms, the, center, of, the, body, while, a, set, in, neck, can, be, carefully, unglued, by, a, skilled, luthier, and, a, bolt, on, neck, can, simply, be, unscrewed, a, neck, through, design, is, difficult, or, even, impossible, to, repair, depending, on, the, damage, historically, the, bolt, on, style, has, been, more, popular, for, ease, of, installation, and, adjustment, since, bolt, on, necks, can, be, easily, removed, there, is, an, after, market, in, replacement, bolt, on, necks, from, companies, such, as, warmoth, and, mighty, mite, some, instruments, notably, most, gibson, models, continue, to, use, set, in, glued, necks, neck, through, bodies, are, somewhat, more, common, in, bass, guitars, materials, for, necks, are, selected, for, dimensional, stability, and, rigidity, and, some, allege, that, they, influence, tone, hardwoods, are, preferred, with, maple, mahogany, and, ash, topping, the, list, the, neck, and, fingerboard, can, be, made, from, different, materials, for, example, a, guitar, may, have, a, maple, neck, with, a, rosewood, or, ebony, fingerboard, today, there, are, expensive, and, budget, guitars, exploring, other, options, for, fretboard, wood, for, instance, pau, ferro, both, for, availability, and, cheap, price, while, still, maintaining, quality, in, the, 1970s, designers, began, to, use, exotic, human, made, materials, such, as, aircraft, grade, aluminum, carbon, fiber, and, ebonol, makers, known, for, these, unusual, materials, include, john, veleno, travis, bean, geoff, gould, and, alembic, aside, from, possible, engineering, advantages, some, feel, that, with, the, rising, cost, of, rare, tonewoods, human, made, materials, may, be, economically, preferable, and, more, ecologically, sensitive, however, wood, remains, popular, in, production, instruments, though, sometimes, in, conjunction, with, new, materials, vigier, guitars, for, example, use, a, wooden, neck, reinforced, by, embedding, a, light, carbon, fiber, rod, in, place, of, the, usual, heavier, steel, bar, or, adjustable, steel, truss, rod, after, market, necks, made, entirely, from, carbon, fiber, fit, existing, bolt, on, instruments, few, if, any, extensive, formal, investigations, have, been, widely, published, that, confirm, or, refute, claims, over, the, effects, of, different, woods, or, materials, on, the, electric, guitar, sound, several, neck, shapes, appear, on, guitars, including, shapes, known, as, c, necks, u, necks, and, v, necks, these, refer, to, the, cross, sectional, shape, of, the, neck, especially, near, the, nut, several, sizes, of, fret, wire, are, available, with, traditional, players, often, preferring, thin, frets, and, metal, shredders, liking, thick, frets, thin, frets, are, considered, better, for, playing, chords, while, thick, frets, allow, lead, guitarists, to, bend, notes, with, less, effort, an, electric, guitar, with, a, folding, neck, called, the, foldaxe, was, designed, and, built, for, chet, atkins, by, roger, c, field, steinberger, guitars, developed, a, line, of, exotic, carbon, fiber, instruments, without, headstocks, with, tuning, done, on, the, bridge, instead, fingerboards, vary, as, much, as, necks, the, fingerboard, surface, usually, has, a, cross, sectional, radius, that, is, optimized, to, accommodate, finger, movement, for, different, playing, techniques, fingerboard, radius, typically, ranges, from, nearly, flat, a, very, large, radius, to, radically, arched, a, small, radius, the, vintage, fender, telecaster, for, example, has, a, typical, small, radius, of, approximately, 7, 25, inches, 18, 4, cm, some, manufacturers, have, experimented, with, fret, profile, and, material, fret, layout, number, of, frets, and, modifications, of, the, fingerboard, surface, for, various, reasons, some, innovations, were, intended, to, improve, playability, by, ergonomic, means, such, as, warmoth, guitars, compound, radius, fingerboard, scalloped, fingerboards, added, enhanced, microtonality, during, fast, legato, runs, fanned, frets, intend, to, provide, each, string, with, an, optimal, playing, tension, and, enhanced, musicality, some, guitars, have, no, frets, while, others, like, the, gittler, guitar, have, no, neck, in, the, traditional, sense
