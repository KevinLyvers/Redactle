the, great, sphinx, of, giza, is, a, limestone, statue, of, a, reclining, sphinx, a, mythical, creature, with, the, head, of, a, human, and, the, body, of, a, lion, facing, directly, from, west, to, east, it, stands, on, the, giza, plateau, on, the, west, bank, of, the, nile, in, giza, egypt, the, face, of, the, sphinx, appears, to, represent, the, pharaoh, khafre, the, original, shape, of, the, sphinx, was, cut, from, bedrock, and, has, since, been, restored, with, layers, of, limestone, blocks, it, measures, 73, m, 240, ft, long, from, paw, to, tail, 20, m, 66, ft, high, from, the, base, to, the, top, of, the, head, and, 19, m, 62, ft, wide, at, its, rear, haunches, the, sphinx, is, the, oldest, known, monumental, sculpture, in, egypt, and, one, of, the, most, recognizable, statues, in, the, world, the, archaeological, evidence, suggests, that, it, was, created, by, ancient, egyptians, of, the, old, kingdom, during, the, reign, of, khafre, c, 2558, 2532, bc, the, circumstances, surrounding, the, sphinx, s, nose, being, broken, off, are, uncertain, but, close, inspection, suggests, a, deliberate, act, using, rods, or, chisels, contrary, to, a, popular, myth, it, was, not, broken, off, by, cannonfire, from, napoleon, s, troops, during, his, 1798, egyptian, campaign, its, absence, is, in, fact, depicted, in, artwork, predating, napoleon, and, referred, to, in, descriptions, by, the, 15th, century, historian, al, maqr, z, the, original, name, the, old, kingdom, creators, gave, the, sphinx, is, unknown, as, the, sphinx, temple, enclosure, and, possibly, the, sphinx, itself, was, not, completed, at, the, time, and, thus, cultural, material, was, limited, in, the, new, kingdom, the, sphinx, was, revered, as, the, solar, deity, hor, em, akhet, english, horus, of, the, horizon, hellenized, harmachis, and, the, pharaoh, thutmose, iv, 1401, 1391, or, 1397, 1388, bc, specifically, referred, to, it, as, such, in, his, dream, stele, the, commonly, used, name, sphinx, was, given, to, it, in, classical, antiquity, about, 2, 000, years, after, the, commonly, accepted, date, of, its, construction, by, reference, to, a, greek, mythological, beast, with, the, head, of, a, woman, a, falcon, a, cat, or, a, sheep, and, the, body, of, a, lion, with, the, wings, of, an, eagle, although, like, most, egyptian, sphinxes, the, great, sphinx, has, a, man, s, head, and, no, wings, the, english, word, sphinx, comes, from, the, ancient, greek, transliterated, sphinx, apparently, from, the, verb, transliterated, sphingo, english, to, squeeze, after, the, greek, sphinx, who, strangled, anyone, who, failed, to, answer, her, riddle, medieval, arab, writers, including, al, maqr, z, call, the, sphinx, by, an, arabized, coptic, name, belhib, arabic, balhubah, arabic, belhawiyya, arabic, which, in, turn, comes, from, pehor, ancient, egyptian, p, wr, or, pehor, o, n, ancient, egyptian, p, wr, w, n, a, name, of, the, canaanite, god, hauron, with, whom, the, sphinx, was, identified, it, is, also, rendered, as, ablehon, on, a, depiction, of, the, sphinx, made, by, fran, ois, de, la, boullaye, le, gouz, the, modern, egyptian, arabic, name, is, abu, alh, l, abu, alhawl, ipa, the, terrifying, one, literally, father, of, dread, which, is, a, phono, semantic, matching, of, the, coptic, name, the, archaeological, evidence, suggests, that, the, great, sphinx, was, created, around, 2500, bc, for, the, pharaoh, khafre, the, builder, of, the, second, pyramid, at, giza, the, sphinx, is, a, monolith, carved, from, the, bedrock, of, the, plateau, which, also, served, as, the, quarry, for, the, pyramids, and, other, monuments, in, the, area, egyptian, geologist, farouk, el, baz, has, suggested, that, the, head, of, the, sphinx, may, have, been, carved, first, out, of, a, natural, yardang, i, e, a, ridge, of, bedrock, that, had, been, sculpted, by, the, wind, these, can, sometimes, achieve, shapes, that, resemble, animals, el, baz, suggests, that, the, moat, or, ditch, around, the, sphinx, may, have, been, quarried, out, later, to, allow, for, the, creation, of, the, full, body, of, the, sculpture, the, stones, cut, from, around, the, sphinx, s, body, were, used, to, construct, a, temple, in, front, of, it, however, neither, the, enclosure, nor, the, temple, were, ever, completed, and, the, relative, scarcity, of, old, kingdom, cultural, material, suggests, that, a, sphinx, cult, was, not, established, at, the, time, selim, hassan, writing, in, 1949, on, recent, excavations, of, the, sphinx, enclosure, made, note, of, this, circumstance, taking, all, things, into, consideration, it, seems, that, we, must, give, the, credit, of, erecting, this, the, world, s, most, wonderful, statue, to, khafre, but, always, with, this, reservation, that, there, is, not, one, single, contemporary, inscription, which, connects, the, sphinx, with, khafre, so, sound, as, it, may, appear, we, must, treat, the, evidence, as, circumstantial, until, such, time, as, a, lucky, turn, of, the, spade, of, the, excavator, will, reveal, to, the, world, a, definite, reference, to, the, erection, of, the, sphinx, in, order, to, construct, the, temple, the, northern, perimeter, wall, of, the, khafre, valley, temple, had, to, be, deconstructed, hence, it, follows, that, the, khafre, funerary, complex, preceded, the, creation, of, the, sphinx, and, its, temple, furthermore, the, angle, and, location, of, the, south, wall, of, the, enclosure, suggests, the, causeway, connecting, khafre, s, pyramid, and, valley, temple, already, existed, before, the, sphinx, was, planned, the, lower, base, level, of, the, sphinx, temple, also, indicates, that, it, does, not, pre, date, the, valley, temple, some, time, around, the, first, intermediate, period, the, giza, necropolis, was, abandoned, and, drifting, sand, eventually, buried, the, sphinx, up, to, its, shoulders, the, first, documented, attempt, at, an, excavation, dates, to, c, 1400, bc, when, the, young, thutmose, iv, 1401, 1391, or, 1397, 1388, bc, gathered, a, team, and, after, much, effort, managed, to, dig, out, the, front, paws, between, which, he, erected, a, shrine, that, housed, the, dream, stele, an, inscribed, granite, slab, possibly, a, repurposed, door, lintel, from, one, of, khafre, s, temples, when, the, stele, was, discovered, its, lines, of, text, were, already, damaged, and, incomplete, an, excerpt, reads, the, royal, son, thothmos, being, arrived, while, walking, at, midday, and, seating, himself, under, the, shadow, of, this, mighty, god, was, overcome, by, slumber, and, slept, at, the, very, moment, when, ra, is, at, the, summit, he, found, that, the, majesty, of, this, august, god, spoke, to, him, with, his, own, mouth, as, a, father, speaks, to, his, son, saying, look, upon, me, contemplate, me, o, my, son, thothmos, i, am, thy, father, harmakhis, khopri, ra, tum, i, bestow, upon, thee, the, sovereignty, over, my, domain, the, supremacy, over, the, living, behold, my, actual, condition, that, thou, mayest, protect, all, my, perfect, limbs, the, sand, of, the, desert, whereon, i, am, laid, has, covered, me, save, me, causing, all, that, is, in, my, heart, to, be, executed, the, dream, stele, associates, the, sphinx, with, khafre, however, this, part, of, the, text, is, not, entirely, intact, which, we, bring, for, him, oxen, and, all, the, young, vegetables, and, we, shall, give, praise, to, wenofer, khaf, the, statue, made, for, atum, hor, em, akhet, egyptologist, thomas, young, finding, the, khaf, hieroglyphs, in, a, damaged, cartouche, used, to, surround, a, royal, name, inserted, the, glyph, ra, to, complete, khafre, s, name, when, the, stele, was, re, excavated, in, 1925, the, lines, of, text, referring, to, khaf, flaked, off, and, were, destroyed, later, ramesses, ii, the, great, 1279, 1213, bc, may, have, undertaken, a, second, excavation, in, the, new, kingdom, the, sphinx, became, more, specifically, associated, with, the, sun, god, hor, em, akhet, hellenized, harmachis, or, horus, at, the, horizon, the, pharaoh, amenhotep, ii, 1427, 1401, or, 1397, bc, built, a, temple, to, the, northeast, of, the, sphinx, nearly, 1, 000, years, after, its, construction, and, dedicated, it, to, the, cult, of, hor, em, akhet, in, graeco, roman, times, giza, had, become, a, tourist, destination, the, monuments, were, regarded, as, antiquities, and, some, roman, emperors, visited, the, sphinx, out, of, curiosity, and, for, political, reasons, the, sphinx, was, cleared, of, sand, again, in, the, first, century, ad, in, honor, of, emperor, nero, and, the, governor, of, egypt, tiberius, claudius, balbilus, a, monumental, stairway, more, than, 12, metres, 39, ft, wide, was, erected, leading, to, a, pavement, in, front, of, the, paws, of, the, sphinx, at, the, top, of, the, stairs, a, podium, was, positioned, that, allowed, a, view, into, the, sphinx, sanctuary, farther, back, another, podium, neighbored, several, more, steps, the, stairway, was, dismantled, during, the, 1931, 32, excavations, by, mile, baraize, pliny, the, elder, describes, the, face, of, the, sphinx, being, colored, red, and, gives, measurements, for, the, statue, a, stela, dated, to, 166, ad, commemorates, the, restoration, of, the, retaining, walls, surrounding, the, sphinx, the, last, emperor, connected, with, the, monument, is, septimius, severus, around, 200, ad, with, the, downfall, of, roman, power, the, sphinx, was, once, more, engulfed, by, the, sands, some, ancient, non, egyptians, saw, the, sphinx, as, a, likeness, of, the, god, hauron, the, cult, of, the, sphinx, continued, into, medieval, times, the, sabians, of, harran, saw, it, as, the, burial, place, of, hermes, trismegistus, arab, authors, described, the, sphinx, as, a, talisman, that, guarded, the, area, from, the, desert, al, maqrizi, describes, it, as, the, talisman, of, the, nile, that, the, locals, believed, the, flood, cycle, depended, upon, muhammad, al, idrisi, stated, that, those, wishing, to, obtain, bureaucratic, positions, in, the, egyptian, government, gave, incense, offering, to, the, monument, over, the, centuries, writers, and, scholars, have, recorded, their, impressions, and, reactions, upon, seeing, the, sphinx, the, vast, majority, were, concerned, with, a, general, description, often, including, a, mixture, of, science, romance, and, mystique, a, typical, description, of, the, sphinx, by, tourists, and, leisure, travelers, throughout, the, 19th, and, 20th, century, was, made, by, john, lawson, stoddard, it, is, the, antiquity, of, the, sphinx, which, thrills, us, as, we, look, upon, it, for, in, itself, it, has, no, charms, the, desert, s, waves, have, risen, to, its, breast, as, if, to, wrap, the, monster, in, a, winding, sheet, of, gold, the, face, and, head, have, been, mutilated, by, moslem, fanatics, the, mouth, the, beauty, of, whose, lips, was, once, admired, is, now, expressionless, yet, grand, in, its, loneliness, veiled, in, the, mystery, of, unnamed, ages, the, relic, of, egyptian, antiquity, stands, solemn, and, silent, in, the, presence, of, the, awful, desert, symbol, of, eternity, here, it, disputes, with, time, the, empire, of, the, past, forever, gazing, on, and, on, into, a, future, which, will, still, be, distant, when, we, like, all, who, have, preceded, us, and, looked, upon, its, face, have, lived, our, little, lives, and, disappeared, from, the, 16th, to, the, 19th, centuries, european, observers, described, the, sphinx, having, the, face, neck, and, breast, of, a, woman, examples, included, johannes, helferich, 1579, george, sandys, 1615, johann, michael, vansleb, 1677, beno, t, de, maillet, 1735, and, elliot, warburton, 1844, most, early, western, images, were, book, illustrations, in, print, form, elaborated, by, a, professional, engraver, from, either, previous, images, available, or,

while, fran, ois, de, la, boullaye, le, gouz, s, sphinx, had, a, rounded, hairdo, with, bulky, collar, richard, pococke, s, sphinx, was, an, adoption, of, cornelis, de, bruijn, s, drawing, of, 1698, featuring, only, minor, changes, but, is, closer, to, the, actual, appearance, of, the, sphinx, than, anything, previous, the, print, versions, of, norden, s, drawings, for, his, voyage, d, egypte, et, de, nubie, 1755, clearly, show, that, the, nose, was, missing, in, 1817, the, first, modern, archaeological, dig, supervised, by, the, italian, giovanni, battista, caviglia, uncovered, the, sphinx, s, chest, completely, in, the, beginning, of, the, year, 1887, the, chest, the, paws, the, altar, and, plateau, were, all, made, visible, flights, of, steps, were, unearthed, and, finally, accurate, measurements, were, taken, of, the, great, figures, the, height, from, the, lowest, of, the, steps, was, found, to, be, one, hundred, feet, and, the, space, between, the, paws, was, found, to, be, thirty, five, feet, long, and, ten, feet, wide, here, there, was, formerly, an, altar, and, a, stele, of, th, tmosis, iv, was, discovered, recording, a, dream, in, which, he, was, ordered, to, clear, away, the, sand, that, even, then, was, gathering, round, the, site, of, the, sphinx, one, of, the, people, working, on, clearing, the, sands, from, around, the, great, sphinx, was, eug, ne, gr, baut, a, french, director, of, the, antiquities, service, early, egyptologists, and, excavators, were, of, divided, opinion, regarding, the, age, of, the, sphinx, and, the, associated, temples, in, 1857, auguste, mariette, founder, of, the, egyptian, museum, in, cairo, unearthed, the, much, later, inventory, stela, estimated, to, be, from, the, twenty, sixth, dynasty, c, 664, 525, bc, which, tells, how, khufu, came, upon, the, sphinx, already, buried, in, sand, although, certain, tracts, on, the, stela, are, likely, accurate, this, passage, is, contradicted, by, archaeological, evidence, thus, considered, to, be, late, period, historical, revisionism, a, purposeful, fake, created, by, the, local, priests, as, an, attempt, to, imbue, the, contemporary, isis, temple, with, an, ancient, history, it, never, had, such, acts, became, common, when, religious, institutions, such, as, temples, shrines, and, priests, domains, were, fighting, for, political, attention, and, for, financial, and, economic, donations, flinders, petrie, wrote, in, 1883, regarding, the, state, of, opinion, of, the, age, of, the, khafre, valley, temple, and, by, extension, the, sphinx, the, date, of, the, granite, temple, has, been, so, positively, asserted, to, be, earlier, than, the, fourth, dynasty, that, it, may, seem, rash, to, dispute, the, point, recent, discoveries, however, strongly, show, that, it, was, really, not, built, before, the, reign, of, khafre, in, the, fourth, dynasty, gaston, maspero, the, french, egyptologist, and, second, director, of, the, egyptian, museum, in, cairo, conducted, a, survey, of, the, sphinx, in, 1886, he, concluded, that, because, the, dream, stela, showed, the, cartouche, of, khafre, in, line, 13, it, was, he, who, was, responsible, for, the, excavation, and, therefore, the, sphinx, must, predate, khafre, and, his, predecessors, possibly, fourth, dynasty, c, 2575, 2467, bc, maspero, believed, the, sphinx, to, be, the, most, ancient, monument, in, egypt, ludwig, borchardt, attributed, the, sphinx, to, the, middle, kingdom, arguing, that, the, particular, features, seen, on, the, sphinx, are, unique, to, the, 12th, dynasty, and, that, the, sphinx, resembles, amenemhat, iii, e, a, wallis, budge, agreed, that, the, sphinx, predated, khafre, s, reign, writing, in, the, gods, of, the, egyptians, 1904, this, marvelous, object, was, in, existence, in, the, days, of, khafre, or, khephren, and, it, is, probable, that, it, is, a, very, great, deal, older, than, his, reign, and, that, it, dates, from, the, end, of, the, archaic, period, selim, hassan, reasoned, that, the, sphinx, was, erected, after, the, completion, of, the, khafre, pyramid, complex, rainer, stadelmann, former, director, of, the, german, archaeological, institute, in, cairo, examined, the, distinct, iconography, of, the, nemes, headdress, and, the, now, detached, beard, of, the, sphinx, and, concluded, the, style, is, more, indicative, of, the, pharaoh, khufu, 2589, 2566, bc, known, to, the, greeks, as, cheops, builder, of, the, great, pyramid, of, giza, and, khafre, s, father, he, supports, this, by, suggesting, khafre, s, causeway, was, built, to, conform, to, a, pre, existing, structure, which, he, concludes, given, its, location, could, only, have, been, the, sphinx, in, 2004, vassil, dobrev, of, the, institut, fran, ais, d, arch, ologie, orientale, in, cairo, announced, he, had, uncovered, new, evidence, that, the, great, sphinx, may, have, been, the, work, of, the, little, known, pharaoh, djedefre, 2528, 2520, bc, khafre, s, half, brother, and, a, son, of, khufu, dobrev, suggests, djedefre, built, the, sphinx, in, the, image, of, his, father, khufu, identifying, him, with, the, sun, god, ra, in, order, to, restore, respect, for, their, dynasty, dobrev, also, says, that, the, causeway, connecting, khafre, s, pyramid, to, the, temples, was, built, around, the, sphinx, suggesting, it, was, already, in, existence, at, the, time, egyptologist, nigel, strudwick, responded, to, dobrev, saying, that, it, is, not, implausible, but, i, would, need, more, explanation, such, as, why, he, thinks, the, pyramid, at, abu, roash, is, a, sun, temple, something, i, m, sceptical, about, i, have, never, heard, anyone, suggest, that, the, name, in, the, graffiti, at, zawiyet, el, aryan, mentions, djedefre, i, remain, more, convinced, by, the, traditional, argument, of, it, being, khafre, or, the, more, recent, theory, of, it, being, khufu, geologist, colin, reader, suggests, that, water, runoff, from, the, giza, plateau, is, responsible, for, the, differential, erosion, on, the, walls, of, the, sphinx, enclosure, because, the, hydrological, characteristics, of, the, area, were, significantly, changed, by, the, quarries, he, contends, this, suggests, that, the, sphinx, likely, predated, the, quarries, and, thus, the, pyramids, he, points, towards, the, larger, cyclopean, stones, in, part, of, the, sphinx, temple, as, well, as, the, causeway, alignment, with, the, pyramids, and, the, break, in, the, quarries, as, evidence, that, the, pyramids, took, the, alignment, with, some, pre, existing, structure, such, as, the, sphinx, into, consideration, when, they, were, constructed, and, that, the, sphinx, temple, was, built, in, two, distinct, phases, he, contends, that, such, erosion, could, have, occurred, relatively, rapidly, and, suggests, that, the, sphinx, was, no, more, than, a, few, centuries, older, than, present, archaeology, would, suggest, suggesting, a, late, predynastic, or, early, dynastic, origin, when, ancient, egyptians, already, were, known, to, be, capable, of, sophisticated, masonry, in, 1931, engineers, of, the, egyptian, government, repaired, the, head, of, the, sphinx, part, of, its, headdress, had, fallen, off, in, 1926, due, to, erosion, which, had, also, cut, deeply, into, its, neck, this, questionable, repair, was, by, the, addition, of, a, concrete, collar, between, the, headdress, and, the, neck, creating, an, altered, profile, many, renovations, to, the, stone, base, and, raw, rock, body, were, done, in, the, 1980s, and, then, redone, in, the, 1990s, the, nummulitic, limestone, of, the, area, consists, of, layers, which, offer, differing, resistance, to, erosion, mostly, caused, by, wind, and, windblown, sand, leading, to, the, uneven, degradation, apparent, in, the, sphinx, s, body, the, lowest, part, of, the, body, including, the, legs, is, solid, rock, the, body, of, the, animal, up, to, its, neck, is, fashioned, from, softer, layers, that, have, suffered, considerable, disintegration, the, layer, in, which, the, head, was, sculpted, is, much, harder, a, number, of, dead, end, shafts, are, known, to, exist, within, and, below, the, body, of, the, great, sphinx, most, likely, dug, by, treasure, hunters, and, tomb, robbers, examination, of, the, sphinx, s, face, shows, that, long, rods, or, chisels, were, hammered, into, the, nose, area, one, down, from, the, bridge, and, another, beneath, the, nostril, then, used, to, pry, the, nose, off, towards, the, south, resulting, in, the, one, metre, wide, nose, still, being, lost, to, date, many, folk, tales, exist, regarding, the, destruction, of, its, nose, aiming, to, provide, an, answer, as, to, where, it, went, or, what, happened, to, it, one, tale, erroneously, attributes, it, to, cannonballs, fired, by, the, army, of, napoleon, bonaparte, this, is, considered, false, since, drawings, of, the, sphinx, by, frederic, louis, norden, in, 1737, already, show, the, nose, missing, predating, napoleon, s, arrival, by, sixty, years, the, damaged, nose, has, also, been, attributed, by, some, 10th, century, arab, authors, stating, that, it, was, a, result, of, iconoclastic, attacks, besides, this, there, was, also, mention, of, the, damage, being, the, work, of, the, mamluks, in, the, 14th, century, according, to, ibn, qadi, shuhba, muhammad, ibn, sadiq, ibn, al, muhammad, al, tibrizi, al, masri, d, 1384, desecrated, the, sphinxes, of, qanatir, al, siba, built, by, sultan, baybars, the, arab, historian, al, maqr, z, writing, in, the, early, 15th, century, attributes, the, loss, of, the, nose, to, muhammad, sa, im, al, dahr, a, sufi, muslim, from, the, khanqah, of, sa, id, al, su, ada, in, 1378, who, found, local, peasants, making, offerings, to, the, sphinx, in, the, hope, of, increasing, their, harvest, and, therefore, defaced, the, sphinx, in, an, act, of, iconoclasm, according, to, al, maqr, z, many, people, living, in, the, area, believed, that, the, increased, sand, covering, the, giza, plateau, was, retribution, for, al, dahr, s, act, of, defacement, al, minufi, 1443, 1527, meanwhile, mentioned, that, the, alexandrian, crusade, in, 1365, was, divine, retribution, for, muhammad, sa, im, al, dahr, s, breaking, off, the, nose, of, a, sphinx, in, addition, to, the, lost, nose, a, ceremonial, pharaonic, beard, is, thought, to, have, been, attached, although, this, may, have, been, added, in, later, periods, after, the, original, construction, egyptologist, vassil, dobrev, has, suggested, that, had, the, beard, been, an, original, part, of, the, sphinx, it, would, have, damaged, the, chin, of, the, statue, upon, falling, residues, of, red, pigment, are, visible, on, areas, of, the, sphinx, s, face, and, traces, of, yellow, and, blue, pigment, have, also, been, found, elsewhere, on, the, sphinx, leading, mark, lehner, to, suggest, that, the, monument, was, once, decked, out, in, gaudy, comic, book,

the, sphinx, itself, was, speaking, many, new, kingdom, stelae, depict, the, sphinx, wearing, a, crown, if, it, in, fact, existed, the, hole, could, have, been, the, anchoring, point, for, it, mile,

the, sphinx, s, nemes, headdress, a, major, natural, fissure, in, the, bedrock, cuts, through, the, waist, of, the, sphinx, first, excavated, by, auguste, mariette, in, 1853, at, the, top, of, the, back, it, measures, up, to, 2, metres, 6, 6, ft, in, width, baraize, in, 1926, sealed, the, sides, and, roofed, it, with, iron, bars, limestone, and, cement, and, installed, an, iron, trap, door, at, the, top, the, sides, of, the, fissure, might, have, been, artificially, squared, however, the, bottom, is, irregular, bedrock, about, 1, metre, 3, 3, ft, above, the, outside, floor, a, very, narrow, crack, continues, deeper, in, 1926, the, sphinx, was, cleared, of, sand, under, direction, of, baraize, which, revealed, an, opening, to, a, tunnel, at, floor, level, at, the, north, side, of, the, rump, it, was, subsequently, closed, by, masonry, veneer, and, nearly, forgotten, more, than, fifty, years, later, the, existence, of, the, passage, was, recalled, by, three, elderly, men, who, had, worked, during, the, clearing, as, basket, carriers, this, led, to, the, rediscovery, and, excavation, of, the, rump, passage, in, 1980, the, passage, consists, of, an, upper, and, a, lower, section, which, are, angled, roughly, 90, degrees, to, each, other, it, is, possible, that, the, entire, passage, was, cut, top, down, beginning, high, up, on, the, rump, and, that, the, current, access, point, at, floor, level, was, made, at, a, later, date, vyse, noted, in, his, diary, february, 27, and, 28, 1837, that, he, was, boring, near, the, tail, which, indicates, him, as, the, creator, of, the, passage, as, no, other, tunnel, has, been, identified, at, this, location, another, interpretation, is, that, the, shaft, is, of, ancient, origin, perhaps, an, exploratory, tunnel, or, an, unfinished, tomb, shaft, a, 1925, photograph, shows, a, man, standing, below, floor, level, in, a, niche, in, the, sphinx, s, core, body, it, was, closed, during, the, 1925, 1926, restorations, another, hole, might, have, been, at, floor, level, in, the, large, masonry, box, on, the, south, side, of, the, sphinx, the, space, behind, the, dream, stele, between, the, paws, of, the, sphinx, was, covered, by, an, iron, beam, and, cement, roof, which, was, fitted, with, an, iron, trap, door, at, the, ledge, of, the, sphinx, enclosure, a, square, shaft, is, located, opposite, the, northern, hind, paw, it, was, cleared, during, excavation, in, 1978, by, hawass, and, measures, 1, 42, by, 1, 06, metres, 4, 7, by, 3, 5, ft, and, about, 2, metres, 6, 6, ft, deep, lehner, interprets, the, shaft, to, be, an, unfinished, tomb, and, named, it, keyhole, shaft, because, of, cuttings, in, the, ledge, above, the, shaft, that, are, shaped, like, the, lower, part, of, a, traditional, victorian, era, keyhole, upside, down, numerous, ideas, have, been, suggested, to, explain, or, reinterpret, the, origin, and, identity, of, the, sphinx, that, lack, sufficient, evidential, support, and, or, are, contradicted, by, such, and, are, therefore, considered, part, of, pseudohistory, and, pseudoarchaeology, until, the, early, 20th, century, it, was, suggested, that, the, face, of, the, sphinx, had, negroid, characteristics, as, part, of, the, now, outdated, historical, race, concepts
