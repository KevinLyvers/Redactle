through, the, music, dialogue, setting, and, movement, woven, together, more, seamlessly, than, in, previous, musicals, it, ran, for, 572, performances, the, 1920s, also, spawned, a, new, age, of, american, playwright, with, the, emergence, of, eugene, o, neill, whose, plays, beyond, the, horizon, anna, christie, the, hairy, ape, strange, interlude, and, mourning, becomes, electra, proved, that, there, was, an, audience, for, serious, drama, on, broadway, and, o, neill, s, success, paved, the, way, for, major, dramatists, like, elmer, rice, maxwell, anderson, robert, e, sherwood,

the, late, 1960s, marked, a, time, of, cultural, upheaval, all, those, changes, would, prove, painful, for, many, including, those, behind, the, scenes, as, well, as, those, in, the, audience, of,

were, 70, 80, theaters, but, by, 1969, there, were, 36, left, during, this, time, many, broadway, productions, struggled, due, to, low, attendance, rates, which, resulted, in, perceived, mediocrity, among, such, plays, for, this, reason, the, theatre, development, fund, was, created, with, the, purpose, of, assisting, productions, with, high, cultural, value, that, likely, would, struggle, without, subsidization, by, offering, tickets, to, those, plays, to, consumers, at, reduced, prices, in, early, 1982, joe, papp, the, theatrical, producer, and, director, who, established, the,

actors, spending, most, of, their, time, on, the, boards, and, appearing, in, screen, roles, only, secondarily, as, patrick, healy, of, the, new, york, times, noted, broadway, once, had, many, homegrown, stars, who, committed, to, working, on, a, show, for, a, year, as, nathan, lane, has, for, the, addams, family, in, 2010, some, theater, heavyweights, like, mr, lane, were, not, even, nominated, instead, several, tony, awards, were, given, for, productions, that, were, always, intended, to, be, short, timers, on, broadway, given, that, many, of, their, film, star, performers, had, to, move, on, to, other, commitments, according, to, mark, shenton, one, of, the, biggest, changes, to, the, commercial, theatrical, landscape, on, both, sides, of, the, atlantic, over, the, past, decade, or, so, is, that, sightings, of, big, star, names, turning, out, to, do, plays, has, gone, up, but, the, runs, they, are, prepared, to, commit, to, has, gone, down, time, was, that, a,

set, beforehand, but, depends, on, critical, response, word, of, mouth, and, the, effectiveness, of, the, show, s, advertising, all, of, which, determine, ticket, sales, investing, in, a, commercial, production, carries, a, varied, degree, of, financial, risk, shows, need, not, make, a, profit, immediately, should, they, make, their, nut, weekly, operating, expenses, or, lose, money, at, a, rate, acceptable, to, the, producers, they, may, continue, to, run, in, the, expectation, that, eventually, they, will, pay, back, their, initial, costs, and, become, profitable, in, some, borderline, situations, producers, may, ask, that, royalties, be, temporarily, reduced, or, waived, or, even, that, performers, with, the, permission, of, their, unions, take, reduced, salaries, to, prevent, a, show, from, closing, theatre, owners, who, are, not, generally, profit, participants, in, most, productions, may, waive, or, reduce, rents, or, even, lend, money, to, a, show, to, keep, it, running,

production, and, the, beginning, of, another, however, some, shows, with, planned, limited, engagement, runs, may, after, critical, acclaim, or, box, office, success, extend, their, engagements, or, convert, to, open, ended, runs, this, was, the, case, with, 2007, s, august, osage, county, 2009, s, god, of, carnage, 2012, s, newsies, and, 2022, s, take, me, out, historically, musicals, on,

the, criteria, that, define, broadway, theatre, off, broadway, and, off, off, broadway, shows, often, provide, a, more, experimental, challenging, and, intimate, performance, than, is, possible, in, the, larger, broadway, theatres, some, broadway, shows, however, such, as, the, musicals, hair, little, shop, of, horrors, spring, awakening, next, to, normal, rent, avenue, q, in, the, heights, fun,

cities, across, the, country, sometimes, when, a, show, closes, on, broadway, the, entire, production, with, most, if, not, all, of, the, original, cast, intact, is, relaunched, as, a, touring, company, hence, the, name, broadway, national, tour, some, shows, may, even, have, several, touring, companies, out, at, a, time, whether, the, show, is, still, running, in, new, york, or, not, with, many, companies, sitting, down, in, other, major, cities, for, their, own, extended, runs, for, broadway, national, tours, of, top, tier, cities, the, entire, broadway, production, is, transplanted,

tier, and, smaller, cities, can, also, attract, national, tours, but, these, are, more, likely, to, be, bus, and, truck, tours, these, are, scaled, down, versions, of, the, larger, national, touring, productions, historically, acquiring, their, name, because, the, casts, generally, traveled, by, bus, instead, of, by, air, while, the, sets, and, equipment, traveled, by, truck, tours, of, this, type, often, run, for, weeks, rather, than, months, and, frequently, feature, a, reduced, physical, production, to, accommodate, smaller, venues, and, tighter, schedules, and, to, fit, into, fewer, trucks, a, typical, second, tier, city, can, usually, sell, only, up, to, about, eight, shows, one, week, of, tickets, for, cities, smaller, than, that, a, touring, production, might, move, twice, a, week, split, weeks, or, every, day, one, nighters, for, bus, and, truck, tours, the, production, values, are, usually, less, lavish, than, the, typical, broadway, national, tour, or, national, touring, production, and, the, actors, while, still, members, of, the, actors, union, are, compensated, under, a, different, less, lucrative, union, contract, the, touring, broadway, awards,
