the, british, museum, before, the, museum, was, established, bickmore, needed, to, secure, approval, from, boss, tweed, leader, of, the, powerful, and, corrupt, tammany, hall, political, organization,

the, government, of, new, york, city, offered, a, site, next, to, the, amnh, for, consideration, the, commission, rejected, a, conventional, greek, mausoleum, design, instead, opting, to, design, a,
