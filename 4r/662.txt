man, across, the, spider, verse, in, 1962, with, the, success, of, the, fantastic, four, marvel, comics, editor, and, head, writer, stan, lee, was, casting, for, a, new, superhero, idea, he, said, the, idea, for, spider, man, arose, from, a, surge, in, teenage, demand, for, comic, books, and, the, desire, to, create, a, character, with, whom, teens, could, identify, 1, as, with, fantastic, four, lee, saw, spider, man, as, an, opportunity, to, get, out, of, his, system, what, he, felt, was, missing, in, comic, books, in, his, autobiography, lee, cites, the, non, superhuman, pulp, magazine, crime, fighter, the, spider, as, a, great, influence, 130, and, in, a, multitude, of, print, and, video, interviews, lee, stated, he, was, inspired, by, seeing, a, spider, climb, up, a, wall, adding, in, his, autobiography, that, he, has, told, that, story, so, often, he, has, become, unsure, of, whether, or, not, this, is, true, besides, the, name, the, spider, was, wanted, by, both, the, law, and, the, criminal, underworld, a, defining, theme, of, spider, man, s, early, years, and, had, through, years, of, ceaseless, struggle, developed, a, sixth, sense, which, warns, him, of, danger, the, inspiration, for, spider, man, s, spider, sense, although, at, the, time, teenage, superheroes, were, usually, given, names, ending, with, boy, lee, says, he, chose, spider, man, because, he, wanted, the, character, to, age, as, the, series, progressed, and, felt, the, name, spider, boy, would, have, made, the, character, sound, inferior, to, other, superheroes, he, also, decided, to, insert, a, hyphen, in, the, name, as, he, felt, it, looked, too, similar, to, superman, another, superhero, with, a, red, and, blue, costume, that, starts, with, an, s, and, ends, with, man, although, artist, steve, ditko, intended, the, character, to, have, an, orange, and, purple, costume, at, that, time, lee, had, to, get, only, the, consent, of, marvel, publisher, martin, goodman, for, the, character, s, approval, in, a, 1986, interview, lee, described, in, detail, his, arguments, to, overcome, goodman, s, objections, goodman, eventually, agreed, to, a, spider, man, tryout, in, what, lee, in, numerous, interviews, recalled, as, what, would, be, the, final, issue, of, the, science, fiction, and, supernatural, anthology, series, amazing, adult, fantasy, which, was, renamed, amazing, fantasy, for, issue, 15, cover, dated, august, 1962, on, sale, june, 5, 1962, in, particular, lee, stated, that, the, fact, that, it, had, already, been, decided, that, amazing, fantasy, would, be, canceled, after, issue, 15, was, the, only, reason, goodman, allowed, him, to, use, spider, man, while, this, was, the, final, issue, its, editorial, page, anticipated, the, comic, continuing, and, that, the, spider, man, will, appear, every, month, in, amazing, regardless, lee, received, goodman, s, approval, for, the, name, spider, man, and, the, ordinary, teen, concept, and, approached, artist, jack, kirby, as, comics, historian, greg, theakston, recounts, kirby, told, lee, about, an, unpublished, character, on, which, he, had, collaborated, with, joe, simon, in, the, 1950s, in, which, an, orphaned, boy, living, with, an, old, couple, finds, a, magic, ring, that, granted, him, superhuman, powers, lee, and, kirby, immediately, sat, down, for, a, story, conference, theakston, writes, and, lee, afterward, directed, kirby, to, flesh, out, the, character, and, draw, some, pages, steve, ditko, would, be, the, inker, when, kirby, showed, lee, the, first, six, pages, lee, recalled, i, hated, the, way, he, was, doing, it, not, that, he, did, it, badly, it, just, wasn, t, the, character, i, wanted, it, was, too, heroic, 12, lee, turned, to, ditko, who, developed, an, art, style, lee, found, satisfactory, ditko, recalled, one, of, the, first, things, i, did, was, to, work, up, a, costume, a, vital, visual, part, of, the, character, i, had, to, know, how, he, looked, before, i, did, any, breakdowns, for, example, a, clinging, power, so, he, wouldn, t, have, hard, shoes, or, boots, a, hidden, wrist, shooter, versus, a, web, gun, and, holster, etc, i, wasn, t, sure, stan, would, like, the, idea, of, covering, the, character, s, face, but, i, did, it, because, it, hid, an, obviously, boyish, face, it, would, also, add, mystery, to, the, character, although, the, interior, artwork, was, by, ditko, alone, lee, rejected, ditko, s, cover, art, and, commissioned, kirby, to, pencil, a, cover, that, ditko, inked, as, lee, explained, in, 2010, i, think, i, had, jack, sketch, out, a, cover, for, it, because, i, always, had, a, lot, of, confidence, in, jack, s, covers, in, an, early, recollection, of, the, character, s, creation, ditko, described, his, and, lee, s, contributions, in, a, mail, interview, with, gary, martin, published, in, comic, fan, 2, summer, 1965, stan, lee, thought, the, name, up, i, did, costume, web, gimmick, on, wrist, spider, signal, at, the, time, ditko, shared, a, manhattan, studio, with, noted, fetish, artist, eric, stanton, an, art, school, classmate, who, in, a, 1988, interview, with, theakston, recalled, that, although, his, contribution, to, spider, man, was, almost, nil, he, and, ditko, had, worked, on, storyboards, together, and, i, added, a, few, ideas, but, the, whole, thing, was, created, by, steve, on, his, own, i, think, i, added, the, business, about, the, webs, coming, out, of, his, hands, 14, ditko, claimed, in, a, rare, interview, with, jonathan, ross, that, the, costume, was, initially, envisioned, with, an, orange, and, purple, color, scheme, rather, than, the, recognizable, red, and, blue, kirby, disputed, lee, s, version, of, the, story, and, claimed, lee, had, minimal, involvement, in, the, character, s, creation, according, to, kirby, the, idea, for, spider, man, had, originated, with, kirby, and, joe, simon, who, in, the, 1950s, had, developed, a, character, called, the, silver, spider, for, the, crestwood, publications, comic, black, magic, but, the, character, was, left, unused, simon, in, his, 1990, autobiography, disputed, kirby, s, account, asserting, that, black, magic, was, not, a, factor, and, that, simon, devised, the, name, spider, man, later, changed, to, the, silver, spider, while, kirby, outlined, the, character, s, story, and, powers, simon, later, elaborated, that, his, and, kirby, s, character, conception, became, the, basis, for, simon, s, archie, comics, superhero, the, fly, artist, steve, ditko, stated, that, lee, liked, the, name, hawkman, from, dc, comics, and, that, spider, man, was, an, outgrowth, of, that, interest, simon, concurred, that, kirby, had, shown, the, original, spider, man, version, to, lee, who, liked, the, idea, and, assigned, kirby, to, draw, sample, pages, of, the, new, character, but, disliked, the, results, in, simon, s, description, captain, america, with, cobwebs, writer, mark, evanier, notes, that, lee, s, reasoning, that, kirby, s, character, was, too, heroic, seems, unlikely, kirby, still, drew, the, covers, for, amazing, fantasy, 15, and, the, first, issue, of, the, amazing, spider, man, evanier, also, disputes, kirby, s, given, reason, that, he, was, too, busy, to, draw, spider, man, in, addition, to, his, other, duties, since, kirby, was, said, evanier, always, busy, 127, neither, lee, s, nor, kirby, s, explanation, explains, why, key, story, elements, like, the, magic, ring, were, dropped, evanier, states, that, the, most, plausible, explanation, for, the, sudden, change, was, that, goodman, or, one, of, his, assistants, decided, that, spider, man, as, drawn, and, envisioned, by, kirby, was, too, similar, to, the, fly, 127, author, and, ditko, scholar, blake, bell, writes, that, it, was, ditko, who, noted, the, similarities, to, the, fly, ditko, recalled, that, stan, called, jack, about, the, fly, adding, that, ays, later, stan, told, me, i, would, be, penciling, the, story, panel, breakdowns, from, stan, s, synopsis, it, was, at, this, point, that, the, entire, concept, of, the, strip, went, through, a, major, overhaul, out, went, the, magic, ring, adult, spider, man, and, whatever, legend, ideas, that, spider, man, story, would, have, contained, lee, gave, ditko, the, premise, of, a, teenager, bitten, by, a, spider, and, developing, powers, where, ditko, would, expand, upon, to, the, point, he, became, what, bell, describes, as, the, first, work, for, hire, artist, of, his, generation, to, create, and, control, the, narrative, arc, of, his, series, on, the, issue, of, the, initial, creation, ditko, stated, i, still, don, t, know, whose, idea, was, spider, man, ditko, did, however, view, the, published, version, of, spider, man, as, a, separate, creation, to, the, one, he, saw, in, the, five, pencilled, pages, that, kirby, had, completed, to, support, this, ditko, used, the, analogy, of, the, kirby, marvel, thor, which, was, based, on, a, name, or, idea, of, a, character, in, norse, mythology, if, marvel, s, thor, is, a, valid, created, work, by, jack, his, creation, then, why, isn, t, spider, man, by, stan, and, me, valid, created, work, our, creation, kirby, noted, in, a, 1971, interview, that, it, was, ditko, who, got, spider, man, to, roll, and, the, thing, caught, on, because, of, what, he, did, lee, while, claiming, credit, for, the, initial, idea, had, acknowledged, ditko, s, role, stating, if, steve, wants, to, be, called, co, creator, i, think, he, deserves, he, has, further, commented, that, ditko, s, costume, design, was, key, to, the, character, s, success, since, the, costume, completely, covers, spider, man, s, body, people, of, all, races, could, visualize, themselves, inside, the, costume, and, thus, easily, identify, with, the, character, a, few, months, after, spider, man, s, introduction, publisher, goodman, reviewed, the, sales, figures, for, that, issue, and, was, shocked, to, find, it, was, one, of, the, nascent, marvel, s, highest, selling, comics, 97, a, solo, ongoing, series, followed, beginning, with, the, amazing, spider, man, 1, cover, dated, march, 1963, the, title, eventually, became, marvel, s, top, selling, series, 211, with, the, character, swiftly, becoming, a, cultural, icon, a, 1965, esquire, poll, of, college, campuses, found, that, college, students, ranked, spider, man, and, fellow, marvel, hero, the, hulk, alongside, bob, dylan, and, che, guevara, as, their, favorite, revolutionary, icons, one, interviewee, selected, spider, man, because, he, was, beset, by, woes, money, problems, and, the, question, of, existence, in, short, he, is, one, of, us, 223, following, ditko, s, departure, after, issue, 38,
