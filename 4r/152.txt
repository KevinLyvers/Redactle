another, recurring, theme, modern, critics, have, debated, whether, water, margin, is, misogynistic, most, beautiful, women, in, the, novel, are, depicted, as, immoral, and, cruel, and, they, are, often, involved, in, schemes, against, the, protagonists, among, them, is, pan, jinlian, the, sister, in, law, of, wu, song, who, has, later, become, an, archetypal, femme, fatale, and, one, of, the,

just, in, acts, of, revenge, but, also, as, a, way, of, living, noting, that, the, outlaws, celebrated, in, the, novel, were, nevertheless, widely, regarded, as, heroes, and, heroines, over, centuries, educator, william, sin, states, that, one, cannot, divide, the, meanings, of, actions, from, the, cultural, background, under, which, they, performed, and, that, it, would, be, hasty, to, project, concepts, and, values, of, today, onto, the, situation, of, a, distant, culture, where, they, may, not, have, applied, since, fiction, was, not, at, first, a, prestigious, genre, in, the, chinese, literary, world, authorship, of, early, novels, was, often, not, carefully, attributed, and, may, be, unknowable, the, authorship, of, water, margin, is, still, in, some, sense, uncertain, and, the, text, in, any, case, derived, from, many, sources, and, involved, many, editorial, hands, while, the, novel, was, traditionally, attributed, to, shi, nai, an, of, whose, life, nothing, is, reliably, known, recent, scholars, think, that, the, novel, or, portions, of, it, may, have, been, written, or, revised, by, luo, guanzhong, the, author, of, romance, of, the, three, kingdoms, other, contenders, include, shi, hui, and, guo, xun, many, scholars, believe, that, the, first, 70, chapters, were, indeed, written, by, shi, nai, an, however, the, authorship, of, the, final, 30, chapters, is, often, questioned, with, some, speculating, that, it, was, instead, written, by, luo, guanzhong, who, may, have, been, a, student, of, shi, another, theory, which, first, appeared, in, gao, ru, s, baichuan, shuzhi, during, the, ming, dynasty, suggests, that, the, whole, novel, was, written, and, compiled, by, shi, and, then, edited, by, luo, shi, drew, from, oral, and, written, texts, that, had, accumulated, over, time, stories, of, the, liangshan, outlaws, first, appeared, in, old, incidents, in, the, xuanhe, period, of, the, great, song, dynasty, and, had, been, circulating, since, the, southern, song, dynasty, while, folk, tales, and, opera, related, to, water, margin, have, already, existed, long, before, the, novel, itself, came, into, existence, this, theory, suggests, that, shi, nai, an, gathered, and, compiled, these, pieces, of, information, to, write, water, margin, some, believe, that, water, margin, was, written, entirely, by, luo, guanzhong, wang, daokun, who, lived, during, the, reign, of, the, jiajing, emperor, in, the, ming, dynasty, first, mentioned, in, classification, of, water, margin, that, someone, with, the, family, name, luo, who, was, a, native, of, wuyue, yue, a, reference, to, the, southern, china, region, covering, zhejiang, wrote, the, 100, chapter, novel, several, scholars, from, the, ming, and, qing, dynasties, after, wang, daokun, s, time, also, said, that, luo, was, the, author, of, water, margin, during, the, early, republican, era, lu, xun, and, yu, pingbo, suggested, that, the, simplified, edition, of, water, margin, was, written, by, luo, while, the, traditional, version, was, by, shi, nai, an, however, huikang, yesou, in, shi, yu, disagree, with, wang, daokun, s, view, on, the, grounds, that, there, were, significant, differences, between, water, margin, and, romance, of, the, three, kingdoms, therefore, these, two, novels, could, not, have, been, written, by, the, same, person, hu, shih, felt, that, the, draft, of, water, margin, was, done, by, luo, guanzhong, and, could, have, contained, the, chapters, on, the, outlaws, campaigns, against, tian, hu, wang, qing, and, fang, la, but, not, invaders, from, the, liao, dynasty, another, theory, states, that, luo, guanzhong, was, from, the, southern, song, period, vice, the, ming, dynasty, cheng, muheng, suggested, in, notes, on, water, margin, that, luo, lived, in, the, late, southern, song, dynasty, and, early, yuan, era, huang, lin, gen, pointed, out, that, the, name, of, one, of, the, compilers, of, anecdotes, of, jingkang, was, nai, an, and, suggested, that, this, nai, an, who, lived, during, the, southern, song, dynasty, was, shi, nai, an, he, also, felt, that, shi, wrote, a, simplified, version, of, water, margin, which, is, not, the, current, edition, another, candidate, is, shi, hui, a, nanxi, southern, opera, playwright, who, lived, between, the, late, yuan, dynasty, and, early, ming, dynasty, xu, fuzuo, of, the, ming, dynasty, mentioned, in, sanjia, cunlao, weitan, that, junmei, shi, hui, s, courtesy, name, s, intention, in, writing, water, margin, was, to, entertain, people, and, not, to, convey, any, message, during, the, qing, dynasty, shi, hui, and, shi, nai, an, were, linked, suggesting, that, they, are, actually, the, same, person, an, unnamed, writer, wrote, in, chuanqi, huikao, biaomu, that, shi, nai, an, s, given, name, was, actually, hui, courtesy, name, juncheng, and, he, was, a, native, of, hangzhou, sun, kaidi, also, wrote, in, bibliography, of, chinese, popular, fiction, that, nai, an, was, shi, hui, s, pseudonym, later, studies, revealed, that, water, margin, contained, lines, in, the, jiangsu, and, zhejiang, variety, of, chinese, and, that, you, gui, ji, a, work, of, shi, hui, bore, some, resemblance, to, water, margin, hence, the, theory, that, water, margin, was, authored, by, shi, hui, early, scholars, attributed, the, authorship, to, guo, xun, a, politician, who, lived, in, the, ming, dynasty, shen, defu, a, late, ming, dynasty, scholar, mentioned, in, wanli, yehuo, bian, that, guo, wrote, water, margin, shen, guoyuan, added, in, huangming, congxin, lu, that, guo, mimicked, the, writing, styles, of, romance, of, the, three, kingdoms, and, water, margin, to, write, guochao, yinglie, ji, qian, xiyan, also, stated, in, xi, gu, that, guo, edited, water, margin, before, hu, shih, countered, in, his, research, on, water, margin, that, guo, xun, s, name, was, used, as, a, disguise, for, the, real, author, of, water, margin, dai, bufan, had, a, differing, view, as, he, suspected, that, guo, wrote, water, margin, and, then, used, shi, nai, an, to, conceal, his, identity, as, the, author, of, the, novel, the, textual, history, of, the, novel, is, extraordinarily, complex, for, there, are, early, editions, of, varying, lengths, different, parts, and, variations, the, scholar, scott, gregory, comments, that, the, text, could, be, freely, altered, by, later, editors, and, publishers, who, also, could, add, prefaces, or, commentaries, not, until, the, early, 20th, century, were, there, studies, which, began, to, set, these, questions, in, order, and,
