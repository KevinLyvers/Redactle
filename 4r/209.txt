procession, leaves, the, church, however, dimmesdale, climbs, upon, the, scaffold, confesses, his, sin, and, dies, in, hester, s, arms, later, most, witnesses, swear, that, they, saw, a, stigma, in, the, form, of, a, scarlet, a, upon, his, chest, although, some, deny, this, statement, chillingworth, loses, his, vengeance, and, dies, within, a, year, leaving, pearl, a, substantial, inheritance,

wearing, the, scarlet, letter, when, she, dies, she, is, buried, near, the, grave, of, dimmesdale, and, they, share, a, simple, slate, tombstone, engraved, with, an, epitaph, described, as, on, a, field, sable, the, letter, a, gules, on, a, black, background, the, letter, a, in, red, elmer, kennedy, andrews, remarks, that, hawthorne, in, the, custom, house, sets, the, context, for, his, story, and, tells, us, about, romance, which, is, his, preferred, generic, term, to, describe, the, scarlet, letter, as, his, subtitle, for, the, book, a, romance, would, indicate, in, this, introduction, hawthorne, describes, a, space, between, materialism, and, dreaminess, that, he, calls, a, neutral, territory, somewhere, between, the, real, world, and, fairy, land, where, the, actual, and, the, imaginary, may, meet, and, each, imbues, itself, with, nature, of, the, other, this, combination, of, dreaminess, and, realism, gave, the, author, space, to, explore, major, themes, the, experience, of, prynne, and, dimmesdale, recalls, the, story, of, adam, and, eve, because, in, both, cases, sin, results, in, expulsion, and, suffering, but, it, also, results, in, knowledge, specifically, in, knowledge, of, what, it, means, to, be, immoral, for, prynne, the, scarlet, letter, is, a, physical, manifestation, of, her, sin, and, reminder, of, her, painful, solitude, she, contemplates, casting, it, off, to, obtain, her, freedom, from, an, oppressive, society, and, a, checkered, past, as, well, as, the, absence, of, god, because, the, society, excludes, her, she, considers, the, possibility, that, many, of, the, traditions, upheld, by, the, puritan, culture, are, untrue, and, are, not, designed, to, bring, her, happiness, as, for, dimmesdale, the, cheating, minister, his, sin, gives, him, sympathies, so, intimate, with, the, sinful, brotherhood, of, mankind, that, his, chest, vibrate, in, unison, with, theirs, his, eloquent, and, powerful, sermons, derive, from, this, sense, of, empathy, the, dimmesdale, narrative, is, quite, in, keeping, with, the, oldest, and, most, fully, authorized, principles, in, christian, thought, his, fall, is, a, descent, from, apparent, grace, to, his, own, damnation, he, appears, to, begin, in, purity, but, he, ends, in, corruption, the, subtlety, is, that, the, minister, s, belief, is, his, own, cheating, convincing, himself, at, every, stage, of, his, spiritual, pilgrimage, that, he, is, saved, throughout, the, work, the, nature, images, contrast, with, the, stark, darkness, of, the, puritans, and, their, systems, a, rose, bush, s, beauty, forms, a, striking, contrast, to, all, that, surrounds, it, later, the, beautifully, embroidered, scarlet, a, is, held, out, in, part, as, an, invitation, to, find, some, sweet, moral, blossom, in, the, ensuing, tragic, tale, and, in, part, as, an, image, that, the, deep, heart, of, nature, perhaps, god, may, look, more, kindly, on, the, errant, prynne, and, her, child, than, her, puritan, neighbors, do, chillingworth, s, misshapen, body, reflects, or, symbolizes, the, anger, in, his, soul, just, as, dimmesdale, s, illness, reveals, his, inner, turmoil, the, outward, man, reflects, the, condition, of, the, heart, this, observation, is, thought, to, have, been, inspired, by, the, deterioration, of, edgar, allan, poe, whom, hawthorne, much, admired, another, theme, is, the, extreme, legalism, of, the, puritans, and, how, prynne, chose, not, to, conform, to, their, rules, and, beliefs, prynne, was, rejected, by, the, villagers, even, though, she, spent, her, life, doing, what, she, could, to, help, the, sick, and, the, poor, because, she, was, shunned, she, spent, her, life, mostly, in, solitude, and, did, not, attend, church, instead, she, retreated, into, her, own, mind, and, her, own, thinking, her, thoughts, began, to, stretch, and, go, beyond, what, would, be, considered, by, the, puritans, as, safe, she, still, saw, her, sin, but, she, began, to, look, on, it, differently, than, the, villagers, did, prynne, began, to, believe, that, a, person, s, earthly, sins, do, not, necessarily, condemn, them, she, even, went, so, far, as, to, tell, dimmesdale, that, their, sin, had, been, paid, for, by, their, daily, penance, and, that, their, sin, would, not, prevent, them, from, reaching, heaven, prynne, was, alienated, from, puritan, society, both, in, her, physical, life, and, spiritual, life, when, dimmesdale, died, she, knew, she, had, to, move, on, because, she, could, no, longer, conform, to, the, puritans, strictness, her, thinking, was, free, from, puritan, religious, bounds, and, she, had, established, her, own, moral, standards, and, beliefs, it, was, long, held, that, hawthorne, originally, planned, the, scarlet, letter, to, be, a, shorter, novelette, part, of, a, collection, named, old, time, legends, and, that, his, publisher, james, t, fields, convinced, him, to, expand, the, work, to, a, full, length, novel, this, is, not, true, fields, persuaded, hawthorne, to, publish, the, scarlet, letter, alone, along, with, the, earlier, completed, custom, house, essay, but, he, had, nothing, to, do, with, the, length, of, the, story, hawthorne, s, wife, sophia, later, challenged, fields, claims, a, little, inexactly, he, has, made, the, absurd, boast, that, he, was, the, sole, cause, of, the, scarlet, letter, being, published, she, noted, that, her, husband, s, friend, edwin, percy, whipple, a, critic, approached, fields, to, consider, its, publication, the, manuscript, was, written, at, the, peter, edgerley, house, in, salem, massachusetts, still, standing, as, a, private, residence, at, 14, mall, street, it, was, the, last, salem, home, where, the, hawthorne, family, lived, the, scarlet, letter, was, first, published, in, the, spring, of, 1850, by, ticknor, and, fields, beginning, hawthorne, s, most, lucrative, period, when, he, delivered, the, final, pages, to, fields, in, february, 1850, hawthorne, said, that, some, portions, of, the, book, are, powerfully, written, but, doubted, it, would, be, popular, in, fact, the, book, was, an, instant, best, seller, though, over, fourteen, years, it, brought, its, author, only, 1, 500, its, initial, publication, brought, wide, protest, from, natives, of, salem, who, did, not, approve, of, how, hawthorne, had, depicted, them, in, his, introduction, the, custom, house, a, 2, 500, copy, second, edition, included, a, preface, by, hawthorne, dated, march, 30, 1850, that, stated, he, had, decided, to, reprint, his, introduction, without, the, change, of, a, word, the, only, remarkable, features, of, the, sketch, are, its, frank, and, genuine, good, humor, as, to, enmity, or, ill, feeling, of, any, kind, personal, or, political, he, utterly, disclaims, such, motives, the, scarlet, letter, was, also, one, of, the, first, mass, produced, books, in, america, in, the, mid, nineteenth, century, bookbinders, of, home,
