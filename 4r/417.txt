la, traviata, italian, pronunciation, the, fallen, woman, is, an, opera, in, three, acts, by, giuseppe, verdi, set, to, an, italian, libretto, by, francesco, maria, piave, it, is, based, on, la, dame, aux, cam, lias, 1852, a, play, by, alexandre, dumas, fils, which, he, adapted, from, his, own, 1848, novel, the, opera, was, originally, titled, violetta, after, the, main, character, it, was, first, performed, on, 6, march, 1853, at, la, fenice, opera, house, in, venice, piave, and, verdi, wanted, to, follow, dumas, in, giving, the, opera, a, contemporary, setting, but, the, authorities, at, la, fenice, insisted, that, it, be, set, in, the, past, c, 1700, it, was, not, until, the, 1880s, that, the, composer, s, and, librettist, s, original, wishes, were, carried, out, and, realistic, productions, were, staged, la, traviata, has, become, immensely, popular, and, is, among, the, most, frequently, performed, of, all, operas, for, verdi, the, years, 1851, to, 1853, were, filled, with, operatic, activity, first, he, had, agreed, with, the, librettist, salvadore, cammarano, on, a, subject, for, what, would, become, il, trovatore, but, work, on, this, opera, could, not, proceed, while, the, composer, was, writing, rigoletto, which, premiered, in, venice, in, march, 1851, in, addition, personal, affairs, in, his, home, town, limited, his, activities, that, spring, but, after, rigoletto, s, success, in, venice, an, additional, commission, was, offered, by, brenna, the, secretary, of, la, fenice, verdi, and, giuseppina, strepponi, visited, paris, from, late, 1851, and, into, march, 1852, in, february, the, couple, attended, a, performance, of, alexander, dumas, fils, s, the, lady, of, the, camellias, as, a, result, of, this, verdi, s, biographer, mary, jane, phillips, matz, reports, the, composer, immediately, began, to, compose, music, for, what, would, later, become, la, traviata, however, julian, budden, notes, that, verdi, had, probably, read, the, dumas, novel, some, time, before, and, after, seeing, the, play, and, returning, to, italy, he, was, already, setting, up, an, ideal, operatic, cast, for, it, in, his, mind, shown, by, his, dealings, with, la, fenice, francesco, maria, piave, was, engaged, to, write, the, new, libretto, and, the, two, men, tried, to, come, up, with, a, suitable, subject, but, the, composer, complained, that, his, librettist, had, not, yet, offered, him, an, original, or, provocative, idea, writing, to, piave, he, added, that, i, don, t, want, any, of, those, everyday, subjects, that, one, can, find, by, the, hundreds, but, at, the, same, time, the, composer, expressed, concern, about, censorship, in, venice, something, with, which, he, was, very, familiar, after, his, dealings, with, the, censors, concerning, rigoletto, as, the, months, dragged, on, into, october, it, was, agreed, that, piave, would, come, to, sant, agata, verdi, s, home, near, busseto, and, work, with, the, composer, one, subject, was, chosen, piave, set, to, work, and, then, verdi, threw, in, another, idea, which, may, have, been, la, traviata, within, a, short, time, a, synopsis, was, dispatched, to, venice, under, the, title, of, amore, e, morte, love, and, death, however, verdi, wrote, to, his, friend, de, sanctis, telling, him, that, for, venice, i, m, doing, la, dame, aux, cam, lias, which, will, probably, be, called, la, traviata, a, subject, for, our, own, age, although, still, bogged, down, at, sant, agata, piave, was, sanguine, everything, will, turn, out, fine, and, we, ll, have, a, new, masterpiece, from, this, true, wizard, of, modern, harmonies, when, back, at, sant, agata, in, late, january, 1853, verdi, was, reminded, that, his, contract, called, for, him, to, be, in, venice, within, a, week, or, two, and, for, the, premiere, to, be, held, on, the, first, saturday, in, march, 1853, however, it, soon, became, clear, that, a, modern, dress, staging, of, the, new, opera, was, impossible, the, requirement, was, that, it, should, be, set, in, the, 17th, century, in, the, era, of, richelieu, and, reports, from, the, opening, of, the, season, confirmed, the, limitations, of, the, chosen, soprano, the, 38, year, old, fanny, salvini, donatelli, for, taking, the, role, of, violetta, verdi, was, distraught, for, he, held, on, to, the, notion, that, the, opera, could, be, staged, in, modern, dress, as, stiffelio, had, been, done, piave, was, sent, back, to, sant, agata, to, no, avail, he, could, not, persuade, the, composer, to, back, down, on, his, insistence, that, another, soprano, be, secured, yet, the, 15, january, deadline, for, securing, one, had, come, and, gone, verdi, was, filled, with, premonitions, of, disaster, upon, his, arrival, in, venice, on, 21, february, for, rehearsals, and, he, made, his, unhappiness, clear, to, the, singers, the, audience, jeered, at, times, during, the, premiere, directing, some, of, their, scorn, at, the, casting, of, soprano, fanny, salvini, donatelli, in, the, lead, role, of, violetta, though, she, was, an, acclaimed, singer, they, considered, her, to, be, too, old, at, 38, and, overweight, to, credibly, play, a, young, woman, dying, of, consumption, verdi, had, previously, attempted, to, persuade, the, manager, of, la, fenice, to, re, cast, the, role, with, a, younger, woman, but, with, no, success, nevertheless, the, first, act, was, met, with, applause, and, cheering, at, the, end, but, in, the, second, act, the, audience, began, to, turn, against, the, performance, especially, after, the, singing, of, the, baritone, felice, varesi, and, the, tenor, lodovico, graziani, the, next, day, verdi, wrote, to, his, friend, emanuele, muzio, in, what, has, now, become, perhaps, his, most, famous, letter, la, traviata, last, night, a, failure, was, the, fault, mine, or, the, singers, time, will, tell, coincidentally, as, philips, matz, points, out, an, italian, translation, of, the, play, la, dame, aux, cam, lias, was, being, presented, just, a, short, distance, from, la, fenice, while, there, were, demands, for, productions, from, impresarios, in, various, italian, cities, verdi, was, loath, to, allow, them, unless, he, could, be, sure, of, the, strength, of, the, singers, and, in, spite, of, their, pleas, the, composer, refused, as, budden, notes, it, came, to, be, venice, that, made, an, honest, woman, of, violetta, when, verdi, allowed, a, performance, at, the, teatro, san, benedetto, some, revisions, took, place, between, 1853, and, may, 1854, mostly, affecting, acts, 2, and, 3, but, the, opera, was, performed, again, on, 6, may, 1854, and, was, a, great, success, largely, due, to, maria, spezia, aldighieri, s, portrayal, of, violetta, then, it, was, a, fiasco, now, it, has, created, a, furore, draw, your, own, conclusions, reported, piave, who, had, overseen, the, production, in, verdi, s, absence, the, opera, in, the, revised, version, was, first, performed, in, madrid, on, 1, february, 1855, with, spezia, aldighieri, at, teatro, real, in, vienna, on, 4, may, 1855, in, italian, and, in, barcelona, on, 25, october, at, gran, teatre, del, liceu, it, was,

their, best, to, put, an, injunction, upon, performance, the, queen, refrained, from, visiting, the, theatre, during, the, performances, though, the, music, words, and, all, were, not, unheard, at, the, palace, it, was, first, performed, in, the, united, states, by, the, max, maretzek, italian, opera, company, on, 3, december, 1856, in, italian, at, the, academy, of, music, in, new, york, george, templeton, strong, noted, in, his, diary, people, say, the, plot, s, immoral, but, i, don, t, see, that, it, s, so, much, worse, than, many, others, not, to, speak, of, don, giovanni, which, as, put, on, the, stage, is, little, but, rampant, lechery, while, the, evening, post, critic, wrote, those, who, have, quietly, sat, through, the, glaring, improprieties, of, don, giovanni, will, hardly, blush, or, frown, at, anything, in, la, traviata, the, opera, was, first, performed, in, france, on, 6, december, 1856, in, italian, by, the, th, tre, italien, at, the, salle, ventadour, in,
