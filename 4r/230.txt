inspiration, in, business, politics, sports, and, esports, and, its, usage, has, extended, to, film, and, television, the, art, of, war, is, traditionally, attributed, to, an, ancient, chinese, military, general, known, as, sun, tzu, meaning, master, sun, sun, tzu, is, usually, linked, with, existing, in, the, 6th, century, bc, the, earliest, sections, of, the, art, of, war, however, most, likely, date, to, at, least, 100, years, after, him, sima, qian, s, records, of, the, grand, historian, the, first, of, china, s, 24, dynastic, histories, records, an, early, chinese, tradition, that, a, text, on, military, matters, was, written, by, one, sun, wu, from, the, state, of, qi, and, that, this, text, had, been, read, and, studied, by, king, hel, of, wu, r, 514, bc, 495, bc, this, text, was, traditionally, identified, with, the, received, master, sun, s, art, of, war, the, conventional, view, was, that, sun, wu, was, a, military, theorist, from, the, end, of, the, spring, and, autumn, period, 776, 471, bc, who, fled, his, home, state, of, qi, to, the, southeastern, kingdom, of, wu, where, he, is, said, to, have, impressed, the, king, with, his, ability, to, quickly, train, even, court, women, in, military, discipline, and, to, have, made, wu, s, armies, powerful, enough, to, challenge, their, western, rivals, in, the, state, of, chu, this, view, is, still, widely, held, in, china, the, strategist, poet, and, warlord, cao, cao, in, the, early, 3rd, century, ad, authored, the, earliest, known, commentary, to, the, art, of, war, cao, s, preface, makes, clear, that, he, edited, the, text, and, removed, certain, passages, but, the, extent, of, his, changes, were, unclear, historically, the, art, of, war, appears, throughout, the, bibliographical, catalogs, of, the, chinese, dynastic, histories, but, listings, of, its, divisions, and, size, varied, widely, beginning, around, the, 12th, century, sun, tzu, s, historical, existence, began, to, be, questioned, by, chinese, scholars, primarily, on, the, grounds, that, he, is, not, mentioned, in, the, historical, classic, the, commentary, of, zuo, zuo, zhuan, which, mentions, most, of, the, notable, figures, from, the, spring, and, autumn, period, the, name, sun, wu, does, not, appear, in, any, text, prior, to, the, records, of, the, grand, historian, and, has, been, suspected, to, be, a, made, up, descriptive, cognomen, meaning, the, fugitive, warrior, glossing, the, surname, sun, as, the, related, term, fugitive, x, n, while, wu, w, is, 1, the, ancient, chinese, virtue, of, martial, valiant, and, 2, a, jianghuai, dialectal, synonym, of, sh, knight, which, corresponds, to, sunzi, s, role, as, the, hero, s, doppelg, nger, in, the, story, of, wu, zixu, in, the, early, 20th, century, the, chinese, writer, and, reformer, liang, qichao, theorized, that, the, text, was, actually, written, in, the, 4th, century, bc, by, sun, tzu, s, purported, descendant, sun, bin, as, a, number, of, historical, sources, mention, a, military, treatise, he, wrote, unlike, sun, wu, sun, bin, appears, to, have, been, an, actual, person, who, was, a, genuine, authority, on, military, matters, and, may, have, been, the, inspiration, for, the, creation, of, the, historical, figure, sun, tzu, through, a, form, of, euhemerism, in, 1972, the, yinqueshan, han, slips, were, discovered, in, two, han, dynasty, 206, bc, 220, ad, tombs, near, the, city, of, linyi, in, shandong, province, among, the, many, bamboo, slip, writings, contained, in, the, tombs, which, had, been, sealed, between, 134, and, 118, bc, respectively, were, two, separate, texts, one, attributed, to, sun, tzu, corresponding, to, the, received, text, and, another, attributed, to, sun, bin, which, explains, and, expands, upon, the, earlier, the, art, of, war, by, sunzi, the, sun, bin, text, s, material, overlaps, with, much, of, the, sun, tzu, text, and, the, two, may, be, a, single, continuously, developing, intellectual, tradition, united, under, the, sun, name, this, discovery, showed, that, much, of, the, historical, confusion, was, due, to, the, fact, that, there, were, two, texts, that, could, have, been,
