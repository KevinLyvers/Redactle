experience, i, shall, never, forget, the, first, five, minutes, of, jolson, his, velocity, the, amazing, fluidity, with, which, he, shifted, from, a, tremendous, absorption, in, his, audience, to, a, tremendous, absorption, in, his, song, he, explained, that, he, had, seen, emotional, intensity, like, jolson, s, only, among, synagogue, cantors, a, few, years, later, pursuing, a, professional, literary, career, raphaelson, wrote, the, day, of, atonement, a, short, story, about, a, young, jew, named, jakie, rabinowitz, based, on, jolson, s, real, life, the, story, was, published, in, january, 1922, in, everybody, s, magazine, raphaelson, later, adapted, the, story, into, a, stage, play, the, jazz, singer, a, straight, drama, all, the, singing, in, raphaelson, s, version, takes, place, offstage, with, george, jessel, in, the, lead, role, the, show, premiered, at, the, warner, theatre, in, times, square, in, september, 1925, and, became, a, hit, warner, bros, acquired, the, movie, rights, to, the, play, on, june, 4, 1926, and, signed, jessel, to, a, contract, the, moving, picture, world, published, a, story, in, february, 1927, announcing, that, production, on, the, film, would, begin, with, jessel, on, may, 1, but, the, plans, to, make, the, film, with, jessel, would, fall, through, for, multiple, reasons, jessel, s, contract, with, warner, bros, had, not, anticipated, that, the, movie, they, had, particularly, signed, him, for, would, be, made, with, sound, he, d, made, a, modestly, budgeted, silent, comedy, in, the, interim, when, warner, had, hits, with, two, vitaphone, though, dialogue, less, features, in, late, 1926, the, jazz, singer, production, had, been, reconceived, jessel, asked, for, a, bonus, or, a, new, contract, but, was, rebuffed, according, to, jessel, s, description, in, his, autobiography, harry, warner, was, having, a, tough, time, with, the, financing, of, the, company, he, talked, about, taking, care, of, me, if, the, picture, was, a, success, i, did, not, feel, that, was, enough, in, fact, around, the, beginning, of, 1927, harry, warner, the, eldest, of, the, brothers, who, ran, the, eponymous, studio, had, sold, 4, million, of, his, personal, stock, to, keep, the, studio, solvent, then, came, another, major, issue, according, to, jessel, a, first, read, of, screenwriter, alfred, a, cohn, s, adaptation, threw, me, into, a, fit, instead, of, the, boy, s, leaving, the, theatre, and, following, the, traditions, of, his, father, by, singing, in, the, synagogue, as, in, the, play, the, picture, scenario, had, him, return, to, the, winter, garden, as, a, blackface, comedian, with, his, mother, wildly, applauding, in, the, box, i, raised, hell, money, or, no, money, i, would, not, do, this, according, to, performer, eddie, cantor, as, negotiations, between, warner, bros, and, jessel, floundered, jack, l, warner, and, the, studio, s, production, chief, darryl, zanuck, called, to, see, if, he, was, interested, in, the, part, cantor, a, friend, of, jessel, s, responded, that, he, was, sure, any, differences, with, the, actor, could, be, worked, out, and, offered, his, assistance, cantor, was, not, invited, to, participate, in, the, jessel, talks, instead, the, role, was, then, offered, to, jolson, who, had, inspired, it, in, the, first, place, describing, jolson, as, the, production, s, best, choice, for, its, star, film, historian, donald, crafton, wrote, the, entertainer, who, sang, jazzed, up, minstrel, numbers, in, blackface, was, at, the, height, of, his, phenomenal, popularity, anticipating, the, later, stardom, of, crooners, and, rock, stars, jolson, electrified, audiences, with, the, vitality, and, sex, appeal, of, his, songs, and, gestures, which, owed, much, to, black, american, sources, as, described, by, film, historian, robert, l, carringer, jessel, was, a, vaudeville, comedian, and, master, of, ceremonies, with, one, successful, play, and, one, modestly, successful, film, to, his, credit, jolson, was, a, superstar, jolson, took, the, part, signing, a, 75, 000, contract, on, may, 26, 1927, for, eight, weeks, of, services, beginning, in, july, there, have, been, several, claims, but, no, proof, that, jolson, invested, some, of, his, own, money, in, the, film, jessel, and, jolson, also, friends, did, not, speak, for, some, time, after, on, the, one, hand, jessel, had, been, confiding, his, problems, with, the, warners, to, jolson, on, the, other, jolson, had, signed, with, them, without, telling, jessel, of, his, plans, in, his, autobiography, jessel, wrote, that, in, the, end, jolson, must, not, be, blamed, as, the, warners, had, definitely, decided, that, i, was, out, while, many, earlier, sound, films, had, dialogue, all, were, short, subjects, d, w, griffith, s, feature, dream, street, 1921, was, shown, in, new, york, with, a, single, singing, sequence, and, crowd, noises, using, the, sound, on, disc, system, photokinema, the, film, was, preceded, by, a, program, of, sound, shorts, including, a, sequence, with, griffith, speaking, directly, to, the, audience, but, the, feature, itself, had, no, talking, scenes, on, april, 15, 1923, lee, de, forest, introduced, the, sound, on, film, system, phonofilm, which, had, synchronized, sound, and, dialogue, but, the, sound, quality, was, poor, and, the, films, produced, in, this, process, were, short, films, only, the, first, warner, bros, vitaphone, features, don, juan, premiered, august, 1926, and, the, better, ole, premiered, october, 1926, like, three, more, that, followed, in, early, 1927, when, a, man, loves, old, san, francisco, and, the, first, auto, had, only, a, synchronized, instrumental, score, and, sound, effects, the, jazz, singer, contains, those, as, well, as, numerous, synchronized, singing, sequences, and, some, synchronized, speech, two, popular, tunes, are, performed, by, the, young, jakie, rabinowitz, the, future, jazz, singer, his, father, a, cantor, performs, the, devotional, kol, nidre, the, famous, cantor, yossele, rosenblatt, appearing, as, himself, sings, an, excerpt, of, another, religious, melody, kaddish, and, the, song, yahrzeit, licht, as, the, adult, jack, robin, jolson, performs, six, songs, five, popular, jazz, tunes, and, the, kol, nidre, the, sound, for, the, film, was, recorded, by, british, born, george, groves, who, had, also, worked, on, don, juan, to, direct, the, studio, chose, alan, crosland, who, already, had, two, vitaphone, films, to, his, credit, don, juan, and, old, san, francisco, which, opened, while, the, jazz, singer, was, in, production, jolson, s, first, vocal, performance, about, fifteen, minutes, into, the, picture, is, of, dirty, hands, dirty, face, with, music, by, james, v, monaco, and, lyrics, by, edgar, leslie, and, grant, clarke, the, first, synchronized, speech, uttered, by, jack, to, a, cabaret, crowd, and, to, the, piano, player, in, the, band, that, accompanies, him, occurs, directly, after, that, performance, beginning, at, the, 17, 25, mark, of, the, film, jack, s, first, spoken, words, wait, a, minute, wait, a, minute, you, ain, t, heard, nothin, yet, were, well, established, stage, patter, of, jolson, s, he, had, even, spoken, very, similar, lines, in, an, earlier, short, a, plantation, act, 1926, the, line, had, become, virtually, an, in, joke, in, november, 1918, during, a, gala, concert, celebrating, the, end, of, world, war, i, jolson, ran, onstage, amid, the, applause, for, the, preceding, performer, the, great, operatic, tenor, enrico, caruso, and, exclaimed, folks, you, ain, t, heard, nothin, yet, the, following, year, he, recorded, the, song, you, ain, t, heard, nothin, yet, in, a, later, scene, jack, talks, with, his, mother, played, by, eugenie, besserer, in, the, family, parlor, his, father, enters, and, pronounces, one, very, conclusive, word, stop, the, final, line, of, dialogue, in, the, film, in, total, the, movie, contains, barely, two, minutes, worth, of, synchronized, talking, much, or, all, of, it, improvised, the, rest, of, the, dialogue, is, presented, through, the, caption, cards, or, intertitles, standard, in, silent, movies, of, the, era, as, was, common, those, titles, were, composed, not, by, the, film, s, scenarist, alfred, cohn, but, by, another, writer, in, this, case, jack, jarmuth, while, jolson, was, touring, with, a, stage, show, during, june, 1927, production, on, the, jazz, singer, began, with, the, shooting, of, exterior, scenes, by, the, second, unit, in, late, june, alan, crosland, headed, to, new, york, city, to, shoot, the, lower, east, side, and, winter, garden, exteriors, on, location, jolson, joined, the, production, in, mid, july, his, contract, specified, july, 11, filming, with, jolson, began, with, his, silent, scenes, the, more, complex, vitaphone, sequences, were, primarily, done, in, late, august, both, jolson, and, zanuck, would, later, take, credit, for, thinking, up, the, ad, libbed, dialogue, sequence, between, jack, and, his, mother, another, story, had, it, that, sam, warner, was, impressed, by, jolson, s, brief, ad, libbing, in, the, cabaret, scene, and, had, cohn, come, up, with, some, lines, on, the, spot, on, september, 23, motion, picture, news, reported, that, production, on, the, film, had, been, completed, the, production, cost, for, the, jazz, singer, was, 422, 000, approximately, us, 5, 96, million, in, 2023, dollars, a, large, sum, especially, for, warner, bros, which, rarely, spent, more, than, 250, 000, it, was, by, no, means, a, record, for, the, studio, however, two, features, starring, john, barrymore, had, been, costlier, the, sea, beast, 1926, a, loose, and, entirely, silent, adaptation, of, moby, dick, at, 503, 000, and, don, juan, at, 546, 000, nonetheless, the, outlay, constituted, a, major, gamble, in, light, of, the, studio, s, financial, straits, while, the, jazz, singer, was, in, production, harry, warner, stopped, taking, a, salary, pawned, jewelry, belonging, to, his, wife, and, moved, his, family, into, a, smaller, apartment, the, premiere, occurred, on, october, 6, 1927, at, warner, bros, flagship, theater, in, new, york, city, in, keeping, with, the, film, s, theme, of, a, conflict, within, a, jewish, family, the, film, premiered, after, sunset, on, the, eve, of, the, yom, kippur, holiday, the, buildup, to, the, premiere, was, tense, besides, warner, bros, precarious, financial, position, the, physical, presentation, of, the, film, itself, was, remarkably, complex, each, of, jolson, s, musical, numbers, was, mounted, on, a, separate, reel, with, a, separate, accompanying, sound, disc, even, though, the, film, was, only, eighty, nine, minutes, long, there, were, fifteen, reels, and, fifteen, discs, to, manage, and, the, projectionist, had, to, be, able, to, thread, the, film, and, cue, up, the, vitaphone, records, very, quickly, the, least, stumble, hesitation, or, human, error, would, result, in, public, and, financial, humiliation, for, the, company, none, of, the, four, warner, brothers, were, able, to, attend, sam, warner, among, them, the, strongest, advocate, for, vitaphone, had, died, the, previous, day, of, pneumonia, and, the, surviving, brothers, had, returned, to, california, for, his, funeral, according, to, doris, warner, who, was, in, attendance, about, halfway, through, the, film, she, began, to, feel, that, something, exceptional, was, taking, place, suddenly, jolson, s, face, appeared, in, big, close, up, and, said, wait, a, minute, wait, a, minute, you, ain, t, heard, nothing, yet, jolson, s, wait, a, minute, line, prompted, a, loud, positive, response, from, the, audience, who, were, dumbfounded, by, seeing, and, hearing, someone, speak, on, a, film, for, the, first, time, so, much, so, that, the, double, entendre, was, missed, at, first, applause, followed, each, of, his, songs, excitement, built, and, when, jolson, and, eugenie, besserer, began, their, dialogue, scene, the, audience, became, hysterical, after, the, show, the, audience, turned, into, a, milling, battling, mob, in, one, journalist, s, description, chanting, jolson, jolson, jolson, among, those, who, reviewed, the, film, the, critic, who, foresaw, most, clearly, what, it, presaged, for, the, future, of, cinema, was, life, magazine, s, robert, e, sherwood, he, described, the, spoken, dialogue, scene, between, jolson, and, besserer, as, fraught, with, tremendous, significance, i, for, one, suddenly, realized, that, the, end, of, the, silent, drama, is, in, sight, critical, reaction, was, generally, though, far, from, universally, positive, the, new, york, times, critic, mordaunt, hall, reviewing, the, film, s, premiere, declared, that, not, since, the, first, presentation, of, vitaphone, features, more, than, a, year, ago, i, e, don, juan, has, anything, like, the, ovation, been, heard, in, a, motion, picture, theatre, the, vitaphoned, songs, and, some, dialogue, have, been, introduced, most, adroitly, this, in, itself, is, an, ambitious, move, for, in, the, expression, of, song, the, vitaphone, vitalizes, the, production, enormously, the, dialogue, is, not, so, effective, for, it, does, not, always, catch, the, nuances, of, speech, or, inflections, of, the, voice, so, that, one, is, not, aware, of, the, mechanical, features, variety, called, it, ndoubtedly, the, best, thing, vitaphone, has, ever, put, on, the, screen, abundant, power, and, appeal, richard, watts, jr, of, the, new, york, herald, tribune, called, it, a, pleasantly, sentimental, orgy, dealing, with, a, struggle, between, religion, and, art, his, is, not, essentially, a, motion, picture, but, rather, a, chance, to, capture, for, comparative, immortality, the, sight, and, sound, of, a, great, performer, the, exhibitors, herald, s, take, was, virtually, identical, scarcely, a, motion, picture, it, should, be, more, properly, labeled, an, enlarged, vitaphone, record, of, al, jolson, in, half, a, dozen, songs, the, film, received, favorable, reviews, in, both, the, jewish, press, and, in, african, american, newspapers, such, as, the, baltimore, afro, american, the, new, york, amsterdam, news, and, the, pittsburgh, courier, the, headline, of, the, los, angeles, times, review, told, a, somewhat, different, story, jazz, singer, scores, a, hit, vitaphone, and, al, jolson, responsible, picture, itself, second, rate, photoplay, dismissed, jolson, as, no, movie, actor, without, his, broadway, reputation, he, wouldn, t, rate, as, a, minor, player, the, film, developed, into, a, major, hit, demonstrating, the, profit, potential, of, feature, length, talkies, but, donald, crafton, has, shown, that, the, reputation, the, film, later, acquired, for, being, one, of, hollywood, s, most, enormous, successes, to, date, was, inflated, the, movie, did, well, but, not, astonishingly, so, in, the, major, cities, where, it, was, first, released, garnering, much, of, its, impressive, profits, with, long, steady, runs, in, population, centers, large, and, small, all, around, the, country, as, conversion, of, movie, theaters, to, sound, was, still, in, its, early, stages, the, film, actually, arrived, at, many, of, those, secondary, venues, in, a, silent, version, on, the, other, hand, crafton, s, statement, that, the, jazz, singer, was, in, a, distinct, second, or, third, tier, of, attractions, compared, to, the, most, popular, films, of, the, day, and, even, other, vitaphone, talkies, is, also, incorrect, in, fact, the, film, was, easily, the, biggest, earner, in, warner, bros, history, and, would, remain, so, until, it, was, surpassed, a, year, later, by, the, singing, fool, another, jolson, feature, in, the, larger, scope, of, hollywood, among, films, originally, released, in, 1927, available, evidence, suggests, that, the, jazz, singer, was, among, the, three, biggest, box, office, hits, trailing, only, wings, and, perhaps, the, king, of, kings, according, to, warner, bros, records, the, film, earned, revenues, of, 1, 974, 000, in, the, united, states, and, canada, and, 651, 000, elsewhere, for, a, worldwide, theatrical, gross, rental, of, approximately, 2, 6, million, the, studio, s, share, of, the, box, office, gross, and, a, profit, of, 1, 196, 750, one, of, the, keys, to, the, film, s, success, was, an, innovative, marketing, scheme, conceived, by, sam, morris, warner, bros, sales, manager, in, crafton, s, description, special, clause, in, warners, vitaphone, exhibition, contract, virtually, guaranteed, long, runs, theaters, had, to, book, the, jazz, singer, for, full, rather, than, split, weeks, instead, of, the, traditional, flat, rental, fee, warners, took, a, percentage, of, the, gate, a, sliding, scale, meant, that, the, exhibitor, s, take, increased, the, longer, the, film, was, held, over, the, signing, of, this, contract, by, the, greater, new, york, fox, theatres, circuit, was, regarded, as, a, headline, making, precedent, similar, arrangements, based, on, a, percentage, of, the, gross, rather, than, flat, rental, fees, would, soon, become, standard, for, the, u, s, film, industry, s, high, end, or, a, product, though, in, retrospect, it, is, understood, that, the, success, of, the, jazz, singer, signaled, the, end, of, the, silent, motion, picture, era, this, was, not, immediately, apparent, mordaunt, hall, for, example, praised, warner, bros, for, astutely, realiz, that, a, film, conception, of, the, jazz, singer, was, one, of, the, few, subjects, that, would, lend, itself, to, the, use, of, the, vitaphone, in, historian, richard, koszarski, s, words, silent, films, did, not, disappear, overnight, nor, did, talking, films, immediately, flood, the, theaters, nevertheless, 1927, remains, the, year, that, warner, bros, moved, to, close, the, book, on, the, history, of, silent, pictures, even, if, their, original, goal, had, been, somewhat, more, modest, the, film, had, other, effects, that, were, more, immediate, george, jessel, who, was, in, his, third, season, touring, with, the, stage, production, of, the, jazz, singer, later, described, what, happened, to, his, show, perhaps, anticipating, how, sound, would, soon, cement, hollywood, s, dominance, of, the, american, entertainment, industry, a, week, or, two, after, the, washington, engagement, the, sound, and, picture, version, of, the, jazz, singer, with, al, jolson, was, sweeping, the, country, and, i, was, swept, out, of, business, i, couldn, t, compete, with, a, picture, theatre, across, the, street, showing, the, first, great, sound, picture, in, the, world, for, fifty, cents, while, the, price, at, my, theatre, was, 3, 00, as, the, truly, pivotal, event, crafton, points, to, the, national, release, of, the, film, s, sound, version, in, early, 1928, he, dates, it, to, january, block, and, wilson, to, february, 4, in, march, warners, announced, that, the, jazz, singer, was, playing, at, a, record, 235, theaters, though, many, could, still, show, it, only, silently, in, may, a, consortium, including, the, leading, hollywood, studios, signed, up, with, western, electric, s, licensing, division, erpi, for, sound, conversion, in, july, warner, bros, released, the, first, all, talking, feature, lights, of, new, york, a, musical, crime, melodrama, on, september, 27, the, jazz, singer, became, the, first, feature, length, talking, picture, to, be, shown, in, europe, when, it, premiered, at, london, s, piccadilly, theatre, the, movie, created, a, sensation, according, to, british, film, historian, rachael, low, the, jazz, singer, was, a, turning, point, the, bioscope, greeted, it, with, we, are, inclined, to, wonder, why, we, ever, called, them, living, pictures, the, paris, sound, premiere, followed, in, january, 1929, before, the, 1st, academy, awards, ceremony, was, held, in, may, 1929, honoring, films, released, between, august, 1927, and, july, 1928, the, jazz, singer, was, ruled, ineligible, for, the, two, top, prizes, the, outstanding, picture, production, and, the, unique, and, artistic, production, on, the, basis, that, it, would, have, been, unfair, competition, for, the, silent, pictures, under, consideration, by, mid, 1929, hollywood, was, producing, almost, exclusively, sound, films, by, the, end, of, the, following, year, the, same, was, true, in, much, of, western, europe, jolson, went, on, to, make, a, series, of, movies, for, warners, including, the, singing, fool, a, part, talkie, and, the, all, talking, features, say, it, with, songs, 1929, mammy, 1930, and, big, boy, 1930, jack, robin, s, use, of, blackface, in, his, broadway, stage, act, a, common, practice, at, the, time, which, is, now, widely, condemned, as, racist, is, the, primary, focus, of, many, jazz, singer, studies, its, crucial, and, unusual, role, is, described, by, scholar, corin, willis, in, contrast, to, the, racial, jokes, and, innuendo, brought, out, in, its, subsequent, persistence, in, early, sound, film, blackface, imagery, in, the, jazz, singer, is, at, the, core, of, the, film, s, central, theme, an, expressive, and, artistic, exploration, of, the, notion, of, duplicity, and, ethnic, hybridity, within, american, identity, of, the, more, than, seventy, examples, of, blackface, in, early, sound, film, 1927, 53, that, i, have, viewed, including, the, nine, blackface, appearances, jolson, subsequently, made, the, jazz, singer, is, unique, in, that, it, is, the, only, film, where, blackface, is, central, to, the, narrative, development, and, thematic, expression, the, function, and, meaning, of, blackface, in, the, film, is, intimately, involved, with, jack, s, own, jewish, heritage, and, his, desire, to, make, his, mark, in, mass, american, culture, much, as, the, ethnically, jewish, jolson, and, the, warner, brothers, were, doing, themselves, jack, robin, compounds, both, tradition, and, stardom, the, warner, brothers, thesis, is, that, really, to, succeed, a, man, must, first, acknowledge, his, ethnic, self, argues, w, t, lhamon, he, whole, film, builds, toward, the, blacking, up, scene, at, the, dress, rehearsal, jack, robin, needs, the, blackface, mask, as, the, agency, of, his, compounded, identity, blackface, will, hold, all, the, identities, together, without, freezing, them, in, a, singular, relationship, or, replacing, their, parts, seymour, stark, s, view, is, less, sanguine, in, describing, jolson, s, extensive, experience, performing, in, blackface, in, stage, musicals, he, asserts, the, immigrant, jew, as, broadway, star, works, within, a, blackface, minstrel, tradition, that, obscures, his, jewish, pedigree, but, proclaims, his, white, identity, jolson, s, slight, yiddish, accent, was, hidden, by, a, southern, veneer, arguing, that, the, jazz, singer, actually, avoids, honestly, dealing, with, the, tension, between, american, assimilation, and, jewish, identity, he, claims, that, its, covert, message, is, that, the, symbol, of, blackface, provides, the, jewish, immigrant, with, the, same, rights, and, privileges, accorded, to, earlier, generations, of, european, immigrants, initiated, into, the, rituals, of, the, minstrel, show, lisa, silberman, brenner, contradicts, this, view, she, returns, to, the, intentions, expressed, by, samson, raphaelson, on, whose, play, the, film, s, script, was, closely, based, for, raphaelson, jazz, is, prayer, american, style, and, the, blackface, minstrel, the, new, jewish, cantor, based, on, the, author, s, own, words, the, play, is, about, blackface, as, a, means, for, jews, to, express, a, new, kind, of, jewishness, that, of, the, modern, american, jew, she, observes, that, during, the, same, period, the, jewish, press, was, noting, with, pride, that, jewish, performers, were, adopting, aspects, of, african, american, music, according, to, scott, eyman, the, film, marks, one, of, the, few, times, hollywood, jews, allowed, themselves, to, contemplate, their, own, central, cultural, myth, and, the, conundrums, that, go, with, it, the, jazz, singer, implicitly, celebrates, the, ambition, and, drive, needed, to, escape, the, shtetls, of, europe, and, the, ghettos, of, new, york, city, and, the, attendant, hunger, for, recognition, jack, sam, and, harry, let, jack, robin, have, it, all, the, satisfaction, of, taking, his, father, s, place, and, of, conquering, the, winter, garden, they, were, perhaps, unwittingly, dramatizing, some, of, their, own, ambivalence, about, the, debt, first, generation, americans, owed, their, parents, three, subsequent, screen, versions, of, the, jazz, singer, have, been, produced, a, 1952, remake, starring, danny, thomas, and, peggy, lee, a, 1959, television, remake, starring, jerry, lewis, and, a, 1980, remake, starring, neil, diamond, lucie, arnaz, and, laurence, olivier, the, jazz, singer, was, adapted, as, a, one, hour, radio, play, on, two, broadcasts, of, lux, radio, theatre, both, starring, al, jolson, reprising, his, screen, role, the, first, aired, august, 10, 1936, the, second, also, starring, gail, patrick, on, june, 2, 1947, the, jazz, singer, was, parodied, as, early, as, 1936, in, the, warner, bros, cartoon, i, love, to, singa, directed, by, tex, avery, its, hero, is, owl, jolson, a, young, owl, who, croons, popular, ditties, such, as, the, title, song, against, the, wishes, of, his, father, a, classical, music, teacher, among, the, many, references, to, the, jazz, singer, in, popular, culture, perhaps, the, most, significant, is, that, of, the, mgm, musical, singin, in, the, rain, 1952, the, story, set, in, 1927, revolves, around, efforts, to, change, a, silent, film, production, the, dueling, cavalier, into, a, talking, picture, in, response, to, the, jazz, singer, s, success, at, one, point, donald, o, connor, s, character, suggests, a, new, name, for, the, now, musical, i, ve, got, it, the, dueling, mammy, the, plot, of, the, simpsons, episode, like, father, like, clown, 1991, parallels, the, tale, of, jakie, rabinowitz, jack, robin, krusty, the, clown, s, rabbi, father, disapproves, of, his, son, s, choice, to, be, a, comedian, telling, him, you, have, brought, shame, on, our, family, oh, if, you, were, a, musician, or, a, jazz, singer, this, i, could, forgive, according, to, film, historian, krin, gabbard, the, jazz, singer, provides, the, basic, narrative, for, the, lives, of, jazz, and, popular, musicians, in, the, movies, if, this, argument, means, that, sometime, after, 1959, the, narrative, must, belong, to, pop, rockers, it, only, proves, the, power, of, the, original, 1927, film, to, determine, how, hollywood, tells, the, stories, of, popular, musicians, more, broadly, he, also, suggests, that, this, seemingly, unique, film, has, become, a, paradigm, for, american, success, stories, more, specifically, he, examines, a, cycle, of, biopics, of, white, jazz, musicians, stretching, from, birth, of, the, blues, 1941, to, the, five, pennies, 1959, that, trace, their, roots, to, the, jazz, singer, in, 1996, the, jazz, singer, was, selected, for, preservation, in, the, national, film, registry, of, culturally, historically, or, aesthetically, significant, motion,
