oedipus, rex, also, known, by, its, greek, title, oedipus, tyrannus, ancient, greek, pronounced, or, oedipus, the, king, is, an, athenian, tragedy, by, sophocles, that, was, first, performed, c, 429, bc, originally, to, the, ancient, greeks, the, title, was, simply, oedipus, as, it, is, referred, to, by, aristotle, in, the, poetics, it, is, thought, to, have, been, renamed, oedipus, tyrannus, to, distinguish, it, from, oedipus, at, colonus, a, later, play, by, sophocles, in, antiquity, the, term, tyrant, referred, to, a, ruler, with, no, legitimate, claim, to, rule, but, it, did, not, necessarily, have, a, negative, connotation, of, sophocles, three, theban, plays, that, have, survived, and, that, deal, with, the, story, of, oedipus, oedipus, rex, was, the, second, to, be, written, following, antigone, by, about, a, dozen, years, however, in, terms, of, the, chronology, of, events, described, by, the, plays, it, comes, first, followed, by, oedipus, at, colonus, and, then, antigone, prior, to, the, start, of, oedipus, rex, oedipus, has, become, the, king, of, thebes, while, unwittingly, fulfilling, a, prophecy, that, he, would, kill, his, father, laius, the, previous, king, and, marry, his, mother, jocasta, whom, oedipus, took, as, his, queen, after, solving, the, riddle, of, the, sphinx, the, action, of, sophocles, s, play, concerns, oedipus, s, search, for, the, murderer, of, laius, in, order, to, end, a, plague, ravaging, thebes, unaware, that, the, killer, he, is, looking, for, is, none, other, than, himself, at, the, end, of, the, play, after, the, truth, finally, comes, to, light, jocasta, hangs, herself, while, oedipus, horrified, at, his, patricide, and, incest, proceeds, to, gouge, out, his, own, eyes, in, despair, in, his, poetics, aristotle, refers, several, times, to, the, play, in, order, to, exemplify, aspects, of, the, genre, the, misfortunes, of, thebes, are, believed, to, be, the, result, of, a, curse, laid, upon, laius, for, the, time, he, had, violated, the, sacred, laws, of, hospitality, greek, xenia, in, his, youth, laius, was, taken, in, as, a, guest, by, pelops, king, of, elis, where, he, would, become, tutor, to, the, king, s, youngest, son, chrysippus, in, chariot, racing, apollo, the, protector, of, youth, and, boys, cursed, him, for, raping, pelops, son, chrysippus, committed, suicide, when, laius, son, is, born, he, consults, an, oracle, as, to, his, fortune, to, his, horror, the, oracle, reveals, that, laius, is, doomed, to, perish, by, the, hand, of, his, own, son, laius, binds, the, infant, s, feet, together, with, a, pin, and, orders, jocasta, to, kill, him, unable, to, do, so, to, her, own, son, jocasta, orders, a, servant, to, expose, the, infant, on, a, mountaintop, the, servant, moved, by, pity, gives, the, child, to, a, shepherd, who, unbinds, the, infant, s, ankles, and, names, him, oedipus, swollen, foot, the, shepherd, brings, the, infant, to, corinth, and, presents, him, to, the, childless, king, polybus, who, raises, oedipus, as, his, own, son, as, he, grows, to, manhood, oedipus, hears, a, rumour, that, he, is, not, truly, the, son, of, polybus, and, his, wife, merope, he, asks, the, delphic, oracle, who, his, parents, really, are, the, oracle, seems, to, ignore, this, question, telling, him, instead, that, he, is, destined, to, mate, with, own, mother, and, shed, with, own, hands, the, blood, of, own, sire, desperate, to, avoid, this, terrible, fate, oedipus, who, still, believes, that, polybus, and, merope, are, his, true, parents, leaves, corinth, for, the, city, of, thebes, on, the, road, to, thebes, oedipus, encounters, an, old, man, and, his, servants, the, two, begin, to, quarrel, over, whose, chariot, has, the, right, of, way, while, the, old, man, moves, to, strike, the, insolent, youth, with, his, scepter, oedipus, throws, the, man, down, from, his, chariot, killing, him, thus, the, prophecy, in, which, oedipus, slays, his, own, father, is, fulfilled, as, the, old, man, as, oedipus, discovers, later, was, laius, king, of, thebes, and, true, father, to, oedipus, arriving, at, thebes, a, city, in, turmoil, oedipus, encounters, the, sphinx, a, legendary, beast, with, the, head, and, breasts, of, a, woman, the, body, of, a, lioness, and, the, wings, of, an, eagle, the, sphinx, perched, on, a, hill, was, devouring, thebans, and, travelers, one, by, one, if, they, could, not, solve, her, riddle, the, precise, riddle, asked, by, the, sphinx, varied, in, early, traditions, and, is, not, explicitly, stated, in, oedipus, rex, as, the, event, precedes, the, play, however, according, to, the, most, widely, regarded, version, of, the, riddle, the, sphinx, asks, what, is, the, creature, that, walks, on, four, legs, in, the, morning, two, legs, at, noon, and, three, in, the, evening, oedipus, blessed, with, great, intelligence, answers, correctly, man, greek, anthr, pos, who, crawls, on, all, fours, as, an, infant, walks, upright, in, maturity, and, leans, on, a, stick, in, old, age, 463, bested, by, the, prince, the, sphinx, throws, herself, from, a, cliff, thereby, ending, the, curse, oedipus, reward, for, freeing, thebes, from, the, sphinx, is, kingship, to, the, city, and, the, hand, of, its, dowager, queen, jocasta, none, at, that, point, realize, that, jocasta, is, oedipus, true, mother, thus, unbeknownst, to, either, character, the, remaining, prophecy, has, been, fulfilled, oedipus, king, of, thebes, sends, his, brother, in, law, creon, to, ask, the, advice, of, the, oracle, at, delphi, concerning, a, plague, ravaging, thebes, creon, returns, to, report, that, the, plague, is, the, result, of, religious, pollution, since, the, murderer, of, their, former, king, laius, has, never, been, caught, oedipus, vows, to, find, the, murderer, and, curses, him, for, causing, the, plague, oedipus, summons, the, blind, prophet, tiresias, for, help, tiresias, admits, to, knowing, the, answers, to, oedipus, questions, but, he, refuses, to, speak, instead, telling, oedipus, to, abandon, his, search, angered, by, the, seer, s, reply, oedipus, accuses, him, of, complicity, in, laius, murder, the, offended, tiresias, then, reveals, to, the, king, that, ou, yourself, are, the, criminal, you, seek, oedipus, does, not, understand, how, this, could, be, and, supposes, that, creon, must, have, paid, tiresias, to, accuse, him, the, two, argue, vehemently, as, oedipus, mocks, tiresias, lack, of, sight, and, tiresias, retorts, that, oedipus, himself, is, blind, eventually, the, prophet, leaves, muttering, darkly, that, when, the, murderer, is, discovered, he, shall, be, a, native, of, thebes, brother, and, father, to, his, own, children, and, son, and, husband, to, his, own, mother, creon, arrives, to, face, oedipus, s, accusations, the, king, demands, that, creon, be, executed, however, the, chorus, persuades, him, to, let, creon, live, jocasta, wife, of, first, laius, and, then, oedipus, enters, and, attempts, to, comfort, oedipus, telling, him, he, should, take, no, notice, of, prophets, as, proof, she, recounts, an, incident, in, which, she, and, laius, received, an, oracle, which, never, came, true, the, prophecy, stated, that, laius, would, be, killed, by, his, own, son, instead, laius, was, killed, by, bandits, at, a, fork, in, the, road, triplais, amaxitois, the, mention, of, the, place, causes, oedipus, to, pause, and, ask, for, more, details, jocasta, specifies, the, branch, to, daulis, on, the, way, to, delphi, recalling, tiresias, words, he, asks, jocasta, to, describe, laius, the, king, then, sends, for, a, shepherd, the, only, surviving, witness, of, the, attack, to, be, brought, from, his, fields, to, the, palace, confused, jocasta, asks, oedipus, what, the, matter, is, and, he, tells, her, many, years, ago, at, a, banquet, in, corinth, a, man, drunkenly, accused, oedipus, of, not, being, his, father, s, son, oedipus, went, to, delphi, and, asked, the, oracle, about, his, parentage, instead, of, answering, his, question, directly, the, oracle, prophesied, that, he, would, one, day, murder, his, father, and, sleep, with, his, mother, upon, hearing, this, oedipus, resolved, never, to, return, to, corinth, in, his, travels, he, came, to, the, very, crossroads, where, laius, had, been, killed, and, encountered, a, carriage, that, attempted, to, drive, him, off, the, road, an, argument, ensued, and, oedipus, killed, the, travelers, including, a, man, who, matched, jocasta, s, description, of, laius, however, oedipus, holds, out, hope, that, he, was, not, laius, killer, because, laius, was, said, to, have, been, murdered, by, several, robbers, if, the, shepherd, confirms, that, laius, was, attacked, by, many, men, then, oedipus, will, be, in, the, clear, a, man, arrives, from, corinth, with, the, message, that, polybus, who, raised, oedipus, as, his, son, has, died, to, the, surprise, of, the, messenger, oedipus, is, overjoyed, because, he, can, no, longer, kill, his, father, thus, disproving, half, of, the, oracle, s, prophecy, however, he, still, fears, that, he, might, somehow, commit, incest, with, his, mother, eager, to, set, the, king, s, mind, at, ease, the, messenger, tells, him, not, to, worry, because, merope, is, not, his, real, mother, the, messenger, explains, that, years, earlier, while, tending, his, flock, on, mount, cithaeron, a, shepherd, from, the, household, of, laius, brought, him, an, infant, that, he, was, instructed, to, dispose, of, the, messenger, had, then, given, the, child, to, polybus, who, raised, him, oedipus, asks, the, chorus, if, anyone, knows, the, identity, of, the, other, shepherd, or, where, he, might, be, now, they, respond, that, he, is, the, same, shepherd, who, witnessed, the, murder, of, laius, and, whom, oedipus, had, already, sent, for, jocasta, realizing, the, truth, desperately, begs, oedipus, to, stop, asking, questions, when, oedipus, refuses, the, queen, runs, into, the, palace, when, the, shepherd, arrives, oedipus, questions, him, but, he, begs, to, be, allowed, to, leave, without, answering, further, however, oedipus, presses, him, finally, threatening, him, with, torture, or, execution, it, emerges, that, the, child, he, gave, away, was, laius, own, son, in, fear, of, a, prophecy, that, the, child, would, kill, his, father, jocasta, gave, her, son, to, the, shepherd, in, order, to, be, exposed, upon, the, mountainside, everything, is, at, last, revealed, and, oedipus, curses, himself, and, fate, before, leaving, the, stage, the, chorus, laments, how, even, a, great, man, can, be, felled, by, fate, and, following, this, a, servant, exits, the, palace, to, speak, of, what, has, happened, inside, jocasta, has, hanged, herself, in, her, bedchamber, entering, the, palace, in, anguish, oedipus, called, on, his, servants, to, bring, him, a, sword, that, he, might, slay, jocasta, with, his, own, hand, but, upon, discovering, the, lifeless, queen, oedipus, took, her, down, and, removing, the, long, gold, pins, from, her, dress, he, gouged, out, his, own, eyes, in, despair, the, blinded, king, now, exits, the, palace, and, begs, to, be, exiled, creon, enters, saying, that, oedipus, shall, be, taken, into, the, house, until, oracles, can, be, consulted, regarding, what, is, best, to, be, done, oedipus, s, two, daughters, and, half, sisters, antigone, and, ismene, are, sent, out, and, oedipus, laments, their, having, been, born, to, such, a, cursed, family, he, begs, creon, to, watch, over, them, in, hopes, that, they, will, live, where, there, is, opportunity, for, them, and, to, have, a, better, life, than, their, father, creon, agrees, before, sending, oedipus, back, into, the, palace, on, an, empty, stage, the, chorus, repeats, the, common, greek, maxim, that, no, man, should, be, considered, fortunate, until, he, is, dead, the, two, cities, of, troy, and, thebes, were, the, major, focus, of, greek, epic, poetry, the, events, surrounding, the, trojan, war, were, chronicled, in, the, epic, cycle, of, which, much, remains, and, those, about, thebes, in, the, theban, cycle, which, have, been, lost, the, theban, cycle, recounted, the, sequence, of, tragedies, that, befell, the, house, of, laius, of, which, the, story, of, oedipus, is, a, part, homer, s, odyssey, xi, 271ff, contains, the, earliest, account, of, the, oedipus, myth, when, odysseus, encounters, jocasta, named, epicaste, in, the, underworld, homer, briefly, summarises, the, story, of, oedipus, including, the, incest, patricide, and, jocasta, s, subsequent, suicide, however, in, the, homeric, version, oedipus, remains, king, of, thebes, after, the, revelation, and, neither, blinds, himself, nor, is, sent, into, exile, in, particular, it, is, said, that, the, gods, made, the, matter, of, his, paternity, known, whilst, in, oedipus, the, king, oedipus, very, much, discovers, the, truth, himself, in, 467, bc, sophocles, s, fellow, tragedian, aeschylus, won, first, prize, at, the, city, dionysia, with, a, trilogy, about, the, house, of, laius, comprising, laius, oedipus, and, seven, against, thebes, the, only, play, which, survives, since, he, did, not, write, connected, trilogies, as, aeschylus, did, oedipus, rex, focuses, on, the, titular, character, while, hinting, at, the, larger, myth, obliquely, which, was, already, known, to, the, audience, in, athens, at, the, time, the, trilogy, containing, oedipus, rex, took, second, prize, in, the, city, dionysia, at, its, original, performance, aeschylus, s, nephew, philocles, took, first, prize, at, that, competition, however, in, his, poetics, aristotle, considered, oedipus, rex, to, be, the, tragedy, which, best, matched, his, prescription, for, how, drama, should, be, made, many, modern, critics, agree, with, aristotle, on, the, quality, of, oedipus, rex, even, if, they, don, t, always, agree, on, the, reasons, for, example, richard, claverhouse, jebb, claimed, that, the, oedipus, tyrannus, is, in, one, sense, the, masterpiece, of, attic, tragedy, no, other, shows, an, equal, degree, of, art, in, the, development, of, the, plot, and, this, excellence, depends, on, the, powerful, and, subtle, drawing, of, the, characters, cedric, whitman, noted, that, the, oedipus, rex, passes, almost, universally, for, the, greatest, extant, greek, play, whitman, himself, regarded, the, play, as, the, fullest, expression, of, this, conception, of, tragedy, that, is, the, conception, of, tragedy, as, a, revelation, of, the, evil, lot, of, man, where, a, man, may, have, all, the, equipment, for, glory, and, honor, but, still, have, the, greatest, effort, to, do, good, end, in, the, evil, of, an, unbearable, self, for, which, one, is, not, responsible, edith, hall, referred, to, oedipus, the, king, as, this, definitive, tragedy, and, notes, that, the, magisterial, subtlety, of, sophocles, characterization, thus, lend, credibility, to, the, breathtaking, coincidences, and, notes, the, irony, that, oedipus, can, only, fulfill, his, exceptional, god, ordained, destiny, because, oedipus, is, a, preeminently, capable, and, intelligent, human, being, h, d, f, kitto, said, about, oedipus, rex, that, it, is, true, to, say, that, the, perfection, of, its, form, implies, a, world, order, although, kitto, notes, that, whether, or, not, that, world, order, is, beneficent, sophocles, does, not, say, the, science, revolution, attributed, to, thales, began, gaining, political, force, and, this, play, offered, a, warning, to, the, new, thinkers, kitto, interprets, the, play, as, sophocles, retort, to, the, sophists, by, dramatizing, a, situation, in, which, humans, face, undeserved, suffering, through, no, fault, of, their, own, but, despite, the, apparent, randomness, of, the, events, the, fact, that, they, have, been, prophesied, by, the, gods, implies, that, the, events, are, not, random, despite, the, reasons, being, beyond, human, comprehension, through, the, play, according, to, kitto, sophocles, declares, that, it, is, wrong, in, the, face, of, the, incomprehensible, and, unmoral, to, deny, the, moral, laws, and, accept, chaos, what, is, right, is, to, recognize, facts, and, not, delude, ourselves, the, universe, is, a, unity, if, sometimes, we, can, see, neither, rhyme, nor, reason, in, it, we, should, not, suppose, it, is, random, there, is, so, much, that, we, cannot, know, and, cannot, control, that, we, should, not, think, and, behave, as, if, we, do, know, and, can, control, oedipus, rex, is, widely, regarded, as, one, of, the, greatest, plays, stories, and, tragedies, ever, written, in, 2015, when, the, guardian, s, theatre, critic, michael, billington, selected, what, he, thinks, are, the, 101, greatest, plays, ever, written, oedipus, rex, was, placed, second, just, after, the, persians, fate, is, a, motif, that, often, occurs, in, greek, writing, tragedies, in, particular, likewise, where, the, attempt, to, avoid, an, oracle, is, the, very, thing, that, enables, it, to, happen, is, common, to, many, greek, myths, for, example, similarities, to, oedipus, can, be, seen, in, the, myth, of, perseus, birth, two, oracles, in, particular, dominate, the, plot, of, oedipus, rex, jocasta, relates, the, prophecy, that, was, told, to, laius, before, the, birth, of, oedipus, lines, 711, 4, told, him, that, it, was, his, fate, that, he, should, die, a, victim, at, the, hands, of, his, own, son, a, son, to, be, born, of, laius, and, me, the, oracle, told, to, laius, tells, only, of, the, patricide, whereas, the, incest, is, missing, prompted, by, jocasta, s, recollection, oedipus, reveals, the, prophecy, which, caused, him, to, leave, corinth, lines, 791, 3, that, i, was, fated, to, lie, with, my, mother, and, show, to, daylight, an, accursed, breed, which, men, would, not, endure, and, i, was, doomed, to, be, murderer, of, the, father, that, begot, me, the, implication, of, laius, s, oracle, is, ambiguous, one, interpretation, considers, that, the, presentation, of, laius, s, oracle, in, this, play, differs, from, that, found, in, aeschylus, s, oedipus, trilogy, produced, in, 467, bc, smith, 2005, argues, that, sophocles, had, the, option, of, making, the, oracle, to, laius, conditional, if, laius, has, a, son, that, son, will, kill, him, or, unconditional, laius, will, have, a, son, who, will, kill, him, both, aeschylus, and, euripides, write, plays, in, which, the, oracle, is, conditional, sophocles, chooses, to, make, laius, s, oracle, unconditional, and, thus, removes, culpability, for, his, sins, from, oedipus, for, he, could, not, have, done, other, than, what, he, did, no, matter, what, action, he, took, this, interpretation, is, supported, by, jocasta, s, repetition, of, the, oracle, at, lines, 854, 55, loxias, declared, that, the, king, should, be, killed, by, his, own, son, in, greek, jocasta, uses, the, verb, chr, nai, to, be, fated, necessary, this, iteration, of, the, oracle, seems, to, suggest, that, it, was, unconditional, and, inevitable, other, scholars, have, nonetheless, argued, that, sophocles, follows, tradition, in, making, laius, s, oracle, conditional, and, thus, avoidable, they, point, to, jocasta, s, initial, disclosure, of, the, oracle, at, lines, 711, 14, in, greek, the, oracle, cautions, h, s, auton, hexoi, moira, pros, paidos, thanein, hostis, genoit, emou, te, kakeinou, para, the, two, verbs, in, boldface, indicate, what, is, called, a, future, more, vivid, condition, if, a, child, is, born, to, laius, his, fate, to, be, killed, by, that, child, will, overtake, him, whatever, the, meaning, of, laius, s, oracle, the, one, delivered, to, oedipus, is, clearly, unconditional, given, the, modern, conception, of, fate, and, fatalism, readers, of, the, play, have, a, tendency, to, view, oedipus, as, a, mere, puppet, controlled, by, greater, forces, a, man, crushed, by, the, gods, and, fate, for, no, good, reason, this, however, is, not, an, entirely, accurate, reading, while, it, is, a, mythological, truism, that, oracles, exist, to, be, fulfilled, oracles, do, not, cause, the, events, that, lead, up, to, the, outcome, in, his, landmark, essay, on, misunderstanding, the, oedipus, rex, e, r, dodds, draws, upon, bernard, knox, s, comparison, with, jesus, prophecy, at, the, last, supper, that, peter, would, deny, him, three, times, jesus, knows, that, peter, will, do, this, but, readers, would, in, no, way, suggest, that, peter, was, a, puppet, of, fate, being, forced, to, deny, christ, free, will, and, predestination, are, by, no, means, mutually, exclusive, and, such, is, the, case, with, oedipus, the, oracle, delivered, to, oedipus, is, what, is, often, called, a, self, fulfilling, prophecy, whereby, a, prophecy, itself, sets, in, motion, events, that, conclude, with, its, own, fulfilment, this, however, is, not, to, say, that, oedipus, is, a, victim, of, fate, and, has, no, free, will, the, oracle, inspires, a, series, of, specific, choices, freely, made, by, oedipus, which, lead, him, to, kill, his, father, and, marry, his, mother, oedipus, chooses, not, to, return, to, corinth, after, hearing, the, oracle, just, as, he, chooses, to, head, toward, thebes, to, kill, laius, and, to, take, jocasta, specifically, as, his, wife, in, response, to, the, plague, at, thebes, he, chooses, to, send, creon, to, the, oracle, for, advice, and, then, to, follow, that, advice, initiating, the, investigation, into, laius, murder, none, of, these, choices, are, predetermined, another, characteristic, of, oracles, in, myth, is, that, they, are, almost, always, misunderstood, by, those, who, hear, them, hence, oedipus, misunderstanding, the, significance, of, the, delphic, oracle, he, visits, delphi, to, find, out, who, his, real, parents, are, and, assumes, that, the, oracle, refuses, to, answer, that, question, offering, instead, an, unrelated, prophecy, which, forecasts, patricide, and, incest, oedipus, assumption, is, incorrect, the, oracle, does, in, a, way, answer, his, question, on, closer, analysis, the, oracle, contains, essential, information, which, oedipus, seems, to, neglect, the, wording, of, the, oracle, i, was, doomed, to, be, murderer, of, the, father, that, begot, me, refers, to, oedipus, real, biological, father, likewise, the, mother, with, polluted, children, is, defined, as, the, biological, one, the, wording, of, the, drunken, guest, on, the, other, hand, you, are, not, your, father, s, son, defines, polybus, as, only, a, foster, father, to, oedipus, the, two, wordings, support, each, other, and, point, to, the, two, sets, of, parents, alternative, thus, the, question, of, two, sets, of, parents, biological, and, foster, is, raised, oedipus, reaction, to, the, oracle, is, irrational, he, states, he, did, not, get, any, answer, and, he, flees, in, a, direction, away, from, corinth, showing, that, he, firmly, believed, at, the, time, that, polybus, and, merope, are, his, real, parents, the, scene, with, the, drunken, guest, constitutes, the, end, of, oedipus, childhood, he, can, no, longer, ignore, a, feeling, of, uncertainty, about, his, parentage, however, after, consulting, the, oracle, this, uncertainty, disappears, strangely, enough, and, is, replaced, by, a, totally, unjustified, certainty, that, he, is, the, son, of, merope, and, polybus, we, have, said, that, this, irrational, behaviour, his, hamartia, as, aristotle, puts, it, is, due, to, the, repression, of, a, whole, series, of, thoughts, in, his, consciousness, in, fact, everything, that, referred, to, his, earlier, doubts, about, his, parentage, the, exploration, of, the, theme, of, state, control, in, oedipus, rex, is, paralleled, by, the, examination, of, the, conflict, between, the, individual, and, the, state, in, antigone, the, dilemma, that, oedipus, faces, here, is, similar, to, that, of, the, tyrannical, creon, each, man, has, as, king, made, a, decision, that, his, subjects, question, or, disobey, and, each, king, misconstrues, both, his, own, role, as, a, sovereign, and, the, role, of, the, rebel, when, informed, by, the, blind, prophet, tiresias, that, religious, forces, are, against, him, each, king, claims, that, the, priest, has, been, corrupted, it, is, here, however, that, their, similarities, come, to, an, end, while, creon, sees, the, havoc, he, has, wreaked, and, tries, to, amend, his, mistakes, oedipus, refuses, to, listen, to, anyone, the, above, text, comes, almost, directly, from, david, grene, s, introduction, to, sophocles, i, university, of, chicago, press, 1954, sophocles, uses, dramatic, irony, to, present, the, downfall, of, oedipus, at, the, beginning, of, the, story, oedipus, is, portrayed, as, self, confident, intelligent, and, strong, willed, by, the, end, it, is, within, these, traits, that, he, finds, his, demise, one, of, the, most, significant, instances, of, irony, in, this, tragedy, is, when, tiresias, hints, to, oedipus, what, he, has, done, that, he, has, slain, his, own, father, and, married, his, own, mother, lines, 457, 60, to, his, children, he, will, discover, that, he, is, both, brother, and, father, to, the, woman, who, gave, birth, to, him, he, is, son, and, husband, and, to, his, father, both, a, sharer, of, his, bed, and, his, murderer, go, into, your, palace, then, king, oedipus, and, think, about, these, things, and, if, you, find, me, a, liar, then, you, can, truly, say, i, know, nothing, of, prophecies, the, audience, knows, the, truth, and, what, would, be, the, fate, of, oedipus, oedipus, on, the, other, hand, chooses, to, deny, the, reality, that, has, confronted, him, he, ignores, the, word, of, tiresias, and, continues, on, his, journey, to, find, the, supposed, killer, his, search, for, a, murderer, is, yet, another, instance, of, irony, oedipus, determined, to, find, the, one, responsible, for, king, laius, death, announces, to, his, people, lines, 247, 53, 466, 467, i, hereby, call, down, curses, on, this, killer, that, horribly, as, he, is, horrible, he, may, drag, out, his, wretched, unblessed, days, this, too, i, pray, though, he, be, of, my, house, if, i, learn, of, it, and, let, him, still, remain, may, i, receive, the, curse, i, have, laid, on, others, this, is, ironic, as, oedipus, is, as, he, discovers, the, slayer, of, laius, and, the, curse, he, wishes, upon, the, killer, he, has, actually, wished, upon, himself, glassberg, 2017, explains, that, oedipus, has, clearly, missed, the, mark, he, is, unaware, that, he, is, the, one, polluting, agent, he, seeks, to, punish, he, has, inadequate, knowledge, literal, and, metaphorical, references, to, eyesight, appear, throughout, oedipus, rex, clear, vision, serves, as, a, metaphor, for, insight, and, knowledge, yet, the, clear, eyed, oedipus, is, blind, to, the, truth, about, his, origins, and, inadvertent, crimes, the, prophet, tiresias, on, the, other, hand, although, literally, blind, sees, the, truth, and, relays, what, is, revealed, to, him, only, after, oedipus, gouges, out, his, own, eyes, physically, blinding, himself, does, he, gain, prophetic, ability, as, exhibited, in, oedipus, at, colonus, it, is, deliberately, ironic, that, the, seer, can, see, better, than, oedipus, despite, being, blind, tiresias, in, anger, expresses, such, lines, 495, 500, 11, since, you, have, chosen, to, insult, my, blindness, you, have, your, eyesight, and, you, do, not, see, how, miserable, you, are, or, where, you, live, or, who, it, is, who, shares, your, household, do, you, know, the, family, you, come, from, without, your, knowledge, you, ve, become, the, enemy, of, your, own, kindred, oedipus, switches, back, and, forth, calling, laius, a, tyrant, lines, 128, 129, and, a, king, lines, 254, 256, throughout, the, duration, of, the, play, this, is, done, as, a, way, to, make, laius, his, equal, in, terms, of, ruling, laius, was, a, legitimate, king, whereas, oedipus, had, no, legitimate, claim, to, rule, oedipus, s, claims, of, calling, laius, a, tyrant, hint, at, his, own, insecurities, of, being, a, tyrant, the, tyranny, brought, down, the, way, it, was, what, troubles, could, keep, you, from, looking, into, it, for, even, if, a, god, weren, t, forcing, this, on, you, you, shouldn, t, leave, it, festering, so, and, this, the, case, of, a, noble, man, your, murdered, king, sigmund, freud, wrote, a, notable, passage, in, interpretation, of, dreams, regarding, the, destiny, of, oedipus, as, well, as, the, oedipus, complex, he, analyzes, why, this, play, oedipus, rex, written, in, ancient, greece, is, so, effective, even, to, a, modern, audience, 279, 280, his, destiny, moves, us, only, because, it, might, have, been, ours, because, the, oracle, laid, the, same, curse, upon, us, before, our, birth, as, upon, him, it, is, the, fate, of, all, of, us, perhaps, to, direct, our, first, sexual, impulse, towards, our, mother, and, our, first, hatred, and, our, first, murderous, wish, against, our, father, our, dreams, convince, us, that, this, is, so, freud, goes, on, to, indicate, however, that, the, primordial, urges, and, fears, that, are, his, concern, are, not, found, primarily, in, the, play, by, sophocles, but, exist, in, the, myth, the, play, is, based, on, he, refers, to, oedipus, rex, as, a, further, modification, of, the, legend, one, that, originates, in, a, misconceived, secondary, revision, of, the, material, which, has, sought, to, exploit, it, for, theological, purposes, 247, in, her, article, oedipal, textuality, reading, freud, s, reading, of, oedipus, cynthia, chase, explains, oedipus, rex, as, a, story, of,
