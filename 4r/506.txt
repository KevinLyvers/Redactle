postmodernism, is, a, term, used, to, refer, to, a, variety, of, artistic, cultural, and, philosophical, movements, that, claim, to, mark, a, break, from, modernism, what, they, have, in, common, is, the, conviction, that, it, is, no, longer, possible, to, rely, upon, previous, ways, of, representing, reality, still, there, is, disagreement, among, experts, about, its, more, precise, meaning, even, within, narrow, contexts, the, term, began, to, acquire, its, current, range, of, meanings, in, literary, criticism, and, architectural, theory, during, the, 1950s, 1960s, in, opposition, to, modernism, s, alleged, self, seriousness, postmodernism, is, characterized, by, its, playful, use, of, irony, and, pastiche, among, other, features, critics, claim, it, supplants, moral, political, and, aesthetic, ideals, with, mere, style, and, spectacle, in, the, 1990s, postmodernism, came, to, denote, a, general, and, in, general, celebratory, response, to, cultural, pluralism, proponents, align, themselves, with, feminism, multiculturalism, and, postcolonialism, building, upon, poststructural, theory, postmodern, thought, defined, itself, by, the, rejection, of, any, single, foundational, historical, narrative, this, called, into, question, the, legitimacy, of, the, enlightenment, account, of, progress, and, rationality, critics, allege, that, its, premises, lead, to, a, nihilistic, form, of, relativism, in, this, sense, it, has, become, a, term, of, abuse, in, popular, culture, postmodernism, is, a, highly, contested, term, referring, to, a, particularly, unstable, concept, that, names, many, different, kinds, of, cultural, objects, and, phenomena, in, many, different, ways, in, western, philosophy, it, s, considered, to, be, a, movement, from, the, late, 20th, century, marked, by, broad, subjectivity, skepticism, and, relativism, it, involves, a, distrust, of, reason, and, awareness, of, how, ideology, influences, economic, and, political, power, in, broad, terms, postmodernism, is, viewed, as, a, dismissal, of, many, of, the, cultural, certainties, that, have, shaped, western, society, for, the, past, 200, years, in, postmodernism, we, are, unable, to, determine, what, is, true, or, false, real, or, fake, valuable, or, worthless, what, actions, to, take, or, avoid, or, what, beliefs, to, hold, or, reject, it, is, diffuse, fragmentary, multi, dimensional, critics, have, described, it, as, an, exasperating, term, and, claim, that, its, indefinability, is, a, truism, put, otherwise, postmodernism, is, several, things, at, once, it, has, no, single, definition, and, the, term, does, not, name, any, single, unified, phenomenon, but, rather, many, diverse, phenomena, postmodernisms, rather, than, one, postmodernism, although, postmodernisms, are, generally, united, in, their, effort, to, transcend, the, perceived, limits, of, modernism, modernism, also, means, different, things, to, different, critics, in, various, arts, further, there, are, outliers, on, even, this, basic, stance, for, instance, literary, critic, william, spanos, conceives, postmodernism, not, in, period, terms, but, in, terms, of, a, certain, kind, of, literary, imagination, so, that, pre, modern, texts, such, as, euripides, orestes, or, cervantes, don, quixote, count, as, postmodern, scholar, hans, bertens, offers, the, following, if, there, is, a, common, denominator, to, all, these, postmodernisms, it, is, that, of, a, crisis, in, representation, a, deeply, felt, loss, of, faith, in, our, ability, to, represent, the, real, in, the, widest, sense, no, matter, whether, they, are, aesthestic, epistemological, moral, or, political, in, nature, the, representations, that, we, used, to, rely, on, can, no, longer, be, taken, for, granted, the, term, first, appeared, in, print, in, 1870, but, it, only, began, to, enter, circulation, with, its, current, range, of, meanings, in, the, 1950s, 60s, the, term, postmodern, was, first, used, in, 1870, by, the, artist, john, watkins, chapman, who, described, a, postmodern, style, of, painting, as, a, departure, from, french, impressionism, similarly, the, first, citation, given, by, the, oxford, english, dictionary, is, dated, to, 1916, describing, gus, mager, as, one, of, the, few, post, modern, painters, whose, style, is, convincing, episcopal, priest, and, cultural, commentator, j, m, thompson, in, a, 1914, article, uses, the, term, to, describe, changes, in, attitudes, and, beliefs, in, the, critique, of, religion, writing, the, raison, d, tre, of, post, modernism, is, to, escape, from, the, double, mindedness, of, modernism, by, being, thorough, in, its, criticism, by, extending, it, to, religion, as, well, as, theology, to, catholic, feeling, as, well, as, to, catholic, tradition, in, 1926, bernard, iddings, bell, president, of, st, stephen, s, college, and, also, an, episcopal, priest, published, postmodernism, and, other, essays, which, marks, the, first, use, of, the, term, to, describe, an, historical, period, following, modernity, the, essay, criticizes, lingering, socio, cultural, norms, attitudes, and, practices, of, the, enlightenment, it, is, also, critical, of, a, purported, cultural, shift, away, from, traditional, christian, beliefs, the, term, postmodernity, was, first, used, in, an, academic, historical, context, as, a, general, concept, for, a, movement, by, arnold, j, toynbee, in, a, 1939, essay, which, states, that, our, own, post, modern, age, has, been, inaugurated, by, the, general, war, of, 1914, 1918, in, 1942, the, literary, critic, and, author, h, r, hays, describes, postmodernism, as, a, new, literary, form, also, in, the, arts, the, term, was, first, used, in, 1949, to, describe, a, dissatisfaction, with, the, modernist, architectural, movement, known, as, the, international, style, although, these, early, uses, anticipate, some, of, the, concerns, of, the, debate, in, the, second, part, of, the, 20th, century, there, is, little, direct, continuity, in, the, discussion, just, when, the, new, discussion, begins, however, is, also, a, matter, of, dispute, various, authors, place, its, beginnings, in, the, 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, and, 1980s, in, the, mid, 1970s, the, american, sociologist, daniel, bell, provided, a, general, account, of, the, postmodern, as, an, effectively, nihilistic, response, to, modernism, s, alleged, assault, on, the, protestant, work, ethic, and, its, rejection, of, what, he, upheld, as, traditional, values, the, ideals, of, modernity, per, his, diagnosis, were, degraded, to, the, level, of, consumer, choice, this, research, project, however, was, not, taken, up, in, a, significant, way, by, others, until, the, mid, 1980s, when, the, work, of, jean, baudrillard, and, fredrick, jameson, building, upon, art, and, literary, criticism, reintroduced, the, term, to, sociology, discussion, about, the, postmodern, in, the, second, part, of, the, 20th, century, was, most, articulate, in, areas, with, a, large, body, of, critical, discourse, around, the, modernist, movement, even, here, however, there, continued, to, be, disagreement, about, such, basic, issues, as, whether, postmodernism, is, a, break, with, modernism, a, renewal, and, intensification, of, modernism, or, even, both, at, once, a, rejection, and, a, radicalization, of, its, historical, predecessor, according, to, scholar, steven, connor, discussions, of, the, 1970s, were, dominated, by, literary, criticism, to, be, supplanted, by, architectural, theory, in, the, 1980s, some, of, these, conversations, made, use, of, french, poststructuralist, thought, but, only, after, these, innovations, and, critical, discourse, in, the, arts, did, postmodernism, emerge, as, a, philosophical, term, in, its, own, right, according, to, scholar, ian, buchanan, the, black, mountain, poets, charles, olson, and, robert, creeley, first, introduced, the, term, postmodern, in, its, current, sense, during, the, 1950s, their, stance, against, modernist, poetry, and, olson, s, heideggerian, orientation, were, influential, in, the, identification, of, postmodernism, as, a, polemical, position, opposed, to, the, rationalist, values, championed, by, the, enlightenment, project, during, the, 1960s, this, affirmative, use, gave, way, to, a, pejorative, use, by, the, new, left, who, used, it, to, describe, a, waning, commitment, among, youth, to, the, political, ideals, socialism, and, communism, the, literary, critic, irving, howe, for, instance, denounced, postmodern, literature, for, being, content, to, merely, reflect, rather, than, actively, attempt, to, refashion, what, he, saw, as, the, increasingly, shapeless, character, of, contemporary, society, in, the, 1970s, this, changed, again, largely, under, the, influence, of, the, literary, critic, ihab, hassan, s, large, scale, survey, of, works, that, he, said, could, no, longer, be, called, modern, taking, the, black, mountain, poets, an, exemplary, instance, of, the, new, postmodern, type, hassan, celebrates, its, nietzschean, playfulness, and, cheerfully, anarchic, spirit, which, he, sets, off, against, the, high, seriousness, of, modernism, yet, from, another, perspective, friedrich, nietzsche, s, attack, on, western, philosophy, and, martin, heidegger, s, critique, of, metaphysics, posed, deep, theoretical, problems, not, necessarily, a, cause, for, aesthetic, celebration, their, further, influence, on, the, conversation, about, postmodernism, however, would, be, largely, mediated, by, french, poststructuralism, if, literature, was, at, the, center, of, the, discussion, in, the, 1970s, architecture, is, at, the, center, in, the, 1980s, the, architectural, theorist, charles, jencks, in, particular, connects, the, artistic, avant, garde, to, social, change, in, a, way, that, captures, attention, outside, of, academia, jenckes, much, influenced, by, the, american, architect, robert, venturi, celebrates, a, plurality, of, forms, and, encourages, participation, and, active, engagement, with, the, local, context, of, the, built, environment, he, presents, this, as, in, opposition, to, the, authoritarian, style, of, international, modernism, in, the, 1970s, postmodern, criticism, increasingly, came, to, incorporate, poststructuralist, theory, particularly, the, deconstructive, approach, to, texts, most, strongly, associated, with, jacques, derrida, derrida, attempted, to, demonstrate, that, the, whole, foundationalist, approach, to, language, and, knowledge, was, untenable, and, misguided, he, was, also, critical, of, what, he, claimed, to, expose, as, the, artificial, binary, oppositions, e, g, subject, object, speech, writing, that, he, claims, are, at, the, heart, of, western, culture, and, philosophy, it, is, during, this, period, that, postmodernism, comes, to, be, particularly, equated, with, a, kind, of, anti, representational, self, reflexivity, in, the, 1980s, some, critics, begin, to, take, an, interest, in, the, work, of, michel, foucault, this, introduces, a, political, concern, about, social, power, relations, into, discussions, about, postmodernism, much, of, foucault, s, project, is, against, the, enlightenment, tradition, to, expose, modern, social, institutions, and, forms, of, knowledge, as, historically, contingent, forces, of, domination, he, aims, detotalize, or, decenter, historical, narratives, to, display, modern, consciousness, as, it, is, constituted, by, specific, discourses, and, institutions, that, shape, individuals, into, the, docile, subjects, of, social, systems, this, is, also, the, beginning, of, the, affiliation, of, postmodernism, with, feminism, and, multiculturalism, the, art, critic, craig, owens, in, particular, not, only, made, the, connection, to, feminism, explicit, but, went, so, far, as, to, claim, feminism, for, postmodernism, wholesale, a, broad, claim, resisted, by, even, many, sympathetic, feminists, such, as, nancy, fraser, and, linda, nicholson, although, postmodern, criticism, and, thought, drew, on, philosophical, ideas, from, early, on, postmodernism, was, only, introduced, to, the, expressly, philosophical, lexicon, by, jean, fran, ois, lyotard, in, his, 1979, the, postmodern, condition, a, report, on, knowledge, in, this, influential, work, lyotard, offers, the, following, definition, simplifying, to, the, extreme, i, define, postmodern, as, incredulity, towards, metanarratives, in, a, society, with, no, unifying, narrative, he, argues, we, are, left, with, heterogeneous, group, specific, narratives, or, language, games, as, adopted, from, ludwig, wittgenstein, with, no, universal, perspective, from, which, to, adjudicate, among, them, according, to, lyotard, this, introduces, a, general, crisis, of, legitimacy, a, theme, he, adopts, from, the, philosopher, j, rgen, habermas, whose, theory, of, communicative, rationality, lyotard, rejects, while, he, was, particularly, concerned, with, the, way, that, this, insight, undermines, claims, of, scientific, objectivity, lyotard, s, argument, undermines, the, entire, principle, of, transcendent, legitimization, instead, proponents, of, a, language, game, must, make, the, case, for, their, legitimacy, with, reference, to, such, considerations, as, efficiency, or, practicality, far, from, celebrating, the, apparently, relativistic, consequences, of, this, argument, however, lyotard, focused, much, of, his, subsequent, work, on, how, links, among, games, could, be, established, particularly, with, respect, to, ethics, and, politics, nevertheless, the, appearance, of, linguistic, relativism, inspired, an, extensive, rebuttal, by, the, marxist, critic, fredrick, jameson, building, upon, the, theoretical, foundations, laid, out, by, the, marxist, economist, ernst, mandel, and, observations, in, the, early, work, of, the, french, sociologist, jean, baudrillard, jameson, develops, his, own, conception, of, the, postmodern, as, the, cultural, logic, of, late, capitalism, in, the, form, of, an, enormous, cultural, expansion, into, an, economy, of, spectacle, and, style, rather, than, the, production, of, goods, baudrillard, himself, broke, with, marxism, but, continued, to, theorize, the, postmodern, as, the, condition, in, which, the, domain, of, reality, has, become, so, heavily, mediated, by, signs, as, to, become, inaccessible, in, itself, leaving, us, entirely, in, the, domain, of, the, simulacrum, an, image, that, bears, no, relation, to, anything, outside, of, itself, scholars, however, disagree, about, whether, his, later, works, are, intended, as, science, fiction, or, truthful, theoretical, claims, in, the, 1990s, postmodernism, became, increasingly, identified, with, critical, and, philosophical, discourse, directly, about, postmodernity, or, the, postmodern, idiom, itself, no, longer, centered, on, any, particular, art, or, even, the, arts, in, general, it, instead, turns, to, address, the, more, general, problems, posed, to, society, in, general, by, a, new, proliferation, of, cultures, and, forms, it, is, during, this, period, that, it, also, comes, to, be, associated, with, postcolonialism, and, identity, politics, around, this, time, postmodernism, also, begins, to, be, conceived, in, popular, culture, as, a, general, philosophical, disposition, associated, with, a, loose, sort, of, relativism, in, this, sense, the, term, also, starts, to, appear, as, a, casual, term, of, abuse, in, non, academic, contexts, others, identify, it, as, an, aesthetic, lifestyle, of, eclecticism, and, playful, self, irony, scholarship, regarding, postmodernism, and, architecture, is, closely, linked, with, the, writings, of, critic, turned, architect, charles, jencks, beginning, with, lectures, in, the, early, 1970s, and, his, essay, the, rise, of, post, modern, architecture, from, 1975, his, magnum, opus, however, is, the, book, the, language, of, post, modern, architecture, first, published, in, 1977, and, since, running, to, seven, editions, jencks, makes, the, point, that, postmodernism, like, modernism, varies, for, each, field, of, art, and, that, for, architecture, it, is, not, just, a, reaction, to, modernism, but, what, he, terms, double, coding, double, coding, the, combination, of, modern, techniques, with, something, else, usually, traditional, building, in, order, for, architecture, to, communicate, with, the, public, and, a, concerned, minority, usually, other, architects, in, their, book, revisiting, postmodernism, terry, farrell, and, adam, furman, argue, that, postmodernism, brought, a, more, joyous, and, sensual, experience, to, the, culture, particularly, in, architecture, for, instance, in, response, to, the, modernist, slogan, of, ludwig, mies, van, der, rohe, that, less, is, more, the, postmodernist, robert, venturi, rejoined, that, less, is, a, bore, the, term, postmodern, dance, is, most, strongly, associated, with, the, dancers, of, the, judson, dance, theater, located, in, new, york, city, during, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, arguably, its, most, important, principle, is, taken, from, the, composer, john, cage, s, efforts, to, break, down, the, distinction, between, art, and, life, this, was, developed, in, particular, by, the, american, dancer, and, choreographer, merce, cunningham, in, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, dance, began, to, incorporate, other, typically, postmodern, features, such, as, the, mixing, of, genres, challenging, high, low, cultural, distinctions, and, incorporating, a, political, dimension, early, mention, of, postmodernism, as, an, element, of, graphic, design, appeared, in, the, british, magazine, design, a, characteristic, of, postmodern, graphic, design, is, that, retro, techno, punk, grunge, beach, parody, and, pastiche, were, all, conspicuous, trends, each, had, its, own, sites, and, venues, detractors, and, advocates, in, 1971, the, american, scholar, ihab, hassan, made, the, term, popular, in, literary, studies, as, a, description, of, the, new, art, emerging, in, the, 1960s, according, to, scholar, david, herwitz, writers, such, as, john, barth, and, donald, barthelme, and, later, thomas, pynchon, responded, in, various, ways, to, the, aesthetic, innovations, of, finnegans, wake, and, the, late, work, of, samuel, beckett, postmodern, literature, often, calls, attention, to, issues, regarding, its, own, complicated, connection, to, reality, the, french, critic, roland, barthes, declared, the, novel, to, be, an, exhaustive, form, and, explored, what, it, means, to, continue, to, write, novels, under, such, a, condition, in, postmodernist, fiction, 1987, brian, mchale, details, the, shift, from, modernism, to, postmodernism, arguing, that, the, former, is, characterized, by, an, epistemological, dominant, and, that, postmodern, works, have, developed, out, of, modernism, and, are, primarily, concerned, with, questions, of, ontology, mchale, s, what, was, postmodernism, 2007, follows, raymond, federman, s, lead, in, now, using, the, past, tense, when, discussing, postmodernism, the, composer, jonathan, kramer, has, written, that, avant, garde, musical, compositions, which, some, would, consider, modernist, rather, than, postmodernist, defy, more, than, seduce, the, listener, and, they, extend, by, potentially, unsettling, means, the, very, idea, of, what, music, is, in, the, 1960s, composers, such, as, terry, riley, henryk, g, recki, bradley, joseph, john, adams, steve, reich, philip, glass, michael, nyman, and, lou, harrison, reacted, to, the, perceived, elitism, and, dissonant, sound, of, atonal, academic, modernism, by, producing, music, with, simple, textures, and, relatively, consonant, harmonies, whilst, others, most, notably, john, cage, challenged, the, prevailing, narratives, of, beauty, and, objectivity, common, to, modernism, author, on, postmodernism, dominic, strinati, has, noted, it, is, also, important, to, include, in, this, category, the, so, called, art, rock, musical, innovations, and, mixing, of, styles, associated, with, groups, like, talking, heads, and, performers, like, laurie, anderson, together, with, the, self, conscious, reinvention, of, disco, by, the, pet, shop, boys, in, the, late, 20th, century, avant, garde, academics, labelled, american, singer, madonna, as, the, personification, of, the, postmodern, because, the, postmodern, condition, is, characterized, by, fragmentation, de, differentiation, pastiche, retrospection, and, anti, foundationalism, which, they, argued, madonna, embodied, christian, writer, graham, cray, also, said, that, madonna, is, perhaps, the, most, visible, example, of, what, is, called, post, modernism, and, martin, amis, described, her, as, perhaps, the, most, postmodern, personage, on, the, planet, she, was, also, suggested, by, literary, critic, olivier, s, cardin, to, epitomise, postmodernism, in, the, 1970s, a, disparate, group, of, poststructuralists, in, france, developed, a, critique, of, modern, philosophy, with, roots, discernible, in, friedrich, nietzsche, s, ren, kierkegaard, and, martin, heidegger, although, few, themselves, relied, upon, the, term, they, became, known, to, many, as, postmodern, theorists, notable, figures, include, jacques, derrida, michel, foucault, jean, fran, ois, lyotard, jean, baudrillard, and, others, by, the, 1980s, this, spread, to, america, in, the, work, of, richard, rorty, and, others, poststructuralists, like, structuralists, start, from, the, assumption, that, people, s, identities, values, and, economic, conditions, determine, each, other, rather, than, having, intrinsic, properties, that, can, be, understood, in, isolation, while, structuralism, explores, how, meaning, is, produced, by, a, set, of, essential, relationships, in, an, overarching, quasi, linguistic, system, poststructuralism, accepts, this, premise, but, rejects, the, assumption, that, such, systems, can, ever, be, fixed, or, centered, deconstruction, is, a, practice, of, philosophy, literary, criticism, and, textual, analysis, developed, by, jacques, derrida, derrida, s, work, has, been, seen, as, rooted, in, a, statement, found, in, of, grammatology, il, n, y, a, pas, de, hors, texte, there, is, no, outside, text, this, statement, is, part, of, a, critique, of, inside, and, outside, metaphors, when, referring, to, the, text, and, is, a, corollary, to, the, observation, that, there, is, no, inside, of, a, text, as, well, this, attention, to, a, text, s, unacknowledged, reliance, on, metaphors, and, figures, embedded, within, its, discourse, is, characteristic, of, derrida, s, approach, derrida, s, method, sometimes, involves, demonstrating, that, a, given, philosophical, discourse, depends, on, binary, oppositions, or, excluding, terms, that, the, discourse, itself, has, declared, to, be, irrelevant, or, inapplicable, derrida, s, philosophy, inspired, a, postmodern, movement, called, deconstructivism, among, architects, characterized, by, a, design, that, rejects, structural, centers, and, encourages, decentralized, play, among, its, elements, derrida, discontinued, his, involvement, with, the, movement, after, the, publication, of, his, collaborative, project, with, architect, peter, eisenman, in, chora, l, works, jacques, derrida, and, peter, eisenman, jean, fran, ois, lyotard, is, credited, with, being, the, first, to, use, the, term, postmodern, in, a, philosophical, context, in, his, 1979, work, the, postmodern, condition, a, report, on, knowledge, in, it, he, follows, wittgenstein, s, language, games, model, and, speech, act, theory, contrasting, two, different, language, games, that, of, the, expert, and, that, of, the, philosopher, he, talks, about, the, transformation, of, knowledge, into, information, in, the, computer, age, and, likens, the, transmission, or, reception, of, coded, messages, information, to, a, position, within, a, language, game, lyotard, defined, philosophical, postmodernism, in, the, postmodern, condition, writing, simplifying, to, the, extreme, i, define, postmodern, as, incredulity, towards, metanarratives, where, what, he, means, by, metanarrative, in, french, grands, r, cits, is, something, like, a, unified, complete, universal, and, epistemically, certain, story, about, everything, that, is, against, totalizing, metanarratives, lyotard, and, other, postmodern, philosophers, argue, that, truth, is, always, dependent, upon, historical, and, social, context, rather, than, being, absolute, and, universal, and, that, truth, is, always, partial, and, at, issue, rather, than, being, complete, and, certain, modernism, sought, to, design, and, plan, cities, that, followed, the, logic, of, the, new, model, of, industrial, mass, production, reverting, to, large, scale, solutions, aesthetic, standardisation, and, prefabricated, design, solutions, modernism, eroded, urban, living, by, its, failure, to, recognise, differences, and, aim, towards, homogeneous, landscapes, simonsen, 1990, 57, jane, jacobs, 1961, book, the, death, and, life, of, great, american, cities, was, a, sustained, critique, of, urban, planning, as, it, had, developed, within, modernism, and, marked, a, transition, from, modernity, to, postmodernity, in, thinking, about, urban, planning, the, transition, from, modernism, to, postmodernism, is, often, said, to, have, happened, at, 3, 32, pm, on, 15, july, in, 1972, when, pruitt, igoe, a, housing, development, for, low, income, people, in, st, louis, designed, by, architect, minoru, yamasaki, which, had, been, a, prize, winning, version, of, le, corbusier, s, machine, for, modern, living, was, deemed, uninhabitable, and, was, torn, down, since, then, postmodernism, has, involved, theories, that, embrace, and, aim, to, create, diversity, it, exalts, uncertainty, flexibility, and, change, and, rejects, utopianism, while, embracing, a, utopian, way, of, thinking, and, acting, postmodernity, of, resistance, seeks, to, deconstruct, modernism, and, is, a, critique, of, the, origins, without, necessarily, returning, to, them, as, a, result, of, postmodernism, planners, are, much, less, inclined, to, lay, a, firm, or, steady, claim, to, there, being, one, single, right, way, of, engaging, in, urban, planning, and, are, more, open, to, different, styles, and, ideas, of, how, to, plan, the, postmodern, approach, to, understanding, the, city, were, pioneered, in, the, 1980s, by, what, could, be, called, the, los, angeles, school, of,
