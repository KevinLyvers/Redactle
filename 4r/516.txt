outsider, art, is, art, made, by, self, taught, individuals, who, are, untrained, and, untutored, in, the, traditional, arts, with, typically, little, or, no, contact, with, the, conventions, of, the, art, worlds, the, term, outsider, art, was, coined, in, 1972, as, the, title, of, a, book, by, art, critic, roger, cardinal, it, is, an, english, equivalent, for, art, brut, french, raw, art, or, rough, art, a, label, created, in, the, 1940s, by, french, artist, jean, dubuffet, to, describe, art, created, outside, the, boundaries, of, official, culture, dubuffet, focused, particularly, on, art, by, those, on, the, outside, of, the, established, art, scene, using, as, examples, psychiatric, hospital, patients, hermits, and, spiritualists, outsider, art, has, emerged, as, a, successful, art, marketing, category, an, annual, outsider, art, fair, has, taken, place, in, new, york, since, 1993, and, there, are, at, least, two, regularly, published, journals, dedicated, to, the, subject, the, term, is, sometimes, applied, as, a, marketing, label, for, art, created, by, people, who, are, outside, the, mainstream, art, world, or, art, gallery, system, regardless, of, their, circumstances, or, the, content, of, their, work, a, more, specific, term, outsider, music, was, later, adapted, for, musicians, interest, in, the, art, of, the, mentally, ill, along, with, that, of, children, and, the, makers, of, peasant, art, was, first, demonstrated, by, der, blaue, reiter, group, wassily, kandinsky, august, macke, franz, marc, alexej, von, jawlensky, and, others, what, the, artists, perceived, in, the, work, of, these, groups, was, an, expressive, power, born, of, their, perceived, lack, of, sophistication, examples, of, this, were, reproduced, in, 1912, in, the, first, and, only, issue, of, their, publication, der, blaue, reiter, almanac, during, world, war, i, macke, was, killed, at, champagne, in, 1914, and, marc, was, killed, at, verdun, in, 1916, the, gap, left, by, these, deaths, was, to, some, extent, filled, by, paul, klee, who, continued, to, draw, inspiration, from, these, primitives, interest, in, the, art, of, insane, asylum, inmates, continued, to, grow, in, the, 1920s, in, 1921, dr, walter, morgenthaler, published, his, book, ein, geisteskranker, als, k, nstler, a, psychiatric, patient, as, artist, about, adolf, w, lfli, a, psychotic, mental, patient, in, his, care, w, lfli, had, spontaneously, taken, up, drawing, and, this, activity, seemed, to, calm, him, his, most, outstanding, work, was, an, illustrated, epic, of, 45, volumes, in, which, he, narrated, his, own, imaginary, life, story, with, 25, 000, pages, 1, 600, illustrations, and, 1, 500, collages, it, is, a, monumental, work, w, lfli, also, produced, a, large, number, of, smaller, works, some, of, which, were, sold, or, given, as, gifts, his, work, is, on, display, at, the, adolf, w, lfli, foundation, in, the, museum, of, fine, art, bern, a, defining, moment, was, the, publication, of, bildnerei, der, geisteskranken, artistry, of, the, mentally, ill, in, 1922, by, hans, prinzhorn, this, was, the, first, formal, study, of, psychiatric, works, based, upon, a, compilation, of, thousands, of, examples, from, european, institutions, the, book, and, the, art, collection, gained, much, attention, from, avant, garde, artists, of, the, time, including, paul, klee, max, ernst, and, jean, dubuffet, people, with, some, formal, artistic, training, as, well, as, well, established, artists, are, not, immune, from, mental, illness, and, may, also, be, institutionalized, for, example, william, kurelek, later, awarded, the, order, of, canada, for, his, artistic, life, work, as, a, young, man, was, admitted, to, the, maudsley, psychiatric, hospital, where, he, was, treated, for, schizophrenia, in, the, hospital, he, painted, producing, the, maze, a, dark, depiction, of, his, tortured, youth, he, was, transferred, from, the, maudsley, to, netherne, hospital, from, november, 1953, to, january, 1955, to, work, with, edward, adamson, 1911, 1996, a, pioneer, of, art, therapy, and, creator, of, the, adamson, collection, french, artist, jean, dubuffet, was, particularly, struck, by, bildnerei, der, geisteskranken, and, began, his, own, collection, of, such, art, which, he, called, art, brut, or, raw, art, in, 1948, he, formed, the, compagnie, de, l, art, brut, along, with, other, artists, including, andr, breton, and, claude, l, vi, strauss, the, collection, he, established, became, known, as, the, collection, de, l, art, brut, and, the, curator, was, slavko, kopa, for, almost, three, decades, it, contains, thousands, of, works, and, is, now, permanently, housed, in, lausanne, switzerland, dubuffet, characterized, art, brut, as, those, works, created, from, solitude, and, from, pure, and, authentic, creative, impulses, where, the, worries, of, competition, acclaim, and, social, promotion, do, not, interfere, are, because, of, these, very, facts, more, precious, than, the, productions, of, professionals, after, a, certain, familiarity, with, these, flourishings, of, an, exalted, feverishness, lived, so, fully, and, so, intensely, by, their, authors, we, cannot, avoid, the, feeling, that, in, relation, to, these, works, cultural, art, in, its, entirety, appears, to, be, the, game, of, a, futile, society, a, fallacious, parade, dubuffet, argued, that, culture, that, is, mainstream, culture, managed, to, assimilate, every, new, development, in, art, and, by, doing, so, took, away, whatever, power, it, might, have, had, the, result, was, to, asphyxiate, genuine, expression, art, brut, was, his, solution, to, this, problem, only, art, brut, was, immune, to, the, influences, of, culture, immune, to, being, absorbed, and, assimilated, because, the, artists, themselves, were, not, willing, or, able, to, be, assimilated, dubuffet, s, championing, of, art, brut, would, not, last, long, scholars, argue, dubuffet, s, distaste, for, the, mainstream, art, world, helped, ensure, that, art, brut, and, the, compagnie, de, l, art, brut, would, not, survive, on, a, commercial, basis, dubuffet, would, kill, art, brut, as, he, defined, it, in, his, quest, for, its, authenticity, three, years, after, the, compagnie, de, l, art, brut, was, formed, dubuffet, dissolved, it, caving, in, to, form, the, more, conventional, collection, de, l, art, brut, afterward, the, interest, in, outsider, practices, among, twentieth, century, artists, and, critics, can, be, seen, as, part, of, a, larger, emphasis, on, the, rejection, of, established, values, within, the, modernist, art, milieu, the, early, part, of, the, 20th, century, gave, rise, to, cubism, and, the, dada, constructivist, and, futurist, movements, in, art, all, of, which, involved, a, dramatic, movement, away, from, cultural, forms, of, the, past, dadaist, marcel, duchamp, for, example, abandoned, painterly, technique, to, allow, chance, operations, a, role, in, determining, the, form, of, his, works, or, simply, to, recontextualize, existing, ready, made, objects, as, art, mid, century, artists, including, pablo, picasso, looked, outside, the, traditions, of, high, culture, for, inspiration, drawing, from, the, artifacts, of, primitive, societies, the, unschooled, art, made, by, children, and, vulgar, advertising, graphics, dubuffet, s, championing, of, the, art, brut, of, the, insane, and, others, at, the, margins, of, society, is, yet, another, example, of, avant, garde, art, challenging, established, cultural, values, as, with, analysis, of, these, other, art, movements, current, discourse, indicates, art, brut, is, innately, tied, to, primitivism, due, to, its, similarity, in, its, borrowing, of, personal, de, patriation, and, exoticization, of, familiar, yet, alien, forms, a, number, of, terms, are, used, to, describe, art, that, is, loosely, understood, as, outside, of, official, culture, definitions, of, these, terms, vary, and, overlap, the, editors, of, raw, vision, a, leading, journal, in, the, field, suggest, that, whatever, views, we, have, about, the, value, of, controversy, itself, it, is, important, to, sustain, creative, discussion, by, way, of, an, agreed, vocabulary, consequently, they, lament, the, use, of, outsider, artist, to, refer, to, almost, any, untrained, artist, it, is, not, enough, to, be, untrained, clumsy, or, na, ve, outsider, art, is, virtually, synonymous, with, art, brut, in, both, spirit, and, meaning, to, that, rarity, of, art, produced, by, those, who, do, not, know, its, name
