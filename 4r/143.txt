which, was, written, in, a, poorly, understood, language, known, as, pai, ch, the, b, hatkath, is, no, longer, extant, but, several, later, adaptations, still, exist, the, kath, sarits, gara, b, hatkathamanjari, and, b, hatkath, lokasa, graha, however, none, of, these, recensions, necessarily, derives, directly, from, gunadhya, and, each, may, have, intermediate, versions, scholars, compare, gu, hya, with, vyasa, and, valmiki, even, though, he, did, not, write, the, now, long, lost, b, hatkath, in, sanskrit, presently, available, are, its, two, sanskrit, recensions, the, b, hatkathamanjari, by, k, emendra, and, the, kath, sarits, gara, by, somadeva, the, author, of, kathasaritsagara, or, rather, its, compiler, was, somadeva, the, son, of, r, ma, a, aiva, br, hman, of, kashmir, he, tells, us, that, his, magnum, opus, was, written, sometime, between, 1063, 81, ce, for, the, amusement, of, s, ryavat, wife, of, king, ananta, of, kashmir, at, whose, court, somadeva, was, poet, the, tragic, history, of, kashmir, at, this, period, ananta, s, two, sons, kala, a, and, har, a, the, worthless, degenerate, life, of, the, former, the, brilliant, but, ruthless, life, of, the, latter, the, suicide, of, ananta, himself, the, self, immolation, of, s, ryavat, on, his, funeral, pyre, and, the, resulting, chaos, forms, as, a, dark, and, grim, background, for, the, setting, of, somadeva, s, tales, the, frame, story, is, the, narrative, of, the, adventures, of, naravahanadatta, son, of, the, legendary, king, udayana, his, romances, with, damsels, of, great, beauty, and, wars, with, enemies, as, many, as, 350, tales, are, built, around, this, central, story, making, it, the, largest, existing, collection, of, indian, tales, somadeva, declares, that, his, work, is, a, faithful, though, abridged, translation, of, a, much, larger, collection, of, stories, known, as, the, b, hatkath, or, great, tale, written, in, the, lost, paisaci, dialect, by, gu, hya, but, the, kashmirian, or, northwestern, b, hatkath, that, somadeva, adapted, may, be, quite, different, from, the, paisaci, ur, text, as, at, least, 5, apparent, descendants, of, gu, hya, s, work, exist, all, quite, different, in, form, and, content, the, best, known, after, the, kath, sarits, gara, itself, probably, being, the, b, hatkath, lokasa, graha, of, budhasvamin, from, nepal, like, the, panchatantra, tales, from, the, kath, sarits, gara, or, its, related, versions, travelled, to, many, parts, of, the, world, kath, sarits, gara, consists, of, 18, lambhakas, books, of, 124, taramgas, chapters, called, as, waves, and, approximately, 22, 000, lokas, distichs, in, addition, to, prose, sections, the, loka, consists, of, 2, half, verses, of, 16, syllables, each, thus, syllabically, the, kath, sarits, gara, is, approximately, equal, to, 66, 000, lines, of, iambic, pentameter, by, comparison, john, milton, s, paradise, lost, weighs, in, at, 10, 565, lines, all, this, pales, in, comparison, to, the, presumably, legendary, 700, 000, lokas, of, the, lost, original, brihatkatha, somadeva, s, narrative, captivates, both, by, its, simple, and, clear, though, very, elegant, style, and, diction, and, by, his, skill, in, drawing, with, a, few, strokes, pictures, of, types, and, characters, taken, from, the, real, every, day, life, hence, it, is, that, even, in, the, miraculous, and, fantastical, facts, and, events, that, make, up, the, bulk, of, the, main, story, and, of, a, great, deal, of, the, incidental, tales, the, interest, of, the, reader, is, uninterruptedly, kept, his, lively, and, pleasant, art, of, story, telling, though, now, and, then, encumbered, with, inflatedness, or, vitiated, by, far, fetched, false, wit, is, enhanced, also, by, his, native, humor, and, the, elegant, and, pointed, sentences, strewn, about, here, and, there, with, a, good, taste, source, the, kath, sarits, gara, is, a, large, work, each, book, comprises, a, number, of, stories, loosely, strung, together, by, being, narrated, for, the, recreation, or, information, of, the, same, individuals, or, arising, out, of, their, adventures, these, are, udayana, king, of, kosambi, and, his, son, naravahanadatta, the, marriage, of, the, latter, with, various, damsels, of, terrestrial, or, celestial, origin, and, his, elevation, to, the, rank, of, king, of, the, vidyadharas, a, class, of, heavenly, spirits, are, the, leading, topics, of, most, of, the, books, but, they, merely, constitute, the, skeleton, of, the, composition, the, substance, being, made, up, of, stories, growing, out, of, these, circumstances, or, springing, from, one, another, with, an, ingenuity, of, intricacy, which, is, one, of, the, great, charms, of, all, such, collections, the, first, book, kathapitha, is, introductory, and, refers, the, origin, of, the, tales, contained, in, the, collection, to, shiva, who, it, is, said, related, them, in, private, conversation, with, his, wife, parvati, for, her, entertainment, one, of, the, attendants, of, the, deity, pushpadanta, took, the, liberty, of, listening, and, he, repeated, them, under, the, seal, of, secrecy, to, his, wife, jaya, a, sort, of, lady, s, maid, to, the, goddess, jaya, takes, an, opportunity, of, intimating, to, her, mistress, that, she, is, acquainted, with, the, stories, narrated, by, shiva, to, the, great, mortification, of, parvati, who, had, flattered, herself, that, they, had, been, communicated, to, her, alone, she, accordingly, complains, to, shiva, of, his, having, deceived, her, and, he, vindicates, himself, by, discovering, the, truth, parvati, thereupon, pronounces, an, imprecation, upon, pushpadanta, condemning, him, to, be, born, upon, the, earth, as, a, man, and, she, sentences, his, friend, malyavan, who, had, ventured, to, intercede, for, him, to, a, like, destination, parvati, tells, the, culprits, that, they, shall, resume, their, celestial, condition, when, pushpadanta, encountering, a, yaksha, a, follower, of, kubera, the, god, of, wealth, doomed, for, a, certain, time, to, walk, the, earth, as, a, pishacha, or, goblin, shall, recollect, his, own, former, state, and, shall, repeat, to, the, pishacha, the, stories, he, overheard, from, shiva, and, when, malyavan, falling, in, with, the, pisacha, shall, hear, from, him, again, the, stories, that, his, friend, pushpadanta, had,

matanga, is, in, truth, a, vidyadhara, he, had, conspired, against, the, life, of, naravahanadatta, in, order, to, prevent, his, becoming, emperor, of, the, vidyadharas, and, had, been, therefore, condemned, by, siva, to, live, in, ujjain, with, his, family, as, chandalas, the, curse, was, to, terminate, when, eighteen, thousand, brahmins, should, eat, in, his, house, and, this, being,

the, tricks, of, professed, cheats, somadeva, tells, us, that, the, kath, sarits, gara, is, not, his, original, work, but, is, taken, from, a, much, larger, collection, by, gu, hya, known, as, the, b, hatkath, k, emendra, the, sanskrit, aesthete, from, kashmir, had, written, his, b, hatkath, ma, jar, a, summary, of, the, b, hatkath, twenty, or, thirty, years, previously, the, kath, sarits, gara, and, the, b, hatkath, ma, jar, agree, in, the, number, and, the, titles, of, the, different, lambhakas, but, after, lambhaka, 5, disagree, in, the, order, of, them, however, all, the, books, of, the, same, name, in, both, versions, overlap, with, each, other, exactly, excluding, a, few, minor, details, except, for, two, book, 8, vela, in, k, emendra, is, a, combination, of, book, 11, vela, and, the, beginning, of, book, 14, panca, in, kath, sarits, gara, considering, that, k, emendra, composed, two, near, faithful, extracts, of, the, celebrated, epics, the, bharatamanjari, and, the, ramayanamanjari, it, is, more, probable, that, it, was, k, emendra, and, not, somadeva, who, drew, up, the, faithful, reproduction, of, the, old, paisaci, poem, kath, sarits, gara, is, considered, to, have, better, charm, of, language, elegance, of, style, masterly, arrangement, and, metrical, skill, also, k, emendra, s, collection, is, a, third, the, length, of, the, kath, sarits, gara, the, printed, text, amounting, to, a, little, more, than, 7, 561, slokas, in, 1871, professor, b, hler, indian, antiquary, p, 302, et, seq, proved, two, important, facts, firstly, that, somadeva, and, k, emendra, used, the, same, text, and, secondly, that, they, worked, entirely, independently, from, one, another, a, b, hatkath, such, as, the, two, writers, reproduced, a, prose, work, in, the, pai, c, dialect, existed, therefore, in, kashmir, but, it, was, no, longer, the, book, which, gu, hya, had, composed, it, was, a, huge, compilation, incorporating, not, only, many, particular, stories, from, heterogeneous, sources, but, even, whole, books, such, as, the, pa, catantra, the, vet, lapa, cavi, ati, and, the, story, of, nala, the, charge, of, abridging, obscuring, and, dislocating, the, main, narrative, is, valid, not, against, somadeva, and, k, emendra, but, against, predecessors, whose, work, of, amplification, had, been, completed, so, far, as, completion, can, be, predicated, perhaps, two, or, three, centuries, earlier, apart, from, the, kashmir, redactions, there, exists, a, sanskrit, version, of, gu, hya, s, work, bearing, the, title, b, hatkath, lokasa, graha, i, e, the, great, tale, verse, epitome, only, about, six, of, the, twenty, six, l, bhas, are, currently, available, its, discoverer, and, editor, m, f, lix, lac, te, had, published, essai, sur, gu, hya, et, la, b, hatkath, paris, 1908, along, with, the, text, an, elaborate, discussion, of, all, the, questions, of, higher, criticism, relating, to, the, kath, sarits, gara, and, the, other, recensions, m, lac, te, s, conclusions, which, are, developed, with, great, perspicacity, may, be, summarised, as, follows, the, manuscript, came, from, nepal, the, work, of, a, nepalese, writer, by, name, budhasv, min, it, is, dated, to, the, eighth, to, the, ninth, century, ce, and, is, based, upon, the, pai, ci, original, it, lacks, many, of, the, subsidiary, tales, in, the, kath, sarits, gara, and, thus, the, main, narrative, stands, out, concerned, predominantly, with, the, actual, adventures, of, narav, hanadatta, a, hero, of, gu, hya, s, own, invention, kath, sarits, gara, was, translated, into, persian, in, kashmir, during, the, reign, of, zayn, al, abidin, r, 1418, 20, 1470, under, the, name, of, bahr, al, asmar, ocean, of, stories, nowadays, this, version, is, not, extant, it, is, known, solely, through, the, evidence, from, other, sources, a, likely, reference, to, it, can, be, found, in, the, rajatarangini, by, r, vara, fl, 1459, 1505, r, vara, the, poet, laureate, at, the, court, refers,
