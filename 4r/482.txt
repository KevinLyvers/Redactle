art, of, central, asia, art, of, east, asia, art, of, south, asia, art, of, southeast, asia, art, of, europe, art, of, africa, art, of, the, americas, art, of, oceania, hellenistic, art, is, the, art, of, the, hellenistic, period, generally, taken, to, begin, with, the, death, of, alexander, the, great, in, 323, bc, and, end, with, the, conquest, of, the, greek, world, by, the, romans, a, process, well, underway, by, 146, bc, when, the, greek, mainland, was, taken, and, essentially, ending, in, 30, bc, with, the, conquest, of, ptolemaic, egypt, following, the, battle, of, actium, a, number, of, the, best, known, works, of, greek, sculpture, belong, to, this, period, including, laoco, n, and, his, sons, venus, de, milo, and, the, winged, victory, of, samothrace, it, follows, the, period, of, classical, greek, art, while, the, succeeding, greco, roman, art, was, very, largely, a, continuation, of, hellenistic, trends, the, term, hellenistic, refers, to, the, expansion, of, greek, influence, and, dissemination, of, its, ideas, following, the, death, of, alexander, the, hellenizing, of, the, world, with, koine, greek, as, a, common, language, the, term, is, a, modern, invention, the, hellenistic, world, not, only, included, a, huge, area, covering, the, whole, of, the, aegean, sea, rather, than, the, classical, greece, focused, on, the, poleis, of, athens, and, sparta, but, also, a, huge, time, range, in, artistic, terms, this, means, that, there, is, huge, variety, which, is, often, put, under, the, heading, of, hellenistic, art, for, convenience, one, of, the, defining, characteristics, of, the, hellenistic, period, was, the, division, of, alexander, s, empire, into, smaller, dynastic, empires, founded, by, the, diadochi, alexander, s, generals, who, became, regents, of, different, regions, the, ptolemies, in, egypt, the, seleucids, in, mesopotamia, persia, and, syria, the, attalids, in, pergamon, etc, each, of, these, dynasties, practiced, a, royal, patronage, which, differed, from, those, of, the, city, states, in, alexander, s, entourage, were, three, artists, lysippus, the, sculptor, apelles, the, painter, and, pyrgoteles, the, gem, cutter, and, engraver, the, period, after, his, death, was, one, of, great, prosperity, and, considerable, extravagance, for, much, of, the, greek, world, at, least, for, the, wealthy, royalty, became, important, patrons, of, art, sculpture, painting, and, architecture, thrived, but, vase, painting, ceased, to, be, of, great, significance, metalwork, and, a, wide, variety, of, luxury, arts, produced, much, fine, art, some, types, of, popular, art, were, increasingly, sophisticated, there, has, been, a, trend, in, writing, history, to, depict, hellenistic, art, as, a, decadent, style, following, the, golden, age, of, classical, greece, the, 18th, century, terms, baroque, and, rococo, have, sometimes, been, applied, to, the, art, of, this, complex, and, individual, period, a, renewed, interest, in, historiography, as, well, as, some, recent, discoveries, such, as, the, tombs, of, vergina, may, allow, a, better, appreciation, of, the, period, in, the, architectural, field, the, dynasties, following, hector, resulted, in, vast, urban, plans, and, large, complexes, which, had, mostly, disappeared, from, city, states, by, the, 5th, century, bc, the, doric, temple, was, virtually, abandoned, this, city, planning, was, quite, innovative, for, the, greek, world, rather, than, manipulating, space, by, correcting, its, faults, building, plans, conformed, to, the, natural, setting, one, notes, the, appearance, of, many, places, of, amusement, and, leisure, notably, the, multiplication, of, theatres, and, parks, the, hellenistic, monarchies, were, advantaged, in, this, regard, in, that, they, often, had, vast, spaces, where, they, could, build, large, cities, such, as, antioch, pergamon, and, seleucia, on, the, tigris, it, was, the, time, of, gigantism, thus, it, was, for, the, second, temple, of, apollo, at, didyma, situated, twenty, kilometers, from, miletus, in, ionia, it, was, designed, by, daphnis, of, miletus, and, paionios, of, ephesus, at, the, end, of, the, fourth, century, bc, but, the, construction, never, completed, was, carried, out, up, until, the, 2nd, century, ad, the, sanctuary, is, one, of, the, largest, ever, constructed, in, the, mediterranean, region, inside, a, vast, court, 21, 7, metres, by, 53, 6, metres, the, cella, is, surrounded, by, a, double, colonnade, of, 108, ionic, columns, nearly, 20, metres, tall, with, richly, sculpted, bases, and, capitals, hellenistic, alexandria, originated, a, distinctive, architectural, form, language, that, is, often, referred, to, as, baroque, due, to, its, liberal, use, of, ornamentation, and, its, repurposing, of, structural, elements, as, ornamental, elements, perhaps, partly, inspired, by, traditional, egyptian, architecture, alexandrian, architects, developed, new, shapes, such, as, segmental, broken, hollow, and, volute, pediments, and, curved, arched, concave, and, broken, entablatures, these, baroque, shapes, seem, to, have, existed, in, alexandria, at, least, by, the, 2nd, century, bc, many, of, them, were, later, adopted, across, the, roman, empire, and, also, significantly, influenced, the, rock, cut, tombs, of, petra, alexandrian, architecture, also, made, heavy, use, of, corinthian, capitals, both, on, exteriors, and, interiors, the, earliest, known, example, of, a, corinthian, exterior, in, alexandria, is, ptolemy, iii, s, temple, of, sarapis, in, the, sarapeion, which, was, constructed, sometime, between, 246, 221, bc, though, the, propylon, of, the, sanctuary, of, the, great, gods, on, samothrace, which, was, sponsored, by, ptolemy, ii, sometime, between, 285, 246, bc, also, already, featured, corinthian, columns, on, one, of, its, facades, corinthian, capitals, were, sometimes, paired, with, doric, entablatures, a, combination, that, was, rarely, seen, elsewhere, in, the, hellenistic, world, alexandrian, corinthian, capitals, exhibited, a, large, variety, of, shapes, and, compositions, which, historians, have, divided, into, four, distinct, types, other, typical, features, of, hellenistic, alexandrian, architecture, were, acanthus, leaf, column, bases, which, were, sometimes, inserted, between, the, standard, attic, column, base, and, the, column, shaft, of, a, corinthian, column, and, cornices, featuring, the, distinctive, alexandrian, flat, grooved, and, or, hollow, square, modillions, roman, second, style, frescoes, are, thought, to, be, inspired, by, alexandrian, architecture, the, ancient, city, of, olynthus, was, one, of, the, architectural, and, artistic, keystones, in, establishing, a, connection, between, the, classical, and, hellenistic, worlds, over, 100, homes, were, found, at, the, olynthus, city, site, interestingly, the, homes, and, other, architecture, were, incredibly, well, preserved, this, allows, us, to, better, understand, the, activities, that, took, place, in, the, homes, and, how, space, inside, the, homes, was, organized, and, utilized, homes, in, olynthus, were, typically, squarer, in, shape, the, desired, home, was, not, necessarily, large, or, extravagant, but, rather, comfortable, and, practical, this, was, a, mark, of, civilization, that, was, extremely, prominent, in, greek, culture, during, the, hellenistic, period, and, beyond, living, a, civilized, life, involved, maintaining, a, sturdy, living, space, thus, many, brick, like, materials, were, used, in, the, construction, of, the, homes, stone, wood, mudbrick, and, other, materials, were, commonly, used, to, build, these, dwellings, another, element, that, was, increasingly, popular, during, the, hellenistic, period, was, the, addition, of, a, courtyard, to, the, home, courtyards, served, as, a, light, source, for, the, home, as, greek, houses, were, closed, off, from, the, outside, to, maintain, a, level, of, privacy, there, have, been, windows, found, at, some, home, sites, but, they, are, typically, high, off, the, ground, and, small, because, of, the, issue, of, privacy, many, individuals, were, forced, to, compromise, on, light, in, the, home, well, lit, spaces, were, used, for, entertaining, or, more, public, activity, while, the, private, sectors, of, the, home, were, dark, and, closed, off, which, complicated, housework, courtyards, were, typically, the, focus, of, the, home, as, they, provided, a, space, for, entertaining, and, a, source, of, light, from, the, very, interior, of, the, home, they, were, paved, with, cobblestones, or, pebbles, most, often, but, there, have, been, discoveries, of, mosaicked, courtyards, mosaics, were, a, wonderful, way, for, the, family, to, express, their, interests, and, beliefs, as, well, as, a, way, to, add, d, cor, to, the, home, and, make, it, more, visually, appealing, this, artistic, touch, to, homes, at, olynthus, introduces, another, element, of, civilized, living, to, this, hellenistic, society, pergamon, in, particular, is, a, characteristic, example, of, hellenistic, architecture, starting, from, a, simple, fortress, located, on, the, acropolis, the, various, attalid, kings, set, up, a, colossal, architectural, complex, the, buildings, are, fanned, out, around, the, acropolis, to, take, into, account, the, nature, of, the, terrain, the, agora, located, to, the, south, on, the, lowest, terrace, is, bordered, by, galleries, with, colonnades, columns, or, stoai, it, is, the, beginning, of, a, street, which, crosses, the, entire, acropolis, it, separates, the, administrative, political, and, military, buildings, on, the, east, and, top, of, the, rock, from, the, sanctuaries, to, the, west, at, mid, height, among, which, the, most, prominent, is, that, which, shelters, the, monumental, pergamon, altar, known, as, of, the, twelve, gods, or, of, the, gods, and, of, the, giants, one, of, the, masterpieces, of, greek, sculpture, a, colossal, theatre, able, to, contain, nearly, 10, 000, spectators, has, benches, embedded, in, the, flanks, of, the, hill, pliny, the, elder, after, having, described, the, sculpture, of, the, classical, period, notes, cessavit, deinde, ars, then, art, disappeared, according, to, pliny, s, assessment, sculpture, declined, significantly, after, the, 121st, olympiad, 296, 293, bc, a, period, of, stagnation, followed, with, a, brief, revival, after, the, 156th, 156, 153, bc, but, with, nothing, to, the, standard, of, the, times, preceding, it, during, this, period, sculpture, became, more, naturalistic, and, also, expressive, there, is, an, interest, in, depicting, extremes, of, emotion, on, top, of, anatomical, realism, the, hellenistic, artist, seeks, to, represent, the, character, of, his, subject, including, themes, such, as, suffering, sleep, or, old, age, genre, subjects, of, common, people, women, children, animals, and, domestic, scenes, became, acceptable, subjects, for, sculpture, which, was, commissioned, by, wealthy, families, for, the, adornment, of, their, homes, and, gardens, the, boy, with, thorn, is, an, example, realistic, portraits, of, men, and, women, of, all, ages, were, produced, and, sculptors, no, longer, felt, obliged, to, depict, people, as, ideals, of, beauty, or, physical, perfection, the, world, of, dionysus, a, pastoral, idyll, populated, by, satyrs, maenads, nymphs, and, sileni, had, been, often, depicted, in, earlier, vase, painting, and, figurines, but, rarely, in, full, size, sculpture, the, old, drunkard, at, munich, portrays, without, reservation, an, old, woman, thin, haggard, clutching, against, herself, her, jar, of, wine, the, period, is, therefore, notable, for, its, portraits, one, such, is, the, barberini, faun, of, munich, which, represents, a, sleeping, satyr, with, relaxed, posture, and, anxious, face, perhaps, the, prey, of, nightmares, the, belvedere, torso, the, resting, satyr, the, furietti, centaurs, and, sleeping, hermaphroditus, reflect, similar, ideas, another, famous, hellenistic, portrait, is, that, of, demosthenes, by, polyeuktos, featuring, a, well, done, face, and, clasped, hands, another, phenomenon, of, the, hellenistic, age, appears, in, its, sculpture, privatization, seen, in, the, recapture, of, older, public, patterns, in, decorative, sculpture, portraiture, is, tinged, with, naturalism, under, the, influence, of, roman, art, new, hellenistic, cities, were, springing, up, all, over, egypt, syria, and, anatolia, which, required, statues, depicting, the, gods, and, heroes, of, greece, for, their, temples, and, public, places, this, made, sculpture, like, pottery, an, industry, with, the, consequent, standardization, and, some, lowering, of, quality, for, these, reasons, many, more, hellenistic, statues, have, survived, than, is, the, case, with, the, classical, period, hellenistic, sculpture, repeats, the, innovations, of, the, so, called, second, classicism, nude, sculpture, in, the, round, allowing, the, statue, to, be, admired, from, all, angles, study, of, draping, and, effects, of, transparency, of, clothing, and, the, suppleness, of, poses, thus, venus, de, milo, even, while, echoing, a, classic, model, is, distinguished, by, the, twist, of, her, hips, the, multi, figure, group, of, statues, was, a, hellenistic, innovation, probably, of, the, 3rd, century, taking, the, epic, battles, of, earlier, temple, pediment, reliefs, off, their, walls, and, placing, them, as, life, size, groups, of, statues, their, style, is, often, called, baroque, with, extravagantly, contorted, body, poses, and, intense, expressions, in, the, faces, the, laoco, n, group, detailed, below, is, considered, one, of, the, prototypical, examples, of, the, hellenistic, baroque, style, pergamon, did, not, distinguish, itself, with, its, architecture, alone, it, was, also, the, seat, of, a, brilliant, school, of, sculpture, known, as, pergamene, baroque, the, sculptors, imitating, the, preceding, centuries, portray, painful, moments, rendered, expressive, with, three, dimensional, compositions, often, v, shaped, and, anatomical, hyper, realism, the, barberini, faun, is, one, example, attalus, i, 269, 197, bc, to, commemorate, his, victory, at, caicus, against, the, gauls, called, galatians, by, the, greeks, had, two, series, of, votive, groups, sculpted, the, first, consecrated, on, the, acropolis, of, pergamon, includes, the, famous, gaul, killing, himself, and, his, wife, of, which, the, original, is, lost, the, second, group, offered, to, athens, is, composed, of, small, bronzes, of, greeks, amazons, gods, and, giants, persians, and, gauls, artemis, rospigliosi, in, the, louvre, is, probably, a, copy, of, one, of, them, as, for, copies, of, the, dying, gaul, they, were, very, numerous, in, the, roman, period, the, expression, of, sentiments, the, forcefulness, of, details, bushy, hair, and, moustaches, here, and, the, violence, of, the, movements, are, characteristic, of, the, pergamene, style, these, characteristics, are, pushed, to, their, peak, in, the, friezes, of, the, great, altar, of, pergamon, decorated, under, the, order, of, eumenes, ii, 197, 159, bc, with, a, gigantomachy, stretching, 110, metres, in, length, illustrating, in, the, stone, a, poem, composed, especially, for, the, court, the, olympians, triumph, in, it, each, on, his, side, over, giants, most, of, which, are, transformed, into, savage, beasts, serpents, birds, of, prey, lions, or, bulls, their, mother, gaia, comes, to, their, aid, but, can, do, nothing, and, must, watch, them, twist, in, pain, under, the, blows, of, the, gods, one, of, the, few, city, states, who, managed, to, maintain, full, independence, from, the, control, of, any, hellenistic, kingdom, was, rhodes, after, holding, out, for, one, year, under, siege, by, demetrius, poliorcetes, 305, 304, bc, the, rhodians, built, the, colossus, of, rhodes, to, commemorate, their, victory, with, a, height, of, 32, meters, it, was, one, of, the, seven, wonders, of, the, ancient, world, progress, in, bronze, casting, made, it, possible, for, the, greeks, to, create, large, works, many, of, the, large, bronze, statues, were, lost, with, the, majority, being, melted, to, recover, the, material, discovered, in, rome, in, 1506, and, seen, immediately, by, michelangelo, beginning, its, huge, influence, on, renaissance, and, baroque, art, laoco, n, strangled, by, snakes, tries, desperately, to, loosen, their, grip, without, affording, a, glance, at, his, dying, sons, the, group, is, one, of, very, few, non, architectural, ancient, sculptures, that, can, be, identified, with, those, mentioned, by, ancient, writers, it, is, attributed, by, pliny, the, elder, to, the, rhodian, sculptors, agesander, athenodoros, and, polydorus, johann, joachim, winckelmann, who, first, articulated, the, difference, between, greek, greco, roman, and, roman, art, drew, inspiration, from, the, laoco, n, gotthold, ephraim, lessing, based, many, of, the, ideas, in, his, laocoon, 1766, on, winckelmann, s, views, on, harmony, and, expression, in, the, visual, arts, the, fragmentary, sperlonga, sculptures, are, another, series, of, baroque, sculptures, in, the, hellenistic, style, perhaps, made, for, the, emperor, tiberius, who, was, certainly, present, at, the, collapse, of, the, seaside, grotto, in, southern, italy, that, they, decorated, the, inscriptions, suggest, the, same, sculptors, made, it, who, made, the, laoco, n, group, or, possibly, their, relations, the, baroque, traits, in, hellenistic, art, predominately, sculpture, have, been, contrasted, with, a, contemporary, trend, that, has, been, described, as, rococo, the, concept, of, a, hellenistic, rococo, was, coined, by, wilhelm, klein, in, the, early, 20th, century, unlike, the, dramatic, baroque, sculptures, the, rococo, trend, emphasized, playfull, motifs, such, as, satyrs, and, nymphs, wilhelm, klein, considered, the, sculpture, group, the, invitation, to, the, dance, to, be, a, prime, example, of, the, trend, also, lighthearted, depictions, of, aphrodite, the, goddess, of, love, and, eros, were, seen, as, typical, as, seen, for, instance, in, the, so, called, slipper, slapper, group, depicted, below, it, has, later, been, argued, that, the, preference, for, the, rococo, motifs, in, hellenistic, sculpture, can, be, tied, to, a, changed, use, of, sculpture, in, general, private, sculpture, collecting, became, more, common, during, the, later, hellenistic, period, and, in, such, collections, there, seems, to, have, been, a, preference, for, the, kinds, of, motifs, characterized, as, rococo, from, the, 2nd, century, the, neo, attic, or, neo, classical, style, is, seen, by, different, scholars, as, either, a, reaction, to, baroque, excesses, returning, to, a, version, of, classical, style, or, as, a, continuation, of, the, traditional, style, for, cult, statues, workshops, in, the, style, became, mainly, producers, of, copies, for, the, roman, market, which, preferred, copies, of, classical, rather, than, hellenistic, pieces, paintings, and, mosaics, were, important, mediums, in, art, but, no, examples, of, paintings, on, panels, have, survived, the, fall, to, the, romans, it, is, possible, to, get, some, idea, of, what, they, were, like, from, related, media, and, what, seem, to, be, copies, of, or, loose, derivations, from, paintings, in, a, wider, range, of, materials, perhaps, the, most, striking, element, of, hellenistic, paintings, and, mosaics, is, the, increased, use, of, landscape, landscapes, in, these, works, of, art, are, representative, of, familiar, naturalistic, figures, while, also, displaying, mythological, and, sacro, idyllic, elements, landscape, friezes, and, mosaics, were, commonly, used, to, display, scenes, from, hellenistic, poetry, such, as, that, by, herondas, and, theocritos, these, landscapes, that, expressed, the, stories, of, hellenistic, writers, were, utilized, in, the, home, to, emphasize, that, family, s, education, and, knowledge, about, the, literary, world, sacro, idyllic, means, that, the, most, prominent, elements, of, the, artwork, are, those, related, to, sacred, and, pastoral, themes, this, style, that, emerged, most, prevalently, in, hellenistic, art, combines, sacred, and, profane, elements, creating, a, dreamlike, setting, sacro, idyllic, influences, are, conveyed, in, the, roman, mosaic, nile, mosaic, of, palestrina, which, demonstrates, fantastical, narratives, with, a, color, scheme, and, commonplace, components, that, illustrate, the, nile, in, its, passage, from, ethiopia, to, the, mediterranean, the, inclusion, of, hellenistic, backgrounds, can, also, be, seen, in, works, throughout, pompeii, cyrene, alexandria, moreover, specifically, in, southern, russia, floral, features, and, branches, can, be, found, on, walls, and, ceilings, strewn, in, a, disordered, yet, conventional, manner, mirroring, a, late, greek, style, in, addition, cubiculum, paintings, found, in, villa, boscoreale, include, vegetation, and, a, rocky, setting, in, the, background, of, detailed, paintings, of, grand, architecture, wall, paintings, began, appearing, more, prominently, in, the, pompeian, period, these, wall, paintings, were, not, just, displayed, in, places, of, worship, or, in, tombs, often, wall, paintings, were, used, to, decorate, the, home, wall, paintings, were, common, in, private, homes, in, delos, priene, thera, pantikapaion, olbia, and, alexandria, few, examples, of, greek, wall, paintings, have, survived, the, centuries, the, most, impressive, in, terms, of, showing, what, high, quality, greek, painting, was, like, are, those, at, the, macedonian, royal, tombs, at, vergina, though, greek, painters, are, given, tribute, to, bringing, fundamental, ways, of, representation, to, the, western, world, through, their, art, three, main, qualities, unique, to, hellenistic, painting, style, were, three, dimensional, perspective, the, use, of, light, and, shade, to, render, form, and, trompe, l, il, realism, very, few, forms, of, hellenistic, greek, painting, survive, except, for, wooden, pinakes, panels, and, those, painted, on, stone, the, most, famously, known, stone, paintings, are, found, on, the, macedonian, tomb, at, agios, athanasios, researchers, have, been, limited, to, studying, the, hellenistic, influences, in, roman, frescoes, for, example, those, of, pompeii, or, herculaneum, in, addition, some, of, the, paintings, in, villa, boscoreale, clearly, echo, lost, hellenistic, macedonian, royal, paintings, recent, excavations, from, the, mediterranean, have, revealed, the, technology, used, in, hellenistic, painting, wall, art, of, this, period, utilized, two, techniques, secco, technique, and, fresco, technique, fresco, technique, required, layers, of, lime, rich, plaster, to, then, decorate, walls, and, stone, supports, on, the, other, hand, no, base, was, necessary, for, the, secco, technique, which, used, gum, arabic, and, egg, tempera, to, paint, finalizing, details, on, marble, or, other, stone, this, technique, is, exemplified, in, the, masonry, friezes, found, in, delos, both, techniques, used, mediums, that, were, locally, accessible, such, as, terracotta, aggregates, in, the, base, layers, and, natural, inorganic, pigments, synthetic, inorganic, pigments, and, organic, substances, as, colorants, recent, discoveries, include, those, of, chamber, tombs, in, vergina, 1987, in, the, former, kingdom, of, macedonia, where, many, friezes, have, been, unearthed, for, example, in, tomb, ii, archaeologists, found, a, hellenistic, style, frieze, depicting, a, lion, hunt, this, frieze, found, in, the, tomb, supposedly, that, of, philip, ii, is, remarkable, by, its, composition, the, arrangement, of, the, figures, in, space, and, its, realistic, representation, of, nature, other, friezes, maintain, a, realistic, narrative, such, as, a, symposium, and, banquet, or, a, military, escort, and, possibly, retell, historical, events, there, is, also, the, recently, restored, 1st, century, nabataean, ceiling, frescoes, in, the, painted, house, at, little, petra, in, jordan, as, the, nabataeans, traded, with, the, romans, egyptians, and, greeks, insects, and, other, animals, observed, in, the, paintings, reflect, hellenism, while, various, types, of, vines, are, associated, with, the, greek, god, dionysus, recent, archaeological, discoveries, at, the, cemetery, of, pagasae, close, to, modern, volos, at, the, edge, of, the, pagasetic, gulf, have, brought, to, light, some, original, works, the, excavations, of, this, site, led, by, dr, arvanitopoulos, may, be, connected, to, various, greek, painters, in, the, 3rd, and, 4th, centuries, and, depict, scenes, that, allude, to, the, reign, of, alexander, the, great, in, the, 1960s, a, group, of, wall, paintings, was, found, on, delos, it, is, evident, that, the, fragments, of, friezes, found, were, created, by, a, community, of, painters, who, lived, during, the, late, hellenistic, period, the, murals, emphasized, domestic, decoration, conveying, the, belief, these, people, held, that, the, delian, establishment, would, remain, stable, and, secure, enough, for, this, artwork, to, be, enjoyed, by, homeowners, for, many, years, to, come, certain, mosaics, however, provide, a, pretty, good, idea, of, the, grand, painting, of, the, period, these, are, copies, of, frescoes, this, art, form, has, been, used, to, decorate, primarily, walls, floors, and, columns, the, development, of, mosaic, art, during, the, hellenistic, period, began, with, pebble, mosaics, best, represented, in, the, site, of, olynthos, from, 5th, century, bc, the, technique, of, pebble, mosaics, consisted, of, placing, small, white, and, black, pebbles, of, no, specific, shape, in, a, circular, or, rectangular, panel, to, illustrate, scenes, of, mythology, the, white, pebbles, in, slightly, different, shades, were, placed, on, a, black, or, blue, background, to, create, the, image, the, black, pebbles, served, to, outline, the, image, in, the, mosaics, from, the, site, of, pella, from, the, 4th, century, bc, it, is, possible, to, see, a, more, evolved, form, of, the, art, mosaics, from, this, site, display, the, use, of, pebbles, that, were, shaded, in, a, wider, range, of, colors, and, tones, they, also, show, early, use, of, terra, cotta, and, lead, wire, to, create, a, greater, definition, of, contours, and, details, to, the, images, in, the, mosaics, following, this, example, more, materials, were, gradually, added, examples, of, this, extended, use, of, materials, in, mosaics, of, the, 3rd, century, bc, include, finely, cut, stones, chipped, pebbles, glass, and, baked, clay, known, as, tesserae, this, improved, the, technique, of, mosaics, by, aiding, the, artists, in, creating, more, definition, greater, detail, a, better, fit, and, an, even, wider, range, of, colors, and, tones, despite, the, chronological, order, of, the, appearance, of, these, techniques, there, is, no, actual, evidence, to, suggest, that, the, tessellated, necessarily, developed, from, the, pebble, mosaics, opus, vermiculatum, and, opus, tessellatum, were, two, different, techniques, used, during, this, period, of, mosaic, making, opus, tessellatum, refers, to, a, redacted, tessera, a, small, block, of, stone, tile, glass, or, other, material, used, in, the, construction, of, a, mosaic, size, followed, by, an, increased, variety, in, shape, color, and, material, as, well, as, andamento, or, the, pattern, in, which, the, tessera, was, laid, opus, vermiculatum, is, oftentimes, partnered, with, this, technique, but, differs, in, complexity, and, is, known, to, have, the, highest, visual, impact, the, majority, of, mosaics, were, produced, and, laid, on, site, however, a, number, of, floor, mosaics, display, the, use, of, the, emblemata, technique, in, which, panels, of, the, image, are, created, off, site, in, trays, of, terra, cotta, or, stone, these, trays, were, later, placed, into, the, setting, bed, on, the, site, at, delos, colored, grouts, were, used, on, opus, vermiculatum, mosaics, but, in, other, regions, this, is, not, common, there, is, one, example, of, colored, grout, used, in, alexandria, on, the, dog, and, askos, mosaic, at, samos, the, grouts, and, the, tesserae, are, both, colored, studying, color, here, is, difficult, as, the, grouts, are, extremely, fragile, and, vulnerable, scientifics, research, has, been, a, source, of, interesting, information, with, regard, to, the, grouts, and, tesserae, used, in, hellenistic, mosaics, lead, strips, were, discovered, on, mosaics, as, a, definiting, characteristic, of, the, surface, technique, lead, strips, are, absent, from, the, mosaics, here, at, delos, lead, strips, were, common, on, mosaics, in, the, opus, tessellatum, style, these, strips, were, used, to, outline, decorative, borders, and, geometric, decorative, motifs, the, strips, were, extremely, common, on, opus, vermiculatum, mosaics, from, alexandria, because, lead, strips, were, present, in, both, styles, of, surface, types, they, cannot, be, the, sole, characteristic, of, one, type, or, the, other, a, rare, example, of, virtuoso, hellenistic, style, picture, mosaic, found, in, the, levantine, coast, through, a, technical, analysis, of, the, mosaic, researchers, suggest, that, this, mosaic, was, created, by, itinerant, craftsman, working, in, situ, since, 2000, over, 200, fragments, of, the, mosaic, have, been, discovered, at, the, headline, of, tel, dor, however, the, destruction, of, the, original, mosaic, is, unknown, excavators, suggest, that, earthquake, or, urban, renewal, is, the, cause, original, architectural, context, is, unknown, but, stylistic, and, technical, comparisons, suggest, a, late, hellenistic, period, date, estimating, around, the, second, half, of, the, second, century, b, c, e, analyzing, the, fragments, found, at, the, original, site, researchers, have, found, that, the, original, mosaic, contained, a, centralized, rectangle, with, unknown, iconography, surrounded, by, a, series, of, decorative, borders, consisting, of, a, perspective, meander, followed, by, a, mask, and, garland, border, this, mosaic, consists, of, two, different, techniques, of, mosaic, making, opus, vermiculatum, and, opus, tessellatum, an, example, is, the, alexander, mosaic, showing, the, confrontation, of, the, young, conqueror, and, the, grand, king, darius, iii, at, the, battle, of, issus, a, mosaic, from, a, floor, in, the, house, of, the, faun, at, pompeii, now, in, naples, it, is, believed, to, be, a, copy, of, a, painting, described, by, pliny, which, had, been, painted, by, philoxenus, of, eretria, for, king, cassander, of, macedon, at, the, end, of, the, 4th, century, bc, or, even, of, a, painting, by, apelles, contemporaneous, with, alexander, himself, the, mosaic, allows, us, to, admire, the, choice, of, colors, along, with, the, composition, of, the, ensemble, using, turning, movement, and, facial, expression, the, stag, hunt, mosaic, by, gnosis, is, a, mosaic, from, a, wealthy, home, of, the, late, 4th, century, bc, the, so, called, house, of, the, abduction, of, helen, or, house, of, the, rape, of, helen, in, pella, the, signature, gnosis, epoesen, i, e, gnosis, created, is, the, first, known, signature, of, a, mosaicist, the, emblema, is, bordered, by, an, intricate, floral, pattern, which, itself, is, bordered, by, stylized, depictions, of, waves, the, mosaic, is, a, pebble, mosaic, with, stones, collected, from, beaches, and, riverbanks, which, were, set, into, cement, as, was, perhaps, often, the, case, the, mosaic, does, much, to, reflect, styles, of, painting, the, light, figures, against, a, darker, background, may, allude, to, red, figure, painting, the, mosaic, also, uses, shading, known, to, the, greeks, as, skiagraphia, in, its, depictions, of, the, musculature, and, cloaks, of, the, figures, this, along, with, its, use, of, overlapping, figures, to, create, depth, renders, the, image, three, dimensional, the, hellenistic, period, is, equally, the, time, of, development, of, the, mosaic, as, such, particularly, with, the, works, of, sosos, of, pergamon, active, in, the, 2nd, century, bc, and, the, only, mosaic, artist, cited, by, pliny, his, taste, for, trompe, l, il, optical, illusion, and, the, effects, of, the, medium, are, found, in, several, works, attributed, to, him, such, as, the, unswept, floor, in, the, vatican, museum, representing, the, leftovers, of, a, repast, fish, bones, bones, empty, shells, etc, and, the, dove, basin, made, of, small, opus, vermiculatum, tesserae, stones, at, the, capitoline, museum, known, by, means, of, a, reproduction, discovered, in, hadrian, s, villa, in, it, one, sees, four, doves, perched, on, the, edge, of, a, gilt, bronze, basin, filled, with, water, one, of, them, is, watering, herself, while, the, others, seem, to, be, resting, which, creates, effects, of, reflections, and, shadow, perfectly, studied, by, the, artist, the, dove, basin, mosaic, panel, is, an, emblema, designed, to, be, the, central, point, of, an, otherwise, plain, mosaic, floor, the, emblema, was, originally, an, import, from, the, hellenistic, eastern, mediterranean, where, in, cities, such, as, pergamom, ephesus, and, alexandria, there, were, artists, specializing, in, mosaics, one, of, them, was, sosos, of, pergamon, the, most, celebrated, mosaicist, of, antiquity, who, worked, in, the, second, century, bc, according, to, the, french, archaeologist, fran, ois, chamoux, the, mosaics, of, delos, in, the, cyclades, represent, the, zenith, of, hellenistic, period, mosaic, art, employing, the, use, of, tesserae, to, form, complex, colorful, scenes, this, style, of, mosaic, continued, until, the, end, of, antiquity, and, may, have, had, an, impact, on, the, widespread, use, of, mosaics, in, the, western, world, during, the, middle, ages, the, hellenistic, age, comes, immediately, after, the, great, age, of, painted, ancient, greek, pottery, perhaps, because, increased, prosperity, led, to, more, use, of, fine, metalware, very, little, now, surviving, and, the, decline, of, the, fine, painted, vase, the, term, used, for, all, vessel, shapes, in, pottery, most, vases, of, the, period, are, black, and, uniform, with, a, shiny, appearance, approaching, that, of, varnish, decorated, with, simple, motifs, of, flowers, or, festoons, the, shapes, of, the, vessels, are, often, based, on, metalwork, shapes, thus, with, the, lagynos, a, wine, jar, typical, of, the, period, painted, vase, types, that, continued, production, into, the, hellenistic, period, include, hadra, vases, and, panathenaic, amphora, it, is, also, the, period, of, so, called, megarian, ware, mold, made, vases, with, decoration, in, relief, appeared, doubtless, in, imitation, of, vases, made, of, precious, metals, wreaths, in, relief, were, applied, to, the, body, of, the, vase, one, finds, also, more, complex, relief, based, on, animals, or, legendary, creatures, red, figure, painting, had, died, out, in, athens, by, the, end, of, the, 4th, century, bc, to, be, replaced, by, what, is, known, as, west, slope, ware, so, named, after, the, finds, on, the, west, slope, of, the, athenian, acropolis, this, consisted, of, painting, in, a, tan, coloured, slip, and, white, paint, on, a, fired, black, slip, background, with, some, incised, detailing, representations, of, people, diminished, replaced, with, simpler, motifs, such, as, wreaths, dolphins, rosettes, etc, variations, of, this, style, spread, throughout, the, greek, world, with, notable, centres, in, crete, and, apulia, where, figural, scenes, continued, to, be, in, demand, gnathia, vases, however, were, still, produced, not, only, in, apulian, but, also, in, campanian, paestan, and, sicilian, vase, painting, in, canosa, di, puglia, in, south, italy, in, 3rd, century, bc, burials, one, might, find, vases, with, fully, three, dimensional, attachments, the, distinguishing, feature, of, canosa, vases, are, the, water, soluble, paints, blue, red, yellow, light, purple, and, brown, paints, were, applied, to, a, white, ground, the, centuripe, ware, of, sicily, which, has, been, called, the, last, gasp, of, greek, vase, painting, had, fully, coloured, tempera, painting, including, groups, of, figures, applied, after, firing, contrary, to, the, traditional, practice, the, fragility, of, the, pigments, prevented, frequent, use, of, these, vases, they, were, reserved, for, use, in, funerals, and, many, were, purely, for, display, for, example, with, lids, that, did, not, lift, off, the, practice, perhaps, continued, into, the, 2nd, century, bc, making, it, possibly, the, last, vase, painting, with, significant, figures, a, workshop, was, active, until, at, least, the, 3rd, century, bc, these, vases, are, characterized, by, a, base, painted, pink, the, figures, often, female, are, represented, in, coloured, clothing, blue, violet, chiton, yellow, himation, white, veil, the, style, is, reminiscent, of, pompeii, and, draws, more, from, grand, contemporary, paintings, than, on, the, heritage, of, the, red, figure, pottery, bricks, and, tiles, were, used, for, architectural, and, other, purposes, production, of, greek, terracotta, figurines, became, increasingly, important, terracotta, figurines, represented, divinities, as, well, as, subjects, from, contemporary, life, previously, reserved, for, religious, use, in, hellenistic, greece, the, terracotta, was, more, frequently, used, for, funerary, and, purely, decorative, purposes, the, refinement, of, molding, techniques, made, it, possible, to, create, true, miniature, statues, with, a, high, level, of, detail, typically, painted, several, greek, styles, continued, into, the, roman, period, and, greek, influence, partly, transmitted, via, the, ancient, etruscans, on, ancient, roman, pottery, was, considerable, especially, in, figurines, tanagra, figurines, from, tanagra, in, boeotia, and, other, centers, full, of, lively, colours, most, often, represent, elegant, women, in, scenes, full, of, charm, at, smyrna, in, asia, minor, two, major, styles, occurred, side, by, side, first, of, all, copies, of, masterpieces, of, great, sculpture, such, as, the, farnese, hercules, in, gilt, terracotta, in, a, completely, different, genre, there, are, the, grotesques, which, contrast, violently, with, the, canons, of, greek, beauty, the, koroplathos, figurine, maker, fashions, deformed, bodies, in, tortuous, poses, hunchbacks, epileptics, hydrocephalics, obese, women, etc, one, could, therefore, wonder, whether, these, were, medical, models, the, town, of, smyrna, being, reputed, for, its, medical, school, or, they, could, simply, be, caricatures, designed, to, provoke, laughter, the, grotesques, are, equally, common, at, tarsus, and, also, at, alexandria, one, theme, which, emerged, was, the, negro, particularly, in, ptolemaic, egypt, these, statuettes, of, black, adolescents, were, successful, up, to, the, roman, period, sometimes, they, were, reduced, to, echoing, a, form, from, the, great, sculptures, thus, one, finds, numerous, copies, in, miniature, of, the, tyche, fortune, or, chance, of, antioch, of, which, the, original, dates, to, the, beginning, of, the, 3rd, century, bc, hellenistic, pottery, designs, can, be, found, in, the, city, of, taxila, in, modern, pakistan, which, was, colonized, with, greek, artisans, and, potters, after, alexander, conquered, it, because, of, so, much, bronze, statue, melting, only, the, smaller, objects, still, exist, in, hellenistic, greece, the, raw, materials, were, plentiful, following, eastern, conquests, the, work, on, metal, vases, took, on, a, new, fullness, the, artists, competed, among, themselves, with, great, virtuosity, the, thracian, panagyurishte, treasure, from, modern, bulgaria, includes, greek, objects, such, as, a, gold, amphora, with, two, rearing, centaurs, forming, the, handles, the, derveni, krater, from, near, thessaloniki, is, a, large, bronze, volute, krater, from, about, 320, bc, weighing, 40, kilograms, and, finely, decorated, with, a, 32, centimetre, tall, frieze, of, figures, in, relief, representing, dionysus, surrounded, by, ariadne, and, her, procession, of, satyrs, and, maenads, the, neck, is, decorated, with, ornamental, motifs, while, four, satyrs, in, high, relief, are, casually, seated, on, the, shoulders, of, the, vase, the, evolution, is, similar, for, the, art, of, jewelry, the, jewelers, of, the, time, excelled, at, handling, details, and, filigrees, thus, the, funeral, wreaths, present, very, realistic, leaves, of, trees, or, stalks, of, wheat, in, this, period, the, insetting, of, precious, stones, flourished, it, was, in, the, hellenistic, period, that, the, greeks, who, until, then, only, knew, molded, glass, discovered, the, technique, of, glass, blowing, thus, permitting, new, forms, beginning, in, syria, the, art, of, glass, developed, especially, in, italy, molded, glass, continued, notably, in, the, creation, of, intaglio, jewelry, the, art, of, engraving, gems, hardly, advanced, at, all, limiting, itself, to, mass, produced, items, that, lacked, originality, as, compensation, the, cameo, made, its, appearance, it, concerns, cutting, in, relief, on, a, stone, composed, of, several, colored, layers, allowing, the, object, to, be, presented, in, relief, with, more, than, one, color, the, hellenistic, period, produced, some, masterpieces, like, the, gonzaga, cameo, now, in, the, hermitage, museum, and, spectacular, hardstone, carvings, like, the, cup, of, the, ptolemies, in, paris, coinage, in, the, hellenistic, period, increasingly, used, portraits, spurred, by, the, roman, acquisition, elite, consumption, and, demand, for, greek, art, both, greek, and, roman, artists, particularly, after, the, establishment, of, roman, greece, sought, to, reproduce, the, marble, and, bronze, artworks, of, the, classical, and, hellenistic, periods, they, did, so, by, creating, molds, of, original, sculptures, producing, plaster, casts, that, could, be, sent, to, any, sculptor, s, workshop, of, the, mediterranean, where, these, works, of, art, could, be, duplicated, these, were, often, faithful, reproductions, of, originals, yet, other, times, they, fused, several, elements, of, various, artworks, into, one, group, or, simply, added, roman, portraiture, heads, to, preexisting, athletic, greek, bodies
