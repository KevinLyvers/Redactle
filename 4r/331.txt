the, double, bass, d, b, l, b, e, s, also, known, as, the, upright, bass, the, acoustic, bass, or, simply, the, bass, is, the, largest, and, lowest, pitched, chordophone, in, the, modern, symphony, orchestra, excluding, rare, additions, such, as, the, octobass, similar, in, structure, to, the, cello, it, has, four, or, five, strings, the, bass, is, a, standard, member, of, the, orchestra, s, string, section, along, with, violins, violas, and, cellos, as, well, as, the, concert, band, and, is, featured, in, concertos, solo, and, chamber, music, in, western, classical, music, the, bass, is, used, in, a, range, of, other, genres, such, as, jazz, blues, rock, and, roll, rockabilly, country, music, bluegrass, tango, folk, music, and, certain, types, of, film, and, video, game, soundtracks, the, instrument, s, exact, lineage, is, still, a, matter, of, some, debate, with, scholars, divided, on, whether, the, bass, is, derived, from, the, viol, or, the, violin, family, being, a, transposing, instrument, the, bass, is, typically, notated, one, octave, higher, than, tuned, to, avoid, excessive, ledger, lines, below, the, staff, the, double, bass, is, the, only, modern, bowed, string, instrument, that, is, tuned, in, fourths, like, a, bass, guitar, viol, or, the, lowest, sounding, four, strings, of, a, standard, guitar, rather, than, fifths, with, strings, usually, tuned, to, e, 1, a, 1, d, 2, and, g, 2, the, double, bass, is, played, with, a, bow, arco, or, by, plucking, the, strings, pizzicato, or, via, a, variety, of, extended, techniques, in, orchestral, repertoire, and, tango, music, both, arco, and, pizzicato, are, employed, in, jazz, blues, and, rockabilly, pizzicato, is, the, norm, classical, music, and, jazz, use, the, natural, sound, produced, acoustically, by, the, instrument, as, does, traditional, bluegrass, in, funk, blues, reggae, and, related, genres, the, double, bass, is, often, amplified, a, person, who, plays, this, instrument, is, called, a, bassist, double, bassist, double, bass, player, contrabassist, contrabass, player, or, bass, player, the, names, contrabass, and, double, bass, refer, respectively, to, the, instrument, s, range, and, to, its, use, one, octave, lower, than, the, cello, i, e, the, cello, part, was, the, main, bass, line, and, the, double, bass, originally, played, a, copy, of, the, cello, part, only, later, was, it, given, an, independent, part, the, terms, for, the, instrument, among, classical, performers, are, contrabass, which, comes, from, the, instrument, s, italian, name, contrabbasso, string, bass, to, distinguish, it, from, brass, bass, instruments, in, a, concert, band, such, as, tubas, or, simply, bass, in, jazz, blues, rockabilly, and, other, genres, outside, of, classical, music, this, instrument, is, commonly, called, the, upright, bass, standup, bass, or, acoustic, bass, to, distinguish, it, from, the, usually, electric, bass, guitar, in, folk, and, bluegrass, music, the, instrument, is, also, referred, to, as, a, bass, fiddle, or, bass, violin, or, more, rarely, as, doghouse, bass, or, bull, fiddle, as, a, member, of, the, violin, family, of, instruments, the, construction, of, the, upright, bass, is, quite, different, from, that, of, the, acoustic, bass, guitar, as, the, latter, is, a, derivative, of, the, electric, bass, guitar, and, usually, built, like, a, larger, and, sturdier, variant, of, an, acoustic, guitar, the, double, bass, is, sometimes, confusingly, called, the, violone, bass, violin, or, bass, viol, a, typical, double, bass, stands, around, 180, cm, 6, feet, from, scroll, to, endpin, whereas, the, traditional, full, size, 4, 4, size, bass, stands, 74, 8, inches, 190, cm, the, more, common, 3, 4, size, bass, which, has, become, the, most, widely, used, size, in, the, modern, era, even, among, orchestral, players, stands, 71, 6, inches, 182, cm, from, scroll, to, endpin, other, sizes, are, also, available, such, as, a, 1, 2, size, or, 1, 4, size, which, serve, to, accommodate, a, player, s, height, and, hand, size, these, names, of, the, sizes, do, not, reflect, the, true, size, relative, to, a, full, size, bass, a, 1, 2, bass, is, not, half, the, length, of, a, 4, 4, bass, but, is, only, about, 15, smaller, double, basses, are, typically, constructed, from, several, types, of, wood, including, maple, for, the, back, spruce, for, the, top, and, ebony, for, the, fingerboard, it, is, uncertain, whether, the, instrument, is, a, descendant, of, the, viola, da, gamba, or, of, the, violin, but, it, is, traditionally, aligned, with, the, violin, family, while, the, double, bass, is, nearly, identical, in, construction, to, other, violin, family, instruments, it, also, embodies, features, found, in, the, older, viol, family, the, notes, of, the, open, strings, are, e, 1, a, 1, d, 2, and, g, 2, the, same, as, an, acoustic, or, electric, bass, guitar, however, the, resonance, of, the, wood, combined, with, the, violin, like, construction, and, long, scale, length, gives, the, double, bass, a, much, richer, tone, than, the, bass, guitar, in, addition, to, the, ability, to, use, a, bow, while, the, fretless, fingerboard, accommodates, smooth, glissandos, and, legatos, like, other, violin, and, viol, family, string, instruments, the, double, bass, is, played, either, with, a, bow, arco, or, by, plucking, the, strings, pizzicato, when, employing, a, bow, the, player, can, either, use, it, traditionally, or, strike, the, wood, of, the, bow, against, the, string, in, orchestral, repertoire, and, tango, music, both, arco, and, pizzicato, are, employed, in, jazz, blues, and, rockabilly, pizzicato, is, the, norm, except, for, some, solos, and, occasional, written, parts, in, modern, jazz, that, call, for, bowing, bowed, notes, in, the, lowest, register, of, the, instrument, produce, a, dark, heavy, mighty, or, even, menacing, effect, when, played, with, a, fortissimo, dynamic, however, the, same, low, pitches, played, with, a, delicate, pianissimo, can, create, a, sonorous, mellow, accompaniment, line, classical, bass, students, learn, all, of, the, different, bow, articulations, used, by, other, string, section, players, e, g, violin, and, cello, such, as, d, tach, legato, staccato, sforzato, martel, hammered, style, sul, ponticello, sul, tasto, tremolo, spiccato, and, sautill, some, of, these, articulations, can, be, combined, for, example, the, combination, of, sul, ponticello, and, tremolo, can, produce, eerie, ghostly, sounds, classical, bass, players, do, play, pizzicato, parts, in, orchestra, but, these, parts, generally, require, simple, notes, quarter, notes, half, notes, whole, notes, rather, than, rapid, passages, classical, players, perform, both, bowed, and, pizz, notes, using, vibrato, an, effect, created, by, rocking, or, quivering, the, left, hand, finger, that, is, contacting, the, string, which, then, transfers, an, undulation, in, pitch, to, the, tone, vibrato, is, used, to, add, expression, to, string, playing, in, general, very, loud, low, register, passages, are, played, with, little, or, no, vibrato, as, the, main, goal, with, low, pitches, is, to, provide, a, clear, fundamental, bass, for, the, string, section, mid, and, higher, register, melodies, are, typically, played, with, more, vibrato, the, speed, and, intensity, of, the, vibrato, is, varied, by, the, performer, for, an, emotional, and, musical, effect, in, jazz, rockabilly, and, other, related, genres, much, or, all, of, the, focus, is, on, playing, pizzicato, in, jazz, and, jump, blues, bassists, are, required, to, play, rapid, pizzicato, walking, basslines, for, extended, periods, jazz, and, rockabilly, bassists, develop, virtuoso, pizzicato, techniques, that, enable, them, to, play, rapid, solos, that, incorporate, fast, moving, triplet, and, sixteenth, note, figures, pizzicato, basslines, performed, by, leading, jazz, professionals, are, much, more, difficult, than, the, pizzicato, basslines, that, classical, bassists, encounter, in, the, standard, orchestral, literature, which, are, typically, whole, notes, half, notes, quarter, notes, and, occasional, eighth, note, passages, in, jazz, and, related, styles, bassists, often, add, semi, percussive, ghost, notes, into, basslines, to, add, to, the, rhythmic, feel, and, to, add, fills, to, a, bassline, the, double, bass, player, stands, or, sits, on, a, high, stool, and, leans, the, instrument, against, their, body, turned, slightly, inward, to, put, the, strings, comfortably, in, reach, this, stance, is, a, key, reason, for, the, bass, s, sloped, shoulders, which, mark, it, apart, from, the, other, members, of, the, violin, family, the, narrower, shoulders, facilitate, playing, the, strings, in, their, higher, registers, the, double, bass, is, generally, regarded, as, a, modern, descendant, of, bass, violin, a, member, of, the, chordophone, family, that, originated, in, europe, in, the, 15th, century, before, the, 20th, century, many, double, basses, had, only, three, strings, in, contrast, to, the, five, to, six, strings, typical, of, instruments, in, the, viol, family, or, the, four, strings, of, instruments, in, the, violin, family, the, double, bass, s, proportions, are, dissimilar, to, those, of, the, violin, and, cello, for, example, it, is, deeper, the, distance, from, front, to, back, is, proportionally, much, greater, than, the, violin, in, addition, while, the, violin, has, bulging, shoulders, most, double, basses, have, shoulders, carved, with, a, more, acute, slope, like, members, of, the, viol, family, many, very, old, double, basses, have, had, their, shoulders, cut, or, sloped, to, aid, playing, with, modern, techniques, before, these, modifications, the, design, of, their, shoulders, was, closer, to, instruments, of, the, violin, family, the, double, bass, is, the, only, modern, bowed, string, instrument, that, is, tuned, in, fourths, like, a, viol, rather, than, fifths, see, tuning, below, the, instrument, s, exact, lineage, is, still, a, matter, of, some, debate, and, the, supposition, that, the, double, bass, is, a, direct, descendant, of, the, viol, family, is, one, that, has, not, been, entirely, resolved, in, his, a, new, history, of, the, double, bass, paul, brun, asserts, that, the, double, bass, has, origins, as, the, true, bass, of, the, violin, family, he, states, that, while, the, exterior, of, the, double, bass, may, resemble, the, viola, da, gamba, the, internal, construction, of, the, double, bass, is, nearly, identical, to, instruments, in, the, violin, family, and, very, different, from, the, internal, structure, of, viols, double, bass, professor, larry, hurst, argues, that, the, modern, double, bass, is, not, a, true, member, of, either, the, violin, or, viol, families, he, says, that, most, likely, its, first, general, shape, was, that, of, a, violone, the, largest, member, of, the, viol, family, some, of, the, earliest, basses, extant, are, violones, including, c, shaped, sound, holes, that, have, been, fitted, with, modern, trappings, some, existing, instruments, such, as, those, by, gasparo, da, sal, were, converted, from, 16th, century, six, string, contrabass, violoni, there, are, two, major, approaches, to, the, design, outline, shape, of, the, double, bass, the, violin, form, shown, in, the, labelled, picture, in, the, construction, section, and, the, viola, da, gamba, form, shown, in, the, header, picture, of, this, article, a, third, less, common, design, called, the, busetto, shape, can, also, be, found, as, can, the, even, more, rare, guitar, or, pear, shape, the, back, of, the, instrument, can, vary, from, being, a, round, carved, back, similar, to, that, of, the, violin, to, a, flat, and, angled, back, similar, to, the, viol, family, the, double, bass, features, many, parts, that, are, similar, to, members, of, the, violin, family, including, a, wooden, carved, bridge, to, support, the, strings, two, f, holes, a, tailpiece, into, which, the, ball, ends, of, the, strings, are, inserted, with, the, tailpiece, anchored, around, the, endpin, mount, an, ornamental, scroll, near, the, pegbox, a, nut, with, grooves, for, each, string, at, the, junction, of, the, fingerboard, and, the, pegbox, and, a, sturdy, thick, sound, post, which, transmits, the, vibrations, from, the, top, of, the, instrument, to, the, hollow, body, and, supports, the, pressure, of, the, string, tension, unlike, the, rest, of, the, violin, family, the, double, bass, still, reflects, influences, and, can, be, considered, partly, derived, from, the, viol, family, of, instruments, in, particular, the, violone, the, lowest, pitched, and, largest, bass, member, of, the, viol, family, for, example, the, bass, is, tuned, in, fourths, like, a, viol, rather, than, in, fifths, which, is, the, standard, in, the, violin, group, also, notice, that, the, shoulders, meet, the, neck, in, a, curve, rather, than, the, sharp, angle, seen, among, violins, as, with, the, other, violin, and, viol, family, instruments, that, are, played, with, a, bow, and, unlike, mainly, plucked, or, picked, instruments, like, guitar, the, double, bass, s, bridge, has, an, arc, like, curved, shape, this, is, done, because, with, bowed, instruments, the, player, must, be, able, to, play, individual, strings, if, the, double, bass, were, to, have, a, flat, bridge, it, would, be, impossible, to, bow, the, a, and, d, strings, individually, the, double, bass, also, differs, from, members, of, the, violin, family, in, that, the, shoulders, are, typically, sloped, and, the, back, is, often, angled, both, to, allow, easier, access, to, the, instrument, particularly, in, the, upper, range, machine, tuners, are, always, fitted, in, contrast, to, the, rest, of, the, violin, family, where, traditional, wooden, friction, pegs, are, still, the, primary, means, of, tuning, lack, of, standardization, in, design, means, that, one, double, bass, can, sound, and, look, very, different, from, another, the, double, bass, is, closest, in, construction, to, violins, but, has, some, notable, similarities, to, the, violone, large, viol, the, largest, and, lowest, pitched, member, of, the, viol, family, unlike, the, violone, however, the, fingerboard, of, the, double, bass, is, unfretted, and, the, double, bass, has, fewer, strings, the, violone, like, most, viols, generally, had, six, strings, although, some, specimens, had, five, or, four, the, fingerboard, is, made, of, ebony, on, high, quality, instruments, on, less, expensive, student, instruments, other, woods, may, be, used, and, then, painted, or, stained, black, a, process, called, ebonizing, the, fingerboard, is, radiused, using, a, curve, for, the, same, reason, that, the, bridge, is, curved, if, the, fingerboard, and, bridge, were, to, be, flat, then, a, bassist, would, not, be, able, to, bow, the, inner, two, strings, individually, by, using, a, curved, bridge, and, a, curved, fingerboard, the, bassist, can, align, the, bow, with, any, of, the, four, strings, and, play, them, individually, unlike, the, violin, and, viola, but, like, the, cello, the, bass, fingerboard, is, somewhat, flattened, out, underneath, the, e, string, the, c, string, on, cello, this, is, commonly, known, as, a, romberg, bevel, the, vast, majority, of, fingerboards, cannot, be, adjusted, by, the, performer, any, adjustments, must, be, made, by, a, luthier, a, very, small, number, of, expensive, basses, for, professionals, have, adjustable, fingerboards, in, which, a, screw, mechanism, can, be, used, to, raise, or, lower, the, fingerboard, height, an, important, distinction, between, the, double, bass, and, other, members, of, the, violin, family, is, the, construction, of, the, pegbox, and, the, tuning, mechanism, while, the, violin, viola, and, cello, all, use, friction, pegs, for, tuning, adjustments, tightening, and, loosening, the, string, tension, to, raise, or, lower, the, string, s, pitch, the, double, bass, has, metal, machine, heads, and, gears, one, of, the, challenges, with, tuning, pegs, is, that, the, friction, between, the, wood, peg, and, the, peg, hole, may, become, insufficient, to, hold, the, peg, in, place, particularly, if, the, peg, hole, become, worn, and, enlarged, the, key, on, the, tuning, machine, of, a, double, bass, turns, a, metal, worm, which, drives, a, worm, gear, that, winds, the, string, turning, the, key, in, one, direction, tightens, the, string, thus, raising, its, pitch, turning, the, key, the, opposite, direction, reduces, the, tension, on, the, string, thus, lowering, its, pitch, while, this, development, makes, fine, tuners, on, the, tailpiece, important, for, violin, viola, and, cello, players, as, their, instruments, use, friction, pegs, for, major, pitch, adjustments, unnecessary, a, very, small, number, of, bassists, use, them, nevertheless, one, rationale, for, using, fine, tuners, on, bass, is, that, for, instruments, with, the, low, c, extension, the, pulley, system, for, the, long, string, may, not, effectively, transfer, turns, of, the, key, into, changes, of, string, tension, pitch, at, the, base, of, the, double, bass, is, a, metal, rod, with, a, spiked, or, rubberized, end, called, the, endpin, which, rests, on, the, floor, this, endpin, is, generally, thicker, and, more, robust, than, that, of, a, cello, because, of, the, greater, mass, of, the, instrument, the, materials, most, often, used, in, double, bass, construction, for, fully, carved, basses, the, type, used, by, professional, orchestra, bassists, and, soloists, are, maple, back, neck, ribs, spruce, top, and, ebony, fingerboard, tailpiece, the, tailpiece, may, be, made, from, other, types, of, wood, or, non, wood, materials, less, expensive, basses, are, typically, constructed, with, laminated, plywood, tops, backs, and, ribs, or, are, hybrid, models, produced, with, laminated, backs, and, sides, and, carved, solid, wood, tops, some, 2010, era, lower, to, mid, priced, basses, are, made, of, willow, student, models, constructed, of, fiberglass, were, produced, in, the, mid, 20th, century, and, some, typically, fairly, expensive, basses, have, been, constructed, of, carbon, fiber, laminated, plywood, basses, which, are, widely, used, in, music, schools, youth, orchestras, and, in, popular, and, folk, music, settings, including, rockabilly, psychobilly, blues, etc, are, very, resistant, to, humidity, and, heat, as, well, to, the, physical, abuse, they, are, apt, to, encounter, in, a, school, environment, or, for, blues, and, folk, musicians, to, the, hazards, of, touring, and, performing, in, bars, another, option, is, the, hybrid, body, bass, which, has, a, laminated, back, and, a, carved, or, solid, wood, top, it, is, less, costly, and, somewhat, less, fragile, at, least, regarding, its, back, than, a, fully, carved, bass, the, soundpost, and, bass, bar, are, components, of, the, internal, construction, all, the, parts, of, a, double, bass, are, glued, together, except, the, soundpost, bridge, and, tailpiece, which, are, held, in, place, by, string, tension, although, the, soundpost, usually, remains, in, place, when, the, instrument, s, strings, are, loosened, or, removed, as, long, as, the, bass, is, kept, on, its, back, some, luthiers, recommend, changing, only, one, string, at, a, time, to, reduce, the, risk, of, the, soundpost, falling, if, the, soundpost, falls, a, luthier, is, needed, to, put, the, soundpost, back, into, position, as, this, must, be, done, with, tools, inserted, into, the, f, holes, moreover, the, exact, placement, of, the, soundpost, under, the, bridge, is, essential, for, the, instrument, to, sound, its, best, basic, bridges, are, carved, from, a, single, piece, of, wood, which, is, customized, to, match, the, shape, of, the, top, of, each, instrument, the, least, expensive, bridges, on, student, instruments, may, be, customized, just, by, sanding, the, feet, to, match, the, shape, of, the, instrument, s, top, a, bridge, on, a, professional, bassist, s, instrument, may, be, ornately, carved, by, a, luthier, professional, bassists, are, more, likely, to, have, adjustable, bridges, which, have, a, metal, screw, mechanism, this, enables, the, bassist, to, raise, or, lower, the, height, of, the, strings, to, accommodate, changing, humidity, or, temperature, conditions, the, metal, tuning, machines, are, attached, to, the, sides, of, the, pegbox, with, metal, screws, while, tuning, mechanisms, generally, differ, from, the, higher, pitched, orchestral, stringed, instruments, some, basses, have, non, functional, ornamental, tuning, pegs, projecting, from, the, side, of, the, pegbox, in, imitation, of, the, tuning, pegs, on, a, cello, or, violin, several, manufacturers, make, travel, instruments, which, are, double, basses, that, have, features, which, reduce, the, size, of, the, instrument, so, that, the, instrument, will, meet, airline, travel, requirements, travel, basses, are, designed, for, touring, musicians, one, type, of, travel, bass, has, a, much, smaller, body, than, normal, while, still, retaining, all, of, the, features, needed, for, playing, while, these, smaller, body, instruments, appear, similar, to, electric, upright, basses, the, difference, is, that, small, body, travel, basses, still, have, a, fairly, large, hollow, acoustic, sound, chamber, while, many, eubs, are, solid, body, or, only, have, a, small, hollow, chamber, a, second, type, of, travel, bass, has, a, hinged, or, removable, neck, and, a, regular, sized, body, the, hinged, or, removable, neck, makes, the, instrument, smaller, when, it, is, packed, for, transportation, the, history, of, the, double, bass, is, tightly, coupled, to, the, development, of, string, technology, as, it, was, the, advent, of, overwound, gut, strings, which, first, rendered, the, instrument, more, generally, practicable, as, wound, or, overwound, strings, attain, low, notes, within, a, smaller, overall, string, diameter, than, non, wound, strings, professor, larry, hurst, argues, that, had, it, not, been, for, the, appearance, of, the, overwound, gut, string, in, the, 1650s, the, double, bass, would, surely, have, become, extinct, because, thicknesses, needed, for, regular, gut, strings, made, the, lower, pitched, strings, almost, unplayable, and, hindered, the, development, of, fluid, rapid, playing, in, the, lower, register, prior, to, the, 20th, century, double, bass, strings, were, usually, made, of, catgut, however, steel, has, largely, replaced, it, because, steel, strings, hold, their, pitch, better, and, yield, more, volume, when, played, with, the, bow, gut, strings, are, also, more, vulnerable, to, changes, of, humidity, and, temperature, and, break, more, easily, than, steel, strings, gut, strings, are, nowadays, mostly, used, by, bassists, who, perform, in, baroque, ensembles, rockabilly, bands, traditional, blues, bands, and, bluegrass, bands, in, some, cases, the, low, e, and, a, are, wound, in, silver, to, give, them, added, mass, gut, strings, provide, the, dark, thumpy, sound, heard, on, 1940s, and, 1950s, recordings, the, late, jeff, sarli, a, blues, upright, bassist, said, that, starting, in, the, 1950s, they, began, to, reset, the, necks, on, basses, for, steel, strings, rockabilly, and, bluegrass, bassists, also, prefer, gut, because, it, is, much, easier, to, perform, the, slapping, upright, bass, style, in, which, the, strings, are, percussively, slapped, and, clicked, against, the, fingerboard, with, gut, strings, than, with, steel, strings, because, gut, does, not, hurt, the, plucking, fingers, as, much, a, less, expensive, alternative, to, gut, strings, is, nylon, strings, the, higher, strings, are, pure, nylon, and, the, lower, strings, are, nylon, wrapped, in, wire, to, add, more, mass, to, the, string, slowing, the, vibration, and, thus, facilitating, lower, pitches, the, change, from, gut, to, steel, has, also, affected, the, instrument, s, playing, technique, over, the, last, hundred, years, steel, strings, can, be, set, up, closer, to, the, fingerboard, and, additionally, strings, can, be, played, in, higher, positions, on, the, lower, strings, and, still, produce, clear, tone, the, classic, 19th, century, franz, simandl, method, does, not, use, the, low, e, string, in, higher, positions, because, older, gut, strings, set, up, high, over, the, fingerboard, could, not, produce, clear, tone, in, these, higher, positions, however, with, modern, steel, strings, bassists, can, play, with, clear, tone, in, higher, positions, on, the, low, e, and, a, strings, particularly, when, they, use, modern, lighter, gauge, lower, tension, steel, strings, the, double, bass, bow, comes, in, two, distinct, forms, shown, below, the, french, or, overhand, bow, is, similar, in, shape, and, implementation, to, the, bow, used, on, the, other, members, of, the, orchestral, string, instrument, family, while, the, german, or, butler, bow, is, typically, broader, and, shorter, and, is, held, in, a, hand, shake, or, hacksaw, position, these, two, bows, provide, different, ways, of, moving, the, arm, and, distributing, force, and, weight, on, the, strings, proponents, of, the, french, bow, argue, that, it, is, more, maneuverable, due, to, the, angle, at, which, the, player, holds, the, bow, advocates, of, the, german, bow, claim, that, it, allows, the, player, to, apply, more, arm, weight, on, the, strings, the, differences, between, the, two, however, are, minute, for, a, proficient, player, and, modern, players, in, major, orchestras, use, both, bows, the, german, bow, sometimes, called, the, butler, bow, is, the, older, of, the, two, designs, the, design, of, the, bow, and, the, manner, of, holding, it, descend, from, the, older, viol, instrument, family, with, older, viols, before, frogs, had, screw, threads, to, tighten, the, bow, players, held, the, bow, with, two, fingers, between, the, stick, and, the, hair, to, maintain, tension, of, the, hair, proponents, of, the, use, of, german, bow, claim, that, the, german, bow, is, easier, to, use, for, heavy, strokes, that, require, a, lot, of, power, compared, to, the, french, bow, the, german, bow, has, a, taller, frog, and, the, player, holds, it, with, the, palm, angled, upwards, as, with, the, upright, members, of, the, viol, family, when, held, in, the, traditionally, correct, manner, the, thumb, applies, the, necessary, power, to, generate, the, desired, sound, the, index, finger, meets, the, bow, at, the, point, where, the, frog, meets, the, stick, the, index, finger, also, applies, an, upward, torque, to, the, frog, when, tilting, the, bow, the, little, finger, or, pinky, supports, the, frog, from, underneath, while, the, ring, finger, and, middle, finger, rest, in, the, space, between, the, hair, and, the, shaft, the, french, bow, was, not, widely, popular, until, its, adoption, by, 19th, century, virtuoso, giovanni, bottesini, this, style, is, more, similar, to, the, traditional, bows, of, the, smaller, string, family, instruments, it, is, held, as, if, the, hand, is, resting, by, the, side, of, the, performer, with, the, palm, facing, toward, the, bass, the, thumb, rests, on, the, shaft, of, the, bow, next, to, the, frog, while, the, other, fingers, drape, on, the, other, side, of, the, bow, various, styles, dictate, the, curve, of, the, fingers, and, thumb, as, do, the, style, of, piece, a, more, pronounced, curve, and, lighter, hold, on, the, bow, is, used, for, virtuoso, or, more, delicate, pieces, while, a, flatter, curve, and, sturdier, grip, on, the, bow, sacrifices, some, power, for, easier, control, in, strokes, such, as, detach, spiccato, and, staccato, double, bass, bows, vary, in, length, ranging, from, 60, to, 75, cm, 24, 30, in, in, general, a, bass, bow, is, shorter, and, heavier, than, a, cello, bow, pernambuco, also, known, as, brazilwood, is, regarded, as, an, excellent, quality, stick, material, but, due, to, its, scarcity, and, expense, other, materials, are, increasingly, being, used, inexpensive, student, bows, may, be, constructed, of, solid, fiberglass, which, makes, the, bow, much, lighter, than, a, wooden, bow, even, too, light, to, produce, a, good, tone, in, some, cases, student, bows, may, also, be, made, of, the, less, valuable, varieties, of, brazilwood, snakewood, and, carbon, fiber, are, also, used, in, bows, of, a, variety, of, different, qualities, the, frog, of, the, double, bass, bow, is, usually, made, out, of, ebony, although, snakewood, and, buffalo, horn, are, used, by, some, luthiers, the, frog, is, movable, as, it, can, be, tightened, or, loosened, with, a, knob, like, all, violin, family, bows, the, bow, is, loosened, at, the, end, of, a, practice, session, or, performance, the, bow, is, tightened, before, playing, until, it, reaches, a, tautness, that, is, preferred, by, the, player, the, frog, on, a, quality, bow, is, decorated, with, mother, of, pearl, inlay, bows, have, a, leather, wrapping, on, the, wooden, part, of, the, bow, near, the, frog, along, with, the, leather, wrapping, there, is, also, a, wire, wrapping, made, of, silver, in, quality, bows, the, hair, is, usually, horsehair, part, of, the, regular, maintenance, of, a, bow, is, having, the, bow, rehaired, by, a, luthier, with, fresh, horsehair, and, having, the, leather, and, wire, wrapping, replaced, the, double, bass, bow, is, strung, with, either, white, or, black, horsehair, or, a, combination, of, the, two, known, as, salt, and, pepper, as, opposed, to, the, customary, white, horsehair, used, on, the, bows, of, other, string, instruments, some, of, the, lowest, quality, lowest, cost, student, bows, are, made, with, synthetic, hair, synthetic, hair, does, not, have, the, tiny, barbs, that, real, horsehair, has, so, it, does, not, grip, the, string, well, or, take, rosin, well, string, players, apply, rosin, to, the, bow, hair, so, it, grips, the, string, and, makes, it, vibrate, double, bass, rosin, is, generally, softer, and, stickier, than, violin, rosin, to, allow, the, hair, to, grab, the, thicker, strings, better, but, players, use, a, wide, variety, of, rosins, that, vary, from, quite, hard, like, violin, rosin, to, quite, soft, depending, on, the, weather, the, humidity, and, the, preference, of, the, player, the, amount, used, generally, depends, on, the, type, of, music, being, performed, as, well, as, the, personal, preferences, of, the, player, some, brands, of, rosin, such, as, wiedoeft, or, pop, s, double, bass, rosin, are, softer, and, more, prone, to, melting, in, hot, weather, owing, to, their, relatively, small, diameters, the, strings, themselves, do, not, move, much, air, and, therefore, cannot, produce, much, sound, on, their, own, the, vibrational, energy, of, the, strings, must, somehow, be, transferred, to, the, surrounding, air, to, do, this, the, strings, vibrate, the, bridge, and, this, in, turn, vibrates, the, top, surface, very, small, amplitude, but, relatively, large, force, variations, due, to, the, cyclically, varying, tension, in, the, vibrating, string, at, the, bridge, are, transformed, to, larger, amplitude, ones, by, combination, of, bridge, and, body, of, the, bass, the, bridge, transforms, the, high, force, small, amplitude, vibrations, to, lower, force, higher, amplitude, vibrations, on, the, top, of, the, bass, body, the, top, is, connected, to, the, back, by, means, of, a, sound, post, so, the, back, also, vibrates, both, the, front, and, back, transmit, the, vibrations, to, the, air, and, act, to, match, the, impedance, of, the, vibrating, string, to, the, acoustic, impedance, of, the, air, because, the, acoustic, bass, is, a, non, fretted, instrument, any, string, vibration, due, to, plucking, or, bowing, will, cause, an, audible, sound, due, to, the, strings, vibrating, against, the, fingerboard, near, to, the, fingered, position, this, buzzing, sound, gives, the, note, its, character, the, lowest, note, of, a, double, bass, is, an, e, 1, on, standard, four, string, basses, at, approximately, 41, hz, or, a, c, 1, 33, hz, or, sometimes, b, 0, 31, hz, when, five, strings, are, used, this, is, within, about, an, octave, above, the, lowest, frequency, that, the, average, human, ear, can, perceive, as, a, distinctive, pitch, the, top, of, the, instrument, s, fingerboard, range, is, typically, near, d, 5, two, octaves, and, a, fifth, above, the, open, pitch, of, the, g, string, g, 2, as, shown, in, the, range, illustration, found, at, the, head, of, this, article, playing, beyond, the, end, of, the, fingerboard, can, be, accomplished, by, pulling, the, string, slightly, to, the, side, double, bass, symphony, parts, sometimes, indicate, that, the, performer, should, play, harmonics, also, called, flageolet, tones, in, which, the, bassist, lightly, touches, the, string, without, pressing, it, onto, the, fingerboard, in, the, usual, fashion, in, the, location, of, a, note, and, then, plucks, or, bows, the, note, bowed, harmonics, are, used, in, contemporary, music, for, their, glassy, sound, both, natural, harmonics, and, artificial, harmonics, where, the, thumb, stops, the, note, and, the, octave, or, other, harmonic, is, activated, by, lightly, touching, the, string, at, the, relative, node, point, extend, the, instrument, s, range, considerably, natural, and, artificial, harmonics, are, used, in, plenty, of, virtuoso, concertos, for, the, double, bass, orchestral, parts, from, the, standard, classical, repertoire, rarely, demand, the, double, bass, exceed, a, two, octave, and, a, minor, third, range, from, e, 1, to, g, 3, with, occasional, a, 3, s, appearing, in, the, standard, repertoire, an, exception, to, this, rule, is, orff, s, carmina, burana, which, calls, for, three, octaves, and, a, perfect, fourth, the, upper, limit, of, this, range, is, extended, a, great, deal, for, 20th, and, 21st, century, orchestral, parts, e, g, prokofiev, s, lieutenant, kij, suite, c, 1933, bass, solo, which, calls, for, notes, as, high, as, d, 4, and, e, 4, the, upper, range, a, virtuoso, solo, player, can, achieve, using, natural, and, artificial, harmonics, is, hard, to, define, as, it, depends, on, the, skill, of, the, particular, player, the, high, harmonic, in, the, range, illustration, found, at, the, head, of, this, article, may, be, taken, as, representative, rather, than, normative, five, string, instruments, have, an, additional, string, typically, tuned, to, a, low, b, below, the, e, string, b, 0, on, rare, occasions, a, higher, string, is, added, instead, tuned, to, the, c, above, the, g, string, c, 3, four, string, instruments, may, feature, the, c, extension, extending, the, range, of, the, e, string, downwards, to, c, 1, sometimes, b, 0, traditionally, the, double, bass, is, a, transposing, instrument, since, much, of, the, double, bass, s, range, lies, below, the, standard, bass, clef, it, is, notated, an, octave, higher, than, it, sounds, to, avoid, having, to, use, excessive, ledger, lines, below, the, staff, thus, when, double, bass, players, and, cellists, are, playing, from, a, combined, bass, cello, part, as, used, in, many, mozart, and, haydn, symphonies, they, will, play, in, octaves, with, the, basses, one, octave, below, the, cellos, this, transposition, applies, even, when, bass, players, are, reading, the, tenor, and, treble, clef, which, are, used, in, solo, playing, and, some, orchestral, parts, the, tenor, clef, is, also, used, by, composers, for, cello, and, low, brass, parts, the, use, of, tenor, or, treble, clef, avoids, excessive, ledger, lines, above, the, staff, when, notating, the, instrument, s, upper, range, other, notation, traditions, exist, italian, solo, music, is, typically, written, at, the, sounding, pitch, and, the, old, german, method, sounded, an, octave, below, where, notation, except, in, the, treble, clef, where, the, music, was, written, at, pitch, the, double, bass, is, generally, tuned, in, fourths, in, contrast, to, other, members, of, the, orchestral, string, family, which, are, tuned, in, fifths, for, example, the, violin, s, four, strings, are, from, lowest, pitched, to, highest, pitched, g, d, a, e, the, standard, tuning, lowest, pitched, to, highest, pitched, for, bass, is, e, a, d, g, starting, from, e, below, second, low, c, concert, pitch, this, is, the, same, as, the, standard, tuning, of, a, bass, guitar, and, is, one, octave, lower, than, the, four, lowest, pitched, strings, of, standard, guitar, tuning, prior, to, the, 19th, century, many, double, basses, had, only, three, strings, giovanni, bottesini, 1821, 1889, favored, the, three, stringed, instrument, popular, in, italy, at, the, time, because, the, three, stringed, instrument, being, more, sonorous, many, cobla, bands, in, catalonia, still, have, players, using, traditional, three, string, double, basses, tuned, a, d, g, throughout, classical, repertoire, there, are, notes, that, fall, below, the, range, of, a, standard, double, bass, notes, below, low, e, appear, regularly, in, the, double, bass, parts, found, in, later, arrangements, and, interpretations, of, baroque, music, in, the, classical, era, the, double, bass, typically, doubled, the, cello, part, an, octave, below, occasionally, requiring, descent, to, c, below, the, e, of, the, four, string, double, bass, in, the, romantic, era, and, the, 20th, century, composers, such, as, wagner, mahler, busoni, and, prokofiev, also, requested, notes, below, the, low, e, there, are, several, methods, for, making, these, notes, available, to, the, player, players, with, standard, double, basses, e, a, d, g, may, play, the, notes, below, e, an, octave, higher, or, if, this, sounds, awkward, the, entire, passage, may, be, transposed, up, an, octave, the, player, may, tune, the, low, e, string, down, to, the, lowest, note, required, in, the, piece, d, or, c, four, string, basses, may, be, fitted, with, a, low, c, extension, see, below, or, the, player, may, employ, a, five, string, instrument, with, the, additional, lower, string, tuned, to, c, or, more, commonly, in, modern, times, b, three, octaves, and, a, semitone, below, middle, c, several, major, european, orchestras, use, basses, with, a, fifth, string, most, professional, orchestral, players, use, four, string, double, basses, with, a, c, extension, this, is, an, extra, section, of, fingerboard, mounted, on, the, head, of, the, bass, it, extends, the, fingerboard, under, the, lowest, string, and, gives, an, additional, four, semitones, of, downward, range, the, lowest, string, is, typically, tuned, down, to, c, 1, an, octave, below, the, lowest, note, on, the, cello, as, it, is, quite, common, for, a, bass, part, to, double, the, cello, part, an, octave, lower, more, rarely, this, string, may, be, tuned, to, a, low, b, 0, as, a, few, works, in, the, orchestral, repertoire, call, for, such, a, b, such, as, respighi, s, the, pines, of, rome, in, rare, cases, some, players, have, a, low, b, extension, which, has, b, as, its, lowest, note, there, are, several, varieties, of, extensions, in, the, simplest, mechanical, extensions, there, are, no, mechanical, aids, attached, to, the, fingerboard, extension, except, a, locking, nut, or, gate, for, the, e, note, to, play, the, extension, notes, the, player, reaches, back, over, the, area, under, the, scroll, to, press, the, string, to, the, fingerboard, the, advantage, of, this, fingered, extension, is, that, the, player, can, adjust, the, intonation, of, all, of, the, stopped, notes, on, the, extension, and, there, are, no, mechanical, noises, from, metal, keys, and, levers, the, disadvantage, of, the, fingered, extension, is, that, it, can, be, hard, to, perform, rapid, alternations, between, low, notes, on, the, extension, and, notes, on, the, regular, fingerboard, such, as, a, bassline, that, quickly, alternates, between, g, 1, and, d, 1, the, simplest, type, of, mechanical, aid, is, the, use, of, wooden, fingers, or, gates, that, can, be, closed, to, press, the, string, down, and, fret, the, c, d, e, or, e, notes, this, system, is, particularly, useful, for, basslines, that, have, a, repeating, pedal, point, such, as, a, low, d, because, once, the, note, is, locked, in, place, with, the, mechanical, finger, the, lowest, string, sounds, a, different, note, when, played, open, the, most, complicated, mechanical, aid, for, use, with, extensions, is, the, mechanical, lever, system, nicknamed, the, machine, this, lever, system, which, superficially, resembles, the, keying, mechanism, of, reed, instruments, such, as, the, bassoon, mounts, levers, beside, the, regular, fingerboard, near, the, nut, on, the, e, string, side, which, remotely, activate, metal, fingers, on, the, extension, fingerboard, the, most, expensive, metal, lever, systems, also, give, the, player, the, ability, to, lock, down, notes, on, the, extension, fingerboard, as, with, the, wooden, finger, system, one, criticism, of, these, devices, is, that, they, may, lead, to, unwanted, metallic, clicking, noises, once, a, mechanical, finger, of, the, wooden, finger, extension, or, the, metal, finger, machine, extension, is, locked, down, or, depressed, it, is, not, easy, to, make, microtonal, pitch, adjustments, or, glissando, effects, as, is, possible, with, a, hand, fingered, extension, five, string, basses, in, which, the, lowest, string, is, normally, b, 0, may, use, either, a, two, semitone, extension, providing, a, low, a, or, the, very, rare, low, g, extension, a, small, number, of, bass, players, tune, their, strings, in, fifths, like, a, cello, but, an, octave, lower, c, 1, g, 1, d, 2, a, 2, low, to, high, this, tuning, was, used, by, the, jazz, player, red, mitchell, and, is, used, by, some, classical, players, notably, the, canadian, bassist, joel, quarrington, advocates, of, tuning, the, bass, in, fifths, point, out, that, all, of, the, other, orchestral, strings, are, tuned, in, fifths, violin, viola, and, cello, so, this, puts, the, bass, in, the, same, tuning, approach, fifth, tuning, provides, a, bassist, with, a, wider, range, of, pitch, than, a, standard, e, a, d, g, bass, as, it, ranges, without, an, extension, from, c, 1, to, a, 2, some, players, who, use, fifths, tuning, who, play, a, five, string, bass, use, an, additional, high, e, 3, string, thus, from, lowest, to, highest, c, g, d, a, e, some, fifth, tuning, bassists, who, only, have, a, four, string, instrument, and, who, are, mainly, performing, soloistic, works, use, the, g, d, a, e, tuning, thus, omitting, the, low, c, string, but, gaining, a, high, e, some, fifth, tuning, bassists, who, use, a, five, string, use, a, smaller, scale, instrument, thus, making, fingering, somewhat, easier, the, berlioz, strauss, treatise, on, instrumentation, first, published, in, 1844, states, that, a, good, orchestra, should, have, several, four, string, double, basses, some, of, them, tuned, in, fifths, and, thirds, the, book, then, shows, a, tuning, of, e, 1, g, 1, d, 2, a, 2, from, bottom, to, top, string, together, with, the, other, double, basses, tuned, in, fourths, a, combination, of, open, strings, would, be, available, which, would, greatly, increase, the, sonority, of, the, orchestra, in, classical, solo, playing, the, double, bass, is, usually, tuned, a, whole, tone, higher, f, 1, b, 1, e, 2, a, 2, this, higher, tuning, is, called, solo, tuning, whereas, the, regular, tuning, is, known, as, orchestral, tuning, solo, tuning, strings, are, generally, thinner, than, regular, strings, string, tension, differs, so, much, between, solo, and, orchestral, tuning, that, a, different, set, of, strings, is, often, employed, that, has, a, lighter, gauge, strings, are, always, labelled, for, either, solo, or, orchestral, tuning, and, published, solo, music, is, arranged, for, either, solo, or, orchestral, tuning, some, popular, solos, and, concerti, such, as, the, koussevitsky, concerto, are, available, in, both, solo, and, orchestral, tuning, arrangements, solo, tuning, strings, can, be, tuned, down, a, tone, to, play, in, orchestra, pitch, but, the, strings, often, lack, projection, in, orchestral, tuning, and, their, pitch, may, be, unstable, some, contemporary, composers, specify, highly, specialized, scordatura, intentionally, changing, the, tuning, of, the, open, strings, changing, the, pitch, of, the, open, strings, makes, different, notes, available, as, pedal, points, and, harmonics, a, variant, and, much, less, commonly, used, form, of, solo, tuning, used, in, some, eastern, european, countries, is, a, 1, d, 2, g, 2, c, 3, which, omits, the, low, e, string, from, orchestral, tuning, and, then, adds, a, high, c, string, the, tololoche, in, mexico, a, smaller, variant, of, the, double, bass, also, uses, the, a, d, g, c, tuning, some, bassists, with, five, string, basses, use, a, high, c, 3, string, as, the, fifth, string, instead, of, a, low, b, 0, string, adding, the, high, c, string, facilitates, the, performance, of, solo, repertoire, with, a, high, tessitura, range, another, option, is, to, utilize, both, a, low, c, or, low, b, extension, and, a, high, c, string, when, choosing, a, bass, with, a, fifth, string, the, player, may, decide, between, adding, a, higher, pitched, string, a, high, c, string, or, a, lower, pitched, string, typically, a, low, b, to, accommodate, the, additional, fifth, string, the, fingerboard, is, usually, slightly, widened, and, the, top, slightly, thicker, to, handle, the, increased, tension, most, five, string, basses, are, therefore, larger, in, size, than, a, standard, four, string, bass, some, five, stringed, instruments, are, converted, four, string, instruments, because, these, do, not, have, wider, fingerboards, some, players, find, them, more, difficult, to, finger, and, bow, converted, four, string, basses, usually, require, either, a, new, thicker, top, or, lighter, strings, to, compensate, for, the, increased, tension, the, six, string, double, bass, has, both, a, high, c, and, a, low, b, making, it, very, useful, and, it, is, becoming, more, practical, after, several, updates, it, is, ideal, for, solo, and, orchestral, playing, because, it, has, a, more, playable, range, this, can, be, achieved, on, a, six, string, violone, in, d, by, restringing, it, with, double, bass, strings, making, the, tuning, b, 0, e, 1, a, 1, d, 2, g, 2, c, 3, double, bassists, either, stand, or, sit, to, play, the, instrument, the, instrument, height, is, set, by, adjusting, the, endpin, such, that, the, player, can, reach, the, desired, playing, zones, of, the, strings, with, bow, or, plucking, hand, bassists, who, stand, and, bow, sometimes, set, the, endpin, by, aligning, the, first, finger, in, either, first, or, half, position, with, eye, level, although, there, is, little, standardization, in, this, regard, players, who, sit, generally, use, a, stool, about, the, height, of, the, player, s, trousers, inseam, length, traditionally, double, bassists, stood, to, play, solo, and, sat, to, play, in, the, orchestra, or, opera, pit, now, it, is, unusual, for, a, player, to, be, equally, proficient, in, both, positions, so, some, soloists, sit, as, with, joel, quarrington, jeff, bradetich, thierry, barb, and, others, and, some, orchestral, bassists, stand, when, playing, in, the, instrument, s, upper, range, above, g, 3, the, g, below, middle, c, the, player, shifts, the, hand, from, behind, the, neck, and, flattens, it, out, using, the, side, of, the, thumb, to, press, down, the, string, this, technique, also, used, on, the, cello, is, called, thumb, position, while, playing, in, thumb, position, few, players, use, the, fourth, little, finger, as, it, is, usually, too, weak, to, produce, reliable, tone, this, is, also, true, for, cellists, although, some, extreme, chords, or, extended, techniques, especially, in, contemporary, music, may, require, its, use, rockabilly, style, can, be, very, demanding, on, the, plucking, hand, due, to, rockabilly, s, use, of, slapping, on, the, fingerboard, performing, on, bass, can, be, physically, demanding, because, the, strings, are, under, relatively, high, tension, also, the, space, between, notes, on, the, fingerboard, is, large, due, to, scale, length, and, string, spacing, so, players, must, hold, their, fingers, apart, for, the, notes, in, the, lower, positions, and, shift, positions, frequently, to, play, basslines, as, with, all, non, fretted, string, instruments, performers, must, learn, to, place, their, fingers, precisely, to, produce, the, correct, pitch, for, bassists, with, shorter, arms, or, smaller, hands, the, large, spaces, between, pitches, may, present, a, significant, challenge, especially, in, the, lowest, range, where, the, spaces, between, notes, are, largest, however, the, increased, use, of, playing, techniques, such, as, thumb, position, and, modifications, to, the, bass, such, as, the, use, of, lighter, gauge, strings, at, lower, tension, have, eased, the, difficulty, of, playing, the, instrument, bass, parts, have, relatively, fewer, fast, passages, double, stops, or, large, jumps, in, range, these, parts, are, usually, given, to, the, cello, section, since, the, cello, is, a, smaller, instrument, on, which, these, techniques, are, more, easily, performed, despite, the, size, of, the, instrument, it, is, not, as, loud, as, many, other, instruments, due, to, its, low, musical, pitch, in, a, large, orchestra, usually, between, four, and, eight, bassists, play, the, same, bassline, in, unison, to, produce, enough, volume, in, the, largest, orchestras, bass, sections, may, have, as, many, as, ten, or, twelve, players, but, modern, budget, constraints, make, bass, sections, this, large, unusual, when, writing, solo, passages, for, the, bass, in, orchestral, or, chamber, music, composers, typically, ensure, the, orchestration, is, light, so, it, does, not, obscure, the, bass, while, amplification, is, rarely, used, in, classical, music, in, some, cases, where, a, bass, soloist, performs, a, concerto, with, a, full, orchestra, subtle, amplification, called, acoustic, enhancement, may, be, used, the, use, of, microphones, and, amplifiers, in, a, classical, setting, has, led, to, debate, within, the, classical, community, as, purists, maintain, that, the, natural, acoustic, sound, of, voices, instruments, in, a, given, hall, should, not, be, altered, in, many, genres, such, as, jazz, and, blues, players, use, amplification, via, a, specialized, amplifier, and, loudspeakers, a, piezoelectric, pickup, connects, to, the, amplifier, with, a, 1, 4, inch, cable, bluegrass, and, jazz, players, typically, use, less, amplification, than, blues, psychobilly, or, jam, band, players, in, the, latter, cases, high, overall, volume, from, other, amplifiers, and, instruments, may, cause, unwanted, acoustic, feedback, a, problem, exacerbated, by, the, bass, s, large, surface, area, and, interior, volume, the, feedback, problem, has, led, to, technological, fixes, like, electronic, feedback, eliminator, devices, essentially, an, automated, notch, filter, that, identifies, and, reduces, frequencies, where, feedback, occurs, and, instruments, like, the, electric, upright, bass, which, has, playing, characteristics, like, the, double, bass, but, usually, little, or, no, soundbox, which, makes, feedback, less, likely, some, bassists, reduce, the, problem, of, feedback, by, lowering, their, onstage, volume, or, playing, further, away, from, their, bass, amp, speakers, in, rockabilly, and, psychobilly, percussively, slapping, the, strings, against, the, fingerboard, is, an, important, part, of, the, bass, playing, style, since, piezoelectric, pickups, are, not, good, at, reproducing, the, sounds, of, strings, being, slapped, against, the, fingerboard, bassists, in, these, genres, often, use, both, piezoelectric, pickups, for, the, low, bass, tone, and, a, miniature, condenser, mic, to, pick, up, the, percussive, slapping, sounds, these, two, signals, are, blended, together, using, a, simple, mixer, before, the, signal, is, sent, to, the, bass, amp, the, double, bass, s, large, size, and, relative, fragility, make, it, cumbersome, to, handle, and, transport, most, bassists, use, soft, cases, referred, to, as, gig, bags, to, protect, the, instrument, during, transport, these, range, from, inexpensive, thin, unpadded, cases, used, by, students, which, only, protect, against, scratches, and, rain, to, thickly, padded, versions, for, professional, players, which, also, protect, against, bumps, and, impacts, some, bassists, carry, their, bow, in, a, hard, bow, case, more, expensive, bass, cases, have, a, large, pocket, for, a, bow, case, players, also, may, use, a, small, cart, and, end, pin, attached, wheels, to, move, the, bass, some, higher, priced, padded, cases, have, wheels, attached, to, the, case, another, option, found, in, higher, priced, padded, cases, are, backpack, straps, to, make, it, easier, to, carry, the, instrument, hard, flight, cases, have, cushioned, interiors, and, tough, exteriors, of, carbon, fiber, graphite, fiberglass, or, kevlar, the, cost, of, good, hard, cases, several, thousand, us, dollars, and, the, high, airline, fees, for, shipping, them, tend, to, limit, their, use, to, touring, professionals, double, bass, players, use, various, accessories, to, help, them, to, perform, and, rehearse, three, types, of, mutes, are, used, in, orchestral, music, a, wooden, mute, that, slides, onto, the, bridge, a, rubber, mute, that, attaches, to, the, bridge, and, a, wire, device, with, brass, weights, that, fits, onto, the, bridge, the, player, uses, the, mute, when, the, italian, instruction, con, sordino, with, mute, appears, in, the, bass, part, and, removes, it, in, response, to, the, instruction, senza, sordino, without, mute, with, the, mute, on, the, tone, of, the, bass, is, quieter, darker, and, more, somber, bowed, bass, parts, with, a, mute, can, have, a, nasal, tone, players, use, a, third, type, of, mute, a, heavy, rubber, practice, mute, to, practice, quietly, without, disturbing, others, e, g, in, a, hotel, room, a, quiver, is, an, accessory, for, holding, the, bow, it, is, often, made, of, leather, and, it, attaches, to, the, bridge, and, tailpiece, with, ties, or, straps, it, is, used, to, hold, the, bow, while, a, player, plays, pizzicato, parts, a, wolf, tone, eliminator, is, used, to, lessen, unwanted, sympathetic, vibrations, in, the, part, of, a, string, between, the, bridge, and, the, tailpiece, which, can, cause, tone, problems, for, certain, notes, it, is, a, rubber, tube, cut, down, the, side, that, is, used, with, a, cylindrical, metal, sleeve, which, also, has, a, slot, on, the, side, the, metal, cylinder, has, a, screw, and, a, nut, that, fastens, the, device, to, the, string, different, placements, of, the, cylinder, along, the, string, influence, or, eliminate, the, frequency, at, which, the, wolf, tone, occurs, it, is, essentially, an, attenuator, that, slightly, shifts, the, natural, frequency, of, the, string, and, or, instrument, body, cutting, down, on, the, reverberation, the, wolf, tone, occurs, because, the, strings, below, the, bridge, sometimes, resonate, at, pitches, close, to, notes, on, the, playing, part, of, the, string, when, the, intended, note, makes, the, below, the, bridge, string, vibrate, sympathetically, a, dissonant, wolf, note, or, wolf, tone, can, occur, in, some, cases, the, wolf, tone, is, strong, enough, to, cause, an, audible, beating, sound, the, wolf, tone, often, occurs, with, the, note, g, on, the, bass, in, orchestra, instruments, tune, to, an, a, played, by, the, oboist, due, to, the, three, octave, gap, between, the, oboist, s, tuning, a, and, the, open, a, string, on, the, bass, for, example, in, an, orchestra, that, tunes, to, 440, hz, the, oboist, plays, an, a, 4, at, 440, hz, and, the, open, a, 1, of, the, bass, is, 55, hz, it, can, be, difficult, to, tune, the, bass, by, ear, during, the, short, period, that, the, oboist, plays, the, tuning, note, violinists, on, the, other, hand, tune, their, a, string, to, the, same, frequency, as, the, oboist, s, tuning, note, there, is, a, method, commonly, used, to, tune, a, double, bass, in, this, context, by, playing, the, a, harmonic, on, the, d, string, which, is, only, an, octave, below, the, oboe, a, and, then, matching, the, harmonics, of, the, other, strings, however, this, method, is, not, foolproof, since, some, basses, harmonics, are, not, perfectly, in, tune, with, the, open, strings, to, ensure, the, bass, is, in, tune, some, bassists, use, an, electronic, tuner, that, indicates, pitch, on, a, small, display, bassists, who, play, in, styles, that, use, a, bass, amp, such, as, blues, rockabilly, or, jazz, may, use, a, stompbox, format, electronic, tuner, which, mutes, the, bass, pickup, during, tuning, a, double, bass, stand, is, used, to, hold, the, instrument, in, place, and, raise, it, a, few, inches, off, the, ground, a, wide, variety, of, stands, are, available, and, there, is, no, one, common, design, the, double, bass, as, a, solo, instrument, enjoyed, a, period, of, popularity, during, the, 18th, century, and, many, of, the, most, popular, composers, from, that, era, wrote, pieces, for, the, double, bass, the, double, bass, then, often, referred, to, as, the, violone, used, different, tunings, from, region, to, region, the, viennese, tuning, a, 1, d, 2, f, 2, a, 2, was, popular, and, in, some, cases, a, fifth, string, or, even, sixth, string, was, added, f, 1, a, 1, d, 2, f, 2, a, 2, the, popularity, of, the, instrument, is, documented, in, leopold, mozart, s, second, edition, of, his, violinschule, where, he, writes, one, can, bring, forth, difficult, passages, easier, with, the, five, string, violone, and, i, heard, unusually, beautiful, performances, of, concertos, trios, solos, etc, the, earliest, known, concerto, for, double, bass, was, written, by, joseph, haydn, c, 1763, and, is, presumed, lost, in, a, fire, at, the, eisenstadt, library, the, earliest, known, existing, concertos, are, by, carl, ditters, von, dittersdorf, who, composed, two, concertos, for, the, double, bass, and, a, sinfonia, concertante, for, viola, and, double, bass, other, composers, that, have, written, concertos, from, this, period, include, johann, baptist, wanhal, franz, anton, hoffmeister, 3, concertos, leopold, kozeluch, anton, zimmermann, antonio, capuzzi, wenzel, pichl, 2, concertos, and, johannes, matthias, sperger, 18, concertos, while, many, of, these, names, were, leading, figures, to, the, music, public, of, their, time, they, are, generally, unknown, by, contemporary, audiences, wolfgang, amadeus, mozart, s, concert, aria, per, questa, bella, mano, k, 612, for, bass, double, bass, obbligato, and, orchestra, contains, impressive, writing, for, solo, double, bass, of, that, period, it, remains, popular, among, both, singers, and, double, bassists, today, the, double, bass, eventually, evolved, to, fit, the, needs, of, orchestras, that, required, lower, notes, and, a, louder, sound, the, leading, double, bassists, from, the, mid, to, late, 18th, century, such, as, josef, k, mpfer, friedrich, pischelberger, and, johannes, mathias, sperger, employed, the, viennese, tuning, bassist, johann, hindle, 1792, 1862, who, composed, a, concerto, for, the, double, bass, pioneered, tuning, the, bass, in, fourths, which, marked, a, turning, point, for, the, double, bass, and, its, role, in, solo, works, bassist, domenico, dragonetti, was, a, prominent, musical, figure, and, an, acquaintance, of, haydn, and, ludwig, van, beethoven, his, playing, was, known, all, the, way, from, his, homeland, italy, to, the, tsardom, of, russia, and, he, found, a, prominent, place, performing, in, concerts, with, the, philharmonic, society, of, london, beethoven, s, friendship, with, dragonetti, may, have, inspired, him, to, write, difficult, separate, parts, for, the, double, bass, in, his, symphonies, such, as, the, impressive, passages, in, the, third, movement, of, the, fifth, symphony, the, second, movement, of, the, seventh, symphony, and, last, movement, of, the, ninth, symphony, these, parts, do, not, double, the, cello, part, dragonetti, wrote, ten, concertos, for, the, double, bass, and, many, solo, works, for, bass, and, piano, during, rossini, s, stay, in, london, in, the, summer, of, 1824, he, composed, his, popular, duetto, for, cello, and, double, bass, for, dragonetti, and, the, cellist, david, salomons, dragonetti, frequently, played, on, a, three, string, double, bass, tuned, g, d, a, from, top, to, bottom, the, use, of, only, the, top, three, strings, was, popular, for, bass, soloists, and, principal, bassists, in, orchestras, in, the, 19th, century, because, it, reduced, the, pressure, on, the, wooden, top, of, the, bass, which, was, thought, to, create, a, more, resonant, sound, as, well, the, low, e, strings, used, during, the, 19th, century, were, thick, cords, made, of, gut, which, were, difficult, to, tune, and, play, in, the, 19th, century, the, opera, conductor, composer, and, bassist, giovanni, bottesini, was, considered, the, paganini, of, the, double, bass, of, his, time, a, reference, to, the, violin, virtuoso, and, composer, bottesini, s, bass, concertos, were, written, in, the, popular, italian, opera, style, of, the, 19th, century, which, exploit, the, double, bass, in, a, way, that, was, not, seen, beforehand, they, require, virtuosic, runs, and, great, leaps, to, the, highest, registers, of, the, instrument, even, into, the, realm, of, natural, and, artificial, harmonics, many, 19th, century, and, early, 20th, century, bassists, considered, these, compositions, unplayable, but, in, the, 2000s, they, are, frequently, performed, during, the, same, time, a, prominent, school, of, bass, players, in, the, czech, region, arose, which, included, franz, simandl, theodore, albin, findeisen, josef, hrabe, ludwig, manoly, and, adolf, mi, ek, simandl, and, hrabe, were, also, pedagogues, whose, method, books, and, studies, remain, in, use, in, the, 2000s, the, leading, figure, of, the, double, bass, in, the, early, 20th, century, was, serge, koussevitzky, best, known, as, conductor, of, the, boston, symphony, orchestra, who, popularized, the, double, bass, in, modern, times, as, a, solo, instrument, because, of, improvements, to, the, double, bass, with, steel, strings, and, better, set, ups, the, bass, is, now, played, at, a, more, advanced, level, than, ever, before, and, more, and, more, composers, have, written, works, for, the, double, bass, in, the, mid, century, and, in, the, following, decades, many, new, concerti, were, written, for, the, double, bass, including, nikos, skalkottas, s, concerto, 1942, eduard, tubin, s, concerto, 1948, lars, erik, larsson, s, concertino, 1957, gunther, schuller, s,

contrabassist, his, work, 26, 1, 1499, for, a, string, player, is, often, realized, by, a, solo, contrabass, player, although, it, can, also, be, played, by, a, violinist, violist, or, cellist, from, the, 1960s, through, the, end, of, the, century, gary, karr, was, the, leading, proponent, of, the, double, bass, as, a, solo, instrument, and, was, active, in, commissioning, or, having, hundreds, of, new, works, and, concerti, written, especially, for, him, karr, was, given, koussevitzky, s, famous, solo, double, bass, by, olga, koussevitsky, and, played, it, in, concerts, around, the, world,

such, as, time, for, three, and, project, trio, in, the, baroque, and, classical, periods, composers, typically, had, the, double, bass, double, the, cello, part, in, orchestral, passages, a, notable, exception, is, haydn, who, composed, solo, passages, for, the, double, bass, in, his, symphonies, no, 6, le, matin, no, 7, le, midi, no, 8, le, soir, no, 31, horn, signal, and, no, 45, farewell, but,

nineteenth, century, symphonies, and, concertos, the, typical, impact, of, separate, bass, and, cello, parts, was, that, bass, parts, became, simpler, and, cello, parts, got, the, melodic, lines, and, rapid, passage, work, a, double, bass, section, of, a, modern, orchestra, typically, uses, eight, double, bassists, usually, in, unison, smaller, orchestras, may, have, four, double, basses, and, in, exceptional, cases, bass, sections, may, have, as, many, as, ten, members, if, some, double, bassists, have, low, c, extensions, and, some, have, regular, low, e, basses, those, with, the, low, c, extensions, may, play, some, passages, an, octave, below, the, regular, double, basses, also, some, composers, write, divided, divisi, parts, for, the, basses, where, upper, and, lower, parts, in, the, music, are, often, assigned, to, outside, nearer, the, audience, and, inside, players, composers, writing, divisi, parts, for, bass, often, write, perfect, intervals, such, as, octaves, and, fifths, but, in, some, cases, use, thirds, and, sixths, where, a, composition, calls, for, a, solo, bass, part, the, principal, bass, invariably, plays, that, part, the, section, leader, or, principal, also, determines, the, bowings, often, based, on, bowings, set, out, by, the, concertmaster, in, some, cases, the, principal, bass, may, use, a, slightly, different, bowing, than, the, concertmaster, to, accommodate, the, requirements, of, playing, bass, the, principal, bass, also, leads, entrances, for, the, bass, section, typically, by, lifting, the, bow, or, plucking, hand,

bass, ensembles, at, its, conferences, and, sponsors, the, biennial, david, walter, composition, competition, which, includes, a, division, for, double, bass, ensemble, works, beginning, around, 1890, the, early, new, orleans, jazz, ensemble, which, played, a, mixture, of, marches, ragtime, and, dixieland, was, initially, a, marching, band, with, a, tuba, or, sousaphone, or, occasionally, bass, saxophone, supplying, the, bass, line, as, the, music, moved, into, bars, and, brothels, the, upright, bass, gradually, replaced, these, wind, instruments, around, the, 1920s, many, early, bassists, doubled, on, both, the, brass, bass, tuba, and, string, bass, as, the, instruments, were, then, often, referred, to, bassists, played, improvised, walking, bass, lines, scale, and, arpeggio, based, lines, that, outlined, the, chord, progression, because, an, unamplified, upright, bass, is, generally, the, quietest, instrument, in, a, jazz, band, many, players, of, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, used, the, slap, style, slapping, and, pulling, the, strings, to, produce, a, rhythmic, slap, sound, against, the, fingerboard, the, slap, style, cuts, through, the, sound, of, a, band, better, than, simply, plucking, the, strings, and, made, the, bass, more, easily, heard, on, early, sound, recordings, as, the, recording, equipment, of, that, time, did, not, favor, low, frequencies, for, more, about, the, slap, style, see, modern, playing, styles, below, jazz, bass, players, are, expected, to, improvise, an, accompaniment, line, or, solo, for, a, given, chord, progression, they, are, also, expected, to, know, the, rhythmic, patterns, that, are, appropriate, for, different, styles, e, g, afro, cuban, bassists, playing, in, a, big, band, must, also, be, able, to, read, written, out, bass, lines, as, some, arrangements, have, written, bass, parts, many, upright, bass, players, have, contributed, to, the, evolution, of, jazz, examples, include, swing, era, players, such, as, jimmy, blanton, who, played, with, duke, ellington, and, oscar, pettiford, who, pioneered, the, instrument, s, use, in, bebop, paul, chambers, who, worked, with, miles, davis, on, the, famous, kind, of, blue, album, achieved, renown, for, being, one, of, the, first, jazz, bassists, to, play, bebop, solos, with, the, bow, terry, plumeri, furthered, the, development, of, arco, bowed, solos, achieving, horn, like, technical, freedom, and, a, clear, vocal, bowed, tone, while, charlie, haden, best, known, for, his, work, with, ornette, coleman, defined, the, role, of, the, bass, in, free, jazz, a, number, of, other, bassists, such, as, ray, brown, slam, stewart, and, niels, henning, rsted, pedersen, were, central, to, the, history, of, jazz, stewart, who, was, popular, with, the, beboppers, played, his, solos, with, a, bow, combined, with, octave, humming, notably, charles, mingus, was, a, highly, regarded, composer, as, well, as, a, bassist, noted, for, his, technical, virtuosity, and, powerful, sound, scott, lafaro, influenced, a, generation, of, musicians, by, liberating, the, bass, from, contrapuntal, walking, behind, soloists, instead, favoring, interactive, conversational, melodies, since, the, commercial, availability, of, bass, amplifiers, in, the, 1950s, jazz, bassists, have, used, amplification, to, augment, the, natural, volume, of, the, instrument, while, the, electric, bass, guitar, was, used, intermittently, in, jazz, as, early, as, 1951, beginning, in, the, 1970s, bassist, bob, cranshaw, playing, with, saxophonist, sonny, rollins, and, fusion, pioneers, jaco, pastorius, and, stanley, clarke, began, to, commonly, substitute, the, bass, guitar, for, the, upright, bass, apart, from, the, jazz, styles, of, jazz, fusion, and, latin, influenced, jazz, however, the, upright, bass, is, still, the, dominant, bass, instrument, in, jazz, the, sound, and, tone, of, the, plucked, upright, bass, is, distinct, from, that, of, the, fretted, bass, guitar, the, upright, bass, produces, a, different, sound, than, the, bass, guitar, because, its, strings, are, not, stopped, by, metal, frets, instead, having, a, continuous, tonal, range, on, the, uninterrupted, fingerboard, as, well, bass, guitars, usually, have, a, solid, wood, body, which, means, that, their, sound, is, produced, by, electronic, amplification, of, the, vibration, of, the, strings, instead, of, the, upright, bass, s, acoustic, reverberation, demonstrative, examples, of, the, sound, of, a, solo, double, bass, and, its, technical, use, in, jazz, can, be, heard, on, the, solo, recordings, emerald, tears, 1978, by, dave, holland, or, emergence, 1986, by, miroslav, vitou, holland, also, recorded, an, album, with, the, representative, title, music, from, two, basses, 1971, on, which, he, plays, with, barre, phillips, while, he, sometimes, switches, to, cello, the, string, bass, is, the, most, commonly, used, bass, instrument, in, bluegrass, music, and, is, almost, always, plucked, though, some, modern, bluegrass, bassists, have, also, used, a, bow, the, bluegrass, bassist, is, part, of, the, rhythm, section, and, is, responsible, for, keeping, a, steady, beat, whether, fast, slow, in, 4, 4, 2, 4, or, 3, 4, time, the, bass, also, maintains, the, chord, progression, and, harmony, the, engelhardt, link, formerly, kay, brands, of, plywood, laminate, basses, have, long, been, popular, choices, for, bluegrass, bassists, most, bluegrass, bassists, use, the, 3, 4, size, bass, but, the, full, size, and, 5, 8, size, basses, are, also, used, early, pre, bluegrass, traditional, music, was, often, accompanied, by, the, cello, the, cellist, natalie, haas, points, out, that, in, the, us, you, can, find, old, photographs, and, even, old, recordings, of, american, string, bands, with, cello, however, the, cello, dropped, out, of, sight, in, folk, music, and, became, associated, with, the, orchestra, the, cello, did, not, reappear, in, bluegrass, until, the, 1990s, and, first, decade, of, the, 21st, century, some, contemporary, bluegrass, bands, favor, the, electric, bass, because, it, is, easier, to, transport, than, the, large, and, somewhat, fragile, upright, bass, however, the, bass, guitar, has, a, different, musical, sound, many, musicians, feel, the, slower, attack, and, percussive, woody, tone, of, the, upright, bass, gives, it, a, more, earthy, or, natural, sound, than, an, electric, bass, particularly, when, gut, strings, are, used, common, rhythms, in, bluegrass, bass, playing, involve, with, some, exceptions, plucking, on, beats, 1, and, 3, in, 4, 4, time, beats, 1, and, 2, in, 2, 4, time, and, on, the, downbeat, in, 3, 4, time, waltz, time, bluegrass, bass, lines, are, usually, simple, typically, staying, on, the, root, and, fifth, of, each, chord, throughout, most, of, a, song, there, are, two, main, exceptions, to, this, rule, bluegrass, bassists, often, do, a, diatonic, walkup, or, walkdown, in, which, they, play, every, beat, of, a, bar, for, one, or, two, bars, typically, when, there, is, a, chord, change, in, addition, if, a, bass, player, is, given, a, solo, they, may, play, a, walking, bass, line, with, a, note, on, every, beat, or, play, a, pentatonic, scale, influenced, bassline, an, early, bluegrass, bassist, to, rise, to, prominence, was, howard, watts, also, known, as, cedric, rainwater, who, played, with, bill, monroe, s, blue, grass, boys, beginning, in, 1944, the, classical, bassist, edgar, meyer, has, frequently, branched, out, into, newgrass, old, time, jazz, and, other, genres, my, all, time, favorite, is, todd, phillips, proclaimed, union, station, bassist, barry, bales, in, april, 2005, he, brought, a, completely, different, way, of, thinking, about, and, playing, bluegrass, an, upright, bass, was, the, standard, bass, instrument, in, traditional, country, western, music, while, the, upright, bass, is, still, occasionally, used, in, country, music, the, electric, bass, has, largely, replaced, its, bigger, cousin, in, country, music, especially, in, the, more, pop, infused, country, styles, of, the, 1990s, and, 2000s, such, as, new, country, slap, style, bass, is, sometimes, used, in, bluegrass, bass, playing, when, bluegrass, bass, players, slap, the, string, by, pulling, it, until, it, hits, the, fingerboard, or, hit, the, strings, against, the, fingerboard, it, adds, the, high, pitched, percussive, clack, or, slap, sound, to, the, low, pitched, bass, notes, sounding, much, like, the, clacks, of, a, tap, dancer, slapping, is, a, subject, of, minor, controversy, in, the, bluegrass, scene, even, slapping, experts, such, as, mike, bub, say, don, t, slap, on, every, gig, or, in, songs, where, it, is, not, appropriate, as, well, bluegrass, bassists, who, play, slap, style, on, live, shows, often, slap, less, on, records, bub, and, his, mentor, jerry, mccoury, rarely, do, slap, bass, on, recordings, while, bassists, such, as, jack, cook, slap, bass, on, the, occasional, faster, clinch, mountain, boys, song, bassists, such, as, gene, libbea, missy, raines, jenny, keel, and, barry, bales, slap, bass, bluegrass, bassist, mark, schatz, who, teaches, slap, bass, in, his, intermediate, bluegrass, bass, dvd, acknowledges, that, slap, bass, has, not, been, stylistically, very, predominant, in, the, music, i, have, recorded, he, notes, that, even, in, traditional, bluegrass, slap, bass, only, appears, sporadically, and, most, of, what, i, ve, done, has, been, on, the, more, contemporary, side, of, that, tony, rice, tim, o, brien, schatz, states, that, he, would, be, more, likely, to, use, it, in, a, live, situation, than, on, a, recording, for, a, solo, or, to, punctuate, a, particular, place, in, a, song, or, tune, where, i, wouldn, t, be, obliterating, someone, s, solo, another, bluegrass, method, learn, to, play, bluegrass, bass, by, earl, gately, also, teaches, bluegrass, slap, bass, technique, german, bassist, didi, beck, plays, rapid, triplet, slaps, as, demonstrated, in, this, video, in, the, early, 1950s, the, upright, bass, was, the, standard, bass, instrument, in, the, emerging, style, of, rock, and, roll, music, marshall, lytle, of, bill, haley, his, comets, being, but, one, example, in, the, 1940s, a, new, style, of, dance, music, called, rhythm, and, blues, developed, incorporating, elements, of, the, earlier, styles, of, blues, and, swing, louis, jordan, the, first, innovator, of, this, style, featured, an, upright, bass, in, his, group, the, tympany, five, the, upright, bass, remained, an, integral, part, of, pop, lineups, throughout, the, 1950s, as, the, new, genre, of, rock, and, roll, was, built, largely, upon, the, model, of, rhythm, and, blues, with, strong, elements, also, derived, from, jazz, country, and, bluegrass, however, upright, bass, players, using, their, instruments, in, these, contexts, faced, inherent, problems, they, were, forced, to, compete, with, louder, horn, instruments, and, later, amplified, electric, guitars, making, bass, parts, difficult, to, hear, the, upright, bass, is, difficult, to, amplify, in, loud, concert, venue, settings, because, it, can, be, prone, to, feedback, howls, as, well, the, upright, bass, is, large, and, awkward, to, transport, which, also, created, transportation, problems, for, touring, bands, in, some, groups, the, slap, bass, was, utilized, as, band, percussion, in, lieu, of, a, drummer, such, was, the, case, with, bill, haley, his, saddlemen, the, forerunner, group, to, the, comets, which, did, not, use, drummers, on, recordings, and, live, performances, until, late, 1952, prior, to, this, the, slap, bass, was, relied, on, for, percussion, including, on, recordings, such, as, haley, s, versions, of, rock, the, joint, and, rocket, 88, in, 1951, leo, fender, released, his, precision, bass, the, first, commercially, successful, electric, bass, guitar, the, electric, bass, was, easily, amplified, with, its, built, in, magnetic, pickups, easily, portable, less, than, a, foot, longer, than, an, electric, guitar, and, easier, to, play, in, tune, than, an, upright, bass, thanks, to, the, metal, frets, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, bands, were, playing, at, louder, volumes, and, performing, in, larger, venues, the, electric, bass, was, able, to, provide, the, huge, highly, amplified, stadium, filling, bass, tone, that, the, pop, and, rock, music, of, this, era, demanded, and, the, upright, bass, receded, from, the, limelight, of, the, popular, music, scene, the, upright, bass, began, making, a, comeback, in, popular, music, in, the, mid, 1980s, in, part, due, to, a, renewed, interest, in, earlier, forms, of, folk, and, country, music, as, part, of, the, roots, rock, and, americana, trends, in, the, 1990s, improvements, in, pickups, and, amplifier, designs, for, electro, acoustic, horizontal, and, upright, basses, made, it, easier, for, bassists, to, get, a, good, clear, amplified, tone, from, an, acoustic, instrument, some, popular, bands, decided, to, anchor, their, sound, with, an, upright, bass, instead, of, an, electric, bass, such, as, the, barenaked, ladies, a, trend, for, unplugged, performances, on, mtv, in, which, rock, bands, performed, with, solely, acoustic, instruments, further, helped, to, enhance, the, public, s, interest, in, the, upright, bass, and, acoustic, bass, guitars, jim, creeggan, of, barenaked, ladies, primarily, plays, upright, bass, although, he, has, increasingly, played, bass, guitar, throughout, the, band, s, career, chris, wyse, of, alternative, rock, group, owl, uses, a, combination, of, electric, and, double, bass, athol, guy, of, the, australian, folk, pop, group, the, seekers, plays, an, upright, bass, shannon, birchall, of, the, australian, folk, rock, group, the, john, butler, trio, makes, extensive, use, of, upright, basses, performing, extended, live, solos, in, songs, such, as, betterman, on, the, 2008, album, in, ear, park, by, the, indie, pop, band, department, of, eagles, a, bowed, upright, bass, is, featured, quite, prominently, on, the, songs, teenagers, and, in, ear, park, norwegian, ompa, rock, band, kaizers, orchestra, use, the, upright, bass, exclusively, both, live, and, on, their, recordings, french, contemporary, pop, duet, what, a, day, uses, double, bass, extended, pizzicato, technique, with, vocals, and, type, writer, hank, williams, iii, s, bass, players, jason, brown, joe, buck, and, zach, shedd, most, notably, have, used, upright, basses, for, recording, as, well, as, during, the, country, and, hellbilly, sets, of, hank, iii, s, live, performances, before, switching, to, electric, bass, for, the, assjack, set, the, late, 1970s, rockabilly, punk, genre, of, psychobilly, continued, and, expanded, upon, the, rockabilly, tradition, of, slap, bass, bassists, such, as, kim, nekroman, and, geoff, kresge, have, developed, the, ability, to, play, rapid, slap, bass, that, in, effect, turns, the, bass, into, a, percussion, instrument, in, popular, music, genres, the, instrument, is, usually, played, with, amplification, and, almost, exclusively, played, with, the, fingers, pizzicato, style, the, pizzicato, style, varies, between, different, players, and, genres, some, players, perform, with, the, sides, of, one, two, or, three, fingers, especially, for, walking, basslines, and, slow, tempo, ballads, because, this, is, purported, to, create, a, stronger, and, more, solid, tone, some, players, use, the, more, nimble, tips, of, the, fingers, to, play, fast, moving, solo, passages, or, to, pluck, lightly, for, quiet, tunes, the, use, of, amplification, allows, the, player, to, have, more, control, over, the, tone, of, the, instrument, because, amplifiers, have, equalization, controls, that, allow, the, bassist, to, accentuate, certain, frequencies, often, the, bass, frequencies, while, de, accentuating, some, frequencies, often, the, high, frequencies, so, that, there, is, less, finger, noise, an, unamplified, acoustic, bass, s, tone, is, limited, by, the, frequency, responsiveness, of, the, instrument, s, hollow, body, which, means, that, the, very, low, pitches, may, not, be, as, loud, as, the, higher, pitches, with, an, amplifier, and, equalization, devices, a, bass, player, can, boost, the, low, frequencies, which, changes, the, frequency, response, in, addition, the, use, of, an, amplifier, can, increase, the, sustain, of, the, instrument, which, is, particularly, useful, for, accompaniment, during, ballads, and, for, melodic, solos, with, held, notes, in, traditional, jazz, swing, polka, rockabilly, and, psychobilly, music, it, is, sometimes, played, in, the, slap, style, this, is, a, vigorous, version, of, pizzicato, where, the, strings, are, slapped, against, the, fingerboard, between, the, main, notes, of, the, bass, line, producing, a, snare, drum, like, percussive, sound, the, main, notes, are, either, played, normally, or, by, pulling, the, string, away, from, the, fingerboard, and, releasing, it, so, that, it, bounces, off, the, fingerboard, producing, a, distinctive, percussive, attack, in, addition, to, the, expected, pitch, notable, slap, style, bass, players, whose, use, of, the, technique, was, often, highly, syncopated, and, virtuosic, sometimes, interpolated, two, three, four, or, more, slaps, in, between, notes, of, the, bass, line, some, of, the, most, influential, contemporary, classical, double, bass, players, are, known, as, much, for,
