william, shakespeare, 1564, 1616, wrote, sonnets, on, a, variety, of, themes, when, discussing, or, referring, to, shakespeare, s, sonnets, it, is, almost, always, a, reference, to, the, 154, sonnets, that, were, first, published, all, together, in, a, quarto, in, 1609, however, there, are, six, additional, sonnets, that, shakespeare, wrote, and, included, in, the, plays, romeo, and, juliet, henry, v, and, love, s, labour, s, lost, there, is, also, a, partial, sonnet, found, in, the, play, edward, iii, shakespeare, s, sonnets, are, considered, a, continuation, of, the, sonnet, tradition, that, swept, through, the, renaissance, from, petrarch, in, 14th, century, italy, and, was, finally, introduced, in, 16th, century, england, by, thomas, wyatt, and, was, given, its, rhyming, metre, and, division, into, quatrains, by, henry, howard, with, few, exceptions, shakespeare, s, sonnets, observe, the, stylistic, form, of, the, english, sonnet, the, rhyme, scheme, the, 14, lines, and, the, metre, but, shakespeare, s, sonnets, introduce, significant, departures, of, content, instead, of, expressing, worshipful, love, for, an, almost, goddess, like, yet, unobtainable, female, love, object, as, petrarch, dante, and, philip, sidney, had, done, shakespeare, introduces, a, young, man, he, also, introduces, the, dark, lady, shakespeare, explores, themes, such, as, lust, homoeroticism, misogyny, infidelity, and, acrimony, the, primary, source, of, shakespeare, s, sonnets, is, a, quarto, published, in, 1609, titled, shake, speare, s, sonnets, it, contains, 154, sonnets, which, are, followed, by, the, long, poem, a, lover, s, complaint, thirteen, copies, of, the, quarto, have, survived, in, fairly, good, shape, there, is, evidence, in, a, note, on, the, title, page, of, one, of, the, extant, copies, that, the, great, elizabethan, actor, edward, alleyn, bought, a, copy, in, june, 1609, for, one, shilling, 6, the, sonnets, cover, such, themes, as, the, passage, of, time, love, infidelity, jealousy, beauty, and, mortality, the, first, 126, are, addressed, to, a, young, man, the, last, 28, are, either, addressed, to, or, refer, to, a, woman, sonnets, 138, and, 144, had, previously, been, published, in, the, 1599, miscellany, the, passionate, pilgrim, the, title, of, the, quarto, shake, speare, s, sonnets, is, consistent, with, the, entry, in, the, stationers, register, the, title, appears, in, upper, case, lettering, on, the, title, page, where, it, is, followed, by, the, phrase, neuer, before, imprinted, the, title, also, appears, every, time, the, quarto, is, opened, that, the, author, s, name, in, a, possessive, form, is, part, of, the, title, sets, it, apart, from, all, other, sonnet, collections, of, the, time, except, for, one, sir, philip, sidney, s, posthumous, 1591, publication, that, is, titled, syr, p, s, his, astrophel, and, stella, which, is, considered, one, of, shakespeare, s, most, important, models, sidney, s, title, may, have, inspired, shakespeare, particularly, if, the, w, h, of, shakespeare, s, dedication, is, sidney, s, nephew, and, heir, william, herbert, the, idea, that, the, persona, referred, to, as, the, speaker, of, shakespeare, s, sonnets, might, be, shakespeare, himself, is, aggressively, repudiated, by, scholars, however, the, title, of, the, quarto, does, seem, to, encourage, that, kind, of, speculation, 85, the, first, 17, poems, traditionally, called, the, procreation, sonnets, are, addressed, to, the, young, man, urging, him, to, marry, and, have, children, in, order, to, immortalize, his, beauty, by, passing, it, to, the, next, generation, other, sonnets, express, the, speaker, s, love, for, the, young, man, brood, upon, loneliness, death, and, the, transience, of, life, seem, to, criticise, the, young, man, for, preferring, a, rival, poet, express, ambiguous, feelings, for, the, speaker, s, mistress, and, pun, on, the, poet, s, name, the, final, two, sonnets, are, allegorical, treatments, of, greek, epigrams, referring, to, the, little, love, god, cupid, the, publisher, thomas, thorpe, entered, the, book, in, the, stationers, register, on, 20, may, 1609, whether, thorpe, used, an, authorised, manuscript, from, shakespeare, or, an, unauthorised, copy, is, unknown, george, eld, printed, the, quarto, and, the, run, was, divided, between, the, booksellers, william, aspley, and, john, wright, shakespeare, s, sonnets, include, a, dedication, to, mr, w, h, to, the, onlie, begetter, of, these, insuing, sonnets, mr, w, h, all, happinesse, and, that, eternitie, promised, by, our, ever, living, poet, wisheth, the, well, wishing, adventurer, in, setting, forth, the, upper, case, letters, and, the, stops, that, follow, each, word, of, the, dedication, were, probably, intended, to, resemble, an, ancient, roman, lapidary, inscription, or, monumental, brass, perhaps, accentuating, the, declaration, in, sonnet, 55, that, the, work, would, confer, immortality, to, the, subjects, of, the, work, not, marble, nor, the, gilded, monuments, of, princes, shall, outlive, this, pow, rful, rhyme, the, initials, t, t, are, taken, to, refer, to, the, publisher, thomas, thorpe, thorpe, usually, signed, prefatory, matter, only, if, the, author, was, out, of, the, country, or, dead, which, suggests, that, shakespeare, was, not, in, london, during, the, last, stage, of, printing, however, thorpe, s, entire, corpus, of, such, consists, of, only, four, dedications, and, three, prefaces, it, has, been, suggested, that, thorpe, signing, the, dedication, rather, than, the, author, might, indicate, that, thorpe, published, the, work, without, obtaining, shakespeare, s, permission, though, thorpe, s, taking, on, the, dedication, may, be, explained, by, the, great, demands, of, business, and, travel, that, shakespeare, was, facing, at, this, time, which, may, have, caused, him, to, deal, with, the, printing, production, in, haste, before, rushing, out, of, town, after, all, may, 1609, was, an, extraordinary, time, that, month, saw, a, serious, outbreak, of, the, plague, which, shut, down, the, theatres, and, also, caused, many, to, flee, london, plus, shakespeare, s, theatre, company, was, on, tour, from, ipswich, to, oxford, in, addition, shakespeare, had, been, away, from, stratford, and, in, the, same, month, may, was, being, called, on, to, tend, to, family, and, business, there, and, deal, with, the, litigation, of, a, lawsuit, in, warwickshire, that, involved, a, substantial, amount, of, money, the, identity, of, mr, w, h, the, only, begetter, of, shakespeare, s, sonnets, is, not, known, for, certain, his, identity, has, been, the, subject, of, a, great, amount, of, speculation, that, he, was, the, author, s, patron, that, he, was, both, patron, and, the, faire, youth, who, is, addressed, in, the, sonnets, that, the, faire, youth, is, based, on, mr, w, h, in, some, sonnets, but, not, others, and, a, number, of, other, ideas, 51, 55, 63, 68, william, herbert, the, earl, of, pembroke, is, seen, as, perhaps, the, most, likely, identity, of, mr, w, h, and, the, young, man, he, was, the, dedicatee, of, the, first, folio, thorpe, would, have, been, unlikely, to, have, addressed, a, lord, as, mr, but, there, may, be, an, explanation, perhaps, that, form, of, address, came, from, the, author, who, wanted, to, refer, to, herbert, at, an, earlier, time, when, herbert, was, a, younger, man, there, is, a, later, dedication, to, herbert, in, another, quarto, of, verse, ben, jonson, s, epigrammes, 1616, in, which, the, text, of, jonson, s, dedication, begins, my, lord, while, you, cannot, change, your, merit, i, dare, not, change, your, title, jonson, s, emphasis, on, pembroke, s, title, and, his, comment, seem, to, be, chiding, someone, else, who, had, the, audacity, to, use, the, wrong, title, as, perhaps, is, the, case, in, shakespeare, s, dedication, 60, henry, wriothesley, the, earl, of, southampton, with, initials, reversed, has, received, a, great, deal, of, consideration, as, a, likely, possibility, he, was, the, dedicatee, of, shakespeare, s, poems, venus, and, adonis, and, the, rape, of, lucrece, southampton, was, also, known, for, his, good, looks, other, suggestions, include, the, sonnets, are, almost, all, constructed, using, three, quatrains, four, line, stanzas, followed, by, a, final, couplet, the, sonnets, are, composed, in, iambic, pentameter, the, metre, used, in, shakespeare, s, plays, the, rhyme, scheme, is, abab, cdcd, efef, gg, sonnets, using, this, scheme, are, known, as, shakespearean, sonnets, or, english, sonnets, or, elizabethan, sonnets, often, at, the, end, of, the, third, quatrain, occurs, the, volta, turn, where, the, mood, of, the, poem, shifts, and, the, poet, expresses, a, turn, of, thought, the, exceptions, are, sonnets, 99, 126, and, 145, number, 99, has, fifteen, lines, number, 126, consists, of, six, couplets, and, two, blank, lines, marked, with, italic, brackets, 145, is, in, iambic, tetrameters, not, pentameters, in, one, other, variation, on, the, standard, structure, found, for, example, in, sonnet, 29, the, rhyme, scheme, is, changed, by, repeating, the, second, b, rhyme, of, quatrain, one, as, the, second, f, rhyme, of, quatrain, three, apart, from, rhyme, and, considering, only, the, arrangement, of, ideas, and, the, placement, of, the, volta, a, number, of, sonnets, maintain, the, two, part, organization, of, the, italian, sonnet, in, that, case, the, term, octave, and, sestet, are, commonly, used, to, refer, to, the, sonnet, s, first, eight, lines, followed, by, the, remaining, six, lines, there, are, other, line, groupings, as, well, as, shakespeare, finds, inventive, ways, with, the, content, of, the, fourteen, line, poems, when, analysed, as, characters, the, subjects, of, the, sonnets, are, usually, referred, to, as, the, fair, youth, the, rival, poet, and, the, dark, lady, the, speaker, expresses, admiration, for, the, fair, youth, s, beauty, and, if, reading, the, sonnets, in, chronological, order, as, published, later, has, an, affair, with, the, dark, lady, then, so, does, the, fair, youth, current, linguistic, analysis, and, historical, evidence, suggests, however, that, the, sonnets, to, the, dark, lady, were, composed, first, around, 1591, 95, the, procreation, sonnets, next, and, the, later, sonnets, to, the, fair, youth, last, 1597, 1603, it, is, not, known, whether, the, poems, and, their, characters, are, fiction, or, autobiographical, scholars, who, find, the, sonnets, to, be, autobiographical, have, attempted, to, identify, the, characters, with, historical, individuals, the, fair, youth, is, the, unnamed, young, man, addressed, by, the, devoted, poet, in, the, greatest, sequence, of, the, sonnets, 1, 126, the, young, man, is, handsome, self, centred, universally, admired, and, much, sought, after, the, sequence, begins, with, the, poet, urging, the, young, man, to, marry, and, father, children, sonnets, 1, 17, it, continues, with, the, friendship, developing, with, the, poet, s, loving, admiration, which, at, times, is, homoerotic, in, nature, then, comes, a, set, of, betrayals, by, the, young, man, as, he, is, seduced, by, the, dark, lady, and, they, maintain, a, liaison, sonnets, 133, 134, 144, all, of, which, the, poet, struggles, to, abide, it, concludes, with, the, poet, s, own, act, of, betrayal, resulting, in, his, independence, from, the, fair, youth, sonnet, 152, 93, the, identity, of, the, fair, youth, has, been, the, subject, of, speculation, among, scholars, one, popular, theory, is, that, he, was, henry, wriothesley, the, 3rd, earl, of, southampton, this, is, based, in, part, on, the, idea, that, his, physical, features, age, and, personality, might, fairly, match, the, young, man, in, the, sonnets, he, was, both, an, admirer, and, patron, of, shakespeare, and, was, considered, one, of, the, most, prominent, nobles, of, the, period, it, is, also, noted, that, shakespeare, s, 1593, poem, venus, and, adonis, is, dedicated, to, southampton, and, in, that, poem, a, young, man, adonis, is, encouraged, by, the, goddess, of, love, venus, to, beget, a, child, which, is, a, theme, in, the, sonnets, here, are, the, verses, from, venus, and, adonis, a, problem, with, identifying, the, fair, youth, with, southampton, is, that, the, most, certainly, datable, events, referred, to, in, the, sonnets, are, the, fall, of, essex, and, then, the, gunpowder, plotters, executions, in, 1606, which, puts, southampton, at, the, age, of, 33, and, then, 39, when, the, sonnets, were, published, when, he, would, be, past, the, age, when, he, would, be, referred, to, as, a, lovely, boy, or, fair, youth, 52, authors, such, as, thomas, tyrwhitt, and, oscar, wilde, proposed, that, the, fair, youth, was, william, hughes, a, seductive, young, actor, who, played, female, roles, in, shakespeare, s, plays, particularly, wilde, claimed, that, he, was, the, mr, w, h, referred, to, in, the, dedication, attached, to, the, manuscript, of, the, sonnets, the, dark, lady, sequence, sonnets, 127, 152, is, the, most, defiant, of, the, sonnet, tradition, the, sequence, distinguishes, itself, from, the, fair, youth, sequence, with, its, overt, sexuality, sonnet, 151, the, dark, lady, is, so, called, because, she, has, black, hair, and, dun, skin, the, dark, lady, suddenly, appears, sonnet, 127, and, she, and, the, speaker, of, the, sonnets, the, poet, are, in, a, sexual, relationship, she, is, not, aristocratic, young, beautiful, intelligent, or, chaste, her, complexion, is, muddy, her, breath, reeks, and, she, is, ungainly, when, she, walks, the, relationship, strongly, parallels, touchstone, s, pursuit, of, audrey, in, as, you, like, it, the, dark, lady, presents, an, adequate, receptor, for, male, desire, she, is, celebrated, in, cocky, terms, that, would, be, offensive, to, her, not, that, she, would, be, able, to, read, or, understand, what, is, said, soon, the, speaker, rebukes, her, for, enslaving, his, fair, friend, sonnet, 133, he, can, t, abide, the, triangular, relationship, and, it, ends, with, him, rejecting, her, as, with, the, fair, youth, there, have, been, many, attempts, to, identify, her, with, a, real, historical, individual, lucy, negro, mary, fitton, emilia, lanier, elizabeth, wriothesley, and, others, have, been, suggested, the, rival, poet, s, identity, remains, a, mystery, if, shakespeare, s, patron, and, friend, was, pembroke, shakespeare, was, not, the, only, poet, who, praised, his, beauty, francis, davison, did, in, a, sonnet, that, is, the, preface, to, davison, s, quarto, a, poetical, rhapsody, 1608, which, was, published, just, before, shakespeare, s, sonnets, john, davies, of, hereford, samuel, daniel, george, chapman, christopher, marlowe, and, ben, jonson, are, also, candidates, that, find, support, among, clues, in, the, sonnets, it, may, be, that, the, rival, poet, is, a, composite, of, several, poets, through, which, shakespeare, explores, his, sense, of, being, threatened, by, competing, poets, the, speaker, sees, the, rival, poet, as, competition, for, fame, and, patronage, the, sonnets, most, commonly, identified, as, the, rival, poet, group, exist, within, the, fair, youth, sequence, in, sonnets, 78, 86, a, lover, s, complaint, is, part, two, of, the, quarto, published, in, 1609, it, is, not, written, in, the, sonnet, form, but, is, composed, of, 47, seven, line, stanzas, written, in, rhyme, royal, it, is, an, example, of, a, normal, feature, of, the, two, part, poetic, form, in, which, the, first, part, expresses, the, male, point, of, view, and, the, second, part, contrasts, or, complements, the, first, part, with, the, female, s, point, of, view, the, first, part, of, the, quarto, the, 154, sonnets, considers, frustrated, male, desire, and, the, second, part, a, lover, s, complaint, expresses, the, misery, of, a, woman, victimized, by, male, desire, the, earliest, elizabethan, example, of, this, two, part, structure, is, samuel, daniel, s, delia, with, the, complaint, of, rosamund, 1592, a, sonnet, sequence, that, tells, the, story, of, a, woman, being, threatened, by, a, man, of, higher, rank, followed, by, the, woman, s, complaint, this, was, imitated, by, other, poets, including, shakespeare, with, his, rape, of, lucrece, the, last, lines, of, which, contain, lucrece, s, complaint, other, examples, are, found, in, the, works, of, michael, drayton, thomas, lodge, richard, barnfield, and, others, the, young, man, of, the, sonnets, and, the, young, man, of, a, lover, s, complaint, provide, a, thematic, link, between, the, two, parts, in, each, part, the, young, man, is, handsome, wealthy, and, promiscuous, unreliable, and, admired, by, all, 89, like, the, sonnets, a, lover, s, complaint, also, has, a, possessive, form, in, its, title, which, is, followed, by, its, own, assertion, of, the, author, s, name, this, time, the, possessive, word, lover, s, refers, to, a, woman, who, becomes, the, primary, speaker, of, the, work, 85, a, lover, s, complaint, begins, with, a, young, woman, weeping, at, the, edge, of, a, river, into, which, she, throws, torn, up, letters, rings, and, other, tokens, of, love, an, old, man, nearby, approaches, her, and, asks, the, reason, for, her, sorrow, she, responds, by, telling, him, of, a, former, lover, who, pursued, seduced, and, finally, abandoned, her, she, recounts, in, detail, the, speech, her, lover, gave, to, her, which, seduced, her, she, concludes, her, story, by, conceding, that, she, would, fall, for, the, young, man, s, false, charms, again, as, the, soule, of, euphorbus, was, thought, to, live, in, pythagoras, so, the, sweete, wittie, soule, of, ouid, liues, in, mellifluous, hony, tongued, shakespeare, witnes, his, venus, and, adonis, his, lucrece, his, sugred, sonnets, among, his, private, friends, c, in, his, plays, shakespeare, himself, seemed, to, be, a, satiric, critic, of, sonnets, the, allusions, to, them, are, often, scornful, then, he, went, on, to, create, one, of, the, longest, sonnet, sequences, of, his, era, a, sequence, that, took, some, sharp, turns, away, from, the, tradition, 44, he, may, have, been, inspired, out, of, literary, ambition, and, a, desire, to, carve, new, paths, apart, from, the, well, worn, tradition, or, he, may, have, been, inspired, by, biographical, elements, in, his, life, it, is, thought, that, the, biographical, aspects, have, been, over, explored, and, over, speculated, on, especially, in, the, face, of, a, paucity, of, evidence, 45, the, critical, focus, has, turned, instead, through, new, criticism, and, by, scholars, such, as, stephen, booth, and, helen, vendler, to, the, text, itself, which, is, studied, and, appreciated, linguistically, as, a, highly, complex, structure, of, language, and, ideas, besides, the, biographic, and, the, linguistic, approaches, another, way, of, considering, shakespeare, s, sonnets, is, in, the, context, of, the, culture, and, literature, that, surrounds, them, gerald, hammond, in, his, book, the, reader, and, the, young, man, sonnets, suggests, that, the, non, expert, reader, who, is, thoughtful, and, engaged, does, not, need, that, much, help, in, understanding, the, sonnets, though, he, states, the, reader, may, often, feel, mystified, when, trying, to, decide, for, example, if, a, word, or, passage, has, a, concrete, meaning, or, an, abstract, meaning, laying, that, kind, of, perplexity, in, the, reader, s, path, for, the, reader, to, deal, with, is, an, essential, part, of, reading, the, sonnets, the, reader, doesn, t, always, benefit, from, having, knots, untangled, and, double, meanings, simplified, by, the, experts, according, to, hammond, during, the, eighteenth, century, the, sonnets, reputation, in, england, was, relatively, low, in, 1805, the, critical, review, credited, john, milton, with, the, perfection, of, the, english, sonnet, towards, the, end, of, the, nineteenth, century, shakespeare, and, milton, seemed, to, be, on, an, equal, footing, but, critics, burdened, by, an, over, emphasis, on, biographical, explorations, continued, to, contend, with, each, other, for, decades, on, this, point, 78, 79, like, all, shakespeare, s, works, shakespeare, s, sonnets, have, been, reprinted, many, times, prominent, editions, include, zinman, ira, ed, 2009, shakespeare, s, sonnets, and, the, bible, foreword, by, hrh, charles, prince, of, wales, bloomington, world, wisdom, isbn, 978, 1933316758, there, are, sonnets, written, by, shakespeare, that, occur, in, his, plays, and, these, include, his, earliest, sonnets, they, differ, from, the, 154, sonnets, published, in, the, 1609, because, they, may, lack, the, deep, introspection, for, example, and, they, are, written, to, serve, the, needs, of, a, performance, exposition, or, narrative, in, shakespeare, s, early, comedies, the, sonnets, and, sonnet, making, of, his, characters, are, often, objects, of, satire, in, two, gentlemen, of, verona, sonnet, writing, is, portrayed, cynically, as, a, seduction, technique, in, love, s, labour, s, lost, sonnets, are, portrayed, as, evidence, that, love, can, render, men, weak, and, foolish, in, much, ado, about, nothing, beatrice, and, benedick, each, write, a, sonnet, which, serves, as, proof, that, they, have, fallen, in, love, in, all, s, well, that, ends, well, a, partial, sonnet, is, read, and, bertram, comments, he, shall, be, whipp, d, through, the, army, with, this, rhyme, in, s, forehead, in, henry, v, the, dauphin, suggests, he, will, compose, a, sonnet, to, his, horse, the, sonnets, that, shakespeare, satirizes, in, his, plays, are, sonnets, written, in, the, tradition, of, petrarch, and, sidney, whereas, shakespeare, s, sonnets, published, in, the, quarto, of, 1609, take, a, radical, turn, away, from, that, older, style, and, have, none, of, the, lovelorn, qualities, that, are, mocked, in, the, plays, the, sonnets, published, in, 1609, seem, to, be, rebelling, against, the, tradition, 44, 45, in, the, play, love, s, labour, s, lost, the, king, and, his, three, lords, have, all, vowed, to, live, like, monks, to, study, to, give, up, worldly, things, and, to, see, no, women, all, of, them, break, the, last, part, of, the, vow, by, falling, in, love, the, lord, longaville, expresses, his, love, in, a, sonnet, did, not, the, heavenly, rhetoric, of, thine, eye, and, the, lord, berowne, does, too, a, hexameter, sonnet, if, love, make, me, forsworn, how, shall, i, swear, to, love, a, form, sidney, uses, in, six, of, the, sonnets, in, astrophel, and, stella, numbers, 1, 6, 8, 76, and, 102, these, sonnets, contain, comic, imperfections, including, awkward, phrasing, and, problems, with, the, meter, after, berowne, is, caught, breaking, his, vow, and, exposed, by, the, sonnet, he, composed, he, passionately, renounces, speech, that, is, affected, and, vows, to, prefer, plain, country, speech, ironically, when, proclaiming, this, he, demonstrates, that, he, can, t, seem, to, avoid, rich, courtly, language, and, his, speech, happens, to, fall, into, the, meter, and, rhyme, of, a, sonnet, o, never, will, i, trust, to, speeches, penned, the, epilogue, at, the, end, of, the, play, henry, v, is, written, in, the, form, of, a, sonnet, thus, far, with, rough, and, all, unable, pen, formal, epilogues, were, established, as, a, theatrical, tradition, and, occur, in, 13, of, shakespeare, s, plays, in, henry, v, the, character, of, chorus, who, has, addressed, the, audience, a, few, times, during, the, play, speaks, the, wide, ranging, epilogue, sonnet, it, begins, by, allowing, that, the, play, may, not, have, presented, the, story, in, its, full, glory, it, points, out, that, the, next, king, would, be, henry,
