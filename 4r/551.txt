christianity, though, other, definitions, are, possible, it, is, to, make, imagery, of, the, different, beliefs, in, the, world, and, what, it, looks, like, most, christian, groups, use, or, have, used, art, to, some, extent, although, some, have, had, strong, objections, to, some, forms, of, religious, image, and, there, have, been, major, periods, of, iconoclasm, within, christianity, most,

century, until, the, adoption, of, christianity, by, constantine, christian, art, derived, its, style, and, much, of, its, iconography, from, popular, roman, art, but, from, this, point, grand, christian, buildings, built, under, imperial, patronage, brought, a, need, for, christian, versions, of, roman, elite, and, official, art, of, which, mosaics, in, churches, in, rome, are, the, most, prominent, surviving, examples, christian, art, would, soon, become, the, foundation, of, churches, across, europe, stained, glass, windows, often, depict, biblical, scenes, to, be, reflected, across, the, inner, workings, of, the, building, murals, and, altarpiece, art, also, fill, churches, with, intricate, and, expressive, christian, images, during, the, development, of, early, christian, art, in, the, byzantine, empire, see, byzantine, art, a, more, abstract, aesthetic, replaced, the, naturalism, previously, established, in, hellenistic, art, this, new, style, was, hieratic, meaning, its, primary, purpose, was, to, convey, religious, meaning, rather, than, accurately, render, objects, and, people, realistic, perspective, proportions, light, and, colour, were, ignored, in, favour, of, geometric, simplification, of, forms, reverse, perspective, and, standardized, conventions, to, portray, individuals, and, events, the, controversy, over, the, use, of, graven, images, the, interpretation, of, the, second, commandment, and, the, crisis, of, byzantine, iconoclasm, led, to, a, standardization, of, religious, imagery, within, the, eastern, orthodoxy, the, renaissance, saw, an, increase, in, monumental, secular, works, but, until, the, protestant, reformation, christian, art, continued, to, be, produced, in, great, quantities, both, for, churches, and, clergy, and, for, the, laity, during, this, time, michelangelo, buonarroti, painted, the, sistine, chapel, and, carved, the, famous, piet, gianlorenzo, bernini, created, the, massive, columns, in, st, peter, s,

virtual, halt, in, protestant, countries, and, causing, the, destruction, of, most, of, the, art, that, already, existed, as, a, secular, non, sectarian, universal, notion, of, art, arose, in, 19th, century, western, europe, secular, artists, occasionally, treated, christian, themes, bouguereau, manet, only, rarely, was, a, christian, artist, included, in, the, historical, canon, such, as, rouault, or, stanley, spencer, however, many, modern, artists, such, as, eric, gill, marc, chagall, henri, matisse, jacob, epstein, elisabeth, frink, and, graham, sutherland, have, produced, well, known, works, of, art, for, churches, through, a, social, interpretation, of, christianity, fritz, von, uhde, also, revived, the, interest, in, sacred, art, through, the, depiction, of, jesus, in, ordinary, places, in, life, since, the, advent, of, printing, the, sale, of, reproductions, of, pious, works, has, been, a, major, element, of, popular, christian, culture, in, the, 19th, century, this, included, genre, painters, such, as, mih, ly, munk, csy, the, invention, of, color, lithography, led, to, broad, circulation, of, holy, cards, in, the, modern, era, companies, specializing, in, modern, commercial, christian, artists, such, as, thomas, blackshear, and, thomas, kinkade, although, widely, regarded, in, the, fine, art, world, as, kitsch, have, been, very, successful, the, last, part, of, the, 20th, and, the, first, part, of, the, 21st, century, have, seen, a, focused, effort, by, artists, who, claim, faith, in, christ, to, re, establish, art, with, themes, that, revolve, around, faith, christ, god, the, church, the, bible, and, other, classic, christian, themes, as, worthy, of, respect, by, the, secular, art, world, art, could, then, be, used, to, cultivate, the, church, to, participate, in, christianity, once, again, artists, such, as, makoto, fujimura, have, had, significant, influence, both, in, sacred, and, secular, arts, other, notable, artists, include, larry, d, alexander, gary, p, bergel, carlos, cazares, bruce, herman, deborah, sokolove, and, john, august, swanson, confucian, art, is, inspired, by, confucianism, coined, after, the, chinese, philosopher, and, politician, confucius, confucian, art, originated, in, china, then, spread, westwards, on, the, silk, road, southward, down, to, southern, china, and, then, onto, southeast, asia, and, eastwards, through, northern, china, on, to, japan, and, korea, while, it, still, maintains, a, strong, influence, within, indonesia, confucian, influence, on, western, art, has, been, limited, while, confucian, themes, enjoyed, representation, in, chinese, art, centers, they, are, fewer, in, comparison, to, the, number, of, artworks, that, are, about, or, influenced, by, daoism, and, buddhism, prior, to, the, han, dynasty, the, chinese, art, hierarchy, considered, music, as, the, highest, form, of, art, and, dismissed, calligraphy, poetry, and, painting, as, art, forms, and, craft, practiced, by, the, lower, class, nevertheless, poetry, was, also, popular, during, confucius, s, time, and, poetry, was, both, praised, and, ranked, high, in, status, with, music, according, to, confucius, and, his, disciples, music, strives, to, create, and, reflect, harmony, in, the, world, hence, education, should, begin, with, the, foundations, of, poetry, and, moral, behavior, and, conclude, with, music, over, time, the, development, of, the, chinese, writing, system, promoted, the, growth, of, calligraphy, and, visual, arts, in, terms, of, social, status, confucian, aesthetics, and, values, further, contributed, to, the, development, of, these, visual, art, forms, with, landscape, paintings, and, calligraphy, works, centralizing, on, the, written, works, and, teachings, of, confucianism, hinduism, with, its, 1, billion, followers, it, makes, up, about, 15, of, the, world, s, population, and, as, such, the, culture, that, ensues, it, is, full, of, different, aspects, of, life, that, are, effected, by, art, there, are, 64, traditional, arts, that, are, followed, that, start, with, the, classics, of, music, and, range, all, the, way, to, the, application, and, adornment, of, jewellery, since, religion, and, culture, are, inseparable, with, hinduism, recurring, symbols, such, as, the, gods, and, their, reincarnations, the, lotus, flower, extra, limbs, and, even, the, traditional, arts, make, their, appearances, in, many, sculptures, paintings, music, and, dance, a, prohibition, against, depicting, representational, images, in, religious, art, as, well, as, the, naturally, decorative, nature, of, arabic, script, led, to, the, use, of, calligraphic, decorations, which, usually, involved, repeating, geometrical, patterns, and, vegetal, forms, arabesques, that, expressed, ideals, of, order, and, nature, these, were, used, on, religious, architecture, carpets, and, handwritten, documents, islamic, art, has, reflected, this, balanced, harmonious, world, view, it, focuses, on, spiritual, essence, rather, than, physical, form, while, there, has, been, an, aversion, to, potential, idol, worship, through, islamic, history, this, is, a, distinctly, modern, sunni, view, persian, miniatures, along, with, medieval, depictions, of, muhammad, and, angels, in, islam, stand, as, prominent, examples, contrary, to, the, modern, sunni, tradition, also, shi, a, muslims, are, much, less, averse, to, the, depiction, of, figures, including, the, prophet, s, as, long, as, the, depiction, is, respectful, the, islamic, resistance, to, the, representation, of, living, beings, ultimately, stems, from, the, belief, that, the, creation, of, living, forms, is, unique, to, god, it, is, for, this, reason, that, the, role, of, images, and, image, makers, has, been, controversial, the, strongest, statements, on, the, subject, of, figural, depiction, are, made, in, the, hadith, traditions, of, the, prophet, where, painters, are, challenged, to, breathe, life, into, their, creations, and, threatened, with, punishment, on, the, day, of, judgment, the, qur, an, is, less, specific, but, condemns, idolatry, and, uses, the, arabic, term, musawwir, maker, of, forms, or, artist, as, an, epithet, for, god, partially, as, a, result, of, this, religious, sentiment, figures, in, painting, were, often, stylized, and, in, some, cases, the, destruction, of, figurative, artworks, occurred, iconoclasm, was, previously, known, in, the, byzantine, period, and, aniconicism, was, a, feature, of, the, judaic, world, thus, placing, the, islamic, objection, to, figurative, representations, within, a, larger, context, as, ornament, however, figures, were, largely, devoid, of, any, larger, significance, and, perhaps, therefore, posed, less, challenge, as, with, other, forms, of, islamic, ornamentation, artists, freely, adapted, and, stylized, basic, human, and, animal, forms, giving, rise, to, a, great, variety, of, figural, based, designs, arabesque, is, a, decorative, art, style, characterized, by, repetitive, intricate, patterns, of, intertwined, plants, and, abstract, curvilinear, motifs, it, is, believed, to, have, originated, in, the, islamic, world, and, its, use, spread, throughout, the, middle, east, europe, and, north, africa, it, has, played, an, important, role, in, islamic, art, often, serving, as, a, form, of, religious, expression, the, term, arabesque, is, a, french, term, derived, from, the, italian, word, arabesco, meaning, in, the, arabic, style, arabesque, patterns, can, be, found, in, various, media, including, ceramics, architecture, calligraphy, and, textiles, since, the, 19th, century, arabesque, art, has, been, highly, influential, in, western, art, and, design, with, many, designers, and, artists, incorporating, patterns, into, their, work, calligraphy, is, a, highly, regarded, element, of, islamic, art, the, qur, an, was, transmitted, in, arabic, and, inherent, within, the, arabic, script, is, the, potential, for, ornamental, forms, the, employment, of, calligraphy, as, ornament, had, a, definite, aesthetic, appeal, but, often, also, included, an, underlying, talismanic, component, while, most, works, of, art, had, legible, inscriptions, not, all, muslims, would, have, been, able, to, read, them, one, should, always, keep, in, mind, however, that, calligraphy, is, principally, a, means, to, transmit, a, text, albeit, in, a, decorative, form, from, its, simple, and, primitive, early, examples, of, the, 5th, and, 6th, century, ad, the, arabic, alphabet, developed, rapidly, after, the, rise, of, islam, in, the, 7th, century, into, a, beautiful, form, of, art, the, main, two, families, of, calligraphic, styles, were, the, dry, styles, called, generally, the, kufic, and, the, soft, cursive, styles, which, include, naskhi, thuluth, nastaliq, and, many, others, geometric, patterns, make, up, one, of, the, three, non, figural, types, of, decoration, in, islamic, art, whether, isolated, or, used, in, combination, with, non, figural, ornamentation, or, figural, representation, geometric, patterns, are, popularly, associated, with, islamic, art, largely, due, to, their, aniconic, quality, these, abstract, designs, not, only, adorn, the, surfaces, of, monumental, islamic, architecture, but, also, function, as, the, major, decorative, element, on, a, vast, array, of, objects, of, all, types, types, of, geometric, styles, geometric, patterns, are, frequently, associated, with, islamic, art, partly, because, of, their, iconic, appeal, whether, used, alone, or, in, conjunction, with, figural, depiction, or, non, configurable, adornment, these, abstract, patterns, are, used, as, the, primary, ornamental, feature, on, various, items, of, all, kinds, in, addition, to, adorning, the, surfaces, of, massive, islamic, buildings, although, geometric, ornamentation, may, have, peaked, in, the, islamic, world, the, greeks, romans, and, sasanians, in, iran, were, the, sources, for, geometric, shapes, and, elaborate, patterns, islamic, artists, incorporated, significant, components, of, the, classical, past, to, invent, a, new, form, of, decoration, that, highlighted, the, vitality, of, order, and, unity, islamic, astronomers, mathematicians, and, scientists, contributed, these, forms, which, were, crucial, for, their, type, of, art, style, history, and, design, geometric, shapes, resemble, the, arabesque, design, found, in, many, vegetal, designs, in, terms, of, its, abstraction, repeated, motifs, and, symmetry, geometric, designs, frequently, coexist, with, calligraphic, decoration, circles, and, interlaced, circles, squares, or, four, sided, polygons, are, the, typical, star, pattern, resulting, from, squares, and, triangles, inscribed, in, a, circle, multi, sided, polygons, are, the, four, fundamental, shapes, or, repeat, units, from, which, the, more, complex, patterns, are, built, it, is, evident, however, that, the, intricate, designs, found, on, several, things, come, in, various, sizes, and, configurations, making, them, suitable, for, inclusion, more, than, category, the, geometric, shape, of, the, circle, is, used, in, islamic, art, to, signify, the, fundamental, symbol, of, oneness, and, the, ultimate, course, of, all, diversity, in, creation, as, the, illustration, below, shows, many, classic, islamic, patterns, have, ritual, beginnings, in, the, circle, s, raw, partition, into, regular, sections, four, circle, divisions, resulted, in, the, above, pattern, created, in, yazd, iran, in, the, fifteenth, century, from, there, a, regular, grid, of, triangles, is, created, and, then, the, design, is, added, on, top, of, it, see, how, the, intricate, pattern, intertwines, with, the, fundamental, design, shown, in, the, images, above, as, a, white, outline, alhambra, palace, geometry, geometric, patterns, biomorphic, design, arabesque, and, calligraphy, are, expertly, combined, in, the, alhambra, in, spain, from, the, 14th, century, islamic, art, is, made, up, of, these, three, separate, but, complementary, fields, they, are, arranged, in, a, three, tiered, hierarchy, with, geometry, at, the, button, this, is, frequently, indicated, by, its, use, on, the, lower, portions, of, walls, or, floors, as, in, the, example, above, the, decorative, features, used, use, a, variety, of, symmetries, that, are, now, recognized, as, belonging, to, separate, mathematical, groups, yet, the, patterns, delicacy, and, elegance, are, unmatched, in, contemporary, mathematical, thought, although, it, was, once, customary, in, islam, to, use, geometric, shapes, these, designs, are, works, of, architecture, since, the, eighth, century, muslim, calligraphers, and, geometric, pattern, designers, have, decorated, mosques, castles, and, manuscripts, most, often, islamic, geometric, designs, are, employed, in, places, of, worship, as, a, way, to, exalt, god, grand, structures, made, by, divine, geometry, include, buildings, gardens, and, floors, the, blue, mosque, geometry, there, are, observable, patterns, spanning, a, thousand, years, of, islamic, history, and, throughout, the, entire, islamic, world, since, these, geometric, patterns, are, also, connected, to, islamic, culture, in, some, pieces, of, architecture, islamic, architects, follow, the, same, guidelines, such, as, in, the, blue, mosque, and, the, alhambra, in, granada, pictured, above, the, alhambra, palace, in, spain, and, the, samarkand, mosque, in, uzbekistan, are, just, two, examples, of, the, art, of, repeated, geometric, designs, that, can, be, seen, worldwide, jain, art, refers, to, religious, works, of, art, associated, with, jainism, even, though, jainism, spread, only, in, some, parts, of, india, it, has, made, a, significant, contribution, to, indian, art, and, architecture, mandaean, art, can, be, found, in, illustrated, manuscript, scrolls, called, diwan, mandaean, scroll, illustrations, usually, labeled, with, lengthy, written, explanations, typically, contain, abstract, geometric, drawings, of, uthras, that, are, reminiscent, of, cubism, or, prehistoric, rock, art, the, art, culture, identity, and, societies, of, the, sikhs, has, been, merged, with, different, locality, and, ethnicity, of, different, sikhs, into, categories, such, as, agrahari, sikhs, dakhni, sikhs, and, assamese, sikhs, however, there, has, emerged, a, niche, cultural, phenomenon, that, can, be, described, as, political, sikh, the, art, of, diaspora, sikhs, such, as, amarjeet, kaur, nandhra, and, amrit, and, rabindra, kaur, singh, the, singh, twins, is, partly, informed, by, their, sikh, spirituality, and, influence, sikhism, was,

piety, and, simplicity, a, transformation, can, be, noticed, with, the, sixth, guru, when, elements, of, political, resistance, and, power, are, added, showing, sikh, political, struggles, at, the, time, further, with, guru, gobind, singh, elements, of, grandeur, were, added, such, as, royal, attire, precious, jewels, elegant, shoes, a, grand, turban, and, a, warrior, like, sword, the, gurus,
