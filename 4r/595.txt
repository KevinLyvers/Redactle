a, silent, film, is, a, film, without, synchronized, recorded, sound, or, more, generally, no, audible, dialogue, though, silent, films, convey, narrative, and, emotion, visually, various, plot, elements, such, as, a, setting, or, era, or, key, lines, of, dialogue, may, when, necessary, be, conveyed, by, the, use, of, inter, title, cards, the, term, silent, film, is, something, of, a, misnomer, as, these, films, were, almost, always, accompanied, by, live, sounds, during, the, silent, era, that, existed, from, the, mid, 1890s, to, the, late, 1920s, a, pianist, theater, organist, or, even, in, larger, cities, an, orchestra, would, play, music, to, accompany, the, films, pianists, and, organists, would, play, either, from, sheet, music, or, improvisation, sometimes, a, person, would, even, narrate, the, inter, title, cards, for, the, audience, though, at, the, time, the, technology, to, synchronize, sound, with, the, film, did, not, exist, music, was, seen, as, an, essential, part, of, the, viewing, experience, silent, film, is, typically, used, as, a, historical, term, to, describe, an, era, of, cinema, prior, to, the, invention, of, synchronized, sound, but, it, also, applies, to, such, sound, era, films, as, city, lights, modern, times, and, silent, movie, which, are, accompanied, by, a, music, only, soundtrack, in, place, of, dialogue, the, term, silent, film, is, a, retronym, a, term, created, to, retroactively, distinguish, something, from, later, developments, early, sound, films, starting, with, the, jazz, singer, in, 1927, were, variously, referred, to, as, the, talkies, sound, films, or, talking, pictures, the, idea, of, combining, motion, pictures, with, recorded, sound, is, older, than, film, it, was, suggested, almost, immediately, after, edison, introduced, the, phonograph, in, 1877, and, some, early, experiments, had, the, projectionist, manually, adjusting, the, frame, rate, to, fit, the, sound, but, because, of, the, technical, challenges, involved, the, introduction, of, synchronized, dialogue, became, practical, only, in, the, late, 1920s, with, the, perfection, of, the, audion, amplifier, tube, and, the, advent, of, the, vitaphone, system, within, a, decade, the, widespread, production, of, silent, films, for, popular, entertainment, had, ceased, and, the, industry, had, moved, fully, into, the, sound, era, in, which, movies, were, accompanied, by, synchronized, sound, recordings, of, spoken, dialogue, music, and, sound, effects, most, early, motion, pictures, are, considered, lost, owing, to, their, physical, decay, for, the, nitrate, filmstock, used, in, that, era, was, extremely, unstable, and, flammable, additionally, many, films, were, deliberately, destroyed, because, they, had, negligible, remaining, immediate, financial, value, in, that, era, it, has, often, been, claimed, that, around, 75, percent, of, silent, films, produced, in, the, us, have, been, lost, though, these, estimates, are, inaccurate, due, to, a, lack, of, numerical, data, film, projection, mostly, evolved, from, magic, lantern, shows, in, which, images, from, handpainted, glass, slides, were, projected, onto, a, wall, or, screen, after, the, advent, of, photography, in, the, 19th, century, still, photographs, were, sometimes, used, narration, of, the, showman, was, important, in, spectacular, entertainment, screenings, and, vital, in, the, lecturing, circuit, the, principle, of, stroboscopic, animation, was, well, known, since, the, introduction, of, the, phenakistiscope, in, 1833, a, popular, optical, toy, but, the, development, of, cinematography, was, hampered, by, long, exposure, times, for, photographic, emulsions, until, eadweard, muybridge, managed, to, record, a, chronophotographic, sequence, in, 1878, after, others, had, animated, his, pictures, in, zoetropes, muybridge, started, lecturing, with, his, own, zoopraxiscope, animation, projector, in, 1880, the, work, of, other, pioneering, chronophotographers, including, tienne, jules, marey, and, ottomar, ansch, tz, furthered, the, development, of, motion, picture, cameras, projectors, and, transparent, celluloid, film, although, thomas, edison, was, keen, to, develop, a, film, system, that, would, be, synchronised, with, his, phonograph, he, eventually, introduced, the, kinetoscope, as, a, silent, motion, picture, viewer, in, 1893, and, later, kinetophone, versions, remained, unsuccessful, the, art, of, motion, pictures, grew, into, full, maturity, in, the, silent, era, 1894, in, film, 1929, in, film, the, height, of, the, silent, era, from, the, early, 1910s, in, film, to, the, late, 1920s, was, a, particularly, fruitful, period, full, of, artistic, innovation, the, film, movements, of, classical, hollywood, as, well, as, french, impressionism, german, expressionism, and, soviet, montage, began, in, this, period, silent, filmmakers, pioneered, the, art, form, to, the, extent, that, virtually, every, style, and, genre, of, film, making, of, the, 20th, and, 21st, centuries, has, its, artistic, roots, in, the, silent, era, the, silent, era, was, also, a, pioneering, one, from, a, technical, point, of, view, three, point, lighting, the, close, up, long, shot, panning, and, continuity, editing, all, became, prevalent, long, before, silent, films, were, replaced, by, talking, pictures, or, talkies, in, the, late, 1920s, some, scholars, claim, that, the, artistic, quality, of, cinema, decreased, for, several, years, during, the, early, 1930s, until, film, directors, actors, and, production, staff, adapted, fully, to, the, new, talkies, around, the, mid, 1930s, the, visual, quality, of, silent, movies, especially, those, produced, in, the, 1920s, was, often, high, but, there, remains, a, widely, held, misconception, that, these, films, were, primitive, or, are, barely, watchable, by, modern, standards, this, misconception, comes, from, the, general, public, s, unfamiliarity, with, the, medium, as, well, as, from, carelessness, on, the, part, of, the, industry, most, silent, films, are, poorly, preserved, leading, to, their, deterioration, and, well, preserved, films, are, often, played, back, at, the, wrong, speed, or, suffer, from, censorship, cuts, and, missing, frames, and, scenes, giving, the, appearance, of, poor, editing, many, silent, films, exist, only, in, second, or, third, generation, copies, often, made, from, already, damaged, and, neglected, film, stock, many, early, screening, were, plagued, by, flicker, on, the, screen, when, the, stroboscopic, interruptions, between, frames, lay, below, the, critical, flicker, frequency, this, was, solved, with, the, introduction, of, a, three, bladed, shutter, since, 1902, causing, two, more, interruptions, per, frame, another, widely, held, misconception, is, that, silent, films, lacked, color, in, fact, color, was, far, more, prevalent, in, silent, films, than, in, the, first, few, decades, of, sound, films, by, the, early, 1920s, 80, percent, of, movies, could, be, seen, in, some, sort, of, color, usually, in, the, form, of, film, tinting, or, toning, or, even, hand, coloring, but, also, with, fairly, natural, two, color, processes, such, as, kinemacolor, and, technicolor, traditional, colorization, processes, ceased, with, the, adoption, of, sound, on, film, technology, traditional, film, colorization, all, of, which, involved, the, use, of, dyes, in, some, form, interfered, with, the, high, resolution, required, for, built, in, recorded, sound, and, were, therefore, abandoned, the, innovative, three, strip, technicolor, process, introduced, in, the, mid, 1930s, was, costly, and, fraught, with, limitations, and, color, would, not, have, the, same, prevalence, in, film, as, it, did, in, the, silents, for, nearly, four, decades, as, motion, pictures, gradually, increased, in, running, time, a, replacement, was, needed, for, the, in, house, interpreter, who, would, explain, parts, of, the, film, to, the, audience, because, silent, films, had, no, synchronized, sound, for, dialogue, onscreen, inter, titles, were, used, to, narrate, story, points, present, key, dialogue, and, sometimes, even, comment, on, the, action, for, the, audience, the, title, writer, became, a, key, professional, in, silent, film, and, was, often, separate, from, the, scenario, writer, who, created, the, story, inter, titles, or, titles, as, they, were, generally, called, at, the, time, often, were, graphic, elements, themselves, featuring, illustrations, or, abstract, decorations, that, commented, on, the, action, showings, of, silent, films, almost, always, featured, live, music, starting, with, the, first, public, projection, of, movies, by, the, lumi, re, brothers, on, december, 28, 1895, in, paris, this, was, furthered, in, 1896, by, the, first, motion, picture, exhibition, in, the, united, states, at, koster, and, bial, s, music, hall, in, new, york, city, at, this, event, edison, set, the, precedent, that, all, exhibitions, should, be, accompanied, by, an, orchestra, from, the, beginning, music, was, recognized, as, essential, contributing, atmosphere, and, giving, the, audience, vital, emotional, cues, musicians, sometimes, played, on, film, sets, during, shooting, for, similar, reasons, however, depending, on, the, size, of, the, exhibition, site, musical, accompaniment, could, drastically, change, in, scale, small, town, and, neighborhood, movie, theatres, usually, had, a, pianist, beginning, in, the, mid, 1910s, large, city, theaters, tended, to, have, organists, or, ensembles, of, musicians, massive, theatre, organs, which, were, designed, to, fill, a, gap, between, a, simple, piano, soloist, and, a, larger, orchestra, had, a, wide, range, of, special, effects, theatrical, organs, such, as, the, famous, mighty, wurlitzer, could, simulate, some, orchestral, sounds, along, with, a, number, of, percussion, effects, such, as, bass, drums, and, cymbals, and, sound, effects, ranging, from, train, and, boat, whistles, car, horns, and, bird, whistles, some, could, even, simulate, pistol, shots, ringing, phones, the, sound, of, surf, horses, hooves, smashing, pottery, thunder, and, rain, musical, scores, for, early, silent, films, were, either, improvised, or, compiled, of, classical, or, theatrical, repertory, music, once, full, features, became, commonplace, however, music, was, compiled, from, photoplay, music, by, the, pianist, organist, orchestra, conductor, or, the, movie, studio, itself, which, included, a, cue, sheet, with, the, film, these, sheets, were, often, lengthy, with, detailed, notes, about, effects, and, moods, to, watch, for, starting, with, the, mostly, original, score, composed, by, joseph, carl, breil, for, d, w, griffith, s, epic, the, birth, of, a, nation, 1915, it, became, relatively, common, for, the, biggest, budgeted, films, to, arrive, at, the, exhibiting, theater, with, original, specially, composed, scores, however, the, first, designated, full, blown, scores, had, in, fact, been, composed, in, 1908, by, camille, saint, sa, ns, for, the, assassination, of, the, duke, of, guise, and, by, mikhail, ippolitov, ivanov, for, stenka, razin, when, organists, or, pianists, used, sheet, music, they, still, might, add, improvisational, flourishes, to, heighten, the, drama, on, screen, even, when, special, effects, were, not, indicated, in, the, score, if, an, organist, was, playing, a, theater, organ, capable, of, an, unusual, sound, effect, such, as, galloping, horses, it, would, be, used, during, scenes, of, dramatic, horseback, chases, at, the, height, of, the, silent, era, movies, were, the, single, largest, source, of, employment, for, instrumental, musicians, at, least, in, the, united, states, however, the, introduction, of, talkies, coupled, with, the, roughly, simultaneous, onset, of, the, great, depression, was, devastating, to, many, musicians, a, number, of, countries, devised, other, ways, of, bringing, sound, to, silent, films, the, early, cinema, of, brazil, for, example, featured, fitas, cantatas, singing, films, filmed, operettas, with, singers, performing, behind, the, screen, in, japan, films, had, not, only, live, music, but, also, the, benshi, a, live, narrator, who, provided, commentary, and, character, voices, the, benshi, became, a, central, element, in, japanese, film, as, well, as, providing, translation, for, foreign, mostly, american, movies, the, popularity, of, the, benshi, was, one, reason, why, silent, films, persisted, well, into, the, 1930s, in, japan, conversely, as, benshi, narrated, films, often, lacked, intertitles, modern, day, audiences, may, sometimes, find, it, difficult, to, follow, the, plots, without, specialised, subtitling, or, additional, commentary, few, film, scores, survived, intact, from, the, silent, period, and, musicologists, are, still, confronted, by, questions, when, they, attempt, to, precisely, reconstruct, those, that, remain, scores, used, in, current, reissues, or, screenings, of, silent, films, may, be, complete, reconstructions, of, compositions, newly, composed, for, the, occasion, assembled, from, already, existing, music, libraries, or, improvised, on, the, spot, in, the, manner, of, the, silent, era, theater, musician, interest, in, the, scoring, of, silent, films, fell, somewhat, out, of, fashion, during, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, there, was, a, belief, in, many, college, film, programs, and, repertory, cinemas, that, audiences, should, experience, silent, film, as, a, pure, visual, medium, undistracted, by, music, this, belief, may, have, been, encouraged, by, the, poor, quality, of, the, music, tracks, found, on, many, silent, film, reprints, of, the, time, since, around, 1980, there, has, been, a, revival, of, interest, in, presenting, silent, films, with, quality, musical, scores, either, reworkings, of, period, scores, or, cue, sheets, or, the, composition, of, appropriate, original, scores, an, early, effort, of, this, kind, was, kevin, brownlow, s, 1980, restoration, of, abel, gance, s, napol, on, 1927, featuring, a, score, by, carl, davis, a, slightly, re, edited, and, sped, up, version, of, brownlow, s, restoration, was, later, distributed, in, the, united, states, by, francis, ford, coppola, with, a, live, orchestral, score, composed, by, his, father, carmine, coppola, in, 1984, an, edited, restoration, of, metropolis, 1927, was, released, with, a, new, rock, music, score, by, producer, composer, giorgio, moroder, although, the, contemporary, score, which, included, pop, songs, by, freddie, mercury, pat, benatar, and, jon, anderson, of, yes, was, controversial, the, door, had, been, opened, for, a, new, approach, to, the, presentation, of, classic, silent, films, today, a, large, number, of, soloists, music, ensembles, and, orchestras, perform, traditional, and, contemporary, scores, for, silent, films, internationally, the, legendary, theater, organist, gaylord, carter, continued, to, perform, and, record, his, original, silent, film, scores, until, shortly, before, his, death, in, 2000, some, of, those, scores, are, available, on, dvd, reissues, other, purveyors, of, the, traditional, approach, include, organists, such, as, dennis, james, and, pianists, such, as, neil, brand, g, nter, buchwald, philip, c, carli, ben, model, and, william, p, perry, other, contemporary, pianists, such, as, stephen, horne, and, gabriel, thibaudeau, have, often, taken, a, more, modern, approach, to, scoring, orchestral, conductors, such, as, carl, davis, and, robert, israel, have, written, and, compiled, scores, for, numerous, silent, films, many, of, these, have, been, featured, in, showings, on, turner, classic, movies, or, have, been, released, on, dvd, davis, has, composed, new, scores, for, classic, silent, dramas, such, as, the, big, parade, 1925, and, flesh, and, the, devil, 1927, israel, has, worked, mainly, in, silent, comedy, scoring, the, films, of, harold, lloyd, buster, keaton, charley, chase, and, others, timothy, brock, has, restored, many, of, charlie, chaplin, s, scores, in, addition, to, composing, new, scores, contemporary, music, ensembles, are, helping, to, introduce, classic, silent, films, to, a, wider, audience, through, a, broad, range, of, musical, styles, and, approaches, some, performers, create, new, compositions, using, traditional, musical, instruments, while, others, add, electronic, sounds, modern, harmonies, rhythms, improvisation, and, sound, design, elements, to, enhance, the, viewing, experience, among, the, contemporary, ensembles, in, this, category, are, un, drame, musical, instantan, alloy, orchestra, club, foot, orchestra, silent, orchestra, mont, alto, motion, picture, orchestra, minima, and, the, caspervek, trio, rpm, orchestra, donald, sosin, and, his, wife, joanna, seaton, specialize, in, adding, vocals, to, silent, films, particularly, where, there, is, onscreen, singing, that, benefits, from, hearing, the, actual, song, being, performed, films, in, this, category, include, griffith, s, lady, of, the, pavements, with, lupe, v, lez, edwin, carewe, s, evangeline, with, dolores, del, r, o, and, rupert, julian, s, the, phantom, of, the, opera, with, mary, philbin, and, virginia, pearson, the, silent, film, sound, and, music, archive, digitizes, music, and, cue, sheets, written, for, silent, films, and, makes, them, available, for, use, by, performers, scholars, and, enthusiasts, silent, film, actors, emphasized, body, language, and, facial, expression, so, that, the, audience, could, better, understand, what, an, actor, was, feeling, and, portraying, on, screen, much, silent, film, acting, is, apt, to, strike, modern, day, audiences, as, simplistic, or, campy, the, melodramatic, acting, style, was, in, some, cases, a, habit, actors, transferred, from, their, former, stage, experience, vaudeville, was, an, especially, popular, origin, for, many, american, silent, film, actors, the, pervading, presence, of, stage, actors, in, film, was, the, cause, of, this, outburst, from, director, marshall, neilan, in, 1917, the, sooner, the, stage, people, who, have, come, into, pictures, get, out, the, better, for, the, pictures, in, other, cases, directors, such, as, john, griffith, wray, required, their, actors, to, deliver, larger, than, life, expressions, for, emphasis, as, early, as, 1914, american, viewers, had, begun, to, make, known, their, preference, for, greater, naturalness, on, screen, silent, films, became, less, vaudevillian, in, the, mid, 1910s, as, the, differences, between, stage, and, screen, became, apparent, due, to, the, work, of, directors, such, as, d, w, griffith, cinematography, became, less, stage, like, and, the, development, of, the, close, up, allowed, for, understated, and, realistic, acting, lillian, gish, has, been, called, film, s, first, true, actress, for, her, work, in, the, period, as, she, pioneered, new, film, performing, techniques, recognizing, the, crucial, differences, between, stage, and, screen, acting, directors, such, as, albert, capellani, and, maurice, tourneur, began, to, insist, on, naturalism, in, their, films, by, the, mid, 1920s, many, american, silent, films, had, adopted, a, more, naturalistic, acting, style, though, not, all, actors, and, directors, accepted, naturalistic, low, key, acting, straight, away, as, late, as, 1927, films, featuring, expressionistic, acting, styles, such, as, metropolis, were, still, being, released, greta, garbo, whose, first, american, film, was, released, in, 1926, would, become, known, for, her, naturalistic, acting, according, to, anton, kaes, a, silent, film, scholar, from, the, university, of, california, berkeley, american, silent, cinema, began, to, see, a, shift, in, acting, techniques, between, 1913, and, 1921, influenced, by, techniques, found, in, german, silent, film, this, is, mainly, attributed, to, the, influx, of, emigrants, from, the, weimar, republic, including, film, directors, producers, cameramen, lighting, and, stage, technicians, as, well, as, actors, and, actresses, until, the, standardization, of, the, projection, speed, of, 24, frames, per, second, fps, for, sound, films, between, 1926, and, 1930, silent, films, were, shot, at, variable, speeds, or, frame, rates, anywhere, from, 12, to, 40, fps, depending, on, the, year, and, studio, standard, silent, film, speed, is, often, said, to, be, 16, fps, as, a, result, of, the, lumi, re, brothers, cin, matographe, but, industry, practice, varied, considerably, there, was, no, actual, standard, william, kennedy, laury, dickson, an, edison, employee, settled, on, the, astonishingly, fast, 40, frames, per, second, additionally, cameramen, of, the, era, insisted, that, their, cranking, technique, was, exactly, 16, fps, but, modern, examination, of, the, films, shows, this, to, be, in, error, and, that, they, often, cranked, faster, unless, carefully, shown, at, their, intended, speeds, silent, films, can, appear, unnaturally, fast, or, slow, however, some, scenes, were, intentionally, undercranked, during, shooting, to, accelerate, the, action, particularly, for, comedies, and, action, films, slow, projection, of, a, cellulose, nitrate, base, film, carried, a, risk, of, fire, as, each, frame, was, exposed, for, a, longer, time, to, the, intense, heat, of, the, projection, lamp, but, there, were, other, reasons, to, project, a, film, at, a, greater, pace, often, projectionists, received, general, instructions, from, the, distributors, on, the, musical, director, s, cue, sheet, as, to, how, fast, particular, reels, or, scenes, should, be, projected, in, rare, instances, usually, for, larger, productions, cue, sheets, produced, specifically, for, the, projectionist, provided, a, detailed, guide, to, presenting, the, film, theaters, also, to, maximize, profit, sometimes, varied, projection, speeds, depending, on, the, time, of, day, or, popularity, of, a, film, or, to, fit, a, film, into, a, prescribed, time, slot, all, motion, picture, film, projectors, require, a, moving, shutter, to, block, the, light, whilst, the, film, is, moving, otherwise, the, image, is, smeared, in, the, direction, of, the, movement, however, this, shutter, causes, the, image, to, flicker, and, images, with, low, rates, of, flicker, are, very, unpleasant, to, watch, early, studies, by, thomas, edison, for, his, kinetoscope, machine, determined, that, any, rate, below, 46, images, per, second, will, strain, the, eye, and, this, holds, true, for, projected, images, under, normal, cinema, conditions, also, the, solution, adopted, for, the, kinetoscope, was, to, run, the, film, at, over, 40, frames, sec, but, this, was, expensive, for, film, however, by, using, projectors, with, dual, and, triple, blade, shutters, the, flicker, rate, is, multiplied, two, or, three, times, higher, than, the, number, of, film, frames, each, frame, being, flashed, two, or, three, times, on, screen, a, three, blade, shutter, projecting, a, 16, fps, film, will, slightly, surpass, edison, s, figure, giving, the, audience, 48, images, per, second, during, the, silent, era, projectors, were, commonly, fitted, with, 3, bladed, shutters, since, the, introduction, of, sound, with, its, 24, frame, sec, standard, speed, 2, bladed, shutters, have, become, the, norm, for, 35, mm, cinema, projectors, though, three, bladed, shutters, have, remained, standard, on, 16, mm, and, 8, mm, projectors, which, are, frequently, used, to, project, amateur, footage, shot, at, 16, or, 18, frames, sec, a, 35, mm, film, frame, rate, of, 24, fps, translates, to, a, film, speed, of, 456, millimetres, 18, 0, in, per, second, one, 1, 000, foot, 300, m, reel, requires, 11, minutes, and, 7, seconds, to, be, projected, at, 24, fps, while, a, 16, fps, projection, of, the, same, reel, would, take, 16, minutes, and, 40, seconds, or, 304, millimetres, 12, 0, in, per, second, in, the, 1950s, many, telecine, conversions, of, silent, films, at, grossly, incorrect, frame, rates, for, broadcast, television, may, have, alienated, viewers, film, speed, is, often, a, vexed, issue, among, scholars, and, film, buffs, in, the, presentation, of, silents, today, especially, when, it, comes, to, dvd, releases, of, restored, films, such, as, the, case, of, the, 2002, restoration, of, metropolis, with, the, lack, of, natural, color, processing, available, films, of, the, silent, era, were, frequently, dipped, in, dyestuffs, and, dyed, various, shades, and, hues, to, signal, a, mood, or, represent, a, time, of, day, hand, tinting, dates, back, to, 1895, in, the, united, states, with, edison, s, release, of, selected, hand, tinted, prints, of, butterfly, dance, additionally, experiments, in, color, film, started, as, early, as, in, 1909, although, it, took, a, much, longer, time, for, color, to, be, adopted, by, the, industry, and, an, effective, process, to, be, developed, blue, represented, night, scenes, yellow, or, amber, meant, day, red, represented, fire, and, green, represented, a, mysterious, atmosphere, similarly, toning, of, film, such, as, the, common, silent, film, generalization, of, sepia, toning, with, special, solutions, replaced, the, silver, particles, in, the, film, stock, with, salts, or, dyes, of, various, colors, a, combination, of, tinting, and, toning, could, be, used, as, an, effect, that, could, be, striking, some, films, were, hand, tinted, such, as, annabelle, serpentine, dance, 1894, from, edison, studios, in, it, annabelle, whitford, a, young, dancer, from, broadway, is, dressed, in, white, veils, that, appear, to, change, colors, as, she, dances, this, technique, was, designed, to, capture, the,
