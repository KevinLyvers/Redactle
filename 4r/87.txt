fiction, is, any, creative, work, chiefly, any, narrative, work, portraying, individuals, events, or, places, that, are, imaginary, or, in, ways, that, are, imaginary, fictional, portrayals, are, thus, inconsistent, with, history, fact, or, plausibility, in, a, traditional, narrow, sense, fiction, refers, to, written, narratives, in, prose, often, referring, specifically, to, novels, novellas, and, short, stories, more, broadly, however, fiction, encompasses, imaginary, narratives, expressed, in, any, medium, including, not, just, writings, but, also, live, theatrical, performances, films, television, programs, radio, dramas, comics, role, playing, games, and, video, games, typically, the, fictionality, of, a, work, is, publicly, expressed, so, the, audience, expects, the, work, to, deviate, to, a, greater, or, lesser, degree, from, the, real, world, rather, than, presenting, for, instance, only, factually, accurate, portrayals, or, characters, who, are, actual, people, because, fiction, is, generally, understood, as, not, adhering, to, the, real, world, the, themes, and, context, of, a, work, such, as, if, and, how, it, relates, to, real, world, issues, or, events, are, open, to, interpretation, since, fiction, is, most, long, established, in, the, realm, of, literature, written, narrative, fiction, the, broad, study, of, the, nature, function, and, meaning, of, fiction, is, called, literary, theory, and, the, narrower, interpretation, of, specific, fictional, texts, is, called, literary, criticism, with, subsets, like, film, criticism, and, theatre, criticism, also, now, long, established, aside, from, real, world, connections, some, fictional, works, may, depict, characters, and, events, within, their, own, context, entirely, separate, from, the, known, physical, universe, an, independent, fictional, universe, the, creative, art, of, constructing, such, an, imaginary, world, is, known, as, worldbuilding, literary, critic, james, wood, argues, that, fiction, is, both, artifice, and, verisimilitude, meaning, that, it, requires, both, creative, inventions, as, well, as, some, acceptable, degree, of, believability, among, its, audience, a, notion, often, encapsulated, in, the, poet, samuel, taylor, coleridge, s, idea, of, the, audience, s, willing, suspension, of, disbelief, the, effects, of, experiencing, fiction, and, the, way, the, audience, is, changed, by, the, new, information, they, discover, has, been, studied, for, centuries, also, infinite, fictional, possibilities, themselves, signal, the, impossibility, of, fully, knowing, reality, provocatively, demonstrating, philosophical, notions, such, as, there, potentially, being, no, criterion, to, measure, constructs, of, reality, in, contrast, to, fiction, creators, of, non, fiction, assume, responsibility, for, presenting, information, and, sometimes, opinion, based, only, in, historical, and, factual, reality, despite, the, traditional, view, that, fiction, and, non, fiction, are, opposites, some, works, particularly, in, the, modern, era, blur, this, boundary, particularly, works, that, fall, under, certain, experimental, storytelling, genres, including, some, postmodern, fiction, autofiction, or, creative, nonfiction, like, non, fiction, novels, and, docudramas, as, well, as, the, deliberate, literary, fraud, of, falsely, marketing, fiction, as, nonfiction, furthermore, even, most, works, of, fiction, usually, have, elements, of, or, grounding, in, truth, of, some, kind, or, truth, from, a, certain, point, of, view, the, distinction, between, the, two, may, be, best, defined, from, the, viewpoint, of, the, audience, according, to, whom, a, work, is, non, fiction, if, its, people, settings, and, plot, are, perceived, entirely, as, historically, or, factually, real, while, a, work, is, regarded, as, fiction, if, it, deviates, from, reality, in, any, of, those, areas, the, distinction, is, further, obscured, by, a, philosophical, understanding, on, the, one, hand, that, the, truth, can, be, presented, through, imaginary, channels, and, constructions, while, on, the, other, hand, works, of, the, imagination, can, just, as, well, bring, about, significant, new, perspectives, on, or, conclusions, about, truth, and, reality, all, types, of, fiction, invite, their, audience, to, explore, real, ideas, issues, or, possibilities, using, an, otherwise, imaginary, setting, or, using, something, similar, to, reality, though, still, distinct, from, it, the, umbrella, genre, of, speculative, fiction, is, characterized, by, a, lesser, degree, of, adherence, to, realistic, or, plausible, individuals, events, or, places, while, the, umbrella, genre, of, realistic, fiction, is, characterized, by, a, greater, degree, for, instance, speculative, fiction, may, depict, an, entirely, imaginary, universe, or, one, in, which, the, laws, of, nature, do, not, strictly, apply, often, the, sub, genre, of, fantasy, or, it, depicts, true, historical, moments, except, that, they, have, concluded, in, a, completely, imaginary, way, or, been, followed, by, major, new, events, that, are, completely, imaginary, the, genre, of, alternative, history, or, it, depicts, impossible, technology, or, technology, that, defies, current, scientific, understandings, or, capabilities, the, genre, of, science, fiction, contrarily, realistic, fiction, involves, a, story, whose, basic, setting, time, and, location, in, the, world, is, in, fact, real, and, whose, events, could, believably, happen, in, the, context, of, the, real, world, one, realistic, fiction, sub, genre, is, historical, fiction, centered, around, true, major, events, and, time, periods, in, the, past, the, attempt, to, make, stories, feel, faithful, to, reality, or, to, more, objectively, describe, details, and, the, 19th, century, artistic, movement, that, began, to, vigorously, promote, this, approach, is, called, literary, realism, which, incorporates, some, works, of, both, fiction, and, non, fiction, storytelling, has, existed, in, all, human, cultures, and, each, culture, incorporates, different, elements, of, truth, and, fiction, into, storytelling, early, fiction, was, closely, associated, with, history, and, myth, greek, poets, such, as, homer, hesiod, and, aesop, developed, fictional, stories, that, were, told, first, through, oral, storytelling, and, then, in, writing, prose, fiction, was, developed, in, ancient, greece, influenced, by, the, storytelling, traditions, of, asia, and, egypt, distinctly, fictional, work, was, not, recognized, as, separate, from, historical, or, mythological, stories, until, the, imperial, period, plasmatic, narrative, following, entirely, invented, characters, and, events, was, developed, through, ancient, drama, and, new, comedy, one, common, structure, among, early, fiction, is, a, series, of, strange, and, fantastic, adventures, as, early, writers, test, the, limits, of, fiction, writing, milesian, tales, were, an, early, example, of, fiction, writing, in, ancient, greece, and, italy, as, fiction, writing, developed, in, ancient, greece, relatable, characters, and, plausible, scenarios, were, emphasized, to, better, connect, with, the, audience, including, elements, such, as, romance, piracy, and, religious, ceremonies, heroic, romance, was, developed, in, medieval, europe, incorporating, elements, associated, with, fantasy, including, supernatural, elements, and, chivalry, the, structure, of, the, modern, novel, was, developed, by,

centuries, including, popular, fiction, magazines, and, early, film, interactive, fiction, was, developed, in, the, late, 20th, century, through, video, games, certain, basic, elements, define, all,

motions, anime, manga, films, video, games, radio, programs, television, programs, comedies, and, dramas, etc, the, internet, has, had, a, major, impact, on, the, creation, and, distribution, of, fiction, calling, into, question, the, feasibility, of, copyright, as, a, means, to, ensure, royalties, are, paid, to, copyright, holders, also, digital, libraries, such, as, project, gutenberg, make, public, domain, texts, more, readily, available, the, combination, of, inexpensive, home, computers, the, internet, and, the, creativity, of, its, users, has, also, led, to, new, forms, of, fiction, such, as, interactive, computer, games, or, computer, generated, comics, countless, forums, for, fan, fiction, can, be, found, online, where, loyal, followers, of, specific, fictional, realms, create, and, distribute, derivative, stories, the, internet, is, also, used, for, the, development, of, blog, fiction, where, a, story, is, delivered, through, a, blog, either, as, flash, fiction, or, serial, blog, and, collaborative, fiction, where, a, story, is, written, sequentially, by, different, authors, or, the, entire, text, can, be, revised, by, anyone, using, a, wiki, the, definition, of, literary, fiction, is, controversial, it, may, refer, to, any, work, of, fiction, in, a, written, form, however, various, other, definitions, exist, including, a, written, work, of, fiction, that, literary, fiction, is, often, used, as, a, synonym, for, literature, in, the, narrow, sense, of, writings, specifically, considered, to, be, an, art, form, while, literary, fiction, is, sometimes, regarded, as, superior, to, genre, fiction, the, two, are, not, mutually, exclusive, and, major, literary, figures, have, employed, the, genres, of, science, fiction, crime, fiction, romance, etc, to, create, works, of, literature, furthermore, the, study, of, genre, fiction, has, developed, within, academia, in, recent, decades, the, term, is, sometimes, used, such, as, to, equate, literary, fiction, to, literature, the, accuracy, of, this, is, debated, neal, stephenson, has, suggested, that, while, any, definition, will, be, simplistic, there, is, today, a, general, cultural, difference, between, literary, and, genre, fiction, on, the, one, hand, literary, authors, nowadays, are, frequently, supported, by, patronage, with, employment, at, a, university, or, a, similar, institution, and, with, the, continuation, of, such, positions, determined, not, by, book, sales, but, by, critical, acclaim, by, other, established, literary, authors, and, critics, on, the, other, hand, he, suggests, genre, fiction, writers, tend, to, support, themselves, by, book, sales, however, in, an, interview, john, updike, lamented, that, the, category, of, literary, fiction, has, sprung, up, recently, to, torment, people, like, me, who, just, set, out, to, write, books, and, if, anybody, wanted, to, read, them, terrific, the, more, the, merrier, i, m, a, genre, writer, of, a, sort, i, write, literary, fiction, which, is, like, spy, fiction, or, chick, lit, likewise, on, the, charlie, rose, show, he, argued, that, this, term, when, applied, to, his, work, greatly, limited, him, and, his, expectations, of, what, might, come, of, his, writing, so, he, does, not, really, like, it, he, suggested, that, all, his, works, are, literary, simply, because, they, are, written, in, words, literary, fiction, often, involves, social, commentary, political, criticism, or, reflection, on, the, human, condition, in, general, it, focuses, on, introspective, in, depth, character, studies, of, interesting, complex, and, developed, characters, this, contrasts, with, genre, fiction, where, plot, is, the, central, concern, usually, in, literary, fiction, the, focus, is, on, the, inner, story, of, the, characters, who, drive, the, plot, with, detailed, motivations, to, elicit, emotional, involvement, in, the, reader, the, style, of, literary, fiction, is, often, described, as, elegantly, written, lyrical, and, layered, the, tone, of, literary, fiction, can, be, darker, than, genre, fiction, while, the, pacing, of, literary, fiction, may, be, slower, than, popular, fiction, as, terrence, rafferty, notes, literary, fiction, by, its, nature, allows, itself, to, dawdle, to, linger, on, stray, beauties, even, at, the, risk, of, losing, its, way, based, on, how, literary, fiction, is, defined, genre, fiction, may, be, a, subset, written, fiction, that, aligns, to, a, particular, genre, or, its, opposite, an, evaluative, label, for, written, fiction, that, comprises, popular, culture, as, artistically, or, intellectually, inferior, to, high, culture, regardless, fiction, is, commonly, broken, down, into, a, variety, of, genres, categories, of, fiction, each, differentiated, by, a, particular, unifying, tone, or, style, set, of, narrative, techniques, archetypes, or, other, tropes, media, content, or, other, popularly, defined, criterion, science, fiction, predicts, or, supposes, technologies, that, are, not, realities, at, the, time, of, the, work, s, creation, jules, verne, s, novel, from, the, earth, to, the, moon, was, published, in, 1865, but, only, in, 1969, did, astronauts, neil, armstrong, and, buzz, aldrin, become, the, first, humans, to, land, on, the, moon, historical, fiction, places, imaginary, characters, into, real, historical, events, in, the, 1814, historical, novel, waverley, sir, walter, scott, s, fictional, character, edward, waverley, meets, a, figure, from, history, bonnie, prince, charlie, and, takes, part, in, the, battle, of, prestonpans, some, works, of, fiction, are, slightly, or, greatly, re, imagined, based, on, some, originally, true, story, or, a, reconstructed, biography, often, even, when, the, fictional, story, is, based, on, fact, there, may, be, additions, and, subtractions, from, the, true, story, to, make, it, more, interesting, an, example, is, tim, o, brien, s, the, things, they, carried, a, 1990, series, of, short, stories, about, the, vietnam, war, fictional, works, that, explicitly, involve, supernatural, magical, or, scientifically, impossible, elements, are, often,

relative, length, and, include, fiction, writing, is, the, process, by, which, an, author, or, creator, produces, a, fictional, work, some, elements, of, the, writing, process, may, be, planned, in, advance, while, others, may, come, about, spontaneously, fiction, writers, use, different, writing, styles, and, have, distinct, writers, voices, when, writing, fictional, stories, the, use, of, real, events, or, real, individuals, as, direct, inspiration, for, imaginary, events, or, imaginary, individuals, is, known, as, fictionalization, the, opposite, circumstance, in, which, the, physical, world, or, a, real, turn, of, events, seem, influenced, by, past, fiction, is, commonly, described, by, the, phrase, life, imitating, art, the, latter, phrase, is, popularity, associated, with, the,
