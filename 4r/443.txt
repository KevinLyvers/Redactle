dance, is, an, art, form, often, classified, as, a, sport, consisting, of, sequences, of, body, movements, with, aesthetic, and, often, symbolic, value, either, improvised, or, purposefully, selected, dance, can, be, categorized, and, described, by, its, choreography, by, its, repertoire, of, movements, or, by, its, historical, period, or, place, of, origin, dance, is, typically, performed, with, musical, accompaniment, and, sometimes, with, the, dancer, simultaneously, using, a, musical, instrument, themselves, an, important, distinction, is, to, be, drawn, between, theatrical, and, participatory, dance, although, these, two, categories, are, not, always, completely, separate, both, may, have, special, functions, whether, social, ceremonial, competitive, erotic, martial, sacred, or, liturgical, other, forms, of, human, movement, are, sometimes, said, to, have, a, dance, like, quality, including, martial, arts, gymnastics, cheerleading, figure, skating, synchronized, swimming, marching, bands, and, many, other, forms, of, athletics, dance, is, not, solely, restricted, to, performance, as, dance, is, used, as, a, form, of, exercise, and, occasionally, training, for, other, sports, and, activities, dance, has, become, a, sport, for, some, with, dancing, competitions, found, across, the, world, exhibiting, various, different, styles, and, standards, dance, has, an, aesthetic, appeal, to, many, people, theatrical, dance, also, called, performance, or, concert, dance, is, intended, primarily, as, a, spectacle, usually, a, performance, upon, a, stage, by, virtuoso, dancers, it, often, tells, a, story, perhaps, using, mime, costume, and, scenery, or, it, may, interpret, the, musical, accompaniment, which, is, often, specially, composed, and, performed, in, a, theatre, setting, but, it, is, not, a, requirement, examples, are, western, ballet, and, modern, dance, classical, indian, dance, such, as, bharatanatyam, and, chinese, and, japanese, song, and, dance, dramas, such, as, the, dragon, dance, most, classical, forms, are, centred, upon, dance, alone, but, performance, dance, may, also, appear, in, opera, and, other, forms, of, musical, theatre, participatory, dance, whether, it, be, a, folk, dance, a, social, dance, a, group, dance, such, as, a, line, circle, chain, or, square, dance, or, a, partner, dance, such, as, in, western, ballroom, dancing, is, undertaken, primarily, for, a, common, purpose, such, as, social, interaction, or, exercise, or, building, flexibility, of, participants, rather, than, to, serve, any, benefit, to, onlookers, such, dance, seldom, has, any, narrative, a, group, dance, and, a, corps, de, ballet, a, social, partner, dance, and, a, pas, de, deux, differ, profoundly, even, a, solo, dance, or, interpretive, dance, may, be, undertaken, solely, for, the, satisfaction, of, the, dancer, participatory, dancers, often, all, employ, the, same, movements, and, steps, but, for, example, in, the, rave, culture, of, electronic, dance, music, vast, crowds, may, engage, in, free, dance, uncoordinated, with, those, around, them, on, the, other, hand, some, cultures, lay, down, strict, rules, as, to, the, particular, dances, people, may, or, must, participate, archaeological, evidence, for, early, dance, includes, 10, 000, years, old, paintings, in, madhya, pradesh, india, at, the, rock, shelters, of, bhimbetka, and, egyptian, tomb, paintings, depicting, dancing, figures, dated, c, 3300, bc, it, has, been, proposed, that, before, the, invention, of, written, languages, dance, was, an, important, part, of, the, oral, and, performance, methods, of, passing, stories, down, from, one, generation, to, the, next, the, use, of, dance, in, ecstatic, trance, states, and, healing, rituals, as, observed, today, in, many, contemporary, indigenous, cultures, is, thought, to, have, been, another, early, factor, in, the, social, development, of, dance, references, to, dance, can, be, found, in, very, early, recorded, history, greek, dance, choros, is, referred, to, by, plato, aristotle, plutarch, and, lucian, the, bible, and, talmud, refer, to, many, events, related, to, dance, and, contain, over, 30, different, dance, terms, in, chinese, pottery, as, early, as, the, neolithic, period, groups, of, people, are, depicted, dancing, in, a, line, holding, hands, and, the, earliest, chinese, word, for, dance, is, found, written, in, the, oracle, bones, dance, is, described, in, the, l, shi, chunqiu, primitive, dance, in, ancient, china, was, associated, with, sorcery, and, shamanic, rituals, during, the, first, millennium, bce, in, india, many, texts, were, composed, which, attempted, to, codify, aspects, of, daily, life, bharata, muni, s, natya, shastra, literally, the, text, of, dramaturgy, is, one, early, text, it, mainly, deals, with, drama, in, which, dance, plays, an, important, part, in, indian, culture, a, strong, continuous, tradition, of, dance, has, since, continued, in, india, through, to, modern, times, where, it, continues, to, play, a, role, in, culture, ritual, and, the, bollywood, entertainment, industry, many, other, contemporary, dance, forms, can, likewise, be, traced, back, to, historical, traditional, ceremonial, and, ethnic, dance, dance, is, generally, but, not, exclusively, performed, with, the, accompaniment, of, music, and, may, or, may, not, be, performed, in, time, to, such, music, some, dance, such, as, tap, dance, or, gumboot, dance, may, provide, its, own, audible, accompaniment, in, place, of, or, in, addition, to, music, many, early, forms, of, music, and, dance, were, created, for, each, other, and, are, frequently, performed, together, notable, examples, of, traditional, dance, music, couplings, include, the, jig, waltz, tango, disco, and, salsa, some, musical, genres, have, a, parallel, dance, form, such, as, baroque, music, and, baroque, dance, other, varieties, of, dance, and, music, may, share, nomenclature, but, developed, separately, such, as, classical, music, and, classical, ballet, the, choreography, and, music, are, meant, to, complement, each, other, to, express, a, story, told, by, the, choreographer, and, dancers, rhythm, and, dance, are, deeply, linked, in, history, and, practice, the, american, dancer, ted, shawn, wrote, the, conception, of, rhythm, which, underlies, all, studies, of, the, dance, is, something, about, which, we, could, talk, forever, and, still, not, finish, a, musical, rhythm, requires, two, main, elements, first, a, regularly, repeating, pulse, also, called, the, beat, or, tactus, that, establishes, the, tempo, and, second, a, pattern, of, accents, and, rests, that, establishes, the, character, of, the, metre, or, basic, rhythmic, pattern, the, basic, pulse, is, roughly, equal, in, duration, to, a, simple, step, or, gesture, dances, generally, have, a, characteristic, tempo, and, rhythmic, pattern, the, tango, for, example, is, usually, danced, in, 2, 4, time, at, approximately, 66, beats, per, minute, the, basic, slow, step, called, a, slow, lasts, for, one, beat, so, that, a, full, right, left, step, is, equal, to, one, 2, 4, measure, the, basic, forward, and, backward, walk, of, the, dance, is, so, counted, slow, slow, while, many, additional, figures, are, counted, slow, quick, quick, repetitive, body, movements, often, depend, on, alternating, strong, and, weak, muscular, movements, given, this, alternation, of, left, right, of, forward, backward, and, rise, fall, along, with, the, bilateral, symmetry, of, the, human, body, many, dances, and, much, music, are, in, duple, and, quadruple, meter, since, some, such, movements, require, more, time, in, one, phase, than, the, other, such, as, the, longer, time, required, to, lift, a, hammer, than, to, strike, some, dance, rhythms, fall, into, triple, metre, occasionally, as, in, the, folk, dances, of, the, balkans, dance, traditions, depend, heavily, on, more, complex, rhythms, further, complex, dances, composed, of, a, fixed, sequence, of, steps, always, require, phrases, and, melodies, of, a, certain, fixed, length, to, accompany, that, sequence, musical, accompaniment, arose, in, the, earliest, dance, so, that, ancient, egyptians, attributed, the, origin, of, the, dance, to, the, divine, athotus, who, was, said, to, have, observed, that, music, accompanying, religious, rituals, caused, participants, to, move, rhythmically, and, to, have, brought, these, movements, into, proportional, measure, the, same, idea, that, dance, arises, from, musical, rhythm, was, found, in, renaissance, europe, in, the, works, of, the, dancer, guglielmo, ebreo, da, pesaro, who, speaks, of, dance, as, a, physical, movement, that, arises, from, and, expresses, inward, spiritual, motion, agreeing, with, the, measures, and, perfect, concords, of, harmony, that, fall, upon, the, human, ear, while, earlier, mechthild, of, magdeburg, seizing, upon, dance, as, a, symbol, of, the, holy, life, foreshadowed, in, jesus, saying, i, have, piped, and, ye, have, not, danced, writes, i, can, not, dance, unless, thou, leadest, if, thou, wouldst, have, me, spring, aloft, sing, thou, and, i, will, spring, into, love, and, from, love, to, knowledge, and, from, knowledge, to, ecstasy, above, all, human, sense, thoinot, arbeau, s, celebrated, 16th, century, dance, treatise, orch, sographie, indeed, begins, with, definitions, of, over, eighty, distinct, drum, rhythms, as, has, been, shown, above, dance, has, been, represented, through, the, ages, as, having, emerged, as, a, response, to, music, yet, as, lincoln, kirstein, implied, it, is, at, least, as, likely, that, primitive, music, arose, from, dance, shawn, concurs, stating, that, dance, was, the, first, art, of, the, human, race, and, the, matrix, out, of, which, all, other, arts, grew, and, that, even, the, metre, in, our, poetry, today, is, a, result, of, the, accents, necessitated, by, body, movement, as, the, dancing, and, reciting, was, performed, simultaneously, an, assertion, somewhat, supported, by, the, common, use, of, the, term, foot, to, describe, the, fundamental, rhythmic, units, of, poetry, scholes, not, a, dancer, but, a, musician, offers, support, for, this, view, stating, that, the, steady, measures, of, music, of, two, three, or, four, beats, to, the, bar, its, equal, and, balanced, phrases, regular, cadences, contrasts, and, repetitions, may, all, be, attributed, to, the, incalculable, influence, of, dance, upon, music, mile, jaques, dalcroze, primarily, a, musician, and, teacher, relates, how, a, study, of, the, physical, movements, of, pianists, led, him, to, the, discovery, that, musical, sensations, of, a, rhythmic, nature, call, for, the, muscular, and, nervous, response, of, the, whole, organism, to, develop, a, special, training, designed, to, regulate, nervous, reactions, and, effect, a, co, ordination, of, muscles, and, nerves, and, ultimately, to, seek, the, connections, between, the, art, of, music, and, the, art, of, dance, which, he, formulated, into, his, system, of, eurhythmics, he, concluded, that, musical, rhythm, is, only, the, transposition, into, sound, of, movements, and, dynamisms, spontaneously, and, involuntarily, expressing, emotion, hence, though, doubtless, as, shawn, asserts, it, is, quite, possible, to, develop, the, dance, without, music, and, music, is, perfectly, capable, of, standing, on, its, own, feet, without, any, assistance, from, the, dance, nevertheless, the, two, arts, will, always, be, related, and, the, relationship, can, be, profitable, both, to, the, dance, and, to, music, the, precedence, of, one, art, over, the, other, being, a, moot, point, the, common, ballad, measures, of, hymns, and, folk, songs, takes, their, name, from, dance, as, does, the, carol, originally, a, circle, dance, many, purely, musical, pieces, have, been, named, waltz, or, minuet, for, example, while, many, concert, dances, have, been, produced, that, are, based, upon, abstract, musical, pieces, such, as, 2, and, 3, part, inventions, adams, violin, concerto, and, andantino, similarly, poems, are, often, structured, and, named, after, dances, or, musical, works, while, dance, and, music, have, both, drawn, their, conception, of, measure, or, metre, from, poetry, shawn, quotes, with, approval, the, statement, of, dalcroze, that, while, the, art, of, musical, rhythm, consists, in, differentiating, and, combining, time, durations, pauses, and, accents, according, to, physiological, law, that, of, plastic, rhythm, i, e, dance, is, to, designate, movement, in, space, to, interpret, long, time, values, by, slow, movements, and, short, ones, by, quick, movements, regulate, pauses, by, their, divers, successions, and, express, sound, accentuations, in, their, multiple, nuances, by, additions, of, bodily, weight, by, means, of, muscular, innervations, shawn, nevertheless, points, out, that, the, system, of, musical, time, is, a, man, made, artificial, thing, a, manufactured, tool, whereas, rhythm, is, something, that, has, always, existed, and, depends, on, man, not, at, all, being, the, continuous, flowing, time, which, our, human, minds, cut, up, into, convenient, units, suggesting, that, music, might, be, revivified, by, a, return, to, the, values, and, the, time, perception, of, dancing, the, early, 20th, century, american, dancer, helen, moller, stated, that, it, is, rhythm, and, form, more, than, harmony, and, color, which, from, the, beginning, has, bound, music, poetry, and, dancing, together, in, a, union, that, is, indissoluble, concert, dance, like, opera, generally, depends, for, its, large, scale, form, upon, a, narrative, dramatic, structure, the, movements, and, gestures, of, the, choreography, are, primarily, intended, to, mime, the, personality, and, aims, of, the, characters, and, their, part, in, the, plot, such, theatrical, requirements, tend, towards, longer, freer, movements, than, those, usual, in, non, narrative, dance, styles, on, the, other, hand, the, ballet, blanc, developed, in, the, 19th, century, allows, interludes, of, rhythmic, dance, that, developed, into, entirely, plotless, ballets, in, the, 20th, century, and, that, allowed, fast, rhythmic, dance, steps, such, as, those, of, the, petit, allegro, a, well, known, example, is, the, cygnets, dance, in, act, two, of, swan, lake, the, ballet, developed, out, of, courtly, dramatic, productions, of, 16th, and, 17th, century, france, and, italy, and, for, some, time, dancers, performed, dances, developed, from, those, familiar, from, the, musical, suite, all, of, which, were, defined, by, definite, rhythms, closely, identified, with, each, dance, these, appeared, as, character, dances, in, the, era, of, romantic, nationalism, ballet, reached, widespread, vogue, in, the, romantic, era, accompanied, by, a, larger, orchestra, and, grander, musical, conceptions, that, did, not, lend, themselves, easily, to, rhythmic, clarity, and, by, dance, that, emphasised, dramatic, mime, a, broader, concept, of, rhythm, was, needed, that, which, rudolf, laban, terms, the, rhythm, and, shape, of, movement, that, communicates, character, emotion, and, intention, while, only, certain, scenes, required, the, exact, synchronisation, of, step, and, music, essential, to, other, dance, styles, so, that, to, laban, modern, europeans, seemed, totally, unable, to, grasp, the, meaning, of, primitive, rhythmic, movements, a, situation, that, began, to, change, in, the, 20th, century, with, such, productions, as, igor, stravinsky, s, the, rite, of, spring, with, its, new, rhythmic, language, evoking, primal, feelings, of, a, primitive, past, indian, classical, dance, styles, like, ballet, are, often, in, dramatic, form, so, that, there, is, a, similar, complementarity, between, narrative, expression, and, pure, dance, in, this, case, the, two, are, separately, defined, though, not, always, separately, performed, the, rhythmic, elements, which, are, abstract, and, technical, are, known, as, nritta, both, this, and, expressive, dance, nritya, though, are, closely, tied, to, the, rhythmic, system, tala, teachers, have, adapted, the, spoken, rhythmic, mnemonic, system, called, bol, to, the, needs, of, dancers, japanese, classical, dance, theatre, styles, such, as, kabuki, and, noh, like, indian, dance, drama, distinguish, between, narrative, and, abstract, dance, productions, the, three, main, categories, of, kabuki, are, jidaimono, historical, sewamono, domestic, and, shosagoto, dance, pieces, somewhat, similarly, noh, distinguishes, between, geki, noh, based, around, the, advancement, of, plot, and, the, narration, of, action, and, fury, noh, dance, pieces, involving, acrobatics, stage, properties, multiple, characters, and, elaborate, stage, action, social, dances, those, intended, for, participation, rather, than, for, an, audience, may, include, various, forms, of, mime, and, narrative, but, are, typically, set, much, more, closely, to, the, rhythmic, pattern, of, music, so, that, terms, like, waltz, and, polka, refer, as, much, to, musical, pieces, as, to, the, dance, itself, the, rhythm, of, the, dancers, feet, may, even, form, an, essential, part, of, the, music, as, in, tap, dance, african, dance, for, example, is, rooted, in, fixed, basic, steps, but, may, also, allow, a, high, degree, of, rhythmic, interpretation, the, feet, or, the, trunk, mark, the, basic, pulse, while, cross, rhythms, are, picked, up, by, shoulders, knees, or, head, with, the, best, dancers, simultaneously, giving, plastic, expression, to, all, the, elements, of, the, polyrhythmic, pattern, dance, in, africa, is, deeply, integrated, into, society, and, major, events, in, a, community, are, frequently, reflected, in, dances, dances, are, performed, for, births, and, funerals, weddings, and, wars, 13, traditional, dances, impart, cultural, morals, including, religious, traditions, and, sexual, standards, give, vent, to, repressed, emotions, such, as, grief, motivate, community, members, to, cooperate, whether, fighting, wars, or, grinding, grain, enact, spiritual, rituals, and, contribute, to, social, cohesiveness, thousands, of, dances, are, performed, around, the, continent, these, may, be, divided, into, traditional, neotraditional, and, classical, styles, folkloric, dances, of, a, particular, society, dances, created, more, recently, in, imitation, of, traditional, styles, and, dances, transmitted, more, formally, in, schools, or, private, lessons, 18, african, dance, has, been, altered, by, many, forces, such, as, european, missionaries, and, colonialist, governments, who, often, suppressed, local, dance, traditions, as, licentious, or, distracting, dance, in, contemporary, african, cultures, still, serves, its, traditional, functions, in, new, contexts, dance, may, celebrate, the, inauguration, of, a, hospital, build, community, for, rural, migrants, in, unfamiliar, cities, and, be, incorporated, into, christian, church, ceremonies, all, indian, classical, dances, are, to, varying, degrees, rooted, in, the, natyashastra, and, therefore, share, common, features, for, example, the, mudra, s, hand, positions, some, body, positions, leg, movement, and, the, inclusion, of, dramatic, or, expressive, acting, or, abhinaya, indian, classical, music, provides, accompaniment, and, dancers, of, nearly, all, the, styles, wear, bells, around, their, ankles, to, counterpoint, and, complement, the, percussion, there, are, now, many, regional, varieties, of, indian, classical, dance, dances, like, odra, magadhi, which, after, decades, long, debate, has, been, traced, to, present, day, mithila, odisha, region, s, dance, form, of, odissi, orissi, indicate, influence, of, dances, in, cultural, interactions, between, different, regions, the, punjab, area, overlapping, india, and, pakistan, is, the, place, of, origin, of, bhangra, it, is, widely, known, both, as, a, style, of, music, and, a, dance, it, is, mostly, related, to, ancient, harvest, celebrations, love, patriotism, or, social, issues, its, music, is, coordinated, by, a, musical, instrument, called, the, dhol, bhangra, is, not, just, music, but, a, dance, a, celebration, of, the, harvest, where, people, beat, the, dhol, drum, sing, boliyaan, lyrics, and, dance, it, developed, further, with, the, vaisakhi, festival, of, the, sikhs, the, dances, of, sri, lanka, include, the, devil, dances, yakun, natima, a, carefully, crafted, ritual, reaching, far, back, into, sri, lanka, s, pre, buddhist, past, that, combines, ancient, ayurvedic, concepts, of, disease, causation, with, psychological, manipulation, and, combines, many, aspects, including, sinhalese, cosmology, their, influence, can, be, seen, on, the, classical, dances, of, sri, lanka, indonesian, dances, reflect, the, richness, and, diversity, of, indonesian, ethnic, groups, and, cultures, there, are, more, than, 1, 300, ethnic, groups, in, indonesia, it, can, be, seen, from, the, cultural, roots, of, the, austronesian, and, melanesian, peoples, and, various, cultural, influences, from, asia, and, the, west, dances, in, indonesia, originate, from, ritual, movements, and, religious, ceremonies, this, kind, of, dance, usually, begins, with, rituals, such, as, war, dances, shaman, dances, to, cure, or, ward, off, disease, dances, to, call, rain, and, other, types, of, dances, with, the, acceptance, of, dharma, religion, in, the, 1st, century, in, indonesia, hinduism, and, buddhist, rituals, were, celebrated, in, various, artistic, performances, hindu, epics, such, as, the, ramayana, mahabharata, and, also, the, panji, became, the, inspiration, to, be, shown, in, a, dance, drama, called, sendratari, resembling, ballet, in, the, western, tradition, an, elaborate, and, highly, stylized, dance, method, was, invented, and, has, survived, to, this, day, especially, on, the, islands, of, java, and, bali, the, javanese, wayang, wong, dance, takes, footage, from, the, ramayana, or, mahabharata, episodes, but, this, dance, is, very, different, from, the, indian, version, indonesian, dances, do, not, pay, as, much, attention, to, the, mudras, as, indian, dances, even, more, to, show, local, forms, the, sacred, javanese, ritual, dance, bedhaya, is, believed, to, date, back, to, the, majapahit, period, in, the, 14th, century, or, even, earlier, this, dance,

assyrian, folk, dance, kurdish, dance, armenian, dance, and, turkish, dance, among, others, all, these, forms, of, dances, would, usually, involve, participants, engaging, each, other, by, holding,
