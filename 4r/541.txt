in, visual, perception, an, optical, illusion, also, called, a, visual, illusion, is, an, illusion, caused, by, the, visual, system, and, characterized, by, a, visual, percept, that, arguably, appears, to, differ, from, reality, illusions, come, in, a, wide, variety, their, categorization, is, difficult, because, the, underlying, cause, is, often, not, clear, but, a, classification, proposed, by, richard, gregory, is, useful, as, an, orientation, according, to, that, there, are, three, main, classes, physical, physiological, and, cognitive, illusions, and, in, each, class, there, are, four, kinds, ambiguities, distortions, paradoxes, and, fictions, a, classical, example, for, a, physical, distortion, would, be, the, apparent, bending, of, a, stick, half, immerged, in, water, an, example, for, a, physiological, paradox, is, the, motion, aftereffect, where, despite, movement, position, remains, unchanged, an, example, for, a, physiological, fiction, is, an, afterimage, three, typical, cognitive, distortions, are, the, ponzo, poggendorff, and, m, ller, lyer, illusion, physical, illusions, are, caused, by, the, physical, environment, e, g, by, the, optical, properties, of, water, physiological, illusions, arise, in, the, eye, or, the, visual, pathway, e, g, from, the, effects, of, excessive, stimulation, of, a, specific, receptor, type, cognitive, visual, illusions, are, the, result, of, unconscious, inferences, and, are, perhaps, those, most, widely, known, pathological, visual, illusions, arise, from, pathological, changes, in, the, physiological, visual, perception, mechanisms, causing, the, aforementioned, types, of, illusions, they, are, discussed, e, g, under, visual, hallucinations, optical, illusions, as, well, as, multi, sensory, illusions, involving, visual, perception, can, also, be, used, in, the, monitoring, and, rehabilitation, of, some, psychological, disorders, including, phantom, limb, syndrome, and, schizophrenia, a, familiar, phenomenon, and, example, for, a, physical, visual, illusion, is, when, mountains, appear, to, be, much, nearer, in, clear, weather, with, low, humidity, foehn, than, they, are, this, is, because, haze, is, a, cue, for, depth, perception, signalling, the, distance, of, far, away, objects, aerial, perspective, the, classical, example, of, a, physical, illusion, is, when, a, stick, that, is, half, immersed, in, water, appears, bent, this, phenomenon, was, discussed, by, ptolemy, c, 150, and, was, often, a, prototypical, example, for, an, illusion, physiological, illusions, such, as, the, afterimages, following, bright, lights, or, adapting, stimuli, of, excessively, longer, alternating, patterns, contingent, perceptual, aftereffect, are, presumed, to, be, the, effects, on, the, eyes, or, brain, of, excessive, stimulation, or, interaction, with, contextual, or, competing, stimuli, of, a, specific, type, brightness, color, position, tile, size, movement, etc, the, theory, is, that, a, stimulus, follows, its, individual, dedicated, neural, path, in, the, early, stages, of, visual, processing, and, that, intense, or, repetitive, activity, in, that, or, interaction, with, active, adjoining, channels, causes, a, physiological, imbalance, that, alters, perception, the, hermann, grid, illusion, and, mach, bands, are, two, illusions, that, are, often, explained, using, a, biological, approach, lateral, inhibition, where, in, receptive, fields, of, the, retina, receptor, signals, from, light, and, dark, areas, compete, with, one, another, has, been, used, to, explain, why, we, see, bands, of, increased, brightness, at, the, edge, of, a, color, difference, when, viewing, mach, bands, once, a, receptor, is, active, it, inhibits, adjacent, receptors, this, inhibition, creates, contrast, highlighting, edges, in, the, hermann, grid, illusion, the, gray, spots, that, appear, at, the, intersections, at, peripheral, locations, are, often, explained, to, occur, because, of, lateral, inhibition, by, the, surround, in, larger, receptive, fields, however, lateral, inhibition, as, an, explanation, of, the, hermann, grid, illusion, has, been, disproved, more, recent, empirical, approaches, to, optical, illusions, have, had, some, success, in, explaining, optical, phenomena, with, which, theories, based, on, lateral, inhibition, have, struggled, cognitive, illusions, are, assumed, to, arise, by, interaction, with, assumptions, about, the, world, leading, to, unconscious, inferences, an, idea, first, suggested, in, the, 19th, century, by, the, german, physicist, and, physician, hermann, helmholtz, cognitive, illusions, are, commonly, divided, into, ambiguous, illusions, distorting, illusions, paradox, illusions, or, fiction, illusions, to, make, sense, of, the, world, it, is, necessary, to, organize, incoming, sensations, into, information, which, is, meaningful, gestalt, psychologists, believe, one, way, this, is, done, is, by, perceiving, individual, sensory, stimuli, as, a, meaningful, whole, gestalt, organization, can, be, used, to, explain, many, illusions, including, the, rabbit, duck, illusion, where, the, image, as, a, whole, switches, back, and, forth, from, being, a, duck, then, being, a, rabbit, and, why, in, the, figure, ground, illusion, the, figure, and, ground, are, reversible, in, addition, gestalt, theory, can, be, used, to, explain, the, illusory, contours, in, the, kanizsa, s, triangle, a, floating, white, triangle, which, does, not, exist, is, seen, the, brain, has, a, need, to, see, familiar, simple, objects, and, has, a, tendency, to, create, a, whole, image, from, individual, elements, gestalt, means, form, or, shape, in, german, however, another, explanation, of, the, kanizsa, s, triangle, is, based, in, evolutionary, psychology, and, the, fact, that, in, order, to, survive, it, was, important, to, see, form, and, edges, the, use, of, perceptual, organization, to, create, meaning, out, of, stimuli, is, the, principle, behind, other, well, known, illusions, including, impossible, objects, the, brain, makes, sense, of, shapes, and, symbols, putting, them, together, like, a, jigsaw, puzzle, formulating, that, which, is, not, there, to, that, which, is, believable, the, gestalt, principles, of, perception, govern, the, way, different, objects, are, grouped, good, form, is, where, the, perceptual, system, tries, to, fill, in, the, blanks, in, order, to, see, simple, objects, rather, than, complex, objects, continuity, is, where, the, perceptual, system, tries, to, disambiguate, which, segments, fit, together, into, continuous, lines, proximity, is, where, objects, that, are, close, together, are, associated, similarity, is, where, objects, that, are, similar, are, seen, as, associated, some, of, these, elements, have, been, successfully, incorporated, into, quantitative, models, involving, optimal, estimation, or, bayesian, inference, the, double, anchoring, theory, a, popular, but, recent, theory, of, lightness, illusions, states, that, any, region, belongs, to, one, or, more, frameworks, created, by, gestalt, grouping, principles, and, within, each, frame, is, independently, anchored, to, both, the, highest, luminance, and, the, surround, luminance, a, spot, s, lightness, is, determined, by, the, average, of, the, values, computed, in, each, framework, illusions, can, be, based, on, an, individual, s, ability, to, see, in, three, dimensions, even, though, the, image, hitting, the, retina, is, only, two, dimensional, the, ponzo, illusion, is, an, example, of, an, illusion, which, uses, monocular, cues, of, depth, perception, to, fool, the, eye, but, even, with, two, dimensional, images, the, brain, exaggerates, vertical, distances, when, compared, with, horizontal, distances, as, in, the, vertical, horizontal, illusion, where, the, two, lines, are, exactly, the, same, length, in, the, ponzo, illusion, the, converging, parallel, lines, tell, the, brain, that, the, image, higher, in, the, visual, field, is, farther, away, therefore, the, brain, perceives, the, image, to, be, larger, although, the, two, images, hitting, the, retina, are, the, same, size, the, optical, illusion, seen, in, a, diorama, false, perspective, also, exploits, assumptions, based, on, monocular, cues, of, depth, perception, the, m, c, escher, painting, waterfall, exploits, rules, of, depth, and, proximity, and, our, understanding, of, the, physical, world, to, create, an, illusion, like, depth, perception, motion, perception, is, responsible, for, a, number, of, sensory, illusions, film, animation, is, based, on, the, illusion, that, the, brain, perceives, a, series, of, slightly, varied, images, produced, in, rapid, succession, as, a, moving, picture, likewise, when, we, are, moving, as, we, would, be, while, riding, in, a, vehicle, stable, surrounding, objects, may, appear, to, move, we, may, also, perceive, a, large, object, like, an, airplane, to, move, more, slowly, than, smaller, objects, like, a, car, although, the, larger, object, is, actually, moving, faster, the, phi, phenomenon, is, yet, another, example, of, how, the, brain, perceives, motion, which, is, most, often, created, by, blinking, lights, in, close, succession, the, ambiguity, of, direction, of, motion, due, to, lack, of, visual, references, for, depth, is, shown, in, the, spinning, dancer, illusion, the, spinning, dancer, appears, to, be, moving, clockwise, or, counterclockwise, depending, on, spontaneous, activity, in, the, brain, where, perception, is, subjective, recent, studies, show, on, the, fmri, that, there, are, spontaneous, fluctuations, in, cortical, activity, while, watching, this, illusion, particularly, the, parietal, lobe, because, it, is, involved, in, perceiving, movement, perceptual, constancies, are, sources, of, illusions, color, constancy, and, brightness, constancy, are, responsible, for, the, fact, that, a, familiar, object, will, appear, the, same, color, regardless, of, the, amount, of, light, or, color, of, light, reflecting, from, it, an, illusion, of, color, difference, or, luminosity, difference, can, be, created, when, the, luminosity, or, color, of, the, area, surrounding, an, unfamiliar, object, is, changed, the, luminosity, of, the, object, will, appear, brighter, against, a, black, field, that, reflects, less, light, than, against, a, white, field, even, though, the, object, itself, did, not, change, in, luminosity, similarly, the, eye, will, compensate, for, color, contrast, depending, on, the, color, cast, of, the, surrounding, area, in, addition, to, the, gestalt, principles, of, perception, water, color, illusions, contribute, to, the, formation, of, optical, illusions, water, color, illusions, consist, of, object, hole, effects, and, coloration, object, hole, effects, occur, when, boundaries, are, prominent, where, there, is, a, figure, and, background, with, a, hole, that, is, 3d, volumetric, in, appearance, coloration, consists, of, an, assimilation, of, color, radiating, from, a, thin, colored, edge, lining, a, darker, chromatic, contour, the, water, color, illusion, describes, how, the, human, mind, perceives, the, wholeness, of, an, object, such, as, top, down, processing, thus, contextual, factors, play, into, perceiving, the, brightness, of, an, object, just, as, it, perceives, color, and, brightness, constancies, the, brain, has, the, ability, to, understand, familiar, objects, as, having, a, consistent, shape, or, size, for, example, a, door, is, perceived, as, a, rectangle, regardless, of, how, the, image, may, change, on, the, retina, as, the, door, is, opened, and, closed, unfamiliar, objects, however, do, not, always, follow, the, rules, of, shape, constancy, and, may, change, when, the, perspective, is, changed, the, shepard, tables, illusion, is, an, example, of, an, illusion, based, on, distortions, in, shape, constancy, researcher, mark, changizi, of, rensselaer, polytechnic, institute, in, new, york, has, a, more, imaginative, take, on, optical, illusions, saying, that, they, are, due, to, a, neural, lag, which, most, humans, experience, while, awake, when, light, hits, the, retina, about, one, tenth, of, a, second, goes, by, before, the, brain, translates, the, signal, into, a, visual, perception, of, the, world, scientists, have, known, of, the, lag, yet, they, have, debated, how, humans, compensate, with, some, proposing, that, our, motor, system, somehow, modifies, our, movements, to, offset, the, delay, changizi, asserts, that, the, human, visual, system, has, evolved, to, compensate, for, neural, delays, by, generating, images, of, what, will, occur, one, tenth, of, a, second, into, the, future, this, foresight, enables, humans, to, react, to, events, in, the, present, enabling, humans, to, perform, reflexive, acts, like, catching, a, fly, ball, and, to, maneuver, smoothly, through, a, crowd, in, an, interview, with, abc, changizi, said, illusions, occur, when, our, brains, attempt, to, perceive, the, future, and, those, perceptions, don, t, match, reality, for, example, an, illusion, called, the, hering, illusion, looks, like, bicycle, spokes, around, a, central, point, with, vertical, lines, on, either, side, of, this, central, so, called, vanishing, point, the, illusion, tricks, us, into, thinking, we, are, looking, at, a, perspective, picture, and, thus, according, to, changizi, switches, on, our, future, seeing, abilities, since, we, are, not, actually, moving, and, the, figure, is, static, we, misperceive, the, straight, lines, as, curved, ones, changizi, said, evolution, has, seen, to, it, that, geometric, drawings, like, this, elicit, in, us, premonitions, of, the, near, future, the, converging, lines, toward, a, vanishing, point, the, spokes, are, cues, that, trick, our, brains, into, thinking, we, are, moving, forward, as, we, would, in, the, real, world, where, the, door, frame, a, pair, of, vertical, lines, seems, to, bow, out, as, we, move, through, it, and, we, try, to, perceive, what, that, world, will, look, like, in, the, next, instant, a, pathological, visual, illusion, is, a, distortion, of, a, real, external, stimulus, and, is, often, diffuse, and, persistent, pathological, visual, illusions, usually, occur, throughout, the, visual, field, suggesting, global, excitability, or, sensitivity, alterations, alternatively, visual, hallucination, is, the, perception, of, an, external, visual, stimulus, where, none, exists, visual, hallucinations, are, often, from, focal, dysfunction, and, are, usually, transient, types, of, visual, illusions, include, oscillopsia, halos, around, objects, illusory, palinopsia, visual, trailing, light, streaking, prolonged, indistinct, afterimages, akinetopsia, visual, snow, micropsia, macropsia, teleopsia, pelopsia, metamorphopsia, dyschromatopsia, intense, glare, blue, field, entoptic, phenomenon, and, purkinje, trees, these, symptoms, may, indicate, an, underlying, disease, state, and, necessitate, seeing, a, medical, practitioner, etiologies, associated, with, pathological, visual, illusions, include, multiple, types, of, ocular, disease, migraines, hallucinogen, persisting, perception, disorder, head, trauma, and, prescription, drugs, if, a, medical, work, up, does, not, reveal, a, cause, of, the, pathological, visual, illusions, the, idiopathic, visual, disturbances, could, be, analogous, to, the, altered, excitability, state, seen, in, visual, aura, with, no, migraine, headache, if, the, visual, illusions, are, diffuse, and, persistent, they, often, affect, the, patient, s, quality, of, life, these, symptoms, are, often, refractory, to, treatment, and, may, be, caused, by, any, of, the, aforementioned, etiologies, but, are, often, idiopathic, there, is, no, standard, treatment, for, these, visual, disturbances, the, rubber, hand, illusion, rhi, a, multi, sensory, illusion, involving, both, visual, perception, and, touch, has, been, used, to, study, how, phantom, limb, syndrome, affects, amputees, over, time, amputees, with, the, syndrome, actually, responded, to, rhi, more, strongly, than, controls, an, effect, that, was, often, consistent, for, both, the, sides, of, the, intact, and, the, amputated, arm, however, in, some, studies, amputees, actually, had, stronger, responses, to, rhi, on, their, intact, arm, and, more, recent, amputees, responded, to, the, illusion, better, than, amputees, who, had, been, missing, an, arm, for, years, or, more, researchers, believe, this, is, a, sign, that, the, body, schema, or, an, individual, s, sense, of, their, own, body, and, its, parts, progressively, adapts, to, the, post, amputation, state, essentially, the, amputees, were, learning, to, no, longer, respond, to, sensations, near, what, had, once, been, their, arm, as, a, result, many, have, suggested, the, use, of, rhi, as, a, tool, for, monitoring, an, amputee, s, progress, in, reducing, their, phantom, limb, sensations, and, adjusting, to, the, new, state, of, their, body, other, research, used, rhi, in, the, rehabilitation, of, amputees, with, prosthetic, limbs, after, prolonged, exposure, to, rhi, the, amputees, gradually, stopped, feeling, a, dissociation, between, the, prosthetic, which, resembled, the, rubber, hand, and, the, rest, of, their, body, this, was, thought, to, be, because, they, adjusted, to, responding, to, and, moving, a, limb, that, did, not, feel, as, connected, to, the, rest, of, their, body, or, senses, rhi, may, also, be, used, to, diagnose, certain, disorders, related, to, impaired, proprioception, or, impaired, sense, of, touch, in, non, amputees, schizophrenia, a, mental, disorder, often, marked, by, hallucinations, also, decreases, a, person, s, ability, to, perceive, high, order, optical, illusions, this, is, because, schizophrenia, impairs, one, s, capacity, to, perform, top, down, processing, and, a, higher, level, integration, of, visual, information, beyond, the, primary, visual, cortex, v1, understanding, how, this, specifically, occurs, in, the, brain, may, help, in, understanding, how, visual, distortions, beyond, imaginary, hallucinations, affect, schizophrenic, patients, additionally, evaluating, the, differences, between, how, schizophrenic, patients, and, unaffected, individuals, see, illusions, may, enable, researchers, to, better, identify, where, specific, illusions, are, processed, in, the, visual, streams, one, study, on, schizophrenic, patients, found, that, they, were, extremely, unlikely, to, be, fooled, by, a, three, dimensional, optical, illusion, the, hollow, face, illusion, unlike, neurotypical, volunteers, based, on, fmri, data, researchers, concluded, that, this, resulted, from, a, disconnection, between, their, systems, for, bottom, up, processing, of, visual, cues, and, top, down, interpretations, of, those, cues, in, the, parietal, cortex, in, another, study, on, the, motion, induced, blindness, mib, illusion, pictured, right, schizophrenic, patients, continued, to, perceive, stationary, visual, targets, even, when, observing, distracting, motion, stimuli, unlike, neurotypical, controls, who, experienced, motion, induced, blindness, the, schizophrenic, test, subjects, demonstrated, impaired, cognitive, organization, meaning, they, were, less, able, to, coordinate, their, processing, of, motion, cues, and, stationary, image, cues, artists, who, have, worked, with, optical, illusions, include, m, c, escher, bridget, riley, salvador, dal, giuseppe, arcimboldo, patrick, bokanowski, marcel, duchamp, jasper, johns, oscar, reutersv, rd, victor, vasarely, and, charles, allan, gilbert, contemporary, artists, who, have, experimented, with, illusions, include, jonty, hurwitz, sandro, del, prete, octavio, ocampo, dick, termes, shigeo, fukuda, patrick, hughes, istv, n, orosz, rob, gonsalves, gianni, a, sarcone, ben, heine, and, akiyoshi, kitaoka, optical, illusion, is, also, used, in, film, by, the, technique, of, forced, perspective, op, art, is, a, style, of, art, that, uses, optical, illusions, to, create, an, impression, of, movement, or, hidden, images, and, patterns, trompe, l, il, uses, realistic, imagery, to, create, the, optical, illusion, that, depicted, objects, exist, in, three, dimensions, tourists, attractions, employing, large, scale, illusory, art, allowing, visitors, to, photograph, themselves, in, fantastic, scenes, have, opened, in, several, asian, countries, such, as, the, trickeye, museum, and, hong, kong, 3d, museum, the, hypothesis, claims, that, visual, illusions, occur, because, the, neural, circuitry, in, our, visual, system, evolves, by, neural, learning, to, a, system, that, makes, very, efficient, interpretations, of, usual, 3d, scenes, based, in, the, emergence, of, simplified, models, in, our, brain, that, speed, up, the, interpretation, process, but, give, rise, to, optical, illusions, in, unusual, situations, in, this, sense, the, cognitive, processes, hypothesis, can, be, considered, a, framework, for, an, understanding, of, optical, illusions, as, the, signature, of, the, empirical, statistical, way, vision, has, evolved, to, solve, the, inverse, problem, research, indicates, that, 3d, vision, capabilities, emerge, and, are, learned, jointly, with, the, planning, of, movements, that, is, as, depth, cues, are, better, perceived, individuals, can, develop, more, efficient, patterns, of, movement, and, interaction, within, the, 3d, environment, around, them, after, a, long, process, of, learning, an, internal, representation, of, the, world, emerges, that, is, well, adjusted, to, the, perceived, data, coming, from, closer, objects, the, representation, of, distant, objects, near, the, horizon, is, less, adequate, in, fact, it, is, not, only, the, moon, that, seems, larger, when, we, perceive, it, near, the, horizon, in, a, photo, of, a, distant, scene, all, distant, objects, are, perceived, as, smaller, than, when, we, observe, them, directly, using, our, vision
