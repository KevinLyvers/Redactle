ancient, greek, architecture, came, from, the, greeks, or, hellenes, whose, culture, flourished, on, the, greek, mainland, the, peloponnese, the, aegean, islands, and, in, colonies, in, anatolia, and, italy, for, a, period, from, about, 900, bc, until, the, 1st, century, ad, with, the, earliest, remaining, architectural, works, dating, from, around, 600, bc, ancient, greek, architecture, is, best, known, for, its, temples, many, of, which, are, found, throughout, the, region, with, the, parthenon, regarded, now, as, in, ancient, times, as, the, prime, example, most, remains, are, very, incomplete, ruins, but, a, number, survive, substantially, intact, mostly, outside, modern, greece, the, second, important, type, of, building, that, survives, all, over, the, hellenic, world, is, the, open, air, theatre, with, the, earliest, dating, from, around, 525, 480, bc, other, architectural, forms, that, are, still, in, evidence, are, the, processional, gateway, propylon, the, public, square, agora, surrounded, by, storied, colonnade, stoa, the, town, council, building, bouleuterion, the, public, monument, the, monumental, tomb, mausoleum, and, the, stadium, ancient, greek, architecture, is, distinguished, by, its, highly, formalised, characteristics, both, of, structure, and, decoration, this, is, particularly, so, in, the, case, of, temples, where, each, building, appears, to, have, been, conceived, as, a, sculptural, entity, within, the, landscape, most, often, raised, on, high, ground, so, that, the, elegance, of, its, proportions, and, the, effects, of, light, on, its, surfaces, might, be, viewed, from, all, angles, nikolaus, pevsner, refers, to, the, plastic, shape, of, the, temple, placed, before, us, with, a, physical, presence, more, intense, more, alive, than, that, of, any, later, building, the, formal, vocabulary, of, ancient, greek, architecture, in, particular, the, division, of, architectural, style, into, three, defined, orders, the, doric, order, the, ionic, order, and, the, corinthian, order, was, to, have, a, profound, effect, on, western, architecture, of, later, periods, the, architecture, of, ancient, rome, grew, out, of, that, of, greece, and, maintained, its, influence, in, italy, unbroken, until, the, present, day, from, the, renaissance, revivals, of, classicism, have, kept, alive, not, only, the, precise, forms, and, ordered, details, of, greek, architecture, but, also, its, concept, of, architectural, beauty, based, on, balance, and, proportion, the, successive, styles, of, neoclassical, architecture, and, greek, revival, architecture, followed, and, adapted, ancient, greek, styles, closely, the, mainland, and, islands, of, greece, are, very, rocky, with, deeply, indented, coastline, and, rugged, mountain, ranges, with, few, substantial, forests, the, most, freely, available, building, material, is, stone, limestone, was, readily, available, and, easily, worked, there, is, an, abundance, of, high, quality, white, marble, both, on, the, mainland, and, islands, particularly, paros, and, naxos, this, finely, grained, material, was, a, major, contributing, factor, to, precision, of, detail, both, architectural, and, sculptural, that, adorned, ancient, greek, architecture, deposits, of, high, quality, potter, s, clay, were, found, throughout, greece, and, the, islands, with, major, deposits, near, athens, it, was, used, not, only, for, pottery, vessels, but, also, roof, tiles, and, architectural, decoration, the, climate, of, greece, is, maritime, with, both, the, coldness, of, winter, and, the, heat, of, summer, tempered, by, sea, breezes, this, led, to, a, lifestyle, where, many, activities, took, place, outdoors, hence, temples, were, placed, on, hilltops, their, exteriors, designed, as, a, visual, focus, of, gatherings, and, processions, while, theatres, were, often, an, enhancement, of, a, naturally, occurring, sloping, site, where, people, could, sit, rather, than, a, containing, structure, colonnades, encircling, buildings, or, surrounding, courtyards, provided, shelter, from, the, sun, and, from, sudden, winter, storms, the, light, of, greece, may, be, another, important, factor, in, the, development, of, the, particular, character, of, ancient, greek, architecture, the, light, is, often, extremely, bright, with, both, the, sky, and, the, sea, vividly, blue, the, clear, light, and, sharp, shadows, give, a, precision, to, the, details, of, the, landscape, pale, rocky, outcrops, and, seashore, this, clarity, is, alternated, with, periods, of, haze, that, varies, in, colour, to, the, light, on, it, in, this, characteristic, environment, the, ancient, greek, architects, constructed, buildings, that, were, marked, by, the, precision, of, detail, the, gleaming, marble, surfaces, were, smooth, curved, fluted, or, ornately, sculpted, to, reflect, the, sun, cast, graded, shadows, and, change, in, colour, with, the, ever, changing, light, of, day, historians, divide, ancient, greek, civilization, into, two, eras, the, hellenic, period, from, around, 900, bc, to, the, death, of, alexander, the, great, in, 323, bc, and, the, hellenistic, period, 323, bc, 30, ad, during, the, earlier, hellenic, period, substantial, works, of, architecture, began, to, appear, around, 600, bc, during, the, later, hellenistic, period, greek, culture, spread, as, a, result, of, alexander, s, conquest, of, other, lands, and, later, as, a, result, of, the, rise, of, the, roman, empire, which, adopted, much, of, greek, culture, before, the, hellenic, era, two, major, cultures, had, dominated, the, region, the, minoan, c, 2800, c, 1100, bc, and, the, mycenaean, c, 1500, 1100, bc, minoan, is, the, name, given, by, modern, historians, to, the, culture, of, the, people, of, ancient, crete, known, for, its, elaborate, and, richly, decorated, minoan, palaces, and, for, its, pottery, the, most, famous, of, which, painted, with, floral, and, motifs, of, sea, life, the, mycenaean, culture, which, flourished, on, the, peloponnesus, was, different, in, character, its, people, built, citadels, fortifications, and, tombs, and, decorated, their, pottery, with, bands, of, marching, soldiers, rather, than, octopus, and, seaweed, both, these, civilizations, came, to, an, end, around, 1100, bc, that, of, crete, possibly, because, of, volcanic, devastation, and, that, of, mycenae, because, of, an, invasion, by, the, dorian, people, who, lived, on, the, greek, mainland, following, these, events, there, was, a, period, from, which, only, a, village, level, of, culture, seems, to, have, existed, this, period, is, thus, often, referred, to, as, the, greek, dark, age, the, art, history, of, the, hellenic, era, is, generally, subdivided, into, four, periods, the, protogeometric, 1100, 900, bc, the, geometric, 900, 700, bc, the, archaic, 700, 500, bc, and, the, classical, 500, 323, bc, with, sculpture, being, further, divided, into, severe, classical, high, classical, and, late, classical, the, first, signs, of, the, particular, artistic, character, that, defines, ancient, greek, architecture, are, to, be, seen, in, the, pottery, of, the, dorian, greeks, from, the, 10th, century, bc, already, at, this, period, it, is, created, with, a, sense, of, proportion, symmetry, and, balance, not, apparent, in, similar, pottery, from, crete, and, mycenae, the, decoration, is, precisely, geometric, and, ordered, neatly, into, zones, on, defined, areas, of, each, vessel, these, qualities, were, to, manifest, themselves, not, only, through, a, millennium, of, greek, pottery, making, but, also, in, the, architecture, that, was, to, emerge, in, the, 6th, century, the, major, development, that, occurred, was, in, the, growing, use, of, the, human, figure, as, the, major, decorative, motif, and, the, increasing, surety, with, which, humanity, its, mythology, activities, and, passions, were, depicted, the, development, in, the, depiction, of, the, human, form, in, pottery, was, accompanied, by, a, similar, development, in, sculpture, the, tiny, stylised, bronzes, of, the, geometric, period, gave, way, to, life, sized, highly, formalised, monolithic, representation, in, the, archaic, period, the, classical, period, was, marked, by, a, rapid, development, towards, idealised, but, increasingly, lifelike, depictions, of, gods, in, human, form, this, development, had, a, direct, effect, on, the, sculptural, decoration, of, temples, as, many, of, the, greatest, extant, works, of, ancient, greek, sculpture, once, adorned, temples, and, many, of, the, largest, recorded, statues, of, the, age, such, as, the, lost, chryselephantine, statues, of, zeus, at, the, temple, of, zeus, at, olympia, and, athena, at, the, parthenon, athens, both, over, 40, feet, high, were, once, housed, in, them, the, religion, of, ancient, greece, was, a, form, of, nature, worship, that, grew, out, of, the, beliefs, of, earlier, cultures, however, unlike, earlier, cultures, man, was, no, longer, perceived, as, being, threatened, by, nature, but, as, its, sublime, product, the, natural, elements, were, personified, as, gods, of, the, complete, human, form, and, very, human, behaviour, the, home, of, the, gods, was, thought, to, be, olympus, the, highest, mountain, in, greece, the, most, important, deities, were, zeus, the, supreme, god, and, ruler, of, the, sky, hera, his, wife, and, goddess, of, marriage, athena, goddess, of, wisdom, poseidon, the, god, of, the, sea, demeter, goddess, of, the, harvest, apollo, the, god, of, the, sun, law, healing, plague, reason, music, and, poetry, artemis, goddess, of, chastity, the, hunt, and, the, wilderness, aphrodite, goddess, of, love, ares, god, of, war, hermes, the, god, of, commerce, and, travellers, hephaestus, the, god, of, fire, and, metalwork, and, dionysus, the, god, of, wine, and, fruit, bearing, plants, worship, like, many, other, activities, was, done, in, the, community, in, the, open, however, by, 600, bc, the, gods, were, often, represented, by, large, statues, and, it, was, necessary, to, provide, a, building, in, which, each, of, these, could, be, housed, this, led, to, the, development, of, temples, the, ancient, greeks, perceived, order, in, the, universe, and, in, turn, applied, order, and, reason, to, their, creations, their, humanist, philosophy, put, mankind, at, the, centre, of, things, and, promoted, well, ordered, societies, and, the, development, of, democracy, at, the, same, time, the, respect, for, human, intellect, demanded, a, reason, and, promoted, a, passion, for, enquiry, logic, challenge, and, problem, solving, the, architecture, of, the, ancient, greeks, and, in, particular, temple, architecture, responds, to, these, challenges, with, a, passion, for, beauty, and, for, order, and, symmetry, which, is, the, product, of, a, continual, search, for, perfection, rather, than, a, simple, application, of, a, set, of, working, rules, there, is, a, clear, division, between, the, architecture, of, the, preceding, mycenaean, and, minoan, cultures, and, that, of, the, ancient, greeks, with, much, of, the, techniques, and, an, understanding, of, their, style, being, lost, when, these, civilisations, fell, mycenaean, architecture, is, marked, by, massive, fortifications, typically, surrounding, a, citadel, with, a, royal, palace, much, smaller, than, the, rambling, minoan, palaces, and, relatively, few, other, buildings, the, megaron, a, rectangular, hall, with, a, hearth, in, the, centre, was, the, largest, room, in, the, palaces, and, also, larger, houses, sun, dried, brick, above, rubble, bases, were, the, usual, materials, with, wooden, columns, and, roof, beams, rows, of, ashlar, stone, orthostats, lined, the, base, of, walls, in, some, prominent, locations, the, minoan, architecture, of, crete, was, of, the, trabeated, form, like, that, of, ancient, greece, it, employed, wooden, columns, with, capitals, but, the, wooden, columns, were, of, a, very, different, form, to, doric, columns, being, narrow, at, the, base, and, splaying, upward, the, earliest, forms, of, columns, in, greece, seem, to, have, developed, independently, as, with, minoan, architecture, ancient, greek, domestic, architecture, centred, on, open, spaces, or, courtyards, surrounded, by, colonnades, this, form, was, adapted, to, the, construction, of, hypostyle, halls, within, the, larger, temples, the, evolution, that, occurred, in, architecture, was, towards, the, public, building, first, and, foremost, the, temple, rather, than, towards, grand, domestic, architecture, such, as, had, evolved, in, crete, if, the, cretan, palaces, were, indeed, domestic, which, remains, uncertain, some, mycenaean, tombs, are, marked, by, circular, structures, and, tapered, domes, with, flat, bedded, cantilevered, courses, this, architectural, form, did, not, carry, over, into, the, architecture, of, ancient, greece, but, reappeared, about, 400, bc, in, the, interior, of, large, monumental, tombs, such, as, the, lion, tomb, at, knidos, c, 350, bc, the, greek, word, for, the, family, or, household, oikos, is, also, the, name, for, the, house, houses, followed, several, different, types, it, is, probable, that, many, of, the, earliest, houses, were, simple, structures, of, two, rooms, with, an, open, porch, or, pronaos, above, which, rose, a, low, pitched, gable, or, pediment, this, form, is, thought, to, have, contributed, to, temple, architecture, the, construction, of, many, houses, employed, walls, of, sun, dried, clay, bricks, or, wooden, framework, filled, with, fibrous, material, such, as, straw, or, seaweed, covered, with, clay, or, plaster, on, a, base, of, stone, which, protected, the, more, vulnerable, elements, from, damp, the, roofs, were, probably, of, thatch, with, eaves, which, overhung, the, permeable, walls, many, larger, houses, such, as, those, at, delos, were, built, of, stone, and, plastered, the, roofing, material, for, the, substantial, house, was, tile, houses, of, the, wealthy, had, mosaic, floors, and, demonstrated, the, classical, style, many, houses, centred, on, a, wide, passage, or, pasta, which, ran, the, length, of, the, house, and, opened, at, one, side, onto, a, small, courtyard, which, admitted, light, and, air, larger, houses, had, a, fully, developed, peristyle, courtyard, at, the, centre, with, the, rooms, arranged, around, it, some, houses, had, an, upper, floor, which, appears, to, have, been, reserved, for, the, use, of, the, women, of, the, family, city, houses, were, built, with, adjoining, walls, and, were, divided, into, small, blocks, by, narrow, streets, shops, were, sometimes, located, in, the, rooms, towards, the, street, city, houses, were, inward, facing, with, major, openings, looking, onto, the, central, courtyard, rather, than, the, street, the, rectangular, temple, is, the, most, common, and, best, known, form, of, greek, public, architecture, this, rectilinear, structure, borrows, from, the, late, helladic, mycenaean, megaron, which, contained, a, central, throne, room, vestibule, and, porch, the, temple, did, not, serve, the, same, function, as, a, modern, church, since, the, altar, stood, under, the, open, sky, in, the, temenos, or, sacred, precinct, often, directly, before, the, temple, temples, served, as, the, location, of, a, cult, image, and, as, a, storage, place, or, strong, room, for, the, treasury, associated, with, the, cult, of, the, god, in, question, and, as, a, place, for, devotees, of, the, god, to, leave, their, votive, offerings, such, as, statues, helmets, and, weapons, some, greek, temples, appear, to, have, been, oriented, astronomically, the, temple, was, generally, part, of, a, religious, precinct, known, as, the, acropolis, according, to, aristotle, the, site, should, be, a, spot, seen, far, and, wide, which, gives, good, elevation, to, virtue, and, towers, over, the, neighbourhood, small, circular, temples, tholoi, were, also, constructed, as, well, as, small, temple, like, buildings, that, served, as, treasuries, for, specific, groups, of, donors, during, the, late, 5th, and, 4th, centuries, bc, town, planning, became, an, important, consideration, of, greek, builders, with, towns, such, as, paestum, and, priene, being, laid, out, with, a, regular, grid, of, paved, streets, and, an, agora, or, central, market, place, surrounded, by, a, colonnade, or, stoa, the, completely, restored, stoa, of, attalos, can, be, seen, in, athens, towns, were, also, equipped, with, a, public, fountain, where, water, could, be, collected, for, household, use, the, development, of, regular, town, plans, is, associated, with, hippodamus, of, miletus, a, pupil, of, pythagoras, public, buildings, became, dignified, and, gracious, structures, and, were, sited, so, that, they, related, to, each, other, architecturally, the, propylon, or, porch, formed, the, entrance, to, temple, sanctuaries, and, other, significant, sites, with, the, best, surviving, example, being, the, propylaea, on, the, acropolis, of, athens, the, bouleuterion, was, a, large, public, building, with, a, hypostyle, hall, that, served, as, a, court, house, and, as, a, meeting, place, for, the, town, council, boule, remnants, of, bouleuterion, survive, at, athens, olympia, and, miletus, the, latter, having, held, up, to, 1, 200, people, every, greek, town, had, an, open, air, theatre, these, were, used, for, both, public, meetings, as, well, as, dramatic, performances, the, theatre, was, usually, set, in, a, hillside, outside, the, town, and, had, rows, of, tiered, seating, set, in, a, semicircle, around, the, central, performance, area, the, orchestra, behind, the, orchestra, was, a, low, building, called, the, sk, n, which, served, as, a, store, room, a, dressing, room, and, also, as, a, backdrop, to, the, action, taking, place, in, the, orchestra, a, number, of, greek, theatres, survive, almost, intact, the, best, known, being, at, epidaurus, by, the, architect, polykleitos, the, younger, greek, towns, of, substantial, size, also, had, a, palaestra, or, a, gymnasium, the, social, centre, for, male, citizens, which, included, spectator, areas, baths, toilets, and, club, rooms, other, buildings, associated, with, sports, include, the, hippodrome, for, horse, racing, of, which, only, remnants, have, survived, and, the, stadium, for, foot, racing, 600, feet, in, length, of, which, examples, exist, at, olympia, delphi, epidaurus, and, ephesus, while, the, panathinaiko, stadium, in, athens, which, seats, 45, 000, people, was, restored, in, the, 19th, century, and, was, used, in, the, 1896, 1906, and, 2004, olympic, games, the, architecture, of, ancient, greece, is, of, a, trabeated, or, post, and, lintel, form, i, e, it, is, composed, of, upright, beams, posts, supporting, horizontal, beams, lintels, although, the, existent, buildings, of, the, era, are, constructed, in, stone, it, is, clear, that, the, origin, of, the, style, lies, in, simple, wooden, structures, with, vertical, posts, supporting, beams, which, carried, a, ridged, roof, the, posts, and, beams, divided, the, walls, into, regular, compartments, which, could, be, left, as, openings, or, filled, with, sun, dried, bricks, lathes, or, straw, and, covered, with, clay, daub, or, plaster, alternately, the, spaces, might, be, filled, with, rubble, it, is, likely, that, many, early, houses, and, temples, were, constructed, with, an, open, porch, or, pronaos, above, which, rose, a, low, pitched, gable, or, pediment, the, earliest, temples, built, to, enshrine, statues, of, deities, were, probably, of, wooden, construction, later, replaced, by, the, more, durable, stone, temples, many, of, which, are, still, in, evidence, today, the, signs, of, the, original, timber, nature, of, the, architecture, were, maintained, in, the, stone, buildings, a, few, of, these, temples, are, very, large, with, several, such, as, the, temple, of, zeus, olympus, and, the, olympians, at, athens, being, well, over, 300, feet, in, length, but, most, were, less, than, half, this, size, it, appears, that, some, of, the, large, temples, began, as, wooden, constructions, in, which, the, columns, were, replaced, piecemeal, as, stone, became, available, this, at, least, was, the, interpretation, of, the, historian, pausanias, looking, at, the, temple, of, hera, at, olympia, in, the, 2nd, century, ad, the, stone, columns, are, made, of, a, series, of, solid, stone, cylinders, or, drums, that, rest, on, each, other, without, mortar, but, were, sometimes, centred, with, a, bronze, pin, the, columns, are, wider, at, the, base, than, at, the, top, tapering, with, an, outward, curve, known, as, entasis, each, column, has, a, capital, of, two, parts, the, upper, on, which, rests, the, lintels, being, square, and, called, the, abacus, the, part, of, the, capital, that, rises, from, the, column, itself, is, called, the, echinus, it, differs, according, to, the, order, being, plain, in, the, doric, order, fluted, in, the, ionic, and, foliate, in, the, corinthian, doric, and, usually, ionic, capitals, are, cut, with, vertical, grooves, known, as, fluting, this, fluting, or, grooving, of, the, columns, is, a, retention, of, an, element, of, the, original, wooden, architecture, the, columns, of, a, temple, support, a, structure, that, rises, in, two, main, stages, the, entablature, and, the, pediment, the, entablature, is, the, major, horizontal, structural, element, supporting, the, roof, and, encircling, the, entire, building, it, is, composed, of, three, parts, resting, on, the, columns, is, the, architrave, made, of, a, series, of, stone, lintels, that, spanned, the, space, between, the, columns, and, meet, each, other, at, a, joint, directly, above, the, centre, of, each, column, above, the, architrave, is, a, second, horizontal, stage, called, the, frieze, the, frieze, is, one, of, the, major, decorative, elements, of, the, building, and, carries, a, sculptured, relief, in, the, case, of, ionic, and, corinthian, architecture, the, relief, decoration, runs, in, a, continuous, band, but, in, the, doric, order, it, is, divided, into, sections, called, metopes, which, fill, the, spaces, between, vertical, rectangular, blocks, called, triglyphs, the, triglyphs, are, vertically, grooved, like, the, doric, columns, and, retain, the, form, of, the, wooden, beams, that, would, once, have, supported, the, roof, the, upper, band, of, the, entablature, is, called, the, cornice, which, is, generally, ornately, decorated, on, its, lower, edge, the, cornice, retains, the, shape, of, the, beams, that, would, once, have, supported, the, wooden, roof, at, each, end, of, the, building, at, the, front, and, rear, of, each, temple, the, entablature, supports, a, triangular, structure, called, the, pediment, the, tympanum, is, the, triangular, space, framed, by, the, cornices, and, the, location, of, the, most, significant, sculptural, decoration, on, the, exterior, of, the, building, every, temple, rested, on, a, masonry, base, called, the, crepidoma, generally, of, three, steps, of, which, the, upper, one, which, carried, the, columns, was, the, stylobate, masonry, walls, were, employed, for, temples, from, about, 600, bc, onwards, masonry, of, all, types, was, used, for, ancient, greek, buildings, including, rubble, but, the, finest, ashlar, masonry, was, usually, employed, for, temple, walls, in, regular, courses, and, large, sizes, to, minimise, the, joints, the, blocks, were, rough, hewn, and, hauled, from, quarries, to, be, cut, and, bedded, very, precisely, with, mortar, hardly, ever, being, used, blocks, particularly, those, of, columns, and, parts, of, the, building, bearing, loads, were, sometimes, fixed, in, place, or, reinforced, with, iron, clamps, dowels, and, rods, of, wood, bronze, or, iron, fixed, in, lead, to, minimise, corrosion, door, and, window, openings, were, spanned, with, a, lintel, which, in, a, stone, building, limited, the, possible, width, of, the, opening, the, distance, between, columns, was, similarly, affected, by, the, nature, of, the, lintel, columns, on, the, exterior, of, buildings, and, carrying, stone, lintels, being, closer, together, than, those, on, the, interior, which, carried, wooden, lintels, door, and, window, openings, narrowed, towards, the, top, temples, were, constructed, without, windows, the, light, to, the, naos, entering, through, the, door, it, has, been, suggested, that, some, temples, were, lit, from, openings, in, the, roof, a, door, of, the, ionic, order, at, the, erechtheion, 17, feet, high, and, 7, 5, feet, wide, at, the, top, retains, many, of, its, features, intact, including, mouldings, and, an, entablature, supported, on, console, brackets, see, architectural, decoration, below, the, widest, span, of, a, temple, roof, was, across, the, cella, or, inner, chamber, in, a, large, building, this, space, contains, columns, to, support, the, roof, the, architectural, form, being, known, as, hypostyle, it, appears, that, although, the, architecture, of, ancient, greece, was, initially, of, wooden, construction, the, early, builders, did, not, have, the, concept, of, the, diagonal, truss, as, a, stabilising, member, this, is, evidenced, by, the, nature, of, temple, construction, in, the, 6th, century, bc, where, the, rows, of, columns, supporting, the, roof, the, cella, rise, higher, than, the, outer, walls, unnecessary, if, roof, trusses, are, employed, as, an, integral, part, of, the, wooden, roof, the, indication, is, that, initially, all, the, rafters, were, supported, directly, by, the, entablature, walls, and, hypostyle, rather, than, on, a, trussed, wooden, frame, which, came, into, use, in, greek, architecture, only, in, the, 3rd, century, bc, ancient, greek, buildings, of, timber, clay, and, plaster, construction, were, probably, roofed, with, thatch, with, the, rise, of, stone, architecture, came, the, appearance, of, fired, ceramic, roof, tiles, these, early, roof, tiles, showed, an, s, shape, with, the, pan, and, cover, tile, forming, one, piece, they, were, much, larger, than, modern, roof, tiles, being, up, to, 90, cm, 35, 43, in, long, 70, cm, 27, 56, in, wide, 3, 4, cm, 1, 18, 1, 57, in, thick, and, weighing, around, 30, kg, 66, lb, apiece, only, stone, walls, which, were, replacing, the, earlier, mudbrick, and, wood, walls, were, strong, enough, to, support, the, weight, of, a, tiled, roof, the, earliest, finds, of, roof, tiles, of, the, archaic, period, in, greece, are, documented, from, a, very, restricted, area, around, corinth, where, fired, tiles, began, to, replace, thatched, roofs, at, the, temples, of, apollo, and, poseidon, between, 700, and, 650, bc, spreading, rapidly, roof, tiles, were, within, fifty, years, in, evidence, for, a, large, number, of, sites, around, the, eastern, mediterranean, including, mainland, greece, western, asia, minor, southern, and, central, italy, being, more, expensive, and, labour, intensive, to, produce, than, thatch, their, introduction, has, been, explained, by, the, fact, that, their, fireproof, quality, would, have, given, desired, protection, to, the, costly, temples, as, a, side, effect, it, has, been, assumed, that, the, new, stone, and, tile, construction, also, ushered, in, the, end, of, overhanging, eaves, in, greek, architecture, as, they, made, the, need, for, an, extended, roof, as, rain, protection, for, the, mudbrick, walls, obsolete, vaults, and, arches, were, not, generally, used, but, begin, to, appear, in, tombs, in, a, beehive, or, cantilevered, form, such, as, used, in, mycenaea, and, occasionally, as, an, external, feature, exedrae, of, voussoired, construction, from, the, 5th, century, bc, the, dome, and, vault, never, became, significant, structural, features, as, they, were, to, become, in, ancient, roman, architecture, most, ancient, greek, temples, were, rectangular, and, were, approximately, twice, as, long, as, they, were, wide, with, some, notable, exceptions, such, as, the, enormous, temple, of, olympian, zeus, athens, with, a, length, of, nearly, 2, 1, 2, times, its, width, a, number, of, surviving, temple, like, structures, are, circular, and, are, referred, to, as, tholos, the, smallest, temples, are, less, than, 25, metres, approx, 75, feet, in, length, or, in, the, case, of, the, circular, tholos, in, diameter, the, great, majority, of, temples, are, between, 30, and, 60, metres, approx, 100, 200, feet, in, length, a, small, group, of, doric, temples, including, the, parthenon, are, between, 60, and, 80, metres, approx, 200, 260, feet, in, length, the, largest, temples, mainly, ionic, and, corinthian, but, including, the, doric, temple, of, the, olympian, zeus, agrigento, were, between, 90, and, 120, metres, approx, 300, 390, feet, in, length, the, temple, rises, from, a, stepped, base, or, stylobate, which, elevates, the, structure, above, the, ground, on, which, it, stands, early, examples, such, as, the, temple, of, zeus, at, olympus, have, two, steps, but, the, majority, like, the, parthenon, have, three, with, the, exceptional, example, of, the, temple, of, apollo, at, didyma, having, six, the, core, of, the, building, is, a, masonry, built, naos, within, which, is, a, cella, a, windowless, room, originally, housing, the, statue, of, the, god, the, cella, generally, has, a, porch, or, pronaos, before, it, and, perhaps, a, second, chamber, or, antenaos, serving, as, a, treasury, or, repository, for, trophies, and, gifts, the, chambers, were, lit, by, a, single, large, doorway, fitted, with, a, wrought, iron, grill, some, rooms, appear, to, have, been, illuminated, by, skylights, on, the, stylobate, often, completely, surrounding, the, naos, stand, rows, of, columns, each, temple, is, defined, as, being, of, a, particular, type, with, two, terms, one, describing, the, number, of, columns, across, the, entrance, front, and, the, other, defining, their, distribution, examples, the, ideal, of, proportion, that, was, used, by, ancient, greek, architects, in, designing, temples, was, not, a, simple, mathematical, progression, using, a, square, module, the, math, involved, a, more, complex, geometrical, progression, the, so, called, golden, mean, the, ratio, is, similar, to, that, of, the, growth, patterns, of, many, spiral, forms, that, occur, in, nature, such, as, rams, horns, nautilus, shells, fern, fronds, and, vine, tendrils, and, which, were, a, source, of, decorative, motifs, employed, by, ancient, greek, architects, as, particularly, in, evidence, in, the, volutes, of, capitals, of, the, ionic, and, corinthian, orders, the, ancient, greek, architects, took, a, philosophic, approach, to, the, rules, and, proportions, the, determining, factor, in, the, mathematics, of, any, notable, work, of, architecture, was, its, ultimate, appearance, the, architects, calculated, for, perspective, for, the, optical, illusions, that, make, edges, of, objects, appear, concave, and, for, the, fact, that, columns, that, are, viewed, against, the, sky, look, different, from, those, adjacent, that, are, viewed, against, a, shadowed, wall, because, of, these, factors, the, architects, adjusted, the, plans, so, that, the, major, lines, of, any, significant, building, are, rarely, straight, the, most, obvious, adjustment, is, to, the, profile, of, columns, which, narrow, from, base, to, top, however, the, narrowing, is, not, regular, but, gently, curved, so, that, each, column, appears, to, have, a, slight, swelling, called, entasis, below, the, middle, the, entasis, is, never, sufficiently, pronounced, as, to, make, the, swelling, wider, than, the, base, it, is, controlled, by, a, slight, reduction, in, the, rate, of, decrease, of, diameter, the, parthenon, the, temple, to, the, goddess, athena, on, the, acropolis, in, athens, is, referred, to, by, many, as, the, pinnacle, of, ancient, greek, architecture, helen, gardner, refers, to, its, unsurpassable, excellence, to, be, surveyed, studied, and, emulated, by, architects, of, later, ages, yet, as, gardner, points, out, there, is, hardly, a, straight, line, in, the, building, banister, fletcher, calculated, that, the, stylobate, curves, upward, so, that, its, centres, at, either, end, rise, about, 65, millimetres, 2, 6, inches, above, the, outer, corners, and, 110, mm, 4, 3, in, on, the, longer, sides, a, slightly, greater, adjustment, has, been, made, to, the, entablature, the, columns, at, the, ends, of, the, building, are, not, vertical, but, are, inclined, towards, the, centre, with, those, at, the, corners, being, out, of, plumb, by, about, 65, mm, 2, 6, in, these, outer, columns, are, both, slightly, wider, than, their, neighbours, and, are, slightly, closer, than, any, of, the, others, ancient, greek, architecture, of, the, most, formal, type, for, temples, and, other, public, buildings, is, divided, stylistically, into, three, classical, orders, first, described, by, the, roman, architectural, writer, vitruvius, these, are, the, doric, order, the, ionic, order, and, the, corinthian, order, the, names, reflecting, their, regional, origins, within, the, greek, world, while, the, three, orders, are, most, easily, recognizable, by, their, capitals, they, also, governed, the, form, proportions, details, and, relationships, of, the, columns, entablature, pediment, and, the, stylobate, the, different, orders, were, applied, to, the, whole, range, of, buildings, and, monuments, the, doric, order, developed, on, mainland, greece, and, spread, to, magna, graecia, italy, it, was, firmly, established, and, well, defined, in, its, characteristics, by, the, time, of, the, building, of, the, temple, of, hera, at, olympia, c, 600, bc, the, ionic, order, co, existed, with, the, doric, being, favoured, by, the, greek, cities, of, ionia, in, asia, minor, and, the, aegean, islands, it, did, not, reach, a, clearly, defined, form, until, the, mid, 5th, century, bc, the, early, ionic, temples, of, asia, minor, were, particularly, ambitious, in, scale, such, as, the, temple, of, artemis, at, ephesus, the, corinthian, order, was, a, highly, decorative, variant, not, developed, until, the, hellenistic, period, and, retaining, many, characteristics, of, the, ionic, it, was, popularised, by, the, romans, the, doric, order, is, recognised, by, its, capital, of, which, the, echinus, is, like, a, circular, cushion, rising, from, the, top, of, the, column, to, the, square, abacus, on, which, rest, the, lintels, the, echinus, appears, flat, and, splayed, in, early, examples, deeper, and, with, greater, curve, in, later, more, refined, examples, and, smaller, and, straight, sided, in, hellenistic, examples, a, refinement, of, the, doric, column, is, the, entasis, a, gentle, convex, swelling, to, the, profile, of, the, column, which, prevents, an, optical, illusion, of, concavity, this, is, more, pronounced, in, earlier, examples, doric, columns, are, almost, always, cut, with, grooves, known, as, fluting, which, run, the, length, of, the, column, and, are, usually, 20, in, number, although, sometimes, fewer, the, flutes, meet, at, sharp, edges, called, arrises, at, the, top, of, the, columns, slightly, below, the, narrowest, point, and, crossing, the, terminating, arrises, are, three, horizontal, grooves, known, as, the, hypotrachelion, doric, columns, have, no, bases, until, a, few, examples, in, the, hellenistic, period, the, columns, of, an, early, doric, temple, such, as, the, temple, of, apollo, at, syracuse, sicily, may, have, a, height, to, base, diameter, ratio, of, only, 4, 1, and, a, column, height, to, entablature, ratio, of, 2, 1, with, relatively, crude, details, a, column, height, to, diameter, of, 6, 1, became, more, usual, while, the, column, height, to, entablature, ratio, at, the, parthenon, is, about, 3, 1, during, the, hellenistic, period, doric, conventions, of, solidity, and, masculinity, dropped, away, with, the, slender, and, unfluted, columns, reaching, a, height, to, diameter, ratio, of, 7, 5, 1, the, doric, entablature, is, in, three, parts, the, architrave, the, frieze, and, the, cornice, the, architrave, is, composed, of, the, stone, lintels, which, span, the, space, between, the, columns, with, a, joint, occurring, above, the, centre, of, each, abacus, on, this, rests, the, frieze, one, of, the, major, areas, of, sculptural, decoration, the, frieze, is, divided, into, triglyphs, and, metopes, the, triglyphs, as, stated, elsewhere, in, this, article, are, a, reminder, of, the, timber, history, of, the, architectural, style, each, triglyph, has, three, vertical, grooves, similar, to, the, columnar, fluting, and, below, them, seemingly, connected, are, guttae, small, strips, that, appear, to, connect, the, triglyphs, to, the, architrave, below, a, triglyph, is, located, above, the, centre, of, each, capital, and, above, the, centre, of, each, lintel, however, at, the, corners, of, the, building, the, triglyphs, do, not, fall, over, the, centre, the, column, the, ancient, architects, took, a, pragmatic, approach, to, the, apparent, rules, simply, extending, the, width, of, the, last, two, metopes, at, each, end, of, the, building, the, cornice, is, a, narrow, jutting, band, of, complex, molding, which, overhangs, and, protects, the, ornamented, frieze, like, the, edge, of, an, overhanging, wooden, framed, roof, it, is, decorated, on, the, underside, with, projecting, blocks, mutules, further, suggesting, the, wooden, nature, of, the, prototype, at, either, end, of, the, building, the, pediment, rises, from, the, cornice, framed, by, moulding, of, similar, form, the, pediment, is, decorated, with, figures, that, are, in, relief, in, the, earlier, examples, though, almost, free, standing, by, the, time, of, the, sculpture, on, the, parthenon, early, architectural, sculptors, found, difficulty, in, creating, satisfactory, sculptural, compositions, in, the, tapering, triangular, space, by, the, early, classical, period, with, the, decoration, of, the, temple, of, zeus, at, olympia, 486, 460, bc, the, sculptors, had, solved, the, problem, by, having, a, standing, central, figure, framed, by, rearing, centaurs, and, fighting, men, who, are, falling, kneeling, and, lying, in, attitudes, that, fit, the, size, and, angle, of, each, part, of, the, space, the, famous, sculptor, phidias, fills, the, space, at, the, parthenon, 448, 432, bc, with, a, complex, array, of, draped, and, undraped, figures, of, deities, who, appear, in, attitudes, of, sublime, relaxation, and, elegance, the, ionic, order, is, recognized, by, its, voluted, capital, in, which, a, curved, echinus, of, similar, shape, to, that, of, the, doric, order, but, decorated, with, stylised, ornament, is, surmounted, by, a, horizontal, band, that, scrolls, under, to, either, side, forming, spirals, or, volutes, similar, to, those, of, the, nautilus, shell, or, ram, s, horn, in, plan, the, capital, is, rectangular, it, is, designed, to, be, viewed, frontally, but, the, capitals, at, the, corners, of, buildings, are, modified, with, an, additional, scroll, so, as, to, appear, regular, on, two, adjoining, faces, in, the, hellenistic, period, four, fronted, ionic, capitals, became, common, like, the, doric, order, the, ionic, order, retains, signs, of, having, its, origins, in, wooden, architecture, the, horizontal, spread, of, a, flat, timber, plate, across, the, top, of, a, column, is, a, common, device, in, wooden, construction, giving, a, thin, upright, a, wider, area, on, which, to, bear, the, lintel, while, at, the, same, time, reinforcing, the, load, bearing, strength, of, the, lintel, itself, likewise, the, columns, always, have, bases, a, necessity, in, wooden, architecture, to, spread, the, load, and, protect, the, base, of, a, comparatively, thin, upright, the, columns, are, fluted, with, narrow, shallow, flutes, that, do, not, meet, at, a, sharp, edge, but, have, a, flat, band, or, fillet, between, them, the, usual, number, of, flutes, is, twenty, four, but, there, may, be, as, many, as, forty, four, the, base, has, two, convex, mouldings, called, torus, and, from, the, late, hellenic, period, stood, on, a, square, plinth, similar, to, the, abacus, the, architrave, of, the, ionic, order, is, sometimes, undecorated, but, more, often, rises, in, three, outwardly, stepped, bands, like, overlapping, timber, planks, the, frieze, which, runs, in, a, continuous, band, is, separated, from, the, other, members, by, rows, of, small, projecting, blocks, they, are, referred, to, as, dentils, meaning, teeth, but, their, origin, is, clearly, in, narrow, wooden, slats, which, supported, the, roof, of, a, timber, structure, the, ionic, order, is, altogether, lighter, in, appearance, than, the, doric, with, the, columns, including, base, and, capital, having, a, 9, 1, ratio, with, the, diameter, while, the, whole, entablature, was, also, much, narrower, and, less, heavy, than, the, doric, entablature, there, was, some, variation, in, the, distribution, of, decoration, formalised, bands, of, motifs, such, as, alternating, forms, known, as, egg, and, dart, were, a, feature, of, the, ionic, entablatures, along, with, the, bands, of, dentils, the, external, frieze, often, contained, a, continuous, band, of, figurative, sculpture, or, ornament, but, this, was, not, always, the, case, sometimes, a, decorative, frieze, occurred, around, the, upper, part, of, the, naos, rather, than, on, the, exterior, of, the, building, these, ionic, style, friezes, around, the, naos, are, sometimes, found, on, doric, buildings, notably, the, parthenon, some, temples, like, the, temple, of, artemis, at, ephesus, had, friezes, of, figures, around, the, lower, drum, of, each, column, separated, from, the, fluted, section, by, a, bold, moulding, caryatids, draped, female, figures, used, as, supporting, members, to, carry, the, entablature, were, a, feature, of, the, ionic, order, occurring, at, several, buildings, including, the, siphnian, treasury, at, delphi, in, 525, bc, and, at, the, erechtheion, about, 410, bc, the, corinthian, order, does, not, have, its, origin, in, wooden, architecture, it, grew, directly, out, of, the, ionic, in, the, mid, 5th, century, bc, and, was, initially, of, much, the, same, style, and, proportion, but, distinguished, by, its, more, ornate, capitals, the, capital, was, very, much, deeper, than, either, the, doric, or, the, ionic, capital, being, shaped, like, a, large, krater, a, bell, shaped, mixing, bowl, and, being, ornamented, with, a, double, row, of, acanthus, leaves, above, which, rose, voluted, tendrils, supporting, the, corners, of, the, abacus, which, no, longer, perfectly, square, splayed, above, them, according, to, vitruvius, the, capital, was, invented, by, a, bronze, founder, callimachus, of, corinth, who, took, his, inspiration, from, a, basket, of, offerings, that, had, been, placed, on, a, grave, with, a, flat, tile, on, top, to, protect, the, goods, the, basket, had, been, placed, on, the, root, of, an, acanthus, plant, which, had, grown, up, around, it, the, ratio, of, the, column, height, to, diameter, is, generally, 10, 1, with, the, capital, taking, up, more, than, 1, 10, of, the, height, the, ratio, of, capital, height, to, diameter, is, generally, about, 1, 16, 1, the, corinthian, order, was, initially, used, internally, as, at, the, temple, of, apollo, epicurius, at, bassae, c, 450, 425, bc, in, 334, bc, it, appeared, as, an, external, feature, on, the, choragic, monument, of, lysicrates, in, athens, and, then, on, a, huge, scale, at, the, temple, of, zeus, olympia, in, athens, 174, bc, 132, ad, it, was, popularised, by, the, romans, who, added, a, number, of, refinements, and, decorative, details, during, the, hellenistic, period, corinthian, columns, were, sometimes, built, without, fluting, early, wooden, structures, particularly, temples, were, ornamented, and, in, part, protected, by, fired, and, painted, terracotta, revetments, in, the, form, of, rectangular, panels, and, ornamental, discs, many, fragments, of, these, have, outlived, the, buildings, that, they, decorated, and, demonstrate, a, wealth, of, formal, border, designs, of, geometric, scrolls, overlapping, patterns, and, foliate, motifs, with, the, introduction, of, stone, built, temples, the, revetments, no, longer, served, a, protective, purpose, and, sculptured, decoration, became, more, common, the, clay, ornaments, were, limited, to, the, roof, of, buildings, decorating, the, cornice, the, corners, and, surmounting, the, pediment, at, the, corners, of, pediments, they, were, called, acroteria, and, along, the, sides, of, the, building, antefixes, early, decorative, elements, were, generally, semi, circular, but, later, of, roughly, triangular, shape, with, moulded, ornament, often, palmate, ionic, cornices, were, often, set, with, a, row, of, lion, s, masks, with, open, mouths, that, ejected, rainwater, from, the, late, classical, period, acroteria, were, sometimes, sculptured, figures, see, architectural, sculpture, in, the, three, orders, of, ancient, greek, architecture, the, sculptural, decoration, be, it, a, simple, half, round, astragal, a, frieze, of, stylised, foliage, or, the, ornate, sculpture, of, the, pediment, is, all, essential, to, the, architecture, of, which, it, is, a, part, in, the, doric, order, there, is, no, variation, in, its, placement, reliefs, never, decorate, walls, in, an, arbitrary, way, the, sculpture, is, always, located, in, several, predetermined, areas, the, metopes, and, the, pediment, in, later, ionic, architecture, there, is, greater, diversity, in, the, types, and, numbers, of, mouldings, and, decorations, particularly, around, doorways, where, voluted, brackets, sometimes, occur, supporting, an, ornamental, cornice, over, a, door, such, as, that, at, the, erechtheion, a, much, applied, narrow, moulding, is, called, bead, and, reel, and, is, symmetrical, stemming, from, turned, wooden, prototypes, wider, mouldings, include, one, with, tongue, like, or, pointed, leaf, shapes, which, are, grooved, and, sometimes, turned, upward, at, the, tip, and, egg, and, dart, moulding, which, alternates, ovoid, shapes, with, narrow, pointed, ones, architectural, sculpture, showed, a, development, from, early, archaic, examples, through, severe, classical, high, classical, late, classical, and, hellenistic, remnants, of, archaic, architectural, sculpture, 700, 500, bc, exist, from, the, early, 6th, century, bc, with, the, earliest, surviving, pedimental, sculptures, being, fragments, of, a, gorgon, flanked, by, heraldic, panthers, from, the, centre, of, the, pediment, of, the, artemis, temple, of, corfu, a, metope, from, a, temple, known, as, temple, c, at, selinus, sicily, shows, in, a, better, preserved, state, perseus, slaying, the, gorgon, medusa, both, images, parallel, the, stylised, depiction, of, the, gorgons, on, the, black, figure, name, vase, decorated, by, the, nessos, painter, c, 600, bc, with, the, face, and, shoulders, turned, frontally, and, the, legs, in, a, running, or, kneeling, position, at, this, date, images, of, terrifying, monsters, have, predominance, over, the, emphasis, on, the, human, figure, that, developed, with, humanist, philosophy, early, pedimental, sculptures, and, those, on, smaller, temples, were, usually, in, relief, and, the, late, free, standing, ones, were, often, in, terracotta, which, has, survived, only, in, fragments, the, sculptures, were, covered, with, a, layer, of, stucco, and, painted, or, if, terracotta, painted, with, the, more, restrained, fired, colours, of, greek, pottery, the, severe, classical, style, 500, 450, bc, is, represented, by, the, pedimental, sculptures, of, the, temple, of, zeus, at, olympia, 470, 456, bc, the, eastern, pediment, shows, a, moment, of, stillness, and, impending, drama, before, the, beginning, of, a, chariot, race, the, figures, of, zeus, and, the, competitors, being, severe, and, idealised, representations, of, the, human, form, the, western, pediment, has, apollo, as, the, central, figure, majestic, and, remote, presiding, over, a, battle, of, lapiths, and, centaurs, in, strong, contrast, to, that, of, the, eastern, pediment, for, its, depiction, of, violent, action, and, described, by, donald, e, strong, as, the, most, powerful, piece, of, illustration, for, a, hundred, years, the, reliefs, and, three, dimensional, sculpture, which, adorned, the, frieze, and, pediments, respectively, of, the, parthenon, are, the, lifelike, products, of, the, high, classical, style, 450, 400, bc, and, were, created, under, the, direction, of, the, sculptor, phidias, the, pedimental, sculpture, represents, the, gods, of, olympus, while, the, frieze, shows, the, panathenaic, procession, and, ceremonial, events, that, took, place, every, four, years, to, honour, the, titular, goddess, of, athens, the, frieze, and, remaining, figures, of, the, eastern, pediment, show, a, profound, understanding, of, the, human, body, and, how, it, varies, depending, upon, its, position, and, the, stresses, that, action, and, emotion, place, upon, it, benjamin, robert, haydon, described, the, reclining, figure, of, dionysus, as, the, most, heroic, style, of, art, combined, with, all, the, essential, detail, of, actual, life, the, names, of, many, famous, sculptors, are, known, from, the, late, classical, period, 400, 323, bc, including, timotheos, praxiteles, leochares, and, skopas, but, their, works, are, known, mainly, from, roman, copies, little, architectural, sculpture, of, the, period, remains, intact, the, temple, of, asclepius, at, epidauros, had, sculpture, by, timotheos, working, with, the, architect, theodotos, fragments, of, the, eastern, pediment, survive, showing, the, sack, of, troy, the, scene, appears, to, have, filled, the, space, with, figures, carefully, arranged, to, fit, the, slope, and, shape, available, as, with, the, earlier, east, pediment, of, the, temple, of, zeus, at, olympus, but, the, figures, are, more, violent, in, action, the, central, space, taken, up, not, with, a, commanding, god, but, with, the, dynamic, figure, of, neoptolemos, as, he, seizes, the, aged, king, priam, and, stabs, him, the, remaining, fragments, give, the, impression, of, a, range, of, human, emotions, fear, horror, cruelty, and, lust, for,
