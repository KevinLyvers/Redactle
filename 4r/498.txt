cubism, is, an, early, 20th, century, avant, garde, art, movement, begun, in, paris, that, revolutionized, painting, and, the, visual, arts, and, influenced, artistic, innovations, in, music, ballet, literature, and, architecture, cubist, subjects, are, analyzed, broken, up, and, reassembled, in, an, abstract, form, instead, of, depicting, objects, from, a, single, perspective, the, artist, depicts, the, subject, from, multiple, perspectives, to, represent, the, subject, in, a, greater, context, cubism, has, been, considered, the, most, influential, art, movement, of, the, 20th, century, the, term, cubism, is, broadly, associated, with, a, variety, of, artworks, produced, in, paris, montmartre, and, montparnasse, or, near, paris, puteaux, during, the, 1910s, and, throughout, the, 1920s, the, movement, was, pioneered, in, partnership, by, pablo, picasso, and, georges, braque, and, joined, by, jean, metzinger, albert, gleizes, robert, delaunay, henri, le, fauconnier, juan, gris, and, fernand, l, ger, one, primary, influence, that, led, to, cubism, was, the, representation, of, three, dimensional, form, in, the, late, works, of, paul, c, zanne, a, retrospective, of, c, zanne, s, paintings, was, held, at, the, salon, d, automne, of, 1904, current, works, were, displayed, at, the, 1905, and, 1906, salon, d, automne, followed, by, two, commemorative, retrospectives, after, his, death, in, 1907, in, france, offshoots, of, cubism, developed, including, orphism, abstract, art, and, later, purism, the, impact, of, cubism, was, far, reaching, and, wide, ranging, in, the, arts, and, in, popular, culture, cubism, introduced, collage, as, a, modern, art, form, in, france, and, other, countries, futurism, suprematism, dada, constructivism, de, stijl, and, art, deco, developed, in, response, to, cubism, early, futurist, paintings, hold, in, common, with, cubism, the, fusing, of, the, past, and, the, present, the, representation, of, different, views, of, the, subject, pictured, at, the, same, time, or, successively, also, called, multiple, perspective, simultaneity, or, multiplicity, while, constructivism, was, influenced, by, picasso, s, technique, of, constructing, sculpture, from, separate, elements, other, common, threads, between, these, disparate, movements, include, the, faceting, or, simplification, of, geometric, forms, and, the, association, of, mechanization, and, modern, life, scholars, have, divided, the, history, of, cubism, into, phases, in, one, scheme, the, first, phase, of, cubism, known, as, analytic, cubism, a, phrase, coined, by, juan, gris, a, posteriori, was, both, radical, and, influential, as, a, short, but, highly, significant, art, movement, between, 1910, and, 1912, in, france, a, second, phase, synthetic, cubism, remained, vital, until, around, 1919, when, the, surrealist, movement, gained, popularity, english, art, historian, douglas, cooper, proposed, another, scheme, describing, three, phases, of, cubism, in, his, book, the, cubist, epoch, according, to, cooper, there, was, early, cubism, from, 1906, to, 1908, when, the, movement, was, initially, developed, in, the, studios, of, picasso, and, braque, the, second, phase, being, called, high, cubism, from, 1909, to, 1914, during, which, time, juan, gris, emerged, as, an, important, exponent, after, 1911, and, finally, cooper, referred, to, late, cubism, from, 1914, to, 1921, as, the, last, phase, of, cubism, as, a, radical, avant, garde, movement, douglas, cooper, s, restrictive, use, of, these, terms, to, distinguish, the, work, of, braque, picasso, gris, from, 1911, and, l, ger, to, a, lesser, extent, implied, an, intentional, value, judgement, cubism, burgeoned, between, 1907, and, 1911, pablo, picasso, s, 1907, painting, les, demoiselles, d, avignon, has, often, been, considered, a, proto, cubist, work, in, 1908, in, his, review, of, georges, braque, s, exhibition, at, kahnweiler, s, gallery, the, critic, louis, vauxcelles, called, braque, a, daring, man, who, despises, form, reducing, everything, places, and, a, figures, and, houses, to, geometric, schemas, to, cubes, vauxcelles, recounted, how, matisse, told, him, at, the, time, braque, has, just, sent, in, a, painting, made, of, little, cubes, the, critic, charles, morice, relayed, matisse, s, words, and, spoke, of, braque, s, little, cubes, the, motif, of, the, viaduct, at, l, estaque, had, inspired, braque, to, produce, three, paintings, marked, by, the, simplification, of, form, and, deconstruction, of, perspective, georges, braque, s, 1908, houses, at, l, estaque, and, related, works, prompted, vauxcelles, in, gil, blas, 25, march, 1909, to, refer, to, bizarreries, cubiques, cubic, oddities, gertrude, stein, referred, to, landscapes, made, by, picasso, in, 1909, such, as, reservoir, at, horta, de, ebro, as, the, first, cubist, paintings, the, first, organized, group, exhibition, by, cubists, took, place, at, the, salon, des, ind, pendants, in, paris, during, the, spring, of, 1911, in, a, room, called, salle, 41, it, included, works, by, jean, metzinger, albert, gleizes, fernand, l, ger, robert, delaunay, and, henri, le, fauconnier, yet, no, works, by, picasso, or, braque, were, exhibited, by, 1911, picasso, was, recognized, as, the, inventor, of, cubism, while, braque, s, importance, and, precedence, was, argued, later, with, respect, to, his, treatment, of, space, volume, and, mass, in, the, l, estaque, landscapes, but, this, view, of, cubism, is, associated, with, a, distinctly, restrictive, definition, of, which, artists, are, properly, to, be, called, cubists, wrote, the, art, historian, christopher, green, marginalizing, the, contribution, of, the, artists, who, exhibited, at, the, salon, des, ind, pendants, in, 1911, the, assertion, that, the, cubist, depiction, of, space, mass, time, and, volume, supports, rather, than, contradicts, the, flatness, of, the, canvas, was, made, by, daniel, henry, kahnweiler, as, early, as, 1920, but, it, was, subject, to, criticism, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, especially, by, clement, greenberg, contemporary, views, of, cubism, are, complex, formed, to, some, extent, in, response, to, the, salle, 41, cubists, whose, methods, were, too, distinct, from, those, of, picasso, and, braque, to, be, considered, merely, secondary, to, them, alternative, interpretations, of, cubism, have, therefore, developed, wider, views, of, cubism, include, artists, who, were, later, associated, with, the, salle, 41, artists, e, g, francis, picabia, the, brothers, jacques, villon, raymond, duchamp, villon, and, marcel, duchamp, who, beginning, in, late, 1911, formed, the, core, of, the, section, d, or, or, the, puteaux, group, the, sculptors, alexander, archipenko, joseph, csaky, and, ossip, zadkine, as, well, as, jacques, lipchitz, and, henri, laurens, and, painters, such, as, louis, marcoussis, roger, de, la, fresnaye, franti, ek, kupka, diego, rivera, l, opold, survage, auguste, herbin, andr, lhote, gino, severini, after, 1916, mar, a, blanchard, after, 1916, and, georges, valmier, after, 1918, more, fundamentally, christopher, green, argues, that, douglas, cooper, s, terms, were, later, undermined, by, interpretations, of, the, work, of, picasso, braque, gris, and, l, ger, that, stress, iconographic, and, ideological, questions, rather, than, methods, of, representation, john, berger, identifies, the, essence, of, cubism, with, the, mechanical, diagram, the, metaphorical, model, of, cubism, is, the, diagram, the, diagram, being, a, visible, symbolic, representation, of, invisible, processes, forces, structures, a, diagram, need, not, eschew, certain, aspects, of, appearance, but, these, too, will, be, treated, as, signs, not, as, imitations, or, recreations, there, was, a, distinct, difference, between, kahnweiler, s, cubists, and, the, salon, cubists, prior, to, 1914, picasso, braque, gris, and, l, ger, to, a, lesser, extent, gained, the, support, of, a, single, committed, art, dealer, in, paris, daniel, henry, kahnweiler, who, guaranteed, them, an, annual, income, for, the, exclusive, right, to, buy, their, works, kahnweiler, sold, only, to, a, small, circle, of, connoisseurs, his, support, gave, his, artists, the, freedom, to, experiment, in, relative, privacy, picasso, worked, in, montmartre, until, 1912, while, braque, and, gris, remained, there, until, after, the, first, world, war, l, ger, was, based, in, montparnasse, in, contrast, the, salon, cubists, built, their, reputation, primarily, by, exhibiting, regularly, at, the, salon, d, automne, and, the, salon, des, ind, pendants, both, major, non, academic, salons, in, paris, they, were, inevitably, more, aware, of, public, response, and, the, need, to, communicate, already, in, 1910, a, group, began, to, form, which, included, metzinger, gleizes, delaunay, and, l, ger, they, met, regularly, at, henri, le, fauconnier, s, studio, near, the, boulevard, du, montparnasse, these, soir, es, often, included, writers, such, as, guillaume, apollinaire, and, andr, salmon, together, with, other, young, artists, the, group, wanted, to, emphasise, a, research, into, form, in, opposition, to, the, neo, impressionist, emphasis, on, color, louis, vauxcelles, in, his, review, of, the, 26th, salon, des, ind, pendants, 1910, made, a, passing, and, imprecise, reference, to, metzinger, gleizes, delaunay, l, ger, and, le, fauconnier, as, ignorant, geometers, reducing, the, human, body, the, site, to, pallid, cubes, at, the, 1910, salon, d, automne, a, few, months, later, metzinger, exhibited, his, highly, fractured, nu, la, chemin, e, nude, which, was, subsequently, reproduced, in, both, du, cubisme, 1912, and, les, peintres, cubistes, 1913, the, first, public, controversy, generated, by, cubism, resulted, from, salon, showings, at, the, ind, pendants, during, the, spring, of, 1911, this, showing, by, metzinger, gleizes, delaunay, le, fauconnier, and, l, ger, brought, cubism, to, the, attention, of, the, general, public, for, the, first, time, amongst, the, cubist, works, presented, robert, delaunay, exhibited, his, eiffel, tower, tour, eiffel, solomon, r, guggenheim, museum, new, york, at, the, salon, d, automne, of, the, same, year, in, addition, to, the, ind, pendants, group, of, salle, 41, were, exhibited, works, by, andr, lhote, marcel, duchamp, jacques, villon, roger, de, la, fresnaye, andr, dunoyer, de, segonzac, and, franti, ek, kupka, the, exhibition, was, reviewed, in, the, october, 8, 1911, issue, of, the, new, york, times, this, article, was, published, a, year, after, gelett, burgess, the, wild, men, of, paris, and, two, years, prior, to, the, armory, show, which, introduced, astonished, americans, accustomed, to, realistic, art, to, the, experimental, styles, of, the, european, avant, garde, including, fauvism, cubism, and, futurism, the, 1911, new, york, times, article, portrayed, works, by, picasso, matisse, derain, metzinger, and, others, dated, before, 1909, not, exhibited, at, the, 1911, salon, the, article, was, titled, the, cubists, dominate, paris, fall, salon, and, subtitled, eccentric, school, of, painting, increases, its, vogue, in, the, current, art, exhibition, what, its, followers, attempt, to, do, among, all, the, paintings, on, exhibition, at, the, paris, fall, salon, none, is, attracting, so, much, attention, as, the, extraordinary, productions, of, the, so, called, cubist, school, in, fact, dispatches, from, paris, suggest, these, works, are, easily, the, main, feature, of, the, exhibition, in, spite, of, the, crazy, nature, of, the, cubist, theories, the, number, of, those, professing, them, is, fairly, respectable, georges, braque, andr, derain, picasso, czobel, othon, friesz, herbin, metzinger, these, are, a, few, of, the, names, signed, to, canvases, before, which, paris, has, stood, and, now, again, stands, in, blank, amazement, what, do, they, mean, have, those, responsible, for, them, taken, leave, of, their, senses, is, it, art, or, madness, who, knows, the, subsequent, 1912, salon, des, ind, pendants, located, in, paris, 20, march, to, 16, may, 1912, was, marked, by, the, presentation, of, marcel, duchamp, s, nude, descending, a, staircase, no, 2, which, itself, caused, a, scandal, even, amongst, the, cubists, it, was, in, fact, rejected, by, the, hanging, committee, which, included, his, brothers, and, other, cubists, although, the, work, was, shown, in, the, salon, de, la, section, d, or, in, october, 1912, and, the, 1913, armory, show, in, new, york, duchamp, never, forgave, his, brothers, and, former, colleagues, for, censoring, his, work, juan, gris, a, new, addition, to, the, salon, scene, exhibited, his, portrait, of, picasso, art, institute, of, chicago, while, metzinger, s, two, showings, included, la, femme, au, cheval, woman, with, a, horse, 1911,

artists, jacques, nayral, s, association, with, gleizes, led, him, to, write, the, preface, for, the, cubist, exhibition, which, was, fully, translated, and, reproduced, in, the, newspaper, la, veu, de, catalunya, duchamp, s, nude, descending, a, staircase, no, 2, was, exhibited, for, the, first, time, extensive, media, coverage, in, newspapers, and, magazines, before, during, and, after, the, exhibition, launched, the, galeries, dalmau, as, a, force, in, the, development, and, propagation, of, modernism, in, europe, while, press, coverage, was, extensive, it, was, not, always, positive, articles, were, published, in, the, newspapers, esquella, de, la, torratxa, and, el, noticiero, universal, attacking, the, cubists, with, a, series, of, caricatures, laced, with, derogatory, text, art, historian, jaime, brihuega, writes, of, the, dalmau, show, no, doubt, that, the, exhibition, produced, a, strong, commotion, in, the, public, who, welcomed, it, with, a, lot, of, suspicion, a, major, development, in, cubism, occurred, in, 1912, with, braque, s, and, picasso, s, introduction, of, collage, in, the, modernist, sense, picasso, is, credited, with, creating, the, first, cubist, collage, still, life, with, chair, caning, in, may, 1912, while, braque, preceded, picasso, in, the, creation, of, cubist, cardboard, sculptures, and, papiers, coll, s, papiers, coll, s, were, often, composed, of, pieces, of, everyday, paper, artifacts, such, as, newspaper, table, cloth, wallpaper, and, sheet, music, whereas, cubist, collages, combined, disparate, materials, in, the, case, of, still, life, with, chair, caning, freely, brushed, oil, paint, and, commercially, printed, oilcloth, together, on, a, canvas, the, cubist, contribution, to, the, 1912, salon, d, automne, created, scandal, regarding, the, use, of, government, owned, buildings, such, as, the, grand, palais, to, exhibit, such, artwork, the, indignation, of, the, politician, jean, pierre, philippe, lampu, made, the, front, page, of, le, journal, 5, october, 1912, the, controversy, spread, to, the, municipal, council, of, paris, leading, to, a, debate, in, the, chambre, des, d, put, s, about, the, use, of, public, funds, to, provide, the, venue, for, such, art, the, cubists, were, defended, by, the, socialist, deputy, marcel, sembat, it, was, against, this, background, of, public, anger, that, jean, metzinger, and, albert, gleizes, wrote, du, cubisme, published, by, eug, ne, figui, re, in, 1912, translated, to, english, and, russian, in, 1913, among, the, works, exhibited, were, le, fauconnier, s, vast, composition, les, montagnards, attaqu, s, par, des, ours, mountaineers, attacked, by, bears, now, at, rhode, island, school, of, design, museum, joseph, csaky, s, deux, femme, two, women, a, sculpture, now, lost, in, addition, to, the, highly, abstract, paintings, by, kupka, amorpha, the, national, gallery, prague, and, picabia, la, source, the, spring, museum, of, modern, art, new, york, the, most, extreme, forms, of, cubism, were, not, those, practiced, by, picasso, and, braque, who, resisted, total, abstraction, other, cubists, by, contrast, especially, franti, ek, kupka, and, those, considered, orphists, by, apollinaire, delaunay, l, ger, picabia, and, duchamp, accepted, abstraction, by, removing, visible, subject, matter, entirely, kupka, s, two, entries, at, the, 1912, salon, d, automne, amorpha, fugue, deux, couleurs, and, amorpha, chromatique, chaude, were, highly, abstract, or, nonrepresentational, and, metaphysical, in, orientation, both, duchamp, in, 1912, and, picabia, from, 1912, to, 1914, developed, an, expressive, and, allusive, abstraction, dedicated, to, complex, emotional, and, sexual, themes, beginning, in, 1912, delaunay, painted, a, series, of, paintings, entitled, simultaneous, windows, followed, by, a, series, entitled, formes, circulaires, in, which, he, combined, planar, structures, with, bright, prismatic, hues, based, on, the, optical, characteristics, of, juxtaposed, colors, his, departure, from, reality, in, the, depiction, of, imagery, was, quasi, complete, in, 1913, 14, l, ger, produced, a, series, entitled, contrasts, of, forms, giving, a, similar, stress, to, color, line, and, form, his, cubism, despite, its, abstract, qualities, was, associated, with, themes, of, mechanization, and, modern, life, apollinaire, supported, these, early, developments, of, abstract, cubism, in, les, peintres, cubistes, 1913, writing, of, a, new, pure, painting, in, which, the, subject, was, vacated, but, in, spite, of, his, use, of, the, term, orphism, these, works, were, so, different, that, they, defy, attempts, to, place, them, in, a, single, category, also, labeled, an, orphist, by, apollinaire, marcel, duchamp, was, responsible, for, another, extreme, development, inspired, by, cubism, the, ready, made, arose, from, a, joint, consideration, that, the, work, itself, is, considered, an, object, just, as, a, painting, and, that, it, uses, the, material, detritus, of, the, world, as, collage, and, papier, coll, in, the, cubist, construction, and, assemblage, the, next, logical, step, for, duchamp, was, to, present, an, ordinary, object, as, a, self, sufficient, work, of, art, representing, only, itself, in, 1913, he, attached, a, bicycle, wheel, to, a, kitchen, stool, and, in, 1914, selected, a, bottle, drying, rack, as, a, sculpture, in, its, own, right, the, section, d, or, also, known, as, groupe, de, puteaux, founded, by, some, of, the, most, conspicuous, cubists, was, a, collective, of, painters, sculptors, and, critics, associated, with, cubism, and, orphism, active, from, 1911, through, about, 1914, coming, to, prominence, in, the, wake, of, their, controversial, showing, at, the, 1911, salon, des, ind, pendants, the, salon, de, la, section, d, or, at, the, galerie, la, bo, tie, in, paris, october, 1912, was, arguably, the, most, important, pre, world, war, i, cubist, exhibition, exposing, cubism, to, a, wide, audience, over, 200, works, were, displayed, and, the, fact, that, many, of, the, artists, showed, artworks, representative, of, their, development, from, 1909, to, 1912, gave, the, exhibition, the, allure, of, a, cubist, retrospective, the, group, seems, to, have, adopted, the, name, section, d, or, to, distinguish, themselves, from, the, narrower, definition, of, cubism, developed, in, parallel, by, pablo, picasso, and, georges, braque, in, the, montmartre, quarter, of, paris, and, to, show, that, cubism, rather, than, being, an, isolated, art, form, represented, the, continuation, of, a, grand, tradition, indeed, the, golden, ratio, had, fascinated, western, intellectuals, of, diverse, interests, for, at, least, 2, 400, years, the, idea, of, the, section, d, or, originated, in, the, course, of, conversations, between, metzinger, gleizes, and, jacques, villon, the, group, s, title, was, suggested, by, villon, after, reading, a, 1910, translation, of, leonardo, da, vinci, s, trattato, della, pittura, by, jos, phin, p, ladan, during, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, europeans, were, discovering, african, polynesian, micronesian, and, native, american, art, artists, such, as, paul, gauguin, henri, matisse, and, pablo, picasso, were, intrigued, and, inspired, by, the, stark, power, and, simplicity, of, styles, of, those, foreign, cultures, around, 1906, picasso, met, matisse, through, gertrude, stein, at, a, time, when, both, artists, had, recently, acquired, an, interest, in, primitivism, iberian, sculpture, african, art, and, african, tribal, masks, they, became, friendly, rivals, and, competed, with, each, other, throughout, their, careers, perhaps, leading, to, picasso, entering, a, new, period, in, his, work, by, 1907, marked, by, the, influence, of, greek, iberian, and, african, art, picasso, s, paintings, of, 1907, have, been, characterized, as, protocubism, as, notably, seen, in, les, demoiselles, d, avignon, the, antecedent, of, cubism, art, historian, douglas, cooper, says, paul, gauguin, and, paul, c, zanne, were, particularly, influential, to, the, formation, of, cubism, and, especially, important, to, the, paintings, of, picasso, during, 1906, and, 1907, cooper, goes, on, to, say, the, demoiselles, is, generally, referred, to, as, the, first, cubist, picture, this, is, an, exaggeration, for, although, it, was, a, major, first, step, towards, cubism, it, is, not, yet, cubist, the, disruptive, expressionist, element, in, it, is, even, contrary, to, the, spirit, of, cubism, which, looked, at, the, world, in, a, detached, realistic, spirit, nevertheless, the, demoiselles, is, the, logical, picture, to, take, as, the, starting, point, for, cubism, because, it, marks, the, birth, of, a, new, pictorial, idiom, because, in, it, picasso, violently, overturned, established, conventions, and, because, all, that, followed, grew, out, of, it, the, most, serious, objection, to, regarding, the, demoiselles, as, the, origin, of, cubism, with, its, evident, influence, of, primitive, art, is, that, such, deductions, are, unhistorical, wrote, the, art, historian, daniel, robbins, this, familiar, explanation, fails, to, give, adequate, consideration, to, the, complexities, of, a, flourishing, art, that, existed, just, before, and, during, the, period, when, picasso, s, new, painting, developed, between, 1905, and, 1908, a, conscious, search, for, a, new, style, caused, rapid, changes, in, art, across, france, germany, the, netherlands, italy, and, russia, the, impressionists, had, used, a, double, point, of, view, and, both, les, nabis, and, the, symbolists, who, also, admired, c, zanne, flattened, the, picture, plane, reducing, their, subjects, to, simple, geometric, forms, neo, impressionist, structure, and, subject, matter, most, notably, to, be, seen, in, the, works, of, georges, seurat, e, g, parade, de, cirque, le, chahut, and, le, cirque, was, another, important, influence, there, were, also, parallels, in, the, development, of, literature, and, social, thought, in, addition, to, seurat, the, roots, of, cubism, are, to, be, found, in, the, two, distinct, tendencies, of, c, zanne, s, later, work, first, his, breaking, of, the, painted, surface, into, small, multifaceted, areas, of, paint, thereby, emphasizing, the, plural, viewpoint, given, by, binocular, vision, and, second, his, interest, in, the, simplification, of, natural, forms, into, cylinders, spheres, and, cones, however, the, cubists, explored, this, concept, further, than, c, zanne, they, represented, all, the, surfaces, of, depicted, objects, in, a, single, picture, plane, as, if, the, objects, had, all, their, faces, visible, at, the, same, time, this, new, kind, of, depiction, revolutionized, the, way, objects, could, be, visualized, in, painting, and, art, the, historical, study, of, cubism, began, in, the, late, 1920s, drawing, at, first, from, sources, of, limited, data, namely, the, opinions, of, guillaume, apollinaire, it, came, to, rely, heavily, on, daniel, henry, kahnweiler, s, book, der, weg, zum, kubismus, published, in, 1920, which, centered, on, the, developments, of, picasso, braque, l, ger, and, gris, the, terms, analytical, and, synthetic, which, subsequently, emerged, have, been, widely, accepted, since, the, mid, 1930s, both, terms, are, historical, impositions, that, occurred, after, the, facts, they, identify, neither, phase, was, designated, as, such, at, the, time, corresponding, works, were, created, if, kahnweiler, considers, cubism, as, picasso, and, braque, wrote, daniel, robbins, our, only, fault, is, in, subjecting, other, cubists, works, to, the, rigors, of, that, limited, definition, the, traditional, interpretation, of, cubism, formulated, post, facto, as, a, means, of, understanding, the, works, of, braque, and, picasso, has, affected, our, appreciation, of, other, twentieth, century, artists, it, is, difficult, to, apply, to, painters, such, as, jean, metzinger, albert, gleizes, robert, delaunay, and, henri, le, fauconnier, whose, fundamental, differences, from, traditional, cubism, compelled, kahnweiler, to, question, whether, to, call, them, cubists, at, all, according, to, daniel, robbins, to, suggest, that, merely, because, these, artists, developed, differently, or, varied, from, the, traditional, pattern, they, deserved, to, be, relegated, to, a, secondary, or, satellite, role, in, cubism, is, a, profound, mistake, the, history, of, the, term, cubism, usually, stresses, the, fact, that, matisse, referred, to, cubes, in, connection, with, a, painting, by, braque, in, 1908, and, that, the, term, was, published, twice, by, the, critic, louis, vauxcelles, in, a, similar, context, however, the, word, cube, was, used, in, 1906, by, another, critic, louis, chassevent, with, reference, not, to, picasso, or, braque, but, rather, to, metzinger, and, delaunay, the, critical, use, of, the, word, cube, goes, back, at, least, to, may, 1901, when, jean, b, ral, reviewing, the, work, of, henri, edmond, cross, at, the, ind, pendants, in, art, et, litt, rature, commented, that, he, uses, a, large, and, square, pointillism, giving, the, impression, of, mosaic, one, even, wonders, why, the, artist, has, not, used, cubes, of, solid, matter, diversely, colored, they, would, make, pretty, revetments, robert, herbert, 1968, p, 221, the, term, cubism, did, not, come, into, general, usage, until, 1911, mainly, with, reference, to, metzinger, gleizes, delaunay, and, l, ger, in, 1911, the, poet, and, critic, guillaume, apollinaire, accepted, the, term, on, behalf, of, a, group, of, artists, invited, to, exhibit, at, the, brussels, ind, pendants, the, following, year, in, preparation, for, the, salon, de, la, section, d, or, metzinger, and, gleizes, wrote, and, published, du, cubisme, in, an, effort, to, dispel, the, confusion, raging, around, the, word, and, as, a, major, defence, of, cubism, which, had, caused, a, public, scandal, following, the, 1911, salon, des, ind, pendants, and, the, 1912, salon, d, automne, in, paris, clarifying, their, aims, as, artists, this, work, was, the, first, theoretical, treatise, on, cubism, and, it, still, remains, the, clearest, and, most, intelligible, the, result, not, solely, a, collaboration, between, its, two, authors, reflected, discussions, by, the, circle, of, artists, who, met, in, puteaux, and, courbevoie, it, mirrored, the, attitudes, of, the, artists, of, passy, which, included, picabia, and, the, duchamp, brothers, to, whom, sections, of, it, were, read, prior, to, publication, the, concept, developed, in, du, cubisme, of, observing, a, subject, from, different, points, in, space, and, time, simultaneously, i, e, the, act, of, moving, around, an, object, to, seize, it, from, several, successive, angles, fused, into, a, single, image, multiple, viewpoints, mobile, perspective, simultaneity, or, multiplicity, is, a, generally, recognized, device, used, by, the, cubists, the, 1912, manifesto, du, cubisme, by, metzinger, and, gleizes, was, followed, in, 1913, by, les, peintres, cubistes, a, collection, of, reflections, and, commentaries, by, guillaume, apollinaire, apollinaire, had, been, closely, involved, with, picasso, beginning, in, 1905, and, braque, beginning, in, 1907, but, gave, as, much, attention, to, artists, such, as, metzinger, gleizes, delaunay, picabia, and, duchamp, the, fact, that, the, 1912, exhibition, had, been, curated, to, show, the, successive, stages, through, which, cubism, had, transited, and, that, du, cubisme, had, been, published, for, the, occasion, indicates, the, artists, intention, of, making, their, work, comprehensible, to, a, wide, audience, art, critics, art, collectors, art, dealers, and, the, general, public, undoubtedly, due, to, the, great, success, of, the, exhibition, cubism, became, avant, garde, movement, recognized, as, a, genre, or, style, in, art, with, a, specific, common, philosophy, or, goal, a, significant, modification, of, cubism, between, 1914, and, 1916, was, signaled, by, a, shift, towards, a, strong, emphasis, on, large, overlapping, geometric, planes, and, flat, surface, activity, this, grouping, of, styles, of, painting, and, sculpture, especially, significant, between, 1917, and, 1920, was, practiced, by, several, artists, particularly, those, under, contract, with, the, art, dealer, and, collector, l, once, rosenberg, the, tightening, of, the, compositions, the, clarity, and, sense, of, order, reflected, in, these, works, led, to, its, being, referred, to, by, the, critic, maurice, raynal, as, crystal, cubism, considerations, manifested, by, cubists, prior, to, the, outset, of, world, war, i, such, as, the, fourth, dimension, dynamism, of, modern, life, the, occult, and, henri, bergson, s, concept, of, duration, had, now, been, vacated, replaced, by, a, purely, formal, frame, of, reference, crystal, cubism, and, its, associative, rappel, l, ordre, has, been, linked, with, an, inclination, by, those, who, served, the, armed, forces, and, by, those, who, remained, in, the, civilian, sector, to, escape, the, realities, of, the, great, war, both, during, and, directly, following, the, conflict, the, purifying, of, cubism, from, 1914, through, the, mid, 1920s, with, its, cohesive, unity, and, voluntary, constraints, has, been, linked, to, a, much, broader, ideological, transformation, towards, conservatism, in, both, french, society, and, french, culture, the, most, innovative, period, of, cubism, was, before, 1914, after, world, war, i, with, the, support, given, by, the, dealer, l, once, rosenberg, cubism, returned, as, a, central, issue, for, artists, and, continued, as, such, until, the, mid, 1920s, when, its, avant, garde, status, was, rendered, questionable, by, the, emergence, of, geometric, abstraction, and, surrealism, in, paris, many, cubists, including, picasso, braque, gris, l, ger, gleizes, metzinger, and, emilio, pettoruti, while, developing, other, styles, returned, periodically, to, cubism, even, well, after, 1925, cubism, reemerged, during, the, 1920s, and, the, 1930s, in, the, work, of, the, american, stuart, davis, and, the, englishman, ben, nicholson, in, france, however, cubism, experienced, a, decline, beginning, in, about, 1925, l, once, rosenberg, exhibited, not, only, the, artists, stranded, by, kahnweiler, s, exile, but, others, including, laurens, lipchitz, metzinger, gleizes, csaky, herbin, and, severini, in, 1918, rosenberg, presented, a, series, of, cubist, exhibitions, at, his, galerie, de, l, effort, moderne, in, paris, attempts, were, made, by, louis, vauxcelles, to, argue, that, cubism, was, dead, but, these, exhibitions, along, with, a, well, organized, cubist, show, at, the, 1920, salon, des, ind, pendants, and, a, revival, of, the, salon, de, la, section, d, or, in, the, same, year, demonstrated, it, was, still, alive, the, reemergence, of, cubism, coincided, with, the, appearance, from, about, 1917, to, 1924, of, a, coherent, body, of, theoretical, writing, by, pierre, reverdy, maurice, raynal, and, daniel, henry, kahnweiler, and, among, the, artists, by, gris, l, ger, and, gleizes, the, occasional, return, to, classicism, figurative, work, either, exclusively, or, alongside, cubist, work, experienced, by, many, artists, during, this, period, called, neoclassicism, has, been, linked, to, the, tendency, to, evade, the, realities, of, the, war, and, also, to, the, cultural, dominance, of, a, classical, or, latin, image, of, france, during, and, immediately, following, the, war, cubism, after, 1918, can, be, seen, as, part, of, a, wide, ideological, shift, towards, conservatism, in, both, french, society, and, culture, yet, cubism, itself, remained, evolutionary, both, within, the, oeuvre, of, individual, artists, such, as, gris, and, metzinger, and, across, the, work, of, artists, as, different, from, each, other, as, braque, l, ger, and, gleizes, cubism, as, a, publicly, debated, movement, became, relatively, unified, and, open, to, definition, its, theoretical, purity, made, it, a, gauge, against, which, such, diverse, tendencies, as, realism, or, naturalism, dada, surrealism, and, abstraction, could, be, compared, japan, and, china, were, among, the, first, countries, in, asia, to, be, influenced, by, cubism, contact, first, occurred, via, european, texts, translated, and, published, in, japanese, art, journals, in, the, 1910s, in, the, 1920s, japanese, and, chinese, artists, who, studied, in, paris, for, example, those, enrolled, at, the, cole, nationale, sup, rieure, des, beaux, arts, brought, back, with, them, both, an, understanding, of, modern, art, movements, including, cubism, notable, works, exhibiting, cubist, qualities, were, tetsugor, yorozu, s, self, portrait, with, red, eyes, 1912, and, fang, ganmin, s, melody, in, autumn, 1934, the, cubism, of, picasso, and, braque, had, more, than, a, technical, or, formal, significance, and, the, distinct, attitudes, and, intentions, of, the, salon, cubists, produced, different, kinds, of, cubism, rather, than, a, derivative, of, their, work, it, is, by, no, means, clear, in, any, case, wrote, christopher, green, to, what, extent, these, other, cubists, depended, on, picasso, and, braque, for, their, development, of, such, techniques, as, faceting, passage, and, multiple, perspective, they, could, well, have, arrived, at, such, practices, with, little, knowledge, of, true, cubism, in, its, early, stages, guided, above, all, by, their, own, understanding, of, c, zanne, the, works, exhibited, by, these, cubists, at, the, 1911, and, 1912, salons, extended, beyond, the, conventional, c, zanne, like, subjects, the, posed, model, still, life, and, landscape, favored, by, picasso, and, braque, to, include, large, scale, modern, life, subjects, aimed, at, a, large, public, these, works, stressed, the, use, of, multiple, perspective, and, complex, planar, faceting, for, expressive, effect, while, preserving, the, eloquence, of, subjects, endowed, with, literary, and, philosophical, connotations, in, du, cubisme, metzinger, and, gleizes, explicitly, related, the, sense, of, time, to, multiple, perspective, giving, symbolic, expression, to, the, notion, of, duration, proposed, by, the, philosopher, henri, bergson, according, to, which, life, is, subjectively, experienced, as, a, continuum, with, the, past, flowing, into, the, present, and, the, present, merging, into, the, future, the, salon, cubists, used, the, faceted, treatment, of, solid, and, space, and, effects, of, multiple, viewpoints, to, convey, a, physical, and, psychological, sense, of, the, fluidity, of, consciousness, blurring, the, distinctions, between, past, present, and, future, one, of, the, major, theoretical, innovations, made, by, the, salon, cubists, independently, of, picasso, and, braque, was, that, of, simultaneity, drawing, to, greater, or, lesser, extent, on, theories, of, henri, poincar, ernst, mach, charles, henry, maurice, princet, and, henri, bergson, with, simultaneity, the, concept, of, separate, spatial, and, temporal, dimensions, was, comprehensively, challenged, linear, perspective, developed, during, the, renaissance, was, vacated, the, subject, matter, was, no, longer, considered, from, a, specific, point, of, view, at, a, moment, in, time, but, built, following, a, selection, of, successive, viewpoints, i, e, as, if, viewed, simultaneously, from, numerous, angles, and, in, multiple, dimensions, with, the, eye, free, to, roam, from, one, to, the, other, this, technique, of, representing, simultaneity, multiple, viewpoints, or, relative, motion, is, pushed, to, a, high, degree, of, complexity, in, metzinger, s, nu, la, chemin, e, exhibited, at, the, 1910, salon, d, automne, gleizes, monumental, le, d, piquage, des, moissons, harvest, threshing, exhibited, at, the, 1912, salon, de, la, section, d, or, le, fauconnier, s, abundance, shown, at, the, ind, pendants, of, 1911, and, delaunay, s, city, of, paris, exhibited, at, the, ind, pendants, in, 1912, these, ambitious, works, are, some, of, the, largest, paintings, in, the, history, of, cubism, l, ger, s, the, wedding, also, shown, at, the, salon, des, ind, pendants, in, 1912, gave, form, to, the, notion, of, simultaneity, by, presenting, different, motifs, as, occurring, within, a, single, temporal, frame, where, responses, to, the, past, and, present, interpenetrate, with, collective, force, the, conjunction, of, such, subject, matter, with, simultaneity, aligns, salon, cubism, with, early, futurist, paintings, by, umberto, boccioni, gino, severini, and, carlo, carr, themselves, made, in, response, to, early, cubism, cubism, and, modern, european, art, was, introduced, into, the, united, states, at, the, now, legendary, 1913, armory, show, in, new, york, city, which, then, traveled, to, chicago, and, boston, in, the, armory, show, pablo, picasso, exhibited, la, femme, au, pot, de, moutarde, 1910, the, sculpture, head, of, a, woman, fernande, 1909, 10, les, arbres, 1907, amongst, other, cubist, works, jacques, villon, exhibited, seven, important, and, large, drypoints, while, his, brother, marcel, duchamp, shocked, the, american, public, with, his, painting, nude, descending, a, staircase, no, 2, 1912, francis, picabia, exhibited, his, abstractions, la, danse, la, source, and, la, procession, seville, both, of, 1912, albert, gleizes, exhibited, la, femme, aux, phlox, 1910, and, l, homme, au, balcon, 1912, two, highly, stylized, and, faceted, cubist, works, georges, braque, fernand, l, ger, raymond, duchamp, villon, roger, de, la, fresnaye, and, alexander, archipenko, also, contributed, examples, of, their, cubist, works, just, as, in, painting, cubist, sculpture, is, rooted, in, paul, c, zanne, s, reduction, of, painted, objects, into, component, planes, and, geometric, solids, cubes, spheres, cylinders, and, cones, and, just, as, in, painting, it, became, a, pervasive, influence, and, contributed, fundamentally, to, constructivism, and, futurism, cubist, sculpture, developed, in, parallel, to, cubist, painting, during, the, autumn, of, 1909, picasso, sculpted, head, of, a, woman, fernande, with, positive, features, depicted, by, negative, space, and, vice, versa, according, to, douglas, cooper, the, first, true, cubist, sculpture, was, picasso, s, impressive, woman, s, head, modeled, in, 1909, 10, a, counterpart, in, three, dimensions, to, many, similar, analytical, and, faceted, heads, in, his, paintings, at, the, time, these, positive, negative, reversals, were, ambitiously, exploited, by, alexander, archipenko, in, 1912, 13, for, example, in, woman, walking, joseph, csaky, after, archipenko, was, the, first, sculptor, in, paris, to, join, the, cubists, with, whom, he, exhibited, from, 1911, onwards, they, were, followed, by, raymond, duchamp, villon, and, then, in, 1914, by, jacques, lipchitz, henri, laurens, and, ossip, zadkine, indeed, cubist, construction, was, as, influential, as, any, pictorial, cubist, innovation, it, was, the, stimulus, behind, the, proto, constructivist, work, of, both, naum, gabo, and, vladimir, tatlin, and, thus, the, starting, point, for, the, entire, constructive, tendency, in, 20th, century, modernist, sculpture, cubism, formed, an, important, link, between, early, 20th, century, art, and, architecture, the, historical, theoretical, and, socio, political, relationships, between, avant, garde, practices, in, painting, sculpture, and, architecture, had, early, ramifications, in, france, germany, the, netherlands, and, czechoslovakia, though, there, are, many, points, of, intersection, between, cubism, and, architecture, only, a, few, direct, links, between, them, can, be, drawn, most, often, the, connections, are, made, by, reference, to, shared, formal, characteristics, faceting, of, form, spatial, ambiguity, transparency, and, multiplicity, architectural, interest, in, cubism, centered, on, the, dissolution, and, reconstitution, of, three, dimensional, form, using, simple, geometric, shapes, juxtaposed, without, the, illusions, of, classical, perspective, diverse, elements, could, be, superimposed, made, transparent, or, penetrate, one, another, while, retaining, their, spatial, relationships, cubism, had, become, an, influential, factor, in, the, development, of, modern, architecture, from, 1912, la, maison, cubiste, by, raymond, duchamp, villon, and, andr, mare, onwards, developing, in, parallel, with, architects, such, as, peter, behrens, and, walter, gropius, with, the, simplification, of, building, design, the, use, of, materials, appropriate, to, industrial, production, and, the, increased, use, of, glass, cubism, was, relevant, to, an, architecture, seeking, a, style, that, needed, not, refer, to, the, past, thus, what, had, become, a, revolution, in, both, painting, and, sculpture, was, applied, as, part, of, a, profound, reorientation, towards, a, changed, world, the, cubo, futurist, ideas, of, filippo, tommaso, marinetti, influenced, attitudes, in, avant, garde, architecture, the, influential, de, stijl, movement, embraced, the, aesthetic, principles, of, neo, plasticism, developed, by, piet, mondrian, under, the, influence, of, cubism, in, paris, de, stijl, was, also, linked, by, gino, severini, to, cubist, theory, through, the, writings, of, albert, gleizes, however, the, linking, of, basic, geometric, forms, with, inherent, beauty, and, ease, of, industrial, application, which, had, been, prefigured, by, marcel, duchamp, from, 1914, was, left, to, the, founders, of, purism, am, d, e, ozenfant, and, charles, douard, jeanneret, better, known, as, le, corbusier, who, exhibited, paintings, together, in, paris, and, published, apr, s, le, cubisme, in, 1918, le, corbusier, s, ambition, had, been, to, translate, the, properties, of, his, own, style, of, cubism, to, architecture, between, 1918, and, 1922, le, corbusier, concentrated, his, efforts, on, purist, theory, and, painting, in, 1922, le, corbusier, and, his, cousin, jeanneret, opened, a, studio, in, paris, at, 35, rue, de, s, vres, his, theoretical, studies, soon, advanced, into, many, different, architectural, projects, at, the, 1912, salon, d, automne, an, architectural, installation, was, exhibited, that, quickly, became, known, as, maison, cubiste, cubist, house, with, architecture, by, raymond, duchamp, villon, and, interior, decoration, by, andr, mare, along, with, a, group, of, collaborators, metzinger, and, gleizes, in, du, cubisme, written, during, the, assemblage, of, the, maison, cubiste, wrote, about, the, autonomous, nature, of, art, stressing, the, point, that, decorative, considerations, should, not, govern, the, spirit, of, art, decorative, work, to, them, was, the, antithesis, of, the, picture, the, true, picture, wrote, metzinger, and, gleizes, bears, its, raison, d, tre, within, itself, it, can, be, moved, from, a, church, to, a, drawing, room, from, a, museum, to, a, study, essentially, independent, necessarily, complete, it, need, not, immediately, satisfy, the, mind, on, the, contrary, it, should, lead, it, little, by, little, towards, the, fictitious, depths, in, which, the, coordinative, light, resides, it, does, not, harmonize, with, this, or, that, ensemble, it, harmonizes, with, things, in, general, with, the, universe, it, is, an, organism, la, maison, cubiste, was, a, fully, furnished, model, house, with, a, facade, a, staircase, wrought, iron, banisters, and, two, rooms, a, living, room, the, salon, bourgeois, where, paintings, by, marcel, duchamp, metzinger, woman, with, a, fan, gleizes, laurencin, and, l, ger, were, hung, and, a, bedroom, it, was, an, example, of, l, art, d, coratif, a, home, within, which, cubist, art, could, be, displayed, in, the, comfort, and, style, of, modern, bourgeois, life, spectators, at, the, salon, d, automne, passed, through, the, plaster, facade, designed, by, duchamp, villon, to, the, two, furnished, rooms, this, architectural, installation, was,

entitled, facade, architectural, plaster, fa, ade, architecturale, the, furnishings, wallpaper, upholstery, and, carpets, of, the, interior, were, designed, by, andr, mare, and, were, early, examples,

frames, for, cubist, works, because, they, allowed, paintings, and, sculptures, their, independence, christopher, green, wrote, creating, a, play, of, contrasts, hence, the, involvement, not, only, of, gleizes, and, metzinger, themselves, but, of, marie, laurencin, the, duchamp, brothers, raymond, duchamp, villon, designed, the, facade, and, mare, s, old, friends, l, ger, and, roger, la,

most, part, between, 1910, and, 1914, but, the, cubist, or, cubism, influenced, buildings, were, also, built, after, world, war, i, after, the, war, the, architectural, style, called, rondo, cubism, was, developed, in, prague, fusing, the, cubist, architecture, with, round, shapes, in, their, theoretical, rules, the, cubist, architects, expressed, the, requirement, of, dynamism, which, would, surmount, the, matter, and, calm, contained, in, it, through, a, creative, idea, so, that, the, result, would, evoke, feelings, of, dynamism, and, expressive, plasticity, in, the, viewer, this, should, be, achieved, by, shapes, derived, from, pyramids, cubes, and, prisms, by, arrangements, and, compositions, of, oblique, surfaces, mainly, triangular, sculpted, facades, in, protruding, crystal, like, units, reminiscent, of, the, so, called, diamond, cut, or, even, cavernous, that, are, reminiscent, of, the, late, gothic, architecture, in, this, way, the, entire, surfaces, of, the,
