sees, him, more, as, the, liberator, of, english, hymnody, because, his, hymns, and, hymns, like, them, moved, worshippers, beyond, singing, only, old, testament, psalms, inspiring, congregations, and, revitalizing, worship, later, writers, took, even, more, freedom, some, even, including, allegory, and, metaphor, in, their, texts, charles, wesley, s, hymns, spread, methodist, theology, not, only, within, methodism, but, in, most, protestant, churches, he, developed, a, new, focus, expressing, one, s, personal, feelings, in, the, relationship, with, god, as, well, as, the, simple, worship, seen, in, older, hymns, wesley, s, contribution, along, with, the, second, great, awakening, in, america, led, to, a, new, style, called, gospel, and, a, new, explosion, of, sacred, music,

churches, which, rely, exclusively, on, traditional, chants, a, type, of, hymn, the, methodist, revival, of, the, 18th, century, created, an, explosion, of, hymn, writing, in, welsh, which, continued, into, the, first, half, of, the, 19th, century, the, most, prominent, names, among, welsh, hymn, writers, are, william, williams, pantycelyn, and, ann, griffiths, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, witnessed, an, explosion, of, hymn, tune, composition, and, congregational, four, part, singing, in, wales, along, with, the, more, classical, sacred, music, of, composers, ranging, from, charpentier, 19, hymns, h, 53, h, 71, to, mozart, to, monteverdi, the, catholic, church, continued, to, produce, many, popular, hymns, such, as, lead, kindly, light, silent, night, o, sacrament, most,

styles, often, influenced, by, popular, music, this, often, leads, to, some, conflict, between, older, and, younger, congregants, see, contemporary, worship, this, is, not, new, the, christian, pop, music, style, began, in, the, late, 1960s, and, became, very, popular, during, the, 1970s, as, young, hymnists, sought, ways, in, which, to, make, the, music, of, their, religion, relevant, for, their, generation, this, long, tradition, has, resulted, in, a, wide, variety, of, hymns, some, modern, churches, include, within, hymnody, the, traditional, hymn, usually, describing, god, contemporary, worship, music, often, directed, to, god, and, gospel, music, expressions, of, one, s, personal, experience, of, god, this, distinction, is, not, perfectly, clear, and, purists, remove, the, second, two, types, from, the, classification, as, hymns, it, is, a, matter, of, debate, even, sometimes, within, a, single, congregation, often, between, revivalist, and, traditionalist, movements, swedish, composer, and, musicologist, elisabet, wentz, janacek, mapped, 20, 000, melody, variants, for, swedish, hymns, and, helped, create, the, swedish, choral, registrar, which,

were, used, during, church, services, during, this, era, of, publishing, thomas, symmes, a, clergyman, of, the, third, generation, of, puritans, in, new, england, spread, throughout, churches, a, new, idea, of, how, to, sing, hymns, in, which, anyone, could, sing, a, hymn, any, way, they, felt, led, to, this, idea, was, opposed, by, a, writer, of, the, time, rev, thomas, walter, who, felt, it, was, like, five, hundred, different, tunes, roared, out, at, the, same, time, william, billings, a, singing, school, teacher, created, the, first, tune, book, with, only, american, born, compositions, within, his, books, billings, did, not, put, as, much, emphasis, on, common, measure, a, quatrain, that, rhymes, abab, and, alternates, four, stress, and, three, stress, iambic, lines, which, was, the, typical, way, hymns, were, sung, noting, in, his, preface, the, fondness, of, other, compilers, for, tunes, in, common, measure, billings, promised, his, subscribers, a, well, balanced, collection, with, a, sufficiency, in, each, measure, and, indeed, the, singing, master, s, assistant, has, many, tunes, whose, declamation, is, based, on, the, dactyl, in, duple, time, boston, s,

and, dwight, l, moody, developed, the, relatively, new, subcategory, of, gospel, hymns, earlier, in, the, 19th, century, the, use, of, musical, notation, especially, shape, notes, exploded, in, america, and, professional, singing, masters, went, from, town, to, town, teaching, the, population, how, to, sing, from, sight, instead, of, the, more, common, lining, out, that, had, been, used, before, that, during, this, period, hundreds, of, tune, books, were, published, including, b, f, white, s, sacred, harp, and, earlier, works, like, the, missouri, harmony, kentucky, harmony, hesperian, harp, d, h, mansfield, s, the, american, vocalist, the, social, harp, the, southern, harmony, william, walker, s, christian, harmony, jeremiah, ingalls, christian, harmony, and, literally, many, dozens, of, others, shape, notes, were, important, in, the, spread, of, then, more, modern, singing, styles, with, tenor, led, 4, part, harmony, based, on, older, english, west, gallery, music, fuging, sections, anthems, and, other, more, complex, features, during, this, period, hymns, were, incredibly, popular, in, the, united, states, and, one, or, more, of, the, above, mentioned, tunebooks, could, be, found, in, almost, every, household, it, is, not, uncommon, to, hear, accounts, of, young, people, and, teenagers, gathering, together, to, spend, an, afternoon, singing, hymns, and, anthems, from, tune, books, which, was, considered, great, fun, and, there, are, surviving, accounts, of, abraham, lincoln, and, his, sweetheart, singing, together, from, the, missouri, harmony, during, his, youth, by, the, 1860s, musical, reformers, like, lowell, mason, the, so, called, better, music, boys, were, actively, campaigning, for, the, introduction, of, more, refined, and, modern, singing, styles, and, eventually, these, american, tune, books, were, replaced, in, many, churches, starting, in, the, northeast, and, urban, areas, and, spreading, out, into, the, countryside, as, people, adopted, the, gentler, more, soothing, tones, of, victorian, hymnody, and, even, adopted, dedicated, trained, choirs, to, do, their, church, s, singing, rather, than, having, the, entire, congregation, participate, but, in, many, rural, areas, the, old, traditions, lived, on, not, in, churches, but, in, weekly, monthly, or, annual, conventions, were, people, would, meet, to, sing, from, their, favorite, tunebooks, the, most, popular, one, and, the, only, one, that, survived, continuously, in, print, was, the, sacred, harp, which, could, be, found, in, the, typical, rural, southern, home, right, up, until, the, living, tradition, was, re, discovered, by, alan, lomax, in, the, 1960s, although, it, had, been, well, documented, by, musicologist, george, pullen, jackson, prior, to, this, since, then, there, has, been, a, renaissance, in, sacred, harp, singing, with, annual, conventions, popping, up, in, all, 50, states, and, in, a, number, of, european, countries,
