impressionism, was, a, 19th, century, art, movement, characterized, by, relatively, small, thin, yet, visible, brush, strokes, open, composition, emphasis, on, accurate, depiction, of, light, in, its, changing, qualities, often, accentuating, the, effects, of, the, passage, of, time, ordinary, subject, matter, unusual, visual, angles, and, inclusion, of, movement, as, a, crucial, element, of, human, perception, and, experience, impressionism, originated, with, a, group, of, paris, based, artists, whose, independent, exhibitions, brought, them, to, prominence, during, the, 1870s, and, 1880s, the, impressionists, faced, harsh, opposition, from, the, conventional, art, community, in, france, the, name, of, the, style, derives, from, the, title, of, a, claude, monet, work, impression, soleil, levant, impression, sunrise, which, provoked, the, critic, louis, leroy, to, coin, the, term, in, a, satirical, 1874, review, of, the, first, impressionist, exhibition, published, in, the, parisian, newspaper, le, charivari, the, development, of, impressionism, in, the, visual, arts, was, soon, followed, by, analogous, styles, in, other, media, that, became, known, as, impressionist, music, and, impressionist, literature, radicals, in, their, time, the, early, impressionists, violated, the, rules, of, academic, painting, they, constructed, their, pictures, from, freely, brushed, colours, that, took, precedence, over, lines, and, contours, following, the, example, of, painters, such, as, eug, ne, delacroix, and, j, m, w, turner, they, also, painted, realistic, scenes, of, modern, life, and, often, painted, outdoors, previously, still, lifes, and, portraits, as, well, as, landscapes, were, usually, painted, in, a, studio, the, impressionists, found, that, they, could, capture, the, momentary, and, transient, effects, of, sunlight, by, painting, outdoors, or, en, plein, air, they, portrayed, overall, visual, effects, instead, of, details, and, used, short, broken, brush, strokes, of, mixed, and, pure, unmixed, colour, not, blended, smoothly, or, shaded, as, was, customary, to, achieve, an, effect, of, intense, colour, vibration, impressionism, emerged, in, france, at, the, same, time, that, a, number, of, other, painters, including, the, italian, artists, known, as, the, macchiaioli, and, winslow, homer, in, the, united, states, were, also, exploring, plein, air, painting, the, impressionists, however, developed, new, techniques, specific, to, the, style, encompassing, what, its, adherents, argued, was, a, different, way, of, seeing, it, is, an, art, of, immediacy, and, movement, of, candid, poses, and, compositions, of, the, play, of, light, expressed, in, a, bright, and, varied, use, of, colour, in, 1876, the, poet, and, critic, st, phane, mallarm, said, of, the, new, style, the, represented, subject, being, composed, of, a, harmony, of, reflected, and, ever, changing, lights, cannot, be, supposed, always, to, look, the, same, but, palpitates, with, movement, light, and, life, the, public, at, first, hostile, gradually, came, to, believe, that, the, impressionists, had, captured, a, fresh, and, original, vision, even, if, the, art, critics, and, art, establishment, disapproved, of, the, new, style, by, recreating, the, sensation, in, the, eye, that, views, the, subject, rather, than, delineating, the, details, of, the, subject, and, by, creating, a, welter, of, techniques, and, forms, impressionism, is, a, precursor, of, various, painting, styles, including, neo, impressionism, post, impressionism, fauvism, and, cubism, in, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, a, time, of, rapid, industrialization, and, unsettling, social, change, in, france, as, emperor, napoleon, iii, rebuilt, paris, and, waged, war, the, acad, mie, des, beaux, arts, dominated, french, art, the, acad, mie, was, the, preserver, of, traditional, french, painting, standards, of, content, and, style, historical, subjects, religious, themes, and, portraits, were, valued, landscape, and, still, life, were, not, the, acad, mie, preferred, carefully, finished, images, that, looked, realistic, when, examined, closely, paintings, in, this, style, were, made, up, of, precise, brush, strokes, carefully, blended, to, hide, the, artist, s, hand, in, the, work, colour, was, restrained, and, often, toned, down, further, by, the, application, of, a, thick, golden, varnish, the, acad, mie, had, an, annual, juried, art, show, the, salon, de, paris, and, artists, whose, work, was, displayed, in, the, show, won, prizes, garnered, commissions, and, enhanced, their, prestige, the, standards, of, the, juries, represented, the, values, of, the, acad, mie, represented, by, the, works, of, such, artists, as, jean, l, on, g, r, me, and, alexandre, cabanel, using, an, eclectic, mix, of, techniques, and, formulas, established, in, western, painting, since, the, renaissance, such, as, linear, perspective, and, figure, types, derived, from, classical, greek, art, these, artists, produced, escapist, visions, of, a, reassuringly, ordered, world, by, the, 1850s, some, artists, notably, the, realist, painter, gustave, courbet, had, gained, public, attention, and, critical, censure, by, depicting, contemporary, realities, without, the, idealization, demanded, by, the, acad, mie, in, the, early, 1860s, four, young, painters, claude, monet, pierre, auguste, renoir, alfred, sisley, and, fr, d, ric, bazille, met, while, studying, under, the, academic, artist, charles, gleyre, they, discovered, that, they, shared, an, interest, in, painting, landscape, and, contemporary, life, rather, than, historical, or, mythological, scenes, following, a, practice, pioneered, by, artists, such, as, the, englishman, john, constable, that, had, become, increasingly, popular, by, mid, century, they, often, ventured, into, the, countryside, together, to, paint, in, the, open, air, their, purpose, was, not, to, make, sketches, to, be, developed, into, carefully, finished, works, in, the, studio, as, was, the, usual, custom, but, to, complete, their, paintings, out, of, doors, by, painting, in, sunlight, directly, from, nature, and, making, bold, use, of, the, vivid, synthetic, pigments, that, had, become, available, since, the, beginning, of, the, century, they, began, to, develop, a, lighter, and, brighter, manner, of, painting, that, extended, further, the, realism, of, courbet, and, the, barbizon, school, a, favourite, meeting, place, for, the, artists, was, the, caf, guerbois, on, avenue, de, clichy, in, paris, where, the, discussions, were, often, led, by, douard, manet, whom, the, younger, artists, greatly, admired, they, were, soon, joined, by, camille, pissarro, paul, c, zanne, and, armand, guillaumin, during, the, 1860s, the, salon, jury, routinely, rejected, about, half, of, the, works, submitted, by, monet, and, his, friends, in, favour, of, works, by, artists, faithful, to, the, approved, style, in, 1863, the, salon, jury, rejected, manet, s, the, luncheon, on, the, grass, le, d, jeuner, sur, l, herbe, primarily, because, it, depicted, a, nude, woman, with, two, clothed, men, at, a, picnic, while, the, salon, jury, routinely, accepted, nudes, in, historical, and, allegorical, paintings, they, condemned, manet, for, placing, a, realistic, nude, in, a, contemporary, setting, the, jury, s, severely, worded, rejection, of, manet, s, painting, appalled, his, admirers, and, the, unusually, large, number, of, rejected, works, that, year, perturbed, many, french, artists, after, emperor, napoleon, iii, saw, the, rejected, works, of, 1863, he, decreed, that, the, public, be, allowed, to, judge, the, work, themselves, and, the, salon, des, refus, s, salon, of, the, refused, was, organized, while, many, viewers, came, only, to, laugh, the, salon, des, refus, s, drew, attention, to, the, existence, of, a, new, tendency, in, art, and, attracted, more, visitors, than, the, regular, salon, artists, petitions, requesting, a, new, salon, des, refus, s, in, 1867, and, again, in, 1872, were, denied, in, december, 1873, monet, renoir, pissarro, sisley, c, zanne, berthe, morisot, edgar, degas, and, several, other, artists, founded, the, soci, t, anonyme, des, artistes, peintres, sculpteurs, graveurs, etc, to, exhibit, their, artworks, independently, members, of, the, association, were, expected, to, forswear, participation, in, the, salon, the, organizers, invited, a, number, of, other, progressive, artists, to, join, them, in, their, inaugural, exhibition, including, the, older, eug, ne, boudin, whose, example, had, first, persuaded, monet, to, adopt, plein, air, painting, years, before, another, painter, who, greatly, influenced, monet, and, his, friends, johan, jongkind, declined, to, participate, as, did, douard, manet, in, total, thirty, artists, participated, in, their, first, exhibition, held, in, april, 1874, at, the, studio, of, the, photographer, nadar, the, critical, response, was, mixed, monet, and, c, zanne, received, the, harshest, attacks, critic, and, humorist, louis, leroy, wrote, a, scathing, review, in, the, newspaper, le, charivari, in, which, making, wordplay, with, the, title, of, claude, monet, s, impression, sunrise, impression, soleil, levant, he, gave, the, artists, the, name, by, which, they, became, known, derisively, titling, his, article, the, exhibition, of, the, impressionists, leroy, declared, that, monet, s, painting, was, at, most, a, sketch, and, could, hardly, be, termed, a, finished, work, he, wrote, in, the, form, of, a, dialogue, between, viewers, impression, i, was, certain, of, it, i, was, just, telling, myself, that, since, i, was, impressed, there, had, to, be, some, impression, in, it, and, what, freedom, what, ease, of, workmanship, wallpaper, in, its, embryonic, state, is, more, finished, than, that, seascape, the, term, impressionist, quickly, gained, favour, with, the, public, it, was, also, accepted, by, the, artists, themselves, even, though, they, were, a, diverse, group, in, style, and, temperament, unified, primarily, by, their, spirit, of, independence, and, rebellion, they, exhibited, together, albeit, with, shifting, membership, eight, times, between, 1874, and, 1886, the, impressionists, style, with, its, loose, spontaneous, brushstrokes, would, soon, become, synonymous, with, modern, life, monet, sisley, morisot, and, pissarro, may, be, considered, the, purest, impressionists, in, their, consistent, pursuit, of, an, art, of, spontaneity, sunlight, and, colour, degas, rejected, much, of, this, as, he, believed, in, the, primacy, of, drawing, over, colour, and, belittled, the, practice, of, painting, outdoors, renoir, turned, away, from, impressionism, for, a, time, during, the, 1880s, and, never, entirely, regained, his, commitment, to, its, ideas, douard, manet, although, regarded, by, the, impressionists, as, their, leader, never, abandoned, his, liberal, use, of, black, as, a, colour, while, impressionists, avoided, its, use, and, preferred, to, obtain, darker, colours, by, mixing, and, never, participated, in, the, impressionist, exhibitions, he, continued, to, submit, his, works, to, the, salon, where, his, painting, spanish, singer, had, won, a, 2nd, class, medal, in, 1861, and, he, urged, the, others, to, do, likewise, arguing, that, the, salon, is, the, real, field, of, battle, where, a, reputation, could, be, made, among, the, artists, of, the, core, group, minus, bazille, who, had, died, in, the, franco, prussian, war, in, 1870, defections, occurred, as, c, zanne, followed, later, by, renoir, sisley, and, monet, abstained, from, the, group, exhibitions, so, they, could, submit, their, works, to, the, salon, disagreements, arose, from, issues, such, as, guillaumin, s, membership, in, the, group, championed, by, pissarro, and, c, zanne, against, opposition, from, monet, and, degas, who, thought, him, unworthy, degas, invited, mary, cassatt, to, display, her, work, in, the, 1879, exhibition, but, also, insisted, on, the, inclusion, of, jean, fran, ois, raffa, lli, ludovic, lepic, and, other, realists, who, did, not, represent, impressionist, practices, causing, monet, in, 1880, to, accuse, the, impressionists, of, opening, doors, to, first, come, daubers, in, this, regard, the, seventh, paris, impressionist, exhibition, in, 1882, was, the, most, selective, of, all, including, the, works, of, only, nine, true, impressionists, namely, gustave, caillebotte, paul, gauguin, armand, guillaumin, claude, monet, berthe, morisot, camille, pissarro, pierre, auguste, renoir, alfred, sisley, and, victor, vignon, the, group, then, divided, again, over, the, invitations, to, paul, signac, and, georges, seurat, to, exhibit, with, them, at, the, 8th, impressionist, exhibition, in, 1886, pissarro, was, the, only, artist, to, show, at, all, eight, paris, impressionist, exhibitions, the, individual, artists, achieved, few, financial, rewards, from, the, impressionist, exhibitions, but, their, art, gradually, won, a, degree, of, public, acceptance, and, support, their, dealer, durand, ruel, played, a, major, role, in, this, as, he, kept, their, work, before, the, public, and, arranged, shows, for, them, in, london, and, new, york, although, sisley, died, in, poverty, in, 1899, renoir, had, a, great, salon, success, in, 1879, monet, became, secure, financially, during, the, early, 1880s, and, so, did, pissarro, by, the, early, 1890s, by, this, time, the, methods, of, impressionist, painting, in, a, diluted, form, had, become, commonplace, in, salon, art, french, painters, who, prepared, the, way, for, impressionism, include, the, romantic, colourist, eug, ne, delacroix, the, leader, of, the, realists, gustave, courbet, and, painters, of, the, barbizon, school, such, as, th, odore, rousseau, the, impressionists, learned, much, from, the, work, of, johan, barthold, jongkind, jean, baptiste, camille, corot, and, eug, ne, boudin, who, painted, from, nature, in, a, direct, and, spontaneous, style, that, prefigured, impressionism, and, who, befriended, and, advised, the, younger, artists, a, number, of, identifiable, techniques, and, working, habits, contributed, to, the, innovative, style, of, the, impressionists, although, these, methods, had, been, used, by, previous, artists, and, are, often, conspicuous, in, the, work, of, artists, such, as, frans, hals, diego, vel, zquez, peter, paul, rubens, john, constable, and, j, m, w, turner, the, impressionists, were, the, first, to, use, them, all, together, and, with, such, consistency, these, techniques, include, new, technology, played, a, role, in, the, development, of, the, style, impressionists, took, advantage, of, the, mid, century, introduction, of, premixed, paints, in, tin, tubes, resembling, modern, toothpaste, tubes, which, allowed, artists, to, work, more, spontaneously, both, outdoors, and, indoors, previously, painters, made, their, own, paints, individually, by, grinding, and, mixing, dry, pigment, powders, with, linseed, oil, which, were, then, stored, in, animal, bladders, many, vivid, synthetic, pigments, became, commercially, available, to, artists, for, the, first, time, during, the, 19th, century, these, included, cobalt, blue, viridian, cadmium, yellow, and, synthetic, ultramarine, blue, all, of, which, were, in, use, by, the, 1840s, before, impressionism, the, impressionists, manner, of, painting, made, bold, use, of, these, pigments, and, of, even, newer, colours, such, as, cerulean, blue, which, became, commercially, available, to, artists, in, the, 1860s, the, impressionists, progress, toward, a, brighter, style, of, painting, was, gradual, during, the, 1860s, monet, and, renoir, sometimes, painted, on, canvases, prepared, with, the, traditional, red, brown, or, grey, ground, by, the, 1870s, monet, renoir, and, pissarro, usually, chose, to, paint, on, grounds, of, a, lighter, grey, or, beige, colour, which, functioned, as, a, middle, tone, in, the, finished, painting, by, the, 1880s, some, of, the, impressionists, had, come, to, prefer, white, or, slightly, off, white, grounds, and, no, longer, allowed, the, ground, colour, a, significant, role, in, the, finished, painting, the, impressionists, reacted, to, modernity, by, exploring, a, wide, range, of, non, academic, subjects, in, art, such, as, middle, class, leisure, activities, and, urban, themes, including, train, stations, caf, s, brothels, the, theater, and, dance, they, found, inspiration, in, the, newly, widened, avenues, of, paris, bounded, by, new, tall, buildings, that, offered, opportunities, to, depict, bustling, crowds, popular, entertainments, and, nocturnal, lighting, in, artificially, closed, off, spaces, a, painting, such, as, caillebotte, s, paris, street, rainy, day, 1877, strikes, a, modern, note, by, emphasizing, the, isolation, of, individuals, amid, the, outsized, buildings, and, spaces, of, the, urban, environment, when, painting, landscapes, the, impressionists, did, not, hesitate, to, include, the, factories, that, were, proliferating, in, the, countryside, earlier, painters, of, landscapes, had, conventionally, avoided, smokestacks, and, other, signs, of, industrialization, regarding, them, as, blights, on, nature, s, order, and, unworthy, of, art, prior, to, the, impressionists, other, painters, notably, such, 17th, century, dutch, painters, as, jan, steen, had, emphasized, common, subjects, but, their, methods, of, composition, were, traditional, they, arranged, their, compositions, so, that, the, main, subject, commanded, the, viewer, s, attention, j, m, w, turner, while, an, artist, of, the, romantic, era, anticipated, the, style, of, impressionism, with, his, artwork, the, impressionists, relaxed, the, boundary, between, subject, and, background, so, that, the, effect, of, an, impressionist, painting, often, resembles, a, snapshot, a, part, of, a, larger, reality, captured, as, if, by, chance, photography, was, gaining, popularity, and, as, cameras, became, more, portable, photographs, became, more, candid, photography, inspired, impressionists, to, represent, momentary, action, not, only, in, the, fleeting, lights, of, a, landscape, but, in, the, day, to, day, lives, of, people, the, development, of, impressionism, can, be, considered, partly, as, a, reaction, by, artists, to, the, challenge, presented, by, photography, which, seemed, to, devalue, the, artist, s, skill, in, reproducing, reality, both, portrait, and, landscape, paintings, were, deemed, somewhat, deficient, and, lacking, in, truth, as, photography, produced, lifelike, images, much, more, efficiently, and, reliably, in, spite, of, this, photography, actually, inspired, artists, to, pursue, other, means, of, creative, expression, and, rather, than, compete, with, photography, to, emulate, reality, artists, focused, on, the, one, thing, they, could, inevitably, do, better, than, the, photograph, by, further, developing, into, an, art, form, its, very, subjectivity, in, the, conception, of, the, image, the, very, subjectivity, that, photography, eliminated, the, impressionists, sought, to, express, their, perceptions, of, nature, rather, than, create, exact, representations, this, allowed, artists, to, depict, subjectively, what, they, saw, with, their, tacit, imperatives, of, taste, and, conscience, photography, encouraged, painters, to, exploit, aspects, of, the, painting, medium, like, colour, which, photography, then, lacked, the, impressionists, were, the, first, to, consciously, offer, a, subjective, alternative, to, the, photograph, another, major, influence, was, japanese, ukiyo, e, art, prints, japonism, the, art, of, these, prints, contributed, significantly, to, the, snapshot, angles, and, unconventional, compositions, that, became, characteristic, of, impressionism, an, example, is, monet, s, jardin, sainte, adresse, 1867, with, its, bold, blocks, of, colour, and, composition, on, a, strong, diagonal, slant, showing, the, influence, of, japanese, prints, edgar, degas, was, both, an, avid, photographer, and, a, collector, of, japanese, prints, his, the, dance, class, la, classe, de, danse, of, 1874, shows, both, influences, in, its, asymmetrical, composition, the, dancers, are, seemingly, caught, off, guard, in, various, awkward, poses, leaving, an, expanse, of, empty, floor, space, in, the, lower, right, quadrant, he, also, captured, his, dancers, in, sculpture, such, as, the, little, dancer, of, fourteen, years, impressionists, in, varying, degrees, were, looking, for, ways, to, depict, visual, experience, and, contemporary, subjects, female, impressionists, were, interested, in, these, same, ideals, but, had, many, social, and, career, limitations, compared, to, male, impressionists, they, were, particularly, excluded, from, the, imagery, of, the, bourgeois, social, sphere, of, the, boulevard, cafe, and, dance, hall, as, well, as, imagery, women, were, excluded, from, the, formative, discussions, that, resulted, in, meetings, in, those, places, that, was, where, male, impressionists, were, able, to, form, and, share, ideas, about, impressionism, in, the, academic, realm, women, were, believed, to, be, incapable, of, handling, complex, subjects, which, led, teachers, to, restrict, what, they, taught, female, students, it, was, also, considered, unladylike, to, excel, in, art, since, women, s, true, talents, were, then, believed, to, center, on, homemaking, and, mothering, yet, several, women, were, able, to, find, success, during, their, lifetime, even, though, their, careers, were, affected, by, personal, circumstances, bracquemond, for, example, had, a, husband, who, was, resentful, of, her, work, which, caused, her, to, give, up, painting, the, four, most, well, known, namely, mary, cassatt, eva, gonzal, s, marie, bracquemond, and, berthe, morisot, are, and, were, often, referred, to, as, the, women, impressionists, their, participation, in, the, series, of, eight, impressionist, exhibitions, that, took, place, in, paris, from, 1874, to, 1886, varied, morisot, participated, in, seven, cassatt, in, four, bracquemond, in, three, and, gonzal, s, did, not, participate, the, critics, of, the, time, lumped, these, four, together, without, regard, to, their, personal, styles, techniques, or, subject, matter, critics, viewing, their, works, at, the, exhibitions, often, attempted, to, acknowledge, the, women, artists, talents, but, circumscribed, them, within, a, limited, notion, of, femininity, arguing, for, the, suitability, of, impressionist, technique, to, women, s, manner, of, perception, parisian, critic, s, c, de, soissons, wrote, one, can, understand, that, women, have, no, originality, of, thought, and, that, literature, and, music, have, no, feminine, character, but, surely, women, know, how, to, observe, and, what, they, see, is, quite, different, from, that, which, men, see, and, the, art, which, they, put, in, their, gestures, in, their, toilet, in, the, decoration, of, their, environment, is, sufficient, to, give, is, the, idea, of, an, instinctive, of, a, peculiar, genius, which, resides, in, each, one, of, them, while, impressionism, legitimized, the, domestic, social, life, as, subject, matter, of, which, women, had, intimate, knowledge, it, also, tended, to, limit, them, to, that, subject, matter, portrayals, of, often, identifiable, sitters, in, domestic, settings, which, could, offer, commissions, were, dominant, in, the, exhibitions, the, subjects, of, the, paintings, were, often, women, interacting, with, their, environment, by, either, their, gaze, or, movement, cassatt, in, particular, was, aware, of, her, placement, of, subjects, she, kept, her, predominantly, female, figures, from, objectification, and, cliche, when, they, are, not, reading, they, converse, sew, drink, tea, and, when, they, are, inactive, they, seem, lost, in, thought, the, women, impressionists, like, their, male, counterparts, were, striving, for, truth, for, new, ways, of, seeing, and, new, painting, techniques, each, artist, had, an, individual, painting, style, women, impressionists, particularly, morisot, and, cassatt, were, conscious, of, the, balance, of, power, between, women, and, objects, in, their, paintings, the, bourgeois, women, depicted, are, not, defined, by, decorative, objects, but, instead, interact, with, and, dominate, the, things, with, which, they, live, there, are, many, similarities, in, their, depictions, of, women, who, seem, both, at, ease, and, subtly, confined, gonzal, s, box, at, the, italian, opera, depicts, a, woman, staring, into, the, distance, at, ease, in, a, social, sphere, but, confined, by, the, box, and, the, man, standing, next, to, her, cassatt, s, painting, young, girl, at, a, window, is, brighter, in, color, but, remains, constrained, by, the, canvas, edge, as, she, looks, out, the, window, despite, their, success, in, their, ability, to, have, a, career, and, impressionism, s, demise, attributed, to, its, allegedly, feminine, characteristics, its, sensuality, dependence, on, sensation, physicality, and, fluidity, the, four, women, artists, and, other, lesser, known, women, impressionists, were, largely, omitted, from, art, historical, textbooks, covering, impressionist, artists, until, tamar, garb, s, women, impressionists, published, in, 1986, for, example, impressionism, by, jean, leymarie, published, in, 1955, included, no, information, on, any, women, impressionists, painter, androniqi, zengo, antoniu, is, co, credited, with, the, introduction, of, impressionism, to, albania, the, central, figures, in, the, development, of, impressionism, in, france, listed, alphabetically, were, the, impressionists, among, the, close, associates, of, the, impressionists, victor, vignon, is, the, only, artist, outside, the, group, of, prominent, names, who, participated, to, the, most, exclusive, seventh, paris, impressionist, exhibition, in, 1882, which, was, indeed, a, rejection, to, the, previous, less, restricted, exhibitions, chiefly, organized, by, degas, originally, from, the, school, of, corot, vignon, was, a, friend, of, camille, pissarro, whose, influence, is, evident, in, his, impressionist, style, after, the, late, 1870s, and, a, friend, of, post, impressionist, vincent, van, gogh, there, were, several, other, close, associates, of, the, impressionists, who, adopted, their, methods, to, some, degree, these, include, jean, louis, forain, who, participated, in, impressionist, exhibitions, in, 1879, 1880, 1881, and, 1886, and, giuseppe, de, nittis, an, italian, artist, living, in, paris, who, participated, in, the, first, impressionist, exhibit, at, the, invitation, of, degas, although, the, other, impressionists, disparaged, his, work, federico, zandomeneghi, was, another, italian, friend, of, degas, who, showed, with, the, impressionists, eva, gonzal, s, was, a, follower, of, manet, who, did, not, exhibit, with, the, group, james, abbott, mcneill, whistler, was, an, american, born, painter, who, played, a, part, in, impressionism, although, he, did, not, join, the, group, and, preferred, grayed, colours, walter, sickert, an, english, artist, was, initially, a, follower, of, whistler, and, later, an, important, disciple, of, degas, he, did, not, exhibit, with, the, impressionists, in, 1904, the, artist, and, writer, wynford, dewhurst, wrote, the, first, important, study, of, the, french, painters, published, in, english, impressionist, painting, its, genesis, and, development, which, did, much, to, popularize, impressionism, in, great, britain, by, the, early, 1880s, impressionist, methods, were, affecting, at, least, superficially, the, art, of, the, salon, fashionable, painters, such, as, jean, b, raud, and, henri, gervex, found, critical, and, financial, success, by, brightening, their, palettes, while, retaining, the, smooth, finish, expected, of, salon, art, works, by, these, artists, are, sometimes, casually, referred, to, as, impressionism, despite, their, remoteness, from, impressionist, practice, the, influence, of, the, french, impressionists, lasted, long, after, most, of, them, had, died, artists, like, j, d, kirszenbaum, were, borrowing, impressionist, techniques, throughout, the, twentieth, century, as, the, influence, of, impressionism, spread, beyond, france, artists, too, numerous, to, list, became, identified, as, practitioners, of, the, new, style, some, of, the, more, important, examples, are, while, edgar, degas, was, primarily, known, as, a, painter, in, his, lifetime, he, began, to, pursue, the, medium, of, sculpture, later, in, his, artistic, career, in, the, 1880s, he, created, as, many, as, 150, sculptures, during, his, lifetime, degas, preferred, the, medium, of, wax, for, his, sculptures, because, it, allowed, him, to, make, changes, start, over, and, further, explore, the, modelling, process, only, one, of, degas, s, sculptures, little, dancer, of, fourteen, years, was, exhibited, in, his, lifetime, which, was, exhibited, at, the, sixth, impressionist, exhibition, in, 1881, little, dancer, proved, to, be, controversial, with, critics, some, considered, degas, to, have, overthrown, sculptural, traditions, in, the, same, way, that, impressionism, had, overthrown, the, traditions, of, painting, others, found, it, to, be, ugly, following, the, degas, s, death, in, 1917, his, heirs, authorized, bronze, castings, from, 73, of, the, artist, s, sculptures, the, sculptor, auguste, rodin, is, sometimes, called, an, impressionist, for, the, way, he, used, roughly, modeled, surfaces, to, suggest, transient, light, effects, the, sculptor, medardo, rosso, has, also, been, called, an, impressionist, some, russian, artists, created, impressionistic, sculptures, of, animals, in, order, to, break, away, from, old, world, concepts, their, works, have, been, described, as, endowing, birds, and, beasts, with, new, spiritual, characteristics, while, his, photographs, are, less, known, than, his, paintings, or, his, sculptures, edgar, degas, also, pursued, photography, later, in, his, life, his, photographs, were, never, exhibited, during, his, lifetime, and, not, much, attention, was, given, to, them, following, his, death, it, was, not, until, the, late, 20th, century, that, scholars, started, to, take, interest, in, degas, s, photographs, pictorialist, photographers, whose, work, is, characterized, by, soft, focus, and, atmospheric, effects, have, also, been, called, impressionists, these, impressionist, photographers, used, various, techniques, such, as, photographing, subjects, out, of, focus, using, soft, focus, lenses, or, pinhole, lenses, and, manipulating, the, gum, bichromate, process, to, create, images, that, resembled, impressionist, paintings, french, impressionist, cinema, is, a, term, applied, to, a, loosely, defined, group, of, films, and, filmmakers, in, france, from, 1919, to, 1929, although, these, years, are, debatable, french, impressionist, filmmakers, include, abel, gance, jean, epstein, germaine, dulac, marcel, l, herbier, louis, delluc, and, dmitry, kirsanoff, musical, impressionism, is, the, name, given, to, a, movement, in, european, classical, music, that, arose, in, the, late, 19th, century, and, continued, into, the, middle, of, the, 20th, century, originating, in, france, musical, impressionism, is, characterized, by, suggestion, and, atmosphere, and, eschews, the, emotional, excesses, of, the, romantic, era, impressionist, composers, favoured, short, forms, such, as, the, nocturne, arabesque, and, prelude, and, often, explored, uncommon, scales, such, as, the, whole, tone, scale, perhaps, the, most, notable, innovations, of, impressionist, composers, were, the, introduction, of, major, 7th, chords, and, the, extension, of, chord, structures, in, 3rds, to, five, and, six, part, harmonies, the, influence, of, visual, impressionism, on, its, musical, counterpart, is, debatable, claude, debussy, and, maurice, ravel, are, generally, considered, the, greatest, impressionist, composers, but, debussy, disavowed, the, term, calling, it, the, invention, of, critics, erik, satie, was, also, considered, in, this, category, though, his, approach, was, regarded, as, less, serious, more, musical, novelty, in, nature, paul, dukas, is, another, french, composer, sometimes, considered, an, impressionist, but, his, style, is, perhaps, more, closely, aligned, to, the, late, romanticists, musical, impressionism, beyond, france, includes, the, work, of, such, composers, as, ottorino, respighi, italy, ralph, vaughan, williams, cyril, scott, and, john, ireland, england, manuel, de, falla, and, isaac, albeniz, spain, and, charles, griffes, america, american, impressionist, music, differs, from, european, impressionist, music, and, these, differences, are, mainly, reflected, in, charles, griffith, s, poetry, of, flute, and, orchestral, music, he, is, also, the, most, prolific, impressionist, composer, in, the, united, states, the, term, impressionism, has, also, been, used, to, describe, works, of, literature, in, which, a, few, select, details, suffice, to, convey, the, sensory, impressions, of, an, incident, or, scene, impressionist, literature, is, closely, related, to, symbolism, with, its, major, exemplars, being, baudelaire, mallarm, rimbaud, and, verlaine, authors, such, as, virginia, woolf, d, h, lawrence, henry, james, and, joseph, conrad, have, written, works, that, are, impressionistic, in, the, way, that, they, describe, rather, than, interpret, the, impressions, sensations, and, emotions, that, constitute, a, character, s, mental, life, some, literary, scholars, such, as, john, g, peters, believe, literary, impressionism, is, better, defined, by, its, philosophical, stance, than, by, any, supposed, relationship, with, impressionist, painting, during, the, 1880s, several, artists, began, to, develop, different, precepts, for, the, use, of, colour, pattern, form, and, line, derived, from, the, impressionist, example, vincent, van, gogh, paul, gauguin, georges, seurat, and, henri, de, toulouse, lautrec, these, artists, were, slightly, younger, than, the, impressionists, and, their, work, is, known, as, post, impressionism, post, impressionist, artists, reacted, against, the, impressionists, concern, with, realistically, reproducing, the, optical, sensations, of, light, and, colour, they, turned, instead, toward, symbolic, content, and, the, expression, of, emotion, post, impressionism, prefigured, the, characteristics, of, futurism, and, cubism, reflecting, the, change, of, attitude, towards, art, in, european, society, some, of, the, original, impressionist, artists, also, ventured, into, this, new, territory, camille, pissarro, briefly, painted, in, a, pointillist, manner, and, even, monet, abandoned, strict, plein, air, painting, paul, c, zanne, who, participated, in, the, first, and, third, impressionist, exhibitions, developed, a, highly, individual, vision, emphasising, pictorial, structure, and, he, is, more, often, called, a, post, impressionist, although, these, cases, illustrate, the, difficulty, of, assigning, labels, the, work, of, the, original, impressionist, painters, may, by, definition, be, categorised, as, impressionism, general
