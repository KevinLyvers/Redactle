ancient, jewish, manuscripts, from, the, second, temple, period, they, were, discovered, over, a, period, of, 10, years, between, 1946, and, 1956, at, the, qumran, caves, near, ein, feshkha, in, the, west, bank, on, the, northern, shore, of, the, dead, sea, dating, from, the, 3rd, century, bce, to, the, 1st, century, ce, the, dead, sea, scrolls, include, the, oldest, surviving, manuscripts, of, entire, books, later, included, in, the, biblical, canons, along, with, extra, biblical, and, deuterocanonical, manuscripts, from, late, second, temple, judaism, at, the, same, time, they, cast, new, light, on, the, emergence, of, christianity, and, of, rabbinic, judaism, almost, all, of, the, 15, 000, scrolls, and, scroll, fragments, are, held, in, the, shrine, of, the, book, at, the, israel, museum, located, in, the, city, of, jerusalem, the, israeli, government, s, custody, of, the, dead, sea, scrolls, is, disputed, by, jordan, and, the, palestinian, authority, on, territorial, legal, and, humanitarian, grounds, they, were, mostly, discovered, following, the, jordanian, annexation, of, the, west, bank, and, were, acquired, by, israel, after, jordan, lost, the, 1967, arab, israeli, war, whilst, israel, s, claims, are, primarily, based, on, historical, and, religious, grounds, given, their, significance, in, jewish, history, and, in, the, heritage, of, judaism, many, thousands, of, written, fragments, have, been, discovered, in, the, dead, sea, area, they, represent, the, remnants, of, larger, manuscripts, damaged, by, natural, causes, or, through, human, interference, with, the, vast, majority, holding, only, small, scraps, of, text, however, a, small, number, of, well, preserved, and, near, intact, manuscripts, have, survived, fewer, than, a, dozen, among, those, from, the, qumran, caves, researchers, have, assembled, a, collection, of, 981, different, manuscripts, discovered, in, 1946, 1947, and, in, 1956, from, 11, caves, which, lie, in, the, immediate, vicinity, of, the, hellenistic, jewish, settlement, at, the, site, of, khirbet, qumran, in, the, eastern, judaean, desert, in, the, west, bank, the, caves, are, located, about, 1, 5, kilometres, 1, mi, west, of, the, northwestern, shore, of, the, dead, sea, whence, they, derive, their, name, archaeologists, have, long, associated, the, scrolls, with, the, ancient, jewish, sect, known, as, the, essenes, although, some, recent, interpretations, have, challenged, this, connection, and, argue, that, priests, in, jerusalem, or, zadokites, or, other, unknown, jewish, groups, wrote, the, scrolls, most, of, the, manuscripts, are, written, in, hebrew, with, some, written, in, aramaic, for, example, the, son, of, god, text, in, different, regional, dialects, including, nabataean, and, a, few, in, greek, discoveries, from, the, judaean, desert, add, latin, from, masada, and, arabic, from, khirbet, al, mird, most, of, the, texts, are, written, on, parchment, some, on, papyrus, and, one, on, copper, though, scholarly, consensus, dates, the, dead, sea, scrolls, to, between, the, 3rd, century, bce, and, the, 1st, century, ce, there, are, manuscripts, from, associated, judaean, desert, sites, that, are, dated, to, as, early, as, the, 8th, century, bce, and, as, late, as, the, 11th, century, ce, bronze, coins, found, at, the, same, sites, form, a, series, beginning, with, john, hyrcanus, a, ruler, of, the, hasmonean, kingdom, in, office, 135, 104, bce, and, continuing, until, the, period, of, the, first, jewish, roman, war, 66, 73, ce, supporting, the, paleography, and, radiocarbon, dating, of, the, scrolls, owing, to, the, poor, condition, of, some, of, the, scrolls, scholars, have, not, identified, all, of, their, texts, the, identified, texts, fall, into, three, general, groups, the, dead, sea, scrolls, were, discovered, in, a, series, of, 12, caves, around, the, site, originally, known, as, ein, feshkha, near, the, dead, sea, in, the, west, bank, then, controlled, by, jordan, between, 1946, and, 1956, by, bedouin, shepherds, and, a, team, of, archaeologists, the, practice, of, storing, worn, out, sacred, manuscripts, in, earthenware, vessels, buried, in, the, earth, or, within, caves, is, related, to, the, ancient, jewish, custom, of, genizah, the, initial, discovery, by, bedouin, shepherd, muhammed, edh, dhib, his, cousin, jum, a, muhammed, and, khalil, musa, took, place, between, november, 1946, and, february, 1947, the, shepherds, discovered, seven, scrolls, see, the, caves, and, their, scrolls, and, fragments, housed, in, jars, in, a, cave, near, what, is, now, known, as, the, qumran, site, john, c, trever, reconstructed, the, story, of, the, scrolls, from, several, interviews, with, the, bedouin, edh, dhib, s, cousin, noticed, the, caves, but, edh, dhib, himself, was, the, first, to, actually, fall, into, one, the, cave, now, called, cave, 1, he, retrieved, a, handful, of, scrolls, which, trever, identifies, as, the, isaiah, scroll, habakkuk, commentary, and, the, community, rule, and, took, them, back, to, the, camp, to, show, to, his, family, none, of, the, scrolls, were, destroyed, in, this, process, the, bedouin, kept, the, scrolls, hanging, on, a, tent, pole, while, they, contemplated, what, they, should, do, with, them, periodically, showing, the, scrolls, to, their, people, at, some, point, during, this, time, the, community, rule, was, split, in, two, the, bedouin, first, took, the, scrolls, to, a, dealer, named, ibrahim, ijha, in, bethlehem, ijha, returned, them, saying, they, were, worthless, after, being, warned, that, they, might, have, been, stolen, from, a, synagogue, undaunted, the, bedouin, went, to, a, nearby, market, where, a, syrian, christian, offered, to, buy, them, a, sheikh, joined, their, conversation, and, suggested, that, they, take, the, scrolls, to, khalil, eskander, shahin, kando, a, cobbler, and, part, time, antiques, dealer, the, bedouin, and, the, dealers, returned, to, the, site, leaving, one, scroll, with, kando, and, selling, three, others, to, a, dealer, for, seven, jordanian, pounds, approximately, 28, or, 382, in, 2023, dollars, the, original, scrolls, continued, to, change, hands, after, the, bedouin, left, them, in, the, possession, of, a, third, party, until, a, sale, could, be, arranged, see, ownership, in, 1947, the, original, seven, scrolls, caught, the, attention, of, john, c, trever, of, the, american, schools, of, oriental, research, asor, who, compared, the, script, in, the, scrolls, to, that, of, the, nash, papyrus, the, oldest, biblical, manuscript, then, known, and, found, similarities, between, them, in, march, the, 1948, arab, israeli, war, prompted, the, move, of, some, of, the, scrolls, to, beirut, lebanon, for, safekeeping, on, 11, april, 1948, millar, burrows, head, of, the, asor, announced, the, discovery, of, the, scrolls, in, a, general, press, release, early, in, september, 1948, metropolitan, bishop, mar, samuel, brought, some, additional, scroll, fragments, that, he, had, acquired, to, professor, ovid, r, sellers, the, new, director, of, asor, by, the, end, of, 1948, nearly, two, years, after, the, discovery, of, the, scrolls, scholars, had, yet, to, locate, the, original, cave, where, the, fragments, had, been, found, with, unrest, in, the, country, at, that, time, no, large, scale, search, could, be, safely, undertaken, sellers, tried, to, persuade, the, syrians, to, assist, in, the, search, for, the, cave, but, he, was, unable, to, pay, their, price, in, early, 1949, the, government, of, jordan, granted, permission, to, the, arab, legion, to, search, the, area, in, which, the, original, qumran, cave, was, believed, to, exist, consequently, cave, 1, was, rediscovered, on, 28, january, 1949, by, belgian, united, nations, observer, captain, phillipe, lippens, and, arab, legion, captain, akkash, el, zebn, the, rediscovery, of, what, became, known, as, cave, 1, at, qumran, prompted, the, initial, excavation, of, the, site, from, 15, february, to, 5, march, 1949, by, the, jordanian, department, of, antiquities, led, by, gerald, lankester, harding, and, roland, de, vaux, 9, the, cave, 1, site, yielded, discoveries, of, additional, dead, sea, scroll, fragments, linen, cloth, jars, and, other, artefacts, in, november, 1951, roland, de, vaux, and, his, team, from, the, asor, began, a, full, excavation, of, qumran, by, february, 1952, the, bedouin, had, discovered, 30, fragments, in, what, was, to, be, designated, cave, 2, the, discovery, of, a, second, cave, eventually, yielded, 300, fragments, from, 33, manuscripts, including, fragments, of, jubilees, and, the, wisdom, of, sirach, written, in, hebrew, the, following, month, on, 14, march, 1952, the, asor, team, discovered, a, third, cave, with, fragments, of, jubilees, and, the, copper, scroll, between, september, and, december, 1952, the, fragments, and, scrolls, of, caves, 4, 5, and, 6, were, discovered, by, the, asor, teams, with, the, monetary, value, of, the, scrolls, rising, as, their, historical, significance, was, made, more, public, the, bedouins, and, the, asor, archaeologists, accelerated, their, search, for, the, scrolls, separately, in, the, same, general, area, of, qumran, which, was, more, than, one, kilometre, in, length, between, 1953, and, 1956, de, vaux, led, four, more, archaeological, expeditions, in, the, area, to, uncover, scrolls, and, artefacts, cave, 11, was, discovered, in, 1956, and, yielded, the, last, fragments, to, be, found, in, the, vicinity, of, qumran, caves, 4, 10, are, clustered, in, an, area, lying, in, relative, proximity, 150, m, 160, yd, from, khirbet, qumran, while, caves, 1, 2, 3, and, 11, are, located, 1, mile, 1, 2, kilometres, north, with, cave, 3, the, most, remote, in, february, 2017, hebrew, university, archaeologists, announced, the, discovery, of, a, new, 12th, cave, there, was, one, blank, parchment, found, in, a, jar, but, broken, and, empty, scroll, jars, and, pickaxes, suggest, that, the, cave, was, looted, in, the, 1950s, in, march, 2021, israeli, archaeologists, announced, the, discovery, of, dozens, of, fragments, bearing, biblical, text, written, in, greek, from, the, books, of, zechariah, and, nahum, this, group, of, findings, is, believed, to, have, been, hidden, in, a, cave, between, 132, and, 136, ce, during, the, bar, kokhba, revolt, however, a, 10, 500, year, old, basket, made, of, woven, reeds, was, also, discovered, in, the, muraba, at, caves, in, the, nahal, darga, reserve, other, discoveries, included, the, remains, of, a, child, wrapped, in, cloth, dated, to, around, 6, 000, years, ago, and, a, cache, of, coins, from, the, days, of, the, bar, kochba, revolt, in, 2021, more, scrolls, were, discovered, by, israeli, authorities, in, a, different, cave, near, the, dead, sea, called, the, cave, of, horror, the, 972, manuscripts, found, at, qumran, were, found, primarily, in, two, separate, formats, as, scrolls, and, as, fragments, of, previous, scrolls, and, texts, in, the, fourth, cave, the, fragments, were, torn, into, up, to, 15, 000, pieces, these, small, fragments, created, somewhat, of, a, problem, for, scholars, g, l, harding, director, of, the, jordanian, department, of, antiquities, began, working, on, piecing, the, fragments, together, but, did, not, finish, this, before, his, death, in, 1979, wadi, qumran, cave, 1, was, discovered, for, the, first, time, in, 1946, the, initial, discovery, by, bedouin, shepherd, muhammed, edh, dhib, his, cousin, jum, a, muhammed, and, khalil, musa, took, place, between, november, 1946, and, february, 1947, the, shepherds, discovered, seven, scrolls, housed, in, jars, in, a, cave, near, what, is, now, known, as, the, qumran, site, and, took, them, back, to, the, camp, to, show, to, his, family, none, of, the, scrolls, were, destroyed, in, this, process, the, original, seven, dead, sea, scrolls, from, cave, 1, at,

was, discovered, in, february, 1952, and, soon, the, bedouin, people, discovered, 30, fragments, in, it, the, cave, eventually, yielded, 300, fragments, from, 33, manuscripts, of, dead, sea, scrolls, including, fragments, of, jubilees, and, the, wisdom, of, sirach, written, in, hebrew, wadi, qumran, cave, 3, was, discovered, on, 14, march, 1952, by, the, asor, team, the, cave, initially, yielded, fragments, of, jubilees, and, the, copper, scroll, 10, 11, wadi, qumran, cave, 4, was, discovered, in, august, 1952, and, was, excavated, from, 22, 29, september, 1952, by, gerald, lankester, harding, roland, de, vaux, and, j, zef, milik, 10, 11, cave, 4, is, actually, two, hand, cut, caves, 4a, and, 4b, but, since, the, fragments, were, mixed, they, are, labelled, as, 4q, cave, 4, is, the, most, famous, of, qumran, caves, both, because, of, its, visibility, from, the, qumran, plateau, and, its, productivity, it, is, visible, from, the, plateau, to, the, south, of, the, qumran, settlement, it, is, by, far, the, most, productive, of, all, qumran, caves, producing, ninety, per, cent, of, the, dead, sea, scrolls, and, scroll, fragments, approx, 15, 000, fragments, from, 500, different, texts, including, 9, 10, copies, of, jubilees, along, with, 21, tefillin, and, 7, mezuzot, wadi, qumran, cave, 5, was, discovered, alongside, cave, 6, in, 1952, shortly, after, the, discovery, of, cave, 4, cave, 5, produced, approximately, 25, manuscripts, wadi, qumran, cave, 6, was, discovered, alongside, cave, 5, in, 1952, shortly, after, the, discovery, of, cave, 4, cave, 6, contained, fragments, of, about, 31, manuscripts, wadi, qumran, cave, 7, yielded, fewer, than, 20, fragments, of, greek, documents, including, 7q2, the, letter, of, jeremiah, baruch, 6, 7q5, which, became, the, subject, of, much, speculation, in, later, decades, and, a, greek, copy, of, a, scroll, of, enoch, cave, 7, also, produced, several, inscribed, potsherds, and, jars, 104, 109, wadi, qumran, cave, 8, along, with, caves, 7, and, 9, was, one, of, the, only, caves, that, are, accessible, by, passing, through, the, settlement, at, qumran, carved, into, the, southern, end, of, the, qumran, plateau, cave, 8, was, excavated, by, archaeologists, in, 1957, cave, 8, produced, five, fragments, genesis, 8qgen, psalms, 8qps, a, tefillin, fragment, 8qphyl, a, mezuzah, 8qmez, and, a, hymn, 8qhymn, cave, 8, also, produced, several, tefillin, cases, a, box, of, leather, objects, tons, of, lamps, jars, and, the, sole, of, a, leather, shoe, wadi, qumran, cave, 9, along, with, caves, 7, and, 8, was, one, of, the, only, caves, that, are, accessible, by, passing, through, the, settlement, at, qumran, carved, into, the, southern, end, of, the, qumran, plateau, cave, 9, was, excavated, by, archaeologists, in, 1957, there, was, only, one, manuscript, fragment, found, in, cave, 9, in, qumran, cave, 10, archaeologists, found, two, ostraca, with, writing, on, them, along, with, an, unknown, symbol, on, a, grey, stone, slab, wadi, qumran, cave, 11, was, discovered, in, 1956, and, yielded, 21, texts, of, the, dead, sea, scrolls, some, of, which, were, quite, lengthy, the, temple, scroll, so, called, because, more, than, half, of, it, pertains, to, the, construction, of, the, temple, of, jerusalem, was, found, in, cave, 11, and, is, by, far, the, longest, scroll, it, is, now, 26, 7, feet, 8, 15, m, long, its, original, length, may, have, been, over, 28, feet, 8, 75, m, the, temple, scroll, was, regarded, by, scholar, yigael, yadin, as, the, torah, according, to, the, essenes, on, the, other, hand, hartmut, stegemann, a, contemporary, and, friend, of, yadin, believed, the, scroll, was, not, to, be, regarded, as, such, but, was, a, document, without, exceptional, significance, stegemann, notes, that, it, is, not, mentioned, or, cited, in, any, known, essene, writing, also, in, cave, 11, an, eschatological, fragment, about, the, biblical, figure, melchizedek, 11q13, was, found, cave, 11, also, produced, a, copy, of, jubilees, and, a, proto, masoteric, text, of, the, torah, scroll, only, a, fragment, of, the, book, of, leviticus, surviving, known, as, the, paleo, hebrew, leviticus, scroll, according, to, former, chief, editor, of, the, dss, editorial, team, john, strugnell, there, are, at, least, four, privately, owned, scrolls, from, cave, 11, that, have, not, yet, been, made, available, for, scholars, among, them, is, a, complete, aramaic, manuscript, of, the, book, of, enoch, cave, 12, was, discovered, in, february, 2017, on, cliffs, west, of, qumran, near, the, north, western, shore, of, the, dead, sea, archaeological, examination, found, pickaxes, and, empty, broken, scroll, jars, indicating, that, the, cave, had, been, discovered, and, looted, in, the, 1950s, one, of, the, joint, hebrew, university, of, jerusalem, and, liberty, university, of, virginia, project, s, lead, researchers, oren, gutfeld, stated, although, at, the, end, of, the, day, no, scroll, was, found, and, instead, we, only, found, a, piece, of, parchment, rolled, up, in, a, jug, that, was, being, processed, for, writing, the, findings, indicate, beyond, any, doubt, that, the, cave, contained, scrolls, that, were, stolen, some, fragments, of, scrolls, have, neither, significant, archaeological, provenance, nor, records, that, reveal, in, which, designated, qumran, cave, area, they, were, found, they, are, believed, to, have, come, from, wadi, qumran, caves, but, are, just, as, likely, to, have, come, from, other, archaeological, sites, in, the, judaean, desert, area, these, fragments, have, therefore, been, designated, to, the, temporary, x, series, there, has, been, much, debate, about, the, origin, of, the, dead, sea, scrolls, the, dominant, theory, remains, that, the, scrolls, were, produced, by, the, essenes, a, sect, of, jews, living, at, nearby, qumran, but, this, theory, has, come, to, be, challenged, by, several, modern, scholars, the, view, among, scholars, almost, universally, held, until, the, 1990s, is, the, qumran, essene, hypothesis, originally, posited, by, roland, gu, rin, de, vaux, and, j, zef, tadeusz, milik, though, independently, both, eliezer, sukenik, and, butrus, sowmy, of, st, mark, s, monastery, connected, scrolls, with, the, essenes, well, before, any, excavations, at, qumran, the, qumran, essene, theory, holds, that, the, scrolls, were, written, by, the, essenes, or, by, another, jewish, sectarian, group, residing, at, khirbet, qumran, they, composed, the, scrolls, and, ultimately, hid, them, in, the, nearby, caves, during, the, jewish, revolt, sometime, between, 66, and, 68, ce, the, site, of, qumran, was, destroyed, and, the, scrolls, never, recovered, a, number, of, arguments, are, used, to, support, this, theory, qumran, sectarian, theories, are, variations, on, the, qumran, essene, theory, the, main, point, of, departure, from, the, qumran, essene, theory, is, hesitation, to, link, the, dead, sea, scrolls, specifically, with, the, essenes, most, proponents, of, the, qumran, sectarian, theory, understand, a, group, of, jews, living, in, or, near, qumran, to, be, responsible, for, the, dead, sea, scrolls, but, do, not, necessarily, conclude, that, the, sectarians, are, essenes, a, specific, variation, on, the, qumran, sectarian, theory, emerged, in, the, 1990s, that, has, gained, much, recent, popularity, is, the, work, of, lawrence, h, schiffman, who, proposes, that, the, community, was, led, by, a, group, of, zadokite, priests, sadducees, the, most, important, document, in, support, of, this, view, is, the, miqsat, ma, ase, ha, torah, 4qmmt, which, cites, purity, laws, such, as, the, transfer, of, impurities, identical, to, those, attributed, in, rabbinic, writings, to, the, sadducees, 4qmmt, also, reproduces, a, festival, calendar, that, follows, sadducee, principles, for, the, dating, of, certain, festival, days, spanish, jesuit, jos, o, callaghan, mart, nez, argued, in, the, 1960s, that, one, fragment, 7q5, preserves, a, portion, of, text, from, the, new, testament, gospel, of, mark, 6, 52, 53, this, theory, was, scrutinized, in, the, year, 2000, by, paleographic, analysis, of, the, particular, fragment, however, this, faced, some, contention, and, o, callaghan, s, theory, remains, an, area, of, great, dispute, later, analyses, in, 2004, and, 2018, lent, credence, to, o, callaghan, s, original, assertion, robert, eisenman, has, advanced, the, theory, that, some, scrolls, describe, the, early, christian, community, eisenman, also, argued, that, the, careers, of, james, the, just, and, paul, the, apostle, correspond, to, events, recorded, in, some, of, these, documents, some, scholars, have, argued, that, the, scrolls, were, the, product, of, jews, living, in, jerusalem, who, hid, the, scrolls, in, the, caves, near, qumran, while, fleeing, from, the, romans, during, the, destruction, of, jerusalem, in, 70, ce, karl, heinrich, rengstorf, first, proposed, in, the, 1960s, that, the, dead, sea, scrolls, originated, at, the, library, of, the, jewish, temple, in, jerusalem, later, norman, golb, suggested, that, the, scrolls, were, the, product, of, multiple, libraries, in, jerusalem, and, not, necessarily, the, jerusalem, temple, library, proponents, of, the, jerusalem, origin, theory, point, to, the, diversity, of, thought, and, handwriting, among, the, scrolls, as, evidence, against, a, qumran, origin, of, the, scrolls, several, archaeologists, have, also, accepted, an, origin, of, the, scrolls, other, than, qumran, including, yizhar, hirschfeld, and, more, recently, yizhak, magen, and, yuval, peleg, who, all, understand, the, remains, of, qumran, to, be, those, of, a, hasmonean, fort, that, was, reused, during, later, periods, parchment, from, a, number, of, the, dead, sea, scrolls, has, been, carbon, dated, the, initial, test, performed, in, 1950, was, on, a, piece, of, linen, from, one, of, the, caves, this, test, gave, an, indicative, dating, of, 33, ce, plus, or, minus, 200, years, eliminating, early, hypotheses, relating, the, scrolls, to, the, medieval, period, since, then, two, large, series, of, tests, have, been, performed, on, the, scrolls, themselves, the, results, were, summarized, by, vanderkam, and, flint, who, said, the, tests, give, strong, reason, for, thinking, that, most, of, the, qumran, manuscripts, belong, to, the, last, two, centuries, bce, and, the, first, century, ce, 32, analysis, of, letter, forms, or, palaeography, was, applied, to, the, texts, of, the, dead, sea, scrolls, by, a, variety, of, scholars, in, the, field, major, linguistic, analysis, by, cross, and, avigad, dates, fragments, from, 225, bce, to, 50, ce, these, dates, were, determined, by, examining, the, size, variability, and, style, of, the, text, the, same, fragments, were, later, analysed, using, radiocarbon, dating, and, were, dated, to, an, estimated, range, of, 385, bce, to, 82, ce, with, a, 68, accuracy, rate, the, scrolls, were, analysed, using, a, cyclotron, at, the, university, of, california, davis, where, it, was, found, that, all, black, ink, was, carbon, black, the, red, ink, on, the, scrolls, was, found, to, be, made, with, cinnabar, hgs, mercury, sulfide, there, are, only, four, uses, of, this, red, ink, in, the, entire, collection, of, dead, sea, scroll, fragments, the, black, inks, found, on, the, scrolls, are, mostly, made, of, carbon, soot, from, olive, oil, lamps, honey, oil, vinegar, and, water, were, often, added, to, the, mixture, to, thin, the, ink, to, a, proper, consistency, for, writing, galls, were, sometimes, added, to, the, ink, to, make, it, more, resilient, in, order, to, apply, the, ink, to, the, scrolls, its, writers, used, reed, pens, the, dead, sea, scrolls, were, written, on, parchment, made, of, processed, animal, hide, known, as, vellum, approximately, 85, 5, 90, 5, of, the, scrolls, papyrus, estimated, at, 8, 13, of, the, scrolls, and, sheets, of, bronze, composed, of, about, 99, copper, and, 1, tin, approximately, 1, 5, of, the, scrolls, for, those, scrolls, written, on, animal, hides, scholars, with, the, israeli, antiquities, authority, by, use, of, dna, testing, for, assembly, purposes, believe, that, there, may, be, a, hierarchy, in, the, religious, importance, of, the, texts, based, on, which, type, of, animal, was, used, to, create, the, hide, scrolls, written, on, goat, and, calf, hides, are, considered, by, scholars, to, be, more, significant, in, nature, while, those, written, on, gazelle, or, ibex, are, considered, to, be, less, religiously, significant, in, nature, in, addition, tests, by, the, national, institute, of, nuclear, physics, in, sicily, italy, have, suggested, that, the, origin, of, parchment, of, select, dead, sea, scroll, fragments, is, from, the, qumran, area, itself, by, using, x, ray, and, particle, induced, x, ray, emission, testing, of, the, water, used, to, make, the, parchment, that, were, compared, with, the, water, from, the, area, around, the, qumran, site, the, dead, sea, scrolls, that, were, found, were, originally, preserved, by, the, dry, arid, and, low, humidity, conditions, present, within, the, qumran, area, adjoining, the, dead, sea, in, addition, the, lack, of, the, use, of, tanning, materials, on, the, parchment, of, the, dead, sea, scrolls, and, the, very, low, airflow, in, the, qumran, caves, also, contributed, significantly, to, their, preservation, some, of, the, scrolls, were, found, stored, in, clay, jars, within, the, qumran, caves, further, helping, to, preserve, them, from, deterioration, the, original, handling, of, the, scrolls, by, archaeologists, and, scholars, was, done, inappropriately, and, along, with, their, storage, in, an, uncontrolled, environment, they, began, a, process, of, more, rapid, deterioration, than, they, had, experienced, at, qumran, during, the, first, few, years, in, the, late, 1940s, and, early, 1950s, adhesive, tape, used, to, join, fragments, and, seal, cracks, caused, significant, damage, to, the, documents, the, government, of, jordan, had, recognized, the, urgency, of, protecting, the, scrolls, from, deterioration, and, the, presence, of, the, deterioration, among, the, scrolls, however, the, government, did, not, have, adequate, funds, to, purchase, all, the, scrolls, for, their, protection, and, agreed, to, have, foreign, institutions, purchase, the, scrolls, and, have, them, held, at, their, museum, in, jerusalem, until, they, could, be, adequately, studied, in, early, 1953, they, were, moved, to, the, palestine, archaeological, museum, commonly, called, the, rockefeller, museum, in, east, jerusalem, and, through, their, transportation, suffered, more, deterioration, and, damage, 63, 65, the, museum, was, underfunded, and, had, limited, resources, with, which, to, examine, the, scrolls, and, as, a, result, conditions, of, the, scrollery, and, storage, area, were, left, relatively, uncontrolled, by, modern, standards, the, museum, had, left, most, of, the, fragments, and, scrolls, lying, between, window, glass, trapping, the, moisture, in, with, them, causing, an, acceleration, in, the, deterioration, process, during, a, portion, of, the, conflict, during, the, 1956, war, waged, by, israel, britain, and, france, against, egypt, the, scrolls, collection, of, the, palestine, archaeological, museum, was, stored, in, the, vault, of, the, ottoman, bank, in, amman, jordan, damp, conditions, from, temporary, storage, of, the, scrolls, in, the, ottoman, bank, vault, from, 1956, to, the, spring, of, 1957, led, to, a, more, rapid, rate, of, deterioration, of, the, scrolls, the, conditions, caused, mildew, to, develop, on, the, scrolls, and, fragments, and, some, fragments, were, partially, destroyed, or, made, illegible, by, the, glue, and, paper, of, the, manila, envelopes, in, which, they, were, stored, while, in, the, vault, by, 1958, it, was, noted, that, up, to, 5, of, some, of, the, scrolls, had, completely, deteriorated, many, of, the, texts, had, become, illegible, and, many, of, the, parchments, had, darkened, considerably, until, the, 1970s, the, scrolls, continued, to, deteriorate, because, of, poor, storage, arrangements, exposure, to, different, adhesives, and, being, trapped, in, moist, environments, fragments, written, on, parchment, rather, than, papyrus, or, bronze, in, the, hands, of, private, collectors, and, scholars, suffered, an, even, worse, fate, than, those, in, the, hands, of, the, museum, with, large, portions, of, fragments, being, reported, to, have, disappeared, by, 1966, in, the, late, 1960s, the, deterioration, was, becoming, a, major, concern, with, scholars, and, museum, officials, alike, scholars, john, allegro, and, sir, francis, frank, were, among, the, first, to, strongly, advocate, for, better, preservation, techniques, early, attempts, made, by, both, the, british, and, israel, museums, to, remove, the, adhesive, tape, ended, up, exposing, the, parchment, to, an, array, of, chemicals, including, british, leather, dressing, and, darkening, some, of, them, significantly, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, other, preservation, attempts, were, made, that, included, removing, the, glass, plates, and, replacing, them, with, cardboard, and, removing, pressure, against, the, plates, that, held, the, scrolls, in, storage, however, the, fragments, and, scrolls, continued, to, rapidly, deteriorate, during, this, time, in, 1991, the, israeli, antiquities, authority, established, a, temperature, controlled, laboratory, for, the, storage, and, preservation, of, the, scrolls, the, actions, and, preservation, methods, of, rockefeller, museum, staff, were, concentrated, on, the, removal, of, tape, oils, metals, salt, and, other, contaminants, the, fragments, and, scrolls, are, preserved, using, acid, free, cardboard, and, stored, in, solander, boxes, in, the, climate, controlled, storage, area, nine, tiny, phylactery, slips, were, rediscovered, by, the, israel, antiquities, authority, iaa, in, 2014, after, they, had, been, stored, unopened, for, six, decades, following, their, excavation, in, 1952, the, iaa, is, preparing, to, unroll, the, phylacteries, or, tefillin, once, a, safe, procedure, has, been, decided, upon, since, the, dead, sea, scrolls, were, initially, held, by, different, parties, during, and, after, the, excavation, process, they, were, not, all, photographed, by, the, same, organization, the, first, individual, person, to, photograph, a, portion, of, the, collection, was, john, c, trever, 1916, 2006, a, biblical, scholar, and, archaeologist, who, was, a, resident, for, the, american, schools, of, oriental, research, 68, he, photographed, three, of, the, scrolls, discovered, in, cave, 1, on, 21, february, 1948, both, on, black, and, white, and, standard, color, film, 26, 396, although, an, amateur, photographer, the, quality, of, his, photographs, often, exceeded, the, visibility, of, the, scrolls, themselves, as, over, the, years, the, ink, of, the, texts, quickly, deteriorated, after, they, were, removed, from, their, linen, wrappings, a, majority, of, the, collection, from, the, qumran, caves, was, acquired, by, the, palestine, archaeological, museum, the, museum, had, the, scrolls, photographed, by, najib, albina, a, local, arab, photographer, trained, by, lewis, larsson, of, the, american, colony, in, jerusalem, between, 1952, and, 1967, albina, documented, the, five, stage, process, of, the, sorting, and, assembly, of, the, scrolls, done, by, the, curator, and, staff, of, the, palestine, archaeological, museum, using, infrared, photography, using, a, process, known, today, as, broadband, fluorescence, infrared, photography, or, nir, photography, najib, and, the, team, at, the, museum, produced, over, 1, 750, photographic, plates, of, the, scrolls, and, fragments, 68, the, photographs, were, taken, with, the, scrolls, laid, out, on, animal, skin, using, large, format, film, which, caused, the, text, to, stand, out, making, the, plates, especially, useful, for, assembling, fragments, 68, these, are, the, earliest, photographs, of, the, museum, s, collection, which, was, the, most, complete, in, the, world, at, the, time, and, they, recorded, the, fragments, and, scrolls, before, their, further, decay, in, storage, so, they, are, often, considered, the, best, recorded, copies, of, the, scrolls, beginning, in, 1993, the, united, states, national, aeronautics, and, space, administration, used, digital, infrared, imaging, technology, to, produce, photographs, of, dead, sea, scrolls, fragments, in, partnership, with, the, ancient, biblical, manuscript, center, and, west, semitic, research, nasa, s, jet, propulsion, laboratory, successfully, worked, to, expand, on, the, use, of, infrared, photography, previously, used, to, evaluate, ancient, manuscripts, by, expanding, the, range, of, spectra, at, which, images, are, photographed, nasa, used, this, multi, spectral, imaging, technique, adapted, from, its, remote, sensing, and, planetary, probes, in, order, to, reveal, previously, illegible, text, on, fragments, of, the, dead, sea, scrolls, the, process, uses, a, liquid, crystal, tunable, filter, in, order, to, photograph, the, scrolls, at, specific, wavelengths, of, light, and, as, a, result, image, distortion, is, significantly, diminished, this, method, was, used, with, select, fragments, of, the, dead, sea, scrolls, to, reveal, text, and, details, that, cameras, that, take, photographs, using, a, larger, light, spectrum, could, not, reveal, the, camera, and, digital, imaging, assembly, was, developed, specifically, for, the, purpose, of, photographing, illegible, ancient, texts, on, 18, december, 2012, the, first, output, of, this, project, was, launched, together, with, google, on, the, dedicated, site, deadseascrolls, org, il, the, site, contains, both, digitizations, of, old, images, taken, in, the, 1950s, and, about, 1000, new, images, taken, with, the, new, nasa, technology, scientists, with, the, israeli, antiquities, authority, have, used, dna, from, the, parchment, on, which, the, dead, sea, scrolls, fragments, were, written, in, concert, with, infrared, digital, photography, to, assist, in, the, reassembly, of, the, scrolls, for, scrolls, written, on, parchment, made, from, animal, hide, and, papyrus, scientists, with, the, museum, are, using, dna, code, to, associate, fragments, with, different, scrolls, and, to, help, scholars, determine, which, scrolls, may, hold, greater, significance, based, on, the, type, of, material, that, was, used, in, a, paper, published, in, 2020, in, the, journal, cell, researchers, from, tel, aviv, university, have, shown, that, ancient, dna, extracted, from, the, ancient, scrolls, can, be, used, to, sort, different, scroll, fragments, not, only, based, on, the, animal, species, but, also, based, on, variations, in, the, nuclear, genome, of, individual, fragments, this, effort, enabled, the, researchers, to, match, different, fragments, to, each, other, based, on, their, genetics, and, separate, fragments, which, were, falsely, connected, in, the, past, in, partnership, with, google, the, museum, of, jerusalem, is, working, to, photograph, the, dead, sea, scrolls, and, make, them, available, to, the, public, digitally, although, not, placing, the, images, in, the, public, domain, the, lead, photographer, of, the, project, ardon, bar, hama, and, his, team, are, utilizing, the, alpa, 12, max, camera, accompanied, with, a, leaf, aptus, ii, back, in, order, to, produce, ultra, high, resolution, digital, images, of, the, scrolls, and, fragments, with, photos, taken, at, 1, 200, megapixels, the, results, are, digital, images, that, can, be, used, to, distinguish, details, that, are, invisible, to, the, naked, eye, in, order, to, minimize, damage, to, the, scrolls, and, fragments, photographers, are, using, a, 1, 4000th, of, a, second, exposure, time, and, uv, protected, flash, tubes, the, digital, photography, project, was, estimated, in, 2011, to, cost, approximately, 3, 5, million, u, s, dollars, after, most, of, the, scrolls, and, fragments, were, moved, to, the, palestine, archaeological, museum, in, 1953, scholars, began, to, assemble, them, and, log, them, for, translation, and, study, in, a, room, that, became, known, as, the, scrollery, the, text, of, the, dead, sea, scrolls, is, written, in, four, different, languages, hebrew, aramaic, greek, and, nabataean, some, of, the, fragments, and, scrolls, were, published, early, most, of, the, longer, more, complete, scrolls, were, published, soon, after, their, discovery, all, the, writings, in, cave, 1, appeared, in, print, between, 1950, and, 1956, those, from, eight, other, caves, were, released, in, 1963, and, 1965, saw, the, publication, of, the, psalms, scroll, from, cave, 11, their, translations, into, english, soon, followed, publication, of, the, scrolls, has, taken, many, decades, and, delays, have, been, a, source, of, academic, controversy, the, scrolls, were, controlled, by, a, small, group, of, scholars, headed, by, john, strugnell, while, a, majority, of, scholars, had, access, neither, to, the, scrolls, nor, even, to, photographs, of, the, text, scholars, such, as, norman, golb, publishers, and, writers, such, as, hershel, shanks, and, many, others, argued, for, decades, for, publishing, the, texts, so, that, they, become, available, to, researchers, this, controversy, only, ended, in, 1991, when, the, biblical, archaeology, society, was, able, to, publish, the, facsimile, edition, of, the, dead, sea, scrolls, after, an, intervention, of, the, israeli, government, and, the, israeli, antiquities, authority, iaa, in, 1991, emanuel, tov, was, appointed, as, the, chairman, of, the, dead, sea, scrolls, foundation, and, publication, of, the, scrolls, followed, in, the, same, year, the, majority, of, the, scrolls, consist, of, tiny, brittle, fragments, which, were, published, at, a, pace, considered, by, many, to, be, excessively, slow, during, early, assembly, and, translation, work, by, scholars, through, the, rockefeller, museum, from, the, 1950s, through, the, 1960s, access, to, the, unpublished, documents, was, limited, to, the, editorial, committee, the, content, of, the, scrolls, was, published, in, a, 40, volume, series, by, oxford, university, press, between, 1955, and, 2009, known, as, discoveries, in, the, judaean, desert, in, 1952, the, jordanian, department, of, antiquities, assembled, a, team, of, scholars, to, begin, examining, assembling, and, translating, the, scrolls, with, the, intent, of, publishing, them, the, initial, publication, assembled, by, dominique, barth, lemy, and, j, zef, milik, was, published, as, qumran, cave, 1, in, 1955, after, a, series, of, other, publications, in, the, late, 1980s, and, early, 1990s, and, with, the, appointment, of, the, respected, dutch, israeli, textual, scholar, emanuel, tov, as, editor, in, chief, of, the, dead, sea, scrolls, publication, project, in, 1990, publication, of, the, scrolls, accelerated, tov, s, team, had, published, five, volumes, covering, the, cave, 4, documents, by, 1995, between, 1990, and, 2009, tov, helped, the, team, produce, 32, volumes, the, final, volume, volume, xl, was, published, in, 2009, in, 1991, researchers, at, hebrew, union, college, in, cincinnati, ohio, ben, zion, wacholder, and, martin, abegg, announced, the, creation, of, a, computer, program, that, used, previously, published, scrolls, to, reconstruct, the, unpublished, texts, officials, at, the, huntington, library, in, san, marino, california, led, by, head, librarian, william, andrew, moffett, announced, that, they, would, allow, researchers, unrestricted, access, to, the, library, s, complete, set, of, photographs, of, the, scrolls, in, the, fall, of, that, year, wacholder, published, 17, documents, that, had, been, reconstructed, in, 1988, from, a, concordance, and, had, come, into, the, hands, of, scholars, outside, of, the, international, team, in, the, same, month, there, occurred, the, discovery, and, publication, of, a, complete, set, of, facsimiles, of, the, cave, 4, materials, at, the, huntington, library, thereafter, the, officials, of, the, israel, antiquities, authority, agreed, to, lift, their, long, standing, restrictions, on, the, use, of, the, scrolls, after, further, delays, attorney, william, john, cox, undertook, representation, of, an, undisclosed, client, who, had, provided, a, complete, set, of, the, unpublished, photographs, and, contracted, for, their, publication, professors, robert, eisenman, and, james, robinson, indexed, the, photographs, and, wrote, an, introduction, to, a, facsimile, edition, of, the, dead, sea, scrolls, which, was, published, by, the, biblical, archaeology, society, in, 1991, following, the, publication, of, the, facsimile, edition, professor, elisha, qimron, sued, hershel, shanks, eisenman, robinson, and, the, biblical, archaeology, society, for, copyright, infringement, for, publishing, without, authorization, or, attribution, his, decipherment, of, one, of, the, scrolls, mmt, the, district, court, of, jerusalem, found, in, favour, of, qimron, in, september, 1993, the, court, issued, a, restraining, order, which, prohibited, the, publication, of, the, deciphered, text, and, ordered, defendants, to, pay, qimron, nis, 100, 000, for, infringing, his, copyright, and, the, right, of, attribution, defendants, appealed, the, supreme, court, of, israel, which, approved, the, district, court, s, decision, in, august, 2000, the, supreme, court, further, ordered, that, the, defendants, hand, over, to, qimron, all, the, infringing, copies, the, decision, met, israeli, and, international, criticism, from, copyright, law, scholars, in, november, 2007, the, dead, sea, scrolls, foundation, commissioned, the, london, publisher, facsimile, editions, limited, to, produce, a, facsimile, edition, of, the, great, isaiah, scroll, 1qis, a, the, order, of, the, community, 1qs, and, the, pesher, to, habakkuk, 1qphab, the, facsimile, was, produced, from, 1948, photographs, and, so, more, faithfully, represents, the, condition, of, the, isaiah, scroll, at, the, time, of, its, discovery, than, does, the, current, condition, of, the, real, isaiah, scroll, of, the, first, three, facsimile, sets, one, was, exhibited, at, the, early, christianity, and, the, dead, sea, scrolls, exhibition, in, seoul, south, korea, and, a, second, set, was, purchased, by, the, british, library, in, london, a, further, 46, sets, including, facsimiles, of, three, fragments, from, cave, 4, now, in, the, collection, of, the, national, archaeological, museum, in, amman, jordan, testimonia, 4q175, pesher, isaiah, b, 4q162, and, qohelet, 4q109, were, announced, in, may, 2009, the, edition, is, strictly, limited, to, 49, numbered, sets, of, these, reproductions, on, either, specially, prepared, parchment, paper, or, real, parchment, the, complete, facsimile, set, three, scrolls, including, the, isaiah, scroll, and, the, three, jordanian, fragments, can, be, purchased, for, 60, 000, the, facsimiles, have, since, been, exhibited, in, qumr, n, le, secret, des, manuscrits, de, la, mer, morte, at, the, biblioth, que, nationale, paris, france, 2010, and, verbum, domini, at, the, vatican, rome, italy, 2012, the, text, of, nearly, all, of, the, non, biblical, scrolls, has, been, recorded, and, tagged, for, morphology, by, martin, abegg, jr, the, ben, zion, wacholder, professor, of, dead, sea, scroll, studies, at, trinity, western, university, located, in, langley, british, columbia, canada, it, is, available, on, handheld, devices, through, olive, tree, bible, software, biblereader, on, macs, and, windows, via, emulator, through, accordance, with, a, comprehensive, set, of, cross, references, and, on, windows, through, logos, bible, software, and, bibleworks, the, text, of, almost, all, of, the, non, biblical, texts, from, the, dead, sea, scrolls, was, released, on, cd, rom, by, publisher, e, j, brill, in, 2005, the, 2, 400, page, 6, volume, series, was, assembled, by, an, editorial, team, led, by, donald, w, parry, and, emanuel, tov, unlike, the, text, translations, in, the, physical, publication, discoveries, in, the, judaean, desert, the, texts, are, sorted, by, genres, that, include, religious, law, parabiblical, texts, calendrical, and, sapiental, texts, and, poetic, and, liturgical, works, high, resolution, images, including, infrared, photographs, of, some, of, the, dead, sea, scrolls, are, now, available, online, on, two, dedicated, websites, on, 19, october, 2010, it, was, announced, that, israeli, antiquities, authority, would, scan, the, documents, using, multi, spectral, imaging, technology, developed, by, nasa, to, produce, high, resolution, images, of, the, texts, and, then, through, a, partnership, with, google, make, them, available, online, free, of, charge, on, a, searchable, database, and, complemented, by, translation, and, other, scholarly, tools, two, silver, scroll, shaped, amulets, dated, c, 600, bce, and, containing, portions, of, the, priestly, blessing, from, the, book, of, numbers, were, excavated, in, jerusalem, at, ketef, hinnom, on, 25, september, 2011, the, israel, museum, digital, dead, sea, scrolls, site, went, online, it, gives, users, access, to, searchable, high, resolution, images, of, the, scrolls, as, well, as, short, explanatory, videos, and, background, information, on, the, texts, and, their, history, as, of, may, 2012, five, complete, scrolls, from, the, israel, museum, have, been, digitized, for, the, project, and, are, now, accessible, online, the, great, isaiah, scroll, the, community, rule, scroll, the, commentary, on, habakkuk, scroll, the, temple, scroll, and, the, war, scroll, before, the, discovery, of, the, dead, sea, scrolls, the, oldest, hebrew, language, manuscripts, of, the, bible, were, masoretic, texts, dating, to, the, 10th, century, ce, such, as, the, aleppo, codex, today, the, oldest, known, extant, manuscripts, of, the, masoretic, text, date, from, approximately, the, 9th, century, the, biblical, manuscripts, found, among, the, dead, sea, scrolls, push, that, date, back, a, full, thousand, years, to, the, 2nd, century, bce, this, was, a, significant, discovery, for, old, testament, scholars, who, anticipated, that, the, dead, sea, scrolls, would, either, affirm, or, repudiate, the, reliability, of, textual, transmission, from, the, original, texts, to, the, oldest, masoretic, texts, at, hand, the, discovery, demonstrated, the, unusual, accuracy, of, transmission, over, a, thousand, year, period, rendering, it, reasonable, to, believe, that, current, old, testament, texts, are, reliable, copies, of, the, original, works, according, to, the, dead, sea, scrolls, by, hebrew, scholar, millar, burrows, of, the, 166, words, in, isaiah, 53, there, are, only, seventeen, letters, in, question, ten, of, these, letters, are, simply, a, matter, of, spelling, which, does, not, affect, the, sense, four, more, letters, are, minor, stylistic, changes, such, as, conjunctions, the, remaining, three, letters, comprise, the, word, light, which, is, added, in, verse, 11, and, does, not, affect, the, meaning, greatly, it, is, important, to, note, that, differences, were, found, among, fragments, of, texts, according, to, the, oxford, companion, to, archaeology, while, some, of, the, qumran, biblical, manuscripts, are, nearly, identical, to, the, masoretic, or, traditional, hebrew, text, of, the, old, testament, some, manuscripts, of, the, books, of, exodus, and, samuel, found, in, cave, four, exhibit, dramatic, differences, in, both, language, and, content, in, their, astonishing, range, of, textual, variants, the, qumran, biblical, discoveries, have, prompted, scholars, to, reconsider, the, once, accepted, theories, of, the, development, of, the, modern, biblical, text, from, only, three, manuscript, families, of, the, masoretic, text, of, the, hebrew, original, of, the, septuagint, and, of, the, samaritan, pentateuch, it, is, now, becoming, increasingly, clear, that, the, old, testament, scripture, was, extremely, fluid, until, its, canonization, around, a, d, 100, there, are, 225, biblical, texts, included, in, the, dead, sea, scroll, documents, or, around, 22, of, the, total, and, with, deuterocanonical, books, the, number, increases, to, 235, the, dead, sea, scrolls, contain, parts, of, all, but, one, of, the, books, of, the, tanakh, of, the, hebrew, bible, and, the, old, testament, protocanon, they, also, include, four, of, the, deuterocanonical, books, included, in, catholic, and, eastern, orthodox, bibles, tobit, sirach, baruch, 6, also, known, as, the, letter, or, epistle, of, jeremiah, and, psalm, 151, the, book, of, esther, has, not, yet, been, found, and, scholars, believe, esther, is, missing, because, as, a, jew, her, marriage, to, a, persian, king, may, have, been, looked, down, upon, by, the, inhabitants, of, qumran, or, because, the, book, has, the, purim, festival, which, is, not, included, in, the, qumran, calendar, 180, listed, below, are, the, most, represented, books, along, with, the, deuterocanonicals, of, the, bible, found, among, the, dead, sea, scrolls, including, the, number, of, translatable, dead, sea, texts, that, represent, a, copy, of, scripture, from, each, biblical, book, the, majority, of, the, texts, found, among, the, dead, sea, scrolls, are, non, biblical, in, nature, and, were, thought, to, be, insignificant, for, understanding, the, composition, or, canonization, of, the, biblical, books, but, a, consensus, has, emerged, which, sees, many, of, these, works, as, being, collected, by, the, essene, community, instead, of, being, composed, by, them, scholars, now, recognize, that, some, of, these, works, were, composed, earlier, than, the, essene, period, when, some, of, the, biblical, books, were, still, being, written, or, redacted, into, their, final, form, small, portions, of, the, dead, sea, scrolls, collections, have, been, put, on, temporary, display, in, exhibitions, at, museums, and, public, venues, around, the, world, the, majority, of, these, exhibitions, took, place, in, 1965, in, the, united, states, and, the, united, kingdom, and, from, 1993, to, 2011, in, locations, around, the, world, many, of, the, exhibitions, were, co, sponsored, by, either, the, jordanian, government, pre, 1967, or, the, israeli, government, post, 1967, exhibitions, were, discontinued, after, 1965, due, to, the, six, day, war, conflicts, and, have, slowed, down, in, post, 2011, as, the, israeli, antiquities, authority, works, to, digitize, the, scrolls, and, place, them, in, permanent, cold, storage, the, majority, of, the, dead, sea, scrolls, collection, was, moved, to, jerusalem, s, shrine, of, the, book, a, part, of, the, israel, museum, after, the, building, s, completion, in, april, 1965, the, museum, falls,

a, consequence, that, part, of, the, collection, remained, in, jordanian, hands, under, their, department, of, antiquities, since, 2013, the, part, of, the, collection, held, by, jordan, has, been, on, display, at, the, jordan, museum, in, amman, among, the, display, items, are, artefacts, from, the, qumran, site, and, the, copper, scroll, upon, their, discovery, in, 1947, in, what, was, then, mandatory, palestine, the, dead, sea, scrolls, were, first, moved, to, the, palestine, archaeological, museum, following, the, jordanian, annexation, of, the, west, bank, including, east, jerusalem,

housed, at, the, israel, museum, this, claimed, ownership, is, contested, by, both, jordan, and, the, palestinian, authority, arrangements, with, the, bedouin, left, the, scrolls, in, the, hands, of, a, third, party, until, a, profitable, sale, of, them, could, be, negotiated, that, third, party, george, isha, ya, was, a, member, of, the, syriac, orthodox, church, who, soon, contacted, st, mark, s, monastery, in, the, hope, of, getting, an, appraisal, of, the, nature, of, the, texts, news, of, the, find, then, reached, metropolitan, athanasius, yeshue, samuel, better, known, as, mar, samuel, after, examining, the, scrolls, and, suspecting, their, antiquity, mar, samuel, expressed, an, interest, in, purchasing, them, four, scrolls, found, their, way, into, his, hands, the, isaiah, scroll, 1qisa, a, the, community, rule, the, habakkuk, pesher, a, commentary, on, the, book, of, habakkuk, and, the, genesis, apocryphon, more, scrolls, soon, surfaced, in, the, antiquities, market, and, professor, eleazer, sukenik, and, professor, benjamin, mazar, archaeologists, at, hebrew, university, soon, found, themselves, in, possession, of, three, the, war, scroll, thanksgiving, hymns, and, another, more, fragmented, isaiah, scroll, 1qisa, b, four, of, the, dead, sea, scrolls, eventually, went, up, for, sale, in, an, advertisement, on, 1, june, 1954, the, wall, street, journal, on, 1, july, 1954, the, scrolls, after, delicate, negotiations, and, accompanied, by, three, people, including, the, metropolitan, arrived, at, the, waldorf, astoria, hotel, in, new, york, they, were, purchased, by, professor, mazar, and, the, son, of, professor, sukenik, yigael, yadin, for, 250, 000, approximately, 2, 800, 000, in, 2023, dollars, and, brought, to, jerusalem, since, 2002, many, forgeries, of, dead, sea, scrolls, have, appeared, on, black, markets, in, 2020, the, museum, of, the, bible, in, the, united, states, also, known, as, green, collection, green, family, reported, that, all, 16, purported, dead, sea, scroll, fragments, they, had, acquired, between, 2009, and, 2014, were, in, fact, modern, forgeries, the, official, ownership, of, the, dead, sea, scrolls, is, disputed, among, jordan, israel, and, the, palestinian, authority, the, debate, over, the, dead, sea, scrolls, stems, from, a, more, general, israeli, palestinian, conflict, over, land, and, state, recognition, there, are, three, types, of, documents, relating, to, the, dead, sea, scrolls, in, which, copyright, status, can, be, considered, ambiguous, the, documents, themselves, images, taken, of, the, documents, and, reproductions, of, the, documents, this, ambiguity, arises, from, differences, in, copyright, law, across, different, countries, and, the, variable, interpretation, of, such, law, in, 1992, a, copyright, case, qimron, v, shanks, was, brought, before, the, israeli, district, court, by, scholar, elisha, qimron, against, hershel, shanks, of, the, biblical, archaeology, society, for, violations, of, united, states, copyright, law, regarding, his, publishing, of, reconstructions, of, dead, sea, scroll, texts, done, by, qimron, in, a, facsimile, edition, of, the, dead, sea, scrolls, which, were, included, without, his, permission, qimron, s, suit, against, the, biblical, archaeology, society, was, done, on, the, grounds, that, the, research, they, had, published, was, his, intellectual, property, as, he, had, reconstructed, about, 40, of, the, published, text, in, 1993, the, district, court, judge, dalia, dorner, ruled, for, the, plaintiff, elisha, qimron, in, context, of, both, united, states, and, israeli, copyright, law, and, granted, the, highest, compensation, allowed, by, law, for, aggravation, in, compensation, against, hershel, shanks, and, others, in, an, appeal, in, 2000, in, front, of, judge, aharon, barak, the, verdict, was, upheld, in, israeli, supreme, court, in, qimron, s, favour, the, court, case, established, the, two, main, principles, from, which, facsimiles, are, examined, under, copyright, law, of, the, united, states, and, israel, authorship, and, originality, the, court, s, ruling, not, only, affirms, that, the, deciphered, text, of, the, scrolls, can, fall, under, copyright, of, individuals, or, groups, but, makes, it, clear, that, the, dead, sea, scrolls, themselves, do, not, fall, under, this, copyright, law, and, scholars, have, a, degree, of, in, the, words, of, u, s, copyright, law, professor, david, nimmer, freedom, in, access, nimmer, has, shown, how, this, freedom, was, in, the, theory, of, law, applicable, but, how, it, did, not, exist, in, reality, as, the, israeli, antiquities, authority, tightly, controlled, access, to, the, scrolls, and, photographs, of, the, scrolls, books, other,
