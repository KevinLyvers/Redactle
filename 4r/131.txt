movement, to, influence, literary, culture, outside, of, the, region, and, was, also, the, first, truly, latin, american, literature, in, that, national, differences, were, no, longer, as, much, of, an, issue, and, authors, sought, to, establish, latin, american, connections, jos, mart, for, instance, though, a, cuban, patriot, also, lived, in, mexico, and, the, united, states, and, wrote, for,

critic, sylvia, molloy, describes, though, modernismo, itself, is, often, seen, as, aestheticist, and, anti, political, some, poets, and, essayists, mart, among, them, but, also, the, peruvians, manuel, gonz, lez, prada, and, jos, carlos, mari, tegui, introduced, compelling, critiques, of, the, contemporary, social, order, and, particularly, the, plight, of, latin, america, s, indigenous, peoples, in, this, way, the, early, twentieth, century, also, saw, the, rise, of, indigenismo, a, trend, previously, popularized, by, clorinda, matto, de, turner, that, was, dedicated, to, representing, indigenous, culture, and, the, injustices, that, such, communities, were, undergoing, as, for, instance, with, the, peruvian, jos, mar, a, arguedas, and, the, mexican, rosario, castellanos, resistance, against, colonialism, a, trend, that, emerged, earlier, in, the, 19th, century, was, also, extremely, important, in, modernismo, this, resistance, literature, was, promoted,

states, and, described, how, latin, america, should, avoid, allowing, the, united, states, to, intervene, in, their, affairs, a, prime, example, of, this, sort, of, message, is, found, in, mart, s, our, america, published, in, 1892, dar, o, also, worked, to, highlight, the, threat, of, american, imperialism, which, can, be, seen, in, his, poem, to, roosevelt, as, well, as, his, other, works,
