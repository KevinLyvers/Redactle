not, very, clear, to, express, in, the, english, language, the, term, is, also, used, to, refer, to, acts, and, systems, whose, purpose, may, be, to, provide, security, security, company, security,

the, focus, of, a, security, policy, or, discourse, for, example, a, referent, may, be, a, potential, beneficiary, or, victim, of, a, security, policy, or, system, security, referents, may, be, persons, or, social, groups, objects, institutions, ecosystems, or, any, other, phenomenon, vulnerable, to, unwanted, change, by, the, forces, of, its, environment, the, referent, in, question, may, combine, many, referents, in, the, same, way, that, for, example, a, nation, state, is, composed, of, many, individual, citizens, the, security, context, is, the, relationships, between, a, security, referent, and, its, environment, from, this, perspective, security, and, insecurity, depend, first, on, whether, the, environment, is, beneficial, or, hostile, to, the, referent, and, also, on, how, capable, the, referent, is, of, responding, to, their, environment, in, order, to, survive, and, thrive, the, means, by, which, a, referent, provides, for, security, or, is, provided, for, vary, widely, they, include, for, example, any, action, intended, to, provide, security, may, have, multiple, effects, for, example, an, action, may, have, a, wide, benefit, enhancing, security, for, several, or, all, security, referents, in, the, context, alternatively, the, action, may, be, effective, only, temporarily, benefit, one, referent, at, the, expense, of, another, or, be, entirely, ineffective, or, counterproductive, approaches, to, security, are, contested, and, the, subject, of, debate, for, example, in, debate, about, national, security, strategies, some, argue, that, security, depends, principally, on, developing, protective, and, coercive, capabilities, in, order, to, protect, the, security, referent, in, a, hostile, environment, and, potentially, to, project, that, power, into, its, environment, and, dominate, it, to, the, point, of, strategic, supremacy, others, argue, that, security, depends, principally, on, building, the, conditions, in, which, equitable, relationships, can, develop, partly, by, reducing, antagonism, between, actors, ensuring, that, fundamental, needs, can, be, met, and, also, ensuring, that, differences, of, interest, can, be, negotiated, effectively, the, table, shows, some, of, the, main, domains, where, security, concerns, are, prominent, informational, physical, political, monetary, the, range, of, security, contexts, is, illustrated, by, the, following, examples, in, alphabetical, order, computer, security, also, known, as, cybersecurity, or, it, security, refers, to, the, security, of, computing, devices, such, as, computers, and, smartphones, as, well, as, computer, networks, such, as, private, and, public, networks, and, the, internet, the, field, has, growing, importance, due, to, the, increasing, reliance, on, computer, systems, in, most, societies, it, concerns, the, protection, of, hardware, software, data, people, and, also, the, procedures, by, which, systems, are, accessed, the, means, of, computer, security, include, the, physical, security, of, systems, and, the, security, of, information, held, on, them, corporate, security, refers, to, the, resilience, of, corporations, against, espionage, theft, damage, and, other, threats, the, security, of, corporations, has, become, more, complex, as, reliance, on, it, systems, has, increased, and, their, physical, presence, has, become, more, highly, distributed, across, several, countries, including, environments, that, are, or, may, rapidly, become, hostile, to, them, environmental, security, also, known, as, ecological, security, refers, to, the, integrity, of, ecosystems, and, the, biosphere, particularly, in, relation, to, their, capacity, to, sustain, a, diversity, of, life, forms, including, human, life, the, security, of, ecosystems, has, attracted, greater, attention, as, the, impact, of, ecological, damage, by, humans, has, grown, food, security, refers, to, the, ready, supply, of, and, access, to, safe, and, nutritious, food, food, security, is, gaining, in, importance, as, the, world, s, population, has, grown, and, productive, land, has, diminished, through, overuse, and, climate, change, home, security, normally, refers, to, the, security, systems, used, on, a, property, used, as, a, dwelling, commonly, including, doors, locks, alarm, systems, lighting, fencing, and, personal, security, practices, such, as, ensuring, doors, are, locked, alarms, are, activated, windows, are, closed, etc, human, security, is, an, emerging, paradigm, that, in, response, to, traditional, emphasis, on, the, right, of, nation, states, to, protect, themselves, has, focused, on, the, primacy, of, the, security, of, people, individuals, and, communities, the, concept, is, supported, by, the, united, nations, general, assembly, which, has, stressed, the, right, of, people, to, live, in, freedom, and, dignity, and, recognized, that, all, individuals, in, particular, vulnerable, people, are, entitled, to, freedom, from, fear, and, freedom, from, want, information, security, refers, to, the, security, of, information, in, any, form, spoken, written, digital, networked, technological, and, procedural, forms, of, information, are, all, examples, that, may, be, covered, in, an, information, security, management, scheme, computer, security, it, security, ict, security, and, network, security, are, thus, all, subdomains, of, information, security, national, security, refers, to, the, security, of, a, nation, state, including, its, people, economy, and, institutions, in, practice, state, governments, rely, on, a, wide, range, of, means, including, diplomacy, economic, power, and, military, capabilities, certain, concepts, recur, throughout, different, fields, of, security, since, it, is, not, possible, to, know, with, precision, the, extent, to, which, something, is, secure, and, a, measure, of, vulnerability, is, unavoidable, perceptions, of, security, vary, often, greatly, for, example, a, fear, of, death, by, earthquake, is, common, in, the, united, states, us, but, slipping, on, the, bathroom, floor, kills, more, people, and, in, france, the, united, kingdom, and, the, us, there, are, far, fewer, deaths, caused, by, terrorism, than, there, are, women, killed, by, their, partners, in, the, home, another, problem, of, perception, is, the, common, assumption, that, the, mere, presence, of, a, security, system, such, as, armed, forces, or, antivirus, software, implies, security, for, example, two, computer, security, programs, installed, on, the, same, device, can, prevent, each, other, from, working, properly, while, the, user, assumes, that, he, or, she, benefits, from, twice, the, protection, that, only, one, program, would, afford, security, theater, is, a, critical, term, for, measures, that, change, perceptions, of, security, without, necessarily, affecting, security, itself, for, example, visual, signs, of, security, protections, such, as, a, home, that, advertises, its, alarm, system, may, deter, an, intruder, whether, or, not, the, system, functions, properly, similarly, the, increased, presence, of, military, personnel, on, the, streets, of, a, city, after, a, terrorist, attack, may, help, to, reassure, the, public, whether, or, not, it, diminishes, the, risk, of, further, attacks
