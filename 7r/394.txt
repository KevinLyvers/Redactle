the, phoenician, alphabet, is, an, abjad, consonantal, alphabet, used, across, the, mediterranean, civilization, of, phoenicia, for, most, of, the, 1st, millennium, bc, it, was, the, first, alphabet, ever, developed, and, attested, in, canaanite, and, aramaic, inscriptions, found, across, the, mediterranean, region, in, the, history, of, writing, systems, the, phoenician, script, also, marked, the, first, to, have, a, fixed, writing, direction, while, previous, systems, were, multi, directional, phoenician, was, written, horizontally, from, right, to, left, it, developed, directly, from, the, proto, sinaitic, script, used, during, the, late, bronze, age, which, was, derived, in, turn, from, egyptian, hieroglyphs, the, phoenician, alphabet, was, used, to, write, canaanite, languages, spoken, during, the, early, iron, age, sub, categorized, by, historians, as, phoenician, hebrew, moabite, ammonite, and, edomite, as, well, as, old, aramaic, it, was, widely, disseminated, outside, of, the, canaanite, sphere, by, phoenician, merchants, across, the, mediterranean, where, it, was, adopted, and, adapted, by, other, cultures, the, phoenician, alphabet, proper, was, used, in, ancient, carthage, until, the, 2nd, century, bc, where, it, was, used, to, write, the, punic, language, its, direct, descendant, scripts, include, the, aramaic, and, samaritan, alphabets, several, alphabets, of, asia, minor, and, the, archaic, greek, alphabets, the, phoenician, alphabet, proper, uses, 22, consonant, letters, as, an, abjad, used, to, write, a, semitic, language, the, vowel, sounds, were, left, implicit, though, late, varieties, sometimes, used, matres, lectionis, to, denote, some, vowels, as, its, letters, were, originally, incised, using, a, stylus, their, forms, are, mostly, angular, and, straight, though, cursive, forms, increased, in, use, over, time, culminating, in, the, neo, punic, alphabet, used, in, roman, north, africa, the, earliest, known, proto, alphabetic, inscriptions, are, the, proto, sinaitic, script, sporadically, attested, in, the, sinai, peninsula, and, in, canaan, in, the, late, middle, and, late, bronze, age, the, script, was, not, widely, used, until, the, rise, of, syro, hittite, states, in, the, 13th, and, 12th, centuries, bc, the, phoenician, alphabet, is, a, direct, continuation, of, the, proto, canaanite, script, of, the, bronze, age, collapse, period, the, inscriptions, found, on, the, phoenician, arrowheads, at, al, khader, near, bethlehem, and, dated, c, 1100, bc, offered, the, epigraphists, the, missing, link, between, the, two, the, ahiram, epitaph, whose, dating, is, controversial, engraved, on, the, sarcophagus, of, king, ahiram, in, byblos, lebanon, one, of, five, known, byblian, royal, inscriptions, shows, essentially, the, fully, developed, phoenician, script, although, the, name, phoenician, is, by, convention, given, to, inscriptions, beginning, in, the, mid, 11th, century, bc, beginning, in, the, 9th, century, bc, adaptations, of, the, phoenician, alphabet, thrived, including, greek, old, italic, and, anatolian, scripts, the, alphabet, s, attractive, innovation, was, its, phonetic, nature, in, which, one, sound, was, represented, by, one, symbol, which, meant, only, a, few, dozen, symbols, to, learn, the, other, scripts, of, the, time, cuneiform, and, egyptian, hieroglyphs, employed, many, complex, characters, and, required, long, professional, training, to, achieve, proficiency, which, had, restricted, literacy, to, a, small, elite, another, reason, for, its, success, was, the, maritime, trading, culture, of, phoenician, merchants, which, spread, the, alphabet, into, parts, of, north, africa, and, southern, europe, phoenician, inscriptions, have, been, found, in, archaeological, sites, at, a, number, of, former, phoenician, cities, and, colonies, around, the, mediterranean, such, as, byblos, in, present, day, lebanon, and, carthage, in, north, africa, later, finds, indicate, earlier, use, in, egypt, the, alphabet, had, long, term, effects, on, the, social, structures, of, the, civilizations, that, came, in, contact, with, it, its, simplicity, not, only, allowed, its, easy, adaptation, to, multiple, languages, but, it, also, allowed, the, common, people, to, learn, how, to, write, this, upset, the, long, standing, status, of, literacy, as, an, exclusive, achievement, of, royal, and, religious, elites, scribes, who, used, their, monopoly, on, information, to, control, the, common, population, the, appearance, of, phoenician, disintegrated, many, of, these, class, divisions, although, many, middle, eastern, kingdoms, such, as, assyria, babylonia, and, adiabene, would, continue, to, use, cuneiform, for, legal, and, liturgical, matters, well, into, the, common, era, according, to, herodotus, the, phoenician, prince, cadmus, was, accredited, with, the, introduction, of, the, phoenician, alphabet, phoinikeia, grammata, phoenician, letters, to, the, greeks, who, adapted, it, to, form, their, greek, alphabet, herodotus, claims, that, the, greeks, did, not, know, of, the, phoenician, alphabet, before, cadmus, he, estimates, that, cadmus, lived, 1600, years, before, his, time, while, the, historical, adoption, of, the, alphabet, by, the, greeks, was, barely, 350, years, before, herodotus, the, phoenician, alphabet, was, known, to, the, jewish, sages, of, the, second, temple, era, who, called, it, the, old, hebrew, paleo, hebrew, script, the, conventional, date, of, 1050, bc, for, the, emergence, of, the, phoenician, script, was, chosen, because, there, is, a, gap, in, the, epigraphic, record, there, are, not, actually, any, phoenician, inscriptions, securely, dated, to, the, 11th, century, the, oldest, inscriptions, are, dated, to, the, 10th, century, the, phoenician, alphabet, was, deciphered, in, 1758, by, jean, jacques, barth, lemy, but, its, relation, to, the, phoenicians, remained, unknown, until, the, 19th, century, it, was, at, first, believed, that, the, script, was, a, direct, variation, of, egyptian, hieroglyphs, which, were, deciphered, by, champollion, in, the, early, 19th, century, however, scholars, could, not, find, any, link, between, the, two, writing, systems, nor, to, hieratic, or, cuneiform, the, theories, of, independent, creation, ranged, from, the, idea, of, a, single, individual, conceiving, it, to, the, hyksos, people, forming, it, from, corrupt, egyptian, it, was, eventually, discovered, that, the, proto, sinaitic, alphabet, was, inspired, by, the, model, of, hieroglyphs, the, chart, shows, the, graphical, evolution, of, phoenician, letter, forms, into, other, alphabets, the, sound, values, also, changed, significantly, both, at, the, initial, creation, of, new, alphabets, and, from, gradual, pronunciation, changes, which, did, not, immediately, lead, to, spelling, changes, the, phoenician, letter, forms, shown, are, idealized, actual, phoenician, writing, is, less, uniform, with, significant, variations, by, era, and, region, when, alphabetic, writing, began, with, the, early, greek, alphabet, the, letter, forms, were, similar, but, not, identical, to, phoenician, and, vowels, were, added, to, the, consonant, only, phoenician, letters, there, were, also, distinct, variants, of, the, writing, system, in, different, parts, of, greece, primarily, in, how, those, phoenician, characters, that, did, not, have, an, exact, match, to, greek, sounds, were, used, the, ionic, variant, evolved, into, the, standard, greek, alphabet, and, the, cumae, variant, into, the, italic, alphabets, including, the, latin, alphabet, the, runic, alphabet, is, derived, from, italic, the, cyrillic, alphabet, from, medieval, greek, the, hebrew, syriac, and, arabic, scripts, are, derived, from, aramaic, the, latter, as, a, medieval, cursive, variant, of, nabataean, ge, ez, is, from, south, arabian, phoenician, used, a, system, of, acrophony, to, name, letters, a, word, was, chosen, with, each, initial, consonant, sound, and, became, the, name, of, the, letter, for, that, sound, these, names, were, not, arbitrary, each, phoenician, letter, was, based, on, an, egyptian, hieroglyph, representing, an, egyptian, word, this, word, was, translated, into, phoenician, or, a, closely, related, semitic, language, then, the, initial, sound, of, the, translated, word, became, the, letter, s, phoenician, value, for, example, the, second, letter, of, the, phoenician, alphabet, was, based, on, the, egyptian, hieroglyph, for, house, a, sketch, of, a, house, the, semitic, word, for, house, was, bet, hence, the, phoenician, letter, was, called, bet, and, had, the, sound, value, b, according, to, a, 1904, theory, by, theodor, n, ldeke, some, of, the, letter, names, were, changed, in, phoenician, from, the, proto, canaanite, script, this, includes, yigael, yadin, 1963, went, to, great, lengths, to, prove, that, there, was, actual, battle, equipment, similar, to, some, of, the, original, letter, forms, named, for, weapons, samek, zayin, later, the, greeks, kept, approximations, of, the, phoenician, names, albeit, they, did, not, mean, anything, to, them, other, than, the, letters, themselves, on, the, other, hand, the, latins, and, presumably, the, etruscans, from, whom, they, borrowed, a, variant, of, the, western, greek, alphabet, and, the, orthodox, slavs, at, least, when, naming, the, cyrillic, letters, which, came, to, them, from, the, greek, by, way, of, the, glagolitic, based, their, names, purely, on, the, letters, sounds, the, phoenician, numeral, system, consisted, of, separate, symbols, for, 1, 10, 20, and, 100, the, sign, for, 1, was, a, simple, vertical, stroke, other, numerals, up, to, 9, were, formed, by, adding, the, appropriate, number, of, such, strokes, arranged, in, groups, of, three, the, symbol, for, 10, was, a, horizontal, line, or, tack, the, sign, for, 20, could, come, in, different, glyph, variants, one, of, them, being, a, combination, of, two, 10, tacks, approximately, z, shaped, larger, multiples, of, ten, were, formed, by, grouping, the, appropriate, number, of, 20s, and, 10s, there, existed, several, glyph, variants, for, 100, the, 100, symbol, could, be, multiplied, by, a, preceding, numeral, e, g, the, combination, of, 4, and, 100, yielded, 400, the, system, did, not, contain, a, numeral, zero, phoenician, was, prolific, many, of, the, writing, systems, in, use, today, can, ultimately, trace, their, descent, to, it, so, ultimately, to, egyptian, hieroglyphs, the, latin, cyrillic, armenian, and, georgian, scripts, are, derived, from, the, greek, alphabet, which, evolved, from, phoenician, the, aramaic, alphabet, also, descended, from, phoenician, evolved, into, the, arabic, and, hebrew, scripts, it, has, also, been, theorised, that, the, brahmi, and, subsequent, brahmic, scripts, of, the, indian, cultural, sphere, also, descended, from, aramaic, effectively, uniting, most, of, the, world, s, writing, systems, under, one, family, although, the, theory, is, disputed, the, paleo, hebrew, alphabet, is, a, regional, variant, of, the, phoenician, alphabet, so, called, when, used, to, write, early, hebrew, the, samaritan, alphabet, is, a, development, of, paleo, hebrew, emerging, in, the, 6th, century, bc, the, south, arabian, script, may, be, derived, from, a, stage, of, the, proto, sinaitic, script, predating, the, mature, development, of, the, phoenician, alphabet, proper, the, ge, ez, script, developed, from, south, arabian, the, phoenician, alphabet, continued, to, be, used, by, the, samaritans, and, developed, into, the, samaritan, alphabet, that, is, an, immediate, continuation, of, the, phoenician, script, without, intermediate, non, israelite, evolutionary, stages, the, samaritans, have, continued, to, use, the, script, for, writing, both, hebrew, and, aramaic, texts, until, the, present, day, a, comparison, of, the, earliest, samaritan, inscriptions, and, the, medieval, and, modern, samaritan, manuscripts, clearly, indicates, that, the, samaritan, script, is, a, static, script, which, was, used, mainly, as, a, book, hand, the, aramaic, alphabet, used, to, write, aramaic, is, an, early, descendant, of, phoenician, aramaic, being, the, lingua, franca, of, the, middle, east, was, widely, adopted, it, later, split, off, into, a, number, of, related, alphabets, including, hebrew, syriac, and, nabataean, the, latter, of, which, in, its, cursive, form, became, an, ancestor, of, the, arabic, alphabet, the, hebrew, alphabet, emerges, in, the, second, temple, period, from, around, 300, bc, out, of, the, aramaic, alphabet, used, in, the, persian, empire, there, was, however, a, revival, of, the, phoenician, mode, of, writing, later, in, the, second, temple, period, with, some, instances, from, the, qumran, caves, such, as, the, paleo, hebrew, leviticus, scroll, dated, to, the, 2nd, or, 1st, century, bc, by, the, 5th, century, bc, among, jews, the, phoenician, alphabet, had, been, mostly, replaced, by, the, aramaic, alphabet, as, officially, used, in, the, persian, empire, which, like, all, alphabetical, writing, systems, was, itself, ultimately, a, descendant, of, the, proto, canaanite, script, though, through, intermediary, non, israelite, stages, of, evolution, the, jewish, square, script, variant, now, known, simply, as, the, hebrew, alphabet, evolved, directly, out, of, the, aramaic, script, by, about, the, 3rd, century, bc, although, some, letter, shapes, did, not, become, standard, until, the, 1st, century, ad, the, kharosthi, script, is, an, aramaic, derived, alphasyllabary, used, in, the, indo, greek, kingdom, in, the, 3rd, century, bc, the, syriac, alphabet, is, the, derived, form, of, aramaic, used, in, the, early, christian, period, the, sogdian, alphabet, is, derived, from, syriac, it, is, in, turn, an, ancestor, of, the, old, uyghur, the, manichaean, alphabet, is, a, further, derivation, from, sogdian, the, arabic, script, is, a, medieval, cursive, variant, of, nabataean, itself, an, offshoot, of, aramaic, it, has, been, proposed, notably, by, georg, b, hler, 1898, that, the, brahmi, script, of, india, and, by, extension, the, derived, indic, alphabets, was, ultimately, derived, from, the, aramaic, script, which, would, make, phoenician, the, ancestor, of, virtually, every, alphabetic, writing, system, in, use, today, with, the, notable, exception, of, hangul, it, is, certain, that, the, aramaic, derived, kharosthi, script, was, present, in, northern, india, by, the, 4th, century, bc, so, that, the, aramaic, model, of, alphabetic, writing, would, have, been, known, in, the, region, but, the, link, from, kharosthi, to, the, slightly, younger, brahmi, is, tenuous, b, hler, s, suggestion, is, still, entertained, in, mainstream, scholarship, but, it, has, never, been, proven, conclusively, and, no, definitive, scholarly, consensus, exists, the, greek, alphabet, is, derived, from, the, phoenician, with, a, different, phonology, the, greeks, adapted, the, phoenician, script, to, represent, their, own, sounds, including, the, vowels, absent, in, phoenician, it, was, possibly, more, important, in, greek, to, write, out, vowel, sounds, phoenician, being, a, semitic, language, words, were, based, on, consonantal, roots, that, permitted, extensive, removal, of, vowels, without, loss, of, meaning, a, feature, absent, in, the, indo, european, greek, however, akkadian, cuneiform, which, wrote, a, related, semitic, language, did, indicate, vowels, which, suggests, the, phoenicians, simply, accepted, the, model, of, the, egyptians, who, never, wrote, vowels, in, any, case, the, greeks, repurposed, the, phoenician, letters, of, consonant, sounds, not, present, in, greek, each, such, letter, had, its, name, shorn, of, its, leading, consonant, and, the, letter, took, the, value, of, the, now, leading, vowel, for, example, leph, which, designated, a, glottal, stop, in, phoenician, was, repurposed, to, represent, the, vowel, a, he, became, e, et, became, e, a, long, vowel, ayin, became, o, because, the, pharyngeality, altered, the, following, vowel, while, the, two, semi, consonants, wau, and, yod, became, the, corresponding, high, vowels, u, and, i, some, dialects, of, greek, which, did, possess, h, and, w, continued, to, use, the, phoenician, letters, for, those, consonants, as, well, the, alphabets, of, asia, minor, are, generally, assumed, to, be, offshoots, of, archaic, versions, of, the, greek, alphabet, the, latin, alphabet, was, derived, from, old, italic, originally, derived, from, a, form, of, the, greek, alphabet, used, for, etruscan, and, other, languages, the, origin, of, the, runic, alphabet, is, disputed, the, main, theories, are, that, it, evolved, either, from, the, latin, alphabet, itself, some, early, old, italic, alphabet, via, the, alpine, scripts, or, the, greek, alphabet, despite, this, debate, the, runic, alphabet, is, clearly, derived, from, one, or, more, scripts, that, ultimately, trace, their, roots, back, to, the, phoenician, alphabet, the, coptic, alphabet, is, mostly, based, on, the, mature, greek, alphabet, of, the, hellenistic, period, with, a, few, additional, letters, for, sounds, not, in, greek, at, the, time, those, additional, letters, are, based, on, the, demotic, script, the, cyrillic, script, was, derived, from, the, late, medieval, greek, alphabet, some, cyrillic, letters, generally, for, sounds, not, in, medieval, greek, are, based, on, glagolitic, forms, these, were, an, indigenous, set, of, genetically, related, semisyllabaries, which, suited, the, phonological, characteristics, of, the, tartessian, iberian, and, celtiberian, languages, they, were, deciphered, in, 1922, by, manuel, g, mez, moreno, but, their, content, is, almost, impossible, to, understand, because, they, are, not, related, to, any, living, languages, while, g, mez, moreno, first, pointed, to, a, joined, phoenician, greek, origin, following, authors, consider, that, their, genesis, has, no, relation, to, greek, the, most, remote, script, of, the, group, is, the, tartessian, or, southwest, script, which, could, be, one, or, several, different, scripts, the, main, bulk, of, ph, inscriptions, use, by, far, the, northeastern, iberian, script, which, serves, to, write, iberian, in, the, levantine, coast, north, of, contestania, and, in, the, valle, of, the, river, ebro, hiber, the, iberic, language, is, also, recorded, using, two, other, scripts, the, southeastern, iberian, script, which, is, more, similar, to, the, southwest, script, than, to, northeastern, iberian, and, a, variant, of, the, ionic, greek, alphabet, called, the, greco, iberian, alphabet, finally, the, celtiberian, script, registers, the, language, of, the, celtiberians, with, a, script, derived, from, northeastern, iberian, an, interesting, feature, is, that, it, was, used, and, developed, in, times, of, the, roman, conquest, in, opposition, to, the, latin, alphabet, among, the, distinctive, features, of, paleohispanic, scripts, are, b, g, d, h, w, z, y, k, l, m, n, s, p, q, r, t
