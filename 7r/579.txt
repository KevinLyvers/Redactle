photojournalism, is, distinguished, from, other, close, branches, of, photography, such, as, documentary, photography, social, documentary, photography, war, photography, street, photography, and, celebrity, photography, by, having, a, rigid, ethical, framework, which, demands, an, honest, and, impartial, approach, that, tells, a, story, in, strictly, journalistic, terms, photojournalists, contribute, to, the, news, media, and, help, communities, connect, with, one, other, they, must, be, well, informed, and, knowledgeable, and, are, able, to, deliver, news, in, a, creative, manner, that, is, both, informative, and, entertaining, similar, to, a, writer, a, photojournalist, is, a, reporter, but, they, must, often, make, decisions, instantly, and, carry, photographic, equipment, often, while, exposed, to, significant, obstacles, among, them, immediate, physical, danger, bad, weather, large, crowds, and, limited, physical, access, to, their, subjects, the, practice, of, illustrating, news, stories, with, photographs, was, made, possible, by, printing, and, photography, innovations, that, occurred, in, the, mid, 19th, century, although, early, illustrations, had, appeared, in, newspapers, such, as, an, illustration, of, the, funeral, of, lord, horatio, nelson, in, the, times, 1806, the, first, weekly, illustrated, newspaper, was, the, illustrated, london, news, first, printed, in, 1842, the, illustrations, were, printed, with, the, use, of, engravings, the, first, photograph, to, be, used, in, illustration, of, a, newspaper, story, was, a, depiction, of, barricades, in, paris, during, the, june, days, uprising, taken, on, 25, june, 1848, the, photo, was, published, as, an, engraving, in, l, illustration, of, 1, 8, july, 1848, during, the, crimean, war, the, iln, pioneered, the, birth, of, early, photojournalism, by, printing, pictures, of, the, war, that, had, been, taken, by, roger, fenton, fenton, was, the, first, official, war, photographer, and, his, work, included, documenting, the, effects, of, the, war, on, the, troops, panoramas, of, the, landscapes, where, the, battles, took, place, model, representations, of, the, action, and, portraits, of, commanders, which, laid, the, groundwork, for, modern, photojournalism, other, photographers, of, the, war, included, william, simpson, and, carol, szathmari, similarly, the, american, civil, war, photographs, of, mathew, brady, were, engraved, before, publication, in, harper, s, weekly, the, technology, had, not, yet, developed, to, the, point, of, being, able, to, print, photographs, in, newspapers, which, greatly, restricted, the, audience, of, brady, s, photographs, however, it, was, still, common, for, photographs, to, be, engraved, and, subsequently, printed, in, newspapers, or, periodicals, throughout, the, war, disaster, including, train, wrecks, and, city, fires, was, also, a, popular, subject, for, illustrated, newspapers, in, the, early, days, the, printing, of, images, in, newspapers, remained, an, isolated, occurrence, in, this, period, photos, were, used, to, enhance, the, text, rather, than, to, act, as, a, medium, of, information, in, its, own, right, this, began, to, change, with, the, work, of, one, of, the, pioneers, of, photojournalism, john, thomson, in, the, late, 1870s, in, collaboration, with, the, radical, journalist, adolphe, smith, he, began, publishing, a, monthly, magazine, street, life, in, london, from, 1876, to, 1877, the, project, documented, in, photographs, and, text, the, lives, of, the, street, people, of, london, and, established, social, documentary, photography, as, a, form, of, photojournalism, instead, of, the, images, acting, as, a, supplement, to, the, text, he, pioneered, the, use, of, printed, photographs, as, the, predominant, medium, for, the, imparting, of, information, successfully, combining, photography, with, the, printed, word, on, march, 4, 1880, the, daily, graphic, new, york, published, the, first, halftone, rather, than, engraved, reproduction, of, a, news, photograph, in, march, 1886, when, general, george, crook, received, word, that, the, apache, leader, geronimo, would, negotiate, surrender, terms, photographer, c, s, fly, took, his, equipment, and, attached, himself, to, the, military, column, during, the, three, days, of, negotiations, fly, took, about, 15, exposures, on, 8, by, 10, inches, 200, by, 250, mm, glass, negatives, his, photos, of, geronimo, and, the, other, free, apaches, taken, on, march, 25, and, 26, are, the, only, known, photographs, taken, of, american, indians, while, still, at, war, with, the, united, states, fly, coolly, posed, his, subjects, asking, them, to, move, and, turn, their, heads, and, faces, to, improve, his, composition, the, popular, publication, harper, s, weekly, published, six, of, his, images, in, their, april, 24, 1886, issue, in, 1887, flash, powder, was, invented, enabling, journalists, such, as, jacob, riis, to, photograph, informal, subjects, indoors, which, led, to, the, landmark, 1890, book, how, the, other, half, lives, by, 1897, it, became, possible, to, reproduce, halftone, photographs, on, printing, presses, running, at, full, speed, in, france, agencies, such, as, rol, branger, and, chusseau, flaviens, ca, 1880, 1910, syndicated, photographs, from, around, the, world, to, meet, the, need, for, timely, new, illustration, despite, these, innovations, limitations, remained, and, many, of, the, sensational, newspaper, and, magazine, stories, in, the, period, from, 1897, to, 1927, were, illustrated, with, engravings, in, 1921, the, wirephoto, made, it, possible, to, transmit, pictures, almost, as, quickly, as, news, itself, could, travel, the, golden, age, of, photojournalism, is, often, considered, to, be, roughly, the, 1930s, through, the, 1950s, it, was, made, possible, by, the, development, of, the, compact, commercial, 35mm, leica, camera, in, 1925, and, the, first, flash, bulbs, between, 1927, and, 1930, which, allowed, the, journalist, true, flexibility, in, taking, pictures, a, new, style, of, magazine, and, newspaper, appeared, that, used, photography, more, than, text, to, tell, stories, the, berliner, illustrirte, zeitung, was, the, first, to, pioneer, the, format, of, the, illustrated, news, magazine, beginning, in, 1901, it, began, to, print, photographs, inside, the, magazine, a, revolutionary, innovation, in, the, successive, decades, it, was, developed, into, the, prototype, of, the, modern, news, magazine, it, pioneered, the, photo, essay, had, a, specialised, staff, and, production, unit, for, pictures, and, maintained, a, photo, library, it, also, introduced, the, use, of, candid, photographs, taken, with, the, new, smaller, cameras, the, magazine, sought, out, reporters, who, could, tell, a, story, using, photographs, notably, the, pioneer, sports, photographer, martin, munk, csi, the, first, staff, photographer, and, erich, salomon, one, of, the, founders, of, photojournalism, other, magazines, included, arbeiter, illustrierte, zeitung, berlin, vu, france, life, usa, look, usa, picture, post,

bourke, white, and, w, eugene, smith, henri, cartier, bresson, is, held, by, some, to, be, the, father, of, modern, photojournalism, although, this, appellation, has, been, applied, to, various, other, photographers, such, as, erich, salomon, whose, candid, pictures, of, political, figures, were, novel, in, the, 1930s, the, photojournalism, of, for, example, agust, centelles, played, an, important, role, in, the, propaganda, efforts, of, the, republican, side, in, the, spanish, civil, war, in, the, late, 1930s, american, journalist, julien, bryan, photographed, and, filmed, the, beginning, of, the, second, world, war, being, under, heavy, german, bombardment, in, september, 1939, in, poland, he, was, pioneer, worker, in, color, photography, kodachrome, william, vandivert,

war, ii, his, images, taken, with, the, modest, argus, c3, captured, horrific, moments, in, war, similar, to, capa, s, spanish, soldier, being, shot, capa, himself, was, on, omaha, beach, on, d, day, and, captured, pivotal, images, of, the, conflict, on, that, occasion, vaccaro, is, also, known, for, having, developed, his, own, images, in, soldier, s, helmets, and, using, chemicals, found, in, the, ruins, of, a, camera, store, in, 1944, until, the, 1980s, most, large, newspapers, were, printed, with, turn, of, the, century, letterpress, technology, using, easily, smudged, oil, based, ink, off, white, low, quality, newsprint, paper, and, coarse, engraving, screens, while, letterpresses, produced, legible, text, the, photoengraving, dots, that, formed, pictures, often, bled, or, smeared, and, became, fuzzy, and, indistinct, in, this, way, even, when, newspapers, used, photographs, well, a, good, crop, a, respectable, size, murky, reproduction, often, left, readers, re, reading, the, caption, to, see, what, the, photo, was, all, about, the, wall, street, journal, adopted, stippled, hedcuts, in, 1979, to, publish, portraits, and, avoid, the, limitations, of, letterpress, printing, not, until, the, 1980s, did, a, majority, of, newspapers, switch, to, offset, presses, that, reproduce, photos, with, fidelity, on, better, whiter, paper, by, contrast, life, one, of, america, s, most, popular, weekly, magazines, from, 1936, through, the, early, 1970s, was, filled, with, photographs, reproduced, beautifully, on, oversize, 11, 14, inch, pages, using, fine, engraving, screens, high, quality, inks, and, glossy, paper, life, often, published, a, united, press, international, upi, or, associated, press, ap, photo, that, had, been, first, reproduced, in, newspapers, but, the, quality, magazine, version, appeared, to, be, a, different, photo, altogether, in, large, part, because, their, pictures, were, clear, enough, to, be, appreciated, and, because, their, name, always, appeared, with, their, work, magazine, photographers, achieved, near, celebrity, status, life, became, a, standard, by, which, the, public, judged, photography, and, many, of, today, s, photo, books, celebrate, photojournalism, as, if, it, had, been, the, exclusive, province, of, near, celebrity, magazine, photographers, in, 1947, a, few, famous, photographers, founded, the, international, photographic, cooperative, magnum, photos, in, 1989, corbis, corporation, and, in, 1995, getty, images, were, founded, these, powerful, image, libraries, sell, the, rights, to, photographs, and, other, still, images, the, golden, age, of, photojournalism, ended, in, the, 1970s, when, many, photo, magazines, ceased, publication, most, prominently, life, which, ended, weekly, publication, in, december, 1972, they, found, that, they, could, not, compete, with, other, media, for, advertising, revenue, to, sustain, their, large, circulations, and, high, costs, still, those, magazines, taught, journalism, much, about, the, photographic, essay, and, the, power, of, still, images, however, since, the, late, 1970s, photojournalism, and, documentary, photography, have, increasingly, been, accorded, a, place, in, art, galleries, alongside, fine, art, photography, luc, delahaye, manuel, rivera, ortiz, and, the, members, of, vii, photo, agency, are, among, many, who, regularly, exhibit,

photograph, what, to, include, in, the, frame, how, to, curate, and, how, to, edit, are, constant, considerations, photographing, news, for, an, assignment, or, to, illustrate, a, story, can, present, many, possible, ethical, problems, photojournalists, have, a, moral, responsibility, to, decide, what, pictures, to, take, what, picture, to, stage, and, what, pictures, to, show, the, public, for, example, photographs, of, violence, and, tragedy, are, prevalent, in, american, journalism, because, as, an, understated, rule, of, thumb, if, it, bleeds, it, leads, the, public, may, be, attracted, to, the, spectacle, of, gruesome, photographs, and, dramatic, stories, controversy, may, arise, when, deciding, which, photographs, are, too, violent, to, show, the, public, photographs, of, the, dead, or, injured, arouse, controversy, because, more, often, than, not, the, name, of, person, depicted, in, the, photograph, is, not, given, in, the, caption, the, photograph, of, the, street, execution, of, a, viet, cong, soldier, during, the, vietnam, war, provoked, a, lot, of, interest, because, it, captured, the, exact, moment, of, death, the, victim, s, wife, learned, about, her, husband, s, death, when, she, was, given, a, newspaper, with, the, photo, on, the, front, page, this, photo, has, claimed, a, reputation, of, galvanizing, the, anti, war, movement, in, the, united, states, and, impacted, many, people, s, perception, of, the, war, being, exposed, to, such, violence, can, have, physiological, and, psychological, effects, on, those, who, document, it, and, is, but, one, of, many, different, forms, of, emotional, labor, that, photojournalists, report, experiencing, in, this, case, the, photographer, eddie, adams, was, quoted, saying, i, was, getting, money, for, showing, one, man, killing, another, two, lives, were, destroyed, and, i, was, getting, paid, for, it, i, was, a, hero, he, expressed, how, this, photo, haunted, him, due, to, its, impact, on, the, world, a, key, example, of, how, impactful, photography, can, be, is, found, during, documentation, of, the, civil, rights, movement, bill, hudson, was, in, birmingham, alabama, on, a, quest, to, document, the, peaceful, protests, of, the, movement, when, he, took, a, photo, of, high, school, student, walter, gadsden, in, this, photograph, gadsden, appeared, to, be, attacked, by, a, police, dog, and, the, resulting, image, brought, the, gory, side, of, the, movement, to, everyone, s, attention, the, photo, was, seen, above, the, fold, in, the, may, 1963, new, york, times, in, the, case, of, this, particular, photograph, it, helped, change, the, path, of, the, civil, rights, movement, and, gained, it, even, more, attention, other, issues, involving, photojournalism, include, the, right, to, privacy, negotiating, how, the, subject, desires, to, be, depicted, and, questions, of, whether, compensation, is, warranted, especially, regarding, pictures, of, violence, photojournalists, face, the, ethical, dilemma, of, whether, or, not, to, publish, images, of, the, victims, the, victim, s, right, to, privacy, is, sometimes, not, addressed, or, the, picture, is, printed, without, their, knowledge, or, consent, another, major, issue, of, photojournalism, is, photo, manipulation, what, degree, is, acceptable, some, pictures, are, simply, manipulated, for, color, enhancement, whereas, others, are, manipulated, to, the, extent, where, people, are, edited, in, or, out, of, the, picture, war, photography, has, always, been, a, genre, of, photojournalism, that, is, frequently, staged, due, to, the, bulkiness, and, types, of, cameras, present, during, past, wars, in, history, it, was, rare, when, a, photograph, could, capture, a, spontaneous, news, event, subjects, were, carefully, composed, and, staged, in, order, to, capture, better, images, another, ethical, issue, is, false, or, misleading, captioning, the, 2006, lebanon, war, photographs, controversies, is, a, notable, example, of, some, of, these, issue, and, see, photo, manipulation, use, in, journalism, for, other, examples, the, emergence, of, digital, photography, offers, new, realms, of, opportunity, for, the, manipulation, reproduction, and, transmission, of, images, it, has, inevitably, complicated, many, of, the, ethical, issues, involved, often, ethical, conflicts, can, be, mitigated, or, enhanced, by, the, actions, of, a, sub, editor, or, picture, editor, who, takes, control, of, the, images, once, they, have, been, delivered, to, the, news, organization, the, photojournalist, often, has, no, control, as, to, how, images, are, ultimately, used, the, national, press, photographers, association, nppa, is, an, american, professional, society, that, emphasizes, photojournalism, members, of, the, nppa, accept, the, following, code, of, ethics, most, photojournalists, consider, stage, managed, shots, presented, as, candid, to, be, unethical, there, have, been, examples, in, the, history, of, photojournalism, of, photographers, purposefully, deceiving, their, audience, by, doing, so, mike, meadows, a, veteran, photographer, of, the, los, angeles, times, was, covering, a, major, wild, fire, sweeping, southern, california, on, 27, october, 1993, his, picture, of, a, los, angeles, county, firefighter, mike, alves, cooling, himself, off, with, water, in, a, pool, in, altadena, ran, both, in, the, times, and, nationally, prior, to, submitting, the, photograph, for, a, pulitzer, prize, meadows, assignment, editor, fred, sweets, contacted, the, firefighter, who, reportedly, said, he, had, been, asked, by, meadows, to, go, to, the, pool, and, splash, water, on, his, head, meadows, denied, the, accusation, claiming, i, may, have, been, guilty, of, saying, this, would, make, a, nice, shot, but, to, the, best, of, my, recollection, i, did, not, directly, ask, him, to, do, that, i, ve, been, doing, breaking, news, stories, for, years, and, years, and, i, ve, never, in, my, life, set, up, a, picture, meadows, was, suspended, without, pay, for, a, week, and, picture, was, withdrawn, from, any, prize, competitions, the, times, called, it, a, fabrication, and, the, paper, s, photography, director, larry, armstrong, said, when, you, manipulate, the, situation, you, manipulate, the, news, edward, keating, a, pulitzer, prize, winner, from, the, new, york, times, photographed, a, young, boy, pointing, a, toy, gun, outside, a, middle, eastern, grocery, store, near, a, town, where, the, fbi, raided, an, alleged, al, qaeda, cell, other, photographers, at, the, scene, claimed, that, keating, pointed, with, his, own, arm, to, show, the, boy, which, way, to, look, and, aim, the, gun, after, the, columbia, journalism, review, reported, the, incident, keating, was, forced, to, leave, the, paper, as, early, as, the, crimean, war, in, the, mid, 19th, century, photographers, were, using, the, novel, technology, of, the, glass, plate, camera, to, record, images, of, british, soldiers, in, the, field, as, a, result, they, had, to, deal, with, not, only, war, conditions, but, their, pictures, often, required, long, shutter, speeds, and, they, had, to, prepare, each, plate, before, taking, the, shot, and, develop, it, immediately, after, this, led, to, for, example, roger, fenton, traveling, around, in, a, transportable, dark, room, which, at, times, made, him, a, target, of, the, enemy, these, technological, barriers, are, why, he, was, unable, to, obtain, any, direct, images, of, the, action, the, use, of, photography, as, a, way, of, reporting, news, did, not, become, widespread, until, the, advent, of, smaller, more, portable, cameras, that, used, an, enlargeable, film, negative, to, record, images, the, introduction, of, the, 35, mm, leica, camera, in, 1925, made, it, possible, for, photographers, to, move, with, the, action, take, multiple, shots, of, events, as, they, were, unfolding, as, well, as, be, more, able, to, create, a, narrative, through, their, photographs, alone, since, the, 1960s, motor, drives, electronic, flash, auto, focus, better, lenses, and, other, camera, enhancements, have, made, picture, taking, easier, new, digital, cameras, free, photojournalists, from, the, limitation, of, film, roll, length, although, the, number, depends, on, the, amount, of, megapixels, the, camera, contains, whether, one, s, shooting, mode, is, jpeg, or, raw, and, what, size, of, memory, card, one, is, using, it, is, possible, to, store, thousands, of, images, on, a, single, memory, card, social, media, are, playing, a, big, part, in, revealing, world, events, to, a, vast, audience, whenever, there, is, a, major, event, in, the, world, there, are, usually, people, with, camera, phones, ready, to, capture, photos, and, post, them, on, various, social, networks, such, convenience, allows, the, associated, press, and, other, companies, to, reach, out, to, the, citizen, journalist, who, holds, ownership, of, the, photos, and, get, permission, to, use, those, photos, in, news, outlets, the, content, of, photos, tends, to, outweigh, their, quality, when, it, comes, to, news, value, on, february, 18, 2004, the, new, york, times, published, on, their, front, page, a, photo, of, at, t, ceo, john, zeglis, which, was, taken, with, a, camera, phone, content, remains, the, most, important, element, of, photojournalism, but, the, ability, to, extend, deadlines, with, rapid, gathering, and, editing, of, images, has, brought, significant, changes, even, by, the, end, of, the, 1990s, when, digital, cameras, such, as, the, nikon, d1, and, the, canon, eos, d30, were, still, in, their, infancy, nearly, 30, minutes, were, needed, to, scan, and, transmit, a, single, color, photograph, from, a, remote, location, to, a, news, office, for, printing, now, equipped, with, a, digital, camera, a, mobile, phone, and, a, laptop, computer, a, photojournalist, can, send, a, high, quality, image, in, minutes, even, seconds, after, an, event, occurs, camera, phones, and, portable, satellite, links, increasingly, allow, for, the, mobile, transmission, of, images, from, almost, any, point, on, the, earth, there, is, some, concern, by, news, photographers, that, the, profession, of, photojournalism, as, it, is, known, today, could, change, to, such, a, degree, that, it, is, unrecognizable, as, image, capturing, technology, naturally, progresses, staff, photojournalism, jobs, continued, to, dwindle, in, the, 2010s, and, some, of, the, largest, news, media, outlets, in, the, u, s, now, rely, on, freelancers, for, the, majority, of, their, needs, for, example, in, 2016, the, new, york, times, employed, 52, photo, editors, and, relied, on, freelancers, to, provide, 50, percent, or, more, of, its, visuals, the, wall, street, journal, employed, 24, photo, editors, and, relied, on, freelancers, for, 66, percent, of, its, features, imagery, and, 33, percent, of, its, news, imagery, the, washington, post, employed, 19, photo, editors, and, relied, on, freelancers, for, 80, percent, of, its, international, news, imagery, 50, percent, of, its, political, news, imagery, and, between, 60, and, 80, percent, of, its, national, news, imagery, the, age, of, the, citizen, journalist, and, the, providing, of, news, photos, by, amateur, bystanders, have, contributed, to, the, art, of, photojournalism, paul, levinson, attributes, this, shift, to, the, kodak, camera, one, of, the, first, cheap, and, accessible, photo, technologies, that, put, a, piece, of, visual, reality, into, every, person, s, potential, grasp, the, empowered, news, audience, with, the, advent, of, the, internet, sparked, the, creation, of, blogs, podcasts, and, online, news, independent, of, the, traditional, outlets, and, for, the, first, time, in, our, history, the, news, increasingly, is, produced, by, companies, outside, journalism, dan, chung, a, former, photojournalist, for, the,
