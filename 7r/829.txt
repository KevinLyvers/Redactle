violence, is, the, use, of, physical, force, to, cause, harm, to, people, or, non, human, life, such, as, pain, injury, death, damage, or, destruction, some, definitions, are, somewhat, broader, such, as, the, world, health, organization, s, definition, of, violence, as, the, intentional, use, of, physical, force, or, power, threatened, or, actual, against, oneself, another, person, or, against, a, group, or, community, which, either, results, in, or, has, a, high, likelihood, of, resulting, in, injury, death, psychological, harm, maldevelopment, or, deprivation, internationally, violence, resulted, in, deaths, of, an, estimated, 1, 28, million, people, in, 2013, up, from, 1, 13, million, in, 1990, however, the, global, population, grew, by, roughly, 1, 9, billion, during, those, years, showing, a, dramatic, reduction, in, violence, per, capita, of, the, deaths, in, 2013, roughly, 842, 000, were, attributed, to, self, harm, suicide, 405, 000, to, interpersonal, violence, homicide, and, 31, 000, to, collective, violence, war, and, legal, intervention, for, each, single, death, due, to, violence, there, are, dozens, of, hospitalizations, hundreds, of, emergency, department, visits, and, thousands, of, doctors, appointments, furthermore, violence, often, has, lifelong, consequences, for, physical, and, mental, health, and, social, functioning, and, can, slow, economic, and, social, development, in, 2013, of, the, estimated, 405, 000, deaths, due, to, interpersonal, violence, globally, assault, by, firearm, was, the, cause, in, 180, 000, deaths, assault, by, sharp, object, was, the, cause, in, 114, 000, deaths, and, the, remaining, 110, 000, deaths, from, other, causes, violence, in, many, forms, can, be, preventable, there, is, a, strong, relationship, between, levels, of, violence, and, modifiable, factors, in, a, country, such, as, concentrated, regional, poverty, income, and, gender, inequality, the, harmful, use, of, alcohol, and, the, absence, of, safe, stable, and, nurturing, relationships, between, children, and, parents, strategies, addressing, the, underlying, causes, of, violence, can, be, relatively, effective, in, preventing, violence, although, mental, and, physical, health, and, individual, responses, personalities, etc, have, always, been, decisive, factors, in, the, formation, of, these, behaviors, the, world, health, organization, divides, violence, into, three, broad, categories, this, initial, categorization, differentiates, between, violence, that, a, person, inflicts, upon, themself, violence, inflicted, by, another, individual, or, by, a, small, group, of, individuals, and, violence, inflicted, by, larger, groups, such, as, states, organized, political, groups, militia, groups, and, terrorist, organizations, alternatively, violence, can, primarily, be, classified, as, either, instrumental, or, reactive, hostile, self, directed, violence, is, subdivided, into, suicidal, behaviour, and, self, abuse, the, former, includes, suicidal, thoughts, attempted, suicides, also, called, para, suicide, or, deliberate, self, injury, in, some, countries, and, suicide, itself, self, abuse, in, contrast, includes, acts, such, as, self, mutilation, unlike, the, other, two, broad, categories, the, subcategories, of, collective, violence, suggest, possible, motives, for, violence, committed, by, larger, groups, of, individuals, or, by, states, collective, violence, that, is, committed, to, advance, a, particular, social, agenda, includes, for, example, crimes, of, hate, committed, by, organized, groups, terrorist, acts, and, mob, violence, political, violence, includes, war, and, related, violent, conflicts, state, violence, and, similar, acts, carried, out, by, armed, groups, there, may, be, multiple, determinants, of, violence, against, civilians, in, such, situations, economic, violence, includes, attacks, motivated, by, economic, gain, such, as, attacks, carried, out, with, the, purpose, of, disrupting, economic, activity, denying, access, to, essential, services, or, creating, economic, division, and, fragmentation, clearly, acts, committed, by, domestic, and, subnational, groups, can, have, multiple, motives, slow, violence, is, a, long, duration, form, of, violence, which, is, often, invisible, at, least, to, those, not, impacted, by, it, such, as, environmental, degradation, pollution, and, climate, change, war, is, a, state, of, prolonged, violent, large, scale, conflict, involving, two, or, more, groups, of, people, usually, under, the, auspices, of, government, it, is, the, most, extreme, form, of, collective, violence, war, is, fought, as, a, means, of, resolving, territorial, and, other, conflicts, as, war, of, aggression, to, conquer, territory, or, loot, resources, in, national, self, defence, or, liberation, or, to, suppress, attempts, of, part, of, the, nation, to, secede, from, it, there, are, also, ideological, religious, and, revolutionary, wars, since, the, industrial, revolution, the, lethality, of, modern, warfare, has, grown, world, war, i, casualties, were, over, 40, million, and, world, war, ii, casualties, were, over, 70, million, interpersonal, violence, is, divided, into, two, subcategories, family, and, intimate, partner, violence, that, is, violence, largely, between, family, members, and, intimate, partners, usually, though, not, exclusively, taking, place, in, the, home, community, violence, violence, between, individuals, who, are, unrelated, and, who, may, or, may, not, know, each, other, generally, taking, place, outside, the, home, the, former, group, includes, forms, of, violence, such, as, child, abuse, and, child, corporal, punishment, intimate, partner, violence, and, abuse, of, the, elderly, the, latter, includes, youth, violence, random, acts, of, violence, rape, or, sexual, assault, by, strangers, and, violence, in, institutional, settings, such, as, schools, workplaces, prisons, and, nursing, homes, when, interpersonal, violence, occurs, in, families, its, psychological, consequences, can, affect, parents, children, and, their, relationship, in, the, short, and, long, terms, child, maltreatment, is, the, abuse, and, neglect, that, occurs, to, children, under, 18, years, of, age, it, includes, all, types, of, physical, and, or, emotional, ill, treatment, sexual, abuse, neglect, negligence, and, commercial, or, other, child, exploitation, which, results, in, actual, or, potential, harm, to, the, child, s, health, survival, development, or, dignity, in, the, context, of, a, relationship, of, responsibility, trust, or, power, exposure, to, intimate, partner, violence, is, also, sometimes, included, as, a, form, of, child, maltreatment, child, maltreatment, is, a, global, problem, with, serious, lifelong, consequences, which, is, however, complex, and, difficult, to, study, there, are, no, reliable, global, estimates, for, the, prevalence, of, child, maltreatment, data, for, many, countries, especially, low, and, middle, income, countries, are, lacking, current, estimates, vary, widely, depending, on, the, country, and, the, method, of, research, used, approximately, 20, of, women, and, 5, 10, of, men, report, being, sexually, abused, as, children, while, 25, 50, of, all, children, report, being, physically, abused, consequences, of, child, maltreatment, include, impaired, lifelong, physical, and, mental, health, and, social, and, occupational, functioning, e, g, school, job, and, relationship, difficulties, these, can, ultimately, slow, a, country, s, economic, and, social, development, preventing, child, maltreatment, before, it, starts, is, possible, and, requires, a, multisectoral, approach, effective, prevention, programmes, support, parents, and, teach, positive, parenting, skills, ongoing, care, of, children, and, families, can, reduce, the, risk, of, maltreatment, reoccurring, and, can, minimize, its, consequences, following, the, world, health, organization, youth, are, defined, as, people, between, the, ages, of, 10, and, 29, years, youth, violence, refers, to, violence, occurring, between, youths, and, includes, acts, that, range, from, bullying, and, physical, fighting, through, more, severe, sexual, and, physical, assault, to, homicide, worldwide, some, 250, 000, homicides, occur, among, youth, 10, 29, years, of, age, each, year, which, is, 41, of, the, total, number, of, homicides, globally, each, year, global, burden, of, disease, world, health, organization, 2008, for, each, young, person, killed, 20, 40, more, sustain, injuries, requiring, hospital, treatment, youth, violence, has, a, serious, often, lifelong, impact, on, a, person, s, psychological, and, social, functioning, youth, violence, greatly, increases, the, costs, of, health, welfare, and, criminal, justice, services, reduces, productivity, decreases, the, value, of, property, and, generally, undermines, the, fabric, of, society, prevention, programmes, shown, to, be, effective, or, to, have, promise, in, reducing, youth, violence, include, life, skills, and, social, development, programmes, designed, to, help, children, and, adolescents, manage, anger, resolve, conflict, and, develop, the, necessary, social, skills, to, solve, problems, schools, based, anti, bullying, prevention, programmes, and, programmes, to, reduce, access, to, alcohol, illegal, drugs, and, guns, also, given, significant, neighbourhood, effects, on, youth, violence, interventions, involving, relocating, families, to, less, poor, environments, have, shown, promising, results, similarly, urban, renewal, projects, such, as, business, improvement, districts, have, shown, a, reduction, in, youth, violence, different, types, of, youth, on, youth, violence, include, witnessing, or, being, involved, in, physical, emotional, and, sexual, abuse, e, g, physical, attacks, bullying, rape, and, violent, acts, like, gang, shootings, and, robberies, according, to, researchers, in, 2018, more, than, half, of, children, and, adolescents, living, in, cities, have, experienced, some, form, of, community, violence, the, violence, can, also, all, take, place, under, one, roof, or, in, a, given, community, or, neighborhood, and, can, happen, at, the, same, time, or, at, different, stages, of, life, youth, violence, has, immediate, and, long, term, adverse, impact, whether, the, individual, was, the, recipient, of, the, violence, or, a, witness, to, it, youth, violence, impacts, individuals, their, families, and, society, victims, can, have, lifelong, injuries, which, means, ongoing, doctor, and, hospital, visits, the, cost, of, which, quickly, add, up, since, the, victims, of, youth, on, youth, violence, may, not, be, able, to, attend, school, or, work, because, of, their, physical, and, or, mental, injuries, it, is, often, up, to, their, family, members, to, take, care, of, them, including, paying, their, daily, living, expenses, and, medical, bills, their, caretakers, may, have, to, give, up, their, jobs, or, work, reduced, hours, to, provide, help, to, the, victim, of, violence, this, causes, a, further, burden, on, society, because, the, victim, and, maybe, even, their, caretakers, have, to, obtain, government, assistance, to, help, pay, their, bills, recent, research, has, found, that, psychological, trauma, during, childhood, can, change, a, child, s, brain, trauma, is, known, to, physically, affect, the, brain, and, the, body, which, causes, anxiety, rage, and, the, ability, to, concentrate, they, can, also, have, problems, remembering, trusting, and, forming, relationships, since, the, brain, becomes, used, to, violence, it, may, stay, continually, in, an, alert, state, similar, to, being, stuck, in, the, fight, or, flight, mode, researchers, claim, that, the, youth, who, are, exposed, to, violence, may, have, emotional, social, and, cognitive, problems, they, may, have, trouble, controlling, emotions, paying, attention, in, school, withdraw, from, friends, or, show, signs, of, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, it, is, important, for, youth, exposed, to, violence, to, understand, how, their, bodies, may, react, so, they, can, take, positive, steps, to, counteract, any, possible, short, and, long, term, negative, effects, e, g, poor, concentration, feelings, of, depression, heightened, levels, of, anxiety, by, taking, immediate, steps, to, mitigate, the, effects, of, the, trauma, they, ve, experienced, negative, repercussions, can, be, reduced, or, eliminated, as, an, initial, step, the, youths, need, to, understand, why, they, may, be, feeling, a, certain, way, and, to, understand, how, the, violence, they, have, experienced, may, be, causing, negative, feelings, and, making, them, behave, differently, pursuing, a, greater, awareness, of, their, feelings, perceptions, and, negative, emotions, is, the, first, step, that, should, be, taken, as, part, of, recovering, from, the, trauma, they, have, experienced, neuroscience, research, shows, that, the, only, way, we, can, change, the, way, we, feel, is, by, becoming, aware, of, our, inner, experience, and, learning, to, befriend, what, is, going, on, inside, ourselves, some, of, the, ways, to, combat, the, adverse, effects, of, exposure, to, youth, violence, would, be, to, try, various, mindfulness, and, movement, activities, deep, breathing, exercises, and, other, actions, that, enable, youths, to, release, their, pent, up, emotions, using, these, techniques, will, teach, body, awareness, reduce, anxiety, and, nervousness, and, reduce, feelings, of, anger, and, annoyance, youth, who, have, experienced, violence, benefit, from, having, a, close, relationship, with, one, or, more, people, this, is, important, because, the, trauma, victims, need, to, have, people, who, are, safe, and, trustworthy, that, they, can, relate, and, talk, to, about, their, horrible, experiences, some, youth, do, not, have, adult, figures, at, home, or, someone, they, can, count, on, for, guidance, and, comfort, schools, in, bad, neighborhoods, where, youth, violence, is, prevalent, should, assign, counselors, to, each, student, so, that, they, receive, regular, guidance, in, addition, to, counseling, therapy, sessions, and, programs, it, has, been, recommended, that, schools, offer, mentoring, programs, where, students, can, interact, with, adults, who, can, be, a, positive, influence, on, them, another, way, is, to, create, more, neighborhood, programs, to, ensure, that, each, child, has, a, positive, and, stable, place, to, go, when, school, in, not, in, session, many, children, have, benefited, from, formal, organizations, now, which, aim, to, help, mentor, and, provide, a, safe, environment, for, the, youth, especially, those, living, in, neighborhoods, with, higher, rates, of, violence, this, includes, organizations, such, as, becoming, a, man, ceasefire, illinois, chicago, area, project, little, black, pearl, and, rainbow, house, these, programs, are, designed, to, help, give, the, youth, a, safe, place, to, go, stop, the, violence, from, occurring, offering, counseling, and, mentoring, to, help, stop, the, cycle, of, violence, if, the, youth, do, not, have, a, safe, place, to, go, after, school, hours, they, will, likely, get, into, trouble, receive, poor, grades, drop, out, of, school, and, use, drugs, and, alcohol, the, gangs, look, for, youth, who, do, not, have, positive, influences, in, their, life, and, need, protection, this, is, why, these, programs, are, so, important, for, the, youth, to, have, a, safe, environment, rather, than, resorting, to, the, streets, population, level, surveys, based, on, reports, from, victims, provide, the, most, accurate, estimates, of, the, prevalence, of, intimate, partner, violence, and, sexual, violence, in, non, conflict, settings, a, study, conducted, by, who, in, 10, mainly, developing, countries, found, that, among, women, aged, 15, to, 49, years, between, 15, japan, and, 70, ethiopia, and, peru, of, women, reported, physical, and, or, sexual, violence, by, an, intimate, partner, a, growing, body, of, research, on, men, and, intimate, partner, violence, focuses, on, men, as, both, perpetrators, and, victims, of, violence, as, well, as, on, how, to, involve, men, and, boys, in, anti, violence, work, intimate, partner, and, sexual, violence, have, serious, short, and, long, term, physical, mental, sexual, and, reproductive, health, problems, for, victims, and, for, their, children, and, lead, to, high, social, and, economic, costs, these, include, both, fatal, and, non, fatal, injuries, depression, and, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, unintended, pregnancies, sexually, transmitted, infections, including, hiv, factors, associated, with, the, perpetration, and, experiencing, of, intimate, partner, violence, are, low, levels, of, education, history, of, violence, as, a, perpetrator, a, victim, or, a, witness, of, parental, violence, harmful, use, of, alcohol, attitudes, that, are, accepting, of, violence, as, well, as, marital, discord, and, dissatisfaction, factors, associated, only, with, perpetration, of, intimate, partner, violence, are, having, multiple, partners, and, antisocial, personality, disorder, a, recent, theory, named, the, criminal, spin, suggests, a, mutual, flywheel, effect, between, partners, that, is, manifested, by, an, escalation, in, the, violence, a, violent, spin, may, occur, in, any, other, forms, of, violence, but, in, intimate, partner, violence, the, added, value, is, the, mutual, spin, based, on, the, unique, situation, and, characteristics, of, intimate, relationship, the, primary, prevention, strategy, with, the, best, evidence, for, effectiveness, for, intimate, partner, violence, is, school, based, programming, for, adolescents, to, prevent, violence, within, dating, relationships, evidence, is, emerging, for, the, effectiveness, of, several, other, primary, prevention, strategies, those, that, combine, microfinance, with, gender, equality, training, promote, communication, and, relationship, skills, within, communities, reduce, access, to, and, the, harmful, use, of, alcohol, and, change, cultural, gender, norms, sexual, violence, is, any, sexual, act, attempt, to, obtain, a, sexual, act, unwanted, sexual, comments, or, advances, or, acts, to, traffic, or, otherwise, directed, against, a, person, s, sexuality, using, coercion, by, any, person, regardless, of, their, relationship, to, the, victim, in, any, setting, it, includes, rape, defined, as, the, physically, forced, or, otherwise, coerced, penetration, of, the, vulva, or, anus, with, a, penis, other, body, part, or, object, population, level, surveys, based, on, reports, from, victims, estimate, that, between, 0, 3, and, 11, 5, of, women, reported, experiencing, sexual, violence, sexual, violence, has, serious, short, and, long, term, consequences, on, physical, mental, sexual, and, reproductive, health, for, victims, and, for, their, children, as, described, in, the, section, on, intimate, partner, violence, if, perpetrated, during, childhood, sexual, violence, can, lead, to, increased, smoking, drug, and, alcohol, misuse, and, risky, sexual, behaviors, in, later, life, it, is, also, associated, with, perpetration, of, violence, and, being, a, victim, of, violence, many, of, the, risk, factors, for, sexual, violence, are, the, same, as, for, domestic, violence, risk, factors, specific, to, sexual, violence, perpetration, include, beliefs, in, family, honor, and, sexual, purity, ideologies, of, male, sexual, entitlement, and, weak, legal, sanctions, for, sexual, violence, few, interventions, to, prevent, sexual, violence, have, been, demonstrated, to, be, effective, school, based, programmes, to, prevent, child, sexual, abuse, by, teaching, children, to, recognize, and, avoid, potentially, sexually, abusive, situations, are, run, in, many, parts, of, the, world, and, appear, promising, but, require, further, research, to, achieve, lasting, change, it, is, important, to, enact, legislation, and, develop, policies, that, protect, women, address, discrimination, against, women, and, promote, gender, equality, and, help, to, move, the, culture, away, from, violence, elder, maltreatment, is, a, single, or, repeated, act, or, lack, of, appropriate, action, occurring, within, any, relationship, where, there, is, an, expectation, of, trust, which, causes, harm, or, distress, to, an, older, person, while, there, is, little, information, regarding, the, extent, of, maltreatment, in, elderly, populations, especially, in, developing, countries, it, is, estimated, that, 4, 6, of, elderly, people, in, high, income, countries, have, experienced, some, form, of, maltreatment, at, home, however, older, people, are, often, afraid, to, report, cases, of, maltreatment, to, family, friends, or, to, the, authorities, data, on, the, extent, of, the, problem, in, institutions, such, as, hospitals, nursing, homes, and, other, long, term, care, facilities, are, scarce, elder, maltreatment, can, lead, to, serious, physical, injuries, and, long, term, psychological, consequences, elder, maltreatment, is, predicted, to, increase, as, many, countries, are, experiencing, rapidly, ageing, populations, many, strategies, have, been, implemented, to, prevent, elder, maltreatment, and, to, take, action, against, it, and, mitigate, its, consequences, including, public, and, professional, awareness, campaigns, screening, of, potential, victims, and, abusers, caregiver, support, interventions, e, g, stress, management, respite, care, adult, protective, services, and, self, help, groups, their, effectiveness, has, however, not, so, far, been, well, established, several, rare, but, painful, episodes, of, assassination, attempted, assassination, and, school, shootings, at, elementary, middle, high, schools, as, well, as, colleges, and, universities, in, the, united, states, led, to, a, considerable, body, of, research, on, ascertainable, behaviors, of, persons, who, have, planned, or, carried, out, such, attacks, these, studies, 1995, 2002, investigated, what, the, authors, called, targeted, violence, described, the, path, to, violence, of, those, who, planned, or, carried, out, attacks, and, laid, out, suggestions, for, law, enforcement, and, educators, a, major, point, from, these, research, studies, is, that, targeted, violence, does, not, just, come, out, of, the, blue, as, an, anthropological, concept, everyday, violence, may, refer, to, the, incorporation, of, different, forms, of, violence, mainly, political, violence, into, daily, practices, latin, america, and, the, caribbean, the, region, with, the, highest, murder, rate, in, the, world, experienced, more, than, 2, 5, million, murders, between, 2000, and, 2017, some, philosophers, have, argued, that, any, interpretation, of, reality, is, intrinsically, violent, slavoj, i, ek, in, his, book, violence, stated, that, something, violent, is, the, very, symbolization, of, a, thing, an, ontological, perspective, considers, the, harm, inflicted, by, the, very, interpretation, of, the, world, as, a, form, of, violence, that, is, distinct, from, physical, violence, in, that, it, is, possible, to, avoid, physical, violence, whereas, some, ontological, violence, is, intrinsic, to, all, knowledge, both, foucault, and, arendt, considered, the, relationship, between, power, and, violence, but, concluded, that, while, related, they, are, distinct, 46, in, feminist, philosophy, epistemic, violence, is, the, act, of, causing, harm, by, an, inability, to, understand, the, conversation, of, others, due, to, ignorance, some, philosophers, think, this, will, harm, marginalized, groups, brad, evans, states, that, violence, represents, a, violation, in, the, very, conditions, constituting, what, it, means, to, be, human, as, such, is, always, an, attack, upon, a, person, s, dignity, their, sense, of, selfhood, and, their, future, and, is, both, an, ontological, crime, and, a, form, of, political, ruination, violence, cannot, be, attributed, to, solely, protective, factors, or, risk, factors, both, of, these, factor, groups, are, equally, important, in, the, prevention, intervention, and, treatment, of, violence, as, a, whole, the, cdc, outlines, several, risk, and, protective, factors, for, youth, violence, at, the, individual, family, social, and, community, levels, individual, risk, factors, include, poor, behavioral, control, high, emotional, stress, low, iq, and, antisocial, beliefs, or, attitudes, family, risk, factors, include, authoritarian, childrearing, attitudes, inconsistent, disciplinary, practices, low, emotional, attachment, to, parents, or, caregivers, and, low, parental, income, and, involvement, social, risk, factors, include, social, rejection, poor, academic, performance, and, commitment, to, school, and, gang, involvement, or, association, with, delinquent, peers, community, risk, factors, include, poverty, low, community, participation, and, diminished, economic, opportunities, on, the, other, hand, individual, protective, factors, include, an, intolerance, towards, deviance, higher, iq, and, gpa, elevated, popularity, and, social, skills, as, well, as, religious, beliefs, family, protective, factors, include, a, connectedness, and, ability, to, discuss, issues, with, family, members, or, adults, parent, family, use, of, constructive, coping, strategies, and, consistent, parental, presence, during, at, least, one, of, the, following, when, awakening, when, arriving, home, from, school, at, dinner, time, or, when, going, to, bed, social, protective, factors, include, quality, school, relationships, close, relationships, with, non, deviant, peers, involvement, in, prosocial, activities, and, exposure, to, school, climates, that, are, well, supervised, use, clear, behavior, rules, and, disciplinary, approaches, and, engage, parents, with, teachers, with, many, conceptual, factors, that, occur, at, varying, levels, in, the, lives, of, those, impacted, the, exact, causes, of, violence, are, complex, to, represent, this, complexity, the, ecological, or, social, ecological, model, is, often, used, the, following, four, level, version, of, the, ecological, model, is, often, used, in, the, study, of, violence, the, first, level, identifies, biological, and, personal, factors, that, influence, how, individuals, behave, and, increase, their, likelihood, of, becoming, a, victim, or, perpetrator, of, violence, demographic, characteristics, age, education, income, genetics, brain, lesions, personality, disorders, substance, abuse, and, a, history, of, experiencing, witnessing, or, engaging, in, violent, behaviour, the, second, level, focuses, on, close, relationships, such, as, those, with, family, and, friends, in, youth, violence, for, example, having, friends, who, engage, in, or, encourage, violence, can, increase, a, young, person, s, risk, of, being, a, victim, or, perpetrator, of, violence, for, intimate, partner, violence, a, consistent, marker, at, this, level, of, the, model, is, marital, conflict, or, discord, in, the, relationship, in, elder, abuse, important, factors, are, stress, due, to, the, nature, of, the, past, relationship, between, the, abused, person, and, the, care, giver, the, third, level, explores, the, community, context, i, e, schools, workplaces, and, neighbourhoods, risk, at, this, level, may, be, affected, by, factors, such, as, the, existence, of, a, local, drug, trade, the, absence, of, social, networks, and, concentrated, poverty, all, these, factors, have, been, shown, to, be, important, in, several, types, of, violence, finally, the, fourth, level, looks, at, the, broad, societal, factors, that, help, to, create, a, climate, in, which, violence, is, encouraged, or, inhibited, the, responsiveness, of, the, criminal, justice, system, social, and, cultural, norms, regarding, gender, roles, or, parent, child, relationships, income, inequality, the, strength, of, the, social, welfare, system, the, social, acceptability, of, violence, the, availability, of, weapons, the, exposure, to, violence, in, mass, media, and, political, instability, while, studies, showing, associations, between, physical, punishment, of, children, and, later, aggression, cannot, prove, that, physical, punishment, causes, an, increase, in, aggression, a, number, of, longitudinal, studies, suggest, that, the, experience, of, physical, punishment, has, a, direct, causal, effect, on, later, aggressive, behaviors, cross, cultural, studies, have, shown, that, greater, prevalence, of, corporal, punishment, of, children, tends, to, predict, higher, levels, of, violence, in, societies, for, instance, a, 2005, analysis, of, 186, pre, industrial, societies, found, that, corporal, punishment, was, more, prevalent, in, societies, which, also, had, higher, rates, of, homicide, assault, and, war, in, the, united, states, domestic, corporal, punishment, has, been, linked, to, later, violent, acts, against, family, members, and, spouses, the, american, family, violence, researcher, murray, a, straus, believes, that, disciplinary, spanking, forms, the, most, prevalent, and, important, form, of, violence, in, american, families, whose, effects, contribute, to, several, major, societal, problems, including, later, domestic, violence, and, crime, the, causes, of, violent, behavior, in, people, are, often, a, topic, of, research, in, psychology, neurobiologist, jan, vodka, emphasizes, that, for, those, purposes, violent, behavior, is, defined, as, overt, and, intentional, physically, aggressive, behavior, against, another, person, based, on, the, idea, of, human, nature, scientists, do, agree, violence, is, inherent, in, humans, among, prehistoric, humans, there, is, archaeological, evidence, for, both, contentions, of, violence, and, peacefulness, as, primary, characteristics, since, violence, is, a, matter, of, perception, as, well, as, a, measurable, phenomenon, psychologists, have, found, variability, in, whether, people, perceive, certain, physical, acts, as, violent, for, example, in, a, state, where, execution, is, a, legalized, punishment, we, do, not, typically, perceive, the, executioner, as, violent, though, we, may, talk, in, a, more, metaphorical, way, of, the, state, acting, violently, likewise, understandings, of, violence, are, linked, to, a, perceived, aggressor, victim, relationship, hence, psychologists, have, shown, that, people, may, not, recognise, defensive, use, of, force, as, violent, even, in, cases, where, the, amount, of, force, used, is, significantly, greater, than, in, the, original, aggression, the, concept, of, violence, normalization, is, known, as, socially, sanctioned, or, structural, violence, and, is, a, topic, of, increasing, interest, to, researchers, trying, to, understand, violent, behavior, it, has, been, discussed, at, length, by, researchers, in, sociology, medical, anthropology, psychology, psychiatry, philosophy, and, bioarchaeology, evolutionary, psychology, offers, several, explanations, for, human, violence, in, various, contexts, such, as, sexual, jealousy, in, humans, child, abuse, and, homicide, goetz, 2010, argues, that, humans, are, similar, to, most, mammal, species, and, use, violence, in, specific, situations, he, writes, that, buss, and, shackelford, 1997a, proposed, seven, adaptive, problems, our, ancestors, recurrently, faced, that, might, have, been, solved, by, aggression, co, opting, the, resources, of, others, defending, against, attack, inflicting, costs, on, same, sex, rivals, negotiating, status, and, hierarchies, deterring, rivals, from, future, aggression, deterring, mate, from, infidelity, and, reducing, resources, expended, on, genetically, unrelated, children, goetz, writes, that, most, homicides, seem, to, start, from, relatively, trivial, disputes, between, unrelated, men, who, then, escalate, to, violence, and, death, he, argues, that, such, conflicts, occur, when, there, is, a, status, dispute, between, men, of, relatively, similar, status, if, there, is, a, great, initial, status, difference, then, the, lower, status, individual, usually, offers, no, challenge, and, if, challenged, the, higher, status, individual, usually, ignores, the, lower, status, individual, at, the, same, an, environment, of, great, inequalities, between, people, may, cause, those, at, the, bottom, to, use, more, violence, in, attempts, to, gain, status, research, into, the, media, and, violence, examines, whether, links, between, consuming, media, violence, and, subsequent, aggressive, and, violent, behaviour, exists, although, some, scholars, had, claimed, media, violence, may, increase, aggression, this, view, is, coming, increasingly, in, doubt, both, in, the, scholarly, community, and, was, rejected, by, the, us, supreme, court, in, the, brown, v, ema, case, as, well, as, in, a, review, of, video, game, violence, by, the, australian, government, 2010, which, concluded, evidence, for, harmful, effects, were, inconclusive, at, best, and, the, rhetoric, of, some, scholars, was, not, matched, by, good, data, despite, public, or, media, opinion, national, studies, have, indicated, that, severe, mental, illness, does, not, independently, predict, future, violent, behavior, on, average, and, is, not, a, leading, cause, of, violence, in, society, there, is, a, statistical, association, with, various, factors, that, do, relate, to, violence, in, anyone, such, as, substance, use, and, various, personal, social, and, economic, factors, a, 2015, review, found, that, in, the, united, states, about, 4, of, violence, is, attributable, to, people, diagnosed, with, mental, illness, and, a, 2014, study, found, that, 7, 5, of, crimes, committed, by, mentally, ill, people, were, directly, related, to, the, symptoms, of, their, mental, illness, the, majority, of, people, with, serious, mental, illness, are, never, violent, in, fact, findings, consistently, indicate, that, it, is, many, times, more, likely, that, people, diagnosed, with, a, serious, mental, illness, living, in, the, community, will, be, the, victims, rather, than, the, perpetrators, of, violence, in, a, study, of, individuals, diagnosed, with, severe, mental, illness, living, in, a, us, inner, city, area, a, quarter, were, found, to, have, been, victims, of, at, least, one, violent, crime, over, the, course, of, a, year, a, proportion, eleven, times, higher, than, the, inner, city, average, and, higher, in, every, category, of, crime, including, violent, assaults, and, theft, people, with, a, diagnosis, may, find, it, more, difficult, to, secure, prosecutions, however, due, in, part, to, prejudice, and, being, seen, as, less, credible, however, there, are, some, specific, diagnoses, such, as, childhood, conduct, disorder, or, adult, antisocial, personality, disorder, or, psychopathy, which, are, defined, by, or, are, inherently, associated, with, conduct, problems, and, violence, there, are, conflicting, findings, about, the, extent, to, which, certain, specific, symptoms, notably, some, kinds, of, psychosis, hallucinations, or, delusions, that, can, occur, in, disorders, such, as, schizophrenia, delusional, disorder, or, mood, disorder, are, linked, to, an, increased, risk, of, serious, violence, on, average, the, mediating, factors, of, violent, acts, however, are, most, consistently, found, to, be, mainly, socio, demographic, and, socio, economic, factors, such, as, being, young, male, of, lower, socioeconomic, status, and, in, particular, substance, use, including, alcohol, use, to, which, some, people, may, be, particularly, vulnerable, the, threat, and, enforcement, of, physical, punishment, has, been, a, tried, and, tested, method, of, preventing, some, violence, since, civilisation, began, it, is, used, in, various, degrees, in, most, countries, cities, and, counties, throughout, the, united, states, organize, violence, prevention, months, where, the, mayor, by, proclamation, or, the, county, by, a, resolution, encourage, the, private, community, and, public, sectors, to, engage, in, activities, that, raise, awareness, that, violence, is, not, acceptable, through, art, music, lectures, and, events, for, example, violence, prevention, month, coordinator, karen, earle, lile, in, contra, costa, county, california, created, a, wall, of, life, where, children, drew, pictures, that, were, put, up, in, the, walls, of, banks, and, public, spaces, displaying, a, child, s, view, of, violence, they, had, witnessed, and, how, it, affected, them, in, an, effort, to, draw, attention, to, how, violence, affects, the, community, not, just, the, people, involved, a, review, of, scientific, literature, by, the, world, health, organization, on, the, effectiveness, of, strategies, to, prevent, interpersonal, violence, identified, the, seven, strategies, below, as, being, supported, by, either, strong, or, emerging, evidence, for, effectiveness, these, strategies, target, risk, factors, at, all, four, levels, of, the, ecological, model, among, the, most, effective, such, programmes, to, prevent, child, maltreatment, and, reduce, childhood, aggression, are, the, nurse, family, partnership, home, visiting, programme, and, the, triple, p, parenting, program, there, is, also, emerging, evidence, that, these, programmes, reduce, convictions, and, violent, acts, in, adolescence, and, early, adulthood, and, probably, help, decrease, intimate, partner, violence, and, self, directed, violence, in, later, life, evidence, shows, that, the, life, skills, acquired, in, social, development, programmes, can, reduce, involvement, in, violence, improve, social, skills, boost, educational, achievement, and, improve, job, prospects, life, skills, refer, to, social, emotional, and, behavioural, competencies, which, help, children, and, adolescents, effectively, deal, with, the, challenges, of, everyday, life, evaluation, studies, are, beginning, to, support, community, interventions, that, aim, to, prevent, violence, against, women, by, promoting, gender, equality, for, instance, evidence, suggests, that, programmes, that, combine, microfinance, with, gender, equity, training, can, reduce, intimate, partner, violence, school, based, programmes, such, as, safe, dates, programme, in, the, united, states, of, america, and, the, youth, relationship, project, in, canada, have, been, found, to, be, effective, for, reducing, dating, violence, rules, or, expectations, of, behaviour, norms, within, a, cultural, or, social, group, can, encourage, violence, interventions, that, challenge, cultural, and, social, norms, supportive, of, violence, can, prevent, acts, of, violence, and, have, been, widely, used, but, the, evidence, base, for, their, effectiveness, is, currently, weak, the, effectiveness, of, interventions, addressing, dating, violence, and, sexual, abuse, among, teenagers, and, young, adults, by, challenging, social, and, cultural, norms, related, to, gender, is, supported, by, some, evidence, interventions, to, identify, victims, of, interpersonal, violence, and, provide, effective, care, and, support, are, critical, for, protecting, health, and, breaking, cycles, of, violence, from, one, generation, to, the, next, examples, for, which, evidence, of, effectiveness, is, emerging, includes, screening, tools, to, identify, victims, of, intimate, partner, violence, and, refer, them, to, appropriate, services, psychosocial, interventions, such, as, trauma, focused, cognitive, behavioural, therapy, to, reduce, mental, health, problems, associated, with, violence, including, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, and, protection, orders, which, prohibit, a, perpetrator, from, contacting, the, victim, to, reduce, repeat, victimization, among, victims, of, intimate, partner, violence, not, surprisingly, scientific, evidence, about, the, effectiveness, of, interventions, to, prevent, collective, violence, is, lacking, however, policies, that, facilitate, reductions, in, poverty, that, make, decision, making, more, accountable, that, reduce, inequalities, between, groups, as, well, as, policies, that, reduce, access, to, biological, chemical, nuclear, and, other, weapons, have, been, recommended, when, planning, responses, to, violent, conflicts, recommended, approaches, include, assessing, at, an, early, stage, who, is, most, vulnerable, and, what, their, needs, are, co, ordination, of, activities, between, various, players, and, working, towards, global, national, and, local, capabilities, so, as, to, deliver, effective, health, services, during, the, various, stages, of, an, emergency, one, of, the, main, functions, of, law, is, to, regulate, violence, sociologist, max, weber, stated, that, the, state, claims, the, monopoly, of, the, legitimate, use, of, force, to, cause, harm, practised, within, the, confines, of, a, specific, territory, law, enforcement, is, the, main, means, of, regulating, nonmilitary, violence, in, society, governments, regulate, the, use, of, violence, through, legal, systems, governing, individuals, and, political, authorities, including, the, police, and, military, civil, societies, authorize, some, amount, of, violence, exercised, through, the, police, power, to, maintain, the, status, quo, and, enforce, laws, however, german, political, theorist, hannah, arendt, noted, violence, can, be, justifiable, but, it, never, will, be, legitimate, its, justification, loses, in, plausibility, the, farther, its, intended, end, recedes, into, the, future, no, one, questions, the, use, of, violence, in, self, defence, because, the, danger, is, not, only, clear, but, also, present, and, the, end, justifying, the, means, is, immediate, arendt, made, a, clear, distinction, between, violence, and, power, most, political, theorists, regarded, violence, as, an, extreme, manifestation, of, power, whereas, arendt, regarded, the, two, concepts, as, opposites, in, the, 20th, century, in, acts, of, democide, governments, may, have, killed, more, than, 260, million, of, their, own, people, through, police, brutality, execution, massacre, slave, labour, camps, and, sometimes, through, intentional, famine, violent, acts, that, are, not, carried, out, by, the, military, or, police, and, that, are, not, in, self, defense, are, usually, classified, as, crimes, although, not, all, crimes, are, violent, crimes, the, federal, bureau, of, investigation, fbi, classifies, violence, resulting, in, homicide, into, criminal, homicide, and, justifiable, homicide, e, g, self, defense, the, criminal, justice, approach, sees, its, main, task, as, enforcing, laws, that, proscribe, violence, and, ensuring, that, justice, is, done, the, notions, of, individual, blame, responsibility, guilt, and, culpability, are, central, to, criminal, justice, s, approach, to, violence, and, one, of, the, criminal, justice, system, s, main, tasks, is, to, do, justice, i, e, to, ensure, that, offenders, are, properly, identified, that, the, degree, of, their, guilt, is, as, accurately, ascertained, as, possible, and, that, they, are, punished, appropriately, to, prevent, and, respond, to, violence, the, criminal, justice, approach, relies, primarily, on, deterrence, incarceration, and, the, punishment, and, rehabilitation, of, perpetrators, the, criminal, justice, approach, beyond, justice, and, punishment, has, traditionally, emphasized, indicated, interventions, aimed, at, those, who, have, already, been, involved, in, violence, either, as, victims, or, as, perpetrators, one, of, the, main, reasons, offenders, are, arrested, prosecuted, and, convicted, is, to, prevent, further, crimes, through, deterrence, threatening, potential, offenders, with, criminal, sanctions, if, they, commit, crimes, incapacitation, physically, preventing, offenders, from, committing, further, crimes, by, locking, them, up, and, through, rehabilitation, using, time, spent, under, state, supervision, to, develop, skills, or, change, one, s, psychological, make, up, to, reduce, the, likelihood, of, future, offences, in, recent, decades, in, many, countries, in, the, world, the, criminal, justice, system, has, taken, an, increasing, interest, in, preventing, violence, before, it, occurs, for, instance, much, of, community, and, problem, oriented, policing, aims, to, reduce, crime, and, violence, by, altering, the, conditions, that, foster, it, and, not, to, increase, the, number, of, arrests, indeed, some, police, leaders, have, gone, so, far, as, to, say, the, police, should, primarily, be, a, crime, prevention, agency, juvenile, justice, systems, an, important, component, of, criminal, justice, systems, are, largely, based, on, the, belief, in, rehabilitation, and, prevention, in, the, us, the, criminal, justice, system, has, for, instance, funded, school, and, community, based, initiatives, to, reduce, children, s, access, to, guns, and, teach, conflict, resolution, despite, this, force, is, used, routinely, against, juveniles, by, police, in, 1974, the, us, department, of, justice, assumed, primary, responsibility, for, delinquency, prevention, programmes, and, created, the, office, of, juvenile, justice, and, delinquency, prevention, which, has, supported, the, blueprints, for, violence, prevention, programme, at, the, university, of, colorado, boulder, the, public, health, approach, is, a, science, driven, population, based, interdisciplinary, intersectoral, approach, based, on, the, ecological, model, which, emphasizes, primary, prevention, rather, than, focusing, on, individuals, the, public, health, approach, aims, to, provide, the, maximum, benefit, for, the, largest, number, of, people, and, to, extend, better, care, and, safety, to, entire, populations, the, public, health, approach, is, interdisciplinary, drawing, upon, knowledge, from, many, disciplines, including, medicine, epidemiology, sociology, psychology, criminology, education, and, economics, because, all, forms, of, violence, are, multi, faceted, problems, the, public, health, approach, emphasizes, a, multi, sectoral, response, it, has, been, proved, time, and, again, that, cooperative, efforts, from, such, diverse, sectors, as, health, education, social, welfare, and, criminal, justice, are, often, necessary, to, solve, what, are, usually, assumed, to, be, purely, criminal, or, medical, problems, the, public, health, approach, considers, that, violence, rather, than, being, the, result, of, any, single, factor, is, the, outcome, of, multiple, risk, factors, and, causes, interacting, at, four, levels, of, a, nested, hierarchy, individual, close, relationship, family, community, and, wider, society, of, the, social, ecological, model, from, a, public, health, perspective, prevention, strategies, can, be, classified, into, three, types, a, public, health, approach, emphasizes, the, primary, prevention, of, violence, i, e, stopping, them, from, occurring, in, the, first, place, until, recently, this, approach, has, been, relatively, neglected, in, the, field, with, the, majority, of, resources, directed, towards, secondary, or, tertiary, prevention, perhaps, the, most, critical, element, of, a, public, health, approach, to, prevention, is, the, ability, to, identify, underlying, causes, rather, than, focusing, upon, more, visible, symptoms, this, allows, for, the, development, and, testing, of, effective, approaches, to, address, the, underlying, causes, and, so, improve, health, the, public, health, approach, is, an, evidence, based, and, systematic, process, involving, the, following, four, steps, in, many, countries, violence, prevention, is, still, a, new, or, emerging, field, in, public, health, the, public, health, community, has, started, only, recently, to, realize, the, contributions, it, can, make, to, reducing, violence, and, mitigating, its, consequences, in, 1949, gordon, called, for, injury, prevention, efforts, to, be, based, on, the, understanding, of, causes, in, a, similar, way, to, prevention, efforts, for, communicable, and, other, diseases, in, 1962, gomez, referring, to, the, who, definition, of, health, stated, that, it, is, obvious, that, violence, does, not, contribute, to, extending, life, or, to, a, complete, state, of, well, being, he, defined, violence, as, an, issue, that, public, health, experts, needed, to, address, and, stated, that, it, should, not, be, the, primary, domain, of, lawyers, military, personnel, or, politicians, however, it, is, only, in, the, last, 30, years, that, public, health, has, begun, to, address, violence, and, only, in, the, last, fifteen, has, it, done, so, at, the, global, level, this, is, a, much, shorter, period, of, time, than, public, health, has, been, tackling, other, health, problems, of, comparable, magnitude, and, with, similarly, severe, lifelong, consequences, the, global, public, health, response, to, interpersonal, violence, began, in, earnest, in, the, mid, 1990s, in, 1996, the, world, health, assembly, adopted, resolution, wha49, 25, which, declared, violence, a, leading, worldwide, public, health, problem, and, requested, that, the, world, health, organization, who, initiate, public, health, activities, to, 1, document, and, characterize, the, burden, of, violence, 2, assess, the, effectiveness, of, programmes, with, particular, attention, to, women, and, children, and, community, based, initiatives, and, 3, promote, activities, to, tackle, the, problem, at, the, international, and, national, levels, the, world, health, organization, s, initial, response, to, this, resolution, was, to, create, the, department, of, violence, and, injury, prevention, and, disability, and, to, publish, the, world, report, on, violence, and, health, 2002, the, case, for, the, public, health, sector, addressing, interpersonal, violence, rests, on, four, main, arguments, first, the, significant, amount, of, time, health, care, professionals, dedicate, to, caring, for, victims, and, perpetrators, of, violence, has, made, them, familiar, with, the, problem, and, has, led, many, particularly, in, emergency, departments, to, mobilize, to, address, it, the, information, resources, and, infrastructures, the, health, care, sector, has, at, its, disposal, are, an, important, asset, for, research, and, prevention, work, second, the, magnitude, of, the, problem, and, its, potentially, severe, lifelong, consequences, and, high, costs, to, individuals, and, wider, society, call, for, population, level, interventions, typical, of, the, public, health, approach, third, the, criminal, justice, approach, the, other, main, approach, to, addressing, violence, link, to, entry, above, has, traditionally, been, more, geared, towards, violence, that, occurs, between, male, youths, and, adults, in, the, street, and, other, public, places, which, makes, up, the, bulk, of, homicides, in, most, countries, than, towards, violence, occurring, in, private, settings, such, as, child, maltreatment, intimate, partner, violence, and, elder, abuse, which, makes, up, the, largest, share, of, non, fatal, violence, fourth, evidence, is, beginning, to, accumulate, that, a, science, based, public, health, approach, is, effective, at, preventing, interpersonal, violence, the, human, rights, approach, is, based, on, the, obligations, of, states, to, respect, protect, and, fulfill, human, rights, and, therefore, to, prevent, eradicate, and, punish, violence, it, recognizes, violence, as, a, violation, of, many, human, rights, the, rights, to, life, liberty, autonomy, and, security, of, the, person, the, rights, to, equality, and, non, discrimination, the, rights, to, be, free, from, torture, and, cruel, inhuman, and, degrading, treatment, or, punishment, the, right, to, privacy, and, the, right, to, the, highest, attainable, standard, of, health, these, human, rights, are, enshrined, in, international, and, regional, treaties, and, national, constitutions, and, laws, which, stipulate, the, obligations, of, states, and, include, mechanisms, to, hold, states, accountable, the, convention, on, the, elimination, of, all, forms, of, discrimination, against, women, for, example, requires, that, countries, party, to, the, convention, take, all, appropriate, steps, to, end, violence, against, women, the, convention, on, the, rights, of, the, child, in, its, article, 19, states, that, states, parties, shall, take, all, appropriate, legislative, administrative, social, and, educational, measures, to, protect, the, child, from, all, forms, of, physical, or, mental, violence, injury, or, abuse, neglect, or, negligent, treatment, maltreatment, or, exploitation, including, sexual, abuse, while, in, the, care, of, parent, s, legal, guardian, s, or, any, other, person, who, has, the, care, of, the, child, violence, as, defined, in, the, dictionary, of, human, geography, appears, whenever, power, is, in, jeopardy, and, in, and, of, itself, stands, emptied, of, strength, and, purpose, it, is, part, of, a, larger, matrix, of, socio, political, power, struggles, violence, can, be, broadly, divided, into, three, broad, categories, direct, violence, structural, violence, and, cultural, violence, thus, defined, and, delineated, it, is, of, note, as, hyndman, says, that, geography, came, late, to, theorizing, violence, in, comparison, to, other, social, sciences, social, and, human, geography, rooted, in, the, humanist, marxist, and, feminist, subfields, that, emerged, following, the, early, positivist, approaches, and, subsequent, behavioral, turn, have, long, been, concerned, with, social, and, spatial, justice, along, with, critical, geographers, and, political, geographers, it, is, these, groupings, of, geographers, that, most, often, interact, with, violence, keeping, this, idea, of, social, spatial, justice, via, geography, in, mind, it, is, worthwhile, to, look, at, geographical, approaches, to, violence, in, the, context, of, politics, derek, gregory, and, alan, pred, assembled, the, influential, edited, collection, violent, geographies, fear, terror, and, political, violence, which, demonstrates, how, place, space, and, landscape, are, foremost, factors, in, the, real, and, imagined, practices, of, organized, violence, both, historically, and, in, the, present, evidently, political, violence, often, gives, a, part, for, the, state, to, play, when, modern, states, not, only, claim, a, monopoly, of, the, legitimate, means, of, violence, they, also, routinely, use, the, threat, of, violence, to, enforce, the, rule, of, law, the, law, not, only, becomes, a, form, of, violence, but, is, violence, philosopher, giorgio, agamben, s, concepts, of, state, of, exception, and, homo, sacer, are, useful, to, consider, within, a, geography, of, violence, the, state, in, the, grip, of, a, perceived, potential, crisis, whether, legitimate, or, not, takes, preventative, legal, measures, such, as, a, suspension, of, rights, it, is, in, this, climate, as, agamben, demonstrates, that, the, formation, of, the, social, democratic, and, nazi, government, s, lager, or, concentration, camp, can, occur, however, when, this, in, limbo, reality, is, designed, to, be, in, place, until, further, notice, the, state, of, exception, thus, ceases, to, be, referred, to, as, an, external, and, provisional, state, of, factual, danger, and, comes, to, be, confused, with, juridical, rule, itself, for, agamben, the, physical, space, of, the, camp, is, a, piece, of, land, placed, outside, the, normal, juridical, order, but, it, is, nevertheless, not, simply, an, external, space, at, the, scale, of, the, body, in, the, state, of, exception, a, person, is, so, removed, from, their, rights, by, juridical, procedures, and, deployments, of, power, that, no, act, committed, against, them, could, appear, any, longer, as, a, crime, in, other, words, people, become, only, homo, sacer, guantanamo, bay, could, also, be, said, to, represent, the, physicality, of, the, state, of, exception, in, space, and, can, just, as, easily, draw, man, as, homo, sacer, in, the, 1970s, genocides, in, cambodia, under, the, khmer, rouge, and, pol, pot, resulted, in, the, deaths, of, over, two, million, cambodians, which, was, 25, of, the, cambodian, population, forming, one, of, the, many, contemporary, examples, of, state, sponsored, violence, about, fourteen, thousand, of, these, murders, occurred, at, choeung, ek, which, is, the, best, known, of, the, extermination, camps, referred, to, as, the, killing, fields, the, killings, were, arbitrary, for, example, a, person, could, be, killed, for, wearing, glasses, since, that, was, seen, as, associating, them, with, intellectuals, and, therefore, as, making, them, part, of, the, enemy, people, were, murdered, with, impunity, because, it, was, no, crime, cambodians, were, made, homo, sacer, in, a, condition, of, bare, life, the, killing, fields, manifestations, of, agamben, s, concept, of, camps, beyond, the, normal, rule, of, law, featured, the, state, of, exception, as, part, of, pol, pot, s, ideological, intent, to, create, a, purely, agrarian, society, or, cooperative, he, dismantled, the, country, s, existing, economic, infrastructure, and, depopulated, every, urban, area, forced, movement, such, as, this, forced, movement, applied, by, pol, pot, is, a, clear, display, of, structural, violence, when, symbols, of, cambodian, society, were, equally, disrupted, social, institutions, of, every, kind, were, purged, or, torn, down, cultural, violence, defined, as, when, any, aspect, of, culture, such, as, language, religion, ideology, art, or, cosmology, is, used, to, legitimize, direct, or, structural, violence, is, added, to, the, structural, violence, of, forced, movement, and, to, the, direct, violence, such, as, murder, at, the, killing, fields, vietnam, eventually, intervened, and, the, genocide, officially, ended, however, ten, million, landmines, left, by, opposing, guerillas, in, the, 1970s, continue, to, create, a, violent, landscape, in, cambodia, human, geography, though, coming, late, to, the, theorizing, table, has, tackled, violence, through, many, lenses, including, anarchist, geography, feminist, geography, marxist, geography, political, geography, and, critical, geography, however, adriana, cavarero, notes, that, as, violence, spreads, and, assumes, unheard, of, forms, it, becomes, difficult, to, name, in, contemporary, language, cavarero, proposes, that, in, facing, such, a, truth, it, is, prudent, to, reconsider, violence, as, horrorism, that, is, as, though, ideally, all, the, victims, instead, of, their, killers, ought, to, determine, the, name, with, geography, often, adding, the, forgotten, spatial, aspect, to, theories, of, social, science, rather, than, creating, them, solely, within, the, discipline, it, seems, that, the, self, reflexive, contemporary, geography, of, today, may, have, an, extremely, important, place, in, this, current, re, imaging, of, violence, exemplified, by, cavarero, as, of, 2010, all, forms, of, violence, resulted, in, about, 1, 34, million, deaths, up, from, about, 1, million, in, 1990, suicide, accounts, for, about, 883, 000, interpersonal, violence, for, 456, 000, and, collective, violence, for, 18, 000, deaths, due, to, collective, violence, have, decreased, from, 64, 000, in, 1990, by, way, of, comparison, the, 1, 5, millions, deaths, a, year, due, to, violence, is, greater, than, the, number, of, deaths, due, to, tuberculosis, 1, 34, million, road, traffic, injuries, 1, 21, million, and, malaria, 830, 000, but, slightly, less, than, the, number, of, people, who, die, from, hiv, aids, 1, 77, million, for, every, death, due, to, violence, there, are, numerous, nonfatal, injuries, in, 2008, over, 16, million, cases, of, non, fatal, violence, related, injuries, were, severe, enough, to, require, medical, attention, beyond, deaths, and, injuries, forms, of, violence, such, as, child, maltreatment, intimate, partner, violence, and, elder, maltreatment, have, been, found, to, be, highly, prevalent, in, the, last, 45, years, suicide, rates, have, increased, by, 60, worldwide, suicide, is, among, the, three, leading, causes, of, death, among, those, aged, 15, 44, years, in, some, countries, and, the, second, leading, cause, of, death, in, the, 10, 24, years, age, group, these, figures, do, not, include, suicide, attempts, which, are, up, to, 20, times, more, frequent, than, suicide, suicide, was, the, 16th, leading, cause, of, death, worldwide, in, 2004, and, is, projected, to, increase, to, the, 12th, in, 2030, although, suicide, rates, have, traditionally, been, highest, among, the, male, elderly, rates, among, young, people, have, been, increasing, to, such, an, extent, that, they, are, now, the, group, at, highest, risk, in, a, third, of, countries, in, both, developed, and, developing, countries, rates, and, patterns, of, violent, death, vary, by, country, and, region, in, recent, years, homicide, rates, have, been, highest, in, developing, countries, in, sub, saharan, africa, and, latin, america, and, the, caribbean, and, lowest, in, east, asia, the, western, pacific, and, some, countries, in, northern, africa, studies, show, a, strong, inverse, relationship, between, homicide, rates, and, both, economic, development, and, economic, equality, poorer, countries, especially, those, with, large, gaps, between, the, rich, and, the, poor, tend, to, have, higher, rates, of, homicide, than, wealthier, countries, homicide, rates, differ, markedly, by, age, and, sex, gender, differences, are, least, marked, for, children, for, the, 15, to, 29, age, group, male, rates, were, nearly, six, times, those, for, female, rates, for, the, remaining, age, groups, male, rates, were, from, two, to, four, times, those, for, females, studies, in, a, number, of, countries, show, that, for, every, homicide, among, young, people, age, 10, to, 24, 20, to, 40, other, young, people, receive, hospital, treatment, for, a, violent, injury, forms, of, violence, such, as, child, maltreatment, and, intimate, partner, violence, are, highly, prevalent, approximately, 20, of, women, and, 5, 10, of, men, report, being, sexually, abused, as, children, while, 25, 50, of, all, children, report, being, physically, abused, a, who, multi, country, study, found, that, between, 15, and, 71, of, women, reported, experiencing, physical, and, or, sexual, violence, by, an, intimate, partner, at, some, point, in, their, lives, wars, grab, headlines, but, the, individual, risk, of, dying, violently, in, an, armed, conflict, is, today, relatively, low, much, lower, than, the, risk, of, violent, death, in, many, countries, that, are, not, suffering, from, an, armed, conflict, for, example, between, 1976, and, 2008, african, americans, were, victims, of, 329, 825, homicides, although, there, is, a, widespread, perception, that, war, is, the, most, dangerous, form, of, armed, violence, in, the, world, the, average, person, living, in, a, conflict, affected, country, had, a, risk, of, dying, violently, in, the, conflict, of, about, 2, 0, per, 100, 000, population, between, 2004, and, 2007, this, can, be, compared, to, the, average, world, homicide, rate, of, 7, 6, per, 100, 000, people, this, illustration, highlights, the, value, of, accounting, for, all, forms, of, armed, violence, rather, than, an, exclusive, focus, on, conflict, related, violence, certainly, there, are, huge, variations, in, the, risk, of, dying, from, armed, conflict, at, the, national, and, subnational, level, and, the, risk, of, dying, violently, in, a, conflict, in, specific, countries, remains, extremely, high, in, iraq, for, example, the, direct, conflict, death, rate, for, 2004, 07, was, 65, per, 100, 000, people, per, year, and, in, somalia, 24, per, 100, 000, people, this, rate, even, reached, peaks, of, 91, per, 100, 000, in, iraq, in, 2006, and, 74, per, 100, 000, in, somalia, in, 2007, scientific, evidence, for, warfare, has, come, from, settled, sedentary, communities, some, studies, argue, humans, have, a, predisposition, for, violence, chimpanzees, also, great, apes, have, been, known, to, kill, members, of, competing, groups, for, resources, like, food, a, comparison, across, mammal, species, found, that, humans, have, a, paleolithic, adult, homicide, rate, of, about, 2, this, would, be, lower, than, some, other, animals, but, still, high, however, this, study, took, into, account, the, infanticide, rate, by, some, other, animals, such, as, meerkats, but, not, of, humans, where, estimates, of, children, killed, by, infanticide, in, the, mesolithic, and, neolithic, eras, vary, from, 15, to, 50, percent, other, evidence, suggests, that, organized, large, scale, militaristic, or, regular, human, on, human, violence, was, absent, for, the, vast, majority, of, the, human, timeline, and, is, first, documented, to, have, started, only, relatively, recently, in, the, holocene, an, epoch, that, began, about, 11, 700, years, ago, probably, with, the, advent, of, higher, population, densities, due, to, sedentism, social, anthropologist, douglas, p, fry, writes, that, scholars, are, divided, on, the, origins, of, possible, increase, of, violence, in, other, words, war, like, behavior, there, are, basically, two, schools, of, thought, on, this, issue, one, holds, that, warfare, goes, back, at, least, to, the, time, of, the, first, thoroughly, modern, humans, and, even, before, then, to, the, primate, ancestors, of, the, hominid, lineage, the, second, positions, on, the, origins, of, warfare, sees, war, as, much, less, common, in, the, cultural, and, biological, evolution, of, humans, here, warfare, is, a, latecomer, on, the, cultural, horizon, only, arising, in, very, specific, material, circumstances, and, being, quite, rare, in, human, history, until, the, development, of, agriculture, in, the, past, 10, 000, years, jared, diamond, in, his, books, guns, germs, and, steel, and, the, third, chimpanzee, posits, that, the, rise, of, large, scale, warfare, is, the, result, of, advances, in, technology, and, city, states, for, instance, the, rise, of, agriculture, provided, a, significant, increase, in, the, number, of, individuals, that, a, region, could, sustain, over, hunter, gatherer, societies, allowing, for, development, of, specialized, classes, such, as, soldiers, or, weapons, manufacturers, in, academia, the, idea, of, the, peaceful, pre, history, and, non, violent, tribal, societies, gained, popularity, with, the, post, colonial, perspective, the, trend, starting, in, archaeology, and, spreading, to, anthropology, reached, its, height, in, the, late, half, of, the, 20th, century, however, some, newer, research, in, archaeology, and, bioarchaeology, may, provide, evidence, that, violence, within, and, among, groups, is, not, a, recent, phenomenon, according, to, the, book, the, bioarchaeology, of, violence, violence, is, a, behavior, that, is, found, throughout, human, history, lawrence, h, keeley, at, the, university, of, illinois, writes, in, war, before, civilization, that, 87, of, tribal, societies, were, at, war, more, than, once, per, year, and, that, 65, of, them, were, fighting, continuously, he, writes, that, the, attrition, rate, of, numerous, close, quarter, clashes, which, characterize, endemic, warfare, produces, casualty, rates, of, up, to, 60, compared, to, 1, of, the, combatants, as, is, typical, in, modern, warfare, primitive, warfare, of, these, small, groups, or, tribes, was, driven, by, the, basic, need, for, sustenance, and, violent, competition, fry, explores, keeley, s, argument, in, depth, and, counters, that, such, sources, erroneously, focus, on, the, ethnography, of, hunters, and, gatherers, in, the, present, whose, culture, and, values, have, been, infiltrated, externally, by, modern, civilization, rather, than, the, actual, archaeological, record, spanning, some, two, million, years, of, human, existence, fry, determines, that, all, present, ethnographically, studied, tribal, societies, by, the, very, fact, of, having, been, described, and, published, by, anthropologists, have, been, irrevocably, impacted, by, history, and, modern, colonial, nation, states, and, that, many, have, been, affected, by, state, societies, for, at, least, 5000, years, the, relatively, peaceful, period, since, world, war, ii, is, known, as, the, long, peace, steven, pinker, s, 2011, book, the, better, angels, of, our, nature, argued, that, modern, society, is, less, violent, than, in, periods, of, the, past, whether, on, the, short, scale, of, decades, or, long, scale, of, centuries, or, millennia, he, argues, for, a, paleolithic, homicide, rate, of, 15, steven, pinker, argues, that, by, every, possible, measure, every, type, of, violence, has, drastically, decreased, since, ancient, and, medieval, times, a, few, centuries, ago, for, example, genocide, was, a, standard, practice, in, all, kinds, of, warfare, and, was, so, common, that, historians, did, not, even, bother, to, mention, it, cannibalism, and, slavery, have, been, greatly, reduced, in, the, last, thousand, years, and, capital, punishment, is, now, banned, in, many, countries, according, to, pinker, rape, murder, warfare, and, animal, cruelty, have, all, seen, drastic, declines, in, the, 20th, century, pinker, s, analyses, have, also, been, criticized, concerning, the, statistical, question, of, how, to, measure, violence, and, whether, it, is, in, fact, declining, pinker, s, observation, of, the, decline, in, interpersonal, violence, echoes, the, work, of, norbert, elias, who, attributes, the, decline, to, a, civilizing, process, in, which, the, state, s, monopolization, of, violence, the, maintenance, of, socioeconomic, interdependencies, or, figurations, and, the, maintenance, of, behavioural, codes, in, culture, all, contribute, to, the, development, of, individual, sensibilities, which, increase, the, repugnance, of, individuals, towards, violent, acts, according, to, a, 2010, study, non, lethal, violence, such, as, assaults, or, bullying, appear, to, be, declining, as, well, some, scholars, disagree, with, the, argument, that, all, violence, is, decreasing, arguing, that, not, all, types, of, violent, behaviour, are, lower, now, than, in, the, past, they, suggest, that, research, typically, focuses, on, lethal, violence, often, looks, at, homicide, rates, of, death, due, to, warfare, but, ignore, the, less, obvious, forms, of, violence, beyond, deaths, and, injuries, highly, prevalent, forms, of, violence, such, as, child, maltreatment, and, intimate, partner, violence, have, serious, lifelong, non, injury, health, consequences, victims, may, engage, in, high, risk, behaviours, such, as, alcohol, and, substance, misuse, and, smoking, which, in, turn, can, contribute, to, cardiovascular, disorders, cancers, depression, diabetes, and, hiv, aids, resulting, in, premature, death, the, balances, of, prevention, mitigation, mediation, and, exacerbation, are, complex, and, vary, with, the, underpinnings, of, violence, in, countries, with, high, levels, of, violence, economic, growth, can, be, slowed, down, personal, and, collective, security, eroded, and, social, development, impeded, families, edging, out, of, poverty, and, investing, in, schooling, their, sons, and, daughters, can, be, ruined, through, the, violent, death, or, severe, disability, of, the, main, breadwinner, communities, can, be, caught, in, poverty, traps, where, pervasive, violence, and, deprivation, form, a, vicious, circle, that, stifles, economic, growth, for, societies, meeting, the, direct, costs, of, health, criminal, justice, and, social, welfare, responses, to, violence, diverts, many, billions, of, dollars, from, more, constructive, societal, spending, the, much, larger, indirect, costs, of, violence, due, to, lost, productivity, and, lost, investment, in, education, work, together, to, slow, economic, development, increase, socioeconomic, inequality, and, erode, human, and, social, capital, additionally, communities, with, high, level, of, violence, do, not, provide, the, level, of, stability, and, predictability, vital, for, a, prospering, business, economy, individuals, will, be, less, likely, to, invest, money, and, effort, towards, growth, in, such, unstable, and, violent, conditions, one, of, the, possible, proves, might, be, the, study, of, baten, and, gust, that, used, regicide, as, measurement, unit, to, approximate, the, influence, of, interpersonal, violence, and, depict, the, influence, of, high, interpersonal, violence, on, economic, development, and, level, of, investments, the, results, of, the, research, prove, the, correlation, of, the, human, capital, and, the, interpersonal, violence, in, 2016, the, institute, for, economics, and, peace, released, the, economic, value, of, peace, archived, 2017, 11, 15, at, the, wayback, machine, report, which, estimates, the, economic, impact, of, violence, and, conflict, on, the, global, economy, the, total, economic, impact, of, violence, on, the, world, economy, in, 2015, was, estimated, to, be, 13, 6, trillion, in, purchasing, power, parity, terms, religious, and, political, ideologies, have, been, the, cause, of, interpersonal, violence, throughout, history, ideologues, often, falsely, accuse, others, of, violence, such, as, the, ancient, blood, libel, against, jews, the, medieval, accusations, of, casting, witchcraft, spells, against, women, and, modern, accusations, of, satanic, ritual, abuse, against, day, care, center, owners, and, others, both, supporters, and, opponents, of, the, 21st, century, war, on, terrorism, regard, it, largely, as, an, ideological, and, religious, war, vittorio, bufacchi, describes, two, different, modern, concepts, of, violence, one, the, minimalist, conception, of, violence, as, an, intentional, act, of, excessive, or, destructive, force, the, other, the, comprehensive, conception, which, includes, violations, of, rights, including, a, long, list, of, human, needs, anti, capitalists, say, that, capitalism, is, violent, that, private, property, and, profit, survive, only, because, police, violence, defends, them, and, that, capitalist, economies, need, war, to, expand, in, this, view, capitalism, results, in, a, form, of, structural, violence, that, stems, from, inequality, environmental, damage, and, the, exploitation, of, women, and, people, of, colour, frantz, fanon, critiqued, the, violence, of, colonialism, and, wrote, about, the, counter, violence, of, the, colonized, victims, throughout, history, most, religions, and, individuals, like, mahatma, gandhi, have, preached, that, humans, are, capable, of, eliminating, individual, violence, and, organizing, societies, through, purely, nonviolent, means, gandhi, himself, once, wrote, a, society, organized, and, run, on, the, basis, of, complete, non, violence, would, be, the, purest, anarchy, modern, political, ideologies, which, espouse, similar, views, include, pacifist, varieties, of, voluntarism, mutualism, anarchism, and, libertarianism, luther, seminary, old, testament, scholar, terence, e, fretheim, wrote, about, the, old, testament, for, many, people, only, physical, violence, truly, qualifies, as, violence, but, certainly, violence, is, more, than, killing, people, unless, one, includes, all, those, words, and, actions, that, kill, people, slowly, the, effect, of, limitation, to, a, killing, fields, perspective, is, the, widespread, neglect, of, many, other, forms, of, violence, we, must, insist, that, violence, also, refers, to, that, which, is, psychologically, destructive, that, which, demeans, damages, or, depersonalizes, others, in, view, of, these, considerations, violence, may, be, defined, as, follows, any, action, verbal, or, nonverbal, oral, or, written, physical, or, psychical, active, or, passive, public, or, private, individual, or, institutional, societal, human, or, divine, in, whatever, degree, of, intensity, that, abuses, violates, injures, or, kills, some, of, the, most, pervasive, and, most, dangerous, forms, of, violence, are, those, that, are, often, hidden, from, view, against, women, and, children, especially, just, beneath, the, surface, in, many, of, our, homes, churches, and, communities, is, abuse, enough, to, freeze, the, blood, moreover, many, forms, of, systemic, violence, often, slip, past, our, attention, because, they, are, so, much, a, part, of, the, infrastructure, of, life, e, g, racism, sexism, ageism
