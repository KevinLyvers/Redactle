in, political, science, a, revolution, latin, revolutio, a, turn, around, is, a, rapid, fundamental, transformation, of, a, society, s, class, state, ethnic, or, religious, structures, according, to, sociologist, jack, goldstone, all, revolutions, contain, a, common, set, of, elements, at, their, core, a, efforts, to, change, the, political, regime, that, draw, on, a, competing, vision, or, visions, of, a, just, order, b, a, notable, degree, of, informal, or, formal, mass, mobilization, and, c, efforts, to, force, change, through, noninstitutionalized, actions, such, as, mass, demonstrations, protests, strikes, or, violence, revolutions, have, occurred, throughout, human, history, and, varied, in, their, methods, durations, and, outcomes, some, revolutions, started, with, peasant, uprisings, or, guerrilla, warfare, on, the, periphery, of, a, country, others, started, with, urban, insurrection, aimed, at, seizing, the, country, s, capital, city, revolutions, can, be, inspired, by, the, rising, popularity, of, certain, political, ideologies, moral, principles, or, models, of, governance, such, as, nationalism, republicanism, egalitarianism, self, determination, human, rights, democracy, liberalism, fascism, or, socialism, a, regime, may, become, vulnerable, to, revolution, due, to, a, recent, military, defeat, or, economic, chaos, or, an, affront, to, national, pride, and, identity, or, pervasive, repression, and, corruption, revolutions, typically, trigger, counterrevolutions, which, seek, to, halt, revolutionary, momentum, or, to, reverse, the, course, of, an, ongoing, revolutionary, transformation, notable, revolutions, in, recent, centuries, include, the, american, revolution, 1775, 1783, french, revolution, 1789, 1799, haitian, revolution, 1791, 1804, spanish, american, wars, of, independence, 1808, 1826, revolutions, of, 1848, in, europe, mexican, revolution, 1910, 1920, revolutions, of, 1917, 1923, in, russia, and, worldwide, xinhai, revolution, in, 1911, decolonization, of, africa, from, the, mid, 1950s, to, 1975, cuban, revolution, in, 1959, iranian, revolution, and, nicaraguan, revolution, in, 1979, worldwide, revolutions, of, 1989, and, arab, spring, in, the, early, 2010s, the, french, noun, revolucion, traces, back, to, the, 13th, century, and, the, english, equivalent, revolution, to, the, late, 14th, century, the, word, was, limited, then, to, mean, the, revolving, motion, of, celestial, bodies, revolution, in, the, sense, of, abrupt, change, in, a, social, order, was, first, recorded, in, the, mid, 15th, century, by, 1688, the, political, meaning, of, the, word, was, familiar, enough, that, the, replacement, of, james, ii, with, william, iii, was, termed, the, glorious, revolution, revolution, is, now, employed, most, often, to, denote, a, change, in, social, and, political, institutions, jeff, goodwin, offers, two, definitions, first, a, broad, one, including, any, and, all, instances, in, which, a, state, or, a, political, regime, is, overthrown, and, thereby, transformed, by, a, popular, movement, in, an, irregular, extraconstitutional, or, violent, fashion, second, a, narrow, one, in, which, revolutions, entail, not, only, mass, mobilization, and, regime, change, but, also, more, or, less, rapid, and, fundamental, social, economic, or, cultural, change, during, or, soon, after, the, struggle, for, state, power, jack, goldstone, defines, a, revolution, as, an, effort, to, transform, the, political, institutions, and, the, justifications, for, political, authority, in, society, accompanied, by, formal, or, informal, mass, mobilization, and, noninstitutionalized, actions, that, undermine, authorities, this, definition, is, broad, enough, to, encompass, events, ranging, from, the, relatively, peaceful, revolutions, that, toppled, communist, regimes, to, the, violent, islamic, revolution, in, afghanistan, at, the, same, time, this, definition, is, strong, enough, to, exclude, coups, revolts, civil, wars, and, rebellions, that, make, no, effort, to, transform, institutions, or, the, justification, for, authority, his, definition, also, excludes, peaceful, transitions, to, democracy, through, plebiscite, or, free, elections, as, occurred, in, spain, after, the, death, of, francisco, franco, or, in, argentina, and, chile, after, the, demise, of, their, military, juntas, early, scholars, often, debated, the, distinction, between, revolution, and, civil, war, they, also, questioned, whether, a, revolution, is, purely, political, i, e, concerned, with, the, restructuring, of, government, or, whether, it, is, an, extensive, and, inclusive, social, change, affecting, all, the, various, aspects, of, the, life, of, a, society, including, the, economic, religious, industrial, and, familial, as, well, as, the, political, there, are, numerous, typologies, of, revolution, in, the, social, science, literature, alexis, de, tocqueville, differentiated, between, one, of, the, marxist, typologies, divides, revolutions, into, charles, tilly, a, modern, scholar, of, revolutions, differentiated, between, mark, katz, identified, six, forms, of, revolution, these, categories, are, not, mutually, exclusive, the, russian, revolution, of, 1917, began, with, an, urban, revolution, to, depose, the, czar, followed, by, a, rural, revolution, followed, by, the, bolshevik, coup, in, november, katz, also, cross, classified, revolutions, as, follows, a, further, dimension, to, katz, s, typology, is, that, revolutions, are, either, against, anti, monarchy, anti, dictatorial, anti, communist, anti, democratic, or, for, pro, fascism, pro, communism, pro, nationalism, etc, in, the, latter, cases, a, transition, period, is, generally, necessary, to, decide, which, direction, to, take, to, achieve, the, desired, form, of, government, other, types, of, revolution, created, for, other, typologies, include, proletarian, or, communist, revolutions, inspired, by, the, ideas, of, marxism, that, aim, to, replace, capitalism, with, communism, failed, or, abortive, revolutions, that, aren, t, able, to, secure, power, after, winning, temporary, victories, or, amassing, large, scale, mobilizations, or, violent, vs, nonviolent, revolutions, the, term, revolution, has, also, been, used, to, denote, great, changes, outside, the, political, sphere, such, revolutions, often, labeled, social, revolutions, are, recognized, as, major, transformations, in, a, society, s, culture, philosophy, or, technology, rather, than, in, its, political, system, some, social, revolutions, are, global, in, scope, while, others, are, limited, to, single, countries, commonly, cited, examples, of, social, revolution, are, the, industrial, revolution, scientific, revolution, commercial, revolution, and, digital, revolution, these, revolutions, also, fit, the, slow, revolution, type, identified, by, tocqueville, political, and, socioeconomic, revolutions, have, been, studied, in, many, social, sciences, particularly, sociology, political, science, and, history, scholars, of, revolution, differentiate, four, generations, of, theoretical, research, on, the, subject, of, revolution, theorists, of, the, first, generation, including, gustave, le, bon, charles, a, ellwood, and, pitirim, sorokin, were, mainly, descriptive, in, their, approach, and, their, explanations, of, the, phenomena, of, revolutions, were, usually, related, to, social, psychology, such, as, le, bon, s, crowd, psychology, theory, the, second, generation, sought, to, develop, detailed, frameworks, grounded, in, social, behavior, theory, to, explain, why, and, when, revolutions, arise, their, work, can, be, divided, into, three, categories, psychological, sociological, and, political, the, writings, of, ted, robert, gurr, ivo, k, feierbrand, rosalind, l, feierbrand, james, a, geschwender, david, c, schwartz, and, denton, e, morrison, fall, into, the, first, category, they, utilized, theories, of, cognitive, psychology, and, frustration, aggression, theory, to, link, the, cause, of, revolution, to, the, state, of, mind, of, the, masses, while, these, theorists, varied, in, their, approach, as, to, what, exactly, incited, the, people, to, revolt, e, g, modernization, recession, or, discrimination, they, agreed, that, the, primary, cause, for, revolution, was, a, widespread, frustration, with, the, socio, political, situation, the, second, group, composed, of, academics, such, as, chalmers, johnson, neil, smelser, bob, jessop, mark, hart, edward, a, tiryakian, and, mark, hagopian, drew, on, the, work, of, talcott, parsons, and, the, structural, functionalist, theory, in, sociology, they, saw, society, as, a, system, in, equilibrium, between, various, resources, demands, and, subsystems, political, cultural, etc, as, in, the, psychological, school, they, differed, in, their, definitions, of, what, causes, disequilibrium, but, agreed, that, it, is, a, state, of, severe, disequilibrium, that, is, responsible, for, revolutions, the, third, group, including, writers, such, as, charles, tilly, samuel, p, huntington, peter, ammann, and, arthur, l, stinchcombe, followed, a, political, science, path, and, looked, at, pluralist, theory, and, interest, group, conflict, theory, those, theories, view, events, as, outcomes, of, a, power, struggle, between, competing, interest, groups, in, such, a, model, revolutions, happen, when, two, or, more, groups, cannot, come, to, terms, within, the, current, political, system, s, normal, decision, making, process, and, when, they, possess, the, required, resources, to, employ, force, in, pursuit, of, their, goals, the, second, generation, theorists, regarded, the, development, of, revolutionary, situations, as, a, two, step, process, first, a, pattern, of, events, arises, that, somehow, marks, a, break, or, change, from, previous, patterns, this, change, then, affects, some, critical, variable, the, cognitive, state, of, the, masses, the, equilibrium, of, the, system, or, the, magnitude, of, conflict, and, resource, control, of, competing, interest, groups, if, the, effect, on, the, critical, variable, is, of, sufficient, magnitude, a, potentially, revolutionary, situation, occurs, once, this, point, is, reached, a, negative, incident, a, war, a, riot, a, bad, harvest, that, in, the, past, might, not, have, been, enough, to, trigger, a, revolt, will, now, be, enough, however, if, authorities, are, cognizant, of, the, danger, they, can, still, prevent, revolution, through, reform, or, repression, in, his, influential, 1938, book, the, anatomy, of, revolution, historian, crane, brinton, established, a, convention, by, choosing, four, major, political, revolutions, england, 1642, thirteen, colonies, of, america, 1775, france, 1789, and, russia, 1917, for, comparative, study, he, outlined, what, he, called, their, uniformities, although, the, american, revolution, deviated, somewhat, from, the, pattern, as, a, result, most, later, comparative, studies, of, revolution, substituted, china, 1949, in, their, lists, but, they, continued, brinton, s, practice, of, focusing, on, four, in, subsequent, decades, scholars, began, to, classify, hundreds, of, other, events, as, revolutions, see, list, of, revolutions, and, rebellions, their, expanded, notion, of, revolution, engendered, new, approaches, and, explanations, the, theories, of, the, second, generation, came, under, criticism, for, being, too, limited, in, geographical, scope, and, for, lacking, a, means, of, empirical, verification, also, while, second, generation, theories, may, have, been, capable, of, explaining, a, specific, revolution, they, could, not, adequately, explain, why, revolutions, failed, to, occur, in, other, societies, experiencing, very, similar, circumstances, the, criticism, of, the, second, generation, led, to, the, rise, of, a, third, generation, of, theories, put, forth, by, writers, such, as, theda, skocpol, barrington, moore, jeffrey, paige, and, others, expanding, on, the, old, marxist, class, conflict, approach, they, turned, their, attention, to, rural, agrarian, state, conflicts, state, conflicts, with, autonomous, elites, and, the, impact, of, interstate, economic, and, military, competition, on, domestic, political, change, in, particular, skocpol, s, states, and, social, revolutions, 1979, was, a, landmark, book, of, the, third, generation, skocpol, defined, revolution, as, rapid, basic, transformations, of, society, s, state, and, class, structures, accompanied, and, in, part, carried, through, by, class, based, revolts, from, below, and, she, attributed, revolutions, to, a, conjunction, of, multiple, conflicts, involving, state, elites, and, the, lower, classes, in, the, late, 1980s, a, new, body, of, academic, work, started, questioning, the, dominance, of, the, third, generation, s, theories, the, old, theories, were, also, dealt, a, significant, blow, by, a, series, of, revolutionary, events, that, they, could, not, readily, explain, the, iranian, and, nicaraguan, revolutions, of, 1979, the, 1986, people, power, revolution, in, the, philippines, and, the, 1989, autumn, of, nations, in, europe, asia, and, africa, saw, diverse, opposition, movements, topple, seemingly, powerful, regimes, amidst, popular, demonstrations, and, mass, strikes, in, nonviolent, revolutions, for, some, historians, the, traditional, paradigm, of, revolutions, as, class, struggle, driven, conflicts, centered, in, europe, and, involving, a, violent, state, versus, its, discontented, people, was, no, longer, sufficient, to, account, for, the, multi, class, coalitions, toppling, dictators, around, the, world, consequently, the, study, of, revolutions, began, to, evolve, in, three, directions, as, goldstone, describes, it, scholars, of, revolution, the, fourth, generation, increasingly, turned, to, quantitative, techniques, when, formulating, its, theories, political, science, research, moved, beyond, individual, or, comparative, case, studies, towards, large, n, statistical, analysis, assessing, the, causes, and, implications, of, revolution, the, initial, fourth, generation, books, and, journal, articles, generally, relied, on, the, polity, data, series, on, democratization, such, analyses, like, those, by, enterline, maoz, and, mansfield, and, snyder, identified, a, revolution, by, a, significant, change, in, the, country, s, score, on, polity, s, autocracy, to, democracy, scale, more, recently, scholars, like, jeff, colgan, have, argued, that, the, polity, data, series, which, evaluates, the, degree, of, democratic, or, autocratic, authority, in, a, state, s, governing, institutions, based, on, the, openness, of, executive, recruitment, constraints, on, executive, authority, and, political, competition, is, inadequate, because, it, measures, democratization, not, revolution, and, doesn, t, account, for, regimes, which, come, to, power, by, revolution, but, fail, to, change, the, structure, of, the, state, and, society, sufficiently, to, yield, a, notable, difference, in, the, polity, score, instead, colgan, offered, a, new, data, set, to, single, out, governments, that, transform, the, existing, social, political, and, economic, relationships, of, the, state, by, overthrowing, or, rejecting, the, principal, existing, institutions, of, society, this, data, set, has, been, employed, to, make, empirically, based, contributions, to, the, literature, on, revolution, by, finding, links, between, revolution, and, the, likelihood, of, international, disputes, revolutions, have, also, been, examined, from, an, anthropological, perspective, drawing, on, victor, turner, s, writings, on, ritual, and, performance, bjorn, thomassen, suggested, that, revolutions, can, be, understood, as, liminal, moments, modern, political, revolutions, very, much, resemble, rituals, and, can, therefore, be, studied, within, a, process, approach, this, would, imply, not, only, a, focus, on, political, behavior, from, below, but, also, a, recognition, of, moments, where, high, and, low, are, relativized, subverted, or, made, irrelevant, and, where, the, micro, and, macro, levels, fuse, together, in, critical, conjunctions, economist, douglass, north, raised, a, note, of, caution, about, revolutionary, change, how, it, is, never, as, revolutionary, as, its, rhetoric, would, have, us, believe, while, the, formal, rules, of, laws, and, constitutions, can, be, changed, virtually, overnight, the, informal, constraints, such, as, institutional, inertia, and, cultural, inheritance, do, not, change, quickly, and, thereby, slow, down, the, societal, transformation, according, to, north, the, tension, between, formal, rules, and, informal, constraints, is, typically, resolved, by, some, restructuring, of, the, overall, constraints, in, both, directions, to, produce, a, new, equilibrium, that, is, far, less, revolutionary, than, the, rhetoric
