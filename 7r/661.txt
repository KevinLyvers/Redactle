a, welfare, state, is, a, form, of, government, in, which, the, state, or, a, well, established, network, of, social, institutions, protects, and, promotes, the, economic, and, social, well, being, of, its, citizens, based, upon, the, principles, of, equal, opportunity, equitable, distribution, of, wealth, and, public, responsibility, for, citizens, unable, to, avail, themselves, of, the, minimal, provisions, for, a, good, life, there, is, substantial, variability, in, the, form, and, trajectory, of, the, welfare, state, across, countries, and, regions, all, welfare, states, entail, some, degree, of, private, public, partnerships, wherein, the, administration, and, delivery, of, at, least, some, welfare, programs, occur, through, private, entities, welfare, state, services, are, also, provided, at, varying, territorial, levels, of, government, early, features, of, the, welfare, state, such, as, public, pensions, and, social, insurance, developed, from, the, 1880s, onwards, in, industrializing, western, countries, world, war, i, the, great, depression, and, world, war, ii, have, been, characterized, as, important, events, that, ushered, in, the, expansion, of, the, welfare, state, the, fullest, forms, of, the, welfare, state, were, developed, after, world, war, ii, the, term, welfare, is, much, older, than, the, term, welfare, state, in, enlightened, absolutism, the, ruler, had, an, unlimited, position, of, power, which, he, was, to, only, utilize, to, the, extent, necessary, for, the, welfare, of, his, subjects, the, content, of, the, welfare, or, good, police, which, limited, the, ruler, s, legitimate, exercise, of, power, was, defined, by, the, authorities, at, their, own, discretion, this, is, also, referred, to, as, welfare, absolutism, the, term, welfare, state, is, used, in, connection, with, princely, absolutism, this, is, usually, in, conjunction, with, attributes, such, as, absolutist, mercantilist, or, pre, modern, the, german, term, sozialstaat, social, state, has, been, used, since, 1870, to, describe, state, support, programs, devised, by, german, sozialpolitiker, social, politicians, and, implemented, as, part, of, otto, von, bismarck, s, conservative, reforms, today, the, term, is, used, almost, entirely, for, the, modern, welfare, state, which, emerged, in, the, 19th, century, in, the, course, of, the, socio, economic, upheavals, caused, by, industrialisation, the, formation, of, nation, states, and, democratization, while, the, corresponding, english, term, welfare, state, is, descriptively, neutral, the, term, wohlfahrtsstaat, is, often, used, in, german, as, a, fighting, term, with, a, pejorative, connotation, the, literal, english, equivalent, social, state, did, not, catch, on, in, anglophone, countries, however, during, the, second, world, war, anglican, archbishop, william, temple, author, of, the, book, christianity, and, the, social, order, 1942, popularized, the, concept, using, the, phrase, welfare, state, bishop, temple, s, use, of, welfare, state, has, been, connected, to, benjamin, disraeli, s, 1845, novel, sybil, or, the, two, nations, in, other, words, the, rich, and, the, poor, where, he, writes, power, has, only, one, duty, to, secure, the, social, welfare, of, the, people, at, the, time, he, wrote, sybil, disraeli, later, a, prime, minister, belonged, to, young, england, a, conservative, group, of, youthful, tories, who, disagreed, with, how, the, whigs, dealt, with, the, conditions, of, the, industrial, poor, members, of, young, england, attempted, to, garner, support, among, the, privileged, classes, to, assist, the, less, fortunate, and, to, recognize, the, dignity, of, labor, that, they, imagined, had, characterized, england, during, the, feudal, middle, ages, emperor, ashoka, of, india, put, forward, his, idea, of, a, welfare, state, in, the, 3rd, century, bce, he, envisioned, his, dharma, religion, or, path, as, not, just, a, collection, of, high, sounding, phrases, he, consciously, tried, to, adopt, it, as, a, matter, of, state, policy, he, declared, that, all, men, are, my, children, and, whatever, exertion, i, make, i, strive, only, to, discharge, debt, that, i, owe, to, all, living, creatures, it, was, a, completely, new, ideal, of, kingship, ashoka, renounced, war, and, conquest, by, violence, and, forbade, the, killing, of, many, animals, since, he, wanted, to, conquer, the, world, through, love, and, faith, he, sent, many, missions, to, propagate, dharma, such, missions, were, sent, to, places, like, egypt, greece, and, sri, lanka, the, propagation, of, dharma, included, many, measures, of, people, s, welfare, centers, of, the, treatment, of, men, and, beasts, founded, inside, and, outside, of, the, empire, shady, groves, wells, orchards, and, rest, houses, were, laid, out, ashoka, also, prohibited, useless, sacrifices, and, certain, forms, of, gatherings, which, led, to, waste, indiscipline, and, superstition, to, implement, these, policies, he, recruited, a, new, cadre, of, officers, called, dharmamahamattas, part, of, this, group, s, duties, was, to, see, that, people, of, various, sects, were, treated, fairly, they, were, especially, asked, to, look, after, the, welfare, of, prisoners, however, the, historical, record, of, ashoka, s, character, is, conflicted, ashoka, s, own, inscriptions, state, that, he, converted, to, buddhism, after, waging, a, destructive, war, however, the, sri, lankan, tradition, claims, that, he, had, already, converted, to, buddhism, in, the, 4th, year, of, his, reign, although, it, does, not, mention, the, conquest, of, kalinga, during, this, war, according, to, ashoka, s, major, rock, edict, 13, with, nearly, 100, 000, killed, in, the, war, and, another, 150, 000, deported, some, sources, particularly, buddhist, oral, legends, suggest, that, his, conversion, was, dramatic, and, that, he, dedicated, the, rest, of, his, life, to, the, pursuit, of, peace, and, the, common, good, however, these, sources, frequently, contradict, each, other, and, a, few, sources, like, ashokavadana, earliest, versions, ranging, from, 200, ad, to, 500, ad, describe, ashoka, engaging, in, sectarian, mass, murder, throughout, his, reign, and, make, no, mention, of, the, philanthropic, efforts, claimed, by, earlier, legends, the, interpretation, of, ashoka, s, dharma, after, conversion, is, controversial, but, in, particular, the, texts, which, describe, him, personally, ordering, the, massacre, of, buddhist, heretics, and, jains, have, been, disputed, by, many, scholars, since, these, are, directly, contradictory, to, his, own, edicts, and, are, legendary, in, nature, the, emperor, wen, 203, 157, bce, of, han, dynasty, instituted, a, variety, of, measures, with, resemblances, to, modern, welfare, policies, these, included, pensions, in, the, form, of, food, and, wine, to, all, over, 80, years, of, age, as, well, as, monetary, support, in, the, form, of, loans, or, tax, breaks, to, widows, orphans, and, elderly, without, children, to, support, them, emperor, wen, was, also, known, for, a, concern, over, wasteful, spending, of, tax, payer, money, unlike, other, han, emperors, he, wore, simple, silk, garments, in, order, to, make, the, state, serve, the, common, people, better, cruel, criminal, punishments, were, lessened, and, the, state, bureaucracy, was, made, more, meritocratic, this, led, to, officials, being, selected, by, examinations, for, the, first, time, in, chinese, history, the, roman, republic, intervened, sporadically, to, distribute, free, or, subsidized, grain, to, its, population, through, the, program, known, as, cura, annonae, the, city, of, rome, grew, rapidly, during, the, roman, republic, and, empire, reaching, a, population, approaching, one, million, in, the, second, century, ad, the, population, of, the, city, grew, beyond, the, capacity, of, the, nearby, rural, areas, to, meet, the, food, needs, of, the, city, regular, grain, distribution, began, in, 123, bc, with, a, grain, law, proposed, by, gaius, gracchus, and, approved, by, the, roman, plebeian, council, popular, assembly, the, numbers, of, those, receiving, free, or, subsidized, grain, expanded, to, a, high, of, an, estimated, 320, 000, people, at, one, point, in, the, 3rd, century, ad, the, dole, of, grain, was, replaced, by, bread, probably, during, the, reign, of, septimius, severus, 193, 211, ad, severus, also, began, providing, olive, oil, to, residents, of, rome, and, later, the, emperor, aurelian, 270, 275, ordered, the, distribution, of, wine, and, pork, the, doles, of, bread, olive, oil, wine, and, pork, apparently, continued, until, near, the, end, of, the, western, roman, empire, in, 476, ad, the, dole, in, the, early, roman, empire, is, estimated, to, account, for, 15, to, 33, percent, of, the, total, grain, imported, and, consumed, in, rome, in, addition, to, food, the, roman, republic, also, supplied, free, entertainment, through, ludi, public, games, public, money, was, allocated, for, the, staging, of, ludi, but, the, presiding, official, increasingly, came, to, augment, the, splendor, of, his, games, from, personal, funds, as, a, form, of, public, relations, the, sponsor, was, able, to, cultivate, the, favor, of, the, people, of, rome, the, concept, of, states, taxing, for, the, welfare, budget, was, introduced, to, the, arabs, in, the, early, 7th, century, by, caliph, omar, most, likely, adapted, from, the, newly, roman, territories, zakat, is, also, one, of, the, five, pillars, of, islam, and, is, a, mandatory, form, of, 2, 5, income, tax, to, be, paid, by, all, individuals, earning, above, a, basic, threshold, to, provide, for, the, needy, once, a, year, after, ramadan, umar, 584, 644, leader, of, the, rashidun, caliphate, empire, established, a, welfare, state, through, the, bayt, al, mal, treasury, which, for, instance, was, used, to, stockpile, food, in, every, region, of, the, islamic, empire, reserved, for, arabs, in, the, peninsula, otto, von, bismarck, established, the, first, welfare, state, in, a, modern, industrial, society, with, social, welfare, legislation, in, 1880s, imperial, germany, bismarck, extended, the, privileges, of, the, junker, social, class, to, ordinary, germans, his, 17, november, 1881, imperial, message, to, the, reichstag, used, the, term, practical, christianity, to, describe, his, program, german, laws, from, this, era, also, insured, workers, against, industrial, risks, inherent, in, the, workplace, in, switzerland, the, swiss, factory, act, of, 1877, limited, working, hours, for, everyone, and, gave, maternity, benefits, the, swiss, welfare, state, also, arose, in, the, late, 19th, century, its, existence, and, depth, varied, individually, by, canton, some, of, the, programs, first, adopted, were, emergency, relief, elementary, schools, and, homes, for, the, elderly, and, children, in, the, austro, hungarian, empire, a, version, was, set, up, by, count, eduard, von, taaffe, a, few, years, after, bismarck, in, germany, legislation, to, help, the, working, class, in, austria, emerged, from, catholic, conservatives, von, taffe, used, swiss, and, german, models, of, social, reform, including, the, swiss, factory, act, of, 1877, german, laws, that, insured, workers, against, industrial, risks, inherent, in, the, workplace, to, create, the, 1885, trade, code, amendment, changed, attitudes, in, reaction, to, the, worldwide, great, depression, of, the, 1930s, which, brought, unemployment, and, misery, to, millions, were, instrumental, in, the, move, to, the, welfare, state, in, many, countries, during, the, great, depression, the, welfare, state, was, seen, as, a, middle, way, between, the, extremes, of, communism, on, the, left, and, unregulated, laissez, faire, capitalism, on, the, right, in, the, period, following, world, war, ii, some, countries, in, western, europe, moved, from, partial, or, selective, provision, of, social, services, to, relatively, comprehensive, cradle, to, grave, coverage, of, the, population, other, western, european, states, did, not, such, as, the, united, kingdom, ireland, spain, and, france, political, scientist, eileen, mcdonagh, has, argued, that, a, major, determinant, of, where, welfare, states, arose, is, whether, or, not, a, country, had, a, historical, monarchy, with, familial, foundations, a, trait, that, max, weber, called, patrimonialism, in, places, where, the, monarchic, state, was, viewed, as, a, parental, steward, of, the, populace, it, was, easier, to, shift, into, a, mindset, where, the, industrial, state, could, also, serve, as, a, parental, steward, of, the, populace, the, activities, of, present, day, welfare, states, extend, to, the, provision, of, both, cash, welfare, benefits, such, as, old, age, pensions, or, unemployment, benefits, and, in, kind, welfare, services, such, as, health, or, childcare, services, through, these, provisions, welfare, states, can, affect, the, distribution, of, wellbeing, and, personal, autonomy, among, their, citizens, as, well, as, influencing, how, their, citizens, consume, and, how, they, spend, their, time, historian, of, the, 20th, century, fascist, movement, robert, paxton, observes, that, the, provisions, of, the, welfare, state, were, enacted, in, the, 19th, century, by, religious, conservatives, to, counteract, appeals, from, trade, unions, and, socialism, later, paxton, writes, all, the, modern, twentieth, century, european, dictatorships, of, the, right, both, fascist, and, authoritarian, were, welfare, states, they, all, provided, medical, care, pensions, affordable, housing, and, mass, transport, as, a, matter, of, course, in, order, to, maintain, productivity, national, unity, and, social, peace, in, germany, adolf, hitler, s, nazi, party, maintained, the, welfare, state, established, by, previous, german, governments, but, restructured, it, so, as, to, help, only, aryan, individuals, considered, worthy, of, assistance, excluding, alcoholics, tramps, homosexuals, prostitutes, the, work, shy, or, the, asocial, habitual, criminals, the, hereditarily, ill, a, widely, defined, category, and, members, of, races, other, than, the, aryan, nevertheless, even, with, these, limitations, over, 17, million, german, citizens, were, receiving, assistance, under, the, auspices, of, the, national, socialist, people, s, welfare, by, 1939, when, social, democratic, parties, abandoned, marxism, after, world, war, ii, they, increasingly, accepted, the, welfare, state, as, a, political, goal, either, as, a, temporary, goal, within, capitalism, or, an, ultimate, goal, in, itself, a, theoretical, addition, from, 2005, is, that, of, kahl, in, their, article, the, religious, roots, of, modern, policy, catholic, lutheran, and, reformed, protestant, traditions, compared, they, argue, that, the, welfare, state, policies, of, several, european, countries, can, be, traced, back, to, their, religious, origins, this, process, has, its, origin, in, the, poor, relief, systems, and, social, norms, present, in, christian, nations, the, example, countries, are, categorized, as, follows, catholic, spain, italy, and, france, lutheran, denmark, sweden, and, germany, reformed, protestant, netherlands, the, uk, and, the, usa, the, catholic, countries, late, adoption, of, welfare, benefits, and, social, assistance, the, latter, being, splintered, and, meagre, is, due, to, several, religious, and, social, factors, alms, giving, was, an, important, part, of, catholic, society, as, the, wealthy, could, resolve, their, sins, through, participation, in, the, act, as, such, begging, was, allowed, and, was, subject, to, a, greater, degree, of, acceptance, poverty, was, seen, as, being, close, to, grace, and, there, was, no, onus, for, change, placed, onto, the, poor, these, factors, coupled, with, the, power, of, the, church, meant, that, state, provided, benefits, did, not, arise, until, late, in, the, 20th, century, additionally, social, assistance, was, not, done, at, a, comprehensive, level, each, group, in, need, had, their, assistance, added, incrementally, this, accounts, for, the, fragmented, nature, of, social, assistance, in, these, countries, lutheran, states, were, early, to, provide, welfare, and, late, to, provide, social, assistance, but, this, was, done, uniformly, poverty, was, seen, as, more, of, an, individual, affliction, of, laziness, and, immorality, work, was, viewed, as, a, calling, as, such, these, societies, banned, begging, and, created, workhouses, to, force, the, able, bodied, to, work, these, uniform, state, actions, paved, the, way, for, comprehensive, welfare, benefits, as, those, who, worked, deserved, assistance, when, in, need, when, social, assistance, was, delivered, for, those, who, had, never, worked, it, was, in, the, context, of, the, uniform, welfare, provision, the, concept, of, predestination, is, key, for, understanding, welfare, assistance, in, reformed, protestant, states, poor, people, were, seen, as, being, punished, therefore, begging, and, state, assistance, was, non, existent, as, such, churches, and, charities, filled, the, void, resulting, in, early, social, assistance, and, late, welfare, benefits, the, usa, still, has, minimal, welfare, benefits, today, because, of, their, religious, roots, according, to, kahl, also, from, 2005, jacob, hacker, stated, that, there, was, broad, agreement, in, research, on, welfare, that, there, had, not, been, welfare, state, retrenchment, instead, social, policy, frameworks, remain, secure, broadly, speaking, welfare, states, are, either, universal, with, provisions, that, cover, everybody, or, selective, with, provisions, covering, only, those, deemed, most, needy, in, his, 1990, book, the, three, worlds, of, welfare, capitalism, danish, sociologist, g, sta, esping, andersen, further, identified, three, subtypes, of, welfare, state, models, liberal, social, democratic, and, conservative, esping, anderson, development, of, the, three, subtypes, of, welfare, regimes, were, categorized, under, three, dimensions, 1, state, and, market, relations, or, the, relationship, between, the, state, and, market, 2, stratification, or, social, relations, and, relationships, 3, social, citizenship, rights, or, whether, or, not, an, individual, is, dependent, on, the, labor, market, since, the, building, of, the, decommodification, index, is, limited, and, the, typology, is, debatable, these, 18, countries, could, be, ranked, from, most, purely, social, democratic, sweden, to, the, most, liberal, the, united, states, 597, ireland, represents, a, near, hybrid, model, whereby, two, streams, of, unemployment, benefit, exist, contributory, and, means, tested, however, payments, can, begin, immediately, and, are, theoretically, available, to, all, irish, citizens, even, if, they, have, never, worked, provided, they, are, habitually, resident, social, stigma, varies, across, the, three, conceptual, welfare, states, particularly, it, is, highest, in, liberal, states, and, lowest, in, social, democratic, states, esping, andersen, proposes, that, the, universalist, nature, of, social, democratic, states, eliminate, the, duality, between, beneficiaries, and, non, recipients, whereas, in, means, tested, liberal, states, there, is, resentment, towards, redistribution, efforts, that, is, to, say, the, lower, the, percent, of, gdp, spent, on, welfare, the, higher, the, stigma, of, the, welfare, state, esping, andersen, also, argues, that, welfare, states, set, the, stage, for, post, industrial, employment, evolution, in, terms, of, employment, growth, structure, and, stratification, he, uses, germany, sweden, and, the, united, states, to, provide, examples, of, the, differing, results, of, each, of, the, three, welfare, states, according, to, evelyne, huber, and, john, stephens, different, types, of, welfare, states, emerged, as, a, result, of, prolonged, government, by, different, parties, they, distinguish, between, social, democratic, welfare, states, christian, democratic, welfare, states, and, wage, earner, states, according, to, the, swedish, political, scientist, bo, rothstein, in, non, universal, welfare, states, the, state, is, primarily, concerned, with, directing, resources, to, the, people, most, in, need, this, requires, tight, bureaucratic, control, in, order, to, determine, who, is, eligible, for, assistance, and, who, is, not, under, universal, models, such, as, sweden, on, the, other, hand, the, state, distributes, welfare, to, all, people, who, fulfill, easily, established, criteria, e, g, having, children, receiving, medical, treatment, etc, with, as, little, bureaucratic, interference, as, possible, this, however, requires, higher, taxation, due, to, the, scale, of, services, provided, this, model, was, constructed, by, the, scandinavian, ministers, karl, kristian, steincke, and, gustav, m, ller, in, the, 1930s, and, is, dominant, in, scandinavia, sociologist, lane, kenworthy, argues, that, the, nordic, experience, demonstrates, that, the, modern, social, democratic, model, can, promote, economic, security, expand, opportunity, and, ensure, rising, living, standards, for, all, while, facilitating, freedom, flexibility, and, market, dynamism, american, political, scientist, benjamin, radcliff, has, also, argued, that, the, universality, and, generosity, of, the, welfare, state, i, e, the, extent, of, decommodification, is, the, single, most, important, societal, level, structural, factor, affecting, the, quality, of, human, life, based, on, the, analysis, of, time, serial, data, across, both, the, industrial, democracies, and, the, american, states, he, maintains, that, the, welfare, state, improves, life, for, everyone, regardless, of, social, class, as, do, similar, institutions, such, as, pro, worker, labor, market, regulations, and, strong, labor, unions, esping, andersen, s, welfare, typology, is, often, criticized, by, feminists, for, being, gender, blind, according, to, keerty, nakray, esping, andersen, s, three, types, of, dimensions, state, and, market, relations, stratification, and, social, citizenship, rights, does, not, acknowledge, unpaid, care, work, done, by, women, within, the, household, economy, this, failure, of, recognizing, unpaid, work, is, due, to, the, fact, that, welfare, states, are, focused, on, the, male, breadwinner, concept, because, esping, andersen, argued, that, the, welfare, state, set, the, stage, for, employment, evolution, the, lack, of, gender, analysis, creates, an, unintended, emphasis, on, male, employment, sociologist, ann, shola, orloff, reframes, the, three, dimensions, with, a, gendered, lens, as, she, reframes, orloff, incorporates, gender, and, expands, the, decommodification, index, within, three, dimensions, 1, focus, on, families, and, the, welfare, states, in, state, and, market, relations, 2, including, the, relationship, between, gender, and, labor, in, stratifications, on, social, provisions, 3, how, men, and, women, are, dependent, on, the, labor, market, and, the, effect, of, welfare, on, decommodification, for, both, genders, reframing, the, decommodification, index, with, a, gendered, lens, ensures, women, doing, care, work, don, t, get, left, behind, within, the, welfare, state, universal, basic, income, ubi, has, been, proposed, as, a, replacement, for, the, traditional, welfare, state, where, social, protection, schemes, are, also, social, policies, with, a, precise, aim, that, can, be, regarded, as, social, engineering, the, focus, of, the, ubi, is, granting, individuals, more, freedom, in, determining, life, choices, by, providing, a, lifetime, of, financial, security, regardless, of, one, s, career, preferences, or, lifepath, according, to, statements, of, american, enterprise, institute, affiliated, libertarian, conservative, scholar, charles, murray, recalled, and, sanctioned, by, the, george, gibbs, chair, in, political, economy, and, senior, research, fellow, at, the, mercatus, center, at, george, mason, university, and, nationally, syndicated, columnist, veronique, de, rugy, as, of, 2014, the, annual, cost, of, a, ubi, in, the, us, would, have, been, about, 200, billion, cheaper, than, the, us, system, put, in, place, at, that, date, by, 2020, it, would, have, been, nearly, a, trillion, dollars, cheaper, prior, to, 1900, in, australia, charitable, assistance, from, benevolent, societies, sometimes, with, financial, contributions, from, the, authorities, was, the, primary, means, of, relief, for, people, not, able, to, support, themselves, the, 1890s, economic, depression, and, the, rise, of, the, trade, unions, and, the,

and, 1930s, detailed, proposals, were, developed, for, a, comprehensive, national, insurance, scheme, covering, medical, disability, unemployment, and, pension, benefits, multiple, royal, commissions, were, held, on, the, subject, and, the, scheme, was, legislated, as, the, national, health, and, pensions, insurance, act, 1938, however, the, scheme, was, ultimately, abandoned, for, cost, reasons, in, the, lead, up, to, the, second, world, war, during, the, second, world, war, the, federal, government, created, a, welfare, state, by, enacting, national, schemes, for, child, endowment, in, 1941,

emigration, to, the, united, states, where, wages, were, higher, but, welfare, did, not, exist, bismarck, further, won, the, support, of, both, industry, and, skilled, workers, through, his, high, tariff, policies, which, protected, profits, and, wages, from, american, competition, although, they, alienated, the, liberal, intellectuals, who, wanted, free, trade, during, the, 12, years, of, rule, by, adolf, hitler, s, nazi, party, the, welfare, state, established, by, previous, german, governments, was, maintained, but, it, was, restructured, so, as, to, help, only, aryan, individuals,

divided, into, two, groups, depending, on, their, welfare, effort, levels, the, first, group, which, for, convenience, we, may, call, welfare, states, includes, uruguay, argentina, chile, costa, rica, and, brazil, within, this, group, average, social, spending, per, capita, in, the, 1973, 2000, period, was, around, 532, while, as, a, percentage, of, gdp, and, as, a, share, of, the, budget, social,

group, social, spending, per, capita, averaged, 96, 6, while, social, spending, as, a, percentage, of, gdp, and, as, a, percentage, of, the, budget, averaged, 5, 2, and, 34, 7, percent, respectively,

national, insurance, act, 1911, setting, up, a, national, insurance, contribution, for, unemployment, and, health, benefits, from, work, the, people, s, budget, was, introduced, by, the, chancellor, of, the, exchequer, david, lloyd, george, in, 1909, to, fund, the, welfare, reforms, after, much, opposition, it, was, passed, by, the, house, of, lords, on, 29, april, 1910, the, minimum, wage, was, introduced, in, the, united, kingdom, in, 1909, for, certain, low, wage, industries, and, expanded, to, numerous, industries, including, farm, labour, by, 1920, however, by, the, 1920s, a, new, perspective, was, offered, by, reformers, to, emphasize, the, usefulness, of, family, allowance, targeted, at, low, income, families, as, the, alternative, to, relieving, poverty, without, distorting, the, labour, market, the, trade, unions, and, the, labour, party, adopted, this, view, in, 1945, family, allowances, were, introduced, minimum, wages, faded, from, view, talk, resumed, in, the, 1970s, but, in, the, 1980s, the, thatcher, administration, made, it, clear, it, would, not, accept, a, national, minimum, wage, finally, with, the, return, of, labour, the, national, minimum, wage, act,

the, beveridge, report, after, its, chairman, sir, william, beveridge, the, beveridge, report, proposed, a, series, of, measures, to, aid, those, who, were, in, need, of, help, or, in, poverty, and, recommended, that, the, government, find, ways, of, tackling, what, the, report, called, the, five, giants, want, disease, ignorance, squalor, and, idleness, it, urged, the, government, to, take, steps, to, provide, citizens, with, adequate, income, adequate, health, care, adequate, education, adequate, housing, and, adequate, employment, proposing, that, ll, people, of, working, age, should, pay, a, weekly, national, insurance, contribution, in, return, benefits, would, be, paid, to, people, who, were, sick, unemployed, retired, or, widowed, the, beveridge, report, assumed, that, the, national, health, service, would, provide, free, health, care, to, all, citizens, and, that, a, universal, child, benefit, would, give, benefits, to, parents, encouraging, people, to, have, children, by, enabling, them, to, feed, and, support, a, family, the, liberal, party, the, conservative, party, and, then, the, labour, party, all, adopted, the, beveridge, report, s, recommendations, following, the, labour, election, victory, in, the, 1945, general, election, many, of, beveridge, s, reforms, were, implemented, through, a, series, of, acts, of, parliament, on, 5, july, 1948, the, national, insurance, act, national, assistance, act, and, national, health, service, act, came, into, force, forming, the, key, planks, of, the, modern, uk, welfare, state, in, 1949, the, legal, aid, and, advice, act, was, passed, providing, the, fourth, pillar, of, the, modern, welfare, state, access, to, advice, for, legal, redress, for, all, before, 1939, most, health, care, had, to, be, paid, for, through, non, government, organisations, through, a, vast, network, of, friendly, societies, trade, unions, and, other, insurance, companies, which, counted, the, vast, majority, of, the, uk, working, population, as, members, these, organizations, provided, insurance, for, sickness, unemployment, and, disability, providing, an, income, to, people, when, they, were, unable, to, work, as, part, of, the, reforms, the, church, of, england, also, closed, down, its, voluntary, relief, networks, and, passed, the, ownership, of, thousands, of, church, schools, hospitals, and, other, bodies, to, the, state, welfare, systems, continued, to, develop, over, the, following, decades, by, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, parts, of, the, welfare, system, had, been, restructured, with, some, provision, channelled, through, non, governmental, organizations, which, became, important, providers, of, social, services, the, united, states, developed, a, limited, welfare, state, in, the, 1930s, the, earliest, and, most, comprehensive, philosophical, justification, for, the, welfare, state, was, produced, by, an, american, the, sociologist, lester, frank, ward, 1841, 1913, whom, the, historian, henry, steele, commager, called, the, father, of, the, modern, welfare, state, ward, saw, social, phenomena, as, amenable, to, human, control, it, is, only, through, the, artificial, control, of, natural, phenomena, that, science, is, made, to, minister, to, human, needs, he, wrote, and, if, social, laws, are, really, analogous, to, physical, laws, there, is, no, reason, why, social, science, should, not, receive, practical, application, such, as, have, been, given, to, physical, science, ward, wrote, the, charge, of, paternalism, is, chiefly, made, by, the, class, that, enjoys, the, largest, share, of, government, protection, those, who, denounce, it, are, those, who, most, frequently, and, successfully, invoke, it, nothing, is, more, obvious, today, than, the, single, inability, of, capital, and, private, enterprise, to, take, care, of, themselves, unaided, by, the, state, and, while, they, are, incessantly, denouncing, paternalism, by, which, they, mean, the, claim, of, the, defenceless, laborer, and, artisan, to, a, share, in, this, lavish, state, protection, they, are, all, the, while, besieging, legislatures, for, relief, from, their, own, incompetency, and, pleading, the, baby, act, through, a, trained, body, of, lawyers, and, lobbyists, the, dispensing, of, national, pap, to, this, class, should, rather, be, called, maternalism, to, which, a, square, open, and, dignified, paternalism, would, be, infinitely, preferable, ward, s, theories, centred, around, his, belief, that, a, universal, and, comprehensive, system, of, education, was, necessary, if, a, democratic, government, was, to, function, successfully, his, writings, profoundly, influenced, younger, generations, of, progressive, thinkers, such, as, theodore, roosevelt, thomas, dewey, and, frances, perkins, 1880, 1965, among, others, the, united, states, was, the, only, industrialized, country, that, went, into, the, great, depression, of, the, 1930s, with, no, social, insurance, policies, in, place, in, 1935, franklin, d, roosevelt, s, new, deal, instituted, significant, social, insurance, policies, in, 1938, congress, passed, the, fair, labor, standards, act, limiting, the, work, week, to, 40, hours, and, banning, child, labor, for, children, under, 16, over, stiff, congressional, opposition, from, the, low, wage, south, the, social, security, law, was, very, unpopular, among, many, groups, especially, farmers, who, resented, the, additional, taxes, and, feared, they, would, never, be, made, good, they, lobbied, hard, for, exclusion, furthermore, the, treasury, realized, how, difficult, it, would, be, to, set, up, payroll, deduction, plans, for, farmers, for, housekeepers, who, employed, maids, and, for, non, profit, groups, therefore, they, were, excluded, state, employees, were, excluded, for, constitutional, reasons, the, federal, government, in, the, united, states, cannot, tax, state, governments, federal, employees, were, also, excluded, by, 2013, the, u, s, remained, the, only, major, industrial, state, without, a, uniform, national, sickness, program, american, spending, on, health, care, as, a, percent, of, gdp, is, the, highest, in, the, world, but, it, is, a, complex, mix, of, federal, state, philanthropic, employer, and, individual, funding, the, us, spent, 16, of, its, gdp, on, health, care, in, 2008, compared, to, 11, in, france, in, second, place, some, scholars, such, as, gerard, friedman, argue, that, labor, union, weakness, in, the, southern, united, states, undermined, unionization, and, social, reform, throughout, the, united, states, as, a, whole, and, is, largely, responsible, for, the, anemic, u, s, welfare, state, sociologists, lo, c, wacquant, and, john, l, campbell, contend, that, since, the, rise, of, neoliberal, ideology, in, the, late, 1970s, and, early, 1980s, an, expanding, carceral, state, or, government, system, of, mass, incarceration, has, largely, supplanted, the, increasingly, retrenched, social, welfare, state, which, has, been, justified, by, its, proponents, with, the, argument, that, the, citizenry, must, take, on, personal, responsibility, scholars, assert, that, this, transformation, of, the, welfare, state, to, a, post, welfare, punitive, state, along, with, neoliberal, structural, adjustment, policies, and, the, globalization, of, the, u, s, economy, have, created, more, extreme, forms, of, destitute, poverty, in, the, u, s, which, must, be, contained, and, controlled, by, expanding, the, criminal, justice, system, into, every, aspect, of, the, lives, of, the, poor, other, scholars, such, as, esping, andersen, argue, that, the, welfare, state, in, the, united, states, has, been, characterized, by, private, provision, because, such, a, state, would, better, reflect, the, racial, and, sexual, biases, within, the, private, sector, the, disproportionate, number, of, racial, and, sexual, minorities, in, private, sector, jobs, with, weaker, benefits, he, argues, is, evidence, that, the, american, welfare, state, is, not, necessarily, intended, to, improve, the, economic, situation, of, such, groups, empirical, evidence, suggests, that, taxes, and, transfers, considerably, reduce, poverty, in, most, western, countries, whose, welfare, states, constitute, at, least, a, fifth, of, gdp, researchers, have, found, very, little, correlation, between, economic, performance, and, social, expenditure, they, also, see, little, evidence, that, social, expenditures, contribute, to, losses, in, productivity, economist, peter, lindert, of, the, university, of, california, davis, attributes, this, to, policy, innovations, such, as, the, implementation, of, pro, growth, tax, policies, in, real, world, welfare, states, social, expenses, have, also, not, contributed, significantly, to, public, debt, martin, eiermann, wrote, according, to, the, oecd, social, expenditures, in, its, 34, member, countries, rose, steadily, between, 1980, and, 2007, but, the, increase, in, costs, was, almost, completely, offset, by, gdp, growth, more, money, was, spent, on, welfare, because, more, money, circulated, in, the, economy, and, because, government, revenues, increased, in, 1980, the, oecd, averaged, social, expenditures, equal, to, 16, percent, of, gdp, in, 2007, just, before, the, financial, crisis, kicked, into, full, gear, they, had, risen, to, 19, percent, a, manageable, increase, a, norwegian, study, covering, the, period, 1980, to, 2003, found, welfare, state, spending, correlated, negatively, with, student, achievement, however, many, of, the, top, ranking, oecd, countries, on, the, 2009, pisa, tests, are, considered, welfare, states, the, table, below, shows, social, expenditure, as, a, percentage, of, gdp, for, oecd, member, states, in, 2018, early, conservatives, under, the, influence, of, thomas, malthus, 1766, 1834, opposed, every, form, of, social, insurance, root, and, branch, malthus, believed, that, the, poor, needed, to, learn, the, hard, way, to, practice, frugality, self, control, and, chastity, traditional, conservatives, also, protested, that, the, effect, of, social, insurance, would, be, to, weaken, private, charity, and, loosen, traditional, social, bonds, of, family, friends, religious, and, non, governmental, welfare, organisations, on, the, other, hand, karl, marx, opposed, piecemeal, reforms, advanced, by, middle, class, reformers, out, of, a, sense, of, duty, in, his, address, of, the, central, committee, to, the, communist, league, written, after, the, failed, revolution, of, 1848, he, warned, that, measures, designed, to, increase, wages, improve, working, conditions, and, provide, social, insurance, were, merely, bribes, that, would, temporarily, make, the, situation, of, working, classes, tolerable, to, weaken, the, revolutionary, consciousness, that, was, needed, to, achieve, a, socialist, economy, nevertheless, marx, also, proclaimed, that, the, communists, had, to, support, the, bourgeoisie, wherever, it, acted, as, a, revolutionary, progressive, class, because, bourgeois, liberties, had, first, to, be, conquered, and, then, criticised, in, the, 20th, century, opponents, of, the, welfare, state, have, expressed, apprehension, about, the, creation, of, a, large, possibly, self, interested, bureaucracy, required, to, administer, it, and, the, tax, burden, on, the, wealthier, citizens, that, this, entailed, conservative, and, libertarian, groups, such, as, the, heritage, foundation, and, the, cato, institute, argue, that, welfare, creates, dependence, a, disincentive, to, work, and, reduces, the, opportunity, of, individuals, to, manage, their, own, lives, this, dependence, is, called, a, culture, of, poverty, which, is, said, to, undermine, people, from, finding, meaningful, work, many, of, these, groups, also, point, to, the, large, budget, used, to, maintain, these, programs, and, assert, that, it, is, wasteful, in, the, book, losing, ground, charles, murray, argues, that, welfare, not, only, increases, poverty, but, also, increases, other, problems, such, as, single, parent, households, and, crime, in, 2012, political, historian, alan, ryan, pointed, out, that, the, modern, welfare, state, stops, short, of, being, an, advance, in, the, direction, of, socialism, ts, egalitarian, elements, are, more, minimal, than, either, its, defenders, or, its, critics, think, it, does, not, entail, advocacy, for, social, ownership, of, industry, ryan, further, wrote, the, modern, welfare, state, does, not, set, out, to, make, the, poor, richer, and, the, rich, poorer, which, is, a, central, element, in, socialism, but, to, help, people, to, provide, for, themselves, in, sickness, while, they, enjoy, good, health, to, put, money, aside, to, cover, unemployment, while, they, are, in, work, and, to, have, adults, provide, for, the, education, of, their, own, and, other, people, s, children, expecting, those, children, s, future, taxes, to, pay, in, due, course, for, the, pensions, of, their, parents, generation, these, are, devices, for, shifting, income, across, different, stages, in, life, not, for, shifting, income, across, classes, another, distinct, difference, is, that, social, insurance, does, not, aim, to, transform, work, and, working, relations, employers, and, employees, pay, taxes, at, a, level, they, would, not, have, done, in, the, nineteenth, century, but, owners, are, not, expropriated, profits, are, not, illegitimate, cooperativism, does, not, replace, hierarchical, management, in, 2017, historian, walter, scheidel, argued, that, the, establishment, of, welfare, states, in, the, west, in, the, early, 20th, century, could, be, partly, a, reaction, by, elites, to, the, bolshevik, revolution, and, its, violence, against, the, bourgeoisie, which, feared, violent, revolution, in, its, own, backyard, they, were, diminished, decades, later, as, the, perceived, threat, receded, scheidel, spoke, to, vice, s, matt, taylor, in, an, interview, it, s, a, little, tricky, because, the, us, never, really, had, any, strong, leftist, movement, but, if, you, look, at, europe, after, 1917, people, were, really, scared, about, communism, in, all, the, western, european, countries, you, have, all, these, poor, people, they, might, rise, up, and, kill, us, and, take, our, stuff, that, wasn, t, just, a, fantasy, because, it, was, happening, next, door, and, that, we, can, show, did, trigger, steps, in, the, direction, of, having, more, welfare, programs, and, a, rudimentary, safety, net, in, response, to, fear, of, communism, not, that, they, would, invade, but, that, there, would, be, homegrown, movements, of, this, sort, american, populism, is, a, little, different, because, it, s, more, detached, from, that, but, it, happens, roughly, at, the, same, time, and, people, in, america, are, worried, about, communism, too, not, necessarily, very, reasonably, but, that, was, always, in, the, background, and, people, have, only, begun, to, study, systematically, to, what, extent, the, threat, real, or, imagined, of, this, type, of, radical, regime, really, influenced, policy, changes, in, western, democracies, you, don, t, necessarily, even, have, to, go, out, and, kill, rich, people, if, there, was, some, plausible, alternative, out, there, it, would, arguably, have, an, impact, on, policy, making, at, home, that, s, certainly, there, in, the, 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, and, 60s, and, there, s, a, debate, right, because, it, becomes, clear, that, the, soviet, union, is, really, not, in, very, good, shape, and, people, don, t, really, like, to, be, there, and, all, these, movements, lost, their, appeal, that, s, a, contributing, factor, arguably, that, the, end, of, the, cold, war, coincides, roughly, with, the, time, when, inequality, really, starts, going, up, again, because, elites, are, much, more, relaxed, about, the, possibility, of, credible, alternatives, or, threats, being, out, there, some, argue, that, the, public, opinion, on, welfare, in, the, us, is, in, part, a, product, of, racist, and, classist, political, and, ideological, campaigns, the, popular, myth, of, the, welfare, queen, a, person, taking, advantage, of, the, welfare, system, came, to, be, as, a, result, of, one, such, effort, in, 1980, ronald, reagan, s, presidential, campaign, relied, on, anti, poor, tactics, and, the, anti, black, strategy, of, putting, down, the, black, vote, in, order, to, win, the, favor, of, the, white, populace, thus, racist, stereotypes, and, polarizing, dog, whistles, of, this, era, gave, birth, to, this, fictitious, character, the, first, version, of, the, welfare, queen, was, a, lazy, and, selfish, woman, living, off, of, state, benefits, and, having, many, children, to, obtain, as, much, financial, support, as, possible, in, another, case, it, was, a, man, buying, t, bone, steaks, with, food, stamps, while, the, rest, of, the, country, struggled, to, put, food, on, the, table, while, never, stated, directly, it, was, presumed, by, the, public, that, both, characters, were, of, course, black, people, who, were, lazily, exploiting, the, system, and, lived, lavishly, while, the, regular, hard, working, middle, class, american, imagined, by, the, public, to, be, white, had, to, foot, the, bill, in, the, welfare, queen, race, gender, class, and, public, opinion, carly, hayden, foster, analyzes, martin, gilens, writing, in, why, americans, hate, welfare, and, argues, that, race, interacts, with, gender, and, class, these, aspects, together, are, then, key, determinants, in, whether, or, not, there, is, public, support, for, welfare, according, to, her, analysis, survey, respondents, are, more, likely, to, support, welfare, spending, if, the, mother, reliant, on, welfare, is, described, as, white, while, a, black, welfare, mother, fares, significantly, less, support, it, is, argued, that, this, is, in, part, because, of, the, idea, that, the, black, mother, would, then, have, an, incentive, to, have, more, black, babies, but, is, in, general, interrelated, with, the, perceived, reproductive, behavior, of, the, mother, which, in, this, case, is, affected, by, the, enduring, jezebel, stereotype, that, presents, black, women, as, inherently, sexually, promiscuous, similarly, public, support, of, welfare, is, unlikely, in, the, case, of, poor, single, mothers, the, widespread, assumption, that, welfare, recipients, are, fraudulent, and, lazy, apparently, guides, public, opinion, in, the, crime, of, survival, jullily, kohler, hausmann, defends, the, position, that, anti, fraud, campaigns, as, it, relates, to, welfare, worsen, public, perception, of, welfare, recipients, and, frame, them, as, criminals, he, goes, on, to, cite, martin, gilens, who, in, why, americans, hate, welfare, argues, large, majority, of, americans, agree, that, government, should, provide, monetary, support, to, those, who, are, unable, to, support, themselves, but, the, perception, of, welfare, abuse, is, widespread, indeed, as, the, survey, evidence, suggests, it, would, be, hard, to, exaggerate, the, level, of, cynicism, toward, welfare, recipients, held, by, the, american, public, this, perception, of, welfare, recipients, dishonesty, and, freeloading, is, at, the, core, of, americans, conviction, that, welfare, spending, should, be, cut, this, sentiment, was, perpetrated, by, the, reagan, administration, and, he, himself, addressed, the, supposed, fraud, in, public, programs, in, his, first, inaugural, address, during, his, presidency, welfare, spending, tighetened, and, the, anti, fraud, rhetoric, was, used, to, justify, big, cuts, to, welfare, programs, regarding, this, period, martin, gilens, cites, julius, wilson, who, writes, as, the, economic, situation, worsened, ronald, reagan, was, able, to, convince, many, working, and, middle, class, americans, that, the, decline, in, their, living, standards, was, attributable, to, expensive, programs, for, the, poor, martin, gilens, argues, that, economic, circumstance, is, a, deciding, factor, in, the, public, opinion, on, welfare, he, says, that, during, the, period, of, growing, economy, people, are, willing, to, share, their, profits, with, the, less, fortunate, but, this, generosity, disappears, in, times, of, economic, turmoil, as, people, are, primarily, preoccupied, with, their, own, well, being, and, are, less, willing, to, provide, for, the, poor, because, their, own, situation, takes, precedence, he, cites, michael, katz, who, claims, that, the, stagflation, following, the, 1973, energy, crisis, caused, the, public, opinion, to, shift, toward, a, negative, attitude, toward, the, expansion, of, the, social, welfare, state, as, people, who, worried, for, their, financial, future, were, in, search, of, a, scape, goat, for, their, economic, losses, in, this, case, welfare, recipients
