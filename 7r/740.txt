fear, is, an, intensely, unpleasant, primal, emotion, in, response, to, perceiving, or, recognizing, a, danger, or, threat, fear, causes, psychological, changes, that, may, produce, behavioral, reactions, such, as, mounting, an, aggressive, response, or, fleeing, the, threat, fear, in, human, beings, may, occur, in, response, to, a, certain, stimulus, occurring, in, the, present, or, in, anticipation, or, expectation, of, a, future, threat, perceived, as, a, risk, to, oneself, the, fear, response, arises, from, the, perception, of, danger, leading, to, confrontation, with, or, escape, from, avoiding, the, threat, also, known, as, the, fight, or, flight, response, which, in, extreme, cases, of, fear, horror, and, terror, can, be, a, freeze, response, the, fear, response, is, also, implicated, in, a, number, of, mental, disorders, particularly, anxiety, disorders, in, humans, and, other, animals, fear, is, modulated, by, the, process, of, cognition, and, learning, thus, fear, is, judged, as, rational, and, appropriate, or, irrational, and, inappropriate, or, unconscious, an, irrational, fear, is, called, a, phobia, fear, is, closely, related, to, the, emotion, anxiety, which, occurs, as, the, result, of, often, future, threats, that, are, perceived, to, be, uncontrollable, or, unavoidable, the, fear, response, serves, survival, by, engendering, appropriate, behavioral, responses, so, it, has, been, preserved, throughout, evolution, sociological, and, organizational, research, also, suggests, that, individuals, fears, are, not, solely, dependent, on, their, nature, but, are, also, shaped, by, their, social, relations, and, culture, which, guide, their, understanding, of, when, and, how, much, fear, to, feel, many, physiological, changes, in, the, body, are, associated, with, fear, summarized, as, the, fight, or, flight, response, an, innate, response, for, coping, with, danger, it, works, by, accelerating, the, breathing, rate, hyperventilation, heart, rate, vasoconstriction, of, the, peripheral, blood, vessels, leading, to, blood, pooling, dilating, the, pupils, increasing, muscle, tension, including, the, muscles, attached, to, each, hair, follicle, to, contract, and, causing, goosebumps, or, more, clinically, piloerection, making, a, cold, person, warmer, or, a, frightened, animal, look, more, impressive, sweating, increased, blood, glucose, hyperglycemia, increased, serum, calcium, increase, in, white, blood, cells, called, neutrophilic, leukocytes, alertness, leading, to, sleep, disturbance, and, butterflies, in, the, stomach, dyspepsia, this, primitive, mechanism, may, help, an, organism, survive, by, either, running, away, or, fighting, the, danger, with, the, series, of, physiological, changes, the, consciousness, realizes, an, emotion, of, fear, there, are, observable, physical, reactions, in, individuals, who, experience, fear, an, individual, might, experience, a, feeling, of, dizziness, lightheaded, like, they, are, being, choked, sweating, shortness, of, breath, vomiting, or, nausea, numbness, or, shaking, and, any, other, like, symptoms, these, bodily, reactions, informs, the, individual, that, they, are, afraid, and, should, proceed, to, remove, or, get, away, from, the, stimulus, that, is, causing, that, fear, an, influential, categorization, of, stimuli, causing, fear, was, proposed, by, psychologist, jeffrey, alan, gray, namely, intensity, novelty, special, evolutionary, dangers, stimuli, arising, during, social, interaction, and, conditioned, stimuli, another, categorization, was, proposed, by, archer, who, besides, conditioned, fear, stimuli, categorized, fear, evoking, as, well, as, aggression, evoking, stimuli, into, three, groups, namely, pain, novelty, and, frustration, although, he, also, described, looming, which, refers, to, an, object, rapidly, moving, towards, the, visual, sensors, of, a, subject, and, can, be, categorized, as, intensity, russell, described, a, more, functional, categorization, of, fear, evoking, stimuli, in, which, for, instance, novelty, is, a, variable, affecting, more, than, one, category, 1, predator, stimuli, including, movement, suddenness, proximity, but, also, learned, and, innate, predator, stimuli, 2, physical, environmental, dangers, including, intensity, and, heights, 3, stimuli, associated, with, increased, risk, of, predation, and, other, dangers, including, novelty, openness, illumination, and, being, alone, 4, stimuli, stemming, from, conspecifics, including, novelty, movement, and, spacing, behavior, 5, species, predictable, fear, stimuli, and, experience, special, evolutionary, dangers, and, 6, fear, stimuli, that, are, not, species, predictable, conditioned, fear, stimuli, although, many, fears, are, learned, the, capacity, to, fear, is, part, of, human, nature, many, studies, have, found, that, certain, fears, e, g, animals, heights, are, much, more, common, than, others, e, g, flowers, clouds, these, fears, are, also, easier, to, induce, in, the, laboratory, this, phenomenon, is, known, as, preparedness, because, early, humans, that, were, quick, to, fear, dangerous, situations, were, more, likely, to, survive, and, reproduce, preparedness, is, theorized, to, be, a, genetic, effect, that, is, the, result, of, natural, selection, from, an, evolutionary, psychology, perspective, different, fears, may, be, different, adaptations, that, have, been, useful, in, our, evolutionary, past, they, may, have, developed, during, different, time, periods, some, fears, such, as, fear, of, heights, may, be, common, to, all, mammals, and, developed, during, the, mesozoic, period, other, fears, such, as, fear, of, snakes, may, be, common, to, all, simians, and, developed, during, the, cenozoic, time, period, the, still, ongoing, geological, era, encompassing, the, last, 66, million, of, history, still, others, such, as, fear, of, mice, and, insects, may, be, unique, to, humans, and, developed, during, the, paleolithic, and, neolithic, time, periods, when, mice, and, insects, become, important, carriers, of, infectious, diseases, and, harmful, for, crops, and, stored, foods, nonhuman, animals, and, humans, innovate, specific, fears, as, a, result, of, learning, this, has, been, studied, in, psychology, as, fear, conditioning, beginning, with, john, b, watson, s, little, albert, experiment, in, 1920, which, was, inspired, after, observing, a, child, with, an, irrational, fear, of, dogs, in, this, study, an, 11, month, old, boy, was, conditioned, to, fear, a, white, rat, in, the, laboratory, the, fear, became, generalized, to, include, other, white, furry, objects, such, as, a, rabbit, dog, and, even, a, santa, claus, mask, with, white, cotton, balls, in, the, beard, fear, can, be, learned, by, experiencing, or, watching, a, frightening, traumatic, accident, for, example, if, a, child, falls, into, a, well, and, struggles, to, get, out, he, or, she, may, develop, a, fear, of, wells, heights, acrophobia, enclosed, spaces, claustrophobia, or, water, aquaphobia, there, are, studies, looking, at, areas, of, the, brain, that, are, affected, in, relation, to, fear, when, looking, at, these, areas, such, as, the, amygdala, it, was, proposed, that, a, person, learns, to, fear, regardless, of, whether, they, themselves, have, experienced, trauma, or, if, they, have, observed, the, fear, in, others, in, a, study, completed, by, andreas, olsson, katherine, i, nearing, and, elizabeth, a, phelps, the, amygdala, were, affected, both, when, subjects, observed, someone, else, being, submitted, to, an, aversive, event, knowing, that, the, same, treatment, awaited, themselves, and, when, subjects, were, subsequently, placed, in, a, fear, provoking, situation, this, suggests, that, fear, can, develop, in, both, conditions, not, just, simply, from, personal, history, fear, is, affected, by, cultural, and, historical, context, for, example, in, the, early, 20th, century, many, americans, feared, polio, a, disease, that, can, lead, to, paralysis, there, are, consistent, cross, cultural, differences, in, how, people, respond, to, fear, display, rules, affect, how, likely, people, are, to, express, the, facial, expression, of, fear, and, other, emotions, fear, of, victimization, is, a, function, of, perceived, risk, and, seriousness, of, potential, harm, according, to, surveys, some, of, the, most, common, fears, are, of, demons, and, ghosts, the, existence, of, evil, powers, cockroaches, spiders, snakes, heights, water, enclosed, spaces, tunnels, bridges, needles, social, rejection, failure, examinations, and, public, speaking, regionally, some, may, more, so, fear, terrorist, attacks, death, war, criminal, or, gang, violence, being, alone, the, future, nuclear, war, flying, clowns, intimacy, people, and, driving, fear, of, the, unknown, or, irrational, fear, is, caused, by, negative, thinking, worry, which, arises, from, anxiety, accompanied, by, a, subjective, sense, of, apprehension, or, dread, irrational, fear, shares, a, common, neural, pathway, with, other, fears, a, pathway, that, engages, the, nervous, system, to, mobilize, bodily, resources, in, the, face, of, danger, or, threat, many, people, are, scared, of, the, unknown, the, irrational, fear, can, branch, out, to, many, areas, such, as, the, hereafter, the, next, ten, years, or, even, tomorrow, chronic, irrational, fear, has, deleterious, effects, since, the, elicitor, stimulus, is, commonly, absent, or, perceived, from, delusions, such, fear, can, create, comorbidity, with, the, anxiety, disorder, umbrella, being, scared, may, cause, people, to, experience, anticipatory, fear, of, what, may, lie, ahead, rather, than, planning, and, evaluating, for, the, same, for, example, continuation, of, scholarly, education, is, perceived, by, many, educators, as, a, risk, that, may, cause, them, fear, and, stress, and, they, would, rather, teach, things, they, ve, been, taught, than, go, and, do, research, the, ambiguity, of, situations, that, tend, to, be, uncertain, and, unpredictable, can, cause, anxiety, in, addition, to, other, psychological, and, physical, problems, in, some, populations, especially, those, who, engage, it, constantly, for, example, in, war, ridden, places, or, in, places, of, conflict, terrorism, abuse, etc, poor, parenting, that, instills, fear, can, also, debilitate, a, child, s, psyche, development, or, personality, for, example, parents, tell, their, children, not, to, talk, to, strangers, in, order, to, protect, them, in, school, they, would, be, motivated, to, not, show, fear, in, talking, with, strangers, but, to, be, assertive, and, also, aware, of, the, risks, and, the, environment, in, which, it, takes, place, ambiguous, and, mixed, messages, like, this, can, affect, their, self, esteem, and, self, confidence, researchers, say, talking, to, strangers, is, not, something, to, be, thwarted, but, allowed, in, a, parent, s, presence, if, required, developing, a, sense, of, equanimity, to, handle, various, situations, is, often, advocated, as, an, antidote, to, irrational, fear, and, as, an, essential, skill, by, a, number, of, ancient, philosophies, fear, of, the, unknown, fotu, may, be, a, or, possibly, the, fundamental, fear, from, early, times, when, there, were, many, threats, to, life, although, fear, behavior, varies, from, species, to, species, it, is, often, divided, into, two, main, categories, namely, avoidance, flight, and, immobility, to, these, different, researchers, have, added, different, categories, such, as, threat, display, and, attack, protective, responses, including, startle, and, looming, responses, defensive, burying, and, social, responses, including, alarm, vocalizations, and, submission, finally, immobility, is, often, divided, into, freezing, and, tonic, immobility, the, decision, as, to, which, particular, fear, behavior, to, perform, is, determined, by, the, level, of, fear, as, well, as, the, specific, context, such, as, environmental, characteristics, escape, route, present, distance, to, refuge, the, presence, of, a, discrete, and, localized, threat, the, distance, between, threat, and, subject, threat, characteristics, speed, size, directness, of, approach, the, characteristics, of, the, subject, under, threat, size, physical, condition, speed, degree, of, crypsis, protective, morphological, structures, social, conditions, group, size, and, the, amount, of, experience, with, the, type, of, the, threat, often, laboratory, studies, with, rats, are, conducted, to, examine, the, acquisition, and, extinction, of, conditioned, fear, responses, in, 2004, researchers, conditioned, rats, rattus, norvegicus, to, fear, a, certain, stimulus, through, electric, shock, the, researchers, were, able, to, then, cause, an, extinction, of, this, conditioned, fear, to, a, point, that, no, medications, or, drugs, were, able, to, further, aid, in, the, extinction, process, the, rats, showed, signs, of, avoidance, learning, not, fear, but, simply, avoiding, the, area, that, brought, pain, to, the, test, rats, the, avoidance, learning, of, rats, is, seen, as, a, conditioned, response, and, therefore, the, behavior, can, be, unconditioned, as, supported, by, the, earlier, research, species, specific, defense, reactions, ssdrs, or, avoidance, learning, in, nature, is, the, specific, tendency, to, avoid, certain, threats, or, stimuli, it, is, how, animals, survive, in, the, wild, humans, and, animals, both, share, these, species, specific, defense, reactions, such, as, the, flight, or, fight, which, also, include, pseudo, aggression, fake, or, intimidating, aggression, and, freeze, response, to, threats, which, is, controlled, by, the, sympathetic, nervous, system, these, ssdrs, are, learned, very, quickly, through, social, interactions, between, others, of, the, same, species, other, species, and, interaction, with, the, environment, these, acquired, sets, of, reactions, or, responses, are, not, easily, forgotten, the, animal, that, survives, is, the, animal, that, already, knows, what, to, fear, and, how, to, avoid, this, threat, an, example, in, humans, is, the, reaction, to, the, sight, of, a, snake, many, jump, backwards, before, cognitively, realizing, what, they, are, jumping, away, from, and, in, some, cases, it, is, a, stick, rather, than, a, snake, as, with, many, functions, of, the, brain, there, are, various, regions, of, the, brain, involved, in, deciphering, fear, in, humans, and, other, nonhuman, species, the, amygdala, communicates, both, directions, between, the, prefrontal, cortex, hypothalamus, the, sensory, cortex, the, hippocampus, thalamus, septum, and, the, brainstem, the, amygdala, plays, an, important, role, in, ssdr, such, as, the, ventral, amygdalofugal, which, is, essential, for, associative, learning, and, ssdrs, are, learned, through, interaction, with, the, environment, and, others, of, the, same, species, an, emotional, response, is, created, only, after, the, signals, have, been, relayed, between, the, different, regions, of, the, brain, and, activating, the, sympathetic, nervous, systems, which, controls, the, flight, fight, freeze, fright, and, faint, response, often, a, damaged, amygdala, can, cause, impairment, in, the, recognition, of, fear, like, the, human, case, of, patient, s, m, this, impairment, can, cause, different, species, to, lack, the, sensation, of, fear, and, often, can, become, overly, confident, confronting, larger, peers, or, walking, up, to, predatory, creatures, robert, c, bolles, 1970, a, researcher, at, university, of, washington, wanted, to, understand, species, specific, defense, reactions, and, avoidance, learning, among, animals, but, found, that, the, theories, of, avoidance, learning, and, the, tools, that, were, used, to, measure, this, tendency, were, out, of, touch, with, the, natural, world, he, theorized, the, species, specific, defense, reaction, ssdr, there, are, three, forms, of, ssdrs, flight, fight, pseudo, aggression, or, freeze, even, domesticated, animals, have, ssdrs, and, in, those, moments, it, is, seen, that, animals, revert, to, atavistic, standards, and, become, wild, again, dr, bolles, states, that, responses, are, often, dependent, on, the, reinforcement, of, a, safety, signal, and, not, the, aversive, conditioned, stimuli, this, safety, signal, can, be, a, source, of, feedback, or, even, stimulus, change, intrinsic, feedback, or, information, coming, from, within, muscle, twitches, increased, heart, rate, are, seen, to, be, more, important, in, ssdrs, than, extrinsic, feedback, stimuli, that, comes, from, the, external, environment, dr, bolles, found, that, most, creatures, have, some, intrinsic, set, of, fears, to, help, assure, survival, of, the, species, rats, will, run, away, from, any, shocking, event, and, pigeons, will, flap, their, wings, harder, when, threatened, the, wing, flapping, in, pigeons, and, the, scattered, running, of, rats, are, considered, species, specific, defense, reactions, or, behaviors, bolles, believed, that, ssdrs, are, conditioned, through, pavlovian, conditioning, and, not, operant, conditioning, ssdrs, arise, from, the, association, between, the, environmental, stimuli, and, adverse, events, michael, s, fanselow, conducted, an, experiment, to, test, some, specific, defense, reactions, he, observed, that, rats, in, two, different, shock, situations, responded, differently, based, on, instinct, or, defensive, topography, rather, than, contextual, information, species, specific, defense, responses, are, created, out, of, fear, and, are, essential, for, survival, rats, that, lack, the, gene, stathmin, show, no, avoidance, learning, or, a, lack, of, fear, and, will, often, walk, directly, up, to, cats, and, be, eaten, animals, use, these, ssdrs, to, continue, living, to, help, increase, their, chance, of, fitness, by, surviving, long, enough, to, procreate, humans, and, animals, alike, have, created, fear, to, know, what, should, be, avoided, and, this, fear, can, be, learned, through, association, with, others, in, the, community, or, learned, through, personal, experience, with, a, creature, species, or, situations, that, should, be, avoided, ssdrs, are, an, evolutionary, adaptation, that, has, been, seen, in, many, species, throughout, the, world, including, rats, chimpanzees, prairie, dogs, and, even, humans, an, adaptation, created, to, help, individual, creatures, survive, in, a, hostile, world, fear, learning, changes, across, the, lifetime, due, to, natural, developmental, changes, in, the, brain, this, includes, changes, in, the, prefrontal, cortex, and, the, amygdala, the, visual, exploration, of, an, emotional, face, does, not, follow, a, fixed, pattern, but, modulated, by, the, emotional, content, of, the, face, scheller, et, al, found, that, participants, paid, more, attention, to, the, eyes, when, recognising, fearful, or, neutral, faces, while, the, mouth, was, fixated, on, when, happy, faces, are, presented, irrespective, of, task, demands, and, spatial, locations, of, face, stimuli, these, findings, were, replicated, when, fearful, eyes, are, presented, and, when, canonical, face, configurations, are, distorted, for, fearful, neutral, and, happy, expressions, the, brain, structures, that, are, the, center, of, most, neurobiological, events, associated, with, fear, are, the, two, amygdalae, located, behind, the, pituitary, gland, each, amygdala, is, part, of, a, circuitry, of, fear, learning, they, are, essential, for, proper, adaptation, to, stress, and, specific, modulation, of, emotional, learning, memory, in, the, presence, of, a, threatening, stimulus, the, amygdalae, generate, the, secretion, of, hormones, that, influence, fear, and, aggression, once, a, response, to, the, stimulus, in, the, form, of, fear, or, aggression, commences, the, amygdalae, may, elicit, the, release, of, hormones, into, the, body, to, put, the, person, into, a, state, of, alertness, in, which, they, are, ready, to, move, run, fight, etc, this, defensive, response, is, generally, referred, to, in, physiology, as, the, fight, or, flight, response, regulated, by, the, hypothalamus, part, of, the, limbic, system, once, the, person, is, in, safe, mode, meaning, that, there, are, no, longer, any, potential, threats, surrounding, them, the, amygdalae, will, send, this, information, to, the, medial, prefrontal, cortex, mpfc, where, it, is, stored, for, similar, future, situations, which, is, known, as, memory, consolidation, some, of, the, hormones, involved, during, the, state, of, fight, or, flight, include, epinephrine, which, regulates, heart, rate, and, metabolism, as, well, as, dilating, blood, vessels, and, air, passages, norepinephrine, increasing, heart, rate, blood, flow, to, skeletal, muscles, and, the, release, of, glucose, from, energy, stores, and, cortisol, which, increases, blood, sugar, increases, circulating, neutrophilic, leukocytes, calcium, amongst, other, things, after, a, situation, which, incites, fear, occurs, the, amygdalae, and, hippocampus, record, the, event, through, synaptic, plasticity, the, stimulation, to, the, hippocampus, will, cause, the, individual, to, remember, many, details, surrounding, the, situation, plasticity, and, memory, formation, in, the, amygdala, are, generated, by, activation, of, the, neurons, in, the, region, experimental, data, supports, the, notion, that, synaptic, plasticity, of, the, neurons, leading, to, the, lateral, amygdalae, occurs, with, fear, conditioning, in, some, cases, this, forms, permanent, fear, responses, such, as, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, ptsd, or, a, phobia, mri, and, fmri, scans, have, shown, that, the, amygdalae, in, individuals, diagnosed, with, such, disorders, including, bipolar, or, panic, disorder, are, larger, and, wired, for, a, higher, level, of, fear, pathogens, can, suppress, amygdala, activity, rats, infected, with, the, toxoplasmosis, parasite, become, less, fearful, of, cats, sometimes, even, seeking, out, their, urine, marked, areas, this, behavior, often, leads, to, them, being, eaten, by, cats, the, parasite, then, reproduces, within, the, body, of, the, cat, there, is, evidence, that, the, parasite, concentrates, itself, in, the, amygdala, of, infected, rats, in, a, separate, experiment, rats, with, lesions, in, the, amygdala, did, not, express, fear, or, anxiety, towards, unwanted, stimuli, these, rats, pulled, on, levers, supplying, food, that, sometimes, sent, out, electrical, shocks, while, they, learned, to, avoid, pressing, on, them, they, did, not, distance, themselves, from, these, shock, inducing, levers, several, brain, structures, other, than, the, amygdalae, have, also, been, observed, to, be, activated, when, individuals, are, presented, with, fearful, vs, neutral, faces, namely, the, occipito, cerebellar, regions, including, the, fusiform, gyrus, and, the, inferior, parietal, superior, temporal, gyri, fearful, eyes, brows, and, mouth, seem, to, separately, reproduce, these, brain, responses, scientists, from, zurich, studies, show, that, the, hormone, oxytocin, related, to, stress, and, sex, reduces, activity, in, your, brain, fear, center, in, threatening, situations, insects, aquatic, organisms, birds, reptiles, and, mammals, emit, odorant, substances, initially, called, alarm, substances, which, are, chemical, signals, now, called, alarm, pheromones, this, is, to, defend, themselves, and, at, the, same, time, to, inform, members, of, the, same, species, of, danger, and, leads, to, observable, behavior, change, like, freezing, defensive, behavior, or, dispersion, depending, on, circumstances, and, species, for, example, stressed, rats, release, odorant, cues, that, cause, other, rats, to, move, away, from, the, source, of, the, signal, after, the, discovery, of, pheromones, in, 1959, alarm, pheromones, were, first, described, in, 1968, in, ants, and, earthworms, and, four, years, later, also, found, in, mammals, both, mice, and, rats, over, the, next, two, decades, identification, and, characterization, of, these, pheromones, proceeded, in, all, manner, of, insects, and, sea, animals, including, fish, but, it, was, not, until, 1990, that, more, insight, into, mammalian, alarm, pheromones, was, gleaned, in, 1985, a, link, between, odors, released, by, stressed, rats, and, pain, perception, was, discovered, unstressed, rats, exposed, to, these, odors, developed, opioid, mediated, analgesia, in, 1997, researchers, found, that, bees, became, less, responsive, to, pain, after, they, had, been, stimulated, with, isoamyl, acetate, a, chemical, smelling, of, banana, and, a, component, of, bee, alarm, pheromone, the, experiment, also, showed, that, the, bees, fear, induced, pain, tolerance, was, mediated, by, an, endorphin, by, using, the, forced, swimming, test, in, rats, as, a, model, of, fear, induction, the, first, mammalian, alarm, substance, was, found, in, 1991, this, alarm, substance, was, shown, to, fulfill, criteria, for, pheromones, well, defined, behavioral, effect, species, specificity, minimal, influence, of, experience, and, control, for, nonspecific, arousal, rat, activity, testing, with, the, alarm, pheromone, and, their, preference, avoidance, for, odors, from, cylinders, containing, the, pheromone, showed, that, the, pheromone, had, very, low, volatility, in, 1993, a, connection, between, alarm, chemosignals, in, mice, and, their, immune, response, was, found, pheromone, production, in, mice, was, found, to, be, associated, with, or, mediated, by, the, pituitary, gland, in, 1994, in, 2004, it, was, demonstrated, that, rats, alarm, pheromones, had, different, effects, on, the, recipient, rat, the, rat, perceiving, the, pheromone, depending, which, body, region, they, were, released, from, pheromone, production, from, the, face, modified, behavior, in, the, recipient, rat, e, g, caused, sniffing, or, movement, whereas, pheromone, secreted, from, the, rat, s, anal, area, induced, autonomic, nervous, system, stress, responses, like, an, increase, in, core, body, temperature, further, experiments, showed, that, when, a, rat, perceived, alarm, pheromones, it, increased, its, defensive, and, risk, assessment, behavior, and, its, acoustic, startle, reflex, was, enhanced, it, was, not, until, 2011, that, a, link, between, severe, pain, neuroinflammation, and, alarm, pheromones, release, in, rats, was, found, real, time, rt, pcr, analysis, of, rat, brain, tissues, indicated, that, shocking, the, footpad, of, a, rat, increased, its, production, of, proinflammatory, cytokines, in, deep, brain, structures, namely, of, il, 1, heteronuclear, corticotropin, releasing, hormone, and, c, fos, mrna, expressions, in, both, the, paraventricular, nucleus, and, the, bed, nucleus, of, the, stria, terminalis, and, it, increased, stress, hormone, levels, in, plasma, corticosterone, the, neurocircuit, for, how, rats, perceive, alarm, pheromones, was, shown, to, be, related, to, the, hypothalamus, brainstem, and, amygdalae, all, of, which, are, evolutionary, ancient, structures, deep, inside, or, in, the, case, of, the, brainstem, underneath, the, brain, away, from, the, cortex, and, involved, in, the, fight, or, flight, response, as, is, the, case, in, humans, alarm, pheromone, induced, anxiety, in, rats, has, been, used, to, evaluate, the, degree, to, which, anxiolytics, can, alleviate, anxiety, in, humans, for, this, the, change, in, the, acoustic, startle, reflex, of, rats, with, alarm, pheromone, induced, anxiety, i, e, reduction, of, defensiveness, has, been, measured, pretreatment, of, rats, with, one, of, five, anxiolytics, used, in, clinical, medicine, was, able, to, reduce, their, anxiety, namely, midazolam, phenelzine, a, nonselective, monoamine, oxidase, mao, inhibitor, propranolol, a, nonselective, beta, blocker, clonidine, an, alpha, 2, adrenergic, agonist, or, cp, 154, 526, a, corticotropin, releasing, hormone, antagonist, faulty, development, of, odor, discrimination, impairs, the, perception, of, pheromones, and, pheromone, related, behavior, like, aggressive, behavior, and, mating, in, male, rats, the, enzyme, mitogen, activated, protein, kinase, 7, mapk7, has, been, implicated, in, regulating, the, development, of, the, olfactory, bulb, and, odor, discrimination, and, it, is, highly, expressed, in, developing, rat, brains, but, absent, in, most, regions, of, adult, rat, brains, conditional, deletion, of, the, mapk7gene, in, mouse, neural, stem, cells, impairs, several, pheromone, mediated, behaviors, including, aggression, and, mating, in, male, mice, these, behavior, impairments, were, not, caused, by, a, reduction, in, the, level, of, testosterone, by, physical, immobility, by, heightened, fear, or, anxiety, or, by, depression, using, mouse, urine, as, a, natural, pheromone, containing, solution, it, has, been, shown, that, the, impairment, was, associated, with, defective, detection, of, related, pheromones, and, with, changes, in, their, inborn, preference, for, pheromones, related, to, sexual, and, reproductive, activities, lastly, alleviation, of, an, acute, fear, response, because, a, friendly, peer, or, in, biological, language, an, affiliative, conspecific, tends, and, befriends, is, called, social, buffering, the, term, is, in, analogy, to, the, 1985, buffering, hypothesis, in, psychology, where, social, support, has, been, proven, to, mitigate, the, negative, health, effects, of, alarm, pheromone, mediated, distress, the, role, of, a, social, pheromone, is, suggested, by, the, recent, discovery, that, olfactory, signals, are, responsible, in, mediating, the, social, buffering, in, male, rats, social, buffering, was, also, observed, to, mitigate, the, conditioned, fear, responses, of, honeybees, a, bee, colony, exposed, to, an, environment, of, high, threat, of, predation, did, not, show, increased, aggression, and, aggressive, like, gene, expression, patterns, in, individual, bees, but, decreased, aggression, that, the, bees, did, not, simply, habituate, to, threats, is, suggested, by, the, fact, that, the, disturbed, colonies, also, decreased, their, foraging, biologists, have, proposed, in, 2012, that, fear, pheromones, evolved, as, molecules, of, keystone, significance, a, term, coined, in, analogy, to, keystone, species, pheromones, may, determine, species, compositions, and, affect, rates, of, energy, and, material, exchange, in, an, ecological, community, thus, pheromones, generate, structure, in, a, food, web, and, play, critical, roles, in, maintaining, natural, systems, evidence, of, chemosensory, alarm, signals, in, humans, has, emerged, slowly, although, alarm, pheromones, have, not, been, physically, isolated, and, their, chemical, structures, have, not, been, identified, in, humans, so, far, there, is, evidence, for, their, presence, androstadienone, for, example, a, steroidal, endogenous, odorant, is, a, pheromone, candidate, found, in, human, sweat, axillary, hair, and, plasma, the, closely, related, compound, androstenone, is, involved, in, communicating, dominance, aggression, or, competition, sex, hormone, influences, on, androstenone, perception, in, humans, showed, a, high, testosterone, level, related, to, heightened, androstenone, sensitivity, in, men, a, high, testosterone, level, related, to, unhappiness, in, response, to, androstenone, in, men, and, a, high, estradiol, level, related, to, disliking, of, androstenone, in, women, a, german, study, from, 2006, showed, when, anxiety, induced, versus, exercise, induced, human, sweat, from, a, dozen, people, was, pooled, and, offered, to, seven, study, participants, of, five, able, to, olfactorily, distinguish, exercise, induced, sweat, from, room, air, three, could, also, distinguish, exercise, induced, sweat, from, anxiety, induced, sweat, the, acoustic, startle, reflex, response, to, a, sound, when, sensing, anxiety, sweat, was, larger, than, when, sensing, exercise, induced, sweat, as, measured, by, electromyography, analysis, of, the, orbital, muscle, which, is, responsible, for, the, eyeblink, component, this, showed, for, the, first, time, that, fear, chemosignals, can, modulate, the, startle, reflex, in, humans, without, emotional, mediation, fear, chemosignals, primed, the, recipient, s, defensive, behavior, prior, to, the, subjects, conscious, attention, on, the, acoustic, startle, reflex, level, in, analogy, to, the, social, buffering, of, rats, and, honeybees, in, response, to, chemosignals, induction, of, empathy, by, smelling, anxiety, of, another, person, has, been, found, in, humans, a, study, from, 2013, provided, brain, imaging, evidence, that, human, responses, to, fear, chemosignals, may, be, gender, specific, researchers, collected, alarm, induced, sweat, and, exercise, induced, sweat, from, donors, extracted, it, pooled, it, and, presented, it, to, 16, unrelated, people, undergoing, functional, brain, mri, while, stress, induced, sweat, from, males, produced, a, comparably, strong, emotional, response, in, both, females, and, males, stress, induced, sweat, from, females, produced, markedly, stronger, arousal, in, women, than, in, men, statistical, tests, pinpointed, this, gender, specificity, to, the, right, amygdala, and, strongest, in, the, superficial, nuclei, since, no, significant, differences, were, found, in, the, olfactory, bulb, the, response, to, female, fear, induced, signals, is, likely, based, on, processing, the, meaning, i, e, on, the, emotional, level, rather, than, the, strength, of, chemosensory, cues, from, each, gender, i, e, the, perceptual, level, an, approach, avoidance, task, was, set, up, where, volunteers, seeing, either, an, angry, or, a, happy, cartoon, face, on, a, computer, screen, pushed, away, or, pulled, toward, them, a, joystick, as, fast, as, possible, volunteers, smelling, androstadienone, masked, with, clove, oil, scent, responded, faster, especially, to, angry, faces, than, those, smelling, clove, oil, only, which, was, interpreted, as, androstadienone, related, activation, of, the, fear, system, a, potential, mechanism, of, action, is, that, androstadienone, alters, the, emotional, face, processing, androstadienone, is, known, to, influence, the, activity, of, the, fusiform, gyrus, which, is, relevant, for, face, recognition, cognitive, consistency, theories, assume, that, when, two, or, more, simultaneously, active, cognitive, structures, are, logically, inconsistent, arousal, is, increased, which, activates, processes, with, the, expected, consequence, of, increasing, consistency, and, decreasing, arousal, in, this, context, it, has, been, proposed, that, fear, behavior, is, caused, by, an, inconsistency, between, a, preferred, or, expected, situation, and, the, actually, perceived, situation, and, functions, to, remove, the, inconsistent, stimulus, from, the, perceptual, field, for, instance, by, fleeing, or, hiding, thereby, resolving, the, inconsistency, this, approach, puts, fear, in, a, broader, perspective, also, involving, aggression, and, curiosity, when, the, inconsistency, between, perception, and, expectancy, is, small, learning, as, a, result, of, curiosity, reduces, inconsistency, by, updating, expectancy, to, match, perception, if, the, inconsistency, is, larger, fear, or, aggressive, behavior, may, be, employed, to, alter, the, perception, in, order, to, make, it, match, expectancy, depending, on, the, size, of, the, inconsistency, as, well, as, the, specific, context, aggressive, behavior, is, assumed, to, alter, perception, by, forcefully, manipulating, it, into, matching, the, expected, situation, while, in, some, cases, thwarted, escape, may, also, trigger, aggressive, behavior, in, an, attempt, to, remove, the, thwarting, stimulus, in, order, to, improve, our, understanding, of, the, neural, and, behavioral, mechanisms, of, adaptive, and, maladaptive, fear, investigators, use, a, variety, of, translational, animal, models, these, models, are, particularly, important, for, research, that, would, be, too, invasive, for, human, studies, rodents, such, as, mice, and, rats, are, common, animal, models, but, other, species, are, used, certain, aspects, of, fear, research, still, requires, more, research, such, as, sex, gender, and, age, differences, these, animal, models, include, but, are, not, limited, to, fear, conditioning, predator, based, psychosocial, stress, single, prolonged, stress, chronic, stress, models, inescapable, foot, tail, shocks, immobilization, or, restraint, and, stress, enhanced, fear, learning, while, the, stress, and, fear, paradigms, differ, between, the, models, they, tend, to, involve, aspects, such, as, acquisition, generalization, extinction, cognitive, regulation, and, reconsolidation, fear, conditioning, also, known, as, pavlovian, or, classical, conditioning, is, a, process, of, learning, that, involves, pairing, a, neutral, stimulus, with, an, unconditional, stimulus, us, a, neutral, stimulus, is, something, like, a, bell, tone, or, room, that, does, not, illicit, a, response, normally, where, a, us, is, a, stimulus, that, results, in, a, natural, or, unconditioned, response, ur, in, pavlov, s, famous, experiment, the, neutral, stimulus, is, a, bell, and, the, us, would, be, food, with, the, dog, s, salvation, being, the, ur, pairing, the, neutral, stimulus, and, the, us, results, in, the, ur, occurring, not, only, with, the, us, but, also, the, neutral, stimulus, when, this, occurs, the, neutral, stimulus, is, referred, to, as, the, conditional, stimulus, cs, and, the, response, the, conditional, response, cr, in, the, fear, conditioning, model, of, pavlovian, conditioning, the, us, is, an, aversive, stimulus, such, as, a, shock, tone, or, unpleasant, odor, predator, based, psychosocial, stress, pps, involves, a, more, naturalistic, approach, to, fear, learning, predators, such, as, a, cat, a, snake, or, urine, from, a, fox, or, cat, are, used, along, with, other, stressors, such, as, immobilization, or, restraint, in, order, to, generate, instinctual, fear, responses, chronic, stress, models, include, chronic, variable, stress, chronic, social, defeat, and, chronic, mild, stress, these, models, are, often, used, to, study, how, long, term, or, prolonged, stress, pain, can, alter, fear, learning, and, disorders, single, prolonged, stress, sps, is, a, fear, model, that, is, often, used, to, study, ptsd, its, paradigm, involves, multiple, stressors, such, as, immobilization, a, force, swim, and, exposure, to, ether, delivered, concurrently, to, the, subject, this, is, used, to, study, non, naturalistic, uncontrollable, situations, that, can, cause, a, maladaptive, fear, responses, that, is, seen, in, a, lot, of, anxiety, and, traumatic, based, disorders, stress, enhanced, fear, learning, sefl, like, sps, is, often, used, to, study, the, maladaptive, fear, learning, involved, in, ptsd, and, other, traumatic, based, disorders, sefl, involves, a, single, extreme, stressor, such, as, a, large, number, of, footshocks, simulating, a, single, traumatic, stressor, that, somehow, enhances, and, alters, future, fear, learning, a, drug, treatment, for, fear, conditioning, and, phobias, via, the, amygdalae, is, the, use, of, glucocorticoids, in, one, study, glucocorticoid, receptors, in, the, central, nuclei, of, the, amygdalae, were, disrupted, in, order, to, better, understand, the, mechanisms, of, fear, and, fear, conditioning, the, glucocorticoid, receptors, were, inhibited, using, lentiviral, vectors, containing, cre, recombinase, injected, into, mice, results, showed, that, disruption, of, the, glucocorticoid, receptors, prevented, conditioned, fear, behavior, the, mice, were, subjected, to, auditory, cues, which, caused, them, to, freeze, normally, a, reduction, of, freezing, was, observed, in, the, mice, that, had, inhibited, glucocorticoid, receptors, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, has, been, successful, in, helping, people, overcome, their, fear, because, fear, is, more, complex, than, just, forgetting, or, deleting, memories, an, active, and, successful, approach, involves, people, repeatedly, confronting, their, fears, by, confronting, their, fears, in, a, safe, manner, a, person, can, suppress, the, fear, triggering, memories, or, stimuli, exposure, therapy, has, known, to, have, helped, up, to, 90, of, people, with, specific, phobias, to, significantly, decrease, their, fear, over, time, another, psychological, treatment, is, systematic, desensitization, which, is, a, type, of, behavior, therapy, used, to, completely, remove, the, fear, or, produce, a, disgusted, response, to, this, fear, and, replace, it, the, replacement, that, occurs, will, be, relaxation, and, will, occur, through, conditioning, through, conditioning, treatments, muscle, tensioning, will, lessen, and, deep, breathing, techniques, will, aid, in, de, tensioning, there, are, other, methods, for, treating, or, coping, with, one, s, fear, such, as, writing, down, rational, thoughts, regarding, fears, journal, entries, are, a, healthy, method, of, expressing, one, s, fears, without, compromising, safety, or, causing, uncertainty, another, suggestion, is, a, fear, ladder, to, create, a, fear, ladder, one, must, write, down, all, of, their, fears, and, score, them, on, a, scale, of, one, to, ten, next, the, person, addresses, their, phobia, starting, with, the, lowest, number, religion, can, help, some, individuals, cope, with, fear, people, who, have, damage, to, their, amygdalae, which, can, be, caused, by, a, rare, genetic, disease, known, as, urbach, wiethe, disease, are, unable, to, experience, fear, the, disease, destroys, both, amygdalae, in, late, childhood, since, the, discovery, of, the, disease, there, have, only, been, 400, recorded, cases, a, lack, of, fear, can, allow, someone, to, get, into, a, dangerous, situation, they, otherwise, would, have, avoided, the, fear, of, the, end, of, life, and, its, existence, is, in, other, words, the, fear, of, death, historically, attempts, were, made, to, reduce, this, fear, by, performing, rituals, which, have, helped, collect, the, cultural, ideas, that, we, now, have, in, the, present, these, rituals, also, helped, preserve, the, cultural, ideas, the, results, and, methods, of, human, existence, had, been, changing, at, the, same, time, that, social, formation, was, changing, when, people, are, faced, with, their, own, thoughts, of, death, they, either, accept, that, they, are, dying, or, will, die, because, they, have, lived, a, full, life, or, they, will, experience, fear, a, theory, was, developed, in, response, to, this, which, is, called, the, terror, management, theory, the, theory, states, that, a, person, s, cultural, worldviews, religion, values, etc, will, mitigate, the, terror, associated, with, the, fear, of, death, through, avoidance, to, help, manage, their, terror, they, find, solace, in, their, death, denying, beliefs, such, as, their, religion, another, way, people, cope, with, their, death, related, fears, is, pushing, any, thoughts, of, death, into, the, future, or, by, avoiding, these, thoughts, all, together, through, distractions, although, there, are, methods, for, one, coping, with, the, terror, associated, with, their, fear, of, death, not, everyone, suffers, from, these, same, uncertainties, people, who, believe, they, have, lived, life, to, the, fullest, typically, do, not, fear, death, death, anxiety, is, multidimensional, it, covers, fears, related, to, one, s, own, death, the, death, of, others, fear, of, the, unknown, after, death, fear, of, obliteration, and, fear, of, the, dying, process, which, includes, fear, of, a, slow, death, and, a, painful, death, the, yale, philosopher, shelly, kagan, examined, fear, of, death, in, a, 2007, yale, open, course, by, examining, the, following, questions, is, fear, of, death, a, reasonable, appropriate, response, what, conditions, are, required, and, what, are, appropriate, conditions, for, feeling, fear, of, death, what, is, meant, by, fear, and, how, much, fear, is, appropriate, according, to, kagan, for, fear, in, general, to, make, sense, three, conditions, should, be, met, the, amount, of, fear, should, be, appropriate, to, the, size, of, the, bad, if, the, three, conditions, are, not, met, fear, is, an, inappropriate, emotion, he, argues, that, death, does, not, meet, the, first, two, criteria, even, if, death, is, a, deprivation, of, good, things, and, even, if, one, believes, in, a, painful, afterlife, because, death, is, certain, it, also, does, not, meet, the, third, criterion, but, he, grants, that, the, unpredictability, of, when, one, dies, may, be, cause, to, a, sense, of, fear, in, a, 2003, study, of, 167, women, and, 121, men, aged, 65, 87, low, self, efficacy, predicted, fear, of, the, unknown, after, death, and, fear, of, dying, for, women, and, men, better, than, demographics, social, support, and, physical, health, fear, of, death, was, measured, by, a, multidimensional, fear, of, death, scale, which, included, the, 8, subscales, fear, of, dying, fear, of, the, dead, fear, of, being, destroyed, fear, for, significant, others, fear, of, the, unknown, fear, of, conscious, death, fear, for, the, body, after, death, and, fear, of, premature, death, in, hierarchical, multiple, regression, analysis, the, most, potent, predictors, of, death, fears, were, low, spiritual, health, efficacy, defined, as, beliefs, relating, to, one, s, perceived, ability, to, generate, spiritually, based, faith, and, inner, strength, and, low, instrumental, efficacy, defined, as, beliefs, relating, to, one, s, perceived, ability, to, manage, activities, of, daily, living, psychologists, have, tested, the, hypotheses, that, fear, of, death, motivates, religious, commitment, and, that, assurances, about, an, afterlife, alleviate, the, fear, with, equivocal, results, religiosity, can, be, related, to, fear, of, death, when, the, afterlife, is, portrayed, as, time, of, punishment, intrinsic, religiosity, as, opposed, to, mere, formal, religious, involvement, has, been, found, to, be, negatively, correlated, with, death, anxiety, in, a, 1976, study, of, people, of, various, christian, denominations, those, who, were, most, firm, in, their, faith, who, attended, religious, services, weekly, were, the, least, afraid, of, dying, the, survey, found, a, negative, correlation, between, fear, of, death, and, religious, concern, in, a, 2006, study, of, white, christian, men, and, women, the, hypothesis, was, tested, that, traditional, church, centered, religiousness, and, de, institutionalized, spiritual, seeking, are, ways, of, approaching, fear, of, death, in, old, age, both, religiousness, and, spirituality, were, related, to, positive, psychosocial, functioning, but, only, church, centered, religiousness, protected, subjects, against, the, fear, of, death, statius, in, the, thebaid, book, 3, line, 661, aired, the, irreverent, suggestion, that, fear, first, made, gods, in, the, world, from, a, christian, theological, perspective, the, word, fear, can, encompass, more, than, simple, dread, robert, b, strimple, says, that, fear, includes, the, convergence, of, awe, reverence, adoration, humility, some, translations, of, the, bible, such, as, the, new, international, version, sometimes, express, the, concept, of, fear, with, the, word, reverence, a, similar, phrase, god, fearing, is, sometimes, used, as, a, rough, synonym, for, pious, it, is, a, standard, translation, for, the, arabic, word, taqwa, arabic, forbearance, restraint, in, muslim, contexts, in, judaism, fear, of, god, describes, obedience, to, jewish, law, even, when, invisible, to, others, fear, may, be, politically, and, culturally, manipulated, to, persuade, citizenry, of, ideas, which, would, otherwise, be, widely, rejected, or, dissuade, citizenry, from, ideas, which, would, otherwise, be, widely, supported, in, contexts, of, disasters, nation, states, manage, the, fear, not, only, to, provide, their, citizens, with, an, explanation, about, the, event, or, blaming, some, minorities, but, also, to, adjust, their, previous, beliefs, fear, can, alter, how, a, person, thinks, or, reacts, to, situations, because, fear, has, the, power, to, inhibit, one, s, rational, way, of, thinking, as, a, result, people, who, do, not, experience, fear, are, able, to, use, fear, as, a, tool, to, manipulate, others, people, who, are, experiencing, fear, seek, preservation, through, safety, and, can, be, manipulated, by, a, person, who, is, there, to, provide, that, safety, that, is, being, sought, after, when, we, re, afraid, a, manipulator, can, talk, us, out, of, the, truth, we, see, right, in, front, of, us, words, become, more, real, than, reality, by, this, a, manipulator, can, use, our, fear, to, manipulate, us, out, the, truth, and, instead, make, us, believe, and, trust, in, their, truth, politicians, are, notorious, for, using, fear, to, manipulate, the, people, into, supporting, their, policies, this, strategy, taps, into, primal, human, emotions, leveraging, fear, of, the, unknown, external, threats, or, perceived, dangers, to, influence, decision, making, fear, is, found, and, reflected, in, mythology, and, folklore, as, well, as, in, works, of, fiction, such, as, novels, and, films, works, of, dystopian, and, post, apocalyptic, fiction, convey, the, fears, and, anxieties, of, societies, the, fear, of, the, world, s, end, is, about, as, old, as, civilization, itself, in, a, 1967, study, frank, kermode, suggests, that, the, failure, of, religious, prophecies, led, to, a, shift, in, how, society, apprehends, this, ancient, mode, scientific, and, critical, thought, supplanting, religious, and, mythical, thought, as, well, as, a, public, emancipation, may, be, the, cause, of, eschatology, becoming, replaced, by, more, realistic, scenarios, such, might, constructively, provoke, discussion, and, steps, to, be, taken, to, prevent, depicted, catastrophes, the, story, of, the, youth, who, went, forth, to, learn, what, fear, was, is, a, german, fairy, tale, dealing, with, the, topic, of, not, knowing, fear, many, stories, also, include, characters, who, fear, the, antagonist, of, the, plot, one, important, characteristic, of, historical, and, mythical, heroes, across, cultures, is, to, be, fearless, in, the, face, of, big, and, often, lethal, enemies, the, magnus, archives, is, a, fiction, horror, podcast, written, by, jonathan, sims, and, directed, by, alexander, j, newall, that, among, other, things, formulates, an, archetypal, ontology, of, fear, through, the, dissemination, of, case, files, at, a, paranormal, research, institute, set, in, a, world, where, the, metaphysical, basis, of, paranormal, activity, and, unexplainable, horrors, is, fear, incarnate, the, diegesis, states, that, true, categorization, of, fear, is, impossible, that, fear, is, all, one, unknowable, thing, however, there, exists, an, ontological, structure, of, fear, archetypes, in, this, universe, proposed, by, a, fictional, version, of, the, architect, robert, smirke, it, is, a, unique, construction, of, fear, in, that, it, is, not, based, on, the, science, or, neurology, of, fear, but, on, thematic, and, experiential, connections, between, different, phobias, for, example, the, fear, of, disease, and, vermin, comes, from, the, same, place, as, the, fear, of, abusive, relationships, as, both, lie, in, fearing, corruptions, to, the, self, the, final, season, of, the, podcast, consists, almost, entirely, of, poetic, meditations, on, the, nature, of, fear, in, the, world, of, athletics, fear, is, often, used, as, a, means, of, motivation, to, not, fail, this, situation, involves, using, fear, in, a, way, that, increases, the, chances, of, a, positive, outcome, in, this, case, the, fear, that, is, being, created, is, initially, a, cognitive, state, to, the, receiver, this, initial, state, is, what, generates, the, first, response, of, the, athlete, this, response, generates, a, possibility, of, fight, or, flight, reaction, by, the, athlete, receiver, which, in, turn, will, increase, or, decrease, the, possibility, of, success, or, failure, in, the, certain, situation, for, the, athlete, the, amount, of, time, that, the, athlete, has, to, determine, this, decision, is, small, but, it, is, still, enough, time, for, the, receiver, to, make, a, determination, through, cognition, even, though, the, decision, is, made, quickly, the, decision, is, determined, through, past, events, that, have, been, experienced, by, the, athlete, the, results, of, these, past, events, will, determine, how, the, athlete, will, make, his, cognitive, decision, in, the, split, second, that, he, or, she, has, fear, of, failure, as, described, above, has, been, studied, frequently, in, the, field, of, sport, psychology, many, scholars, have, tried, to, determine, how, often, fear, of, failure, is, triggered, within, athletes, as, well, as, what, personalities, of, athletes, most, often, choose, to, use, this, type, of, motivation, studies, have, also, been, conducted, to, determine, the, success, rate, of, this, method, of, motivation, murray, s, exploration, in, personal, 1938, was, one, of, the, first, studies, that, actually, identified, fear, of, failure, as, an, actual, motive, to, avoid, failure, or, to, achieve, success, his, studies, suggested, that, inavoidance, the, need, to, avoid, failure, was, found, in, many, college, aged, men, during, the, time, of, his, research, in, 1938, this, was, a, monumental, finding, in, the, field, of, psychology, because, it, allowed, other, researchers, to, better, clarify, how, fear, of, failure, can, actually, be, a, determinant, of, creating, achievement, goals, as, well, as, how, it, could, be, used, in, the, actual, act, of, achievement, in, the, context, of, sport, a, model, was, created, by, r, s, lazarus, in, 1991, that, uses, the, cognitive, motivational, relational, theory, of, emotion, it, holds, that, fear, of, failure, results, when, beliefs, or, cognitive, schemas, about, aversive, consequences, of, failing, are, activated, by, situations, in, which, failure, is, possible, these, belief, systems, predispose, the, individual, to,
