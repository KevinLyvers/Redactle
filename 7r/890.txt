a, civil, war, is, a, war, between, organized, groups, within, the, same, state, or, country, the, aim, of, one, side, may, be, to, take, control, of, the, country, or, a, region, to, achieve, independence, for, a, region, or, to, change, government, policies, the, term, is, a, calque, of, latin, bellum, civile, which, was, used, to, refer, to, the, various, civil, wars, of, the, roman, republic, in, the, 1st, century, bc, most, modern, civil, wars, involve, intervention, by, outside, powers, according, to, patrick, m, regan, in, his, book, civil, wars, and, foreign, powers, 2000, about, two, thirds, of, the, 138, intrastate, conflicts, between, the, end, of, world, war, ii, and, 2000, saw, international, intervention, a, civil, war, is, often, a, high, intensity, conflict, often, involving, regular, armed, forces, that, is, sustained, organized, and, large, scale, civil, wars, may, result, in, large, numbers, of, casualties, and, the, consumption, of, significant, resources, civil, wars, since, the, end, of, world, war, ii, have, lasted, on, average, just, over, four, years, a, dramatic, rise, from, the, one, and, a, half, year, average, of, the, 1900, 1944, period, while, the, rate, of, emergence, of, new, civil, wars, has, been, relatively, steady, since, the, mid, 19th, century, the, increasing, length, of, those, wars, has, resulted, in, increasing, numbers, of, wars, ongoing, at, any, one, time, for, example, there, were, no, more, than, five, civil, wars, underway, simultaneously, in, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, while, there, were, over, 20, concurrent, civil, wars, close, to, the, end, of, the, cold, war, since, 1945, civil, wars, have, resulted, in, the, deaths, of, over, 25, million, people, as, well, as, the, forced, displacement, of, millions, more, civil, wars, have, further, resulted, in, economic, collapse, somalia, burma, myanmar, uganda, and, angola, are, examples, of, nations, that, were, considered, to, have, had, promising, futures, before, being, engulfed, in, civil, wars, james, fearon, a, scholar, of, civil, wars, at, stanford, university, defines, a, civil, war, as, a, violent, conflict, within, a, country, fought, by, organized, groups, that, aim, to, take, power, at, the, center, or, in, a, region, or, to, change, government, policies, ann, hironaka, further, specifies, that, one, side, of, a, civil, war, is, the, state, stathis, kalyvas, defines, civil, war, as, armed, combat, taking, place, within, the, boundaries, of, a, recognized, sovereign, entity, between, parties, that, are, subject, to, a, common, authority, at, the, outset, of, the, hostilities, the, intensity, at, which, a, civil, disturbance, becomes, a, civil, war, is, contested, by, academics, some, political, scientists, define, a, civil, war, as, having, more, than, 1, 000, casualties, while, others, further, specify, that, at, least, 100, must, come, from, each, side, the, correlates, of, war, a, dataset, widely, used, by, scholars, of, conflict, classifies, civil, wars, as, having, over, 1000, war, related, casualties, per, year, of, conflict, this, rate, is, a, small, fraction, of, the, millions, killed, in, the, second, sudanese, civil, war, and, cambodian, civil, war, for, example, but, excludes, several, highly, publicized, conflicts, such, as, the, troubles, of, northern, ireland, and, the, struggle, of, the, african, national, congress, in, apartheid, era, south, africa, based, on, the, 1, 000, casualties, per, year, criterion, there, were, 213, civil, wars, from, 1816, to, 1997, 104, of, which, occurred, from, 1944, to, 1997, if, one, uses, the, less, stringent, 1, 000, casualties, total, criterion, there, were, over, 90, civil, wars, between, 1945, and, 2007, with, 20, ongoing, civil, wars, as, of, 2007, the, geneva, conventions, do, not, specifically, define, the, term, civil, war, nevertheless, they, do, outline, the, responsibilities, of, parties, in, armed, conflict, not, of, an, international, character, this, includes, civil, wars, however, no, specific, definition, of, civil, war, is, provided, in, the, text, of, the, conventions, nevertheless, the, international, committee, of, the, red, cross, has, sought, to, provide, some, clarification, through, its, commentaries, on, the, geneva, conventions, noting, that, the, conventions, are, so, general, so, vague, that, many, of, the, delegations, feared, that, it, might, be, taken, to, cover, any, act, committed, by, force, of, arms, accordingly, the, commentaries, provide, for, different, conditions, on, which, the, application, of, the, geneva, convention, would, depend, the, commentary, however, points, out, that, these, should, not, be, interpreted, as, rigid, conditions, the, conditions, listed, by, the, icrc, in, its, commentary, are, as, follows, 1, that, the, party, in, revolt, against, the, de, jure, government, possesses, an, organized, military, force, an, authority, responsible, for, its, acts, acting, within, a, determinate, territory, and, having, the, means, of, respecting, and, ensuring, respect, for, the, convention, 2, that, the, legal, government, is, obliged, to, have, recourse, to, the, regular, military, forces, against, insurgents, organized, as, military, and, in, possession, of, a, part, of, the, national, territory, 3, a, that, the, de, jure, government, has, recognized, the, insurgents, as, belligerents, b, that, it, has, claimed, for, itself, the, rights, of, a, belligerent, or, c, that, it, has, accorded, the, insurgents, recognition, as, belligerents, for, the, purposes, only, of, the, present, convention, or, d, that, the, dispute, has, been, admitted, to, the, agenda, of, the, security, council, or, the, general, assembly, of, the, united, nations, as, being, a, threat, to, international, peace, a, breach, of, the, peace, or, an, act, of, aggression, 4, a, that, the, insurgents, have, an, organization, purporting, to, have, the, characteristics, of, a, state, b, that, the, insurgent, civil, authority, exercises, de, facto, authority, over, the, population, within, a, determinate, portion, of, the, national, territory, c, that, the, armed, forces, act, under, the, direction, of, an, organized, authority, and, are, prepared, to, observe, the, ordinary, laws, of, war, d, that, the, insurgent, civil, authority, agrees, to, be, bound, by, the, provisions, of, the, convention, according, to, a, 2017, review, study, of, civil, war, research, there, are, three, prominent, explanations, for, civil, war, greed, based, explanations, which, center, on, individuals, desire, to, maximize, their, profits, grievance, based, explanations, which, center, on, conflict, as, a, response, to, socioeconomic, or, political, injustice, and, opportunity, based, explanations, which, center, on, factors, that, make, it, easier, to, engage, in, violent, mobilization, according, to, the, study, the, most, influential, explanation, for, civil, war, onset, is, the, opportunity, based, explanation, by, james, fearon, and, david, laitin, in, their, 2003, american, political, science, review, article, scholars, investigating, the, cause, of, civil, war, are, attracted, by, two, opposing, theories, greed, versus, grievance, roughly, stated, are, conflicts, caused, by, differences, of, ethnicity, religion, or, other, social, affiliation, or, do, conflicts, begin, because, it, is, in, the, economic, best, interests, of, individuals, and, groups, to, start, them, scholarly, analysis, supports, the, conclusion, that, economic, and, structural, factors, are, more, important, than, those, of, identity, in, predicting, occurrences, of, civil, war, a, comprehensive, study, of, civil, war, was, carried, out, by, a, team, from, the, world, bank, in, the, early, 21st, century, the, study, framework, which, came, to, be, called, the, collier, hoeffler, model, examined, 78, five, year, increments, when, civil, war, occurred, from, 1960, to, 1999, as, well, as, 1, 167, five, year, increments, of, no, civil, war, for, comparison, and, subjected, the, data, set, to, regression, analysis, to, see, the, effect, of, various, factors, the, factors, that, were, shown, to, have, a, statistically, significant, effect, on, the, chance, that, a, civil, war, would, occur, in, any, given, five, year, period, were, a, high, proportion, of, primary, commodities, in, national, exports, significantly, increases, the, risk, of, a, conflict, a, country, at, peak, danger, with, commodities, comprising, 32, of, gross, domestic, product, has, a, 22, risk, of, falling, into, civil, war, in, a, given, five, year, period, while, a, country, with, no, primary, commodity, exports, has, a, 1, risk, when, disaggregated, only, petroleum, and, non, petroleum, groupings, showed, different, results, a, country, with, relatively, low, levels, of, dependence, on, petroleum, exports, is, at, slightly, less, risk, while, a, high, level, of, dependence, on, oil, as, an, export, results, in, slightly, more, risk, of, a, civil, war, than, national, dependence, on, another, primary, commodity, the, authors, of, the, study, interpreted, this, as, being, the, result, of, the, ease, by, which, primary, commodities, may, be, extorted, or, captured, compared, to, other, forms, of, wealth, for, example, it, is, easy, to, capture, and, control, the, output, of, a, gold, mine, or, oil, field, compared, to, a, sector, of, garment, manufacturing, or, hospitality, services, a, second, source, of, finance, is, national, diasporas, which, can, fund, rebellions, and, insurgencies, from, abroad, the, study, found, that, statistically, switching, the, size, of, a, country, s, diaspora, from, the, smallest, found, in, the, study, to, the, largest, resulted, in, a, sixfold, increase, in, the, chance, of, a, civil, war, higher, male, secondary, school, enrollment, per, capita, income, and, economic, growth, rate, all, had, significant, effects, on, reducing, the, chance, of, civil, war, specifically, a, male, secondary, school, enrollment, 10, above, the, average, reduced, the, chance, of, a, conflict, by, about, 3, while, a, growth, rate, 1, higher, than, the, study, average, resulted, in, a, decline, in, the, chance, of, a, civil, war, of, about, 1, the, study, interpreted, these, three, factors, as, proxies, for, earnings, forgone, by, rebellion, and, therefore, that, lower, forgone, earnings, encourage, rebellion, phrased, another, way, young, males, who, make, up, the, vast, majority, of, combatants, in, civil, wars, are, less, likely, to, join, a, rebellion, if, they, are, getting, an, education, or, have, a, comfortable, salary, and, can, reasonably, assume, that, they, will, prosper, in, the, future, low, per, capita, income, has, also, been, proposed, as, a, cause, for, grievance, prompting, armed, rebellion, however, for, this, to, be, true, one, would, expect, economic, inequality, to, also, be, a, significant, factor, in, rebellions, which, it, is, not, the, study, therefore, concluded, that, the, economic, model, of, opportunity, cost, better, explained, the, findings, most, proxies, for, grievance, the, theory, that, civil, wars, begin, because, of, issues, of, identity, rather, than, economics, were, statistically, insignificant, including, economic, equality, political, rights, ethnic, polarization, and, religious, fractionalization, only, ethnic, dominance, the, case, where, the, largest, ethnic, group, comprises, a, majority, of, the, population, increased, the, risk, of, civil, war, a, country, characterized, by, ethnic, dominance, has, nearly, twice, the, chance, of, a, civil, war, however, the, combined, effects, of, ethnic, and, religious, fractionalization, i, e, the, greater, chance, that, any, two, randomly, chosen, people, will, be, from, separate, ethnic, or, religious, groups, the, less, chance, of, a, civil, war, were, also, significant, and, positive, as, long, as, the, country, avoided, ethnic, dominance, the, study, interpreted, this, as, stating, that, minority, groups, are, more, likely, to, rebel, if, they, feel, that, they, are, being, dominated, but, that, rebellions, are, more, likely, to, occur, the, more, homogeneous, the, population, and, thus, more, cohesive, the, rebels, these, two, factors, may, thus, be, seen, as, mitigating, each, other, in, many, cases, david, keen, a, professor, at, the, development, studies, institute, at, the, london, school, of, economics, is, one, of, the, major, critics, of, greed, vs, grievance, theory, defined, primarily, by, paul, collier, and, argues, the, point, that, a, conflict, although, he, cannot, define, it, cannot, be, pinpointed, to, simply, one, motive, he, believes, that, conflicts, are, much, more, complex, and, thus, should, not, be, analyzed, through, simplified, methods, he, disagrees, with, the, quantitative, research, methods, of, collier, and, believes, a, stronger, emphasis, should, be, put, on, personal, data, and, human, perspective, of, the, people, in, conflict, beyond, keen, several, other, authors, have, introduced, works, that, either, disprove, greed, vs, grievance, theory, with, empirical, data, or, dismiss, its, ultimate, conclusion, authors, such, as, cristina, bodea, and, ibrahim, elbadawi, who, co, wrote, the, entry, riots, coups, and, civil, war, revisiting, the, greed, and, grievance, debate, argue, that, empirical, data, can, disprove, many, of, the, proponents, of, greed, theory, and, make, the, idea, irrelevant, they, examine, a, myriad, of, factors, and, conclude, that, too, many, factors, come, into, play, with, conflict, which, cannot, be, confined, to, simply, greed, or, grievance, anthony, vinci, makes, a, strong, argument, that, fungible, concept, of, power, and, the, primary, motivation, of, survival, provide, superior, explanations, of, armed, group, motivation, and, more, broadly, the, conduct, of, internal, conflicts, james, fearon, and, david, laitin, find, that, ethnic, and, religious, diversity, does, not, make, civil, war, more, likely, they, instead, find, that, factors, that, make, it, easier, for, rebels, to, recruit, foot, soldiers, and, sustain, insurgencies, such, as, poverty, which, marks, financially, bureaucratically, weak, states, and, also, favors, rebel, recruitment, political, instability, rough, terrain, and, large, populations, make, civil, wars, more, likely, such, research, finds, that, civil, wars, happen, because, the, state, is, weak, both, authoritarian, and, democratic, states, can, be, stable, if, they, have, the, financial, and, military, capacity, to, put, down, rebellions, some, scholars, such, as, lars, erik, cederman, of, the, center, for, security, studies, css, at, the, swiss, federal, institute, of, technology, have, criticized, the, data, used, by, fearon, and, laitin, to, determine, ethnic, and, religious, diversity, in, his, 2007, paper, beyond, fractionalization, mapping, ethnicity, onto, nationalist, insurgencies, cederman, argues, that, the, ethno, linguistic, fractionalization, index, elf, used, by, fearon, laitin, and, other, political, scientists, is, flawed, elf, cederman, states, measures, diversity, on, a, country, s, population, wide, level, and, makes, no, attempt, to, determine, the, number, of, ethnic, groups, in, relation, to, what, role, they, play, in, the, power, of, the, state, and, its, military, cederman, believes, it, makes, little, sense, to, test, hypotheses, relating, national, ethnic, diversity, to, civil, war, outbreak, without, any, explicit, reference, to, how, many, different, ethnic, groups, actually, hold, power, in, the, state, this, suggests, that, ethnic, linguistic, and, religious, cleavages, can, matter, depending, on, the, extent, to, which, the, various, groups, have, ability, and, influence, to, mobilize, on, either, side, of, a, forming, conflict, themes, explored, in, cederman, s, later, work, criticizing, the, use, of, ethnic, fractionalization, measures, as, input, variables, to, predict, civil, war, outbreak, relate, to, these, indices, not, accounting, for, the, geographical, distribution, of, ethnic, groups, within, countries, as, this, can, affect, their, access, to, regional, resources, and, commodities, which, in, turn, can, lead, to, conflict, a, third, theme, explored, by, cederman, is, that, ethnolinguistic, fractionalization, does, not, quantify, the, extent, to, which, there, is, pre, existing, economic, inequality, between, ethnic, groups, within, countries, in, a, 2011, article, cederman, and, fellow, researchers, describe, finding, that, in, highly, unequal, societies, both, rich, and, poor, groups, fight, more, often, than, those, groups, whose, wealth, lies, closer, to, the, country, average, going, against, the, opportunity, based, explanation, for, civil, war, outbreak, michael, bleaney, professor, of, international, economics, at, the, university, of, nottingham, published, a, 2009, paper, titled, incidence, onset, and, duration, of, civil, wars, a, review, of, the, evidence, which, tested, numerous, variables, for, their, relationship, to, civil, war, outbreak, with, different, datasets, including, that, utilized, by, fearon, and, laitin, bleaney, concluded, that, neither, ethnoreligious, diversity, as, measured, by, fractionalization, nor, another, variable, ethnic, polarization, defined, as, the, extent, to, which, individuals, in, a, population, are, distributed, across, different, ethnic, groups, were, a, sufficient, measure, of, diversity, as, it, affects, the, probability, of, conflict, in, a, state, torn, by, civil, war, the, contesting, powers, often, do, not, have, the, ability, to, commit, or, the, trust, to, believe, in, the, other, side, s, commitment, to, put, an, end, to, war, when, considering, a, peace, agreement, the, involved, parties, are, aware, of, the, high, incentives, to, withdraw, once, one, of, them, has, taken, an, action, that, weakens, their, military, political, or, economical, power, commitment, problems, may, deter, a, lasting, peace, agreement, as, the, powers, in, question, are, aware, that, neither, of, them, is, able, to, commit, to, their, end, of, the, bargain, in, the, future, states, are, often, unable, to, escape, conflict, traps, recurring, civil, war, conflicts, due, to, the, lack, of, strong, political, and, legal, institutions, that, motivate, bargaining, settle, disputes, and, enforce, peace, settlements, political, scientist, barbara, f, walter, suggests, that, most, contemporary, civil, wars, are, actually, repeats, of, earlier, civil, wars, that, often, arise, when, leaders, are, not, accountable, to, the, public, when, there, is, poor, public, participation, in, politics, and, when, there, is, a, lack, of, transparency, of, information, between, the, executives, and, the, public, walter, argues, that, when, these, issues, are, properly, reversed, they, act, as, political, and, legal, restraints, on, executive, power, forcing, the, established, government, to, better, serve, the, people, additionally, these, political, and, legal, restraints, create, a, standardized, avenue, to, influence, government, and, increase, the, commitment, credibility, of, established, peace, treaties, it, is, the, strength, of, a, nation, s, institutionalization, and, good, governance, not, the, presence, of, democracy, nor, the, poverty, level, that, is, the, number, one, indicator, of, the, chance, of, a, repeat, civil, war, according, to, walter, high, levels, of, population, dispersion, and, to, a, lesser, extent, the, presence, of, mountainous, terrain, increased, the, chance, of, conflict, both, of, these, factors, favor, rebels, as, a, population, dispersed, outward, toward, the, borders, is, harder, to, control, than, one, concentrated, in, a, central, region, while, mountains, offer, terrain, where, rebels, can, seek, sanctuary, rough, terrain, was, highlighted, as, one, of, the, more, important, factors, in, a, 2006, systematic, review, the, various, factors, contributing, to, the, risk, of, civil, war, rise, increase, with, population, size, the, risk, of, a, civil, war, rises, approximately, proportionately, with, the, size, of, a, country, s, population, there, is, a, correlation, between, poverty, and, civil, war, but, the, causality, which, causes, the, other, is, unclear, some, studies, have, found, that, in, regions, with, lower, income, per, capita, the, likelihood, of, civil, war, is, greater, economists, simeon, djankov, and, marta, reynal, querol, argue, that, the, correlation, is, spurious, and, that, lower, income, and, heightened, conflict, are, instead, products, of, other, phenomena, in, contrast, a, study, by, alex, braithwaite, and, colleagues, showed, systematic, evidence, of, a, causal, arrow, running, from, poverty, to, conflict, while, there, is, a, supposed, negative, correlation, between, absolute, welfare, levels, and, the, probability, of, civil, war, outbreak, relative, deprivation, may, actually, be, a, more, pertinent, possible, cause, historically, higher, inequality, levels, led, to, higher, civil, war, probability, since, colonial, rule, or, population, size, are, known, to, increase, civil, war, risk, also, one, may, conclude, that, the, discontent, of, the, colonized, caused, by, the, creation, of, borders, across, tribal, lines, and, bad, treatment, by, the, colonizers, is, one, important, cause, of, civil, conflicts, the, more, time, that, has, elapsed, since, the, last, civil, war, the, less, likely, it, is, that, a, conflict, will, recur, the, study, had, two, possible, explanations, for, this, one, opportunity, based, and, the, other, grievance, based, the, elapsed, time, may, represent, the, depreciation, of, whatever, capital, the, rebellion, was, fought, over, and, thus, increase, the, opportunity, cost, of, restarting, the, conflict, alternatively, elapsed, time, may, represent, the, gradual, process, of, healing, of, old, hatreds, the, study, found, that, the, presence, of, a, diaspora, substantially, reduced, the, positive, effect, of, time, as, the, funding, from, diasporas, offsets, the, depreciation, of, rebellion, specific, capital, evolutionary, psychologist, satoshi, kanazawa, has, argued, that, an, important, cause, of, intergroup, conflict, may, be, the, relative, availability, of, women, of, reproductive, age, he, found, that, polygyny, greatly, increased, the, frequency, of, civil, wars, but, not, interstate, wars, gleditsch, et, al, did, not, find, a, relationship, between, ethnic, groups, with, polygyny, and, increased, frequency, of, civil, wars, but, nations, having, legal, polygamy, may, have, more, civil, wars, they, argued, that, misogyny, is, a, better, explanation, than, polygyny, they, found, that, increased, women, s, rights, were, associated, with, fewer, civil, wars, and, that, legal, polygamy, had, no, effect, after, women, s, rights, were, controlled, for, political, scholar, elisabeth, wood, from, yale, university, offers, yet, another, rationale, for, why, civilians, rebel, and, or, support, civil, war, through, her, studies, of, the, salvadoran, civil, war, wood, finds, that, traditional, explanations, of, greed, and, grievance, are, not, sufficient, to, explain, the, emergence, of, that, insurgent, movement, instead, she, argues, that, emotional, engagements, and, moral, commitments, are, the, main, reasons, why, thousand, of, civilians, most, of, them, from, poor, and, rural, backgrounds, joined, or, supported, the, farabundo, mart, national, liberation, front, despite, individually, facing, both, high, risks, and, virtually, no, foreseeable, gains, wood, also, attributes, participation, in, the, civil, war, to, the, value, that, insurgents, assigned, to, changing, social, relations, in, el, salvador, an, experience, she, defines, as, the, pleasure, of, agency, ann, hironaka, author, of, neverending, wars, divides, the, modern, history, of, civil, wars, into, the, pre, 19th, century, 19th, century, to, early, 20th, century, and, late, 20th, century, in, 19th, century, europe, the, length, of, civil, wars, fell, significantly, largely, due, to, the, nature, of, the, conflicts, as, battles, for, the, power, center, of, the, state, the, strength, of, centralized, governments, and, the, normally, quick, and, decisive, intervention, by, other, states, to, support, the, government, following, world, war, ii, the, duration, of, civil, wars, grew, past, the, norm, of, the, pre, 19th, century, largely, due, to, weakness, of, the, many, postcolonial, states, and, the, intervention, by, major, powers, on, both, sides, of, conflict, the, most, obvious, commonality, to, civil, wars, are, that, they, occur, in, fragile, states, civil, wars, in, the, 19th, century, and, in, the, early, 20th, century, tended, to, be, short, civil, wars, between, 1900, and, 1944, lasted, on, average, one, and, a, half, years, the, state, itself, formed, the, obvious, center, of, authority, in, the, majority, of, cases, and, the, civil, wars, were, thus, fought, for, control, of, the, state, this, meant, that, whoever, had, control, of, the, capital, and, the, military, could, normally, crush, resistance, a, rebellion, which, failed, to, quickly, seize, the, capital, and, control, of, the, military, for, itself, normally, found, itself, doomed, to, rapid, destruction, for, example, the, fighting, associated, with, the, 1871, paris, commune, occurred, almost, entirely, in, paris, and, ended, quickly, once, the, military, sided, with, the, government, at, versailles, and, conquered, paris, the, power, of, non, state, actors, resulted, in, a, lower, value, placed, on, sovereignty, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, which, further, reduced, the, number, of, civil, wars, for, example, the, pirates, of, the, barbary, coast, were, recognized, as, de, facto, states, because, of, their, military, power, the, barbary, pirates, thus, had, no, need, to, rebel, against, the, ottoman, empire, their, nominal, state, government, to, gain, recognition, of, their, sovereignty, conversely, states, such, as, virginia, and, massachusetts, in, the, united, states, of, america, did, not, have, sovereign, status, but, had, significant, political, and, economic, independence, coupled, with, weak, federal, control, reducing, the, incentive, to, secede, the, two, major, global, ideologies, monarchism, and, democracy, led, to, several, civil, wars, however, a, bi, polar, world, divided, between, the, two, ideologies, did, not, develop, largely, due, to, the, dominance, of, monarchists, through, most, of, the, period, the, monarchists, would, thus, normally, intervene, in, other, countries, to, stop, democratic, movements, taking, control, and, forming, democratic, governments, which, were, seen, by, monarchists, as, being, both, dangerous, and, unpredictable, the, great, powers, defined, in, the, 1815, congress, of, vienna, as, the, united, kingdom, habsburg, austria, prussia, france, and, russia, would, frequently, coordinate, interventions, in, other, nations, civil, wars, nearly, always, on, the, side, of, the, incumbent, government, given, the, military, strength, of, the, great, powers, these, interventions, nearly, always, proved, decisive, and, quickly, ended, the, civil, wars, there, were, several, exceptions, from, the, general, rule, of, quick, civil, wars, during, this, period, the, american, civil, war, 1861, 1865, was, unusual, for, at, least, two, reasons, it, was, fought, around, regional, identities, as, well, as, political, ideologies, and, it, ended, through, a, war, of, attrition, rather, than, with, a, decisive, battle, over, control, of, the, capital, as, was, the, norm, the, spanish, civil, war, 1936, 1939, proved, exceptional, because, both, sides, in, the, struggle, received, support, from, intervening, great, powers, germany, italy, and, portugal, supported, opposition, leader, francisco, franco, while, france, and, the, soviet, union, supported, the, government, see, proxy, war, in, the, 1990s, about, twenty, civil, wars, were, occurring, concurrently, during, an, average, year, a, rate, about, ten, times, the, historical, average, since, the, 19th, century, however, the, rate, of, new, civil, wars, had, not, increased, appreciably, the, drastic, rise, in, the, number, of, ongoing, wars, after, world, war, ii, was, a, result, of, the, tripling, of, the, average, duration, of, civil, wars, to, over, four, years, this, increase, was, a, result, of, the, increased, number, of, states, the, fragility, of, states, formed, after, 1945, the, decline, in, interstate, war, and, the, cold, war, rivalry, following, world, war, ii, the, major, european, powers, divested, themselves, of, their, colonies, at, an, increasing, rate, the, number, of, ex, colonial, states, jumped, from, about, 30, to, almost, 120, after, the, war, the, rate, of, state, formation, leveled, off, in, the, 1980s, at, which, point, few, colonies, remained, more, states, also, meant, more, states, in, which, to, have, long, civil, wars, hironaka, statistically, measures, the, impact, of, the, increased, number, of, ex, colonial, states, as, increasing, the, post, world, war, ii, incidence, of, civil, wars, by, 165, over, the, pre, 1945, number, while, the, new, ex, colonial, states, appeared, to, follow, the, blueprint, of, the, idealized, state, centralized, government, territory, enclosed, by, defined, borders, and, citizenry, with, defined, rights, as, well, as, accessories, such, as, a, national, flag, an, anthem, a, seat, at, the, united, nations, and, an, official, economic, policy, they, were, in, actuality, far, weaker, than, the, western, states, they, were, modeled, after, in, western, states, the, structure, of, governments, closely, matched, states, actual, capabilities, which, had, been, arduously, developed, over, centuries, the, development, of, strong, administrative, structures, in, particular, those, related, to, extraction, of, taxes, is, closely, associated, with, the, intense, warfare, between, predatory, european, states, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, or, in, charles, tilly, s, famous, formulation, war, made, the, state, and, the, state, made, war, for, example, the, formation, of, the, modern, states, of, germany, and, italy, in, the, 19th, century, is, closely, associated, with, the, wars, of, expansion, and, consolidation, led, by, prussia, and, sardinia, piedmont, respectively, the, western, process, of, forming, effective, and, impersonal, bureaucracies, developing, efficient, tax, systems, and, integrating, national, territory, continued, into, the, 20th, century, nevertheless, western, states, that, survived, into, the, latter, half, of, the, 20th, century, were, considered, strong, by, simple, reason, that, they, had, managed, to, develop, the, institutional, structures, and, military, capability, required, to, survive, predation, by, their, fellow, states, in, sharp, contrast, decolonization, was, an, entirely, different, process, of, state, formation, most, imperial, powers, had, not, foreseen, a, need, to, prepare, their, colonies, for, independence, for, example, britain, had, given, limited, self, rule, to, india, and, sri, lanka, while, treating, british, somaliland, as, little, more, than, a, trading, post, while, all, major, decisions, for, french, colonies, were, made, in, paris, and, belgium, prohibited, any, self, government, up, until, it, suddenly, granted, independence, to, its, colonies, in, 1960, like, western, states, of, previous, centuries, the, new, ex, colonies, lacked, autonomous, bureaucracies, which, would, make, decisions, based, on, the, benefit, to, society, as, a, whole, rather, than, respond, to, corruption, and, nepotism, to, favor, a, particular, interest, group, in, such, a, situation, factions, manipulate, the, state, to, benefit, themselves, or, alternatively, state, leaders, use, the, bureaucracy, to, further, their, own, self, interest, the, lack, of, credible, governance, was, compounded, by, the, fact, that, most, colonies, were, economic, loss, makers, at, independence, lacking, both, a, productive, economic, base, and, a, taxation, system, to, effectively, extract, resources, from, economic, activity, among, the, rare, states, profitable, at, decolonization, was, india, to, which, scholars, credibly, argue, that, uganda, malaysia, and, angola, may, be, included, neither, did, imperial, powers, make, territorial, integration, a, priority, and, may, have, discouraged, nascent, nationalism, as, a, danger, to, their, rule, many, newly, independent, states, thus, found, themselves, impoverished, with, minimal, administrative, capacity, in, a, fragmented, society, while, faced, with, the, expectation, of, immediately, meeting, the, demands, of, a, modern, state, such, states, are, considered, weak, or, fragile, the, strong, weak, categorization, is, not, the, same, as, western, non, western, as, some, latin, american, states, like, argentina, and, brazil, and, middle, eastern, states, like, egypt, and, israel, are, considered, to, have, strong, administrative, structures, and, economic, infrastructure, historically, the, international, community, would, have, targeted, weak, states, for, territorial, absorption, or, colonial, domination, or, alternatively, such, states, would, fragment, into, pieces, small, enough, to, be, effectively, administered, and, secured, by, a, local, power, however, international, norms, towards, sovereignty, changed, in, the, wake, of, world, war, ii, in, ways, that, support, and, maintain, the, existence, of, weak, states, weak, states, are, given, de, jure, sovereignty, equal, to, that, of, other, states, even, when, they, do, not, have, de, facto, sovereignty, or, control, of, their, own, territory, including, the, privileges, of, international, diplomatic, recognition, and, an, equal, vote, in, the, united, nations, further, the, international, community, offers, development, aid, to, weak, states, which, helps, maintain, the, facade, of, a, functioning, modern, state, by, giving, the, appearance, that, the, state, is, capable, of, fulfilling, its, implied, responsibilities, of, control, and, order, the, formation, of, a, strong, international, law, regime, and, norms, against, territorial, aggression, is, strongly, associated, with, the, dramatic, drop, in, the, number, of, interstate, wars, though, it, has, also, been, attributed, to, the, effect, of, the, cold, war, or, to, the, changing, nature, of, economic, development, consequently, military, aggression, that, results, in, territorial, annexation, became, increasingly, likely, to, prompt, international, condemnation, diplomatic, censure, a, reduction, in, international, aid, or, the, introduction, of, economic, sanction, or, as, in, the, case, of, 1990, invasion, of, kuwait, by, iraq, international, military, intervention, to, reverse, the, territorial, aggression, similarly, the, international, community, has, largely, refused, to, recognize, secessionist, regions, while, keeping, some, secessionist, self, declared, states, such, as, somaliland, in, diplomatic, recognition, limbo, while, there, is, not, a, large, body, of, academic, work, examining, the, relationship, hironaka, s, statistical, study, found, a, correlation, that, suggests, that, every, major, international, anti, secessionist, declaration, increased, the, number, of, ongoing, civil, wars, by, 10, or, a, total, 114, from, 1945, to, 1997, the, diplomatic, and, legal, protection, given, by, the, international, community, as, well, as, economic, support, to, weak, governments, and, discouragement, of, secession, thus, had, the, unintended, effect, of, encouraging, civil, wars, there, has, been, an, enormous, amount, of, international, intervention, in, civil, wars, since, 1945, that, some, have, argued, served, to, extend, wars, according, to, patrick, m, regan, in, his, book, civil, wars, and, foreign, powers, 2000, about, 2, 3rds, of, the, 138, intrastate, conflicts, between, the, end, of, world, war, ii, and, 2000, saw, international, intervention, with, the, united, states, intervening, in, 35, of, these, conflicts, while, intervention, has, been, practiced, since, the, international, system, has, existed, its, nature, changed, substantially, it, became, common, for, both, the, state, and, opposition, group, to, receive, foreign, support, allowing, wars, to, continue, well, past, the, point, when, domestic, resources, had, been, exhausted, superpowers, such, as, the, european, great, powers, had, always, felt, no, compunction, in, intervening, in, civil, wars, that, affected, their, interests, while, distant, regional, powers, such, as, the, united, states, could, declare, the, interventionist, monroe, doctrine, of, 1821, for, events, in, its, central, american, backyard, however, the, large, population, of, weak, states, after, 1945, allowed, intervention, by, former, colonial, powers, regional, powers, and, neighboring, states, who, themselves, often, had, scarce, resources, the, effectiveness, of, intervention, is, widely, debated, in, part, because, the, data, suffers, from, selection, bias, as, fortna, has, argued, peacekeepers, select, themselves, into, difficult, cases, when, controlling, for, this, effect, forta, holds, that, peacekeeping, is, resoundingly, successful, in, shortening, wars, however, other, scholars, disagree, knaus, and, stewart, are, extremely, skeptical, as, to, the, effectiveness, of, interventions, holding, that, they, can, only, work, when, they, are, performed, with, extreme, caution, and, sensitivity, to, context, a, strategy, they, label, principled, incrementalism, few, interventions, for, them, have, demonstrated, such, an, approach, other, scholars, offer, more, specific, criticisms, dube, and, naidu, for, instance, show, that, us, military, aid, a, less, conventional, form, of, intervention, seems, to, be, siphoned, off, to, paramilitaries, thus, exacerbating, violence, weinstein, holds, more, generally, that, interventions, might, disrupt, processes, of, autonomous, recovery, whereby, civil, war, contributes, to, state, building, on, average, a, civil, war, with, interstate, intervention, was, 300, longer, than, those, without, when, disaggregated, a, civil, war, with, intervention, on, only, one, side, is, 156, longer, while, when, intervention, occurs, on, both, sides, the, average, civil, war, is, longer, by, an, additional, 92, if, one, of, the, intervening, states, was, a, superpower, a, civil, war, is, a, further, 72, longer, a, conflict, such, as, the, angolan, civil, war, in, which, there, is, two, sided, foreign, intervention, including, by, a, superpower, actually, two, superpowers, in, the, case, of, angola, would, be, 538, longer, on, average, than, a, civil, war, without, any, international, intervention, the, cold, war, 1947, 1991, provided, a, global, network, of, material, and, ideological, support, that, often, helped, perpetuate, civil, wars, which, were, mainly, fought, in, weak, ex, colonial, states, rather, than, the, relatively, strong, states, that, were, aligned, with, the, warsaw, pact, and, north, atlantic, treaty, organization, in, some, cases, superpowers, would, superimpose, cold, war, ideology, onto, local, conflicts, while, in, others, local, actors, using, cold, war, ideology, would, attract, the, attention, of, a, superpower, to, obtain, support, a, notable, example, is, the, greek, civil, war, 1946, 1949, which, erupted, shortly, after, the, end, of, world, war, ii, this, conflict, saw, the, communist, dominated, democratic, army, of, greece, supported, by, yugoslavia, and, the, soviet, union, opposing, the, kingdom, of, greece, which, was, backed, by, the, united, kingdom, and, the, united, states, under, the, truman, doctrine, and, the, marshall, plan, using, a, separate, statistical, evaluation, than, used, above, for, interventions, civil, wars, that, included, pro, or, anti, communist, forces, lasted, 141, longer, than, the, average, non, cold, war, conflict, while, a, cold, war, civil, war, that, attracted, superpower, intervention, resulted, in, wars, typically, lasting, over, three, times, as, long, as, other, civil, wars, conversely, the, end, of, the, cold, war, marked, by, the, fall, of, the, berlin, wall, in, 1989, resulted, in, a, reduction, in, the, duration, of, cold, war, civil, wars, of, 92, or, phrased, another, way, a, roughly, ten, fold, increase, in, the, rate, of, resolution, of, cold, war, civil, wars, lengthy, cold, war, associated, civil, conflicts, that, ground, to, a, halt, include, the, wars, of, guatemala, 1960, 1996, el, salvador, 1979, 1991, and, nicaragua, 1970, 1990, according, to, barbara, f, walter, post, 2003, civil, wars, are, different, from, previous, civil, wars, in, that, most, are, situated, in, muslim, majority, countries, most, of, the, rebel, groups, espouse, radical, islamist, ideas, and, goals, and, most, of, these, radical, groups, pursue, transnational, rather, than, national, aims, she, attributes, this, shift, to, changes, in, information, technology, especially, the, advent, of, the, web, 2, 0, in, the, early, 2000s, civil, wars, often, have, severe, economic, consequences, two, studies, estimate, that, each, year, of, civil, war, reduces, a, country, s, gdp, growth, by, about, 2, it, also, has, a, regional, effect, reducing, the, gdp, growth, of, neighboring, countries, civil, wars, also, have, the, potential, to, lock, the, country, in, a, conflict, trap, where, each, conflict, increases, the, likelihood, of, future, conflict
