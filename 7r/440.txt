and, of, the, military, since, the, late, 12th, century, the, amhara, nobles, supported, the, zagwe, prince, lalibela, in, his, power, struggle, against, his, brothers, which, led, him, to, make,

regions, like, oromo, somali, afar, and, tigrinya, amharic, is, an, afro, asiatic, language, of, the, southwest, semitic, group, and, is, related, to, ge, ez, or, ethiopic, the, liturgical, language, of, the, ethiopian, orthodox, church, amharic, is, written, in, a, slightly, modified, form, of, the, alphabet, used, for, writing, the, ge, ez, language, there, are, 34, basic, characters, each, of, which, has, seven, forms, depending, on, which, vowel, is, to, be, pronounced, in, the, syllable, there, are, also, 49, wa, letters, which, form, compound, sounds, involving, w, all, together, the, alphabet, has, some, 280, letters, until, 2020, amharic, was, the, sole, official, language, of, ethiopia, the, 2007, census, reported, that, amharic, was, spoken, by, 21, 6, million, native, speakers, in, ethiopia, more, recent, sources, state, the, number, of, first, language, speakers, in, 2018, as, nearly, 32, million, with, another, 25, million, second, language, speakers, in, ethiopia, additionally, 3, million, emigrants, outside, of, ethiopia, speak, the, language, most, of, the, ethiopian, jewish, communities, in, ethiopia, and, israel, speak, amharic, furthermore, amharic, is, considered, a, holy, language, by, the, rastafari, religion, and, is, widely, used, among, its, followers, worldwide, early, afro, asiatic, populations, speaking, proto, semitic, proto, cushitic, and, proto, omotic, languages, would, have, diverged, by, the, fourth, or, fifth, millennium, bc, shortly, afterwards, the, proto, cushitic, and, proto, omotic, groups, would, have, settled, in, the, ethiopian, highlands, with, the, proto, semitic, speakers, crossing, the, sinai, peninsula, into, asia, a, later, return, movement, of, peoples, from, south, arabia, would, have, introduced, the, semitic, languages, to, ethiopia, based, on, archaeological, evidence, the, presence, of, semitic, speakers, in, the, territory, date, to, some, time, before, 500, bc, linguistic, analysis, suggests, the, presence, of, semitic, languages, in, ethiopia, as, early, as, 2000, bc, levine, indicates, that, by, the, end, of, that, millennium, the, core, inhabitants, of, greater, ethiopia, would, have, consisted, of, dark, skinned, agropastoralists, speaking, afro, asiatic, languages, of, the, semitic, cushitic, and, omotic, branches, other, scholars, such, as, messay, kebede, and, daniel, e, alemu, argue, that, migration, across, the, red, sea, was, defined, by, reciprocal, exchange, if, it, even, occurred, at, all, and, that, ethio, semitic, speaking, ethnic, groups, should, not, be, characterized, as, foreign, invaders, amharic, is, a, south, ethio, semitic, language, along, with, gurage, argobba, harari, and, others, due, to, the, social, stratification, of, the, time, the, cushitic, agaw, adopted, the, south, ethio, semitic, language, and, eventually, absorbed, the, semitic, population, amharic, thus, developed, with, a, cushitic, substratum, and, a, semitic, superstratum, the, northernmost, south, ethio, semitic, speakers, or, the, proto, amhara, remained, in, constant, contact, with, their, north, ethio, semitic, neighbors, evidenced, by, linguistic, analysis, and, oral, traditions, a, 7th, century, southward, shift, of, the, center, of, gravity, of, the, kingdom, of, aksum, and, the, ensuing, integration, and, christianization, of, the, proto, amhara, also, resulted, in, a, high, prevalence, of, ge, ez, sourced, lexicon, in, amharic, some, time, after, the, 9th, century, ad, amharic, diverged, from, its, closest, relative, argobba, probably, due, to, religious, differences, as, the, argobba, adopted, islam, in, 1983, lionel, bender, proposed, that, amharic, may, have, been, constructed, as, a, pidgin, as, early, as, the, 4th, century, ad, to, enable, communication, between, aksumite, soldiers, speaking, semitic, cushitic, and, omotic, languages, but, this, hypothesis, has, not, garnered, widespread, acceptance, the, preservation, in, old, amharic, of, vso, word, order, and, gutturals, typical, of, semitic, languages, cushitic, influences, shared, with, other, ethio, semitic, languages, especially, those, of, the, southern, branch, and, the, number, of, geographically, distinct, cushitic, languages, that, have, influenced, amharic, at, different, points, in, time, e, g, oromo, influence, beginning, in, the, 16th, century, support, a, natural, evolution, of, amharic, from, a, proto, ethio, semitic, language, with, considerable, cushitic, influences, similar, to, gurage, tigrinya, etc, the, amharic, ejective, consonants, correspond, to, the, proto, semitic, emphatic, consonants, in, the, ethiopianist, tradition, they, are, often, transcribed, with, a, dot, below, the, letter, the, notation, of, central, vowels, in, the, ethiopianist, tradition, is, shown, in, angled, brackets, the, voiced, bilabial, plosive, b, is, phonetically, realized, as, a, voiced, labial, approximant, medially, between, sonorants, in, non, geminated, form, the, fricative, ejective, s, is, heard, as, a, fricative, ejective, but, is, mostly, heard, as, the, affricate, sound, the, rhotic, consonant, is, realized, as, a, trill, when, geminated, and, a, tap, otherwise, the, closed, central, unrounded, vowel, and, mid, central, vowel, are, generally, fronted, to, and, respectively, following, palatal, consonants, and, generally, retracted, and, rounded, to, and, respectively, following, labialized, velar, consonants, the, amharic, script, is, an, abugida, and, the, graphemes, of, the, amharic, writing, system, are, called, fid, l, it, is, derived, from, a, modification, of, the, ge, ez, script, each, character, represents, a, consonant, vowel, sequence, but, the, basic, shape, of, each, character, is, determined, by, the, consonant, which, is, modified, for, the, vowel, some, consonant, phonemes, are, written, by, more, than, one, series, of, characters, s, ts, and, h, the, last, one, has, four, distinct, letter, forms, this, is, because, these, fid, l, originally, represented, distinct, sounds, but, phonological, changes, merged, them, the, citation, form, for, each, series, is, the, consonant, form, i, e, the, first, column, of, the, fid, l, the, amharic, script, is, included, in, unicode, and, glyphs, are, included, in, fonts, available, with, major, operating, systems, as, in, most, other, ethiopian, semitic, languages, gemination, is, contrastive, in, amharic, that, is, consonant, length, can, distinguish, words, from, one, another, for, example, al, he, said, all, there, is, y, m, tall, he, hits, y, mm, ttall, he, will, be, hit, gemination, is, not, indicated, in, amharic, orthography, but, amharic, readers, typically, do, not, find, this, to, be, a, problem, this, property, of, the, writing, system, is, analogous, to, the, vowels, of, arabic, and, hebrew, or, the, tones, of, many, bantu, languages, which, are, not, normally, indicated, in, writing, ethiopian, novelist, haddis, alemayehu, who, was, an, advocate, of, amharic, orthography, reform, indicated, gemination, in, his, novel, love, to, the, grave, by, placing, a, dot, above, the, characters, whose, consonants, were, geminated, but, this, practice, is, rare, punctuation, includes, the, following, one, may, construct, simple, amharic, sentences, by, using, a, subject, and, a, predicate, here, are, a, few, simple, sentences, ityop, p, ya, ethiopia, afrika, africa, w, s, in, nat, is, ityop, p, ya, afrika, w, s, nat, ethiopia, africa, in, is, ethiopia, is, in, africa, l, u,

came, to, the, city, amharic, grammar, distinguishes, person, number, and, often, gender, this, includes, personal, pronouns, such, as, english, i, amharic, ne, english, she, amharic, sswa, as, in, other, semitic, languages, the, same, distinctions, appear, in, three, other, places, in, their, grammar, all, amharic, verbs, agree, with, their, subjects, that, is, the, person, number, and, in, the, second, and, third, person, singular, gender, of, the, subject, of, the, verb, are, marked, by, suffixes, or, prefixes, on, the, verb, because, the, affixes, that, signal, subject, agreement, vary, greatly, with, the, particular, verb, tense, aspect, mood, they, are, normally, not, considered, to, be, pronouns, and, are, discussed, elsewhere, in, this, article, under, verb, conjugation, amharic, verbs, often, have, additional, morphology, that, indicates, the, person, number, and, second, and, third, person, singular, gender, of, the, object, of, the, verb, almaz, n, almaz, acc, ayy, h, at, i, saw, her, almaz, n, ayy, h, at, almaz, acc, i, saw, her, i, saw, almaz, while, morphemes, such, as, at, in, this, example, are, sometimes, described, as, signaling, object, agreement, analogous, to, subject, agreement, they, are, more, often, thought, of, as, object, pronoun, suffixes, because, unlike, the, markers, of, subject, agreement, they, do, not, vary, significantly, with, the, tense, aspect, mood, of, the, verb, for, arguments, of, the, verb, other, than, the, subject, or, the, object, there, are, two, separate, sets, of, related, suffixes, one, with, a, benefactive, meaning, to, for, the, other, with, an, adversative, or, locative, meaning, against, to, the, detriment, of, on, at, l, almaz, for, almaz, b, rrun, door, def, acc, k, ff, tku, llat, i, opened, for, her, l, almaz, b, rrun, k, ff, tku, llat, for, almaz, door, def, acc, i, opened, for, her, i, opened, the, door, for, almaz, b, almaz, on, almaz, b, rrun, door, def, acc, z, ggahu, bbat, i, closed, on, her, b, almaz, b, rrun, z, ggahu, bbat, on, almaz, door, def, acc, i, closed, on, her, i, closed, the, door, on, almaz, to, her, detriment, morphemes, such, as, llat, and, bbat, in, these, examples, will, be, referred, to, in, this, article, as, prepositional, object, pronoun, suffixes, because, they, correspond, to, prepositional, phrases, such, as, for, her, and, on, her, to, distinguish, them, from, the, direct, object, pronoun, suffixes, such, as, at, her, amharic, has, a, further, set, of, morphemes, that, are, suffixed, to, nouns, signaling, possession, bet, house, bete, my, house, betwa, her, house, in, each, of, these, four, aspects, of, the, grammar, independent, pronouns, subject, verb, agreement, object, pronoun, suffixes, and, possessive, suffixes, amharic, distinguishes, eight, combinations, of, person, number, and, gender, for, first, person, there, is, a, two, way, distinction, between, singular, i, and, plural, we, whereas, for, second, and, third, persons, there, is, a, distinction, between, singular, and, plural, and, within, the, singular, a, further, distinction, between, masculine, and, feminine, you, m, sg, you, f, sg, you, pl, he, she, they, amharic, is, a, pro, drop, language, neutral, sentences, in, which, no, element, is, emphasized, normally, omit, independent, pronouns, ityop, p, yawi, n, w, he, s, ethiopian, gabb, zkwat, i, invited, her, the, amharic, words, that, translate, he, i, and, her, do, not, appear, in, these, sentences, as, independent, words, however, in, such, cases, the, person, number, and, second, or, third, person, singular, gender, of, the, subject, and, object, are, marked, on, the, verb, when, the, subject, or, object, in, such, sentences, is, emphasized, an, independent, pronoun, is, used, ssu, ityop, p, yawi, n, w, he, s, ethiopian, ne, gabb, zkwat, i, invited, her, sswan, gabb, zkwat, i, invited, her, the, table, below, shows, alternatives, for, many, of, the, forms, the, choice, depends, on, what, precedes, the, form, in, question, usually, whether, this, is, a, vowel, or, a, consonant, for, example, for, the, first, person, singular, possessive, suffix, ag, r, e, my, country, g, la, ye, my, body, within, second, and, third, person, singular, there, are, two, additional, polite, independent, pronouns, for, reference, to, people, to, whom, the, speaker, wishes, to, show, respect, this, usage, is, an, example, of, the, so, called, t, v, distinction, that, is, made, in, many, languages, the, polite, pronouns, in, amharic, are, rswo, you, sg, polite, and, ssa, w, s, he, polite, although, these, forms, are, singular, semantically, they, refer, to, one, person, they, correspond, to, third, person, plural, elsewhere, in, the, grammar, as, is, common, in, other, t, v, systems, for, the, possessive, pronouns, however, the, polite, 2nd, person, has, the, special, suffix, wo, your, sg, pol, for, possessive, pronouns, mine, yours, etc, amharic, adds, the, independent, pronouns, to, the, preposition, y, of, y, ne, mine, yant, yours, m, sg, yan, i, yours, f, sg, y, sswa, hers, etc, for, reflexive, pronouns, myself, yourself, etc, amharic, adds, the, possessive, suffixes, to, the, noun, ras, head, rase, myself, raswa, herself, etc, like, english, amharic, makes, a, two, way, distinction, between, near, this, these, and, far, that, those, demonstrative, expressions, pronouns, adjectives, adverbs, besides, number, amharic, unlike, english, also, distinguishes, between, the, masculine, and, the, feminine, genders, in, the, singular, there, are, also, separate, demonstratives, for, formal, reference, comparable, to, the, formal, personal, pronouns, ih, this, these, formal, and, nniya, that, those, formal, the, singular, pronouns, have, combining, forms, beginning, with, zz, instead, of, y, when, they, follow, a, preposition, s, l, zzih, because, of, this, therefore, nd, zziya, like, that, the, plural, demonstratives, like, the, second, and, third, person, plural, personal, pronouns, are, formed, by, adding, the, plural, prefix, nn, to, the, singular, masculine, forms, amharic, nouns, can, be, primary, or, derived, a, noun, like, g, r, foot, leg, is, primary, and, a, noun, like, gr, a, pedestrian, is, a, derived, noun, amharic, nouns, can, have, a, masculine, or, feminine, gender, there, are, several, ways, to, express, gender, an, example, is, the, old, suffix, t, for, femininity, this, suffix, is, no, longer, productive, and, is, limited, to, certain, patterns, and, some, isolated, nouns, nouns, and, adjectives, ending, in, awi, usually, take, the, suffix, t, to, form, the, feminine, form, e, g, ityop, p, ya, a, wi, ethiopian, m, vs, ityop, p, ya, wi, t, ethiopian, f, s, may, awi, heavenly, m, vs, s, may, awi, t, heavenly, f, this, suffix, also, occurs, in, nouns, and, adjective, based, on, the, pattern, q, t, t, ul, e, g, n, gus, king, vs, n, g, s, t, queen, and, q, ddus, holy, m, vs, q, dd, s, t, holy, f, some, nouns, and, adjectives, take, a, feminine, marker, it, l, child, boy, vs, l, it, girl, b, g, sheep, ram, vs, b, g, it, ewe, mag, lle, senior, elder, m, vs, mag, ll, it, old, woman, o, a, monkey, vs, o, it, monkey, f, some, nouns, have, this, feminine, marker, without, having, a, masculine, opposite, e, g, r, r, it, spider, azur, it, whirlpool, eddy, there, are, however, also, nouns, having, this, it, suffix, that, are, treated, as, masculine, s, raw, it, army, n, gar, it, big, drum, the, feminine, gender, is, not, only, used, to, indicate, biological, gender, but, may, also, be, used, to, express, smallness, e, g, bet, it, u, the, little, house, lit, house, fem, def, the, feminine, marker, can, also, serve, to, express, tenderness, or, sympathy, amharic, has, special, words, that, can, be, used, to, indicate, the, gender, of, people, and, animals, for, people, w, nd, is, used, for, masculinity, and, set, for, femininity, e, g, w, nd, l, boy, set, l, girl, w, nd, hakim, physician, doctor, m, set, hakim, physician, doctor, f, for, animals, the, words, t, bat, awra, or, w, nd, less, usual, can, be, used, to, indicate, masculine, gender, and, an, st, or, set, to, indicate, feminine, gender, examples, t, bat, a, calf, m, awra, doro, cock, rooster, set, doro, hen, the, plural, suffix, o, is, used, to, express, plurality, of, nouns, some, morphophonological, alternations, occur, depending, on, the, final, consonant, or, vowel, for, nouns, ending, in, a, consonant, plain, o, is, used, bet, house, becomes, bet, o, houses, for, nouns, ending, in, a, back, vowel, a, o, u, the, suffix, takes, the, form, o, e, g, w, a, dog, w, a, o, dogs, k, b, ro, drum, k, b, ro, o, drums, nouns, that, end, in, a, front, vowel, pluralize, using, o, or, y, o, e, g, hafi, scholar, hafi, o, or, hafi, y, o, scholars, another, possibility, for, nouns, ending, in, a, vowel, is, to, delete, the, vowel, and, use, plain, o, as, in, w, o, dogs, besides, using, the, normal, external, plural, o, nouns, and, adjectives, can, be, pluralized, by, way, of, reduplicating, one, of, the, radicals, for, example, w, yz, ro, lady, can, take, the, normal, plural, yielding, w, yz, r, o, but, w, yzaz, r, ladies, is, also, found, leslau, 1995, 173, some, kinship, terms, have, two, plural, forms, with, a, slightly, different, meaning, for, example, w, nd, mm, brother, can, be, pluralized, as, w, nd, mm, o, brothers, but, also, as, w, nd, mmam, a, brothers, of, each, other, likewise, h, t, sister, can, be, pluralized, as, h, t, o, sisters, but, also, as, t, mm, am, a, sisters, of, each, other, in, compound, words, the, plural, marker, is, suffixed, to, the, second, noun, bet, kr, stiyan, church, lit, house, of, christian, becomes, bet, kr, stiyan, o, churches, amsalu, aklilu, has, pointed, out, that, amharic, has, inherited, a, large, number, of, old, plural, forms, directly, from, classical, ethiopic, ge, ez, amharic, g, z, leslau, 1995, 172, there, are, basically, two, archaic, pluralising, strategies, called, external, and, internal, plural, the, external, plural, consists, of, adding, the, suffix, an, usually, masculine, or, at, usually, feminine, to, the, singular, form, the, internal, plural, employs, vowel, quality, or, apophony, to, pluralize, words, similar, to, english, man, vs, men, and, goose, vs, geese, sometimes, combinations, of, the, two, systems, are, found, the, archaic, plural, forms, are, sometimes, used, to, form, new, plurals, but, this, is, only, considered, grammatical, in, more, established, cases, if, a, noun, is, definite, or, specified, this, is, expressed, by, a, suffix, the, article, which, is, u, or, w, for, masculine, singular, nouns, and, wa, itwa, or, twa, for, feminine, singular, nouns, for, example, bet, bet, house, bet, u, bet, u, the, house, s, rrat, a, s, rrat, a, maid, s, rrat, a, wa, s, rrat, a, wa, the, maid, in, singular, forms, this, article, distinguishes, between, the, male, and, female, gender, in, plural, forms, this, distinction, is, absent, and, all, definites, are, marked, with, u, e, g, bet, o, u, houses, g, r, d, o, u, maids, as, in, the, plural, morphophonological, alternations, occur, depending, on, the, final, consonant, or, vowel, amharic, has, an, accusative, marker, n, its, use, is, related, to, the, definiteness, of, the, object, thus, amharic, shows, differential, object, marking, in, general, if, the, object, is, definite, possessed, or, a, proper, noun, the, accusative, must, be, used, but, if, the, direct, object, is, not, determined, the, accusative, marker, is, generally, not, used, leslau, 1995, pp, 181, 182, ff, l, u, child, m, def, w, a, w, n, dog, def, acc, abbarr, r, drove, away, 3ms, subj, l, u, w, a, w, n,

nominalizing, consists, of, a, form, of, vowel, agreement, similar, vowels, on, similar, places, inside, the, three, radical, structures, typical, of, semitic, languages, for, example, there, are, also, several, nominalising, suffixes, as, in, other, semitic, languages, amharic, verbs, use, a, combination, of, prefixes, and, suffixes, to, indicate, the, subject, distinguishing, three, persons, two, numbers, and, in, the, second, and, third, persons, singular, two, genders, along, with, the, infinitive, and, the, present, participle, the, gerund, is, one, of, three, non, finite, verb, forms, the, infinitive, is, a, nominalized, verb, the, present, participle, expresses, incomplete, action, and, the, gerund, expresses, completed, action, e, g, ali, m, sa, b, lto, w, d, g, b, ya, hed, ali, having, eaten, lunch, went, to, the, market, there, are, several, usages, of, the, gerund, depending, on, its, morpho, syntactic, features, the, gerund, functions, as, the, head, of, a, subordinate,
