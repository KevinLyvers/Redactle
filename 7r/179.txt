in, education, a, curriculum, k, r, k, j, l, m, pl, curriculums, or, curricula, k, r, k, j, l, is, the, totality, of, student, experiences, that, occur, in, an, educational, process, the, term, often, refers, specifically, to, a, planned, sequence, of, instruction, or, to, a, view, of, the, student, s, experiences, in, terms, of, the, educator, s, or, school, s, instructional, goals, a, curriculum, may, incorporate, the, planned, interaction, of, pupils, with, instructional, content, materials, resources, and, processes, for, evaluating, the, attainment, of, educational, objectives, curricula, are, split, into, several, categories, the, explicit, the, implicit, including, the, hidden, the, excluded, and, the, extracurricular, curricula, may, be, tightly, standardized, or, may, include, a, high, level, of, instructor, or, learner, autonomy, many, countries, have, national, curricula, in, primary, and, secondary, education, such, as, the, united, kingdom, s, national, curriculum, unesco, s, international, bureau, of, education, has, the, primary, mission, of, studying, curricula, and, their, implementation, worldwide, the, word, curriculum, began, as, a, latin, word, which, means, a, race, or, the, course, of, a, race, which, in, turn, derives, from, the, verb, currere, meaning, to, run, to, proceed, the, word, is, from, a, modern, latin, transferred, use, of, classical, latin, curriculum, a, running, course, career, also, a, fast, chariot, racing, car, from, currere, to, run, from, pie, root, kers, to, run, the, first, known, use, in, an, educational, context, is, in, the, professio, regia, a, work, by, university, of, paris, professor, petrus, ramus, published, posthumously, in, 1576, the, term, subsequently, appears, in, university, of, leiden, records, in, 1582, the, word, s, origins, appear, closely, linked, to, the, calvinist, desire, to, bring, greater, order, to, education, by, the, seventeenth, century, the, university, of, glasgow, also, referred, to, its, course, of, study, as, a, curriculum, producing, the, first, known, use, of, the, term, in, english, in, 1633, by, the, nineteenth, century, european, universities, routinely, referred, to, their, curriculum, to, describe, both, the, complete, course, of, study, as, for, a, degree, in, surgery, and, particular, courses, and, their, content, by, 1824, the, word, was, defined, as, a, course, especially, a, fixed, course, of, study, at, a, college, university, or, school, there, is, no, generally, agreed, upon, definition, of, curriculum, there, various, definitions, that, describe, the, term, through, the, readings, of, smith, dewey, and, kelly, four, types, of, curricula, could, be, defined, as, it, may, also, come, in, the, form, of, extracurricular, activities, this, may, include, school, sponsored, programs, which, are, intended, to, supplement, the, academic, aspect, of, the, school, experience, or, community, based, programs, and, activities, examples, of, school, sponsored, extracurricular, programs, include, sports, academic, clubs, and, performing, arts, community, based, programs, and, activities, may, take, place, at, a, school, after, hours, but, are, not, linked, directly, to, the, school, community, based, programs, frequently, expand, on, the, curriculum, that, was, introduced, in, the, classroom, for, instance, students, may, be, introduced, to, environmental, conservation, in, the, classroom, this, knowledge, is, further, developed, through, a, community, based, program, participants, then, act, on, what, they, know, with, a, conservation, project, community, based, extracurricular, activities, may, include, environmental, clubs, 4, h, boy, girl, scouts, and, religious, groups, hancock, dyk, jones, 2012, kerr, defines, curriculum, as, all, the, learning, which, is, planned, and, guided, by, the, school, whether, it, is, carried, on, in, groups, or, individually, inside, or, outside, of, school, braslavsky, states, that, curriculum, is, an, agreement, among, communities, educational, professionals, and, the, state, on, what, learners, should, take, on, during, specific, periods, of, their, lives, furthermore, the, curriculum, defines, why, what, when, where, how, and, with, whom, to, learn, smith, 1996, 2000, says, that, syllabus, will, not, generally, indicate, the, relative, importance, of, its, topics, or, the, order, in, which, they, are, to, be, studied, where, people, still, equate, curriculum, with, a, syllabus, they, are, likely, to, limit, their, planning, to, a, consideration, of, the, content, or, the, body, of, knowledge, that, they, wish, to, transmit, according, to, smith, a, curriculum, can, be, ordered, into, a, procedure, under, some, definitions, curriculum, is, prescriptive, and, is, based, on, a, more, general, syllabus, which, merely, specifies, what, topics, must, be, understood, and, to, what, level, to, achieve, a, particular, grade, or, standard, a, curriculum, may, also, refer, to, a, defined, and, prescribed, course, of, studies, which, students, must, fulfill, in, order, to, pass, a, certain, level, of, education, for, example, an, elementary, school, might, discuss, how, its, curricula, is, designed, to, improve, national, testing, scores, or, help, students, learn, fundamental, skills, an, individual, teacher, might, also, refer, to, his, or, her, curriculum, meaning, all, the, subjects, that, will, be, taught, during, a, school, year, the, courses, are, arranged, in, a, sequence, to, make, learning, a, subject, easier, in, schools, a, curriculum, spans, several, grades, on, the, other, hand, a, high, school, might, refer, to, their, curricula, as, the, courses, required, in, order, to, receive, one, s, diploma, they, might, also, refer, to, it, in, exactly, the, same, way, as, an, elementary, school, and, use, it, to, mean, both, individual, courses, needed, to, pass, as, well, as, the, overall, offering, of, courses, which, help, prepare, a, student, for, life, after, high, school, a, curriculum, can, be, seen, from, different, perspectives, what, societies, envisage, as, important, teaching, and, learning, constitutes, the, intended, curriculum, since, it, is, usually, presented, in, official, documents, it, may, be, also, called, the, written, or, official, curriculum, however, at, a, classroom, level, this, intended, curriculum, may, be, altered, through, a, range, of, complex, classroom, interactions, and, what, is, actually, delivered, can, be, considered, the, implemented, curriculum, what, learners, really, learn, i, e, what, can, be, assessed, and, can, be, demonstrated, as, learning, outcomes, or, competencies, constitutes, the, achieved, or, learned, curriculum, in, addition, curriculum, theory, points, to, a, hidden, curriculum, i, e, the, unintended, development, of, personal, values, and, beliefs, of, learners, teachers, and, communities, the, unexpected, impact, of, a, curriculum, or, the, unforeseen, aspects, of, a, learning, process, those, who, develop, the, intended, curriculum, should, have, all, these, different, dimensions, of, the, curriculum, in, view, while, the, written, curriculum, does, not, exhaust, the, meaning, of, curriculum, it, is, important, because, it, represents, the, vision, of, the, society, the, written, curriculum, is, usually, expressed, in, comprehensive, and, user, friendly, documents, such, as, curriculum, frameworks, or, subject, curricula, syllabi, and, in, relevant, and, helpful, learning, materials, such, as, textbooks, teacher, guides, and, assessment, guides, in, some, cases, people, see, the, curriculum, entirely, in, terms, of, the, subjects, that, are, taught, and, as, set, out, within, the, set, of, textbooks, and, forget, the, wider, goals, of, competencies, and, personal, development, this, is, why, a, curriculum, framework, is, important, it, sets, the, subjects, within, this, wider, context, and, shows, how, learning, experiences, within, the, subjects, need, to, contribute, to, the, attainment, of, the, wider, goals, curriculum, is, almost, always, defined, with, relation, to, schooling, according, to, some, it, is, the, major, division, between, formal, and, informal, education, however, under, some, circumstances, it, may, also, be, applied, to, informal, education, or, free, choice, learning, settings, for, instance, a, science, museum, may, have, a, curriculum, of, what, topics, or, exhibits, it, wishes, to, cover, many, after, school, programs, in, the, us, have, tried, to, apply, the, concept, this, typically, has, more, success, when, not, rigidly, clinging, to, the, definition, of, curriculum, as, a, product, or, as, a, body, of, knowledge, to, be, transferred, rather, informal, education, and, free, choice, learning, settings, are, more, suited, to, the, model, of, curriculum, as, practice, or, praxis, action, is, response, it, is, adaptation, adjustment, john, dewey, whatever, the, origins, and, intentions, of, early, curricula, the, function, of, inculcating, culture, had, emerged, by, the, time, of, ancient, babylonia, ancient, roman, curricula, came, to, emphasise, greek, as, well, as, latin, skills, with, emphasis, on, the, study, of, classical, poetry, this, model, influenced, the, curricula, of, medieval, and, renaissance, education, in, the, early, years, of, the, 20th, century, the, traditional, concept, held, of, the, curriculum, was, that, it, is, a, body, of, subjects, or, subject, matter, prepared, by, the, teachers, for, the, students, to, learn, it, was, synonymous, to, the, course, of, study, and, syllabus, in, the, curriculum, the, first, textbook, published, on, the, subject, in, 1918, john, franklin, bobbitt, said, that, curriculum, as, an, idea, has, its, roots, in, the, latin, word, for, race, course, explaining, the, curriculum, as, the, course, of, deeds, and, experiences, through, which, children, become, the, adults, they, should, be, to, succeed, later, in, life, furthermore, the, curriculum, encompasses, the, entire, scope, of, formative, deed, and, experience, occurring, in, and, out, of, school, such, as, experiences, that, are, unplanned, and, undirected, or, those, that, are, intentionally, directed, for, the, purposeful, formation, of, adult, members, of, society, not, only, experiences, occurring, in, school, cf, image, at, right, to, bobbitt, the, curriculum, is, a, social, engineering, arena, per, his, cultural, presumptions, and, social, definitions, his, curricular, formulation, has, two, notable, features, hence, he, defined, the, curriculum, as, an, ideal, rather, than, as, the, concrete, reality, of, the, deeds, and, experiences, that, form, who, and, what, people, become, contemporary, views, of, curriculum, reject, these, features, of, bobbitt, s, postulates, but, retain, the, basis, of, curriculum, as, the, course, of, experience, s, that, form, humans, into, persons, personal, formation, via, curricula, is, studied, both, at, the, personal, and, group, levels, i, e, cultures, and, societies, e, g, professional, formation, academic, discipline, via, historical, experience, the, formation, of, a, group, is, reciprocal, with, the, formation, of, its, individual, participants, although, it, formally, appeared, in, bobbitt, s, definition, curriculum, as, a, course, of, formative, experience, also, pervades, the, work, of, john, dewey, 1859, 1952, who, disagreed, with, bobbitt, on, important, matters, although, bobbitt, s, and, dewey, s, idealistic, understanding, of, curriculum, is, different, from, current, restricted, uses, of, the, word, writers, of, curricula, and, researchers, generally, share, it, as, common, substantive, understanding, of, curriculum, development, does, not, mean, just, getting, something, out, of, the, mind, it, is, a, development, of, experience, and, into, experience, that, is, really, wanted, robert, m, hutchins, 1899, 1977, president, of, the, university, of, chicago, regarded, curriculum, as, permanent, studies, where, the, rules, of, grammar, rhetoric, logic, and, mathematics, for, basic, education, are, emphasized, basic, education, should, emphasize, the, three, rs, and, college, education, should, be, grounded, on, liberal, education, on, the, other, hand, arthur, bestor, 1908, 1994, an, essentialist, believes, that, the, mission, of, the, school, should, be, intellectual, training, hence, curriculum, should, focus, on, the, fundamental, intellectual, disciplines, of, grammar, literature, and, writing, it, should, also, include, mathematics, science, history, and, foreign, language, according, to, joseph, schwab, discipline, is, the, sole, source, of, curriculum, in, our, education, system, curriculum, is, divided, into, chunks, of, knowledge, called, subject, areas, in, basic, education, including, english, mathematics, science, and, social, studies, in, college, discipline, may, include, humanities, sciences, languages, and, many, more, curricula, should, consist, entirely, of, knowledge, which, comes, from, various, disciplines, dewey, proposed, that, learning, the, lesson, should, be, more, interesting, and, beneficial, than, receiving, a, scolding, being, ridiculed, or, being, required, to, stay, after, school, among, other, punishments, thus, a, curriculum, can, be, viewed, as, a, field, of, study, it, is, made, up, of, its, foundations, philosophical, historical, psychological, and, social, foundations, domains, of, knowledge, as, well, as, its, research, theories, and, principles, curricula, as, an, area, of, study, should, be, scholarly, and, theoretical, the, field, is, concerned, with, broad, historical, philosophical, social, issues, and, academics, mark, smith, suggests, a, starting, definition, of, curriculum, offered, by, john, kerr, and, taken, up, by, vic, kelly, in, his, standard, work, on, the, curriculum, all, the, learning, which, is, planned, and, guided, by, the, school, whether, it, is, carried, on, in, groups, or, individually, inside, or, outside, the, school, there, are, four, ways, of, approaching, curriculum, theory, and, practice, in, recent, years, the, field, of, education, and, curriculum, has, expanded, outside, the, walls, of, the, classroom, and, into, other, settings, such, as, museums, within, these, settings, curriculum, is, an, even, broader, topic, including, various, teachers, inanimate, objects, such, as, audio, tour, devices, and, even, the, learners, themselves, as, with, the, traditional, idea, of, curriculum, curriculum, in, a, free, choice, learning, environment, can, consist, of, the, explicit, stated, curriculum, and, the, hidden, curriculum, both, of, which, contribute, to, the, learner, s, experience, and, lessons, from, the, experience, these, elements, are, further, compounded, by, the, setting, cultural, influences, and, the, state, of, mind, of, the, learner, museums, and, other, similar, settings, are, most, commonly, leveraged, within, traditional, classroom, settings, as, enhancements, to, the, curriculum, when, educators, develop, curricula, that, encompass, visits, to, museums, zoos, and, aquariums, on, the, other, hand, to, a, progressivist, a, listing, of, school, subjects, syllabi, courses, of, study, and, lists, of, courses, of, specific, discipline, do, not, make, a, curriculum, these, can, only, be, called, curriculum, if, the, written, materials, are, actualized, by, the, learner, broadly, speaking, curriculum, is, defined, as, the, total, learning, experiences, of, the, individual, this, definition, is, anchored, on, john, dewey, s, definition, of, experience, and, education, he, believed, that, reflective, thinking, is, a, means, that, unifies, curricular, elements, thought, is, not, derived, from, action, but, tested, by, application, caswell, and, campbell, viewed, curricula, as, all, experiences, children, have, under, the, guidance, of, teachers, this, definition, is, shared, by, smith, stanley, and, shores, when, they, defined, curriculum, as, a, sequence, of, potential, experiences, set, up, in, schools, for, the, purpose, of, disciplining, children, and, youth, in, group, ways, of, thinking, and, acting, curriculum, as, a, process, is, when, a, teacher, enters, a, particular, schooling, and, situation, with, the, ability, to, think, critically, an, understanding, of, their, role, and, the, expectations, others, have, of, them, and, a, proposal, for, action, which, sets, out, essential, principles, and, features, of, the, educational, encounter, guided, by, these, they, encourage, conversations, between, and, with, people, in, the, situation, out, of, which, may, come, a, course, of, thinking, and, action, plus, the, teacher, continually, evaluates, the, process, and, what, they, can, see, of, outcomes, marsh, and, willis, view, curricula, as, all, the, experiences, in, the, classroom, which, are, planned, and, enacted, by, teacher, and, also, learned, by, the, students, any, definition, of, curriculum, if, it, is, to, be, practically, effective, and, productive, must, offer, much, more, than, a, statement, about, knowledge, content, or, merely, the, subjects, which, schooling, is, to, teach, transmit, or, deliver, some, would, argue, of, the, course, that, the, values, implicit, in, the, arrangements, made, by, schools, for, their, pupils, are, quite, clearly, in, the, consciousness, of, teachers, and, planners, again, especially, when, the, planners, are, politicians, and, are, equally, clearly, accepted, by, them, as, part, of, what, pupils, should, learn, in, school, even, if, they, are, not, overtly, recognized, by, the, pupils, themselves, in, other, words, those, who, design, curricula, deliberately, plan, the, schools, expressive, culture, if, this, is, the, case, then, the, curriculum, is, hidden, only, to, or, from, the, pupils, and, the, values, to, be, learned, clearly, from, a, part, of, what, is, planned, for, pupils, they, must, therefore, be, accepted, as, fully, a, part, of, the, curriculum, and, especially, as, an, important, focus, because, questions, must, be, asked, concerning, the, legitimacy, of, such, practices, currently, a, spiral, curriculum, is, promoted, as, allowing, students, to, revisit, a, subject, matter, s, content, at, the, different, levels, of, development, of, the, subject, matter, being, studied, the, constructivist, approach, proposes, that, children, learn, best, via, pro, active, engagement, with, the, educational, environment, as, in, learning, through, discovery, a, curriculum, may, be, partly, or, entirely, determined, by, an, external, authoritative, body, e, g, the, national, curriculum, for, england, in, english, schools, or, the, international, primary, curriculum, for, international, schools, crucial, to, the, curriculum, is, the, definition, of, the, course, objectives, that, usually, are, expressed, as, learning, outcomes, and, normally, include, the, program, s, assessment, strategy, these, outcomes, and, assessments, are, grouped, as, units, or, modules, and, therefore, the, curriculum, comprises, a, collection, of, such, units, each, in, turn, comprising, a, specialized, specific, part, of, the, curriculum, so, a, typical, curriculum, includes, communications, numeracy, information, technology, and, social, skills, units, with, specific, specialized, teaching, of, each, core, curricula, are, often, instituted, at, the, primary, and, secondary, levels, by, school, boards, departments, of, education, or, other, administrative, agencies, charged, with, overseeing, education, a, core, curriculum, is, a, curriculum, or, course, of, study, which, is, deemed, central, and, usually, made, mandatory, for, all, students, of, a, school, or, school, system, however, even, when, core, requirements, exist, they, do, not, necessarily, involve, a, requirement, for, students, to, engage, in, one, particular, class, or, activity, for, example, a, school, might, mandate, a, music, appreciation, class, but, students, may, opt, out, if, they, take, a, performing, arts, class, in, australia, the, australian, curriculum, took, effect, nationwide, in, 2014, after, a, curriculum, development, process, that, began, in, 2010, previously, each, state, s, education, department, had, traditionally, established, curricula, the, australian, curriculum, consists, of, one, curriculum, covering, eight, subject, areas, through, year, 10, and, another, covering, fifteen, subjects, for, the, senior, secondary, years, in, canada, each, province, and, territory, has, the, authority, to, create, its, own, curriculum, however, the, northwest, territories, and, nunavut, both, choose, to, use, the, alberta, curriculum, for, select, parts, of, their, curriculum, the, territories, also, use, alberta, s, standardized, tests, in, some, subjects, iran, has, recently, changed, back, to, 6, year, instead, of, 5, elementary, schools, and, two, three, year, junior, and, second, middle, high, schools, there, is, islamic, seminary, hawza, are, also, with, 10, 14, year, programming, the, national, curriculum, of, korea, covers, kindergarten, primary, secondary, and, special, education, the, version, currently, in, place, is, the, 7th, national, curriculum, which, has, been, revised, in, 2007, and, 2009, the, curriculum, provides, a, framework, for, a, common, set, of, subjects, through, 9th, grade, and, elective, subjects, in, grades, 10, through, 12, the, curriculum, in, japan, is, determined, based, on, the, guidelines, for, education, and, the, guidelines, for, learning, presented, by, the, ministry, of, education, culture, sports, science, and, technology, mext, when, deciding, on, the, curriculum, for, each, school, the, school, s, organizers, will, decide, on, the, outline, by, referring, to, the, manuals, and, explanations, prepared, by, the, education, science, and, technology, ministry, and, other, public, offices, and, the, schools, will, decide, on, additional, annual, plans, the, courses, of, education, and, courses, of, study, are, fully, revised, every, 10, years, before, world, war, ii, the, curriculum, was, based, on, the, school, regulations, corresponding, to, each, school, type, the, dutch, system, is, based, on, directives, coming, from, the, ministry, of, education, culture, and, science, ocw, primary, and, secondary, education, use, key, objectives, to, create, curricula, for, primary, education, the, total, number, of, objectives, has, been, reduced, from, 122, in, 1993, to, 58, in, 2006, starting, in, 2009, and, 2010, all, key, objectives, are, obligatory, for, primary, education, the, key, objectives, are, oriented, towards, subject, areas, such, as, language, mathematics, orientation, towards, self, and, the, world, art, and, physical, education, all, of, the, objectives, have, accompanying, concrete, activities, also, final, exams, are, determined, by, the, ocw, and, required, parts, of, those, exams, are, taken, in, a, national, setting, created, by, the, centrale, examencommissie, vaststelling, opgaven, cevo, furthermore, the, ocw, will, determine, the, number, of, hours, to, be, spent, per, subject, apart, from, these, directives, every, school, can, determine, its, own, curriculum, in, 2005, the, nigerian, government, adopted, a, national, basic, education, curriculum, for, grades, 1, through, 9, the, policy, was, an, outgrowth, of, the, universal, basic, education, program, announced, in, 1999, to, provide, free, compulsory, continuous, public, education, for, these, years, in, 2014, the, government, implemented, a, revised, version, of, the, national, curriculum, reducing, the, number, of, subjects, covered, from, 20, to, 10, core, curriculum, has, typically, been, highly, emphasized, in, soviet, and, russian, universities, and, technical, institutes, the, national, curriculum, was, introduced, into, england, wales, and, northern, ireland, as, a, nationwide, curriculum, for, primary, and, secondary, state, schools, following, the, education, reform, act, 1988, it, does, not, apply, to, private, schools, which, may, set, their, own, curricula, but, it, ensures, that, state, schools, of, all, local, education, authorities, have, a, common, curriculum, academy, schools, have, a, significant, degree, of, autonomy, in, deviating, from, the, national, curriculum, every, state, school, must, offer, a, curriculum, which, is, balanced, and, broadly, based, and, which, promotes, the, spiritual, moral, cultural, mental, and, physical, development, of, pupils, at, the, school, and, of, society, and, prepares, pupils, at, the, school, for, the, opportunities, responsibilities, and, experiences, of, later, life, for, each, of, the, statutory, curriculum, subjects, the, secretary, of, state, for, education, is, required, to, set, out, a, programme, of, study, which, outlines, the, content, and, matters, which, must, be, taught, in, those, subjects, at, relevant, key, stages, teachers, should, set, high, expectations, for, every, pupil, they, should, plan, stretching, work, for, pupils, whose, attainment, is, significantly, above, the, expected, standard, teachers, should, use, appropriate, assessment, to, set, targets, which, are, deliberately, ambitious, in, scotland, the, curriculum, for, excellence, cfe, was, introduced, in, august, 2010, in, all, schools, the, national, qualifications, were, introduced, in, 2013, by, the, scottish, qualifications, authority, sqa, the, national, qualifications, include, the, life, skills, coursework, sfl, national, 3, nat3, national, 4, nat4, national, 5, nat5, higher, and, advanced, higher, in, the, u, s, each, state, with, the, individual, school, districts, establishes, the, curricula, taught, each, state, however, builds, its, curriculum, with, great, participation, of, national, academic, subject, groups, selected, by, the, united, states, department, of, education, such, as, the, national, council, of, teachers, of, mathematics, nctm, for, mathematical, instruction, the, common, core, state, standards, initiative, ccssi, promulgates, a, core, set, of, standards, which, are, specific, information, and, skills, a, student, needs, to, know, at, each, grade, level, in, order, to, graduate, states, may, adopt, these, standards, in, part, or, whole, and, expand, upon, them, schools, and, states, depending, on, how, much, control, a, state, gives, to, its, local, schools, then, develop, their, curriculum, to, meet, each, of, these, standards, this, coordination, is, intended, to, make, it, possible, to, use, more, of, the, same, textbooks, across, states, and, to, move, toward, a, more, uniform, minimum, level, of, education, attainment, according, to, the, ccssi, ecisions, on, how, to, implement, the, standards, including, the, right, supports, to, put, in, place, are, made, at, the, state, and, local, levels, as, such, states, and, localities, are, taking, different, approaches, to, implementing, the, standards, and, providing, their, teachers, with, the, supports, they, need, to, help, students, successfully, reach, the, standards, many, educational, institutions, are, currently, trying, to, balance, two, opposing, forces, on, the, one, hand, some, believe, students, should, have, a, common, knowledge, foundation, often, in, the, form, of, a, core, curriculum, whereas, others, want, students, to, be, able, to, pursue, their, own, educational, interests, often, through, early, specialty, in, a, major, or, through, the, free, choice, of, courses, this, tension, has, received, a, large, amount, of, coverage, due, to, harvard, university, s, reorganization, of, its, core, requirements, an, essential, feature, of, curriculum, design, seen, in, every, college, catalog, and, at, every, other, level, of, schooling, is, the, identification, of, prerequisites, for, each, course, these, prerequisites, can, be, satisfied, by, taking, particular, courses, and, in, some, cases, by, examination, or, by, other, means, such, as, work, experience, in, general, more, advanced, courses, in, any, subject, require, some, foundation, in, basic, courses, but, some, coursework, requires, study, in, other, departments, as, in, the, sequence, of, math, classes, required, for, a, physics, major, or, the, language, requirements, for, students, preparing, in, literature, music, or, scientific, research, a, more, detailed, curriculum, design, must, deal, with, prerequisites, within, a, course, for, each, topic, taken, up, this, in, turn, leads, to, the, problems, of, course, organization, and, scheduling, once, the, dependencies, between, topics, are, known, at, the, undergraduate, level, individual, college, and, university, administrations, and, faculties, sometimes, mandate, core, curricula, especially, in, the, liberal, arts, however, because, of, increasing, specialization, and, depth, in, the, student, s, major, field, of, study, a, typical, core, curriculum, in, higher, education, mandates, a, far, smaller, proportion, of, a, student, s, course, work, than, a, high, school, or, elementary, school, core, curriculum, prescribes, among, the, best, known, and, most, expansive, core, curricula, programs, at, leading, american, colleges, and, universities, are, those, of, columbia, university, and, the, university, of, chicago, both, can, take, up, to, two, years, to, complete, without, advanced, standing, and, are, designed, to, foster, critical, skills, in, a, broad, range, of, academic, disciplines, including, the, social, sciences, humanities, physical, and, biological, sciences, mathematics, writing, and, foreign, languages, in, 1999, the, university, of, chicago, announced, plans, to, reduce, and, modify, the, content, of, its, core, curriculum, including, lowering, the, number, of, required, courses, from, 21, to, 15, and, offering, a, wider, range, of, content, when, the, new, york, times, the, economist, and, other, major, news, outlets, picked, up, this, story, the, university, became, the, focal, point, of, a, national, debate, on, education, a, set, of, university, administrators, notably, then, president, hugo, f, sonnenschein, argued, that, reducing, the, core, curriculum, had, become, both, a, financial, and, educational, imperative, as, the, university, was, struggling, to, attract, a, commensurate, volume, of, applicants, to, its, undergraduate, division, compared, to, peer, schools, as, a, result, of, what, was, perceived, by, the, pro, change, camp, as, a, reaction, by, the, average, eighteen, year, old, to, the, expanse, of, the, collegiate, core, as, core, curricula, began, to, diminish, over, the, course, of, the, twentieth, century, at, many, american, schools, some, smaller, institutions, became, famous, for, embracing, a, core, curriculum, that, covers, nearly, the, student, s, entire, undergraduate, education, often, utilizing, classic, texts, of, the, western, canon, to, teach, all, subjects, including, science, five, great, books, colleges, in, the, united, states, follow, this, approach, st, john, s, shimer, thomas, aquinas, gutenberg, college, and, thomas, more, some, colleges, opt, for, the, middle, ground, of, the, continuum, between, specified, and, unspecified, curricula, by, using, a, system, of, distribution, requirements, in, such, a, system, students, are, required, to, take, courses, in, particular, fields, of, learning, but, are, free, to, choose, specific, courses, within, those, fields, other, institutions, have, largely, done, away, with, core, requirements, in, their, entirety, brown, university, offers, the, open, curriculum, implemented, after, a, student, led, reform, movement, in, 1969, which, allows, students, to, take, courses, without, concern, for, any, requirements, except, those, in, their, chosen, concentrations, majors, plus, two, writing, courses, in, this, vein, it, is, possible, for, students, to, graduate, without, taking, college, level, science, or, math, courses, or, to, take, only, science, or, math, courses, amherst, college, requires, that, students, take, one, of, a, list, of, first, year, seminars, but, has, no, required, classes, or, distribution, requirements, similarly, grinnell, college, requires, students, to, take, a, first, year, tutorial, in, their, first, semester, and, has, no, other, class, or, distribution, requirements, others, include, evergreen, state, college, hamilton, college, and, smith, college, wesleyan, university, is, another, school, that, has, not, and, does, not, require, any, set, distribution, of, courses, however, wesleyan, does, make, clear, general, education, expectations, such, that, if, a, student, does, not, meet, these, expectations, he, she, would, not, be, eligible, for, academic, honors, upon, graduation, gender, inequality, in, curricula, is, how, men, and, women, are, not, treated, equally, in, several, types, of, curricula, more, precisely, gender, inequality, is, visible, in, the, curriculum, of, both, schools, and, teacher, education, institutes, teis, physical, education, pe, is, an, example, where, gender, equality, issues, are, highlighted, because, of, preconceived, stereotyping, of, boys, and, girls, the, general, belief, is, that, boys, are, better, at, physical, activities, than, girls, and, that, girls, are, better, at, home, activities, such, as, sewing, and, cooking, this, is, the, case, in, many, cultures, around, the, world, and, is, not, specific, to, one, culture, only
