the, algic, languages, also, algonquian, wiyot, yurok, or, algonquian, ritwan, are, an, indigenous, language, family, of, north, america, most, algic, languages, belong, to, the, algonquian, subfamily, dispersed, over, a, broad, area, from, the, rocky, mountains, to, atlantic, canada, the, other, algic, languages, are, the, yurok, and, wiyot, of, northwestern, california, which, despite, their, geographic, proximity, are, not, closely, related, all, these, languages, descend, from, proto, algic, a, second, order, proto, language, estimated, to, have, been, spoken, about, 7, 000, years, ago, and, reconstructed, using, the, reconstructed, proto, algonquian, language, and, the, wiyot, and, yurok, languages, the, term, algic, was, first, coined, by, henry, schoolcraft, in, his, algic, researches, published, in, 1839, schoolcraft, defined, the, term, as, derived, from, the, words, allegheny, and, atlantic, in, reference, to, the, indigenous, people, anciently, located, in, this, geographical, area, schoolcraft, s, terminology, was, not, retained, the, peoples, he, called, algic, were, later, included, among, the, speakers, of, algonquian, languages, this, language, group, is, also, referred, to, as, algonquian, ritwan, and, wiyot, yurok, algonquian, when, edward, sapir, proposed, that, the, well, established, algonquian, family, was, genetically, related, to, the, wiyot, and, yurok, languages, of, northern, california, he, applied, the, term, algic, to, this, larger, family, the, algic, urheimat, is, thought, to, have, been, located, in, the, northwestern, united, states, somewhere, between, the, suspected, homeland, of, the, algonquian, branch, to, the, west, of, lake, superior, according, to, ives, goddard, and, the, earliest, known, location, of, the, wiyot, and, yurok, along, the, middle, columbia, river, according, to, whistler, the, genetic, relation, of, wiyot, and, yurok, to, algonquian, was, first, proposed, by, edward, sapir, 1913, 1915, 1923, and, argued, against, by, algonquianist, truman, michelson, 1914, 1914, 1935, according, to, lyle, campbell, 1997, the, relationship, has, subsequently, been, demonstrated, to, the, satisfaction, of, all, this, controversy, in, the, early, classification, of, north, american, languages, was, called, the, ritwan, controversy, because, wiyot, and, yurok, were, assigned, to, a, genetic, grouping, called, ritwan, most, specialists, now, reject, the, validity, of, the, ritwan, genetic, node, berman, 1982, suggested, that, wiyot, and, yurok, share, sound, changes, not, shared, by, the, rest, of, algic, which, would, be, explainable, by, either, areal, diffusion, or, genetic, relatedness, proulx, 2004, argued, against, berman, s, conclusion, of, common, sound, changes, more, recently, sergei, nikolaev, has, argued, in, two, papers, for, a, systematic, relationship, between, the, nivkh, language, of, sakhalin, and, the, amur, river, basin, and, the, algic, languages, and, a, secondary, relationship, between, these, two, together, and, the, wakashan, languages
