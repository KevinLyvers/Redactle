anthropology, is, the, scientific, study, of, humanity, concerned, with, human, behavior, human, biology, cultures, societies, and, linguistics, in, both, the, present, and, past, including, archaic, humans, social, anthropology, studies, patterns, of, behavior, while, cultural, anthropology, studies, cultural, meaning, including, norms, and, values, the, term, sociocultural, anthropology, is, commonly, used, today, linguistic, anthropology, studies, how, language, influences, social, life, biological, or, physical, anthropology, studies, the, biological, development, of, humans, archaeology, often, termed, as, anthropology, of, the, past, studies, human, activity, through, investigation, of, physical, evidence, it, is, considered, a, branch, of, anthropology, in, north, america, and, asia, while, in, europe, archaeology, is, viewed, as, a, discipline, in, its, own, right, or, grouped, under, other, related, disciplines, such, as, history, and, palaeontology, the, abstract, noun, anthropology, is, first, attested, in, reference, to, history, its, present, use, first, appeared, in, renaissance, germany, in, the, works, of, magnus, hundt, and, otto, casmann, their, neo, latin, anthropologia, derived, from, the, combining, forms, of, the, greek, words, nthr, pos, human, and, l, gos, study, its, adjectival, form, appeared, in, the, works, of, aristotle, it, began, to, be, used, in, english, possibly, via, french, anthropologie, by, the, early, 18th, century, in, 1647, the, bartholins, early, scholars, of, the, university, of, copenhagen, defined, l, anthropologie, as, follows, anthropology, that, is, to, say, the, science, that, treats, of, man, is, divided, ordinarily, and, with, reason, into, anatomy, which, considers, the, body, and, the, parts, and, psychology, which, speaks, of, the, soul, sporadic, use, of, the, term, for, some, of, the, subject, matter, occurred, subsequently, such, as, the, use, by, tienne, serres, in, 1839, to, describe, the, natural, history, or, paleontology, of, man, based, on, comparative, anatomy, and, the, creation, of, a, chair, in, anthropology, and, ethnography, in, 1850, at, the, french, national, museum, of, natural, history, by, jean, louis, armand, de, quatrefages, de, br, au, various, short, lived, organizations, of, anthropologists, had, already, been, formed, the, soci, t, ethnologique, de, paris, the, first, to, use, the, term, ethnology, was, formed, in, 1839, and, focused, on, methodically, studying, human, races, after, the, death, of, its, founder, william, fr, d, ric, edwards, in, 1842, it, gradually, declined, in, activity, until, it, eventually, dissolved, in, 1862, meanwhile, the, ethnological, society, of, new, york, currently, the, american, ethnological, society, was, founded, on, its, model, in, 1842, as, well, as, the, ethnological, society, of, london, in, 1843, a, break, away, group, of, the, aborigines, protection, society, these, anthropologists, of, the, times, were, liberal, anti, slavery, and, pro, human, rights, activists, they, maintained, international, connections, anthropology, and, many, other, current, fields, are, the, intellectual, results, of, the, comparative, methods, developed, in, the, earlier, 19th, century, theorists, in, diverse, fields, such, as, anatomy, linguistics, and, ethnology, started, making, feature, by, feature, comparisons, of, their, subject, matters, and, were, beginning, to, suspect, that, similarities, between, animals, languages, and, folkways, were, the, result, of, processes, or, laws, unknown, to, them, then, for, them, the, publication, of, charles, darwin, s, on, the, origin, of, species, was, the, epiphany, of, everything, they, had, begun, to, suspect, darwin, himself, arrived, at, his, conclusions, through, comparison, of, species, he, had, seen, in, agronomy, and, in, the, wild, darwin, and, wallace, unveiled, evolution, in, the, late, 1850s, there, was, an, immediate, rush, to, bring, it, into, the, social, sciences, paul, broca, in, paris, was, in, the, process, of, breaking, away, from, the, soci, t, de, biologie, to, form, the, first, of, the, explicitly, anthropological, societies, the, soci, t, d, anthropologie, de, paris, meeting, for, the, first, time, in, paris, in, 1859, when, he, read, darwin, he, became, an, immediate, convert, to, transformisme, as, the, french, called, evolutionism, his, definition, now, became, the, study, of, the, human, group, considered, as, a, whole, in, its, details, and, in, relation, to, the, rest, of, nature, broca, being, what, today, would, be, called, a, neurosurgeon, had, taken, an, interest, in, the, pathology, of, speech, he, wanted, to, localize, the, difference, between, man, and, the, other, animals, which, appeared, to, reside, in, speech, he, discovered, the, speech, center, of, the, human, brain, today, called, broca, s, area, after, him, his, interest, was, mainly, in, biological, anthropology, but, a, german, philosopher, specializing, in, psychology, theodor, waitz, took, up, the, theme, of, general, and, social, anthropology, in, his, six, volume, work, entitled, die, anthropologie, der, naturv, lker, 1859, 1864, the, title, was, soon, translated, as, the, anthropology, of, primitive, peoples, the, last, two, volumes, were, published, posthumously, waitz, defined, anthropology, as, the, science, of, the, nature, of, man, following, broca, s, lead, waitz, points, out, that, anthropology, is, a, new, field, which, would, gather, material, from, other, fields, but, would, differ, from, them, in, the, use, of, comparative, anatomy, physiology, and, psychology, to, differentiate, man, from, the, animals, nearest, to, him, he, stresses, that, the, data, of, comparison, must, be, empirical, gathered, by, experimentation, the, history, of, civilization, as, well, as, ethnology, are, to, be, brought, into, the, comparison, it, is, to, be, presumed, fundamentally, that, the, species, man, is, a, unity, and, that, the, same, laws, of, thought, are, applicable, to, all, men, waitz, was, influential, among, british, ethnologists, in, 1863, the, explorer, richard, francis, burton, and, the, speech, therapist, james, hunt, broke, away, from, the, ethnological, society, of, london, to, form, the, anthropological, society, of, london, which, henceforward, would, follow, the, path, of, the, new, anthropology, rather, than, just, ethnology, it, was, the, 2nd, society, dedicated, to, general, anthropology, in, existence, representatives, from, the, french, soci, t, were, present, though, not, broca, in, his, keynote, address, printed, in, the, first, volume, of, its, new, publication, the, anthropological, review, hunt, stressed, the, work, of, waitz, adopting, his, definitions, as, a, standard, among, the, first, associates, were, the, young, edward, burnett, tylor, inventor, of, cultural, anthropology, and, his, brother, alfred, tylor, a, geologist, previously, edward, had, referred, to, himself, as, an, ethnologist, subsequently, an, anthropologist, similar, organizations, in, other, countries, followed, the, anthropological, society, of, madrid, 1865, the, american, anthropological, association, in, 1902, the, anthropological, society, of, vienna, 1870, the, italian, society, of, anthropology, and, ethnology, 1871, and, many, others, subsequently, the, majority, of, these, were, evolutionists, one, notable, exception, was, the, berlin, society, for, anthropology, ethnology, and, prehistory, 1869, founded, by, rudolph, virchow, known, for, his, vituperative, attacks, on, the, evolutionists, not, religious, himself, he, insisted, that, darwin, s, conclusions, lacked, empirical, foundation, during, the, last, three, decades, of, the, 19th, century, a, proliferation, of, anthropological, societies, and, associations, occurred, most, independent, most, publishing, their, own, journals, and, all, international, in, membership, and, association, the, major, theorists, belonged, to, these, organizations, they, supported, the, gradual, osmosis, of, anthropology, curricula, into, the, major, institutions, of, higher, learning, by, 1898, 48, educational, institutions, in, 13, countries, had, some, curriculum, in, anthropology, none, of, the, 75, faculty, members, were, under, a, department, named, anthropology, anthropology, as, a, specialized, field, of, academic, study, developed, much, through, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, then, it, rapidly, expanded, beginning, in, the, early, 20th, century, to, the, point, where, many, of, the, world, s, higher, educational, institutions, typically, included, anthropology, departments, thousands, of, anthropology, departments, have, come, into, existence, and, anthropology, has, also, diversified, from, a, few, major, subdivisions, to, dozens, more, practical, anthropology, the, use, of, anthropological, knowledge, and, technique, to, solve, specific, problems, has, arrived, for, example, the, presence, of, buried, victims, might, stimulate, the, use, of, a, forensic, archaeologist, to, recreate, the, final, scene, the, organization, has, also, reached, a, global, level, for, example, the, world, council, of, anthropological, associations, wcaa, a, network, of, national, regional, and, international, associations, that, aims, to, promote, worldwide, communication, and, cooperation, in, anthropology, currently, contains, members, from, about, three, dozen, nations, since, the, work, of, franz, boas, and, bronis, aw, malinowski, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, social, anthropology, in, great, britain, and, cultural, anthropology, in, the, us, have, been, distinguished, from, other, social, sciences, by, their, emphasis, on, cross, cultural, comparisons, long, term, in, depth, examination, of, context, and, the, importance, they, place, on, participant, observation, or, experiential, immersion, in, the, area, of, research, cultural, anthropology, in, particular, has, emphasized, cultural, relativism, holism, and, the, use, of, findings, to, frame, cultural, critiques, this, has, been, particularly, prominent, in, the, united, states, from, boas, arguments, against, 19th, century, racial, ideology, through, margaret, mead, s, advocacy, for, gender, equality, and, sexual, liberation, to, current, criticisms, of, post, colonial, oppression, and, promotion, of, multiculturalism, ethnography, is, one, of, its, primary, research, designs, as, well, as, the, text, that, is, generated, from, anthropological, fieldwork, in, great, britain, and, the, commonwealth, countries, the, british, tradition, of, social, anthropology, tends, to, dominate, in, the, united, states, anthropology, has, traditionally, been, divided, into, the, four, field, approach, developed, by, franz, boas, in, the, early, 20th, century, biological, or, physical, anthropology, social, cultural, or, sociocultural, anthropology, archaeological, anthropology, and, linguistic, anthropology, these, fields, frequently, overlap, but, tend, to, use, different, methodologies, and, techniques, european, countries, with, overseas, colonies, tended, to, practice, more, ethnology, a, term, coined, and, defined, by, adam, f, koll, r, in, 1783, it, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, sociocultural, anthropology, in, the, parts, of, the, world, that, were, influenced, by, the, european, tradition, anthropology, is, a, global, discipline, involving, humanities, social, sciences, and, natural, sciences, anthropology, builds, upon, knowledge, from, natural, sciences, including, the, discoveries, about, the, origin, and, evolution, of, homo, sapiens, human, physical, traits, human, behavior, the, variations, among, different, groups, of, humans, how, the, evolutionary, past, of, homo, sapiens, has, influenced, its, social, organization, and, culture, and, from, social, sciences, including, the, organization, of, human, social, and, cultural, relations, institutions, social, conflicts, etc, early, anthropology, originated, in, classical, greece, and, persia, and, studied, and, tried, to, understand, observable, cultural, diversity, such, as, by, al, biruni, of, the, islamic, golden, age, as, such, anthropology, has, been, central, in, the, development, of, several, new, late, 20th, century, interdisciplinary, fields, such, as, cognitive, science, global, studies, and, various, ethnic, studies, according, to, clifford, geertz, anthropology, is, perhaps, the, last, of, the, great, nineteenth, century, conglomerate, disciplines, still, for, the, most, part, organizationally, intact, long, after, natural, history, moral, philosophy, philology, and, political, economy, have, dissolved, into, their, specialized, successors, it, has, remained, a, diffuse, assemblage, of, ethnology, human, biology, comparative, linguistics, and, prehistory, held, together, mainly, by, the, vested, interests, sunk, costs, and, administrative, habits, of, academia, and, by, a, romantic, image, of, comprehensive, scholarship, sociocultural, anthropology, has, been, heavily, influenced, by, structuralist, and, postmodern, theories, as, well, as, a, shift, toward, the, analysis, of, modern, societies, during, the, 1970s, and, 1990s, there, was, an, epistemological, shift, away, from, the, positivist, traditions, that, had, largely, informed, the, discipline, during, this, shift, enduring, questions, about, the, nature, and, production, of, knowledge, came, to, occupy, a, central, place, in, cultural, and, social, anthropology, in, contrast, archaeology, and, biological, anthropology, remained, largely, positivist, due, to, this, difference, in, epistemology, the, four, sub, fields, of, anthropology, have, lacked, cohesion, over, the, last, several, decades, sociocultural, anthropology, draws, together, the, principal, axes, of, cultural, anthropology, and, social, anthropology, cultural, anthropology, is, the, comparative, study, of, the, manifold, ways, in, which, people, make, sense, of, the, world, around, them, while, social, anthropology, is, the, study, of, the, relationships, among, individuals, and, groups, cultural, anthropology, is, more, related, to, philosophy, literature, and, the, arts, how, one, s, culture, affects, the, experience, for, self, and, group, contributing, to, a, more, complete, understanding, of, the, people, s, knowledge, customs, and, institutions, while, social, anthropology, is, more, related, to, sociology, and, history, in, that, it, helps, develop, an, understanding, of, social, structures, typically, of, others, and, other, populations, such, as, minorities, subgroups, dissidents, etc, there, is, no, hard, and, fast, distinction, between, them, and, these, categories, overlap, to, a, considerable, degree, inquiry, in, sociocultural, anthropology, is, guided, in, part, by, cultural, relativism, the, attempt, to, understand, other, societies, in, terms, of, their, own, cultural, symbols, and, values, accepting, other, cultures, in, their, own, terms, moderates, reductionism, in, cross, cultural, comparison, this, project, is, often, accommodated, in, the, field, of, ethnography, ethnography, can, refer, to, both, a, methodology, and, the, product, of, ethnographic, research, i, e, an, ethnographic, monograph, as, a, methodology, ethnography, is, based, upon, long, term, fieldwork, within, a, community, or, other, research, site, participant, observation, is, one, of, the, foundational, methods, of, social, and, cultural, anthropology, ethnology, involves, the, systematic, comparison, of, different, cultures, the, process, of, participant, observation, can, be, especially, helpful, to, understanding, a, culture, from, an, emic, conceptual, vs, etic, or, technical, point, of, view, the, study, of, kinship, and, social, organization, is, a, central, focus, of, sociocultural, anthropology, as, kinship, is, a, human, universal, sociocultural, anthropology, also, covers, economic, and, political, organization, law, and, conflict, resolution, patterns, of, consumption, and, exchange, material, culture, technology, infrastructure, gender, relations, ethnicity, childrearing, and, socialization, religion, myth, symbols, values, etiquette, worldview, sports, music, nutrition, recreation, games, food, festivals, and, language, which, is, also, the, object, of, study, in, linguistic, anthropology, comparison, across, cultures, is, a, key, element, of, method, in, sociocultural, anthropology, including, the, industrialized, and, de, industrialized, west, the, standard, cross, cultural, sample, sccs, includes, 186, such, cultures, biological, anthropology, and, physical, anthropology, are, synonymous, terms, to, describe, anthropological, research, focused, on, the, study, of, humans, and, non, human, primates, in, their, biological, evolutionary, and, demographic, dimensions, it, examines, the, biological, and, social, factors, that, have, affected, the, evolution, of, humans, and, other, primates, and, that, generate, maintain, or, change, contemporary, genetic, and, physiological, variation, archaeology, is, the, study, of, the, human, past, through, its, material, remains, artifacts, faunal, remains, and, human, altered, landscapes, are, evidence, of, the, cultural, and, material, lives, of, past, societies, archaeologists, examine, material, remains, in, order, to, deduce, patterns, of, past, human, behavior, and, cultural, practices, ethnoarchaeology, is, a, type, of, archaeology, that, studies, the, practices, and, material, remains, of, living, human, groups, in, order, to, gain, a, better, understanding, of, the, evidence, left, behind, by, past, human, groups, who, are, presumed, to, have, lived, in, similar, ways, linguistic, anthropology, not, to, be, confused, with, anthropological, linguistics, seeks, to, understand, the, processes, of, human, communications, verbal, and, non, verbal, variation, in, language, across, time, and, space, the, social, uses, of, language, and, the, relationship, between, language, and, culture, it, is, the, branch, of, anthropology, that, brings, linguistic, methods, to, bear, on, anthropological, problems, linking, the, analysis, of, linguistic, forms, and, processes, to, the, interpretation, of, sociocultural, processes, linguistic, anthropologists, often, draw, on, related, fields, including, sociolinguistics, pragmatics, cognitive, linguistics, semiotics, discourse, analysis, and, narrative, analysis, ethnography, is, a, method, of, analysing, social, or, cultural, interaction, it, often, involves, participant, observation, though, an, ethnographer, may, also, draw, from, texts, written, by, participants, of, in, social, interactions, ethnography, views, first, hand, experience, and, social, context, as, important, tim, ingold, distinguishes, ethnography, from, anthropology, arguing, that, anthropology, tries, to, construct, general, theories, of, human, experience, applicable, in, general, and, novel, settings, while, ethnography, concerns, itself, with, fidelity, he, argues, that, the, anthropologist, must, make, his, writing, consistent, with, their, understanding, of, literature, and, other, theory, but, notes, that, ethnography, may, be, of, use, to, the, anthropologists, and, the, fields, inform, one, another, one, of, the, central, problems, in, the, anthropology, of, art, concerns, the, universality, of, art, as, a, cultural, phenomenon, several, anthropologists, have, noted, that, the, western, categories, of, painting, sculpture, or, literature, conceived, as, independent, artistic, activities, do, not, exist, or, exist, in, a, significantly, different, form, in, most, non, western, contexts, to, surmount, this, difficulty, anthropologists, of, art, have, focused, on, formal, features, in, objects, which, without, exclusively, being, artistic, have, certain, evident, aesthetic, qualities, boas, primitive, art, claude, l, vi, strauss, the, way, of, the, masks, 1982, or, geertz, s, art, as, cultural, system, 1983, are, some, examples, in, this, trend, to, transform, the, anthropology, of, art, into, an, anthropology, of, culturally, specific, aesthetics, media, anthropology, also, known, as, the, anthropology, of, media, or, mass, media, emphasizes, ethnographic, studies, as, a, means, of, understanding, producers, audiences, and, other, cultural, and, social, aspects, of, mass, media, the, types, of, ethnographic, contexts, explored, range, from, contexts, of, media, production, e, g, ethnographies, of, newsrooms, in, newspapers, journalists, in, the, field, film, production, to, contexts, of, media, reception, following, audiences, in, their, everyday, responses, to, media, other, types, include, cyber, anthropology, a, relatively, new, area, of, internet, research, as, well, as, ethnographies, of, other, areas, of, research, which, happen, to, involve, media, such, as, development, work, social, movements, or, health, education, this, is, in, addition, to, many, classic, ethnographic, contexts, where, media, such, as, radio, the, press, new, media, and, television, have, started, to, make, their, presences, felt, since, the, early, 1990s, ethnomusicology, is, an, academic, field, encompassing, various, approaches, to, the, study, of, music, broadly, defined, that, emphasize, its, cultural, social, material, cognitive, biological, and, other, dimensions, or, contexts, instead, of, or, in, addition, to, its, isolated, sound, component, or, any, particular, repertoire, ethnomusicology, can, be, used, in, a, wide, variety, of, fields, such, as, teaching, politics, cultural, anthropology, etc, while, the, origins, of, ethnomusicology, date, back, to, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, it, was, formally, termed, ethnomusicology, by, dutch, scholar, jaap, kunst, c, 1950, later, the, influence, of, study, in, this, area, spawned, the, creation, of, the, periodical, ethnomusicology, and, the, society, of, ethnomusicology, visual, anthropology, is, concerned, in, part, with, the, study, and, production, of, ethnographic, photography, film, and, since, the, mid, 1990s, new, media, while, the, term, is, sometimes, used, interchangeably, with, ethnographic, film, visual, anthropology, also, encompasses, the, anthropological, study, of, visual, representation, including, areas, such, as, performance, museums, art, and, the, production, and, reception, of, mass, media, visual, representations, from, all, cultures, such, as, sandpaintings, tattoos, sculptures, and, reliefs, cave, paintings, scrimshaw, jewelry, hieroglyphs, paintings, and, photographs, are, included, in, the, focus, of, visual, anthropology, economic, anthropology, attempts, to, explain, human, economic, behavior, in, its, widest, historic, geographic, and, cultural, scope, it, has, a, complex, relationship, with, the, discipline, of, economics, of, which, it, is, highly, critical, its, origins, as, a, sub, field, of, anthropology, begin, with, the, polish, british, founder, of, anthropology, bronis, aw, malinowski, and, his, french, compatriot, marcel, mauss, on, the, nature, of, gift, giving, exchange, or, reciprocity, as, an, alternative, to, market, exchange, economic, anthropology, remains, for, the, most, part, focused, upon, exchange, the, school, of, thought, derived, from, marx, and, known, as, political, economy, focuses, on, production, in, contrast, economic, anthropologists, have, abandoned, the, primitivist, niche, they, were, relegated, to, by, economists, and, have, now, turned, to, examine, corporations, banks, and, the, global, financial, system, from, an, anthropological, perspective, political, economy, in, anthropology, is, the, application, of, the, theories, and, methods, of, historical, materialism, to, the, traditional, concerns, of, anthropology, including, but, not, limited, to, non, capitalist, societies, political, economy, introduced, questions, of, history, and, colonialism, to, ahistorical, anthropological, theories, of, social, structure, and, culture, three, main, areas, of, interest, rapidly, developed, the, first, of, these, areas, was, concerned, with, the, pre, capitalist, societies, that, were, subject, to, evolutionary, tribal, stereotypes, sahlin, s, work, on, hunter, gatherers, as, the, original, affluent, society, did, much, to, dissipate, that, image, the, second, area, was, concerned, with, the, vast, majority, of, the, world, s, population, at, the, time, the, peasantry, many, of, whom, were, involved, in, complex, revolutionary, wars, such, as, in, vietnam, the, third, area, was, on, colonialism, imperialism, and, the, creation, of, the, capitalist, world, system, more, recently, these, political, economists, have, more, directly, addressed, issues, of, industrial, and, post, industrial, capitalism, around, the, world, applied, anthropology, refers, to, the, application, of, the, method, and, theory, of, anthropology, to, the, analysis, and, solution, of, practical, problems, it, is, a, complex, of, related, research, based, instrumental, methods, which, produce, change, or, stability, in, specific, cultural, systems, through, the, provision, of, data, initiation, of, direct, action, and, or, the, formulation, of, policy, applied, anthropology, is, the, practical, side, of, anthropological, research, it, includes, researcher, involvement, and, activism, within, the, participating, community, it, is, closely, related, to, development, anthropology, distinct, from, the, more, critical, anthropology, of, development, anthropology, of, development, tends, to, view, development, from, a, critical, perspective, the, kind, of, issues, addressed, and, implications, for, the, approach, involve, pondering, why, if, a, key, development, goal, is, to, alleviate, poverty, is, poverty, increasing, why, is, there, such, a, gap, between, plans, and, outcomes, why, are, those, working, in, development, so, willing, to, disregard, history, and, the, lessons, it, might, offer, why, is, development, so, externally, driven, rather, than, having, an, internal, basis, in, short, why, does, so, much, planned, development, fail, kinship, can, refer, both, to, the, study, of, the, patterns, of, social, relationships, in, one, or, more, human, cultures, or, it, can, refer, to, the, patterns, of, social, relationships, themselves, over, its, history, anthropology, has, developed, a, number, of, related, concepts, and, terms, such, as, descent, descent, groups, lineages, affines, cognates, and, even, fictive, kinship, broadly, kinship, patterns, may, be, considered, to, include, people, related, both, by, descent, one, s, social, relations, during, development, and, also, relatives, by, marriage, within, kinship, you, have, two, different, families, people, have, their, biological, families, and, it, is, the, people, they, share, dna, with, this, is, called, consanguinity, or, blood, ties, people, can, also, have, a, chosen, family, in, which, they, chose, who, they, want, to, be, a, part, of, their, family, in, some, cases, people, are, closer, with, their, chosen, family, more, than, with, their, biological, families, feminist, anthropology, is, a, four, field, approach, to, anthropology, archeological, biological, cultural, linguistic, that, seeks, to, reduce, male, bias, in, research, findings, anthropological, hiring, practices, and, the, scholarly, production, of, knowledge, anthropology, engages, often, with, feminists, from, non, western, traditions, whose, perspectives, and, experiences, can, differ, from, those, of, white, feminists, of, europe, america, and, elsewhere, from, the, perspective, of, the, western, world, historically, such, peripheral, perspectives, have, been, ignored, observed, only, from, an, outsider, perspective, and, regarded, as, less, valid, or, less, important, than, knowledge, from, the, western, world, exploring, and, addressing, that, double, bias, against, women, from, marginalized, racial, or, ethnic, groups, is, of, particular, interest, in, intersectional, feminist, anthropology, feminist, anthropologists, have, stated, that, their, publications, have, contributed, to, anthropology, along, the, way, correcting, against, the, systemic, biases, beginning, with, the, patriarchal, origins, of, anthropology, and, academia, and, note, that, from, 1891, to, 1930, doctorates, in, anthropology, went, to, males, more, than, 85, more, than, 81, were, under, 35, and, only, 7, 2, to, anyone, over, 40, years, old, thus, reflecting, an, age, gap, in, the, pursuit, of, anthropology, by, first, wave, feminists, until, later, in, life, this, correction, of, systemic, bias, may, include, mainstream, feminist, theory, history, linguistics, archaeology, and, anthropology, feminist, anthropologists, are, often, concerned, with, the, construction, of, gender, across, societies, gender, constructs, are, of, particular, interest, when, studying, sexism, according, to, st, clair, drake, vera, mae, green, was, until, ell, into, the, 1960s, the, only, african, american, female, anthropologist, who, was, also, a, caribbeanist, she, studied, ethnic, and, family, relations, in, the, caribbean, as, well, as, the, united, states, and, thereby, tried, to, improve, the, way, black, life, experiences, and, culture, were, studied, however, zora, neale, hurston, although, often, primarily, considered, to, be, a, literary, author, was, trained, in, anthropology, by, franz, boas, and, published, tell, my, horse, about, her, anthropological, observations, of, voodoo, in, the, caribbean, 1938, feminist, anthropology, is, inclusive, of, the, anthropology, of, birth, as, a, specialization, which, is, the, anthropological, study, of, pregnancy, and, childbirth, within, cultures, and, societies, medical, anthropology, is, an, interdisciplinary, field, which, studies, human, health, and, disease, health, care, systems, and, biocultural, adaptation, it, is, believed, that, william, caudell, was, the, first, to, discover, the, field, of, medical, anthropology, currently, research, in, medical, anthropology, is, one, of, the, main, growth, areas, in, the, field, of, anthropology, as, a, whole, it, focuses, on, the, following, six, basic, fields, other, subjects, that, have, become, central, to, medical, anthropology, worldwide, are, violence, and, social, suffering, farmer, 1999, 2003, beneduce, 2010, as, well, as, other, issues, that, involve, physical, and, psychological, harm, and, suffering, that, are, not, a, result, of, illness, on, the, other, hand, there, are, fields, that, intersect, with, medical, anthropology, in, terms, of, research, methodology, and, theoretical, production, such, as, cultural, psychiatry, and, transcultural, psychiatry, or, ethnopsychiatry, nutritional, anthropology, is, a, synthetic, concept, that, deals, with, the, interplay, between, economic, systems, nutritional, status, and, food, security, and, how, changes, in, the, former, affect, the, latter, if, economic, and, environmental, changes, in, a, community, affect, access, to, food, food, security, and, dietary, health, then, this, interplay, between, culture, and, biology, is, in, turn, connected, to, broader, historical, and, economic, trends, associated, with, globalization, nutritional, status, affects, overall, health, status, work, performance, potential, and, the, overall, potential, for, economic, development, either, in, terms, of, human, development, or, traditional, western, models, for, any, given, group, of, people, psychological, anthropology, is, an, interdisciplinary, subfield, of, anthropology, that, studies, the, interaction, of, cultural, and, mental, processes, this, subfield, tends, to, focus, on, ways, in, which, humans, development, and, enculturation, within, a, particular, cultural, group, with, its, own, history, language, practices, and, conceptual, categories, shape, processes, of, human, cognition, emotion, perception, motivation, and, mental, health, it, also, examines, how, the, understanding, of, cognition, emotion, motivation, and, similar, psychological, processes, inform, or, constrain, our, models, of, cultural, and, social, processes, cognitive, anthropology, seeks, to, explain, patterns, of, shared, knowledge, cultural, innovation, and, transmission, over, time, and, space, using, the, methods, and, theories, of, the, cognitive, sciences, especially, experimental, psychology, and, evolutionary, biology, often, through, close, collaboration, with, historians, ethnographers, archaeologists, linguists, musicologists, and, other, specialists, engaged, in, the, description, and, interpretation, of, cultural, forms, cognitive, anthropology, is, concerned, with, what, people, from, different, groups, know, and, how, that, implicit, knowledge, changes, the, way, people, perceive, and, relate, to, the, world, around, them, transpersonal, anthropology, studies, the, relationship, between, altered, states, of, consciousness, and, culture, as, with, transpersonal, psychology, the, field, is, much, concerned, with, altered, states, of, consciousness, asc, and, transpersonal, experience, however, the, field, differs, from, mainstream, transpersonal, psychology, in, taking, more, cognizance, of, cross, cultural, issues, for, instance, the, roles, of, myth, ritual, diet, and, text, in, evoking, and, interpreting, extraordinary, experiences, political, anthropology, concerns, the, structure, of, political, systems, looked, at, from, the, basis, of, the, structure, of, societies, political, anthropology, developed, as, a, discipline, concerned, primarily, with, politics, in, stateless, societies, a, new, development, started, from, the, 1960s, and, is, still, unfolding, anthropologists, started, increasingly, to, study, more, complex, social, settings, in, which, the, presence, of, states, bureaucracies, and, markets, entered, both, ethnographic, accounts, and, analysis, of, local, phenomena, the, turn, towards, complex, societies, meant, that, political, themes, were, taken, up, at, two, main, levels, firstly, anthropologists, continued, to, study, political, organization, and, political, phenomena, that, lay, outside, the, state, regulated, sphere, as, in, patron, client, relations, or, tribal, political, organization, secondly, anthropologists, slowly, started, to, develop, a, disciplinary, concern, with, states, and, their, institutions, and, on, the, relationship, between, formal, and, informal, political, institutions, an, anthropology, of, the, state, developed, and, it, is, a, most, thriving, field, today, geertz, s, comparative, work, on, negara, the, balinese, state, is, an, early, famous, example, legal, anthropology, or, anthropology, of, law, specializes, in, the, cross, cultural, study, of, social, ordering, earlier, legal, anthropological, research, often, focused, more, narrowly, on, conflict, management, crime, sanctions, or, formal, regulation, more, recent, applications, include, issues, such, as, human, rights, legal, pluralism, and, political, uprisings, public, anthropology, was, created, by, robert, borofsky, a, professor, at, hawaii, pacific, university, to, demonstrate, the, ability, of, anthropology, and, anthropologists, to, effectively, address, problems, beyond, the, discipline, illuminating, larger, social, issues, of, our, times, as, well, as, encouraging, broad, public, conversations, about, them, with, the, explicit, goal, of, fostering, social, change, cyborg, anthropology, originated, as, a, sub, focus, group, within, the, american, anthropological, association, s, annual, meeting, in, 1993, the, sub, group, was, very, closely, related, to, sts, and, the, society, for, the, social, studies, of, science, donna, haraway, s, 1985, cyborg, manifesto, could, be, considered, the, founding, document, of, cyborg, anthropology, by, first, exploring, the, philosophical, and, sociological, ramifications, of, the, term, cyborg, anthropology, studies, humankind, and, its, relations, with, the, technological, systems, it, has, built, specifically, modern, technological, systems, that, have, reflexively, shaped, notions, of, what, it, means, to, be, human, beings, digital, anthropology, is, the, study, of, the, relationship, between, humans, and, digital, era, technology, and, extends, to, various, areas, where, anthropology, and, technology, intersect, it, is, sometimes, grouped, with, sociocultural, anthropology, and, sometimes, considered, part, of, material, culture, the, field, is, new, and, thus, has, a, variety, of, names, with, a, variety, of, emphases, these, include, techno, anthropology, digital, ethnography, cyberanthropology, and, virtual, anthropology, ecological, anthropology, is, defined, as, the, study, of, cultural, adaptations, to, environments, the, sub, field, is, also, defined, as, the, study, of, relationships, between, a, population, of, humans, and, their, biophysical, environment, the, focus, of, its, research, concerns, how, cultural, beliefs, and, practices, helped, human, populations, adapt, to, their, environments, and, how, their, environments, change, across, space, and, time, the, contemporary, perspective, of, environmental, anthropology, and, arguably, at, least, the, backdrop, if, not, the, focus, of, most, of, the, ethnographies, and, cultural, fieldworks, of, today, is, political, ecology, many, characterize, this, new, perspective, as, more, informed, with, culture, politics, and, power, globalization, localized, issues, century, anthropology, and, more, the, focus, and, data, interpretation, is, often, used, for, arguments, for, against, or, creation, of, policy, and, to, prevent, corporate, exploitation, and, damage, of, land, often, the, observer, has, become, an, active, part, of, the, struggle, either, directly, organizing, participation, or, indirectly, articles, documentaries, books, ethnographies, such, is, the, case, with, environmental, justice, advocate, melissa, checker, and, her, relationship, with, the, people, of, hyde, park, social, sciences, like, anthropology, can, provide, interdisciplinary, approaches, to, the, environment, professor, kay, milton, director, of, the, anthropology, research, network, in, the, school, of, history, and, anthropology, describes, anthropology, as, distinctive, with, its, most, distinguishing, feature, being, its, interest, in, non, industrial, indigenous, and, traditional, societies, anthropological, theory, is, distinct, because, of, the, consistent, presence, of, the, concept, of, culture, not, an, exclusive, topic, but, a, central, position, in, the, study, and, a, deep, concern, with, the, human, condition, milton, describes, three, trends, that, are, causing, a, fundamental, shift, in, what, characterizes, anthropology, dissatisfaction, with, the, cultural, relativist, perspective, reaction, against, cartesian, dualisms, which, obstructs, progress, in, theory, nature, culture, divide, and, finally, an, increased, attention, to, globalization, transcending, the, barriers, or, time, space, environmental, discourse, appears, to, be, characterized, by, a, high, degree, of, globalization, the, troubling, problem, is, borrowing, non, indigenous, practices, and, creating, standards, concepts, philosophies, and, practices, in, western, countries, anthropology, and, environmental, discourse, now, have, become, a, distinct, position, in, anthropology, as, a, discipline, knowledge, about, diversities, in, human, culture, can, be, important, in, addressing, environmental, problems, anthropology, is, now, a, study, of, human, ecology, human, activity, is, the, most, important, agent, in, creating, environmental, change, a, study, commonly, found, in, human, ecology, which, can, claim, a, central, place, in, how, environmental, problems, are, examined, and, addressed, other, ways, anthropology, contributes, to, environmental, discourse, is, by, being, theorists, and, analysts, or, by, refinement, of, definitions, to, become, more, neutral, universal, etc, in, exploring, environmentalism, the, term, typically, refers, to, a, concern, that, the, environment, should, be, protected, particularly, from, the, harmful, effects, of, human, activities, environmentalism, itself, can, be, expressed, in, many, ways, anthropologists, can, open, the, doors, of, environmentalism, by, looking, beyond, industrial, society, understanding, the, opposition, between, industrial, and, non, industrial, relationships, knowing, what, ecosystem, people, and, biosphere, people, are, and, are, affected, by, dependent, and, independent, variables, primitive, ecological, wisdom, diverse, environments, resource, management, diverse, cultural, traditions, and, knowing, that, environmentalism, is, a, part, of, culture, ethnohistory, is, the, study, of, ethnographic, cultures, and, indigenous, customs, by, examining, historical, records, it, is, also, the, study, of, the, history, of, various, ethnic, groups, that, may, or, may, not, exist, today, ethnohistory, uses, both, historical, and, ethnographic, data, as, its, foundation, its, historical, methods, and, materials, go, beyond, the, standard, use, of, documents, and, manuscripts, practitioners, recognize, the, utility, of, such, source, material, as, maps, music, paintings, photography, folklore, oral, tradition, site, exploration, archaeological, materials, museum, collections, enduring, customs, language, and, place, names, the, anthropology, of, religion, involves, the, study, of, religious, institutions, in, relation, to, other, social, institutions, and, the, comparison, of, religious, beliefs, and, practices, across, cultures, modern, anthropology, assumes, that, there, is, complete, continuity, between, magical, thinking, and, religion, and, that, every, religion, is, a, cultural, product, created, by, the, human, community, that, worships, it, urban, anthropology, is, concerned, with, issues, of, urbanization, poverty, and, neoliberalism, ulf, hannerz, quotes, a, 1960s, remark, that, traditional, anthropologists, were, a, notoriously, agoraphobic, lot, anti, urban, by, definition, various, social, processes, in, the, western, world, as, well, as, in, the, third, world, the, latter, being, the, habitual, focus, of, attention, of, anthropologists, brought, the, attention, of, specialists, in, other, cultures, closer, to, their, homes, there, are, two, main, approaches, to, urban, anthropology, examining, the, types, of, cities, or, examining, the, social, issues, within, the, cities, these, two, methods, are, overlapping, and, dependent, of, each, other, by, defining, different, types, of, cities, one, would, use, social, factors, as, well, as, economic, and, political, factors, to, categorize, the, cities, by, directly, looking, at, the, different, social, issues, one, would, also, be, studying, how, they, affect, the, dynamic, of, the, city, anthrozoology, also, known, as, human, animal, studies, is, the, study, of, interaction, between, living, things, it, is, an, interdisciplinary, field, that, overlaps, with, a, number, of, other, disciplines, including, anthropology, ethology, medicine, psychology, veterinary, medicine, and, zoology, a, major, focus, of, anthrozoologic, research, is, the, quantifying, of, the, positive, effects, of, human, animal, relationships, on, either, party, and, the, study, of, their, interactions, it, includes, scholars, from, a, diverse, range, of, fields, including, anthropology, sociology, biology, and, philosophy, biocultural, anthropology, is, the, scientific, exploration, of, the, relationships, between, human, biology, and, culture, physical, anthropologists, throughout, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, viewed, this, relationship, from, a, racial, perspective, that, is, from, the, assumption, that, typological, human, biological, differences, lead, to, cultural, differences, after, world, war, ii, the, emphasis, began, to, shift, toward, an, effort, to, explore, the, role, culture, plays, in, shaping, human, biology, evolutionary, anthropology, is, the, interdisciplinary, study, of, the, evolution, of, human, physiology, and, human, behaviour, and, the, relation, between, hominins, and, non, hominin, primates, evolutionary, anthropology, is, based, in, natural, science, and, social, science, combining, the, human, development, with, socioeconomic, factors, evolutionary, anthropology, is, concerned, with, both, biological, and, cultural, evolution, of, humans, past, and, present, it, is, based, on, a, scientific, approach, and, brings, together, fields, such, as, archaeology, behavioral, ecology, psychology, primatology, and, genetics, it, is, a, dynamic, and, interdisciplinary, field, drawing, on, many, lines, of, evidence, to, understand, the, human, experience, past, and, present, forensic, anthropology, is, the, application, of, the, science, of, physical, anthropology, and, human, osteology, in, a, legal, setting, most, often, in, criminal, cases, where, the, victim, s, remains, are, in, the, advanced, stages, of, decomposition, a, forensic, anthropologist, can, assist, in, the, identification, of, deceased, individuals, whose, remains, are, decomposed, burned, mutilated, or, otherwise, unrecognizable, the, adjective, forensic, refers, to, the, application, of, this, subfield, of, science, to, a, court, of, law, paleoanthropology, combines, the, disciplines, of, paleontology, and, physical, anthropology, it, is, the, study, of, ancient, humans, as, found, in, fossil, hominid, evidence, such, as, petrifacted, bones, and, footprints, genetics, and, morphology, of, specimens, are, crucially, important, to, this, field, markers, on, specimens, such, as, enamel, fractures, and, dental, decay, on, teeth, can, also, give, insight, into, the, behaviour, and, diet, of, past, populations, contemporary, anthropology, is, an, established, science, with, academic, departments, at, most, universities, and, colleges, the, single, largest, organization, of, anthropologists, is, the, american, anthropological, association, aaa, which, was, founded, in, 1903, its, members, are, anthropologists, from, around, the, globe, in, 1989, a, group, of, european, and, american, scholars, in, the, field, of, anthropology, established, the, european, association, of, social, anthropologists, easa, which, serves, as, a, major, professional, organization, for, anthropologists, working, in, europe, the, easa, seeks, to, advance, the, status, of, anthropology, in, europe, and, to, increase, visibility, of, marginalized, anthropological, traditions, and, thereby, contribute, to, the, project, of, a, global, anthropology, or, world, anthropology, hundreds, of, other, organizations, exist, in, the, various, sub, fields, of, anthropology, sometimes, divided, up, by, nation, or, region, and, many, anthropologists, work, with, collaborators, in, other, disciplines, such, as, geology, physics, zoology, paleontology, anatomy, music, theory, art, history, sociology, and, so, on, belonging, to, professional, societies, in, those, disciplines, as, well, as, the, field, has, matured, it, has, debated, and, arrived, at, ethical, principles, aimed, at, protecting, both, the, subjects, of, anthropological, research, as, well, as, the, researchers, themselves, and, professional, societies, have, generated, codes, of, ethics, anthropologists, like, other, researchers, especially, historians, and, scientists, engaged, in, field, research, have, over, time, assisted, state, policies, and, projects, especially, colonialism, some, commentators, have, contended, as, part, of, their, quest, for, scientific, objectivity, present, day, anthropologists, typically, urge, cultural, relativism, which, has, an, influence, on, all, the, sub, fields, of, anthropology, this, is, the, notion, that, cultures, should, not, be, judged, by, another, s, values, or, viewpoints, but, be, examined, dispassionately, on, their, own, terms, there, should, be, no, notions, in, good, anthropology, of, one, culture, being, better, or, worse, than, another, culture, ethical, commitments, in, anthropology, include, noticing, and, documenting, genocide, infanticide, racism, sexism, mutilation, including, circumcision, and, subincision, and, torture, topics, like, racism, slavery, and, human, sacrifice, attract, anthropological, attention, and, theories, ranging, from, nutritional, deficiencies, to, genes, to, acculturation, to, colonialism, have, been, proposed, to, explain, their, origins, and, continued, recurrences, to, illustrate, the, depth, of, an, anthropological, approach, one, can, take, just, one, of, these, topics, such, as, racism, and, find, thousands, of, anthropological, references, stretching, across, all, the, major, and, minor, sub, fields, anthropologists, involvement, with, the, u, s, government, in, particular, has, caused, bitter, controversy, within, the, discipline, franz, boas, publicly, objected, to, us, participation, in, world, war, i, and, after, the, war, he, published, a, brief, expos, and, condemnation, of, the, participation, of, several, american, archaeologists, in, espionage, in, mexico, under, their, cover, as, scientists, but, by, the, 1940s, many, of, boas, anthropologist, contemporaries, were, active, in, the, allied, war, effort, against, the, axis, powers, nazi, germany, fascist, italy, and, imperial, japan, many, served, in, the, armed, forces, while, others, worked, in, intelligence, for, example, office, of, strategic, services, and, the, office, of, war, information, at, the, same, time, david, h, price, s, work, on, american, anthropology, during, the, cold, war, provides, detailed, accounts, of, the, pursuit, and, dismissal, of, several, anthropologists, from, their, jobs, for, communist, sympathies, attempts, to, accuse, anthropologists, of, complicity, with, the, cia, and, government, intelligence, activities, during, the, vietnam, war, years, have, turned, up, little, many, anthropologists, students, and, teachers, were, active, in, the, antiwar, movement, numerous, resolutions, condemning, the, war, in, all, its, aspects, were, passed, overwhelmingly, at, the, annual, meetings, of, the, american, anthropological, association, aaa, professional, anthropological, bodies, often, object, to, the, use, of, anthropology, for, the, benefit, of, the, state, their, codes, of, ethics, or, statements, may, proscribe, anthropologists, from, giving, secret, briefings, the, association, of, social, anthropologists, of, the, uk, and, commonwealth, asa, has, called, certain, scholarship, ethically, dangerous, the, principles, of, professional, responsibility, issued, by, the, american, anthropological, association, and, amended, through, november, 1986, stated, that, in, relation, with, their, own, government, and, with, host, governments, no, secret, research, no, secret, reports, or, debriefings, of, any, kind, should, be, agreed, to, or, given, the, current, principles, of, professional, responsibility, does, not, make, explicit, mention, of, ethics, surrounding, state, interactions, anthropologists, along, with, other, social, scientists,

grasping, and, meeting, local, needs, in, afghanistan, under, the, human, terrain, system, hts, program, in, addition, hts, teams, are, working, with, the, us, military, in, iraq, in, 2009, the, american, anthropological, association, s, commission, on, the, engagement, of, anthropology, with, the, us, security, and, intelligence, communities, ceaussic, released, its, final, report, concluding, in, part, that, when, ethnographic, investigation, is, determined, by, military, missions, not, subject, to, external, review, where, data, collection, occurs, in, the, context, of, war, integrated, into, the, goals, of, counterinsurgency, and, in, a, potentially, coercive, environment, all, characteristic, factors, of, the, hts, concept, and, its, application, it, can, no, longer, be, considered, a, legitimate, professional, exercise, of, anthropology, in, summary, while, we, stress, that, constructive, engagement, between, anthropology, and, the, military, is, possible, ceaussic, suggests, that, the, aaa, emphasize, the, incompatibility, of, hts, with, disciplinary, ethics, and, practice, for, job, seekers, and, that, it, further, recognize, the, problem, of, allowing, hts, to, define, the, meaning, of, anthropology, within, dod, before, wwii, british, social, anthropology, and, american, cultural, anthropology, were, still, distinct, traditions, after, the, war, enough, british, and, american, anthropologists, borrowed, ideas, and, methodological, approaches, from, one, another, that, some, began, to, speak, of, them, collectively, as, sociocultural, anthropology, there, are, several, characteristics, that, tend, to, unite, anthropological, work, one, of, the, central, characteristics, is, that, anthropology, tends, to, provide, a, comparatively, more, holistic, account, of, phenomena, and, tends, to, be, highly, empirical, the, quest, for, holism, leads, most, anthropologists, to, study, a, particular, place, problem, or, phenomenon, in, detail, using, a, variety, of, methods, over, a, more, extensive, period, than, normal, in, many, parts, of, academia, in, the, 1990s, and, 2000s, calls, for, clarification, of, what, constitutes, a, culture, of, how, an, observer, knows, where, his, or, her, own, culture, ends, and, another, begins, and, other, crucial, topics, in, writing, anthropology, were, heard, these, dynamic, relationships, between, what, can, be, observed, on, the, ground, as, opposed, to, what, can, be, observed, by, compiling, many, local, observations, remain, fundamental, in, any, kind, of, anthropology, whether, cultural, biological, linguistic, or, archaeological, biological, anthropologists, are, interested, in, both, human, variation, and, in, the, possibility, of, human, universals, behaviors, ideas, or, concepts, shared, by, virtually, all, human, cultures, they, use, many, different, methods, of, study, but, modern, population, genetics, participant, observation, and, other, techniques, often, take, anthropologists, into, the, field, which, means, traveling, to, a, community, in, its, own, setting, to, do, something, called, fieldwork, on, the, biological, or, physical, side, human, measurements, genetic, samples, nutritional, data, may, be, gathered, and, published, as, articles, or, monographs, along, with, dividing, up, their, project, by, theoretical, emphasis, anthropologists, typically, divide, the, world, up, into, relevant, time, periods, and, geographic, regions, human, time, on, earth, is, divided, up, into, relevant, cultural, traditions, based, on, material, such, as, the, paleolithic, and, the, neolithic, of, particular, use, in, archaeology, further, cultural, subdivisions, according, to, tool, types, such, as, olduwan, or, mousterian, or, levalloisian, help, archaeologists, and, other, anthropologists, in, understanding, major, trends, in, the, human, past, anthropologists, and, geographers, share, approaches, to, culture, regions, as, well, since, mapping, cultures, is, central, to, both, sciences, by, making, comparisons, across, cultural, traditions, time, based, and, cultural, regions, space, based, anthropologists, have, developed, various, kinds, of, comparative, method, a, central, part, of, their, science, because, anthropology, developed, from, so, many, different, enterprises, see, history, of, anthropology, including, but, not, limited, to, fossil, hunting, exploring, documentary, film, making, paleontology, primatology, antiquity, dealings, and, curatorship, philology, etymology, genetics, regional, analysis, ethnology, history, philosophy, and, religious, studies, it, is, difficult, to, characterize, the, entire, field, in, a, brief, article, although, attempts, to, write, histories, of, the, entire, field, have, been, made, some, authors, argue, that, anthropology, originated, and, developed, as, the, study, of, other, cultures, both, in, terms, of, time, past, societies, and, space, non, european, non, western, societies, for, example, the, classic, of, urban, anthropology, ulf, hannerz, in, the, introduction, to, his, seminal, exploring, the, city, inquiries, toward, an, urban, anthropology, mentions, that, the, third, world, had, habitually, received, most, of, attention, anthropologists, who, traditionally, specialized, in, other, cultures, looked, for, them, far, away, and, started, to, look, across, the, tracks, only, in, late, 1960s, now, there, exist, many, works, focusing, on, peoples, and, topics, very, close, to, the, author, s, home, it, is, also, argued, that, other, fields, of, study, like, history, and, sociology, on, the, contrary, focus, disproportionately, on, the, west, in, france, the, study, of, western, societies, has, been, traditionally, left, to, sociologists, but, this, is, increasingly, changing, starting, in, the, 1970s, from, scholars, like, isac, chiva, and, journals, like, terrain, fieldwork, and, developing, with, the, center,
