the, nilo, saharan, languages, are, a, proposed, family, of, around, 210, african, languages, spoken, by, somewhere, around, 70, million, speakers, mainly, in, the, upper, parts, of, the, chari, and, nile, rivers, including, historic, nubia, north, of, where, the, two, tributaries, of, the, nile, meet, the, languages, extend, through, 17, nations, in, the, northern, half, of, africa, from, algeria, to, benin, in, the, west, from, libya, to, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, in, the, centre, and, from, egypt, to, tanzania, in, the, east, as, indicated, by, its, hyphenated, name, nilo, saharan, is, a, family, of, the, african, interior, including, the, greater, nile, basin, and, the, central, sahara, desert, eight, of, its, proposed, constituent, divisions, excluding, kunama, kuliak, and, songhay, are, found, in, the, modern, countries, of, sudan, and, south, sudan, through, which, the, nile, river, flows, in, his, book, the, languages, of, africa, 1963, joseph, greenberg, named, the, group, and, argued, it, was, a, genetic, family, it, contained, all, the, languages, that, were, not, included, in, the, niger, congo, afroasiatic, or, khoisan, families, although, some, linguists, have, referred, to, the, phylum, as, greenberg, s, wastebasket, into, which, he, placed, all, the, otherwise, unaffiliated, non, click, languages, of, africa, other, specialists, in, the, field, have, accepted, it, as, a, working, hypothesis, since, greenberg, s, classification, linguists, accept, that, it, is, a, challenging, proposal, to, demonstrate, but, contend, that, it, looks, more, promising, the, more, work, is, done, some, of, the, constituent, groups, of, nilo, saharan, are, estimated, to, predate, the, african, neolithic, for, example, the, unity, of, eastern, sudanic, is, estimated, to, date, to, at, least, the, 5th, millennium, bc, nilo, saharan, genetic, unity, would, thus, be, much, older, still, and, date, to, the, late, upper, paleolithic, the, earliest, written, language, associated, with, the, nilo, saharan, family, is, old, nubian, one, of, the, oldest, written, african, languages, attested, in, writing, from, the, 8th, to, the, 15th, century, ad, this, larger, classification, system, is, not, accepted, by, all, linguists, however, glottolog, 2013, for, example, a, publication, of, the, max, planck, institute, in, germany, does, not, recognise, the, unity, of, the, nilo, saharan, family, or, even, of, the, eastern, sudanic, branch, georgiy, starostin, 2016, likewise, does, not, accept, a, relationship, between, the, branches, of, nilo, saharan, though, he, leaves, open, the, possibility, that, some, of, them, may, prove, to, be, related, to, each, other, once, the, necessary, reconstructive, work, is, done, according, to, g, ldemann, 2018, the, current, state, of, research, is, not, sufficient, to, prove, the, nilo, saharan, hypothesis, the, constituent, families, of, nilo, saharan, are, quite, diverse, one, characteristic, feature, is, a, tripartite, singulative, collective, plurative, number, system, which, blench, 2010, believes, is, a, result, of, a, noun, classifier, system, in, the, protolanguage, the, distribution, of, the, families, may, reflect, ancient, watercourses, in, a, green, sahara, during, the, african, humid, period, before, the, 4, 2, kiloyear, event, when, the, desert, was, more, habitable, than, it, is, today, within, the, nilo, saharan, languages, are, a, number, of, languages, with, at, least, a, million, speakers, most, data, from, sil, s, ethnologue, 16, 2009, in, descending, order, some, other, important, nilo, saharan, languages, under, 1, million, speakers, the, total, for, all, speakers, of, nilo, saharan, languages, according, to, ethnologue, 16, is, 38, 39, million, people, however, the, data, spans, a, range, from, ca, 1980, to, 2005, with, a, weighted, median, at, ca, 1990, given, population, growth, rates, the, figure, in, 2010, might, be, half, again, higher, or, about, 60, million, the, saharan, family, which, includes, kanuri, kanembu, the, tebu, languages, and, zaghawa, was, recognized, by, heinrich, barth, in, 1853, the, nilotic, languages, by, karl, richard, lepsius, in, 1880, the, various, constituent, branches, of, central, sudanic, but, not, the, connection, between, them, by, friedrich, m, ller, in, 1889, and, the, maban, family, by, maurice, gaudefroy, demombynes, in, 1907, the, first, inklings, of, a, wider, family, came, in, 1912, when, diedrich, westermann, included, three, of, the, still, independent, central, sudanic, families, within, nilotic, in, a, proposal, he, called, niloto, sudanic, this, expanded, nilotic, was, in, turn, linked, to, nubian, kunama, and, possibly, berta, essentially, greenberg, s, macro, sudanic, chari, nile, proposal, of, 1954, in, 1920, g, w, murray, fleshed, out, the, eastern, sudanic, languages, when, he, grouped, nilotic, nubian, nera, gaam, and, kunama, carlo, conti, rossini, made, similar, proposals, in, 1926, and, in, 1935, westermann, added, murle, in, 1940, a, n, tucker, published, evidence, linking, five, of, the, six, branches, of, central, sudanic, alongside, his, more, explicit, proposal, for, east, sudanic, in, 1950, greenberg, retained, eastern, sudanic, and, central, sudanic, as, separate, families, but, accepted, westermann, s, conclusions, of, four, decades, earlier, in, 1954, when, he, linked, them, together, as, macro, sudanic, later, chari, nile, from, the, chari, and, nile, watersheds, greenberg, s, later, contribution, came, in, 1963, when, he, tied, chari, nile, to, songhai, saharan, maban, fur, and, koman, gumuz, and, coined, the, current, name, nilo, saharan, for, the, resulting, family, lionel, bender, noted, that, chari, nile, was, an, artifact, of, the, order, of, european, contact, with, members, of, the, family, and, did, not, reflect, an, exclusive, relationship, between, these, languages, and, the, group, has, been, abandoned, with, its, constituents, becoming, primary, branches, of, nilo, saharan, or, equivalently, chari, nile, and, nilo, saharan, have, merged, with, the, name, nilo, saharan, retained, when, it, was, realized, that, the, kadu, languages, were, not, niger, congo, they, were, commonly, assumed, to, therefore, be, nilo, saharan, but, this, remains, somewhat, controversial, progress, has, been, made, since, greenberg, established, the, plausibility, of, the, family, koman, and, gumuz, remain, poorly, attested, and, are, difficult, to, work, with, while, arguments, continue, over, the, inclusion, of, songhai, blench, 2010, believes, that, the, distribution, of, nilo, saharan, reflects, the, waterways, of, the, wet, sahara, 12, 000, years, ago, and, that, the, protolanguage, had, noun, classifiers, which, today, are, reflected, in, a, diverse, range, of, prefixes, suffixes, and, number, marking, dimmendaal, 2008, notes, that, greenberg, 1963, based, his, conclusion, on, strong, evidence, and, that, the, proposal, as, a, whole, has, become, more, convincing, in, the, decades, since, mikkola, 1999, reviewed, greenberg, s, evidence, and, found, it, convincing, roger, blench, notes, morphological, similarities, in, all, putative, branches, which, leads, him, to, believe, that, the, family, is, likely, to, be, valid, koman, and, gumuz, are, poorly, known, and, have, been, difficult, to, evaluate, until, recently, songhay, is, markedly, divergent, in, part, due, to, massive, influence, from, the, mande, languages, also, problematic, are, the, kuliak, languages, which, are, spoken, by, hunter, gatherers, and, appear, to, retain, a, non, nilo, saharan, core, blench, believes, they, might, have, been, similar, to, hadza, or, dahalo, and, shifted, incompletely, to, nilo, saharan, anbessa, tefera, and, peter, unseth, consider, the, poorly, attested, shabo, language, to, be, nilo, saharan, though, unclassified, within, the, family, due, to, lack, of, data, dimmendaal, and, blench, based, on, a, more, complete, description, consider, it, to, be, a, language, isolate, on, current, evidence, proposals, have, sometimes, been, made, to, add, mande, usually, included, in, niger, congo, largely, due, to, its, many, noteworthy, similarities, with, songhay, rather, than, with, nilo, saharan, as, a, whole, however, this, relationship, is, more, likely, due, to, a, close, relationship, between, songhay, and, mande, many, thousands, of, years, ago, in, the, early, days, of, nilo, saharan, so, the, relationship, is, probably, more, one, of, ancient, contact, than, a, genetic, link, the, extinct, meroitic, language, of, ancient, kush, has, been, accepted, by, linguists, such, as, rille, dimmendaal, and, blench, as, nilo, saharan, though, others, argue, for, an, afroasiatic, affiliation, it, is, poorly, attested, there, is, little, doubt, that, the, constituent, families, of, nilo, saharan, of, which, only, eastern, sudanic, and, central, sudanic, show, much, internal, diversity, are, valid, groups, however, there, have, been, several, conflicting, classifications, in, grouping, them, together, each, of, the, proposed, higher, order, groups, has, been, rejected, by, other, researchers, greenberg, s, chari, nile, by, bender, and, blench, and, bender, s, core, nilo, saharan, by, dimmendaal, and, blench, what, remains, are, eight, dimmendaal, to, twelve, bender, constituent, families, of, no, consensus, arrangement, joseph, greenberg, in, the, languages, of, africa, set, up, the, family, with, the, following, branches, the, chari, nile, core, are, the, connections, that, had, been, suggested, by, previous, researchers, koman, including, gumuz, saharan, songhay, fur, maban, central, sudanic, kunama, berta, eastern, sudanic, including, kuliak, nubian, and, nilotic, gumuz, was, not, recognized, as, distinct, from, neighbouring, koman, it, was, separated, out, forming, komuz, by, bender, 1989, lionel, bender, came, up, with, a, classification, which, expanded, upon, and, revised, that, of, greenberg, he, considered, fur, and, maban, to, constitute, a, fur, maban, branch, added, kadu, to, nilo, saharan, removed, kuliak, from, eastern, sudanic, removed, gumuz, from, koman, but, left, it, as, a, sister, node, and, chose, to, posit, kunama, as, an, independent, branch, of, the, family, by, 1991, he, had, added, more, detail, to, the, tree, dividing, chari, nile, into, nested, clades, including, a, core, group, in, which, berta, was, considered, divergent, and, coordinating, fur, maban, as, a, sister, clade, to, chari, nile, songhay, saharan, kunama, ilit, kuliak, fur, maban, moru, mangbetu, sara, bongo, berta, surmic, nilotic, nubian, nara, taman, gumuz, koman, including, shabo, kadugli, krongo, bender, revised, his, model, of, nilo, saharan, again, in, 1996, at, which, point, he, split, koman, and, gumuz, into, completely, separate, branches, of, core, nilo, saharan, christopher, ehret, came, up, with, a, novel, classification, of, nilo, saharan, as, a, preliminary, part, of, his, then, ongoing, research, into, the, macrofamily, his, evidence, for, the, classification, was, not, fully, published, until, much, later, see, ehret, 2001, below, and, so, it, did, not, attain, the, same, level, of, acclaim, as, competing, proposals, namely, those, of, bender, and, blench, by, 2000, bender, had, entirely, abandoned, the, chari, nile, and, komuz, branches, he, also, added, kunama, back, to, the, satellite, core, group, and, simplified, the, subdivisions, therein, he, retracted, the, inclusion, of, shabo, stating, that, it, could, not, yet, be, adequately, classified, but, might, prove, to, be, nilo, saharan, once, sufficient, research, has, been, done, this, tentative, and, somewhat, conservative, classification, held, as, a, sort, of, standard, for, the, next, decade, songhay, saharan, kuliak, maban, fur, central, sudanic, berta, kunama, eastern, sudanic, koman, gumuz, kadu, ehret, s, updated, classification, was, published, in, his, book, a, historical, comparative, reconstruction, of, nilo, saharan, 2001, this, model, is, notable, in, that, it, consists, of, two, primary, branches, gumuz, koman, and, a, sudanic, group, containing, the, rest, of, the, families, see, sudanic, languages, nilo, saharan, for, more, detail, also, unusually, songhay, is, well, nested, within, a, core, group, and, coordinate, with, maban, in, a, western, sahelian, clade, and, kadu, is, not, included, in, nilo, saharan, note, that, koman, in, this, classification, is, equivalent, to, komuz, i, e, a, family, with, gumuz, and, koman, as, primary, branches, and, ehret, renames, the, traditional, koman, group, as, western, koman, gumuz, western, koman, central, sudanic, kunama, saharan, fur, songhay, maban, eastern, sahelian, eastern, sudanic, including, berta, niger, saharan, a, language, macrofamily, linking, the, niger, congo, and, nilo, saharan, phyla, was, proposed, by, blench, 2006, it, was, not, accepted, by, other, linguists, blench, s, 2006, internal, classification, of, the, niger, saharan, macrophylum, is, as, follows, according, to, blench, 2006, typological, features, common, to, both, niger, congo, and, nilo, saharan, include, with, a, better, understanding, of, nilo, saharan, classifiers, and, the, affixes, or, number, marking, they, have, developed, into, in, various, branches, blench, believes, that, all, of, the, families, postulated, as, nilo, saharan, belong, together, he, proposes, the, following, tentative, internal, classification, with, songhai, closest, to, saharan, a, relationship, that, had, not, previously, been, suggested, kunama, berta, koman, gumuz, saharan, songhay, kuliak, maban, fur, kadu, central, sudanic, eastern, sudanic, mimi, of, decorse, by, 2015, and, again, in, 2017, blench, had, refined, the, subclassification, of, this, model, linking, maban, with, fur, kadu, with, eastern, sudanic, and, kuliak, with, the, node, that, contained, them, and, added, a, tentative, extinct, branch, he, names, plateau, as, to, explain, a, possible, nilo, saharan, substrate, in, the, malian, dogon, and, bangime, languages, for, the, following, structure, berta, koman, gumuz, kunama, saharan, songhay, plateau, kuliak, maban, fur, central, sudanic, kadu, eastern, sudanic, blench, 2021, concludes, that, maban, may, be, close, to, eastern, sudanic, georgiy, starostin, 2016, using, lexicostatistics, based, on, swadesh, lists, is, more, inclusive, than, glottolog, and, in, addition, finds, probable, and, possible, links, between, the, families, that, will, require, reconstruction, of, the, proto, languages, for, confirmation, starostin, also, does, not, consider, greenberg, s, nilo, saharan, to, be, a, valid, coherent, clade, in, addition, to, the, families, listed, in, glottolog, previous, section, starostin, considers, the, following, to, be, established, a, relationship, of, nyima, with, nubian, nara, and, tama, nnt, is, considered, highly, likely, and, close, enough, that, proper, comparative, work, should, be, able, to, demonstrate, the, connection, if, it, s, valid, though, it, would, fall, outside, nnt, proper, see, eastern, sudanic, languages, other, units, that, are, highly, likely, to, eventually, prove, to, be, valid, families, are, in, summary, at, this, level, of, certainty, nilo, saharan, constitutes, ten, distinct, and, separate, language, families, eastern, sudanic, central, sudanic, kadu, maba, kunama, komuz, saharan, songhai, kuliak, fur, berta, and, shabo, possible, further, deep, connections, which, cannot, be, evaluated, until, the, proper, comparative, work, on, the, constituent, branches, has, been, completed, are, there, are, faint, suggestions, that, eastern, and, central, sudanic, may, be, related, essentially, the, old, chari, nile, clade, though, that, possibility, is, unexplorable, under, current, conditions, and, could, be, complicated, if, niger, congo, were, added, to, the, comparison, starostin, finds, no, evidence, that, the, komuz, kuliak, saharan, songhai, or, shabo, languages, are, related, to, any, of, the, other, nilo, saharan, languages, mimi, d, and, meroitic, were, not, considered, though, starostin, had, previously, proposed, that, mimi, d, was, also, an, isolate, despite, its, slight, similarity, to, central, sudanic, in, a, follow, up, study, published, in, 2017, starostin, reiterated, his, previous, points, as, well, as, explicitly, accepting, a, genetic, relationship, between, macro, east, sudanic, and, macro, central, sudanic, starostin, names, this, proposal, macro, sudanic, the, classification, is, as, follows, starostin, 2017, finds, significant, lexical, similarities, between, kadu, and, central, sudanic, while, some, lexical, similarities, also, shared, by, central, sudanic, with, fur, amdang, berta, and, eastern, sudanic, to, a, lesser, extent, gerrit, j, dimmendaal, suggests, the, following, subclassification, of, nilo, saharan, maban, kunama, fur, saharan, eastern, sudanic, including, berta, kuliak, central, sudanic, dimmendaal, et, al, consider, the, evidence, for, the, inclusion, of, kadu, and, songhay, too, weak, to, draw, any, conclusions, at, present, whereas, there, is, some, evidence, that, koman, and, gumuz, belong, together, and, may, be, nilo, saharan, the, large, northeastern, division, is, based, on, several, typological, markers, by, 2023, blench, had, slightly, revised, the, model, for, a, deep, primary, split, between, koman, gumuz, and, the, rest, kunama, and, berta, are, provisionally, placed, as, the, next, to, branch, off, because, they, only, partially, share, the, features, that, unite, the, rest, of, the, family, however, it, is, not, clear, if, this, is, because, they, actually, diverged, early, or, if, they, might, have, lost, those, features, at, a, later, date, for, example, berta, shares, plausible, lexical, cognates, with, the, eastern, jebel, languages, east, sudanic, and, its, system, of, grammatical, number, closely, resembles, those, of, the, east, sudanic, languages, kunama, could, be, divergent, due, to, long, term, interaction, with, afroasiatic, languages, saharan, songhay, especially, songhay, have, seen, substantial, erosion, of, key, characteristics, but, this, appears, to, be, a, secondary, development, and, not, evidence, of, early, branching, core, nilo, saharan, central, african, in, blench, 2015, thus, appears, to, be, a, typological, rather, than, genetic, grouping, though, maban, is, treated, as, a, divergent, branch, of, eastern, sudanic, kadu, also, seems, to, be, quite, close, the, resulting, structure, is, as, follows, koman, gumuz, saharan, songhay, fur, central, sudanic, kadu, kuliak, maban, eastern, sudanic, berta, kunama, beyond, the, work, of, colleen, ahland, blench, notes, that, the, inclusion, of, koman, is, buttressed, by, the, work, of, manuel, otero, the, argument, for, songhay, is, mostly, lexical, especially, the, pronouns, blench, gives, greenberg, credit, for, both, east, and, central, sudanic, saharan, and, songhay, have, some, striking, similarities, in, their, lexicon, which, blench, argues, is, genetic, though, the, absence, of, reliable, proto, sarahan, and, proto, songhay, reconstructions, makes, evaluation, difficult, in, summarizing, the, literature, to, date, hammarstr, m, et, al, in, glottolog, do, not, accept, that, the, following, families, are, demonstrably, related, with, current, research, proposals, for, the, external, relationships, of, nilo, saharan, typically, center, on, niger, congo, gregersen, 1972, grouped, the, two, together, as, kongo, saharan, however, blench, 2011, proposed, that, the, similarities, between, niger, congo, and, nilo, saharan, specifically, atlantic, congo, and, central, sudanic, are, due, to, contact, with, the, noun, class, system, of, niger, congo, developed, from, or, elaborated, on, the, model, of, the, noun, classifiers, of, central, sudanic, nilo, saharan, languages, present, great, differences, being, a, highly, diversified, group, it, has, proven, difficult, to, reconstruct, many, aspects, of, proto, nilo, saharan, two, very, different, reconstructions, of, the, proto, language, have, been, proposed, by, lionel, bender, and, christopher, ehret, the, consonant, system, reconstructed, by, bender, for, proto, nilo, saharan, is, the, phonemes, d, t, correspond, to, coronal, plosives, the, phonetic, details, are, difficult, to, specify, but, clearly, they, remain, distinct, from, d, t, and, supported, by, many, phonetic, correspondences, another, author, c, ehret, reconstructs, for, the, coronal, area, the, sound, and, which, perhaps, are, closer, to, the, phonetic, detail, of, d, t, see, infra, bender, gave, a, list, of, about, 350, cognates, and, discussed, in, depth, the, grouping, and, the, phonological, system, proposed, by, ch, ehret, blench, 2000, compares, both, systems, bender, s, and, ehret, s, and, prefers, the, former, because, it, is, more, secure, and, is, based, in, more, reliable, data, for, example, bender, points, out, that, there, is, a, set, of, phonemes, including, implosives, ejectives, p, t, s, c, k, and, prenasal, constants, b, d, t, g, but, it, seems, that, they, can, be, reconstructed, only, for, core, groups, e, i, j, l, and, the, collateral, group, c, d, f, g, h, but, not, for, proto, nilo, saharan, christopher, ehret, used, a, less, clear, methodology, and, proposed, a, maximalist, phonemic, system, ehret, s, maximalist, system, has, been, criticized, by, bender, and, blench, these, authors, state, that, the, correspondences, used, by, ehret, are, not, very, clear, and, because, of, this, many, of, the, sounds, in, the, table, may, only, be, allophonic, variations, dimmendaal, 2016, cites, the, following, morphological, elements, as, stable, across, nilo, saharan, sample, basic, vocabulary, in, different, nilo, saharan, branches, note, in, table, cells, with, slashes, the, singular, form, is, given, before, the, slash, while, the, plural, form, follows, the, slash, in,
