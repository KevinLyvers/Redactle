economic, inequality, is, an, umbrella, term, for, a, income, inequality, or, distribution, of, income, how, the, total, sum, of, money, paid, to, people, is, distributed, among, them, b, wealth, inequality, or, distribution, of, wealth, how, the, total, sum, of, wealth, owned, by, people, is, distributed, among, the, owners, and, c, consumption, inequality, how, the, total, sum, of, money, spent, by, people, is, distributed, among, the, spenders, each, of, these, can, be, measured, between, two, or, more, nations, within, a, single, nation, or, between, and, within, sub, populations, such, as, within, a, low, income, group, within, a, high, income, group, and, between, them, within, an, age, group, and, between, inter, generational, groups, within, a, gender, group, and, between, them, etc, either, from, one, or, from, multiple, nations, income, inequality, metrics, are, used, for, measuring, income, inequality, the, gini, coefficient, being, a, widely, used, one, another, type, of, measurement, is, the, inequality, adjusted, human, development, index, which, is, a, statistic, composite, index, that, takes, inequality, into, account, important, concepts, of, equality, include, equity, equality, of, outcome, and, equality, of, opportunity, historically, there, has, been, a, long, run, trend, towards, greater, economic, inequality, over, time, the, exceptions, to, this, during, the, modern, era, are, the, declines, in, economic, inequality, during, the, two, world, wars, and, amid, the, creation, of, modern, welfare, states, after, world, war, ii, whereas, globalization, has, reduced, the, inequality, between, nations, it, has, increased, the, inequality, within, the, population, in, most, nations, income, inequality, between, nations, peaked, in, the, 1970s, when, world, income, was, distributed, bimodally, into, rich, and, poor, countries, since, then, income, levels, across, countries, have, been, converging, with, most, people, now, living, in, middle, income, countries, however, inequality, within, the, population, in, most, has, risen, significantly, in, the, last, 30, years, particularly, among, advanced, countries, research, has, generally, linked, economic, inequality, to, political, and, social, instability, including, revolution, democratic, breakdown, and, civil, conflict, research, suggests, that, greater, inequality, hinders, economic, growth, and, macroeconomic, stability, and, that, land, and, human, capital, inequality, reduce, growth, more, than, inequality, of, income, inequality, is, at, the, center, stage, of, economic, policy, debate, across, the, globe, as, government, tax, and, spending, policies, have, significant, effects, on, income, distribution, in, advanced, economies, taxes, and, transfers, decrease, income, inequality, by, one, third, with, most, of, this, being, achieved, via, public, social, spending, such, as, pensions, and, family, benefits, while, the, optimum, amount, of, economic, inequality, is, widely, debated, there, is, a, near, universal, belief, that, complete, economic, equality, gini, of, zero, would, be, undesirable, and, unachieveable, 1, in, 1820, the, ratio, between, the, income, of, the, top, and, bottom, 20, percent, of, the, world, s, population, was, three, to, one, by, 1991, it, was, eighty, six, to, one, a, 2011, study, titled, divided, we, stand, why, inequality, keeps, rising, by, the, organisation, for, economic, co, operation, and, development, oecd, sought, to, explain, the, causes, for, this, rising, inequality, by, investigating, economic, inequality, in, oecd, countries, it, concluded, that, the, following, factors, played, a, role, the, study, made, the, following, conclusions, about, the, level, of, economic, inequality, a, 2011, oecd, study, investigated, economic, inequality, in, argentina, brazil, china, india, indonesia, russia, and, south, africa, it, concluded, that, key, sources, of, inequality, in, these, countries, include, a, large, persistent, informal, sector, widespread, regional, divides, e, g, urban, rural, gaps, in, access, to, education, and, barriers, to, employment, and, career, progression, for, women, a, study, by, the, world, institute, for, development, economics, research, at, united, nations, university, reported, that, the, richest, 1, of, adults, alone, owned, 40, of, global, assets, in, the, year, 2000, the, three, richest, people, in, the, world, possess, more, financial, assets, than, the, lowest, 48, nations, combined, the, combined, wealth, of, the, 10, million, dollar, millionaires, grew, to, nearly, 41, trillion, in, 2008, oxfam, s, 2021, report, on, global, inequality, said, that, the, covid, 19, pandemic, has, increased, economic, inequality, substantially, the, wealthiest, people, across, the, globe, were, impacted, the, least, by, the, pandemic, and, their, fortunes, recovered, quickest, with, billionaires, seeing, their, wealth, increase, by, 3, 9, trillion, while, at, the, same, time, the, number, of, people, living, on, less, than, 5, 50, a, day, likely, increased, by, 500, million, according, to, economist, joseph, stiglitz, the, pandemic, s, most, significant, outcome, will, be, rising, economic, inequality, in, the, united, states, and, between, the, developed, and, developing, world, the, 2024, oxfam, report, found, a, significant, increase, in, inequality, as, roughly, five, billion, people, have, become, poorer, while, at, the, same, time, the, fortunes, of, the, five, richest, individuals, have, doubled, the, report, warns, that, current, trends, are, paving, the, way, for, the, world, s, first, trillionaire, within, a, decade, and, global, poverty, eradication, being, postponed, for, 229, years, according, to, politifact, the, top, 400, richest, americans, have, more, wealth, than, half, of, all, americans, combined, according, to, the, new, york, times, on, july, 22, 2014, the, richest, 1, percent, in, the, united, states, now, own, more, wealth, than, the, bottom, 90, percent, inherited, wealth, may, help, explain, why, many, americans, who, have, become, rich, may, have, had, a, substantial, head, start, a, 2017, report, by, the, ips, said, that, three, individuals, jeff, bezos, bill, gates, and, warren, buffett, own, as, much, wealth, as, the, bottom, half, of, the, population, or, 160, million, people, and, that, the, growing, disparity, between, the, wealthy, and, the, poor, has, created, a, moral, crisis, noting, that, we, have, not, witnessed, such, extreme, levels, of, concentrated, wealth, and, power, since, the, first, gilded, age, a, century, ago, in, 2016, the, world, s, billionaires, increased, their, combined, global, wealth, to, a, record, 6, trillion, in, 2017, they, increased, their, collective, wealth, to, 8, 9, trillion, in, 2018, u, s, income, inequality, reached, the, highest, level, ever, recorded, by, the, census, bureau, the, existing, data, and, estimates, suggest, a, large, increase, in, international, and, more, generally, inter, macroregional, components, between, 1820, and, 1960, it, might, have, slightly, decreased, since, that, time, at, the, expense, of, increasing, inequality, within, countries, the, united, nations, development, programme, in, 2014, asserted, that, greater, investments, in, social, security, jobs, and, laws, that, protect, vulnerable, populations, are, necessary, to, prevent, widening, income, inequality, there, is, a, significant, difference, in, the, measured, wealth, distribution, and, the, public, s, understanding, of, wealth, distribution, michael, norton, of, the, harvard, business, school, and, dan, ariely, of, the, department, of, psychology, at, duke, university, found, this, to, be, true, in, their, research, conducted, in, 2011, the, actual, wealth, going, to, the, top, quintile, in, 2011, was, around, 84, whereas, the, average, amount, of, wealth, that, the, general, public, estimated, to, go, to, the, top, quintile, was, around, 58, according, to, a, 2020, study, global, earnings, inequality, has, decreased, substantially, since, 1970, during, the, 2000s, and, 2010s, the, share, of, earnings, by, the, world, s, poorest, half, doubled, two, researchers, claim, that, global, income, inequality, is, decreasing, due, to, strong, economic, growth, in, developing, countries, according, to, a, january, 2020, report, by, the, united, nations, department, of, economic, and, social, affairs, economic, inequality, between, states, had, declined, but, intrastate, inequality, has, increased, for, 70, of, the, world, population, over, the, period, 1990, 2015, in, 2015, the, oecd, reported, in, 2015, that, income, inequality, is, higher, than, it, has, ever, been, within, oecd, member, nations, and, is, at, increased, levels, in, many, emerging, economies, according, to, a, june, 2015, report, by, the, international, monetary, fund, imf, widening, income, inequality, is, the, defining, challenge, of, our, time, in, advanced, economies, the, gap, between, the, rich, and, poor, is, at, its, highest, level, in, decades, inequality, trends, have, been, more, mixed, in, emerging, markets, and, developing, countries, emdcs, with, some, countries, experiencing, declining, inequality, but, pervasive, inequities, in, access, to, education, health, care, and, finance, remain, in, october, 2017, the, imf, warned, that, inequality, within, nations, in, spite, of, global, inequality, falling, in, recent, decades, has, risen, so, sharply, that, it, threatens, economic, growth, and, could, result, in, further, political, polarization, the, fund, s, fiscal, monitor, report, said, that, progressive, taxation, and, transfers, are, key, components, of, efficient, fiscal, redistribution, in, october, 2018, oxfam, published, a, reducing, inequality, index, which, measured, social, spending, tax, and, workers, rights, to, show, which, countries, were, best, at, closing, the, gap, between, the, rich, and, the, poor, the, 2022, world, inequality, report, a, four, year, research, project, organized, by, the, economists, lucas, chancel, thomas, piketty, emmanuel, saez, and, gabriel, zucman, shows, that, the, world, is, marked, by, a, very, high, level, of, income, inequality, and, an, extreme, level, of, wealth, inequality, and, that, these, inequalities, seem, to, be, about, as, great, today, as, they, were, at, the, peak, of, western, imperialism, in, the, early, 20th, century, according, to, the, report, the, bottom, half, of, the, population, owns, 2, of, global, wealth, while, the, top, 10, owns, 76, of, it, the, top, 1, owns, 38, the, wealth, is, calculated, by, various, factors, for, instance, liabilities, debts, exchange, rates, and, their, expected, development, real, estate, prices, human, resources, natural, resources, and, technical, advancements, etc, income, inequality, is, measured, by, gini, coefficient, expressed, in, percent, that, is, a, number, between, 0, and, 1, here, 0, expresses, perfect, equality, meaning, that, everyone, has, the, same, income, whereas, 1, represents, perfect, inequality, meaning, that, one, person, has, all, the, income, and, others, have, none, a, gini, index, value, above, 50, is, considered, high, countries, including, brazil, colombia, south, africa, botswana, and, honduras, can, be, found, in, this, category, a, gini, index, value, of, 30, or, above, is, considered, medium, countries, including, vietnam, mexico, poland, the, united, states, argentina, russia, and, uruguay, can, be, found, in, this, category, a, gini, index, value, lower, than, 30, is, considered, low, countries, including, austria, germany, denmark, norway, slovenia, sweden, and, ukraine, can, be, found, in, this, category, in, the, low, income, inequality, category, below, 30, is, a, wide, representation, of, countries, previously, being, part, of, soviet, union, or, its, satellites, like, slovakia, czech, republic, ukraine, and, hungary, in, 2012, the, gini, index, for, income, inequality, for, whole, european, union, was, only, 30, 6, income, distribution, can, differ, from, wealth, distribution, within, each, country, the, wealth, inequality, is, also, measured, in, gini, index, there, the, higher, gini, index, signify, greater, inequality, within, the, wealth, distribution, in, country, 0, means, total, wealth, equality, and, 1, represents, situation, where, everyone, has, no, wealth, except, an, individual, that, has, everything, for, instance, countries, like, denmark, norway, and, netherlands, all, belonging, to, the, last, category, below, 30, low, income, inequality, also, have, very, high, gini, index, in, wealth, distribution, ranging, from, 70, up, to, 90, in, economics, the, consumption, distribution, or, consumption, inequality, is, an, alternative, to, the, income, distribution, or, wealth, distribution, for, judging, economic, inequality, comparing, levels, of, consumption, rather, than, income, or, wealth, this, is, an, important, measure, of, inequality, as, the, basic, utility, of, the, wealth, or, income, is, the, expenditure, people, experience, the, inequality, directly, in, consumption, rather, than, income, or, wealth, there, are, various, reasons, for, economic, inequality, within, societies, including, both, global, market, functions, such, as, trade, development, and, regulation, as, well, as, social, factors, including, gender, race, and, education, recent, growth, in, overall, income, inequality, at, least, within, the, oecd, countries, has, been, driven, mostly, by, increasing, inequality, in, wages, and, salaries, economist, thomas, piketty, argues, that, widening, economic, disparity, is, an, inevitable, phenomenon, of, free, market, capitalism, when, the, rate, of, return, of, capital, r, is, greater, than, the, rate, of, growth, of, the, economy, g, according, to, an, imf, report, in, 2016, after, reviewing, four, decades, of, neoliberalism, it, had, warned, that, certain, neoliberal, policies, including, privatization, public, spending, cuts, and, deregulation, have, resulted, in, increased, inequality, and, are, stunting, economic, growth, globally, in, modern, market, economies, if, competition, is, imperfect, information, unevenly, distributed, opportunities, to, acquire, education, and, skills, unequal, market, failure, results, many, such, imperfect, conditions, exist, in, virtually, every, market, according, to, joseph, stiglitz, this, means, that, there, is, an, enormous, potential, role, for, government, to, correct, such, market, failures, in, the, united, states, real, wages, are, flat, over, the, past, 40, years, for, occupations, across, income, and, education, levels, e, g, auto, mechanics, cashiers, doctors, and, software, engineers, however, stock, ownership, favors, higher, income, and, education, levels, thereby, resulting, in, disparate, investment, income, another, cause, is, the, rate, at, which, income, is, taxed, coupled, with, the, progressivity, of, the, tax, system, a, progressive, tax, is, a, tax, by, which, the, tax, rate, increases, as, the, taxable, base, amount, increases, in, a, progressive, tax, system, the, level, of, the, top, tax, rate, will, often, have, a, direct, impact, on, the, level, of, inequality, within, a, society, either, increasing, it, or, decreasing, it, provided, that, income, does, not, change, as, a, result, of, the, change, in, tax, regime, additionally, steeper, tax, progressivity, applied, to, social, spending, can, result, in, a, more, equal, distribution, of, income, across, the, board, tax, credits, such, as, the, earned, income, tax, credit, in, the, us, can, also, decrease, income, inequality, the, difference, between, the, gini, index, for, an, income, distribution, before, taxation, and, the, gini, index, after, taxation, is, an, indicator, for, the, effects, of, such, taxation, an, important, factor, in, the, creation, of, inequality, is, variation, in, individuals, access, to, education, education, especially, in, an, area, where, there, is, a, high, demand, for, workers, creates, high, wages, for, those, with, this, education, however, increases, in, education, first, increase, and, then, decrease, growth, as, well, as, income, inequality, as, a, result, those, who, are, unable, to, afford, an, education, or, choose, not, to, pursue, optional, education, generally, receive, much, lower, wages, the, justification, for, this, is, that, a, lack, of, education, leads, directly, to, lower, incomes, and, thus, lower, aggregate, saving, and, investment, conversely, quality, education, raises, incomes, and, promotes, growth, because, it, helps, to, unleash, the, productive, potential, of, the, poor, access, to, education, was, in, turn, influenced, by, land, inequalities, in, the, less, industrialized, parts, of, 19th, century, europe, for, example, landowners, still, held, more, political, power, than, industrialists, these, landowners, did, not, benefit, from, educating, their, workers, as, much, as, industrialists, did, since, educated, workers, have, more, incentives, to, migrate, to, urban, industrial, areas, than, their, less, educated, counterparts, consequently, lower, incentives, to, promote, education, in, regions, where, land, inequality, was, high, led, to, lower, levels, of, numeracy, in, these, regions, john, schmitt, and, ben, zipperer, 2006, of, the, cepr, point, to, economic, liberalism, and, the, reduction, of, business, regulation, along, with, the, decline, of, union, membership, as, one, of, the, causes, of, economic, inequality, in, an, analysis, of, the, effects, of, intensive, anglo, american, liberal, policies, in, comparison, to, continental, european, liberalism, where, unions, have, remained, strong, they, concluded, the, u, s, economic, and, social, model, is, associated, with, substantial, levels, of, social, exclusion, including, high, levels, of, income, inequality, high, relative, and, absolute, poverty, rates, poor, and, unequal, educational, outcomes, poor, health, outcomes, and, high, rates, of, crime, and, incarceration, at, the, same, time, the, available, evidence, provides, little, support, for, the, view, that, u, s, style, labor, market, flexibility, dramatically, improves, labor, market, outcomes, despite, popular, prejudices, to, the, contrary, the, u, s, economy, consistently, affords, a, lower, level, of, economic, mobility, than, all, the, continental, european, countries, for, which, data, is, available, more, recently, the, international, monetary, fund, has, published, studies, which, found, that, the, decline, of, unionization, in, many, advanced, economies, and, the, establishment, of, neoliberal, economics, have, fueled, rising, income, inequality, contrary, to, the, proponents, of, neoliberalism, trickle, down, economics, have, been, proven, to, not, be, effective, in, resolving, economic, inequalities, but, have, instead, worsened, it, the, growth, in, importance, of, information, technology, has, been, credited, with, increasing, income, inequality, technology, has, been, called, the, main, driver, of, the, recent, increases, in, inequality, by, erik, brynjolfsson, of, mit, in, arguing, against, this, explanation, jonathan, rothwell, notes, that, if, technological, advancement, is, measured, by, high, rates, of, invention, there, is, a, negative, correlation, between, it, and, inequality, countries, with, high, invention, rates, as, measured, by, patent, applications, filed, under, the, patent, cooperation, treaty, exhibit, lower, inequality, than, those, with, less, in, one, country, the, united, states, salaries, of, engineers, and, software, developers, rarely, reach, above, 390, 000, year, the, lower, limit, for, the, top, 1, earners, some, researchers, such, as, juliet, b, schor, highlight, the, role, of, for, profit, online, sharing, economy, platforms, as, an, accelerator, of, income, inequality, and, calls, into, question, their, supposed, contribution, in, empowering, outsiders, of, the, labour, market, taking, the, example, of, taskrabbit, a, labour, service, platform, she, shows, that, a, large, proportion, of, providers, already, have, a, stable, full, time, job, and, participate, part, time, in, the, platform, as, an, opportunity, to, increase, their, income, by, diversifying, their, activities, outside, employment, which, tends, to, restrict, the, volume, of, work, remaining, for, the, minority, of, platform, workers, in, addition, there, is, an, important, phenomenon, of, labour, substitution, as, manual, tasks, traditionally, performed, by, workers, without, a, degree, or, just, a, college, degree, integrated, into, the, labour, market, in, the, traditional, economy, sectors, are, now, performed, by, workers, with, a, high, level, of, education, in, 2013, 70, of, taskrabbit, s, workforce, held, a, bachelor, s, degree, 20, a, master, s, degree, and, 5, a, phd, the, development, of, platforms, which, are, increasingly, capturing, demand, for, these, manual, services, at, the, expense, of, non, platform, companies, may, therefore, benefit, mainly, skilled, workers, who, are, offered, more, earning, opportunities, that, can, be, used, as, supplemental, or, transitional, work, during, periods, of, unemployment, it, has, also, been, proposed, that, information, technologies, contribute, to, winner, take, most, market, concentration, reducing, the, need, for, labor, across, competing, suppliers, market, concentration, drives, down, labor, s, share, of, the, gdp, increasing, the, wealth, of, capital, and, thereby, exacerbating, inequality, economists, have, linked, automation, to, increases, in, economic, inequality, as, automation, raises, the, returns, to, wealth, and, contributes, to, stagnating, wages, at, the, lower, end, of, the, wage, distribution, several, economists, have, suggested, that, automation, has, increased, income, inequality, by, causing, low, skill, jobs, to, be, replaced, with, machines, operated, by, technologically, skilled, workers, thereby, reducing, the, demand, for, unskilled, labor, while, increasing, the, demand, for, skilled, labor, 1, trade, liberalization, may, shift, economic, inequality, from, a, global, to, a, domestic, scale, when, rich, countries, trade, with, poor, countries, the, low, skilled, workers, in, the, rich, countries, may, see, reduced, wages, as, a, result, of, the, competition, while, low, skilled, workers, in, the, poor, countries, may, see, increased, wages, trade, economist, paul, krugman, estimates, that, trade, liberalisation, has, had, a, measurable, effect, on, the, rising, inequality, in, the, united, states, he, attributes, this, trend, to, increased, trade, with, poor, countries, and, the, fragmentation, of, the, means, of, production, resulting, in, low, skilled, jobs, becoming, more, tradeable, anthropologist, jason, hickel, contends, that, globalization, and, structural, adjustment, set, off, the, race, to, the, bottom, a, significant, driver, of, surging, global, inequality, another, driver, hickel, mentions, is, the, debt, system, which, advanced, the, need, for, structural, adjustment, in, the, first, place, in, many, countries, there, is, a, gender, pay, gap, in, favor, of, males, in, the, labor, market, several, factors, other, than, discrimination, contribute, to, this, gap, on, average, women, are, more, likely, than, men, to, consider, factors, other, than, pay, when, looking, for, work, and, may, be, less, willing, to, travel, or, relocate, thomas, sowell, in, his, book, knowledge, and, decisions, claims, that, this, difference, is, due, to, women, not, taking, jobs, due, to, marriage, or, pregnancy, a, u, s, census, s, report, stated, that, in, us, once, other, factors, are, accounted, for, there, is, still, a, difference, in, earnings, between, women, and, men, a, study, done, on, three, post, soviet, countries, armenia, georgia, and, azerbaijan, reveals, that, gender, is, one, of, the, driving, forces, of, income, inequality, and, being, female, has, a, significant, negative, effect, on, income, when, other, factors, are, held, equal, the, results, show, more, than, 50, gender, pay, gap, in, all, three, countries, these, findings, are, because, usually, employers, tend, to, avoid, hiring, women, because, of, possible, maternity, leave, other, reason, for, this, can, be, occupational, segregation, which, implies, that, women, are, usually, accumulated, in, lower, paid, positions, and, sectors, such, as, social, services, and, education, there, is, also, a, globally, recognized, disparity, in, the, wealth, income, and, economic, welfare, of, people, of, different, races, in, many, nations, data, exists, to, suggest, that, members, of, certain, racial, demographics, experience, lower, wages, fewer, opportunities, for, career, and, educational, advancement, and, intergenerational, wealth, gaps, studies, have, uncovered, the, emergence, of, what, is, called, ethnic, capital, by, which, people, belonging, to, a, race, that, has, experienced, discrimination, are, born, into, a, disadvantaged, family, from, the, beginning, and, therefore, have, less, resources, and, opportunities, at, their, disposal, the, universal, lack, of, education, technical, and, cognitive, skills, and, inheritable, wealth, within, a, particular, race, is, often, passed, down, between, generations, compounding, in, effect, to, make, escaping, these, racialized, cycles, of, poverty, increasingly, difficult, additionally, ethnic, groups, that, experience, significant, disparities, are, often, also, minorities, at, least, in, representation, though, often, in, number, as, well, in, the, nations, where, they, experience, the, harshest, disadvantage, as, a, result, they, are, often, segregated, either, by, government, policy, or, social, stratification, leading, to, ethnic, communities, that, experience, widespread, gaps, in, wealth, and, aid, redlining, intentionally, excluded, black, americans, from, accumulating, intergenerational, wealth, the, effects, of, this, exclusion, on, black, americans, health, continue, to, play, out, daily, generations, later, in, the, same, communities, this, is, evident, currently, in, the, disproportionate, effects, that, covid, 19, has, had, on, the, same, communities, which, the, holc, redlined, in, the, 1930s, research, published, in, september, 2020, overlaid, maps, of, the, highly, affected, covid, 19, areas, with, the, holc, maps, showing, that, those, areas, marked, risky, to, lenders, because, they, contained, minority, residents, were, the, same, neighborhoods, most, affected, by, covid, 19, the, centers, for, disease, control, cdc, looks, at, inequities, in, the, social, determinants, of, health, like, concentrated, poverty, and, healthcare, access, that, are, interrelated, and, influence, health, outcomes, with, regard, to, covid, 19, as, well, as, quality, of, life, in, general, for, minority, groups, the, cdc, points, to, discrimination, within, health, care, education, criminal, justice, housing, and, finance, direct, results, of, systematically, subversive, tactics, like, redlining, which, led, to, chronic, and, toxic, stress, that, shaped, social, and, economic, factors, for, minority, groups, increasing, their, risk, for, covid, 19, healthcare, access, is, similarly, limited, by, factors, like, a, lack, of, public, transportation, child, care, and, communication, and, language, barriers, which, result, from, the, spatial, and, economic, isolation, of, minority, communities, from, redlining, educational, income, and, wealth, gaps, that, result, from, this, isolation, mean, that, minority, groups, limited, access, to, the, job, market, may, force, them, to, remain, in, fields, that, have, a, higher, risk, of, exposure, to, the, virus, without, options, to, take, time, off, finally, a, direct, result, of, redlining, is, the, overcrowding, of, minority, groups, into, neighborhoods, that, do, not, boast, adequate, housing, to, sustain, burgeoning, populations, leading, to, crowded, conditions, that, make, prevention, strategies, for, covid, 19, nearly, impossible, to, implement, as, a, general, rule, races, which, have, been, historically, and, systematically, colonized, typically, indigenous, ethnicities, continue, to, experience, lower, levels, of, financial, stability, in, the, present, day, the, global, south, is, considered, to, be, particularly, victimized, by, this, phenomenon, though, the, exact, socioeconomic, manifestations, change, across, different, regions, while, the, progression, of, civil, rights, movements, and, justice, reform, has, improved, access, to, education, and, other, economic, opportunities, in, politically, advanced, nations, racial, income, and, wealth, disparity, still, exists, in, the, united, states, for, example, african, american, populations, are, more, likely, to, drop, out, of, high, school, and, college, are, typically, employed, for, fewer, hours, at, lower, wages, have, lower, than, average, intergenerational, wealth, and, are, more, likely, to, use, welfare, as, young, adults, than, their, white, counterparts, the, racial, wealth, gap, in, the, us, has, been, maintained, throughout, history, in, 1863, two, years, prior, to, emancipation, from, slavery, black, people, owned, 0, 5, percent, of, the, us, national, wealth, while, in, 2019, it, is, just, over, 1, 5, percent, mexican, americans, while, suffering, less, debilitating, socioeconomic, factors, than, black, americans, experience, deficiencies, in, the, same, areas, when, compared, to, whites, and, have, not, assimilated, financially, to, the, level, of, stability, experienced, by, white, americans, as, a, whole, these, experiences, are, the, effects, of, the, measured, disparity, due, to, race, in, countries, like, the, us, where, studies, show, that, in, comparison, to, whites, blacks, suffer, from, drastically, lower, levels, of, upward, mobility, higher, levels, of, downward, mobility, and, poverty, that, is, more, easily, transmitted, to, offspring, as, a, result, of, the, disadvantage, stemming, from, the, era, of, slavery, and, post, slavery, racism, that, has, been, passed, through, racial, generations, to, the, present, these, are, lasting, financial, inequalities, that, apply, in, varying, magnitudes, to, most, non, white, populations, in, nations, such, as, the, us, the, uk, france, spain, australia, etc, in, the, countries, of, the, caribbean, central, america, and, south, america, many, ethnicities, continue, to, deal, with, the, effects, of, european, colonization, and, in, general, nonwhites, tend, to, be, noticeably, poorer, than, whites, in, this, region, in, many, countries, with, significant, populations, of, indigenous, races, and, those, of, afro, descent, such, as, mexico, colombia, chile, etc, income, levels, can, be, roughly, half, as, high, as, those, experiences, by, white, demographics, and, this, inequity, is, accompanied, by, systematically, unequal, access, to, education, career, opportunities, and, poverty, relief, this, region, of, the, world, apart, from, urbanizing, areas, like, brazil, and, costa, rica, continues, to, be, understudied, and, often, the, racial, disparity, is, denied, by, latin, americans, who, consider, themselves, to, be, living, in, post, racial, and, post, colonial, societies, far, removed, from, intense, social, and, economic, stratification, despite, the, evidence, to, the, contrary, african, countries, too, continue, to, deal, with, the, effects, of, the, trans, atlantic, slave, trade, which, set, back, economic, development, as, a, whole, for, blacks, of, african, citizenship, more, than, any, other, region, the, degree, to, which, colonizers, stratified, their, holdings, on, the, continent, on, the, basis, of, race, has, had, a, direct, correlation, in, the, magnitude, of, disparity, experienced, by, nonwhites, in, the, nations, that, eventually, rose, from, their, colonial, status, former, french, colonies, for, example, see, much, higher, rates, of, income, inequality, between, whites, and, nonwhites, as, a, result, of, the, rigid, hierarchy, imposed, by, the, french, who, lived, in, africa, at, the, time, another, example, is, found, in, south, africa, which, still, reeling, from, the, socioeconomic, impacts, of, apartheid, experiences, some, of, the, highest, racial, income, and, wealth, inequality, in, all, of, africa, in, these, and, other, countries, like, nigeria, zimbabwe, and, sierra, leone, movements, of, civil, reform, have, initially, led, to, improved, access, to, financial, advancement, opportunities, but, data, shows, that, for, nonwhites, this, progress, is, either, stalling, or, erasing, itself, in, the, newest, generation, of, blacks, that, seek, education, and, improved, transgenerational, wealth, the, economic, status, of, one, s, parents, continues, to, define, and, predict, the, financial, futures, of, african, and, minority, ethnic, groups, asian, regions, and, countries, such, as, china, the, middle, east, and, central, asia, have, been, vastly, understudied, in, terms, of, racial, disparity, but, even, here, the, effects, of, western, colonization, provide, similar, results, to, those, found, in, other, parts, of, the, globe, additionally, cultural, and, historical, practices, such, as, the, caste, system, in, india, leave, their, marks, as, well, while, the, disparity, is, greatly, improving, in, the, case, of, india, there, still, exists, social, stratification, between, peoples, of, lighter, and, darker, skin, tones, that, cumulatively, result, in, income, and, wealth, inequality, manifesting, in, many, of, the, same, poverty, traps, seen, elsewhere, economist, simon, kuznets, argued, that, levels, of, economic, inequality, are, in, large, part, the, result, of, stages, of, development, according, to, kuznets, countries, with, low, levels, of, development, have, relatively, equal, distributions, of, wealth, in, the, early, stages, individual, sectors, or, industries, are, developed, first, which, leads, to, an, unequal, distribution, of, income, and, wealth, resulting, in, growing, inequality, within, a, country, as, the, economy, progresses, and, development, takes, place, in, more, economic, sectors, eventually, attracting, more, workers, economic, inequality, decreases, although, the, kuznets, curve, described, the, development, of, inequality, well, at, the, time, of, its, publication, there, is, now, a, growing, number, of, critical, voices, questioning, the, link, between, inequality, and, development, wealth, concentration, is, the, process, by, which, under, certain, conditions, newly, created, wealth, concentrates, in, the, possession, of, already, wealthy, individuals, or, entities, accordingly, those, who, already, hold, wealth, have, the, means, to, invest, in, new, sources, of, creating, wealth, or, to, otherwise, leverage, the, accumulation, of, wealth, and, thus, they, are, the, beneficiaries, of, the, new, wealth, over, time, wealth, concentration, can, significantly, contribute, to, the, persistence, of, inequality, within, society, thomas, piketty, in, his, book, capital, in, the, twenty, first, century, argues, that, the, fundamental, force, for, divergence, is, the, usually, greater, return, of, capital, r, than, economic, growth, g, and, that, larger, fortunes, generate, higher, returns, economist, joseph, stiglitz, argues, that, rather, than, explaining, concentrations, of, wealth, and, income, market, forces, should, serve, as, a, brake, on, such, concentration, which, may, better, be, explained, by, the, non, market, force, known, as, rent, seeking, while, the, market, will, bid, up, compensation, for, rare, and, desired, skills, to, reward, wealth, creation, greater, productivity, etc, it, will, also, prevent, successful, entrepreneurs, from, earning, excess, profits, by, fostering, competition, to, cut, prices, profits, and, large, compensation, a, better, explainer, of, growing, inequality, according, to, stiglitz, is, the, use, of, political, power, generated, by, wealth, by, certain, groups, to, shape, government, policies, financially, beneficial, to, them, this, process, known, to, economists, as, rent, seeking, brings, income, not, from, creation, of, wealth, but, from, grabbing, a, larger, share, of, the, wealth, that, would, otherwise, have, been, produced, without, their, effort, jamie, galbraith, argues, that, countries, with, larger, financial, sectors, have, greater, inequality, and, the, link, is, not, an, accident, a, 2019, study, published, in, pnas, found, that, global, warming, plays, a, role, in, increasing, economic, inequality, between, countries, boosting, economic, growth, in, developed, countries, while, hampering, such, growth, in, developing, nations, of, the, global, south, the, study, says, that, 25, of, gap, between, the, developed, world, and, the, developing, world, can, be, attributed, to, global, warming, a, 2020, report, by, oxfam, and, the, stockholm, environment, institute, says, that, the, wealthiest, 10, of, the, global, population, were, responsible, for, more, than, half, of, global, carbon, dioxide, emissions, from, 1990, to, 2015, which, increased, by, 60, according, to, a, 2020, report, by, the, unep, overconsumption, by, the, rich, is, a, significant, driver, of, the, climate, crisis, and, the, wealthiest, 1, of, the, world, s, population, are, responsible, for, more, than, double, the, greenhouse, gas, emissions, of, the, poorest, 50, combined, inger, andersen, in, the, foreword, to, the, report, said, this, elite, will, need, to, reduce, their, footprint, by, a, factor, of, 30, to, stay, in, line, with, the, paris, agreement, targets, a, 2022, report, by, oxfam, found, that, the, business, investments, of, the, wealthiest, 125, billionaires, emit, 393, million, metric, tonnes, of, greenhouse, gas, emissions, annually, in, july, 2023, a, letter, sent, to, the, united, nations, secretary, general, ant, nio, guterres, and, world, bank, president, ajay, banga, by, a, group, of, over, 200, economists, from, 67, countries, including, jayati, ghosh, joseph, stiglitz, and, thomas, piketty, warned, that, if, the, sharp, increase, in, economic, inequality, is, not, reversed, it, will, entrench, poverty, and, increase, the, risk, of, climate, breakdown, according, to, unctad, s, world, investment, report, poorer, countries, would, need, 4, trillion, per, year, to, accomplish, the, sdgs, by, 2030, up, from, 1, 5, trillion, in, 2015, 1, 7, trillion, in, green, energy, investment, is, required, each, year, while, the, majority, of, green, foreign, direct, investment, continues, to, flow, to, established, nations, joseph, stiglitz, argues, in, the, price, of, inequality, 2012, that, the, economic, inequality, is, inevitable, and, permanent, because, it, is, caused, by, the, great, amount, of, political, power, the, richest, have, he, wrote, while, there, may, be, underlying, economic, forces, at, play, politics, have, shaped, the, market, and, shaped, it, in, ways, that, advantage, the, top, at, the, expense, of, the, rest, research, has, shown, that, biased, decision, making, does, not, alone, explain, a, significant, proportion, of, inequality, therefore, inequality, cannot, be, explained, by, cognitive, biases, of, a, specific, sub, population, such, as, temporal, discounting, i, e, not, preferring, immediate, funds, over, larger, future, gains, overestimation, i, e, thinking, you, are, better, than, you, are, at, making, decisions, over, placement, i, e, thinking, you, are, better, than, the, average, person, at, making, decisions, and, extremeness, aversion, i, e, taking, the, middle, option, simply, because, it, seems, safer, than, the, highest, or, lowest, countries, with, a, left, leaning, legislature, generally, have, lower, levels, of, inequality, many, factors, constrain, economic, inequality, they, may, be, divided, into, two, classes, market, driven, and, government, sponsored, the, relative, merits, and, effectiveness, of, each, approach, is, a, subject, of, debate, market, forces, outside, of, government, intervention, that, can, reduce, economic, inequality, include, typical, government, initiatives, intended, to, reduce, economic, inequality, include, research, shows, that, since, 1300, the, only, periods, with, significant, declines, in, wealth, inequality, in, europe, were, the, black, death, and, the, two, world, wars, historian, walter, scheidel, posits, that, since, the, stone, age, only, extreme, violence, catastrophes, and, upheaval, in, the, form, of, total, war, communist, revolutions, the, french, revolution, pestilence, and, state, collapse, have, significantly, reduced, inequality, he, has, stated, that, only, all, out, thermonuclear, war, might, fundamentally, reset, the, existing, distribution, of, resources, and, that, peaceful, policy, reform, may, well, prove, unequal, to, the, growing, challenges, ahead, however, scheidel, also, stated, that, there, is, certainly, room, for, incremental, change, that, s, what, the, example, of, latin, america, shows, in, the, past, 15, years, or, so, a, 2011, oecd, study, makes, a, number, of, suggestions, to, its, member, countries, including, progressive, taxation, reduces, absolute, income, inequality, when, the, higher, rates, on, higher, income, individuals, are, paid, and, not, evaded, and, transfer, payments, and, social, safety, nets, result, in, progressive, government, spending, wage, ratio, legislation, has, also, been, proposed, as, a, means, of, reducing, income, inequality, the, oecd, asserts, that, public, spending, is, vital, in, reducing, the, ever, expanding, wealth, gap, deferred, investment, programs, that, increase, stock, ownership, amongst, lower, income, levels, can, supplement, income, to, compensate, wage, stagnation, the, economists, emmanuel, saez, and, thomas, piketty, recommend, much, higher, top, marginal, tax, rates, on, the, wealthy, up, to, 50, percent, 70, percent, or, even, 90, percent, ralph, nader, jeffrey, sachs, the, united, front, against, austerity, among, others, call, for, a, financial, transaction, tax, also, known, as, the, robin, hood, tax, to, bolster, the, social, safety, net, and, the, public, sector, the, economist, wrote, in, december, 2013, a, minimum, wage, providing, it, is, not, set, too, high, could, thus, boost, pay, with, no, ill, effects, on, jobs, america, s, federal, minimum, wage, at, 38, of, median, income, is, one, of, the, rich, world, s, lowest, some, studies, find, no, harm, to, employment, from, federal, or, state, minimum, wages, others, see, a, small, one, but, none, finds, any, serious, damage, general, limitations, on, and, taxation, of, rent, seeking, are, popular, across, the, political, spectrum, public, policy, responses, addressing, causes, and, effects, of, income, inequality, in, the, us, include, progressive, tax, incidence, adjustments, strengthening, social, safety, net, provisions, such, as, aid, to, families, with, dependent, children, welfare, the, food, stamp, program, social, security, medicare, and, medicaid, organizing, community, interest, groups, increasing, and, reforming, higher, education, subsidies, increasing, infrastructure, spending, and, placing, limits, on, and, taxing, rent, seeking, a, 2017, study, in, the, journal, of, political, economy, by, daron, acemoglu, james, robinson, and, thierry, verdier, argues, that, american, cutthroat, capitalism, and, inequality, gives, rise, to, technology, and, innovation, that, more, cuddly, forms, of, capitalism, cannot, as, a, result, the, diversity, of, institutions, we, observe, among, relatively, advanced, countries, ranging, from, greater, inequality, and, risk, taking, in, the, united, states, to, the, more, egalitarian, societies, supported, by, a, strong, safety, net, in, scandinavia, rather, than, reflecting, differences, in, fundamentals, between, the, citizens, of, these, societies, may, emerge, as, a, mutually, self, reinforcing, world, equilibrium, if, so, in, this, equilibrium, we, cannot, all, be, like, the, scandinavians, because, scandinavian, capitalism, depends, in, part, on, the, knowledge, spillovers, created, by, the, more, cutthroat, american, capitalism, a, 2012, working, paper, by, the, same, authors, making, similar, arguments, was, challenged, by, lane, kenworthy, who, posited, that, among, other, things, the, nordic, countries, are, consistently, ranked, as, some, of, the, world, s, most, innovative, countries, by, the, world, economic, forum, s, global, competitiveness, index, with, sweden, ranking, as, the, most, innovative, nation, followed, by, finland, for, 2012, 2013, the, u, s, ranked, sixth, there, are, however, global, initiative, like, the, united, nations, sustainable, development, goal, 10, which, aims, to, garner, international, efforts, in, reducing, economic, inequality, considerably, by, 2030, a, lot, of, research, has, been, done, about, the, effects, of, economic, inequality, on, different, aspects, in, society, socialists, attribute, the, vast, disparities, in, wealth, to, the, private, ownership, of, the, means, of, production, by, a, class, of, owners, creating, a, situation, where, a, small, portion, of, the, population, lives, off, unearned, property, income, by, virtue, of, ownership, titles, in, capital, equipment, financial, assets, and, corporate, stock, by, contrast, the, vast, majority, of, the, population, is, dependent, on, income, in, the, form, of, a, wage, or, salary, in, order, to, rectify, this, situation, socialists, argue, that, the, means, of, production, should, be, socially, owned, so, that, income, differentials, would, be, reflective, of, individual, contributions, to, the, social, product, marxian, economics, attributes, rising, inequality, to, job, automation, and, capital, deepening, within, capitalism, the, process, of, job, automation, conflicts, with, the, capitalist, property, form, and, its, attendant, system, of, wage, labor, in, this, analysis, capitalist, firms, increasingly, substitute, capital, equipment, for, labor, inputs, workers, under, competitive, pressure, to, reduce, costs, and, maximize, profits, over, the, long, term, this, trend, increases, the, organic, composition, of, capital, meaning, that, less, workers, are, required, in, proportion, to, capital, inputs, increasing, unemployment, the, reserve, army, of, labour, this, process, exerts, a, downward, pressure, on, wages, the, substitution, of, capital, equipment, for, labor, mechanization, and, automation, raises, the, productivity, of, each, worker, resulting, in, a, situation, of, relatively, stagnant, wages, for, the, working, class, amidst, rising, levels, of, property, income, for, the, capitalist, class, marxist, socialists, ultimately, predict, the, emergence, of, a, communist, society, based, on, the, common, ownership, of, the, means, of, production, where, each, individual, citizen, would, have, free, access, to, the, articles, of, consumption, from, each, according, to, his, ability, to, each, according, to, his, need, according, to, marxist, philosophy, equality, in, the, sense, of, free, access, is, essential, for, freeing, individuals, from, dependent, relationships, thereby, allowing, them, to, transcend, alienation, meritocracy, favors, an, eventual, society, where, an, individual, s, success, is, a, direct, function, of, his, merit, or, contribution, economic, inequality, would, be, a, natural, consequence, of, the, wide, range, in, individual, skill, talent, and, effort, in, human, population, david, landes, stated, that, the, progression, of, western, economic, development, that, led, to, the, industrial, revolution, was, facilitated, by, men, advancing, through, their, own, merit, rather, than, because, of, family, or, political, connections, most, modern, social, liberals, including, centrist, or, left, of, center, political, groups, believe, that, the, capitalist, economic, system, should, be, fundamentally, preserved, but, the, status, quo, regarding, the, income, gap, must, be, reformed, social, liberals, favor, a, capitalist, system, with, active, keynesian, macroeconomic, policies, and, progressive, taxation, to, even, out, differences, in, income, inequality, research, indicates, that, people, who, hold, liberal, beliefs, tend, to, see, greater, income, inequality, as, morally, wrong, however, contemporary, classical, liberals, and, libertarians, generally, do, not, take, a, stance, on, wealth, inequality, but, believe, in, equality, under, the, law, regardless, of, whether, it, leads, to, unequal, wealth, distribution, in, 1966, ludwig, von, mises, a, prominent, figure, in, the, austrian, school, of, economic, thought, explains, the, liberal, champions, of, equality, under, the, law, were, fully, aware, of, the, fact, that, men, are, born, unequal, and, that, it, is, precisely, their, inequality, that, generates, social, cooperation, and, civilization, equality, under, the, law, was, in, their, opinion, not, designed, to, correct, the, inexorable, facts, of, the, universe, and, to, make, natural, inequality, disappear, it, was, on, the, contrary, the, device, to, secure, for, the, whole, of, mankind, the, maximum, of, benefits, it, can, derive, from, it, henceforth, no, man, made, institutions, should, prevent, a, man, from, attaining, that, station, in, which, he, can, best, serve, his, fellow, citizens, robert, nozick, argued, that, government, redistributes, wealth, by, force, usually, in, the, form, of, taxation, and, that, the, ideal, moral, society, would, be, one, where, all, individuals, are, free, from, force, however, nozick, recognized, that, some, modern, economic, inequalities, were, the, result, of, forceful, taking, of, property, and, a, certain, amount, of, redistribution, would, be, justified, to, compensate, for, this, force, but, not, because, of, the, inequalities, themselves, john, rawls, argued, in, a, theory, of, justice, that, inequalities, in, the, distribution, of, wealth, are, only, justified, when, they, improve, society, as, a, whole, including, the, poorest, members, rawls, does, not, discuss, the, full, implications, of, his, theory, of, justice, some, see, rawls, s, argument, as, a, justification, for, capitalism, since, even, the, poorest, members, of, society, theoretically, benefit, from, increased, innovations, under, capitalism, others, believe, only, a, strong, welfare, state, can, satisfy, rawls, s, theory, of, justice, classical, liberal, milton, friedman, believed, that, if, government, action, is, taken, in, pursuit, of, economic, equality, then, political, freedom, would, suffer, in, a, famous, quote, he, said, a, society, that, puts, equality, before, freedom, will, get, neither, a, society, that, puts, freedom, before, equality, will, get, a, high, degree, of, both, economist, tyler, cowen, has, argued, that, though, income, inequality, has, increased, within, nations, globally, it, has, fallen, over, the, 20, years, leading, up, to, 2014, he, argues, that, though, income, inequality, may, make, individual, nations, worse, off, overall, the, world, has, improved, as, global, inequality, has, been, reduced, patrick, diamond, and, anthony, giddens, professors, of, economics, and, sociology, respectively, hold, that, pure, meritocracy, is, incoherent, because, without, redistribution, one, generation, s, successful, individuals, would, become, the, next, generation, s, embedded, caste, hoarding, the, wealth, they, had, accumulated, they, also, state, that, social, justice, requires, redistribution, of, high, incomes, and, large, concentrations, of, wealth, in, a, way, that, spreads, it, more, widely, in, order, to, recognize, the, contribution, made, by, all, sections, of, the, community, to, building, the, nation, s, wealth, patrick, diamond, and, anthony, giddens, june, 27, 2005, new, statesman, pope, francis, stated, in, his, evangelii, gaudium, that, as, long, as, the, problems, of, the, poor, are, not, radically, resolved, by, rejecting, the, absolute, autonomy, of, markets, and, financial, speculation, and, by, attacking, the, structural, causes, of, inequality, no, solution, will, be, found, for, the, world, s, problems, or, for, that, matter, to, any, problems, he, later, declared, that, inequality, is, the, root, of, social, evil, when, income, inequality, is, low, aggregate, demand, will, be, relatively, high, because, more, people, who, want, ordinary, consumer, goods, and, services, will, be, able, to, afford, them, while, the, labor, force, will, not, be, as, relatively, monopolized, by, the, wealthy, in, most, western, democracies, the, desire, to, eliminate, or, reduce, economic, inequality, is, generally, associated, with, the, political, left, one, practical, argument, in, favor, of, reduction, is, the, idea, that, economic, inequality, reduces, social, cohesion, and, increases, social, unrest, thereby, weakening, the, society, there, is, evidence, that, this, is, true, see, inequity, aversion, and, it, is, intuitive, at, least, for, small, face, to, face, groups, of, people, alberto, alesina, rafael, di, tella, and, robert, macculloch, find, that, inequality, negatively, affects, happiness, in, europe, but, not, in, the, united, states, it, has, also, been, argued, that, economic, inequality, invariably, translates, to, political, inequality, which, further, aggravates, the, problem, even, in, cases, where, an, increase, in, economic, inequality, makes, nobody, economically, poorer, an, increased, inequality, of, resources, is, disadvantageous, as, increased, economic, inequality, can, lead, to, a, power, shift, due, to, an, increased, inequality, in, the, ability, to, participate, in, democratic, processes, according, to, paul, and, moser, countries, with, high, income, inequality, and, poor, unemployment, protections, experience, worse, mental, health, outcomes, among, the, unemployed, the, capabilities, approach, sometimes, called, the, human, development, approach, looks, at, income, inequality, and, poverty, as, form, of, capability, deprivation, unlike, neoliberalism, which, defines, well, being, as, utility, maximization, economic, growth, and, income, are, considered, a, means, to, an, end, rather, than, the, end, itself, its, goal, is, to, wid, people, s, choices, and, the, level, of, their, achieved, well, being, through, increasing, functioning, the, things, a, person, values, doing, capabilities, the, freedom, to, enjoy, functionings, and, agency, the, ability, to, pursue, valued, goals, when, a, person, s,
