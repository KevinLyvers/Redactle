psychoanalysis, is, a, set, of, theories, and, therapeutic, techniques, that, deal, in, part, with, the, unconscious, mind, and, which, together, form, a, method, of, treatment, for, mental, disorders, the, discipline, was, established, in, the, early, 1890s, by, sigmund, freud, whose, work, stemmed, partly, from, the, clinical, work, of, josef, breuer, and, others, freud, developed, and, refined, the, theory, and, practice, of, psychoanalysis, until, his, death, in, 1939, in, an, encyclopedic, article, he, identified, the, cornerstones, of, psychoanalysis, as, the, assumption, that, there, are, unconscious, mental, processes, the, recognition, of, the, theory, of, repression, and, resistance, the, appreciation, of, the, importance, of, sexuality, and, of, the, oedipus, complex, freud, s, colleagues, alfred, adler, and, carl, gustav, jung, developed, offshoots, of, psychoanalysis, which, they, called, individual, psychology, adler, and, analytical, psychology, jung, although, freud, himself, wrote, a, number, of, criticisms, of, them, and, emphatically, denied, that, they, were, forms, of, psychoanalysis, psychoanalysis, was, later, developed, in, different, directions, by, neo, freudian, thinkers, such, as, erich, fromm, karen, horney, and, harry, stack, sullivan, freud, distinguished, between, the, conscious, and, the, unconscious, mind, arguing, that, the, unconscious, mind, largely, determines, behaviour, and, cognition, owing, to, unconscious, drives, freud, observed, that, attempts, to, bring, such, drives, into, awareness, triggers, resistance, in, the, form, of, defense, mechanisms, particularly, repression, and, that, conflicts, between, conscious, and, unconscious, material, can, result, in, mental, disturbances, he, also, postulated, that, unconscious, material, can, be, found, in, dreams, and, unintentional, acts, including, mannerisms, and, freudian, slips, psychoanalytic, therapy, or, simply, analytical, therapy, developed, as, a, means, to, improve, mental, health, by, bringing, unconscious, material, into, consciousness, psychoanalysts, place, a, large, emphasis, on, early, childhood, in, an, individual, s, development, during, therapy, a, psychoanalyst, aims, to, induce, transference, whereby, patients, relive, their, infantile, conflicts, by, projecting, onto, the, analyst, feelings, of, love, dependence, and, anger, during, psychoanalytic, sessions, a, patient, traditionally, lies, on, a, couch, and, an, analyst, sits, just, behind, and, out, of, sight, the, patient, expresses, their, thoughts, including, free, associations, fantasies, and, dreams, from, which, the, analyst, infers, the, unconscious, conflicts, causing, the, patient, s, symptoms, and, character, problems, through, the, analysis, of, these, conflicts, which, includes, interpreting, the, transference, and, countertransference, the, analyst, s, feelings, for, the, patient, the, analyst, confronts, the, patient, s, pathological, defence, mechanisms, to, help, patients, understand, themselves, better, psychoanalysis, is, a, controversial, discipline, and, its, effectiveness, as, a, treatment, has, been, contested, although, it, retains, influence, within, psychiatry, psychoanalytic, concepts, are, also, widely, used, outside, the, therapeutic, arena, in, areas, such, as, psychoanalytic, literary, criticism, and, film, criticism, analysis, of, fairy, tales, philosophical, perspectives, such, as, freudo, marxism, and, other, cultural, phenomena, the, idea, of, psychoanalysis, german, psychoanalyse, first, began, to, receive, serious, attention, under, sigmund, freud, who, formulated, his, own, theory, of, psychoanalysis, in, vienna, in, the, 1890s, freud, was, a, neurologist, trying, to, find, an, effective, treatment, for, patients, with, neurotic, or, hysterical, symptoms, freud, realised, that, there, were, mental, processes, that, were, not, conscious, whilst, he, was, employed, as, a, neurological, consultant, at, the, children, s, hospital, where, he, noticed, that, many, aphasic, children, had, no, apparent, organic, cause, for, their, symptoms, he, then, wrote, a, monograph, about, this, subject, in, 1885, freud, obtained, a, grant, to, study, with, jean, martin, charcot, a, famed, neurologist, at, the, salp, tri, re, in, paris, where, he, followed, the, clinical, presentations, of, charcot, particularly, in, the, areas, of, hysteria, paralyses, and, the, anaesthesias, charcot, had, introduced, hypnotism, as, an, experimental, research, tool, and, developed, photographic, representation, of, clinical, symptoms, freud, s, first, theory, to, explain, hysterical, symptoms, was, presented, in, studies, on, hysteria, 1895, studien, ber, hysterie, co, authored, with, his, mentor, the, distinguished, physician, josef, breuer, which, was, generally, seen, as, the, birth, of, psychoanalysis, the, work, was, based, on, breuer, s, treatment, of, bertha, pappenheim, referred, to, in, case, studies, by, the, pseudonym, anna, o, treatment, which, pappenheim, herself, had, dubbed, the, talking, cure, breuer, wrote, that, many, factors, could, result, in, such, symptoms, including, various, types, of, emotional, trauma, and, he, also, credited, work, by, others, such, as, pierre, janet, while, freud, contended, that, at, the, root, of, hysterical, symptoms, were, repressed, memories, of, distressing, occurrences, almost, always, having, direct, or, indirect, sexual, associations, around, the, same, time, freud, attempted, to, develop, a, neuro, physiological, theory, of, unconscious, mental, mechanisms, which, he, soon, gave, up, it, remained, unpublished, in, his, lifetime, the, term, psychoanalysis, psychoanalyse, was, first, introduced, by, freud, in, his, essay, titled, heredity, and, etiology, of, neuroses, l, h, r, dit, et, l, tiologie, des, n, vroses, written, and, published, in, french, in, 1896, in, 1896, freud, also, published, his, seduction, theory, claiming, to, have, uncovered, repressed, memories, of, incidents, of, sexual, abuse, for, all, his, current, patients, from, which, he, proposed, that, the, preconditions, for, hysterical, symptoms, are, sexual, excitations, in, infancy, though, in, 1896, he, had, reported, that, his, patients, had, no, feeling, of, remembering, the, scenes, and, assured, him, emphatically, of, their, unbelief, 204, in, later, accounts, he, claimed, that, they, had, told, him, that, they, had, been, sexually, abused, in, infancy, by, 1898, he, had, privately, acknowledged, to, his, friend, and, colleague, wilhelm, fliess, that, he, no, longer, believed, in, his, theory, though, he, did, not, state, this, publicly, until, 1906, building, on, his, claims, that, the, patients, reported, infantile, sexual, abuse, experiences, freud, subsequently, contended, that, his, clinical, findings, in, the, mid, 1890s, provided, evidence, of, the, occurrence, of, unconscious, fantasies, supposedly, to, cover, up, memories, of, infantile, masturbation, only, much, later, did, he, claim, the, same, findings, as, evidence, for, oedipal, desires, in, the, latter, part, of, the, 20th, century, several, freud, scholars, challenged, freud, s, perception, of, the, patients, who, informed, him, of, childhood, sexual, abuse, arguing, that, he, had, imposed, his, preconceived, notions, on, his, patients, by, 1899, freud, had, theorised, that, dreams, had, symbolic, significance, and, generally, were, specific, to, the, dreamer, freud, formulated, his, second, psychological, theory, that, the, unconscious, has, or, is, a, primary, process, consisting, of, symbolic, and, condensed, thoughts, and, a, secondary, process, of, logical, conscious, thoughts, this, theory, was, published, in, his, 1899, book, the, interpretation, of, dreams, which, freud, thought, of, as, his, most, significant, work, freud, outlined, a, new, topographic, theory, which, theorised, that, unacceptable, sexual, wishes, were, repressed, into, the, system, unconscious, these, wishes, were, made, unconscious, due, to, society, s, condemnation, of, premarital, sexual, activity, and, this, repression, created, anxiety, this, topographic, theory, is, still, popular, in, much, of, europe, although, it, has, fallen, out, of, favour, in, much, of, north, america, where, it, has, been, largely, supplanted, by, structural, theory, in, addition, the, interpretation, of, dreams, contained, freud, s, first, conceptualisation, of, the, oedipal, complex, which, asserted, that, young, boys, are, sexually, attracted, to, their, mothers, and, envious, of, their, fathers, for, being, able, to, have, sex, with, their, mothers, psychologist, frank, sulloway, in, his, book, freud, biologist, of, the, mind, beyond, the, psychoanalytic, legend, argues, that, freud, s, biological, theories, like, libido, were, rooted, in, the, biological, hypothesis, that, accompanied, the, work, of, charles, darwin, citing, theories, of, krafft, ebing, molland, havelock, ellis, haeckel, wilhelm, fliess, as, influencing, freud, 30, in, 1905, freud, published, three, essays, on, the, theory, of, sexuality, in, which, he, laid, out, his, discovery, of, the, psychosexual, phases, which, categorised, early, childhood, development, into, five, stages, depending, on, what, sexual, affinity, a, child, possessed, at, the, stage, his, early, formulation, included, the, idea, that, because, of, societal, restrictions, sexual, wishes, were, repressed, into, an, unconscious, state, and, that, the, energy, of, these, unconscious, wishes, could, be, result, in, anxiety, or, physical, symptoms, early, treatment, techniques, including, hypnotism, and, abreaction, were, designed, to, make, the, unconscious, conscious, in, order, to, relieve, the, pressure, and, the, apparently, resulting, symptoms, this, method, would, later, on, be, left, aside, by, freud, giving, free, association, a, bigger, role, in, on, narcissism, 1915, freud, turned, his, attention, to, the, titular, subject, of, narcissism, freud, characterized, the, difference, between, energy, directed, at, the, self, versus, energy, directed, at, others, using, a, system, known, as, cathexis, by, 1917, in, mourning, and, melancholia, he, suggested, that, certain, depressions, were, caused, by, turning, guilt, ridden, anger, on, the, self, in, 1919, through, a, child, is, being, beaten, he, began, to, address, the, problems, of, self, destructive, behavior, and, sexual, masochism, based, on, his, experience, with, depressed, and, self, destructive, patients, and, pondering, the, carnage, of, world, war, i, freud, became, dissatisfied, with, considering, only, oral, and, sexual, motivations, for, behavior, by, 1920, freud, addressed, the, power, of, identification, with, the, leader, and, with, other, members, in, groups, as, a, motivation, for, behavior, in, group, psychology, and, the, analysis, of, the, ego, in, that, same, year, freud, suggested, his, dual, drive, theory, of, sexuality, and, aggression, in, beyond, the, pleasure, principle, to, try, to, begin, to, explain, human, destructiveness, also, it, was, the, first, appearance, of, his, structural, theory, consisting, of, three, new, concepts, id, ego, and, superego, three, years, later, in, 1923, he, summarised, the, ideas, of, id, ego, and, superego, in, the, ego, and, the, id, in, the, book, he, revised, the, whole, theory, of, mental, functioning, now, considering, that, repression, was, only, one, of, many, defense, mechanisms, and, that, it, occurred, to, reduce, anxiety, hence, freud, characterised, repression, as, both, a, cause, and, a, result, of, anxiety, in, 1926, in, inhibitions, symptoms, and, anxiety, freud, characterised, how, intrapsychic, conflict, among, drive, and, superego, caused, anxiety, and, how, that, anxiety, could, lead, to, an, inhibition, of, mental, functions, such, as, intellect, and, speech, in, 1924, otto, rank, published, the, trauma, of, birth, which, analysed, culture, and, philosophy, in, relation, to, separation, anxiety, which, occurred, before, the, development, of, an, oedipal, complex, freud, s, theories, however, characterized, no, such, phase, according, to, freud, the, oedipus, complex, was, at, the, centre, of, neurosis, and, was, the, foundational, source, of, all, art, myth, religion, philosophy, therapy, indeed, of, all, human, culture, and, civilization, it, was, the, first, time, that, anyone, in, freud, s, inner, circle, had, characterised, something, other, than, the, oedipus, complex, as, contributing, to, intrapsychic, development, a, notion, that, was, rejected, by, freud, and, his, followers, at, the, time, by, 1936, the, principle, of, multiple, function, was, clarified, by, robert, waelder, he, widened, the, formulation, that, psychological, symptoms, were, caused, by, and, relieved, conflict, simultaneously, moreover, symptoms, such, as, phobias, and, compulsions, each, represented, elements, of, some, drive, wish, sexual, and, or, aggressive, superego, anxiety, reality, and, defenses, also, in, 1936, anna, freud, sigmund, s, daughter, published, her, seminal, book, the, ego, and, the, mechanisms, of, defense, outlining, numerous, ways, the, mind, could, shut, upsetting, things, out, of, consciousness, when, hitler, s, power, grew, the, freud, family, and, many, of, their, colleagues, fled, to, london, within, a, year, sigmund, freud, died, in, the, united, states, also, following, the, death, of, freud, a, new, group, of, psychoanalysts, began, to, explore, the, function, of, the, ego, led, by, heinz, hartmann, the, group, built, upon, understandings, of, the, synthetic, function, of, the, ego, as, a, mediator, in, psychic, functioning, distinguishing, such, from, autonomous, ego, functions, e, g, memory, and, intellect, these, ego, psychologists, of, the, 1950s, paved, a, way, to, focus, analytic, work, by, attending, to, the, defenses, mediated, by, the, ego, before, exploring, the, deeper, roots, to, the, unconscious, conflicts, in, addition, there, was, growing, interest, in, child, psychoanalysis, psychoanalysis, has, been, used, as, a, research, tool, into, childhood, development, and, is, still, used, to, treat, certain, mental, disturbances, in, the, 1960s, freud, s, early, thoughts, on, the, childhood, development, of, female, sexuality, were, challenged, this, challenge, led, to, the, development, of, a, variety, of, understandings, of, female, sexual, development, many, of, which, modified, the, timing, and, normality, of, several, of, freud, s, theories, several, researchers, followed, karen, horney, s, studies, of, societal, pressures, that, influence, the, development, of, women, in, the, first, decade, of, the, 21st, century, there, were, approximately, 35, training, institutes, for, psychoanalysis, in, the, united, states, accredited, by, the, american, psychoanalytic, association, apsaa, which, is, a, component, organization, of, the, international, psychoanalytical, association, ipa, and, there, are, over, 3000, graduated, psychoanalysts, practicing, in, the, united, states, the, ipa, accredits, psychoanalytic, training, centers, through, such, component, organisations, throughout, the, rest, of, the, world, including, countries, such, as, serbia, france, germany, austria, italy, switzerland, and, many, others, as, well, as, about, six, institutes, directly, in, the, united, states, freud, founded, the, psychological, wednesday, society, in, 1902, which, edward, shorter, argues, was, the, beginning, of, psychoanalysis, as, a, movement, this, society, became, the, vienna, psychoanalytic, society, in, 1908, in, the, same, year, as, the, first, international, congress, of, psychoanalysis, held, in, salzburg, austria, 110, alfred, adler, was, one, of, the, most, active, members, in, this, society, in, its, early, years, 584, the, second, congress, of, psychoanalysis, took, place, in, nuremberg, germany, in, 1910, 110, at, this, congress, ferenczi, called, for, the, creation, of, an, international, psychoanalytic, association, with, jung, as, president, for, life, 15, a, third, congress, was, held, in, weimar, in, 1911, 110, the, london, psychoanalytical, society, was, founded, in, 1913, by, ernest, jones, in, the, 1950s, psychoanalysis, was, the, main, modality, of, psychotherapy, behavioural, models, of, psychotherapy, started, to, assume, a, more, central, role, in, psychotherapy, in, the, 1960s, aaron, t, beck, a, psychiatrist, trained, in, a, psychoanalytic, tradition, set, out, to, test, the, psychoanalytic, models, of, depression, empirically, and, found, that, conscious, ruminations, of, loss, and, personal, failing, were, correlated, with, depression, he, suggested, that, distorted, and, biased, beliefs, were, a, causal, factor, of, depression, publishing, an, influential, paper, in, 1967, after, a, decade, of, research, using, the, construct, of, schemas, to, explain, the, depression, 221, beck, developed, this, empirically, supported, hypothesis, for, the, cause, of, depression, into, a, talking, therapy, called, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, cbt, in, the, early, 1970s, attachment, theory, was, developed, theoretically, by, john, bowlby, and, formalized, empirically, by, mary, ainsworth, bowlby, was, trained, psychoanalytically, but, was, concerned, about, some, properties, of, psychoanalysis, 23, he, was, troubled, by, the, dogmatism, of, psychoanalysis, at, the, time, its, arcane, terminology, the, lack, of, attention, to, environment, in, child, behaviour, and, the, concepts, derived, from, talking, therapy, to, child, behaviour, 23, in, response, he, developed, an, alternative, conceptualization, of, child, behaviour, based, on, principles, on, ethology, 24, bowlby, s, theory, of, attachment, rejects, freud, s, model, of, psychosexual, development, based, on, the, oedipal, model, 25, for, his, work, bowlby, was, shunned, from, psychoanalytical, circles, who, did, not, accept, his, theories, nonetheless, his, conceptualization, was, adopted, widely, by, mother, infant, research, in, the, 1970s, 26, the, predominant, psychoanalytic, theories, can, be, organised, into, several, theoretical, schools, although, these, perspectives, differ, most, of, them, emphasize, the, influence, of, unconscious, elements, on, the, conscious, there, has, also, been, considerable, work, done, on, consolidating, elements, of, conflicting, theories, there, are, some, persistent, conflicts, among, psychoanalysts, regarding, specific, causes, of, certain, syndromes, and, some, disputes, regarding, the, ideal, treatment, techniques, in, the, 21st, century, psychoanalytic, ideas, have, found, influence, in, fields, such, as, childcare, education, literary, criticism, cultural, studies, mental, health, and, particularly, psychotherapy, though, most, mainstream, psychoanalysts, subscribe, to, modern, strains, of, psychoanalytical, thought, there, are, groups, who, follow, the, precepts, of, a, single, psychoanalyst, and, their, school, of, thought, psychoanalytic, ideas, also, play, roles, in, some, types, of, literary, analysis, such, as, archetypal, literary, criticism, topographic, theory, was, named, and, first, described, by, sigmund, freud, in, the, interpretation, of, dreams, 1899, the, theory, hypothesizes, that, the, mental, apparatus, can, be, divided, into, the, systems, conscious, preconscious, and, unconscious, these, systems, are, not, anatomical, structures, of, the, brain, but, rather, mental, processes, although, freud, retained, this, theory, throughout, his, life, he, largely, replaced, it, with, the, structural, theory, structural, theory, divides, the, psyche, into, the, id, the, ego, and, the, super, ego, the, id, is, present, at, birth, as, the, repository, of, basic, instincts, which, freud, called, triebe, drives, unorganized, and, unconscious, it, operates, merely, on, the, pleasure, principle, without, realism, or, foresight, the, ego, develops, slowly, and, gradually, being, concerned, with, mediating, between, the, urging, of, the, id, and, the, realities, of, the, external, world, it, thus, operates, on, the, reality, principle, the, super, ego, is, held, to, be, the, part, of, the, ego, in, which, self, observation, self, criticism, and, other, reflective, and, judgmental, faculties, develop, the, ego, and, the, super, ego, are, both, partly, conscious, and, partly, unconscious, during, the, twentieth, century, many, different, clinical, and, theoretical, models, of, psychoanalysis, emerged, ego, psychology, was, initially, suggested, by, freud, in, inhibitions, symptoms, and, anxiety, 1926, while, major, steps, forward, would, be, made, through, anna, freud, s, work, on, defense, mechanisms, first, published, in, her, book, the, ego, and, the, mechanisms, of, defence, 1936, the, theory, was, refined, by, hartmann, loewenstein, and, kris, in, a, series, of, papers, and, books, from, 1939, through, the, late, 1960s, leo, bellak, was, a, later, contributor, this, series, of, constructs, paralleling, some, of, the, later, developments, of, cognitive, theory, includes, the, notions, of, autonomous, ego, functions, mental, functions, not, dependent, at, least, in, origin, on, intrapsychic, conflict, such, functions, include, sensory, perception, motor, control, symbolic, thought, logical, thought, speech, abstraction, integration, synthesis, orientation, concentration, judgment, about, danger, reality, testing, adaptive, ability, executive, decision, making, hygiene, and, self, preservation, freud, noted, that, inhibition, is, one, method, that, the, mind, may, utilize, to, interfere, with, any, of, these, functions, in, order, to, avoid, painful, emotions, hartmann, 1950s, pointed, out, that, there, may, be, delays, or, deficits, in, such, functions, frosch, 1964, described, differences, in, those, people, who, demonstrated, damage, to, their, relationship, to, reality, but, who, seemed, able, to, test, it, according, to, ego, psychology, ego, strengths, later, described, by, otto, f, kernberg, 1975, include, the, capacities, to, control, oral, sexual, and, destructive, impulses, to, tolerate, painful, affects, without, falling, apart, and, to, prevent, the, eruption, into, consciousness, of, bizarre, symbolic, fantasy, synthetic, functions, in, contrast, to, autonomous, functions, arise, from, the, development, of, the, ego, and, serve, the, purpose, of, managing, conflict, processes, defenses, are, synthetic, functions, that, protect, the, conscious, mind, from, awareness, of, forbidden, impulses, and, thoughts, one, purpose, of, ego, psychology, has, been, to, emphasize, that, some, mental, functions, can, be, considered, to, be, basic, rather, than, derivatives, of, wishes, affects, or, defenses, however, autonomous, ego, functions, can, be, secondarily, affected, because, of, unconscious, conflict, for, example, a, patient, may, have, an, hysterical, amnesia, memory, being, an, autonomous, function, because, of, intrapsychic, conflict, wishing, not, to, remember, because, it, is, too, painful, taken, together, the, above, theories, present, a, group, of, metapsychological, assumptions, therefore, the, inclusive, group, of, the, different, classical, theories, provides, a, cross, sectional, view, of, human, mental, processes, there, are, six, points, of, view, five, described, by, freud, and, a, sixth, added, by, hartmann, unconscious, processes, can, therefore, be, evaluated, from, each, of, these, six, points, of, view, modern, conflict, theory, a, variation, of, ego, psychology, is, a, revised, version, of, structural, theory, most, notably, different, by, altering, concepts, related, to, where, repressed, thoughts, were, stored, modern, conflict, theory, addresses, emotional, symptoms, and, character, traits, as, complex, solutions, to, mental, conflict, it, dispenses, with, the, concepts, of, a, fixed, id, ego, and, superego, and, instead, posits, conscious, and, unconscious, conflict, among, wishes, dependent, controlling, sexual, and, aggressive, guilt, and, shame, emotions, especially, anxiety, and, depressive, affect, and, defensive, operations, that, shut, off, from, consciousness, some, aspect, of, the, others, moreover, healthy, functioning, adaptive, is, also, determined, to, a, great, extent, by, resolutions, of, conflict, a, major, objective, of, modern, conflict, theory, psychoanalysis, is, to, change, the, balance, of, conflict, in, a, patient, by, making, aspects, of, the, less, adaptive, solutions, also, called, compromise, formations, conscious, so, that, they, can, be, rethought, and, more, adaptive, solutions, found, current, theoreticians, who, follow, the, work, of, charles, brenner, especially, the, mind, in, conflict, 1982, include, sandor, abend, jacob, arlow, and, jerome, blackman, object, relations, theory, attempts, to, explain, human, relationships, through, a, study, of, how, mental, representations, of, the, self, and, others, are, organized, the, clinical, symptoms, that, suggest, object, relations, problems, typically, developmental, delays, throughout, life, include, disturbances, in, an, individual, s, capacity, to, feel, warmth, empathy, trust, sense, of, security, identity, stability, consistent, emotional, closeness, and, stability, in, relationships, with, significant, others, klein, discusses, the, concept, of, introjection, creating, a, mental, representation, of, external, objects, and, projection, applying, this, mental, representation, to, reality, 24, wilfred, bion, introduced, the, concept, of, containment, of, projections, in, the, mother, child, relationship, where, a, mother, understands, an, infants, projections, modifies, them, and, returns, them, to, the, child, 27, concepts, regarding, internal, representation, aka, introspect, self, and, object, representation, or, internalization, of, self, and, other, although, often, attributed, to, melanie, klein, were, actually, first, mentioned, by, sigmund, freud, in, his, early, concepts, of, drive, theory, three, essays, on, the, theory, of, sexuality, 1905, freud, s, 1917, paper, mourning, and, melancholia, for, example, hypothesized, that, unresolved, grief, was, caused, by, the, survivor, s, internalized, image, of, the, deceased, becoming, fused, with, that, of, the, survivor, and, then, the, survivor, shifting, unacceptable, anger, toward, the, deceased, onto, the, now, complex, self, image, melanie, klein, s, hypotheses, regarding, internalization, during, the, first, year, of, life, leading, to, paranoid, and, depressive, positions, were, later, challenged, by, ren, spitz, e, g, the, first, year, of, life, 1965, who, divided, the, first, year, of, life, into, a, coenesthetic, phase, of, the, first, six, months, and, then, a, diacritic, phase, for, the, second, six, months, mahler, fine, and, bergman, 1975, describe, distinct, phases, and, subphases, of, child, development, leading, to, separation, individuation, during, the, first, three, years, of, life, stressing, the, importance, of, constancy, of,

psychoanalysis, with, structural, linguistics, and, hegelian, philosophy, is, especially, popular, in, france, and, parts, of, latin, america, lacanian, psychoanalysis, is, a, departure, from, the, traditional, british, and, american, psychoanalysis, jacques, lacan, frequently, used, the, phrase, retourner, freud, return, to, freud, in, his, seminars, and, writings, as, he, claimed, that, his, theories, were, an, extension, of, freud, s, own, contrary, to, those, of, anna, freud, the, ego, psychology, object, relations, and, self, theories, and, also, claims, the, necessity, of, reading, freud, s, complete, works, not, only, a, part, of, them, lacan, s, concepts, concern, the, mirror, stage, the, real, the, imaginary, and, the, symbolic, and, the, claim, that, the, unconscious, is, structured, as, a, language, though, a, major, influence, on, psychoanalysis, in, france, and, parts, of, latin, america, lacan, and, his, ideas, have, taken, longer, to, be, translated, into, english, and, he, has, thus, had, a, lesser, impact, on, psychoanalysis, and, psychotherapy, in, the, english, speaking, world, in, the, united, kingdom, and, the, united, states, his, ideas, are, most, widely, used, to, analyze, texts, in, literary, theory, due, to, his, increasingly, critical, stance, towards, the, deviation, from, freud, s, thought, often, singling, out, particular, texts, and, readings, from, his, colleagues, lacan, was, excluded, from, acting, as, a, training, analyst, in, the, ipa, thus, leading, him, to, create, his, own, school, in, order, to, maintain, an, institutional, structure, for, the, many, candidates, who, desired, to, continue, their, analysis, with, him, the, adaptive, paradigm, of, psychotherapy, develops, out, of, the, work, of, robert, langs, the, adaptive, paradigm, interprets, psychic, conflict, primarily, in, terms, of, conscious, and, unconscious, adaptation, to, reality, langs, recent, work, in, some, measure, returns, to, the, earlier, freud, in, that, langs, prefers, a, modified, version, of, the, topographic, model, of, the, mind, conscious, preconscious, and, unconscious, over, the, structural, model, id, ego, and, super, ego, including, the, former, s, emphasis, on, trauma, though, langs, looks, to, death, related, traumas, rather, than, sexual, traumas, at, the, same, time, langs, model, of, the, mind, differs, from, freud, s, in, that, it, understands, the, mind, in, terms, of, evolutionary, biological, principles, relational, psychoanalysis, combines, interpersonal, psychoanalysis, with, object, relations, theory, and, with, inter, subjective, theory, as, critical, for, mental, health, it, was, introduced, by, stephen, mitchell, relational, psychoanalysis, stresses, how, the, individual, s, personality, is, shaped, by, both, real, and, imagined, relationships, with, others, and, how, these, relationship, patterns, are, re, enacted, in, the, interactions, between, analyst, and, patient, relational, psychoanalysts, have, propounded, their, view, of, the, necessity, of, helping, certain, detached, isolated, patients, develop, the, capacity, for, mentalization, associated, with, thinking, about, relationships, and, themselves, freudian, theories, hold, that, adult, problems, can, be, traced, to, unresolved, conflicts, from, certain, phases, of, childhood, and, adolescence, caused, by, fantasy, stemming, from, their, own, drives, freud, based, on, the, data, gathered, from, his, patients, early, in, his, career, suspected, that, neurotic, disturbances, occurred, when, children, were, sexually, abused, in, childhood, i, e, seduction, theory, later, freud, came, to, believe, that, although, child, abuse, occurs, neurotic, symptoms, were, not, associated, with, this, he, believed, that, neurotic, people, often, had, unconscious, conflicts, that, involved, incestuous, fantasies, deriving, from, different, stages, of, development, he, found, the, stage, from, about, three, to, six, years, of, age, preschool, years, today, called, the, first, genital, stage, to, be, filled, with, fantasies, of, having, romantic, relationships, with, both, parents, arguments, were, quickly, generated, in, early, 20th, century, vienna, about, whether, adult, seduction, of, children, i, e, child, sexual, abuse, was, the, basis, of, neurotic, illness, there, still, is, no, complete, agreement, although, nowadays, professionals, recognize, the, negative, effects, of, child, sexual, abuse, on, mental, health, the, theory, on, origins, of, pathologically, dysfunctional, relationships, was, further, developed, by, the, specialist, in, psychiatry, j, rg, willi, 16, march, 1934, in, z, rich, 8, april, 2019, into, the, collusion, psychology, concept, the, concept, takes, the, observations, of, sigmund, freud, about, the, narcissistic, the, oral, the, anal, and, the, phallic, phases, and, translates, them, into, a, two, couples, relationship, model, with, respect, to, dysfunctions, in, the, relationship, resulting, from, childhood, trauma, many, psychoanalysts, who, work, with, children, have, studied, the, actual, effects, of, child, abuse, which, include, ego, and, object, relations, deficits, and, severe, neurotic, conflicts, much, research, has, been, done, on, these, types, of, trauma, in, childhood, and, the, adult, sequelae, of, those, in, studying, the, childhood, factors, that, start, neurotic, symptom, development, freud, found, a, constellation, of, factors, that, for, literary, reasons, he, termed, the, oedipus, complex, based, on, the, play, by, sophocles, oedipus, rex, in, which, the, protagonist, unwittingly, kills, his, father, and, marries, his, mother, the, validity, of, the, oedipus, complex, is, now, widely, disputed, and, rejected, the, shorthand, term, oedipal, later, explicated, by, joseph, j, sandler, in, on, the, concept, superego, 1960, and, modified, by, charles, brenner, in, the, mind, in, conflict, 1982, refers, to, the, powerful, attachments, that, children, make, to, their, parents, in, the, preschool, years, these, attachments, involve, fantasies, of, sexual, relationships, with, either, or, both, parent, and, therefore, competitive, fantasies, toward, either, or, both, parents, humberto, nagera, 1975, has, been, particularly, helpful, in, clarifying, many, of, the, complexities, of, the, child, through, these, years, positive, and, negative, oedipal, conflicts, have, been, attached, to, the, heterosexual, and, homosexual, aspects, respectively, both, seem, to, occur, in, development, of, most, children, eventually, the, developing, child, s, concessions, to, reality, that, they, will, neither, marry, one, parent, nor, eliminate, the, other, lead, to, identifications, with, parental, values, these, identifications, generally, create, a, new, set, of, mental, operations, regarding, values, and, guilt, subsumed, under, the, term, superego, besides, superego, development, children, resolve, their, preschool, oedipal, conflicts, through, channeling, wishes, into, something, their, parents, approve, of, sublimation, and, the, development, during, the, school, age, years, latency, of, age, appropriate, obsessive, compulsive, defensive, maneuvers, rules, repetitive, games, using, the, various, analytic, and, psychological, techniques, to, assess, mental, problems, some, believe, that, there, are, particular, constellations, of, problems, that, are, especially, suited, for, analytic, treatment, see, below, whereas, other, problems, might, respond, better, to, medicines, and, other, interpersonal, interventions, to, be, treated, with, psychoanalysis, whatever, the, presenting, problem, the, person, requesting, help, must, demonstrate, a, desire, to, start, an, analysis, the, person, wishing, to, start, an, analysis, must, have, some, capacity, for, speech, and, communication, as, well, they, need, to, be, able, to, have, or, develop, trust, and, insight, within, the, psychoanalytic, session, potential, patients, must, undergo, a, preliminary, stage, of, treatment, to, assess, their, amenability, to, psychoanalysis, at, that, time, and, also, to, enable, the, analyst, to, form, a, working, psychological, model, which, the, analyst, will, use, to, direct, the, treatment, psychoanalysts, mainly, work, with, neurosis, and, hysteria, in, particular, however, adapted, forms, of, psychoanalysis, are, used, in, working, with, schizophrenia, and, other, forms, of, psychosis, or, mental, disorder, finally, if, a, prospective, patient, is, severely, suicidal, a, longer, preliminary, stage, may, be, employed, sometimes, with, sessions, which, have, a, twenty, minute, break, in, the, middle, there, are, numerous, modifications, in, technique, under, the, heading, of, psychoanalysis, due, to, the, individualistic, nature, of, personality, in, both, analyst, and, patient, the, most, common, problems, treatable, with, psychoanalysis, include, phobias, conversions, compulsions, obsessions, anxiety, attacks, depressions, sexual, dysfunctions, a, wide, variety, of, relationship, problems, such, as, dating, and, marital, strife, and, a, wide, variety, of, character, problems, for, example, painful, shyness, meanness, obnoxiousness, workaholism, hyperseductiveness, hyperemotionality, hyperfastidiousness, the, fact, that, many, of, such, patients, also, demonstrate, deficits, above, makes, diagnosis, and, treatment, selection, difficult, analytical, organizations, such, as, the, ipa, apsaa, and, the, european, federation, for, psychoanalytic, psychotherapy, have, established, procedures, and, models, for, the, indication, and, practice, of, psychoanalytical, therapy, for, trainees, in, analysis, the, match, between, the, analyst, and, the, patient, can, be, viewed, as, another, contributing, factor, for, the, indication, and, contraindication, for, psychoanalytic, treatment, the, analyst, decides, whether, the, patient, is, suitable, for, psychoanalysis, this, decision, made, by, the, analyst, besides, made, on, the, usual, indications, and, pathology, is, also, based, to, a, certain, degree, by, the, fit, between, analyst, and, patient, a, person, s, suitability, for, analysis, at, any, particular, time, is, based, on, their, desire, to, know, something, about, where, their, illness, has, come, from, someone, who, is, not, suitable, for, analysis, expresses, no, desire, to, know, more, about, the, root, causes, of, their, illness, an, evaluation, may, include, one, or, more, other, analysts, independent, opinions, and, will, include, discussion, of, the, patient, s, financial, situation, and, insurances, the, foundation, of, psychoanalysis, is, interpretation, of, the, patient, s, unconscious, conflicts, that, are, interfering, with, current, day, functioning, conflicts, that, are, causing, painful, symptoms, such, as, phobias, anxiety, depression, and, compulsions, strachey, 1936, stressed, that, figuring, out, ways, the, patient, distorted, perceptions, about, the, analyst, led, to, understanding, what, may, have, been, forgotten, in, particular, unconscious, hostile, feelings, toward, the, analyst, could, be, found, in, symbolic, negative, reactions, to, what, robert, langs, later, called, the, frame, of, the, therapy, the, setup, that, included, times, of, the, sessions, payment, of, fees, and, necessity, of, talking, in, patients, who, made, mistakes, forgot, or, showed, other, peculiarities, regarding, time, fees, and, talking, the, analyst, can, usually, find, various, unconscious, resistances, to, the, flow, of, thoughts, aka, free, association, when, the, patient, reclines, on, a, couch, with, the, analyst, out, of, view, the, patient, tends, to, remember, more, experiences, more, resistance, and, transference, and, is, able, to, reorganize, thoughts, after, the, development, of, insight, through, the, interpretive, work, of, the, analyst, although, fantasy, life, can, be, understood, through, the, examination, of, dreams, masturbation, fantasies, are, also, important, the, analyst, is, interested, in, how, the, patient, reacts, to, and, avoids, such, fantasies, various, memories, of, early, life, are, generally, distorted, what, freud, called, screen, memories, and, in, any, case, very, early, experiences, before, age, two, cannot, be, remembered, there, is, what, is, known, among, psychoanalysts, as, classical, technique, although, freud, throughout, his, writings, deviated, from, this, considerably, depending, on, the, problems, of, any, given, patient, classical, technique, was, summarized, by, allan, compton, as, comprising, as, well, the, analyst, can, also, use, confrontation, to, bringing, an, aspect, of, functioning, usually, a, defense, to, the, patient, s, attention, the, analyst, then, uses, a, variety, of, interpretation, methods, such, as, analysts, can, also, use, reconstruction, to, estimate, what, may, have, happened, in, the, past, that, created, some, current, issue, these, techniques, are, primarily, based, on, conflict, theory, see, above, as, object, relations, theory, evolved, supplemented, by, the, work, of, john, bowlby, and, mary, ainsworth, techniques, with, patients, who, had, more, severe, problems, with, basic, trust, erikson, 1950, and, a, history, of, maternal, deprivation, see, the, works, of, augusta, alpert, led, to, new, techniques, with, adults, these, have, sometimes, been, called, interpersonal, intersubjective, cf, stolorow, relational, or, corrective, object, relations, techniques, ego, psychological, concepts, of, deficit, in, functioning, led, to, refinements, in, supportive, therapy, these, techniques, are, particularly, applicable, to, psychotic, and, near, psychotic, cf, eric, marcus, psychosis, and, near, psychosis, patients, these, supportive, therapy, techniques, include, discussions, of, reality, encouragement, to, stay, alive, including, hospitalization, psychotropic, medicines, to, relieve, overwhelming, depressive, affect, or, overwhelming, fantasies, hallucinations, and, delusions, and, advice, about, the, meanings, of, things, to, counter, abstraction, failures, the, notion, of, the, silent, analyst, has, been, criticized, actually, the, analyst, listens, using, arlow, s, approach, as, set, out, in, the, genesis, of, interpretation, using, active, intervention, to, interpret, resistances, defenses, creating, pathology, and, fantasies, silence, is, not, a, technique, of, psychoanalysis, see, also, the, studies, and, opinion, papers, of, owen, renik, analytic, neutrality, is, a, concept, that, does, not, mean, the, analyst, is, silent, it, refers, to, the, analyst, s, position, of, not, taking, sides, in, the, internal, struggles, of, the, patient, for, example, if, a, patient, feels, guilty, the, analyst, might, explore, what, the, patient, has, been, doing, or, thinking, that, causes, the, guilt, but, not, reassure, the, patient, not, to, feel, guilty, the, analyst, might, also, explore, the, identifications, with, parents, and, others, that, led, to, the, guilt, interpersonal, relational, psychoanalysts, emphasize, the, notion, that, it, is, impossible, to, be, neutral, sullivan, introduced, the, term, participant, observer, to, indicate, the, analyst, inevitably, interacts, with, the, analysand, and, suggested, the, detailed, inquiry, as, an, alternative, to, interpretation, the, detailed, inquiry, involves, noting, where, the, analysand, is, leaving, out, important, elements, of, an, account, and, noting, when, the, story, is, obfuscated, and, asking, careful, questions, to, open, up, the, dialogue, although, single, client, sessions, remain, the, norm, psychoanalytic, theory, has, been, used, to, develop, other, types, of, psychological, treatment, psychoanalytic, group, therapy, was, pioneered, by, trigant, burrow, joseph, pratt, paul, f, schilder, samuel, r, slavson, harry, stack, sullivan, and, wolfe, child, centered, counseling, for, parents, was, instituted, early, in, analytic, history, by, freud, and, was, later, further, developed, by, irwin, marcus, edith, schulhofer, and, gilbert, kliman, psychoanalytically, based, couples, therapy, has, been, promulgated, and, explicated, by, fred, sander, techniques, and, tools, developed, in, the, first, decade, of, the, 21st, century, have, made, psychoanalysis, available, to, patients, who, were, not, treatable, by, earlier, techniques, this, meant, that, the, analytic, situation, was, modified, so, that, it, would, be, more, suitable, and, more, likely, to, be, helpful, for, these, patients, eagle, 2007, believes, that, psychoanalysis, cannot, be, a, self, contained, discipline, but, instead, must, be, open, to, influence, from, and, integration, with, findings, and, theory, from, other, disciplines, psychoanalytic, constructs, have, been, adapted, for, use, with, children, with, treatments, such, as, play, therapy, art, therapy, and, storytelling, throughout, her, career, from, the, 1920s, through, the, 1970s, anna, freud, adapted, psychoanalysis, for, children, through, play, this, is, still, used, today, for, children, especially, those, who, are, preadolescent, using, toys, and, games, children, are, able, to, symbolically, demonstrate, their, fears, fantasies, and, defenses, although, not, identical, this, technique, in, children, is, analogous, to, the, aim, of, free, association, in, adults, psychoanalytic, play, therapy, allows, the, child, and, analyst, to, understand, children, s, conflicts, particularly, defenses, such, as, disobedience, and, withdrawal, that, have, been, guarding, against, various, unpleasant, feelings, and, hostile, wishes, in, art, therapy, the, counselor, may, have, a, child, draw, a, portrait, and, then, tell, a, story, about, the, portrait, the, counselor, watches, for, recurring, themes, regardless, of, whether, it, is, with, art, or, toys, psychoanalysis, can, be, adapted, to, different, cultures, as, long, as, the, therapist, or, counselor, understands, the, client, s, culture, for, example, tori, and, blimes, found, that, defense, mechanisms, were, valid, in, a, normative, sample, of, 2, 624, thais, the, use, of, certain, defense, mechanisms, was, related, to, cultural, values, for, example, thais, value, calmness, and, collectiveness, because, of, buddhist, beliefs, so, they, were, low, on, regressive, emotionality, psychoanalysis, also, applies, because, freud, used, techniques, that, allowed, him, to, get, the, subjective, perceptions, of, his, patients, he, takes, an, objective, approach, by, not, facing, his, clients, during, his, talk, therapy, sessions, he, met, with, his, patients, wherever, they, were, such, as, when, he, used, free, association, where, clients, would, say, whatever, came, to, mind, without, self, censorship, his, treatments, had, little, to, no, structure, for, most, cultures, especially, asian, cultures, therefore, it, is, more, likely, that, freudian, constructs, will, be, used, in, structured, therapy, in, addition, corey, postulates, that, it, will, be, necessary, for, a, therapist, to, help, clients, develop, a, cultural, identity, as, well, as, an, ego, identity, psychodynamic, therapies, refer, therapies, that, draw, from, psychoanalytic, approaches, but, are, designed, to, be, shorter, in, duration, or, less, intensive, 1, the, cost, to, the, patient, of, psychoanalytic, treatment, ranges, widely, from, place, to, place, and, between, practitioners, low, fee, analysis, is, often, available, in, a, psychoanalytic, training, clinic, and, graduate, schools, otherwise, the, fee, set, by, each, analyst, varies, with, the, analyst, s, training, and, experience, since, in, most, locations, in, the, united, states, unlike, in, ontario, and, germany, classical, analysis, which, usually, requires, sessions, three, to, five, times, per, week, is, not, covered, by, health, insurance, many, analysts, may, negotiate, their, fees, with, patients, whom, they, feel, they, can, help, but, who, have, financial, difficulties, the, modifications, of, analysis, which, include, psychodynamic, therapy, brief, therapies, and, certain, types, of, group, therapy, are, carried, out, on, a, less, frequent, basis, usually, once, twice, or, three, times, a, week, and, usually, the, patient, sits, facing, the, therapist, as, a, result, of, the, defense, mechanisms, and, the, lack, of, access, to, the, unfathomable, elements, of, the, unconscious, psychoanalysis, can, be, an, expansive, process, that, involves, 2, to, 5, sessions, per, week, for, several, years, this, type, of, therapy, relies, on, the, belief, that, reducing, the, symptoms, will, not, actually, help, with, the, root, causes, or, irrational, drives, the, analyst, typically, is, a, blank, screen, disclosing, very, little, about, themselves, in, order, that, the, client, can, use, the, space, in, the, relationship, to, work, on, their, unconscious, without, interference, from, outside, the, psychoanalyst, uses, various, methods, to, help, the, patient, to, become, more, self, aware, insightful, and, uncover, meanings, of, symptoms, firstly, the, psychoanalyst, attempts, to, develop, a, safe, and, confidential, atmosphere, where, the, patient, can, report, feelings, thoughts, and, fantasies, analysands, as, people, in, analysis, are, called, are, asked, to, report, whatever, comes, to, mind, without, fear, of, reprisal, freud, called, this, the, fundamental, rule, analysands, are, asked, to, talk, about, their, lives, including, their, early, life, current, life, and, hopes, and, aspirations, for, the, future, they, are, encouraged, to, report, their, fantasies, flash, thoughts, and, dreams, in, fact, freud, believed, that, dreams, were, the, royal, road, to, the, unconscious, he, devoted, an, entire, volume, to, the, interpretation, of, dreams, freud, had, his, patients, lay, on, a, couch, in, a, dimly, lit, room, and, would, sit, out, of, sight, usually, directly, behind, them, as, to, not, influence, the, patient, s, thoughts, by, his, gestures, or, expressions, the, psychoanalyst, s, task, in, collaboration, with, the, analysand, is, to, help, deepen, the, analysand, s, understanding, of, those, factors, outside, of, his, awareness, that, drive, his, behaviors, in, the, safe, environment, psychoanalysis, offers, the, analysand, becomes, attached, to, the, analyst, and, pretty, soon, he, begins, to, experience, the, same, conflicts, with, his, analyst, that, he, experiences, with, key, figures, in, his, life, such, as, his, parents, his, boss, his, significant, other, etc, it, is, the, psychoanalyst, s, role, to, point, out, these, conflicts, and, to, interpret, them, the, transferring, of, these, internal, conflicts, onto, the, analyst, is, called, transference, many, studies, have, also, been, done, on, briefer, dynamic, treatments, these, are, more, expedient, to, measure, and, shed, light, on, the, therapeutic, process, to, some, extent, brief, relational, therapy, brt, brief, psychodynamic, therapy, bpt, and, time, limited, dynamic, therapy, tldp, limit, treatment, to, 20, 30, sessions, on, average, classical, analysis, may, last, 5,

training, in, the, united, states, tends, to, vary, according, to, the, program, but, it, involves, a, personal, psychoanalysis, for, the, trainee, approximately, 300, to, 600, hours, of, class, instruction, with, a, standard, curriculum, over, a, two, to, five, year, period, typically, this, psychoanalysis, must, be, conducted, by, a, supervising, and, training, analyst, most, institutes, but, not, all, within, the, american, psychoanalytic, association, require, that, supervising, and, training, analysts, become, certified, by, the, american, board, of, psychoanalysts, certification, entails, a, blind, review, in, which, the, psychoanalyst, s, work, is, vetted, by, psychoanalysts, outside, of, their, local, community, after, earning, certification, these, psychoanalysts, undergo, another, hurdle, in, which, they, are, specially, vetted, by, senior, members, of, their, own, institute, and, held, to, the, highest, ethical, and, moral, standards, moreover, they, are, required, to, have, extensive, experience, conducting, psychoanalyses, candidates, generally, have, an, hour, of, supervision, each, week, per, psychoanalytic, case, the, minimum, number, of, cases, varies, between, institutes, candidates, often, have, two, to, four, cases, both, male, and, female, cases, are, required, supervision, extends, at, least, a, few, years, on, one, or, more, cases, during,

any, psychoanalytic, journal, there, are, different, forms, of, psychoanalysis, and, psychotherapies, in, which, psychoanalytic, thinking, is, practiced, besides, classical, psychoanalysis, there, is, for, example, psychoanalytic, psychotherapy, a, therapeutic, approach, which, widens, the, accessibility, of, psychoanalytic, theory, and, clinical, practices, that, had, evolved, over, 100, plus, years, to, a, larger, number, of, individuals, other, examples, of, well, known, therapies, which, also, use, insights, of, psychoanalysis, are, mentalization, based, treatment, mbt, and, transference, focused, psychotherapy, tfp, there, is, also, a, continuing, influence, of, psychoanalytic, thinking, in, mental, health, care, and, psychiatric, care, over, a, hundred, years, of, case, reports, and, studies, in, the, journal, modern, psychoanalysis, the, psychoanalytic, quarterly, the, international, journal, of, psychoanalysis, and, the, journal, of, the, american, psychoanalytic, association, have, analyzed, the, efficacy, of, analysis, in, cases, of, neurosis, and, character, or, personality, problems, psychoanalysis, modified, by, object, relations, techniques, has, been, shown, to, be, effective, in, many, cases, of, ingrained, problems, of, intimacy, and, relationship, cf, the, many, books, of, otto, kernberg, psychoanalytic, treatment, in, other, situations, may, run, from, about, a, year, to, many, years, depending, on, the, severity, and, complexity, of, the, pathology, psychoanalytic, theory, has, from, its, inception, been, the, subject, of, criticism, and, controversy, freud, remarked, on, this, early, in, his, career, when, other, physicians, in, vienna, ostracized, him, for, his, findings, that, hysterical, conversion, symptoms, were, not, limited, to, women, challenges, to, analytic, theory, began, with, otto, rank, and, alfred, adler, turn, of, the, 20th, century, continued, with, behaviorists, e, g, wolpe, into, the, 1940s, and, 50s, and, have, persisted, e, g, miller, criticisms, come, from, those, who, object, to, the, notion, that, there, are, mechanisms, thoughts, or, feelings, in, the, mind, that, could, be, unconscious, criticisms, also, have, been, leveled, against, the, idea, of, infantile, sexuality, the, recognition, that, children, between, ages, two, and, six, imagine, things, about, procreation, criticisms, of, theory, have, led, to, variations, in, analytic, theories, such, as, the, work, of, ronald, fairbairn, michael, balint, and, john, bowlby, in, the, past, 30, years, or, so, the, criticisms, have, centered, on, the, issue, of, empirical, verification, with, it, being, difficult, to, substantiate, the, efficacy, of, psychoanalytic, treatments, in, a, psychiatric, context, psychoanalysis, has, been, used, as, a, research, tool, into, childhood, development, cf, the, journal, the, psychoanalytic, study, of, the, child, and, has, developed, into, a, flexible, effective, treatment, for, certain, mental, disturbances, in, the, 1960s, freud, s, early, 1905, thoughts, on, the, childhood, development, of, female, sexuality, were, challenged, this, challenge, led, to, major, research, in, the, 1970s, and, 80s, and, then, to, a, reformulation, of, female, sexual, development, that, corrected, some, of, freud, s, concepts, also, see, the, various, works, of, eleanor, galenson, nancy, chodorow, karen, horney, fran, oise, dolto, melanie, klein, selma, fraiberg, and, others, most, recently, psychoanalytic, researchers, who, have, integrated, attachment, theory, into, their, work, including, alicia, lieberman, and, daniel, schechter, have, explored, the, role, of, parental, traumatization, in, the, development, of, young, children, s, mental, representations, of, self, and, others, the, psychoanalytic, profession, has, been, resistant, to, researching, efficacy, evaluations, of, effectiveness, based, on, the, interpretation, of, the, therapist, alone, cannot, be, proven, numerous, studies, have, shown, that, the, efficacy, of, therapy, is, primarily, related, to, the, quality, of, the, therapeutic, alliance, meta, analyses, in, 2019, found, psychoanalytic, and, psychodynamic, therapy, effective, at, improving, psychosocial, wellbeing, reducing, suicidality, as, well, as, self, harm, behavior, in, patients, at, a, 6, month, interval, there, has, also, been, evidence, for, psychoanalytic, psychotherapy, as, an, effective, treatment, for, attention, deficit, hyperactivity, disorder, adhd, and, conduct, disorder, when, compared, with, behavioral, management, treatments, with, or, without, methylphenidate, meta, analysis, in, 2012, and, 2013, found, support, or, evidence, for, the, efficacy, of, psychoanalytic, therapy, other, meta, analyses, published, in, recent, years, showed, psychoanalysis, and, psychodynamic, therapy, to, be, effective, with, outcomes, comparable, to, or, greater, than, other, kinds, of, psychotherapy, or, antidepressant, drugs, but, these, meta, analyses, have, been, subjected, to, various, criticisms, in, particular, the, inclusion, of, pre, post, studies, rather, than, randomized, controlled, trials, and, the, absence, of, adequate, comparisons, with, control, treatments, is, a, serious, limitation, in, interpreting, the, results, a, french, 2004, report, from, inserm, concluded, that, psychoanalytic, therapy, is, less, effective, than, other, psychotherapies, including, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, for, certain, diseases, in, 2011, the, american, psychological, association, reviewed, 103, rct, comparisons, between, psychodynamic, treatment, and, a, non, dynamic, competitor, which, had, been, published, between, 1974, and, 2010, and, among, which, 63, were, deemed, of, adequate, quality, out, of, 39, comparisons, with, an, active, competitor, they, found, that, 6, psychodynamic, treatments, were, superior, 5, were, inferior, and, 28, showed, no, difference, the, study, found, these, results, promising, but, explicited, the, necessity, of, further, good, quality, trials, replicating, positive, results, on, specific, disorders, meta, analyses, of, short, term, psychodynamic, psychotherapy, stpp, have, found, effect, sizes, cohen, s, d, ranging, from, 0, 34, to, 0, 71, compared, to, no, treatment, and, was, found, to, be, slightly, better, than, other,

depression, overall, istdp, had, an, effect, size, of, 1, 18, compared, to, no, treatment, a, meta, analysis, of, long, term, psychodynamic, psychotherapy, in, 2012, found, an, overall, effect, size, of, 0, 33, which, is, modest, this, study, concluded, the, recovery, rate, following, ltpp, was, equal, to, control, treatments, including, treatment, as, usual, and, found, the, evidence, for, the, effectiveness, of, ltpp, to, be, limited, and, at, best, conflicting, others, have, found, effect, sizes, of, 0, 44, 0, 68, according, to, a, 2004, french, review, conducted, by, inserm, psychoanalysis, was, presumed, or, proven, effective, at, treating, panic, disorder, post, traumatic, stress, and, personality, disorders, but, did, not, find, evidence, of, its, effectiveness, in, treating, schizophrenia, obsessive, compulsive, disorder, specific, phobia, bulimia, and, anorexia, a, 2001, systematic, review, of, the, medical, literature, by, the, cochrane, collaboration, concluded, that, no, data, exist, demonstrating, that, psychodynamic, psychotherapy, is, effective, in, treating, schizophrenia, and, severe, mental, illness, and, cautioned, that, medication, should, always, be, used, alongside, any, type, of, talk, therapy, in, schizophrenia, cases, a, french, review, from, 2004, found, the, same, the, schizophrenia, patient, outcomes, research, team, advises, against, the, use, of, psychodynamic, therapy, in, cases, of, schizophrenia, arguing, that, more, trials, are, necessary, to, verify, its, effectiveness, both, freud, and, psychoanalysis, have, been, criticized, in, extreme, terms, exchanges, between, critics, and, defenders, of, psychoanalysis, have, often, been, so, heated, that, they, have, come, to, be, characterized, as, the, freud, wars, linguist, noam, chomsky, has, criticized, psychoanalysis, for, lacking, a, scientific, basis, evolutionary, biologist, stephen, jay, gould, considered, psychoanalysis, influenced, by, pseudoscientific, theories, such, as, recapitulation, theory, psychologists, hans, eysenck, john, f, kihlstrom, and, others, have, also, criticized, the, field, as, pseudoscience, the, theoretical, foundations, of, psychoanalysis, lie, in, the, same, philosophical, currents, that, lead, to, interpretive, phenomenology, rather, than, in, those, that, lead, to, scientific, positivism, making, the, theory, largely, incompatible, with, positivist, approaches, to, the, study, of, the, mind, early, critics, of, psychoanalysis, believed, that, its, theories, were, based, too, little, on, quantitative, and, experimental, research, and, too, much, on, the, clinical, case, study, method, philosopher, frank, cioffi, cites, false, claims, of, a, sound, scientific, verification, of, the, theory, and, its, elements, as, the, strongest, basis, for, classifying, the, work, of, freud, and, his, school, as, pseudoscience, karl, popper, argued, that, psychoanalysis, is, a, pseudoscience, because, its, claims, are, not, testable, and, cannot, be, refuted, that, is, they, are, not, falsifiable, those, clinical, observations, which, analysts, naively, believe, confirm, their, theory, cannot, do, this, any, more, than, the, daily, confirmations, which, astrologers, find, in, their, practice, and, as, for, freud, s, epic, of, the, ego, the, super, ego, and, the, id, no, substantially, stronger, claim, to, scientific, status, can, be, made, for, it, than, for, homer, s, collected, stories, from, the, olympus, in, addition, imre, lakatos, wrote, that, freudians, have, been, nonplussed, by, popper, s, basic, challenge, concerning, scientific, honesty, indeed, they, have, refused, to, specify, experimental, conditions, under, which, they, would, give, up, their, basic, assumptions, in, sexual, desire, 1986, philosopher, roger, scruton, rejects, popper, s, arguments, pointing, to, the, theory, of, repression, as, an, example, of, a, freudian, theory, that, does, have, testable, consequences, scruton, nevertheless, concluded, that, psychoanalysis, is, not, genuinely, scientific, on, the, grounds, that, it, involves, an, unacceptable, dependence, on, metaphor, the, philosopher, and, physicist, mario, bunge, argued, that, psychoanalysis, is, a, pseudoscience, because, it, violates, the, ontology, and, methodology, inherent, to, science, according, to, bunge, most, psychoanalytic, theories, are, either, untestable, or, unsupported, by, evidence, cognitive, scientists, in, particular, have, also, weighed, in, martin, seligman, a, prominent, academic, in, positive, psychology, wrote, that, thirty, years, ago, the, cognitive, revolution, in, psychology, overthrew, both, freud, and, the, behaviorists, at, least, in, academia, the, imperialistic, freudian, view, claims, that, emotion, always, drives, thought, while, the, imperialistic, cognitive, view, claims, that, thought, always, drives, emotion, the, evidence, however, is, that, each, drives, the, other, at, times, adolf, gr, nbaum, argues, in, validation, in, the, clinical, theory, of, psychoanalysis, 1993, that, psychoanalytic, based, theories, are, falsifiable, but, that, the, causal, claims, of, psychoanalysis, are, unsupported, by, the, available, clinical, evidence, historian, henri, ellenberger, who, researched, the, history, of, freud, jung, adler, and, janet, 20, while, writing, his, book, the, discovery, of, the, unconscious, the, history, and, evolution, of, dynamic, psychiatry, 17, argued, that, psychoanalysis, was, not, scientific, on, the, grounds, of, both, its, methodology, and, social, structure, 21, psychoanalysis, is, it, a, science, it, does, not, meet, the, criteria, unified, science, defined, domain, and, methodology, it, corresponds, to, the, traits, of, a, philosophical, sect, closed, organisation, highly, personal, initiation, a, doctrine, which, is, changeable, but, defined, by, its, official, adoption, cult, and, legend, of, the, founder, some, have, accused, freud, of, fabrication, most, famously, in, the, case, of, anna, o, others, have, speculated, that, patients, had, conditions, that, are, now, easily, identifiable, and, unrelated, to, psychoanalysis, for, instance, anna, o, is, thought, to, have, had, an, organic, impairment, such, as, tuberculous, meningitis, or, temporal, lobe, epilepsy, rather, than, freud, s, diagnosis, of, hysteria, henri, ellenberger, and, frank, sulloway, argue, that, freud, and, his, followers, created, an, inaccurate, legend, of, freud, to, popularize, psychoanalysis, 12, mikkel, borch, jacobsen, and, sonu, shamdasani, argue, that, this, legend, has, been, adapted, to, different, times, and, situations, 13, isabelle, stengers, states, that, psychoanalytic, circles, have, tried, to, stop, historians, from, accessing, documents, about, the, life, of, freud, 32, richard, feynman, wrote, off, psychoanalysts, as, mere, witch, doctors, if, you, look, at, all, of, the, complicated, ideas, that, they, have, developed, in, an, infinitesimal, amount, of, time, if, you, compare, to, any, other, of, the, sciences, how, long, it, takes, to, get, one, idea, after, the, other, if, you, consider, all, the, structures, and, inventions, and, complicated, things, the, ids, and, the, egos, the, tensions, and, the, forces, and, the, pushes, and, the, pulls, i, tell, you, they, can, t, all, be, there, it, s, too, much, for, one, brain, or, a, few, brains, to, have, cooked, up, in, such, a, short, time, likewise, psychiatrist, e, fuller, torrey, in, witchdoctors, and, psychiatrists, 1986, agreed, that, psychoanalytic, theories, have, no, more, scientific, basis, than, the, theories, of, traditional, native, healers, witchdoctors, or, modern, cult, alternatives, such, as, est, psychologist, alice, miller, charged, psychoanalysis, with, being, similar, to, the, poisonous, pedagogies, which, she, described, in, her, book, for, your, own, good, she, scrutinized, and, rejected, the, validity, of, freud, s, drive, theory, including, the, oedipus, complex, which, according, to, her, and, jeffrey, masson, blames, the, child, for, the, abusive, sexual, behavior, of, adults, psychologist, joel, kupfersmid, investigated, the, validity, of, the, oedipus, complex, examining, its, nature, and, origins, he, concluded, that, there, is, little, evidence, to, support, the, existence, of, the, oedipus, complex, contemporary, french, philosophers, michel, foucault, and, gilles, deleuze, asserted, that, the, institution, of, psychoanalysis, has, become, a, center, of, power, and, that, its, confessional, techniques, resemble, those, included, and, utilized, within, the, christian, religion, french, psychoanalyst, jacques, lacan, criticized, the, emphasis, of, some, american, and, british, psychoanalytical, traditions, on, what, he, has, viewed, as, the, suggestion, of, imaginary, causes, for, symptoms, and, recommended, the, return, to, freud, belgian, psycholinguist, and, psychoanalyst, luce, irigaray, also, criticized, psychoanalysis, employing, jacques, derrida, s, concept, of, phallogocentrism, to, describe, the, exclusion, of, the, woman, both, from, freudian, and, lacanian, psychoanalytical, theories, together, with, deleuze, the, french, psychoanalyst, and, psychiatrist, f, lix, guattari, criticized, the, oedipal, and, schizophrenic, power, structure, of, psychoanalysis, and, its, connivance, with, capitalism, in, anti, oedipus, 1972, and, a, thousand, plateaus, 1980, the, two, volumes, of, their, theoretical, work, capitalism, and, schizophrenia, deleuze, and, guattari, in, anti, oedipus, take, the, cases, of, g, rard, mendel, bela, grunberger, and, janine, chasseguet, smirgel, prominent, members, of, the, most, respected, psychoanalytical, associations, including, the, ipa, to, suggest, that, traditionally, psychoanalysis, had, always, enthusiastically, enjoyed, and, embraced, a, police, state, throughout, its, history, many, aspects, of, freudian, theory, are, indeed, out, of, date, and, they, should, be, freud, died, in, 1939, and, he, has, been, slow, to, undertake, further, revisions, his, critics, however, are, equally, behind, the, times, attacking, freudian, views, of, the, 1920s, as, if, they, continue, to, have, some, currency, in, their, original, form, psychodynamic, theory, and, therapy, have, evolved, considerably, since, 1939, when, freud, s, bearded, countenance, was, last, sighted, in, earnest, contemporary, psychoanalysts, and, psychodynamic, therapists, no, longer, write, much, about, ids, and, egos, nor, do, they, conceive, of, treatment, for, psychological, disorders, as, an, archaeological, expedition, in, search, of, lost, memories, drew, westen, 1998, a, survey, of, scientific, research, suggested, that, while, personality, traits, corresponding, to, freud, s, oral, anal, oedipal, and, genital, phases, can, be, observed, they, do, not, necessarily, manifest, as, stages, in, the, development, of, children, these, studies, also, have, not, confirmed, that, such, traits, in, adults, result, from, childhood, experiences, however, these, stages, should, not, be, viewed, as, crucial, to, modern, psychoanalysis, what, is, crucial, to, modern, psychoanalytic, theory, and, practice, is, the, power, of, the, unconscious, and, the, transference, phenomenon, the, idea, of, unconscious, is, contested, because, human, behavior, can, be, observed, while, human, mental, activity, has, to, be, inferred, however, the, unconscious, is, now, a, popular, topic, of, study, in, the, fields, of, experimental, and, social, psychology, e, g, implicit, attitude, measures, fmri, and, pet, scans, and, other, indirect, tests, the, idea, of, unconscious, and, the, transference, phenomenon, have, been, widely, researched, and, it, is, claimed, validated, in, the, fields, of, cognitive, psychology, and, social, psychology, though, a, freudian, interpretation, of, unconscious, mental, activity, is, not, held, by, the, majority, of, cognitive, psychologists, recent, developments, in, neuroscience, have, resulted, in, one, side, arguing, that, it, has, provided, a, biological, basis, for, unconscious, emotional, processing, in, line, with, psychoanalytic, theory, i, e, neuropsychoanalysis, while, the, other, side, argues, that, such, findings, make, psychoanalytic, theory, obsolete, and, irrelevant, shlomo, kalo, explains, that, the, scientific, materialism, that, flourished, in, the, 19th, century, severely, harmed, religion, and, rejected, whatever, called, spiritual, the, institution, of, the, confession, priest, in, particular, was, badly, damaged, the, empty, void, that, this, institution, left, behind, was, swiftly, occupied, by, the, newborn, psychoanalysis, in, his, writings, kalo, claims, that, psychoanalysis, basic, approach, is, erroneous, it, represents, the, mainline, wrong, assumptions, that, happiness, is, unreachable, and, that, the, natural, desire, of, a, human, being, is, to, exploit, his, fellow, men, for, his, own, pleasure, and, benefit, jacques, derrida, incorporated, aspects, of, psychoanalytic, theory, into, his, theory, of, deconstruction, in, order, to, question, what, he, called, the, metaphysics, of, presence, derrida, also, turns, some, of, these, ideas, against, freud, to, reveal, tensions, and, contradictions, in, his, work, for, example, although, freud, defines, religion, and, metaphysics, as, displacements, of, the, identification, with, the, father, in, the, resolution, of, the, oedipal, complex, derrida, 1987, insists, that, the, prominence, of, the, father, in, freud, s, own, analysis, is, itself, indebted, to, the, prominence, given, to, the, father, in, western, metaphysics, and, theology, since, plato
