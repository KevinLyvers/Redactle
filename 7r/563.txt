the, geneva, conventions, are, international, humanitarian, laws, consisting, of, four, treaties, and, three, additional, protocols, that, establish, international, legal, standards, for, humanitarian, treatment, in, war, the, singular, term, geneva, convention, colloquially, denotes, the, agreements, of, 1949, negotiated, in, the, aftermath, of, the, second, world, war, 1939, 1945, which, updated, the, terms, of, the, two, 1929, treaties, and, added, two, new, conventions, the, geneva, conventions, extensively, define, the, basic, rights, of, wartime, prisoners, civilians, and, military, personnel, establish, protections, for, the, wounded, and, sick, and, provide, protections, for, the, civilians, in, and, around, a, war, zone, the, geneva, conventions, define, the, rights, and, protections, afforded, to, non, combatants, who, fulfill, the, criteria, of, being, protected, persons, the, treaties, of, 1949, were, ratified, in, their, entirety, or, with, reservations, by, 196, countries, the, geneva, conventions, concern, only, protected, non, combatants, in, war, the, use, of, wartime, conventional, weapons, is, addressed, by, the, hague, conventions, of, 1899, and, 1907, and, the, 1980, convention, on, certain, conventional, weapons, while, the, biological, and, chemical, warfare, in, international, armed, conflicts, is, addressed, by, the, 1925, geneva, protocol, the, swiss, businessman, henry, dunant, went, to, visit, wounded, soldiers, after, the, battle, of, solferino, in, 1859, he, was, shocked, by, the, lack, of, facilities, personnel, and, medical, aid, available, to, help, these, soldiers, as, a, result, he, published, his, book, a, memory, of, solferino, in, 1862, on, the, horrors, of, war, his, wartime, experiences, inspired, dunant, to, propose, the, former, proposal, led, to, the, establishment, of, the, red, cross, in, geneva, the, latter, led, to, the, 1864, geneva, convention, the, first, codified, international, treaty, that, covered, the, sick, and, wounded, soldiers, on, the, battlefield, on, 22, august, 1864, the, swiss, government, invited, the, governments, of, all, european, countries, as, well, as, the, united, states, brazil, and, mexico, to, attend, an, official, diplomatic, conference, sixteen, countries, sent, a, total, of, twenty, six, delegates, to, geneva, on, 22, august, 1864, the, conference, adopted, the, first, geneva, convention, for, the, amelioration, of, the, condition, of, the, wounded, in, armies, in, the, field, representatives, of, 12, states, and, kingdoms, signed, the, convention, for, both, of, these, accomplishments, henry, dunant, became, co, recipient, of, the, first, nobel, peace, prize, in, 1901, on, 20, october, 1868, the, first, unsuccessful, attempt, to, expand, the, 1864, treaty, was, undertaken, with, the, additional, articles, relating, to, the, condition, of, the, wounded, in, war, an, attempt, was, initiated, to, clarify, some, rules, of, the, 1864, convention, and, to, extend, them, to, maritime, warfare, the, articles, were, signed, but, were, only, ratified, by, the, netherlands, and, the, united, states, of, america, the, netherlands, later, withdrew, their, ratification, the, protection, of, the, victims, of, maritime, warfare, would, later, be, realized, by, the, third, hague, convention, of, 1899, and, the, tenth, hague, convention, of, 1907, in, 1906, thirty, five, states, attended, a, conference, convened, by, the, swiss, government, on, 6, july, 1906, it, resulted, in, the, adoption, of, the, convention, for, the, amelioration, of, the, condition, of, the, wounded, and, sick, in, armies, in, the, field, which, improved, and, supplemented, for, the, first, time, the, 1864, convention, it, remained, in, force, until, 1970, when, costa, rica, acceded, to, the, 1949, geneva, conventions, the, 1929, conference, yielded, two, conventions, that, were, signed, on, 27, july, 1929, one, the, convention, for, the, amelioration, of, the, condition, of, the, wounded, and, sick, in, armies, in, the, field, was, the, third, version, to, replace, the, original, convention, of, 1864, the, other, was, adopted, after, experiences, in, world, war, i, had, shown, the, deficiencies, in, the, protection, of, prisoners, of, war, under, the, hague, conventions, of, 1899, and, 1907, the, convention, relative, to, the, treatment, of, prisoners, of, war, was, not, to, replace, these, earlier, conventions, signed, at, the, hague, rather, it, supplemented, them, there, was, considerable, debate, over, whether, the, geneva, convention, should, prohibit, indiscriminate, forms, of, warfare, such, as, aerial, bombings, nuclear, bombings, and, starvation, but, no, agreement, was, reached, on, those, forms, of, violence, inspired, by, the, wave, of, humanitarian, and, pacifistic, enthusiasm, following, world, war, ii, and, the, outrage, towards, the, war, crimes, disclosed, by, the, nuremberg, and, tokyo, trials, a, series, of, conferences, were, held, in, 1949, reaffirming, expanding, and, updating, the, prior, geneva, and, hague, conventions, it, yielded, four, distinct, conventions, despite, the, length, of, these, documents, they, were, found, over, time, to, be, incomplete, the, nature, of, armed, conflicts, had, changed, with, the, beginning, of, the, cold, war, era, leading, many, to, believe, that, the, 1949, geneva, conventions, were, addressing, a, largely, extinct, reality, on, the, one, hand, most, armed, conflicts, had, become, internal, or, civil, wars, while, on, the, other, most, wars, had, become, increasingly, asymmetric, modern, armed, conflicts, were, inflicting, an, increasingly, higher, toll, on, civilians, which, brought, the, need, to, provide, civilian, persons, and, objects, with, tangible, protections, in, time, of, combat, bringing, a, much, needed, update, to, the, hague, conventions, of, 1899, and, 1907, in, light, of, these, developments, two, protocols, were, adopted, in, 1977, that, extended, the, terms, of, the, 1949, conventions, with, additional, protections, in, 2005, a, third, brief, protocol, was, added, establishing, an, additional, protective, sign, for, medical, services, the, red, crystal, as, an, alternative, to, the, ubiquitous, red, cross, and, red, crescent, emblems, for, those, countries, that, find, them, objectionable, the, geneva, conventions, of, 12, august, 1949, commentary, the, commentaries, is, a, series, of, four, volumes, of, books, published, between, 1952, and, 1958, and, containing, commentaries, to, each, of, the, four, geneva, conventions, the, series, was, edited, by, jean, pictet, who, was, the, vice, president, of, the, international, committee, of, the, red, cross, the, commentaries, are, often, relied, upon, to, provide, authoritative, interpretation, of, the, articles, the, geneva, conventions, are, rules, that, apply, only, in, times, of, armed, conflict, and, seek, to, protect, people, who, are, not, or, are, no, longer, taking, part, in, hostilities, the, first, convention, dealt, with, the, treatment, of, wounded, and, sick, armed, forces, in, the, field, the, second, convention, dealt, with, the, sick, wounded, and, shipwrecked, members, of, armed, forces, at, sea, the, third, convention, dealt, with, the, treatment, of, prisoners, of, war, during, times, of, conflict, the, fourth, convention, dealt, with, the, treatment, of, civilians, and, their, protection, during, wartime, individuals, who, fulfill, the, criteria, of, protected, persons, in, international, armed, conflicts, are, protected, by, the, 1949, conventions, those, not, listed, as, protected, persons, in, such, conflicts, are, instead, protected, by, international, human, rights, law, and, general, treaties, concerning, the, legal, status, of, aliens, in, belligerent, nations, in, international, law, and, diplomacy, the, term, convention, refers, to, an, international, agreement, or, treaty, with, two, geneva, conventions, revised, and, adopted, and, the, second, and, fourth, added, in, 1949, the, whole, set, is, referred, to, as, the, geneva, conventions, of, 1949, or, simply, the, geneva, conventions, usually, only, the, geneva, conventions, of, 1949, are, referred, to, as, first, second, third, or, fourth, geneva, convention, the, treaties, of, 1949, were, ratified, in, whole, or, with, reservations, by, 196, countries, the, 1949, conventions, have, been, modified, with, three, amendment, protocols, the, geneva, conventions, apply, at, times, of, war, and, armed, conflict, to, governments, who, have, ratified, its, terms, the, details, of, applicability, are, spelled, out, in, common, articles, 2, and, 3, this, article, states, that, the, geneva, conventions, apply, to, all, the, cases, of, international, armed, conflict, iac, where, at, least, one, of, the, warring, nations, has, ratified, the, conventions, primarily, article, 1, of, protocol, i, further, clarifies, that, armed, conflict, against, colonial, domination, and, foreign, occupation, also, qualifies, as, an, international, conflict, when, the, criteria, of, international, armed, conflict, have, been, met, the, full, protections, of, the, conventions, are, considered, to, apply, this, article, states, that, the, certain, minimum, rules, of, war, apply, to, armed, conflicts, not, of, an, international, character, the, international, committee, of, the, red, cross, has, explained, that, this, language, describes, non, international, armed, conflict, niac, where, at, least, one, party, is, not, a, state, for, example, it, would, apply, to, conflicts, between, state, forces, and, non, state, actors, nsas, or, between, two, nsas, or, to, other, conflicts, that, have, all, the, characteristics, of, war, whether, carried, out, within, the, confines, of, one, country, or, not, there, are, two, criteria, to, distinguish, non, international, armed, conflicts, from, lower, forms, of, violence, the, level, of, violence, has, to, be, of, certain, intensity, for, example, when, the, state, cannot, contain, the, situation, with, regular, police, forces, also, involved, non, state, groups, need, to, have, a, certain, level, of, organization, like, a, military, command, structure, the, other, geneva, conventions, are, not, applicable, in, this, situation, but, only, the, provisions, contained, within, article, 3, and, additionally, within, the, language, of, protocol, ii, the, rationale, for, the, limitation, is, to, avoid, conflict, with, the, rights, of, sovereign, states, that, were, not, part, of, the, treaties, when, the, provisions, of, this, article, apply, it, states, that, persons, taking, no, active, part, in, the, hostilities, including, members, of, armed, forces, who, have, laid, down, their, arms, and, those, placed, hors, de, combat, by, sickness, wounds, detention, or, any, other, cause, shall, in, all, circumstances, be, treated, humanely, without, any, adverse, distinction, founded, on, race, colour, religion, or, faith, sex, birth, or, wealth, or, any, other, similar, criteria, to, this, end, the, following, acts, are, and, shall, remain, prohibited, at, any, time, and, in, any, place, whatsoever, with, respect, to, the, above, mentioned, persons, during, the, negotiation, of, the, geneva, conventions, france, and, britain, were, initially, staunchly, opposed, to, common, article, 3, however, to, save, face, during, negotiations, and, make, strategic, concessions, france, and, britain, deliberately, introduced, ambiguous, language, in, the, text, of, common, article, 3, that, made, it, easy, for, states, to, avoid, the, obligations, of, the, rule, as, a, consequence, common, article, 3, only, concerns, with, humane, treatment, and, does, not, deal, with, methods, and, means, of, hostilities, such, as, bombings, committed, by, non, state, armed, groups, or, state, forces, against, civilian, targets, in, the, algerian, war, and, the, troubles, on, february, 7, 2002, president, bush, adopted, the, view, that, common, article, 3, did, not, protect, al, qaeda, prisoners, because, the, united, states, al, qaeda, conflict, was, not, of, an, international, character, the, supreme, court, of, the, united, states, invalidated, the, bush, administration, view, of, common, article, 3, in, hamdan, v, rumsfeld, by, ruling, that, common, article, three, of, the, geneva, conventions, applies, to, detainees, in, the, war, on, terror, and, that, the, guantanamo, military, commission, process, used, to, try, these, suspects, was, in, violation, of, u, s, and, international, law, in, response, to, hamdan, congress, passed, the, military, commissions, act, of, 2006, which, president, bush, signed, into, law, on, october, 17, 2006, like, the, military, commissions, act, of, 2006, its, successor, the, military, commissions, act, of, 2009, explicitly, forbids, the, invocation, of, the, geneva, conventions, as, a, basis, for, a, private, right, of, action, common, article, 3, continues, the, conventional, practice, reflected, in, both, the, lieber, and, the, hague, provisions, of, according, humanitarian, protections, only, to, belligerents, who, defer, to, the, laws, and, customs, of, war, not, to, insurrectionists, who, defy, these, norms, from, the, very, outset, of, hostilities, observance, of, the, rules, of, warfare, is, what, elevates, an, insurrectionist, to, the, legally, cognizable, status, of, belligerent, under, the, international, law, of, war, nothing, short, of, such, an, observance, suffices, to, effect, this, transformation, from, the, infra, legal, to, legal, whether, the, conflict, is, an, iac, or, a, niac, or, both, depends, on, the, nature, and, circumstances, of, the, situation, since, there, is, a, general, prohibition, against, the, use, of, force, between, states, as, is, reflected, within, article, 2, 4, of, the, united, nations, charter, with, respect, to, common, article, 2, it, is, generally, presumed, that, any, use, of, such, military, force, which, is, governed, by, international, humanitarian, law, ihl, is, attributable, to, deliberate, belligerent, intent, regarding, common, article, 3, the, icrc, in, its, 2016, commentary, stated, the, provision, includes, not, just, a, conflict, between, territorial, government, forces, and, nsas, or, nsas, themselves, but, also, a, foreign, military, intervention, against, a, nsa, only, if, the, territorial, state, consents, to, such, intervention, in, its, territory, should, the, intervening, country, do, so, without, the, consent, of, the, territorial, state, or, in, support, of, a, nsa, against, that, state, then, common, article, 2, applies, for, example, the, american, led, intervention, in, the, syrian, civil, war, became, both, an, iac, with, syria, and, a, niac, with, the, islamic, state, because, the, u, s, intervened, in, syrian, territory, without, the, former, s, consent, on, the, other, hand, russia, intervened, in, syrian, territory, against, the, free, syrian, army, upon, invitation, by, syria, making, russia, s, participation, subject, only, to, common, article, 3, and, therefore, protocol, ii, which, russia, ratified, on, september, 29, 1989, the, u, s, led, nato, invasion, of, afghanistan, from, october, 7, to, december, 17, 2001, was, initially, an, iac, because, it, waged, war, against, the, islamic, emirate, of, afghanistan, under, taliban, rule, once, the, new, karzai, administration, was, established, and, recognized, internationally, the, conflict, changed, from, an, iac, to, a, niac, with, nato, troops, under, international, security, assistance, force, isaf, and, resolute, support, mission, rsm, auspices, assisting, the, islamic, republic, of, afghanistan, with, its, consent, in, battling, taliban, insurgents, in, contrast, the, soviet, afghan, war, was, an, iac, because, the, soviet, union, invaded, the, democratic, republic, of, afghanistan, dra, to, remove, afghan, communist, leader, hafizullah, amin, from, power, then, installed, puppet, leader, babrak, karmal, who, invited, soviet, troops, to, intervene, against, the, afghan, mujahideen, fighters, while, non, state, armed, groups, are, automatically, presumed, to, engage, in, niacs, they, also, can, cross, into, the, threshold, of, an, iac, the, 2020, icrc, commentary, on, the, third, geneva, convention, requires, two, elements, for, this, classification, the, group, must, in, fact, fight, on, behalf, of, that, party, and, that, party, must, accept, both, the, fighting, role, of, the, group, and, the, fact, that, the, fighting, is, done, on, its, behalf, it, further, states, that, here, a, party, to, a, conflict, has, overall, control, over, the, militia, volunteer, corps, or, organized, resistance, movement, that, has, a, fighting, function, and, fights, on, the, state, s, behalf, a, relationship, of, belonging, for, the, purposes, of, article, 4a, 2, exists, for, example, the, viet, cong, was, under, effective, control, and, direction, by, north, vietnam, during, the, vietnam, war, therefore, common, article, 2, solely, applied, to, the, conflict, the, term, protecting, power, has, a, specific, meaning, under, these, conventions, a, protecting, power, is, a, state, that, is, not, taking, part, in, the, armed, conflict, but, that, has, agreed, to, look, after, the, interests, of, a, state, that, is, a, party, to, the, conflict, the, protecting, power, is, a, mediator, enabling, the, flow, of, communication, between, the, parties, to, the, conflict, the, protecting, power, also, monitors, the, implementation, of, these, conventions, such, as, by, visiting, the, zone, of, conflict, and, prisoners, of, war, the, protecting, power, must, act, as, an, advocate, for, prisoners, the, wounded, and, civilians, not, all, violations, of, the, treaty, are, treated, equally, the, most, serious, crimes, are, termed, grave, breaches, and, provide, a, legal, definition, of, a, war, crime, grave, breaches, of, the, third, and, fourth, geneva, conventions, include, the, following, acts, if, committed, against, a, person, specifically, protected, by, the, conventions, also, considered, grave, breaches, of, the, fourth, geneva, convention, are, the, following, nations, that, are, party, to, these, treaties, must, enact, and, enforce, legislation, penalizing, any, of, these, crimes, nations, are, also, obligated, to, search, for, persons, alleged, to, commit, these, crimes, or, persons, having, ordered, them, to, be, committed, and, to, bring, them, to, trial, regardless, of, their, nationality, and, regardless, of, the, place, where, the, crimes, took, place, the, principle, of, universal, jurisdiction, also, applies, to, the, enforcement, of, grave, breaches, when, the, united, nations, security, council, asserts, its, authority, and, jurisdiction, from, the, un, charter, to, apply, universal, jurisdiction, the, unsc, did, this, when, they, established, the, international, criminal, tribunal, for, rwanda, and, the, international, criminal, tribunal, for, the, former, yugoslavia, to, investigate, and, or, prosecute, alleged, violations, soldiers, as, prisoners, of, war, will, not, receive, a, trial, unless, the, allegation, of, a, war, crime, has, been, made, according, to, article, 43, of, the, 1949, conventions, soldiers, are, employed, for, the, purpose, of, serving, in, war, engaging, in, armed, conflict, is, legitimate, and, does, not, constitute, a, grave, breach, should, a, soldier, be, arrested, by, belligerent, forces, they, are, to, be, considered, lawful, combatants, and, afforded, the, protectorate, status, of, a, prisoner, of, war, pow, until, the, cessation, of, the, conflict, human, rights, law, applies, to, any, incarcerated, individual, including, the, right, to, a, fair, trial, charges, may, only, be, brought, against, an, enemy, pow, after, a, fair, trial, but, the, initial, crime, being, accused, must, be, an, explicit, violation, of, the, accords, more, severe, than, simply, fighting, against, the, captor, in, battle, no, trial, will, otherwise, be, afforded, to, a, captured, soldier, as, deemed, by, human, rights, law, this, element, of, the, convention, has, been, confused, during, past, incidents, of, detainment, of, us, soldiers, by, north, vietnam, where, the, regime, attempted, to, try, all, imprisoned, soldiers, in, court, for, committing, grave, breaches, on, the, incorrect, assumption, that, their, sole, existence, as, enemies, of, the, state, violated, international, law, although, warfare, has, changed, dramatically, since, the, geneva, conventions, of, 1949, they, are, still, considered, the, cornerstone, of, contemporary, international, humanitarian, law, they, protect, combatants, who, find, themselves, hors, de, combat, and, they, protect, civilians, caught, up, in, the, zone, of, war, these, treaties, came, into, play, for, all, recent, non, international, armed, conflicts, including, the, war, in, afghanistan, the, iraq, war, the, invasion, of, chechnya, 1994, 2017, and, the, russo, georgian, war, the, geneva, conventions, also, protect, those, affected, by, non, international, armed, conflicts, such, as, the, syrian, civil, war, the, lines, between, combatants, and, civilians, have, blurred, when, the, actors, are, not, exclusively, high, contracting, parties, hcp, since, the, fall, of, the, soviet, union, an, hcp, often, is, faced, with, a, non, state, actor, as, argued, by, general, wesley, clark, in, 2007, examples, of, such, conflict, include, the, sri, lankan, civil, war, the, sudanese, civil, war, and, the, colombian, armed, conflict, as, well, as, most, military, engagements, of, the, us, since, 2000, some, scholars, hold, that, common, article, 3, deals, with, these, situations, supplemented, by, protocol, ii, 1977, these, set, out, minimum, legal, standards, that, must, be, followed, for, internal, conflicts, international, tribunals, particularly, the, international, criminal, tribunal, for, the, former, yugoslavia, icty, have, clarified, international, law, in, this, area, in, the, 1999, prosecutor, v, dusko, tadic, judgement, the, icty, ruled, that, grave, breaches, apply, not, only, to, international, conflicts, but, also, to, internal, armed, conflict, further, those, provisions, are, considered, customary, international, law, controversy, has, arisen, over, the, us, designation, of, irregular, opponents, as, unlawful, enemy, combatants, see, also, unlawful, combatant, especially, in, the, scotus, judgments, over, the, guantanamo, bay, detention, camp, brig, facility, hamdi, v, rumsfeld, hamdan, v, rumsfeld, and, rasul, v, bush, and, later, boumediene, v, bush, president, george, w, bush, aided, by, attorneys, general, john, ashcroft, and, alberto, gonzales, and, general, keith, b, alexander, claimed, the, power, as, commander, in, chief, of, the, armed, forces, to, determine, that, any, person, including, an, american, citizen, who, is, suspected, of, being, a, member, agent, or, associate, of, al, qaeda, the, taliban, or, possibly, any, other, terrorist, organization, is, an, enemy, combatant, who, can, be, detained, in, u, s, military, custody, until, hostilities, end, pursuant, to, the, international, law, of, war, the, application, of, the, geneva, conventions, in, the, russo, ukrainian, war, 2014, present, has, been, troublesome, because, some, of, the, personnel, who, engaged, in, combat, against, the, ukrainians, were, not, identified, by, insignia, although, they, did, wear, military, style, fatigues, the, types, of, comportment, qualified, as, acts, of, perfidy, under, jus, in, bello, doctrine, are, listed, in, articles, 37, through, 39, of, the, geneva, convention, the, prohibition, of, fake, insignia, is, listed, at, article, 39, 2, but, the, law, is, silent, on, the, complete, absence, of, insignia, the, status, of, pows, captured, in, this, circumstance, remains, a, question, educational, institutions, and, organizations, including, harvard, university, the, international, committee, of, the, red, cross, and, the, rohr, jewish, learning, institute, use, the, geneva, convention, as, a, primary, text, investigating, torture, and, warfare, artificial, intelligence, and, autonomous, weapon, systems, such, as, military, robots, and, cyber, weapons, are, creating, challenges, in, the, creation, interpretation, and, application, of, the, laws, of, armed, conflict, the, complexity, of, these, new, challenges, as, well, as, the, speed, in, which, they, are, developed, complicates, the, application, of, the, conventions, which, have, not, been, updated, in, a, long, time, adding, to, this, challenge, is, the, very, slow, speed, of, the, procedure, of, developing, new, treaties, to, deal, with, new, forms, of, warfare, and, determining, agreed, upon, interpretations, to, existing, ones, meaning, that, by, the, time, a, decision, can, be, made, armed, conflict, may, have, already, evolved, in, a, way, that, makes, the, changes, obsolete
