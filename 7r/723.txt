prejudice, can, be, an, affective, feeling, towards, a, person, based, on, their, perceived, group, membership, the, word, is, often, used, to, refer, to, a, preconceived, usually, unfavourable, evaluation, or, classification, of, another, person, based, on, that, person, s, perceived, personal, characteristics, such, as, political, affiliation, sex, gender, gender, identity, beliefs, values, social, class, age, disability, religion, sexuality, race, ethnicity, language, nationality, culture, complexion, beauty, height, body, weight, occupation, wealth, education, criminality, sport, team, affiliation, music, tastes, or, other, perceived, characteristics, the, word, prejudice, can, also, refer, to, unfounded, or, pigeonholed, beliefs, and, it, may, apply, to, any, unreasonable, attitude, that, is, unusually, resistant, to, rational, influence, gordon, allport, defined, prejudice, as, a, feeling, favorable, or, unfavorable, toward, a, person, or, thing, prior, to, or, not, based, on, actual, experience, auestad, 2015, defines, prejudice, as, characterized, by, symbolic, transfer, transfer, of, a, value, laden, meaning, content, onto, a, socially, formed, category, and, then, on, to, individuals, who, are, taken, to, belong, to, that, category, resistance, to, change, and, overgeneralization, the, united, nations, institute, on, globalization, culture, and, mobility, has, highlighted, research, considering, prejudice, as, a, global, security, threat, due, to, its, use, in, scapegoating, some, populations, and, inciting, others, to, commit, violent, acts, towards, them, and, how, this, can, endanger, individuals, countries, and, the, international, community, the, word, prejudice, has, been, used, since, middle, english, around, the, year, 1300, it, comes, from, the, old, french, word, pr, judice, which, comes, from, latin, praei, dicium, which, comes, from, prae, before, and, i, dicium, judgment, the, first, psychological, research, conducted, on, prejudice, occurred, in, the, 1920s, this, research, attempted, to, prove, white, supremacy, one, article, from, 1925, which, reviewed, 73, studies, on, race, concluded, that, the, studies, seemed, to, indicate, the, mental, superiority, of, the, white, race, these, studies, along, with, other, research, led, many, psychologists, to, view, prejudice, as, a, natural, response, to, races, believed, to, be, inferior, in, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, this, perspective, began, to, change, due, to, the, increasing, concern, about, anti, semitism, due, to, the, ideology, of, the, nazis, at, the, time, theorists, viewed, prejudice, as, pathological, and, they, thus, looked, for, personality, syndromes, linked, with, racism, theodor, adorno, believed, that, prejudice, stemmed, from, an, authoritarian, personality, he, believed, that, people, with, authoritarian, personalities, were, the, most, likely, to, be, prejudiced, against, groups, of, lower, status, he, described, authoritarians, as, rigid, thinkers, who, obeyed, authority, saw, the, world, as, black, and, white, and, enforced, strict, adherence, to, social, rules, and, hierarchies, in, 1954, gordon, allport, in, his, classic, work, the, nature, of, prejudice, linked, prejudice, to, categorical, thinking, allport, claimed, that, prejudice, is, a, natural, and, normal, process, for, humans, according, to, him, the, human, mind, must, think, with, the, aid, of, categories, once, formed, categories, are, the, basis, for, normal, prejudgment, we, cannot, possibly, avoid, this, process, orderly, living, depends, upon, it, in, his, book, he, emphasizes, the, importance, of, the, contact, hypothesis, this, theory, posits, that, contact, between, different, ethnic, groups, can, reduce, prejudices, against, those, groups, allport, acknowledges, the, importance, of, the, circumstances, in, which, such, contact, occurs, he, has, attached, conditions, to, it, to, promote, positive, contact, and, reduce, prejudices, in, the, 1970s, research, began, to, show, that, prejudice, tends, to, be, based, on, favoritism, towards, one, s, own, groups, rather, than, negative, feelings, towards, another, group, according, to, marilyn, brewer, prejudice, may, develop, not, because, outgroups, are, hated, but, because, positive, emotions, such, as, admiration, sympathy, and, trust, are, reserved, for, the, ingroup, in, 1979, thomas, pettigrew, described, the, ultimate, attribution, error, and, its, role, in, prejudice, the, ultimate, attribution, error, occurs, when, ingroup, members, 1, attribute, negative, outgroup, behavior, to, dispositional, causes, more, than, they, would, for, identical, ingroup, behavior, and, 2, attribute, positive, outgroup, behavior, to, one, or, more, of, the, following, causes, a, a, fluke, or, exceptional, case, b, luck, or, special, advantage, c, high, motivation, and, effort, and, d, situational, factors, young, bruehl, 1996, argued, that, prejudice, cannot, be, treated, in, the, singular, one, should, rather, speak, of, different, prejudices, as, characteristic, of, different, character, types, her, theory, defines, prejudices, as, being, social, defences, distinguishing, between, an, obsessional, character, structure, primarily, linked, with, anti, semitism, hysterical, characters, primarily, associated, with, racism, and, narcissistic, characters, linked, with, sexism, the, out, group, homogeneity, effect, is, the, perception, that, members, of, an, out, group, are, more, similar, homogenous, than, members, of, the, in, group, social, psychologists, quattrone, and, jones, conducted, a, study, demonstrating, this, with, students, from, the, rival, schools, princeton, university, and, rutgers, university, students, at, each, school, were, shown, videos, of, other, students, from, each, school, choosing, a, type, of, music, to, listen, to, for, an, auditory, perception, study, then, the, participants, were, asked, to, guess, what, percentage, of, the, videotaped, students, classmates, would, choose, the, same, participants, predicted, a, much, greater, similarity, between, out, group, members, the, rival, school, than, between, members, of, their, in, group, the, justification, suppression, model, of, prejudice, was, created, by, christian, crandall, and, amy, eshleman, this, model, explains, that, people, face, a, conflict, between, the, desire, to, express, prejudice, and, the, desire, to, maintain, a, positive, self, concept, this, conflict, causes, people, to, search, for, justification, for, disliking, an, out, group, and, to, use, that, justification, to, avoid, negative, feelings, cognitive, dissonance, about, themselves, when, they, act, on, their, dislike, of, the, out, group, the, realistic, conflict, theory, states, that, competition, between, limited, resources, leads, to, increased, negative, prejudices, and, discrimination, this, can, be, seen, even, when, the, resource, is, insignificant, in, the, robber, s, cave, experiment, negative, prejudice, and, hostility, was, created, between, two, summer, camps, after, sports, competitions, for, small, prizes, the, hostility, was, lessened, after, the, two, competing, camps, were, forced, to, cooperate, on, tasks, to, achieve, a, common, goal, another, contemporary, theory, is, the, integrated, threat, theory, itt, which, was, developed, by, walter, g, stephan, it, draws, from, and, builds, upon, several, other, psychological, explanations, of, prejudice, and, ingroup, outgroup, behaviour, such, as, the, realistic, conflict, theory, and, symbolic, racism, it, also, uses, the, social, identity, theory, perspective, as, the, basis, for, its, validity, that, is, it, assumes, that, individuals, operate, in, a, group, based, context, where, group, memberships, form, a, part, of, individual, identity, itt, posits, that, outgroup, prejudice, and, discrimination, is, caused, when, individuals, perceive, an, outgroup, to, be, threatening, in, some, way, itt, defines, four, threats, realistic, threats, are, tangible, such, as, competition, for, a, natural, resource, or, a, threat, to, income, symbolic, threats, arise, from, a, perceived, difference, in, cultural, values, between, groups, or, a, perceived, imbalance, of, power, for, example, an, ingroup, perceiving, an, outgroup, s, religion, as, incompatible, with, theirs, intergroup, anxiety, is, a, feeling, of, uneasiness, experienced, in, the, presence, of, an, outgroup, or, outgroup, member, which, constitutes, a, threat, because, interactions, with, other, groups, cause, negative, feelings, e, g, a, threat, to, comfortable, interactions, negative, stereotypes, are, similarly, threats, in, that, individuals, anticipate, negative, behaviour, from, outgroup, members, in, line, with, the, perceived, stereotype, for, example, that, the, outgroup, is, violent, often, these, stereotypes, are, associated, with, emotions, such, as, fear, and, anger, itt, differs, from, other, threat, theories, by, including, intergroup, anxiety, and, negative, stereotypes, as, threat, types, additionally, social, dominance, theory, states, that, society, can, be, viewed, as, group, based, hierarchies, in, competition, for, scarce, resources, such, as, housing, or, employment, dominant, groups, create, prejudiced, legitimizing, myths, to, provide, moral, and, intellectual, justification, for, their, dominant, position, over, other, groups, and, validate, their, claim, over, the, limited, resources, legitimizing, myths, such, as, discriminatory, hiring, practices, or, biased, merit, norms, work, to, maintain, these, prejudiced, hierarchies, prejudice, can, be, a, central, contributing, factor, to, depression, this, can, occur, in, someone, who, is, a, prejudice, victim, being, the, target, of, someone, else, s, prejudice, or, when, people, have, prejudice, against, themselves, that, causes, their, own, depression, paul, bloom, argues, that, while, prejudice, can, be, irrational, and, have, terrible, consequences, it, is, natural, and, often, quite, rational, this, is, because, prejudices, are, based, on, the, human, tendency, to, categorise, objects, and, people, based, on, prior, experience, this, means, people, make, predictions, about, things, in, a, category, based, on, prior, experience, with, that, category, with, the, resulting, predictions, usually, being, accurate, though, not, always, bloom, argues, that, this, process, of, categorisation, and, prediction, is, necessary, for, survival, and, normal, interaction, quoting, william, hazlitt, who, stated, without, the, aid, of, prejudice, and, custom, i, should, not, be, able, to, find, my, way, my, across, the, room, nor, know, how, to, conduct, myself, in, any, circumstances, nor, what, to, feel, in, any, relation, of, life, in, recent, years, researchers, have, argued, that, the, study, of, prejudice, has, been, traditionally, too, narrow, it, is, argued, that, since, prejudice, is, defined, as, a, negative, affect, towards, members, of, a, group, there, are, many, groups, against, whom, prejudice, is, acceptable, such, as, rapists, men, who, abandon, their, families, pedophiles, neo, nazis, drink, drivers, queue, jumpers, murderers, etc, yet, such, prejudices, are, not, studied, it, has, been, suggested, that, researchers, have, focused, too, much, on, an, evaluative, approach, to, prejudice, rather, than, a, descriptive, approach, which, looks, at, the, actual, psychological, mechanisms, behind, prejudiced, attitudes, it, is, argued, that, this, limits, research, to, targets, of, prejudice, to, groups, deemed, to, be, receiving, unjust, treatment, while, groups, researchers, deem, treated, justly, or, deservedly, of, prejudice, are, overlooked, as, a, result, the, scope, of, prejudice, has, begun, to, expand, in, research, allowing, a, more, accurate, analysis, of, the, relationship, between, psychological, traits, and, prejudice, some, researchers, had, advocated, looking, into, understanding, prejudice, from, the, perspective, of, collective, values, than, just, as, biased, psychological, mechanism, and, different, conceptions, of, prejudice, including, what, lay, people, think, constitutes, prejudice, this, is, due, to, concerns, that, the, way, prejudice, has, been, operationalised, does, not, fit, its, psychological, definition, and, that, it, is, often, used, to, indicate, a, belief, is, faulty, or, unjustified, without, actually, proving, this, to, be, the, case, some, research, has, connected, dark, triad, personality, traits, machiavellianism, grandiose, narcissism, and, psychopathy, with, being, more, likely, to, hold, racist, sexist, xenophobic, homophobic, and, transphobic, views, one, can, be, prejudiced, against, or, have, a, preconceived, notion, about, someone, due, to, any, characteristic, they, find, to, be, unusual, or, undesirable, a, few, commonplace, examples, of, prejudice, are, those, based, on, someone, s, race, gender, nationality, social, status, sexual, orientation, or, religious, affiliation, and, controversies, may, arise, from, any, given, topic, transgender, and, non, binary, people, can, be, discriminated, against, because, they, identify, with, a, gender, that, does, not, align, with, their, assigned, sex, at, birth, refusal, to, call, them, by, their, preferred, pronouns, or, claims, that, they, are, not, the, gender, they, identify, as, could, be, considered, discrimination, especially, if, the, victim, of, this, discrimination, has, expressed, repetitively, what, their, preferred, identity, is, gender, identity, is, now, considered, a, protected, category, of, discrimination, therefore, severe, cases, of, this, discrimination, can, lead, to, criminal, penalty, or, prosecution, in, some, countries, and, workplaces, are, required, to, protect, against, discrimination, based, on, gender, identity, nationalism, is, a, sentiment, based, on, common, cultural, characteristics, that, binds, a, population, and, often, produces, a, policy, of, national, independence, or, separatism, it, suggests, a, shared, identity, amongst, a, nation, s, people, that, minimizes, differences, within, the, group, and, emphasizes, perceived, boundaries, between, the, group, and, non, members, this, leads, to, the, assumption, that, members, of, the, nation, have, more, in, common, than, they, actually, do, that, they, are, culturally, unified, even, if, injustices, within, the, nation, based, on, differences, like, status, and, race, exist, during, times, of, conflict, between, one, nation, and, another, nationalism, is, controversial, since, it, may, function, as, a, buffer, for, criticism, when, it, comes, to, the, nation, s, own, problems, since, it, makes, the, nation, s, own, hierarchies, and, internal, conflicts, appear, to, be, natural, it, may, also, serve, a, way, of, rallying, the, people, of, the, nation, in, support, of, a, particular, political, goal, nationalism, usually, involves, a, push, for, conformity, obedience, and, solidarity, amongst, the, nation, s, people, and, can, result, not, only, in, feelings, of, public, responsibility, but, also, in, a, narrow, sense, of, community, due, to, the, exclusion, of, those, who, are, considered, outsiders, since, the, identity, of, nationalists, is, linked, to, their, allegiance, to, the, state, the, presence, of, strangers, who, do, not, share, this, allegiance, may, result, in, hostility, classism, is, defined, by, dictionary, com, as, a, biased, or, discriminatory, attitude, on, distinctions, made, between, social, or, economic, classes, the, idea, of, separating, people, based, on, class, is, controversial, in, itself, some, argue, that, economic, inequality, is, an, unavoidable, aspect, of, society, so, there, will, always, be, a, ruling, class, some, also, argue, that, even, within, the, most, egalitarian, societies, in, history, some, form, of, ranking, based, on, social, status, takes, place, therefore, one, may, believe, the, existence, of, social, classes, is, a, natural, feature, of, society, others, argue, the, contrary, according, to, anthropological, evidence, for, the, majority, of, the, time, the, human, species, has, been, in, existence, humans, have, lived, in, a, manner, in, which, the, land, and, resources, were, not, privately, owned, also, when, social, ranking, did, occur, it, was, not, antagonistic, or, hostile, like, the, current, class, system, this, evidence, has, been, used, to, support, the, idea, that, the, existence, of, a, social, class, system, is, unnecessary, overall, society, has, neither, come, to, a, consensus, over, the, necessity, of, the, class, system, nor, been, able, to, deal, with, the, hostility, and, prejudice, that, occurs, because, of, the, class, system, individuals, with, non, heterosexual, sexual, attraction, such, as, homosexuals, and, bisexuals, may, experience, hatred, from, others, due, to, their, sexual, orientation, a, term, for, such, hatred, based, upon, one, s, sexual, orientation, is, homophobia, however, more, specific, words, for, discrimination, directed, towards, specific, sexualities, exist, under, other, names, such, as, biphobia, due, to, what, social, psychologists, call, the, vividness, effect, a, tendency, to, notice, only, certain, distinctive, characteristics, the, majority, population, tends, to, draw, conclusions, like, gays, flaunt, their, sexuality, such, images, may, be, easily, recalled, to, mind, due, to, their, vividness, making, it, harder, to, appraise, the, entire, situation, the, majority, population, may, not, only, think, that, homosexuals, flaunt, their, sexuality, or, are, too, gay, but, may, also, erroneously, believe, that, homosexuals, are, easy, to, identify, and, label, as, being, gay, or, lesbian, when, compared, to, others, who, are, not, homosexual, the, idea, of, heterosexual, privilege, has, been, known, to, flourish, in, society, research, and, questionnaires, are, formulated, to, fit, the, majority, i, e, heterosexuals, the, status, of, assimilating, or, conforming, to, heterosexual, standards, may, be, referred, to, as, heteronormativity, or, it, may, refer, to, ideology, that, the, primary, or, only, social, norm, is, being, heterosexual, in, the, us, legal, system, all, groups, are, not, always, considered, equal, under, the, law, the, gay, or, queer, panic, defense, is, a, term, for, defenses, or, arguments, used, to, defend, the, accused, in, court, cases, that, defense, lawyers, may, use, to, justify, their, client, s, hate, crime, against, someone, that, the, client, thought, was, lgbt, the, controversy, comes, when, defense, lawyers, use, the, victim, s, minority, status, as, an, excuse, or, justification, for, crimes, that, were, directed, against, them, this, may, be, seen, as, an, example, of, victim, blaming, one, method, of, this, defense, homosexual, panic, disorder, is, to, claim, that, the, victim, s, sexual, orientation, body, movement, patterns, such, as, their, walking, patterns, or, how, they, dance, or, appearance, that, is, associated, with, a, minority, sexual, orientation, provoked, a, violent, reaction, in, the, defendant, this, is, not, a, proven, disorder, is, no, longer, recognized, by, the, dsm, and, therefore, is, not, a, disorder, that, is, medically, recognized, but, it, is, a, term, to, explain, certain, acts, of, violence, research, shows, that, discrimination, on, the, basis, of, sexual, orientation, is, a, powerful, feature, of, many, labor, markets, for, example, studies, show, that, gay, men, earn, 10, 32, less, than, heterosexual, men, in, the, united, states, and, that, there, is, significant, discrimination, in, hiring, on, the, basis, of, sexual, orientation, in, many, labor, markets, racism, is, defined, as, the, belief, that, physical, characteristics, determine, cultural, traits, and, that, racial, characteristics, make, some, groups, superior, by, separating, people, into, hierarchies, based, upon, their, race, it, has, been, argued, that, unequal, treatment, among, the, different, groups, of, people, is, just, and, fair, due, to, their, genetic, differences, racism, can, occur, amongst, any, group, that, can, be, identified, based, upon, physical, features, or, even, characteristics, of, their, culture, though, people, may, be, lumped, together, and, called, a, specific, race, everyone, does, not, fit, neatly, into, such, categories, making, it, hard, to, define, and, describe, a, race, accurately, scientific, racism, began, to, flourish, in, the, eighteenth, century, and, was, greatly, influenced, by, charles, darwin, s, evolutionary, studies, as, well, as, ideas, taken, from, the, writings, of, philosophers, like, aristotle, for, example, aristotle, believed, in, the, concept, of, natural, slaves, this, concept, focuses, on, the, necessity, of, hierarchies, and, how, some, people, are, bound, to, be, on, the, bottom, of, the, pyramid, though, racism, has, been, a, prominent, topic, in, history, there, is, still, debate, over, whether, race, actually, exists, making, the, discussion, of, race, a, controversial, topic, even, though, the, concept, of, race, is, still, being, debated, the, effects, of, racism, are, apparent, racism, and, other, forms, of, prejudice, can, affect, a, person, s, behavior, thoughts, and, feelings, and, social, psychologists, strive, to, study, these, effects, while, various, religions, teach, their, members, to, be, tolerant, of, those, who, are, different, and, to, have, compassion, throughout, history, there, have, been, wars, pogroms, and, other, forms, of, violence, motivated, by, hatred, of, religious, groups, in, the, modern, world, researchers, in, western, educated, industrialized, rich, and, democratic, countries, have, done, various, studies, exploring, the, relationship, between, religion, and, prejudice, thus, far, they, have, received, mixed, results, a, study, done, with, us, college, students, found, that, those, who, reported, religion, to, be, very, influential, in, their, lives, seem, to, have, a, higher, rate, of, prejudice, than, those, who, reported, not, being, religious, other, studies, found, that, religion, has, a, positive, effect, on, people, as, far, as, prejudice, is, concerned, this, difference, in, results, may, be, attributed, to, the, differences, in, religious, practices, or, religious, interpretations, amongst, the, individuals, those, who, practice, institutionalized, religion, which, focuses, more, on, social, and, political, aspects, of, religious, events, are, more, likely, to, have, an, increase, in, prejudice, those, who, practice, interiorized, religion, in, which, believers, devote, themselves, to, their, beliefs, are, most, likely, to, have, a, decrease, in, prejudice, individuals, or, groups, may, be, treated, unfairly, based, solely, on, their, use, of, language, this, use, of, language, may, include, the, individual, s, native, language, or, other, characteristics, of, the, person, s, speech, such, as, an, accent, or, dialect, the, size, of, vocabulary, whether, the, person, uses, complex, and, varied, words, and, syntax, it, may, also, involve, a, person, s, ability, or, inability, to, use, one, language, instead, of, another, in, the, mid, 1980s, linguist, tove, skutnabb, kangas, captured, this, idea, of, discrimination, based, on, language, as, the, concept, of, linguicism, kangas, defined, linguicism, as, the, ideologies, and, structures, used, to, legitimate, effectuate, and, reproduce, unequal, division, of, power, and, resources, both, material, and, non, material, between, groups, which, are, defined, on, the, basis, of, language, broadly, speaking, attribution, of, low, social, status, to, those, who, do, not, conform, to, neurotypical, expectations, of, personality, and, behaviour, this, can, manifest, through, assumption, of, disability, status, to, those, who, are, high, functioning, enough, to, exist, outside, of, diagnostic, criteria, yet, do, not, desire, to, or, are, unable, to, conform, their, behaviour, to, conventional, patterns, this, is, a, controversial, and, somewhat, contemporary, concept, with, various, disciplinary, approaches, promoting, conflicting, messages, what, normality, constitutes, the, degree, of, acceptable, individual, difference, within, that, category, and, the, precise, criteria, for, what, constitutes, medical, disorder, this, has, been, most, prominent, in, the, case, of, high, functioning, autism, where, direct, cognitive, benefits, increasingly, appear, to, come, at, the, expense, of, social, intelligence, discrimination, may, also, extend, to, other, high, functioning, individuals, carrying, pathological, phenotypes, such, as, those, with, attention, deficit, hyperactivity, disorder, and, bipolar, spectrum, disorders, in, these, cases, there, are, indications, that, perceived, or, actual, socially, disadvantageous, cognitive, traits, are, directly, correlated, with, advantageous, cognitive, traits, in, other, domains, notably, creativity, and, divergent, thinking, and, yet, these, strengths, might, become, systematically, overlooked, the, case, for, neurological, discrimination, as, such, lies, in, the, expectation, that, one, s, professional, capacity, may, be, judged, by, the, quality, of, ones, social, interaction, which, can, in, such, cases, be, an, inaccurate, and, discriminatory, metric, for, employment, suitability, since, there, are, moves, by, some, experts, to, have, these, higher, functioning, extremes, reclassified, as, extensions, of, human, personality, any, legitimisation, of, discrimination, against, these, groups, would, fit, the, very, definition, of, prejudice, as, medical, validation, for, such, discrimination, becomes, redundant, recent, advancements, in, behavioural, genetics, and, neuroscience, have, made, this, a, very, relevant, issue, of, discussion, with, existing, frameworks, requiring, significant, overhaul, to, accommodate, the, strength, of, findings, over, the, last, decade, assumptions, may, be, made, about, the, intelligence, or, value, of, individuals, who, have, or, exhibit, behaviors, of, mental, disorders, or, conditions, individuals, who, have, a, difficult, time, assimilating, or, fitting, into, neurotypical, standards, and, society, may, be, label, low, functioning, people, with, neurological, disorders, or, conditions, observed, to, have, low, intelligence, lack, of, self, control, suicidal, behavior, or, any, number, of, factors, may, be, discriminated, on, this, basis, institutions, such, as, mental, asylums, nazi, concentration, camps, unethical, pediatric, research, care, facilities, and, eugenics, labs, have, been, used, to, carry, out, dangerous, experiments, or, to, torture, the, individuals, involved, most, discrimination, today, is, characterized, by, individuals, making, comments, towards, low, functioning, individuals, or, by, harming, them, physically, by, themselves, but, some, institutions, practice, unsafe, activities, on, these, individuals, humans, have, an, evolved, propensity, to, think, categorically, about, social, groups, manifested, in, cognitive, processes, with, broad, implications, for, public, and, political, endorsement, of, multicultural, policy, according, to, psychologists, richard, j, crisp, and, rose, meleady, they, postulated, a, cognitive, evolutionary, account, of, human, adaptation, to, social, diversity, that, explains, general, resistance, to, multiculturalism, and, offer, a, reorienting, call, for, scholars, and, policy, makers, who, seek, intervention, based, solutions, to, the, problem, of, prejudice, the, contact, hypothesis, predicts, that, prejudice, can, only, be, reduced, when, in, group, and, out, group, members, are, brought, together, in, particular, there, are, six, conditions, that, must, be, met, to, reduce, prejudice, as, were, cultivated, in, elliot, aronson, s, jigsaw, teaching, technique, first, the, in, and, out, groups, must, have, a, degree, of, mutual, interdependence, second, both, groups, need, to, share, a, common, goal, third, the, two,
