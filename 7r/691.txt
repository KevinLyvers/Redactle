totalitarianism, is, a, political, system, and, a, form, of, government, that, prohibits, opposition, political, parties, disregards, and, outlaws, the, political, claims, of, individual, and, group, opposition, to, the, state, and, controls, the, public, sphere, and, the, private, sphere, of, society, in, the, field, of, political, science, totalitarianism, is, the, extreme, form, of, authoritarianism, wherein, all, socio, political, power, is, held, by, a, dictator, who, also, controls, the, national, politics, and, the, peoples, of, the, nation, with, continual, propaganda, campaigns, that, are, broadcast, by, state, controlled, and, by, friendly, private, mass, communications, media, the, totalitarian, government, uses, ideology, to, control, most, aspects, of, human, life, such, as, the, political, economy, of, the, country, the, system, of, education, the, arts, the, sciences, and, the, private, life, morality, of, the, citizens, in, the, exercise, of, socio, political, power, the, difference, between, a, totalitarian, r, gime, of, government, and, an, authoritarian, r, gime, of, government, is, one, of, degree, whereas, totalitarianism, features, a, charismatic, dictator, and, a, fixed, worldview, authoritarianism, only, features, a, dictator, who, holds, power, for, the, sake, of, holding, power, and, is, supported, either, jointly, or, individually, by, a, military, junta, and, by, the, socio, economic, elites, who, are, the, ruling, class, of, the, country, modern, political, science, catalogues, three, r, gimes, of, government, i, the, democratic, ii, the, authoritarian, and, iii, the, totalitarian, varying, by, political, culture, the, functional, characteristics, of, the, totalitarian, r, gime, of, government, are, political, repression, of, all, opposition, individual, and, collective, a, cult, of, personality, about, the, leader, official, economic, interventionism, controlled, wages, and, prices, official, censorship, of, all, mass, communication, media, the, press, textbooks, cinema, television, radio, internet, official, mass, surveillance, policing, of, public, places, and, state, terrorism, in, the, essay, democide, in, totalitarian, states, mortacracies, and, megamurderers, 1994, the, american, political, scientist, rudolph, rummel, said, that, there, is, much, confusion, about, what, is, meant, by, totalitarian, in, the, literature, including, the, denial, that, such, systems, even, exist, i, define, a, totalitarian, state, as, one, with, a, system, of, government, that, is, unlimited, constitutionally, or, by, countervailing, powers, in, society, such, as, by, a, church, rural, gentry, labor, unions, or, regional, powers, is, not, held, responsible, to, the, public, by, periodic, secret, and, competitive, elections, and, employs, its, unlimited, power, to, control, all, aspects, of, society, including, the, family, religion, education, business, private, property, and, social, relationships, under, stalin, the, soviet, union, was, thus, totalitarian, as, was, mao, s, china, pol, pot, s, cambodia, hitler, s, germany, and, u, ne, win, s, burma, totalitarianism, is, then, a, political, ideology, for, which, a, totalitarian, government, is, the, agency, for, realizing, its, ends, thus, totalitarianism, characterizes, such, ideologies, as, state, socialism, as, in, burma, marxism, leninism, as, in, former, east, germany, and, nazism, even, revolutionary, muslim, iran, since, the, overthrow, of, the, shah, in, 1978, 79, has, been, totalitarian, here, totalitarianism, was, married, to, muslim, fundamentalism, in, short, totalitarianism, is, the, ideology, of, absolute, power, state, socialism, communism, nazism, fascism, and, muslim, fundamentalism, have, been, some, of, its, recent, raiments, totalitarian, governments, have, been, its, agency, the, state, with, its, international, legal, sovereignty, and, independence, has, been, its, base, as, will, be, pointed, out, mortacracy, is, the, result, in, exercising, the, power, of, government, upon, a, society, the, application, of, an, official, dominant, ideology, differentiates, the, worldview, of, the, totalitarian, r, gime, from, the, worldview, of, the, authoritarian, r, gime, which, is, only, concerned, with, political, power, and, as, long, as, is, not, contested, gives, society, a, certain, degree, of, liberty, having, no, ideology, to, propagate, the, politically, secular, authoritarian, government, does, not, attempt, to, change, the, world, and, human, nature, whereas, the, totalitarian, government, seeks, to, completely, control, the, thoughts, and, actions, of, its, citizens, by, way, of, an, official, totalist, ideology, a, party, reinforced, by, a, secret, police, and, monopolistic, control, of, industrial, mass, society, from, the, right, wing, perspective, the, social, phenomenon, of, political, totalitarianism, is, a, product, of, modernism, which, the, philosopher, karl, popper, said, originated, from, humanist, philosophy, from, the, republic, res, publica, proposed, by, plato, in, ancient, greece, from, hegel, s, conception, of, the, state, as, a, polity, of, peoples, and, from, the, political, economy, of, karl, marx, in, the, 19th, century, yet, historians, and, philosophers, of, those, periods, dispute, the, historiographic, accuracy, of, popper, s, 20th, century, interpretation, and, delineation, of, the, historical, origins, of, totalitarianism, because, the, ancient, greek, philosopher, plato, did, not, invent, the, modern, state, in, the, early, 20th, century, giovanni, gentile, proposed, italian, fascism, as, a, political, ideology, with, a, philosophy, that, is, totalitarian, and, the, fascist, state, a, synthesis, and, a, unity, inclusive, of, all, values, interprets, develops, and, potentiates, the, whole, life, of, a, people, in, 1920s, germany, during, the, weimar, republic, 1918, 1933, the, nazi, jurist, carl, schmitt, integrated, gentile, s, fascist, philosophy, of, united, national, purpose, to, the, supreme, leader, ideology, of, the, f, hrerprinzip, in, the, mid, 20th, century, the, german, academics, theodor, w, adorno, and, max, horkheimer, traced, the, origin, of, totalitarianism, to, the, age, of, reason, 17th, 18th, centuries, especially, to, the, anthropocentrist, proposition, that, man, has, become, the, master, of, the, world, a, master, unbound, by, any, links, to, nature, society, and, history, which, excludes, the, intervention, of, supernatural, beings, to, earthly, politics, of, government, in, the, essay, the, dark, forces, the, totalitarian, model, and, soviet, history, 1987, by, j, f, hough, and, in, the, book, the, totalitarian, legacy, of, the, bolshevik, revolution, 2019, by, alexander, riley, the, historians, said, that, the, russian, marxist, revolutionary, lenin, was, the, first, politician, to, establish, a, sovereign, state, of, the, totalitarian, model, as, the, duce, leading, the, italian, people, to, the, future, benito, mussolini, said, that, his, dictatorial, r, gime, of, government, made, fascist, italy, 1922, 1943, the, representative, totalitarian, state, everything, in, the, state, nothing, outside, the, state, nothing, against, the, state, likewise, in, the, concept, of, the, political, 1927, the, nazi, jurist, schmitt, used, the, term, der, totalstaat, the, total, state, to, identify, describe, and, establish, the, legitimacy, of, a, german, totalitarian, state, led, by, a, supreme, leader, american, historian, william, rubinstein, wrote, that, the, age, of, totalitarianism, included, nearly, all, the, infamous, examples, of, genocide, in, modern, history, headed, by, the, jewish, holocaust, but, also, comprising, the, mass, murders, and, purges, of, the, communist, world, other, mass, killings, carried, out, by, nazi, germany, and, its, allies, and, also, the, armenian, genocide, of, 1915, all, these, slaughters, it, is, argued, here, had, a, common, origin, the, collapse, of, the, elite, structure, and, normal, modes, of, government, of, much, of, central, eastern, and, southern, europe, as, a, result, of, world, war, i, without, which, surely, neither, communism, nor, fascism, would, have, existed, except, in, the, minds, of, unknown, agitators, and, crackpots, after, the, second, world, war, 1937, 1945, u, s, political, discourse, domestic, and, foreign, included, the, concepts, ideologic, and, political, and, the, terms, totalitarian, totalitarianism, and, totalitarian, model, in, the, post, war, u, s, of, the, 1950s, to, politically, discredit, the, anti, fascism, of, the, second, world, war, as, misguided, foreign, policy, mccarthyite, politicians, claimed, that, left, wing, totalitarianism, was, an, existential, threat, to, western, civilisation, and, so, facilitated, the, creation, of, the, american, national, security, state, to, execute, the, anti, communist, cold, war, 1945, 1989, that, was, fought, by, client, state, proxies, of, the, us, and, the, ussr, during, the, russo, american, cold, war, 1945, 1989, the, academic, field, of, kremlinology, analysing, politburo, policy, politics, produced, historical, and, policy, analyses, dominated, by, the, totalitarian, model, of, the, ussr, as, a, police, state, controlled, by, the, absolute, power, of, the, supreme, leader, stalin, who, heads, a, monolithic, centralised, hierarchy, of, government, the, study, of, the, internal, politics, of, the, politburo, crafting, policy, at, the, kremlin, produced, two, schools, of, historiographic, interpretation, of, cold, war, history, i, traditionalist, kremlinology, and, ii, revisionist, kremlinology, traditionalist, kremlinologists, worked, with, and, for, the, totalitarian, model, and, produced, interpretations, of, kremlin, politics, and, policies, that, supported, the, police, state, version, of, communist, russia, the, revisionist, kremlinologists, presented, alternative, interpretations, of, kremlin, politics, and, reported, the, effects, of, politburo, policies, upon, soviet, society, civil, and, military, despite, the, limitations, of, police, state, historiography, revisionist, kremlinologists, said, that, the, old, image, of, the, stalinist, ussr, of, the, 1950s, a, totalitarian, state, intent, upon, world, domination, was, oversimplified, and, inaccurate, because, the, death, of, stalin, changed, soviet, society, after, the, cold, war, and, the, dissolution, of, the, warsaw, pact, most, revisionist, kremlinologists, worked, the, national, archives, of, ex, communist, states, especially, the, state, archive, of, the, russian, federation, about, soviet, period, russia, in, the, 1950s, the, political, scientist, carl, joachim, friedrich, said, that, communist, states, such, as, soviet, russia, and, red, china, were, countries, systematically, controlled, with, the, five, features, of, the, totalitarian, model, of, government, by, a, supreme, leader, i, an, official, dominant, ideology, that, includes, a, cult, of, personality, about, the, leader, ii, control, of, all, civil, and, military, weapons, iii, control, of, the, public, and, the, private, mass, communications, media, iv, the, use, of, state, terrorism, to, police, the, populace, and, v, a, political, party, of, mass, membership, who, perpetually, re, elect, the, leader, in, the, 1960s, the, revisionist, kremlinologists, researched, the, organisations, and, studied, the, policies, of, the, relatively, autonomous, bureaucracies, that, influenced, the, crafting, of, high, level, policy, for, governing, soviet, society, in, the, ussr, revisionist, kremlinologists, such, as, j, arch, getty, and, lynne, viola, transcended, the, interpretational, limitations, of, the, totalitarian, model, by, recognising, and, reporting, that, the, soviet, government, the, communist, party, and, the, civil, society, of, the, ussr, had, greatly, changed, upon, the, death, of, stalin, the, revisionist, social, history, indicated, that, the, social, forces, of, soviet, society, had, compelled, the, government, of, the, ussr, to, adjust, public, policy, to, the, actual, political, economy, of, a, soviet, society, composed, of, pre, war, and, post, war, generations, of, people, with, different, perceptions, of, the, utility, of, communist, economics, for, all, the, russias, hence, russian, modern, history, had, outdated, the, totalitarian, model, that, was, the, post, stalinist, perception, of, the, police, state, ussr, of, the, 1950s, the, historiography, of, the, ussr, and, of, the, soviet, period, of, russian, history, is, in, two, schools, of, research, and, interpretation, i, the, traditionalist, school, of, historiography, and, ii, the, revisionist, school, of, historiography, traditionalist, school, historians, characterise, themselves, as, objective, reporters, of, the, claimed, totalitarianism, inherent, to, marxism, to, communism, and, to, the, political, nature, of, communist, states, such, as, the, ussr, moreover, traditionalist, historians, criticise, the, politically, liberal, bias, they, perceive, in, the, predominance, of, revisionist, historians, in, academic, publishing, and, claim, that, revisionist, school, historians, also, over, populate, the, faculties, of, colleges, universities, and, think, tanks, revisionist, school, historians, criticise, the, traditionalist, school, s, concentration, upon, the, police, state, aspects, of, cold, war, history, and, so, produce, anti, communist, history, biased, towards, a, right, wing, interpretation, of, the, documentary, facts, thus, the, revisionist, school, dismiss, traditionalist, historians, as, the, being, the, politically, reactionary, faculty, of, the, huac, school, of, scholarship, about, the, communist, party, usa, in, 1980, in, a, book, review, of, how, the, soviet, union, is, governed, 1979, by, j, f, hough, and, merle, fainsod, william, zimmerman, said, that, the, soviet, union, has, changed, substantially, our, knowledge, of, the, soviet, union, has, changed, as, well, we, all, know, that, the, traditional, paradigm, no, longer, satisfies, despite, several, efforts, primarily, in, the, early, 1960s, the, directed, society, totalitarianism, without, police, terrorism, the, system, of, conscription, to, articulate, an, acceptable, variant, we, have, come, to, realize, that, models, which, were, in, effect, offshoots, of, totalitarian, models, do, not, provide, good, approximations, of, post, stalinist, reality, in, a, book, review, of, totalitarian, space, and, the, destruction, of, aura, 2019, by, ahmed, saladdin, michael, scott, christofferson, said, that, hannah, arendt, s, interpretation, of, the, ussr, after, stalin, was, her, attempt, to, intellectually, distance, her, work, from, the, cold, war, misuse, of, the, concept, as, anti, communist, propaganda, in, the, essay, totalitarianism, defunct, theory, useful, word, 2010, the, historian, john, connelly, said, that, totalitarianism, is, a, useful, word, but, that, the, old, 1950s, theory, about, totalitarianism, is, defunct, among, scholars, because, the, word, is, as, functional, now, as, it, was, fifty, years, ago, it, means, the, kind, of, r, gime, that, existed, in, nazi, germany, the, soviet, union, the, soviet, satellites, communist, china, and, maybe, fascist, italy, where, the, word, originated, who, are, we, to, tell, v, clav, havel, or, adam, michnik, that, they, were, fooling, themselves, when, they, perceived, their, rulers, as, totalitarian, or, for, that, matter, any, of, the, millions, of, former, subjects, of, soviet, type, rule, who, use, the, local, equivalents, of, the, czech, totalita, to, describe, the, systems, they, lived, under, before, 1989, is, a, useful, word, and, everyone, knows, what, it, means, as, a, general, referent, problems, arise, when, people, confuse, the, useful, descriptive, term, with, the, old, theory, from, the, 1950s, in, revolution, and, dictatorship, the, violent, origins, of, durable, authoritarianism, 2022, the, political, scientists, steven, levitsky, and, lucan, way, said, that, nascent, revolutionary, r, gimes, usually, became, totalitarian, r, gimes, if, not, destroyed, with, a, military, invasion, such, a, revolutionary, r, gime, begins, as, a, social, revolution, independent, of, the, existing, social, structures, of, the, state, not, political, succession, election, to, office, or, a, military, coup, d, tat, and, produces, a, dictatorship, with, three, functional, characteristics, i, a, cohesive, ruling, class, comprising, the, military, and, the, political, lites, ii, a, strong, and, loyal, coercive, apparatus, of, police, and, military, forces, to, suppress, dissent, and, iii, the, destruction, of, rival, political, parties, organisations, and, independent, centres, of, socio, political, power, moreover, the, unitary, functioning, of, the, characteristics, of, totalitarianism, allow, a, totalitarian, government, to, perdure, against, economic, crises, internal, and, external, large, scale, failures, of, policy, mass, social, discontent, and, political, pressure, from, other, countries, some, totalitarian, one, party, states, were, established, through, coups, orchestrated, by, military, officers, loyal, to, a, vanguard, party, that, advanced, socialist, revolution, such, as, the, socialist, republic, of, the, union, of, burma, 1962, syrian, arab, republic, 1963, and, democratic, republic, of, afghanistan, 1978, in, 1923, in, the, early, reign, of, mussolini, s, government, 1922, 1943, the, anti, fascist, academic, giovanni, amendola, was, the, first, italian, public, intellectual, to, define, and, describe, totalitarianism, as, a, r, gime, of, government, wherein, the, supreme, leader, personally, exercises, total, power, political, military, economic, social, as, il, duce, of, the, state, that, italian, fascism, is, a, political, system, with, an, ideological, utopian, worldview, unlike, the, realistic, politics, of, the, personal, dictatorship, of, a, man, who, holds, power, for, the, sake, of, holding, power, later, the, theoretician, of, italian, fascism, giovanni, gentile, ascribed, politically, positive, meanings, to, the, ideological, terms, totalitarianism, and, totalitarian, in, defence, of, duce, mussolini, s, legal, illegal, and, legalistic, social, engineering, of, italy, as, ideologues, the, intellectual, gentile, and, the, politician, mussolini, used, the, term, totalitario, to, identify, and, describe, the, ideological, nature, of, the, societal, structures, government, social, economic, political, and, the, practical, goals, economic, geopolitical, social, of, the, new, fascist, italy, 1922, 1943, which, was, the, total, representation, of, the, nation, and, total, guidance, of, national, goals, in, proposing, the, totalitarian, society, of, italian, fascism, gentile, defined, and, described, a, civil, society, wherein, totalitarian, ideology, subservience, to, the, state, determined, the, public, sphere, and, the, private, sphere, of, the, lives, of, the, italian, people, that, to, achieve, the, fascist, utopia, in, the, imperial, future, italian, totalitarianism, must, politicise, human, existence, into, subservience, to, the, state, which, mussolini, summarised, with, the, epigram, everything, within, the, state, nothing, outside, the, state, nothing, against, the, state, hannah, arendt, in, her, book, the, origins, of, totalitarianism, contended, that, mussolini, s, dictatorship, was, not, a, totalitarian, regime, until, 1938, arguing, that, one, of, the, key, characteristics, of, a, totalitarian, movement, was, its, ability, to, garner, mass, mobilization, arendt, wrote, while, all, political, groups, depend, upon, proportionate, strength, totalitarian, movements, depend, on, the, sheer, force, of, numbers, to, such, an, extent, that, totalitarian, regimes, seem, impossible, even, under, otherwise, favorable, circumstances, in, countries, with, relatively, small, populations, ven, mussolini, who, was, so, fond, of, the, term, totalitarian, state, did, not, attempt, to, establish, a, full, fledged, totalitarian, regime, and, contented, himself, with, dictatorship, and, one, party, rule, for, example, victor, emmanuel, iii, still, reigned, as, a, figurehead, and, helped, play, a, role, in, the, dismissal, of, mussolini, in, 1943, also, the, catholic, church, was, allowed, to, independently, exercise, its, religious, authority, in, vatican, city, per, the, 1929, lateran, treaty, under, the, leadership, of, pope, pius, xi, 1922, 1939, and, pope, pius, xii, 1939, 1958, one, of, the, first, people, to, use, the, term, totalitarianism, in, the, english, language, was, austrian, writer, franz, borkenau, in, his, 1938, book, the, communist, international, in, which, he, commented, that, it, united, the, soviet, and, german, dictatorships, more, than, it, divided, them, the, label, totalitarian, was, twice, affixed, to, nazi, germany, during, winston, churchill, s, speech, of, 5, october, 1938, before, the, house, of, commons, in, opposition, to, the, munich, agreement, by, which, france, and, great, britain, consented, to, nazi, germany, s, annexation, of, the, sudetenland, churchill, was, then, a, backbencher, mp, representing, the, epping, constituency, in, a, radio, address, two, weeks, later, churchill, again, employed, the, term, this, time, applying, the, concept, to, a, communist, or, a, nazi, tyranny, jos, mar, a, gil, robles, y, qui, ones, the, leader, of, the, historic, spanish, reactionary, party, called, the, spanish, confederation, of, the, autonomous, right, ceda, declared, his, intention, to, give, spain, a, true, unity, a, new, spirit, a, totalitarian, polity, and, went, on, to, say, democracy, is, not, an, end, but, a, means, to, the, conquest, of, the, new, state, when, the, time, comes, either, parliament, submits, or, we, will, eliminate, it, general, francisco, franco, was, determined, not, to, have, competing, right, wing, parties, in, spain, and, ceda, was, dissolved, in, april, 1937, later, gil, robles, went, into, exile, politically, matured, by, having, fought, and, been, wounded, and, survived, the, spanish, civil, war, 1936, 1939, in, the, essay, why, i, write, 1946, the, socialist, george, orwell, said, the, spanish, war, and, other, events, in, 1936, 37, turned, the, scale, and, thereafter, i, knew, where, i, stood, every, line, of, serious, work, that, i, have, written, since, 1936, has, been, written, directly, or, indirectly, against, totalitarianism, and, for, democratic, socialism, as, i, understand, it, that, future, totalitarian, r, gimes, would, spy, upon, their, societies, and, use, the, mass, communications, media, to, perpetuate, their, dictatorships, that, if, you, want, a, vision, of, the, future, imagine, a, boot, stamping, on, a, human, face, forever, in, the, aftermath, of, the, second, world, war, 1937, 1945, in, the, lecture, series, 1945, and, book, 1946, titled, the, soviet, impact, on, the, western, world, the, british, historian, e, h, carr, said, that, the, trend, away, from, individualism, and, towards, totalitarianism, is, everywhere, unmistakable, in, the, decolonising, countries, of, eurasia, that, revolutionary, marxism, leninism, was, the, most, successful, type, of, totalitarianism, as, proved, by, the, ussr, s, rapid, industrialisation, 1929, 1941, and, the, great, patriotic, war, 1941, 1945, that, defeated, nazi, germany, that, despite, those, achievements, in, social, engineering, and, warfare, in, dealing, with, the, countries, of, the, communist, bloc, only, the, blind, and, incurable, ideologue, could, ignore, the, communist, r, gimes, trend, towards, police, state, totalitarianism, in, their, societies, in, the, origins, of, totalitarianism, 1951, the, political, scientist, hannah, arendt, said, that, in, their, times, in, the, early, 20th, century, corporate, nazism, and, soviet, communism, were, new, forms, of, totalitarian, government, not, updated, versions, of, the, old, tyrannies, of, a, military, or, a, corporate, dictatorship, that, the, human, emotional, comfort, of, political, certainty, is, the, source, of, the, mass, appeal, of, revolutionary, totalitarian, r, gimes, because, the, totalitarian, worldview, gives, psychologically, comforting, and, definitive, answers, about, the, complex, socio, political, mysteries, of, the, past, of, the, present, and, of, the, future, thus, did, nazism, propose, that, all, history, is, the, history, of, ethnic, conflict, of, the, survival, of, the, fittest, race, and, marxism, leninism, proposes, that, all, history, is, the, history, of, class, conflict, of, the, survival, of, the, fittest, social, class, that, upon, the, believers, acceptance, of, the, universal, applicability, of, totalitarian, ideology, the, nazi, revolutionary, and, the, communist, revolutionary, then, possess, the, simplistic, moral, certainty, with, which, to, justify, all, other, actions, by, the, state, either, by, an, appeal, to, historicism, law, of, history, or, by, an, appeal, to, nature, as, expedient, actions, necessary, to, establishing, an, authoritarian, state, apparatus, in, the, true, believer, thoughts, on, the, nature, of, mass, movements, 1951, eric, hoffer, said, that, political, mass, movements, such, as, italian, fascism, 1922, 1943, german, nazism, 1933, 1945, and, russian, stalinism, 1929, 1953, featured, the, common, political, praxis, of, negatively, comparing, their, totalitarian, society, as, culturally, superior, to, the, morally, decadent, societies, of, the, democratic, countries, of, western, europe, that, such, mass, psychology, indicates, that, participating, in, and, then, joining, a, political, mass, movement, offers, people, the, prospect, of, a, glorious, future, that, such, membership, in, a, community, of, political, belief, is, an, emotional, refuge, for, people, with, few, accomplishments, in, their, real, lives, in, both, the, public, sphere, and, in, the, private, sphere, in, the, event, the, true, believer, is, assimilated, into, a, collective, body, of, true, believers, who, are, mentally, protected, with, fact, proof, screens, from, reality, drawn, from, the, official, texts, of, the, totalitarian,

of, power, in, germany, in, 1933, frightened, christians, into, anti, communism, because, for, european, christians, catholic, and, protestant, alike, the, new, postwar, culture, war, crystallized, as, a, struggle, against, communism, throughout, the, european, interwar, period, 1918, 1939, right, wing, totalitarian, r, gimes, indoctrinated, christians, to, demonize, the, communist, r, gime, in, russia, as, the, apotheosis, of, secular, materialism, and, a, militarized, threat, to, worldwide, christian, social, and, moral, order, that, throughout, europe, the, christians, who, became, anti, communist, totalitarians, perceived, communism, and, communist, r, gimes, of, government, as, an, existential, threat, to, the, moral, order, of, their, respective, societies, and, collaborated, with, fascists, and, nazis, in, the, idealistic, hope, that, anti, communism, would, restore, the, societies, of, europe, to, their, root, christian, culture, in, the, u, s, geopolitics, of, the, late, 1950s, the, cold, war, concepts, and, the, terms, totalitarianism, totalitarian, and, totalitarian, model, presented, in, totalitarian, dictatorship, and, autocracy, 1956, by, carl, joachim, friedrich, and, zbigniew, brzezinski, became, common, usages, in, the, foreign, policy, discourse, of, the, u, s, subsequently, established, the, totalitarian, model, became, the, analytic, and, interpretational, paradigm, for, kremlinology, the, academic, study, of, the, monolithic, police, state, ussr, the, kremlinologists, analyses, of, the, internal, politics, policy, and, personality, of, the, politburo, crafting, policy, national, and, foreign, yielded, strategic, intelligence, for, dealing, with, the, ussr, moreover, the, u, s, also, used, the, totalitarian, model, when, dealing, with, fascist, totalitarian, r, gimes, such, as, that, of, a, banana, republic, country, as, anti, communist, political, scientists, friedrich, and, brzezinski, described, and, defined, totalitarianism, with, the, monolithic, totalitarian, model, of, six, interlocking, mutually, supporting, characteristics, as, traditionalist, historians, friedrich, and, brzezinski, said, that, the, totalitarian, r, gimes, of, government, in, the, ussr, 1917, fascist, italy, 1922, 1943, and, nazi, germany, 1933, 1945, originated, from, the, political, discontent, caused, by, the, socio, economic, aftermath, of, the, first, world, war, 1914, 1918, which, rendered, impotent, the, government, of, weimar, germany, 1918, 1933, to, resist, counter, and, quell, left, wing, and, right, wing, revolutions, of, totalitarian, temper, revisionist, historians, noted, the, historiographic, limitations, of, the, totalitarian, model, interpretation, of, soviet, and, russian, history, because, friedrich, and, brzezinski, did, not, take, account, of, the, actual, functioning, of, the, soviet, social, system, neither, as, a, political, entity, the, ussr, nor, as, a, social, entity, soviet, civil, society, which, could, be, understood, in, terms, of, socialist, class, struggle, among, the, professional, lites, political, academic, artistic, scientific, military, seeking, upward, mobility, into, the, nomenklatura, the, ruling, class, of, the, ussr, that, the, political, economics, of, the, politburo, allowed, measured, executive, power, to, regional, authorities, for, them, to, implement, policy, was, interpreted, by, revisionist, historians, as, evidence, that, a, totalitarian, r, gime, adapts, the, political, economy, to, include, new, economic, demands, from, civil, society, whereas, traditionalist, historians, interpreted, the, politico, economic, collapse, of, the, ussr, to, prove, that, the, totalitarian, r, gime, of, economics, failed, because, the, politburo, did, not, adapt, the, political, economy, to, include, actual, popular, participation, in, the, soviet, economy, the, historian, of, nazi, germany, karl, dietrich, bracher, said, that, the, totalitarian, typology, developed, by, friedrich, and, brzezinski, was, an, inflexible, model, for, not, including, the, revolutionary, dynamics, of, bellicose, people, committed, to, realising, the, violent, revolution, required, to, establish, totalitarianism, in, a, sovereign, state, that, the, essence, of, totalitarianism, is, total, control, to, remake, every, aspect, of, civil, society, using, a, universal, ideology, which, is, interpreted, by, an, authoritarian, leader, to, create, a, collective, national, identity, by, merging, civil, society, into, the, state, given, that, the, supreme, leaders, of, the, communist, the, fascist, and, the, nazi, total, states, did, possess, government, administrators, bracher, said, that, a, totalitarian, government, did, not, necessarily, require, an, actual, supreme, leader, and, could, function, by, way, of, collective, leadership, the, american, historian, walter, laqueur, agreed, that, bracher, s, totalitarian, typology, more, accurately, described, the, functional, reality, of, the, politburo, than, did, the, totalitarian, typology, proposed, by, friedrich, and, brzezinski, in, democracy, and, totalitarianism, 1968, the, political, scientist, raymond, aron, said, that, for, a, r, gime, of, government, to, be, considered, totalitarian, it, can, be, described, and, defined, with, the, totalitarian, model, of, five, interlocking, mutually, supporting, characteristics, laure, neumayer, posited, that, despite, the, disputes, over, its, heuristic, value, and, its, normative, assumptions, the, concept, of, totalitarianism, made, a, vigorous, return, to, the, political, and, academic, fields, at, the, end, of, the, cold, war, in, the, 1990s, fran, ois, furet, made, a, comparative, analysis, and, used, the, term, totalitarian, twins, to, link, nazism, and, stalinism, eric, hobsbawm, criticised, furet, for, his, temptation, to, stress, the, existence, of, a, common, ground, between, two, systems, with, different, ideological, roots, in, did, somebody, say, totalitarianism, five, interventions, in, the, mis, use, of, a, notion, i, ek, wrote, that, he, liberating, effect, of, general, augusto, pinochet, s, arrest, was, exceptional, as, the, fear, of, pinochet, dissipated, the, spell, was, broken, the, taboo, subjects, of, torture, and, disappearances, became, the, daily, grist, of, the, news, media, the, people, no, longer, just, whispered, but, openly, spoke, about, prosecuting, him, in, chile, itself, saladdin, ahmed, cited, hannah, arendt, as, stating, that, the, soviet, union, can, no, longer, be, called, totalitarian, in, the, strict, sense, of, the, term, after, stalin, s, death, writing, that, this, was, the, case, in, general, august, pinochet, s, chile, yet, it, would, be, absurd, to, exempt, it, from, the, class, of, totalitarian, regimes, for, that, reason, alone, saladdin, posited, that, while, chile, under, pinochet, had, no, official, ideology, there, was, one, man, who, ruled, chile, from, behind, the, scenes, none, other, than, milton, friedman, the, godfather, of, neoliberalism, and, the, most, influential, teacher, of, the, chicago, boys, was, pinochet, s, adviser, in, this, sense, saladdin, criticised, the, totalitarian, concept, because, it, was, only, being, applied, to, opposing, ideologies, and, it, was, not, being, applied, to, liberalism, in, the, early, 2010s, richard, shorten, vladimir, tism, neanu, and, aviezer, tucker, posited, that, totalitarian, ideologies, can, take, different, forms, in, different, political, systems, but, all, of, them, focus, on, utopianism, scientism, or, political, violence, they, posit, that, nazism, and, stalinism, both, emphasised, the, role, of, specialisation, in, modern, societies, and, they, also, saw, polymathy, as, a, thing, of, the, past, and, they, also, stated, that, their, claims, were, supported, by, statistics, and, science, which, led, them, to, impose, strict, ethical, regulations, on, culture, use, psychological, violence, and, persecute, entire, groups, their, arguments, have, been, criticised, by, other, scholars, due, to, their, partiality, and, anachronism, juan, francisco, fuentes, treats, totalitarianism, as, an, invented, tradition, and, he, believes, that, the, notion, of, modern, despotism, is, a, reverse, anachronism, for, fuentes, the, anachronistic, use, of, totalitarian, totalitarianism, involves, the, will, to, reshape, the, past, in, the, image, and, likeness, of, the, present, other, studies, try, to, link, modern, technological, changes, to, totalitarianism, according, to, shoshana, zuboff, the, economic, pressures, of, modern, surveillance, capitalism, are, driving, the, intensification, of, connection, and, monitoring, online, with, spaces, of, social, life, becoming, open, to, saturation, by, corporate, actors, directed, at, the, making, of, profit, and, or, the, regulation, of, action, toby, ord, believed, that, george, orwell, s, fears, of, totalitarianism, constituted, a, notable, early, precursor, to, modern, notions, of, anthropogenic, existential, risk, the, concept, that, a, future, catastrophe, could, permanently, destroy, the, potential, of, earth, originating, intelligent, life, due, in, part, to, technological, changes, creating, a, permanent, technological, dystopia, ord, said, that, orwell, s, writings, show, that, his, concern, was, genuine, rather, than, just, a, throwaway, part, of, the, fictional, plot, of, nineteen, eighty, four, in, 1949, orwell, wrote, that, ruling, class, which, could, guard, against, four, previously, enumerated, sources, of, risk, would, remain, in, power, permanently, that, same, year, bertrand, russell, wrote, that, modern, techniques, have, made, possible, a, new, intensity, of, governmental, control, and, this, possibility, has, been, exploited, very, fully, in, totalitarian, states, in, 2016, the, economist, described, china, s, developed, social, credit, system, under, chinese, communist, party, general, secretary, xi, jinping, s, administration, to, screen, and, rank, its, citizens, based, on, their, personal, behavior, as, totalitarian, opponents, of, china, s, ranking, system, say, that, it, is, intrusive, and, it, is, just, another, tool, which, a, one, party, state, can, use, to, control, the, population, supporters, say, that, it, will, transform, china, into, a, more, civilised, and, law, abiding, society, shoshana, zuboff, considers, it, instrumentarian, rather, than, totalitarian, north, korea, is, the, only, country, in, east, asia, to, survive, totalitarianism, after, the, death, of, kim, il, sung, in, 1994, and, handed, over, to, his, son, kim, jong, il, and, grandson, kim, jong, un, in, 2011, as, of, today, in, the, 21st, century, other, emerging, technologies, that, could, empower, future, totalitarian, regimes, include, brain, reading, contact, tracing, and, various, applications, of, artificial, intelligence, philosopher, nick, bostrom, said, that, there, is, a, possible, trade, off, namely, that, some, existential, risks, might, be, mitigated, by, the, establishment, of, a, powerful, and, permanent, world, government, and, in, turn, the, establishment, of, such, a, government, could, enhance, the, existential, risks, which, are, associated, with, the, rule, of, a, permanent, dictatorship, the, taliban, is, a, totalitarian, sunni, islamist, militant, group, and, political, movement, in, afghanistan, that, emerged, in, the, aftermath, of, the, soviet, afghan, war, and, the, end, of, the, cold, war, it, governed, most, of, afghanistan, from, 1996, to, 2001, and, returned, to, power, in, 2021, controlling, the, entirety, of, afghanistan, features, of, its, totalitarian, governance, include, the, imposition, of, pashtunwali, culture, of, the, majority, pashtun, ethnic, group, as, religious, law, the, exclusion, of, minorities, and, non, taliban, members, from, the, government, and, extensive, violations, of, women, s, rights, the, islamic, state, is, a, salafi, jihadist, militant, group, that, was, established, in, 2006, by, abu, omar, al, baghdadi, during, the, iraqi, insurgency, under, the, name, islamic, state, of, iraq, under, the, leadership, of, abu, bakr, al, baghdadi, the, organization, later, changed, its, name, to, the, islamic, state, of, iraq, and, levant, in, 2013, the, group, espouses, a, totalitarian, ideology, that, is, a, fundamentalist, hybrid, of, global, jihadism, wahhabism, and, qutbism, following, its, territorial, expansion, in, 2014, the, group, renamed, itself, as, the, islamic, state, and, declared, itself, as, a, caliphate, that, sought, domination, over, the, muslim, world, and, established, what, has, been, described, as, a, political, religious, totalitarian, regime, the, quasi, state, held, significant, territory, in, iraq, and, syria, during, the, course, of, the, third, iraq, war, and, the, syrian, civil, war, from, 2013, to, 2019, under, the, dictatorship, of, its, first, caliph, abu, bakr, al, baghdadi, who, imposed, a, strict, interpretation, of, sharia, law, francoist, spain, 1936, 1975, under, the, dictator, francisco, franco, has, been, characterized, as, a, totalitarian, state, until, at, least, the, 1950s, by, scholars, franco, was, portrayed, as, a, fervent, catholic, and, a, staunch, defender, of, catholicism, the, declared, state, religion, civil, marriages, that, had, taken, place, in, the, republic, were, declared, null, and, void, unless, they, had, been, validated, by, the, church, along, with, divorces, divorce, contraception, and, abortions, were, forbidden, according, to, historian, stanley, g, payne, franco, had, more, day, to, day, power, than, adolf, hitler, or, joseph, stalin, possessed, at, the, respective, heights, of, their, power, payne, noted, that, hitler, and, stalin, at, least, maintained, rubber, stamp, parliaments, while, franco, dispensed, with, even, that, formality, in, the, early, years, of, his, rule, according, to, payne, the, lack, of, even, a, rubber, stamp, parliament, made, franco, s, government, the, most, purely, arbitrary, in, the, world, however, from, 1959, to, 1974, the, spanish, miracle, took, place, under, the, leadership, of, technocrats, many, of, whom, were, members, of, opus, dei, and, a, new, generation, of, politicians, that, replaced, the, old, falangist, guard, reforms, were, implemented, in, the, 1950s, and, spain, abandoned, autarky, reassigning, economic, authority, from, the, isolationist, falangist, movement, this, led, to, massive, economic, growth, that, lasted, until, the, mid, 1970s, known, as, the, spanish, miracle, this, is, comparable, to, de, stalinization, in, the, soviet, union, in, the, 1950s, where, francoist, spain, changed, from, being, openly, totalitarian, to, an, authoritarian, dictatorship, with, a, certain, degree, of, economic, freedom, the, city, of, geneva, under, john, calvin, s, leadership, has, also, been, characterised, as, totalitarian, by, scholars, the, death, of, stalin, in, 1953, voided, the, simplistic, totalitarian, model, of, the, police, state, ussr, as, the, epitome, of, the, totalitarian, state, a, fact, common, to, the, revisionist, school, interpretations, of, the, reign, of, stalin, 1927, 1953, was, that, the, ussr, was, a, country, with, weak, social, institutions, and, that, state, terrorism, against, soviet, citizens, indicated, the, political, illegitimacy, of, stalin, s, government, that, the, citizens, of, the, ussr, were, not, devoid, of, personal, agency, or, of, material, resources, for, living, nor, were, soviet, citizens, psychologically, atomised, by, the, totalist, ideology, of, the, communist, party, of, the, soviet, union, because, the, soviet, political, system, was, chaotic, that, institutions, often, escaped, the, control, of, the, centre, and, that, stalin, s, leadership, consisted, to, a, considerable, extent, in, responding, on, an, ad, hoc, basis, to, political, crises, as, they, arose, that, the, legitimacy, of, stalin, s, r, gime, of, government, relied, upon, the, popular, support, of, the, soviet, citizenry, as, much, as, stalin, relied, upon, state, terrorism, for, their, support, that, by, politically, purging, soviet, society, of, anti, soviet, people, stalin, created, employment, and, upward, social, mobility, for, the, post, war, generation, of, working, class, citizens, for, whom, such, socio, economic, progress, was, unavailable, before, the, russian, revolution, 1917, 1924, that, the, people, who, benefited, from, stalin, s, social, engineering, became, stalinists, loyal, to, the, ussr, thus, the, revolution, had, fulfilled, her, promise, to, those, stalinist, citizens, and, they, supported, stalin, because, of, the, state, terrorism, in, the, case, of, east, germany, 0000, eli, rubin, posited, that, east, germany, was, not, a, totalitarian, state, but, rather, a, society, shaped, by, the, confluence, of, unique, economic, and, political, circumstances, interacting, with, the, concerns, of, ordinary, citizens, writing, in, 1987, walter, laqueur, posited, that, the, revisionists, in, the, field, of, soviet, history, were, guilty, of, confusing, popularity, with, morality, and, of, making, highly, embarrassing, and, not, very, convincing, arguments, against, the, concept, of, the, soviet, union, as, a, totalitarian, state, laqueur, stated, that, the, revisionists, arguments, with, regard, to, soviet, history, were, highly, similar, to, the, arguments, made, by, ernst, nolte, regarding, german, history, for, laqueur, concepts, such, as, modernisation, were, inadequate, tools, for, explaining, soviet, history, while, totalitarianism, was, not, laqueur, s, argument, has, been, criticised, by, modern, revisionist, school, historians, such, as, paul, buhle, who, said, that, laqueur, wrongly, equates, cold, war, revisionism, with, the, german, revisionism, the, latter, reflected, a, revanchist, military, minded, conservative, nationalism, moreover, michael, parenti, and, james, petras, have, suggested, that, the, totalitarianism, concept, has, been, politically, employed, and, used, for, anti, communist, purposes, parenti, has, also, analysed, how, left, anti, communists, attacked, the, soviet, union, during, the, cold, war, for, petras, the, cia, funded, the, congress, for, cultural, freedom, to, attack, stalinist, anti, totalitarianism, into, the, 21st, century, enzo, traverso, has, attacked, the, creators, of, the, concept, of, totalitarianism, as, having, invented, it, to, designate, the, enemies, of, the, west, according, to, some, scholars, calling, joseph, stalin, totalitarian, instead, of, authoritarian, has, been, asserted, to, be, a, high, sounding, but, specious, excuse, for, western, self, interest, just, as, surely, as, the, counterclaim, that, allegedly, debunking, the, totalitarian, concept, may, be, a, high, sounding, but, specious, excuse, for, russian, self, interest, for, domenico, losurdo, totalitarianism, is, a, polysemic, concept, with, origins, in, christian, theology, and, applying, it, to, the, political, sphere, requires, an, operation, of, abstract, schematism, which, makes, use, of, isolated, elements, of, historical, reality, to, place, fascist, regimes, and, the, soviet, union, in, the, dock, together, serving, the, anti, communism, of, cold, war, era, intellectuals, rather, than, reflecting, intellectual, research
