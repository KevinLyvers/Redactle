maya, script, also, known, as, maya, glyphs, is, historically, the, native, writing, system, of, the, maya, civilization, of, mesoamerica, and, is, the, only, mesoamerican, writing, system, that, has, been, substantially, deciphered, the, earliest, inscriptions, found, which, are, identifiably, maya, date, to, the, 3rd, century, bce, in, san, bartolo, guatemala, maya, writing, was, in, continuous, use, throughout, mesoamerica, until, the, spanish, conquest, of, the, maya, in, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, though, modern, mayan, languages, are, almost, entirely, written, using, the, latin, alphabet, rather, than, maya, script, there, have, been, recent, developments, encouraging, a, revival, of, the, maya, glyph, system, maya, writing, used, logograms, complemented, with, a, set, of, syllabic, glyphs, somewhat, similar, in, function, to, modern, japanese, writing, maya, writing, was, called, hieroglyphics, or, hieroglyphs, by, early, european, explorers, of, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, who, found, its, general, appearance, reminiscent, of, egyptian, hieroglyphs, although, the, two, systems, are, unrelated, evidence, suggests, that, codices, and, other, classic, texts, were, written, by, scribes, usually, members, of, the, maya, priesthood, in, classic, maya, a, literary, form, of, the, extinct, ch, olti, language, it, is, possible, that, the, maya, elite, spoke, this, language, as, a, lingua, franca, over, the, entire, maya, speaking, area, but, texts, were, also, written, in, other, mayan, languages, of, the, pet, n, and, yucat, n, especially, yucatec, there, is, also, some, evidence, that, the, script, may, have, been, occasionally, used, to, write, mayan, languages, of, the, guatemalan, highlands, however, if, other, languages, were, written, they, may, have, been, written, by, ch, olti, scribes, and, therefore, have, ch, olti, elements, mayan, writing, consisted, of, a, relatively, elaborate, and, complex, set, of, glyphs, which, were, laboriously, painted, on, ceramics, walls, and, bark, paper, codices, carved, in, wood, or, stone, and, molded, in, stucco, carved, and, molded, glyphs, were, painted, but, the, paint, has, rarely, survived, as, of, 2008, the, sound, of, about, 80, of, maya, writing, could, be, read, and, the, meaning, of, about, 60, could, be, understood, with, varying, degrees, of, certainty, enough, to, give, a, comprehensive, idea, of, its, structure, maya, texts, were, usually, written, in, blocks, arranged, in, columns, two, blocks, wide, with, each, block, corresponding, to, a, noun, or, verb, phrase, the, blocks, within, the, columns, were, read, left, to, right, top, to, bottom, and, would, be, repeated, until, there, were, no, more, columns, left, within, a, block, glyphs, were, arranged, top, to, bottom, and, left, to, right, similar, to, korean, hangul, syllabic, blocks, glyphs, were, sometimes, conflated, into, ligatures, where, an, element, of, one, glyph, would, replace, part, of, a, second, in, place, of, the, standard, block, configuration, maya, was, also, sometimes, written, in, a, single, row, or, column, or, in, an, l, or, t, shape, these, variations, most, often, appeared, when, they, would, better, fit, the, surface, being, inscribed, the, maya, script, was, a, logosyllabic, system, with, some, syllabogrammatic, elements, individual, glyphs, or, symbols, could, represent, either, a, morpheme, or, a, syllable, and, the, same, glyph, could, often, be, used, for, both, because, of, these, dual, readings, it, is, customary, to, write, logographic, readings, in, all, caps, and, phonetic, readings, in, italics, or, bold, for, example, a, calendaric, glyph, can, be, read, as, the, morpheme, manik, or, as, the, syllable, chi, glyphs, used, as, syllabograms, were, originally, logograms, for, single, syllable, words, usually, those, that, ended, in, a, vowel, or, in, a, weak, consonant, such, as, y, w, h, or, glottal, stop, for, example, the, logogram, for, fish, fin, found, in, two, forms, as, a, fish, fin, and, as, a, fish, with, prominent, fins, was, read, as, and, came, to, represent, the, syllable, ka, these, syllabic, glyphs, performed, two, primary, functions, as, phonetic, complements, to, disambiguate, logograms, which, had, more, than, one, reading, similar, to, ancient, egyptian, and, modern, japanese, furigana, and, to, write, grammatical, elements, such, as, verbal, inflections, which, did, not, have, dedicated, logograms, similar, to, japanese, okurigana, for, example, b, alam, jaguar, could, be, written, as, a, single, logogram, b, alam, a, logogram, with, syllable, additions, as, ba, b, alam, or, b, alam, ma, or, b, a, b, alam, ma, or, written, completely, phonetically, with, syllabograms, as, b, a, la, ma, in, addition, some, syllable, glyphs, were, homophones, such, as, the, six, different, glyphs, used, to, write, the, very, common, third, person, pronoun, u, phonetic, glyphs, stood, for, simple, consonant, vowel, cv, or, vowel, only, v, syllables, however, mayan, phonotactics, is, slightly, more, complicated, than, this, most, mayan, words, end, with, consonants, and, there, may, be, sequences, of, two, consonants, within, a, word, as, well, as, in, xolte, scepter, which, is, cvccvc, when, these, final, consonants, were, sonorants, l, m, n, or, gutturals, j, h, they, were, sometimes, ignored, underspelled, more, often, final, consonants, were, written, which, meant, that, an, extra, vowel, was, written, as, well, this, was, typically, an, echo, vowel, that, repeated, the, vowel, of, the, previous, syllable, for, example, the, word, fish, fin, would, be, underspelled, ka, or, written, in, full, as, ka, ha, however, there, are, many, cases, where, some, other, vowel, was, used, and, the, orthographic, rules, for, this, are, only, partially, understood, this, is, largely, due, to, the, difficulty, in, ascertaining, whether, this, vowel, may, be, due, to, an, underspelled, suffix, lacadena, wichmann, 2004, proposed, the, following, conventions, in, short, if, the, vowels, are, the, same, harmonic, a, simple, vowel, is, intended, if, the, vowels, are, not, the, same, disharmonic, either, two, syllables, are, intended, likely, underspelled, or, else, a, single, syllable, with, a, long, vowel, if, v, 1, and, v, 2, or, else, if, v, 1, and, v, 2, or, with, a, glottalized, vowel, if, v, 1, and, v, 2, or, else, if, v, 1, and, v, 2, the, long, vowel, reading, of, is, still, uncertain, and, there, is, a, possibility, that, represents, a, glottalized, vowel, if, it, is, not, simply, an, underspelling, for, so, it, may, be, that, the, disharmonies, form, natural, classes, for, long, non, front, vowels, otherwise, to, keep, it, disharmonic, for, glottalized, non, back, vowels, otherwise, a, more, complex, spelling, is, ha, o, bo, ko, ko, no, ma, for, they, are, the, guardians, a, minimal, set, is, despite, depending, on, consonants, which, were, frequently, not, written, the, mayan, voice, system, was, reliably, indicated, for, instance, the, paradigm, for, a, transitive, verb, with, a, cvc, root, is, as, follows, the, active, suffix, did, not, participate, in, the, harmonic, disharmonic, system, seen, in, roots, but, rather, was, always, wa, however, the, language, changed, over, 1500, years, and, there, were, dialectal, differences, as, well, which, are, reflected, in, the, script, as, seen, next, for, the, verb, s, he, sat, h, is, an, infix, in, the, root, chum, for, the, passive, voice, an, emblem, glyph, is, a, kind, of, royal, title, it, consists, of, a, place, name, followed, by, the, word, ajaw, a, classic, maya, term, for, lord, with, an, unclear, but, well, attested, etymology, sometimes, the, title, is, introduced, by, an, adjective, k, uhul, holy, divine, or, sacred, resulting, in, the, construction, holy, lord, however, an, emblem, glyph, is, not, a, glyph, at, all, it, can, be, spelled, with, any, number, of, syllabic, or, logographic, signs, and, several, alternative, spellings, are, attested, for, the, words, k, uhul, and, ajaw, which, form, the, stable, core, of, the, title, emblem, glyph, simply, reflects, the, time, when, mayanists, could, not, read, classic, maya, inscriptions, and, used, a, term, to, isolate, specific, recurring, structural, components, of, the, written, narratives, and, other, remaining, examples, of, maya, orthography, this, title, was, identified, in, 1958, by, heinrich, berlin, who, coined, the, term, emblem, glyph, berlin, noticed, that, the, emblem, glyphs, consisted, of, a, larger, main, sign, and, two, smaller, signs, now, read, as, k, uhul, ajaw, berlin, also, noticed, that, while, the, smaller, elements, remained, relatively, constant, the, main, sign, changed, from, site, to, site, berlin, proposed, that, the, main, signs, identified, individual, cities, their, ruling, dynasties, or, the, territories, they, controlled, subsequently, marcus, 1976, argued, that, the, emblem, glyphs, referred, to, archaeological, sites, or, more, so, the, prominence, and, standing, of, the, site, broken, down, in, a, 5, tiered, hierarchy, of, asymmetrical, distribution, marcus, research, assumed, that, the, emblem, glyphs, were, distributed, in, a, pattern, of, relative, site, importance, depending, on, broadness, of, distribution, roughly, broken, down, as, follows, primary, regional, centers, capitals, tikal, calakmul, and, other, superpowers, were, generally, first, in, the, region, to, acquire, a, unique, emblem, glyph, s, texts, referring, to, other, primary, regional, centers, occur, in, the, texts, of, these, capitals, and, dependencies, exist, which, use, the, primary, center, s, glyph, secondary, centers, altun, ha, lubaantun, xunantunich, and, other, mid, sized, cities, had, their, own, glyphs, but, are, only, rarely, mentioned, in, texts, found, in, the, primary, regional, center, while, repeatedly, mentioning, the, regional, center, in, their, own, texts, tertiary, centers, towns, had, no, glyphs, of, their, own, but, have, texts, mentioning, the, primary, regional, centers, and, perhaps, secondary, regional, centers, on, occasion, these, were, followed, by, the, villages, with, no, emblem, glyphs, and, no, texts, mentioning, the, larger, centers, and, hamlets, with, little, evidence, of, texts, at, all, this, model, was, largely, unchallenged, for, over, a, decade, until, mathews, and, justeson, as, well, as, houston, argued, once, again, that, the, emblem, glyphs, were, the, titles, of, maya, rulers, with, some, geographical, association, the, debate, on, the, nature, of, emblem, glyphs, received, a, new, spin, in, stuart, houston, 1994, the, authors, demonstrated, that, there, were, many, place, names, proper, some, real, some, mythological, mentioned, in, the, hieroglyphic, inscriptions, some, of, these, place, names, also, appeared, in, the, emblem, glyphs, some, were, attested, in, the, titles, of, origin, expressions, like, a, person, from, lubaantun, but, some, were, not, incorporated, in, personal, titles, at, all, moreover, the, authors, also, highlighted, the, cases, when, the, titles, of, origin, and, the, emblem, glyphs, did, not, overlap, building, upon, houston, s, earlier, research, houston, noticed, that, the, establishment, and, spread, of, the, tikal, originated, dynasty, in, the, petexbatun, region, was, accompanied, by, the, proliferation, of, rulers, using, the, tikal, emblem, glyph, placing, political, and, dynastic, ascendancy, above, the, current, seats, of, rulership, recent, investigations, also, emphasize, the, use, of, emblem, glyphs, as, an, emic, identifier, to, shape, socio, political, self, identity, the, mayas, used, a, positional, base, twenty, vigesimal, numerical, system, which, only, included, whole, numbers, for, simple, counting, operations, a, bar, and, dot, notation, was, used, the, dot, represents, 1, and, the, bar, represents, 5, a, shell, was, used, to, represent, zero, numbers, from, 6, to, 19, are, formed, combining, bars, and, dots, and, can, be, written, horizontally, or, vertically, numbers, over, 19, are, written, vertically, and, read, from, the, bottom, to, the, top, as, powers, of, 20, the, bottom, number, represents, numbers, from, 0, to, 20, so, the, symbol, shown, does, not, need, to, be, multiplied, the, second, line, from, the, bottom, represents, the, amount, of, 20s, there, are, so, that, number, is, multiplied, by, 20, the, third, line, from, the, bottom, represents, the, amount, of, 400s, so, it, is, multiplied, by, 400, the, fourth, by, 8000, the, fifth, by, 160, 000, etc, each, successive, line, is, an, additional, power, of, twenty, similar, to, how, in, arabic, numerals, additional, powers, of, 10, are, added, to, the, left, of, the, first, digit, this, positional, system, allows, the, calculation, of, large, figures, necessary, for, chronology, and, astronomy, it, was, until, recently, thought, that, the, maya, may, have, adopted, writing, from, the, olmec, or, epi, olmec, culture, who, used, the, isthmian, script, however, murals, excavated, in, 2005, have, pushed, back, the, origin, of, maya, writing, by, several, centuries, and, it, now, seems, possible, that, the, maya, were, the, ones, who, invented, writing, in, mesoamerica, scholarly, consensus, is, that, the, maya, developed, the, only, complete, writing, system, in, mesoamerica, before, the, arrival, of, spanish, conquistadors, the, aztecs, destroyed, many, mayan, works, and, sought, to, depict, themselves, as, the, true, rulers, through, a, fake, history, and, newly, written, texts, knowledge, of, the, maya, writing, system, continued, into, the, early, colonial, era, and, reportedly, a, few, of, the, early, spanish, priests, who, went, to, yucat, n, learned, it, however, as, part, of, his, campaign, to, eradicate, pagan, rites, bishop, diego, de, landa, ordered, the, collection, and, destruction, of, written, maya, works, and, a, sizable, number, of, maya, codices, were, destroyed, later, seeking, to, use, their, native, language, to, convert, the, maya, to, christianity, he, derived, what, he, believed, to, be, a, maya, alphabet, the, so, called, de, landa, alphabet, although, the, maya, did, not, actually, write, alphabetically, nevertheless, he, recorded, a, glossary, of, maya, sounds, and, related, symbols, which, was, long, dismissed, as, nonsense, for, instance, by, leading, mayanist, j, e, s, thompson, in, his, 1950, book, maya, hieroglyphic, writing, but, eventually, became, a, key, resource, in, deciphering, the, maya, script, the, difficulty, was, that, there, was, no, simple, correspondence, between, the, two, systems, and, the, names, of, the, letters, of, the, spanish, alphabet, meant, nothing, to, landa, s, maya, scribe, so, landa, ended, up, asking, things, like, write, ha, hache, a, and, glossed, a, part, of, the, result, as, h, which, in, reality, was, written, as, a, che, a, in, maya, glyphs, landa, was, also, involved, in, creating, an, orthography, or, a, system, of, writing, for, the, yucatec, maya, language, using, the, latin, alphabet, this, was, the, first, latin, orthography, for, any, of, the, mayan, languages, which, number, around, thirty, for, many, years, only, three, maya, codices, were, known, to, have, survived, the, conquistadors, this, was, expanded, with, the, 2015, authentication, of, the, grolier, codex, as, the, fourth, most, surviving, texts, are, found, on, pottery, recovered, from, maya, tombs, or, from, monuments, and, stelae, erected, in, sites, which, were, abandoned, or, buried, before, the, arrival, of, the, spanish, knowledge, of, the, writing, system, was, lost, probably, by, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, renewed, interest, in, it, was, sparked, by, published, accounts, of, ruined, maya, sites, in, the, 19th, century, deciphering, maya, writing, has, proven, a, long, and, laborious, process, 19th, century, and, early, 20th, century, investigators, managed, to, decode, the, maya, numbers, and, portions, of, the, texts, related, to, astronomy, and, the, maya, calendar, but, understanding, of, most, of, the, rest, long, eluded, scholars, in, the, 1930s, benjamin, whorf, wrote, a, number, of, published, and, unpublished, essays, proposing, to, identify, phonetic, elements, within, the, writing, system, although, some, specifics, of, his, decipherment, claims, were, later, shown, to, be, incorrect, the, central, argument, of, his, work, that, maya, hieroglyphs, were, phonetic, or, more, specifically, syllabic, was, later, supported, by, the, work, of, yuri, knorozov, 1922, 1999, who, played, a, major, role, in, deciphering, maya, writing, napoleon, cordy, also, made, some, notable, contributions, in, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, to, the, early, study, and, decipherment, of, maya, script, including, examples, of, phonetic, construction, in, maya, hieroglyphs, in, 1946, in, 1952, knorozov, published, the, paper, ancient, writing, of, central, america, arguing, that, the, so, called, de, landa, alphabet, contained, in, bishop, diego, de, landa, s, manuscript, relaci, n, de, las, cosas, de, yucat, n, was, made, of, syllabic, rather, than, alphabetic, symbols, he, further, improved, his, decipherment, technique, in, his, 1963, monograph, the, writing, of, the, maya, indians, and, published, translations, of, maya, manuscripts, in, his, 1975, work, maya, hieroglyphic, manuscripts, in, the, 1960s, progress, revealed, the, dynastic, records, of, maya, rulers, since, the, early, 1980s, scholars, have, demonstrated, that, most, of, the, previously, unknown, symbols, form, a, syllabary, and, progress, in, reading, the, maya, writing, has, advanced, rapidly, since, as, knorozov, s, early, essays, contained, several, older, readings, already, published, in, the, late, 19th, century, by, cyrus, thomas, and, the, soviet, editors, added, propagandistic, claims, to, the, effect, that, knorozov, was, using, a, peculiarly, marxist, leninist, approach, to, decipherment, many, western, mayanists, simply, dismissed, knorozov, s, work, however, in, the, 1960s, more, came, to, see, the, syllabic, approach, as, potentially, fruitful, and, possible, phonetic, readings, for, symbols, whose, general, meaning, was, understood, from, context, began, to, develop, prominent, older, epigrapher, j, eric, s, thompson, was, one, of, the, last, major, opponents, of, knorozov, and, the, syllabic, approach, thompson, s, disagreements, are, sometimes, said, to, have, held, back, advances, in, decipherment, for, example, coe, 1992, p, 164, says, the, major, reason, was, that, almost, the, entire, mayanist, field, was, in, willing, thrall, to, one, very, dominant, scholar, eric, thompson, g, ershova, a, student, of, knorozov, s, stated, that, reception, of, knorozov, s, work, was, delayed, only, by, authority, of, thompson, and, thus, has, nothing, to, do, with, marxism, but, he, knorozov, did, not, even, suspect, what, a, storm, of, hatred, his, success, had, caused, in, the, head, of, the, american, school, of, mayan, studies, eric, thompson, and, the, cold, war, was, absolutely, nothing, to, do, with, it, an, englishman, by, birth, eric, thompson, after, learning, about, the, results, of, the, work, of, a, young, soviet, scientist, immediately, realized, who, got, the, victory, in, 1959, examining, what, she, called, a, peculiar, pattern, of, dates, on, stone, monument, inscriptions, at, the, classic, maya, site, of, piedras, negras, russian, american, scholar, tatiana, proskouriakoff, determined, that, these, represented, events, in, the, lifespan, of, an, individual, rather, than, relating, to, religion, astronomy, or, prophecy, as, held, by, the, old, school, exemplified, by, thompson, this, proved, to, be, true, of, many, maya, inscriptions, and, revealed, the, maya, epigraphic, record, to, be, one, relating, actual, histories, of, ruling, individuals, dynastic, histories, similar, in, nature, to, those, recorded, in, other, human, cultures, throughout, the, world, suddenly, the, maya, entered, written, history, although, it, was, then, clear, what, was, on, many, maya, inscriptions, they, still, could, not, literally, be, read, however, further, progress, was, made, during, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, using, a, multitude, of, approaches, including, pattern, analysis, de, landa, s, alphabet, knorozov, s, breakthroughs, and, others, in, the, story, of, maya, decipherment, the, work, of, archaeologists, art, historians, epigraphers, linguists, and, anthropologists, cannot, be, separated, all, contributed, to, a, process, that, was, truly, and, essentially, multidisciplinary, key, figures, included, david, kelley, ian, graham, gilette, griffin, and, michael, coe, a, new, wave, of, breakthroughs, occurred, in, the, early, 1970s, in, particular, at, the, first, mesa, redonda, de, palenque, a, scholarly, conference, organized, by, merle, greene, robertson, at, the, maya, site, of, palenque, and, held, in, december, 1973, a, working, group, consisting, of, linda, schele, then, a, studio, artist, and, art, instructor, floyd, lounsbury, a, linguist, from, yale, and, peter, mathews, then, an, undergraduate, student, of, david, kelley, s, at, the, university, of, calgary, whom, kelley, sent, because, he, could, not, attend, in, one, afternoon, they, reconstructed, most, of, the, dynastic, list, of, palenque, building, on, the, earlier, work, of, heinrich, berlin, by, identifying, a, sign, as, an, important, royal, title, now, read, as, the, recurring, name, k, inich, the, group, was, able, to, identify, and, read, the, life, histories, from, birth, to, accession, to, the, throne, to, death, of, six, kings, of, palenque, palenque, was, the, focus, of, much, epigraphic, work, through, the, late, 1970s, but, linguistic, decipherment, of, texts, remained, very, limited, from, that, point, progress, proceeded, rapidly, scholars, such, as, j, kathryn, josserand, nick, hopkins, and, others, published, findings, that, helped, to, construct, a, mayan, vocabulary, the, old, school, continued, to, resist, the, results, of, the, new, scholarship, for, some, time, a, decisive, event, which, helped, to, turn, the, tide, in, favor, of, the, new, approach, occurred, in, 1986, at, an, exhibition, entitled, the, blood, of, kings, a, new, interpretation, of, maya, art, organized, by, intercultura, and, the, kimbell, art, museum, and, curated, by, schele, and, by, yale, art, historian, mary, miller, this, exhibition, and, its, attendant, catalogue, and, international, publicity, revealed, to, a, wide, audience, the, new, world, which, had, latterly, been, opened, up, by, progress, in, decipherment, of, maya, hieroglyphics, not, only, could, a, real, history, of, ancient, america, now, be, read, and, understood, but, the, light, it, shed, on, the, material, remains, of, the, maya, showed, them, to, be, real, recognisable, individuals, they, stood, revealed, as, a, people, with, a, history, like, that, of, all, other, human, societies, full, of, wars, dynastic, struggles, shifting, political, alliances, complex, religious, and, artistic, systems, expressions, of, personal, property, and, ownership, and, the, like, moreover, the, new, interpretation, as, the, exhibition, demonstrated, made, sense, out, of, many, works, of, art, whose, meaning, had, been, unclear, and, showed, how, the, material, culture, of, the, maya, represented, a, fully, integrated, cultural, system, and, world, view, gone, was, the, old, thompson, view, of, the, maya, as, peaceable, astronomers, without, conflict, or, other, attributes, characteristic, of, most, human, societies, however, three, years, later, in, 1989, supporters, who, continued, to, resist, the, modern, decipherment, interpretation, made, their, last, argument, against, it, this, occurred, at, a, conference, at, dumbarton, oaks, it, did, not, directly, attack, the, methodology, or, results, of, decipherment, but, instead, contended, that, the, ancient, maya, texts, had, indeed, been, read, but, were, epiphenomenal, this, argument, was, extended, from, a, populist, perspective, to, say, that, the, deciphered, texts, tell, only, about, the, concerns, and, beliefs, of, the, society, s, elite, and, not, about, the, ordinary, maya, in, opposition, to, this, idea, michael, coe, described, epiphenomenal, as, a, ten, penny, word, meaning, that, maya, writing, is, only, of, marginal, application, since, it, is, secondary, to, those, more, primary, institutions, economics, and, society, so, well, studied, by, the, dirt, archaeologists, linda, schele, noted, following, the, conference, that, this, is, like, saying, that, the, inscriptions, of, ancient, egypt, or, the, writings, of, greek, philosophers, or, historians, do, not, reveal, anything, important, about, their, cultures, most, written, documents, in, most, cultures, tell, us, about, the, elite, because, in, most,
