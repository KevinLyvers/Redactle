middle, english, abbreviated, to, me, is, a, form, of, the, english, language, that, was, spoken, after, the, norman, conquest, of, 1066, until, the, late, 15th, century, the, english, language, underwent, distinct, variations, and, developments, following, the, old, english, period, scholarly, opinion, varies, but, the, university, of, valencia, states, the, period, when, middle, english, was, spoken, as, being, from, 1150, to, 1500, this, stage, of, the, development, of, the, english, language, roughly, followed, the, high, to, the, late, middle, ages, middle, english, saw, significant, changes, to, its, vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation, and, orthography, writing, conventions, during, the, middle, english, period, varied, widely, examples, of, writing, from, this, period, that, have, survived, show, extensive, regional, variation, the, more, standardized, old, english, literary, variety, broke, down, and, writing, in, english, became, fragmented, and, localized, and, was, for, the, most, part, being, improvised, by, the, end, of, the, period, about, 1470, and, aided, by, the, invention, of, the, printing, press, by, johannes, gutenberg, in, 1439, a, standard, based, on, the, london, dialects, chancery, standard, had, become, established, this, largely, formed, the, basis, for, modern, english, spelling, although, pronunciation, has, changed, considerably, since, that, time, middle, english, was, succeeded, in, england, by, early, modern, english, which, lasted, until, about, 1650, scots, developed, concurrently, from, a, variant, of, the, northumbrian, dialect, prevalent, in, northern, england, and, spoken, in, southeast, scotland, during, the, middle, english, period, many, old, english, grammatical, features, either, became, simplified, or, disappeared, altogether, noun, adjective, and, verb, inflections, were, simplified, by, the, reduction, and, eventual, elimination, of, most, grammatical, case, distinctions, middle, english, also, saw, considerable, adoption, of, anglo, norman, vocabulary, especially, in, the, areas, of, politics, law, the, arts, and, religion, as, well, as, poetic, and, emotive, diction, conventional, english, vocabulary, remained, primarily, germanic, in, its, sources, with, old, norse, influences, becoming, more, apparent, significant, changes, in, pronunciation, took, place, particularly, involving, long, vowels, and, diphthongs, which, in, the, later, middle, english, period, began, to, undergo, the, great, vowel, shift, little, survives, of, early, middle, english, literature, due, in, part, to, norman, domination, and, the, prestige, that, came, with, writing, in, french, rather, than, english, during, the, 14th, century, a, new, style, of, literature, emerged, with, the, works, of, writers, including, john, wycliffe, and, geoffrey, chaucer, whose, canterbury, tales, remains, the, most, studied, and, read, work, of, the, period, the, transition, from, late, old, english, to, early, middle, english, had, taken, place, by, the, 1150s, to, 1180s, the, period, when, the, augustinian, canon, orrm, wrote, what, are, widely, regarded, as, the, oldest, surviving, texts, in, middle, english, now, called, the, ormulum, the, influence, of, old, norse, aided, the, development, of, english, from, a, synthetic, language, with, relatively, free, word, order, to, a, more, analytic, language, with, a, stricter, word, order, both, old, english, and, old, norse, as, well, as, the, descendants, of, the, latter, faroese, and, icelandic, were, synthetic, languages, with, complicated, inflections, the, eagerness, of, vikings, in, the, danelaw, to, communicate, with, their, anglo, saxon, neighbours, resulted, in, the, erosion, of, inflection, in, both, languages, old, norse, may, have, had, a, more, profound, impact, on, middle, and, modern, english, development, than, any, other, language, simeon, potter, says, no, less, far, reaching, was, the, influence, of, scandinavian, upon, the, inflexional, endings, of, english, in, hastening, that, wearing, away, and, leveling, of, grammatical, forms, which, gradually, spread, from, north, to, south, viking, influence, on, old, english, is, most, apparent, in, pronouns, modals, comparatives, pronominal, adverbs, like, hence, and, together, conjunctions, and, prepositions, show, the, most, marked, danish, influence, the, best, evidence, of, scandinavian, influence, appears, in, extensive, word, borrowings, yet, no, texts, exist, in, either, scandinavia, or, northern, england, from, this, period, to, give, certain, evidence, of, an, influence, on, syntax, however, at, least, one, scholarly, study, of, this, influence, shows, that, old, english, may, have, been, replaced, entirely, by, norse, by, virtue, of, the, change, from, the, old, english, syntax, to, norse, syntax, the, effect, of, old, norse, on, old, english, was, substantive, pervasive, and, of, a, democratic, character, like, close, cousins, old, norse, and, old, english, resembled, each, other, and, with, some, words, in, common, they, roughly, understood, each, other, in, time, the, inflections, melted, away, and, the, analytic, pattern, emerged, it, is, most, important, to, recognise, that, in, many, words, the, english, and, scandinavian, language, differed, chiefly, in, their, inflectional, elements, the, body, of, the, word, was, so, nearly, the, same, in, the, two, languages, that, only, the, endings, would, put, obstacles, in, the, way, of, mutual, understanding, in, the, mixed, population, that, existed, in, the, danelaw, these, endings, must, have, led, to, much, confusion, tending, gradually, to, become, obscured, and, finally, lost, this, blending, of, peoples, and, languages, resulted, in, simplifying, english, grammar, while, the, old, norse, influence, was, strongest, in, the, dialects, of, the, southern, part, of, north, which, formed, part, of, scandinavian, york, the, east, midlands, and, the, east, of, england, which, were, under, danish, control, words, in, the, spoken, language, emerged, in, the, 10th, and, 11th, centuries, near, the, transition, from, old, to, middle, english, influence, on, the, written, languages, only, appeared, from, the, beginning, of, the, 13th, century, this, delay, in, scandinavian, lexical, influence, in, english, has, been, attributed, to, the, lack, of, written, evidence, from, the, areas, of, danish, control, as, the, majority, of, written, sources, from, old, english, were, produced, in, wessex, in, the, west, saxon, dialect, the, heart, of, anglo, saxon, political, power, at, the, time, the, norman, conquest, of, england, in, 1066, saw, the, replacement, of, the, top, levels, of, the, english, speaking, political, and, ecclesiastical, hierarchies, by, norman, rulers, who, spoke, a, dialect, of, old, french, now, known, as, old, norman, which, developed, in, england, into, anglo, norman, the, use, of, norman, as, the, preferred, language, of, literature, and, polite, discourse, fundamentally, altered, the, role, of, old, english, in, education, and, administration, even, though, many, normans, of, this, period, were, illiterate, and, depended, on, the, clergy, for, written, communication, and, record, keeping, a, significant, number, of, words, of, norman, origin, began, to, appear, in, the, english, language, alongside, native, english, words, of, similar, meaning, giving, rise, to, such, modern, english, synonyms, as, pig, pork, chicken, poultry, calf, veal, cow, beef, sheep, mutton, wood, forest, house, mansion, worthy, valuable, bold, courageous, freedom, liberty, sight, vision, and, eat, dine, the, role, of, anglo, norman, as, the, language, of, government, and, law, can, be, seen, in, the, abundance, of, modern, english, words, for, the, mechanisms, of, government, that, are, derived, from, anglo, norman, such, as, court, judge, jury, appeal, and, parliament, there, are, also, many, norman, derived, terms, relating, to, the, chivalric, cultures, that, arose, in, the, 12th, century, an, era, of, feudalism, seigneurialism, and, crusading, words, were, often, taken, from, latin, usually, through, french, transmission, this, gave, rise, to, various, synonyms, including, kingly, inherited, from, old, english, royal, from, french, which, inherited, it, from, vulgar, latin, and, regal, from, french, which, borrowed, it, from, classical, latin, later, french, appropriations, were, derived, from, standard, rather, than, norman, french, examples, of, resultant, cognate, pairs, include, the, words, warden, from, norman, and, guardian, from, later, french, both, share, a, common, ancestor, loaned, from, germanic, the, end, of, anglo, saxon, rule, did, not, result, in, immediate, changes, to, the, language, the, general, population, would, have, spoken, the, same, dialects, as, they, had, before, the, conquest, once, the, writing, of, old, english, came, to, an, end, middle, english, had, no, standard, language, only, dialects, that, evolved, individually, from, old, english, early, middle, english, 1150, 1350, has, a, largely, anglo, saxon, vocabulary, with, many, norse, borrowings, in, the, northern, parts, of, the, country, but, a, greatly, simplified, inflectional, system, the, grammatical, relations, that, were, expressed, in, old, english, by, the, dative, and, instrumental, cases, were, replaced, in, early, middle, english, with, prepositional, constructions, the, old, english, genitive, es, survives, in, the, s, of, the, modern, english, possessive, but, most, of, the, other, case, endings, disappeared, in, the, early, middle, english, period, including, most, of, the, roughly, one, dozen, forms, of, the, definite, article, the, the, dual, personal, pronouns, denoting, exactly, two, also, disappeared, from, english, during, this, period, the, loss, of, case, endings, was, part, of, a, general, trend, from, inflections, to, fixed, word, order, that, also, occurred, in, other, germanic, languages, though, more, slowly, and, to, a, lesser, extent, and, therefore, it, cannot, be, attributed, simply, to, the, influence, of, french, speaking, sections, of, the, population, english, did, after, all, remain, the, vernacular, it, is, also, argued, that, norse, immigrants, to, england, had, a, great, impact, on, the, loss, of, inflectional, endings, in, middle, english, one, argument, is, that, although, norse, and, english, speakers, were, somewhat, comprehensible, to, each, other, due, to, similar, morphology, the, norse, speakers, inability, to, reproduce, the, ending, sounds, of, english, words, influenced, middle, english, s, loss, of, inflectional, endings, important, texts, for, the, reconstruction, of, the, evolution, of, middle, english, out, of, old, english, are, the, peterborough, chronicle, which, continued, to, be, compiled, up, to, 1154, the, ormulum, a, biblical, commentary, probably, composed, in, lincolnshire, in, the, second, half, of, the, 12th, century, incorporating, a, unique, phonetic, spelling, system, and, the, ancrene, wisse, and, the, katherine, group, religious, texts, written, for, anchoresses, apparently, in, the, west, midlands, in, the, early, 13th, century, the, language, found, in, the, last, two, works, is, sometimes, called, the, ab, language, more, literary, sources, of, the, 12th, and, 13th, centuries, include, layamon, s, brut, and, the, owl, and, the, nightingale, some, scholars, have, defined, early, middle, english, as, encompassing, english, texts, up, to, 1350, this, longer, time, frame, would, extend, the, corpus, to, include, many, middle, english, romances, especially, those, of, the, auchinleck, manuscript, c, 1330, gradually, the, wealthy, and, the, government, anglicised, again, although, norman, and, subsequently, french, remained, the, dominant, language, of, literature, and, law, until, the, 14th, century, even, after, the, loss, of, the, majority, of, the, continental, possessions, of, the, english, monarchy, in, the, aftermath, of, the, black, death, of, the, 14th, century, there, was, significant, migration, into, london, of, people, to, the, counties, of, the, southeast, of, england, and, from, the, east, and, central, midlands, of, england, and, a, new, prestige, london, dialect, began, to, develop, as, a, result, of, this, clash, of, the, different, dialects, that, was, based, chiefly, on, the, speech, of, the, east, midlands, but, also, influenced, by, that, of, other, regions, the, writing, of, this, period, however, continues, to, reflect, a, variety, of, regional, forms, of, english, the, ayenbite, of, inwyt, a, translation, of, a, french, confessional, prose, work, completed, in, 1340, is, written, in, a, kentish, dialect, the, best, known, writer, of, middle, english, geoffrey, chaucer, wrote, in, the, second, half, of, the, 14th, century, in, the, emerging, london, dialect, although, he, also, portrays, some, of, his, characters, as, speaking, in, northern, dialects, as, in, the, reeve, s, tale, in, the, english, speaking, areas, of, lowland, scotland, an, independent, standard, was, developing, based, on, the, northumbrian, dialect, this, would, develop, into, what, came, to, be, known, as, the, scots, language, a, large, number, of, terms, for, abstract, concepts, were, adopted, directly, from, scholastic, philosophical, latin, rather, than, via, french, examples, are, absolute, act, demonstration, and, probable, the, chancery, standard, of, written, english, emerged, c, 1430, in, official, documents, that, since, the, norman, conquest, had, normally, been, written, in, french, like, chaucer, s, work, this, new, standard, was, based, on, the, east, midlands, influenced, speech, of, london, clerks, using, this, standard, were, usually, familiar, with, french, and, latin, influencing, the, forms, they, chose, the, chancery, standard, which, was, adopted, slowly, was, used, in, england, by, bureaucrats, for, most, official, purposes, excluding, those, of, the, church, and, legalities, which, used, latin, and, law, french, respectively, the, chancery, standard, s, influence, on, later, forms, of, written, english, is, disputed, but, it, did, undoubtedly, provide, the, core, around, which, early, modern, english, formed, early, modern, english, emerged, with, the, help, of, william, caxton, s, printing, press, developed, during, the, 1470s, the, press, stabilized, english, through, a, push, towards, standardization, led, by, chancery, standard, enthusiast, and, writer, richard, pynson, early, modern, english, began, in, the, 1540s, after, the, printing, and, wide, distribution, of, the, english, bible, and, prayer, book, which, made, the, new, standard, of, english, publicly, recognizable, and, lasted, until, about, 1650, the, main, changes, between, the, old, english, sound, system, and, that, of, middle, english, include, the, combination, of, the, last, three, processes, listed, above, led, to, the, spelling, conventions, associated, with, silent, e, and, doubled, consonants, see, under, orthography, below, middle, english, retains, only, two, distinct, noun, ending, patterns, from, the, more, complex, system, of, inflection, in, old, english, nouns, of, the, weak, declension, are, primarily, inherited, from, old, english, n, stem, nouns, but, also, from, stem, w, stem, and, u, stem, nouns, which, did, not, inflect, in, the, same, way, as, n, stem, nouns, in, old, english, but, joined, the, weak, declension, in, middle, english, nouns, of, the, strong, declension, are, inherited, from, the, other, old, english, noun, stem, classes, some, nouns, of, the, strong, type, have, an, e, in, the, nominative, accusative, singular, like, the, weak, declension, but, otherwise, strong, endings, often, these, are, the, same, nouns, that, had, an, e, in, the, nominative, accusative, singular, of, old, english, they, in, turn, were, inherited, from, proto, germanic, ja, stem, and, i, stem, nouns, the, distinct, dative, case, was, lost, in, early, middle, english, the, genitive, survived, however, but, by, the, end, of, the, middle, english, period, only, the, strong, s, ending, variously, spelt, was, in, use, some, formerly, feminine, nouns, as, well, as, some, weak, nouns, continued, to, make, their, genitive, forms, with, e, or, no, ending, e, g, fole, hoves, horses, hooves, and, nouns, of, relationship, ending, in, er, frequently, have, no, genitive, ending, e, g, fader, bone, father, s, bane, the, strong, e, s, plural, form, has, survived, into, modern, english, the, weak, e, n, form, is, now, rare, and, used, only, in, oxen, and, as, part, of, a, double, plural, in, children, and, brethren, some, dialects, still, have, forms, such, as, eyen, for, eyes, shoon, for, shoes, hosen, for, hose, s, kine, for, cows, and, been, for, bees, grammatical, gender, survived, to, a, limited, extent, in, early, middle, english, before, being, replaced, by, natural, gender, in, the, course, of, the, middle, english, period, grammatical, gender, was, indicated, by, agreement, of, articles, and, pronouns, e, g, o, ule, the, feminine, owl, or, using, the, pronoun, he, to, refer, to, masculine, nouns, such, as, helm, helmet, or, phrases, such, as, scaft, st, rcne, strong, shaft, with, the, masculine, accusative, adjective, ending, ne, single, syllable, adjectives, added, e, when, modifying, a, noun, in, the, plural, and, when, used, after, the, definite, article, e, after, a, demonstrative, is, at, after, a, possessive, pronoun, e, g, hir, our, or, with, a, name, or, in, a, form, of, address, this, derives, from, the, old, english, weak, declension, of, adjectives, this, inflexion, continued, to, be, used, in, writing, even, after, final, e, had, ceased, to, be, pronounced, in, earlier, texts, multisyllable, adjectives, also, receive, a, final, e, in, these, situations, but, this, occurs, less, regularly, in, later, middle, english, texts, otherwise, adjectives, have, no, ending, and, adjectives, already, ending, in, e, etymologically, receive, no, ending, as, well, earlier, texts, sometimes, inflect, adjectives, for, case, as, well, layamon, s, brut, inflects, adjectives, for, the, masculine, accusative, genitive, and, dative, the, feminine, dative, and, the, plural, genitive, the, owl, and, the, nightingale, adds, a, final, e, to, all, adjectives, not, in, the, nominative, here, only, inflecting, adjectives, in, the, weak, declension, as, described, above, comparatives, and, superlatives, were, usually, formed, by, adding, er, and, est, adjectives, with, long, vowels, sometimes, shortened, these, vowels, in, the, comparative, and, superlative, e, g, greet, great, gretter, greater, adjectives, ending, in, ly, or, lich, formed, comparatives, either, with, lier, liest, or, loker, lokest, a, few, adjectives, also, displayed, germanic, umlaut, in, their, comparatives, and, superlatives, such, as, long, lenger, other, irregular, forms, were, mostly, the, same, as, in, modern, english, middle, english, personal, pronouns, were, mostly, developed, from, those, of, old, english, with, the, exception, of, the, third, person, plural, a, borrowing, from, old, norse, the, original, old, english, form, clashed, with, the, third, person, singular, and, was, eventually, dropped, also, the, nominative, form, of, the, feminine, third, person, singular, was, replaced, by, a, form, of, the, demonstrative, that, developed, into, sche, modern, she, but, the, alternative, heyr, remained, in, some, areas, for, a, long, time, as, with, nouns, there, was, some, inflectional, simplification, the, distinct, old, english, dual, forms, were, lost, but, pronouns, unlike, nouns, retained, distinct, nominative, and, accusative, forms, third, person, pronouns, also, retained, a, distinction, between, accusative, and, dative, forms, but, that, was, gradually, lost, the, masculine, hine, was, replaced, by, him, south, of, the, river, thames, by, the, early, 14th, century, and, the, neuter, dative, him, was, ousted, by, it, in, most, dialects, by, the, 15th, the, following, table, shows, some, of, the, various, middle, english, pronouns, many, other, variations, are, noted, in, middle, english, sources, because, of, differences, in, spellings, and, pronunciations, at, different, times, and, in, different, dialects, as, a, general, rule, the, indicative, first, person, singular, of, verbs, in, the, present, tense, ended, in, e, e, g, ich, here, i, hear, the, second, person, singular, in, e, st, e, g, ou, spekest, thou, speakest, and, the, third, person, singular, in, e, e, g, he, come, he, cometh, he, comes, the, letter, thorn, is, pronounced, like, the, unvoiced, th, in, think, but, under, certain, circumstances, it, may, be, like, the, voiced, th, in, that, the, following, table, illustrates, a, typical, conjugation, pattern, plural, forms, vary, strongly, by, dialect, with, southern, dialects, preserving, the, old, english, e, midland, dialects, showing, en, from, about, 1200, and, northern, forms, using, es, in, the, third, person, singular, as, well, as, the, plural, the, past, tense, of, weak, verbs, was, formed, by, adding, an, ed, e, d, e, or, t, e, ending, the, past, tense, forms, without, their, personal, endings, also, served, as, past, participles, with, past, participle, prefixes, derived, from, old, english, i, y, and, sometimes, bi, strong, verbs, by, contrast, formed, their, past, tense, by, changing, their, stem, vowel, e, g, binden, became, bound, a, process, called, apophony, as, in, modern, english, with, the, discontinuation, of, the, late, west, saxon, standard, used, for, the, writing, of, old, english, in, the, period, prior, to, the, norman, conquest, middle, english, came, to, be, written, in, a, wide, variety, of, scribal, forms, reflecting, different, regional, dialects, and, orthographic, conventions, later, in, the, middle, english, period, however, and, particularly, with, the, development, of, the, chancery, standard, in, the, 15th, century, orthography, became, relatively, standardised, in, a, form, based, on, the, east, midlands, influenced, speech, of, london, spelling, at, the, time, was, mostly, quite, regular, there, was, a, fairly, consistent, correspondence, between, letters, and, sounds, the, irregularity, of, present, day, english, orthography, is, largely, due, to, pronunciation, changes, that, have, taken, place, over, the, early, modern, english, and, modern, english, eras, middle, english, generally, did, not, have, silent, letters, for, example, knight, was, pronounced, with, both, the, k, and, the, gh, pronounced, the, latter, sounding, as, the, ch, in, german, knecht, the, major, exception, was, the, silent, e, originally, pronounced, but, lost, in, normal, speech, by, chaucer, s, time, this, letter, however, came, to, indicate, a, lengthened, and, later, also, modified, pronunciation, of, a, preceding, vowel, for, example, in, name, originally, pronounced, as, two, syllables, the, a, in, the, first, syllable, originally, an, open, syllable, lengthened, the, final, weak, vowel, was, later, dropped, and, the, remaining, long, vowel, was, modified, in, the, great, vowel, shift, for, these, sound, changes, see, phonology, above, the, final, e, now, silent, thus, became, the, indicator, of, the, longer, and, changed, pronunciation, of, a, in, fact, vowels, could, have, this, lengthened, and, modified, pronunciation, in, various, positions, particularly, before, a, single, consonant, letter, and, another, vowel, or, before, certain, pairs, of, consonants, a, related, convention, involved, the, doubling, of, consonant, letters, to, show, that, the, preceding, vowel, was, not, to, be, lengthened, in, some, cases, the, double, consonant, represented, a, sound, that, was, or, had, previously, been, geminated, i, e, had, genuinely, been, doubled, and, would, thus, have, regularly, blocked, the, lengthening, of, the, preceding, vowel, in, other, cases, by, analogy, the, consonant, was, written, double, merely, to, indicate, the, lack, of, lengthening, the, basic, old, english, latin, alphabet, consisted, of, 20, standard, letters, plus, four, additional, letters, ash, eth, thorn, and, wynn, there, was, not, yet, a, distinct, j, v, or, w, and, old, english, scribes, did, not, generally, use, k, q, or, z, ash, was, no, longer, required, in, middle, english, as, the, old, english, vowel, that, it, represented, had, merged, into, a, the, symbol, nonetheless, came, to, be, used, as, a, ligature, for, the, digraph, ae, in, many, words, of, greek, or, latin, origin, as, did, for, oe, eth, and, thorn, both, represented, or, its, allophone, in, old, english, eth, fell, out, of, use, during, the, 13th, century, and, was, replaced, by, thorn, thorn, mostly, fell, out, of, use, during, the, 14th, century, and, was, replaced, by, th, anachronistic, usage, of, the, scribal, abbreviation, e, the, has, led, to, the, modern, mispronunciation, of, thorn, as, y, in, this, context, see, ye, olde, wynn, which, represented, the, phoneme, w, was, replaced, by, w, during, the, 13th, century, due, to, its, similarity, to, the, letter, p, it, is, mostly, represented, by, w, in, modern, editions, of, old, and, middle, english, texts, even, when, the, manuscript, has, wynn, under, norman, influence, the, continental, carolingian, minuscule, replaced, the, insular, script, that, had, been, used, for, old, english, however, because, of, the, significant, difference, in, appearance, between, the, old, insular, g, and, the, carolingian, g, modern, g, the, former, continued, in, use, as, a, separate, letter, known, as, yogh, written, this, was, adopted, for, use, to, represent, a, variety, of, sounds, while, the, carolingian, g, was, normally, used, for, instances, of, yogh, were, eventually, replaced, by, j, or, y, and, by, gh, in, words, like, night, and, laugh,
