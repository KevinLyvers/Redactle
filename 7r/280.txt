the, league, of, nations, ln, or, lon, french, soci, t, des, nations, sdn, was, the, first, worldwide, intergovernmental, organisation, whose, principal, mission, was, to, maintain, world, peace, it, was, founded, on, 10, january, 1920, by, the, paris, peace, conference, that, ended, the, first, world, war, the, main, organization, ceased, operations, on, 18, april, 1946, when, many, of, its, components, were, relocated, into, the, new, united, nations, as, the, template, for, modern, global, governance, the, league, profoundly, shaped, the, modern, world, the, league, s, primary, goals, were, stated, in, its, eponymous, covenant, they, included, preventing, wars, through, collective, security, and, disarmament, and, settling, international, disputes, through, negotiation, and, arbitration, its, other, concerns, included, labour, conditions, just, treatment, of, native, inhabitants, human, and, drug, trafficking, the, arms, trade, global, health, prisoners, of, war, and, protection, of, minorities, in, europe, the, covenant, of, the, league, of, nations, was, signed, on, 28, june, 1919, as, part, i, of, the, treaty, of, versailles, and, it, became, effective, with, the, rest, of, the, treaty, on, 10, january, 1920, australia, was, granted, the, right, to, participate, as, an, autonomous, member, nation, marking, the, start, of, australian, independence, on, the, global, stage, the, first, meeting, of, the, council, of, the, league, took, place, on, 16, january, 1920, and, the, first, meeting, of, the, assembly, of, the, league, took, place, on, 15, november, 1920, in, 1919, u, s, president, woodrow, wilson, won, the, nobel, peace, prize, for, his, role, as, the, leading, architect, of, the, league, the, diplomatic, philosophy, behind, the, league, represented, a, fundamental, shift, from, the, preceding, hundred, years, the, league, lacked, its, own, armed, force, and, depended, on, the, victorious, allies, of, world, war, i, britain, france, italy, and, japan, were, the, initial, permanent, members, of, the, executive, council, to, enforce, its, resolutions, keep, to, its, economic, sanctions, or, provide, an, army, when, needed, the, great, powers, were, often, reluctant, to, do, so, sanctions, could, hurt, league, members, so, they, were, reluctant, to, comply, with, them, during, the, second, italo, ethiopian, war, when, the, league, accused, italian, soldiers, of, targeting, international, red, cross, and, red, crescent, movement, medical, tents, benito, mussolini, responded, that, the, league, is, very, well, when, sparrows, shout, but, no, good, at, all, when, eagles, fall, out, at, its, greatest, extent, from, 28, september, 1934, to, 23, february, 1935, it, had, 58, members, after, some, notable, successes, and, some, early, failures, in, the, 1920s, the, league, ultimately, proved, incapable, of, preventing, aggression, by, the, axis, powers, in, the, 1930s, its, credibility, was, weakened, because, the, united, states, never, joined, japan, and, germany, left, in, 1933, italy, left, in, 1937, and, spain, left, in, 1939, the, soviet, union, only, joined, in, 1934, and, was, expelled, in, 1939, after, invading, finland, furthermore, the, league, demonstrated, an, irresolute, approach, to, sanction, enforcement, for, fear, it, might, only, spark, further, conflict, further, decreasing, its, credibility, one, example, of, this, hesitancy, was, the, abyssinia, crisis, in, which, italy, s, sanctions, were, only, limited, from, the, outset, coal, and, oil, were, not, restricted, and, later, altogether, abandoned, despite, italy, being, declared, the, aggressors, in, the, conflict, the, onset, of, the, second, world, war, in, 1939, showed, that, the, league, had, failed, its, primary, purpose, it, was, largely, inactive, until, its, abolition, the, league, lasted, for, 26, years, the, united, nations, un, replaced, it, in, 1946, and, inherited, several, agencies, and, organisations, founded, by, the, league, current, scholarly, consensus, views, that, even, though, the, league, failed, to, achieve, its, main, goal, of, world, peace, it, did, manage, to, build, new, roads, towards, expanding, the, rule, of, law, across, the, globe, strengthened, the, concept, of, collective, security, gave, a, voice, to, smaller, nations, fostered, economic, stabilization, and, financial, stability, especially, in, central, europe, in, the, 1920s, helped, to, raise, awareness, of, problems, like, epidemics, slavery, child, labour, colonial, tyranny, refugee, crises, and, general, working, conditions, through, its, numerous, commissions, and, committees, and, paved, the, way, for, new, forms, of, statehood, as, the, mandate, system, put, the, colonial, powers, under, international, observation, professor, david, kennedy, portrays, the, league, as, a, unique, moment, when, international, affairs, were, institutionalised, as, opposed, to, the, pre, first, world, war, methods, of, law, and, politics, the, concept, of, a, peaceful, community, of, nations, had, been, proposed, as, early, as, 1795, when, immanuel, kant, s, perpetual, peace, a, philosophical, sketch, outlined, the, idea, of, a, league, of, nations, to, control, conflict, and, promote, peace, between, states, kant, argued, for, the, establishment, of, a, peaceful, world, community, not, in, a, sense, of, a, global, government, but, in, the, hope, that, each, state, would, declare, itself, a, free, state, that, respects, its, citizens, and, welcomes, foreign, visitors, as, fellow, rational, beings, thus, promoting, peaceful, society, worldwide, international, co, operation, to, promote, collective, security, originated, in, the, concert, of, europe, that, developed, after, the, napoleonic, wars, in, the, 19th, century, in, an, attempt, to, maintain, the, status, quo, between, european, states, and, so, avoid, war, by, 1910, international, law, developed, with, the, first, geneva, conventions, establishing, laws, dealing, with, humanitarian, relief, during, wartime, and, the, international, hague, conventions, of, 1899, and, 1907, governing, rules, of, war, and, the, peaceful, settlement, of, international, disputes, theodore, roosevelt, at, the, acceptance, for, his, nobel, prize, in, 1910, said, it, would, be, a, masterstroke, if, those, great, powers, honestly, bent, on, peace, would, form, a, league, of, peace, one, small, forerunner, of, the, league, of, nations, the, inter, parliamentary, union, ipu, was, formed, by, the, peace, activists, william, randal, cremer, and, fr, d, ric, passy, in, 1889, and, still, exists, as, an, international, body, focused, on, the, world, s, various, elected, legislative, bodies, the, ipu, was, founded, with, an, international, scope, with, a, third, of, the, members, of, parliaments, in, the, 24, countries, that, had, parliaments, serving, as, members, of, the, ipu, by, 1914, its, foundational, aims, were, to, encourage, governments, to, solve, international, disputes, by, peaceful, means, annual, conferences, were, established, to, help, governments, refine, the, process, of, international, arbitration, its, structure, was, designed, as, a, council, headed, by, a, president, which, would, later, be, reflected, in, the, structure, of, the, league, at, the, start, of, the, first, world, war, the, first, schemes, for, an, international, organisation, to, prevent, future, wars, began, to, gain, considerable, public, support, particularly, in, great, britain, and, the, united, states, goldsworthy, lowes, dickinson, a, british, political, scientist, coined, the, term, league, of, nations, in, 1914, and, drafted, a, scheme, for, its, organisation, together, with, lord, bryce, he, played, a, leading, role, in, the, founding, of, the, group, of, internationalist, pacifists, known, as, the, bryce, group, later, the, league, of, nations, union, the, group, became, steadily, more, influential, among, the, public, and, as, a, pressure, group, within, the, then, governing, liberal, party, in, dickinson, s, 1915, pamphlet, after, the, war, he, wrote, of, his, league, of, peace, as, being, essentially, an, organisation, for, arbitration, and, conciliation, he, felt, that, the, secret, diplomacy, of, the, early, twentieth, century, had, brought, about, war, and, thus, could, write, that, the, impossibility, of, war, i, believe, would, be, increased, in, proportion, as, the, issues, of, foreign, policy, should, be, known, to, and, controlled, by, public, opinion, the, proposals, of, the, bryce, group, were, circulated, widely, both, in, england, and, the, us, where, they, had, a, profound, influence, on, the, nascent, international, movement, in, january, 1915, a, peace, conference, directed, by, jane, addams, was, held, in, the, neutral, united, states, the, delegates, adopted, a, platform, calling, for, creation, of, international, bodies, with, administrative, and, legislative, powers, to, develop, a, permanent, league, of, neutral, nations, to, work, for, peace, and, disarmament, within, months, a, call, was, made, for, an, international, women, s, conference, to, be, held, in, the, hague, coordinated, by, mia, boissevain, aletta, jacobs, and, rosa, manus, the, congress, which, opened, on, 28, april, 1915, was, attended, by, 1, 136, participants, from, neutral, nations, and, resulted, in, the, establishment, of, an, organization, which, would, become, the, women, s, international, league, for, peace, and, freedom, wilpf, at, the, close, of, the, conference, two, delegations, of, women, were, dispatched, to, meet, european, heads, of, state, over, the, next, several, months, they, secured, agreement, from, reluctant, foreign, ministers, who, overall, felt, that, such, a, body, would, be, ineffective, but, agreed, to, participate, in, or, not, impede, creation, of, a, neutral, mediating, body, if, other, nations, agreed, and, if, president, woodrow, wilson, would, initiate, a, body, in, the, midst, of, the, war, wilson, refused, in, 1915, a, body, similar, to, the, bryce, group, was, set, up, in, the, united, states, led, by, former, president, william, howard, taft, it, was, called, the, league, to, enforce, peace, it, advocated, the, use, of, arbitration, in, conflict, resolution, and, the, imposition, of, sanctions, on, aggressive, countries, none, of, these, early, organisations, envisioned, a, continuously, functioning, body, with, the, exception, of, the, fabian, society, in, england, they, maintained, a, legalistic, approach, that, would, limit, the, international, body, to, a, court, of, justice, the, fabians, were, the, first, to, argue, for, a, council, of, states, necessarily, the, great, powers, who, would, adjudicate, world, affairs, and, for, the, creation, of, a, permanent, secretariat, to, enhance, international, co, operation, across, a, range, of, activities, in, the, course, of, the, diplomatic, efforts, surrounding, world, war, i, both, sides, had, to, clarify, their, long, term, war, aims, by, 1916, in, britain, fighting, on, the, side, of, the, allies, and, in, the, neutral, united, states, long, range, thinkers, had, begun, to, design, a, unified, international, organisation, to, prevent, future, wars, historian, peter, yearwood, argues, that, when, the, new, coalition, government, of, david, lloyd, george, took, power, in, december, 1916, there, was, widespread, discussion, among, intellectuals, and, diplomats, of, the, desirability, of, establishing, such, an, organisation, when, lloyd, george, was, challenged, by, wilson, to, state, his, position, with, an, eye, on, the, postwar, situation, he, endorsed, such, an, organisation, wilson, himself, included, in, his, fourteen, points, in, january, 1918, a, league, of, nations, to, ensure, peace, and, justice, british, foreign, secretary, arthur, balfour, argued, that, as, a, condition, of, durable, peace, behind, international, law, and, behind, all, treaty, arrangements, for, preventing, or, limiting, hostilities, some, form, of, international, sanction, should, be, devised, which, would, give, pause, to, the, hardiest, aggressor, the, war, had, had, a, profound, impact, affecting, the, social, political, and, economic, systems, of, europe, and, inflicting, psychological, and, physical, damage, several, empires, collapsed, first, the, russian, empire, in, february, 1917, followed, by, the, german, empire, austro, hungarian, empire, and, ottoman, empire, anti, war, sentiment, rose, across, the, world, the, first, world, war, was, described, as, the, war, to, end, all, wars, and, its, possible, causes, were, vigorously, investigated, the, causes, identified, included, arms, races, alliances, militaristic, nationalism, secret, diplomacy, and, the, freedom, of, sovereign, states, to, enter, into, war, for, their, own, benefit, one, proposed, remedy, was, the, creation, of, an, international, organisation, whose, aim, was, to, prevent, future, war, through, disarmament, open, diplomacy, international, co, operation, restrictions, on, the, right, to, wage, war, and, penalties, that, made, war, unattractive, in, london, balfour, commissioned, the, first, official, report, into, the, matter, in, early, 1918, under, the, initiative, of, lord, robert, cecil, the, british, committee, was, finally, appointed, in, february, 1918, it, was, led, by, walter, phillimore, and, became, known, as, the, phillimore, committee, but, also, included, eyre, crowe, william, tyrrell, and, cecil, hurst, the, recommendations, of, the, so, called, phillimore, commission, included, the, establishment, of, a, conference, of, allied, states, that, would, arbitrate, disputes, and, impose, sanctions, on, offending, states, the, proposals, were, approved, by, the, british, government, and, much, of, the, commission, s, results, were, later, incorporated, into, the, covenant, of, the, league, of, nations, the, french, authorities, also, drafted, a, much, more, far, reaching, proposal, in, june, 1918, they, advocated, annual, meetings, of, a, council, to, settle, all, disputes, as, well, as, an, international, army, to, enforce, its, decisions, american, president, woodrow, wilson, instructed, edward, m, house, to, draft, a, us, plan, which, reflected, wilson, s, own, idealistic, views, first, articulated, in, the, fourteen, points, of, january, 1918, as, well, as, the, work, of, the, phillimore, commission, the, outcome, of, house, s, work, and, wilson, s, own, first, draft, proposed, the, termination, of, unethical, state, behaviour, including, forms, of, espionage, and, dishonesty, methods, of, compulsion, against, recalcitrant, states, would, include, severe, measures, such, as, blockading, and, closing, the, frontiers, of, that, power, to, commerce, or, intercourse, with, any, part, of, the, world, and, to, use, any, force, that, may, be, necessary, the, two, principal, drafters, and, architects, of, the, covenant, of, the, league, of, nations, were, the, british, politician, lord, robert, cecil, and, the, south, african, statesman, jan, smuts, smuts, s, proposals, included, the, creation, of, a, council, of, the, great, powers, as, permanent, members, and, a, non, permanent, selection, of, the, minor, states, he, also, proposed, the, creation, of, a, mandate, system, for, captured, colonies, of, the, central, powers, during, the, war, cecil, focused, on, the, administrative, side, and, proposed, annual, council, meetings, and, quadrennial, meetings, for, the, assembly, of, all, members, he, also, argued, for, a, large, and, permanent, secretariat, to, carry, out, the, league, s, administrative, duties, according, to, historian, patricia, clavin, cecil, and, the, british, continued, their, leadership, of, the, development, of, a, rules, based, global, order, into, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, with, a, primary, focus, on, the, league, of, nations, the, british, goal, was, to, systematize, and, normalize, the, economic, and, social, relations, between, states, markets, and, civil, society, they, gave, priority, to, business, and, banking, issues, but, also, considered, the, needs, of, ordinary, women, children, and, the, family, as, well, they, moved, beyond, high, level, intellectual, discussions, and, set, up, local, organizations, to, support, the, league, the, british, were, particularly, active, in, setting, up, junior, branches, for, secondary, students, the, league, of, nations, was, relatively, more, universal, and, inclusive, in, its, membership, and, structure, than, previous, international, organisations, but, the, organisation, enshrined, racial, hierarchy, by, curtailing, the, right, to, self, determination, and, prevented, decolonization, at, the, paris, peace, conference, in, 1919, wilson, cecil, and, smuts, all, put, forward, their, draft, proposals, after, lengthy, negotiations, between, the, delegates, the, hurst, miller, draft, was, finally, produced, as, a, basis, for, the, covenant, after, more, negotiation, and, compromise, the, delegates, finally, approved, of, the, proposal, to, create, the, league, of, nations, french, soci, t, des, nations, german, v, lkerbund, on, 25, january, 1919, the, final, covenant, of, the, league, of, nations, was, drafted, by, a, special, commission, and, the, league, was, established, by, part, i, of, the, treaty, of, versailles, signed, on, 28, june, 1919, french, women, s, rights, advocates, invited, international, feminists, to, participate, in, a, parallel, conference, to, the, paris, conference, in, hopes, that, they, could, gain, permission, to, participate, in, the, official, conference, the, inter, allied, women, s, conference, asked, to, be, allowed, to, submit, suggestions, to, the, peace, negotiations, and, commissions, and, were, granted, the, right, to, sit, on, commissions, dealing, specifically, with, women, and, children, though, they, asked, for, enfranchisement, and, full, legal, protection, under, the, law, equal, with, men, those, rights, were, ignored, women, won, the, right, to, serve, in, all, capacities, including, as, staff, or, delegates, in, the, league, of, nations, organization, they, also, won, a, declaration, that, member, nations, should, prevent, trafficking, of, women, and, children, and, should, equally, support, humane, conditions, for, children, women, and, men, labourers, at, the, z, rich, peace, conference, held, between, 17, and, 19, may, 1919, the, women, of, the, wilpf, condemned, the, terms, of, the, treaty, of, versailles, for, both, its, punitive, measures, as, well, as, its, failure, to, provide, for, condemnation, of, violence, and, exclusion, of, women, from, civil, and, political, participation, upon, reading, the, rules, of, procedure, for, the, league, of, nations, catherine, marshall, a, british, suffragist, discovered, that, the, guidelines, were, completely, undemocratic, and, they, were, modified, based, on, her, suggestion, the, league, would, be, made, up, of, a, general, assembly, representing, all, member, states, an, executive, council, with, membership, limited, to, major, powers, and, a, permanent, secretariat, member, states, were, expected, to, respect, and, preserve, as, against, external, aggression, the, territorial, integrity, of, other, members, and, to, disarm, to, the, lowest, point, consistent, with, domestic, safety, all, states, were, required, to, submit, complaints, for, arbitration, or, judicial, inquiry, before, going, to, war, the, executive, council, would, create, a, permanent, court, of, international, justice, to, make, judgements, on, the, disputes, despite, wilson, s, efforts, to, establish, and, promote, the, league, for, which, he, was, awarded, the, nobel, peace, prize, in, october, 1919, the, united, states, never, joined, senate, republicans, led, by, henry, cabot, lodge, wanted, a, league, with, the, reservation, that, only, congress, could, take, the, u, s, into, war, lodge, gained, a, majority, of, senators, and, wilson, refused, to, allow, a, compromise, the, senate, voted, on, the, ratification, on, 19, march, 1920, and, the, 49, 35, vote, fell, short, of, the, needed, 2, 3, majority, the, league, held, its, first, council, meeting, in, paris, on, 16, january, 1920, six, days, after, the, versailles, treaty, and, the, covenant, of, the, league, of, nations, came, into, force, on, 1, november, 1920, the, headquarters, of, the, league, was, moved, from, london, to, geneva, where, the, first, general, assembly, was, held, on, 15, november, 1920, geneva, made, sense, as, an, ideal, city, for, the, league, since, switzerland, had, been, a, neutral, country, for, centuries, and, was, already, the, headquarters, for, the, international, red, cross, its, strong, democracy, and, location, in, central, europe, made, it, a, good, choice, for, the, nations, of, the, world, support, for, geneva, as, the, selection, came, from, swiss, federal, councillor, gustave, ador, and, economist, william, rappard, the, palais, wilson, on, geneva, s, western, lakeshore, named, after, woodrow, wilson, was, the, league, s, first, permanent, home, the, covenant, had, ambiguities, as, carole, fink, points, out, there, was, not, a, good, fit, between, wilson, s, revolutionary, conception, of, the, league, as, a, solid, replacement, for, a, corrupt, alliance, system, a, guardian, of, international, order, and, protector, of, small, states, versus, lloyd, george, s, desire, for, a, cheap, self, enforcing, peace, such, as, had, been, maintained, by, the, old, and, more, fluid, concert, of, europe, furthermore, the, league, according, to, carole, fink, was, deliberately, excluded, from, such, great, power, prerogatives, as, freedom, of, the, seas, and, naval, disarmament, the, monroe, doctrine, and, the, internal, affairs, of, the, french, and, british, empires, and, inter, allied, debts, and, german, reparations, not, to, mention, the, allied, intervention, and, the, settlement, of, borders, with, soviet, russia, although, the, united, states, never, joined, unofficial, observers, became, more, and, more, involved, especially, in, the, 1930s, american, philanthropies, became, heavily, involved, especially, the, rockefeller, foundation, it, made, major, grants, designed, to, build, up, the, technical, expertise, of, the, league, staff, ludovic, tourn, s, argues, that, by, the, 1930s, the, foundations, had, changed, the, league, from, a, parliament, of, nations, to, a, modern, think, tank, that, used, specialized, expertise, to, provide, an, in, depth, impartial, analysis, of, international, issues, the, official, languages, of, the, league, of, nations, were, french, and, english, during, the, 1939, new, york, world, s, fair, a, semi, official, flag, and, emblem, for, the, league, of, nations, emerged, two, five, pointed, stars, within, a, blue, pentagon, they, symbolised, the, earth, s, five, continents, and, five, races, a, bow, at, the, top, displayed, the, english, name, league, of, nations, while, another, at, the, bottom, showed, the, french, soci, t, des, nations, the, league, consisted, of, 42, founding, members, in, november, 1920, six, other, states, joined, in, its, founding, year, by, december, 1920, and, seven, more, joined, by, september, 1924, bringing, the, league, s, size, to, 55, costa, rica, withdrew, in, december, 1924, making, it, the, member, to, have, most, quickly, withdrawn, and, brazil, became, the, first, founding, member, to, withdraw, in, june, 1926, germany, under, the, weimar, republic, was, admitted, to, the, league, of, nations, through, a, resolution, passed, on, 8, september, 1926, the, league, s, size, remained, at, 54, for, the, next, five, years, through, the, first, half, of, the, 1930s, six, more, states, joined, including, iraq, in, 1932, newly, independent, from, a, league, of, nations, mandate, and, the, soviet, union, on, 18, september, 1934, but, the, empire, of, japan, and, germany, under, hitler, withdrew, in, 1933, this, marked, the, league, s, largest, extent, at, 58, member, states, in, december, 1920, argentina, quit, became, absent, from, all, sessions, and, votes, without, formally, withdrawing, on, rejection, of, an, argentine, resolution, that, all, sovereign, states, would, be, admitted, to, the, league, it, resumed, its, participation, in, september, 1933, the, league, s, membership, declined, through, the, second, half, of, the, 1930s, as, it, weakened, between, 1935, and, the, start, of, world, war, ii, in, europe, in, september, 1939, only, egypt, joined, becoming, the, last, state, to, join, 11, members, left, and, 3, members, ceased, to, exist, or, fell, under, military, occupation, ethiopia, austria, and, czechoslovakia, the, soviet, union, was, expelled, on, 14, december, 1939, for, invading, finland, as, one, of, the, last, acts, of, the, league, before, it, ceased, functioning, the, main, constitutional, organs, of, the, league, were, the, assembly, the, council, and, the, permanent, secretariat, it, also, had, two, essential, wings, the, permanent, court, of, international, justice, and, the, international, labour, organization, in, addition, there, were, several, auxiliary, agencies, and, bodies, each, organ, s, budget, was, allocated, by, the, assembly, the, league, was, supported, financially, by, its, member, states, the, relations, between, the, assembly, and, the, council, and, the, competencies, of, each, were, for, the, most, part, not, explicitly, defined, each, body, could, deal, with, any, matter, within, the, sphere, of, competence, of, the, league, or, affecting, peace, in, the, world, particular, questions, or, tasks, might, be, referred, to, either, unanimity, was, required, for,

of, the, former, german, colonies, in, africa, and, the, pacific, and, the, several, arabic, speaking, provinces, of, the, ottoman, empire, many, british, and, french, leaders, wanted, to, annex, the, defeated, central, powers, colonies, but, u, s, president, woodrow, wilson, strongly, insisted, that, instead, of, annexation, these, territories, should, be, assisted, under, league, of, nations, supervision, in, achieving, self, governance, and, eventual, independence, depending, on, the, inhabitants, choices, the, paris, peace, conference, compromised, with, wilson, by, adopting, the, principle, that, these, territories, should, be, administered, by, different, governments, on, behalf, of, the, league, a, system, of, national, responsibility, subject, to, international, supervision, this, plan, defined, as, the, mandate, system, was, adopted, by, the, council, of, ten, the, heads, of, government, and, foreign, ministers, of, the, main, allied, powers, britain, france, the, united, states, italy, and, japan, on, 30, january, 1919, and, transmitted, to, the, league, of, nations, league, of, nations, mandates, were, established, under, article, 22, of, the,

certain, communities, that, had, reached, a, stage, of, development, where, their, existence, as, independent, nations, can, be, provisionally, recognised, subject, to, the, rendering, of, administrative, advice, and, assistance, by, a, mandatory, until, such, time, as, they, are, able, to, stand, alone, the, wishes, of, these, communities, must, be, a, principal, consideration, in, the, selection, of, the, mandatory, the, b, mandates, were, applied, to, the, former, german, colonies, that, the, league, took, responsibility, for, after, the, first, world, war, these, were, described, as, peoples, that, the, league, said, were, at, such, a, stage, that, the, mandatory, must, be, responsible, for, the, administration, of, the, territory, under, conditions, which, will, guarantee, freedom, of, conscience, and, religion, subject, only, to, the, maintenance, of, public, order, and, morals, the, prohibition, of, abuses, such, as, the, slave, trade, the, arms, traffic, and, the, liquor, traffic, and, the, prevention, of, the, establishment, of, fortifications, or, military, and, naval, bases, and, of, military, training, of, the, natives, for, other, than, police, purposes, and, the, defence, of, territory, and, will, also, secure, equal, opportunities, for, the, trade, and, commerce, of, other, members, of, the, league, south, west, africa, and, certain, south, pacific, islands, were, administered, by, league, members, under, c, mandates, these, were, classified, as, territories, which, owing, to, the, sparseness, of, their, population, or, their, small, size, or, their, remoteness, from, the, centres, of, civilisation, or, their, geographical, contiguity, to, the, territory, of, the, mandatory, and, other, circumstances, can, be, best, administered, under, the, laws, of, the, mandatory, as, integral, portions, of, its, territory, subject, to, the, safeguards, above, mentioned, in, the, interests, of, the, indigenous, population, the, territories, were, governed, by, mandatory, powers, such, as, the, united, kingdom, in, the, case, of, the, mandate, of, palestine, and, the, union, of, south, africa, in, the, case, of, south, west, africa, until, the, territories, were, deemed, capable, of, self, government, fourteen, mandate, territories, were, divided, up, among, seven, mandatory, powers, the, united, kingdom, the, union, of, south, africa, france, belgium, new, zealand, australia, and, japan, with, the, exception, of, the, kingdom, of, iraq, which, joined, the, league, on, 3, october, 1932, most, of, these, territories, did, not, begin, to, gain, their, independence, until, after, the, second, world, war, in, a, process, that, did, not, end, until, 1990, following, the, demise, of, the, league, most, of, the, remaining, mandates, became, united, nations, trust, territories, in, addition, to, the, mandates, the, league, itself, governed, the, territory, of, the, saar, basin, for, 15, years, before, it, was, returned, to, germany, following, a, plebiscite, and, the, free, city, of, danzig, now, gda, sk, poland, from, 15, november, 1920, to, 1, september, 1939, the, aftermath, of, the, first, world, war, left, many, issues, to, be, settled, including, the, exact, position, of, national, boundaries, and, which, country, particular, regions, would, join, most, of, these, questions, were, handled, by, the, victorious, allied, powers, in, bodies, such, as, the, allied, supreme, council, the, allies, tended, to, refer, only, particularly, difficult, matters, to, the, league, this, meant, that, during, the, early, interwar, period, the, league, played, little, part, in, resolving, the, turmoil, resulting, from, the, war, the, questions, the, league, considered, in, its, early, years, included, those, designated, by, the, paris, peace, treaties, as, the, league, developed, its, role, expanded, and, by, the, middle, of, the, 1920s, it, had, become, the, centre, of, international, activity, this, change, can, be, seen, in, the, relationship, between, the, league, and, non, members, the, united, states, and, the, soviet, union, for, example, increasingly, worked, with, the, league, during, the, second, half, of, the, 1920s, france, britain, and, germany, were, all, using, the, league, of, nations, as, the, focus, of, their, diplomatic, activity, and, each, of, their, foreign, secretaries, attended, league, meetings, at, geneva, during, this, period, they, also, used, the, league, s, machinery, to, try, to, improve, relations, and, settle, their, differences, land, is, a, collection, of, around, 6, 500, islands, in, the, baltic, sea, midway, between, sweden, and, finland, the, islands, are, almost, exclusively, swedish, speaking, but, in, 1809, the, land, islands, along, with, finland, were, taken, by, imperial, russia, in, december, 1917, during, the, turmoil, of, the, russian, october, revolution, finland, declared, its, independence, but, most, of, the, landers, wished, to, rejoin, sweden, the, finnish, government, considered, the, islands, to, be, a, part, of, their, new, nation, as, the, russians, had, included, land, in, the, grand, duchy, of, finland, formed, in, 1809, by, 1920, the, dispute, had, escalated, to, the, point, that, there, was, danger, of, war, the, british, government, referred, the, problem, to, the, league, s, council, but, finland, would, not, let, the, league, intervene, as, they, considered, it, an, internal, matter, the, league, created, a, small, panel, to, decide, if, it, should, investigate, the, matter, and, with, an, affirmative, response, a, neutral, commission, was, created, in, june, 1921, the, league, announced, its, decision, the, islands, were, to, remain, a, part, of, finland, but, with, guaranteed, protection, of, the, islanders, including, demilitarisation, with, sweden, s, reluctant, agreement, this, became, the, first, european, international, agreement, concluded, directly, through, the, league, the, allied, powers, referred, the, problem, of, upper, silesia, to, the, league, after, they, had, been, unable, to, resolve, the, territorial, dispute, between, poland, and, germany, in, 1919, poland, voiced, a, claim, to, upper, silesia, which, had, been, part, of, prussia, the, treaty, of, versailles, had, recommended, a, plebiscite, in, upper, silesia, to, determine, whether, the, territory, should, become, part, of, germany, or, poland, complaints, about, the, attitude, of, the, german, authorities, led, to, rioting, and, eventually, to, the, first, two, silesian, uprisings, 1919, and, 1920, a, plebiscite, took, place, on, 20, march, 1921, with, 59, 6, per, cent, around, 500, 000, of, the, votes, cast, in, favour, of, joining, germany, but, poland, claimed, the, conditions, surrounding, it, had, been, unfair, this, result, led, to, the, third, silesian, uprising, in, 1921, on, 12, august, 1921, the, league, was, asked, to, settle, the, matter, the, council, created, a, commission, with, representatives, from, belgium, brazil, china, and, spain, to, study, the, situation, the, committee, recommended, that, upper, silesia, be, divided, between, poland, and, germany, according, to, the, preferences, shown, in, the, plebiscite, and, that, the, two, sides, should, decide, the, details, of, the, interaction, between, the, two, areas, for, example, whether, goods, should, pass, freely, over, the, border, due, to, the, economic, and, industrial, interdependence, of, the, two, areas, in, november, 1921, a, conference, was, held, in, geneva, to, negotiate, a, convention, between, germany, and, poland, a, final, settlement, was, reached, after, five, meetings, in, which, most, of, the, area, was, given, to, germany, but, with, the, polish, section, containing, the, majority, of, the, region, s, mineral, resources, and, much, of, its, industry, when, this, agreement, became, public, in, may, 1922, bitter, resentment, was, expressed, in, germany, but, the, treaty, was, still, ratified, by, both, countries, the, settlement, produced, peace, in, the, area, until, the, beginning, of, the, second, world, war, the, frontiers, of, the, principality, of, albania, had, not, been, set, during, the, paris, peace, conference, in, 1919, as, they, were, left, for, the, league, to, decide, they, had, not, yet, been, determined, by, september, 1921, creating, an, unstable, situation, greek, troops, conducted, military, operations, in, the, south, of, albania, kingdom, of, serbs, croats, and, slovenes, yugoslav, forces, became, engaged, after, clashes, with, albanian, tribesmen, in, the, northern, part, of, the, country, the, league, sent, a, commission, of, representatives, from, various, powers, to, the, region, in, november, 1921, the, league, decided, that, the, frontiers, of, albania, should, be, the, same, as, they, had, been, in, 1913, with, three, minor, changes, that, favoured, yugoslavia, yugoslav, forces, withdrew, a, few, weeks, later, albeit, under, protest, the, borders, of, albania, again, became, the, cause, of, international, conflict, when, italian, general, enrico, tellini, and, four, of, his, assistants, were, ambushed, and, killed, on, 27, august, 1923, while, marking, out, the, newly, decided, border, between, greece, and, albania, italian, leader, benito, mussolini, was, incensed, and, demanded, that, a, commission, investigate, the, incident, within, five, days, whatever, the, results, of, the, investigation, mussolini, insisted, that, the, greek, government, pay, italy, lire, 50, million, in, reparations, the, greeks, said, they, would, not, pay, unless, it, was, proved, that, the, crime, was, committed, by, greeks, mussolini, sent, a, warship, to, shell, the, greek, island, of, corfu, and, italian, forces, occupied, the, island, on, 31, august, 1923, this, contravened, the, league, s, covenant, so, greece, appealed, to, the, league, to, deal, with, the, situation, the, allies, agreed, at, mussolini, s, insistence, that, the, conference, of, ambassadors, should, be, responsible, for, resolving, the, dispute, because, it, was, the, conference, that, had, appointed, general, tellini, the, league, council, examined, the, dispute, but, then, passed, on, their, findings, to, the, conference, of, ambassadors, to, make, the, final, decision, the, conference, accepted, most, of, the, league, s, recommendations, forcing, greece, to, pay, fifty, million, lire, to, italy, even, though, those, who, committed, the, crime, were, never, discovered, italian, forces, then, withdrew, from, corfu, the, port, city, of, memel, now, klaip, da, and, the, surrounding, area, with, a, predominantly, german, population, was, under, provisional, entente, control, according, to, article, 99, of, the, treaty, of, versailles, the, french, and, polish, governments, favoured, turning, memel, into, an, international, city, while, lithuania, wanted, to, annex, the, area, by, 1923, the, fate, of, the, area, had, still, not, been, decided, prompting, lithuanian, forces, to, invade, in, january, 1923, and, seize, the, port, after, the, allies, failed, to, reach, an, agreement, with, lithuania, they, referred, the, matter, to, the, league, of, nations, in, december, 1923, the, league, council, appointed, a, commission, of, inquiry, the, commission, chose, to, cede, memel, to, lithuania, and, give, the, area, autonomous, rights, the, klaip, da, convention, was, approved, by, the, league, council, on, 14, march, 1924, and, then, by, the, allied, powers, and, lithuania, in, 1939, germany, retook, the, region, following, the, rise, of, the, nazis, and, an, ultimatum, to, lithuania, demanding, the, return, of, the, region, under, threat, of, war, the, league, of, nations, failed, to, prevent, the, secession, of, the, memel, region, to, germany, with, league, oversight, the, sanjak, of, alexandretta, in, the, french, mandate, of, syria, was, given, autonomy, in, 1937, renamed, hatay, its, parliament, declared, independence, as, the, republic, of, hatay, in, september, 1938, after, elections, the, previous, month, it, was, annexed, by, turkey, with, french, consent, in, mid, 1939, the, league, resolved, a, dispute, between, the, kingdom, of, iraq, and, the, republic, of, turkey, over, control, of, the, former, ottoman, province, of, mosul, in, 1926, according, to, the, british, who, had, been, awarded, a, league, of, nations, mandate, over, iraq, in, 1920, and, therefore, represented, iraq, in, its, foreign, affairs, mosul, belonged, to, iraq, on, the, other, hand, the, new, turkish, republic, claimed, the, province, as, part, of, its, historic, heartland, a, league, of, nations, commission, of, inquiry, with, belgian, hungarian, and, swedish, members, was, sent, to, the, region, in, 1924, it, found, that, the, people, of, mosul, did, not, want, to, be, part, of, either, turkey, or, iraq, but, if, they, had, to, choose, they, would, pick, iraq, in, 1925, the, commission, recommended, that, the, region, stay, part, of, iraq, under, the, condition, that, the, british, hold, the, mandate, over, iraq, for, another, 25, years, to, ensure, the, autonomous, rights, of, the, kurdish, population, the, league, council, adopted, the, recommendation, and, decided, on, 16, december, 1925, to, award, mosul, to, iraq, although, turkey, had, accepted, the, league, of, nations, arbitration, in, the, treaty, of, lausanne, 1923, it, rejected, the, decision, questioning, the, council, s, authority, the, matter, was, referred, to, the, permanent, court, of, international, justice, which, ruled, that, when, the, council, made, a, unanimous, decision, it, must, be, accepted, nonetheless, britain, iraq, and, turkey, ratified, a, separate, treaty, on, 5, june, 1926, that, mostly, followed, the, decision, of, the, league, council, and, also, assigned, mosul, to, iraq, it, was, agreed, that, iraq, could, still, apply, for, league, membership, within, 25, years, and, that, the, mandate, would, end, upon, its, admission, after, the, first, world, war, poland, and, lithuania, both, regained, their, independence, but, soon, became, immersed, in, territorial, disputes, during, the, polish, soviet, war, lithuania, signed, the, moscow, peace, treaty, with, the, soviet, russia, that, laid, out, lithuania, s, frontiers, this, agreement, gave, lithuanians, control, of, the, city, of, vilnius, lithuanian, vilnius, polish, wilno, the, old, lithuanian, capital, but, a, city, with, a, majority, polish, population, this, heightened, tension, between, lithuania, and, poland, and, led, to, fears, that, they, would, resume, the, polish, lithuanian, war, and, on, 7, october, 1920, the, league, negotiated, the, suwa, ki, agreement, establishing, a, cease, fire, and, a, demarcation, line, between, the, two, nations, on, 9, october, 1920, general, lucjan, eligowski, commanding, a, polish, military, force, in, contravention, of, the, suwa, ki, agreement, took, the, city, and, established, the, republic, of, central, lithuania, after, a, request, for, assistance, from, lithuania, the, league, council, called, for, poland, s, withdrawal, from, the, area, the, polish, government, indicated, they, would, comply, but, instead, reinforced, the, city, with, more, polish, troops, this, prompted, the, league, to, decide, that, the, future, of, vilnius, should, be, determined, by, its, residents, in, a, plebiscite, and, that, the, polish, forces, should, withdraw, and, be, replaced, by, an, international, force, organised, by, the, league, the, plan, was, met, with, resistance, in, poland, lithuania, and, the, soviet, russia, which, opposed, any, international, force, in, lithuania, in, march, 1921, the, league, abandoned, plans, for, the, plebiscite, after, unsuccessful, proposals, by, paul, hymans, to, create, a, federation, between, poland, and, lithuania, which, was, intended, as, a, reincarnation, of, the, former, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, which, the, two, nations, had, shared, before, losing, their, independence, vilnius, and, the, surrounding, area, was, formally, annexed, by, poland, in, march, 1922, after, lithuania, took, over, the, klaip, da, region, the, allied, conference, set, the, frontier, between, lithuania, and, poland, leaving, vilnius, within, poland, on, 14, march, 1923, lithuanian, authorities, refused, to, accept, the, decision, and, officially, remained, in, a, state, of, war, with, poland, until, 1927, it, was, not, until, the, 1938, polish, ultimatum, that, lithuania, restored, diplomatic, relations, with, poland, and, thus, de, facto, accepted, the, borders, there, were, several, border, conflicts, between, colombia, and, peru, in, the, early, part, of, the, 20th, century, and, in, 1922, their, governments, signed, the, salom, n, lozano, treaty, in, an, attempt, to, resolve, them, as, part, of, this, treaty, the, border, town, of, leticia, and, its, surrounding, area, was, ceded, from, peru, to, colombia, giving, colombia, access, to, the, amazon, river, on, 1, september, 1932, business, leaders, from, peruvian, rubber, and, sugar, industries, who, had, lost, land, as, a, result, organised, an, armed, takeover, of, leticia, at, first, the, peruvian, government, did, not, recognise, the, military, takeover, but, president, of, peru, luis, s, nchez, cerro, decided, to, resist, a, colombian, re, occupation, the, peruvian, army, occupied, leticia, leading, to, an, armed, conflict, between, the, two, nations, after, months, of, diplomatic, negotiations, the, governments, accepted, mediation, by, the, league, of, nations, and, their, representatives, presented, their, cases, before, the, council, a, provisional, peace, agreement, signed, by, both, parties, in, may, 1933, provided, for, the, league, to, assume, control, of, the, disputed, territory, while, bilateral, negotiations, proceeded, in, may, 1934, a, final, peace, agreement, was, signed, resulting, in, the, return, of, leticia, to, colombia, a, formal, apology, from, peru, for, the, 1932, invasion, demilitarisation, of, the, area, around, leticia, free, navigation, on, the, amazon, and, putumayo, rivers, and, a, pledge, of, non, aggression, saar, was, a, province, formed, from, parts, of, prussia, and, the, rhenish, palatinate, and, placed, under, league, control, by, the, treaty, of, versailles, a, plebiscite, was, to, be, held, after, fifteen, years, of, league, rule, to, determine, whether, the, province, should, belong, to, germany, or, france, when, the, referendum, was, held, in, 1935, 90, 3, per, cent, of, voters, supported, becoming, part, of, germany, which, was, quickly, approved, by, the, league, council, in, addition, to, territorial, disputes, the, league, also, tried, to, intervene, in, other, conflicts, between, and, within, nations, among, its, successes, were, its, fight, against, the, international, trade, in, opium, and, sexual, slavery, and, its, work, to, alleviate, the, plight, of, refugees, particularly, in, turkey, in, the, period, up, to, 1926, one, of, its, innovations, in, this, latter, area, was, the, 1922, introduction, of, the, nansen, passport, which, was, the, first, internationally, recognised, identity, card, for, stateless, refugees, after, an, incident, involving, sentries, on, the, greek, bulgarian, border, in, october, 1925, fighting, began, between, the, two, countries, three, days, after, the, initial, incident, greek, troops, invaded, bulgaria, the, bulgarian, government, ordered, its, troops, to, make, only, token, resistance, and, evacuated, between, ten, thousand, and, fifteen, thousand, people, from, the, border, region, trusting, the, league, to, settle, the, dispute, the, league, condemned, the, greek, invasion, and, called, for, both, greek, withdrawal, and, compensation, to, bulgaria, following, accusations, of, forced, labour, on, the, large, american, owned, firestone, rubber, plantation, and, american, accusations, of, slave, trading, the, liberian, government, asked, the, league, to, launch, an, investigation, the, resulting, commission, was, jointly, appointed, by, the, league, the, united, states, and, liberia, in, 1930, a, league, report, confirmed, the, presence, of, slavery, and, forced, labour, the, report, implicated, many, government, officials, in, the, selling, of, contract, labour, and, recommended, that, they, be, replaced, by, europeans, or, americans, which, generated, anger, within, liberia, and, led, to, the, resignation, of, president, charles, d, b, king, and, his, vice, president, the, liberian, government, outlawed, forced, labour, and, slavery, and, asked, for, american, help, in, social, reforms, the, mukden, incident, also, known, as, the, manchurian, incident, was, a, decisive, setback, that, weakened, the, league, because, its, major, members, refused, to, tackle, japanese, aggression, japan, itself, withdrew, under, the, agreed, terms, of, the, twenty, one, demands, with, china, the, japanese, government, had, the, right, to, station, its, troops, in, the, area, around, the, south, manchurian, railway, a, major, trade, route, between, china, and, korea, then, a, japanese, colony, in, the, chinese, region, of, manchuria, in, september, 1931, a, section, of, the, railway, was, lightly, damaged, by, the, japanese, kwantung, army, as, a, pretext, for, an, invasion, of, manchuria, the, japanese, army, claimed, that, chinese, soldiers, had, sabotaged, the, railway, and, in, apparent, retaliation, acting, contrary, to, orders, from, tokyo, occupied, all, of, manchuria, they, renamed, the, area, manchukuo, and, on, 9, march, 1932, set, up, a, puppet, government, with, puyi, the, former, emperor, of, china, as, its, executive, head, the, league, of, nations, sent, observers, the, lytton, report, appeared, a, year, later, october, 1932, it, refused, to, recognize, manchukuo, and, demanded, manchuria, be, returned, to, china, the, report, passed, 42, 1, in, the, assembly, in, 1933, only, japan, voting, against, but, instead, of, removing, its, troops, from, china, japan, withdrew, from, the, league, in, the, end, as, british, historian, charles, mowat, argued, collective, security, was, dead, the, league, failed, to, prevent, the, 1932, war, between, bolivia, and, paraguay, over, the, arid, gran, chaco, region, although, the, region, was, sparsely, populated, it, contained, the, paraguay, river, which, would, have, given, either, landlocked, country, access, to, the, atlantic, ocean, and, there, was, also, speculation, later, proved, incorrect, that, the, chaco, would, be, a, rich, source, of, petroleum, border, skirmishes, throughout, the, late, 1920s, culminated, in, an, all, out, war, in, 1932, when, the, bolivian, army, attacked, the, paraguayans, at, fort, carlos, antonio, l, pez, at, lake, pitiantuta, the, war, was, a, disaster, for, both, sides, causing, 57, 000, casualties, for, bolivia, whose, population, was, around, three, million, and, 36, 000, dead, for, paraguay, whose, population, was, approximately, one, million, it, also, brought, both, countries, to, the, brink, of, economic, disaster, by, the, time, a, ceasefire, was, negotiated, on, 12, june, 1935, paraguay, had, seized, control, of, most, of, the, region, as, was, later, recognised, by, the, 1938, truce, initially, both, sides, refused, to, allow, the, league, to, conduct, an, inquiry, until, november, 1933, over, a, year, after, the, start, of, the, war, as, a, result, the, league, did, not, formally, invoke, article, 16, to, apply, sanctions, the, pan, american, conference, offered, to, mediate, and, the, league, deferred, to, the, conference, but, the, warring, sides, ignored, the, conference, eventually, without, going, through, article, 16, an, arms, embargo, was, enacted, by, several, members, of, the, league, plus, non, league, members, the, united, states, and, brazil, but, several, neighboring, states, ignored, the, embargo, rendering, it, ineffective, in, november, 1934, the, league, demanded, that, both, sides, withdraw, and, undergo, arbitration, bolivia, accepted, but, paraguay, by, then, had, taken, control, of, all, of, the, disputed, area, paraguay, rejected, arbitration, and, quit, the, league, in, october, 1935, italian, dictator, benito, mussolini, sent, 400, 000, troops, to, invade, abyssinia, ethiopia, marshal, pietro, badoglio, led, the, campaign, from, november, 1935, ordering, bombing, the, use, of, chemical, weapons, such, as, mustard, gas, and, the, poisoning, of, water, supplies, against, targets, which, included, undefended, villages, and, medical, facilities, the, modern, italian, army, defeated, the, poorly, armed, abyssinians, and, captured, addis, ababa, in, may, 1936, forcing, emperor, of, ethiopia, haile, selassie, to, flee, to, exile, in, england, the, league, of, nations, condemned, italy, s, aggression, and, imposed, economic, sanctions, in, november, 1935, but, the, sanctions, were, largely, ineffective, since, they, did, not, ban, the, sale, of, oil, or, close, the, suez, canal, controlled, by, britain, as, stanley, baldwin, the, british, prime, minister, later, observed, this, was, ultimately, because, no, one, had, the, military, forces, on, hand, to, withstand, an, italian, attack, in, october, 1935, the, us, president, franklin, d, roosevelt, invoked, the, recently, passed, neutrality, acts, and, placed, an, embargo, on, arms, and, munitions, to, both, sides, but, extended, a, further, moral, embargo, to, the, belligerent, italians, including, other, trade, items, on, 5, october, and, later, on, 29, february, 1936, the, united, states, endeavoured, with, limited, success, to, limit, its, exports, of, oil, and, other, materials, to, normal, peacetime, levels, the, league, sanctions, were, lifted, on, 4, july, 1936, but, by, that, point, italy, had, already, gained, control, of, the, urban, areas, of, abyssinia, the, hoare, laval, pact, of, december, 1935, was, an, attempt, by, the, british, foreign, secretary, samuel, hoare, and, the, french, prime, minister, pierre, laval, to, end, the, conflict, in, abyssinia, by, proposing, to, partition, the, country, into, an, italian, sector, and, an, abyssinian, sector, mussolini, was, prepared, to, agree, to, the, pact, but, news, of, the, deal, leaked, out, both, the, british, and, french, public, vehemently, protested, against, it, describing, it, as, a, sell, out, of, abyssinia, hoare, and, laval, were, forced, to, resign, and, the, british, and, french, governments, dissociated, themselves, from, the, two, men, in, june, 1936, although, there, was, no, precedent, for, a, head, of, state, addressing, the, assembly, of, the, league, of, nations, in, person, haile, selassie, spoke, to, the, assembly, appealing, for, its, help, in, protecting, his, country, the, abyssinian, crisis, showed, how, the, league, could, be, influenced, by, the, self, interest, of, its, members, one, of, the, reasons, why, the, sanctions, were, not, very, harsh, was, that, both, britain, and, france, feared, the, prospect, of, driving, mussolini, and, adolf, hitler, into, an, alliance, on, 17, july, 1936, the, spanish, army, launched, a, coup, d, tat, leading, to, a, prolonged, armed, conflict, between, spanish, republicans, the, elected, leftist, national, government, and, the, nationalists, conservative, anti, communist, rebels, who, included, most, officers, of, the, spanish, army, julio, lvarez, del, vayo, the, spanish, minister, of, foreign, affairs, appealed, to, the, league, in, september, 1936, for, arms, to, defend, spain, s, territorial, integrity, and, political, independence, the, league, members, would, not, intervene, in, the, spanish, civil, war, nor, prevent, foreign, intervention, in, the, conflict, adolf, hitler, and, mussolini, aided, general, francisco, franco, s, nationalists, while, the, soviet, union, helped, the, spanish, republic, in, february, 1937, the, league, did, ban, foreign, volunteers, but, this, was, in, practice, a, symbolic, move, the, result, was, a, nationalist, victory, in, 1939, and, confirmation, to, all, observers, that, the, league, was, ineffective, in, dealing, with, a, major, issue, following, a, long, record, of, instigating, localised, conflicts, throughout, the, 1930s, japan, began, a, full, scale, invasion, of, china, on, 7, july, 1937, on, 12, september, the, chinese, representative, wellington, koo, appealed, to, the, league, for, international, intervention, western, countries, were, sympathetic, to, the, chinese, in, their, struggle, particularly, in, their, stubborn, defence, of, shanghai, a, city, with, a, substantial, number, of, foreigners, the, league, was, unable, to, provide, any, practical, measures, on, 4, october, it, turned, the, case, over, to, the, nine, power, treaty, conference, the, nazi, soviet, pact, of, 23, august, 1939, contained, secret, protocols, outlining, spheres, of, interest, finland, and, the, baltic, states, as, well, as, eastern, poland, fell, into, the, soviet, sphere, after, invading, poland, on, 17, september, 1939, on, 30, november, the, soviets, invaded, finland, then, the, league, of, nations, for, the, first, time, expelled, a, member, who, had, violated, the, covenant, the, league, action, of, 14, december, 1939, stung, because, the, soviet, union, became, the, only, league, member, ever, to, suffer, such, an, indignity, article, 8, of, the, covenant, gave, the, league, the, task, of, reducing, armaments, to, the, lowest, point, consistent, with, national, safety, and, the, enforcement, by, common, action, of, international, obligations, haakon, ikonomou, argues, that, the, disarmament, section, was, a, major, failure, it, was, distrusted, by, the, great, powers, and, given, little, autonomy, by, the, secretariat, its, mediocre, staffers, generated, information, that, was, unreliable, and, caused, unrealistic, expectations, in, the, general, public, the, league, scored, some, successes, including, the, 1925, conference, for, the, supervision, of, the, international, trade, in, arms, and, ammunition, and, in, implements, of, war, it, started, to, collect, international, arms, data, most, important, was, the, passage, in, 1925, of, the, geneva, protocol, banning, poison, gas, in, war, it, reflected, strong, worldwide, public, opinion, although, the, united, states, did, not, ratify, it, until, 1975, the, league, had, numerous, failures, and, shortfalls, in, 1921, it, set, up, the, temporary, mixed, commission, on, armaments, to, explore, possibilities, for, disarmament, it, was, made, up, not, of, government, representatives, but, of, famous, individuals, they, rarely, agreed, proposals, ranged, from, abolishing, chemical, warfare, and, strategic, bombing, to, the, limitation, of, more, conventional, weapons, such, as, tanks, the, 1923, draft, treaty, of, mutual, assistance, was, an, unsuccessful, proposal, made, by, the, league, of, nations, to, address, the, issue, of, disarmament, and, security, in, europe, after, world, war, i, it, was, rejected, by, the, british, government, in, 1924, and, was, never, adopted, the, draft, treaty, was, an, early, attempt, by, the, league, to, create, a, system, of, collective, security, and, disarmament, leading, the, league, to, pursue, alternative, approaches, that, also, ultimately, failed, to, gain, traction, a, draft, treaty, was, assembled, in, 1923, that, made, aggressive, war, illegal, and, bound, the, member, states, to, defend, victims, of, aggression, by, force, since, the, onus, of, responsibility, would, in, practice, be, on, the, great, powers, of, the, league, it, was, vetoed, by, great, britain, who, feared, that, this, pledge, would, strain, its, own, commitment, to, police, its, british, empire, the, geneva, protocol, for, the, pacific, settlement, of, international, disputes, was, a, proposal, by, british, prime, minister, ramsay, macdonald, and, his, french, counterpart, douard, herriot, it, set, up, compulsory, arbitration, of, disputes, and, created, a, method, to, determine, the, aggressor, in, international, conflicts, all, legal, disputes, between, nations, would, be, submitted, to, the, world, court, it, called, for, a, disarmament, conference, in, 1925, any, government, that, refused, to, comply, in, a, dispute, would, be, named, an, aggressor, any, victim, of, aggression, was, to, receive, immediate, assistance, from, league, members, british, conservatives, condemned, the, proposal, for, fear, that, it, would, lead, to, conflict, with, the, united, states, which, also, opposed, the, proposal, the, british, dominions, strongly, opposed, it, the, conservatives, came, to, power, in, britain, and, in, march, 1925, the, proposal, was, shelved, and, never, reintroduced, the, allied, powers, were, also, under, obligation, by, the, treaty, of, versailles, to, attempt, to, disarm, and, the, armament, restrictions, imposed, on, the, defeated, countries, had, been, described, as, the, first, step, toward, worldwide, disarmament, the, league, covenant, assigned, the, league, the, task, of, creating, a, disarmament, plan, for, each, state, but, the, council, devolved, this, responsibility, to, a, special, commission, set, up, in, 1926, to, prepare, for, the, 1932, 1934, world, disarmament, conference, members, of, the, league, held, different, views, towards, the, issue, the, french, were, reluctant, to, reduce, their, armaments, without, a, guarantee, of, military, help, if, they, were, attacked, poland, and, czechoslovakia, felt, vulnerable, to, attack, from, the, west, and, wanted, the, league, s, response, to, aggression, against, its, members, to, be, strengthened, before, they, disarmed, without, this, guarantee, they, would, not, reduce, armaments, because, they, felt, the, risk, of, attack, from, germany, was, too, great, fear, of, attack, increased, as, germany, regained, its, strength, after, the, first, world, war, especially, after, adolf, hitler, gained, power, and, became, german, chancellor, in, 1933, in, particular, germany, s, attempts, to, overturn, the, treaty, of, versailles, and, the, reconstruction, of, the, german, military, made, france, increasingly, unwilling, to, disarm, the, world, disarmament, conference, was, convened, by, the, league, of, nations, in, geneva, in, 1932, with, representatives, from, 60, states, it, was, a, failure, a, one, year, moratorium, on, the, expansion, of, armaments, later, extended, by, a, few, months, was, proposed, at, the, start, of, the, conference, the, disarmament, commission, obtained, initial, agreement, from, france, italy, spain, japan, and, britain, to, limit, the, size, of, their, navies, but, no, final, agreement, was, reached, ultimately, the, commission, failed, to, halt, the, military, build, up, by, germany, italy, spain, and, japan, during, the, 1930s, the, league, was, mostly, silent, in, the, face, of, major, events, leading, to, the, second, world, war, such, as, hitler, s, remilitarisation, of, the, rhineland, occupation, of, the, sudetenland, and, anschluss, of, austria, which, had, been, forbidden, by, the, treaty, of, versailles, in, fact, league, members, themselves, re, armed, in, 1933, japan, simply, withdrew, from, the, league, rather, than, submit, to, its, judgement, as, did, germany, the, same, year, using, the, failure, of, the, world, disarmament, conference, to, agree, to, arms, parity, between, france, and, germany, as, a, pretext, italy, in, 1937, and, spain, in, 1939, the, final, significant, act, of, the, league, was, to, expel, the, soviet, union, in, december, 1939, after, it, invaded, finland, the, onset, of, the, second, world, war, demonstrated, that, the, league, had, failed, in, its, primary, purpose, the, prevention, of, another, world, war, there, were, a, variety, of, reasons, for, this, failure, many, connected, to, general, weaknesses, within, the, organisation, additionally, the, power, of, the, league, was, limited, by, the, united, states, refusal, to, join, the, origins, of, the, league, as, an, organisation, created, by, the, allied, powers, as, part, of, the, peace, settlement, to, end, the, first, world, war, led, to, it, being, viewed, as, a, league, of, victors, the, league, s, neutrality, tended, to, manifest, itself, as, indecision, it, required, a, unanimous, vote, of, nine, later, fifteen, council, members, to, enact, a, resolution, hence, conclusive, and, effective, action, was, difficult, if, not, impossible, it, was, also, slow, in, coming, to, its, decisions, as, certain, ones, required, the, unanimous, consent, of, the, entire, assembly, this, problem, mainly, stemmed, from, the, fact, that, the, primary, members, of, the, league, of, nations, were, not, willing, to, accept, the, possibility, of, their, fate, being, decided, by, other, countries, and, by, enforcing, unanimous, voting, had, effectively, given, themselves, veto, power, representation, at, the, league, was, often, a, problem, though, it, was, intended, to, encompass, all, nations, many, never, joined, or, their, period, of, membership, was, short, the, most, conspicuous, absentee, was, the, united, states, president, woodrow, wilson, had, been, a, driving, force, behind, the, league, s, formation, and, strongly, influenced, the, form, it, took, but, the, us, senate, voted, not, to, join, on, 19, november, 1919, ruth, henig, has, suggested, that, had, the, united, states, become, a, member, it, would, have, also, provided, support, to, france, and, britain, possibly, making, france, feel, more, secure, and, so, encouraging, france, and, britain, to, co, operate, more, fully, regarding, germany, thus, making, the, rise, to, power, of, the, nazi, party, less, likely, conversely, henig, acknowledges, that, if, the, us, had, been, a, member, its, reluctance, to, engage, in, war, with, european, states, or, to, enact, economic, sanctions, might, have, hampered, the, ability, of, the, league, to, deal, with, international, incidents, the, structure, of, the, us, federal, government, might, also, have, made, its, membership, problematic, as, its, representatives, at, the, league, would, only, be, able, to, answer, on, behalf, of, the, executive, branch, certain, league, decisions, such, as, to, go, to, war, would, always, require, prior, approval, of, the, legislative, branch, regardless, of, the, outcome, of, any, floor, vote, even, in, january, 1920, when, the, league, was, born, germany, was, not, permitted, to, join, because, it, was, seen, as, having, been, the, aggressor, in, the, first, world, war, soviet, russia, was, also, initially, excluded, because, communist, regimes, were, not, welcomed, and, membership, would, have, been, initially, dubious, due, to, the, ongoing, russian, civil, war, in, which, both, sides, claimed, to, be, the, legitimate, government, of, the, country, the, league, was, further, weakened, when, major, powers, left, in, the, 1930s, japan, began, as, a, permanent, member, of, the, council, since, the, country, was, an, allied, power, in, the, first, world, war, but, withdrew, in, 1933, after, the, league, voiced, opposition, to, its, occupation, of, manchuria, italy, also, began, as, a, permanent, member, of, the, council, however, the, league, staunchly, opposed, italy, s, invasion, of, ethiopia, in, 1934, when, the, war, ended, in, an, italian, conquest, the, league, refused, to, recognize, italian, sovereignty, over, ethiopia, prompting, the, italian, fascist, government, to, withdraw, from, the, organization, altogether, in, 1937, though, neutral, during, world, war, i, spain, then, still, a, kingdom, also, began, as, a, permanent, member, of, the, council, but, withdrew, in, 1939, after, the, spanish, civil, war, ended, in, a, victory, for, the, nationalists, though, world, opinion, was, much, more, divided, over, the, spanish, civil, war, than, the, conflicts, involving, japan, and, italy, the, general, perception, leaned, in, favor, of, the, republican, cause, the, league, had, accepted, germany, also, as, a, permanent, member, of, the, council, in, 1926, deeming, it, to, have, become, a, peace, loving, country, under, the, weimar, republic, after, the, nazis, came, to, power, in, 1933, adolf, hitler, withdrew, germany, almost, immediately, another, important, weakness, grew, from, the, contradiction, between, the, idea, of, collective, security, that, formed, the, basis, of, the, league, and, international, relations, between, individual, states, the, league, s, collective, security, system, required, nations, to, act, if, necessary, against, states, they, considered, friendly, and, in, a, way, that, might, endanger, their, national, interests, to, support, states, for, which, they, had, no, normal, affinity, this, weakness, was, exposed, during, the, abyssinia, crisis, when, britain, and, france, had, to, balance, maintaining, the, security, they, had, attempted, to, create, for, themselves, in, europe, to, defend, against, the, enemies, of, internal, order, in, which, italy, s, support, played, a, pivotal, role, with, their, obligations, to, abyssinia, as, a, member, of, the, league, on, 23, june, 1936, in, the, wake, of, the, collapse, of, league, efforts, to, restrain, italy, s, war, against, abyssinia, the, british, prime, minister, stanley, baldwin, told, the, house, of, commons, that, collective, security, had, failed, ultimately, because, of, the, reluctance, of, nearly, all, the, nations, in, europe, to, proceed, to, what, i, might, call, military, sanctions, the, real, reason, or, the, main, reason, was, that, we, discovered, in, the, process, of, weeks, that, there, was, no, country, except, the, aggressor, country, which, was, ready, for, war, f, collective, action, is, to, be, a, reality, and, not, merely, a, thing, to, be, talked, about, it, means, not, only, that, every, country, is, to, be, ready, for, war, but, must, be, ready, to, go, to, war, at, once, that, is, a, terrible, thing, but, it, is, an, essential, part, of, collective, security, ultimately, britain, and, france, both, abandoned, the, concept, of, collective, security, in, favour, of, appeasement, in, the, face, of, growing, german, militarism, under, hitler, in, this, context, the, league, of, nations, was, also, the, institution, where, the, first, international, debate, on, terrorism, took, place, following, the, 1934, assassination, of, king, alexander, i, of, yugoslavia, in, marseille, france, this, debate, established, precedents, regarding, global, surveillance, in, the, form, of, routine, international, sharing, of, surveillance, data, the, punishment, of, terrorists, as, an, international, rather, than, national, matter, and, the, right, of, a, nation, to, conduct, military, attacks, within, another, nation, as, a, response, to, international, terrorism, many, of, these, concepts, are, detectable, in, the, discourse, of, terrorism, among, states, after, 9, 11, american, diplomatic, historian, samuel, flagg, bemis, originally, supported, the, league, but, after, two, decades, changed, his, mind, the, league, of, nations, has, been, a, disappointing, failure, it, has, been, a, failure, not, because, the, united, states, did, not, join, it, but, because, the, great, powers, have, been, unwilling, to, apply, sanctions, except, where, it, suited, their, individual, national, interests, to, do, so, and, because, democracy, on, which, the, original, concepts, of, the, league, rested, for, support, has, collapsed, over, half, the, world, the, league, of, nations, lacked, an, armed, force, of, its, own, and, depended, on, the, great, powers, to, enforce, its, resolutions, which, they, were, very, unwilling, to, do, its, two, most, important, members, britain, and, france, were, reluctant, to, use, sanctions, and, even, more, reluctant, to, resort, to, military, action, on, behalf, of, the, league, immediately, after, the, first, world, war, pacifism, became, a, strong, force, among, both, the, people, and, governments, of, the, two, countries, the, british, conservatives, were, especially, tepid, to, the, league, and, preferred, when, in, government, to, negotiate, treaties, without, the, involvement, of, that, organisation, moreover, the, league, s, advocacy, of, disarmament, for, britain, france, and, its, other, members, while, at, the, same, time, advocating, collective, security, meant, that, the, league, was, depriving, itself, of, the, only, forceful, means, by, which, it, could, uphold, its, authority, david, goodman, argues, that, the, 1936, league, of, nations, convention, on, the, use, of, broadcasting, in, the, cause, of, peace, tried, to, create, the, standards, for, a, liberal, international, public, sphere, the, convention, encouraged, friendly, radio, broadcasts, to, other, nations, it, called, for, league, prohibitions, on, international, broadcasts, containing, hostile, speech, and, false, claims, it, tried, to, draw, the, line, between, liberal, and, illiberal, policies, in, communications, and, emphasized, the, dangers, of, nationalist, chauvinism, with, nazi, germany, and, soviet, russia, active, on, the, radio, its, liberal, goals, were, ignored, while, liberals, warned, that, the, code, represented, restraints, on, free, speech, as, the, situation, in, europe, escalated, into, war, the, assembly, transferred, enough, power, to, the, secretary, general, on, 30, september, 1938, and, 14, december, 1939, to, allow, the, league, to, continue, to, exist, legally, and, carry, on, reduced, operations, the, headquarters, of, the, league, the, palace, of, nations, remained, unoccupied, for, nearly, six, years, until, the, second, world, war, ended, at, the, 1943, tehran, conference, the, allied, powers, agreed, to, create, a, new, body, to, replace, the, league, the, united, nations, many, league, bodies, such, as, the, international, labour, organization, continued, to, function, and, eventually, became, affiliated, with, the, un, the, designers, of, the, structures, of, the, united, nations, intended, to, make, it, more, effective, than, the, league, the, final, session, of, the, league, of, nations, concluded, on, 18, april, 1946, in, geneva, delegates, from, 34, nations, attended, the, assembly, this, session, concerned, itself, with, liquidating, the, league, it, transferred, assets, worth, approximately, 22, 000, 000, u, s, in, 1946, including, the, palace, of, nations, and, the, league, s, archives, to, the, un, returned, reserve, funds, to, the, nations, that, had, supplied, them, and, settled, the, debts, of, the, league, robert, cecil, addressing, the, final, session, said, let, us, boldly, state, that, aggression, wherever, it, occurs, and, however, it, may, be, defended, is, an, international, crime, that, it, is, the, duty, of, every, peace, loving, state, to, resent, it, and, employ, whatever, force, is, necessary, to, crush, it, that, the, machinery, of, the, charter, no, less, than, the, machinery, of, the, covenant, is, sufficient, for, this, purpose, if, properly, used, and, that, every, well, disposed, citizen, of, every, state, should, be, ready, to, undergo, any, sacrifice, in, order, to, maintain, peace, i, venture, to, impress, upon, my, hearers, that, the, great, work, of, peace, is, resting, not, only, on, the, narrow, interests, of, our, own, nations, but, even, more, on, those, great, principles, of, right, and, wrong, which, nations, like, individuals, depend, the, league, is, dead, long, live, the, united, nations, the, assembly, passed, a, resolution, that, with, effect, from, the, day, following, the, close, of, the, present, session, of, the, assembly, the, league, of, nations, shall, cease, to, exist, except, for, the, sole, purpose, of, the, liquidation, of, its, affairs, as, provided, in, the, present, resolution, a, board, of, liquidation, consisting, of, nine, persons, from, different, countries, spent, the, next, 15, months, overseeing, the, transfer, of, the, league, s, assets, and, functions, to, the, united, nations, or, specialised, bodies, finally, dissolving, itself, on, 31, july, 1947, the, archive, of, the, league, of, nations, was, transferred, to, the, united, nations, office, at, geneva, and, is, now, an, entry, in, the, unesco, memory, of, the, world, register, in, the, assembly, s, last, session, in, 1946, philip, noel, baker, representing, the, united, kingdom, remarked, that, failure, to, act, as, soon, as, a, great, power, had, invaded, another, state, had, ultimately, doomed, the, league, we, know, the, world, war, began, in, manchuria, 15, years, ago, manchuria, abyssinia, munich, have, killed, another, great, illusion, the, belief, that, appeasement, seeking, the, national, interest, at, the, expense, of, others, individual, action, secret, bargains, could, bring, us, peace, in, the, past, few, decades, by, research, using, the, league, archives, at, geneva, historians, have, reviewed, the, legacy, of, the, league, of, nations, as, the, united, nations, has, faced, similar, troubles, to, those, of, the, interwar, period, current, consensus, views, that, even, though, the, league, failed, to, achieve, its, ultimate, goal, of, world, peace, it, did, manage, to, build, new, roads, towards, expanding, the, rule, of, law, across, the, globe, strengthened, the, concept, of, collective, security, giving, a, voice, to, smaller, nations, helped, to, raise, awareness, to, problems, like, epidemics, slavery, child, labour, colonial, tyranny, refugee, crises, and, general, working, conditions, through, its, numerous, commissions, and, committees, and, paved, the, way, for, new, forms, of, statehood, as, the, mandate, system, put, the, colonial, powers, under, international, observation, professor, david, kennedy, portrays, the, league, as, a, unique, moment, when, international, affairs, were, institutionalised, as, opposed, to, the, pre, first, world, war, methods, of, law, and, politics, the, principal, allies, in, the, second, world, war, the, uk, the, ussr, france, the,
