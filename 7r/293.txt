in, linguistics, syntax, s, n, t, k, s, sin, taks, is, the, study, of, how, words, and, morphemes, combine, to, form, larger, units, such, as, phrases, and, sentences, central, concerns, of, syntax, include, word, order, grammatical, relations, hierarchical, sentence, structure, constituency, agreement, the, nature, of, crosslinguistic, variation, and, the, relationship, between, form, and, meaning, semantics, there, are, numerous, approaches, to, syntax, that, differ, in, their, central, assumptions, and, goals, the, word, syntax, comes, from, ancient, greek, roots, coordination, which, consists, of, syn, together, and, t, xis, ordering, the, field, of, syntax, contains, a, number, of, various, topics, that, a, syntactic, theory, is, often, designed, to, handle, the, relation, between, the, topics, is, treated, differently, in, different, theories, and, some, of, them, may, not, be, considered, to, be, distinct, but, instead, to, be, derived, from, one, another, i, e, word, order, can, be, seen, as, the, result, of, movement, rules, derived, from, grammatical, relations, one, basic, description, of, a, language, s, syntax, is, the, sequence, in, which, the, subject, s, verb, v, and, object, o, usually, appear, in, sentences, over, 85, of, languages, usually, place, the, subject, first, either, in, the, sequence, svo, or, the, sequence, sov, the, other, possible, sequences, are, vso, vos, ovs, and, osv, the, last, three, of, which, are, rare, in, most, generative, theories, of, syntax, the, surface, differences, arise, from, a, more, complex, clausal, phrase, structure, and, each, order, may, be, compatible, with, multiple, derivations, however, word, order, can, also, reflect, the, semantics, or, function, of, the, ordered, elements, another, description, of, a, language, considers, the, set, of, possible, grammatical, relations, in, a, language, or, in, general, and, how, they, behave, in, relation, to, one, another, in, the, morphosyntactic, alignment, of, the, language, the, description, of, grammatical, relations, can, also, reflect, transitivity, passivization, and, head, dependent, marking, or, other, agreement, languages, have, different, criteria, for, grammatical, relations, for, example, subjecthood, criteria, may, have, implications, for, how, the, subject, is, referred, to, from, a, relative, clause, or, coreferential, with, an, element, in, an, infinite, clause, constituency, is, the, feature, of, being, a, constituent, and, how, words, can, work, together, to, form, a, constituent, or, phrase, constituents, are, often, moved, as, units, and, the, constituent, can, be, the, domain, of, agreement, some, languages, allow, discontinuous, phrases, in, which, words, belonging, to, the, same, constituent, are, not, immediately, adjacent, but, are, broken, up, by, other, constituents, constituents, may, be, recursive, as, they, may, consist, of, other, constituents, potentially, of, the, same, type, the, a, dhy, y, of, p, ini, from, c, 4th, century, bc, in, ancient, india, is, often, cited, as, an, example, of, a, premodern, work, that, approaches, the, sophistication, of, a, modern, syntactic, theory, since, works, on, grammar, had, been, written, long, before, modern, syntax, came, about, in, the, west, the, school, of, thought, that, came, to, be, known, as, traditional, grammar, began, with, the, work, of, dionysius, thrax, for, centuries, a, framework, known, as, grammaire, g, n, rale, first, expounded, in, 1660, by, antoine, arnauld, and, claude, lancelot, in, a, book, of, the, same, title, dominated, work, in, syntax, as, its, basic, premise, the, assumption, that, language, is, a, direct, reflection, of, thought, processes, and, so, there, is, a, single, most, natural, way, to, express, a, thought, however, in, the, 19th, century, with, the, development, of, historical, comparative, linguistics, linguists, began, to, realize, the, sheer, diversity, of, human, language, and, to, question, fundamental, assumptions, about, the, relationship, between, language, and, logic, it, became, apparent, that, there, was, no, such, thing, as, the, most, natural, way, to, express, a, thought, and, so, logic, could, no, longer, be, relied, upon, as, a, basis, for, studying, the, structure, of, language, the, port, royal, grammar, modeled, the, study, of, syntax, upon, that, of, logic, indeed, large, parts, of, port, royal, logic, were, copied, or, adapted, from, the, grammaire, g, n, rale, syntactic, categories, were, identified, with, logical, ones, and, all, sentences, were, analyzed, in, terms, of, subject, copula, predicate, initially, that, view, was, adopted, even, by, the, early, comparative, linguists, such, as, franz, bopp, the, central, role, of, syntax, within, theoretical, linguistics, became, clear, only, in, the, 20th, century, which, could, reasonably, be, called, the, century, of, syntactic, theory, as, far, as, linguistics, is, concerned, for, a, detailed, and, critical, survey, of, the, history, of, syntax, in, the, last, two, centuries, see, the, monumental, work, by, giorgio, graffi, 2001, there, are, a, number, of, theoretical, approaches, to, the, discipline, of, syntax, one, school, of, thought, founded, in, the, works, of, derek, bickerton, sees, syntax, as, a, branch, of, biology, since, it, conceives, of, syntax, as, the, study, of, linguistic, knowledge, as, embodied, in, the, human, mind, other, linguists, e, g, gerald, gazdar, take, a, more, platonistic, view, since, they, regard, syntax, to, be, the, study, of, an, abstract, formal, system, yet, others, e, g, joseph, greenberg, consider, syntax, a, taxonomical, device, to, reach, broad, generalizations, across, languages, syntacticians, have, attempted, to, explain, the, causes, of, word, order, variation, within, individual, languages, and, cross, linguistically, much, of, such, work, has, been, done, within, the, framework, of, generative, grammar, which, holds, that, syntax, depends, on, a, genetic, endowment, common, to, the, human, species, in, that, framework, and, in, others, linguistic, typology, and, universals, have, been, primary, explicanda, alternative, explanations, such, as, those, by, functional, linguists, have, been, sought, in, language, processing, it, is, suggested, that, the, brain, finds, it, easier, to, parse, syntactic, patterns, that, are, either, right, or, left, branching, but, not, mixed, the, most, widely, held, approach, is, the, performance, grammar, correspondence, hypothesis, by, john, a, hawkins, who, suggests, that, language, is, a, non, innate, adaptation, to, innate, cognitive, mechanisms, cross, linguistic, tendencies, are, considered, as, being, based, on, language, users, preference, for, grammars, that, are, organized, efficiently, and, on, their, avoidance, of, word, orderings, that, cause, processing, difficulty, some, languages, however, exhibit, regular, inefficient, patterning, such, as, the, vo, languages, chinese, with, the, adpositional, phrase, before, the, verb, and, finnish, which, has, postpositions, but, there, are, few, other, profoundly, exceptional, languages, more, recently, it, is, suggested, that, the, left, versus, right, branching, patterns, are, cross, linguistically, related, only, to, the, place, of, role, marking, connectives, adpositions, and, subordinators, which, links, the, phenomena, with, the, semantic, mapping, of, sentences, dependency, grammar, is, an, approach, to, sentence, structure, in, which, syntactic, units, are, arranged, according, to, the, dependency, relation, as, opposed, to, the, constituency, relation, of, phrase, structure, grammars, dependencies, are, directed, links, between, words, the, finite, verb, is, seen, as, the, root, of, all, clause, structure, and, all, the, other, words, in, the, clause, are, either, directly, or, indirectly, dependent, on, this, root, i, e, the, verb, some, prominent, dependency, based, theories, of, syntax, are, the, following, lucien, tesni, re, 1893, 1954, is, widely, seen, as, the, father, of, modern, dependency, based, theories, of, syntax, and, grammar, he, argued, strongly, against, the, binary, division, of, the, clause, into, subject, and, predicate, that, is, associated, with, the, grammars, of, his, day, s, np, vp, and, remains, at, the, core, of, most, phrase, structure, grammars, in, the, place, of, that, division, he, positioned, the, verb, as, the, root, of, all, clause, structure, categorial, grammar, is, an, approach, in, which, constituents, combine, as, function, and, argument, according, to, combinatory, possibilities, specified, in, their, syntactic, categories, for, example, other, approaches, might, posit, a, rule, that, combines, a, noun, phrase, np, and, a, verb, phrase, vp, but, cg, would, posit, a, syntactic, category, np, and, another, np, s, read, as, a, category, that, searches, to, the, left, indicated, by, for, an, np, the, element, on, the, left, and, outputs, a, sentence, the, element, on, the, right, thus, the, syntactic, category, for, an, intransitive, verb, is, a, complex, formula, representing, the, fact, that, the, verb, acts, as, a, function, word, requiring, an, np, as, an, input, and, produces, a, sentence, level, structure, as, an, output, the, complex, category, is, notated, as, np, s, instead, of, v, the, category, of, transitive, verb, is, defined, as, an, element, that, requires, two, nps, its, subject, and, its, direct, object, to, form, a, sentence, that, is, notated, as, np, np, s, which, means, a, category, that, searches, to, the, right, indicated, by, for, an, np, the, object, and, generates, a, function, equivalent, to, the, vp, which, is, np, s, which, in, turn, represents, a, function, that, searches, to, the, left, for, an, np, and, produces, a, sentence, tree, adjoining, grammar, is, a, categorial, grammar, that, adds, in, partial, tree, structures, to, the, categories, theoretical, approaches, to, syntax, that, are, based, upon, probability, theory, are, known, as, stochastic, grammars, one, common, implementation, of, such, an, approach, makes, use, of, a, neural, network, or, connectionism, functionalist, models, of, grammar, study, the, form, function, interaction, by, performing, a, structural, and, a, functional, analysis, generative, syntax, is, the, study, of, syntax, within, the, overarching, framework, of, generative, grammar, generative, theories, of, syntax, typically, propose, analyses, of, grammatical, patterns, using, formal, tools, such, as, phrase, structure, grammars, augmented, with, additional, operations, such, as, syntactic, movement, their, goal, in, analyzing, a, particular, language, is, to, specify, rules, which, generate, all, and, only, the, expressions, which, are, well, formed, in, that, language, in, doing, so, they, seek, to, identify, innate, domain, specific, principles, of, linguistic, cognition, in, line, with, the, wider, goals, of, the, generative, enterprise, generative, syntax, is, among, the, approaches, that, adopt, the, principle, of, the, autonomy, of, syntax, by, assuming, that, meaning, and, communicative, intent, is, determined, by, the, syntax, rather, than, the, other, way, around, generative, syntax, was, proposed, in, the, late, 1950s, by, noam, chomsky, building, on, earlier, work, by, zellig, harris, louis, hjelmslev, and, others, since, then, numerous, theories, have, been, proposed, under, its, umbrella, other, theories, that, find, their, origin, in, the, generative, paradigm, are, the, cognitive, linguistics, framework, stems, from, generative, grammar, but, adheres, to, evolutionary, rather, than, chomskyan, linguistics, cognitive, models, often, recognise, the, generative, assumption, that, the, object, belongs, to, the, verb, phrase, cognitive, frameworks, include, the, following
