bridges, including, the, rialto, and, the, pont, de, neuilly, and, were, subsequently, rendered, more, generic, the, final, designs, still, bear, very, close, similarities, to, their, specific,

cheques, have, not, been, standardised, so, these, are, still, domestic, based, the, ecb, has, also, set, up, a, clearing, system, target, for, large, euro, transactions, the, euro, was, established, by, the, provisions, in, the, 1992, maastricht, treaty, to, participate, in, the, currency, member, states, are, meant, to, meet, strict, criteria, such, as, a, budget, deficit, of, less, than, 3, of, their, gdp, a, debt, ratio, of, less, than, 60, of, gdp, both, of, which, were, ultimately, widely, flouted, after, introduction, low, inflation, and, interest, rates, close, to, the, eu, average, in, the, maastricht, treaty, the, united, kingdom, and, denmark, were, granted, exemptions, per, their, request, from, moving, to, the, stage, of, monetary, union, which, resulted, in, the, introduction, of, the, euro, see, also, united, kingdom, and, the, euro, the, name, euro, was, officially, adopted, in, madrid, on, 16, december, 1995, belgian, esperantist, germain, pirlot, a, former, teacher, of, french, and, history, is, credited, with, naming, the, new, currency, by, sending, a, letter, to, then, president, of, the, european, commission, jacques, santer, suggesting, the, name, euro, on, 4, august, 1995, due, to, differences, in, national, conventions, for, rounding, and, significant, digits, all, conversion, between, the, national, currencies, had, to, be, carried, out, using, the, process, of, triangulation, via, the, euro, the, definitive, values, of, one, euro, in, terms, of, the, exchange, rates, at, which, the, currency, entered, the, euro, are, shown, in, the, table, the, rates, were, determined, by, the, council, of, the, european, union, based, on, a, recommendation, from, the, european, commission, based, on, the, market, rates, on, 31, december, 1998, they, were, set, so, that, one, european, currency, unit, ecu, would, equal, one, euro, the, european, currency, unit, was, an, accounting, unit, used, by, the, eu, based, on, the, currencies, of, the, member, states, it, was, not, a, currency, in, its, own, right, they, could, not, be, set, earlier, because, the, ecu, depended, on, the, closing, exchange, rate, of, the, non, euro, currencies, principally, pound, sterling, that, day, the, procedure, used, to, fix, the, conversion, rate, between, the, greek, drachma, and, the, euro, was, different, since, the, euro, by, then, was, already, two, years, old, while, the, conversion, rates, for, the, initial, eleven, currencies, were, determined, only, hours, before, the, euro, was, introduced, the, conversion, rate, for, the, greek, drachma, was, fixed, several, months, beforehand, the, currency, was, introduced, in, non, physical, form, traveller, s, cheques, electronic, transfers, banking, etc, at, midnight, on, 1, january, 1999, when, the, national, currencies, of, participating, countries, the, eurozone, ceased, to, exist, independently, their, exchange, rates, were, locked, at, fixed, rates, against, each, other, the, euro, thus, became, the, successor, to, the, european, currency, unit, ecu, the, notes, and, coins, for, the, old, currencies, however, continued, to, be, used, as, legal, tender, until, new, euro, notes, and, coins, were, introduced, on, 1, january, 2002, the, changeover, period, during, which, the, former, currencies, notes, and, coins, were, exchanged, for, those, of, the, euro, lasted, about, two, months, until, 28, february, 2002, the, official, date, on, which, the, national, currencies, ceased, to, be, legal, tender, varied, from, member, state, to, member, state, the, earliest, date, was, in, germany, where, the, mark, officially, ceased, to, be, legal, tender, on, 31, december, 2001, though, the, exchange, period, lasted, for, two, months, more, even, after, the, old, currencies, ceased, to, be, legal, tender, they, continued, to, be, accepted, by, national, central, banks, for, periods, ranging, from, several, years, to, indefinitely, the, latter, for, austria, germany, ireland, estonia, and, latvia, in, banknotes, and, coins, and, for, belgium, luxembourg, slovenia, and, slovakia, in, banknotes, only, the, earliest, coins, to, become, non, convertible, were, the, portuguese, escudos, which, ceased, to, have, monetary, value, after, 31, december, 2002, although, banknotes, remained, exchangeable, until, 2022, a, special, euro, currency, sign, was, designed, after, a, public, survey, had, narrowed, ten, of, the, original, thirty, proposals, down, to, two, the, president, of, the, european, commission, at, the, time, jacques, santer, and, the, european, commissioner, with, responsibility, for, the, euro, yves, thibault, de, silguy, then, chose, the, winning, design, regarding, the, symbol, the, european, commission, stated, on, behalf, of, the, european, union, the, symbol, is, based, on, the, greek, letter, epsilon, with, the, first, letter, in, the, word, europe, and, with, 2, parallel, lines, signifying, stability, the, european, commission, also, specified, a, euro, logo, with, exact, proportions, placement, of, the, currency, sign, relative, to, the, numeric, amount, varies, from, state, to, state, but, for, texts, in, english, published, by, eu, institutions, the, symbol, or, the, iso, standard, eur, should, precede, the, amount, following, the, u, s, financial, crisis, in, 2008, fears, of, a, sovereign, debt, crisis, developed, in, 2009, among, investors, concerning, some, european, states, with, the, situation, becoming, particularly, tense, in, early, 2010, greece, was, most, acutely, affected, but, fellow, eurozone, members, cyprus, ireland, italy, portugal, and, spain, were, also, significantly, affected, all, these, countries, used, eu, funds, except, italy, which, is, a, major, donor, to, the, efsf, to, be, included, in, the, eurozone, countries, had, to, fulfil, certain, convergence, criteria, but, the, meaningfulness, of, such, criteria, was, diminished, by, the, fact, it, was, not, enforced, with, the, same, level, of, strictness, among, countries, according, to, the, economist, intelligence, unit, in, 2011, f, the, is, treated, as, a, single, entity, its, position, looks, no, worse, and, in, some, respects, rather, better, than, that, of, the, us, or, the, uk, and, the, budget, deficit, for, the, euro, area, as, a, whole, is, much, lower, and, the, euro, area, s, government, debt, gdp, ratio, of, 86, in, 2010, was, about, the, same, level, as, that, of, the, united, states, moreover, they, write, private, sector, indebtedness, across, the, euro, area, as, a, whole, is, markedly, lower, than, in, the, highly, leveraged, anglo, saxon, economies, the, authors, conclude, that, the, crisis, is, as, much, political, as, economic, and, the, result, of, the, fact, that, the, euro, area, lacks, the, support, of, institutional, paraphernalia, and, mutual, bonds, of, solidarity, of, a, state, the, crisis, continued, with, s, p, downgrading, the, credit, rating, of, nine, euro, area, countries, including, france, then, downgrading, the, entire, european, financial, stability, facility, efsf, fund, a, historical, parallel, to, 1931, when, germany, was,

in, emerging, and, developing, economies, the, possibility, of, the, euro, becoming, the, first, international, reserve, currency, has, been, debated, among, economists, former, federal, reserve, chairman, alan, greenspan, gave, his, opinion, in, september, 2007, that, it, was, absolutely, conceivable, that, the, euro, will, replace, the, us, dollar, as, reserve, currency, or, will, be, traded, as, an, equally, important, reserve, currency, in, contrast, to, greenspan, s, 2007, assessment, the, euro, s, increase, in, the, share, of, the, worldwide, currency, reserve, basket, has, slowed, considerably, since, 2007, and, since, the, beginning, of, the, worldwide, credit, crunch, related, recession, and, european, sovereign, debt, crisis, in, economics, an, optimum, currency, area, or, region, oca, or, ocr, is, a, geographical, region, in, which, it, would, maximise, economic, efficiency, to, have, the, entire, region, share, a, single, currency, there, are, two, models, both, proposed, by, robert, mundell, the, stationary, expectations, model, and, the, international, risk, sharing, model, mundell, himself, advocates, the, international, risk, sharing, model, and, thus, concludes, in, favour, of, the, euro, however, even, before, the, creation, of, the, single, currency, there, were, concerns, over, diverging, economies, before, the, late, 2000s, recession, it, was, considered, unlikely, that, a, state, would, leave, the, euro, or, the, whole, zone, would, collapse, however, the, greek, government, debt, crisis, led, to, former, british, foreign, secretary, jack, straw, claiming, the, eurozone, could, not, last, in, its, current, form, part, of, the, problem, seems, to, be, the, rules, that, were, created, when, the, euro, was, set, up, john, lanchester, writing, for, the, new, yorker, explains, it, the, guiding, principle, of, the, currency, which, opened, for, business, in, 1999, were, supposed, to, be, a, set, of, rules, to, limit, a, country, s, annual, deficit, to, three, per, cent, of, gross, domestic, product, and, the, total, accumulated, debt, to, sixty, per, cent, of, g, d, p, it, was, a, nice, idea, but, by, 2004, the, two, biggest, economies, in, the, euro, zone, germany, and, france, had, broken, the, rules, for, three, years, in, a, row, increasing, business, cycle, divergence, across, the, eurozone, over, the, last, decades, implies, a, decreasing, optimum, currency, area, the, most, obvious, benefit, of, adopting, a, single, currency, is, to, remove, the, cost, of, exchanging, currency, theoretically, allowing, businesses, and, individuals, to, consummate, previously, unprofitable, trades, for, consumers, banks, in, the, eurozone, must, charge, the, same, for, intra, member, cross, border, transactions, as, purely, domestic, transactions, for, electronic, payments, e, g, credit, cards, debit, cards, and, cash, machine, withdrawals, financial, markets, on, the, continent, are, expected, to, be, far, more, liquid, and, flexible, than, they, were, in, the, past, the, reduction, in, cross, border, transaction, costs, will, allow, larger, banking, firms, to, provide, a, wider, array, of, banking, services, that, can, compete, across, and, beyond, the, eurozone, however, although, transaction, costs, were, reduced, some, studies, have, shown, that, risk, aversion, has, increased, during, the, last, 40, years, in, the, eurozone, another, effect, of, the, common, european, currency, is, that, differences, in, prices, in, particular, in, price, levels, should, decrease, because, of, the, law, of, one, price, differences, in, prices, can, trigger, arbitrage, i, e, speculative, trade, in, a, commodity, across, borders, purely, to, exploit, the, price, differential, therefore, prices, on, commonly, traded, goods, are, likely, to, converge, causing, inflation, in, some, regions, and, deflation, in, others, during, the, transition, some, evidence, of, this, has, been, observed, in, specific, eurozone, markets, before, the, introduction, of, the, euro, some, countries, had, successfully, contained, inflation, which, was, then, seen, as, a, major, economic, problem, by, establishing, largely, independent, central, banks, one, such, bank, was, the, bundesbank, in, germany, the, european, central, bank, was, modelled, on, the, bundesbank, the, euro, has, come, under, criticism, due, to, its, regulation, lack, of, flexibility, and, rigidity, towards, sharing, member, states, on, issues, such, as, nominal, interest, rates, many, national, and, corporate, bonds, denominated, in, euro, are, significantly, more, liquid, and, have, lower, interest, rates, than, was, historically, the, case, when, denominated, in, national, currencies, while, increased, liquidity, may, lower, the, nominal, interest, rate, on, the, bond, denominating, the, bond, in, a, currency, with, low, levels, of, inflation, arguably, plays, a, much, larger, role, a, credible, commitment, to, low, levels, of, inflation, and, a, stable, debt, reduces, the, risk, that, the, value, of, the, debt, will, be, eroded, by, higher, levels, of, inflation, or, default, in, the, future, allowing, debt, to, be, issued, at, a, lower, nominal, interest, rate, there, is, also, a, cost, in, structurally, keeping, inflation, lower, than, in, the, united, states, united, kingdom, and, china, the, result, is, that, seen, from, those, countries, the, euro, has, become, expensive, making, european, products, increasingly, expensive, for, its, largest, importers, hence, export, from, the, eurozone, becomes, more, difficult, in, general, those, in, europe, who, own, large, amounts, of, euro, are, served, by, high, stability, and, low, inflation, a, monetary, union, means, states, in, that, union, lose, the, main, mechanism, of, recovery, of, their, international, competitiveness, by, weakening, depreciating, their, currency, when, wages, become, too, high, compared, to, productivity, in, the, exports, sector, then, these, exports, become, more, expensive, and, they, are, crowded, out, from, the, market, within, a, country, and, abroad, this, drives, the, fall, of, employment, and, output, in, the, exports, sector, and, fall, of, trade, and, current, account, balances, fall, of, output, and, employment, in, the, tradable, goods, sector, may, be, offset, by, the, growth, of, non, exports, sectors, especially, in, construction, and, services, increased, purchases, abroad, and, negative, current, account, balances, can, be, financed, without, a, problem, as, long, as, credit, is, cheap, the, need, to, finance, trade, deficit, weakens, currency, making, exports, automatically, more, attractive, in, a, country, and, abroad, a, state, in, a, monetary, union, cannot, use, weakening, of, currency, to, recover, its, international, competitiveness, to, achieve, this, a, state, has, to, reduce, prices, including, wages, deflation, this, could, result, in, high, unemployment, and, lower, incomes, as, it, was, during, the, european, sovereign, debt, crisis, the, euro, increased, price, transparency, and, stimulated, cross, border, trade, a, 2009, consensus, from, the, studies, of, the, introduction, of, the, euro, concluded, that, it, has, increased, trade, within, the, eurozone, by, 5, to, 10, and, a, meta, analysis, of, all, available, studies, on, the, effect, of, introduction, of, the, euro, on, increased, trade, suggests, that, the, prevalence, of, positive, estimates, is, caused, by, publication, bias, and, that, the, underlying, effect, may, be, negligible, although, a, more, recent, meta, analysis, shows, that, publication, bias, decreases, over, time, and, that, there, are, positive, trade, effects, from, the, introduction, of, the, euro, as, long, as, results, from, before, 2010, are, taken, into, account, this, may, be, because, of, the, inclusion, of, the, financial, crisis, of, 2007, 2008, and, ongoing, integration, within, the, eu, furthermore, older, studies, based, on, certain, methods, of, analysis, of, main, trends, reflecting, general, cohesion, policies, in, europe, that, started, before, and, continue, after, implementing, the, common, currency, find, no, effect, on, trade, these, results, suggest, that, other, policies, aimed, at, european, integration, might, be, the, source, of, observed, increase, in, trade, according, to, barry, eichengreen, studies, disagree, on, the, magnitude, of, the, effect, of, the, euro, on, trade, but, they, agree, that, it, did, have, an, effect, physical, investment, seems, to, have, increased, by, 5, in, the, eurozone, due, to, the, introduction, regarding, foreign, direct, investment, a, study, found, that, the, intra, eurozone, fdi, stocks, have, increased, by, about, 20, during, the, first, four, years, of, the, emu, concerning, the, effect, on, corporate, investment, there, is, evidence, that, the, introduction, of, the, euro, has, resulted, in, an, increase, in, investment, rates, and, that, it, has, made, it, easier, for, firms, to, access, financing, in, europe, the, euro, has, most, specifically, stimulated, investment, in, companies, that, come, from, countries, that, previously, had, weak, currencies, a, study, found, that, the, introduction, of, the, euro, accounts, for, 22, of, the, investment, rate, after, 1998, in, countries, that, previously, had, a, weak, currency, the, introduction, of, the, euro, has, led, to, extensive, discussion, about, its, possible, effect, on, inflation, in, the, short, term, there, was, a, widespread, impression, in, the, population, of, the, eurozone, that, the, introduction, of, the, euro, had, led, to, an, increase, in, prices, but, this, impression, was, not, confirmed, by, general, indices, of, inflation, and, other, studies, a, study, of, this, paradox, found, that, this, was, due, to, an, asymmetric, effect, of, the, introduction, of, the, euro, on, prices, while, it, had, no, effect, on, most, goods, it, had, an, effect, on, cheap, goods, which, have, seen, their, price, round, up, after, the, introduction, of, the, euro, the, study, found, that, consumers, based, their, beliefs, on, inflation, of, those, cheap, goods, which, are, frequently, purchased, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, the, jump, in, small, prices, may, be, because, prior, to, the, introduction, retailers, made, fewer, upward, adjustments, and, waited, for, the, introduction, of, the, euro, to, do, so, based, on, the, introduction, of, the, euro, as, the, official, currency, in, croatia, in, 2023, the, ecb, argues, that, inflation, due, to, a, change, of, currency, is, a, one, time, effect, of, limited, impact, one, of, the, advantages, of, the, adoption, of, a, common, currency, is, the, reduction, of, the, risk, associated, with, changes, in, currency, exchange, rates, it, has, been, found, that, the, introduction, of, the, euro, created, significant, reductions, in, market, risk, exposures, for, nonfinancial, firms, both, in, and, outside, europe, these, reductions, in, market, risk, were, concentrated, in, firms, domiciled, in, the, eurozone, and, in, non, euro, firms, with, a, high, fraction, of, foreign, sales, or, assets, in, europe, the, introduction, of, the, euro, increased, european, financial, integration, which, helped, stimulate, growth, of, a, european, securities, market, bond, markets, are, characterized, by, economies, of, scale, dynamics, according, to, a, study, on, this, question, it, has, significantly, reshaped, the, european, financial, system, especially, with, respect, to, the, securities, markets, however, the, real, and, policy, barriers, to, integration, in, the, retail, and, corporate, banking, sectors, remain, significant, even, if, the, wholesale, end, of, banking, has, been, largely, integrated, specifically, the, euro, has, significantly, decreased, the, cost, of, trade, in, bonds, equity, and, banking, assets, within, the, eurozone, on, a, global, level, there, is, evidence, that, the, introduction, of, the, euro, has, led, to, an, integration, in, terms, of, investment, in, bond, portfolios, with, eurozone, countries, lending, and, borrowing, more, between, each, other, than, with, other, countries, financial, integration, made, it, cheaper, for, european, companies, to, borrow, banks, firms, and, households, could, also, invest, more, easily, outside, of, their, own, country, thus, creating, greater, international, risk, sharing, as, of, january, 2014, and, since, the, introduction, of, the, euro, interest, rates, of, most, member, countries, particularly, those, with, a, weak, currency, have, decreased, some, of, these, countries, had, the, most, serious, sovereign, financing, problems, the, effect, of, declining, interest, rates, combined, with, excess, liquidity, continually, provided, by, the, ecb, made, it, easier, for, banks, within, the, countries, in, which, interest, rates, fell, the, most, and, their, linked, sovereigns, to, borrow, significant, amounts, above, the, 3, of, gdp, budget, deficit, imposed, on, the, eurozone, initially, and, significantly, inflate, their, public, and, private, debt, levels, following, the, financial, crisis, of, 2007, 2008, governments, in, these, countries, found, it, necessary, to, bail, out, or, nationalise, their, privately, held, banks, to, prevent, systemic, failure, of, the, banking, system, when, underlying, hard, or, financial, asset, values, were, found, to, be, grossly, inflated, and, sometimes, so, nearly, worthless, there, was, no, liquid, market, for, them, this, further, increased, the, already, high, levels, of, public, debt, to, a, level, the, markets, began, to, consider, unsustainable, via, increasing, government, bond, interest, rates, producing, the, ongoing, european, sovereign, debt, crisis, the, evidence, on, the, convergence, of, prices, in, the, eurozone, with, the, introduction, of, the, euro, is, mixed, several, studies, failed, to, find, any, evidence, of, convergence, following, the, introduction, of, the, euro, after, a, phase, of, convergence, in, the, early, 1990s, other, studies, have, found, evidence, of, price, convergence, in, particular, for, cars, a, possible, reason, for, the, divergence, between, the, different, studies, is, that, the, processes, of, convergence, may, not, have, been, linear, slowing, down, substantially, between, 2000, and, 2003, and, resurfacing, after, 2003, as, suggested, by, a, recent, study, 2009, a, study, suggests, that, the, introduction, of, the, euro, has, had, a, positive, effect, on, the, amount, of, tourist, travel, within, the, emu, with, an, increase, of, 6, 5, the, ecb, targets, interest, rates, rather, than, exchange, rates, and, in, general, does, not, intervene, on, the, foreign, exchange, rate, markets, this, is, because, of, the, implications, of, the, mundell, fleming, model, which, implies, a, central, bank, cannot, without, capital, controls, maintain, interest, rate, and, exchange, rate, targets, simultaneously, because, increasing, the, money, supply, results, in, a, depreciation, of, the, currency, in, the, years, following, the, single, european, act, the, eu, has, liberalised, its, capital, markets, and, as, the, ecb, has, inflation, targeting, as, its, monetary, policy, the, exchange, rate, regime, of, the, euro, is, floating, the, euro, is, the, second, most, widely, held, reserve, currency, after, the, u, s, dollar, after, its, introduction, on, 4, january, 1999, its, exchange, rate, against, the, other, major, currencies, fell, reaching, its, lowest, exchange, rates, in, 2000, 3, may, vs, sterling, 25, october, vs, the, u, s, dollar, 26, october, vs, japanese, yen, afterwards, it, regained, and, its, exchange, rate, reached, its, historical, highest, point, in, 2008, 15, july, vs, us, dollar, 23, july, vs, japanese, yen, 29, december, vs, sterling, with, the, advent, of, the, global, financial, crisis, the, euro, initially, fell, to, regain, later, despite, pressure, due, to, the, european, sovereign, debt, crisis, the, euro, remained, stable, in, november, 2011, the, euro, s, exchange, rate, index, measured, against, currencies, of, the, bloc, s, major, trading, partners, was, trading, almost, two, percent, higher, on, the, year, approximately, at, the, same, level, as, it, was, before, the, crisis, began, in, 2007, in, mid, july, 2022, the, euro, and, the, us, dollar, traded, at, par, for, a, short, period, of, time, during, an, episode, of, dollar, appreciation, on, 11, july, 2024, it, recorded, a, new, high, against, the, japanese, yen, during, a, long, period, of, depreciation, of, the, latter, besides, the, economic, motivations, to, the, introduction, of, the, euro, its, creation, was, also, partly, justified, as, a, way, to, foster, a, closer, sense, of, joint, identity, between, european, citizens, statements, about, this, goal, were, for, instance, made, by, wim, duisenberg, european, central, bank, governor, in, 1998, laurent, fabius, french, finance, minister, in, 2000, and, romano, prodi, president, of, the, european, commission, in, 2002, however, 15, years, after, the, introduction, of, the, euro, a, study, found, no, evidence, that, it, has, had, any, effect, on, a, shared, sense, of, european, identity, the, formal, titles, of, the, currency, are, euro, for, the, major, unit, and, cent, for, the, minor, one, hundredth, unit, and, for, official, use, in, most, eurozone, languages, according, to, the, ecb, all, languages, should, use, the, same, spelling, for, the, nominative, singular, this, may, contradict, normal, rules, for, word, formation, in, some, languages,
