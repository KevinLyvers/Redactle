akkadian, k, e, d, i, n, akkadian, romanized, akkad, m, is, an, extinct, east, semitic, language, that, was, spoken, in, ancient, mesopotamia, akkad, assyria, isin, larsa, babylonia, and, perhaps, dilmun, from, the, third, millennium, bc, until, its, gradual, replacement, in, common, use, by, old, aramaic, among, assyrians, and, babylonians, from, the, 8th, century, bc, akkadian, which, is, the, earliest, documented, semitic, language, is, named, after, the, city, of, akkad, a, major, centre, of, mesopotamian, civilization, during, the, akkadian, empire, c, 2334, 2154, bc, it, was, written, using, the, cuneiform, script, originally, used, for, sumerian, but, also, used, to, write, multiple, languages, in, the, region, including, eblaite, hurrian, elamite, old, persian, and, hittite, the, influence, of, sumerian, on, akkadian, went, beyond, just, the, cuneiform, script, owing, to, their, close, proximity, a, lengthy, span, of, contact, and, the, prestige, held, by, the, former, sumerian, significantly, impacted, akkadian, phonology, vocabulary, and, syntax, this, mutual, influence, of, akkadian, and, sumerian, has, also, led, scholars, to, describe, the, languages, as, a, sprachbund, akkadian, proper, names, are, first, attested, in, sumerian, texts, in, the, mid, 3rd, millennium, bc, and, inscriptions, ostensibly, written, in, sumerian, but, whose, character, order, reveals, that, they, were, intended, to, be, read, in, east, semitic, presumably, early, akkadian, date, back, to, as, early, as, c, 2600, bc, from, about, the, 25th, century, bc, texts, fully, written, in, akkadian, begin, to, appear, by, the, 20th, century, bc, two, variant, dialectic, forms, of, the, same, language, were, in, use, in, assyria, and, babylonia, known, as, assyrian, and, babylonian, respectively, the, bulk, of, preserved, material, is, from, this, later, period, corresponding, to, the, near, eastern, iron, age, in, total, hundreds, of, thousands, of, texts, and, text, fragments, have, been, excavated, covering, a, vast, textual, tradition, of, religious, and, mythological, narrative, legal, texts, scientific, works, personal, correspondence, political, civil, and, military, events, economic, tracts, and, many, other, examples, centuries, after, the, fall, of, the, akkadian, empire, akkadian, in, its, assyrian, and, babylonian, varieties, was, the, native, language, of, the, mesopotamian, empires, old, assyrian, empire, babylonia, middle, assyrian, empire, throughout, the, later, bronze, age, and, became, the, lingua, franca, of, much, of, the, ancient, near, east, by, the, time, of, the, bronze, age, collapse, c, 1150, bc, however, its, gradual, decline, began, in, the, iron, age, during, the, neo, assyrian, empire, when, in, the, mid, eighth, century, bc, tiglath, pileser, iii, introduced, imperial, aramaic, as, a, lingua, franca, of, the, assyrian, empire, by, the, hellenistic, period, the, language, was, largely, confined, to, scholars, and, priests, working, in, temples, in, assyria, and, babylonia, the, last, known, akkadian, cuneiform, document, dates, from, the, 1st, century, ad, mandaic, spoken, by, mandean, gnostics, and, the, dialects, spoken, by, the, extant, assyrians, suret, are, three, extant, neo, aramaic, languages, that, retain, akkadian, vocabulary, and, grammatical, features, as, well, as, personal, and, family, names, these, are, spoken, by, assyrians, and, mandeans, mainly, in, northern, iraq, southeast, turkey, northeast, syria, northwest, iran, the, southern, caucasus, and, by, communities, in, the, assyrian, diaspora, akkadian, is, a, fusional, language, with, grammatical, case, like, all, semitic, languages, akkadian, uses, the, system, of, consonantal, roots, the, k, ltepe, texts, which, were, written, in, old, assyrian, include, hittite, loanwords, and, names, which, constitute, the, oldest, record, of, any, indo, european, language, akkadian, belongs, with, the, other, semitic, languages, in, the, near, eastern, branch, of, the, afroasiatic, languages, a, family, native, to, middle, east, arabian, peninsula, parts, of, anatolia, parts, of, the, horn, of, africa, north, africa, malta, canary, islands, and, parts, of, west, africa, hausa, akkadian, is, only, ever, attested, in, mesopotamia, and, neighboring, regions, in, the, near, east, within, the, near, eastern, semitic, languages, akkadian, forms, an, east, semitic, subgroup, with, eblaite, and, perhaps, dilmunite, this, group, differs, from, the, northwest, semitic, languages, and, south, semitic, languages, in, its, subject, object, verb, word, order, while, the, other, semitic, languages, usually, have, either, a, verb, subject, object, or, subject, verb, object, order, additionally, akkadian, is, the, only, semitic, language, to, use, the, prepositions, ina, and, ana, locative, case, english, in, on, with, and, dative, locative, case, for, to, respectively, other, semitic, languages, like, arabic, hebrew, and, aramaic, have, the, prepositions, bi, b, and, li, l, locative, and, dative, respectively, the, origin, of, the, akkadian, spatial, prepositions, is, unknown, in, contrast, to, most, other, semitic, languages, akkadian, has, only, one, non, sibilant, fricative, akkadian, lost, both, the, glottal, and, pharyngeal, fricatives, which, are, characteristic, of, the, other, semitic, languages, until, the, old, babylonian, period, the, akkadian, sibilants, were, exclusively, affricated, old, akkadian, is, preserved, on, clay, tablets, dating, back, to, c, 2500, bc, it, was, written, using, cuneiform, a, script, adopted, from, the, sumerians, using, wedge, shaped, symbols, pressed, in, wet, clay, as, employed, by, akkadian, scribes, the, adapted, cuneiform, script, could, represent, either, a, sumerian, logograms, i, e, picture, based, characters, representing, entire, words, b, sumerian, syllables, c, akkadian, syllables, or, d, phonetic, complements, in, akkadian, the, script, practically, became, a, fully, fledged, syllabic, script, and, the, original, logographic, nature, of, cuneiform, became, secondary, though, logograms, for, frequent, words, such, as, god, and, temple, continued, to, be, used, for, this, reason, the, sign, an, can, on, the, one, hand, be, a, logogram, for, the, word, ilum, god, and, on, the, other, signify, the, god, anu, or, even, the, syllable, an, additionally, this, sign, was, used, as, a, determinative, for, divine, names, another, peculiarity, of, akkadian, cuneiform, is, that, many, signs, do, not, have, a, well, defined, phonetic, value, certain, signs, such, as, a, do, not, distinguish, between, the, different, vowel, qualities, nor, is, there, any, coordination, in, the, other, direction, the, syllable, a, for, example, is, rendered, by, the, sign, a, but, also, by, the, sign, n, both, of, these, are, often, used, for, the, same, syllable, in, the, same, text, cuneiform, was, in, many, ways, unsuited, to, akkadian, among, its, flaws, was, its, inability, to, represent, important, phonemes, in, semitic, including, a, glottal, stop, pharyngeals, and, emphatic, consonants, in, addition, cuneiform, was, a, syllabary, writing, system, i, e, a, consonant, plus, vowel, comprised, one, writing, unit, frequently, inappropriate, for, a, semitic, language, made, up, of, triconsonantal, roots, i, e, three, consonants, plus, any, vowels, akkadian, is, divided, into, several, varieties, based, on, geography, and, historical, period, one, of, the, earliest, known, akkadian, inscriptions, was, found, on, a, bowl, at, ur, addressed, to, the, very, early, pre, sargonic, king, meskiagnunna, of, ur, c, 2485, 2450, bc, by, his, queen, gan, saman, who, is, thought, to, have, been, from, akkad, the, akkadian, empire, established, by, sargon, of, akkad, introduced, the, akkadian, language, the, language, of, akkad, as, a, written, language, adapting, sumerian, cuneiform, orthography, for, the, purpose, during, the, middle, bronze, age, old, assyrian, and, old, babylonian, period, the, language, virtually, displaced, sumerian, which, is, assumed, to, have, been, extinct, as, a, living, language, by, the, 18th, century, bc, old, akkadian, which, was, used, until, the, end, of, the, 3rd, millennium, bc, differed, from, both, babylonian, and, assyrian, and, was, displaced, by, these, dialects, by, the, 21st, century, bc, babylonian, and, assyrian, which, were, to, become, the, primary, dialects, were, easily, distinguishable, old, babylonian, along, with, the, closely, related, dialect, mariotic, is, clearly, more, innovative, than, the, old, assyrian, dialect, and, the, more, distantly, related, eblaite, language, for, this, reason, forms, like, lu, prus, i, will, decide, were, first, encountered, in, old, babylonian, instead, of, the, older, la, prus, while, generally, more, archaic, assyrian, developed, certain, innovations, as, well, such, as, the, assyrian, vowel, harmony, eblaite, was, even, more, so, retaining, a, productive, dual, and, a, relative, pronoun, declined, in, case, number, and, gender, both, of, these, had, already, disappeared, in, old, akkadian, over, 20, 000, cuneiform, tablets, in, old, assyrian, have, been, recovered, from, the, k, ltepe, site, in, anatolia, most, of, the, archaeological, evidence, is, typical, of, anatolia, rather, than, of, assyria, but, the, use, both, of, cuneiform, and, the, dialect, is, the, best, indication, of, assyrian, presence, old, babylonian, was, the, language, of, king, hammurabi, and, his, code, which, is, one, of, the, oldest, collections, of, laws, in, the, world, see, code, of, ur, nammu, old, assyrian, developed, as, well, during, the, second, millennium, bc, but, because, it, was, a, purely, popular, language, kings, wrote, in, babylonian, few, long, texts, are, preserved, it, was, however, notably, used, in, the, correspondence, of, assyrian, traders, in, anatolia, in, the, 20th, 18th, centuries, bc, and, that, even, led, to, its, temporary, adoption, as, a, diplomatic, language, by, various, local, anatolian, polities, during, that, time, the, middle, babylonian, period, started, in, the, 16th, century, bc, the, division, is, marked, by, the, kassite, invasion, of, babylonia, around, 1550, bc, the, kassites, who, reigned, for, 300, years, gave, up, their, own, language, in, favor, of, akkadian, but, they, had, little, influence, on, the, language, at, its, apogee, middle, babylonian, was, the, written, language, of, diplomacy, of, the, entire, ancient, near, east, including, egypt, amarna, period, during, this, period, a, large, number, of, loan, words, were, included, in, the, language, from, northwest, semitic, languages, and, hurrian, however, the, use, of, these, words, was, confined, to, the, fringes, of, the, akkadian, speaking, territory, from, 1500, bc, onwards, the, assyrian, language, is, termed, middle, assyrian, it, was, the, language, of, the, middle, assyrian, empire, however, the, babylonian, cultural, influence, was, strong, and, the, assyrians, wrote, royal, inscriptions, religious, and, most, scholarly, texts, in, middle, babylonian, whereas, middle, assyrian, was, used, mostly, in, letters, and, administrative, documents, during, the, first, millennium, bc, akkadian, progressively, lost, its, status, as, a, lingua, franca, in, the, beginning, from, around, 1000, bc, akkadian, and, aramaic, were, of, equal, status, as, can, be, seen, in, the, number, of, copied, texts, clay, tablets, were, written, in, akkadian, while, scribes, writing, on, papyrus, and, leather, used, aramaic, from, this, period, on, one, speaks, of, neo, babylonian, and, neo, assyrian, neo, assyrian, received, an, upswing, in, popularity, in, the, 10th, century, bc, when, the, assyrian, kingdom, became, a, major, power, with, the, neo, assyrian, empire, during, the, existence, of, that, empire, however, neo, assyrian, began, to, turn, into, a, chancellery, language, being, marginalized, by, old, aramaic, the, dominance, of, the, neo, assyrian, empire, under, tiglath, pileser, iii, over, aram, damascus, in, the, middle, of, the, 8th, century, led, to, the, establishment, of, aramaic, as, a, lingua, franca, of, the, empire, rather, than, it, being, eclipsed, by, akkadian, texts, written, exclusively, in, neo, assyrian, disappear, within, 10, years, of, nineveh, s, destruction, in, 612, bc, under, the, achaemenids, aramaic, continued, to, prosper, but, assyrian, continued, its, decline, the, language, s, final, demise, came, about, during, the, hellenistic, period, when, it, was, further, marginalized, by, koine, greek, even, though, neo, assyrian, cuneiform, remained, in, use, in, literary, tradition, well, into, parthian, times, similarly, the, persian, conquest, of, the, mesopotamian, kingdoms, contributed, to, the, decline, of, babylonian, from, that, point, on, known, as, late, babylonian, as, a, popular, language, however, the, language, was, still, used, in, its, written, form, even, after, the, greek, invasion, under, alexander, the, great, in, the, 4th, century, bc, akkadian, was, still, a, contender, as, a, written, language, but, spoken, akkadian, was, likely, extinct, by, this, time, or, at, least, rarely, used, the, last, positively, identified, akkadian, text, comes, from, the, 1st, century, ad, the, latest, known, text, in, cuneiform, babylonian, is, an, astronomical, almanac, dated, to, 79, 80, ad, however, the, latest, cuneiform, texts, are, almost, entirely, written, in, sumerian, logograms, the, akkadian, language, began, to, be, rediscovered, when, carsten, niebuhr, in, 1767, was, able, to, make, extensive, copies, of, cuneiform, texts, and, published, them, in, denmark, the, deciphering, of, the, texts, started, immediately, and, bilinguals, in, particular, old, persian, akkadian, bilinguals, were, of, great, help, since, the, texts, contained, several, royal, names, isolated, signs, could, be, identified, and, were, presented, in, 1802, by, georg, friedrich, grotefend, by, this, time, it, was, already, evident, that, akkadian, was, a, semitic, language, and, the, final, breakthrough, in, deciphering, the, language, came, from, edward, hincks, henry, rawlinson, and, jules, oppert, in, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, in, the, early, 21st, century, it, was, shown, that, automatic, high, quality, translation, of, akkadian, can, be, achieved, using, natural, language, processing, methods, such, as, convolutional, neural, networks, the, following, table, summarises, the, dialects, of, akkadian, identified, with, certainty, so, far, some, researchers, such, as, w, sommerfeld, 2003, believe, that, the, old, akkadian, variant, used, in, the, older, texts, is, not, an, ancestor, of, the, later, assyrian, and, babylonian, dialects, but, rather, a, separate, dialect, that, was, replaced, by, these, two, dialects, and, which, died, out, early, eblaite, formerly, thought, of, as, yet, another, akkadian, dialect, is, now, generally, considered, a, separate, east, semitic, language, because, akkadian, as, a, spoken, language, is, extinct, and, no, contemporary, descriptions, of, the, pronunciation, are, known, little, can, be, said, with, certainty, about, the, phonetics, and, phonology, of, akkadian, some, conclusions, can, be, made, however, due, to, the, relationship, to, the, other, semitic, languages, and, variant, spellings, of, akkadian, words, the, following, table, presents, the, consonants, of, the, akkadian, language, as, distinguished, in, akkadian, cuneiform, the, reconstructed, phonetic, value, of, a, phoneme, is, given, in, ipa, transcription, alongside, its, standard, dmg, umschrift, transliteration, in, angle, brackets, evidence, from, borrowings, from, and, to, sumerian, has, been, interpreted, as, indicating, that, the, akkadian, voiceless, non, emphatic, stops, were, originally, unaspirated, but, became, aspirated, around, 2000, bce, akkadian, emphatic, consonants, are, typically, reconstructed, as, ejectives, which, are, thought, to, be, the, oldest, realization, of, emphatics, across, the, semitic, languages, one, piece, of, evidence, for, this, is, that, akkadian, shows, a, development, known, as, geers, s, law, where, one, of, two, emphatic, consonants, dissimilates, to, the, corresponding, non, emphatic, consonant, for, the, sibilants, traditionally, has, been, held, to, be, postalveolar, and, s, z, analyzed, as, fricatives, but, attested, assimilations, in, akkadian, suggest, otherwise, for, example, when, the, possessive, suffix, u, is, added, to, the, root, awat, word, it, is, written, awassu, his, word, even, though, would, be, expected, the, most, straightforward, interpretation, of, this, shift, from, t, to, ss, is, that, s, form, a, pair, of, voiceless, alveolar, affricates, is, a, voiceless, alveolar, fricative, and, z, is, a, voiced, alveolar, affricate, or, fricative, the, assimilation, is, then, in, this, vein, an, alternative, transcription, of, is, s, with, the, macron, below, indicating, a, soft, lenis, articulation, in, semitic, transcription, other, interpretations, are, possible, could, have, been, assimilated, to, the, preceding, yielding, which, would, later, have, been, simplified, to, the, phoneme, r, has, traditionally, been, interpreted, as, a, trill, but, its, pattern, of, alternation, with, suggests, it, was, a, velar, or, uvular, fricative, in, the, hellenistic, period, akkadian, r, was, transcribed, using, the, greek, indicating, it, was, pronounced, similarly, as, an, alveolar, trill, though, greeks, may, also, have, perceived, a, uvular, trill, as, several, proto, semitic, phonemes, are, lost, in, akkadian, the, proto, semitic, glottal, stop, as, well, as, the, fricatives, h, are, lost, as, consonants, either, by, sound, change, or, orthographically, but, they, gave, rise, to, the, vowel, quality, e, not, exhibited, in, proto, semitic, the, voiceless, lateral, fricatives, merged, with, the, sibilants, as, in, canaanite, leaving, 19, consonantal, phonemes, old, akkadian, preserved, the, phoneme, longest, but, it, eventually, merged, with, beginning, in, the, old, babylonian, period, the, following, table, shows, proto, semitic, phonemes, and, their, correspondences, among, akkadian, modern, standard, arabic, and, tiberian, hebrew, the, existence, of, a, back, mid, vowel, o, has, been, proposed, but, the, cuneiform, writing, gives, no, good, proof, for, this, there, is, limited, contrast, between, different, u, signs, in, lexical, texts, but, this, scribal, differentiation, may, reflect, the, superimposition, of, the, sumerian, phonological, system, for, which, an, o, phoneme, has, also, been, proposed, rather, than, a, separate, phoneme, in, akkadian, all, consonants, and, vowels, appear, in, long, and, short, forms, long, consonants, are, transliterated, as, double, consonants, and, inconsistently, written, as, such, in, cuneiform, long, vowels, are, transliterated, with, a, macron, or, a, circumflex, the, latter, being, used, for, long, vowels, arising, from, the, contraction, of, vowels, in, hiatus, the, distinction, between, long, and, short, is, phonemic, and, is, used, in, the, grammar, for, example, iprusu, that, he, decided, versus, iprus, they, decided, there, is, broad, agreement, among, most, assyriologists, about, akkadian, stress, patterns, the, rules, of, akkadian, stress, were, originally, reconstructed, by, means, of, a, comparison, with, other, semitic, languages, and, the, resulting, picture, was, gradually, amended, using, internal, linguistic, evidence, from, akkadian, sources, especially, deriving, from, so, called, plene, spellings, spellings, with, an, extra, vowel, according, to, this, widely, accepted, system, the, place, of, stress, in, akkadian, is, completely, predictable, and, sensitive, to, syllable, weight, there, are, three, syllable, weights, light, ending, in, v, heavy, ending, in, v, or, vc, and, superheavy, ending, in, v, v, c, or, v, c, if, the, last, syllable, is, superheavy, it, is, stressed, otherwise, the, rightmost, heavy, non, final, syllable, is, stressed, if, a, word, contains, only, light, syllables, the, first, syllable, is, stressed, it, has, also, been, argued, that, monosyllabic, words, generally, are, not, stressed, but, rather, function, as, clitics, the, special, behaviour, of, v, syllables, is, explained, by, their, functioning, in, accordance, with, their, historical, origin, as, sequences, of, two, syllables, of, which, the, first, one, bears, stress, a, rule, of, akkadian, phonology, is, that, certain, short, and, probably, unstressed, vowels, are, dropped, the, rule, is, that, the, last, vowel, of, a, succession, of, syllables, that, end, in, a, short, vowel, is, dropped, for, example, the, declinational, root, of, the, verbal, adjective, of, a, root, prs, is, paris, thus, the, masculine, singular, nominative, is, pars, um, paris, um, but, the, feminine, singular, nominative, is, paristum, paris, at, um, additionally, there, is, a, general, tendency, of, syncope, of, short, vowels, in, the, later, stages, of, akkadian, most, roots, of, the, akkadian, language, consist, of, three, consonants, called, the, radicals, but, some, roots, are, composed, of, four, consonants, so, called, quadriradicals, the, radicals, are, occasionally, represented, in, transcription, in, upper, case, letters, for, example, prs, to, decide, between, and, around, these, radicals, various, infixes, suffixes, and, prefixes, having, word, generating, or, grammatical, functions, are, inserted, the, resulting, consonant, vowel, pattern, differentiates, the, original, meaning, of, the, root, the, middle, radical, can, be, geminated, which, is, represented, by, a, doubled, consonant, in, transcription, and, sometimes, in, the, cuneiform, writing, itself, the, consonants, w, j, and, n, are, termed, weak, radicals, and, roots, containing, these, radicals, give, rise, to, irregular, forms, formally, akkadian, has, three, numbers, singular, dual, and, plural, and, three, cases, nominative, accusative, and, genitive, however, even, in, the, earlier, stages, of, the, language, the, dual, number, is, vestigial, and, its, use, is, largely, confined, to, natural, pairs, eyes, ears, etc, adjectives, are, never, found, in, the, dual, in, the, dual, and, plural, the, accusative, and, genitive, are, merged, into, a, single, oblique, case, akkadian, unlike, arabic, has, only, sound, plurals, formed, by, means, of, a, plural, ending, broken, plurals, are, not, formed, by, changing, the, word, stem, as, in, all, semitic, languages, some, masculine, nouns, take, the, prototypically, feminine, plural, ending, t, the, nouns, arrum, king, and, arratum, queen, and, the, adjective, dannum, strong, will, serve, to, illustrate, the, case, system, of, akkadian, as, is, clear, from, the, above, table, the, adjective, and, noun, endings, differ, only, in, the, masculine, plural, certain, nouns, primarily, those, referring, to, geography, can, also, form, a, locative, ending, in, um, in, the, singular, and, the, resulting, forms, serve, as, adverbials, these, forms, are, generally, not, productive, but, in, the, neo, babylonian, the, um, locative, replaces, several, constructions, with, the, preposition, ina, in, the, later, stages, of, akkadian, the, mimation, word, final, m, and, nunation, dual, final, n, that, occurred, at, the, end, of, most, case, endings, disappeared, except, in, the, locative, later, the, nominative, and, accusative, singular, of, masculine, nouns, collapsed, to, u, and, in, neo, babylonian, most, word, final, short, vowels, were, dropped, as, a, result, case, differentiation, disappeared, from, all, forms, except, masculine, plural, nouns, however, many, texts, continued, the, practice, of, writing, the, case, endings, although, often, sporadically, and, incorrectly, as, the, most, important, contact, language, throughout, this, period, was, aramaic, which, itself, lacks, case, distinctions, it, is, possible, that, akkadian, s, loss, of, cases, was, an, areal, as, well, as, phonological, phenomenon, as, is, also, the, case, in, other, semitic, languages, akkadian, nouns, may, appear, in, a, variety, of, states, depending, on, their, grammatical, function, in, a, sentence, the, basic, form, of, the, noun, is, the, status, rectus, the, governed, state, which, is, the, form, as, described, above, complete, with, case, endings, in, addition, to, this, akkadian, has, the, status, absolutus, the, absolute, state, and, the, status, constructus, construct, state, the, latter, is, found, in, all, other, semitic, languages, while, the, former, appears, only, in, akkadian, and, some, dialects, of, aramaic, the, status, absolutus, is, characterised, by, the, loss, of, a, noun, s, case, ending, e, g, aw, l, aw, lum, ar, arrum, it, is, relatively, uncommon, and, is, used, chiefly, to, mark, the, predicate, of, a, nominal, sentence, in, fixed, adverbial, expressions, and, in, expressions, relating, to, measurements, of, length, weight, and, the, like, aw, l, um, man, nom, 3sg, masc, arr, q, thief, absolutus, aw, l, um, arr, q, man, nom, 3sg, masc, thief, absolutus, this, man, is, a, thief, arrum, king, nom, rectus, l, neg, an, n, oppose, inf, absolutus, arrum, l, an, n, king, nom, rectus, neg, oppose, inf, absolutus, the, king, who, cannot, be, rivaled, the, status, constructus, is, more, common, by, far, and, has, a, much, wider, range, of, applications, it, is, employed, when, a, noun, is, followed, by, another, noun, in, the, genitive, a, pronominal, suffix, or, a, verbal, clause, in, the, subjunctive, and, typically, takes, the, shortest, form, of, the, noun, which, is, phonetically, possible, in, general, this, amounts, to, the, loss, of, case, endings, with, short, vowels, with, the, exception, of, the, genitive, i, in, nouns, preceding, a, pronominal, suffix, hence, m, ri, u, son, constructus, 3sg, poss, m, ri, u, son, constructus, 3sg, poss, his, son, its, masculine, son, but, m, r, son, constructus, arr, im, king, gen, sg, m, r, arr, im, son, constructus, king, gen, sg, the, king, s, son, there, are, numerous, exceptions, to, this, general, rule, usually, involving, potential, violations, of, the, language, s, phonological, limitations, most, obviously, akkadian, does, not, tolerate, word, final, consonant, clusters, so, nouns, like, kalbum, dog, and, ma, rum, front, would, have, illegal, construct, state, forms, kalb, and, ma, r, unless, modified, in, many, of, these, instances, the, first, vowel, of, the, word, is, simply, repeated, e, g, kalab, ma, ar, this, rule, however, does, not, always, hold, true, especially, in, nouns, where, a, short, vowel, has, historically, been, elided, e, g, aknum, akinum, governor, in, these, cases, the, lost, vowel, is, restored, in, the, construct, state, so, aknum, yields, akin, kalab, dog, constructus, belim, master, gen, sg, kalab, belim, dog, constructus, master, gen, sg, the, master, s, dog, akin, governor, constructus, lim, city, gen, sg, akin, lim, governor, constructus, city, gen, sg, the, city, s, governor, a, genitive, relation, can, also, be, expressed, with, the, relative, preposition, a, and, the, noun, that, the, genitive, phrase, depends, on, appears, in, status, rectus, sal, m, tum, alliances, nom, rectus, a, which, aw, l, man, constructus, e, nunna, e, nunna, gen, sal, m, tum, a, aw, l, e, nunna, alliances, nom, rectus, which, man, constructus, e, nunna, gen, the, alliances, of, the, ruler, of, e, nunna, lit, alliances, which, man, of, e, nunna, has, the, same, preposition, is, also, used, to, introduce, true, relative, clauses, in, which, case, the, verb, is, placed, in, the, subjunctive, mood, aw, l, um, man, nom, a, that, m, t, am, land, sg, acc, i, k, ud, u, 3, conquer, pret, sg, masc, sjv, aw, l, um, a, m, t, am, i, k, ud, u, man, nom, that, land, sg, acc, 3, conquer, pret, sg, masc, sjv, the, man, who, conquered, the, land, the, akkadian, verb, has, six, finite, verb, aspects, preterite, perfect, present, imperative, precative, and, vetitive, the, negative, form, of, precative, and, three, infinite, forms, infinitive, participle, and, verbal, adjective, the, preterite, is, used, for, actions, that, are, seen, by, the, speaker, as, having, occurred, at, a, single, point, in, time, the, present, is, primarily, imperfective, in, meaning, and, is, used, for, concurrent, and, future, actions, as, well, as, past, actions, with, a, temporal, dimension, the, final, three, finite, forms, are, injunctive, where, the, imperative, and, the, precative, together, form, a, paradigm, for, positive, commands, and, wishes, and, the, vetitive, is, used, for, negative, wishes, the, periphrastic, prohibitive, formed, by, the, present, form, of, the, verb, and, the, negative, adverb, l, is, used, to, express, negative, commands, the, infinitive, of, the, akkadian, verb, is, a, verbal, noun, and, in, contrast, to, some, other, languages, the, akkadian, infinitive, can, be, declined, in, case, the, verbal, adjective, is, an, adjectival, form, and, designates, the, state, or, the, result, of, the, action, of, the, verb, and, consequently, the, exact, meaning, of, the, verbal, adjective, is, determined, by, the, semantics, of, the, verb, itself, the, participle, which, can, be, active, or, passive, is, another, verbal, adjective, and, its, meaning, is, similar, to, the, english, gerund, the, following, table, shows, the, conjugation, of, the, g, stem, verbs, derived, from, the, root, prs, to, decide, in, the, various, verb, aspects, of, akkadian, the, table, below, shows, the, different, affixes, attached, to, the, preterite, aspect, of, the, verb, root, prs, to, decide, and, as, can, be, seen, the, grammatical, genders, differ, only, in, the, second, person, singular, and, third, person, plural, akkadian, verbs, have, three, moods, the, following, table, demonstrates, the, verb, moods, of, verbs, derived, from, the, root, prs, to, decide, to, separate, akkadian, verbs, have, thirteen, separate, derived, stems, formed, on, each, root, the, basic, underived, stem, is, the, g, stem, from, the, german, grundstamm, meaning, basic, stem, causative, or, intensive, forms, are, formed, with, the, doubled, d, stem, and, it, gets, its, name, from, the, doubled, middle, radical, that, is, characteristic, of, this, form, the, doubled, middle, radical, is, also, characteristic, of, the, present, the, forms, of, the, d, stem, use, the, secondary, conjugational, affixes, so, a, d, form, will, never, be, identical, to, a, form, in, a, different, stem, the, stem, is, formed, by, adding, a, prefix, and, these, forms, are, mostly, causatives, the, passive, forms, of, the, verb, are, in, the, n, stem, formed, by, adding, a, n, prefix, the, n, element, is, assimilated, to, a, following, consonant, so, the, original, n, is, only, visible, in, a, few, forms, reflexive, and, iterative, verbal, stems, can, be, derived, from, each, of, the, basic, stems, the, reflexive, stem, is, formed, with, an, infix, ta, and, the, derived, stems, are, therefore, called, gt, dt, t, and, nt, and, the, preterite, forms, of, the, xt, stem, are, identical, to, the, perfects, of, the, x, stem, iteratives, are, formed, with, the, infix, tan, giving, the, gtn, dtn, tn, and, ntn, because, of, the, assimilation, of, n, the, n, is, only, seen, in, the, present, forms, and, the, xtn, preterite, is, identical, to, the, xt, durative, the, final, stem, is, the, d, stem, a, form, mostly, attested, only, in, poetic, texts, and, whose, meaning, is, usually, identical, to, either, the, stem, or, the, d, stem, of, the, same, verb, it, is, formed, with, the, prefix, like, the, stem, in, addition, to, a, doubled, middle, radical, like, the, d, stem, an, alternative, to, this, naming, system, is, a, numerical, system, the, basic, stems, are, numbered, using, roman, numerals, so, that, g, d, and, n, become, i, ii, iii, and, iv, respectively, the, infixes, are, numbered, using, arabic, numerals, 1, for, the, forms, without, an, infix, 2, for, the, xt, and, 3, for, the, xtn, the, two, numbers, are, separated, using, a, solidus, as, an, example, the, tn, stem, is, called, iii, 3, the, most, important, user, of, this, system, is, the, chicago, assyrian, dictionary, there, is, mandatory, congruence, between, the, subject, of, the, sentence, and, the, verb, this, is, expressed, by, prefixes, and, suffixes, there, are, two, different, sets, of, affixes, a, primary, set, used, for, the, forms, of, the, g, and, n, stems, and, a, secondary, set, for, the, d, and, stems, the, stems, their, nomenclature, and, examples, of, the, third, person, masculine, singular, stative, of, the, verb, par, sum, root, prs, to, decide, distinguish, separate, is, shown, below, a, very, often, appearing, form, which, can, be, formed, by, nouns, adjectives, as, well, as, by, verbal, adjectives, is, the, stative, nominal, predicatives, occur, in, the, status, absolutus, and, correspond, to, the, verb, to, be, in, english, the, stative, in, akkadian, corresponds, to, the, egyptian, pseudo, participle, the, following, table, contains, an, example, of, using, the, noun, arrum, king, the, adjective, rap, um, wide, and, the, verbal, adjective, parsum, decided, thus, the, stative, in, akkadian, is, used, to, convert, simple, stems, into, effective, sentences, so, that, the, form, arr, ta, is, equivalent, to, you, were, king, you, are, king, and, you, will, be, king, hence, the, stative, is, independent, of, time, forms, beside, the, already, explained, possibility, of, derivation, of, different, verb, stems, akkadian, has, numerous, nominal, formations, derived, from, verb, roots, a, very, frequently, encountered, form, is, the, mapras, form, it, can, express, the, location, of, an, event, the, person, performing, the, act, and, many, other, meanings, if, one, of, the, root, consonants, is, labial, p, b, m, the, prefix, becomes, na, mapras, napras, examples, for, this, are, ma, kanum, place, location, from, kn, set, place, put, ma, ra, um, splendour, from, r, be, splendid, ma, arum, guards, from, n, r, guard, nap, arum, sum, from, p, r, summarize, a, very, similar, formation, is, the, maprast, form, the, noun, derived, from, this, nominal, formation, is, grammatically, feminine, the, same, rules, as, for, the, mapras, form, apply, for, example, ma, kattum, deposit, from, kn, set, place, put, narkabtum, carriage, from, rkb, ride, drive, mount, the, suffix, t, is, used, to, derive, abstract, nouns, the, nouns, which, are, formed, with, this, suffix, are, grammatically, feminine, the, suffix, can, be, attached, to, nouns, adjectives, and, verbs, e, g, ab, tum, paternity, from, abum, father, rab, tum, size, from, rab, m, large, wa, tum, leaving, from, w, y, leave, also, derivatives, of, verbs, from, nouns, adjectives, and, numerals, are, numerous, for, the, most, part, a, d, stem, is, derived, from, the, root, of, the, noun, or, adjective, the, derived, verb, then, has, the, meaning, of, make, x, do, something, or, becoming, x, for, example, du, m, let, sprout, from, d, um, grass, ullu, um, to, do, something, for, the, third, time, from, al, three, independent, personal, pronouns, in, akkadian, are, as, follows, suffixed, or, enclitic, pronouns, mainly, denoting, the, genitive, accusative, and, dative, are, as, follows, demonstrative, pronouns, in, akkadian, differ, from, the, western, semitic, variety, the, following, tables, show, the, akkadian, demonstrative, pronouns, according, to, near, and, far, deixis, relative, pronouns, in, akkadian, are, shown, in, the, following, table, unlike, plural, relative, pronouns, singular, relative, pronouns, in, akkadian, exhibit, full, declension, for, case, only, the, form, a, originally, accusative, masculine, singular, survived, while, the, other, forms, disappeared, in, time, the, following, table, shows, the, interrogative, pronouns, used, in, akkadian, akkadian, has, prepositions, which, consist, mainly, of, only, one, word, for, example, ina, in, on, out, through, under, ana, to, for, after, approximately, adi, to, a, um, because, of, eli, up, over, i, tu, ultu, of, since, mala, in, accordance, with, itti, also, with, there, are, some, compound, prepositions, which, are, combined, with, ina, and, ana, e, g, ina, ma, ar, forwards, ina, balu, without, ana, r, up, to, ana, ma, ar, forwards, regardless, of, the, complexity, of, the, preposition, the, following, noun, is, always, in, the, genitive, case, examples, ina, b, tim, in, the, house, from, the, house, ana, dummuqim, to, do, good, itti, arrim, with, the, king, ana, r, m, r, u, up, to, his, son, since, numerals, are, written, mostly, as, a, number, sign, in, the, cuneiform, script, the, transliteration, of, many, numerals, is, not, well, ascertained, yet, along, with, the, counted, noun, the, cardinal, numerals, are, in, the, status, absolutus, because, other, cases, are, very, rare, the, forms, of, the, status, rectus, are, known, only, by, isolated, numerals, the, numerals, 1, and, 2, as, well, as, 21, 29, 31, 39, 41, 49, correspond, with, the, counted, in, the, grammatical, gender, the, numerals, 3, 20, 30, 40, and, 50, are, characterized, by, polarity, of, gender, i, e, if, the, counted, noun, is, masculine, the, numeral, would, be, feminine, and, vice, versa, this, polarity, is, typical, of, the, semitic, languages, and, appears, for, example, in, classical, arabic, the, numerals, 60, 100, and, 1, 000, do, not, change, according, to, the, gender, of, the, counted, noun, counted, nouns, more, than, two, appear, in, the, plural, form, body, parts, that, occur, in, pairs, appear, in, the, dual, form, in, akkadian, e, g, pum, foot, becomes, p, n, two, feet, the, ordinals, are, formed, with, few, exceptions, by, adding, a, case, ending, to, the, nominal, form, parus, the, p, r, and, s, must, be, substituted, with, the, suitable, consonants, of, the, numeral, it, is, noted, that, in, the, case, of, the, numeral, one, the, ordinal, masculine, and, the, cardinal, number, are, the, same, a, metathesis, occurs, in, the, numeral, four, examples, erb, a, tum, four, wives, masculine, numeral, meat, l, n, 100, towns, adjectives, relative, clauses, and, appositions, follow, the, noun, while, numerals, precede, the, counted, noun, in, the, following, table, the, nominal, phrase, erb, t, arr, dann, tum, a, lam, pu, ab, ya, the, four, strong, kings, who, built, the, city, are, my, fathers, is, analyzed, akkadian, sentence, order, was, subject, object, verb, sov, which, sets, it, apart, from, most, other, ancient, semitic, languages, such, as, arabic, and, biblical, hebrew, which, typically, have, a, verb, subject, object, vso, word, order, modern, south, semitic, languages, in, ethiopia, also, have, sov, order, but, these, developed, within, historical, times, from, the, classical, verb, subject, object, vso, language, ge, ez, it, has, been, hypothesized, that, this, word, order, was, a, result, of, influence, from, the, sumerian, language, which, was, also, sov, there, is, evidence, that, native, speakers, of, both, languages, were, in, intimate, language, contact, forming, a, single, society, for, at, least, 500, years, so, it, is, entirely, likely, that, a, sprachbund, could, have, formed, further, evidence, of, an, original, vso, or, svo, ordering, can, be, found, in, the, fact, that, direct, and, indirect, object, pronouns, are, suffixed, to, the, verb, word, order, seems, to, have, shifted, to, svo, vso, late, in, the, 1st, millennium, bc, to, the, 1st, millennium, ad, possibly, under, the, influence, of, aramaic, the, akkadian, vocabulary, is, mostly, of, semitic, origin, although, classified, as, east, semitic, many, elements, of, its, basic, vocabulary, find, no, evident, parallels, in, related, semitic, languages, m, rum, son, semitic, bn, q, tum, hand, semitic, yd, pum, foot, semitic,

words, from, these, languages, aramaic, loan, words, were, limited, to, the, 1st, centuries, of, the, 1st, millennium, bc, and, primarily, in, the, north, and, middle, parts, of, mesopotamia, sumerian, loan, words, were, spread, in, the, whole, linguistic, area, beside, the, previous, languages, some, nouns, were, borrowed, from, hurrian, kassite, ugaritic, and, other, ancient, languages, since, sumerian, and, hurrian, two, non, semitic, languages, differ, from, akkadian, in, word, structure, only, nouns, and, some, adjectives, not, many, verbs, were, borrowed, from, these, languages, some, verbs, were, borrowed, along, with, many, nouns, from, aramaic, and, ugaritic, both, of, which, are, semitic, languages, the, following, table, contains, examples, of, loan, words, in, akkadian, akkadian, was, also, a, source, of, borrowing, to, other, semitic, languages, such, as, bi, ru, onion, into, arabic, romanized, ba, al, and, hebrew, romanized, betsel, su, myrtle, s, and, so, on, above, all, sumerian, with, examples, sumerian, da, ri, lastingly, from, akkadian, d, rum, sumerian, ra, gaba, riders, messenger, from, akkadian, r, kibum, in, 2011, the, oriental, institute, of, the,

with, the, first, volume, published, in, 1956, the, completion, of, this, work, was, hailed, as, a, significant, milestone, for, the, study, of, the, language, by, prominent, academic, irving, finkel,
