linguistic, anthropology, is, the, interdisciplinary, study, of, how, language, influences, social, life, it, is, a, branch, of, anthropology, that, originated, from, the, endeavor, to, document, endangered, languages, and, has, grown, over, the, past, century, to, encompass, most, aspects, of, language, structure, and, use, linguistic, anthropology, explores, how, language, shapes, communication, forms, social, identity, and, group, membership, organizes, large, scale, cultural, beliefs, and, ideologies, and, develops, a, common, cultural, representation, of, natural, and, social, worlds, linguistic, anthropology, emerged, from, the, development, of, three, distinct, paradigms, that, have, set, the, standard, for, approaching, linguistic, anthropology, the, first, now, known, as, anthropological, linguistics, focuses, on, the, documentation, of, languages, the, second, known, as, linguistic, anthropology, engages, in, theoretical, studies, of, language, use, the, third, developed, over, the, past, two, or, three, decades, studies, issues, from, other, subfields, of, anthropology, with, linguistic, considerations, though, they, developed, sequentially, all, three, paradigms, are, still, practiced, today, the, first, paradigm, anthropological, linguistics, is, devoted, to, themes, unique, to, the, sub, discipline, this, area, includes, documentation, of, languages, that, have, been, seen, as, at, risk, for, extinction, with, a, particular, focus, on, indigenous, languages, of, native, north, american, tribes, it, is, also, the, paradigm, most, focused, on, linguistics, linguistic, themes, include, the, following, the, second, paradigm, can, be, marked, by, reversing, the, words, going, from, anthropological, linguistics, to, linguistic, anthropology, signals, a, more, anthropological, focus, on, the, study, this, term, was, preferred, by, dell, hymes, who, was, also, responsible, with, john, gumperz, for, the, idea, of, ethnography, of, communication, the, term, linguistic, anthropology, reflected, hymes, vision, of, a, future, where, language, would, be, studied, in, the, context, of, the, situation, and, relative, to, the, community, speaking, it, this, new, era, would, involve, many, new, technological, developments, such, as, mechanical, recording, this, paradigm, developed, in, critical, dialogue, with, the, fields, of, folklore, on, the, one, hand, and, linguistics, on, the, other, hymes, criticized, folklorists, fixation, on, oral, texts, rather, than, the, verbal, artistry, of, performance, at, the, same, time, he, criticized, the, cognitivist, shift, in, linguistics, heralded, by, the, pioneering, work, of, noam, chomsky, arguing, for, an, ethnographic, focus, on, language, in, use, hymes, had, many, revolutionary, contributions, to, linguistic, anthropology, the, first, of, which, was, a, new, unit, of, analysis, unlike, the, first, paradigm, which, focused, on, linguistic, tools, like, measuring, of, phonemes, and, morphemes, the, second, paradigm, s, unit, of, analysis, was, the, speech, event, a, speech, event, is, defined, as, one, with, speech, presented, for, a, significant, duration, throughout, its, occurrence, ex, a, lecture, or, debate, this, is, different, from, a, speech, situation, where, speech, could, possibly, occur, ex, dinner, hymes, also, pioneered, a, linguistic, anthropological, approach, to, ethnopoetics, hymes, had, hoped, that, this, paradigm, would, link, linguistic, anthropology, more, to, anthropology, however, hymes, ambition, backfired, as, the, second, paradigm, marked, a, distancing, of, the, sub, discipline, from, the, rest, of, anthropology, the, third, paradigm, which, began, in, the, late, 1980s, redirected, the, primary, focus, on, anthropology, by, providing, a, linguistic, approach, to, anthropological, issues, rather, than, prioritizing, the, technical, components, of, language, third, paradigm, anthropologists, focus, on, studying, culture, through, the, use, of, linguistic, tools, themes, include, furthermore, similar, to, how, the, second, paradigm, used, new, technology, in, its, studies, the, third, paradigm, heavily, includes, use, of, video, documentation, to, support, research, contemporary, linguistic, anthropology, continues, research, in, all, three, paradigms, described, above, the, third, paradigm, the, study, of, anthropological, issues, through, linguistic, means, is, an, affluent, area, of, study, for, current, linguistic, anthropologists, a, great, deal, of, work, in, linguistic, anthropology, investigates, questions, of, sociocultural, identity, linguistically, and, discursively, linguistic, anthropologist, don, kulick, has, done, so, in, relation, to, identity, for, example, in, a, series, of, settings, first, in, a, village, called, gapun, in, northern, papua, new, guinea, he, explored, how, the, use, of, two, languages, with, and, around, children, in, gapun, village, the, traditional, language, taiap, not, spoken, anywhere, but, in, their, own, village, and, thus, primordially, indexical, of, gapuner, identity, and, tok, pisin, the, widely, circulating, official, language, of, new, guinea, indexical, points, to, meanings, beyond, the, immediate, context, to, speak, the, taiap, language, is, associated, with, one, identity, not, only, local, but, backward, and, also, an, identity, based, on, the, display, of, hed, personal, autonomy, to, speak, tok, pisin, is, to, index, a, modern, catholic, identity, based, not, on, hed, but, on, save, an, identity, linked, with, the, will, and, the, skill, to, cooperate, in, later, work, kulick, demonstrates, that, certain, loud, speech, performances, in, brazil, called, um, esc, ndalo, brazilian, travesti, roughly, transvestite, sex, workers, shame, clients, the, travesti, community, the, argument, goes, ends, up, at, least, making, a, powerful, attempt, to, transcend, the, shame, the, larger, brazilian, public, might, try, to, foist, off, on, them, again, by, loud, public, discourse, and, other, modes, of, performance, in, addition, scholars, such, as, mile, benveniste, mary, bucholtz, and, kira, hall, benjamin, lee, paul, kockelman, and, stanton, wortham, among, many, others, have, contributed, to, understandings, of, identity, as, intersubjectivity, by, examining, the, ways, it, is, discursively, constructed, in, a, series, of, studies, linguistic, anthropologists, elinor, ochs, and, bambi, schieffelin, addressed, the, anthropological, topic, of, socialization, the, process, by, which, infants, children, and, foreigners, become, members, of, a, community, learning, to, participate, in, its, culture, using, linguistic, and, other, ethnographic, methods, they, discovered, that, the, processes, of, enculturation, and, socialization, do, not, occur, apart, from, the, process, of, language, acquisition, but, that, children, acquire, language, and, culture, together, in, what, amounts, to, an, integrated, process, ochs, and, schieffelin, demonstrated, that, baby, talk, is, not, universal, that, the, direction, of, adaptation, whether, the, child, is, made, to, adapt, to, the, ongoing, situation, of, speech, around, it, or, vice, versa, was, a, variable, that, correlated, for, example, with, the, direction, it, was, held, vis, vis, a, caregiver, s, body, in, many, societies, caregivers, hold, a, child, facing, outward, so, as, to, orient, it, to, a, network, of, kin, whom, it, must, learn, to, recognize, early, in, life, ochs, and, schieffelin, demonstrated, that, members, of, all, societies, socialize, children, both, to, and, through, the, use, of, language, ochs, and, schieffelin, uncovered, how, through, naturally, occurring, stories, told, during, dinners, in, white, middle, class, households, in, southern, california, both, mothers, and, fathers, participated, in, replicating, male, dominance, the, father, knows, best, syndrome, by, the, distribution, of, participant, roles, such, as, protagonist, often, a, child, but, sometimes, mother, and, almost, never, the, father, and, problematizer, often, the, father, who, raised, uncomfortable, questions, or, challenged, the, competence, of, the, protagonist, when, mothers, collaborated, with, children, to, get, their, stories, told, they, unwittingly, set, themselves, up, to, be, subject, to, this, process, schieffelin, s, more, recent, research, has, uncovered, the, socializing, role, of, pastors, and, other, fairly, new, bosavi, converts, in, the, southern, highlands, papua, new, guinea, community, she, studies, pastors, have, introduced, new, ways, of, conveying, knowledge, new, linguistic, epistemic, markers, and, new, ways, of, speaking, about, time, and, they, have, struggled, with, and, largely, resisted, those, parts, of, the, bible, that, speak, of, being, able, to, know, the, inner, states, of, others, e, g, the, gospel, of, mark, chapter, 2, verses, 6, 8, in, a, third, example, of, the, current, third, paradigm, since, roman, jakobson, s, student, michael, silverstein, opened, the, way, there, has, been, an, increase, in, the, work, done, by, linguistic, anthropologists, on, the, major, anthropological, theme, of, ideologies, in, this, case, language, ideologies, sometimes, defined, as, shared, bodies, of, commonsense, notions, about, the, nature, of, language, in, the, world, silverstein, has, demonstrated, that, these, ideologies, are, not, mere, false, consciousness, but, actually, influence, the, evolution, of, linguistic, structures, including, the, dropping, of, thee, and, thou, from, everyday, english, usage, woolard, in, her, overview, of, code, switching, or, the, systematic, practice, of, alternating, linguistic, varieties, within, a, conversation, or, even, a, single, utterance, finds, the, underlying, question, anthropologists, ask, of, the, practice, why, do, they, do, that, reflects, a, dominant, linguistic, ideology, it, is, the, ideology, that, people, should, really, be, monoglot, and, efficiently, targeted, toward, referential, clarity, rather, than, diverting, themselves, with, the, messiness, of, multiple, varieties, in, play, at, a, single, time, much, research, on, linguistic, ideologies, probes, subtler, influences, on, language, such, as, the, pull, exerted, on, tewa, a, kiowa, tanoan, language, spoken, in, certain, new, mexican, pueblos, and, on, the, hopi, reservation, in, arizona, by, kiva, speech, discussed, in, the, next, section, other, linguists, have, carried, out, research, in, the, areas, of, language, contact, language, endangerment, and, english, as, a, global, language, for, instance, indian, linguist, braj, kachru, investigated, local, varieties, of, english, in, south, asia, the, ways, in, which, english, functions, as, a, lingua, franca, among, multicultural, groups, in, india, british, linguist, david, crystal, has, contributed, to, investigations, of, language, death, attention, to, the, effects, of, cultural, assimilation, resulting, in, the, spread, of, one, dominant, language, in, situations, of, colonialism, more, recently, a, new, line, of, ideology, work, is, beginning, to, enter, the, field, of, linguistics, in, relation, to, heritage, languages, specifically, applied, linguist, martin, guardado, has, posited, that, heritage, language, ideologies, are, somewhat, fluid, sets, of, understandings, justifications, beliefs, and, judgments, that, linguistic, minorities, hold, about, their, languages, guardado, goes, on, to, argue, that, ideologies, of, heritage, languages, also, contain, the, expectations, and, desires, of, linguistic, minority, families, regarding, the, relevance, of, these, languages, in, their, children, s, lives, as, well, as, when, where, how, and, to, what, ends, these, languages, should, be, used, although, this, is, arguably, a, fledgling, line, of, language, ideology, research, this, work, is, poised, to, contribute, to, the, understanding, of, how, ideologies, of, language, operate, in, a, variety, of, settings, in, a, final, example, of, this, third, paradigm, a, group, of, linguistic, anthropologists, have, done, very, creative, work, on, the, idea, of, social, space, duranti, published, a, groundbreaking, article, on, samoan, greetings, and, their, use, and, transformation, of, social, space, before, that, indonesianist, joseph, errington, making, use, of, earlier, work, by, indonesianists, not, necessarily, concerned, with, language, issues, per, se, brought, linguistic, anthropological, methods, and, semiotic, theory, to, bear, on, the, notion, of, the, exemplary, center, the, center, of, political, and, ritual, power, from, which, emanated, exemplary, behavior, errington, demonstrated, how, the, javanese, priyayi, whose, ancestors, served, at, the, javanese, royal, courts, became, emissaries, so, to, speak, long, after, those, courts, had, ceased, to, exist, representing, throughout, java, the, highest, example, of, refined, speech, the, work, of, joel, kuipers, develops, this, theme, vis, a, vis, the, island, of, sumba, indonesia, and, even, though, it, pertains, to, tewa, indians, in, arizona, rather, than, indonesians, paul, kroskrity, s, argument, that, speech, forms, originating, in, the, tewa, kiva, or, underground, ceremonial, space, forms, the, dominant, model, for, all, tewa, speech, can, be, seen, as, a, direct, parallel, silverstein, tries, to, find, the, maximum, theoretical, significance, and, applicability, in, this, idea, of, exemplary, centers, he, feels, in, fact, that, the, exemplary, center, idea, is, one, of, linguistic, anthropology, s, three, most, important, findings, he, generalizes, the, notion, thus, arguing, there, are, wider, scale, institutional, orders, of, interactionality, historically, contingent, yet, structured, within, such, large, scale, macrosocial, orders, in, effect, ritual, centers, of, semiosis, come, to, exert, a, structuring, value, conferring, influence, on, any, particular, event, of, discursive, interaction, with, respect, to, the, meanings, and, significance, of, the, verbal, and, other, semiotic, forms, used, in, it, current, approaches, to, such, classic, anthropological, topics, as, ritual, by, linguistic, anthropologists, emphasize, not, static, linguistic, structures, but, the, unfolding, in, realtime, of, a, hypertrophic, set, of, parallel, orders, of, iconicity, and, indexicality, that, seem, to, cause, the, ritual, to, create, its, own, sacred, space, through, what, appears, often, to, be, the, magic, of, textual, and, nontextual, metricalizations, synchronized, addressing, the, broad, central, concerns, of, the, subfield, and, drawing, from, its, core, theories, many, scholars, focus, on, the, intersections, of, language, and, the, particularly, salient, social, constructs, of, race, and, ethnicity, class, and, gender, and, sexuality, these, works, generally, consider, the, roles, of, social, structures, e, g, ideologies, and, institutions, related, to, race, class, and, gender, e, g, marriage, labor, pop, culture, education, in, terms, of, their, constructions, and, in, terms, of, individuals, lived, experiences, a, short, list, of, linguistic, anthropological, texts, that, address, these, topics, follows, ethnopoetics, is, a, method, of, recording, text, versions, of, oral, poetry, or, narrative, performances, i, e, verbal, lore, that, uses, poetic, lines, verses, and, stanzas, instead, of, prose, paragraphs, to, capture, the, formal, poetic, performance, elements, which, would, otherwise, be, lost, in, the, written, texts, the, goal, of, any, ethnopoetic, text, is, to, show, how, the, techniques, of, unique, oral, performers, enhance, the, aesthetic, value, of, their, performances, within, their, specific, cultural, contexts, major, contributors, to, ethnopoetic, theory, include, jerome, rothenberg, dennis, tedlock, and, dell, hymes, ethnopoetics, is, considered, a, subfield, of, ethnology, anthropology, folkloristics, stylistics, linguistics, and, literature, and, translation, studies, endangered, languages, are, languages, that, are, not, being, passed, down, to, children, as, their, mother, tongue, or, that, have, declining, numbers, of, speakers, for, a, variety, of, reasons, therefore, after, a, couple, generations, these, languages, may, no, longer, be, spoken, anthropologists, have, been, involved, with, endangered, language, communities, through, their, involvement, in, language, documentation, and, revitalization, projects, in, a, language, documentation, project, researchers, work, to, develop, records, of, the, language, these, records, could, be, field, notes, and, audio, or, video, recordings, to, follow, best, practices, of, documentation, these, records, should, be, clearly, annotated, and, kept, safe, within, an, archive, of, some, kind, franz, boas, was, one, of, the, first, anthropologists, involved, in, language, documentation, within, north, america, and, he, supported, the, development, of, three, key, materials, 1, grammars, 2, texts, and, 3, dictionaries, this, is, now, known, as, the, boasian, trilogy, language, revitalization, is, the, practice, of, bringing, a, language, back, into, common, use, the, revitalization, efforts, can, take, the, form, of, teaching, the, language, to, new, speakers, or, encouraging, the, continued, use, within, the, community, one, example, of, a, language, revitalization, project, is, the, lenape, language, course, taught, at, swathmore, college, pennsylvania, the, course, aims, to, educate, indigenous, and, non, indigenous, students, about, the, lenape, language, and, culture, language, reclamation, as, a, subset, of, revitalization, implies, that, a, language, has, been, taken, away, from, a, community, and, addresses, their, concern, in, taking, back, the, agency, to, revitalize, their, language, on, their, own, terms, language, reclamation, addresses, the, power, dynamics, associated, with, language, loss, encouraging, those, who, already, know, the, language, to, use, it, increasing, the, domains, of, usage, and, increasing, the, overall, prestige, of, the, language, are, all, components, of, reclamation, one, example, of, this, is, the, miami, language, being, brought, back, from, extinct, status, through, extensive, archives, while, the, field, of, linguistics, has, also, been, focused, on, the, study, of, the, linguistic, structures, of, endangered, languages, anthropologists, also, contribute, to, this, field, through, their, emphasize, on, ethnographic, understandings, of, the, socio, historical, context, of, language, endangerment, but, also, of, language, revitalization, and, reclamation, projects, the, jurgen, trabant, wilhelm, von, humboldt, lectures, 7hrs
