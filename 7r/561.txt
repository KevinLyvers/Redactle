the, corpus, juris, or, iuris, civilis, body, of, civil, law, is, the, modern, name, for, a, collection, of, fundamental, works, in, jurisprudence, enacted, from, 529, to, 534, by, order, of, byzantine, emperor, justinian, i, it, is, also, sometimes, referred, to, metonymically, after, one, of, its, parts, the, code, of, justinian, the, work, as, planned, had, three, parts, the, code, codex, is, a, compilation, by, selection, and, extraction, of, imperial, enactments, to, date, the, digest, or, pandects, the, latin, title, contains, both, digesta, and, pandectae, is, an, encyclopedia, composed, of, mostly, brief, extracts, from, the, writings, of, roman, jurists, and, the, institutes, institutiones, is, a, student, textbook, mainly, introducing, the, code, although, it, has, important, conceptual, elements, that, are, less, developed, in, the, code, or, the, digest, all, three, parts, even, the, textbook, were, given, force, of, law, they, were, intended, to, be, together, the, sole, source, of, law, reference, to, any, other, source, including, the, original, texts, from, which, the, code, and, the, digest, had, been, taken, was, forbidden, nonetheless, justinian, found, himself, having, to, enact, further, laws, today, these, are, counted, as, a, fourth, part, of, the, corpus, the, novellae, constitutiones, novels, literally, new, laws, the, work, was, directed, by, tribonian, an, official, in, justinian, s, court, in, constantinople, his, team, was, authorized, to, edit, what, they, included, how, far, they, made, amendments, is, not, recorded, and, in, the, main, cannot, be, known, because, most, of, the, originals, have, not, survived, the, text, was, composed, and, distributed, almost, entirely, in, latin, which, was, still, the, official, language, of, the, government, of, the, eastern, roman, empire, in, 529, 534, whereas, the, prevalent, language, of, merchants, farmers, seamen, and, other, citizens, was, greek, by, the, early, 7th, century, greek, had, largely, replaced, latin, as, the, dominant, language, of, the, empire, the, corpus, juris, civilis, was, revised, into, greek, when, that, became, the, predominant, language, of, the, eastern, roman, empire, and, continued, to, form, the, basis, of, the, empire, s, laws, the, basilika, greek, imperial, laws, through, the, 15th, century, the, basilika, in, turn, served, as, the, basis, for, local, legal, codes, in, the, balkans, during, the, following, ottoman, period, and, later, formed, the, basis, of, the, legal, code, of, modern, greece, in, western, europe, the, corpus, juris, civilis, or, its, successor, texts, like, the, basilika, did, not, get, well, established, originally, and, was, only, recovered, in, the, middle, ages, being, received, or, imitated, as, private, law, its, public, law, content, was, quarried, for, arguments, by, both, secular, and, ecclesiastical, authorities, this, recovered, roman, law, in, turn, became, the, foundation, of, law, in, all, civil, law, jurisdictions, the, provisions, of, the, corpus, juris, civilis, also, influenced, the, canon, law, of, the, catholic, church, it, was, said, that, ecclesia, vivit, lege, romana, the, church, lives, by, roman, law, its, influence, on, common, law, legal, systems, has, been, much, smaller, although, some, basic, concepts, from, the, corpus, have, survived, through, norman, law, such, as, the, contrast, especially, in, the, institutes, between, law, statute, and, custom, the, corpus, continues, to, have, a, major, influence, on, public, international, law, its, four, parts, thus, constitute, the, foundation, documents, of, the, western, legal, tradition, justinian, acceded, to, the, imperial, throne, in, constantinople, in, 527, six, months, after, his, accession, in, order, to, reduce, the, great, number, of, imperial, constitutions, and, thus, also, the, number, of, court, proceedings, justinian, arranged, for, the, creation, of, a, new, collection, of, imperial, constitutions, codex, iustinianus, the, commission, in, charge, of, the, compilation, process, was, explicitly, authorized, to, leave, out, or, change, text, and, to, delete, what, was, obsolete, or, contradictory, soon, in, 529, the, codex, was, completed, and, was, conferred, the, force, of, law, in, the, whole, empire, replacing, all, earlier, constitutions, and, the, codex, theodosianus, a, little, more, than, a, year, after, the, enactment, of, the, first, edition, of, the, code, justinian, appointed, a, commission, headed, by, tribonian, to, compile, the, traditional, jurists, law, in, a, new, shortened, and, contemporary, codification, the, digest, or, pandects, the, traditional, collection, of, jurists, law, justinian, believed, was, so, extensive, that, it, had, become, unmanageable, necessitating, a, new, compilation, the, commission, completed, its, work, within, three, years, in, 533, tribonian, s, commission, surveyed, the, works, of, classical, jurists, who, were, assumed, in, justinian, s, time, to, have, the, authority, to, clarify, law, ius, respondendi, and, whose, works, were, still, available, in, total, there, are, excerpts, from, 38, jurists, in, the, digest, the, codex, justinianus, codex, justinianeus, or, codex, justiniani, latin, for, justinian, s, code, was, the, first, part, to, be, finished, on, 7, april, 529, it, contained, in, latin, most, of, the, existing, imperial, constitutiones, imperial, pronouncements, having, force, of, law, back, to, the, time, of, hadrian, it, used, both, the, codex, theodosianus, and, the, fourth, century, collections, embodied, in, the, codex, gregorianus, and, codex, hermogenianus, which, provided, the, model, for, division, into, books, that, were, themselves, divided, into, titles, these, works, had, developed, authoritative, standing, this, first, edition, is, now, lost, a, second, edition, was, issued, in, 534, and, is, the, text, that, has, survived, at, least, the, second, edition, contained, some, of, justinian, s, own, legislation, including, some, legislation, in, greek, it, is, not, known, whether, he, intended, there, to, be, further, editions, although, he, did, envisage, translation, of, latin, enactments, into, greek, numerous, provisions, served, to, secure, the, status, of, christianity, as, the, state, religion, of, the, empire, uniting, church, and, state, and, making, anyone, who, was, not, connected, to, the, christian, church, a, non, citizen, the, christianity, referred, to, is, chalcedonian, christianity, as, defined, by, the, state, church, which, excluded, a, variety, of, other, major, christian, sects, in, existence, at, the, time, such, as, the, church, of, the, east, and, oriental, orthodoxy, the, very, first, law, in, the, codex, requires, all, persons, under, the, jurisdiction, of, the, empire, to, hold, the, christian, faith, this, was, primarily, aimed, at, heresies, such, as, nestorianism, this, text, later, became, the, springboard, for, discussions, of, international, law, especially, the, question, of, just, what, persons, are, under, the, jurisdiction, of, a, given, state, or, legal, system, other, laws, while, not, aimed, at, pagan, belief, as, such, forbid, particular, pagan, practices, for, example, it, is, provided, that, all, persons, present, at, a, pagan, sacrifice, may, be, indicted, as, if, for, murder, the, digesta, or, pandectae, completed, in, 533, is, a, collection, of, juristic, writings, mostly, dating, back, to, the, second, and, third, centuries, fragments, were, taken, out, of, various, legal, treatises, and, opinions, and, inserted, in, the, digest, in, their, original, context, the, statements, of, the, law, contained, in, these, fragments, were, just, private, opinions, of, legal, scholars, although, some, juristic, writings, had, been, privileged, by, theodosius, ii, s, law, of, citations, in, 426, the, digest, however, was, given, full, force, of, law, as, the, digest, neared, completion, tribonian, and, two, professors, theophilus, and, dorotheus, made, a, student, textbook, called, the, institutions, or, elements, as, there, were, four, elements, the, manual, consists, of, four, books, the, institutiones, are, largely, based, on, the, institutiones, of, gaius, two, thirds, of, the, institutiones, of, justinian, consists, of, literal, quotes, from, gaius, the, new, institutiones, were, used, as, a, manual, for, jurists, in, training, from, 21, november, 533, and, were, given, the, authority, of, law, on, 30, december, 533, along, with, the, digest, the, novellae, consisted, of, new, laws, that, were, passed, after, 534, they, were, later, re, worked, into, the, syntagma, a, practical, lawyer, s, edition, by, athanasios, of, emesa, during, the, years, 572, 577, as, the, administrative, language, of, the, eastern, roman, empire, shifted, away, from, latin, legal, codes, based, on, the, corpus, juris, civilis, were, enacted, in, greek, the, most, well, known, are, the, basilika, was, a, complete, adaptation, of, justinian, s, codification, at, 60, volumes, it, proved, to, be, difficult, for, judges, and, lawyers, to, use, there, was, need, for, a, short, and, handy, version, this, was, finally, made, by, constantine, harmenopoulos, a, byzantine, judge, from, thessaloniki, in, 1345, he, made, a, short, version, of, basilika, in, six, books, called, hexabiblos, this, was, widely, used, throughout, the, balkans, during, the, following, ottoman, period, and, along, with, the, basilika, was, used, as, the, first, legal, code, for, the, newly, independent, greek, state, in, the, 1820s, serbian, state, law, and, culture, was, built, on, the, foundations, of, rome, and, byzantium, therefore, the, most, important, serbian, legal, codes, zakonopravilo, 1219, and, du, an, s, code, 1349, and, 1354, transplanted, romano, byzantine, law, included, in, corpus, juris, civilis, prohiron, and, basilika, these, serbian, codes, were, practised, until, the, serbian, despotate, fell, to, the, turkish, ottoman, empire, in, 1459, after, the, liberation, from, the, turks, in, the, serbian, revolution, serbs, continued, to, practise, roman, law, by, enacting, serbian, civil, code, in, 1844, it, was, a, short, version, of, austrian, civil, code, called, allgemeines, b, rgerliches, gesetzbuch, which, was, made, on, the, basis, of, corpus, juris, civilis, justinian, s, corpus, juris, civilis, was, distributed, in, the, west, and, went, into, effect, in, those, areas, regained, under, justinian, s, wars, of, reconquest, pragmatic, sanction, of, 554, including, the, exarchate, of, ravenna, accordingly, the, institutes, were, made, the, textbook, at, the, law, school, in, rome, and, later, in, ravenna, when, the, school, relocated, there, however, after, the, loss, of, most, of, these, areas, only, the, catepanate, southern, italy, maintained, a, byzantine, legal, tradition, but, there, the, corpus, was, superseded, by, the, ecloga, and, basilika, only, the, corpus, s, provisions, regulating, the, church, still, had, any, effect, but, the, catholic, church, s, de, facto, autonomy, and, the, great, schism, made, even, that, irrelevant, in, western, europe, the, corpus, may, have, spurred, a, slew, of, romano, germanic, law, codes, in, the, successor, germanic, kingdoms, but, these, were, heavily, based, on, the, older, theodosian, code, not, the, corpus, historians, disagree, on, the, precise, way, the, corpus, was, recovered, in, northern, italy, about, 1070, legal, studies, were, undertaken, on, behalf, of, papal, authority, central, to, the, gregorian, reform, of, pope, gregory, vii, which, may, have, led, to, its, accidental, rediscovery, aside, from, the, littera, florentina, a, complete, 6th, century, copy, of, the, digest, preserved, in, amalfi, and, later, moved, to, pisa, and, the, epitome, codicis, c, 1050, incomplete, manuscript, preserving, most, of, the, codex, there, may, have, been, other, manuscript, sources, for, the, text, that, began, to, be, taught, at, bologna, by, pepo, and, then, by, irnerius, irnerius, technique, was, to, read, a, passage, aloud, which, permitted, his, students, to, copy, it, then, to, deliver, an, excursus, explaining, and, illuminating, justinian, s, text, in, the, form, of, glosses, irnerius, pupils, the, so, called, four, doctors, of, bologna, were, among, the, first, of, the, glossators, who, established, the, curriculum, of, medieval, roman, law, the, tradition, was, carried, on, by, french, lawyers, known, as, the, ultramontani, in, the, 13th, century, the, merchant, classes, of, italian, communes, required, law, with, a, concept, of, equity, and, law, that, covered, situations, inherent, in, urban, life, better, than, the, primitive, germanic, oral, traditions, the, provenance, of, the, code, appealed, to, scholars, who, saw, in, the, holy, roman, empire, a, revival, of, venerable, precedents, from, the, classical, heritage, the, new, class, of, lawyers, staffed, the, bureaucracies, that, were, beginning, to, be, required, by, the, princes, of, europe, the, university, of, bologna, where, justinian, s, code, was, first, taught, remained, the, dominant, centre, for, the, study, of, law, through, the, high, middle, ages, a, two, volume, edition, of, the, digest, was, published, in, paris, in, 1549, and, 1550, translated, by, antonio, agust, n, bishop, of, tarragona, who, was, well, known, for, other, legal, works, the, full, title, of, the, digest, was, digestorum, seu, pandectarum, tomus, alter, and, it, was, published, by, carolus, guillardus, vol, 1, of, the, digest, has, 2934, pages, while, vol, 2, has, 2754, pages, referring, to, justinian, s, code, as, corpus, juris, civilis, was, only, adopted, in, the, 16th, century, when, it, was, printed, in, 1583, by, dionysius, gothofredus, under, this, title, the, legal, thinking, behind, the, corpus, juris, civilis, served, as, the, backbone, of, the, single, largest, legal, reform, of, the, modern, age, the, napoleonic, code, which, marked, the, abolition, of, feudalism, but, reinstated, slavery, in, the, french, caribbean, napoleon, as, he, waged, total, war, on, europe, wanted, to, see, these, principles, introduced, to, the, whole, of, europe, because, he, saw, them, as, an, effective, form, of, rule, that, created, a, more, equal, society, and, thus, creating, a, more, friendly, relationship, between, the, ruling, class, and, the, rest, of, the, peoples, of, europe, the, corpus, juris, civilis, was, translated, into, french, german, italian, and, spanish, in, the, 19th, century, however, no, english, translation, of, the, entire, corpus, juris, civilis, existed, until, 1932, when, samuel, parsons, scott, published, his, version, the, civil, law, scott, did, not, base, his, translation, on, the, best, available, latin, versions, and, his, work, was, severely, criticized, fred, h, blume, used, the, best, regarded, latin, editions, for, his, translations, of, the, code, and, of, the, novels, a, new, english, translation, of, the, code, based, on, blume, s, was, published, in, october, 2016, in, 2018, the, cambridge, university, press, also, published, a, new, english, translation, of, the, novels, based, primarily, on, the,
