as, medieval, punjabi, the, arabic, and, modern, persian, influence, in, the, historical, punjab, region, began, with, the, late, first, millennium, muslim, conquests, in, the, indian, subcontinent, many, persian, and, arabic, words, have, been, incorporated, into, punjabi, so, punjabi, relies, heavily, on, persian, and, arabic, words, which, are, used, with, a, liberal, approach, to, language, many, important, words, like, etc, are, derived, from, persian, and, arabic, after, the, fall, of, the, sikh, empire, urdu, was, made, the, official, language, of, punjab, in, pakistani, punjab, it,

portuguese, words, like, greek, words, like, chagatai, words, like, japanese, words, like, chinese, words, like, and, english, words, like, though, these, influences, have, been, minor, in, comparison, to, persian, and, arabic, note, in, more, formal, contexts, hypercorrect, sanskritized, versions, of, these, words, pradh, n, for, pardh, n, and, pariv, r, for, parv, r, may, be, used,

which, have, many, dialects, and, forms, altogether, spoken, by, over, 150, million, people, the, majhi, dialect, which, is, transitional, between, the, two, main, varieties, has, been, adopted, as, standard, punjabi, in, india, and, pakistan, for, education, and, mass, media, the, majhi, dialect, originated, in, the, majha, region, of, the, punjab, in, india, punjabi, is, written, in, the, gurmukh, script, in, offices, schools, and, media, gurmukhi, is, the, official, standard, script, for, punjabi, though, it, is, often, unofficially, written, in, the, latin, scripts, due, to, influence, from, english, one, of, india, s, two, primary, official, languages, at, the, union, level, in, pakistan, punjabi, is, generally, written, using, the, shahmukh, script, which, in, literary, standards, is, identical, to, the, urdu, alphabet, however, various, attempts, have, been, made, to, create, certain, distinct, characters, from, a, modification, of, the, persian, nasta, l, q, characters, to, represent, punjabi, phonology, not, already, found, in, the, urdu, alphabet, in, pakistan, punjabi, loans, technical, words, from, persian, and, arabic, just, like, urdu, does,

the, native, language, of, 88, 9, million, people, or, approximately, 37, of, the, country, s, population, beginning, with, the, 1981, and, 2017, censuses, respectively, speakers, of, the, western, punjabi, s, saraiki, and, hindko, varieties, were, no, longer, included, in, the, total, numbers, for, punjabi, which, explains, the, apparent, decrease, pothwari, speakers, however, are, included, in, the, total, numbers, for, punjabi, punjabi, is, the, official, language, of, the, indian, state, of, punjab, and, has, the, status, of, an, additional, official, language, in, haryana, and, delhi, some, of, its, major, urban, centres, in, northern, india, are, amritsar, ludhiana, chandigarh, jalandhar, ambala, patiala, bathinda, hoshiarpur, firozpur, and, delhi, in, the, 2011, census, of,

figure, of, 33, 12, million, punjabi, is, also, spoken, as, a, minority, language, in, several, other, countries, where, punjabi, people, have, emigrated, in, large, numbers, such, as, the, united, states, australia, the, united, kingdom, and, canada, there, were, 670, 000, native, punjabi, speakers, in, canada, in, 2021, 300, 000, in, the, united, kingdom, in, 2011, 280, 000, in, the, united, states, and, smaller, numbers, in, other, countries, standard, punjabi, sometimes, referred, to, as, majhi, in, india, or, simply, central, eastern, punjabi, is, the, most, widespread, and, largest, dialect, of, punjabi, it, is, transitional, between, both, western, punjabi, lahnda, punjab, and, eastern, punjabi, charda, punjab, and, it, first, developed, in, the, 12th, century, and, gained, prominence, when, sufi, poets, such, as, shah, hussain, bulleh, shah, among, others, began, to, use, the, lahore, amritsar, spoken, dialect, with, infused, persian, vocabulary, in, their, works, in, the, shahmukhi, script, later, the, gurmukhi, script, was, developed, based, on, standard, punjabi, by, the, sikh, gurus, in, pakistan, the, standard, punjabi, dialect, is, not, referred, to, as, the, majhi, dialect, which, may, be, considered, as, indian, terminology, rather, simply, as, standard, punjabi, this, dialect, is, widely, used, in, the, tv, and, entertainment, industry, which, is, mainly, produced, in, lahore, the, punjabi, variety, predominantly, spoken, in, the, indian, punjab, and, also, by, partition, migrants, and, their, descendants, in, pakistan, is, known, as, eastern, punjabi, it, includes, dialects, like, malwai, doabi, puadhi, and, extinct, lubanki, the, diverse, group, of, punjabi, varieties, spoken, in, the, western, areas, of, pakistani, punjab, as, well, as, in, neighbouring, hazara, region, and, parts, of, azad, kashmir, is, known, as, western, punjabi, or, lahnda, lit, western, these, include, groups, of, dialects, like, saraiki, pahari, pothwari, hindko, and, extinct, inku, common, dialects, like, jhangvi, dhanni, and, thali, which, are, usually, grouped, under, the, term, jatki, punjabi, and, the, mixed, variety, of, punjabi, and, sindhi, called, khetrani, while, a, vowel, length, distinction, between, short, and, long, vowels, exists, reflected, in, modern, gurmukhi, orthographical, conventions, it, is, secondary, to, the, vowel, quality, contrast, between, centralised, vowels, and, peripheral, vowels, i, e, a, o, u, in, terms, of, phonetic, significance, the, peripheral, vowels, have, nasal, analogues, there, is, a, tendency, with, speakers, to, insert, between, adjacent, a, vowels, as, a, separator, when, the, latter, vowel, is, low, tone, this, usually, changes, to, note, for, the, tonal, stops, refer, to, the, next, section, about, tone, the, three, retroflex, consonants, do, not, occur, initially, and, the, nasals, most, commonly, occur, as, allophones, of, n, in, clusters, with, velars, and, palatals, there, are, few, exceptions, the, well, established, phoneme, may, be, realised, allophonically, as, the, voiceless, retroflex, fricative, in, learned, clusters, with, retroflexes, due, to, its, foreign, origin, it, is, often, also, realised, as, in, e, g, shalw, r, sal, a, the, phonemic, status, of, the, consonants, f, z, x, q, varies, with, familiarity, with, hindustani, norms, more, so, with, the, gurmukhi, script, with, the, pairs, f, p, z, d, x, k, g, and, q, k, systematically, distinguished, in, educated, speech, q, being, the, most, rarely, pronounced, the, retroflex, lateral, is, most, commonly, analysed, as, an, approximant, as, opposed, to, a, flap, some, speakers, soften, the, voiceless, aspirates, t, p, k, into, fricatives, f, x, respectively, in, rare, cases, the, and, phonemes, in, shahmukhi, may, be, represented, with, letters, from, sindhi, the, phoneme, which, is, more, common, than, is, written, as, or, depending, on, its, phonetic, preservation, e, g, a, a, preserved, as, opposed, to, ki, d, assimilated, into, nj, is, always, written, as, like, hindustani, the, diphthongs, and, have, mostly, disappeared, but, are, still, retained, in, some, dialects, phonotactically, long, vowels, a, i, u, are, treated, as, doubles, of, their, short, vowel, counterparts, rather, than, separate, phonemes, hence, diphthongs, like, ai, and, au, get, monophthongised, into, e, and, o, and, i, and, u, into, and, respectively, the, phoneme, j, is, very, fluid, in, punjabi, j, is, only, truly, pronounced, word, initially, even, then, it, often, becomes, d, where, it, is, otherwise, or, i, unusually, for, an, indo, aryan, language, punjabi, distinguishes, lexical, tones, three, tones, are, distinguished, in, punjabi, some, sources, have, described, these, as, tone, contours, given, in, parentheses, low, high, falling, high, low, rising, and, level, neutral, or, middle, the, transcriptions, and, tone, annotations, in, the, examples, below, are, based, on, those, provided, in, punjabi, university, patiala, s, punjabi, english, dictionary, level, tone, is, found, in, about, 75, of, words, and, is, described, by, some, as, absence, of, tone, there, are, also, some, words, which, are, said, to, have, rising, tone, in, the, first, syllable, and, falling, in, the, second, some, writers, describe, this, as, a, fourth, tone, however, a, recent, acoustic, study, of, six, punjabi, speakers, in, the, united, states, found, no, evidence, of, a, separate, falling, tone, following, a, medial, consonant, it, is, considered, that, these, tones, arose, when, voiced, aspirated, consonants, gh, jh, h, dh, bh, lost, their, aspiration, at, the, beginning, of, a, word, they, became, voiceless, unaspirated, consonants, k, c, t, p, followed, by, a, high, falling, tone, medially, or, finally, they, became, voiced, unaspirated, consonants, g, j, d, b, preceded, by, a, low, rising, tone, the, development, of, a, high, falling, tone, apparently, did, not, take, place, in, every, word, but, only, in, those, which, historically, had, a, long, vowel, the, presence, of, an, although, the, is, now, silent, or, very, weakly, pronounced, except, word, initially, word, finally, and, sometimes, medially, often, causes, a, rising, tone, before, it, for, example, c, h, tea, the, gurmukhi, script, which, was, developed, in, the, 16th, century, has, separate, letters, for, voiced, aspirated, sounds, so, it, is, thought, that, the, change, in, pronunciation, of, the, consonants, and, development, of, tones, may, have, taken, place, since, that, time, some, other, languages, in, pakistan, have, also, been, found, to, have, tonal, distinctions, including, burushaski, gujari, hindko, kalami, shina, and, torwali, though, these, seem, to, be, independent, of, punjabi, gemination, of, a, consonant, doubling, the, letter, is, indicated, with, adhak, in, gurmukhi, and, tashd, d, in, shahmukhi, its, inscription, with, a, unique, diacritic, is, a, distinct, feature, of, gurmukhi, compared, to, brahmic, scripts, all, consonants, except, six, h, r, v, y, are, regularly, geminated, the, latter, four, are, only, geminated, in, loan, words, from, other, languages, there, is, a, tendency, to, irregularly, geminate, consonants, which, follow, long, vowels, except, in, the, final, syllable, of, a, word, e, g, men, menn, it, also, causes, the, long, vowels, to, shorten, but, remain, peripheral, distinguishing, them, from, the, central, vowels, this, gemination, is, less, prominent, than, the, literarily, regular, gemination, represented, by, the, diacritics, mentioned, above, before, a, non, final, prenasalised, consonant, long, vowels, undergo, the, same, change, but, no, gemination, occurs, the, true, gemination, of, a, consonant, after, a, long, vowel, is, unheard, of, but, is, written, in, some, english, loanwords, to, indicate, short, and, e, g, dead, punjabi, has, a, canonical, word, order, of, sov, subject, object, verb, function, words, are, largely, postpositions, marking, grammatical, case, on, a, preceding, nominal, punjabi, distinguishes, two, genders, two, numbers, and, six, cases, direct, oblique, vocative, ablative, locative, and, instrumental, the, ablative, occurs, only, in, the, singular, in, free, variation, with, oblique, case, plus, ablative, postposition, and, the, locative, and, instrumental, are, usually, confined, to, set, adverbial, expressions, adjectives, when, declinable, are, marked, for, the, gender, number, and, case, of, the, nouns, they, qualify, there, is, also, a, t, v, distinction, upon, the, inflectional, case, is, built, a, system, of, particles, known, as, postpositions, which, parallel, english, s, prepositions, it, is, their, use, with, a, noun, or, verb, that, is, what, necessitates, the, noun, or, verb, taking, the, oblique, case, and, it, is, with, them, that, the, locus, of, grammatical, function, or, case, marking, then, lies, the, punjabi, verbal, system, is, largely, structured, around, a, combination, of, aspect, and, tense, mood, like, the, nominal, system, the, punjabi, verb, takes, a, single, inflectional, suffix, and, is, often, followed, by, successive, layers, of, elements, like, auxiliary, verbs, and, postpositions, to, the, right, of, the, lexical, base, being, an, indo, aryan, language, the, core, vocabulary, of, punjabi, consists, of, tadbhav, words, inherited, from, sanskrit, it, contains, many, loanwords, from, persian, and, arabic, the, punjabi, language, is, written, in, multiple, scripts, a, phenomenon, known, as, synchronic, digraphia, each, of, the, major, scripts, currently, in, use, is, typically, associated, with, a, particular, religious, group, although, the, association, is, not, absolute, or, exclusive, in, india, punjabi, sikhs, use, gurmukhi, a, script, of, the, brahmic, family, which, has, official, status, in, the, state, of, punjab, in, pakistan, punjabi, muslims, use, shahmukhi, a, variant, of, the, perso, arabic, script, and, closely, related, to, the, urdu, alphabet, sometimes, punjabi, is, recorded, in, the, devanagari, script, in, india, albeit, rarely, the, punjabi, hindus, in, india, had, a, preference, for, devanagari, another, brahmic, script, also, used, for, hindi, and, in, the, first, decades, since, independence, raised, objections, to, the, uniform, adoption, of, gurmukhi, in, the, state, of, punjab, but, most, have, now, switched, to, gurmukhi, and, so, the, use, of, devanagari, is, rare, often, in, literature, pakistani, punjabi, written, in, shahmukhi, is, referred, as, western, punjabi, or, west, punjabi, and, indian, punjabi, written, in, gurmukhi, is, referred, as, eastern, punjabi, or, east, punjabi, although, the, underlying, language, is, the, same, with, a, very, slight, shift, in, vocabulary, towards, islamic, and, sikh, words, respectively, the, written, standard, for, shahmukhi, also, slightly, differs, from, that, of, gurmukhi, as, it, is, used, for, western, dialects, whereas, gurumukhi, is, used, to, write, eastern, dialects, historically, various, local, brahmic, scripts, including, la, and, its, descendants, were, also, in, use, the, punjabi, braille, is, used, by, the, visually, impaired, there, is, an, altered, version, of, iast, often, used, for, punjabi, in, which, the, diphthongs, ai, and, au, are, written, as, e, and,
