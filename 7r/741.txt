guilt, is, a, moral, emotion, that, occurs, when, a, person, believes, or, realizes, accurately, or, not, that, they, have, compromised, their, own, standards, of, conduct, or, have, violated, universal, moral, standards, and, bear, significant, responsibility, for, that, violation, guilt, is, closely, related, to, the, concept, of, remorse, regret, as, well, as, shame, guilt, is, an, important, factor, in, perpetuating, obsessive, compulsive, disorder, symptoms, the, etymology, of, the, word, is, obscure, and, developed, its, modern, spelling, from, the, old, english, form, gylt, crime, sin, fault, fine, debt, which, is, possibly, derived, from, old, english, gieldan, to, pay, for, debt, because, it, was, used, in, the, lord, s, prayer, as, the, translation, for, the, latin, debitum, and, also, in, matthew, xviii, 27, and, gylti, is, used, to, render, debet, in, matthew, xxiii, 18, it, has, been, inferred, to, have, had, the, primary, sense, of, debt, though, there, is, no, real, evidence, for, this, its, development, into, a, sense, of, guilt, is, first, recorded, in, 1690, as, a, misuse, of, its, original, meaning, guilt, by, association, is, first, recorded, in, 1941, guilty, is, similarly, from, old, english, gyltig, itself, from, gylt, guilt, and, its, associated, causes, advantages, and, disadvantages, are, common, themes, in, psychology, and, psychiatry, both, in, specialized, and, in, ordinary, language, guilt, is, an, affective, state, in, which, one, experiences, conflict, at, having, done, something, that, one, believes, one, should, not, have, done, or, conversely, having, not, done, something, one, believes, one, should, have, done, it, gives, rise, to, a, feeling, which, does, not, go, away, easily, driven, by, conscience, sigmund, freud, described, this, as, the, result, of, a, struggle, between, the, ego, and, the, superego, parental, imprinting, freud, rejected, the, role, of, god, as, punisher, in, times, of, illness, or, rewarder, in, time, of, wellness, while, removing, one, source, of, guilt, from, patients, he, described, another, this, was, the, unconscious, force, within, the, individual, that, contributed, to, illness, freud, in, fact, coming, to, consider, the, obstacle, of, an, unconscious, sense, of, guilt, as, the, most, powerful, of, all, obstacles, to, recovery, for, his, later, explicator, jacques, lacan, guilt, was, the, inevitable, companion, of, the, signifying, subject, who, acknowledged, normality, in, the, form, of, the, symbolic, order, alice, miller, claims, that, many, people, suffer, all, their, lives, from, this, oppressive, feeling, of, guilt, the, sense, of, not, having, lived, up, to, their, parents, expectations, no, argument, can, overcome, these, guilt, feelings, for, they, have, their, beginnings, in, life, s, earliest, period, and, from, that, they, derive, their, intensity, this, may, be, linked, to, what, les, parrott, has, called, the, disease, of, false, guilt, at, the, root, of, false, guilt, is, the, idea, that, what, you, feel, must, be, true, therapists, recognized, similar, feelings, of, guilt, in, individuals, that, survived, traumatic, events, that, involved, a, loved, one, perishing, called, survivor, s, guilt, the, philosopher, martin, buber, underlined, the, difference, between, the, freudian, notion, of, guilt, based, on, internal, conflicts, and, existential, guilt, based, on, actual, harm, done, to, others, guilt, is, often, associated, with, anxiety, in, mania, according, to, otto, fenichel, the, patient, succeeds, in, applying, to, guilt, the, defense, mechanism, of, denial, by, overcompensation, re, enacts, being, a, person, without, guilt, feelings, in, psychological, research, guilt, can, be, measured, by, using, questionnaires, such, as, the, differential, emotions, scale, izard, s, des, or, the, dutch, guilt, measurement, instrument, according, to, psychoanalytic, theory, defenses, against, feeling, guilt, can, become, an, overriding, aspect, of, one, s, personality, the, methods, that, can, be, used, to, avoid, guilt, are, multiple, they, include, guilt, proneness, is, reliably, associated, with, moral, character, similarly, feelings, of, guilt, can, prompt, subsequent, virtuous, behavior, people, who, feel, guilty, may, be, more, likely, to, exercise, restraint, avoid, self, indulgence, and, exhibit, less, prejudice, guilt, appears, to, prompt, reparatory, behaviors, to, alleviate, the, negative, emotions, that, it, engenders, people, appear, to, engage, in, targeted, and, specific, reparatory, behaviors, toward, the, persons, they, wronged, or, offended, individuals, high, in, psychopathy, lack, any, true, sense, of, guilt, or, remorse, for, harm, they, may, have, caused, others, instead, they, rationalize, their, behavior, blame, someone, else, or, deny, it, outright, people, with, psychopathy, have, a, tendency, to, be, harmful, to, themselves, and, to, others, they, have, little, ability, to, plan, ahead, for, the, future, an, individual, with, psychopathy, will, never, find, themselves, at, fault, because, they, will, do, whatever, it, takes, to, benefit, themselves, without, reservation, a, person, that, does, not, feel, guilt, or, remorse, would, have, no, reason, to, find, themselves, at, fault, for, something, that, they, did, with, the, intention, of, hurting, another, person, to, a, person, high, in, psychopathy, their, actions, can, always, be, rationalized, to, be, the, fault, of, another, person, this, is, seen, by, psychologists, as, part, of, a, lack, of, moral, reasoning, in, comparison, with, the, majority, of, humans, an, inability, to, evaluate, situations, in, a, moral, framework, and, an, inability, to, develop, emotional, bonds, with, other, people, due, to, a, lack, of, empathy, one, study, on, psychopaths, found, that, under, certain, circumstances, they, could, willfully, empathize, with, others, and, that, their, empathic, reaction, initiated, the, same, way, it, does, for, controls, psychopathic, criminals, were, brain, scanned, while, watching, videos, of, a, person, harming, another, individual, the, psychopaths, empathic, reaction, initiated, the, same, way, it, did, for, controls, when, they, were, instructed, to, empathize, with, the, harmed, individual, and, the, area, of, the, brain, relating, to, pain, was, activated, when, the, psychopaths, were, asked, to, imagine, how, the, harmed, individual, felt, the, research, suggests, psychopaths, can, switch, empathy, on, at, will, which, would, enable, them, to, be, both, callous, and, charming, the, team, who, conducted, the, study, say, they, do, not, know, how, to, transform, this, willful, empathy, into, the, spontaneous, empathy, most, people, have, though, they, propose, it, might, be, possible, to, rehabilitate, psychopaths, by, helping, them, to, activate, their, empathy, switch, others, suggested, that, it, remains, unclear, whether, psychopaths, experience, of, empathy, was, the, same, as, that, of, controls, and, also, questioned, the, possibility, of, devising, therapeutic, interventions, that, would, make, the, empathic, reactions, more, automatic, neuroscientist, antonio, r, damasio, and, his, colleagues, showed, that, subjects, with, damage, to, the, ventromedial, prefrontal, cortex, lack, the, ability, to, empathically, feel, their, way, to, moral, answers, and, that, when, confronted, with, moral, dilemmas, these, brain, damaged, patients, coldly, came, up, with, end, justifies, the, means, answers, leading, damasio, to, conclude, that, the, point, was, not, that, they, reached, immoral, conclusions, but, that, when, they, were, confronted, by, a, difficult, issue, in, this, case, as, whether, to, shoot, down, a, passenger, plane, hijacked, by, terrorists, before, it, hits, a, major, city, these, patients, appear, to, reach, decisions, without, the, anguish, that, afflicts, those, with, normally, functioning, brains, according, to, adrian, raine, a, clinical, neuroscientist, also, at, the, university, of, southern, california, one, of, this, study, s, implications, is, that, society, may, have, to, rethink, how, it, judges, immoral, people, psychopaths, often, feel, no, empathy, or, remorse, without, that, awareness, people, relying, exclusively, on, reasoning, seem, to, find, it, harder, to, sort, their, way, through, moral, thickets, does, that, mean, they, should, be, held, to, different, standards, of, accountability, some, evolutionary, psychologists, theorize, that, guilt, and, shame, helped, maintain, beneficial, relationships, such, as, reciprocal, altruism, if, a, person, feels, guilty, when, he, harms, another, or, fails, to, reciprocate, kindness, he, is, more, likely, not, to, harm, others, or, become, too, selfish, in, this, way, he, reduces, the, chances, of, retaliation, by, members, of, his, tribe, and, thereby, increases, his, survival, prospects, and, those, of, the, tribe, or, group, as, with, any, other, emotion, guilt, can, be, manipulated, to, control, or, influence, others, as, highly, social, animals, living, in, large, relatively, stable, groups, humans, need, ways, to, deal, with, conflicts, and, events, in, which, they, inadvertently, or, purposefully, harm, others, if, someone, causes, harm, to, another, and, then, feels, guilt, and, demonstrates, regret, and, sorrow, the, person, harmed, is, likely, to, forgive, thus, guilt, makes, it, possible, to, forgive, and, helps, hold, the, social, group, together, collective, guilt, or, group, guilt, is, the, unpleasant, and, often, emotional, reaction, that, results, among, a, group, of, individuals, when, it, is, perceived, that, the, group, illegitimately, harmed, members, of, another, group, it, is, often, the, result, of, sharing, a, social, identity, with, others, whose, actions, represent, a, threat, to, the, positivity, of, that, identity, for, an, individual, to, experience, collective, guilt, he, must, identify, himself, as, a, part, of, the, in, group, this, produces, a, perceptual, shift, from, thinking, of, oneself, in, terms, of, i, and, me, to, us, or, we, guilt, and, shame, are, two, closely, related, concepts, but, they, have, key, differences, that, should, not, be, overlooked, cultural, anthropologist, ruth, benedict, describes, shame, as, the, result, of, a, violation, of, cultural, or, social, values, while, guilt, is, conjured, up, internally, when, one, s, personal, morals, are, violated, to, put, it, more, simply, the, primary, difference, between, shame, and, guilt, is, the, source, that, creates, the, emotion, shame, arises, from, a, real, or, imagined, negative, perception, coming, from, others, and, guilt, arises, from, a, negative, perception, of, one, s, own, thoughts, or, actions, psychoanalyst, helen, block, lewis, stated, that, the, experience, of, shame, is, directly, about, the, self, which, is, the, focus, of, evaluation, in, guilt, the, self, is, not, the, central, object, of, negative, evaluation, but, rather, the, thing, done, is, the, focus, an, individual, can, still, possess, a, positive, perception, of, themselves, while, also, feeling, guilt, for, certain, actions, or, thoughts, they, took, part, in, contrary, to, guilt, shame, has, a, more, inclusive, focus, on, the, individual, as, a, whole, fossum, and, mason, s, ideas, clearly, outline, this, idea, in, their, book, facing, shame, they, state, that, while, guilt, is, a, painful, feeling, of, regret, and, responsibility, for, one, s, actions, shame, is, a, painful, feeling, about, oneself, as, a, person, shame, can, almost, be, described, as, looking, at, yourself, unfavorably, through, the, eyes, of, others, psychiatrist, judith, lewis, herman, portrays, this, idea, by, stating, that, shame, is, an, acutely, self, conscious, state, in, which, the, self, is, split, imagining, the, self, in, the, eyes, of, the, other, by, contrast, in, guilt, the, self, is, unified, both, shame, and, guilt, are, directly, related, to, self, perception, only, shame, causes, the, individual, to, account, for, the, cultural, and, social, beliefs, of, others, paul, gilbert, talks, about, the, powerful, hold, that, shame, can, take, over, someone, in, his, article, evolution, social, roles, and, the, differences, in, shame, and, guilt, he, says, that, the, fear, of, shame, and, ridicule, can, be, so, strong, that, people, will, risk, serious, physical, injury, or, even, death, to, avoid, it, one, of, the, reasons, for, this, is, because, shame, can, indicate, serious, damage, to, social, acceptance, and, a, breakdown, in, a, variety, of, social, relationships, the, evolutionary, root, of, shame, is, in, a, self, focused, social, threat, system, related, to, competitive, behavior, and, the, need, to, prove, oneself, acceptable, desirable, to, others, guilt, on, the, other, hand, evolved, from, a, place, of, care, giving, and, avoidance, of, any, act, that, harms, others, traditional, japanese, society, korean, society, and, chinese, culture, are, sometimes, said, to, be, shame, based, rather, than, guilt, based, in, that, the, social, consequences, of, getting, caught, are, seen, as, more, important, than, the, individual, feelings, or, experiences, of, the, agent, see, the, work, of, ruth, benedict, the, same, has, been, said, of, ancient, greek, society, a, culture, where, in, bruno, snell, s, words, if, honour, is, destroyed, the, moral, existence, of, the, loser, collapses, this, may, lead, to, more, of, a, focus, on, etiquette, than, on, ethics, as, understood, in, western, civilization, leading, some, in, western, civilizations, to, question, why, the, word, ethos, was, adapted, from, ancient, greek, with, such, vast, differences, in, cultural, norms, christianity, and, islam, inherit, most, notions, of, guilt, from, judaism, persian, and, roman, ideas, mostly, as, interpreted, through, augustine, who, adapted, plato, s, ideas, to, christianity, the, latin, word, for, guilt, is, culpa, a, word, sometimes, seen, in, law, literature, for, instance, in, mea, culpa, meaning, my, fault, guilt, guilt, is, a, main, theme, in, john, steinbeck, s, east, of, eden, fyodor, dostoyevsky, s, crime, and, punishment, tennessee, williams, a, streetcar, named, desire, william, shakespeare, s, play, macbeth, edgar, allan, poe, s, the, tell, tale, heart, and, the, black, cat, and, many, other, works, of, literature, in, sartre, s, the, flies, the, furies, in, the, form, of, flies, represent, the, morbid, strangling, forces, of, neurotic, guilt, which, bind, us, to, authoritarian, and, totalitarian, power, guilt, is, a, major, theme, in, many, works, by, nathaniel, hawthorne, and, is, an, almost, universal, concern, of, novelists, who, explore, inner, life, and, secrets, in, his, kyriai, doxai, principal, doctrines, 17, and, 35, epicurus, teaches, that, we, may, identify, and, diagnose, guilt, by, its, signs, and, perturbations, within, his, ethical, system, based, on, pleasure, and, pain, guilt, manifests, as, constant, fear, of, detection, that, emerges, from, secretly, doing, something, contrary, to, an, agreement, to, not, harm, one, another, or, be, harmed, since, epicurus, rejects, supernatural, claims, the, easiest, way, to, avoid, this, perturbation, is, to, avoid, the, antisocial, behavior, in, order, to, continue, enjoying, ataraxia, the, state, of, no, perturbation, however, once, guilt, is, unavoidable, epicurean, guides, recommended, confession, of, one, s, offenses, as, a, practice, that, helps, to, purge, the, character, from, its, evil, tendencies, and, reform, the, character, according, to, norman, dewitt, author, of, st, paul, and, epicurus, confession, was, one, of, the, epicurean, practices, that, was, later, appropriated, by, the, early, christian, communities, guilt, in, the, christian, bible, is, not, merely, an, emotional, state, it, is, also, a, legal, state, of, deserving, punishment, the, hebrew, bible, does, not, have, a, unique, word, for, guilt, but, uses, a, single, word, to, signify, sin, the, guilt, of, it, the, punishment, due, unto, it, and, a, sacrifice, for, it, the, greek, new, testament, uses, a, word, for, guilt, that, means, standing, exposed, to, judgment, for, sin, e, g, romans, 3, 19, in, what, christians, call, the, old, testament, christians, believe, the, bible, teaches, that, through, sacrifice, one, s, sins, can, be, forgiven, judaism, categorically, rejects, this, idea, holding, that, forgiveness, of, sin, is, exclusively, through, repentance, and, the, role, of, sacrifices, was, for, atonement, of, sins, committed, by, accident, or, ignorance, the, new, testament, says, that, forgiveness, is, given, as, written, in, 1, corinthians, 15, 3, 4, 3, for, what, i, received, i, passed, on, to, you, as, of, first, importance, that, christ, died, for, our, sins, according, to, the, scriptures, for, that, he, was, buried, that, he, was, raised, on, the, third, day, according, to, the, scriptures, in, both, the, old, testament, and, the, new, testament, salvation, is, granted, based, on, god, s, grace, and, forgiveness, gen, 6, 8, 19, 19, exo, 33, 12, 17, 34, 6, 7, the, new, testament, says, that, in, jesus, christ, god, took, upon, himself, the, sins, of, the, world, and, died, on, the, cross, to, pay, mankind, s, debt, rom, 6, 23, those, who, repent, and, accept, christ, s, sacrifice, for, their, sins, will, be, redeemed, by, god, and, thus, not, guilty, before, him, they, will, be, granted, eternal, life, which, will, take, effect, after, the, second, coming, of, christ, 1, thess, 4, 13, 18, the, bible, agrees, with, pagan, cultures, that, guilt, creates, a, cost, that, someone, must, pay, heb, 9, 22, this, assumption, was, expressed, in, the, previous, section, defences, guilty, people, punish, themselves, if, they, have, no, opportunity, to, compensate, the, transgression, that, caused, them, to, feel, guilty, it, was, found, that, self, punishment, did, not, occur, if, people, had, an, opportunity, to, compensate, the, victim, of, their, transgression, unlike, pagan, deities, who, demanded, that, debts, for, sin, be, paid, by, humans, god, according, to, the, bible, loved, humanity, enough, to, pay, it, himself, mat, 5, 45
