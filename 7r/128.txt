states, and, canada, studies, have, typically, found, that, walmart, s, prices, are, significantly, lower, than, those, of, their, competitors, and, that, walmart, s, presence, is, associated, with, lower, food, prices, for, households, comparisons, of, performance, metrics, such, as, sales, per, square, foot, suggest, that, supermarkets, in, direct, competition, with, walmart, supercenters, show, significant, decreases, in, profit, margins, an, effect, that, is, strongest, in, the, case, of, unionized, competitors, between, 2000, and, 2010, walmart, s, entry, into, new, areas, often, lowered, local, food, prices, at, other, stores, however, recent, studies, have, not, found, the, same, effect, suggesting, that, retailers, may, have, changed, their, competitive, strategies, while, the, idea, that, walmart, destroys, small, businesses, is, widely, assumed, to, be, true, research, so, far, suggests, that, walmart, superstores, have, little, effect, on, smaller, retailers, such, as, mom, and, pop, businesses, differences, in, impact, appear, to, be, specific, to, the, goods, sold, small, retailers, may, experience, difficulty, if, they, rely, on, selling, products, identical, to, those, at, walmart, or, if, they, try, to, sell, at, lower, prices, dollar, stores, such, as, family, dollar, and, dollar, general, have, been, able, to, find, a, small, niche, market, and, compete, successfully, against, walmart, in, 2004, walmart, responded, by, testing, its, own, dollar, store, concept, a, subsection, of, some, stores, called, pennies, n, cents, walmart, also, had, to, face, fierce, competition, in, some, foreign, markets, for, example, in, germany, it, had, captured, just, 2, percent, of, the, german, food, market, following, its, entry, into, the, market, in, 1997, and, remained, a, secondary, player, behind, aldi, with, 19, percent, in, may, 2006, after, entering, the, south, korean, market, in, 1998, walmart, sold, all, 16, of, its, south, korean,

tried, to, reproduce, its, model, overseas, in, china, walmart, hopes, to, succeed, by, adapting, and, doing, things, preferable, to, chinese, citizens, for, example, it, found, that, chinese, consumers, preferred, to, select, their, own, live, fish, and, seafood, stores, began, displaying, the, meat, uncovered, and, installed, fish, tanks, leading, to, higher, sales, in, the, united,

of, 63, 214, walmart, reports, that, during, times, of, rising, inflation, customers, become, more, sensitive, to, rising, food, prices, buying, less, expensive, food, items, such, as, hot, dogs, and, canned, tuna, rather, than, deli, cold, cuts, they, also, see, more, upper, income, shoppers, looking, for, bargains, walmart, shoppers, have, been, reported, to, be, politically, conservative, a, poll, after, the, 2004, u, s, presidential, election, reported, that, 76, percent, of, voters, who, shopped, at, walmart, once, a, week, reported, voting, for, george, w, bush, while, only, 23, percent, supported, senator, john, kerry, when, measured, against, similar, retailers, in, the, u, s, in, 2006, frequent, walmart, shoppers, were, rated, the, most, politically, conservative, as, of, 2014, 54, percent, of, americans, who, preferred, to, shop, at, walmart, reported, that, they, opposed, same, sex, marriage, while, 40, percent, were, in, favor, reflecting, the, store, s, southern,

over, us, 1, billion, annually, in, 2006, walmart, took, steps, to, expand, its, u, s, customer, base, announcing, a, modification, in, its, u, s, stores, from, a, one, size, fits, all, merchandising, strategy, to, one, designed, to, reflect, each, of, six, demographic, groups, african, americans, the, affluent, empty, nesters, hispanics, suburbanites, and, rural, residents, around, six, months, later, it, unveiled, a, new, slogan, saving, people, money, so, they, can, live, better, lives, walmart, has, also, made, steps, to, appeal, to, more, liberal, customers, for, example, by, rejecting,

firearms, and, ammunition, in, 2019, after, 23, people, were, killed, in, a, mass, shooting, at, a, walmart, store, in, el, paso, texas, walmart, announced, that, it, would, stop, selling, all, handgun, ammunition, and, certain, short, barreled, rifle, ammunition, the, company, also, announced, that, it, would, stop, selling, handguns, in, alaska, the, only, state, where, the, company, still, sold, handguns, the, move, was, expected, to, reduce, walmart, s, u, s, market, share, in, ammunition, from, around, 20, to, around, 6, 9, walmart, also, stated, that, it, was, respectfully, requesting, that, customers, not, openly, carry, weapons, in, walmart, stores, except, for, authorized, law, enforcement, officers, following, the, fatal, police, shooting, of, walter, wallace, jr, in, october, 2020, walmart, temporarily, removed, gun, and, ammunition, displays, in, thousands, of, stores, across, the, u, s, from, sales, floors, grounding, their, reason, in, concerns, of, civil, unrest, company, spokesman, kory, lundberg, said, in, a, statement, that, we, have, seen, some, isolated, civil, unrest, and, as, we, have, done, on, several, occasions, over, the, last, few, years, we, have, moved, our, firearms, and, ammunition, off, the, sales, floor, as, a, precaution, for, the, safety, of, our, associates, and, customers, firearms, and, ammunition, will, still, be, available, for, purchase, on, request, but, the, duration, of, the, removal, of, both, from, the, sales, floor, remains, undetermined, many, walmart, technology, projects, are, coded, in, the, open,

serves, 80, million, visitors, per, month, and, 15, million, items, alex, grigoryan, of, walmart, labs, released, a, statement, on, medium, com, on, october, 3, 2016, explaining, the, details, of, the, applications, and, the, scale, that, they, operate, at, walmart, as, the, largest, retailer, in, the, u, s, walmart, collects, and, analyzes, a, large, amount, of, consumer, data, the, big, data, sets, are, mined, for, use, in, predictive, analytics, which, allow, the, company, to, optimize, operations, by, predicting, customer, s, habits, walmart, s, datacenter, is, unofficially, referred, to, as, area, 71, in, april, 2011, walmart, acquired, kosmix, to, develop, software, for, analyzing, real, time, data, streams, in, august, 2012, walmart, announced, its, polaris, search, engine, the, amount, of, data, gathered, by, walmart, has, raised, privacy, concerns, in, 2016, walmart, began, a, drive, to, automate, much, of, the, cash, handling, process, walmart, began, replacing, employees, who, count, currency, by, hand, with, machines, that, count, 8, bills, per, second, and, 3, 000, coins, a, minute, the, processing, machines, located, in, the, back, of, stores, allow, cashiers, to, process, the, money, for, electronic, depositing, sam, walton, believed, that, the, company, s, contribution, to, society, was, that, it, operated, efficiently, thereby, lowering, the, cost, of, living, for, customers, and, therefore, in, that, sense, was, a, powerful, force, for, good, despite, his, refusal, to, contribute, cash, to, philanthropic, causes, having, begun, to, feel, that, his, wealth, attracted, people, who, wanted, nothing, more, than, a, handout, he, explained, that, while, he, believed, his, family, had, been, fortunate, and, wished, to, use, his, wealth, to, aid, worthy, causes, like, education, they, could, not, be, expected, to, solve, every, personal, problem, that, comes, to, attention, he, explained, later, in, his, autobiography, we, feel, very, strongly, that, wal, mart, really, is, not, and, should, not, be, in, the, charity, business, stating, any, debit, has, to, be, passed, along, to, somebody, either, shareholders, or, our, customers, since, sam, walton, s, death, in, 1992, however, walmart, and, the, walmart, foundation, dramatically, increased, charitable, giving, for, example, in, 2005, walmart, donated, us, 20, million, in, cash, and, merchandise, for, hurricane, katrina, relief, and, in, 2020, they, committed, 25, million, to, organizations, on, the, frontlines, of, the, covid, 19, pandemic, response, today, walmart, s, charitable, donations, approach, us, 1, billion, each, year, as, of, january, 2021, healthcare, workers, could, get, vaccines, through, walmart, in, new, mexico, and, arkansas, walmart, planned, to, offer, vaccines, in, georgia, indiana, louisiana, maryland, new, jersey, south, carolina, texas, chicago, and, puerto, rico, with, the, target, of, delivering, between, 10, million, and, 13, million, doses, per, month, at, full, capacity, in, may, 2021, walmart, said, that, starting, from, may, 18, all, its, fully, vaccinated, employees, could, stop, wearing, masks, at, work, following, the, guidance, from, the, u, s, centers, for, disease, control, and, prevention, a, 2005, story, in, the, washington, post, reported, that, wal, mart, s, discounting, on, food, alone, boosts, the, welfare, of, american, shoppers, by, at, least, us, 50, billion, per, year, a, study, in, 2005, at, the, massachusetts, institute, of, technology, mit, measured, the, effect, on, consumer, welfare, and, found, that, the, poorest, segment, of, the, population, benefits, the, most, from, the, existence, of, discount, retailers, in, 2006, american, newspaper, columnist, george, will, stated, that, in, terms, of, economic, effects, wal, mart, and, its, effects, save, shoppers, more, than, us, 200, billion, a, year, dwarfing, such, government, programs, as, food, stamps, us, 28, 6, billion, and, the, earned, income, tax, credit, us, 34, 6, billion, kenneth, stone, professor, of, economics, at, iowa, state, university, in, a, paper, published, in, farm, foundation, 1997, found, that, some, small, towns, can, lose, almost, half, of, their, retail, trade, within, ten, years, of, a, walmart, store, opening, presumably, people, who, previously, shopped, in, towns, without, wal, mart, stores, choose, to, shop, in, towns, with, wal, mart, stores, part, of, an, older, pattern, in, which, smaller, centers, lose, retail, sales, to, larger, ones, stone, compared, the, changes, to, previous, competitors, that, small, town, shops, have, faced, in, the, past, such, as, the, development, of, the, railroads, the, sears, roebuck, catalog, and, shopping, malls, he, concluded, that, small, towns, are, more, affected, by, discount, mass, merchandiser, stores, than, larger, towns, and, that, shop, owners, who, adapt, to, the, ever, changing, retail, market, can, co, exist, and, even, thrive, in, this, type, of, environment, in, later, research, artz, and, stone, 2006, reported, that, in, mississippi, the, impact, of, opening, a, walmart, was, much, larger, on, existing, retailers, in, rural, communities, 17, than, more, urban, ones, 4, this, also, suggests, that, walmart, has, achieved, its, strongest, growth, in, non, metropolitan, areas, which, tend, to, be, low, income, studies, of, the, impact, of, walmart, tend, to, focus, on, supercenters, rather, than, neighborhood, markets, comparisons, of, performance, metrics, such, as, sales, per, square, foot, suggest, that, supermarkets, and, other, high, volume, retailers, in, direct, competition, with, walmart, supercenters, show, significant, decreases, in, profit, margins, while, walmart, has, often, been, said, to, be, a, destroyer, of, small, businesses, much, of, this, is, anecdotal, research, so, far, suggests, that, walmart, superstores, have, little, effect, on, smaller, retailers, such, as, mom, and, pop, businesses, a, 2008, economic, analysis, published, in, the, journal, economic, inquiry, suggested, that, the, process, of, creative, destruction, unleashed, by, wal, mart, has, had, no, statistically, significant, long, run, impact, on, the, overall, size, and, profitability, of, the, small, business, sector, in, the, united, states, impact, appears, to, be, related, to, a, number, of, factors, with, a, key, factor, being, the, goods, offered, for, sale, a, study, by, ailawadi, and, others, 2010, examined, the, impact, of, new, walmarts, in, detail, she, reported, that, median, sales, dropped, 40, percent, at, similar, high, volume, stores, 17, percent, at, supermarkets, and, 6, percent, at, drugstores, however, 30, percent, of, specific, product, categories, at, high, volume, stores, were, unaffected, many, retailers, reduced, prices, and, cut, product, selection, in, an, attempt, to, compete, directly, with, walmart, in, effect, attacking, its, areas, of, strength, a, more, successful, approach, was, to, track, sales, identify, vulnerable, categories, and, increase, the, range, of, products, in, those, categories, by, including, products, at, both, top, and, bottom, price, points, and, offering, temporary, promotions, on, those, items, retailers, could, attract, both, customers, who, were, price, conscious, and, those, interested, in, a, wider, range, of, options, a, small, store, that, specialized, in, a, particular, product, area, could, compete, effectively, against, walmart, small, specialized, stores, are, less, effective, against, big, box, category, killer, chains, such, as, home, depot, and, best, buy, electronics, some, studies, have, suggested, that, the, impact, a, walmart, store, has, on, a, local, business, is, correlated, to, its, distance, from, the, store, david, merriman, joseph, persky, julie, davis, and, ron, baiman, 2012, outlined, the, impacts, of, walmart, in, chicago, based, on, three, annual, surveys, of, enterprises, within, a, four, mile, radius, of, a, new, chicago, walmart, it, shows, that, the, probability, of, going, out, of, business, was, significantly, higher, for, establishments, close, to, that, store, the, overall, findings, of, this, study, reinforce, the, contention, that, large, city, walmarts, like, those, in, small, towns, absorb, retail, sales, from, nearby, stores, without, significantly, expanding, the, market, ellickson, grieco, 2013, report, in, the, journal, of, urban, economics, that, wal, marts, most, strongly, affect, outlets, of, larger, chains, that, are, within, 2, miles, 3, 2, km, of, their, location, a, 2022, literature, review, concludes, that, there, is, no, consensus, on, the, impact, of, walmart, on, local, employment, but, most, studies, on, the, topic, point, to, a, modest, increase, in, retail, employment, for, example, studies, at, the, university, of, missouri, found, that, a, new, store, increases, net, retail, employment, in, the, county, by, 100, jobs, in, the, short, term, half, of, which, disappear, over, five, years, as, other, retail, establishments, close, similarly, a, net, increase, in, employment, 55, jobs, was, found, in, a, study, of, west, virginia, counties, between, 1989, and, 1998, like, other, chain, stores, walmart, tends, to, hire, local, employees, for, low, skilled, jobs, with, low, wages, and, minimal, benefits, this, may, increase, employees, reliance, on, public, assistance, programs, effectively, transferring, costs, away, from, employers, onto, taxpayers, studies, examining, aggregate, retail, wage, data, from, states, and, counties, before, and, after, the, arrival, of, walmart, are, mixed, some, results, particularly, from, nonmetropolitan, areas, in, the, south, and, central, united, states, suggest, lowered, wages, other, studies, have, found, no, effect, e, g, pennsylvania, or, an, increase, in, wages, e, g, maryland, a, 2004, paper, by, goetz, and, swaminathan, suggested, that, u, s, counties, with, walmart, stores, suffered, increased, poverty, compared, with, counties, without, wal, marts, it, is, difficult, to, distinguish, the, effects, of, opening, a, walmart, from, other, factors, some, of, which, may, be, related, to, the, decision, to, open, a, store, known, as, endogeneity, bias, this, makes, it, difficult, to, determine, whether, walmart, chooses, to, establish, itself, in, communities, with, greater, poverty, and, joblessness, or, creates, more, poverty, and, joblessness, studies, of, socioeconomic, well, being, civic, participation, and, community, welfare, suggest, that, large, non, locally, owned, businesses, tend, to, be, centralized, and, vertically, integrated, rely, on, remote, sources, and, support, services, and, move, money, expertise, and, power, away, from, local, communities, large, externally, oriented, businesses, tend, to, be, associated, with, lower, local, standards, of, living, greater, inequality, and, less, social, and, civic, participation, this, research, is, not, specific, to, walmart, but, to, large, businesses, in, general, in, broader, economic, terms, the, economic, policy, institute, estimated, that, between, 2001, and, 2006, wal, mart, s, trade, deficit, with, china, alone, represented, a, loss, of, nearly, 200, 000, u, s, jobs, during, this, period, wal, mart, was, responsible, for, 9, 3, of, total, u, s, imports, from, china, increasing, the, u, s, trade, deficit, by, an, estimated, 17, 1, billion, this, represents, about, 200, 000, jobs, most, of, them, in, the, manufacturing, sector, 133, 000, a, 2014, story, in, the, guardian, reported, that, the, wal, mart, foundation, was, boosting, its, efforts, to, work, with, u, s, manufacturers, in, february, 2014, the, walmart, foundation, pledged, to, support, domestic, manufacturers, by, buying, us, 250, billion, worth, of, american, made, products, in, the, next, decade, between, 2014, and, 2017, the, walmart, u, s, manufacturing, innovation, fund, gave, 10, million, in, grants, to, research, and, academic, institutions, for, projects, that, improve, domestic, manufacturing, for, the, 2020, fiscal, year, walmart, reported, that, nearly, two, thirds, of, its, merchandise, was, made, assembled, or, grown, in, the, united, states, as, of, march, 2021, walmart, pledged, to, buy, an, additional, 350, billion, worth, of, american, based, items, over, the, next, decade, a, 2001, mckinsey, global, institute, study, of, u, s, labor, productivity, growth, between, 1995, and, 2000, concluded, that, wal, mart, directly, and, indirectly, caused, the, bulk, of, the, productivity, acceleration, in, general, merchandise, representing, 16, percent, of, total, productivity, growth, in, the, retail, sector, walmart, s, transformative, use, of, information, technology, particularly, in, supply, chain, management, is, identified, as, a, major, reason, for, its, impact, on, productivity, per, man, hour, for, every, dollar, spent, by, walmart, to, improve, its, own, technology, an, estimated, ten, dollars, has, been, invested, by, suppliers, throughout, its, supply, chain, on, their, own, systems, and, software, economist, robert, solow, has, emphasized, the, importance, of, imitation, and, adaptation, in, addition, to, improving, its, own, efficiency, walmart, s, innovations, have, been, adopted, by, its, competitors, so, that, they, can, compete, with, over, 2, 3, million, employees, worldwide, walmart, has, faced, a, torrent, of, lawsuits, and, issues, with, regards, to, its, workforce, these, issues, involve, low, wages, poor, working, conditions, inadequate, health, care, and, issues, involving, the, company, s, strong, anti, union, policies, in, november, 2013, the, national, labor, relations, board, nlrb, announced, that, it, had, found, that, in, 13, u, s, states, wal, mart, had, pressured, employees, not, to, engage, in, strikes, on, black, friday, and, had, illegally, disciplined, workers, who, had, engaged, in, strikes, critics, point, to, walmart, s, high, turnover, rate, as, evidence, of, an, unhappy, workforce, although, other, factors, may, be,
