1800s, martineau, tocqueville, marx, spencer, le, bon, ward, pareto, t, nnies, veblen, simmel, durkheim, addams, mead, weber, du, bois, mannheim, elias, a, sociological, theory, is, a, supposition, that, intends, to, consider, analyze, and, or, explain, objects, of, social, reality, from, a, sociological, perspective, 14, drawing, connections, between, individual, concepts, in, order, to, organize, and, substantiate, sociological, knowledge, hence, such, knowledge, is, composed, of, complex, theoretical, frameworks, and, methodology, these, theories, range, in, scope, from, concise, yet, thorough, descriptions, of, a, single, social, process, to, broad, inconclusive, paradigms, for, analysis, and, interpretation, some, sociological, theories, explain, aspects, of, the, social, world, and, enable, prediction, about, future, events, while, others, function, as, broad, perspectives, which, guide, further, sociological, analyses, prominent, sociological, theorists, include, talcott, parsons, robert, k, merton, randall, collins, james, samuel, coleman, peter, blau, niklas, luhmann, immanuel, wallerstein, george, homans, theda, skocpol, gerhard, lenski, pierre, van, den, berghe, and, jonathan, h, turner, kenneth, allan, 2006, distinguishes, sociological, theory, from, social, theory, in, that, the, former, consists, of, abstract, and, testable, propositions, about, society, heavily, relying, on, the, scientific, method, which, aims, for, objectivity, and, to, avoid, passing, value, judgments, in, contrast, social, theory, according, to, allan, focuses, less, on, explanation, and, more, on, commentary, and, critique, of, modern, society, as, such, social, theory, is, generally, closer, to, continental, philosophy, insofar, as, it, is, less, concerned, with, objectivity, and, derivation, of, testable, propositions, thus, more, likely, to, propose, normative, judgments, sociologist, robert, k, merton, 1949, argued, that, sociological, theory, deals, with, social, mechanisms, which, are, essential, in, exemplifying, the, middle, ground, between, social, law, and, description, 43, 4, merton, believed, these, social, mechanisms, to, be, social, processes, having, designated, consequences, for, designated, parts, of, the, social, structure, prominent, social, theorists, include, j, rgen, habermas, anthony, giddens, michel, foucault, dorothy, smith, roberto, unger, alfred, sch, tz, jeffrey, alexander, and, jacques, derrida, there, are, also, prominent, scholars, who, could, be, seen, as, being, in, between, social, and, sociological, theories, such, as, harold, garfinkel, herbert, blumer, claude, l, vi, strauss, pierre, bourdieu, and, erving, goffman, the, field, of, sociology, itself, is, a, relatively, new, discipline, and, so, by, extension, is, the, field, of, sociological, theory, both, date, back, to, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, periods, of, drastic, social, change, where, societies, would, begin, to, see, for, example, the, emergence, of, industrialization, urbanization, democracy, and, early, capitalism, provoking, particularly, western, thinkers, to, start, becoming, considerably, more, aware, of, society, as, such, the, field, of, sociology, initially, dealt, with, broad, historical, processes, relating, to, these, changes, through, a, well, cited, survey, of, sociological, theory, randall, collins, 1994, retroactively, labels, various, theorists, as, belonging, to, four, theoretical, traditions, functionalism, conflict, symbolic, interactionism, and, utilitarianism, while, modern, sociological, theory, descends, predominately, from, functionalist, durkheim, and, conflict, oriented, marx, and, weber, perspectives, of, social, structure, it, also, takes, great, influence, from, the, symbolic, interactionist, tradition, accounting, for, theories, of, pragmatism, mead, cooley, and, micro, level, structure, simmel, likewise, utilitarianism, aka, rational, choice, or, social, exchange, although, often, associated, with, economics, is, an, established, tradition, within, sociological, theory, lastly, as, argued, by, raewyn, connell, 2007, a, tradition, that, is, often, forgotten, is, that, of, social, darwinism, which, applies, the, logic, of, biological, evolution, to, the, social, world, this, tradition, often, aligns, with, classical, functionalism, and, is, associated, with, several, founders, of, sociology, primarily, herbert, spencer, lester, f, ward, and, william, graham, sumner, contemporary, sociological, theory, retains, traces, of, each, of, these, traditions, which, are, by, no, means, mutually, exclusive, a, broad, historical, paradigm, in, sociology, structural, functionalism, addresses, social, structures, in, its, entirety, and, in, terms, of, the, necessary, functions, possessed, by, its, constituent, elements, a, common, parallel, used, by, functionalists, known, as, the, organic, or, biological, analogy, popularized, by, herbert, spencer, is, to, regard, norms, and, institutions, as, organs, that, work, toward, the, proper, functioning, of, the, entire, body, of, society, the, perspective, was, implicit, in, the, original, sociological, positivism, of, auguste, comte, but, was, theorized, in, full, by, durkheim, again, with, respect, to, observable, structural, laws, functionalism, also, has, an, anthropological, basis, in, the, work, of, theorists, such, as, marcel, mauss, bronis, aw, malinowski, and, alfred, radcliffe, brown, the, latter, of, whom, through, explicit, usage, introduced, the, structural, prefix, to, the, concept, classical, functionalist, theory, is, generally, united, by, its, tendency, towards, the, biological, analogy, and, notions, of, social, evolutionism, as, giddens, states, functionalist, thought, from, comte, onwards, has, looked, particularly, towards, biology, as, the, science, providing, the, closest, and, most, compatible, model, for, social, science, biology, has, been, taken, to, provide, a, guide, to, conceptualizing, the, structure, and, the, function, of, social, systems, and, to, analyzing, processes, of, evolution, via, mechanisms, of, adaptation, functionalism, strongly, emphasizes, the, pre, eminence, of, the, social, world, over, its, individual, parts, i, e, its, constituent, actors, human, subjects, conflict, theory, is, a, method, that, attempts, in, a, scientific, manner, to, provide, causal, explanations, to, the, existence, of, conflict, in, society, thus, conflict, theorists, look, at, the, ways, in, which, conflict, arises, and, is, resolved, in, society, as, well, as, how, every, conflict, is, unique, such, theories, describe, that, the, origins, of, conflict, in, societies, are, founded, in, the, unequal, distribution, of, resources, and, power, though, there, is, no, universal, definition, of, what, resources, necessarily, includes, most, theorists, follow, max, weber, s, point, of, view, weber, viewed, conflict, as, the, result, of, class, status, and, power, being, ways, of, defining, individuals, in, any, given, society, in, this, sense, power, defines, standards, thus, people, abide, by, societal, rules, and, expectation, due, to, an, inequality, of, power, karl, marx, is, believed, to, be, the, father, of, social, conflict, theory, in, which, social, conflict, refers, to, the, struggle, between, segments, of, society, over, valued, resources, by, the, 19th, century, a, small, population, in, the, west, had, become, capitalists, individuals, who, own, and, operate, factories, and, other, businesses, in, pursuit, of, profits, owning, virtually, all, large, scale, means, of, production, however, theorists, believe, that, capitalism, turned, most, other, people, into, industrial, workers, or, in, marx, s, terms, proletarians, individuals, who, because, of, the, structure, of, capitalist, economies, must, sell, their, labor, for, wages, it, is, through, this, notion, that, conflict, theories, challenge, historically, dominant, ideologies, drawing, attention, to, such, power, differentials, as, class, gender, and, race, conflict, theory, is, therefore, a, macrosociological, approach, in, which, society, is, interpreted, as, an, arena, of, inequality, that, generates, conflict, and, social, change, 15, other, important, sociologists, associated, with, social, conflict, theory, include, harriet, martineau, jane, addams, and, w, e, b, du, bois, rather, than, observing, the, ways, in, which, social, structures, help, societies, to, operate, this, sociological, approach, looks, at, how, social, patterns, cause, certain, individuals, to, become, dominant, in, society, while, causing, others, to, be, oppressed, accordingly, some, criticisms, to, this, theory, are, that, it, disregards, how, shared, values, and, the, way, in, which, people, rely, on, each, other, help, to, unify, society, symbolic, interaction, often, associated, with, interactionism, phenomenological, sociology, dramaturgy, sociology, and, interpretivism, is, a, sociological, approach, that, places, emphasis, on, subjective, meanings, and, usually, through, analysis, on, the, empirical, unfolding, of, social, processes, 16, such, processes, are, believed, to, rely, on, individuals, and, their, actions, which, is, ultimately, necessary, for, society, to, exists, this, phenomenon, was, first, theorized, by, george, herbert, mead, who, described, it, as, the, outcome, of, collaborative, joint, action, the, approach, focuses, on, creating, a, theoretical, framework, that, observes, society, as, the, product, of, everyday, interactions, of, individuals, in, other, words, society, in, its, most, basic, form, is, nothing, more, than, the, shared, reality, constructed, by, individuals, as, they, interact, with, one, another, in, this, sense, individuals, interact, within, countless, situations, through, symbolic, interpretations, of, their, given, reality, whereby, society, is, a, complex, ever, changing, mosaic, of, subjective, meanings, 19, some, critics, of, this, approach, argue, that, it, focuses, only, on, ostensible, characteristics, of, social, situations, while, disregarding, the, effects, of, culture, race, or, gender, i, e, social, historical, structures, important, sociologists, traditionally, associated, with, this, approach, include, george, herbert, mead, herbert, blumer, and, erving, goffman, new, contributions, to, the, perspective, meanwhile, include, those, of, howard, becker, gary, alan, fine, david, altheide, robert, prus, peter, m, hall, david, r, maines, as, well, as, others, it, is, also, in, this, tradition, that, the, radical, empirical, approach, of, ethnomethodology, emerged, from, the, work, of, harold, garfinkel, utilitarianism, is, often, referred, to, as, exchange, theory, or, rational, choice, theory, in, the, context, of, sociology, this, tradition, tends, to, privilege, the, agency, of, individual, rational, actors, assuming, that, within, interactions, individuals, always, seek, to, maximize, their, own, self, interest, as, argued, by, josh, whitford, 2002, rational, actors, can, be, characterized, as, possessing, four, basic, elements, exchange, theory, is, specifically, attributed, to, the, work, of, george, c, homans, peter, blau, and, richard, emerson, organizational, sociologists, james, g, march, and, herbert, a, simon, noted, that, an, individual, s, rationality, is, bounded, by, the, context, or, organizational, setting, the, utilitarian, perspective, in, sociology, was, most, notably, revitalized, in, the, late, 20th, century, by, the, work, of, former, asa, president, james, samuel, coleman, overall, there, is, a, strong, consensus, regarding, the, central, theoretical, questions, and, the, key, problems, that, emerge, from, explicating, such, questions, in, sociology, in, general, sociological, theory, attempts, to, answer, the, following, three, questions, 1, what, is, action, 2, what, is, social, order, and, 3, what, determines, social, change, in, the, myriad, of, attempts, to, answer, these, questions, three, predominantly, theoretical, i, e, not, empirical, issues, emerge, largely, inherited, from, classical, theoretical, traditions, the, consensus, on, the, central, theoretical, problems, is, how, to, link, transcend, or, cope, with, the, following, big, three, dichotomies, lastly, sociological, theory, often, grapples, with, a, subset, of, all, three, central, problems, through, the, problem, of, integrating, or, transcending, the, divide, between, micro, meso, and, macro, level, social, phenomena, these, problems, are, not, altogether, empirical, rather, they, are, epistemological, they, arise, from, the, conceptual, imagery, and, analytical, analogies, that, sociologists, use, to, describe, the, complexity, of, social, processes, the, issue, of, subjectivity, and, objectivity, can, be, divided, into, a, concern, over, a, the, general, possibilities, of, social, actions, and, b, the, specific, problem, of, social, scientific, knowledge, in, regard, to, the, former, the, subjective, is, often, equated, though, not, necessarily, with, the, individual, and, the, individual, s, intentions, and, interpretations, of, the, objective, the, objective, on, the, other, hand, is, usually, considered, to, be, any, public, external, action, or, outcome, on, up, to, society, writ, large, a, primary, question, for, social, theorists, is, how, knowledge, reproduces, along, the, chain, of, subjective, objective, subjective, that, is, to, say, how, is, intersubjectivity, achieved, while, historically, qualitative, methods, have, attempted, to, tease, out, subjective, interpretations, quantitative, survey, methods, also, attempt, to, capture, individual, subjectivities, moreover, some, qualitative, methods, take, a, radical, approach, to, objective, description, in, situ, insofar, as, subjectivity, objectivity, are, concerned, with, b, the, specific, problem, of, social, scientific, knowledge, such, concern, results, from, the, fact, that, a, sociologist, is, part, of, the, very, object, they, seek, to, explain, as, expressed, by, bourdieu, how, can, the, sociologist, effect, in, practice, this, radical, doubting, which, is, indispensable, for, bracketing, all, the, presuppositions, inherent, in, the, fact, that, she, is, a, social, being, that, she, is, therefore, socialized, and, led, to, feel, like, a, fish, in, water, within, that, social, world, whose, structures, she, has, internalized, how, can, she, prevent, the, social, world, itself, from, carrying, out, the, construction, of, the, object, in, a, sense, through, her, through, these, unself, conscious, operations, or, operations, unaware, of, themselves, of, which, she, is, the, apparent, subject, structure, and, agency, or, determinism, and, voluntarism, form, an, enduring, ontological, debate, in, social, theory, do, social, structures, determine, an, individual, s, behaviour, or, does, human, agency, in, this, context, agency, refers, to, the, capacity, of, an, individual, to, act, independently, and, make, free, choices, whereas, structure, relates, to, factors, that, limit, or, affect, the, choices, and, actions, of, the, individual, e, g, social, class, religion, gender, ethnicity, etc, discussions, over, the, primacy, of, either, structure, and, agency, relate, to, the, core, of, sociological, ontology, i, e, what, is, the, social, world, made, of, what, is, a, cause, in, the, social, world, and, what, is, an, effect, a, perennial, question, within, this, debate, is, that, of, social, reproduction, how, are, structures, specifically, structures, that, produce, inequality, reproduced, through, the, choices, of, individuals, synchrony, and, diachrony, or, statics, and, dynamics, within, social, theory, are, terms, that, refer, to, a, distinction, emerging, out, of, the, work, of, levi, strauss, who, inherited, it, from, the, linguistics, of, ferdinand, de, saussure, the, former, slices, moments, of, time, for, analysis, thus, it, is, an, analysis, of, static, social, reality, diachrony, on, the, other, hand, attempts, to, analyze, dynamic, sequences, following, saussure, synchrony, would, describe, social, phenomena, at, a, specific, point, of, time, while, diachrony, would, refer, to, unfolding, processes, in, time, in, anthony, giddens, introduction, to, central, problems, in, social, theory, he, states, that, in, order, to, show, the, interdependence, of, action, and, structure, we, must, grasp, the, time, space, relations, inherent, in, the, constitution, of, all, social, interaction, and, like, structure, and, agency, time, is, integral, to, discussion, of, social, reproduction, in, terms, of, sociology, historical, sociology, is, often, better, positioned, to, analyze, social, life, as, diachronic, while, survey, research, takes, a, snapshot, of, social, life, and, is, thus, better, equipped, to, understand, social, life, as, synchronic, some, argue, that, the, synchrony, of, social, structure, is, a, methodological, perspective, rather, than, an, ontological, claim, nonetheless, the, problem, for, theory, is, how, to, integrate, the, two, manners, of, recording, and, thinking, about, social, data, the, contemporary, discipline, of, sociology, is, theoretically, multi, paradigmatic, encompassing, a, greater, range, of, subjects, including, communities, organizations, and, relationships, than, when, the, discipline, first, began, strain, theory, is, a, theoretical, perspective, that, identifies, anomie, i, e, normlessness, as, the, result, of, a, society, that, provides, little, moral, guidance, to, individuals, 134, emile, durkheim, 1893, first, described, anomie, as, one, of, the, results, of, an, inequitable, division, of, labour, within, a, society, observing, that, social, periods, of, disruption, resulted, in, greater, anomie, and, higher, rates, of, suicide, and, crimes, in, this, sense, broadly, speaking, during, times, of, great, upheaval, increasing, numbers, of, individuals, cease, to, accept, the, moral, legitimacy, of, society, as, noted, by, sociologist, anthony, r, mawson, 1970, robert, k, merton, would, go, on, to, theorize, that, anomie, as, well, as, some, forms, of, deviant, behavior, derive, largely, from, a, disjunction, between, culturally, prescribed, aspirations, of, a, society, and, socially, structured, avenues, for, realizing, those, aspirations, developed, by, erving, goffman, dramaturgy, aka, dramaturgical, perspective, is, a, particularized, paradigm, of, symbolic, interactionism, that, interprets, life, to, be, a, performance, i, e, a, drama, as, actors, we, have, a, status, i, e, the, part, that, we, play, by, which, we, are, given, various, roles, 16, these, roles, serve, as, a, script, supplying, dialogue, and, action, for, the, characters, i, e, the, people, in, reality, 19, roles, also, involve, props, and, certain, settings, for, example, a, doctor, the, role, uses, instruments, like, a, heart, monitor, the, prop, all, the, while, using, medical, terms, the, script, while, in, their, doctor, s, office, the, setting, 134, in, addition, our, performance, is, the, presentation, of, self, which, is, how, people, perceive, us, based, on, the, ways, in, which, we, portray, ourselves, 134, this, process, known, as, impression, management, begins, with, the, idea, of, personal, performance, mathematical, theory, aka, formal, theory, refers, to, the, use, of, mathematics, in, constructing, social, theories, mathematical, sociology, aims, to, sociological, theory, in, formal, terms, which, such, theories, can, be, understood, to, lack, the, benefits, of, this, approach, not, only, include, increased, clarity, but, also, through, mathematics, the, ability, to, derive, theoretical, implications, that, could, not, be, arrived, at, intuitively, as, such, models, typically, used, in, mathematical, sociology, allow, sociologists, to, understand, how, predictable, local, interactions, are, often, able, to, elicit, global, patterns, of, social, structure, positivism, is, a, philosophy, developed, in, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, by, auguste, comte, that, states, that, the, only, authentic, knowledge, is, scientific, knowledge, and, that, such, knowledge, can, only, come, from, positive, affirmation, of, theories, through, strict, a, scientific, method, society, operates, according, to, laws, just, like, the, physical, world, thus, introspective, or, intuitional, attempts, to, gain, knowledge, are, rejected, the, positivist, approach, has, been, a, recurrent, theme, in, the, history, of, western, thought, from, antiquity, to, the, present, day, postmodernism, adhering, to, anti, theory, and, anti, method, believes, that, due, to, human, subjectivity, discovering, objective, truth, is, impossible, or, unachievable, 10, in, essence, the, postmodernist, perspective, is, one, that, exists, as, a, counter, to, modernist, thought, especially, through, its, mistrust, in, grand, theories, and, ideologies, the, objective, truth, that, is, touted, by, modernist, theory, is, believed, by, postmodernists, to, be, impossible, due, to, the, ever, changing, nature, of, society, whereby, truth, is, also, constantly, subject, to, change, a, postmodernists, purpose, therefore, is, to, achieve, understanding, through, observation, rather, than, data, collection, using, both, micro, and, macro, level, analyses, 53, questions, that, are, asked, by, this, approach, include, how, do, we, understand, societies, or, interpersonal, relations, while, rejecting, the, theories, and, methods, of, the, social, sciences, and, our, assumptions, about, human, nature, and, how, does, power, permeate, social, relations, or, society, and, change, with, the, circumstances, 19, one, of, the, most, prominent, postmodernists, in, the, approach, s, history, is, the, french, philosopher, michel, foucault, the, general, theory, of, crime, refers, to, the, proposition, by, michael, r, gottfredson, and, travis, hirschi, 1990, that, the, main, factor, in, criminal, behaviour, is, the, individual, s, lack, of, self, control, theorists, who, do, not, distinguish, the, differences, that, exist, between, criminals, and, noncriminals, are, considered, to, be, classical, or, control, theorists, such, theorists, believe, that, those, who, perform, deviant, acts, do, so, out, of, enjoyment, without, care, for, consequences, likewise, positivists, view, criminals, actions, as, a, result, of, the, person, themselves, instead, of, the, nature, of, the, person, the, essential, notion, of, labeling, theory, is, that, deviance, and, conformity, result, not, so, much, from, what, people, do, as, from, how, others, respond, to, these, actions, 203, it, also, states, that, a, society, s, reaction, to, specific, behaviors, are, a, major, determinant, of, how, a, person, may, come, to, adopt, a, deviant, label, 204, this, theory, stresses, the, relativity, of, deviance, the, idea, that, people, may, define, the, same, behavior, in, any, number, of, ways, thus, the, labelling, theory, is, a, micro, level, analysis, and, is, often, classified, in, the, social, interactionist, approach, a, hate, crime, can, be, defined, as, a, criminal, act, against, a, person, or, a, person, s, property, by, an, offender, motivated, by, racial, ethnic, religious, or, other, bias, hate, crimes, may, refer, to, race, ancestry, religion, sexual, orientation, and, physical, disabilities, according, to, statistics, canada, the, jewish, community, has, been, the, most, likely, to, be, victim, to, hate, crimes, in, canada, in, 2001, 2002, overall, about, 57, of, hate, crimes, are, motivated, by, ethnicity, and, race, targeting, mainly, blacks, and, asians, while, 43, target, religion, mainly, judaism, and, islam, a, relatively, small, 9, is, motivated, by, sexual, orientation, targets, gays, and, lesbians, 208, 9, physical, traits, do, not, distinguish, criminals, from, non, criminals, but, genetic, factors, together, with, environmental, factors, are, strong, predictors, of, adult, crime, and, violence, 198, 9, most, psychologists, see, deviance, as, the, result, of, unsuccessful, socialization, and, abnormality, in, an, individual, personality, 198, 9, a, psychopath, can, be, defined, as, a, serious, criminal, who, does, not, feel, shame, or, guilt, from, their, actions, as, they, have, little, if, any, sympathy, for, the, people, they, harm, nor, do, they, fear, punishment, 199, individuals, of, such, nature, may, also, be, known, to, have, an, antisocial, personality, disorder, robert, d, hare, one, of, the, world, s, leading, experts, on, psychopathy, developed, an, important, assessment, device, for, psychopathy, known, as, the, psychopathy, checklist, revised, for, many, this, measure, is, the, single, most, important, advancement, to, date, toward, what, will, hopefully, become, our, ultimate, understanding, of, psychopathy, 641, psychopaths, exhibit, a, variety, of, maladaptive, traits, such, as, rarity, in, experience, of, genuine, affection, for, others, moreover, they, are, skilled, at, faking, affection, are, irresponsible, impulsive, hardly, tolerant, of, frustration, and, they, pursue, immediate, gratification, 614, likewise, containment, theory, suggests, that, those, with, a, stronger, conscience, will, be, more, tolerable, to, frustrations, thus, less, likely, to, be, involved, in, criminal, activities, 198, 9, sutherland, and, cressey, 1978, define, white, collar, crime, as, crime, committed, by, persons, of, high, social, position, in, the, course, of, their, occupation, the, white, collar, crime, involves, people, making, use, of, their, occupational, position, to, enrich, themselves, and, others, illegally, which, often, causes, public, harm, in, white, collar, crime, public, harm, wreaked, by, false, advertising, marketing, of, unsafe, products, embezzlement, and, bribery, of, public, officials, is, more, extensive, than, most, people, think, most, of, which, go, unnoticed, and, unpunished, 206, likewise, corporate, crime, refers, to, the, illegal, actions, of, a, corporation, or, people, acting, on, its, behalf, corporate, crime, ranges, from, knowingly, selling, faulty, or, dangerous, products, to, purposely, polluting, the, environment, like, white, collar, crime, most, cases, of, corporate, crime, go, unpunished, and, many, are, not, never, even, known, to, the, public, 206
