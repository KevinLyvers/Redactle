until, the, 1820s, no, new, universities, were, allowed, to, be, founded, in, england, even, in, london, thus, oxford, and, cambridge, had, a, duopoly, which, was, unusual, in, large, western, european, countries, the, new, learning, of, the, renaissance, greatly, influenced, oxford, from, the, late, 15th, century, onwards, among, university, scholars, of, the, period, were, william,

for, the, granting, of, a, charter, securing, privileges, for, the, university, press, and, he, made, significant, contributions, to, the, bodleian, library, the, main, library, of, the, university, from, the, beginnings, of, the, church, of, england, as, the, established, church, until, 1866, membership, of, the, church, was, a, requirement, to, graduate, as, a, bachelor, of, arts, and,

of, experimental, scientists, at, oxford, in, the, 1650s, the, oxford, philosophical, club, which, included, robert, boyle, and, robert, hooke, this, group, which, has, at, times, been, linked, with, boyle, s, invisible, college, held, regular, meetings, at, wadham, under, the, guidance, of, the, college, s, warden, john, wilkins, and, the, group, formed, the, nucleus, that, went, on, to, found, the, royal, society, before, reforms, in, the, early, 19th, century, the, curriculum, at, oxford, was, notoriously, narrow, and, impractical, sir, spencer, walpole, a, historian, of, contemporary, britain, and, a, senior, government, official, had, not, attended, any, university, he, said, few, medical, men, few, solicitors, few, persons, intended, for, commerce, or, trade, ever, dreamed, of, passing, through, a, university, career, he, quoted, the, oxford, university, commissioners, in, 1852, stating, the, education, imparted, at, oxford, was, not, such, as, to, conduce, to, the, advancement, in, life, of, many, persons, except, those, intended, for, the, ministry, nevertheless, walpole, argued, among, the, many, deficiencies, attending, a, university, education, there, was, however, one, good, thing, about, it, and, that, was, the, education, which, the, undergraduates, gave, themselves, it, was, impossible, to, collect, some, thousand, or, twelve, hundred, of, the, best, young, men, in, england, to, give, them, the, opportunity, of, making, acquaintance, with, one, another, and, full, liberty, to, live, their, lives, in, their, own, way, without, evolving, in, the, best, among, them, some, admirable, qualities, of, loyalty, independence, and, self, control, if, the, average, undergraduate, carried, from, university, little, or, no, learning, which, was, of, any, service, to, him, he, carried, from, it, a, knowledge, of, men, and, respect, for, his, fellows, and, himself, a, reverence, for, the, past, a, code, of, honour, for, the, present, which, could, not, but, be, serviceable, he, had, enjoyed, opportunities, of, intercourse, with, men, some, of, whom, were, certain, to, rise, to, the, highest, places, in, the, senate, in, the, church, or, at, the, bar, he, might, have, mixed, with, them, in, his, sports, in, his, studies, and, perhaps, in, his, debating, society, and, any, associations, which, he, had, this, formed, had, been, useful, to, him, at, the, time, and, might, be, a, source, of, satisfaction, to, him, in, after, life, out, of, the, students, who, matriculated, in, 1840, 65, were, sons, of, professionals, 34, were, anglican, ministers, after, graduation, 87, became, professionals, 59, as, anglican, clergy, out, of, the, students, who, matriculated, in, 1870, 59, were, sons, of, professionals, 25, were, anglican, ministers, after, graduation, 87, became, professionals, 42, as, anglican, clergy, m, c, curthoys, and, h, s, jones, argue, that, the, rise, of, organised, sport, was, one, of, the, most, remarkable, and, distinctive, features, of, the, history, of, the, universities, of, oxford, and, cambridge, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, it, was, carried, over, from, the, athleticism, prevalent, at, the, public, schools, such, as, eton, winchester, shrewsbury, and, harrow, all, students, regardless, of, their, chosen, area, of, study, were, required, to, spend, at, least, their, first, year, preparing, for, a, first, year, examination, that, was, heavily, focused, on, classical, languages, science, students, found, this, particularly, burdensome, and, supported, a, separate, science, degree, with, greek, language, study, removed, from, their, required, courses, this, concept, of, a, bachelor, of, science, had, been, adopted, at, other, european, universities, london, university, had, implemented, it, in, 1860, but, an, 1880, proposal, at, oxford, to, replace, the, classical, requirement, with, a, modern, language, like, german, or, french, was, unsuccessful, after, considerable, internal, wrangling, over, the, structure, of, the, arts, curriculum, in, 1886, the, natural, science, preliminary, was, recognised, as, a, qualifying, part, of, the, first, year, examination, at, the, start, of, 1914, the, university, housed, about, 3, 000, undergraduates, and, about, 100, postgraduate, students, during, the, first, world, war, many, undergraduates, and, fellows, joined, the, armed, forces, by, 1918, virtually, all, fellows, were, in, uniform, and, the, student, population, in, residence, was, reduced, to, 12, per, cent, of, the, pre, war, total, the, university, roll, of, service, records, that, in, total, 14, 792, members, of, the, university, served, in, the, war, with, 2, 716, 18, 36, killed, not, all, the, members, of, the, university, who, served, in, the, great, war, were, on, the, allied, side, there, is, a, remarkable, memorial, to, members, of, new, college, who, served, in, the, german, armed, forces, bearing, the, inscription, in, memory, of, the, men, of, this, college, who, coming, from, a, foreign, land, entered, into, the, inheritance, of, this, place, and, returning, fought, and, died, for, their, country, in, the, war,

for, oxford, and, cambridge, archibald, campbell, tait, a, former, headmaster, of, rugby, school, was, a, key, member, of, the, oxford, commission, he, wanted, oxford, to, follow, the, german, and, scottish, model, in, which, the, professorship, was, paramount, the, commission, s, report, envisioned, a, centralised, university, run, predominantly, by, professors, and, faculties, with, a, much, stronger, emphasis, on, research, the, professional, staff, should, be, strengthened, and, better, paid, for, students, restrictions, on, entry, should, be, dropped, and, more, opportunities, given, to, poorer, families, it, called, for, an, enlargement, of, the, curriculum, with, honours, to, be, awarded, in, many, new, fields, undergraduate, scholarships, should, be, open, to, all, britons,
