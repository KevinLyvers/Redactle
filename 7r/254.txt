origin, who, traditionally, lived, a, nomadic, itinerant, lifestyle, linguistic, and, genetic, evidence, suggests, that, the, romani, originated, in, the, indian, subcontinent, in, particular, the, region, of, present, day, state, of, rajasthan, their, subsequent, westward, migration, possibly, in, waves, is, now, believed, by, historians, to, have, occurred, c, 1000, ce, their, name, is, from, the, sanskrit, word, oma, which, means, a, member, of, the, dom, caste, of, travelling, musicians, and, dancers, the, roma, population, moved, west, into, the, ghaznavid, empire, and, later, into, the, byzantine, empire, the, roma, are, thought, to, have, arrived, in, europe, around, the, 13th, to, 14th, century, although, they, are, widely, dispersed, their, most, concentrated, populations, are, believed, to, be, in, bulgaria, hungary, romania, serbia, and, slovakia, in, the, english, language, romani, people, have, long, been, known, by, the, exonym, gypsies, or, gipsies, which, many, roma, consider, a, racial, slur, the, attendees, of, the, first, world, romani, congress, in, 1971, unanimously, voted, to, reject, the, use, of, all, exonyms, for, the, romani, including, gypsy, nonetheless, romani, people, in, the, united, kingdom, commonly, refer, to, themselves, as, gypsies, the, first, roma, to, come, to, the, united, states, arrived, in, virginia, georgia, new, jersey, and, louisiana, during, the, 1500s, romani, slaves, were, first, shipped, to, the, americas, with, columbus, in, 1498, spain, sent, romani, slaves, to, their, louisiana, colony, between, 1762, and, 1800, an, afro, romani, community, exists, in, st, martin, parish, due, to, intermarriage, of, freed, african, american, and, romani, enslaved, persons, the, roma, population, in, the, united, states, is, estimated, at, more, than, one, million, there, are, an, estimated, 1, million, roma, in, the, united, states, and, between, 800, 000, and, 1, million, in, brazil, most, of, whose, ancestors, emigrated, in, the, 19th, century, from, eastern, europe, brazilian, romani, are, mostly, descendant, from, german, italian, sinti, in, the, south, southeast, regions, and, roma, and, calon, people, brazil, also, includes, a, notable, romani, community, descended, from, sinti, and, roma, deportees, from, the, portuguese, empire, during, the, portuguese, inquisition, in, migrations, since, the, late, 19th, century, romani, have, also, moved, to, other, countries, in, south, america, and, canada, the, romani, language, is, an, indo, aryan, language, with, strong, balkan, and, greek, influence, it, is, divided, into, several, dialects, which, together, are, estimated, to, have, over, 2, million, speakers, because, the, language, has, traditionally, been, oral, many, romani, are, native, speakers, of, the, dominant, language, in, their, country, of, residence, or, else, of, mixed, languages, combining, the, dominant, language, with, a, dialect, of, romani, in, varieties, sometimes, called, para, romani, rom, literally, means, husband, in, the, romani, language, with, the, plural, roma, the, feminine, of, rom, in, the, romani, language, is, romni, romli, romnije, or, romlije, however, in, most, cases, in, other, languages, rom, is, now, used, for, individuals, regardless, of, gender, it, has, the, variants, dom, and, lom, which, may, be, related, to, the, sanskrit, words, dam, pati, lord, of, the, house, husband, dama, to, subdue, lom, hair, lomaka, hairy, loman, roman, hairy, roma, a, man, with, beard, and, long, hair, another, possible, origin, is, from, sanskrit, doma, member, of, a, low, caste, of, travelling, musicians, and, dancers, despite, their, presence, in, the, country, and, neighboring, nations, the, word, is, not, related, in, any, way, to, the, name, of, romania, romani, is, the, feminine, adjective, while, romano, is, the, masculine, adjective, some, romanies, use, rom, or, roma, as, an, ethnic, name, while, others, such, as, the, sinti, or, the, romanichal, do, not, use, this, term, as, a, self, description, for, the, entire, ethnic, group, sometimes, rom, and, romani, are, spelled, with, a, double, r, i, e, rrom, and, rromani, in, this, case, rr, is, used, to, represent, the, phoneme, also, written, as, and, rh, which, in, some, romani, dialects, has, remained, different, from, the, one, written, with, a, single, r, the, rr, spelling, is, common, in, certain, institutions, such, as, the, inalco, institute, in, paris, or, used, in, certain, countries, e, g, romania, to, distinguish, from, the, endonym, homonym, for, romanians, sg, rom, n, pl, rom, ni, in, norway, romani, is, used, exclusively, for, an, older, northern, romani, speaking, population, which, arrived, in, the, 16th, century, while, rom, romanes, is, used, to, describe, vlax, romani, speaking, groups, which, have, arrived, since, the, 19th, century, in, the, english, language, according, to, the, oxford, english, dictionary, rom, is, both, a, noun, with, the, plural, roma, or, roms, and, an, adjective, similarly, romani, romany, is, both, a, noun, with, the, plural, romani, the, romani, romanies, or, romanis, and, an, adjective, both, rom, and, romani, have, been, in, use, in, english, since, the, 19th, century, as, an, alternative, for, gypsy, romani, was, sometimes, spelled, rommany, but, more, often, romany, while, today, romani, is, the, most, popular, spelling, occasionally, the, double, r, spelling, e, g, rroma, rromani, mentioned, above, is, also, encountered, in, english, texts, the, term, roma, is, increasingly, encountered, as, a, generic, term, for, the, romani, because, not, all, romani, use, the, word, romani, as, an, adjective, the, term, became, a, noun, for, the, entire, ethnic, group, today, the, term, romani, is, used, by, some, organizations, including, the, united, nations, and, the, us, library, of, congress, however, the, council, of, europe, and, other, organizations, consider, that, roma, is, the, correct, term, referring, to, all, related, groups, regardless, of, their, country, of, origin, and, recommend, that, romani, be, restricted, to, the, language, and, culture, romani, language, romani, culture, the, united, kingdom, government, uses, the, term, roma, as, a, sub, group, of, white, in, its, ethnic, classification, system, the, standard, assumption, is, that, the, demonyms, of, the, romani, lom, and, dom, share, the, same, origin, the, english, exonym, gypsy, or, gipsy, originates, from, the, middle, english, gypcian, short, for, egipcien, the, spanish, term, gitano, and, french, gitan, have, similar, etymologies, they, are, ultimately, derived, from, the, greek, aigyptioi, meaning, egyptian, via, latin, this, designation, owes, its, existence, to, the, belief, common, in, the, middle, ages, that, the, romani, or, some, related, group, such, as, the, indian, dom, people, were, itinerant, egyptians, this, belief, appears, to, be, derived, from, verses, in, the, biblical, book, of, ezekiel, 29, 6, and, 12, 13, which, refer, to, the, egyptians, being, scattered, among, the, nations, by, an, angry, god, according, to, one, narrative, they, were, exiled, from, egypt, as, punishment, for, allegedly, harbouring, the, infant, jesus, in, his, book, the, zincali, an, account, of, the, gypsies, of, spain, george, borrow, notes, that, when, they, first, appeared, in, germany, it, was, under, the, character, of, egyptians, doing, penance, for, their, having, refused, hospitality, to, mary, and, her, son, as, described, in, victor, hugo, s, novel, the, hunchback, of, notre, dame, the, medieval, french, referred, to, the, romanies, as, gyptiens, these, exonyms, are, sometimes, written, with, capital, letter, to, show, that, they, designate, an, ethnic, group, however, the, word, is, often, considered, derogatory, because, of, its, negative, and, stereotypical, associations, the, council, of, europe, consider, that, gypsy, or, equivalent, terms, as, well, as, administrative, terms, such, as, gens, du, voyage, are, not, in, line, with, european, recommendations, in, britain, many, romani, proudly, identify, as, gypsies, and, as, part, of, the, gypsy, roma, and, traveller, grouping, this, is, the, name, used, to, describe, all, para, romani, groups, in, official, contexts, in, north, america, the, word, gypsy, is, most, commonly, used, as, a, reference, to, romani, ethnicity, though, lifestyle, and, fashion, are, at, times, also, referenced, by, using, this, word, another, designation, of, the, romani, is, cingane, alternatively, ingene, tsinganoi, zigar, zigeuner, tschingaren, likely, deriving, from, the, persian, word, chingane, derived, from, the, turkic, word, ga, meaning, poor, person, it, is, also, possible, that, the, origin, of, this, word, is, athinganoi, the, name, of, a, christian, sect, with, whom, the, romani, or, some, related, group, could, have, become, associated, in, the, past, there, is, no, official, or, reliable, count, of, the, romani, populations, worldwide, many, romani, refuse, to, register, their, ethnic, identity, in, official, censuses, for, a, variety, of, reasons, such, as, fear, of, discrimination, others, are, descendants, of, intermarriage, with, local, populations, some, who, no, longer, identify, only, as, romani, and, some, who, do, not, identify, as, romani, at, all, then, too, some, countries, do, not, collect, data, by, ethnicity, despite, these, challenges, to, getting, an, accurate, picture, of, the, romani, dispersal, there, were, an, estimated, 10, million, in, europe, as, of, 2019, although, some, romani, organizations, have, given, earlier, estimates, as, high, as, 14, million, significant, romani, populations, are, found, in, the, balkans, in, some, central, european, states, in, spain, france, russia, and, ukraine, in, the, european, union, there, are, an, estimated, 6, million, roma, outside, europe, there, may, be, several, million, more, romani, in, particular, in, the, middle, east, and, the, americas, the, romani, may, identify, as, distinct, ethnicities, based, in, part, on, territorial, cultural, and, dialectal, differences, and, self, designation, like, the, roma, in, general, many, different, ethnonyms, are, given, to, subgroups, of, roma, sometimes, a, subgroup, uses, more, than, one, endonym, is, commonly, known, by, an, exonym, or, erroneously, by, the, endonym, of, another, subgroup, the, only, name, approaching, an, all, encompassing, self, description, is, rom, even, when, subgroups, do, not, use, the, name, they, all, acknowledge, a, common, origin, and, a, dichotomy, between, themselves, and, gadjo, non, roma, for, instance, while, the, main, group, of, roma, in, german, speaking, countries, refer, to, themselves, as, sinti, their, name, for, their, original, language, is, romanes, subgroups, have, been, described, as, in, part, a, result, of, the, castes, and, subcastes, in, india, which, the, founding, population, of, rom, almost, certainly, experienced, in, their, south, asian, urheimat, many, groups, use, names, derived, from, the, romani, word, kalo, or, calo, meaning, black, or, absorbing, all, light, this, closely, resembles, words, for, black, or, dark, in, indo, aryan, languages, e, g, sanskrit, k, la, black, of, a, dark, colour, likewise, the, name, of, the, dom, or, domba, people, of, north, india, with, whom, the, roma, have, genetic, cultural, and, linguistic, links, has, come, to, imply, dark, skinned, in, some, indian, languages, hence, names, such, as, kale, and, cal, may, have, originated, as, an, exonym, or, a, euphemism, for, roma, other, endonyms, for, romani, include, for, example, the, roma, people, have, a, number, of, distinct, populations, the, largest, being, the, roma, who, reached, anatolia, and, the, balkans, about, the, early, 12th, century, from, a, migration, out, of, northwestern, india, beginning, about, 600, years, earlier, the, roma, migrated, throughout, europe, and, iberian, cal, or, cal, the, first, roma, to, come, to, the, united, states, arrived, in, virginia, georgia, new, jersey, and, louisiana, during, the, 1500s, romani, slaves, were, first, shipped, to, the, americas, with, columbus, in, 1498, spain, sent, romani, slaves, to, their, louisiana, colony, between, 1762, and, 1800, an, afro, romani, community, exists, in, st, martin, parish, due, to, intermarriage, of, freed, african, american, and, romani, slaves, the, roma, population, in, the, united, states, is, estimated, at, more, than, one, million, in, brazil, the, romani, are, mainly, called, ciganos, by, non, romani, brazilians, most, of, them, belong, to, the, ethnic, subgroup, cal, s, kale, of, the, iberian, peninsula, juscelino, kubitschek, brazil, s, president, from, 1956, to, 1961, was, 50, czech, romani, by, his, mother, s, bloodline, and, washington, lu, s, the, last, president, of, the, first, brazilian, republic, 1926, 1930, had, portuguese, kale, ancestry, persecution, against, the, romani, has, led, to, many, of, the, cultural, practices, being, extinguished, hidden, or, modified, to, survive, in, a, country, that, has, excluded, them, ethnically, and, culturally, the, very, common, carnivals, throughout, brazil, are, one, of, the, few, spaces, in, which, the, romani, can, still, express, their, cultural, traditions, including, the, so, called, carnival, wedding, in, which, a, boy, is, disguised, as, a, bride, and, the, famous, roman, dance, picturesquely, simulated, with, the, women, of, the, town, parading, in, their, traditional, attire, genetic, findings, show, an, indian, origin, for, roma, because, romani, groups, did, not, keep, chronicles, of, their, history, or, have, oral, accounts, of, it, most, hypotheses, about, early, romani, migration, are, based, on, linguistic, theory, according, to, a, legend, reported, in, the, persian, epic, poem, the, shahnameh, the, sasanian, king, bahr, m, v, g, r, learned, towards, the, end, of, his, reign, 421, 439, that, the, poor, could, not, afford, to, enjoy, music, and, so, he, asked, the, king, of, india, to, send, him, ten, thousand, luris, lute, playing, experts, when, the, luris, arrived, bahr, m, gave, each, one, an, ox, a, donkey, and, a, donkey, load, of, wheat, so, they, could, live, on, agriculture, and, play, music, for, free, for, the, poor, however, the, luris, ate, the, oxen, and, the, wheat, and, came, back, a, year, later, with, their, cheeks, hollowed, by, hunger, the, king, angered, with, their, having, wasted, what, he, had, given, them, ordered, them, to, pack, up, their, bags, and, go, wandering, around, the, world, on, their, donkeys, linguistic, evidence, has, indisputably, shown, that, the, roots, of, the, romani, language, lie, in, india, the, language, has, grammatical, characteristics, of, indian, languages, and, shares, with, them, a, large, part, of, the, basic, lexicon, romani, and, domari, share, some, similarities, agglutination, of, postpositions, of, the, second, layer, or, case, marking, clitics, to, the, nominal, stem, concord, markers, for, the, past, tense, the, neutralisation, of, gender, marking, in, the, plural, and, the, use, of, the, oblique, case, as, an, accusative, this, has, prompted, much, discussion, about, the, relationships, between, these, two, languages, domari, was, once, thought, to, be, a, sister, language, of, romani, the, two, languages, having, split, after, the, departure, from, the, indian, subcontinent, but, later, research, suggests, that, the, differences, between, them, are, significant, enough, to, treat, them, as, two, separate, languages, within, the, central, zone, hindustani, group, of, languages, the, dom, and, the, rom, therefore, likely, descend, from, two, migration, waves, from, india, separated, by, several, centuries, in, phonology, the, romani, language, shares, several, isoglosses, with, the, central, branch, of, indo, aryan, languages, especially, in, the, realization, of, some, sounds, of, the, old, indo, aryan, however, it, also, preserves, several, dental, clusters, in, regards, to, verb, morphology, romani, follows, exactly, the, same, pattern, of, northwestern, languages, such, as, kashmiri, and, shina, through, the, adoption, of, oblique, enclitic, pronouns, as, person, markers, lending, credence, to, the, theory, of, their, central, indian, origin, and, a, subsequent, migration, to, northwestern, india, though, the, retention, of, dental, clusters, suggests, a, break, from, central, languages, during, the, transition, from, old, to, middle, indo, aryan, the, overall, morphology, suggests, that, the, language, participated, in, some, of, the, significant, developments, leading, toward, the, emergence, of, new, indo, aryan, languages, the, following, table, presents, the, numerals, in, the, romani, domari, and, lomavren, languages, with, the, corresponding, terms, in, sanskrit, hindi, odia, and, sinhala, to, demonstrate, the, similarities, note, that, the, romani, numerals, 7, through, 9, have, been, borrowed, from, greek, genetic, findings, in, 2012, suggest, the, romani, originated, in, northwestern, india, and, migrated, as, a, group, according, to, the, study, the, ancestors, of, present, scheduled, caste, and, scheduled, tribe, populations, of, northern, india, traditionally, referred, to, collectively, as, the, oma, are, the, likely, ancestral, populations, of, modern, european, roma, in, december, 2012, additional, findings, appeared, to, confirm, that, the, roma, came, from, a, single, group, that, left, northwestern, india, about, 1, 500, years, ago, they, reached, the, balkans, about, 900, years, ago, and, then, spread, throughout, europe, the, team, also, found, that, the, roma, displayed, genetic, isolation, as, well, as, differential, gene, flow, in, time, and, space, with, non, romani, europeans, genetic, research, published, in, the, european, journal, of, human, genetics, has, revealed, that, over, 70, of, males, belong, to, a, single, lineage, that, appears, unique, to, the, roma, genetic, evidence, supports, the, medieval, migration, from, india, the, romani, have, been, described, as, a, conglomerate, of, genetically, isolated, founder, populations, while, a, number, of, common, mendelian, disorders, among, roma, from, all, over, europe, indicates, a, common, origin, and, founder, effect, a, 2020, whole, genome, study, confirmed, the, northwest, indian, origins, and, also, confirmed, substantial, balkan, and, middle, eastern, ancestry, a, study, from, 2001, by, gresham, et, al, suggests, a, limited, number, of, related, founders, compatible, with, a, small, group, of, migrants, splitting, from, a, distinct, caste, or, tribal, group, the, same, study, found, that, a, single, lineage, found, across, romani, populations, accounts, for, almost, one, third, of, romani, males, a, 2004, study, by, morar, et, al, concluded, that, the, romani, population, was, founded, approximately, 32, 40, generations, ago, with, secondary, and, tertiary, founder, events, occurring, approximately, 16, 25, generations, ago, haplogroup, h, m82, is, a, major, lineage, cluster, in, the, balkan, romani, group, accounting, for, approximately, 60, of, the, total, haplogroup, h, is, uncommon, in, europe, but, present, in, the, indian, subcontinent, and, sri, lanka, a, study, of, 444, people, representing, three, ethnic, groups, in, north, macedonia, found, mtdna, haplogroups, m5a1, and, h7a1a, were, dominant, in, romanies, 13, 7, and, 10, 3, respectively, y, dna, composition, of, muslim, romani, from, uto, orizari, municipality, in, north, macedonia, based, on, 57, samples, y, dna, haplogroup, h1a, occurs, in, romani, at, frequencies, 7, 70, unlike, ethnic, hungarians, among, hungarian, and, slovakian, romani, subpopulations, haplogroup, e, m78, and, i1, usually, occur, above, 10, and, sometimes, over, 20, while, among, slovakian, and, tiszavasvari, romani, the, dominant, haplogroup, is, h1a, among, tokaj, romani, it, is, haplogroup, j2a, 23, and, among, taktahark, ny, romani, it, is, haplogroup, i2a, 21, five, rather, consistent, founder, lineages, throughout, the, subpopulations, were, found, among, romani, j, m67, and, j, m92, j2, h, m52, h1a1, and, i, p259, i1, haplogroup, i, p259, as, h, is, not, found, at, frequencies, of, over, 3, among, host, populations, while, haplogroups, e, and, i, are, absent, in, south, asia, the, lineages, e, v13, i, p37, i2a, and, r, m17, r1a, may, represent, gene, flow, from, the, host, populations, bulgarian, romanian, and, greek, romani, are, dominated, by, haplogroup, h, m82, h1a1, while, among, spanish, romani, j2, is, prevalent, in, serbia, among, kosovo, and, belgrade, romani, haplogroup, h, prevails, while, among, vojvodina, romani, h, drops, to, 7, percent, and, e, v13, rises, to, a, prevailing, level, among, non, roma, europeans, haplogroup, h, is, extremely, rare, peaking, at, 7, among, albanians, from, tirana, and, 11, among, bulgarian, turks, it, occurs, at, 5, among, hungarians, although, the, carriers, might, be, of, romani, origin, among, non, roma, speaking, europeans, it, occurs, at, 2, among, slovaks, 2, among, croats, 1, among, macedonians, from, skopje, 3, among, macedonian, albanians, 1, among, serbs, from, belgrade, 3, among, bulgarians, from, sofia, 1, among, austrians, and, swiss, 3, among, romanians, from, ploie, ti, and, 1, among, turks, the, ottoman, occupation, of, the, balkans, also, left, a, significant, genetic, mark, on, the, y, dna, of, the, romani, there, creating, a, higher, frequency, of, haplogroups, j, and, e3b, in, roma, populations, from, the, region, a, full, genome, autosomal, dna, study, on, 186, roma, samples, from, europe, in, 2019, found, that, modern, roma, people, are, characterized, by, a, common, south, asian, origin, and, a, complex, admixture, from, balkan, middle, east, and, caucasus, derived, ancestries, the, autosomal, genetic, data, links, the, proto, roma, to, groups, in, northwest, india, specifically, punjabi, and, gujarati, samples, as, well, as, dravidian, speaking, groups, in, southeastern, india, specifically, irula, the, paternal, lineages, of, roma, are, most, common, in, southern, and, central, india, among, dravidian, speaking, populations, the, authors, argue, that, this, may, point, to, a, founder, effect, among, the, early, romani, during, their, ethnogenesis, or, shortly, after, they, migrated, out, of, the, indian, subcontinent, in, addition, they, theorized, of, a, possible, low, caste, dalit, origin, for, the, proto, roma, since, they, were, genetically, closer, to, the, punjabi, cluster, that, lacks, a, common, marker, characteristic, of, high, castes, which, is, west, euroasian, admixing, the, romani, may, have, emerged, from, what, is, the, modern, indian, state, of, rajasthan, migrating, to, the, northwest, the, punjab, region, of, the, indian, subcontinent, around, 250, bce, their, subsequent, westward, migration, possibly, in, waves, is, now, believed, to, have, occurred, beginning, in, about, 500, ce, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, emigration, from, india, may, have, taken, place, in, the, context, of, the, raids, by, mahmud, of, ghazni, as, these, soldiers, were, defeated, they, were, moved, west, with, their, families, into, the, byzantine, empire, the, author, ralph, lilley, turner, theorised, a, central, indian, origin, of, romani, followed, by, a, migration, to, northwest, india, as, it, shares, a, number, of, ancient, isoglosses, with, central, indo, aryan, languages, in, relation, to, realization, of, some, sounds, of, old, indo, aryan, this, is, lent, further, credence, by, its, sharing, exactly, the, same, pattern, of, northwestern, languages, such, as, kashmiri, and, shina, through, the, adoption, of, oblique, enclitic, pronouns, as, person, markers, the, overall, morphology, suggests, that, romani, participated, in, some, of, the, significant, developments, leading, toward, the, emergence, of, new, indo, aryan, languages, thus, indicating, that, the, proto, romani, did, not, leave, the, indian, subcontinent, until, late, in, the, second, half, of, the, first, millennium, the, first, romani, people, are, believed, to, have, arrived, in, europe, via, the, balkans, in, the, 13th, or, 14th, century, romani, people, began, migrating, to, other, parts, of, the, continent, during, the, 15th, and, 16th, centuries, in, february,

portugal, the, gitanos, of, spain, the, romanichal, of, the, uk, and, scandinavian, travellers, have, lost, their, knowledge, of, pure, romani, and, speak, the, mixed, languages, cal, angloromany, and, scandoromani, respectively, most, of, the, romani, language, speaking, communities, in, these, regions, consist, of, later, immigrants, from, eastern, or, central, europe, there, are, no, concrete, statistics, for, the, number, of, romani, speakers, both, in, europe, and, globally, however, a, conservative, estimate, is, 3, 5, million, speakers, in, europe, and, a, further, 500, 000, elsewhere, though, the, actual, number, may, be, considerably, higher, this, makes, romani, the, second, largest, minority, language, in, europe, behind, catalan, in, regards, to, the, diversity, of, dialects, romani, works, in, the, same, way, as, most, other, european, languages, cross, dialect, communication, is, dominated, by, the, following, features, one, of, the, most, enduring, persecutions, against, the, romani, was, their, enslavement, slavery, was, widely, practiced, in, medieval, europe, including, the, territory, of, present, day, romania, from, before, the, founding, of, the, principalities, of, moldavia, and, wallachia, in, the, 13th, 14th, centuries, legislation, decreed, that, all, the, romani, living, in, these, states, as, well, as, any, others, who, immigrated, there, were, classified, as, slaves, slavery, was, gradually, abolished, during, the, 1840s, and, 1850s, the, exact, origins, of, slavery, in, the, danubian, principalities, are, not, known, there, is, some, debate, over, whether, the, romani, came, to, wallachia, and, moldavia, as, free, men, or, were, brought, there, as, slaves, historian, nicolae, iorga, associated, the, roma, people, s, arrival, with, the, 1241, mongol, invasion, of, europe, and, he, also, considered, their, enslavement, a, vestige, of, that, era, in, which, the, romanians, took, the, roma, from, the, mongols, and, preserved, their, status, as, slaves, so, they, could, use, their, labor, other, historians, believe, that, the, romani, were, enslaved, while, they, were, being, captured, during, the, battles, with, the, tatars, the, practice, of, enslaving, prisoners, of, war, may, have, also, been, adopted, from, the, mongols, some, romani, may, have, been, slaves, of, the, mongols, or, the, tatars, or, they, may, have, served, as, auxiliary, troops, in, the, mongol, or, tatar, armies, however, most, of, them, migrated, from, south, of, the, danube, at, the, end, of, the, 14th, century, some, time, after, the, founding, of, wallachia, by, then, the, institution, of, slavery, was, already, established, in, moldavia, and, it, was, possibly, established, in, both, principalities, after, the, roma, migrated, into, the, area, slavery, became, a, widespread, practice, among, the, majority, of, the, population, the, tatar, slaves, smaller, in, numbers, were, eventually, merged, into, the, roma, population, some, branches, of, the, romani, reached, western, europe, in, the, 15th, century, fleeing, from, the, ottoman, conquest, of, the, balkans, as, refugees, although, the, romani, were, refugees, from, the, conflicts, in, southeastern, europe, they, were, often, suspected, of, being, associated, with, the, ottoman, invasion, by, certain, populations, in, the, west, because, their, physical, appearance, was, exotic, the, imperial, diet, at, landau, and, freiburg, in, 1496, 1498, declared, that, the, romani, were, spies, for, the, turks, in, western, europe, such, suspicions, and, discrimination, against, people, who, constituted, a, visible, minority, resulted, in, persecution, often, violent, with, attempts, to, commit, ethnic, cleansing, until, the, modern, era, in, times, of, social, tension, the, romani, suffered, as, scapegoats, for, instance, they, were, accused, of, bringing, the, plague, during, times, of, epidemics, on, 30, july, 1749, spain, conducted, the, great, roundup, of, romani, gitanos, in, its, territory, the, spanish, crown, ordered, a, nationwide, raid, that, led, to, the, break, up, of, families, because, all, able, bodied, men, were, interned, in, forced, labor, camps, in, an, attempt, to, commit, ethnic, cleansing, the, measure, was, eventually, reversed, and, the, romani, were, freed, as, protests, began, to, erupt, in, different, communities, sedentary, romani, were, highly, esteemed, and, protected, in, rural, spain, later, in, the, 19th, century, romani, immigration, was, forbidden, on, a, racial, basis, in, areas, outside, europe, mostly, in, the, english, speaking, world, in, 1880, argentina, prohibited, immigration, by, roma, as, did, the, united, states, in, 1885, in, the, habsburg, monarchy, under, maria, theresa, 1740, 1780, a, series, of, decrees, tried, to, integrate, the, romanies, to, get, them, to, permanently, settle, removed, their, rights, to, horse, and, wagon, ownership, 1754, to, reduce, citizen, mobility, renamed, them, new, citizens, and, obliged, romani, boys, into, military, service, just, as, any, other, citizens, were, if, they, had, no, trade, 1761, and, revision, 1770, required, them, to, register, with, the, local, authorities, 1767, and, another, decree, prohibited, marriages, between, romanies, 1773, to, integrate, them, into, the, local, population, her, successor, josef, ii, prohibited, the, wearing, of, traditional, romani, clothing, along, with, the, use, of, the, romani, language, both, of, which, were, punishable, by, flogging, during, this, time, the, schools, were, obliged, to, register, and, integrate, romani, children, this, policy, was, the, first, of, the, modern, policies, of, integration, in, spain, attempts, to, assimilate, the, gitanos, were, under, way, as, early, as, 1619, when, the, gitanos, were, forcibly, settled, the, use, of, the, romani, language, was, prohibited, gitano, men, and, women, were, sent, to, separate, workhouses, and, their, children, were, sent, to, orphanages, king, charles, iii, took, a, more, progressive, approach, to, gitano, assimilation, proclaiming, that, they, had, the, same, rights, as, spanish, citizens, and, ending, the, official, denigration, of, them, which, was, based, on, their, race, while, he, prohibited, their, nomadic, lifestyle, their, use, of, the, calo, language, the, manufacture, and, wearing, of, romani, clothing, their, trade, in, horses, and, other, itinerant, trades, he, also, forbade, any, form, of, discrimination, against, them, and, he, also, forbade, the, guilds, from, barring, them, the, use, of, the, word, gitano, was, also, forbidden, to, further, their, assimilation, it, was, replaced, with, new, castilian, a, designation, which, was, also, applied, to, former, jews, and, muslims, most, historians, believe, that, charles, iii, s, pragm, tica, failed, for, three, main, reasons, reasons, which, were, ultimately, derived, from, its, implementation, outside, major, cities, as, well, as, in, marginal, areas, the, difficulty, which, the, gitano, community, faced, in, changing, its, nomadic, lifestyle, the, marginal, lifestyle, to, which, the, community, had, been, driven, by, society, and, the, serious, difficulties, of, applying, the, pragm, tica, in, the, fields, of, education, and, work, one, author, ascribes, its, failure, to, the, overall, rejection, of, the, integration, of, the, gitanos, by, the, wider, population, other, policies, of, forced, assimilation, were, implemented, in, other, countries, one, of, these, countries, was, norway, where, a, law, which, permitted, the, state, to, remove, children, from, their, parents, and, place, them, in, state, institutions, was, passed, in, 1896, this, resulted, in, some, 1, 500, romani, children, being, taken, from, their, parents, in, the, 20th, century, during, world, war, ii, and, the, holocaust, the, persecution, of, the, romani, reached, a, peak, during, the, romani, holocaust, the, porajmos, the, genocide, which, was, perpetrated, against, them, by, nazi, germany, in, 1935, the, romani, who, lived, in, germany, lost, their, citizenship, when, it, was, stripped, from, them, by, the, nuremberg, laws, and, after, that, they, were, subjected, to, violence, and, imprisonment, in, concentration, camps, during, the, war, the, policy, was, extended, to, areas, under, german, occupation, and, it, was, also, implemented, by, other, axis, countries, most, notably, by, the, independent, state, of, croatia, romania, and, hungary, from, 1942, romani, were, subjected, to, genocide, in, extermination, camps, because, no, accurate, pre, war, census, figures, exist, for, the, romani, the, actual, number, of, romani, victims, who, were, killed, in, the, romani, holocaust, cannot, be, assessed, most, estimates, of, the, number, of, romani, victims, who, were, killed, in, the, romani, holocaust, range, from, 200, 000, to, 500, 000, but, other, estimates, vary, broadly, from, 90, 000, to, as, high, as, 4, 000, 000, lower, estimates, do, not, include, those, roma, who, were, killed, in, all, axis, controlled, countries, a, detailed, study, by, sybil, milton, a, former, senior, historian, at, the, u, s, holocaust, memorial, museum, contained, an, estimate, of, at, least, 220, 000, possibly, as, many, as, 500, 000, ian, hancock, director, of, the, program, of, romani, studies, and, the, romani, archives, and, documentation, center, at, the, university, of, texas, at, austin, argues, in, favour, of, a, higher, figure, of, between, 500, 000, and, 1, 500, 000, in, europe, romani, are, associated, with, poverty, high, crime, rates, and, behavior, that, is, considered, antisocial, or, inappropriate, by, the, rest, of, the, european, population, partly, for, this, reason, discrimination, against, the, romani, has, continued, to, be, practiced, to, the, present, day, although, efforts, are, being, made, to, address, it, amnesty,
