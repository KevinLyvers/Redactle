nationalism, and, sometimes, cultural, nationalism, an, excess, of, patriotism, is, called, chauvinism, another, related, term, is, jingoism, the, english, word, patriot, derived, from, compatriot, in, the, 1590s, from, middle, french, patriote, in, the, 15th, century, the, french, word, s, compatriote, and, patriote, originated, directly, from, late, latin, patriota, fellow, countryman, in,

either, uncivilized, or, primitive, and, who, had, only, a, common, patris, or, fatherland, the, original, european, meaning, of, patriots, applied, to, anyone, who, was, a, fellow, countryman, regardless, of, the, socio, economic, status, the, notions, of, civic, virtue, and, group, dedication, can, be, found, in, cultures, globally, throughout, history, for, enlightenment, thinkers, of, 18th, century, europe, loyalty, to, the, state, was, chiefly, considered, in, contrast, to, loyalty, to, the, church, it, was, argued, that, clerics, should, not, be, allowed, to, teach, in, public, schools, since, their, patrie, was, heaven, so, they, could, not, inspire, a, love, of, the, homeland, in, their, students, one, of, the, most, influential, proponents, of, this, notion, of, patriotism, was, jean, jacques, rousseau, enlightenment, thinkers, also, criticized, what, they, saw, as, the, excess, of, patriotism, in, 1774, samuel, johnson, published, the, patriot, a, critique, of, what, he, viewed, as, false, patriotism, on, the, evening, of, 7, april, 1775, he, made, the, famous, statement, patriotism, is, the, last, refuge, of, the, scoundrel, james, boswell, who, reported, this, comment, in, his, life, of, johnson, does, not, provide, context, for, the, quote, and, it, has, therefore, been, argued, that, johnson, was, in, fact, attacking, a, false, use, of, patriotism, by, contemporaries, such, as, john, stuart, 3rd, earl, of, bute, the, patriot, minister, and, his, supporters, johnson, spoke, elsewhere, in, favor, of, what, he, considered, true, patriotism, however, there, is, no, direct, evidence, to, contradict, the, widely, held, belief, that, johnson, s, famous, remark, was, a, criticism, of, patriotism, itself, many, patriotic, people, take, pride, in, sharing, a, distinct, common, culture, believing, it, to, be, central, to, their, national, identity, and, unity, many, are, devoted, to, the, preservation, of, their, traditional, culture, and, encourage, cultural, assimilation, by, people, from, other, cultures, however, some, of, the, more, civic, forms, of, patriotism, tend, to, de, emphasize, ethnic, culture, in, favor, of, a, shared, political, culture, patriotism, may, be, strengthened, by, adherence, to, a, national, religion, a, civil, religion, or, even, a, theocracy, this, is, the, opposite, of, the, separation, of, church, and, state, demanded, by, the, enlightenment, thinkers, who, saw, patriotism, and, faith, as, similar, and, opposed, forces, michael, billig, and, jean, bethke, elshtain, both, argued, that, the, difference, between, patriotism, and, faith, is, difficult, to, discern, and, relies, largely, on, the, attitude, of, the, one, doing, the, labeling, christopher, heath, wellman, professor, of, philosophy, at, washington, university, in, st, louis, says, a, popular, view, of, the, patriotist, position, is, robust, obligations, to, compatriots, and, only, minimal, samaritan, responsibilities, to, foreigners, wellman, calls, this, position, patriotist, rather, than, nationalist, to, single, out, the, members, of, territorial, political, units, rather, than, cultural, groups, george, orwell, in, his, influential, essay, notes, on, nationalism, distinguished, patriotism, from, the, related, concept, of, nationalism, by, patriotism, i, mean, devotion, to, a, particular, place, and, a, particular, way, of, life, which, one, believes, to, be, the, best, in, the, world, but, has, no, wish, to, force, upon, other, people, patriotism, is, of, its, nature, defensive, both, militarily, and, culturally, nationalism, on, the, other, hand, is, inseparable, from, the, desire, for, power, the, abiding, purpose, of, every, nationalist, is, to, secure, more, power, and, more, prestige, not, for, himself, but, for, the, nation, or, other, unit, in, which, he, has, chosen, to, sink, his, own, individuality, voltaire, stated, that, it, is, lamentable, that, to, be, a, good, patriot, one, must, become, the, enemy, of, the, rest, of, mankind, arthur, schopenhauer, wrote, that, the, cheapest, sort, of, pride, is, national, pride, for, if, a, man, is, proud, of, his, own, nation, it, argues, that, he, has, no, qualities, of, his, own, of, which, a, person, can, be, proud, k, toku, sh, sui, a, famous, japanese, anarchist, of, the, late, 19th, early, 20th, century, devoted, a, large, section, of, his, widely, read, imperialism, monster, of, the, twentieth, century, to, a, condemnation, of, patriotism, 5, one, of, the, many, arguments, is, based, on, the, confucian, value, of, empathy, i, am, as, convinced, as, mencius, that, any, man, would, rush, without, hesitation, to, rescue, a, child, who, was, about, to, fall, into, a, well, a, human, being, moved, by, such, selfless, love, and, charity, does, not, pause, to, think, whether, the, child, is, a, family, member, or, a, close, relative, when, he, rescues, the, child, from, danger, he, does, not, even, ask, himself, whether, the, child, is, his, own, or, belongs, to, another, 143, patriotism, is, used, to, dehumanize, others, whom, we, would, naturally, have, empathy, for, he, argues, atriotism, is, a, discriminating, and, arbitrary, sentiment, confined, to, those, who, belong, to, a, single, nation, state, or, live, together, within, common, national, borders, 59, a, sentiment, cultivated, and, used, by, militarists, in, their, drive, for, war, marxists, have, taken, various, stances, regarding, patriotism, on, one, hand, karl, marx, famously, stated, that, the, working, men, have, no, country, and, that, the, supremacy, of, the, proletariat, will, cause, to, vanish, still, faster, the, same, view, is, promoted, by, present, day, trotskyists, such, as, alan, woods, who, is, in, favor, of, tearing, down, all, frontiers, and, creating, a, socialist, world, commonwealth, on, the, other, hand, marxist, leninists, and, maoists, are, usually, in, favor, of, socialist, patriotism, based, on, the, theory, of, socialism, in, one, country, against, primordial, arguments, in, favour, of, national, patriotism, eric, hobsbawm, wrote, that, such, a, concept, was, for, most, of, human, history, so, remote, from, the, real, experience, of, most, human, beings, anarchists, oppose, patriotism, this, was, exemplified, by, emma, goldman, who, stated, indeed, conceit, arrogance, and, egotism, are, the, essentials, of, patriotism, let, me, illustrate, patriotism, assumes, that, our, globe, is, divided, into, little, spots, each, one, surrounded, by, an, iron, gate, those, who, have, had, the, fortune, of, being, born, on, some, particular, spot, consider, themselves, better, nobler, grander, and, more, intelligent, than, the, living, beings, inhabiting, any, other, spot, it, is, therefore, the, duty, of, everyone, living, in, that, chosen, spot, to, fight, kill, and, die, in, an, attempt, to, impose, his, superiority, upon, all, the, others, in, the, european, union, thinkers, such, as, j, rgen, habermas, have, advocated, a, euro, patriotism, but, patriotism, in, europe, is, usually, directed, at, the, nation, state, and, more, often, than, not, coincides, with, euroscepticism, several, surveys, have, tried, to, measure, patriotism, such, as, the, correlates, of, war, project, which, found, some, correlation, between, war,
