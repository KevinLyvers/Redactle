although, the, laws, are, often, poorly, enforced, since, 2010, the, united, nations, has, called, upon, healthcare, providers, to, stop, performing, all, forms, of, the, procedure, including, reinfibulation, after, childbirth, and, symbolic, nicking, of, the, clitoral, hood, the, opposition, to, the, practice, is, not, without, its, critics, particularly, among, anthropologists, who, have,

confusion, over, which, type, of, fgm, they, experienced, or, even, whether, they, experienced, it, studies, have, suggested, that, survey, responses, are, unreliable, a, 2003, study, in, ghana, found, that, in, 1995, four, percent, said, they, had, not, undergone, fgm, but, in, 2000, said, they, had, while, 11, percent, switched, in, the, other, direction, in, tanzania, in, 2005, 66, percent, reported, fgm, but, a, medical, exam, found, that, 73, percent, had, undergone, it, in, sudan, in, 2006, a, significant, percentage, of, infibulated, women, and, girls, reported, a, less,

while, adults, pull, her, legs, open, a, local, anaesthetic, is, applied, if, available, the, element, of, speed, and, surprise, is, vital, and, the, circumciser, immediately, grabs, the, clitoris, by, pinching, it, between, her, nails, aiming, to, amputate, it, with, a, slash, the, organ, is, then, shown, to, the, senior, female, relatives, of, the, child, who, will, decide, whether, the, amount, that, has, been, removed, is, satisfactory, or, whether, more, is, to, be, cut, off, after, the, clitoris, has, been, satisfactorily, amputated, the, circumciser, can, proceed, with, the, total, removal, of, the, labia, minora, and, the, paring, of, the, inner, walls, of, the, labia, majora, since, the, entire, skin, on, the, inner, walls, of, the, labia, majora, has, to, be, removed, all, the, way, down, to, the, perineum, this, becomes, a, messy, business, by, now, the, child, is, screaming, struggling, and, bleeding, profusely, which, makes, it, difficult, for, the, circumciser, to, hold, with, bare, fingers, and, nails, the, slippery, skin, and, parts, that, are, to, be, cut, or, sutured, together, having, ensured, that, sufficient, tissue, has, been, removed, to, allow, the, desired, fusion, of, the, skin, the, circumciser, pulls, together, the, opposite, sides, of, the, labia, majora, ensuring, that, the, raw, edges, where, the, skin, has, been, removed, are, well, approximated, the, wound, is, now, ready, to, be, stitched, or, for, thorns, to, be, applied, if, a, needle, and, thread, are, being, used, close, tight, sutures, will, be, placed, to, ensure, that, a, flap, of, skin, covers, the, vulva, and, extends, from, the, mons, veneris, to, the, perineum, and, which, after, the, wound, heals, will, form, a, bridge, of, scar, tissue, that, will, totally,

over, 30, percent, of, women, with, gishiri, cuts, were, found, to, have, vesicovaginal, fistulae, holes, that, allow, urine, to, seep, into, the, vagina, fgm, harms, women, s, physical, and, emotional, health, throughout, their, lives, it, has, no, known, health, benefits, the, short, term, and, late, complications, depend, on, the, type, of, fgm, whether, the, practitioner, has, had, medical, training, and, whether, they, used, antibiotics, and, sterilized, or, single, use, surgical, instruments, in, the, case, of, type, iii, other, factors, include, how, small, a, hole, was, left, for, the, passage, of, urine, and, menstrual, blood, whether, surgical, thread, was, used, instead, of, agave, or, acacia, thorns, and, whether, the, procedure, was, performed, more, than, once,

healing, problems, wound, infection, a, 2014, systematic, review, of, 56, studies, suggested, that, over, one, in, ten, girls, and, women, undergoing, any, form, of, fgm, including, symbolic, nicking, of, the, clitoris, type, iv, experience, immediate, complications, although, the, risks, increased, with, type, iii, the, review, also, suggested, that, there, was, under, reporting, other, short, term, complications, include, fatal, bleeding, anaemia, urinary, infection, septicaemia, tetanus, gangrene, necrotizing, fasciitis, flesh, eating, disease, and, endometritis, it, is, not, known, how, many, girls, and, women, die, as, a, result, of, the, practice, because, complications, may, not, be, recognized, or, reported, the, practitioners, use, of, shared, instruments, is, thought, to, aid, the, transmission, of, hepatitis, b, hepatitis, c, and, hiv, although, no, epidemiological, studies, have, shown, this, late, complications, vary, depending, on, the, type, of, fgm, they, include, the, formation, of, scars, and, keloids, that, lead, to, strictures, and, obstruction, epidermoid, cysts, that, may, become, infected, and, neuroma, formation, growth, of, nerve, tissue, involving, nerves, that, supplied, the, clitoris, an, infibulated, girl, may, be, left, with, an, opening, as, small, as, 2, 3, mm, which, can, cause, prolonged, drop, by, drop, urination, pain, while, urinating, and, a, feeling, of, needing, to, urinate, all, the, time, urine, may, collect, underneath, the, scar, leaving, the, area, under, the, skin, constantly, wet, which, can, lead, to, infection, and, the, formation, of, small, stones, the, opening, is, larger, in, women, who, are, sexually, active, or, have, given, birth, by, vaginal, delivery, but, the, urethra, opening, may, still, be, obstructed, by, scar, tissue, vesicovaginal, or, rectovaginal, fistulae, can, develop, holes, that, allow, urine, or, faeces, to, seep, into, the, vagina, this, and, other, damage, to, the, urethra, and, bladder, can, lead, to, infections, and, incontinence, pain, during, sexual, intercourse, and, infertility, painful, periods, are, common, because, of, the, obstruction, to, the, menstrual, flow, and, blood, can, stagnate, in, the, vagina, and, uterus, complete, obstruction, of, the, vagina, can, result, in, hematocolpos, and, hematometra, where, the, vagina, and, uterus, fill, with, menstrual, blood, the, swelling, of, the, abdomen, and, lack, of, menstruation, can, resemble, pregnancy, asma, el, dareer, a, sudanese, physician, reported, in, 1979, that, a, girl, in, sudan, with, this, condition, was, killed, by, her, family, fgm, may, place, women, at, higher, risk, of, problems, during, pregnancy, and, childbirth, which, are, more, common, with, the, more, extensive, fgm, procedures, infibulated, women, may, try, to, make, childbirth, easier, by, eating, less, during, pregnancy, to, reduce, the, baby, s, size, 99, in, women, with, vesicovaginal, or, rectovaginal, fistulae, it, is, difficult, to, obtain, clear, urine, samples, as, part, of, prenatal, care, making, the, diagnosis, of, conditions, such, as, pre, eclampsia, harder, cervical, evaluation, during, labour, may, be, impeded, and, labour, prolonged, or, obstructed, third, degree, laceration, tears, anal, sphincter, damage, and, emergency, caesarean, section, are, more, common, in, infibulated, women, neonatal, mortality, is, increased, the, who, estimated, in, 2006, that, an, additional, 10, 20, babies, die, per, 1, 000, deliveries, as, a, result, of, fgm, the, estimate, was, based, on, a, study, conducted, on, 28, 393, women, attending, delivery, wards, at, 28, obstetric, centres, in, burkina, faso, ghana, kenya, nigeria, senegal, and, sudan, in, those, settings, all, types, of, fgm, were, found, to, pose, an, increased, risk, of, death, to, the, baby, 15, percent, higher, for, type, i, 32, percent, for, type, ii, and, 55, percent, for, type, iii, the, reasons, for, this, were, unclear, but, may, be, connected, to, genital, and, urinary, tract, infections, and, the, presence, of, scar, tissue, according, to, the, study, fgm, was, associated, with, an, increased, risk, to, the, mother, of, damage, to, the, perineum, and, excessive, blood, loss, as, well, as, a, need, to, resuscitate, the, baby, and, stillbirth, perhaps, because, of, a, long, second, stage, of, labour, according, to, a, 2015, systematic, review, there, is, little, high, quality, information, available, on, the, psychological, effects, of, fgm, several, small, studies, have, concluded, that, women, with, fgm, develop, anxiety, depression, and, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, feelings, of, shame, and, betrayal, can, develop, when, women, leave, the, culture, that, practices, fgm, and, learn, that, their, condition, is, not, the, norm, but, within, the, practicing, culture, they, may, view, their, fgm, with, pride, because, for, them, it, signifies, beauty, respect, for, tradition, chastity, and, hygiene, studies, on, sexual, function, have, also, been, small, a, 2013, meta, analysis, of, 15, studies, involving, 12, 671, women, from, seven, countries, concluded, that, women, with, fgm, were, twice, as, likely, to, report, no, sexual, desire, and, 52, percent, more, likely, to, report, dyspareunia, painful, sexual, intercourse, one, third, reported, reduced, sexual, feelings, according, to, the, unicef, international, fgm, rates, have, risen, significantly, in, recent, years, rising, from, an, estimated, 200, million, in, 2016, to, 230, million, in, 2024, with, progress, towards, its, abandonment, stalling, or, reversing, in, many, effected, countries, aid, agencies, define, the, prevalence, of, fgm, as, the, percentage, of, the, 15, 49, age, group, that, has, experienced, it, these, figures, are, based, on, nationally, representative, household, surveys, known, as, demographic, and, health, surveys, dhs, developed, by, macro, international, and, funded, mainly, by, the, united, states, agency, for, international, development, usaid, and, multiple, indicator, cluster, surveys, mics, conducted, with, financial, and, technical, help, from, unicef, these, surveys, have, been, carried, out, in, africa, asia, latin, america, and, elsewhere, roughly, every, five, years, since, 1984, and, 1995, respectively, the, first, to, ask, about, fgm, was, the, 1989, 1990, dhs, in, northern, sudan, the, first, publication, to, estimate, fgm, prevalence, based, on, dhs, data, in, seven, countries, was, written, by, dara, carr, of, macro, international, in, 1997, questions, the, women, are, asked, during, the, surveys, include, was, the, genital, area, just, nicked, cut, without, removing, any, flesh, was, any, flesh, or, something, removed, from, the, genital, area, was, your, genital, area, sewn, most, women, report, cut, some, flesh, removed, types, i, and, ii, type, i, is, the, most, common, form, in, egypt, and, in, the, southern, parts, of, nigeria, type, iii, infibulation, is, concentrated, in, northeastern, africa, particularly, djibouti, eritrea, somalia, and, sudan, in, surveys, in, 2002, 2006, 30, percent, of, cut, girls, in, djibouti, 38, percent, in, eritrea, and, 63, percent, in, somalia, had, experienced, type, iii, there, is, also, a, high, prevalence, of, infibulation, among, girls, in, niger, and, senegal, and, in, 2013, it, was, estimated, that, in, nigeria, three, percent, of, the, 0, 14, age, group, had, been, infibulated, the, type, of, procedure, is, often, linked, to, ethnicity, in, eritrea, for, example, a, survey, in, 2002, found, that, all, hedareb, girls, had, been, infibulated, compared, with, two, percent, of, the, tigrinya, most, of, whom, fell, into, the, cut, no, flesh, removed, category, fgm, is, mostly, found, in, what, gerry, mackie, called, an, intriguingly, contiguous, zone, in, africa, east, to, west, from, somalia, to, senegal, and, north, to,

and, girls, are, thought, to, be, living, with, fgm, in, those, 30, countries, the, highest, concentrations, among, the, 15, 49, age, group, are, in, somalia, 98, percent, guinea, 97, percent, djibouti, 93, percent, egypt, 91, percent, and, sierra, leone, 90, percent, as, of, 2013, 27, 2, million, women, had, undergone, fgm, in, egypt, 23, 8, million, in, ethiopia, and, 19, 9, million, in, nigeria, there, is, a, high, concentration, in, indonesia, where, according, to, unicef, type, i, clitoridectomy, and, type, iv, symbolic, nicking, are, practised, the, indonesian, ministry, of, health, and, indonesian, ulema, council, both, say, the, clitoris, should, not, be, cut, the, prevalence, rate, for, the, 0, 11, group, in, indonesia, is, 49, percent, 13, 4, million, 2, smaller, studies, or, anecdotal, reports, suggest, that, various, types, of, fgm, are, also, practised, in, various, circumstances, in, colombia, jordan, oman, palestine, saudi, arabia, malaysia, the, united, arab, emirates, india, and, among, kurdish, communities, in, iran, but, there, are, no, representative, data, on, the, prevalence, in, these, countries, as, of, 2023, unicef, reported, that, the, highest, levels, of, support, for, fgm, can, be, found, in, mali, sierra, leone, guinea, the, gambia, somalia, and, egypt, where, more, than, half, of, the, female, population, thinks, the, practice, should, continue, prevalence, figures, for, the, 15, 19, age, group, and, younger, show, a, downward, trend, for, example, burkina, faso, fell, from, 89, percent, 1980, to, 58, percent, 2010, egypt, from, 97, percent, 1985, to, 70, percent, 2015, and, kenya, from, 41, percent, 1984, to, 11, percent, 2014, beginning, in, 2010, household, surveys, asked, women, about, the, fgm, status, of, all, their, living, daughters, the, highest, concentrations, among, girls, aged, 0, 14, were, in, gambia, 56, percent, mauritania, 54, percent, indonesia, 49, percent, for, 0, 11, and, guinea, 46, percent, the, figures, suggest, that, a, girl, was, one, third, less, likely, in, 2014, to, undergo, fgm, than, she, was, 30, years, ago, according, to, a, 2018, study, published, in, bmj, global, health, the, prevalence, within, the, 0, 14, year, old, group, fell, in, east, africa, from, 71, 4, percent, in, 1995, to, 8, percent, in, 2016, in, north, africa, from, 57, 7, percent, in, 1990, to, 14, 1, percent, in, 2015, and, in, west, africa, from, 73, 6, percent, in, 1996, to, 25, 4, percent, in, 2017, if, the, current, rate, of, decline, continues, the, number, of, girls, cut, will, nevertheless, continue, to, rise, because, of, population, growth, according, to, unicef, in, 2014, they, estimate, that, the, figure, will, increase, from, 3, 6, million, a, year, in, 2013, to, 4, 1, million, in, 2050, surveys, have, found, fgm, to, be, more, common, in, rural, areas, less, common, in, most, countries, among, girls, from, the, wealthiest, homes, and, except, in, sudan, and, somalia, less, common, in, girls, whose, mothers, had, access, to, primary, or, secondary, higher, education, in, somalia, and, sudan, the, situation, was, reversed, in, somalia, the, mothers, access, to, secondary, higher, education, was, accompanied, by, a, rise, in, prevalence, of, fgm, in, their, daughters, and, in, sudan, access, to, any, education, was, accompanied, by, a, rise, fgm, is, not, invariably, a, rite, of, passage, between, childhood, and, adulthood, but, is, often, performed, on, much, younger, children, girls, are, most, commonly, cut, shortly, after, birth, to, age, 15, in, half, the, countries, for, which, national, figures, were, available, in, 2000, 2010, most, girls, had, been, cut, by, age, five, over, 80, percent, of, those, cut, are, cut, before, the, age, of, five, in, nigeria, mali, eritrea, ghana, and, mauritania, the, 1997, demographic, and, health, survey, in, yemen, found, that, 76, percent, of, girls, had, been, cut, within, two, weeks, of, birth, the, percentage, is, reversed, in, somalia, egypt, chad, and, the, central, african, republic, where, over, 80, percent, of, those, cut, are, cut, between, five, and, 14, just, as, the, type, of, fgm, is, often, linked, to, ethnicity, so, is, the, mean, age, in, kenya, for, example, the, kisi, cut, around, age, 10, and, the, kamba, at, 16, a, country, s, national, prevalence, often, reflects, a, high, sub, national, prevalence, among, certain, ethnicities, rather, than, a, widespread, practice, in, iraq, for, example, fgm, is, found, mostly, among, the, kurds, in, erbil, 58, percent, prevalence, within, age, group, 15, 49, as, of, 2011, sulaymaniyah, 54, percent, and, kirkuk, 20, percent, giving, the, country, a, national, prevalence, of, eight, percent, the, practice, is, sometimes, an, ethnic, marker, but, it, may, differ, along, national, lines, for, example, in, the, northeastern, regions, of, ethiopia, and, kenya, which, share, a, border, with, somalia, the, somali, people, practise, fgm, at, around, the, same, rate, as, they, do, in, somalia, but, in, guinea, all, fulani, women, responding, to, a, survey, in, 2012, said, they, had, experienced, fgm, against, 12, percent, of, the, fulani, in, chad, while, in, nigeria, the, fulani, are, the, only, large, ethnic, group, in, the, country, not, to, practise, it, in, sierra, leone, the, predominantly, christian,

mackie, has, compared, the, practice, to, footbinding, like, fgm, footbinding, was, carried, out, on, young, girls, nearly, universal, where, practised, tied, to, ideas, about, honour, chastity, and, appropriate, marriage, and, supported, and, transmitted, by, women, fgm, practitioners, see, the, procedures, as, marking, not, only, ethnic, boundaries, but, also, gender, differences, according, to, this, view, male, circumcision, defeminizes, men, while, fgm, demasculinizes, women, fuambai, ahmadu, an, anthropologist, and, member, of, the, kono, people, of, sierra, leone, who, in, 1992, underwent, clitoridectomy, as, an, adult, during, a, sande, society, initiation, argued, in, 2000, that, it, is, a, male, centred, assumption, that, the, clitoris, is, important, to, female, sexuality, african, female, symbolism, revolves, instead, around, the, concept, of, the, womb, infibulation, draws, on, that, idea, of, enclosure, and, fertility, enital, cutting, completes, the,

bound, within, the, male, body, is, unveiled, opened, and, exposed, in, communities, where, infibulation, is, common, there, is, a, preference, for, women, s, genitals, to, be, smooth, dry, and, without, odour, and, both, women, and, men, may, find, the, natural, vulva, repulsive, some, men, seem, to, enjoy, the, effort, of, penetrating, an, infibulation, the, local, preference, for, dry,

within, type, iv, fgm, because, the, added, friction, during, intercourse, can, cause, lacerations, and, increase, the, risk, of, infection, because, of, the, smooth, appearance, of, an, infibulated, vulva, there, is, also, a, belief, that, infibulation, increases, hygiene, common, reasons, for, fgm, cited, by, women, in, surveys, are, social, acceptance, religion, hygiene, preservation, of, virginity, marriageability, and, enhancement, of, male, sexual, pleasure, in, a, study, in, northern, sudan, published, in, 1983, only, 17, 4, percent, of, women, opposed, fgm, 558, out, of, 3, 210, and, most, preferred, excision, and, infibulation, over, clitoridectomy, attitudes, are, changing, slowly, in, sudan, in, 2010, 42, percent, of, women, who, had, heard, of, fgm, said, the, practice, should, continue, in, several, surveys, since, 2006, over, 50, percent, of, women, in, mali, guinea, sierra, leone, somalia, the, gambia, and, egypt, supported, fgm, s, continuance, while, elsewhere, in, africa, iraq, and, yemen, most, said, it, should, end, although, in, several, countries, only, by, a, narrow, margin, against, the, argument, that, women, willingly, choose, fgm, for, their, daughters, unicef, calls, the, practice, a, self, enforcing, social, convention, to, which, families, feel, they, must, conform, to, avoid, uncut, daughters, facing, social, exclusion, ellen,

respond, ya, mutmura, a, mutmara, was, a, storage, pit, for, grain, that, was, continually, opened, and, closed, like, an, infibulated, woman, but, despite, throwing, the, insult, back, the, zabarma, girls, would, ask, their, mothers, what, s, the, matter, don, t, we, have, razor, blades, like, the, arabs, because, of, poor, access, to, information, and, because, practitioners, downplay, the,

and, egypt, that, fgm, is, a, religious, requirement, gruenbaum, has, argued, that, practitioners, may, not, distinguish, between, religion, tradition, and, chastity, making, it, difficult, to, interpret, the, data, fgm, s, origins, in, northeastern, africa, are, pre, islamic, but, the, practice, became, associated, with, islam, because, of, that, religion, s, focus, on, female, chastity, and, seclusion, according, to, a, 2013, unicef, report, in, 18, african, countries, at, least, 10, percent, of, muslim, females, had, experienced, fgm, and, in, 13, of, those, countries, the, figure, rose, to, 50, 99, percent, in, 2007, the, al, azhar, supreme, council, of, islamic, research, in, cairo, ruled, that, fgm, had, no, basis, in, core, islamic, law, or, any, of, its, partial,

scholars, ab, d, w, d, and, a, mad, ibn, anbal, reported, that, muhammad, said, circumcision, was, a, law, for, men, and, a, preservation, of, honor, for, women, however, this, hadith, is, regarded, as, da, f, weak, fgm, is, regarded, as, an, obligatory, practice, by, the, shafi, i, version, of, sunni, islam, fgm, in, india, is, prevalent, among, the, shia, islam, members, of, the, bohra, muslim,

an, investigation, combining, contemporary, from, data, on, slave, shipments, from, 1400, to, 1900, with, data, from, 28, african, countries, has, found, that, women, belonging, to, ethnic, groups, historically, victimized, by, the, red, sea, slave, trade, were, significantly, more, likely, to, suffer, genital, mutilation, in, the, 21st, century, as, well, as, more, in, favour, of, continuing, the, practice, women, trafficked, in, the, red, sea, slave, trade, were, sold, as, concubines, sex, slaves, in, the, islamic, middle, east, up, until, as, late, as, in, the, mid, 20th, century, and, the, practice, of, infibulation, was, used, to, temporarily, signal, the, virginity, of, girls, increasing, their, value, on, the, slave, market, according, to, descriptions, by, early, travellers, infibulated, female, slaves, had, a, higher, price, on, the, market, because, infibulation, was, thought, to, ensure, chastity, and, loyalty, to, the, owner, and, prevented, undesired, pregnancies, mackie, cites, the, portuguese, missionary, jo, o, dos, santos, who, in, 1609, wrote, of, a, group, near, mogadishu, who, had, a, custome, to, sew, up, their, females, especially, their, slaves, being, young, to, make, them, unable, for, conception, which, makes, these, slaves, sell, dearer, both, for, their, chastitie, and, for, better, confidence, which, their, masters, put, in, them, thus,

institution, of, fgm, was, the, conditio, sine, qua, non, of, the, whole, teaching, of, tribal, law, religion, and, morality, no, proper, kikuyu, man, or, woman, would, marry, or, have, sexual, relations, with, someone, who, was, not, circumcised, he, wrote, a, woman, s, responsibilities, toward, the, tribe, began, with, her, initiation, her, age, and, place, within, tribal, history, were, traced, to, that, day, and, the, group, of, girls, with, whom, she, was, cut, was, named, according, to, current, events, an, oral, tradition, that, allowed, the, kikuyu, to, track, people, and, events, going, back, hundreds, of, years, beginning, with, the, csm, in, 1925, several, missionary, churches, declared, that, fgm, was, prohibited, for, african, christians, the, csm, announced, that, africans, practising, it, would, be, excommunicated, which, resulted, in, hundreds, leaving, or, being, expelled, in, 1929, the, kenya, missionary, council, began, referring, to, fgm, as, the, sexual, mutilation, of, women, and, a, person, s, stance, toward, the, practice, became, a, test, of, loyalty, either, to, the, christian, churches, or, to, the, kikuyu, central, association, the, stand, off, turned, fgm, into, a, focal, point, of, the, kenyan, independence, movement, the, 1929, 1931, period, is, known, in, the, country, s, historiography, as, the, female, circumcision, controversy, when, hulda, stumpf, an, american, missionary, who, opposed, fgm, in, the, girls, school, she, helped, to, run, was, murdered, in, 1930, edward, grigg, the, governor, of, kenya, told, the, british, colonial, office, that, the, killer, had, tried, to, circumcise, her, there, was, some, opposition, from, kenyan, women, themselves, at, the, mission, in, tumutumu, karatina, where, marion, scott, stevenson, worked, a, group, calling, themselves, ngo, ya, tuiritu, shield, of, young, girls, the, membership, of, which, included, raheli, warigia, mother, of, gakaara, wa, wanja, wrote, to, the, local, native, council, of, south, nyeri, on, 25, december, 1931, e, of, the, ngo, ya, tuiritu, heard, that, there, are, men, who, talk, of, female, circumcision, and, we, get, astonished, because, they, men, do, not, give, birth, and, feel, the, pain, and, even, some, die, and, even, others, become, infertile, and, the, main, cause, is, circumcision, because, of, that, the, issue, of, circumcision, should, not, be, forced, people, are, caught, like, sheep, one, should, be, allowed, to, cut, her, own, way, of, either, agreeing, to, be, circumcised, or, not, without, being, dictated, on, one, s, own, body, elsewhere, support, for, the, practice, from, women, was, strong, in, 1956, in, meru, eastern, kenya, when, the, council, of, male, elders, the, njuri, nchecke, announced, a, ban, on, fgm, in, 1956, thousands, of, girls, cut, each, other, s, genitals, with, razor, blades, over, the, next, three, years, as, a, symbol, of, defiance, the, movement, came, to, be, known, as, ngaitana, i, will, circumcise, myself, because, to, avoid, naming, their, friends, the, girls, said, they, had, cut, themselves, historian, lynn, thomas, described, the, episode, as, significant, in, the, history, of, fgm, because, it, made, clear, that, its, victims, were, also, its, perpetrators, fgm, was, eventually, outlawed, in, kenya, in, 2001, although, the, practice, continued, reportedly, driven, by, older, women, one, of, the, earliest, campaigns, against, fgm, began, in, egypt, in, the, 1920s, when, the, egyptian, doctors, society, called, for, a, ban, there, was, a, parallel, campaign, in, sudan, run, by, religious, leaders, and, british, women, infibulation, was, banned, there, in, 1946, but, the, law, was, unpopular, and, barely, enforced, the, egyptian, government, banned, infibulation, in, state, run, hospitals, in, 1959, but, allowed, partial, clitoridectomy, if, parents, requested, it, egypt, banned, fgm, entirely, in, 2007, in, 1959, the, un, asked, the, who, to, investigate, fgm, but, the, latter, responded, that, it, was, not, a, medical, matter, feminists, took, up, the, issue, throughout, the, 1970s, the, egyptian, physician, and, feminist, nawal, el, saadawi, criticized, fgm, in, her, book, women, and, sex, 1972, the, book, was, banned, in, egypt, and, el, saadawi, lost, her, job, as, director, general, of, public, health, she, followed, up, with, a, chapter, the, circumcision, of, girls, in, her, book, the, hidden, face, of, eve, women, in, the, arab, world, 1980, which, described, her, own, clitoridectomy, when, she, was, six, years, old, i, did, not, know, what, they, had, cut, off, from, my, body, and, i, did, not, try, to, find, out, i, just, wept, and, called, out, to, my, mother, for, help, but, the, worst, shock, of, all, was, when, i, looked, around, and, found, her, standing, by, my, side, yes, it, was, her, i, could, not, be, mistaken, in, flesh, and, blood, right, in, the, midst, of, these, strangers, talking, to, them, and, smiling, at, them, as, though, they, had, not, participated, in, slaughtering, her, daughter, just, a, few, moments, ago, in, 1975, rose, oldfield, hayes, an, american, social, scientist, became, the, first, female, academic, to, publish, a, detailed, account, of, fgm, aided, by, her, ability, to, discuss, it, directly, with, women, in, sudan, her, article, in, american, ethnologist, called, it, female, genital, mutilation, rather, than, female, circumcision, and, brought, it, to, wider, academic, attention, edna, adan, ismail, who, worked, at, the, time, for, the, somalia, ministry, of, health, discussed, the, health, consequences, of, fgm, in, 1977, with, the, somali, women, s, democratic, organization, two, years, later, fran, hosken, an, austrian, american, feminist, published, the, hosken, report, genital, and, sexual, mutilation, of, females, 1979, the, first, to, offer, global, figures, she, estimated, that, 110, 529, 000, women, in, 20, african, countries, had, experienced, fgm, the, figures, were, speculative, but, consistent, with, later, surveys, describing, fgm, as, a, training, ground, for, male, violence, hosken, accused, female, practitioners, of, participating, in, the, destruction, of, their, own, kind, the, language, caused, a, rift, between, western, and, african, feminists, african, women, boycotted, a, session, featuring, hosken,

france, the, reaction, was, that, westerners, ought, not, to, intervene, it, took, the, deaths, of, two, girls, in, 1982, one, of, them, three, months, old, for, that, attitude, to, change, in, 1991,

after, opening, her, for, childbirth, both, men, were, acquitted, in, 2015, anthropologists, have, accused, fgm, eradicationists, of, cultural, colonialism, and, have, been, criticized, in, turn, for, their, moral, relativism, and, failure, to, defend, the, idea, of, universal, human, rights, according, to, critics, of, the, eradicationist, position, the, biological, reductionism, of, the, opposition, to, fgm, and, the, failure, to, appreciate, fgm, s, cultural, context, serves, to, other, practitioners, and, undermine, their, agency, in, particular, when, parents, are, referred, to, as, mutilators, africans, who, object, to, the, tone, of, fgm, opposition, risk, appearing, to, defend, the, practice, the, feminist, theorist, obioma, nnaemeka, herself, strongly, opposed, to, fgm, argued, in, 2005, that, renaming, the, practice, female, genital, mutilation, had, introduced, a, subtext, of, barbaric, african, and, muslim, cultures, and, the, west, s, relevance, even, indispensability, in, purging, according, to, ugandan, law, professor, sylvia, tamale, the, early, western, opposition, to, fgm, stemmed, from, a, judeo, christian, judgment, that, african, sexual, and, family, practices, including, not, only, fgm, but, also, dry, sex, polygyny, bride, price, and, levirate, marriage, required, correction, african, feminists, take, strong, exception, to, the, imperialist, racist, and, dehumanising, infantilization, of, african, women, she, wrote, in, 2011, commentators, highlight, the, voyeurism, in, the, treatment, of, women, s, bodies, as, exhibits, examples, include, images, of, women, s, vulvas, after, fgm, or, girls, undergoing, the, procedure, the, 1996, pulitzer, prize, winning, photographs, of, a, 16, year, old, kenyan, girl, experiencing, fgm, were, published, by, 12, american, newspapers, without, her, consent, either, to, be, photographed, or, to, have, the, images, published, the, debate, has, highlighted, a, tension, between, anthropology, and, feminism, with, the, former, s, focus, on, tolerance, and, the, latter, s, on, equal, rights, for, women, according, to, the, anthropologist, christine, walley, a, common, position, in, anti, fgm, literature, has, been, to, present, african, women, as, victims, of, false, consciousness, participating, in, their, own, oppression, a, position, promoted, by, feminists, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, including, fran, hosken, mary, daly, and, hanny, lightfoot, klein, it, prompted, the, french, association, of, anthropologists, to, issue, a, statement, in, 1981, at, the, height, of, the, early, debates, that, a, certain, feminism, resuscitates, today, the, moralistic, arrogance, of, yesterday, s, colonialism, nnaemeka, argues, that, the, crucial, question, broader, than, fgm, is, why, the, female, body, is, subjected, to, so, much, abuse, and, indignity, including, in, the, west, several, authors, have, drawn, a, parallel, between, fgm, and, cosmetic, procedures, ron, n, conroy, of, the, royal, college, of, surgeons, in, ireland, wrote, in, 2006, that, cosmetic, genital, procedures, were, driving, the, advance, of, fgm, by, encouraging, women, to, see, natural, variations, as, defects, anthropologist, fadwa, el, guindi, compared, fgm, to, breast, enhancement, in, which, the, maternal, function, of, the, breast, becomes, secondary, to, men, s, sexual, pleasure, beno, te, groult, the, french, feminist, made, a, similar, point, in, 1975, citing, fgm, and, cosmetic, surgery, as, sexist, and, patriarchal, against, this, the, medical, anthropologist, carla, obermeyer, argued, in, 1999, that, fgm, may, be, conducive, to, a, subject, s, social, well, being, in, the, same, way, that, rhinoplasty, and, male, circumcision, are, despite, the, 2007, ban, in, egypt, egyptian, women, wanting, fgm, for, their, daughters, seek, amalyet, tajmeel, cosmetic, surgery, to, remove, what, they, see, as, excess, genital, tissue, cosmetic, procedures, such, as, labiaplasty, and, clitoral, hood, reduction, do, fall, within, the, who, s, definition, of, fgm, which, aims, to, avoid, loopholes, but, the, who, notes, that, these, elective, practices, are, generally, not, regarded, as, fgm, some, legislation, banning, fgm, such, as, in, canada, and, the, united, states, covers, minors, only, but, several, countries, including, sweden, and, the, united, kingdom, have, banned, it, regardless, of, consent, sweden, for, example, has, banned, operations, on, the, outer, female, sexual, organs, with, a, view, to, mutilating, them, or, bringing, about, some, other, permanent, change, in, them, regardless, of, whether, or, not, consent, has, been, given, for, the, operation, gynaecologist, birgitta, ess, n, and, anthropologist, sara, johnsdotter, argue, that, the, law, seems, to, distinguish, between, western, and, african, genitals, and, deems, only, african, women, such, as, those, seeking, reinfibulation, after, childbirth, unfit, to, make, their, own, decisions, the, philosopher, martha, nussbaum, argues, that, a, key, concern, with, fgm, is, that, it, is, mostly, conducted, on, children, using, physical, force, the, distinction, between, social, pressure, and, physical, force, is, morally, and, legally, salient, comparable, to, the, distinction, between, seduction, and, rape, she, argues, further, that, the, literacy, of, women, in, practising, countries, is, generally, poorer, than, in, developed, nations, which, reduces, their, ability, to, make, informed, choices, fgm, has, been, compared, to, other, procedures, that, modify, the, human, genitalia, conservatives, in, the, united, states, during, the, late, 2010s, and, early, 2020s, have, argued, that, fgm, is, similar, to, gender, affirming, surgery, for, transgender, individuals, which, has, led, to, bills, being, drafted, in, republican, states, equating, the, two, criticism, of, these, ideas, include, the, fact, that, the, gender, affirming, surgeries, are, approved, by, american, medical, authorities, are, rare, for, minors, and, are, done, after, reviews, by, multiple, medical, professionals, formerly, fgm, was, widely, referred, to, as, female, circumcision, in, the, academic, literature, but, this, was, rejected, by, international, medical, practitioners, because, it, suggests, a, fallacious, analogy, to, male, circumcision, it, has, been, argued, that, the, genital, alteration, of, intersex, infants, and, children, who, are, born, with, anomalies, that, physicians, choose, to, fix, is, analogous, to, fgm, who, 2008, common, tendency, to, describe, type, i, as, removal, of, the, prepuce, whereas, this, has, not, been, documented, as, a, traditional, form, of, female, genital, mutilation, however, in, some, countries, medicalized, female, genital, mutilation, can, include, removal, of, the, prepuce, only, type, ia, thabet, and, thabet, 2003, but, this, form, appears, to, be, relatively, rare, satti, et, al, 2006,
