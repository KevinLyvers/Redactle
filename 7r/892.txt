https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_conflict
an, ethnic, conflict, is, a, conflict, between, two, or, more, ethnic, groups, while, the, source, of, the, conflict, may, be, political, social, economic, or, religious, the, individuals, in, conflict, must, expressly, fight, for, their, ethnic, group, s, position, within, society, this, criterion, differentiates, ethnic, conflict, from, other, forms, of, struggle, academic, explanations, of, ethnic, conflict, generally, fall, into, one, of, three, schools, of, thought, primordialist, instrumentalist, or, constructivist, recently, some, have, argued, for, either, top, down, or, bottom, up, explanations, for, ethnic, conflict, intellectual, debate, has, also, focused, on, whether, ethnic, conflict, has, become, more, prevalent, since, the, end, of, the, cold, war, and, on, devising, ways, of, managing, conflicts, through, instruments, such, as, consociationalism, and, federalisation, it, is, argued, that, rebel, movements, are, more, likely, to, organize, around, ethnicity, because, ethnic, groups, are, more, apt, to, be, aggrieved, better, able, to, mobilize, and, more, likely, to, face, difficult, bargaining, challenges, compared, to, other, groups, the, causes, of, ethnic, conflict, are, debated, by, political, scientists, and, sociologists, official, academic, explanations, generally, fall, into, one, of, three, schools, of, thought, primordialist, instrumentalist, and, constructivist, more, recent, scholarship, draws, on, all, three, schools, proponents, of, primordialist, accounts, argue, that, thnic, groups, and, nationalities, exist, because, there, are, traditions, of, belief, and, action, towards, primordial, objects, such, as, biological, features, and, especially, territorial, location, primordialist, accounts, rely, on, strong, ties, of, kinship, among, members, of, ethnic, groups, donald, l, horowitz, argues, that, this, kinship, makes, it, possible, for, ethnic, groups, to, think, in, terms, of, family, resemblances, clifford, geertz, a, founding, scholar, of, primordialism, asserts, that, each, person, has, a, natural, connection, to, perceived, kinsmen, in, time, and, through, repeated, conflict, essential, ties, to, one, s, ethnicity, will, coalesce, and, will, interfere, with, ties, to, civil, society, ethnic, groups, will, consequently, always, threaten, the, survival, of, civil, governments, but, not, the, existence, of, nations, formed, by, one, ethnic, group, thus, when, considered, through, a, primordial, lens, ethnic, conflict, in, multi, ethnic, society, is, inevitable, a, number, of, political, scientists, argue, that, the, root, causes, of, ethnic, conflict, do, not, involve, ethnicity, per, se, but, rather, institutional, political, and, economic, factors, these, scholars, argue, that, the, concept, of, ethnic, war, is, misleading, because, it, leads, to, an, essentialist, conclusion, that, certain, groups, are, doomed, to, fight, each, other, when, in, fact, the, wars, between, them, that, occur, are, often, the, result, of, political, decisions, moreover, primordial, accounts, do, not, account, for, the, spatial, and, temporal, variations, in, ethnic, violence, if, these, ancient, hatreds, are, always, simmering, under, the, surface, and, are, at, the, forefront, of, people, s, consciousness, then, ethnic, groups, should, constantly, be, ensnared, in, violence, however, ethnic, violence, occurs, in, sporadic, outbursts, for, example, varshney, points, out, that, although, yugoslavia, broke, up, due, to, ethnic, violence, in, the, 1990s, it, had, enjoyed, a, long, peace, of, decades, before, the, ussr, collapsed, therefore, some, scholars, claim, that, it, is, unlikely, that, primordial, ethnic, differences, alone, caused, the, outbreak, of, violence, in, the, 1990s, primordialists, have, reformulated, the, ancient, hatreds, hypothesis, and, have, focused, more, on, the, role, of, human, nature, petersen, argues, that, the, existence, of, hatred, and, animosity, does, not, have, to, be, rooted, in, history, for, it, to, play, a, role, in, shaping, human, behavior, and, action, if, ancient, hatred, means, a, hatred, consuming, the, daily, thoughts, of, great, masses, of, people, then, the, ancient, hatreds, argument, deserves, to, be, readily, dismissed, however, if, hatred, is, conceived, as, a, historically, formed, schema, that, guides, action, in, some, situations, then, the, conception, should, be, taken, more, seriously, anthony, smith, notes, that, the, instrumentalist, account, came, to, prominence, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, in, the, united, states, in, the, debate, about, white, ethnic, persistence, in, what, was, supposed, to, have, been, an, effective, melting, pot, this, new, theory, sought, explained, persistence, as, the, result, of, the, actions, of, community, leaders, who, used, their, cultural, groups, as, sites, of, mass, mobilization, and, as, constituencies, in, their, competition, for, power, and, resources, because, they, found, them, more, effective, than, social, classes, in, this, account, of, ethnic, identification, ethnicity, and, race, are, viewed, as, instrumental, means, to, achieve, particular, ends, whether, ethnicity, is, a, fixed, perception, or, not, is, not, crucial, in, the, instrumentalist, accounts, moreover, the, scholars, of, this, school, generally, do, not, oppose, the, view, that, ethnic, difference, plays, a, part, in, many, conflicts, they, simply, claim, that, ethnic, difference, is, not, sufficient, to, explain, conflicts, mass, mobilization, of, ethnic, groups, can, only, be, successful, if, there, are, latent, ethnic, differences, to, be, exploited, otherwise, politicians, would, not, even, attempt, to, make, political, appeals, based, on, ethnicity, and, would, focus, instead, on, economic, or, ideological, appeals, for, these, reasons, it, is, difficult, to, completely, discount, the, role, of, inherent, ethnic, differences, additionally, ethnic, entrepreneurs, or, elites, could, be, tempted, to, mobilize, ethnic, groups, in, order, to, gain, their, political, support, in, democratizing, states, instrumentalists, theorists, especially, emphasize, this, interpretation, in, ethnic, states, in, which, one, ethnic, group, is, promoted, at, the, expense, of, other, ethnicities, furthermore, ethnic, mass, mobilization, is, likely, to, be, plagued, by, collective, action, problems, especially, if, ethnic, protests, are, likely, to, lead, to, violence, instrumentalist, scholars, have, tried, to, respond, to, these, shortcomings, for, example, russell, hardin, argues, that, ethnic, mobilization, faces, problems, of, coordination, and, not, collective, action, he, points, out, that, a, charismatic, leader, acts, as, a, focal, point, around, which, members, of, an, ethnic, group, coalesce, the, existence, of, such, an, actor, helps, to, clarify, beliefs, about, the, behavior, of, others, within, an, ethnic, group, a, third, constructivist, set, of, accounts, stress, the, importance, of, the, socially, constructed, nature, of, ethnic, groups, drawing, on, benedict, anderson, s, concept, of, the, imagined, community, proponents, of, this, account, point, to, rwanda, as, an, example, because, the, tutsi, hutu, distinction, was, codified, by, the, belgian, colonial, power, in, the, 1930s, on, the, basis, of, cattle, ownership, physical, measurements, and, church, records, identity, cards, were, issued, on, this, basis, and, these, documents, played, a, key, role, in, the, genocide, of, 1994, some, argue, that, constructivist, narratives, of, historical, master, cleavages, are, unable, to, account, for, local, and, regional, variations, in, ethnic, violence, for, example, varshney, highlights, that, in, the, 1960s, racial, violence, in, the, usa, was, heavily, concentrated, in, northern, cities, southern, cities, though, intensely, politically, engaged, did, not, have, riots, a, constructivist, master, narrative, is, often, a, country, level, variable, whereas, studies, of, incidences, of, ethnic, violence, are, often, done, at, the, regional, and, local, level, scholars, of, ethnic, conflict, and, civil, wars, have, introduced, theories, that, draw, insights, from, all, three, traditional, schools, of, thought, in, the, geography, of, ethnic, violence, monica, duffy, toft, shows, how, ethnic, group, settlement, patterns, socially, constructed, identities, charismatic, leaders, issue, indivisibility, and, state, concern, with, precedent, setting, can, lead, rational, actors, to, escalate, a, dispute, to, violence, even, when, doing, so, is, likely, to, leave, contending, groups, much, worse, off, such, research, addresses, empirical, puzzles, that, are, difficult, to, explain, using, primordialist, instrumentalist, or, constructivist, approaches, alone, as, varshney, notes, pure, essentialists, and, pure, instrumentalists, do, not, exist, anymore, one, of, the, most, debated, issues, relating, to, ethnic, conflict, is, whether, it, has, become, more, or, less, prevalent, in, the, post, cold, war, period, even, though, a, decline, in, the, rate, of, new, ethnic, conflicts, was, evident, in, the, late, 1990s, ethnic, conflict, remains, the, most, common, form, of, armed, intrastate, conflict, today, at, the, end, of, the, cold, war, academics, including, samuel, p, huntington, and, robert, d, kaplan, predicted, a, proliferation, of, conflicts, fueled, by, civilisational, clashes, tribalism, resource, scarcity, and, overpopulation, the, violent, ethnic, conflicts, in, nigeria, mali, sudan, and, other, countries, in, the, sahel, region, have, been, exacerbated, by, droughts, food, shortages, land, degradation, and, population, growth, however, some, theorists, contend, that, this, does, not, represent, a, rise, in, the, incidence, of, ethnic, conflict, because, many, of, the, proxy, wars, fought, during, the, cold, war, as, ethnic, conflicts, were, actually, hot, spots, of, the, cold, war, research, shows, that, the, fall, of, communism, and, the, increase, in, the, number, of, capitalist, states, were, accompanied, by, a, decline, in, total, warfare, interstate, wars, ethnic, wars, revolutionary, wars, and, the, number, of, refugees, and, displaced, persons, indeed, some, scholars, have, questioned, whether, the, concept, of, ethnic, conflict, is, useful, at, all, others, have, attempted, to, test, the, clash, of, civilisations, thesis, finding, it, to, be, difficult, to, operationalise, and, that, civilisational, conflicts, have, not, risen, in, intensity, in, relation, to, other, ethnic, conflicts, since, the, end, of, the, cold, war, a, key, question, facing, scholars, who, attempt, to, adapt, their, theories, of, interstate, violence, to, explain, or, predict, large, scale, ethnic, violence, is, whether, ethnic, groups, could, be, considered, rational, actors, prior, to, the, end, of, the, cold, war, the, consensus, among, students, of, large, scale, violence, was, that, ethnic, groups, should, be, considered, irrational, actors, or, semi, rational, at, best, if, true, general, explanations, of, ethnic, violence, would, be, impossible, in, the, years, since, however, scholarly, consensus, has, shifted, to, consider, that, ethnic, groups, may, in, fact, be, counted, as, rational, actors, and, the, puzzle, of, their, apparently, irrational, actions, for, example, fighting, over, territory, of, little, or, no, intrinsic, worth, must, therefore, be, explained, in, some, other, way, as, a, result, the, possibility, of, a, general, explanation, of, ethnic, violence, has, grown, and, collaboration, between, comparativist, and, international, relations, sub, fields, has, resulted, in, increasingly, useful, theories, of, ethnic, conflict, a, major, source, of, ethnic, conflict, in, multi, ethnic, democracies, is, over, the, access, to, state, patronage, conflicts, over, state, resources, between, ethnic, groups, can, increase, the, likelihood, of, ethnic, violence, in, ethnically, divided, societies, demand, for, public, goods, decreases, as, each, ethnic, group, derives, more, utility, from, benefits, targeted, at, their, ethnic, group, in, particular, these, benefits, would, be, less, valued, if, all, other, ethnic, groups, had, access, to, them, targeted, benefits, are, more, appealing, because, ethnic, groups, can, solidify, or, heighten, their, social, and, economic, status, relative, to, other, ethnic, groups, whereas, broad, programmatic, policies, will, not, improve, their, relative, worth, politicians, and, political, parties, in, turn, have, an, incentive, to, favor, co, ethnics, in, their, distribution, of, material, benefits, over, the, long, run, ethnic, conflict, over, access, to, state, benefits, is, likely, to, lead, to, the, ethnification, of, political, parties, and, the, party, system, as, a, whole, where, the, political, salience, of, ethnic, identity, increase, leading, to, a, self, fulfilling, equilibrium, if, politicians, only, distribute, benefits, on, an, ethnic, basis, voters, will, see, themselves, primarily, belonging, to, an, ethnic, group, and, view, politicians, the, same, way, they, will, only, vote, for, the, politician, belonging, to, the, same, ethnic, group, in, turn, politicians, will, refrain, from, providing, public, goods, because, it, will, not, serve, them, well, electorally, to, provide, services, to, people, not, belonging, to, their, ethnic, group, in, democratizing, societies, this, could, lead, to, ethnic, outbidding, and, lead, to, extreme, politicians, pushing, out, moderate, co, ethnics, patronage, politics, and, ethnic, politics, eventually, reinforce, each, other, leading, to, what, chandra, terms, a, patronage, democracy, the, existence, of, patronage, networks, between, local, politicians, and, ethnic, groups, make, it, easier, for, politicians, to, mobilize, ethnic, groups, and, instigate, ethnic, violence, for, electoral, gain, since, the, neighborhood, or, city, is, already, polarized, along, ethnic, lines, the, dependence, of, ethnic, groups, on, their, co, ethnic, local, politician, for, access, to, state, resources, is, likely, to, make, them, more, responsive, to, calls, of, violence, against, other, ethnic, groups, therefore, the, existence, of, these, local, patronage, channels, generates, incentives, for, ethnic, groups, to, engage, in, politically, motivated, violence, while, the, link, between, ethnic, heterogeneity, and, under, provision, of, public, goods, is, generally, accepted, there, is, little, consensus, around, the, causal, mechanism, underlying, this, relationship, to, identify, possible, causal, stories, humphreys, and, habyarimana, ran, a, series, of, behavioral, games, in, kampala, uganda, that, involved, several, local, participants, completing, joint, tasks, and, allocating, money, amongst, them, contrary, to, the, conventional, wisdom, they, find, that, participants, did, not, favor, the, welfare, of, their, co, ethnics, disproportionately, it, was, only, when, anonymity, was, removed, and, everyone, s, ethnicity, was, known, did, co, ethnics, decide, to, favor, each, other, humphreys, and, habyarimana, argue, that, cooperation, among, co, ethnics, is, primarily, driven, by, reciprocity, norms, that, tend, to, be, stronger, among, co, ethnics, the, possibility, of, social, sanctions, compelled, those, who, would, not, otherwise, cooperate, with, their, co, ethnics, to, do, so, the, authors, find, no, evidence, to, suggest, that, co, ethnics, display, a, greater, degree, of, altruism, towards, each, other, or, have, the, same, preferences, ethnic, cooperation, takes, place, because, co, ethnics, have, common, social, networks, and, therefore, can, monitor, each, other, and, can, threaten, to, socially, sanction, any, transgressors, in, the, early, twenty, first, century, the, online, social, networking, service, facebook, has, played, a, role, in, amplifying, ethnic, violence, in, the, rohingya, genocide, that, started, in, october, 2016, and, in, ethnic, violence, in, ethiopia, during, 2019, 2020, the, united, nations, human, rights, council, described, facebook, as, having, been, a, useful, instrument, for, those, seeking, to, spread, hate, and, complained, that, facebook, was, unable, to, provide, data, on, the, extent, of, its, role, in, the, genocide, during, 2019, 2020, posts, on, facebook, dominated, the, internet, in, ethiopia, and, played, a, major, role, in, encouraging, ethnic, violence, an, october, 2019, facebook, post, led, to, the, deaths, of, 70, people, in, ethiopia, in, mid, 2020, ethnic, tensions, in, ethiopia, were, amplified, by, online, hate, speech, on, facebook, that, followed, the, 29, june, assassination, of, hachalu, hundessa, the, hachalu, hundessa, riots, in, which, mobs, lynched, beheaded, and, dismembered, their, victims, took, place, with, almost, instant, and, widespread, sharing, of, hate, speech, and, incitement, to, violence, on, facebook, which, whipped, up, people, s, anger, according, to, david, gilbert, writing, in, vice, people, call, for, genocide, and, attacks, against, specific, religious, or, ethnic, groups, and, openly, post, photographs, of, burned, out, cars, buildings, schools, and, houses, according, to, network, against, hate, speech, an, ethiopian, citizens, group, berhan, taye, of, access, now, stated, that, in, ethiopia, offline, violence, quickly, leads, to, online, calls, for, ethnic, attacks, discrimination, and, destruction, of, property, goes, viral, he, stated, facebook, s, inaction, helps, propagate, hate, and, polarization, in, a, country, and, has, a, devastating, impact, on, the, narrative, and, extent, of, the, violence, a, number, of, scholars, have, attempted, to, synthesize, the, methods, available, for, the, resolution, management, or, transformation, of, their, ethnic, conflict, john, coakley, for, example, has, developed, a, typology, of, the, methods, of, conflict, resolution, that, have, been, employed, by, states, which, he, lists, as, indigenization, accommodation, assimilation, acculturation, population, transfer, boundary, alteration, genocide, and, ethnic, suicide, john, mcgarry, and, brendan, o, leary, have, developed, a, taxonomy, of, eight, macro, political, ethnic, conflict, regulation, methods, which, they, note, are, often, employed, by, states, in, combination, with, each, other, they, include, a, number, of, methods, that, they, note, are, clearly, morally, unacceptable, with, increasing, interest, in, the, field, of, ethnic, conflict, many, policy, analysts, and, political, scientists, theorized, potential, resolutions, and, tracked, the, results, of, institutional, policy, implementation, as, such, theories, often, focus, on, which, institutions, are, the, most, appropriate, for, addressing, ethnic, conflict, consociationalism, is, a, power, sharing, agreement, which, coopts, the, leaders, of, ethnic, groups, into, the, central, state, s, government, each, nation, or, ethnic, group, is, represented, in, the, government, through, a, supposed, spokesman, for, the, group, in, the, power, sharing, agreement, each, group, has, veto, powers, to, varying, degrees, dependent, on, the, particular, state, moreover, the, norm, of, proportional, representation, is, dominant, each, group, is, represented, in, the, government, in, a, percentage, that, reflects, the, ethnicity, s, demographic, presence, in, the, state, another, requirement, for, arend, lijphart, is, that, the, government, must, be, composed, of, a, grand, coalition, of, the, ethnic, group, leaders, which, supposes, a, top, down, approach, to, conflict, resolution, in, theory, this, leads, to, self, governance, and, protection, for, the, ethnic, group, many, scholars, maintain, that, since, ethnic, tension, erupts, into, ethnic, violence, when, the, ethnic, group, is, threatened, by, a, state, then, veto, powers, should, allow, the, ethnic, group, to, avoid, legislative, threats, switzerland, is, often, characterized, as, a, successful, consociationalist, state, a, recent, example, of, a, consociational, government, is, the, post, conflict, bosnian, government, that, was, agreed, upon, in, the, dayton, accords, in, 1995, a, tripartite, presidency, was, chosen, and, must, have, a, croat, a, serb, and, a, bosniak, the, presidents, take, turns, acting, as, the, forefront, executive, in, terms, of, 8, months, for, 4, years, many, have, credited, this, compromise, of, a, consociational, government, in, bosnia, for, the, end, of, the, violence, and, the, following, long, lasting, peace, in, contrast, to, lijphart, several, political, scientists, and, policy, analysts, have, condemned, consociationalism, one, of, the, many, critiques, is, that, consociationalism, locks, in, ethnic, tensions, and, identities, this, assumes, a, primordial, stance, that, ethnic, identities, are, permanent, and, not, subject, to, change, furthermore, this, does, not, allow, for, any, others, that, might, want, to, partake, in, the, political, process, as, of, 2012, a, jewish, bosnian, is, suing, the, bosnian, government, from, precluding, him, from, running, for, presidential, office, since, only, a, croat, serb, or, bosniak, can, run, under, the, consociational, government, determining, ethnic, identities, in, advance, and, implementing, a, power, sharing, system, on, the, basis, of, these, fixed, identities, is, inherently, discriminatory, against, minority, groups, that, might, be, not, be, recognized, moreover, it, discriminates, against, those, who, do, not, choose, to, define, their, identity, on, an, ethnic, or, communal, basis, in, power, sharing, systems, that, are, based, on, pre, determined, identities, there, is, a, tendency, to, rigidly, fix, shares, of, representation, on, a, permanent, basis, which, will, not, reflect, changing, demographics, over, time, the, categorization, of, individuals, in, particular, ethnic, groups, might, be, controversial, anyway, and, might, in, fact, fuel, ethnic, tensions, the, inherent, weaknesses, in, using, pre, determined, ethnic, identities, to, form, power, sharing, systems, has, led, ljiphart, to, argue, that, adopting, a, constructivist, approach, to, consociationalism, can, increase, its, likelihood, of, success, the, self, determination, of, ethnic, identities, is, more, likely, to, be, non, discriminatory, neutral, flexible, and, self, adjusting, for, example, in, south, africa, the, toxic, legacy, of, apartheid, meant, that, successful, consociation, could, only, be, built, on, the, basis, of, the, self, determination, of, groups, ljiphart, claims, that, because, ethnic, identities, are, often, unclear, fluid, and, flexible, self, determination, is, likely, to, be, more, successful, than, pre, determination, of, ethnic, groups, a, constructivist, approach, to, consociational, theory, can, therefore, strengthen, its, value, as, a, method, to, resolve, ethnic, conflict, another, critique, points, to, the, privileging, of, ethnic, identity, over, personal, political, choice, howard, has, deemed, consociationalism, as, a, form, of, ethnocracy, and, not, a, path, to, true, pluralistic, democracy, consociationalism, assumes, that, a, politician, will, best, represent, the, will, of, his, co, ethnics, above, other, political, parties, this, might, lead, to, the, polarization, of, ethnic, groups, and, the, loss, of, non, ethnic, ideological, parties, horowitz, has, argued, that, a, single, transferable, vote, system, could, prevent, the, ethnification, of, political, parties, because, voters, cast, their, ballots, in, order, of, preference, this, means, that, a, voter, could, cast, some, of, his, votes, to, parties, other, than, his, co, ethnic, party, this, in, turn, would, compel, political, parties, to, broaden, their, manifestos, to, appeal, to, voters, across, the, ethnic, divide, to, hoover, up, second, and, third, preference, votes, the, theory, of, implementing, federalism, in, order, to, curtail, ethnic, conflict, assumes, that, self, governance, reduces, demands, for, sovereignty, hechter, argues, that, some, goods, such, as, language, of, education, and, bureaucracy, must, be, provided, as, local, goods, instead, of, statewide, in, order, to, satisfy, more, people, and, ethnic, groups, some, political, scientists, such, as, stroschein, contend, that, ethnofederalism, or, federalism, determined, along, ethnic, lines, is, asymmetric, as, opposed, to, the, equal, devolution, of, power, found, in, non, ethnic, federal, states, such, as, the, united, states, in, this, sense, special, privileges, are, granted, to, specific, minority, groups, as, concessions, and, incentives, to, end, violence, or, mute, conflict, the, soviet, union, divided, its, structure, into, ethnic, federal, states, termed, union, republics, each, union, republic, was, named, after, a, titular, ethnic, group, who, inhabited, the, area, as, a, way, to, sovietize, nationalist, sentiments, during, the, 1920s, brubaker, asserts, that, these, titular, republics, were, formed, in, order, to, absorb, any, potential, elite, led, nationalist, movements, against, the, soviet, center, by, incentivizing, elite, loyalty, through, advancement, in, the, soviet, political, structure, thus, federalism, provides, some, self, governance, for, local, matters, in, order, to, satisfy, some, of, the, grievances, which, might, cause, ethnic, conflict, among, the, masses, moreover, federalism, brings, in, the, elites, and, ethnic, entrepreneurs, into, the, central, power, structure, this, prevents, a, resurgence, of, top, down, ethnic, conflict, nevertheless, after, the, fall, of, the, ussr, many, critiques, of, federalism, as, an, institution, to, resolve, ethnic, conflict, emerged, the, devolution, of, power, away, from, the, central, state, can, weaken, ties, to, the, central, state, moreover, the, parallel, institutions, created, to, serve, a, particular, nation, or, ethnic, group, might, provide, significant, resources, for, secession, from, the, central, state, as, most, states, are, unwilling, to, give, up, an, integral, portion, of, their, territory, secessionist, movements, may, trigger, violence, furthermore, some, competing, elite, political, players, may, not, be, in, power, they, would, remain, unincorporated, into, the, central, system, these, competing, elites, can, gain, access, through, federal, structures, and, their, resources, to, solidify, their, political, power, in, the, structure, according, to, v, p, gagnon, this, was, the, case, in, the, former, yugoslavia, and, its, disintegration, into, its, ethnic, federal, states, ethnic, entrepreneurs, were, able, to, take, control, of, the, institutionally, allocated, resources, to, wage, war, on, other, ethnic, groups, a, recent, theory, of, ethnic, tension, resolution, is, non, territorial, autonomy, or, nta, nta, has, emerged, in, recent, years, as, an, alternative, solution, to, ethnic, tensions, and, grievances, in, places, that, are, likely, to, breed, conflict, for, this, reason, nta, has, been, promoted, as, a, more, practical, and, state, building, solution, than, consociationalism, nta, alternatively, known, as, non, cultural, autonomy, nca, is, based, on, the, difference, of, jus, solis, and, jus, sanguinis, the, principles, of, territory, versus, that, of, personhood, it, gives, rights, to, ethnic, groups, to, self, rule, and, govern, matters, potentially, concerning, but, limited, to, education, language, culture, internal, affairs, religion, and, the, internally, established, institutions, needed, to, promote, and, reproduce, these, facets, in, contrast, to, federalism, the, ethnic, groups, are, not, assigned, a, titular, sub, state, but, rather, the, ethnic, groups, are, dispersed, throughout, the, state, unit, their, group, rights, and, autonomy, are, not, constrained, to, a, particular, territory, within, the, state, this, is, done, in, order, not, to, weaken, the, center, state, such, as, in, the, case, of, ethnofederalism, the, origin, of, nta, can, be, traced, back, to, the, marxists, works, of, otto, bauer, and, karl, renner, nta, was, employed, during, the, interwar, period, and, the, league, of, nations, sought, to, add, protection, clauses, for, national, minorities, in, new, states, in, the, 1920s, estonia, granted, some, cultural, autonomy, to, the, german, and, jewish, populations, in, order, to, ease, conflicts, between, the, groups, and, the, newly, independent, state, in, europe, most, notably, in, belgium, nta, laws, have, been, enacted, and, created, parallel, institutions, and, political, parties, in, the, same, country, in, belgium, nta, has, been, integrated, within, the, federal, consociational, system, some, scholars, of, ethnic, conflict, resolution, claim, that, the, practice, of, nta, will, be, employed, dependent, on, the, concentration, and, size, of, the, ethnic, group, asking, for, group, rights, other, scholars, such, as, clarke, argue, that, the, successful, implementation, of, nta, rests, on, the, acknowledgement, in, a, state, of, universal, principles, true, rule, of, law, established, human, rights, stated, guarantees, to, minorities, and, their, members, to, use, their, own, quotidien, language, religion, and, food, practices, and, a, framework, of, anti, discrimination, legislation, in, order, to, enforce, these, rights, moreover, no, individual, can, be, forced, to, adhere, identify, or, emphasize, a, particular, identity, such, as, race, gender, sexuality, etc, without, their, consent, in, order, for, nta, to, function, for, its, purpose, nonetheless, clarke, critiques, the, weaknesses, of, nta, in, areas, such, as, education, a, balance, between, society, wide, norms, and, intracommunity, values, policing, for, criminal, matters, and, public, safety, and, political, representation, which, limits, the, political, choices, of, an, individual, if, based, solely, on, ethnicity, furthermore, the, challenge, in, evaluating, the, efficacy, of, nta, lies, in, the, relatively, few, legal, implementations, of, nta, emphasizing, the, limits, of, approaches, that, focus, mainly, on, institutional, answers, to, ethnic, conflicts, which, are, essentially, driven, by, ethnocultural, dynamics, of, which, political, and, or, economic, factors, are, but, elements, gregory, paul, meyjes, urges, the, use, of, intercultural, communication, and, cultural, rights, based, negotiations, as, tools, with, which, to, effectively, and, sustainably, address, inter, ethnic, strife, meyjes, argues, that, to, fully, grasp, preempt, and, or, resolve, such, conflicts, whether, with, or, without, the, aid, of, territorial, or, non, territorial, institutional, mechanism, s, a, cultural, rights, approach, grounded, in, intercultural, knowledge, and, skill, is, essential, institutionalist, arguments, for, resolving, ethnic, conflict, often, focus, on, national, level, institutions, and, do, not, account, for, regional, and, local, variation, in, ethnic, violence, within, a, country, despite, similar, levels, of, ethnic, diversity, in, a, country, some, towns, and, cities, have, often, found, to, be, especially, prone, to, ethnic, violence, for, example, ashutosh, varshney, in, his, study, of, ethnic, violence, in, india, argues, that, strong, inter, ethnic, engagement, in, villages, often, disincentivizes, politicians, from, stoking, ethnic, violence, for, electoral, gain, informal, interactions, include, joint, participation, in, festivals, families, from, different, communities, eating, together, or, allowing, their, children, to, play, with, one, another, every, day, engagement, between, ethnic, groups, at, the, village, level, can, help, to, sustain, the, peace, in, the, face, of, national, level, shocks, like, an, ethnic, riot, in, another, part, of, the, country, in, times, of, ethnic, tension, these, communities, can, quell, rumors, police, neighborhoods, and, come, together, to, resist, any, attempts, by, politicians, to, polarize, the, community, the, stronger, the, inter, ethnic, networks, are, the, harder, it, is, for, politicians, to, polarize, the, community, even, if, it, may, be, in, their, political, interest, to, do, so, in, cities, where, the, population, tends, to, be, much, higher, informal, interactions, between, ethnic, groups, might, not, be, sufficient, to, prevent, violence, this, is, because, many, more, links, are, needed, to, connect, everyone, and, therefore, it, is, much, more, difficult, to, form, and, strengthen, inter, ethnic, ties, in, cities, formal, inter, ethnic, associations, like, trade, unions, business, associations, and, professional, organizations, are, more, effective, in, encouraging, inter, ethnic, interactions, that, could, prevent, ethnic, violence, in, the, future, these, organizations, force, ethnic, groups, to, come, together, based, on, shared, economic, interests, that, overcomes, any, pre, existing, ethnic, differences, for, example, inter, ethnic, business, organizations, serve, to, connect, the, business, interests, of, different, ethnic, groups, which, would, increase, their, desire, to, maintain, ethnic, harmony, any, ethnic, tension, or, outbreak, of, violence, will, go, against, their, economic, interests, and, therefore, over, time, the, salience, of, ethnic, identity, diminishes, interactions, between, ethnic, groups, in, formal, settings, can, also, help, countries, torn, apart, by, ethnic, violence, to, recover, and, break, down, ethnic, divisions, paula, pickering, a, political, scientist, who, studies, peace, building, efforts, in, bosnia, finds, that, formal, workplaces, are, often, the, site, where, inter, ethnic, ties, are, formed, she, claims, that, mixed, workplaces, lead, to, repeated, inter, ethnic, interaction, where, norms, of, professionalism, compel, everyone, to, cooperate, and, to, treat, each, other, with, respect, making, it, easier, for, individuals, belonging, to, the, minority, group, to, reach, out, and, form, relationships, with, everyone, else, nevertheless, giuliano, s, research, in, russia, has, shown, that, economic, grievances, even, in, a, mixed, workplace, can, be, politicized, on, ethnic, lines
