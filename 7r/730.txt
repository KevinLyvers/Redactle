anger, also, known, as, wrath, uk, r, roth, or, rage, is, an, intense, emotional, state, involving, a, strong, uncomfortable, and, non, cooperative, response, to, a, perceived, provocation, hurt, or, threat, a, person, experiencing, anger, will, often, experience, physical, effects, such, as, increased, heart, rate, elevated, blood, pressure, and, increased, levels, of, adrenaline, and, noradrenaline, some, view, anger, as, an, emotion, that, triggers, part, of, the, fight, or, flight, response, anger, becomes, the, predominant, feeling, behaviorally, cognitively, and, physiologically, when, a, person, makes, the, conscious, choice, to, take, action, to, immediately, stop, the, threatening, behavior, of, another, outside, force, anger, can, have, many, physical, and, mental, consequences, the, external, expression, of, anger, can, be, found, in, facial, expressions, body, language, physiological, responses, and, at, times, public, acts, of, aggression, facial, expressions, can, range, from, inward, angling, of, the, eyebrows, to, a, full, frown, while, most, of, those, who, experience, anger, explain, its, arousal, as, a, result, of, what, has, happened, to, them, psychologists, point, out, that, an, angry, person, can, very, well, be, mistaken, because, anger, causes, a, loss, in, self, monitoring, capacity, and, objective, observability, modern, psychologists, view, anger, as, a, normal, natural, and, mature, emotion, experienced, by, virtually, all, humans, at, times, and, as, something, that, has, functional, value, for, survival, uncontrolled, anger, can, negatively, affect, personal, or, social, well, being, and, negatively, impact, those, around, them, while, many, philosophers, and, writers, have, warned, against, the, spontaneous, and, uncontrolled, fits, of, anger, there, has, been, disagreement, over, the, intrinsic, value, of, anger, the, issue, of, dealing, with, anger, has, been, written, about, since, the, times, of, the, earliest, philosophers, but, modern, psychologists, in, contrast, to, earlier, writers, have, also, pointed, out, the, possible, harmful, effects, of, suppressing, anger, three, types, of, anger, are, recognized, by, psychologists, anger, can, potentially, mobilize, psychological, resources, and, boost, determination, toward, correction, of, wrong, behaviors, promotion, of, social, justice, communication, of, negative, sentiment, and, redress, of, grievances, it, can, also, facilitate, patience, in, contrast, anger, can, be, destructive, when, it, does, not, find, its, appropriate, outlet, in, expression, anger, in, its, strong, form, impairs, one, s, ability, to, process, information, and, to, exert, cognitive, control, over, one, s, behavior, an, angry, person, may, lose, their, objectivity, empathy, prudence, or, thoughtfulness, and, may, cause, harm, to, themselves, or, others, there, is, a, sharp, distinction, between, anger, and, aggression, verbal, or, physical, direct, or, indirect, even, though, they, mutually, influence, each, other, while, anger, can, activate, aggression, or, increase, its, probability, or, intensity, it, is, neither, a, necessary, nor, a, sufficient, condition, for, aggression, extension, of, the, stimuli, of, the, fighting, reactions, at, the, beginning, of, life, the, human, infant, struggles, indiscriminately, against, any, restraining, force, whether, it, be, another, human, being, or, a, blanket, which, confines, their, movements, there, is, no, inherited, susceptibility, to, social, stimuli, as, distinct, from, other, stimulation, in, anger, at, a, later, date, the, child, learns, that, certain, actions, such, as, striking, scolding, and, screaming, are, effective, toward, persons, but, not, toward, things, in, adults, though, the, infantile, response, is, still, sometimes, seen, the, fighting, reaction, becomes, fairly, well, limited, to, stimuli, whose, hurting, or, restraining, influence, can, be, thrown, off, by, physical, violence, brain, regions, which, are, activated, when, recognizing, threat, or, provocation, and, facilitate, autonomic, arousal, and, interoception, and, activate, the, stress, response, are, the, salience, network, dorsal, anterior, cingulate, cortex, and, anterior, insula, cortex, and, subcortical, area, the, thalamus, the, amygdala, and, the, brain, stem, raymond, novaco, of, university, of, california, irvine, who, since, 1975, has, published, a, plethora, of, literature, on, the, subject, stratified, anger, into, three, modalities, cognitive, appraisals, somatic, affective, tension, and, agitations, and, behavioral, withdrawal, and, antagonism, the, words, annoyance, and, rage, are, often, imagined, to, be, at, opposite, ends, of, an, emotional, continuum, mild, irritation, and, annoyance, at, the, low, end, and, fury, at, the, high, end, rage, problems, are, conceptualized, as, the, inability, to, process, emotions, or, life, s, experiences, either, because, the, capacity, to, regulate, emotion, schore, 1994, has, never, been, sufficiently, developed, or, because, it, has, been, temporarily, lost, due, to, more, recent, trauma, rage, is, understood, as, raw, undifferentiated, emotions, that, spill, out, when, another, life, event, that, cannot, be, processed, no, matter, how, trivial, puts, more, stress, on, the, organism, than, it, can, bear, anger, when, viewed, as, a, protective, response, or, instinct, to, a, perceived, threat, is, considered, as, positive, the, negative, expression, of, this, state, is, known, as, aggression, commits, antisocial, personality, disorder, and, intermittent, explosive, disorder, acting, on, this, misplaced, state, is, rage, due, to, possible, potential, errors, in, perception, and, judgment, examples, william, defoore, an, anger, management, writer, described, anger, as, a, pressure, cooker, stating, that, we, can, only, suppress, or, apply, pressure, against, our, happy, for, so, long, before, it, erupts, one, simple, trichotomy, of, anger, expression, is, passive, anger, versus, aggressive, anger, versus, assertive, anger, these, three, types, of, anger, have, some, characteristic, symptoms, passive, anger, can, be, expressed, in, the, following, ways, the, symptoms, of, aggressive, anger, are, anger, expression, can, take, on, many, more, styles, than, passive, or, aggressive, ephrem, fernandez, has, identified, six, dimensions, of, anger, expression, they, relate, to, the, direction, of, anger, its, locus, reaction, modality, impulsivity, and, objective, coordinates, on, each, of, these, dimensions, can, be, connected, to, generate, a, profile, of, a, person, s, anger, expression, style, among, the, many, profiles, that, are, theoretically, possible, in, this, system, are, the, familiar, profile, of, the, person, with, explosive, anger, profile, of, the, person, with, repressive, anger, profile, of, the, passive, aggressive, person, and, the, profile, of, constructive, anger, expression, much, research, has, explored, whether, the, emotion, of, anger, is, experienced, and, expressed, differently, depending, on, the, culture, matsumoto, 2007, conducted, a, study, in, which, white, american, and, asian, participants, needed, to, express, the, emotions, from, a, program, called, jacfee, japanese, and, caucasian, facial, expression, of, emotion, in, order, to, determine, whether, caucasian, observers, noticed, any, differences, in, expression, of, participants, of, a, different, nationality, he, found, that, participants, were, unable, to, assign, a, nationality, to, people, demonstrating, expression, of, anger, i, e, they, could, not, distinguish, ethnic, specific, expressions, of, anger, hatfield, rapson, and, le, 2009, conducted, a, study, that, measured, ethnic, differences, in, emotional, expression, using, participants, from, the, philippines, hawaii, china, and, europe, they, concluded, that, there, was, a, difference, between, how, someone, expresses, an, emotion, especially, the, emotion, of, anger, in, people, with, different, ethnicities, based, on, frequency, with, europeans, showing, the, lowest, frequency, of, expression, of, negative, emotions, other, research, investigates, anger, within, different, ethnic, groups, who, live, in, the, same, country, researchers, explored, whether, black, americans, experience, and, express, greater, anger, than, whites, mabry, kiecolt, 2005, they, found, that, after, controlling, for, sex, and, age, black, participants, did, not, feel, or, express, more, anger, than, whites, deffenbacher, and, swaim, 1999, compared, the, expression, of, anger, in, mexican, american, people, and, white, non, hispanic, american, people, they, concluded, that, white, non, hispanic, americans, expressed, more, verbal, aggression, than, mexican, americans, although, when, it, came, to, physical, aggression, expressions, there, was, no, significant, difference, between, both, cultures, when, it, came, to, anger, some, animals, make, loud, sounds, attempt, to, look, physically, larger, bare, their, teeth, and, stare, the, behaviors, associated, with, anger, are, designed, to, warn, aggressors, to, stop, their, threatening, behavior, rarely, does, a, physical, altercation, occur, without, the, prior, expression, of, anger, by, at, least, one, of, the, participants, displays, of, anger, can, be, used, as, a, manipulation, strategy, for, social, influence, people, feel, really, angry, when, they, sense, that, they, or, someone, they, care, about, has, been, offended, when, they, are, certain, about, the, nature, and, cause, of, the, angering, event, when, they, are, convinced, someone, else, is, responsible, and, when, they, feel, they, can, still, influence, the, situation, or, cope, with, it, for, instance, if, a, person, s, car, is, damaged, they, will, feel, angry, if, someone, else, did, it, e, g, another, driver, rear, ended, it, but, will, feel, sadness, instead, if, it, was, caused, by, situational, forces, e, g, a, hailstorm, or, guilt, and, shame, if, they, were, personally, responsible, e, g, they, crashed, into, a, wall, out, of, momentary, carelessness, psychotherapist, michael, c, graham, defines, anger, in, terms, of, our, expectations, and, assumptions, about, the, world, graham, states, anger, almost, always, results, when, we, are, caught, up, expecting, the, world, to, be, different, than, it, is, usually, those, who, experience, anger, explain, its, arousal, as, a, result, of, what, has, happened, to, them, and, in, most, cases, the, described, provocations, occur, immediately, before, the, anger, experience, such, explanations, confirm, the, illusion, that, anger, has, a, discrete, external, cause, the, angry, person, usually, finds, the, cause, of, their, anger, in, an, intentional, personal, and, controllable, aspect, of, another, person, s, behavior, this, explanation, is, based, on, the, intuitions, of, the, angry, person, who, experiences, a, loss, in, self, monitoring, capacity, and, objective, observability, as, a, result, of, their, emotion, anger, can, be, of, multicausal, origin, some, of, which, may, be, remote, events, but, people, rarely, find, more, than, one, cause, for, their, anger, according, to, novaco, anger, experiences, are, embedded, or, nested, within, an, environmental, temporal, context, disturbances, that, may, not, have, involved, anger, at, the, outset, leave, residues, that, are, not, readily, recognized, but, that, operate, as, a, lingering, backdrop, for, focal, provocations, of, anger, according, to, encyclop, dia, britannica, an, internal, infection, can, cause, pain, which, in, turn, can, activate, anger, according, to, cognitive, consistency, theory, anger, is, caused, by, an, inconsistency, between, a, desired, or, expected, situation, and, the, actually, perceived, situation, and, triggers, responses, such, as, aggressive, behavior, with, the, expected, consequence, of, reducing, the, inconsistency, sleep, deprivation, also, seems, to, be, a, cause, of, anger, anger, causes, a, reduction, in, cognitive, ability, and, the, accurate, processing, of, external, stimuli, dangers, seem, smaller, actions, seem, less, risky, ventures, seem, more, likely, to, succeed, and, unfortunate, events, seem, less, likely, angry, people, are, more, likely, to, make, risky, decisions, and, make, less, realistic, risk, assessments, in, one, study, test, subjects, primed, to, feel, angry, felt, less, likely, to, have, heart, disease, and, more, likely, to, receive, a, pay, raise, compared, to, fearful, people, this, tendency, can, manifest, in, retrospective, thinking, as, well, in, a, 2005, study, angry, subjects, said, they, thought, the, risks, of, terrorism, in, the, year, following, 9, 11, in, retrospect, were, low, compared, to, what, the, fearful, and, neutral, subjects, thought, in, inter, group, relationships, anger, makes, people, think, in, more, negative, and, prejudiced, terms, about, outsiders, anger, makes, people, less, trusting, and, slower, to, attribute, good, qualities, to, outsiders, when, a, group, is, in, conflict, with, a, rival, group, it, will, feel, more, anger, if, it, is, the, politically, stronger, group, and, less, anger, when, it, is, the, weaker, unlike, other, negative, emotions, like, sadness, and, fear, angry, people, are, more, likely, to, demonstrate, correspondence, bias, the, tendency, to, blame, a, person, s, behavior, more, on, his, nature, than, on, his, circumstances, they, tend, to, rely, more, on, stereotypes, and, pay, less, attention, to, details, and, more, attention, to, the, superficial, in, this, regard, anger, is, unlike, other, negative, emotions, such, as, sadness, and, fear, which, promote, analytical, thinking, an, angry, person, tends, to, anticipate, other, events, that, might, cause, them, anger, they, will, tend, to, rate, anger, causing, events, e, g, being, sold, a, faulty, car, as, more, likely, than, sad, events, e, g, a, good, friend, moving, away, a, person, who, is, angry, tends, to, place, more, blame, on, another, person, for, their, misery, this, can, create, a, feedback, as, this, extra, blame, can, make, the, angry, person, angrier, still, so, they, in, turn, place, yet, more, blame, on, the, other, person, when, people, are, in, a, certain, emotional, state, they, tend, to, pay, more, attention, to, or, remember, things, that, are, charged, with, the, same, emotion, so, it, is, with, anger, for, instance, if, a, person, is, trying, to, persuade, someone, that, a, tax, increase, is, necessary, if, the, person, is, currently, feeling, angry, they, would, do, better, to, use, an, argument, that, elicits, anger, more, criminals, will, escape, justice, than, say, an, argument, that, elicits, sadness, there, will, be, fewer, welfare, benefits, for, disabled, children, also, unlike, other, negative, emotions, which, focus, attention, on, all, negative, events, anger, only, focuses, attention, on, anger, causing, events, anger, can, make, a, person, more, desiring, of, an, object, to, which, his, anger, is, tied, in, a, 2010, dutch, study, test, subjects, were, primed, to, feel, anger, or, fear, by, being, shown, an, image, of, an, angry, or, fearful, face, and, then, were, shown, an, image, of, a, random, object, when, subjects, were, made, to, feel, angry, they, expressed, more, desire, to, possess, that, object, than, subjects, who, had, been, primed, to, feel, fear, as, with, any, emotion, the, display, of, anger, can, be, feigned, or, exaggerated, studies, by, hochschild, and, sutton, have, shown, that, the, show, of, anger, is, likely, to, be, an, effective, manipulation, strategy, in, order, to, change, and, design, attitudes, anger, is, a, distinct, strategy, of, social, influence, and, its, use, e, g, belligerent, behaviors, as, a, goal, achievement, mechanism, proves, to, be, a, successful, strategy, larissa, tiedens, known, for, her, studies, of, anger, claimed, that, expression, of, feelings, would, cause, a, powerful, influence, not, only, on, the, perception, of, the, expresser, but, also, on, their, power, position, in, the, society, she, studied, the, correlation, between, anger, expression, and, social, influence, perception, previous, researchers, such, as, keating, 1985, have, found, that, people, with, angry, face, expression, were, perceived, as, powerful, and, as, in, a, high, social, position, similarly, tiedens, et, al, have, revealed, that, people, who, compared, scenarios, involving, an, angry, and, a, sad, character, attributed, a, higher, social, status, to, the, angry, character, tiedens, examined, in, her, study, whether, anger, expression, promotes, status, attribution, in, other, words, whether, anger, contributes, to, perceptions, or, legitimization, of, others, behaviors, her, findings, clearly, indicated, that, participants, who, were, exposed, to, either, an, angry, or, a, sad, person, were, inclined, to, express, support, for, the, angry, person, rather, than, for, a, sad, one, in, addition, it, was, found, that, a, reason, for, that, decision, originates, from, the, fact, that, the, person, expressing, anger, was, perceived, as, an, ability, owner, and, was, attributed, a, certain, social, status, accordingly, showing, anger, during, a, negotiation, may, increase, the, ability, of, the, anger, expresser, to, succeed, in, negotiation, a, study, by, tiedens, et, al, indicated, that, the, anger, expressers, were, perceived, as, stubborn, dominant, and, powerful, in, addition, it, was, found, that, people, were, inclined, to, easily, give, up, to, those, who, were, perceived, by, them, as, powerful, and, stubborn, rather, than, soft, and, submissive, based, on, these, findings, sinaceur, and, tiedens, have, found, that, people, conceded, more, to, the, angry, side, rather, than, for, the, non, angry, one, a, question, raised, by, van, kleef, et, al, based, on, these, findings, was, whether, expression, of, emotion, influences, others, since, it, is, known, that, people, use, emotional, information, to, conclude, about, others, limits, and, match, their, demands, in, negotiation, accordingly, van, kleef, et, al, wanted, to, explore, whether, people, give, up, more, easily, to, an, angry, opponent, or, to, a, happy, opponent, findings, revealed, that, participants, tended, to, be, more, flexible, toward, an, angry, opponent, compared, with, a, happy, opponent, these, results, strengthen, the, argument, that, participants, analyze, the, opponent, s, emotion, to, conclude, about, their, limits, and, carry, out, their, decisions, accordingly, according, to, leland, r, beaumont, each, instance, of, anger, demands, making, a, choice, a, person, can, respond, with, hostile, action, including, overt, violence, or, they, can, respond, with, hostile, inaction, such, as, withdrawing, or, stonewalling, other, options, include, initiating, a, dominance, contest, harboring, resentment, or, working, to, better, understand, and, constructively, resolve, the, issue, according, to, raymond, novaco, there, are, a, multitude, of, steps, that, were, researched, in, attempting, to, deal, with, this, emotion, in, order, to, manage, anger, the, problems, involved, in, the, anger, should, be, discussed, novaco, suggests, the, situations, leading, to, anger, should, be, explored, by, the, person, conventional, therapies, for, anger, involve, restructuring, thoughts, and, beliefs, to, bring, about, a, reduction, in, anger, these, therapies, often, come, within, the, schools, of, cbt, or, cognitive, behavioral, therapy, like, modern, systems, such, as, rebt, rational, emotive, behavior, therapy, research, shows, that, people, with, excessive, anger, often, harbor, and, act, on, dysfunctional, attributions, assumptions, and, evaluations, in, specific, situations, it, has, been, shown, that, with, therapy, by, a, trained, professional, individuals, can, bring, their, anger, to, more, manageable, levels, the, therapy, is, followed, by, the, so, called, stress, inoculation, in, which, the, clients, are, taught, relaxation, skills, to, control, their, arousal, and, various, cognitive, controls, to, exercise, on, their, attention, thoughts, images, and, feelings, logic, defeats, anger, because, anger, even, when, it, s, justified, can, quickly, become, irrational, american, psychological, association, in, other, words, although, there, may, be, a, rational, reason, to, get, angry, the, frustrated, actions, of, the, subject, can, become, irrational, taking, deep, breaths, is, regarded, as, the, first, step, to, calming, down, once, the, anger, has, subsided, a, little, the, patient, will, accept, that, they, are, frustrated, and, move, on, lingering, around, the, source, of, frustration, may, bring, the, rage, back, the, skills, deficit, model, states, that, poor, social, skills, is, what, renders, a, person, incapable, of, expressing, anger, in, an, appropriate, manner, social, skills, training, has, been, found, to, be, an, effective, method, for, reducing, exaggerated, anger, by, offering, alternative, coping, skills, to, the, angry, individual, research, has, found, that, persons, who, are, prepared, for, aversive, events, find, them, less, threatening, and, excitatory, reactions, are, significantly, reduced, in, a, 1981, study, that, used, modeling, behavior, rehearsal, and, videotaped, feedback, to, increase, anger, control, skills, showed, increases, in, anger, control, among, aggressive, youth, in, the, study, research, conducted, with, youthful, offenders, using, a, social, skills, training, program, aggression, replacement, training, found, significant, reductions, in, anger, and, increases, in, anger, control, research, has, also, found, that, antisocial, personalities, are, more, likely, to, learn, avoidance, tasks, when, the, consequences, involved, obtaining, or, losing, tangible, rewards, learning, among, antisocial, personalities, also, occurred, better, when, they, were, involved, with, high, intensity, stimulation, social, learning, theory, states, that, positive, stimulation, was, not, compatible, with, hostile, or, aggressive, reactions, anger, research, has, also, studied, the, effects, of, reducing, anger, among, adults, with, antisocial, personality, disorder, aspd, with, a, social, skills, program, approach, that, used, a, low, fear, and, high, arousal, group, setting, this, research, found, that, low, fear, messages, were, less, provocative, to, the, aspd, population, and, high, positive, arousal, stimulated, their, ability, to, concentrate, and, subsequently, learn, new, skills, for, anger, reduction, a, new, integrative, approach, to, anger, treatment, has, been, formulated, by, fernandez, 2010, termed, cbat, for, cognitive, behavioral, affective, therapy, this, treatment, goes, beyond, conventional, relaxation, and, reappraisal, by, adding, cognitive, and, behavioral, techniques, and, supplementing, them, with, effective, techniques, to, deal, with, the, feeling, of, anger, the, techniques, are, sequenced, contingently, in, three, phases, of, treatment, prevention, intervention, and, postvention, in, this, way, people, can, be, trained, to, deal, with, the, onset, of, anger, its, progression, and, the, residual, features, of, anger, systematic, reviews, and, meta, analyses, suggest, that, certain, psychiatric, medications, may, be, effective, in, controlling, symptoms, of, anger, hostility, and, irritability, these, include, selective, serotonin, reuptake, inhibitor, ssri, antidepressants, like, sertraline, certain, anticonvulsant, mood, stabilizers, antipsychotics, like, aripiprazole, risperidone, and, olanzapine, and, benzodiazepines, like, midazolam, among, others, another, meta, analysis, of, antidepressants, and, aggression, found, no, change, in, aggression, in, adults, and, increased, aggression, in, children, psychostimulants, like, methylphenidate, and, amphetamines, as, well, as, the, atypical, antipsychotic, risperidone, are, useful, in, reducing, aggression, and, oppositionality, in, children, and, adolescents, with, attention, deficit, hyperactivity, disorder, adhd, antisocial, personality, disorder, and, autism, spectrum, disorder, with, moderate, to, large, effect, sizes, and, greater, effectiveness, than, other, studied, medications, yet, another, meta, analysis, found, that, methylphenidate, slightly, reduced, irritability, while, amphetamines, increased, the, risk, of, irritability, several, fold, in, children, with, adhd, other, research, has, found, no, impact, of, amphetamine, or, methamphetamine, on, aggression, in, humans, modern, psychologists, point, out, that, suppression, of, anger, may, have, harmful, effects, the, suppressed, anger, may, find, another, outlet, such, as, a, physical, symptom, or, become, more, extreme, john, w, fiero, cites, los, angeles, riots, of, 1992, as, an, example, of, sudden, explosive, release, of, suppressed, anger, the, anger, was, then, displaced, as, violence, against, those, who, had, nothing, to, do, with, the, matter, there, is, also, the, case, of, francine, hughes, who, suffered, 13, years, of, domestic, abuse, her, suppressed, anger, drove, her, to, kill, her, abuser, husband, it, is, claimed, that, a, majority, of, female, victims, of, domestic, violence, who, suppress, their, aggressive, feelings, are, unable, to, recognize, experience, and, process, negative, emotion, and, this, has, a, destabilising, influence, on, their, perception, of, agency, in, their, relationships, another, example, of, widespread, deflection, of, anger, from, its, actual, cause, toward, scapegoating, fiero, says, was, the, blaming, of, jews, for, the, economic, ills, of, germany, by, the, nazis, some, psychologists, criticized, the, catharsis, theory, of, aggression, which, suggests, that, releasing, pent, up, anger, reduces, aggression, on, the, other, hand, there, are, experts, who, maintain, that, suppression, does, not, eliminate, anger, since, it, merely, forbids, the, expression, of, anger, and, this, is, also, the, case, for, repression, which, merely, hides, anger, from, awareness, there, are, also, studies, that, link, suppressed, anger, and, medical, conditions, such, as, hypertension, coronary, artery, disease, and, cancer, suppressed, or, repressed, anger, is, found, to, cause, irritable, bowel, syndrome, eating, disorders, and, depression, among, women, suppression, is, also, referred, to, as, a, form, of, self, silencing, which, is, described, as, a, cognitive, activity, wherein, an, individual, monitors, the, self, and, eliminate, thoughts, and, feelings, that, are, perceived, to, be, dangerous, to, relationships, anger, suppression, is, also, associated, with, higher, rates, of, suicide, anger, expression, might, have, negative, outcomes, for, individuals, and, organizations, as, well, such, as, decrease, of, productivity, and, increase, of, job, stress, it, could, also, have, positive, outcomes, such, as, increased, work, motivation, improved, relationships, and, increased, mutual, understanding, for, ex, tiedens, 2000, a, dual, threshold, model, of, anger, in, organizations, by, geddes, and, callister, 2007, provides, an, explanation, on, the, valence, of, anger, expression, outcomes, the, model, suggests, that, organizational, norms, establish, emotion, thresholds, that, may, be, crossed, when, employees, feel, anger, the, first, expression, threshold, is, crossed, when, an, organizational, member, conveys, felt, anger, to, individuals, at, work, who, are, associated, with, or, able, to, address, the, anger, provoking, situation, the, second, impropriety, threshold, is, crossed, if, or, when, organizational, members, go, too, far, while, expressing, anger, such, that, observers, and, other, company, personnel, find, their, actions, socially, and, or, culturally, inappropriate, the, higher, probability, of, negative, outcomes, from, workplace, anger, likely, will, occur, in, either, of, two, situations, the, first, is, when, organizational, members, suppress, rather, than, express, their, anger, that, is, they, fail, to, cross, the, expression, threshold, in, this, instance, personnel, who, might, be, able, to, address, or, resolve, the, anger, provoking, condition, or, event, remain, unaware, of, the, problem, allowing, it, to, continue, along, with, the, affected, individual, s, anger, the, second, is, when, organizational, members, cross, both, thresholds, double, cross, displaying, anger, that, is, perceived, as, deviant, in, such, cases, the, angry, person, is, seen, as, the, problem, increasing, chances, of, organizational, sanctions, against, him, or, her, while, diverting, attention, away, from, the, initial, anger, provoking, incident, in, contrast, a, higher, probability, of, positive, outcomes, from, workplace, anger, expression, likely, will, occur, when, one, s, expressed, anger, stays, in, the, space, between, the, expression, and, impropriety, thresholds, here, one, expresses, anger, in, a, way, fellow, organizational, members, find, acceptable, prompting, exchanges, and, discussions, that, may, help, resolve, concerns, to, the, satisfaction, of, all, parties, involved, this, space, between, the, thresholds, varies, among, different, organizations, and, also, can, be, changed, in, organization, itself, when, the, change, is, directed, to, support, anger, displays, the, space, between, the, thresholds, will, be, expanded, and, when, the, change, is, directed, to, suppressing, such, displays, the, space, will, be, reduced, neuroscience, has, shown, that, emotions, are, generated, by, multiple, structures, in, the, brain, the, rapid, minimal, and, evaluative, processing, of, the, emotional, significance, of, the, sensory, data, is, done, when, the, data, passes, through, the, amygdala, in, its, travel, from, the, sensory, organs, along, certain, neural, pathways, towards, the, limbic, forebrain, emotion, caused, by, discrimination, of, stimulus, features, thoughts, or, memories, occurs, when, its, information, is, relayed, from, the, thalamus, to, the, neocortex, based, on, some, statistical, analysis, some, scholars, have, suggested, that, the, tendency, for, anger, may, be, genetic, distinguishing, between, genetic, and, environmental, factors, requires, further, research, and, actual, measurement, of, specific, genes, and, environments, in, neuroimaging, studies, of, anger, the, most, consistently, activated, region, of, the, brain, was, the, lateral, orbitofrontal, cortex, this, region, is, associated, with, approach, motivation, and, positive, affective, processes, the, external, expression, of, anger, can, be, found, in, physiological, responses, facial, expressions, body, language, and, at, times, in, public, acts, of, aggression, the, rib, cage, tenses, and, breathing, through, the, nose, becomes, faster, deeper, and, irregular, anger, activates, the, hypothalamic, pituitary, adrenal, axis, the, catecholamine, activation, is, more, strongly, norepinephrine, than, epinephrine, heart, rate, and, blood, pressure, increase, blood, flows, to, the, hands, perspiration, increases, particularly, when, the, anger, is, intense, the, face, flushes, the, nostrils, flare, the, jaw, tenses, the, brow, muscles, move, inward, and, downward, fixing, a, hard, stare, on, the, target, the, arms, are, raised, and, a, squared, off, stance, is, adopted, the, body, is, mobilized, for, immediate, action, often, manifesting, as, a, subjective, sense, of, strength, self, assurance, and, potency, this, may, encourage, the, impulse, to, strike, out, every, year, gallup, asks, people, in, over, 140, countries, did, you, experience, anger, during, a, lot, of, the, day, yesterday, in, 2021, gallup, found, that, 23, of, adults, experienced, a, lot, of, anger, which, is, up, from, 18, in, 2014, the, countries, that, experienced, the, most, anger, were, lebanon, turkey, armenia, iraq, and, afghanistan, the, countries, that, experience, the, least, anger, were, finland, mauritius, estonia, portugal, and, the, netherlands, the, most, common, way, to, measure, anger, has, been, through, the, use, of, self, report, measures, it, is, currently, thought, there, are, just, under, 50, measures, of, psychological, anger, the, spielberger, state, trait, anger, expression, inventory, and, the, novaco, anger, scale, and, provocation, inventory, are, widely, recognized, and, frequently, used, self, report, measures, for, assessing, anger, focusing, on, various, aspects, of, anger, expression, including, outward, inward, and, controlled, expressions, additionally, various, anger, scales, draw, on, different, perspectives, such, as, cognitive, processes, of, anger, rumination, anger, as, behavioral, and, cognitive, responses, to, avoidance, assertion, and, social, support, cognitive, and, emotional, aspects, of, irritability, functional, and, dysfunctional, responses, and, goal, oriented, behavior, in, response, to, anger, experiences, of, anger, and, positive, beliefs, about, anger, some, approaches, even, consider, anger, as, being, reciprocally, related, to, frustration, and, hostility, in, 2023, a, study, revealed, that, the, relationships, between, 46, subscales, of, publicly, available, self, report, measures, of, anger, suggest, five, primary, factors, these, factors, suggest, a, model, of, five, key, dimensions, to, anger, anger, arousal, anger, rumination, frustration, discomfort, anger, regulation, and, socially, constituted, anger, the, proposed, five, factor, model, is, based, on, various, theoretical, contexts, and, provides, a, useful, framework, for, examining, the, distinct, domains, of, anger, the, study, suggests, a, number, of, existing, subscales, that, can, be, used, to, measure, these, five, domains, of, anger, ancient, greek, philosophers, describing, and, commenting, on, the, uncontrolled, anger, particularly, toward, slaves, in, their, society, generally, showed, a, hostile, attitude, towards, anger, galen, and, seneca, regarded, anger, as, a, kind, of, madness, they, all, rejected, the, spontaneous, uncontrolled, fits, of, anger, and, agreed, on, both, the, possibility, and, value, of, controlling, anger, there, were, disagreements, regarding, the, value, of, anger, for, seneca, anger, was, worthless, even, for, war, seneca, believed, that, the, disciplined, roman, army, was, regularly, able, to, beat, the, germans, who, were, known, for, their, fury, he, argued, that, in, sporting, contests, it, is, a, mistake, to, become, angry, aristotle, on, the, other, hand, ascribed, some, value, to, anger, that, has, arisen, from, perceived, injustice, because, it, is, useful, for, preventing, injustice, furthermore, the, opposite, of, anger, is, a, kind, of, insensibility, aristotle, stated, the, difference, in, people, s, temperaments, was, generally, viewed, as, a, result, of, the, different, mix, of, qualities, or, humors, people, contained, seneca, held, that, red, haired, and, red, faced, people, are, hot, tempered, because, of, excessive, hot, and, dry, humors, ancient, philosophers, rarely, refer, to, women, s, anger, at, all, according, to, simon, kemp, and, k, t, strongman, perhaps, because, their, works, were, not, intended, for, women, some, of, them, that, discuss, it, such, as, seneca, considered, women, to, be, more, prone, to, anger, than, men, seneca, addresses, the, question, of, mastering, anger, in, three, parts, 1, how, to, avoid, becoming, angry, in, the, first, place, 2, how, to, cease, being, angry, and, 3, how, to, deal, with, anger, in, others, seneca, suggests, to, avoid, becoming, angry, in, the, first, place, that, the, many, faults, of, anger, should, be, repeatedly, remembered, one, should, avoid, being, too, busy, or, dealing, with, anger, provoking, people, unnecessary, hunger, or, thirst, should, be, avoided, and, soothing, music, be, listened, to, to, cease, being, angry, seneca, suggests, one, to, check, speech, and, impulses, and, be, aware, of, particular, sources, of, personal, irritation, in, dealing, with, other, people, one, should, not, be, too, inquisitive, it, is, not, always, soothing, to, hear, and, see, everything, when, someone, appears, to, slight, you, you, should, be, at, first, reluctant, to, believe, this, and, should, wait, to, hear, the, full, story, you, should, also, put, yourself, in, the, place, of, the, other, person, trying, to, understand, his, motives, and, any, extenuating, factors, such, as, age, or, illness, seneca, further, advises, daily, self, inquisition, about, one, s, bad, habit, to, deal, with, anger, in, others, seneca, suggests, that, the, best, reaction, is, to, keep, calm, a, certain, kind, of, deception, seneca, says, is, necessary, in, dealing, with, angry, people, galen, repeats, seneca, s, points, but, adds, a, new, one, finding, a, guide, and, teacher, can, help, the, person, in, controlling, their, passions, galen, also, gives, some, hints, for, finding, a, good, teacher, both, seneca, and, galen, and, later, philosophers, agree, that, the, process, of, controlling, anger, should, start, in, childhood, on, grounds, of, malleability, seneca, warns, that, this, education, should, not, blunt, the, spirit, of, the, children, nor, should, they, be, humiliated, or, treated, severely, at, the, same, time, they, should, not, be, pampered, children, seneca, says, should, learn, not, to, beat, their, playmates, and, not, to, become, angry, with, them, seneca, also, advises, that, children, s, requests, should, not, be, granted, when, they, are, angry, during, the, period, of, the, roman, empire, and, the, middle, ages, philosophers, elaborated, on, the, existing, conception, of, anger, many, of, whom, did, not, make, major, contributions, to, the, concept, for, example, many, medieval, philosophers, such, as, ibn, sina, avicenna, roger, bacon, and, thomas, aquinas, agreed, with, ancient, philosophers, that, animals, cannot, become, angry, on, the, other, hand, al, ghazali, algazel, who, often, disagreed, with, aristotle, and, ibn, sina, on, many, issues, argued, that, animals, do, possess, anger, as, one, of, the, three, powers, in, their, heart, the, other, two, being, appetite, and, impulse, he, also, argued, that, animal, will, is, conditioned, by, anger, and, appetite, in, contrast, to, human, will, which, is, conditioned, by, the, intellect, a, common, medieval, belief, was, that, those, prone, to, anger, had, an, excess, of, yellow, bile, or, choler, hence, the, word, choleric, this, belief, was, related, to, seneca, s, belief, that, red, haired, and, red, faced, people, are, hot, tempered, because, of, excessive, hot, and, dry, humors, wrath, was, sinful, because, of, the, social, problems, it, caused, sometimes, even, homicide, it, served, to, ignore, those, who, are, present, contradicts, those, who, are, absent, produces, insults, and, responds, harshly, to, insults, that, are, received, aristotle, felt, that, anger, or, wrath, was, a, natural, outburst, of, self, defense, in, situations, where, people, felt, they, had, been, wronged, aquinas, felt, that, if, anger, was, justified, it, was, not, a, sin, for, example, he, that, is, angry, without, cause, shall, be, in, danger, but, he, that, is, angry, with, cause, shall, not, be, in, danger, for, without, anger, teaching, will, be, useless, judgments, unstable, crimes, unchecked, therefore, to, be, angry, is, not, always, an, evil, the, concept, of, wrath, contributed, to, a, definition, of, gender, and, power, many, medieval, authors, in, 1200, agreed, the, differences, between, men, and, women, were, based, on, complexion, shape, and, disposition, complexion, involved, the, balance, of, the, four, fundamental, qualities, of, heat, coldness, moistness, and, dryness, when, various, combinations, of, these, qualities, are, made, they, define, groups, of, certain, people, as, well, as, individuals, hippocrates, aristotle, and, galen, all, agreed, on, that, in, terms, of, biology, and, sexual, differentiation, heat, was, the, most, important, of, the, qualities, because, it, determined, shape, and, disposition, disposition, included, a, balance, of, the, previous, four, qualities, the, four, elements, and, the, four, humors, for, example, the, element, of, fire, shared, the, qualities, of, heat, and, dryness, fire, dominated, in, yellow, bile, or, choler, meaning, a, choleric, person, was, more, or, hot, and, dry, than, others, hot, and, dry, individuals, were, active, dominant, and, aggressive, the, opposite, was, true, with, the, element, of, water, water, is, cold, and, moist, related, closely, to, phlegm, people, with, more, phlegmatic, personalities, were, passive, and, submissive, while, these, trait, clusters, varied, from, individual, to, individual, most, authors, in, the, middle, ages, assumed, certain, clusters, of, traits, characterized, men, more, than, women, and, vice, versa, scholars, posted, that, females, were, seen, by, authors, in, the, middle, ages, to, be, more, phlegmatic, cold, and, wet, than, males, meaning, females, were, more, sedentary, and, passive, than, males, women, s, passive, nature, appeared, natural, due, to, their, lack, of, power, when, compared, to, men, aristotle, identified, traits, he, believed, women, shared, female, feminine, passive, focused, on, matter, inactive, and, inferior, thus, medieval, women, were, supposed, to, act, submissively, toward, men, and, relinquish, control, to, their, husbands, hildegard, of, bingen, believed, women, were, fully, capable, of, anger, while, most, women, were, phlegmatic, individual, women, under, certain, circumstances, could, also, be, choleric, medieval, scholars, believed, most, men, were, choleric, or, hot, and, dry, thus, they, were, dominant, and, aggressive, barton, aristotle, also, identified, characteristics, of, men, male, masculine, active, focused, on, form, potent, outstanding, and, superior, men, were, aware, of, the, power, they, held, given, their, choleric, nature, men, exhibited, hot, temperatures, and, were, quick, to, anger, peter, of, albano, once, said, the, male, s, spirit, is, lively, given, to, violent, impulse, slow, getting, angry, and, slower, being, calmed, medieval, ideas, of, gender, assumed, men, were, more, rational, than, women, masculinity, involved, a, wide, range, of, possible, behaviors, and, men, were, not, angry, all, the, time, every, man, s, humoral, balance, was, different, some, men, were, strong, others, weak, also, some, more, prone, to, wrath, than, others, there, are, those, who, view, anger, as, a, manly, act, for, instance, david, brakke, maintained, because, anger, motivated, a, man, to, action, in, righting, wrongs, to, himself, and, others, because, its, opposite, appeared, to, be, passivity, in, the, face, of, challenges, from, other, males, because, to, put, it, simply, it, raised, the, body, s, temperature, anger, appeared, to, be, a, characteristic, of, masculinity, a, sign, that, a, man, was, indeed, a, manly, man, maimonides, considered, being, given, to, uncontrollable, passions, as, a, kind, of, illness, like, galen, maimonides, suggested, seeking, out, a, philosopher, for, curing, this, illness, just, as, one, seeks, out, a, physician, for, curing, bodily, illnesses, roger, bacon, elaborates, seneca, s, advices, many, medieval, writers, discuss, at, length, the, evils, of, anger, and, the, virtues, of, temperance, in, a, discussion, of, confession, john, mirk, an, english, 14th, century, augustinian, writer, tells, priests, how, to, advise, the, penitent, by, considering, the, spiritual, and, social, consequences, of, anger, agaynes, wra, e, hys, helpe, schal, be, ef, he, haue, grace, in, herte, to, se, how, aungelus,

hell, s, fury, burns, his, heart, and, makes, him, so, hot, and, high, that, none, may, stand, him, nigh, in, the, canon, of, medicine, ibn, sina, avicenna, modified, the, theory, of, temperaments, and, argued, that, anger, heralded, the, transition, of, melancholia, to, mania, and, explained, that, humidity, inside, the, head, can, contribute, to, such, mood, disorders, on, the, other, hand, ahmed, ibn, sahl, al, balkhi, classified, anger, along, with, aggression, as, a, type, of, neurosis, while, al, ghazali, argued, that, anger, takes, form, in, rage, indignation, and, revenge, and, that, the, powers, of, the, soul, become, balanced, if, it, keeps, anger, under, control, immanuel, kant, rejects, revenge, as, vicious, regarding, the, latter, david, hume, argues, that, because, anger, and, hatred, are, passions, inherent, in, our, very, frame, and, constitution, the, lack, of, them, is, sometimes, evidence, of, weakness, and, imbecility, martha, nussbaum, has, also, agreed, that, even, great, injustice, is, no, excuse, for, childish, and, undisciplined, behavior, two, main, differences, between, the, modern, understanding, and, ancient, understanding, of, anger, can, be, detected, kemp, and, strongman, state, one, is, that, early, philosophers, were, not, concerned, with, possible, harmful, effects, of, the, suppression, of, anger, the, other, is, that, recently, studies, of, anger, take, the, issue, of, gender, differences, into, account, soraya, chemaly, has, in, contrast, argued, that, anger, is, a, critically, useful, and, positive, emotion, which, warns, us, as, humans, that, something, is, wrong, and, needs, to, change, when, being, threatened, with, indignity, physical, harm, humiliation, and, unfairness, and, therefore, a, powerful, force, for, political, good, furthermore, she, argues, that, women, and, minorities, are, not, allowed, to, be, angry, to, the, same, extent, as, white, men, in, a, similar, vein, rebecca, traister, has, argued, that, holding, back, anger, has, been, an, impediment, to, the, progress, of, women, s, rights, the, american, psychologist, albert, ellis, has, suggested, that, anger, rage, and, fury, partly, have, roots, in, the, philosophical, meanings, and, assumptions, through, which, human, beings, interpret, transgression, according, to, ellis, these, emotions, are, often, associated, and, related, to, the, leaning, humans, have, to, absolutistically, depreciating, and, damning, other, peoples, humanity, when, their, personal, rules, and, domain, are, transgressed, in, judaism, anger, is, a, negative, trait, in, the, book, of, genesis, jacob, condemned, the, anger, that, had, arisen, in, his, sons, simon, and, levi, cursed, be, their, anger, for, it, was, fierce, and, their, wrath, for, it, was, cruel, restraining, oneself, from, anger, is, seen, as, noble, and, desirable, as, ethics, of, the, fathers, states, ben, zoma, said, who, is, strong, he, who, subdues, his, evil, inclination, as, it, is, stated, he, who, is, slow, to, anger, is, better, than, a, strong, man, and, he, who, masters, his, passions, is, better, than, one, who, conquers, a, city, proverbs, 16, 32, maimonides, rules, that, one, who, becomes, angry, is, as, though, that, person, had, worshipped, idols, rabbi, shneur, zalman, of, liadi, explains, that, the, parallel, between, anger, and, idol, worship, is, that, by, becoming, angry, one, shows, a, disregard, of, divine, providence, whatever, had, caused, the, anger, was, ultimately, ordained, from, above, and, that, through, coming, to, anger, one, thereby, denies, the, hand, of, god, in, one, s, life, in, its, section, dealing, with, ethical, traits, a, person, should, adopt, the, kitzur, shulchan, aruch, states, anger, is, also, a, very, evil, trait, and, it, should, be, avoided, at, all, costs, you, should, train, yourself, not, to, become, angry, even, if, you, have, a, good, reason, to, be, angry, in, modern, writings, rabbi, harold, kushner, finds, no, grounds, for, anger, toward, god, because, our, misfortunes, are, none, of, his, doing, in, contrast, to, kushner, s, reading, of, the, bible, david, blumenthal, finds, an, abusing, god, whose, sometimes, evil, actions, evoke, vigorous, protest, but, without, severing, the, protester, s, relationship, with, god, both, catholic, and, protestant, writers, have, addressed, anger, in, different, perspectives, wrath, is, one, of, the, seven, deadly, sins, in, catholicism, and, yet, the, catechism, of, the, catholic, church, states, canons, 1772, and, 1773, that, anger, is, among, the, passions, and, that, in, the, passions, as, movements, of, the, sensitive, appetite, there, is, neither, good, nor, evil, the, neutral, act, of, anger, becomes, the, sin, of, wrath, when, it, is, directed, against, an, innocent, person, when, it, is, unduly, unbending, or, long, lasting, or, when, it, desires, excessive, punishment, if, anger, reaches, the, point, of, a, deliberate, desire, to, kill, or, seriously, wound, a, neighbor, it, is, gravely, against, charity, it, is, a, mortal, sin, ccc, 2302, hatred, is, the, sin, of, desiring, that, someone, else, may, suffer, misfortune, or, evil, and, is, a, mortal, sin, when, one, desires, grave, harm, ccc, 2302, 03, medieval, christianity, vigorously, denounced, wrath, as, one, of, the, seven, cardinal, or, deadly, sins, but, some, christian, writers, at, times, regarded, the, anger, caused, by, injustice, as, having, some, value, saint, basil, viewed, anger, as, a, reprehensible, temporary, madness, joseph, f, delany, in, the, catholic, encyclopedia, 1914, defines, anger, as, the, desire, of, vengeance, and, states, that, a, reasonable, vengeance, and, passion, is, ethical, and, praiseworthy, vengeance, is, sinful, when, it, exceeds, its, limits, in, which, case, it, becomes, opposed, to, justice, and, charity, for, example, vengeance, upon, one, who, has, not, deserved, it, or, to, a, greater, extent, than, it, has, been, deserved, or, in, conflict, with, the, dispositions, of, law, or, from, an, improper, motive, are, all, sinful, an, unduly, vehement, vengeance, is, considered, a, venial, sin, unless, it, seriously, goes, counter, to, the, love, of, god, or, of, one, s, neighbor, a, more, positive, view, of, anger, is, espoused, by, roman, catholic, pastoral, theologian, henri, j, m, nouwen, father, nouwen, points, to, the, spiritual, benefits, in, anger, toward, god, as, found, in, both, the, old, testament, and, new, testament, of, the, bible, in, the, bible, says, father, nouwen, it, is, clear, that, only, by, expressing, our, anger, and, hatred, directly, to, god, will, we, come, to, know, the, fullness, of, both, his, love, and, our, freedom, georges, bernanos, illustrates, nouwen, s, position, in, his, novel, the, diary, of, a, country, priest, the, countess, gave, birth, to, the, son, she, had, long, wanted, but, the, child, died, she, was, fiercely, angry, when, the, priest, called, the, countess, vented, her, anger, toward, her, daughter, and, husband, then, at, the, priest, who, responded, gently, open, your, heart, to, the, countess, rejoined, i, ve, ceased, to, bother, about, god, when, you, ve, forced, me, to, admit, that, i, hate, him, will, you, be, any, better, off, the, priest, continued, you, no, longer, hate, him, hate, is, indifference, and, contempt, now, at, last, you, re, face, to, face, with, him, shake, your, fist, at, him, spit, in, his, face, scourge, him, the, countess, did, what, the, priest, counseled, by, confessing, her, hate, she, was, enabled, to, say, all, s, well, everyone, experiences, anger, andrew, d, lester, observes, and, furthermore, anger, can, serve, as, a, spiritual, friend, a, spiritual, guide, and, a, spiritual, ally, denying, and, suppressing, anger, is, contrary, to, st, paul, s, admonition, in, his, epistle, to, the, ephesians, 4, 26, when, anger, toward, god, is, denied, and, suppressed, it, interferes, with, an, individual, s, relation, with, god, expressing, one, s, anger, toward, god, can, deepen, the, relationship, c, fitzsimons, allison, holds, that, we, worship, god, by, expressing, our, honest, anger, at, him, biblical, scholar, leonard, pine, concludes, from, his, studies, in, the, book, of, habakkuk, that, far, from, being, a, sin, proper, remonstration, with, god, is, the, activity, of, a, healthy, faith, relationship, with, him, other, biblical, examples, of, anger, toward, god, include, the, following, in, hinduism, anger, is, equated, with, sorrow, as, a, form, of, unrequited, desire, the, objects, of, anger, are, perceived, as, a, hindrance, to, the, gratification, of, the, desires, of, the, angry, person, alternatively, if, one, thinks, one, is, superior, the, result, is, grief, anger, is, considered, to, be, packed, with, more, evil, power, than, desire, in, the, bhagavad, gita, krishna, regards, greed, anger, and, lust, as, signs, of, ignorance, that, lead, to, perpetual, bondage, as, for, the, agitations, of, the, bickering, mind, they, are, divided, into, two, divisions, the, first, is, called, avirodha, pr, ti, or, unrestricted, attachment, and, the, other, is, called, virodha, yukta, krodha, anger, arising, from, frustration, adherence, to, the, philosophy, of, the, m, y, v, d, s, belief, in, the, fruitive, results, of, the, karma, v, d, s, and, belief, in, plans, based, on, materialistic, desires, are, called, avirodha, pr, ti, j, n, s, karm, s, and, materialistic, planmakers, generally, attract, the, attention, of,
