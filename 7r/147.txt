note, varies, by, jurisdiction, note, varies, by, jurisdiction, human, cannibalism, is, the, act, or, practice, of, humans, eating, the, flesh, or, internal, organs, of, other, human, beings, a, person, who, practices, cannibalism, is, called, a, cannibal, the, meaning, of, cannibalism, has, been, extended, into, zoology, to, describe, animals, consuming, parts, of, individuals, of, the, same, species, as, food, anatomically, modern, humans, neanderthals, and, homo, antecessor, are, known, to, have, practised, cannibalism, to, some, extent, in, the, pleistocene, cannibalism, was, occasionally, practised, in, egypt, during, ancient, and, roman, times, as, well, as, later, during, severe, famines, the, island, caribs, of, the, lesser, antilles, whose, name, is, the, origin, of, the, word, cannibal, acquired, a, long, standing, reputation, as, eaters, of, human, flesh, reconfirmed, when, their, legends, were, recorded, in, the, 17th, century, some, controversy, exists, over, the, accuracy, of, these, legends, and, the, prevalence, of, actual, cannibalism, in, the, culture, cannibalism, has, been, well, documented, in, much, of, the, world, including, fiji, once, nicknamed, the, cannibal, isles, the, amazon, basin, the, congo, and, the, m, ori, people, of, new, zealand, cannibalism, was, also, practised, in, new, guinea, and, in, parts, of, the, solomon, islands, and, human, flesh, was, sold, at, markets, in, some, parts, of, melanesia, and, of, the, congo, basin, a, form, of, cannibalism, popular, in, early, modern, europe, was, the, consumption, of, body, parts, or, blood, for, medical, purposes, reaching, its, height, during, the, 17th, century, this, practice, continued, in, some, cases, into, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, cannibalism, has, occasionally, been, practised, as, a, last, resort, by, people, suffering, from, famine, well, known, examples, include, the, ill, fated, donner, party, 1846, 1847, the, holodomor, 1932, 1933, and, the, crash, of, uruguayan, air, force, flight, 571, 1972, after, which, the, survivors, ate, the, bodies, of, the, dead, additionally, there, are, cases, of, people, engaging, in, cannibalism, for, sexual, pleasure, such, as, albert, fish, issei, sagawa, jeffrey, dahmer, and, armin, meiwes, cannibalism, has, been, both, practised, and, fiercely, condemned, in, several, recent, wars, especially, in, liberia, and, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, it, was, still, practised, in, papua, new, guinea, as, of, 2012, for, cultural, reasons, cannibalism, has, been, said, to, test, the, bounds, of, cultural, relativism, because, it, challenges, anthropologists, to, define, what, is, or, is, not, beyond, the, pale, of, acceptable, human, behavior, a, few, scholars, argue, that, no, firm, evidence, exists, that, cannibalism, has, ever, been, a, socially, acceptable, practice, anywhere, in, the, world, but, such, views, have, been, largely, rejected, as, irreconcilable, with, the, actual, evidence, the, word, cannibal, is, derived, from, spanish, can, bal, or, car, bal, originally, used, as, a, name, variant, for, the, kalinago, island, caribs, a, people, from, the, west, indies, said, to, have, eaten, human, flesh, the, older, term, anthropophagy, meaning, eating, humans, is, also, used, for, human, cannibalism, cannibalism, has, been, practised, under, a, variety, of, circumstances, and, for, various, motives, to, adequately, express, this, diversity, shirley, lindenbaum, suggests, that, it, might, be, better, to, talk, about, cannibalisms, in, the, plural, one, major, distinction, is, whether, cannibal, acts, are, accepted, by, the, culture, in, which, they, occur, institutionalized, cannibalism, or, whether, they, are, merely, practised, under, starvation, conditions, to, ensure, one, s, immediate, survival, survival, cannibalism, or, by, isolated, individuals, considered, criminal, and, often, pathological, by, society, at, large, cannibalism, as, psychopathology, or, aberrant, behavior, institutionalized, cannibalism, sometimes, also, called, learned, cannibalism, is, the, consumption, of, human, body, parts, as, an, institutionalized, practice, generally, accepted, in, the, culture, where, it, occurs, by, contrast, survival, cannibalism, means, the, consumption, of, others, under, conditions, of, starvation, such, as, shipwreck, military, siege, and, famine, in, which, persons, normally, averse, to, the, idea, are, driven, by, the, will, to, live, also, known, as, famine, cannibalism, such, forms, of, cannibalism, resorted, to, only, in, situations, of, extreme, necessity, have, occurred, in, many, cultures, where, cannibalism, is, otherwise, clearly, rejected, the, survivors, of, the, shipwrecks, of, the, essex, and, m, duse, in, the, 19th, century, are, said, to, have, engaged, in, cannibalism, as, did, the, members, of, franklin, s, lost, expedition, and, the, donner, party, such, cases, often, involve, only, necro, cannibalism, eating, the, corpse, of, someone, already, dead, as, opposed, to, homicidal, cannibalism, killing, someone, for, food, in, modern, english, law, the, latter, is, always, considered, a, crime, even, in, the, most, trying, circumstances, the, case, of, r, v, dudley, and, stephens, in, which, two, men, were, found, guilty, of, murder, for, killing, and, eating, a, cabin, boy, while, adrift, at, sea, in, a, lifeboat, set, the, precedent, that, necessity, is, no, defence, to, a, charge, of, murder, this, decision, outlawed, and, effectively, ended, the, practice, of, shipwrecked, sailors, drawing, lots, in, order, to, determine, who, would, be, killed, and, eaten, to, prevent, the, others, from, starving, a, time, honoured, practice, formerly, known, as, a, custom, of, the, sea, in, other, cases, cannibalism, is, an, expression, of, a, psychopathology, or, mental, disorder, condemned, by, the, society, in, which, it, occurs, and, considered, to, be, an, indicator, of, severe, personality, disorder, or, psychosis, well, known, cases, include, albert, fish, issei, sagawa, and, armin, meiwes, fantasies, of, cannibalism, whether, acted, out, or, not, are, not, specifically, mentioned, in, manuals, of, mental, disorders, such, as, the, dsm, presumably, because, at, least, serious, cases, that, lead, to, murder, are, very, rare, within, institutionalized, cannibalism, exocannibalism, is, often, distinguished, from, endocannibalism, endocannibalism, refers, to, the, consumption, of, a, person, from, the, same, community, often, it, is, a, part, of, a, funerary, ceremony, similar, to, burial, or, cremation, in, other, cultures, the, consumption, of, the, recently, deceased, in, such, rites, can, be, considered, an, act, of, affection, and, a, major, part, of, the, grieving, process, it, has, also, been, explained, as, a, way, of, guiding, the, souls, of, the, dead, into, the, bodies, of, living, descendants, in, contrast, exocannibalism, is, the, consumption, of, a, person, from, outside, the, community, it, is, frequently, an, act, of, aggression, often, in, the, context, of, warfare, where, the, flesh, of, killed, or, captured, enemies, may, be, eaten, to, celebrate, one, s, victory, over, them, some, scholars, explain, both, types, of, cannibalism, as, due, to, a, belief, that, eating, a, person, s, flesh, or, internal, organs, will, endow, the, cannibal, with, some, of, the, positive, characteristics, of, the, deceased, however, several, authors, investigating, exocannibalism, in, new, zealand, new, guinea, and, the, congo, basin, observe, that, such, beliefs, were, absent, in, these, regions, a, further, type, different, from, both, exo, and, endocannibalism, is, autocannibalism, also, called, autophagy, or, self, cannibalism, the, act, of, eating, parts, of, oneself, it, does, not, ever, seem, to, have, been, an, institutionalized, practice, but, occasionally, occurs, as, pathological, behaviour, or, due, to, other, reasons, such, as, curiosity, also, on, record, are, instances, of, forced, autocannibalism, committed, as, acts, of, aggression, where, individuals, are, forced, to, eat, parts, of, their, own, bodies, as, a, form, of, torture, exocannibalism, is, thus, often, associated, with, the, consumption, of, enemies, as, an, act, of, aggression, a, practice, also, known, as, war, cannibalism, endocannibalism, is, often, associated, with, the, consumption, of, deceased, relatives, in, funerary, rites, driven, by, affection, a, practice, known, as, funerary, or, mortuary, cannibalism, medicinal, cannibalism, also, called, medical, cannibalism, means, the, ingestion, of, human, tissue, as, a, supposed, medicine, or, tonic, in, contrast, to, other, forms, of, cannibalism, which, europeans, generally, frowned, upon, the, medicinal, ingestion, of, various, human, body, parts, was, widely, practiced, throughout, europe, from, the, sixteenth, to, the, eighteenth, centuries, with, early, records, of, the, practice, going, back, to, the, first, century, ce, it, was, also, frequently, practised, in, china, sacrificial, cannibalism, refers, the, consumption, of, the, flesh, of, victims, of, human, sacrifice, for, example, among, the, aztecs, human, and, animal, remains, excavated, in, knossos, crete, have, been, interpreted, as, evidence, of, a, ritual, in, which, children, and, sheep, were, sacrificed, and, eaten, together, during, the, bronze, age, according, to, ancient, roman, reports, the, celts, in, britain, practised, sacrificial, cannibalism, and, archaeological, evidence, backing, these, claims, has, by, now, been, found, infanticidal, cannibalism, or, cannibalistic, infanticide, refers, to, cases, where, newborns, or, infants, are, killed, because, they, are, considered, unwanted, or, unfit, to, live, and, then, consumed, by, the, mother, father, both, parents, or, close, relatives, infanticide, followed, by, cannibalism, was, practised, in, various, regions, but, is, particularly, well, documented, among, aboriginal, australians, among, animals, such, behaviour, is, called, filial, cannibalism, and, it, is, common, in, many, species, especially, among, fish, human, predation, is, the, hunting, of, people, from, unrelated, and, possibly, hostile, groups, in, order, to, eat, them, in, parts, of, the, southern, new, guinea, lowland, rain, forests, hunting, people, was, an, opportunistic, extension, of, seasonal, foraging, or, pillaging, strategies, with, human, bodies, just, as, welcome, as, those, of, animals, as, sources, of, protein, according, to, the, anthropologist, bruce, m, knauft, as, populations, living, near, coasts, and, rivers, were, usually, better, nourished, and, hence, often, physically, larger, and, stronger, than, those, living, inland, they, raided, inland, bush, peoples, with, impunity, and, often, with, little, fear, of, retaliation, cases, of, human, predation, are, also, on, record, for, the, neighbouring, bismarck, archipelago, and, for, australia, in, the, congo, basin, there, lived, groups, such, as, the, zappo, zaps, and, the, bankutu, who, hunted, humans, for, food, even, when, game, was, plentiful, the, term, innocent, cannibalism, has, been, used, for, cases, of, people, eating, human, flesh, without, knowing, what, they, are, eating, it, is, a, subject, of, myths, such, as, the, myth, of, thyestes, who, unknowingly, ate, the, flesh, of, his, own, sons, there, are, also, actual, cases, on, record, for, example, from, the, congo, basin, where, cannibalism, had, been, quite, widespread, and, where, even, in, the, 1950s, travellers, were, sometimes, served, a, meat, dish, learning, only, afterwards, that, the, meat, had, been, of, human, origin, the, term, gastronomic, cannibalism, has, been, suggested, for, cases, where, human, flesh, is, eaten, to, provide, a, supplement, to, the, regular, diet, thus, essentially, for, its, nutritional, value, or, in, an, alternative, definition, for, cases, where, it, is, eaten, without, ceremony, other, than, culinary, in, the, same, manner, as, the, flesh, of, any, other, animal, while, the, term, has, been, criticized, as, being, too, vague, to, clearly, identify, a, specific, type, of, cannibalism, various, records, indicate, that, nutritional, or, culinary, concerns, could, indeed, play, a, role, in, such, acts, even, outside, of, periods, of, starvation, referring, to, the, congo, basin, where, many, of, the, eaten, were, butchered, slaves, rather, than, enemies, killed, in, war, the, anthropologist, emil, torday, notes, that, the, most, common, was, simply, gastronomic, the, natives, loved, the, flesh, that, speaks, and, paid, for, it, the, historian, key, ray, chong, observes, that, throughout, chinese, history, learned, cannibalism, was, often, practiced, for, culinary, appreciation, in, his, popular, book, guns, germs, and, steel, jared, diamond, suggests, that, protein, starvation, is, probably, also, the, ultimate, reason, why, cannibalism, was, widespread, in, traditional, new, guinea, highland, societies, and, both, in, new, zealand, and, fiji, cannibals, explained, their, acts, as, due, to, a, lack, of, animal, meat, in, liberia, a, former, cannibal, argued, that, it, would, have, been, wasteful, to, let, the, flesh, of, killed, enemies, spoil, and, eaters, of, human, flesh, in, new, guinea, and, the, neighbouring, bismarck, archipelago, expressed, the, same, sentiment, in, many, cases, human, flesh, was, also, described, as, particularly, delicious, especially, when, it, came, from, women, children, or, both, such, statements, are, on, record, for, various, regions, and, peoples, including, the, aztecs, today, s, liberia, and, nigeria, the, fang, people, in, west, central, africa, the, congo, basin, china, up, to, the, 14th, century, sumatra, borneo, australia, new, guinea, new, zealand, vanuatu, and, fiji, some, europeans, and, americans, who, ate, human, flesh, accidentally, out, of, curiosity, or, to, comply, with, local, customs, likewise, tended, to, describe, it, as, very, good, there, is, a, debate, among, anthropologists, on, how, important, functionalist, reasons, are, for, the, understanding, of, institutionalized, cannibalism, diamond, is, not, alone, in, suggesting, that, the, consumption, of, human, flesh, was, of, nutritional, benefit, for, some, populations, in, new, guinea, and, the, same, case, has, been, made, for, other, tropical, peoples, exploiting, a, diverse, range, of, animal, foods, including, human, flesh, the, materialist, anthropologist, marvin, harris, argued, that, a, shortage, of, animal, protein, was, also, the, underlying, reason, for, aztec, cannibalism, the, cultural, anthropologist, marshall, sahlins, on, the, other, hand, rejected, such, explanations, as, overly, simplistic, stressing, that, cannibal, customs, must, be, regarded, as, complex, phenomen, with, myriad, attributes, which, can, only, be, understood, if, one, considers, symbolism, ritual, and, cosmology, in, addition, to, their, practical, function, in, pre, modern, medicine, an, explanation, given, by, the, now, discredited, theory, of, humorism, for, cannibalism, was, that, it, was, caused, by, a, black, acrimonious, humor, which, being, lodged, in, the, linings, of, the, ventricles, of, the, heart, produced, a, voracity, for, human, flesh, on, the, other, hand, the, french, philosopher, michel, de, montaigne, understood, war, cannibalism, as, a, way, of, expressing, vengeance, and, hatred, towards, one, s, enemies, and, celebrating, one, s, victory, over, them, thus, giving, an, interpretation, that, is, close, to, modern, explanations, he, also, pointed, out, that, some, acts, of, europeans, in, his, own, time, could, be, considered, as, equally, barbarous, making, his, essay, of, cannibals, c, 1580, a, precursor, to, later, ideas, of, cultural, relativism, archaeologist, james, cole, investigated, the, nutritional, value, of, the, human, body, and, found, it, to, be, similar, to, that, of, animals, of, similar, size, he, notes, that, according, to, ethnographic, and, archaeological, records, nearly, all, edible, parts, of, humans, were, sometimes, eaten, not, only, skeletal, muscle, tissue, flesh, or, meat, in, a, narrow, sense, but, also, lungs, liver, brain, heart, nervous, tissue, bone, marrow, genitalia, and, skin, as, well, as, kidneys, for, a, typical, adult, man, the, combined, nutritional, value, of, all, these, edible, parts, is, about, 126, 000, kilocalories, kcal, the, nutritional, value, of, women, and, younger, individuals, is, lower, because, of, their, lower, body, weight, for, example, around, 86, of, a, male, adult, for, an, adult, woman, and, 30, for, a, boy, aged, around, 5, or, 6, as, the, daily, energy, need, of, an, adult, man, is, about, 2, 400, kilocalories, a, dead, male, body, could, thus, have, fed, a, group, of, 25, men, for, a, bit, more, than, two, days, provided, they, ate, nothing, but, the, human, flesh, alone, longer, if, it, was, part, of, a, mixed, diet, the, nutritional, value, of, the, human, body, is, thus, not, insubstantial, though, cole, notes, that, for, prehistoric, hunters, large, megafauna, such, as, mammoths, rhinoceros, and, bisons, would, have, been, an, even, better, deal, as, long, as, they, were, available, and, could, be, caught, because, of, their, much, higher, body, weight, cases, of, people, eating, human, livers, and, hearts, especially, of, enemies, have, been, reported, from, across, the, world, after, the, battle, of, uhud, 625, hind, bint, utba, ate, or, at, least, attempted, to, the, liver, of, hamza, ibn, abd, al, muttalib, an, uncle, of, muhammad, at, that, time, the, liver, was, considered, the, seat, of, life, french, catholics, ate, livers, and, hearts, of, huguenots, at, the, st, bartholomew, s, day, massacre, in, 1572, in, some, cases, also, offering, them, for, sale, in, china, medical, cannibalism, was, practised, over, centuries, people, voluntarily, cut, their, own, body, parts, including, parts, of, their, livers, and, boiled, them, to, cure, ailing, relatives, children, were, sometimes, killed, because, eating, their, boiled, hearts, was, considered, a, good, way, of, extending, one, s, life, emperor, wuzong, of, tang, supposedly, ordered, provincial, officials, to, send, him, the, hearts, and, livers, of, fifteen, year, old, boys, and, girls, when, he, had, become, seriously, ill, hoping, in, vain, this, medicine, would, cure, him, later, private, individuals, sometimes, followed, his, example, paying, soldiers, who, kidnapped, preteen, children, for, their, kitchen, when, human, flesh, and, organs, were, sold, openly, at, the, marketplace, during, the, taiping, rebellion, in, 1850, 1864, human, hearts, became, a, popular, dish, according, to, some, who, afterwards, freely, admitted, having, consumed, them, according, to, a, missionary, s, report, from, the, brutal, suppression, of, the, dungan, revolt, of, 1895, 1896, in, northwestern, china, thousands, of, men, women, and, children, were, ruthlessly, massacred, by, the, imperial, soldiers, and, many, a, meal, of, human, hearts, and, livers, was, partaken, of, by, soldiers, supposedly, out, of, a, belief, that, this, would, give, them, the, courage, their, enemies, had, displayed, in, world, war, ii, japanese, soldiers, ate, the, livers, of, killed, americans, in, the, chichijima, incident, many, japanese, soldiers, who, died, during, the, occupation, of, jolo, island, in, the, philippines, had, their, livers, eaten, by, local, moro, fighters, according, to, japanese, soldier, fujioka, akiyoshi, during, the, cultural, revolution, 1966, 1976, hundreds, of, incidents, of, cannibalism, occurred, mostly, motivated, by, hatred, against, supposed, class, enemies, but, sometimes, also, by, health, concerns, in, a, case, recorded, by, the, local, authorities, a, school, teacher, in, mengshan, county, heard, that, consuming, a, beauty, s, heart, could, cure, disease, he, then, chose, a, 13, or, 14, year, old, student, of, his, and, publicly, denounced, her, as, a, member, of, the, enemy, faction, which, was, enough, to, get, her, killed, by, an, angry, mob, after, the, others, had, left, he, cut, open, the, girl, s, chest, dug, out, her, heart, and, took, it, home, to, enjoy, in, a, further, case, that, took, place, in, wuxuan, county, likewise, in, the, guangxi, region, three, brothers, were, beaten, to, death, as, supposed, enemies, afterwards, their, livers, were, cut, out, baked, and, consumed, as, medicine, according, to, the, chinese, author, zheng, yi, who, researched, these, events, the, consumption, of, human, liver, was, mentioned, at, least, fifty, or, sixty, times, in, just, a, small, number, of, archival, documents, he, talked, with, a, man, who, had, eaten, human, liver, and, told, him, that, barbecued, liver, is, delicious, during, a, massacre, of, the, madurese, minority, in, the, indonesian, part, of, borneo, in, 1999, reporter, richard, lloyd, parry, met, a, young, cannibal, who, had, just, participated, in, a, human, barbecue, and, told, him, without, hesitation, it, tastes, just, like, chicken, especially, the, liver, just, the, same, as, chicken, in, 2013, during, the, syrian, civil, war, syrian, rebel, abu, sakkar, was, filmed, eating, parts, of, the, lung, or, liver, of, a, government, soldier, while, declaring, that, we, will, eat, your, hearts, and, your, livers, you, soldiers, of, bashar, the, dog, various, accounts, from, around, the, world, mention, women, s, breasts, as, a, favourite, body, part, also, frequently, mentioned, are, the, palms, of, the, hands, and, sometimes, the, soles, of, the, foots, regardless, of, the, victim, s, gender, jerome, in, his, treatise, against, jovinianus, claimed, that, the, british, attacotti, were, cannibals, who, regarded, the, buttocks, of, men, and, the, breasts, of, women, as, delicacies, during, the, mongol, invasion, of, europe, in, the, 13th, century, and, their, subsequent, rule, over, china, during, the, yuan, dynasty, 1271, 1368, some, mongol, fighters, practised, cannibalism, and, both, european, and, chinese, observers, record, a, preference, for, women, s, breasts, which, were, considered, delicacies, and, if, there, were, many, corpses, sometimes, the, only, part, of, a, female, body, that, was, eaten, of, men, only, the, thighs, were, said, to, be, eaten, in, such, circumstances, after, meeting, a, group, of, cannibals, in, west, africa, in, the, 14th, century, the, moroccan, explorer, ibn, battuta, recorded, that, according, to, their, preferences, the, tastiest, part, of, women, s, flesh, is, the, palms, and, the, breast, centuries, later, the, anthropologist, percy, amaury, talbot, wrote, that, in, southern, nigeria, the, parts, in, greatest, favour, are, the, palms, of, the, hands, the, fingers, and, toes, and, of, a, woman, the, breast, regarding, the, north, of, the, country, his, colleague, charles, kingsley, meek, added, among, all, the, cannibal, tribes, the, palms, of, the, hands, and, the, soles, of, the, feet, were, considered, the, tit, bits, of, the, body, among, the, apambia, a, cannibalistic, clan, of, the, azande, people, in, central, africa, the, palms, of, the, hands, and, the, soles, of, the, foots, were, considered, the, best, parts, of, the, human, body, while, their, favourite, dish, was, prepared, with, fat, from, a, woman, s, breast, according, to, the, missionary, and, ethnographer, f, gero, similar, preferences, are, on, record, throughout, melanesia, according, to, the, anthropologists, bernard, deacon, and, camilla, wedgwood, women, were, specially, fattened, for, eating, in, vanuatu, the, breasts, being, the, great, delicacy, a, missionary, confirmed, that, a, body, of, a, female, usually, formed, the, principal, part, of, the, repast, at, feasts, for, chiefs, and, warriors, the, ethnologist, felix, speiser, writes, apart, from, the, breasts, of, women, and, the, genitals, of, men, palms, of, hands, and, soles, of, feet, were, the, most, coveted, morsels, he, knew, a, chief, on, ambae, one, of, the, islands, of, vanuatu, who, according, to, fairly, reliably, sources, dined, on, a, young, girl, s, breasts, every, few, days, when, visiting, the, solomon, islands, in, the, 1980s, anthropologist, michael, krieger, met, a, former, cannibal, who, told, him, that, women, s, breasts, had, been, considered, the, best, part, of, the, human, body, because, they, were, so, fatty, with, fat, being, a, rare, and, sought, delicacy, they, were, also, considered, among, the, best, parts, in, new, guinea, and, the, bismarck, archipelago, based, on, theoretical, considerations, the, structuralist, anthropologist, claude, l, vi, strauss, suggested, that, human, flesh, was, most, typically, boiled, with, roasting, also, used, to, prepare, the, bodies, of, enemies, and, other, outsiders, in, exocannibalism, but, rarely, in, funerary, endocannibalism, when, eating, deceased, relatives, but, an, analysis, of, 60, sufficiently, detailed, and, credible, descriptions, of, institutionalized, cannibalism, by, anthropologist, paul, shankman, failed, to, confirm, this, hypothesis, shankman, found, that, roasting, and, boiling, together, accounted, for, only, about, half, of, the, cases, with, roasting, being, slightly, more, common, in, contrast, to, l, vi, strauss, s, predictions, boiling, was, more, often, used, in, exocannibalism, while, roasting, was, about, equally, common, for, both, shankman, observed, that, various, other, ways, of, preparing, people, were, repeatedly, employed, as, well, in, one, third, of, all, cases, two, or, more, modes, were, used, together, e, g, some, bodies, or, body, parts, were, boiled, or, baked, while, others, were, roasted, human, flesh, was, baked, in, steam, on, preheated, rocks, or, in, earth, ovens, a, technique, widely, used, in, the, pacific, smoked, which, allowed, to, preserve, it, for, later, consumption, or, eaten, raw, while, these, modes, were, used, in, both, exo, and, endocannibalism, another, method, that, was, only, used, in, the, latter, and, only, in, the, americas, was, to, burn, the, bones, or, bodies, of, deceased, relatives, and, then, to, consume, the, bone, ash, after, analysing, numerous, accounts, from, china, key, ray, chong, similarly, concludes, that, a, variety, of, methods, for, cooking, human, flesh, were, used, in, this, country, most, popular, were, broiling, roasting, boiling, and, steaming, followed, by, pickling, in, salt, wine, sauce, and, the, like, human, flesh, was, also, often, cooked, into, soup, or, stewed, in, cauldrons, eating, human, flesh, raw, was, the, least, popular, method, but, a, few, cases, are, on, record, too, chong, notes, that, human, flesh, was, typically, cooked, in, the, same, way, as, ordinary, foodstuffs, for, daily, consumption, no, principal, distinction, from, the, treatment, of, animal, meat, is, detectable, and, nearly, any, mode, of, preparation, used, for, animals, could, also, be, used, for, people, though, human, corpses, like, those, of, animals, were, usually, cut, into, pieces, for, further, processing, reports, of, people, being, roasted, or, baked, whole, are, on, record, throughout, the, world, at, the, archaeological, site, of, herxheim, germany, more, than, a, thousand, people, were, killed, and, eaten, about, 7000, years, ago, and, the, evidence, indicates, that, many, of, them, were, spit, roasted, whole, over, open, fires, during, severe, famines, in, china, and, egypt, during, the, 12th, and, early, 13th, centuries, there, was, a, black, market, trade, in, corpses, of, little, children, that, were, roasted, or, boiled, whole, in, china, human, flesh, sellers, advertised, such, corpses, as, good, for, being, boiled, or, steamed, whole, including, their, bones, and, praised, their, particular, tenderness, in, cairo, egypt, the, arab, physician, abd, al, latif, al, baghdadi, repeatedly, saw, little, children, roasted, or, boiled, offered, for, sale, in, baskets, on, street, corners, during, a, heavy, famine, that, started, in, 1200, ce, older, children, and, possibly, adults, were, sometimes, prepared, in, the, same, way, once, he, saw, a, child, nearing, the, age, of, puberty, who, had, been, found, roasted, two, young, people, confessed, to, having, killed, and, cooked, the, child, another, time, remains, were, found, of, a, person, who, had, apparently, been, roasted, and, served, whole, the, legs, tied, like, those, of, a, sheep, trussed, for, cooking, only, the, skeleton, was, found, still, undivided, and, in, the, trussed, position, but, with, all, the, flesh, stripped, off, for, food, in, some, cases, children, were, roasted, and, offered, for, sale, by, their, own, parents, other, victims, were, street, children, who, had, become, very, numerous, and, were, often, kidnapped, and, cooked, by, people, looking, for, food, or, extra, income, the, victims, were, so, numerous, that, sometimes, two, or, three, children, even, more, would, be, found, in, a, single, cooking, pot, al, latif, notes, that, while, initially, people, were, shocked, by, such, acts, they, eventually, grew, accustomed, and, some, conceived, such, a, taste, for, these, detestable, meats, that, they, made, them, their, ordinary, provender, the, horror, people, had, felt, at, first, vanished, entirely, after, the, end, of, the, mongol, led, yuan, dynasty, 1271, 1368, a, chinese, writer, criticized, in, his, recollections, of, the, period, that, some, mongol, soldiers, ate, human, flesh, because, of, its, taste, rather, than, as, had, also, occurred, in, other, times, merely, in, cases, of, necessity, he, added, that, they, enjoyed, torturing, their, victims, often, children, or, women, whose, flesh, was, preferred, over, that, of, men, by, roasting, them, alive, in, large, jars, whose, outside, touched, the, fire, on, an, iron, grate, other, victims, were, placed, inside, a, double, bag, which, was, put, into, a, large, pot, and, so, boiled, alive, while, not, mentioning, live, roasting, or, boiling, european, authors, also, complained, about, cannibalism, and, cruelty, during, the, mongol, invasion, of, europe, and, a, drawing, in, the, chronica, majora, compiled, by, matthew, paris, shows, mongol, fighters, spit, roasting, a, human, victim, pedro, de, margarit, who, accompanied, christopher, columbus, during, his, second, voyage, afterwards, stated, that, he, saw, there, with, his, own, eyes, several, indians, skewered, on, spits, being, roasted, over, burning, coals, as, a, treat, for, the, gluttonous, jean, de, l, ry, who, lived, for, several, months, among, the, tupinamb, in, brazil, writes, that, several, of, his, companions, reported, that, they, had, seen, not, only, a, number, of, men, and, women, cut, in, pieces, and, grilled, on, the, boucans, but, also, little, unweaned, children, roasted, whole, after, a, successful, attack, on, an, enemy, village, according, to, german, ethnologist, leo, frobenius, children, captured, by, songye, slave, raiders, in, the, central, african, kasa, region, that, were, too, young, to, be, sold, with, a, profit, were, instead, skewered, on, long, spears, like, rats, and, roasted, over, a, quickly, kindled, large, fire, for, consumption, by, the, raiders, in, the, solomon, islands, in, the, 1870s, a, british, captain, saw, a, dead, body, dressed, and, cooked, whole, offered, for, sale, in, a, canoe, a, settler, treated, the, scene, as, an, every, day, occurrence, and, told, him, that, he, had, seen, as, many, as, twenty, bodies, lying, on, the, beach, dressed, and, cooked, decades, later, a, missionary, reported, that, whole, bodies, were, still, offered, up, and, down, the, coast, in, canoes, for, sale, after, battles, since, human, flesh, was, eaten, for, pleasure, in, fiji, whole, human, bodies, cooked, in, earth, ovens, were, served, in, carefully, pre, arranged, postures, according, to, anthropologist, lorimer, fison, and, several, other, sources, the, limbs, having, been, arranged, in, the, posture, which, it, is, intended, they, shall, assume, banana, leaves, are, wrapped, round, them, to, prevent, the, flesh, falling, off, in, the, possible, event, of, over, baking, a, hole, of, sufficient, size, is, then, dug, in, the, earth, and, filled, with, dry, wood, which, is, set, on, fire, when, it, is, well, kindled, a, number, of, stones, about, the, size, of, a, man, s, fist, are, thrown, into, it, and, when, the, firewood, is, burnt, down, to, a, mass, of, glowing, embers, some, of, the, heated, stones, are, lifted, nimbly, by, tongs, made, of, bent, withes, and, thrust, within, the, dead, man, s, body, presently, the, mound, swells, and, rises, little, cracks, appear, whence, issue, jets, of, steam, diffusing, a, savoury, odour, and, in, due, time, of, which, the, fijians, are, excellent, judges, the, culinary, process, is, complete, the, earth, is, then, cautiously, removed, the, body, lifted, out, its, wrappings, taken, off, its, face, painted, a, wig, or, a, turban, placed, upon, its, head, and, there, we, have, a, trussed, frog, in, all, its, unspeakable, hideousness, staring, at, us, with, wide, open, prominent, lack, lustre, eyes, there, is, no, burning, or, roasting, the, body, is, cooked, in, its, own, steam, and, the, features, are, so, little, disturbed, by, the, process, that, the, dead, man, can, almost, always, be, recognised, by, those, who, knew, him, when, he, was, alive, within, this, archipelago, it, was, especially, the, gau, islanders, who, were, famous, for, cooking, bodies, whole, in, new, caledonia, a, missionary, named, ta, unga, from, the, cook, islands, repeatedly, saw, how, whole, human, bodies, were, cooked, in, earth, ovens, they, tie, the, hands, together, and, bundle, them, up, together, with, the, intestines, the, legs, are, bent, up, and, bound, with, hibiscus, bark, when, it, is, completed, they, lay, the, body, out, flat, on, its, back, in, the, earth, oven, then, when, it, is, baked, ready, they, cut, it, up, and, eat, it, ta, unga, commented, one, curious, thing, is, that, when, a, man, is, alive, he, has, a, human, appearance, but, after, he, is, baked, he, looks, more, like, a, dog, as, the, lips, are, shriveled, back, and, his, teeth, are, bared, among, the, m, ori, in, new, zealand, children, captured, in, war, campaigns, were, sometimes, spit, roasted, whole, after, slitting, open, their, bellies, to, remove, the, intestines, as, various, sources, report, enslaved, children, including, teenagers, could, meet, the, same, fate, and, whole, babies, were, sometimes, served, at, the, tables, of, chiefs, in, the, marquesas, islands, captives, preferably, women, killed, for, consumption, were, spitted, on, long, poles, that, entered, between, their, legs, and, emerged, from, their, mouths, and, then, roasted, whole, similar, customs, had, a, long, history, in, nuku, hiva, the, largest, of, these, islands, archaeologists, found, the, partially, consumed, remains, of, a, young, child, that, had, been, roasted, whole, in, an, oven, during, the, 14th, century, or, earlier, a, well, known, case, of, mortuary, cannibalism, is, that, of, the, fore, tribe, in, new, guinea, which, resulted, in, the, spread, of, the, prion, disease, kuru, although, the, fore, s, mortuary, cannibalism, was, well, documented, the, practice, had, ceased, before, the, cause, of, the, disease, was, recognized, however, some, scholars, argue, that, although, post, mortem, dismemberment, was, the, practice, during, funeral, rites, cannibalism, was, not, marvin, harris, theorizes, that, it, happened, during, a, famine, period, coincident, with, the, arrival, of, europeans, and, was, rationalized, as, a, religious, rite, in, 2003, a, publication, in, science, received, a, large, amount, of, press, attention, when, it, suggested, that, early, humans, may, have, practised, extensive, cannibalism, according, to, this, research, genetic, markers, commonly, found, in, modern, humans, worldwide, suggest, that, today, many, people, carry, a, gene, that, evolved, as, protection, against, the, brain, diseases, that, can, be, spread, by, consuming, human, brain, tissue, a, 2006, reanalysis, of, the, data, questioned, this, hypothesis, because, it, claimed, to, have, found, a, data, collection, bias, which, led, to, an, erroneous, conclusion, this, claimed, bias, came, from, incidents, of, cannibalism, used, in, the, analysis, not, being, due, to, local, cultures, but, having, been, carried, out, by, explorers, stranded, seafarers, or, escaped, convicts, the, original, authors, published, a, subsequent, paper, in, 2008, defending, their, conclusions, cannibalism, features, in, the, folklore, and, legends, of, many, cultures, and, is, most, often, attributed, to, evil, characters, or, as, extreme, retribution, for, some, wrongdoing, examples, include, the, witch, in, hansel, and, gretel, lamia, of, greek, mythology, the, witch, baba, yaga, of, slavic, folklore, and, the, yama, uba, in, japanese, folklore, a, number, of, stories, in, greek, mythology, involve, cannibalism, in, particular, the, eating, of, close, family, members, e, g, the, stories, of, thyestes, tereus, and, especially, cronus, who, became, saturn, in, the, roman, pantheon, the, story, of, tantalus, is, another, example, though, here, a, family, member, is, prepared, for, consumption, by, others, the, wendigo, is, a, creature, appearing, in, the, legends, of, the, algonquian, people, it, is, thought, of, variously, as, a, malevolent, cannibalistic, spirit, that, could, possess, humans, or, a, monster, that, humans, could, physically, transform, into, those, who, indulged, in, cannibalism, were, at, particular, risk, and, the, legend, appears, to, have, reinforced, this, practice, as, taboo, the, zuni, people, tell, the, story, of, the, tahsaia, a, giant, who, cannibalizes, his, fellow, demons, and, seeks, out, human, flesh, the, wechuge, is, a, demonic, cannibalistic, creature, that, seeks, out, human, flesh, appearing, in, the, mythology, of, the, athabaskan, people, it, is, said, to, be, half, monster, and, half, human, like, however, it, has, many, shapes, and, forms, william, arens, author, of, the, man, eating, myth, anthropology, and, anthropophagy, questions, the, credibility, of, reports, of, cannibalism, and, argues, that, the, description, by, one, group, of, people, of, another, people, as, cannibals, is, a, consistent, and, demonstrable, ideological, and, rhetorical, device, to, establish, perceived, cultural, superiority, arens, bases, his, thesis, on, a, detailed, analysis, of, various, classic, cases, of, cannibalism, reported, by, explorers, missionaries, and, anthropologists, he, claims, that, all, of, them, were, steeped, in, racism, unsubstantiated, or, based, on, second, hand, or, hearsay, evidence, though, widely, discussed, arens, s, book, generally, failed, to, convince, the, academic, community, claude, l, vi, strauss, observes, that, in, spite, of, his, brilliant, but, superficial, book, o, serious, ethnologist, disputes, the, reality, of, cannibalism, shirley, lindenbaum, notes, that, while, after, arens, provocative, suggestion, many, anthropologists, reevaluated, their, data, the, outcome, was, an, improved, and, more, nuanced, understanding, of, where, why, and, under, which, circumstances, cannibalism, took, place, rather, than, a, confirmation, of, his, claims, anthropologists, working, in, the, americas, africa, and, melanesia, now, acknowledge, that, institutionalized, cannibalism, occurred, in, some, places, at, some, times, archaeologists, and, evolutionary, biologists, are, taking, cannibalism, seriously, lindenbaum, and, others, point, out, that, arens, displays, a, strong, ethnocentrism, his, refusal, to, admit, that, institutionalized, cannibalism, ever, existed, seems, to, be, motivated, by, the, implied, idea, that, cannibalism, is, the, worst, thing, of, all, worse, than, any, other, behaviour, people, engaged, in, and, therefore, uniquely, suited, to, vilifying, others, kajsa, ekholm, friedman, calls, this, a, remarkable, opinion, in, a, culture, that, has, been, capable, of, the, most, extreme, cruelty, and, destructive, behavior, both, at, home, and, in, other, parts, of, the, world, she, observes, that, contrary, to, european, values, and, expectations, in, many, parts, of, the, congo, region, there, was, no, negative, evaluation, of, cannibalism, on, the, contrary, people, expressed, their, strong, appreciation, of, this, very, special, meat, and, could, not, understand, the, hysterical, reactions, from, the, white, man, s, side, and, why, indeed, she, goes, on, to, ask, should, they, have, had, the, same, negative, reactions, to, cannibalism, as, arens, and, his, contemporaries, implicitly, he, assumes, that, everybody, throughout, human, history, must, have, shared, the, strong, taboo, placed, by, his, own, culture, on, cannibalism, but, he, never, attempts, to, explain, why, this, should, be, so, and, neither, logic, nor, historical, evidence, justifies, this, viewpoint, as, christian, siefkes, commented, some, have, argued, that, it, is, the, taboo, against, cannibalism, rather, than, its, practice, that, needs, to, be, explained, hubert, murray, the, lieutenant, governor, of, papua, in, the, early, 20th, century, admitted, that, i, have, never, been, able, to, give, a, convincing, answer, to, a, native, who, says, to, me, why, should, i, not, eat, human, flesh, after, observing, that, the, orokaiva, people, in, new, guinea, explained, their, cannibal, customs, as, due, to, a, simple, desire, for, good, food, the, australian, anthropologist, f, e, williams, commented, anthropologically, speaking, the, fact, that, we, ourselves, should, persist, in, a, superstitious, or, at, least, sentimental, prejudice, against, human, flesh, is, more, puzzling, than, the, fact, that, the, orokaiva, a, born, hunter, should, see, fit, to, enjoy, perfectly, good, meat, when, he, gets, it, accusations, of, cannibalism, could, be, used, to, characterize, indigenous, peoples, as, uncivilized, primitive, or, even, inhuman, while, this, means, that, the, reliability, of, reports, of, cannibal, practices, must, be, carefully, evaluated, especially, if, their, wording, suggests, such, a, context, many, actual, accounts, do, not, fit, this, pattern, the, earliest, firsthand, account, of, cannibal, customs, in, the, caribbean, comes, from, diego, lvarez, chanca, who, accompanied, christopher, columbus, on, his, second, voyage, his, description, of, the, customs, of, the, caribs, of, guadeloupe, includes, their, cannibalism, men, killed, or, captured, in, war, were, eaten, while, captured, boys, were, castrated, servants, until, they, gr, w, up, when, they, slaughtered, for, consumption, but, he, nevertheless, notes, that, these, people, are, more, civilized, than, the, other, islanders, who, did, not, practice, cannibalism, nor, was, he, an, exception, among, the, earliest, reports, of, cannibalism, in, the, caribbean, and, the, americas, there, are, some, like, those, of, amerigo, vespucci, that, seem, to, mostly, consist, of, hearsay, and, gross, exaggerations, but, others, by, chanca, columbus, himself, and, other, early, travellers, show, genuine, interest, and, respect, for, the, natives, and, include, numerous, cases, of, sincere, praise, reports, of, cannibalism, from, other, continents, follow, similar, patterns, condescending, remarks, can, be, found, but, many, europeans, who, described, cannibal, customs, in, central, africa, wrote, about, those, who, practised, them, in, quite, positive, terms, calling, them, splendid, and, the, finest, people, and, not, rarely, like, chanca, actually, considering, them, as, far, in, advance, of, and, intellectually, and, morally, superior, to, the, non, cannibals, around, them, writing, from, melanesia, the, missionary, george, brown, explicitly, rejects, the, european, prejudice, of, picturing, cannibals, as, particularly, ferocious, and, repulsive, noting, instead, that, many, cannibals, he, met, were, no, more, ferocious, than, others, and, indeed, very, nice, people, reports, or, assertions, of, cannibal, practices, could, nevertheless, be, used, to, promote, the, use, of, military, force, as, a, means, of, civilizing, and, pacifying, the, savages, during, the, spanish, conquest, of, the, aztec, empire, and, its, earlier, conquests, in, the, caribbean, there, were, widespread, reports, of, cannibalism, and, cannibals, became, exempted, from, queen, isabella, s, prohibition, on, enslaving, the, indigenous, another, example, of, the, sensationalism, of, cannibalism, and, its, connection, to, imperialism, occurred, during, japan, s, 1874, expedition, to, taiwan, as, robert, eskildsen, describes, japan, s, popular, media, exaggerated, the, aborigines, violent, nature, in, some, cases, by, wrongly, accusing, them, of, cannibalism, this, horrid, practice, the, myth, and, reality, of, traditional, maori, cannibalism, 2008, by, new, zealand, historian, paul, moon, received, a, hostile, reception, by, some, m, ori, who, felt, the, book, tarnished, their, whole, people, however, the, factual, accuracy, of, the, book, was, not, seriously, disputed, and, even, critics, such, as, margaret, mutu, grant, that, cannibalism, was, definitely, practised, and, that, it, was, part, of, our, culture, there, is, archaeological, evidence, that, cannibalism, has, been, practised, for, at, least, hundreds, of, thousands, of, years, by, early, homo, sapiens, and, archaic, hominins, among, modern, humans, cannibalism, has, been, practised, by, various, groups, an, incomplete, list, of, cases, where, it, is, documented, to, have, occurred, in, institutionalized, form, includes, prehistoric, and, early, modern, europe, south, america, mesoamerica, iroquoian, peoples, in, north, america, parts, of, western, and, central, africa, china, and, sumatra, among, pre, contact, aboriginal, australians, among, m, ori, in, new, zealand, on, some, other, polynesian, islands, as, well, as, in, new, guinea, the, solomon, islands, and, fiji, evidence, of, cannibalism, has, also, been, found, in, ruins, associated, with, the, ancestral, puebloans, at, cowboy, wash, in, the, southwestern, united, states, after, world, war, i, institutionalized, cannibalism, has, become, very, rare, but, cases, were, still, reported, during, times, of, famine, occasional, cannibal, acts, committed, by, individual, criminals, also, are, documented, throughout, the, 20th, and, 21st, centuries, cannibalism, in, the, americas, has, been, practiced, in, many, places, throughout, much, of, the, history, of, north, america, and, south, america, the, modern, term, cannibal, is, derived, from, the, name, of, the, island, caribs, kalinago, who, were, encountered, by, christopher, columbus, in, the, bahamas, numerous, cultures, in, the, americas, were, reported, by, european, explorers, and, colonizers, to, have, engaged, in, cannibalism, however, these, claims, may, be, unreliable, since, the, spanish, empire, used, them, to, justify, conquest, at, least, some, cultures, have, been, physically, and, archeologically, proven, beyond, any, doubt, whatsoever, to, have, undertaken, institutionalized, cannibalism, this, includes, human, bones, uncovered, in, a, cave, hamlet, confirming, accounts, of, the, xiximes, undertaking, ritualized, raids, as, part, of, their, agricultural, cycle, after, every, harvest, also, proven, are, the, aztec, ritual, ceremonies, during, the, spanish, conquest, at, tecoaque, the, anasazi, in, the, 12th, century, have, also, been, demonstrated, to, have, undertaken, cannibalism, possibly, due, to, drought, as, shown, by, proteins, from, human, flesh, found, in, recovered, feces, there, is, near, universal, agreement, that, some, mesoamericans, practiced, human, sacrifice, and, cannibalism, but, there, is, no, scholarly, consensus, as, to, its, extent, anthropologist, marvin, harris, author, of, cannibals, and, kings, has, suggested, that, the, flesh, of, the, victims, was, a, part, of, an, aristocratic, diet, as, a, reward, since, the, aztec, diet, was, lacking, in, proteins, according, to, harris, the, aztec, economy, would, not, support, feeding, enslaved, people, the, captured, in, war, and, the, columns, of, prisoners, were, marching, meat, conversely, bernard, r, ortiz, de, montellano, has, proposed, that, aztec, cannibalism, coincided, with, harvest, times, and, should, be, considered, more, of, a, thanksgiving, montellano, rejects, the, theories, of, harner, and, harris, saying, that, with, evidence, of, so, many, tributes, and, intensive, chinampa, agriculture, the, aztecs, did, not, need, any, other, food, sources, william, arens, 1979, book, the, man, eating, myth, claimed, that, there, is, no, firm, substantiable, evidence, for, the, socially, accepted, practice, of, cannibalism, anywhere, in, the, world, at, any, time, in, history, but, his, views, have, been, largely, rejected, as, irreconcilable, with, the, actual, evidence, acts, of, cannibalism, in, africa, have, been, reported, from, various, parts, of, the, continent, ranging, from, prehistoric, times, until, the, 21st, century, the, oldest, firm, evidence, of, archaic, humans, consuming, each, other, dates, to, 1, 45, million, years, ago, in, kenya, archaeological, evidence, for, human, cannibalism, exists, later, among, anatomically, modern, humans, but, its, frequency, remains, unknown, later, in, east, africa, the, ugandan, dictator, idi, amin, was, reputed, to, practise, cannibalism, and, acts, of, voluntary, and, forced, cannibalism, have, been, reported, from, the, south, sudanese, civil, war, while, the, oldest, known, written, mention, of, cannibalism, is, from, the, tomb, of, the, egyptian, king, unas, later, evidence, from, egypt, shows, it, to, only, re, appear, during, occasional, episodes, of, severe, famine, the, oldest, records, of, cannibalism, in, west, africa, are, from, muslim, authors, who, visited, the, region, in, the, 14th, century, later, accounts, often, ascribe, it, to, secret, societies, such, as, the, leopard, society, cannibal, practices, were, also, documented, among, various, nigerian, peoples, such, as, the, igbo, the, victims, were, usually, killed, or, captured, enemies, kidnapped, strangers, and, purchased, enslaved, persons, cannibalism, was, practised, to, express, hatred, and, to, humiliate, one, s, enemies, as, well, as, to, avoid, waste, and, because, meat, in, general, was, rare, human, flesh, was, also, considered, tastier, than, that, of, animals, while, its, consumption, during, peacetime, seems, to, have, ceased, cannibal, acts, are, on, record, for, civil, wars, in, liberia, and, sierra, leone, around, the, turn, from, the, 20th, to, the, 21st, century, in, the, late, 19th, century, cannibalism, seems, to, have, been, especially, prevalent, in, parts, of, the, congo, basin, while, some, groups, rejected, the, custom, others, indulged, in, human, flesh, often, considering, it, superior, to, other, meats, killed, or, captured, enemies, could, be, consumed, and, individuals, from, different, ethnic, groups, were, sometimes, hunted, down, for, the, same, purpose, enslaved, people, were, also, sacrificed, for, the, table, especially, young, children, who, were, otherwise, in, little, demand, but, praised, as, particularly, delicious, in, some, areas, human, flesh, and, slaves, intended, for, eating, were, sold, at, marketplaces, while, cannibalism, became, rarer, under, the, colonial, congo, free, state, and, its, belgium, run, successor, colonial, authorities, seem, to, have, done, little, to, suppress, the, practice, human, flesh,
