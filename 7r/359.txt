https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dravidian_languages
the, dravidian, languages, sometimes, called, dravidic, are, a, family, of, languages, spoken, by, 250, million, people, mainly, in, south, india, north, east, sri, lanka, and, south, west, pakistan, with, pockets, elsewhere, in, south, asia, dravidian, is, first, attested, in, the, 2nd, century, bce, as, inscriptions, in, tamil, brahmi, script, on, cave, walls, in, the, madurai, and, tirunelveli, districts, of, tamil, nadu, the, dravidian, languages, with, the, most, speakers, are, in, descending, order, of, number, of, speakers, telugu, tamil, kannada, and, malayalam, all, of, which, have, long, literary, traditions, smaller, literary, languages, are, tulu, and, kodava, together, with, several, smaller, languages, such, as, gondi, these, languages, cover, the, southern, part, of, india, and, the, northeast, of, sri, lanka, and, account, for, the, overwhelming, majority, of, speakers, of, dravidian, languages, malto, and, kurukh, are, spoken, in, isolated, pockets, in, eastern, india, kurukh, is, also, spoken, in, parts, of, nepal, bhutan, and, bangladesh, brahui, is, mostly, spoken, in, the, balochistan, region, of, pakistan, iranian, balochistan, afghanistan, and, around, the, marw, oasis, in, turkmenistan, during, the, colonial, period, in, india, dravidian, speakers, were, exploited, by, the, colonial, empires, and, sent, as, indentured, servants, to, southeast, asia, mauritius, south, africa, fiji, and, the, caribbean, to, work, on, plantations, and, to, east, africa, to, work, on, british, railroads, there, are, more, recent, dravidian, speaking, diaspora, communities, in, the, middle, east, europe, north, america, and, oceania, the, reconstructed, proto, language, of, the, family, is, known, as, proto, dravidian, dravidian, place, names, along, the, arabian, sea, coast, and, clear, signs, of, dravidian, phonological, and, grammatical, influence, e, g, retroflex, consonants, and, clusivity, in, the, indo, aryan, languages, suggest, that, dravidian, languages, were, spoken, more, widely, across, the, indian, subcontinent, before, the, spread, of, the, indo, aryan, languages, though, some, scholars, have, argued, that, the, dravidian, languages, may, have, been, brought, to, india, by, migrations, from, the, iranian, plateau, in, the, fourth, or, third, millennium, bce, or, even, earlier, the, reconstructed, vocabulary, of, proto, dravidian, suggests, that, the, family, is, indigenous, to, india, despite, many, attempts, the, family, has, not, been, shown, to, be, related, to, any, other, the, 14th, century, sanskrit, text, lilatilakam, a, grammar, of, manipravalam, states, that, the, spoken, languages, of, present, day, kerala, and, tamil, nadu, were, similar, terming, them, as, drami, a, the, author, does, not, consider, the, kar, a, kannada, and, the, ndhra, telugu, languages, as, drami, a, because, they, were, very, different, from, the, language, of, the, tamil, veda, tiruvaymoli, but, states, that, some, people, would, include, them, in, the, drami, a, category, in, 1816, francis, whyte, ellis, argued, that, tamil, telugu, kannada, malayalam, tulu, and, kodava, descended, from, a, common, non, indo, european, ancestor, he, supported, his, argument, with, a, detailed, comparison, of, non, sanskrit, vocabulary, in, telugu, kannada, and, tamil, and, also, demonstrated, that, they, shared, grammatical, structures, in, 1844, christian, lassen, discovered, that, brahui, was, related, to, these, languages, in, 1856, robert, caldwell, published, his, comparative, grammar, of, the, dravidian, or, south, indian, family, of, languages, which, considerably, expanded, the, dravidian, umbrella, and, established, dravidian, as, one, of, the, major, language, groups, of, the, world, in, 1961, t, burrow, and, m, b, emeneau, published, the, dravidian, etymological, dictionary, with, a, major, revision, in, 1984, caldwell, coined, the, term, dravidian, for, this, family, of, languages, based, on, the, usage, of, the, sanskrit, word, dravi, a, in, the, work, tantrav, rttika, by, kum, rila, bha, a, the, word, i, have, chosen, is, dravidian, from, dr, vi, a, the, adjectival, form, of, dravi, a, this, term, it, is, true, has, sometimes, been, used, and, is, still, sometimes, used, in, almost, as, restricted, a, sense, as, that, of, tamil, itself, so, that, though, on, the, whole, it, is, the, best, term, i, can, find, i, admit, it, is, not, perfectly, free, from, ambiguity, it, is, a, term, which, has, already, been, used, more, or, less, distinctively, by, sanskrit, philologists, as, a, generic, appellation, for, the, south, indian, people, and, their, languages, and, it, is, the, only, single, term, they, ever, seem, to, have, used, in, this, manner, i, have, therefore, no, doubt, of, the, propriety, of, adopting, it, the, origin, of, the, sanskrit, word, dr, vi, a, is, the, tamil, word, tami, kamil, zvelebil, cites, the, forms, such, as, dramila, in, da, in, s, sanskrit, work, avantisundar, kath, and, dami, a, found, in, the, sri, lankan, ceylonese, chronicle, mahavamsa, and, then, goes, on, to, say, the, forms, dami, a, damila, almost, certainly, provide, a, connection, of, dr, a, vi, a, with, the, indigenous, name, of, the, tamil, language, the, likely, derivation, being, tami, dami, dami, a, damila, and, further, with, the, intrusive, hypercorrect, or, perhaps, analogical, r, into, dr, a, vi, a, the, m, v, alternation, is, a, common, enough, phenomenon, in, dravidian, phonology, bhadriraju, krishnamurti, states, in, his, reference, book, the, dravidian, languages, joseph, 1989, ijdl, 18, 2, 134, 42, gives, extensive, references, to, the, use, of, the, term, dravi, a, dramila, first, as, the, name, of, a, people, then, of, a, country, sinhala, bce, inscriptions, cite, dame, a, damela, denoting, tamil, merchants, early, buddhist, and, jaina, sources, used, dami, a, to, refer, to, a, people, of, south, india, presumably, tamil, damilara, ha, was, a, southern, non, aryan, country, drami, a, drami, a, and, dravi, a, were, used, as, variants, to, designate, a, country, in, the, south, b, hatsamhita, k, dambar, da, akum, racarita, fourth, to, seventh, centuries, ce, 1989, 134, 138, it, appears, that, dami, a, was, older, than, dravi, a, which, could, be, its, sanskritization, based, on, what, krishnamurti, states, referring, to, a, scholarly, paper, published, in, the, international, journal, of, dravidian, linguistics, the, sanskrit, word, dravi, a, itself, appeared, later, than, dami, a, since, the, dates, for, the, forms, with, r, are, centuries, later, than, the, dates, for, the, forms, without, r, dami, a, dame, a, damela, etc, the, dravidian, languages, form, a, close, knit, family, most, scholars, agree, on, four, groups, there, are, different, proposals, regarding, the, relationship, between, these, groups, earlier, classifications, grouped, central, and, south, central, dravidian, in, a, single, branch, on, the, other, hand, krishnamurti, groups, south, central, and, south, dravidian, together, there, are, other, disagreements, including, whether, there, is, a, toda, kota, branch, or, whether, kota, diverged, first, and, later, toda, claimed, by, krishnamurti, some, authors, deny, that, north, dravidian, forms, a, valid, subgroup, splitting, it, into, northeast, kurukh, malto, and, northwest, brahui, their, affiliation, has, been, proposed, based, primarily, on, a, small, number, of, common, phonetic, developments, including, mcalpin, 2003, notes, that, no, exact, conditioning, can, be, established, for, the, first, two, changes, and, proposes, that, distinct, proto, dravidian, q, and, k, should, be, reconstructed, behind, these, correspondences, and, that, brahui, kurukh, malto, and, the, rest, of, dravidian, may, be, three, coordinate, branches, possibly, with, brahui, being, the, earliest, language, to, split, off, a, few, morphological, parallels, between, brahui, and, kurukh, malto, are, also, known, but, according, to, mcalpin, they, are, analyzable, as, shared, archaisms, rather, than, shared, innovations, in, addition, glottolog, lists, several, unclassified, dravidian, languages, kumbaran, kakkala, both, of, tamil, malayalam, and, khirwar, a, computational, phylogenetic, study, of, the, dravidian, language, family, was, undertaken, by, kolipakam, et, al, 2018, they, support, the, internal, coherence, of, the, four, dravidian, branches, south, or, south, dravidian, i, south, central, or, south, dravidian, ii, central, and, north, but, is, uncertain, about, the, precise, relationships, of, these, four, branches, to, each, other, the, date, of, dravidian, is, estimated, to, be, 4, 500, years, old, speakers, of, dravidian, languages, by, language, dravidian, languages, are, mostly, located, in, the, southern, and, central, parts, of, south, asia, with, 2, main, outliers, brahui, having, speakers, in, balochistan, and, as, far, north, are, merv, turkmenistan, and, kurukh, to, the, east, in, jharkhand, and, as, far, northeast, as, bhutan, nepal, and, assam, historically, maharashtra, gujarat, and, sindh, also, had, dravidian, speaking, populations, from, the, evidence, of, place, names, like, v, a, li, ko, from, dravidian, pa, i, k, ai, grammatical, features, in, marathi, gujarati, and, sindhi, and, dravidian, like, kinship, systems, in, southern, indo, aryan, languages, proto, dravidian, could, have, been, spoken, in, a, wider, area, perhaps, into, central, india, or, the, western, deccan, which, may, have, had, other, forms, of, early, dravidian, pre, proto, dravidian, or, other, branches, of, dravidian, which, are, currently, unknown, since, 1981, the, census, of, india, has, reported, only, languages, with, more, than, 10, 000, speakers, including, 17, dravidian, languages, in, 1981, these, accounted, for, approximately, 24, of, india, s, population, in, the, 2001, census, they, included, 214, million, people, about, 21, of, india, s, total, population, of, 1, 02, billion, in, addition, the, largest, dravidian, speaking, group, outside, india, tamil, speakers, in, sri, lanka, number, around, 4, 7, million, the, total, number, of, speakers, of, dravidian, languages, is, around, 227, million, people, around, 13, of, the, population, of, the, indian, subcontinent, the, largest, group, of, the, dravidian, languages, is, south, dravidian, with, almost, 150, million, speakers, tamil, kannada, and, malayalam, make, up, around, 98, of, the, speakers, with, 75, million, 44, million, and, 37, million, native, speakers, respectively, the, next, largest, is, the, south, central, branch, which, has, 78, million, native, speakers, the, vast, majority, of, whom, speak, telugu, the, total, number, of, speakers, of, telugu, including, those, whose, first, language, is, not, telugu, is, around, 85, million, people, this, branch, also, includes, the, tribal, language, gondi, spoken, in, central, india, the, second, smallest, branch, is, the, northern, branch, with, around, 6, 3, million, speakers, this, is, the, only, sub, group, to, have, a, language, spoken, in, pakistan, brahui, the, smallest, branch, is, the, central, branch, which, has, only, around, 200, 000, speakers, these, languages, are, mostly, tribal, and, spoken, in, central, india, languages, recognized, as, official, languages, of, india, appear, here, in, boldface, researchers, have, tried, but, have, been, unable, to, prove, a, connection, between, the, dravidian, languages, with, other, language, families, including, indo, european, hurrian, basque, sumerian, korean, and, japanese, comparisons, have, been, made, not, just, with, the, other, language, families, of, the, indian, subcontinent, indo, european, austroasiatic, sino, tibetan, and, nihali, but, with, all, typologically, similar, language, families, of, the, old, world, nonetheless, although, there, are, no, readily, detectable, genealogical, connections, dravidian, shares, several, areal, features, with, the, indo, aryan, languages, which, have, been, attributed, to, the, influence, of, a, dravidian, substratum, on, indo, aryan, dravidian, languages, display, typological, similarities, with, the, uralic, language, group, and, there, have, been, several, attempts, to, establish, a, genetic, relationship, in, the, past, this, idea, has, been, popular, amongst, dravidian, linguists, including, robert, caldwell, thomas, burrow, kamil, zvelebil, and, mikhail, andronov, the, hypothesis, is, however, rejected, by, most, specialists, in, uralic, languages, and, also, in, recent, times, by, dravidian, linguists, such, as, bhadriraju, krishnamurti, in, the, early, 1970s, the, linguist, david, mcalpin, produced, a, detailed, proposal, of, a, genetic, relationship, between, dravidian, and, the, extinct, elamite, language, of, ancient, elam, present, day, southwestern, iran, the, elamo, dravidian, hypothesis, was, supported, in, the, late, 1980s, by, the, archaeologist, colin, renfrew, and, the, geneticist, luigi, luca, cavalli, sforza, who, suggested, that, proto, dravidian, was, brought, to, india, by, farmers, from, the, iranian, part, of, the, fertile, crescent, in, his, 2000, book, cavalli, sforza, suggested, western, india, northern, india, and, northern, iran, as, alternative, starting, points, however, linguists, have, found, mcalpin, s, cognates, unconvincing, and, criticized, his, proposed, phonological, rules, as, ad, hoc, elamite, is, generally, believed, by, scholars, to, be, a, language, isolate, and, the, theory, has, had, no, effect, on, studies, of, the, language, in, 2012, southworth, suggested, a, zagrosian, family, of, west, asian, origin, including, elamite, brahui, and, dravidian, as, its, three, branches, dravidian, is, one, of, the, primary, language, families, in, the, nostratic, proposal, which, would, link, most, languages, in, north, africa, europe, and, western, asia, into, a, family, with, its, origins, in, the, fertile, crescent, sometime, between, the, last, glacial, period, and, the, emergence, of, proto, indo, european, 4, 000, 6, 000, bce, however, the, general, consensus, is, that, such, deep, connections, are, not, or, not, yet, demonstrable, the, origins, of, the, dravidian, languages, as, well, as, their, subsequent, development, and, the, period, of, their, differentiation, are, unclear, partially, due, to, the, lack, of, comparative, linguistic, research, into, the, dravidian, languages, it, is, thought, that, the, dravidian, languages, were, the, most, widespread, indigenous, languages, in, the, indian, subcontinent, before, the, advance, of, the, indo, aryan, languages, though, some, scholars, have, argued, that, the, dravidian, languages, may, have, been, brought, to, india, by, migrations, from, the, iranian, plateau, in, the, fourth, or, third, millennium, bce, or, even, earlier, reconstructed, proto, dravidian, vocabulary, suggests, that, the, family, is, indigenous, to, india, as, a, proto, language, the, proto, dravidian, language, is, not, itself, attested, in, the, historical, record, its, modern, conception, is, based, solely, on, reconstruction, it, was, suggested, in, the, 1980s, that, the, language, was, spoken, in, the, 4th, millennium, bce, and, started, disintegrating, into, various, branches, around, the, 3rd, millennium, bce, according, to, krishnamurti, proto, dravidian, may, have, been, spoken, in, the, indus, civilization, suggesting, a, tentative, date, of, proto, dravidian, around, the, early, part, of, the, third, millennium, krishnamurti, further, states, that, south, dravidian, i, including, pre, tamil, and, south, dravidian, ii, including, pre, telugu, split, around, the, 11th, century, bce, with, the, other, major, branches, splitting, off, at, around, the, same, time, kolipakam, et, al, 2018, give, a, similar, estimate, of, 2, 500, bce, for, proto, dravidian, historically, maharashtra, gujarat, and, sindh, also, had, dravidian, speaking, populations, from, the, evidence, of, place, names, like, v, a, li, ko, from, dravidian, pa, i, k, ai, grammatical, features, in, marathi, gujarati, and, sindhi, and, dravidian, like, kinship, systems, in, southern, indo, aryan, languages, proto, dravidian, could, have, been, spoken, in, a, wider, area, perhaps, into, central, india, or, the, western, deccan, which, may, have, had, other, forms, of, early, dravidian, pre, proto, dravidian, or, other, branches, of, dravidian, which, are, currently, unknown, several, geneticists, have, noted, a, strong, correlation, between, dravidian, and, the, ancestral, south, indian, asi, component, of, south, asian, genetic, makeup, narasimhan, et, al, 2019, argue, that, the, asi, component, itself, formed, in, the, early, 2nd, millennium, bce, from, a, mixture, of, a, population, associated, with, the, indus, valley, civilization, and, a, population, resident, in, peninsular, india, they, conclude, that, one, of, these, two, groups, may, have, been, the, source, of, proto, dravidian, an, indus, valley, origin, would, be, consistent, with, the, location, of, brahui, and, with, attempts, to, interpret, the, indus, script, as, dravidian, on, the, other, hand, reconstructed, proto, dravidian, terms, for, flora, and, fauna, provide, support, for, a, peninsular, indian, origin, the, indus, valley, civilisation, 3300, 1900, bce, located, in, the, indus, valley, region, is, sometimes, suggested, to, have, been, dravidian, already, in, 1924, after, discovering, the, indus, valley, civilisation, john, marshall, stated, that, one, of, the, language, s, may, have, been, dravidic, cultural, and, linguistic, similarities, have, been, cited, by, researchers, henry, heras, kamil, zvelebil, asko, parpola, and, iravatham, mahadevan, as, being, strong, evidence, for, a, proto, dravidian, origin, of, the, ancient, indus, valley, civilisation, the, discovery, in, tamil, nadu, of, a, late, neolithic, early, 2nd, millennium, bce, i, e, post, dating, harappan, decline, stone, celt, allegedly, marked, with, indus, signs, has, been, considered, by, some, to, be, significant, for, the, dravidian, identification, yuri, knorozov, surmised, that, the, symbols, represent, a, logosyllabic, script, and, suggested, based, on, computer, analysis, an, underlying, agglutinative, dravidian, language, as, the, most, likely, candidate, for, the, underlying, language, knorozov, s, suggestion, was, preceded, by, the, work, of, henry, heras, who, suggested, several, readings, of, signs, based, on, a, proto, dravidian, assumption, linguist, asko, parpola, writes, that, the, indus, script, and, harappan, language, are, most, likely, to, have, belonged, to, the, dravidian, family, parpola, led, a, finnish, team, in, investigating, the, inscriptions, using, computer, analysis, based, on, a, proto, dravidian, assumption, they, proposed, readings, of, many, signs, some, agreeing, with, the, suggested, readings, of, heras, and, knorozov, such, as, equating, the, fish, sign, with, the, dravidian, word, for, fish, min, but, disagreeing, on, several, other, readings, a, comprehensive, description, of, parpola, s, work, until, 1994, is, given, in, his, book, deciphering, the, indus, script, although, in, modern, times, speakers, of, the, various, dravidian, languages, have, mainly, occupied, the, southern, portion, of, india, in, earlier, times, they, probably, were, spoken, in, a, larger, area, after, the, indo, aryan, migrations, into, north, western, india, starting, c, 1500, bce, and, the, establishment, of, the, kuru, kingdom, c, 1100, bce, a, process, of, sanskritisation, of, the, masses, started, which, resulted, in, a, language, shift, in, northern, india, southern, india, has, remained, majority, dravidian, but, pockets, of, dravidian, can, be, found, in, central, india, pakistan, bangladesh, and, nepal, the, kurukh, and, malto, are, pockets, of, dravidian, languages, in, central, india, spoken, by, people, who, may, have, migrated, from, south, india, they, do, have, myths, about, external, origins, the, kurukh, have, traditionally, claimed, to, be, from, the, deccan, peninsula, more, specifically, karnataka, the, same, tradition, has, existed, of, the, brahui, who, call, themselves, immigrants, holding, this, same, view, of, the, brahui, are, many, scholars, such, as, l, h, horace, perera, and, m, ratnasabapathy, the, brahui, population, of, pakistan, s, balochistan, province, has, been, taken, by, some, as, the, linguistic, equivalent, of, a, relict, population, perhaps, indicating, that, dravidian, languages, were, formerly, much, more, widespread, and, were, supplanted, by, the, incoming, indo, aryan, languages, however, it, has, been, argued, that, the, absence, of, any, old, iranian, avestan, loanwords, in, brahui, suggests, that, the, brahui, migrated, to, balochistan, from, central, india, less, than, 1, 000, years, ago, the, main, iranian, contributor, to, brahui, vocabulary, balochi, is, a, western, iranian, language, like, kurdish, and, arrived, in, the, area, from, the, west, only, around, 1000, ce, sound, changes, shared, with, kurukh, and, malto, also, suggest, that, brahui, was, originally, spoken, near, them, in, central, india, dravidian, languages, show, extensive, lexical, vocabulary, borrowing, but, only, a, few, traits, of, structural, either, phonological, or, grammatical, borrowing, from, indo, aryan, whereas, indo, aryan, shows, more, structural, than, lexical, borrowings, from, the, dravidian, languages, many, of, these, features, are, already, present, in, the, oldest, known, indo, aryan, language, the, language, of, the, rigveda, c, 1500, bce, which, also, includes, over, a, dozen, words, borrowed, from, dravidian, vedic, sanskrit, has, retroflex, consonants, with, about, 88, words, in, the, rigveda, having, unconditioned, retroflexes, some, sample, words, are, i, anta, ka, va, aka, keva, a, pu, ya, and, ma, ka, since, other, indo, european, languages, including, other, indo, iranian, languages, lack, retroflex, consonants, their, presence, in, indo, aryan, is, often, cited, as, evidence, of, substrate, influence, from, close, contact, of, the, vedic, speakers, with, speakers, of, a, foreign, language, family, rich, in, retroflex, consonants, the, dravidian, family, is, a, serious, candidate, since, it, is, rich, in, retroflex, phonemes, reconstructible, back, to, the, proto, dravidian, stage, in, addition, a, number, of, grammatical, features, of, vedic, sanskrit, not, found, in, its, sister, avestan, language, appear, to, have, been, borrowed, from, dravidian, languages, these, include, the, gerund, which, has, the, same, function, as, in, dravidian, some, linguists, explain, this, asymmetrical, borrowing, by, arguing, that, middle, indo, aryan, languages, were, built, on, a, dravidian, substratum, these, scholars, argue, that, the, most, plausible, explanation, for, the, presence, of, dravidian, structural, features, in, indic, is, language, shift, that, is, native, dravidian, speakers, learning, and, adopting, indic, languages, due, to, elite, dominance, although, each, of, the, innovative, traits, in, indic, could, be, accounted, for, by, internal, explanations, early, dravidian, influence, is, the, only, explanation, that, can, account, for, all, of, the, innovations, at, once, moreover, it, accounts, for, several, of, the, innovative, traits, in, indic, better, than, any, internal, explanation, that, has, been, proposed, proto, dravidian, unlike, sanskrit, and, other, indo, iranian, languages, languages, of, south, asia, lacked, both, an, aspiration, and, voicing, contrast, the, situation, varies, considerably, amongst, its, daughter, languages, and, often, also, between, registers, of, any, single, language, the, vast, majority, of, modern, dravidian, languages, generally, have, some, voicing, distinctions, amongst, stops, as, for, aspiration, it, appears, in, at, least, the, formal, varieties, of, the, so, called, literary, dravidian, languages, except, tamil, today, but, may, be, rare, or, entirely, absent, in, less, formal, registers, as, well, as, in, the, many, non, literary, dravidian, languages, at, one, extreme, tamil, like, proto, dravidian, does, not, phonemically, distinguish, between, voiced, and, voiceless, or, unaspirated, and, aspirated, sounds, even, in, formal, speech, in, fact, the, tamil, alphabet, lacks, symbols, for, voiced, and, aspirated, stops, at, the, other, end, brahui, is, exceptional, among, the, dravidian, languages, in, possessing, and, commonly, employing, the, entire, inventory, of, aspirates, employed, in, neighboring, sindhi, while, aspirates, are, particularly, concentrated, in, the, indo, aryan, element, of, the, lexicon, some, brahui, words, with, dravidian, roots, have, developed, aspiration, as, well, most, languages, lie, in, between, voicing, contrasts, are, quite, common, in, all, registers, of, speech, in, most, dravidian, languages, aspiration, contrasts, are, less, common, but, relatively, well, established, in, the, phonologies, of, the, higher, or, more, formal, registers, as, well, as, in, the, standard, orthographies, of, the, literary, languages, other, than, tamil, telugu, kannada, and, malayalam, however, in, colloquial, or, non, standard, speech, aspiration, often, appears, inconsistently, or, not, at, all, even, if, it, occurs, in, the, standard, spelling, of, the, word, in, the, languages, in, which, aspirates, are, found, they, primarily, occur, in, the, large, numbers, of, loanwords, from, sanskrit, and, other, indo, iranian, languages, though, some, are, found, in, etymologically, native, words, as, well, often, as, the, result, of, plosive, laryngeal, clusters, being, reanalyzed, as, aspirates, e, g, telugu, nalabhai, kannada, emb, h, attu, adilabad, gondi, ph, d, dravidian, languages, are, also, historically, characterized, by, a, three, way, distinction, between, dental, alveolar, and, retroflex, places, of, articulation, as, well, as, large, numbers, of, liquids, currently, the, three, way, coronal, distinction, is, only, found, in, malayalam, and, the, various, languages, of, the, nilgiri, mountains, all, of, which, belong, to, the, tamil, kannada, branch, of, the, family, all, other, dravidian, languages, maintain, only, a, two, way, distinction, between, dentals, and, retroflexes, largely, the, result, of, merging, the, alveolars, with, the, dentals, or, retroflexes, or, via, rhotacization, the, latter, is, found, primarily, among, the, south, and, south, central, languages, where, many, languages, merged, the, singular, proto, dravidian, alveolar, plosive, with, the, alveolar, trill, r, subsequently, in, some, of, these, languages, the, trill, evolved, into, the, alveolar, tap, or, underwent, other, sound, changes, tulu, has, d, d, as, reflexes, manda, kui, has, d, and, hill, maria, gondi, has, proto, dravidian, had, five, short, and, long, vowels, a, i, u, e, o, there, were, no, diphthongs, ai, and, au, are, treated, as, ay, and, av, or, aw, the, five, vowel, system, with, phonemic, length, is, largely, preserved, in, the, descendant, subgroups, but, there, are, some, notable, exceptions, the, nilgiri, languages, except, kota, but, including, kodagu, developing, a, series, of, central, vowels, which, formed, from, vowels, near, retroflex, and, alveolar, consonants, the, short, u, phoneme, mostly, word, finally, became, and, also, became, phonemic, in, tulu, and, malayalam, mostly, caused, by, loaning, words, with, rounded, u, brahui, has, slightly, poorer, vowel, system, where, short, e, and, o, merged, with, other, vowels, due, to, the, influence, of, indo, aryan, languages, leaving, only, long, counterparts, the, following, consonantal, phonemes, are, reconstructed, the, most, characteristic, grammatical, features, of, dravidian, languages, are, the, dravidian, languages, have, two, numbers, singular, and, plural, the, singular, is, unmarked, the, plural, is, expressed, by, a, suffix, the, plural, suffixes, are, n, k, k, a, cf, kui, k, i, ga, cows, brahui, b, k, mouths, cf, telugu, mr, nu, lu, trees, ollari, ki, l, hands, and, the, combination, of, these, two, n, k, k, a, common, in, sd, cf, tamil, mara, ka, trees, kannada, mara, ga, u, trees, the, individual, dravidian, languages, have, different, gender, systems, what, they, have, in, common, is, that, the, grammatical, gender, genus, always, corresponds, to, the, natural, gender, of, the, word, in, addition, to, individual, special, developments, there, are, three, main, types, in, which, the, categories, male, or, non, male, as, well, as, human, and, non, human, play, a, central, role, the, three, types, are, illustrated, by, the, forms, of, the, third, person, demonstrative, pronouns, of, the, three, languages, there, is, no, consensus, as, to, which, of, these, three, types, is, the, original, the, gender, is, not, explicitly, marked, for, all, nouns, thus, in, telugu, anna, elder, brother, is, masculine, and, amma, mother, non, masculine, without, this, being, apparent, from, the, pure, form, of, the, word, however, many, nouns, are, formed, with, certain, suffixes, that, express, gender, and, number, for, proto, dravidian, the, suffixes, an, and, an, could, be, used, for, the, masculine, singular, cf, tamil, mak, a, son, telugu, tammu, u, younger, brother, a, and, i, for, the, singular, feminine, cf, kannada, mag, a, daughter, malto, maq, i, girl, and, ar, for, human, plurals, cf, malayalam, iru, var, two, persons, kurukh, l, ar, men, case, is, expressed, by, suffixes, and, more, loosely, connected, postpositions, the, number, of, cases, varies, between, four, telugu, and, eleven, brahui, the, nominative, is, always, the, unmarked, base, form, of, the, word, the, other, cases, collectively, called, oblique, are, formed, by, adding, suffixes, to, a, stem, that, can, either, be, identical, to, the, nominative, or, formed, by, certain, suffixes, e, g, tamil, maram, tree, oblique, mara, tt, several, oblique, suffixes, can, be, reconstructed, for, proto, dravidian, which, are, composed, of, the, minimal, components, i, a, n, and, tt, in, many, languages, the, oblique, is, identical, to, the, genitive, proto, dravidian, case, suffixes, can, be, reconstructed, for, the, three, cases, accusative, dative, and, genitive, other, case, suffixes, only, occur, in, individual, branches, of, dravidian, personal, pronouns, occur, in, the, 1st, and, 2nd, person, in, the, 1st, person, plural, there, is, an, inclusive, and, exclusive, form, that, is, a, distinction, is, made, as, to, whether, the, person, addressed, is, included, there, is, also, a, reflexive, pronoun, that, refers, to, the, subject, of, the, sentence, and, is, constructed, in, the, same, way, as, personal, pronouns, the, personal, and, reflexive, pronouns, reconstructed, for, proto, dravidian, are, listed, in, the, table, below, in, addition, there, are, special, developments, in, some, languages, the, south, and, south, central, dravidian, languages, have, transferred, the, initial, sound, of, the, 1st, person, plural, inclusive, to, the, 1st, person, singular, cf, malayalam, n, but, oblique, en, yan, the, differences, between, the, forms, for, the, inclusive, and, exclusive, we, are, partly, blurred, kannada, has, completely, abandoned, this, distinction, the, languages, of, the, tamil, kodagu, group, have, formed, a, new, exclusive, we, by, adding, the, plural, suffix, cf, tamil, n, m, we, incl, n, ka, we, excl, the, demonstrative, pronouns, also, serve, as, personal, pronouns, of, the, 3rd, person, they, consist, of, an, initial, vowel, expressing, the, distance, and, a, suffix, expressing, number, and, gender, there, are, three, levels, of, distance, the, far, distance, is, formed, with, the, initial, vowel, a, the, middle, distance, with, u, and, the, near, distance, with, i, the, same, deictic, elements, also, occur, in, local, here, there, and, temporal, adverbs, now, then, the, original, threefold, distinction, of, the, distance, e, g, kota, avn, he, that, one, n, he, this, one, ivn, he, this, one, has, only, survived, in, a, few, languages, spoken, today, the, yonder, distance, u, has, mostly, become, obsolete, instead, a, and, i, are, used, interrogative, pronouns, are, formed, analogously, to, the, demonstrative, pronouns, and, are, characterized, by, the, initial, syllable, ya, e, g, kota, evn, which, tamil, telugu, made, another, word, n, for, the, 1sg, pronoun, back, formed, from, 1p, inclusive, m, in, parallel, to, y, n, some, languages, like, tamil, retain, both, forms, y, n, the, dravidian, verb, is, formed, by, adding, tense, mood, and, personal, suffixes, to, the, root, of, the, word, thus, the, tamil, word, varuki, i, come, is, composed, of, the, verb, stem, varu, the, present, suffix, ki, and, the, suffix, of, the, 1st, person, singular, in, proto, dravidian, there, are, only, two, tenses, past, and, not, past, while, many, daughter, languages, have, developed, a, more, complex, tense, system, the, negation, is, expressed, synthetically, by, a, special, negative, verb, form, cf, konda, kitan, he, made, ki, etan, he, did, not, the, verb, stem, can, be, modified, by, stem, forming, suffixes, in, many, dravidian, languages, thus, malto, derives, from, the, stem, nud, to, hide, the, reflexive, verb, stem, nud, r, to, hide, infinite, verb, forms, depend, on, either, a, following, verb, or, a, following, noun, they, serve, to, form, more, complex, syntactic, constructions, verbal, compounds, can, be, formed, in, dravidian, for, example, the, tamil, kon, uvara, to, bring, is, composed, of, an, infinite, form, of, the, verb, ko, a, to, hold, and, the, verb, vara, to, come, characteristic, of, the, dravidian, languages, is, a, fixed, subject, object, verb, word, order, sov, accordingly, the, subject, comes, first, in, the, sentence, it, can, at, most, be, preceded, by, circumstantial, determinations, of, time, and, place, and, the, predicate, always, at, the, end, of, the, sentence, as, is, characteristic, of, sov, languages, in, the, dravidian, languages, attributes, always, come, before, their, noun, subordinate, clauses, before, main, clauses, main, verbs, before, auxiliary, verbs, and, postpositions, are, used, instead, of, prepositions, only, in, the, north, dravidian, languages, has, the, rigid, sov, word, order, been, relaxed, a, simple, sentence, consists, of, a, subject, and, a, predicate, which, can, be, either, a, verb, or, a, noun, there, is, no, copula, in, dravidian, the, subject, is, usually, in, the, nominative, case, but, in, many, dravidian, languages, in, a, sentence, expressing, a, feeling, perception, or, possession, the, subject, is, also, in, the, dative, case, in, all, dravidian, languages, except, malayalam, a, verbal, predicate, agrees, with, a, nominative, subject, kui, and, kuwi, developed, a, system, of, congruence, between, object, and, verb, in, some, dravidian, languages, old, tamil, gondi, even, a, nominal, predicate, takes, personal, endings, examples, of, simple, sentences, from, tamil, complex, sentences, consist, of, a, main, clause, and, one, or, more, subordinate, clauses, in, general, a, sentence, can, contain, only, one, finite, verb, the, dravidian, languages, have, no, conjunctions, subordinate, clauses, are, formed, just, like, parataxes, by, infinite, verb, forms, these, include, the, infinitive, the, verbal, participle, which, expresses, a, sequence, of, actions, and, the, conditional, which, expresses, a, conditionality, relative, clauses, correspond, to, constructions, with, the, so, called, adnominal, participles, examples, from, tamil, these, constructions, are, not, possible, for, subordinate, clauses, with, a, nominal, predicate, since, no, infinite, forms, can, be, formed, for, a, noun, here, one, gets, by, with, the, so, called, quotative, verb, usually, an, infinite, form, of, to, say, through, which, the, nominal, subordinate, clause, is, embedded, in, the, sentence, structure, example, from, tamil, word, roots, seem, to, have, been, monosyllabic, in, proto, dravidian, as, a, rule, proto, dravidian, words, could, be, simple, derived, or, compound, iterative, compounds, could, be, formed, by, doubling, a, word, cf, tamil, avar, he, and, avaravar, everyone, or, vantu, coming, and, vantu, vantu, always, coming, a, special, form, of, reduplicated, compounds, are, the, so, called, echo, words, in, which, the, first, syllable, of, the, second, word, is, replaced, by, ki, cf, tamil, pustakam, book, and, pustakam, kistakam, books, and, the, like, today, s, dravidian, languages, have, in, addition, to, the, inherited, dravidian, vocabulary, a, large, number, of, words, from, sanskrit, or, later, indo, aryan, languages, in, tamil, they, make, up, a, relatively, small, proportion, not, least, because, of, targeted, linguistic, puristic, tendencies, in, the, early, 20th, century, while, in, telugu, and, malayalam, the, number, of, indo, aryan, loanwords, is, large, in, brahui, which, was, strongly, influenced, by, its, neighboring, languages, due, to, its, distance, from, the, other, dravidian, languages, only, a, tenth, of, the, vocabulary, is, of, dravidian, origin, more, recently, like, all, the, languages, of, india, the, dravidian, languages, also, have, words, borrowed, from, english, on, a, large, scale, less, numerous, are, the, loanwords, from, portuguese, dravidian, words, that, have, found, their, way, into, english, are, orange, via, sanskrit, n, ra, ga, cf, tamil, n, ra, k, y, n, ram, k, y, catamaran, tamil, ka, umaram, bound, logs, mango, tamil, m, k, y, malayalam, m, a, via, portuguese, manga, mongoose, telugu, mu, gisa, kannada, mu, gisi, and, curry, tamil, ka, i, the, numerals, from, 1, to, 10, in, various, dravidian, and, indo, iranian, languages, here, exemplified, by, indo, aryan, language, sanskrit, and, iranian, language, persian, o, u, nu, four, dravidian, languages, viz, tamil, kannada, telugu, and, malayalam, have, lengthy, literary, traditions, literature, in, tulu, and, kodava, is, more, recent, recently, old, literature, in, gondi, has, been, discovered, as, well, the, earliest, known, dravidian, inscriptions, are, 76, old, tamil, inscriptions, on, cave, walls, in, madurai, and, tirunelveli, districts, in, tamil, nadu, dating, from, the, 2nd, century, bce, these, inscriptions, are, written, in, a, variant, of, the, brahmi, script, called, tamil, brahmi, in, 2019, the, tamil, nadu, archaeology, department, released, a, report, on, excavations, at, keeladi, near, madurai, tamil, nadu, including, a, description, of, potsherds, dated, to, the, 6th, century, bce, inscribed, with, personal, names, in, the, tamil, brahmi, script, however, the, report, lacks, the, detail, of, a, full, archaeological, study, and, other, archaeologists, have, disputed, whether, the, oldest, dates, obtained, for, the, site, can, be, assigned, to, these, potsherds, the, earliest, long, text, in, old, tamil, is, the, tolk, ppiyam, a, work, on, tamil, grammar, and, poetics, preserved, in, a, 5th, century, ce, redaction, whose, oldest, layers, could, date, from, the, late, 2nd, century, or, 1st, century, bce, kannada, s, earliest, known, inscription, is, the, lion, balustrade, simhakatanjana, inscription, excavated, at, the, pranaveshwara, temple, complex, at,
