a, legal, custom, is, the, established, pattern, of, behavior, within, a, particular, social, setting, a, claim, can, be, carried, out, in, defense, of, what, has, always, been, done, and, accepted, by, law, customary, law, also, consuetudinary, or, unofficial, law, exists, where, most, customary, laws, deal, with, standards, of, the, community, that, have, been, long, established, in, a, given, locale, however, the, term, can, also, apply, to, areas, of, international, law, where, certain, standards, have, been, nearly, universal, in, their, acceptance, as, correct, bases, of, action, for, example, laws, against, piracy, or, slavery, see, hostis, humani, generis, in, many, though, not, all, instances, customary, laws, will, have, supportive, court, rulings, and, case, law, that, have, evolved, over, time, to, give, additional, weight, to, their, rule, as, law, and, also, to, demonstrate, the, trajectory, of, evolution, if, any, in, the, interpretation, of, such, law, by, relevant, courts, a, central, issue, regarding, the, recognition, of, custom, is, determining, the, appropriate, methodology, to, know, what, practices, and, norms, actually, constitute, customary, law, it, is, not, immediately, clear, that, classic, western, theories, of, jurisprudence, can, be, reconciled, in, any, useful, way, with, conceptual, analyses, of, customary, law, and, thus, some, scholars, like, john, comaroff, and, simon, roberts, have, characterized, customary, law, norms, in, their, own, terms, yet, there, clearly, remains, some, disagreement, which, is, seen, in, john, hund, s, critique, of, comaroff, and, roberts, theory, and, preference, for, the, contributions, of, h, l, a, hart, hund, argues, that, hart, s, the, concept, of, law, solves, the, conceptual, problem, with, which, scholars, who, have, attempted, to, articulate, how, customary, law, principles, may, be, identified, defined, and, how, they, operate, in, regulating, social, behavior, and, resolving, disputes, customary, law, is, the, set, of, customs, practices, and, beliefs, that, are, accepted, as, obligatory, rules, of, conduct, by, a, community, comaroff, and, roberts, famous, work, rules, and, processes, attempted, to, detail, the, body, of, norms, that, constitute, tswana, law, in, a, way, that, was, less, legalistic, or, rule, oriented, than, had, isaac, schapera, they, defined, mekgwa, le, melao, ya, setswana, in, terms, of, casalis, and, ellenberger, s, definition, melao, therefore, being, rules, pronounced, by, a, chief, and, mekgwa, as, norms, that, become, customary, law, through, traditional, usage, importantly, however, they, noted, that, the, tswana, seldom, attempt, to, classify, the, vast, array, of, existing, norms, into, categories, and, they, thus, termed, this, the, undifferentiated, nature, of, the, normative, repertoire, moreover, they, observe, the, co, existence, of, overtly, incompatible, norms, that, may, breed, conflict, either, due, to, circumstances, in, a, particular, situation, or, inherently, due, to, their, incongruous, content, this, lack, of, rule, classification, and, failure, to, eradicate, internal, inconsistencies, between, potentially, conflicting, norms, allows, for, much, flexibility, in, dispute, settlement, and, is, also, viewed, as, a, strategic, resource, for, disputants, who, seek, to, advance, their, own, success, in, a, case, the, latter, incongruities, especially, inconsistencies, of, norm, content, are, typically, solved, by, elevating, one, of, the, norms, tacitly, from, the, literal, to, the, symbolic, this, allows, for, the, accommodation, of, both, as, they, now, theoretically, exist, in, different, realms, of, reality, this, is, highly, contextual, which, further, illustrates, that, norms, cannot, be, viewed, in, isolation, and, are, open, to, negotiation, thus, although, there, are, a, small, number, of, so, called, non, negotiable, norms, the, vast, majority, are, viewed, and, given, substance, contextually, which, is, seen, as, fundamental, to, the, tswana, comaroff, and, roberts, describe, how, outcomes, of, specific, cases, have, the, ability, to, change, the, normative, repertoire, as, the, repertoire, of, norms, is, seen, to, be, both, in, a, state, of, formation, and, transformation, at, all, times, these, changes, are, justified, on, the, grounds, that, they, are, merely, giving, recognition, to, de, facto, observations, of, transformation, furthermore, the, legitimacy, of, a, chief, is, a, direct, determinant, of, the, legitimacy, of, his, decisions, in, the, formulation, of, legislative, pronouncements, as, opposed, to, decisions, made, in, dispute, resolution, the, chief, first, speaks, of, the, proposed, norm, with, his, advisors, then, council, of, headmen, then, the, public, assembly, debate, the, proposed, law, and, may, accept, or, reject, it, a, chief, can, proclaim, the, law, even, if, the, public, assembly, rejects, it, but, this, is, not, often, done, and, if, the, chief, proclaims, the, legislation, against, the, will, of, the, public, assembly, the, legislation, will, become, melao, however, it, is, unlikely, that, it, will, be, executed, because, its, effectiveness, depends, on, the, chief, s, legitimacy, and, the, norm, s, consistency, with, the, practices, and, changes, in, social, relations, and, will, of, the, people, under, that, chief, regarding, the, invocation, of, norms, in, disputes, comaroff, and, roberts, used, the, term, paradigm, of, argument, to, refer, to, the, linguistic, and, conceptual, frame, used, by, a, disputant, whereby, a, coherent, picture, of, relevant, events, and, actions, in, terms, of, one, or, more, implicit, or, explicit, normative, referents, is, created, in, their, explanation, the, complainant, who, always, speaks, first, thus, establishes, a, paradigm, the, defendant, can, either, accept, and, therefore, argue, within, that, specific, paradigm, or, reject, and, therefore, introduce, his, or, her, own, paradigm, usually, the, facts, are, not, contested, here, if, the, defendant, means, to, change, the, paradigm, they, will, refer, to, norms, as, such, where, actually, norms, are, not, ordinarily, explicitly, referenced, in, tswana, dispute, resolution, as, the, audience, would, typically, already, know, them, and, just, the, way, one, presents, one, s, case, and, constructs, the, facts, will, establish, one, s, paradigm, the, headman, or, chief, adjudicating, may, also, do, same, accept, the, normative, basis, implied, by, the, parties, or, one, of, them, and, thus, not, refer, to, norms, using, explicit, language, but, rather, isolate, a, factual, issue, in, the, dispute, and, then, make, a, decision, on, it, without, expressly, referring, to, any, norms, or, impose, a, new, or, different, paradigm, onto, the, parties, hund, finds, comaroff, and, roberts, flexibility, thesis, of, a, repertoire, of, norms, from, which, litigants, and, adjudicator, choose, in, the, process, of, negotiating, solutions, between, them, uncompelling, he, is, therefore, concerned, with, disproving, what, he, calls, rule, scepticism, on, their, part, he, notes, that, the, concept, of, custom, generally, denotes, convergent, behaviour, but, not, all, customs, have, the, force, of, law, hund, therefore, draws, from, hart, s, analysis, distinguishing, social, rules, which, have, internal, and, external, aspects, from, habits, which, have, only, external, aspects, internal, aspects, are, the, reflective, attitude, on, the, part, of, adherents, toward, certain, behaviours, perceived, to, be, obligatory, according, to, a, common, standard, external, aspects, manifest, in, regular, observable, behaviour, but, is, not, obligatory, in, hart, s, analysis, then, social, rules, amount, to, custom, that, has, legal, force, hart, identifies, three, further, differences, between, habits, and, binding, social, rules, first, a, social, rule, exists, where, society, frowns, on, deviation, from, the, habit, and, attempts, to, prevent, departures, by, criticising, such, behaviour, second, when, this, criticism, is, seen, socially, as, a, good, reason, for, adhering, to, the, habit, and, it, is, welcomed, and, third, when, members, of, a, group, behave, in, a, common, way, not, only, out, of, habit, or, because, everyone, else, is, doing, it, but, because, it, is, seen, to, be, a, common, standard, that, should, be, followed, at, least, by, some, members, hund, however, acknowledges, the, difficulty, of, an, outsider, knowing, the, dimensions, of, these, criteria, that, depend, on, an, internal, point, of, view, for, hund, the, first, form, of, rule, scepticism, concerns, the, widely, held, opinion, that, because, the, content, of, customary, law, derives, from, practice, there, are, actually, no, objective, rules, since, it, is, only, behaviour, that, informs, their, construction, on, this, view, it, is, impossible, to, distinguish, between, behaviour, that, is, rule, bound, and, behaviour, that, is, not, i, e, which, behaviour, is, motivated, by, adherence, to, law, or, at, least, done, in, recognition, of, the, law, and, is, merely, a, response, to, other, factors, hund, sees, this, as, problematic, because, it, makes, quantifying, the, law, almost, impossible, since, behaviour, is, obviously, inconsistent, hund, argues, that, this, is, a, misconception, based, on, a, failure, to, acknowledge, the, importance, of, the, internal, element, in, his, view, by, using, the, criteria, described, above, there, is, not, this, problem, in, deciphering, what, constitutes, law, in, a, particular, community, according, to, hund, the, second, form, of, rule, scepticism, says, that, though, a, community, may, have, rules, those, rules, are, not, arrived, at, deductively, i, e, they, are, not, created, through, legal, moral, reasoning, only, but, are, instead, driven, by, the, personal, political, motives, of, those, who, create, them, the, scope, for, such, influence, is, created, by, the, loose, and, undefined, nature, of, customary, law, which, hund, argues, grants, customary, lawmakers, often, through, traditional, judicial, processes, a, wide, discretion, in, its, application, yet, hund, contends, that, the, fact, that, rules, might, sometimes, be, arrived, at, in, the, more, ad, hoc, way, does, not, mean, that, this, defines, the, system, if, one, requires, a, perfect, system, where, laws, are, created, only, deductively, then, one, is, left, with, a, system, with, no, rules, for, hund, this, cannot, be, so, and, an, explanation, for, these, kinds, of, law, making, processes, is, found, in, hart, s, conception, of, secondary, rules, rules, in, terms, of, which, the, main, body, of, norms, are, recognised, hund, therefore, says, that, for, some, cultures, for, instance, in, some, sections, of, tswana, society, the, secondary, rules, have, developed, only, to, the, point, where, laws, are, determined, with, reference, to, politics, and, personal, preference, this, does, not, mean, that, they, are, not, rules, hund, argues, that, if, we, acknowledge, a, developmental, pattern, in, societies, constructions, of, these, secondary, rules, then, we, can, understand, how, this, society, constructs, its, laws, and, how, it, differs, from, societies, that, have, come, to, rely, on, an, objective, stand, alone, body, of, rules, the, modern, codification, of, civil, law, developed, from, the, tradition, of, medieval, custumals, collections, of, local, customary, law, that, developed, in, a, specific, manorial, or, borough, jurisdiction, and, which, were, slowly, pieced, together, mainly, from, case, law, and, later, written, down, by, local, jurists, custumals, acquired, the, force, of, law, when, they, became, the, undisputed, rule, by, which, certain, rights, entitlements, and, obligations, were, regulated, between, members, of, a, community, some, examples, include, bracton, s, de, legibus, et, consuetudinibus, angliae, for, england, the, coutume, de, paris, for, the, city, of, paris, the, sachsenspiegel, for, northern, germany, and, the, many, fueros, of, spain, in, international, law, customary, law, refers, to, the, law, of, nations, or, the, legal, norms, that, have, developed, through, the, customary, exchanges, between, states, over, time, whether, based, on, diplomacy, or, aggression, essentially, legal, obligations, are, believed, to, arise, between, states, to, carry, out, their, affairs, consistently, with, past, accepted, conduct, these, customs, can, also, change, based, on, the, acceptance, or, rejection, by, states, of, particular, acts, some, principles, of, customary, law, have, achieved, the, force, of, peremptory, norms, which, cannot, be, violated, or, altered, except, by, a, norm, of, comparable, strength, these, norms, are, said, to, gain, their, strength, from, universal, acceptance, such, as, the, prohibitions, against, genocide, and, slavery, customary, international, law, can, be, distinguished, from, treaty, law, which, consists, of, explicit, agreements, between, nations, to, assume, obligations, however, many, treaties, are, attempts, to, codify, pre, existing, customary, law, customary, law, is, a, recognized, source, of, law, within, jurisdictions, of, the, civil, law, tradition, where, it, may, be, subordinate, to, both, statutes, and, regulations, in, addressing, custom, as, a, source, of, law, within, the, civil, law, tradition, john, henry, merryman, notes, that, though, the, attention, it, is, given, in, scholarly, works, is, great, its, importance, is, slight, and, decreasing, on, the, other, hand, in, many, countries, around, the, world, one, or, more, types, of, customary, law, continue, to, exist, side, by, side, with, official, law, a, condition, referred, to, as, legal, pluralism, see, also, list, of, national, legal, systems, in, the, canon, law, of, the, catholic, church, custom, is, a, source, of, law, canonical, jurisprudence, however, differs, from, civil, law, jurisprudence, in, requiring, the, express, or, implied, consent, of, the, legislator, for, a, custom, to, obtain, the, force, of, law, in, the, english, common, law, long, usage, must, be, established, it, is, a, broad, principle, of, property, law, that, if, something, has, gone, on, for, a, long, time, without, objection, whether, it, be, using, a, right, of, way, or, occupying, land, to, which, one, has, no, title, the, law, will, eventually, recognise, the, fact, and, give, the, person, doing, it, the, legal, right, to, continue, it, is, known, in, case, law, as, customary, rights, something, which, has, been, practised, since, time, immemorial, by, reference, to, a, particular, locality, may, acquire, the, legal, status, of, a, custom, which, is, a, form, of, local, law, the, legal, criteria, defining, a, custom, are, precise, the, most, common, claim, in, recent, times, is, for, customary, rights, to, moor, a, vessel, the, mooring, must, have, been, in, continuous, use, for, time, immemorial, which, is, defined, by, legal, precedent, as, 12, years, or, 20, years, for, crown, land, for, the, same, purpose, by, people, using, them, for, that, purpose, to, give, two, examples, a, custom, of, mooring, which, might, have, been, established, in, past, times, for, over, two, hundred, years, by, the, fishing, fleet, of, local, inhabitants, of, a, coastal, community, will, not, simply, transfer, so, as, to, benefit, present, day, recreational, boat, owners, who, may, hail, from, much, further, afield, whereas, a, group, of, houseboats, on, a, mooring, that, has, been, in, continuous, use, for, the, last, 25, years, with, a, mixture, of, owner, occupiers, and, rented, houseboats, may, clearly, continue, to, be, used, by, houseboats, where, the, owners, live, in, the, same, town, or, city, both, the, purpose, of, the, moorings, and, the, class, of, persons, benefited, by, the, custom, must, have, been, clear, and, consistent, in, canada, customary, aboriginal, law, has, a, constitutional, foundation, and, for, this, reason, has, increasing, influence, in, the, scandinavian, countries, customary, law, continues, to, exist, and, has, great, influence, customary, law, is, also, used, in, some, developing, countries, usually, used, alongside, common, or, civil, law, for, example, in, ethiopia, despite, the, adoption, of, legal, codes, based, on, civil, law, in, the, 1950s, according, to, dolores, donovan, and, getachew, assefa, there, are, more, than, 60, systems, of, customary, law, currently, in, force, some, of, them, operating, quite, independently, of, the, formal, state, legal, system, they, offer, two, reasons, for, the, relative, autonomy, of, these, customary, law, systems, one, is, that, the, ethiopian, government, lacks, sufficient, resources, to, enforce, its, legal, system, to, every, corner, of, ethiopia, the, other, is, that, the, ethiopian, government, has, made, a, commitment, to, preserve, these, customary, systems, within, its, boundaries, in, 1995, president, of, kyrgyzstan, askar, akaev, announced, a, decree, to, revitalize, the, aqsaqal, courts, of, village, elders, the, courts, would, have, jurisdiction, over, property, torts, and, family, law, the, aqsaqal, courts, were, eventually, included, under, article, 92, of, the, kyrgyz, constitution, as, of, 2006, there, were, approximately, 1, 000, aqsaqal, courts, throughout, kyrgyzstan, including, in, the, capital, of, bishkek, akaev, linked, the, development, of, these, courts, to, the, rekindling, of, kyrgyz, national, identity, in, a, 2005, speech, he, connected, the, courts, back, to, the, country, s, nomadic, past, and, extolled, how, the, courts, expressed, the, kyrgyz, ability, of, self, governance, similar, aqsaqal, courts, exist, with, varying, levels, of, legal, formality, in, other, countries, of, central, asia, the, somali, people, in, the, horn, of, africa, follow, a, customary, law, system, referred, to, as, xeer, it, survives, to, a, significant, degree, everywhere, in, somalia, and, in, the, somali, communities, in, the, ogaden, economist, peter, leeson, attributes, the, increase, in, economic, activity, since, the, fall, of, the, siad, barre, administration, to, the, security, in, life, liberty, and, property, provided, by, xeer, in, large, parts, of, somalia, the, dutch, attorney, michael, van, notten, also, draws, upon, his, experience, as, a, legal, expert, in, his, comprehensive, study, on, xeer, the, law, of, the, somalis, a, stable, foundation, for, economic, development, in, the, horn, of, africa, 2005, in, india, many, customs, are, accepted, by, law, for, example, hindu, marriage, ceremonies, are, recognized, by, the, hindu, marriage, act, in, indonesia, customary, adat, laws, of, the, country, s, various, indigenous, ethnicities, are, recognized, and, customary, dispute, resolution, is, recognized, in, papua, indonesian, adat, law, are, mainly, divided, into, 19, circles, namely, aceh, gayo, alas, and, batak,

princely, states, custom, is, used, in, tort, law, to, help, determine, negligence, following, or, disregarding, a, custom, is, not, determinative, of, negligence, but, instead, is, an, indication, of, possible, best, practices, or, alternatives, to, a, particular, action
