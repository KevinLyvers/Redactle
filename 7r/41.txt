productivity, is, the, efficiency, of, production, of, goods, or, services, expressed, by, some, measure, measurements, of, productivity, are, often, expressed, as, a, ratio, of, an, aggregate, output, to, a, single, input, or, an, aggregate, input, used, in, a, production, process, i, e, output, per, unit, of, input, typically, over, a, specific, period, of, time, the, most, common, example, is, the, aggregate, labour, productivity, measure, one, example, of, which, is, gdp, per, worker, there, are, many, different, definitions, of, productivity, including, those, that, are, not, defined, as, ratios, of, output, to, input, and, the, choice, among, them, depends, on, the, purpose, of, the, productivity, measurement, and, data, availability, the, key, source, of, difference, between, various, productivity, measures, is, also, usually, related, directly, or, indirectly, to, how, the, outputs, and, the, inputs, are, aggregated, to, obtain, such, a, ratio, type, measure, of, productivity, productivity, is, a, crucial, factor, in, the, production, performance, of, firms, and, nations, increasing, national, productivity, can, raise, living, standards, because, increase, in, income, per, capita, improves, people, s, ability, to, purchase, goods, and, services, enjoy, leisure, improve, housing, and, education, and, contribute, to, social, and, environmental, programs, productivity, growth, can, also, help, businesses, to, be, more, profitable, productivity, measures, that, use, one, class, of, inputs, or, factors, but, not, multiple, factors, are, called, partial, productivities, in, practice, measurement, in, production, means, measures, of, partial, productivity, interpreted, correctly, these, components, are, indicative, of, productivity, development, and, approximate, the, efficiency, with, which, inputs, are, used, in, an, economy, to, produce, goods, and, services, however, productivity, is, only, measured, partially, or, approximately, in, a, way, the, measurements, are, defective, because, they, do, not, measure, everything, but, it, is, possible, to, interpret, correctly, the, results, of, partial, productivity, and, to, benefit, from, them, in, practical, situations, at, the, company, level, typical, partial, productivity, measures, are, such, things, as, worker, hours, materials, or, energy, used, per, unit, of, production, before, the, widespread, use, of, computer, networks, partial, productivity, was, tracked, in, tabular, form, and, with, hand, drawn, graphs, tabulating, machines, for, data, processing, began, being, widely, used, in, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, and, remained, in, use, until, mainframe, computers, became, widespread, in, the, late, 1960s, through, the, 1970s, by, the, late, 1970s, inexpensive, computers, allowed, industrial, operations, to, perform, process, control, and, track, productivity, today, data, collection, is, largely, computerized, and, almost, any, variable, can, be, viewed, graphically, in, real, time, or, retrieved, for, selected, time, periods, in, macroeconomics, a, common, partial, productivity, measure, is, labour, productivity, labour, productivity, is, a, revealing, indicator, of, several, economic, indicators, as, it, offers, a, dynamic, measure, of, economic, growth, competitiveness, and, living, standards, within, an, economy, it, is, the, measure, of, labour, productivity, and, all, that, this, measure, takes, into, account, which, helps, explain, the, principal, economic, foundations, that, are, necessary, for, both, economic, growth, and, social, development, in, general, labour, productivity, is, equal, to, the, ratio, between, a, measure, of, output, volume, gross, domestic, product, or, gross, value, added, and, a, measure, of, input, use, the, total, number, of, hours, worked, or, total, employment, the, output, measure, is, typically, net, output, more, specifically, the, value, added, by, the, process, under, consideration, i, e, the, value, of, outputs, minus, the, value, of, intermediate, inputs, this, is, done, in, order, to, avoid, double, counting, when, an, output, of, one, firm, is, used, as, an, input, by, another, in, the, same, measurement, in, macroeconomics, the, most, well, known, and, used, measure, of, value, added, is, the, gross, domestic, product, or, gdp, increases, in, it, are, widely, used, as, a, measure, of, the, economic, growth, of, nations, and, industries, gdp, is, the, income, available, for, paying, capital, costs, labor, compensation, taxes, and, profits, some, economists, instead, use, gross, value, added, gva, there, is, normally, a, strong, correlation, between, gdp, and, gva, the, measure, of, input, use, reflects, the, time, effort, and, skills, of, the, workforce, the, denominator, of, the, ratio, of, labour, productivity, the, input, measure, is, the, most, important, factor, that, influences, the, measure, of, labour, productivity, labour, input, is, measured, either, by, the, total, number, of, hours, worked, of, all, persons, employed, or, total, employment, head, count, there, are, both, advantages, and, disadvantages, associated, with, the, different, input, measures, that, are, used, in, the, calculation, of, labour, productivity, it, is, generally, accepted, that, the, total, number, of, hours, worked, is, the, most, appropriate, measure, of, labour, input, because, a, simple, headcount, of, employed, persons, can, hide, changes, in, average, hours, worked, and, has, difficulties, accounting, for, variations, in, work, such, as, a, part, time, contract, paid, leave, overtime, or, shifts, in, normal, hours, however, the, quality, of, hours, worked, estimates, is, not, always, clear, in, particular, statistical, establishment, and, household, surveys, are, difficult, to, use, because, of, their, varying, quality, of, hours, worked, estimates, and, their, varying, degree, of, international, comparability, gdp, per, capita, is, a, rough, measure, of, average, living, standards, or, economic, well, being, and, is, one, of, the, core, indicators, of, economic, performance, gdp, is, for, this, purpose, only, a, very, rough, measure, maximizing, gdp, in, principle, also, allows, maximizing, capital, usage, for, this, reason, gdp, is, systematically, biased, in, favour, of, capital, intensive, production, at, the, expense, of, knowledge, and, labour, intensive, production, the, use, of, capital, in, the, gdp, measure, is, considered, to, be, as, valuable, as, the, production, s, ability, to, pay, taxes, profits, and, labor, compensation, the, bias, of, the, gdp, is, actually, the, difference, between, the, gdp, and, the, producer, income, another, labour, productivity, measure, output, per, worker, is, often, seen, as, a, proper, measure, of, labour, productivity, as, here, productivity, isn, t, everything, but, in, the, long, run, it, is, almost, everything, a, country, s, ability, to, improve, its, standard, of, living, over, time, depends, almost, entirely, on, its, ability, to, raise, its, output, per, worker, this, measure, output, per, worker, is, however, more, problematic, than, the, gdp, or, even, invalid, because, this, measure, allows, maximizing, all, supplied, inputs, i, e, materials, services, energy, and, capital, at, the, expense, of, producer, income, when, multiple, inputs, are, considered, the, measure, is, called, multi, factor, productivity, or, mfp, multi, factor, productivity, is, typically, estimated, using, growth, accounting, if, the, inputs, specifically, are, labor, and, capital, and, the, outputs, are, value, added, intermediate, outputs, the, measure, is, called, total, factor, productivity, tfp, tfp, measures, the, residual, growth, that, cannot, be, explained, by, the, rate, of, change, in, the, services, of, labour, and, capital, mfp, replaced, the, term, tfp, used, in, the, earlier, literature, and, both, terms, continue, in, use, usually, interchangeably, tfp, is, often, interpreted, as, a, rough, average, measure, of, productivity, more, specifically, the, contribution, to, economic, growth, made, by, factors, such, as, technical, and, organisational, innovation, the, most, famous, description, is, that, of, robert, solow, s, 1957, i, am, using, the, phrase, technical, change, as, a, shorthand, expression, for, any, kind, of, shift, in, the, production, function, thus, slowdowns, speed, ups, improvements, in, the, education, of, the, labor, force, and, all, sorts, of, things, will, appear, as, technical, change, the, original, mfp, model, involves, several, assumptions, that, there, is, a, stable, functional, relation, between, inputs, and, output, at, the, economy, wide, level, of, aggregation, that, this, function, has, neoclassical, smoothness, and, curvature, properties, that, inputs, are, paid, the, value, of, their, marginal, product, that, the, function, exhibits, constant, returns, to, scale, and, that, technical, change, has, the, hicks, n, neutral, form, in, practice, tfp, is, a, measure, of, our, ignorance, as, abramovitz, 1956, put, it, precisely, because, it, is, a, residual, this, ignorance, covers, many, components, some, wanted, like, the, effects, of, technical, and, organizational, innovation, others, unwanted, measurement, error, omitted, variables, aggregation, bias, model, misspecification, hence, the, relationship, between, tfp, and, productivity, remains, unclear, when, all, outputs, and, inputs, are, included, in, the, productivity, measure, it, is, called, total, productivity, a, valid, measurement, of, total, productivity, necessitates, considering, all, production, inputs, if, we, omit, an, input, in, productivity, or, income, accounting, this, means, that, the, omitted, input, can, be, used, unlimitedly, in, production, without, any, impact, on, accounting, results, because, total, productivity, includes, all, production, inputs, it, is, used, as, an, integrated, variable, when, we, want, to, explain, income, formation, of, the, production, process, davis, has, considered, the, phenomenon, of, productivity, measurement, of, productivity, distribution, of, productivity, gains, and, how, to, measure, such, gains, he, refers, to, an, article, suggesting, that, the, measurement, of, productivity, shall, be, developed, so, that, it, will, indicate, increases, or, decreases, in, the, productivity, of, the, company, and, also, the, distribution, of, the, fruits, of, production, among, all, parties, at, interest, according, to, davis, the, price, system, is, a, mechanism, through, which, productivity, gains, are, distributed, and, besides, the, business, enterprise, receiving, parties, may, consist, of, its, customers, staff, and, the, suppliers, of, production, inputs, in, the, main, article, is, presented, the, role, of, total, productivity, as, a, variable, when, explaining, how, income, formation, of, production, is, always, a, balance, between, income, generation, and, income, distribution, the, income, change, created, by, production, function, is, always, distributed, to, the, stakeholders, as, economic, values, within, the, review, period, productivity, growth, is, a, crucial, source, of, growth, in, living, standards, productivity, growth, means, more, value, is, added, in, production, and, this, means, more, income, is, available, to, be, distributed, at, a, firm, or, industry, level, the, benefits, of, productivity, growth, can, be, distributed, in, a, number, of, different, ways, productivity, growth, is, important, to, the, firm, because, it, means, that, it, can, meet, its, perhaps, growing, obligations, to, workers, shareholders, and, governments, taxes, and, regulation, and, still, remain, competitive, or, even, improve, its, competitiveness, in, the, market, place, adding, more, inputs, will, not, increase, the, income, earned, per, unit, of, input, unless, there, are, increasing, returns, to, scale, in, fact, it, is, likely, to, mean, lower, average, wages, and, lower, rates, of, profit, but, when, there, is, productivity, growth, even, the, existing, commitment, of, resources, generates, more, output, and, income, income, generated, per, unit, of, input, increases, additional, resources, are, also, attracted, into, production, and, can, be, profitably, employed, in, the, most, immediate, sense, productivity, is, determined, by, the, available, technology, or, know, how, for, converting, resources, into, outputs, and, the, way, in, which, resources, are, organized, to, produce, goods, and, services, historically, productivity, has, improved, through, evolution, as, processes, with, poor, productivity, performance, are, abandoned, and, newer, forms, are, exploited, process, improvements, may, include, organizational, structures, e, g, core, functions, and, supplier, relationships, management, systems, work, arrangements, manufacturing, techniques, and, changing, market, structure, a, famous, example, is, the, assembly, line, and, the, process, of, mass, production, that, appeared, in, the, decade, following, commercial, introduction, of, the, automobile, mass, production, dramatically, reduced, the, labor, in, producing, parts, for, and, assembling, the, automobile, but, after, its, widespread, adoption, productivity, gains, in, automobile, production, were, much, lower, a, similar, pattern, was, observed, with, electrification, which, saw, the, highest, productivity, gains, in, the, early, decades, after, introduction, many, other, industries, show, similar, patterns, the, pattern, was, again, followed, by, the, computer, information, and, communications, industries, in, the, late, 1990s, when, much, of, the, national, productivity, gains, occurred, in, these, industries, there, is, a, general, understanding, of, the, main, determinants, or, drivers, of, productivity, growth, certain, factors, are, critical, for, determining, productivity, growth, the, office, for, national, statistics, uk, identifies, five, drivers, that, interact, to, underlie, long, term, productivity, performance, investment, innovation, skills, enterprise, and, competition, research, and, development, r, d, tends, to, increase, productivity, growth, with, public, r, d, showing, larger, spillovers, and, smaller, firms, experiencing, larger, productivity, gains, from, public, r, d, technology, has, enabled, massive, personal, productivity, gains, computers, spreadsheets, email, and, other, advances, have, made, it, possible, for, a, knowledge, worker, to, seemingly, produce, more, in, a, day, than, was, previously, possible, in, a, year, environmental, factors, such, as, sleep, and, leisure, play, a, significant, role, in, work, productivity, and, received, wage, drivers, of, productivity, growth, for, creative, and, knowledge, workers, include, improved, or, intensified, exchange, with, peers, or, co, workers, as, more, productive, peers, have, a, stimulating, effect, on, one, s, own, productivity, productivity, is, influenced, by, effective, supervision, and, job, satisfaction, an, effective, or, knowledgeable, supervisor, for, example, a, supervisor, who, uses, the, management, by, objectives, method, has, an, easier, time, motivating, their, employees, to, produce, more, in, quantity, and, quality, an, employee, who, has, an, effective, supervisor, motivating, them, to, be, more, productive, is, likely, to, experience, a, new, level, of, job, satisfaction, thereby, becoming, a, driver, of, productivity, itself, there, is, also, considerable, evidence, to, support, improved, productivity, through, operant, conditioning, reinforcement, successful, gamification, engagement, and, research, based, recommendations, on, principles, and, implementation, guidelines, for, using, monetary, rewards, effectively, workplace, bullying, results, in, a, loss, of, productivity, as, measured, by, self, rated, job, performance, over, time, targets, of, bullying, will, spend, more, time, protecting, themselves, against, harassment, by, bullies, and, less, time, fulfilling, their, duties, workplace, incivility, has, also, been, associated, with, diminished, productivity, in, terms, of, quality, and, quantity, of, work, a, toxic, workplace, is, a, workplace, that, is, marked, by, significant, drama, and, infighting, where, personal, battles, often, harm, productivity, while, employees, are, distracted, by, this, they, cannot, devote, time, and, attention, to, the, achievement, of, business, goals, when, toxic, employees, leave, the, workplace, it, can, improve, the, culture, overall, because, the, remaining, staff, become, more, engaged, and, productive, the, presence, of, a, workplace, psychopath, may, have, a, serious, detrimental, impact, on, productivity, in, an, organisation, in, companies, where, the, traditional, hierarchy, has, been, removed, in, favor, of, an, egalitarian, team, based, setup, the, employees, are, often, happier, and, individual, productivity, is, improved, as, they, themselves, are, better, placed, to, increase, the, efficiency, of, the, workfloor, companies, that, have, these, hierarchies, removed, and, have, their, employees, work, more, in, teams, are, called, liberated, companies, or, freedom, inc, s, the, kaizen, system, of, bottom, up, continuous, improvement, was, first, practiced, by, japanese, manufacturers, after, world, war, ii, most, notably, as, part, of, the, toyota, way, productivity, is, one, of, the, main, concerns, of, business, management, and, engineering, many, companies, have, formal, programs, for, continuously, improving, productivity, such, as, a, production, assurance, program, whether, they, have, a, formal, program, or, not, companies, are, constantly, looking, for, ways, to, improve, quality, reduce, downtime, and, inputs, of, labor, materials, energy, and, purchased, services, often, simple, changes, to, operating, methods, or, processes, increase, productivity, but, the, biggest, gains, are, normally, from, adopting, new, technologies, which, may, require, capital, expenditures, for, new, equipment, computers, or, software, modern, productivity, science, owes, much, to, formal, investigations, that, are, associated, with, scientific, management, although, from, an, individual, management, perspective, employees, may, be, doing, their, jobs, well, and, with, high, levels, of, individual, productivity, from, an, organizational, perspective, their, productivity, may, in, fact, be, zero, or, effectively, negative, if, they, are, dedicated, to, redundant, or, value, destroying, activities, in, office, buildings, and, service, centred, companies, productivity, is, largely, influenced, and, affected, by, operational, byproducts, meetings, the, past, few, years, have, seen, a, positive, uptick, in, the, number, of, software, solutions, focused, on, improving, office, productivity, in, truth, proper, planning, and, procedures, are, more, likely, to, help, than, anything, else, overall, productivity, growth, was, relatively, slow, from, the, 1970s, through, the, early, 1990s, and, again, from, the, 2000s, to, 2020s, although, several, possible, causes, for, the, slowdown, have, been, proposed, there, is, no, consensus, the, matter, is, subject, to, a, continuing, debate, that, has, grown, beyond, questioning, whether, just, computers, can, significantly, increase, productivity, to, whether, the, potential, to, increase, productivity, is, becoming, exhausted, in, order, to, measure, the, productivity, of, a, nation, or, an, industry, it, is, necessary, to, operationalize, the, same, concept, of, productivity, as, in, a, production, unit, or, a, company, yet, the, object, of, modelling, is, substantially, wider, and, the, information, more, aggregate, the, calculations, of, productivity, of, a, nation, or, an, industry, are, based, on, the, time, series, of, the, sna, system, of, national, accounts, national, accounting, is, a, system, based, on, the, recommendations, of, the, un, sna, 93, to, measure, the, total, production, and, total, income, of, a, nation, and, how, they, are, used, international, or, national, productivity, growth, stems, from, a, complex, interaction, of, factors, some, of, the, most, important, immediate, factors, include, technological, change, organizational, change, industry, restructuring, and, resource, reallocation, as, well, as, economies, of, scale, and, scope, a, nation, s, average, productivity, level, can, also, be, affected, by, the, movement, of, resources, from, low, productivity, to, high, productivity, industries, and, activities, over, time, other, factors, such, as, research, and, development, and, innovative, effort, the, development, of, human, capital, through, education, and, incentives, from, stronger, competition, promote, the, search, for, productivity, improvements, and, the, ability, to, achieve, them, ultimately, many, policy, institutional, and, cultural, factors, determine, a, nation, s, success, in, improving, productivity, at, the, national, level, productivity, growth, raises, living, standards, because, more, real, income, improves, people, s, ability, to, purchase, goods, and, services, whether, they, are, necessities, or, luxuries, enjoy, leisure, improve, housing, and, education, and, contribute, to, social, and, environmental, programs, some, have, suggested, that, the, uk, s, productivity, puzzle, is, an, urgent, issue, for, policy, makers, and, businesses, to, address, in, order, to, sustain, growth, over, long, periods, of, time, small, differences, in, rates, of, productivity, growth, compound, like, interest, in, a, bank, account, and, can, make, an, enormous, difference, to, a, society, s, prosperity, nothing, contributes, more, to, reduction, of, poverty, to, increases, in, leisure, and, to, the, country, s, ability, to, finance, education, public, health, environment, and, the, arts, productivity, is, considered, basic, statistical, information, for, many, international, comparisons, and, country, performance, assessments, and, there, is, strong, interest, in, comparing, them, internationally, the, oecd, publishes, an, annual, compendium, of, productivity, indicators, that, includes, both, labor, and, multi, factor, measures, of, productivity
