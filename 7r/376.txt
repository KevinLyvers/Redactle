irian, jaya, w, to, e, png, highlands, w, to, e, southern, png, e, to, w, trans, new, guinea, tng, is, an, extensive, family, of, papuan, languages, spoken, on, the, island, of, new, guinea, and, neighboring, islands, a, region, corresponding, to, the, country, papua, new, guinea, as, well, as, parts, of, indonesia, trans, new, guinea, is, perhaps, the, third, largest, language, family, in, the, world, by, number, of, languages, the, core, of, the, family, is, considered, to, be, established, but, its, boundaries, and, overall, membership, are, uncertain, the, languages, are, spoken, by, around, 3, million, people, there, have, been, several, main, proposals, as, to, its, internal, classification, although, papuan, languages, for, the, most, part, are, poorly, documented, several, of, the, branches, of, trans, new, guinea, have, been, recognized, for, some, time, the, eleman, languages, were, first, proposed, by, s, ray, in, 1907, parts, of, marind, were, recognized, by, ray, and, jhp, murray, in, 1918, and, the, rai, coast, languages, in, 1919, again, by, ray, the, precursor, of, the, trans, new, guinea, family, was, stephen, wurm, s, 1960, proposal, of, an, east, new, guinea, highlands, family, although, broken, up, by, malcolm, ross, in, 2005, it, united, different, branches, of, what, became, tng, for, the, first, time, linking, engan, chimbu, wahgi, goroka, and, kainantu, duna, and, kalam, were, added, in, 1971, then, in, 1970, clemens, voorhoeve, and, kenneth, mcelhanon, noted, 91, lexical, resemblances, between, the, central, and, south, new, guinea, csng, and, finisterre, huon, families, which, they, had, respectively, established, a, few, years, earlier, although, they, did, not, work, out, regular, sound, correspondences, and, so, could, not, distinguish, between, cognates, due, to, genealogical, relationship, cognates, due, to, borrowing, and, chance, resemblances, their, research, was, taken, seriously, they, chose, the, name, trans, new, guinea, because, this, new, family, was, the, first, to, span, new, guinea, from, the, bomberai, peninsula, of, western, west, irian, to, the, huon, peninsula, of, eastern, png, they, also, noted, possible, cognates, in, other, families, wurm, would, later, add, to, tng, wurm, s, east, new, guinea, highlands, binandere, in, the, bird, s, tail, of, png, and, two, families, that, john, z, graggen, would, later, 1971, 1975, unite, in, his, 100, language, madang, adelbert, range, family, in, 1975, wurm, accepted, voorhoeve, and, mcelhanon, s, suspicions, about, further, connections, as, well, as, z, graggen, s, work, and, postulated, additional, links, to, among, others, the, languages, of, the, island, of, timor, to, the, west, of, new, guinea, angan, goilalan, koiarian, dagan, eleman, wissel, lakes, the, erstwhile, dani, kwerba, family, and, the, erstwhile, trans, fly, bulaka, river, family, which, he, had, established, in, 1970, expanding, tng, into, an, enormous, language, phylum, that, covered, most, of, the, island, of, new, guinea, as, well, as, timor, and, neighboring, islands, and, included, over, 500, languages, spoken, by, some, 2, 300, 000, people, however, part, of, the, evidence, for, this, was, typological, and, wurm, stated, that, he, did, not, expect, it, to, stand, up, well, to, scrutiny, although, he, based, the, phylum, on, characteristic, personal, pronouns, several, of, the, branches, had, no, pronouns, in, common, with, the, rest, of, the, family, or, even, had, pronouns, related, to, non, tng, families, but, were, included, because, they, were, grammatically, similar, to, tng, other, families, that, had, typical, tng, pronouns, were, excluded, because, they, did, not, resemble, other, tng, families, in, their, grammatical, structure, because, grammatical, typology, is, readily, borrowed, many, of, the, austronesian, languages, in, new, guinea, have, grammatical, structures, similar, to, their, papuan, neighbors, for, example, and, conversely, many, papuan, languages, resemble, typical, austronesian, languages, typologically, other, linguists, were, skeptical, william, a, foley, rejected, wurm, s, and, even, some, of, voorhoeve, s, results, and, he, broke, much, of, tng, into, its, constituent, parts, several, dozen, small, but, clearly, valid, families, plus, a, number, of, apparent, isolates, in, 2005, malcolm, ross, published, a, draft, proposal, re, evaluating, trans, new, guinea, and, found, what, he, believed, to, be, overwhelming, evidence, for, a, reduced, version, of, the, phylum, based, solely, on, lexical, resemblances, which, retained, as, much, as, 85, of, wurm, s, hypothesis, though, some, of, it, tentatively, the, strongest, lexical, evidence, for, any, language, family, is, shared, morphological, paradigms, especially, highly, irregular, or, suppletive, paradigms, with, bound, morphology, because, these, are, extremely, resistant, to, borrowing, for, example, the, fact, that, german, words, gut, good, and, besser, better, resemble, their, english, counterparts, would, be, stronger, evidence, that, german, is, related, to, english, than, the, mere, lexical, correspondence, between, german, rot, and, english, red, for, the, color, however, because, of, the, great, morphological, complexity, of, many, papuan, languages, and, the, poor, state, of, documentation, of, nearly, all, in, new, guinea, this, approach, is, essentially, restricted, to, comparing, pronouns, ross, reconstructed, pronouns, sets, for, foley, s, basic, families, and, compared, these, reconstructions, rather, than, using, a, direct, mass, comparison, of, all, papuan, languages, attempted, to, then, reconstruct, the, ancestral, pronouns, of, the, proto, trans, new, guinea, language, such, as, ni, we, gi, you, i, they, and, then, compared, poorly, supported, branches, directly, to, this, reconstruction, families, required, two, apparent, cognates, to, be, included, however, if, any, language, in, a, family, was, a, match, the, family, was, considered, a, match, greatly, increasing, the, likelihood, of, coincidental, resemblances, and, because, the, plural, forms, are, related, to, the, singular, forms, a, match, of, 1sg, and, 1pl, although, satisfying, ross, s, requirement, of, two, matches, is, not, actually, two, independent, matches, again, increasing, the, likelihood, of, spurious, matches, in, addition, ross, counted, forms, like, a, as, a, match, to, 2sg, ga, so, that, v, kv, v, v, all, counted, as, matches, to, ga, and, although, n, and, occur, in, papuan, pronouns, at, twice, the, level, expected, by, their, occurrence, in, pronouns, elsewhere, in, the, world, they, do, not, correlate, with, each, other, as, they, would, if, they, reflected, a, language, family, that, is, it, is, argued, that, ross, s, pronouns, do, not, support, the, validity, of, trans, new, guinea, and, do, not, reveal, which, families, might, belong, to, it, ross, also, included, in, his, proposal, several, better, attested, families, for, non, pronominal, evidence, despite, a, lack, of, pronouns, common, to, other, branches, of, tng, and, he, suggested, that, there, may, be, other, families, that, would, have, been, included, if, they, had, been, better, attested, several, additional, families, are, only, tentatively, linked, to, tng, because, the, boundaries, of, ross, s, proposal, are, based, primarily, on, a, single, parameter, the, pronouns, all, internal, structure, remains, tentative, most, tng, languages, are, spoken, by, only, a, few, thousand, people, with, only, seven, melpa, kuman, enga, huli, western, dani, makasae, and, ekari, being, spoken, by, more, than, 100, 000, the, most, populous, language, outside, of, mainland, new, guinea, is, makasae, of, east, timor, with, 100, 000, speakers, throughout, the, eastern, part, of, the, country, enga, is, the, most, populous, trans, new, guinea, language, spoken, in, new, guinea, with, more, than, 200, 000, speakers, golin, sinasina, mid, grand, valley, dani, kamano, and, bunaq, have, between, 50, 000, and, 100, 000, speakers, galela, of, halmahera, usually, not, classified, as, trans, new, guinea, also, has, between, 50, 000, and, 100, 000, speakers, all, other, trans, new, guinea, languages, have, fewer, than, 50, 000, speakers, the, greatest, linguistic, diversity, in, ross, s, trans, new, guinea, proposal, and, therefore, perhaps, the, location, of, the, proto, trans, new, guinea, homeland, is, in, the, interior, highlands, of, papua, new, guinea, in, the, central, to, eastern, new, guinea, cordillera, where, wurm, first, posited, his, east, new, guinea, highlands, family, indonesian, papua, and, the, papuan, peninsula, of, papua, new, guinea, the, bird, s, tail, have, fewer, and, more, widely, extended, branches, of, tng, and, were, therefore, likely, settled, by, tng, speakers, after, the, proto, language, broke, up, ross, speculates, that, the, tng, family, may, have, spread, with, the, high, population, densities, that, resulted, from, the, domestication, of, taro, settling, quickly, in, the, highland, valleys, along, the, length, of, the, cordillera, but, spreading, much, more, slowly, into, the, malarial, lowlands, and, not, at, all, into, areas, such, as, the, sepik, river, valley, where, the, people, already, had, yam, agriculture, which, thus, supported, high, population, densities, ross, suggests, that, tng, may, have, arrived, at, its, western, limit, the, islands, near, timor, perhaps, four, to, 4, 5, thousand, years, ago, before, the, expansion, of, austronesian, into, this, area, roger, blench, associates, the, spread, of, trans, new, guinea, languages, with, the, domestication, of, the, banana, wurm, et, al, identify, the, subdivisions, in, their, papuan, classification, as, families, on, the, order, of, relatedness, of, the, germanic, languages, stocks, on, the, order, of, the, indo, european, languages, and, phyla, on, the, order, of, the, nostratic, hypothesis, trans, new, guinea, is, a, phylum, in, this, terminology, a, language, that, is, not, related, to, any, other, at, a, family, level, or, below, is, called, an, isolate, in, this, scheme, family, level, groups, are, listed, in, boldface, as, of, 2003, william, a, foley, accepted, the, core, of, tng, the, fact, for, example, that, a, great, swath, of, languages, in, new, guinea, from, the, huon, peninsula, to, the, highlands, of, irian, jaya, mark, the, object, of, a, transitive, verb, with, a, set, of, verbal, prefixes, a, first, person, singular, in, n, and, second, person, singular, in, a, velar, stop, is, overwhelming, evidence, that, these, languages, are, all, genetically, related, the, likelihood, of, such, a, system, being, borrowed, vanishingly, small, he, considered, the, relationship, between, the, finisterre, huon, eastern, highlands, kainantu, gorokan, and, irian, highlands, dani, paniai, lakes, families, and, presumably, some, other, smaller, ones, to, be, established, and, he, said, that, it, is, highly, likely, that, the, madang, family, belongs, as, well, he, considered, it, possible, but, not, yet, demonstrated, that, the, enga, chimbu, binandere, angan, ok, awyu, asmat, perhaps, closest, to, ok, and, awyu, mek, sentani, and, the, seven, small, language, families, of, the, tail, of, papua, new, guinea, koiarian, goilalan, etc, which, he, maintains, have, not, been, shown, to, be, closely, related, to, each, other, may, belong, to, tng, as, well, ross, does, not, use, specialized, terms, for, different, levels, of, classification, as, donald, laycock, and, stephen, wurm, did, in, the, list, given, here, the, uncontroversial, families, that, are, accepted, by, foley, and, other, papuanists, and, that, are, the, building, blocks, of, ross, s, tng, are, printed, in, boldface, language, isolates, are, printed, in, italics, ross, removed, about, 100, languages, from, wurm, s, proposal, and, only, tentatively, retained, a, few, dozen, more, but, in, one, instance, he, added, a, language, the, isolate, porome, ross, did, not, have, sufficient, evidence, to, classify, all, papuan, groups, in, addition, the, classification, is, based, on, a, single, feature, shared, pronouns, especially, 1sg, and, 2sg, and, thus, is, subject, to, false, positives, as, well, as, to, missing, branches, that, have, undergone, significant, sound, changes, since, he, does, not, have, the, data, to, establish, regular, sound, correspondences, although, ross, based, his, classification, on, pronoun, systems, many, languages, in, new, guinea, are, too, poorly, documented, for, even, this, to, work, thus, there, are, several, isolates, that, were, placed, in, tng, by, wurm, but, that, cannot, be, addressed, by, ross, s, classification, a, few, of, them, komyandaret, samarokena, and, maybe, kenati, have, since, been, assigned, to, existing, branches, or, ex, branches, of, tng, whereas, others, massep, momuna, continue, to, defy, classification, ross, removed, 95, languages, from, tng, these, are, small, families, with, no, pronouns, in, common, with, tng, languages, but, that, are, typologically, similar, perhaps, due, to, long, periods, of, contact, with, tng, languages, andrew, pawley, and, harald, hammarstr, m, 2018, accept, 35, subgroups, as, members, of, trans, new, guinea, groups, and, isolates, considered, by, pawley, and, hammarstr, m, 2018, as, having, weaker, or, disputed, claims, to, membership, in, trans, new, guinea, some, of, which, they, suggest, may, ultimately, turn, out, to, be, trans, new, guinea, but, further, evidence, is, needed, groups, and, isolates, sometimes, classified, as, trans, new, guinea, but, rejected, by, pawley, and, hammarstr, m, 2018, as, trans, new, guinea, glottolog, of, which, hammarstr, m, is, one, of, the, editors, accepts, 10, groups, as, part, of, a, nuclear, trans, new, guinea, family, based, on, foley, 2000, pawley, 2005, and, edgar, suter, 1997, matthew, dryer, used, lexicostatistics, to, evaluate, pawley, and, hammarstr, m, 2018, based, on, 40, word, swadesh, list, data, from, the, asjp, database, dryer, concludes, that, the, following, language, families, are, likely, to, be, trans, new, guinea, they, are, listed, in, order, of, highest, to, lowest, score, i, e, starting, with, the, most, likely, dryer, does, not, consider, that, evidence, based, solely, on, pronouns, and, the, word, for, louse, is, sufficient, to, conclude, that, a, family, is, a, member, of, trans, new, guinea, this, is, because, they, are, more, likely, to, be, an, areal, form, wanderwort, in, the, case, of, the, word, for, louse, or, to, be, highly, conservative, in, the, case, of, pronouns, dryer, states, that, similarities, solely, in, pronouns, mean, that, the, families, are, related, but, that, the, relationship, is, so, distant, as, to, be, undetectable, dryer, notes, that, this, is, a, preliminary, quantitative, analysis, and, only, gives, a, rough, prediction, of, the, families, that, may, or, may, not, belong, within, trans, new, guinea, and, that, the, lexical, similarities, it, is, based, on, may, be, due, to, loanwords, areal, forms, wanderw, rter, and, so, forth, pawley, and, hammarstr, m, 2018, do, not, classify, bayono, awbono, and, damal, as, trans, new, guinea, dryer, lists, the, following, families, as, borderline, they, have, a, somewhat, higher, basic, lexical, similarity, with, trans, new, guinea, than, with, non, trans, new, guinea, families, pawley, and, hammarstr, m, 2018, do, not, classify, south, bird, s, head, timor, alor, pantar, or, teberan, as, trans, new, guinea, dryer, lists, the, following, families, as, less, likely, to, be, trans, new, guinea, they, have, few, basic, vocabulary, items, in, common, with, trans, new, guinea, timothy, usher, and, edgar, suter, in, consultation, with, papuan, language, researchers, such, as, william, croft, matthew, dryer, john, lynch, andrew, pawley, and, malcolm, ross, have, reconstructed, low, level, constituents, of, trans, new, guinea, to, verify, through, the, establishment, of, regular, sound, changes, which, purported, members, truly, belong, to, it, and, to, determine, their, subclassification, in, many, cases, usher, has, created, new, names, for, the, member, families, to, reflect, their, geographic, location, much, of, usher, s, classification, is, accepted, by, glottolog, though, under, different, names, as, of, 2024, his, classification, is, as, follows, including, correspondences, to, the, names, in, earlier, classifications, he, expects, to, expand, the, membership, of, the, family, as, reconstruction, proceeds, these, branches, may, cluster, together, the, southwestern, branches, for, example, may, group, together, but, the, details, are, as, yet, unclear, the, families, from, the, ross, and, glottolog, classifications, that, are, not, included, are, kaure, pauwasi, engan, chimbu, wahgi, madang, eleman, kiwaian, binanderean, goilalan, and, the, several, papuan, gulf, families, usher, only, includes, families, that, have, a, regular, reflex, of, the, 2sg, pronoun, so, there, may, be, additional, tng, families, that, have, changed, their, pronouns, a, number, of, colexification, patterns, called, semantic, conflations, by, donald, laycock, particularly, in, the, nominal, domain, are, commonly, found, among, trans, new, guinea, languages
