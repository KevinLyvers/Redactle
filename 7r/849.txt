the, working, class, is, a, subset, of, employees, who, are, compensated, with, wage, or, salary, based, contracts, whose, exact, membership, varies, from, definition, to, definition, members, of, the, working, class, rely, primarily, upon, earnings, from, wage, labour, most, common, definitions, of, working, class, in, use, in, the, united, states, limit, its, membership, to, workers, who, hold, blue, collar, and, pink, collar, jobs, whose, income, is, insufficiently, high, to, place, them, in, the, middle, class, or, both, however, socialists, define, working, class, to, include, all, workers, who, fall, into, this, category, thus, this, definition, can, include, almost, all, of, the, working, population, of, industrialized, economies, as, with, many, terms, describing, social, class, working, class, is, defined, and, used, in, many, different, ways, one, definition, used, by, many, socialists, is, that, the, working, class, includes, all, those, who, have, nothing, to, sell, but, their, labour, these, people, used, to, be, referred, to, as, the, proletariat, in, that, sense, the, working, class, today, includes, both, white, and, blue, collar, workers, manual, and, menial, workers, of, all, types, excluding, only, individuals, who, derive, their, livelihood, from, business, ownership, and, the, labour, of, others, the, term, which, is, primarily, used, to, evoke, images, of, laborers, suffering, class, disadvantage, in, spite, of, their, individual, effort, can, also, have, racial, connotations, these, racial, connotations, imply, diverse, themes, of, poverty, that, imply, whether, one, is, deserving, of, aid, when, used, in, non, socialist, contexts, however, it, often, refers, to, a, section, of, society, dependent, on, physical, labour, especially, when, compensated, with, an, hourly, wage, for, certain, types, of, science, as, well, as, journalistic, or, political, analysis, for, example, the, working, class, is, loosely, defined, as, those, without, college, degrees, working, class, occupations, are, then, categorized, into, four, groups, unskilled, labourers, artisans, outworkers, and, factory, workers, a, common, alternative, is, to, define, class, by, income, levels, when, this, approach, is, used, the, working, class, can, be, contrasted, with, a, so, called, middle, class, on, the, basis, of, differential, terms, of, access, to, economic, resources, education, cultural, interests, and, other, goods, and, services, the, cut, off, between, working, class, and, middle, class, here, might, mean, the, line, where, a, population, has, discretionary, income, rather, than, finances, for, basic, needs, and, essentials, for, example, on, fashion, versus, merely, nutrition, and, shelter, some, researchers, have, suggested, that, working, class, status, should, be, defined, subjectively, as, self, identification, with, the, working, class, group, this, subjective, approach, allows, people, rather, than, researchers, to, define, their, own, subjective, and, perceived, social, class, in, feudal, europe, the, working, class, as, such, did, not, exist, in, large, numbers, instead, most, people, were, part, of, the, labouring, class, a, group, made, up, of, different, professions, trades, and, occupations, a, lawyer, craftsman, and, peasant, were, all, considered, to, be, part, of, the, same, social, unit, a, third, estate, of, people, who, were, neither, aristocrats, nor, church, officials, similar, hierarchies, existed, outside, europe, in, other, pre, industrial, societies, the, social, position, of, these, labouring, classes, was, viewed, as, ordained, by, natural, law, and, common, religious, belief, this, social, position, was, contested, particularly, by, peasants, for, example, during, the, german, peasants, war, in, the, late, 18th, century, under, the, influence, of, the, enlightenment, european, society, was, in, a, state, of, change, and, this, change, could, not, be, reconciled, with, the, idea, of, a, changeless, god, created, social, order, wealthy, members, of, these, societies, created, ideologies, which, blamed, many, of, the, problems, of, working, class, people, on, their, morals, and, ethics, i, e, excessive, consumption, of, alcohol, perceived, laziness, and, inability, to, save, money, in, the, making, of, the, english, working, class, e, p, thompson, argues, that, the, english, working, class, was, present, at, its, own, creation, and, seeks, to, describe, the, transformation, of, pre, modern, labouring, classes, into, a, modern, politically, self, conscious, working, class, starting, around, 1917, a, number, of, countries, became, ruled, ostensibly, in, the, interests, of, the, working, class, see, soviet, working, class, some, historians, have, noted, that, a, key, change, in, these, soviet, style, societies, has, been, a, massive, a, new, type, of, proletarianization, often, effected, by, the, administratively, achieved, forced, displacement, of, peasants, and, rural, workers, since, then, four, major, industrial, states, have, turned, towards, semi, market, based, governance, china, laos, vietnam, cuba, and, one, state, has, turned, inwards, into, an, increasing, cycle, of, poverty, and, brutalization, north, korea, other, states, of, this, sort, have, collapsed, such, as, the, soviet, union, since, 1960, large, scale, proletarianization, and, enclosure, of, commons, has, occurred, in, the, third, world, generating, new, working, classes, additionally, countries, such, as, india, have, been, slowly, undergoing, social, change, expanding, the, size, of, the, urban, working, class, karl, marx, defined, the, working, class, or, proletariat, as, individuals, who, sell, their, labour, power, for, wages, and, who, do, not, own, the, means, of, production, he, argued, that, they, were, responsible, for, creating, the, wealth, of, a, society, he, asserted, that, the, working, class, physically, build, bridges, craft, furniture, grow, food, and, nurse, children, but, do, not, own, land, or, factories, a, sub, section, of, the, proletariat, the, lumpenproletariat, rag, proletariat, are, the, extremely, poor, and, unemployed, such, as, day, labourers, and, homeless, people, marx, considered, them, to, be, devoid, of, class, consciousness, in, the, communist, manifesto, karl, marx, and, friedrich, engels, argued, that, it, was, the, destiny, of, the, working, class, to, displace, the, capitalist, system, with, the, dictatorship, of, the, proletariat, the, rule, of, the, many, as, opposed, to, the, dictatorship, of, the, bourgeoisie, abolishing, the, social, relationships, underpinning, the, class, system, and, then, developing, into, a, future, communist, society, in, which, the, free, development, of, each, is, the, condition, for, the, free, development, of, all, in, general, in, marxist, terms, wage, labourers, and, those, dependent, on, the, welfare, state, are, working, class, and, those, who, live, on, accumulated, capital, are, not, this, broad, dichotomy, defines, the, class, struggle, different, groups, and, individuals, may, at, any, given, time, be, on, one, side, or, the, other, such, contradictions, of, interests, and, identity, within, individuals, lives, and, within, communities, can, effectively, undermine, the, ability, of, the, working, class, to, act, in, solidarity, to, reduce, exploitation, inequality, and, the, role, of, ownership, in, determining, people, s, life, chances, work, conditions, and, political, power, the, informal, working, class, is, a, sociological, term, coined, by, mike, davis, for, a, class, of, over, a, billion, predominantly, young, urban, people, who, are, in, no, way, formally, connected, to, the, global, economy, and, who, try, to, survive, primarily, in, slums, according, to, davis, this, class, no, longer, corresponds, to, the, socio, theoretical, concepts, of, a, class, from, marx, max, weber, or, the, theory, of, modernization, thereafter, this, class, developed, worldwide, from, the, 1960s, especially, in, the, southern, hemisphere, in, contrast, to, previous, notions, of, a, class, of, the, lumpen, proletariat, or, the, notions, of, a, slum, of, hope, from, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, members, of, this, class, are, given, hardly, any, chances, of, attaining, membership, of, the, formal, economic, structures, diane, reay, stresses, the, challenges, that, working, class, students, can, face, during, the, transition, to, and, within, higher, education, and, research, intensive, universities, in, particular, one, factor, can, be, the, university, community, being, perceived, as, a, predominately, middle, class, social, space, creating, a, sense, of, otherness, due, to, class, differences, in, social, norms, and, knowledge, of, navigating, academia, working, classes, in, different, countries
