the, economic, status, of, a, country, by, using, money, that, was, intended, for, welfare, so, called, problem, neighborhoods, exist, in, many, countries, these, neighborhoods, tend, to, have, a,

g, by, working, and, can, result, in, death, infectious, diseases, are, often, public, health, concerns, because, they, can, spread, quickly, and, easily, affecting, large, numbers, of, people, the, world, health, organization, has, an, acute, interest, in, combating, infectious, disease, outbreaks, by, minimizing, their, geographic, and, numerical, spread, and, treating, the, affected, other, conditions, for, which, there, is, not, yet, a, cure, or, even, effective, treatment, such, as, dementia, can, be, viewed, as, public, health, concerns, in, the, long, run, throughout, the, life,

schools, such, as, that, seen, in, the, united, states, the, weak, organizational, policy, in, the, place, and, the, lack, of, communication, between, public, schools, and, the, federal, government, have, led, to, major, effects, on, the, future, generation, public, schools, that, do, not, receive, high, standardized, test, scores, are, not, being, sufficiently, funded, and, as, a, result, their,
