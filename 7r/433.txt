p, li, p, l, i, also, known, as, pali, magadhi, is, a, middle, indo, aryan, liturgical, language, on, the, indian, subcontinent, it, is, widely, studied, because, it, is, the, language, of, the, buddhist, p, li, canon, or, tipi, aka, as, well, as, the, sacred, language, of, therav, da, buddhism, the, word, pali, is, used, as, a, name, for, the, language, of, the, theravada, canon, the, word, seems, to, have, its, origins, in, commentarial, traditions, wherein, the, p, li, in, the, sense, of, the, line, of, original, text, quoted, was, distinguished, from, the, commentary, or, vernacular, translation, that, followed, it, in, the, manuscript, k, r, norman, suggests, that, its, emergence, was, based, on, a, misunderstanding, of, the, compound, p, li, bh, sa, with, p, li, being, interpreted, as, the, name, of, a, particular, language, 1, the, name, pali, does, not, appear, in, the, canonical, literature, and, in, commentary, literature, is, sometimes, substituted, with, tanti, meaning, a, string, or, lineage, 1, this, name, seems, to, have, emerged, in, sri, lanka, early, in, the, second, millennium, ce, during, a, resurgence, in, the, use, of, pali, as, a, courtly, and, literary, language, 1, as, such, the, name, of, the, language, has, caused, some, debate, among, scholars, of, all, ages, the, spelling, of, the, name, also, varies, being, found, with, both, long, and, short, a, and, also, with, either, a, retroflex, or, non, retroflex, l, sound, both, the, long, and, retroflex, are, seen, in, the, iso, 15919, ala, lc, rendering, p, i, however, to, this, day, there, is, no, single, standard, spelling, of, the, term, and, all, four, possible, spellings, can, be, found, in, textbooks, r, c, childers, translates, the, word, as, series, and, states, that, the, language, bears, the, epithet, in, consequence, of, the, perfection, of, its, grammatical, structure, there, is, persistent, confusion, as, to, the, relation, of, p, i, to, the, vernacular, spoken, in, the, ancient, kingdom, of, magadha, which, was, located, in, modern, day, bihar, and, around, modern, day, bengal, beginning, in, the, theravada, commentaries, pali, was, identified, with, magahi, the, language, of, the, kingdom, of, magadha, and, this, was, taken, to, also, be, the, language, that, the, buddha, used, during, his, life, in, the, 19th, century, the, british, orientalist, robert, caesar, childers, argued, that, the, true, or, geographical, name, of, the, pali, language, was, magadhi, prakrit, and, that, because, p, i, means, line, row, series, the, early, buddhists, extended, the, meaning, of, the, term, to, mean, a, series, of, books, so, p, ibh, s, means, language, of, the, texts, however, modern, scholarship, has, regarded, pali, as, a, mix, of, several, prakrit, languages, from, around, the, 3rd, century, bce, combined, and, partially, sanskritized, there, is, no, attested, dialect, of, middle, indo, aryan, with, all, the, features, of, pali, 5, in, the, modern, era, it, has, been, possible, to, compare, pali, with, inscriptions, known, to, be, in, magadhi, prakrit, as, well, as, other, texts, and, grammars, of, that, language, while, none, of, the, existing, sources, specifically, document, pre, ashokan, magadhi, the, available, sources, suggest, that, pali, is, not, equatable, with, that, language, modern, scholars, generally, regard, pali, to, have, originated, from, a, western, dialect, rather, than, an, eastern, one, pali, has, some, commonalities, with, both, the, western, ashokan, edicts, at, girnar, in, saurashtra, and, the, central, western, prakrit, found, in, the, eastern, hathigumpha, inscription, 5, these, similarities, lead, scholars, to, associate, pali, with, this, region, of, western, india, nonetheless, pali, does, retain, some, eastern, features, that, have, been, referred, to, as, m, gadhisms, p, i, as, a, middle, indo, aryan, language, is, different, from, classical, sanskrit, more, with, regard, to, its, dialectal, base, than, the, time, of, its, origin, a, number, of, its, morphological, and, lexical, features, show, that, it, is, not, a, direct, continuation, of, gvedic, sanskrit, instead, it, descends, from, one, or, more, dialects, that, were, despite, many, similarities, different, from, gvedic, the, theravada, commentaries, refer, to, the, pali, language, as, magadhan, or, the, language, of, magadha, 2, this, identification, first, appears, in, the, commentaries, and, may, have, been, an, attempt, by, buddhists, to, associate, themselves, more, closely, with, the, maurya, empire, however, only, some, of, the, buddha, s, teachings, were, delivered, in, the, historical, territory, of, magadha, kingdom, scholars, consider, it, likely, that, he, taught, in, several, closely, related, dialects, of, middle, indo, aryan, which, had, a, high, degree, of, mutual, intelligibility, theravada, tradition, as, recorded, in, chronicles, like, the, mahavamsa, states, that, the, tipitaka, was, first, committed, to, writing, during, the, first, century, bce, 5, this, move, away, from, the, previous, tradition, of, oral, preservation, is, described, as, being, motivated, by, threats, to, the, sangha, from, famine, war, and, the, growing, influence, of, the, rival, tradition, of, the, abhayagiri, vihara, 5, this, account, is, generally, accepted, by, scholars, though, there, are, indications, that, pali, had, already, begun, to, be, recorded, in, writing, by, this, date, 5, by, this, point, in, its, history, scholars, consider, it, likely, that, pali, had, already, undergone, some, initial, assimilation, with, sanskrit, such, as, the, conversion, of, the, middle, indic, bahmana, to, the, more, familiar, sanskrit, br, hmana, that, contemporary, brahmans, used, to, identify, themselves, 6, in, sri, lanka, pali, is, thought, to, have, entered, into, a, period, of, decline, ending, around, the, 4th, or, 5th, century, as, sanskrit, rose, in, prominence, and, simultaneously, as, buddhism, s, adherents, became, a, smaller, portion, of, the, subcontinent, but, ultimately, survived, the, work, of, buddhaghosa, was, largely, responsible, for, its, reemergence, as, an, important, scholarly, language, in, buddhist, thought, the, visuddhimagga, and, the, other, commentaries, that, buddhaghosa, compiled, codified, and, condensed, the, sinhala, commentarial, tradition, that, had, been, preserved, and, expanded, in, sri, lanka, since, the, 3rd, century, bce, with, only, a, few, possible, exceptions, the, entire, corpus, of, pali, texts, known, today, is, believed, to, derive, from, the, anuradhapura, maha, viharaya, in, sri, lanka, while, literary, evidence, exists, of, theravadins, in, mainland, india, surviving, into, the, 13th, century, no, pali, texts, specifically, attributable, to, this, tradition, have, been, recovered, some, texts, such, as, the, milindapanha, may, have, been, composed, in, india, before, being, transmitted, to, sri, lanka, but, the, surviving, versions, of, the, texts, are, those, preserved, by, the, mahavihara, in, ceylon, and, shared, with, monasteries, in, theravada, southeast, asia, the, earliest, inscriptions, in, pali, found, in, mainland, southeast, asia, are, from, the, first, millennium, ce, some, possibly, dating, to, as, early, as, the, 4th, century, inscriptions, are, found, in, what, are, now, burma, laos, thailand, and, cambodia, and, may, have, spread, from, southern, india, rather, than, sri, lanka, by, the, 11th, century, a, so, called, pali, renaissance, began, in, the, vicinity, of, pagan, gradually, spreading, to, the, rest, of, mainland, southeast, asia, as, royal, dynasties, sponsored, monastic, lineages, derived, from, the, mahavihara, of, anuradhapura, this, era, was, also, characterized, by, the, adoption, of, sanskrit, conventions, and, poetic, forms, such, as, kavya, that, had, not, been, features, of, earlier, pali, literature, this, process, began, as, early, as, the, 5th, century, but, intensified, early, in, the, second, millennium, as, pali, texts, on, poetics, and, composition, modeled, on, sanskrit, forms, began, to, grow, in, popularity, one, milestone, of, this, period, was, the, publication, of, the, subodhalankara, during, the, 14th, century, a, work, attributed, to, sangharakkhita, mah, s, mi, and, modeled, on, the, sanskrit, kavyadarsa, peter, masefield, devoted, considerable, research, to, a, form, of, pali, known, as, indochinese, pali, or, kham, pali, up, until, now, this, has, been, considered, a, degraded, form, of, pali, but, masefield, states, that, further, examination, of, a, very, considerable, corpus, of, texts, will, probably, show, that, this, is, an, internally, consistent, pali, dialect, the, reason, for, the, changes, is, that, some, combinations, of, characters, are, difficult, to, write, in, those, scripts, masefield, further, states, that, upon, the, third, re, introduction, of, theravada, buddhism, into, sri, lanka, the, siyamese, sect, records, in, thailand, state, that, large, number, of, texts, were, also, taken, it, seems, that, when, the, monastic, ordination, died, out, in, sri, lanka, many, texts, were, lost, also, therefore, the, sri, lankan, pali, canon, had, been, translated, first, into, indo, chinese, pali, and, then, back, again, into, pali, despite, an, expansion, of, the, number, and, influence, of, mahavihara, derived, monastics, this, resurgence, of, pali, study, resulted, in, no, production, of, any, new, surviving, literary, works, in, pali, during, this, era, correspondences, between, royal, courts, in, sri, lanka, and, mainland, southeast, asia, were, conducted, in, pali, and, grammars, aimed, at, speakers, of, sinhala, burmese, and, other, languages, were, produced, the, emergence, of, the, term, pali, as, the, name, of, the, language, of, the, theravada, canon, also, occurred, during, this, era, while, pali, is, generally, recognized, as, an, ancient, language, no, epigraphical, or, manuscript, evidence, has, survived, from, the, earliest, eras, the, earliest, samples, of, pali, discovered, are, inscriptions, believed, to, date, from, 5th, to, 8th, century, located, in, mainland, southeast, asia, specifically, central, siam, and, lower, burma, these, inscriptions, typically, consist, of, short, excerpts, from, the, pali, canon, and, non, canonical, texts, and, include, several, examples, of, the, ye, dhamma, hetu, verse, the, oldest, surviving, pali, manuscript, was, discovered, in, nepal, dating, to, the, 9th, century, it, is, in, the, form, of, four, palm, leaf, folios, using, a, transitional, script, deriving, from, the, gupta, script, to, scribe, a, fragment, of, the, cullavagga, the, oldest, known, manuscripts, from, sri, lanka, and, southeast, asia, date, to, the, 13th, 15th, century, with, few, surviving, examples, very, few, manuscripts, older, than, 400, years, have, survived, and, complete, manuscripts, of, the, four, nikayas, are, only, available, in, examples, from, the, 17th, century, and, later, pali, was, first, mentioned, in, western, literature, in, simon, de, la, loub, re, s, descriptions, of, his, travels, in, the, kingdom, of, siam, an, early, grammar, and, dictionary, was, published, by, methodist, missionary, benjamin, clough, in, 1824, and, an, initial, study, published, by, eug, ne, burnouf, and, christian, lassen, in, 1826, essai, sur, le, pali, ou, langue, sacr, e, de, la, presqu, le, au, del, du, gange, the, first, modern, pali, english, dictionary, was, published, by, robert, childers, in, 1872, and, 1875, following, the, foundation, of, the, pali, text, society, english, pali, studies, grew, rapidly, and, childer, s, dictionary, became, outdated, planning, for, a, new, dictionary, began, in, the, early, 1900s, but, delays, including, the, outbreak, of, world, war, i, meant, that, work, was, not, completed, until, 1925, t, w, rhys, davids, in, his, book, buddhist, india, and, wilhelm, geiger, in, his, book, p, li, literature, and, language, suggested, that, pali, may, have, originated, as, a, lingua, franca, or, common, language, of, culture, among, people, who, used, differing, dialects, in, north, india, used, at, the, time, of, the, buddha, and, employed, by, him, another, scholar, states, that, at, that, time, it, was, a, refined, and, elegant, vernacular, of, all, aryan, speaking, people, modern, scholarship, has, not, arrived, at, a, consensus, on, the, issue, there, are, a, variety, of, conflicting, theories, with, supporters, and, detractors, after, the, death, of, the, buddha, pali, may, have, evolved, among, buddhists, out, of, the, language, of, the, buddha, as, a, new, artificial, language, r, c, childers, who, held, to, the, theory, that, pali, was, old, magadhi, wrote, had, gautama, never, preached, it, is, unlikely, that, magadhese, would, have, been, distinguished, from, the, many, other, vernaculars, of, hindustan, except, perhaps, by, an, inherent, grace, and, strength, which, make, it, a, sort, of, tuscan, among, the, prakrits, according, to, k, r, norman, differences, between, different, texts, within, the, canon, suggest, that, it, contains, material, from, more, than, a, single, dialect, 2, he, also, suggests, it, is, likely, that, the, viharas, in, north, india, had, separate, collections, of, material, preserved, in, the, local, dialect, 4, in, the, early, period, it, is, likely, that, no, degree, of, translation, was, necessary, in, communicating, this, material, to, other, areas, around, the, time, of, ashoka, there, had, been, more, linguistic, divergence, and, an, attempt, was, made, to, assemble, all, the, material, 4, it, is, possible, that, a, language, quite, close, to, the, pali, of, the, canon, emerged, as, a, result, of, this, process, as, a, compromise, of, the, various, dialects, in, which, the, earliest, material, had, been, preserved, and, this, language, functioned, as, a, lingua, franca, among, eastern, buddhists, from, then, on, 5, following, this, period, the, language, underwent, a, small, degree, of, sanskritisation, i, e, mia, bamhana, brahmana, tta, tva, in, some, cases, bhikkhu, bodhi, summarizing, the, current, state, of, scholarship, states, that, the, language, is, closely, related, to, the, language, or, more, likely, the, various, regional, dialects, that, the, buddha, himself, spoke, he, goes, on, to, write, scholars, regard, this, language, as, a, hybrid, showing, features, of, several, prakrit, dialects, used, around, the, third, century, bce, subjected, to, a, partial, process, of, sanskritization, while, the, language, is, not, identical, to, what, buddha, himself, would, have, spoken, it, belongs, to, the, same, broad, language, family, as, those, he, might, have, used, and, originates, from, the, same, conceptual, matrix, this, language, thus, reflects, the, thought, world, that, the, buddha, inherited, from, the, wider, indian, culture, into, which, he, was, born, so, that, its, words, capture, the, subtle, nuances, of, that, thought, world, according, to, a, k, warder, the, pali, language, is, a, prakrit, language, used, in, a, region, of, western, india, warder, associates, pali, with, the, indian, realm, janapada, of, avanti, where, the, sthavira, nik, ya, was, centered, following, the, initial, split, in, the, buddhist, community, the, sthavira, nik, ya, became, influential, in, western, and, south, india, while, the, mah, s, ghika, branch, became, influential, in, central, and, east, india, akira, hirakawa, and, paul, groner, also, associate, pali, with, western, india, and, the, sthavira, nik, ya, citing, the, saurashtran, inscriptions, which, are, linguistically, closest, to, the, pali, language, although, sanskrit, was, said, in, the, brahmanical, tradition, to, be, the, unchanging, language, spoken, by, the, gods, in, which, each, word, had, an, inherent, significance, such, views, for, any, language, was, not, shared, in, the, early, buddhist, traditions, in, which, words, were, only, conventional, and, mutable, signs, this, view, of, language, naturally, extended, to, pali, and, may, have, contributed, to, its, usage, as, an, approximation, or, standardization, of, local, middle, indic, dialects, in, place, of, sanskrit, however, by, the, time, of, the, compilation, of, the, pali, commentaries, 4th, or, 5th, century, pali, was, described, by, the, anonymous, authors, as, the, natural, language, the, root, language, of, all, beings, 2, comparable, to, ancient, egyptian, latin, or, hebrew, in, the, mystic, traditions, of, the, west, pali, recitations, were, often, thought, to, have, a, supernatural, power, which, could, be, attributed, to, their, meaning, the, character, of, the, reciter, or, the, qualities, of, the, language, itself, and, in, the, early, strata, of, buddhist, literature, we, can, already, see, pali, dh, ra, s, used, as, charms, as, for, example, against, the, bite, of, snakes, many, people, in, theravada, cultures, still, believe, that, taking, a, vow, in, pali, has, a, special, significance, and, as, one, example, of, the, supernatural, power, assigned, to, chanting, in, the, language, the, recitation, of, the, vows, of, a, gulim, la, are, believed, to, alleviate, the, pain, of, childbirth, in, sri, lanka, in, thailand, the, chanting, of, a, portion, of, the, abhidhammapi, aka, is, believed, to, be, beneficial, to, the, recently, departed, and, this, ceremony, routinely, occupies, as, much, as, seven, working, days, there, is, nothing, in, the, latter, text, that, relates, to, this, subject, and, the, origins, of, the, custom, are, unclear, pali, died, out, as, a, literary, language, in, mainland, india, in, the, fourteenth, century, but, survived, elsewhere, until, the, eighteenth, today, pali, is, studied, mainly, to, gain, access, to, buddhist, scriptures, and, is, frequently, chanted, in, a, ritual, context, the, secular, literature, of, pali, historical, chronicles, medical, texts, and, inscriptions, is, also, of, great, historical, importance, the, great, centres, of, pali, learning, remain, in, sri, lanka, and, other, theravada, nations, of, southeast, asia, myanmar, thailand, laos, and, cambodia, since, the, 19th, century, various, societies, for, the, revival, of, pali, studies, in, india, have, promoted, awareness, of, the, language, and, its, literature, including, the, maha, bodhi, society, founded, by, anagarika, dhammapala, in, europe, the, pali, text, society, has, been, a, major, force, in, promoting, the, study, of, pali, by, western, scholars, since, its, founding, in, 1881, based, in, the, united, kingdom, the, society, publishes, romanized, pali, editions, along, with, many, english, translations, of, these, sources, in, 1869, the, first, pali, dictionary, was, published, using, the, research, of, robert, caesar, childers, one, of, the, founding, members, of, the, pali, text, society, it, was, the, first, pali, translated, text, in, english, and, was, published, in, 1872, childers, dictionary, later, received, the, volney, prize, in, 1876, the, pali, text, society, was, founded, in, part, to, compensate, for, the, very, low, level, of, funds, allocated, to, indology, in, late, 19th, century, england, and, the, rest, of, the, uk, incongruously, the, citizens, of, the, uk, were, not, nearly, so, robust, in, sanskrit, and, prakrit, language, studies, as, germany, russia, and, even, denmark, even, without, the, inspiration, of, colonial, holdings, such, as, the, former, british, occupation, of, sri, lanka, and, burma, institutions, such, as, the, danish, royal, library, have, built, up, major, collections, of, pali, manuscripts, and, major, traditions, of, pali, studies, pali, literature, is, usually, divided, into, canonical, and, non, canonical, or, extra, canonical, texts, canonical, texts, include, the, whole, of, the, pali, canon, or, tipitaka, with, the, exception, of, three, books, placed, in, the, khuddaka, nikaya, by, only, the, burmese, tradition, these, texts, consisting, of, the, five, nikayas, of, the, sutta, pitaka, the, vinaya, pitaka, and, the, books, of, the, abhidhamma, pitaka, are, traditionally, accepted, as, containing, the, words, of, the, buddha, and, his, immediate, disciples, by, the, theravada, tradition, extra, canonical, texts, can, be, divided, into, several, categories, other, types, of, texts, present, in, pali, literature, include, works, on, grammar, and, poetics, medical, texts, astrological, and, divination, texts, cosmologies, and, anthologies, or, collections, of, material, from, the, canonical, literature, while, the, majority, of, works, in, pali, are, believed, to, have, originated, with, the, sri, lankan, tradition, and, then, spread, to, other, theravada, regions, some, texts, may, have, other, origins, the, milinda, panha, may, have, originated, in, northern, india, before, being, translated, from, sanskrit, or, gandhari, prakrit, there, are, also, a, number, of, texts, that, are, believed, to, have, been, composed, in, pali, in, sri, lanka, thailand, and, burma, but, were, not, widely, circulated, this, regional, pali, literature, is, currently, relatively, little, known, particularly, in, the, thai, tradition, with, many, manuscripts, never, catalogued, or, published, pai, c, is, a, largely, unattested, literary, language, of, classical, india, that, is, mentioned, in, prakrit, and, sanskrit, grammars, of, antiquity, it, is, found, grouped, with, the, prakrit, languages, with, which, it, shares, some, linguistic, similarities, but, was, not, considered, a, spoken, language, by, the, early, grammarians, because, it, was, understood, to, have, been, purely, a, literary, language, in, works, of, sanskrit, poetics, such, as, da, in, s, kavyadarsha, it, is, also, known, by, the, name, of, bh, tabh, an, epithet, which, can, be, interpreted, as, dead, language, i, e, with, no, surviving, speakers, or, bh, ta, means, past, and, bh, means, language, i, e, a, language, spoken, in, the, past, evidence, which, lends, support, to, this, interpretation, is, that, literature, in, pai, c, is, fragmentary, and, extremely, rare, but, may, once, have, been, common, the, 13th, century, tibetan, historian, buton, rinchen, drub, wrote, that, the, early, buddhist, schools, were, separated, by, choice, of, sacred, language, the, mah, s, ghikas, used, prakrit, the, sarv, stiv, dins, used, sanskrit, the, sthavirav, dins, used, pai, c, and, the, sa, mit, ya, used, apabhra, a, this, observation, has, led, some, scholars, to, theorize, connections, between, pali, and, pai, c, sten, konow, concluded, that, it, may, have, been, an, indo, aryan, language, spoken, by, dravidian, people, in, south, india, and, alfred, master, noted, a, number, of, similarities, between, surviving, fragments, and, pali, morphology, ardhamagadhi, prakrit, was, a, middle, indo, aryan, language, and, a, dramatic, prakrit, thought, to, have, been, spoken, in, modern, day, bihar, eastern, uttar, pradesh, and, used, in, some, early, buddhist, and, jain, drama, it, was, originally, thought, to, be, a, predecessor, of, the, vernacular, magadhi, prakrit, hence, the, name, literally, half, magadhi, ardham, gadh, was, prominently, used, by, jain, scholars, and, is, preserved, in, the, jain, agamas, ardhamagadhi, prakrit, differs, from, later, magadhi, prakrit, in, similar, ways, to, pali, and, was, often, believed, to, be, connected, with, pali, on, the, basis, of, the, belief, that, pali, recorded, the, speech, of, the, buddha, in, an, early, magadhi, dialect, magadhi, prakrit, was, a, middle, indic, language, spoken, in, present, day, bihar, and, eastern, uttar, pradesh, its, use, later, expanded, southeast, to, include, some, regions, of, modern, day, bengal, odisha, and, assam, and, it, was, used, in, some, prakrit, dramas, to, represent, vernacular, dialogue, preserved, examples, of, magadhi, prakrit, are, from, several, centuries, after, the, theorized, lifetime, of, the, buddha, and, include, inscriptions, attributed, to, asoka, maurya, differences, observed, between, preserved, examples, of, magadhi, prakrit, and, pali, lead, scholars, to, conclude, that, pali, represented, a, development, of, a, northwestern, dialect, of, middle, indic, rather, than, being, a, continuation, of, a, language, spoken, in, the, area, of, magadha, in, the, time, of, the, buddha, nearly, every, word, in, p, i, has, cognates, in, the, other, middle, indo, aryan, languages, the, prakrits, the, relationship, to, vedic, sanskrit, is, less, direct, and, more, complicated, the, prakrits, were, descended, from, old, indo, aryan, vernaculars, historically, influence, between, pali, and, sanskrit, has, been, felt, in, both, directions, the, pali, language, s, resemblance, to, sanskrit, is, often, exaggerated, by, comparing, it, to, later, sanskrit, compositions, which, were, written, centuries, after, sanskrit, ceased, to, be, a, living, language, and, are, influenced, by, developments, in, middle, indic, including, the, direct, borrowing, of, a, portion, of, the, middle, indic, lexicon, whereas, a, good, deal, of, later, pali, technical, terminology, has, been, borrowed, from, the, vocabulary, of, equivalent, disciplines, in, sanskrit, either, directly, or, with, certain, phonological, adaptations, post, canonical, pali, also, possesses, a, few, loan, words, from, local, languages, where, pali, was, used, e, g, sri, lankans, adding, sinhala, words, to, pali, these, usages, differentiate, the, pali, found, in, the, suttapi, aka, from, later, compositions, such, as, the, pali, commentaries, on, the, canon, and, folklore, e, g, commentaries, on, the, jataka, tales, and, comparative, study, and, dating, of, texts, on, the, basis, of, such, loan, words, is, now, a, specialized, field, unto, itself, pali, was, not, exclusively, used, to, convey, the, teachings, of, the, buddha, as, can, be, deduced, from, the, existence, of, a, number, of, secular, texts, such, as, books, of, medical, science, instruction, in, pali, however, scholarly, interest, in, the, language, has, been, focused, upon, religious, and, philosophical, literature, because, of, the, unique, window, it, opens, on, one, phase, in, the, development, of, buddhism, vowels, may, be, divided, in, two, different, ways, long, and, short, vowels, are, only, contrastive, in, open, syllables, in, closed, syllables, all, vowels, are, always, short, short, and, long, e, and, o, are, in, complementary, distribution, the, short, variants, occur, only, in, closed, syllables, the, long, variants, occur, only, in, open, syllables, short, and, long, e, and, o, are, therefore, not, distinct, phonemes, e, and, o, are, long, in, an, open, syllable, at, the, end, of, a, syllable, as, in, to, lead, or, to, hear, they, are, short, in, a, closed, syllable, when, followed, by, a, consonant, with, which, they, make, a, syllable, as, in, indifference, or, safety, e, appears, for, a, before, doubled, consonants, the, vowels, i, and, u, are, lengthened, in, the, flexional, endings, including, hi, hi, and, su, a, sound, called, anusv, ra, skt, pali, niggah, ta, represented, by, the, letter, iso, 15919, or, ala, lc, in, romanization, and, by, a, raised, dot, in, most, traditional, alphabets, originally, marked, the, fact, that, the, preceding, vowel, was, nasalized, that, is, a, i, and, u, represented, and, in, many, traditional, pronunciations, however, the, anusv, ra, is, pronounced, more, strongly, like, the, velar, nasal, so, that, these, sounds, are, pronounced, instead, and, however, pronounced, never, follows, a, long, vowel, and, are, converted, to, the, corresponding, short, vowels, when, is, added, to, a, stem, ending, in, a, long, vowel, e, g, kath, becomes, katha, not, kath, dev, becomes, devi, not, dev, changes, of, vowels, due, to, the, structure, of, the, word, final, vowels, the, final, consonants, of, the, sanskrit, words, have, been, dropped, in, pali, and, thus, all, the, words, end, in, a, vowel, or, in, a, nasal, vowel, k, nt, t, kant, from, the, loved, one, k, nt, kanta, the, loved, one, the, final, vowels, were, usually, weak, in, pronunciation, and, hence, they, were, shortened, ak, rsit, ak, si, he, did, among, the, labial, consonants, is, labiodental, and, the, rest, are, bilabial, among, the, dental, alveolar, consonants, the, majority, is, dental, but, and, are, alveolar, of, the, sounds, listed, above, only, the, three, consonants, in, parentheses, and, h, are, not, distinct, phonemes, in, pali, only, occurs, before, velar, stops, while, and, h, are, intervocalic, allophones, of, single, and, h, in, the, pali, language, the, consonants, may, be, divided, according, to, their, strength, or, power, of, resistance, the, strength, decreases, in, the, order, of, mutes, sibilant, nasals, l, v, y, r, when, two, consonants, come, together, they, are, subject, to, one, of, the, following, change, aspirate, consonants, when, one, of, the, two, consonants, is, the, sibilant, s, then, the, new, group, of, consonants, has, the, aspiration, in, the, last, consonant, as, ti, root, as, atthi, is, the, sibilant, s, followed, by, a, nasal, is, changed, to, h, and, then, it, is, transposed, after, the, nasal, metathesis, akas, ma, akah, ma, akamha, we, did, alternation, between, y, and, v, pali, v, appears, for,

and, l, representation, of, r, by, l, is, very, common, in, pali, and, in, pkr, it, is, the, rule, for, magadhi, although, this, substitution, occurs, sporadically, also, in, other, dialect, this,

the, common, characteristics, of, pali, and, sanskrit, were, always, easily, recognized, by, those, in, india, who, were, familiar, with, both, a, large, part, of, pali, and, sanskrit, word, stems, are, identical, in, form, differing, only, in, details, of, inflection, technical, terms, from, sanskrit, were, converted, into, pali, by, a, set, of, conventional, phonological, transformations, these, transformations, mimicked, a, subset, of, the, phonological, developments, that, had, occurred, in, proto, pali, because, of, the, prevalence, of, these, transformations, it, is, not, always, possible, to, tell, whether, a, given, pali, word, is, a, part, of, the, old, prakrit, lexicon, or, a, transformed, borrowing, from, sanskrit, the, existence, of, a, sanskrit, word, regularly, corresponding, to, a, pali, word, is, not, always, secure, evidence, of, the, pali, etymology, since, in, some, cases, artificial, sanskrit, words, were, created, by, back, formation, from, prakrit, words, the, following, phonological, processes, are, not, intended, as, an, exhaustive, description, of, the, historical, changes, which, produced, pali, from, its, old, indic, ancestor, but, rather, are, a, summary, of, the, most, common, phonological, equations, between, sanskrit, and, pali, with, no, claim, to, completeness, total, assimilation, where, one, sound, becomes, identical, to, a, neighboring, sound, is, of, two, types, progressive, where, the, assimilated, sound, becomes, identical, to, the, following, sound, and, regressive, where, it, becomes, identical, to, the, preceding, sound, an, epenthetic, vowel, is, sometimes, inserted, between, certain, consonant, sequences, as, with, the, vowel, may, be, a, i, or, u, depending, on, the, influence, of, a, neighboring, consonant, or, of, the, vowel, in, the, following, syllable, i, is, often, found, near, i, y, or, palatal, consonants, u, is, found, near, u, v, or, labial, consonants, there, are, several, notable, exceptions,

regional, prakrit, languages, in, brahmi, script, all, of, which, are, quite, similar, to, pali, historically, the, first, written, record, of, the, pali, canon, is, believed, to, have, been, composed, in, sri, lanka, based, on, a, prior, oral, tradition, according, to, the, mahavamsa, the, chronicle, of, sri, lanka, due, to, a, major, famine, in, the, country, buddhist, monks, wrote, down, the, pali, canon, during, the, time, of, king, vattagamini, in, 100, bce, bilingual, coins, containing, pali, written, in, the, kharosthi, script, and, greek, writing, were, used, by, james, prinsep, to, decipher, the, kharosthi, abugida, this, script, became, particularly, significant, for, the, study, of, early, buddhism, following, the, discovery, of, the, gandharan, buddhist, texts, the, transmission, of, written, pali, has, retained, a, universal, system, of, alphabetic, values, but, has, expressed, those, values, in, a, variety, of, different, scripts, in, the, 1840s, thai, king, mongkut, invented, the, ariyaka, script, adapted, from, the, greek, and, burmese, mon, scripts, as, a, universal, medium, for, transcribing, pali, intended, to, replace, other, existing, regional, scripts, including, khom, thai, and, tai, tham, the, script, did, not, come, into, popular, use, theravada, buddhist, professing, regions, use, distinct, scripts, to, transcribe, pali, since, the, 19th, century, pali, has, also, been, written, in, the, roman, script, an, alternate, scheme, devised, by, frans, velthuis, called, the, velthuis, scheme, see, text, in, ascii, allows, for, typing, without, diacritics, using, plain, ascii, methods, but, is, arguably, less, readable, than, the, standard, iast, system, which, uses, diacritical, marks, the, pali, alphabetical, order, is, as, follows, h, although, a, single, sound, is, written, with, ligature, of, and, h, there, are, several, fonts, to, use, for, pali, transliteration, however, older, ascii, fonts, such, as, leedsbit, palitranslit, times, norman, times, csx, skt, times, vri, romanpali, cn, cb, etc, are, not, recommendable, they, are, deprecated, since, they, are, not, compatible, with, one, another, and, are, technically, out, of, date, instead, fonts, based, on, the, unicode, standard, are, recommended, however, not, all, unicode, fonts, contain, the, necessary, characters, to, properly, display, all, the, diacritic, marks, used, for, romanized, pali, or, for, that, matter, sanskrit, a, unicode, font, must, contain, the, following, character, ranges, some, unicode, fonts, freely, available, for, typesetting, romanized, pali, are, as, follows, some, of, the, latest, fonts, coming, with, windows, 7, can, also, be, used, to, type, transliterated, pali, arial, calibri, cambria, courier, new,

1991, by, frans, velthuis, for, use, with, his, devnag, devan, gar, font, designed, for, the, tex, typesetting, system, this, system, of, representing, pali, diacritical, marks, has, been, used, in, some, websites, and, discussion, lists, however, as, the, web, itself, and, email, software, slowly, evolve, towards, the, unicode, encoding, standard, this, system, has, become, almost, unnecessary, and, obsolete, the, following, table, compares, various, conventional, renderings, and, shortcut, key, assignments, pali, has, influenced, the, languages, of, mainland, southeast, asia, and, south, asia, to, various, degrees, among, them, burmese, khmer, and, lao, sinhala, and, thai, in, cambodia, pali, replaced, sanskrit, as, a, prestige, language, in, the, 13th, century, coinciding, with, the, spread, of, theravada, buddhism, there, throughout, the, 1900s, chuon, nath, used, pali, roots, to, coin, khmer, neologisms, to, describe, modern, phenomena, such, as, the, train, similarly, in, 20th, century, thailand, and, laos, local, scholars, including, jit, bhumisak, and, vajiravudh, coined, new, words, using, pali, roots, to, describe, foreign, concepts, and, technological, innovations, in, myanmar, since, its, earliest, stage, as, old, burmese, the, burmese, language, has, readily, adopted, thousands, of, loanwords, from, pali, particularly, in, the, domains, of, religion, government, arts, and, science, whereas, the, adoption, of, sanskrit, loanwords, has, been, confined, to, specialized, subjects, like, astrology, astronomy, and, medicine, the, first, to, tenth, ordinal, numbers, in, burmese, are, also, directly, borrowed, form, pali, burmese, has, a, long, history, of, using, and, repurposing, pali, roots, to, coin, burmese, neologisms, well, into, the, 20th, century, including, the, words, for, feudalism, from, pali, padesa, r, ja, organization, from, pali, samagga, and, leader, from, pali, ukka, ha, pali, has, also, influenced, burmese, grammatical, structures, particularly, in, the, literary, register, of, burmese, by, the, 13th, century, the, third, person, pronoun, in, pali, so, had, become, grammaticized, into, the, burmese, grammatical, particle, so, which, is, still, used, to, modify, nouns, following, pali, syntax, until, the, 19th, century, burmese, prose, writing, was, heavily, influenced, by, pali, texts, in, particular, nissaya, texts, that, first, emerged, in, the, 15th, century, in, sri, lanka, pali, has, enriched, the, sinhala, language, since, the, anuradhapura, period, particularly, in, the, realm, of, literature, as, exemplified, by, the, dipavamsa, and, mahavamsa, chronicles, both, written, in, pali, verse, following, the, anuradhapura, period, sanskrit, became, more, influential, in, the, development, of, sinhala
