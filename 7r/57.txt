percent, of, sales, activity, must, be, to, end, users, retailing, often, occurs, in, retail, stores, or, service, establishments, but, may, also, occur, through, direct, selling, such, as, through, vending, machines, door, to, door, sales, or, electronic, channels, although, the, idea, of, retail, is, often, associated, with, the, purchase, of, goods, the, term, may, be, applied, to, service,

retail, markets, have, existed, since, ancient, times, archaeological, evidence, for, trade, probably, involving, barter, systems, dates, back, more, than, 10, 000, years, as, civilizations, grew, barter, was, replaced, with, retail, trade, involving, coinage, selling, and, buying, are, thought, to, have, emerged, in, asia, minor, modern, turkey, in, around, the, 7th, millennium, bce, in, ancient, greece, markets, operated, within, the, agora, an, open, space, where, on, market, days, goods, were, displayed, on, mats, or, temporary, stalls, in, ancient, rome, trade, took, place, in, the, forum, the, roman, forum, was, arguably, the, earliest, example, of, a, permanent, retail, shop, front, research, from, july, 2008, suggests, that, china, exhibited, a, rich, history, of, early, retail, systems, from, as, early, as, 200, bce, chinese, packaging, and, branding, were, used, to, signal, family, place, names, and, product, quality, and, the, use, of, government, imposed, product, branding, was, used, between, 600, and, 900, ce, eckhart, and, bengtsson, have, argued, that, during, the, song, dynasty, 960, 1127, chinese, society, developed, a, consumerist, culture, where, a, high, level, of, consumption, was, attainable, for, a, wide, variety, of, ordinary, consumers, rather, than, just, the, elite, in, medieval, england, and, europe, relatively, few, permanent, shops, were, to, be, found, instead, customers, walked, into, the, tradesman, s, workshops, where, they, discussed, purchasing, options, directly, with, tradesmen, in, the, more, populous, cities, a, small, number, of, shops, were, beginning, to, emerge, by, the, 13th, century, outside, the, major, cities, most, consumable, purchases, were, made, through, markets, or, fairs, market, places, appear, to, have, emerged, independently, outside, europe, the, grand, bazaar, in, istanbul, is, often, cited, as, the, world, s, oldest, continuously, operating, market, its, construction, began, in, 1455, the, spanish, conquistadors, wrote, glowingly, of, markets, in, the, americas, in, the, 15th, century, the, mexica, aztec, market, of, tlatelolco, was, the, largest, in, all, the, americas, by, the, 17th, century, permanent, shops, with, more, regular, trading, hours, were, beginning, to, supplant, markets, and, fairs, as, the, main, retail, outlet, provincial, shopkeepers, were, active, in, almost, every, english, market, town, as, the, number, of, shops, grew, they, underwent, a, transformation, the, trappings, of, a, modern, shop, which, had, been, entirely, absent, from, the, sixteenth, and, early, seventeenth, century, store, gradually, made, way, for, store, interiors, and, shopfronts, that, are, more, familiar, to, modern, shoppers, prior, to, the, eighteenth, century, the, typical, retail, store, had, no, counter, display, cases, chairs, mirrors, changing, rooms, etc, however, the, opportunity, for, the, customer, to, browse, merchandise, touch, and, feel, products, began, to, be, available, with, retail, innovations, from, the, late, 17th, and, early, 18th, centuries, by, the, late, 18th, century, grand, shopping, arcades, began, to, emerge, across, europe, and, in, the, antipodes, a, shopping, arcade, refers, to, a, multiple, vendor, space, operating, under, a, covered, roof, typically, the, roof, was, constructed, of, glass, to, allow, for, natural, light, and, to, reduce, the, need, for, candles, or, electric, lighting, some, of, the, earliest, examples, of, shopping, arcade, appeared, in, paris, due, to, its, lack, of, pavement, for, pedestrians, while, the, arcades, were, the, province, of, the, bourgeoisie, a, new, type, of, retail, venture, emerged, to, serve, the, needs, of, the, working, poor, john, stuart, mill, wrote, about, the, rise, of, the, co, operative, retail, store, which, he, witnessed, first, hand, in, the, mid, nineteenth, century, the, modern, era, of, retailing, is, defined, as, the, period, from, the, industrial, revolution, to, the, 21st, century, in, major, cities, the, department, store, emerged, in, the, mid, to, late, 19th, century, and, permanently, reshaped, shopping, habits, and, redefined, concepts, of, service, and, luxury, many, of, the, early, department, stores, were, more, than, just, a, retail, emporium, rather, they, were, venues, where, shoppers, could, spend, their, leisure, time, and, be, entertained, retail, using, mail, order, came, of, age, during, the, mid, 19th, century, although, catalogue, sales, had, been, used, since, the, 15th, century, this, method, of, retailing, was, confined, to, a, few, industries, such, as, the, sale, of, books, and, seeds, however, improvements, in, transport, and, postal, services, led, several, entrepreneurs, on, either, side, of, the, atlantic, to, experiment, with, catalogue, sales, in, the, post, war, period, an, american, architect, victor, gruen, developed, a, concept, for, a, shopping, mall, a, planned, self, contained, shopping, complex, complete, with, an, indoor, plaza, statues, planting, schemes, piped, music, and, car, parking, gruen, s, vision, was, to, create, a, shopping, atmosphere, where, people, felt, so, comfortable, they, would, spend, more, time, in, the, environment, thereby, enhancing, opportunities, for, purchasing, the, first, of, these, malls, opened, at, northland, mall, near, detroit, in, 1954, throughout, the, twentieth, century, a, trend, towards, larger, store, footprints, became, discernible, the, average, size, of, a, u, s, supermarket, grew, from, 31, 000, square, feet, 2, 900, m, 2, square, feet, in, 1991, to, 44, 000, square, feet, 4, 100, m, 2, square, feet, in, 2000, by, the, end, of, the, twentieth, century, stores, were, using, labels, such, as, mega, stores, and, warehouse, stores, to, reflect, their, growing, size, the, upward, trend, of, increasing, retail, space, was, not, consistent, across, nations, and, led, in, the, early, 21st, century, to, a, 2, fold, difference, in, square, footage, per, capita, between, the, united, states, and, europe, as, the, 21st, century, takes, shape, some, indications, suggest, that, large, retail, stores, have, come, under, increasing, pressure, from, online, sales, models, and, that, reductions, in, store, size, are, evident, under, such, competition, and, other, issues, such, as, business, debt, there, has, been, a, noted, business, disruption, called, the, retail, apocalypse, in, recent, years, which, several, retail, businesses, especially, in, north, america, are, sharply, reducing, their, number, of, stores, or, going, out, of, business, entirely, the, distinction, between, strategic, and, managerial, decision, making, is, commonly, used, to, distinguish, two, phases, having, different, goals, and, based, on, different, conceptual, tools, strategic, planning, concerns, the, choice, of, policies, aiming, at, improving, the, competitive, position, of, the, firm, taking, account, of, challenges, and, opportunities, proposed, by, the, competitive, environment, on, the, other, hand, managerial, decision, making, is, focused, on, the, implementation, of, specific, targets, in, retailing, the, strategic, plan, is, designed, to, set, out, the, vision, and, provide, guidance, for, retail, decision, makers, and, provide, an, outline, of, how, the, product, and, service, mix, will, optimize, customer, satisfaction, as, part, of, the, strategic, planning, process, it, is, customary, for, strategic, planners, to, carry, out, a, detailed, environmental, scan, which, seeks, to, identify, trends, and, opportunities, in, the, competitive, environment, market, environment, economic, environment, and, statutory, political, environment, the, retail, strategy, is, normally, devised, or, reviewed, every, three, to, five, years, by, the, chief, executive, officer, the, profit, margins, of, retailers, depend, largely, on, their, ability, to, achieve, market, competitive, transaction, costs, the, strategic, retail, analysis, typically, includes, following, elements, at, the, conclusion, of, the, retail, analysis, retail, marketers, should, have, a, clear, idea, of, which, groups, of, customers, are, to, be, the, target, of, marketing, activities, not, all, elements, are, however, equal, often, with, demographics, shopping, motivations, and, spending, directing, consumer, activities, retail, research, studies, suggest, that, there, is, a, strong, relationship, between, a, store, s, positioning, and, the, socio, economic, status, of, customers, in, addition, the, retail, strategy, including, service, quality, has, a, significant, and, positive, association, with, customer, loyalty, a, marketing, strategy, effectively, outlines, all, key, aspects, of, firms, targeted, audience, demographics, preferences, in, a, highly, competitive, market, the, retail, strategy, sets, up, long, term, sustainability, it, focuses, on, customer, relationships, stressing, the, importance, of, added, value, customer, satisfaction, and, highlights, how, the, store, s, market, positioning, appeals, to, targeted, groups, of, customers, a, retail, mix, is, devised, for, the, purpose, of, coordinating, day, to, day, tactical, decisions, the, retail, marketing, mix, typically, consists, of, six, broad, decision, layers, including, product, decisions, place, decisions, promotion, price, personnel, and, presentation, also, known, as, physical, evidence, the, retail, mix, is, loosely, based, on, the, marketing, mix, but, has, been, expanded, and, modified, in, line, with, the, unique, needs, of, the, retail, context, a, number, of, scholars, have, argued, for, an, expanded, marketing, mix, with, the, inclusion, of, two, new, ps, namely, personnel, and, presentation, since, these, contribute, to, the, customer, s, unique, retail, experience, and, are, the, principal, basis, for, retail, differentiation, yet, other, scholars, argue, that, the, retail, format, i, e, retail, formula, should, be, included, the, modified, retail, marketing, mix, that, is, most, commonly, cited, in, textbooks, is, often, called, the, 6, ps, of, retailing, see, diagram, at, right, the, primary, product, related, decisions, facing, the, retailer, are, the, product, assortment, what, product, lines, how, many, lines, and, which, brands, to, carry, the, type, of, customer, service, high, contact, through, to, self, service, and, the, availability, of, support, services, e, g, credit, terms, delivery, services, after, sales, care, these, decisions, depend, on, careful, analysis, of, the, market, demand, competition, as, well, as, the, retailer, s, skills, and, expertise, customer, service, is, the, sum, of, acts, and, elements, that, allow, consumers, to, receive, what, they, need, or, desire, from, retail, establishment, retailers, must, decide, whether, to, provide, a, full, service, outlet, or, minimal, service, outlet, such, as, no, service, in, the, case, of, vending, machines, self, service, with, only, basic, sales, assistance, or, a, full, service, operation, as, in, many, boutiques, and, speciality, stores, in, addition, the, retailer, needs, to, make, decisions, about, sales, support, such, as, customer, delivery, and, after, sales, customer, care, place, decisions, are, primarily, concerned, with, consumer, access, and, may, involve, location, space, utilisation, and, operating, hours, retailers, may, consider, a, range, of, both, qualitative, and, quantitative, factors, to, evaluate, to, potential, sites, under, consideration, macro, factors, include, market, characteristics, demographic, economic, and, socio, cultural, demand, competition, and, infrastructure, e, g, the, availability, of, power, roads, public, transport, systems, micro, factors, include, the, size, of, the, site, e, g, availability, of, parking, access, for, delivery, vehicles, a, major, retail, trend, has, been, the, shift, to, multi, channel, retailing, to, counter, the, disruption, caused, by, online, retail, many, bricks, and, mortar, retailers, have, entered, the, online, retail, space, by, setting, up, online, catalogue, sales, and, e, commerce, websites, however, many, retailers, have, noticed, that, consumers, behave, differently, when, shopping, online, for, instance, in, terms, of, choice, of, online, platform, shoppers, tend, to, choose, the, online, site, of, their, preferred, retailer, initially, but, as, they, gain, more, experience, in, online, shopping, they, become, less, loyal, and, more, likely, to, switch, to, other, retail, sites, online, stores, are, usually, available, 24, hours, a, day, and, many, consumers, across, the, globe, have, internet, access, both, at, work, and, at, home, the, broad, pricing, strategy, is, normally, established, in, the, company, s, overall, strategic, plan, in, the, case, of, chain, stores, the, pricing, strategy, would, be, set, by, head, office, broadly, there, are, six, approaches, to, pricing, strategy, mentioned, in, the, marketing, literature, operations, oriented, revenue, oriented, customer, oriented, value, based, relationship, oriented, and, socially, oriented, when, decision, makers, have, determined, the, broad, approach, to, pricing, i, e, the, pricing, strategy, they, turn, their, attention, to, pricing, tactics, tactical, pricing, decisions, are, shorter, term, prices, designed, to, accomplish, specific, short, term, goals, pricing, tactics, that, are, commonly, used, in, retail, include, discount, pricing, everyday, low, prices, high, low, pricing, loss, leaders, product, bundling, promotional, pricing, and, psychological, pricing, two, strategies, to, entice, the, buyer, money, back, guarantee, and, buy, one, get, one, free, were, devised, by, 18th, century, retail, entrepreneur, josiah, wedgwood, retailers, must, also, plan, for, customer, preferred, payment, modes, e, g, cash, credit, lay, by, electronic, funds, transfer, at, point, of, sale, eftpos, all, payment, options, require, some, type, of, handling, and, attract, costs, contrary, to, common, misconception, price, is, not, the, most, important, factor, for, consumers, when, deciding, to, buy, a, product, because, patronage, at, a, retail, outlet, varies, flexibility, in, scheduling, is, desirable, employee, scheduling, software, is, sold, which, using, known, patterns, of, customer, patronage, more, or, less, reliably, predicts, the, need, for, staffing, for, various, functions, at, times, of, the, year, day, of, the, month, or, week, and, time, of, day, usually, needs, vary, widely, conforming, staff, utilization, to, staffing, needs, requires, a, flexible, workforce, which, is, available, when, needed, but, does, not, have, to, be, paid, when, they, are, not, part, time, workers, as, of, 2012, 70, of, retail, workers, in, the, united, states, were, part, time, this, may, result, in, financial, problems, for, the, workers, who, while, they, are, required, to, be, available, at, all, times, if, their, work, hours, are, to, be, maximized, may, not, have, sufficient, income, to, meet, their, family, and, other, obligations, retailers, can, employ, different, techniques, to, enhance, sales, volume, and, to, improve, the, customer, experience, such, as, add, on, upsell, or, cross, sell, selling, on, value, and, knowing, when, to, close, the, sale, transactional, marketing, aims, to, find, target, consumers, then, negotiate, trade, and, finally, end, relationships, to, complete, the, transaction, in, this, one, time, transaction, process, both, parties, aim, to, maximize, their, own, interests, as, a, result, transactional, marketing, raises, follow, up, problems, such, as, poor, after, sales, service, quality, and, a, lack, of, feedback, channels, for, both, parties, in, addition, because, retail, enterprises, needed, to, redevelop, client, relationships, for, each, transaction, marketing, costs, were, high, and, customer, retention, was, low, all, these, downsides, to, transactional, marketing, gradually, pushed, the, retail, industry, towards, establishing, long, term, cooperative, relationships, with, customers, through, this, lens, enterprises, began, to, focus, on, the, process, from, transaction, to, relationship, while, expanding, the, sales, market, and, attracting, new, customers, is, very, important, for, the, retail, industry, it, is, also, important, to, establish, and, maintain, long, term, good, relationships, with, previous, customers, hence, the, name, of, the, underlying, concept, relational, marketing, under, this, concept, retail, enterprises, value, and, attempt, to, improve, relationships, with, customers, as, customer, relationships, are, conducive, to, maintaining, stability, in, the, current, competitive, retail, market, and, are, also, the, future, of, retail, enterprises, presentation, refers, to, the, physical, evidence, that, signals, the, retail, image, physical, evidence, may, include, a, diverse, range, of, elements, the, store, itself, including, premises, offices, exterior, facade, and, interior, layout, websites, delivery, vans, warehouses, staff, uniforms, the, environment, in, which, the, retail, service, encounter, occurs, is, sometimes, known, as, the, retail, servicescape, the, store, environment, consists, of, many, elements, such, as, aromas, the, physical, environment, furnishings, layout, and, functionality, ambient, conditions, lighting, air, temperature, and, music, as, well, as, signs, symbols, and, artifacts, e, g, sales, promotions, shelf, space, sample, stations, visual, communications, retail, designers, pay, close, attention, to, the, front, of, the, store, which, is, known, as, the, decompression, zone, in, order, to, maximize, the, number, of, selling, opportunities, retailers, generally, want, customers, to, spend, more, time, in, a, retail, store, however, this, must, be, balanced, against, customer, expectations, surrounding, convenience, access, and, realistic, waiting, times, the, way, that, brands, are, displayed, is, also, part, of, the, overall, retail, design, where, a, product, is, placed, on, the, shelves, has, implications, for, purchase, likelihood, as, a, result, of, visibility, and, access, ambient, conditions, such, as, lighting, temperature, and, music, are, also, part, of, the, overall, retail, environment, it, is, common, for, a, retail, store, to, play, music, that, relates, to, their, target, market, two, different, strands, of, research, have, investigated, shopper, behaviour, one, is, primarily, concerned, with, shopper, motivations, the, other, stream, of, research, seeks, to, segment, shoppers, according, to, common, shared, characteristics, to, some, extent, these, streams, of, research, are, inter, related, but, each, stream, offers, different, types, of, insights, into, shopper, behaviour, babin, et, al, carried, out, some, of, the, earliest, investigations, into, shopper, motivations, and, identified, two, broad, motives, utilitarian, and, hedonic, utilitarian, motivations, are, task, related, and, rational, for, the, shopper, with, utilitarian, motives, purchasing, is, a, work, related, task, that, is, to, be, accomplished, in, the, most, efficient, and, expedient, manner, on, the, other, hand, hedonic, motives, refer, to, pleasure, the, shopper, with, hedonic, motivations, views, shopping, as, a, form, of, escapism, where, they, are, free, to, indulge, fantasy, and, freedom, hedonic, shoppers, are, more, involved, in, the, shopping, experience, many, different, shopper, profiles, can, be, identified, retailers, develop, customised, segmentation, analyses, for, each, unique, outlet, however, it, is, possible, to, identify, a, number, of, broad, shopper, profiles, one, of, the, most, well, known, and, widely, cited, shopper, typologies, is, that, developed, by, sproles, and, kendal, in, the, mid, 1980s, sproles, and, kendall, s, consumer, typology, has, been, shown, to, be, relatively, consistent, across, time, and, across, cultures, their, typology, is, based, on, the, consumer, s, approach, to, making, purchase, decisions, some, researchers, have, adapted, sproles, and, kendall, s, methodology, for, use, in, specific, countries, or, cultural, groups, consumer, decision, styles, are, important, for, retailers, and, marketers, because, they, describe, behaviours, that, are, relatively, stable, over, time, and, for, this, reason, they, are, useful, for, market, segmentation, retail, formats, also, known, as, retail, formulas, influence, the, consumer, s, store, choice, and, addresses, the, consumer, s, expectations, at, its, most, basic, level, a, retail, format, is, a, simple, marketplace, that, is, a, location, where, goods, and, services, are, exchanged, in, some, parts, of, the, world, the, retail, sector, is, still, dominated, by, small, family, run, stores, but, large, retail, chains, are, increasingly, dominating, the, sector, because, they, can, exert, considerable, buying, power, and, pass, on, the, savings, in, the, form, of, lower, prices, many, of, these, large, retail, chains, also, produce, their, own, private, labels, which, compete, alongside, manufacturer, brands, considerable, consolidation, of, retail, stores, has, changed, the, retail, landscape, transferring, power, away, from, wholesalers, and, into, the, hands, of, the, large, retail, chains, in, britain, and, europe, the, retail, sale, of, goods, is, designated, as, a, service, activity, the, european, service, directive, applies, to, all, retail, trade, including, periodic, markets, street, traders, and, peddlers, retail, stores, may, be, classified, by, the, type, of, product, carried, softline, retailers, sell, goods, that, are, consumed, after, a, single, use, or, have, a, limited, life, typically, under, three, years, in, they, are, normally, consumed, soft, goods, include, clothing, other, fabrics, footwear, toiletries, cosmetics, medicines, and, stationery, grocery, stores, including, supermarkets, and, hypermarkets, along, with, convenience, stores, carry, a, mix, of, food, products, and, consumable, household, items, such, as, detergents, cleansers, personal, hygiene, products, retailers, selling, consumer, durables, are, sometimes, known, as, hardline, retailers, automobiles, appliances, electronics, furniture, sporting, goods, lumber, etc, and, parts, for, them, specialist, retailers, operate, in, many, industries, such, as, the, arts, e, g, green, grocers, contemporary, art, galleries, bookstores, handicrafts, musical, instruments, gift, shops, to, achieve, and, maintain, a, foothold, in, an, existing, market, a, prospective, retail, establishment, must, overcome, the, following, hurdles, when, discussing, the, impact, of, technology, on, shopping, and, retail, e, commerce, is, often, the, first, thing, that, comes, to, mind, for, retailers, however, technologies, such, as, big, data, artificial, intelligence, computer, vision, and, the, internet, of, things, have, used, data, to, transform, every, part, of, the, shopping, experience, from, browsing, to, checkout, it, is, important, for, organizations, to, embrace, digital, disruption, in, order, to, gain, a, competitive, advantage, when, an, industry, experiences, digital, disruption, it, typically, signals, that, consumer, needs, are, shifting, retailers, enhance, their, analytics, process, and, make, better, informed, decisions, thanks, to, big, data, artificial, intelligence, computer, vision, and, the, internet, of, things, the, use, of, data, by, retailers, is, mostly, evident, in, the, following,
