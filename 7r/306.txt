in, linguistics, and, grammar, a, pronoun, glossed, pro, is, a, word, or, a, group, of, words, that, one, may, substitute, for, a, noun, or, noun, phrase, pronouns, have, traditionally, been, regarded, as, one, of, the, parts, of, speech, but, some, modern, theorists, would, not, consider, them, to, form, a, single, class, in, view, of, the, variety, of, functions, they, perform, cross, linguistically, an, example, of, a, pronoun, is, you, which, can, be, either, singular, or, plural, sub, types, include, personal, and, possessive, pronouns, reflexive, and, reciprocal, pronouns, demonstrative, pronouns, relative, and, interrogative, pronouns, and, indefinite, pronouns, 1, 34, the, use, of, pronouns, often, involves, anaphora, where, the, meaning, of, the, pronoun, is, dependent, on, an, antecedent, for, example, in, the, sentence, that, poor, man, looks, as, if, he, needs, a, new, coat, the, meaning, of, the, pronoun, he, is, dependent, on, its, antecedent, that, poor, man, the, adjective, form, of, the, word, pronoun, is, pronominal, a, pronominal, is, also, a, word, or, phrase, that, acts, as, a, pronoun, for, example, in, that, s, not, the, one, i, wanted, the, phrase, the, one, containing, the, prop, word, one, is, a, pronominal, pronoun, is, a, category, of, words, a, pro, form, is, a, type, of, function, word, or, expression, that, stands, in, for, expresses, the, same, content, as, another, word, phrase, clause, or, sentence, where, the, meaning, is, recoverable, from, the, context, in, english, pronouns, mostly, function, as, pro, forms, but, there, are, pronouns, that, are, not, pro, forms, and, pro, forms, that, are, not, pronouns, examples, are, pronouns, and, pro, forms, in, the, pronoun, it, stands, in, for, whatever, was, mentioned, and, is, a, good, idea, in, the, relative, pronoun, who, stands, in, for, the, people, examples, are, pronouns, but, not, pro, forms, in, the, interrogative, pronoun, who, does, not, stand, in, for, anything, similarly, in, it, is, a, dummy, pronoun, one, that, does, not, stand, in, for, anything, no, other, word, can, function, there, with, the, same, meaning, we, do, not, say, the, sky, is, raining, or, the, weather, is, raining, a, prop, word, is, a, word, with, little, or, no, semantic, content, used, where, grammar, dictates, a, certain, sentence, member, e, g, to, provide, a, support, on, which, to, hang, a, modifier, the, word, most, commonly, considered, as, a, prop, word, in, english, is, one, with, the, plural, form, ones, the, prop, word, one, takes, the, place, of, a, countable, noun, in, a, noun, phrase, or, determiner, phrase, normally, in, a, context, where, it, is, clear, which, noun, it, is, replacing, for, example, in, a, context, in, which, hats, are, being, talked, about, the, red, one, means, the, red, hat, and, the, ones, we, bought, means, the, hats, we, bought, the, prop, word, thus, functions, somewhat, similarly, to, a, pronoun, except, that, a, pronoun, usually, takes, the, place, of, a, whole, noun, determiner, phrase, for, example, the, red, hat, may, be, replaced, by, the, pronoun, it, finally, in, there, are, pro, forms, that, are, not, pronouns, in, did, so, is, a, verb, phrase, that, stands, in, for, helped, inflected, from, to, help, stated, earlier, in, the, sentence, similarly, in, others, is, a, common, noun, not, a, pronoun, but, the, others, probably, stands, in, for, the, names, of, other, people, involved, e, g, sho, alana, and, ali, all, proper, nouns, pronouns, ant, nym, a, are, listed, as, one, of, eight, parts, of, speech, in, the, art, of, grammar, a, treatise, on, greek, grammar, attributed, to, dionysius, thrax, and, dating, from, the, 2nd, century, bc, the, pronoun, is, described, there, as, a, part, of, speech, substitutable, for, a, noun, and, marked, for, a, person, pronouns, continued, to, be, regarded, as, a, part, of, speech, in, latin, grammar, the, latin, term, being, pronomen, from, which, the, english, name, through, middle, french, ultimately, derives, and, thus, in, the, european, tradition, generally, because, of, the, many, different, syntactic, roles, that, they, play, pronouns, are, less, likely, to, be, a, single, word, class, in, more, modern, approaches, to, grammar, linguists, in, particular, have, trouble, classifying, pronouns, in, a, single, category, and, some, do, not, agree, that, pronouns, substitute, nouns, or, noun, categories, certain, types, of, pronouns, are, often, identical, or, similar, in, form, to, determiners, with, related, meaning, some, english, examples, are, given, in, the, table, this, observation, has, led, some, linguists, such, as, paul, postal, to, regard, pronouns, as, determiners, that, have, had, their, following, noun, or, noun, phrase, deleted, such, patterning, can, even, be, claimed, for, certain, personal, pronouns, for, example, we, and, you, might, be, analyzed, as, determiners, in, phrases, like, we, brits, and, you, tennis, players, other, linguists, have, taken, a, similar, view, uniting, pronouns, and, determiners, into, a, single, class, sometimes, called, determiner, pronoun, or, regarding, determiners, as, a, subclass, of, pronouns, or, vice, versa, the, distinction, may, be, considered, to, be, one, of, subcategorization, or, valency, rather, like, the, distinction, between, transitive, and, intransitive, verbs, determiners, take, a, noun, phrase, complement, like, transitive, verbs, do, while, pronouns, do, not, this, is, consistent, with, the, determiner, phrase, viewpoint, whereby, a, determiner, rather, than, the, noun, that, follows, it, is, taken, to, be, the, head, of, the, phrase, cross, linguistically, it, seems, as, though, pronouns, share, 3, distinct, categories, point, of, view, person, and, number, the, breadth, of, each, subcategory, however, tends, to, differ, among, languages, the, use, of, pronouns, often, involves, anaphora, where, the, meaning, of, the, pronoun, is, dependent, on, another, referential, element, the, referent, of, the, pronoun, is, often, the, same, as, that, of, a, preceding, or, sometimes, following, noun, phrase, called, the, antecedent, of, the, pronoun, the, grammatical, behavior, of, certain, types, of, pronouns, and, in, particular, their, possible, relationship, with, their, antecedents, has, been, the, focus, of, studies, in, binding, notably, in, the, chomskyan, government, and, binding, theory, in, this, binding, context, reflexive, and, reciprocal, pronouns, in, english, such, as, himself, and, each, other, are, referred, to, as, anaphors, in, a, specialized, restricted, sense, rather, than, as, pronominal, elements, under, binding, theory, specific, principles, apply, to, different, sets, of, pronouns, in, english, reflexive, and, reciprocal, pronouns, must, adhere, to, principle, a, an, anaphor, reflexive, or, reciprocal, such, as, each, other, must, be, bound, in, its, governing, category, roughly, the, clause, therefore, in, syntactic, structure, it, must, be, lower, in, structure, it, must, have, an, antecedent, and, have, a, direct, relationship, with, its, referent, this, is, called, a, c, command, relationship, for, instance, we, see, that, john, cut, himself, is, grammatical, but, himself, cut, john, is, not, despite, having, identical, arguments, since, himself, the, reflexive, must, be, lower, in, structure, to, john, its, referent, additionally, we, see, examples, like, john, said, that, mary, cut, himself, are, not, grammatical, because, there, is, an, intermediary, noun, mary, that, disallows, the, two, referents, from, having, a, direct, relationship, on, the, other, hand, personal, pronouns, such, as, him, or, them, must, adhere, to, principle, b, a, pronoun, must, be, free, i, e, not, bound, within, its, governing, category, roughly, the, clause, this, means, that, although, the, pronouns, can, have, a, referent, they, cannot, have, a, direct, relationship, with, the, referent, where, the, referent, selects, the, pronoun, for, instance, john, said, mary, cut, him, is, grammatical, because, the, two, co, referents, john, and, him, are, separated, structurally, by, mary, this, is, why, a, sentence, like, john, cut, him, where, him, refers, to, john, is, ungrammatical, the, type, of, binding, that, applies, to, subsets, of, pronouns, varies, cross, linguistically, for, instance, in, german, linguistics, pronouns, can, be, split, into, two, distinct, categories, personal, pronouns, and, d, pronouns, although, personal, pronouns, act, identically, to, english, personal, pronouns, i, e, follow, principle, b, d, pronouns, follow, yet, another, principle, principle, c, and, function, similarly, to, nouns, in, that, they, cannot, have, a, direct, relationship, to, an, antecedent, the, following, sentences, give, examples, of, particular, types, of, pronouns, used, with, antecedents, some, other, types, such, as, indefinite, pronouns, are, usually, used, without, antecedents, relative, pronouns, are, used, without, antecedents, in, free, relative, clauses, even, third, person, personal, pronouns, are, sometimes, used, without, antecedents, unprecursed, this, applies, to, special, uses, such, as, dummy, pronouns, and, generic, they, as, well, as, cases, where, the, referent, is, implied, by, the, context, english, personal, pronouns, have, a, number, of, different, syntactic, contexts, subject, object, possessive, reflexive, and, many, features, english, also, has, other, pronoun, types, including, demonstrative, relative, indefinite, and, interrogative, pronouns, personal, pronouns, may, be, classified, by, person, number, gender, and, case, english, has, three, persons, first, second, and, third, and, two, numbers, singular, and, plural, in, the, third, person, singular, there, are, also, distinct, pronoun, forms, for, male, female, and, neuter, gender, 52, 53, principal, forms, are, shown, in, the, adjacent, table, english, personal, pronouns, have, two, cases, subject, and, object, subject, pronouns, are, used, in, subject, position, i, like, to, eat, chips, but, she, does, not, object, pronouns, are, used, for, the, object, of, a, verb, or, preposition, john, likes, me, but, not, her, 52, 53, other, distinct, forms, found, in, some, languages, include, possessive, pronouns, are, used, to, indicate, possession, in, a, broad, sense, some, occur, as, independent, noun, phrases, mine, yours, hers, ours, theirs, an, example, is, those, clothes, are, mine, others, act, as, a, determiner, and, must, accompany, a, noun, my, your, her, our, your, their, as, in, i, lost, my, wallet, his, and, its, can, fall, into, either, category, although, its, is, nearly, always, found, in, the, second, those, of, the, second, type, have, traditionally, also, been, described, as, possessive, adjectives, and, in, more, modern, terminology, as, possessive, determiners, the, term, possessive, pronoun, is, sometimes, restricted, to, the, first, type, both, types, replace, possessive, noun, phrases, as, an, example, their, crusade, to, capture, our, attention, could, replace, the, advertisers, crusade, to, capture, our, attention, 55, 56, reflexive, pronouns, are, used, when, a, person, or, thing, acts, on, itself, for, example, john, cut, himself, in, english, they, all, end, in, self, or, selves, and, must, refer, to, a, noun, phrase, elsewhere, in, the, same, clause, 55, reciprocal, pronouns, refer, to, a, reciprocal, relationship, each, other, one, another, they, must, refer, to, a, noun, phrase, in, the, same, clause, 55, an, example, in, english, is, they, do, not, like, each, other, in, some, languages, the, same, forms, can, be, used, as, both, reflexive, and, reciprocal, pronouns, demonstrative, pronouns, in, english, this, that, and, their, plurals, these, those, often, distinguish, their, targets, by, pointing, or, some, other, indication, of, position, for, example, i, ll, take, these, they, may, also, be, anaphoric, depending, on, an, earlier, expression, for, context, for, example, a, kid, actor, would, try, to, be, all, sweet, and, who, needs, that, 56, indefinite, pronouns, the, largest, group, of, pronouns, refer, to, one, or, more, unspecified, persons, or, things, one, group, in, english, includes, compounds, of, some, any, every, and, no, with, thing, one, and, body, for, example, anyone, can, do, that, another, group, including, many, more, both, and, most, can, appear, alone, or, followed, by, of, 54, 55, in, addition, relative, pronouns, in, english, include, who, whom, whose, what, which, and, that, they, rely, on, an, antecedent, and, refer, back, to, people, or, things, previously, mentioned, people, who, smoke, should, quit, now, they, are, used, in, relative, clauses, 56, relative, pronouns, can, also, be, used, as, complementizers, relative, pronouns, can, be, used, in, an, interrogative, setting, as, interrogative, pronouns, interrogative, pronouns, ask, which, person, or, thing, is, meant, in, reference, to, a, person, one, may, use, who, subject, whom, object, or, whose, possessive, for, example, who, did, that, in, colloquial, speech, whom, is, generally, replaced, by, who, english, non, personal, interrogative, pronouns, which, and, what, have, only, one, form, 56, 57, in, english, and, many, other, languages, e, g, french, and, czech, the, sets, of, relative, and, interrogative, pronouns, are, nearly, identical, compare, english, who, is, that, interrogative, and, i, know, the, woman, who, came, relative, in, some, other, languages, interrogative, pronouns, and, indefinite, pronouns, are, frequently, identical, for, example, standard, chinese, sh, nme, means, what, as, well, as, something, or, anything, though, the, personal, pronouns, described, above, are, the, current, english, pronouns, early, modern, english, as, used, by, shakespeare, for, example, use, a, slightly, different, set, of, personal, pronouns, shown, in, the, table, the, difference, is, entirely, in, the, second, person, though, one, would, rarely, find, these, older, forms, used, in, recent, literature, they, are, nevertheless, considered, part, of, modern, english, in, english, kin, terms, like, mother, uncle, cousin, are, a, distinct, word, class, from, pronouns, however, many, australian, aboriginal, languages, have, more, elaborated, systems, of, encoding, kinship, in, language, including, special, kin, forms, of, pronouns, in, murrinh, patha, for, example, when, selecting, a, nonsingular, exclusive, pronoun, to, refer, to, a, group, the, speaker, will, assess, whether, or, not, the, members, of, the, group, belong, to, a, common, class, of, gender, or, kinship, if, all, of, the, members, of, the, referent, group, are, male, the, masculine, form, will, be, selected, if, at, least, one, is, female, the, feminine, is, selected, but, if, all, the, members, are, in, a, sibling, like, kinship, relation, a, third, sibling, form, is, selected, in, arabana, wangkangurru, the, speaker, will, use, entirely, different, sets, of, pronouns, depending, on, whether, the, speaker, and, the, referent, are, or, are, not, in, a, common, moiety, see, the, following, example, pulalakiya, 3du, kin, panti, rda, fight, pres, pulalakiya, panti, rda, 3du, kin, fight, pres, they, two, are, fighting, the, people, involved, were, a, man, and, his, wife, s, sister, s, son, see, australian, aboriginal, kinship, for, more, details, some, special, uses, of, personal, pronouns, include
