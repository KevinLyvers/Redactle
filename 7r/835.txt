liberty, is, the, state, of, being, free, within, society, from, oppressive, restrictions, imposed, by, authority, on, one, s, way, of, life, behavior, or, political, views, the, concept, of, liberty, can, vary, depending, on, perspective, and, context, in, the, constitutional, law, of, the, united, states, ordered, liberty, means, creating, a, balanced, society, where, individuals, have, the, freedom, to, act, without, unnecessary, interference, negative, liberty, and, access, to, opportunities, and, resources, to, pursue, their, goals, positive, liberty, all, within, a, fair, legal, system, sometimes, liberty, is, differentiated, from, freedom, by, using, the, word, freedom, primarily, if, not, exclusively, to, mean, the, ability, to, do, as, one, wills, and, what, one, has, the, power, to, do, and, using, the, word, liberty, to, mean, the, absence, of, arbitrary, restraints, taking, into, account, the, rights, of, all, involved, in, this, sense, the, exercise, of, liberty, is, subject, to, capability, and, limited, by, the, rights, of, others, thus, liberty, entails, the, responsible, use, of, freedom, under, the, rule, of, law, without, depriving, anyone, else, of, their, freedom, liberty, can, be, taken, away, as, a, form, of, punishment, in, many, countries, people, can, be, deprived, of, their, liberty, if, they, are, convicted, of, criminal, acts, liberty, originates, from, the, latin, word, liber, from, proto, italic, lou, eros, from, proto, indo, european, h, l, wd, eros, from, h, lewd, people, the, word, liberty, is, commonly, used, in, slogans, or, quotes, such, as, in, life, liberty, and, the, pursuit, of, happiness, and, libert, galit, fraternit, philosophers, from, the, earliest, times, have, considered, the, question, of, liberty, roman, emperor, marcus, aurelius, 121, 180, ad, wrote, a, polity, in, which, there, is, the, same, law, for, all, a, polity, administered, with, regard, to, equal, rights, and, equal, freedom, of, speech, and, the, idea, of, a, kingly, government, which, respects, most, of, all, the, freedom, of, the, governed, according, to, compatibilist, thomas, hobbes, 1588, 1679, a, free, man, is, he, that, in, those, things, which, by, his, strength, and, wit, he, is, able, to, do, is, not, hindered, to, do, what, he, hath, the, will, to, do, john, locke, 1632, 1704, rejected, that, definition, of, liberty, while, not, specifically, mentioning, hobbes, he, attacks, sir, robert, filmer, who, had, the, same, definition, according, to, locke, in, the, state, of, nature, liberty, consists, of, being, free, from, any, superior, power, on, earth, people, are, not, under, the, will, or, lawmaking, authority, of, others, but, have, only, the, law, of, nature, for, their, rule, in, political, society, liberty, consists, of, being, under, no, other, lawmaking, power, except, that, established, by, consent, in, the, commonwealth, people, are, free, from, the, dominion, of, any, will, or, legal, restraint, apart, from, that, enacted, by, their, own, constituted, lawmaking, power, according, to, the, trust, put, in, it, thus, freedom, is, not, as, sir, robert, filmer, defines, it, a, liberty, for, everyone, to, do, what, he, likes, to, live, as, he, pleases, and, not, to, be, tied, by, any, laws, freedom, is, constrained, by, laws, in, both, the, state, of, nature, and, political, society, freedom, of, nature, is, to, be, under, no, other, restraint, but, the, law, of, nature, freedom, of, people, under, government, is, to, be, under, no, restraint, apart, from, standing, rules, to, live, by, that, are, common, to, everyone, in, the, society, and, made, by, the, lawmaking, power, established, in, it, persons, have, a, right, or, liberty, to, 1, follow, their, own, will, in, all, things, that, the, law, has, not, prohibited, and, 2, not, be, subject, to, the, inconstant, uncertain, unknown, and, arbitrary, wills, of, others, john, stuart, mill, in, his, 1859, work, on, liberty, was, the, first, to, recognize, the, difference, between, liberty, as, the, freedom, to, act, and, liberty, as, the, absence, of, coercion, in, his, 1958, lecture, two, concepts, of, liberty, isaiah, berlin, formally, framed, the, differences, between, two, perspectives, as, the, distinction, between, two, opposite, concepts, of, liberty, positive, liberty, and, negative, liberty, the, latter, designates, a, negative, condition, in, which, an, individual, is, protected, from, tyranny, and, the, arbitrary, exercise, of, authority, while, the, former, refers, to, the, liberty, that, comes, from, self, mastery, the, freedom, from, inner, compulsions, such, as, weakness, and, fear, the, modern, day, concept, of, political, liberty, has, its, origins, in, the, greek, concepts, of, freedom, and, slavery, to, be, free, to, the, greeks, was, not, to, have, a, master, to, be, independent, from, a, master, to, live, as, one, likes, that, was, the, original, greek, concept, of, freedom, it, is, closely, linked, with, the, concept, of, democracy, as, aristotle, put, it, this, applied, only, to, free, men, in, athens, for, instance, women, could, not, vote, or, hold, office, and, were, legally, and, socially, dependent, on, a, male, relative, the, populations, of, the, persian, empire, enjoyed, some, degree, of, freedom, citizens, of, all, religions, and, ethnic, groups, were, given, the, same, rights, and, had, the, same, freedom, of, religion, women, had, the, same, rights, as, men, and, slavery, was, abolished, 550, bc, all, the, palaces, of, the, kings, of, persia, were, built, by, paid, workers, in, an, era, when, slaves, typically, did, such, work, in, the, maurya, empire, of, ancient, india, citizens, of, all, religions, and, ethnic, groups, had, some, rights, to, freedom, tolerance, and, equality, the, need, for, tolerance, on, an, egalitarian, basis, can, be, found, in, the, edicts, of, ashoka, the, great, which, emphasize, the, importance, of, tolerance, in, public, policy, by, the, government, the, slaughter, or, capture, of, prisoners, of, war, also, appears, to, have, been, condemned, by, ashoka, slavery, also, appears, to, have, been, non, existent, in, the, maurya, empire, however, according, to, hermann, kulke, and, dietmar, rothermund, ashoka, s, orders, seem, to, have, been, resisted, right, from, the, beginning, roman, law, also, embraced, certain, limited, forms, of, liberty, even, under, the, rule, of, the, roman, emperors, however, these, liberties, were, accorded, only, to, roman, citizens, many, of, the, liberties, enjoyed, under, roman, law, endured, through, the, middle, ages, but, were, enjoyed, solely, by, the, nobility, rarely, by, the, common, man, the, idea, of, inalienable, and, universal, liberties, had, to, wait, until, the, age, of, enlightenment, the, social, contract, theory, most, influentially, formulated, by, hobbes, john, locke, and, rousseau, though, first, suggested, by, plato, in, the, republic, was, among, the, first, to, provide, a, political, classification, of, rights, in, particular, through, the, notion, of, sovereignty, and, of, natural, rights, the, thinkers, of, the, enlightenment, reasoned, that, law, governed, both, heavenly, and, human, affairs, and, that, law, gave, the, king, his, power, rather, than, the, king, s, power, giving, force, to, law, this, conception, of, law, would, find, its, culmination, in, the, ideas, of, montesquieu, the, conception, of, law, as, a, relationship, between, individuals, rather, than, families, came, to, the, fore, and, with, it, the, increasing, focus, on, individual, liberty, as, a, fundamental, reality, given, by, nature, and, nature, s, god, which, in, the, ideal, state, would, be, as, universal, as, possible, in, on, liberty, john, stuart, mill, sought, to, define, the, nature, and, limits, of, the, power, which, can, be, legitimately, exercised, by, society, over, the, individual, and, as, such, he, describes, an, inherent, and, continuous, antagonism, between, liberty, and, authority, and, thus, the, prevailing, question, becomes, how, to, make, the, fitting, adjustment, between, individual, independence, and, social, control, timeline, according, to, the, 1776, united, states, declaration, of, independence, all, people, have, a, natural, right, to, life, liberty, and, the, pursuit, of, happiness, this, declaration, of, liberty, was, troubled, for, 90, years, by, the, continued, institutionalization, of, legalized, black, slavery, as, slave, owners, argued, that, their, liberty, was, paramount, since, it, involved, property, their, slaves, and, that, blacks, had, no, rights, that, any, white, man, was, obliged, to, recognize, the, supreme, court, in, the, 1857, dred, scott, decision, upheld, this, principle, in, 1866, after, the, american, civil, war, the, us, constitution, was, amended, to, extend, rights, to, persons, of, color, and, in, 1920, voting, rights, were, extended, to, women, by, the, later, half, of, the, 20th, century, liberty, was, expanded, further, to, prohibit, government, interference, with, personal, choices, in, the, 1965, united, states, supreme, court, decision, griswold, v, connecticut, justice, william, o, douglas, argued, that, liberties, relating, to, personal, relationships, such, as, marriage, have, a, unique, primacy, of, place, in, the, hierarchy, of, freedoms, jacob, m, appel, has, summarized, this, principle, i, am, grateful, that, i, have, rights, in, the, proverbial, public, square, but, as, a, practical, matter, my, most, cherished, rights, are, those, that, i, possess, in, my, bedroom, and, hospital, room, and, death, chamber, most, people, are, far, more, concerned, that, they, can, control, their, own, bodies, than, they, are, about, petitioning, congress, in, modern, america, various, competing, ideologies, have, divergent, views, about, how, best, to, promote, liberty, liberals, in, the, original, sense, of, the, word, see, equality, as, a, necessary, component, of, freedom, progressives, stress, freedom, from, business, monopoly, as, essential, libertarians, disagree, and, see, economic, and, individual, freedom, as, best, the, tea, party, movement, sees, big, government, as, an, enemy, of, freedom, other, major, participants, in, the, modern, american, libertarian, movement, include, the, libertarian, party, the, free, state, project, and, the, mises, institute, france, supported, the, americans, in, their, revolt, against, english, rule, and, in, 1789, overthrew, their, own, monarchy, with, the, cry, of, libert, galit, fraternit, the, bloodbath, that, followed, known, as, the, reign, of, terror, soured, many, people, on, the, idea, of, liberty, edmund, burke, considered, one, of, the, fathers, of, conservatism, wrote, the, french, had, shewn, themselves, the, ablest, architects, of, ruin, that, had, hitherto, existed, in, the, world, according, to, the, concise, oxford, dictionary, of, politics, liberalism, is, the, belief, that, it, is, the, aim, of, politics, to, preserve, individual, rights, and, to, maximize, freedom, of, choice, but, they, point, out, that, there, is, considerable, discussion, about, how, to, achieve, those, goals, every, discussion, of, freedom, depends, on, three, key, components, who, is, free, what, they, are, free, to, do, and, what, forces, restrict, their, freedom, john, gray, argues, that, the, core, belief, of, liberalism, is, toleration, liberals, allow, others, freedom, to, do, what, they, want, in, exchange, for, having, the, same, freedom, in, return, this, idea, of, freedom, is, personal, rather, than, political, william, safire, points, out, that, liberalism, is, attacked, by, both, the, right, and, the, left, by, the, right, for, defending, such, practices, as, abortion, homosexuality, and, atheism, and, by, the, left, for, defending, free, enterprise, and, the, rights, of, the, individual, over, the, collective, according, to, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, libertarians, hold, liberty, as, their, primary, political, value, their, approach, to, implementing, liberty, involves, opposing, any, governmental, coercion, aside, from, that, which, is, necessary, to, prevent, individuals, from, coercing, each, other, libertarianism, is, guided, by, the, principle, commonly, known, as, the, non, aggression, principle, nap, the, non, aggression, principle, asserts, that, aggression, against, an, individual, or, an, individual, s, property, is, always, an, immoral, violation, of, one, s, life, liberty, and, property, rights, utilizing, deceit, instead, of, consent, to, achieve, ends, is, also, a, violation, of, the, non, aggression, principle, therefore, under, the, framework, of, the, non, aggression, principle, rape, murder, deception, involuntary, taxation, government, regulation, and, other, behaviors, that, initiate, aggression, against, otherwise, peaceful, individuals, are, considered, violations, of, this, principle, this, principle, is, most, commonly, adhered, to, by, libertarians, a, common, elevator, pitch, for, this, principle, is, good, ideas, don, t, require, force, according, to, republican, theorists, of, freedom, like, the, historian, quentin, skinner, or, the, philosopher, philip, pettit, one, s, liberty, should, not, be, viewed, as, the, absence, of, interference, in, one, s, actions, but, as, non, domination, according, to, this, view, which, originates, in, the, roman, digest, to, be, a, liber, homo, a, free, man, means, not, being, subject, to, another, s, arbitrary, will, that, is, to, say, dominated, by, another, they, also, cite, machiavelli, who, asserted, that, you, must, be, a, member, of, a, free, self, governing, civil, association, a, republic, if, you, are, to, enjoy, individual, liberty, the, predominance, of, this, view, of, liberty, among, parliamentarians, during, the, english, civil, war, resulted, in, the, creation, of, the, liberal, concept, of, freedom, as, non, interference, in, thomas, hobbes, leviathan, socialists, view, freedom, as, a, concrete, situation, as, opposed, to, a, purely, abstract, ideal, freedom, is, a, state, of, being, where, individuals, have, agency, to, pursue, their, creative, interests, unhindered, by, coercive, social, relationships, specifically, those, they, are, forced, to, engage, in, as, a, requisite, for, survival, under, a, given, social, system, freedom, thus, requires, both, the, material, economic, conditions, that, make, freedom, possible, alongside, social, relationships, and, institutions, conducive, to, freedom, the, socialist, conception, of, freedom, is, closely, related, to, the, socialist, view, of, creativity, and, individuality, influenced, by, karl, marx, s, concept, of, alienated, labor, socialists, understand, freedom, to, be, the, ability, for, an, individual, to, engage, in, creative, work, in, the, absence, of, alienation, where, alienated, labor, refers, to, work, people, are, forced, to, perform, and, un, alienated, work, refers, to, individuals, pursuing, their, own, creative, interests, for, karl, marx, meaningful, freedom, is, only, attainable, in, a, communist, society, characterized, by, superabundance, and, free, access, such, a, social, arrangement, would, eliminate, the, need, for, alienated, labor, and, enable, individuals, to, pursue, their, own, creative, interests, leaving, them, to, develop, and, maximize, their, full, potentialities, this, goes, alongside, marx, s, emphasis, on, the, ability, of, socialism, and, communism, progressively, reducing, the, average, length, of, the, workday, to, expand, the, realm, of, freedom, or, discretionary, free, time, for, each, person, marx, s, notion, of, communist, society, and, human, freedom, is, thus, radically, individualistic, while, many, anarchists, see, freedom, slightly, differently, all, oppose, authority, including, the, authority, of, the, state, of, capitalism, and, of, nationalism, for, the, russian, revolutionary, anarchist, mikhail, bakunin, liberty, did, not, mean, an, abstract, ideal, but, a, concrete, reality, based, on, the, equal, liberty, of, others, in, a, positive, sense, liberty, consists, of, the, fullest, development, of, all, the, faculties, and, powers, of, every, human, being, by, education, by, scientific, training, and, by, material, prosperity, such, a, conception, of, liberty, is, eminently, social, because, it, can, only, be, realized, in, society, not, in, isolation, in, a, negative, sense, liberty, is, the, revolt, of, the, individual, against, all, divine, collective, and, individual, authority, this, also, is, remarkable, in, india, that, all, indians, are, free, and, no, indian, at, all, is, a, slave, in, this, the, indians, agree, with, the, lacedaemonians, yet, the, lacedaemonians, have, helots, for, slaves, who, perform, the, duties, of, slaves, but, the, indians, have, no, slaves, at, all, much, less, is, any, indian, a, slave
