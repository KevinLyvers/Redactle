in, linguistics, diglossia, d, a, l, s, i, dy, gloss, ee, us, also, d, a, l, s, i, dy, glaw, see, is, a, situation, in, which, two, dialects, or, languages, are, used, in, fairly, strict, compartmentalization, by, a, single, language, community, in, addition, to, the, community, s, everyday, or, vernacular, language, variety, labeled, l, or, low, variety, a, second, highly, codified, lect, labeled, h, or, high, is, used, in, certain, situations, such, as, literature, formal, education, or, other, specific, settings, but, not, used, normally, for, ordinary, conversation, the, h, variety, may, have, no, native, speakers, within, the, community, in, cases, of, three, dialects, the, term, triglossia, is, used, when, referring, to, two, writing, systems, coexisting, for, a, single, language, the, term, digraphia, is, used, the, high, variety, may, be, an, older, stage, of, the, same, language, as, in, medieval, europe, where, latin, h, remained, in, formal, use, even, as, colloquial, speech, l, diverged, an, unrelated, language, or, a, distinct, yet, closely, related, present, day, dialect, as, in, northern, india, and, pakistan, where, hindustani, l, is, used, alongside, the, standard, registers, of, hindi, h, and, urdu, h, hochdeutsch, h, is, used, alongside, german, dialects, l, the, arab, world, where, modern, standard, arabic, h, is, used, alongside, other, varieties, of, arabic, l, and, china, where, standard, chinese, h, is, used, as, the, official, literary, standard, and, local, varieties, of, chinese, l, are, used, in, everyday, communication, other, examples, include, literary, katharevousa, h, versus, spoken, demotic, greek, l, literary, tamil, h, versus, colloquial, spoken, tamil, l, indonesian, with, its, bahasa, baku, h, and, bahasa, gaul, l, forms, standard, american, english, h, versus, african, american, vernacular, english, or, hawaiian, pidgin, l, and, literary, h, versus, spoken, l, welsh, the, greek, word, digloss, a, from, d, two, and, gl, ssa, language, meant, bilingualism, it, was, given, its, specialized, meaning, two, forms, of, the, same, language, by, emmanuel, rhoides, in, the, prologue, of, his, parerga, in, 1885, the, term, was, quickly, adapted, into, french, as, diglossie, by, the, greek, linguist, and, demoticist, ioannis, psycharis, with, credit, to, rhoides, the, arabist, william, mar, ais, used, the, term, in, 1930, to, describe, the, linguistic, situation, in, arabic, speaking, countries, the, sociolinguist, charles, a, ferguson, introduced, the, english, equivalent, diglossia, in, 1959, in, the, title, of, an, article, his, conceptualization, of, diglossia, describes, a, society, with, more, than, one, prevalent, language, or, the, high, variety, which, pertains, to, the, language, used, in, literature, newspapers, and, other, social, institutions, the, article, has, been, cited, over, 4, 000, times, the, term, is, particularly, embraced, among, sociolinguists, and, a, number, of, these, proposed, different, interpretations, or, varieties, of, the, concept, in, his, 1959, article, charles, a, ferguson, defines, diglossia, as, follows, diglossia, is, a, relatively, stable, language, situation, in, which, in, addition, to, the, primary, dialects, of, the, language, which, may, include, a, standard, or, regional, standards, there, is, a, very, divergent, highly, codified, often, grammatically, more, complex, superposed, variety, the, vehicle, of, a, large, and, respected, body, of, written, literature, either, of, an, earlier, period, or, in, another, speech, community, which, is, learned, largely, by, formal, education, and, is, used, for, most, written, and, formal, spoken, purposes, but, is, not, used, by, any, sector, of, the, community, for, ordinary, conversation, here, diglossia, is, seen, as, a, kind, of, bilingualism, in, a, society, in, which, one, of, the, languages, has, high, prestige, henceforth, referred, to, as, h, and, another, of, the, languages, has, low, prestige, l, in, ferguson, s, definition, the, high, and, low, variants, are, always, closely, related, ferguson, gives, the, example, of, standardized, arabic, and, says, that, very, often, educated, arabs, will, maintain, they, never, use, l, at, all, in, spite, of, the, fact, that, direct, observation, shows, that, they, use, it, constantly, in, ordinary, conversation, joshua, fishman, expanded, the, definition, of, diglossia, to, include, the, use, of, unrelated, languages, as, high, and, low, varieties, for, example, in, alsace, the, alsatian, language, els, ssisch, serves, as, l, and, french, as, h, heinz, kloss, calls, the, h, variant, exoglossia, and, the, l, variant, endoglossia, in, some, cases, especially, with, creole, languages, the, nature, of, the, connection, between, h, and, l, is, not, one, of, diglossia, but, a, continuum, for, example, jamaican, creole, as, l, and, standard, english, as, h, in, jamaica, similar, is, the, case, in, the, scottish, lowlands, with, scots, as, l, and, scottish, english, as, h, h, is, usually, the, written, language, whereas, l, is, the, spoken, language, in, formal, situations, h, is, used, in, informal, situations, l, is, used, sometimes, h, is, used, in, informal, situations, and, as, spoken, language, when, speakers, of, 2, different, l, languages, and, dialects, or, more, communicate, with, each, other, as, a, lingua, franca, but, not, the, other, way, around, one, of, the, earliest, examples, was, that, of, middle, egyptian, the, language, in, everyday, use, in, ancient, egypt, during, the, middle, kingdom, 2000, 1650, bc, by, 1350, bc, in, the, new, kingdom, 1550, 1050, bc, the, egyptian, language, had, evolved, into, late, egyptian, which, itself, later, evolved, into, demotic, 700, bc, ad, 400, these, two, later, forms, served, as, l, languages, in, their, respective, periods, but, in, both, cases, middle, egyptian, remained, the, standard, written, prestigious, form, the, h, language, and, was, still, used, for, this, purpose, until, the, fourth, century, ad, more, than, sixteen, centuries, after, it, had, ceased, to, exist, in, everyday, speech, another, historical, example, is, latin, classical, latin, being, the, h, and, vulgar, latin, the, l, the, latter, which, is, almost, completely, unattested, in, text, is, the, tongue, from, which, the, romance, languages, descended, the, l, variants, are, not, just, simplifications, or, corruptions, of, the, h, variants, in, phonology, for, example, l, dialects, are, as, likely, to, have, phonemes, absent, from, the, h, as, vice, versa, some, swiss, german, dialects, have, three, phonemes, e, and, in, the, phonetic, space, where, standard, german, has, only, two, phonemes, berlin, berlin, b, ren, bears, and, e, beeren, berries, jamaican, creole, has, fewer, vowel, phonemes, than, standard, english, but, it, has, additional, palatal, k, and, phonemes, especially, in, endoglossia, the, l, form, may, also, be, called, basilect, the, h, form, acrolect, and, an, intermediate, form, mesolect, ferguson, s, classic, examples, include, standard, german, swiss, german, standard, arabic, arabic, vernaculars, french, creole, in, haiti, and, katharevousa, dimotiki, in, greece, though, the, low, prestige, nature, of, most, of, these, examples, has, changed, since, ferguson, s, article, was, published, creole, is, now, recognized, as, a, standard, language, in, haiti, swiss, german, dialects, are, hardly, low, prestige, languages, in, switzerland, see, chambers, sociolinguistic, theory, and, after, the, end, of, the, greek, military, regime, in, 1974, dimotiki, was, made, into, greece, s, sole, standard, language, in, 1976, and, nowadays, katharevousa, is, with, a, few, exceptions, no, longer, used, harold, schiffman, wrote, about, swiss, german, in, 2010, it, seems, to, be, the, case, that, swiss, german, was, once, consensually, agreed, to, be, in, a, diglossic, hierarchy, with, standard, german, but, that, this, consensus, is, now, breaking, code, switching, is, also, commonplace, especially, in, the, arabic, world, according, to, andrew, freeman, this, is, different, from, ferguson, s, description, of, diglossia, which, states, that, the, two, forms, are, in, complementary, distribution, to, a, certain, extent, there, is, code, switching, and, overlap, in, all, diglossic, societies, even, german, speaking, switzerland, examples, where, the, high, low, dichotomy, is, justified, in, terms, of, social, prestige, include, italian, dialects, and, languages, as, l, and, standard, italian, as, h, in, italy, and, german, dialects, and, standard, german, in, germany, in, italy, and, germany, those, speakers, who, still, speak, non, standard, dialects, typically, use, those, dialects, in, informal, situations, especially, in, the, family, in, german, speaking, switzerland, on, the, other, hand, swiss, german, dialects, are, to, a, certain, extent, even, used, in, schools, and, to, a, larger, extent, in, churches, ramseier, calls, german, speaking, switzerland, s, diglossia, a, medial, diglossia, whereas, felicity, rash, prefers, functional, diglossia, paradoxically, swiss, german, offers, both, the, best, example, of, diglossia, all, speakers, are, native, speakers, of, swiss, german, and, thus, diglossic, and, the, worst, because, there, is, no, clear, cut, hierarchy, while, swiss, standard, german, is, spoken, in, formal, situations, like, in, school, news, broadcasts, and, government, speeches, swiss, standard, german, is, also, spoken, in, informal, situations, only, whenever, a, german, swiss, is, communicating, with, a, german, speaking, foreigner, who, it, is, assumed, would, not, understand, the, respective, dialect, amongst, themselves, the, german, speaking, swiss, use, their, respective, swiss, german, dialect, irrespective, of, social, class, education, or, topic, in, most, african, countries, as, well, as, some, asian, ones, a, european, language, serves, as, the, official, prestige, language, and, local, languages, are, used, in, everyday, life, outside, formal, situations, for, example, wolof, is, the, everyday, lingua, franca, in, senegal, french, being, spoken, only, in, very, formal, situations, and, english, is, spoken, in, formal, situations, in, nigeria, but, native, languages, like, hausa, igbo, and, yoruba, are, spoken, in, ordinary, conversation, however, a, european, language, that, serves, as, an, official, language, can, also, act, as, a, lingua, franca, being, spoken, in, informal, situations, between, speakers, of, two, or, more, different, languages, to, facilitate, communication, diglossia, can, exist, between, two, dialects, of, a, european, language, as, well, for, example, in, c, te, d, ivoire, standard, french, is, the, prestige, language, used, in, business, politics, etc, while, ivorian, french, is, the, daily, language, in, the, street, on, the, markets, and, in, informal, situations, in, general, in, mozambique, european, portuguese, is, used, in, formal, situations, while, mozambican, portuguese, is, the, spoken, language, in, informal, situations, and, british, english, is, used, in, formal, situations, in, nigeria, while, nigerian, english, is, the, spoken, language, in, informal, situations, in, the, countryside, local, african, dialects, prevail, however, in, traditional, events, local, languages, can, be, used, as, prestige, dialects, for, example, a, wedding, ceremony, between, two, young, urban, baoul, people, with, poor, knowledge, of, the, baoul, language, spoken, in, c, te, d, ivoire, would, require, the, presence, of, elder, family, members, as, interpreters, to, conduct, the, ceremony, in, that, language, local, languages, if, used, as, prestige, languages, are, also, used, in, writing, materials, in, a, more, formal, type, of, vocabulary, there, are, also, european, languages, in, africa, particularly, north, africa, without, official, status, that, are, used, as, prestige, language, for, example, in, morocco, while, modern, standard, arabic, and, recently, tamazight, are, the, only, two, official, languages, used, in, formal, situations, with, moroccan, arabic, and, amazigh, dialects, spoken, in, informal, situations, while, french, and, spanish, are, also, spoken, in, formal, situations, making, some, moroccans, bilinguals, or, trilinguals, in, modern, standard, arabic, or, tamazight, french, or, spanish, and, moroccan, arabic, or, amazigh, dialects, in, sahrawi, arab, democratic, republic, the, official, languages, are, modern, standard, arabic, and, spanish, which, are, spoken, in, formal, situations, while, hassaniya, arabic, is, spoken, in, informal, situations, and, spanish, is, also, spoken, in, informal, situations, in, asia, the, philippines, is, the, biggest, example, of, such, colonial, exoglossia, with, english, since, the, spanish, american, war, of, 1898, spanish, before, then, with, a, historic, presence, in, place, names, personal, names, and, loanwords, in, the, local, languages, and, local, austronesian, philippine, languages, used, for, everyday, situations, timor, leste, is, in, a, similar, situation, with, portuguese, most, asian, countries, instead, have, re, established, a, local, prestige, language, such, as, hindi, or, indonesian, and, have, at, least, partially, phased, out, the, colonial, language, commonly, english, or, russian, but, also, dutch, french, and, portuguese, in, a, few, places, except, for, international, business, scientific, or, interethnic, communication, the, colonial, languages, have, also, usually, left, many, loanwards, in, the, local, languages, in, ghana, a, dialect, called, student, pidgin, was, traditionally, used, by, men, in, all, male, secondary, schools, though, an, ever, increasing, number, of, female, students, are, now, also, using, it, due, to, social, change, gender, based, oral, speech, variations, are, found, in, arabic, speaking, communities, makkan, males, are, found, to, adopt, more, formal, linguistic, variants, in, their, whatsapp, messages, than, their, female, counterparts, who, tend, to, use, more, informal, locally, prestigious, linguistic, variants, among, garifuna, karif, speakers, in, central, america, men, and, women, often, have, different, words, for, the, same, concepts, in, ireland, deaf, men, and, women, studied, in, two, separate, schools, throughout, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, lack, of, contact, between, the, two, groups, led, to, the, development, of, gender, specific, varieties, of, irish, sign, language, greek, diglossia, belongs, to, the, category, whereby, while, the, living, language, of, the, area, evolves, and, changes, as, time, passes, by, there, is, an, artificial, retrospection, to, and, imitation, of, earlier, more, ancient, linguistic, forms, preserved, in, writing, and, considered, to, be, scholarly, and, classic, one, of, the, earliest, recorded, examples, of, diglossia, was, during, the, first, century, ad, when, hellenistic, alexandrian, scholars, decided, that, in, order, to, strengthen, the, link, between, the, people, and, the, glorious, culture, of, the, greek, golden, age, 5th, c, bc, people, should, adopt, the, language, of, that, era, the, phenomenon, called, atticism, dominated, the, writings, of, part, of, the, hellenistic, period, the, byzantine, and, medieval, era, following, the, greek, war, of, independence, of, 1821, and, in, order, to, cover, new, and, immediate, needs, making, their, appearance, with, the, creation, of, the, greek, state, scholars, brought, to, life, katharevousa, or, purist, language, katharevousa, did, not, constitute, the, natural, development, of, the, language, of, the, people, the, koine, romeika, demotic, greek, or, dimotiki, as, it, is, currently, referred, to, it, constituted, an, attempt, to, purify, the, language, from, vulgar, forms, such, as, words, of, foreign, origin, especially, turkish, and, slavic, languages, but, also, french, or, italian, and, replace, them, with, ancient, attic, forms, and, even, by, reaching, down, to, homeric, cleansed, and, refined, words, diglossia, in, modern, serbian, language, is, the, most, obvious, if, we, consider, the, usage, of, past, tenses, in, high, and, low, varieties, the, high, variety, of, the, serbian, is, based, on, the, serbo, croatian, language, of, the, former, communist, yugoslavia, in, the, high, form, newspapers, television, other, mass, media, education, and, any, other, formal, use, or, situation, all, of, the, serbian, past, tenses, are, replaced, by, the, present, perfect, tense, which, is, in, the, serbian, school, system, either, called, perfect, tense, or, the, past, tense, but, never, present, perfect, since, ww2, on, the, other, side, the, low, form, informal, vernacular, language, contains, several, other, past, tenses, aorist, two, past, perfect, forms, and, rarely, imperfect, and, one, more, with, no, name, of, which, the, aorist, is, the, most, important, in, the, low, form, the, present, perfect, tense, with, perfective, verbs, is, not, strictly, treated, as, a, past, tense, in, many, rural, and, semi, rural, parts, of, serbia, the, aorist, despite, being, banished, from, any, formal, use, is, the, most, frequent, past, tense, form, in, the, spoken, informal, language, more, frequent, even, than, the, highly, prestigious, present, perfect, when, statements, of, peasants, need, to, be, written, down, by, authorities, or, published, in, any, form, the, past, tenses, are, usually, replaced, by, the, present, perfect, tense, the, high, form, of, serbian, today, does, have, native, speakers, those, are, usually, younger, and, more, educated, parts, of, the, population, living, in, big, cities, such, as, belgrade, the, capital, of, serbia, and, novi, sad, most, of, them, are, unable, to, differentiate, the, meanings, among, the, present, perfect, tense, and, the, other, past, tenses, which, they, do, not, use, due, to, the, influence, of, education, and, mass, media, diglossia, may, have, appeared, in, arabic, when, muslim, cities, emerged, during, the, early, period, of, islam, as, an, aspect, of, study, of, the, relationships, between, codes, and, social, structure, diglossia, is, an, important, concept, in, the, field, of, sociolinguistics, at, the, social, level, each, of, the, two, dialects, has, certain, spheres, of, social, interaction, assigned, to, it, and, in, the, assigned, spheres, it, is, the, only, socially, acceptable, dialect, with, minor, exceptions, at, the, grammatical, level, differences, may, involve, pronunciation, inflection, and, or, syntax, sentence, structure, differences, can, range, from, minor, although, conspicuous, to, extreme, in, many, cases, of, diglossia, the, two, dialects, are, so, divergent, that, they, are, distinct, languages, as, defined, by, linguists, they, are, not, mutually, intelligible, thomas, ricento, an, author, on, language, policy, and, political, theory, believes, that, there, is, always, a, socially, constructed, hierarchy, indexed, from, low, to, high, the, hierarchy, is, generally, imposed, by, leading, political, figures, or, popular, media, and, is, sometimes, not, the, native, language, of, that, particular, region, the, dialect, that, is, the, original, mother, tongue, is, almost, always, of, low, prestige, its, spheres, of, use, involve, informal, interpersonal, communication, conversation, in, the, home, among, friends, in, marketplaces, in, some, diglossias, this, vernacular, dialect, is, virtually, unwritten, those, who, try, to, use, it, in, literature, may, be, severely, criticized, or, even, persecuted, the, other, dialect, is, held, in, high, esteem, and, is, devoted, to, written, communication, and, formal, spoken, communication, such, as, university, instruction, primary, education, sermons, and, speeches, by, government, officials, it, is, usually, not, possible, to, acquire, proficiency, in, the, formal, high, dialect, without, formal, study, of, it, thus, in, those, diglossic, societies, which, are, also, characterized, by, extreme, inequality, of, social, classes, most, people, are, not, proficient, in, speaking, the, high, dialect, and, if, the, high, dialect, is, grammatically, different, enough, as, in, the, case, of, arabic, diglossia, these, uneducated, classes, cannot, understand, most, of, the, public, speeches, that, they, might, hear, on, television, and, radio, the, high, prestige, dialect, or, language, tends, to, be, the, more, formalised, and, its, forms, and, vocabulary, often, filter, down, into, the, vernacular, though, often, in, a, changed, form, in, many, diglossic, areas, there, is, controversy, and, polarization, of, opinions, of, native, speakers, regarding, the, relationship, between, the, two, dialects, and, their, respective, statuses, in, cases, that, the, high, dialect, is, objectively, not, intelligible, to, those, exposed, only, to, the, vernacular, some, people, insist, that, the, two, dialects, are, nevertheless, a, common, language, the, pioneering, scholar, of, diglossia, charles, a, ferguson, observed, that, native, speakers, proficient, in, the, high, prestige, dialect, will, commonly, try, to, avoid, using, the, vernacular, dialect, with, foreigners, and, may, even, deny, its, existence, even, though, the, vernacular, is, the, only, socially, appropriate, one, for, themselves, to, use, when, speaking, to, their, relatives, and, friends, yet, another, common, attitude, is, that, the, low, dialect, which, is, everyone, s, native, language, ought, to, be, abandoned, in, favor, of, the, high, dialect, which, presently, is, nobody, s, native, language
