were, paid, based, on, students, results, their, pupils, were, expected, to, achieve, precise, standards, in, reading, writing, and, arithmetic, such, as, reading, a, short, paragraph, in, a, newspaper, writing, from, dictation, and, working, out, sums, and, fractions, to, achieve, this, a, dual, education, system, was, initiated, consisting, of, both, voluntary, denominational, schools,

received, a, doctorate, in, 1918, and, did, post, doctoral, research, in, z, rich, and, paris, his, thoughts, developed, in, four, phases, using, this, framework, the, child, s, staged, development, can, be, examined, his, theory, included, four, stages, the, sensorimotor, period, the, pre, operational, period, the, concrete, operational, period, and, the, formal, operational, period, lev, vygotsky, s, theory, is, based, on, social, learning, where, a, more, knowledgeable, other, mko, helps, a, child, progress, within, their, zone, of, proximal, development, zpd, within, the, zpd, there, are, skills, that, the, child, could, do, but, needs, to, be, shown, to, move, from, yearning, to, independent, proficiency, the, assistance, or, instruction, becomes, a, form, of, instructional, scaffolding, this, term, and, idea, was, developed, by, jerome, bruner, david, wood, and, gail, ross, these, are, in, the, realms, of, the, the, united, nations, millennium, development, goal, 2, 2002, was, to, achieve, universal, primary, education, by, 2015, by, that, time, they, aimed, to, ensure, that, all, children, everywhere, regardless, of, race, or, gender, could, complete, primary, schooling, because, the, united, nations, specifically, focused, on, sub, saharan, africa, and, south, asia, as, they, are, both, home, to, the, vast, majority, of, children, out, of, school, they, hypothesized, that, they, might, not, have, been, able, to, reach, their, goal, by, 2015, according, to, the, september, 2010, fact, sheet, this, was, because, there, were, still, about, 69, million, school, age, children, who, were, not, in, school, with, almost, half, of, the, demographic, in, sub, saharan, africa, and, more, than, a, quarter, in, southern, asia, in, order, to, achieve, the, goal, by, 2015, the, united, nations, estimated, that, all, children, at, the, official, entry, age, for, primary, school, would, have, had, to, have, been, attending, classes, by, 2009, this, would, depend, upon, the, duration, of, the, primary, level, and, how, well, the, schools, retain, students, until, the, end, of, the, cycle, not, only, was, it, important, for, children, to, be, enrolled, in, education, but, countries, would, have, to, ensure, that, there, were, a, sufficient, number, of, teachers, and, classrooms, to, meet, the, demand, as, of, 2010, the, number, of, new, teachers, needed, in, sub, saharan, africa, alone, equaled, the, extant, teaching, force, in, the, region, the, gender, gap, for, children, not, in, education, narrowed, between, 1999, and, 2008, the, number, of, girls, not, in, education, worldwide, had, decreased, from, 57, percent, to, 53, percent, however, in, some, regions, the, percentage, had, increased, according, to, the, united, nations, many, things, in, the, regions, have, already, been, accomplished, although, enrollment, in, the, sub, saharan, area, of, africa, continues, to, be, the, lowest, region, worldwide, by, 2010, it, still, increased, by, 18, percentage, points, from, 58, percent, to, 76, percent, between, 1999, and, 2008, there, was, also, progress, in, southern, asia, and, north, africa, where, both, areas, saw, an, increase, in, enrollment, for, example, in, southern, asia, this, had, increased, by, 11, percent, and, in, north, africa, by, 8, percent, over, the, last, decade, major, advances, had, been, made, even, in, the, poorest, countries, like, the, abolition, of, primary, school, fees, in, burundi, where, there, was, an, increase, in, primary, school, enrollment, which, reached, 99, percent, as, of, 2008, also, tanzania, experienced, a, similar, outcome, the, country, doubled, its, enrollment, ratio, over, the, same, period, moreover, other, regions, in, latin, america, such, as, guatemala, and, nicaragua, and, zambia, in, southern, africa, broke, through, the, 90, percent, towards, greater, access, to, primary, education, schools, play, an, important, role, in, children, s, socialization, and, in, developing, their, appreciation, of, sharing, fairness, mutual, respect, and, cooperation, schools, form, the, foundational, values, and, competencies, that, are, the, building, blocks, towards, the, understanding, of, concepts, such, as, justice, democracy, and, human, rights, education, systems, that, promote, education, for, justice, that, is, respect, for, the, rule, of, law, rol, together, with, international, human, rights, and, fundamental, freedoms, strengthen, the, relationship, between, learners, and, public, institutions, to, empower, young, people, to, become, champions, of, peace, and, justice, teachers, are, often, on, the, front, line, of, this, work, and, along, with, families, play, a, formative, role, in, shaping, children, s, attitudes, and, behaviours, global, citizenship, education, provides, the, overall, framework, for, the, approach, to, the, rol, it, aims, to, empower, learners, to, engage, and, assume, active, roles, both, locally, and, globally, as, proactive, contributors, to, a, more, just, peaceful, tolerant, inclusive, secure, and, sustainable, world
