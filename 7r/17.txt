home, country, control, is, considered, an, important, aspect, of, an, mnc, to, distinguish, it, from, international, portfolio, investment, organizations, such, as, some, international, mutual, funds, that, invest, in, corporations, abroad, simply, to, diversify, financial, risks, black, s, law, dictionary, suggests, that, a, company, or, group, should, be, considered, a, multinational, corporation, if, it, derives, 25, or, more, of, its, revenue, from, out, of, home, country, operations, most, of, the, current, largest, and, most, influential, companies, are, publicly, traded, multinational, corporations, including, forbes, global, 2000, companies, the, history, of, multinational, corporations, began, with, the, history, of, colonialism, the, first, multinational, corporations, were, founded, to, set, up, colonial, factories, or, port, cities, in, addition, to, carrying, on, trade, between, the, mother, country, and, the, colonies, the, british, east, india, company, became, a, quasi, government, in, its, own, right, with, local, government, officials, and, its, own, army, in, india, the, two, main, examples, were, the, british, east, india, company, founded, in, 1600, and, the, dutch, east, india, company, voc, founded, in, 1602, others, included, the, swedish, africa, company, founded, in, 1649, and, the, hudson, s, bay, company, founded, in, 1670, these, early, corporations, engaged, in, international, trade, and, exploration, and, set, up, trading, posts, the, dutch, government, took, over, the, voc, in, 1799, and, during, the, 19th, century, other, governments, increasingly, took, over, the, private, companies, most, notable, in, british, india, during, the, process, of, decolonization, the, european, colonial, charter, companies, were, disbanded, with, the, final, colonial, corporation, the, mozambique, company, dissolving, in, 1972, mining, of, gold, silver, copper, and, oil, was, a, major, activity, early, on, and, remains, so, today, international, mining, companies, became, prominent, in, britain, in, the, 19th, century, such, as, the, rio, tinto, company, founded, in, 1873, which, started, with, the, purchase, of, sulfur, and, copper, mines, from, the, spanish, government, rio, tinto, now, based, in, london, and, melbourne, australia, has, made, many, acquisitions, and, expanded, globally, to, mine, aluminum, iron, ore, copper, uranium, and, diamonds, european, mines, in, south, africa, began, opening, in, the, late, 19th, century, producing, gold, and, other, minerals, for, the, world, market, jobs, for, locals, and, business, and, profits, for, companies, cecil, rhodes, 1853, 1902, was, one, of, the, few, businessmen, in, the, era, who, became, prime, minister, of, south, africa, 1890, 1896, his, mining, enterprises, included, the, british, south, africa, company, and, de, beers, the, latter, company, practically, controlled, the, global, diamond, market, from, its, base, in, southern, africa, in, 1945, the, united, states, was, the, world, s, largest, oil, producer, however, their, reserves, were, declining, due, to, high, demand, therefore, the, united, states, turned, to, foreign, oil, sources, which, had, a, significant, impact, on, the, recovery, of, the, west, after, world, war, ii, most, of, the, world, s, oil, was, found, in, latin, america, and, the, middle, east, particularly, in, the, arab, states, of, the, persian, gulf, this, increase, in, non, american, production, was, enabled, by, multinational, corporations, known, as, the, seven, sisters, the, seven, sisters, was, a, common, term, for, the, seven, multinational, companies, that, dominated, the, global, petroleum, industry, from, the, mid, 1940s, to, the, mid, 1970s, the, nationalization, of, the, iranian, oil, industry, in, 1951, by, iranian, prime, minister, mohammad, mosaddegh, and, the, subsequent, boycott, of, iranian, oil, by, all, companies, had, dramatic, consequences, for, iran, and, the, international, oil, market, iran, was, unable, to, sell, any, of, its, oil, in, august, 1953, the, then, prime, minister, was, overthrown, by, a, pro, american, dictatorship, led, by, the, shah, and, in, october, 1954, the, iranian, industry, was, denationalized, worldwide, oil, consumption, increased, rapidly, between, 1949, and, 1970, a, period, known, as, the, golden, age, of, oil, this, increase, in, consumption, was, caused, not, only, by, the, growth, of, production, by, multinational, oil, companies, but, also, by, the, strong, influence, of, the, united, states, on, the, global, oil, market, in, 1959, companies, lowered, the, price, of, oil, due, to, a, surplus, in, the, market, this, reduction, dealt, a, significant, blow, to, the, finances, of, producers, saudi, oil, minister, abdullah, tariki, and, venezuela, s, juan, perez, alfonso, entered, into, a, secret, agreement, the, mahdi, pact, promising, that, if, the, price, of, oil, was, lowered, a, second, time, they, would, take, collective, action, against, the, companies, this, occurred, in, 1960, prior, to, the, 1973, oil, crisis, the, seven, sisters, controlled, around, 85, percent, of, the, world, s, petroleum, reserves, in, the, 1970s, most, countries, with, large, reserves, nationalized, their, reserves, that, had, been, owned, by, major, oil, companies, since, then, industry, dominance, has, shifted, to, the, opec, cartel, and, state, owned, oil, and, gas, companies, such, as, saudi, aramco, gazprom, russia, china, national, petroleum, corporation, national, iranian, oil, company, pdvsa, venezuela, petrobras, brazil, and, petronas, malaysia, unilateral, increase, in, oil, prices, was, labeled, as, the, largest, nonviolent, transfer, of, wealth, in, human, history, the, opec, sought, immediate, discussions, regarding, participation, in, national, oil, industries, companies, were, not, inclined, to, object, as, the, price, hike, benefited, both, them, and, opec, members, in, 1980, the, seven, sisters, were, entirely, displaced, and, replaced, by, national, oil, companies, nocs, the, rise, in, oil, prices, burdened, developing, countries, with, balance, of, payments, deficits, leading, to, an, energy, crisis, opec, members, had, to, abandon, their, plan, of, redistributing, wealth, from, the, west, to, the, post, colonial, south, and, invest, either, in, foreign, expenditures, or, ostentatious, economic, development, projects, after, 1974, most, of, the, money, from, opec, members, ceased, as, payments, for, goods, and, services, or, investments, in, western, industry, in, february, 1974, the, first, washington, energy, conference, was, convened, the, most, significant, contribution, of, this, conference, was, the, establishment, of, the, international, energy, agency, iea, enabling, states, to, coordinate, policy, gather, data, and, monitor, global, oil, reserves, in, the, 1970s, opec, gradually, nationalized, the, seven, sisters, the, kingdom, of, saudi, arabia, as, the, only, largest, world, oil, producer, could, leverage, this, however, saudi, arabia, opted, for, the, correct, approach, and, maintained, consistent, oil, prices, throughout, the, 1970s, in, 1979, the, second, oil, shock, came, from, the, collapse, of, the, shah, s, regime, in, iran, iran, became, a, regional, power, due, to, oil, money, and, american, weapons, the, shah, eventually, abdicated, and, fled, the, country, this, prompted, a, strike, by, thousands, of, iranian, oil, workers, significantly, reducing, oil, production, in, iran, saudi, arabia, tried, to, cope, with, the, crisis, by, increasing, production, but, oil, prices, still, soared, leading, to, the, second, oil, shock, saudi, arabia, significantly, reduced, oil, production, losing, most, of, its, revenues, in, 1986, riyadh, changed, course, and, oil, production, in, saudi, arabia, sharply, increased, flooding, the, market, with, cheap, oil, this, caused, a, worldwide, drop, in, oil, prices, hence, the, third, oil, shock, or, counter, shock, however, this, shock, represented, something, much, bigger, the, end, of, opec, s, dominance, and, its, control, over, oil, prices, iraqi, president, saddam, hussein, decided, to, attack, kuwait, the, invasion, sparked, a, crisis, in, the, middle, east, prompting, saudi, arabia, to, request, assistance, from, the, united, states, the, united, states, sent, a, million, troops, to, help, and, by, february, 1991, iraqi, forces, were, expelled, from, kuwait, due, to, the, oil, boycott, from, kuwait, and, iran, oil, prices, rose, and, quickly, recovered, saudi, arabia, once, again, led, opec, and, thanks, to, assistance, in, defending, kuwait, new, relations, emerged, between, the, usa, and, opec, operation, desert, storm, brought, mutual, dependence, among, the, main, oil, producers, opec, continued, to, influence, global, oil, prices, but, recognized, the, united, states, as, the, largest, consumer, and, guarantor, of, the, existing, oil, security, order, since, the, iraq, war, opec, has, only, a, minor, influence, on, oil, prices, but, it, has, expanded, to, 11, members, accounting, for, about, 40, percent, of, total, global, oil, production, although, this, is, a, decline, from, nearly, 50, percent, in, 1974, oil, has, practically, become, a, common, commodity, leading, to, much, more, volatile, prices, most, opec, members, are, wealthy, and, most, remain, dependent, on, oil, revenues, which, has, serious, consequences, such, as, when, opec, members, were, pressured, by, the, price, collapse, in, 1998, 1999, the, united, states, still, maintains, close, relations, with, saudi, arabia, in, 2003, u, s, forces, invaded, iraq, with, the, aim, of, removing, the, dictatorship, and, gaining, access, to, iraqi, oil, reserves, giving, the, united, states, greater, strategic, importance, from, 2000, to, 2008, during, this, period, there, was, a, constant, shortage, of, oil, but, its, consumption, continued, to, rise, maintaining, high, prices, and, leading, to, concerns, about, peak, oil, from, 2005, to, 2012, there, were, advances, in, oil, and, gas, extraction, leading, to, increased, production, in, the, united, states, from, 2010, the, usa, became, the, leading, oil, producer, creating, tension, with, opec, in, 2014, saudi, arabia, increased, production, to, push, new, american, producers, out, of, the, market, leading, to, lower, prices, opec, then, reduced, production, in, 2016, to, raise, prices, further, worsening, relations, with, the, united, states, by, 2012, only, 7, of, the, world, s, known, oil, reserves, were, in, countries, that, allowed, private, international, companies, free, rein, 65, were, in, the, hands, of, state, owned, companies, that, operated, in, one, country, and, sold, oil, to, multinationals, such, as, bp, shell, exxonmobil, and, chevron, down, through, the, 1930s, about, 80, of, the, international, investments, by, the, multinational, corporations, were, concentrated, in, the, primary, sector, especially, mining, especially, oil, and, agriculture, rubber, tobacco, sugar, palm, oil, coffee, cocoa, tropical, fruits, most, went, to, the, third, world, colonies, that, changed, dramatically, after, 1945, as, investors, turned, to, industrialized, countries, and, invested, in, manufacturing, especially, high, tech, electronics, chemicals, drugs, and, vehicles, as, well, as, trade, sweden, s, leading, manufacturing, concern, was, skf, a, leading, maker, of, bearings, for, machinery, in, order, to, expand, its, international, business, it, decided, in, 1966, it, needed, to, use, the, english, language, senior, officials, although, mostly, still, swedish, all, learned, english, and, all, major, internal, documents, were, in, english, the, lingua, franca, of, multinational, corporations, after, the, war, the, number, of, businesses, having, at, least, one, foreign, country, operation, rose, drastically, from, a, few, thousand, to, 78, 411, in, 2007, meanwhile, 74, of, parent, companies, are, located, in, economically, advanced, countries, developing, and, former, communist, countries, such, as, china, india, and, brazil, being, the, largest, recipients, however, 70, of, foreign, direct, investment, went, into, developed, countries, in, the, form, of, stocks, and, cash, flows, the, rise, of, the, number, of, multinational, companies, could, be, due, to, a, stable, political, environment, that, encourages, cooperation, advances, in, technology, that, enables, management, of, faraway, regions, and, favorable, organizational, development, that, encourages, business, expansion, into, other, countries, a, multinational, corporation, mnc, is, usually, a, large, corporation, incorporated, in, one, country, which, produces, or, sells, goods, or, services, in, various, countries, two, common, characteristics, shared, by, mncs, are, their, large, size, and, centrally, controlled, worldwide, activities, mncs, may, gain, from, their, global, presence, in, a, variety, of, ways, first, of, all, mncs, can, benefit, from, the, economy, of, scale, by, spreading, r, d, expenditures, and, advertising, costs, over, their, global, sales, pooling, global, purchasing, power, over, suppliers, and, utilizing, their, technological, and, managerial, experience, globally, with, minimal, additional, costs, furthermore, mncs, can, use, their, global, presence, to, take, advantage, of, underpriced, labor, services, available, in, certain, developing, countries, and, gain, access, to, special, r, d, capabilities, residing, in, advanced, foreign, countries, the, problem, of, moral, and, legal, constraints, upon, the, behavior, of, multinational, corporations, given, that, they, are, effectively, stateless, actors, is, one, of, several, urgent, global, socioeconomic, problems, that, has, emerged, during, the, late, twentieth, century, potentially, the, best, concept, for, analyzing, society, s, governance, limitations, over, modern, corporations, is, the, concept, of, stateless, corporations, coined, at, least, as, early, as, 1991, in, business, week, the, conception, was, theoretically, clarified, in, 1993, that, an, empirical, strategy, for, defining, a, stateless, corporation, is, with, analytical, tools, at, the, intersection, between, demographic, analysis, and, transportation, research, this, intersection, is, known, as, logistics, management, and, it, describes, the, importance, of, rapidly, increasing, global, mobility, of, resources, in, a, long, history, of, analysis, of, multinational, corporations, we, are, some, quarter, century, into, an, era, of, stateless, corporations, corporations, that, meet, the, realities, of, the, needs, of, source, materials, on, a, worldwide, basis, and, to, produce, and, customize, products, for, individual, countries, one, of, the, first, multinational, business, organizations, the, east, india, company, was, established, in, 1601, after, the, east, india, company, came, the, dutch, east, india, company, founded, on, march, 20, 1603, which, would, become, the, largest, company, in, the, world, for, nearly, 200, years, the, main, characteristics, of, multinational, companies, are, when, a, corporation, invests, in, a, country, in, which, it, is, not, domiciled, it, is, called, foreign, direct, investment, fdi, countries, may, place, restrictions, on, direct, investment, for, example, china, has, historically, required, partnerships, with, local, firms, or, special, approval, for, certain, types, of, investments, by, foreigners, although, some, of, these, restrictions, were, eased, in, 2019, similarly, the, united, states, committee, on, foreign, investment, in, the, united, states, scrutinizes, foreign, investments, in, addition, corporations, may, be, prohibited, from, various, business, transactions, by, international, sanctions, or, domestic, laws, for, example, chinese, domestic, corporations, or, citizens, have, limitations, on, their, ability, to, make, foreign, investments, outside, china, in, part, to, reduce, capital, outflow, countries, can, impose, extraterritorial, sanctions, on, foreign, corporations, even, for, doing, business, with, other, foreign, corporations, which, occurred, in, 2019, with, the, united, states, sanctions, against, iran, european, companies, faced, with, the, possibility, of, losing, access, to, the, u, s, market, by, trading, with, iran, international, investment, agreements, also, facilitate, direct, investment, between, two, countries, such, as, the, north, american, free, trade, agreement, and, most, favored, nation, status, raymond, vernon, reported, in, 1977, that, of, the, largest, multinationals, focused, on, manufacturing, 250, were, headquartered, in, the, united, states, 115, in, western, europe, 70, in, japan, and, 20, in, the, rest, of, the, world, the, multinationals, in, banking, numbered, 20, headquartered, in, the, united, states, 13, in, europe, nine, in, japan, and, three, in, canada, today, multinationals, can, select, from, a, variety, of, jurisdictions, for, various, subsidiaries, but, the, ultimate, parent, company, can, select, a, single, legal, domicile, the, economist, suggests, that, the, netherlands, has, become, a, popular, choice, as, its, company, laws, have, fewer, requirements, for, meetings, compensation, and, audit, committees, and, great, britain, had, advantages, due, to, laws, on, withholding, dividends, and, a, double, taxation, treaty, with, the, united, states, corporations, can, legally, engage, in, tax, avoidance, through, their, choice, of, jurisdiction, but, must, be, careful, to, avoid, illegal, tax, evasion, corporations, that, are, broadly, active, across, the, world, without, a, concentration, in, one, area, have, been, called, stateless, or, transnational, although, transnational, corporation, is, also, used, synonymously, with, multinational, corporation, but, as, of, 1992, a, corporation, must, be, legally, domiciled, in, a, particular, country, and, engage, in, other, countries, through, foreign, direct, investment, and, the, creation, of, foreign, subsidiaries, geographic, diversification, can, be, measured, across, various, domains, including, ownership, and, control, workforce, sales, and, regulation, and, taxation, multinational, corporations, may, be, subject, to, the, laws, and, regulations, of, both, their, domicile, and, the, additional, jurisdictions, where, they, are, engaged, in, business, in, some, cases, the, jurisdiction, can, help, to, avoid, burdensome, laws, but, regulatory, statutes, often, target, the, enterprise, with, statutory, language, around, control, as, of, 1992, the, united, states, and, most, oecd, countries, have, the, legal, authority, to, tax, a, domiciled, parent, corporation, on, its, worldwide, revenue, including, subsidiaries, 117, as, of, 2019, the, u, s, applies, its, corporate, taxation, extraterritorially, which, has, motivated, tax, inversions, to, change, the, home, state, by, 2019, most, oecd, nations, with, the, notable, exception, of, the, u, s, had, moved, to, territorial, tax, in, which, only, revenue, inside, the, border, was, taxed, however, these, nations, typically, scrutinize, foreign, income, with, controlled, foreign, corporation, cfc, rules, to, avoid, base, erosion, and, profit, shifting, in, practice, even, under, an, extraterritorial, system, taxes, may, be, deferred, until, remittance, with, possible, repatriation, tax, holidays, and, subject, to, foreign, tax, credits, 117, countries, generally, cannot, tax, the, worldwide, revenue, of, a, foreign, subsidiary, and, taxation, is, complicated, by, transfer, pricing, arrangements, with, parent, corporations, 117, for, small, corporations, registering, a, foreign, subsidiary, can, be, expensive, and, complex, involving, fees, signatures, and, forms, a, professional, employer, organization, peo, is, sometimes, advertised, as, a, cheaper, and, simpler, alternative, but, not, all, jurisdictions, have, laws, accepting, these, types, of, arrangements, disputes, between, corporations, in, different, nations, is, often, handled, through, international, arbitration, the, actions, of, multinational, corporations, are, strongly, supported, by, economic, liberalism, and, free, market, system, in, a, globalized, international, society, according, to, the, economic, realist, view, individuals, act, in, rational, ways, to, maximize, their, self, interest, and, therefore, when, individuals, act, rationally, markets, are, created, and, they, function, best, in, a, free, market, system, where, there, is, little, government, interference, as, a, result, international, wealth, is, maximized, with, free, exchange, of, goods, and, services, to, many, economic, liberals, multinational, corporations, are, the, vanguard, of, the, liberal, order, they, are, the, embodiment, par, excellence, of, the, liberal, ideal, of, an, interdependent, world, economy, they, have, taken, the, integration, of, national, economies, beyond, trade, and, money, to, the, internationalization, of, production, for, the, first, time, in, history, production, marketing, and, investment, are, being, organized, on, a, global, scale, rather, than, in, terms, of, isolated, national, economies, international, business, is, also, a, specialist, field, of, academic, research, economic, theories, of, the, multinational, corporation, include, internalization, theory, and, the, eclectic, paradigm, the, latter, is, also, known, as, the, oli, framework, the, other, theoretical, dimension, of, the, role, of, multinational, corporations, concerns, the, relationship, between, the, globalization, of, economic, engagement, and, the, culture, of, national, and, local, responses, this, has, a, history, of, self, conscious, cultural, management, going, back, at, least, to, the, 60s, for, example, ernest, dichter, architect, of, exxon, s, international, campaign, writing, in, the, harvard, business, review, in, 1963, was, fully, aware, that, the, means, to, overcoming, cultural, resistance, depended, on, an, understanding, of, the, countries, in, which, a, corporation, operated, he, observed, that, companies, with, foresight, to, capitalize, on, international, opportunities, must, recognize, that, cultural, anthropology, will, be, an, important, tool, for, competitive, marketing, however, the, projected, outcome, of, this, was, not, the, assimilation, of, international, firms, into, national, cultures, but, the, creation, of, a, world, customer, the, idea, of, a, global, corporate, village, entailed, the, management, and, reconstitution, of, parochial, attachments, to, one, s, nation, it, involved, not, a, denial, of, the, naturalness, of, national, attachments, but, an, internationalization, of, the, way, a, nation, defines, itself, multinational, enterprise, mne, is, the, term, used, by, international, economist, and, similarly, defined, with, the, multinational, corporation, mnc, as, an, enterprise, that, controls, and, manages, production, establishments, known, as, plants, located, in, at, least, two, countries, the, multinational, enterprise, mne, will, engage, in, foreign, direct, investment, fdi, as, the, firm, makes, direct, investments, in, host, country, plants, for, equity, ownership, and, managerial, control, to, avoid, some, transaction, costs, sanjaya, lall, in, 1974, proposed, a, spectrum, of, scholarly, analysis, of, multinational, corporations, from, the, political, right, to, the, left, he, put, the, business, school, how, to, do, it, writers, at, the, extreme, right, followed, by, the, liberal, laissez, faire, economists, and, the, neoliberals, they, remain, right, of, center, but, do, allow, for, occasional, mistakes, of, the, marketplace, such, as, externalities, moving, to, the, left, side, of, the, line, are, nationalists, who, prioritize, national, interests, over, corporate, profits, then, the, dependencia, school, in, latin, america, that, focuses, on, the, evils, of, imperialism, and, on, the, far, left, the, marxists, the, range, is, so, broad, that, scholarly, consensus, is, hard, to, discern, anti, corporate, advocates, criticize, multinational, corporations, for, being, without, a, basis, in, a, national, ethos, being, ultimate, without, a, specific, nationhood, and, that, this, lack, of, an, ethos, appears, in, their, ways, of, operating, as, they, enter, into, contracts, with, countries, that, have, low, human, rights, or, environmental, standards, in, the, world, economy, facilitated, by, multinational, corporations, capital, will, increasingly, be, able, to, play, workers, communities, and, nations, off, against, one, another, as, they, demand, tax, regulation, and, wage, concessions, while, threatening, to, move, in, other, words, increased, mobility, of, multinational, corporations, benefits, capital, while, workers, and, communities, lose, some, negative, outcomes, generated, by, multinational, corporations, include, increased, inequality, unemployment, and, wage, stagnation, raymond, vernon, presents, the, debate, from, a, neo, liberal, perspective, in, storm, over, the, multinationals, 1977, the, aggressive, use, of, tax, avoidance, schemes, and, multinational, tax, havens, allows, multinational, corporations, to, gain, competitive, advantages, over, small, and, medium, sized, enterprises, organizations, such, as, the, tax, justice, network, criticize, governments, for, allowing, multinational, organizations, to, escape, tax, particularly, by, using, base, erosion, and, profit, shifting, beps, tax, tools, since, less, money, can, be, spent, for, public, services
