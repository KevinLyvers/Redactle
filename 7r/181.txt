set, of, skills, tests, vary, in, style, rigor, and, requirements, there, is, no, general, consensus, or, invariable, standard, for, test, formats, and, difficulty, often, the, format, and, difficulty, of, the, test, is, dependent, upon, the, educational, philosophy, of, the, instructor, subject, matter, class, size, policy, of, the, educational, institution, and, requirements, of,

instances, the, developer, of, the, test, may, not, be, directly, responsible, for, its, administration, for, example, in, the, united, states, educational, testing, service, ets, a, nonprofit, educational, testing, and, assessment, organization, develops, standardized, tests, such, as, the, sat, but, may, not, directly, be, involved, in, the, administration, or, proctoring, of, these, tests, informal, unofficial, and, non, standardized, tests, and, testing, systems, have, existed, throughout, history, for, example, tests, of, skill, such, as, archery, contests, have, existed, in, china, since, the, zhou, dynasty, or, more, mythologically, yao, oral, exams, were, administered, in, various, parts, of, the, world, including, ancient, china, and, europe, a, precursor, to, the, later, chinese, imperial, examinations, was, in, place, since, the, han, dynasty, during, which, the, confucian, characteristic, of, the, examinations, was, determined, however, these, examinations, did, not, offer, an, official, avenue, to, government, appointment, the, majority, of, which, were, filled, through, recommendations, based, on, qualities, such, as, social, status, morals, and, ability, standardized, written, examinations, were, first, implemented, in, china, they, were, commonly, known, as, the, imperial, examinations, keju, the, bureaucratic, imperial, examinations, as, a, concept, has, its, origins, in, the, year, 605, during, the, short, lived, sui, dynasty, its, successor, the, tang, dynasty, implemented, imperial, examinations, on, a, relatively, small, scale, until, the, examination, system, was, extensively, expanded, during, the, reign, of, wu, zetian, included, in, the, expanded, examination, system, was, a, military, exam, that, tested, physical, ability, but, the, military, exam, never, had, a, significant, impact, on, the, chinese, officer, corps, and, military, degrees, were, seen, as, inferior, to, their, civil, counterpart, the, exact, nature, of, wu, s, influence, on, the, examination, system, is, still, a, matter, of, scholarly, debate, during, the, song, dynasty, the, emperors, expanded, both, examinations, and, the, government, school, system, in, part, to, counter, the, influence, of, hereditary, nobility, increasing, the, number, of, degree, holders, to, more, than, four, to, five, times, that, of, the, tang, from, the, song, dynasty, onward, the, examinations, played, the, primary, role, in, selecting, scholar, officials, who, formed, the, literati, elite, of, society, however, the, examinations, co, existed, with, other, forms, of, recruitment, such, as, direct, appointments, for, the, ruling, family, nominations, quotas, clerical, promotions, sale, of, official, titles, and, special, procedures, for, eunuchs, the, regular, higher, level, degree, examination, cycle, was, decreed, in, 1067, to, be, 3, years, but, this, triennial, cycle, only, existed, in, nominal, terms, in, practice, both, before, and, after, this, the, examinations, were, irregularly, implemented, for, significant, periods, of, time, thus, the, calculated, statistical, averages, for, the, number, of, degrees, conferred, annually, should, be, understood, in, this, context, the, jinshi, exams, were, not, a, yearly, event, and, should, not, be, considered, so, the, annual, average, figures, are, a, necessary, artifact, of, quantitative, analysis, the, operations, of, the, examination, system, were, part, of, the, imperial, record, keeping, system, and, the, date, of, receiving, the, jinshi, degree, is, often, a, key, biographical, datum, sometimes, the, date, of, achieving, jinshi, is, the, only, firm, date, known, for, even, some, of, the, most, historically, prominent, persons, in, chinese, history, a, brief, interruption, to, the, examinations, occurred, at, the, beginning, of, the, mongol, yuan, dynasty, in, the, 13th, century, but, was, later, brought, back, with, regional, quotas, which, favored, the, mongols, and, disadvantaged, southern, chinese, during, the, ming, and, qing, dynasties, the, system, contributed, to, the, narrow, and, focused, nature, of, intellectual, life, and, enhanced, the, autocratic, power, of, the, emperor, the, system, continued, with, some, modifications, until, its, abolition, in, 1905, during, the, last, years, of, the, qing, dynasty, the, modern, examination, system, for, selecting, civil, servants, also, indirectly, evolved, from, the, imperial, one, japan, implemented, the, examination, system, for, 200, years, during, the, heian, period, 794, 1185, like, the, chinese, examinations, the, curriculum, revolved, around, the, confucian, canon, however, unlike, in, china, it, was, only, ever, applied, to, the, minor, nobility, and, so, gradually, faded, away, under, the, hereditary, system, during, the, samurai, era, the, examination, system, was, established, in, korea, in, 958, under, the, reign, of, gwangjong, of, goryeo, any, free, man, not, nobi, was, able, to, take, the, examinations, by, the, joseon, period, high, offices, were, closed, to, aristocrats, who, had, not, passed, the, exams, the, examination, system, continued, until, 1894, when, it, was, abolished, by, the, gabo, reform, as, in, china, the, content, of, the, examinations, focused, on, the, confucian, canon, and, ensured, a, loyal, scholar, bureaucrat, class, which, upheld, the, throne, the, confucian, examination, system, in, vietnam, was, established, in, 1075, under, the, l, dynasty, emperor, l, nh, n, t, ng, and, lasted, until, the, nguy, n, dynasty, emperor, kh, i, nh, 1919, there, were, only, three, levels, of, examinations, in, vietnam, interprovincial, pre, court, and, court, the, imperial, examination, system, was, known, to, europeans, as, early, as, 1570, it, received, great, attention, from, the, jesuit, matteo, ricci, 1552, 1610, who, viewed, it, and, its, confucian, appeal, to, rationalism, favorably, in, comparison, to, religious, reliance, on, apocalypse, knowledge, of, confucianism, and, the, examination, system, was, disseminated, broadly, in, europe, following, the, latin, translation, of, ricci, s, journal, in, 1614, during, the, 18th, century, the, imperial, examinations, were, often, discussed, in, conjunction, with, confucianism, which, attracted, great, attention, from, contemporary, european, thinkers, such, as, gottfried, wilhelm, leibniz, voltaire, montesquieu, baron, d, holbach, johann, wolfgang, von, goethe, and, friedrich, schiller, in, france, and, britain, confucian, ideology, was, used, in, attacking, the, privilege, of, the, elite, figures, such, as, voltaire, claimed, that, the, chinese, had, perfected, moral, science, and, fran, ois, quesnay, advocated, an, economic, and, political, system, modeled, after, that, of, the, chinese, according, to, ferdinand, bruneti, re, 1849, 1906, followers, of, physiocracy, such, as, fran, ois, quesnay, whose, theory, of, free, trade, was, based, on, chinese, classical, theory, were, sinophiles, bent, on, introducing, l, esprit, chinois, to, france, he, also, admits, that, french, education, was, really, based, on, chinese, literary, examinations, which, were, popularized, in, france, by, philosophers, especially, voltaire, western, perception, of, china, in, the, 18th, century, admired, the, chinese, bureaucratic, system, as, favourable, over, european, governments, for, its, seeming, meritocracy, however, those, who, admired, china, such, as, christian, wolff, were, sometimes, persecuted, in, 1721, he, gave, a, lecture, at, the, university, of, halle, praising, confucianism, for, which, he, was, accused, of, atheism, and, forced, to, give, up, his, position, at, the, university, the, earliest, evidence, of, examinations, in, europe, date, to, 1215, or, 1219, in, bologna, these, were, chiefly, oral, in, the, form, of, a, question, or, answer, disputation, determination, defense, or, public, lecture, the, candidate, gave, a, public, lecture, of, two, prepared, passages, assigned, to, him, from, the, civil, or, canon, law, and, then, doctors, asked, him, questions, or, expressed, objections, to, answers, evidence, of, written, examinations, do, not, appear, until, 1702, at, trinity, college, cambridge, according, to, sir, michael, sadler, europe, may, have, had, written, examinations, since, 1518, but, he, admits, the, evidence, is, not, very, clear, in, prussia, medication, examinations, began, in, 1725, the, mathematical, tripos, founded, in, 1747, is, commonly, believed, to, be, the, first, honor, examination, but, james, bass, mullinger, considered, the, candidates, not, having, really, undergone, any, examination, whatsoever, because, the, qualification, for, a, degree, was, merely, four, years, of, residence, france, adopted, the, examination, system, in, 1791, as, a, result, of, the, french, revolution, but, it, collapsed, after, only, ten, years, germany, implemented, the, examination, system, around, 1800, englishmen, in, the, 18th, century, such, as, eustace, budgell, recommended, imitating, the, chinese, examination, system, but, the, first, english, person, to, recommend, competitive, examinations, to, qualify, for, employment, was, adam, smith, in, 1776, in, 1838, the, congregational, church, missionary, walter, henry, medhurst, considered, the, chinese, exams, to, be, worthy, of, imitating, in, 1806, the, british, established, a, civil, service, college, near, london, for, training, of, the, east, india, company, s, administrators, in, india, this, was, based, on, the, recommendations, of, british, east, india, company, officials, serving, in, china, and, had, seen, the, imperial, examinations, in, 1829, the, company, introduced, civil, service, examinations, in, india, on, a, limited, basis, this, established, the, principle, of, qualification, process, for, civil, servants, in, england, in, 1847, and, 1856, thomas, taylor, meadows, strongly, recommended, the, adoption, of, the, chinese, principle, of, competitive, examinations, in, great, britain, in, his, desultory, notes, on, the, government, and, people, of, china, according, to, meadows, the, long, duration, of, the, chinese, empire, is, solely, and, altogether, owing, to, the, good, government, which, consists, in, the, advancement, of, men, of, talent, and, merit, only, both, thomas, babington, macaulay, who, was, instrumental, in, passing, the, saint, helena, act, 1833, and, stafford, northcote, 1st, earl, of, iddesleigh, who, prepared, the, northcote, trevelyan, report, that, catalyzed, the, british, civil, service, were, familiar, with, chinese, history, and, institutions, the, northcote, trevelyan, report, of, 1854, made, four, principal, recommendations, that, recruitment, should, be, on, the, basis, of, merit, determined, through, standardized, written, examination, that, candidates, should, have, a, solid, general, education, to, enable, inter, departmental, transfers, that, recruits, should, be, graded, into, a, hierarchy, and, that, promotion, should, be, through, achievement, rather, than, preferment, patronage, or, purchase, when, the, report, was, brought, up, in, parliament, in, 1853, lord, monteagle, argued, against, the, implementation, of, open, examinations, because, it, was, a, chinese, system, and, china, was, not, an, enlightened, country, lord, stanley, called, the, examinations, the, chinese, principle, the, earl, of, granville, did, not, deny, this, but, argued, in, favor, of, the, examination, system, considering, that, the, minority, manchus, had, been, able, to, rule, china, with, it, for, over, 200, years, in, 1854, edwin, chadwick, reported, that, some, noblemen, did, not, agree, with, the, measures, introduced, because, they, were, chinese, the, examination, system, was, finally, implemented, in, the, british, indian, civil, service, in, 1855, prior, to, which, admission, into, the, civil, service, was, purely, a, matter, of, patronage, and, in, england, in, 1870, even, as, late, as, ten, years, after, the, competitive, examination, plan, was, passed, people, still, attacked, it, as, an, adopted, chinese, culture, alexander, baillie, cochrane, 1st, baron, lamington, insisted, that, the, english, did, not, know, that, it, was, necessary, for, them, to, take, lessons, from, the, celestial, empire, in, 1875, archibald, sayce, voiced, concern, over, the, prevalence, of, competitive, examinations, which, he, described, as, the, invasion, of, this, new, chinese, culture, after, great, britain, s, successful, implementation, of, systematic, open, and, competitive, examinations, in, india, in, the, 19th, century, similar, systems, were, instituted, in, the, united, kingdom, itself, and, in, other, western, nations, like, the, british, the, development, of, the, french, and, american, civil, service, was, influenced, by, the, chinese, system, when, thomas, jenckes, made, a, report, from, the, joint, select, committee, on, retrenchment, in, 1868, it, contained, a, chapter, on, the, civil, service, in, china, in, 1870, william, spear, wrote, a, book, called, the, oldest, and, the, newest, empire, china, and, the, united, states, in, which, he, urged, the, united, states, government, to, adopt, the, chinese, examination, system, like, in, britain, many, of, the, american, elites, scorned, the, plan, to, implement, competitive, examinations, which, they, considered, foreign, chinese, and, un, american, as, a, result, the, civil, services, reform, introduced, into, the, house, of, representatives, in, 1868, was, not, passed, until, 1883, the, civil, service, commission, tried, to, combat, such, sentiments, in, its, report, with, no, intention, of, commending, either, the, religion, or, the, imperialism, of, china, we, could, not, see, why, the, fact, that, the, most, enlightened, and, enduring, government, of, the, eastern, world, had, acquired, an, examination, as, to, the, merits, of, candidates, for, office, should, any, more, deprive, the, american, people, of, that, advantage, if, it, might, be, an, advantage, than, the, facts, that, confucius, had, taught, political, morality, and, the, people, of, china, had, read, books, used, the, compass, gunpowder, and, the, multiplication, table, during, centuries, when, this, continent, was, a, wilderness, should, deprive, our, people, of, those, conveniences, standardized, testing, began, to, influence, the, method, of, examination, in, british, universities, from, the, 1850s, where, oral, exams, had, common, since, the, middle, ages, in, the, us, the, transition, happened, under, the, influence, of, the, educational, reformer, horace, mann, the, shift, helped, standardize, an, expansion, of, the, curricula, into, the, sciences, and, humanities, creating, a, rationalized, method, for, the, evaluation, of, teachers, and, institutions, and, creating, a, basis, for, the, streaming, of, students, according, to, ability, both, world, war, i, and, world, war, ii, demonstrated, the, necessity, of, standardized, testing, and, the, benefits, associated, with, these, tests, tests, were, used, to, determine, the, mental, aptitude, of, recruits, to, the, military, the, us, army, used, the, stanford, binet, intelligence, scale, to, test, the, iq, of, the, soldiers, after, the, war, industry, began, using, tests, to, evaluate, applicants, for, various, jobs, based, on, performance, in, 1952, the, first, advanced, placement, ap, test, was, administered, to, begin, closing, the, gap, between, high, schools, and, colleges, tests, are, used, throughout, most, educational, systems, tests, may, range, from, brief, informal, questions, chosen, by, the, teacher, to, major, tests, that, students, and, teachers, spend, months, preparing, for, some, countries, such, as, the, united, kingdom, and, france, require, all, their, secondary, school, students, to, take, a, standardized, test, on, individual, subjects, such, as, the, general, certificate, of, secondary, education, gcse, in, england, and, baccalaur, at, respectively, as, a, requirement, for, graduation, these, tests, are, used, primarily, to, assess, a, student, s, proficiency, in, specific, subjects, such, as, mathematics, science, or, literature, in, contrast, high, school, students, in, other, countries, such, as, the, united, states, may, not, be, required, to, take, a, standardized, test, to, graduate, moreover, students, in, these, countries, usually, take, standardized, tests, only, to, apply, for, a, position, in, a, university, program, and, are, typically, given, the, option, of, taking, different, standardized, tests, such, as, the, act, or, sat, which, are, used, primarily, to, measure, a, student, s, reasoning, skill, high, school, students, in, the, united, states, may, also, take, advanced, placement, tests, on, specific, subjects, to, fulfill, university, level, credit, depending, on, the, policies, of, the, test, maker, or, country, administration, of, standardized, tests, may, be, done, in, a, large, hall, classroom, or, testing, center, a, proctor, or, invigilator, may, also, be, present, during, the, testing, period, to, provide, instructions, to, answer, questions, or, to, prevent, cheating, grades, or, test, scores, from, standardized, test, may, also, be, used, by, universities, to, determine, whether, a, student, applicant, should, be, admitted, into, one, of, its, academic, or, professional, programs, for, example, universities, in, the, united, kingdom, admit, applicants, into, their, undergraduate, programs, based, primarily, or, solely, on, an, applicant, s, grades, on, pre, university, qualifications, such, as, the, gce, a, levels, or, cambridge, pre, u, in, contrast, universities, in, the, united, states, use, an, applicant, s, test, score, on, the, sat, or, act, as, just, one, of, their, many, admission, criteria, to, determine, whether, an, applicant, should, be, admitted, into, one, of, its, undergraduate, programs, the, other, criteria, in, this, case, may, include, the, applicant, s, grades, from, high, school, extracurricular, activities, personal, statement, and, letters, of, recommendations, once, admitted, undergraduate, students, in, the, united, kingdom, or, united, states, may, be, required, by, their, respective, programs, to, take, a, comprehensive, examination, as, a, requirement, for, passing, their, courses, or, for, graduating, from, their, respective, programs, standardized, tests, are, sometimes, used, by, certain, countries, to, manage, the, quality, of, their, educational, institutions, for, example, the, no, child, left, behind, act, in, the, united, states, requires, individual, states, to, develop, assessments, for, students, in, certain, grades, in, practice, these, assessments, typically, appear, in, the, form, of, standardized, tests, test, scores, of, students, in, specific, grades, of, an, educational, institution, are, then, used, to, determine, the, status, of, that, educational, institution, i, e, whether, it, should, be, allowed, to, continue, to, operate, in, the, same, way, or, to, receive, funding, finally, standardized, tests, are, sometimes, used, to, compare, proficiencies, of, students, from, different, institutions, or, countries, for, example, the, organisation, for, economic, co, operation, and, development, oecd, uses, programme, for, international, student, assessment, pisa, to, evaluate, certain, skills, and, knowledge, of, students, from, different, participating, countries, standardized, tests, are, sometimes, used, by, certain, governing, bodies, to, determine, whether, a, test, taker, is, allowed, to, practice, a, profession, to, use, a, specific, job, title, or, to, claim, competency, in, a, specific, set, of, skills, for, example, a, test, taker, who, intends, to, become, a, lawyer, is, usually, required, by, a, governing, body, such, as, a, governmental, bar, licensing, agency, to, pass, a, bar, exam, standardized, tests, are, also, used, in, certain, countries, to, regulate, immigration, for, example, intended, immigrants, to, australia, are, legally, required, to, pass, a, citizenship, test, as, part, of, that, country, s, naturalization, process, when, analyzed, in, the, context, of, language, texting, in, the, naturalization, processes, the, ideology, can, be, found, from, two, distinct, but, nearly, related, points, one, refers, to, the, construction, and, deconstruction, of, the, nation, s, constitutive, elements, that, makes, their, own, identity, while, the, second, has, a, more, restricted, view, of, the, notion, of, specific, language, and, ideologies, that, may, served, in, a, specific, purpose, tests, are, sometimes, used, as, a, tool, to, select, for, participants, that, have, potential, to, succeed, in, a, competition, such, as, a, sporting, event, for, example, skaters, who, wish, to, participate, in, figure, skating, competitions, in, the, united, states, must, pass, official, u, s, figure, skating, tests, just, to, qualify, tests, are, sometimes, used, by, a, group, to, select, for, certain, types, of, individuals, to, join, the, group, for, example, mensa, international, is, a, high, iq, society, that, requires, individuals, to, score, at, the, 98th, percentile, or, higher, on, a, standardized, supervised, iq, test, assessment, types, include, criterion, referenced, tests, are, designed, to, measure, student, performance, against, a, fixed, set, of, criteria, or, learning, standards, it, is, possible, for, all, test, takers, to, pass, just, like, it, is, possible, for, all, test, takers, to, fail, these, tests, can, use, individual, s, scores, to, focus, on, improving, the, skills, that, were, lacking, in, comprehension, competitive, exams, are, norm, referenced, high, stakes, tests, in, which, candidates, are, ranked, according, to, their, grades, and, or, percentile, and, then, top, rankers, are, selected, if, the, examination, is, open, for, n, positions, then, the, first, n, candidates, in, ranks, pass, the, others, are, rejected, they, are, used, as, entrance, examinations, for, university, and, college, admissions, such, as, the, joint, entrance, examination, or, to, secondary,

competitive, examinations, are, considered, an, egalitarian, way, to, select, worthy, applicants, without, risking, influence, peddling, bias, or, other, concerns, a, single, test, can, have, multiple, qualities, for, example, the, bar, exam, for, aspiring, lawyers, may, be, a, norm, referenced, standardized, summative, assessment, this, means, that, only, the, test, takers, with, higher, scores, will, pass, that, all, of, them, took, the, same, test, under, the, same, circumstances, and, were, graded, with, the, same, scoring, standards, and, that, the, test, is, meant, to, determine, whether, the, law, school, graduates, have, learned, enough, to, practice, their, profession, written, tests, are, tests, that, are, administered, on, paper, or, on, a, computer, as, an, eexam, a, test, taker, who, takes, a, written, test, could, respond, to, specific, test, items, by, writing, or, typing, within, a, given, space, of, the, test, or, on, a, separate, form, or, document, in, some, tests, where, knowledge, of, many, constants, or, technical, terms, is, required, to, effectively, answer, questions, like, chemistry, or, biology, the, test, developer, may, allow, every, test, taker, to, bring, with, them, a, cheat, sheet, a, test, developer, s, choice, of, which, style, or, format, to, use, when, developing, a, written, test, is, usually, arbitrary, given, that, there, is, no, single, invariant, standard, for, testing, be, that, as, it, may, certain, test, styles, and, formats, have, become, more, widely, used, than, others, below, is, a, list, of, those, formats, of, test, items, that, are, widely, used, by, educators, and, test, developers, to, construct, paper, or, computer, based, tests, as, a, result, these, tests, may, consist, of, only, one, type, of, test, item, format, e, g, multiple, choice, test, essay, test, or, may, have, a, combination, of, different, test, item, formats, e, g, a, test, that, has, multiple, choice, and, essay, items, in, a, test, that, has, items, formatted, as, multiple, choice, questions, a, candidate, would, be, given, a, number, of, set, answers, for, each, question, and, the, candidate, must, choose, which, answer, or, group, of, answers, is, correct, there, are, two, families, of, multiple, choice, questions, the, first, family, is, known, as, the, true, false, question, and, it, requires, a, test, taker, to, choose, all, answers, that, are, appropriate, the, second, family, is, known, as, one, best, answer, question, and, it, requires, a, test, taker, to, answer, only, one, from, a, list, of, answers, there, are, several, reasons, to, using, multiple, choice, questions, in, tests, in, terms, of, administration, multiple, choice, questions, usually, requires, less, time, for, test, takers, to, answer, are, easy, to, score, and, grade, provide, greater, coverage, of, material, allows, for, a, wide, range, of, difficulty, and, can, easily, diagnose, a, test, taker, s, difficulty, with, certain, concepts, as, an, educational, tool, multiple, choice, items, test, many, levels, of, learning, as, well, as, a, test, taker, s, ability, to, integrate, information, and, it, provides, feedback, to, the, test, taker, about, why, distractors, were, wrong, and, why, correct, answers, were, right, nevertheless, there, are, difficulties, associated, with, the, use, of, multiple, choice, questions, in, administrative, terms, multiple, choice, items, that, are, effective, usually, take, a, great, time, to, construct, as, an, educational, tool, multiple, choice, items, do, not, allow, test, takers, to, demonstrate, knowledge, beyond, the, choices, provided, and, may, even, encourage, guessing, or, approximation, due, to, the, presence, of, at, least, one, correct, answer, for, instance, a, test, taker, might, not, work, out, explicitly, that, 6, 14, 7, 95, 48, 813, displaystyle, 6, 14, cdot, 7, 95, 48, 813, but, knowing, that, 6, 8, 48, displaystyle, 6, cdot, 8, 48, they, would, choose, an, answer, close, to, 48, moreover, test, takers, may, misinterpret, these, items, and, in, the, process, perceive, these, items, to, be, tricky, or, picky, finally, multiple, choice, items, do, not, test, a, test, taker, s, attitudes, towards, learning, because, correct, responses, can, be, easily, faked, true, false, questions, present, candidates, with, a, binary, choice, a, statement, is, either, true, or, false, this, method, presents, problems, as, depending, on, the, number, of, questions, a, significant, number, of, candidates, could, get, 100, just, by, guesswork, and, should, on, average, get, 50, a, matching, item, is, an, item, that, provides, a, defined, term, and, requires, a, test, taker, to, match, identifying, characteristics, to, the, correct, term, a, fill, in, the, blank, item, provides, a, test, taker, with, identifying, characteristics, and, requires, the, test, taker, to, recall, the, correct, term, there, are, two, types, of, fill, in, the, blank, tests, the, easier, version, provides, a, word, bank, of, possible, words, that, will, fill, in, the, blanks, for, some, exams, all, words, in, the, word, bank, are, used, exactly, once, if, a, teacher, wanted, to, create, a, test, of, medium, difficulty, they, would, provide, a, test, with, a, word, bank, but, some, words, may, be, used, more, than, once, and, others, not, at, all, the, hardest, variety, of, such, a, test, is, a, fill, in, the, blank, test, in, which, no, word, bank, is, provided, at, all, this, generally, requires, a, higher, level, of, understanding, and, memory, than, a, multiple, choice, test, because, of, this, fill, in, the, blank, tests, with, no, word, bank, are, often, feared, by, students, items, such, as, short, answer, or, essay, typically, require, a, test, taker, to, write, a, response, to, fulfill, the, requirements, of, the, item, in, administrative, terms, essay, items, take, less, time, to, construct, as, an, assessment, tool, essay, items, can, test, complex, learning, objectives, as, well, as, processes, used, to, answer, the, question, the, items, can, also, provide, a, more, realistic, and, generalizable, task, for, test, finally, these, items, make, it, difficult, for, test, takers, to, guess, the, correct, answers, and, require, test, takers, to, demonstrate, their, writing, skills, as, well, as, correct, spelling, and, grammar, the, difficulties, with, essay, items, are, primarily, administrative, for, example, test, takers, require, adequate, time, to, be, able, to, compose, their, answers, when, these, questions, are, answered, the, answers, themselves, are, usually, poorly, written, because, test, takers, may, not, have, time, to, organize, and, proofread, their, answers, in, turn, it, takes, more, time, to, score, or, grade, these, items, when, these, items, are, being, scored, or, graded, the, grading, process, itself, becomes, subjective, as, non, test, related, information, may, influence, the, process, thus, considerable, effort, is, required, to, minimize, the, subjectivity, of, the, grading, process, finally, as, an, assessment, tool, essay, questions, may, potentially, be, unreliable, in, assessing, the, entire, content, of, a, subject, matter, instructions, to, exam, candidates, rely, on, the, use, of, command, words, which, direct, the, examinee, to, respond, in, a, particular, way, for, example, by, describing, or, defining, a, concept, or, comparing, and, contrasting, two, or, more, scenarios, or, events, some, command, words, require, more, insight, or, skill, than, others, for, example, analyse, and, synthesise, assess, higher, level, skills, than, describe, more, demanding, command, words, usually, attract, greater, mark, weighting, in, the, examination, in, the, uk, ofqual, maintains, an, official, list, of, command, words, explaining, their, meaning, the, welsh, government, s, guidance, on, the, use, of, command, words, advises, that, they, should, be, used, consistently, and, correctly, but, notes, that, some, subjects, have, their, own, traditions, and, expectations, in, regard, to, candidates, responses, and, cambridge, assessment, notes, that, in, some, cases, subject, specific, command, words, may, be, in, used, a, quiz, is, a, brief, assessment, which, may, cover, a, small, amount, of, material, that, was, given, in, a, class, some, of, them, cover, two, to, three, lectures, that, were, given, in, a, period, of, times, as, a, reading, section, or, a, given, exercise, in, were, the, most, important, part, of, the, class, was, summarize, however, a, simple, quiz, usually, does, not, count, very, much, and, instructors, usually, provide, this, type, of, test, as, a, formative, assessment, to, help, determine, whether, the, student, is, learning, the, material, in, addition, doing, this, at, the, time, the, instructor, collected, all, can, make, a, significant, part, of, the, final, course, grade, most, mathematics, questions, or, calculation, questions, from, subjects, such, as, chemistry, physics, or, economics, employ, a, style, which, does, not, fall, into, any, of, the, above, categories, although, some, papers, notably, the, maths, challenge, papers, in, the, united, kingdom, employ, multiple, choice, instead, most, mathematics, questions, state, a, mathematical, problem, or, exercise, that, requires, a, student, to, write, a, freehand, response, marks, are, given, more, for, the, steps, taken, than, for, the, correct, answer, if, the, question, has, multiple, parts, later, parts, may, use, answers, from, previous, sections, and, marks, may, be, granted, if, an, earlier, incorrect, answer, was, used, but, the, correct, method, was, followed, and, an, answer, which, is, correct, given, the, incorrect, input, is, returned, higher, level, mathematical, papers, may, include, variations, on, true, false, where, the, candidate, is, given, a, statement, and, asked, to, verify, its, validity, by, direct, proof, or, stating, a, counterexample, though, not, as, popular, as, the, closed, book, test, open, book, or, open, note, tests, are, slowly, rising, in, popularity, an, open, book, test, allows, the, test, taker, to, access, textbooks, and, all, of, their, notes, while, taking, the, test, the, questions, asked, on, open, book, exams, are, typically, more, thought, provoking, and, intellectual, than, questions, on, a, closed, book, exam, rather, than, testing, what, facts, test, takers, know, open, book, exams, force, them, to, apply, the, facts, to, a, broader, question, the, main, benefit, that, is, seen, from, open, book, tests, is, that, they, are, a, better, preparation, for, the, real, world, where, one, does, not, have, to, memorize, and, has, anything, they, need, at, their, disposal, an, oral, test, is, a, test, that, is, answered, orally, verbally, the, teacher, or, oral, test, assessor, will, verbally, ask, a, question, to, a, student, who, will, then, answer, it, using, words, a, physical, fitness, test, is, a, test, designed, to, measure, physical, strength, agility, and, endurance, they, are, commonly, employed, in, educational, institutions, as, part, of, the, physical, education, curriculum, in, medicine, as, part, of, diagnostic, testing, and, as, eligibility, requirements, in, fields, that, focus, on, physical, ability, such, as, military, or, police, throughout, the, 20th, century, scientific, evidence, emerged, demonstrating, the, usefulness, of, strength, training, and, aerobic, exercise, in, maintaining, overall, health, and, more, agencies, began, to, incorporate, standardized, fitness, testing, in, the, united, states, the, president, s, council, on, youth, fitness, was, established, in, 1956, as, a, way, to, encourage, and, monitor, fitness, in, schoolchildren, common, tests, include, timed, running, or, the, multi, stage, fitness, test, commonly, known, as, the, beep, test, and, numbers, of, push, ups, sit, ups, abdominal, crunches, and, pull, ups, that, the, individual, can, perform, more, specialised, tests, may, be, used, to, test, ability, to, perform, a, particular, job, or, role, many, gyms, private, organisations, and, event, organizers, have, their, own, fitness, tests, using, military, techniques, developed, by, the, british, army, and, modern, test, like, illinois, agility, run, and, cooper, test, stop, watch, timing, was, common, until, recent, years, when, hand, timing, had, proven, to, be, inaccurate, and, inconsistent, electronic, timing, is, the, new, standard, in, order, to, promote, accuracy, and, consistency, and, lessen, bias, a, performance, test, is, an, assessment, that, requires, an, examinee, to, actually, perform, a, task, or, activity, rather, than, simply, answering, questions, referring, to, specific, parts, the, purpose, is, to, ensure, greater, fidelity, to, what, is, being, tested, an, example, is, a, behind, the, wheel, driving, test, to, obtain, a, driver, s, license, rather, than, only, answering, simple, multiple, choice, items, regarding, the, driving, of, an, automobile, a, student, is, required, to, actually, drive, one, while, being, evaluated, performance, tests, are, commonly, used, in, workplace, and, professional, applications, such, as, professional, certification, and, licensure, when, used, for, personnel, selection, the, tests, might, be, referred, to, as, a, work, sample, a, licensure, example, would, be, cosmetologists, being, required, to, demonstrate, a, haircut, or, manicure, on, a, live, person, the, group, bourdon, test, is, one, of, a, number, of, psychometric, tests, which, trainee, train, drivers, in, the, uk, are, required, to, pass, some, performance, tests, are, simulations, for, instance, the, assessment, to, become, certified, as, an, ophthalmic, technician, includes, two, components, a, multiple, choice, examination, and, a, computerized, skill, simulation, the, examinee, must, demonstrate, the, ability, to, complete, seven, tasks, commonly, performed, on, the, job, such, as, retinoscopy, that, are, simulated, on, a, computer, a, midterm, exam, is, an, exam, given, near, the, middle, of, an, academic, grading, term, or, near, the, middle, of, any, given, quarter, or, semester, midterm, exams, are, a, type, of, formative, or, summative, assessment, a, final, examination, annual, exam, final, interview, or, simply, final, is, a, test, given, to, students, at, the, end, of, a, course, of, study, or, training, although, the, term, can, be, used, in, the, context, of, physical, training, it, most, often, occurs, in, the, academic, world, most, high, schools, colleges, and, universities, run, final, exams, at, the, end, of, a, particular, academic, term, typically, a, quarter, or, semester, or, more, traditionally, at, the, end, of, a, complete, degree, course, the, purpose, of, the, test, is, to, make, a, final, review, of, the, topics, covered, and, assessment, of, each, student, s, knowledge, of, the, subject, a, final, is, technically, just, a, greater, form, of, a, unit, test, they, have, the, same, purpose, finals, are, simply, larger, not, all, courses, or, curricula, culminate, in, a, final, exam, instructors, may, assign, a, term, paper, or, final, project, in, some, courses, the, weighting, of, the, final, exam, also, varies, it, may, be, the, largest, or, only, factor, in, the, student, s, course, grade, in, other, cases, it, may, carry, the, same, weight, as, a, midterm, exam, or, the, student, may, be, exempted, not, all, finals, need, be, cumulative, however, as, some, simply, cover, the, material, presented, since, the, last, exam, for, example, a, microbiology, course, might, only, cover, fungi, and, parasites, on, the, final, exam, if, this, were, the, policy, of, the, professor, and, all, other, subjects, presented, in, the, course, would, then, not, be, tested, on, the, final, exam, prior, to, the, examination, period, most, students, in, the, commonwealth, have, a, week, or, so, of, intense, revision, and, study, known, as, swotvac, in, the, uk, most, universities, hold, a, single, set, of, finals, at, the, end, of, the, entire, degree, course, in, australia, the, exam, period, varies, with, high, schools, commonly, assigning, one, or, two, weeks, for, final, exams, but, the, university, period, sometimes, called, exam, week, or, just, exams, may, stretch, to, a, maximum, of, three, weeks, practice, varies, widely, in, the, united, states, finals, or, the, finals, period, at, the, university, level, constitutes, two, or, three, weeks, after, the, end, of, the, academic, term, but, sometimes, exams, are, administered, in, the, last, week, of, instruction, some, institutions, designate, a, study, week, or, reading, period, between, the, end, of, instruction, and, the, beginning, of, finals, during, which, no, examinations, may, be, administered, students, at, many, institutions, know, the, week, before, finals, as, dead, week, most, final, exams, incorporate, the, reading, material, that, has, been, assigned, throughout, the, term, though, common, in, french, tertiary, institutions, final, exams, are, not, often, assigned, in, french, high, schools, however, french, high, school, students, hoping, to, continue, their, studies, at, university, level, will, sit, a, national, exam, known, as, the, baccalaur, at, in, some, countries, and, locales, that, hold, standardised, exams, it, is, customary, for, schools, to, administer, mock, examinations, with, formats, modelling, the, real, exam, students, from, different, schools, are, often, seen, exchanging, mock, papers, as, a, means, of, test, preparation, a, take, home, final, is, an, examination, at, the, end, of, an, academic, term, that, is, usually, too, long, or, complex, to, be, completed, in, a, single, session, as, an, in, class, final, there, is, usually, a, deadline, for, completion, such, as, within, one, or, two, weeks, of, the, end, of, the, semester, a, take, home, final, differs, from, a, final, paper, often, involving, research, extended, texts, and, display, of, data, in, some, cases, schools, will, run, on, a, modified, schedule, for, final, exams, to, allow, students, more, time, to, do, their, exams, however, this, is, not, necessarily, the, case, for, every, institution, from, the, perspective, of, a, test, developer, there, is, great, variability, with, respect, to, time, and, effort, needed, to, prepare, a, test, likewise, from, the, perspective, of, a, test, taker, there, is, also, great, variability, with, respect, to, the, time, and, effort, needed, to, obtain, a, desired, grade, or, score, on, any, given, test, when, a, test, developer, constructs, a, test, the, amount, of, time, and, effort, is, dependent, upon, the, significance, of, the, test, itself, the, proficiency, of, the, test, taker, the, format, of, the, test, class, size, deadline, of, the, test, and, experience, of, the, test, developer, the, process, of, test, construction, has, been, aided, in, several, ways, for, one, many, test, developers, were, themselves, students, at, one, time, and, therefore, are, able, to, modify, or, outright, adopt, questions, from, their, previous, tests, in, some, countries, book, publishers, often, provide, teaching, packages, that, include, test, banks, to, university, instructors, who, adopt, their, published, books, for, their, courses, these, test, banks, may, contain, up, to, four, thousand, sample, test, questions, that, have, been, peer, reviewed, and, time, tested, the, instructor, who, chooses, to, use, this, testbank, would, only, have, to, select, a, fixed, number, of, test, questions, from, this, test, bank, to, construct, a, test, as, with, test, constructions, the, time, needed, for, a, test, taker, to, prepare, for, a, test, is, dependent, upon, the, frequency, of, the, test, the, test, developer, and, the, significance, of, the, test, in, general, nonstandardized, tests, that, are, short, frequent, and, do, not, constitute, a, major, portion, of, the, test, taker, s, overall, course, grade, or, score, do, not, require, the, test, taker, to, spend, much, time, preparing, for, the, test, conversely, nonstandardized, tests, that, are, long, infrequent, and, do, constitute, a, major, portion, of, the, test, taker, s, overall, course, grade, or, score, usually, require, the, test, taker, to, spend, great, amounts, of, time, preparing, for, the, test, to, prepare, for, a, nonstandardized, test, test, takers, may, rely, upon, their, reference, books, class, or, lecture, notes, internet, and, past, experience, test, takers, may, also, use, various, learning, aids, to, study, for, tests, such, as, flashcards, and, mnemonics, test, takers, may, even, hire, tutors, to, coach, them, through, the, process, so, that, they, may, increase, the, probability, of, obtaining, a, desired, test, grade, or, score, in, countries, such, as, the, united, kingdom, demand, for, private, tuition, has, increased, significantly, in, recent, years, finally, test, takers, may, rely, upon, past, copies, of, a, test, from, previous, years, or, semesters, to, study, for, a, future, test, these, past, tests, may, be, provided, by, a, friend, or, a, group, that, has, copies, of, previous, tests, or, by, instructors, and, their, institutions, or, by, the, test, provider, such, as, an, examination, board, itself, unlike, a, nonstandardized, test, the, time, needed, by, test, takers, to, prepare, for, standardized, tests, is, less, variable, and, usually, considerable, this, is, because, standardized, tests, are, usually, uniform, in, scope, format, and, difficulty, and, often, have, important, consequences, with, respect, to, a, test, taker, s, future, such, as, a, test, taker, s, eligibility, to, attend, a, specific, university, program, or, to, enter, a, desired, profession, it, is, not, unusual, for, test, takers, to, prepare, for, standardized, tests, by, relying, upon, commercially, available, books, that, provide, in, depth, coverage, of, the, standardized, test, or, compilations, of, previous, tests, e, g, ten, year, series, in, singapore, in, many, countries, test, takers, even, enroll, in, test, preparation, centers, or, cram, schools, that, provide, extensive, or, supplementary, instructions, to, test, takers, to, help, them, better, prepare, for, a, standardized, test, in, hong, kong, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, tutors, running, such, centers, are, celebrities, in, their, own, right, this, has, led, to, private, tuition, being, a, popular, career, choice, for, new, graduates, in, developed, economies, finally, in, some, countries, instructors, and, their, institutions, have, also, played, a, significant, role, in, preparing, test, takers, for, a, standardized, test, cheating, on, a, test, is, the, process, of, using, unauthorized, means, or, methods, to, obtain, a, desired, test, score, or, grade, this, may, range, from, bringing, and, using, notes, during, a, closed, book, examination, to, copying, another, test, taker, s, answer, or, choice, of, answers, during, an, individual, test, to, sending, a, paid, proxy, to, take, the, test, several, common, methods, have, been, employed, to, combat, cheating, they, include, the, use, of, multiple, proctors, or, invigilators, during, a, testing, period, to, monitor, test, takers, test, developers, may, construct, multiple, variants, of, the, same, test, to, be, administered, to, different, test, takers, at, the, same, time, or, write, tests, with, few, multiple, choice, options, based, on, the, theory, that, fully, worked, answers, are, difficult, to, imitate, in, some, cases, instructors, themselves, may, not, administer, their, own, tests, but, will, leave, the, task, to, other, instructors, or, invigilators, which, may, mean, that, the, invigilators, do, not, know, the, candidates, and, thus, some, form, of, identification, may, be, required, finally, instructors, or, test, providers, may, compare, the, answers, of, suspected, cheaters, on, the, test, themselves, to, determine, whether, cheating, did, occur
