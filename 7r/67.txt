forestry, is, the, science, and, craft, of, creating, managing, planting, using, conserving, and, repairing, forests, and, woodlands, for, associated, resources, for, human, and, environmental, benefits, forestry, is, practiced, in, plantations, and, natural, stands, the, science, of, forestry, has, elements, that, belong, to, the, biological, physical, social, political, and, managerial, sciences, forest, management, plays, an, essential, role, in, the, creation, and, modification, of, habitats, and, affects, ecosystem, services, provisioning, modern, forestry, generally, embraces, a, broad, range, of, concerns, in, what, is, known, as, multiple, use, management, including, the, provision, of, timber, fuel, wood, wildlife, habitat, natural, water, quality, management, recreation, landscape, and, community, protection, employment, aesthetically, appealing, landscapes, biodiversity, management, watershed, management, erosion, control, and, preserving, forests, as, sinks, for, atmospheric, carbon, dioxide, forest, ecosystems, have, come, to, be, seen, as, the, most, important, component, of, the, biosphere, and, forestry, has, emerged, as, a, vital, applied, science, craft, and, technology, a, practitioner, of, forestry, is, known, as, a, forester, another, common, term, is, silviculturist, silviculture, is, narrower, than, forestry, being, concerned, only, with, forest, plants, but, is, often, used, synonymously, with, forestry, all, people, depend, upon, forests, and, their, biodiversity, some, more, than, others, forestry, is, an, important, economic, segment, in, various, industrial, countries, as, forests, provide, more, than, 86, million, green, jobs, and, support, the, livelihoods, of, many, more, people, for, example, in, germany, forests, cover, nearly, a, third, of, the, land, area, wood, is, the, most, important, renewable, resource, and, forestry, supports, more, than, a, million, jobs, and, about, 181, billion, of, value, to, the, german, economy, each, year, worldwide, an, estimated, 880, million, people, spend, part, of, their, time, collecting, fuelwood, or, producing, charcoal, many, of, them, women, human, populations, tend, to, be, low, in, areas, of, low, income, countries, with, high, forest, cover, and, high, forest, biodiversity, but, poverty, rates, in, these, areas, tend, to, be, high, some, 252, million, people, living, in, forests, and, savannahs, have, incomes, of, less, than, us, 1, 25, per, day, over, the, past, centuries, forestry, was, regarded, as, a, separate, science, with, the, rise, of, ecology, and, environmental, science, there, has, been, a, reordering, in, the, applied, sciences, in, line, with, this, view, forestry, is, a, primary, land, use, science, comparable, with, agriculture, under, these, headings, the, fundamentals, behind, the, management, of, natural, forests, comes, by, way, of, natural, ecology, forests, or, tree, plantations, those, whose, primary, purpose, is, the, extraction, of, forest, products, are, planned, and, managed, to, utilize, a, mix, of, ecological, and, agroecological, principles, in, many, regions, of, the, world, there, is, considerable, conflict, between, forest, practices, and, other, societal, priorities, such, as, water, quality, watershed, preservation, sustainable, fishing, conservation, and, species, preservation, silvology, latin, silva, or, sylva, forests, and, woods, ancient, greek, logia, science, of, or, study, of, is, the, biological, science, of, studying, forests, and, woodlands, incorporating, the, understanding, of, natural, forest, ecosystems, and, the, effects, and, development, of, silvicultural, practices, the, term, complements, silviculture, which, deals, with, the, art, and, practice, of, forest, management, silvology, is, seen, as, a, single, science, for, forestry, and, was, first, used, by, professor, roelof, a, a, oldeman, at, wageningen, university, it, integrates, the, study, of, forests, and, forest, ecology, dealing, with, single, tree, autecology, and, natural, forest, ecology, dendrology, ancient, greek, dendron, tree, and, ancient, greek, logia, science, of, or, study, of, or, xylology, ancient, greek, ksulon, wood, is, the, science, and, study, of, woody, plants, trees, shrubs, and, lianas, specifically, their, taxonomic, classifications, there, is, no, sharp, boundary, between, plant, taxonomy, and, dendrology, woody, plants, not, only, belong, to, many, different, plant, families, but, these, families, may, be, made, up, of, both, woody, and, non, woody, members, some, families, include, only, a, few, woody, species, dendrology, as, a, discipline, of, industrial, forestry, tends, to, focus, on, identification, of, economically, useful, woody, plants, and, their, taxonomic, interrelationships, as, an, academic, course, of, study, dendrology, will, include, all, woody, plants, native, and, non, native, that, occur, in, a, region, a, related, discipline, is, the, study, of, sylvics, which, focuses, on, the, autecology, of, genera, and, species, the, provenance, of, forest, reproductive, material, used, to, plant, forests, has, a, great, influence, on, how, the, trees, develop, hence, why, it, is, important, to, use, forest, reproductive, material, of, good, quality, and, of, high, genetic, diversity, more, generally, all, forest, management, practices, including, in, natural, regeneration, systems, may, impact, the, genetic, diversity, of, trees, the, term, genetic, diversity, describes, the, differences, in, dna, sequence, between, individuals, as, distinct, from, variation, caused, by, environmental, influences, the, unique, genetic, composition, of, an, individual, its, genotype, will, determine, its, performance, its, phenotype, at, a, particular, site, genetic, diversity, is, needed, to, maintain, the, vitality, of, forests, and, to, provide, resilience, to, pests, and, diseases, genetic, diversity, also, ensures, that, forest, trees, can, survive, adapt, and, evolve, under, changing, environmental, conditions, furthermore, genetic, diversity, is, the, foundation, of, biological, diversity, at, species, and, ecosystem, levels, forest, genetic, resources, are, therefore, important, to, consider, in, forest, management, genetic, diversity, in, forests, is, threatened, by, forest, fires, pests, and, diseases, habitat, fragmentation, poor, silvicultural, practices, and, inappropriate, use, of, forest, reproductive, material, about, 98, million, hectares, of, forest, were, affected, by, fire, in, 2015, this, was, mainly, in, the, tropical, domain, where, fire, burned, about, 4, percent, of, the, total, forest, area, in, that, year, more, than, two, thirds, of, the, total, forest, area, affected, was, in, africa, and, south, america, insects, diseases, and, severe, weather, events, damaged, about, 40, million, hectares, of, forests, in, 2015, mainly, in, the, temperate, and, boreal, domains, furthermore, the, marginal, populations, of, many, tree, species, are, facing, new, threats, due, to, the, effects, of, climate, change, most, countries, in, europe, have, recommendations, or, guidelines, for, selecting, species, and, provenances, that, can, be, used, in, a, given, site, or, zone, forest, management, is, a, branch, of, forestry, concerned, with, overall, administrative, legal, economic, and, social, aspects, as, well, as, scientific, and, technical, aspects, such, as, silviculture, forest, protection, and, forest, regulation, this, includes, management, for, timber, aesthetics, recreation, urban, values, water, wildlife, inland, and, nearshore, fisheries, wood, products, plant, genetic, resources, and, other, forest, resource, values, management, objectives, can, be, for, conservation, utilisation, or, a, mixture, of, the, two, techniques, include, timber, extraction, planting, and, replanting, of, different, species, building, and, maintenance, of, roads, and, pathways, through, forests, and, preventing, fire, the, first, dedicated, forestry, school, was, established, by, georg, ludwig, hartig, at, hungen, in, the, wetterau, hesse, in, 1787, though, forestry, had, been, taught, earlier, in, central, europe, including, at, the, university, of, giessen, in, hesse, darmstadt, in, spain, the, first, forestry, school, was, the, forest, engineering, school, of, madrid, escuela, t, cnica, superior, de, ingenieros, de, montes, founded, in, 1844, the, first, in, north, america, the, biltmore, forest, school, was, established, near, asheville, north, carolina, by, carl, a, schenck, on, september, 1, 1898, on, the, grounds, of, george, w, vanderbilt, s, biltmore, estate, another, early, school, was, the, new, york, state, college, of, forestry, established, at, cornell, university, just, a, few, weeks, later, in, september, 1898, early, 19th, century, north, american, foresters, went, to, germany, to, study, forestry, some, early, german, foresters, also, emigrated, to, north, america, in, south, america, the, first, forestry, school, was, established, in, brazil, in, vi, osa, minas, gerais, in, 1962, and, moved, the, next, year, to, become, a, faculty, at, the, federal, university, of, paran, in, curitiba, today, forestry, education, typically, includes, training, in, general, biology, ecology, botany, genetics, soil, science, climatology, hydrology, economics, and, forest, management, education, in, the, basics, of, sociology, and, political, science, is, often, considered, an, advantage, professional, skills, in, conflict, resolution, and, communication, are, also, important, in, training, programs, in, india, forestry, education, is, imparted, in, the, agricultural, universities, and, in, forest, research, institutes, deemed, universities, four, year, degree, programmes, are, conducted, in, these, universities, at, the, undergraduate, level, masters, and, doctorate, degrees, are, also, available, in, these, universities, in, the, united, states, postsecondary, forestry, education, leading, to, a, bachelor, s, degree, or, master, s, degree, is, accredited, by, the, society, of, american, foresters, in, canada, the, canadian, institute, of, forestry, awards, silver, rings, to, graduates, from, accredited, university, bsc, programs, as, well, as, college, and, technical, programs, in, many, european, countries, training, in, forestry, is, made, in, accordance, with, requirements, of, the, bologna, process, and, the, european, higher, education, area, the, international, union, of, forest, research, organizations, is, the, only, international, organization, that, coordinates, forest, science, efforts, worldwide, in, order, to, keep, up, with, changing, demands, and, environmental, factors, forestry, education, does, not, stop, at, graduation, increasingly, forestry, professionals, engage, in, regular, training, to, maintain, and, improve, on, their, management, practices, an, increasingly, popular, tool, are, marteloscopes, one, hectare, large, rectangular, forest, sites, where, all, trees, are, numbered, mapped, and, recorded, these, sites, can, be, used, to, do, virtual, thinnings, and, test, one, s, wood, quality, and, volume, estimations, as, well, as, tree, microhabitats, this, system, is, mainly, suitable, to, regions, with, small, scale, multi, functional, forest, management, systems, forestry, literature, is, the, books, journals, and, other, publications, about, forestry, the, first, major, works, about, forestry, in, the, english, language, included, roger, taverner, s, booke, of, survey, 1565, john, manwood, s, a, brefe, collection, of, the, lawes, of, the, forrest, 1592, and, john, evelyn, s, sylva, 1662, this, article,
