responsiveness, to, customers, de, meuse, et, al, 1997, p, 168, however, some, writers, draw, attention, to, the, obsessive, pursuit, of, downsizing, to, the, point, of, self, starvation, marked, by, excessive, cost, cutting, organ, failure, and, extreme, pathological, fear, of, becoming, inefficient, hence, trimming, and, tightening, belts, are, the, order, of, the, day, traditionally, layoffs, directly, affect, the, employee, however, the, employee, terminated, is, not, alone, in, this, layoffs, affect, the, workplace, environment, and, the, economy, as, well, as, the, employee, layoffs, have, a, widespread, effect, and, the, three, main, components, of, layoff, effects, are, in, the, workplace, to, the, employee, and, effects, to, the, economy, one, framework, to, examine, the, effects, on, the, macro, level, is, psb, which, examines, the, stakeholders, perspective, in, global, downsizing, this, framework, examines, the, global, perspective, of, positive, and, negative, stakeholders, behavior, during, downsizing, layoffs, have, remained, the, greatest, way, for, a, company, to, cut, costs, although, from, the, employer, s, perspective, a, layoff, is, beneficial, for, the, business, layoffs, create, an, uncertainty, in, the, workplace, environment, and, lowers, other, employees, job, security, as, well, as, creates, an, apprehension, and, fear, of, termination, for, the, remaining, employees, and, subsequently, lowers, overall, motivation, in, the, workplace, environment, according, to, healing, the, wounds, overcoming, the, trauma, of, layoffs, and, revitalizing, downsized, organizations, in, the, post, layoff, environment, there, is, a, need, for, empathy, tangibility, self, knowledge, and, relentlessly, seeking, customers, among, the, surviving, employees, the, remaining, employees, may, have, feelings, of, survivors, guilt, in, order, to, diminish, negative, effects, of, layoffs, wayne, cascio, suggests, alternative, approaches, to, layoff, and, downsizing, as, responsible, restructuring, approach, optimism, is, critical, for, rebuilding, the, workplace, environment, because, employees, look, to, their, leaders, for, stability, and, predictability, no, matter, the, position, in, an, organization, employees, will, look, for, job, security, employees, or, former, employees, in, this, case, can, be, affected, in, a, couple, of, different, ways, when, an, employee, is, laid, off, his, or, her, general, trust, in, long, term, work, may, decrease, reducing, expectations, upon, rehire, after, an, employee, withstands, a, layoff, the, effects, can, trickle, into, future, employment, and, attitudes, layoffs, in, the, workplace, often, leave, the, former, employee, less, inclined, to, trust, future, employers, which, can, lead, to, behavioral, conflicts, among, co, workers, and, management, despite, new, employers, not, being, responsible, for, a, prior, circumstances, job, performance, may, still, be, affected, by, prior, layoffs, many, companies, work, to, make, layoffs, as, minimally, burdensome, to, the, employee, at, times, employers, may, layoff, multiple, people, at, once, to, soften, the, impact, layoffs, create, lower, job, security, overall, and, an, increased, competitiveness, for, available, and, opening, positions, layoffs, have, generally, two, major, effects, on, the, economy, and, stockholders, the, way, layoffs, affect, the, economy, varies, from, the, industry, that, is, doing, the, layoffs, and, the, size, of, the, layoff, if, an, industry, that, employs, a, majority, of, a, region, freight, in, the, northeast, for, example, suffers, and, has, to, lay, employees, off, there, will, be, mass, unemployment, in, an, economically, rich, area, this, can, have, leave, ripple, effects, nationwide, unemployment, is, the, biggest, effect, on, the, economy, that, can, come, from, layoffs, in, francophone, belgium, the, term, proc, dure, renault, has, become, a, synonym, for, the, consultation, process, leading, to, mass, redundancies, due, to, a, controversial, mass, layoff, and, resultant, legislation, in, the, late, 1990s, when, an, employee, has, been, laid, off, in, australia, their, employer, has, to, give, them, redundancy, pay, which, is, also, known, as, severance, pay, the, only, time, that, a, redundancy, payment, doesn, t, have, to, be, paid, is, if, an, employee, is, casual, working, for, a, small, business, or, has, worked, for, a, business, for, less, than, twelve, months, the, redundancy, compensation, payment, for, employees, depends, on, the, length, of, time, an, employee, has, worked, for, an, employer, which, excludes, unpaid, leave, if, an, employer, can, t, afford, the, redundancy, payment, they, are,
