a, society, s, s, a, t, i, is, a, group, of, individuals, involved, in, persistent, social, interaction, or, a, large, social, group, sharing, the, same, spatial, or, social, territory, typically, subject, to, the, same, political, authority, and, dominant, cultural, expectations, societies, are, characterized, by, patterns, of, relationships, social, relations, between, individuals, who, share, a, distinctive, culture, and, institutions, a, given, society, may, be, described, as, the, sum, total, of, such, relationships, among, its, constituent, members, human, social, structures, are, complex, and, highly, cooperative, featuring, the, specialization, of, labor, via, social, roles, societies, construct, roles, and, other, patterns, of, behavior, by, deeming, certain, actions, or, concepts, acceptable, or, unacceptable, these, expectations, around, behavior, within, a, given, society, are, known, as, societal, norms, so, far, as, it, is, collaborative, a, society, can, enable, its, members, to, benefit, in, ways, that, would, otherwise, be, difficult, on, an, individual, basis, societies, vary, based, on, level, of, technology, and, type, of, economic, activity, larger, societies, with, larger, food, surpluses, often, exhibit, stratification, or, dominance, patterns, societies, can, have, many, different, forms, of, government, various, ways, of, understanding, kinship, and, different, gender, roles, human, behavior, varies, immensely, between, different, societies, humans, shape, society, but, society, in, turn, shapes, human, beings, the, term, society, often, refers, to, a, large, group, of, people, in, an, ordered, community, in, a, country, or, several, similar, countries, or, the, state, of, being, with, other, people, e, g, they, lived, in, medieval, society, the, term, dates, back, to, at, least, 1513, and, comes, from, the, 12th, century, french, societe, modern, french, soci, t, meaning, company, societe, was, in, turn, derived, from, the, latin, word, societas, fellowship, alliance, association, which, in, turn, was, derived, from, the, noun, socius, comrade, friend, ally, humans, along, with, their, closest, relatives, bonobos, and, chimpanzees, are, highly, social, animals, this, biological, context, suggests, that, the, underlying, sociability, required, for, the, formation, of, societies, is, hardwired, into, human, nature, human, society, features, high, degrees, of, cooperation, and, differs, in, important, ways, from, groups, of, chimps, and, bonobos, including, the, parental, role, of, males, the, use, of, language, to, communicate, the, specialization, of, labor, and, the, tendency, to, build, nests, multigenerational, camps, town, or, cities, some, biologists, including, entomologist, e, o, wilson, categorize, humans, as, eusocial, placing, humans, with, ants, in, the, highest, level, of, sociability, on, the, spectrum, of, animal, ethology, although, others, disagree, social, group, living, may, have, evolved, in, humans, due, to, group, selection, in, physical, environments, that, made, survival, difficult, in, western, sociology, there, are, three, dominant, paradigms, for, understanding, society, functionalism, also, known, as, structural, functionalism, conflict, theory, and, symbolic, interactionism, according, to, the, functionalist, school, of, thought, individuals, in, society, work, together, like, organs, in, the, body, to, create, emergent, behavior, sometimes, referred, to, as, collective, consciousness, 19th, century, sociologists, auguste, comte, and, mile, durkheim, for, example, believed, that, society, constitutes, a, separate, level, of, reality, distinct, from, both, biological, and, inorganic, matter, explanations, of, social, phenomena, had, therefore, to, be, constructed, within, this, level, individuals, being, merely, transient, occupants, of, comparatively, stable, social, roles, conflict, theorists, take, the, opposite, view, and, posit, that, individuals, and, social, groups, or, social, classes, within, society, interact, on, the, basis, of, conflict, rather, than, agreement, one, prominent, conflict, theorist, is, karl, marx, who, conceived, of, society, as, operating, on, an, economic, base, with, a, superstructure, of, government, family, religion, and, culture, marx, argues, that, the, economic, base, determines, the, superstructure, and, that, throughout, history, societal, change, has, been, driven, by, conflict, between, laborers, and, those, who, own, the, means, of, production, symbolic, interactionism, is, a, microsociological, theory, that, focuses, on, individuals, and, how, the, individual, relates, to, society, symbolic, interactionists, study, humans, use, of, shared, language, to, create, common, symbols, and, meanings, and, use, this, frame, of, reference, to, understand, how, individuals, interact, to, create, symbolic, worlds, and, in, turn, how, these, worlds, shape, individual, behaviors, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 20th, century, theorists, began, to, view, society, as, socially, constructed, in, this, vein, sociologist, peter, l, berger, describes, society, as, dialectic, society, is, created, by, humans, but, this, creation, turns, in, turn, creates, or, molds, humans, the, sociologic, emphasis, placed, on, functionalism, conflict, theory, and, symbolic, interactionism, has, been, criticized, as, eurocentric, the, malaysian, sociologist, syed, farid, al, attas, for, example, argues, that, western, thinkers, are, particularly, interested, in, the, implications, of, modernity, and, that, their, analysis, of, non, western, cultures, is, therefore, limited, in, scope, as, examples, of, nonwestern, thinkers, who, took, a, systematic, approach, to, understanding, society, al, attas, mentions, ibn, khaldun, 1332, 1406, and, jos, rizal, 1861, 1896, khaldun, an, arab, living, in, the, 14th, century, understood, society, along, with, the, rest, of, the, universe, as, having, meaningful, configuration, with, its, perceived, randomness, attributable, to, hidden, causes, khaldun, conceptualized, social, structures, as, having, two, fundamental, forms, nomadic, and, sedentary, nomadic, life, has, high, social, cohesion, asabijja, which, khaldun, argued, arose, from, kinship, shared, customs, and, a, shared, need, for, defense, sedentary, life, in, khaldun, s, view, was, marked, by, secularization, decreased, social, cohesion, and, increased, interest, in, luxury, rizal, was, a, filipino, nationalist, living, toward, the, end, of, the, spanish, colonial, period, who, theorized, about, colonial, societies, rizal, argued, that, indolence, which, the, spanish, used, to, justify, their, colonial, occupation, was, instead, caused, by, the, colonial, occupation, rizal, compared, the, pre, colonial, era, when, the, filipinos, controlled, trade, routes, and, had, higher, economic, activity, to, the, period, of, colonial, rule, and, argued, that, exploitation, economic, disorder, and, colonial, policies, that, discouraged, farming, led, to, a, decreased, interest, in, work, sociologists, tend, to, classify, societies, based, on, their, level, of, technology, and, place, societies, in, three, broad, categories, pre, industrial, industrial, and, postindustrial, subdivisions, of, these, categories, vary, and, classifications, are, often, based, on, level, of, technology, communication, and, economy, one, example, of, such, a, classification, comes, from, sociologist, gerhard, lenski, who, lists, 1, hunting, and, gathering, 2, horticultural, 3, agricultural, and, 4, industrial, as, well, as, specialized, societies, e, g, fishing, or, herding, some, cultures, have, developed, over, time, toward, more, complex, forms, of, organization, and, control, this, cultural, evolution, has, a, profound, effect, on, patterns, of, community, hunter, gatherer, tribes, have, at, times, settled, around, seasonal, food, stocks, to, become, agrarian, villages, villages, have, grown, to, become, towns, and, cities, cities, have, turned, into, city, states, and, nation, states, however, these, processes, are, not, unidirectional, in, a, pre, industrial, society, food, production, which, is, carried, out, through, the, use, of, human, and, animal, labor, is, the, main, economic, activity, these, societies, can, be, subdivided, according, to, their, level, of, technology, and, their, method, of, producing, food, these, subdivisions, are, hunting, and, gathering, pastoral, horticultural, and, agrarian, the, main, form, of, food, production, in, hunter, gatherer, societies, is, the, daily, collection, of, wild, plants, and, the, hunting, of, wild, animals, hunter, gatherers, move, around, constantly, in, search, of, food, as, a, result, they, do, not, build, permanent, villages, or, create, a, wide, variety, of, artifacts, the, need, for, mobility, also, limits, the, size, of, these, societies, and, they, usually, only, form, small, groups, such, as, bands, and, tribes, usually, with, fewer, than, 50, people, per, community, bands, and, tribes, are, relatively, egalitarian, and, decisions, are, reached, through, consensus, there, are, no, formal, political, offices, containing, real, power, in, band, societies, rather, a, chief, is, merely, a, person, of, influence, and, leadership, is, based, on, personal, qualities, the, family, forms, the, main, social, unit, with, most, members, being, related, by, birth, or, marriage, the, anthropologist, marshall, sahlins, described, hunter, gatherers, as, the, original, affluent, society, due, to, their, extended, leisure, time, sahlins, estimated, that, adults, in, hunter, gatherer, societies, work, three, to, five, hours, per, day, this, perspective, has, been, challenged, by, other, researchers, who, have, pointed, out, high, mortality, rates, and, perennial, warfare, in, hunter, gatherer, societies, proponents, of, sahlins, view, argue, that, the, general, well, being, of, humans, in, hunter, gatherer, societies, challenges, the, purported, relationship, between, technological, advancement, and, human, progress, rather, than, searching, for, food, on, a, daily, basis, members, of, a, pastoral, society, rely, on, domesticated, herd, animals, to, meet, their, food, needs, pastoralists, typically, live, a, nomadic, life, moving, their, herds, from, one, pasture, to, another, community, size, in, pastoral, societies, is, similar, to, hunter, gatherers, about, 50, individuals, but, unlike, hunter, gatherers, pastoral, societies, usually, consist, of, multiple, communities, the, average, pastoral, society, contains, thousands, of, people, this, is, because, pastoral, groups, tend, to, live, in, open, areas, where, movement, is, easy, which, enables, political, integration, pastoral, societies, tend, to, create, a, food, surplus, and, have, specialized, labor, and, high, levels, of, inequality, fruits, and, vegetables, grown, in, garden, plots, that, have, been, cleared, from, the, jungle, or, forest, provide, the, main, source, of, food, in, a, horticultural, society, these, societies, have, a, similar, level, of, technology, and, complexity, to, pastoral, societies, along, with, pastoral, societies, horticultural, societies, emerged, about, 10, 000, years, ago, after, technological, changes, of, the, agricultural, revolution, made, it, possible, to, cultivate, crops, and, raise, animals, horticulturists, use, human, labor, and, simple, tools, to, cultivate, the, land, for, one, or, more, seasons, when, the, land, becomes, barren, horticulturists, clear, a, new, plot, and, leave, the, old, plot, to, revert, to, its, natural, state, they, may, return, to, the, original, land, several, years, later, and, begin, the, process, again, by, rotating, their, garden, plots, horticulturists, can, stay, in, one, area, for, a, long, period, of, time, this, allows, them, to, build, permanent, or, semi, permanent, villages, as, with, pastoral, societies, surplus, food, leads, to, a, more, complex, division, of, labor, specialized, roles, in, horticultural, societies, include, craftspeople, shamans, religious, leaders, and, traders, this, role, specialization, allows, horticultural, societies, to, create, a, variety, of, artifacts, scarce, defensible, resources, can, lead, to, wealth, inequalities, in, horticultural, political, systems, agrarian, societies, use, agricultural, technological, advances, to, cultivate, crops, over, a, large, area, lenski, differentiates, between, horticultural, and, agrarian, societies, by, the, use, of, the, plow, larger, food, supplies, due, to, improved, technology, mean, agrarian, communities, are, larger, than, horticultural, communities, a, greater, food, surplus, results, in, towns, that, become, centers, of, trade, economic, trade, in, turn, leads, to, increased, specialization, including, a, ruling, class, as, well, as, educators, craftspeople, merchants, and, religious, figures, who, do, not, directly, participate, in, the, production, of, food, agrarian, societies, are, especially, noted, for, their, extremes, of, social, classes, and, rigid, social, mobility, as, land, is, the, major, source, of, wealth, social, hierarchy, develops, based, on, landownership, and, not, labor, the, system, of, stratification, is, characterized, by, three, coinciding, contrasts, governing, class, versus, the, masses, urban, minority, versus, peasant, majority, and, literate, minority, versus, illiterate, majority, this, results, in, two, distinct, subcultures, the, urban, elite, versus, the, peasant, masses, moreover, this, means, cultural, differences, within, agrarian, societies, are, greater, than, differences, between, them, the, landowning, strata, typically, combine, government, religious, and, military, institutions, to, justify, and, enforce, their, ownership, and, support, elaborate, patterns, of, consumption, slavery, serfdom, or, peonage, is, commonly, the, lot, of, the, primary, producer, rulers, of, agrarian, societies, often, do, not, manage, their, empire, for, the, common, good, or, in, the, name, of, the, public, interest, but, as, property, they, own, caste, systems, as, historically, found, in, south, asia, are, associated, with, agrarian, societies, where, lifelong, agricultural, routines, depend, upon, a, rigid, sense, of, duty, and, discipline, the, scholar, donald, brown, suggests, that, an, emphasis, in, the, modern, west, on, personal, liberties, and, freedoms, was, in, large, part, a, reaction, to, the, steep, and, rigid, stratification, of, agrarian, societies, industrial, societies, which, emerged, in, the, 18th, century, in, the, industrial, revolution, rely, heavily, on, machines, powered, by, external, sources, for, the, mass, production, of, goods, whereas, in, pre, industrial, societies, the, majority, of, labor, takes, place, in, primary, industries, focused, on, extracting, raw, materials, farming, fishing, mining, etc, in, industrial, societies, labor, is, mostly, focused, on, processing, raw, materials, into, finished, products, present, day, societies, vary, in, their, degree, of, industrialization, with, some, using, mostly, newer, energy, sources, e, g, coal, oil, and, nuclear, energy, and, others, continuing, to, rely, on, human, and, animal, power, industrialization, is, associated, with, population, booms, and, the, growth, of, cities, increased, productivity, as, well, as, the, stability, caused, by, improved, transportation, leads, to, decreased, mortality, and, resulting, population, growth, centralized, production, of, goods, in, factories, and, a, decreased, need, for, agricultural, labor, leads, to, urbanization, industrial, societies, are, often, capitalist, and, have, high, degrees, of, inequality, along, with, high, social, mobility, as, businesspeople, use, the, market, to, amass, large, amounts, of, wealth, working, conditions, in, factories, are, generally, restrictive, and, harsh, workers, who, have, common, interests, may, organize, into, labor, unions, to, advance, those, interests, on, the, whole, industrial, societies, are, marked, by, the, increased, power, of, human, beings, technological, advancements, mean, that, industrial, societies, have, increased, potential, for, deadly, warfare, governments, use, information, technologies, to, exert, greater, control, over, the, populace, industrial, societies, also, have, an, increased, environmental, impact, post, industrial, societies, are, societies, dominated, by, information, and, services, rather, than, the, production, of, goods, advanced, industrial, societies, see, a, shift, toward, an, increase, in, service, sectors, over, manufacturing, service, industries, include, education, health, and, finance, an, information, society, is, a, society, where, the, usage, creation, distribution, manipulation, and, integration, of, information, is, a, significant, activity, proponents, of, the, idea, that, modern, day, global, society, is, an, information, society, posit, that, information, technologies, are, impacting, most, important, forms, of, social, organization, including, education, economy, health, government, warfare, and, levels, of, democracy, although, the, concept, of, information, society, has, been, discussed, since, the, 1930s, in, the, present, day, it, is, almost, always, applied, to, ways, that, information, technologies, impact, society, and, culture, it, therefore, covers, the, effects, of, computers, and, telecommunications, on, the, home, the, workplace, schools, government, and, various, communities, and, organizations, as, well, as, the, emergence, of, new, social, forms, in, cyberspace, as, the, access, to, electronic, information, resources, increased, at, the, beginning, of, the, 21st, century, special, attention, was, extended, from, the, information, society, to, the, knowledge, society, a, knowledge, society, generates, shares, and, makes, available, to, all, members, of, the, society, knowledge, that, may, be, used, to, improve, the, human, condition, a, knowledge, society, differs, from, an, information, society, in, that, it, transforms, information, into, resources, that, allow, society, to, take, effective, action, rather, than, only, creating, and, disseminating, raw, data, social, norms, are, shared, standards, of, acceptable, behavior, by, groups, social, norms, which, can, both, be, informal, understandings, that, govern, the, behavior, of, members, of, a, society, as, well, as, be, codified, into, rules, and, laws, are, powerful, drivers, of, human, behavior, social, roles, are, norms, duties, and, patterns, of, behavior, that, relate, to, an, individual, s, social, status, in, functionalist, thought, individuals, form, the, structure, of, society, by, occupying, social, roles, according, to, symbolic, interactionism, individuals, use, symbols, to, navigate, and, communicate, roles, erving, goffman, used, the, metaphor, of, a, theater, to, develop, the, dramaturgical, lens, which, argues, that, roles, provide, scripts, that, govern, social, interactions, the, division, of, humans, into, male, and, female, gender, roles, has, been, marked, culturally, by, a, corresponding, division, of, norms, practices, dress, behavior, rights, duties, privileges, status, and, power, some, argue, that, gender, roles, arise, naturally, from, sex, differences, which, lead, to, a, division, of, labor, where, women, take, on, reproductive, labor, and, other, domestic, roles, gender, roles, have, varied, historically, and, challenges, to, predominant, gender, norms, have, recurred, in, many, societies, all, human, societies, organize, recognize, and, classify, types, of, social, relationships, based, on, relations, between, parents, children, and, other, descendants, consanguinity, and, relations, through, marriage, affinity, there, is, also, a, third, type, of, familial, relationship, applied, to, godparents, or, adoptive, children, fictive, these, culturally, defined, relationships, are, referred, to, as, kinship, in, many, societies, it, is, one, of, the, most, important, social, organizing, principles, and, plays, a, role, in, transmitting, status, and, inheritance, all, societies, have, rules, of, incest, taboo, according, to, which, marriage, between, certain, kinds, of, kin, relations, are, prohibited, and, some, societies, also, have, rules, of, preferential, marriage, with, certain, other, kin, relations, human, ethnic, groups, are, a, social, category, that, identify, together, as, a, group, based, on, shared, attributes, that, distinguish, them, from, other, groups, these, shared, attributes, can, be, a, common, set, of, traditions, ancestry, language, history, society, culture, nation, religion, or, social, treatment, within, their, residing, area, there, is, no, generally, accepted, definition, of, what, constitutes, an, ethnic, group, and, humans, have, evolved, the, ability, to, change, affiliation, with, social, groups, relatively, easily, including, leaving, groups, with, previously, strong, alliances, if, doing, so, is, seen, as, providing, personal, advantages, ethnicity, is, separate, from, the, concept, of, race, which, is, based, on, physical, characteristics, although, both, are, socially, constructed, assigning, ethnicity, to, a, certain, population, is, complicated, as, even, within, common, ethnic, designations, there, can, be, a, diverse, range, of, subgroups, and, the, makeup, of, these, ethnic, groups, can, change, over, time, at, both, the, collective, and, individual, level, ethnic, groupings, can, play, a, powerful, role, in, the, social, identity, and, solidarity, of, ethnopolitical, units, ethnic, identity, has, been, closely, tied, to, the, rise, of, the, nation, state, as, the, predominant, form, of, political, organization, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, governments, create, laws, and, policies, that, affect, the, people, that, they, govern, there, have, been, many, forms, of, government, throughout, human, history, with, various, ways, of, allocating, power, and, with, different, levels, and, means, of, control, over, the, population, in, early, history, distribution, of, political, power, was, determined, by, the, availability, of, fresh, water, fertile, soil, and, temperate, climate, of, different, locations, as, farming, populations, gathered, in, larger, and, denser, communities, interactions, between, different, groups, increased, leading, to, the, further, development, of, governance, within, and, between, communities, as, of, 2022, according, to, the, economist, 43, of, national, governments, were, democracies, 35, autocracies, and, 22, containing, elements, of, both, many, countries, have, formed, international, political, organizations, and, alliances, the, largest, being, the, united, nations, with, 193, member, states, trade, the, voluntary, exchange, of, goods, and, services, has, long, been, an, aspect, of, human, societies, and, it, is, seen, as, a, characteristic, that, differentiates, humans, from, other, animals, trade, has, even, been, cited, as, a, practice, that, gave, homo, sapiens, a, major, advantage, over, other, hominids, evidence, suggests, early, h, sapiens, made, use, of, long, distance, trade, routes, to, exchange, goods, and, ideas, leading, to, cultural, explosions, and, providing, additional, food, sources, when, hunting, was, sparse, such, trade, networks, did, not, exist, for, the, now, extinct, neanderthals, early, trade, involved, materials, for, creating, tools, like, obsidian, exchanged, over, short, distances, in, contrast, throughout, antiquity, and, the, medieval, period, some, of, the, most, influential, long, distance, routes, carried, food, and, luxury, goods, such, as, the, spice, trade, early, human, economies, were, more, likely, to, be, based, around, gift, giving, than, a, bartering, system, early, money, consisted, of, commodities, the, oldest, being, in, the, form, of, cattle, and, the, most, widely, used, being, cowrie, shells, money, has, since, evolved, into, governmental, issued, coins, paper, and, electronic, money, human, study, of, economics, is, a, social, science, that, looks, at, how, societies, distribute, scarce, resources, among, different, people, there, are, massive, inequalities, in, the, division, of, wealth, among, humans, as, of, 2018, in, china, europe, and, the, united, states, the, richest, tenth, of, humans, hold, more, than, seven, tenths, of, those, regions, total, wealth, the, willingness, of, humans, to, kill, other, members, of, their, species, en, masse, through, organized, conflict, i, e, war, has, long, been, the, subject, of, debate, one, school, of, thought, is, that, war, evolved, as, a, means, to, eliminate, competitors, and, that, violence, is, an, innate, human, characteristic, humans, commit, violence, against, other, humans, at, a, rate, comparable, to, other, primates, although, humans, kill, adults, at, a, relatively, high, rate, and, have, a, relatively, low, rate, of, infanticide, another, school, of, thought, suggests, that, war, is, a, relatively, recent, phenomenon, and, appeared, due, to, changing, social, conditions, while, not, settled, the, current, evidence, suggests, warlike, behavior, only, became, common, about, 10, 000, years, ago, and, in, many, regions, even, more, recently, phylogenetic, analysis, predicts, 2, of, human, deaths, to, be, caused, by, homicide, which, approximately, matches, the, rate, of, homicide, in, band, societies, however, rates, of, violence, vary, widely, according, to, societal, norms, and, rates, of, homicide, in, societies, that, have, legal, systems, and, strong, cultural, attitudes, against, violence, stand, at, about, 0, 01
