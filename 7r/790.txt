criticism, a, sole, focus, on, overhead, however, can, be, counterproductive, research, published, by, the, urban, institute, and, stanford, university, s, center, for, social, innovation, have, shown, that, rating, agencies, create, incentives, for, ngos, to, lower, and, hide, overhead, costs, which, may, reduce, organizational, effectiveness, by, starving, organizations, of, infrastructure,
