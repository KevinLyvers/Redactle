the, austronesian, languages, s, t, r, n, i, n, aw, str, nee, zh, n, are, a, language, family, widely, spoken, throughout, maritime, southeast, asia, parts, of, mainland, southeast, asia, madagascar, the, islands, of, the, pacific, ocean, and, taiwan, by, taiwanese, indigenous, peoples, they, are, spoken, by, about, 328, million, people, 4, 4, of, the, world, population, this, makes, it, the, fifth, largest, language, family, by, number, of, speakers, major, austronesian, languages, include, malay, around, 250, 270, million, in, indonesia, alone, in, its, own, literary, standard, named, indonesian, javanese, sundanese, tagalog, standardized, as, filipino, malagasy, and, cebuano, according, to, some, estimates, the, family, contains, 1, 257, languages, which, is, the, second, most, of, any, language, family, in, 1706, the, dutch, scholar, adriaan, reland, first, observed, similarities, between, the, languages, spoken, in, the, malay, archipelago, and, by, peoples, on, islands, in, the, pacific, ocean, in, the, 19th, century, researchers, e, g, wilhelm, von, humboldt, herman, van, der, tuuk, started, to, apply, the, comparative, method, to, the, austronesian, languages, the, first, extensive, study, on, the, history, of, the, phonology, was, made, by, the, german, linguist, otto, dempwolff, it, included, a, reconstruction, of, the, proto, austronesian, lexicon, the, term, austronesian, was, coined, as, german, austronesisch, by, wilhelm, schmidt, deriving, it, from, latin, auster, south, and, ancient, greek, n, sos, island, most, austronesian, languages, are, spoken, by, island, dwellers, only, a, few, languages, such, as, malay, and, the, chamic, languages, are, indigenous, to, mainland, asia, many, austronesian, languages, have, very, few, speakers, but, the, major, austronesian, languages, are, spoken, by, tens, of, millions, of, people, for, example, indonesian, is, spoken, by, around, 197, 7, million, people, this, makes, it, the, eleventh, most, spoken, language, in, the, world, approximately, twenty, austronesian, languages, are, official, in, their, respective, countries, see, the, list, of, major, and, official, austronesian, languages, by, the, number, of, languages, they, include, austronesian, and, niger, congo, are, the, two, largest, language, families, in, the, world, they, each, contain, roughly, one, fifth, of, the, world, s, languages, the, geographical, span, of, austronesian, was, the, largest, of, any, language, family, in, the, first, half, of, the, second, millennium, ce, before, the, spread, of, indo, european, in, the, colonial, period, it, ranged, from, madagascar, off, the, southeastern, coast, of, africa, to, easter, island, in, the, eastern, pacific, hawaiian, rapa, nui, m, ori, and, malagasy, spoken, on, madagascar, are, the, geographic, outliers, according, to, robert, blust, 1999, austronesian, is, divided, into, several, primary, branches, all, but, one, of, which, are, found, exclusively, in, taiwan, the, formosan, languages, of, taiwan, are, grouped, into, as, many, as, nine, first, order, subgroups, of, austronesian, all, austronesian, languages, spoken, outside, the, taiwan, mainland, including, its, offshore, yami, language, belong, to, the, malayo, polynesian, sometimes, called, extra, formosan, branch, most, austronesian, languages, lack, a, long, history, of, written, attestation, this, makes, reconstructing, earlier, stages, up, to, distant, proto, austronesian, all, the, more, remarkable, the, oldest, inscription, in, the, cham, language, the, ng, y, n, ch, u, inscription, dated, to, c, 350, ad, is, the, first, attestation, of, any, austronesian, language, the, austronesian, languages, overall, possess, phoneme, inventories, which, are, smaller, than, the, world, average, around, 90, of, the, austronesian, languages, have, inventories, of, 19, 25, sounds, 15, 20, consonants, and, 4, 5, vowels, thus, lying, at, the, lower, end, of, the, global, typical, range, of, 20, 37, sounds, however, extreme, inventories, are, also, found, such, as, nemi, new, caledonia, with, 43, consonants, the, canonical, root, type, in, proto, austronesian, is, disyllabic, with, the, shape, cv, c, cvc, c, consonant, v, vowel, and, is, still, found, in, many, austronesian, languages, in, most, languages, consonant, clusters, are, only, allowed, in, medial, position, and, often, there, are, restrictions, for, the, first, element, of, the, cluster, there, is, a, common, drift, to, reduce, the, number, of, consonants, which, can, appear, in, final, position, e, g, buginese, which, only, allows, the, two, consonants, and, as, finals, out, of, a, total, number, of, 18, consonants, complete, absence, of, final, consonants, is, observed, e, g, in, nias, malagasy, and, many, oceanic, languages, tonal, contrasts, are, rare, in, austronesian, languages, although, moklen, and, a, few, languages, of, the, chamic, south, halmahera, west, new, guinea, and, new, caledonian, subgroups, do, show, lexical, tone, most, austronesian, languages, are, agglutinative, languages, with, a, relatively, high, number, of, affixes, and, clear, morpheme, boundaries, most, affixes, are, prefixes, malay, and, indonesian, ber, jalan, walk, jalan, road, with, a, smaller, number, of, suffixes, tagalog, titis, n, ashtray, t, tis, ash, and, infixes, roviana, t, in, avete, work, noun, tavete, work, verb, reduplication, is, commonly, employed, in, austronesian, languages, this, includes, full, reduplication, malay, and, indonesian, anak, anak, children, anak, child, karo, batak, nipe, nipe, caterpillar, nipe, snake, or, partial, reduplication, agta, taktakki, legs, takki, leg, at, atu, puppy, atu, dog, it, is, difficult, to, make, generalizations, about, the, languages, that, make, up, a, family, as, diverse, as, austronesian, very, broadly, one, can, divide, the, austronesian, languages, into, three, groups, philippine, type, languages, indonesian, type, languages, and, post, indonesian, type, languages, the, austronesian, language, family, has, been, established, by, the, linguistic, comparative, method, on, the, basis, of, cognate, sets, sets, of, words, from, multiple, languages, which, are, similar, in, sound, and, meaning, which, can, be, shown, to, be, descended, from, the, same, ancestral, word, in, proto, austronesian, according, to, regular, rules, some, cognate, sets, are, very, stable, the, word, for, eye, in, many, austronesian, languages, is, mata, from, the, most, northerly, austronesian, languages, formosan, languages, such, as, bunun, and, amis, all, the, way, south, to, m, ori, other, words, are, harder, to, reconstruct, the, word, for, two, is, also, stable, in, that, it, appears, over, the, entire, range, of, the, austronesian, family, but, the, forms, e, g, bunun, dusa, amis, tusa, m, ori, rua, require, some, linguistic, expertise, to, recognise, the, austronesian, basic, vocabulary, database, gives, word, lists, coded, for, cognateness, for, approximately, 1000, austronesian, languages, the, internal, structure, of, the, austronesian, languages, is, complex, the, family, consists, of, many, similar, and, closely, related, languages, with, large, numbers, of, dialect, continua, making, it, difficult, to, recognize, boundaries, between, branches, the, first, major, step, towards, high, order, subgrouping, was, dempwolff, s, recognition, of, the, oceanic, subgroup, called, melanesisch, by, dempwolff, the, special, position, of, the, languages, of, taiwan, was, first, recognized, by, andr, georges, haudricourt, 1965, who, divided, the, austronesian, languages, into, three, subgroups, northern, austronesian, formosan, eastern, austronesian, oceanic, and, western, austronesian, all, remaining, languages, in, a, study, that, represents, the, first, lexicostatistical, classification, of, the, austronesian, languages, isidore, dyen, 1965, presented, a, radically, different, subgrouping, scheme, he, posited, 40, first, order, subgroups, with, the, highest, degree, of, diversity, found, in, the, area, of, melanesia, the, oceanic, languages, are, not, recognized, but, are, distributed, over, more, than, 30, of, his, proposed, first, order, subgroups, dyen, s, classification, was, widely, criticized, and, for, the, most, part, rejected, but, several, of, his, lower, order, subgroups, are, still, accepted, e, g, the, cordilleran, languages, the, bilic, languages, or, the, murutic, languages, subsequently, the, position, of, the, formosan, languages, as, the, most, archaic, group, of, austronesian, languages, was, recognized, by, otto, christian, dahl, 1973, followed, by, proposals, from, other, scholars, that, the, formosan, languages, actually, make, up, more, than, one, first, order, subgroup, of, austronesian, robert, blust, 1977, first, presented, the, subgrouping, model, which, is, currently, accepted, by, virtually, all, scholars, in, the, field, with, more, than, one, first, order, subgroup, on, taiwan, and, a, single, first, order, branch, encompassing, all, austronesian, languages, spoken, outside, of, taiwan, viz, malayo, polynesian, the, relationships, of, the, formosan, languages, to, each, other, and, the, internal, structure, of, malayo, polynesian, continue, to, be, debated, in, addition, to, malayo, polynesian, thirteen, formosan, subgroups, are, broadly, accepted, the, seminal, article, in, the, classification, of, formosan, and, by, extension, the, top, level, structure, of, austronesian, is, blust, 1999, prominent, formosanists, linguists, who, specialize, in, formosan, languages, take, issue, with, some, of, its, details, but, it, remains, the, point, of, reference, for, current, linguistic, analyses, debate, centers, primarily, around, the, relationships, between, these, families, of, the, classifications, presented, here, blust, 1999, links, two, families, into, a, western, plains, group, two, more, in, a, northwestern, formosan, group, and, three, into, an, eastern, formosan, group, while, li, 2008, also, links, five, families, into, a, northern, formosan, group, harvey, 1982, chang, 2006, and, ross, 2012, split, tsouic, and, blust, 2013, agrees, the, group, is, probably, not, valid, other, studies, have, presented, phonological, evidence, for, a, reduced, paiwanic, family, of, paiwanic, puyuma, bunun, amis, and, malayo, polynesian, but, this, is, not, reflected, in, vocabulary, the, eastern, formosan, peoples, basay, kavalan, and, amis, share, a, homeland, motif, that, has, them, coming, originally, from, an, island, called, sinasay, or, sanasay, the, amis, in, particular, maintain, that, they, came, from, the, east, and, were, treated, by, the, puyuma, amongst, whom, they, settled, as, a, subservient, group, this, classification, retains, blust, s, east, formosan, and, unites, the, other, northern, languages, li, 2008, proposes, a, proto, formosan, f0, ancestor, and, equates, it, with, proto, austronesian, pan, following, the, model, in, starosta, 1995, rukai, and, tsouic, are, seen, as, highly, divergent, although, the, position, of, rukai, is, highly, controversial, sagart, 2004, proposes, that, the, numerals, of, the, formosan, languages, reflect, a, nested, series, of, innovations, from, languages, in, the, northwest, near, the, putative, landfall, of, the, austronesian, migration, from, the, mainland, which, share, only, the, numerals, 1, 4, with, proto, malayo, polynesian, counter, clockwise, to, the, eastern, languages, purple, on, map, which, share, all, numerals, 1, 10, sagart, 2021, finds, other, shared, innovations, that, follow, the, same, pattern, he, proposes, that, pmp, lima, five, is, a, lexical, replacement, from, hand, and, that, pmp, pitu, seven, walu, eight, and, siwa, nine, are, contractions, of, pan, racep, five, a, ligature, a, or, i, and, and, dusa, two, telu, three, sepat, four, an, analogical, pattern, historically, attested, from, pazeh, the, fact, that, the, kradai, languages, share, the, numeral, system, and, other, lexical, innovations, of, pmp, suggests, that, they, are, a, coordinate, branch, with, malayo, polynesian, rather, than, a, sister, family, to, austronesian, sagart, s, resulting, classification, is, the, malayo, polynesian, languages, are, among, other, things, characterized, by, certain, sound, changes, such, as, the, mergers, of, proto, austronesian, pan, t, c, to, proto, malayo, polynesian, pmp, t, and, pan, n, n, to, pmp, n, and, the, shift, of, pan, s, to, pmp, h, there, appear, to, have, been, two, great, migrations, of, austronesian, languages, that, quickly, covered, large, areas, resulting, in, multiple, local, groups, with, little, large, scale, structure, the, first, was, malayo, polynesian, distributed, across, the, philippines, indonesia, and, melanesia, the, second, migration, was, that, of, the, oceanic, languages, into, polynesia, and, micronesia, from, the, standpoint, of, historical, linguistics, the, place, of, origin, in, linguistic, terminology, urheimat, of, the, austronesian, languages, proto, austronesian, language, is, most, likely, the, main, island, of, taiwan, also, known, as, formosa, on, this, island, the, deepest, divisions, in, austronesian, are, found, along, small, geographic, distances, among, the, families, of, the, native, formosan, languages, according, to, robert, blust, the, formosan, languages, form, nine, of, the, ten, primary, branches, of, the, austronesian, language, family, comrie, 2001, 28, noted, this, when, he, wrote, the, internal, diversity, among, the, formosan, languages, is, greater, than, that, in, all, the, rest, of, austronesian, put, together, so, there, is, a, major, genetic, split, within, austronesian, between, formosan, and, the, rest, indeed, the, genetic, diversity, within, formosan, is, so, great, that, it, may, well, consist, of, several, primary, branches, of, the, overall, austronesian, family, at, least, since, sapir, 1968, writing, in, 1949, linguists, have, generally, accepted, that, the, chronology, of, the, dispersal, of, languages, within, a, given, language, family, can, be, traced, from, the, area, of, greatest, linguistic, variety, to, that, of, the, least, for, example, english, in, north, america, has, large, numbers, of, speakers, but, relatively, low, dialectal, diversity, while, english, in, great, britain, has, much, higher, diversity, such, low, linguistic, variety, by, sapir, s, thesis, suggests, a, more, recent, spread, of, english, in, north, america, while, some, scholars, suspect, that, the, number, of, principal, branches, among, the, formosan, languages, may, be, somewhat, less, than, blust, s, estimate, of, nine, e, g, li, 2006, there, is, little, contention, among, linguists, with, this, analysis, and, the, resulting, view, of, the, origin, and, direction, of, the, migration, for, a, recent, dissenting, analysis, see, peiros, 2004, the, protohistory, of, the, austronesian, people, can, be, traced, farther, back, through, time, to, get, an, idea, of, the, original, homeland, of, the, populations, ancestral, to, the, austronesian, peoples, as, opposed, to, strictly, linguistic, arguments, evidence, from, archaeology, and, population, genetics, may, be, adduced, studies, from, the, science, of, genetics, have, produced, conflicting, outcomes, some, researchers, find, evidence, for, a, proto, austronesian, homeland, on, the, asian, mainland, e, g, melton, et, al, 1998, while, others, mirror, the, linguistic, research, rejecting, an, east, asian, origin, in, favor, of, taiwan, e, g, trejaut, et, al, 2005, archaeological, evidence, e, g, bellwood, 1997, is, more, consistent, suggesting, that, the, ancestors, of, the, austronesians, spread, from, the, south, chinese, mainland, to, taiwan, at, some, time, around, 8, 000, years, ago, evidence, from, historical, linguistics, suggests, that, it, is, from, this, island, that, seafaring, peoples, migrated, perhaps, in, distinct, waves, separated, by, millennia, to, the, entire, region, encompassed, by, the, austronesian, languages, it, is, believed, that, this, migration, began, around, 6, 000, years, ago, however, evidence, from, historical, linguistics, cannot, bridge, the, gap, between, those, two, periods, the, view, that, linguistic, evidence, connects, austronesian, languages, to, the, sino, tibetan, ones, as, proposed, for, example, by, sagart, 2002, is, a, minority, one, as, fox, 2004, 8, states, implied, in, discussions, of, subgrouping, is, a, broad, consensus, that, the, homeland, of, the, austronesians, was, in, taiwan, this, homeland, area, may, have, also, included, the, p, eng, hu, pescadores, islands, between, taiwan, and, china, and, possibly, even, sites, on, the, coast, of, mainland, china, especially, if, one, were, to, view, the, early, austronesians, as, a, population, of, related, dialect, communities, living, in, scattered, coastal, settlements, linguistic, analysis, of, the, proto, austronesian, language, stops, at, the, western, shores, of, taiwan, any, related, mainland, language, s, have, not, survived, the, only, exceptions, the, chamic, languages, derive, from, more, recent, migration, to, the, mainland, however, according, to, ostapirat, s, interpretation, of, the, seriously, discussed, austro, tai, hypothesis, the, kra, dai, languages, also, known, as, tai, kadai, are, exactly, those, related, mainland, languages, genealogical, links, have, been, proposed, between, austronesian, and, various, families, of, east, and, southeast, asia, an, austro, tai, proposal, linking, austronesian, and, the, kra, dai, languages, of, the, southeastern, continental, asian, mainland, was, first, proposed, by, paul, k, benedict, and, is, supported, by, weera, ostapirat, roger, blench, and, laurent, sagart, based, on, the, traditional, comparative, method, ostapirat, 2005, proposes, a, series, of, regular, correspondences, linking, the, two, families, and, assumes, a, primary, split, with, kra, dai, speakers, being, the, people, who, stayed, behind, in, their, chinese, homeland, blench, 2004, suggests, that, if, the, connection, is, valid, the, relationship, is, unlikely, to, be, one, of, two, sister, families, rather, he, suggests, that, proto, kra, dai, speakers, were, austronesians, who, migrated, to, hainan, island, and, back, to, the, mainland, from, the, northern, philippines, and, that, their, distinctiveness, results, from, radical, restructuring, following, contact, with, hmong, mien, and, sinitic, an, extended, version, of, austro, tai, was, hypothesized, by, benedict, who, added, the, japonic, languages, to, the, proposal, as, well, a, link, with, the, austroasiatic, languages, in, an, austric, phylum, is, based, mostly, on, typological, evidence, however, there, is, also, morphological, evidence, of, a, connection, between, the, conservative, nicobarese, languages, and, austronesian, languages, of, the, philippines, robert, blust, supports, the, hypothesis, which, connects, the, lower, yangtze, neolithic, austro, tai, entity, with, the, rice, cultivating, austro, asiatic, cultures, assuming, the, center, of, east, asian, rice, domestication, and, putative, austric, homeland, to, be, located, in, the, yunnan, burma, border, area, under, that, view, there, was, an, east, west, genetic, alignment, resulting, from, a, rice, based, population, expansion, in, the, southern, part, of, east, asia, austroasiatic, kra, dai, austronesian, with, unrelated, sino, tibetan, occupying, a, more, northerly, tier, french, linguist, and, sinologist, laurent, sagart, considers, the, austronesian, languages, to, be, related, to, the, sino, tibetan, languages, and, also, groups, the, kra, dai, languages, as, more, closely, related, to, the, malayo, polynesian, languages, sagart, argues, for, a, north, south, genetic, relationship, between, chinese, and, austronesian, based, on, sound, correspondences, in, the, basic, vocabulary, and, morphological, parallels, laurent, sagart, 2017, concludes, that, the, possession, of, the, two, kinds, of, millets, in, taiwanese, austronesian, languages, not, just, setaria, as, previously, thought, places, the, pre, austronesians, in, northeastern, china, adjacent, to, the, probable, sino, tibetan, homeland, ko, et, al, s, genetic, research, 2014, appears, to, support, laurent, sagart, s, linguistic, proposal, pointing, out, that, the, exclusively, austronesian, mtdna, e, haplogroup, and, the, largely, sino, tibetan, m9a, haplogroup, are, twin, sisters, indicative, of, an, intimate, connection, between, the, early, austronesian, and, sino, tibetan, maternal, gene, pools, at, least, additionally, results, from, wei, et, al, 2017, are, also, in, agreement, with, sagart, s, proposal, in, which, their, analyses, show, that, the, predominantly, austronesian, y, dna, haplogroup, o3a2b, p164, xm134, belongs, to, a, newly, defined, haplogroup, o3a2b2, n6, being, widely, distributed, along, the, eastern, coastal, regions, of, asia, from, korea, to, vietnam, sagart, also, groups, the, austronesian, languages, in, a, recursive, like, fashion, placing, kra, dai, as, a, sister, branch, of, malayo, polynesian, his, methodology, has, been, found, to, be, spurious, by, his, peers, several, linguists, have, proposed, that, japanese, is, genetically, related, to, the, austronesian, family, cf, benedict, 1990, matsumoto, 1975, miller, 1967, some, other, linguists, think, it, is, more, plausible, that, japanese, is, not, genetically, related, to, the, austronesian, languages, but, instead, was, influenced, by, an, austronesian, substratum, or, adstratum, those, who, propose, this, scenario, suggest, that, the, austronesian, family, once, covered, the, islands, to, the, north, as, well, as, to, the, south, martine, robbeets, 2017, claims, that, japanese, genetically, belongs, to, the, transeurasian, macro, altaic, languages, but, underwent, lexical, influence, from, para, austronesian, a, presumed, sister, language, of, proto, austronesian, the, linguist, ann, kumar, 2009, proposed, that, some, austronesians, might, have, migrated, to, japan, possibly, an, elite, group, from, java, and, created, the, japanese, hierarchical, society, she, also, identifies, 82, possible, cognates, between, austronesian, and, japanese, however, her, theory, remains, very, controversial, the, linguist, asha, pereltsvaig, criticized, kumar, s, theory, on, several, points, the, archaeological, problem, with, that, theory, is, that, contrary, to, the, claim, that, there, was, no, rice, farming, in, china, and, korea, in, prehistoric, times, excavations, have, indicated, that, rice, farming, has, been, practiced, in, this, area, since, at, least, 5000, bc, there, are, also, genetic, problems, the, pre, yayoi, japanese, lineage, was, not, shared, with, southeast, asians, but, was, shared, with, northwest, chinese, tibetans, and, central, asians, linguistic, problems, were, also, pointed, out, kumar, did, not, claim, that, japanese, was, an, austronesian, language, derived, from, proto, javanese, language, but, only, that, it, provided, a, superstratum, language, for, old, japanese, based, on, 82, plausible, javanese, japanese, cognates, mostly, related, to, rice, farming, in, 2001, stanley, starosta, proposed, a, new, language, family, named, east, asian, that, includes, all, primary, language, families, in, the, broader, east, asia, region, except, japonic, and, koreanic, this, proposed, family, consists, of, two, branches, austronesian, and, sino, tibetan, yangzian, with, the, kra, dai, family, considered, to, be, a, branch, of, austronesian, and, yangzian, to, be, a, new, sister, branch, of, sino, tibetan, consisting, of, the, austroasiatic, and, hmong, mien, languages, this, proposal, was, further, researched, on, by, linguists, such, as, michael, d, larish, in, 2006, who, also, included, the, japonic, and, koreanic, languages, in, the, macrofamily, the, proposal, has, since, been, adopted, by, linguists, such, as, george, van, driem, albeit, without, the, inclusion, of, japonic, and, koreanic, blevins, 2007, proposed, that, the, austronesian, and, the, ongan, protolanguage, are, the, descendants, of, an, austronesian, ongan, protolanguage, this, view, is, not, supported, by, mainstream, linguists, and, remains, very, controversial, robert, blust, rejects, blevins, proposal, as, far, fetched, and, based, solely, on, chance, resemblances, and, methodologically, flawed, comparisons, most, austronesian, languages, have, latin, based, writing, systems, today, some, non, latin, based, writing, systems, are, listed, below, below, are, two, charts, comparing, list, of, numbers, of, 1, 10, and, thirteen, words, in, austronesian, languages, spoken, in,
