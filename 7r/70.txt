fishing, is, the, activity, of, trying, to, catch, fish, fish, are, often, caught, as, wildlife, from, the, natural, environment, fresh, water, or, marine, but, may, also, be, caught, from, stocked, bodies, of, water, such, as, ponds, canals, park, wetlands, and, reservoirs, fishing, techniques, include, hand, gathering, spearing, netting, angling, shooting, and, trapping, as, well, as, more, destructive, and, often, illegal, techniques, such, as, electrocution, blasting, and, poisoning, the, term, fishing, broadly, includes, catching, aquatic, animals, other, than, fish, such, as, crustaceans, shrimp, lobsters, crabs, shellfish, cephalopods, octopus, squid, and, echinoderms, starfish, sea, urchins, the, term, is, not, normally, applied, to, harvesting, fish, raised, in, controlled, cultivations, fish, farming, nor, is, it, normally, applied, to, hunting, aquatic, mammals, where, terms, like, whaling, and, sealing, are, used, instead, fishing, has, been, an, important, part, of, human, culture, since, hunter, gatherer, times, it, is, one, of, the, few, food, production, activities, that, has, persisted, from, prehistory, into, the, modern, age, surviving, both, the, neolithic, revolution, and, successive, industrial, revolutions, in, addition, to, fishing, for, food, people, commonly, fish, as, a, recreational, pastime, fishing, tournaments, are, held, and, caught, fish, are, sometimes, kept, long, term, as, preserved, or, living, trophies, when, bioblitzes, occur, fish, are, typically, caught, identified, and, then, released, according, to, the, united, nations, fao, statistics, the, total, number, of, commercial, fishers, and, fish, farmers, is, estimated, to, be, 39, 0, million, fishing, industries, and, aquaculture, provide, direct, and, indirect, employment, to, over, 500, million, people, in, developing, countries, in, 2005, the, worldwide, per, capita, consumption, of, fish, captured, from, wild, fisheries, was, 14, 4, kilograms, 32, lb, with, an, additional, 7, 4, kilograms, 16, lb, harvested, from, fish, farms, fishing, is, an, ancient, practice, that, dates, back, to, at, least, the, beginning, of, the, upper, paleolithic, period, about, 40, 000, years, ago, isotopic, analysis, of, the, remains, of, tianyuan, man, a, 40, 000, year, old, modern, human, from, eastern, asia, has, shown, that, he, regularly, consumed, freshwater, fish, archaeology, features, such, as, shell, middens, discarded, fish, bones, and, cave, paintings, show, that, seafood, was, important, for, survival, and, consumed, in, significant, quantities, fishing, in, africa, is, evident, very, early, on, in, human, history, neanderthals, were, fishing, by, about, 200, 000, bc, people, could, have, developed, basketry, for, fish, traps, using, spinning, and, early, forms, of, knitting, to, make, fishing, nets, able, to, catch, more, fish, during, this, period, most, people, lived, a, hunter, gatherer, lifestyle, and, were, of, necessity, constantly, on, the, move, however, where, there, are, early, examples, of, permanent, settlements, though, not, necessarily, permanently, occupied, such, as, those, at, lepenski, vir, they, are, almost, always, associated, with, fishing, as, a, major, source, of, food, the, british, dogger, was, a, very, early, type, of, sailing, trawler, from, the, 17th, century, but, the, modern, fishing, trawler, was, developed, in, the, 19th, century, at, the, english, fishing, port, of, brixham, by, the, early, 19th, century, the, fishers, at, brixham, needed, to, expand, their, fishing, area, further, than, ever, before, due, to, the, ongoing, depletion, of, stocks, that, was, occurring, in, the, overfished, waters, of, south, devon, the, brixham, trawler, that, evolved, there, was, of, a, sleek, build, and, had, a, tall, gaff, rig, which, gave, the, vessel, sufficient, speed, to, make, long, distance, trips, out, to, the, fishing, grounds, in, the, ocean, they, were, also, sufficiently, robust, to, be, able, to, tow, large, trawls, in, deep, water, the, great, trawling, fleet, that, built, up, at, brixham, earned, the, village, the, title, of, mother, of, deep, sea, fisheries, this, revolutionary, design, made, large, scale, trawling, in, the, ocean, possible, for, the, first, time, resulting, in, a, massive, migration, of, fishers, from, the, ports, in, the, south, of, england, to, villages, further, north, such, as, scarborough, hull, grimsby, harwich, and, yarmouth, that, were, points, of, access, to, the, large, fishing, grounds, in, the, atlantic, ocean, the, small, village, of, grimsby, grew, to, become, the, largest, fishing, port, in, the, world, by, the, mid, 19th, century, an, act, of, parliament, was, first, obtained, in, 1796, which, authorised, the, construction, of, new, quays, and, dredging, of, the, haven, to, make, it, deeper, it, was, only, in, 1846, with, the, tremendous, expansion, in, the, fishing, industry, that, the, grimsby, dock, company, was, formed, the, foundation, stone, for, the, royal, dock, was, laid, by, albert, the, prince, consort, in, 1849, the, dock, covered, 25, acres, 10, ha, and, was, formally, opened, by, queen, victoria, in, 1854, as, the, first, modern, fishing, port, the, elegant, brixham, trawler, spread, across, the, world, influencing, fishing, fleets, everywhere, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, there, were, over, 3, 000, fishing, trawlers, in, commission, in, britain, with, almost, 1, 000, at, grimsby, these, trawlers, were, sold, to, fishers, around, europe, including, from, the, netherlands, and, scandinavia, twelve, trawlers, went, on, to, form, the, nucleus, of, the, german, fishing, fleet, the, earliest, steam, powered, fishing, boats, first, appeared, in, the, 1870s, and, used, the, trawl, system, of, fishing, as, well, as, lines, and, drift, nets, these, were, large, boats, usually, 80, 90, feet, 24, 27, m, in, length, with, a, beam, of, around, 20, feet, 6, m, they, weighed, 40, 50, tons, and, travelled, at, 9, 11, knots, 17, 20, km, h, 10, 13, mph, david, allen, designed, and, made, the, earliest, purpose, built, fishing, vessels, in, leith, scotland, in, march, 1875, when, he, converted, a, drifter, to, steam, power, in, 1877, he, built, the, first, screw, propelled, steam, trawler, in, the, world, steam, trawlers, were, introduced, at, grimsby, and, hull, in, the, 1880s, in, 1890, it, was, estimated, that, there, were, 20, 000, men, on, the, north, sea, the, steam, drifter, was, not, used, in, the, herring, fishery, until, 1897, the, last, sailing, fishing, trawler, was, built, in, 1925, in, grimsby, trawler, designs, adapted, as, the, way, they, were, powered, changed, from, sail, to, coal, fired, steam, by, world, war, i, to, diesel, and, turbines, by, the, end, of, world, war, ii, in, 1931, the, first, powered, drum, was, created, by, laurie, jarelainen, the, drum, was, a, circular, device, that, was, set, to, the, side, of, the, boat, and, would, draw, in, the, nets, since, world, war, ii, radio, navigation, aids, and, fish, finders, have, been, widely, used, the, first, trawlers, fished, over, the, side, rather, than, over, the, stern, the, first, purpose, built, stern, trawler, was, fairtry, built, in, 1953, at, aberdeen, scotland, the, ship, was, much, larger, than, any, other, trawlers, then, in, operation, and, inaugurated, the, era, of, the, super, trawler, as, the, ship, pulled, its, nets, over, the, stern, it, could, lift, out, a, much, greater, haul, of, up, to, 60, tons, the, ship, served, as, a, basis, for, the, expansion, of, super, trawlers, around, the, world, in, the, following, decades, the, early, evolution, of, fishing, as, recreation, is, not, clear, for, example, there, is, anecdotal, evidence, for, fly, fishing, in, japan, however, fly, fishing, was, likely, to, have, been, a, means, of, survival, rather, than, recreation, the, earliest, english, essay, on, recreational, fishing, was, published, in, 1496, by, dame, juliana, berners, the, prioress, of, the, benedictine, sopwell, nunnery, the, essay, was, titled, treatyse, of, fysshynge, wyth, an, angle, and, included, detailed, information, on, fishing, waters, the, construction, of, rods, and, lines, and, the, use, of, natural, baits, and, artificial, flies, recreational, fishing, took, a, great, leap, forward, after, the, english, civil, war, where, a, newly, found, interest, in, the, activity, left, its, mark, on, the, many, books, and, treatises, that, were, written, on, the, subject, at, the, time, leonard, mascall, in, 1589, wrote, a, booke, of, fishing, with, hooke, and, line, along, with, many, others, he, produced, in, his, life, on, game, and, wildlife, in, england, at, the, time, the, compleat, angler, was, written, by, izaak, walton, in, 1653, although, walton, continued, to, add, to, it, for, a, quarter, of, a, century, and, described, the, fishing, in, the, derbyshire, wye, it, was, a, celebration, of, the, art, and, spirit, of, fishing, in, prose, and, verse, a, second, part, to, the, book, was, added, by, walton, s, friend, charles, cotton, charles, kirby, designed, an, improved, fishing, hook, in, 1655, that, remains, relatively, unchanged, to, this, day, he, went, on, to, invent, the, kirby, bend, a, distinctive, hook, with, an, offset, point, still, commonly, used, today, the, 18th, century, was, mainly, an, era, of, consolidation, of, the, techniques, developed, in, the, previous, century, running, rings, began, to, appear, along, the, fishing, rods, which, gave, anglers, greater, control, over, the, cast, line, the, rods, themselves, were, also, becoming, increasingly, sophisticated, and, specialised, for, different, roles, jointed, rods, became, common, from, the, middle, of, the, century, and, bamboo, came, to, be, used, for, the, top, section, of, the, rod, giving, it, much, greater, strength, and, flexibility, the, industry, also, became, commercialised, rods, and, tackle, were, sold, at, the, haberdashers, store, after, the, great, fire, of, london, in, 1666, artisans, moved, to, redditch, which, became, a, centre, of, production, of, fishing, related, products, from, the, 1730s, onesimus, ustonson, established, his, shop, in, 1761, and, his, establishment, remained, a, market, leader, for, the, next, century, he, received, a, royal, warrant, from, three, successive, monarchs, starting, with, king, george, iv, he, also, invented, the, multiplying, winch, the, commercialization, of, the, industry, came, at, a, time, of, expanded, interest, in, fishing, as, a, recreational, hobby, for, members, of, the, aristocracy, the, impact, of, the, industrial, revolution, was, first, felt, in, the, manufacture, of, fly, lines, instead, of, anglers, twisting, their, lines, a, laborious, and, time, consuming, process, the, new, textile, spinning, machines, allowed, for, a, variety, of, tapered, lines, to, be, easily, manufactured, and, marketed, british, fly, fishing, continued, to, develop, in, the, 19th, century, with, the, emergence, of, fly, fishing, clubs, along, with, the, appearance, of, several, books, on, the, subject, of, fly, tying, and, fly, fishing, techniques, by, the, mid, to, late, 19th, century, expanding, leisure, opportunities, for, the, middle, and, lower, classes, began, to, have, an, effect, on, fly, fishing, which, steadily, grew, in, mass, appeal, the, expansion, of, the, railway, network, in, britain, allowed, the, less, affluent, for, the, first, time, to, take, weekend, trips, to, the, seaside, or, rivers, for, fishing, richer, hobbyists, ventured, further, abroad, the, large, rivers, of, norway, replete, with, large, stocks, of, salmon, began, to, attract, fishers, from, england, in, large, numbers, in, the, middle, of, the, century, jones, s, guide, to, norway, and, salmon, fisher, s, pocket, companion, published, in, 1848, was, written, by, frederic, tolfrey, and, was, a, popular, guide, to, the, country, modern, reel, design, had, begun, in, england, during, the, latter, part, of, the, 18th, century, and, the, predominant, model, in, use, was, known, as, the, nottingham, reel, the, reel, was, a, wide, drum, that, spooled, out, freely, and, was, ideal, for, allowing, the, bait, to, drift, a, long, way, out, with, the, current, geared, multiplying, reels, never, successfully, caught, on, in, britain, but, had, more, success, in, the, united, states, where, george, snyder, of, kentucky, modified, similar, models, into, his, bait, casting, reel, the, first, american, made, design, in, 1810, the, material, used, for, the, rod, itself, changed, from, the, heavy, woods, native, to, england, to, lighter, and, more, elastic, varieties, imported, from, abroad, especially, from, south, america, and, the, west, indies, bamboo, rods, became, the, generally, favoured, option, from, the, mid, 19th, century, and, several, strips, of, the, material, were, cut, from, the, cane, milled, into, shape, and, then, glued, together, to, form, the, light, strong, hexagonal, rods, with, a, solid, core, that, were, superior, to, anything, that, preceded, them, george, cotton, and, his, predecessors, fished, their, flies, with, long, rods, and, light, lines, allowing, the, wind, to, do, most, of, the, work, of, getting, the, fly, to, the, fish, tackle, design, began, to, improve, in, the, 1880s, the, introduction, of, new, woods, to, the, manufacture, of, fly, rods, made, it, possible, to, cast, flies, into, the, wind, on, silk, lines, instead, of, horse, hair, these, lines, allowed, for, a, much, greater, casting, distance, however, these, early, fly, lines, proved, troublesome, as, they, had, to, be, coated, with, various, dressings, to, make, them, float, and, needed, to, be, taken, off, the, reel, and, dried, every, four, hours, or, so, to, prevent, them, from, becoming, waterlogged, another, negative, consequence, was, that, it, became, easy, for, the, much, longer, line, to, get, into, a, tangle, this, was, called, a, tangle, in, britain, and, a, backlash, in, the, us, this, problem, spurred, the, invention, of, the, regulator, to, evenly, spool, the, line, out, and, prevent, tangling, the, american, charles, f, orvis, designed, and, distributed, a, novel, reel, and, fly, design, in, 1874, described, by, reel, historian, jim, brown, as, the, benchmark, of, american, reel, design, and, the, first, fully, modern, fly, reel, albert, illingworth, 1st, baron, illingworth, a, textiles, magnate, patented, the, modern, form, of, fixed, spool, spinning, reel, in, 1905, when, casting, illingworth, s, reel, design, the, line, was, drawn, off, the, leading, edge, of, the, spool, but, was, restrained, and, rewound, by, a, line, pickup, a, device, which, orbits, around, the, stationary, spool, because, the, line, did, not, have, to, pull, against, a, rotating, spool, much, lighter, lures, could, be, cast, than, with, conventional, reels, the, development, of, inexpensive, fiberglass, rods, synthetic, fly, lines, and, monofilament, leaders, in, the, early, 1950s, revived, the, popularity, of, fly, fishing, there, are, many, fishing, techniques, and, tactics, for, catching, fish, the, term, can, also, be, applied, to, methods, for, catching, other, aquatic, animals, such, as, molluscs, shellfish, squid, octopus, and, edible, marine, invertebrates, fishing, techniques, include, hand, gathering, spearfishing, netting, angling, bowfishing, and, trapping, as, well, as, less, common, techniques, such, as, gaffing, snagging, clubbing, and, the, use, of, specially, trained, animals, such, as, cormorants, and, otters, there, are, also, destructive, fishing, techniques, such, as, electrocution, blasting, and, poisoning, that, can, do, irreversible, damage, to, the, local, ecosystems, by, killing, sterilizing, entire, fish, stocks, habitat, destruction, and, or, upsetting, the, equilibrium, of, interspecific, competitions, and, such, practices, are, often, deemed, illegal, and, liable, to, criminal, punishments, recreational, commercial, and, artisanal, fishers, use, different, techniques, and, also, sometimes, the, same, techniques, recreational, fishers, fish, for, pleasure, sport, or, to, provide, food, for, themselves, while, commercial, fishers, fish, for, profit, artisanal, fishers, use, traditional, low, tech, methods, for, survival, in, third, world, countries, and, as, a, cultural, heritage, in, other, countries, usually, recreational, fishers, use, angling, methods, and, commercial, fishers, use, netting, methods, a, modern, development, is, to, fish, with, the, assistance, of, a, drone, why, a, fish, bites, a, baited, hook, or, lure, involves, several, factors, related, to, the, sensory, physiology, behaviour, feeding, ecology, and, biology, of, the, fish, as, well, as, the, environment, and, characteristics, of, the, bait, hook, lure, there, is, an, intricate, link, between, various, fishing, techniques, and, knowledge, about, the, fish, and, their, behaviour, including, migration, foraging, and, habitat, the, effective, use, of, fishing, techniques, often, depends, on, this, additional, knowledge, some, fishers, follow, fishing, folklores, which, claim, that, fish, feeding, patterns, are, influenced, by, the, position, of, the, sun, and, the, moon, fishing, tackles, are, the, equipment, used, by, fishers, when, fishing, almost, any, equipment, or, gear, used, for, fishing, can, be, called, a, fishing, tackle, although, the, term, is, most, commonly, associated, with, gear, used, in, angling, some, examples, are, hooks, lines, sinkers, floats, rods, reels, baits, lures, spears, nets, gaffs, traps, waders, and, tackle, boxes, fishing, techniques, refer, to, the, ways, the, tackles, are, used, when, fishing, tackles, that, are, attached, to, the, end, of, a, fishing, line, are, collectively, called, terminal, tackles, these, include, hooks, sinkers, floats, leader, lines, swivels, split, rings, and, any, wires, snaps, beads, spoons, blades, spinners, and, clevises, used, to, attach, spinner, blades, to, fishing, lures, people, also, tend, to, use, dead, or, live, bait, fish, as, another, form, of, bait, a, fishing, vessel, is, a, boat, or, ship, used, to, catch, fish, in, the, sea, or, on, a, lake, or, river, many, different, kinds, of, vessels, are, used, in, commercial, artisanal, and, recreational, fishing, according, to, the, fao, in, 2004, there, were, four, million, commercial, fishing, vessels, about, 1, 3, million, of, these, are, decked, vessels, with, enclosed, areas, nearly, all, of, these, decked, vessels, are, mechanised, and, 40, 000, of, them, are, over, 100, tons, at, the, other, extreme, two, thirds, 1, 8, million, of, the, undecked, boats, are, traditional, craft, of, various, types, powered, only, by, sail, and, oars, these, boats, are, used, by, artisan, fishers, it, is, difficult, to, estimate, how, many, recreational, fishing, boats, there, are, although, the, number, is, high, the, term, is, fluid, since, some, recreational, boats, may, also, be, used, for, fishing, from, time, to, time, unlike, most, commercial, fishing, vessels, recreational, fishing, boats, are, often, not, dedicated, just, to, fishing, just, about, anything, that, will, stay, afloat, can, be, called, a, recreational, fishing, boat, so, long, as, a, fisher, periodically, climbs, aboard, with, the, intent, to, catch, a, fish, fish, are, caught, for, recreational, purposes, from, boats, which, range, from, dugout, canoes, float, tubes, kayaks, rafts, stand, up, paddleboards, pontoon, boats, and, small, dinghies, to, runabouts, cabin, cruisers, and, cruising, yachts, to, large, hi, tech, and, luxurious, big, game, rigs, larger, boats, purpose, built, with, recreational, fishing, in, mind, usually, have, large, open, cockpits, at, the, stern, designed, for, convenient, fishing, traditional, fishing, is, any, kind, of, small, scale, commercial, or, subsistence, fishing, practices, using, traditional, techniques, such, as, rod, and, tackle, arrows, and, harpoons, throw, nets, and, drag, nets, etc, recreational, and, sport, fishing, refer, to, fishing, primarily, for, pleasure, or, competition, recreational, fishing, has, conventions, rules, licensing, restrictions, and, laws, that, limit, how, fish, may, be, caught, typically, these, prohibit, the, use, of, nets, and, the, catching, of, fish, with, hooks, not, in, the, mouth, the, most, common, form, of, recreational, fishing, is, done, with, a, rod, reel, line, hooks, and, any, one, of, a, wide, range, of, baits, or, lures, such, as, artificial, flies, the, practice, of, catching, or, attempting, to, catch, fish, with, a, hook, is, generally, known, as, angling, in, angling, it, is, sometimes, expected, or, required, that, fish, be, returned, to, the, water, catch, and, release, recreational, or, sport, fishermen, may, log, their, catches, or, participate, in, fishing, competitions, the, estimated, global, number, of, recreational, fishers, varies, from, 220, million, to, a, maximum, number, of, 700, million, fishers, globally, which, is, thought, to, be, double, the, number, of, individuals, working, as, commercial, fishers, in, the, united, states, alone, it, was, estimated, that, 50, 1, million, people, engaged, in, fishing, activities, in, both, saltwater, and, freshwater, environments, big, game, fishing, is, fishing, from, boats, to, catch, large, open, water, species, such, as, swordfish, tuna, sharks, and, marlin, sportfishing, sometimes, game, fishing, is, recreational, fishing, where, the, primary, reward, is, the, challenge, of, finding, and, catching, the, fish, rather, than, the, culinary, or, financial, value, of, the, fish, s, flesh, fish, sought, after, include, tarpon, sailfish, mackerel, grouper, and, many, others, the, fishing, industry, includes, any, industry, or, activity, concerned, with, taking, culturing, processing, preserving, storing, transporting, marketing, or, selling, fish, or, fish, products, it, is, defined, by, the, fao, as, including, recreational, subsistence, and, commercial, fishing, and, the, harvesting, processing, and, marketing, sectors, the, commercial, activity, is, aimed, at, the, delivery, of, fish, and, other, seafood, products, for, human, consumption, or, use, as, raw, material, in, other, industrial, processes, there, are, three, principal, industry, sectors, commercial, fishing, is, the, capture, of, fish, for, commercial, purposes, those, who, practice, it, must, often, pursue, fish, far, from, the, land, under, adverse, conditions, commercial, fishermen, harvest, almost, all, aquatic, species, from, tuna, cod, and, salmon, to, shrimp, krill, lobster, clams, squid, and, crab, in, various, fisheries, for, these, species, commercial, fishing, methods, have, become, very, efficient, using, large, nets, and, sea, going, processing, factories, individual, fishing, quotas, and, international, treaties, seek, to, control, the, species, and, quantities, caught, a, commercial, fishing, enterprise, may, vary, from, one, man, with, a, small, boat, with, hand, casting, nets, or, a, few, pot, traps, to, a, huge, fleet, of, trawlers, processing, tons, of, fish, every, day, commercial, fishing, gear, includes, weights, nets, e, g, purse, seine, seine, nets, e, g, beach, seine, trawls, e, g, bottom, trawl, dredges, hooks, and, line, e, g, long, line, and, handline, lift, nets, gillnets, entangling, nets, and, traps, according, to, the, food, and, agriculture, organization, of, the, united, nations, the, total, world, capture, fisheries, production, in, 2000, was, 86, million, tons, fao, 2002, the, top, producing, countries, were, in, order, the, people, s, republic, of, china, excluding, hong, kong, and, taiwan, peru, japan, the, united, states, chile, indonesia, russia, india, thailand, norway, and, iceland, those, countries, accounted, for, more, than, half, of, the, world, s, production, china, alone, accounted, for, a, third, of, the, world, s, production, of, that, production, over, 90, was, marine, and, less, than, 10, was, inland, a, small, number, of, species, support, the, majority, of, the, world, s, fisheries, some, of, these, species, are, herring, cod, sardine, anchovy, tuna, flounder, mullet, squid, shrimp, salmon, crab, lobster, oyster, and, scallops, all, except, these, last, four, provided, a, worldwide, catch, of, well, over, a, million, tonnes, in, 1999, with, herring, and, sardines, together, providing, a, catch, of, over, 22, million, metric, tons, in, 1999, many, other, species, as, well, are, fished, in, smaller, numbers, fish, farming, is, the, principal, form, of, aquaculture, while, other, methods, may, fall, under, mariculture, it, involves, raising, fish, commercially, in, tanks, or, enclosures, usually, for, food, a, facility, that, releases, juvenile, fish, into, the, wild, for, recreational, fishing, or, to, supplement, a, species, natural, population, is, generally, referred, to, as, a, fish, hatchery, fish, species, raised, by, fish, farms, include, salmon, carp, tilapia, catfish, white, seabass, and, trout, increased, demands, on, wild, fisheries, by, commercial, fishing, has, caused, widespread, overfishing, fish, farming, offers, an, alternative, solution, to, the, increasing, market, demand, for, fish, fish, and, fish, products, are, consumed, as, food, all, over, the, world, with, other, seafoods, it, provides, the, world, s, prime, source, of, high, quality, protein, 14, 16, percent, of, the, animal, protein, consumed, worldwide, over, one, billion, people, rely, on, fish, as, their, primary, source, of, animal, protein, fish, and, other, aquatic, organisms, are, also, processed, into, various, food, and, non, food, products, such, as, sharkskin, leather, pigments, made, from, the, inky, secretions, of, cuttlefish, isinglass, used, for, the, clarification, of, wine, and, beer, fish, emulsion, used, as, a, fertiliser, fish, glue, fish, oil, and, fish, meal, fish, are, also, collected, live, for, research, and, the, aquarium, trade, fisheries, management, draws, on, fisheries, science, to, find, ways, to, protect, fishery, resources, so, sustainable, exploitation, is, possible, modern, fisheries, management, is, often, referred, to, as, a, governmental, system, of, hopefully, appropriate, management, rules, based, on, defined, objectives, and, a, mix, of, management, means, to, implement, the, rules, which, are, put, in, place, by, a, system, of, monitoring, control, and, surveillance, fisheries, science, is, the, academic, discipline, of, managing, and, understanding, fisheries, it, is, a, multidisciplinary, science, which, draws, on, the, disciplines, of, oceanography, marine, biology, marine, conservation, ecology, population, dynamics, economics, and, management, in, an, attempt, to, provide, an, integrated, picture, of, fisheries, in, some, cases, new, disciplines, have, emerged, such, as, bioeconomics, issues, involved, in, the, long, term, sustainability, of, fishing, include, overfishing, by, catch, marine, pollution, environmental, effects, of, fishing, climate, change, and, fish, farming, conservation, issues, are, part, of, marine, conservation, and, are, addressed, in, fisheries, science, programs, there, is, a, growing, gap, between, how, many, fish, are, available, to, be, caught, and, humanity, s, desire, to, catch, them, a, problem, that, gets, worse, as, the, world, population, grows, similar, to, other, environmental, issues, there, can, be, conflict, between, the, fishermen, who, depend, on, fishing, for, their, livelihoods, and, fishery, scientists, who, realise, that, if, future, fish, populations, are, to, be, sustainable, then, some, fisheries, must, limit, fishing, or, cease, operations, historically, some, doubted, that, fish, could, experience, pain, laboratory, experiments, have, shown, that, fish, do, react, to, painful, stimuli, e, g, injections, of, bee, venom, in, a, similar, way, to, mammals, this, is, controversial, and, has, been, disputed, the, expansion, of, fish, farming, as, well, as, animal, welfare, concerns, in, society, has, led, to, research, into, more, humane, and, faster, ways, of, killing, fish, in, large, scale, operations, like, fish, farms, stunning, fish, with, electricity, or, putting, them, into, water, saturated, with, nitrogen, so, that, they, cannot, breathe, results, in, death, more, rapidly, than, just, taking, them, out, of, the, water, for, sport, fishing, it, is, recommended, that, fish, be, killed, soon, after, catching, them, by, hitting, them, on, the, head, followed, by, bleeding, out, or, by, stabbing, the, brain, with, a, sharp, object, called, pithing, or, ike, jime, in, japanese, some, believe, it, is, not, cruel, if, you, release, the, catch, back, to, where, it, was, caught, however, a, study, in, 2018, states, that, the, hook, damages, an, important, part, of, the, feeding, mechanism, by, which, the, fish, sucks, in, food, ignoring, the, issue, of, pain, when, fishing, there, are, high, chances, of, catching, other, marine, wildlife, in, a, fishing, net, there, are, over, 100, different, fishing, regulations, on, paper, for, reducing, this, bycatch, abandoned, lost, or, otherwise, discarded, fishing, gear, includes, netting, mono, multifilament, lines, hooks, ropes, floats, buoys, sinkers, anchors, metallic, materials, and, fish, aggregating, devices, fads, made, of, non, biodegradable, materials, such, as, concrete, metal, and, polymers, it, has, been, estimated, that, global, fishing, gear, losses, each, year, include, 5, 7, of, all, fishing, nets, 8, 6, of, all, traps, and, 29, of, all, lines, used, abandoned, lost, or, otherwise, discarded, fishing, gear, aldfg, can, have, serious, impacts, on, marine, organisms, through, entanglement, and, ingestion, the, potential, for, fishing, gear, to, become, aldfg, depends, on, a, number, of,
