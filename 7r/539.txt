a, jury, is, a, sworn, body, of, people, jurors, convened, to, hear, evidence, make, findings, of, fact, and, render, an, impartial, verdict, officially, submitted, to, them, by, a, court, or, to, set, a, penalty, or, judgment, juries, developed, in, england, during, the, middle, ages, and, are, a, hallmark, of, the, english, common, law, system, they, are, commonly, used, in, countries, whose, legal, systems, derive, from, the, british, empire, such, as, the, united, kingdom, the, united, states, canada, australia, and, ireland, while, juries, are, not, used, in, most, other, countries, whose, legal, systems, based, upon, either, european, civil, law, or, islamic, sharia, law, their, use, has, been, growing, most, trial, juries, are, petit, juries, and, usually, consist, of, twelve, people, a, larger, jury, known, as, a, grand, jury, has, been, used, to, investigate, potential, crimes, and, render, indictments, against, suspects, the, petit, jury, or, trial, jury, sometimes, petty, jury, hears, the, evidence, in, a, trial, as, presented, by, both, the, plaintiff, petitioner, and, the, defendant, respondent, also, known, as, the, complainant, and, defendant, within, the, english, criminal, legal, system, after, hearing, the, evidence, and, often, jury, instructions, from, the, judge, the, group, retires, for, deliberation, to, consider, a, verdict, the, majority, required, for, a, verdict, varies, in, some, cases, it, must, be, unanimous, while, in, other, jurisdictions, it, may, be, a, majority, or, supermajority, a, jury, that, is, unable, to, come, to, a, verdict, is, referred, to, as, a, hung, jury, a, grand, jury, a, type, of, jury, now, confined, mostly, to, federal, courts, and, some, state, jurisdictions, in, the, united, states, and, liberia, determines, whether, there, is, enough, evidence, for, a, criminal, trial, to, go, forward, grand, juries, carry, out, this, duty, by, examining, evidence, presented, to, them, by, a, prosecutor, and, issuing, indictments, or, by, investigating, alleged, crimes, and, issuing, presentments, grand, juries, are, usually, larger, than, trial, juries, for, example, u, s, federal, grand, juries, have, between, 16, and, 23, members, the, fifth, amendment, to, the, u, s, constitution, guarantees, americans, the, constitutional, right, to, be, free, from, charges, for, capital, or, otherwise, infamous, crimes, unless, they, have, been, indicted, by, a, grand, jury, although, this, right, applies, only, to, federal, law, not, state, law, in, addition, to, their, primary, role, in, screening, criminal, prosecutions, and, assisting, in, the, investigation, of, crimes, grand, juries, in, california, florida, and, some, other, u, s, states, are, sometimes, utilized, to, perform, an, investigative, and, policy, audit, function, similar, to, that, filled, by, the, government, accountability, office, in, the, united, states, federal, government, and, legislative, state, auditors, in, many, u, s, states, in, ireland, and, other, countries, in, the, past, the, task, of, a, grand, jury, was, to, determine, whether, the, prosecutors, had, presented, a, true, bill, one, that, described, a, crime, and, gave, a, plausible, reason, for, accusing, the, named, person, another, kind, of, jury, known, as, a, coroner, s, jury, can, be, convened, in, some, common, law, jurisdiction, in, connection, with, an, inquest, by, a, coroner, a, coroner, is, a, public, official, often, an, elected, local, government, official, in, the, united, states, who, is, charged, with, determining, the, circumstances, leading, to, a, death, in, ambiguous, or, suspicious, cases, such, as, of, jeffrey, epstein, a, coroner, s, jury, is, generally, a, body, that, a, coroner, can, convene, on, an, optional, basis, in, order, to, increase, public, confidence, in, the, coroner, s, finding, where, there, might, otherwise, be, a, controversy, in, practice, coroner, s, juries, are, most, often, convened, in, order, to, avoid, the, appearance, of, impropriety, by, one, governmental, official, in, the, criminal, justice, system, toward, another, if, no, charges, are, filed, against, the, person, causing, the, death, when, a, governmental, party, such, as, a, law, enforcement, officer, is, involved, in, the, death, a, citizens, assembly, is, a, group, of, people, selected, by, lottery, from, the, general, population, to, deliberate, on, important, public, questions, so, as, to, exert, an, influence, other, types, of, deliberative, mini, publics, include, citizens, jury, citizens, panel, people, s, panel, people, s, jury, policy, jury, consensus, conference, and, citizens, convention, a, citizens, assembly, uses, elements, of, a, jury, to, create, public, policy, its, members, form, a, representative, cross, section, of, the, public, and, are, provided, with, time, resources, and, a, broad, range, of, viewpoints, to, learn, deeply, about, an, issue, through, skilled, facilitation, the, assembly, members, weigh, trade, offs, and, work, to, find, common, ground, on, a, shared, set, of, recommendations, citizens, assemblies, can, be, more, representative, and, deliberative, than, public, engagement, polls, legislatures, or, ballot, initiatives, they, seek, quality, of, participation, over, quantity, they, also, have, added, advantages, in, issues, where, politicians, have, a, conflict, of, interest, such, as, initiatives, that, will, not, show, benefits, before, the, next, election, or, decisions, that, impact, the, types, of, income, politicians, can, receive, they, also, are, particularly, well, suited, to, complex, issues, with, trade, offs, and, values, driven, dilemmas, the, modern, jury, evolved, out, of, the, ancient, custom, of, many, ancient, germanic, tribes, whereby, a, group, of, men, of, certain, social, standing, was, used, to, investigate, crimes, and, judge, the, accused, the, same, custom, evolved, into, the, vehmic, court, system, in, medieval, germany, in, anglo, saxon, england, juries, investigated, crimes, after, the, norman, conquest, some, parts, of, the, country, preserved, juries, as, the, means, of, investigating, crimes, the, use, of, ordinary, members, of, the, community, to, consider, crimes, was, unusual, in, ancient, cultures, but, was, nonetheless, also, found, in, ancient, greece, the, modern, jury, trial, evolved, out, of, this, custom, in, the, mid, 12th, century, during, the, reign, of, henry, ii, juries, usually, 6, or, 12, men, were, an, ancient, institution, even, then, in, some, parts, of, england, at, the, same, time, as, members, consisted, of, representatives, of, the, basic, units, of, local, government, hundreds, an, administrative, sub, division, of, the, shire, embracing, several, vills, and, villages, called, juries, of, presentment, these, men, testified, under, oath, to, crimes, committed, in, their, neighbourhood, the, assize, of, clarendon, in, 1166, caused, these, juries, to, be, adopted, systematically, throughout, the, country, the, jury, in, this, period, was, self, informing, meaning, it, heard, very, little, evidence, or, testimony, in, court, instead, jurors, were, recruited, from, the, locality, of, the, dispute, and, were, expected, to, know, the, facts, before, coming, to, court, the, source, of, juror, knowledge, could, include, first, hand, knowledge, investigation, and, less, reliable, sources, such, as, rumour, and, hearsay, between, 1166, and, 1179, new, procedures, including, a, division, of, functions, between, the, sheriff, the, jury, of, local, men, and, the, royal, justices, ushered, in, the, era, of, the, english, common, law, sheriffs, prepared, cases, for, trial, and, found, jurors, with, relevant, knowledge, and, testimony, jurors, found, a, verdict, by, witnessing, as, to, fact, even, assessing, and, applying, information, from, their, own, and, community, memory, little, was, written, at, this, time, and, what, was, such, as, deeds, and, writs, were, subject, to, fraud, royal, justices, supervised, trials, answered, questions, as, to, law, and, announced, the, court, s, decision, which, was, then, subject, to, appeal, sheriffs, executed, the, decision, of, the, court, these, procedures, enabled, henry, ii, to, delegate, authority, without, endowing, his, subordinates, with, too, much, power, 293, in, 1215, the, catholic, church, removed, its, sanction, from, all, forms, of, the, ordeal, procedures, by, which, suspects, up, to, that, time, were, tested, as, to, guilt, e, g, in, the, ordeal, of, hot, metal, molten, metal, was, sometimes, poured, into, a, suspected, thief, s, hand, if, the, wound, healed, rapidly, and, well, it, was, believed, god, found, the, suspect, innocent, and, if, not, then, the, suspect, was, found, guilty, with, trial, by, ordeal, banned, establishing, guilt, would, have, been, problematic, had, england, not, had, forty, years, of, judicial, experience, justices, were, by, then, accustomed, to, asking, jurors, of, presentment, about, points, of, fact, in, assessing, indictments, it, was, a, short, step, to, ask, jurors, if, they, concluded, the, accused, was, guilty, as, charged, 358, the, so, called, wantage, code, provides, an, early, reference, to, a, jury, like, group, in, england, wherein, a, decree, issued, by, king, thelred, the, unready, at, wantage, c, 997, provided, that, in, every, hundred, the, twelve, leading, thegns, together, with, the, reeve, shall, go, out, and, swear, on, the, relics, which, are, given, into, their, hands, that, they, will, not, accuse, any, innocent, man, nor, shield, a, guilty, one, the, resulting, wantage, code, formally, recognized, legal, customs, that, were, part, of, the, danelaw, the, testimonial, concept, can, also, be, traced, to, normandy, before, 1066, when, a, jury, of, nobles, was, established, to, decide, land, disputes, in, this, manner, the, duke, being, the, largest, land, owner, could, not, act, as, a, judge, in, his, own, case, one, of, the, earliest, antecedents, of, modern, jury, systems, is, the, jury, in, ancient, greece, including, the, city, state, of, athens, where, records, of, jury, courts, date, back, to, 500, bce, these, juries, voted, by, secret, ballot, and, were, eventually, granted, the, power, to, annul, unconstitutional, laws, thus, introducing, the, practice, of, judicial, review, in, modern, justice, systems, the, law, is, considered, self, contained, and, distinct, from, other, coercive, forces, and, perceived, as, separate, from, the, political, life, of, the, community, but, all, these, barriers, are, absent, in, the, context, of, classical, athens, in, practice, and, in, conception, the, law, and, its, administration, are, in, some, important, respects, indistinguishable, from, the, life, of, the, community, in, general, in, juries, of, the, justices, in, eyre, the, bailiff, of, the, hundred, would, choose, 4, electors, who, in, turn, chose, 12, others, from, their, hundred, and, from, these, were, selected, 12, jurors, from, the, 17th, century, until, 1898, in, ireland, grand, juries, also, functioned, as, local, government, authorities, in, 1730, the, british, parliament, passed, the, bill, for, better, regulation, of, juries, the, act, stipulated, that, the, list, of, all, those, liable, for, jury, service, was, to, be, posted, in, each, parish, and, that, jury, panels, would, be, selected, by, lot, also, known, as, sortition, from, these, lists, its, aim, was, to, prevent, middle, class, citizens, from, evading, their, responsibilities, by, financially, putting, into, question, the, neutrality, of, the, under, sheriff, the, official, entrusted, with, impaneling, juries, prior, to, the, act, the, main, means, of, ensuring, impartiality, was, by, allowing, legal, challenges, to, the, sheriff, s, choices, the, new, provisions, did, not, specifically, aim, at, establishing, impartiality, but, had, the, effect, of, reinforcing, the, authority, of, the, jury, by, guaranteeing, impartiality, at, the, point, of, selection, in, some, american, colonies, such, as, in, new, england, and, virginia, and, less, often, in, england, juries, also, handed, down, rulings, on, the, law, in, addition, to, rulings, on, the, facts, of, the, case, the, american, grand, jury, was, also, indispensable, to, the, american, revolution, by, challenging, the, crown, and, parliament, including, by, indicting, british, soldiers, refusing, to, indict, people, who, criticized, the, crown, proposing, boycotts, and, called, for, the, support, of, the, war, after, the, declaration, of, independence, in, the, late, 18th, century, english, and, colonial, civil, criminal, and, grand, juries, played, major, roles, in, checking, the, power, of, the, executive, the, legislature, and, the, judiciary, in, 1825, the, rules, concerning, juror, selection, in, england, were, consolidated, property, qualifications, and, various, other, rules, were, standardised, although, an, exemption, was, left, open, for, towns, which, possessed, their, own, courts, this, reflected, a, more, general, understanding, that, local, officials, retained, a, large, amount, of, discretion, regarding, which, people, they, actually, summoned, in, the, late, eighteenth, century, king, has, found, evidence, of, butchers, being, excluded, from, service, in, essex, while, crosby, has, found, evidence, of, peripatetic, ice, cream, vendors, not, being, summoned, in, the, summer, time, as, late, as, 1923, with, the, adoption, of, the, juries, act, ireland, 1871, property, qualifications, for, irish, jurors, were, partially, standardized, and, lowered, so, that, jurors, were, drawn, from, among, men, who, paid, above, a, certain, amount, of, taxes, for, poor, relief, this, expanded, the, number, of, potential, jurors, even, though, only, a, small, minority, of, irish, people, were, eligible, to, serve, until, the, 1870s, jurors, in, england, and, ireland, worked, under, the, rule, that, they, could, not, leave, eat, drink, or, have, a, fire, to, warm, themselves, by, though, they, could, take, medicine, this, rule, appears, to, have, been, imposed, with, the, idea, that, hungry, jurors, would, be, quicker, to, compromise, so, they, could, reach, a, verdict, and, therefore, eat, jurors, who, broke, the, rule, by, smuggling, in, food, were, sometimes, fined, and, occasionally, especially, if, the, food, were, believed, to, come, from, one, of, the, parties, in, the, case, the, verdict, was, quashed, later, in, the, century, jurors, who, did, not, reach, a, verdict, on, the, first, day, were, no, longer, required, to, sleep, in, the, courthouse, but, were, sometimes, put, up, at, the, expense, of, the, parties, in, the, trial, at, a, hotel, after, 1919, in, england, women, were, no, longer, excluded, from, jury, service, by, virtue, of, their, sex, although, they, still, had, to, satisfy, the, ordinary, property, qualifications, the, exemption, which, had, been, created, by, the, 1825, act, for, towns, which, possessed, their, own, courts, meant, ten, towns, were, free, to, ignore, the, property, qualifications, this, amplified, in, these, towns, the, general, understanding, that, local, officials, had, a, free, hand, in, summoning, freely, from, among, those, people, who, were, qualified, to, be, jurors, in, 1920, three, of, these, ten, towns, leicester, lincoln, and, nottingham, consistently, empanelled, assize, juries, of, six, men, and, six, women, while, at, the, bristol, exeter, and, norwich, assizes, no, women, were, empanelled, at, all, this, quickly, led, to, a, tightening, up, of, the, rules, and, an, abolition, of, these, ten, towns, discretion, after, 1922, trial, juries, throughout, england, had, to, satisfy, the, same, qualifications, although, it, was, not, until, the, 1980s, that, a, centralised, system, was, designed, for, selecting, jurors, from, among, the, people, who, were, qualified, to, serve, this, meant, there, was, still, a, great, amount, of, discretion, in, the, hands, of, local, officials, potential, jurors, are, summoned, to, the, courthouse, for, service, in, the, past, jurors, were, identified, manually, by, local, authorities, making, lists, of, men, they, believed, to, be, eligible, for, service, in, 19th, century, ireland, the, list, of, eligible, jurors, in, each, court, district, was, alphabetized, and, in, the, later, part, of, the, century, the, sheriff, was, required, to, summon, one, potential, juror, from, each, letter, of, the, alphabet, repeating, as, needed, until, a, sufficient, number, of, men, had, been, summoned, usually, between, 36, and, 60, men, for, the, quarterly, assizes, normally, the, sheriff, or, a, constable, went, to, each, juror, s, home, to, show, him, the, summons, paperwork, venire, facias, de, novo, it, wasn, t, until, 1871, that, any, irish, jurors, could, be, summoned, by, mail, in, modern, times, juries, are, often, initially, chosen, randomly, usually, from, large, databases, identifying, the, eligible, population, of, adult, citizens, residing, in, the, court, s, jurisdictional, area, e, g, identity, cards, drivers, licenses, tax, records, or, similar, systems, and, summons, are, delivered, by, mail, in, the, past, qualifications, included, things, like, being, an, adult, male, having, a, good, reputation, in, the, community, and, owning, land, modern, requirements, may, include, being, a, citizen, of, that, country, and, having, a, fluent, understanding, of, the, language, used, during, the, trial, in, addition, to, a, minimum, age, some, countries, have, a, maximum, age, some, countries, disqualify, people, who, have, been, previously, convicted, of, a, crime, or, excuse, them, on, various, grounds, such, as, being, ill, or, holding, certain, jobs, or, offices, serving, on, a, jury, is, normally, compulsory, for, individuals, who, are, qualified, for, jury, service, skipping, service, may, be, inevitable, in, a, small, number, of, cases, as, a, summoned, juror, might, become, ill, or, otherwise, become, unexpectedly, unable, to, appear, at, the, court, however, a, significant, fraction, of, summoned, jurors, may, fail, to, appear, for, other, reasons, in, 1874, there, was, a, report, that, one, third, of, summoned, irish, jurors, failed, to, appear, in, court, when, an, insufficient, number, of, summoned, jurors, appear, in, court, to, handle, a, matter, the, law, in, many, jurisdictions, empowers, the, jury, commissioner, or, other, official, convening, the, jury, to, involuntarily, impress, bystanders, in, the, vicinity, of, the, place, where, the, jury, is, to, be, convened, to, serve, on, the, jury, as, the, concept, of, a, jury, was, spread, through, the, british, empire, first, to, ireland, and, then, to, other, countries, the, size, of, the, jury, was, one, of, the, details, that, was, adapted, to, the, local, culture, the, tradition, in, england, was, to, have, twelve, jurors, but, other, countries, use, smaller, juries, and, some, such, as, scotland, use, larger, juries, the, size, of, the, jury, is, to, provide, a, cross, section, of, the, public, in, williams, v, florida, 399, u, s, 78, 1970, the, supreme, court, of, the, united, states, ruled, that, a, florida, state, jury, of, six, was, sufficient, that, the, 12, man, panel, is, not, a, necessary, ingredient, of, trial, by, jury, and, that, respondent, s, refusal, to, impanel, more, than, the, six, members, provided, for, by, florida, law, did, not, violate, petitioner, s, sixth, amendment, rights, as, applied, to, the, states, through, the, fourteenth, in, ballew, v, georgia, 435, u, s, 223, 1978, the, supreme, court, ruled, that, the, number, of, jurors, could, not, be, reduced, below, six, in, brownlee, v, the, queen, 2001, 207, clr, 278, the, high, court, of, australia, unanimously, held, that, a, jury, of, 12, members, was, not, an, essential, feature, of, trial, by, jury, in, section, 80, of, the, australian, constitution, in, scotland, a, jury, in, a, criminal, trial, consists, of, 15, jurors, which, is, thought, to, be, the, largest, in, the, world, in, 2009, a, review, by, the, scottish, government, regarding, the, possibility, of, reduction, led, to, the, decision, to, retain, 15, jurors, with, the, cabinet, secretary, for, justice, stating, that, after, extensive, consultation, he, had, decided, that, scotland, had, got, it, uniquely, right, trials, in, the, republic, of, ireland, which, are, scheduled, to, last, over, 2, months, can, but, do, not, have, to, have, 15, jurors, a, study, by, the, university, of, glasgow, suggested, that, a, civil, jury, of, 12, people, was, ineffective, because, a, few, jurors, ended, up, dominating, the, discussion, and, that, seven, was, a, better, number, because, more, people, feel, comfortable, speaking, and, they, have, an, easier, time, reaching, a, unanimous, decision, jurors, are, expected, to, be, neutral, so, the, court, may, inquire, about, the, jurors, neutrality, or, otherwise, exclude, jurors, who, are, perceived, as, likely, to, be, less, than, neutral, or, partial, to, one, side, jury, selection, in, the, united, states, usually, includes, organized, questioning, of, the, prospective, jurors, jury, pool, by, the, lawyers, for, the, plaintiff, and, the, defendant, and, by, the, judge, voir, dire, as, well, as, rejecting, some, jurors, because, of, bias, or, inability, to, properly, serve, challenge, for, cause, and, the, discretionary, right, of, each, side, to, reject, a, specified, number, of, jurors, without, having, to, prove, a, proper, cause, for, the, rejection, peremptory, challenge, before, the, jury, is, impaneled, since, there, is, always, the, possibility, of, jurors, not, completing, a, trial, for, health, or, other, reasons, often, one, or, more, alternate, jurors, may, be, selected, alternates, are, present, for, the, entire, trial, but, do, not, take, part, in, deliberating, the, case, and, deciding, the, verdict, unless, one, or, more, of, the, impaneled, jurors, are, removed, from, the, jury, for, example, in, the, united, kingdom, a, small, number, of, alternate, jurors, may, be, empanelled, until, the, end, of, the, opening, speeches, by, counsel, in, case, a, juror, realises, they, are, familiar, with, the, matters, before, the, court, jurors, are, selected, from, a, jury, pool, formed, for, a, specified, period, of, time, usually, from, one, day, to, two, weeks, from, lists, of, citizens, living, in, the, jurisdiction, of, the, court, the, lists, may, be, electoral, rolls, i, e, a, list, of, registered, voters, in, the, locale, people, who, have, driver, s, licenses, or, other, relevant, data, bases, when, selected, being, a, member, of, a, jury, pool, is, in, principle, compulsory, prospective, jurors, are, sent, a, summons, and, are, obligated, to, appear, in, a, specified, jury, pool, room, on, a, specified, date, however, jurors, can, be, released, from, the, pool, for, several, reasons, including, illness, prior, commitments, that, cannot, be, abandoned, without, hardship, change, of, address, to, outside, the, court, s, jurisdiction, travel, or, employment, outside, the, jurisdiction, at, the, time, of, duty, and, others, often, jurisdictions, pay, token, amounts, for, jury, duty, and, many, issue, stipends, to, cover, transportation, expenses, for, jurors, work, places, cannot, penalize, employees, who, serve, jury, duty, payments, to, jurors, varies, by, jurisdiction, in, the, united, states, jurors, for, grand, juries, are, selected, from, jury, pools, selection, of, jurors, from, a, jury, pool, occurs, when, a, trial, is, announced, and, juror, names, are, randomly, selected, and, called, out, by, the, jury, pool, clerk, depending, on, the, type, of, trial, whether, a, 6, person, or, 12, person, jury, is, needed, in, the, united, states, anywhere, from, 15, to, 30, prospective, jurors, are, sent, to, the, courtroom, to, participate, in, voir, dire, pronounced, in, french, the, oath, to, speak, the, truth, in, the, examination, testing, competence, of, a, juror, or, in, another, application, a, witness, once, the, list, of, prospective, jurors, has, assembled, in, the, courtroom, the, court, clerk, assigns, them, seats, in, the, order, their, names, were, originally, drawn, at, this, point, the, judge, often, will, ask, each, prospective, juror, to, answer, a, list, of, general, questions, such, as, name, occupation, education, family, relationships, time, conflicts, for, the, anticipated, length, of, the, trial, the, list, is, usually, written, up, and, clearly, visible, to, assist, nervous, prospective, jurors, and, may, include, several, questions, uniquely, pertinent, to, the, particular, trial, these, questions, are, to, familiarize, the, judge, and, attorneys, with, the, jurors, and, glean, biases, experiences, or, relationships, that, could, jeopardize, the, proper, course, of, the, trial, after, each, prospective, juror, has, answered, the, general, slate, of, questions, the, attorneys, may, ask, follow, up, questions, of, some, or, all, prospective, jurors, each, side, in, the, trial, is, allotted, a, certain, number, of, challenges, to, remove, prospective, jurors, from, consideration, some, challenges, are, issued, during, voir, dire, while, others, are, presented, to, the, judge, at, the, end, of, voir, dire, the, judge, calls, out, the, names, of, the, anonymously, challenged, prospective, jurors, and, those, return, to, the, pool, for, consideration, in, other, trials, a, jury, is, formed, then, of, the, remaining, prospective, jurors, in, the, order, that, their, names, were, originally, chosen, any, prospective, jurors, not, thus, impaneled, return, to, the, jury, pool, room, a, jury, is, intended, to, be, an, impartial, panel, capable, of, reaching, a, verdict, and, representing, a, variety, of, people, from, that, area, achieving, this, goal, can, be, difficult, when, juror, qualifications, differ, significantly, from, the, people, living, in, that, area, for, example, in, 19th, century, ireland, the, qualified, jurors, were, much, wealthier, much, less, likely, to, be, roman, catholic, and, much, less, likely, to, speak, only, the, irish, language, than, the, typical, irish, person, in, the, past, england, had, special, juries, which, empaneled, only, wealthier, property, owners, as, jurors, attacks, on, the, american, jury, increased, after, the, pool, of, jurors, expanded, to, include, newly, enfranchised, women, and, minorities, a, head, juror, is, called, the, foreperson, foreman, or, presiding, juror, the, foreperson, may, be, chosen, before, the, trial, begins, or, at, the, beginning, of, the, jury, s, deliberations, the, foreperson, may, be, selected, by, the, judge, or, by, vote, of, the, jurors, depending, on, the, jurisdiction, the, foreperson, s, role, may, include, asking, questions, usually, to, the, judge, on, behalf, of, the, jury, facilitating, jury, discussions, and, announcing, the, verdict, of, the, jury, for, juries, to, fulfill, their, role, of, analyzing, the, facts, of, the, case, there, are, strict, rules, about, their, use, of, information, during, the, trial, juries, are, often, instructed, to, avoid, learning, about, the, case, from, any, source, other, than, the, trial, for, example, from, media, or, the, internet, and, not, to, conduct, their, own, investigations, such, as, independently, visiting, a, crime, scene, parties, to, the, case, lawyers, and, witnesses, are, not, allowed, to, speak, with, a, member, of, the, jury, doing, these, things, may, constitute, reversible, error, rarely, such, as, in, very, high, profile, cases, the, court, may, order, a, jury, sequestered, for, the, deliberation, phase, or, for, the, entire, trial, jurors, are, generally, required, to, keep, their, deliberations, in, strict, confidence, during, the, trial, and, deliberations, and, in, some, jurisdictions, even, after, a, verdict, is, rendered, in, canadian, and, english, law, the, jury, s, deliberations, must, never, be, disclosed, outside, the, jury, even, years, after, the, case, to, repeat, parts, of, the, trial, or, verdict, is, considered, to, be, contempt, of, court, a, criminal, offense, in, the, united, states, confidentiality, is, usually, only, required, until, a, verdict, has, been, reached, and, jurors, have, sometimes, made, remarks, that, called, into, question, whether, a, verdict, was, properly, reached, in, australia, academics, are, permitted, to, scrutinize, the, jury, process, only, after, obtaining, a, certificate, or, approval, from, the, attorney, general, because, of, the, importance, of, preventing, undue, influence, on, a, jury, embracery, jury, intimidation, or, jury, tampering, like, witness, tampering, is, a, serious, crime, whether, attempted, through, bribery, threat, of, violence, or, other, means, at, various, points, in, history, when, threats, to, jurors, became, pervasive, the, right, to, jury, trial, has, been, revoked, such, as, during, the, 1880s, in, ireland, jurors, themselves, can, also, be, held, liable, if, they, deliberately, compromise, their, impartiality, depending, on, local, law, if, a, juror, takes, a, bribe, the, verdict, may, be, overturned, and, the, juror, may, be, fined, or, imprisoned, robert, burns, and, alexander, hamilton, argued, that, jurors, were, the, least, likely, decision, makers, to, be, corrupted, when, compared, to, judges, and, all, the, political, branches, the, role, of, the, jury, is, often, described, as, that, of, a, finder, of, fact, while, the, judge, is, usually, seen, as, having, the, sole, responsibility, of, interpreting, the, appropriate, law, and, instructing, the, jury, accordingly, the, jury, determines, the, truth, or, falsity, of, factual, allegations, and, renders, a, verdict, on, whether, a, criminal, defendant, is, guilty, or, a, civil, defendant, is, civilly, liable, sometimes, a, jury, makes, specific, findings, of, fact, in, what, is, called, a, special, verdict, a, verdict, without, specific, findings, of, fact, that, includes, only, findings, of, guilt, or, civil, liability, and, an, overall, amount, of, civil, damages, if, awarded, is, called, a, general, verdict, juries, are, often, justified, because, they, leaven, the, law, with, community, norms, a, jury, trial, verdict, in, a, case, is, binding, only, in, that, case, and, is, not, a, legally, binding, precedent, in, other, cases, for, example, it, would, be, possible, for, one, jury, to, find, that, particular, conduct, is, negligent, and, another, jury, to, find, that, the, conduct, is, not, negligent, without, either, verdict, being, legally, invalid, on, precisely, the, same, factual, evidence, of, course, no, two, witnesses, are, exactly, the, same, and, even, the, same, witness, will, not, express, testimony, in, exactly, the, same, way, twice, so, this, would, be, difficult, to, prove, it, is, the, role, of, the, judge, not, the, jury, to, determine, what, law, applies, to, a, particular, set, of, facts, however, occasionally, jurors, find, the, law, to, be, invalid, or, unfair, and, on, that, basis, acquit, the, defendant, regardless, of, the, evidence, presented, that, the, defendant, violated, the, law, this, is, commonly, referred, to, as, jury, nullification, of, law, or, simply, jury, nullification, when, there, is, no, jury, bench, trial, the, judge, makes, rulings, on, both, questions, of, law, and, of, fact, in, most, continental, european, jurisdictions, judges, have, more, power, in, a, trial, and, the, role, and, powers, of, a, jury, are, often, restricted, actual, jury, law, and, trial, procedures, differ, significantly, between, countries, the, collective, knowledge, and, deliberate, nature, of, juries, are, also, given, as, reasons, in, their, favor, detailed, interviews, with, jurors, after, they, rendered, verdicts, in, trials, involving, complex, expert, testimony, have, demonstrated, careful, and, critical, analysis, the, interviewed, jurors, clearly, recognized, that, the, experts, were, selected, within, an, adversary, process, they, employed, sensible, techniques, to, evaluate, the, experts, testimony, such, as, assessing, the, completeness, and, consistency, of, the, testimony, comparing, it, with, other, evidence, at, the, trial, and, evaluating, it, against, their, own, knowledge, and, life, experience, moreover, the, research, shows, that, in, deliberations, jurors, combine, their, individual, perspectives, on, the, evidence, and, debate, its, relative, merits, before, arriving, at, a, verdict, in, the, united, states, juries, are, sometimes, called, on, when, asked, to, do, so, by, a, judge, in, the, jury, instructions, to, make, factual, findings, on, particular, issues, this, may, include, for, example, aggravating, circumstances, which, will, be, used, to, elevate, the, defendant, s, sentence, if, the, defendant, is, convicted, this, practice, was, required, in, all, death, penalty, cases, in, blakely, v, washington, 542, u, s, 296, 2004, where, the, supreme, court, ruled, that, allowing, judges, to, make, such, findings, unilaterally, violates, the, sixth, amendment, right, to, a, jury, trial, a, similar, sixth, amendment, argument, in, apprendi, v, new, jersey, 530, u, s, 466, 2000, resulted, in, the, supreme, court, s, expansion, of, the, requirement, to, all, criminal, cases, holding, that, any, fact, that, increases, the, penalty, for, a, crime, beyond, the, prescribed, statutory, maximum, must, be, submitted, to, a, jury, and, proved, beyond, a, reasonable, doubt, many, u, s, jurisdictions, permit, the, seating, of, an, advisory, jury, in, a, civil, case, in, which, there, is, no, right, to, trial, by, jury, to, provide, non, binding, advice, to, the, trial, judge, although, this, procedural, tool, is, rarely, used, for, example, a, judge, might, seat, an, advisory, jury, to, guide, the, judge, in, awarding, non, economic, damages, such, as, pain, and, suffering, damages, in, a, case, where, there, is, no, right, to, a, jury, trial, such, as, depending, on, state, law, a, case, involving, equitable, rather, than, legal, claims, in, canada, juries, are, also, allowed, to, make, suggestions, for, sentencing, periods, at, the, time, of, sentencing, the, suggestions, of, the, jury, are, presented, before, the, judge, by, the, crown, prosecutor, s, before, the, sentence, is, handed, down, in, a, small, number, of, u, s, jurisdictions, including, the, states, of, tennessee, and, texas, juries, are, charged, both, with, the, task, of, finding, guilt, or, innocence, as, well, assessing, and, fixing, sentences, however, this, is, not, the, practice, in, most, other, legal, systems, based, on, the, english, tradition, in, which, judges, retain, sole, responsibility, for, deciding, sentences, according, to, law, the, exception, is, the, award, of, damages, in, english, law, libel, cases, although, a, judge, is, now, obliged, to, make, a, recommendation, to, the, jury, as, to, the, appropriate, amount, in, legal, systems, based, on, english, tradition, findings, of, fact, by, a, jury, and, jury, conclusions, that, could, be, supported, by, jury, findings, of, fact, even, if, the, specific, factual, basis, for, the, verdict, is, not, known, are, entitled, to, great, deference, on, appeal, in, other, legal, systems, it, is, generally, possible, for, an, appellate, court, to, reconsider, both, findings, of, fact, and, conclusions, of, law, made, in, the, trial, court, and, in, those, systems, evidence, may, be, presented, to, appellate, courts, in, what, amounts, to, a, trial, de, novo, new, trial, of, appealed, findings, of, fact, the, finality, of, trial, court, findings, of, fact, in, legal, systems, based, on, the, english, tradition, has, a, major, impact, on, court, procedure, in, these, systems, this, makes, it, imperative, that, lawyers, be, highly, prepared, for, trial, because, errors, and, misjudgments, related, to, the, presentation, of, evidence, at, trial, to, a, jury, cannot, generally, be, corrected, later, on, appeal, particularly, in, court, systems, based, on, the, english, tradition, the, higher, the, stakes, the, more, this, is, true, surprises, at, trial, are, much, more, consequential, in, court, systems, based, on, the, english, tradition, than, they, are, in, other, legal, systems, scholarly, research, on, jury, behavior, in, american, non, capital, criminal, felony, trials, reveals, that, juror, outcomes, appear, to, track, the, opinions, of, the, median, juror, rather, than, the, opinions, of, the, extreme, juror, on, the, panel, although, juries, were, required, to, render, unanimous, verdicts, in, the, jurisdictions, studied, thus, although, juries, must, render, unanimous, verdicts, in, run, of, the, mill, criminal, trials, they, behave, in, practice, as, if, they, were, operating, using, a, majority, rules, voting, system, jury, nullification, means, deciding, not, to, apply, the, law, to, the, facts, in, a, particular, case, by, jury, decision, in, other, words, it, is, the, process, whereby, a, jury, in, a, criminal, case, effectively, nullifies, a, law, by, acquitting, a, defendant, regardless, of, the, weight, of, evidence, against, him, or, her, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, there, was, a, series, of, such, cases, starting, in, 1670, with, the, trial, of, the, quaker, william, penn, which, asserted, the, de, facto, right, or, at, least, power, of, a, jury, to, render, a, verdict, contrary, to, the, facts, or, law, a, good, example, is, the, case, of, one, carnegie, of, finhaven, who, in, 1728, accidentally, killed, the, scottish, earl, of, strathmore, as, the, defendant, had, undoubtedly, killed, the, earl, the, law, as, it, stood, required, the, jury, to, render, the, verdict, that, the, case, had, been, proven, and, cause, carnegie, of, finhaven, to, die, for, an, accidental, killing, instead, the, jury, asserted, what, is, believed, to, be, their, ancient, right, to, judge, the, whole, case, and, not, just, the, facts, and, brought, in, the, verdict, of, not, guilty, today, in, the, united, states, juries, are, instructed, by, the, judge, to, follow, the, judge, s, instructions, concerning, what, is, the, law, and, to, render, a, verdict, solely, on, the, evidence, presented, in, court, important, past, exercises, of, nullification, include, cases, involving, slavery, see, fugitive, slave, act, of, 1850, freedom, of, the, press, see, john, peter, zenger, and, freedom, of, religion, see, william, penn, in, united, states, v, moylan, 417, f, 2d, 1002, 4th, cir, 1969, fourth, circuit, court, of, appeal, unanimously, ruled, if, the, jury, feels, that, the, law, under, which, the, defendant, is, accused, is, unjust, or, exigent, circumstances, justified, the, actions, of, the, accused, or, for, any, reason, which, appeals, to, their, logic, or, passion, the, jury, has, the, right, to, acquit, and, the, courts, must, abide, that, decision, the, fully, informed, jury, association, is, a, non, profit, educational, organization, dedicated, to, informing, jurors, of, their, rights, and, seeking, the, passage, of, laws, to, require, judges, to, inform, jurors, that, they, can, and, should, judge, the, law, in, sparf, v, united, states, 156, u, s, 51, 1895, the, supreme, court, in, a, 5, 4, decision, held, that, a, trial, judge, has, no, responsibility, to, inform, the, jury, of, the, right, to, nullify, laws, modern, american, jurisprudence, is, generally, intolerant, of, the, practice, and, a, juror, can, be, removed, from, a, case, if, the, judge, believes, that, the, juror, is, aware, of, the, power, of, nullification, in, the, united, kingdom, a, similar, power, exists, often, called, jury, equity, this, enables, a, jury, to, reach, a, decision, in, direct, contradiction, with, the, law, if, they, feel, the, law, is, unjust, this, can, create, a, persuasive, precedent, for, future, cases, or, render, prosecutors, reluctant, to, bring, a, charge, thus, a, jury, has, the, power, to, influence, the, law, the, standard, justification, of, jury, equity, is, taken, from, the, final, few, pages, of, lord, devlin, s, book, trial, by, jury, devlin, explained, jury, equity, through, two, now, famous, metaphors, that, the, jury, is, the, lamp, that, shows, that, freedom, lives, and, that, it, is, a, little, parliament, the, second, metaphor, emphasises, that, just, as, members, of, parliament, are, generally, dominated, by, government, but, can, occasionally, assert, their, independence, juries, are, usually, dominated, by, judges, but, can, in, extraordinary, circumstances, throw, off, this, control, devlin, thereby, sought, to, emphasise, that, neither, jury, equity, nor, judicial, control, is, set, in, stone, perhaps, the, best, example, of, modern, day, jury, equity, in, england, and, wales, was, the, acquittal, of, clive, ponting, on, a, charge, of, revealing, secret, information, under, section, 2, of, the, official, secrets, act, 1911, in, 1985, mr, ponting, s, defence, was, that, the, revelation, was, in, the, public, interest, the, trial, judge, directed, the, jury, that, the, public, interest, is, what, the, government, of, the, day, says, it, is, effectively, a, direction, to, the, jury, to, convict, nevertheless, the, jury, returned, a, verdict, of, not, guilty, another, example, is, the, acquittal, in, 1989, of, michael, randle, and, pat, pottle, who, confessed, in, open, court, to, charges, of, springing, the, soviet, spy, george, blake, from, wormwood, scrubs, prison, and, smuggling, him, to, east, germany, in, 1966, pottle, successfully, appealed, to, the, jury, to, disregard, the, judge, s, instruction, that, they, consider, only, whether, the, defendants, were, guilty, in, law, and, assert, a, jury, s, ancient, right, to, throw, out, a, politically, motivated, prosecution, in, this, case, compounded, by, its, cynical, untimeliness, in, scotland, with, a, separate, legal, system, from, that, of, england, and, wales, although, technically, the, not, guilty, verdict, was, originally, a, form, of, jury, nullification, over, time, the, interpretation, has, changed, so, that, now, the, not, guilty, verdict, has, become, the, normal, one, when, a, jury, is, not, persuaded, of, guilt, and, the, not, proven, verdict, is, only, used, when, the, jury, is, not, certain, of, innocence, or, guilt, it, is, absolutely, central, to, scottish, and, english, law, that, there, is, a, presumption, of, innocence, it, is, not, a, trivial, distinction, since, any, shift, in, the, burden, of, proof, is, a, significant, change, which, undermines, the, safeguard, for, the, citizen, jury, sentencing, is, the, practice, of, having, juries, decide, what, penalties, to, give, those, who, have, been, convicted, of, criminal, offenses, the, practice, of, jury, sentencing, began, in, the, us, state, of, virginia, in, the, 18th, century, and, spread, westward, to, other, states, that, were, influenced, by, virginia, trained, lawyers, canadian, juries, have, long, had, the, option, to, recommend, mercy, leniency, or, clemency, and, the, 1961, criminal, code, required, judges, to, give, a, jury, instruction, following, a, verdict, convicting, a, defendant, of, capital, murder, soliciting, a, recommendation, as, to, whether, he, should, be, granted, clemency, when, capital, punishment, in, canada, was, abolished, in, 1976, as, part, of, the, same, raft, of, reforms, the, criminal, code, was, also, amended, to, grant, juries, the, ability, to, recommend, periods, of, parole, ineligibility, immediately, following, a, guilty, verdict, in, second, degree, murder, cases, however, these, recommendations, are, usually, ignored, based, on, the, idea, that, judges, are, better, informed, about, relevant, facts, and, sentencing, jurisprudence, and, unlike, the, jury, permitted, to, give, reasons, for, their, judgments, proponents, of, jury, sentencing, argue, that, since, sentencing, involves, fact, finding, a, task, traditionally, within, the, purview, of, juries, and, since, the, original, intent, of, the, founders, was, to, have, juries, check, judges, power, it, is, the, proper, role, of, juries, to, participate, in, sentencing, opponents, argue, that, judges, training, and, experience, with, the, use, of, presentence, reports, and, sentencing, guidelines, as, well, as, the, fact, that, jury, control, procedures, typically, deprive, juries, of, the, opportunity, to, hear, information, about, the, defendant, s, background, during, the, trial, make, it, more, practical, to, have, judges, sentence, defendants, in, canada, a, faint, hope, clause, formerly, allowed, a, jury, to, be, empanelled, to, consider, whether, an, offender, s, number, of, years, of, imprisonment, without, eligibility, for, parole, ought, to, be, reduced, but, this, was, repealed, in, 2011, sentencing, is, said, to, be, more, time, consuming, for, jurors, than, the, relatively, easy, task, of, ascertaining, guilt, or, innocence, which, means, an, increase, in, jury, fees, and, in, the, amount, of, productivity, lost, to, jury, duty, in, new, south, wales, a, 2007, proposal, by, chief, justice, jim, spigelman, to, involve, juries, in, sentencing, was, rejected, after, district, court, chief, judge, reg, blanch, cited, an, expected, wide, difference, of, views, between, jurors, about, questions, relating, to, sentence, concerns, about, jury, tampering, through, intimidation, by, defendants, were, also, raised, germany, and, many, other, continental, european, countries, have, a, system, in, which, professional, judges, and, lay, judges, deliberate, together, at, both, the, trial, and, sentencing, stages, such, systems, have, been, praised, as, a, superior, alternative, because, the, mixed, court, dispenses, with, most, of, the, time, consuming, practices, of, jury, control, that, characterize, anglo, american, trial, procedure, yet, serves, the, purposes, of, a, jury, trial, better, than, plea, bargaining, and, bench, trials, which, have, displaced, the, jury, from, routine, american, practice, the, experience, of, individual, jurors, is, understudied, however, during, times, of, political, unrest, jurors, have, been, criminally, threatened, or, physically, harmed, because, of, their, service, and, this, resulted, in, people, being, less, willing, to, serve, or, to, prefer, the, risk, of, judicial, fines, for, not, serving, to, the, risk, of, criminal, retribution, if, they, do, serve, on, the, jury, jurors, typically, take, their, roles, very, seriously, according, to, simon, 1980, jurors, approach, their, responsibilities, as, decision, makers, much, in, the, same, way, as, a, court, judge, with, great, seriousness, a, lawful, mind, and, a, concern, for, consistency, that, is, evidence, based, by, actively, processing, evidence, making, inferences, using, common, sense, and, personal, experiences, to, inform, their, decision, making, research, has, indicated, that, jurors, are, effective, decision, makers, who, seek, thorough, understanding, rather, than, passive, apathetic, participants, unfit, to, serve, on, a, jury, contemporary, research, has, provided, partial, support, for, the, proficiency, of, juries, as, decision, makers, due, to, taking, their, work, seriously, to, get, a, fair, outcome, and, by, relying, on, the, group, to, overcome, individual, biases, some, note, the, imperfections, in, the, process, and, advocate, for, amendments, to, the, system, with, only, 3, of, us, judges, favoring, abolishing, the, jury, the, thoroughness, of, the, jury, trial, has, also, been, praised, for, providing, the, public, with, important, information, that, is, often, not, released, in, alternative, procedures, like, arbitration, or, adjudication, by, judges, or, administrative, agencies, evidence, supporting, jury, effectiveness, has, also, been, illustrated, in, studies, that, investigate, the, parallels, between, judge, and, jury, decision, making, according, to, kalven, and, zeisel, 1966, it, is, not, uncommon, to, find, that, the, verdicts, passed, down, by, juries, following, a, trial, match, the, verdicts, held, by, the, appointed, judges, upon, surveying, judges, and, jurors, of, approximately, 8, 000, criminal, and, civil, trials, it, was, discovered, that, the, verdicts, handed, down, by, both, parties, were, in, agreement, 80, of, the, time, suja, a, thomas, argues, that, although, results, between, judges, and, juries, may, be, similar, judges, and, juries, can, disagree, if, a, choice, must, be, made, between, a, judge, or, a, jury, deciding, the, diversity, availability, of, deliberations, the, requirement, for, consensus, the, lack, of, monetary, or, promotion, incentives, and, the, fresh, examination, of, evidence, all, make, the, jury, the, most, attractive, least, biased, decision, maker, jurors, like, most, individuals, are, not, free, from, holding, social, and, cognitive, biases, people, may, negatively, judge, individuals, who, do, not, adhere, to, established, social, norms, e, g, an, individual, s, dress, sense, or, do, not, meet, societal, standards, of, success, although, these, biases, tend, to, influence, jurors, individual, decisions, during, a, trial, while, working, as, part, of, a, group, i, e, jury, these, biases, are, typically, controlled, groups, tend, to, exert, buffering, effects, that, allow, jurors, to, disregard, their, initial, personal, biases, when, forming, a, credible, group, decision, analysis, of, over, a, quarter, million, felony, cases, in, usa, found, for, grand, juries, no, statistical, significance, for, taste, based, or, statistical, discrimination, between, black, and, white, defendants, robert, burns, cites, plato, in, arguing, that, gaining, power, and, ruling, wisely, are, different, skillsets, making, the, case, for, a, jury, of, those, who, have, not, sought, power, to, create, better, outcomes, than, trials, left, up, to, judges, burns, further, argues, that, interest, groups, have, increasing, influence, over, political, branches, including, judges, and, that, the, jury, was, designed, to, resist, the, new, gilded, age, level, concentration, of, power, he, also, cites, blackstone, who, argued, that, it, was, against, human, nature, for, the, few, judges, to, be, attentive, to, the, needs, of, the, many, he, also, argues, the, legitimacy, of, the, judiciary, increases, with, a, more, robust, jury, the, trial, also, provides, the, public, with, insight, into, the, conduct, of, judges, and, the, parties, involved, further, encouraging, good, behavior, unlike, in, other, major, institutions, that, run, on, a, more, bureaucratic, utilitarian, logic, the, jury, checks, this, way, of, thinking, by, bringing, common, sense, and, moral, perspectives, to, bear, burns, contrasts, the, focus, on, fact, for, a, jury, with, other, political, processes, like, congressional, forums, which, he, argues, are, undisciplined, forums, for, overbroad, abstractions, lastly, burns, argues, the, jury, is, a, vote, of, confidence, for, democracy, as, the, most, democratic, institution, at, least, in, america, and, one, that, demonstrates, that, it, is, possible, to, find, common, ground, on, difficult, questions, especially, when, decisions, must, be, unanimous, overall, jury, use, has, been, increasing, worldwide, in, ghana, juries, have, seven, members, and, their, sole, duty, is, to, determine, whether, the, person, is, guilty, they, have, no, role, in, sentencing, the, constitution, of, brazil, provides, that, only, willful, crimes, against, life, namely, full, or, attempted, murder, abortion, infanticide, and, suicide, instigation, be, judged, by, juries, seven, jurors, vote, in, secret, to, decide, whether, the, defendant, is, guilty, or, not, and, decisions, are, taken, by, the, majority, manslaughter, and, other, crimes, in, which, the, killing, was, committed, without, intent, however, are, judged, by, a, professional, judge, instead, in, canada, juries, are, used, for, some, criminal, trials, but, not, others, for, summary, conviction, offences, or, offences, found, under, section, 553, of, the,

can, elect, to, be, tried, by, either, a, judge, alone, or, a, judge, and, jury, in, the, most, serious, offences, found, in, section, 469, of, the, criminal, code, such, as, murder, or, treason, a, judge, and, a, jury, are, always, used, unless, both, the, accused, and, the, prosecutor, agree, that, the, trial, should, not, be, in, front, of, a, jury, the, jury, s, verdict, on, the, ultimate, disposition, of, guilt, or, innocence, must, be, unanimous, but, can, disagree, on, the, evidentiary, route, that, leads, to, that, disposition, juries, do, not, make, a, recommendation, as, to, the, length, of, sentence, except, for, parole, ineligibility, for, second, degree, murder, but, the, judge, is, not, bound, by, the, jury, s, recommendation, and, the, jury, is, not, required, to, make,

direct, that, one, or, two, alternate, jurors, also, be, appointed, if, a, juror, is, discharged, during, the, course, of, the, trial, the, trial, will, continue, with, an, alternate, juror, unless, the, number, of, jurors, goes, below, 10, the, canadian, charter, of, rights, and, freedoms, guarantees, that, anyone, tried, for, an, offense, that, has, a, maximum, sentence, of, five, or, more, years, has, the, right, to, be, tried, by, a, jury, except, for, an, offence, under, military, law, the, names, of, jurors, are, protected, by, a, publication, ban, there, is, a, specific, criminal, offense, for, disclosing, anything, that, takes, place, during, jury, deliberations, juries, are, infrequently, used, in, civil, trials, in, canada, there, are, no, civil, juries, in, the, courts, of, the, province, of, quebec, nor, in, the, federal, court, in, criminal, law, in, federal, courts, and, a, minority, of, state, court, systems, of, the, united, states, a, grand, jury, is, convened, to, hear, only, testimony, and, evidence, to, determine, whether, there, is, a, sufficient, basis, for, deciding, to, indict, the, defendant, and, proceed, toward, trial, in, each, court, district, where, a, grand, jury, is, required, a, group, of, 16, 23, citizens, holds, an, inquiry, on, criminal, complaints, brought, by, the, prosecutor, to, decide, whether, a, trial, is, warranted, based, on, the, standard, that, probable, cause, exists, that, a, crime, was, committed, in, which, case, an, indictment, is, issued, in, jurisdictions, where, the, size, of, a, jury, varies, in, general, the, size, of, juries, tends, to, be, larger, if, the, crime, alleged, is, more, serious, if, a, grand, jury, rejects, a, proposed, indictment, the, grand, jury, s, action, is, known, as, a, no, bill, if, they, accept, a, proposed, indictment, the, grand, jury, s, action, is, known, as, a, true, bill, grand, jury, proceedings, are, ex, parte, only, the, prosecutor, and, witnesses, who, the, prosecutor, calls, may, present, evidence, to, the, grand, jury, and, defendants, are, not, allowed, to, present, mitigating, evidence, or, even, to, know, the, testimony, that, was, presented, to, the, grand, jury, and, hearsay, evidence, is, permitted, this, is, so, because, a, grand, jury, cannot, convict, a, defendant, it, can, only, decide, to, indict, the, defendant, and, proceed, forward, toward, trial, grand, juries, vote, to, indict, in, the, overwhelming, majority, of, cases, and, prosecutors, are, not, prohibited, from, presenting, the, same, case, to, a, new, grand, jury, if, a, no, bill, was, returned, by, a, previous, grand, jury, a, typical, grand, jury, considers, a, new, criminal, case, every, fifteen, minutes, in, some, jurisdictions, in, addition, to, indicting, persons, for, crimes, a, grand, jury, may, also, issue, reports, on, matters, that, they, investigate, apart, from, the, criminal, indictments, particularly, when, the, grand, jury, investigation, involves, a, public, scandal, historically, grand, juries, were, sometimes, used, in, american, law, to, serve, a, purpose, similar, to, an, investigatory, commission, both, article, iii, of, the, u, s, constitution, and, the, sixth, amendment, require, that, criminal, cases, be, tried, by, a, jury, originally, this, applied, only, to, federal, courts, however, the, fourteenth, amendment, extended, this, mandate, to, the, states, although, the, constitution, originally, did, not, require, a, jury, for, civil, cases, this, led, to, an, uproar, which, was, followed, by, adoption, of, the, seventh, amendment, which, requires, a, civil, jury, in, cases, where, the, value, in, dispute, is, greater, than, twenty, dollars, however, the, seventh, amendment, right, to, a, civil, jury, trial, does, not, apply, in, state, courts, where, the, right, to, a, jury, is, strictly, a, matter, of, state, law, however, in, practice, all, states, except, louisiana, preserve, the, right, to, a, jury, trial, in, almost, all, civil, cases, where, the, sole, remedy, sought, is, money, damages, to, the, same, extent, as, jury, trials, are, permitted, by, the, seventh, amendment, under, the, law, of, many, states, jury, trials, are, not, allowed, in, small, claims, cases, the, civil, jury, in, the, united, states, is, a, defining, element, of, the, process, by, which, personal, injury, trials, are, handled, in, practice, even, though, the, defendant, in, a, criminal, action, is, entitled, to, a, trial, by, jury, most, criminal, actions, in, the, u, s, are, resolved, by, plea, bargain, only, about, 2, of, civil, cases, go, to, trial, with, only, about, half, of, those, trials, being, conducted, before, juries, in, 1898, the, supreme, court, held, that, the, jury, must, be, composed, of, at, least, twelve, persons, although, this, was, not, necessarily, extended, to, state, civil, jury, trials, in, 1970, however, the, supreme, court, held, that, the, twelve, person, requirement, was, a, historical, accident, and, upheld, six, person, juries, if, provided, for, under, state, law, in, both, criminal, and, civil, state, court, cases, there, is, controversy, over, smaller, juries, with, proponents, arguing, that, they, are, more, efficient, and, opponents, arguing, that, they, lead, to, fluctuating, verdicts, in, a, later, case, however, the, court, rejected, the, use, of, five, person, juries, in, criminal, cases, juries, go, through, a, selection, process, called, voir, dire, in, which, the, lawyers, question, the, jurors, and, then, make, challenges, for, cause, and, peremptory, challenges, to, remove, jurors, traditionally, the, removal, of, jurors, based, on, a, peremptory, challenge, required, no, justification, or, explanation, but, the, tradition, has, been, changed, by, the, supreme, court, where, the, reason, for, the, peremptory, challenge, was, the, race, of, the, potential, juror, since, the, 1970s, scientific, jury, selection, has, become, popular, unanimous, jury, verdicts, have, been, standard, in, us, american, law, this, requirement, was, upheld, by, the, supreme, court, in, 1897, but, the, standard, was, relaxed, in, 1972, in, two, criminal, cases, as, of, 1999, over, thirty, states, had, laws, allowing, less, than, unanimity, in, civil, cases, but, until, 2020, oregon, and, louisiana, were, the, only, states, which, have, laws, allowing, less, than, unanimous, jury, verdicts, for, criminal, cases, these, laws, were, overturned, in, ramos, v, louisiana, when, the, required, number, of, jurors, cannot, agree, on, a, verdict, a, situation, sometimes, referred, to, as, a, hung, jury, a, mistrial, is, declared, and, the, case, may, be, retried, with, a, newly, constituted, jury, the, practice, generally, was, that, the, jury, rules, only, on, questions, of, fact, and, guilt, setting, the, penalty, was, reserved, for, the, judge, this, practice, was, confirmed, by, rulings, of, the, u, s, supreme, court, such, as, in, ring, v, arizona, which, found, arizona, s, practice, of, having, the, judge, decide, whether, aggravating, factors, exist, to, make, a, defendant, eligible, for, the, death, penalty, to, be, unconstitutional, and, reserving, the, determination, of, whether, the, aggravating, factors, exist, to, be, decided, by, the, jury, however, in, some, states, such, as, alabama, and, florida, the, ultimate, decision, on, the, punishment, is, made, by, the, judge, and, the, jury, gives, only, a, non, binding, recommendation, the, judge, can, impose, the, death, penalty, even, if, the, jury, recommends, life, without, parole, there, is, no, set, format, for, jury, deliberations, and, the, jury, takes, a, period, of, time, to, settle, into, discussing, the, evidence, and, deciding, on, guilt, and, any, other, facts, the, judge, instructs, them, to, determine, deliberation, is, done, by, the, jury, only, with, none, of, the, lawyers, the, judge, or, the, defendant, present, the, first, step, will, typically, be, to, find, out, the, initial, feeling, or, reaction, of, the, jurors, to, the, case, which, may, be, by, a, show, of, hands, or, via, secret, ballot, the, jury, will, then, attempt, to, arrive, at, a, consensus, verdict, the, discussion, usually, helps, to, identify, jurors, views, to, see, whether, a, consensus, will, emerge, as, well, as, areas, that, bear, further, discussion, points, often, arise, that, were, not, specifically, discussed, during, the, trial, the, result, of, these, discussions, is, that, in, most, cases, the, jury, comes, to, a, unanimous, decision, and, a, verdict, is, thus, achieved, in, some, states, and, under, circumstances, the, decision, need, not, be, unanimous, in, a, few, states, and, in, death, penalty, cases, depending, upon, the, law, the, trial, jury, or, sometimes, a, separate, jury, may, determine, whether, the, death, penalty, is, appropriate, in, capital, murder, cases, usually, sentencing, is, handled, by, the, judge, at, a, separate, hearing, the, judge, may, but, does, not, always, follow, the, recommendations, of, the, jury, when, deciding, on, a, sentence, each, state, may, determine, the, extent, to, which, the, use, of, a, jury, is, used, the, use, of, a, jury, is, optional, for, civil, trials, in, any, australian, state, the, use, of, a, jury, in, criminal, trials, is, generally, by, a, unanimous, verdict, of, 12, lay, members, of, the, public, some, states, provide, exceptions, such, as, majority, 11, to, 1, or, 10, to, 2, verdicts, where, a, jury, cannot, otherwise, reach, a, verdict, all, states, except, victoria, allow, a, person, accused, of, a, criminal, offence, to, elect, to, be, tried, by, a, judge, alone, rather, than, the, default, jury, provision, the, constitution, of, australia, provides, in, section, 80, that, the, trial, on, indictment, of, any, offence, against, any, law, of, the, commonwealth, shall, be, by, jury, the, commonwealth, can, determine, which, offences, are, on, indictment, it, would, be, entirely, consistent, with, the, constitution, that, a, homicide, offence, could, be, tried, not, on, indictment, or, conversely, that, a, simple, assault, could, be, tried, on, indictment, this, interpretation, has, been, criticized, as, a, mockery, of, the, section, rendering, it, useless, where, a, trial, on, indictment, has, been, prescribed, it, is, an, essential, element, that, it, be, found, by, a, unanimous, verdict, of, guilty, by, 12, lay, members, of, the, public, this, requirement, stems, from, the, historical, meaning, of, jury, at, the, time, that, the, constitution, was, written, and, is, in, principle, thus, an, integral, element, of, trial, by, jury, unlike, in, the, australian, states, an, accused, person, cannot, elect, a, judge, only, trial, even, where, both, the, accused, and, the, prosecutor, seek, such, a, trial, in, november, 2023, indigenous, australian, law, expert, pattie,
