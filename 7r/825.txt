population, ageing, is, an, increasing, median, age, in, a, population, because, of, declining, fertility, rates, and, rising, life, expectancy, most, countries, have, rising, life, expectancy, and, an, ageing, population, trends, that, emerged, first, in, developed, countries, but, are, now, seen, in, virtually, all, developing, countries, in, most, developed, countries, the, phenomenon, of, population, aging, began, to, gradually, emerge, in, the, late, 19th, century, the, aging, of, the, world, population, occurred, in, the, late, 20th, century, with, the, proportion, of, people, aged, 65, and, above, accounting, for, 6, of, the, total, population, this, reflects, the, overall, decline, in, the, world, s, fertility, rate, at, that, time, that, is, the, case, for, every, country, in, the, world, except, the, 18, countries, designated, as, demographic, outliers, by, the, united, nations, the, aged, population, is, currently, at, its, highest, level, in, human, history, the, un, predicts, the, rate, of, population, ageing, in, the, 21st, century, will, exceed, that, of, the, previous, century, the, number, of, people, aged, 60, years, and, over, has, tripled, since, 1950, and, reached, 600, million, in, 2000, and, surpassed, 700, million, in, 2006, it, is, projected, that, the, combined, senior, and, geriatric, population, will, reach, 2, 1, billion, by, 2050, countries, vary, significantly, in, terms, of, the, degree, and, pace, of, ageing, and, the, un, expects, populations, that, began, ageing, later, will, have, less, time, to, adapt, to, its, implications, population, ageing, is, a, shift, in, the, distribution, of, a, country, s, population, towards, older, ages, and, is, usually, reflected, in, an, increase, in, the, population, s, mean, and, median, ages, a, decline, in, the, proportion, of, the, population, composed, of, children, and, a, rise, in, the, proportion, of, the, population, composed, of, the, elderly, population, ageing, is, widespread, across, the, world, and, is, most, advanced, in, the, most, highly, developed, countries, but, it, is, growing, faster, in, less, developed, regions, which, means, that, older, persons, will, be, increasingly, concentrated, in, the, less, developed, regions, of, the, world, the, oxford, institute, of, population, ageing, however, concluded, that, population, ageing, has, slowed, considerably, in, europe, and, will, have, the, greatest, future, impact, in, asia, especially, since, asia, is, in, stage, five, very, low, birth, rate, and, low, death, rate, of, the, demographic, transition, model, among, the, countries, currently, classified, by, the, united, nations, as, more, developed, with, a, total, population, of, 1, 2, billion, in, 2005, the, overall, median, age, rose, from, 28, in, 1950, to, 40, in, 2010, and, is, forecast, to, rise, to, 44, by, 2050, the, corresponding, figures, for, the, world, as, a, whole, are, 24, in, 1950, 29, in, 2010, and, 36, in, 2050, for, the, less, developed, regions, the, median, age, will, go, from, 26, in, 2010, to, 35, in, 2050, population, ageing, arises, from, two, possibly, related, demographic, effects, increasing, longevity, and, declining, fertility, an, increase, in, longevity, raises, the, average, age, of, the, population, by, increasing, the, numbers, of, surviving, older, people, a, decline, in, fertility, reduces, the, number, of, babies, and, as, the, effect, continues, the, numbers, of, younger, people, in, general, also, reduce, of, the, two, forces, declining, fertility, now, contributes, to, most, of, the, population, ageing, in, the, world, more, specifically, the, large, decline, in, the, overall, fertility, rate, over, the, last, half, century, is, primarily, responsible, for, the, population, ageing, in, the, world, s, most, developed, countries, because, many, developing, countries, are, going, through, faster, fertility, transitions, they, will, experience, even, faster, population, ageing, than, the, currently, developed, countries, will, the, rate, at, which, the, population, ages, is, likely, to, increase, over, the, next, three, decades, however, few, countries, know, whether, their, older, population, are, living, the, extra, years, of, life, in, good, or, poor, health, a, compression, of, morbidity, would, imply, reduced, disability, in, old, age, but, an, expansion, would, see, an, increase, in, poor, health, with, increased, longevity, another, option, has, been, posed, for, a, situation, of, dynamic, equilibrium, that, is, crucial, information, for, governments, if, the, limits, of, lifespan, continue, to, increase, indefinitely, as, some, researchers, believe, the, world, health, organization, s, suite, of, household, health, studies, is, working, to, provide, the, needed, health, and, well, being, evidence, such, as, the, world, health, survey, and, the, study, on, global, ageing, and, adult, health, sage, the, surveys, cover, 308, 000, respondents, aged, at, least, 18, and, 81, 000, aged, at, least, 50, from, 70, countries, the, global, ageing, survey, exploring, attitudes, expectations, and, behaviours, towards, later, life, and, retirement, directed, by, george, leeson, and, covering, 44, 000, people, aged, 40, 80, in, 24, countries, from, across, the, globe, has, revealed, that, many, people, are, now, fully, aware, of, the, ageing, of, the, world, s, population, and, the, implications, that, it, will, have, on, their, lives, and, those, of, their, children, and, grandchildren, canada, has, the, highest, per, capita, immigration, rate, in, the, world, partly, to, counter, population, ageing, the, c, d, howe, institute, a, conservative, think, tank, has, suggested, that, immigration, cannot, be, used, as, a, viable, means, to, counter, population, ageing, that, conclusion, is, also, seen, in, the, work, of, other, scholars, the, demographers, peter, mcdonald, and, rebecca, kippen, commented, as, fertility, sinks, further, below, replacement, level, increasingly, higher, levels, of, annual, net, migration, will, be, required, to, maintain, a, target, of, even, zero, population, growth, the, world, s, older, population, is, growing, dramatically, the, more, developed, countries, also, have, older, populations, as, their, citizens, live, longer, less, developed, countries, have, much, younger, populations, an, interactive, version, of, the, map, is, available, here, asia, and, africa, are, the, two, regions, with, a, significant, number, of, countries, facing, population, ageing, within, 20, years, many, countries, in, those, regions, will, face, a, situation, of, the, largest, population, cohort, being, those, over, 65, and, the, average, age, approaching, 50, in, 2100, according, to, research, led, by, the, university, of, washington, 2, 4, billion, people, will, be, over, the, age, of, 65, compared, with, 1, 7, billion, under, the, age, of, 20, the, oxford, institute, of, population, ageing, is, an, institution, looking, at, global, population, ageing, its, research, reveals, that, many, of, the, views, of, global, ageing, are, based, on, myths, and, that, there, will, be, considerable, opportunities, for, the, world, as, its, population, matures, as, the, institute, s, director, professor, sarah, harper, highlighted, in, her, book, ageing, societies, most, of, the, developed, countries, now, have, sub, replacement, fertility, levels, and, population, growth, now, depends, largely, on, immigration, together, with, population, momentum, which, also, arises, from, previous, large, generations, now, enjoying, longer, life, expectancy, of, the, roughly, 150, 000, people, who, die, each, day, across, the, globe, about, two, thirds, 100, 000, per, day, die, of, age, related, causes, in, industrialised, nations, that, proportion, is, much, higher, and, reaches, 90, the, economic, effects, of, an, ageing, population, are, considerable, nowadays, more, and, more, people, are, paying, attention, to, the, economic, issues, and, social, policy, challenges, related, to, the, elderly, population, older, people, have, higher, accumulated, savings, per, head, than, younger, people, but, spend, less, on, consumer, goods, depending, on, the, age, ranges, at, which, the, changes, occur, an, ageing, population, may, thus, result, in, lower, interest, rates, and, the, economic, benefits, of, lower, inflation, some, economists, in, japan, see, advantages, in, such, changes, notably, the, opportunity, to, progress, automation, and, technological, development, without, causing, unemployment, and, emphasise, a, shift, from, gdp, to, personal, well, being, however, population, ageing, also, increases, some, categories, of, expenditure, including, some, met, from, public, finances, the, largest, area, of, expenditure, in, many, countries, is, now, health, care, whose, cost, is, likely, to, increase, dramatically, as, populations, age, this, would, present, governments, with, hard, choices, between, higher, taxes, including, a, possible, reweighing, of, tax, from, earnings, to, consumption, and, a, reduced, government, role, in, providing, health, care, the, working, population, will, face, greater, pressure, and, a, portion, of, their, taxes, will, have, to, be, used, to, pay, for, healthcare, and, pensions, for, the, elderly, however, recent, studies, in, some, countries, demonstrate, the, dramatic, rising, costs, of, health, care, are, more, attributable, to, rising, drug, and, doctor, costs, and, the, higher, use, of, diagnostic, testing, by, all, age, groups, not, to, the, ageing, population, that, is, often, claimed, the, second, largest, expenditure, of, most, governments, is, education, with, expenses, that, tend, to, fall, with, an, ageing, population, especially, as, fewer, young, people, would, probably, continue, into, tertiary, education, as, they, would, be, in, demand, as, part, of, the, work, force, social, security, systems, have, also, begun, to, experience, problems, earlier, defined, benefit, pension, systems, are, experiencing, sustainability, problems, because, of, the, increased, longevity, the, extension, of, the, pension, period, was, not, paired, with, an, extension, of, the, active, labour, period, or, a, rise, in, pension, contributions, which, has, resulted, in, a, decline, of, replacement, ratios, population, ageing, also, affects, workforce, in, many, countries, the, increase, in, the, number, of, elderly, people, means, the, weakening, or, disappearance, of, the, demographic, dividend, and, social, resources, have, to, flow, more, towards, elderly, people, in, need, of, support, the, demographic, dividend, refers, to, the, beneficial, impact, of, a, decline, in, fertility, rate, on, a, country, s, population, age, structure, and, economic, growth, the, older, workers, would, spend, more, time, on, work, and, human, capital, of, an, ageing, workforce, is, low, reducing, labor, productivity, the, expectation, of, continuing, population, ageing, prompts, questions, about, welfare, states, capacity, to, meet, the, needs, of, the, population, in, the, early, 2000s, the, world, health, organization, set, up, guidelines, to, encourage, active, ageing, and, to, help, local, governments, address, the, challenges, of, an, ageing, population, global, age, friendly, cities, with, regard, to, urbanization, housing, transportation, social, participation, health, services, etc, local, governments, are, well, positioned, to, meet, the, needs, of, local, smaller, populations, but, as, their, resources, vary, from, one, to, another, e, g, property, taxes, the, existence, of, community, organizations, the, greater, responsibility, on, local, governments, is, likely, to, increase, inequalities, in, canada, the, most, fortunate, and, healthier, elders, tend, to, live, in, more, prosperous, cities, offering, a, wide, range, of, services, but, the, less, fortunate, lack, access, to, the, same, level, of, resources, private, residences, for, the, elderly, also, provide, many, services, related, to, health, and, social, participation, e, g, pharmacy, group, activities, and, events, on, site, but, they, are, not, accessible, to, the, less, fortunate, also, the, environmental, gerontology, indicates, the, importance, of, the, environment, in, active, ageing, in, fact, promoting, good, environments, natural, built, social, in, ageing, can, improve, health, and, quality, of, life, and, reduce, the, problems, of, disability, and, dependence, and, in, general, social, spending, and, health, spending, an, ageing, population, may, provide, incentive, for, technological, progress, as, some, hypothesise, the, effect, of, a, shrinking, workforce, may, be, offset, by, automation, and, productivity, gains, meanwhile, improving, the, productivity, of, the, elderly, has, also, become, a, method, to, alleviate, the, problem, of, social, aging, but, this, first, requires, increasing, their, investment, in, education, and, providing, suitable, job, opportunities, is, equally, important, generally, in, west, africa, and, specifically, in, ghana, social, policy, implications, of, demographic, ageing, are, multidimensional, such, as, rural, urban, distribution, gender, composition, levels, of, literacy, illiteracy, as, well, as, their, occupational, histories, and, income, security, current, policies, on, ageing, in, ghana, seem, to, be, disjointed, and, ideas, on, documents, on, to, improve, policies, in, population, ageing, have, yet, to, be, concretely, implemented, perhaps, partly, because, of, many, arguments, that, older, people, are, only, a, small, proportion, of, the, population, global, ageing, populations, seem, to, cause, many, countries, to, be, increasing, the, age, for, old, age, security, from, 60, to, 65, to, decrease, the, cost, of, the, scheme, of, the, gdp, however, even, so, in, industrialized, countries, with, the, greatest, improvement, in, life, expectancy, discussions, about, continuing, to, raise, the, eligibility, age, for, pension, benefits, have, intensified, in, order, to, reduce, economic, burden, more, significantly, age, discrimination, can, be, defined, as, the, systematic, and, institutionalized, denial, of, the, rights, of, older, people, on, the, basis, of, their, age, by, individuals, groups, organisations, and, institutions, some, of, the, abuse, can, be, a, result, of, ignorance, thoughtlessness, prejudice, and, stereotyping, forms, of, discrimination, are, economic, accessibility, social, accessibility, temporal, accessibility, and, administrative, accessibility, in, most, countries, worldwide, particularly, countries, in, africa, older, people, are, typically, the, poorest, members, of, the, social, spectrum, and, live, below, the, poverty, line, moreover, the, growing, burden, of, health, expenditure, has, evolved, into, a, social, policy, and, cost, management, issue, not, just, a, population, issue
