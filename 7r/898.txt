anti, aircraft, warfare, is, the, counter, to, aerial, warfare, and, it, includes, all, measures, designed, to, nullify, or, reduce, the, effectiveness, of, hostile, air, action, it, includes, surface, based, subsurface, submarine, launched, and, air, based, weapon, systems, associated, sensor, systems, command, and, control, arrangements, and, passive, measures, e, g, barrage, balloons, it, may, be, used, to, protect, naval, ground, and, air, forces, in, any, location, however, for, most, countries, the, main, effort, has, tended, to, be, homeland, defence, missile, defence, is, an, extension, of, air, defence, as, are, initiatives, to, adapt, air, defence, to, the, task, of, intercepting, any, projectile, in, flight, most, modern, anti, aircraft, aa, weapons, systems, are, optimized, for, short, medium, or, long, range, air, defence, although, some, systems, may, incorporate, multiple, weapons, such, as, both, autocannons, and, surface, to, air, missiles, layered, air, defence, usually, refers, to, multiple, tiers, of, air, defence, systems, which, when, combined, an, airborne, threat, must, penetrate, in, order, to, reach, its, target, this, defence, is, usually, accomplished, via, the, combined, use, of, systems, optimized, for, either, short, medium, or, long, range, air, defence, in, some, countries, such, as, britain, and, germany, during, the, second, world, war, the, soviet, union, and, modern, nato, and, the, united, states, ground, based, air, defence, and, air, defence, aircraft, have, been, under, integrated, command, and, control, however, while, overall, air, defence, may, be, for, homeland, defence, including, military, facilities, forces, in, the, field, wherever, they, are, provide, their, own, defences, against, airborne, threats, until, the, 1950s, guns, firing, ballistic, munitions, ranging, from, 7, 62, mm, 30, in, to, 152, 4, mm, 6, in, were, the, standard, weapons, guided, missiles, then, became, dominant, except, at, the, very, shortest, ranges, as, with, close, in, weapon, systems, which, typically, use, rotary, autocannons, or, in, very, modern, systems, surface, to, air, adaptations, of, short, range, air, to, air, missiles, often, combined, in, one, system, with, rotary, cannons, it, may, also, be, called, counter, air, anti, air, aa, flak, layered, air, defence, or, air, defence, forces, the, term, air, defence, was, probably, first, used, by, the, uk, when, air, defence, of, great, britain, adgb, was, created, as, a, royal, air, force, command, in, 1925, however, arrangements, in, the, uk, were, also, called, anti, aircraft, abbreviated, as, aa, a, term, that, remained, in, general, use, into, the, 1950s, after, the, first, world, war, it, was, sometimes, prefixed, by, light, or, heavy, laa, or, haa, to, classify, a, type, of, gun, or, unit, nicknames, for, anti, aircraft, guns, include, aa, aaa, or, triple, a, abbreviations, of, anti, aircraft, artillery, flak, from, the, german, flugzeugabwehrkanone, ack, ack, from, the, spelling, alphabet, used, by, the, british, for, voice, transmission, of, aa, and, archie, a, world, war, i, british, term, probably, coined, by, amyas, borton, and, believed, to, derive, via, the, royal, flying, corps, from, the, music, hall, comedian, george, robey, s, line, archibald, certainly, not, nato, defines, anti, aircraft, warfare, aaw, as, measures, taken, to, defend, a, maritime, force, against, attacks, by, airborne, weapons, launched, from, aircraft, ships, submarines, and, land, based, sites, in, some, armies, the, term, all, arms, air, defence, aaad, is, used, for, air, defence, by, nonspecialist, troops, other, terms, from, the, late, 20th, century, include, ground, based, air, defence, gbad, with, related, terms, short, range, air, defense, shorad, and, man, portable, air, defense, system, manpads, anti, aircraft, missiles, are, variously, called, surface, to, air, missiles, sams, and, surface, to, air, guided, weapons, sagws, examples, are, the, rim, 66, standard, raytheon, standard, missile, 6, or, the, mbda, aster, missile, non, english, terms, for, air, defence, include, the, german, flak, or, flak, fliegerabwehrkanone, aircraft, defence, cannon, also, cited, as, flugabwehrkanone, whence, english, flak, and, the, russian, term, protivovozdushnaya, oborona, cyrillic, a, literal, translation, of, anti, air, defence, abbreviated, as, pvo, in, russian, the, aa, systems, are, called, zenitnye, i, e, pointing, to, zenith, systems, in, french, air, defence, is, called, d, fense, contre, les, a, ronefs, dca, a, ronef, meaning, aircraft, the, maximum, distance, at, which, a, gun, or, missile, can, engage, an, aircraft, is, an, important, figure, however, many, different, definitions, are, used, and, unless, the, same, definition, is, used, performance, of, different, guns, or, missiles, cannot, be, compared, for, aa, guns, only, the, ascending, part, of, the, trajectory, can, be, usefully, used, one, term, is, ceiling, the, maximum, ceiling, being, the, height, a, projectile, would, reach, if, fired, vertically, not, practically, useful, in, itself, as, few, aa, guns, are, able, to, fire, vertically, and, the, maximum, fuse, duration, may, be, too, short, but, potentially, useful, as, a, standard, to, compare, different, weapons, the, british, adopted, effective, ceiling, meaning, the, altitude, at, which, a, gun, could, deliver, a, series, of, shells, against, a, moving, target, this, could, be, constrained, by, maximum, fuse, running, time, as, well, as, the, gun, s, capability, by, the, late, 1930s, the, british, definition, was, that, height, at, which, a, directly, approaching, target, at, 400, mph, can, be, engaged, for, 20, seconds, before, the, gun, reaches, 70, degrees, elevation, the, essence, of, air, defence, is, to, detect, hostile, aircraft, and, destroy, them, the, critical, issue, is, to, hit, a, target, moving, in, three, dimensional, space, an, attack, must, not, only, match, these, three, coordinates, but, must, do, so, at, the, time, the, target, is, at, that, position, this, means, that, projectiles, either, have, to, be, guided, to, hit, the, target, or, aimed, at, the, predicted, position, of, the, target, at, the, time, the, projectile, reaches, it, taking, into, account, the, speed, and, direction, of, both, the, target, and, the, projectile, throughout, the, 20th, century, air, defence, was, one, of, the, fastest, evolving, areas, of, military, technology, responding, to, the, evolution, of, aircraft, and, exploiting, technology, such, as, radar, guided, missiles, and, computing, initially, electromechanical, analogue, computing, from, the, 1930s, on, as, with, equipment, described, below, improvements, were, made, to, sensors, technical, fire, control, weapons, and, command, and, control, at, the, start, of, the, 20th, century, these, were, either, very, primitive, or, non, existent, initially, sensors, were, optical, and, acoustic, devices, developed, during, world, war, i, and, continued, into, the, 1930s, but, were, quickly, superseded, by, radar, which, in, turn, was, supplemented, by, optoelectronics, in, the, 1980s, command, and, control, remained, primitive, until, the, late, 1930s, when, britain, created, an, integrated, system, for, adgb, that, linked, the, ground, based, air, defence, of, the, british, army, s, anti, aircraft, command, although, field, deployed, air, defence, relied, on, less, sophisticated, arrangements, nato, later, called, these, arrangements, an, air, defence, ground, environment, defined, as, the, network, of, ground, radar, sites, and, command, and, control, centres, within, a, specific, theatre, of, operations, which, are, used, for, the, tactical, control, of, air, defence, operations, rules, of, engagement, are, critical, to, prevent, air, defences, engaging, friendly, or, neutral, aircraft, their, use, is, assisted, but, not, governed, by, identification, friend, or, foe, iff, electronic, devices, originally, introduced, during, the, second, world, war, while, these, rules, originate, at, the, highest, authority, different, rules, can, apply, to, different, types, of, air, defence, covering, the, same, area, at, the, same, time, aaad, usually, operates, under, the, tightest, rules, nato, calls, these, rules, weapon, control, orders, wco, they, are, until, the, 1950s, guns, firing, ballistic, munitions, were, the, standard, weapon, guided, missiles, then, became, dominant, except, at, the, very, shortest, ranges, however, the, type, of, shell, or, warhead, and, its, fuzing, and, with, missiles, the, guidance, arrangement, were, and, are, varied, targets, are, not, always, easy, to, destroy, nonetheless, damaged, aircraft, may, be, forced, to, abort, their, mission, and, even, if, they, manage, to, return, and, land, in, friendly, territory, may, be, out, of, action, for, days, or, permanently, ignoring, small, arms, and, smaller, machine, guns, ground, based, air, defence, guns, have, varied, in, calibre, from, 20, mm, to, at, least, 152, mm, ground, based, air, defence, is, deployed, in, several, ways, air, defence, has, included, other, elements, although, after, the, second, world, war, most, fell, into, disuse, passive, air, defence, is, defined, by, nato, as, passive, measures, taken, for, the, physical, defence, and, protection, of, personnel, essential, installations, and, equipment, in, order, to, minimise, the, effectiveness, of, air, and, or, missile, attack, it, remains, a, vital, activity, by, ground, forces, and, includes, camouflage, and, concealment, to, avoid, detection, by, reconnaissance, and, attacking, aircraft, measures, such, as, camouflaging, important, buildings, were, common, in, the, second, world, war, during, the, cold, war, the, runways, and, taxiways, of, some, airfields, were, painted, green, while, navies, are, usually, responsible, for, their, own, air, defence, at, least, for, ships, at, sea, organisational, arrangements, for, land, based, air, defence, vary, between, nations, and, over, time, the, most, extreme, case, was, the, soviet, union, and, this, model, may, still, be, followed, in, some, countries, it, was, a, separate, service, on, a, par, with, the, army, navy, or, air, force, in, the, soviet, union, this, was, called, voyska, pvo, and, had, both, fighter, aircraft, separate, from, the, air, force, and, ground, based, systems, this, was, divided, into, two, arms, pvo, strany, the, strategic, air, defence, service, responsible, for, air, defence, of, the, homeland, created, in, 1941, and, becoming, an, independent, service, in, 1954, and, pvo, sv, air, defence, of, the, ground, forces, subsequently, these, became, part, of, the, air, force, and, ground, forces, respectively, at, the, other, extreme, the, united, states, army, has, an, air, defense, artillery, branch, that, provides, ground, based, air, defence, for, both, homeland, and, the, army, in, the, field, however, it, is, operationally, under, the, joint, force, air, component, commander, many, other, nations, also, deploy, an, air, defence, branch, in, the, army, some, such, as, japan, or, israel, choose, to, integrate, their, ground, based, air, defence, systems, into, their, air, force, in, britain, and, some, other, armies, the, single, artillery, branch, has, been, responsible, for, both, home, and, overseas, ground, based, air, defence, although, there, was, divided, responsibility, with, the, royal, navy, for, air, defence, of, the, british, isles, in, world, war, i, however, during, the, second, world, war, the, raf, regiment, was, formed, to, protect, airfields, everywhere, and, this, included, light, air, defences, in, the, later, decades, of, the, cold, war, this, included, the, united, states, air, force, s, operating, bases, in, the, uk, all, ground, based, air, defence, was, removed, from, royal, air, force, raf, jurisdiction, in, 2004, the, british, army, s, anti, aircraft, command, was, disbanded, in, march, 1955, but, during, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, the, raf, s, fighter, command, operated, long, range, air, defence, missiles, to, protect, key, areas, in, the, uk, during, world, war, ii, the, royal, marines, also, provided, air, defence, units, formally, part, of, the, mobile, naval, base, defence, organisation, they, were, handled, as, an, integral, part, of, the, army, commanded, ground, based, air, defences, the, basic, air, defence, unit, is, typically, a, battery, with, 2, to, 12, guns, or, missile, launchers, and, fire, control, elements, these, batteries, particularly, with, guns, usually, deploy, in, a, small, area, although, batteries, may, be, split, this, is, usual, for, some, missile, systems, shorad, missile, batteries, often, deploy, across, an, area, with, individual, launchers, several, kilometres, apart, when, manpads, is, operated, by, specialists, batteries, may, have, several, dozen, teams, deploying, separately, in, small, sections, self, propelled, air, defence, guns, may, deploy, in, pairs, batteries, are, usually, grouped, into, battalions, or, equivalent, in, the, field, army, a, light, gun, or, shorad, battalion, is, often, assigned, to, a, manoeuvre, division, heavier, guns, and, long, range, missiles, may, be, in, air, defence, brigades, and, come, under, corps, or, higher, command, homeland, air, defence, may, have, a, full, military, structure, for, example, the, uk, s, anti, aircraft, command, commanded, by, a, full, british, army, general, was, part, of, adgb, at, its, peak, in, 1941, 42, it, comprised, three, aa, corps, with, 12, aa, divisions, between, them, the, use, of, balloons, by, the, u, s, army, during, the, american, civil, war, compelled, the, confederates, to, develop, methods, of, combating, them, these, included, the, use, of, artillery, small, arms, and, saboteurs, they, were, unsuccessful, and, internal, politics, led, the, united, states, army, s, balloon, corps, to, be, disbanded, mid, war, the, confederates, experimented, with, balloons, as, well, turks, carried, out, the, first, ever, anti, airplane, operation, in, history, during, the, italo, turkish, war, although, lacking, anti, aircraft, weapons, they, were, the, first, to, shoot, down, an, airplane, by, rifle, fire, the, first, aircraft, to, crash, in, a, war, was, the, one, of, lieutenant, piero, manzini, shot, down, on, august, 25, 1912, the, earliest, known, use, of, weapons, specifically, made, for, the, anti, aircraft, role, occurred, during, the, franco, prussian, war, of, 1870, after, the, disaster, at, sedan, paris, was, besieged, and, french, troops, outside, the, city, started, an, attempt, at, communication, via, balloon, gustav, krupp, mounted, a, modified, 1, pounder, 37, mm, gun, the, ballonabwehrkanone, balloon, defence, cannon, or, bak, on, top, of, a, horse, drawn, carriage, for, the, purpose, of, shooting, down, these, balloons, by, the, early, 20th, century, balloon, or, airship, guns, for, land, and, naval, use, were, attracting, attention, various, types, of, ammunition, were, proposed, high, explosive, incendiary, bullet, chains, rod, bullets, and, shrapnel, the, need, for, some, form, of, tracer, or, smoke, trail, was, articulated, fuzing, options, were, also, examined, both, impact, and, time, types, mountings, were, generally, pedestal, type, but, could, be, on, field, platforms, trials, were, underway, in, most, countries, in, europe, but, only, krupp, erhardt, vickers, maxim, and, schneider, had, published, any, information, by, 1910, krupp, s, designs, included, adaptations, of, their, 65, mm, 9, pounder, a, 75, mm, 12, pounder, and, even, a, 105, mm, gun, erhardt, also, had, a, 12, pounder, while, vickers, maxim, offered, a, 3, pounder, and, schneider, a, 47, mm, the, french, balloon, gun, appeared, in, 1910, it, was, an, 11, pounder, but, mounted, on, a, vehicle, with, a, total, uncrewed, weight, of, two, tons, however, since, balloons, were, slow, moving, sights, were, simple, but, the, challenges, of, faster, moving, aeroplanes, were, recognised, by, 1913, only, france, and, germany, had, developed, field, guns, suitable, for, engaging, balloons, and, aircraft, and, addressed, issues, of, military, organisation, britain, s, royal, navy, would, soon, introduce, the, qf, 3, inch, and, qf, 4, inch, aa, guns, and, also, had, vickers, 1, pounder, quick, firing, pom, poms, that, could, be, used, in, various, mountings, the, first, us, anti, aircraft, cannon, was, a, 1, pounder, concept, design, by, admiral, twining, in, 1911, to, meet, the, perceived, threat, of, airships, that, eventually, was, used, as, the, basis, for, the, us, navy, s, first, operational, anti, aircraft, cannon, the, 3, inch, 23, caliber, gun, on, the, 30th, of, september, 1915, troops, of, the, serbian, army, observed, three, enemy, aircraft, approaching, kragujevac, soldiers, fired, at, them, with, shotguns, and, machine, guns, but, failed, to, prevent, them, from, dropping, 45, bombs, over, the, city, hitting, military, installations, the, railway, station, and, many, other, mostly, civilian, targets, in, the, city, during, the, bombing, raid, private, radoje, ljutovac, fired, his, cannon, at, the, enemy, aircraft, and, successfully, shot, one, down, it, crashed, in, the, city, and, both, pilots, died, from, their, injuries, the, cannon, ljutovac, used, was, not, designed, as, an, anti, aircraft, gun, it, was, a, slightly, modified, turkish, cannon, captured, during, the, first, balkan, war, in, 1912, this, was, the, first, occasion, in, military, history, that, a, military, aircraft, was, shot, down, with, ground, to, air, artillery, fire, the, british, recognised, the, need, for, anti, aircraft, capability, a, few, weeks, before, world, war, i, broke, out, on, 8, july, 1914, the, new, york, times, reported, that, the, british, government, had, decided, to, dot, the, coasts, of, the, british, isles, with, a, series, of, towers, each, armed, with, two, quick, firing, guns, of, special, design, while, a, complete, circle, of, towers, was, to, be, built, around, naval, installations, and, at, other, especially, vulnerable, points, by, december, 1914, the, royal, naval, volunteer, reserve, rnvr, was, manning, aa, guns, and, searchlights, assembled, from, various, sources, at, some, nine, ports, the, royal, garrison, artillery, rga, was, given, responsibility, for, aa, defence, in, the, field, using, motorised, two, gun, sections, the, first, were, formally, formed, in, november, 1914, initially, they, used, qf, 1, pounder, pom, pom, s, 37, mm, versions, of, the, maxim, gun, all, armies, soon, deployed, aa, guns, often, based, on, their, smaller, field, pieces, notably, the, french, 75, mm, and, russian, 76, 2, mm, typically, simply, propped, up, on, some, sort, of, embankment, to, get, the, muzzle, pointed, skyward, the, british, army, adopted, the, 13, pounder, quickly, producing, new, mountings, suitable, for, aa, use, the, 13, pdr, qf, 6, cwt, mk, iii, was, issued, in, 1915, it, remained, in, service, throughout, the, war, but, 18, pdr, guns, were, lined, down, to, take, the, 13, pdr, shell, with, a, larger, cartridge, producing, the, 13, pr, qf, 9, cwt, and, these, proved, much, more, satisfactory, however, in, general, these, ad, hoc, solutions, proved, largely, useless, with, little, experience, in, the, role, no, means, of, measuring, target, range, height, or, speed, the, difficulty, of, observing, their, shell, bursts, relative, to, the, target, gunners, proved, unable, to, get, their, fuse, setting, correct, and, most, rounds, burst, well, below, their, targets, the, exception, to, this, rule, was, the, guns, protecting, spotting, balloons, in, which, case, the, altitude, could, be, accurately, measured, from, the, length, of, the, cable, holding, the, balloon, the, first, issue, was, ammunition, before, the, war, it, was, recognised, that, ammunition, needed, to, explode, in, the, air, both, high, explosive, he, and, shrapnel, were, used, mostly, the, former, airburst, fuses, were, either, igniferious, based, on, a, burning, fuse, or, mechanical, clockwork, igniferious, fuses, were, not, well, suited, for, anti, aircraft, use, the, fuse, length, was, determined, by, time, of, flight, but, the, burning, rate, of, the, gunpowder, was, affected, by, altitude, the, british, pom, poms, had, only, contact, fused, ammunition, zeppelins, being, hydrogen, filled, balloons, were, targets, for, incendiary, shells, and, the, british, introduced, these, with, airburst, fuses, both, shrapnel, type, forward, projection, of, incendiary, pot, and, base, ejection, of, an, incendiary, stream, the, british, also, fitted, tracers, to, their, shells, for, use, at, night, smoke, shells, were, also, available, for, some, aa, guns, these, bursts, were, used, as, targets, during, training, german, air, attacks, on, the, british, isles, increased, in, 1915, and, the, aa, efforts, were, deemed, somewhat, ineffective, so, a, royal, navy, gunnery, expert, admiral, sir, percy, scott, was, appointed, to, make, improvements, particularly, an, integrated, aa, defence, for, london, the, air, defences, were, expanded, with, more, rnvr, aa, guns, 75, mm, and, 3, inch, the, pom, poms, being, ineffective, the, naval, 3, inch, was, also, adopted, by, the, army, the, qf, 3, inch, 20, cwt, 76, mm, a, new, field, mounting, was, introduced, in, 1916, since, most, attacks, were, at, night, searchlights, were, soon, used, and, acoustic, methods, of, detection, and, locating, were, developed, by, december, 1916, there, were, 183, aa, sections, defending, britain, most, with, the, 3, inch, 74, with, the, bef, in, france, and, 10, in, the, middle, east, aa, gunnery, was, a, difficult, business, the, problem, was, of, successfully, aiming, a, shell, to, burst, close, to, its, target, s, future, position, with, various, factors, affecting, the, shells, predicted, trajectory, this, was, called, deflection, gun, laying, where, off, set, angles, for, range, and, elevation, were, set, on, the, gunsight, and, updated, as, their, target, moved, in, this, method, when, the, sights, were, on, the, target, the, barrel, was, pointed, at, the, target, s, future, position, range, and, height, of, the, target, determined, fuse, length, the, difficulties, increased, as, aircraft, performance, improved, the, british, dealt, with, range, measurement, first, when, it, was, realised, that, range, was, the, key, to, producing, a, better, fuse, setting, this, led, to, the, height, range, finder, hrf, the, first, model, being, the, barr, stroud, ub2, a, two, metre, optical, coincident, rangefinder, mounted, on, a, tripod, it, measured, the, distance, to, the, target, and, the, elevation, angle, which, together, gave, the, height, of, the, aircraft, these, were, complex, instruments, and, various, other, methods, were, also, used, the, hrf, was, soon, joined, by, the, height, fuse, indicator, hfi, this, was, marked, with, elevation, angles, and, height, lines, overlaid, with, fuse, length, curves, using, the, height, reported, by, the, hrf, operator, the, necessary, fuse, length, could, be, read, off, however, the, problem, of, deflection, settings, aim, off, required, knowing, the, rate, of, change, in, the, target, s, position, both, france, and, the, uk, introduced, tachymetric, devices, to, track, targets, and, produce, vertical, and, horizontal, deflection, angles, the, french, brocq, system, was, electrical, the, operator, entered, the, target, range, and, had, displays, at, guns, it, was, used, with, their, 75, mm, the, british, wilson, dalby, gun, director, used, a, pair, of, trackers, and, mechanical, tachymetry, the, operator, entered, the, fuse, length, and, deflection, angles, were, read, from, the, instruments, by, the, start, of, world, war, i, the, 77, mm, had, become, the, standard, german, weapon, and, came, mounted, on, a, large, traverse, that, could, be, easily, transported, on, a, wagon, krupp, 75, mm, guns, were, supplied, with, an, optical, sighting, system, that, improved, their, capabilities, the, german, army, also, adapted, a, revolving, cannon, that, came, to, be, known, to, allied, fliers, as, the, flaming, onion, from, the, shells, in, flight, this, gun, had, five, barrels, that, quickly, launched, a, series, of, 37, mm, artillery, shells, as, aircraft, started, to, be, used, against, ground, targets, on, the, battlefield, the, aa, guns, could, not, be, traversed, quickly, enough, at, close, targets, and, being, relatively, few, were, not, always, in, the, right, place, and, were, often, unpopular, with, other, troops, so, changed, positions, frequently, soon, the, forces, were, adding, various, machine, gun, based, weapons, mounted, on, poles, these, short, range, weapons, proved, more, deadly, and, the, red, baron, is, believed, to, have, been, shot, down, by, an, anti, aircraft, vickers, machine, gun, when, the, war, ended, it, was, clear, that, the, increasing, capabilities, of, aircraft, would, require, better, means, of, acquiring, targets, and, aiming, at, them, nevertheless, a, pattern, had, been, set, anti, aircraft, warfare, would, employ, heavy, weapons, to, attack, high, altitude, targets, and, lighter, weapons, for, use, when, aircraft, came, to, lower, altitudes, world, war, i, demonstrated, that, aircraft, could, be, an, important, part, of, the, battlefield, but, in, some, nations, it, was, the, prospect, of, strategic, air, attack, that, was, the, main, issue, presenting, both, a, threat, and, an, opportunity, the, experience, of, four, years, of, air, attacks, on, london, by, zeppelins, and, gotha, g, v, bombers, had, particularly, influenced, the, british, and, was, one, of, if, not, the, main, driver, for, forming, an, independent, air, force, as, the, capabilities, of, aircraft, and, their, engines, improved, it, was, clear, that, their, role, in, future, war, would, be, even, more, critical, as, their, range, and, weapon, load, grew, however, in, the, years, immediately, after, world, war, i, the, prospect, of, another, major, war, seemed, remote, particularly, in, europe, where, the, most, militarily, capable, nations, were, and, little, financing, was, available, four, years, of, war, had, seen, the, creation, of, a, new, and, technically, demanding, branch, of, military, activity, air, defence, had, made, huge, advances, albeit, from, a, very, low, starting, point, however, it, was, new, and, often, lacked, influential, friends, in, the, competition, for, a, share, of, limited, defence, budgets, demobilisation, meant, that, most, aa, guns, were, taken, out, of, service, leaving, only, the, most, modern, however, there, were, lessons, to, be, learned, in, particular, the, british, who, had, had, aa, guns, in, most, theatres, in, action, in, daylight, and, used, them, against, night, attacks, at, home, furthermore, they, had, also, formed, an, anti, aircraft, experimental, section, during, the, war, and, accumulated, large, amounts, of, data, that, was, subjected, to, extensive, analysis, as, a, result, they, published, the, two, volume, textbook, of, anti, aircraft, gunnery, in, 1924, 1925, it, included, five, key, recommendations, for, haa, equipment, two, assumptions, underpinned, the, british, approach, to, haa, fire, first, aimed, fire, was, the, primary, method, and, this, was, enabled, by, predicting, gun, data, from, visually, tracking, the, target, and, having, its, height, second, that, the, target, would, maintain, a, steady, course, speed, and, height, this, haa, was, to, engage, targets, up, to, 24, 000, ft, 7, 3, km, mechanical, time, fuses, were, required, because, the, speed, of, powder, burning, varied, with, height, so, fuse, length, was, not, a, simple, function, of, time, of, flight, automated, fire, ensured, a, constant, rate, of, fire, that, made, it, easier, to, predict, where, each, shell, should, be, individually, aimed, in, 1925, the, british, adopted, a, new, instrument, developed, by, vickers, it, was, a, mechanical, analogue, computer, the, predictor, aa, no, 1, given, the, target, height, its, operators, tracked, the, target, and, the, predictor, produced, bearing, quadrant, elevation, and, fuse, setting, these, were, passed, electrically, to, the, guns, where, they, were, displayed, on, repeater, dials, to, the, layers, who, matched, pointers, target, data, and, the, gun, s, actual, data, to, lay, the, guns, this, system, of, repeater, electrical, dials, built, on, the, arrangements, introduced, by, british, coast, artillery, in, the, 1880s, and, coast, artillery, was, the, background, of, many, aa, officers, similar, systems, were, adopted, in, other, countries, and, for, example, the, later, sperry, m3a3, in, the, us, was, also, used, by, britain, as, the, predictor, aa, no, 2, height, finders, were, also, increasing, in, size, in, britain, the, seven, foot, optical, base, world, war, i, barr, stroud, ub, 2, stereoscopic, rangefinder, was, replaced, by, the, nine, foot, optical, base, ub, 7, and, the, eighteen, foot, optical, base, ub, 10, only, used, on, static, aa, sites, goertz, in, germany, and, levallois, in, france, produced, five, m, 16, ft, instruments, however, in, most, countries, the, main, effort, in, haa, guns, until, the, mid, 1930s, was, improving, existing, ones, although, various, new, designs, were, on, drawing, boards, from, the, early, 1930s, eight, countries, developed, radar, these, developments, were, sufficiently, advanced, by, the, late, 1930s, for, development, work, on, sound, locating, acoustic, devices, to, be, generally, halted, although, equipment, was, retained, furthermore, in, britain, the, volunteer, observer, corps, formed, in, 1925, provided, a, network, of, observation, posts, to, report, hostile, aircraft, flying, over, britain, initially, radar, was, used, for, airspace, surveillance, to, detect, approaching, hostile, aircraft, however, the, german, w, rzburg, radar, put, into, use, in, 1940, was, capable, of, providing, data, suitable, for, controlling, aa, guns, and, the, british, radar, gun, laying, mark, i, was, designed, to, be, used, on, aa, gun, positions, and, was, in, use, by, 1939, the, treaty, of, versailles, prevented, germany, having, aa, weapons, and, for, example, the, krupps, designers, joined, bofors, in, sweden, some, world, war, i, guns, were, retained, and, some, covert, aa, training, started, in, the, late, 1920s, germany, introduced, the, 8, 8, cm, flak, 18, in, 1933, the, 36, and, 37, models, followed, with, various, improvements, but, ballistic, performance, was, unchanged, in, the, late, 1930s, the, 10, 5, cm, flak, 38, appeared, soon, followed, by, the, 39, this, was, designed, primarily, for, static, sites, but, had, a, mobile, mounting, and, the, unit, had, 220, v, 24, kw, generators, in, 1938, design, started, on, the, 12, 8, cm, flak, britain, had, successfully, tested, a, new, 3, 6, inch, gun, in, 1918, in, 1928, a, 3, 7, inch, 94, mm, gun, became, the, preferred, solution, but, it, took, six, years, to, gain, funding, production, of, the, qf, 3, 7, inch, gun, began, in, 1937, this, gun, was, used, on, mobile, carriages, with, the, field, army, and, transportable, guns, on, fixed, mountings, for, static, positions, at, the, same, time, the, royal, navy, adopted, a, new, 4, 5, inch, 113, mm, gun, in, a, twin, turret, which, the, army, adopted, in, simplified, single, gun, mountings, for, static, positions, mostly, around, ports, where, naval, ammunition, was, available, the, performance, of, the, new, guns, was, limited, by, their, standard, fuse, no, 199, with, a, 30, second, running, time, although, a, new, mechanical, time, fuse, giving, 43, seconds, was, nearing, readiness, in, 1939, a, machine, fuse, setter, was, introduced, to, eliminate, manual, fuse, setting, the, us, ended, world, war, i, with, two, 3, inch, aa, guns, and, improvements, were, developed, throughout, the, inter, war, period, however, in, 1924, work, started, on, a, new, 105, mm, static, mounting, aa, gun, but, only, a, few, were, produced, by, the, mid, 1930s, because, by, this, time, work, had, started, on, the, 90, mm, aa, gun, with, mobile, carriages, and, static, mountings, able, to, engage, air, sea, and, ground, targets, the, m1, version, was, approved, in, 1940, during, the, 1920s, there, was, some, work, on, a, 4, 7, inch, which, lapsed, but, revived, in, 1937, leading, to, a, new, gun, in, 1944, while, haa, and, its, associated, target, acquisition, and, fire, control, was, the, primary, focus, of, aa, efforts, low, level, close, range, targets, remained, and, by, the, mid, 1930s, were, becoming, an, issue, until, this, time, the, british, at, raf, insistence, continued, their, use, of, world, war, i, machine, guns, and, introduced, twin, mg, mountings, for, aaad, the, army, was, forbidden, from, considering, anything, larger, than, 50, inch, however, in, 1935, their, trials, showed, that, the, minimum, effective, round, was, an, impact, fused, 2, lb, he, shell, the, following, year, they, decided, to, adopt, the, bofors, 40, mm, and, a, twin, barrel, vickers, 2, pdr, 40, mm, on, a, modified, naval, mount, the, air, cooled, bofors, was, vastly, superior, for, land, use, being, much, lighter, than, the, water, cooled, pom, pom, and, uk, production, of, the, bofors, 40, mm, was, licensed, the, predictor, aa, no, 3, as, the, kerrison, predictor, was, officially, known, was, introduced, with, it, the, 40, mm, bofors, had, become, available, in, 1931, in, the, late, 1920s, the, swedish, navy, had, ordered, the, development, of, a, 40, mm, naval, anti, aircraft, gun, from, the, bofors, company, it, was, light, rapid, firing, and, reliable, and, a, mobile, version, on, a, four, wheel, carriage, was, soon, developed, known, simply, as, the, 40, mm, it, was, adopted, by, some, 17, different, nations, just, before, world, war, ii, and, is, still, in, use, today, in, some, applications, such, as, on, coastguard, frigates, rheinmetall, in, germany, developed, an, automatic, 20, mm, in, the, 1920s, and, oerlikon, in, switzerland, had, acquired, the, patent, to, an, automatic, 20, mm, gun, designed, in, germany, during, world, war, i, germany, introduced, the, rapid, fire, 2, cm, flak, 30, and, later, in, the, decade, it, was, redesigned, by, mauser, werke, and, became, the, 2, cm, flak, 38, nevertheless, while, 20, mm, was, better, than, a, machine, gun, and, mounted, on, a, very, small, trailer, made, it, easy, to, move, its, effectiveness, was, limited, germany, therefore, added, a, 3, 7, cm, the, first, the, 3, 7, cm, flak, 18, developed, by, rheinmetall, in, the, early, 1930s, was, basically, an, enlarged, 2, cm, flak, 30, it, was, introduced, in, 1935, and, production, stopped, the, following, year, a, redesigned, gun, 3, 7, cm, flak, 36, entered, service, in, 1938, it, too, had, a, two, wheel, carriage, however, by, the, mid, 1930s, the, luftwaffe, realised, that, there, was, still, a, coverage, gap, between, 3, 7, cm, and, 8, 8, cm, guns, they, started, development, of, a, 5, cm, gun, on, a, four, wheel, carriage, after, world, war, i, the, us, army, started, developing, a, dual, role, aa, ground, automatic, 37, mm, cannon, designed, by, john, m, browning, it, was, standardised, in, 1927, as, the, t9, aa, cannon, but, trials, quickly, revealed, that, it, was, worthless, in, the, ground, role, however, while, the, shell, was, a, bit, light, well, under, 2, lbs, it, had, a, good, effective, ceiling, and, fired, 125, rounds, per, minute, an, aa, carriage, was, developed, and, it, entered, service, in, 1939, as, the, 37, mm, gun, m1, it, proved, prone, to, jamming, and, was, eventually, replaced, in, aa, units, by, the, bofors, 40, mm, the, bofors, had, attracted, attention, from, the, us, navy, but, none, were, acquired, before, 1939, also, in, 1931, the, us, army, worked, on, a, mobile, anti, aircraft, machine, mount, on, the, back, of, a, heavy, truck, having, four, 30, calibre, water, cooled, machine, guns, and, an, optical, director, it, proved, unsuccessful, and, was, abandoned, the, ussr, introduced, a, new, 76, mm, m1931, in, 1937, an, 85, mm, m1938, and, developed, the, 37, mm, m1939, 61, k, which, appears, to, have, been, copied, from, the, bofors, 40, mm, a, bofors, 25, mm, essentially, a, scaled, down, 40, mm, was, also, copied, as, the, 25, mm, m1939, during, the, 1930s, solid, fuel, rockets, were, under, development, in, the, soviet, union, and, britain, in, britain, the, interest, was, for, anti, aircraft, fire, it, quickly, became, clear, that, guidance, would, be, required, for, precision, however, rockets, or, unrotated, projectiles, as, they, were, called, could, be, used, for, anti, aircraft, barrages, a, two, inch, rocket, using, he, or, wire, obstacle, warheads, the, z, battery, was, introduced, first, to, deal, with, low, level, or, dive, bombing, attacks, on, smaller, targets, such, as, airfields, the, three, inch, was, in, development, at, the, end, of, the, inter, war, period, wwi, had, been, a, war, in, which, air, warfare, blossomed, but, had, not, matured, to, the, point, of, being, a, real, threat, to, naval, forces, the, prevailing, assumption, was, that, a, few, relatively, small, caliber, naval, guns, could, manage, to, keep, enemy, aircraft, beyond, a, range, where, harm, might, be, expected, in, 1939, radio, controlled, target, drones, became, available, to, the, us, navy, in, quantity, allowing, a, more, realistic, testing, of, existing, anti, aircraft, suites, against, actual, flying, and, manoeuvring, targets, the, results, were, sobering, to, an, unexpected, degree, the, united, states, was, still, emerging, from, the, effects, of, the, great, depression, and, funds, for, the, military, had, been, sparse, to, the, degree, that, 50, of, shells, used, were, still, powder, fused, the, us, navy, found, that, a, significant, portion, of, its, shells, were, duds, or, low, order, detonations, incomplete, detonation, of, the, explosive, contained, by, the, shell, virtually, every, major, country, involved, in, combat, in, world, war, ii, invested, in, aircraft, development, the, cost, of, aircraft, research, and, development, was, small, and, the, results, could, be, large, so, rapid, was, the, performance, leaps, of, evolving, aircraft, that, the, british, high, angle, control, system, hacs, was, obsolete, and, designing, a, successor, very, difficult, for, the, british, establishment, electronics, would, prove, to, be, an, enabler, for, effective, anti, aircraft, systems, and, both, the, us, and, uk, had, a, growing, electronics, industry, in, 1939, radio, controlled, drones, became, available, to, actually, test, existing, systems, in, british, and, american, service, the, results, were, disappointing, by, any, measure, high, level, manoeuvring, drones, were, virtually, immune, to, shipboard, aa, systems, the, us, drones, could, simulate, dive, bombing, which, showed, the, dire, need, for, autocannons, japan, introduced, powered, gliders, in, 1940, as, drones, but, apparently, was, unable, to, dive, bomb, there, is, no, evidence, of, other, powers, using, drones, in, this, application, at, all, it, may, have, caused, a, major, underestimation, of, the, threat, and, an, inflated, view, of, their, aa, systems, poland, s, aa, defences, were, no, match, for, the, german, attack, and, the, situation, was, similar, in, other, european, countries, significant, aaw, anti, air, warfare, started, with, the, battle, of, britain, in, the, summer, of, 1940, qf, 3, 7, inch, aa, guns, provided, the, backbone, of, the, ground, based, aa, defences, although, initially, significant, numbers, of, qf, 3, inch, 20, cwt, were, also, used, the, army, s, anti, aircraft, command, which, was, under, operational, command, of, raf, fighter, command, within, air, defence, gb, grew, to, 12, aa, divisions, in, three, aa, corps, bofors, 40, mm, guns, entered, service, in, increasing, numbers, in, addition, the, raf, regiment, was, formed, in, 1941, with, responsibility, for, airfield, air, defence, eventually, with, bofors, 40, mm, as, their, main, armament, fixed, aa, defences, using, haa, and, laa, were, established, by, the, army, in, key, overseas, places, notably, malta, suez, canal, and, singapore, while, the, 3, 7, inch, was, the, main, haa, gun, in, fixed, defences, and, the, only, mobile, haa, gun, with, the, field, army, the, qf, 4, 5, inch, gun, manned, by, artillery, was, used, in, the, vicinity, of, naval, ports, and, made, use, of, the, naval, ammunition, supply, the, 4, 5, inch, at, singapore, had, the, first, success, in, shooting, down, japanese, bombers, mid, war, qf, 5, 25, inch, naval, guns, started, being, emplaced, in, some, permanent, sites, around, london, this, gun, was, also, deployed, in, dual, role, coast, defence, aa, positions, germany, s, high, altitude, needs, were, originally, going, to, be, filled, by, a, 75, mm, gun, from, krupp, designed, in, collaboration, with, their, swedish, counterpart, bofors, but, the, specifications, were, later, amended, to, require, much, higher, performance, in, response, krupp, s, engineers, presented, a, new, 88, mm, design, the, flak, 36, first, used, in, spain, during, the, spanish, civil, war, the, gun, proved, to, be, one, of, the, best, anti, aircraft, guns, in, the, world, as, well, as, particularly, deadly, against, light, medium, and, even, early, heavy, tanks, after, the, dambusters, raid, in, 1943, an, entirely, new, system, was, developed, that, was, required, to, knock, down, any, low, flying, aircraft, with, a, single, hit, the, first, attempt, to, produce, such, a, system, used, a, 50, mm, gun, but, this, proved, inaccurate, and, a, new, 55, mm, gun, replaced, it, the, system, used, a, centralised, control, system, including, both, search, and, targeting, radar, which, calculated, the, aim, point, for, the, guns, after, considering, windage, and, ballistics, and, then, sent, electrical, commands, to, the, guns, which, used, hydraulics, to, point, themselves, at, high, speeds, operators, simply, fed, the, guns, and, selected, the, targets, this, system, modern, even, by, today, s, standards, was, in, late, development, when, the, war, ended, the, british, had, already, arranged, licence, building, of, the, bofors, 40, mm, and, introduced, these, into, service, these, had, the, power, to, knock, down, aircraft, of, any, size, yet, were, light, enough, to, be, mobile, and, easily, swung, the, gun, became, so, important, to, the, british, war, effort, that, they, even, produced, a, movie, the, gun, that, encouraged, workers, on, the, assembly, line, to, work, harder, the, imperial, measurement, production, drawings, the, british, had, developed, were, supplied, to, the, americans, who, produced, their, own, unlicensed, copy, of, the, 40, mm, at, the, start, of, the, war, moving, to, licensed, production, in, mid, 1941, service, trials, demonstrated, another, problem, however, that, ranging, and, tracking, the, new, high, speed, targets, was, almost, impossible, at, short, range, the, apparent, target, area, is, relatively, large, the, trajectory, is, flat, and, the, time, of, flight, is, short, allowing, to, correct, lead, by, watching, the, tracers, at, long, range, the, aircraft, remains, in, firing, range, for, a, long, time, so, the, necessary, calculations, can, in, theory, be, done, by, slide, rules, though, because, small, errors, in, distance, cause, large, errors, in, shell, fall, height, and, detonation, time, exact, ranging, is, crucial, for, the, ranges, and, speeds, that, the, bofors, worked, at, neither, answer, was, good, enough, the, solution, was, automation, in, the, form, of, a, mechanical, computer, the, kerrison, predictor, operators, kept, it, pointed, at, the, target, and, the, predictor, then, calculated, the, proper, aim, point, automatically, and, displayed, it, as, a, pointer, mounted, on, the, gun, the, gun, operators, simply, followed, the, pointer, and, loaded, the, shells, the, kerrison, was, fairly, simple, but, it, pointed, the, way, to, future, generations, that, incorporated, radar, first, for, ranging, and, later, for, tracking, similar, predictor, systems, were, introduced, by, germany, during, the, war, also, adding, radar, ranging, as, the, war, progressed, a, plethora, of, anti, aircraft, gun, systems, of, smaller, calibre, was, available, to, the, german, wehrmacht, combined, forces, and, among, them, the, 1940, origin, flakvierling, quadruple, 20, mm, autocannon, based, anti, aircraft, weapon, system, was, one, of, the, most, often, seen, weapons, seeing, service, on, both, land, and, sea, the, similar, allied, smaller, calibre, air, defence, weapons, of, the, american, forces, were, also, quite, capable, their, needs, could, cogently, be, met, with, smaller, calibre, ordnance, beyond, using, the, usual, singly, mounted, m2, 50, caliber, machine, gun, atop, a, tank, s, turret, as, four, of, the, ground, used, heavy, barrel, m2hb, guns, were, mounted, together, on, the, american, maxson, m45, quadmount, weapon, as, a, direct, answer, to, the, flakvierling, which, were, often, mounted, on, the, back, of, a, half, track, to, form, the, m16, multiple, gun, motor, carriage, although, of, less, power, than, germany, s, 20, mm, systems, the, typical, four, or, five, combat, batteries, of, an, army, aaa, battalion, were, often, spread, many, kilometres, apart, from, each, other, rapidly, attaching, and, detaching, to, larger, ground, combat, units, to, provide, welcome, defence, from, enemy, aircraft, aaa, battalions, were, also, used, to, help, suppress, ground, targets, their, larger, 90, mm, m3, gun, would, prove, as, did, the, eighty, eight, to, make, an, excellent, anti, tank, gun, as, well, and, was, widely, used, late, in, the, war, in, this, role, also, available, to, the, americans, at, the, start, of, the, war, was, the, 120, mm, m1, gun, stratosphere, gun, which, was, the, most, powerful, aa, gun, with, an, impressive, 60, 000, ft, 18, km, altitude, capability, however, no, 120, m1, was, ever, fired, at, an, enemy, aircraft, the, 90, mm, and, 120, mm, guns, continued, to, be, used, into, the, 1950s, the, united, states, navy, had, also, put, some, thought, into, the, problem, when, the, us, navy, began, to, rearm, in, 1939, in, many, ships, the, primary, short, ranged, gun, was, the, m2, 50, caliber, machine, gun, while, effective, in, fighters, at, 300, to, 400, yards, this, is, point, blank, range, in, naval, anti, aircraft, ranges, production, of, the, swiss, oerlikon, 20, mm, had, already, started, to, provide, protection, for, the, british, and, this, was, adopted, in, exchange, for, the, m2, machine, guns, from, december, 1941, to, january, 1942, production, had, risen, to, not, only, cover, all, british, requirements, but, also, allowed, 812, units, to, be, actually, delivered, to, the, us, navy, by, the, end, of, 1942, the, 20, mm, had, accounted, for, 42, of, all, aircraft, destroyed, by, the, us, navy, s, shipboard, aa, however, the, king, board, had, noted, that, the, balance, was, shifting, towards, the, larger, guns, used, by, the, fleet, the, us, navy, had, intended, to, use, the, british, pom, pom, however, the, weapon, required, the, use, of, cordite, which, buord, had, found, objectionable, for, us, service, further, investigation, revealed, that, us, powders, would, not, work, in, the, pom, pom, bureau, of, ordnance, was, well, aware, of, the, bofors, 40, mm, gun, the, firm, york, safe, and, lock, was, negotiating, with, bofors, to, attain, the, rights, to, the, air, cooled, version, of, the, weapon, at, the, same, time, henry, howard, an, engineer, and, businessman, became, aware, of, it, and, contacted, ramd, w, r, furlong, chief, of, the, bureau, of, ordnance, he, ordered, the, bofors, weapon, system, to, be, investigated, york, safe, and, lock, would, be, used, as, the, contracting, agent, the, system, had, to, be, redesigned, for, both, the, english, measurement, system, and, mass, production, as, the, original, documents, recommended, hand, fitting, parts, and, drilling, to, shape, as, early, as, 1928, the, us, navy, saw, the, need, to, replace, the, 50, caliber, machine, gun, with, something, heavier, the, 1, 1, 75, 28, mm, mark, 1, was, designed, placed, in, quadruple, mounts, with, a, 500, rpm, rate, of, fire, it, would, have, fit, the, requirements, however, the, gun, was, suffering, teething, issues, being, prone, to, jamming, while, this, could, have, been, solved, the, weight, of, the, system, was, equal, to, that, of, the, quad, mount, bofors, 40, mm, while, lacking, the, range, and, power, that, the, bofors, provided, the, gun, was, relegated, to, smaller, less, vital, ships, by, the, end, of, the, war, the, 5, 38, naval, gun, rounded, out, the, us, navy, s, aa, suite, a, dual, purpose, mount, it, was, used, in, both, the, surface, and, aa, roles, with, great, success, mated, with, the, mark, 37, director, and, the, proximity, fuse, it, could, routinely, knock, drones, out, of, the, sky, at, ranges, as, far, as, 13, 000, yards, a, 3, 50, mk, 22, semiautomatic, dual, gun, was, produced, but, not, employed, before, the, end, of, the, war, and, therefore, beyond, the, scope, of, this, article, however, early, marks, of, the, 3, 50, were, employed, in, destroyer, escorts, and, on, merchant, ships, 3, 50, caliber, guns, marks, 10, 17, 18, and, 20, first, entered, service, in, 1915, as, a, refit, to, uss, texas, bb, 35, and, were, subsequently, mounted, on, many, types, of, ships, as, the, need, for, anti, aircraft, protection, was, recognized, during, world, war, ii, they, were, the, primary, gun, armament, on, destroyer, escorts, patrol, frigates, submarine, chasers, minesweepers, some, fleet, submarines, and, other, auxiliary, vessels, and, were, used, as, a, secondary, dual, purpose, battery, on, some, other, types, of, ships, including, some, older, battleships, they, also, replaced, the, original, low, angle, 4, 50, caliber, guns, mark, 9, on, flush, deck, wickes, and, clemson, class, destroyers, to, provide, better, anti, aircraft, protection, the, gun, was, also, used, on, specialist, destroyer, conversions, the, avd, seaplane, tender, conversions, received, two, guns, the, apd, high, speed, transports, dm, minelayers, and, dms, minesweeper, conversions, received, three, guns, and, those, retaining, destroyer, classification, received, six, the, germans, developed, massive, reinforced, concrete, blockhouses, some, more, than, six, stories, high, which, were, known, as, hochbunker, high, bunkers, or, flakt, rme, flak, towers, on, which, they, placed, anti, aircraft, artillery, those, in, cities, attacked, by, the, allied, land, forces, became, fortresses, several, in, berlin, were, some, of, the, last, buildings, to, fall, to, the, soviets, during, the, battle, of, berlin, in, 1945, the, british, built, structures, such, as, the, maunsell, forts, in, the, north, sea, the, thames, estuary, and, other, tidal, areas, upon, which, they, based, guns, after, the, war, most, were, left, to, rot, some, were, outside, territorial, waters, and, had, a, second, life, in, the, 1960s, as, platforms, for, pirate, radio, stations, while, another, became, the, base, of, a, micronation, the, principality, of, sealand, some, nations, started, rocket, research, before, world, war, ii, including, for, anti, aircraft, use, further, research, started, during, the, war, the, first, step, was, unguided, missile, systems, like, the, british, 2, inch, rp, and, 3, inch, which, was, fired, in, large, numbers, from, z, batteries, and, were, also, fitted, to, warships, the, firing, of, one, of, these, devices, during, an, air, raid, is, suspected, to, have, caused, the, bethnal, green, disaster, in, 1943, facing, the, threat, of, japanese, kamikaze, attacks, the, british, and, us, developed, surface, to, air, rockets, like, british, fairey, stooge, or, the, american, lark, as, counter, measures, but, none, of, them, were, ready, at, the, end, of, the, war, the, germans, missile, research, was, the, most, advanced, of, the, war, as, the, germans, put, considerable, effort, in, the, research, and, development, of, rocket, systems, for, all, purposes, among, them, were, several, guided, and, unguided, systems, unguided, systems, involved, the, fliegerfaust, literally, aircraft, fist, rocket, launcher, as, the, first, manpads, guided, systems, were, several, sophisticated, radio, wire, or, radar, guided, missiles, like, the, wasserfall, waterfall, rocket, owing, to, the, severe, war, situation, for, germany, all, of, those, systems, were, only, produced, in, small, numbers, and, most, of, them, were, only, used, by, training, or, trial, units, another, aspect, of, anti, aircraft, defence, was, the, use, of, barrage, balloons, to, act, as, physical, obstacle, initially, to, bomber, aircraft, over, cities, and, later, for, ground, attack, aircraft, over, the, normandy, invasion, fleets, the, balloon, a, simple, blimp, tethered, to, the, ground, worked, in, two, ways, firstly, it, and, the, steel, cable, were, a, danger, to, any, aircraft, that, tried, to, fly, among, them, secondly, to, avoid, the, balloons, bombers, had, to, fly, at, a, higher, altitude, which, was, more, favourable, for, the, guns, barrage, balloons, were, limited, in, application, and, had, minimal, success, at, bringing, down, aircraft, being, largely, immobile, and, passive, defences, the, allies, most, advanced, technologies, were, showcased, by, the, anti, aircraft, defence, against, the, german, v, 1, cruise, missiles, v, stands, for, vergeltungswaffe, retaliation, weapon, the, 419th, and, 601st, anti, aircraft, gun, battalions, of, the, us, army, were, first, allocated, to, the, folkestone, dover, coast, to, defend, london, and, then, moved, to, belgium, to, become, part, of, the, antwerp, x, project, coordinated, from, the, le, grand, veneur, in, keerbergen, with, the, liberation, of, antwerp, the, port, city, immediately, became, the, highest, priority, target, and, received, the, largest, number, of, v, 1, and, v, 2, missiles, of, any, city, the, smallest, tactical, unit, of, the, operation, was, a, gun, battery, consisting, of, four, 90, mm, guns, firing, shells, equipped, with, a, radio, proximity, fuse, incoming, targets, were, acquired, and, automatically, tracked, by, scr, 584, radar, output, from, the, gun, laying, radar, was, fed, to, the, m9, gun, director, an, electronic, analogue, computer, to, calculate, the, lead, and, elevation, corrections, for, the, guns, with, the, help, of, these, three, technologies, close, to, 90, of, the, v, 1, missiles, on, track, to, the, defence, zone, around, the, port, were, destroyed, post, war, analysis, demonstrated, that, even, with, newest, anti, aircraft, systems, employed, by, both, sides, the, vast, majority, of, bombers, reached, their, targets, successfully, on, the, order, of, 90, while, these, figures, were, undesirable, during, the, war, the, advent, of, the, nuclear, bomb, considerably, altered, the, acceptability, of, even, a, single, bomber, reaching, its, target, the, developments, during, world, war, ii, continued, for, a, short, time, into, the, post, war, period, as, well, in, particular, the, us, army, set, up, a, huge, air, defence, network, around, its, larger, cities, based, on, radar, guided, 90, mm, and, 120, mm, guns, us, efforts, continued, into, the, 1950s, with, the, 75, mm, skysweeper, system, an, almost, fully, automated, system, including, the, radar, computers, power, and, auto, loading, gun, on, a, single, powered, platform, the, skysweeper, replaced, all, smaller, guns, then, in, use, in, the, army, notably, the, 40, mm, bofors, by, 1955, the, us, military, deemed, the, 40, mm, bofors, obsolete, due, to, its, reduced, capability, to, shoot, down, jet, powered, aircraft, and, turned, to, sam, development, with, the, nike, ajax, and, the, rsd, 58, in, europe, nato, s, allied, command, europe, developed, an, integrated, air, defence, system, nato, air, defence, ground, environment, nadge, that, later, became, the, nato, integrated, air, defence, system, the, introduction, of, the, guided, missile, resulted, in, a, significant, shift, in, anti, aircraft, strategy, although, germany, had, been, desperate, to, introduce, anti, aircraft, missile, systems, none, became, operational, during, world, war, ii, following, several, years, of, post, war, development, however, these, systems, began, to, mature, into, viable, weapons, the, us, started, an, upgrade, of, their, defences, using, the, nike, ajax, missile, and, soon, the, larger, anti, aircraft, guns, disappeared, the, same, thing, occurred, in, the, ussr, after, the, introduction, of, their, sa, 2, guideline, systems, as, this, process, continued, the, missile, found, itself, being, used, for, more, and, more, of, the, roles, formerly, filled, by, guns, first, to, go, were, the, large, weapons, replaced, by, equally, large, missile, systems, of, much, higher, performance, smaller, missiles, soon, followed, eventually, becoming, small, enough, to, be, mounted, on, armoured, cars, and, tank, chassis, these, started, replacing, or, at, least, supplanting, similar, gun, based, spaag, systems, in, the, 1960s, and, by, the, 1990s, had, replaced, almost, all, such, systems, in, modern, armies, man, portable, missiles, manpads, as, they, are, known, today, were, introduced, in, the, 1960s, and, have, supplanted, or, replaced, even, the, smallest, guns, in, most, advanced, armies, in, the, 1982, falklands, war, the, argentine, armed, forces, deployed, the, newest, west, european, weapons, including, the, 35, mm, oerlikon, gdf, 002, twin, cannon, and, roland, missile, the, rapier, missile, system, was, the, primary, gbad, system, used, by, both, british, artillery, and, raf, regiment, a, few, brand, new, fim, 92, stinger, were, used, by, british, special, forces, both, sides, also, used, the, blowpipe, missile, british, naval, missiles, used, included, sea, dart, and, the, older, sea, slug, longer, range, systems, seacat, and, the, new, sea, wolf, short, range, systems, machine, guns, in, aa, mountings, were, used, both, ashore, and, afloat, during, the, 2008, south, ossetia, war, air, power, faced, off, against, powerful, sam, systems, like, the, 1980s, buk, m1, in, february, 2018, an, israeli, f, 16, fighter, was, downed, in, the, occupied, golan, heights, province, after, it, had, attacked, an, iranian, target, in, syria, in, 2006, israel, also, lost, a, helicopter, over, lebanon, shot, down, by, a, hezbollah, rocket, although, the, firearms, used, by, the, infantry, particularly, machine, guns, can, be, used, to, engage, low, altitude, air, targets, on, occasion, with, notable, success, their, effectiveness, is, generally, limited, and, the, muzzle, flashes, reveal, infantry, positions, speed, and, altitude, of, modern, jet, aircraft, limit, target, opportunities, and, critical, systems, may, be, armoured, in, aircraft, designed, for, the, ground, attack, role, adaptations, of, the, standard, autocannon, originally, intended, for, air, to, ground, use, and, heavier, artillery, systems, were, commonly, used, for, most, anti, aircraft, gunnery, starting, with, standard, pieces, on, new, mountings, and, evolving, to, specially, designed, guns, with, much, higher, performance, prior, to, world, war, ii, the, shells, fired, by, these, weapons, are, usually, fitted, with, different, types, of, fuses, barometric, time, delay, or, proximity, to, explode, close, to, the, airborne, target, releasing, a, shower, of, fast, metal, fragments, for, shorter, range, work, a, lighter, weapon, with, a, higher, rate, of, fire, is, required, to, increase, a, hit, probability, on, a, fast, airborne, target, weapons, between, 20, mm, and, 40, mm, calibre, have, been, widely, used, in, this, role, smaller, weapons, typically, 50, calibre, or, even, 8, mm, rifle, calibre, guns, have, been, used, in, the, smallest, mounts, unlike, the, heavier, guns, these, smaller, weapons, are, in, widespread, use, due, to, their, low, cost, and, ability, to, quickly, follow, the, target, classic, examples, of, autocannons, and, large, calibre, guns, are, the, 40, mm, autocannon, from, bofors, and, the, 8, 8, cm, flak, 18, 36, gun, designed, by, krupp, artillery, weapons, of, this, sort, have, for, the, most, part, been, superseded, by, the, effective, surface, to, air, missile, systems, that, were, introduced, in, the, 1950s, although, they, were, still, retained, by, many, nations, the, development, of, surface, to, air, missiles, began, in, nazi, germany, during, the, late, world, war, ii, with, missiles, such, as, the, wasserfall, though, no, working, system, was, deployed, before, the, war, s, end, and, represented, new, attempts, to, increase, effectiveness, of, the, anti, aircraft, systems, faced, with, growing, threat, from, bombers, land, based, sams, can, be, deployed, from, fixed, installations, or, mobile, launchers, either, wheeled, or, tracked, the, tracked, vehicles, are, usually, armoured, vehicles, specifically, designed, to, carry, sams, larger, sams, may, be, deployed, in, fixed, launchers, but, can, be, towed, re, deployed, at, will, the, sams, launched, by, individuals, are, known, in, the, united, states, as, the, man, portable, air, defence, systems, manpads, manpads, of, the, former, soviet, union, have, been, exported, around, the, world, and, can, be, found, in, use, by, many, armed, forces, targets, for, non, manpad, sams, will, usually, be, acquired, by, air, search, radar, then, tracked, before, while, a, sam, is, locked, on, and, then, fired, potential, targets, if, they, are, military, aircraft, will, be, identified, as, friend, or, foe, before, being, engaged, the, developments, in, the, latest, and, relatively, cheap, short, range, missiles, have, begun, to, replace, autocannons, in, this, role, the, interceptor, aircraft, or, simply, interceptor, is, a, type, of, fighter, aircraft, designed, specifically, to, intercept, and, destroy, enemy, aircraft, particularly, bombers, usually, relying, on, high, speed, and, altitude, capabilities, a, number, of, jet, interceptors, such, as, the, f, 102, delta, dagger, the, f, 106, delta, dart, and, the, mig, 25, were, built, in, the, period, starting, after, the, end, of, world, war, ii, and, ending, in, the, late, 1960s, when, they, became, less, important, due, to, the, shifting, of, the, strategic, bombing, role, to, icbms, invariably, the, type, is, differentiated, from, other, fighter, aircraft, designs, by, higher, speeds, and, shorter, operating, ranges, as, well, as, much, reduced, ordnance, payloads, the, radar, systems, use, electromagnetic, waves, to, identify, the, range, altitude, direction, or, speed, of, aircraft, and, weather, formations, to, provide, tactical, and, operational, warning, and, direction, primarily, during, defensive, operations, in, their, functional, roles, they, provide, target, search, threat, detection, guidance, reconnaissance, navigation, instrumentation, and, weather, reporting, support, to, combat, operations, an, anti, uav, defence, system, auds, is, a, system, for, defence, against, military, unmanned, aerial, vehicles, a, variety, of, designs, have, been, developed, using, lasers, net, guns, and, air, to, air, netting, signal, jamming, and, hi, jacking, by, means, of, in, flight, hacking, anti, uav, defence, systems, have, been, deployed, against, isil, drones, during, the, battle, of, mosul, 2016, 2017, alternative, approaches, for, dealing, with, uavs, have, included, using, a, shotgun, at, close, range, and, for, smaller, drones, training, eagles, to, snatch, them, from, the, air, this, only, works, on, relatively, small, uavs, and, loitering, munitions, also, called, suicide, drones, larger, ucavs, such, as, the, mq, 1, predator, can, be, and, frequently, are, shot, down, like, manned, aircraft, of, similar, sizes, and, flight, profiles, guns, are, being, increasingly, pushed, into, specialist, roles, such, as, the, dutch, goalkeeper, ciws, which, uses, the, gau, 8, avenger, 30, mm, seven, barrel, gatling, gun, for, last, ditch, anti, missile, and, anti, aircraft, defence, even, this, formerly, front, line, weapon, is, currently, being, replaced, by, new, missile, systems, such, as, the, rim, 116, rolling, airframe, missile, which, is, smaller, faster, and, allows, for, mid, flight, course, correction, guidance, to, ensure, a, hit, to, bridge, the, gap, between, guns, and, missiles, russia, in, particular, produces, the, kashtan, ciws, which, uses, both, guns, and, missiles, for, final, defence, with, two, six, barrelled, 30, mm, gsh, 6, 30, rotary, canon, and, eight, 9m311, surface, to, air, missiles, provide, for, its, defensive, capabilities, upsetting, this, development, to, all, missile, systems, is, the, current, move, to, stealth, aircraft, long, range, missiles, depend, on, long, range, detection, to, provide, significant, lead, stealth, designs, cut, detection, ranges, so, much, that, the, aircraft, is, often, never, even, seen, and, when, it, is, it, is, often, too, late, for, an, intercept, systems, for, detection, and, tracking, of, stealthy, aircraft, are, a, major, problem, for, anti, aircraft, development, however, as, stealth, technology, grows, so, does, anti, stealth, technology, multiple, transmitter, radars, such, as, those, from, bistatic, radars, and, low, frequency, radars, are, said, to, have, the, capabilities, to, detect, stealth, aircraft, advanced, forms, of, thermographic, cameras, such, as, those, that, incorporate, qwips, would, be, able, to, optically, see, a, stealth, aircraft, regardless, of, the, aircraft, s, radar, cross, section, rcs, in, addition, side, looking, radars, high, powered, optical, satellites, and, sky, scanning, high, aperture, high, sensitivity, radars, such, as, radio, telescopes, would, all, be, able, to, narrow, down, the, location, of, a, stealth, aircraft, under, certain, parameters, the, newest, sams, have, a, claimed, ability, to, be, able, to, detect, and, engage, stealth, targets, with, the, most, notable, being, the, russian, s, 400, which, is, claimed, to, be, able, to, detect, a, target, with, a, 0, 05, square, metre, rcs, from, 90, km, away, another, potential, weapon, system, for, anti, aircraft, use, is, the, laser, although, air, planners, have, imagined, lasers, in, combat, since, the, late, 1960s, only, the, most, modern, laser, systems, are, currently, reaching, what, could, be, considered, experimental, usefulness, in, particular, the, tactical, high, energy, laser, can, be, used, in, the, anti, aircraft, and, anti, missile, role, the, alka, directed, energy, weapon, dew, system, is, a, turkish, dual, electromagnetic, laser, weapon, developed, by, roketsan, allegedly, used, to, destroy, one, of, gnc, s, wing, loong, ii, uavs, if, true, this, would, represent, the, first, known, time, a, vehicle, mounted, combat, laser, was, used, to, destroy, another, combat, vehicle, during, genuine, wartime, conditions, the, future, of, projectile, based, weapons, may, be, found, in, the, railgun, currently, tests, are, underway, on, developing, systems, that, could, create, as, much, damage, as, a, tomahawk, but, at, a, fraction, of, the, cost, in, february, 2008, the, us, navy, tested, a, railgun, it, fired, a, shell, at, 5, 600, miles, 9, 000, km, per, hour, using, 10, megajoules, of, energy, its, expected, performance, is, over, 13, 000, miles, 21, 000, km, per, hour, muzzle, velocity, accurate, enough, to, hit, a, 5, metre, target, from, 200, nautical, miles, 370, km, away, while, shooting, at, 10, shots, per, minute, it, is, expected, to, be, ready, in, 2020, to, 2025, these, systems, while, currently, designed, for, static, targets, would, only, need, the, ability, to, be, retargeted, to, become, the, next, generation, of, aa, system, most, western, and, commonwealth, militaries, integrate, air, defence, purely, with, the, traditional, services, of, the, military, i, e, army, navy, and, air, force, as, a, separate, arm, or, as, part, of, artillery, in, the, british, army, for, instance, air, defence, is, part, of, the, artillery, arm, while, in, the, pakistan, army, it, was, split, off, from, the, artillery, to, form, a, separate, arm, of, its, own, in, 1990, this, is, in, contrast, to, some, largely, communist, or, ex, communist, countries, where, not, only, are, there, provisions, for, air, defence, in, the, army, navy, and, air, force, but, there, are, specific, branches, that, deal, only, with, the, air, defence, of, territory, for, example, the, soviet, pvo, strany, the, ussr, also, had, a, separate, strategic, rocket, force, in, charge, of, nuclear, intercontinental, ballistic, missiles, smaller, boats, and, ships, typically, have, machine, guns, or, fast, cannons, which, can, often, be, deadly, to, low, flying, aircraft, if, linked, to, a, radar, directed, fire, control, system, radar, controlled, cannon, for, point, defence, some, vessels, like, aegis, equipped, destroyers, and, cruisers, are, as, much, a, threat, to, aircraft, as, any, land, based, air, defence, system, in, general, naval, vessels, should, be, treated, with, respect, by, aircraft, however, the, reverse, is, equally, true, carrier, battle, groups, are, especially, well, defended, as, not, only, do, they, typically, consist, of, many, vessels, with, heavy, air, defence, armament, but, they, are, also, able, to, launch, fighter, jets, for, combat, air, patrol, overhead, to, intercept, incoming, airborne, threats, nations, such, as, japan, use, their, sam, equipped, vessels, to, create, an, outer, air, defence, perimeter, and, radar, picket, in, the, defence, of, its, home, islands, and, the, united, states, also, uses, its, aegis, equipped, ships, as, part, of, its, aegis, ballistic, missile, defense, system, in, the, defence, of, the, continental, united, states, some, modern, submarines, such, as, the, type, 212, submarines, of, the, german, navy, are, equipped, with, surface, to, air, missile, systems, since, helicopters, and, anti, submarine, warfare, aircraft, are, significant, threats, the, subsurface, launched, anti, air, missile, was, first, purposed, by, us, navy, rear, admiral, charles, b, momsen, in, a, 1953, article, layered, air, defence, in, naval, tactics, especially, within, a, carrier, group, is, often, built, around, a, system, of, concentric, layers, with, the, aircraft, carrier, at, the, centre, the, outer, layer, will, usually, be, provided, by, the, carrier, s, aircraft, specifically, its, aew, c, aircraft, combined, with, the, cap, if, an, attacker, is, able, to, penetrate, this, layer, then, the, next, layers, would, come, from, the, surface, to, air, missiles, carried, by, the, carrier, s, escorts, the, area, defence, missiles, such, as, the, rim, 67, standard, with, a, range, of, up, to, 100, nmi, and, the, point, defence, missiles, like, the, rim, 162, essm, with, a, range, of, up, to, 30, nmi, finally, virtually, every, modern, warship, will, be, fitted, with, small, calibre, guns, including, a, ciws, which, is, usually, a, radar, controlled, gatling, gun, of, between, 20, mm, and, 30, mm, calibre, capable, of, firing, several, thousand, rounds, per, minute, armies, typically, have, air, defence, in, depth, from, integral, man, portable, air, defense, systems, manpads, such, as, the, rbs, 70, stinger, and, igla, at, smaller, force, levels, up, to, army, level, missile, defence, systems, such, as, angara, and, patriot, often, the, high, altitude, long, range, missile, systems, force, aircraft, to, fly, at, low, level, where, anti, aircraft, guns, can, bring, them, down, as, well, as, the, small, and, large, systems, for, effective, air, defence, there, must, be, intermediate, systems, these, may, be, deployed, at, regiment, level, and, consist, of, platoons, of, self, propelled, anti, aircraft, platforms, whether, they, are, self, propelled, anti, aircraft, guns, spaags, integrated, air, defence, systems, like, 2k22, tunguska, or, all, in, one, surface, to, air, missile, platforms, like, roland, or, sa, 8, gecko, on, a, national, level, the, united, states, army, was, atypical, in, that, it, was, primarily, responsible, for, the, missile, air, defences, of, the, continental, united, states, with, systems, such, as, project, nike, air, defence, by, air, forces, is, typically, provided, by, fighter, jets, carrying, air, to, air, missiles, however, most, air, forces, choose, to, augment, airbase, defence, with, surface, to, air, missile, systems, as, they, are, such, valuable, targets, and, subject, to, attack, by, enemy, aircraft, in, addition, some, countries, choose, to, put, all, air, defence, responsibilities, under, the, air, force, area, air, defence,

networked, into, an, area, defence, system, in, which, case, it, may, be, made, up, of, several, short, range, systems, combined, to, effectively, cover, an, area, an, example, of, area, defence, is, the, defence, of, saudi, arabia, and, israel, by, mim, 104, patriot, missile, batteries, during, the, first, gulf, war, where, the, objective, was, to, cover, populated, areas, most, modern, air, defence, systems, are, fairly, mobile, even, the, larger, systems, tend, to, be, mounted, on, trailers, and, are, designed, to, be, fairly, quickly, broken, down, or, set, up, in, the, past, this, was, not, always, the, case, early, missile, systems, were, cumbersome, and, required, much, infrastructure, many, could, not, be, moved, at, all, with, the, diversification, of, air, defence, there, has, been, much, more, emphasis, on, mobility, most, modern, systems, are, usually, either, self, propelled, i, e, guns, or, missiles, are, mounted, on, a, truck, or, tracked, chassis, or, towed, even, systems, that, consist, of, many, components, transporter, erector, launchers, radars, command, posts, etc, benefit, from, being, mounted, on, a, fleet, of, vehicles, in, general, a, fixed, system, can, be, identified, attacked, and, destroyed, whereas, a, mobile, system, can, show, up, in, places, where, it, is, not, expected, soviet, systems, especially, concentrate, on, mobility, after, the, lessons, learnt, in, the, vietnam, war, between, the, us, and, vietnam, with, the, sa, 2, guideline, israel, and, the, us, air, force, in, conjunction, with, the, members, of, nato, have, developed, significant, tactics, for, air, defence, suppression, dedicated, weapons, such, as, anti, radiation, missiles, and, advanced, electronics, intelligence, and, electronic, countermeasures, platforms, seek, to, suppress, or, negate, the, effectiveness, of, an, opposing, air, defence, system, it, is, an, arms, race, as, better, jamming, countermeasures, and, anti, radiation, weapons, are, developed, so, are, better, sam, systems, with, eccm, capabilities, and, the, ability, to, shoot, down, anti, radiation, missiles, and, other, munitions, aimed, at, them, or, the, targets, they, are, defending, stinger, missiles, supplied, by, the, united, states, were, used, against, the, aircraft, of, the, soviet, union, by, the, afghan, mujahideen, during, the, soviet, occupation, of, afghanistan, in, the, cold, war, rocket, propelled, grenades, rpgs, can, be, and, often, are, used, against, hovering, helicopters, e, g, by, somali, militiamen, during, the, 1993, battle, of, mogadishu, firing, an, rpg, at, steep, angles, poses, a, danger, to, the, user, because, the, backblast, from, firing, reflects, off, the, ground, in, somalia, militia, members, sometimes, welded, a, steel, plate, onto, the, exhaust, end, of, an, rpg, s, tube, to, deflect, pressure, away, from, the, shooter, when, shooting, up, at, us, helicopters, rpgs, are, used, in, this, role, only, when, more, effective, weapons, are, not, available, another, example, of, using, rpgs, against, helicopters, is, operation, anaconda, in, march, 2002, in, afghanistan, taliban, insurgents, defending, shah, i, kot, valley, used, rpgs, in, a, direct, fire, role, against, landing, helicopters, four, rangers, were, killed, when, their, helicopter, was, shot, down, by, an, rpg, and, seal, team, member, neil, c, roberts, fell, out, of, his, helicopter, when, it, was, hit, by, two, rpgs, in, other, instances, helicopters, have, been, shot, down, in, afghanistan, during, a, mission, in, wardak, province, one, feature, that, makes, rpgs, useful, in, air, defence, is, that, they, are, fused, to, automatically, detonate, at, 920, m, if, aimed, into, the, air, this, causes, the, warhead, to, airburst, which, can, release, a, limited, but, potentially, damaging, amount, of, shrapnel, hitting, a, helicopter, landing, or, taking, off, for, insurgents, the, most, effective, method, of, countering, aircraft, is, to, attempt, to, destroy, them, on, the, ground, either, by, penetrating, an, airbase, perimeter, and, destroying, aircraft, individually, e, g, the, september, 2012, camp, bastion, raid, or, finding, a, position, where, aircraft, can, be, engaged, with, indirect, fire, such, as, mortars, a, recent, trend, emerging, during, the, syrian, civil, war, is, the, use, of, atgm, against, landing, helicopters
