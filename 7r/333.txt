or, seen, by, creating, linkages, between, otherwise, very, different, concepts, and, experiences, all, communication, and, data, processing, is, achieved, through, the, use, of, symbols, symbols, take, the, form, of, words, sounds, gestures, ideas, or, visual, images, and, are, used, to, convey, other, ideas, and, beliefs, for, example, a, red, octagon, is, a, common, symbol, for, stop, on, maps, blue, lines, often, represent, rivers, and, a, red, rose, often, symbolizes, love, and, compassion, numerals, are, symbols, for, numbers, letters, of, an, alphabet, may, be, symbols, for, certain, phonemes, and, personal, names, are, symbols, representing, individuals, the, academic, study, of, symbols, is, semiotics, in, cartography, an, organized, collection, of, symbols, forms, a, legend, for, a, map, the, word, symbol, derives, from, the, late, middle, french, masculine, noun, symbole, which, appeared, around, 1380, in, a, theological, sense, signifying, a, formula, used, in, the, roman, catholic, church, as, a, sort, of, synonym, for, the, credo, by, extension, in, the, early, renaissance, it, came, to, mean, a, maxim, or, the, external, sign, of, a, sacrament, these, meanings, were, lost, in, secular, contexts, it, was, during, the, renaissance, in, the, mid, 16th, century, that, the, word, took, on, the, meaning, that, is, dominant, today, that, of, a, natural, fact, or, object, evoking, by, its, form, or, its, nature, an, association, of, ideas, with, something, abstract, or, absent, this, appears, for, example, in, fran, ois, rabelais, le, quart, livre, in, 1552, this, french, word, derives, from, latin, where, both, the, masculine, noun, symbolus, and, the, neuter, noun, symbolum, refer, to, a, mark, or, sign, as, a, means, of, recognition, the, latin, word, derives, from, ancient, greek, symbolon, from, a, verb, meaning, put, together, compare, alluding, to, the, classical, practice, of, breaking, a, piece, of, ceramic, in, two, and, giving, one, half, to, the, person, who, would, receive, a, future, message, and, one, half, to, the, person, who, would, send, it, when, the, two, fit, perfectly, together, the, receiver, could, be, sure, that, the, messenger, bearing, it, did, indeed, also, carry, a, genuine, message, from, the, intended, person, a, literary, or, artistic, symbol, as, an, outward, sign, of, something, else, is, a, metaphorical, extension, of, this, notion, of, a, message, from, a, sender, to, a, recipient, in, english, the, meaning, something, which, stands, for, something, else, was, first, recorded, in, 1590, in, edmund, spenser, s, faerie, queene, symbols, are, a, means, of, complex, communication, that, often, can, have, multiple, levels, of, meaning, symbols, are, the, basis, of, all, human, understanding, and, serve, as, vehicles, of, conception, for, all, human, knowledge, symbols, facilitate, understanding, of, the, world, in, which, we, live, thus, serving, as, the, grounds, upon, which, we, make, judgments, in, this, way, people, use, symbols, not, only, to, make, sense, of, the, world, around, them, but, also, to, identify, and, cooperate, in, society, through, constitutive, rhetoric, human, cultures, use, symbols, to, express, specific, ideologies, and, social, structures, and, to, represent, aspects, of, their, specific, culture, thus, symbols, carry, meanings, that, depend, upon, one, s, cultural, background, as, a, result, the, meaning, of, a, symbol, is, not, inherent, in, the, symbol, itself, but, is, culturally, learned, heinrich, zimmer, gives, a, concise, overview, of, the, nature, and, perennial, relevance, of, symbols, concepts, and, words, are, symbols, just, as, visions, rituals, and, images, are, so, too, are, the, manners, and, customs, of, daily, life, through, all, of, these, a, transcendent, reality, is, mirrored, there, are, so, many, metaphors, reflecting, and, implying, something, which, though, thus, variously, expressed, is, ineffable, though, thus, rendered, multiform, remains, inscrutable, symbols, hold, the, mind, to, truth, but, are, not, themselves, the, truth, hence, it, is, delusory, to, borrow, them, each, civilisation, every, age, must, bring, forth, its, own, in, the, book, signs, and, symbols, it, is, stated, that, a, symbol, is, a, visual, image, or, sign, representing, an, idea, a, deeper, indicator, of, universal, truth, semiotics, is, the, study, of, signs, symbols, and, signification, as, communicative, behavior, semiotics, studies, focus, on, the, relationship, of, the, signifier, and, the, signified, also, taking, into, account, the, interpretation, of, visual, cues, body, language, sound, and, other, contextual, clues, semiotics, is, linked, with, linguistics, and, psychology, semioticians, not, only, study, what, a, symbol, implies, but, also, how, it, got, its, meaning, and, how, it, functions, to, make, meaning, in, society, for, example, symbols, can, cause, confusion, in, translation, when, the, same, symbol, mean, different, things, in, the, source, and, target, languages, a, potential, error, documented, in, survey, translation, is, the, symbol, of, x, used, to, denote, yes, when, marking, a, response, in, the, english, language, surveys, but, x, usually, means, no, in, the, chinese, convention, symbols, allow, the, human, brain, continuously, to, create, meaning, using, sensory, input, and, decode, symbols, through, both, denotation, and, connotation, an, alternative, definition, of, symbol, distinguishing, it, from, the, term, sign, was, proposed, by, swiss, psychoanalyst, carl, jung, in, his, studies, on, what, is, now, called, jungian, archetypes, a, sign, stands, for, something, known, as, a, word, stands, for, its, referent, he, contrasted, a, sign, with, a, symbol, something, that, is, unknown, and, that, cannot, be, made, clear, or, precise, an, example, of, a, symbol, in, this, sense, is, christ, as, a, symbol, of, the, archetype, called, self, kenneth, burke, described, homo, sapiens, as, a, symbol, using, symbol, making, and, symbol, misusing, animal, to, suggest, that, a, person, creates, symbols, as, well, as, misuses, them, one, example, he, uses, to, indicate, what, he, means, by, the, misuse, of, symbol, is, the, story, of, a, man, who, when, told, that, a, particular, food, item, was, whale, blubber, could, barely, keep, from, throwing, it, up, later, his, friend, discovered, it, was, actually, just, a, dumpling, but, the, man, s, reaction, was, a, direct, consequence, of, the, symbol, of, blubber, representing, something, inedible, in, his, mind, in, addition, the, symbol, of, blubber, was, created, by, the, man, through, various, kinds, of, learning, burke, goes, on, to, describe, symbols, as, also, being, derived, from, sigmund, freud, s, work, on, condensation, and, displacement, further, stating, that, symbols, are, not, just, relevant, to, the, theory, of, dreams, but, also, to, normal, symbol, systems, he, says, they, are, related, through, substitution, where, one, word, phrase, or, symbol, is, substituted, for, another, in, order, to, change, the, meaning, in, other, words, if, one, person, does, not, understand, a, certain, word, or, phrase, another, person, may, substitute, a, synonym, or, symbol, in, order, to, get, the, meaning, across, however, upon, learning, the, new, way, of, interpreting, a, specific, symbol, the, person, may, change, his, or, her, already, formed, ideas, to, incorporate, the, new, information, jean, dalby, clift, says, that, people, not, only, add, their, own, interpretations, to, symbols, they, also, create, personal, symbols, that, represent, their, own, understanding, of, their, lives, what, she, calls, core, images, of, the, person, clift, argues, that, symbolic, work, with, these, personal, symbols, or, core, images, can, be, as, useful, as, working, with, dream, symbols, in, psychoanalysis, or, counseling, william, indick, suggests, that, the, symbols, that, are, commonly, found, in, myth, legend, and, fantasy, fulfill, psychological, functions, and, hence, are, why, archetypes, such, as, the, hero, the, princess, and, the, witch, have, remained, popular, for, centuries, symbols, can, carry, symbolic, value, in, three, primary, forms, ideological, comparative, and, isomorphic, ideological, symbols, such, as, religious, and, state, symbols, convey, complex, sets, of, beliefs, and, ideas, that, indicate, the, right, thing, to, do, comparative, symbols, such, as, prestigious, office, addresses, fine, art, and, prominent, awards, indicate, answers, to, questions, of, better, or, worse, and, superior, or, inferior, isomorphic, symbols, blend, in, with, the, surrounding, cultural, environment, such, that, they, enable, individuals, and, organizations, to, conform, to, their, surroundings, and, evade, social, and, political, scrutiny, examples, of, symbols, with, isomorphic, value, include, wearing, a, professional, dress, during, business, meetings, shaking, hands, to, greet, others, in, the, west, or, bowing, to, greet, others, in, the, east, a, single, symbol, can, carry, multiple, distinct, meanings, such, that, it, provides, multiple, types, of, symbolic, value, paul, tillich, argued, that, while, signs, are, invented, and, forgotten, symbols, are, born, and, die, there, are, therefore, dead, and, living, symbols, a, living, symbol, can, reveal, to, an, individual, hidden, levels, of, meaning, and, transcendent, or, religious, realities, for, tillich, a, symbol, always, points, beyond, itself, to, something, that, is, unquantifiable, and, mysterious, symbols, open, up, the, depth, dimension, of, reality, itself, symbols, are, complex, and, their, meanings, can, evolve, as, the, individual, or, culture, evolves, when, a, symbol, loses, its, meaning, and, power, for, an, individual, or, culture, it, becomes, a, dead, symbol, when, a, symbol, becomes, identified, with, the, deeper, reality, to, which, it, refers, it, becomes, idolatrous, as, the, symbol, is, taken, for, reality, the, symbol, itself, is, substituted, for, the, deeper, meaning, it, intends, to, convey, the, unique, nature, of, a, symbol, is, that, it, gives, access, to, deeper, layers, of, reality, which, are, otherwise, inaccessible, a, symbol, s, meaning, may, be, modified, by, various, factors, including, popular, usage, history, and, contextual, intent, the, history, of, a, symbol, is, one, of, many, factors, in, determining, a, particular, symbol, s, apparent, meaning, consequently, symbols, with, emotive, power, carry, problems, analogous, to, false, etymologies, the, context, of, a, symbol, may, change, its, meaning, similar, five, pointed, stars, might, signify, a, law, enforcement, officer, or, a, member, of, the, armed, services, depending, upon, the, uniform, symbols, are, used, in, cartography, to, communicate, geographical, information, generally, as, point, line, or, area, features, as, with, other, symbols, visual, variables, such, as, size, shape, orientation, texture, and, pattern, provide, meaning, to, the, symbol, according, to, semiotics, map, symbols, are, read, by, map, users, when, they, make, a, connection, between, the, graphic, mark, on, the, map, the, sign, a, general, concept, the, interpretant, and, a, particular, feature, of, the, real, world, the, referent, map, symbols, can, thus, be, categorized, by, how, they, suggest, this, connection, a, symbolic, action, is, an, action, that, symbolizes, or, signals, what, the, actor, wants, or, believes, the, action, conveys, meaning, to, the, viewers, symbolic, action, may, overlap, with, symbolic, speech, such, as, the, use, of, flag, burning, to, express, hostility, or, saluting, the, flag, to, express, patriotism, in, response, to, intense, public, criticism, businesses, organizations, and, governments, may, take, symbolic, actions, rather, than, or, in, addition, to, directly, addressing, the, identified, problems
