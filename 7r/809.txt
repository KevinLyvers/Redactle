disability, is, the, experience, of, any, condition, that, makes, it, more, difficult, for, a, person, to, do, certain, activities, or, have, equitable, access, within, a, given, society, disabilities, may, be, cognitive, developmental, intellectual, mental, physical, sensory, or, a, combination, of, multiple, factors, disabilities, can, be, present, from, birth, or, can, be, acquired, during, a, person, s, lifetime, historically, disabilities, have, only, been, recognized, based, on, a, narrow, set, of, criteria, however, disabilities, are, not, binary, and, can, be, present, in, unique, characteristics, depending, on, the, individual, a, disability, may, be, readily, visible, or, invisible, in, nature, the, united, nations, convention, on, the, rights, of, persons, with, disabilities, defines, disability, as, including, long, term, physical, mental, intellectual, or, sensory, impairments, which, in, interaction, with, various, barriers, may, hinder, full, and, effective, participation, in, society, on, an, equal, basis, with, others, disabilities, have, been, perceived, differently, throughout, history, through, a, variety, of, different, theoretical, lenses, there, are, two, main, models, that, attempt, to, explain, disability, in, our, society, the, medical, model, and, the, social, model, the, medical, model, serves, as, a, theoretical, framework, that, considers, disability, as, an, undesirable, medical, condition, that, requires, specialized, treatment, those, who, ascribe, to, the, medical, model, tend, to, focus, on, finding, the, root, causes, of, disabilities, as, well, as, any, cures, such, as, assistive, technology, the, social, model, centers, disability, as, a, societally, created, limitation, on, individuals, who, do, not, have, the, same, ability, as, the, majority, of, the, population, although, the, medical, model, and, social, model, are, the, most, common, frames, for, disability, there, are, a, multitude, of, other, models, that, theorize, disability, there, are, many, terms, that, explain, aspects, of, disability, while, some, terms, solely, exist, to, describe, phenomena, pertaining, to, disability, others, have, been, centered, around, stigmatizing, and, ostracizing, those, with, disabilities, some, terms, have, such, a, negative, connotation, that, they, are, considered, to, be, slurs, a, current, point, of, contention, is, whether, it, is, appropriate, to, use, person, first, language, i, e, a, person, who, is, disabled, or, identity, first, language, i, e, a, disabled, person, when, referring, to, disability, and, an, individual, due, to, the, marginalization, of, disabled, people, there, have, been, several, activist, causes, that, push, for, equitable, treatment, and, access, in, society, disability, activists, have, fought, to, receive, equal, and, equitable, rights, under, the, law, though, there, are, still, political, issues, that, enable, or, advance, the, oppression, of, disabled, people, although, disability, activism, serves, to, dismantle, ableist, systems, social, norms, relating, to, the, perception, of, disabilities, are, often, reinforced, by, tropes, used, by, the, media, since, negative, perceptions, of, disability, are, pervasive, in, modern, society, disabled, people, have, turned, to, self, advocacy, in, an, attempt, to, push, back, against, their, marginalization, the, recognition, of, disability, as, an, identity, that, is, experienced, differently, based, on, the, other, multi, faceted, identities, of, the, individual, is, one, often, pointed, out, by, disabled, self, advocates, the, ostracization, of, disability, from, mainstream, society, has, created, the, opportunity, for, a, disability, culture, to, emerge, while, disabled, activists, still, promote, the, integration, of, disabled, people, into, mainstream, society, several, disabled, only, spaces, have, been, created, to, foster, a, disability, community, such, as, with, art, social, media, and, sports, contemporary, understandings, of, disability, derive, from, concepts, that, arose, during, the, scientific, enlightenment, in, the, west, prior, to, the, enlightenment, physical, differences, were, viewed, through, a, different, lens, there, is, evidence, of, humans, during, prehistory, that, looked, after, people, with, disabilities, at, the, windover, archeological, site, one, of, the, skeletons, was, a, male, about, 15, years, old, who, had, spina, bifida, the, condition, meant, that, the, boy, probably, paralyzed, below, the, waist, was, taken, care, of, in, a, hunter, gatherer, community, disability, was, not, viewed, as, a, means, of, divine, punishment, and, therefore, disabled, individuals, were, neither, exterminated, nor, discriminated, against, for, their, impairments, many, were, instead, employed, in, different, levels, of, mesopotamian, society, including, working, in, religious, temples, as, servants, of, the, gods, in, ancient, egypt, staffs, were, frequently, used, in, society, a, common, usage, for, them, was, for, older, persons, with, disabilities, to, help, them, walk, provisions, that, enabled, individuals, with, impaired, mobility, to, access, temples, and, healing, sanctuaries, were, made, in, ancient, greece, specifically, by, 370, b, c, at, the, most, important, healing, sanctuary, in, the, wider, area, the, sanctuary, of, asclepius, at, epidaurus, there, were, at, least, 11, permanent, stone, ramps, that, provided, access, to, mobility, impaired, visitors, to, nine, different, structures, evidence, that, people, with, disabilities, were, acknowledged, and, cared, for, at, least, partly, in, ancient, greece, in, fact, the, ancient, greeks, may, not, have, viewed, persons, with, disability, all, that, differently, from, more, able, bodied, individuals, as, terms, describing, them, in, their, records, appear, to, be, very, vague, as, long, as, the, disabled, person, in, question, could, still, contribute, to, society, the, greeks, appeared, to, tolerate, them, during, the, middle, ages, madness, and, other, conditions, were, thought, to, be, caused, by, demons, they, were, also, thought, to, be, part, of, the, natural, order, especially, during, and, in, the, fallout, of, the, black, death, which, wrought, impairments, throughout, the, general, population, in, the, early, modern, period, there, was, a, shift, to, seeking, biological, causes, for, physical, and, mental, differences, as, well, as, heightened, interest, in, demarcating, categories, for, example, ambroise, pare, in, the, sixteenth, century, wrote, of, monsters, prodigies, and, the, maimed, the, european, enlightenment, s, emphases, on, knowledge, derived, from, reason, and, on, the, value, of, natural, science, to, human, progress, helped, spawn, the, birth, of, institutions, and, associated, knowledge, systems, that, observed, and, categorized, human, beings, among, these, the, ones, significant, to, the, development, of, today, s, concepts, of, disability, were, asylums, clinics, and, prisons, contemporary, concepts, of, disability, are, rooted, in, eighteenth, and, nineteenth, century, developments, foremost, among, these, was, the, development, of, clinical, medical, discourse, which, made, the, human, body, visible, as, a, thing, to, be, manipulated, studied, and, transformed, these, worked, in, tandem, with, scientific, discourses, that, sought, to, classify, and, categorize, and, in, so, doing, became, methods, of, normalization, the, concept, of, the, norm, developed, in, this, time, period, and, is, signaled, in, the, work, of, the, belgian, statistician, sociologist, mathematician, and, astronomer, adolphe, quetelet, who, wrote, in, the, 1830s, of, l, homme, moyen, the, average, man, quetelet, postulated, that, one, could, take, the, sum, of, all, people, s, attributes, in, a, given, population, such, as, their, height, or, weight, and, find, their, average, and, that, this, figure, should, serve, as, a, statistical, norm, toward, which, all, should, aspire, this, idea, of, the, statistical, norm, threads, through, the, rapid, take, up, of, statistics, gathering, by, britain, the, united, states, and, the, western, european, states, during, this, time, period, and, it, is, tied, to, the, rise, of, eugenics, disability, as, well, as, the, concepts, of, abnormal, non, normal, and, normalcy, came, from, this, the, circulation, of, these, concepts, is, evident, in, the, popularity, of, the, freak, show, where, showmen, profited, from, exhibiting, people, who, deviated, from, those, norms, with, the, rise, of, eugenics, in, the, latter, part, of, the, nineteenth, century, such, deviations, were, viewed, as, dangerous, to, the, health, of, entire, populations, with, disability, viewed, as, part, of, a, person, s, biological, make, up, and, thus, their, genetic, inheritance, scientists, turned, their, attention, to, notions, of, weeding, such, as, deviations, out, of, the, gene, pool, various, metrics, for, assessing, a, person, s, genetic, fitness, were, determined, and, were, then, used, to, deport, sterilize, or, institutionalize, those, deemed, unfit, people, with, disabilities, were, one, of, the, groups, targeted, by, the, nazi, regime, in, germany, resulting, in, approximately, 250, 000, disabled, people, being, killed, during, the, holocaust, at, the, end, of, the, second, world, war, with, the, example, of, nazi, eugenics, eugenics, faded, from, public, discourse, and, increasingly, disability, cohered, into, a, set, of, attributes, that, medicine, could, attend, to, whether, through, augmentation, rehabilitation, or, treatment, in, both, contemporary, and, modern, history, disability, was, often, viewed, as, a, by, product, of, incest, between, first, degree, relatives, or, second, degree, relatives, disability, scholars, have, also, pointed, to, the, industrial, revolution, along, with, the, economic, shift, from, feudalism, to, capitalism, as, prominent, historical, moments, in, the, understanding, of, disability, although, there, was, a, certain, amount, of, religious, superstition, surrounding, disability, during, the, middle, ages, disabled, people, were, still, able, to, play, significant, roles, in, the, rural, production, based, economy, allowing, them, to, make, genuine, contributions, to, daily, economic, life, the, industrial, revolution, and, the, advent, of, capitalism, made, it, so, that, people, were, no, longer, tied, to, the, land, and, were, then, forced, to, find, work, that, would, pay, a, wage, in, order, to, survive, the, wage, system, in, combination, with, industrialized, production, transformed, the, way, bodies, were, viewed, as, people, were, increasingly, valued, for, their, ability, to, produce, like, machines, capitalism, and, the, industrial, revolution, effectively, solidified, this, class, of, disabled, people, who, could, not, conform, to, the, standard, worker, s, body, or, level, of, work, power, as, a, result, disabled, people, came, to, be, regarded, as, a, problem, to, be, solved, or, erased, in, the, early, 1970s, the, disability, rights, movement, became, established, when, disability, activists, began, to, challenge, how, society, treated, disabled, people, and, the, medical, approach, to, disability, due, to, this, work, physical, barriers, to, access, were, identified, these, conditions, functionally, disabled, them, and, what, is, now, known, as, the, social, model, of, disability, emerged, coined, by, mike, oliver, in, 1983, this, phrase, distinguishes, between, the, medical, model, of, disability, under, which, an, impairment, needs, to, be, fixed, and, the, social, model, of, disability, under, which, the, society, that, limits, a, person, needs, to, be, fixed, like, many, social, categories, the, concept, of, disability, is, under, heavy, discussion, amongst, academia, the, medical, and, legal, worlds, and, the, disability, community, the, academic, discipline, focused, on, theorizing, disability, is, disability, studies, which, has, been, expanding, since, the, late, twentieth, century, the, field, investigates, the, past, present, and, future, constructions, of, disability, along, with, advancing, the, viewpoint, that, disability, is, a, complex, social, identity, from, which, we, can, all, gain, insight, as, disabilities, scholar, claire, mullaney, puts, it, at, its, broadest, disability, studies, encourages, scholars, to, value, disability, as, a, form, of, cultural, difference, scholars, of, the, field, focus, on, a, range, of, disability, related, topics, such, as, ethics, policy, and, legislation, history, art, of, the, disability, community, and, more, notable, scholars, from, the, field, include, marta, russell, robert, mcruer, johanna, hedva, laura, hershey, irving, zola, and, many, more, prominent, disability, scholar, lennard, j, davis, notes, that, disability, studies, should, not, be, considered, a, niche, or, specialized, discipline, but, instead, is, applicable, to, a, wide, range, of, fields, and, topics, the, international, classification, of, functioning, disability, and, health, icf, produced, by, the, world, health, organization, distinguishes, between, body, functions, physiological, or, psychological, such, as, vision, and, body, structures, anatomical, parts, such, as, the, eye, and, related, structures, impairment, in, bodily, structure, or, function, is, defined, as, involving, an, anomaly, defect, loss, or, other, significant, deviation, from, certain, generally, accepted, population, standards, which, may, fluctuate, over, time, activity, is, defined, as, the, execution, of, a, task, or, action, the, icf, lists, nine, broad, domains, of, functioning, which, can, be, affected, in, concert, with, disability, scholars, the, introduction, to, the, icf, states, that, a, variety, of, conceptual, models, have, been, proposed, to, understand, and, explain, disability, and, functioning, which, it, seeks, to, integrate, these, models, include, the, following, the, medical, model, views, disability, as, a, problem, of, the, person, directly, caused, by, disease, trauma, or, other, health, conditions, which, therefore, requires, sustained, medical, care, in, the, form, of, individual, treatment, by, professionals, in, the, medical, model, management, of, the, disability, is, aimed, at, a, cure, or, the, individual, s, adjustment, and, behavioral, change, that, would, lead, to, an, almost, cure, or, effective, cure, the, individual, in, this, case, must, overcome, their, disability, by, medical, care, in, the, medical, model, medical, care, is, viewed, as, the, main, issue, and, at, the, political, level, the, principal, response, is, that, of, modifying, or, reforming, healthcare, policy, the, medical, model, focuses, on, finding, causes, and, cures, for, disabilities, there, are, many, causes, of, disability, that, often, affect, basic, activities, of, daily, living, such, as, eating, dressing, transferring, and, maintaining, personal, hygiene, or, advanced, activities, of, daily, living, such, as, shopping, food, preparation, driving, or, working, however, causes, of, disability, are, usually, determined, by, a, person, s, capability, to, perform, the, activities, of, daily, life, as, marta, russell, and, ravi, malhotra, argue, the, medicalization, of, disablement, and, the, tools, of, classification, clearly, played, an, important, role, in, establishing, divisions, between, the, disabled, and, the, able, bodied, this, positions, disability, as, a, problem, to, be, solved, via, medical, intervention, which, hinders, our, understanding, about, what, disability, can, mean, for, the, purposes, of, the, americans, with, disabilities, act, of, 1990, the, us, equal, employment, opportunity, commission, regulations, provide, a, list, of, conditions, that, should, easily, be, concluded, to, be, disabilities, amputation, attention, deficit, hyperactivity, disorder, adhd, autism, bipolar, disorder, blindness, cancer, cerebral, palsy, deafness, diabetes, epilepsy, hiv, aids, intellectual, disability, major, depressive, disorder, mobility, impairments, requiring, a, wheelchair, multiple, sclerosis, muscular, dystrophy, obsessive, compulsive, disorder, ocd, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, ptsd, spina, bifida, and, schizophrenia, this, is, not, an, exhaustive, list, and, many, injuries, and, medical, problems, cause, disability, some, causes, of, disability, such, as, injuries, may, resolve, over, time, and, are, considered, temporary, disabilities, an, acquired, disability, is, the, result, of, impairments, that, occur, suddenly, or, chronically, during, the, lifespan, as, opposed, to, being, born, with, the, impairment, invisible, disabilities, may, not, be, obviously, noticeable, the, medical, model, focuses, heavily, on, finding, treatments, cures, or, rehabilitative, practices, for, disabled, people, assistive, technology, is, a, generic, term, for, devices, and, modifications, for, a, person, or, within, a, society, that, help, overcome, or, remove, a, disability, the, first, recorded, example, of, the, use, of, a, prosthesis, dates, to, at, least, 1800, bc, the, wheelchair, dates, from, the, 17th, century, the, curb, cut, is, a, related, structural, innovation, other, examples, are, standing, frames, text, telephones, accessible, keyboards, large, print, braille, and, speech, recognition, software, disabled, people, often, develop, adaptations, which, can, be, personal, e, g, strategies, to, suppress, tics, in, public, or, community, e, g, sign, language, in, d, deaf, communities, as, the, personal, computer, has, become, more, ubiquitous, various, organizations, have, formed, to, develop, software, and, hardware, to, make, computers, more, accessible, for, disabled, people, some, software, and, hardware, such, as, voice, finger, freedom, scientific, s, jaws, the, free, and, open, source, alternative, orca, etc, have, been, specifically, designed, for, disabled, people, while, other, software, and, hardware, such, as, nuance, s, dragon, naturallyspeaking, were, not, developed, specifically, for, disabled, people, but, can, be, used, to, increase, accessibility, the, lomak, keyboard, was, designed, in, new, zealand, specifically, for, persons, with, disabilities, the, world, wide, web, consortium, recognized, a, need, for, international, standards, for, web, accessibility, for, persons, with, disabilities, and, created, the, web, accessibility, initiative, wai, as, at, dec, 2012, the, standard, is, wcag, 2, 0, wcag, web, content, accessibility, guidelines, the, social, model, of, disability, sees, disability, as, a, socially, created, problem, and, a, matter, of, the, full, integration, of, individuals, into, society, in, this, model, disability, is, not, an, attribute, of, an, individual, but, rather, a, complex, collection, of, conditions, created, by, the, social, environment, the, management, of, the, problem, requires, social, action, and, it, is, the, collective, responsibility, of, society, to, create, a, society, in, which, limitations, for, disabled, people, are, minimal, disability, is, both, cultural, and, ideological, in, creation, according, to, the, social, model, equal, access, for, someone, with, an, impairment, disability, is, a, human, rights, concern, the, social, model, of, disability, has, come, under, criticism, while, recognizing, the, importance, played, by, the, social, model, in, stressing, the, responsibility, of, society, scholars, including, tom, shakespeare, point, out, the, limits, of, the, model, and, urge, the, need, for, a, new, model, that, will, overcome, the, medical, vs, social, dichotomy, the, limitations, of, this, model, mean, that, often, the, vital, services, and, information, persons, with, disabilities, face, are, simply, not, available, often, due, to, limited, economic, returns, in, supporting, them, some, say, medical, humanities, is, a, fruitful, field, where, the, gap, between, the, medical, and, the, social, model, of, disability, might, be, bridged, the, social, construction, of, disability, is, the, idea, that, disability, is, constructed, by, social, expectations, and, institutions, rather, than, biological, differences, highlighting, the, ways, society, and, institutions, construct, disability, is, one, of, the, main, focuses, of, this, idea, in, the, same, way, that, race, and, gender, are, not, biologically, fixed, neither, is, disability, around, the, early, 1970s, sociologists, notably, eliot, friedson, began, to, argue, that, labeling, theory, and, social, deviance, could, be, applied, to, disability, studies, this, led, to, the, creation, of, the, social, construction, of, disability, theory, the, social, construction, of, disability, is, the, idea, that, disability, is, constructed, as, the, social, response, to, a, deviance, from, the, norm, the, medical, industry, is, the, creator, of, the, ill, and, disabled, social, role, medical, professionals, and, institutions, who, wield, expertise, over, health, have, the, ability, to, define, health, and, physical, and, mental, norms, when, an, individual, has, a, feature, that, creates, an, impairment, restriction, or, limitation, from, reaching, the, social, definition, of, health, the, individual, is, labeled, as, disabled, under, this, idea, disability, is, not, defined, by, the, physical, features, of, the, body, but, by, a, deviance, from, the, social, convention, of, health, the, social, construction, of, disability, would, argue, that, the, medical, model, of, disability, s, view, that, a, disability, is, an, impairment, restriction, or, limitation, is, wrong, instead, what, is, seen, as, a, disability, is, just, a, difference, in, the, individual, from, what, is, considered, normal, in, society, people, first, language, is, one, way, to, talk, about, disability, which, some, people, prefer, using, people, first, language, is, said, to, put, the, person, before, the, disability, those, individuals, who, prefer, people, first, language, would, prefer, to, be, called, a, person, with, a, disability, this, style, is, reflected, in, major, legislation, on, disability, rights, including, the, americans, with, disabilities, act, and, the, un, convention, on, the, rights, of, persons, with, disabilities, cerebral, palsy, a, guide, for, care, at, the, university, of, delaware, describes, people, first, language, the, american, psychological, association, style, guide, states, that, when, identifying, a, person, with, a, disability, the, person, s, name, or, pronoun, should, come, first, and, descriptions, of, the, disability, should, be, used, so, that, the, disability, is, identified, but, is, not, modifying, the, person, acceptable, examples, included, a, woman, with, down, syndrome, or, a, man, who, has, schizophrenia, it, also, states, that, a, person, s, adaptive, equipment, should, be, described, functionally, as, something, that, assists, a, person, not, as, something, that, limits, a, person, for, example, a, woman, who, uses, a, wheelchair, rather, than, a, woman, in, confined, to, a, wheelchair, people, first, terminology, is, used, in, the, uk, in, the, form, people, with, impairments, such, as, people, with, visual, impairments, however, in, the, uk, identity, first, language, is, generally, preferred, over, people, first, language, the, use, of, people, first, terminology, has, given, rise, to, the, use, of, the, acronym, pwd, to, refer, to, person, s, or, people, with, disabilities, or, disability, however, other, individuals, and, groups, prefer, identity, first, language, to, emphasize, how, a, disability, can, impact, people, s, identities, which, style, of, language, used, varies, between, different, countries, groups, and, individuals, identity, first, language, describes, the, person, as, disabled, some, people, prefer, this, and, argue, that, this, fits, the, social, model, of, disability, better, than, people, first, language, as, it, emphasizes, that, the, person, is, disabled, not, by, their, body, but, by, a, world, that, does, not, accommodate, them, this, is, especially, true, in, the, uk, where, it, is, argued, under, the, social, model, that, while, someone, s, impairment, for, example, having, a, spinal, cord, injury, is, an, individual, property, disability, is, something, created, by, external, societal, factors, such, as, a, lack, of, accessibility, this, distinction, between, the, individual, property, of, impairment, and, the, social, property, of, disability, is, central, to, the, social, model, the, term, disabled, people, as, a, political, construction, is, also, widely, used, by, international, organizations, of, disabled, people, such, as, disabled, peoples, international, using, the, identity, first, language, also, parallels, how, people, talk, about, other, aspects, of, identity, and, diversity, for, example, in, the, autism, community, many, self, advocates, and, their, allies, prefer, terminology, such, as, autistic, autistic, person, or, autistic, individual, because, we, understand, autism, as, an, inherent, part, of, an, individual, s, identity, the, same, way, one, refers, to, muslims, african, americans, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, chinese, gifted, athletic, or, jewish, similarly, deaf, communities, in, the, u, s, reject, people, first, language, in, favor, of, identity, first, language, in, 2021, the, us, association, on, higher, education, and, disability, ahead, announced, their, decision, to, use, identity, first, language, in, their, materials, explaining, identity, first, language, challenges, negative, connotations, by, claiming, disability, directly, identity, first, language, references, the, variety, that, exists, in, how, our, bodies, and, brains, work, with, a, myriad, of, conditions, that, exist, and, the, role, of, inaccessible, or, oppressive, systems, structures, or, environments, in, making, someone, disabled, invisible, disabilities, also, known, as, hidden, disabilities, or, non, visible, disabilities, nvd, are, disabilities, that, are, not, immediately, apparent, or, seeable, they, are, often, chronic, illnesses, and, conditions, that, significantly, impair, normal, activities, of, daily, living, invisible, disabilities, can, hinder, a, person, s, efforts, to, go, to, school, work, socialize, and, more, some, examples, of, invisible, disabilities, include, intellectual, disabilities, autism, spectrum, disorder, attention, deficit, hyperactivity, disorder, fibromyalgia, mental, disorders, asthma, epilepsy, allergies, migraines, arthritis, and, chronic, fatigue, syndrome, employment, discrimination, is, reported, to, play, a, significant, part, in, the, high, rate, of, unemployment, among, those, with, a, diagnosis, of, mental, illness, people, with, health, conditions, such, as, arthritis, bipolar, disorder, hiv, or, multiple, sclerosis, may, have, periods, of, wellness, between, episodes, of, illness, during, the, illness, episodes, people, s, ability, to, perform, normal, tasks, such, as, work, can, be, intermittent, disability, activism, itself, has, led, to, the, revision, of, appropriate, language, when, discussing, disability, and, disabled, people, for, example, the, medical, classification, of, retarded, has, since, been, disregarded, due, to, its, negative, implications, moreover, disability, activism, has, also, led, to, pejorative, language, being, reclaimed, by, disabled, people, mairs, 1986, explained, how, disabled, people, may, choose, to, self, describe, themselves, as, a, cripple, this, may, appear, surprising, that, they, are, using, stereotypically, negative, language, associated, with, disability, to, describe, themselves, however, the, purpose, is, to, reclaim, the, disabled, identity, from, medical, professionals, and, realign, it, with, the, preferred, language, of, disabled, people, the, reclamation, of, language, demonstrated, above, positions, itself, within, the, social, model, as, it, highlights, how, as, a, society, we, construct, concepts, and, perceptions, of, disability, disability, activists, have, drawn, attention, to, the, following, issues, the, disability, rights, movement, aims, to, secure, equal, opportunities, and, equal, rights, for, disabled, people, the, specific, goals, and, demands, of, the, movement, are, accessibility, and, safety, in, transportation, architecture, and, the, physical, environment, equal, opportunities, in, independent, living, employment, education, and, housing, and, freedom, from, abuse, neglect, and, violations, of, patients, rights, effective, civil, rights, legislation, is, sought, to, secure, these, opportunities, and, rights, the, early, disability, rights, movement, was, dominated, by, the, medical, model, of, disability, where, emphasis, was, placed, on, curing, or, treating, disabled, people, so, that, they, would, adhere, to, the, social, norm, but, starting, in, the, 1960s, rights, groups, began, shifting, to, the, social, model, of, disability, where, disability, is, interpreted, as, an, issue, of, discrimination, thereby, paving, the, way, for, rights, groups, to, achieve, equality, through, legal, means, advocacy, for, disability, issues, and, accessibility, in, the, republics, of, the, former, soviet, union, has, become, more, organized, and, influential, in, policymaking, evolving, from, the, disability, rights, movement, is, the, disability, justice, movement, which, aims, to, improve, the, lives, of, disabled, people, through, prioritizing, collective, liberation, as, opposed, to, prioritizing, legislative, change, and, traditional, civil, rights, this, framework, dubbed, the, second, wave, of, disability, rights, seeks, to, examine, the, many, systems, of, oppression, that, are, intertwined, with, ableism, such, colonialism, white, supremacy, and, heteropatriarchal, capitalism, the, term, disability, justice, was, coined, in, 2005, by, lgbtq, disabled, women, of, color, mia, mingus, patricia, berne, and, stacey, milbern, who, sought, to, build, an, anti, ableist, movement, with, a, larger, emphasis, on, intersectionality, than, mainstream, disability, rights, as, to, center, marginalized, voices, their, group, the, disability, justice, collective, also, included, notable, disability, activists, such, as, sebastian, margaret, leroy, f, moore, jr, well, known, for, his, poetry, and, founding, of, the, krip, hop, movement, and, eli, clare, well, known, for, popularizing, the, bodymind, concept, within, disability, studies, on, december, 13, 2006, the, united, nations, formally, agreed, on, the, convention, on, the, rights, of, persons, with, disabilities, the, first, human, rights, treaty, of, the, 21st, century, to, protect, and, enhance, the, rights, and, opportunities, of, the, world, s, estimated, 650, million, disabled, people, as, of, january, 2021, 182, nations, have, ratified, or, accepted, accession, to, the, convention, countries, that, sign, the, convention, are, required, to, adopt, national, laws, and, remove, old, ones, so, that, persons, with, disabilities, will, for, example, have, equal, rights, to, education, employment, and, cultural, life, to, the, right, to, own, and, inherit, property, to, not, be, discriminated, against, in, marriage, etc, and, to, not, be, unwilling, subjects, in, medical, experiments, un, officials, including, the, high, commissioner, for, human, rights, have, characterized, the, bill, as, representing, a, paradigm, shift, in, attitudes, toward, a, more, rights, based, view, of, disability, in, line, with, the, social, model, in, 1976, the, united, nations, began, planning, for, its, international, year, for, disabled, persons, 1981, later, renamed, the, international, year, of, disabled, persons, some, disability, activists, used, the, year, to, highlight, various, injustices, such, as, in, australia, where, beauty, pageants, were, targeted, in, order, to, in, the, words, of, activist, leslie, hall, challenge, the, notion, of, beauty, and, reject, the, charity, ethic, the, un, decade, of, disabled, persons, 1983, 1993, featured, a, world, programme, of, action, concerning, disabled, persons, in, 1979, frank, bowe, was, the, only, person, with, a, disability, representing, any, country, in, the, planning, of, iydp, 1981, today, many, countries, have, named, representatives, who, are, themselves, individuals, with, disabilities, the, decade, was, closed, in, an, address, before, the, general, assembly, by, robert, davila, both, bowe, and, davila, are, deaf, in, 1984, unesco, accepted, sign, language, for, use, in, the, education, of, deaf, children, and, youth, un, programs, and, osce, work, to, align, policy, and, programs, in, countries, that, were, part, of, the, former, soviet, union, with, the, convention, on, the, rights, of, persons, with, disabilities, political, rights, social, inclusion, and, citizenship, have, come, to, the, fore, in, developed, and, some, developing, countries, the, debate, has, some, instances, moved, beyond, a, concern, about, the, perceived, cost, of, maintaining, dependent, disabled, people, to, finding, effective, ways, to, ensure, that, disabled, people, can, participate, in, and, contribute, to, society, in, all, spheres, of, life, in, developing, nations, where, the, vast, bulk, of, the, estimated, 650, million, disabled, people, reside, a, great, deal, of, work, is, needed, to, address, concerns, ranging, from, accessibility, and, education, to, self, empowerment, self, supporting, employment, and, beyond, in, the, past, few, decades, the, efforts, of, disability, rights, activists, around, the, world, focused, on, obtaining, full, citizenship, for, disabled, people, have, come, under, academic, study, and, gained, some, level, of, public, recognition, in, many, places, such, as, in, the, united, states, there, are, obstacles, in, many, countries, in, getting, full, employment, and, public, perception, of, disabled, people, varies, disability, abuse, happens, when, a, person, is, abused, physically, financially, verbally, or, mentally, due, to, the, person, having, a, disability, as, many, disabilities, are, not, visible, for, example, asthma, learning, disabilities, some, abusers, cannot, rationalize, the, non, physical, disability, with, a, need, for, understanding, support, and, so, on, as, the, prevalence, of, disability, and, the, cost, of, supporting, disability, increases, with, medical, advancement, and, longevity, in, general, this, aspect, of, society, becomes, of, greater, political, importance, how, political, parties, treat, their, disabled, constituents, may, become, a, measure, of, a, political, party, s, understanding, of, disability, particularly, in, the, social, model, of, disability, disability, benefit, or, disability, pension, is, a, major, kind, of, disability, insurance, that, is, provided, by, government, agencies, to, people, who, are, temporarily, or, permanently, unable, to, work, due, to, a, disability, in, the, u, s, the, disability, benefit, is, provided, in, the, category, of, supplemental, security, income, in, canada, it, is, within, the, canada, pension, plan, following, a, long, nationwide, campaign, involving, hundreds, of, thousands, of, people, the, national, disability, insurance, scheme, was, introduced, in, australia, in, 2013, to, fund, a, number, of, supports, in, other, countries, disability, benefits, may, be, provided, under, social, security, systems, costs, of, disability, pensions, are, steadily, growing, in, western, countries, mainly, in, europe, and, the, united, states, it, was, reported, that, in, the, uk, expenditure, on, disability, pensions, accounted, for, 0, 9, of, gross, domestic, product, gdp, in, 1980, two, decades, later, it, had, reached, 2, 6, of, gdp, several, studies, have, reported, a, link, between, increased, absence, from, work, due, to, sickness, and, elevated, risk, of, future, disability, pension, a, study, by, researchers, in, denmark, suggests, that, information, on, self, reported, days, of, absence, due, to, sickness, can, be, used, to, effectively, identify, future, potential, groups, for, disability, pension, these, studies, may, provide, useful, information, for, policymakers, case, managing, authorities, employers, and, physicians, in, switzerland, social, policies, in, the, field, of, disability, have, been, significantly, reshaped, over, the, last, two, decades, by, reducing, the, number, of, allowances, awarded, and, by, increasing, the, recourse, to, vocational, rehabilitation, measures, drawing, on, interviews, conducted, with, individuals, who, have, been, involved, in, programs, set, up, by, swiss, disability, insurance, a, study, highlights, their, uncertainties, and, concerns, relating, to, their, place, in, society, as, well, as, their, reactions, to, disability, insurance, s, interventions, private, for, profit, disability, insurance, plays, a, role, in, providing, incomes, to, disabled, people, but, the, nationalized, programs, are, the, safety, net, that, catch, most, claimants, studies, have, illustrated, a, correlation, between, disability, and, poverty, notably, jobs, offered, to, disabled, people, are, scarce, marta, russell, notes, that, primary, basis, for, oppression, of, disabled, persons, those, who, could, work, with, accommodations, is, their, exclusion, from, exploitation, as, wage, laborers, many, countries, have, programs, which, aid, intellectually, disabled, id, people, to, acquire, skills, needed, in, the, workforce, such, programs, include, sheltered, workshops, and, adult, day, care, programs, sheltered, programs, consist, of, daytime, activities, such, as, gardening, manufacturing, and, assembling, these, activities, facilitate, routine, oriented, tasks, that, in, turn, allow, id, people, to, gain, experience, before, entering, the, workforce, similarly, adult, day, care, programs, also, include, day, time, activities, however, these, activities, are, based, in, an, educational, environment, where, id, people, are, able, to, engage, in, educational, physical, and, communication, based, tasks, which, helps, facilitate, communication, memory, and, general, living, skills, in, addition, adult, day, care, programs, arranged, community, activities, by, scheduling, field, trips, to, public, places, e, g, zoos, and, movie, theaters, despite, both, programs, providing, essential, skills, for, intellectually, disabled, people, prior, to, entering, the, workforce, researchers, have, found, that, id, people, prefer, to, be, involved, with, community, integrated, employment, community, integrated, employment, opportunities, are, offered, to, id, people, at, minimum, or, higher, wages, in, a, variety, of, occupations, ranging, from, customer, service, clerical, janitorial, hospitality, and, manufacturing, positions, id, employees, work, alongside, employees, without, disabilities, who, are, able, to, assist, them, with, training, all, three, options, allow, intellectually, disabled, people, to, develop, and, exercise, social, skills, that, are, vital, to, everyday, life, however, it, is, not, guaranteed, that, id, employees, receive, the, same, treatment, as, employees, without, id, according, to, lindstrom, et, al, community, integrated, employees, are, less, likely, to, receive, raises, and, only, 26, are, able, to, retain, full, time, status, finding, a, stable, workforce, poses, additional, challenges, a, study, published, in, the, journal, of, applied, research, in, intellectual, disability, indicated, that, although, finding, a, job, may, be, difficult, stabilizing, a, job, is, even, harder, chadsey, rusch, proposed, that, securing, employment, for, id, people, requires, adequate, production, skills, and, effective, social, skills, other, underlying, factors, for, job, loss, include, structural, factors, and, worker, workplace, integration, as, stated, by, kilsby, limited, structural, factors, can, affect, a, multitude, of, factors, in, a, job, such, as, a, restricted, number, of, hours, an, id, person, is, allowed, to, work, this, in, return, according, to, fabian, et, al, leads, to, a, lack, of, opportunity, to, develop, relationships, with, coworkers, or, to, better, integrate, within, the, workplace, nevertheless, those, who, are, unable, to, stabilize, a, job, often, are, left, discouraged, according, to, the, same, study, conducted, by, jarid, many, who, had, participated, found, that, they, had, made, smaller, incomes, when, compared, to, their, co, workers, had, an, excess, of, time, throughout, their, days, because, they, did, not, have, work, they, also, had, feelings, of, hopelessness, and, failure, according, to, the, u, s, national, organization, on, disability, not, only, do, id, people, face, constant, discouragement, but, many, live, below, the, poverty, line, because, they, are, unable, to, find, or, stabilize, employment, and, because, of, employee, restricting, factors, placed, on, id, workers, this, renders, id, people, unable, to, provide, for, themselves, including, basic, necessities, such, as, food, medical, care, transportation, and, housing, the, poverty, rate, for, working, age, people, with, disabilities, is, nearly, two, and, a, half, times, higher, than, that, for, people, without, disabilities, disability, and, poverty, may, form, a, vicious, circle, in, which, physical, barriers, and, stigma, of, disability, make, it, more, difficult, to, get, income, which, in, turn, diminishes, access, to, health, care, and, other, necessities, for, a, healthy, life, in, societies, without, state, funded, health, and, social, services, living, with, a, disability, could, require, spending, on, medication, and, frequent, health, care, visits, in, home, personal, assistance, and, adaptive, devices, and, clothing, along, with, the, usual, costs, of, living, the, world, report, on, disability, indicates, that, half, of, all, disabled, people, cannot, afford, health, care, compared, to, a, third, of, abled, people, in, countries, without, public, services, for, adults, with, disabilities, their, families, may, be, impoverished, there, is, limited, research, knowledge, but, many, anecdotal, reports, on, what, happens, when, disasters, impact, disabled, people, individuals, with, disabilities, are, greatly, affected, by, disasters, those, with, physical, disabilities, can, be, at, risk, when, evacuating, if, assistance, is, not, available, individuals, with, cognitive, impairments, may, struggle, with, understanding, instructions, that, must, be, followed, in, the, event, a, disaster, occurs, all, of, these, factors, can, increase, the, degree, of, variation, of, risk, in, disaster, situations, with, disabled, individuals, research, studies, have, consistently, found, discrimination, against, individuals, with, disabilities, during, all, phases, of, a, disaster, cycle, the, most, common, limitation, is, that, people, cannot, physically, access, buildings, or, transportation, as, well, as, access, disaster, related, services, the, exclusion, of, these, individuals, is, caused, in, part, by, the, lack, of, disability, related, training, provided, to, emergency, planners, and, disaster, relief, personnel, to, a, certain, degree, physical, impairments, and, changing, mental, states, are, almost, ubiquitously, experienced, by, people, as, they, age, aging, populations, are, often, stigmatized, for, having, a, high, prevalence, of, disability, kathleen, woodward, writing, in, key, words, for, disability, studies, explains, the, phenomenon, as, follows, aging, is, invoked, rhetorically, at, times, ominously, as, a, pressing, reason, why, disability, should, be, of, crucial, interest, to, all, of, us, we, are, all, getting, older, we, will, all, be, disabled, eventually, thereby, inadvertently, reinforcing, the, damaging, and, dominant, stereotype, of, aging, as, solely, an, experience, of, decline, and, deterioration, but, little, attention, has, been, given, to, the, imbrication, of, aging, and, disability, in, feminist, queer, crip, alison, kafer, mentions, aging, and, the, anxiety, associated, with, it, according, to, kafer, this, anxiety, stems, from, ideas, of, normalcy, she, says, anxiety, about, aging, for, example, can, be, seen, as, a, symptom, of, compulsory, able, bodiedness, able, mindedness, as, can, attempts, to, treat, children, who, are, slightly, shorter, than, average, with, growth, hormones, in, neither, case, are, the, people, involved, necessarily, disabled, but, they, are, certainly, affected, by, cultural, ideals, of, normalcy, and, ideal, form, and, function, in, contexts, where, their, differences, are, visible, persons, with, disabilities, often, face, stigma, people, frequently, react, to, disabled, presence, with, fear, pity, patronization, intrusive, gazes, revulsion, or, disregard, these, reactions, can, and, often, do, exclude, persons, with, disabilities, from, accessing, social, spaces, along, with, the, benefits, and, resources, these, spaces, provide, disabled, writer, researcher, jenny, morris, describes, how, stigma, functions, to, marginalize, persons, with, disabilities, going, out, in, public, so, often, takes, courage, how, many, of, us, find, that, we, can, t, dredge, up, the, strength, to, do, it, day, after, day, week, after, week, year, after, year, a, lifetime, of, rejection, and, revulsion, it, is, not, only, physical, limitations, that, restrict, us, to, our, homes, and, those, whom, we, know, it, is, the, knowledge, that, each, entry, into, the, public, world, will, be, dominated, by, stares, by, condescension, by, pity, and, by, hostility, additionally, facing, stigma, can, cause, harm, to, the, psycho, emotional, well, being, of, the, person, being, stigmatized, one, of, the, ways, in, which, the, psycho, emotional, health, of, persons, with, disabilities, is, adversely, affected, is, through, the, internalization, of, the, oppression, they, experience, which, can, lead, to, feeling, that, they, are, weak, crazy, worthless, or, any, number, of, other, negative, attributes, that, may, be, associated, with, their, conditions, internalization, of, oppression, damages, the, self, esteem, of, the, person, affected, and, shapes, their, behaviors, in, ways, that, are, compliant, with, dominance, of, those, with, no, acknowledged, disability, ableist, ideas, are, frequently, internalized, when, disabled, people, are, pressured, by, the, people, and, institutions, around, them, to, hide, and, downplay, their, disabled, difference, or, pass, according, to, writer, simi, linton, the, act, of, passing, takes, a, deep, emotional, toll, by, causing, disabled, individuals, to, experience, loss, of, community, anxiety, and, self, doubt, the, media, play, a, significant, role, in, creating, and, reinforcing, stigma, associated, with, disability, media, portrayals, of, disability, usually, cast, disabled, presence, as, necessarily, marginal, within, society, at, large, these, portrayals, simultaneously, reflect, and, influence, the, popular, perception, of, disabled, difference, there, are, distinct, tactics, that, the, media, frequently, employ, in, representing, disability, these, common, ways, of, framing, disability, are, heavily, criticized, for, being, dehumanizing, and, failing, to, place, importance, on, the, perspectives, of, persons, with, disabilities, as, outlined, by, disability, theorist, and, rhetorician, jay, timothy, dolmage, ableist, media, tropes, can, reflect, and, continue, to, perpetuate, societal, myths, about, disabled, people, inspiration, porn, refers, to, portrayals, of, persons, with, disabilities, in, which, they, are, presented, as, being, inspiring, simply, because, the, person, has, a, disability, these, portrayals, are, criticized, because, they, are, created, with, the, intent, of, making, viewers, with, no, acknowledged, disability, feel, better, about, themselves, in, comparison, to, the, individual, portrayed, rather, than, recognizing, the, humanity, of, persons, with, disabilities, inspiration, porn, turns, them, into, objects, of, inspiration, for, an, audience, composed, of, those, with, no, acknowledged, disability, the, supercrip, trope, refers, to, instances, when, the, media, reports, on, or, portray, a, disabled, person, who, has, made, a, noteworthy, achievement, but, centers, on, their, disability, rather, than, what, they, actually, did, they, are, portrayed, as, awe, inspiring, for, being, exceptional, compared, to, others, with, the, same, or, similar, conditions, this, trope, is, widely, used, in, reporting, on, disabled, athletes, as, well, as, in, portrayals, of, autistic, savants, these, representations, notes, disability, scholar, ria, cheyne, are, widely, assumed, to, be, inherently, regressive, reducing, people, to, their, condition, rather, than, viewing, them, as, full, people, furthermore, supercrip, portrayals, are, criticized, for, creating, the, unrealistic, expectation, that, disability, should, be, accompanied, by, some, type, of, special, talent, genius, or, insight, examples, of, this, trope, in, the, media, include, dr, shaun, murphy, from, the, good, doctor, marvel, s, daredevil, and, others, scholar, sami, schalk, argues, that, the, term, supercrip, has, a, narrow, definition, given, how, widely, used, the, term, is, as, a, result, schlak, provides, three, categories, of, supercrip, narratives, used, characters, in, fiction, that, bear, physical, or, mental, markers, of, difference, from, perceived, societal, norms, are, frequently, positioned, as, villains, within, a, text, lindsey, row, heyveld, shares, ways, students, should, be, taught, to, begin, to, further, analyze, this, issue, disabled, people, s, visible, differences, from, the, abled, majority, are, meant, to, evoke, fear, in, audiences, that, can, perpetuate, the, mindset, of, disabled, people, being, a, threat, to, individual, or, public, interests, and, well, being, the, disability, drop, trope, is, when, a, supposedly, disabled, character, is, revealed, to, have, been, faking, embellishing, or, otherwise, not, actually, embodying, their, claimed, disability, jay, dolmage, offers, kevin, spacey, s, character, verbal, kint, in, the, film, usual, suspects, as, an, example, of, this, and, depictions, like, this, can, reflect, able, bodied, society, s, mistrust, of, disabled, people, in, addition, this, reveal, of, a, character, s, nondisabledness, often, serves, as, the, narrative, climax, of, a, story, and, the, use, of, disability, as, a, source, of, conflict, in, the, plot, narrative, obstacle, or, a, device, of, characterization, aligns, with, other, disability, studies, scholars, theory, of, narrative, prosthesis, a, term, coined, by, david, t, mitchell, and, sharon, snyder, another, frequent, occurrence, is, when, someone, with, a, disability, is, assumed, to, be, miserable, or, helpless, the, hunchback, of, notre, dame, s, quasimodo, the, elephant, man, s, john, merrick, a, christmas, carol, s, tiny, tim, and, even, news, broadcasts, that, refer, to, people, as, victims, or, sufferers, are, a, few, examples, of, this, stereotype, characters, with, disabilities, are, frequently, portrayed, in, movies, as, being, angelic, or, childish, these, films, include, rain, man, 1988, forrest, gump, 1994, and, i, am, sam, 2001, all, of, which, are, excellent, examples, the, innocent, and, endearing, person, with, a, disability, often, points, out, the, inadequacies, of, their, normal, adult, peers, which, helps, them, achieve, salvation, like, all, the, others, this, stereotype, perpetuates, patronizing, perceptions, that, are, simply, untrue, and, are, therefore, damaging, while, there, are, many, disability, tropes, disability, aesthetics, attempts, to, dispel, them, by, accurately, depicting, disabled, bodies, in, art, and, media, some, disabled, people, have, attempted, to, resist, marginalization, through, the, use, of, the, social, model, in, opposition, to, the, medical, model, with, the, aim, of, shifting, criticism, away, from, their, bodies, and, impairments, and, towards, the, social, institutions, that, oppress, them, relative, to, their, abled, peers, disability, activism, that, demands, many, grievances, be, addressed, such, as, lack, of, accessibility, poor, representation, in, media, general, disrespect, and, lack, of, recognition, originates, from, a, social, model, framework, the, creation, of, disability, culture, stemmed, from, the, shared, experience, of, stigmatization, in, broader, society, embracing, disability, as, a, positive, identity, by, becoming, involved, in, disabled, communities, and, participating, in, disability, culture, can, be, an, effective, way, to, combat, internalized, prejudice, and, can, challenge, dominant, narratives, about, disability, the, experiences, that, disabled, people, have, to, navigate, social, institutions, vary, greatly, as, a, function, of, what, other, social, categories, they, may, belong, to, for, example, a, disabled, man, and, a, disabled, woman, experience, disability, differently, this, speaks, to, the, concept, of, intersectionality, which, explains, that, different, aspects, of, a, person, s, identity, such, as, their, gender, race, sexuality, religion, or, social, class, intersect, and, create, unique, experiences, of, oppression, and, privilege, the, united, nations, convention, on, the, rights, of, persons, with, disabilities, differentiates, between, a, few, kinds, of, disability, intersections, such, as, the, age, disability, race, disability, and, gender, disability, intersection, however, many, more, intersections, exist, disability, is, defined, differently, by, each, person, it, may, be, visible, or, invisible, and, multiple, intersections, often, arise, from, overlapping, identity, categories, incidence, of, disability, is, reported, to, be, greater, among, several, minority, communities, across, the, globe, according, to, a, systematic, analysis, of, the, global, burden, of, disease, study, disabled, people, who, are, also, racial, minorities, generally, have, less, access, to, support, and, are, more, vulnerable, to, violent, discrimination, a, study, in, the, journal, child, development, indicated, that, minority, disabled, children, are, more, likely, to, receive, punitive, discipline, in, low, and, middle, income, countries, due, to, the, fact, that, children, with, disabilities, are, mistreated, more, often, than, those, without, disability, racialized, children, in, this, category, are, at, an, even, higher, risk, with, respect, to, disability, in, the, united, states, camille, a, nelson, writing, for, the, berkeley, journal, of, criminal, law, notes, the, dual, discrimination, that, racial, minorities, with, disabilities, experience, from, the, criminal, justice, system, expressing, that, for, people, who, are, negatively, racialized, that, is, people, who, are, perceived, as, being, non, white, and, for, whom, mental, illness, is, either, known, or, assumed, interaction, with, police, is, precarious, and, potentially, dangerous, the, marginalization, of, people, with, disabilities, can, leave, persons, with, disabilities, unable, to, actualize, what, society, expects, of, gendered, existence, this, lack, of, recognition, for, their, gender, identity, can, leave, persons, with, disabilities, with, feelings, of, inadequacy, thomas, j, gerschick, of, illinois, state, university, describes, why, this, denial, of, gendered, identity, occurs, bodies, operate, socially, as, canvases, on, which, gender, is, displayed, and, kinesthetically, as, the, mechanisms, by, which, it, is, physically, enacted, thus, the, bodies, of, people, with, disabilities, make, them, vulnerable, to, being, denied, recognition, as, women, and, men, to, the, extent, that, women, and, men, with, disabilities, are, gendered, the, interactions, of, these, two, identities, lead, to, different, experiences, women, with, disabilities, face, a, sort, of, double, stigmatization, in, which, their, membership, to, both, of, these, marginalized, categories, simultaneously, exacerbates, the, negative, stereotypes, associated, with, each, as, they, are, ascribed, to, them, however, according, to, the, framework, of, intersectionality, gender, and, disability, intersect, to, create, a, unique, experience, that, is, not, simply, the, coincidence, of, being, a, woman, and, having, a, disability, separately, but, the, unique, experience, of, being, a, woman, with, a, disability, it, follows, that, the, more, marginalized, groups, one, belongs, to, their, experience, of, privilege, or, oppression, changes, in, short, a, black, woman, and, a, white, woman, will, experience, disability, differently, according, to, the, un, woman, watch, persistence, of, certain, cultural, legal, and, institutional, barriers, makes, women, and, girls, with, disabilities, the, victims, of, two, fold, discrimination, as, women, and, as, persons, with, disabilities, as, rosemarie, garland, thomson, puts, it, women, with, disabilities, even, more, intensely, than, women, in, general, have, been, cast, in, the, collective, cultural, imagination, as, inferior, lacking, excessive, incapable, unfit, and, useless, similar, to, the, intersections, of, race, and, disability, or, gender, and, disability, a, person, s, socio, economic, background, will, also, change, their, experience, of, disability, a, disabled, person, with, a, low, socio, economic, status, will, experience, the, world, differently, with, more, obstacles, and, fewer, opportunities, than, a, disabled, person, with, a, high, socio, economic, status, a, good, example, of, the, intersection, between, disability, and, socio, economic, status, is, access, to, education, as, we, know, that, there, are, direct, links, between, poverty, and, disability, often, working, in, a, vicious, cycle, the, costs, of, special, education, and, caring, for, a, disabled, child, are, higher, than, for, a, child, with, no, acknowledged, disability, which, poses, an, immense, barrier, in, accessing, appropriate, education, the, inaccessibility, of, appropriate, education, at, any, stage, can, lead, to, difficulties, in, finding, employment, which, often, results, in, the, vicious, cycle, of, being, bound, by, one, s, experience, as, a, poor, and, disabled, person, to, remain, in, the, same, social, structure, and, experience, socio, economic, exclusion, in, short, this, vicious, cycle, exacerbates, the, lack, of, economic, social, and, cultural, capital, for, disabled, people, with, a, low, socio, economic, background, on, the, other, hand, a, disabled, person, of, a, high, socio, economic, status, may, have, an, easier, time, accessing, appropriate, special, education, or, treatment, for, example, by, having, access, to, better, aids, resources, or, programmes, that, can, help, them, succeed, the, paralympic, games, meaning, alongside, the, olympics, are,
