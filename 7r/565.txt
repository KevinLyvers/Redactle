rights, of, man, had, been, proposed, at, the, 1945, san, francisco, conference, which, led, to, the, founding, of, the, united, nations, and, the, economic, and, social, council, was, given, the, task, of, drafting, it, early, on, in, the, process, the, document, was, split, into, a, declaration, setting, forth, general, principles, of, human, rights, and, a, convention, or, covenant, containing, binding, commitments, the, former, evolved, into, the, udhr, and, was, adopted, on, 10, december, 1948, drafting, continued, on, the, convention, but, there, remained, significant, differences, between, un, members, on, the, relative, importance, of, negative, civil, and, political, versus, positive, economic, social, and, cultural, rights, these, eventually, caused, the, convention, to, be, split, into, two, separate, covenants, one, to, contain, civil, and, political, rights, and, the, other, to, contain, economic, social, and, cultural, rights, the, two, covenants, were, to, contain, as, many, similar, provisions, as, possible, and, be, opened, for, signature, simultaneously, each, would, also, contain, an, article, on, the, right, of, all, peoples, to, self, determination, the, first, document, became, the, international, covenant, on, civil, and, political, rights, and, the, second, the, international, covenant, on, economic, social, and, cultural, rights, the, drafts, were, presented, to, the, un, general, assembly, for, discussion, in, 1954, and, adopted, in, 1966, the, covenant, follows, the, structure, of, the, udhr, and, the, iccpr, with, a, preamble, and, thirty, one, articles, divided, into, five, parts, part, 1, article, 1, recognises, the, right, of, all, peoples, to, self, determination, including, the, right, to, freely, determine, their, political, status, pursue, their, economic, social, and, cultural, goals, and, manage, and, dispose, of, their, own, resources, it, recognises, a, negative, right, of, a, people, not, to, be, deprived, of, its, means, of, subsistence, and, imposes, an, obligation, on, those, parties, still, responsible, for, non, self, governing, and, trust, territories, colonies, to, encourage, and, respect, their, self, determination, part, 2, articles, 2, 5, establishes, the, principle, of, progressive, realisation, see, below, it, also, requires, the, rights, be, recognised, without, discrimination, of, any, kind, as, to, race, colour, sex, language, religion, political, or, other, opinion, national, or, social, origin, property, birth, or, other, status, the, rights, can, only, be, limited, by, law, in, a, manner, compatible, with, the, nature, of, the, rights, and, only, for, the, purpose, of, promoting, the, general, welfare, in, a, democratic, society, part, 3, articles, 6, 15, lists, the, rights, themselves, these, include, rights, to, as, negative, and, positive, rights, are, rights, that, oblige, either, action, positive, rights, or, inaction, negative, rights, many, of, these, aforementioned, rights, include, specific, actions, which, must, be, undertaken, to, realise, them, as, they, are, positive, economic, social, and, cultural, rights, that, go, beyond, relatively, inaction, based, civil, and, political, negative, rights, part, 4, articles, 16, 25, governs, reporting, and, monitoring, of, the, covenant, and, the, steps, taken, by, the, parties, to, implement, it, it, also, allows, the, monitoring, body, originally, the, united, nations, economic, and, social, council, now, the, committee, on, economic, social, and, cultural, rights, see, below, to, make, general, recommendations, to, the, un, general, assembly, on, appropriate, measures, to, realise, the, rights, article, 21, part, 5, articles, 26, 31, governs, ratification, entry, into, force, and, amendment, of, the, covenant, article, 2, of, the, covenant, imposes, a, duty, on, all, parties, to, take, steps, to, the, maximum, of, its, available, resources, with, a, view, to, achieving, progressively, the, full, realization, of, the, rights, recognized, in, the, present, covenant, by, all, appropriate, means, including, particularly, the, adoption, of, legislative, measures, this, is, known, as, the, principle, of, progressive, realisation, it, acknowledges, that, some, of, the, rights, for, example, the, right, to, health, may, be, difficult, in, practice, to, achieve, in, a, short, period, of, time, and, that, states, may, be, subject, to, resource, constraints, but, requires, them, to, act, as, best, they, can, within, their, means, the, principle, differs, from, that, of, the, iccpr, which, obliges, parties, to, respect, and, to, ensure, to, all, individuals, within, its, territory, and, subject, to, its, jurisdiction, the, rights, in, that, convention, however, it, does, not, render, the, covenant, meaningless, the, requirement, to, take, steps, imposes, a, continuing, obligation, to, work, towards, the, realisation, of, the, rights, it, also, rules, out, deliberately, regressive, measures, which, impede, that, goal, the, committee, on, economic, social, and, cultural, rights, also, interprets, the, principle, as, imposing, minimum, core, obligations, to, provide, at, the, least, minimum, essential, levels, of, each, of, the, rights, if, resources, are, highly, constrained, this, should, include, the, use, of, targeted, programmes, aimed, at, the, vulnerable, the, committee, on, economic, social, and, cultural, rights, regards, legislation, as, an, indispensable, means, for, realizing, the, rights, which, is, unlikely, to, be, limited, by, resource, constraints, the, enacting, of, anti, discrimination, provisions, and, the, establishment, of, enforceable, rights, with, judicial, remedies, within, national, legal, systems, are, considered, to, be, appropriate, means, some, provisions, such, as, anti, discrimination, laws, are, already, required, under, other, human, rights, instruments, such, as, the, iccpr, article, 6, of, the, covenant, recognizes, the, right, to, work, as, defined, by, the, opportunity, of, everyone, to, gain, a, means, of, sustenance, by, means, of, freely, chosen, or, accepted, work, parties, are, required, to, take, appropriate, steps, to, safeguard, this, right, including, technical, and, vocational, training, and, economic, policies, aimed, at, steady, economic, development, and, ultimately, full, employment, the, right, implies, parties, must, guarantee, equal, access, to, employment, and, protect, workers, from, being, unfairly, deprived, of, employment, they, must, prevent, discrimination, in, the, workplace, and, ensure, access, for, the, disadvantaged, the, fact, that, work, must, be, freely, chosen, or, accepted, means, parties, must, prohibit, forced, or, child, labour, the, work, referred, to, in, article, 6, must, be, decent, work, this, is, effectively, defined, by, article, 7, of, the, covenant, which, recognises, the, right, of, everyone, to, just, and, favourable, working, conditions, these, are, in, turn, defined, as, fair, wages, with, equal, pay, for, equal, work, sufficient, to, provide, a, decent, living, for, workers, and, their, dependants, safe, working, conditions, equal, opportunity, in, the, workplace, and, sufficient, rest, and, leisure, including, limited, working, hours, and, regular, paid, holidays, article, 8, recognises, the, right, of, workers, to, form, or, join, trade, unions, and, protects, the, right, to, strike, however, it, allows, these, rights, to, be, restricted, for, members, of, the, armed, forces, police, or, government, administrators, several, parties, have, placed, reservations, on, this, clause, allowing, it, to, be, interpreted, in, a, manner, consistent, with, their, constitutions, e, g, china, mexico, or, extending, the, restriction, of, union, rights, to, groups, such, as, firefighters, e, g, japan, article, 9, of, the, covenant, recognises, the, right, of,

disability, maternity, employment, injury, unemployment, or, old, age, to, provide, for, survivors, orphans, and, those, who, cannot, afford, health, care, and, to, ensure, that, families, are, adequately, supported, benefits, from, such, a, scheme, must, be, adequate, accessible, to, all, and, provided, without, discrimination, the, covenant, does, not, restrict, the, form, of, the, scheme, and, both, contributory, and, non, contributory, schemes, are, permissible, as, are, community, based, and, mutual, schemes, the, committee, on, economic, social, and, cultural, rights, has, noted, persistent, problems, with, the, implementation, of, this, right, with, very, low, levels, of, access, several, parties, including, france, and, monaco, have, reservations, allowing, them, to, set, residence, requirements, in, order, to, qualify, for, social, benefits, the, committee, on, economic, social, and, cultural, rights, permits, such, restrictions, provided, they, are, proportionate, and, reasonable, article, 10, of, the, covenant, recognises, the, family, as, the, natural, and, fundamental, group, unit, of, society, and, requires, parties, to, accord, it, the, widest, possible,
