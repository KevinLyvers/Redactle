water, pollution, or, aquatic, pollution, is, the, contamination, of, water, bodies, with, a, negative, impact, on, their, uses, 6, it, is, usually, a, result, of, human, activities, water, bodies, include, lakes, rivers, oceans, aquifers, reservoirs, and, groundwater, water, pollution, results, when, contaminants, mix, with, these, water, bodies, contaminants, can, come, from, one, of, four, main, sources, these, are, sewage, discharges, industrial, activities, agricultural, activities, and, urban, runoff, including, stormwater, water, pollution, may, affect, either, surface, water, or, groundwater, this, form, of, pollution, can, lead, to, many, problems, one, is, the, degradation, of, aquatic, ecosystems, another, is, spreading, water, borne, diseases, when, people, use, polluted, water, for, drinking, or, irrigation, water, pollution, also, reduces, the, ecosystem, services, such, as, drinking, water, provided, by, the, water, resource, sources, of, water, pollution, are, either, point, sources, or, non, point, sources, point, sources, have, one, identifiable, cause, such, as, a, storm, drain, a, wastewater, treatment, plant, or, an, oil, spill, non, point, sources, are, more, diffuse, an, example, is, agricultural, runoff, pollution, is, the, result, of, the, cumulative, effect, over, time, pollution, may, take, many, forms, one, would, is, toxic, substances, such, as, oil, metals, plastics, pesticides, persistent, organic, pollutants, and, industrial, waste, products, another, is, stressful, conditions, such, as, changes, of, ph, hypoxia, or, anoxia, increased, temperatures, excessive, turbidity, or, changes, of, salinity, the, introduction, of, pathogenic, organisms, is, another, contaminants, may, include, organic, and, inorganic, substances, a, common, cause, of, thermal, pollution, is, the, use, of, water, as, a, coolant, by, power, plants, and, industrial, manufacturers, control, of, water, pollution, requires, appropriate, infrastructure, and, management, plans, as, well, as, legislation, technology, solutions, can, include, improving, sanitation, sewage, treatment, industrial, wastewater, treatment, agricultural, wastewater, treatment, erosion, control, sediment, control, and, control, of, urban, runoff, including, stormwater, management, a, practical, definition, of, water, pollution, is, water, pollution, is, the, addition, of, substances, or, energy, forms, that, directly, or, indirectly, alter, the, nature, of, the, water, body, in, such, a, manner, that, negatively, affects, its, legitimate, uses, 6, water, is, typically, referred, to, as, polluted, when, it, is, impaired, by, anthropogenic, contaminants, due, to, these, contaminants, it, either, no, longer, supports, a, certain, human, use, such, as, drinking, water, or, undergoes, a, marked, shift, in, its, ability, to, support, its, biotic, communities, such, as, fish, the, following, compounds, can, all, reach, water, bodies, via, raw, sewage, or, even, treated, sewage, discharges, inadequately, treated, wastewater, can, convey, nutrients, pathogens, heterogenous, suspended, solids, and, organic, fecal, matter, 6, bacteria, viruses, protozoans, and, parasitic, worms, are, examples, of, pathogens, that, can, be, found, in, wastewater, 47, in, practice, indicator, organisms, are, used, to, investigate, pathogenic, pollution, of, water, because, the, detection, of, pathogenic, organisms, in, water, sample, is, difficult, and, costly, because, of, their, low, concentrations, the, indicators, bacterial, indicator, of, fecal, contamination, of, water, samples, most, commonly, used, are, total, coliforms, tc, or, fecal, coliforms, fc, the, latter, also, referred, to, as, thermotolerant, coliforms, such, as, escherichia, coli, 52, 53, pathogens, can, produce, waterborne, diseases, in, either, human, or, animal, hosts, some, microorganisms, sometimes, found, in, contaminated, surface, waters, that, have, caused, human, health, problems, include, burkholderia, pseudomallei, cryptosporidium, parvum, giardia, lamblia, salmonella, norovirus, and, other, viruses, and, parasitic, worms, including, the, schistosoma, type, the, source, of, high, levels, of, pathogens, in, water, bodies, can, be, from, human, feces, due, to, open, defecation, sewage, blackwater, or, manure, that, has, found, its, way, into, the, water, body, the, cause, for, this, can, be, lack, of, sanitation, procedures, or, poorly, functioning, on, site, sanitation, systems, septic, tanks, pit, latrines, sewage, treatment, plants, without, disinfection, steps, sanitary, sewer, overflows, and, combined, sewer, overflows, csos, during, storm, events, and, intensive, agriculture, poorly, managed, livestock, operations, organic, substances, that, enter, water, bodies, are, often, toxic, 229, per, and, polyfluoroalkyl, substances, pfas, are, persistent, organic, pollutants, inorganic, water, pollutants, include, for, example, the, environmental, effect, of, pharmaceuticals, and, personal, care, products, ppcps, is, being, investigated, since, at, least, the, 1990s, ppcps, include, substances, used, by, individuals, for, personal, health, or, cosmetic, reasons, and, the, products, used, by, agribusiness, to, boost, growth, or, health, of, livestock, more, than, twenty, million, tons, of, ppcps, are, produced, every, year, the, european, union, has, declared, pharmaceutical, residues, with, the, potential, of, contamination, of, water, and, soil, to, be, priority, substances, ppcps, have, been, detected, in, water, bodies, throughout, the, world, more, research, is, needed, to, evaluate, the, risks, of, toxicity, persistence, and, bioaccumulation, but, the, current, state, of, research, shows, that, personal, care, products, impact, the, environment, and, other, species, such, as, coral, reefs, and, fish, ppcps, encompass, environmental, persistent, pharmaceutical, pollutants, eppps, and, are, one, type, of, persistent, organic, pollutants, they, are, not, removed, in, conventional, sewage, treatment, plants, but, require, a, fourth, treatment, stage, which, not, many, plants, have, solid, waste, can, enter, water, bodies, through, untreated, sewage, combined, sewer, overflows, urban, runoff, people, discarding, garbage, into, the, environment, wind, carrying, municipal, solid, waste, from, landfills, and, so, forth, this, results, in, macroscopic, pollution, large, visible, items, polluting, the, water, but, also, microplastics, pollution, that, is, not, directly, visible, the, terms, marine, debris, and, marine, plastic, pollution, are, used, in, the, context, of, pollution, of, oceans, microplastics, persist, in, the, environment, at, high, levels, particularly, in, aquatic, and, marine, ecosystems, where, they, cause, water, pollution, 35, of, all, ocean, microplastics, come, from, textiles, clothing, primarily, due, to, the, erosion, of, polyester, acrylic, or, nylon, based, clothing, often, during, the, washing, process, stormwater, untreated, sewage, and, wind, are, the, primary, conduits, for, microplastics, from, land, to, sea, synthetic, fabrics, tyres, and, city, dust, are, the, most, common, sources, of, microplastics, these, three, sources, account, for, more, than, 80, of, all, microplastic, contamination, surface, water, pollution, includes, pollution, of, rivers, lakes, and, oceans, a, subset, of, surface, water, pollution, is, marine, pollution, which, affects, the, oceans, nutrient, pollution, refers, to, contamination, by, excessive, inputs, of, nutrients, globally, about, 4, 5, billion, people, do, not, have, safely, managed, sanitation, as, of, 2017, according, to, an, estimate, by, the, joint, monitoring, programme, for, water, supply, and, sanitation, lack, of, access, to, sanitation, is, concerning, and, often, leads, to, water, pollution, e, g, via, the, practice, of, open, defecation, during, rain, events, or, floods, the, human, feces, are, moved, from, the, ground, where, they, were, deposited, into, surface, waters, simple, pit, latrines, may, also, get, flooded, during, rain, events, as, of, 2022, europe, and, central, asia, account, for, around, 16, of, global, microplastics, discharge, into, the, seas, and, although, management, of, plastic, waste, and, its, recycling, is, improving, globally, the, absolute, amount, of, plastic, pollution, continues, to, increase, unabated, due, to, the, large, amount, of, plastic, that, is, being, produced, and, disposed, of, even, if, sea, plastic, pollution, were, to, stop, entirely, microplastic, contamination, of, the, surface, ocean, would, be, projected, to, continue, to, increase, elevated, water, temperatures, decrease, oxygen, levels, due, to, lower, levels, of, dissolved, oxygen, as, gases, are, less, soluble, in, warmer, liquids, which, can, kill, fish, which, may, then, rot, and, alter, food, chain, composition, reduce, species, biodiversity, and, foster, invasion, by, new, thermophilic, species, 179, 375, the, introduction, of, aquatic, invasive, organisms, is, a, form, of, water, pollution, as, well, it, causes, biological, pollution, in, many, areas, of, the, world, groundwater, pollution, poses, a, hazard, to, the, wellbeing, of, people, and, ecosystems, one, quarter, of, the, world, s, population, depends, on, groundwater, for, drinking, yet, concentrated, recharging, is, known, to, carry, short, lived, contaminants, into, carbonate, aquifers, and, jeopardize, the, purity, of, those, waters, point, source, water, pollution, refers, to, contaminants, that, enter, a, waterway, from, a, single, identifiable, source, such, as, a, pipe, or, ditch, examples, of, sources, in, this, category, include, discharges, from, a, sewage, treatment, plant, a, factory, or, a, city, storm, drain, the, u, s, clean, water, act, cwa, defines, point, source, for, regulatory, enforcement, purposes, see, united, states, regulation, of, point, source, water, pollution, the, cwa, definition, of, point, source, was, amended, in, 1987, to, include, municipal, storm, sewer, systems, as, well, as, industrial, storm, water, such, as, from, construction, sites, sewage, typically, consists, of, 99, 9, water, and, 0, 1, solids, sewage, contributes, many, classes, of, nutrients, that, lead, to, eutrophication, it, is, a, major, source, of, phosphate, for, example, sewage, is, often, contaminated, with, diverse, compounds, found, in, personal, hygiene, cosmetics, pharmaceutical, drugs, see, also, drug, pollution, and, their, metabolites, water, pollution, due, to, environmental, persistent, pharmaceutical, pollutants, can, have, wide, ranging, consequences, when, sewers, overflow, during, storm, events, this, can, lead, to, water, pollution, from, untreated, sewage, such, events, are, called, sanitary, sewer, overflows, or, combined, sewer, overflows, industrial, processes, that, use, water, also, produce, wastewater, this, is, called, industrial, wastewater, using, the, us, as, an, example, the, main, industrial, consumers, of, water, using, over, 60, of, the, total, consumption, are, power, plants, petroleum, refineries, iron, and, steel, mills, pulp, and, paper, mills, and, food, processing, industries, some, industries, discharge, chemical, wastes, including, solvents, and, heavy, metals, which, are, toxic, and, other, harmful, pollutants, industrial, wastewater, could, add, the, following, pollutants, to, receiving, water, bodies, if, the, wastewater, is, not, treated, and, managed, properly, agriculture, is, a, major, contributor, to, water, pollution, from, nonpoint, sources, the, use, of, fertilizers, as, well, as, surface, runoff, from, farm, fields, pastures, and, feedlots, leads, to, nutrient, pollution, in, addition, to, plant, focused, agriculture, fish, farming, is, also, a, source, of, pollution, additionally, agricultural, runoff, often, contains, high, levels, of, pesticides, air, deposition, is, a, process, whereby, air, pollutants, from, industrial, or, natural, sources, settle, into, water, bodies, the, deposition, may, lead, to, polluted, water, near, the, source, or, at, distances, up, to, a, few, thousand, miles, away, the, most, frequently, observed, water, pollutants, resulting, from, industrial, air, deposition, are, sulfur, compounds, nitrogen, compounds, mercury, compounds, other, heavy, metals, and, some, pesticides, and, industrial, by, products, natural, sources, of, air, deposition, include, forest, fires, and, microbial, activity, acid, rain, is, caused, by, emissions, of, sulfur, dioxide, and, nitrogen, oxide, which, react, with, the, water, molecules, in, the, atmosphere, to, produce, acids, some, governments, have, made, efforts, since, the, 1970s, to, reduce, the, release, of, sulfur, dioxide, and, nitrogen, oxide, into, the, atmosphere, the, main, source, of, sulfur, and, nitrogen, compounds, that, result, in, acid, rain, are, anthropogenic, but, nitrogen, oxides, can, also, be, produced, naturally, by, lightning, strikes, and, sulphur, dioxide, is, produced, by, volcanic, eruptions, acid, rain, can, have, harmful, effects, on, plants, aquatic, ecosystems, and, infrastructure, carbon, dioxide, concentrations, in, the, atmosphere, have, increased, since, the, 1850s, due, anthropogenic, influences, emissions, of, greenhouse, gases, this, leads, to, ocean, acidification, and, is, another, form, of, water, pollution, from, atmospheric, contributions, water, pollution, may, be, analyzed, through, several, broad, categories, of, methods, physical, chemical, and, biological, some, methods, may, be, conducted, in, situ, without, sampling, such, as, temperature, others, involve, collection, of, samples, followed, by, specialized, analytical, tests, in, the, laboratory, standardized, validated, analytical, test, methods, for, water, and, wastewater, samples, have, been, published, common, physical, tests, of, water, include, temperature, specific, conductance, or, electrical, conductance, ec, or, conductivity, solids, concentrations, e, g, total, suspended, solids, tss, and, turbidity, water, samples, may, be, examined, using, analytical, chemistry, methods, many, published, test, methods, are, available, for, both, organic, and, inorganic, compounds, frequently, used, parameters, that, are, quantified, are, ph, bod, 102, chemical, oxygen, demand, cod, 104, dissolved, oxygen, do, total, hardness, nutrients, nitrogen, and, phosphorus, compounds, e, g, nitrate, and, orthophosphates, metals, including, copper, zinc, cadmium, lead, and, mercury, oil, and, grease, total, petroleum, hydrocarbons, tph, surfactants, and, pesticides, the, use, of, a, biomonitor, or, bioindicator, is, described, as, biological, monitoring, this, refers, to, the, measurement, of, specific, properties, of, an, organism, to, obtain, information, on, the, surrounding, physical, and, chemical, environment, biological, testing, involves, the, use, of, plant, animal, or, microbial, indicators, to, monitor, the, health, of, an, aquatic, ecosystem, they, are, any, biological, species, or, group, of, species, whose, function, population, or, status, can, reveal, what, degree, of, ecosystem, or, environmental, integrity, is, present, one, example, of, a, group, of, bio, indicators, are, the, copepods, and, other, small, water, crustaceans, that, are, present, in, many, water, bodies, such, organisms, can, be, monitored, for, changes, biochemical, physiological, or, behavioral, that, may, indicate, a, problem, within, their, ecosystem, water, pollution, is, a, major, global, environmental, problem, because, it, can, result, in, the, degradation, of, all, aquatic, ecosystems, fresh, coastal, and, ocean, waters, the, specific, contaminants, leading, to, pollution, in, water, include, a, wide, spectrum, of, chemicals, pathogens, and, physical, changes, such, as, elevated, temperature, while, many, of, the, chemicals, and, substances, that, are, regulated, may, be, naturally, occurring, calcium, sodium, iron, manganese, etc, the, concentration, usually, determines, what, is, a, natural, component, of, water, and, what, is, a, contaminant, high, concentrations, of, naturally, occurring, substances, can, have, negative, impacts, on, aquatic, flora, and, fauna, oxygen, depleting, substances, may, be, natural, materials, such, as, plant, matter, e, g, leaves, and, grass, as, well, as, human, made, chemicals, other, natural, and, anthropogenic, substances, may, cause, turbidity, cloudiness, which, blocks, light, and, disrupts, plant, growth, and, clogs, the, gills, of, some, fish, species, a, study, published, in, 2017, stated, that, polluted, water, spread, gastrointestinal, diseases, and, parasitic, infections, and, killed, 1, 8, million, people, these, are, also, referred, to, as, waterborne, diseases, persistent, exposure, to, pollutants, through, water, are, environmental, health, hazards, which, can, increase, the, likelihood, for, one, to, develop, cancer, or, other, diseases, nitrogen, pollution, can, cause, eutrophication, especially, in, lakes, eutrophication, is, an, increase, in, the, concentration, of, chemical, nutrients, in, an, ecosystem, to, an, extent, that, increases, the, primary, productivity, of, the, ecosystem, subsequent, negative, environmental, effects, such, as, anoxia, oxygen, depletion, and, severe, reductions, in, water, quality, may, occur, 131, this, can, harm, fish, and, other, animal, populations, ocean, acidification, is, another, impact, of, water, pollution, ocean, acidification, is, the, ongoing, decrease, in, the, ph, value, of, the, earth, s, oceans, caused, by, the, uptake, of, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, from, the, atmosphere, water, pollution, is, a, problem, in, developing, countries, as, well, as, in, developed, countries, for, example, water, pollution, in, india, and, china, is, widespread, about, 90, percent, of, the, water, in, the, cities, of, china, is, polluted, one, aspect, of, environmental, protection, are, mandatory, regulations, but, they, are, only, part, of, the, solution, other, important, tools, in, pollution, control, include, environmental, education, economic, instruments, market, forces, and, stricter, enforcements, standards, can, be, precise, for, a, defined, quantifiable, minimum, or, maximum, value, for, a, pollutant, or, imprecise, which, would, require, the, use, of, best, available, technology, bat, or, best, practicable, environmental, option, bpeo, market, based, economic, instruments, for, pollution, control, can, include, charges, subsidies, deposit, or, refund, schemes, the, creation, of, a, market, in, pollution, credits, and, enforcement, incentives, moving, towards, a, holistic, approach, in, chemical, pollution, control, combines, the, following, approaches, integrated, control, measures, trans, boundary, considerations, complementary, and, supplementary, control, measures, life, cycle, considerations, the, impacts, of, chemical, mixtures, control, of, water, pollution, requires, appropriate, infrastructure, and, management, plans, the, infrastructure, may, include, wastewater, treatment, plants, for, example, sewage, treatment, plants, and, industrial, wastewater, treatment, plants, agricultural, wastewater, treatment, for, farms, and, erosion, control, at, construction, sites, can, also, help, prevent, water, pollution, effective, control, of, urban, runoff, includes, reducing, speed, and, quantity, of, flow, water, pollution, requires, ongoing, evaluation, and, revision, of, water, resource, policy, at, all, levels, international, down, to, individual, aquifers, and, wells, municipal, wastewater, can, be, treated, by, centralized, sewage, treatment, plants, decentralized, wastewater, systems, nature, based, solutions, or, in, onsite, sewage, facilities, and, septic, tanks, for, example, waste, stabilization, ponds, can, be, a, low, cost, treatment, option, for, sewage, 182, uv, light, sunlight, can, be, used, to, degrade, some, pollutants, in, waste, stabilization, ponds, sewage, lagoons, the, use, of, safely, managed, sanitation, services, would, prevent, water, pollution, caused, by, lack, of, access, to, sanitation, well, designed, and, operated, systems, i, e, with, secondary, treatment, stages, or, more, advanced, tertiary, treatment, can, remove, 90, percent, or, more, of, the, pollutant, load, in, sewage, some, plants, have, additional, systems, to, remove, nutrients, and, pathogens, while, such, advanced, treatment, techniques, will, undoubtedly, reduce, the, discharges, of, micropollutants, they, can, also, result, in, large, financial, costs, as, well, as, environmentally, undesirable, increases, in, energy, consumption, and, greenhouse, gas, emissions, sewer, overflows, during, storm, events, can, be, addressed, by, timely, maintenance, and, upgrades, of, the, sewerage, system, in, the, us, cities, with, large, combined, systems, have, not, pursued, system, wide, separation, projects, due, to, the, high, cost, but, have, implemented, partial, separation, projects, and, green, infrastructure, approaches, in, some, cases, municipalities, have, installed, additional, cso, storage, facilities, or, expanded, sewage, treatment, capacity, sediment, from, construction, sites, can, be, managed, by, installation, of, erosion, controls, such, as, mulching, and, hydroseeding, and, sediment, controls, such, as, sediment, basins, and, silt, fences, discharge, of, toxic, chemicals, such, as, motor, fuels, and, concrete, washout, can, be, prevented, by, use, of, spill, prevention, and, control, plans, and, specially, designed, containers, e, g, for, concrete, washout, and, structures, such, as, overflow, controls, and, diversion, berms, erosion, caused, by, deforestation, and, changes, in, hydrology, soil, loss, due, to, water, runoff, also, results, in, loss, of, sediment, and, potentially, water, pollution, effective, control, of, urban, runoff, involves, reducing, the, velocity, and, flow, of, stormwater, as, well, as, reducing, pollutant, discharges, local, governments, use, a, variety, of, stormwater, management, techniques, to, reduce, the, effects, of, urban, runoff, these, techniques, called, best, management, practices, for, water, pollution, bmps, in, some, countries, may, focus, on, water, quantity, control, while, others, focus, on, improving, water, quality, and, some, perform, both, functions, in, the, philippines, republic, act, 9275, otherwise, known, as, the, philippine, clean, water, act, of, 2004, is, the, governing, law, on, wastewater, management, it, states, that, it, is, the, country, s, policy, to, protect, preserve, and, revive, the, quality, of, its, fresh, brackish, and, marine, waters, for, which, wastewater, management, plays, a, particular, role, in, 2024, the, royal, academy, of, engineering, released, a, study, into, the, effects, wastewater, on, public, health, in, the, united, kingdom, the, study, gained, media, attention, with, comments, from, the, uks, leading, health, professionals, including, sir, chris, whitty, outlining, 15, recommendations, for, various, uk, bodies, to, dramatically, reduce, public, health, risks, by, increasing, the, water, quality, in, its, waterways, such, as, rivers, and, lakes, after, the, release, of, the, report, the, guardian, newspaper, interviewed, whitty, who, stated, that, improving, water, quality, and, sewage, treatment, should, be, a, high, level, of, importance, and, a, public, health, priority, he, compared, it, to, eradicating, cholera, in, the, 19th, century, in, the, country, following, improvements, to, the, sewage, treatment, network, the, study, also, identified, that, low, water, flows, in, rivers, saw, high, concentration, levels, of, sewage, as, well, as, times, of, flooding, or, heavy, rainfall, while, heavy, rainfall, had, always, been, associated, with, sewage, overflows, into, streams, and, rivers, the, british, media, went, as, far, to, warn, parents, of, the, dangers, of, paddling, in, shallow, rivers, during, warm, weather, whitty, s, comments, came, after, the, study, revealed, that, the, uk, was, experiencing, a, growth, in, the, number, of, people, that, were, using, coastal, and, inland, waters, recreationally, this, could, be, connected, to, a, growing, interest, in, activities, such, as, open, water, swimming, or, other, water, sports, despite, this, growth, in, recreation, poor, water, quality, meant, some, were, becoming, unwell, during, events, most, notably, the, 2024, paris, olympics, had, to, delay, numerous, swimming, focused, events, like, the, triathlon, due, to, high, levels, of, sewage, in, the, river, seine
