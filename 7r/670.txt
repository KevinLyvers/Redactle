public, policy, is, an, institutionalized, proposal, or, a, decided, set, of, elements, like, laws, regulations, guidelines, and, actions, to, solve, or, address, relevant, and, real, world, problems, guided, by, a, conception, and, often, implemented, by, programs, these, policies, govern, and, include, various, aspects, of, life, such, as, education, health, care, employment, finance, economics, transportation, and, all, over, elements, of, society, the, implementation, of, public, policy, is, known, as, public, administration, public, policy, can, be, considered, the, sum, of, a, government, s, direct, and, indirect, activities, and, has, been, conceptualized, in, a, variety, of, ways, they, are, created, and, or, enacted, on, behalf, of, the, public, typically, by, a, government, sometimes, they, are, made, by, nonprofit, organizations, or, are, made, in, co, production, with, communities, or, citizens, which, can, include, potential, experts, scientists, engineers, and, stakeholders, or, scientific, data, or, sometimes, use, some, of, their, results, they, are, typically, made, by, policy, makers, affiliated, with, in, democratic, polities, currently, elected, politicians, therefore, the, policy, process, is, a, complex, political, process, in, which, there, are, many, actors, elected, politicians, political, party, leaders, pressure, groups, civil, servants, publicly, employed, professionals, judges, non, governmental, organizations, international, agencies, academic, experts, journalists, and, even, sometimes, citizens, who, see, themselves, as, the, passive, recipients, of, policy, a, popular, way, of, understanding, and, engaging, in, public, policy, is, through, a, series, of, stages, known, as, the, policy, cycle, which, was, first, discussed, by, the, political, scientist, harold, laswell, in, his, book, the, decision, process, seven, categories, of, functional, analysis, published, in, 1956, the, characterization, of, particular, stages, can, vary, but, a, basic, sequence, is, agenda, setting, policy, formulation, legitimation, implementation, and, evaluation, it, divides, the, policy, process, into, a, series, of, stages, from, a, notional, starting, point, at, which, policymakers, begin, to, think, about, a, policy, problem, to, a, notional, end, point, at, which, a, policy, has, been, implemented, and, policymakers, think, about, how, successful, it, has, been, before, deciding, what, to, do, next, officials, considered, policymakers, bear, the, responsibility, to, advance, the, interests, of, various, stakeholders, policy, design, entails, conscious, and, deliberate, effort, to, define, policy, aims, and, map, them, instrumentally, academics, and, other, experts, in, policy, studies, have, developed, a, range, of, tools, and, approaches, to, help, in, this, task, government, action, is, the, decisions, policies, and, actions, taken, by, governments, which, can, have, a, significant, impact, on, individuals, organizations, and, society, at, large, regulations, subsidies, taxes, and, spending, plans, are, just, a, few, of, the, various, shapes, it, might, take, achieving, certain, social, or, economic, objectives, such, as, fostering, economic, expansion, lowering, inequality, or, safeguarding, the, environment, is, the, aim, of, government, action, public, policy, can, be, conceptualized, in, varying, ways, according, to, the, purposes, of, the, speaker, or, author, and, the, characteristics, of, the, situation, they, are, concerned, with, one, dividing, line, in, conceptions, of, public, policy, is, between, those, that, see, it, primarily, in, terms, of, ideas, principles, and, plans, of, action, and, those, that, see, it, as, a, collection, of, empirical, phenomena, the, things, that, are, done, and, their, outcomes, the, first, of, these, conceptualizations, is, suitable, when, the, matter, of, concern, is, relatively, simple, and, unambiguous, and, the, means, of, enactment, are, expected, to, be, highly, disciplined, but, where, the, matter, is, complex, and, or, contested, where, intentions, are, confused, and, or, disguised, it, may, not, be, possible, to, define, the, policy, ideas, clearly, and, unambiguously, in, this, case, it, may, be, useful, to, identify, a, policy, in, terms, of, what, actually, happens, david, easton, in, the, usa, of, the, 1950s, provided, an, illustration, of, the, need, he, found, to, broaden, his, conceptualization, of, public, policy, beyond, stated, ideas, if, the, formal, policy, of, an, educational, system, forbids, discrimination, against, negroes, but, local, school, boards, or, administrators, so, zone, school, attendance, that, negroes, are, segregated, in, a, few, schools, both, the, impartial, law, and, discriminatory, practices, must, be, considered, part, of, the, policy, easton, characterized, public, policy, as, a, web, of, decisions, and, actions, that, allocates, values, other, definitions, of, public, policy, in, terms, of, a, broad, range, of, empirical, phenomena, include, that, of, paul, cairney, the, sum, total, of, government, action, from, signals, of, intent, to, the, final, outcomes, an, example, of, conceiving, public, policy, as, ideas, is, a, definition, by, richard, titmuss, the, principles, that, govern, action, directed, towards, given, ends, titmuss, perspective, was, particularly, one, of, social, contract, ethics, more, recently, antonio, lassance, has, defined, public, policy, as, an, institutionalized, proposal, to, solve, a, central, problem, guided, by, a, conception, lassance, 2020, 7, lassance, s, perspective, and, concerns, are, grounded, in, a, theory, of, change, or, program, theory, which, he, believes, can, be, empirically, tested, one, of, the, most, known, and, controversial, concepts, of, public, policy, is, that, of, thomas, r, dye, according, to, whom, public, policy, is, whatever, governments, choose, to, do, or, not, to, do, dye, 1972, 2, although, widely, used, dye, s, concept, is, also, criticized, as, being, an, empty, concept, dye, himself, admitted, that, his, concept, discourages, elaborate, academic, discussions, of, the, definition, of, public, policy, we, say, simply, that, public, policy, is, whatever, governments, choose, to, do, or, not, to, do, in, an, institutionalist, view, the, foundation, of, public, policy, is, composed, of, national, constitutional, laws, and, regulations, further, foundational, aspects, include, both, judicial, interpretations, and, regulations, which, are, generally, authorized, by, legislation, public, policy, is, considered, strong, when, it, solves, problems, efficiently, and, effectively, serves, and, supports, governmental, institutions, and, policies, and, encourages, active, citizenship, in, his, book, advanced, introduction, to, public, policy, b, guy, peters, defines, public, policy, as, the, set, of, activities, that, governments, engage, in, for, the, purpose, of, changing, their, economy, and, society, effectively, saying, that, public, policy, is, legislation, brought, in, with, the, aim, of, benefiting, or, impacting, the, electorate, in, some, way, in, another, definition, author, b, dente, in, his, book, understanding, policy, decisions, explains, public, policy, as, a, set, of, actions, that, affect, the, solution, of, a, policy, problem, i, e, a, dissatisfaction, regarding, a, certain, need, demand, or, opportunity, for, public, intervention, its, quality, is, measured, by, the, capacity, to, create, public, value, other, scholars, define, public, policy, as, a, system, of, courses, of, action, regulatory, measures, laws, and, funding, priorities, concerning, a, given, topic, promulgated, by, a, governmental, entity, or, its, representatives, public, policy, is, commonly, embodied, in, constitutions, legislative, acts, and, judicial, decisions, transformative, constitutions, of, global, south, considers, judicial, actions, for, public, policy, as, paramount, since, the, political, forces, that, facilitate, legislative, decisions, may, run, counter, to, the, will, of, the, people, public, policy, focuses, on, the, decisions, that, create, the, outputs, of, a, political, system, such, as, transport, policies, the, management, of, a, public, health, service, the, administration, of, a, system, schooling, and, the, organization, of, a, defense, force, the, directly, measurable, policy, outputs, actions, actually, taken, in, pursuance, of, policy, decisions, and, statements, can, be, differentiated, from, the, broader, policy, outcomes, focus, on, a, policy, s, societal, consequences, in, the, united, states, this, concept, refers, not, only, to, the, result, of, policies, but, more, broadly, to, the, decision, making, and, analysis, of, governmental, decisions, as, an, academic, discipline, public, policy, is, studied, by, professors, and, students, at, public, policy, schools, of, major, universities, throughout, the, country, the, u, s, professional, association, of, public, policy, practitioners, researchers, scholars, and, students, is, the, association, for, public, policy, analysis, and, management, much, of, public, policy, is, concerned, with, evaluating, decision, making, in, governments, and, public, bureaucracies, public, policy, making, can, be, characterized, as, a, dynamic, complex, and, interactive, system, through, which, public, problems, are, identified, and, resolved, through, the, creation, of, new, policy, or, reform, of, existing, policy, public, problems, can, originate, in, endless, ways, and, require, different, policy, responses, such, as, regulations, subsidies, import, quotas, and, laws, on, the, local, national, or, international, level, the, public, problems, that, influence, public, policy, making, can, be, of, economic, social, or, political, nature, a, government, holds, a, legal, monopoly, to, initiate, or, threaten, physical, force, to, achieve, its, ends, when, necessary, for, instance, in, times, of, chaos, when, quick, decision, making, is, needed, a, topology, model, can, be, used, to, demonstrate, the, types, of, and, implementation, of, public, policy, the, direct, section, of, money, explains, that, a, form, of, direct, action, is, either, using, the, resources, already, publicly, available, make, or, contracting, the, private, sector, to, address, the, issue, buy, the, indirect, section, of, money, explains, means, to, dissuade, or, encourage, behavior, using, money, literally, through, taxing, the, undesired, behavior, and, subsidizing, the, desired, behavior, the, direct, section, of, other, echoes, the, direct, section, of, money, however, instead, of, using, fiscal, power, the, state, uses, authoritative, power, to, enforce, this, this, comes, in, ways, of, making, an, action, mandatory, oblige, or, prohibiting, the, behavior, by, threatening, of, law, prohibit, the, indirect, section, of, other, is, spreading, information, on, an, issue, to, the, public, inform, and, making, calls, to, action, on, an, issue, implore, it, is, through, a, combined, effort, of, these, means, that, a, state, addresses, and, works, on, any, given, issue, public, policy, making, is, a, time, consuming, policy, cycle, the, policy, cycle, as, set, out, in, understanding, public, policy, theories, and, issues, agenda, setting, identifies, problems, that, require, government, attention, deciding, which, issue, deserve, the, most, attention, and, defining, the, nature, of, the, problem, most, public, problems, are, made, through, the, reflection, of, social, and, ideological, values, as, societies, and, communities, evolve, over, time, the, nature, in, which, norms, customs, and, morals, are, proven, acceptable, unacceptable, desirable, or, undesirable, changes, as, well, thus, the, search, of, crucial, problems, to, solve, becomes, difficult, to, distinguish, within, top, down, governmental, bodies, the, policy, stream, is, a, concept, developed, by, john, kingdon, as, a, model, proposed, to, show, compelling, problems, need, to, be, conjoined, with, two, other, factors, appropriate, political, climate, and, favorable, and, feasible, solutions, attached, to, problems, that, flow, together, to, move, onto, policy, agenda, this, reinforces, the, policy, window, another, concept, demonstrating, the, critical, moment, within, a, time, and, situation, that, a, new, policy, could, be, motivated, because, the, definition, of, public, problems, are, not, obvious, they, are, most, often, denied, and, not, acted, upon, the, problem, stream, represents, a, policy, process, to, compromise, for, how, worthy, problems, are, to, create, policies, and, solutions, this, is, represented, in, five, discrete, factors, therefore, john, kingdon, s, model, suggests, the, policy, window, appears, through, the, emergence, and, connection, of, problems, politics, and, policies, emphasizing, an, opportunity, to, stimulate, and, initiate, new, policies, the, issue, attention, cycle, is, a, concept, developed, by, anthony, downs, 1972, where, problems, progress, through, five, distinct, stages, this, reinforces, how, the, policy, agenda, does, not, necessarily, lead, to, policy, change, as, public, interest, dissipates, most, problems, end, up, resolving, themselves, or, get, ignored, by, policymakers, its, key, stages, include, this, is, the, setting, of, the, objectives, for, the, policy, along, with, identifying, the, cost, and, effect, of, solutions, that, could, be, proposed, from, policy, instruments, legitimation, is, when, approval, support, for, the, policy, instruments, is, gathered, involving, one, of, or, a, combination, of, executive, approval, legislative, approval, and, seeking, consent, through, consultation, or, referendums, policy, implementation, is, establishing, or, employing, an, organization, to, take, responsibility, for, the, policy, making, sure, the, organization, has, the, resources, legal, authority, to, do, so, in, addition, to, making, sure, the, policy, is, carried, out, as, planned, an, example, of, this, would, be, the, department, of, education, being, set, up, enforcement, mechanisms, are, a, central, part, of, various, policies, enforcement, mechanisms, co, determine, natural, resource, governance, outcomes, and, pollution, related, policies, may, require, proper, enforcement, mechanisms, and, often, substitutes, to, have, a, positive, effect, enforcement, may, include, law, enforcement, or, combine, incentive, and, disincentive, based, policy, instruments, a, meta, analysis, of, policy, studies, across, multiple, policy, domains, suggests, enforcement, mechanisms, are, the, only, modifiable, treaty, design, choice, with, the, potential, to, improve, the, mostly, low, effectiveness, of, international, treaties, as, stated, by, paul, cairney, the, implementation, gap, are, the, stages, a, policy, must, go, through, before, an, authoritative, decision, is, made, and, carried, out, as, an, example, the, agenda, setting, stage, is, followed, by, the, policy, formulation, this, will, continue, until, the, policy, is, implemented, top, down, and, bottom, up, describe, the, process, of, policy, implementation, top, down, implementation, means, the, carrying, out, of, a, policy, at, the, top, i, e, central, government, or, legislature, the, bottom, up, approach, suggests, that, the, implementation, should, start, with, the, target, group, as, they, are, seen, as, the, actual, implementers, of, policy, evaluation, is, the, process, of, assessing, the, extent, to, which, the, policy, has, been, successful, or, if, this, was, the, right, policy, to, begin, with, was, it, implemented, correctly, and, if, so, did, it, go, as, expected, maintenance, is, when, the, policy, makers, decide, to, either, terminate, or, continue, the, policy, the, policy, is, usually, either, continued, as, is, modified, or, discontinued, this, cycle, will, unless, discontinued, go, back, to, the, agenda, setting, phase, and, the, cycle, will, commence, again, however, the, policy, cycle, is, illustrated, in, a, chronological, and, cyclical, structure, which, could, be, misleading, as, in, actuality, policymaking, would, include, overlapping, stages, between, the, multiple, interactions, of, policy, proposals, adjustments, decision, making, amongst, multiple, government, institutions, and, respective, authoritative, actors, likewise, although, its, heuristic, model, is, straightforward, and, easy, to, understand, the, cycle, is, not, totally, applicable, in, all, situations, of, policymaking, due, to, it, being, far, too, simple, as, there, are, more, crucial, steps, that, should, go, into, more, complex, real, life, scenarios, the, mainstream, tradition, of, policy, studies, has, been, criticized, for, oversimplifying, the, processes, of, public, policy, particularly, in, use, of, models, based, on, rational, choice, theory, failing, to, capture, the, current, dynamics, in, today, s, society, as, well, as, sustaining, ambiguities, and, misunderstandings, in, contrast, an, anthropological, approach, to, studying, public, policy, deconstructs, many, of, the, categories, and, concepts, that, are, currently, used, seeking, to, gain, a, deeper, understanding, of, the, configurations, of, actors, activities, and, influences, that, go, into, shaping, policy, decisions, implementations, and, results, each, system, is, influenced, by, different, public, problems, and, issues, and, has, different, stakeholders, as, such, each, requires, different, public, policy, in, public, policy, making, numerous, individuals, corporations, non, profit, organizations, and, interest, groups, compete, and, collaborate, to, influence, policymakers, to, act, in, a, particular, way, therefore, the, failure, is, possibly, not, only, the, politician, s, fault, because, he, she, is, never, the, lone, player, in, the, field, of, decision, making, there, is, a, multitude, of, actors, pursuing, their, goals, sometimes, complementary, often, competing, or, contradictory, ones, in, this, sense, public, policies, can, be, the, result, of, actors, involved, such, as, interest, organization, s, and, not, necessarily, the, will, of, the, public, furthermore, public, policy, is, also, affected, by, social, and, economic, conditions, prevailing, political, values, the, publics, mood, and, the, structure, of, government, which, all, play, a, role, in, the, complexity, of, public, policy, making, the, large, set, of, actors, in, the, public, policy, process, such, as, politicians, civil, servants, lobbyists, domain, experts, and, industry, or, sector, representatives, use, a, variety, of, tactics, and, tools, to, advance, their, aims, including, advocating, their, positions, publicly, attempting, to, educate, supporters, and, opponents, and, mobilizing, allies, on, a, particular, issue, the, use, of, effective, tools, and, instruments, determines, the, outcome, of, a, policy, many, actors, can, be, important, in, the, public, policy, process, but, government, officials, ultimately, choose, public, policy, in, response, to, the, public, issue, or, problem, at, hand, in, doing, so, government, officials, are, expected, to, meet, public, sector, ethics, and, take, the, needs, of, all, project, stakeholders, into, account, it, is, however, worth, noting, that, what, public, policy, is, put, forward, can, be, influenced, by, the, political, stance, of, the, party, in, power, following, the, 2008, 2009, financial, crisis, david, cameron, s, conservative, party, looked, to, implement, a, policy, of, austerity, in, 2010, after, winning, the, general, election, that, year, to, shore, up, the, economy, and, diminish, the, uk, s, national, debt, whilst, the, conservatives, saw, reducing, the, national, debt, as, an, absolute, priority, the, labour, party, since, the, effects, of, conservative, austerity, became, apparent, have, slated, the, policy, for, its, needless, pressure, on, the, working, classes, and, those, reliant, on, welfare, their, 2019, election, manifesto, stating, tory, cuts, pushed, our, public, services, to, breaking, point, and, that, the, conservatives, have, starved, our, education, system, of, funding, furthermore, in, the, us, members, of, congress, have, observed, that, partisan, rancour, ideological, disputes, and, decreased, willingness, to, compromise, on, policies, have, made, policy, making, far, more, difficult, than, it, was, only, a, decade, ago, these, are, good, examples, of, how, varying, political, beliefs, can, impact, what, is, perceived, as, paramount, for, the, electorate, since, societies, have, changed, in, the, past, decades, the, public, policy, making, system, changed, too, in, the, 2010s, public, policy, making, is, increasingly, goal, oriented, aiming, for, measurable, results, and, goals, and, decision, centric, focusing, on, decisions, that, must, be, taken, immediately, furthermore, mass, communications, and, technological, changes, such, as, the, widespread, availability, of, the, internet, have, caused, the, public, policy, system, to, become, more, complex, and, interconnected, this, is, because, there, is, a, new, level, of, scrutiny, which, the, tabloid, society, provides, of, the, decisions, made, by, politicians, and, policy, makers, often, concentrating, on, the, people, story, side, of, these, decisions, the, changes, pose, new, challenges, to, the, current, public, policy, systems, and, pressures, leaders, to, evolve, to, remain, effective, and, efficient, public, policies, come, from, all, governmental, entities, and, at, all, levels, legislatures, courts, bureaucratic, agencies, and, executive, offices, at, national, local, and, state, levels, on, the, federal, level, public, policies, are, laws, enacted, by, congress, executive, orders, issued, by, the, president, decisions, handed, down, by, the, us, supreme, court, and, regulations, issued, by, bureaucratic, agencies, on, the, local, public, policies, include, city, ordinances, fire, codes, and, traffic, regulations, they, also, take, the, form, of, written, rules, and, regulations, of, city, governmental, departments, the, police, fire, departments, street, repair, or, building, inspection, on, the, state, level, public, policies, involve, laws, enacted, by, the, state, legislatures, decisions, made, by, state, courts, rules, developed, by, state, bureaucratic, agencies, and, decisions, made, by, governors, in, the, contemporary, era, there, has, been, a, massive, influx, of, policy, analysis, however, there, is, no, evidence, to, suggest, that, this, influx, has, aided, to, solving, policy, issues, distributive, theory, claims, that, legislatures, in, reality, have, little, use, for, information, that, pertains, to, the, policies, they, vote, on, it, has, been, determined, that, instead, of, certain, fields, having, a, higher, concentration, of, information, and, analysis, it, is, rather, competitive, issues, that, are, focused, on, more, the, same, report, this, was, determined, from, also, reported, that, information, and, analysis, only, seemed, to, affect, issues, over, a, long, term, period, and, thusly, ineffective, at, reactionary, action, policy, design, entails, conscious, and, deliberate, effort, to, define, policy, aims, and, map, them, instrumentally, policy, design, proposes, critical, analysis, of, policy, instruments, and, their, implementation, uncertainties, policy, designers, face, include, in, brief, nevertheless, policy, design, is, elemental, for, the, succession, of, public, policy, with, it, comes, intricate, and, multi, level, approaches, but, it, is, necessary, for, good, careful, policy, design, to, be, considered, before, implementing, the, policy, data, driven, policy, is, a, policy, designed, by, a, government, based, on, existing, data, evidence, rational, analysis, and, use, of, information, technology, to, crystallize, problems, and, highlight, effective, solutions, data, driven, policy, making, aims, to, make, use, of, data, and, collaborate, with, citizens, to, co, create, policy, policy, makers, can, now, make, use, of, new, data, sources, and, technological, developments, like, artificial, intelligence, to, gain, new, insights, and, make, policy, decisions, which, contribute, to, societal, development, in, the, 2020s, policymakers, will, use, data, for, policies, and, public, service, design, while, responding, to, citizen, engagement, demands, the, anticipatory, governance, model, is, particularly, important, when, considering, the, sheer, amount, of, data, available, in, terms, of, using, new, technology, to, collect, analyze, and, disseminate, data, governments, are, only, just, beginning, to, utilize, data, science, for, policy, implementation, with, new, technologies, implemented, in, government, administration, a, more, complete, visualization, of, current, problems, will, emerge, allowing, for, more, precision, in, targeted, policy, making, data, science, involves, the, transformation, analysis, visualization, and, presentation, of, data, and, potentially, improve, the, quality, of, life, and, society, by, providing, a, more, informational, environment, for, public, debate, and, political, decision, making, some, examples, of, utilizing, data, science, in, public, policy, making, are, resource, optimization, improving, current, public, services, and, fraud, and, error, mitigation, data, sets, rarely, merge, between, government, agencies, or, within, agencies, or, countries, governments, this, is, beginning, to, change, with, the, covid, 19, pandemic, spreading, globally, in, early, 2020, forecasting, and, creating, data, models, to, prevent, the, propagation, of, the, virus, has, become, a, vital, approach, for, policy, makers, in, governments, around, the, world, user, centered, policies, are, policies, that, are, designed, and, implemented, with, the, end, users, or, those, who, are, impacted, by, the, policy, as, co, designers, policymakers, using, this, design, process, utilize, users, knowledge, of, their, lived, experiences, this, can, allow, for, policymakers, focus, on, including, both, comprehensiveness, and, comprehension, within, policies, to, aid, in, clarity, for, end, users, such, as, workers, or, organizations, the, small, system, dynamics, model, is, a, method, of, condensing, and, simplifying, the, understanding, of, complex, issues, related, to, overall, productivity, evidence, based, policy, is, associated, with, adrian, smith, because, in, his, 1996, presidential, address, to, the, royal, statistical, society, smith, questioned, the, current, process, of, policy, making, and, urged, for, a, more, evidence, based, approach, commenting, that, it, has, valuable, lessons, to, offer, some, policy, scholars, now, avoid, using, the, term, evidence, based, policy, using, others, such, as, evidence, informed, this, language, shift, allows, continued, thinking, about, the, underlying, desire, to, improve, evidence, use, in, terms, of, its, rigor, or, quality, while, avoiding, some, of, the, key, limitations, or, reductionist, ideas, at, times, seen, with, the, evidence, based, language, still, the, language, of, evidence, based, policy, is, widely, used, and, as, such, can, be, interpreted, to, reflect, a, desire, for, evidence, to, be, used, well, or, appropriately, in, one, way, or, another, such, as, by, ensuring, systematic, consideration, of, rigorous, and, high, quality, policy, relevant, evidence, or, by, avoiding, biased, and, erroneous, applications, of, evidence, for, political, ends, the, development, and, analysis, of, evidence, based, evidence, informed, policy, are, supported, by, multidisciplinary, public, policy, research, and, policy, analysis, unlike, the, uk, the, u, s, has, a, largely, devolved, government, with, power, at, local, state, and, federal, level, due, to, these, various, levels, of, governance, it, can, often, be, difficult, to, coordinate, passing, bills, and, legislation, and, there, is, often, disagreement, despite, this, the, system, allows, citizens, to, be, relatively, involved, in, inputting, legislation, furthermore, each, level, of, government, is, set, up, in, a, similar, way, with, similar, rules, and, all, pump, money, into, creating, what, is, hoped, to, be, effective, legislation, policy, creation, in, america, is, often, seen, as, unique, to, other, countries, as, an, academic, discipline, public, policy, brings, in, elements, of, many, social, science, fields, and, concepts, including, economics, sociology, political, economy, social, policy, program, evaluation, policy, analysis, and, public, management, all, as, applied, to, problems, of, governmental, administration, management, and, operations, at, the, same, time, the, study, of, public, policy, is, distinct, from, political, science, or, economics, in, its, focus, on, the, application, of, theory, to, practice, while, the, majority, of, public, policy, degrees, are, master, s, and, doctoral, degrees, there, are, several, universities, that, offer, undergraduate, education, in, public, policy, notable, institutions, include, traditionally, the, academic, field, of, public, policy, focused, on, domestic, policy, however, the, wave, of, economic, globalization, that, occurred, in, the, late, 20th, and, early, 21st, centuries, created, a, need, for, a, subset, of, public, policy, that, focused, on, global, governance, especially, as, it, relates, to, issues, that, transcend, national, borders, such, as, climate, change, terrorism, nuclear, proliferation, and, economic, development, consequently, many, traditional, public, policy, schools, had, to, adjust, their, curricula, to, better, suit, this, new, policy, landscape, as, well, as, develop, entirely, new, curricula, altogether, the, austrian, and, chicago, school, of, economics, criticise, public, policymakers, for, not, understanding, basic, economics, in, particular, a, member, of, the, chicago, school, of, economics, thomas, sowell, writes, under, popularly, elected, government, the, political, incentives, are, to, do, what, is, popular, even, if, the, consequences, are, worse, than, the, consequences, of, doing, nothing, or, doing, something, that, is, less, popular, therefore, since, economics, studies, the, consequences, of, decisions, that, are, made, about, the, use, of, land, labour, capital, and, other, resources, that, go, into, producing, the, volume, of, output, which, determines, a, country, s, standard, of, living, this, means, that, artificially, tampering, with, the, allocation, of, scarce, resources, such, as, implementing, certain, public, policies, such, as, price, controls, will, cause, inefficiency, in, the, economy, and, decline, in, the, standard, of, living, within, society, one, of, the, biggest, controversies, of, public, policy, is, that, policy, making, is, often, influenced, by, lobbyists, such, as, big, corporations, in, order, to, sway, policies, in, their, favour, the, national, rifle, association, of, america, nra, is, an, organisation, that, lobbies, united, states, lawmakers, to, oppose, stricter, gun, laws, another, controversy, surrounding, public, policy, is, that, much, like, anyone, policymakers, can, sometimes, hold, bias, and, end, up, looking, for, facts, that, can, prove, their, preconceptions, to, be, true, in, a, study, of, politicians, in, denmark, which, was, published, in, the, british, journal, of, political, science, it, was, established, that, they, interpreted, data, between, two, groups, in, a, case, study, more, successfully, when, there, was, no, labeling, based, on, class, or, status, as, opposed, to, when, they, were, labeled, according, to, their, class, or, status, their, preconceptions, affected, how, they, viewed, data
