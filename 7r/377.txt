the, turkic, languages, are, a, language, family, of, more, than, 35, documented, languages, spoken, by, the, turkic, peoples, of, eurasia, from, eastern, europe, and, southern, europe, to, central, asia, east, asia, north, asia, siberia, and, west, asia, the, turkic, languages, originated, in, a, region, of, east, asia, spanning, from, mongolia, to, northwest, china, where, proto, turkic, is, thought, to, have, been, spoken, from, where, they, expanded, to, central, asia, and, farther, west, during, the, first, millennium, they, are, characterized, as, a, dialect, continuum, turkic, languages, are, spoken, by, some, 200, million, people, the, turkic, language, with, the, greatest, number, of, speakers, is, turkish, spoken, mainly, in, anatolia, and, the, balkans, its, native, speakers, account, for, about, 38, of, all, turkic, speakers, followed, by, uzbek, characteristic, features, such, as, vowel, harmony, agglutination, subject, object, verb, order, and, lack, of, grammatical, gender, are, almost, universal, within, the, turkic, family, there, is, a, high, degree, of, mutual, intelligibility, upon, moderate, exposure, among, the, various, oghuz, languages, which, include, turkish, azerbaijani, turkmen, qashqai, chaharmahali, turkic, gagauz, and, balkan, gagauz, turkish, as, well, as, oghuz, influenced, crimean, tatar, other, turkic, languages, demonstrate, varying, amounts, of, mutual, intelligibility, within, their, subgroups, as, well, although, methods, of, classification, vary, the, turkic, languages, are, usually, considered, to, be, divided, into, two, branches, oghur, of, which, the, only, surviving, member, is, chuvash, and, common, turkic, which, includes, all, other, turkic, languages, turkic, languages, show, many, similarities, with, the, mongolic, tungusic, koreanic, and, japonic, languages, these, similarities, have, led, some, linguists, including, tal, t, tekin, to, propose, an, altaic, language, family, though, this, proposal, is, widely, rejected, by, historical, linguists, similarities, with, the, uralic, languages, even, caused, these, families, to, be, regarded, as, one, for, a, long, time, under, the, ural, altaic, hypothesis, however, there, has, not, been, sufficient, evidence, to, conclude, the, existence, of, either, of, these, macrofamilies, the, shared, characteristics, between, the, languages, are, attributed, presently, to, extensive, prehistoric, language, contact, turkic, languages, are, null, subject, languages, have, vowel, harmony, with, the, notable, exception, of, uzbek, due, to, strong, persian, tajik, influence, converbs, extensive, agglutination, by, means, of, suffixes, and, postpositions, and, lack, of, grammatical, articles, noun, classes, and, grammatical, gender, subject, object, verb, word, order, is, universal, within, the, family, in, terms, of, the, level, of, vowel, harmony, in, the, turkic, language, family, tuvan, is, characterized, as, almost, fully, harmonic, whereas, uzbek, is, the, least, harmonic, or, not, harmonic, at, all, taking, into, account, the, documented, historico, linguistic, development, of, turkic, languages, overall, both, inscriptional, and, textual, the, family, provides, over, one, millennium, of, documented, stages, as, well, as, scenarios, in, the, linguistic, evolution, of, vowel, harmony, which, in, turn, demonstrates, harmony, evolution, along, a, confidently, definable, trajectory, though, vowel, harmony, is, a, common, characteristic, of, major, language, families, spoken, in, inner, eurasia, mongolic, tungusic, uralic, and, turkic, the, type, of, harmony, found, in, them, differs, from, each, other, specifically, uralic, and, turkic, have, a, shared, type, of, vowel, harmony, called, palatal, vowel, harmony, whereas, mongolic, and, tungusic, represent, a, different, type, the, homeland, of, the, turkic, peoples, and, their, language, is, suggested, to, be, somewhere, between, the, transcaspian, steppe, and, northeastern, asia, manchuria, with, genetic, evidence, pointing, to, the, region, near, south, siberia, and, mongolia, as, the, inner, asian, homeland, of, the, turkic, ethnicity, similarly, several, linguists, including, juha, janhunen, roger, blench, and, matthew, spriggs, suggest, that, modern, day, mongolia, is, the, homeland, of, the, early, turkic, language, relying, on, proto, turkic, lexical, items, about, the, climate, topography, flora, fauna, people, s, modes, of, subsistence, turkologist, peter, benjamin, golden, locates, the, proto, turkic, urheimat, in, the, southern, taiga, steppe, zone, of, the, sayan, altay, region, extensive, contact, took, place, between, proto, turks, and, proto, mongols, approximately, during, the, first, millennium, bc, the, shared, cultural, tradition, between, the, two, eurasian, nomadic, groups, is, called, the, turco, mongol, tradition, the, two, groups, shared, a, similar, religion, system, tengrism, and, there, exists, a, multitude, of, evident, loanwords, between, turkic, languages, and, mongolic, languages, although, the, loans, were, bidirectional, today, turkic, loanwords, constitute, the, largest, foreign, component, in, mongolian, vocabulary, italian, historian, and, philologist, igor, de, rachewiltz, noted, a, significant, distinction, of, the, chuvash, language, from, other, turkic, languages, according, to, him, the, chuvash, language, does, not, share, certain, common, characteristics, with, turkic, languages, to, such, a, degree, that, some, scholars, consider, it, an, independent, chuvash, family, similar, to, uralic, and, turkic, languages, turkic, classification, of, chuvash, was, seen, as, a, compromise, solution, for, the, classification, purposes, some, lexical, and, extensive, typological, similarities, between, turkic, and, the, nearby, tungusic, and, mongolic, families, as, well, as, the, korean, and, japonic, families, has, in, more, recent, years, been, instead, attributed, to, prehistoric, contact, amongst, the, group, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, northeast, asian, sprachbund, a, more, recent, circa, first, millennium, bc, contact, between, core, altaic, turkic, mongolic, and, tungusic, is, distinguished, from, this, due, to, the, existence, of, definitive, common, words, that, appear, to, have, been, mostly, borrowed, from, turkic, into, mongolic, and, later, from, mongolic, into, tungusic, as, turkic, borrowings, into, mongolic, significantly, outnumber, mongolic, borrowings, into, turkic, and, turkic, and, tungusic, do, not, share, any, words, that, do, not, also, exist, in, mongolic, turkic, languages, also, show, some, chinese, loanwords, that, point, to, early, contact, during, the, time, of, proto, turkic, the, first, established, records, of, the, turkic, languages, are, the, eighth, century, ad, orkhon, inscriptions, by, the, g, kt, rks, recording, the, old, turkic, language, which, were, discovered, in, 1889, in, the, orkhon, valley, in, mongolia, the, compendium, of, the, turkic, dialects, div, n, l, gati, t, t, rk, written, during, the, 11th, century, ad, by, ka, garl, mahmud, of, the, kara, khanid, khanate, constitutes, an, early, linguistic, treatment, of, the, family, the, compendium, is, the, first, comprehensive, dictionary, of, the, turkic, languages, and, also, includes, the, first, known, map, of, the, turkic, speakers, geographical, distribution, it, mainly, pertains, to, the, southwestern, branch, of, the, family, the, codex, cumanicus, 12th, 13th, centuries, ad, concerning, the, northwestern, branch, is, another, early, linguistic, manual, between, the, kipchak, language, and, latin, used, by, the, catholic, missionaries, sent, to, the, western, cumans, inhabiting, a, region, corresponding, to, present, day, hungary, and, romania, the, earliest, records, of, the, language, spoken, by, volga, bulgars, debatably, the, parent, or, a, distant, relative, of, chuvash, language, are, dated, to, the, 13th, 14th, centuries, ad, with, the, turkic, expansion, during, the, early, middle, ages, c, 6th, 11th, centuries, ad, turkic, languages, in, the, course, of, just, a, few, centuries, spread, across, central, asia, from, siberia, to, the, mediterranean, various, terminologies, from, the, turkic, languages, have, passed, into, persian, urdu, ukrainian, russian, chinese, mongolian, hungarian, and, to, a, lesser, extent, arabic, the, geographical, distribution, of, turkic, speaking, peoples, across, eurasia, since, the, ottoman, era, ranges, from, the, north, east, of, siberia, to, turkey, in, the, west, see, picture, in, the, box, on, the, right, above, for, centuries, the, turkic, speaking, peoples, have, migrated, extensively, and, intermingled, continuously, and, their, languages, have, been, influenced, mutually, and, through, contact, with, the, surrounding, languages, especially, the, iranian, slavic, and, mongolic, languages, this, has, obscured, the, historical, developments, within, each, language, and, or, language, group, and, as, a, result, there, exist, several, systems, to, classify, the, turkic, languages, the, modern, genetic, classification, schemes, for, turkic, are, still, largely, indebted, to, samoilovich, 1922, the, turkic, languages, may, be, divided, into, six, branches, in, this, classification, oghur, turkic, is, also, referred, to, as, lir, turkic, and, the, other, branches, are, subsumed, under, the, title, of, shaz, turkic, or, common, turkic, it, is, not, clear, when, these, two, major, types, of, turkic, can, be, assumed, to, have, diverged, with, less, certainty, the, southwestern, northwestern, southeastern, and, oghur, groups, may, further, be, summarized, as, west, turkic, the, northeastern, kyrgyz, kipchak, and, arghu, khalaj, groups, as, east, turkic, geographically, and, linguistically, the, languages, of, the, northwestern, and, southeastern, subgroups, belong, to, the, central, turkic, languages, while, the, northeastern, and, khalaj, languages, are, the, so, called, peripheral, languages, hruschka, et, al, 2014, use, computational, phylogenetic, methods, to, calculate, a, tree, of, turkic, based, on, phonological, sound, changes, the, following, isoglosses, are, traditionally, used, in, the, classification, of, the, turkic, languages, additional, isoglosses, include, in, the, standard, istanbul, dialect, of, turkish, the, in, da, and, da, l, is, not, realized, as, a, consonant, but, as, a, slight, lengthening, of, the, preceding, vowel, the, following, table, is, based, mainly, upon, the, classification, scheme, presented, by, lars, johanson, the, following, is, a, brief, comparison, of, cognates, among, the, basic, vocabulary, across, the, turkic, language, family, about, 60, words, despite, being, cognates, some, of, the, words, may, denote, a, different, meaning, empty, cells, do, not, necessarily, imply, that, a, particular, language, is, lacking, a, word, to, describe, the, concept, but, rather, that, the, word, for, the, concept, in, that, language, may, be, formed, from, another, stem, and, is, not, cognate, with, the, other, words, in, the, row, or, that, a, loanword, is, used, in, its, place, also, there, may, be, shifts, in, the, meaning, from, one, language, to, another, and, so, the, common, meaning, given, is, only, approximate, in, some, cases, the, form, given, is, found, only, in, some, dialects, of, the, language, or, a, loanword, is, much, more, common, e, g, in, turkish, the, preferred, word, for, fire, is, the, persian, derived, ate, whereas, the, native, od, is, dead, forms, are, given, in, native, latin, orthographies, unless, otherwise, noted, to, press, with, one, s, knees, azerbaijani, and, ipa, azerbaijani, q, ipa, g, word, final, q, ipa, x, turkish, and, azerbaijani, karakhanid, turkmen, y, and, sakha, ipa, turkmen, karakhanid,

is, currently, regarded, as, one, of, the, world, s, primary, language, families, turkic, is, one, of, the, main, members, of, the, controversial, altaic, language, family, but, altaic, currently, lacks, support, from, a, majority, of, linguists, none, of, the, theories, linking, turkic, languages, to, other, families, have, a, wide, degree, of, acceptance, at, present, shared, features, with, languages, grouped, together, as, altaic, have, been, interpreted, by, most, mainstream, linguists, to, be, the, result, of, a, sprachbund, the, possibility, of, a, genetic, relation, between, turkic, and, korean, independently, from, altaic, is, suggested, by, some, linguists, the, linguist, kabak, 2004, of, the, university, of, w, rzburg, states, that, turkic, and, korean, share, similar, phonology, as, well, as, morphology, li, yong, s, ng, 2014, suggest, that, there, are, several, cognates, between, turkic, and, old, korean, he, states, that, these, supposed, cognates, can, be, useful, to, reconstruct, the, early, turkic, language, according, to, him, words, related, to, nature, earth, and, ruling, but, especially, to, the, sky, and, stars, seem, to, be, cognates, the, linguist, choi, suggested, already, in, 1996, a, close, relationship, between, turkic, and, korean, regardless, of, any, altaic, connections, in, addition, the, fact, that, the, morphological, elements, are, not, easily, borrowed, between, languages, added, to, the, fact, that, the, common, morphological, elements, between, korean, and, turkic, are, not, less, numerous, than, between, turkic, and, other, altaic, languages, strengthens, the, possibility, that, there, is, a, close, genetic, affinity, between, korean, and, turkic, many, historians, also, point, out, a, close, non, linguistic, relationship, between, turkic, peoples, and, koreans, especially, close, were, the, relations, between, the, g, kt, rks, and, goguryeo, some, linguists, suggested, a, relation, to, uralic, languages, especially, to, the, ugric, languages, this, view, is, rejected, and, seen, as, obsolete, by, mainstream, linguists, similarities, are, because, of, language, contact, and, borrowings, mostly, from, turkic, into, ugric, languages, stachowski, 2015, states, that, any, relation, between, turkic, and, uralic, must, be, a, contact, one
