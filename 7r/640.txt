a, nation, is, a, type, of, social, organization, where, a, collective, identity, a, national, identity, has, emerged, from, a, combination, of, shared, features, across, a, given, population, such, as, language, history, ethnicity, culture, territory, or, society, some, nations, are, constructed, around, ethnicity, see, ethnic, nationalism, while, others, are, bound, by, political, constitutions, see, civic, nationalism, a, nation, is, generally, more, overtly, political, than, an, ethnic, group, benedict, anderson, defines, a, nation, as, an, imagined, political, community, imagined, because, the, members, of, even, the, smallest, nation, will, never, know, most, of, their, fellow, members, meet, them, or, even, hear, of, them, yet, in, the, minds, of, each, lives, the, image, of, their, communion, while, anthony, d, smith, defines, nations, as, cultural, political, communities, that, have, become, conscious, of, their, autonomy, unity, and, particular, interests, the, consensus, among, scholars, is, that, nations, are, socially, constructed, historically, contingent, organizationally, flexible, and, a, distinctly, modern, phenomenon, throughout, history, people, have, had, an, attachment, to, their, kin, group, and, traditions, territorial, authorities, and, their, homeland, but, nationalism, the, belief, that, state, and, nation, should, align, as, a, nation, state, did, not, become, a, prominent, ideology, until, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, the, english, word, nation, from, middle, english, c, 1300, nacioun, a, race, of, people, large, group, of, people, with, common, ancestry, and, language, from, old, french, nacion, birth, naissance, rank, descendants, relatives, country, homeland, 12c, and, directly, from, latin, nationem, nominative, natio, n, t, supine, of, verb, nascar, to, birth, supine, natum, birth, origin, breed, stock, kind, species, race, of, people, tribe, literally, that, which, has, been, born, from, natus, past, participle, of, nasci, be, born, old, latin, gnasci, from, pie, root, gene, give, birth, beget, with, derivatives, referring, to, procreation, and, familial, and, tribal, groups, in, latin, natio, represents, the, children, of, the, same, birth, and, also, a, human, group, of, same, origin, by, cicero, natio, is, used, for, people, black, s, law, dictionary, defines, a, nation, as, follows, nation, n, 14c, 1, a, large, group, of, people, having, a, common, origin, language, tradition, and, usage, constitutes, a, political, entity, when, a, nation, is, coincident, with, a, state, the, term, nation, state, is, often, used, 2, a, community, of, people, inhabiting, a, defined, territory, and, organized, under, an, independent, government, a, sovereign, political, state, the, word, nation, is, sometimes, used, as, synonym, for, thus, the, phrase, nations, of, the, world, could, be, referring, to, the, top, level, governments, as, in, the, name, for, the, united, nations, various, large, geographical, territories, or, various, large, ethnic, groups, of, the, planet, depending, on, the, meaning, of, nation, used, the, term, nation, state, could, be, used, to, distinguish, larger, states, from, small, city, states, or, could, be, used, to, distinguish, multinational, states, from, those, with, a, single, ethnic, group, the, broad, consensus, amongst, scholars, of, nationalism, is, that, nations, are, a, recent, phenomenon, however, some, historians, argue, their, existence, can, be, traced, to, the, medieval, period, susan, reynolds, has, argued, that, many, european, medieval, kingdoms, were, nations, in, the, modern, sense, except, that, political, participation, in, nationalism, was, available, only, to, a, limited, prosperous, and, literate, class, while, adrian, hastings, claims, england, s, anglo, saxon, kings, mobilized, mass, nationalism, in, their, struggle, to, repel, norse, invasions, he, argues, that, alfred, the, great, in, particular, drew, on, biblical, language, in, his, law, code, and, that, during, his, reign, selected, books, of, the, bible, were, translated, into, old, english, to, inspire, englishmen, to, fight, to, turn, back, the, norse, invaders, hastings, argues, for, a, strong, renewal, of, english, nationalism, following, a, hiatus, after, the, norman, conquest, beginning, with, the, translation, of, the, complete, bible, into, english, by, the, wycliffe, circle, in, the, 1380s, positing, that, the, frequency, and, consistency, in, usage, of, the, word, nation, from, the, early, fourteenth, century, onward, strongly, suggest, english, nationalism, and, the, english, nation, have, been, continuous, since, that, time, however, john, breuilly, criticizes, hastings, s, assumption, that, continued, usage, of, a, term, such, as, english, means, continuity, in, its, meaning, patrick, j, geary, agrees, arguing, names, were, adapted, to, different, circumstances, by, different, powers, and, could, convince, people, of, continuity, even, if, radical, discontinuity, was, the, lived, reality, florin, curta, cites, medieval, bulgarian, nation, as, another, possible, example, danubian, bulgaria, was, founded, in, 680, 681, as, a, continuation, of, great, bulgaria, after, the, adoption, of, orthodox, christianity, in, 864, it, became, one, of, the, cultural, centres, of, slavic, europe, its, leading, cultural, position, was, consolidated, with, the, invention, of, the, cyrillic, script, in, its, capital, preslav, on, the, eve, of, the, 10th, century, hugh, poulton, argues, the, development, of, old, church, slavonic, literacy, in, the, country, had, the, effect, of, preventing, the, assimilation, of, the, south, slavs, into, neighboring, cultures, and, stimulated, the, development, of, a, distinct, ethnic, identity, a, symbiosis, was, carried, out, between, the, numerically, weak, bulgars, and, the, numerous, slavic, tribes, in, that, broad, area, from, the, danube, to, the, north, to, the, aegean, sea, to, the, south, and, from, the, adriatic, sea, to, the, west, to, the, black, sea, to, the, east, who, accepted, the, common, ethnonym, bulgarians, during, the, 10th, century, the, bulgarians, established, a, form, of, national, identity, that, was, far, from, modern, nationalism, but, helped, them, to, survive, as, a, distinct, entity, through, the, centuries, anthony, kaldellis, asserts, in, hellenism, in, byzantium, 2008, that, what, is, called, the, byzantine, empire, was, the, roman, empire, transformed, into, a, nation, state, in, the, middle, ages, azar, gat, also, argues, china, korea, and, japan, were, nations, by, the, time, of, the, european, middle, ages, in, contrast, geary, rejects, the, conflation, of, early, medieval, and, contemporary, group, identities, as, a, myth, arguing, it, is, a, mistake, to, conclude, continuity, based, on, the, recurrence, of, names, he, criticizes, historians, for, failing, to, recognize, the, differences, between, earlier, ways, of, perceiving, group, identities, and, more, contemporary, attitudes, stating, they, are, trapped, in, the, very, historical, process, we, are, attempting, to, study, similarly, sami, zubaida, notes, that, many, states, and, empires, in, history, ruled, over, ethnically, diverse, populations, and, shared, ethnicity, between, ruler, and, ruled, did, not, always, constitute, grounds, for, favour, or, mutual, support, he, goes, on, to, argue, ethnicity, was, never, the, primary, basis, of, identification, for, the, members, of, these, multinational, empires, paul, lawrence, criticises, hastings, s, reading, of, bede, observing, that, those, writing, so, called, national, histories, may, have, been, working, with, a, rather, different, notion, of, the, nation, to, those, writing, history, in, the, modern, period, lawrence, goes, on, to, argue, that, such, documents, do, not, demonstrate, how, ordinary, people, identified, themselves, pointing, out, that, while, they, serve, as, texts, in, which, an, elite, defines, itself, their, significance, in, relation, to, what, the, majority, thought, and, felt, was, likely, to, have, been, minor, a, significant, early, use, of, the, term, nation, as, natio, occurred, at, medieval, universities, to, describe, the, colleagues, in, a, college, or, students, above, all, at, the, university, of, paris, who, were, all, born, within, a, pays, spoke, the, same, language, and, expected, to, be, ruled, by, their, own, familiar, law, in, 1383, and, 1384, while, studying, theology, at, paris, jean, gerson, was, elected, twice, as, a, procurator, for, the, french, natio, the, university, of, prague, adopted, the, division, of, students, into, nationes, from, its, opening, in, 1349, the, studium, generale, which, consisted, of, bohemian, bavarian, saxon, and, polish, nations, in, a, similar, way, the, nationes, were, segregated, by, the, knights, hospitaller, of, jerusalem, who, maintained, at, rhodes, the, hostels, from, which, they, took, their, name, where, foreigners, eat, and, have, their, places, of, meeting, each, nation, apart, from, the, others, and, a, knight, has, charge, of, each, one, of, these, hostels, and, provides, for, the, necessities, of, the, inmates, according, to, their, religion, as, the, spanish, traveller, pedro, tafur, noted, in, 1436, in, his, article, the, mosaic, moment, an, early, modernist, critique, of, the, modernist, theory, of, nationalism, philip, s, gorski, argues, that, the, first, modern, nation, state, was, the, dutch, republic, created, by, a, fully, modern, political, nationalism, rooted, in, the, model, of, biblical, nationalism, in, a, 2013, article, biblical, nationalism, and, the, sixteenth, century, states, diana, muir, appelbaum, expands, gorski, s, argument, to, apply, to, a, series, of, new, protestant, sixteenth, century, nation, states, a, similar, albeit, broader, argument, was, made, by, anthony, d, smith, in, his, books, chosen, peoples, sacred, sources, of, national, identity, and, myths, and, memories, of, the, nation, in, her, book, nationalism, five, roads, to, modernity, liah, greenfeld, argued, that, nationalism, was, invented, in, england, by, 1600, according, to, greenfeld, england, was, the, first, nation, in, the, world, for, smith, creating, a, world, of, nations, has, had, profound, consequences, for, the, global, state, system, as, a, nation, comprises, both, a, cultural, and, political, identity, therefore, he, argues, any, attempt, to, forge, a, national, identity, is, also, a, political, action, with, political, consequences, like, the, need, to, redraw, the, geopolitical, map, or, alter, the, composition, of, political, regimes, and, states, there, are, three, notable, perspectives, on, how, nations, developed, primordialism, perennialism, which, reflects, popular, conceptions, of, nationalism, but, has, largely, fallen, out, of, favour, among, academics, proposes, that, there, have, always, been, nations, and, that, nationalism, is, a, natural, phenomenon, ethnosymbolism, explains, nationalism, as, a, dynamic, evolving, phenomenon, and, stresses, the, importance, of, symbols, myths, and, traditions, in, the, development, of, nations, and, nationalism, modernization, theory, which, has, superseded, primordialism, as, the, dominant, explanation, of, nationalism, adopts, a, constructivist, approach, and, proposes, that, nationalism, emerged, due, to, processes, of, modernization, such, as, industrialization, urbanization, and, mass, education, which, made, national, consciousness, possible, proponents, of, modernization, theory, describe, nations, as, imagined, communities, a, term, coined, by, benedict, anderson, a, nation, is, an, imagined, community, in, the, sense, that, the, material, conditions, exist, for, imagining, extended, and, shared, connections, and, that, it, is, objectively, impersonal, even, if, each, individual, in, the, nation, experiences, themselves, as, subjectively, part, of, an, embodied, unity, with, others, for, the, most, part, members, of, a, nation, remain, strangers, to, each, other, and, will, likely, never, meet, nationalism, is, consequently, seen, an, invented, tradition, in, which, shared, sentiment, provides, a, form, of, collective, identity, and, binds, individuals, together, in, political, solidarity, a, nation, s, foundational, story, may, be, built, around, a, combination, of, ethnic, attributes, values, and, principles, and, may, be, closely, connected, to, narratives, of, belonging, scholars, in, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, century, offered, constructivist, criticisms, of, primordial, theories, about, nations, a, prominent, lecture, by, ernest, renan, what, is, a, nation, argues, that, a, nation, is, a, daily, referendum, and, that, nations, are, based, as, much, on, what, the, people, jointly, forget, as, on, what, they, remember, carl, darling, buck, argued, in, a, 1916, study, nationality, is, essentially, subjective, an, active, sentiment, of, unity, within, a, fairly, extensive, group, a, sentiment, based, upon, real, but, diverse, factors, political, geographical, physical, and, social, any, or, all, of, which, may, be, present, in, this, or, that, case, but, no, one, of, which, must, be, present, in, all, cases, in, the, late, 20th, century, many, social, scientists, argued, that, there, were, two, types, of, nations, the, civic, nation, of, which, french, republican, society, was, the, principal, example, and, the, ethnic, nation, exemplified, by, the, german, peoples, the, german, tradition, was, conceptualized, as, originating, with, early, 19th, century, philosophers, like, johann, gottlieb, fichte, and, referred, to, people, sharing, a, common, language, religion, culture, history, and, ethnic, origins, that, differentiate, them, from, people, of, other, nations, on, the, other, hand, the, civic, nation, was, traced, to, the, french, revolution, and, ideas, deriving, from, 18th, century, french, philosophers, it, was, understood, as, being, centred, in, a, willingness, to, live, together, this, producing, a, nation, that, results, from, an, act, of, affirmation, this, is, the, vision, among, others, of, ernest, renan, there, is, an, ongoing, debate, about, the, future, of, nations, about, whether, this, framework, will, persist, as, is, and, whether, there, are, viable, or, developing, alternatives, the, theory, of, the, clash, of, civilizations, lies, in, direct, contrast, to, cosmopolitan, theories, about, an, ever, more, connected, world, that, no, longer, requires, nation, states, according, to, political, scientist, samuel, p, huntington, people, s, cultural, and, religious, identities, will, be, the, primary, source, of, conflict, in, the, post, cold, war, world, the, theory, was, originally, formulated, in, a, 1992, lecture, at, the, american, enterprise, institute, which, was, then, developed, in, a, 1993, foreign, affairs, article, titled, the, clash, of, civilizations, in, response, to, francis, fukuyama, s, 1992, book, the, end, of, history, and, the, last, man, huntington, later, expanded, his, thesis, in, a, 1996, book, the, clash, of, civilizations, and, the, remaking, of, world, order, huntington, began, his, thinking, by, surveying, the, diverse, theories, about, the, nature, of, global, politics, in, the, post, cold, war, period, some, theorists, and, writers, argued, that, human, rights, liberal, democracy, and, capitalist, free, market, economics, had, become, the, only, remaining, ideological, alternative, for, nations, in, the, post, cold, war, world, specifically, francis, fukuyama, in, the, end, of, history, and, the, last, man, argued, that, the, world, had, reached, a, hegelian, end, of, history, huntington, believed, that, while, the, age, of, ideology, had, ended, the, world, had, reverted, only, to, a, normal, state, of, affairs, characterized, by, cultural, conflict, in, his, thesis, he, argued, that, the, primary, axis, of, conflict, in, the, future, will, be, along, cultural, and, religious, lines, postnationalism, is, the, process, or, trend, by, which, nation, states, and, national, identities, lose, their, importance, relative, to, supranational, and, global, entities, several, factors, contribute, to, the, trend, huntington, identifies, including, economic, globalization, a, rise, in, importance, of, multinational, corporations, the, internationalization, of, financial, markets, the, transfer, of, socio, political, power, from, national, authorities, to, supranational, entities, such, as, multinational, corporations, the, united, nations, and, the, european, union, and, the, advent, of, new, information, and, culture, technologies, such, as, the, internet, however, attachment, to, citizenship, and, national, identities, often, remains, important, jan, zielonka, of, the, university, of, oxford, states, that, the, future, structure, and, exercise, of, political, power, will, resemble, the, medieval, model, more, than, the, westphalian, one, with, the, latter, being, about, concentration, of, power, sovereignty, and, clear, cut, identity, and, neo, medievalism, meaning, overlapping, authorities, divided, sovereignty, multiple, identities, and, governing, institutions, and, fuzzy, borders
