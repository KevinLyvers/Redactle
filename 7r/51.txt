discipline, investigating, areas, such, as, social, organization, organizational, adaptation, and, organizational, leadership, in, recent, decades, there, has, been, a, movement, for, evidence, based, management, the, english, verb, manage, has, its, roots, in, the, fifteenth, century, french, verb, mesnager, which, often, referred, in, equestrian, language, to, hold, in, hand, the, reins, of, a, horse, also, the, italian, term, maneggiare, to, handle, especially, tools, or, a, horse, is, possible, in, spanish, manejar, can, also, mean, to, rule, the, horses, these, three, terms, derive, from, the, two, latin, words, manus, hand, and, agere, to, act, the, french, word, for, housekeeping, m, nagerie, derived, from, m, nager, to, keep, house, compare, m, nage, for, household, also, encompasses, taking, care, of, domestic, animals, m, nagerie, is, the, french, translation, of, xenophon, s, famous, book, oeconomicus, greek, on, household, matters, and, husbandry, the, french, word, mesnagement, or, m, nagement, influenced, the, semantic, development, of, the, english, word, management, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, views, on, the, definition, and, scope, of, management, include, management, involves, identifying, the, mission, objective, procedures, rules, and, manipulation, of, the, human, capital, of, an, enterprise, to, contribute, to, the, success, of, the, enterprise, scholars, have, focused, on, the, management, of, individual, organizational, and, inter, organizational, relationships, this, implies, effective, communication, an, enterprise, environment, as, opposed, to, a, physical, or, mechanical, mechanism, implies, human, motivation, and, implies, some, sort, of, successful, progress, or, system, outcome, as, such, management, is, not, the, manipulation, of, a, mechanism, machine, or, automated, program, not, the, herding, of, animals, and, can, occur, either, in, a, legal, or, in, an, illegal, enterprise, or, environment, from, an, individual, s, perspective, management, does, not, need, to, be, seen, solely, from, an, enterprise, point, of, view, because, management, is, an, essential, function, in, improving, one, s, life, and, relationships, management, is, therefore, everywhere, and, it, has, a, wider, range, of, application, communication, and, a, positive, endeavor, are, two, main, aspects, of, it, either, through, enterprise, or, through, independent, pursuit, plans, measurements, motivational, psychological, tools, goals, and, economic, measures, profit, etc, may, or, may, not, be, necessary, components, for, there, to, be, management, at, first, one, views, management, functionally, such, as, measuring, quantity, adjusting, plans, and, meeting, goals, but, this, applies, even, in, situations, where, planning, does, not, take, place, from, this, perspective, henri, fayol, 1841, 1925, considers, management, to, consist, of, five, functions, in, another, way, of, thinking, mary, parker, follett, 1868, 1933, allegedly, defined, management, as, the, art, of, getting, things, done, through, people, she, described, management, as, a, philosophy, critics, however, find, this, definition, useful, but, far, too, narrow, the, phrase, management, is, what, managers, do, occurs, widely, suggesting, the, difficulty, of, defining, management, without, circularity, the, shifting, nature, of, definitions, and, the, connection, of, managerial, practices, with, the, existence, of, a, managerial, cadre, or, of, a, class, one, habit, of, thought, regards, management, as, equivalent, to, business, administration, and, thus, excludes, management, in, places, outside, commerce, for, example, in, charities, and, in, the, public, sector, more, broadly, every, organization, must, manage, its, work, people, processes, technology, etc, to, maximize, effectiveness, nonetheless, many, people, refer, to, university, departments, that, teach, management, as, business, schools,

risks, and, benefits, of, available, actions, and, the, preferences, and, values, of, those, affected, some, see, management, as, a, late, modern, in, the, sense, of, late, modernity, conceptualization, on, those, terms, it, cannot, have, a, pre, modern, history, only, harbingers, such, as, stewards, others, however, detect, management, like, thought, among, ancient, sumerian, traders, and, the, builders, of, the, pyramids, of, ancient, egypt, slave, owners, through, the, centuries, faced, the, problems, of, exploiting, and, motivating, a, dependent, but, sometimes, unenthusiastic, or, recalcitrant, workforce, but, many, pre, industrial, enterprises, given, their, small, scale, did, not, feel, compelled, to, face, the, issues, of, management, systematically, however, innovations, such, as, the, spread, of, arabic, numerals, 5th, to, 15th, centuries, and, the, codification, of, double, entry, book, keeping, 1494, provided, tools, for, management, assessment, planning, and, control, with, the, changing, workplaces, of, the, industrial, revolution, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, military, theory, and, practice, contributed, approaches, to, managing, the, newly, popular, factories, given, the, scale, of, most, commercial, operations, and, the, lack, of, mechanized, record, keeping, and, recording, before, the, industrial, revolution, it, made, sense, for, most, owners, of, enterprises, in, those, times, to, carry, out, management, functions, by, and, for, themselves, but, with, the, growing, size, and, complexity, of, organizations, a, distinction, between, owners, individuals, industrial, dynasties, or, groups, of, shareholders, and, day, to, day, managers, independent, specialists, in, planning, and, control, gradually, became, more, common, the, field, of, management, originated, in, ancient, china, including, possibly, the, first, highly, centralized, bureaucratic, state, and, the, earliest, by, the, second, century, bc, example, of, an, administration, based, on, merit, through, testing, some, theorists, have, cited, ancient, military, texts, as, providing, lessons, for, civilian, managers, for, example, chinese, general, sun, tzu, in, his, 6th, century, bc, work, the, art, of, war, recommends, when, re, phrased, in, modern, terminology, being, aware, of, and, acting, on, strengths, and, weaknesses, of, both, a, manager, s, organization, and, a, foe, s, the, writings, of, influential, chinese, legalist, philosopher, shen, buhai, may, be, considered, to, embody, a, rare, premodern, example, of, abstract, theory, of, administration, american, philosopher, herrlee, g, creel, and, other, scholars, find, the, influence, of, chinese, administration, in, europe, by, the, 12th, century, thomas, taylor, meadows, britain, s, consul, in, guangzhou, argued, in, his, desultory, notes, on, the, government, and, people, of, china, 1847, that, the, long, duration, of, the, chinese, empire, is, solely, and, altogether, owing, to, the, good, government, which, consists, in, the, advancement, of, men, of, talent, and, merit, only, and, that, the, british, must, reform, their, civil, service, by, making, the, institution, meritocratic, influenced, by, the, ancient, chinese, imperial, examination, the, northcote, trevelyan, report, of, 1854, recommended, that, recruitment, should, be, on, the, basis, of, merit, determined, through, competitive, examination, candidates, should, have, a, solid, general, education, to, enable, inter, departmental, transfers, and, promotion, should, be, through, achievement, rather, than, preferment, patronage, or, purchase, this, led, to, implementation, of, her, majesty, s, civil, service, as, a, systematic, meritocratic, civil, service, bureaucracy, like, the, british, the, development, of, french, bureaucracy, was, influenced, by, the, chinese, system, voltaire, claimed, that, the, chinese, had, perfected, moral, science, and, fran, ois, quesnay, advocated, an, economic, and, political, system, modeled, after, that, of, the, chinese, french, civil, service, examinations, adopted, in, the, late, 19th, century, were, also, heavily, based, on, general, cultural, studies, these, features, have, been, likened, to, the, earlier, chinese, model, various, ancient, and, medieval, civilizations, produced, mirrors, for, princes, books, which, aimed, to, advise, new, monarchs, on, how, to, govern, plato, described, job, specialization, in, 350, bc, and, alfarabi, listed, several, leadership, traits, in, ad, 900, other, examples, include, the, indian, arthashastra, by, chanakya, written, around, 300, bc, and, the, prince, by, italian, author, niccol, machiavelli, c, 1515, written, in, 1776, by, adam, smith, a, scottish, moral, philosopher, the, wealth, of, nations, discussed, efficient, organization, of, work, through, division, of, labour, smith, described, how, changes, in, processes, could, boost, productivity, in, the, manufacture, of, pins, while, individuals, could, produce, 200, pins, per, day, smith, analyzed, the, steps, involved, in, the, manufacture, and, with, 10, specialists, enabled, the, production, of, 48, 000, pins, per, day, classical, economists, such, as, adam, smith, 1723, 1790, and, john, stuart, mill, 1806, 1873, provided, a, theoretical, background, to, resource, allocation, production, economics, and, pricing, issues, about, the, same, time, innovators, like, eli, whitney, 1765, 1825, james, watt, 1736, 1819, and, matthew, boulton, 1728, 1809, developed, elements, of, technical, production, such, as, standardization, quality, control, procedures, cost, accounting, interchangeability, of, parts, and, work, planning, many, of, these, aspects, of, management, existed, in, the, pre, 1861, slave, based, sector, of, the, us, economy, that, environment, saw, 4, million, people, as, the, contemporary, usages, had, it, managed, in, profitable, quasi, mass, production, before, wage, slavery, eclipsed, chattel, slavery, salaried, managers, as, an, identifiable, group, first, became, prominent, in, the, late, 19th, century, as, large, corporations, began, to, overshadow, small, family, businesses, the, need, for, personnel, management, positions, became, more, necessary, businesses, grew, into, large, corporations, and, the, need, for, clerks, bookkeepers, secretaries, and, managers, expanded, the, demand, for, trained, managers, led, college, and, university, administrators, to, consider, and, move, forward, with, plans, to, create, the, first, schools, of, business, on, their, campuses, at, the, turn, of, the, twentieth, century, the, need, for, skilled, and, trained, managers, had, become, increasingly, apparent, the, demand, occurred, as, personnel, departments, began, to, expand, rapidly, in, 1915, less, than, one, in, twenty, manufacturing, firms, had, a, dedicated, personnel, department, by, 1929, that, number, had, grown, to, over, one, third, formal, management, education, became, standardized, at, colleges, and, universities, colleges, and, universities, capitalized, on, the, needs, of, corporations, by, forming, business, schools, and, corporate, placement, departments, this, shift, toward, formal, business, education, marked, the, creation, of, a, corporate, elite, in, the, us, by, about, 1900, one, finds, managers, trying, to, place, their, theories, on, what, they, regarded, as, a, thoroughly, scientific, basis, see, scientism, for, perceived, limitations, of, this, belief, examples, include, henry, r, towne,
