semantics, is, the, study, of, linguistic, meaning, it, examines, what, meaning, is, how, words, get, their, meaning, and, how, the, meaning, of, a, complex, expression, depends, on, its, parts, part, of, this, process, involves, the, distinction, between, sense, and, reference, sense, is, given, by, the, ideas, and, concepts, associated, with, an, expression, while, reference, is, the, object, to, which, an, expression, points, semantics, contrasts, with, syntax, which, studies, the, rules, that, dictate, how, to, create, grammatically, correct, sentences, and, pragmatics, which, investigates, how, people, use, language, in, communication, lexical, semantics, is, the, branch, of, semantics, that, studies, word, meaning, it, examines, whether, words, have, one, or, several, meanings, and, in, what, lexical, relations, they, stand, to, one, another, phrasal, semantics, studies, the, meaning, of, sentences, by, exploring, the, phenomenon, of, compositionality, or, how, new, meanings, can, be, created, by, arranging, words, formal, semantics, relies, on, logic, and, mathematics, to, provide, precise, frameworks, of, the, relation, between, language, and, meaning, cognitive, semantics, examines, meaning, from, a, psychological, perspective, and, assumes, a, close, relation, between, language, ability, and, the, conceptual, structures, used, to, understand, the, world, other, branches, of, semantics, include, conceptual, semantics, computational, semantics, and, cultural, semantics, theories, of, meaning, are, general, explanations, of, the, nature, of, meaning, and, how, expressions, are, endowed, with, it, according, to, referential, theories, the, meaning, of, an, expression, is, the, part, of, reality, to, which, it, points, ideational, theories, identify, meaning, with, mental, states, like, the, ideas, that, an, expression, evokes, in, the, minds, of, language, users, according, to, causal, theories, meaning, is, determined, by, causes, and, effects, which, behaviorist, semantics, analyzes, in, terms, of, stimulus, and, response, further, theories, of, meaning, include, truth, conditional, semantics, verificationist, theories, the, use, theory, and, inferentialist, semantics, the, study, of, semantic, phenomena, began, during, antiquity, but, was, not, recognized, as, an, independent, field, of, inquiry, until, the, 19th, century, semantics, is, relevant, to, the, fields, of, formal, logic, computer, science, and, psychology, semantics, is, the, study, of, meaning, in, languages, it, is, a, systematic, inquiry, that, examines, what, linguistic, meaning, is, and, how, it, arises, it, investigates, how, expressions, are, built, up, from, different, layers, of, constituents, like, morphemes, words, clauses, sentences, and, texts, and, how, the, meanings, of, the, constituents, affect, one, another, semantics, can, focus, on, a, specific, language, like, english, but, in, its, widest, sense, it, investigates, meaning, structures, relevant, to, all, languages, as, a, descriptive, discipline, it, aims, to, determine, how, meaning, works, without, prescribing, what, meaning, people, should, associate, with, particular, expressions, some, of, its, key, questions, are, how, do, the, meanings, of, words, combine, to, create, the, meanings, of, sentences, how, do, meanings, relate, to, the, minds, of, language, users, and, to, the, things, words, refer, to, and, what, is, the, connection, between, what, a, word, means, and, the, contexts, in, which, it, is, used, the, main, disciplines, engaged, in, semantics, are, linguistics, semiotics, and, philosophy, besides, its, meaning, as, a, field, of, inquiry, semantics, can, also, refer, to, theories, within, this, field, like, truth, conditional, semantics, and, to, the, meaning, of, particular, expressions, like, the, semantics, of, the, word, fairy, as, a, field, of, inquiry, semantics, has, both, an, internal, and, an, external, side, the, internal, side, is, interested, in, the, connection, between, words, and, the, mental, phenomena, they, evoke, like, ideas, and, conceptual, representations, the, external, side, examines, how, words, refer, to, objects, in, the, world, and, under, what, conditions, a, sentence, is, true, many, related, disciplines, investigate, language, and, meaning, semantics, contrasts, with, other, subfields, of, linguistics, focused, on, distinct, aspects, of, language, phonology, studies, the, different, types, of, sounds, used, in, languages, and, how, sounds, are, connected, to, form, words, while, syntax, examines, the, rules, that, dictate, how, to, arrange, words, to, create, sentences, these, divisions, are, reflected, in, the, fact, that, it, is, possible, to, master, some, aspects, of, a, language, while, lacking, others, like, when, a, person, knows, how, to, pronounce, a, word, without, knowing, its, meaning, as, a, subfield, of, semiotics, semantics, has, a, more, narrow, focus, on, meaning, in, language, while, semiotics, studies, both, linguistic, and, non, linguistic, signs, semiotics, investigates, additional, topics, like, the, meaning, of, non, verbal, communication, conventional, symbols, and, natural, signs, independent, of, human, interaction, examples, include, nodding, to, signal, agreement, stripes, on, a, uniform, signifying, rank, and, the, presence, of, vultures, indicating, a, nearby, animal, carcass, semantics, further, contrasts, with, pragmatics, which, is, interested, in, how, people, use, language, in, communication, an, expression, like, that, s, what, i, m, talking, about, can, mean, many, things, depending, on, who, says, it, and, in, what, situation, semantics, is, interested, in, the, possible, meanings, of, expressions, what, they, can, and, cannot, mean, in, general, in, this, regard, it, is, sometimes, defined, as, the, study, of, context, independent, meaning, pragmatics, examines, which, of, these, possible, meanings, is, relevant, in, a, particular, case, in, contrast, to, semantics, it, is, interested, in, actual, performance, rather, than, in, the, general, linguistic, competence, underlying, this, performance, this, includes, the, topic, of, additional, meaning, that, can, be, inferred, even, though, it, is, not, literally, expressed, like, what, it, means, if, a, speaker, remains, silent, on, a, certain, topic, a, closely, related, distinction, by, the, semiotician, charles, w, morris, holds, that, semantics, studies, the, relation, between, words, and, the, world, pragmatics, examines, the, relation, between, words, and, users, and, syntax, focuses, on, the, relation, between, different, words, semantics, is, related, to, etymology, which, studies, how, words, and, their, meanings, changed, in, the, course, of, history, another, connected, field, is, hermeneutics, which, is, the, art, or, science, of, interpretation, and, is, concerned, with, the, right, methodology, of, interpreting, text, in, general, and, scripture, in, particular, metasemantics, examines, the, metaphysical, foundations, of, meaning, and, aims, to, explain, where, it, comes, from, or, how, it, arises, the, word, semantics, originated, from, the, ancient, greek, adjective, semantikos, meaning, relating, to, signs, which, is, a, derivative, of, s, meion, the, noun, for, sign, it, was, initially, used, for, medical, symptoms, and, only, later, acquired, its, wider, meaning, regarding, any, type, of, sign, including, linguistic, signs, the, word, semantics, entered, the, english, language, from, the, french, term, semantique, which, the, linguist, michel, br, al, first, introduced, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, semantics, studies, meaning, in, language, which, is, limited, to, the, meaning, of, linguistic, expressions, it, concerns, how, signs, are, interpreted, and, what, information, they, contain, an, example, is, the, meaning, of, words, provided, in, dictionary, definitions, by, giving, synonymous, expressions, or, paraphrases, like, defining, the, meaning, of, the, term, ram, as, adult, male, sheep, there, are, many, forms, of, non, linguistic, meaning, that, are, not, examined, by, semantics, actions, and, policies, can, have, meaning, in, relation, to, the, goal, they, serve, fields, like, religion, and, spirituality, are, interested, in, the, meaning, of, life, which, is, about, finding, a, purpose, in, life, or, the, significance, of, existence, in, general, linguistic, meaning, can, be, analyzed, on, different, levels, word, meaning, is, studied, by, lexical, semantics, and, investigates, the, denotation, of, individual, words, it, is, often, related, to, concepts, of, entities, like, how, the, word, dog, is, associated, with, the, concept, of, the, four, legged, domestic, animal, sentence, meaning, falls, into, the, field, of, phrasal, semantics, and, concerns, the, denotation, of, full, sentences, it, usually, expresses, a, concept, applying, to, a, type, of, situation, as, in, the, sentence, the, dog, has, ruined, my, blue, skirt, the, meaning, of, a, sentence, is, often, referred, to, as, a, proposition, different, sentences, can, express, the, same, proposition, like, the, english, sentence, the, tree, is, green, and, the, german, sentence, der, baum, ist, gr, n, utterance, meaning, is, studied, by, pragmatics, and, is, about, the, meaning, of, an, expression, on, a, particular, occasion, sentence, meaning, and, utterance, meaning, come, apart, in, cases, where, expressions, are, used, in, a, non, literal, way, as, is, often, the, case, with, irony, semantics, is, primarily, interested, in, the, public, meaning, that, expressions, have, like, the, meaning, found, in, general, dictionary, definitions, speaker, meaning, by, contrast, is, the, private, or, subjective, meaning, that, individuals, associate, with, expressions, it, can, diverge, from, the, literal, meaning, like, when, a, person, associates, the, word, needle, with, pain, or, drugs, meaning, is, often, analyzed, in, terms, of, sense, and, reference, also, referred, to, as, intension, and, extension, or, connotation, and, denotation, the, referent, of, an, expression, is, the, object, to, which, the, expression, points, the, sense, of, an, expression, is, the, way, in, which, it, refers, to, that, object, or, how, the, object, is, interpreted, for, example, the, expressions, morning, star, and, evening, star, refer, to, the, same, planet, just, like, the, expressions, 2, 2, and, 3, 1, refer, to, the, same, number, the, meanings, of, these, expressions, differ, not, on, the, level, of, reference, but, on, the, level, of, sense, sense, is, sometimes, understood, as, a, mental, phenomenon, that, helps, people, identify, the, objects, to, which, an, expression, refers, some, semanticists, focus, primarily, on, sense, or, primarily, on, reference, in, their, analysis, of, meaning, to, grasp, the, full, meaning, of, an, expression, it, is, usually, necessary, to, understand, both, to, what, entities, in, the, world, it, refers, and, how, it, describes, them, the, distinction, between, sense, and, reference, can, explain, identity, statements, which, can, be, used, to, show, how, two, expressions, with, a, different, sense, have, the, same, referent, for, instance, the, sentence, the, morning, star, is, the, evening, star, is, informative, and, people, can, learn, something, from, it, the, sentence, the, morning, star, is, the, morning, star, by, contrast, is, an, uninformative, tautology, since, the, expressions, are, identical, not, only, on, the, level, of, reference, but, also, on, the, level, of, sense, compositionality, is, a, key, aspect, of, how, languages, construct, meaning, it, is, the, idea, that, the, meaning, of, a, complex, expression, is, a, function, of, the, meanings, of, its, parts, it, is, possible, to, understand, the, meaning, of, the, sentence, zuzana, owns, a, dog, by, understanding, what, the, words, zuzana, owns, a, and, dog, mean, and, how, they, are, combined, in, this, regard, the, meaning, of, complex, expressions, like, sentences, is, different, from, word, meaning, since, it, is, normally, not, possible, to, deduce, what, a, word, means, by, looking, at, its, letters, and, one, needs, to, consult, a, dictionary, instead, compositionality, is, often, used, to, explain, how, people, can, formulate, and, understand, an, almost, infinite, number, of, meanings, even, though, the, amount, of, words, and, cognitive, resources, is, finite, many, sentences, that, people, read, are, sentences, that, they, have, never, seen, before, and, they, are, nonetheless, able, to, understand, them, when, interpreted, in, a, strong, sense, the, principle, of, compositionality, states, that, the, meaning, of, a, complex, expression, is, not, just, affected, by, its, parts, and, how, they, are, combined, but, fully, determined, this, way, it, is, controversial, whether, this, claim, is, correct, or, whether, additional, aspects, influence, meaning, for, example, context, may, affect, the, meaning, of, expressions, idioms, like, kick, the, bucket, carry, figurative, or, non, literal, meanings, that, are, not, directly, reducible, to, the, meanings, of, their, parts, truth, is, a, property, of, statements, that, accurately, present, the, world, and, true, statements, are, in, accord, with, reality, whether, a, statement, is, true, usually, depends, on, the, relation, between, the, statement, and, the, rest, of, the, world, the, truth, conditions, of, a, statement, are, the, way, the, world, needs, to, be, for, the, statement, to, be, true, for, example, it, belongs, to, the, truth, conditions, of, the, sentence, it, is, raining, outside, that, raindrops, are, falling, from, the, sky, the, sentence, is, true, if, it, is, used, in, a, situation, in, which, the, truth, conditions, are, fulfilled, i, e, if, there, is, actually, rain, outside, truth, conditions, play, a, central, role, in, semantics, and, some, theories, rely, exclusively, on, truth, conditions, to, analyze, meaning, to, understand, a, statement, usually, implies, that, one, has, an, idea, about, the, conditions, under, which, it, would, be, true, this, can, happen, even, if, one, does, not, know, whether, the, conditions, are, fulfilled, the, semiotic, triangle, also, called, the, triangle, of, meaning, is, a, model, used, to, explain, the, relation, between, language, language, users, and, the, world, represented, in, the, model, as, symbol, thought, or, reference, and, referent, the, symbol, is, a, linguistic, signifier, either, in, its, spoken, or, written, form, the, central, idea, of, the, model, is, that, there, is, no, direct, relation, between, a, linguistic, expression, and, what, it, refers, to, as, was, assumed, by, earlier, dyadic, models, this, is, expressed, in, the, diagram, by, the, dotted, line, between, symbol, and, referent, the, model, holds, instead, that, the, relation, between, the, two, is, mediated, through, a, third, component, for, example, the, term, apple, stands, for, a, type, of, fruit, but, there, is, no, direct, connection, between, this, string, of, letters, and, the, corresponding, physical, object, the, relation, is, only, established, indirectly, through, the, mind, of, the, language, user, when, they, see, the, symbol, it, evokes, a, mental, image, or, a, concept, which, establishes, the, connection, to, the, physical, object, this, process, is, only, possible, if, the, language, user, learned, the, meaning, of, the, symbol, before, the, meaning, of, a, specific, symbol, is, governed, by, the, conventions, of, a, particular, language, the, same, symbol, may, refer, to, one, object, in, one, language, to, another, object, in, a, different, language, and, to, no, object, in, another, language, many, other, concepts, are, used, to, describe, semantic, phenomena, the, semantic, role, of, an, expression, is, the, function, it, fulfills, in, a, sentence, in, the, sentence, the, boy, kicked, the, ball, the, boy, has, the, role, of, the, agent, who, performs, an, action, the, ball, is, the, theme, or, patient, of, this, action, as, something, that, does, not, act, itself, but, is, involved, in, or, affected, by, the, action, the, same, entity, can, be, both, agent, and, patient, like, when, someone, cuts, themselves, an, entity, has, the, semantic, role, of, an, instrument, if, it, is, used, to, perform, the, action, for, instance, when, cutting, something, with, a, knife, then, the, knife, is, the, instrument, for, some, sentences, no, action, is, described, but, an, experience, takes, place, like, when, a, girl, sees, a, bird, in, this, case, the, girl, has, the, role, of, the, experiencer, other, common, semantic, roles, are, location, source, goal, beneficiary, and, stimulus, lexical, relations, describe, how, words, stand, to, one, another, two, words, are, synonyms, if, they, share, the, same, or, a, very, similar, meaning, like, car, and, automobile, or, buy, and, purchase, antonyms, have, opposite, meanings, such, as, the, contrast, between, alive, and, dead, or, fast, and, slow, one, term, is, a, hyponym, of, another, term, if, the, meaning, of, the, first, term, is, included, in, the, meaning, of, the, second, term, for, example, ant, is, a, hyponym, of, insect, a, prototype, is, a, hyponym, that, has, characteristic, features, of, the, type, it, belongs, to, a, robin, is, a, prototype, of, a, bird, but, a, penguin, is, not, two, words, with, the, same, pronunciation, are, homophones, like, flour, and, flower, while, two, words, with, the, same, spelling, are, homonyms, like, a, bank, of, a, river, in, contrast, to, a, bank, as, a, financial, institution, hyponymy, is, closely, related, to, meronymy, which, describes, the, relation, between, part, and, whole, for, instance, wheel, is, a, meronym, of, car, an, expression, is, ambiguous, if, it, has, more, than, one, possible, meaning, in, some, cases, it, is, possible, to, disambiguate, them, to, discern, the, intended, meaning, the, term, polysemy, is, used, if, the, different, meanings, are, closely, related, to, one, another, like, the, meanings, of, the, word, head, which, can, refer, to, the, topmost, part, of, the, human, body, or, the, top, ranking, person, in, an, organization, the, meaning, of, words, can, often, be, subdivided, into, meaning, components, called, semantic, features, the, word, horse, has, the, semantic, feature, animate, but, lacks, the, semantic, feature, human, it, may, not, always, be, possible, to, fully, reconstruct, the, meaning, of, a, word, by, identifying, all, its, semantic, features, a, semantic, or, lexical, field, is, a, group, of, words, that, are, all, related, to, the, same, activity, or, subject, for, instance, the, semantic, field, of, cooking, includes, words, like, bake, boil, spice, and, pan, the, context, of, an, expression, refers, to, the, situation, or, circumstances, in, which, it, is, used, and, includes, time, location, speaker, and, audience, it, also, encompasses, other, passages, in, a, text, that, come, before, and, after, it, context, affects, the, meaning, of, various, expressions, like, the, deictic, expression, here, and, the, anaphoric, expression, she, a, syntactic, environment, is, extensional, or, transparent, if, it, is, always, possible, to, exchange, expressions, with, the, same, reference, without, affecting, the, truth, value, of, the, sentence, for, example, the, environment, of, the, sentence, the, number, 8, is, even, is, extensional, because, replacing, the, expression, the, number, 8, with, the, number, of, planets, in, the, solar, system, does, not, change, its, truth, value, for, intensional, or, opaque, contexts, this, type, of, substitution, is, not, always, possible, for, instance, the, embedded, clause, in, paco, believes, that, the, number, 8, is, even, is, intensional, since, paco, may, not, know, that, the, number, of, planets, in, the, solar, system, is, 8, semanticists, commonly, distinguish, the, language, they, study, called, object, language, from, the, language, they, use, to, express, their, findings, called, metalanguage, when, a, professor, uses, japanese, to, teach, their, student, how, to, interpret, the, language, of, first, order, logic, then, the, language, of, first, order, logic, is, the, object, language, and, japanese, is, the, metalanguage, the, same, language, may, occupy, the, role, of, object, language, and, metalanguage, at, the, same, time, this, is, the, case, in, monolingual, english, dictionaries, in, which, both, the, entry, term, belonging, to, the, object, language, and, the, definition, text, belonging, to, the, metalanguage, are, taken, from, the, english, language, lexical, semantics, is, the, sub, field, of, semantics, that, studies, word, meaning, it, examines, semantic, aspects, of, individual, words, and, the, vocabulary, as, a, whole, this, includes, the, study, of, lexical, relations, between, words, such, as, whether, two, terms, are, synonyms, or, antonyms, lexical, semantics, categorizes, words, based, on, semantic, features, they, share, and, groups, them, into, semantic, fields, unified, by, a, common, subject, this, information, is, used, to, create, taxonomies, to, organize, lexical, knowledge, for, example, by, distinguishing, between, physical, and, abstract, entities, and, subdividing, physical, entities, into, stuff, and, individuated, entities, further, topics, of, interest, are, polysemy, ambiguity, and, vagueness, lexical, semantics, is, sometimes, divided, into, two, complementary, approaches, semasiology, and, onomasiology, semasiology, starts, from, words, and, examines, what, their, meaning, is, it, is, interested, in, whether, words, have, one, or, several, meanings, and, how, those, meanings, are, related, to, one, another, instead, of, going, from, word, to, meaning, onomasiology, goes, from, meaning, to, word, it, starts, with, a, concept, and, examines, what, names, this, concept, has, or, how, it, can, be, expressed, in, a, particular, language, some, semanticists, also, include, the, study, of, lexical, units, other, than, words, in, the, field, of, lexical, semantics, compound, expressions, like, being, under, the, weather, have, a, non, literal, meaning, that, acts, as, a, unit, and, is, not, a, direct, function, of, its, parts, another, topic, concerns, the, meaning, of, morphemes, that, make, up, words, for, instance, how, negative, prefixes, like, in, and, dis, affect, the, meaning, of, the, words, they, are, part, of, as, in, inanimate, and, dishonest, phrasal, semantics, studies, the, meaning, of, sentences, it, relies, on, the, principle, of, compositionality, to, explore, how, the, meaning, of, complex, expressions, arises, from, the, combination, of, their, parts, the, different, parts, can, be, analyzed, as, subject, predicate, or, argument, the, subject, of, a, sentence, usually, refers, to, a, specific, entity, while, the, predicate, describes, a, feature, of, the, subject, or, an, event, in, which, the, subject, participates, arguments, provide, additional, information, to, complete, the, predicate, for, example, in, the, sentence, mary, hit, the, ball, mary, is, the, subject, hit, is, the, predicate, and, the, ball, is, an, argument, a, more, fine, grained, categorization, distinguishes, between, different, semantic, roles, of, words, such, as, agent, patient, theme, location, source, and, goal, verbs, usually, function, as, predicates, and, often, help, to, establish, connections, between, different, expressions, to, form, a, more, complex, meaning, structure, in, the, expression, beethoven, likes, schubert, the, verb, like, connects, a, liker, to, the, object, of, their, liking, other, sentence, parts, modify, meaning, rather, than, form, new, connections, for, instance, the, adjective, red, modifies, the, color, of, another, entity, in, the, expression, red, car, a, further, compositional, device, is, variable, binding, which, is, used, to, determine, the, reference, of, a, term, for, example, the, last, part, of, the, expression, the, woman, who, likes, beethoven, specifies, which, woman, is, meant, parse, trees, can, be, used, to, show, the, underlying, hierarchy, employed, to, combine, the, different, parts, various, grammatical, devices, like, the, gerund, form, also, contribute, to, meaning, and, are, studied, by, grammatical, semantics, formal, semantics, uses, formal, tools, from, logic, and, mathematics, to, analyze, meaning, in, natural, languages, it, aims, to, develop, precise, logical, formalisms, to, clarify, the, relation, between, expressions, and, their, denotation, one, of, its, key, tasks, is, to, provide, frameworks, of, how, language, represents, the, world, for, example, using, ontological, models, to, show, how, linguistic, expressions, map, to, the, entities, of, that, model, a, common, idea, is, that, words, refer, to, individual, objects, or, groups, of, objects, while, sentences, relate, to, events, and, states, sentences, are, mapped, to, a, truth, value, based, on, whether, their, description, of, the, world, is, in, correspondence, with, its, ontological, model, formal, semantics, further, examines, how, to, use, formal, mechanisms, to, represent, linguistic, phenomena, such, as, quantification, intensionality, noun, phrases, plurals, mass, terms, tense, and, modality, montague, semantics, is, an, early, and, influential, theory, in, formal, semantics, that, provides, a, detailed, analysis, of, how, the, english, language, can, be, represented, using, mathematical, logic, it, relies, on, higher, order, logic, lambda, calculus, and, type, theory, to, show, how, meaning, is, created, through, the, combination, of, expressions, belonging, to, different, syntactic, categories, dynamic, semantics, is, a, subfield, of, formal, semantics, that, focuses, on, how, information, grows, over, time, according, to, it, meaning, is, context, change, potential, the, meaning, of, a, sentence, is, not, given, by, the, information, it, contains, but, by, the, information, change, it, brings, about, relative, to, a, context, cognitive, semantics, studies, the, problem, of, meaning, from, a, psychological, perspective, or, how, the, mind, of, the, language, user, affects, meaning, as, a, subdiscipline, of, cognitive, linguistics, it, sees, language, as, a, wide, cognitive, ability, that, is, closely, related, to, the, conceptual, structures, used, to, understand, and, represent, the, world, cognitive, semanticists, do, not, draw, a, sharp, distinction, between, linguistic, knowledge, and, knowledge, of, the, world, and, see, them, instead, as, interrelated, phenomena, they, study, how, the, interaction, between, language, and, human, cognition, affects, the, conceptual, organization, in, very, general, domains, like, space, time, causation, and, action, the, contrast, between, profile, and, base, is, sometimes, used, to, articulate, the, underlying, knowledge, structure, the, profile, of, a, linguistic, expression, is, the, aspect, of, the, knowledge, structure, that, it, brings, to, the, foreground, while, the, base, is, the, background, that, provides, the, context, of, this, aspect, without, being, at, the, center, of, attention, for, example, the, profile, of, the, word, hypotenuse, is, a, straight, line, while, the, base, is, a, right, angled, triangle, of, which, the, hypotenuse, forms, a, part, cognitive, semantics, further, compares, the, conceptual, patterns, and, linguistic, typologies, across, languages, and, considers, to, what, extent, the, cognitive, conceptual, structures, of, humans, are, universal, or, relative, to, their, linguistic, background, another, research, topic, concerns, the, psychological, processes, involved, in, the, application, of, grammar, other, investigated, phenomena, include, categorization, which, is, understood, as, a, cognitive, heuristic, to, avoid, information, overload, by, regarding, different, entities, in, the, same, way, and, embodiment, which, concerns, how, the, language, user, s, bodily, experience, affects, the, meaning, of, expressions, frame, semantics, is, an, important, subfield, of, cognitive, semantics, its, central, idea, is, that, the, meaning, of, terms, cannot, be, understood, in, isolation, from, each, other, but, needs, to, be, analyzed, on, the, background, of, the, conceptual, structures, they, depend, on, these, structures, are, made, explicit, in, terms, of, semantic, frames, for, example, words, like, bride, groom, and, honeymoon, evoke, in, the, mind, the, frame, of, marriage, conceptual, semantics, shares, with, cognitive, semantics, the, idea, of, studying, linguistic, meaning, from, a, psychological, perspective, by, examining, how, humans, conceptualize, and, experience, the, world, it, holds, that, meaning, is, not, about, the, objects, to, which, expressions, refer, but, about, the, cognitive, structure, of, human, concepts, that, connect, thought, perception, and, action, conceptual, semantics, differs, from, cognitive, semantics, by, introducing, a, strict, distinction, between, meaning, and, syntax, and, by, relying, on, various, formal, devices, to, explore, the, relation, between, meaning, and, cognition, computational, semantics, examines, how, the, meaning, of, natural, language, expressions, can, be, represented, and, processed, on, computers, it, often, relies, on, the, insights, of, formal, semantics, and, applies, them, to, problems, that, can, be, computationally, solved, some, of, its, key, problems, include, computing, the, meaning, of, complex, expressions, by, analyzing, their, parts, handling, ambiguity, vagueness, and, context, dependence, and, using, the, extracted, information, in, automatic, reasoning, it, forms, part, of, computational, linguistics, artificial, intelligence, and, cognitive, science, its, applications, include, machine, learning, and, machine, translation, cultural, semantics, studies, the, relation, between, linguistic, meaning, and, culture, it, compares, conceptual, structures, in, different, languages, and, is, interested, in, how, meanings, evolve, and, change, because, of, cultural, phenomena, associated, with, politics, religion, and, customs, for, example, address, practices, encode, cultural, values, and, social, hierarchies, as, in, the, difference, of, politeness, of, expressions, like, tu, and, usted, in, spanish, or, du, and, sie, in, german, in, contrast, to, english, which, lacks, these, distinctions, and, uses, the, pronoun, you, in, either, case, closely, related, fields, are, intercultural, semantics, cross, cultural, semantics, and, comparative, semantics, pragmatic, semantics, studies, how, the, meaning, of, an, expression, is, shaped, by, the, situation, in, which, it, is, used, it, is, based, on, the, idea, that, communicative, meaning, is, usually, context, sensitive, and, depends, on, who, participates, in, the, exchange, what, information, they, share, and, what, their, intentions, and, background, assumptions, are, it, focuses, on, communicative, actions, of, which, linguistic, expressions, only, form, one, part, some, theorists, include, these, topics, within, the, scope, of, semantics, while, others, consider, them, part, of, the, distinct, discipline, of, pragmatics, theories, of, meaning, explain, what, meaning, is, what, meaning, an, expression, has, and, how, the, relation, between, expression, and, meaning, is, established, referential, theories, state, that, the, meaning, of, an, expression, is, the, entity, to, which, it, points, the, meaning, of, singular, terms, like, names, is, the, individual, to, which, they, refer, for, example, the, meaning, of, the, name, george, washington, is, the, person, with, this, name, general, terms, refer, not, to, a, single, entity, but, to, the, set, of, objects, to, which, this, term, applies, in, this, regard, the, meaning, of, the, term, cat, is, the, set, of, all, cats, similarly, verbs, usually, refer, to, classes, of, actions, or, events, and, adjectives, refer, to, properties, of, individuals, and, events, simple, referential, theories, face, problems, for, meaningful, expressions, that, have, no, clear, referent, names, like, pegasus, and, santa, claus, have, meaning, even, though, they, do, not, point, to, existing, entities, other, difficulties, concern, cases, in, which, different, expressions, are, about, the, same, entity, for, instance, the, expressions, roger, bannister, and, the, first, man, to, run, a, four, minute, mile, refer, to, the, same, person, but, do, not, mean, exactly, the, same, thing, this, is, particularly, relevant, when, talking, about, beliefs, since, a, person, may, understand, both, expressions, without, knowing, that, they, point, to, the, same, entity, a, further, problem, is, given, by, expressions, whose, meaning, depends, on, the, context, like, the, deictic, terms, here, and, i, to, avoid, these, problems, referential, theories, often, introduce, additional, devices, some, identify, meaning, not, directly, with, objects, but, with, functions, that, point, to, objects, this, additional, level, has, the, advantage, of, taking, the, context, of, an, expression, into, account, since, the, same, expression, may, point, to, one, object, in, one, context, and, to, another, object, in, a, different, context, for, example, the, reference, of, the, word, here, depends, on, the, location, in, which, it, is, used, a, closely, related, approach, is, possible, world, semantics, which, allows, expressions, to, refer, not, only, to, entities, in, the, actual, world, but, also, to, entities, in, other, possible, worlds, according, to, this, view, expressions, like, the, first, man, to, run, a, four, minute, mile, refer, to, different, persons, in, different, worlds, this, view, can, also, be, used, to, analyze, sentences, that, talk, about, what, is, possible, or, what, is, necessary, possibility, is, what, is, true, in, some, possible, worlds, while, necessity, is, what, is, true, in, all, possible, worlds, ideational, theories, also, called, mentalist, theories, are, not, primarily, interested, in, the, reference, of, expressions, and, instead, explain, meaning, in, terms, of, the, mental, states, of, language, users, one, historically, influential, approach, articulated, by, john, locke, holds, that, expressions, stand, for, ideas, in, the, speaker, s, mind, according, to, this, view, the, meaning, of, the, word, dog, is, the, idea, that, people, have, of, dogs, language, is, seen, as, a, medium, used, to, transfer, ideas, from, the, speaker, to, the, audience, after, having, learned, the, same, meaning, of, signs, the, speaker, can, produce, a, sign, that, corresponds, to, the, idea, in, their, mind, and, the, perception, of, this, sign, evokes, the, same, idea, in, the, mind, of, the, audience, a, closely, related, theory, focuses, not, directly, on, ideas, but, on, intentions, this, view, is, particularly, associated, with, paul, grice, who, observed, that, people, usually, communicate, to, cause, some, reaction, in, their, audience, he, held, that, the, meaning, of, an, expression, is, given, by, the, intended, reaction, this, means, that, communication, is, not, just, about, decoding, what, the, speaker, literally, said, but, requires, an, understanding, of, their, intention, or, why, they, said, it, for, example, telling, someone, looking, for, petrol, that, there, is, a, garage, around, the, corner, has, the, meaning, that, petrol, can, be, obtained, there, because, of, the, speaker, s, intention, to, help, this, goes, beyond, the, literal, meaning, which, has, no, explicit, connection, to, petrol, causal, theories, hold, that, the, meaning, of, an, expression, depends, on, the, causes, and, effects, it, has, according, to, behaviorist, semantics, also, referred, to, as, stimulus, response, theory, the, meaning, of, an, expression, is, given, by, the, situation, that, prompts, the, speaker, to, use, it, and, the, response, it, provokes, in, the, audience, for, instance, the, meaning, of, yelling, fire, is, given, by, the, presence, of, an, uncontrolled, fire, and, attempts, to, control, it, or, seek, safety, behaviorist, semantics, relies, on, the, idea, that, learning, a, language, consists, in, adopting, behavioral, patterns, in, the, form, of, stimulus, response, pairs, one, of, its, key, motivations, is, to, avoid, private, mental, entities, and, define, meaning, instead, in, terms, of, publicly, observable, language, behavior, another, causal, theory, focuses, on, the, meaning, of, names, and, holds, that, a, naming, event, is, required, to, establish, the, link, between, name, and, named, entity, this, naming, event, acts, as, a, form, of, baptism, that, establishes, the, first, link, of, a, causal, chain, in, which, all, subsequent, uses, of, the, name, participate, according, to, this, view, the, name, plato, refers, to, an, ancient, greek, philosopher, because, at, some, point, he, was, originally, named, this, way, and, people, kept, using, this, name, to, refer, to, him, this, view, was, originally, formulated, by, saul, kripke, to, apply, to, names, only, but, has, been, extended, to, cover, other, types, of, speech, as, well, truth, conditional, semantics, analyzes, the, meaning, of, sentences, in, terms, of, their, truth, conditions, according, to, this, view, to, understand, a, sentence, means, to, know, what, the, world, needs, to, be, like, for, the, sentence, to, be, true, truth, conditions, can, themselves, be, expressed, through, possible, worlds, for, example, the, sentence, hillary, clinton, won, the, 2016, american, presidential, election, is, false, in, the, actual, world, but, there, are, some, possible, worlds, in, which, it, is, true, the, extension, of, a, sentence, can, be, interpreted, as, its, truth, value, while, its, intension, is, the, set, of, all, possible, worlds, in, which, it, is, true, truth, conditional, semantics, is, closely, related, to, verificationist, theories, which, introduce, the, additional, idea, that, there, should, be, some, kind, of, verification, procedure, to, assess, whether, a, sentence, is, true, they, state, that, the, meaning, of, a, sentence, consists, in, the, method, to, verify, it, or, in, the, circumstances, that, justify, it, for, instance, scientific, claims, often, make, predictions, which, can, be, used, to, confirm, or, disconfirm, them, using, observation, according, to, verificationism, sentences, that, can, neither, be, verified, nor, falsified, are, meaningless, the, use, theory, states, that, the, meaning, of, an, expression, is, given, by, the, way, it, is, utilized, this, view, was, first, introduced, by, ludwig, wittgenstein, who, understood, language, as, a, collection, of, language, games, the, meaning, of, expressions, depends, on, how, they, are, used, inside, a, game, and, the, same, expression, may, have, different, meanings, in, different, games, some, versions, of, this, theory, identify, meaning, directly, with, patterns, of, regular, use, others, focus, on, social, norms, and, conventions, by, additionally, taking, into, account, whether, a, certain, use, is, considered, appropriate, in, a, given, society, inferentialist, semantics, also, called, conceptual, role, semantics, holds, that, the, meaning, of, an, expression, is, given, by, the, role, it, plays, in, the, premises, and, conclusions, of, good, inferences, for, example, one, can, infer, from, x, is, a, male, sibling, that, x, is, a, brother, and, one, can, infer, from, x, is, a, brother, that, x, has, parents, according, to, inferentialist, semantics, the, meaning, of, the, word, brother, is, determined, by, these, and, all, similar, inferences, that, can, be, drawn, semantics, was, established, as, an, independent, field, of, inquiry, in, the, 19th, century, but, the, study, of, semantic, phenomena, began, as, early, as, the, ancient, period, as, part, of, philosophy, and, logic, in, ancient, greece, plato, 427, 347, bce, explored, the, relation, between, names, and, things, in, his, dialogue, cratylus, it, considers, the, positions, of, naturalism, which, holds, that, things, have, their, name, by, nature, and, conventionalism, which, states, that, names, are, related, to, their, referents, by, customs, and, conventions, among, language, users, the, book, on, interpretation, by, aristotle, 384, 322, bce, introduced, various, conceptual, distinctions, that, greatly, influenced, subsequent, works, in, semantics, he, developed, an, early, form, of, the, semantic, triangle, by, holding, that, spoken, and, written, words, evoke, mental, concepts, which, refer, to, external, things, by, resembling, them, for, him, mental, concepts, are, the, same, for, all, humans, unlike, the, conventional, words, they, associate, with, those, concepts, the, stoics, incorporated, many, of, the, insights, of, their, predecessors, to, develop, a, complex, theory, of, language, through, the, perspective, of, logic, they, discerned, different, kinds, of, words, by, their, semantic, and, syntactic, roles, such, as, the, contrast, between, names, common, nouns, and, verbs, they, also, discussed, the, difference, between, statements, commands, and, prohibitions, in, ancient, india, the, orthodox, school, of, nyaya, held, that, all, names, refer, to, real, objects, it, explored, how, words, lead, to, an, understanding, of, the, thing, meant, and, what, consequence, this, relation, has, to, the, creation, of, knowledge, philosophers, of, the, orthodox, school, of, m, m, s, discussed, the, relation, between, the, meanings, of, individual, words, and, full, sentences, while, considering, which, one, is, more, basic, the, book, v, kyapad, ya, by, bhart, hari, 4th, 5th, century, ce, distinguished, between, different, types, of, words, and, considered, how, they, can, carry, different, meanings, depending, on, how, they, are, used, in, ancient, china, the, mohists, argued, that, names, play, a, key, role, in, making, distinctions, to, guide, moral, behavior, they, inspired, the, school, of, names, which, explored, the, relation, between, names, and, entities, while, examining, how, names, are, required, to, identify, and, judge, entities, in, the, middle, ages, augustine, of, hippo, 354, 430, developed, a, general, conception, of, signs, as, entities, that, stand, for, other, entities, and, convey, them, to, the, intellect, he, was, the, first, to, introduce, the, distinction, between, natural, and, linguistic, signs, as, different, types, belonging, to, a, common, genus, boethius, 480, 528, wrote, a, translation, of, and, various, comments, on, aristotle, s, book, on, interpretation, which, popularized, its, main, ideas, and, inspired, reflections, on, semantic, phenomena, in, the, scholastic, tradition, an, innovation, in, the, semantics, of, peter, abelard, 1079, 1142, was, his, interest, in, propositions, or, the, meaning, of, sentences, in, contrast, to, the, focus, on, the, meaning, of, individual, words, by, many, of, his, predecessors, he, further, explored, the, nature, of, universals, which, he, understood, as, mere, semantic, phenomena, of, common, names, caused, by, mental, abstractions, that, do, not, refer, to, any, entities, in, the, arabic, tradition, ibn, faris, 920, 1004, identified, meaning, with, the, intention, of, the, speaker, while, abu, mansur, al, azhari, 895, 980, held, that, meaning, resides, directly, in, speech, and, needs, to, be, extracted, through, interpretation, an, important, topic, towards, the, end, of, the, middle, ages, was, the, distinction, between, categorematic, and, syncategorematic, terms, categorematic, terms, have, an, independent, meaning, and, refer, to, some, part, of, reality, like, horse, and, socrates, syncategorematic, terms, lack, independent, meaning, and, fulfill, other, semantic, functions, such, as, modifying, or, quantifying, the, meaning, of, other, expressions, like, the, words, some, not, and, necessarily, an, early, version, of, the, causal, theory, of, meaning, was, proposed, by, roger, bacon, c, 1219, 20, c, 1292, who, held, that, things, get, names, similar, to, how, people, get, names, through, some, kind, of, initial, baptism, his, ideas, inspired, the, tradition, of, the, speculative, grammarians, who, proposed, that, there, are, certain, universal, structures, found, in, all, languages, they, arrived, at, this, conclusion, by, drawing, an, analogy, between, the, modes, of, signification, on, the, level, of, language, the, modes, of, understanding, on, the, level, of, mind, and, the, modes, of, being, on, the, level, of, reality, in, the, early, modern, period, thomas, hobbes, 1588, 1679, distinguished, between, marks, which, people, use, privately, to, recall, their, own, thoughts, and, signs, which, are, used, publicly, to, communicate, their, ideas, to, others, in, their, port, royal, logic, antoine, arnauld, 1612, 1694, and, pierre, nicole, 1625, 1695, developed, an, early, precursor, of, the, distinction, between, intension, and, extension, the, essay, concerning, human, understanding, by, john, locke, 1632, 1704, presented, an, influential, version, of, the, ideational, theory, of, meaning, according, to, which, words, stand, for, ideas, and, help, people, communicate, by, transferring, ideas, from, one, mind, to, another, gottfried, wilhelm, leibniz, 1646, 1716, understood, language, as, the, mirror, of, thought, and, tried, to, conceive, the, outlines, of, a, universal, formal, language, to, express, scientific, and, philosophical, truths, this, attempt, inspired, theorists, christian, wolff, 1679, 1754, georg, bernhard, bilfinger, 1693, 1750, and, johann, heinrich, lambert, 1728, 1777, to, develop, the, idea, of, a, general, science, of, sign, systems, tienne, bonnot, de, condillac, 1715, 1780, accepted, and, further, developed, leibniz, s, idea, of, the, linguistic, nature, of, thought, against, locke, he, held, that, language, is, involved, in, the, creation, of, ideas, and, is, not, merely, a, medium, to, communicate, them, in, the, 19th, century, semantics, emerged, and, solidified, as, an, independent, field, of, inquiry, christian, karl, reisig, 1792, 1829, is, sometimes, credited, as, the, father, of, semantics, since, he, clarified, its, concept, and, scope, while, also, making, various, contributions, to, its, key, ideas, michel, br, al, 1832, 1915, followed, him, in, providing, a, broad, conception, of, the, field, for, which, he, coined, the, french, term, semantique, john, stuart, mill, 1806, 1873, gave, great, importance, to, the, role, of, names, to, refer, to, things, he, distinguished, between, the, connotation, and, denotation, of, names, and, held, that, propositions, are, formed, by, combining, names, charles, sanders, peirce, 1839, 1914, conceived, semiotics, as, a, general, theory, of, signs, with, several, subdisciplines, which, were, later, identified, by, charles, w, morris, 1901, 1979, as, syntactics, semantics, and, pragmatics, in, his, pragmatist, approach, to, semantics, peirce, held, that, the, meaning, of, conceptions, consists, in, the, entirety, of, their, practical, consequences, the, philosophy, of, gottlob, frege, 1848, 1925, contributed, to, semantics, on, many, different, levels, frege, first, introduced, the, distinction, between, sense, and, reference, and, his, development, of, predicate, logic, and, the, principle, of, compositionality, formed, the, foundation, of, many, subsequent, developments, in, formal, semantics, edmund, husserl, 1859, 1938, explored, meaning, from, a, phenomenological, perspective, by, considering, the, mental, acts, that, endow, expressions, with, meaning, he, held, that, meaning, always, implies, reference, to, an, object, and, expressions, that, lack, a, referent, like, green, is, or, are, meaningless, in, the, 20th, century, alfred, tarski, 1901, 1983, defined, truth, in, formal, languages, through, his, semantic, theory, of, truth, which, was, influential, in, the, development, of, truth, conditional, semantics, by, donald, davidson, 1917, 2003, tarski, s, student, richard, montague, 1930, 1971, formulated, a, complex, formal, framework, of, the, semantics, of, the, english, language, which, was, responsible, for, establishing, formal, semantics, as, a, major, area, of, research, according, to, structural, semantics, which, was, inspired, by, the, structuralist, philosophy, of, ferdinand, de, saussure, 1857, 1913, language, is, a, complex, network, of, structural, relations, and, the, meanings, of, words, are, not, fixed, individually, but, depend, on, their, position, within, this, network, the, theory, of, general, semantics, was, developed, by, alfred, korzybski, 1879, 1950, as, an, inquiry, into, how, language, represents, reality, and, affects, human, thought, the, contributions, of, george, lakoff, 1941, present, and, ronald, langacker, 1942, present, provided, the, foundation, of, cognitive, semantics, charles, j, fillmore, 1929, 2014, developed, frame, semantics, as, a, major, approach, in, this, area, the, closely, related, field, of, conceptual, semantics, was, inaugurated, by, ray, jackendoff, 1945, present, logicians, study, correct, reasoning, and, often, develop, formal, languages, to, express, arguments, and, assess, their, correctness, one, part, of, this, process, is, to, provide, a, semantics, for, a, formal, language, to, precisely, define, what, its, terms, mean, a, semantics, of, a, formal, language, is, a, set, of, rules, usually, expressed, as, a, mathematical, function, that, assigns, meanings, to, formal, language, expressions, for, example, the, language, of, first, order, logic, uses, lowercase, letters, for, individual, constants, and, uppercase, letters, for, predicates, to, express, the, sentence, bertie, is, a, dog, the, formula, d, b, displaystyle, d, b, can, be, used, where, b, displaystyle, b, is, an, individual, constant, for, bertie, and, d, displaystyle, d, is, a, predicate, for, dog, classical, model, theoretic, semantics, assigns, meaning, to, these, terms, by, defining, an, interpretation, function, that, maps, individual, constants, to, specific, objects, and, predicates, to, sets, of, objects, or, tuples, the, function, maps, b, displaystyle, b, to, bertie, and, d, displaystyle, d, to, the, set, of, all, dogs, this, way, it, is, possible, to, calculate, the, truth, value, of, the, sentence, it, is, true, if, bertie, is, a, member, of, the, set, of, dogs, and, false, otherwise, formal, logic, aims, to, determine, whether, arguments, are, deductively, valid, that, is, whether, the, premises, entail, the, conclusion, entailment, can, be, defined, in, terms, of, syntax, or, in, terms, of, semantics, syntactic, entailment, expressed, with, the, symbol, displaystyle, vdash, relies, on, rules, of, inference, which, can, be, understood, as, procedures, to, transform, premises, and, arrive, at, a, conclusion, these, procedures, only, take, the, logical, form, of, the, premises, on, the, level, of, syntax, into, account, and, ignore, what, meaning, they, express, semantic, entailment, expressed, with, the, symbol, displaystyle, vdash, looks, at, the, meaning, of, the, premises, in, particular, at, their, truth, value, a, conclusion, follows, semantically, from, a, set, of, premises, if, the, truth, of, the, premises, ensures, the, truth, of, the, conclusion, that, is, if, any, semantic, interpretation, function, that, assigns, the, premises, the, value, true, also, assigns, the, conclusion, the, value, true, in, computer, science, the, semantics, of, a, program, is, how, it, behaves, when, a, computer, runs, it, semantics, contrasts, with, syntax, which, is, the, particular, form, in, which, instructions, are, expressed, the, same, behavior, can, usually, be, described, with, different, forms, of, syntax, in, javascript, this, is, the, case, for, the, commands, i, 1, and, i, i, 1, which, are, syntactically, different, expressions, to, increase, the, value, of, the, variable, i, by, one, this, difference, is, also, reflected, in, different, programming, languages, since, they, rely, on, different, syntax, but, can, usually, be, employed, to, create, programs, with, the, same, behavior, on, the, semantic, level, static, semantics, focuses, on, semantic, aspects, that, affect, the, compilation, of, a, program, in, particular, it, is, concerned, with, detecting, errors, of, syntactically, correct, programs, such, as, type, errors, which, arise, when, an, operation, receives, an, incompatible, data, type, this, is, the, case, for, instance, if, a, function, performing, a, numerical, calculation, is, given, a, string, instead, of, a, number, as, an, argument, dynamic, semantics, focuses, on, the, run, time, behavior, of, programs, that, is, what, happens, during, the, execution, of, instructions, the, main, approaches, to, dynamic, semantics, are, denotational, axiomatic, and, operational, semantics, denotational, semantics, relies, on, mathematical, formalisms, to, describe, the, effects, of, each, element, of, the, code, axiomatic, semantics, uses, deductive, logic, to, analyze, which, conditions, must, be, in, place, before, and, after, the, execution, of, a, program, operational, semantics, interprets, the, execution, of, a, program, as, a, series, of, steps, each, involving, the, transition, from, one, state, to, another, state, psychological, semantics, examines, psychological, aspects, of, meaning, it, is, concerned, with, how, meaning, is, represented, on, a, cognitive, level, and, what, mental, processes, are, involved, in, understanding, and, producing, language, it, further, investigates, how, meaning, interacts, with, other, mental, processes, such, as, the, relation, between, language, and, perceptual, experience, other, issues, concern, how, people, learn, new, words, and, relate, them, to, familiar, things, and, concepts, how, they, infer, the, meaning, of, compound, expressions, they, have, never, heard, before, how, they, resolve, ambiguous, expressions, and, how, semantic, illusions, lead, them, to, misinterpret, sentences, one, key, topic, is, semantic, memory, which, is, a, form, of, general, knowledge, of, meaning, that, includes, the, knowledge, of, language, concepts, and, facts, it, contrasts, with, episodic, memory, which, records, events, that, a, person, experienced, in, their, life, the, comprehension, of, language, relies, on, semantic, memory, and, the, information, it, carries, about, word, meanings, according, to, a, common, view, word, meanings, are, stored, and, processed, in, relation, to, their, semantic, features, the, feature, comparison, model, states, that, sentences, like, a, robin, is, a, bird, are, assessed, on, a, psychological, level, by, comparing, the, semantic, features, of, the, word, robin, with, the, semantic, features, of, the, word, bird, the, assessment, process, is, fast, if, their, semantic, features, are, similar, which, is, the, case, if, the, example, is, a, prototype, of, the, general, category, for, atypical, examples, as, in, the, sentence, a, penguin, is, a, bird, there, is, less, overlap, in, the, semantic, features, and, the, psychological, process, is, significantly, slower
