https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralization
decentralization, or, decentralisation, is, the, process, by, which, the, activities, of, an, organization, particularly, those, related, to, planning, and, decision, making, are, distributed, or, delegated, away, from, a, central, authoritative, location, or, group, and, given, to, smaller, factions, within, it, concepts, of, decentralization, have, been, applied, to, group, dynamics, and, management, science, in, private, businesses, and, organizations, political, science, law, and, public, administration, technology, economics, and, money, the, word, centralisation, came, into, use, in, france, in, 1794, as, the, post, revolution, french, directory, leadership, created, a, new, government, structure, the, word, d, centralisation, came, into, usage, in, the, 1820s, centralization, entered, written, english, in, the, first, third, of, the, 1800s, mentions, of, decentralization, also, first, appear, during, those, years, in, the, mid, 1800s, tocqueville, would, write, that, the, french, revolution, began, with, a, push, towards, decentralization, but, became, in, the, end, an, extension, of, centralization, in, 1863, retired, french, bureaucrat, maurice, block, wrote, an, article, called, decentralization, for, a, french, journal, that, reviewed, the, dynamics, of, government, and, bureaucratic, centralization, and, recent, french, efforts, at, decentralization, of, government, functions, ideas, of, liberty, and, decentralization, were, carried, to, their, logical, conclusions, during, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, by, anti, state, political, activists, calling, themselves, anarchists, libertarians, and, even, decentralists, tocqueville, was, an, advocate, writing, decentralization, has, not, only, an, administrative, value, but, also, a, civic, dimension, since, it, increases, the, opportunities, for, citizens, to, take, interest, in, public, affairs, it, makes, them, get, accustomed, to, using, freedom, and, from, the, accumulation, of, these, local, active, persnickety, freedoms, is, born, the, most, efficient, counterweight, against, the, claims, of, the, central, government, even, if, it, were, supported, by, an, impersonal, collective, will, pierre, joseph, proudhon, 1809, 1865, influential, anarchist, theorist, wrote, all, my, economic, ideas, as, developed, over, twenty, five, years, can, be, summed, up, in, the, words, agricultural, industrial, federation, all, my, political, ideas, boil, down, to, a, similar, formula, political, federation, or, decentralization, in, the, early, 20th, century, america, s, response, to, the, centralization, of, economic, wealth, and, political, power, was, a, decentralist, movement, it, blamed, large, scale, industrial, production, for, destroying, middle, class, shop, keepers, and, small, manufacturers, and, promoted, increased, property, ownership, and, a, return, to, small, scale, living, the, decentralist, movement, attracted, southern, agrarians, like, robert, penn, warren, as, well, as, journalist, herbert, agar, new, left, and, libertarian, individuals, who, identified, with, social, economic, and, often, political, decentralism, through, the, ensuing, years, included, ralph, borsodi, wendell, berry, paul, goodman, carl, oglesby, karl, hess, donald, livingston, kirkpatrick, sale, author, of, human, scale, murray, bookchin, dorothy, day, senator, mark, o, hatfield, mildred, j, loomis, and, bill, kauffman, leopold, kohr, author, of, the, 1957, book, the, breakdown, of, nations, known, for, its, statement, whenever, something, is, wrong, something, is, too, big, was, a, major, influence, on, e, f, schumacher, author, of, the, 1973, bestseller, small, is, beautiful, a, study, of, economics, as, if, people, mattered, in, the, next, few, years, a, number, of, best, selling, books, promoted, decentralization, daniel, bell, s, the, coming, of, post, industrial, society, discussed, the, need, for, decentralization, and, a, comprehensive, overhaul, of, government, structure, to, find, the, appropriate, size, and, scope, of, units, as, well, as, the, need, to, detach, functions, from, current, state, boundaries, creating, regions, based, on, functions, like, water, transport, education, and, economics, which, might, have, different, overlays, on, the, map, alvin, toffler, published, future, shock, 1970, and, the, third, wave, 1980, discussing, the, books, in, a, later, interview, toffler, said, that, industrial, style, centralized, top, down, bureaucratic, planning, would, be, replaced, by, a, more, open, democratic, decentralized, style, which, he, called, anticipatory, democracy, futurist, john, naisbitt, s, 1982, book, megatrends, was, on, the, new, york, times, best, seller, list, for, more, than, two, years, and, sold, 14, million, copies, naisbitt, s, book, outlines, 10, megatrends, the, fifth, of, which, is, from, centralization, to, decentralization, in, 1996, david, osborne, and, ted, gaebler, had, a, best, selling, book, reinventing, government, proposing, decentralist, public, administration, theories, which, became, labeled, the, new, public, management, stephen, cummings, wrote, that, decentralization, became, a, revolutionary, megatrend, in, the, 1980s, in, 1983, diana, conyers, asked, if, decentralization, was, the, latest, fashion, in, development, administration, cornell, university, s, project, on, restructuring, local, government, states, that, decentralization, refers, to, the, global, trend, of, devolving, responsibilities, to, regional, or, local, governments, robert, j, bennett, s, decentralization, intergovernmental, relations, and, markets, towards, a, post, welfare, agenda, describes, how, after, world, war, ii, governments, pursued, a, centralized, welfarist, policy, of, entitlements, which, now, has, become, a, post, welfare, policy, of, intergovernmental, and, market, based, decentralization, in, 1983, decentralization, was, identified, as, one, of, the, ten, key, values, of, the, green, movement, in, the, united, states, a, 1999, united, nations, development, programme, report, stated, a, large, number, of, developing, and, transitional, countries, have, embarked, on, some, form, of, decentralization, programmes, this, trend, is, coupled, with, a, growing, interest, in, the, role, of, civil, society, and, the, private, sector, as, partners, to, governments, in, seeking, new, ways, of, service, delivery, decentralization, of, governance, and, the, strengthening, of, local, governing, capacity, is, in, part, also, a, function, of, broader, societal, trends, these, include, for, example, the, growing, distrust, of, government, generally, the, spectacular, demise, of, some, of, the, most, centralized, regimes, in, the, world, especially, the, soviet, union, and, the, emerging, separatist, demands, that, seem, to, routinely, pop, up, in, one, or, another, part, of, the, world, the, movement, toward, local, accountability, and, greater, control, over, one, s, destiny, is, however, not, solely, the, result, of, the, negative, attitude, towards, central, government, rather, these, developments, as, we, have, already, noted, are, principally, being, driven, by, a, strong, desire, for, greater, participation, of, citizens, and, private, sector, organizations, in, governance, those, studying, the, goals, and, processes, of, implementing, decentralization, often, use, a, systems, theory, approach, which, according, to, the, united, nations, development, programme, report, applies, to, the, topic, of, decentralization, a, whole, systems, perspective, including, levels, spheres, sectors, and, functions, and, seeing, the, community, level, as, the, entry, point, at, which, holistic, definitions, of, development, goals, are, from, the, people, themselves, and, where, it, is, most, practical, to, support, them, it, involves, seeing, multi, level, frameworks, and, continuous, synergistic, processes, of, interaction, and, iteration, of, cycles, as, critical, for, achieving, wholeness, in, a, decentralized, system, and, for, sustaining, its, development, however, it, has, been, seen, as, part, of, a, systems, approach, norman, johnson, of, los, alamos, national, laboratory, wrote, in, a, 1999, paper, a, decentralized, system, is, where, some, decisions, by, the, agents, are, made, without, centralized, control, or, processing, an, important, property, of, agent, systems, is, the, degree, of, connectivity, or, connectedness, between, the, agents, a, measure, global, flow, of, information, or, influence, if, each, agent, is, connected, exchange, states, or, influence, to, all, other, agents, then, the, system, is, highly, connected, university, of, california, irvine, s, institute, for, software, research, s, pace, project, is, creating, an, architectural, style, for, trust, management, in, decentralized, applications, it, adopted, rohit, khare, s, definition, of, decentralization, a, decentralized, system, is, one, which, requires, multiple, parties, to, make, their, own, independent, decisions, and, applies, it, to, peer, to, peer, software, creation, writing, in, such, a, decentralized, system, there, is, no, single, centralized, authority, that, makes, decisions, on, behalf, of, all, the, parties, instead, each, party, also, called, a, peer, makes, local, autonomous, decisions, towards, its, individual, goals, which, may, possibly, conflict, with, those, of, other, peers, peers, directly, interact, with, each, other, and, share, information, or, provide, service, to, other, peers, an, open, decentralized, system, is, one, in, which, the, entry, of, peers, is, not, regulated, any, peer, can, enter, or, leave, the, system, at, any, time, decentralization, in, any, area, is, a, response, to, the, problems, of, centralized, systems, decentralization, in, government, the, topic, most, studied, has, been, seen, as, a, solution, to, problems, like, economic, decline, government, inability, to, fund, services, and, their, general, decline, in, performance, of, overloaded, services, the, demands, of, minorities, for, a, greater, say, in, local, governance, the, general, weakening, legitimacy, of, the, public, sector, and, global, and, international, pressure, on, countries, with, inefficient, undemocratic, overly, centralized, systems, the, following, four, goals, or, objectives, are, frequently, stated, in, various, analyses, of, decentralization, in, decentralization, the, principle, of, subsidiarity, is, often, invoked, it, holds, that, the, lowest, or, least, centralized, authority, that, is, capable, of, addressing, an, issue, effectively, should, do, so, according, to, one, definition, decentralization, or, decentralizing, governance, refers, to, the, restructuring, or, reorganization, of, authority, so, that, there, is, a, system, of, co, responsibility, between, institutions, of, governance, at, the, central, regional, and, local, levels, according, to, the, principle, of, subsidiarity, thus, increasing, the, overall, quality, and, effectiveness, of, the, system, of, governance, while, increasing, the, authority, and, capacities, of, sub, national, levels, decentralization, is, often, linked, to, concepts, of, participation, in, decision, making, democracy, equality, and, liberty, from, a, higher, authority, decentralization, enhances, the, democratic, voice, theorists, believe, that, local, representative, authorities, with, actual, discretionary, powers, are, the, basis, of, decentralization, that, can, lead, to, local, efficiency, equity, and, development, columbia, university, s, earth, institute, identified, one, of, three, major, trends, relating, to, decentralization, increased, involvement, of, local, jurisdictions, and, civil, society, in, the, management, of, their, affairs, with, new, forms, of, participation, consultation, and, partnerships, decentralization, has, been, described, as, a, counterpoint, to, globalization, removes, decisions, from, the, local, and, national, stage, to, the, global, sphere, of, multi, national, or, non, national, interests, decentralization, brings, decision, making, back, to, the, sub, national, levels, decentralization, strategies, must, account, for, the, interrelations, of, global, regional, national, sub, national, and, local, levels, norman, l, johnson, writes, that, diversity, plays, an, important, role, in, decentralized, systems, like, ecosystems, social, groups, large, organizations, political, systems, diversity, is, defined, to, be, unique, properties, of, entities, agents, or, individuals, that, are, not, shared, by, the, larger, group, population, structure, decentralized, is, defined, as, a, property, of, a, system, where, the, agents, have, some, ability, to, operate, locally, both, decentralization, and, diversity, are, necessary, attributes, to, achieve, the, self, organizing, properties, of, interest, advocates, of, political, decentralization, hold, that, greater, participation, by, better, informed, diverse, interests, in, society, will, lead, to, more, relevant, decisions, than, those, made, only, by, authorities, on, the, national, level, decentralization, has, been, described, as, a, response, to, demands, for, diversity, in, business, decentralization, leads, to, a, management, by, results, philosophy, which, focuses, on, definite, objectives, to, be, achieved, by, unit, results, decentralization, of, government, programs, is, said, to, increase, efficiency, and, effectiveness, due, to, reduction, of, congestion, in, communications, quicker, reaction, to, unanticipated, problems, improved, ability, to, deliver, services, improved, information, about, local, conditions, and, more, support, from, beneficiaries, of, programs, firms, may, prefer, decentralization, because, it, ensures, efficiency, by, making, sure, that, managers, closest, to, the, local, information, make, decisions, and, in, a, more, timely, fashion, that, their, taking, responsibility, frees, upper, management, for, long, term, strategics, rather, than, day, to, day, decision, making, that, managers, have, hands, on, training, to, prepare, them, to, move, up, the, management, hierarchy, that, managers, are, motivated, by, having, the, freedom, to, exercise, their, own, initiative, and, creativity, that, managers, and, divisions, are, encouraged, to, prove, that, they, are, profitable, instead, of, allowing, their, failures, to, be, masked, by, the, overall, profitability, of, the, company, the, same, principles, can, be, applied, to, the, government, decentralization, promises, to, enhance, efficiency, through, both, inter, governmental, competitions, with, market, features, and, fiscal, discipline, which, assigns, tax, and, expenditure, authority, to, the, lowest, level, of, government, possible, it, works, best, where, members, of, the, subnational, government, have, strong, traditions, of, democracy, accountability, and, professionalism, economic, and, or, political, decentralization, can, help, prevent, or, reduce, conflict, because, they, reduce, actual, or, perceived, inequities, between, various, regions, or, between, a, region, and, the, central, government, dawn, brancati, finds, that, political, decentralization, reduces, intrastate, conflict, unless, politicians, create, political, parties, that, mobilize, minority, and, even, extremist, groups, to, demand, more, resources, and, power, within, national, governments, however, the, likelihood, this, will, be, done, depends, on, factors, like, how, democratic, transitions, happen, and, features, like, a, regional, party, s, proportion, of, legislative, seats, a, country, s, number, of, regional, legislatures, elector, procedures, and, the, order, in, which, national, and, regional, elections, occur, brancati, holds, that, decentralization, can, promote, peace, if, it, encourages, statewide, parties, to, incorporate, regional, demands, and, limit, the, power, of, regional, parties, the, processes, by, which, entities, move, from, a, more, to, a, less, centralized, state, vary, they, can, be, initiated, from, the, centers, of, authority, top, down, or, from, individuals, localities, or, regions, bottom, up, or, from, a, mutually, desired, combination, of, authorities, and, localities, working, together, bottom, up, decentralization, usually, stresses, political, values, like, local, responsiveness, and, increased, participation, and, tends, to, increase, political, stability, top, down, decentralization, may, be, motivated, by, the, desire, to, shift, deficits, downwards, and, find, more, resources, to, pay, for, services, or, pay, off, government, debt, some, hold, that, decentralization, should, not, be, imposed, but, done, in, a, respectful, manner, gauging, the, appropriate, size, or, scale, of, decentralized, units, has, been, studied, in, relation, to, the, size, of, sub, units, of, hospitals, and, schools, road, networks, administrative, units, in, business, and, public, administration, and, especially, town, and, city, governmental, areas, and, decision, making, bodies, in, creating, planned, communities, new, towns, it, is, important, to, determine, the, appropriate, population, and, geographical, size, while, in, earlier, years, small, towns, were, considered, appropriate, by, the, 1960s, 60, 000, inhabitants, was, considered, the, size, necessary, to, support, a, diversified, job, market, and, an, adequate, shopping, center, and, array, of, services, and, entertainment, appropriate, size, of, governmental, units, for, revenue, raising, also, is, a, consideration, even, in, bioregionalism, which, seeks, to, reorder, many, functions, and, even, the, boundaries, of, governments, according, to, physical, and, environmental, features, including, watershed, boundaries, and, soil, and, terrain, characteristics, appropriate, size, must, be, considered, the, unit, may, be, larger, than, many, decentralist, bioregionalists, prefer, decentralization, ideally, happens, as, a, careful, rational, and, orderly, process, but, it, often, takes, place, during, times, of, economic, and, political, crisis, the, fall, of, a, regime, and, the, resultant, power, struggles, even, when, it, happens, slowly, there, is, a, need, for, experimentation, testing, adjusting, and, replicating, successful, experiments, in, other, contexts, there, is, no, one, blueprint, for, decentralization, since, it, depends, on, the, initial, state, of, a, country, and, the, power, and, views, of, political, interests, and, whether, they, support, or, oppose, decentralization, decentralization, usually, is, a, conscious, process, based, on, explicit, policies, however, it, may, occur, as, silent, decentralization, in, the, absence, of, reforms, as, changes, in, networks, policy, emphasize, and, resource, availability, lead, inevitably, to, a, more, decentralized, system, decentralization, may, be, uneven, and, asymmetric, given, any, one, country, s, population, political, ethnic, and, other, forms, of, diversity, in, many, countries, political, economic, and, administrative, responsibilities, may, be, decentralized, to, the, larger, urban, areas, while, rural, areas, are, administered, by, the, central, government, decentralization, of, responsibilities, to, provinces, may, be, limited, only, to, those, provinces, or, states, which, want, or, are, capable, of, handling, responsibility, some, privatization, may, be, more, appropriate, to, an, urban, than, a, rural, area, some, types, of, privatization, may, be, more, appropriate, for, some, states, and, provinces, but, not, others, the, academic, literature, frequently, mentions, the, following, factors, as, determinants, of, decentralization, historians, have, described, the, history, of, governments, and, empires, in, terms, of, centralization, and, decentralization, in, his, 1910, the, history, of, nations, henry, cabot, lodge, wrote, that, persian, king, darius, i, 550, 486, bc, was, a, master, of, organization, and, for, the, first, time, in, history, centralization, becomes, a, political, fact, he, also, noted, that, this, contrasted, with, the, decentralization, of, ancient, greece, since, the, 1980s, a, number, of, scholars, have, written, about, cycles, of, centralization, and, decentralization, stephen, k, sanderson, wrote, that, over, the, last, 4000, years, chiefdoms, and, actual, states, have, gone, through, sequences, of, centralization, and, decentralization, of, economic, political, and, social, power, yildiz, atasoy, writes, this, process, has, been, going, on, since, the, stone, age, through, not, just, chiefdoms, and, states, but, empires, and, today, s, hegemonic, core, states, christopher, k, chase, dunn, and, thomas, d, hall, review, other, works, that, detail, these, cycles, including, works, which, analyze, the, concept, of, core, elites, which, compete, with, state, accumulation, of, wealth, and, how, their, intra, ruling, class, competition, accounts, for, the, rise, and, fall, of, states, and, their, phases, of, centralization, and, decentralization, rising, government, expenditures, poor, economic, performance, and, the, rise, of, free, market, influenced, ideas, have, convinced, governments, to, decentralize, their, operations, to, induce, competition, within, their, services, to, contract, out, to, private, firms, operating, in, the, market, and, to, privatize, some, functions, and, services, entirely, government, decentralization, has, both, political, and, administrative, aspects, its, decentralization, may, be, territorial, moving, power, from, a, central, city, to, other, localities, and, it, may, be, functional, moving, decision, making, from, the, top, administrator, of, any, branch, of, government, to, lower, level, officials, or, divesting, of, the, function, entirely, through, privatization, it, has, been, called, the, new, public, management, which, has, been, described, as, decentralization, management, by, objectives, contracting, out, competition, within, government, and, consumer, orientation, political, decentralization, signifies, a, reduction, in, the, authority, of, national, governments, over, policy, making, this, process, is, accomplished, by, the, institution, of, reforms, that, either, delegate, a, certain, degree, of, meaningful, decision, making, autonomy, to, sub, national, tiers, of, government, or, grant, citizens, the, right, to, elect, lower, level, officials, like, local, or, regional, representatives, depending, on, the, country, this, may, require, constitutional, or, statutory, reforms, the, development, of, new, political, parties, increased, power, for, legislatures, the, creation, of, local, political, units, and, encouragement, of, advocacy, groups, a, national, government, may, decide, to, decentralize, its, authority, and, responsibilities, for, a, variety, of, reasons, decentralization, reforms, may, occur, for, administrative, reasons, when, government, officials, decide, that, certain, responsibilities, and, decisions, would, be, handled, best, at, the, regional, or, local, level, in, democracies, traditionally, conservative, parties, include, political, decentralization, as, a, directive, in, their, platforms, because, rightist, parties, tend, to, advocate, for, a, decrease, in, the, role, of, central, government, there, is, also, strong, evidence, to, support, the, idea, that, government, stability, increases, the, probability, of, political, decentralization, since, instability, brought, on, by, gridlock, between, opposing, parties, in, legislatures, often, impedes, a, government, s, overall, ability, to, enact, sweeping, reforms, the, rise, of, regional, ethnic, parties, in, the, national, politics, of, parliamentary, democracies, is, also, heavily, associated, with, the, implementation, of, decentralization, reforms, ethnic, parties, may, endeavor, to, transfer, more, autonomy, to, their, respective, regions, and, as, a, partisan, strategy, ruling, parties, within, the, central, government, may, cooperate, by, establishing, regional, assemblies, in, order, to, curb, the, rise, of, ethnic, parties, in, national, elections, this, phenomenon, famously, occurred, in, 1999, when, the, united, kingdom, s, labour, party, appealed, to, scottish, constituents, by, creating, a, semi, autonomous, scottish, parliament, in, order, to, neutralize, the, threat, from, the, increasingly, popular, scottish, national, party, at, the, national, level, in, addition, to, increasing, the, administrative, efficacy, of, government, and, endowing, citizens, with, more, power, there, are, many, projected, advantages, to, political, decentralization, individuals, who, take, advantage, of, their, right, to, elect, local, and, regional, authorities, have, been, shown, to, have, more, positive, attitudes, toward, politics, and, increased, opportunities, for, civic, decision, making, through, participatory, democracy, mechanisms, like, public, consultations, and, participatory, budgeting, are, believed, to, help, legitimize, government, institutions, in, the, eyes, of, marginalized, groups, moreover, political, decentralization, is, perceived, as, a, valid, means, of, protecting, marginalized, communities, at, a, local, level, from, the, detrimental, aspects, of, development, and, globalization, driven, by, the, state, like, the, degradation, of, local, customs, codes, and, beliefs, in, his, 2013, book, democracy, and, political, ignorance, george, mason, university, law, professor, ilya, somin, argued, that, political, decentralization, in, a, federal, democracy, confronts, the, widespread, issue, of, political, ignorance, by, allowing, citizens, to, engage, in, foot, voting, or, moving, to, other, jurisdictions, with, more, favorable, laws, he, cites, the, mass, migration, of, over, one, million, southern, born, african, americans, to, the, north, or, the, west, to, evade, discriminatory, jim, crow, laws, in, the, late, 19th, century, and, early, 20th, century, the, european, union, follows, the, principle, of, subsidiarity, which, holds, that, decision, making, should, be, made, by, the, most, local, competent, authority, the, eu, should, decide, only, on, enumerated, issues, that, a, local, or, member, state, authority, cannot, address, themselves, furthermore, enforcement, is, exclusively, the, domain, of, member, states, in, finland, the, centre, party, explicitly, supports, decentralization, for, example, government, departments, have, been, moved, from, the, capital, helsinki, to, the, provinces, the, centre, supports, substantial, subsidies, that, limit, potential, economic, and, political, centralization, to, helsinki, political, decentralization, does, not, come, without, its, drawbacks, a, study, by, fan, concludes, that, there, is, an, increase, in, corruption, and, rent, seeking, when, there, are, more, vertical, tiers, in, the, government, as, well, as, when, there, are, higher, levels, of, subnational, government, employment, other, studies, warn, of, high, level, politicians, that, may, intentionally, deprive, regional, and, local, authorities, of, power, and, resources, when, conflicts, arise, in, order, to, combat, these, negative, forces, experts, believe, that, political, decentralization, should, be, supplemented, with, other, conflict, management, mechanisms, like, power, sharing, particularly, in, regions, with, ethnic, tensions, four, major, forms, of, administrative, decentralization, have, been, described, fiscal, decentralization, means, decentralizing, revenue, raising, and, or, expenditure, of, moneys, to, a, lower, level, of, government, while, maintaining, financial, responsibility, while, this, process, usually, is, called, fiscal, federalism, it, may, be, relevant, to, unitary, federal, or, confederal, governments, fiscal, federalism, also, concerns, the, vertical, imbalances, where, the, central, government, gives, too, much, or, too, little, money, to, the, lower, levels, it, actually, can, be, a, way, of, increasing, central, government, control, of, lower, levels, of, government, if, it, is, not, linked, to, other, kinds, of, responsibilities, and, authority, fiscal, decentralization, can, be, achieved, through, user, fees, user, participation, through, monetary, or, labor, contributions, expansion, of, local, property, or, sales, taxes, intergovernmental, transfers, of, central, government, tax, monies, to, local, governments, through, transfer, payments, or, grants, and, authorization, of, municipal, borrowing, with, national, government, loan, guarantees, transfers, of, money, may, be, given, conditionally, with, instructions, or, unconditionally, without, them, market, decentralization, can, be, done, through, privatization, of, public, owned, functions, and, businesses, as, described, briefly, above, but, it, also, is, done, through, deregulation, the, abolition, of, restrictions, on, businesses, competing, with, government, services, for, example, postal, services, schools, garbage, collection, even, as, private, companies, and, corporations, have, worked, to, have, such, services, contracted, out, to, or, privatized, by, them, others, have, worked, to, have, these, turned, over, to, non, profit, organizations, or, associations, from, the, 1970s, to, the, 1990s, there, was, deregulation, of, some, industries, like, banking, trucking, airlines, and, telecommunications, which, resulted, generally, in, more, competition, and, lower, prices, according, to, the, cato, institute, an, american, libertarian, think, tank, in, some, cases, deregulation, in, some, aspects, of, an, industry, were, offset, by, increased, regulation, in, other, aspects, the, electricity, industry, being, a, prime, example, for, example, in, banking, cato, institute, believes, some, deregulation, allowed, banks, to, compete, across, state, lines, increasing, consumer, choice, while, an, actual, increase, in, regulators, and, regulations, forced, banks, to, make, loans, to, individuals, incapable, of, repaying, them, leading, eventually, to, the, financial, crisis, of, 2007, 2008, one, example, of, economic, decentralization, which, is, based, on, a, libertarian, socialist, model, is, decentralized, economic, planning, decentralized, planning, is, a, type, of, economic, system, in, which, decision, making, is, distributed, amongst, various, economic, agents, or, localized, within, production, agents, an, example, of, this, method, in, practice, is, in, kerala, india, which, experimented, in, 1996, with, the, people, s, plan, campaign, emmanuelle, auriol, and, michel, benaim, write, about, the, comparative, benefits, of, decentralization, versus, government, regulation, in, the, setting, of, standards, they, find, that, while, there, may, be, a, need, for, public, regulation, if, public, safety, is, at, stake, private, creation, of, standards, usually, is, better, because, regulators, or, experts, might, misrepresent, consumers, tastes, and, needs, as, long, as, companies, are, averse, to, incompatible, standards, standards, will, be, created, that, satisfy, needs, of, a, modern, economy, central, governments, themselves, may, own, large, tracts, of, land, and, control, the, forest, water, mineral, wildlife, and, other, resources, they, contain, they, may, manage, them, through, government, operations, or, leasing, them, to, private, businesses, or, they, may, neglect, them, to, be, exploited, by, individuals, or, groups, who, defy, non, enforced, laws, against, exploitation, it, also, may, control, most, private, land, through, land, use, zoning, environmental, and, other, regulations, selling, off, or, leasing, lands, can, be, profitable, for, governments, willing, to, relinquish, control, but, such, programs, can, face, public, scrutiny, because, of, fear, of, a, loss, of, heritage, or, of, environmental, damage, devolution, of, control, to, regional, or, local, governments, has, been, found, to, be, an, effective, way, of, dealing, with, these, concerns, such, decentralization, has, happened, in, india, and, other, developing, nations, libertarian, socialism, is, a, political, philosophy, that, promotes, a, non, hierarchical, non, bureaucratic, society, without, private, ownership, in, the, means, of, production, libertarian, socialists, believe, in, converting, present, day, private, productive, property, into, common, or, public, goods, it, promotes, free, association, in, place, of, government, non, coercive, forms, fo, social, organization, and, opposes, the, various, social, relations, of, capitalism, such, as, wage, slavery, the, term, libertarian, socialism, is, used, by, some, socialists, to, differentiate, their, philosophy, from, state, socialism, and, by, some, as, a, synonym, for, left, anarchism, accordingly, libertarian, socialists, believe, that, the, exercise, of, power, in, any, institutionalized, form, whether, economic, political, religious, or, sexual, brutalizes, both, the, wielder, of, power, and, the, one, over, whom, it, is, exercised, libertarian, socialists, generally, place, their, hopes, in, decentralized, means, of, direct, democracy, such, as, libertarian, municipalism, citizens, assemblies, or, workers, councils, libertarian, socialists, are, strongly, critical, of, coercive, institutions, which, often, leads, them, to, reject, the, legitimacy, of, the, state, in, favor, of, anarchism, adherents, propose, achieving, this, through, decentralization, of, political, and, economic, power, usually, involving, the, socialization, of, most, large, scale, private, property, and, enterprise, while, retaining, respect, for, personal, property, libertarian, socialism, tends, to, deny, the, legitimacy, of, most, forms, of, economically, significant, private, property, viewing, capitalist, property, relations, as, forms, of, domination, that, are, antagonistic, to, individual, freedom, free, market, ideas, popular, in, the, 19th, century, such, as, those, of, adam, smith, returned, to, prominence, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, austrian, school, economist, friedrich, von, hayek, argued, that, free, markets, themselves, are, decentralized, systems, where, outcomes, are, produced, without, explicit, agreement, or, coordination, by, individuals, who, use, prices, as, their, guide, eleanor, doyle, writes, that, conomic, decision, making, in, free, markets, is, decentralized, across, all, the, individuals, dispersed, in, each, market, and, is, synchronized, or, coordinated, by, the, price, system, and, holds, that, an, individual, right, to, property, is, part, of, this, decentralized, system, criticizing, central, government, control, hayek, wrote, in, the, road, to, serfdom, there, would, be, no, difficulty, about, efficient, control, or, planning, were, conditions, so, simple, that, a, single, person, or, board, could, effectively, survey, all, the, relevant, facts, it, is, only, as, the, factors, which, have, to, be, taken, into, account, become, so, numerous, that, it, is, impossible, to, gain, a, synoptic, view, of, them, that, decentralization, becomes, imperative, according, to, bruce, m, owen, this, does, not, mean, that, all, firms, themselves, have, to, be, equally, decentralized, he, writes, markets, allocate, resources, through, arms, length, transactions, among, decentralized, actors, much, of, the, time, markets, work, very, efficiently, but, there, is, a, variety, of, conditions, under, which, firms, do, better, hence, goods, and, services, are, produced, and, sold, by, firms, with, various, degrees, of, horizontal, and, vertical, integration, additionally, he, writes, that, the, economic, incentive, to, expand, horizontally, or, vertically, is, usually, but, not, always, compatible, with, the, social, interest, in, maximizing, long, run, consumer, welfare, it, is, often, claimed, that, free, markets, and, private, property, generate, centralized, monopolies, and, other, ills, free, market, advocates, counter, with, the, argument, that, government, is, the, source, of, monopoly, historian, gabriel, kolko, in, his, book, the, triumph, of, conservatism, argued, that, in, the, first, decade, of, the, 20th, century, businesses, were, highly, decentralized, and, competitive, with, new, businesses, constantly, entering, existing, industries, in, his, view, there, was, no, trend, towards, concentration, and, monopolization, while, there, were, a, wave, of, mergers, of, companies, trying, to, corner, markets, they, found, there, was, too, much, competition, to, do, so, according, to, kolko, this, was, also, true, in, banking, and, finance, which, saw, decentralization, as, leading, to, instability, as, state, and, local, banks, competed, with, the, big, new, york, city, firms, he, argues, that, as, a, result, the, largest, firms, turned, to, the, power, of, the, state, and, worked, with, leaders, like, united, states, presidents, theodore, roosevelt, william, h, taft, and, woodrow, wilson, to, pass, as, progressive, reforms, centralizing, laws, like, the, federal, reserve, act, of, 1913, that, gave, control, of, the, monetary, system, to, the, wealthiest, bankers, the, formation, of, monopoly, public, utilities, that, made, competition, with, those, monopolies, illegal, federal, inspection, of, meat, packers, biased, against, small, companies, extending, interstate, commerce, commission, to, regulating, telephone, companies, and, keeping, rates, high, to, benefit, at, t, and, using, the, sherman, antitrust, act, against, companies, which, might, combine, to, threaten, larger, or, monopoly, companies, author, and, activist, jane, jacobs, s, influential, 1961, book, the, death, and, life, of, american, cities, criticized, large, scale, redevelopment, projects, which, were, part, of, government, planned, decentralization, of, population, and, businesses, to, suburbs, she, believed, it, destroyed, cities, economies, and, impoverished, remaining, residents, her, 1980, book, the, question, of, separatism, quebec, and, the, struggle, over, sovereignty, supported, secession, of, quebec, from, canada, her, 1984, book, cities, and, the, wealth, of, nations, proposed, a, solution, to, the, problems, faced, by, cities, whose, economies, were, being, ruined, by, centralized, national, governments, decentralization, through, the, multiplication, of, sovereignties, meaning, an, acceptance, of, the, right, of, cities, to, secede, from, the, larger, nation, states, that, were, greatly, limiting, their, ability, to, produce, wealth, in, response, to, incentive, and, information, conflicts, a, firm, can, either, centralize, their, organizational, structure, by, concentrating, decision, making, to, upper, management, or, decentralize, their, organizational, structure, by, delegating, authority, throughout, the, organization, the, delegation, of, authority, comes, with, a, basic, trade, off, while, it, can, increase, efficiency, and, information, flow, the, central, authority, consequentially, suffers, a, loss, of, control, however, through, creating, an, environment, of, trust, and, allocating, authority, formally, in, the, firm, coupled, with, a, stronger, rule, of, law, in, the, geographical, location, of, the, firm, the, negative, consequences, of, the, trade, off, can, be, minimized, in, having, a, decentralized, organizational, structure, a, firm, can, remain, agile, to, external, shocks, and, competing, trends, decision, making, in, a, centralized, organization, can, face, information, flow, inefficiencies, and, barriers, to, effective, communication, which, decreases, the, speed, and, accuracy, in, which, decisions, are, made, a, decentralized, firm, is, said, to, hold, greater, flexibility, given, the, efficiency, in, which, it, can, analyze, information, and, implement, relevant, outcomes, additionally, having, decision, making, power, spread, across, different, areas, allows, for, local, knowledge, to, inform, decisions, increasing, their, relevancy, and, implementational, effectiveness, in, the, process, of, developing, new, products, or, services, the, decentralization, enable, the, firm, gain, advantages, of, closely, meet, particular, division, s, needs, decentralization, also, impacts, human, resource, management, the, high, level, of, individual, agency, that, workers, experience, within, a, decentralized, firm, can, create, job, enrichment, studies, have, shown, this, enhances, the, development, of, new, ideas, and, innovations, given, the, sense, of, involvement, that, comes, from, responsibility, the, impacts, of, decentralization, on, innovation, are, furthered, by, the, ease, of, information, flow, that, comes, from, this, organizational, structure, with, increased, knowledge, sharing, workers, are, more, able, to, use, relevant, information, to, inform, decision, making, these, benefits, are, enhanced, in, firms, with, skill, intensive, environments, skilled, workers, are, more, able, to, analyze, information, they, pose, less, risk, of, information, duplication, given, increased, communication, abilities, and, the, productivity, cost, of, multi, tasking, is, lower, these, outcomes, of, decentralizion, make, it, a, particularly, effective, organizational, structure, for, entrepreneurial, and, competitive, firm, environments, such, as, start, up, companies, the, flexibility, efficiency, of, information, flow, and, higher, worker, autonomy, complement, the, rapid, growth, and, innovation, seen, in, successful, start, up, companies, technological, decentralization, can, be, defined, as, a, shift, from, concentrated, to, distributed, modes, of, production, and, consumption, of, goods, and, services, generally, such, shifts, are, accompanied, by, transformations, in, technology, and, different, technologies, are, applied, for, either, system, technology, includes, tools, materials, skills, techniques, and, processes, by, which, goals, are, accomplished, in, the, public, and, private, spheres, concepts, of, decentralization, of, technology, are, used, throughout, all, types, of, technology, including, especially, information, technology, and, appropriate, technology, technologies, often, mentioned, as, best, implemented, in, a, decentralized, manner, include, water, purification, delivery, and, waste, water, disposal, agricultural, technology, and, energy, technology, advances, in, technology, may, create, opportunities, for, decentralized, and, privatized, replacements, for, what, had, traditionally, been, public, services, or, utilities, such, as, power, water, mail, telecommunications, consumer, product, safety, banking, medical, licensure, parking, meters, and, auto, emissions, however, in, terms, of, technology, a, clear, distinction, between, fully, centralized, or, decentralized, technical, solutions, is, often, not, possible, and, therefore, finding, an, optimal, degree, of, centralization, difficult, from, an, infrastructure, planning, perspective, information, technology, encompasses, computers, and, computer, networks, as, well, as, information, distribution, technologies, such, as, television, and, telephones, the, whole, computer, industry, of, computer, hardware, software, electronics, internet, telecommunications, equipment, e, commerce, and, computer, services, are, included, executives, and, managers, face, a, constant, tension, between, centralizing, and, decentralizing, information, technology, for, their, organizations, they, must, find, the, right, balance, of, centralizing, which, lowers, costs, and, allows, more, control, by, upper, management, and, decentralizing, which, allows, sub, units, and, users, more, control, this, will, depend, on, analysis, of, the, specific, situation, decentralization, is, particularly, applicable, to, business, or, management, units, which, have, a, high, level, of, independence, complicated, products, and, customers, and, technology, less, relevant, to, other, units, information, technology, applied, to, government, communications, with, citizens, often, called, e, government, is, supposed, to, support, decentralization, and, democratization, various, forms, have, been, instituted, in, most, nations, worldwide, the, internet, is, an, example, of, an, extremely, decentralized, network, having, no, owners, at, all, although, some, have, argued, that, this, is, less, the, case, in, recent, years, no, one, is, in, charge, of, internet, and, everyone, is, as, long, as, they, follow, a, certain, minimal, number, of, rules, anyone, can, be, a, service, provider, or, a, user, voluntary, boards, establish, protocols, but, cannot, stop, anyone, from, developing, new, ones, other, examples, of, open, source, or, decentralized, movements, are, wikis, which, allow, users, to, add, modify, or, delete, content, via, the, internet, wikipedia, has, been, described, as, decentralized, although, it, is, a, centralized, web, site, with, a, single, entity, operating, the, servers, smartphones, have, been, described, as, being, an, important, part, of, the, decentralizing, effects, of, smaller, and, cheaper, computers, worldwide, decentralization, continues, throughout, the, industry, for, example, as, the, decentralized, architecture, of, wireless, routers, installed, in, homes, and, offices, supplement, and, even, replace, phone, companies, relatively, centralized, long, range, cell, towers, inspired, by, system, and, cybernetics, theorists, like, norbert, wiener, marshall, mcluhan, and, buckminster, fuller, in, the, 1960s, stewart, brand, started, the, whole, earth, catalog, and, later, computer, networking, efforts, to, bring, silicon, valley, computer, technologists, and, entrepreneurs, together, with, countercultural, ideas, this, resulted, in, ideas, like, personal, computing, virtual, communities, and, the, vision, of, an, electronic, frontier, which, would, be, a, more, decentralized, egalitarian, and, free, market, libertarian, society, related, ideas, coming, out, of, silicon, valley, included, the, free, software, and, creative, commons, movements, which, produced, visions, of, a, networked, information, economy, because, human, interactions, in, cyberspace, transcend, physical, geography, there, is, a, necessity, for, new, theories, in, legal, and, other, rule, making, systems, to, deal, with, decentralized, decision, making, processes, in, such, systems, for, example, what, rules, should, apply, to, conduct, on, the, global, digital, network, and, who, should, set, them, the, laws, of, which, nations, govern, issues, of, internet, transactions, like, seller, disclosure, requirements, or, definitions, of, fraud, copyright, and, trademark, decentralized, computing, is, the, allocation, of, resources, both, hardware, and, software, to, each, individual, workstation, or, office, location, in, contrast, centralized, computing, exists, when, the, majority, of, functions, are, carried, out, or, obtained, from, a, remote, centralized, location, decentralized, computing, is, a, trend, in, modern, day, business, environments, this, is, the, opposite, of, centralized, computing, which, was, prevalent, during, the, early, days, of, computers, a, decentralized, computer, system, has, many, benefits, over, a, conventional, centralized, network, desktop, computers, have, advanced, so, rapidly, that, their, potential, performance, far, exceeds, the, requirements, of, most, business, applications, this, results, in, most, desktop, computers, remaining, idle, in, relation, to, their, full, potential, a, decentralized, system, can, use, the, potential, of, these, systems, to, maximize, efficiency, however, it, is, debatable, whether, these, networks, increase, overall, effectiveness, all, computers, have, to, be, updated, individually, with, new, software, unlike, a, centralized, computer, system, decentralized, systems, still, enable, file, sharing, and, all, computers, can, share, peripherals, such, as, printers, and, scanners, as, well, as, modems, allowing, all, the, computers, in, the, network, to, connect, to, the, internet, the, new, yorker, reports, that, although, the, internet, was, originally, decentralized, by, 2013, it, had, become, less, so, a, staggering, percentage, of, communications, flow, through, a, small, set, of, corporations, and, thus, under, the, profound, influence, of, those, companies, and, other, institutions, one, solution, espoused, by, some, programmers, is, to, make, the, internet, more, like, it, used, to, be, less, centralized, and, more, distributed, examples, of, projects, that, attempt, to, contribute, to, the, re, decentralization, of, the, internet, include, arkos, diaspora, freedombox, indieweb, namecoin, safe, network, twtxt, and, zeronet, as, well, as, advocacy, group, redecentralize, org, which, provides, support, for, projects, that, aim, to, make, the, web, less, centralized, in, an, interview, with, bbc, radio, 5, live, one, of, the, co, founders, of, redecentralize, org, explained, that, as, we, ve, gone, on, there, s, been, more, and, more, internet, traffic, focused, through, particular, nodes, such, as, google, or, facebook, centralised, services, that, hold, all, the, user, data, and, host, it, themselves, have, become, increasingly, popular, because, that, business, model, has, worked, as, the, internet, has, become, more, mass, market, people, are, not, necessarily, willing, or, knowledgable, to, host, it, themselves, so, where, that, hosting, is, outsourced, it, s, become, the, default, which, allows, a, centralization, of, power, and, a, centralization, of, data, that, i, think, is, worrying, in, blockchain, decentralization, refers, to, the, transfer, of, control, and, decision, making, from, a, centralized, entity, individual, organization, or, group, thereof, to, a, distributed, network, decentralized, networks, strive, to, reduce, the, level, of, trust, that, participants, must, place, in, one, another, and, deter, their, ability, to, exert, authority, or, control, over, one, another, in, ways, that, degrade, the, functionality, of, the, network, decentralized, protocols, applications, and, ledgers, used, in, web3, could, be, more, difficult, for, governments, to, regulate, similar, to, difficulties, regulating, bittorrent, which, is, not, a, blockchain, technology, factors, hindering, decentralization, include, weak, local, administrative, or, technical, capacity, which, may, result, in, inefficient, or, ineffective, services, inadequate, financial, resources, available, to, perform, new, local, responsibilities, especially, in, the, start, up, phase, when, they, are, most, needed, or, inequitable, distribution, of, resources, decentralization, can, make, national, policy, coordination, too, complex, it, may, allow, local, elites, to, capture, functions, local, cooperation, may, be, undermined, by, any, distrust, between, private, and, public, sectors, decentralization, may, result, in, higher, enforcement, costs, and, conflict, for, resources, if, there, is, no, higher, level, of, authority, additionally, decentralization, may, not, be, as, efficient, for, standardized, routine, network, based, services, as, opposed, to, those, that, need, more, complicated, inputs, if, there, is, a, loss, of, economies, of, scale, in, procurement, of, labor, or, resources, the, expense, of, decentralization, can, rise, even, as, central, governments, lose, control, over, financial, resources, it, has, been, noted, that, while, decentralization, may, increase, productive, efficiency, it, may, undermine, allocative, efficiency, by, making, redistribution, of, wealth, more, difficult, decentralization, will, cause, greater, disparities, between, rich, and, poor, regions, especially, during, times, of, crisis, when, the, national, government, may, not, be, able, to, help, regions, needing, it
