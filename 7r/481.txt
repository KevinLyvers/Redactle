universal, second, language, for, international, communication, or, the, international, language, la, lingvo, internacia, zamenhof, first, described, the, language, in, dr, esperanto, s, international, language, esperanto, unua, libro, which, he, published, under, the, pseudonym, doktoro, esperanto, early, adopters, of, the, language, liked, the, name, esperanto, and, soon, used, it, to, describe, his, language, the, word, esperanto, translates, into, english, as, one, who, hopes, within, the, range, of, constructed, languages, esperanto, occupies, a, middle, ground, between, naturalistic, imitating, existing, natural, languages, and, a, priori, where, features, are, not, based, on, existing, languages, esperanto, s, vocabulary, syntax, and, semantics, derive, predominantly, from, languages, of, the, indo, european, group, a, substantial, majority, of, its, vocabulary, approximately, 80, derives, from, romance, languages, but, it, also, contains, elements, derived, from, germanic, greek, and, slavic, languages, one, of, the, language, s, most, notable, features, is, its, extensive, system, of, derivation, where, prefixes, and, suffixes, may, be, freely, combined, with, roots, to, generate, words, making, it, possible, to, communicate, effectively, with, a, smaller, set, of, words, esperanto, is, the, most, successful, constructed, international, auxiliary, language, and, the, only, such, language, with, a, sizeable, population, of, native, speakers, of, which, there, are, perhaps, several, thousand, usage, estimates, are, difficult, but, two, estimates, put, the, number, of, people, who, know, how, to, speak, esperanto, at, around, 100, 000, concentration, of, speakers, is, highest, in, europe, east, asia, and, south, america, although, no, country, has, adopted, esperanto, officially, esperantujo, esperanto, land, is, used, as, a, name, for, the, collection, of, places, where, it, is, spoken, the, language, has, also, gained, a, noticeable, presence, on, the, internet, in, recent, years, as, it, became, increasingly, accessible, on, platforms, such, as, duolingo, wikipedia, amikumu, and, google, translate, esperanto, speakers, are, often, called, esperantists, esperantistoj, esperanto, was, created, in, the, late, 1870s, and, early, 1880s, by, l, l, zamenhof, a, jewish, ophthalmologist, from, bia, ystok, then, part, of, the, russian, empire, but, now, part, of, poland, according, to, zamenhof, he, created, the, language, to, reduce, the, time, and, labor, we, spend, in, learning, foreign, tongues, and, to, foster, harmony, between, people, from, different, countries, were, there, but, an, international, language, all, translations, would, be, made, into, it, alone, and, all, nations, would, be, united, in, a, common, brotherhood, his, feelings, and, the, situation, in, bia, ystok, may, be, gleaned, from, an, extract, from, his, letter, to, nikolai, borovko, the, place, where, i, was, born, and, spent, my, childhood, gave, direction, to, all, my, future, struggles, in, bia, ystok, the, inhabitants, were, divided, into, four, distinct, elements, russians, poles, germans, and, jews, each, of, these, spoke, their, own, language, and, looked, on, all, the, others, as, enemies, in, such, a, town, a, sensitive, nature, feels, more, acutely, than, elsewhere, the, misery, caused, by, language, division, and, sees, at, every, step, that, the, diversity, of, languages, is, the, first, or, at, least, the, most, influential, basis, for, the, separation, of, the, human, family, into, groups, of, enemies, i, was, brought, up, as, an, idealist, i, was, taught, that, all, people, were, brothers, while, outside, in, the, street, at, every, step, i, felt, that, there, were, no, people, only, russians, poles, germans, jews, and, so, on, this, was, always, a, great, torment, to, my, infant, mind, although, many, people, may, smile, at, such, an, anguish, for, the, world, in, a, child, since, at, that, time, i, thought, that, grown, ups, were, omnipotent, i, often, said, to, myself, that, when, i, grew, up, i, would, certainly, destroy, this, evil, it, was, invented, in, 1887, and, designed, so, that, anyone, could, learn, it, in, a, few, short, months, dr, zamenhof, lived, on, dzika, street, no, 9, which, was, just, around, the, corner, from, the, street, on, which, we, lived, brother, afrum, was, so, impressed, with, that, idea, that, he, learned, esperanto, in, a, very, short, time, at, home, from, a, little, book, he, then, bought, many, dozens, of, them, and, gave, them, out, to, relatives, friends, just, anyone, he, could, to, support, that, magnificent, idea, for, he, felt, that, this, would, be, a, common, bond, to, promote, relationships, with, fellow, men, in, the, world, a, group, of, people, had, organized, and, sent, letters, to, the, government, asking, to, change, the, name, of, the, street, where, dr, zamenhof, lived, for, many, years, when, he, invented, esperanto, from, dzika, to, zamenhofa, they, were, told, that, a, petition, with, a, large, number, of, signatures, would, be, needed, that, took, time, so, they, organized, demonstrations, carrying, large, posters, encouraging, people, to, learn, the, universal, language, and, to, sign, the, petitions, about, the, same, time, in, the, middle, of, the, block, marched, a, huge, demonstration, of, people, holding, posters, reading, learn, esperanto, support, the, universal, language, esperanto, the, language, of, hope, and, expectation, esperanto, the, bond, for, international, communication, and, so, on, and, many, sign, the, petitions, i, will, never, forget, that, rich, poor, sad, glad, parade, and, among, all, these, people, stood, two, fiery, red, tramway, cars, waiting, on, their, opposite, lanes, and, also, a, few, doro, kas, with, their, horses, squeezed, in, between, such, a, sight, it, was, later, a, few, blocks, were, changed, from, dzika, street, to, dr, zamenhofa, street, and, a, nice, monument, was, erected, there, with, his, name, and, his, invention, inscribed, on, it, to, honor, his, memory, zamenhof, s, goal, was, to, create, an, easy, and, flexible, language, that, would, serve, as, a, universal, second, language, to, foster, world, peace, and, international, understanding, and, to, build, a, community, of, speakers, his, original, title, for, the, language, was, simply, the, international, language, la, lingvo, internacia, but, early, speakers, grew, fond, of, the, name, esperanto, and, began, to, use, it, as, the, name, for, the, language, just, two, years, after, its, creation, the, name, quickly, gained, prominence, and, has, been, used, as, an, official, name, ever, since, in, 1905, zamenhof, published, the, fundamento, de, esperanto, as, a, definitive, guide, to, the, language, later, that, year, french, esperantists, organized, with, his, participation, the, first, world, esperanto, congress, an, ongoing, annual, conference, in, boulogne, sur, mer, france, zamenhof, also, proposed, to, the, first, congress, that, an, independent, body, of, linguistic, scholars, should, steward, the, future, evolution, of, esperanto, foreshadowing, the, founding, of, the, akademio, de, esperanto, in, part, modeled, after, the, acad, mie, fran, aise, which, was, established, soon, thereafter, since, then, world, congresses, have, been, held, in, different, countries, every, year, except, during, the, two, world, wars, and, the, 2020, covid, 19, pandemic, when, it, was, moved, to, an, online, only, event, since, the, second, world, war, they, have, been, attended, by, an, average, of, more, than, 2, 000, people, and, up, to, 6, 000, people, at, the, most, zamenhof, wrote, that, he, wanted, mankind, to, learn, and, use, en, masse, the, proposed, language, as, a, living, one, the, goal, for, esperanto, to, become, a, global, auxiliary, language, was, not, zamenhof, s, only, goal, he, also, wanted, to, enable, the, learner, to, make, direct, use, of, his, knowledge, with, persons, of, any, nationality, whether, the, language, be, universally, accepted, or, not, in, other, words, the, language, is, to, be, directly, a, means, of, international, communication, after, some, ten, years, of, development, which, zamenhof, spent, translating, literature, into, esperanto, as, well, as, writing, original, prose, and, verse, the, first, book, of, esperanto, grammar, was, published, in, warsaw, on, july, 26, 1887, the, number, of, speakers, grew, rapidly, over, the, next, few, decades, at, first, primarily, in, the, russian, empire, and, central, europe, then, in, other, parts, of, europe, the, americas, china, and, japan, in, the, early, years, before, the, world, congresses, speakers, of, esperanto, kept, in, contact, primarily, through, correspondence, and, periodicals, zamenhof, s, name, for, the, language, was, simply, internacia, lingvo, international, language, december, 15, zamenhof, s, birthday, is, now, regarded, as, zamenhof, day, or, esperanto, book, day, the, autonomous, territory, of, neutral, moresnet, between, what, is, today, belgium, and, germany, had, a, sizable, proportion, of, esperanto, speaking, citizens, among, its, small, diverse, population, there, was, a, proposal, to, make, esperanto, its, official, language, however, neither, belgium, nor, germany, had, surrendered, their, claims, to, the, region, with, the, latter, having, adopted, a, more, aggressive, stance, towards, pursuing, its, claim, around, the, turn, of, the, century, even, being, accused, of, sabotage, and, administrative, obstruction, to, force, the, issue, the, outbreak, of, world, war, i, would, bring, about, the, end, of, neutrality, with, moresnet, initially, left, as, an, oasis, in, a, desert, of, destruction, following, the, german, invasion, of, belgium, the, territory, was, formally, annexed, by, prussia, in, 1915, though, without, international, recognition, after, the, war, a, great, opportunity, for, esperanto, seemingly, presented, itself, when, the, iranian, delegation, to, the, league, of, nations, proposed, that, the, language, be, adopted, for, use, in, international, relations, following, a, report, by, a, japanese, delegate, to, the, league, named, nitobe, inaz, in, the, context, of, the, 13th, world, congress, of, esperanto, held, in, prague, ten, delegates, accepted, the, proposal, with, only, one, voice, against, the, french, delegate, gabriel, hanotaux, hanotaux, opposed, all, recognition, of, esperanto, at, the, league, from, the, first, resolution, on, december, 18, 1920, and, subsequently, through, all, efforts, during, the, next, three, years, hanotaux, did, not, approve, of, how, the, french, language, was, losing, its, position, as, the, international, language, and, saw, esperanto, as, a, threat, effectively, wielding, his, veto, power, to, block, the, decision, however, two, years, later, the, league, recommended, that, its, member, states, include, esperanto, in, their, educational, curricula, the, french, government, retaliated, by, banning, all, instruction, in, esperanto, in, france, s, schools, and, universities, the, french, ministry, of, public, instruction, said, that, french, and, english, would, perish, and, the, literary, standard, of, the, world, would, be, debased, nonetheless, many, people, see, the, 1920s, as, the, heyday, of, the, esperanto, movement, during, this, time, anarchism, as, a, political, movement, was, very, supportive, of, both, anationalism, and, the, esperanto, language, fran, novljan, was, one, of, the, chief, promoters, of, esperanto, in, the, former, kingdom, of, yugoslavia, he, was, among, the, founders, of, the, croatian, prosvjetni, savez, educational, alliance, of, which, he, was, the, first, secretary, and, organized, esperanto, institutions, in, zagreb, novljan, collaborated, with, esperanto, newspapers, and, magazines, and, was, the, author, of, the, esperanto, textbook, internacia, lingvo, esperanto, i, esperanto, en, tridek, lecionoj, in, 1920s, korea, socialist, thinkers, pushed, for, the, use, of, esperanto, through, a, series, of, columns, in, the, dong, a, ilbo, as, resistance, to, both, japanese, occupation, as, well, as, a, counter, to, the, growing, nationalist, movement, for, korean, language, standardization, this, lasted, until, the, mukden, incident, in, 1931, when, changing, colonial, policy, led, to, an, outright, ban, on, esperanto, education, in, korea, esperanto, attracted, the, suspicion, of, many, states, repression, was, especially, pronounced, in, nazi, germany, francoist, spain, up, until, the, 1950s, and, the, soviet, union, under, stalin, from, 1937, to, 1956, in, nazi, germany, there, was, a, motivation, to, ban, esperanto, because, zamenhof, was, jewish, and, due, to, the, internationalist, nature, of, esperanto, which, was, perceived, as, bolshevist, in, his, work, mein, kampf, adolf, hitler, specifically, mentioned, esperanto, as, an, example, of, a, language, that, could, be, used, by, an, international, jewish, conspiracy, once, they, achieved, world, domination, esperantists, were, killed, during, the, holocaust, with, zamenhof, s, family, in, particular, singled, out, to, be, killed, the, efforts, of, a, minority, of, german, esperantists, to, expel, their, jewish, colleagues, and, overtly, align, themselves, with, the, reich, were, futile, and, esperanto, was, legally, forbidden, in, 1935, esperantists, in, german, concentration, camps, did, however, teach, esperanto, to, fellow, prisoners, telling, guards, they, were, teaching, italian, the, language, of, one, of, germany, s, axis, allies, in, imperial, japan, the, left, wing, of, the, japanese, esperanto, movement, was, forbidden, but, its, leaders, were, careful, enough, not, to, give, the, impression, to, the, government, that, the, esperantists, were, socialist, revolutionaries, which, proved, a, successful, strategy, after, the, october, revolution, of, 1917, esperanto, was, given, a, measure, of, government, support, by, the, new, communist, states, in, the, former, russian, empire, and, later, by, the, soviet, union, government, with, the, soviet, esperantist, union, being, established, as, an, organization, that, temporarily, was, officially, recognized, in, his, biography, on, joseph, stalin, leon, trotsky, mentions, that, stalin, had, studied, esperanto, however, in, 1937, at, the, height, of, the, great, purge, stalin, completely, reversed, the, soviet, government, s, policies, on, esperanto, many, esperanto, speakers, were, executed, exiled, or, held, in, captivity, in, the, gulag, labour, camps, quite, often, the, accusation, was, you, are, an, active, member, of, an, international, spy, organization, which, hides, itself, under, the, name, of, association, of, soviet, esperantists, on, the, territory, of, the, soviet, union, until, the, end, of, the, stalin, era, it, was, dangerous, to, use, esperanto, in, the, soviet, union, even, though, it, was, never, officially, forbidden, to, speak, esperanto, fascist, italy, allowed, the, use, of, esperanto, finding, its, phonology, similar, to, that, of, italian, and, publishing, some, tourist, material, in, the, language, during, and, after, the, spanish, civil, war, francoist, spain, suppressed, anarchists, socialists, and, catalan, nationalists, for, many, years, among, whom, the, use, of, esperanto, was, extensive, but, in, the, 1950s, the, esperanto, movement, was, again, tolerated, in, 1954, the, united, nations, through, unesco, granted, official, support, to, esperanto, as, an, international, auxiliary, language, in, the, montevideo,

in, stranga, strange, and, five, in, medial, position, as, in, ekssklavo, former, slave, final, clusters, are, uncommon, except, in, unassimilated, names, poetic, elision, of, final, o, and, a, very, few, basic, words, such, as, cent, hundred, and, post, after, esperanto, has, the, five, vowels, found, in, such, languages, as, spanish, modern, hebrew, and, modern, greek, since, there, are, only, five, vowels, a, good, deal, of, variation, in, pronunciation, is, tolerated, for, instance, e, commonly, ranges, from, french, to, french, these, details, often, depend, on, the, speaker, s, native, language, a, glottal, stop, may, occur, between, adjacent, vowels, in, some, people, s, speech, especially, when, the, two, vowels, are, the, same, as, in, heroo, hero, or, and, praavo, great, grandfather, or, the, esperanto, alphabet, is, based, on, the, latin, script, using, a, one, sound, one, letter, principle, with, the, exception, of, it, includes, six, letters, with, diacritics, five, with, circumflexes, and, and, one, with, a, breve, the, alphabet, does, not, include, the, letters, q, w, x, or, y, which, are, only, used, in, the, writing, of, proper, names, and, unassimilated, borrowings, the, 28, letter, alphabet, is, all, letters, lacking, diacritics, are, pronounced, approximately, as, their, respective, ipa, symbols, with, the, exception, of, c, the, letters, j, and, c, are, used, in, a, way, that, is, familiar, to, speakers, of, many, central, and, eastern, european, languages, but, may, be, unfamiliar, to, english, speakers, j, has, the, sound, of, english, y, as, in, y, ellow, and, bo, y, esperanto, jes, has, the, same, pronunciation, as, its, english, cognate, yes, and, c, has, a, ts, sound, as, in, hi, ts, or, the, zz, in, pi, zz, a, in, addition, the, g, in, esperanto, is, always, hard, as, in, g, ift, esperanto, makes, use, of, the, five, vowel, system, essentially, identical, to, the, vowels, of, spanish, and, modern, greek, the, accented, letters, are, according, to, one, of, zamenhof, s, entries, in, the, lingvaj, respondoj, the, letter, n, ought, to, be, pronounced, as, in, all, cases, but, a, rendering, as, is, admissible, before, g, k, and, even, with, the, widespread, adoption, of, unicode, the, letters, with, diacritics, found, in, the, latin, extended, a, section, of, the, unicode, standard, can, cause, problems, with, printing, and, computing, because, they, are, not, found, on, most, physical, keyboards, and, are, left, out, of, certain, fonts, there, are, two, principal, workarounds, to, this, problem, which, substitute, digraphs, for, the, accented, letters, zamenhof, the, inventor, of, esperanto, created, an, h, convention, which, replaces, and, with, ch, gh, hh, jh, sh, and, u, respectively, the, main, issue, with, this, convention, is, its, ambiguity, if, used, in, a, database, a, program, could, not, easily, determine, whether, to, render, for, example, ch, as, c, followed, by, h, or, as, such, words, do, exist, in, esperanto, senchava, could, not, be, rendered, unambiguously, unless, its, component, parts, were, intentionally, separated, as, in, senc, hava, a, more, recent, x, convention, has, also, gained, prominence, with, the, advent, of, computing, utilizing, an, otherwise, absent, x, to, produce, the, digraphs, cx, gx, hx, jx, sx, and, ux, this, has, the, incidental, advantage, of, alphabetizing, correctly, in, most, cases, since, the, only, letter, after, x, is, z, there, are, computer, keyboard, layouts, that, support, the, esperanto, alphabet, and, some, systems, use, software, that, automatically, replaces, x, or, h, convention, digraphs, with, the, corresponding, diacritic, letters, for, example, amiketo, for, microsoft, windows, mac, os, x, and, linux, esperanta, klavaro, for, windows, phone, and, gboard, and, anysoftkeyboard, for, android, on, linux, the, gnome, cinnamon, and, kde, desktop, environments, support, the, entry, of, characters, with, esperanto, diacritics, the, core, vocabulary, of, esperanto, was, defined, by, lingvo, internacia, published, by, zamenhof, in, 1887, this, book, listed, 917, roots, these, could, be, expanded, into, tens, of, thousands, of, words, using, prefixes, suffixes, and, compounding, in, 1894, zamenhof, published, the, first, esperanto, dictionary, universala, vortaro, which, had, a, larger, set, of, roots, the, rules, of, the, language, allowed, speakers, to, borrow, new, roots, as, needed, it, was, recommended, however, that, speakers, use, most, international, forms, and, then, derive, related, meanings, from, these, since, then, many, words, have, been, borrowed, primarily, but, not, solely, from, the, european, languages, not, all, proposed, borrowings, become, widespread, but, many, do, especially, technical, and, scientific, terms, terms, for, everyday, use, on, the, other, hand, are, more, likely, to, be, derived, from, existing, roots, komputilo, computer, for, instance, is, formed, from, the, verb, komputi, compute, and, the, suffix, ilo, tool, words, are, also, calqued, that, is, words, acquire, new, meanings, based, on, usage, in, other, languages, for, example, the, word, muso, mouse, has, acquired, the, meaning, of, a, computer, mouse, from, its, usage, in, many, languages, english, mouse, french, souris, dutch, muis, spanish, rat, n, etc, esperanto, speakers, often, debate, about, whether, a, particular, borrowing, is, justified, or, whether, meaning, can, be, expressed, by, deriving, from, or, extending, the, meaning, of, existing, words, some, compounds, and, formed, words, in, esperanto, are, not, entirely, straightforward, for, example, eldoni, literally, give, out, means, publish, paralleling, the, usage, of, certain, european, languages, such, as, german, herausgeben, dutch, uitgeven, russian, izdat, in, addition, the, suffix, um, has, no, defined, meaning, words, using, the, suffix, must, be, learned, separately, such, as, dekstren, to, the, right, and, dekstrumen, clockwise, there, are, not, many, idiomatic, or, slang, words, in, esperanto, as, these, forms, of, speech, tend, to, make, international, communication, difficult, working, against, esperanto, s, main, goal, the, language, contains, several, calques, of, polish, expressions, instead, of, derivations, of, esperanto, roots, new, roots, are, taken, from, european, languages, in, the, endeavor, to, create, an, international, language, esperanto, words, are, mostly, derived, by, stringing, together, roots, grammatical, endings, and, at, times, prefixes, and, suffixes, this, process, is, regular, so, that, people, can, create, new, words, as, they, speak, and, be, understood, compound, words, are, formed, with, a, modifier, first, head, final, order, as, in, english, compare, birdsong, and, songbird, and, likewise, birdokanto, and, kantobirdo, speakers, may, optionally, insert, an, o, between, the, words, in, a, compound, noun, if, placing, them, together, directly, without, the, o, would, make, the, resulting, word, hard, to, say, or, understand, the, different, parts, of, speech, are, marked, by, their, own, suffixes, all, common, nouns, are, marked, with, the, suffix, o, all, adjectives, with, a, all, derived, adverbs, with, e, and, all, verbs, except, the, jussive, or, imperative, and, infinitive, end, in, s, specifically, in, one, of, six, tense, and, mood, suffixes, such, as, the, present, tense, as, the, jussive, mood, which, is, tenseless, ends, in, u, nouns, and, adjectives, have, two, cases, nominative, for, grammatical, subjects, and, in, general, and, accusative, for, direct, objects, and, after, a, preposition, to, indicate, direction, of, movement, singular, nouns, used, as, grammatical, subjects, end, in, o, plural, subject, nouns, in, oj, pronounced, like, english, oy, singular, direct, object, forms, end, in, on, and, plural, direct, objects, with, the, combination, ojn, rhymes, with, coin, o, indicates, that, the, word, is, a, noun, j, indicates, the, plural, and, n, indicates, the, accusative, direct, object, case, adjectives, agree, with, their, nouns, their, endings, are, singular, subject, a, rhymes, with, ha, plural, subject, aj, pronounced, eye, singular, object, an, and, plural, object, ajn, rhymes, with, fine, the, suffix, n, besides, indicating, the, direct, object, is, used, to, indicate, movement, and, a, few, other, things, as, well, the, six, verb, inflections, consist, of, three, tenses, and, three, moods, they, are, present, tense, as, future, tense, os, past, tense, is, infinitive, mood, i, conditional, mood, us, and, jussive, mood, u, used, for, wishes, and, commands, verbs, are, not, marked, for, person, or, number, thus, kanti, means, to, sing, mi, kantas, means, i, sing, vi, kantas, means, you, sing, and, ili, kantas, means, they, sing, word, order, is, comparatively, free, adjectives, may, precede, or, follow, nouns, subjects, verbs, and, objects, may, occur, in, any, order, however, the, article, la, the, demonstratives, such, as, tiu, that, and, prepositions, such, as, e, at, must, come, before, their, related, nouns, similarly, the, negative, ne, not, and, conjunctions, such, as, kaj, and, and, ke, that, must, precede, the, phrase, or, clause, that, they, introduce, in, copular, a, b, clauses, word, order, is, just, as, important, as, in, english, people, are, animals, is, distinguished, from, animals, are, people, listed, below, are, some, useful, esperanto, words, and, phrases, along, with, ipa, transcriptions, iuj, homoj, estas, denaske, liberaj, kaj, egalaj, la, digno, kaj, rajtoj, ili, posedas, racion, kaj, konsciencon, kaj, devus, konduti, unu, al, alia, en, spirito, de, frateco, all, human, beings, are, born, free, and, equal, in, dignity, and, rights, they, are, endowed, with, reason, and, conscience, and, should, act, towards, one, another, in, a, spirit, of, brotherhood, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, article, i, the, following, short, extract, gives, an, idea, of, the, character, of, esperanto, esperanto, speakers, learn, the, language, through, self, directed, study, online, tutorials, and, correspondence, courses, taught, by, volunteers, more, recently, free, teaching, websites, like, lernu, and, duolingo, have, become, available, esperanto, instruction, is, rarely, available, at, schools, including, four, primary, schools, in, a, pilot, project, under, the, supervision, of, the, university, of, manchester, and, by, one, count, at, a, few, universities, however, outside, china, and, hungary, these, mostly, involve, informal, arrangements, rather, than, dedicated, departments, or, state, sponsorship, e, tv, s, lor, nd, university, in, budapest, had, a, department, of, interlinguistics, and, esperanto, from, 1966, to, 2004, after, which, time, instruction, moved, to, vocational, colleges, there, are, state, examinations, for, esperanto, instructors, additionally, adam, mickiewicz, university, in, poland, offers, a, diploma, in, interlinguistics, the, senate, of, brazil, passed, a, bill, in, 2009, that, would, make, esperanto, an, optional, part, of, the, curriculum, in, public, schools, although, mandatory, if, there, is, demand, for, it, as, of, 2015, the, bill, is, still, under, consideration, by, the, chamber, of, deputies, in, the, united, states, esperanto, is, notably, offered, as, a, weekly, evening, course, at, stanford, university, s, bechtel, international, center, conversational, esperanto, the, international, language, is, a, free, drop, in, class, that, is, open, to, stanford, students, and, the, general, public, on, campus, during, the, academic, year, with, administrative, permission, stanford, students, can, take, the, class, for, two, credits, a, quarter, through, the, linguistics, department, esperanto, usa, suggests, that, esperanto, can, be, learned, in, at, most, one, quarter, of, the, amount, of, time, required, for, other, languages, the, zagreb, method, is, an, esperanto, teaching, method, that, was, developed, in, the, city, of, zagreb, in, the, late, 1970s, to, early, 1980s, as, a, response, to, the, unsatisfactory, learning, outcomes, of, traditional, natural, language, teaching, techniques, when, used, for, esperanto, its, goal, was, to, streamline, the, material, in, order, to, equip, learners, with, practical, knowledge, that, could, be, put, to, use, in, as, short, a, time, frame, as, possible, it, is, now, implemented, and, available, on, some, of, the, well, known, learning, websites, in, the, community, from, 2006, to, 2011, four, primary, schools, in, britain, with, 230, pupils, followed, a, course, in, propaedeutic, esperanto, that, is, instruction, in, esperanto, to, raise, language, awareness, and, to, accelerate, subsequent, learning, of, foreign, languages, under, the, supervision, of, the, university, of, manchester, as, they, put, it, many, schools, used, to, teach, children, the, recorder, not, to, produce, a, nation, of, recorder, players, but, as, a, preparation, for, learning, other, instruments, esperanto, not, to, produce, a, nation, of, esperanto, speakers, but, as, a, preparation, for, learning, other, languages, the, results, showed, that, the, pupils, achieved, enhanced, metalinguistic, awareness, though, the, study, did, not, indicate, whether, a, course, in, a, language, other, than, esperanto, would, have, led, to, similar, results, similar, studies, have, been, conducted, in, new, zealand, the, united, states, england, and, germany, many, of, these, experiments, findings, were, compromised, by, unclear, objectives, brief, or, anecdotal, reporting, and, a, lack, of, methodological, rigor, however, the, results, of, these, studies, were, consistently, favorable, and, suggested, that, studying, esperanto, before, another, foreign, language, expedites, the, acquisition, of, the, other, natural, language, esperanto, is, by, far, the, most, widely, spoken, constructed, language, in, the, world, speakers, are, most, numerous, in, europe, and, east, asia, especially, in, urban, areas, where, they, often, form, esperanto, clubs, esperanto, is, particularly, prevalent, in, the, northern, and, central, countries, of, europe, in, china, korea, japan, and, iran, within, asia, in, brazil, and, the, united, states, in, the, americas, and, in, togo, in, africa, countering, a, common, criticism, against, esperanto, the, statistician, svend, nielsen, has, found, no, significant, correlation, between, the, number, of, esperanto, speakers, and, the, similarity, of, a, given, national, native, language, to, esperanto, he, concludes, that, esperanto, tends, to, be, more, popular, in, rich, countries, with, widespread, internet, access, and, a, tendency, to, contribute, more, to, science, and, culture, linguistic, diversity, within, a, country, was, found, to, have, no, or, perhaps, a, slightly, reductive, correlation, with, esperanto, popularity, an, estimate, of, the, number, of, esperanto, speakers, was, made, by, sidney, s, culbert, a, retired, psychology, professor, at, the, university, of, washington, and, a, longtime, esperantist, who, tracked, down, and, tested, esperanto, speakers, in, sample, areas, in, dozens, of, countries, over, a, period, of, twenty, years, culbert, concluded, that, between, one, and, two, million, people, speak, esperanto, at, foreign, service, level, 3, professionally, proficient, able, to, communicate, moderately, complex, ideas, without, hesitation, and, to, follow, speeches, radio, broadcasts, etc, culbert, s, estimate, was, not, made, for, esperanto, alone, but, formed, part, of, his, listing, of, estimates, for, all, languages, of, more, than, one, million, speakers, published, annually, in, the, world, almanac, and, book, of, facts, culbert, s, most, detailed, account, of, his, methodology, is, found, in, a, 1989, letter, to, david, wolff, since, culbert, never, published, detailed, intermediate, results, for, particular, countries, and, regions, it, is, difficult, to, independently, gauge, the, accuracy, of, his, results, in, the, almanac, his, estimates, for, numbers, of, language, speakers, were, rounded, to, the, nearest, million, thus, the, number, of, esperanto, speakers, is, shown, as, two, million, this, latter, figure, appears, in, ethnologue, assuming, that, this, figure, is, accurate, that, means, that, about, 0, 03, of, the, world, s, population, speaks, the, language, although, it, does, not, meet, zamenhof, s, goal, of, a, universal, language, it, still, represents, a, level, of, popularity, unmatched, by, any, other, constructed, language, marcus, sikosek, now, ziko, van, dijk, has, challenged, this, figure, of, 1, 6, million, as, exaggerated, he, estimated, that, even, if, esperanto, speakers, were, evenly, distributed, assuming, one, million, esperanto, speakers, worldwide, would, lead, one, to, expect, about, 180, in, the, city, of, cologne, van, dijk, finds, only, 30, fluent, speakers, in, that, city, and, similarly, smaller, than, expected, figures, in, several, other, places, thought, to, have, a, larger, than, average, concentration, of, esperanto, speakers, he, also, notes, that, there, are, a, total, of, about, 20, 000, members, of, the, various, esperanto, organizations, other, estimates, are, higher, though, there, are, undoubtedly, many, esperanto, speakers, who, are, not, members, of, any, esperanto, organization, he, thinks, it, unlikely, that, there, are, fifty, times, more, speakers, than, organization, members, in, 1996, finnish, linguist, jouko, lindstedt, an, expert, on, native, born, esperanto, speakers, presented, the, following, scheme, to, show, the, overall, proportions, of, language, capabilities, within, the, esperanto, community, in, 2017, doctoral, student, svend, nielsen, estimated, around, 63, 000, esperanto, speakers, worldwide, taking, into, account, association, memberships, user, generated, data, from, esperanto, websites, and, census, statistics, this, number, however, was, disputed, by, statistician, sten, johansson, who, questioned, the, reliability, of, the, source, data, and, highlighted, a, wide, margin, of, error, the, latter, point, with, which, nielsen, agrees, both, have, stated, however, that, this, new, number, is, likely, more, realistic, than, some, earlier, projections, in, the, absence, of, culbert, s, detailed, sampling, data, or, any, other, census, data, it, is, impossible, to, state, the, number, of, speakers, with, certainty, according, to, the, website, of, the, universal, esperanto, association, numbers, of, textbooks, sold, and, membership, of, local, societies, put, the, number, of, people, with, some, knowledge, of, the, language, in, the, hundreds, of, thousands, and, possibly, millions, native, esperanto, speakers, eo, denaskuloj, lit, person, from, since, birth, have, learned, the, language, from, birth, from, esperanto, speaking, parents, this, usually, happens, when, esperanto, is, the, chief, or, only, common, language, in, an, international, family, but, sometimes, occurs, in, a, family, of, esperanto, speakers, who, often, use, the, language, as, of, 1996, according, to, corsetti, there, were, approximately, 350, attested, cases, of, families, with, native, esperanto, speakers, which, means, there, were, around, 700, esperanto, speaking, natives, in, these, families, not, accounting, for, older, native, speakers, the, 2022, edition, of, ethnologue, gives, 1, 000, l1, users, citing, corsetti, et, al, 2004, however, native, speakers, do, not, occupy, an, authoritative, position, in, the, esperanto, community, as, they, would, in, other, language, communities, this, presents, a, challenge, to, linguists, whose, usual, source, of, grammaticality, and, meanings, are, native, speakers, esperantists, participate, in, an, international, culture, including, a, large, body, of, original, as, well, as, translated, literature, there, are, more, than, 25, 000, esperanto, books, both, originals, and, translations, as, well, as, several, regularly, distributed, esperanto, magazines, in, 2013, a, museum, about, esperanto, opened, in, china, esperantists, use, the, language, for, free, accommodations, with, esperantists, in, 92, countries, using, the, pasporta, servo, or, to, develop, pen, pals, through, esperanto, koresponda, servo, every, year, esperantists, meet, for, the, world, congress, of, esperanto, universala, kongreso, de, esperanto, historically, much, music, has, been, written, in, the, language, such, as, kaj, tiel, plu, there, is, also, a, variety, of, classical, and, semi, classical, choral, music, both, original, and, translated, as, well, as, large, ensemble, music, that, includes, voices, singing, esperanto, texts, lou, harrison, who, incorporated, styles, and, instruments, from, many, world, cultures, in, his, music, used, esperanto, titles, and, or, texts, in, several, of, his, works, most, notably, la, koro, sutro, 1973, david, gaines, used, esperanto, poems, as, well, as, an, excerpt, from, a, speech, by, zamenhof, for, his, symphony, no, one, esperanto, for, mezzo, soprano, and, orchestra, 1994, 98, he, wrote, original, esperanto, text, for, his, povas, plori, mi, ne, plu, i, can, cry, no, longer, for, unaccompanied, satb, choir, 1994, there, are, also, shared, traditions, such, as, zamenhof, day, celebrated, on, december, 15, esperantists, speak, primarily, in, esperanto, at, special, conventions, including, the, world, esperanto, congress, but, also, more, local, conventions, held, for, instance, where, three, or, more, national, languages, meet, proponents, of, esperanto, such, as, humphrey, tonkin, a, professor, at, the, university, of, hartford, argue, that, esperanto, is, culturally, neutral, by, design, as, it, was, intended, to, be, a, facilitator, between, cultures, not, to, be, the, carrier, of, any, one, national, culture, the, late, scottish, esperanto, author, william, auld, wrote, extensively, on, the, subject, arguing, that, esperanto, is, the, expression, of, a, common, human, culture, unencumbered, by, national, frontiers, thus, it, is, considered, a, culture, on, its, own, critics, have, argued, that, the, language, is, eurocentric, as, it, draws, much, of, its, vocabulary, from, european, languages, several, esperanto, associations, also, advance, esperanto, education, and, aim, to, preserve, its, culture, and, heritage, poland, added, esperanto, to, its, list, of, intangible, cultural, heritage, in, 2014, in, the, futuristic, novel, lord, of, the, world, by, robert, hugh, benson, esperanto, is, presented, as, the, predominant, language, of, the, world, much, as, latin, is, the, language, of, the, church, a, reference, to, esperanto, appears, in, the, science, fiction, story, war, with, the, newts, by, karel, apek, published, in, 1936, as, part, of, a, passage, on, what, language, the, salamander, looking, creatures, with, human, cognitive, ability, should, learn, it, is, noted, that, in, the, reform, schools, esperanto, was, taught, as, the, medium, of, communication, p, 206, esperanto, has, been, used, in, many, films, and, novels, typically, this, is, done, either, to, add, the, exotic, flavour, of, a, foreign, language, without, representing, any, particular, ethnicity, or, to, avoid, going, to, the, trouble, of, inventing, a, new, language, the, charlie, chaplin, film, the, great, dictator, 1940, showed, jewish, ghetto, shop, signs, in, esperanto, two, full, length, feature, films, have, been, produced, with, dialogue, entirely, in, esperanto, angoroj, in, 1964, and, incubus, a, 1965, b, movie, horror, film, which, is, also, notable, for, starring, william, shatner, shortly, before, he, began, working, on, star, trek, in, captain, fantastic, 2016, there, is, a, dialogue, in, esperanto, the, 1994, film, street, fighter, contains, esperanto, dialogue, spoken, by, the, character, sagat, finally, mexican, film, director, alfonso, cuar, n, has, publicly, shown, his, fascination, for, esperanto, going, as, far, as, naming, his, film, production, company, esperanto, filmoj, esperanto, films, in, 1921, the, french, academy, of, sciences, recommended, using, esperanto, for, international, scientific, communication, a, few, scientists, and, mathematicians, such, as, maurice, fr, chet, mathematics, john, c, wells, linguistics, helmar, frank, pedagogy, and, cybernetics, and, nobel, laureate, reinhard, selten, economics, have, published, part, of, their, work, in, esperanto, frank, and, selten, were, among, the, founders, of, the, international, academy, of, sciences, in, san, marino, sometimes, called, the, esperanto, university, where, esperanto, is, the, primary, language, of, teaching, and, administration, a, message, in, esperanto, was, recorded, and, included, in, voyager, 1, s, golden, record, esperanto, business, groups, have, been, active, for, many, years, research, conducted, in, the, 1920s, by, the, french, chamber, of, commerce, and, reported, in, the, new, york, times, suggested, that, esperanto, seemed, to, be, the, best, business, language, the, privacy, oriented, cryptocurrency, monero, takes, its, name, from, the, esperanto, word, for, coin, zamenhof, had, three, goals, as, he, wrote, already, in, 1887, to, create, an, easy, language, to, create, a, language, ready, to, use, whether, the, language, be, universally, accepted, or, not, and, to, find, some, means, to, get, many, people, to, learn, the, language, so, zamenhof, s, intention, was, not, only, to, create, an, easy, to, learn, language, to, foster, peace, and, international, understanding, as, a, general, language, but, also, to, create, a, language, for, immediate, use, by, a, small, language, community, esperanto, was, to, serve, as, an, international, auxiliary, language, that, is, as, a, universal, second, language, not, to, replace, ethnic, languages, this, goal, was, shared, by, zamenhof, among, esperanto, speakers, at, the, beginning, of, the, movement, later, esperanto, speakers, began, to, see, the, language, and, the, culture, that, had, grown, up, around, it, as, ends, in, themselves, even, if, esperanto, is, never, adopted, by, the, united, nations, or, other, international, organizations, esperanto, speakers, who, want, to, see, esperanto, adopted, officially, or, on, a, large, scale, worldwide, are, commonly, called, finvenkistoj, from, fina, venko, meaning, final, victory, there, are, two, kinds, of, finvenkismo, desubismo, aims, to, spread, esperanto, between, ordinary, people, desube, from, below, to, form, a, steadily, growing, community, of, esperanto, speakers, while, desuprismo, aims, to, act, from, above, desupre, beginning, with, politicians, zamenhof, considered, the, first, way, more, plausible, as, for, such, affairs, as, ours, governments, come, with, their, approval, and, help, usually, only, when, everything, is, completely, ready, those, who, focus, on, the, intrinsic, value, of, the, language, are, commonly, called, ra, mistoj, from, rauma, finland, where, a, declaration, on, the, short, term, improbability, of, the, fina, venko, and, the, value, of, esperanto, culture, was, made, at, the, international, youth, congress, in, 1980, however, the, manifesto, de, ra, mo, clearly, mentions, the, intention, to, further, spread, the, language, we, want, to, spread, esperanto, to, put, into, effect, its, positive, values, more, and, more, step, by, step, in, 1996, the, prague, manifesto, was, adopted, at, the, annual, congress, of, the, universal, esperanto, association, uea, it, was, subscribed, by, individual, participants, and, later, by, other, esperanto, speakers, more, recently, language, learning, apps, like, duolingo, and, amikumu, have, helped, to, increase, the, amount, of, fluent, speakers, of, esperanto, and, find, others, in, their, area, to, speak, the, language, with, the, earliest, flag, and, the, one, most, commonly, used, today, features, a, green, five, pointed, star, against, a, white, canton, upon, a, field, of, green, it, was, proposed, to, zamenhof, by, richard, geoghegan, author, of, the, first, esperanto, textbook, for, english, speakers, in, 1887, the, flag, was, approved, in, 1905, by, delegates, to, the, first, conference, of, esperantists, at, boulogne, sur, mer, the, green, star, on, white, la, verda, stelo, is, also, used, by, itself, as, a, round, buttonhole, etc, emblem, by, many, esperantists, among, other, reasons, to, enhance, their, visibility, outside, the, esperanto, world, a, version, with, an, e, superimposed, over, the, green, star, is, sometimes, seen, other, variants, include, that, for, christian, esperantists, with, a, white, christian, cross, superimposed, upon, the, green, star, and, that, for, leftists, with, the, color, of, the, field, changed, from, green, to, red, in, 1987, a, second, flag, design, was, chosen, in, a, contest, organized, by, the, uea, celebrating, the, first, centennial, of, the, language, it, featured, a, white, background, with, two, stylised, curved, e, s, facing, each, other, dubbed, the, jubilea, simbolo, jubilee, symbol, it, attracted, criticism, from, some, esperantists, who, dubbed, it, the, melono, melon, for, its, elliptical, shape, it, is, still, in, use, though, to, a, lesser, degree, than, the, traditional, symbol, known, as, the, verda, stelo, green, star, esperanto, has, been, placed, in, many, proposed, political, situations, the, most, popular, of, these, is, the, europe, democracy, esperanto, which, aims, to, establish, esperanto, as, the, official, language, of, the, european, union, grin, s, report, published, in, 2005, by, fran, ois, grin, found, that, the, use, of, english, as, the, lingua, franca, within, the, european, union, costs, billions, annually, and, significantly, benefits, english, speaking, countries, financially, the, report, considered, a, scenario, where, esperanto, would, be, the, lingua, franca, and, found, that, it, would, have, many, advantages, particularly, economically, speaking, as, well, as, ideologically, left, wing, currents, exist, in, the, wider, esperanto, world, mostly, organized, through, the, sennacieca, asocio, tutmonda, founded, by, french, theorist, eug, ne, lanti, other, notable, esperanto, socialists, include, nikolai, nekrasov, and, vladimir, varankin, both, of, whom, were, put, to, death, in, october, 1938, during, the, stalinist, repressions, nekrasov, was, accused, of, being, an, organizer, and, leader, of, a, fascist, espionage, terrorist, organization, of, esperantists, the, oomoto, religion, encourages, the, use, of, esperanto, among, its, followers, and, includes, zamenhof, as, one, of, its, deified, spirits, the, bah, faith, encourages, the, use, of, an, auxiliary, international, language, abdu, l, bah, praised, the, ideal, of, esperanto, and, there, was, an, affinity, between, esperantists, and, bah, s, during, the, late, 19th, century, and, early, 20th, century, on, february, 12, 1913, abdu, l, bah, gave, a, talk, to, the, paris, esperanto, society, stating, now, praise, be, to, god, that, dr, zamenhof, has, invented, the, esperanto, language, it, has, all, the, potential, qualities, of, becoming, the, international, means, of, communication, all, of, us, must, be, grateful, and, thankful, to, him, for, this, noble, effort, for, in, this, way, he, has, served, his, fellowmen, well, with, untiring, effort, and, self, sacrifice, on, the, part, of, its, devotees, esperanto, will, become, universal, therefore, every, one, of, us, must, study, this, language, and, spread, it, as, far, as, possible, so, that, day, by, day, it, may, receive, a, broader, recognition, be, accepted, by, all, nations, and, governments, of, the, world, and, become, a, part, of, the, curriculum, in, all, the, public, schools, i, hope, that, esperanto, will, be, adopted, as, the, language, of, all, the, future, international, conferences, and, congresses, so, that, all, people, need, acquire, only, two, languages, one, their, own, tongue, and, the, other, the, international, language, then, perfect, union, will, be, established, between, all, the, people, of, the, world, consider, how, difficult, it, is, today, to, communicate, with, various, nations, if, one, studies, fifty, languages, one, may, yet, travel, through, a, country, and, not, know, the, language, therefore, i, hope, that, you, will, make, the, utmost, effort, so, that, this, language, of, esperanto, may, be, widely, spread, lidia, zamenhof, daughter, of, l, l, zamenhof, became, a, bah, around, 1925, james, ferdinand, morton, jr, an, early, member, of, the,

abdu, l, bah, agnes, baldwin, alexander, became, an, early, advocate, of, esperanto, and, used, it, to, spread, the, bah, teachings, at, meetings, and, conferences, in, japan, today, there, exists,

use, of, esperanto, in, a, central, magazine, for, all, spiritists, and, esperantists, esperanto, then, became, actively, promoted, by, spiritists, at, least, in, brazil, initially, by, ismael, gomes, braga, and, franti, ek, lorenz, the, latter, is, known, in, brazil, as, francisco, valdomiro, lorenz, and, was, a, pioneer, of, both, spiritist, and, esperantist, movements, in, this, country, the,

tanakh, or, old, testament, done, by, l, l, zamenhof, the, translation, was, reviewed, and, compared, with, other, languages, translations, by, a, group, of, british, clergy, and, scholars, before, its, publication, at, the, british, and, foreign, bible, society, in, 1910, in, 1926, this, was, published, along, with, a, new, testament, translation, in, an, edition, commonly, called, the, londona, biblio, in, the, 1960s, the, internacia, asocio, de, bibliistoj, kaj, orientalistoj, tried, to, organize, a, new, ecumenical, esperanto, bible, version, since, then, the, dutch, remonstrant, pastor, gerrit, berveling, has, translated, the, deuterocanonical, or, apocryphal, books, in, addition, to, new, translations, of, the, gospels, some, of, the, new, testament, epistles, and, some, books, of, the, tanakh, these, have, been, published, in, various, separate, booklets, or, serialized, in, dia, regno, but, the, deuterocanonical, books, have, appeared, in, recent, editions, of, the, londona, biblio, christian, esperanto, organizations, and, publications, include, ayatollah, khomeini, of, iran, called, on, muslims, to, learn, esperanto, and, praised, its, use, as, a, medium, for, better, understanding, among, peoples, of, different, religious, backgrounds, after, he, suggested, that, esperanto, replace, english, as, an, international, lingua, franca, it, began, to, be, used, in, the, seminaries, of, qom, an, esperanto, translation, of, the, qur, an, was, published, by, the, state, shortly, thereafter, though, esperanto, itself, has, changed, little, since, the, publication, of, fundamento, de, esperanto, foundation, of, esperanto, a, number, of, reform, projects, have, been, proposed, over, the, years, starting, with, zamenhof, s, proposals, in, 1894, and, ido, in, 1907, several, later, constructed, languages, such, as, universal, saussure, rom, ni, o, internasia, esperanto, sen, fleksio, and, mundolingvo, were, all, based, on, esperanto, in, modern, times, conscious, attempts, have, been, made, to, eliminate, perceived, sexism, in, the, language, such, as, riism, many, words, with, now, have, alternative, spellings, with, k, and, occasionally, h, so, that, ar, itekto, may, also, be, spelled, arkitekto, see, esperanto, phonology, for, further, details, of, replacement, reforms, aimed, at, altering, country, names, have, also, resulted, in, a, number, of, different, options, either, due, to, disputes, over, suffixes, or, eurocentrism, in, naming, various, countries, j, r, r, tolkien, wrote, in, support, of, the, language, in, a, 1932, british, esperantist, article, but, criticised, those, who, sought, to, adapt, or, tinker, with, the, language, which, in, his, opinion, harmed, unanimity, and, the, goal, of, achieving, wide, acceptance, there, have, been, numerous, objections, to, esperanto, over, the, years, for, example, there, has, been, criticism, that, esperanto, is, not, neutral, enough, but, also, that, it, should, convey, a, specific, culture, which, would, make, it, less, neutral, that, esperanto, does, not, draw, on, a, wide, enough, selection, of, the, world, s, languages, but, also, that, it, should, be, more, narrowly, european, esperantists, often, argue, for, esperanto, as, a, culturally, neutral, means, of, communication, however, it, is, often, accused, of, being, eurocentric, this, is, most, often, noted, in, regard, to, the, vocabulary, the, vocabulary, for, example, draws, about, three, quarters, from, romance, languages, and, the, remainder, primarily, from, german, greek, and, slavic, languages, speakers, have, argued, that, the, agglutinative, grammar, and, verb, regularity, of, esperanto, has, more, in, common, with, asian, languages, than, with, european, ones, a, 2010, linguistic, typological, study, concluded, that, esperanto, is, indeed, somewhat, european, in, character, but, considerably, less, so, than, the, european, languages, themselves, esperanto, is, sometimes, accused, of, being, inherently, sexist, because, the, default, form, of, some, nouns, is, used, for, descriptions, of, men, while, a, derived, form, is, used, for, the, women, this, is, said, to, retain, traces, of, the, male, dominated, society, of, late, 19th, century, europe, of, which, esperanto, is, a, product, these, nouns, are, primarily, titles, such, as, baron, baroness, and, kinship, terms, such, as, sinjoro, mr, sir, vs, sinjorino, ms, lady, and, patro, father, vs, patrino, mother, before, the, movement, toward, equal, rights, for, women, this, also, applied, to, professional, roles, assumed, to, be, predominantly, male, such, as, doktoro, a, holder, of, a, doctorate, male, or, unspecified, versus, doktorino, a, female, doctorate, holder, this, paralleled, the, contemporary, situation, with, the, english, suffix, ess, as, in, the, words, waiter, waitress, actor, actress, etc, on, the, other, hand, the, pronoun, i, it, may, be, used, generically, to, mean, he, she, they, the, pronoun, li, he, is, always, masculine, and, i, she, is, always, female, despite, some, authors, arguments, a, gender, neutral, singular, pronoun, ri, has, gradually, become, more, widely, used, in, recent, years, although, it, is, minority, usage, the, plural, pronoun, ili, they, is, always, neutral, while, nouns, with, the, prefix, ge, specifically, includes, both, sexes, for, example, gesinjoroj, equivalent, depending, on, context, to, either, sinjoro, kaj, sinjorino, mr, and, ms, or, sinjoroj, kaj, sinjorinoj, ladies, and, gentlemen, gepatroj, parents, equivalent, to, patro, kaj, patrino, mother, and, father, speakers, of, languages, without, grammatical, case, or, adjectival, agreement, frequently, criticise, these, aspects, of, esperanto, in, addition, in, the, past, some, people, found, the, classical, greek, forms, of, the, plural, nouns, in, oj, adjectives, in, aj, to, be, awkward, proposing, instead, that, italian, i, be, used, for, nouns, and, that, no, plural, be, used, for, adjectives, these, suggestions, were, adopted, by, the, ido, reform, a, reply, to, that, criticism, is, that, the, presence, of, an, accusative, case, allows, much, freedom, in, word, order, e, g, for, emphasis, johano, batis, petron, john, hit, peter, petron, batis, johano, it, is, peter, whom, john, hit, that, its, absence, in, the, predicate, of, the, object, avoids, ambiguity, mi, vidis, la, blankan, domon, i, saw, the, white, house, mi, vidis, la, domon, blanka, the, house, seemed, white, to, me, and, that, adjective, agreement, allows, among, others, the, use, of, hyperbaton, in, poetry, as, in, latin, cf, virgil, s, eclogue, 1, 1, tityre, tu, patul, recubans, sub, tegmine, fagi, where, patul, spread, out, is, epithet, to, fagi, beech, and, their, agreement, in, the, genitive, feminine, binds, them, notwithstanding, their, distance, in, the, verse, the, esperanto, alphabet, uses, two, diacritics, the, circumflex, and, the, breve, the, alphabet, was, designed, with, a, french, typewriter, in, mind, and, although, modern, computers, support, unicode, entering, the, letters, with, diacritic, marks, can, be, more, or, less, problematic, with, certain, operating, systems, or, hardware, one, of, the, first, reform, proposals, for, esperanto, 1894, sought, to, do, away, with, these, marks, and, the, language, ido, went, back, to, the, basic, latin, alphabet, one, common, criticism, is, that, esperanto, has, failed, to, live, up, to, the, hopes, of, its, creator, who, dreamed, of, it, becoming, a, universal, second, language, because, people, were, reluctant, to, learn, a, new, language, which, hardly, anyone, spoke, zamenhof, asked, people, to, sign, a, promise, to, start, learning, esperanto, once, ten, million, people, made, the, same, promise, he, was, disappointed, to, receive, only, a, thousand, responses, however, zamenhof, had, the, goal, to, enable, the, learner, to, make, direct, use, of, his, knowledge, with, persons, of, any, nationality, whether, the, language, be, universally, accepted, or, not, as, he, wrote, in, 1887, the, language, is, currently, spoken, by, people, living, in, more, than, 100, countries, there, are, about, 2, 000, native, esperanto, speakers, and, probably, up, to, 100, 000, people, who, use, the, language, regularly, in, this, regard, zamenhof, was, well, aware, that, it, might, take, much, time, for, esperanto, to, achieve, his, desired, goals, in, his, speech, at, the, 1907, world, esperanto, congress, in, cambridge, he, said, we, hope, that, earlier, or, later, maybe, after, many, centuries, on, a, neutral, language, foundation, understanding, one, another, the, nations, will, build, a, big, family, circle, the, poet, wis, awa, szymborska, expressed, doubt, that, esperanto, could, produce, works, of, lasting, value, saying, it, is, an, artificial, language, without, variety, or, dialects, esperantists, have, replied, that, lasting, value, is, a, statement, of, opinion, and, that, esperanto, grew, naturally, by, the, actions, of, its, speakers, on, zamenhof, s, intentionally, elementary, fundamento, there, are, some, geographical, and, astronomical, features, named, after, esperanto, or, after, its, creator, l, l, zamenhof, these, include, esperanto, island, in, antarctica, and, the, asteroids, 1421, esperanto,
