to, many, scholars, of, historical, and, academic, importance, the, university, was, founded, on, march, 12, 1365, by, rudolf, iv, duke, of, austria, hence, the, name, alma, mater, rudolphina, after, the, charles, university, in, prague, 1347, and, jagiellonian, university, in, krak, w, 1364, the, university, of, vienna, is, the, third, oldest, university, in, central, europe, and, the, oldest, university, in, the, contemporary, german, speaking, world, it, remains, a, question, of, definition, as, the, charles, university, in, prague, was, german, speaking, when, founded, too, however, pope, urban, v, did, not, ratify, the, deed, of, foundation, that, had, been, sanctioned, by, rudolf, iv, specifically, in, relation, to, the, department, of, theology, this, was, presumably, due, to, pressure, exerted, by, charles, iv, holy, roman, emperor, who, wished, to, avoid, competition, for, the, charles, university, in, prague, the, pope, later, granted, an, endowment, to, the, university, in, 1365, while, papal, assent, was, finally, received, in, 1384, this, led, to, the, university, of, vienna, and, its, faculty, of, catholic, theology, being, granted, the, status, of, a, full, university, the, first, university, building, opened, in, 1385, it, grew, into, the, biggest, university, of, the, holy, roman, empire, and, during, the, advent, of, humanism, in, the, mid, 15th, century, was, home, to, more, than, 6, 000, students, in, its, early, years, the, university, had, a, partly, hierarchical, partly, cooperative, structure, in, which, the, rector, was, at, the, top, while, the, students, had, little, say, and, were, settled, at, the, bottom, the, magister, and, doctors, constituted, the, four, faculties, and, elected, the, academic, officials, from, amidst, their, ranks, the, students, but, also, all, other, supposita, university, members, were, divided, into, four, academic, nations, their, elected, board, members, mostly, graduates, themselves, had, the, right, to, elect, the, rector, he, presided, over, the, consistory, which, included, procurators, of, each, of, the, nations, and, the, faculty, deans, as, well, as, over, the, university, assembly, in, which, all, university, teachers, participated, complaints, or, appeals, against, decisions, of, the, faculty, by, the, students, had, to, be, brought, forward, by, a, magister, or, doctor, being, considered, a, papal, institution, the, university, suffered, a, setback, during, the, reformation, in, addition, epidemics, economic, stagnation, and, the, first, siege, of, vienna, by, ottoman, forces, had, devastating, effects, on, the, city, leading, to, a, sharp, decline, in, enrollment, for, emperor, ferdinand, i, this, meant, that, the, university, should, be, tied, to, the, church, to, an, even, stronger, degree, and, in, 1551, he, installed, the, jesuit, order, there, as, time, went, on, conflicts, between, the, jesuit, school, and, the, university, arose, this, led, emperor, ferdinand, ii, in, 1623, to, pass, a, law, that, incorporated, the, jesuit, college, into, the, university, it, was, only, in, the, mid, 18th, century, that, the, jesuits, lost, influence, over, the, university, and, when, empress, maria, theresa, ensured, that, the, university, went, under, the, control, of, the, monarchy, the, university, would, later, focus, on, the, education, of, physicians, and, civil, servants, her, successor, joseph, ii, continued, her, reforms, and, further, liberalized, the, university, abolishing, official, attire, and, allowing, both, protestants, and, jews, to, enroll, by, 1782, as, well, as, introducing, german, as, the, compulsory, language, of, instruction, the, year, later, significant, changes, were, instituted, in, the, wake, of, the, revolution, in, 1848, with, the, philosophical, faculty, being, upgraded, into, equal, status, as, theology, law, and, medicine, led, by, the, reforms, of, leopold, count, von, thun, und, hohenstein, the, university, was, able, to, achieve, a, larger, degree, of, academic, freedom, the, current, main, building, on, the, ringstra, e, was, built, between, 1877, and, 1884, by,
