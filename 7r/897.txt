aerial, warfare, is, the, use, of, military, aircraft, and, other, flying, machines, in, warfare, aerial, warfare, includes, bombers, attacking, enemy, installations, or, a, concentration, of, enemy, troops, or, strategic, targets, fighter, aircraft, battling, for, control, of, airspace, attack, aircraft, engaging, in, close, air, support, against, ground, targets, naval, aviation, flying, against, sea, and, nearby, land, targets, gliders, helicopters, and, other, aircraft, to, carry, airborne, forces, such, as, paratroopers, aerial, refueling, tankers, to, extend, operation, time, or, range, and, military, transport, aircraft, to, move, cargo, and, personnel, historically, military, aircraft, have, included, lighter, than, air, balloons, carrying, artillery, observers, lighter, than, air, airships, for, bombing, cities, various, sorts, of, reconnaissance, surveillance, and, early, warning, aircraft, carrying, observers, cameras, and, radar, equipment, torpedo, bombers, to, attack, enemy, vessels, and, military, air, sea, rescue, aircraft, for, saving, downed, airmen, modern, aerial, warfare, includes, missiles, and, unmanned, aerial, vehicles, surface, forces, are, likely, to, respond, to, enemy, air, activity, with, anti, aircraft, warfare, the, history, of, aerial, warfare, began, in, ancient, times, with, the, use, of, man, carrying, kites, in, ancient, china, in, the, third, century, it, progressed, to, balloon, warfare, airships, notably, zeppelins, served, in, military, use, in, the, early, years, of, the, 20th, century, heavier, than, air, airplanes, first, went, to, war, in, the, italo, turkish, war, in, 1911, initially, for, aerial, reconnaissance, and, then, for, aerial, combat, to, shoot, down, enemy, reconnaissance, planes, aircraft, continued, to, carry, out, these, roles, during, world, war, i, 1914, 1918, where, the, use, of, planes, and, zeppelins, for, strategic, bombing, also, emerged, the, rise, of, fighter, aircraft, and, of, air, to, air, combat, led, to, a, realisation, of, the, desirability, of, achieving, air, superiority, closer, integration, of, attacking, aircraft, with, ground, operations, battlefield, support, also, developed, during, world, war, i, during, world, war, ii, 1939, 1945, the, use, of, strategic, bombing, increased, while, airborne, forces, missiles, and, early, precision, guided, munitions, were, introduced, aircraft, carriers, gained, particular, importance, in, the, trans, oceanic, projection, of, air, power, ballistic, missiles, became, of, key, importance, during, the, cold, war, were, armed, with, nuclear, warheads, and, were, stockpiled, by, the, united, states, and, the, soviet, union, to, deter, each, other, from, using, them, drone, warfare, using, relatively, cheap, unmanned, equipment, proliferated, in, the, 21st, century, particularly, after, the, start, of, the, second, nagorno, karabakh, war, in, 2020, aerial, reconnaissance, is, reconnaissance, for, a, military, or, strategic, purpose, that, is, conducted, using, reconnaissance, aircraft, this, role, can, fulfil, a, variety, of, requirements, including, the, collection, of, imagery, intelligence, observation, of, enemy, maneuvers, and, artillery, spotting, air, combat, manoeuvring, also, known, as, acm, or, dogfighting, is, the, tactical, art, of, moving, turning, and, situating, a, fighter, aircraft, in, order, to, attain, a, position, from, which, an, attack, can, be, made, on, another, aircraft, it, relies, on, offensive, and, defensive, basic, fighter, manoeuvring, bfm, to, gain, an, advantage, over, an, aerial, opponent, airborne, forces, are, military, units, usually, light, infantry, set, up, to, be, moved, by, aircraft, and, dropped, into, battle, typically, by, parachute, thus, they, can, be, placed, behind, enemy, lines, and, have, the, capability, to, deploy, almost, anywhere, with, little, warning, the, formations, are, limited, only, by, the, number, and, size, of, their, aircraft, so, given, enough, capacity, a, huge, force, can, appear, out, of, nowhere, in, minutes, an, action, referred, to, as, vertical, envelopment, conversely, airborne, forces, typically, lack, the, supplies, and, equipment, for, prolonged, combat, operations, and, are, therefore, more, suited, for, airhead, operations, than, for, long, term, occupation, furthermore, parachute, operations, are, particularly, sensitive, to, adverse, weather, conditions, advances, in, helicopter, technology, since, world, war, ii, have, brought, increased, flexibility, to, the, scope, of, airborne, operations, and, air, assaults, have, largely, replaced, large, scale, parachute, operations, and, almost, completely, replaced, combat, glider, operations, an, airstrike, or, air, strike, is, an, offensive, operation, carried, out, by, attack, aircraft, air, strikes, are, mostly, delivered, from, aircraft, such, as, fighters, bombers, ground, attack, aircraft, and, attack, helicopters, the, official, definition, includes, all, sorts, of, targets, including, enemy, air, targets, but, in, popular, use, the, term, is, usually, narrowed, to, a, tactical, small, scale, attack, on, a, ground, or, naval, objective, weapons, used, in, an, airstrike, can, range, from, machine, gun, bullets, and, missiles, to, various, types, of, bombs, it, is, also, commonly, referred, to, as, an, air, raid, in, close, air, support, air, strikes, are, usually, controlled, by, trained, observers, for, coordination, with, friendly, ground, troops, in, a, manner, derived, from, artillery, tactics, strategic, bombing, is, a, military, strategy, used, in, a, total, war, with, the, goal, of, defeating, the, enemy, by, destroying, their, morale, or, their, economic, ability, to, produce, and, transport, materiel, to, the, theatres, of, military, operations, or, both, it, is, a, systematically, organized, and, executed, attack, from, the, air, which, can, utilize, strategic, bombers, long, or, medium, range, missiles, or, nuclear, armed, fighter, bomber, aircraft, to, attack, targets, deemed, vital, to, the, enemy, s, war, making, capability, anti, aircraft, warfare, or, counter, air, defence, is, defined, by, nato, as, all, measures, designed, to, nullify, or, reduce, the, effectiveness, of, hostile, air, action, they, include, ground, and, air, based, weapon, systems, associated, sensor, systems, command, and, control, arrangements, and, passive, measures, e, g, barrage, balloons, it, may, be, used, to, protect, naval, ground, and, air, forces, in, any, location, however, for, most, countries, the, main, effort, has, tended, to, be, homeland, defence, nato, refers, to, airborne, air, defence, as, counter, air, and, naval, air, defence, as, anti, aircraft, warfare, missile, defence, is, an, extension, of, air, defence, as, are, initiatives, to, adapt, air, defence, to, the, task, of, intercepting, any, projectile, in, flight, in, modern, usage, a, missile, is, a, self, propelled, precision, guided, munition, system, as, opposed, to, an, unguided, self, propelled, munition, referred, to, as, a, rocket, although, these, too, can, also, be, guided, missiles, have, four, system, components, targeting, and, or, missile, guidance, flight, system, engine, and, warhead, missiles, come, in, types, adapted, for, different, purposes, surface, to, surface, and, air, to, surface, missiles, ballistic, cruise, anti, ship, anti, tank, etc, surface, to, air, missiles, and, anti, ballistic, air, to, air, missiles, and, anti, satellite, weapons, all, known, existing, missiles, are, designed, to, be, propelled, during, powered, flight, by, chemical, reactions, inside, a, rocket, engine, jet, engine, or, other, type, of, engine, non, self, propelled, airborne, explosive, devices, are, generally, referred, to, as, shells, and, usually, have, a, shorter, range, than, missiles, in, ordinary, british, english, usage, predating, guided, weapons, a, missile, is, any, thrown, object, such, as, objects, thrown, at, players, by, rowdy, spectators, at, a, sporting, event, the, advent, of, the, unmanned, aerial, vehicle, has, dramatically, revolutionized, aerial, warfare, with, multiple, nations, developing, and, or, purchasing, uav, fleets, several, benchmarks, have, already, occurred, including, a, uav, fighter, jet, dogfight, probes, of, adversary, air, defense, with, uavs, replacement, of, an, operational, flight, wing, s, aircraft, with, uavs, control, of, uavs, qualifying, the, operator, for, combat, status, uav, control, from, the, other, side, of, the, world, jamming, and, or, data, hijacking, of, uavs, in, flight, as, well, as, proposals, to, transfer, fire, authority, to, ai, aboard, a, uav, uavs, have, quickly, evolved, from, surveillance, to, combat, roles, the, growing, capability, of, uavs, has, thrown, into, question, the, survivability, and, capability, of, manned, fighter,
