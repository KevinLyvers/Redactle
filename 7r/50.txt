https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protectionism
protectionism, sometimes, referred, to, as, trade, protectionism, is, the, economic, policy, of, restricting, imports, from, other, countries, through, methods, such, as, tariffs, on, imported, goods, import, quotas, and, a, variety, of, other, government, regulations, proponents, argue, that, protectionist, policies, shield, the, producers, businesses, and, workers, of, the, import, competing, sector, in, the, country, from, foreign, competitors, and, raise, government, revenue, opponents, argue, that, protectionist, policies, reduce, trade, and, adversely, affect, consumers, in, general, by, raising, the, cost, of, imported, goods, as, well, as, the, producers, and, workers, in, export, sectors, both, in, the, country, implementing, protectionist, policies, and, in, the, countries, against, which, the, protections, are, implemented, protectionism, has, been, advocated, mainly, by, parties, that, hold, economic, nationalist, positions, while, economically, liberal, political, parties, generally, support, free, trade, there, is, a, consensus, among, economists, that, protectionism, has, a, negative, effect, on, economic, growth, and, economic, welfare, while, free, trade, and, the, reduction, of, trade, barriers, have, a, significantly, positive, effect, on, economic, growth, some, scholars, such, as, douglas, irwin, have, implicated, protectionism, as, the, cause, of, some, economic, crises, most, notably, the, great, depression, although, trade, liberalization, can, sometimes, result, in, large, and, unequally, distributed, losses, and, gains, and, can, in, the, short, run, cause, significant, economic, dislocation, of, workers, in, import, competing, sectors, free, trade, often, lowers, the, costs, of, goods, and, services, for, both, producers, and, consumers, a, variety, of, policies, have, been, used, to, achieve, protectionist, goals, these, include, in, the, modern, trade, arena, many, other, initiatives, besides, tariffs, have, been, called, protectionist, for, example, some, commentators, such, as, jagdish, bhagwati, see, developed, countries, efforts, in, imposing, their, own, labor, or, environmental, standards, as, protectionism, also, the, imposition, of, restrictive, certification, procedures, on, imports, is, seen, in, this, light, further, others, point, out, that, free, trade, agreements, often, have, protectionist, provisions, such, as, intellectual, property, copyright, and, patent, restrictions, that, benefit, large, corporations, these, provisions, restrict, trade, in, music, movies, pharmaceuticals, software, and, other, manufactured, items, to, high, cost, producers, with, quotas, from, low, cost, producers, set, to, zero, in, the, 18th, century, adam, smith, famously, warned, against, the, interested, sophistry, of, industry, seeking, to, gain, an, advantage, at, the, cost, of, the, consumers, friedrich, list, saw, adam, smith, s, views, on, free, trade, as, disingenuous, believing, that, smith, advocated, for, free, trade, so, that, british, industry, could, lock, out, underdeveloped, foreign, competition, some, have, argued, that, no, major, country, has, ever, successfully, industrialized, without, some, form, of, economic, protection, economic, historian, paul, bairoch, wrote, that, historically, free, trade, is, the, exception, and, protectionism, the, rule, according, to, economic, historians, douglas, irwin, and, kevin, o, rourke, shocks, that, emanate, from, brief, financial, crises, tend, to, be, transitory, and, have, a, little, long, run, effect, on, trade, policy, whereas, those, that, play, out, over, longer, periods, the, early, 1890s, early, 1930s, may, give, rise, to, protectionism, that, is, difficult, to, reverse, regional, wars, also, produce, transitory, shocks, that, have, little, impact, on, long, run, trade, policy, while, global, wars, give, rise, to, extensive, government, trade, restrictions, that, can, be, difficult, to, reverse, one, study, shows, that, sudden, shifts, in, comparative, advantage, for, specific, countries, have, led, some, countries, to, become, protectionist, the, shift, in, comparative, advantage, associated, with, the, opening, up, of, new, world, frontiers, and, the, subsequent, grain, invasion, of, europe, led, to, higher, agricultural, tariffs, from, the, late, 1870s, onwards, which, as, we, have, seen, reversed, the, move, toward, freer, trade, that, had, characterized, mid, nineteenth, century, europe, in, the, decades, after, world, war, ii, japan, s, rapid, rise, led, to, trade, friction, with, other, countries, japan, s, recovery, was, accompanied, by, a, sharp, increase, in, its, exports, of, certain, product, categories, cotton, textiles, in, the, 1950s, steel, in, the, 1960s, automobiles, in, the, 1970s, and, electronics, in, the, 1980s, in, each, case, the, rapid, expansion, in, japan, s, exports, created, difficulties, for, its, trading, partners, and, the, use, of, protectionism, as, a, shock, absorber, according, to, economic, historian, douglas, irwin, a, common, myth, about, us, trade, policy, is, that, low, tariffs, harmed, american, manufacturers, in, the, early, 19th, century, and, then, that, high, tariffs, made, the, united, states, into, a, great, industrial, power, in, the, late, 19th, century, a, review, by, the, economist, of, irwin, s, 2017, book, clashing, over, commerce, a, history, of, us, trade, policy, states, political, dynamics, would, lead, people, to, see, a, link, between, tariffs, and, the, economic, cycle, that, was, not, there, a, boom, would, generate, enough, revenue, for, tariffs, to, fall, and, when, the, bust, came, pressure, would, build, to, raise, them, again, by, the, time, that, happened, the, economy, would, be, recovering, giving, the, impression, that, tariff, cuts, caused, the, crash, and, the, reverse, generated, the, recovery, mr, irwin, also, attempts, to, debunk, the, idea, that, protectionism, made, america, a, great, industrial, power, a, notion, believed, by, some, to, offer, lessons, for, developing, countries, today, as, its, share, of, global, manufacturing, powered, from, 23, in, 1870, to, 36, in, 1913, the, admittedly, high, tariffs, of, the, time, came, with, a, cost, estimated, at, around, 0, 5, of, gdp, in, the, mid, 1870s, in, some, industries, they, might, have, sped, up, development, by, a, few, years, but, american, growth, during, its, protectionist, period, was, more, to, do, with, its, abundant, resources, and, openness, to, people, and, ideas, according, to, irwin, tariffs, have, served, three, primary, purposes, in, the, united, states, to, raise, revenue, for, the, government, to, restrict, imports, and, protect, domestic, producers, from, foreign, competition, and, to, reach, reciprocity, agreements, that, reduce, trade, barriers, from, 1790, to, 1860, average, tariffs, increased, from, 20, percent, to, 60, percent, before, declining, again, to, 20, percent, from, 1861, to, 1933, which, irwin, characterizes, as, the, restriction, period, the, average, tariffs, increased, to, 50, percent, and, remained, at, that, level, for, several, decades, from, 1934, onwards, which, irwin, characterizes, as, the, reciprocity, period, the, average, tariff, declined, substantially, until, it, leveled, off, at, 5, percent, economist, paul, bairoch, documented, that, the, united, states, imposed, among, the, highest, rates, in, the, world, from, around, the, founding, of, the, country, until, the, world, war, ii, period, describing, the, united, states, as, the, mother, country, and, bastion, of, modern, protectionism, since, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, and, until, the, post, world, war, ii, period, alexander, hamilton, the, first, united, states, secretary, of, the, treasury, was, of, the, view, as, articulated, most, famously, in, his, report, on, manufactures, that, developing, an, industrialized, economy, was, impossible, without, protectionism, because, import, duties, are, necessary, to, shelter, domestic, infant, industries, until, they, could, achieve, economies, of, scale, the, industrial, takeoff, of, the, united, states, occurred, under, protectionist, policies, 1816, 1848, and, under, moderate, protectionism, 1846, 1861, and, continued, under, strict, protectionist, policies, 1861, 1945, in, the, late, 19th, century, higher, tariffs, were, introduced, on, the, grounds, that, they, were, needed, to, protect, american, wages, and, to, protect, american, farmers, between, 1824, and, the, 1940s, the, u, s, imposed, much, higher, average, tariff, rates, on, manufactured, products, than, did, britain, or, any, other, european, country, with, the, exception, for, a, period, of, time, of, spain, and, russia, up, until, the, end, of, world, war, ii, the, united, states, had, the, most, protectionist, economy, on, earth, the, bush, administration, implemented, tariffs, on, chinese, steel, in, 2002, according, to, a, 2005, review, of, existing, research, on, the, tariff, all, studies, found, that, the, tariffs, caused, more, harm, than, gains, to, the, us, economy, and, employment, the, obama, administration, implemented, tariffs, on, chinese, tires, between, 2009, and, 2012, as, an, anti, dumping, measure, a, 2016, study, found, that, these, tariffs, had, no, impact, on, employment, and, wages, in, the, us, tire, industry, in, 2018, eu, trade, commissioner, cecilia, malmstr, m, stated, that, the, us, was, playing, a, dangerous, game, in, applying, tariffs, on, steel, and, aluminum, imports, from, most, countries, and, stated, that, she, saw, the, trump, administration, s, decision, to, do, so, as, both, pure, protectionist, and, illegal, the, tariffs, imposed, by, the, trump, administration, during, the, china, united, states, trade, war, led, to, a, reduction, in, the, united, states, trade, deficit, with, china, great, britain, and, england, in, particular, became, one, of, the, most, prosperous, economic, regions, in, the, world, between, the, late, 1600s, and, early, 1800s, as, a, result, of, being, the, birthplace, of, the, industrial, revolution, that, began, in, the, mid, eighteenth, century, the, government, protected, its, merchants, and, kept, others, out, by, trade, barriers, regulations, and, subsidies, to, domestic, industries, in, order, to, maximize, exports, from, and, minimize, imports, to, the, realm, the, navigation, acts, of, the, late, 17th, century, required, all, trade, to, be, carried, in, english, ships, manned, by, english, crews, this, later, encompassed, all, britons, after, the, acts, of, union, 1707, united, scotland, with, england, colonists, were, required, to, send, their, produce, and, raw, materials, first, of, all, to, britain, where, the, surplus, was, then, sold, on, by, british, merchants, to, other, colonies, in, the, british, empire, or, bullion, earning, external, markets, the, colonies, were, forbidden, to, trade, directly, with, other, nations, or, rival, empires, the, goal, was, to, maintain, the, north, american, and, caribbean, colonies, as, dependent, agricultural, economies, geared, towards, producing, raw, materials, for, export, to, britain, the, growth, of, native, industry, was, discouraged, in, order, to, keep, the, colonies, dependent, on, the, united, kingdom, for, their, finished, goods, from, 1815, to, 1870, the, united, kingdom, reaped, the, benefits, of, being, the, world, s, first, modern, industrialised, nation, it, described, itself, as, the, workshop, of, the, world, meaning, that, its, finished, goods, were, produced, so, efficiently, and, cheaply, that, they, could, often, undersell, comparable, locally, manufactured, goods, in, almost, any, other, market, by, the, 1840s, the, united, kingdom, had, adopted, a, free, trade, policy, meaning, open, markets, and, no, tariffs, throughout, the, empire, the, corn, laws, were, tariffs, and, other, trade, restrictions, on, imported, food, and, corn, enforced, in, the, united, kingdom, between, 1815, and, 1846, and, enhanced, the, profits, and, political, power, associated, with, land, ownership, the, laws, raised, food, prices, and, the, costs, of, living, for, the, british, public, and, hampered, the, growth, of, other, british, economic, sectors, such, as, manufacturing, by, reducing, the, disposable, income, of, the, british, public, the, prime, minister, sir, robert, peel, a, conservative, achieved, repeal, in, 1846, with, the, support, of, the, whigs, in, parliament, overcoming, the, opposition, of, most, of, his, own, party, the, possessions, of, the, east, india, company, in, india, known, as, british, india, was, the, centrepiece, of, the, british, empire, and, because, of, an, efficient, taxation, system, it, paid, its, own, administrative, expenses, as, well, as, the, cost, of, the, large, british, indian, army, in, terms, of, trade, india, turned, only, a, small, profit, for, british, business, however, transfers, to, the, british, government, was, massive, in, 1801, unrequited, unpaid, or, paid, from, indian, collected, revenue, was, about, 30, of, british, domestic, savings, available, for, capital, formation, in, the, united, kingdom, europe, became, increasingly, protectionist, during, the, eighteenth, century, economic, historians, findlay, and, o, rourke, write, that, in, the, immediate, aftermath, of, the, napoleonic, wars, european, trade, policies, were, almost, universally, protectionist, with, the, exceptions, being, smaller, countries, such, as, the, netherlands, and, denmark, europe, increasingly, liberalized, its, trade, during, the, 19th, century, countries, such, as, the, netherlands, denmark, portugal, and, switzerland, and, arguably, sweden, and, belgium, had, fully, moved, towards, free, trade, prior, to, 1860, economic, historians, see, the, repeal, of, the, corn, laws, in, 1846, as, the, decisive, shift, toward, free, trade, in, britain, a, 1990, study, by, the, harvard, economic, historian, jeffrey, williamson, showed, that, the, corn, laws, which, imposed, restrictions, and, tariffs, on, imported, grain, substantially, increased, the, cost, of, living, for, british, workers, and, hampered, the, british, manufacturing, sector, by, reducing, the, disposable, incomes, that, british, workers, could, have, spent, on, manufactured, goods, the, shift, towards, liberalization, in, britain, occurred, in, part, due, to, the, influence, of, economists, like, david, ricardo, but, also, due, to, the, growing, power, of, urban, interests, findlay, and, o, rourke, characterize, 1860, cobden, chevalier, treaty, between, france, and, the, united, kingdom, as, a, decisive, shift, toward, european, free, trade, this, treaty, was, followed, by, numerous, free, trade, agreements, france, and, belgium, signed, a, treaty, in, 1861, a, franco, prussian,

however, it, previously, had, liberal, free, trade, policies, during, the, 18th, to, early, 19th, centuries, which, british, prime, minister, benjamin, disraeli, cited, as, an, instance, of, the, injury, done, by, unrestrained, competition, in, the, 1846, corn, laws, debate, arguing, that, it, destroyed, what, had, been, some, of, the, finest, manufacturers, of, the, world, in, 1812, the, countries, of, western, europe, began, to, steadily, liberalize, their, economies, after, world, war, ii, and, the, protectionism, of, the, interwar, period, but, john, tsang, then, hong, kong, s, secretary, for, commerce, industry, and, technology, and, chair, of, the, sixth, ministerial, conference, of, the, world, trade, organization, mc6, commented, in, 2005, that, the, eu, spent, around, 70, billion, per, year, on, trade, distorting, support, since, 1971, canada, has, protected, producers, of, eggs, milk, cheese, chicken, and, turkey, with, a, system, of, supply, management, though, prices, for, these, foods, in, canada, exceed, global, prices, the, farmers, and, processors, have, had, the, security, of, a, stable, market, to, finance, their, operations, doubts, about, the, safety, of, bovine, growth, hormone, sometimes, used, to, boost, dairy, production, led, to, hearings, before, the, senate, of, canada, resulting, in, a, ban, in, canada, thus, supply, management, of,

and, spanish, puerto, rico, following, the, achievement, of, their, independence, most, of, the, latin, american, countries, adopted, protectionism, they, both, feared, that, any, foreign, competition, would, stomp, out, their, newly, created, state, and, believed, that, lack, of, outside, resources, would, drive, domestic, production, the, protectionist, behavior, continued, up, until, and, during, the, world, wars, during, world, war, 2, latin, america, had, on, average, the, highest, tariffs, in, the, world, juan, per, n, erected, a, system, of, almost, complete, protectionism, against, imports, largely, cutting, off, argentina, from, the, international, market, in, the, 1940s, protectionism, created, a, domestically, oriented, industry, with, high, production, costs, incapable, of, competing, in, international, markets, at, the, same, time, output, of, beef, and, grain, the, country, s, main, export, goods, stagnated, the, iapi, began, shortchanging, growers, and, when, world, grain, prices, dropped, in, the, late, 1940s, it, stifled, agricultural, production, exports, and, business, sentiment, in, general, despite, these, shortcomings, protectionism, and, government, credits, did, allow, an, exponential, growth, of, the, internal, market, radio, sales, increased, 600, and, fridge, sales, grew, 218, among, others, during, this, period, argentina, s, economy, continued, to, grow, on, average, but, more, slowly, than, the, world, as, a, whole, or, than, its, neighbors, brazil, and, chile, by, 1950, argentina, s, gdp, per, capita, accounted, fell, to, less, than, half, of, that, of, the, united, states, there, is, a, broad, consensus, among, economists, that, protectionism, has, a, negative, effect, on, economic, growth, and, economic, welfare, while, free, trade, and, the, reduction, of, trade, barriers, has, a, positive, effect, on, economic, growth, however, protectionism, can, be, used, to, raise, government, revenue, and, enable, access, to, intellectual, property, including, essential, medicines, protectionism, is, frequently, criticized, by, economists, as, harming, the, people, it, is, intended, to, help, mainstream, economists, instead, support, free, trade, the, principle, of, comparative, advantage, shows, that, the, gains, from, free, trade, outweigh, any, losses, as, free, trade, creates, more, jobs, than, it, destroys, because, it, allows, countries, to, specialize, in, the, production, of, goods, and, services, in, which, they, have, a, comparative, advantage, protectionism, results, in, deadweight, loss, this, loss, to, overall, welfare, gives, no, one, any, benefit, unlike, in, a, free, market, where, there, is, no, such, total, loss, economist, stephen, p, magee, claims, the, benefits, of, free, trade, outweigh, the, losses, by, as, much, as, 100, to, 1, protectionism, has, been, accused, of, being, one, of, the, major, causes, of, war, proponents, of, this, theory, point, to, the, constant, warfare, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, among, european, countries, whose, governments, were, predominantly, mercantilist, and, protectionist, the, american, revolution, which, came, about, ostensibly, due, to, british, tariffs, and, taxes, according, to, a, slogan, of, fr, d, ric, bastiat, 1801, 1850, when, goods, cannot, cross, borders, armies, will, on, the, other, hand, archaeologist, lawrence, h, keeley, argues, in, his, book, war, before, civilization, that, disputes, between, trading, partners, escalate, to, war, more, frequently, than, disputes, between, nations, that, don, t, trade, much, with, each, other, the, opium, wars, were, fought, between, the, uk, and, china, over, the, right, of, british, merchants, to, engage, in, the, free, trade, of, opium, for, many, opium, users, what, started, as, recreation, soon, became, a, punishing, addiction, many, people, who, stopped, ingesting, opium, suffered, chills, nausea, and, cramps, and, sometimes, died, from, withdrawal, once, addicted, people, would, often, do, almost, anything, to, continue, to, get, access, to, the, drug, barbara, tuchman, says, both, european, intellectuals, and, leaders, overestimated, the, power, of, free, trade, on, the, eve, of, world, war, i, they, believed, that, the, interconnectedness, of, european, nations, through, trade, would, stop, a, continent, wide, war, from, breaking, out, as, the, economic, consequences, would, be, too, great, however, the, assumption, proved, incorrect, for, example, tuchman, noted, that, helmuth, von, moltke, the, younger, when, warned, of, such, consequences, refused, to, even, consider, them, in, his, plans, arguing, he, was, a, soldier, not, an, economist, the, ongoing, russo, ukraine, war, began, in, the, aftermath, of, the, revolution, of, dignity, and, the, signing, of, the, european, union, ukraine, association, agreement, in, 2014, which, included, a, deep, and, comprehensive, free, trade, area, for, ukraine, and, the, european, union, eu, the, agreement, on, trade, related, aspects, of, intellectual, property, rights, trips, is, an, international, legal, agreement, between, all, the, member, nations, of,

nationals, of, other, wto, member, nations, trips, was, negotiated, at, the, end, of, the, uruguay, round, of, the, general, agreement, on, tariffs, and, trade, gatt, between, 1989, and, 1990, and, is, administered, by, the, wto, statements, by, the, world, bank, indicate, that, trips, has, not, led, to, a, demonstrable, acceleration, of, investment, to, low, income, countries, though, it, may, have, done, so, for, middle, income, countries, critics, argue, that, trips, limits, the, ability, of, governments, to, introduce, competition, for, generic, producers, the, trips, agreement, allows, the, grant, of, compulsory, licenses, at, a, nation, s, discretion, trips, plus, conditions, in, the, united, states, ftas, with, australia, jordan, singapore, and, vietnam, have, restricted, the, application, of, compulsory, licenses, to, emergency, situations, antitrust, remedies, and, cases, of, public, non, commercial, use, one, of, the, most, visible, conflicts, over, trips, has, been, aids, drugs, in, africa, despite, the, role, that, patents, have, played, in, maintaining, higher, drug, costs, for, public, health, programs, across, africa, this, controversy, has, not, led, to, a, revision, of, trips, instead, an, interpretive, statement, the, doha, declaration, was, issued, in, november, 2001, which, indicated, that, trips, should, not, prevent, states, from, dealing, with, public, health, crises, and, allowed, for, compulsory, licenses, after, doha, phrma, the, united, states, and, to, a, lesser, extent, other, developed, nations, began, working, to, minimize, the, effect, of, the, declaration, in, 2020, conflicts, re, emerged, over, patents, copyrights, and, trade, secrets, related, to, covid, 19, vaccines, diagnostics, and, treatments, south, africa, and, india, proposed, that, wto, grant, a, temporary, waiver, to, enable, more, widespread, production, of, the, vaccines, since, suppressing, the, virus, as, quickly, as, possible, benefits, the, entire, world, the, waivers, would, be, in, addition, to, the, existing, but, cumbersome, flexibilities, in, trips, allowing, countries, to, impose, compulsory, licenses, over, 100, developing, nations, supported, the, waiver, but, it, was, blocked, by, the, g7, members, this, blocking, was, condemned, by, 400, organizations, including, doctors, without, borders, and, 115, members, of, the, european, parliament, in, june, 2022, after, extensive, involvement, of, the, european, union, the, wto, instead, adopted, a, watered, down, agreement, that, focuses, only, on, vaccine, patents, excludes, high, income, countries, and, china, and, contains, few, provisions, that, are, not, covered, by, existing, flexibilities, proponents, of, protectionism, argue, that, tariffs, raise, government, revenue, via, customs, developing, countries, including, least, developed, countries, ldcs, often, do, not, collect, income, taxes, because, personal, incomes, are, often, too, low, to, tax, and, they, lack, the, capability, to, collect, such, taxes, from, individuals, tariffs, were, the, greatest, source, of, united, states, federal, revenue, up, to, 95, at, times, until, the, federal, income, tax, began, after, 1913, for, well, over, a, century, the, federal, government, was, largely, financed, by, tariffs, averaging, about, 20, on, foreign, imports, at, the, end, of, the, american, civil, war, in, 1865, about, 63, of, federal, income, was, generated, by, the, excise, taxes, which, exceeded, the, 25, 4, generated, by, tariffs, in, 1915, during, world, war, i, tariffs, generated, only, 30, 1, of, revenues, since, 1935, tariff, income, has, continued, to, be, a, declining, percentage, of, federal, tax, income, a, 2016, study, found, that, trade, typically, favors, the, poor, as, they, spend, a, greater, share, of, their, earnings, on, goods, as, free, trade, reduces, the, costs, of, goods, other, research, found, that, china, s, entry, to, the, wto, benefited, us, consumers, as, the, price, of, chinese, goods, were, substantially, reduced, harvard, economist, dani, rodrik, argues, that, while, globalization, and, free, trade, does, contribute, to, social, problems, a, serious, retreat, into, protectionism, would, hurt, the, many, groups, that, benefit, from, trade, and, would, result, in, the, same, kind, of, social, conflicts, that, globalization, itself, generates, we, have, to, recognize, that, erecting, trade, barriers, will, help, in, only, a, limited, set, of, circumstances, and, that, trade, policy, will, rarely, be, the, best, response, to, the, problems, according, to, economic, historians, findlay, and, o, rourke, there, is, a, consensus, in, the, economics, literature, that, protectionist, policies, in, the, interwar, period, hurt, the, world, economy, overall, although, there, is, a, debate, about, whether, the, effect, was, large, or, small, economic, historian, paul, bairoch, argued, that, economic, protection, was, positively, correlated, with, economic, and, industrial, growth, during, the, 19th, century, for, example, gnp, growth, during, europe, s, liberal, period, in, the, middle, of, the, century, where, tariffs, were, at, their, lowest, averaged, 1, 7, per, year, while, industrial, growth, averaged, 1, 8, per, year, however, during, the, protectionist, era, of, the, 1870s, and, 1890s, gnp, growth, averaged, 2, 6, per, year, while, industrial, output, grew, at, 3, 8, per, year, roughly, twice, as, fast, as, it, had, during, the, liberal, era, of, low, tariffs, and, free, trade, one, study, found, that, tariffs, imposed, on, manufactured, goods, increase, economic, growth, in, developing, countries, and, this, growth, impact, remains, even, after, the, tariffs, are, repealed, according, to, dartmouth, economist, douglas, irwin, that, there, is, a, correlation, between, high, tariffs, and, growth, in, the, late, nineteenth, century, cannot, be, denied, but, correlation, is, not, causation, there, is, no, reason, for, necessarily, thinking, that, import, protection, was, a, good, policy, just, because, the, economic, outcome, was, good, the, outcome, could, have, been, driven, by, factors, completely, unrelated, to, the, tariff, or, perhaps, could, have, been, even, better, in, the, absence, of, protection, irwin, furthermore, writes, that, few, observers, have, argued, outright, that, the, high, tariffs, caused, such, growth, according, to, oxford, economic, historian, kevin, o, rourke, it, seems, clear, that, protection, was, important, for, the, growth, of, us, manufacturing, in, the, first, half, of, the, 19th, century, but, this, does, not, necessarily, imply, that, the, tariff, was, beneficial, for, gdp, growth, protectionists, have, often, pointed, to, german, and, american, industrialization, during, this, period, as, evidence, in, favor, of, their, position, but, economic, growth, is, influenced, by, many, factors, other, than, trade, policy, and, it, is, important, to, control, for, these, when, assessing, the, links, between, tariffs, and, growth, a, prominent, 1999, study, by, jeffrey, a, frankel, and, david, h, romer, found, contrary, to, free, trade, skeptics, claims, while, controlling, for, relevant, factors, that, trade, does, indeed, have, a, positive, impact, on, growth, and, incomes, economist, arvind, panagariya, criticizes, the, view, that, protectionism, is, good, for, growth, such, arguments, according, to, him, arise, from, revisionist, interpretation, of, east, asian, tigers, economic, history, the, asian, tigers, achieved, a, rapid, increase, in, per, capita, income, without, any, redistributive, social, programs, through, free, trade, which, advanced, western, economies, took, a, century, to, achieve, there, is, broad, consensus, among, economists, that, free, trade, helps, workers, in, developing, countries, even, though, they, are, not, subject, to, the, stringent, health, and, labor, standards, of, developed, countries, this, is, because, the, growth, of, manufacturing, and, of, the, myriad, other, jobs, that, the, new, export, sector, creates, has, a, ripple, effect, throughout, the, economy, that, creates, competition, among, producers, lifting, wages, and, living, conditions, the, nobel, laureates, milton, friedman, and, paul, krugman, have, argued, for, free, trade, as, a, model, for, economic, development, alan, greenspan, former, chair, of, the, american, federal, reserve, has, criticized, protectionist, proposals, as, leading, to, an, atrophy, of, our, competitive, ability, if, the, protectionist, route, is, followed, newer, more, efficient, industries, will, have, less, scope, to, expand, and, overall, output, and, economic, welfare, will, suffer, protectionists, postulate, that, new, industries, may, require, protection, from, entrenched, foreign, competition, in, order, to, develop, mainstream, economists, do, concede, that, tariffs, can, in, the, short, term, help, domestic, industries, to, develop, but, are, contingent, on, the, short, term, nature, of, the, protective, tariffs, and, the, ability, of, the, government, to, pick, the, winners, the, problems, are, that, protective, tariffs, will, not, be, reduced, after, the, infant, industry, reaches, a, foothold, and, that, governments, will, not, pick, industries, that, are, likely, to, succeed, economists, have, identified, a, number, of, cases, across, different, countries, and, industries, where, attempts, to, shelter, infant, industries, failed, the, united, states, which, today, has, the, largest, economy, in, the, world, and, one, of, the, highest, gdp, per, capita, has, employed, tariffs, throughout, much, of, its, history, alexander, hamilton, the, first, united, states, secretary, of, the, treasury, supported, tariffs, at, the, country, s, inception, in, his, 1791, report, on, manufactures, abraham, lincoln, signed, the, 1861, morrill, tariff, to, raise, revenue, during, the, united, states, civil, war, the, republican, party, united, states, a, fiscally, conservative, political, party, currently, supports, and, has, historically, supported, protectionism, certain, policies, of, first, world, governments, have, been, criticized, as, protectionist, such, as, the, common, agricultural, policy, in, the, european, union, longstanding, agricultural, subsidies, and, proposed, buy, american, provisions, in, economic, recovery, packages, in, the, united, states, heads, of, the, g20, meeting, in, london, on, 2, april, 2009, pledged, we, will, not, repeat, the, historic, mistakes, of, protectionism, of, previous, eras, adherence, to, this, pledge, is, monitored, by, the, global, trade, alert, providing, up, to, date, information, and, informed, commentary, to, help, ensure, that, the, g20, pledge, is, met, by, maintaining, confidence, in, the, world, trading, system, deterring, beggar, thy, neighbor, acts, and, preserving, the, contribution, that, exports, could, play, in, the, future, recovery, of, the, world, economy, although, they, were, reiterating, what, they, had, already, committed, to, in, the, 2008, washington, g20, summit, 17, of, these, 20, countries, were, reported, by, the, world, bank, as, having, imposed, trade, restrictive, measures, since, then, in, its, report, the, world, bank, says, most, of, the, world, s, major, economies, are, resorting, to, protectionist, measures, as, the, global, economic, slowdown, begins, to, bite, economists, who, have, examined, the, impact, of, new, trade, restrictive, measures, using, detailed, bilaterally, monthly, trade, statistics, estimated, that, new, measures, taken, through, late, 2009, were, distorting, global, merchandise, trade, by, 0, 25, to, 0, 5, about, 50, billion, a, year, since, then, however, president, donald, trump, announced, in, january, 2017, the, u, s, was, abandoning, the, tpp, trans, pacific, partnership, deal, saying, we, re, going, to, stop, the, ridiculous, trade, deals, that, have, taken, everybody, out, of, our, country, and, taken, companies, out, of, our, country, and, it, s, going, to, be, reversed, president, joe, biden, has, largely, continued, trump, s, protectionist, policies, and, has, not, negotiated, any, new, free, trade, agreements, since, assuming, office, in, january, 2021, the, 2010s, and, early, 2020s, have, seen, an, increased, use, of, protectionist, economic, policies, across, both, developed, countries, and, developing, countries, worldwide
