sichuanese, also, called, sichuanese, mandarin, is, a, branch, of, southwestern, mandarin, spoken, mainly, in, sichuan, and, chongqing, which, was, part, of, sichuan, province, until, 1997, and, the, adjacent, regions, of, their, neighboring, provinces, such, as, hubei, guizhou, yunnan, hunan, and, shaanxi, although, sichuanese, is, often, synonymous, with, the, chengdu, chongqing, dialect, there, is, still, a, great, amount, of, diversity, among, the, sichuanese, dialects, some, of, which, are, mutually, unintelligible, with, each, other, in, addition, because, sichuanese, is, the, lingua, franca, in, sichuan, chongqing, and, part, of, tibet, it, is, also, used, by, many, tibetan, yi, qiang, and, other, ethnic, minority, groups, as, a, second, language, sichuanese, is, more, similar, to, standard, chinese, than, southeastern, chinese, varieties, but, is, still, quite, divergent, in, phonology, vocabulary, and, even, grammar, the, minjiang, dialect, is, especially, difficult, for, speakers, of, other, mandarin, dialects, to, understand, sichuanese, can, be, further, divided, into, a, number, of, dialects, chengdu, chongqing, minjiang, renshou, fushun, and, ya, an, shimian, the, dialect, of, chengdu, the, capital, of, sichuan, province, and, an, important, central, city, is, the, most, representative, dialect, of, southwestern, mandarin, and, is, used, widely, in, sichuan, opera, and, other, art, forms, of, the, region, modern, sichuanese, evolved, due, to, a, great, wave, of, immigration, during, the, ming, dynasty, 1368, 1644, many, immigrants, mainly, from, hunan, hubei, jiangxi, and, guangdong, flooded, into, sichuan, bringing, their, languages, with, them, the, influence, of, sichuanese, has, resulted, in, a, distinct, form, of, standard, chinese, that, is, often, confused, with, real, sichuanese, sichuanese, spoken, by, about, 120, million, people, would, rank, tenth, among, languages, by, number, of, speakers, just, behind, japanese, if, counted, as, a, separate, language, sichuanese, is, mainly, spoken, in, and, around, the, sichuan, basin, which, includes, almost, all, of, sichuan, province, and, chongqing, municipality, except, for, some, tibetan, and, yi, inhabited, areas, it, is, also, spoken, in, the, border, regions, of, sichuan, s, neighboring, provinces, northern, yunnan, and, guizhou, southern, shaanxi, and, western, hubei, however, it, is, possible, to, divide, sichuanese, into, four, sub, dialects, according, to, the, preservation, or, distribution, of, the, middle, chinese, checked, tone, the, minjiang, dialect, which, preserves, the, checked, tone, the, chengdu, chongqing, dialect, in, which, the, checked, tone, has, merged, into, the, light, level, tone, the, renshou, fushun, dialect, which, merges, the, checked, tone, into, the, departing, tone, and, the, ya, an, shimian, dialect, in, which, the, checked, tone, is, merged, into, the, dark, level, tone, the, minjiang, ya, an, shimian, and, renshou, fushun, dialects, are, spoken, mainly, in, south, and, west, sichuan, regions, in, which, the, inhabitants, have, significantly, more, indigenous, sichuanese, descent, than, those, of, north, and, east, sichuan, thus, these, dialects, are, often, referred, as, old, sichuanese, as, the, preserve, many, characteristics, of, bashu, the, extinct, language, formerly, spoken, by, the, first, sichuanese, han, chinese, people, the, chengdu, chongqing, dialect, named, after, the, two, largest, cities, in, greater, sichuan, are, spoken, in, a, contiguous, area, mainly, in, north, and, east, sichuan, it, is, often, referred, as, new, sichuanese, because, it, exhibits, fewer, characteristics, of, the, bashu, language, like, many, of, the, southern, provinces, in, china, sichuan, was, fully, sinicized, by, the, end, of, the, tang, dynasty, the, modern, variety, of, chinese, spoken, in, the, region, formed, relatively, recently, in, the, thirteenth, century, the, population, of, sichuan, dropped, precipitously, suspected, to, be, due, in, part, to, a, series, of, plagues, and, mongol, invasions, the, population, did, not, recover, until, it, was, replenished, by, subsequent, migrations, from, hubei, as, well, as, xiang, gan, and, hakka, speakers, in, the, following, centuries, these, varieties, largely, supplanted, the, earlier, varieties, of, chinese, in, sichuan, known, as, ba, shu, chinese, or, old, sichuanese, like, min, chinese, ba, shu, chinese, was, different, from, the, middle, chinese, of, the, sui, tang, and, song, dynasties, but, instead, a, divergent, dialect, group, independently, descended, from, the, old, chinese, of, the, han, dynasty, which, formed, a, substratum, that, influenced, the, formation, of, the, modern, dialect, group, and, helps, to, explain, the, distinctiveness, of, modern, sichuanese, within, the, mandarin, dialect, continuum, there, are, five, phonemic, tones, in, sichuanese, dark, level, tone, light, level, tone, rising, tone, departing, tone, and, entering, tone, or, checked, tone, in, some, regions, the, checked, tone, of, sichuanese, has, been, merged, into, another, tone, which, is, very, different, from, standard, mandarin, whose, checked, tone, has, been, merged, irregularly, into, the, other, four, tones, according, to, phonology, of, sichuan, dialect, among, all, the, 150, sichuanese, speaking, cities, and, counties, 48, keep, the, checked, tone, while, the, other, 102, have, only, four, tones, particularly, in, some, sub, dialects, of, the, minjiang, dialect, such, as, the, yingjing, dialect, the, departing, tone, has, developed, into, two, different, tones, a, colloquial, tone, which, is, similar, to, the, second, tone, as, a, characteristic, of, ba, shu, and, a, literary, tone, which, is, the, same, as, the, chengdu, dialect, the, tone, contours, of, the, sichuanese, dialects, are, highly, and, quite, different, from, those, of, beijing, mandarin, in, sichuanese, the, first, tone, dark, level, tone, is, a, high, level, tone, like, beijing, the, second, tone, light, level, tone, is, a, low, falling, tone, the, mirror, image, of, beijing, the, third, tone, rising, tone, is, a, high, falling, tone, and, the, fourth, tone, departing, tone, is, a, low, or, mid, rising, tone, interchanged, compared, to, beijing, and, the, fifth, tone, entering, tone, is, mid, or, high, if, it, s, not, merged, as, shown, in, the, chart, below, in, the, areas, which, keep, the, entering, tone, the, five, tones, of, sichuanese, are, nearly, identical, to, the, values, of, 5, of, the, 6, tones, of, the, indigenous, southern, qiang, language, initials, or, syllable, onsets, are, initial, consonants, of, possible, syllables, there, are, 21, initials, in, the, chengdu, dialect, of, sichuanese, academically, referred, as, standard, sichuanese, four, sichuanese, initial, consonants, do, not, exist, in, beijing, and, on, the, other, hand, five, initials, in, beijing, do, not, exist, in, sichuanese, and, the, following, is, the, initial, consonant, inventory, of, sichuanese, transcribed, in, the, international, phonetic, alphabet, and, under, every, ipa, symbol, in, the, inventory, below, there, is, the, transcription, of, that, sound, in, sichuanese, pinyin, and, a, chinese, character, using, that, initial, a, final, the, remainder, of, syllable, after, the, initial, consists, of, an, optional, medial, glide, a, vowel, and, an, optional, final, consonants, there, are, 36, finals, in, the, chengdu, dialect, of, sichuanese, four, sichuanese, finals, do, not, exist, in, beijing, and, on, the, other, hand, three, beijing, finals, do, not, exist, in, sichuanese, and, the, following, is, the, inventory, of, sichuanese, finals, transcribed, in, the, international, phonetic, alphabet, and, under, every, ipa, symbol, in, the, inventory, below, there, is, the, standard, orthography, of, that, sound, in, sichuanese, pinyin, and, a, chinese, character, using, that, final, there, is, a, discrepancy, between, old, sichuanese, and, new, sichuanese, in, terms, of, finals, in, the, old, minjiang, dialect, the, stop, consonants, for, checked, tone, syllables, in, middle, chinese, have, developed, into, tense, vowels, to, create, a, phonemic, contrast, and, in, several, cities, and, counties, the, tense, vowels, are, followed, by, a, glottal, stop, to, emphasize, the, contrast, meanwhile, the, checked, tone, has, disappeared, in, other, sichuanese, dialects, the, following, table, shows, the, tense, vowels, of, minjiang, dialect, s, three, sub, dialects, spoken, in, luzhou, qionglai, and, leshan, and, a, comparison, with, other, sichuanese, dialects, is, also, presented, the, existence, of, literary, and, colloquial, readings, is, a, notable, feature, in, sichuanese, and, some, other, sinitic, varieties, such, as, cantonese, or, hokkien, in, sichuanese, colloquial, readings, tend, to, resemble, ba, shu, chinese, old, sichuanese, or, southern, old, mandarin, while, literary, readings, tend, to, resemble, modern, standard, mandarin, for, example, in, the, yaoling, dialect, the, colloquial, reading, of, means, things, is, which, is, very, similar, to, its, pronunciation, of, ba, shu, chinese, in, the, song, dynasty, 960, 1279, meanwhile, its, literary, reading, is, relatively, similar, to, the, standard, mandarin, pronunciation, the, table, below, shows, some, examples, of, chinese, characters, with, both, literary, and, colloquial, readings, in, sichuanese, only, 47, 8, of, sichuanese, vocabulary, is, in, common, with, the, beijing, dialect, on, which, standard, chinese, is, based, indeed, sichuanese, shares, more, vocabulary, with, the, xiang, and, gan, varieties, of, chinese, even, though, sichuanese, is, usually, classified, as, a, dialect, of, mandarin, the, vocabulary, of, sichuanese, has, three, main, origins, ba, shu, or, ancient, sichuanese, middle, chinese, and, the, languages, of, the, immigrants, including, proto, mandarin, from, hubei, xiang, gan, and, hakka, which, were, brought, to, sichuan, during, the, ming, and, qing, dynasties, recently, many, loanwords, have, been, introduced, to, sichuanese, from, standard, mandarin, and, english, meanwhile, new, sichuanese, words, are, developing, in, large, cities, such, as, chengdu, and, chongqing, which, then, spread, at, a, dramatic, speed, through, sichuan, xiong, 2, qi, 3, meaning, to, cheer, someone, on, is, a, typical, example, of, a, novel, sichuanese, word, equivalent, to, ji, y, u, in, standard, mandarin, p, r, duo, is, a, word, exclusive, to, sichuanese, which, means, henpecked, husbands, a, standard, mandarin, equivalent, of, is, q, gu, n, y, n, the, prototype, of, comes, from, a, kind, of, bicycle, with, ears, in, chengdu, which, was, first, invented, by, men, in, chengdu, in, order, to, make, their, wives, sit, more, comfortably, there, are, still, a, few, such, bikes, on, streets, of, chengdu, the, chengdu, dialect, is, usually, taken, as, a, representative, of, sichuanese, sichuanese, shares, the, most, similar, vocabulary, with, yunnanese, a, dialect, of, southwestern, mandarin, spoken, in, the, neighboring, province, however, the, relationship, between, sichuanese, and, northern, mandarin, dialects, including, the, standard, language, is, weaker, than, the, relationship, between, xiang, and, gan, in, terms, of, vocabulary, sichuanese, has, the, second, closest, relationship, with, xiang, the, two, varieties, share, a, large, number, of, exclusively, unique, words, this, is, mainly, because, many, xiang, speaking, immigrants, from, hunan, moved, to, sichuan, during, the, great, wave, of, immigration, during, the, ming, and, qing, dynasties, so, xiang, does, not, have, such, a, close, relationship, with, other, southwestern, varieties, of, chinese, such, as, those, spoken, in, yunnan, guangxi, or, hubei, for, example, in, both, sichuanese, and, xiang, the, verb, to, squat, is, gu, 1, but, d, n, in, standard, mandarin, the, noun, kitchen, is, zao, 4, vu, 2, but, ch, f, ng, in, standard, and, the, adjective, thick, is, ian, 4, but, n, ng, in, standard, furthermore, the, sichuanese, vocabulary, also, contains, words, from, old, xiang, and, middle, xiang, such, as, sloppy, old, and, son, though, sichuanese, is, not, as, endangered, as, some, other, languages, of, china, the, prevalence, of, sichuanese, has, dramatically, lessened, as, the, popularity, of, mandarin, chinese, has, risen, government, policy, limits, the, use, of, sichuanese, in, broadcasting, television, and, many, public, places, furthermore, the, use, of, sichuanese, as, a, teaching, medium, is, not, permitted, in, the, curriculum, which, has, resulted, in, a, reduction, of, fluency, among, young, people, in, sichuanese, speaking, areas, since, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, the, sichuanese, spoken, by, them, is, greatly, influenced, by, the, national, language, the, decline, of, sichuanese, threatens, to, severely, impact, ba, shu, culture, rooted, in, the, sichuanese, dialect, particularly, traditional, shu, arts, such, as, sichuan, opera, risking, severe, decline, or, even, extinction, china, enacted, laws, in, 2000, mandating, the, use, of, mandarin, provinces, including, sichuan, established, language, committees, to, advise, monitor, and, enforce, mandarin, usage, the, mandate, inevitably, caused, massive, decline, in, audience, members, and, the, performance, of, traditional, ba, shu, folk, art
