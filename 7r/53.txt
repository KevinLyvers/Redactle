marketing, firms, like, a, media, market, research, or, advertising, agency, sometimes, a, trade, association, or, government, agency, such, as, the, agricultural, marketing, service, advertises, on, behalf, of, an, entire, industry, or, locality, often, a, specific, type, of, food, e, g, got, milk, food, from, a, specific, area, or, a, city, or, region, as, a, tourism, destination, market, orientations, are, philosophies, concerning, the, factors, that, should, go, into, market, planning, the, marketing, mix, which, outlines, the, specifics, of, the, product, and, how, it, will, be, sold, including, the, channels, that, will, be, used, to, advertise, the, product, is, affected, by, the, environment, surrounding, the, product, the, results, of, marketing, research, and, market, research, and, the, characteristics, of, the, product, s, target, market, once, these, factors, are, determined, marketers, must, then, decide, what, methods, of, promoting, the, product, including, use, of, coupons, and, other, price, inducements, marketing, is, currently, defined, by, the, american, marketing, association, ama, as, the, activity, set, of, institutions, and, processes, for, creating, communicating, delivering, and, exchanging, offerings, that, have, value, for, customers, clients, partners, and, society, at, large, however, the, definition, of, marketing, has, evolved, over, the, years, the, ama, reviews, this, definition, and, its, definition, for, marketing, research, every, three, years, the, interests, of, society, at, large, were, added, into, the, definition, in, 2008, the, development, of, the, definition, may, be, seen, by, comparing, the, 2008, definition, with, the, ama, s, 1935, version, marketing, is, the, performance, of, business, activities, that, direct, the, flow, of, goods, and, services, from, producers, to, consumers, the, newer, definition, highlights, the, increased, prominence, of, other, stakeholders, in, the, new, conception, of, marketing, recent, definitions, of, marketing, place, more, emphasis, on, the, consumer, relationship, as, opposed, to, a, pure, exchange, process, for, instance, prolific, marketing, author, and, educator, philip, kotler, has, evolved, his, definition, of, marketing, in, 1980, he, defined, marketing, as, satisfying, needs, and, wants, through, an, exchange, process, and, in, 2018, defined, it, as, the, process, by, which, companies, engage, customers, build, strong, customer, relationships, and, create, customer, value, in, order, to, capture, value, from, customers, in, return, a, related, definition, from, the, sales, process, engineering, perspective, defines, marketing, as, a, set, of, processes, that, are, interconnected, and, interdependent, with, other, functions, of, a, business, aimed, at, achieving, customer, interest, and, satisfaction, some, definitions, of, marketing, highlight, marketing, s, ability, to, produce, value, to, shareholders, of, the, firm, as, well, in, this, context, marketing, can, be, defined, as, the, management, process, that, seeks, to, maximise, returns, to, shareholders, by, developing, relationships, with, valued, customers, and, creating, a, competitive, advantage, for, instance, the, chartered, institute, of, marketing, defines, marketing, from, a, customer, centric, perspective, focusing, on, the, management, process, responsible, for, identifying, anticipating, and, satisfying, customer, requirements, profitably, in, the, past, marketing, practice, tended, to, be, seen, as, a, creative, industry, which, included, advertising, distribution, and, selling, and, even, today, many, parts, of, the, marketing, process, e, g, product, design, art, director, brand, management, advertising, inbound, marketing, copywriting, etc, involve, the, use, of, the, creative, arts, however, because, marketing, makes, extensive, use, of, social, sciences, psychology, sociology, mathematics, economics, anthropology, and, neuroscience, the, profession, is, now, widely, recognized, as, a, science, marketing, science, has, developed, a, concrete, process, that, can, be, followed, to, create, a, marketing, plan, the, marketing, concept, proposes, that, to, complete, its, organizational, objectives, an, organization, should, anticipate, the, needs, and, wants, of, potential, consumers, and, satisfy, them, more, effectively, than, its, competitors, this, concept, originated, from, adam, smith, s, book, the, wealth, of, nations, but, would, not, become, widely, used, until, nearly, 200, years, later, marketing, and, marketing, concepts, are, directly, related, given, the, centrality, of, customer, needs, and, wants, in, marketing, a, rich, understanding, of, these, concepts, is, essential, marketing, research, conducted, for, the, purpose, of, new, product, development, or, product, improvement, is, often, concerned, with, identifying, the, consumer, s, unmet, needs, customer, needs, are, central, to, market, segmentation, which, is, concerned, with, dividing, markets, into, distinct, groups, of, buyers, on, the, basis, of, distinct, needs, characteristics, or, behaviors, who, might, require, separate, products, or, marketing, mixes, needs, based, segmentation, also, known, as, benefit, segmentation, places, the, customers, desires, at, the, forefront, of, how, a, company, designs, and, markets, products, or, services, although, needs, based, segmentation, is, difficult, to, do, in, practice, it, has, been, proved, to, be, one, of, the, most, effective, ways, to, segment, a, market, in, addition, a, great, deal, of, advertising, and, promotion, is, designed, to, show, how, a, given, product, s, benefits, meet, the, customer, s, needs, wants, or, expectations, in, a, unique, way, the, two, major, segments, of, marketing, are, business, to, business, b2b, marketing, and, business, to, consumer, b2c, marketing, b2b, business, to, business, marketing, refers, to, any, marketing, strategy, or, content, that, is, geared, towards, a, business, or, organization, any, company, that, sells, products, or, services, to, other, businesses, or, organizations, vs, consumers, typically, uses, b2b, marketing, strategies, the, 7, p, s, of, b2b, marketing, are, product, price, place, promotion, people, process, and, physical, evidence, some, of, the, trends, in, b2b, marketing, include, content, such, as, podcasts, videos, and, social, media, marketing, campaigns, examples, of, products, sold, through, b2b, marketing, include, the, four, major, categories, of, b2b, product, purchasers, are, business, to, consumer, marketing, or, b2c, marketing, refers, to, the, tactics, and, strategies, in, which, a, company, promotes, its, products, and, services, to, individual, people, traditionally, this, could, refer, to, individuals, shopping, for, personal, products, in, a, broad, sense, more, recently, the, term, b2c, refers, to, the, online, selling, of, consumer, products, consumer, to, business, marketing, or, c2b, marketing, is, a, business, model, where, the, end, consumers, create, products, and, services, which, are, consumed, by, businesses, and, organizations, it, is, diametrically, opposed, to, the, popular, concept, of, b2c, or, business, to, consumer, where, the, companies, make, goods, and, services, available, to, the, end, consumers, in, this, type, of, business, model, businesses, profit, from, consumers, willingness, to, name, their, own, price, or, contribute, data, or, marketing, to, the, company, while, consumers, benefit, from, flexibility, direct, payment, or, free, or, reduced, price, products, and, services, one, of, the, major, benefit, of, this, type, of, business, model, is, that, it, offers, a, company, a, competitive, advantage, in, the, market, customer, to, customer, marketing, or, c2c, marketing, represents, a, market, environment, where, one, customer, purchases, goods, from, another, customer, using, a, third, party, business, or, platform, to, facilitate, the, transaction, c2c, companies, are, a, new, type, of, model, that, has, emerged, with, e, commerce, technology, and, the, sharing, economy, the, different, goals, of, b2b, and, b2c, marketing, lead, to, differences, in, the, b2b, and, b2c, markets, the, main, differences, in, these, markets, are, demand, purchasing, volume, number, of, customers, customer, concentration, distribution, buying, nature, buying, influences, negotiations, reciprocity, leasing, and, promotional, methods, a, marketing, orientation, has, been, defined, as, a, philosophy, of, business, management, or, a, corporate, state, of, mind, or, as, an, organizational, culture, although, scholars, continue, to, debate, the, precise, nature, of, specific, concepts, that, inform, marketing, practice, the, most, commonly, cited, orientations, are, as, follows, a, marketing, mix, is, a, foundational, tool, used, to, guide, decision, making, in, marketing, the, marketing, mix, represents, the, basic, tools, that, marketers, can, use, to, bring, their, products, or, services, to, the, market, they, are, the, foundation, of, managerial, marketing, and, the, marketing, plan, typically, devotes, a, section, to, the, marketing, mix, the, 4ps, refers, to, four, broad, categories, of, marketing, decisions, namely, product, price, promotion, and, place, the, origins, of, the, 4, ps, can, be, traced, to, the, late, 1940s, the, first, known, mention, has, been, attributed, to, a, professor, of, marketing, at, harvard, university, james, culliton, the, 4, ps, in, its, modern, form, was, first, proposed, in, 1960, by, e, jerome, mccarthy, who, presented, them, within, a, managerial, approach, that, covered, analysis, consumer, behavior, market, research, market, segmentation, and, planning, phillip, kotler, popularised, this, approach, and, helped, spread, the, 4, ps, model, mccarthy, s, 4, ps, have, been, widely, adopted, by, both, marketing, academics, and, practitioners, one, of, the, limitations, of, the, 4ps, approach, is, its, emphasis, on, an, inside, out, view, an, inside, out, approach, is, the, traditional, planning, approach, where, the, organization, identifies, its, desired, goals, and, objectives, which, are, often, based, around, what, has, always, been, done, marketing, s, task, then, becomes, one, of, selling, the, organization, s, products, and, messages, to, the, outside, or, external, stakeholders, in, contrast, an, outside, in, approach, first, seeks, to, understand, the, needs, and, wants, of, the, consumer, from, a, model, building, perspective, the, 4, ps, has, attracted, a, number, of, criticisms, well, designed, models, should, exhibit, clearly, defined, categories, that, are, mutually, exclusive, with, no, overlap, yet, the, 4, ps, model, has, extensive, overlapping, problems, several, authors, stress, the, hybrid, nature, of, the, fourth, p, mentioning, the, presence, of, two, important, dimensions, communication, general, and, informative, communications, such, as, public, relations, and, corporate, communications, and, promotion, persuasive, communications, such, as, advertising, and, direct, selling, certain, marketing, activities, such, as, personal, selling, may, be, classified, as, either, promotion, or, as, part, of, the, place, i, e, distribution, element, some, pricing, tactics, such, as, promotional, pricing, can, be, classified, as, price, variables, or, promotional, variables, and, therefore, also, exhibit, some, overlap, other, important, criticisms, include, that, the, marketing, mix, lacks, a, strategic, framework, and, is, therefore, unfit, to, be, a, planning, instrument, particularly, when, uncontrollable, external, elements, are, an, important, aspect, of, the, marketing, environment, to, overcome, the, deficiencies, of, the, 4p, model, some, authors, have, suggested, extensions, or, modifications, to, the, original, model, extensions, of, the, four, p, s, are, often, included, in, cases, such, as, services, marketing, where, unique, characteristics, i, e, intangibility, perishability, heterogeneity, and, the, inseparability, of, production, and, consumption, warrant, additional, consideration, factors, other, extensions, include, people, process, and, physical, evidence, and, are, often, applied, in, the, case, of, services, marketing, other, extensions, have, been, found, necessary, in, retail, marketing, industrial, marketing, and, internet, marketing, in, response, to, environmental, and, technological, changes, in, marketing, as, well, as, criticisms, towards, the, 4ps, approach, the, 4cs, has, emerged, as, a, modern, marketing, mix, model, robert, f, lauterborn, proposed, a, 4, cs, classification, in, 1990, his, classification, is, a, more, consumer, orientated, version, of, the, 4, ps, that, attempts, to, better, fit, the, movement, from, mass, marketing, to, niche, marketing, consumer, or, client, the, consumer, refers, to, the, person, or, group, that, will, acquire, the, product, this, aspect, of, the, model, focuses, on, fulfilling, the, wants, or, needs, of, the, consumer, cost, cost, refers, to, what, is, exchanged, in, return, for, the, product, cost, mainly, consists, of, the, monetary, value, of, the, product, cost, also, refers, to, anything, else, the, consumer, must, sacrifice, to, attain, the, product, such, as, time, or, money, spent, on, transportation, to, acquire, the, product, convenience, like, place, in, the, 4ps, model, convenience, refers, to, where, the, product, will, be, sold, this, however, not, only, refers, to, physical, stores, but, also, whether, the, product, is, available, in, person, or, online, the, convenience, aspect, emphasizes, making, it, as, easy, as, possible, for, the, consumer, to, attain, the, product, thus, making, them, more, likely, to, do, so, communication, like, promotion, in, the, 4ps, model, communication, refers, to, how, consumers, find, out, about, a, product, unlike, promotion, communication, not, only, refers, to, the, one, way, communication, of, advertising, but, also, the, two, way, communication, available, through, social, media, the, term, marketing, environment, relates, to, all, of, the, factors, whether, internal, external, direct, or, indirect, that, affect, a, firm, s, marketing, decision, making, planning, a, firm, s, marketing, environment, consists, of, three, main, areas, which, are, marketing, research, is, a, systematic, process, of, analyzing, data, that, involves, conducting, research, to, support, marketing, activities, and, the, statistical, interpretation, of, data, into, information, this, information, is, then, used, by, managers, to, plan, marketing, activities, gauge, the, nature, of, a, firm, s, marketing, environment, and, to, attain, information, from, suppliers, a, distinction, should, be, made, between, marketing, research, and, market, research, market, research, involves, gathering, information, about, a, particular, target, market, as, an, example, a, firm, may, conduct, research, in, a, target, market, after, selecting, a, suitable, market, segment, in, contrast, marketing, research, relates, to, all, research, conducted, within, marketing, market, research, is, a, subset, of, marketing, research, avoiding, the, word, consumer, which, shows, up, in, both, market, research, is, about, distribution, while, marketing, research, encompasses, distribution, advertising, effectiveness, and, salesforce, effectiveness, the, stages, of, research, include, market, segmentation, consists, of, taking, the, total, heterogeneous, market, for, a, product, and, dividing, it, into, several, sub, markets, or, segments, each, of, which, tends, to, be, homogeneous, in, all, significant, aspects, the, process, is, conducted, for, two, main, purposes, better, allocation, of, a, firm, s, finite, resources, and, to, better, serve, the, more, diversified, tastes, of, contemporary, consumers, a, firm, only, possesses, a, certain, amount, of, resources, thus, it, must, make, choices, and, appreciate, the, related, costs, in, servicing, specific, groups, of, consumers, moreover, with, more, diversity, in, the, tastes, of, modern, consumers, firms, are, noting, the, benefit, of, servicing, a, multiplicity, of, new, markets, market, segmentation, can, be, defined, in, terms, of, the, stp, acronym, meaning, segmentation, targeting, and, positioning, segmentation, involves, the, initial, splitting, up, of, consumers, into, persons, of, like, needs, wants, tastes, commonly, used, criteria, include, once, a, segment, has, been, identified, to, target, a, firm, must, ascertain, whether, the, segment, is, beneficial, for, them, to, service, the, damp, acronym, is, used, as, criteria, to, gauge, the, viability, of, a, target, market, the, elements, of, damp, are, the, next, step, in, the, targeting, process, is, the, level, of, differentiation, involved, in, a, segment, serving, three, modes, of, differentiation, exist, which, are, commonly, applied, by, firms, these, are, positioning, concerns, how, to, position, a, product, in, the, minds, of, consumers, and, inform, what, attributes, differentiate, it, from, the, competitor, s, products, a, firm, often, performs, this, by, producing, a, perceptual, map, which, denotes, similar, products, produced, in, the, same, industry, according, to, how, consumers, perceive, their, price, and, quality, from, a, product, s, placing, on, the, map, a, firm, would, tailor, its, marketing, communications, to, meld, with, the, product, s, perception, among, consumers, and, its, position, among, competitors, offering, the, promotional, mix, outlines, how, a, company, will, market, its, product, it, consists, of, five, tools, personal, selling, sales, promotion, public, relations, advertising, and, social, media, the, area, of, marketing, planning, involves, forging, a, plan, for, a, firm, s, marketing, activities, a, marketing, plan, can, also, pertain, to, a, specific, product, as, well, as, to, an, organization, s, overall, marketing, strategy, an, organization, s, marketing, planning, process, is, derived, from, its, overall, business, strategy, thus, when, top, management, is, devising, the, firm, s, strategic, direction, mission, the, intended, marketing, activities, are, incorporated, into, this, plan, within, the, overall, strategic, marketing, plan, the, stages, of, the, process, are, listed, as, thus, as, stated, previously, the, senior, management, of, a, firm, would, formulate, a, general, business, strategy, for, a, firm, however, this, general, business, strategy, would, be, interpreted, and, implemented, in, different, contexts, throughout, the, firm, at, the, corporate, level, marketing, objectives, are, typically, broad, based, in, nature, and, pertain, to, the, general, vision, of, the, firm, in, the, short, medium, or, long, term, as, an, example, if, one, pictures, a, group, of, companies, or, a, conglomerate, top, management, may, state, that, sales, for, the, group, should, increase, by, 25, over, a, ten, year, period, a, strategic, business, unit, sbu, is, a, subsidiary, within, a, firm, which, participates, within, a, given, market, industry, the, sbu, would, embrace, the, corporate, strategy, and, attune, it, to, its, own, particular, industry, for, instance, an, sbu, may, partake, in, the, sports, goods, industry, it, thus, would, ascertain, how, it, would, attain, additional, sales, of, sports, goods, in, order, to, satisfy, the, overall, business, strategy, the, functional, level, relates, to, departments, within, the, sbus, such, as, marketing, finance, hr, production, etc, the, functional, level, would, adopt, the, sbu, s, strategy, and, determine, how, to, accomplish, the, sbu, s, own, objectives, in, its, market, to, use, the, example, of, the, sports, goods, industry, again, the, marketing, department, would, draw, up, marketing, plans, strategies, and, communications, to, help, the, sbu, achieve, its, marketing, aims, the, product, life, cycle, plc, is, a, tool, used, by, marketing, managers, to, gauge, the, progress, of, a, product, especially, relating, to, sales, or, revenue, accrued, over, time, the, plc, is, based, on, a, few, key, assumptions, including, in, the, introduction, stage, a, product, is, launched, onto, the, market, to, stimulate, the, growth, of, sales, revenue, use, of, advertising, may, be, high, in, order, to, heighten, awareness, of, the, product, in, question, during, the, growth, stage, the, product, s, sales, revenue, is, increasing, which, may, stimulate, more, marketing, communications, to, sustain, sales, more, entrants, enter, into, the, market, to, reap, the, apparent, high, profits, that, the, industry, is, producing, when, the, product, hits, maturity, its, starts, to, level, off, and, an, increasing, number, of, entrants, to, a, market, produce, price, falls, for, the, product, firms, may, use, sales, promotions, to, raise, sales, during, decline, demand, for, a, good, begins, to, taper, off, and, the, firm, may, opt, to, discontinue, the, manufacture, of, the, product, this, is, so, if, revenue, for, the, product, comes, from, efficiency, savings, in, production, over, actual, sales, of, a, good, service, however, if, a, product, services, a, niche, market, or, is, complementary, to, another, product, it, may, continue, the, manufacture, of, the, product, despite, a, low, level, of, sales, revenue, being, accrued
