the, rebels, this, occurred, as, several, human, right, violations, were, perpetrated, against, members, of, the, libyan, regime, it, was, later, realised, that, the, au, s, hesitation, was, due, to, its, lack, of, capacity, and, its, inability, to, engage, in, democratic, reform, the, au, attempted, to, mediate, in, the, early, stages, of, the, 2011, libyan, civil, war, forming, an, ad, hoc,

although, the, african, union, is, there, to, keep, peace, it, is, not, a, long, term, solution, the, goal, as, stated, by, the, au, is, to, establish, a, libyan, government, that, is, sustainable, to, ensuring, peace, in, libya, to, achieve, some, level, of, peace, in, libya, the, au, has, to, moderate, peace, talks, which, are, aimed, at, achieving, compromises, and, power, sharing, accommodations, as, well, the, african, union, has, the, power, to, militarily, intervene, on, behalf, of, its, member, states, as, laid, out, in, article, 4, h, of, the, constitutive, act, of, the,
