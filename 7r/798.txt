emergency, management, also, disaster, management, is, a, science, and, a, system, charged, with, creating, the, framework, within, which, communities, reduce, vulnerability, to, hazards, and, cope, with, disasters, emergency, management, despite, its, name, does, not, actually, focus, on, the, management, of, emergencies, emergency, management, or, disaster, management, can, be, understood, as, minor, events, with, limited, impacts, and, are, managed, through, the, day, to, day, functions, of, a, community, instead, emergency, management, focuses, on, the, management, of, disasters, which, are, events, that, produce, more, impacts, than, a, community, can, handle, on, its, own, the, management, of, disasters, tends, to, require, some, combination, of, activity, from, individuals, and, households, organizations, local, and, or, higher, levels, of, government, although, many, different, terminologies, exist, globally, the, activities, of, emergency, management, can, be, generally, categorized, into, preparedness, response, mitigation, and, recovery, although, other, terms, such, as, disaster, risk, reduction, and, prevention, are, also, common, the, outcome, of, emergency, management, is, to, prevent, disasters, and, where, this, is, not, possible, to, reduce, their, harmful, impacts, emergency, planning, aims, to, prevent, emergencies, from, occurring, and, failing, that, initiates, an, efficient, action, plan, to, mitigate, the, results, and, effects, of, any, emergencies, the, development, of, emergency, plans, is, a, cyclical, process, common, to, many, risk, management, disciplines, such, as, business, continuity, and, security, risk, management, wherein, recognition, or, identification, of, risks, as, well, as, ranking, or, evaluation, of, risks, are, important, to, prepare, also, there, are, a, number, of, guidelines, and, publications, regarding, emergency, planning, published, by, professional, organizations, such, as, asis, national, fire, protection, association, nfpa, and, the, international, association, of, emergency, managers, iaem, emergency, management, plans, and, procedures, should, include, the, identification, of, appropriately, trained, staff, members, responsible, for, decision, making, when, an, emergency, occurs, training, plans, should, include, internal, people, contractors, and, civil, protection, partners, and, should, state, the, nature, and, frequency, of, training, and, testing, testing, a, plan, s, effectiveness, should, occur, regularly, in, instances, where, several, businesses, or, organisations, occupy, the, same, space, joint, emergency, plans, formally, agreed, to, by, all, parties, should, be, put, into, place, drills, and, exercises, in, preparation, for, foreseeable, hazards, are, often, held, with, the, participation, of, the, services, that, will, be, involved, in, handling, the, emergency, and, people, who, will, be, affected, drills, are, held, to, prepare, for, the, hazards, of, fires, tornados, lockdown, for, protection, earthquakes, and, others, in, the, u, s, the, government, emergency, telecommunications, service, supports, federal, state, local, and, tribal, government, personnel, industry, and, non, governmental, organizations, during, a, crisis, or, emergency, by, providing, emergency, access, and, priority, handling, for, local, and, long, distance, calls, over, the, public, switched, telephone, network, cleanup, during, disaster, recovery, involves, many, occupational, hazards, often, these, hazards, are, exacerbated, by, the, conditions, of, the, local, environment, as, a, result, of, the, natural, disaster, employers, are, responsible, for, minimizing, exposure, to, these, hazards, and, protecting, workers, when, possible, including, identification, and, thorough, assessment, of, potential, hazards, application, of, appropriate, personal, protective, equipment, ppe, and, the, distribution, of, other, relevant, information, in, order, to, enable, the, safe, performance, of, work, flooding, disasters, often, expose, workers, to, trauma, from, sharp, and, blunt, objects, hidden, under, murky, waters, that, cause, lacerations, and, open, and, closed, fractures, these, injuries, are, further, exacerbated, with, exposure, to, the, often, contaminated, waters, leading, to, increased, risk, for, infection, the, risk, of, hypothermia, significantly, increases, with, prolonged, exposure, to, water, temperatures, less, than, 75, degrees, fahrenheit, 24, c, non, infectious, skin, conditions, may, also, occur, including, miliaria, immersion, foot, syndrome, including, trench, foot, and, contact, dermatitis, earthquake, associated, injuries, are, related, to, building, structural, components, including, falling, debris, with, possible, crush, injury, burns, electric, shock, and, being, trapped, under, rubble, chemicals, can, pose, a, risk, to, human, health, when, exposed, to, humans, in, certain, quantities, after, a, natural, disaster, certain, chemicals, can, become, more, prominent, in, the, environment, these, hazardous, materials, can, be, released, directly, or, indirectly, chemical, hazards, directly, released, after, a, natural, disaster, often, occur, at, the, same, time, as, the, event, impeding, planned, actions, for, mitigation, indirect, release, of, hazardous, chemicals, can, be, intentionally, released, or, unintentionally, released, an, example, of, intentional, release, is, insecticides, used, after, a, flood, or, chlorine, treatment, of, water, after, a, flood, these, chemicals, can, be, controlled, through, engineering, to, minimize, their, release, when, a, natural, disaster, strikes, for, example, agrochemicals, from, inundated, storehouses, or, manufacturing, facilities, poisoning, the, floodwaters, or, asbestos, fibers, released, from, a, building, collapse, during, a, hurricane, the, flowchart, to, the, right, has, been, adopted, from, research, performed, by, stacy, young, et, al, exposure, to, mold, is, commonly, seen, after, a, natural, disaster, such, as, flooding, hurricane, tornado, or, tsunami, mold, growth, can, occur, on, both, the, exterior, and, interior, of, residential, or, commercial, buildings, warm, and, humid, conditions, encourage, mold, growth, while, the, exact, number, of, mold, species, is, unknown, some, examples, of, commonly, found, indoor, molds, are, aspergillus, cladosporium, alternaria, and, penicillium, reaction, to, molds, differ, between, individuals, and, can, range, from, mild, symptoms, such, as, eye, irritation, cough, to, severe, life, threatening, asthmatic, or, allergic, reactions, people, with, history, of, chronic, lung, disease, asthma, allergy, other, breathing, problems, or, those, that, are, immunocompromised, could, be, more, sensitive, to, molds, and, may, develop, fungal, pneumonia, some, methods, to, prevent, mold, growth, after, a, natural, disaster, include, opening, all, doors, and, windows, using, fans, to, dry, out, the, building, positioning, fans, to, blow, air, out, of, the, windows, cleaning, up, the, building, within, the, first, 24, 48, hours, and, moisture, control, when, removing, molds, n, 95, masks, or, respirators, with, a, higher, protection, level, should, be, used, to, prevent, inhalation, of, molds, into, the, respiratory, system, molds, can, be, removed, from, hard, surfaces, by, soap, and, water, a, diluted, bleach, solution, or, commercial, products, for, workers, in, direct, contact, with, human, remains, universal, precautions, should, be, exercised, in, order, to, prevent, unnecessary, exposure, to, blood, borne, viruses, and, bacteria, relevant, ppe, includes, eye, protection, face, mask, or, shield, and, gloves, the, predominant, health, risk, are, gastrointestinal, infections, through, fecal, oral, contamination, so, hand, hygiene, is, paramount, to, prevention, mental, health, support, should, also, be, available, to, workers, who, endure, psychological, stress, during, and, after, recovery, flood, waters, are, often, contaminated, with, bacteria, and, waste, and, chemicals, prolonged, direct, contact, with, these, waters, leads, to, an, increased, risk, for, skin, infection, especially, with, open, wounds, in, the, skin, or, a, history, of, a, previous, skin, condition, such, as, atopic, dermatitis, or, psoriasis, these, infections, are, exacerbated, with, a, compromised, immune, system, or, an, aging, population, the, most, common, bacterial, skin, infections, are, usually, with, staphylococcus, and, streptococcus, one, of, the, most, uncommon, but, well, known, bacterial, infections, is, from, vibrio, vulnificus, which, causes, a, rare, but, often, fatal, infection, called, necrotizing, fasciitis, other, salt, water, mycobacterium, infections, include, the, slow, growing, m, marinum, and, fast, growing, m, fortuitum, m, chelonae, and, m, abscessus, fresh, water, bacterial, infections, include, aeromonas, hydrophila, burkholderia, pseudomallei, causing, melioidosis, leptospira, interrogans, causing, leptospirosis, and, chromobacterium, violaceum, fungal, infections, may, lead, to, chromoblastomycosis, blastomycosis, mucormycosis, and, dermatophytosis, other, numerous, arthropod, protozoal, and, parasitic, infections, have, been, described, a, worker, can, reduce, the, risk, of, flood, associated, skin, infections, by, avoiding, the, water, if, an, open, wound, is, present, or, at, minimum, cover, the, open, wound, with, a, waterproof, bandage, should, contact, with, flood, water, occur, the, open, wound, should, be, washed, thoroughly, with, soap, and, clean, water, according, to, the, cdc, sources, of, stress, for, emergency, responders, may, include, witnessing, human, suffering, risk, of, personal, harm, intense, workloads, life, and, death, decisions, and, separation, from, family, substance, abuse, and, mental, health, services, administration, samhsa, provides, stress, prevention, and, management, resources, for, disaster, recovery, responders, when, an, emergency, situation, occurs, employers, may, be, expected, to, protect, workers, from, all, harm, resulting, from, any, potential, hazard, including, physical, chemical, and, biological, exposure, an, employer, should, provide, pre, emergency, training, and, build, an, emergency, action, plan, eap, employers, should, train, their, employees, annually, before, an, emergency, action, plan, is, implemented, to, inform, employees, of, their, responsibilities, and, or, plan, of, action, during, emergency, situations, the, training, program, should, include, the, types, of, emergencies, that, may, occur, the, appropriate, response, evacuation, procedure, warning, reporting, procedure, and, shutdown, procedures, training, requirements, are, different, depending, on, the, size, of, workplace, and, workforce, processes, used, materials, handled, available, resources, and, who, will, be, in, charge, during, an, emergency, after, the, emergency, action, plan, is, completed, the, employer, and, employees, should, review, the, plan, carefully, and, post, it, in, a, public, area, that, is, accessible, to, everyone, emergency, management, consists, of, five, phases, prevention, mitigation, preparedness, response, and, recovery, preventive, measures, are, taken, at, the, domestic, and, international, levels, and, are, designed, to, provide, permanent, protection, from, disasters, the, risk, of, loss, of, life, and, injury, can, be, mitigated, with, good, evacuation, plans, environmental, planning, and, design, standards, an, example, of, this, is, pandemic, prevention, build, a, minimum, of, two, feet, to, five, above, the, 100, year, flood, level, or, build, to, the, 500, year, flood, height, in, january, 2005, 168, governments, adopted, a, 10, year, plan, to, make, the, world, safer, from, natural, hazards, at, the, world, conference, on, disaster, reduction, held, in, kobe, hyogo, japan, the, results, of, which, were, adapted, in, a, framework, called, the, hyogo, framework, for, action, disaster, mitigation, measures, are, those, that, eliminate, or, reduce, the, impacts, and, risks, of, hazards, through, proactive, measures, taken, before, an, emergency, or, disaster, occurs, preventive, or, mitigation, measures, vary, for, different, types, of, disasters, in, earthquake, prone, areas, these, preventive, measures, might, include, structural, changes, such, as, the, installation, of, an, earthquake, valve, to, instantly, shut, off, the, natural, gas, supply, seismic, retrofits, of, property, and, the, securing, of, items, inside, a, building, the, latter, may, include, the, mounting, of, furniture, refrigerators, water, heaters, and, breakables, to, the, walls, and, the, addition, of, cabinet, latches, in, flood, prone, areas, houses, can, be, built, on, stilts, in, areas, prone, to, prolonged, electricity, black, outs, installation, of, a, generator, ensures, continuation, of, electrical, service, the, construction, of, storm, cellars, and, fallout, shelters, are, further, examples, of, personal, mitigative, actions, the, safe, room, is, a, reinforced, structure, to, provide, near, absolute, protection, in, extreme, wind, events, such, as, tornadoes, and, hurricanes, if, one, window, or, door, breaks, the, roof, is, more, likely, to, blow, off, due, to, the, pressure, wind, coming, into, the, house, closing, all, interior, doors, reduces, the, forces, on, the, roof, doors, windows, and, roofs, rated, for, 195, mph, 314, km, h, winds, are, stronger, during, hurricanes, typhoons, and, tornadoes, hurricane, rated, garage, doors, and, rolling, and, accordion, shutters, at, windows, can, reduce, damages, preparedness, focuses, on, preparing, equipment, and, procedures, for, use, when, a, disaster, occurs, the, equipment, and, procedures, can, be, used, to, reduce, vulnerability, to, disaster, to, mitigate, the, impacts, of, a, disaster, or, to, respond, more, efficiently, in, an, emergency, the, us, federal, emergency, management, agency, fema, proposed, out, a, basic, four, stage, vision, of, preparedness, flowing, from, mitigation, to, preparedness, to, response, to, recovery, and, back, to, mitigation, in, a, circular, planning, process, this, circular, overlapping, model, has, been, modified, by, other, agencies, taught, in, emergency, classes, and, discussed, in, academic, papers, fema, also, operates, a, building, science, branch, that, develops, and, produces, multi, hazard, mitigation, guidance, that, focuses, on, creating, disaster, resilient, communities, to, reduce, loss, of, life, and, property, fema, advises, people, to, prepare, their, homes, with, some, emergency, essentials, in, the, event, food, distribution, lines, are, interrupted, fema, has, subsequently, prepared, for, this, contingency, by, purchasing, hundreds, of, thousands, of, freeze, dried, food, emergency, meals, ready, to, eat, mres, to, dispense, to, the, communities, where, emergency, shelter, and, evacuations, are, implemented, some, guidelines, for, household, preparedness, were, published, online, by, the, state, of, colorado, on, the, topics, of, water, food, tools, and, so, on, emergency, preparedness, can, be, difficult, to, measure, cdc, focuses, on, evaluating, the, effectiveness, of, its, public, health, efforts, through, a, variety, of, measurement, and, assessment, programs, the, preparedness, paradox, is, the, idea, that, the, more, an, individual, or, society, prepares, for, a, disaster, pandemic, or, catastrophe, the, less, the, harm, if, and, when, that, event, occurs, because, the, harm, was, minimized, the, people, then, wonder, whether, the, preparation, was, necessary, disaster, preparation, can, be, hampered, by, several, cognitive, biases, and, features, of, certain, types, of, disasters, preparedness, measures, can, take, many, forms, ranging, from, focusing, on, individual, people, locations, or, incidents, to, broader, government, based, all, hazard, planning, there, are, a, number, of, preparedness, stages, between, all, hazard, and, individual, planning, generally, involving, some, combination, of, both, mitigation, and, response, planning, business, continuity, planning, encourages, businesses, to, have, a, disaster, recovery, plan, community, and, faith, based, organizations, mitigation, efforts, field, response, teams, and, inter, agency, planning, school, based, response, teams, cover, everything, from, live, shooters, to, gas, leaks, and, nearby, bank, robberies, educational, institutions, plan, for, cyberattacks, and, windstorms, industry, specific, guidance, exists, for, horse, farms, boat, owners, and, more, a, 2013, survey, found, that, only, 19, of, american, families, felt, that, they, were, very, prepared, for, a, disaster, the, basic, theme, behind, preparedness, is, to, be, ready, for, an, emergency, and, there, are, a, number, of, different, variations, of, being, ready, based, on, an, assessment, of, what, sort, of, threats, exist, nonetheless, there, is, basic, guidance, for, preparedness, that, is, common, despite, an, area, s, specific, dangers, fema, recommends, that, everyone, have, a, three, day, survival, kit, for, their, household, the, cdc, has, its, own, list, for, a, proper, disaster, supply, kit, like, children, people, with, disabilities, and, other, special, needs, have, special, emergency, preparation, needs, depending, on, the, disability, specific, emergency, preparations, may, be, required, fema, s, suggestions, for, people, with, disabilities, include, having, copies, of, prescriptions, charging, devices, for, medical, devices, such, as, motorized, wheelchairs, and, a, week, s, supply, of, medication, readily, available, or, in, a, go, stay, kit, in, some, instances, a, lack, of, competency, in, english, may, lead, to, special, preparation, requirements, and, communication, efforts, for, both, individuals, and, responders, the, united, states, department, of, energy, states, that, homeowners, business, owners, and, local, leaders, may, have, to, take, an, active, role, in, dealing, with, energy, disruptions, on, their, own, this, active, role, may, include, installing, or, other, procuring, generators, that, are, either, portable, or, permanently, mounted, and, run, on, fuels, such, as, propane, or, natural, gas, or, gasoline, the, united, states, department, of, health, and, human, services, addresses, specific, emergency, preparedness, issues, hospitals, may, have, to, respond, to, including, maintaining, a, safe, temperature, providing, adequate, electricity, for, life, support, systems, and, even, carrying, out, evacuations, under, extreme, circumstances, fema, encourages, all, businesses, to, have, an, emergency, response, plan, and, the, small, business, administration, specifically, advises, small, business, owners, to, also, focus, emergency, preparedness, and, provides, a, variety, of, different, worksheets, and, resources, in, addition, to, emergency, supplies, and, training, for, various, situations, fema, offers, advice, on, how, to, mitigate, disasters, the, agency, gives, instructions, on, how, to, retrofit, a, home, to, minimize, hazards, from, a, flood, to, include, installing, a, backflow, prevention, device, anchoring, fuel, tanks, and, relocating, electrical, panels, given, the, explosive, danger, posed, by, natural, gas, leaks, ready, gov, states, unequivocally, that, it, is, vital, that, all, household, members, know, how, to, shut, off, natural, gas, and, that, property, owners, must, ensure, they, have, any, special, tools, needed, for, their, particular, gas, hookups, ready, gov, also, notes, that, it, is, wise, to, teach, all, responsible, household, members, where, and, how, to, shut, off, the, electricity, cautioning, that, individual, circuits, should, be, shut, off, before, the, main, circuit, ready, gov, further, states, that, it, is, vital, that, all, household, members, learn, how, to, shut, off, the, water, at, the, main, house, valve, and, cautions, that, the, possibility, that, rusty, valves, might, require, replacement, the, response, phase, of, an, emergency, may, commence, with, search, and, rescue, but, in, all, cases, the, focus, will, quickly, turn, to, fulfilling, the, basic, humanitarian, needs, of, the, affected, population, this, assistance, may, be, provided, by, national, or, international, agencies, and, organizations, effective, coordination, of, disaster, assistance, is, often, crucial, particularly, when, many, organizations, respond, and, local, emergency, management, agency, lema, capacity, has, been, exceeded, by, the, demand, or, diminished, by, the, disaster, itself, the, national, response, framework, is, a, united, states, government, publication, that, explains, responsibilities, and, expectations, of, government, officials, at, the, local, state, federal, and, tribal, levels, it, provides, guidance, on, emergency, support, functions, that, may, be, integrated, in, whole, or, parts, to, aid, in, the, response, and, recovery, process, the, response, phase, is, when, preparedness, work, is, adapted, to, the, situation, that, appeared, while, disaster, planning, is, critically, important, the, plans, rarely, match, the, situation, exactly, so, the, plans, need, to, be, adapted, for, example, although, many, airlines, have, disaster, plans, most, of, those, plans, also, assume, that, a, disaster, will, happen, at, an, airport, they, frequently, use, if, they, need, to, deal, with, airplane, crash, in, the, mountains, or, the, ocean, then, the, plan, is, adapted, on, a, personal, level, the, response, can, take, the, shape, either, of, a, shelter, in, place, or, an, evacuation, in, a, shelter, in, place, scenario, a, family, would, be, prepared, to, fend, for, themselves, in, their, home, for, many, days, without, any, form, of, outside, support, in, an, evacuation, a, family, leaves, the, area, by, automobile, or, other, mode, of, transportation, taking, with, them, the, maximum, amount, of, supplies, they, can, carry, possibly, including, a, tent, for, shelter, if, mechanical, transportation, is, not, available, evacuation, on, foot, would, ideally, include, carrying, at, least, three, days, of, supplies, and, rain, tight, bedding, a, tarpaulin, and, a, bedroll, of, blankets, organized, response, includes, evacuation, measures, search, and, rescue, missions, provision, of, other, emergency, services, provision, of, basic, needs, and, recovery, or, ad, hoc, substitution, of, critical, infrastructure, a, range, of, technologies, are, used, for, these, purposes, donations, are, often, sought, during, this, period, especially, for, large, disasters, that, overwhelm, local, capacity, due, to, efficiencies, of, scale, money, is, often, the, most, cost, effective, donation, if, fraud, is, avoided, money, is, also, the, most, flexible, and, if, goods, are, sourced, locally, then, transportation, is, minimized, and, the, local, economy, is, boosted, some, donors, prefer, to, send, gifts, in, kind, however, these, items, can, end, up, creating, issues, rather, than, helping, one, innovation, by, occupy, sandy, volunteers, is, to, use, a, donation, registry, where, families, and, businesses, impacted, by, the, disaster, can, make, specific, requests, which, remote, donors, can, purchase, directly, via, a, web, site, medical, considerations, will, vary, greatly, based, on, the, type, of, disaster, and, secondary, effects, survivors, may, sustain, a, multitude, of, injuries, to, include, lacerations, burns, near, drowning, or, crush, syndrome, amanda, ripley, points, out, that, among, the, general, public, in, fires, and, large, scale, disasters, there, is, a, remarkable, lack, of, panic, and, sometimes, dangerous, denial, of, lack, of, reaction, to, or, rationalization, of, warning, signs, that, should, be, obvious, she, says, that, this, is, often, attributed, to, local, or, national, character, but, appears, to, be, universal, and, is, typically, followed, by, consultations, with, nearby, people, when, the, signals, finally, get, enough, attention, disaster, survivors, advocate, training, everyone, to, recognize, warning, signs, and, practice, responding, the, recovery, phase, starts, after, the, immediate, threat, to, human, life, has, subsided, the, immediate, goal, of, the, recovery, phase, is, to, bring, the, affected, area, back, to, normalcy, as, quickly, as, possible, during, reconstruction, it, is, recommended, to, consider, the, location, or, construction, material, of, the, property, the, most, extreme, home, confinement, scenarios, include, war, famine, and, severe, epidemics, and, may, last, a, year, or, more, then, recovery, will, take, place, inside, the, home, planners, for, these, events, usually, buy, bulk, foods, and, appropriate, storage, and, preparation, equipment, and, eat, the, food, as, part, of, normal, life, a, simple, balanced, diet, can, be, constructed, from, vitamin, pills, whole, grain, wheat, beans, dried, milk, corn, and, cooking, oil, vegetables, fruits, spices, and, meats, both, prepared, and, fresh, gardened, are, included, when, possible, in, the, immediate, aftermath, of, a, disaster, psychological, first, aid, is, provided, by, trained, lay, people, to, assist, disaster, affected, populations, with, coping, and, recovery, trained, workers, offer, practical, support, assistance, with, securing, basic, needs, such, as, food, and, water, and, referrals, to, needed, information, and, services, psychological, first, aid, is, similar, to, medical, first, aid, in, that, providers, do, not, need, to, be, licensed, clinicians, it, is, not, psychotherapy, counseling, or, debriefing, the, goal, of, psychological, first, aid, is, to, help, people, with, their, long, term, recovery, by, offering, social, physical, and, emotional, support, contributing, to, a, hopeful, calm, and, safe, environment, and, enabling, them, to, help, themselves, and, their, communities, research, states, that, mental, health, is, often, neglected, by, first, responders, disaster, can, have, lasting, psychological, impacts, on, those, affected, when, individuals, are, supported, in, processing, their, emotional, experiences, to, the, disaster, this, leads, to, increases, in, resilience, increases, in, the, capacity, to, help, others, through, crises, and, increases, in, community, engagement, when, processing, of, emotional, experiences, is, done, in, a, collective, manner, this, leads, to, greater, solidarity, following, disaster, as, such, emotional, experiences, have, an, inherent, adaptiveness, within, them, however, the, opportunity, for, these, to, be, reflected, on, and, processed, is, necessary, for, this, growth, to, occur, psychological, preparedness, is, a, type, of, emergency, preparedness, and, specific, mental, health, preparedness, resources, are, offered, for, mental, health, professionals, by, organizations, such, as, the, red, cross, these, mental, health, preparedness, resources, are, designed, to, support, both, community, members, affected, by, a, disaster, and, the, disaster, workers, serving, them, cdc, has, a, website, devoted, to, coping, with, a, disaster, or, traumatic, event, after, such, an, event, the, cdc, through, the, substance, abuse, and, mental, health, services, administration, samhsa, suggests, that, people, seek, psychological, help, when, they, exhibit, symptoms, such, as, excessive, worry, crying, frequently, an, increase, in, irritability, anger, and, frequent, arguing, wanting, to, be, alone, most, of, the, time, feeling, anxious, or, fearful, overwhelmed, by, sadness, confused, having, trouble, thinking, clearly, and, concentrating, and, difficulty, making, decisions, increased, alcohol, and, or, substance, use, increased, physical, aches, pains, complaints, such, as, headaches, and, trouble, with, nerves, professional, emergency, managers, can, focus, on, government, and, community, preparedness, or, private, business, preparedness, training, is, provided, by, local, state, federal, and, private, organizations, and, ranges, from, public, information, and, media, relations, to, high, level, incident, command, and, tactical, skills, in, the, past, the, field, of, emergency, management, has, been, populated, mostly, by, people, with, a, military, or, first, responder, background, the, field, has, diversified, with, many, managers, coming, from, a, variety, of, backgrounds, educational, opportunities, are, increasing, for, those, seeking, undergraduate, and, graduate, degrees, in, emergency, management, or, a, related, field, there, are, over, 180, schools, in, the, us, with, emergency, management, related, programs, but, only, one, doctoral, program, specifically, in, emergency, management, professional, certifications, such,
