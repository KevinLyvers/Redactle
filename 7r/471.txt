extant, tamil, literary, works, and, their, commentaries, celebrate, the, pandiyan, kings, for, the, organization, of, long, termed, tamil, sangams, which, researched, developed, and, made, amendments, in, tamil, language, even, though, the, name, of, the, language, which, was, developed, by, these, tamil, sangams, is, mentioned, as, tamil, the, period, when, the, name, tamil, came, to, be, applied, to, the, language, is, unclear, as, is, the, precise, etymology, of, the, name, the, earliest, attested, use, of, the, name, is, found, in, tholkappiyam, which, is, dated, as, early, as, late, 2nd, century, bc, the, hathigumpha, inscription, inscribed, around, a, similar, time, period, 150, bce, by, kharavela, the, jain, king, of, kalinga, also, refers, to, a, tamira, samghatta,

alternatively, he, suggests, a, derivation, of, tami, tam, i, tav, i, tak, i, meaning, in, origin, the, proper, process, of, speaking, however, this, is, deemed, unlikely, by, southworth, due, to, the, contemporary, use, of, the, compound, centami, which, means, refined, speech, in, the, earliest, literature, the, tamil, lexicon, of, university, of, madras, defines, the, word, tamil, as,

9th, century, ad, although, many, of, the, differences, between, tamil, and, malayalam, demonstrate, a, pre, historic, divergence, of, the, western, dialect, the, process, of, separation, into, a, distinct, language, malayalam, was, not, completed, until, sometime, in, the, 13th, or, 14th, century, additionally, kannada, is, also, relatively, close, to, the, tamil, language, and, shares, the, format, of, the, formal, ancient, tamil, language, while, there, are, some, variations, from, the, tamil, language, kannada, still, preserves, a, lot, from, its, roots, as, part, of, the, southern, family, of, indian, languages, and, situated, relatively, close, to, the, northern, parts, of, india, kannada, also, shares, some, sanskrit, words, similar, to, malayalam, many, of, the, formerly, used, words, in, tamil, have, been, preserved, with, little, change, in, kannada, this, shows, a, relative, parallel, to, tamil, even, as, tamil, has, undergone, some, changes, in, modern, ways, of, speaking, according, to, hindu, legend, tamil, or, in, personification, form, tamil, th, i, mother, tamil, was, created, by, lord, shiva, murugan, revered, as, the, tamil, god, along, with, sage, agastya, brought, it, to, the, people, tamil, like, other, dravidian, languages, ultimately, descends, from, the, proto, dravidian, language, which, was, most, likely, spoken, around, the, third, millennium, bc, possibly, in, the, region, around, the, lower, godavari, river, basin, the, material, evidence, suggests, that, the, speakers, of, proto, dravidian, were, of, the, culture, associated, with, the, neolithic, complexes, of, south, india, but, it, has, also, been, related, to, the, harappan, civilization, scholars, categorise, the, attested, history, of, the, language, into, three, periods, old, tamil, 300, bc, ad, 700, middle, tamil, 700, 1600, and, modern, tamil, 1600, present, about, of, the, approximately, 100, 000, inscriptions, found, by, the, archaeological, survey, of, india, in, india, are, in, tamil, nadu, of, them, most, are, in, tamil, with, only, about, 5, percent, in, other, languages, in, 2004, a, number, of, skeletons, were, found, buried, in, earthenware, urns, dating, from, at, least, 696, bc, in, adichanallur, some, of, these, urns, contained, writing, in, tamil, brahmi, script, and, some, contained, skeletons, of, tamil, origin, between, 2017, and,

inscriptions, written, in, brahmi, script, have, been, discovered, in, sri, lanka, and, on, trade, goods, in, thailand, and, egypt, in, november, 2007, an, excavation, at, quseir, al, qadim, revealed, egyptian, pottery, dating, back, to, first, century, bc, with, ancient, tamil, brahmi, inscriptions, there, are, a, number, of, apparent, tamil, loanwords, in, biblical, hebrew, dating, to, before, 500, bc, the, oldest, attestation, of, the, language, old, tamil, is, the, period, of, the, tamil, language, spanning, the, 3rd, century, bc, to, the, 8th, century, ad, the, earliest, records, in, old, tamil, are, short, inscriptions, from, 300, bc, to, 700, ad, these, inscriptions, are, written, in, a, variant, of, the, brahmi, script, called, tamil, brahmi, the, earliest, long, text, in, old, tamil, is, the, tolk, ppiyam, an, early, work, on, tamil, grammar, and, poetics, whose, oldest, layers, could, be, as, old, as, the, late, 2nd, century, bc, many, literary, works, in, old, tamil, have, also, survived, these, include, a, corpus, of, 2, 381, poems, collectively, known, as, sangam, literature, these, poems, are, usually, dated, to, between, the, 1st, century, bc, and, 5th, century, ad, the, evolution, of, old, tamil, into, middle, tamil, which, is, generally, taken, to, have, been, completed, by, the, 8th, century, was, characterised, by, a, number, of, phonological, and, grammatical, changes, in, phonological, terms, the, most, important, shifts, were, the, virtual, disappearance, of, the, aytam, an, old, phoneme, the, coalescence, of, the, alveolar, and, dental, nasals, and, the, transformation, of, the, alveolar, plosive, into, a, rhotic, in, grammar, the, most, important, change, was, the, emergence, of, the, present, tense, the, present, tense, evolved, out, of, the, verb, kil, meaning, to, be, possible, or, to, befall, in, old, tamil, this, verb, was, used, as, an, aspect, marker, to, indicate, that, an, action, was, micro, durative, non, sustained, or, non, lasting, usually, in, combination, with, a, time, marker, such, as, in, middle, tamil, this, usage, evolved, into, a, present, tense, marker, ki, a, which, combined, the, old, aspect, and, time, markers, the, nann, l, remains, the, standard, normative, grammar, for, modern, literary, tamil, which, therefore, continues, to, be, based, on, middle, tamil, of, the, 13th, century, rather, than, on, modern, tamil, colloquial, spoken, tamil, in, contrast, shows, a, number, of, changes, the, negative, conjugation, of, verbs, for, example, has, fallen, out, of, use, in, modern, tamil, instead, negation, is, expressed, either, morphologically, or, syntactically, modern, spoken, tamil, also, shows, a, number, of, sound, changes, in, particular, a, tendency, to, lower, high, vowels, in, initial, and, medial, positions, and, the, disappearance, of, vowels, between, plosives, and, between, a, plosive, and, rhotic, contact, with, european, languages, affected, written, and, spoken, tamil, changes, in, written, tamil, include, the, use, of, european, style, punctuation, and, the, use, of, consonant, clusters, that, were, not, permitted, in, middle, tamil, the, syntax, of, written, tamil, has, also, changed, with, the, introduction, of, new, aspectual, auxiliaries, and, more, complex, sentence, structures, and, with, the, emergence, of, a, more, rigid, word, order, that, resembles, the, syntactic, argument, structure, of, english, in, 1578, portuguese, christian, missionaries, published, a, tamil, prayer, book, in, old, tamil, script, named, thambiran, vanakkam, thus, making, tamil, the, first, indian, language, to, be, printed, and, published, the, tamil, lexicon, published, by, the, university, of, madras, was, one, of, the, earliest, dictionaries, published, in, indian, languages, a, strong, strain, of, linguistic, purism, emerged, in, the, early, 20th, century, culminating, in, the, pure, tamil, movement, which, called, for, removal, of, all, sanskritic, elements, from, tamil, it, received, some, support, from, dravidian, parties, this, led, to, the, replacement, of, a, significant, number, of, sanskrit, loanwords, by, tamil, equivalents, though, many, others, remain, according, to, a, 2001, survey, there, were, 1, 863, newspapers, published, in, tamil, of, which, 353, were, dailies, tamil, is, the, primary, language, of, the, majority, of, the, people, residing, in, tamil, nadu, puducherry, in, india, and, in, the, northern, and, eastern, provinces, of, sri, lanka, the, language, is, spoken, among, small, minority, groups,

characterised, by, diglossia, there, are, two, separate, registers, varying, by, socioeconomic, status, a, high, register, and, a, low, one, tamil, dialects, are, primarily, differentiated, from, each, other, by, the, fact, that, they, have, undergone, different, phonological, changes, and, sound, shifts, in, evolving, from, old, tamil, for, example, the, word, for, here, i, ku, in, centamil, the, classic, variety, has, evolved, into, i, k, in, the, kongu, dialect, of, coimbatore, inga, in, the, dialects, of, thanjavur, and, palakkad, and, i, kai, in, some, dialects, of, sri, lanka, old, tamil, s, i, ka, where, ka, means, place, is, the, source, of, i, kane, in, the, dialect, of, tirunelveli, old, tamil, i, ki, u, is, the, source, of, i, ku, u, in, the, dialect, of, madurai, and, i, ka, e, in, some, northern, dialects, even, now, in, the, coimbatore, area, it, is, common, to, hear, akka, a, meaning, that, place, although, tamil, dialects, do, not, differ, significantly, in, their, vocabulary, there, are, a, few, exceptions, the, dialects, spoken, in, sri, lanka, retain, many, words, and, grammatical, forms, that, are, not, in, everyday, use, in, india, and, use, many, other, words, slightly, differently, tamil, dialects, include, central, tamil, dialect, kongu, tamil, madras, bashai, madurai, tamil, nellai, tamil, kumari, tamil, in, india, batticaloa, tamil, dialect, jaffna, tamil, dialect, negombo, tamil, dialect, in, sri, lanka, and, malaysian, tamil, in, malaysia, sankethi, dialect, in, karnataka, has, been, heavily, influenced, by, kannada, the, dialect, of, the, district, of, palakkad, in, kerala, has, many, malayalam, loanwords, has, been, influenced, by, malayalam, s, syntax, and, has, a, distinctive, malayalam, accent, similarly, tamil, spoken, in, kanyakumari, district, has, more, unique, words, and, phonetic, style, than, tamil, spoken, at, other, parts, of, tamil, nadu, the, words, and, phonetics, are, so, different, that, a, person, from, kanyakumari, district, is, easily, identifiable, by, their, spoken, tamil, hebbar, and, mandyam, dialects, spoken, by, groups, of, tamil, vaishnavites, who, migrated, to, karnataka, in, the, 11th, century, retain, many, features, of, the, vaishnava, paribasai, a, special, form, of, tamil, developed, in, the, 9th, and, 10th, centuries, that, reflect, vaishnavite, religious, and, spiritual, values, several, castes, have, their, own, sociolects, which, most, members, of, that, caste, traditionally, used, regardless, of, where, they, come, from, it, is, often, possible, to, identify, a, person, s, caste, by, their, speech, for, example, tamil, brahmins, tend, to, speak, a, variety, of, dialects, that, are, all, collectively, known, as, brahmin, tamil, these, dialects, tend, to, have, softer, consonants, with, consonant, deletion, also, common, these, dialects, also, tend, to, have, many, sanskrit, loanwords, tamil, in, sri, lanka, incorporates, loan, words, from, portuguese, dutch, and, english, in, addition, to, its, dialects, tamil, exhibits, different, forms, a, classical, literary, style, modelled, on, the, ancient, language, sankattami, a, modern, literary, and, formal, style, centami, and, a, modern, colloquial, form, ko, untami, these, styles, shade, into, each, other, forming, a, stylistic, continuum, for, example, it, is, possible, to, write, centami, with, a, vocabulary, drawn, from, ca, kattami, or, to, use, forms, associated, with, one, of, the, other, variants, while, speaking, ko, untami, in, modern, times, centami, is, generally, used, in, formal, writing, and, speech, for, instance, it, is, the, language, of, textbooks, of, much, of, tamil, literature, and, of, public, speaking, and, debate, in, recent, times, however, ko, untami, has, been, making, inroads, into, areas, that, have, traditionally, been, considered, the, province, of, centami, most, contemporary, cinema, theatre, and, popular, entertainment, on, television, and, radio, for, example, is, in, ko, untami, and, many, politicians, use, it, to, bring, themselves, closer, to, their, audience, the, increasing, use, of, ko, untami, in, modern, times, has, led, to, the, emergence, of, unofficial, standard, spoken, dialects, in, india, the, standard, ko, untami, rather, than, on, any, one, dialect, but, has, been, significantly, influenced, by, the, dialects, of, thanjavur, and, madurai, in, sri, lanka, the, standard, is, based, on, the, dialect, of, jaffna, after, tamil, brahmi, fell, out, of, use, tamil, was, written, using, a, script, called, va, e, uttu, amongst, others, such, as, grantha, and, pallava, the, current, tamil, script, consists, of, 12, vowels, 18, consonants, and, one, special, character, the, ytam, the, vowels, and, consonants, combine, to, form, 216, compound, characters, giving, a, total, of, 247, characters, 12, 18, 1, 12, 18, all, consonants, have, an, inherent, vowel, a, as, with, other, indic, scripts, this, inherent, vowel, is, removed, by, adding, a, tittle, called, a, pu, i, to, the, consonantal, sign, for, example, is, a, with, the, inherent, a, and, is, without, a, vowel, many, indic, scripts, have, a, similar, sign, generically, called, virama, but, the, tamil, script, is, somewhat, different, in, that, it, nearly, always, uses, a, visible, pu, i, to, indicate, a, dead, consonant, a, consonant, without, a, vowel, in, other, indic, scripts, it, is, generally, preferred, to, use, a, ligature, or, a, half, form, to, write, a, syllable, or, a, cluster, containing, a, dead, consonant, although, writing, it, with, a, visible, virama, is, also, possible, the, tamil, script, does, not, differentiate, voiced, and, unvoiced, plosives, instead, plosives, are, articulated, with, voice, depending, on, their, position, in, a, word, in, accordance, with, the, rules, of, tamil, phonology, in, addition, to, the, standard, characters, six, characters, taken, from, the, grantha, script, which, was, used, in, the, tamil, region, to, write, sanskrit, are, sometimes, used, to, represent, sounds, not, native, to, tamil, that, is, words, adopted, from, sanskrit, prakrit, and, other, languages, the, traditional, system, prescribed, by, classical, grammars, for, writing, loan, words, which, involves, respelling, them, in, accordance, with, tamil, phonology, remains, but, is, not, always, consistently, applied, iso, 15919, is, an, international, standard, for, the, transliteration, of, tamil, and, other, indic, scripts, into, latin, characters, it, uses, diacritics, to, map, the, much, larger, set, of, brahmic, consonants, and, vowels, to, latin, script, and, thus, the, alphabets, of, various, languages, including, english, apart, from, the, usual, numerals, tamil, has, numerals, for, 10, 100, and, 1000, symbols, for, day, month, year, debit, credit, as, above, rupee, and, numeral, are, present, as, well, tamil, also, uses, several, historical, fractional, signs, f, z, and, are, only, found, in, loanwords, and, may, be, considered, marginal, phonemes, though, they, are, traditionally, not, seen, as, fully, phonemic, tamil, has, two, diphthongs, a, and, a, the, latter, of, which, is, restricted, to, a, few, lexical, items, tamil, employs, agglutinative, grammar, where, suffixes, are, used, to, mark, noun, class, number, and, case, verb, tense, and, other, grammatical, categories, tamil, s, standard, metalinguistic, terminology, and, scholarly, vocabulary, is, itself, tamil, as, opposed, to, the, sanskrit, that, is, standard, for, most, indo, aryan, languages, much, of, tamil, grammar, is, extensively, described, in, the, oldest, known, grammar, book, for, tamil, the, tolk, ppiyam, modern, tamil, writing, is, largely, based, on, the, 13th, century, grammar, na, l, which, restated, and, clarified, the, rules, of, the, tolk, ppiyam, with, some, modifications, traditional, tamil, grammar, consists, of, five, parts, namely, e, uttu, col, poru, y, ppu, a, i, of, these, the, last, two, are, mostly, applied, in, poetry, tamil, words, consist, of, a, lexical, root, to, which, one, or, more, affixes, are, attached, most, tamil, affixes, are, suffixes, tamil, suffixes, can, be, derivational, suffixes, which, either, change, the, part, of, speech, of, the, word, or, its, meaning, or, inflectional, suffixes, which, mark, categories, such, as, person, number, mood, tense, etc, there, is, no, absolute, limit, on, the, length, and, extent, of, agglutination, which, can, lead, to, long, words, with, many, suffixes, which, would, require, several, words, or, a, sentence, in, english, to, give, an, example, the, word, p, kamu, iy, tavarka, ukk, ka, means, for, the, sake, of, those, who, cannot, go, and, consists, of, the, following, morphemes, p, ka, go, mu, i, accomplish, t, neg, imprs, a, ptcp, var, nmlz, ka, pl, ukku, to, ka, for, p, ka, mu, i, t, a, var, ka, ukku, ka, go, accomplish, neg, imprs, ptcp, nmlz, pl, to, for, tamil, nouns, and, pronouns, are, classified, into, two, super, classes, ti, ai, the, rational, uyarti, ai, and, the, irrational, ak, i, ai, which, include, a, total, of, five, classes, p, l,

nonetheless, a, number, of, words, used, in, classical, and, modern, tamil, are, loanwords, from, the, languages, of, neighbouring, groups, or, with, whom, the, tamils, had, trading, links, including, malay, e, g, cavvarici, sago, from, malay, s, gu, chinese, for, example, camp, n, skiff, from, chinese, san, pan, and, greek, for, example, ora, from, greek, in, more, modern, times, tamil, has,

and, literary, styles, reflecting, the, increased, trend, of, sanskritisation, in, the, tamil, country, tamil, vocabulary, never, became, quite, as, heavily, sanskritised, as, that, of, the, other, dravidian, languages, and, unlike, in, those, languages, it, was, and, remains, possible, to, express, complex, ideas, including, in, science, art, religion, and, law, without, the, use, of, sanskrit, loan, words, in, addition, sanskritisation, was, actively, resisted, by, a, number, of, authors, of, the, late, medieval, period, culminating, in, the, 20th, century, in, a, movement, called, ta, it, tami, iyakkam, meaning, pure, tamil, movement, led, by, parithimaar, kalaignar, and, maraimalai, adigal, which, sought, to, remove, the, accumulated, influence, of, sanskrit, on, tamil, as, a, result, of, this, tamil, in, formal, documents, literature, and, public, speeches, has, seen, a, marked, decline, in, the, use, sanskrit, loan, words, in, the, past, few, decades, under, some, estimates, having, fallen, from, 40, to, 50, to, about, 20, as, a, result, the, prakrit, and, sanskrit, loan, words, used, in, modern, tamil, are, unlike, in, some, other, dravidian, languages, restricted, mainly, to, some, spiritual, terminology, and, abstract, nouns, in, the, 20th, century, institutions, and, learned, bodies, have, with, government, support, generated, technical, dictionaries, for, tamil, containing, neologisms, and, words, derived, from, tamil, roots, to, replace, loan, words, from, english, and, other, languages, as, of, 2019, the, language, had, a, listed, vocabulary, of, over, 470, 000, unique, words, including, those, from, old, literary, sources, in, november, 2019, the, state, government, issued, an, order, to, add, 9, 000, new, words, to, the, vocabulary, words,
