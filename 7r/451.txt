10, million, people, including, ethnic, minorities, in, myanmar, like, the, mon, and, also, by, those, in, neighboring, countries, in, 2022, the, burmese, speaking, population, was, 38, 8, million, burmese, is, a, tonal, pitch, register, and, syllable, timed, language, largely, monosyllabic, and, agglutinative, with, a, subject, object, verb, word, order, it, is, a, member, of, the, lolo, burmese, grouping, of, the, sino, tibetan, language, family, the, burmese, alphabet, is, ultimately, descended, from, a, brahmic, script, either, the, kadamba, or, pallava, alphabets, burmese, belongs, to, the, southern, burmish, branch, of, the, sino, tibetan, languages, of, which, burmese, is, the, most, widely, spoken, of, the, non, sinitic, languages, burmese, was, the, fifth, of, the, sino, tibetan, languages, to, develop, a, writing, system, after, classical, chinese, pyu, old, tibetan, and, tangut, the, majority, of, burmese, speakers, who, live, throughout, the, irrawaddy, river, valley, use, a, number, of, largely, similar, dialects, while, a, minority, speak, non, standard, dialects, found, in, the, peripheral, areas, of, the, country, these, dialects, include, arakanese, in, rakhine, state, and, marma, in, bangladesh, are, also, sometimes, considered, dialects, of, burmese, and, sometimes, as, separate, languages, despite, vocabulary, and, pronunciation, differences, there, is, mutual, intelligibility, among, burmese, dialects, as, they, share, a, common, set, of, tones, consonant, clusters, and, written, script, however, several, burmese, dialects, differ, substantially, from, standard, burmese, with, respect, to, vocabulary, lexical, particles, and, rhymes, spoken, burmese, is, remarkably, uniform, among, burmese, speakers, particularly, those, living, in, the, irrawaddy, valley, all, of, whom, use, variants, of, standard, burmese, the, standard, dialect, of, burmese, the, mandalay, yangon, dialect, continuum, comes, from, the, irrawaddy, river, valley, regional, differences, between, speakers, from, upper, burma, e, g, mandalay, dialect, called, anya, tha, and, speakers, from, lower, burma, e, g, yangon, dialect, called, auk, tha, largely, occur, in, vocabulary, choice, not, in, pronunciation, minor, lexical, and, pronunciation, differences, exist, throughout, the, irrawaddy, river, valley, for, instance, for, the, term, food, offering, lower, burmese, speakers, use, instead, of, which, is, the, pronunciation, used, in, upper, burma, the, standard, dialect, is, represented, by, the, yangon, dialect, because, of, the, modern, city, s, media, influence, and, economic, clout, in, the, past, the, mandalay, dialect, represented, standard, burmese, the, most, noticeable, feature, of, the, mandalay, dialect, is, its, use, of, the, first, person, pronoun, kya, nau, by, both, men, and, women, whereas, in, yangon, the, said, pronoun, is, used, only, by, male, speakers, while, kya, ma, is, used, by, female, speakers, moreover, with, regard, to, kinship, terminology, upper, burmese, speakers, differentiate, the, maternal, and, paternal, sides, of, a, family, whereas, lower, burmese, speakers, do, not, the, mon, language, has, also, influenced, subtle, grammatical, differences, between, the, varieties, of, burmese, spoken, in, lower, and, upper, burma, in, lower, burmese, varieties, the, verb, to, give, is, colloquially, used, as, a, permissive, causative, marker, like, in, other, southeast, asian, languages, but, unlike, in, other, tibeto, burman, languages, this, usage, is, hardly, used, in, upper, burmese, varieties, and, is, considered, a, sub, standard, construct, more, distinctive, non, standard, varieties, emerge, as, one, moves, farther, away, from, the, irrawaddy, river, valley, toward, peripheral, areas, of, the, country, these, varieties, include, the, yaw, palaw, myeik, merguese, tavoyan, and, intha, dialects, despite, substantial, vocabulary, and, pronunciation, differences, there, is, mutual, intelligibility, among, most, burmese, dialects, below, is, a, summary, of, lexical, similarity, between, major, burmese, dialects, dialects, in, tanintharyi, region, including, palaw, merguese, and, tavoyan, are, especially, conservative, in, comparison, to, standard, burmese, the, tavoyan, and, intha, dialects, have, preserved, the, l, medial, which, is, otherwise, only, found, in, old, burmese, inscriptions, they, also, often, reduce, the, intensity, of, the, glottal, stop, beik, has, 250, 000, speakers, while, tavoyan, has, 400, 000, the, grammatical, constructs, of, burmese, dialects, in, southern, myanmar, show, greater, mon, influence, than, standard, burmese, the, most, pronounced, feature, of, the, arakanese, language, of, rakhine, state, is, its, retention, of, the, sound, which, has, become, in, standard, burmese, moreover, arakanese, features, a, variety, of, vowel, differences, including, the, merger, of, the, and, vowels, hence, a, word, like, blood, is, pronounced, in, standard, burmese, and, in, arakanese, the, burmese, language, s, early, forms, include, old, burmese, and, middle, burmese, old, burmese, dates, from, the, 11th, to, the, 16th, century, pagan, to, ava, dynasties, middle, burmese, from, the, 16th, to, the, 18th, century, toungoo, to, early, konbaung, dynasties, modern, burmese, from, the, mid, 18th, century, to, the, present, word, order, grammatical, structure, and, vocabulary, have, remained, markedly, stable, well, into, modern, burmese, with, the, exception, of, lexical, content, e, g, function, words, the, earliest, attested, form, of, the, burmese, language, is, called, old, burmese, dating, to, the, 11th, and, 12th, century, stone, inscriptions, of, pagan, the, earliest, evidence, of, the, burmese, alphabet, is, dated, to, 1035, while, a, casting, made, in, the, 18th, century, of, an, old, stone, inscription, points, to, 984, owing, to, the, linguistic, prestige, of, old, pyu, in, the, pagan, kingdom, era, old, burmese, borrowed, a, substantial, corpus, of, vocabulary, from, pali, via, the, pyu, language, these, indirect, borrowings, can, be, traced, back, to, orthographic, idiosyncrasies, in, these, loanwords, such, as, the, burmese, word, to, worship, which, is, spelt, p, jo, instead, of, p, j, as, would, be, expected, by, the, original, pali, orthography, the, transition, to, middle, burmese, occurred, in, the, 16th, century, the, transition, to, middle, burmese, included, phonological, changes, e, g, mergers, of, sound, pairs, that, were, distinct, in, old, burmese, as, well, as, accompanying, changes, in, the, underlying, orthography, from, the, 1500s, onward, burmese, kingdoms, saw, substantial, gains, in, the, populace, s, literacy, rate, which, manifested, itself, in, greater, participation, of, laymen, in, scribing, and, composing, legal, and, historical, documents, domains, that, were, traditionally, the, domain, of, buddhist, monks, and, drove, the, ensuing, proliferation, of, burmese, literature, both, in, terms, of, genres, and, works, during, this, period, the, burmese, alphabet, began, employing, cursive, style, circular, letters, typically, used, in, palm, leaf, manuscripts, as, opposed, to, the, traditional, square, block, form, letters, used, in, earlier, periods, the, orthographic, conventions, used, in, written, burmese, today, can, largely, be, traced, back, to, middle, burmese, modern, burmese, emerged, in, the, mid, 18th, century, by, this, time, male, literacy, in, burma, stood, at, nearly, 50, which, enabled, the, wide, circulation, of, legal, texts, royal, chronicles, and, religious, texts, a, major, reason, for, the, uniformity, of, the, burmese, language, was, the, near, universal, presence, of, buddhist, monasteries, called, kyaung, in, burmese, villages, these, kyaung, served, as, the, foundation, of, the, pre, colonial, monastic, education, system, which, fostered, uniformity, of, the, language, throughout, the, upper, irrawaddy, valley, the, traditional, homeland, of, burmese, speakers, the, 1891, census, of, india, conducted, five, years, after, the, annexation, of, the, entire, konbaung, kingdom, found, that, the, former, kingdom, had, an, unusually, high, male, literacy, rate, of, 62, 5, for, upper, burmans, aged, 25, and, above, for, all, of, british, burma, the, literacy, rate, was, 49, for, men, and, 5, 5, for, women, by, contrast, british, india, more, broadly, had, a, male, literacy, rate, of, 8, 44, the, expansion, of, the, burmese, language, into, lower, burma, also, coincided, with, the, emergence, of, modern, burmese, as, late, as, the, mid, 1700s, mon, an, austroasiatic, language, was, the, principal, language, of, lower, burma, employed, by, the, mon, people, who, inhabited, the, region, lower, burma, s, shift, from, mon, to, burmese, was, accelerated, by, the, burmese, speaking, konbaung, dynasty, s, victory, over, the, mon, speaking, restored, hanthawaddy, kingdom, in, 1757, by, 1830, an, estimated, 90, of, the, population, in, lower, burma, self, identified, as, burmese, speaking, bamars, huge, swaths, of, former, mon, speaking, territory, from, the, irrawaddy, delta, to, upriver, in, the, north, spanning, bassein, now, pathein, and, rangoon, now, yangon, to, tharrawaddy, toungoo, prome, now, pyay, and, henzada, now, hinthada, were, now, burmese, speaking, the, language, shift, has, been, ascribed, to, a, combination, of, population, displacement, intermarriage, and, voluntary, changes, in, self, identification, among, increasingly, mon, burmese, bilingual, populations, in, the, region, standardized, tone, marking, in, written, burmese, was, not, achieved, until, the, 18th, century, from, the, 19th, century, onward, orthographers, created, spellers, to, reform, burmese, spelling, because, of, ambiguities, that, arose, over, transcribing, sounds, that, had, been, merged, british, rule, saw, continued, efforts, to, standardize, burmese, spelling, through, dictionaries, and, spellers, britain, s, gradual, annexation, of, burma, throughout, the, 19th, century, in, addition, to, concomitant, economic, and, political, instability, in, upper, burma, e, g, increased, tax, burdens, from, the, burmese, crown, british, rice, production, incentives, etc, also, accelerated, the, migration, of, burmese, speakers, from, upper, burma, into, lower, burma, british, rule, in, burma, eroded, the, strategic, and, economic, importance, of, the, burmese, language, burmese, was, effectively, subordinated, to, the, english, language, in, the, colonial, educational, system, especially, in, higher, education, in, the, 1930s, the, burmese, language, saw, a, linguistic, revival, precipitated, by, the, establishment, of, an, independent, university, of, rangoon, in, 1920, and, the, inception, of, a, burmese, language, major, at, the, university, by, pe, maung, tin, modeled, on, anglo, saxon, language, studies, at, the, university, of, oxford, student, protests, in, december, of, that, year, triggered, by, the, introduction, of, english, into, matriculation, examinations, fueled, growing, demand, for, burmese, to, become, the, medium, of, education, in, british, burma, a, short, lived, but, symbolic, parallel, system, of, national, schools, that, taught, in, burmese, was, subsequently, launched, the, role, and, prominence, of, the, burmese, language, in, public, life, and, institutions, was, championed, by, burmese, nationalists, intertwined, with, their, demands, for, greater, autonomy, and, independence, from, the, british, in, the, lead, up, to, the, independence, of, burma, in, 1948, the, 1948, constitution, of, burma, prescribed, burmese, as, the, official, language, of, the, newly, independent, nation, the, burma, translation, society, and, rangoon, university, s, department, of, translation, and, publication, were, established, in, 1947, and, 1948, respectively, with, the, joint, goal, of, modernizing, the, burmese, language, in, order, to, replace, english, across, all, disciplines, anti, colonial, sentiment, throughout, the, early, post, independence, era, led, to, a, reactionary, switch, from, english, to, burmese, as, the, national, medium, of, education, a, process, that, was, accelerated, by, the, burmese, way, to, socialism, in, august, 1963, the, socialist, union, revolutionary, government, established, the, literary, and, translation, commission, the, immediate, precursor, of, the, myanmar, language, commission, to, standardize, burmese, spelling, diction, composition, and, terminology, the, latest, spelling, authority, named, the, myanma, salonpaung, thatpon, kyan, was, compiled, in, 1978, by, the, commission, burmese, is, a, diglossic, language, with, two, distinguishable, registers, or, diglossic, varieties, the, literary, form, of, burmese, retains, archaic, and, conservative, grammatical, structures, and, modifiers, including, affixes, and, pronouns, no, longer, used, in, the, colloquial, form, literary, burmese, which, has, not, changed, significantly, since, the, 13th, century, is, the, register, of, burmese, taught, in, schools, in, most, cases, the, corresponding, affixes, in, the, literary, and, spoken, forms, are, totally, unrelated, to, each, other, examples, of, this, phenomenon, include, the, following, lexical, terms, historically, the, literary, register, was, preferred, for, written, burmese, on, the, grounds, that, the, spoken, style, lacks, gravity, authority, dignity, in, the, mid, 1960s, some, burmese, writers, spearheaded, efforts, to, abandon, the, literary, form, asserting, that, the, spoken, vernacular, form, ought, to, be, used, some, burmese, linguists, such, as, minn, latt, a, czech, academic, proposed, moving, away, from, the, high, form, of, burmese, altogether, although, the, literary, form, is, heavily, used, in, written, and, official, contexts, literary, and, scholarly, works, radio, news, broadcasts, and, novels, the, recent, trend, has, been, to, accommodate, the, spoken, form, in, informal, written, contexts, nowadays, television, news, broadcasts, comics, and, commercial, publications, use, the, spoken, form, or, a, combination, of, the, spoken, and, simpler, less, ornate, formal, forms, the, following, sample, sentence, reveals, that, differences, between, literary, and, spoken, burmese, mostly, occur, in, affixes, burmese, has, politeness, levels, and, honorifics, that, take, the, speaker, s, status, and, age, in, relation, to, the, audience, into, account, the, suffix, pa, is, frequently, used, after, a, verb, to, express, politeness, moreover, burmese, pronouns, relay, varying, degrees, of, deference, or, respect, in, many, instances, polite, speech, e, g, addressing, teachers, officials, or, elders, employs, feudal, era, third, person, pronouns, or, kinship, terms, in, lieu, of, first, and, second, person, pronouns, furthermore, with, regard, to, vocabulary, choice, spoken, burmese, clearly, distinguishes, the, buddhist, clergy, monks, from, the, laity, householders, especially, when, speaking, to, or, about, bhikkhus, monks, the, following, are, examples, of, varying, vocabulary, used, for, buddhist, clergy, and, for, laity, burmese, primarily, has, a, monosyllabic, received, sino, tibetan, vocabulary, nonetheless, many, words, especially, loanwords, from, indo, european, languages, like, english, are, polysyllabic, and, others, from, mon, an, austroasiatic, language, are, sesquisyllabic, burmese, loanwords, are, overwhelmingly, in, the, form, of, nouns, historically, pali, the, liturgical, language, of, theravada, buddhism, had, a, profound, influence, on, burmese, vocabulary, burmese, has, readily, adopted, words, of, pali, origin, this, may, be, due, to, phonotactic, similarities, between, the, two, languages, alongside, the, fact, that, the, script, used, for, burmese, can, be, used, to, reproduce, pali, spellings, with, complete, accuracy, pali, loanwords, are, often, related, to, religion, government, arts, and, science, burmese, loanwords, from, pali, primarily, take, four, forms, burmese, has, also, adapted, numerous, words, from, mon, traditionally, spoken, by, the, mon, people, who, until, recently, formed, the, majority, in, lower, burma, most, mon, loanwords, are, so, well, assimilated, that, they, are, not, distinguished, as, loanwords, as, burmese, and, mon, were, used, interchangeably, for, several, centuries, in, pre, colonial, burma, mon, loans, are, often, related, to, flora, fauna, administration, textiles, foods, boats, crafts, architecture, and, music, as, a, natural, consequence, of, british, rule, in, burma, english, has, been, another, major, source, of, vocabulary, especially, with, regard, to, technology, measurements, and, modern, institutions, english, loanwords, tend, to, take, one, of, three, forms, to, a, lesser, extent, burmese, has, also, imported, words, from, sanskrit, religion, hindi, food, administration, and, shipping, and, chinese, games, and, food, burmese, has, also, imported, a, handful, of, words, from, other, european, languages, such, as, portuguese, here, is, a, sample, of, loan, words, found, in, burmese, since, the, end, of, british, rule, the, burmese, government, has, attempted, to, limit, usage, of, western, loans, especially, from, english, by, coining, new, words, neologisms, for, instance, for, the, word, television, burmese, publications, are, mandated, to, use, the, term, lit, see, picture, hear, sound, in, lieu, of, a, direct, english, transliteration, another, example, is, the, word, vehicle, which, is, officially, derived, from, pali, but, from, english, car, in, spoken, burmese, some, previously, common, english, loanwords, have, fallen, out, of, use, with, the, adoption, of, neologisms, an, example, is, the, word, university, formerly, from, english, university, now, a, pali, derived, neologism, recently, created, by, the, burmese, government, and, derived, from, the, pali, spelling, of, taxila, takkas, la, an, ancient, university, town, in, modern, day, pakistan, some, words, in, burmese, may, have, many, synonyms, each, having, certain, usages, such, as, formal, literary, colloquial, and, poetic, one, example, is, the, word, moon, which, can, be, la, native, tibeto, burman, derivatives, of, pali, canda, moon, or, sanskrit, the, consonants, of, burmese, are, as, follows, according, to, jenny, san, san, hnin, tun, 2016, 15, contrary, to, their, use, of, symbols, and, consonants, of, are, dental, stops, t, d, rather, than, fricatives, or, affricates, these, phonemes, alongside, s, are, prone, to, merger, with, t, d, s, an, alveolar, can, occur, as, an, alternate, of, j, in, some, loanwords, the, final, nasal, is, the, value, of, the, four, native, final, nasals, m, n, as, well, as, the, retroflex, used, in, pali, loans, and, nasalisation, mark, anusvara, demonstrated, here, above, ka, which, most, often, stands, in, for, a, homorganic, nasal, word, medially, as, in, tankh, door, and, tant, bridge, or, else, replaces, final, m, in, both, pali, and, native, vocabulary, especially, after, the, ob, vowel, u, e, g, ngam, salty, th, um, three, use, and, s, um, end, it, does, not, however, apply, to, which, is, never, realised, as, a, nasal, but, rather, as, an, open, front, vowel, or, the, final, nasal, is, usually, realised, as, nasalisation, of, the, vowel, it, may, also, allophonically, appear, as, a, homorganic, nasal, before, stops, for, example, in, m, d, storm, which, is, pronounced, the, vowels, of, burmese, are, the, monophthongs, e, o, and, occur, only, in, open, syllables, those, without, a, syllable, coda, the, diphthongs, ei, ou, ai, and, au, occur, only, in, closed, syllables, those, with, a, syllable, coda, only, occurs, in, a, minor, syllable, and, is, the, only, vowel, that, is, permitted, in, a, minor, syllable, see, below, the, close, vowels, i, and, u, and, the, close, portions, of, the, diphthongs, are, somewhat, mid, centralized, in, closed, syllables, i, e, before, and, thus, n, i, two, is, phonetically, and, t, cat, is, phonetically, burmese, is, a, tonal, language, which, means, phonemic, contrasts, can, be, made, on, the, basis, of, the, tone, of, a, vowel, in, burmese, these, contrasts, involve, not, only, pitch, but, also, phonation, intensity, loudness, duration, and, vowel, quality, however, some, linguists, consider, burmese, a, pitch, register, language, like, shanghainese, there, are, four, contrastive, tones, in, burmese, in, the, following, table, the, tones, are, shown, marked, on, the, vowel, a, as, an, example, for, example, the, following, words, are, distinguished, from, each, other, only, on, the, basis, of, tone, in, syllables, ending, with, the, checked, tone, is, excluded, in, spoken, burmese, some, linguists, classify, two, real, tones, there, are, four, nominal, tones, transcribed, in, written, burmese, high, applied, to, words, that, terminate, with, a, stop, or, check, high, rising, pitch, and, ordinary, unchecked, and, non, glottal, words, with, falling, or, lower, pitch, with, those, tones, encompassing, a, variety, of, pitches, the, ordinary, tone, consists, of, a, range, of, pitches, linguist, l, f, taylor, concluded, that, conversational, rhythm, and, euphonic, intonation, possess, importance, not, found, in, related, tonal, languages, and, that, its, tonal, system, is, now, in, an, advanced, state, of, decay, the, syllable, structure, of, burmese, is, c, g, v, v, c, which, is, to, say, the, onset, consists, of, a, consonant, optionally, followed, by, a, glide, and, the, rime, consists, of, a, monophthong, alone, a, monophthong, with, a, consonant, or, a, diphthong, with, a, consonant, the, only, consonants, that, can, stand, in, the, coda, are, and, some, representative, words, are, a, minor, syllable, has, some, restrictions, some, examples, of, words, containing, minor, syllables, the, burmese, alphabet, consists, of, 33, letters, and, 12, vowels, and, is, written, from, left, to, right, it, requires, no, spaces, between, words, although, modern, writing, usually, contains, spaces, after, each, clause, to, enhance, readability, characterized, by, its, circular, letters, and, diacritics, the, script, is, an, abugida, with, all, letters, having, an, inherent, vowel, a, or, the, consonants, are, arranged, into, six, consonant, groups, called, based, on, articulation, like, other, brahmi, scripts, tone, markings, and, vowel, modifications, are, written, as, diacritics, placed, to, the, left, right, top, and, bottom, of, letters, orthographic, changes, subsequent, to, shifts, in, phonology, such, as, the, merging, of, the, and, medials, rather, than, transformations, in, burmese, grammatical, structure, and, phonology, which, by, contrast, has, remained, stable, between, old, burmese, and, modern, burmese, for, example, during, the, pagan, era, the, medial, was, transcribed, in, writing, which, has, been, replaced, by, medials, and, in, modern, burmese, e, g, school, in, old, burmese, in, modern, burmese, likewise, written, burmese, has, preserved, all, nasalized, finals, which, have, merged, to, in, spoken, burmese, the, exception, is, which, in, spoken, burmese, can, be, one, of, many, open, vowels, similarly, other, consonantal, finals, have, been, reduced, to, similar, mergers, are, seen, in, other, sino, tibetan, languages, like, shanghainese, and, to, a, lesser, extent, cantonese, written, burmese, dates, to, the, early, pagan, period, burmese, orthography, originally, followed, a, square, block, format, but, the, cursive, format, took, hold, from, the, 17th, century, when, increased, literacy, and, the, resulting, explosion, of, burmese, literature, led, to, the, wider, use, of, palm, leaves, and, folded, paper, known, as, parabaiks, the, basic, word, order, of, the, burmese, language, is, subject, object, verb, pronouns, in, burmese, vary, according, to, the, gender, and, status, of, the, audience, although, pronouns, are, often, omitted, affixes, are, used, to, convey, information, verbs, are, almost, always, suffixed, and, nouns, declined, burmese, is, an, agglutinative, language, with, an, extensive, case, system, in, which, nouns, are, suffixed, to, determine, their, syntactic, function, in, a, sentence, or, clause, sometimes, the, case, markers, are, different, between, the, two, registers, the, case, markers, are, burmese, does, not, have, adjectives, per, se, rather, it, has, verbs, that, carry, the, meaning, to, be, x, where, x, is, an, english, adjective, these, verbs, can, modify, a, noun, by, means, of, the, suffix, tai, in, colloquial, burmese, literary, form, sau, which, is, suffixed, as, follows, adjectives, may, also, form, a, compound, with, the, noun, e, g, lu, hkyau, person, be, beautiful, comparatives, are, usually, ordered, x, htak, pui, adjective, where, x, is, the, object, being, compared, to, superlatives, are, indicated, with, the, prefix, a, adjective, hcum, the, roots, of, burmese, verbs, almost, always, have, affixes, which, convey, information, like, tense, aspect, intention, politeness, mood, etc, many, of, these, affixes, also, have, formal, literary, and, colloquial, equivalents, in, fact, the, only, time, in, which, no, suffix, is, attached, to, a, verb, is, in, imperative, commands, the, most, commonly, used, verb, affixes, and, their, usage, are, shown, below, with, an, example, verb, root, ca, to, eat, alone, the, statement, is, imperative, the, affix, tai, literary, form, sany, can, be, viewed, as, an, affix, marking, the, present, tense, and, or, a, factual, statement, ca, ca, tai, i, eat, the, affix, hkai, denotes, that, the, action, took, place, in, the, past, however, this, affix, is, not, always, necessary, to, indicate, the, past, tense, such, that, it, can, convey, the, same, information, without, it, but, to, emphasize, that, the, action, happened, before, another, event, that, is, also, currently, being, discussed, the, affix, becomes, imperative, the, affix, tai, in, this, case, denotes, a, factual, statement, rather, than, the, present, tense, ca, ca, hkai, tai, i, ate, the, affix, ne, is, used, to, denote, an, action, in, progression, it, is, equivalent, to, the, english, ing, ca, ca, ne, tai, i, am, eating, this, affix, pri, which, is, used, when, an, action, that, had, been, expected, to, be, performed, by, the, subject, is, now, finally, being, performed, has, no, equivalent, in, english, so, in, the, above, example, if, someone, had, been, expecting, the, subject, to, eat, and, the, subject, has, finally, started, eating, the, affix, is, used, as, follows, ca, ca, ca, pri, i, am, eating, the, affix, mai, literary, form, many, is, used, to, indicate, the, future, tense, or, an, action, which, is, yet, to, be, performed, ca, ca, mai, i, will, eat, the, affix, tau, is, used, when, the, action, is, about, to, be, performed, immediately, when, used, in, conjunction, with, therefore, it, could, be, termed, as, the, immediate, future, tense, suffix, ca, ca, tau, mai, i, m, going, to, eat, when, is, used, alone, however, it, is, imperative, ca, ca, tau, eat, verbs, are, negated, by, the, prefix, ma, generally, speaking, there, are, other, suffixes, on, verb, along, with, the, verb, suffix, nai, literary, form, hnang, indicates, a, command, ma, ca, ma, ca, nai, don, t, eat, the, verb, suffix, bhu, indicates, a, statement, ma, ca, ma, ca, bhu, don, t, eat, nouns, in, burmese, are, pluralized, by, suffixing, twe, or, if, the, word, ends, in, a, glottal, stop, in, colloquial, burmese, or, mya, in, formal, burmese, the, suffix, tou, which, indicates, a, group, of, persons, or, things, is, also, suffixed, to, the, modified, noun, an, example, is, below, plural, suffixes, are, not, used, when, the, noun, is, quantified, with, a, number, hka, le, k, l, child, nga, five, yauk, ja, cl, hka, le, nga, yauk, k, l, ja, child, five, cl, five, children, although, burmese, does, not, have, grammatical, gender, e, g, masculine, or, feminine, nouns, a, distinction, is, made, between, the, sexes, especially, in, animals, and, plants, by, means, of, suffix, particles, nouns, are, masculinized, with, the, following, suffixes, hti, hpa, or, hpui, depending, on, the, noun, and, feminized, with, the, suffix, ma, examples, of, usage, are, below, like, its, neighboring, languages, such, as, thai, bengali, and, chinese, burmese, uses, numerical, classifiers, also, called, measure, words, when, nouns, are, counted, or, quantified, this, approximately, equates, to, english, expressions, such, as, two, slices, of, bread, or, a, cup, of, coffee, classifiers, are, required, when, counting, nouns, so, hka, le, nga, lit, child, five, is, incorrect, since, the, measure, word, for, people, yauk, is, missing, it, needs, to, suffix, the, numeral, the, standard, word, order, of, quantified, words, is, quantified, noun, numeral, adjective, classifier, except, in, round, numbers, numbers, that, end, in, zero, in, which, the, word, order, is, flipped, where, the, quantified, noun, precedes, the, classifier, quantified, noun, classifier, numeral, adjective, the, only, exception, to, this, rule, is, the, number, 10, which, follows, the, standard, word, order, measurements, of, time, such, as, hour, day, or, month, do, not, require, classifiers, below, are, some, of, the, most, commonly, used, classifiers, in, burmese, the, burmese, language, makes, prominent, usage, of, affixes, called, in, burmese, which, are, untranslatable, words, that, are, suffixed, or, prefixed, to, words, to, indicate, tense, aspect, case, formality, etc, for, example, is, a, suffix, used, to, indicate, the, imperative, mood, while, work, suffix, indicating, politeness, does, not, indicate, the, imperative, work, suffix, indicating, imperative, mood, suffix, indicating, politeness, does, affixes, are, often, stacked, next, to, each, other, some, affixes, modify, the, word, s, part, of, speech, among, the, most, prominent, of, these, is, the, prefix, which, is, prefixed, to, verbs, and, adjectives, to, form, nouns, or, adverbs, for, instance, the, word, means, to, enter, but, combined, with, it, means, entrance, moreover, in, colloquial, burmese, there, is, a, tendency, to, omit, the, second, in, words, that, follow, the, pattern, noun, adverb, noun, adverb, like, which, is, pronounced, and, formally, pronounced, subject, pronouns, begin, sentences, though, the, subject, is, generally, omitted, in, the, imperative, forms, and, in, conversation, grammatically, speaking, subject, markers, in, colloquial, in, formal, must, be, attached, to, the, subject, pronoun, although, they, are, also, generally, omitted, in, conversation, object, pronouns, must, have, an, object, marker, in, colloquial, in, formal, attached, immediately, after, the, pronoun, proper, nouns, are, often, substituted, for, pronouns, one, s, status, in, relation, to, the, audience, determines, the, pronouns, used, with, certain, pronouns, used, for, different, audiences, polite, pronouns, are, used, to, address, elders, teachers, and, strangers, through, the, use, of, feudal, era, third, person, pronouns, in, lieu, of, first, and, second, person, pronouns, in, such, situations, one, refers, to, oneself, in, third, person, kya, nau, for, men, and, kya, ma, for, women, both, meaning, your, servant, and, refer, to, the, addressee, as, min, your, highness, khang, bya, master, lord, from, burmese, lord, master, or, hrang, ruler, master, so, ingrained, are, these, terms, in, the, daily, polite, speech, that, people, use, them, as, the, first, and, second, person, pronouns, without, giving, a, second, thought, to, the, root, meaning, of, these, pronouns, when, speaking, to, a, person, of, the, same, status, or, of, younger, age, nga, i, me, and, nang, you, may, be, used, although, most, speakers, choose, to, use, third, person, pronouns, for, example, an, older, person, may, use, dau, le, aunt, or, u, lei, uncle, to, refer, to, himself, while, a, younger, person, may, use, either, sa, son, or, sa, mi, daughter, the, basic, pronouns, are, other, pronouns, are, reserved, for, speaking, with, bhikkhus, buddhist, monks, when, speaking, to, a, bhikkhu, pronouns, like, bhun, bhun, from, phun, kri, monk, chara, dau, royal, teacher, and, a, hrang, bhu, ra, your, lordship, are, used, depending, on, their, status, when, referring, to, oneself, terms, like, ta, paey, tau, royal, disciple, or, da, ka, donor, are, used, when, speaking, to, a, monk, the, following, pronouns, are, used, in, colloquial, burmese, possessive, pronouns, are, contracted, when, the, root, pronoun, itself, is, low, toned, this, does, not, occur, in, literary, burmese, which, uses, as, postpositional, marker, for, possessive, case, instead, of, examples, include, the, following, the, contraction, also, occurs, in, some, low, toned, nouns, making, them, possessive, nouns, e, g, or, mother, s, and, myanmar, s, respectively, minor, pronunciation, differences, do, exist, within, regions, of, irrawaddy, valley, for, example, the, pronunciation, of, food, offering, is, preferred, in, lower, burma, instead, of, which, is, preferred, in, upper, burma, however, the, most, obvious, difference, between, upper, burmese, and, lower, burmese, is, that, upper, burmese, speech, still, differentiates, maternal, and, paternal, sides, of, a, family, 1, the, youngest, paternal, or, maternal, aunt, may, be, called, and, the, youngest, paternal, uncle, in, a, testament, to, the, power, of, media, the, yangon, based, speech, is, gaining, currency, even, in, upper, burma, upper, burmese, specific, usage, while, historically, and, technically, accurate, is, increasingly, viewed, as, distinctly, rural, or, regional, speech, in, fact, some, usages, are, already, considered, strictly, regional, upper, burmese, speech, and, are, likely, to, die, out, for, example, in, general, the, male, centric, names, of, old, burmese, for, familial, terms, have, been, replaced, in, standard, burmese, with, formerly, female, centric, terms, which, are, now, used, by, both, sexes, one, holdover, is, the, use, of, younger, brother, to, a, male, and, younger, brother, to, a, female, terms, like, elder, brother, to, a, male, and, younger, sister, to, a, male, now, are, used, in, standard, burmese, only, as, part, of, compound, words, like, brothers, or, brother, and, sister, reduplication, is, prevalent, in, burmese, and, is, used, to, intensify, or, weaken, adjectives, meanings, for, example, if, beautiful, is, reduplicated, then, the, intensity, of, the, adjective, s, meaning, increases, many, burmese, words, especially, adjectives, with, two, syllables, such, as, beautiful, when, reduplicated, become, adverbs, this, is, also, true, of, some, burmese, verbs, and, nouns, e, g, a, moment, frequently, which, become, adverbs, when, reduplicated, some, nouns, are, also, reduplicated, to, indicate, plurality, for, instance, country, but, when, reduplicated, to, it, means, many, countries, as, in, international, another, example, is, which, means, a, kind, but, the, reduplicated, form, means, multiple, kinds, a, few, measure, words, can, also, be, reduplicated, to, indicate, one, or, the, other, burmese, digits, are, traditionally, written, using, a, set, of, numerals, unique, to, the, mon, burmese, script, although, arabic, numerals, are, also, used, in, informal, contexts, the, cardinal, forms, of, burmese, numerals, are, primarily, inherited, from, the, proto, sino, tibetan, language, with, cognates, with, modern, day, sino, tibetan, languages, including, the, chinese, and, tibetan, numerals, beyond, ten, million, are, borrowed, from, indic, languages, like, sanskrit, or, pali, similarly, the, ordinal, forms, of, primary, burmese, numerals, i, e, from, first, to, tenth, are, borrowed, from, pali, the, liturgical, language, of, theravada, buddhism, ordinal, numbers, beyond, ten, are, suffixed, lit, to, raise, burmese, numerals, follow, the, nouns, they, modify, with, the, exception, of, round, numbers, which, precede, the, nouns, they, modify, moreover, numerals, are, subject, to, several, tone, sandhi, and, voicing, rules, that, involve, tone, changes, low, tone, creaky, tone, and, voicing, shifts, depending, on, the, pronunciation, of, surrounding, words, a, more, thorough, explanation, is, found, on, burmese, numerals, there, is, no, official, romanization, system, for, burmese, there, have, been, attempts, to, make, one, but, none, have, been, successful, replicating, burmese, sounds, in, the, latin, script, is, complicated, there, is, a, pali, based, transcription, system, in, existence, mlc, transcription, system, which, was, devised, by, the, myanmar, language, commission, mlc, however, it, only, transcribes, sounds, in, formal, burmese, and, is, based, on, the, burmese, alphabet, rather, than, the, phonology, several, colloquial, transcription, systems, have, been, proposed, but, none, is, overwhelmingly, preferred, over, others, transcription, of, burmese, is, not, standardized, as, seen, in, the, varying, english, transcriptions, of, burmese, names, for, instance, a, burmese, personal, name, like, may, be, variously, romanized, as, win, winn, wyn, or, wynn, while, may, be, romanized, as, khaing, khine, or, khain, the, burmese, alphabet, can, be, entered, from, a, standard, qwerty, keyboard, and, is, supported, within, the, unicode, standard, meaning, it, can, be, read, and, written, from, most, modern, computers, and, smartphones, burmese, has, complex, character, rendering, requirements, where, tone, markings, and, vowel, modifications, are, noted, using, diacritics, these, can, be, placed, before, consonants, as, with, above, them, as, with, or, even, around, them, as, with, these, character, clusters, are, built, using, multiple, keystrokes, in, particular, the, inconsistent, placement, of, diacritics, as, a, feature, of, the, language, presents, a, conflict, between, an, intuitive, wysiwyg, typing, approach, and, a, logical, consonant, first, storage, approach, since, its, introduction, in, 2007, the, most, popular, burmese, font, zawgyi, has, been, near, ubiquitous, in, myanmar, linguist, justin, watkins, argues, that, the, ubiquitous, use, of, zawgyi, harms, myanmar, languages, including, burmese, by, preventing, efficient, sorting, searching, processing, and, analyzing, myanmar, text, through, flexible, diacritic, ordering, zawgyi, is, not, unicode, compliant, but, occupies, the, same, code, space, as, unicode, myanmar, font, as, it, is, not, defined, as, a, standard, character, encoding, zawgyi, is, not, built, in, to, any, major, operating, systems, as, standard, however, allow, for, its, position, as, the, de, facto, but, largely, undocumented, standard, within, the, country, telcos, and, major, smartphone, distributors, such, as, huawei, and, samsung, ship, phones, with, zawgyi, font, overwriting, standard, unicode, compliant, fonts, which, are, installed, on, most, internationally, distributed, hardware, facebook, also, supports, zawgyi, as, an, additional, language, encoding, for, their, app, and, website, as, a, result, almost, all, sms, alerts, including, those, from, telcos, to, their, customers, social, media, posts, and, other, web, resources, may, be, incomprehensible, on, these, devices, without, the, custom, zawgyi, font, installed, at, the, operating, system, level, these, may, include, devices, purchased, overseas, or, distributed, by, companies, who, do, not, customize, software, for, the, local, market, keyboards, which, have, a, zawgyi, keyboard, layout, printed, on, them, are, the, most, commonly, available, for, purchase, domestically, until, recently, unicode, compliant, fonts, have, been, more, difficult, to, type, than, zawgyi, as, they, have, a, stricter, less, forgiving, and, arguably, less, intuitive, method, for, ordering, diacritics, however, intelligent, input, software, such, as, keymagic, and, recent, versions, of, smartphone, soft, keyboards, including, gboard, and, ttkeyboard, allow, for, more, forgiving, input, sequences, and, zawgyi, keyboard, layouts, which, produce, unicode, compliant, text, a, number, of, unicode, compliant, burmese, fonts, exist, the, national, standard, keyboard, layout, is, known, as, the, myanmar3, layout, and, it, was, published, along, with, the, myanmar3, unicode, font, the, layout, developed, by, the, myanmar, unicode, and, nlp, research, center, has, a, smart, input, system, to, cover, the, complex, structures, of, burmese, and, related, scripts, in, addition, to, the, development, of, computer, fonts, and, standard, keyboard, layout, there, is, still, a, lot, of, scope, of, research, for, the, burmese, language, specifically, for, natural, language, processing, nlp, areas, like, wordnet, search, engine, development, of, parallel, corpus, for, burmese, language, as, well, as, development, of, a, formally, standardized, and, dense, domain, specific, corpus, of, burmese, language, the, myanmar, government, has, designated, 1, october, 2019, as, u, day, to, officially, switch, to, unicode, the, full, transition, is,
