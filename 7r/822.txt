pollution, is, the, introduction, of, contaminants, into, the, natural, environment, that, cause, adverse, change, pollution, can, take, the, form, of, any, substance, solid, liquid, or, gas, or, energy, such, as, radioactivity, heat, sound, or, light, pollutants, the, components, of, pollution, can, be, either, foreign, substances, energies, or, naturally, occurring, contaminants, although, environmental, pollution, can, be, caused, by, natural, events, the, word, pollution, generally, implies, that, the, contaminants, have, an, anthropogenic, source, that, is, a, source, created, by, human, activities, such, as, manufacturing, extractive, industries, poor, waste, management, transportation, or, agriculture, pollution, is, often, classed, as, point, source, coming, from, a, highly, concentrated, specific, site, such, as, a, factory, mine, construction, site, or, nonpoint, source, pollution, coming, from, a, widespread, distributed, sources, such, as, microplastics, or, agricultural, runoff, many, sources, of, pollution, were, unregulated, parts, of, industrialization, during, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, until, the, emergence, of, environmental, regulation, and, pollution, policy, in, the, later, half, of, the, 20th, century, sites, where, historically, polluting, industries, released, persistent, pollutants, may, have, legacy, pollution, long, after, the, source, of, the, pollution, is, stopped, major, forms, of, pollution, include, air, pollution, water, pollution, litter, noise, pollution, plastic, pollution, soil, contamination, radioactive, contamination, thermal, pollution, light, pollution, and, visual, pollution, pollution, has, widespread, consequences, on, human, and, environmental, health, having, systematic, impact, on, social, and, economic, systems, in, 2019, pollution, killed, approximately, nine, million, people, worldwide, about, one, in, six, deaths, that, year, about, three, quarters, of, these, deaths, were, caused, by, air, pollution, a, 2022, literature, review, found, that, levels, of, anthropogenic, chemical, pollution, have, exceeded, planetary, boundaries, and, now, threaten, entire, ecosystems, around, the, world, pollutants, frequently, have, outsized, impacts, on, vulnerable, populations, such, as, children, and, the, elderly, and, marginalized, communities, because, polluting, industries, and, toxic, waste, sites, tend, to, be, collocated, with, populations, with, less, economic, and, political, power, this, outsized, impact, is, a, core, reason, for, the, formation, of, the, environmental, justice, movement, and, continues, to, be, a, core, element, of, environmental, conflicts, particularly, in, the, global, south, because, of, the, impacts, of, these, chemicals, local, and, international, countries, policy, have, increasingly, sought, to, regulate, pollutants, resulting, in, increasing, air, and, water, quality, standards, alongside, regulation, of, specific, waste, streams, regional, and, national, policy, is, typically, supervised, by, environmental, agencies, or, ministries, while, international, efforts, are, coordinated, by, the, un, environmental, program, and, other, treaty, bodies, pollution, mitigation, is, an, important, part, of, all, of, the, sustainable, development, goals, various, definitions, of, pollution, exist, which, may, or, may, not, recognize, certain, types, such, as, noise, pollution, or, greenhouse, gases, the, united, states, environmental, protection, administration, defines, pollution, as, any, substances, in, water, soil, or, air, that, degrade, the, natural, quality, of, the, environment, offend, the, senses, of, sight, taste, or, smell, or, cause, a, health, hazard, the, usefulness, of, the, natural, resource, is, usually, impaired, by, the, presence, of, pollutants, and, contaminants, in, contrast, the, united, nations, considers, pollution, to, be, the, presence, of, substances, and, heat, in, environmental, media, air, water, land, whose, nature, location, or, quantity, produces, undesirable, environmental, effects, the, major, forms, of, pollution, are, listed, below, along, with, the, particular, contaminants, relevant, to, each, of, them, one, of, the, most, significant, natural, sources, of, pollution, are, volcanoes, which, during, eruptions, release, large, quantities, of, harmful, gases, into, the, atmosphere, volcanic, gases, include, carbon, dioxide, which, can, be, fatal, in, large, concentrations, and, contributes, to, climate, change, hydrogen, halides, which, can, cause, acid, rain, sulfur, dioxides, which, are, harmful, to, animals, and, damage, the, ozone, layer, and, hydrogen, sulfides, which, are, capable, of, killing, humans, at, concentrations, of, less, than, 1, part, per, thousand, volcanic, emissions, also, include, fine, and, ultrafine, particles, which, may, contain, toxic, chemicals, and, substances, such, as, arsenic, lead, and, mercury, wildfires, which, can, be, caused, naturally, by, lightning, strikes, are, also, a, significant, source, of, air, pollution, wildfire, smoke, contains, significant, quantities, of, both, carbon, dioxide, and, carbon, monoxide, which, can, cause, suffocation, large, quantities, of, fine, particulates, are, found, within, wildfire, smoke, as, well, which, pose, a, health, risk, to, animals, motor, vehicle, emissions, are, one, of, the, leading, causes, of, air, pollution, china, united, states, russia, india, mexico, and, japan, are, the, world, leaders, in, air, pollution, emissions, principal, stationary, pollution, sources, include, chemical, plants, coal, fired, power, plants, oil, refineries, petrochemical, plants, nuclear, waste, disposal, activity, incinerators, large, livestock, farms, dairy, cows, pigs, poultry, etc, pvc, factories, metals, production, factories, plastics, factories, and, other, heavy, industry, agricultural, air, pollution, comes, from, contemporary, practices, which, include, clear, felling, and, burning, of, natural, vegetation, as, well, as, spraying, of, pesticides, and, herbicides, about, 400, million, metric, tons, of, hazardous, wastes, are, generated, each, year, the, united, states, alone, produces, about, 250, million, metric, tons, americans, constitute, less, than, 5, of, the, world, s, population, but, produce, roughly, 25, of, the, world, s, co, 2, and, generate, approximately, 30, of, world, s, waste, in, 2007, china, overtook, the, united, states, as, the, world, s, biggest, producer, of, co, 2, while, still, far, behind, based, on, per, capita, pollution, ranked, 78th, among, the, world, s, nations, chlorinated, hydrocarbons, cfh, heavy, metals, such, as, chromium, cadmium, found, in, rechargeable, batteries, and, lead, found, in, lead, paint, aviation, fuel, and, even, in, certain, countries, gasoline, mtbe, zinc, arsenic, and, benzene, are, some, of, the, most, frequent, soil, contaminants, a, series, of, press, reports, published, in, 2001, culminating, in, the, publication, of, the, book, fateful, harvest, revealed, a, widespread, practise, of, recycling, industrial, leftovers, into, fertilizer, resulting, in, metal, poisoning, of, the, soil, ordinary, municipal, landfills, are, the, source, of, many, chemical, substances, entering, the, soil, environment, and, often, groundwater, emanating, from, the, wide, variety, of, refuse, accepted, especially, substances, illegally, discarded, there, or, from, pre, 1970, landfills, that, may, have, been, subject, to, little, control, in, the, u, s, or, eu, there, have, also, been, some, unusual, releases, of, polychlorinated, dibenzodioxins, commonly, called, dioxins, for, simplicity, such, as, tcdd, pollution, can, also, occur, as, a, result, of, natural, disasters, hurricanes, for, example, frequently, result, in, sewage, contamination, and, petrochemical, spills, from, burst, boats, or, automobiles, when, coastal, oil, rigs, or, refineries, are, involved, larger, scale, and, environmental, damage, is, not, unusual, when, accidents, occur, some, pollution, sources, such, as, nuclear, power, stations, or, oil, ships, can, create, extensive, and, potentially, catastrophic, emissions, plastic, pollution, is, choking, our, oceans, by, making, plastic, gyres, entangling, marine, animals, poisoning, our, food, and, water, supply, and, ultimately, inflicting, havoc, on, the, health, and, well, being, of, humans, and, wildlife, globally, with, the, exception, of, a, small, amount, that, has, been, incinerating, virtually, every, piece, of, plastic, that, was, ever, made, in, the, past, still, exists, in, one, form, or, another, and, since, most, of, the, plastics, do, not, biodegrade, in, any, meaningful, sense, all, that, plastic, waste, could, exist, for, hundreds, or, even, thousands, of, years, if, plastic, production, is, not, circumscribed, plastic, pollution, will, be, disastrous, and, will, eventually, outweigh, fish, in, oceans, carbon, dioxide, while, vital, for, photosynthesis, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, pollution, because, raised, levels, of, the, gas, in, the, atmosphere, are, affecting, the, earth, s, climate, disruption, of, the, environment, can, also, highlight, the, connection, between, areas, of, pollution, that, would, normally, be, classified, separately, such, as, those, of, water, and, air, recent, studies, have, investigated, the, potential, for, long, term, rising, levels, of, atmospheric, carbon, dioxide, to, cause, slight, but, critical, increases, in, the, acidity, of, ocean, waters, and, the, possible, effects, of, this, on, marine, ecosystems, in, february, 2007, a, report, by, the, intergovernmental, panel, on, climate, change, ipcc, representing, the, work, of, 2, 500, scientists, economists, and, policymakers, from, more, than, 120, countries, confirmed, that, humans, have, been, the, primary, cause, of, global, warming, since, 1950, humans, have, ways, to, cut, greenhouse, gas, emissions, and, avoid, the, consequences, of, global, warming, a, major, climate, report, concluded, but, to, change, the, climate, the, transition, from, fossil, fuels, like, coal, and, oil, needs, to, occur, within, decades, according, to, the, final, report, this, year, from, the, un, s, intergovernmental, panel, on, climate, change, ipcc, pollution, affects, humans, in, every, part, of, the, world, an, october, 2017, study, by, the, lancet, commission, on, pollution, and, health, found, that, global, pollution, specifically, toxic, air, water, soil, and, workplaces, kills, nine, million, people, annually, which, is, triple, the, number, of, deaths, caused, by, aids, tuberculosis, and, malaria, combined, and, 15, times, higher, than, deaths, caused, by, wars, and, other, forms, of, human, violence, the, study, concluded, that, pollution, is, one, of, the, great, existential, challenges, of, the, anthropocene, era, pollution, endangers, the, stability, of, the, earth, s, support, systems, and, threatens, the, continuing, survival, of, human, societies, adverse, air, quality, can, kill, many, organisms, including, humans, ozone, pollution, can, cause, respiratory, disease, cardiovascular, disease, throat, inflammation, chest, pain, and, congestion, a, 2010, analysis, estimated, that, 1, 2, million, people, died, prematurely, each, year, in, china, alone, because, of, air, pollution, china, s, high, smog, levels, can, damage, the, human, body, and, cause, various, diseases, in, 2019, air, pollution, caused, 1, 67, million, deaths, in, india, 17, 8, of, total, deaths, nationally, studies, have, estimated, that, the, number, of, people, killed, annually, in, the, united, states, could, be, over, 50, 000, a, study, published, in, 2022, in, geohealth, concluded, that, energy, related, fossil, fuel, emissions, in, the, united, states, cause, 46, 900, 59, 400, premature, deaths, each, year, and, pm2, 5, related, illness, and, death, costs, the, nation, 537, 678, billion, annually, in, the, us, deaths, caused, by, coal, pollution, were, highest, in, 1999, but, decreased, sharply, after, 2007, the, number, dropped, by, about, 95, by, 2020, as, coal, plants, have, been, closed, or, have, scrubbers, installed, in, 2019, water, pollution, caused, 1, 4, million, premature, deaths, contamination, of, drinking, water, by, untreated, sewage, in, developing, countries, is, an, issue, for, example, over, 732, million, indians, 56, of, the, population, and, over, 92, million, ethiopians, 92, 9, of, the, population, do, not, have, access, to, basic, sanitation, in, 2013, over, 10, million, people, in, india, fell, ill, with, waterborne, illnesses, in, 2013, and, 1, 535, people, died, most, of, them, children, as, of, 2007, nearly, 500, million, chinese, lack, access, to, safe, drinking, water, acute, exposure, to, certain, pollutants, can, have, short, and, long, term, effects, oil, spills, can, cause, skin, irritations, and, rashes, noise, pollution, induces, hearing, loss, high, blood, pressure, stress, and, sleep, disturbance, mercury, has, been, linked, to, developmental, deficits, in, children, and, neurologic, symptoms, older, people, are, significantly, exposed, to, diseases, induced, by, air, pollution, those, with, heart, or, lung, disorders, are, at, additional, risk, children, and, infants, are, also, at, serious, risk, lead, and, other, heavy, metals, have, been, shown, to, cause, neurological, problems, intellectual, disabilities, and, behavioural, problems, chemical, and, radioactive, substances, can, cause, cancer, and, birth, defects, the, health, impacts, of, pollution, have, both, direct, and, lasting, social, consequences, a, 2021, study, found, that, exposure, to, pollution, causes, an, increase, in, violent, crime, a, 2019, paper, linked, pollution, to, adverse, school, outcomes, for, children, a, number, of, studies, show, that, pollution, has, an, adverse, effect, on, the, productivity, of, both, indoor, and, outdoor, workers, pollution, has, been, found, to, be, present, widely, in, the, natural, environment, a, 2022, study, published, in, environmental, science, technology, found, that, levels, of, anthropogenic, chemical, pollution, have, exceeded, planetary, boundaries, and, now, threaten, entire, ecosystems, around, the, world, there, are, a, number, of, effects, of, this, to, protect, the, environment, from, the, adverse, effects, of, pollution, many, nations, worldwide, have, enacted, legislation, to, regulate, various, types, of, pollution, as, well, as, to, mitigate, the, adverse, effects, of, pollution, at, the, local, level, regulation, usually, is, supervised, by, environmental, agencies, or, the, broader, public, health, system, different, jurisdictions, often, have, different, levels, regulation, and, policy, choices, about, pollution, historically, polluters, will, lobby, governments, in, less, economically, developed, areas, or, countries, to, maintain, lax, regulation, in, order, to, protect, industrialisation, at, the, cost, of, human, and, environmental, health, the, modern, environmental, regulatory, environment, has, its, origins, in, the, united, states, with, the, beginning, of, industrial, regulations, around, air, and, water, pollution, connected, to, industry, and, mining, during, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, pollution, control, is, a, term, used, in, environmental, management, it, refers, to, the, control, of, emissions, and, effluents, into, air, water, or, soil, without, pollution, control, the, waste, products, from, overconsumption, heating, agriculture, mining, manufacturing, transportation, and, other, human, activities, whether, they, accumulate, or, disperse, will, degrade, the, environment, in, the, hierarchy, of, controls, pollution, prevention, and, waste, minimization, are, more, desirable, than, pollution, control, in, the, field, of, land, development, low, impact, development, is, a, similar, technique, for, the, prevention, of, urban, runoff, policy, law, and, monitoring, transparency, life, cycle, assessment, attached, economics, could, be, developed, and, enforced, to, control, pollution, a, review, concluded, that, there, is, a, lack, of, attention, and, action, such, as, work, on, a, globally, supported, formal, science, policy, interface, e, g, to, inform, intervention, influence, research, and, guide, funding, in, september, 2023, a, global, framework, on, chemicals, aiming, to, reduce, pollution, was, agreed, during, an, international, conference, in, bonn, germany, the, framework, includes, 28, targets, for, example, to, end, the, use, of, hazardous, pesticides, in, agriculture, where, the, risks, have, not, been, managed, by, 2035, pollution, has, a, cost, manufacturing, activities, that, cause, air, pollution, impose, health, and, clean, up, costs, on, the, whole, of, society, a, manufacturing, activity, that, causes, air, pollution, is, an, example, of, a, negative, externality, in, production, a, negative, externality, in, production, occurs, when, a, firm, s, production, reduces, the, well, being, of, others, who, are, not, compensated, by, the, firm, for, example, if, a, laundry, firm, exists, near, a, polluting, steel, manufacturing, firm, there, will, be, increased, costs, for, the, laundry, firm, because, of, the, dirt, and, smoke, produced, by, the, steel, manufacturing, firm, if, external, costs, exist, such, as, those, created, by, pollution, the, manufacturer, will, choose, to, produce, more, of, the, product, than, would, be, produced, if, the, manufacturer, were, required, to, pay, all, associated, environmental, costs, because, responsibility, or, consequence, for, self, directed, action, lies, partly, outside, the, self, an, element, of, externalization, is, involved, if, there, are, external, benefits, such, as, in, public, safety, less, of, the, good, may, be, produced, than, would, be, the, case, if, the, producer, were, to, receive, payment, for, the, external, benefits, to, others, goods, and, services, that, involve, negative, externalities, in, production, such, as, those, that, produce, pollution, tend, to, be, overproduced, and, underpriced, since, the, externality, is, not, being, priced, into, the, market, pollution, can, also, create, costs, for, the, firms, producing, the, pollution, sometimes, firms, choose, or, are, forced, by, regulation, to, reduce, the, amount, of, pollution, that, they, are, producing, the, associated, costs, of, doing, this, are, called, abatement, costs, or, marginal, abatement, costs, if, measured, by, each, additional, unit, in, 2005, pollution, abatement, capital, expenditures, and, operating, costs, in, the, us, amounted, to, nearly, 27, billion, the, pure, earth, an, international, non, for, profit, organization, dedicated, to, eliminating, life, threatening, pollution, in, the, developing, world, issues, an, annual, list, of, some, of, the, world, s, most, polluting, industries, below, is, the, list, for, 2016, a, 2018, report, by, the, institute, for, agriculture, and, trade, policy, and, grain, says, that, the, meat, and, dairy, industries, are, poised, to, surpass, the, oil, industry, as, the, world, s, worst, polluters, the, textile, industry, is, one, of, the, largest, polluters, in, the, globalized, world, of, mostly, free, market, dominated, socioeconomic, systems, chemically, polluted, textile, wastewater, degrades, the, quality, of, the, soil, and, water, the, pollution, comes, from, the, type, of, conduct, of, chemical, treatments, used, e, g, in, pretreatment, dyeing, printing, and, finishing, operations, that, many, or, most, market, driven, companies, use, despite, eco, friendly, alternatives, textile, industry, wastewater, is, considered, to, be, one, the, largest, polluters, of, water, and, soil, ecosystems, causing, carcinogenic, mutagenic, genotoxic, cytotoxic, and, allergenic, threats, to, living, organisms, the, textile, industry, uses, over, 8000, chemicals, in, its, supply, chain, also, polluting, the, environment, with, large, amounts, of, microplastics, and, has, been, identified, in, one, review, as, the, industry, sector, producing, the, largest, amount, of, pollution, a, campaign, of, big, clothing, brands, like, nike, adidas, and, puma, to, voluntarily, reform, their, manufacturing, supply, chains, to, commit, to, achieving, zero, discharges, of, hazardous, chemicals, by, 2020, global, goal, appears, to, have, failed, outdoor, air, pollution, attributable, to, fossil, fuel, use, alone, causes, 3, 61, million, deaths, annually, making, it, one, of, the, top, contributors, to, human, death, beyond, being, a, major, driver, of, climate, change, whereby, greenhouse, gases, are, considered, per, se, as, a, form, of, pollution, see, above, society, derives, some, indirect, utility, from, pollution, otherwise, there, would, be, no, incentive, to, pollute, this, utility, may, come, from, the, consumption, of, goods, and, services, that, inherently, create, pollution, albeit, the, level, can, vary, or, lower, prices, or, lower, required, efforts, or, inconvenience, to, abandon, or, substitute, these, goods, and, services, therefore, it, is, important, that, policymakers, attempt, to, balance, these, indirect, benefits, with, the, costs, of, pollution, in, order, to, achieve, an, efficient, outcome, it, is, possible, to, use, environmental, economics, to, determine, which, level, of, pollution, is, deemed, the, social, optimum, for, economists, pollution, is, an, external, cost, and, occurs, only, when, one, or, more, individuals, suffer, a, loss, of, welfare, there, is, a, socially, optimal, level, of, pollution, at, which, welfare, is, maximized, this, is, because, consumers, derive, utility, from, the, good, or, service, manufactured, which, will, outweigh, the, social, cost, of, pollution, until, a, certain, point, at, this, point, the, damage, of, one, extra, unit, of, pollution, to, society, the, marginal, cost, of, pollution, is, exactly, equal, to, the, marginal, benefit, of, consuming, one, more, unit, of, the, good, or, service, moreover, the, feasibility, of, pollution, reduction, rates, could, also, be, a, factor, of, calculating, optimal, levels, while, a, study, puts, the, global, mean, loss, of, life, expectancy, lle, similar, to, ypll, from, air, pollution, in, 2015, at, 2, 9, years, substantially, more, than, for, example, 0, 3, years, from, all, forms, of, direct, violence, it, also, indicated, that, a, significant, fraction, of, the, lle, is, unavoidable, in, terms, of, current, economical, technological, feasibility, such, as, aeolian, dust, and, wildfire, emission, control, in, markets, with, pollution, or, other, negative, externalities, in, production, the, free, market, equilibrium, will, not, account, for, the, costs, of, pollution, on, society, if, the, social, costs, of, pollution, are, higher, than, the, private, costs, incurred, by, the, firm, then, the, true, supply, curve, will, be, higher, the, point, at, which, the, social, marginal, cost, and, market, demand, intersect, gives, the, socially, optimal, level, of, pollution, at, this, point, the, quantity, will, be, lower, and, the, price, will, be, higher, in, comparison, to, the, free, market, equilibrium, therefore, the, free, market, outcome, could, be, considered, a, market, failure, because, it, does, not, maximize, efficiency, this, model, can, be, used, as, a, basis, to, evaluate, different, methods, of, internalizing, the, externality, such, as, tariffs, a, pigouvian, tax, such, as, a, carbon, tax, and, cap, and, trade, systems, air, pollution, has, always, accompanied, civilizations, pollution, started, from, prehistoric, times, when, man, created, the, first, fires, according, to, a, 1983, article, in, the, journal, science, soot, found, on, ceilings, of, prehistoric, caves, provides, ample, evidence, of, the, high, levels, of, pollution, that, was, associated, with, inadequate, ventilation, of, open, fires, metal, forging, appears, to, be, a, key, turning, point, in, the, creation, of, significant, air, pollution, levels, outside, the, home, core, samples, of, glaciers, in, greenland, indicate, increases, in, pollution, associated, with, greek, roman, and, chinese, metal, production, the, burning, of, coal, and, wood, and, the, presence, of, many, horses, in, concentrated, areas, made, the, cities, the, primary, sources, of, pollution, king, edward, i, of, england, banned, the, burning, of, sea, coal, by, proclamation, in, london, in, 1272, after, its, smoke, became, a, problem, the, fuel, was, so, common, in, england, that, this, earliest, of, names, for, it, was, acquired, because, it, could, be, carted, away, from, some, shores, by, the, wheelbarrow, it, was, the, industrial, revolution, that, gave, birth, to, environmental, pollution, as, we, know, it, today, london, also, recorded, one, of, the, earlier, extreme, cases, of, water, quality, problems, with, the, great, stink, on, the, thames, of, 1858, which, led, to, construction, of, the, london, sewerage, system, soon, afterward, pollution, issues, escalated, as, population, growth, far, exceeded, viability, of, neighborhoods, to, handle, their, waste, problem, reformers, began, to, demand, sewer, systems, and, clean, water, in, 1870, the, sanitary, conditions, in, berlin, were, among, the, worst, in, europe, august, bebel, recalled, conditions, before, a, modern, sewer, system, was, built, in, the, late, 1870s, waste, water, from, the, houses, collected, in, the, gutters, running, alongside, the, curbs, and, emitted, a, truly, fearsome, smell, there, were, no, public, toilets, in, the, streets, or, squares, visitors, especially, women, often, became, desperate, when, nature, called, in, the, public, buildings, the, sanitary, facilities, were, unbelievably, primitive, as, a, metropolis, berlin, did, not, emerge, from, a, state, of, barbarism, into, civilization, until, after, 1870, the, primitive, conditions, were, intolerable, for, a, world, national, capital, and, the, imperial, german, government, brought, in, its, scientists, engineers, and, urban, planners, to, not, only, solve, the, deficiencies, but, to, forge, berlin, as, the, world, s, model, city, a, british, expert, in, 1906, concluded, that, berlin, represented, the, most, complete, application, of, science, order, and, method, of, public, life, adding, it, is, a, marvel, of, civic, administration, the, most, modern, and, most, perfectly, organized, city, that, there, is, the, emergence, of, great, factories, and, consumption, of, immense, quantities, of, coal, gave, rise, to, unprecedented, air, pollution, and, the, large, volume, of, industrial, chemical, discharges, added, to, the, growing, load, of, untreated, human, waste, chicago, and, cincinnati, were, the, first, two, american, cities, to, enact, laws, ensuring, cleaner, air, in, 1881, pollution, became, a, major, issue, in, the, united, states, in, the, early, twentieth, century, as, progressive, reformers, took, issue, with, air, pollution, caused, by, coal, burning, water, pollution, caused, by, bad, sanitation, and, street, pollution, caused, by, the, three, million, horses, who, worked, in, american, cities, in, 1900, generating, large, quantities, of, urine, and, manure, as, historian, martin, melosi, notes, the, generation, that, first,

the, country, until, early, in, the, 20th, century, when, the, short, lived, office, of, air, pollution, was, created, under, the, department, of, the, interior, extreme, smog, events, were, experienced, by, the, cities, of, los, angeles, and, donora, pennsylvania, in, the, late, 1940s, serving, as, another, public, reminder, air, pollution, would, continue, to, be, a, problem, in, england, especially, later, during, the, industrial, revolution, and, extending, into, the, recent, past, with, the, great, smog, of, 1952, awareness, of, atmospheric, pollution, spread, widely, after, world, war, ii, with, fears, triggered, by, reports, of, radioactive, fallout, from, atomic, warfare, and, testing, then, a, non, nuclear, event, the, great, smog, of, 1952, in, london, killed, at, least, 4000, people, this, prompted, some, of, the, first, major, modern, environmental, legislation, the, clean, air, act, of, 1956, pollution, began, to, draw, major, public, attention, in, the, united, states, between, the, mid, 1950s, and, early, 1970s, when, congress, passed, the, noise, control, act, the, clean, air, act, the, clean, water, act, and, the, national, environmental, policy, act, severe, incidents, of, pollution, helped, increase, consciousness, pcb, dumping, in, the, hudson, river, resulted, in, a, ban, by, the, epa, on, consumption, of, its, fish, in, 1974, national, news, stories, in, the, late, 1970s, especially, the, long, term, dioxin, contamination, at, love, canal, starting, in, 1947, and, uncontrolled, dumping, in, valley, of, the, drums, led, to, the, superfund, legislation, of, 1980, the, pollution, of, industrial, land, gave, rise, to, the, name, brownfield, a, term, now, common, in, city, planning, the, development, of, nuclear, science, introduced, radioactive, contamination, which, can, remain, lethally, radioactive, for, hundreds, of, thousands, of, years, lake, karachay, named, by, the, worldwatch, institute, as, the, most, polluted, spot, on, earth, served, as, a, disposal, site, for, the, soviet, union, throughout, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, chelyabinsk, russia, is, considered, the, most, polluted, place, on, the, planet, nuclear, weapons, continued, to, be, tested, in, the, cold, war, especially, in, the, earlier, stages, of, their, development, the, toll, on, the, worst, affected, populations, and, the, growth, since, then, in, understanding, about, the, critical, threat, to, human, health, posed, by, radioactivity, has, also, been, a, prohibitive, complication, associated, with, nuclear, power, though, extreme, care, is, practiced, in, that, industry, the, potential, for, disaster, suggested, by, incidents, such, as, those, at, three, mile, island, chernobyl, and, fukushima, pose, a, lingering, specter, of, public, mistrust, worldwide, publicity, has, been, intense, on, those, disasters, widespread, support, for, test, ban, treaties, has, ended, almost, all, nuclear, testing, in, the, atmosphere, international, catastrophes, such, as, the, wreck, of, the, amoco, cadiz, oil, tanker, off, the, coast, of, brittany, in, 1978, and, the, bhopal, disaster, in, 1984, have, demonstrated, the, universality, of, such, events, and, the, scale, on, which, efforts, to, address, them, needed, to, engage, the, borderless, nature, of, atmosphere, and, oceans, inevitably, resulted, in, the, implication, of, pollution, on, a, planetary, level, with, the, issue, of, global, warming, most, recently, the, term, persistent, organic, pollutant, pop, has, come, to, describe, a, group, of, chemicals, such, as, pbdes, and, pfcs, among, others, though, their, effects, remain, somewhat, less, well, understood, owing, to, a, lack, of, experimental, data, they, have, been, detected, in, various, ecological, habitats, far, removed, from, industrial, activity, such, as, the, arctic, demonstrating, diffusion, and, bioaccumulation, after, only, a, relatively, brief, period, of,

contaminating, also, large, territories, far, away, from, towns, growing, evidence, of, local, and, global, pollution, and, an, increasingly, informed, public, over, time, have, given, rise, to, environmentalism, and, the, environmental, movement, which, generally, seek, to, limit, human, impact, on, the, environment, air, pollution, soil, contamination, water, pollution, other
