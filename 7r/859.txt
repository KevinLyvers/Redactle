and, ancient, greek, logia, from, logos, meaning, word, reason, is, the, interdisciplinary, study, of, crime, and, deviant, behaviour, criminology, is, a, multidisciplinary, field, in, both, the, behavioural, and, social, sciences, which, draws, primarily, upon, the, research, of, sociologists, political, scientists, economists, legal, sociologists, psychologists, philosophers, psychiatrists, social, workers, biologists, social, anthropologists, scholars, of, law, and, jurisprudence, as, well, as, the, processes, that, define, administration, of, justice, and, the, criminal, justice, system, criminologists, are, individuals, who, engage, in, the, exploration, and, investigation, of, the, intersection, between, crime, and, society, s, reactions, to, it, certain, criminologists, delve, into, the, behavioral, trends, of, potential, offenders, in, a, broader, sense, these, professionals, undertake, research, and, inquiries, formulating, hypotheses, and, scrutinizing, observable, trends, in, a, systematic, manner, the, interests, of, criminologists, include, the, study, of, nature, of, crime, and, criminals, origins, of, criminal, law, etiology, of, crime, social, reaction, to, crime, and, the, functioning, of, law, enforcement, agencies, and, the, penal, institutions, it, can, be, broadly, said, that, criminology, directs, its, inquiries, along, three, lines, first, it, investigates, the, nature, of, criminal, law, and, its, administration, and, conditions, under, which, it, develops, second, it, analyzes, the, causation, of, crime, and, the, personality, of, criminals, and, third, it, studies, the, control, of, crime, and, the, rehabilitation, of, offenders, thus, criminology, includes, within, its, scope, the, activities, of, legislative, bodies, law, enforcement, agencies, judicial, institutions, correctional, institutions, and, educational, private, and, public, social, agencies, modern, academic, criminology, has, direct, roots, in, the, 19th, century, italian, school, of, criminal, anthropology, which, according, to, the, historian, mary, gibson, caused, a, radical, refocusing, of, criminological, discussion, throughout, europe, and, the, united, states, from, law, to, the, criminal, while, this, italian, school, was, in, turn, attacked, and, partially, supplanted, in, countries, such, as, france, by, sociological, theories, of, delinquency, they, retained, the, new, focus, on, the, criminal, according, to, gibson, the, term, criminology, was, most, likely, coined, in, 1885, by, italian, law, professor, raffaele, garofalo, as, criminologia, in, the, late, 19th, century, french, anthropologist, paul, topinard, used, the, analogous, french, term, criminologie, criminology, grew, substantially, as, a, discipline, in, the, first, quarter, of, the, twentieth, century, from, 1900, through, to, 2000, this, field, of, research, underwent, three, significant, phases, in, the, united, states, 1, golden, age, of, research, 1900, 1930, which, has, been, described, as, a, multiple, factor, approach, 2, golden, age, of, theory, 1930, 1960, which, endeavored, to, show, the, limits, of, systematically, connecting, criminological, research, to, theory, and, 3, a, 1960, 2000, period, which, was, seen, as, a, significant, turning, point, for, criminology, there, were, three, main, schools, of, thought, in, early, criminological, theory, spanning, the, period, from, the, mid, 18th, century, to, the, mid, twentieth, century, classical, positivist, and, chicago, these, schools, of, thought, were, superseded, by, several, contemporary, paradigms, of, criminology, such, as, the, sub, culture, control, strain, labelling, critical, criminology, cultural, criminology, postmodern, criminology, feminist, criminology, queer, criminology, and, others, discussed, below, the, classical, school, arose, in, the, mid, 18th, century, and, reflects, ideas, from, utilitarian, philosophy, cesare, beccaria, author, of, on, crimes, and, punishments, 1763, 64, jeremy, bentham, inventor, of, the, panopticon, and, other, early, criminological, philosophers, proposed, ideas, including, this, school, developed, during, a, major, reform, in, penology, when, society, began, designing, prisons, for, the, sake, of, extreme, punishment, this, period, also, saw, many, legal, reforms, the, french, revolution, and, the, development, of, the, legal, system, in, the, united, states, the, positivist, school, argues, criminal, behaviour, comes, from, internal, and, external, factors, out, of, the, individual, s, control, its, key, method, of, thought, is, that, criminals, are, born, as, criminals, and, not, made, into, them, this, school, of, thought, also, supports, theory, of, nature, in, the, debate, between, nature, versus, nurture, they, also, argue, that, criminal, behavior, is, innate, and, within, a, person, philosophers, within, this, school, applied, the, scientific, method, to, study, human, behavior, positivism, comprises, three, segments, biological, psychological, and, social, positivism, psychological, positivism, is, the, concept, that, criminal, acts, or, the, people, doing, said, crimes, do, them, because, of, internal, factors, driving, them, social, positivism, which, is, often, referred, to, as, sociological, positivism, discusses, the, thought, process, that, criminals, are, produced, by, society, this, school, claims, that, low, income, levels, high, poverty, unemployment, rates, and, poor, educational, systems, create, and, motivate, criminals, the, notion, of, having, a, criminal, personality, is, achieved, from, the, school, of, thought, of, psychological, positivism, it, essentially, means, that, parts, of, an, individual, s, personality, have, traits, that, align, with, many, of, those, possessed, by, criminals, such, as, neuroticism, anti, social, tendencies, aggressive, behaviors, and, other, factors, there, is, evidence, of, correlation, but, not, causation, between, these, personality, traits, and, criminal, actions, cesare, lombroso, 1835, 1909, an, italian, sociologist, working, in, the, late, 19th, century, is, often, called, the, father, of, criminology, he, was, one, of, the, key, contributors, to, biological, positivism, and, founded, the, italian, school, of, criminology, lombroso, took, a, scientific, approach, insisting, on, empirical, evidence, for, studying, crime, he, suggested, physiological, traits, such, as, the, measurements, of, cheekbones, or, hairline, or, a, cleft, palate, could, indicate, atavistic, criminal, tendencies, this, approach, whose, influence, came, via, the, theory, of, phrenology, and, by, charles, darwin, s, theory, of, evolution, has, been, superseded, enrico, ferri, a, student, of, lombroso, believed, social, as, well, as, biological, factors, played, a, role, and, believed, criminals, should, not, be, held, responsible, when, factors, causing, their, criminality, were, beyond, their, control, criminologists, have, since, rejected, lombroso, s, biological, theories, since, control, groups, were, not, used, in, his, studies, sociological, positivism, suggests, societal, factors, such, as, poverty, membership, of, subcultures, or, low, levels, of, education, can, predispose, people, to, crime, adolphe, quetelet, used, data, and, statistical, analysis, to, study, the, relationship, between, crime, and, sociological, factors, he, found, age, gender, poverty, education, and, alcohol, consumption, were, important, factors, to, crime, lance, lochner, performed, three, different, research, experiments, each, one, proving, education, reduces, crime, rawson, w, rawson, used, crime, statistics, to, suggest, a, link, between, population, density, and, crime, rates, with, crowded, cities, producing, more, crime, joseph, fletcher, and, john, glyde, read, papers, to, the, statistical, society, of, london, on, their, studies, of, crime, and, its, distribution, henry, mayhew, used, empirical, methods, and, an, ethnographic, approach, to, address, social, questions, and, poverty, and, gave, his, studies, in, london, labour, and, the, london, poor, mile, durkheim, viewed, crime, as, an, inevitable, aspect, of, a, society, with, uneven, distribution, of, wealth, and, other, differences, among, people, differential, association, sub, cultural, posits, that, people, learn, crime, through, association, this, theory, was, advocated, by, edwin, sutherland, who, focused, on, how, a, person, becomes, delinquent, because, of, an, excess, of, definitions, favorable, to, violation, of, law, over, definitions, unfavorable, to, violation, of, law, associating, with, people, who, may, condone, criminal, conduct, or, justify, crime, under, specific, circumstances, makes, one, more, likely, to, take, that, view, under, his, theory, interacting, with, this, type, of, antisocial, peer, is, a, major, cause, of, delinquency, reinforcing, criminal, behavior, makes, it, chronic, where, there, are, criminal, subcultures, many, individuals, learn, crime, and, crime, rates, swell, in, those, areas, the, chicago, school, arose, in, the, early, twentieth, century, through, the, work, of, robert, e, park, ernest, burgess, and, other, urban, sociologists, at, the, university, of, chicago, in, the, 1920s, park, and, burgess, identified, five, concentric, zones, that, often, exist, as, cities, grow, including, the, zone, of, transition, which, was, identified, as, the, most, volatile, and, subject, to, disorder, in, the, 1940s, henry, mckay, and, clifford, r, shaw, focused, on, juvenile, delinquents, finding, that, they, were, concentrated, in, the, zone, of, transition, the, chicago, school, was, a, school, of, thought, developed, that, blames, social, structures, for, human, behaviors, this, thought, can, be, associated, or, used, within, criminology, because, it, essentially, takes, the, stance, of, defending, criminals, and, criminal, behaviors, the, defense, and, argument, lies, in, the, thoughts, that, these, people, and, their, acts, are, not, their, faults, but, they, are, actually, the, result, of, society, i, e, unemployment, poverty, etc, and, these, people, are, actually, in, fact, behaving, properly, chicago, school, sociologists, adopted, a, social, ecology, approach, to, studying, cities, and, postulated, that, urban, neighborhoods, with, high, levels, of, poverty, often, experience, a, breakdown, in, the, social, structure, and, institutions, such, as, family, and, schools, this, results, in, social, disorganization, which, reduces, the, ability, of, these, institutions, to, control, behavior, and, creates, an, environment, ripe, for, deviant, behavior, other, researchers, suggested, an, added, social, psychological, link, edwin, sutherland, suggested, that, people, learn, criminal, behavior, from, older, more, experienced, criminals, with, whom, they, may, associate, theoretical, perspectives, used, in, criminology, include, psychoanalysis, functionalism, interactionism, marxism, econometrics, systems, theory, postmodernism, behavioural, genetics, personality, psychology, evolutionary, psychology, etc, this, theory, is, applied, to, a, variety, of, approaches, within, the, bases, of, criminology, in, particular, and, in, sociology, more, generally, as, a, conflict, theory, or, structural, conflict, perspective, in, sociology, and, sociology, of, crime, as, this, perspective, is, itself, broad, enough, embracing, as, it, does, a, diversity, of, positions, social, disorganization, theory, is, based, on, the, work, of, henry, mckay, and, clifford, r, shaw, of, the, chicago, school, social, disorganization, theory, postulates, that, neighborhoods, plagued, with, poverty, and, economic, deprivation, tend, to, experience, high, rates, of, population, turnover, this, theory, suggests, that, crime, and, deviance, is, valued, within, groups, in, society, subcultures, or, gangs, these, groups, have, different, values, to, the, social, norm, these, neighborhoods, also, tend, to, have, high, population, heterogeneity, with, high, turnover, informal, social, structure, often, fails, to, develop, which, in, turn, makes, it, difficult, to, maintain, social, order, in, a, community, since, the, 1950s, social, ecology, studies, have, built, on, the, social, disorganization, theories, many, studies, have, found, that, crime, rates, are, associated, with, poverty, disorder, high, numbers, of, abandoned, buildings, and, other, signs, of, community, deterioration, as, working, and, middle, class, people, leave, deteriorating, neighborhoods, the, most, disadvantaged, portions, of, the, population, may, remain, william, julius, wilson, suggested, a, poverty, concentration, effect, which, may, cause, neighborhoods, to, be, isolated, from, the, mainstream, of, society, and, become, prone, to, violence, strain, theory, also, known, as, mertonian, anomie, advanced, by, american, sociologist, robert, merton, suggests, that, mainstream, culture, especially, in, the, united, states, is, saturated, with, dreams, of, opportunity, freedom, and, prosperity, as, merton, put, it, the, american, dream, most, people, buy, into, this, dream, and, it, becomes, a, powerful, cultural, and, psychological, motivator, merton, also, used, the, term, anomie, but, it, meant, something, slightly, different, for, him, than, it, did, for, durkheim, merton, saw, the, term, as, meaning, a, dichotomy, between, what, society, expected, of, its, citizens, and, what, those, citizens, could, actually, achieve, therefore, if, the, social, structure, of, opportunities, is, unequal, and, prevents, the, majority, from, realizing, the, dream, some, of, those, dejected, will, turn, to, illegitimate, means, crime, in, order, to, realize, it, others, will, retreat, or, drop, out, into, deviant, subcultures, such, as, gang, members, or, what, he, calls, hobos, robert, agnew, developed, this, theory, further, to, include, types, of, strain, which, were, not, derived, from, financial, constraints, this, is, known, as, general, strain, theory, following, the, chicago, school, and, strain, theory, and, also, drawing, on, edwin, sutherland, s, idea, of, differential, association, sub, cultural, theorists, focused, on, small, cultural, groups, fragmenting, away, from, the, mainstream, to, form, their, own, values, and, meanings, about, life, albert, k, cohen, tied, anomie, theory, with, sigmund, freud, s, reaction, formation, idea, suggesting, that, delinquency, among, lower, class, youths, is, a, reaction, against, the, social, norms, of, the, middle, class, some, youth, especially, from, poorer, areas, where, opportunities, are, scarce, might, adopt, social, norms, specific, to, those, places, that, may, include, toughness, and, disrespect, for, authority, criminal, acts, may, result, when, youths, conform, to, norms, of, the, deviant, subculture, richard, cloward, and, lloyd, ohlin, suggested, that, delinquency, can, result, from, a, differential, opportunity, for, lower, class, youth, such, youths, may, be, tempted, to, take, up, criminal, activities, choosing, an, illegitimate, path, that, provides, them, more, lucrative, economic, benefits, than, conventional, over, legal, options, such, as, minimum, wage, paying, jobs, available, to, them, delinquency, tends, to, occur, among, the, lower, working, class, males, who, have, a, lack, of, resources, available, to, them, and, live, in, impoverished, areas, as, mentioned, extensively, by, albert, cohen, cohen, 1965, bias, has, been, known, to, occur, among, law, enforcement, agencies, where, officers, tend, to, place, a, bias, on, minority, groups, without, knowing, for, sure, if, they, had, committed, a, crime, or, not, british, sub, cultural, theorists, focused, more, heavily, on, the, issue, of, class, where, some, criminal, activities, were, seen, as, imaginary, solutions, to, the, problem, of, belonging, to, a, subordinate, class, a, further, study, by, the, chicago, school, looked, at, gangs, and, the, influence, of, the, interaction, of, gang, leaders, under, the, observation, of, adults, sociologists, such, as, raymond, d, gastil, have, explored, the, impact, of, a, southern, culture, of, honor, on, violent, crime, rates, another, approach, is, made, by, the, social, bond, or, social, control, theory, instead, of, looking, for, factors, that, make, people, become, criminal, these, theories, try, to, explain, why, people, do, not, become, criminal, travis, hirschi, identified, four, main, characteristics, attachment, to, others, belief, in, moral, validity, of, rules, commitment, to, achievement, and, involvement, in, conventional, activities, the, more, a, person, features, those, characteristics, the, less, likely, he, or, she, is, to, become, deviant, or, criminal, on, the, other, hand, if, these, factors, are, not, present, a, person, is, more, likely, to, become, a, criminal, hirschi, expanded, on, this, theory, with, the, idea, that, a, person, with, low, self, control, is, more, likely, to, become, criminal, as, opposed, to, most, criminology, theories, these, do, not, look, at, why, people, commit, crime, but, rather, why, they, do, not, commit, crime, a, simple, example, someone, wants, a, big, yacht, but, does, not, have, the, means, to, buy, one, if, the, person, cannot, exert, self, control, he, or, she, might, try, to, get, the, yacht, or, the, means, for, it, in, an, illegal, way, whereas, someone, with, high, self, control, will, more, likely, either, wait, deny, themselves, of, what, want, or, seek, an, intelligent, intermediate, solution, such, as, joining, a, yacht, club, to, use, a, yacht, by, group, consolidation, of, resources, without, violating, social, norms, social, bonds, through, peers, parents, and, others, can, have, a, countering, effect, on, one, s, low, self, control, for, families, of, low, socio, economic, status, a, factor, that, distinguishes, families, with, delinquent, children, from, those, who, are, not, delinquent, is, the, control, exerted, by, parents, or, chaperonage, in, addition, theorists, such, as, david, matza, and, gresham, sykes, argued, that, criminals, are, able, to, temporarily, neutralize, internal, moral, and, social, behavioral, constraints, through, techniques, of, neutralization, psychoanalysis, is, a, psychological, theory, and, therapy, which, regards, the, unconscious, mind, repressed, memories, and, trauma, as, the, key, drivers, of, behavior, especially, deviant, behavior, sigmund, freud, talks, about, how, the, unconscious, desire, for, pain, relates, to, psychoanalysis, in, his, essay, beyond, the, pleasure, principle, freud, suggested, that, unconscious, impulses, such, as, repetition, compulsion, and, a, death, drive, can, dominate, a, person, s, creativity, leading, to, self, destructive, behavior, phillida, rosnick, in, the, article, mental, pain, and, social, trauma, posits, a, difference, in, the, thoughts, of, individuals, suffering, traumatic, unconscious, pain, which, corresponds, to, them, having, thoughts, and, feelings, which, are, not, reflections, of, their, true, selves, there, is, enough, correlation, between, this, altered, state, of, mind, and, criminality, to, suggest, causation, sander, gilman, in, the, article, freud, and, the, making, of, psychoanalysis, looks, for, evidence, in, the, physical, mechanisms, of, the, human, brain, and, the, nervous, system, and, suggests, there, is, a, direct, link, between, an, unconscious, desire, for, pain, or, punishment, and, the, impulse, to, commit, crime, or, deviant, acts, symbolic, interactionism, draws, on, the, phenomenology, of, edmund, husserl, and, george, herbert, mead, as, well, as, subcultural, theory, and, conflict, theory, this, school, of, thought, focused, on, the, relationship, between, state, media, and, conservative, ruling, elite, and, other, less, powerful, groups, the, powerful, groups, had, the, ability, to, become, the, significant, other, in, the, less, powerful, groups, processes, of, generating, meaning, the, former, could, to, some, extent, impose, their, meanings, on, the, latter, therefore, they, were, able, to, label, minor, delinquent, youngsters, as, criminal, these, youngsters, would, often, take, the, label, on, board, indulge, in, crime, more, readily, and, become, actors, in, the, self, fulfilling, prophecy, of, the, powerful, groups, later, developments, in, this, set, of, theories, were, by, howard, becker, and, edwin, lemert, in, the, mid, 20th, century, stanley, cohen, developed, the, concept, of, moral, panic, describing, the, societal, reaction, to, spectacular, alarming, social, phenomena, e, g, post, world, war, 2, youth, cultures, like, the, mods, and, rockers, in, the, uk, in, 1964, aids, epidemic, and, football, hooliganism, labeling, theory, refers, to, an, individual, who, is, labeled, by, others, in, a, particular, way, the, theory, was, studied, in, great, detail, by, becker, it, was, originally, derived, from, sociology, but, is, regularly, used, in, criminological, studies, when, someone, is, given, the, label, of, a, criminal, they, may, reject, or, accept, it, and, continue, to, commit, crime, even, those, who, initially, reject, the, label, can, eventually, accept, it, as, the, label, becomes, more, well, known, particularly, among, their, peers, this, stigma, can, become, even, more, profound, when, the, labels, are, about, deviancy, and, it, is, thought, that, this, stigmatization, can, lead, to, deviancy, amplification, malcolm, klein, conducted, a, test, which, showed, that, labeling, theory, affected, some, youth, offenders, but, not, others, at, the, other, side, of, the, spectrum, criminologist, lonnie, athens, developed, a, theory, about, how, a, process, of, brutalization, by, parents, or, peers, that, usually, occurs, in, childhood, results, in, violent, crimes, in, adulthood, richard, rhodes, why, they, kill, describes, athens, observations, about, domestic, and, societal, violence, in, the, criminals, backgrounds, both, athens, and, rhodes, reject, the, genetic, inheritance, theories, rational, choice, theory, is, based, on, the, utilitarian, classical, school, philosophies, of, cesare, beccaria, which, were, popularized, by, jeremy, bentham, they, argued, that, punishment, if, certain, swift, and, proportionate, to, the, crime, was, a, deterrent, for, crime, with, risks, outweighing, possible, benefits, to, the, offender, in, dei, delitti, e, delle, pene, on, crimes, and, punishments, 1763, 1764, beccaria, advocated, a, rational, penology, beccaria, conceived, of, punishment, as, the, necessary, application, of, the, law, for, a, crime, thus, the, judge, was, simply, to, confirm, his, or, her, sentence, to, the, law, beccaria, also, distinguished, between, crime, and, sin, and, advocated, against, the, death, penalty, as, well, as, torture, and, inhumane, treatments, as, he, did, not, consider, them, as, rational, deterrents, this, philosophy, was, replaced, by, the, positivist, and, chicago, schools, and, was, not, revived, until, the, 1970s, with, the, writings, of, james, q, wilson, gary, becker, s, 1965, article, crime, and, punishment, and, george, stigler, s, 1970, article, the, optimum, enforcement, of, laws, rational, choice, theory, argues, that, criminals, like, other, people, weigh, costs, or, risks, and, benefits, when, deciding, whether, to, commit, crime, and, think, in, economic, terms, they, will, also, try, to, minimize, risks, of, crime, by, considering, the, time, place, and, other, situational, factors, becker, for, example, acknowledged, that, many, people, operate, under, a, high, moral, and, ethical, constraint, but, considered, that, criminals, rationally, see, that, the, benefits, of, their, crime, outweigh, the, cost, such, as, the, probability, of, apprehension, and, conviction, severity, of, punishment, as, well, as, their, current, set, of, opportunities, from, the, public, policy, perspective, since, the, cost, of, increasing, the, fine, is, marginal, to, that, of, the, cost, of, increasing, surveillance, one, can, conclude, that, the, best, policy, is, to, maximize, the, fine, and, minimize, surveillance, with, this, perspective, crime, prevention, or, reduction, measures, can, be, devised, to, increase, the, effort, required, to, commit, the, crime, such, as, target, hardening, rational, choice, theories, also, suggest, that, increasing, risk, and, likelihood, of, being, caught, through, added, surveillance, law, enforcement, presence, added, street, lighting, and, other, measures, are, effective, in, reducing, crime, one, of, the, main, differences, between, this, theory, and, bentham, s, rational, choice, theory, which, had, been, abandoned, in, criminology, is, that, if, bentham, considered, it, possible, to, completely, annihilate, crime, through, the, panopticon, becker, s, theory, acknowledged, that, a, society, could, not, eradicate, crime, beneath, a, certain, level, for, example, if, 25, of, a, supermarket, s, products, were, stolen, it, would, be, very, easy, to, reduce, this, rate, to, 15, quite, easy, to, reduce, it, until, 5, difficult, to, reduce, it, under, 3, and, nearly, impossible, to, reduce, it, to, zero, a, feat, which, the, measures, required, would, cost, the, supermarket, so, much, that, it, would, outweigh, the, benefits, this, reveals, that, the, goals, of, utilitarianism, and, classical, liberalism, have, to, be, tempered, and, reduced, to, more, modest, proposals, to, be, practically, applicable, such, rational, choice, theories, linked, to, neoliberalism, have, been, at, the, basics, of, crime, prevention, through, environmental, design, and, underpin, the, market, reduction, approach, to, theft, by, mike, sutton, which, is, a, systematic, toolkit, for, those, seeking, to, focus, attention, on, crime, facilitators, by, tackling, the, markets, for, stolen, goods, that, provide, motivation, for, thieves, to, supply, them, by, theft, routine, activity, theory, developed, by, marcus, felson, and, lawrence, cohen, draws, upon, control, theories, and, explains, crime, in, terms, of, crime, opportunities, that, occur, in, everyday, life, a, crime, opportunity, requires, that, elements, converge, in, time, and, place, including, a, motivated, offender, suitable, target, or, victim, and, lack, of, a, capable, guardian, a, guardian, at, a, place, such, as, a, street, could, include, security, guards, or, even, ordinary, pedestrians, who, would, witness, the, criminal, act, and, possibly, intervene, or, report, it, to, law, enforcement, routine, activity, theory, was, expanded, by, john, eck, who, added, a, fourth, element, of, place, manager, such, as, rental, property, managers, who, can, take, nuisance, abatement, measures, biosocial, criminology, is, an, interdisciplinary, field, that, aims, to, explain, crime, and, antisocial, behavior, by, exploring, both, biological, factors, and, environmental, factors, while, contemporary, criminology, has, been, dominated, by, sociological, theories, biosocial, criminology, also, recognizes, the, potential, contributions, of, fields, such, as, behavioral, genetics, personality, psychology, and, evolutionary, psychology, various, theoretical, frameworks, such, as, evolutionary, neuroandrogenic, theory, have, sought, to, explain, trends, in, criminality, through, the, lens, of, evolutionary, biology, specifically, they, seek, to, explain, why, criminality, is, so, much, higher, in, men, than, in, women, and, why, young, men, are, most, likely, to, exhibit, criminal, behavior, see, also, genetics, of, aggression, aggressive, behavior, has, been, associated, with, abnormalities, in, three, principal, regulatory, systems, in, the, body, serotonin, systems, catecholamine, systems, and, the, hypothalamic, pituitary, adrenocortical, axis, abnormalities, in, these, systems, also, are, known, to, be, induced, by, stress, either, severe, acute, stress, or, chronic, low, grade, stress, biosocial, approaches, remain, very, controversial, within, the, scientific, field, in, 1968, young, british, sociologists, formed, the, national, deviance, conference, ndc, group, the, group, was, restricted, to, academics, and, consisted, of, 300, members, ian, taylor, paul, walton, and, jock, young, members, of, the, ndc, rejected, previous, explanations, of, crime, and, deviance, thus, they, decided, to, pursue, a, new, marxist, criminological, approach, in, the, new, criminology, they, argued, against, the, biological, positivism, perspective, represented, by, lombroso, hans, eysenck, and, gordon, trasler, according, to, the, marxist, perspective, on, crime, defiance, is, normal, the, sense, that, men, are, now, consciously, involved, in, assuring, their, human, diversity, thus, marxists, criminologists, argued, in, support, of, society, in, which, the, facts, of, human, diversity, be, it, social, or, personal, would, not, be, criminalized, they, further, attributed, the, processes, of, crime, creation, not, to, genetic, or, psychological, facts, but, rather, to, the, material, basis, of, a, given, society, state, crime, is, a, distinct, field, of, crimes, that, is, studied, by, marxist, criminology, which, considers, these, crimes, to, be, some, of, the, most, costly, to, society, in, terms, of, overall, harm, injury, in, a, marxist, framework, genocides, environmental, degradation, and, war, are, not, crimes, that, occur, out, of, contempt, for, one, s, fellow, man, but, are, crimes, of, power, they, continue, systems, of, control, and, hegemony, which, allow, state, crime, and, state, corporate, crime, along, with, state, corporate, non, profit, criminals, to, continue, governing, people, convict, criminology, is, a, school, of, thought, in, the, realm, of, criminology, convict, criminologists, have, been, directly, affected, by, the, criminal, justice, system, oftentimes, having, spent, years, inside, the, prison, system, researchers, in, the, field, of, convict, criminology, such, as, john, irwin, and, stephan, richards, argue, that, traditional, criminology, can, better, be, understood, by, those, who, lived, in, the, walls, of, a, prison, martin, leyva, argues, that, prisonization, oftentimes, begins, before, prison, in, the, home, community, and, schools, according, to, rod, earle, convict, criminology, started, in, the, united, states, after, the, major, expansion, of, prisons, in, the, 1970s, and, the, u, s, still, remains, the, main, focus, for, those, who, study, convict, criminology, queer, criminology, is, a, field, of, study, that, focuses, on, lgbt, individuals, and, their, interactions, with, the, criminal, justice, system, the, goals, of, this, field, of, study, are, as, follows, legitimacy, of, queer, criminology, the, value, of, pursuing, criminology, from, a, queer, theorist, perspective, is, contested, some, believe, that, it, is, not, worth, researching, and, not, relevant, to, the, field, as, a, whole, and, as, a, result, is, a, subject, that, lacks, a, wide, berth, of, research, available, on, the, other, hand, it, could, be, argued, that, this, subject, is, highly, valuable, in, highlighting, how, lgbt, individuals, are, affected, by, the, criminal, justice, system, this, research, also, has, the, opportunity, to, queer, the, curriculum, of, criminology, in, educational, institutions, by, shifting, the, focus, from, controlling, and, monitoring, lgbt, communities, to, liberating, and, protecting, them, as, more, and, more, people, identify, as, something, other, than, heterosexual, queer, criminology, continues, to, grow, in, relevance, at, the, same, time, in, jurisdictions, such, as, russia, uganda, and, ghana, governments, have, become, even, more, punitive, through, laws, that, expand, the, criminalisation, of, lgbtq, conduct, relationships, and, organising, digiqueer, criminology, has, emerged, as, a, sub, discipline, of, queer, criminology, and, aims, to, deepen, understanding, of, the, relationship, between, digital, technology, lgbtq, identity, and, justice, cultural, criminology, views, crime, and, its, control, within, the, context, of, culture, ferrell, believes, criminologists, can, examine, the, actions, of, criminals, control, agents, media, producers, and, others, to, construct, the, meaning, of, crime, he, discusses, these, actions, as, a, means, to, show, the, dominant, role, of, culture, kane, adds, that, cultural, criminology, has, three, tropes, village, city, street, and, media, in, which, males, can, be, geographically, influenced, by, society, s, views, on, what, is, broadcast, and, accepted, as, right, or, wrong, the, village, is, where, one, engages, in, available, social, activities, linking, the, history, of, an, individual, to, a, location, can, help, determine, social, dynamics, the, city, street, involves, positioning, oneself, in, the, cultural, area, this, is, full, of, those, affected, by, poverty, poor, health, and, crime, and, large, buildings, that, impact, the, city, but, not, neighborhoods, mass, media, gives, an, all, around, account, of, the, environment, and, the, possible, other, subcultures, that, could, exist, beyond, a, specific, geographical, area, it, was, later, that, naegler, and, salman, introduced, feminist, theory, to, cultural, criminology, and, discussed, masculinity, and, femininity, sexual, attraction, and, sexuality, and, intersectional, themes, naegler, and, salman, believed, that, ferrell, s, mold, was, limited, and, that, they, could, add, to, the, understanding, of, cultural, criminology, by, studying, women, and, those, who, do, not, fit, ferrell, s, mold, hayward, would, later, add, that, not, only, feminist, theory, but, green, theory, as, well, played, a, role, in, the, cultural, criminology, theory, through, the, lens, of, adrenaline, the, soft, city, the, transgressive, subject, and, the, attentive, gaze, the, adrenaline, lens, deals, with, rational, choice, and, what, causes, a, person, to, have, their, own, terms, of, availability, opportunity, and, low, levels, of, social, control, the, soft, city, lens, deals, with, reality, outside, of, the, city, and, the, imaginary, sense, of, reality, the, world, where, transgression, occurs, where, rigidity, is, slanted, and, where, rules, are, bent, the, transgressive, subject, refers, to, a, person, who, is, attracted, to, rule, breaking, and, is, attempting, to, be, themselves, in, a, world, where, everyone, is, against, them, the, attentive, gaze, is, when, someone, mainly, an, ethnographer, is, immersed, into, the, culture, and, interested, in, lifestyle, s, and, the, symbolic, aesthetic, and, visual, aspects, when, examined, they, are, left, with, the, knowledge, that, they, are, not, all, the, same, but, come, to, a, settlement, of, living, together, in, the, same, space, through, it, all, sociological, perspective, on, cultural, criminology, theory, attempts, to, understand, how, the, environment, an, individual, is, in, determines, their, criminal, behavior, relative, deprivation, involves, the, process, where, an, individual, measures, his, or, her, own, well, being, and, materialistic, worth, against, that, of, other, people, and, perceive, that, they, are, worse, off, in, comparison, when, humans, fail, to, obtain, what, they, believe, they, are, owed, they, can, experience, anger, or, jealousy, over, the, notion, that, they, have, been, wrongly, disadvantaged, relative, deprivation, was, originally, utilized, in, the, field, of, sociology, by, samuel, a, stouffer, who, was, a, pioneer, of, this, theory, stouffer, revealed, that, soldiers, fighting, in, world, war, ii, measured, their, personal, success, by, the, experience, in, their, units, rather, than, by, the, standards, set, by, the, military, relative, deprivation, can, be, made, up, of, societal, political, economic, or, personal, factors, which, create, a, sense, of, injustice, it, is, not, based, on, absolute, poverty, a, condition, where, one, cannot, meet, a, necessary, level, to, maintain, basic, living, standards, rather, relative, deprivation, enforces, the, idea, that, even, if, a, person, is, financially, stable, he, or, she, can, still, feel, relatively, deprived, the, perception, of, being, relatively, deprived, can, result, in, criminal, behavior, and, or, morally, problematic, decisions, relative, deprivation, theory, has, increasingly, been, used, to, partially, explain, crime, as, rising, living, standards, can, result, in, rising, crime, levels, in, criminology, the, theory, of, relative, deprivation, explains, that, people, who, feel, jealous, and, discontent, of, others, might, turn, to, crime, to, acquire, the, things, that, they, can, not, afford, rural, criminology, is, the, study, of, crime, trends, outside, of, metropolitan, and, suburban, areas, rural, criminologists, have, used, social, disorganization, and, routine, activity, theories, the, fbi, uniform, crime, report, shows, that, rural, communities, have, significantly, different, crime, trends, as, opposed, to, metropolitan, and, suburban, areas, the, crime, in, rural, communities, consists, predominantly, of, narcotic, related, crimes, such, as, the, production, use, and, trafficking, of, narcotics, social, disorganization, theory, is, used, to, examine, the, trends, involving, narcotics, social, disorganization, leads, to, narcotic, use, in, rural, areas, because, of, low, educational, opportunities, and, high, unemployment, rates, routine, activity, theory, is, used, to, examine, all, low, level, street, crimes, such, as, theft, much, of, the, crime, in, rural, areas, is, explained, through, routine, activity, theory, because, there, is, often, a, lack, of, capable, guardians, in, rural, areas, public, criminology, is, a, strand, within, criminology, closely, tied, to, ideas, associated, with, public, sociology, focused, on, disseminating, criminological, insights, to, a, broader, audience, than, academia, advocates, of, public, criminology, argue, that, criminologists, should, be, conducting, and, disseminating, research, on, crime, law, and, deviance, in, dialogue, with, affected, communities, its, goal, is, for, academics, and, researchers, in, criminology, to, provide, their, research, to, the, public, in, order, to, inform, public, decisions, and, policymaking, this, allows, criminologists, to, avoid, the, constraints, of, traditional, criminological, research, in, doing, so, public, criminology, takes, on, many, forms, including, media, and, policy, advising, as, well, as, activism, civic, oriented, education, community, outreach, expert, testimony, and, knowledge, co, production, both, the, positivist, and, classical, schools, take, a, consensus, view, of, crime, that, a, crime, is, an, act, that, violates, the, basic, values, and, beliefs, of, society, those, values, and, beliefs, are, manifested, as, laws, that, society, agrees, upon, however, there, are, two, types, of, laws, there, have, been, moves, in, contemporary, criminological, theory, to, move, away, from, liberal, pluralism, culturalism, and, postmodernism, by, introducing, the, universal, term, harm, into, the, criminological, debate, as, a, replacement, for, the, legal, term, crime, areas, of, study, in, criminology, include
