it, and, therefore, in, all, their, writings, in, their, mother, tongue, they, borrow, their, letters, from, the, heathens, or, from, the, persians, or, other, nations, in, 1715, a, complete,

the, united, provinces, in, the, nineteenth, century, namely, hindustani, whether, called, by, that, name, or, whether, called, hindi, urdu, or, one, of, the, regional, dialects, such, as, braj, or,

government, offices, though, hindus, continued, to, employ, the, devanagari, script, in, certain, literary, and, religious, contexts, through, the, late, 19th, century, people, did, not, view, urdu, and, hindi, as, being, two, distinct, languages, though, in, urban, areas, the, standardised, hindustani, language, was, increasingly, being, referred, to, as, urdu, and, written, in, the, perso, arabic, script, urdu, and, english, replaced, persian, as, the, official, languages, in, northern, parts, of, india, in, 1837, in, colonial, indian, islamic, schools, muslims, were, taught, persian,

to, teach, urdu, written, in, the, perso, arabic, script, in, these, governmental, educational, institutions, and, after, this, time, urdu, began, to, be, seen, by, indian, muslims, as, a, symbol, of, their, religious, identity, hindus, in, northwestern, india, under, the, arya, samaj, agitated, against, the, sole, use, of, the, perso, arabic, script, and, argued, that, the, language, should, be, written, in, the, native, devanagari, script, which, triggered, a, backlash, against, the, use, of, hindi, written, in, devanagari, by, the, anjuman, e, islamia, of, lahore, hindi, in, the, devanagari, script, and, urdu, written, in, the, perso, arabic, script, established, a, sectarian, divide, of, urdu, for, muslims, and, hindi, for, hindus, a, divide, that, was, formalised, with, the, partition, of, colonial, india, into, the, dominion, of, india, and, the, dominion, of, pakistan, after, independence, though, there, are, hindu, poets, who, continue, to, write, in, urdu, including, gopi, chand, narang, and, gulzar, urdu, had, been, used, as, a, literary, medium, for, british, colonial, indian, writers, from, the, bombay, bengal, orissa, and, hyderabad, state, as, well, before, independence, muslim, league, leader, muhammad, ali, jinnah, advocated, the, use, of, urdu, which, he, used, as, a, symbol, of, national, cohesion, in, pakistan, after, the, bengali, language, movement, and, the, separation, of, former, east, pakistan, urdu, was, recognised, as, the, sole, national, language, of, pakistan, in, 1973, although, english, and, regional, languages, were, also, granted, official, recognition, following, the, 1979, soviet, invasion, of, afghanistan, and, subsequent, arrival, of, millions, of, afghan, refugees, who, have, lived, in, pakistan, for, many, decades, many, afghans, including, those, who, moved, back, to, afghanistan, have, also, become, fluent, in, hindi, urdu, an, occurrence, aided, by, exposure, to, the, indian, media, chiefly, hindi, urdu, bollywood, films, and, songs, there, have, been, attempts, to, purge, urdu, of, native, prakrit, and, sanskrit, words, and, hindi, of, persian, loanwords, new, vocabulary, draws, primarily, from, persian, and, arabic, for, urdu, and, from, sanskrit, for, hindi, english, has, exerted, a, heavy, influence, on, both, as, a, co, official, language, according, to, bruce, 2021, urdu, has, adapted, english, words, since, the, eighteenth, century, a, movement, towards, the, hyper, persianisation, of, an, urdu, emerged, in, pakistan, since, its, independence, in, 1947, which, is, as, artificial, as, the, hyper, sanskritised, hindi, that, has, emerged, in, india, hyper, persianisation, of, urdu, was, prompted, in, part, by, the, increasing, sanskritisation, of, hindi, however, the, style, of, urdu, spoken, on, a, day, to, day, basis, in, pakistan, is, akin, to, neutral, hindustani, that, serves, as, the, lingua, franca, of, the, northern, indian, subcontinent, since, at, least, 1977, some, commentators, such, as, journalist, khushwant, singh, have, characterised, urdu, as, a, dying, language, though, others, such, as, indian, poet, and, writer, gulzar, who, is, popular, in, both, countries, and, both, language, communities, but, writes, only, in, urdu, script, and, has, difficulties, reading, devanagari, so, he, lets, others, transcribe, his, work, have, disagreed, with, this, assessment, and, state, that, urdu, is, the, most, alive, language, and, moving, ahead, with, times, in, india, this, phenomenon, pertains, to, the, decrease, in, relative, and, absolute, numbers, of, native, urdu, speakers, as, opposed, to, speakers, of, other, languages, declining, advanced, knowledge, of, urdu, s, perso, arabic, script, urdu, vocabulary, and, grammar, the, role, of, translation, and, transliteration, of, literature, from, and, into, urdu, the, shifting, cultural, image, of, urdu, and, socio, economic, status, associated, with, urdu, speakers, which, negatively, impacts, especially, their, employment, opportunities, in, both, countries, the, de, jure, legal, status, and, de, facto, political, status, of, urdu, how, much, urdu, is, used, as, language, of, instruction, and, chosen, by, students, in, higher, education, and, how, the, maintenance, and, development, of, urdu, is, financially, and, institutionally, supported, by, governments, and, ngos, in, india, although, urdu, is, not, and, never, was, used, exclusively, by, muslims, and, hindi, never, exclusively, by, hindus, the, ongoing, hindi, urdu, controversy, and, modern, cultural, association, of, each, language, with, the, two, religions, has, led, to, fewer, hindus, using, urdu, in, the, 20th, century, indian, muslims, gradually, began, to, collectively, embrace, urdu, for, example, post, independence, muslim, politics, of, bihar, saw, a, mobilisation, around, the, urdu, language, as, tool, of, empowerment, for, minorities, especially, coming, from, weaker, socio, economic, backgrounds, but, in, the, early, 21st, century, an, increasing, percentage, of, indian, muslims, began, switching, to, hindi, due, to, socio, economic, factors, such, as, urdu, being, abandoned, as, the, language, of, instruction, in, much, of, india, and, having, limited, employment, opportunities, compared, to, hindi, english, and, regional, languages, the, number, of, urdu, speakers, in, india, fell, 1, 5, between, 2001, and, 2011, then, 5, 08, million, urdu, speakers, especially, in, the, most, urdu, speaking, states, of, uttar, pradesh, c, 8, to, 5, and, bihar, c, 11, 5, to, 8, 5, even, though, the, number, of, muslims, in, these, two, states, grew, in, the, same, period, although, urdu, is, still, very, prominent, in, early, 21st, century, indian, pop, culture, ranging, from, bollywood, to, social, media, knowledge, of, the, urdu, script, and, the, publication, of, books, in, urdu, have, steadily, declined, while, policies, of, the, indian, government, do, not, actively, support, the, preservation, of, urdu, in, professional, and, official, spaces, because, the, pakistani, government, proclaimed, urdu, the, national, language, at, partition, the, indian, state, and, some, religious, nationalists, began, in, part, to, regard, urdu, as, a, foreign, language, to, be, viewed, with, suspicion, urdu, advocates, in, india, disagree, whether, it, should, be, allowed, to, write, urdu, in, the, devanagari, and, latin, script, roman, urdu, to, allow, its, survival, or, whether, this, will, only, hasten, its, demise, and, that, the, language, can, only, be, preserved, if, expressed, in, the, perso, arabic, script, for, pakistan, willoughby, aftab, 2020, argued, that, urdu, originally, had, the, image, of, a, refined, elite, language, of, the, enlightenment, progress, and, emancipation, which, contributed, to, the, success, of, the, independence, movement, but, after, the, 1947, partition, when, it, was, chosen, as, the, national, language, of, pakistan, to, unite, all, inhabitants, with, one, linguistic, identity, it, faced, serious, competition, primarily, from, bengali, spoken, by, 56, of, the, total, population, mostly, in, east, pakistan, until, that, attained, independence, in, 1971, as, bangladesh, and, after, 1971, from, english, both, pro, independence, elites, that, formed, the, leadership, of, the, muslim, league, in, pakistan, and, the, hindu, dominated, congress, party, in, india, had, been, educated, in, english, during, the, british, colonial, period, and, continued, to, operate, in, english, and, send, their, children, to, english, medium, schools, as, they, continued, dominate, both, countries, post, partition, politics, although, the, anglicized, elite, in, pakistan, has, made, attempts, at, urduisation, of, education, with, varying, degrees, of, success, no, successful, attempts, were, ever, made, to, urduise, politics, the, legal, system, the, army, or, the, economy, all, of, which, remained, solidly, anglophone, even, the, regime, of, general, zia, ul, haq, 1977, 1988, who, came, from, a, middle, class, punjabi, family, and, initially, fervently, supported, a, rapid, and, complete, urduisation, of, pakistani, society, earning, him, the, honorary, title, of, the, patron, of, urdu, in, 1981, failed, to, make, significant, achievements, and, by, 1987, had, abandoned, most, of, his, efforts, in, favour, of, pro, english, policies, since, the, 1960s, the, urdu, lobby, and, eventually, the, urdu, language, in, pakistan, has, been, associated, with, religious, islamism, and, political, national, conservatism, and, eventually, the, lower, and, lower, middle, classes, alongside, regional, languages, such, as, punjabi, sindhi, and, balochi, while, english, has, been, associated, with, the, internationally, oriented, secular, and, progressive, left, and, eventually, the, upper, and, upper, middle, classes, despite, governmental, attempts, at, urduisation, of, pakistan, the, position, and, prestige, of, english, only, grew, stronger, in, the, meantime, there, are, over, 100, million, native, speakers, of, urdu, in, india, and, pakistan, together, there, were, 50, 8, million, urdu, speakers, in, india, 4, 34, of, the, total, population, as, per, the, 2011, census, and, approximately, 16, million, in, pakistan, in, 2006, there, are, several, hundred, thousand, in, the, united, kingdom, saudi, arabia, united, states, and, bangladesh, however, hindustani, of, which, urdu, is, one, variety, is, spoken, much, more, widely, forming, the, third, most, commonly, spoken, language, in, the, world, after, mandarin, and, english, the, syntax, grammar, morphology, and, the, core, vocabulary, of, urdu, and, hindi, are, essentially, identical, thus, linguists, usually, count, them, as, one, single, language, while, some, contend, that, they, are, considered, as, two, different, languages, for, socio, political, reasons, owing, to, interaction, with, other, languages, urdu, has, become, localised, wherever, it, is, spoken, including, in, pakistan, urdu, in, pakistan, has, undergone, changes, and, has, incorporated, and, borrowed, many, words, from, regional, languages, thus, allowing, speakers, of, the, language, in, pakistan, to, distinguish, themselves, more, easily, and, giving, the, language, a, decidedly, pakistani, flavor, similarly, the, urdu, spoken, in, india, can, also, be, distinguished, into, many, dialects, such, as, the, standard, urdu, of, lucknow, and, delhi, as, well, as, the, dakhni, deccan, of, south, india, because, of, urdu, s, similarity, to, hindi, speakers, of, the, two, languages, can, easily, understand, one, another, if, both, sides, refrain, from, using, literary, vocabulary, although, urdu, is, widely, spoken, and, understood, throughout, all, of, pakistan, only, 9, of, pakistan, s, population, spoke, urdu, according, to, the, 2023, pakistani, census, most, of, the, nearly, three, million, afghan, refugees, of, different, ethnic, origins, such, as, pashtun, tajik, uzbek, hazarvi, and, turkmen, who, stayed, in, pakistan, for, over, twenty, five, years, have, also, become, fluent, in, urdu, muhajirs, since, 1947, have, historically, formed, the, majority, population, in, the, city, of, karachi, however, many, newspapers, are, published, in, urdu, in, pakistan, including, the, daily, jang, nawa, i, waqt, and, millat, no, region, in, pakistan, uses, urdu, as, its, mother, tongue, though, it, is, spoken, as, the, first, language, of, muslim, migrants, known, as, muhajirs, in, pakistan, who, left, india, after, independence, in, 1947, other, communities, most, notably, the, punjabi, elite, of, pakistan, have, adopted, urdu, as, a, mother, tongue, and, identify, with, both, an, urdu, speaker, as, well, as, punjabi, identity, urdu, was, chosen, as, a, symbol, of, unity, for, the, new, state, of, pakistan, in, 1947, because, it, had, already, served, as, a, lingua, franca, among, muslims, in, north, and, northwest, british, india, it, is, written, spoken, and, used, in, all, provinces, territories, of, pakistan, and, together, with, english, as, the, main, languages, of, instruction, although, the, people, from, differing, provinces, may, have, different, native, languages, urdu, is, taught, as, a, compulsory, subject, up, to, higher, secondary, school, in, both, english, and, urdu, medium, school, systems, which, has, produced, millions, of, second, language, urdu, speakers, among, people, whose, native, language, is, one, of, the, other, languages, of, pakistan, which, in, turn, has, led, to, the, absorption, of, vocabulary, from, various, regional, pakistani, languages, while, some, urdu, vocabularies, has, also, been, assimilated, by, pakistan, s, regional, languages, some, who, are, from, a, non, urdu, background, now, can, read, and, write, only, urdu, with, such, a, large, number, of, people, s, speaking, urdu, the, language, has, acquired, a, peculiar, pakistani, flavor, further, distinguishing, it, from, the, urdu, spoken, by, native, speakers, resulting, in, more, diversity, within, the, language, in, india, urdu, is, spoken, in, places, where, there, are, large, muslim, minorities, or, cities, that, were, bases, for, muslim, empires, in, the, past, these, include, parts, of, uttar, pradesh, madhya, pradesh, bihar, telangana, andhra, pradesh, maharashtra, marathwada, and, konkanis, karnataka, and, cities, such, as, hyderabad, lucknow, delhi, malerkotla, bareilly, meerut, saharanpur, muzaffarnagar, roorkee, deoband, moradabad, azamgarh, bijnor,

than, 3, 000, urdu, publications, including, 405, daily, urdu, newspapers, newspapers, such, as, neshat, news, urdu, sahara, urdu, daily, salar, hindustan, express, daily, pasban, siasat, daily, the,

practicality, as, the, lingua, franca, the, significance, of, urdu, as, a, national, symbol, was, downplayed, by, these, disputes, when, english, and, bengali, were, also, accepted, as, official,

several, monthly, magazines, in, urdu, are, published, in, these, states, dhakaiya, urdu, is, a, dialect, native, to, the, city, of, old, dhaka, in, bangladesh, dating, back, to, the, mughal, era, however, its, popularity, even, amongst, native, speakers, has, been, gradually, declining, since, the, bengali, language, movement, in, the, 20th, century, it, is, not, officially, recognised, by, the, government, of, bangladesh, the, urdu, spoken, by, stranded, pakistanis, in, bangladesh, is, different, from, this, dialect, many, bilingual, or, multi, lingual, urdu, speakers, being, familiar, with, both, urdu, and, english, display, code, switching, referred, to, as, urdish, in, certain, localities, and, between, certain, social, groups, on, 14, august, 2015, the, government, of, pakistan, launched, the, ilm, pakistan, movement, with, a, uniform, curriculum, in, urdish, ahsan, iqbal, federal, minister, of, pakistan, said, now, the, government, is, working, on, a, new, curriculum, to, provide, a, new, medium, to, the, students, which, will, be, the, combination, of, both, urdu, and, english, and, will, name, it, urdish, standard, urdu, is, often, compared, with, standard, hindi, both, urdu, and, hindi, which, are, considered, standard, registers, of, the, same, language, hindustani, or, hindi, urdu, share, a, core, vocabulary, and, grammar, apart, from, religious, associations, the, differences, are, largely, restricted, to, the, standard, forms, standard, urdu, is, conventionally, written, in, the, nastaliq, style, of, the, persian, alphabet, and, relies, heavily, on, persian, and, arabic, as, a, source, for, technical, and, literary, vocabulary, whereas, standard, hindi, is, conventionally, written, in, devan, gar, and, draws, on, sanskrit, however, both, share, a, core, vocabulary, of, native, sanskrit, and, prakrit, derived, words, and, a, significant, amount, of, arabic, and, persian, loanwords, with, a, consensus, of, linguists, considering, them, to, be, two, standardised, forms, of, the, same, language, and, consider, the, differences, to, be, sociolinguistic, a, few, classify, them, separately, the, two, languages, are, often, considered, to, be, a, single, language, hindustani, or, hindi, urdu, on, a, dialect, continuum, ranging, from, persianised, to, sanskritised, vocabulary, but, now, they, are, more, and, more, different, in, words, due, to, politics, old, urdu, dictionaries, also, contain, most, of, the, sanskrit, words, now, present, in, hindi, mutual, intelligibility, decreases, in, literary, and, specialised, contexts, that, rely, on, academic, or, technical, vocabulary, in, a, longer, conversation, differences, in, formal, vocabulary, and, pronunciation, of, some, urdu, phonemes, are, noticeable, though, many, native, hindi, speakers, also, pronounce, these, phonemes, at, a, phonological, level, speakers, of, both, languages, are, frequently, aware, of, the, perso, arabic, or, sanskrit, origins, of, their, word, choice, which, affects, the, pronunciation, of, those, words, urdu, speakers, will, often, insert, vowels, to, break, up, consonant, clusters, found, in, words, of, sanskritic, origin, but, will, pronounce, them, correctly, in, arabic, and, persian, loanwords, as, a, result, of, religious, nationalism, since, the, partition, of, british, india, and, continued, communal, tensions, native, speakers, of, both, hindi, and, urdu, frequently, assert, that, they, are, distinct, languages, the, grammar, of, hindi, and, urdu, is, shared, though, formal, urdu, makes, more, use, of, the, persian, e, izafat, grammatical, construct, as, in, hammam, e, qadimi, or, nishan, e, haider, than, does, hindi, the, following, table, shows, the, number, of, urdu, speakers, in, some, countries, syed, ahmed, dehlavi, a, 19th, century, lexicographer, who, compiled, the, farhang, e, asifiya, urdu, dictionary, estimated, that, 75, of, urdu, words, have, their, etymological, roots, in, sanskrit, and, prakrit, and, approximately, 99, of, urdu, verbs, have, their, roots, in, sanskrit, and, prakrit, urdu, has, borrowed, words, from, persian, and, to, a, lesser, extent, arabic, through, persian, to, the, extent, of, about, 25, to, 30, of, urdu, s, vocabulary, a, table, illustrated, by, the, linguist, afroz, taj, of, the, university, of, north, carolina, at, chapel, hill, likewise, illustrates, the, amount, of, persian, loanwords, to, native, sanskrit, derived, words, in, literary, urdu, as, comprising, a, 1, 3, ratio, the, trend, towards, persianisation, started, in, the, 18th, century, by, the, delhi, school, of, urdu, poets, though, other, writers, such, as, meeraji, wrote, in, a, sanskritised, form, of, the, language, there, has, been, a, move, towards, hyper, persianisation, in, pakistan, since, 1947, which, has, been, adopted, by, much, of, the, country, s, writers, as, such, some, urdu, texts, can, be, composed, of, 70, perso, arabic, loanwords, just, as, some, persian, texts, can, have, 70, arabic, vocabulary, some, pakistani, urdu, speakers, have, incorporated, hindi, vocabulary, into, their, speech, as, a, result, of, exposure, to, indian, entertainment, in, india, urdu, has, not, diverged, from, hindi, as, much, as, it, has, in, pakistan, most, borrowed, words, in, urdu, are, nouns, and, adjectives, many, of, the, words, of, arabic, origin, have, been, adopted, through, persian, and, have, different, pronunciations, and, nuances, of, meaning, and, usage, than, they, do, in, arabic, there, are, also, a, smaller, number, of, borrowings, from, portuguese, some, examples, for, portuguese, words, borrowed, into, urdu, are, chabi, chave, key, girja, igreja, church, kamra, c, mara, room, qam, z, camisa, shirt, although, the, word, urdu, is, derived, from, the, turkic, word, ordu, army, or, orda, from, which, english, horde, is, also, derived, turkic, borrowings, in, urdu, are, minimal, and, urdu, is, also, not, genetically, related, to, the, turkic, languages, urdu, words, originating, from, chagatai, and, arabic, were, borrowed, through, persian, and, hence, are, persianised, versions, of, the, original, words, for, instance, the, arabic, ta, marbuta, changes, to, he, or, te, nevertheless, contrary, to, popular, belief, urdu, did, not, borrow, from, the, turkish, language, but, from, chagatai, a, turkic, language, from, central, asia, urdu, and, turkish, both, borrowed, from, arabic, and, persian, hence, the, similarity, in, pronunciation, of, many, urdu, and, turkish, words, urdu, in, its, less, formalised, register, is, known, as, rekhta, rek, h, tah, rough, mixture, urdu, pronunciation, the, more, formal, register, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, zab, n, i, urd, yi, mu, all, language, of, the, exalted, camp, urdu, pronunciation, or, lashkari, zab, n, military, language, urdu, pronunciation, referring, to, the, imperial, army, or, simply, lashkari, the, etymology, of, the, word, used, in, urdu, for, the, most, part, decides, how, polite, or, refined, one, s, speech, is, for, example, urdu, speakers, distinguish, between, p, n, and, b, both, meaning, water, the, former, is, used, colloquially, and, has, older, sanskrit, origins, the, latter, is, used, formally, and, poetically, being, of, persian, origin, if, a, word, is, of, persian, or, arabic, origin, the, level, of, speech, is, considered, to, be, more, formal, and, grander, similarly, if, persian, or, arabic, grammar, constructs, such, as, the, izafat, are, used, in, urdu, the, level, of, speech, is, also, considered, more, formal, if, a, word, is, inherited, from, sanskrit, the, level, of, speech, is, considered, more, colloquial, and, personal, urdu, is, written, right, to, left, in, an, extension, of, the, persian, alphabet, which, is, itself, an, extension, of, the, arabic, alphabet, urdu, is, associated, with, the, nasta, l, q, style, of, persian, calligraphy, whereas, arabic, is, generally, written, in, the, naskh, or, ruq, ah, styles, because, of, its, thousands, of, ligatures, nasta, liq, is, notoriously, difficult, to, typeset, so, urdu, newspapers, were, hand, written, by, masters, of, calligraphy, known, as, k, tib, or, kh, ush, naw, s, until, the, late, 1980s, one, handwritten, urdu, newspaper, the, musalman, is, still, published, daily, in, chennai, inpage, a, widely, used, desktop, publishing, tool, for, urdu, has, over, 20, 000, ligatures, in, its, nasta, liq, computer, fonts, a, highly, persianised, and, technical, form, of, urdu, was, the, lingua, franca, of, the, law, courts, of, the, british, administration, in, bengal, and, the, north, west, provinces, oudh, until, the, late, 19th, century, all, proceedings, and, court, transactions, in, this, register, of, urdu, were, written, officially, in, the, persian, script, in, 1880, sir, ashley, eden, the, lieutenant, governor, of, bengal, in, colonial, india, abolished, the, use, of, the, persian, alphabet, in, the, law, courts, of, bengal, and, ordered, the, exclusive, use, of, kaithi, a, popular, script, used, for, both, urdu, and, hindi, in, the, bihar, province, the, court, language, was, urdu, written, in, the, kaithi, script, kaithi, s, association, with, urdu, and, hindi, was, ultimately, eliminated, by, the, political, contest, between, these, languages, and, their, scripts, in, which, the, persian, script, was, definitively, linked, to, urdu, more, recently, in, india, urdu, speakers, have, adopted, devanagari, for, publishing, urdu, periodicals, and, have, innovated, new, strategies, to, mark, urdu, in, devanagari, as, distinct, from, hindi, in, devanagari, such, publishers, have, introduced, new, orthographic, features, into, devanagari, for, the, purpose, of, representing, the, perso, arabic, etymology, of, urdu, words, one, example, is, the, use, of, devanagari, a, with, vowel, signs, to, mimic, contexts, of, ain, in, violation, of, hindi, orthographic, rules, for, urdu, publishers, the, use, of, devanagari, gives, them, a, greater, audience, whereas, the, orthographic, changes, help, them, preserve, a, distinct, identity, of, urdu, some, poets, from, bengal, namely, qazi, nazrul, islam, have, historically, used, the, bengali, script, to, write, urdu, poetry, like, prem, nagar, ka, thikana, karle, and, mera, beti, ki, khela, as, well, as, bilingual, bengali, urdu, poems, like, alga, koro, go, kh, par, b, dhon, juboker, chholona, and, mera, dil, betab, kiya, dhakaiya, urdu, is, a, colloquial, non, standard, dialect, of, urdu, which, was, typically, not, written, however, organisations, seeking, to, preserve, the, dialect, have, begun, transcribing, the, dialect, in, the, bengali, script
