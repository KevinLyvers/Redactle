hope, is, an, optimistic, state, of, mind, that, is, based, on, an, expectation, of, positive, outcomes, with, respect, to, events, and, circumstances, in, one, s, life, or, the, world, at, large, as, a, verb, its, definitions, include, expect, with, confidence, and, to, cherish, a, desire, with, anticipation, among, its, opposites, are, dejection, hopelessness, and, despair, hope, finds, expression, through, many, dimensions, of, human, life, including, practical, reasoning, the, religious, virtue, of, hope, legal, doctrine, and, literature, alongside, cultural, and, mythological, aspects, professor, of, psychology, barbara, fredrickson, argues, that, hope, comes, into, its, own, when, crisis, looms, opening, us, to, new, creative, possibilities, frederickson, argues, that, with, great, need, comes, an, unusually, wide, range, of, ideas, as, well, as, such, positive, emotions, as, happiness, and, joy, courage, and, empowerment, drawn, from, four, different, areas, of, one, s, self, from, a, cognitive, psychological, social, or, physical, perspective, such, positive, thinking, bears, fruit, when, based, on, a, realistic, sense, of, optimism, not, on, a, naive, false, hope, the, psychologist, charles, r, snyder, linked, hope, to, the, existence, of, a, goal, combined, with, a, determined, plan, for, reaching, that, goal, alfred, adler, had, similarly, argued, for, the, centrality, of, goal, seeking, in, human, psychology, as, too, had, philosophical, anthropologists, like, ernst, bloch, snyder, also, stressed, the, link, between, hope, and, mental, willpower, hardiness, as, well, as, the, need, for, realistic, perception, of, goals, problem, orientation, arguing, that, the, difference, between, hope, and, optimism, was, that, the, former, can, look, like, wishful, thinking, but, the, latter, provides, the, energy, to, find, practical, pathways, for, an, improved, future, d, w, winnicott, saw, a, child, s, antisocial, behavior, as, expressing, as, a, cry, for, help, an, unconscious, hope, meaning, an, unspoken, desire, for, a, positive, outcome, for, those, who, are, in, control, in, the, wider, society, when, containment, within, the, immediate, family, had, failed, object, relations, theory, similarly, sees, the, analytic, transference, as, motivated, in, part, by, an, unconscious, hope, that, past, conflicts, and, traumas, can, be, dealt, with, anew, as, a, specialist, in, positive, psychology, snyder, studied, how, hope, and, forgiveness, can, impact, several, aspects, of, life, such, as, health, work, education, and, personal, meaning, he, postulated, that, there, are, three, main, things, that, make, up, hopeful, thinking, in, other, words, hope, was, defined, as, the, perceived, capability, to, derive, pathways, to, desired, goals, and, motivate, oneself, via, agency, thinking, to, use, those, pathways, snyder, argues, that, individuals, who, are, able, to, realize, these, three, components, and, develop, a, belief, in, their, ability, are, hopeful, people, who, can, establish, clear, goals, imagine, multiple, workable, pathways, toward, those, goals, and, persevere, even, when, obstacles, get, in, their, way, snyder, proposed, a, hope, scale, which, considered, that, a, person, s, determination, to, achieve, their, goal, is, their, measured, hope, snyder, differentiates, between, adult, measured, hope, and, child, measured, hope, the, adult, hope, scale, by, snyder, contains, 12, questions, 4, measuring, pathways, thinking, 4, measuring, agency, thinking, and, 4, that, are, simply, fillers, each, subject, responds, to, each, question, using, an, 8, point, scale, fibel, and, hale, measure, hope, by, combining, snyder, s, hope, scale, with, their, own, generalized, expectancy, for, success, scale, gess, to, empirically, measure, hope, snyder, regarded, that, psychotherapy, can, help, focus, attention, on, one, s, goals, drawing, on, tacit, knowledge, of, how, to, reach, them, similarly, there, is, an, outlook, and, a, grasp, of, reality, to, hope, distinguishing, no, hope, lost, hope, false, hope, and, real, hope, which, differ, in, terms, of, viewpoint, and, realism, contemporary, philosopher, richard, rorty, understands, hope, as, more, than, goal, setting, rather, as, a, metanarrative, a, story, that, serves, as, a, promise, or, reason, for, expecting, a, better, future, rorty, as, postmodernist, believes, past, meta, narratives, including, the, christian, story, utilitarianism, and, marxism, have, proved, false, hopes, that, theory, cannot, offer, social, hope, and, that, liberal, man, must, learn, to, live, without, a, consensual, theory, of, social, hope, rorty, says, a, new, document, of, promise, is, needed, for, social, hope, to, exist, again, of, the, countless, models, that, examine, the, importance, of, hope, in, an, individual, s, life, two, major, theories, have, gained, a, significant, amount, of, recognition, in, the, field, of, psychology, one, of, these, theories, developed, by, charles, r, snyder, argues, that, hope, should, be, viewed, as, a, cognitive, skill, that, demonstrates, an, individual, s, ability, to, maintain, drive, in, the, pursuit, of, a, particular, goal, this, model, reasons, that, an, individual, s, ability, to, be, hopeful, depends, on, two, types, of, thinking, agency, thinking, and, pathway, thinking, agency, thinking, refers, to, an, individual, s, determination, to, achieve, their, goals, despite, possible, obstacles, while, pathway, thinking, refers, to, the, ways, in, which, an, individual, believes, they, can, achieve, these, personal, goals, snyder, s, theory, uses, hope, as, a, mechanism, that, is, most, often, seen, in, psychotherapy, in, these, instances, the, therapist, helps, their, client, overcome, barriers, that, have, prevented, them, from, achieving, goals, the, therapist, would, then, help, the, client, set, realistic, and, relevant, personal, goals, i, e, i, am, going, to, find, something, i, am, passionate, about, and, that, makes, me, feel, good, about, myself, and, would, help, them, remain, hopeful, of, their, ability, to, achieve, these, goals, and, suggest, the, correct, pathways, to, do, so, whereas, snyder, s, theory, focuses, on, hope, as, a, mechanism, to, overcome, an, individual, s, lack, of, motivation, to, achieve, goals, the, other, major, theory, developed, by, kaye, a, herth, deals, more, specifically, with, an, individual, s, future, goals, as, they, relate, to, coping, with, illnesses, herth, views, hope, as, a, motivational, and, cognitive, attribute, that, is, theoretically, necessary, to, initiate, and, sustain, action, toward, goal, attainment, establishing, realistic, and, attainable, goals, in, this, situation, is, more, difficult, as, the, individual, most, likely, does, not, have, direct, control, over, the, future, of, their, health, instead, herth, suggests, that, the, goals, should, be, concerned, with, how, the, individual, is, going, to, personally, deal, with, the, illness, instead, of, drinking, to, ease, the, pain, of, my, illness, i, am, going, to, surround, myself, with, friends, and, family, while, the, nature, of, the, goals, in, snyder, s, model, differ, with, those, in, herth, s, model, they, both, view, hope, as, a, way, to, maintain, personal, motivation, which, ultimately, will, result, in, a, greater, sense, of, optimism, hope, and, more, specifically, particularized, hope, has, been, shown, to, be, an, important, part, of, the, recovery, process, from, illness, it, has, strong, psychological, benefits, for, patients, helping, them, to, cope, more, effectively, with, their, disease, for, example, hope, motivates, people, to, pursue, healthy, behaviors, for, recovery, such, as, eating, fruits, and, vegetables, quitting, smoking, and, engaging, in, regular, physical, activity, this, not, only, helps, to, enhance, people, s, recovery, from, illnesses, but, also, helps, prevent, illness, from, developing, in, the, first, place, patients, who, maintain, high, levels, of, hope, have, an, improved, prognosis, for, life, threatening, illness, and, an, enhanced, quality, of, life, belief, and, expectation, which, are, key, elements, of, hope, block, pain, in, patients, suffering, from, chronic, illness, by, releasing, endorphins, and, mimicking, the, effects, of, morphine, consequently, through, this, process, belief, and, expectation, can, set, off, a, chain, reaction, in, the, body, that, can, make, recovery, from, chronic, illness, more, likely, this, chain, reaction, is, especially, evident, with, studies, demonstrating, the, placebo, effect, a, situation, when, hope, is, the, only, variable, aiding, in, these, patients, recovery, overall, studies, have, demonstrated, that, maintaining, a, sense, of, hope, during, a, period, of, recovery, from, illness, is, beneficial, a, sense, of, hopelessness, during, the, recovery, period, has, in, many, instances, resulted, in, adverse, health, conditions, for, the, patient, i, e, depression, and, anxiety, following, the, recovery, process, additionally, having, a, greater, amount, of, hope, before, and, during, cognitive, therapy, has, led, to, decreased, ptsd, related, depression, symptoms, in, war, veterans, hope, has, also, been, found, to, be, associated, with, more, positive, perceptions, of, subjective, health, however, reviews, of, research, literature, have, noted, that, the, connections, between, hope, and, symptom, severity, in, other, mental, health, disorders, are, less, clear, such, as, in, cases, of, individuals, with, schizophrenia, hope, is, a, powerful, protector, against, chronic, or, life, threatening, illnesses, a, person, s, hope, even, when, facing, an, illness, that, will, likely, end, their, life, can, be, helpful, by, finding, joy, or, comfort, it, can, be, created, and, focused, on, achieving, life, goals, such, as, meeting, grandchildren, or, attending, a, child, s, wedding, hope, can, be, an, opportunity, for, us, to, process, and, go, through, events, that, can, be, traumatic, a, setback, in, life, an, accident, or, our, own, final, months, of, living, can, be, times, when, hope, is, comfort, and, serves, as, a, pathway, from, one, stage, to, the, next, the, inclusion, of, hope, in, treatment, programs, has, potential, in, both, physical, and, mental, health, settings, hope, as, a, mechanism, for, improved, treatment, has, been, studied, in, the, contexts, of, ptsd, chronic, physical, illness, and, terminal, illness, among, other, disorders, and, ailments, within, mental, health, practice, clinicians, have, suggested, using, hope, interventions, as, a, supplement, to, more, traditional, cognitive, behavioral, therapies, in, terms, of, support, for, physical, illness, research, suggests, that, hope, can, encourage, the, release, of, endorphins, and, enkephalins, which, help, to, block, pain, there, are, two, main, arguments, based, on, judgment, against, those, who, are, advocates, of, using, hope, to, help, treat, severe, illnesses, the, first, of, which, is, that, if, physicians, have, too, much, hope, they, may, aggressively, treat, the, patient, the, physician, will, hold, on, to, a, small, shred, of, hope, that, the, patient, may, get, better, thus, this, causes, them, to, try, methods, that, are, costly, and, may, have, many, side, effects, one, physician, noted, that, she, regretted, having, hope, for, her, patient, it, resulted, in, her, patient, suffering, through, three, more, years, of, pain, that, the, patient, would, not, have, endured, if, the, physician, had, realized, recovery, was, unfeasible, the, second, argument, is, the, division, between, hope, and, wishing, those, that, are, hopeful, are, actively, trying, to, investigate, the, best, path, of, action, while, taking, into, consideration, the, obstacles, research, has, shown, though, that, many, of, those, who, have, hope, are, wishfully, thinking, and, passively, going, through, the, motions, as, if, they, are, in, denial, about, their, actual, circumstances, being, in, denial, and, having, too, much, hope, may, negatively, impact, both, the, patient, and, the, physician, the, impact, that, hope, can, have, on, a, patient, s, recovery, process, is, strongly, supported, through, both, empirical, research, and, theoretical, approaches, however, reviews, of, literature, also, maintain, that, more, longitudinal, and, methodologically, sound, research, is, needed, to, establish, which, hope, interventions, are, actually, the, most, effective, and, in, what, setting, i, e, chronic, illness, vs, terminal, illness, in, the, matter, of, globalization, hope, is, focused, on, economic, and, social, empowerment, focusing, on, parts, of, asia, hope, has, taken, on, a, secular, or, materialistic, form, in, relation, to, the, pursuit, of, economic, growth, primary, examples, are, the, rise, of, the, economies, of, china, and, india, correlating, with, the, notion, of, chindia, a, secondary, relevant, example, is, the, increased, use, of, contemporary, architecture, in, rising, economies, such, as, the, building, of, the, shanghai, world, financial, center, burj, khalifa, and, taipei, 101, which, has, given, rise, to, a, prevailing, hope, within, the, countries, of, origin, in, chaotic, environments, hope, is, transcended, without, cultural, boundaries, syrian, refugee, children, are, supported, by, unesco, s, education, project, through, creative, education, and, psycho, social, assistance, other, inter, cultural, support, for, instilling, hope, involve, food, culture, disengaging, refugees, from, trauma, through, immersing, them, in, their, rich, cultural, past, hope, has, been, widely, recognized, as, a, crucial, and, inherent, aspect, of, human, existence, not, only, by, philosophers, from, various, backgrounds, but, also, by, national, and, international, courts, particularly, in, the, past, decade, serving, as, an, existential, element, within, each, individual, hope, manifests, itself, in, various, ways, in, both, private, and, public, spheres, while, past, court, considerations, often, focused, on, hopes, arising, from, legal, disputes, and, everyday, life, the, current, predominant, topic, of, discussion, centers, around, the, hope, of, incarcerated, individuals, seeking, release, see, for, instance, graham, v, florida, 560, u, s, 48, 52, 2010, riofrio, s, examination, delves, not, only, into, specific, expressions, of, the, right, to, hope, but, also, into, the, right, to, hope, itself, as, a, comprehensive, concept, in, this, exploration, he, draws, connections, between, numerous, legal, doctrines, addressing, everyday, hopes, such, as, the, doctrines, of, legitimate, expectations, and, loss, of, a, chance, drawing, insights, from, extensive, case, law, explicitly, referencing, the, right, to, hope, international, legal, precedents, philosophical, teachings, from, eminent, scholars, and, certain, theological, arguments, riofrio, concludes, that, the, unenumerated, right, to, hope, encompasses, four, essential, elements, hope, is, the, thing, with, feathers, that, perches, in, the, soul, and, sings, the, tune, without, the, words, and, never, stops, at, all, a, classic, reference, to, hope, which, has, entered, modern, language, is, the, concept, that, hope, springs, eternal, taken, from, alexander, pope, s, essay, on, man, the, phrase, reading, hope, springs, eternal, in, the, human, breast, man, never, is, but, always, to, be, blest, another, popular, reference, hope, is, the, thing, with, feathers, is, from, a, poem, by, emily, dickinson, hope, can, be, used, as, an, artistic, plot, device, and, is, often, a, motivating, force, for, change, in, dynamic, characters, a, commonly, understood, reference, from, western, popular, culture, is, the, subtitle, a, new, hope, from, the, original, first, installment, now, considered, episode, iv, in, the, star, wars, science, fiction, space, opera, the, subtitle, refers, to, one, of, the, lead, characters, luke, skywalker, who, is, expected, in, the, future, to, allow, good, to, triumph, over, evil, within, the, plot, of, the, films, the, swallow, has, been, a, symbol, of, hope, in, aesop, s, fables, and, numerous, other, historic, literature, it, symbolizes, hope, in, part, because, it, is, among, the, first, birds, to, appear, at, the, end, of, winter, and, the, start, of, spring, other, symbols, of, hope, include, the, anchor, and, the, dove, nietzsche, took, a, contrarian, but, coherent, view, of, hope, zeus, did, not, wish, man, however, much, he, might, be, tormented, by, the, other, evils, to, fling, away, his, life, but, to, go, on, letting, himself, be, tormented, again, and, again, therefore, he, gives, man, hope, in, reality, it, is, the, worst, of, all, evils, because, it, prolongs, the, torments, of, man, elpis, hope, appears, in, ancient, greek, mythology, with, the, story, of, zeus, and, prometheus, prometheus, stole, fire, from, the, god, zeus, which, infuriated, the, supreme, god, in, turn, zeus, created, a, box, that, contained, all, manners, of, evil, unbeknownst, to, the, receiver, of, the, box, pandora, opened, the, box, after, being, warned, not, to, and, unleashed, a, multitude, of, harmful, spirits, that, inflicted, plagues, diseases, and, illnesses, on, mankind, spirits, of, greed, envy, hatred, mistrust, sorrow, anger, revenge, lust, and, despair, scattered, far, and, wide, looking, for, humans, to, torment, inside, the, box, however, there, was, also, an, unreleased, healing, spirit, named, hope, from, ancient, times, people, have, recognized, that, a, spirit, of, hope, had, the, power, to, heal, afflictions, and, helps, them, bear, times, of, great, suffering, illnesses, disasters, loss, and, pain, caused, by, the, malevolent, spirits, and, events, in, hesiod, s, works, and, days, the, personification, of, hope, is, named, elpis, norse, mythology, however, considered, hope, v, n, to, be, the, slobber, dripping, from, the, mouth, of, fenris, wolf, their, concept, of, courage, rated, most, highly, a, cheerful, bravery, in, the, absence, of, hope, hope, is, a, key, concept, in, most, major, world, religions, often, signifying, the, hoper, believes, an, individual, or, a, collective, group, will, reach, a, concept, of, heaven, depending, on, the, religion, hope, can, be, seen, as, a, prerequisite, for, and, or, byproduct, of, spiritual, attainment, the, jewish, encyclopedia, notes, ti, wah, and, seber, as, terms, for, hope, adding, that, mi, weh, and, kislah, denote, the, related, concept, of,
