punishment, commonly, is, the, imposition, of, painful, consequences, upon, an, individual, or, group, meted, out, by, an, authority, in, contexts, ranging, from, child, discipline, to, criminal, law, as, a, deterrent, to, a, particular, action, or, behavior, that, is, deemed, undesirable, it, is, however, possible, to, distinguish, between, various, different, understandings, of, what, punishment, is, the, reasoning, for, punishment, may, be, to, condition, a, child, to, avoid, self, endangerment, to, impose, social, conformity, in, particular, in, the, contexts, of, compulsory, education, or, military, discipline, to, defend, norms, to, protect, against, future, harms, in, particular, those, from, violent, crime, and, to, maintain, the, law, and, respect, for, rule, of, law, under, which, the, social, group, is, governed, punishment, may, be, self, inflicted, as, with, self, flagellation, and, mortification, of, the, flesh, in, the, religious, setting, but, is, most, often, a, form, of, social, coercion, the, unpleasant, imposition, may, include, a, fine, penalty, or, confinement, or, be, the, removal, or, denial, of, something, pleasant, or, desirable, the, individual, may, be, a, person, or, even, an, animal, the, authority, may, be, either, a, group, or, a, single, person, and, punishment, may, be, carried, out, formally, under, a, system, of, law, or, informally, in, other, kinds, of, social, settings, such, as, within, a, family, negative, or, unpleasant, impositions, that, are, not, authorized, or, that, are, administered, without, a, breach, of, rules, are, not, considered, to, be, punishment, as, defined, here, the, study, and, practice, of, the, punishment, of, crimes, particularly, as, it, applies, to, imprisonment, is, called, penology, or, often, in, modern, texts, corrections, in, this, context, the, punishment, process, is, euphemistically, called, correctional, process, research, into, punishment, often, includes, similar, research, into, prevention, justifications, for, punishment, include, retribution, deterrence, rehabilitation, and, incapacitation, the, last, could, include, such, measures, as, isolation, in, order, to, prevent, the, wrongdoer, s, having, contact, with, potential, victims, or, the, removal, of, a, hand, in, order, to, make, theft, more, difficult, if, only, some, of, the, conditions, included, in, the, definition, of, punishment, are, present, descriptions, other, than, punishment, may, be, considered, more, accurate, inflicting, something, negative, or, unpleasant, on, a, person, or, animal, without, authority, or, not, on, the, basis, of, a, breach, of, rules, is, typically, considered, only, revenge, or, spite, rather, than, punishment, in, addition, the, word, punishment, is, used, as, a, metaphor, as, when, a, boxer, experiences, punishment, during, a, fight, in, other, situations, breaking, a, rule, may, be, rewarded, and, so, receiving, such, a, reward, naturally, does, not, constitute, punishment, finally, the, condition, of, breaking, or, breaching, the, rules, must, be, satisfied, for, consequences, to, be, considered, punishment, punishments, differ, in, their, degree, of, severity, and, may, include, sanctions, such, as, reprimands, deprivations, of, privileges, or, liberty, fines, incarcerations, ostracism, the, infliction, of, pain, amputation, and, the, death, penalty, corporal, punishment, refers, to, punishments, in, which, physical, pain, is, intended, to, be, inflicted, upon, the, transgressor, punishments, may, be, judged, as, fair, or, unfair, in, terms, of, their, degree, of, reciprocity, and, proportionality, to, the, offense, punishment, can, be, an, integral, part, of, socialization, and, punishing, unwanted, behavior, is, often, part, of, a, system, of, pedagogy, or, behavioral, modification, which, also, includes, rewards, there, are, a, large, number, of, different, understandings, of, what, punishment, is, various, philosophers, have, presented, definitions, of, punishment, conditions, commonly, considered, necessary, properly, to, describe, an, action, as, punishment, are, that, introduced, by, b, f, skinner, punishment, has, a, more, restrictive, and, technical, definition, along, with, reinforcement, it, belongs, under, the, operant, conditioning, category, operant, conditioning, refers, to, learning, with, either, punishment, often, confused, as, negative, reinforcement, or, a, reward, that, serves, as, a, positive, reinforcement, of, the, lesson, to, be, learned, in, psychology, punishment, is, the, reduction, of, a, behavior, via, application, of, an, unpleasant, stimulus, positive, punishment, or, removal, of, a, pleasant, stimulus, negative, punishment, extra, chores, or, spanking, are, examples, of, positive, punishment, while, removing, an, offending, student, s, recess, or, play, privileges, are, examples, of, negative, punishment, the, definition, requires, that, punishment, is, only, determined, after, the, fact, by, the, reduction, in, behavior, if, the, offending, behavior, of, the, subject, does, not, decrease, it, is, not, considered, punishment, there, is, some, conflation, of, punishment, and, aversives, though, an, aversion, that, does, not, decrease, behavior, is, not, considered, punishment, in, psychology, additionally, aversive, stimulus, is, a, label, behaviorists, generally, apply, to, negative, reinforcers, as, in, avoidance, learning, rather, than, the, punishers, punishment, is, sometimes, called, retaliatory, or, moralistic, aggression, it, has, been, observed, in, all, species, of, social, animals, leading, evolutionary, biologists, to, conclude, that, it, is, an, evolutionarily, stable, strategy, selected, because, it, favors, cooperative, behavior, however, other, evolutionary, biologists, have, argued, against, punishment, to, favour, cooperation, dreber, et, al, demonstrate, that, while, the, availability, of, costly, punishment, can, enhance, cooperative, behavior, it, does, not, improve, the, group, s, average, payoff, additionally, there, is, a, significant, negative, relationship, between, the, overall, payoff, and, the, employment, of, costly, punishment, individuals, who, achieve, the, highest, total, payoffs, generally, avoid, using, costly, punishment, this, indicates, that, employing, costly, punishment, in, cooperative, games, may, be, disadvantageous, and, suggests, that, it, may, have, evolved, for, purposes, other, than, promoting, cooperation, achieving, a, certain, proportion, of, trust, in, the, population, can, lead, to, self, governance, without, the, need, for, punishment, there, are, also, arguments, against, the, notion, of, punishment, requiring, intelligence, based, on, studies, of, punishment, in, very, small, brained, animals, such, as, insects, there, is, proof, of, honey, bee, workers, with, mutations, that, makes, them, fertile, laying, eggs, only, when, other, honey, bees, are, not, observing, them, and, that, the, few, that, are, caught, in, the, act, are, killed, this, is, corroborated, by, computer, simulations, proving, that, a, few, simple, reactions, well, within, mainstream, views, of, the, extremely, limited, intelligence, of, insects, are, sufficient, to, emulate, the, political, behavior, observed, in, great, apes, the, authors, argue, that, this, falsifies, the, claim, that, punishment, evolved, as, a, strategy, to, deal, with, individuals, capable, of, knowing, what, they, are, doing, in, the, case, of, more, complex, brains, the, notion, of, evolution, selecting, for, specific, punishment, of, intentionally, chosen, breaches, of, rules, and, or, wrongdoers, capable, of, intentional, choices, for, example, punishing, humans, for, murder, while, not, punishing, lethal, viruses, is, subject, to, criticism, from, coevolution, issues, that, punishment, of, individuals, with, certain, characteristics, including, but, in, principle, not, restricted, to, mental, abilities, selects, against, those, characteristics, making, evolution, of, any, mental, abilities, considered, to, be, the, basis, for, penal, responsibility, impossible, in, populations, subject, to, such, selective, punishment, certain, scientists, argue, that, this, disproves, the, notion, of, humans, having, a, biological, feeling, of, intentional, transgressions, deserving, to, be, punished, punishments, are, applied, for, various, purposes, most, generally, to, encourage, and, enforce, proper, behavior, as, defined, by, society, or, family, criminals, are, punished, judicially, by, fines, corporal, punishment, or, custodial, sentences, such, as, prison, detainees, risk, further, punishments, for, breaches, of, internal, rules, children, pupils, and, other, trainees, may, be, punished, by, their, educators, or, instructors, mainly, parents, guardians, or, teachers, tutors, and, coaches, see, child, discipline, slaves, domestic, and, other, servants, were, subject, to, punishment, by, their, masters, employees, can, still, be, subject, to, a, contractual, form, of, fine, or, demotion, most, hierarchical, organizations, such, as, military, and, police, forces, or, even, churches, still, apply, quite, rigid, internal, discipline, even, with, a, judicial, system, of, their, own, court, martial, canonical, courts, punishment, may, also, be, applied, on, moral, especially, religious, grounds, as, in, penance, which, is, voluntary, or, imposed, in, a, theocracy, with, a, religious, police, as, in, a, strict, islamic, state, like, iran, or, under, the, taliban, or, though, not, a, true, theocracy, by, inquisition, belief, that, an, individual, s, ultimate, punishment, is, being, sent, by, god, the, highest, authority, to, an, existence, in, hell, a, place, believed, to, exist, in, the, after, life, typically, corresponds, to, sins, committed, during, their, life, sometimes, these, distinctions, are, specific, with, damned, souls, suffering, for, each, sin, committed, see, for, example, plato, s, myth, of, er, or, dante, s, the, divine, comedy, but, sometimes, they, are, general, with, condemned, sinners, relegated, to, one, or, more, chamber, of, hell, or, to, a, level, of, suffering, a, principle, often, mentioned, with, respect, to, the, degree, of, punishment, to, be, meted, out, is, that, the, punishment, should, match, the, crime, one, standard, for, measurement, is, the, degree, to, which, a, crime, affects, others, or, society, measurements, of, the, degree, of, seriousness, of, a, crime, have, been, developed, a, felony, is, generally, considered, to, be, a, crime, of, high, seriousness, while, a, misdemeanor, is, not, there, are, many, possible, reasons, that, might, be, given, to, justify, or, explain, why, someone, ought, to, be, punished, here, follows, a, broad, outline, of, typical, possibly, conflicting, justifications, two, reasons, given, to, justify, punishment, is, that, it, is, a, measure, to, prevent, people, from, committing, an, offence, deterring, previous, offenders, from, re, offending, and, preventing, those, who, may, be, contemplating, an, offence, they, have, not, committed, from, actually, committing, it, this, punishment, is, intended, to, be, sufficient, that, people, would, choose, not, to, commit, the, crime, rather, than, experience, the, punishment, the, aim, is, to, deter, everyone, in, the, community, from, committing, offences, some, criminologists, state, that, the, number, of, people, convicted, for, crime, does, not, decrease, as, a, result, of, more, severe, punishment, and, conclude, that, deterrence, is, ineffective, other, criminologists, object, to, said, conclusion, citing, that, while, most, people, do, not, know, the, exact, severity, of, punishment, such, as, whether, the, sentence, for, murder, is, 40, years, or, life, most, people, still, know, the, rough, outlines, such, as, the, punishments, for, armed, robbery, or, forcible, rape, being, more, severe, than, the, punishments, for, driving, too, fast, or, misparking, a, car, these, criminologists, therefore, argue, that, lack, of, deterring, effect, of, increasing, the, sentences, for, already, severely, punished, crimes, say, nothing, about, the, significance, of, the, existence, of, punishment, as, a, deterring, factor, some, criminologists, argue, that, increasing, the, sentences, for, crimes, can, cause, criminal, investigators, to, give, higher, priority, to, said, crimes, so, that, a, higher, percentage, of, those, committing, them, are, convicted, for, them, causing, statistics, to, give, a, false, appearance, of, such, crimes, increasing, these, criminologists, argue, that, the, use, of, statistics, to, gauge, the, efficiency, of, crime, fighting, methods, are, a, danger, of, creating, a, reward, hack, that, makes, the, least, efficient, criminal, justice, systems, appear, to, be, best, at, fighting, crime, and, that, the, appearance, of, deterrence, being, ineffective, may, be, an, example, of, this, some, punishment, includes, work, to, reform, and, rehabilitate, the, culprit, so, that, they, will, not, commit, the, offence, again, this, is, distinguished, from, deterrence, in, that, the, goal, here, is, to, change, the, offender, s, attitude, to, what, they, have, done, and, make, them, come, to, see, that, their, behavior, was, wrong, incapacitation, as, a, justification, of, punishment, refers, to, the, offender, s, ability, to, commit, further, offences, being, removed, imprisonment, separates, offenders, from, the, community, for, example, australia, was, a, dumping, ground, for, early, british, criminals, this, was, their, way, of, removing, or, reducing, the, offenders, ability, to, carry, out, certain, crimes, the, death, penalty, does, this, in, a, permanent, and, irrevocable, way, in, some, societies, people, who, stole, have, been, punished, by, having, their, hands, amputated, crewe, however, has, pointed, out, that, for, incapacitation, of, an, offender, to, work, it, must, be, the, case, that, the, offender, would, have, committed, a, crime, had, they, not, been, restricted, in, this, way, should, the, putative, offender, not, be, going, to, commit, further, crimes, then, they, have, not, been, incapacitated, the, more, heinous, crimes, such, as, murders, have, the, lowest, levels, of, recidivism, and, hence, are, the, least, likely, offences, to, be, subject, to, incapacitative, effects, antisocial, behaviour, and, the, like, display, high, levels, of, recidivism, and, hence, are, the, kind, of, crimes, most, susceptible, to, incapacitative, effects, it, is, shown, by, life, course, studies, that, long, sentences, for, burglaries, amongst, offenders, in, their, late, teens, and, early, twenties, fail, to, incapacitate, when, the, natural, reduction, in, offending, due, to, ageing, is, taken, into, account, the, longer, the, sentence, in, these, cases, the, less, the, incapacitative, effect, criminal, activities, typically, give, a, benefit, to, the, offender, and, a, loss, to, the, victim, punishment, has, been, justified, as, a, measure, of, retributive, justice, in, which, the, goal, is, to, try, to, rebalance, any, unjust, advantage, gained, by, ensuring, that, the, offender, also, suffers, a, loss, sometimes, viewed, as, a, way, of, getting, even, with, a, wrongdoer, the, suffering, of, the, wrongdoer, is, seen, as, a, desired, goal, in, itself, even, if, it, has, no, restorative, benefits, for, the, victim, one, reason, societies, have, administered, punishments, is, to, diminish, the, perceived, need, for, retaliatory, street, justice, blood, feud, and, vigilantism, especially, applied, to, minor, offenses, punishment, may, take, the, form, of, the, offender, righting, the, wrong, or, making, restitution, to, the, victim, community, service, or, compensation, orders, are, examples, of, this, sort, of, penalty, in, models, of, restorative, justice, victims, take, an, active, role, in, a, process, with, their, offenders, who, are, encouraged, to, take, responsibility, for, their, actions, to, repair, the, harm, they, ve, done, by, apologizing, returning, stolen, money, or, community, service, the, restorative, justice, approach, aims, to, help, the, offender, want, to, avoid, future, offences, punishment, can, be, explained, by, positive, prevention, theory, to, use, the, criminal, justice, system, to, teach, people, what, are, the, social, norms, for, what, is, correct, and, acts, as, a, reinforcement, punishment, can, serve, as, a, means, for, society, to, publicly, express, denunciation, of, an, action, as, being, criminal, besides, educating, people, regarding, what, is, not, acceptable, behavior, it, serves, the, dual, function, of, preventing, vigilante, justice, by, acknowledging, public, anger, while, concurrently, deterring, future, criminal, activity, by, stigmatizing, the, offender, this, is, sometimes, called, the, expressive, theory, of, denunciation, the, pillory, was, a, method, for, carrying, out, public, denunciation, some, critics, of, the, education, and, denunciation, model, cite, evolutionary, problems, with, the, notion, that, a, feeling, for, punishment, as, a, social, signal, system, evolved, if, punishment, was, not, effective, the, critics, argue, that, some, individuals, spending, time, and, energy, and, taking, risks, in, punishing, others, and, the, possible, loss, of, the, punished, group, members, would, have, been, selected, against, if, punishment, served, no, function, other, than, signals, that, could, evolve, to, work, by, less, risky, means, a, unified, theory, of, punishment, brings, together, multiple, penal, purposes, such, as, retribution, deterrence, and, rehabilitation, in, a, single, coherent, framework, instead, of, punishment, requiring, we, choose, between, them, unified, theorists, argue, that, they, work, together, as, part, of, some, wider, goal, such, as, the, protection, of, rights, some, people, think, that, punishment, as, a, whole, is, unhelpful, and, even, harmful, to, the, people, that, it, is, used, against, detractors, argue, that, punishment, is, simply, wrong, of, the, same, design, as, two, wrongs, make, a, right, critics, argue, that, punishment, is, simply, revenge, professor, deirdre, golash, author, of, the, case, against, punishment, retribution, crime, prevention, and, the, law, says, we, ought, not, to, impose, such, harm, on, anyone, unless, we, have, a, very, good, reason, for, doing, so, this, remark, may, seem, trivially, true, but, the, history, of, humankind, is, littered, with, examples, of, the, deliberate, infliction, of, harm, by, well, intentioned, persons, in, the, vain, pursuit, of, ends, which, that, harm, did, not, further, or, in, the, successful, pursuit, of, questionable, ends, these, benefactors, of, humanity, sacrificed, their, fellows, to, appease, mythical, gods, and, tortured, them, to, save, their, souls, from, a, mythical, hell, broke, and, bound, the, feet, of, children, to, promote, their, eventual, marriageability, beat, slow, schoolchildren, to, promote, learning, and, respect, for, teachers, subjected, the, sick, to, leeches, to, rid, them, of, excess, blood, and, put, suspects, to, the, rack, and, the, thumbscrew, in, the, service, of, truth, they, schooled, themselves, to, feel, no, pity, to, renounce, human, compassion, in, the, service, of, a, higher, end, the, deliberate, doing, of, harm, in, the, mistaken, belief, that, it, promotes, some, greater, good, is, the, essence, of, tragedy, we, would, do, well, to, ask, whether, the, goods, we, seek, in, harming, offenders, are, worthwhile, and, whether, the, means, we, choose, will, indeed, secure, them, golash, also, writes, about, imprisonment, imprisonment, means, at, minimum, the, loss, of, liberty, and, autonomy, as, well, as, many, material, comforts, personal, security, and, access, to, heterosexual, relations, these, deprivations, according, to, gresham, sykes, who, first, identified, them, together, dealt, a, profound, hurt, that, went, to, the, very, foundations, of, the, prisoner, s, being, but, these, are, only, the, minimum, harms, suffered, by, the, least, vulnerable, inmates, in, the, best, run, prisons, most, prisons, are, run, badly, and, in, some, conditions, are, more, squalid, than, in, the, worst, of, slums, in, the, district, of, columbia, jail, for, example, inmates, must, wash, their, clothes, and, sheets, in, cell, toilets, because, the, laundry, machines, are, broken, vermin, and, insects, infest, the, building, in, which, air, vents, are, clogged, with, decades, accumulation, of, dust, and, grime, but, even, inmates, in, prisons, where, conditions, are, sanitary, must, still, face, the, numbing, boredom, and, emptiness, of, prison, life, a, vast, desert, of, wasted, days, in, which, little, in, the, way, of, meaningful, activity, is, possible, there, are, critics, of, punishment, who, argue, that, punishment, aimed, at, intentional, actions, forces, people, to, suppress, their, ability, to, act, on, intent, advocates, of, this, viewpoint, argue, that, such, suppression, of, intention, causes, the, harmful, behaviors, to, remain, making, punishment, counterproductive, these, people, suggest, that, the, ability, to, make, intentional, choices, should, instead, be, treasured, as, a, source, of, possibilities, of, betterment, citing, that, complex, cognition, would, have, been, an, evolutionarily, useless, waste, of, energy, if, it, led, to, justifications, of, fixed, actions, and, no, change, as, simple, inability, to, understand, arguments, would, have, been, the, most, thrifty, protection, from, being, misled, by, them, if, arguments, were, for, social, manipulation, and, reject, condemnation, of, people, who, intentionally, did, bad, things, punishment, can, be, effective, in, stopping, undesirable, employee, behaviors, such, as, tardiness, absenteeism, or, substandard, work, performance, however, punishment, does, not, necessarily, cause, an, employee, to, demonstrate, a, desirable, behavior
