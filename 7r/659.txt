list, of, forms, of, government, a, confederation, also, known, as, a, confederacy, or, league, is, a, political, union, of, sovereign, states, united, for, purposes, of, common, action, usually, created, by, a, treaty, confederations, of, states, tend, to, be, established, for, dealing, with, critical, issues, such, as, defence, foreign, relations, internal, trade, or, currency, with, the, central, government, being, required, to, provide, support, for, all, its, members, confederalism, represents, a, main, form, of, intergovernmentalism, defined, as, any, form, of, interaction, around, states, that, takes, place, on, the, basis, of, sovereign, independence, or, government, the, nature, of, the, relationship, among, the, member, states, constituting, a, confederation, varies, considerably, likewise, the, relationship, between, the, member, states, and, the, general, government, and, their, distribution, of, powers, varies, some, looser, confederations, are, similar, to, international, organisations, other, confederations, with, stricter, rules, may, resemble, federal, systems, these, elements, of, such, confederations, the, international, organization, and, federalist, perspective, has, been, combined, as, supranational, unions, since, the, member, states, of, a, confederation, retain, their, sovereignty, they, have, an, implicit, right, of, secession, the, political, philosopher, emmerich, de, vattel, said, several, sovereign, and, independent, states, may, unite, themselves, together, by, a, perpetual, confederacy, without, each, in, particular, ceasing, to, be, a, perfect, state, the, deliberations, in, common, will, offer, no, violence, to, the, sovereignty, of, each, member, under, a, confederation, compared, to, a, federal, state, the, central, authority, is, relatively, weak, decisions, made, by, the, general, government, in, a, unicameral, legislature, a, council, of, the, member, states, require, subsequent, implementation, by, the, member, states, to, take, effect, they, are, not, laws, acting, directly, upon, the, individual, but, have, more, the, character, of, interstate, agreements, also, decision, making, in, the, general, government, usually, proceeds, by, consensus, unanimity, not, by, the, majority, historically, those, features, limit, the, union, s, effectiveness, hence, political, pressure, tends, to, build, over, time, for, the, transition, to, a, federal, system, of, government, as, in, the, american, swiss, and, german, cases, of, regional, integration, in, terms, of, internal, structure, every, confederal, state, is, composed, of, two, or, more, constituent, states, referred, to, as, confederated, states, regarding, their, political, systems, confederated, states, can, have, republican, or, monarchical, forms, of, government, those, that, have, a, republican, form, confederated, republics, are, usually, called, states, like, states, of, the, american, confederacy, 1861, 1865, or, republics, like, republics, of, serbia, and, montenegro, within, the, former, state, union, of, serbia, and, montenegro, 2003, 2006, those, that, have, a, monarchical, form, of, government, confederated, monarchies, are, defined, by, various, hierarchical, ranks, like, kingdoms, of, iraq, and, jordan, within, the, hashemite, arab, union, in, 1958, many, scholars, have, claimed, that, the, kingdom, of, belgium, a, country, with, a, complicated, federal, structure, has, adopted, some, characteristics, of, a, confederation, under, the, pressure, of, separatist, movements, especially, in, flanders, for, example, c, e, lagasse, declared, that, belgium, was, near, the, political, system, of, a, confederation, regarding, the, constitutional, reform, agreements, between, belgian, regions, and, between, communities, and, the, director, of, the, centre, de, recherche, et, d, information, socio, politiques, crisp, vincent, de, coorebyter, called, belgium, undoubtedly, a, federation, some, aspects, of, a, confederation, in, le, soir, also, in, le, soir, michel, qu, vit, of, the, catholic, university, of, louvain, wrote, that, the, belgian, political, system, is, already, in, dynamics, of, a, confederation, nevertheless, the, belgian, regions, and, the, linguistic, communities, do, not, have, the, autonomy, to, leave, the, belgian, state, as, such, federal, aspects, still, dominate, also, for, fiscal, policy, and, public, finances, the, federal, state, dominates, the, other, levels, of, government, the, increasingly, confederal, aspects, of, the, belgian, federal, state, appear, to, be, a, political, reflection, of, the, profound, cultural, sociological, and, economic, differences, between, the, flemish, belgians, who, speak, dutch, or, dutch, dialects, and, the, walloons, belgians, who, speak, french, or, french, dialects, for, example, in, the, last, several, decades, over, 95, of, belgians, have, voted, for, political, parties, that, represent, voters, from, only, one, community, the, separatist, n, va, being, the, party, with, the, most, voter, support, among, the, flemish, population, parties, that, strongly, advocate, belgian, unity, and, appeal, to, voters, of, both, communities, usually, play, only, a, marginal, role, in, nationwide, general, elections, the, system, in, belgium, is, known, as, consociationalism, that, makes, belgium, fundamentally, different, from, federal, countries, like, switzerland, canada, germany, and, australia, national, parties, receive, over, 90, of, voter, support, in, those, countries, the, only, geographical, areas, comparable, with, belgium, within, europe, are, catalonia, the, basque, country, both, part, of, spain, northern, ireland, and, scotland, both, part, of, the, united, kingdom, and, parts, of, italy, where, a, massive, voter, turnout, for, regional, and, often, separatist, political, parties, has, become, the, rule, in, the, last, decades, and, nationwide, parties, advocating, national, unity, draw, around, half, or, sometimes, less, of, the, votes, the, benelux, is, a, politico, economic, union, of, the, states, of, belgium, the, netherlands, and, luxembourg, bound, through, treaties, and, based, on, consensus, between, the, representatives, of, the, member, states, they, partially, share, a, common, foreign, policy, especially, in, regards, to, their, navies, through, the, benesam, the, dutch, defence, minister, 2010, 2012, hans, hillen, even, said, on, belgian, radio, that, it, is, not, impossible, that, the, three, armed, forces, of, the, member, states, could, be, integrated, into, benelux, armed, forces, one, day, because, of, this, the, benelux, is, sometimes, labeled, as, a, kind, of, confederation, by, for, example, belgian, minister, of, state, mark, eyskens, canada, is, an, unusually, decentralized, federal, state, not, a, confederate, association, of, sovereign, states, the, usual, meaning, of, confederation, in, modern, terms, in, canada, the, word, confederation, has, an, additional, unrelated, meaning, confederation, refers, to, the, process, of, or, the, event, of, establishing, or, joining, the, canadian, federal, state, in, modern, terminology, canada, is, a, federation, not, a, confederation, however, to, contemporaries, of, the, constitution, act, 1867, confederation, did, not, have, the, same, connotation, of, a, weakly, centralized, federation, canadian, confederation, generally, refers, to, the, constitution, act, 1867, which, formed, the, dominion, of, canada, from, three, of, the, colonies, of, british, north, america, and, to, the, subsequent, incorporation, of, other, colonies, and, territories, beginning, on, 1, july, 1867, it, was, initially, a, self, governing, dominion, of, the, british, empire, with, a, federal, structure, whose, government, was, led, by, sir, john, a, macdonald, the, initial, colonies, involved, were, the, province, of, canada, becoming, quebec, from, canada, east, formerly, the, colony, of, lower, canada, and, ontario, from, canada, west, formerly, the, colony, of, upper, canada, nova, scotia, and, new, brunswick, later, participants, were, manitoba, british, columbia, prince, edward, island, alberta, and, saskatchewan, the, latter, two, created, in, 1905, as, federated, provinces, from, parts, of, the, directly, federally, administered, northwest, territories, first, transferred, to, the, dominion, in, 1869, and, now, possessing, devolved, governments, as, itself, yukon, and, nunavut, and, finally, newfoundland, now, newfoundland, and, labrador, in, 1949, a, canadian, judicial, constitutional, interpretation, reference, re, secession, of, quebec, and, a, subsequent, federal, law, set, forth, negotiating, conditions, for, a, canadian, province, though, not, a, territory, to, leave, the, canadian, federal, state, addressed, also, by, a, related, quebec, law, importantly, negotiation, would, first, need, triggering, by, referendum, and, executing, by, constitutional, amendment, using, a, current, amending, mechanism, of, canada, s, constitution, meaning, that, while, not, legal, under, the, current, constitution, it, is, democratically, feasible, without, resorting, to, extralegal, means, or, international, involvement, its, unique, nature, and, the, political, sensitivities, surrounding, it, cause, there, to, be, no, common, or, legal, classification, for, the, european, union, eu, however, it, bears, some, resemblance, to, both, a, confederation, or, a, new, type, of, confederation, and, a, federation, the, term, supranational, union, has, also, been, applied, the, eu, operates, common, economic, policies, with, hundreds, of, common, laws, which, enable, a, single, economic, market, a, common, customs, territory, mainly, open, internal, borders, and, a, common, currency, among, most, member, states, however, unlike, a, federation, the, eu, does, not, have, exclusive, powers, over, foreign, affairs, defence, taxation, along, with, the, immigration, and, transit, of, non, eu, nationals, furthermore, most, eu, laws, which, have, been, developed, by, consensus, between, relevant, national, government, ministers, and, then, scrutinised, and, approved, or, rejected, by, the, european, parliament, must, be, transposed, into, national, law, by, national, parliaments, most, collective, decisions, by, member, states, are, taken, by, weighted, majorities, and, blocking, minorities, typical, of, upper, houses, in, federations, on, the, other, hand, the, absolute, unanimity, typical, of, intergovernmentalism, is, required, only, in, respect, to, the, common, foreign, and, security, policy, as, well, as, in, situations, when, ratification, of, a, treaty, or, of, a, treaty, amendment, is, required, such, a, form, may, thus, be, described, as, a, semi, intergovernmental, confederation, however, some, academic, observers, more, usually, discuss, the, eu, in, the, terms, of, it, being, a, federation, as, the, international, law, professor, joseph, h, h, weiler, of, the, hague, academy, and, new, york, university, wrote, europe, has, charted, its, own, brand, of, constitutional, federalism, jean, michel, josselin, and, alain, marciano, see, the, european, court, of, justice, in, luxembourg, city, as, being, a, primary, force, behind, the, building, of, a, federal, legal, order, for, the, eu, with, josselin, stating, that, a, complete, shift, from, a, confederation, to, a, federation, would, have, required, to, straight, forwardly, replace, the, principality, of, the, member, states, vis, vis, the, union, by, that, of, the, european, citizens, as, a, consequence, both, confederate, and, federate, features, coexist, in, the, judicial, landscape, rutgers, political, science, professor, r, daniel, kelemen, said, those, uncomfortable, using, the, f, word, in, the, eu, context, should, feel, free, to, refer, to, it, as, a, quasi, federal, or, federal, like, system, nevertheless, the, eu, has, the, necessary, attributes, of, a, federal, system, it, is, striking, that, while, many, scholars, of, the, eu, continue, to, resist, analyzing, it, as, a, federation, most, contemporary, students, of, federalism, view, the, eu, as, a, federal, system, thomas, risse, and, tanja, a, b, rzel, claim, that, the, eu, only, lacks, two, significant, features, of, a, federation, first, the, member, states, remain, the, masters, of, the, treaties, i, e, they, have, the, exclusive, power, to, amend, or, change, the, constitutive, treaties, of, the, eu, second, the, eu, lacks, a, real, tax, and, spend, capacity, in, other, words, there, is, no, fiscal, federalism, val, ry, giscard, d, estaing, the, chairman, of, the, body, of, experts, commissioned, to, elaborate, a, constitutional, charter, for, the, european, union, was, confronted, with, strong, opposition, from, the, united, kingdom, towards, including, the, words, federal, or, federation, in, the, unratified, european, constitution, and, the, word, was, replaced, with, either, community, or, union, a, majority, of, the, political, groups, in, the, european, parliament, including, the, epp, the, s, d, group, and, renew, europe, support, a, federal, model, for, the, european, union, the, ecr, group, argues, for, a, reformed, european, union, along, confederal, lines, the, brothers, of, italy, party, led, by, giorgia, meloni, campaigns, for, a, confederal, europe, on, her, election, as, president, of, the, ecr, party, in, september, 2020, meloni, said, let, us, continue, to, fight, together, for, a, confederate, europe, of, free, and, sovereign, states, in, the, context, of, the, history, of, the, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, a, confederacy, may, refer, to, a, semi, permanent, political, and, military, alliance, consisting, of, multiple, nations, or, tribes, bands, or, villages, which, maintained, their, separate, leadership, one, of, the, most, well, known, is, the, haudenosaunee, or, iroquois, but, there, were, many, others, during, different, eras, and, locations, across, north, america, such, as, the, wabanaki, confederacy, western, confederacy, tsenacommacah, seven, nations, of, canada, pontiac, s, confederacy, pennacook, confederacy, illinois, confederation, tecumseh, s, confederacy, muscogee, confederacy, great, sioux, nation, blackfoot, confederacy, warm, springs, confederacy, manahoac, confederacy, iron, confederacy, and, council, of, three, fires, the, haudenosaunee, confederacy, historically, known, as, the, iroquois, league, or, the, league, of, five, later, six, nations, is, the, country, of, native, americans, in, what, is, now, the, united, states, and, first, nations, in, what, is, now, canada, that, consists, of, six, nations, the, mohawk, the, oneida, the, onondaga, the, cayuga, the, seneca, and, the, tuscarora, the, six, nations, have, a, representative, government, known, as, the, grand, council, which, is, the, oldest, governmental, institution, still, maintaining, its, original, form, in, north, america, each, clan, from, the, five, nations, sends, chiefs, to, act, as, representatives, and, make, decisions, for, the, whole, confederation, it, has, been, operating, since, its, foundation, in, 1142, despite, limited, international, recognition, today, several, of, the, pre, columbian, cultures, of, colombia, such, as, the, muisca, and, tairona, were, composed, of, loose, confederations, the, muisca, form, of, government, consisted, of, two, different, rulers, that, governed, a, region, in, the, central, andean, highlands, in, present, day, colombia, the, hoa, ruled, the, northern, section, of, the, confederation, while, the, zipa, ruled, the, southern, portion, the, andean, civilizations, consisted, of, loose, confederations, such, as, the, aymara, kingdoms, and, the, diaguita, with, the, former, being, composed, of, distinct, diarchies, in, 2003, federal, republic, of, yugoslavia, was, transformed, into, the, state, union, of, serbia, and, montenegro, a, confederation, of, the, republic, of, montenegro, and, the, republic, of, serbia, the, state, was, constituted, as, a, loose, political, union, but, formally, functioned, as, a, sovereign, subject, of, international, law, and, member, of, the, united, nations, as, a, confederation, the, state, union, of, serbia, and, montenegro, had, very, few, shared, functions, such, as, defense, foreign, affairs, and, a, weak, common, president, ministerial, council, and, parliament, the, two, constituent, republics, functioned, separately, throughout, the, period, of, its, short, existence, and, they, continued, to, operate, under, separate, economic, policies, and, to, use, separate, currencies, the, euro, was, and, still, is, the, only, legal, tender, in, montenegro, and, the, dinar, was, and, still, is, the, legal, tender, in, serbia, on, 21, may, 2006, the, montenegrin, independence, referendum, was, held, the, final, official, results, indicated, on, 31, may, that, 55, 5, of, voters, voted, in, favor, of, independence, the, confederation, effectively, came, to, an, end, after, montenegro, s, formal, declaration, of, independence, on, 3, june, 2006, and, serbia, s, formal, declaration, of, independence, on, 5, june, switzerland, officially, known, as, the, swiss, confederation, is, an, example, of, a, modern, country, that, traditionally, refers, to, itself, as, a, confederation, because, the, official, and, traditional, name, of, switzerland, in, german, the, majority, language, of, the, swiss, is, schweizerische, eidgenossenschaft, literally, swiss, comradeship, by, oath, an, expression, which, was, translated, into, the, latin, confoederatio, helvetica, helvetic, confederation, it, had, been, a, confederacy, since, its, inception, in, 1291, as, the, old, swiss, confederacy, which, was, originally, created, as, an, alliance, among, the, valley, communities, of, the, central, alps, until, it, became, a, federation, in, 1848, but, it, retains, the, name, of, confederacy, for, reasons, of, historical, tradition, the, confederacy, facilitated, management, of, common, interests, such, as, freedom, from, external, domination, especially, from, the, habsburg, empire, the, development, of, republican, institutions, in, a, europe, dominated, by, monarchies, and, free, trade, and, it, ensured, peace, between, the, different, cultural, entities, of, the, area, after, the, sonderbund, war, of, 1847, when, some, of, the, catholic, cantons, of, switzerland, attempted, to, set, up, a, separate, union, sonderbund, in, german, against, the, protestant, majority, a, vote, was, held, and, the, majority, of, the, cantons, approved, the, new, federal, constitution, which, changed, the, political, system, to, one, of, a, federation, in, 1999, russia, and, belarus, signed, a, treaty, to, form, a, confederation, which, came, into, force, on, 26, january, 2000, although, it, was, given, the, name, union, state, and, has, some, characteristics, of, a, federation, it, remains, a, confederation, of, two, sovereign, states, its, existence, has, been, seen, as, an, indication, of, russia, s, political, and, economic, support, for, the, belarusian, government, the, confederation, was, created, with, the, objective, of, co, ordinating, common, action, on, economic, integration, and, foreign, affairs, however, many, of, the, treaty, s, provisions, have, not, yet, been, implemented, consequently, the, times, in, 2020, described, it, as, a, mostly, unimplemented, confederation, on, july, 6, 2024, at, the, end, of, the, first, summit, of, the, alliance, of, sahel, states, aes, the, final, communiqu, announced, the, creation, of, a, confederation, of, the, three, countries, of, the, aes, namely, mali, burkina, faso, and, niger, it, was, in, february, 2024, that, the, military, powers, of, the, three, countries, announced, the, creation, of, the, aes, after, their, withdrawal, from, ecowas, historical, confederations, especially, those, predating, the, 20th, century, may, not, fit, the, current, definition, of, a, confederation, may, be, proclaimed, as, a, federation, but, be, confederal, or, the, reverse, and, may, not, show, any, qualities, that, 21st, century, political, scientists, might, classify, as, those, of, a, confederation, some, have, more, the, characteristics, of, a, personal, union, but, appear, here, because, of, their, self, styling, as, a, confederation
