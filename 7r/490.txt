in, law, an, appeal, is, the, process, in, which, cases, are, reviewed, by, a, higher, authority, where, parties, request, a, formal, change, to, an, official, decision, appeals, function, both, as, a, process, for, error, correction, as, well, as, a, process, of, clarifying, and, interpreting, law, although, appellate, courts, have, existed, for, thousands, of, years, common, law, countries, did, not, incorporate, an, affirmative, right, to, appeal, into, their, jurisprudence, until, the, 19th, century, american, english, and, british, english, have, diverged, significantly, on, the, topic, of, appellate, terminology, american, cases, go, up, on, appeal, and, one, appeals, from, intransitive, or, appeals, transitive, an, order, award, judgment, or, conviction, while, decisions, of, british, courts, are, said, to, be, under, appeal, and, one, appeals, against, a, judgment, an, american, court, disposes, of, an, appeal, with, words, like, judgment, affirmed, the, appeal, is, without, merit, or, judgment, reversed, the, appeal, has, merit, while, a, british, court, disposes, of, an, appeal, with, words, like, appeal, dismissed, the, appeal, is, without, merit, or, appeal, allowed, the, appeal, has, merit, appellate, courts, and, other, systems, of, error, correction, have, existed, for, many, millennia, during, the, first, dynasty, of, babylon, hammurabi, and, his, governors, served, as, the, highest, appellate, courts, of, the, land, ancient, roman, law, recognized, the, right, to, appeal, in, the, valerian, and, porcian, laws, since, 509, bc, later, it, employed, a, complex, hierarchy, of, appellate, courts, where, some, appeals, would, be, heard, by, the, emperor, additionally, appellate, courts, have, existed, in, japan, since, at, least, the, kamakura, shogunate, 1185, 1333, during, this, time, the, shogunate, established, hikitsuke, a, high, appellate, court, to, aid, the, state, in, adjudicating, lawsuits, although, some, scholars, argue, that, the, right, to, appeal, is, itself, a, substantive, liberty, interest, the, notion, of, a, right, to, appeal, is, a, relatively, recent, advent, in, common, law, jurisdictions, commentators, have, observed, that, common, law, jurisdictions, were, particularly, slow, to, incorporate, a, right, to, appeal, into, either, its, civil, or, criminal, jurisprudence, the, idea, of, an, appeal, from, court, to, court, as, distinguished, from, court, directly, to, the, crown, was, unheard, of, in, early, english, courts, english, common, law, courts, eventually, developed, the, writs, of, error, and, certiorari, as, routes, to, appellate, relief, but, both, types, of, writs, were, severely, limited, in, comparison, to, modern, appeals, in, terms, of, availability, scope, of, review, and, remedies, afforded, for, example, writs, of, error, were, originally, not, available, as, a, matter, of, right, and, were, issued, only, upon, the, recommendation, of, the, attorney, general, which, was, initially, discretionary, but, by, modern, times, was, regularly, granted, certiorari, was, originally, available, only, for, summary, offences, in, the, early, 19th, century, certiorari, became, available, for, indictable, offences, but, only, to, obtain, relief, before, judgment, due, to, widespread, dissatisfaction, with, writs, resulting, in, the, introduction, of, at, least, 28, separate, bills, in, parliament, england, switched, over, to, appeals, in, civil, cases, in, 1873, and, in, criminal, cases, in, 1907, the, united, states, first, created, a, system, of, federal, appellate, courts, in, 1789, but, a, federal, right, to, appeal, did, not, exist, in, the, united, states, until, 1889, when, congress, passed, the, judiciary, act, to, permit, appeals, in, capital, cases, two, years, later, the, right, to, appeals, was, extended, to, other, criminal, cases, and, the, united, states, courts, of, appeals, were, established, to, review, decisions, from, district, courts, some, states, such, as, minnesota, still, do, not, formally, recognize, a, right, to, criminal, appeals, the, u, s, supreme, court, has, repeatedly, ruled, that, there, is, no, federal, constitutional, right, to, an, appeal, we, are, not, final, because, we, are, infallible, but, we, are, infallible, only, because, we, are, final, associate, supreme, court, justice, robert, h, jackson, discussing, the, supreme, court, of, the, united, states, role, as, a, court, of, last, resort, although, some, courts, permit, appeals, at, preliminary, stages, of, litigation, most, litigants, appeal, final, orders, and, judgments, from, lower, courts, a, fundamental, premise, of, many, legal, systems, is, that, appellate, courts, review, questions, of, law, de, novo, but, appellate, courts, do, not, conduct, independent, fact, finding, instead, appellate, courts, will, generally, defer, to, the, record, established, by, the, trial, court, unless, some, error, occurred, during, the, fact, finding, process, many, jurisdictions, provide, a, statutory, or, constitutional, right, for, litigants, to, appeal, adverse, decisions, however, most, jurisdictions, also, recognize, that, this, right, may, be, waived, in, the, united, states, for, example, litigants, may, waive, the, right, to, appeal, as, long, as, the, waiver, is, considered, and, intelligent, the, appellate, process, usually, begins, when, an, appellate, court, grants, a, party, s, petition, for, review, or, petition, for, certiorari, unlike, trials, which, many, common, law, jurisdictions, typically, perform, with, a, jury, appeals, are, generally, presented, to, a, judge, or, a, panel, of, judges, before, hearing, oral, argument, parties, will, generally, submit, legal, briefs, in, which, the, parties, present, their, arguments, at, length, in, writing, appellate, courts, may, also, grant, permission, for, an, amicus, curiae, to, submit, a, brief, in, support, of, a, particular, party, or, position, after, submitting, briefs, parties, often, have, the, opportunity, to, present, an, oral, argument, to, a, judge, or, panel, of, judges, during, oral, arguments, judges, often, ask, questions, to, attorneys, to, challenge, their, arguments, or, to, advance, their, own, legal, theories, after, deliberating, in, chambers, appellate, courts, issue, formal, written, opinions, that, resolve, the, legal, issues, presented, for, review, the, appeal, may, end, with, a, reversal, in, which, the, lower, court, s, decision, is, found, to, be, incorrect, resulting, in, the, original, judgement, being, vacated, and, the, lower, court, instructed, to, retry, the, case, or, an, affirmation, in, which, the, lower, court, s, decision, is, found, to, be, correct, when, considering, cases, on, appeal, appellate, courts, generally, affirm, reverse, or, vacate, the, decision, of, a, lower, court, some, courts, maintain, a, dual, function, where, they, consider, both, appeals, and, matters, of, first, instance, for, example, the, supreme, court, of, the, united, states, primarily, hears, cases, on, appeal, but, retains, original, jurisdiction, over, a, limited, range, of, cases, some, jurisdictions, maintain, a, system, of, intermediate, appellate, courts, which, are, subject, to, the, review, of, higher, appellate, courts, the, highest, appellate, court, in, a, jurisdiction, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, a, court, of, last, resort, or, supreme, court
