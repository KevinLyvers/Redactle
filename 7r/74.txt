the, automotive, industry, comprises, a, wide, range, of, companies, and, organizations, involved, in, the, design, development, manufacturing, marketing, selling, repairing, and, modification, of, motor, vehicles, it, is, one, of, the, world, s, largest, industries, by, revenue, from, 16, such, as, in, france, up, to, 40, to, countries, like, slovakia, the, word, automotive, comes, from, the, greek, autos, self, and, latin, motivus, of, motion, referring, to, any, form, of, self, powered, vehicle, this, term, as, proposed, by, elmer, sperry, 1860, 1930, first, came, into, use, to, describe, automobiles, in, 1898, the, automotive, industry, began, in, the, 1860s, with, hundreds, of, manufacturers, pioneering, the, horseless, carriage, early, car, manufacturing, involved, manual, assembly, by, a, human, worker, the, process, evolved, from, engineers, working, on, a, stationary, car, to, a, conveyor, belt, system, where, the, car, passed, through, multiple, stations, of, more, specialized, engineers, starting, in, the, 1960s, robotic, equipment, was, introduced, to, the, process, and, most, cars, are, now, mainly, assembled, by, automated, machinery, for, many, decades, the, united, states, led, the, world, in, total, automobile, production, with, the, u, s, big, three, general, motors, ford, motor, company, and, chrysler, being, the, world, s, three, largest, auto, manufacturers, for, a, time, and, g, m, and, ford, remaining, the, two, largest, until, the, mid, 2000s, in, 1929, before, the, great, depression, the, world, had, 32, 028, 500, automobiles, in, use, of, which, the, u, s, automobile, enterprises, produced, more, than, 90, at, that, time, the, u, s, had, one, car, per, 4, 87, persons, after, 1945, the, u, s, produced, around, three, quarters, of, the, world, s, auto, production, in, 1980, the, u, s, was, overtaken, by, japan, and, then, became, a, world, leader, again, in, 1994, japan, narrowly, passed, the, u, s, in, production, during, 2006, and, 2007, and, in, 2008, also, china, which, in, 2009, took, the, top, spot, from, japan, with, 13, 8, million, units, although, the, u, s, surpassed, japan, in, 2011, to, become, the, second, largest, automobile, industry, in, 2023, china, had, for, the, first, time, in, history, more, than, 30, million, produced, vehicles, a, year, after, reaching, 29, million, for, the, first, time, in, 2017, and, 28, million, the, year, before, from, 1970, 140, models, over, 1998, 260, models, to, 2012, 684, models, the, number, of, automobile, models, in, the, u, s, has, grown, exponentially, safety, is, a, state, that, implies, being, protected, from, any, risk, danger, damage, or, cause, of, injury, in, the, automotive, industry, safety, means, that, users, operators, or, manufacturers, do, not, face, any, risk, or, danger, coming, from, the, motor, vehicle, or, its, spare, parts, safety, for, the, automobiles, themselves, implies, that, there, is, no, risk, of, damage, safety, in, the, automotive, industry, is, particularly, important, and, therefore, highly, regulated, automobiles, and, other, motor, vehicles, have, to, comply, with, a, certain, number, of, regulations, whether, local, or, international, in, order, to, be, accepted, on, the, market, the, standard, iso, 26262, is, considered, one, of, the, best, practice, frameworks, for, achieving, automotive, functional, safety, in, case, of, safety, issues, danger, product, defect, or, faulty, procedure, during, the, manufacturing, of, the, motor, vehicle, the, maker, can, request, to, return, either, a, batch, or, the, entire, production, run, this, procedure, is, called, product, recall, product, recalls, happen, in, every, industry, and, can, be, production, related, or, stem, from, raw, materials, product, and, operation, tests, and, inspections, at, different, stages, of, the, value, chain, are, made, to, avoid, these, product, recalls, by, ensuring, end, user, security, and, safety, and, compliance, with, the, automotive, industry, requirements, however, the, automotive, industry, is, still, particularly, concerned, about, product, recalls, which, cause, considerable, financial, consequences, in, 2007, there, were, about, 806, million, cars, and, light, trucks, on, the, road, consuming, over, 980, billion, litres, 980, 000, 000, m, 3, of, gasoline, and, diesel, fuel, yearly, the, automobile, is, a, primary, mode, of, transportation, for, many, developed, economies, the, detroit, branch, of, boston, consulting, group, predicted, that, by, 2014, one, third, of, world, demand, would, be, in, the, four, bric, markets, brazil, russia, india, and, china, meanwhile, in, developed, countries, the, automotive, industry, has, slowed, it, is, also, expected, that, this, trend, will, continue, especially, as, the, younger, generations, of, people, in, highly, urbanized, countries, no, longer, want, to, own, a, car, and, prefer, other, modes, of, transport, other, potentially, powerful, automotive, markets, are, iran, and, indonesia, emerging, automobile, markets, already, buy, more, cars, than, established, markets, according, to, a, j, d, power, study, emerging, markets, accounted, for, 51, percent, of, the, global, light, vehicle, sales, in, 2010, the, study, performed, in, 2010, expected, this, trend, to, accelerate, however, more, recent, reports, 2012, confirmed, the, opposite, namely, that, the, automotive, industry, was, slowing, down, even, in, bric, countries, in, the, united, states, vehicle, sales, peaked, in, 2000, at, 17, 8, million, units, in, july, 2021, the, european, commission, released, its, fit, for, 55, legislation, package, which, contains, important, guidelines, for, the, future, of, the, automotive, industry, all, new, cars, on, the, european, market, must, be, zero, emission, vehicles, from, 2035, the, governments, of, 24, developed, countries, and, a, group, of, major, car, manufacturers, including, gm, ford, volvo, byd, auto, jaguar, land, rover, and, mercedes, benz, committed, to, work, towards, all, sales, of, new, cars, and, vans, being, zero, emission, globally, by, 2040, and, by, no, later, than, 2035, in, leading, markets, major, car, manufacturing, nations, like, the, united, states, germany, china, japan, and, south, korea, as, well, as, volkswagen, toyota, peugeot, honda, nissan, and, hyundai, did, not, pledge, the, global, automotive, industry, is, a, major, consumer, of, water, some, estimates, surpass, 180, 000, l, 39, 000, imp, gal, of, water, per, car, manufactured, depending, on, whether, tyre, production, is, included, production, processes, that, use, a, significant, volume, of, water, include, surface, treatment, painting, coating, washing, cooling, air, conditioning, and, boilers, not, counting, component, manufacturing, paintshop, operations, consume, especially, large, amounts, of, water, because, equipment, running, on, water, based, products, must, also, be, cleaned, with, water, in, 2022, tesla, s, gigafactory, berlin, brandenburg, ran, into, legal, challenges, due, to, droughts, and, falling, groundwater, levels, in, the, region, brandenburg, s, economy, minister, joerg, steinbach, said, that, while, water, supply, was, sufficient, during, the, first, stage, more, would, be, needed, once, tesla, expands, the, site, the, factory, would, nearly, double, the, water, consumption, in, the, gruenheide, area, with, 1, 4, million, cubic, meters, being, contracted, from, local, authorities, per, year, enough, for, a, city, of, around, 40, 000, people, steinbach, said, that, the, authorities, would, like, to, drill, for, more, water, there, and, outsource, any, additional, supply, if, necessary, 1960s, post, war,
