cuneiform, is, a, logo, syllabic, writing, system, that, was, used, to, write, several, languages, of, the, ancient, near, east, the, script, was, in, active, use, from, the, early, bronze, age, until, the, beginning, of, the, common, era, cuneiform, scripts, are, marked, by, and, named, for, the, characteristic, wedge, shaped, impressions, latin, cuneus, which, form, their, signs, cuneiform, is, the, earliest, known, writing, system, and, was, originally, developed, to, write, the, sumerian, language, of, southern, mesopotamia, modern, iraq, over, the, course, of, its, history, cuneiform, was, adapted, to, write, a, number, of, languages, in, addition, to, sumerian, akkadian, texts, are, attested, from, the, 24th, century, bc, onward, and, make, up, the, bulk, of, the, cuneiform, record, akkadian, cuneiform, was, itself, adapted, to, write, the, hittite, language, in, the, early, second, millennium, bc, the, other, languages, with, significant, cuneiform, corpora, are, eblaite, elamite, hurrian, luwian, and, urartian, the, old, persian, and, ugaritic, alphabets, feature, cuneiform, style, signs, however, they, are, unrelated, to, the, cuneiform, logo, syllabary, proper, the, latest, known, cuneiform, tablet, dates, to, 75, ad, cuneiform, was, rediscovered, in, modern, times, in, the, early, 17th, century, with, the, publication, of, the, trilingual, achaemenid, royal, inscriptions, at, persepolis, these, were, first, deciphered, in, the, early, 19th, century, the, modern, study, of, cuneiform, belongs, to, the, ambiguously, named, field, of, assyriology, as, the, earliest, excavations, of, cuneiform, libraries, in, the, mid, 19th, century, were, in, the, area, of, ancient, assyria, an, estimated, half, a, million, tablets, are, held, in, museums, across, the, world, but, comparatively, few, of, these, are, published, the, largest, collections, belong, to, the, british, museum, approx, 130, 000, tablets, the, vorderasiatisches, museum, berlin, the, louvre, the, istanbul, archaeology, museums, the, national, museum, of, iraq, the, yale, babylonian, collection, approx, 40, 000, tablets, and, penn, museum, writing, began, after, pottery, was, invented, during, the, neolithic, when, clay, tokens, were, used, to, record, specific, amounts, of, livestock, or, commodities, in, recent, years, a, contrarian, view, has, arisen, on, the, tokens, being, the, precursor, of, writing, these, tokens, were, initially, impressed, on, the, surface, of, round, clay, envelopes, clay, bullae, and, then, stored, in, them, the, tokens, were, then, progressively, replaced, by, flat, tablets, on, which, signs, were, recorded, with, a, stylus, writing, is, first, recorded, in, uruk, at, the, end, of, the, 4th, millennium, bc, and, soon, after, in, various, parts, of, the, near, east, an, ancient, mesopotamian, poem, gives, the, first, known, story, of, the, invention, of, writing, because, the, messenger, s, mouth, was, heavy, and, he, couldn, t, repeat, the, lord, of, kulaba, patted, some, clay, and, put, words, on, it, like, a, tablet, until, then, there, had, been, no, putting, words, on, clay, the, cuneiform, writing, system, was, in, use, for, more, than, three, millennia, through, several, stages, of, development, from, the, 31st, century, bc, down, to, the, second, century, ad, the, latest, firmly, dateable, tablet, from, uruk, dates, to, 79, 80, ad, ultimately, it, was, completely, replaced, by, alphabetic, writing, in, the, general, sense, in, the, course, of, the, roman, era, and, there, are, no, cuneiform, systems, in, current, use, it, had, to, be, deciphered, as, a, completely, unknown, writing, system, in, 19th, century, assyriology, it, was, successfully, deciphered, by, 1857, the, cuneiform, script, changed, considerably, over, more, than, 2, 000, years, the, image, below, shows, the, development, of, the, sign, sa, head, borger, nr, 184, u, 12295, stages, the, cuneiform, script, was, developed, from, pictographic, proto, writing, in, the, late, 4th, millennium, bc, stemming, from, the, near, eastern, token, system, used, for, accounting, the, meaning, and, usage, of, these, tokens, is, still, a, matter, of, debate, these, tokens, were, in, use, from, the, 9th, millennium, bc, and, remained, in, occasional, use, even, late, in, the, 2nd, millennium, bc, early, tokens, with, pictographic, shapes, of, animals, associated, with, numbers, were, discovered, in, tell, brak, and, date, to, the, mid, 4th, millennium, bc, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, token, shapes, were, the, original, basis, for, some, of, the, sumerian, pictographs, mesopotamia, s, proto, literate, period, spans, roughly, the, 35th, to, 32nd, centuries, bc, the, first, unequivocal, written, documents, start, with, the, uruk, iv, period, from, circa, 3, 300, bc, followed, by, tablets, found, in, uruk, iii, jemdet, nasr, early, dynastic, i, ur, and, susa, in, proto, elamite, dating, to, the, period, until, circa, 2, 900, bc, originally, pictographs, were, either, drawn, on, clay, tablets, in, vertical, columns, with, a, sharpened, reed, stylus, or, incised, in, stone, this, early, style, lacked, the, characteristic, wedge, shape, of, the, strokes, most, proto, cuneiform, records, from, this, period, were, of, an, accounting, nature, the, proto, cuneiform, sign, list, has, grown, as, new, texts, are, discovered, and, shrunk, as, variant, signs, are, combined, the, current, sign, list, is, 705, elements, long, with, 42, being, numeric, and, four, considered, pre, proto, elamite, certain, signs, to, indicate, names, of, gods, countries, cities, vessels, birds, trees, etc, are, known, as, determinatives, and, were, the, sumerian, signs, of, the, terms, in, question, added, as, a, guide, for, the, reader, proper, names, continued, to, be, usually, written, in, purely, logographic, fashion, the, first, inscribed, tablets, were, purely, pictographic, which, makes, it, technically, difficult, to, know, in, which, language, they, were, written, different, languages, have, been, proposed, though, usually, sumerian, is, assumed, later, tablets, dating, after, c, 2900, bc, start, to, use, syllabic, elements, which, clearly, show, a, language, structure, typical, of, the, non, indo, european, agglutinative, sumerian, language, the, first, tablets, using, syllabic, elements, date, to, the, early, dynastic, i, ii, periods, c, 2800, bc, and, they, are, agreed, to, be, clearly, in, sumerian, this, is, the, time, when, some, pictographic, element, started, to, be, used, for, their, phonetic, value, permitting, the, recording, of, abstract, ideas, or, personal, names, many, pictographs, began, to, lose, their, original, function, and, a, given, sign, could, have, various, meanings, depending, on, context, the, sign, inventory, was, reduced, from, some, 1, 500, signs, to, some, 600, signs, and, writing, became, increasingly, phonological, determinative, signs, were, re, introduced, to, avoid, ambiguity, cuneiform, writing, proper, thus, arises, from, the, more, primitive, system, of, pictographs, at, about, that, time, labeled, the, early, bronze, age, ii, epoch, by, historians, the, earliest, known, sumerian, king, whose, name, appears, on, contemporary, cuneiform, tablets, is, enmebaragesi, of, kish, fl, c, 2600, bc, surviving, records, became, less, fragmentary, for, following, reigns, and, by, the, arrival, of, sargon, it, had, become, standard, practice, for, each, major, city, state, to, date, documents, by, year, names, commemorating, the, exploits, of, its, king, geoffrey, sampson, stated, that, egyptian, hieroglyphs, came, into, existence, a, little, after, sumerian, script, and, probably, invented, under, the, influence, of, the, latter, and, that, it, is, probable, that, the, general, idea, of, expressing, words, of, a, language, in, writing, was, brought, to, egypt, from, sumerian, mesopotamia, there, are, many, instances, of, egypt, mesopotamia, relations, at, the, time, of, the, invention, of, writing, and, standard, reconstructions, of, the, development, of, writing, generally, place, the, development, of, the, sumerian, proto, cuneiform, script, before, the, development, of, egyptian, hieroglyphs, with, the, suggestion, the, former, influenced, the, latter, but, given, the, lack, of, direct, evidence, for, the, transfer, of, writing, no, definitive, determination, has, been, made, as, to, the, origin, of, hieroglyphics, in, ancient, egypt, others, have, held, that, the, evidence, for, such, direct, influence, remains, flimsy, and, that, a, very, credible, argument, can, also, be, made, for, the, independent, development, of, writing, in, egypt, early, cuneiform, inscriptions, were, made, by, using, a, pointed, stylus, sometimes, called, linear, cuneiform, many, of, the, early, dynastic, inscriptions, particularly, those, made, on, stone, continued, to, use, the, linear, style, as, late, as, circa, 2000, bc, in, the, mid, 3rd, millennium, bc, a, new, wedge, tipped, stylus, was, introduced, which, was, pushed, into, the, clay, producing, wedge, shaped, cuneiform, this, development, made, writing, quicker, and, easier, especially, when, writing, on, soft, clay, by, adjusting, the, relative, position, of, the, stylus, to, the, tablet, the, writer, could, use, a, single, tool, to, make, a, variety, of, impressions, for, numbers, a, round, tipped, stylus, was, initially, used, until, the, wedge, tipped, stylus, was, generalized, the, direction, of, writing, was, from, top, to, bottom, and, right, to, left, cuneiform, clay, tablets, could, be, fired, in, kilns, to, bake, them, hard, and, so, provide, a, permanent, record, or, they, could, be, left, moist, and, recycled, if, permanence, was, not, needed, most, surviving, cuneiform, tablets, were, of, the, latter, kind, accidentally, preserved, when, fires, destroyed, the, tablets, storage, place, and, effectively, baked, them, unintentionally, ensuring, their, longevity, the, script, was, widely, used, on, commemorative, stelae, and, carved, reliefs, to, record, the, achievements, of, the, ruler, in, whose, honor, the, monument, had, been, erected, the, spoken, language, included, many, homophones, and, near, homophones, and, in, the, beginning, similar, sounding, words, such, as, life, and, arrow, were, written, with, the, same, symbol, as, a, result, many, signs, gradually, changed, from, being, logograms, to, also, functioning, as, syllabograms, so, that, for, example, the, sign, for, the, word, arrow, would, become, the, sign, for, the, sound, ti, syllabograms, were, used, in, sumerian, writing, especially, to, express, grammatical, elements, and, their, use, was, further, developed, and, modified, in, the, writing, of, the, akkadian, language, to, express, its, sounds, often, words, that, had, a, similar, meaning, but, very, different, sounds, were, written, with, the, same, symbol, for, instance, the, sumerian, words, tooth, mouth, and, voice, were, all, written, with, the, original, pictogram, for, mouth, words, that, sounded, alike, would, have, different, signs, for, instance, the, syllable, had, fourteen, different, symbols, the, inventory, of, signs, was, expanded, by, the, combination, of, existing, signs, into, compound, signs, they, could, either, derive, their, meaning, from, a, combination, of, the, meanings, of, both, original, signs, e, g, ka, mouth, and, a, water, were, combined, to, form, the, sign, for, nag, drink, formally, ka, a, cf, chinese, compound, ideographs, or, one, sign, could, suggest, the, meaning, and, the, other, the, pronunciation, e, g, ka, mouth, was, combined, with, the, sign, nun, prince, to, express, the, word, nundum, meaning, lip, formally, ka, nun, cf, chinese, phono, semantic, compounds, another, way, of, expressing, words, that, had, no, sign, of, their, own, was, by, so, called, diri, compounds, sign, sequences, that, have, in, combination, a, reading, different, from, the, sum, of, the, individual, constituent, signs, for, example, the, compound, igi, a, eye, water, has, the, reading, imhur, meaning, foam, several, symbols, had, too, many, meanings, to, permit, clarity, therefore, symbols, were, put, together, to, indicate, both, the, sound, and, the, meaning, of, a, symbol, for, instance, the, word, raven, uga, had, the, same, logogram, as, the, word, soap, naga, the, name, of, a, city, ere, and, the, patron, goddess, of, eresh, nisaba, to, disambiguate, and, identify, the, word, more, precisely, two, phonetic, complements, were, added, for, the, syllable, in, front, of, the, symbol, and, ga, for, the, syllable, behind, finally, the, symbol, for, bird, mu, en, was, added, to, ensure, proper, interpretation, as, a, result, the, whole, word, could, be, spelt, i, e, naga, ga, mu, en, among, the, many, variant, spellings, that, the, word, could, have, for, unknown, reasons, cuneiform, pictographs, until, then, written, vertically, were, rotated, 90, counterclockwise, in, effect, putting, them, on, their, side, this, change, first, occurred, slightly, before, the, akkadian, period, at, the, time, of, the, uruk, ruler, lugalzagesi, r, c, 2294, 2270, bc, the, vertical, style, remained, for, monumental, purposes, on, stone, stelas, until, the, middle, of, the, 2nd, millennium, written, sumerian, was, used, as, a, scribal, language, until, the, first, century, ad, the, spoken, language, died, out, between, about, 2100, and, 1700, bc, the, archaic, cuneiform, script, was, adopted, by, the, akkadian, empire, from, the, 23rd, century, bc, short, chronology, the, akkadian, language, being, east, semitic, its, structure, was, completely, different, from, sumerian, the, akkadians, found, a, practical, solution, in, writing, their, language, phonetically, using, the, corresponding, sumerian, phonetic, signs, still, many, of, the, sumerian, characters, were, retained, for, their, logographic, value, as, well, for, example, the, character, for, sheep, was, retained, but, was, now, pronounced, immerum, rather, than, the, sumerian, udu, such, retained, individual, signs, or, sometimes, entire, sign, combinations, with, logographic, value, are, known, as, sumerograms, a, type, of, heterogram, the, east, semitic, languages, employed, equivalents, for, many, signs, that, were, distorted, or, abbreviated, to, represent, new, values, because, the, syllabic, nature, of, the, script, as, refined, by, the, sumerians, was, not, intuitive, to, semitic, speakers, from, the, beginning, of, the, middle, bronze, age, 20th, century, bc, the, script, evolved, to, accommodate, the, various, dialects, of, akkadian, old, akkadian, babylonian, and, assyrian, at, this, stage, the, former, pictograms, were, reduced, to, a, high, level, of, abstraction, and, were, composed, of, only, five, basic, wedge, shapes, horizontal, vertical, two, diagonals, and, the, winkelhaken, impressed, vertically, by, the, tip, of, the, stylus, the, signs, exemplary, of, these, basic, wedges, are, except, for, the, winkelhaken, which, has, no, tail, the, length, of, the, wedges, tails, could, vary, as, required, for, sign, composition, signs, tilted, by, about, 45, degrees, are, called, ten, in, akkadian, thus, di, is, a, vertical, wedge, and, di, ten, a, diagonal, one, if, a, sign, is, modified, with, additional, wedges, this, is, called, gun, or, gunification, if, signs, are, cross, hatched, with, additional, winkelhaken, they, are, called, e, ig, if, signs, are, modified, by, the, removal, of, a, wedge, or, wedges, they, are, called, nutillu, typical, signs, have, about, five, to, ten, wedges, while, complex, ligatures, can, consist, of, twenty, or, more, although, it, is, not, always, clear, if, a, ligature, should, be, considered, a, single, sign, or, two, collated, but, distinct, signs, the, ligature, kaxgur, 7, consists, of, 31, strokes, most, later, adaptations, of, sumerian, cuneiform, preserved, at, least, some, aspects, of, the, sumerian, script, written, akkadian, included, phonetic, symbols, from, the, sumerian, syllabary, together, with, logograms, that, were, read, as, whole, words, many, signs, in, the, script, were, polyvalent, having, both, a, syllabic, and, logographic, meaning, the, complexity, of, the, system, bears, a, resemblance, to, old, japanese, written, in, a, chinese, derived, script, where, some, of, these, sinograms, were, used, as, logograms, and, others, as, phonetic, characters, this, mixed, method, of, writing, continued, through, the, end, of, the, babylonian, and, assyrian, empires, although, there, were, periods, when, purism, was, in, fashion, and, there, was, a, more, marked, tendency, to, spell, out, the, words, laboriously, in, preference, to, using, signs, with, a, phonetic, complement, yet, even, in, those, days, the, babylonian, syllabary, remained, a, mixture, of, logographic, and, phonemic, writing, elamite, cuneiform, was, a, simplified, form, of, the, sumero, akkadian, cuneiform, used, to, write, the, elamite, language, in, the, area, that, corresponds, to, modern, iran, from, the, 3rd, millennium, bc, to, the, 4th, century, bc, elamite, cuneiform, at, times, competed, with, other, local, scripts, proto, elamite, and, linear, elamite, the, earliest, known, elamite, cuneiform, text, is, a, treaty, between, akkadians, and, the, elamites, that, dates, back, to, 2200, bc, some, believe, it, might, have, been, in, use, since, 2500, bc, the, tablets, are, poorly, preserved, so, only, limited, parts, can, be, read, but, it, is, understood, that, the, text, is, a, treaty, between, the, akkad, king, n, rams, n, and, elamite, ruler, hita, as, indicated, by, frequent, references, like, n, rams, n, s, friend, is, my, friend, n, rams, n, s, enemy, is, my, enemy, the, most, famous, elamite, scriptures, and, the, ones, that, ultimately, led, to, its, decipherment, are, the, ones, found, in, the, trilingual, behistun, inscriptions, commissioned, by, the, achaemenid, kings, the, inscriptions, similar, to, that, of, the, rosetta, stone, s, were, written, in, three, different, writing, systems, the, first, was, old, persian, which, was, deciphered, in, 1802, by, georg, friedrich, grotefend, the, second, babylonian, cuneiform, was, deciphered, shortly, after, the, old, persian, text, because, elamite, is, unlike, its, neighboring, semitic, languages, the, script, s, decipherment, was, delayed, until, the, 1840s, elamite, cuneiform, appears, to, have, used, far, fewer, signs, than, its, akkadian, prototype, and, initially, relied, primarily, on, syllabograms, but, logograms, became, more, common, in, later, texts, many, signs, soon, acquired, highly, distinctive, local, shape, variants, that, are, often, difficult, to, recognise, as, related, to, their, akkadian, prototypes, hittite, cuneiform, is, an, adaptation, of, the, old, assyrian, cuneiform, of, c, 1800, bc, to, the, hittite, language, and, was, used, from, the, 17th, until, approximately, the, 13th, century, bc, more, or, less, the, same, system, was, used, by, the, scribes, of, the, hittite, empire, for, two, other, anatolian, languages, namely, luwian, alongside, the, native, anatolian, hieroglyphics, and, palaic, as, well, as, for, the, isolate, hattic, language, when, the, cuneiform, script, was, adapted, to, writing, hittite, a, layer, of, akkadian, logographic, spellings, also, known, as, akkadograms, was, added, to, the, script, in, addition, to, the, sumerian, logograms, or, sumerograms, which, were, already, inherent, in, the, akkadian, writing, system, and, which, hittite, also, kept, thus, the, pronunciations, of, many, hittite, words, which, were, conventionally, written, by, logograms, are, now, unknown, the, hurrian, language, attested, 2300, 1000, bc, and, urartian, language, attested, 9th, 6th, century, bc, were, also, written, in, adapted, versions, of, sumero, akkadian, cuneiform, although, the, two, languages, are, related, their, writing, systems, seem, to, have, been, developed, separately, for, hurrian, there, were, even, different, systems, in, different, polities, in, mitanni, in, mari, in, the, hittite, empire, the, hurrian, orthographies, were, generally, characterised, by, more, extensive, use, of, syllabograms, and, more, limited, use, of, logograms, than, akkadian, urartian, in, comparison, retained, a, more, significant, role, for, logograms, in, the, iron, age, c, 10th, to, 6th, centuries, bc, assyrian, cuneiform, was, further, simplified, the, characters, remained, the, same, as, those, of, sumero, akkadian, cuneiforms, but, the, graphic, design, of, each, character, relied, more, heavily, on, wedges, and, square, angles, making, them, significantly, more, abstract, babylonian, cuneiform, was, simplified, along, similar, lines, during, that, period, albeit, to, a, lesser, extent, and, in, a, slightly, different, way, from, the, 6th, century, the, akkadian, language, was, marginalized, by, aramaic, written, in, the, aramaic, alphabet, but, akkadian, cuneiform, remained, in, use, in, the, literary, tradition, well, into, the, times, of, the, parthian, empire, 250, bc, 226, ad, the, last, known, cuneiform, inscription, an, astronomical, text, was, written, in, 75, ad, the, ability, to, read, cuneiform, may, have, persisted, until, the, third, century, ad, the, complexity, of, cuneiforms, prompted, the, development, of, a, number, of, simplified, versions, of, the, script, old, persian, cuneiform, was, developed, with, an, independent, and, unrelated, set, of, simple, cuneiform, characters, by, darius, the, great, in, the, 5th, century, bc, most, scholars, consider, this, writing, system, to, be, an, independent, invention, because, it, has, no, obvious, connections, with, other, writing, systems, at, the, time, such, as, elamite, akkadian, hurrian, and, hittite, cuneiforms, it, formed, a, semi, alphabetic, syllabary, using, far, fewer, wedge, strokes, than, assyrian, used, together, with, a, handful, of, logograms, for, frequently, occurring, words, like, god, king, or, country, this, almost, purely, alphabetical, form, of, the, cuneiform, script, 36, phonetic, characters, and, 8, logograms, was, specially, designed, and, used, by, the, early, achaemenid, rulers, from, the, 6th, century, bc, down, to, the, 4th, century, bc, because, of, its, simplicity, and, logical, structure, the, old, persian, cuneiform, script, was, the, first, to, be, deciphered, by, modern, scholars, starting, with, the, accomplishments, of, georg, friedrich, grotefend, in, 1802, various, ancient, bilingual, or, trilingual, inscriptions, then, permitted, to, decipher, the, other, much, more, complicated, and, more, ancient, scripts, as, far, back, as, to, the, 3rd, millennium, sumerian, script, ugaritic, was, written, using, the, ugaritic, alphabet, a, standard, semitic, style, alphabet, an, abjad, written, using, the, cuneiform, method, between, half, a, million, and, two, million, cuneiform, tablets, are, estimated, to, have, been, excavated, in, modern, times, of, which, only, approximately, 30, 000, 100, 000, have, been, read, or, published, the, british, museum, holds, the, largest, collection, approx, 130, 000, tablets, followed, by, the, vorderasiatisches, museum, berlin, the, louvre, the, istanbul, archaeology, museums, the, national, museum, of, iraq, the, yale, babylonian, collection, approx, 40, 000, and, penn, museum, most, of, these, have, lain, in, these, collections, for, a, century, without, being, translated, studied, or, published, as, there, are, only, a, few, hundred, qualified, cuneiformists, in, the, world, the, decipherment, of, cuneiform, began, with, the, decipherment, of, old, persian, cuneiform, in, 1836, the, first, cuneiform, inscriptions, published, in, modern, times, were, copied, from, the, achaemenid, royal, inscriptions, in, the, ruins, of, persepolis, with, the, first, complete, and, accurate, copy, being, published, in, 1778, by, carsten, niebuhr, niebuhr, s, publication, was, used, by, grotefend, in, 1802, to, make, the, first, breakthrough, the, realization, that, niebuhr, had, published, three, different, languages, side, by, side, and, the, recognition, of, the, word, king, the, rediscovery, and, publication, of, cuneiform, took, place, in, the, early, 17th, century, and, early, conclusions, were, drawn, such, as, the, writing, direction, and, that, the, achaemenid, royal, inscriptions, are, three, different, languages, with, two, different, scripts, in, 1620, garc, a, de, silva, figueroa, dated, the, inscriptions, of, persepolis, to, the, achaemenid, period, identified, them, as, old, persian, and, concluded, that, the, ruins, were, the, ancient, residence, of, persepolis, in, 1621, pietro, della, valle, specified, the, direction, of, writing, from, left, to, right, in, 1762, jean, jacques, barth, lemy, found, that, an, inscription, in, persepolis, resembled, that, found, on, a, brick, in, babylon, carsten, niebuhr, made, the, first, copies, of, the, inscriptions, of, persepolis, in, 1778, and, settled, on, three, different, types, of, writing, which, subsequently, became, known, as, niebuhr, i, ii, and, iii, he, was, the, first, to, discover, the, sign, for, a, word, division, in, one, of, the, scriptures, oluf, gerhard, tychsen, was, the, first, to, list, 24, phonetic, or, alphabetic, values, for, the, characters, in, 1798, actual, decipherment, did, not, take, place, until, the, beginning, of, the, 19th, century, initiated, by, georg, friedrich, grotefend, in, his, study, of, old, persian, cuneiform, he, was, followed, by, antoine, jean, saint, martin, in, 1822, and, rasmus, christian, rask, in, 1823, who, was, the, first, to, decipher, the, name, achaemenides, and, the, consonants, m, and, n, eug, ne, burnouf, identified, the, names, of, various, satrapies, and, the, consonants, k, and, z, in, 1833, 1835, christian, lassen, contributed, significantly, to, the, grammatical, understanding, of, the, old, persian, language, and, the, use, of, vowels, the, decipherers, used, the, short, trilingual, inscriptions, from, persepolis, and, the, inscriptions, from, ganjn, me, for, their, work, in, a, final, step, the, decipherment, of, the, trilingual, behistun, inscription, was, completed, by, henry, rawlinson, and, edward, hincks, edward, hincks, discovered, that, old, persian, is, partly, a, syllabary, in, 2023, it, was, shown, that, automatic, high, quality, translation, of, cuneiform, languages, like, akkadian, can, be, achieved, using, natural, language, processing, methods, with, convolutional, neural, networks, cuneiform, has, a, specific, format, for, transliteration, because, of, the, script, s, polyvalence, transliteration, requires, certain, choices, of, the, transliterating, scholar, who, must, decide, in, the, case, of, each, sign, which, of, its, several, possible, meanings, is, intended, in, the, original, document, for, example, the, sign, dingir, in, a, hittite, text, may, represent, either, the, hittite, syllable, an, or, may, be, part, of, an, akkadian, phrase, representing, the, syllable, il, it, may, be, a, sumerogram, representing, the, original, sumerian, meaning, god, or, the, determinative, for, a, deity, in, transliteration, a, different, rendition, of, the, same, glyph, is, chosen, depending, on, its, role, in, the, present, context, therefore, a, text, containing, dingir, and, a, in, succession, could, be, construed, to, represent, the, akkadian, words, ana, ila, god, a, the, accusative, case, ending, god, water, or, a, divine, name, a, or, water, someone, transcribing, the, signs, would, make, the, decision, how, the, signs, should, be, read, and, assemble, the, signs, as, ana, ila, ila, god, accusative, case, etc, a, transliteration, of, these, signs, would, separate, the, signs, with, dashes, il, a, an, a, dingir, a, or, d, a, this, is, still, easier, to, read, than, the, original, cuneiform, but, now, the, reader, is, able, to, trace, the, sounds, back, to, the, original, signs, and, determine, if, the, correct, decision, was, made, on, how, to, read, them, a, transliterated, document, thus, presents, the, reading, preferred, by, the, transliterating, scholar, as, well, as, an, opportunity, to, reconstruct, the, original, text, there, are, differing, conventions, for, transliterating, different, languages, written, with, sumero, akkadian, cuneiform, the, following, conventions, see, wide, use, across, the, different, fields, since, the, sumerian, language, has, only, been, widely, known, and, studied, by, scholars, for, approximately, a, century, changes, in, the, accepted, reading, of, sumerian, names, have, occurred, from, time, to, time, thus, the, name, of, a, king, of, ur, read, ur, bau, at, one, time, was, later, read, as, ur, engur, and, is, now, read, as, ur, nammu, or, ur, namma, for, lugal, zage, si, a, king, of, uruk, some, scholars, continued, to, read, ungal, zaggisi, and, so, forth, with, some, names, of, the, older, period, there, was, often, uncertainty, whether, their, bearers, were, sumerians, or, semites, if, the, former, then, their, names, could, be, assumed, to, be, read, as, sumerian, if, they, were, semites, the, signs, for, writing, their, names, were, probably, to, be, read, according, to, their, semitic, equivalents, though, occasionally, semites, might, be, encountered, bearing, genuine, sumerian, names, there, was, doubt, whether, the, signs, composing, a, semite, s, name, represented, a, phonetic, reading, or, a, logographic, compound, thus, e, g, when, inscriptions, of, a, semitic, ruler, of, kish, whose, name, was, written, uru, mu, ush, were, first, deciphered, that, name, was, first, taken, to, be, logographic, because, uru, mu, ush, could, be, read, as, he, founded, a, city, in, sumerian, and, scholars, accordingly, retranslated, it, back, to, the, original, semitic, as, alu, usharshid, it, was, later, recognized, that, the, uru, sign, can, also, be, read, as, r, and, that, the, name, is, that, of, the, akkadian, king, rimush, the, sumerian, cuneiform, script, had, on, the, order, of, 1, 000, distinct, signs, or, about, 1, 500, if, variants, are, included, this, number, was, reduced, to, about, 600, by, the, 24th, century, bc,

system, a, number, such, as, 70, would, be, represented, with, the, digit, for, 60, and, the, digit, for, 10, it, s, important, to, mention, that, the, number, for, 60, is, the, same, as, the, number, for, 1, the, reason, this, number, isn, t, read, as, 11, is, because, of, the, order, of, the, numbers, 60, then, 10, not, 10, then, 60, cuneiform, script, was, used, in, many, ways, in, ancient, mesopotamia, besides, the, well, known, clay, tablets, and, stone, inscriptions, cuneiform, was, also, written, on, wax, boards, one, example, from, the, 8th, century, bc, was, found, at, nimrud, the, wax, contained, toxic, amounts, of, arsenic, it, was, used, to, record, laws, like, the, code, of, hammurabi, it, was, also, used, for, recording, maps, compiling, medical, manuals, and, documenting, religious, stories, and, beliefs, among, other, uses, in, particular, it, is, thought, to, have, been, used, to, prepare, surveying, data, and, draft, inscriptions, for, kassite, stone, kudurru, studies, by, assyriologists, like, claus, wilcke, and, dominique, charpin, suggest, that, cuneiform, literacy, was, not, reserved, solely, for, the, elite, but, was, common, for, average, citizens, according, to, the, oxford, handbook, of, cuneiform, culture, cuneiform, script, was, used, at, a, variety, of, literacy, levels, average, citizens, needed, only, a, basic, functional, knowledge, of, cuneiform, script, to, write, personal, letters, and, business, documents, citizens, with, a, higher, degree, of, literacy, put, the, script, to, more, technical, use, listing, medicines, and, diagnoses, and, writing, mathematical, equations, scholars, held, the, highest, literacy, level, of, cuneiform, and, mostly, focused, on, writing, as, a, complex, skill, and, an, art, form, cuneiform, is, occasionally, used, nowadays, as, inspiration, for, logos, as, of, version, 15, 1, the, following, ranges, are, assigned, to, the, sumero, akkadian, cuneiform, script, in, the, unicode, standard, the, final, proposal, for, unicode, encoding, of, the, script, was, submitted, by, two, cuneiform, scholars, working, with, an, experienced, unicode, proposal, writer, in, june, 2004, the, base, character, inventory, is, derived, from, the, list, of, ur, iii, signs, compiled, by, the, cuneiform, digital, library, initiative, of, ucla, based, on, the, inventories, of, miguel, civil, rykle, borger, 2003, and, robert, englund, rather, than, opting, for, a, direct, ordering, by, glyph, shape, and, complexity, according, to, the, numbering, of, an, existing, catalog, the, unicode, order, of, glyphs, was, based, on, the, latin, alphabetic, order, of, their, last, sumerian, transliteration, as, a, practical, approximation, once, in, unicode, glyphs, can, be, automatically, processed, into, segmented, transliterations, numerous, efforts, have, been, made, since, the, 19th, century, to, create, a, corpus, of, known, cuneiform, inscriptions, in, the, 21st, century, the, cuneiform, digital, library, initiative, and, open, richly, annotated, cuneiform, corpus, are, two, of, the, most, significant, projects
