phonetics, is, a, branch, of, linguistics, that, studies, how, humans, produce, and, perceive, sounds, or, in, the, case, of, sign, languages, the, equivalent, aspects, of, sign, linguists, who, specialize, in, studying, the, physical, properties, of, speech, are, phoneticians, the, field, of, phonetics, is, traditionally, divided, into, three, sub, disciplines, based, on, the, research, questions, involved, such, as, how, humans, plan, and, execute, movements, to, produce, speech, articulatory, phonetics, how, various, movements, affect, the, properties, of, the, resulting, sound, acoustic, phonetics, or, how, humans, convert, sound, waves, to, linguistic, information, auditory, phonetics, traditionally, the, minimal, linguistic, unit, of, phonetics, is, the, phone, a, speech, sound, in, a, language, which, differs, from, the, phonological, unit, of, phoneme, the, phoneme, is, an, abstract, categorization, of, phones, and, it, is, also, defined, as, the, smallest, unit, that, discerns, meaning, between, sounds, in, any, given, language, phonetics, deals, with, two, aspects, of, human, speech, production, the, ways, humans, make, sounds, and, perception, the, way, speech, is, understood, the, communicative, modality, of, a, language, describes, the, method, by, which, a, language, produces, and, perceives, languages, languages, with, oral, aural, modalities, such, as, english, produce, speech, orally, and, perceive, speech, aurally, using, the, ears, sign, languages, such, as, australian, sign, language, auslan, and, american, sign, language, asl, have, a, manual, visual, modality, producing, speech, manually, using, the, hands, and, perceiving, speech, visually, asl, and, some, other, sign, languages, have, in, addition, a, manual, manual, dialect, for, use, in, tactile, signing, by, deafblind, speakers, where, signs, are, produced, with, the, hands, and, perceived, with, the, hands, as, well, language, production, consists, of, several, interdependent, processes, which, transform, a, non, linguistic, message, into, a, spoken, or, signed, linguistic, signal, after, identifying, a, message, to, be, linguistically, encoded, a, speaker, must, select, the, individual, words, known, as, lexical, items, to, represent, that, message, in, a, process, called, lexical, selection, during, phonological, encoding, the, mental, representation, of, the, words, are, assigned, their, phonological, content, as, a, sequence, of, phonemes, to, be, produced, the, phonemes, are, specified, for, articulatory, features, which, denote, particular, goals, such, as, closed, lips, or, the, tongue, in, a, particular, location, these, phonemes, are, then, coordinated, into, a, sequence, of, muscle, commands, that, can, be, sent, to, the, muscles, and, when, these, commands, are, executed, properly, the, intended, sounds, are, produced, these, movements, disrupt, and, modify, an, airstream, which, results, in, a, sound, wave, the, modification, is, done, by, the, articulators, with, different, places, and, manners, of, articulation, producing, different, acoustic, results, for, example, the, words, tack, and, sack, both, begin, with, alveolar, sounds, in, english, but, differ, in, how, far, the, tongue, is, from, the, alveolar, ridge, this, difference, has, large, effects, on, the, air, stream, and, thus, the, sound, that, is, produced, similarly, the, direction, and, source, of, the, airstream, can, affect, the, sound, the, most, common, airstream, mechanism, is, pulmonic, using, the, lungs, but, the, glottis, and, tongue, can, also, be, used, to, produce, airstreams, language, perception, is, the, process, by, which, a, linguistic, signal, is, decoded, and, understood, by, a, listener, to, perceive, speech, the, continuous, acoustic, signal, must, be, converted, into, discrete, linguistic, units, such, as, phonemes, morphemes, and, words, to, correctly, identify, and, categorize, sounds, listeners, prioritize, certain, aspects, of, the, signal, that, can, reliably, distinguish, between, linguistic, categories, while, certain, cues, are, prioritized, over, others, many, aspects, of, the, signal, can, contribute, to, perception, for, example, though, oral, languages, prioritize, acoustic, information, the, mcgurk, effect, shows, that, visual, information, is, used, to, distinguish, ambiguous, information, when, the, acoustic, cues, are, unreliable, modern, phonetics, has, three, branches, the, first, known, study, of, phonetics, phonetic, was, undertaken, by, sanskrit, grammarians, as, early, as, the, 6th, century, bce, the, hindu, scholar, p, ini, is, among, the, most, well, known, of, these, early, investigators, his, four, part, grammar, written, c, 350, bce, is, influential, in, modern, linguistics, and, still, represents, the, most, complete, generative, grammar, of, any, language, yet, written, his, grammar, formed, the, basis, of, modern, linguistics, and, described, several, important, phonetic, principles, including, voicing, this, early, account, described, resonance, as, being, produced, either, by, tone, when, vocal, folds, are, closed, or, noise, when, vocal, folds, are, open, the, phonetic, principles, in, the, grammar, are, considered, primitives, in, that, they, are, the, basis, for, his, theoretical, analysis, rather, than, the, objects, of, theoretical, analysis, themselves, and, the, principles, can, be, inferred, from, his, system, of, phonology, the, sanskrit, study, of, phonetics, is, called, shiksha, which, the, 1st, millennium, bce, taittiriya, upanishad, defines, as, follows, om, we, will, explain, the, shiksha, sounds, and, accentuation, quantity, of, vowels, and, the, expression, of, consonants, balancing, saman, and, connection, of, sounds, so, much, about, the, study, of, shiksha, 1, taittiriya, upanishad, 1, 2, shikshavalli, translated, by, paul, deussen, advancements, in, phonetics, after, p, ini, and, his, contemporaries, were, limited, until, the, modern, era, save, some, limited, investigations, by, greek, and, roman, grammarians, in, the, millennia, between, indic, grammarians, and, modern, phonetics, the, focus, shifted, from, the, difference, between, spoken, and, written, language, which, was, the, driving, force, behind, p, ini, s, account, and, began, to, focus, on, the, physical, properties, of, speech, alone, sustained, interest, in, phonetics, began, again, around, 1800, ce, with, the, term, phonetics, being, first, used, in, the, present, sense, in, 1841, with, new, developments, in, medicine, and, the, development, of, audio, and, visual, recording, devices, phonetic, insights, were, able, to, use, and, review, new, and, more, detailed, data, this, early, period, of, modern, phonetics, included, the, development, of, an, influential, phonetic, alphabet, based, on, articulatory, positions, by, alexander, melville, bell, known, as, visible, speech, it, gained, prominence, as, a, tool, in, the, oral, education, of, deaf, children, before, the, widespread, availability, of, audio, recording, equipment, phoneticians, relied, heavily, on, a, tradition, of, practical, phonetics, to, ensure, that, transcriptions, and, findings, were, able, to, be, consistent, across, phoneticians, this, training, involved, both, ear, training, the, recognition, of, speech, sounds, as, well, as, production, training, the, ability, to, produce, sounds, phoneticians, were, expected, to, learn, to, recognize, by, ear, the, various, sounds, on, the, international, phonetic, alphabet, and, the, ipa, still, tests, and, certifies, speakers, on, their, ability, to, accurately, produce, the, phonetic, patterns, of, english, though, they, have, discontinued, this, practice, for, other, languages, as, a, revision, of, his, visible, speech, method, melville, bell, developed, a, description, of, vowels, by, height, and, backness, resulting, in, 9, cardinal, vowels, as, part, of, their, training, in, practical, phonetics, phoneticians, were, expected, to, learn, to, produce, these, cardinal, vowels, to, anchor, their, perception, and, transcription, of, these, phones, during, fieldwork, this, approach, was, critiqued, by, peter, ladefoged, in, the, 1960s, based, on, experimental, evidence, where, he, found, that, cardinal, vowels, were, auditory, rather, than, articulatory, targets, challenging, the, claim, that, they, represented, articulatory, anchors, by, which, phoneticians, could, judge, other, articulations, language, production, consists, of, several, interdependent, processes, which, transform, a, nonlinguistic, message, into, a, spoken, or, signed, linguistic, signal, linguists, debate, whether, the, process, of, language, production, occurs, in, a, series, of, stages, serial, processing, or, whether, production, processes, occur, in, parallel, after, identifying, a, message, to, be, linguistically, encoded, a, speaker, must, select, the, individual, words, known, as, lexical, items, to, represent, that, message, in, a, process, called, lexical, selection, the, words, are, selected, based, on, their, meaning, which, in, linguistics, is, called, semantic, information, lexical, selection, activates, the, word, s, lemma, which, contains, both, semantic, and, grammatical, information, about, the, word, after, an, utterance, has, been, planned, it, then, goes, through, phonological, encoding, in, this, stage, of, language, production, the, mental, representation, of, the, words, are, assigned, their, phonological, content, as, a, sequence, of, phonemes, to, be, produced, the, phonemes, are, specified, for, articulatory, features, which, denote, particular, goals, such, as, closed, lips, or, the, tongue, in, a, particular, location, these, phonemes, are, then, coordinated, into, a, sequence, of, muscle, commands, that, can, be, sent, to, the, muscles, and, when, these, commands, are, executed, properly, the, intended, sounds, are, produced, thus, the, process, of, production, from, message, to, sound, can, be, summarized, as, the, following, sequence, sounds, which, are, made, by, a, full, or, partial, constriction, of, the, vocal, tract, are, called, consonants, consonants, are, pronounced, in, the, vocal, tract, usually, in, the, mouth, and, the, location, of, this, constriction, affects, the, resulting, sound, because, of, the, close, connection, between, the, position, of, the, tongue, and, the, resulting, sound, the, place, of, articulation, is, an, important, concept, in, many, subdisciplines, of, phonetics, sounds, are, partly, categorized, by, the, location, of, a, constriction, as, well, as, the, part, of, the, body, doing, the, constricting, for, example, in, english, the, words, fought, and, thought, are, a, minimal, pair, differing, only, in, the, organ, making, the, construction, rather, than, the, location, of, the, construction, the, f, in, fought, is, a, labiodental, articulation, made, with, the, bottom, lip, against, the, teeth, the, th, in, thought, is, a, linguodental, articulation, made, with, the, tongue, against, the, teeth, constrictions, made, by, the, lips, are, called, labials, while, those, made, with, the, tongue, are, called, lingual, constrictions, made, with, the, tongue, can, be, made, in, several, parts, of, the, vocal, tract, broadly, classified, into, coronal, dorsal, and, radical, places, of, articulation, coronal, articulations, are, made, with, the, front, of, the, tongue, dorsal, articulations, are, made, with, the, back, of, the, tongue, and, radical, articulations, are, made, in, the, pharynx, these, divisions, are, not, sufficient, for, distinguishing, and, describing, all, speech, sounds, for, example, in, english, the, sounds, and, are, both, coronal, but, they, are, produced, in, different, places, of, the, mouth, to, account, for, this, more, detailed, places, of, articulation, are, needed, based, upon, the, area, of, the, mouth, in, which, the, constriction, occurs, articulations, involving, the, lips, can, be, made, in, three, different, ways, with, both, lips, bilabial, with, one, lip, and, the, teeth, so, they, have, the, lower, lip, as, the, active, articulator, and, the, upper, teeth, as, the, passive, articulator, labiodental, and, with, the, tongue, and, the, upper, lip, linguolabial, depending, on, the, definition, used, some, or, all, of, these, kinds, of, articulations, may, be, categorized, into, the, class, of, labial, articulations, bilabial, consonants, are, made, with, both, lips, in, producing, these, sounds, the, lower, lip, moves, farthest, to, meet, the, upper, lip, which, also, moves, down, slightly, though, in, some, cases, the, force, from, air, moving, through, the, aperture, opening, between, the, lips, may, cause, the, lips, to, separate, faster, than, they, can, come, together, unlike, most, other, articulations, both, articulators, are, made, from, soft, tissue, and, so, bilabial, stops, are, more, likely, to, be, produced, with, incomplete, closures, than, articulations, involving, hard, surfaces, like, the, teeth, or, palate, bilabial, stops, are, also, unusual, in, that, an, articulator, in, the, upper, section, of, the, vocal, tract, actively, moves, downward, as, the, upper, lip, shows, some, active, downward, movement, linguolabial, consonants, are, made, with, the, blade, of, the, tongue, approaching, or, contacting, the, upper, lip, like, in, bilabial, articulations, the, upper, lip, moves, slightly, towards, the, more, active, articulator, articulations, in, this, group, do, not, have, their, own, symbols, in, the, international, phonetic, alphabet, rather, they, are, formed, by, combining, an, apical, symbol, with, a, diacritic, implicitly, placing, them, in, the, coronal, category, they, exist, in, a, number, of, languages, indigenous, to, vanuatu, such, as, tangoa, labiodental, consonants, are, made, by, the, lower, lip, rising, to, the, upper, teeth, labiodental, consonants, are, most, often, fricatives, while, labiodental, nasals, are, also, typologically, common, there, is, debate, as, to, whether, true, labiodental, plosives, occur, in, any, natural, language, though, a, number, of, languages, are, reported, to, have, labiodental, plosives, including, zulu, tonga, and, shubi, coronal, consonants, are, made, with, the, tip, or, blade, of, the, tongue, and, because, of, the, agility, of, the, front, of, the, tongue, represent, a, variety, not, only, in, place, but, in, the, posture, of, the, tongue, the, coronal, places, of, articulation, represent, the, areas, of, the, mouth, where, the, tongue, contacts, or, makes, a, constriction, and, include, dental, alveolar, and, post, alveolar, locations, tongue, postures, using, the, tip, of, the, tongue, can, be, apical, if, using, the, top, of, the, tongue, tip, laminal, if, made, with, the, blade, of, the, tongue, or, sub, apical, if, the, tongue, tip, is, curled, back, and, the, bottom, of, the, tongue, is, used, coronals, are, unique, as, a, group, in, that, every, manner, of, articulation, is, attested, australian, languages, are, well, known, for, the, large, number, of, coronal, contrasts, exhibited, within, and, across, languages, in, the, region, dental, consonants, are, made, with, the, tip, or, blade, of, the, tongue, and, the, upper, teeth, they, are, divided, into, two, groups, based, upon, the, part, of, the, tongue, used, to, produce, them, apical, dental, consonants, are, produced, with, the, tongue, tip, touching, the, teeth, interdental, consonants, are, produced, with, the, blade, of, the, tongue, as, the, tip, of, the, tongue, sticks, out, in, front, of, the, teeth, no, language, is, known, to, use, both, contrastively, though, they, may, exist, allophonically, alveolar, consonants, are, made, with, the, tip, or, blade, of, the, tongue, at, the, alveolar, ridge, just, behind, the, teeth, and, can, similarly, be, apical, or, laminal, crosslinguistically, dental, consonants, and, alveolar, consonants, are, frequently, contrasted, leading, to, a, number, of, generalizations, of, crosslinguistic, patterns, the, different, places, of, articulation, tend, to, also, be, contrasted, in, the, part, of, the, tongue, used, to, produce, them, most, languages, with, dental, stops, have, laminal, dentals, while, languages, with, apical, stops, usually, have, apical, stops, languages, rarely, have, two, consonants, in, the, same, place, with, a, contrast, in, laminality, though, taa, x, is, a, counterexample, to, this, pattern, if, a, language, has, only, one, of, a, dental, stop, or, an, alveolar, stop, it, will, usually, be, laminal, if, it, is, a, dental, stop, and, the, stop, will, usually, be, apical, if, it, is, an, alveolar, stop, though, for, example, temne, and, bulgarian, do, not, follow, this, pattern, if, a, language, has, both, an, apical, and, laminal, stop, then, the, laminal, stop, is, more, likely, to, be, affricated, like, in, isoko, though, dahalo, show, the, opposite, pattern, with, alveolar, stops, being, more, affricated, retroflex, consonants, have, several, different, definitions, depending, on, whether, the, position, of, the, tongue, or, the, position, on, the, roof, of, the, mouth, is, given, prominence, in, general, they, represent, a, group, of, articulations, in, which, the, tip, of, the, tongue, is, curled, upwards, to, some, degree, in, this, way, retroflex, articulations, can, occur, in, several, different, locations, on, the, roof, of, the, mouth, including, alveolar, post, alveolar, and, palatal, regions, if, the, underside, of, the, tongue, tip, makes, contact, with, the, roof, of, the, mouth, it, is, sub, apical, though, apical, post, alveolar, sounds, are, also, described, as, retroflex, typical, examples, of, sub, apical, retroflex, stops, are, commonly, found, in, dravidian, languages, and, in, some, languages, indigenous, to, the, southwest, united, states, the, contrastive, difference, between, dental, and, alveolar, stops, is, a, slight, retroflexion, of, the, alveolar, stop, acoustically, retroflexion, tends, to, affect, the, higher, formants, articulations, taking, place, just, behind, the, alveolar, ridge, known, as, post, alveolar, consonants, have, been, referred, to, using, a, number, of, different, terms, apical, post, alveolar, consonants, are, often, called, retroflex, while, laminal, articulations, are, sometimes, called, palato, alveolar, in, the, australianist, literature, these, laminal, stops, are, often, described, as, palatal, though, they, are, produced, further, forward, than, the, palate, region, typically, described, as, palatal, because, of, individual, anatomical, variation, the, precise, articulation, of, palato, alveolar, stops, and, coronals, in, general, can, vary, widely, within, a, speech, community, dorsal, consonants, are, those, consonants, made, using, the, tongue, body, rather, than, the, tip, or, blade, and, are, typically, produced, at, the, palate, velum, or, uvula, palatal, consonants, are, made, using, the, tongue, body, against, the, hard, palate, on, the, roof, of, the, mouth, they, are, frequently, contrasted, with, velar, or, uvular, consonants, though, it, is, rare, for, a, language, to, contrast, all, three, simultaneously, with, jaqaru, as, a, possible, example, of, a, three, way, contrast, velar, consonants, are, made, using, the, tongue, body, against, the, velum, they, are, incredibly, common, cross, linguistically, almost, all, languages, have, a, velar, stop, because, both, velars, and, vowels, are, made, using, the, tongue, body, they, are, highly, affected, by, coarticulation, with, vowels, and, can, be, produced, as, far, forward, as, the, hard, palate, or, as, far, back, as, the, uvula, these, variations, are, typically, divided, into, front, central, and, back, velars, in, parallel, with, the, vowel, space, they, can, be, hard, to, distinguish, phonetically, from, palatal, consonants, though, are, produced, slightly, behind, the, area, of, prototypical, palatal, consonants, uvular, consonants, are, made, by, the, tongue, body, contacting, or, approaching, the, uvula, they, are, rare, occurring, in, an, estimated, 19, percent, of, languages, and, large, regions, of, the, americas, and, africa, have, no, languages, with, uvular, consonants, in, languages, with, uvular, consonants, stops, are, most, frequent, followed, by, continuants, including, nasals, consonants, made, by, constrictions, of, the, throat, are, pharyngeals, and, those, made, by, a, constriction, in, the, larynx, are, laryngeal, laryngeals, are, made, using, the, vocal, folds, as, the, larynx, is, too, far, down, the, throat, to, reach, with, the, tongue, pharyngeals, however, are, close, enough, to, the, mouth, that, parts, of, the, tongue, can, reach, them, radical, consonants, either, use, the, root, of, the, tongue, or, the, epiglottis, during, production, and, are, produced, very, far, back, in, the, vocal, tract, pharyngeal, consonants, are, made, by, retracting, the, root, of, the, tongue, far, enough, to, almost, touch, the, wall, of, the, pharynx, due, to, production, difficulties, only, fricatives, and, approximants, can, be, produced, this, way, epiglottal, consonants, are, made, with, the, epiglottis, and, the, back, wall, of, the, pharynx, epiglottal, stops, have, been, recorded, in, dahalo, voiced, epiglottal, consonants, are, not, deemed, possible, due, to, the, cavity, between, the, glottis, and, epiglottis, being, too, small, to, permit, voicing, glottal, consonants, are, those, produced, using, the, vocal, folds, in, the, larynx, because, the, vocal, folds, are, the, source, of, phonation, and, below, the, oro, nasal, vocal, tract, a, number, of, glottal, consonants, are, impossible, such, as, a, voiced, glottal, stop, three, glottal, consonants, are, possible, a, voiceless, glottal, stop, and, two, glottal, fricatives, and, all, are, attested, in, natural, languages, glottal, stops, produced, by, closing, the, vocal, folds, are, notably, common, in, the, world, s, languages, while, many, languages, use, them, to, demarcate, phrase, boundaries, some, languages, like, arabic, and, huatla, mazatec, have, them, as, contrastive, phonemes, additionally, glottal, stops, can, be, realized, as, laryngealization, of, the, following, vowel, in, this, language, glottal, stops, especially, between, vowels, do, usually, not, form, a, complete, closure, true, glottal, stops, normally, occur, only, when, they, are, geminated, the, larynx, commonly, known, as, the, voice, box, is, a, cartilaginous, structure, in, the, trachea, responsible, for, phonation, the, vocal, folds, chords, are, held, together, so, that, they, vibrate, or, held, apart, so, that, they, do, not, the, positions, of, the, vocal, folds, are, achieved, by, movement, of, the, arytenoid, cartilages, the, intrinsic, laryngeal, muscles, are, responsible, for, moving, the, arytenoid, cartilages, as, well, as, modulating, the, tension, of, the, vocal, folds, if, the, vocal, folds, are, not, close, or, tense, enough, they, will, either, vibrate, sporadically, or, not, at, all, if, they, vibrate, sporadically, it, will, result, in, either, creaky, or, breathy, voice, depending, on, the, degree, if, do, not, vibrate, at, all, the, result, will, be, voicelessness, in, addition, to, correctly, positioning, the, vocal, folds, there, must, also, be, air, flowing, across, them, or, they, will, not, vibrate, the, difference, in, pressure, across, the, glottis, required, for, voicing, is, estimated, at, 1, 2, cm, h, 2, o, 98, 0665, 196, 133, pascals, the, pressure, differential, can, fall, below, levels, required, for, phonation, either, because, of, an, increase, in, pressure, above, the, glottis, superglottal, pressure, or, a, decrease, in, pressure, below, the, glottis, subglottal, pressure, the, subglottal, pressure, is, maintained, by, the, respiratory, muscles, supraglottal, pressure, with, no, constrictions, or, articulations, is, equal, to, about, atmospheric, pressure, however, because, articulations, especially, consonants, represent, constrictions, of, the, airflow, the, pressure, in, the, cavity, behind, those, constrictions, can, increase, resulting, in, a, higher, supraglottal, pressure, according, to, the, lexical, access, model, two, different, stages, of, cognition, are, employed, thus, this, concept, is, known, as, the, two, stage, theory, of, lexical, access, the, first, stage, lexical, selection, provides, information, about, lexical, items, required, to, construct, the, functional, level, representation, these, items, are, retrieved, according, to, their, specific, semantic, and, syntactic, properties, but, phonological, forms, are, not, yet, made, available, at, this, stage, the, second, stage, retrieval, of, wordforms, provides, information, required, for, building, the, positional, level, representation, when, producing, speech, the, articulators, move, through, and, contact, particular, locations, in, space, resulting, in, changes, to, the, acoustic, signal, some, models, of, speech, production, take, this, as, the, basis, for, modeling, articulation, in, a, coordinate, system, that, may, be, internal, to, the, body, intrinsic, or, external, extrinsic, intrinsic, coordinate, systems, model, the, movement, of, articulators, as, positions, and, angles, of, joints, in, the, body, intrinsic, coordinate, models, of, the, jaw, often, use, two, to, three, degrees, of, freedom, representing, translation, and, rotation, these, face, issues, with, modeling, the, tongue, which, unlike, joints, of, the, jaw, and, arms, is, a, muscular, hydrostat, like, an, elephant, trunk, which, lacks, joints, because, of, the, different, physiological, structures, movement, paths, of, the, jaw, are, relatively, straight, lines, during, speech, and, mastication, while, movements, of, the, tongue, follow, curves, straight, line, movements, have, been, used, to, argue, articulations, as, planned, in, extrinsic, rather, than, intrinsic, space, though, extrinsic, coordinate, systems, also, include, acoustic, coordinate, spaces, not, just, physical, coordinate, spaces, models, that, assume, movements, are, planned, in, extrinsic, space, run, into, an, inverse, problem, of, explaining, the, muscle, and, joint, locations, which, produce, the, observed, path, or, acoustic, signal, the, arm, for, example, has, seven, degrees, of, freedom, and, 22, muscles, so, multiple, different, joint, and, muscle, configurations, can, lead, to, the, same, final, position, for, models, of, planning, in, extrinsic, acoustic, space, the, same, one, to, many, mapping, problem, applies, as, well, with, no, unique, mapping, from, physical, or, acoustic, targets, to, the, muscle, movements, required, to, achieve, them, concerns, about, the, inverse, problem, may, be, exaggerated, however, as, speech, is, a, highly, learned, skill, using, neurological, structures, which, evolved, for, the, purpose, the, equilibrium, point, model, proposes, a, resolution, to, the, inverse, problem, by, arguing, that, movement, targets, be, represented, as, the, position, of, the, muscle, pairs, acting, on, a, joint, importantly, muscles, are, modeled, as, springs, and, the, target, is, the, equilibrium, point, for, the, modeled, spring, mass, system, by, using, springs, the, equilibrium, point, model, can, easily, account, for, compensation, and, response, when, movements, are, disrupted, they, are, considered, a, coordinate, model, because, they, assume, that, these, muscle, positions, are, represented, as, points, in, space, equilibrium, points, where, the, spring, like, action, of, the, muscles, converges, gestural, approaches, to, speech, production, propose, that, articulations, are, represented, as, movement, patterns, rather, than, particular, coordinates, to, hit, the, minimal, unit, is, a, gesture, that, represents, a, group, of, functionally, equivalent, articulatory, movement, patterns, that, are, actively, controlled, with, reference, to, a, given, speech, relevant, goal, e, g, a, bilabial, closure, these, groups, represent, coordinative, structures, or, synergies, which, view, movements, not, as, individual, muscle, movements, but, as, task, dependent, groupings, of, muscles, which, work, together, as, a, single, unit, this, reduces, the, degrees, of, freedom, in, articulation, planning, a, problem, especially, in, intrinsic, coordinate, models, which, allows, for, any, movement, that, achieves, the, speech, goal, rather, than, encoding, the, particular, movements, in, the, abstract, representation, coarticulation, is, well, described, by, gestural, models, as, the, articulations, at, faster, speech, rates, can, be, explained, as, composites, of, the, independent, gestures, at, slower, speech, rates, speech, sounds, are, created, by, the, modification, of, an, airstream, which, results, in, a, sound, wave, the, modification, is, done, by, the, articulators, with, different, places, and, manners, of, articulation, producing, different, acoustic, results, because, the, posture, of, the, vocal, tract, not, just, the, position, of, the, tongue, can, affect, the, resulting, sound, the, manner, of, articulation, is, important, for, describing, the, speech, sound, the, words, tack, and, sack, both, begin, with, alveolar, sounds, in, english, but, differ, in, how, far, the, tongue, is, from, the, alveolar, ridge, this, difference, has, large, effects, on, the, air, stream, and, thus, the, sound, that, is, produced, similarly, the, direction, and, source, of, the, airstream, can, affect, the, sound, the, most, common, airstream, mechanism, is, pulmonic, using, the, lungs, but, the, glottis, and, tongue, can, also, be, used, to, produce, airstreams, a, major, distinction, between, speech, sounds, is, whether, they, are, voiced, sounds, are, voiced, when, the, vocal, folds, begin, to, vibrate, in, the, process, of, phonation, many, sounds, can, be, produced, with, or, without, phonation, though, physical, constraints, may, make, phonation, difficult, or, impossible, for, some, articulations, when, articulations, are, voiced, the, main, source, of, noise, is, the, periodic, vibration, of, the, vocal, folds, articulations, like, voiceless, plosives, have, no, acoustic, source, and, are, noticeable, by, their, silence, but, other, voiceless, sounds, like, fricatives, create, their, own, acoustic, source, regardless, of, phonation, phonation, is, controlled, by, the, muscles, of, the, larynx, and, languages, make, use, of, more, acoustic, detail, than, binary, voicing, during, phonation, the, vocal, folds, vibrate, at, a, certain, rate, this, vibration, results, in, a, periodic, acoustic, waveform, comprising, a, fundamental, frequency, and, its, harmonics, the, fundamental, frequency, of, the, acoustic, wave, can, be, controlled, by, adjusting, the, muscles, of, the, larynx, and, listeners, perceive, this, fundamental, frequency, as, pitch, languages, use, pitch, manipulation, to, convey, lexical, information, in, tonal, languages, and, many, languages, use, pitch, to, mark, prosodic, or, pragmatic, information, for, the, vocal, folds, to, vibrate, they, must, be, in, the, proper, position, and, there, must, be, air, flowing, through, the, glottis, phonation, types, are, modeled, on, a, continuum, of, glottal, states, from, completely, open, voiceless, to, completely, closed, glottal, stop, the, optimal, position, for, vibration, and, the, phonation, type, most, used, in, speech, modal, voice, exists, in, the, middle, of, these, two, extremes, if, the, glottis, is, slightly, wider, breathy, voice, occurs, while, bringing, the, vocal, folds, closer, together, results, in, creaky, voice, the, normal, phonation, pattern, used, in, typical, speech, is, modal, voice, where, the, vocal, folds, are, held, close, together, with, moderate, tension, the, vocal, folds, vibrate, as, a, single, unit, periodically, and, efficiently, with, a, full, glottal, closure, and, no, aspiration, if, they, are, pulled, farther, apart, they, do, not, vibrate, and, so, produce, voiceless, phones, if, they, are, held, firmly, together, they, produce, a, glottal, stop, if, the, vocal, folds, are, held, slightly, further, apart, than, in, modal, voicing, they, produce, phonation, types, like, breathy, voice, or, murmur, and, whispery, voice, the, tension, across, the, vocal, ligaments, vocal, cords, is, less, than, in, modal, voicing, allowing, for, air, to, flow, more, freely, both, breathy, voice, and, whispery, voice, exist, on, a, continuum, loosely, characterized, as, going, from, the, more, periodic, waveform, of, breathy, voice, to, the, more, noisy, waveform, of, whispery, voice, acoustically, both, tend, to, dampen, the, first, formant, with, whispery, voice, showing, more, extreme, deviations, holding, the, vocal, folds, more, tightly, together, results, in, a, creaky, voice, the, tension, across, the, vocal, folds, is, less, than, in, modal, voice, but, they, are, held, tightly, together, resulting, in, only, the, ligaments, of, the, vocal, folds, vibrating, the, pulses, are, highly, irregular, with, low, pitch, and, frequency, amplitude, some, languages, do, not, maintain, a, voicing, distinction, for, some, consonants, but, all, languages, use, voicing, to, some, degree, for, example, no, language, is, known, to, have, a, phonemic, voicing, contrast, for, vowels, with, all, known, vowels, canonically, voiced, other, positions, of, the, glottis, such, as, breathy, and, creaky, voice, are, used, in, a, number, of, languages, like, jalapa, mazatec, to, contrast, phonemes, while, in, other, languages, like, english, they, exist, allophonically, there, are, several, ways, to, determine, if, a, segment, is, voiced, or, not, the, simplest, being, to, feel, the, larynx, during, speech, and, note, when, vibrations, are, felt, more, precise, measurements, can, be, obtained, through, acoustic, analysis, of, a, spectrogram, or, spectral, slice, in, a, spectrographic, analysis, voiced, segments, show, a, voicing, bar, a, region, of, high, acoustic, energy, in, the, low, frequencies, of, voiced, segments, in, examining, a, spectral, splice, the, acoustic, spectrum, at, a, given, point, in, time, a, model, of, the, vowel, pronounced, reverses, the, filtering, of, the, mouth, producing, the, spectrum, of, the, glottis, a, computational, model, of, the, unfiltered, glottal, signal, is, then, fitted, to, the, inverse, filtered, acoustic, signal, to, determine, the, characteristics, of, the, glottis, visual, analysis, is, also, available, using, specialized, medical, equipment, such, as, ultrasound, and, endoscopy, legend, unrounded, rounded, vowels, are, broadly, categorized, by, the, area, of, the, mouth, in, which, they, are, produced, but, because, they, are, produced, without, a, constriction, in, the, vocal, tract, their, precise, description, relies, on, measuring, acoustic, correlates, of, tongue, position, the, location, of, the, tongue, during, vowel, production, changes, the, frequencies, at, which, the, cavity, resonates, and, it, is, these, resonances, known, as, formants, which, are, measured, and, used, to, characterize, vowels, vowel, height, traditionally, refers, to, the, highest, point, of, the, tongue, during, articulation, the, height, parameter, is, divided, into, four, primary, levels, high, close, close, mid, open, mid, and, low, open, vowels, whose, height, are, in, the, middle, are, referred, to, as, mid, slightly, opened, close, vowels, and, slightly, closed, open, vowels, are, referred, to, as, near, close, and, near, open, respectively, the, lowest, vowels, are, not, just, articulated, with, a, lowered, tongue, but, also, by, lowering, the, jaw, while, the, ipa, implies, that, there, are, seven, levels, of, vowel, height, it, is, unlikely, that, a, given, language, can, minimally, contrast, all, seven, levels, chomsky, and, halle, suggest, that, there, are, only, three, levels, although, four, levels, of, vowel, height, seem, to, be, needed, to, describe, danish, and, it, is, possible, that, some, languages, might, even, need, five, vowel, backness, is, dividing, into, three, levels, front, central, and, back, languages, usually, do, not, minimally, contrast, more, than, two, levels, of, vowel, backness, some, languages, claimed, to, have, a, three, way, backness, distinction, include, nimboran, and, norwegian, in, most, languages, the, lips, during, vowel, production, can, be, classified, as, either, rounded, or, unrounded, spread, although, other, types, of, lip, positions, such, as, compression, and, protrusion, have, been, described, lip, position, is, correlated, with, height, and, backness, front, and, low, vowels, tend, to, be, unrounded, whereas, back, and, high, vowels, are, usually, rounded, paired, vowels, on, the, ipa, chart, have, the, spread, vowel, on, the, left, and, the, rounded, vowel, on, the, right, together, with, the, universal, vowel, features, described, above, some, languages, have, additional, features, such, as, nasality, length, and, different, types, of, phonation, such, as, voiceless, or, creaky, sometimes, more, specialized, tongue, gestures, such, as, rhoticity, advanced, tongue, root, pharyngealization, stridency, and, frication, are, required, to, describe, a, certain, vowel, knowing, the, place, of, articulation, is, not, enough, to, fully, describe, a, consonant, the, way, in, which, the, stricture, happens, is, equally, important, manners, of, articulation, describe, how, exactly, the, active, articulator, modifies, narrows, or, closes, off, the, vocal, tract, stops, also, referred, to, as, plosives, are, consonants, where, the, airstream, is, completely, obstructed, pressure, builds, up, in, the, mouth, during, the, stricture, which, is, then, released, as, a, small, burst, of, sound, when, the, articulators, move, apart, the, velum, is, raised, so, that, air, cannot, flow, through, the, nasal, cavity, if, the, velum, is, lowered, and, allows, for, air, to, flow, through, the, nose, the, result, in, a, nasal, stop, however, phoneticians, almost, always, refer, to, nasal, stops, as, just, nasals, affricates, are, a, sequence, of, stops, followed, by, a, fricative, in, the, same, place, fricatives, are, consonants, where, the, airstream, is, made, turbulent, by, partially, but, not, completely, obstructing, part, of, the, vocal, tract, sibilants, are, a, special, type, of, fricative, where, the, turbulent, airstream, is, directed, towards, the, teeth, creating, a, high, pitched, hissing, sound, nasals, sometimes, referred, to, as, nasal, stops, are, consonants, in, which, there, s, a, closure, in, the, oral, cavity, and, the, velum, is, lowered, allowing, air, to, flow, through, the, nose, in, an, approximant, the, articulators, come, close, together, but, not, to, such, an, extent, that, allows, a, turbulent, airstream, laterals, are, consonants, in, which, the, airstream, is, obstructed, along, the, center, of, the, vocal, tract, allowing, the, airstream, to, flow, freely, on, one, or, both, sides, laterals, have, also, been, defined, as, consonants, in, which, the, tongue, is, contracted, in, such, a, way, that, the, airstream, is, greater, around, the, sides, than, over, the, center, of, the, tongue, the, first, definition, does, not, allow, for, air, to, flow, over, the, tongue, trills, are, consonants, in, which, the, tongue, or, lips, are, set, in, motion, by, the, airstream, the, stricture, is, formed, in, such, a, way, that, the, airstream, causes, a, repeating, pattern, of, opening, and, closing, of, the, soft, articulator, s, apical, trills, typically, consist, of, two, or, three, periods, of, vibration, taps, and, flaps, are, single, rapid, usually, apical, gestures, where, the, tongue, is, thrown, against, the, roof, of, the, mouth, comparable, to, a, very, rapid, stop, these, terms, are, sometimes, used, interchangeably, but, some, phoneticians, make, a, distinction, in, a, tap, the, tongue, contacts, the, roof, in, a, single, motion, whereas, in, a, flap, the, tongue, moves, tangentially, to, the, roof, of, the, mouth, striking, it, in, passing, during, a, glottalic, airstream, mechanism, the, glottis, is, closed, trapping, a, body, of, air, this, allows, for, the, remaining, air, in, the, vocal, tract, to, be, moved, separately, an, upward, movement, of, the, closed, glottis, will, move, this, air, out, resulting, in, it, an, ejective, consonant, alternatively, the, glottis, can, lower, sucking, more, air, into, the, mouth, which, results, in, an, implosive, consonant, clicks, are, stops, in, which, tongue, movement, causes, air, to, be, sucked, in, the, mouth, this, is, referred, to, as, a, velaric, airstream, during, the, click, the, air, becomes, rarefied, between, two, articulatory, closures, producing, a, loud, click, sound, when, the, anterior, closure, is, released, the, release, of, the, anterior, closure, is, referred, to, as, the, click, influx, the, release, of, the, posterior, closure, which, can, be, velar, or, uvular, is, the, click, efflux, clicks, are, used, in, several, african, language, families, such, as, the, khoisan, and, bantu, languages, the, lungs, drive, nearly, all, speech, production, and, their, importance, in, phonetics, is, due, to, their, creation, of, pressure, for, pulmonic, sounds, the, most, common, kinds, of, sound, across, languages, are, pulmonic, egress, where, air, is, exhaled, from, the, lungs, the, opposite, is, possible, though, no, language, is, known, to, have, pulmonic, ingressive, sounds, as, phonemes, many, languages, such, as, swedish, use, them, for, paralinguistic, articulations, such, as, affirmations, in, a, number, of, genetically, and, geographically, diverse, languages, both, egressive, and, ingressive, sounds, rely, on, holding, the, vocal, folds, in, a, particular, posture, and, using, the, lungs, to, draw, air, across, the, vocal, folds, so, that, they, either, vibrate, voiced, or, do, not, vibrate, voiceless, pulmonic, articulations, are, restricted, by, the, volume, of, air, able, to, be, exhaled, in, a, given, respiratory, cycle, known, as, the, vital, capacity, the, lungs, are, used, to, maintain, two, kinds, of, pressure, simultaneously, to, produce, and, modify, phonation, to, produce, phonation, at, all, the, lungs, must, maintain, a, pressure, of, 3, 5, cm, h, 2, o, higher, than, the, pressure, above, the, glottis, however, small, and, fast, adjustments, are, made, to, the, subglottal, pressure, to, modify, speech, for, suprasegmental, features, like, stress, a, number, of, thoracic, muscles, are, used, to, make, these, adjustments, because, the, lungs, and, thorax, stretch, during, inhalation, the, elastic, forces, of, the, lungs, alone, can, produce, pressure, differentials, sufficient, for, phonation, at, lung, volumes, above, 50, percent, of, vital, capacity, above, 50, percent, of, vital, capacity, the, respiratory, muscles, are, used, to, check, the, elastic, forces, of, the, thorax, to, maintain, a, stable, pressure, differential, below, that, volume, they, are, used, to, increase, the, subglottal, pressure, by, actively, exhaling, air, during, speech, the, respiratory, cycle, is, modified, to, accommodate, both, linguistic, and, biological, needs, exhalation, usually, about, 60, percent, of, the, respiratory, cycle, at, rest, is, increased, to, about, 90, percent, of, the, respiratory, cycle, because, metabolic, needs, are, relatively, stable, the, total, volume, of, air, moved, in, most, cases, of, speech, remains, about, the, same, as, quiet, tidal, breathing, increases, in, speech, intensity, of, 18, db, a, loud, conversation, has, relatively, little, impact, on, the, volume, of, air, moved, because, their, respiratory, systems, are, not, as, developed, as, adults, children, tend, to, use, a, larger, proportion, of, their, vital, capacity, compared, to, adults, with, more, deep, inhales, the, source, filter, model, of, speech, is, a, theory, of, speech, production, which, explains, the, link, between, vocal, tract, posture, and, the, acoustic, consequences, under, this, model, the, vocal, tract, can, be, modeled, as, a, noise, source, coupled, onto, an, acoustic, filter, the, noise, source, in, many, cases, is, the, larynx, during, the, process, of, voicing, though, other, noise, sources, can, be, modeled, in, the, same, way, the, shape, of, the, supraglottal, vocal, tract, acts, as, the, filter, and, different, configurations, of, the, articulators, result, in, different, acoustic, patterns, these, changes, are, predictable, the, vocal, tract, can, be, modeled, as, a, sequence, of, tubes, closed, at, one, end, with, varying, diameters, and, by, using, equations, for, acoustic, resonance, the, acoustic, effect, of, an, articulatory, posture, can, be, derived, the, process, of, inverse, filtering, uses, this, principle, to, analyze, the, source, spectrum, produced, by, the, vocal, folds, during, voicing, by, taking, the, inverse, of, a, predicted, filter, the, acoustic, effect, of, the, supraglottal, vocal, tract, can, be, undone, giving, the, acoustic, spectrum, produced, by, the, vocal, folds, this, allows, quantitative, study, of, the, various, phonation, types, language, perception, is, the, process, by, which, a, linguistic, signal, is, decoded, and, understood, by, a, listener, to, perceive, speech, the, continuous, acoustic, signal, must, be, converted, into, discrete, linguistic, units, such, as, phonemes, morphemes, and, words, to, correctly, identify, and, categorize, sounds, listeners, prioritize, certain, aspects, of, the, signal, that, can, reliably, distinguish, between, linguistic, categories, while, certain, cues, are, prioritized, over, others, many, aspects, of, the, signal, can, contribute, to, perception, for, example, though, oral, languages, prioritize, acoustic, information, the, mcgurk, effect, shows, that, visual, information, is, used, to, distinguish, ambiguous, information, when, the, acoustic, cues, are, unreliable, while, listeners, can, use, a, variety, of, information, to, segment, the, speech, signal, the, relationship, between, acoustic, signal, and, category, perception, is, not, a, perfect, mapping, because, of, coarticulation, noisy, environments, and, individual, differences, there, is, a, high, degree, of, acoustic, variability, within, categories, known, as, the, problem, of, perceptual, invariance, listeners, are, able, to, reliably, perceive, categories, despite, the, variability, in, acoustic, instantiation, to, do, this, listeners, rapidly, accommodate, to, new, speakers, and, will, shift, their, boundaries, between, categories, to, match, the, acoustic, distinctions, their, conversational, partner, is, making, audition, the, process, of, hearing, sounds, is, the, first, stage, of, perceiving, speech, articulators, cause, systematic, changes, in, air, pressure, which, travel, as, sound, waves, to, the, listener, s, ear, the, sound, waves, then, hit, the, listener, s, ear, drum, causing, it, to, vibrate, the, vibration, of, the, ear, drum, is, transmitted, by, the, ossicles, three, small, bones, of, the, middle, ear, to, the, cochlea, the, cochlea, is, a, spiral, shaped, fluid, filled, tube, divided, lengthwise, by, the, organ, of, corti, which, contains, the, basilar, membrane, the, basilar, membrane, increases, in, thickness, as, it, travels, through, the, cochlea, causing, different, frequencies, to, resonate, at, different, locations, this, tonotopic, design, allows, for, the, ear, to, analyze, sound, in, a, manner, similar, to, a, fourier, transform, the, differential, vibration, of, the, basilar, causes, the, hair, cells, within, the, organ, of, corti, to, move, this, causes, depolarization, of, the, hair, cells, and, ultimately, a, conversion, of, the, acoustic, signal, into, a, neuronal, signal, while, the, hair, cells, do, not, produce, action, potentials, themselves, they, release, neurotransmitter, at, synapses, with, the, fibers, of, the, auditory, nerve, which, does, produce, action, potentials, in, this, way, the, patterns, of, oscillations, on, the, basilar, membrane, are, converted, to, spatiotemporal, patterns, of, firings, which, transmit, information, about, the, sound, to, the, brainstem, besides, consonants, and, vowels, phonetics, also, describes, the, properties, of, speech, that, are, not, localized, to, segments, but, greater, units, of, speech, such, as, syllables, and, phrases, prosody, includes, auditory, characteristics, such, as, pitch, speech, rate, duration, and, loudness, languages, use, these, properties, to, different, degrees, to, implement, stress, pitch, accents, and, intonation, for, example, stress, in, english, and, spanish, is, correlated, with, changes, in, pitch, and, duration, whereas, stress, in, welsh, is, more, consistently, correlated, with, pitch, than, duration, and, stress, in, thai, is, only, correlated, with, duration, early, theories, of, speech, perception, such, as, motor, theory, attempted, to, solve, the, problem, of, perceptual, invariance, by, arguing, that, speech, perception, and, production, were, closely, linked, in, its, strongest, form, motor, theory, argues, that, speech, perception, requires, the, listener, to, access, the, articulatory, representation, of, sounds, to, properly, categorize, a, sound, a, listener, reverse, engineers, the, articulation, which, would, produce, that, sound, and, by, identifying, these, gestures, is, able, to, retrieve, the, intended, linguistic, category, while, findings, such, as, the, mcgurk, effect, and, case, studies, from, patients, with, neurological, injuries, have, provided, support, for, motor, theory, further, experiments, have, not, supported, the, strong, form, of, motor, theory, though, there, is, some, support, for, weaker, forms, of, motor, theory, which, claim, a, non, deterministic, relationship, between, production, and, perception, successor, theories, of, speech, perception, place, the, focus, on, acoustic, cues, to, sound, categories, and, can, be, grouped, into, two, broad, categories, abstractionist, theories, and, episodic, theories, in, abstractionist, theories, speech, perception, involves, the, identification, of, an, idealized, lexical, object, based, on, a, signal, reduced, to, its, necessary, components, and, normalizing, the, signal, to, counteract, speaker, variability, episodic, theories, such, as, the, exemplar, model, argue, that, speech, perception, involves, accessing, detailed, memories, i, e, episodic, memories, of, previously, heard, tokens, the, problem, of, perceptual, invariance, is, explained, by, episodic, theories, as, an, issue, of, familiarity, normalization, is, a, byproduct, of, exposure, to, more, variable, distributions, rather, than, a, discrete, process, as, abstractionist, theories, claim, acoustic, phonetics, deals, with, the, acoustic, properties, of, speech, sounds, the, sensation, of, sound, is, caused, by, pressure, fluctuations, which, cause, the, eardrum, to, move, the, ear, transforms, this, movement, into, neural, signals, that, the, brain, registers, as, sound, acoustic, waveforms, are, records, that, measure, these, pressure, fluctuations, articulatory, phonetics, deals, with, the, ways, in, which, speech, sounds, are, made, auditory, phonetics, studies, how, humans, perceive, speech, sounds, due, to, the, anatomical, features, of, the, auditory, system, distorting, the, speech, signal, humans, do, not, experience, speech, sounds, as, perfect, acoustic, records, for, example, the, auditory, impressions, of, volume, measured, in, decibels, db, does, not, linearly, match, the, difference, in, sound, pressure, the, mismatch, between, acoustic, analyses, and, what, the, listener, hears, is, especially, noticeable, in, speech, sounds, that, have, a, lot, of, high, frequency, energy, such, as, certain, fricatives, to, reconcile, this, mismatch, functional, models, of, the, auditory, system, have, been, developed, human, languages, use, many, different, sounds, and, to, compare, them, linguists, must, be, able, to, describe, sounds, in, a, way, that, is, language, independent, speech, sounds, can, be, described, in, a, number, of, ways, most, commonly, speech, sounds, are, referred, to, by, the, mouth, movements, needed, to, produce, them, consonants, and, vowels, are, two, gross, categories, that, phoneticians, define, by, the, movements, in, a, speech, sound, more, fine, grained, descriptors, are, parameters, such, as, place, of, articulation, place, of, articulation, manner, of, articulation, and, voicing, are, used, to, describe, consonants, and, are, the, main, divisions, of, the, international, phonetic, alphabet, consonant, chart, vowels, are, described, by, their, height, backness, and, rounding, sign, language, are, described, using, a, similar, but, distinct, set, of, parameters, to, describe, signs, location, movement, hand, shape, palm, orientation, and, non, manual, features, in, addition, to, articulatory, descriptions, sounds, used, in, oral, languages, can, be, described, using, their, acoustics, because, the, acoustics, are, a, consequence, of, the, articulation, both, methods, of, description, are, sufficient, to, distinguish, sounds, with, the, choice, between, systems, dependent, on, the, phonetic, feature, being, investigated, consonants, are, speech, sounds, that, are, articulated, with, a, complete, or, partial, closure, of, the, vocal, tract, they, are, generally, produced, by, the, modification, of, an, airstream, exhaled, from, the, lungs, the, respiratory, organs, used, to, create, and, modify, airflow, are, divided, into, three, regions, the, vocal, tract, supralaryngeal, the, larynx, and, the, subglottal, system, the, airstream, can, be, either, egressive, out, of, the, vocal, tract, or, ingressive, into, the, vocal, tract, in, pulmonic, sounds, the, airstream, is, produced, by, the, lungs, in, the, subglottal, system, and, passes, through, the, larynx, and, vocal, tract, glottalic, sounds, use, an, airstream, created, by, movements, of, the, larynx, without, airflow, from, the, lungs, click, consonants, are, articulated, through, the, rarefaction, of, air, using, the, tongue, followed, by, releasing, the, forward, closure, of, the, tongue, vowels, are, syllabic, speech, sounds, that, are, pronounced, without, any, obstruction, in, the, vocal, tract, unlike, consonants, which, usually, have, definite, places, of, articulation, vowels, are, defined, in, relation, to, a, set, of, reference, vowels, called, cardinal, vowels, three, properties, are, needed, to, define, vowels, tongue, height, tongue, backness, and, lip, roundedness, vowels, that, are, articulated, with, a, stable, quality, are, called, monophthongs, a, combination, of, two, separate, vowels, in, the, same, syllable, is, a, diphthong, in, the, ipa, the, vowels, are, represented, on, a, trapezoid, shape, representing, the, human, mouth, the, vertical, axis, representing, the, mouth, from, floor, to, roof, and, the, horizontal, axis, represents, the, front, back, dimension, phonetic, transcription, is, a, system, for, transcribing, phones, that, occur, in, a, language, whether, oral, or, sign, the, most, widely, known, system, of, phonetic, transcription, the, international, phonetic, alphabet, ipa, provides, a, standardized, set, of, symbols, for, oral, phones, the, standardized, nature, of, the, ipa, enables, its, users, to, transcribe, accurately, and, consistently, the, phones, of, different, languages, dialects, and, idiolects, the, ipa, is, a, useful, tool, not, only, for, the, study, of, phonetics, but, also, for, language, teaching, professional, acting, and, speech, pathology, while, no, sign, language, has, a, standardized, writing, system, linguists, have, developed, their, own, notation, systems, that, describe, the, handshape, location, and, movement, the, hamburg, notation, system, hamnosys, is, similar, to, the, ipa, in, that, it, allows, for, varying, levels, of, detail, some, notation, systems, such, as, komva, and, the, stokoe, system, were, designed, for, use, in, dictionaries, they, also, make, use, of, alphabetic, letters, in, the, local, language, for, handshapes, whereas, hamnosys, represents, the, handshape, directly, signwriting, aims, to, be, an, easy, to, learn, writing, system, for, sign, languages, although, it, has, not, been, officially, adopted, by, any, deaf, community, yet, unlike, spoken, languages, words, in, sign, languages, are, perceived, with, the, eyes, instead, of, the, ears, signs, are, articulated, with, the, hands, upper, body, and, head, the, main, articulators, are, the, hands, and, arms, relative, parts, of, the, arm, are, described, with, the, terms, proximal, and, distal, proximal, refers, to, a, part, closer, to, the, torso, whereas, a, distal, part, is, further, away, from, it, for, example, a, wrist, movement, is, distal, compared, to, an, elbow, movement, due, to, requiring, less, energy, distal, movements, are, generally, easier, to, produce, various, factors, such, as, muscle, flexibility, and, being, considered, taboo, restrict, what, can, be, considered, a, sign, native, signers, do, not, look, at, their, conversation, partner, s, hands, instead, their, gaze, is, fixated, on, the, face, because, peripheral, vision, is, not, as, focused, as, the, center, of, the, visual, field, signs, articulated, near, the, face, allow, for, more, subtle, differences, in, finger, movement, and, location, to, be, perceived, unlike, spoken, languages, sign, languages, have, two, identical, articulators, the, hands, signers, may, use, whichever, hand, they, prefer, with, no, disruption, in, communication, due, to, universal, neurological, limitations, two, handed, signs, generally, have, the, same, kind, of, articulation, in, both, hands, this, is, referred, to, as, the, symmetry, condition, the, second, universal, constraint, is, the, dominance, condition, which, holds, that, when, two, handshapes, are, involved, one, hand, will, remain, stationary, and, have, a, more, limited, set, of, handshapes, compared, to, the, dominant, moving, hand, additionally, it, is, common, for, one, hand, in, a, two, handed, sign, to, be, dropped, during, informal, conversations, a, process, referred, to, as, weak, drop, just, like, words, in, spoken, languages, coarticulation, may, cause, signs, to, influence, each, other, s, form, examples, include, the, handshapes, of, neighboring, signs, becoming, more, similar, to, each, other, assimilation, or, weak, drop, an, instance, of, deletion
