for, freedom, and, peace, however, the, british, treasury, was, so, weak, that, it, could, not, operate, independently, of, the, united, states, furthermore, the, loss, of, defence, and, financial, roles, undermined, joseph, chamberlain, s, early, 20th, century, vision, of, a, world, empire, that, could, combine, imperial, preference, mutual, defence, and, social, growth, in, addition, the, united, kingdom, s, cosmopolitan, role, in, world, affairs, became, increasingly, limited, especially, with, the, losses, of, india, and, singapore, whilst, british, politicians, at, first, hoped,

to, remain, there, because, they, think, it, is, beneficial, to, them, it, is, mutually, understood, that, it, is, to, the, advantage, of, the, nations, in, the, commonwealth, and, therefore, they, join, at, the, same, time, it, is, made, perfectly, clear, that, each, country, is, completely, free, to, go, its, own, way, it, may, be, that, they, may, go, sometimes, go, so, far, as, to, break, away, from, the, commonwealth, otherwise, apart, from, breaking, the, evil, parts, of, the, association, it, is, better, to, keep, a, co, operative, association, going, which, may, do, good, in, this, world, rather, than, break, it, the, london, declaration, is, often, seen, as, marking, the, beginning, of, the, modern, commonwealth, following, india, s, precedent, other, nations, became, republics, or, constitutional, monarchies, with, their, own, monarchs, whilst, some, countries, retained, the, same, monarch, as, the, united, kingdom, their, monarchies, developed, differently, and, soon, became, essentially, independent, of, the, british, monarchy, the, monarch, is, regarded, as, a, separate, legal, personality, in, each, realm, even, though, the, same, person, is, monarch, of, each, realm, at, a, time, when, germany, and, france, together, with, belgium, italy, luxembourg, and, the, netherlands, were, planning, what, later, became, the, european, union, and, newly,

to, join, the, commonwealth, so, that, it, would, become, a, major, economic, common, market, at, the, time, of, the, suez, crisis, in, 1956, and, in, the, face, of, colonial, unrest, and, international, tensions, french, prime, minister, guy, mollet, proposed, to, british, prime, minister, anthony, eden, that, their, two, countries, be, joined, in, a, union, when, that, proposal, was, turned, down, mollet, suggested, that, france, join, the, commonwealth, possibly, with, a, common, citizenship, arrangement, on, the, irish, basis, these, ideas, faded, away, with, the, end, of, the,

membership, required, dominionhood, the, 1949, london, declaration, ended, this, allowing, republican, and, indigenous, monarchic, members, on, the, condition, that, they, recognised, king, george, vi, as, head, of, the, commonwealth, in, the, wake, of, the, wave, of, decolonisation, in, the, 1960s, these, constitutional, principles, were, augmented, by, political, economic, and, social, principles, the, first, of, these, was, set, out, in, 1961, when, it, was, decided, that, respect, for, racial, equality, would, be, a, requirement, for, membership, leading, directly, to, the, withdrawal, of, south, africa, s, re, application, which, they, were, required, to, make, under, the, formula, of, the, london, declaration, upon, becoming, a, republic, the, 14, points, of, the, 1971, singapore, declaration, dedicated, all, members, to, the, principles, of, world, peace, liberty, human, rights, equality, and, free, trade, these, criteria, were, unenforceable, for, two, decades, until, in, 1991, the, harare, declaration, was, issued, dedicating, the, leaders, to, applying, the, singapore, principles, to, the, completion, of, decolonisation, the, end, of, the, cold, war, and, the, end, of, apartheid, in, south, africa, the, mechanisms, by, which, these, principles, would, be, applied, were, created, and, the, manner, clarified, by, the, 1995, millbrook, commonwealth, action, programme, which, created, the, commonwealth, ministerial, action, group, cmag, which, has, the, power, to, rule, on, whether, members, meet, the, requirements, for, membership, under, the, harare, declaration, also, in, 1995, an, inter, governmental, group, was, created, to, finalise, and, codify, the, full, requirements, for, membership, upon, reporting, in, 1997, as, adopted, under, the, edinburgh, declaration, the, inter, governmental, group, ruled, that, any, future, members, would, as, a, rule, have, to, have, a, direct, constitutional, link, with, an, existing, member, in, addition, to, this, new, rule, the, former, rules, were, consolidated, into, a, single, document, these, requirements, are, that, members, must, accept, and, comply, with, the, harare, principles, be, fully, sovereign, states, recognise, king, charles, iii, as, head, of, the, commonwealth, accept, the, english, language, as, the, means, of, commonwealth, communication, and, respect, the, wishes, of, the, general, population, with, regard, to, commonwealth, membership, these, requirements, had, undergone, review, and, a, report, on, potential, amendments, was, presented, by, the, committee, on, commonwealth, membership, at, the, 2007, commonwealth, heads, of, government, meeting, new, members, were, not, admitted, at, this, meeting, though, applications, for, admission, were, considered, at, the, 2009, chogm, new, members, must, as, a, general, rule, have, a, direct, constitutional, link, to, an, existing, member, in, most, cases, this, is, due, to, being, a, former, colony, of, the, united, kingdom, but, some, have, links, to, other, countries, either, exclusively, or, more, directly, e, g, bangladesh, to, pakistan, samoa, to, new, zealand, papua, new, guinea, to, australia, and, singapore, to, malaysia, mozambique, in, 1995, was, the, first, country, to, join, without, such, a, constitutional, connection, leading, to, the, edinburgh, declaration, and, the, current, membership, guidelines, in, 2009, rwanda, formerly, under, belgian, and, german, rule, joined, consideration, for, rwanda, s, admission, was, considered, an, exceptional, circumstance, by, the, commonwealth, secretariat, rwanda, was, permitted, to, join, despite, the, commonwealth, human, rights, initiative, chri, finding, that, the, state, of, governance, and, human, rights, in, rwanda, does, not, satisfy, commonwealth, standards, and, that, it, does, not, therefore, qualify, for, admission, chri, commented, that, it, does, not, make, sense, to, admit, a, state, that, already, does, not, satisfy, commonwealth, standards, this, would, tarnish, the, reputation, of, the, commonwealth, and, confirm, the, opinion, of, many, people, and, civic, organisations, that, the, leaders, of, its, governments, do, not, really, care, for, democracy, and, human, rights, and, that, its, periodic, solemn, declarations, are, merely, hot, air, in, 2022, the, former, french,

of, values, for, the, commonwealth, without, any, decision, on, how, compliance, with, its, principles, would, be, enforced, the, result, of, the, effort, was, that, a, new, charter, of, the,

market, remained, an, important, advantage, to, the, newly, independent, nations, as, the, united, kingdom, moved, increasingly, close, to, europe, however, the, long, term, ties, began, to, be, in, doubt, by, 1961, with, a, sluggish, economy, the, united, kingdom, attempted, to, join, the, european, economic, community, but, this, was, repeatedly, vetoed, by, charles, de, gaulle, entry, was, finally, achieved, in, 1973, queen, elizabeth, was, one, of, the, few, remaining, links, between, the, uk, and, the, commonwealth, historian, ben, pimlott, argues, that, joining, europe, constituted, the, most, decisive, step, yet, in, the, progress, of, severance, of, familial, ties, between, the, united, kingdom, and, its, former, empire, it, reduced, the, remaining, links, to, sentimental, and,

australia, s, chief, trading, partner, was, being, very, rapidly, replaced, just, at, this, time, by, the, united, states, and, an, economically, resurgent, japan, but, most, people, were, scarcely, aware, of, this, it, was, feared, that, british, entry, into, the, common, market, was, bound, to, mean, abolition, or, at, least, scaling, down, of, preferential, tariff, arrangements, for, australians, goods, although, the, commonwealth, does, not, have, a, multilateral, trade, agreement, research, by, the, royal, commonwealth, society, has, shown, that, trade, with, another,

the, eu, some, in, the, united, kingdom, suggested, the, commonwealth, as, an, alternative, to, its, membership, in, the, european, union, however, it, is, far, from, clear, that, this, would, either, offer, sufficient, economic, benefit, to, replace, the, impact, of, leaving, the, eu, or, be, acceptable, to, other, member, states, although, the, eu, is, already, in, the, process, of, negotiating, free, trade, agreements, with, many, commonwealth, countries, such, as, india, and, canada, it, took, the, eu, almost, ten, years, to, come, to, an, agreement, with, canada, due, to, the, challenge,
