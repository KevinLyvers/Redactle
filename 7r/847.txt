boundaries, in, many, countries, the, term, upper, class, was, intimately, associated, with, hereditary, land, ownership, political, power, was, often, in, the, hands, of, the, landowners, in, many, pre, industrial, societies, despite, there, being, no, legal, barriers, to, land, ownership, for, other, social, classes, upper, class, landowners, in, europe, were, often, also, members, of, the, titled, nobility, though, not, necessarily, the, prevalence, of, titles, of, nobility, varied, widely, from, country, to, country, some, upper, classes, were, almost, entirely, untitled, for, example,

not, be, accorded, as, much, prestige, as, a, former, u, s, president, yet, all, members, of, this, class, are, so, influential, and, wealthy, as, to, be, considered, members, of, the, upper, class,

time, as, a, tiny, group, just, one, quarter, of, 1, percent, of, the, population, and, it, is, not, representative, of, the, rest, of, the, nation, but, its, money, buys, plenty, of, access
