jurisdictions, prohibit, trade, except, under, license, of, many, types, of, drugs, through, the, use, of, drug, prohibition, laws, the, think, tank, global, financial, integrity, s, transnational, crime, and, the, developing, world, report, estimates, the, size, of, the, global, illicit, drug, market, between, us, 426, and, us, 652, billion, in, 2014, alone, with, a, world, gdp, of, us, 78, trillion, in, the, same, year, the, illegal, drug, trade, may, be, estimated, as, nearly, 1, of, total, global, trade, consumption, of, illegal, drugs, is, widespread, globally, and, it, remains, very, difficult, for, local, authorities, to, reduce, the, rates, of, drug, consumption, the, government, of, the, qing, dynasty, issued, edicts, against, opium, smoking, in, 1730, 1796, and, 1800, the, west, prohibited, addictive, drugs, throughout, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, beginning, in, the, 18th, century, british, merchants, from, the, east, india, company, began, to, illegally, sell, opium, to, chinese, merchants, and, by, the, early, 19th, century, an, illegal, drug, trade, in, china, emerged, as, a, result, by, 1838, the, number, of, chinese, opium, addicts, had, grown, to, between, four, and, twelve, million, the, chinese, government, responded, by, enforcing, a, ban, on, the, import, of, opium, this, led, to, the, first, opium, war, 1839, 1842, between, the, united, kingdom, and, qing, dynasty, china, the, british, defeated, the, chinese, and, in, the, resulting, treaty, that, ended, the, war, the, treaty, of, nanking, the, qing, government, was, forced, to, allow, british, merchants, to, sell, indian, grown, opium, trading, in, opium, was, lucrative, and, smoking, it, had, become, common, for, the, chinese, in, the, 19th, century, so, british, merchants, increased, trade, with, the, chinese, the, second, opium, war, broke, out, in, 1856, with, the, british, joined, this, time, by, the, french, the, treaty, of, tianjin, which, concluded, that, conflict, stipulated, that, the, chinese, authorities, would, open, further, ports, to, foreign, trade, including, opium, in, 1868, as, a, result, of, the, increased, use, of, opium, in, britain, the, british, government, restricted, the, sale, of, opium, by, implementing, the, 1868, pharmacy, act, in, the, united, states, control, of, opium, remained, under, the, control, of, individual, us, states, until, the, introduction, of, the, harrison, act, in, 1914, after, 12, international, powers, signed, the, international, opium, convention, in, 1912, between, 1920, and, c, 1933, the, eighteenth, amendment, to, the, united, states, constitution, banned, alcohol, in, the, united, states, prohibition, proved, almost, impossible, to, enforce, and, resulted, in, the, rise, of, organized, crime, including, the, modern, american, mafia, which, identified, enormous, business, opportunities, in, the, manufacturing, smuggling, and, sale, of, illicit, liquor, the, beginning, of, the, 21st, century, saw, drug, use, increase, in, north, america, and, europe, with, a, particularly, increased, demand, for, marijuana, and, cocaine, as, a, result, international, organized, crime, syndicates, such, as, the, sinaloa, cartel, and, ndrangheta, have, increased, cooperation, among, each, other, in, order, to, facilitate, trans, atlantic, drug, trafficking, use, of, another, illicit, drug, hashish, has, also, increased, in, europe, drug, trafficking, is, widely, regarded, by, lawmakers, as, a, serious, offense, around, the, world, penalties, often, depend, on, the, type, of, drug, and, its, classification, in, the, country, into, which, it, is, being, trafficked, the, quantity, trafficked, where, the, drugs, are, sold, and, how, they, are, distributed, if, the, drugs, are, sold, to, underage, people, then, the, penalties, for, trafficking, may, be, harsher, than, in, other, circumstances, drug, smuggling, carries, severe, penalties, in, many, countries, sentencing, may, include, lengthy, periods, of, incarceration, flogging, and, even, the, death, penalty, in, singapore, malaysia, indonesia, and, elsewhere, in, december, 2005, van, tuong, nguyen, a, 25, year,

2, 2, lb, of, cannabis, into, the, country, execution, is, mostly, used, as, a, deterrent, and, many, have, called, upon, much, more, effective, measures, to, be, taken, by, countries, to, tackle, drug, trafficking, for, example, targeting, specific, criminal, organisations, that, are, often, also, active, in, the, smuggling, of, other, goods, i, e, wildlife, and, even, people, in, many, cases, links, between, politicians, and, the, criminal, organisations, have, been, proven, to, exist, in, june, 2021, interpol, revealed, an, operation, in, 92, countries, that, shut, down, 113, 000, websites, and, online, marketplaces, selling, counterfeit, or, illicit, medicines, and, medical, products, a, month, earlier, led, to, the, arrests, of, 227, people, worldwide, recovered, pharmaceutical, products, worth, 23, million, and, led, to, the, seizure, of, approximately, nine, million, devices, and, drugs, including, large, quantities, of, fake, covid, 19, tests, and, face, masks, the, countries, of, drug, production, and, transit, are, some, of, the, most, affected, by, the, trade, though, countries, receiving, the, illegally, imported, substances, are, also, adversely, affected, for, example, ecuador, has, absorbed, up, to, 300, 000, refugees, from, colombia, who, are, running, from, guerrillas, paramilitaries, and, drug, lords, while, some, applied, for, asylum, others, are, still, illegal, immigrants, the, drugs, that, pass, from, colombia, through, ecuador, to, other, parts, of, south, america, create, economic, and, social, problems, honduras, through, which, an, estimated, 79, of, cocaine, passes, on, its, way, to, the, united, states, had, as, of, 2011, the, highest, murder, rate, in, the, world, according, to, the, international, crisis, group, the, most, violent, regions, in, central, america, particularly, along, the, guatemala, honduras, border, are, highly, correlated, with, an, abundance, of, drug, trafficking, activity, in, several, countries, the, illegal, drug, trade, is, thought, to, be, directly, linked, to, violent, crimes, such, as, murder, and, gun, violence, this, is, especially, true, in, all, developing, countries, such, as, honduras, but, is, also, an, issue, for, many, developed, countries, worldwide, in, the, late, 1990s, in, the, united, states, the, federal, bureau, of, investigation, estimated, that, 5, of, murders, were, drug, related, in, colombia, drug, violence, can, be, caused, by, factors, such, as, the, economy, poor, governments, and, no, authority, within, law, enforcement, after, a, crackdown, by, us, and, mexican, authorities, in, the, first, decade, of, the, 21st, century, as, part, of, tightened, border, security, in, the, wake, of, the, september, 11, attacks, border,

the, uk, heroin, is, increasingly, trafficked, from, afghanistan, to, europe, and, america, through, eastern, and, southern, african, countries, this, path, is, known, as, the, southern, route, or, smack, track, repercussions, of, this, trade, include, burgeoning, heroin, use, and, political, corruption, among, intermediary, african, nations, cocaine, produced, in, colombia, and, bolivia, increasingly, has, been, shipped, via, west, africa, especially, in, nigeria, cape, verde, guinea, bissau, cameroon, mali, benin, togo, and, ghana, the, money, is, often, laundered, in, countries, such, as, nigeria, ghana, and, senegal, according, to, the, africa, economic, institute, the, value, of, illicit, drug, smuggling, in, guinea, bissau, is, almost, twice, the, value, of, the, country,

particularly, after, the, end, of, the, cold, war, 1991, borders, were, opened, and, trading, and, customs, agreements, were, signed, so, that, the, routes, expanded, to, include, china, central, asia, and, russia, there, are, therefore, diversified, drug, trafficking, routes, available, today, particularly, in, the, heroin, trade, and, these, thrive, due, to, the, continuous, development, of, new, markets, a, large, amount, of, drugs, are, smuggled, into, europe, from, asia, the, main, sources, of, these, drugs, are, afghanistan, along, with, countries, that, constituted, the, so, called, golden, crescent, from, these, producers, drugs, are, smuggled, into, the, west, and, central, asia, to, its, destinations, in, europe, and, the, united, states, iran, is, now, a, common, route, for,

that, a, majority, of, the, 352, billion, 216bn, of, drug, profits, was, absorbed, into, the, economic, system, as, a, result, in, many, instances, the, money, from, drugs, was, the, only, liquid,

countries, or, banks, that, may, have, received, any, drug, money, saying, that, would, be, inappropriate, because, his, office, is, supposed, to, address, the, problem, not, apportion, blame, though, street, level, drug, sales, are, widely, viewed, as, lucrative, a, study, by, sudhir, venkatesh, suggested, that, many, low, level, employees, receive, low, wages, in, a, study, he, made, in, the, 1990s, working, closely, with, members, of, the, black, gangster, disciple, nation, in, chicago, he, found, that, one, gang, essentially, a, franchise, consisted, of, a, leader, a, college, graduate, named, j, t, three, senior, officers, and, 25, to, 75, street, level, salesmen, foot, soldiers, depending, on, season, selling, crack, cocaine, they, took, in, approximately, 32, 000, per, month, over, a, six, year, period, this, was, spent, as, follows, 5, 000, to, the, board, of, twenty, directors, of, the, black, gangster, disciple, nation, who, oversaw, 100, such, gangs, for, approximately, 500, 000, in, monthly, income, another, 5, 000, monthly, was, paid, for, cocaine, and, 4, 000, for, other, non, wage, expenses, j, t, took, 8, 500, monthly, for, his, own, salary, the, remaining, 9, 500, monthly, went, to, pay, the, employees, a, 7, per, hour, wage, for, officers, and, a, 3, 30, per, hour, wage, for, foot, soldiers, contrary, to, a, popular, image, of, drug, sales, as, a, lucrative, profession, many, of, the, employees, were, living, with, their, mothers, by, necessity, despite, this, the, gang, had, four, times, as, many, unpaid, members, who, dreamed, of, becoming, foot, soldiers, there, are, several, arguments, on, whether, or, not, free, trade, has, a, correlation, to, an, increased, activity, in, the, illicit, drug, trade, currently, the, structure, and, operation, of, the, illicit, drug, industry, is, described, mainly, in, terms, of, an, international, division, of, labor, free, trade, can, open, new, markets, to, domestic, producers, who, would, otherwise, resort, to, exporting, illicit, drugs, additionally, extensive, free, trade, among, states, increases, cross, border, drug, enforcement, and, coordination, between, law, enforcement, agencies, in, different, countries, however, free, trade, also, increases, the, sheer, volume, of, legal, cross, border, trade, and, provides, cover, for, drug, smuggling, by, providing, ample, opportunity, to, conceal, illicit, cargo, in, legal, trade, while, international, free, trade, continues, to, expand, the, volume, of, legal, trade, the, ability, to, detect, and, interdict, drug, trafficking, is, severely, diminished, towards, the, late, 1990s, the, top, ten, seaports, in, the, world, processed, 33, 6, million, containers, free, trade, has, fostered, integration, of, financial, markets, and, has, provided, drug, traffickers, with, more, opportunities, to, launder, money, and, invest, in, other, activities, this, strengthens, the, drug, industry, while, weakening, the, efforts, of, law, enforcement, to, monitor, the, flow, of, drug, money, into, the, legitimate, economy, cooperation, among, cartels, expands, their, scope, to, distant, markets, and, strengthens, their, abilities, to, evade, detection, by, local, law, enforcement, additionally, criminal, organizations, work, together, to, coordinate, money, laundering, activities, by, having, separate, organizations, handle, specific, stages, of, laundering, process, one, organization, structures, the, process, of, how, financial, transactions, will, be, laundered, while, another, criminal, group, provides, the, dirty, money, to, be, cleaned, by, fostering, expansion, of, trade, and, global, transportation, networks, free, trade, encourages, cooperation, and, formation, of, alliances, among,

produced, in, underground, labs, and, in, actual, syrian, pharmaceutical, facilities, is, distributed, to, the, fighters, of, bashar, assad, s, army, interestingly, however, the, quantities, the, country, produces, far, exceed, its, own, military, s, demand, by, some, estimates, this, business, gives, syria, more, money, than, its, entire, legal, export, and, the, regime, constantly, works, to, increase, its, profits, primarily, by, expanding, its, market, reach, to, this, end, criminal, gangs, associated, with, damascus, or, hezbollah, have, built, distribution, networks, for, captagon, in, countries, where, the, drug, was, not, previously, popular, the, effects, of, the, illegal, drug, trade, in, the, united, states, can, be, seen, in, a, range, of, political, economic, and, social, aspects, increasing, drug, related, violence, can, be, tied, to, the, racial, tension, that, arose, during, the, late, 20th, century, along, with, the, political, upheaval, prevalent, throughout, the, 1960s, and, 70s, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, was, a, period, when, increased, wealth, and, increased, discretionary, spending, increased, the, demand, for, illicit, drugs, in, certain,

route, in, the, 1960s, cocaine, became, a, major, drug, product, in, the, later, decades, much, of, the, cocaine, is, smuggled, from, colombia, and, mexico, via, jamaica, this, led, to, several, administrations, combating, the, popularity, of, these, drugs, due, to, the, influence, of, this, development, on, the, us, economy, the, reagan, administration, began, certifying, countries, for, their, attempts, at, controlling, drug, trafficking, this, allowed, the, united, states, to, intervene, in, activities, related, to, illegal, drug, transport, in, latin, america, continuing, into, the, 1980s, the, united, states, instated, stricter, policy, pertaining, to, drug, transit, through, sea, as, a, result, there, was, an, influx, in, drug, trafficking, across, the, mexico, us, border, which, increased, the, drug, cartel, activity, in, mexico, by, the, early, 1990s, so, much, as, 50, of, the, cocaine, available, in, the, united, states, market, originated, from, mexico, and, by, the, 2000s, over, 90, of, the, cocaine, in, the, united, states, was, imported, from, mexico, in, colombia, however, there, was, a, fall, of, the, major, drug, cartels, in, the, mid, 1990s, visible, shifts, occurred, in, the, drug, market, in, the, united, states, between, 1996, and, 2000, us, cocaine, consumption, dropped, by, 11, in, 2008, the, us, government, initiated, another, program, known, as, the, merida, initiative, to, help, combat, drug, trafficking, in, mexico, this, program, increased, us, security, assistance, to, 1, 4, billion, over, several, years, which, helped, supply, mexican, forces, with, high, end, equipment, from, helicopters, to, surveillance, technology, despite, us, aid, mexican, narcogangs, continue, to, outnumber, and, outgun, the, mexican, army, allowing, for, continued, activities, of, drug, cartels, across, the, us, mexico, border, although, narcotics, are, illegal, in, the, us, they, have, become, integrated, into, the, nation, s, culture, and, are, seen, as, a, recreational, activity, by, sections, of, the, population, illicit, drugs, are, considered, to, be, a, commodity, with, strong, demand, as, they, are, typically, sold, at, a, high, value, this, high, price, is, caused, by, a, combination, of, factors, that, include, the, potential, legal, ramifications, that, exist, for, suppliers, of, illicit, drugs, and, their, high, demand, despite, the, constant, effort, by, politicians, to, win, the, war, on, drugs, the, us, is, still, the, world, s, largest, importer, of, illegal, drugs, throughout, the, 20th, century, narcotics, other, than, cocaine, also, crossed, the, mexican, border, meeting, the, us, demand, for, alcohol, during, the, 1920s, prohibition, opiates, in, the, 1940s, marijuana, in, the, 1960s, and, heroin, in, the, 1970s, most, of, the, us, imports, of, drugs, come, from, mexican, drug, cartels, in, the, united, states, around, 195, cities, have, been, infiltrated, by, drug, trafficking, that, originated, in, mexico, an, estimated, 10bn, of, the, mexican, drug, cartel, s, profits, come, from, the, united, states, not, only, supplying, the, mexican, drug, cartels, with, the, profit, necessary, for, survival, but, also, furthering, america, s, economic, dependence, on, drugs, with, a, large, wave, of, immigrants, in, the, 1960s, and, onwards, the, united, states, saw, an, increased, heterogeneity, in, its, public, in, the, 1980s, and, 90s, drug, related, homicide, was, at, a, record, high, this, increase, in, drug, violence, became, increasingly, tied, to, these, ethnic, minorities, though, the, rate, of, violence, varied, tremendously, among, cities, in, america, it, was, a, common, anxiety, in, communities, across, urban, america, an, example, of, this, could, be, seen, in, miami, a, city, with, a, host, of, ethnic, enclaves, between, 1985, and, 1995, the, homicide, rate, in, miami, was, one, of, the, highest, in, the, nation, four, times, the, national, homicide, average, this, crime, rate, was, correlated, with, regions, with, low, employment, and, was, not, entirely, dependent, on, ethnicity, the, baby, boomer, generation, also, felt, the, effects, of, the, drug, trade, in, their, increased, drug, use, from, the, 1960s, to, 80s, along, with, substance, use, criminal, involvement, suicide, and, murder, were, also, on, the, rise, due, to, the, large, amount, of, baby, boomers, commercial, marijuana, use, was, on, the, rise, this, increased, the, supply, and, demand, for, marijuana, during, this, time, period, corruption, in, mexico, has, contributed, to, the, domination, of, mexican, cartels, in, the, illicit, drug, trade, since, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, mexico, s, political, environment, allowed, the, growth, of, drug, related, activity, the, loose, regulation, over, the, transportation, of, illegal, drugs, and, the, failure, to, prosecute, known, drug, traffickers, and, gangs, increased, the, growth, of, the, drug, industry, toleration, of, drug, trafficking, has, undermined, the, authority, of, the, mexican, government, and, has, decreased, the, power, of, law, enforcement, officers, in, regulation, over, such, activities, these, policies, of, tolerance, fostered, the, growing, power, of, drug, cartels, in, the, mexican, economy, and, have, made, drug, traders, wealthier, many, states, in, mexico, lack, policies, that, establish, stability, in, governance, there, also, is, a, lack, of, local, stability, as, mayors, cannot, be, re, elected, this, requires, electing, a, new, mayor, each, term, drug, gangs, have, manipulated, this, using, vacuums, in, local, leadership, to, their, own, advantage, in, 1929, the, institutional, revolutionary, party, pri, was, formed, to, resolve, the, chaos, resulting, from, the, mexican, revolution, over, time, this, party, gained, political, influence, and, had, a, major, impact, on, mexico, s, social, and, economic, policies, the, party, created, ties, with, various, groups, as, a, power, play, in, order, to, gain, influence, and, as, a, result, created, more, corruption, in, the, government, one, such, power, play, was, an, alliance, with, drug, traffickers, this, political, corruption, obscured, justice, making, it, difficult, to, identify, violence, when, it, related, to, drugs, by, the, 1940s, the, tie, between, the, drug, cartels, and, the, pri, had, solidified, this, arrangement, created, immunity, for, the, leaders, of, the, drug, cartels, and, allowed, drug, trafficking, to, grow, under, the, protection, of, the, government, officials, during, the, 1990s, the, pri, lost, some, elections, to, the, new, national, action, party, pan, chaos, again, emerged, as, elected, government, in, mexico, changed, drastically, as, the, pan, party, took, control, drug, cartel, leaders, took, advantage, of, the, ensuing, confusion, and, used, their, existing, influence, to, further, gain, power, instead, of, negotiating, with, the, central, government, as, was, done, with, the, pri, party, drug, cartels, utilized, new, ways, to, distribute, their, supply, and, continued, operating, through, force, and, intimidation, as, mexico, became, more, democratized, the, corruption, fell, from, a, centralized, power, to, the, local, authorities, cartels, began, to, bribe, local, authorities, thus, eliminating, the, structure, and, rules, placed, by, the, government, giving, cartels, more, freedom, as, a, response, mexico, saw, an, increase, in, violence, caused, by, drug, trafficking, the, corruption, cartels, created, resulted, in, distrust, of, government, by, the, mexican, public, this, distrust, became, more, prominent, after, the, collapse, of, the, pri, party, in, response, the, presidents, of, mexico, in, the, late, twentieth, century, and, early, twenty, first, century, implemented, several, different, programs, relating, to, law, enforcement, and, regulation, in, 1993, president, salinas, created, the, national, institute, for, the, combat, of, drugs, in, mexico, from, 1995, to, 1998, president, zedillo, established, policies, regarding, increased, punishment, of, organized, crime, allowing, protected, witnesses, covert, agents, and, seizures, of, goods, and, increasing, the, quality, of, law, enforcement, at, the, federal, level, from, 2001, to, 2005, president, vicente, fox, created, the, federal, agency, of, investigation, these, policies, resulted, in, the, arrests, of, major, drug, trafficking, bosses, over, the, past, few, decades, drug, cartels, have, become, integrated, into, mexico, s, economy, approximately, 500, cities, are, directly, engaged, in, drug, trafficking, and, nearly, 450, 000, people, are, employed, by, drug, cartels, additionally, the, livelihood, of, 3, 2, million, people, is, dependent, on, the, drug, cartels, between, local, and, international, sales, such, as, to, europe, and, the, united, states, drug, cartels, in, mexico, see, a, 25, 30, bn, yearly, profit, a, great, deal, of, which, circulates, through, international, banks, such, as, hsbc, drug, cartels, are, fundamental, in, local, economics, a, percentage, of, the, profits, seen, from, the, trade, are, invested, in, the, local, community, such, profits, contribute, to, the, education, and, healthcare, of, the, community, while, these, cartels, bring, violence, and, hazards, into, communities, they, create, jobs, and, provide, income, for, its, many, members, major, cartels, saw, growth, due, to, a, prominent, set, culture, of, mexican, society, that, created, the, means, for, drug, capital, one, of, the, sites, of, origin, for, drug, trafficking, within, mexico, was, the, state, of, michoac, n, in, the, past, michoac, n, was, mainly, an, agricultural, society, this, provided, an, initial, growth, of, trade, industrialization, of, rural, areas, of, mexico, facilitated, a, greater, distribution, of, drugs, expanding, the, drug, market, into, different, provinces, once, towns, became, industrialized, cartels, such, as, the, sinaloa, cartel, started, to, form, and, expand, the, proliferation, of, drug, cartel, culture, largely, stemmed, from, the, ranchero, culture, seen, in, michoac, n, ranchero, culture, values, the, individual, as, opposed, to, the, society, as, a, whole, this, culture, fostered, the, drug, culture, of, valuing, the, family, that, is, formed, within, the, cartel, this, ideal, allowed, for, greater, organization, within, the, cartels, gangs, play, a, major, role, in, the, activity, of, drug, cartels, ms, 13, and, the, 18th, street, gang, are, notorious, for, their, contributions, and, influence, over, drug, trafficking, throughout, latin, america, ms, 13, has, controlled, much, of, the, activity, in, the, drug, trade, spanning, from, mexico, to, panama, female, involvement, is, present, in, the, mexican, drug, culture, although, females, are, not, treated, as, equals, to, males, they, typically, hold, more, power, than, their, culture, allows, and, acquire, some, independence, the, increase, in, power, has, attracted, females, from, higher, social, classes, financial, gain, has, also, prompted, women, to, become, involved, in, the, illegal, drug, market, many, women, in, the, lower, levels, of, major, drug, cartels, belong, to, a, low, economic, class, drug, trafficking, offers, women, an, accessible, way, to, earn, income, females, from, all, social, classes, have, become, involved, in, the, trade, due, to, outside, pressure, from, their, social, and, economic, environments, it, was, common, for, smugglers, in, colombia, to, import, liquor, alcohol, cigarettes, and, textiles, while, exporting, cocaine, personnel, with, knowledge, of, the, terrain, were, able, to, supply, the, local, market, while, also, exporting, a, large, amount, of, product, the, established, trade, initially, involved, peru, bolivia, colombia, venezuela, and, cuba, peasant, farmers, produced, coca, paste, in, peru, and, bolivia, while, colombian, smugglers, would, process, the, coca, paste, into, cocaine, in, colombia, and, trafficked, product, through, batista, s, cuba, this, trade, route, established, ties, between, cuban, and, colombian, organized, crime, from, cuba, cocaine, would, be, transported, to, miami, florida, and, union, city, new, jersey, quantities, of, the, drug, were, then, smuggled, throughout, the, us, the, international, drug, trade, created, political, ties, between, the, involved, countries, encouraging, the, governments, of, the, countries, involved, to, collaborate, and, instate, common, policies, to, eradicate, drug, cartels, cuba, stopped, being, a, center, for, transport, of, cocaine, following, the, cuban, revolution, and, the, establishment, of, fidel, castro, s, communist, government, in, 1959, as, a, result, miami, and, union, city, became, the, sole, locations, for, trafficking, the, relations, between, cuban, and, colombian, organized, crime, remained, strong, until, the, 1970s, when, colombian, cartels, began, to, vie, for, power, in, the, 1980s, and, 90s, colombia, emerged, as, a, key, contributor, of, the, drug, trade, industry, in, the, western, hemisphere, while, the, smuggling, of, drugs, such, as, marijuana, poppy, opium, and, heroin, became, more, ubiquitous, during, this, time, period, the, activity, of, cocaine, cartels, drove, the, development, of, the, latin, american, drug, trade, the, trade, emerged, as, a, multinational, effort, as, supplies, i, e, coca, plant, substances, were, imported, from, countries, such, as, bolivia, and, peru, were, refined, in, colombian, cocaine, labs, and, smuggled, through, colombia, and, exported, to, countries, such, as, the, us, colombia, has, had, a, significant, role, in, the, illegal, drug, trade, in, latin, america, while, active, in, the, drug, trade, since, the, 1930s, colombia, s, role, in, the, drug, trade, did, not, truly, become, dominant, until, the, 1970s, when, mexico, eradicated, marijuana, plantations, demand, stayed, the, same, colombia, met, much, of, the, demand, by, growing, more, marijuana, grown, in, the, strategic, northeast, region, of, colombia, marijuana, soon, became, the, leading, cash, crop, in, colombia, this, success, was, short, lived, due, to, anti, marijuana, campaigns, that, were, enforced, by, the, us, military, throughout, the, caribbean, instead, drug, traffickers, in, colombia, continued, their, focus, on, exporting, cocaine, having, been, an, export, of, colombia, since, the, early, 1950s, cocaine, remained, popular, for, a, host, of, reasons, colombia, s, location, facilitated, its, transportation, from, south, america, into, central, america, and, then, to, its, destination, of, north, america, this, continued, into, the, 1990s, when, colombia, remained, the, chief, exporter, of, cocaine, the, business, of, drug, trafficking, can, be, seen, in, several, stages, in, colombia, towards, the, latter, half, of, the, 20th, century, colombia, served, as, the, dominant, force, in, the, distribution, and, sale, of, cocaine, by, the, 1980s, as, drug, producers, gained, more, power, they, became, more, centralized, and, organized, into, what, became, drug, cartels, cartels, controlled, the, major, aspects, of, each, stage, in, the, traffic, of, their, product, their, organization, allowed, cocaine, to, be, distributed, in, great, amounts, throughout, the, united, states, by, the, late, 1980s, intra, industry, strife, arose, within, the, cartels, this, stage, was, marked, by, increased, violence, as, different, cartels, fought, for, control, of, export, markets, despite, this, strife, this, power, struggle, led, to, then, having, multiple, producers, of, coca, leaf, farms, this, in, turn, caused, an, improvement, in, quality, control, and, reduction, of, police, interdiction, in, the, distribution, of, cocaine, this, also, led, to, cartels, attempting, to, repatriate, their, earnings, which, would, eventually, make, up, 5, 5, of, colombia, s, gdp, this, drive, to, repatriate, earnings, led, to, the, pressure, of, legitimizing, their, wealth, causing, an, increase, in, violence, throughout, colombia, throughout, the, 1980s, estimates, of, illegal, drug, value, in, colombia, ranged, from, 2bn, to, 4bn, this, made, up, about, 7, 10, of, the, 36bn, estimated, gnp, of, colombia, during, this, decade, in, the, 1990s, the, estimates, of, the, illegal, drug, value, remained, roughly, within, the, same, range, 2, 5bn, as, the, colombian, gnp, rose, throughout, the, 1990s, 68, 5bn, in, 1994, and, 96, 3bn, in, 1997, illegal, drug, values, began, to, comprise, a, decreasing, fraction, of, the, national, economy, by, the, early, 1990s, although, colombia, led, in, the, exportation, of, cocaine, it, found, increasing, confrontations, within, its, state, these, confrontations, were, primarily, between, cartels, and, government, institutions, this, led, to, a, decrease, in, the, drug, trade, s, contribution, to, the, gdp, of, colombia, dropping, from, 5, 5, to, 2, 6, though, a, contributor, of, wealth, the, distribution, of, cocaine, has, had, negative, effects, on, the, socio, political, situation, of, colombia, and, has, weakened, its, economy, as, well, by, the, 1980s, colombian, cartels, became, the, dominant, cocaine, distributors, in, the, us, this, led, to, the, spread, of, increased, violence, throughout, both, latin, america, and, miami, in, the, 1980s, two, major, drug, cartels, emerged, in, colombia, the, medell, n, and, cali, groups, throughout, the, 1990s, however, several, factors, led, to, the, decline, of, these, major, cartels, and, to, the, rise, of, smaller, colombian, cartels, the, us, demand, for, cocaine, dropped, while, colombian, production, rose, pressuring, traffickers, to, find, new, drugs, and, markets, in, this, time, period, there, was, an, increase, in, activity, of, caribbean, cartels, that, led, to, the, rise, of, an, alternate, route, of, smuggling, through, mexico, this, led, to, the, increased, collaboration, between, major, colombian, and, mexican, drug, traffickers, such, drastic, changes, in, the, execution, of, drug, trade, in, colombia, paired, with, the, political, instabilities, and, rise, of, drug, wars, in, medellin, and, cali, gave, way, for, the, rise, of, the, smaller, colombian, drug, trafficking, organizations, and, the, rise, of, heroin, trade, as, the, drug, trade, s, influence, over, the, economy, increased, drug, lords, and, their, networks, grew, in, their, power, and, influence, in, society, the, occurrences, in, drug, related, violence, increased, during, this, time, period, as, drug, lords, fought, to, maintain, their, control, in, the, economy, typically, a, drug, cartel, had, support, networks, that, consisted, of, a, number, of, individuals, these, people, individuals, ranged, from, those, directly, involved, in, the, trade, such, as, suppliers, chemists, transporters, smugglers, etc, as, well, as, those, involved, indirectly, in, the, trade, such, as, politicians, bankers, police, etc, as, these, smaller, colombian, drug, cartels, grew, in, prevalence, several, notable, aspects, of, the, colombian, society, gave, way, for, further, development, of, the, colombian, drug, industry, for, example, until, the, late, 1980s, the, long, term, effects, of, the, drug, industry, were, not, realized, by, much, of, society, additionally, there, was, a, lack, of, regulation, in, prisons, where, captured, traffickers, were, sent, these, prisons, were, under, regulated, under, funded, and, under, staffed, which, allowed, for, the, formation, of, prison, gangs, for, the, smuggling, of, arms, weapons, etc, for, feasible, escapes, and, even, for, captured, drug, lords, to, continue, running, their, businesses, from, prison, since, the, beginning, of, the, 21st, century, the, global, drug, trade, network, witnessed, the, emergence, of, criminal, groups, from, the, western, balkans, as, crucial, players, these, groups, have, moved, up, from, being, small, time, crooks, to, major, drug, distributors, most, of, these, organized, crime, groups, belonged, to, albania, bosnia, and, herzegovina, kosovo, montenegro, north, macedonia, and, serbia, the, illicit, trade, activities, of, the, balkans, primarily, involved, latin, america, western, europe, south, africa, australia, and, turkey, these, groups, keep, their, operations, outside, the, western, balkans, while, staying, connected, to, their, homeland, within, the, network, of, these, groups, the, dealmakers, operate, in, a, proximity, of, supply, sources, and, the, distribution, networks, are, managed, by, foot, soldiers, however, the, bosses, of, the, organized, criminal, groups, stay, and, keep, their, wealth, in, the, united, arab, emirates, the, uae, is, amongst, the, enablers, of, global, corruption, and, illicit, financial, flows, analysts, have, claimed, that, criminal, actors, across, the, world, either, operate, from, or, through, the, emirates, it, was, a, haven, for, criminals, where, the, risk, for, illicit, activities, remains, low, for, the, balkan, criminals, a, growing, trend, was, to, relocate, to, the, uae, which, became, an, attraction, to, dirty, money, and, kingpins, from, several, european, nations, and, the, united, kingdom, besides, dubai, was, also, dubbed, as, the, new, costa, del, crime, replacing, the, crime, hideaway, of, spain, the, costa, del, sol, the, uae, had, poor, regulations, for, money, laundering, and, for, screening, of, suspicious, transactions, the, lack, of, regulations, against, illicit, financial, activities, prompted, the, financial, action, task, force, fatf, to, place, the, gulf, country, on, its, grey, list, in, march, 2022, consequently, the, emirates, remained, a, safe, option, for, the, criminals, nearly, two, thirds, of, the, albanian, criminal, groups, who, were, active, in, trade, of, drugs, like, cocaine, were, believed, to, be, hiding, in, the, uae, one, of, such, individuals, eldi, dizdari, was, accused, of, international, drug, trafficking, and, was, living, in, dubai, research, revealed, that, these, criminals, invested, huge, amounts, in, the, emirates, real, estate, and, other, economical, sectors, to, live, there, another, trafficker, of, cocaine, from, bosnia, edin, ga, anin, was, living, in, the, uae, using, his, extensive, profits, to, buy, property, and, protection, in, the, country, dubbed, as, the, european, escobar, he, connected, the, supply, network, between, production, markets, of, latin, america, and, consumer, markets, of, western, european, he, was, able, to, evade, the, arrest, and, investigations, including, by, the, us, drug, enforcement, administration, by, seeking, shelter, in, the, emirates, while, the, recreational, use, of, and, consequently, the, distribution, of, cannabis, is, illegal, in, most, countries, throughout, the, world, recreational, distribution, is, legal, in, some, countries, such, as, canada, and, medical, distribution, is, permitted, in, some, places, such, as, 38, of, the, 50, us, states, although, importation, and, distribution, is, still, federally, prohibited, beginning, in, 2014, uruguay, became, the, first, country, to, legalize, cultivation, sale, and, consumption, of, cannabis, for, recreational, use, for, adult, residents, in, 2018, canada, became, the, second, country, to, legalize, use, sale, and, cultivation, of, cannabis, the, first, few, weeks, were, met, with, extremely, high, demand, most, shops, being, out, of, stock, after, operating, for, only, four, days, cannabis, use, is, tolerated, in, some, areas, most, notably, the, netherlands, which, has, legalized, the, possession, and, licensed, sale, but, not, cultivation, of, the, drug, many, nations, have, decriminalized, the, possession, of, small, amounts, of, marijuana, due, to, the, hardy, nature, of, the, cannabis, plant, marijuana, is, grown, all, across, the, world, and, is, today, the, world, s, most, popular, illegal, drug, with, the, highest, level, of, availability, cannabis, is, grown, legally, in, many, countries, for, industrial, non, drug, use, known, as, hemp, as, well, cannabis, hemp, may, also, be, planted, for, other, non, drug, domestic, purposes, such, as, seasoning, that, occurs, in, aceh, the, demand, for, cannabis, around, the, world, coupled, with, the, drug, s, relative, ease, of, cultivation, makes, the, illicit, cannabis, trade, one, of, the, primary, ways, in, which, organized, criminal, groups, finance, many, of, their, activities, in, mexico, for, example, the, illicit, trafficking, of, cannabis, is, thought, to, constitute, the, majority, of, many, of, the, cartels, earnings, and, the, main, way, in, which, the, cartels, finance, many, other, illegal, activities, including, the, purchase, of, other, illegal, drugs, for, trafficking, and, for, acquiring, weapons, that, are, ultimately, used, to, commit, murders, causing, a, burgeoning, in, the, homicide, rates, of, many, areas, of, the, world, but, particularly, latin, america, some, studies, show, that, the, increased, legalization, of, cannabis, in, the, united, states, beginning, in, 2012, with, washington, initiative, 502, and, colorado, amendment, 64, has, led, mexican, cartels, to, smuggle, less, cannabis, in, exchange, for, more, heroin, alcohol, in, the, context, of, alcoholic, beverages, rather, than, denatured, alcohol, is, illegal, in, a, number, of, muslim, countries, such, as, saudi, arabia, and, this, has, resulted, in, a, thriving, illegal, trade, in, alcohol, the, manufacture, sale, transportation, import, and, export, of, alcoholic, beverages, were, illegal, in, the, united, states, during, the, time, known, as, the, prohibition, in, the, 1920s, and, early, 1930s, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, most, heroin, was, produced, in, turkey, and, transshipped, in, france, via, the, french, connection, crime, ring, with, much, of, it, arriving, in, the, united, states, this, resulted, in, the, record, setting, april, 26, 1968, seizure, of, 246, lb, 111, 6, kg, of, heroin, smuggled, in, a, vehicle, on, the, ss, france, 1960, ocean, liner, by, the, time, of, the, french, connection, 1971, film, this, route, was, being, supplanted, then, until, c, 2004, the,
