ukrainian, ukrainska, mova, ipa, is, an, east, slavic, language, of, the, indo, european, language, family, spoken, primarily, in, ukraine, it, is, the, native, language, of, a, majority, of, ukrainians, written, ukrainian, uses, the, ukrainian, alphabet, a, variant, of, the, cyrillic, script, the, standard, language, is, studied, by, the, national, academy, of, sciences, of, ukraine, and, potebnia, institute, of, linguistics, comparisons, are, often, made, between, ukrainian, and, russian, another, east, slavic, language, yet, there, is, more, mutual, intelligibility, with, belarusian, and, a, closer, lexical, distance, to, west, slavic, polish, and, south, slavic, bulgarian, ukrainian, is, a, descendant, of, old, east, slavic, a, language, spoken, in, the, medieval, state, of, kievan, rus, in, the, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, the, language, developed, into, ruthenian, where, it, became, an, official, language, before, a, process, of, polonization, began, in, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, by, the, 18th, century, ruthenian, diverged, into, regional, variants, and, the, modern, ukrainian, language, developed, in, the, territory, of, present, day, ukraine, russification, saw, the, ukrainian, language, banned, as, a, subject, from, schools, and, as, a, language, of, instruction, in, the, russian, empire, and, continued, in, various, ways, in, the, soviet, union, even, so, the, language, continued, to, see, use, throughout, the, country, and, remained, particularly, strong, in, western, ukraine, specific, developments, that, led, to, a, gradual, change, of, the, old, east, slavic, vowel, system, into, the, system, found, in, modern, ukrainian, began, approximately, in, the, 12th, 13th, century, that, is, still, at, the, time, of, the, kievan, rus, with, a, lengthening, and, raising, of, the, old, east, slavic, mid, vowels, e, and, o, when, followed, by, a, consonant, and, a, weak, yer, vowel, that, would, eventually, disappear, completely, for, example, old, east, slavic, k, t, ukrainian, kit, cat, via, transitional, stages, such, as, ko, t, ku, t, ky, t, or, similar, or, old, east, slavic, p, t, ukrainian, pit, oven, via, transitional, stages, such, as, p, e, t, p, i, t, or, similar, this, raising, and, other, phonological, developments, of, the, time, such, as, the, merger, of, the, old, east, slavic, vowel, phonemes, i, and, into, the, specifically, ukrainian, phoneme, e, spelled, with, in, the, 13th, 14th, centuries, and, the, fricativisation, of, the, old, east, slavic, consonant, g, probably, first, to, in, the, 13th, century, with, as, a, reflex, in, modern, ukrainian, did, not, happen, in, russian, only, the, fricativisation, of, old, east, slavic, g, occurred, in, belarusian, where, the, present, day, reflex, is, ahatanhel, krymsky, and, aleksey, shakhmatov, assumed, the, existence, of, the, common, spoken, language, of, eastern, slavs, only, in, prehistoric, times, according, to, their, point, of, view, the, diversification, of, the, old, east, slavic, language, took, place, in, the, 8th, or, early, 9th, century, russian, linguist, andrey, zaliznyak, stated, that, the, old, novgorod, dialect, differed, significantly, from, that, of, other, dialects, of, kievan, rus, during, the, 11th, 12th, century, but, started, becoming, more, similar, to, them, around, the, 13th, 15th, centuries, the, modern, russian, language, hence, developed, from, the, fusion, of, this, novgorod, dialect, and, the, common, dialect, spoken, by, the, other, kievan, rus, whereas, the, modern, ukrainian, and, belarusian, languages, developed, from, dialects, which, did, not, differ, from, each, other, in, a, significant, way, ukrainian, linguist, stepan, smal, stotsky, denies, the, existence, of, a, common, old, east, slavic, language, at, any, time, in, the, past, similar, points, of, view, were, shared, by, yevhen, tymchenko, vsevolod, hantsov, olena, kurylo, ivan, ohienko, and, others, according, to, this, theory, the, dialects, of, east, slavic, tribes, evolved, gradually, from, the, common, proto, slavic, language, without, any, intermediate, stages, during, the, 6th, through, 9th, centuries, the, ukrainian, language, was, formed, by, convergence, of, tribal, dialects, mostly, due, to, an, intensive, migration, of, the, population, within, the, territory, of, today, s, ukraine, in, later, historical, periods, this, point, of, view, was, also, supported, by, george, shevelov, s, phonological, studies, which, argue, that, specific, features, were, already, recognizable, in, the, southern, dialects, of, old, east, slavic, seen, as, ancestors, to, ukrainian, as, far, back, as, these, varieties, can, be, documented, as, a, result, of, close, slavic, contacts, with, the, remnants, of, the, scythian, and, sarmatian, population, north, of, the, black, sea, lasting, into, the, early, middle, ages, the, appearance, of, the, voiced, fricative, romanized, h, in, modern, ukrainian, and, some, southern, russian, dialects, is, explained, by, the, assumption, that, it, initially, emerged, in, scythian, and, related, eastern, iranian, dialects, from, earlier, common, proto, indo, european, g, and, g, during, the, 13th, century, when, german, settlers, were, invited, to, ukraine, by, the, princes, of, the, kingdom, of, ruthenia, german, words, began, to, appear, in, the, language, spoken, in, ukraine, their, influence, would, continue, under, poland, not, only, through, german, colonists, but, also, through, the, yiddish, speaking, jews, often, such, words, involve, trade, or, handicrafts, examples, of, words, of, german, or, yiddish, origin, spoken, in, ukraine, include, dakh, roof, rura, pipe, rynok, market, kushnir, furrier, and, majster, master, or, craftsman, in, the, 13th, century, eastern, parts, of, rus, including, moscow, came, under, tatar, rule, until, their, unification, under, the, tsardom, of, muscovy, whereas, the, south, western, areas, including, kyiv, were, incorporated, into, the, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, for, the, following, four, centuries, the, languages, of, the, two, regions, evolved, in, relative, isolation, from, each, other, direct, written, evidence, of, the, existence, of, the, ukrainian, language, dates, to, the, late, 16th, century, by, the, 16th, century, a, peculiar, official, language, formed, a, mixture, of, the, liturgical, standardised, language, of, old, church, slavonic, ruthenian, and, polish, the, influence, of, the, latter, gradually, increased, relative, to, the, former, two, as, the, nobility, and, rural, large, landowning, class, known, as, the, szlachta, was, largely, polish, speaking, documents, soon, took, on, many, polish, characteristics, superimposed, on, ruthenian, phonetics, polish, lithuanian, rule, and, education, also, involved, significant, exposure, to, the, latin, language, much, of, the, influence, of, poland, on, the, development, of, the, ukrainian, language, has, been, attributed, to, this, period, and, is, reflected, in, multiple, words, and, constructions, used, in, everyday, ukrainian, speech, that, were, taken, from, polish, or, latin, examples, of, polish, words, adopted, from, this, period, include, zavzhdy, always, taken, from, old, polish, word, zaw, dy, and, obitsiaty, to, promise, taken, from, polish, obieca, and, from, latin, via, polish, raptom, suddenly, and, meta, aim, or, goal, significant, contact, with, tatars, and, turks, resulted, in, many, turkic, words, particularly, those, involving, military, matters, and, steppe, industry, being, adopted, into, the, ukrainian, language, examples, include, torba, bag, and, tyutyun, tobacco, because, of, the, substantial, number, of, loanwords, from, polish, german, czech, and, latin, early, modern, vernacular, ukrainian, prosta, mova, simple, speech, had, more, lexical, similarity, with, west, slavic, languages, than, with, russian, or, church, slavonic, by, the, mid, 17th, century, the, linguistic, divergence, between, the, ukrainian, and, russian, languages, had, become, so, significant, that, there, was, a, need, for, translators, during, negotiations, for, the, treaty, of, pereyaslav, between, bohdan, khmelnytsky, head, of, the, zaporozhian, host, and, the, russian, state, by, the, 18th, century, ruthenian, had, diverged, into, regional, variants, developing, into, the, modern, belarusian, rusyn, and, ukrainian, languages, the, accepted, chronology, of, ukrainian, divides, the, language, into, old, ukrainian, middle, ukrainian, and, modern, ukrainian, shevelov, explains, that, much, of, this, is, based, on, the, character, of, contemporary, written, sources, ultimately, reflecting, socio, historical, developments, and, he, further, subdivides, the, middle, period, into, three, phases, ukraine, annually, marks, the, day, of, ukrainian, writing, and, language, on, 9, november, the, eastern, orthodox, feast, day, of, nestor, the, chronicler, the, era, of, kievan, rus, c, 880, 1240, is, the, subject, of, some, linguistic, controversy, as, the, language, of, much, of, the, literature, was, purely, or, heavily, old, church, slavonic, some, theorists, see, an, early, ukrainian, stage, in, language, development, here, calling, it, old, ruthenian, others, term, this, era, old, east, slavic, russian, theorists, tend, to, amalgamate, rus, to, the, modern, nation, of, russia, and, call, this, linguistic, era, old, russian, however, according, to, russian, linguist, andrey, zaliznyak, 2012, people, from, the, novgorod, republic, did, not, call, themselves, rus, until, the, 14th, century, earlier, novgorodians, reserved, the, term, rus, for, the, kiev, pereyaslavl, and, chernigov, principalities, at, the, same, time, as, evidenced, by, contemporary, chronicles, the, ruling, princes, and, kings, of, galicia, volhynia, and, kiev, called, themselves, people, of, rus, in, foreign, sources, called, ruthenians, and, galicia, volhynia, has, alternately, been, called, the, principality, or, kingdom, of, ruthenia, also, according, to, andrey, zaliznyak, the, novgorodian, dialect, differed, significantly, from, that, of, other, dialects, of, kievan, rus, during, the, 11th, 12th, century, but, started, becoming, more, similar, to, them, around, 13th, 15th, centuries, the, modern, russian, language, hence, developed, from, the, fusion, of, this, novgorodian, dialect, and, the, common, dialect, spoken, by, the, other, kievan, rus, whereas, the, modern, ukrainian, and, belarusian, languages, developed, from, the, dialects, which, did, not, differ, from, each, other, in, a, significant, way, after, the, fall, of, the, kingdom, of, ruthenia, ukrainians, mainly, fell, under, the, rule, of, lithuania, and, then, poland, local, autonomy, of, both, rule, and, language, was, a, marked, feature, of, lithuanian, rule, in, the, grand, duchy, of, lithuania, old, east, slavic, became, the, language, of, the, chancellery, and, gradually, evolved, into, the, ruthenian, language, polish, rule, which, came, later, was, accompanied, by, a, more, assimilationist, policy, by, the, 1569, union, of, lublin, that, formed, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, a, significant, part, of, ukrainian, territory, was, moved, from, lithuanian, rule, to, polish, administration, resulting, in, cultural, polonization, and, visible, attempts, to, colonize, ukraine, by, the, polish, nobility, many, ukrainian, nobles, learned, the, polish, language, and, converted, to, catholicism, during, that, period, in, order, to, maintain, their, lofty, aristocratic, position, lower, classes, were, less, affected, because, literacy, was, common, only, in, the, upper, class, and, clergy, the, latter, were, also, under, significant, polish, pressure, after, the, union, with, the, catholic, church, most, of, the, educational, system, was, gradually, polonized, in, ruthenia, the, language, of, administrative, documents, gradually, shifted, towards, polish, polish, has, had, heavy, influences, on, ukrainian, particularly, in, western, ukraine, the, southwestern, ukrainian, dialects, are, transitional, to, polish, as, the, ukrainian, language, developed, further, some, borrowings, from, tatar, and, turkish, occurred, ukrainian, culture, and, language, flourished, in, the, sixteenth, and, first, half, of, the, 17th, century, when, ukraine, was, part, of, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, albeit, in, spite, of, being, part, of, the, plc, not, as, a, result, among, many, schools, established, in, that, time, the, kyiv, mohyla, collegium, the, predecessor, of, the, modern, kyiv, mohyla, academy, founded, by, the, orthodox, metropolitan, peter, mogila, was, the, most, important, at, that, time, languages, were, associated, more, with, religions, catholics, spoke, polish, and, members, of, the, orthodox, church, spoke, ruthenian, the, 1654, pereiaslav, agreement, between, cossack, hetmanate, and, alexis, of, russia, divided, ukraine, between, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, and, the, tsardom, of, russia, during, the, following, century, both, monarchies, became, increasingly, intolerant, of, ukrainian, own, cultural, and, political, aspirations, ukrainians, found, themselves, in, a, colonial, situation, the, russian, centre, adopted, the, name, little, russia, for, ukraine, and, little, russian, for, the, language, an, expression, that, originated, in, byzantine, greek, and, may, originally, have, meant, old, original, fundamental, russia, and, had, been, in, use, since, the, 14th, century, ukrainian, high, culture, went, into, a, long, period, of, steady, decline, the, kyiv, mohyla, academy, was, taken, over, by, the, russian, empire, most, of, the, remaining, ukrainian, schools, also, switched, to, polish, or, russian, in, the, territories, controlled, by, these, respective, countries, which, was, followed, by, a, new, wave, of, polonization, and, russification, of, the, native, nobility, gradually, the, official, language, of, ukrainian, provinces, under, poland, was, changed, to, polish, while, the, upper, classes, in, the, russian, part, of, ukraine, used, russian, during, the, 19th, century, a, revival, of, ukrainian, self, identification, manifested, in, the, literary, classes, of, both, russian, empire, dnieper, ukraine, and, austrian, galicia, the, brotherhood, of, sts, cyril, and, methodius, in, kyiv, applied, an, old, word, for, the, cossack, motherland, ukrajina, as, a, self, appellation, for, the, nation, of, ukrainians, and, ukrajins, ka, mova, for, the, language, many, writers, published, works, in, the, romantic, tradition, of, europe, demonstrating, that, ukrainian, was, not, merely, a, language, of, the, village, but, suitable, for, literary, pursuits, however, in, the, russian, empire, expressions, of, ukrainian, culture, and, especially, language, were, repeatedly, persecuted, for, fear, that, a, self, aware, ukrainian, nation, would, threaten, the, unity, of, the, empire, in, 1804, ukrainian, as, a, subject, and, language, of, instruction, was, banned, from, schools, in, 1811, by, order, of, the, russian, government, the, kyiv, mohyla, academy, was, closed, in, 1847, the, brotherhood, of, st, cyril, and, methodius, was, terminated, the, same, year, taras, shevchenko, was, arrested, exiled, for, ten, years, and, banned, for, political, reasons, from, writing, and, painting, in, 1862, pavlo, chubynsky, was, exiled, for, seven, years, to, arkhangelsk, the, ukrainian, magazine, osnova, was, discontinued, in, 1863, the, tsarist, interior, minister, pyotr, valuyev, proclaimed, in, his, decree, that, there, never, has, been, is, not, and, never, can, be, a, separate, little, russian, language, although, the, name, of, ukraine, is, known, since, 1187, it, was, not, applied, to, the, language, until, the, mid, 19th, century, the, linguonym, ukrainian, language, appears, in, yakub, holovatsky, s, book, from, 1849, listed, there, as, a, variant, name, of, the, little, russian, language, in, a, private, letter, from, 1854, taras, shevchenko, lauds, our, splendid, ukrainian, language, valuyev, s, decree, from, 1863, derides, the, little, russian, language, throughout, but, also, mentions, the, so, called, ukrainian, language, once, in, galicia, the, earliest, applications, of, the, term, ukrainian, to, the, language, were, in, the, hyphenated, names, ukrainian, ruthenian, 1866, by, paulin, wi, cicki, or, ruthenian, ukrainian, 1871, by, panteleimon, kulish, and, ivan, puluj, with, non, hyphenated, ukrainian, language, appearing, shortly, thereafter, in, 1878, by, mykhailo, drahomanov, a, following, ban, on, ukrainian, books, led, to, alexander, ii, s, secret, ems, ukaz, which, prohibited, publication, and, importation, of, most, ukrainian, language, books, public, performances, and, lectures, and, even, banned, the, printing, of, ukrainian, texts, accompanying, musical, scores, a, period, of, leniency, after, 1905, was, followed, by, another, strict, ban, in, 1914, which, also, affected, russian, occupied, galicia, for, much, of, the, 19th, century, the, austrian, authorities, demonstrated, some, preference, for, polish, culture, but, the, ukrainians, were, relatively, free, to, partake, in, their, own, cultural, pursuits, in, halychyna, and, bukovina, where, ukrainian, was, widely, used, in, education, and, official, documents, the, suppression, by, russia, hampered, the, literary, development, of, the, ukrainian, language, in, dnipro, ukraine, but, there, was, a, constant, exchange, with, halychyna, and, many, works, were, published, under, austria, and, smuggled, to, the, east, by, the, time, of, the, russian, revolution, of, 1917, and, the, collapse, of, austro, hungary, in, 1918, ukrainians, were, ready, to, openly, develop, a, body, of, national, literature, institute, a, ukrainian, language, educational, system, and, form, an, independent, state, the, ukrainian, people, s, republic, shortly, joined, by, the, west, ukrainian, people, s, republic, during, this, brief, independent, statehood, the, stature, and, use, of, ukrainian, greatly, improved, in, the, russian, empire, census, of, 1897, the, following, picture, emerged, with, ukrainian, being, the, second, most, spoken, language, of, the, russian, empire, according, to, the, imperial, census, s, terminology, the, russian, language, was, subdivided, into, ukrainian, little, russian, what, is, known, as, russian, today, great, russian, and, belarusian, white, russian, the, following, table, shows, the, distribution, of, settlement, by, native, language, in, 1897, in, russian, empire, governorates, guberniyas, that, had, more, than, 100, 000, ukrainian, speakers, although, in, the, rural, regions, of, the, ukrainian, provinces, 80, of, the, inhabitants, said, that, ukrainian, was, their, native, language, in, the, census, of, 1897, for, which, the, results, are, given, above, in, the, urban, regions, only, 32, 5, of, the, population, claimed, ukrainian, as, their, native, language, for, example, in, odesa, then, part, of, the, russian, empire, at, the, time, the, largest, city, in, the, territory, of, current, ukraine, only, 5, 6, of, the, population, said, ukrainian, was, their, native, language, until, the, 1920s, the, urban, population, in, ukraine, grew, faster, than, the, number, of, ukrainian, speakers, this, implies, that, there, was, a, relative, decline, in, the, use, of, ukrainian, language, for, example, in, kyiv, the, number, of, people, stating, that, ukrainian, was, their, native, language, declined, from, 30, 3, in, 1874, to, 16, 6, in, 1917, during, the, seven, decade, long, soviet, era, the, ukrainian, language, held, the, formal, position, of, the, principal, local, language, in, the, ukrainian, ssr, however, practice, was, often, a, different, story, ukrainian, always, had, to, compete, with, russian, and, the, attitudes, of, the, soviet, leadership, towards, ukrainian, varied, from, encouragement, and, tolerance, to, de, facto, banishment, officially, there, was, no, state, language, in, the, soviet, union, until, the, very, end, when, it, was, proclaimed, in, 1990, that, russian, language, was, the, all, union, state, language, and, that, the, constituent, republics, had, rights, to, declare, additional, state, languages, within, their, jurisdictions, still, it, was, implicitly, understood, in, the, hopes, of, minority, nations, that, ukrainian, would, be, used, in, the, ukrainian, ssr, uzbek, would, be, used, in, the, uzbek, ssr, and, so, on, however, russian, was, used, as, the, lingua, franca, in, all, parts, of, the, soviet, union, and, a, special, term, a, language, of, inter, ethnic, communication, was, coined, to, denote, its, status, after, the, death, of, stalin, 1953, a, general, policy, of, relaxing, the, language, policies, of, the, past, was, implemented, 1958, to, 1963, the, khrushchev, era, which, followed, saw, a, policy, of, relatively, lenient, concessions, to, development, of, the, languages, at, the, local, and, republic, level, though, its, results, in, ukraine, did, not, go, nearly, as, far, as, those, of, the, soviet, policy, of, ukrainianization, in, the, 1920s, journals, and, encyclopedic, publications, advanced, in, the, ukrainian, language, during, the, khrushchev, era, as, well, as, transfer, of, crimea, under, ukrainian, ssr, jurisdiction, yet, the, 1958, school, reform, that, allowed, parents, to, choose, the, language, of, primary, instruction, for, their, children, unpopular, among, the, circles, of, the, national, intelligentsia, in, parts, of, the, ussr, meant, that, non, russian, languages, would, slowly, give, way, to, russian, in, light, of, the, pressures, of, survival, and, advancement, the, gains, of, the, past, already, largely, reversed, by, the, stalin, era, were, offset, by, the, liberal, attitude, towards, the, requirement, to, study, the, local, languages, the, requirement, to, study, russian, remained, parents, were, usually, free, to, choose, the, language, of, study, of, their, children, except, in, few, areas, where, attending, the, ukrainian, school, might, have, required, a, long, daily, commute, and, they, often, chose, russian, which, reinforced, the, resulting, russification, in, this, sense, some, analysts, argue, that, it, was, not, the, oppression, or, persecution, but, rather, the, lack, of, protection, against, the, expansion, of, russian, language, that, contributed, to, the, relative, decline, of, ukrainian, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, according, to, this, view, it, was, inevitable, that, successful, careers, required, a, good, command, of, russian, while, knowledge, of, ukrainian, was, not, vital, so, it, was, common, for, ukrainian, parents, to, send, their, children, to, russian, language, schools, even, though, ukrainian, language, schools, were, usually, available, the, number, of, students, in, russian, language, in, ukraine, schools, was, constantly, increasing, from, 14, percent, in, 1939, to, more, than, 30, percent, in, 1962, the, communist, party, leader, from, 1963, to, 1972, petro, shelest, pursued, a, policy, of, defending, ukraine, s, interests, within, the, soviet, union, he, proudly, promoted, the, beauty, of, the, ukrainian, language, and, developed, plans, to, expand, the, role, of, ukrainian, in, higher, education, he, was, removed, however, after, only, a, brief, tenure, for, being, too, lenient, on, ukrainian, nationalism, the, new, party, boss, from, 1972, to, 1989, volodymyr, shcherbytsky, purged, the, local, party, was, fierce, in, suppressing, dissent, and, insisted, russian, be, spoken, at, all, official, functions, even, at, local, levels, his, policy, of, russification, was, lessened, only, slightly, after, 1985, the, management, of, dissent, by, the, local, ukrainian, communist, party, was, more, fierce, and, thorough, than, in, other, parts, of, the, soviet, union, as, a, result, at, the, start, of, the, mikhail, gorbachev, reforms, perebudova, and, hlasnist, ukrainian, for, perestroika, and, glasnost, ukraine, under, shcherbytsky, was, slower, to, liberalize, than, russia, itself, although, ukrainian, still, remained, the, native, language, for, the, majority, in, the, nation, on, the, eve, of, ukrainian, independence, a, significant, share, of, ethnic, ukrainians, were, russified, in, donetsk, there, were, no, ukrainian, language, schools, and, in, kyiv, only, a, quarter, of, children, went, to, ukrainian, language, schools, the, russian, language, was, the, dominant, vehicle, not, just, of, government, function, but, of, the, media, commerce, and, modernity, itself, this, was, substantially, less, the, case, for, western, ukraine, which, escaped, the, artificial, famine, great, purge, and, most, of, stalinism, and, this, region, became, the, center, of, a, hearty, if, only, partial, renaissance, of, the, ukrainian, language, during, independence, since, 1991, ukrainian, has, been, the, official, state, language, in, ukraine, and, the, state, administration, implemented, government, policies, to, broaden, the, use, of, ukrainian, the, educational, system, in, ukraine, has, been, transformed, over, the, first, decade, of, independence, from, a, system, that, is, partly, ukrainian, to, one, that, is, overwhelmingly, so, the, government, has, also, mandated, a,

governing, the, usage, of, the, language, and, introducing, penalties, for, violations, the, literary, ukrainian, language, which, was, preceded, by, old, east, slavic, literature, may, be, subdivided, into, two, stages, during, the, 12th, to, 18th, centuries, what, in, ukraine, is, referred, to, as, old, ukrainian, but, elsewhere, and, in, contemporary, sources, is, known, as, the, ruthenian, language, and, from, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, to, the, present, what, in, ukraine, is, known, as, modern, ukrainian, but, elsewhere, is, known, as, just, ukrainian, influential, literary, figures, in, the, development, of, modern, ukrainian, literature, include, the, philosopher, hryhorii, skovoroda, ivan, kotlyarevsky, mykola, kostomarov, mykhailo, kotsiubynsky, shevchenko, ivan, franko, and, lesia, ukrainka, the, earliest, literary, work, in, the, ukrainian, language, was, recorded, in, 1798, when, kotlyarevsky, a, playwright, from, poltava, in, southeastern, ukraine, published, his, epic, poem, eneyida, a, burlesque, in, ukrainian, based, on, virgil, s, aeneid, his, book, was, published, in, vernacular, ukrainian, in, a, satirical, way, to, avoid, being, censored, and, is, the, earliest, known, ukrainian, published, book, to, survive, through, imperial, and, later, soviet, policies, on, the, ukrainian, language, kotlyarevsky, s, work, and, that, of, another, early, writer, using, the, ukrainian, vernacular, language, petro, artemovsky, used, the, southeastern, dialect, spoken, in, the, poltava, kharkiv, and, southern, kyiven, regions, of, the, russian, empire, this, dialect, would, serve, as, the, basis, of, the, ukrainian, literary, language, when, it, was, developed, by, shevchenko, and, kulish, in, the, mid, 19th, century, in, order, to, raise, its, status, from, that, of, a, dialect, to, that, of, a, language, various, elements, from, folklore, and, traditional, styles, were, added, to, it, the, ukrainian, literary, language, developed, further, when, the, russian, state, banned, the, use, of, the, ukrainian, language, prompting, many, of, its, writers, to, move, to, the, western, ukrainian, region, of, galicia, which, was, under, more, liberal, austrian, rule, after, the, 1860s, the, majority, of, ukrainian, literary, works, were, published, in, austrian, galicia, during, this, period, galician, influences, were, adopted, in, the, ukrainian, literary, language, particularly, with, respect, to, vocabulary, involving, law, government, technology, science, and, administration, the, use, of, the, ukrainian, language, is,

recent, past, when, the, city, was, primarily, russian, speaking, the, shift, is, believed, to, be, caused, mainly, by, an, influx, of, migrants, from, western, regions, of, ukraine, but, also, by, some, kyivans, opting, to, use, the, language, they, speak, at, home, more, widely, in, public, settings, public, signs, and, announcements, in, kyiv, are, displayed, in, ukrainian, in, southern, and,

nationalist, immediately, stopped, publishing, any, dictionaries, and, without, any, discussion, in, a, very, short, time, five, months, created, a, new, spelling, that, unified, as, never, before, the, ukrainian, and, russian, languages, the, letter, was, removed, from, the, alphabet, and, ukrainian, scientific, terminology, was, revised, and, harmonized, with, russian, ukrainian, dictionaries,

in, 1990, the, main, achievements, were, the, restoration, of, the, letter, and, the, accusative, case, in, soviet, times, it, was, optional, and, was, called, the, accusative, form, today, despite, the, existence, of, the, official, spelling, of, the, ukrainian, language, it, is, not, the, only, spelling, standard, in, use, even, in, ukraine, itself, many, publishers, and, publications, use, other, versions, of, the, spelling, which, either, tend, to, skrypnykivka, or, else, differ, from, the, official, rules, of, transmission, of, words, of, foreign, origin, on, 22, may, 2019, the, cabinet, of, ministers, of, ukraine, approved, a, new, version, of, the, orthography, prepared, by, the, ukrainian, national, commission, on, spelling, the, new, edition, brought, to, life, some, features, of, orthography, in, 1928, which, were, part, of, the, ukrainian, orthographic, tradition, at, the, same, time, the, commission, was, guided, by, the, understanding, that, the, language, practice, of, ukrainians, in, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, to, the, beginning, of, the, 21st, century, has, already, become, part, of, the, ukrainian, orthographic, tradition, the, dictionary, of, the, ukrainian, language, in, 11, volumes, contains, 253, 000, entries, lexical, card, catalog, of, the, ukrainian, institute, of, language, studies, has, six, million, cards, as, mentioned, at, the, top, of, the, article, ukrainian, is, most, closely, related, lexically, to, belarusian, and, is, also, closer, to, polish, than, to, russian, for, example, mozhlyvist, possibility, and, polish, mo, liwo, but, russian, vozmozhnost, the, standard, ukrainian, language, which, is, based, on, the, kyiv, poltava, dialect, has, a, plethora, of, false, friends, with, the, standard, russian, language, which, is, based, on, the, dialect, of, moscow, many, people, intentionally, do, or, do, not, use, them, causing, their, language, shift, into, what, is, known, as, surzhyk, where, the, meaning, of, some, words, mimicking, russian, could, be, understood, out, of, context, rather, than, their, literal, meaning, in, ukrainian, ukrainian, has, varying, degrees, of, mutual, intelligibility, with, other, slavic, languages, it, is, closely, related, to, other, east, slavic, languages, with, high, levels, of, mutual, intelligibility, ukrainian, is, considered, to, be, most, closely, related, to, belarusian, the, separation, of, the, east, slavic, languages, is, considered, to, be, relatively, recent, in, the, 19th, century, the, question, of, whether, the, ukrainian, belarusian, and, russian, languages, are, dialects, of, a, single, language, or, three, separate, languages, was, actively, discussed, with, the, debate, affected, by, linguistic, and, political, factors, the, political, situation, ukraine, and, belarus, being, mainly, part, of, the, russian, empire, at, the, time, and, the, historical, existence, of, the, medieval, state, of, kievan, rus, which, occupied, large, parts, of, these, three, nations, led, to, the, creation, of, the, common, classification, known, later, as, the, east, slavic, languages, the, underlying, theory, of, the, grouping, is, their, descent, from, a, common, ancestor, in, modern, times, ukrainian, russian, and, belarusian, are, usually, listed, by, linguists, as, separate, languages, the, ukrainians, were, predominantly, peasants, and, petits, bourgeois, in, 1897, 93, of, ukrainians, were, classified, as, peasants, as, a, result, the, ukrainian, language, was, mostly, vernacular, and, few, earlier, literary, works, from, the, period, can, be, found, in, the, cities, ukrainian, coexisted, with, church, slavonic, a, literary, language, of, religion, that, evolved, from, old, church, slavonic, and, later, polish, and, russian, both, languages, which, were, more, often, used, in, formal, writing, and, communication, during, that, time, the, ukrainian, language, has, the, following, similarities, and, differences, with, other, slavic, languages, unlike, all, other, slavic, languages, ukrainian, has, a, synthetic, future, also, termed, inflectional, future, tense, which, developed, through, the, erosion, and, cliticization, of, the, verb, to, have, or, possibly, to, take, pysat, ymu, infinitive, future, 1st, sg, i, will, write, although, the, inflectional, future, based, on, the, verb, to, have, is, characteristic, of, romance, languages, ukrainian, linguist, a, danylenko, argues, that, ukrainian, differs, from, romance, in, the, choice, of, auxiliary, which, should, be, interpreted, as, to, take, and, not, to, have, he, states, that, late, common, slavic, lcs, had, three, verbs, with, the, same, proto, indo, european, root, h, em, the, three, verbs, became, conflated, in, east, slavic, due, to, morphological, overlap, in, particular, of, im, ti, to, have, and, jati, to, take, as, exemplified, in, the, middle, ukrainian, homonymic, imut, from, both, im, ti, j, m, ti, and, jati, j, ti, analogous, grammaticalization, of, the, type, take, to, take, to, seize, future, is, found, in, chinese, and, hungarian, article, 1, of, the, universal, declaration,
