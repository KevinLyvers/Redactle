consciousness, at, its, simplest, is, awareness, of, internal, and, external, existence, however, its, nature, has, led, to, millennia, of, analyses, explanations, and, debate, by, philosophers, scientists, and, theologians, opinions, differ, about, what, exactly, needs, to, be, studied, or, even, considered, consciousness, in, some, explanations, it, is, synonymous, with, the, mind, and, at, other, times, an, aspect, of, it, in, the, past, it, was, one, s, inner, life, the, world, of, introspection, of, private, thought, imagination, and, volition, today, it, often, includes, any, kind, of, cognition, experience, feeling, or, perception, it, may, be, awareness, awareness, of, awareness, metacognition, or, self, awareness, either, continuously, changing, or, not, the, disparate, range, of, research, notions, and, speculations, raises, a, curiosity, about, whether, the, right, questions, are, being, asked, examples, of, the, range, of, descriptions, definitions, or, explanations, are, ordered, distinction, between, self, and, environment, simple, wakefulness, one, s, sense, of, selfhood, or, soul, explored, by, looking, within, being, a, metaphorical, stream, of, contents, or, being, a, mental, state, mental, event, or, mental, process, of, the, brain, the, words, conscious, and, consciousness, in, the, english, language, date, to, the, 17th, century, and, the, first, recorded, use, of, conscious, as, a, simple, adjective, was, applied, figuratively, to, inanimate, objects, the, conscious, groves, 1643, 175, it, derived, from, the, latin, conscius, con, together, and, scio, to, know, which, meant, knowing, with, or, having, joint, or, common, knowledge, with, another, especially, as, in, sharing, a, secret, thomas, hobbes, in, leviathan, 1651, wrote, where, two, or, more, men, know, of, one, and, the, same, fact, they, are, said, to, be, conscious, of, it, one, to, another, there, were, also, many, occurrences, in, latin, writings, of, the, phrase, conscius, sibi, which, translates, literally, as, knowing, with, oneself, or, in, other, words, sharing, knowledge, with, oneself, about, something, this, phrase, has, the, figurative, sense, of, knowing, that, one, knows, which, is, something, like, the, modern, english, word, conscious, but, it, was, rendered, into, english, as, conscious, to, oneself, or, conscious, unto, oneself, for, example, archbishop, ussher, wrote, in, 1613, of, being, so, conscious, unto, myself, of, my, great, weakness, the, latin, conscientia, literally, knowledge, with, first, appears, in, roman, juridical, texts, by, writers, such, as, cicero, it, means, a, kind, of, shared, knowledge, with, moral, value, specifically, what, a, witness, knows, of, someone, else, s, deeds, although, ren, descartes, 1596, 1650, writing, in, latin, is, generally, taken, to, be, the, first, philosopher, to, use, conscientia, in, a, way, less, like, the, traditional, meaning, and, more, like, the, way, modern, english, speakers, would, use, conscience, his, meaning, is, nowhere, defined, in, search, after, truth, regul, ad, directionem, ingenii, ut, et, inquisitio, veritatis, per, lumen, naturale, amsterdam, 1701, he, wrote, the, word, with, a, gloss, conscienti, vel, interno, testimonio, translatable, as, conscience, or, internal, testimony, it, might, mean, the, knowledge, of, the, value, of, one, s, own, thoughts, the, origin, of, the, modern, concept, of, consciousness, is, often, attributed, to, john, locke, who, defined, the, word, in, his, essay, concerning, human, understanding, published, in, 1690, as, the, perception, of, what, passes, in, a, man, s, own, mind, the, essay, strongly, influenced, 18th, century, british, philosophy, and, locke, s, definition, appeared, in, samuel, johnson, s, celebrated, dictionary, 1755, the, french, term, conscience, is, defined, roughly, like, english, consciousness, in, the, 1753, volume, of, diderot, and, d, alembert, s, encyclop, die, as, the, opinion, or, internal, feeling, that, we, ourselves, have, from, what, we, do, about, forty, meanings, attributed, to, the, term, consciousness, can, be, identified, and, categorized, based, on, functions, and, experiences, the, prospects, for, reaching, any, single, agreed, upon, theory, independent, definition, of, consciousness, appear, remote, scholars, are, divided, as, to, whether, aristotle, had, a, concept, of, consciousness, he, does, not, use, any, single, word, or, terminology, that, is, clearly, similar, to, the, phenomenon, or, concept, defined, by, john, locke, victor, caston, contends, that, aristotle, did, have, a, concept, more, clearly, similar, to, perception, modern, dictionary, definitions, of, the, word, consciousness, evolved, over, several, centuries, and, reflect, a, range, of, seemingly, related, meanings, with, some, differences, that, have, been, controversial, such, as, the, distinction, between, inward, awareness, and, perception, of, the, physical, world, or, the, distinction, between, conscious, and, unconscious, or, the, notion, of, a, mental, entity, or, mental, activity, that, is, not, physical, the, common, usage, definitions, of, consciousness, in, webster, s, third, new, international, dictionary, 1966, are, as, follows, the, cambridge, english, dictionary, defines, consciousness, as, the, state, of, understanding, and, realizing, something, the, oxford, living, dictionary, defines, consciousness, as, he, state, of, being, aware, of, and, responsive, to, one, s, surroundings, person, s, awareness, or, perception, of, something, and, he, fact, of, awareness, by, the, mind, of, itself, and, the, world, philosophers, have, attempted, to, clarify, technical, distinctions, by, using, a, jargon, of, their, own, the, corresponding, entry, in, the, routledge, encyclopedia, of, philosophy, 1998, reads, during, the, early, 19th, century, the, emerging, field, of, geology, inspired, a, popular, metaphor, that, the, mind, likewise, had, hidden, layers, which, recorded, the, past, of, the, individual, 3, by, 1875, most, psychologists, believed, that, consciousness, was, but, a, small, part, of, mental, life, 3, and, this, idea, underlie, the, goal, of, freudian, therapy, to, expose, the, unconscious, layer, of, the, mind, other, metaphors, from, various, sciences, inspired, other, analyses, of, the, mind, for, example, johann, friedrich, herbart, described, ideas, as, being, attracted, and, repulsed, like, magnets, john, stuart, mill, developed, the, idea, of, mental, chemistry, and, mental, compounds, and, edward, b, titchener, sought, the, structure, of, the, mind, by, analyzing, its, elements, the, abstract, idea, of, states, of, consciousness, mirrored, the, concept, of, states, of, matter, in, 1892, william, james, noted, that, the, ambiguous, word, content, has, been, recently, invented, instead, of, object, and, that, the, metaphor, of, mind, as, a, container, seemed, to, minimize, the, dualistic, problem, of, how, states, of, consciousness, can, know, things, or, objects, 465, by, 1899, psychologists, were, busily, studying, the, contents, of, conscious, experience, by, introspection, and, experiment, 365, another, popular, metaphor, was, james, s, doctrine, of, the, stream, of, consciousness, with, continuity, fringes, and, transitions, vii, james, discussed, the, difficulties, of, describing, and, studying, psychological, phenomena, recognizing, that, commonly, used, terminology, was, a, necessary, and, acceptable, starting, point, towards, more, precise, scientifically, justified, language, prime, examples, were, phrases, like, inner, experience, and, personal, consciousness, the, first, and, foremost, concrete, fact, which, every, one, will, affirm, to, belong, to, his, inner, experience, is, the, fact, that, consciousness, of, some, sort, goes, on, states, of, mind, succeed, each, other, in, him, but, everyone, knows, what, the, terms, mean, in, a, rough, way, when, i, say, every, state, or, thought, is, part, of, a, personal, consciousness, personal, consciousness, is, one, of, the, terms, in, question, its, meaning, we, know, so, long, as, no, one, asks, us, to, define, it, but, to, give, an, accurate, account, of, it, is, the, most, difficult, of, philosophic, tasks, the, only, states, of, consciousness, that, we, naturally, deal, with, are, found, in, personal, consciousnesses, minds, selves, concrete, particular, i, s, and, you, s, 152, 153, prior, to, the, 20th, century, philosophers, treated, the, phenomenon, of, consciousness, as, the, inner, world, one, s, own, mind, and, introspection, was, the, mind, attending, to, itself, an, activity, seemingly, distinct, from, that, of, perceiving, the, outer, world, and, its, physical, phenomena, in, 1892, william, james, noted, the, distinction, along, with, doubts, about, the, inward, character, of, the, mind, things, have, been, doubted, but, thoughts, and, feelings, have, never, been, doubted, the, outer, world, but, never, the, inner, world, has, been, denied, everyone, assumes, that, we, have, direct, introspective, acquaintance, with, our, thinking, activity, as, such, with, our, consciousness, as, something, inward, and, contrasted, with, the, outer, objects, which, it, knows, yet, i, must, confess, that, for, my, part, i, cannot, feel, sure, of, this, conclusion, it, seems, as, if, consciousness, as, an, inner, activity, were, rather, a, postulate, than, a, sensibly, given, fact, 467, by, the, 1960s, for, many, philosophers, and, psychologists, who, talked, about, consciousness, the, word, no, longer, meant, the, inner, world, but, an, indefinite, large, category, called, awareness, as, in, the, following, example, it, is, difficult, for, modern, western, man, to, grasp, that, the, greeks, really, had, no, concept, of, consciousness, in, that, they, did, not, class, together, phenomena, as, varied, as, problem, solving, remembering, imagining, perceiving, feeling, pain, dreaming, and, acting, on, the, grounds, that, all, these, are, manifestations, of, being, aware, or, being, conscious, 4, many, philosophers, and, scientists, have, been, unhappy, about, the, difficulty, of, producing, a, definition, that, does, not, involve, circularity, or, fuzziness, in, the, macmillan, dictionary, of, psychology, 1989, edition, stuart, sutherland, emphasized, external, awareness, and, expressed, a, skeptical, attitude, more, than, a, definition, consciousness, the, having, of, perceptions, thoughts, and, feelings, awareness, the, term, is, impossible, to, define, except, in, terms, that, are, unintelligible, without, a, grasp, of, what, consciousness, means, many, fall, into, the, trap, of, equating, consciousness, with, self, consciousness, to, be, conscious, it, is, only, necessary, to, be, aware, of, the, external, world, consciousness, is, a, fascinating, but, elusive, phenomenon, it, is, impossible, to, specify, what, it, is, what, it, does, or, why, it, has, evolved, nothing, worth, reading, has, been, written, on, it, using, awareness, however, as, a, definition, or, synonym, of, consciousness, is, not, a, simple, matter, if, awareness, of, the, environment, is, the, criterion, of, consciousness, then, even, the, protozoans, are, conscious, if, awareness, of, awareness, is, required, then, it, is, doubtful, whether, the, great, apes, and, human, infants, are, conscious, many, philosophers, have, argued, that, consciousness, is, a, unitary, concept, that, is, understood, by, the, majority, of, people, despite, the, difficulty, philosophers, have, had, defining, it, max, velmans, proposed, that, the, everyday, understanding, of, consciousness, uncontroversially, refers, to, experience, itself, rather, than, any, particular, thing, that, we, observe, or, experience, and, he, added, that, consciousness, is, exemplified, by, all, the, things, that, we, observe, or, experience, 4, whether, thoughts, feelings, or, perceptions, velmans, noted, however, as, of, 2009, that, there, was, a, deep, level, of, confusion, and, internal, division, among, experts, about, the, phenomenon, of, consciousness, because, researchers, lacked, a, sufficiently, well, specified, use, of, the, term, to, agree, that, they, are, investigating, the, same, thing, 3, he, argued, additionally, that, pre, existing, theoretical, commitments, to, competing, explanations, of, consciousness, might, be, a, source, of, bias, within, the, modern, consciousness, studies, community, the, technical, phrase, phenomenal, consciousness, is, a, common, synonym, for, all, forms, of, awareness, or, simply, experience, 4, without, differentiating, between, inner, and, outer, or, between, higher, and, lower, types, with, advances, in, brain, research, the, presence, or, absence, of, experienced, phenomena, 3, of, any, kind, underlies, the, work, of, those, neuroscientists, who, seek, to, analyze, the, precise, relation, of, conscious, phenomenology, to, its, associated, information, processing, in, the, brain, 10, this, neuroscientific, goal, is, to, find, the, neural, correlates, of, consciousness, ncc, one, criticism, of, this, goal, is, that, it, begins, with, a, theoretical, commitment, to, the, neurological, origin, of, all, experienced, phenomena, whether, inner, or, outer, also, the, fact, that, the, easiest, content, of, consciousness, to, be, so, analyzed, is, the, experienced, three, dimensional, world, the, phenomenal, world, beyond, the, body, surface, 4, invites, another, criticism, that, most, consciousness, research, since, the, 1990s, perhaps, because, of, bias, has, focused, on, processes, of, external, perception, from, a, history, of, psychology, perspective, julian, jaynes, rejected, popular, but, superficial, views, of, consciousness, 447, especially, those, which, equate, it, with, that, vaguest, of, terms, experience, 8, in, 1976, he, insisted, that, if, not, for, introspection, which, for, decades, had, been, ignored, or, taken, for, granted, rather, than, explained, there, could, be, no, conception, of, what, consciousness, is, 18, and, in, 1990, he, reaffirmed, the, traditional, idea, of, the, phenomenon, called, consciousness, writing, that, its, denotative, definition, is, as, it, was, for, descartes, locke, and, hume, what, is, introspectable, 450, jaynes, saw, consciousness, as, an, important, but, small, part, of, human, mentality, and, he, asserted, there, can, be, no, progress, in, the, science, of, consciousness, until, what, is, introspectable, sharply, distinguished, 447, from, the, unconscious, processes, of, cognition, such, as, perception, reactive, awareness, and, attention, and, automatic, forms, of, learning, problem, solving, and, decision, making, 21, 47, the, cognitive, science, point, of, view, with, an, inter, disciplinary, perspective, involving, fields, such, as, psychology, linguistics, and, anthropology, requires, no, agreed, definition, of, consciousness, but, studies, the, interaction, of, many, processes, besides, perception, for, some, researchers, consciousness, is, linked, to, some, kind, of, selfhood, for, example, to, certain, pragmatic, issues, such, as, the, feeling, of, agency, and, the, effects, of, regret, and, action, on, experience, of, one, s, own, body, or, social, identity, similarly, daniel, kahneman, who, focused, on, systematic, errors, in, perception, memory, and, decision, making, has, differentiated, between, two, kinds, of, mental, processes, or, cognitive, systems, the, fast, activities, that, are, primary, automatic, and, cannot, be, turned, off, 22, and, the, slow, deliberate, effortful, activities, of, a, secondary, system, often, associated, with, the, subjective, experience, of, agency, choice, and, concentration, 13, kahneman, s, two, systems, have, been, described, as, roughly, corresponding, to, unconscious, and, conscious, processes, 8, the, two, systems, can, interact, for, example, in, sharing, the, control, of, attention, 22, while, system, 1, can, be, impulsive, system, 2, is, in, charge, of, self, control, 26, and, when, we, think, of, ourselves, we, identify, with, system, 2, the, conscious, reasoning, self, that, has, beliefs, makes, choices, and, decides, what, to, think, about, and, what, to, do, 21, some, have, argued, that, we, should, eliminate, the, concept, from, our, understanding, of, the, mind, a, position, known, as, consciousness, semanticism, in, medicine, a, level, of, consciousness, terminology, is, used, to, describe, a, patient, s, arousal, and, responsiveness, which, can, be, seen, as, a, continuum, of, states, ranging, from, full, alertness, and, comprehension, through, disorientation, delirium, loss, of, meaningful, communication, and, finally, loss, of, movement, in, response, to, painful, stimuli, issues, of, practical, concern, include, how, the, level, of, consciousness, can, be, assessed, in, severely, ill, comatose, or, anesthetized, people, and, how, to, treat, conditions, in, which, consciousness, is, impaired, or, disrupted, the, degree, or, level, of, consciousness, is, measured, by, standardized, behavior, observation, scales, such, as, the, glasgow, coma, scale, while, historically, philosophers, have, defended, various, views, on, consciousness, surveys, indicate, that, physicalism, is, now, the, dominant, position, among, contemporary, philosophers, of, mind, for, an, overview, of, the, field, approaches, often, include, both, historical, perspectives, e, g, descartes, locke, kant, and, organization, by, key, issues, in, contemporary, debates, an, alternative, is, to, focus, primarily, on, current, philosophical, stances, and, empirical, philosophers, differ, from, non, philosophers, in, their, intuitions, about, what, consciousness, is, while, most, people, have, a, strong, intuition, for, the, existence, of, what, they, refer, to, as, consciousness, skeptics, argue, that, this, intuition, is, too, narrow, either, because, the, concept, of, consciousness, is, embedded, in, our, intuitions, or, because, we, all, are, illusions, gilbert, ryle, for, example, argued, that, traditional, understanding, of, consciousness, depends, on, a, cartesian, dualist, outlook, that, improperly, distinguishes, between, mind, and, body, or, between, mind, and, world, he, proposed, that, we, speak, not, of, minds, bodies, and, the, world, but, of, entities, or, identities, acting, in, the, world, thus, by, speaking, of, consciousness, we, end, up, leading, ourselves, by, thinking, that, there, is, any, sort, of, thing, as, consciousness, separated, from, behavioral, and, linguistic, understandings, ned, block, argued, that, discussions, on, consciousness, often, failed, to, properly, distinguish, phenomenal, p, consciousness, from, access, a, consciousness, though, these, terms, had, been, used, before, block, p, consciousness, according, to, block, is, raw, experience, it, is, moving, colored, forms, sounds, sensations, emotions, and, feelings, with, our, bodies, and, responses, at, the, center, these, experiences, considered, independently, of, any, impact, on, behavior, are, called, qualia, a, consciousness, on, the, other, hand, is, the, phenomenon, whereby, information, in, our, minds, is, accessible, for, verbal, report, reasoning, and, the, control, of, behavior, so, when, we, perceive, information, about, what, we, perceive, is, access, conscious, when, we, introspect, information, about, our, thoughts, is, access, conscious, when, we, remember, information, about, the, past, is, access, conscious, and, so, on, although, some, philosophers, such, as, daniel, dennett, have, disputed, the, validity, of, this, distinction, others, have, broadly, accepted, it, david, chalmers, has, argued, that, a, consciousness, can, in, principle, be, understood, in, mechanistic, terms, but, that, understanding, p, consciousness, is, much, more, challenging, he, calls, this, the, hard, problem, of, consciousness, some, philosophers, believe, that, block, s, two, types, of, consciousness, are, not, the, end, of, the, story, william, lycan, for, example, argued, in, his, book, consciousness, and, experience, that, at, least, eight, clearly, distinct, types, of, consciousness, can, be, identified, organism, consciousness, control, consciousness, consciousness, of, state, event, consciousness, reportability, introspective, consciousness, subjective, consciousness, self, consciousness, and, that, even, this, list, omits, several, more, obscure, forms, there, is, also, debate, over, whether, or, not, a, consciousness, and, p, consciousness, always, coexist, or, if, they, can, exist, separately, although, p, consciousness, without, a, consciousness, is, more, widely, accepted, there, have, been, some, hypothetical, examples, of, a, without, p, block, for, instance, suggests, the, case, of, a, zombie, that, is, computationally, identical, to, a, person, but, without, any, subjectivity, however, he, remains, somewhat, skeptical, concluding, i, don, t, know, whether, there, are, any, actual, cases, of, a, consciousness, without, p, consciousness, but, i, hope, i, have, illustrated, their, conceptual, possibility, sam, harris, observes, at, the, level, of, your, experience, you, are, not, a, body, of, cells, organelles, and, atoms, you, are, consciousness, and, its, ever, changing, contents, seen, in, this, way, consciousness, is, a, subjectively, experienced, ever, present, field, in, which, things, the, contents, of, consciousness, come, and, go, christopher, tricker, argues, that, this, field, of, consciousness, is, symbolized, by, the, mythical, bird, that, opens, the, daoist, classic, the, zhuangzi, this, bird, s, name, is, of, a, flock, peng, yet, its, back, is, countless, thousands, of, miles, across, and, its, wings, are, like, clouds, arcing, across, the, heavens, like, of, a, flock, whose, wings, arc, across, the, heavens, the, wings, of, your, consciousness, span, to, the, horizon, at, the, same, time, the, wings, of, every, other, being, s, consciousness, span, to, the, horizon, you, are, of, a, flock, one, bird, among, kin, mental, processes, such, as, consciousness, and, physical, processes, such, as, brain, events, seem, to, be, correlated, however, the, specific, nature, of, the, connection, is, unknown, the, first, influential, philosopher, to, discuss, this, question, specifically, was, descartes, and, the, answer, he, gave, is, known, as, mind, body, dualism, descartes, proposed, that, consciousness, resides, within, an, immaterial, domain, he, called, res, cogitans, the, realm, of, thought, in, contrast, to, the, domain, of, material, things, which, he, called, res, extensa, the, realm, of, extension, he, suggested, that, the, interaction, between, these, two, domains, occurs, inside, the, brain, perhaps, in, a, small, midline, structure, called, the, pineal, gland, although, it, is, widely, accepted, that, descartes, explained, the, problem, cogently, few, later, philosophers, have, been, happy, with, his, solution, and, his, ideas, about, the, pineal, gland, have, especially, been, ridiculed, however, no, alternative, solution, has, gained, general, acceptance, proposed, solutions, can, be, divided, broadly, into, two, categories, dualist, solutions, that, maintain, descartes, s, rigid, distinction, between, the, realm, of, consciousness, and, the, realm, of, matter, but, give, different, answers, for, how, the, two, realms, relate, to, each, other, and, monist, solutions, that, maintain, that, there, is, really, only, one, realm, of, being, of, which, consciousness, and, matter, are, both, aspects, each, of, these, categories, itself, contains, numerous, variants, the, two, main, types, of, dualism, are, substance, dualism, which, holds, that, the, mind, is, formed, of, a, distinct, type, of, substance, not, governed, by, the, laws, of, physics, and, property, dualism, which, holds, that, the, laws, of, physics, are, universally, valid, but, cannot, be, used, to, explain, the, mind, the, three, main, types, of, monism, are, physicalism, which, holds, that, the, mind, consists, of, matter, organized, in, a, particular, way, idealism, which, holds, that, only, thought, or, experience, truly, exists, and, matter, is, merely, an, illusion, and, neutral, monism, which, holds, that, both, mind, and, matter, are, aspects, of, a, distinct, essence, that, is, itself, identical, to, neither, of, them, there, are, also, however, a, large, number, of, idiosyncratic, theories, that, cannot, cleanly, be, assigned, to, any, of, these, schools, of, thought, since, the, dawn, of, newtonian, science, with, its, vision, of, simple, mechanical, principles, governing, the, entire, universe, some, philosophers, have, been, tempted, by, the, idea, that, consciousness, could, be, explained, in, purely, physical, terms, the, first, influential, writer, to, propose, such, an, idea, explicitly, was, julien, offray, de, la, mettrie, in, his, book, man, a, machine, l, homme, machine, his, arguments, however, were, very, abstract, the, most, influential, modern, physical, theories, of, consciousness, are, based, on, psychology, and, neuroscience, theories, proposed, by, neuroscientists, such, as, gerald, edelman, and, antonio, damasio, and, by, philosophers, such, as, daniel, dennett, seek, to, explain, consciousness, in, terms, of, neural, events, occurring, within, the, brain, many, other, neuroscientists, such, as, christof, koch, have, explored, the, neural, basis, of, consciousness, without, attempting, to, frame, all, encompassing, global, theories, at, the, same, time, computer, scientists, working, in, the, field, of, artificial, intelligence, have, pursued, the, goal, of, creating, digital, computer, programs, that, can, simulate, or, embody, consciousness, a, few, theoretical, physicists, have, argued, that, classical, physics, is, intrinsically, incapable, of, explaining, the, holistic, aspects, of, consciousness, but, that, quantum, theory, may, provide, the, missing, ingredients, several, theorists, have, therefore, proposed, quantum, mind, qm, theories, of, consciousness, notable, theories, falling, into, this, category, include, the, holonomic, brain, theory, of, karl, pribram, and, david, bohm, and, the, orch, or, theory, formulated, by, stuart, hameroff, and, roger, penrose, some, of, these, qm, theories, offer, descriptions, of, phenomenal, consciousness, as, well, as, qm, interpretations, of, access, consciousness, none, of, the, quantum, mechanical, theories, have, been, confirmed, by, experiment, recent, publications, by, g, guerreshi, j, cia, s, popescu, and, h, briegel, could, falsify, proposals, such, as, those, of, hameroff, which, rely, on, quantum, entanglement, in, protein, at, the, present, time, many, scientists, and, philosophers, consider, the, arguments, for, an, important, role, of, quantum, phenomena, to, be, unconvincing, empirical, evidence, is, against, the, notion, of, quantum, consciousness, an, experiment, about, wave, function, collapse, led, by, catalina, curceanu, in, 2022, suggests, that, quantum, consciousness, as, suggested, by, roger, penrose, and, stuart, hameroff, is, highly, implausible, apart, from, the, general, question, of, the, hard, problem, of, consciousness, which, is, roughly, speaking, the, question, of, how, mental, experience, can, arise, from, a, physical, basis, a, more, specialized, question, is, how, to, square, the, subjective, notion, that, we, are, in, control, of, our, decisions, at, least, in, some, small, measure, with, the, customary, view, of, causality, that, subsequent, events, are, caused, by, prior, events, the, topic, of, free, will, is, the, philosophical, and, scientific, examination, of, this, conundrum, many, philosophers, consider, experience, to, be, the, essence, of, consciousness, and, believe, that, experience, can, only, fully, be, known, from, the, inside, subjectively, the, problem, of, other, minds, is, a, philosophical, problem, traditionally, stated, as, the, following, epistemological, question, given, that, i, can, only, observe, the, behavior, of, others, how, can, i, know, that, others, have, minds, the, problem, of, other, minds, is, particularly, acute, for, people, who, believe, in, the, possibility, of, philosophical, zombies, that, is, people, who, think, it, is, possible, in, principle, to, have, an, entity, that, is, physically, indistinguishable, from, a, human, being, and, behaves, like, a, human, being, in, every, way, but, nevertheless, lacks, consciousness, related, issues, have, also, been, studied, extensively, by, greg, littmann, of, the, university, of, illinois, and, by, colin, allen, a, professor, at, the, university, of, pittsburgh, regarding, the, literature, and, research, studying, artificial, intelligence, in, androids, the, most, commonly, given, answer, is, that, we, attribute, consciousness, to, other, people, because, we, see, that, they, resemble, us, in, appearance, and, behavior, we, reason, that, if, they, look, like, us, and, act, like, us, they, must, be, like, us, in, other, ways, including, having, experiences, of, the, sort, that, we, do, there, are, however, a, variety, of, problems, with, that, explanation, for, one, thing, it, seems, to, violate, the, principle, of, parsimony, by, postulating, an, invisible, entity, that, is, not, necessary, to, explain, what, we, observe, some, philosophers, such, as, daniel, dennett, in, a, research, paper, titled, the, unimagined, preposterousness, of, zombies, argue, that, people, who, give, this, explanation, do, not, really, understand, what, they, are, saying, more, broadly, philosophers, who, do, not, accept, the, possibility, of, zombies, generally, believe, that, consciousness, is, reflected, in, behavior, including, verbal, behavior, and, that, we, attribute, consciousness, on, the, basis, of, behavior, a, more, straightforward, way, of, saying, this, is, that, we, attribute, experiences, to, people, because, of, what, they, can, do, including, the, fact, that, they, can, tell, us, about, their, experiences, for, many, decades, consciousness, as, a, research, topic, was, avoided, by, the, majority, of, mainstream, scientists, because, of, a, general, feeling, that, a, phenomenon, defined, in, subjective, terms, could, not, properly, be, studied, using, objective, experimental, methods, in, 1975, george, mandler, published, an, influential, psychological, study, which, distinguished, between, slow, serial, and, limited, conscious, processes, and, fast, parallel, and, extensive, unconscious, ones, the, science, and, religion, forum, 1984, annual, conference, from, artificial, intelligence, to, human, consciousness, identified, the, nature, of, consciousness, as, a, matter, for, investigation, donald, michie, was, a, keynote, speaker, starting, in, the, 1980s, an, expanding, community, of, neuroscientists, and, psychologists, have, associated, themselves, with, a, field, called, consciousness, studies, giving, rise, to, a, stream, of, experimental, work, published, in, books, journals, such, as, consciousness, and, cognition, frontiers, in, consciousness, research, psyche, and, the, journal, of, consciousness, studies, along, with, regular, conferences, organized, by, groups, such, as, the, association, for, the, scientific, study, of, consciousness, and, the, society, for, consciousness, studies, modern, medical, and, psychological, investigations, into, consciousness, are, based, on, psychological, experiments, including, for, example, the, investigation, of, priming, effects, using, subliminal, stimuli, and, on, case, studies, of, alterations, in, consciousness, produced, by, trauma, illness, or, drugs, broadly, viewed, scientific, approaches, are, based, on, two, core, concepts, the, first, identifies, the, content, of, consciousness, with, the, experiences, that, are, reported, by, human, subjects, the, second, makes, use, of, the, concept, of, consciousness, that, has, been, developed, by, neurologists, and, other, medical, professionals, who, deal, with, patients, whose, behavior, is, impaired, in, either, case, the, ultimate, goals, are, to, develop, techniques, for, assessing, consciousness, objectively, in, humans, as, well, as, other, animals, and, to, understand, the, neural, and, psychological, mechanisms, that, underlie, it, experimental, research, on, consciousness, presents, special, difficulties, due, to, the, lack, of, a, universally, accepted, operational, definition, in, the, majority, of, experiments, that, are, specifically, about, consciousness, the, subjects, are, human, and, the, criterion, used, is, verbal, report, in, other, words, subjects, are, asked, to, describe, their, experiences, and, their, descriptions, are, treated, as, observations, of, the, contents, of, consciousness, for, example, subjects, who, stare, continuously, at, a, necker, cube, usually, report, that, they, experience, it, flipping, between, two, 3d, configurations, even, though, the, stimulus, itself, remains, the, same, the, objective, is, to, understand, the, relationship, between, the, conscious, awareness, of, stimuli, as, indicated, by, verbal, report, and, the, effects, the, stimuli, have, on, brain, activity, and, behavior, in, several, paradigms, such, as, the, technique, of, response, priming, the, behavior, of, subjects, is, clearly, influenced, by, stimuli, for, which, they, report, no, awareness, and, suitable, experimental, manipulations, can, lead, to, increasing, priming, effects, despite, decreasing, prime, identification, double, dissociation, verbal, report, is, widely, considered, to, be, the, most, reliable, indicator, of, consciousness, but, it, raises, a, number, of, issues, for, one, thing, if, verbal, reports, are, treated, as, observations, akin, to, observations, in, other, branches, of, science, then, the, possibility, arises, that, they, may, contain, errors, but, it, is, difficult, to, make, sense, of, the, idea, that, subjects, could, be, wrong, about, their, own, experiences, and, even, more, difficult, to, see, how, such, an, error, could, be, detected, daniel, dennett, has, argued, for, an, approach, he, calls, heterophenomenology, which, means, treating, verbal, reports, as, stories, that, may, or, may, not, be, true, but, his, ideas, about, how, to, do, this, have, not, been, widely, adopted, another, issue, with, verbal, report, as, a, criterion, is, that, it, restricts, the, field, of, study, to, humans, who, have, language, this, approach, cannot, be, used, to, study, consciousness, in, other, species, pre, linguistic, children, or, people, with, types, of, brain, damage, that, impair, language, as, a, third, issue, philosophers, who, dispute, the, validity, of, the, turing, test, may, feel, that, it, is, possible, at, least, in, principle, for, verbal, report, to, be, dissociated, from, consciousness, entirely, a, philosophical, zombie, may, give, detailed, verbal, reports, of, awareness, in, the, absence, of, any, genuine, awareness, although, verbal, report, is, in, practice, the, gold, standard, for, ascribing, consciousness, it, is, not, the, only, possible, criterion, in, medicine, consciousness, is, assessed, as, a, combination, of, verbal, behavior, arousal, brain, activity, and, purposeful, movement, the, last, three, of, these, can, be, used, as, indicators, of, consciousness, when, verbal, behavior, is, absent, the, scientific, literature, regarding, the, neural, bases, of, arousal, and, purposeful, movement, is, very, extensive, their, reliability, as, indicators, of, consciousness, is, disputed, however, due, to, numerous, studies, showing, that, alert, human, subjects, can, be, induced, to, behave, purposefully, in, a, variety, of, ways, in, spite, of, reporting, a, complete, lack, of, awareness, studies, related, to, the, neuroscience, of, free, will, have, also, shown, that, the, influence, consciousness, has, on, decision, making, is, not, always, straight, forward, another, approach, applies, specifically, to, the, study, of, self, awareness, that, is, the, ability, to, distinguish, oneself, from, others, in, the, 1970s, gordon, gallup, developed, an, operational, test, for, self, awareness, known, as, the, mirror, test, the, test, examines, whether, animals, are, able, to, differentiate, between, seeing, themselves, in, a, mirror, versus, seeing, other, animals, the, classic, example, involves, placing, a, spot, of, coloring, on, the, skin, or, fur, near, the, individual, s, forehead, and, seeing, if, they, attempt, to, remove, it, or, at, least, touch, the, spot, thus, indicating, that, they, recognize, that, the, individual, they, are, seeing, in, the, mirror, is, themselves, humans, older, than, 18, months, and, other, great, apes, bottlenose, dolphins, orcas, pigeons, european, magpies, and, elephants, have, all, been, observed, to, pass, this, test, a, major, part, of, the, scientific, literature, on, consciousness, consists, of, studies, that, examine, the, relationship, between, the, experiences, reported, by, subjects, and, the, activity, that, simultaneously, takes, place, in, their, brains, that, is, studies, of, the, neural, correlates, of, consciousness, the, hope, is, to, find, that, activity, in, a, particular, part, of, the, brain, or, a, particular, pattern, of, global, brain, activity, which, will, be, strongly, predictive, of, conscious, awareness, several, brain, imaging, techniques, such, as, eeg, and, fmri, have, been, used, for, physical, measures, of, brain, activity, in, these, studies, another, idea, that, has, drawn, attention, for, several, decades, is, that, consciousness, is, associated, with, high, frequency, gamma, band, oscillations, in, brain, activity, this, idea, arose, from, proposals, in, the, 1980s, by, christof, von, der, malsburg, and, wolf, singer, that, gamma, oscillations, could, solve, the, so, called, binding, problem, by, linking, information, represented, in, different, parts, of, the, brain, into, a, unified, experience, rodolfo, llin, s, for, example, proposed, that, consciousness, results, from, recurrent, thalamo, cortical, resonance, where, the, specific, thalamocortical, systems, content, and, the, non, specific, centromedial, thalamus, thalamocortical, systems, context, interact, in, the, gamma, band, frequency, via, synchronous, oscillations, a, number, of, studies, have, shown, that, activity, in, primary, sensory, areas, of, the, brain, is, not, sufficient, to, produce, consciousness, it, is, possible, for, subjects, to, report, a, lack, of, awareness, even, when, areas, such, as, the, primary, visual, cortex, v1, show, clear, electrical, responses, to, a, stimulus, higher, brain, areas, are, seen, as, more, promising, especially, the, prefrontal, cortex, which, is, involved, in, a, range, of, higher, cognitive, functions, collectively, known, as, executive, functions, there, is, substantial, evidence, that, a, top, down, flow, of, neural, activity, i, e, activity, propagating, from, the, frontal, cortex, to, sensory, areas, is, more, predictive, of, conscious, awareness, than, a, bottom, up, flow, of, activity, the, prefrontal, cortex, is, not, the, only, candidate, area, however, studies, by, nikos, logothetis, and, his, colleagues, have, shown, for, example, that, visually, responsive, neurons, in, parts, of, the, temporal, lobe, reflect, the, visual, perception, in, the, situation, when, conflicting, visual, images, are, presented, to, different, eyes, i, e, bistable, percepts, during, binocular, rivalry, furthermore, top, down, feedback, from, higher, to, lower, visual, brain, areas, may, be, weaker, or, absent, in, the, peripheral, visual, field, as, suggested, by, some, experimental, data, and, theoretical, arguments, nevertheless, humans, can, perceive, visual, inputs, in, the, peripheral, visual, field, arising, from, bottom, up, v1, neural, activities, meanwhile, bottom, up, v1, activities, for, the, central, visual, fields, can, be, vetoed, and, thus, made, invisible, to, perception, by, the, top, down, feedback, when, these, bottom, up, signals, are, inconsistent, with, the, brain, s, internal, model, of, the, visual, world, modulation, of, neural, responses, may, correlate, with, phenomenal, experiences, in, contrast, to, the, raw, electrical, responses, that, do, not, correlate, with, consciousness, the, modulation, of, these, responses, by, other, stimuli, correlates, surprisingly, well, with, an, important, aspect, of, consciousness, namely, with, the, phenomenal, experience, of, stimulus, intensity, brightness, contrast, in, the, research, group, of, danko, nikoli, it, has, been, shown, that, some, of, the, changes, in, the, subjectively, perceived, brightness, correlated, with, the, modulation, of, firing, rates, while, others, correlated, with, the, modulation, of, neural, synchrony, an, fmri, investigation, suggested, that, these, findings, were, strictly, limited, to, the, primary, visual, areas, this, indicates, that, in, the, primary, visual, areas, changes, in, firing, rates, and, synchrony, can, be, considered, as, neural, correlates, of, qualia, at, least, for, some, type, of, qualia, in, 2013, the, perturbational, complexity, index, pci, was, proposed, a, measure, of, the, algorithmic, complexity, of, the, electrophysiological, response, of, the, cortex, to, transcranial, magnetic, stimulation, this, measure, was, shown, to, be, higher, in, individuals, that, are, awake, in, rem, sleep, or, in, a, locked, in, state, than, in, those, who, are, in, deep, sleep, or, in, a, vegetative, state, making, it, potentially, useful, as, a, quantitative, assessment, of, consciousness, states, assuming, that, not, only, humans, but, even, some, non, mammalian, species, are, conscious, a, number, of, evolutionary, approaches, to, the, problem, of, neural, correlates, of, consciousness, open, up, for, example, assuming, that, birds, are, conscious, a, common, assumption, among, neuroscientists, and, ethologists, due, to, the, extensive, cognitive, repertoire, of, birds, there, are, comparative, neuroanatomical, ways, to, validate, some, of, the, principal, currently, competing, mammalian, consciousness, brain, theories, the, rationale, for, such, a, comparative, study, is, that, the, avian, brain, deviates, structurally, from, the, mammalian, brain, so, how, similar, are, they, what, homologs, can, be, identified, the, general, conclusion, from, the, study, by, butler, et, al, is, that, some, of, the, major, theories, for, the, mammalian, brain, also, appear, to, be, valid, for, the, avian, brain, the, structures, assumed, to, be, critical, for, consciousness, in, mammalian, brains, have, homologous, counterparts, in, avian, brains, thus, the, main, portions, of, the, theories, of, crick, and, koch, edelman, and, tononi, and, cotterill, seem, to, be, compatible, with, the, assumption, that, birds, are, conscious, edelman, also, differentiates, between, what, he, calls, primary, consciousness, which, is, a, trait, shared, by, humans, and, non, human, animals, and, higher, order, consciousness, as, it, appears, in, humans, alone, along, with, human, language, capacity, certain, aspects, of, the, three, theories, however, seem, less, easy, to, apply, to, the, hypothesis, of, avian, consciousness, for, instance, the, suggestion, by, crick, and, koch, that, layer, 5, neurons, of, the, mammalian, brain, have, a, special, role, seems, difficult, to, apply, to, the, avian, brain, since, the, avian, homologs, have, a, different, morphology, likewise, the, theory, of, eccles, seems, incompatible, since, a, structural, homolog, analogue, to, the, dendron, has, not, been, found, in, avian, brains, the, assumption, of, an, avian, consciousness, also, brings, the, reptilian, brain, into, focus, the, reason, is, the, structural, continuity, between, avian, and, reptilian, brains, meaning, that, the, phylogenetic, origin, of, consciousness, may, be, earlier, than, suggested, by, many, leading, neuroscientists, joaquin, fuster, of, ucla, has, advocated, the, position, of, the, importance, of, the, prefrontal, cortex, in, humans, along, with, the, areas, of, wernicke, and, broca, as, being, of, particular, importance, to, the, development, of, human, language, capacities, neuro, anatomically, necessary, for, the, emergence, of, higher, order, consciousness, in, humans, a, study, in, 2016, looked, at, lesions, in, specific, areas, of, the, brainstem, that, were, associated, with, coma, and, vegetative, states, a, small, region, of, the, rostral, dorsolateral, pontine, tegmentum, in, the, brainstem, was, suggested, to, drive, consciousness, through, functional, connectivity, with, two, cortical, regions, the, left, ventral, anterior, insular, cortex, and, the, pregenual, anterior, cingulate, cortex, these, three, regions, may, work, together, as, a, triad, to, maintain, consciousness, a, wide, range, of, empirical, theories, of, consciousness, have, been, proposed, adrian, doerig, and, colleagues, list, 13, notable, theories, while, anil, seth, and, tim, bayne, list, 22, notable, theories, global, workspace, theory, gwt, is, a, cognitive, architecture, and, theory, of, consciousness, proposed, by, the, cognitive, psychologist, bernard, baars, in, 1988, baars, explains, the, theory, with, the, metaphor, of, a, theater, with, conscious, processes, represented, by, an, illuminated, stage, this, theater, integrates, inputs, from, a, variety, of, unconscious, and, otherwise, autonomous, networks, in, the, brain, and, then, broadcasts, them, to, unconscious, networks, represented, in, the, metaphor, by, a, broad, unlit, audience, the, theory, has, since, been, expanded, upon, by, other, scientists, including, cognitive, neuroscientist, stanislas, dehaene, and, lionel, naccache, integrated, information, theory, iit, postulates, that, consciousness, resides, in, the, information, being, processed, and, arises, once, the, information, reaches, a, certain, level, of, complexity, additionally, iit, is, one, of, the, only, leading, theories, of, consciousness, that, attempts, to, create, a, 1, 1, mapping, between, conscious, states, and, precise, formal, mathematical, descriptions, of, those, mental, states, proponents, of, this, model, suggest, that, it, may, provide, a, physical, grounding, for, consciousness, in, neurons, as, they, provide, the, mechanism, by, which, information, is, integrated, orchestrated, objective, reduction, orch, or, postulates, that, consciousness, originates, at, the, quantum, level, inside, neurons, the, mechanism, is, held, to, be, a, quantum, process, called, objective, reduction, that, is, orchestrated, by, cellular, structures, called, microtubules, however, the, details, of, the, mechanism, would, go, beyond, current, quantum, theory, in, 2011, graziano, and, kastner, proposed, the, attention, schema, theory, of, awareness, in, that, theory, specific, cortical, areas, notably, in, the, superior, temporal, sulcus, and, the, temporo, parietal, junction, are, used, to, build, the, construct, of, awareness, and, attribute, it, to, other, people, the, same, cortical, machinery, is, also, used, to, attribute, awareness, to, oneself, damage, to, these, cortical, regions, can, lead, to, deficits, in, consciousness, such, as, hemispatial, neglect, in, the, attention, schema, theory, the, value, of, explaining, the, feature, of, awareness, and, attributing, it, to, a, person, is, to, gain, a, useful, predictive, model, of, that, person, s, attentional, processing, attention, is, a, style, of, information, processing, in, which, a, brain, focuses, its, resources, on, a, limited, set, of, interrelated, signals, awareness, in, this, theory, is, a, useful, simplified, schema, that, represents, attentional, states, to, be, aware, of, x, is, explained, by, constructing, a, model, of, one, s, attentional, focus, on, x, the, entropic, brain, is, a, theory, of, conscious, states, informed, by, neuroimaging, research, with, psychedelic, drugs, the, theory, suggests, that, the, brain, in, primary, states, such, as, rapid, eye, movement, rem, sleep, early, psychosis, and, under, the, influence, of, psychedelic, drugs, is, in, a, disordered, state, normal, waking, consciousness, constrains, some, of, this, freedom, and, makes, possible, metacognitive, functions, such, as, internal, self, administered, reality, testing, and, self, awareness, criticism, has, included, questioning, whether, the, theory, has, been, adequately, tested, in, 2017, work, by, david, rudrauf, and, colleagues, including, karl, friston, applied, the, active, inference, paradigm, to, consciousness, a, model, of, how, sensory, data, is, integrated, with, priors, in, a, process, of, projective, transformation, the, authors, argue, that, while, their, model, identifies, a, key, relationship, between, computation, and, phenomenology, it, does, not, completely, solve, the, hard, problem, of, consciousness, or, completely, close, the, explanatory, gap, the, emergence, of, consciousness, during, biological, evolution, remains, a, topic, of, ongoing, scientific, inquiry, the, survival, value, of, consciousness, is, still, a, matter, of, exploration, and, understanding, while, consciousness, appears, to, play, a, crucial, role, in, human, cognition, decision, making, and, self, awareness, its, adaptive, significance, across, different, species, remains, a, subject, of, debate, some, people, question, whether, consciousness, has, any, survival, value, some, argue, that, consciousness, is, a, by, product, of, evolution, thomas, henry, huxley, for, example, defends, in, an, essay, titled, on, the, hypothesis, that, animals, are, automata, and, its, history, an, epiphenomenalist, theory, of, consciousness, according, to, which, consciousness, is, a, causally, inert, effect, of, neural, activity, as, the, steam, whistle, which, accompanies, the, work, of, a, locomotive, engine, is, without, influence, upon, its, machinery, to, this, william, james, objects, in, his, essay, are, we, automata, by, stating, an, evolutionary, argument, for, mind, brain, interaction, implying, that, if, the, preservation, and, development, of, consciousness, in, the, biological, evolution, is, a, result, of, natural, selection, it, is, plausible, that, consciousness, has, not, only, been, influenced, by, neural, processes, but, has, had, a, survival, value, itself, and, it, could, only, have, had, this, if, it, had, been, efficacious, karl, popper, develops, a, similar, evolutionary, argument, in, the, book, the, self, and, its, brain, opinions, are, divided, on, when, and, how, consciousness, first, arose, it, has, been, argued, that, consciousness, emerged, i, exclusively, with, the, first, humans, ii, exclusively, with, the, first, mammals, iii, independently, in, mammals, and, birds, or, iv, with, the, first, reptiles, other, authors, date, the, origins, of, consciousness, to, the, first, animals, with, nervous, systems, or, early, vertebrates, in, the, cambrian, over, 500, million, years, ago, donald, griffin, suggests, in, his, book, animal, minds, a, gradual, evolution, of, consciousness, regarding, the, primary, function, of, conscious, processing, a, recurring, idea, in, recent, theories, is, that, phenomenal, states, somehow, integrate, neural, activities, and, information, processing, that, would, otherwise, be, independent, this, has, been, called, the, integration, consensus, another, example, has, been, proposed, by, gerald, edelman, called, dynamic, core, hypothesis, which, puts, emphasis, on, reentrant, connections, that, reciprocally, link, areas, of, the, brain, in, a, massively, parallel, manner, edelman, also, stresses, the, importance, of, the, evolutionary, emergence, of, higher, order, consciousness, in, humans, from, the, historically, older, trait, of, primary, consciousness, which, humans, share, with, non, human, animals, see, neural, correlates, section, above, these, theories, of, integrative, function, present, solutions, to, two, classic, problems, associated, with, consciousness, differentiation, and, unity, they, show, how, our, conscious, experience, can, discriminate, between, a, virtually, unlimited, number, of, different, possible, scenes, and, details, differentiation, because, it, integrates, those, details, from, our, sensory, systems, while, the, integrative, nature, of, consciousness, in, this, view, easily, explains, how, our, experience, can, seem, unified, as, one, whole, despite, all, of, these, individual, parts, however, it, remains, unspecified, which, kinds, of, information, are, integrated, in, a, conscious, manner, and, which, kinds, can, be, integrated, without, consciousness, nor, is, it, explained, what, specific, causal, role, conscious, integration, plays, nor, why, the, same, functionality, cannot, be, achieved, without, consciousness, obviously, not, all, kinds, of, information, are, capable, of, being, disseminated, consciously, e, g, neural, activity, related, to, vegetative, functions, reflexes, unconscious, motor, programs, low, level, perceptual, analyzes, etc, and, many, kinds, of, information, can, be, disseminated, and, combined, with, other, kinds, without, consciousness, as, in, intersensory, interactions, such, as, the, ventriloquism, effect, hence, it, remains, unclear, why, any, of, it, is, conscious, for, a, review, of, the, differences, between, conscious, and, unconscious, integrations, see, the, article, of, ezequiel, morsella, as, noted, earlier, even, among, writers, who, consider, consciousness, to, be, well, defined, there, is, widespread, dispute, about, which, animals, other, than, humans, can, be, said, to, possess, it, edelman, has, described, this, distinction, as, that, of, humans, possessing, higher, order, consciousness, while, sharing, the, trait, of, primary, consciousness, with, non, human, animals, see, previous, paragraph, thus, any, examination, of, the, evolution, of, consciousness, is, faced, with, great, difficulties, nevertheless, some, writers, have, argued, that, consciousness, can, be, viewed, from, the, standpoint, of, evolutionary, biology, as, an, adaptation, in, the, sense, of, a, trait, that, increases, fitness, in, his, article, evolution, of, consciousness, john, eccles, argued, that, special, anatomical, and, physical, properties, of, the, mammalian, cerebral, cortex, gave, rise, to, consciousness, psychon, linked, to, dendron, through, quantum, physics, bernard, baars, proposed, that, once, in, place, this, recursive, circuitry, may, have, provided, a, basis, for, the, subsequent, development, of, many, of, the, functions, that, consciousness, facilitates, in, higher, organisms, peter, carruthers, has, put, forth, one, such, potential, adaptive, advantage, gained, by, conscious, creatures, by, suggesting, that, consciousness, allows, an, individual, to, make, distinctions, between, appearance, and, reality, this, ability, would, enable, a, creature, to, recognize, the, likelihood, that, their, perceptions, are, deceiving, them, e, g, that, water, in, the, distance, may, be, a, mirage, and, behave, accordingly, and, it, could, also, facilitate, the, manipulation, of, others, by, recognizing, how, things, appear, to, them, for, both, cooperative, and, devious, ends, other, philosophers, however, have, suggested, that, consciousness, would, not, be, necessary, for, any, functional, advantage, in, evolutionary, processes, no, one, has, given, a, causal, explanation, they, argue, of, why, it, would, not, be, possible, for, a, functionally, equivalent, non, conscious, organism, i, e, a, philosophical, zombie, to, achieve, the, very, same, survival, advantages, as, a, conscious, organism, if, evolutionary, processes, are, blind, to, the, difference, between, function, f, being, performed, by, conscious, organism, o, and, non, conscious, organism, o, it, is, unclear, what, adaptive, advantage, consciousness, could, provide, as, a, result, an, exaptive, explanation, of, consciousness, has, gained, favor, with, some, theorists, that, posit, consciousness, did, not, evolve, as, an, adaptation, but, was, an, exaptation, arising, as, a, consequence, of, other, developments, such, as, increases, in, brain, size, or, cortical, rearrangement, consciousness, in, this, sense, has, been, compared, to, the, blind, spot, in, the, retina, where, it, is, not, an, adaption, of, the, retina, but, instead, just, a, by, product, of, the, way, the, retinal, axons, were, wired, several, scholars, including, pinker, chomsky, edelman, and, luria, have, indicated, the, importance, of, the, emergence, of, human, language, as, an, important, regulative, mechanism, of, learning, and, memory, in, the, context, of, the, development, of, higher, order, consciousness, see, neural, correlates, section, above, there, are, some, brain, states, in, which, consciousness, seems, to, be, absent, including, dreamless, sleep, or, coma, there, are, also, a, variety, of, circumstances, that, can, change, the, relationship, between, the, mind, and, the, world, in, less, drastic, ways, producing, what, are, known, as, altered, states, of, consciousness, some, altered, states, occur, naturally, others, can, be, produced, by, drugs, or, brain, damage, altered, states, can, be, accompanied, by, changes, in, thinking, disturbances, in, the, sense, of, time, feelings, of, loss, of, control, changes, in, emotional, expression, alternations, in, body, image, and, changes, in, meaning, or, significance, the, two, most, widely, accepted, altered, states, are, sleep, and, dreaming, although, dream, sleep, and, non, dream, sleep, appear, very, similar, to, an, outside, observer, each, is, associated, with, a, distinct, pattern, of, brain, activity, metabolic, activity, and, eye, movement, each, is, also, associated, with, a, distinct, pattern, of, experience, and, cognition, during, ordinary, non, dream, sleep, people, who, are, awakened, report, only, vague, and, sketchy, thoughts, and, their, experiences, do, not, cohere, into, a, continuous, narrative, during, dream, sleep, in, contrast, people, who, are, awakened, report, rich, and, detailed, experiences, in, which, events, form, a, continuous, progression, which, may, however, be, interrupted, by, bizarre, or, fantastic, intrusions, thought, processes, during, the, dream, state, frequently, show, a, high, level, of, irrationality, both, dream, and, non, dream, states, are, associated, with, severe, disruption, of, memory, it, usually, disappears, in, seconds, during, the, non, dream, state, and, in, minutes, after, awakening, from, a, dream, unless, actively, refreshed, research, conducted, on, the, effects, of, partial, epileptic, seizures, on, consciousness, found, that, patients, who, have, partial, epileptic, seizures, experience, altered, states, of, consciousness, in, partial, epileptic, seizures, consciousness, is, impaired, or, lost, while, some, aspects, of, consciousness, often, automated, behaviors, remain, intact, studies, found, that, when, measuring, the, qualitative, features, during, partial, epileptic, seizures, patients, exhibited, an, increase, in, arousal, and, became, absorbed, in, the, experience, of, the, seizure, followed, by, difficulty, in, focusing, and, shifting, attention, a, variety, of, psychoactive, drugs, including, alcohol, have, notable, effects, on, consciousness, these, range, from, a, simple, dulling, of, awareness, produced, by, sedatives, to, increases, in, the, intensity, of, sensory, qualities, produced, by, stimulants, cannabis, empathogens, entactogens, such, as, mdma, ecstasy, or, most, notably, by, the, class, of, drugs, known, as, psychedelics, lsd, mescaline, psilocybin, dimethyltryptamine, and, others, in, this, group, can, produce, major, distortions, of, perception, including, hallucinations, some, users, even, describe, their, drug, induced, experiences, as, mystical, or, spiritual, in, quality, the, brain, mechanisms, underlying, these, effects, are, not, as, well, understood, as, those, induced, by, use, of, alcohol, but, there, is, substantial, evidence, that, alterations, in, the, brain, system, that, uses, the, chemical, neurotransmitter, serotonin, play, an, essential, role, there, has, been, some, research, into, physiological, changes, in, yogis, and, people, who, practise, various, techniques, of, meditation, some, research, with, brain, waves, during, meditation, has, reported, differences, between, those, corresponding, to, ordinary, relaxation, and, those, corresponding, to, meditation, it, has, been, disputed, however, whether, there, is, enough, evidence, to, count, these, as, physiologically, distinct, states, of, consciousness, the, most, extensive, study, of, the, characteristics, of, altered, states, of, consciousness, was, made, by, psychologist, charles, tart, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, tart, analyzed, a, state, of, consciousness, as, made, up, of, a, number, of, component, processes, including, exteroception, sensing, the, external, world, interoception, sensing, the, body, input, processing, seeing, meaning, emotions, memory, time, sense, sense, of, identity, evaluation, and, cognitive, processing, motor, output, and, interaction, with, the, environment, each, of, these, in, his, view, could, be, altered, in, multiple, ways, by, drugs, or, other, manipulations, the, components, that, tart, identified, have, not, however, been, validated, by, empirical, studies, research, in, this, area, has, not, yet, reached, firm, conclusions, but, a, recent, questionnaire, based, study, identified, eleven, significant, factors, contributing, to, drug, induced, states, of, consciousness, experience, of, unity, spiritual, experience, blissful, state, insightfulness, disembodiment, impaired, control, and, cognition, anxiety, complex, imagery, elementary, imagery, audio, visual, synesthesia, and, changed, meaning, of, percepts, the, medical, approach, to, consciousness, is, scientifically, oriented, it, derives, from, a, need, to, treat, people, whose, brain, function, has, been, impaired, as, a, result, of, disease, brain, damage, toxins, or, drugs, in, medicine, conceptual, distinctions, are, considered, useful, to, the, degree, that, they, can, help, to, guide, treatments, the, medical, approach, focuses, mostly, on, the, amount, of, consciousness, a, person, has, in, medicine, consciousness, is, assessed, as, a, level, ranging, from, coma, and, brain, death, at, the, low, end, to, full, alertness, and, purposeful, responsiveness, at, the, high, end, consciousness, is, of, concern, to, patients, and, physicians, especially, neurologists, and, anesthesiologists, patients, may, have, disorders, of, consciousness, or, may, need, to, be, anesthetized, for, a, surgical, procedure, physicians, may, perform, consciousness, related, interventions, such, as, instructing, the, patient, to, sleep, administering, general, anesthesia, or, inducing, medical, coma, also, bioethicists, may, be, concerned, with, the, ethical, implications, of, consciousness, in, medical, cases, of, patients, such, as, the, karen, ann, quinlan, case, while, neuroscientists, may, study, patients, with, impaired, consciousness, in, hopes, of, gaining, information, about, how, the, brain, works, in, medicine, consciousness, is, examined, using, a, set, of, procedures, known, as, neuropsychological, assessment, there, are, two, commonly, used, methods, for, assessing, the, level, of, consciousness, of, a, patient, a, simple, procedure, that, requires, minimal, training, and, a, more, complex, procedure, that, requires, substantial, expertise, the, simple, procedure, begins, by, asking, whether, the, patient, is, able, to, move, and, react, to, physical, stimuli, if, so, the, next, question, is, whether, the, patient, can, respond, in, a, meaningful, way, to, questions, and, commands, if, so, the, patient, is, asked, for, name, current, location, and, current, day, and, time, a, patient, who, can, answer, all, of, these, questions, is, said, to, be, alert, and, oriented, times, four, sometimes, denoted, a, ox4, on, a, medical, chart, and, is, usually, considered, fully, conscious, the, more, complex, procedure, is, known, as, a, neurological, examination, and, is, usually, carried, out, by, a, neurologist, in, a, hospital, setting, a, formal, neurological, examination, runs, through, a, precisely, delineated, series, of, tests, beginning, with, tests, for, basic, sensorimotor, reflexes, and, culminating, with, tests, for, sophisticated, use, of, language, the, outcome, may, be, summarized, using, the, glasgow, coma, scale, which, yields, a, number, in, the, range, 3, 15, with, a, score, of, 3, to, 8, indicating, coma, and, 15, indicating, full, consciousness, the, glasgow, coma, scale, has, three, subscales, measuring, the, best, motor, response, ranging, from, no, motor, response, to, obeys, commands, the, best, eye, response, ranging, from, no, eye, opening, to, eyes, opening, spontaneously, and, the, best, verbal, response, ranging, from, no, verbal, response, to, fully, oriented, there, is, also, a, simpler, pediatric, version, of, the, scale, for, children, too, young, to, be, able, to, use, language, in, 2013, an, experimental, procedure, was, developed, to, measure, degrees, of, consciousness, the, procedure, involving, stimulating, the, brain, with, a, magnetic, pulse, measuring, resulting, waves, of, electrical, activity, and, developing, a, consciousness, score, based, on, the, complexity, of, the, brain, activity, medical, conditions, that, inhibit, consciousness, are, considered, disorders, of, consciousness, this, category, generally, includes, minimally, conscious, state, and, persistent, vegetative, state, but, sometimes, also, includes, the, less, severe, locked, in, syndrome, and, more, severe, chronic, coma, differential, diagnosis, of, these, disorders, is, an, active, area, of, biomedical, research, finally, brain, death, results, in, possible, irreversible, disruption, of, consciousness, while, other, conditions, may, cause, a, moderate, deterioration, e, g, dementia, and, delirium, or, transient, interruption, e, g, grand, mal, and, petit, mal, seizures, of, consciousness, they, are, not, included, in, this, category, medical, experts, increasingly, view, anosognosia, as, a, disorder, of, consciousness, anosognosia, is, a, greek, derived, term, meaning, unawareness, of, disease, this, is, a, condition, in, which, patients, are, disabled, in, some, way, most, commonly, as, a, result, of, a, stroke, but, either, misunderstand, the, nature, of, the, problem, or, deny, that, there, is, anything, wrong, with, them, the, most, frequently, occurring, form, is, seen, in, people, who, have, experienced, a, stroke, damaging, the, parietal, lobe, in, the, right, hemisphere, of, the, brain, giving, rise, to, a, syndrome, known, as, hemispatial, neglect, characterized, by, an, inability, to, direct, action, or, attention, toward, objects, located, to, the, left, with, respect, to, their, bodies, patients, with, hemispatial, neglect, are, often, paralyzed, on, the, left, side, of, the, body, but, sometimes, deny, being, unable, to, move, when, questioned, about, the, obvious, problem, the, patient, may, avoid, giving, a, direct, answer, or, may, give, an, explanation, that, does, not, make, sense, patients, with, hemispatial, neglect, may, also, fail, to, recognize, paralyzed, parts, of, their, bodies, one, frequently, mentioned, case, is, of, a, man, who, repeatedly, tried, to, throw, his, own, paralyzed, right, leg, out, of, the, bed, he, was, lying, in, and, when, asked, what, he, was, doing, complained, that, somebody, had, put, a, dead, leg, into, the, bed, with, him, an, even, more, striking, type, of, anosognosia, is, anton, babinski, syndrome, a, rarely, occurring, condition, in, which, patients, become, blind, but, claim, to, be, able, to, see, normally, and, persist, in, this, claim, in, spite, of, all, evidence, to, the, contrary, of, the, eight, types, of, consciousness, in, the, lycan, classification, some, are, detectable, in, utero, and, others, develop, years, after, birth, psychologist, and, educator, william, foulkes, studied, children, s, dreams, and, concluded, that, prior, to, the, shift, in, cognitive, maturation, that, humans, experience, during, ages, five, to, seven, children, lack, the, lockean, consciousness, that, lycan, had, labeled, introspective, consciousness, and, that, foulkes, labels, self, reflection, in, a, 2020, paper, katherine, nelson, and, robyn, fivush, use, autobiographical, consciousness, to, label, essentially, the, same, faculty, and, agree, with, foulkes, on, the, timing, of, this, faculty, s, acquisition, nelson, and, fivush, contend, that, language, is, the, tool, by, which, humans, create, a, new, uniquely, human, form, of, consciousness, namely, autobiographical, consciousness, julian, jaynes, had, staked, out, these, positions, decades, earlier, citing, the, developmental, steps, that, lead, the, infant, to, autobiographical, consciousness, nelson, and, fivush, point, to, the, acquisition, of, theory, of, mind, calling, theory, of, mind, necessary, for, autobiographical, consciousness, and, defining, it, as, understanding, differences, between, one, s, own, mind, and, others, minds, in, terms, of, beliefs, desires, emotions, and, thoughts, they, write, the, hallmark, of, theory, of, mind, the, understanding, of, false, belief, occurs, at, five, to, six, years, of, age, the, topic, of, animal, consciousness, is, beset, by, a, number, of, difficulties, it, poses, the, problem, of, other, minds, in, an, especially, severe, form, because, non, human, animals, lacking, the, ability, to, express, human, language, cannot, tell, humans, about, their, experiences, also, it, is, difficult, to, reason, objectively, about, the, question, because, a, denial, that, an, animal, is, conscious, is, often, taken, to, imply, that, it, does, not, feel, its, life, has, no, value, and, that, harming, it, is, not, morally, wrong, descartes, for, example, has, sometimes, been, blamed, for, mistreatment, of, animals, due, to, the, fact, that, he, believed, only, humans, have, a, non, physical, mind, most, people, have, a, strong, intuition, that, some, animals, such, as, cats, and, dogs, are, conscious, while, others, such, as, insects, are, not, but, the, sources, of, this, intuition, are, not, obvious, and, are, often, based, on, personal, interactions, with, pets, and, other, animals, they, have, observed, philosophers, who, consider, subjective, experience, the, essence, of, consciousness, also, generally, believe, as, a, correlate, that, the, existence, and, nature, of, animal, consciousness, can, never, rigorously, be, known, thomas, nagel, spelled, out, this, point, of, view, in, an, influential, essay, titled, what, is, it, like, to, be, a, bat, he, said, that, an, organism, is, conscious, if, and, only, if, there, is, something, that, it, is, like, to, be, that, organism, something, it, is, like, for, the, organism, and, he, argued, that, no, matter, how, much, we, know, about, an, animal, s, brain, and, behavior, we, can, never, really, put, ourselves, into, the, mind, of, the, animal, and, experience, its, world, in, the, way, it, does, itself, other, thinkers, such, as, douglas, hofstadter, dismiss, this, argument, as, incoherent, several, psychologists, and, ethologists, have, argued, for, the, existence, of, animal, consciousness, by, describing, a, range, of, behaviors, that, appear, to, show, animals, holding, beliefs, about, things, they, cannot, directly, perceive, donald, griffin, s, 2001, book, animal, minds, reviews, a, substantial, portion, of, the, evidence, on, july, 7, 2012, eminent, scientists, from, different, branches, of, neuroscience, gathered, at, the, university, of, cambridge, to, celebrate, the, francis, crick, memorial, conference, which, deals, with, consciousness, in, humans, and, pre, linguistic, consciousness, in, nonhuman, animals, after, the, conference, they, signed, in, the, presence, of, stephen, hawking, the, cambridge, declaration, on, consciousness, which, summarizes, the, most, important, findings, of, the, survey, we, decided, to, reach, a, consensus, and, make, a, statement, directed, to, the, public, that, is, not, scientific, it, s, obvious, to, everyone, in, this, room, that, animals, have, consciousness, but, it, is, not, obvious, to, the, rest, of, the, world, it, is, not, obvious, to, the, rest, of, the, western, world, or, the, far, east, it, is, not, obvious, to, the, society, convergent, evidence, indicates, that, non, human, animals, including, all, mammals, and, birds, and, other, creatures, have, the, necessary, neural, substrates, of, consciousness, and, the, capacity, to, exhibit, intentional, behaviors, the, idea, of, an, artifact, made, conscious, is, an, ancient, theme, of, mythology, appearing, for, example, in, the, greek, myth, of, pygmalion, who, carved, a, statue, that, was, magically, brought, to, life, and, in, medieval, jewish, stories, of, the, golem, a, magically, animated, homunculus, built, of, clay, however, the, possibility, of, actually, constructing, a, conscious, machine, was, probably, first, discussed, by, ada, lovelace, in, a, set, of, notes, written, in, 1842, about, the, analytical, engine, invented, by, charles, babbage, a, precursor, never, built, to, modern, electronic, computers, lovelace, was, essentially, dismissive, of, the, idea, that, a, machine, such, as, the, analytical, engine, could, think, in, a, humanlike, way, she, wrote, it, is, desirable, to, guard, against, the, possibility, of, exaggerated, ideas, that, might, arise, as, to, the, powers, of, the, analytical, engine, the, analytical, engine, has, no, pretensions, whatever, to, originate, anything, it, can, do, whatever, we, know, how, to, order, it, to, perform, it, can, follow, analysis, but, it, has, no, power, of, anticipating, any, analytical, relations, or, truths, its, province, is, to, assist, us, in, making, available, what, we, are, already, acquainted, with, one, of, the, most, influential, contributions, to, this, question, was, an, essay, written, in, 1950, by, pioneering, computer, scientist, alan, turing, titled, computing, machinery, and, intelligence, turing, disavowed, any, interest, in, terminology, saying, that, even, can, machines, think, is, too, loaded, with, spurious, connotations, to, be, meaningful, but, he, proposed, to, replace, all, such, questions, with, a, specific, operational, test, which, has, become, known, as, the, turing, test, to, pass, the, test, a, computer, must, be, able, to, imitate, a, human, well, enough, to, fool, interrogators, in, his, essay, turing, discussed, a, variety, of, possible, objections, and, presented, a, counterargument, to, each, of, them, the, turing, test, is, commonly, cited, in, discussions, of, artificial, intelligence, as, a, proposed, criterion, for, machine, consciousness, it, has, provoked, a, great, deal, of, philosophical, debate, for, example, daniel, dennett, and, douglas, hofstadter, argue, that, anything, capable, of, passing, the, turing, test, is, necessarily, conscious, while, david, chalmers, argues, that, a, philosophical, zombie, could, pass, the, test, yet, fail, to, be, conscious, a, third, group, of, scholars, have, argued, that, with, technological, growth, once, machines, begin, to, display, any, substantial, signs, of, human, like, behavior, then, the, dichotomy, of, human, consciousness, compared, to, human, like, consciousness, becomes, pass, and, issues, of, machine, autonomy, begin, to, prevail, even, as, observed, in, its, nascent, form, within, contemporary, industry, and, technology, j, rgen, schmidhuber, argues, that, consciousness, is, the, result, of, compression, as, an, agent, sees, representation, of, itself, recurring, in, the, environment, the, compression, of, this, representation, can, be, called, consciousness, in, a, lively, exchange, over, what, has, come, to, be, referred, to, as, the, chinese, room, argument, john, searle, sought, to, refute, the, claim, of, proponents, of, what, he, calls, strong, artificial, intelligence, ai, that, a, computer, program, can, be, conscious, though, he, does, agree, with, advocates, of, weak, ai, that, computer, programs, can, be, formatted, to, simulate, conscious, states, his, own, view, is, that, consciousness, has, subjective, first, person, causal, powers, by, being, essentially, intentional, due, to, the, way, human, brains, function, biologically, conscious, persons, can, perform, computations, but, consciousness, is, not, inherently, computational, the, way, computer, programs, are, to, make, a, turing, machine, that, speaks, chinese, searle, imagines, a, room, with, one, monolingual, english, speaker, searle, himself, in, fact, a, book, that, designates, a, combination, of, chinese, symbols, to, be, output, paired, with, chinese, symbol, input, and, boxes, filled, with, chinese, symbols, in, this, case, the, english, speaker, is, acting, as, a, computer, and, the, rulebook, as, a, program, searle, argues, that, with, such, a, machine, he, would, be, able, to, process, the, inputs, to, outputs, perfectly, without, having, any, understanding, of, chinese, nor, having, any, idea, what, the, questions, and, answers, could, possibly, mean, if, the, experiment, were, done, in, english, since, searle, knows, english, he, would, be, able, to, take, questions, and, give, answers, without, any, algorithms, for, english, questions, and, he, would, be, effectively, aware, of, what, was, being, said, and, the, purposes, it, might, serve, searle, would, pass, the, turing, test, of, answering, the, questions, in, both, languages, but, he, is, only, conscious, of, what, he, is, doing, when, he, speaks, english, another, way, of, putting, the, argument, is, to, say, that, computer, programs, can, pass, the, turing, test, for, processing, the, syntax, of, a, language, but, that, the, syntax, cannot, lead, to, semantic, meaning, in, the, way, strong, ai, advocates, hoped, in, the, literature, concerning, artificial, intelligence, searle, s, essay, has, been, second, only, to, turing, s, in, the, volume, of, debate, it, has, generated, searle, himself, was, vague, about, what, extra, ingredients, it, would, take, to, make, a, machine, conscious, all, he, proposed, was, that, what, was, needed, was, causal, powers, of, the, sort, that, the, brain, has, and, that, computers, lack, but, other, thinkers, sympathetic, to, his, basic, argument, have, suggested, that, the, necessary, though, perhaps, still, not, sufficient, extra, conditions, may, include, the, ability, to, pass, not, just, the, verbal, version, of, the, turing, test, but, the, robotic, version, which, requires, grounding, the, robot, s, words, in, the, robot, s, sensorimotor, capacity, to, categorize, and, interact, with, the, things, in, the, world, that, its, words, are, about, turing, indistinguishably, from, a, real, person, turing, scale, robotics, is, an, empirical, branch, of, research, on, embodied, cognition, and, situated, cognition, in, 2014, victor, argonov, has, suggested, a, non, turing, test, for, machine, consciousness, based, on, a, machine, s, ability, to, produce, philosophical, judgments, he, argues, that, a, deterministic, machine, must, be, regarded, as, conscious, if, it, is, able, to, produce, judgments, on, all, problematic, properties, of, consciousness, such, as, qualia, or, binding, having, no, innate, preloaded, philosophical, knowledge, on, these, issues, no, philosophical, discussions, while, learning, and, no, informational, models, of, other, creatures, in, its, memory, such, models, may, implicitly, or, explicitly, contain, knowledge, about, these, creatures, consciousness, however, this, test, can, be, used, only, to, detect, but, not, refute, the, existence, of, consciousness, a, positive, result, proves, that, a, machine, is, conscious, but, a, negative, result, proves, nothing, for, example, absence, of, philosophical, judgments, may, be, caused, by, lack, of, the, machine, s, intellect, not, by, absence, of, consciousness, william, james, is, usually, credited, with, popularizing, the, idea, that, human, consciousness, flows, like, a, stream, in, his, principles, of, psychology, of, 1890, according, to, james, the, stream, of, thought, is, governed, by, five, characteristics, a, similar, concept, appears, in, buddhist, philosophy, expressed, by, the, sanskrit, term, citta, sa, t, na, which, is, usually, translated, as, mindstream, or, mental, continuum, buddhist, teachings, describe, that, consciousness, manifests, moment, to, moment, as, sense, impressions, and, mental, phenomena, that, are, continuously, changing, the, teachings, list, six, triggers, that, can, result, in, the, generation, of, different, mental, events, these, triggers, are, input, from, the, five, senses, seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, or, touch, sensations, or, a, thought, relating, to, the, past, present, or, the, future, that, happen, to, arise, in, the, mind, the, mental, events, generated, as, a, result, of, these, triggers, are, feelings, perceptions, and, intentions, behaviour, the, moment, by, moment, manifestation, of, the, mind, stream, is, said, to, happen, in, every, person, all, the, time, it, even, happens, in, a, scientist, who, analyzes, various, phenomena, in, the, world, or, analyzes, the, material, body, including, the, organ, brain, the, manifestation, of, the, mindstream, is, also, described, as, being, influenced, by, physical, laws, biological, laws, psychological, laws, volitional, laws, and, universal, laws, the, purpose, of, the, buddhist, practice, of, mindfulness, is, to, understand, the, inherent, nature, of, the, consciousness, and, its, characteristics, in, the, west, the, primary, impact, of, the, idea, has, been, on, literature, rather, than, science, stream, of, consciousness, as, a, narrative, mode, means, writing, in, a, way, that, attempts, to, portray, the, moment, to, moment, thoughts, and, experiences, of, a, character, this, technique, perhaps, had, its, beginnings, in, the, monologues, of, shakespeare, s, plays, and, reached, its, fullest, development, in, the, novels, of, james, joyce, and, virginia, woolf, although, it, has, also, been, used, by, many, other,
