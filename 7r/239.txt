berbers, or, the, berber, peoples, also, called, by, their, endonym, amazigh, or, imazighen, are, a, diverse, grouping, of, distinct, ethnic, groups, indigenous, to, north, africa, who, predate, the, arrival, of, arabs, in, the, arab, migrations, to, the, maghreb, their, main, connections, are, identified, by, their, usage, of, berber, languages, most, of, them, mutually, unintelligible, which, are, part, of, the, afroasiatic, language, family, they, are, indigenous, to, the, maghreb, region, of, north, africa, where, they, live, in, scattered, communities, across, parts, of, morocco, algeria, libya, and, to, a, lesser, extent, tunisia, mauritania, northern, mali, and, northern, niger, smaller, berber, communities, are, also, found, in, burkina, faso, and, egypt, s, siwa, oasis, descended, from, stone, age, tribes, of, north, africa, accounts, of, the, imazighen, were, first, mentioned, in, ancient, egyptian, writings, from, about, 2000, bce, berber, languages, spread, westward, from, the, nile, valley, across, the, northern, sahara, into, the, maghreb, a, series, of, berber, peoples, such, as, the, mauri, masaesyli, massyli, musulamii, gaetuli, and, garamantes, gave, rise, to, berber, kingdoms, such, as, numidia, and, mauretania, other, kingdoms, appeared, in, late, antiquity, such, as, altava, aur, s, ouarsenis, and, hodna, berber, kingdoms, were, eventually, suppressed, by, the, arab, conquests, of, the, 7th, and, 8th, centuries, ce, this, started, a, process, of, cultural, and, linguistic, assimilation, known, as, arabization, which, influenced, the, berber, population, arabization, involved, the, spread, of, arabic, language, and, arab, culture, among, the, berbers, leading, to, the, adoption, of, arabic, as, the, primary, language, and, conversion, to, islam, notably, the, arab, migrations, to, the, maghreb, from, the, 7th, century, to, the, 17th, century, accelerated, this, process, while, local, arab, dynasties, came, to, rule, parts, of, the, maghreb, after, the, 7th, century, berber, tribes, remained, powerful, political, forces, and, founded, new, ruling, dynasties, in, the, 10th, and, 11th, centuries, such, as, the, zirids, hammadids, various, zenata, principalities, in, the, western, maghreb, and, several, taifa, kingdoms, in, al, andalus, islam, later, provided, the, ideological, stimulus, for, the, rise, of, fresh, berber, empires, the, almoravids, and, almohads, in, the, 11th, to, 13th, centuries, their, berber, successors, the, marinids, the, zayyanids, and, the, hafsids, continued, to, rule, until, the, 16th, century, from, the, 16th, century, onward, the, process, continued, in, the, absence, of, berber, dynasties, in, morocco, they, were, replaced, by, arabs, claiming, descent, from, the, islamic, prophet, muhammad, berbers, are, divided, into, several, diverse, ethnic, groups, and, berber, languages, such, as, kabyles, chaouis, and, rifians, historically, berbers, across, the, region, did, not, see, themselves, as, a, single, cultural, or, linguistic, unit, nor, was, there, a, greater, berber, community, due, to, their, differing, cultures, they, also, did, not, refer, to, themselves, as, berbers, amazigh, but, had, their, own, terms, to, refer, to, their, own, groups, and, communities, they, started, being, referred, to, collectively, as, berbers, after, the, arab, conquests, of, the, 7th, century, and, this, distinction, was, revived, by, french, colonial, administrators, in, the, 19th, century, today, the, term, berber, is, viewed, as, pejorative, by, many, who, prefer, the, term, amazigh, since, the, late, 20th, century, a, trans, national, movement, known, as, berberism, or, the, berber, culture, movement, has, emerged, among, various, parts, of, the, berber, populations, of, north, africa, to, promote, a, collective, amazigh, ethnic, identity, and, to, militate, for, greater, linguistic, rights, and, cultural, recognition, the, indigenous, populations, of, the, maghreb, region, of, north, africa, are, collectively, known, as, berbers, or, amazigh, in, english, tribal, titles, such, as, barabara, and, beraberata, appear, in, egyptian, inscriptions, of, 1700, and, 1300, b, c, and, the, berbers, were, probably, intimately, related, with, the, egyptians, in, very, early, times, thus, the, true, ethnical, name, may, have, become, confused, with, barbari, the, designation, naturally, used, by, classical, conquerors, the, plural, form, imazighen, is, sometimes, also, used, in, english, while, berber, is, more, widely, known, among, english, speakers, its, usage, is, a, subject, of, debate, due, to, its, historical, background, as, an, exonym, and, present, equivalence, with, the, arabic, word, for, barbarian, historically, berbers, did, not, refer, to, themselves, as, berbers, amazigh, but, had, their, own, terms, to, refer, to, themselves, for, example, the, kabyles, use, the, term, leqbayel, to, refer, to, their, own, people, while, the, chaouis, identified, themselves, as, ishawiyen, instead, of, berber, amazigh, st, phane, gsell, proposed, the, translation, noble, free, for, the, term, amazigh, based, on, leo, africanus, s, translation, of, awal, amazigh, as, noble, language, referring, to, berber, languages, this, definition, remains, disputed, and, is, largely, seen, as, an, undue, extrapolation, the, term, amazigh, also, has, a, cognate, in, the, tuareg, amajegh, meaning, noble, mazigh, was, used, as, a, tribal, surname, in, roman, mauretania, caesariensis, abraham, isaac, laredo, proposes, that, the, term, amazigh, could, be, derived, from, mezeg, which, is, the, name, of, dedan, of, sheba, in, the, targum, ibn, khaldun, says, the, berbers, were, descendants, of, barbar, the, son, of, tamalla, son, of, mazigh, son, of, canaan, son, of, ham, son, of, noah, the, numidian, mauri, and, libu, populations, of, antiquity, are, typically, understood, to, refer, to, approximately, the, same, population, as, modern, berbers, the, maghreb, region, in, northwestern, africa, is, believed, to, have, been, inhabited, by, berbers, from, at, least, 10, 000, bc, cave, paintings, which, have, been, dated, to, twelve, millennia, before, present, have, been, found, in, the, tassili, n, ajjer, region, of, southeastern, algeria, other, rock, art, has, been, discovered, at, tadrart, acacus, in, the, libyan, desert, a, neolithic, society, marked, by, domestication, and, subsistence, agriculture, and, richly, depicted, in, the, tassili, n, ajjer, paintings, developed, and, predominated, in, the, saharan, and, mediterranean, region, the, maghreb, of, northern, africa, between, 6000, and, 2000, bc, until, the, classical, period, prehistoric, tifinagh, inscriptions, were, found, in, the, oran, region, during, the, pre, roman, era, several, successive, independent, states, massylii, existed, before, king, masinissa, unified, the, people, of, numidia, the, areas, of, north, africa, that, have, retained, the, berber, language, and, traditions, best, have, been, in, general, algeria, libya, morocco, and, tunisia, much, of, berber, culture, is, still, celebrated, among, the, cultural, elite, in, morocco, and, algeria, especially, in, the, kabylia, the, aur, s, and, the, atlas, mountains, the, kabyles, were, one, of, the, few, peoples, in, north, africa, who, remained, independent, during, successive, rule, by, the, carthaginians, the, romans, the, byzantines, the, vandals, and, the, ottoman, turks, even, after, the, arab, conquest, of, north, africa, the, kabyle, people, still, maintained, possession, of, their, mountains, according, to, the, roman, historian, gaius, sallustius, crispus, the, original, people, of, north, africa, are, the, gaetulians, and, the, libyans, they, were, the, prehistoric, peoples, that, crossed, to, africa, from, iberia, then, much, later, hercules, and, his, army, crossed, from, iberia, to, north, africa, where, his, army, intermarried, with, the, local, populace, and, settled, the, region, permanently, the, medes, of, his, army, that, married, the, libyans, formed, the, maur, people, while, the, other, part, of, his, army, formed, the, nomadas, or, as, they, are, today, known, as, the, numidians, which, later, on, united, all, of, berber, tribes, of, north, africa, under, the, rule, of, massinissa, according, to, the, al, fi, rist, the, barber, i, e, berbers, comprised, one, of, seven, principal, races, in, africa, the, medieval, tunisian, scholar, ibn, khaldun, 1332, 1406, recounting, the, oral, traditions, prevalent, in, his, day, sets, down, two, popular, opinions, as, to, the, origin, of, the, berbers, according, to, one, opinion, they, are, descended, from, canaan, son, of, ham, and, have, for, ancestors, berber, son, of, temla, son, of, maz, gh, son, of, canaan, son, of, ham, a, son, of, noah, alternatively, abou, bekr, mohammed, es, souli, 947, ce, held, that, they, are, descended, from, berber, the, son, of, keloudjm, casluhim, the, son, of, mesraim, the, son, of, ham, they, belong, to, a, powerful, formidable, brave, and, numerous, people, a, true, people, like, so, many, others, the, world, has, seen, like, the, arabs, the, persians, the, greeks, and, the, romans, the, men, who, belong, to, this, family, of, peoples, have, inhabited, the, maghreb, since, the, beginning, as, of, about, 5000, bc, the, populations, of, north, africa, were, descended, primarily, from, the, iberomaurusian, and, capsian, cultures, with, a, more, recent, intrusion, being, associated, with, the, neolithic, revolution, the, proto, berber, tribes, evolved, from, these, prehistoric, communities, during, the, late, bronze, and, early, iron, ages, uniparental, dna, analysis, has, established, ties, between, berbers, and, other, afroasiatic, speakers, in, africa, most, of, these, populations, belong, to, the, e1b1b, paternal, haplogroup, with, berber, speakers, having, among, the, highest, frequencies, of, this, lineage, additionally, genomic, analysis, found, that, berber, and, other, maghreb, communities, have, a, high, frequency, of, an, ancestral, component, that, originated, in, the, near, east, this, maghrebi, element, peaks, among, tunisian, berbers, this, ancestry, is, related, to, the, coptic, ethio, somali, component, which, diverged, from, these, and, other, west, eurasian, affiliated, components, before, the, holocene, in, 2013, iberomaurusian, skeletons, from, the, prehistoric, sites, of, taforalt, and, afalou, in, the, maghreb, were, also, analyzed, for, ancient, dna, all, of, the, specimens, belonged, to, maternal, clades, associated, with, either, north, africa, or, the, northern, and, southern, mediterranean, littoral, indicating, gene, flow, between, these, areas, since, the, epipaleolithic, the, ancient, taforalt, individuals, carried, the, mtdna, haplogroups, u6, h, jt, and, v, which, points, to, population, continuity, in, the, region, dating, from, the, iberomaurusian, period, human, fossils, excavated, at, the, ifri, n, amr, ou, moussa, site, in, morocco, have, been, radiocarbon, dated, to, the, early, neolithic, period, c, 5, 000, bc, ancient, dna, analysis, of, these, specimens, indicates, that, they, carried, paternal, haplotypes, related, to, the, e1b1b1b1a, e, m81, subclade, and, the, maternal, haplogroups, u6a, and, m1, all, of, which, are, frequent, among, present, day, communities, in, the, maghreb, these, ancient, individuals, also, bore, an, autochthonous, maghrebi, genomic, component, that, peaks, among, modern, berbers, indicating, that, they, were, ancestral, to, populations, in, the, area, additionally, fossils, excavated, at, the, kelif, el, boroud, site, near, rabat, were, found, to, carry, the, broadly, distributed, paternal, haplogroup, t, m184, as, well, as, the, maternal, haplogroups, k1, t2, and, x2, the, latter, of, which, were, common, mtdna, lineages, in, neolithic, europe, and, anatolia, these, ancient, individuals, likewise, bore, the, berber, associated, maghrebi, genomic, component, this, altogether, indicates, that, the, late, neolithic, kehf, el, baroud, inhabitants, were, ancestral, to, contemporary, populations, in, the, area, but, also, likely, experienced, gene, flow, from, europe, the, late, neolithic, kehf, el, baroud, inhabitants, were, modelled, as, being, of, about, 50, local, north, african, ancestry, and, 50, early, european, farmer, eef, ancestry, it, was, suggested, that, eef, ancestry, had, entered, north, africa, through, cardial, ware, colonists, from, iberia, sometime, between, 5000, and, 3000, bc, they, were, found, to, be, closely, related, to, the, guanches, of, the, canary, islands, the, authors, of, the, study, suggested, that, the, berbers, of, morocco, carried, a, substantial, amount, of, eef, ancestry, before, the, establishment, of, roman, colonies, in, berber, africa, the, great, tribes, of, berbers, in, classical, antiquity, when, they, were, often, known, as, ancient, libyans, were, said, to, be, three, roughly, from, west, to, east, the, mauri, the, numidians, near, carthage, and, the, gaetulians, the, mauri, inhabited, the, far, west, ancient, mauretania, now, morocco, and, central, algeria, the, numidians, occupied, the, regions, between, the, mauri, and, the, city, state, of, carthage, both, the, mauri, and, the, numidians, had, significant, sedentary, populations, living, in, villages, and, their, peoples, both, tilled, the, land, and, tended, herds, the, gaetulians, lived, to, the, near, south, on, the, northern, margins, of, the, sahara, and, were, less, settled, with, predominantly, pastoral, elements, 41f, for, their, part, the, phoenicians, semitic, speaking, canaanites, came, from, perhaps, the, most, advanced, multicultural, sphere, then, existing, the, western, coast, of, the, fertile, crescent, region, of, west, asia, accordingly, the, material, culture, of, phoenicia, was, likely, more, functional, and, efficient, and, their, knowledge, more, advanced, than, that, of, the, early, berbers, hence, the, interactions, between, berbers, and, phoenicians, were, often, asymmetrical, the, phoenicians, worked, to, keep, their, cultural, cohesion, and, ethnic, solidarity, and, continuously, refreshed, their, close, connection, with, tyre, the, mother, city, 37, the, earliest, phoenician, coastal, outposts, were, probably, meant, merely, to, resupply, and, service, ships, bound, for, the, lucrative, metals, trade, with, the, iberians, and, perhaps, at, first, regarded, trade, with, the, berbers, as, unprofitable, however, the, phoenicians, eventually, established, strategic, colonial, cities, in, many, berber, areas, including, sites, outside, of, present, day, tunisia, such, as, the, settlements, at, oea, leptis, magna, sabratha, in, libya, volubilis, chellah, and, mogador, now, in, morocco, as, in, tunisia, these, centres, were, trading, hubs, and, later, offered, support, for, resource, development, such, as, processing, olive, oil, at, volubilis, and, tyrian, purple, dye, at, mogador, for, their, part, most, berbers, maintained, their, independence, as, farmers, or, semi, pastorals, although, due, to, the, example, of, carthage, their, organized, politics, increased, in, scope, and, sophistication, in, fact, for, a, time, their, numerical, and, military, superiority, the, best, horse, riders, of, that, time, enabled, some, berber, kingdoms, to, impose, a, tribute, on, carthage, a, condition, that, continued, into, the, 5th, century, bc, 64, 65, also, due, to, the, berbero, libyan, meshwesh, dynasty, s, rule, of, egypt, 945, 715, bc, the, berbers, near, carthage, commanded, significant, respect, yet, probably, appearing, more, rustic, than, the, elegant, libyan, pharaohs, on, the, nile, correspondingly, in, early, carthage, careful, attention, was, given, to, securing, the, most, favourable, treaties, with, the, berber, chieftains, which, included, intermarriage, between, them, and, the, punic, aristocracy, in, this, regard, perhaps, the, legend, about, dido, the, foundress, of, carthage, as, related, by, trogus, is, apposite, her, refusal, to, wed, the, mauritani, chieftain, hiarbus, might, be, indicative, of, the, complexity, of, the, politics, involved, eventually, the, phoenician, trading, stations, would, evolve, into, permanent, settlements, and, later, into, small, towns, which, would, presumably, require, a, wide, variety, of, goods, as, well, as, sources, of, food, which, could, be, satisfied, through, trade, with, the, berbers, yet, here, too, the, phoenicians, probably, would, be, drawn, into, organizing, and, directing, such, local, trade, and, also, into, managing, agricultural, production, in, the, 5th, century, bc, carthage, expanded, its, territory, acquiring, cape, bon, and, the, fertile, wadi, majardah, later, establishing, control, over, productive, farmlands, for, several, hundred, kilometres, appropriation, of, such, wealth, in, land, by, the, phoenicians, would, surely, provoke, some, resistance, from, the, berbers, although, in, warfare, too, the, technical, training, social, organization, and, weaponry, of, the, phoenicians, would, seem, to, work, against, the, tribal, berbers, this, social, cultural, interaction, in, early, carthage, has, been, summarily, described, lack, of, contemporary, written, records, makes, the, drawing, of, conclusions, here, uncertain, which, can, only, be, based, on, inference, and, reasonable, conjecture, about, matters, of, social, nuance, yet, it, appears, that, the, phoenicians, generally, did, not, interact, with, the, berbers, as, economic, equals, but, employed, their, agricultural, labour, and, their, household, services, whether, by, hire, or, indenture, many, became, sharecroppers, 86, for, a, period, the, berbers, were, in, constant, revolt, and, in, 396, there, was, a, great, uprising, thousands, of, rebels, streamed, down, from, the, mountains, and, invaded, punic, territory, carrying, the, serfs, of, the, countryside, along, with, them, the, carthaginians, were, obliged, to, withdraw, within, their, walls, and, were, besieged, yet, the, berbers, lacked, cohesion, and, although, 200, 000, strong, at, one, point, they, succumbed, to, hunger, their, leaders, were, offered, bribes, and, they, gradually, broke, up, and, returned, to, their, homes, 125, 172, thereafter, a, series, of, revolts, took, place, among, the, libyans, from, the, fourth, century, onwards, 81, the, berbers, had, become, involuntary, hosts, to, the, settlers, from, the, east, and, were, obliged, to, accept, the, dominance, of, carthage, for, centuries, nonetheless, therein, they, persisted, largely, unassimilated, as, a, separate, submerged, entity, as, a, culture, of, mostly, passive, urban, and, rural, poor, within, the, civil, structures, created, by, punic, rule, in, addition, and, most, importantly, the, berber, peoples, also, formed, quasi, independent, satellite, societies, along, the, steppes, of, the, frontier, and, beyond, where, a, minority, continued, as, free, tribal, republics, while, benefiting, from, punic, material, culture, and, political, military, institutions, these, peripheral, berbers, also, called, libyans, while, maintaining, their, own, identity, culture, and, traditions, continued, to, develop, their, own, agricultural, skills, and, village, societies, while, living, with, the, newcomers, from, the, east, in, an, asymmetric, symbiosis, as, the, centuries, passed, a, society, of, punic, people, of, phoenician, descent, but, born, in, africa, called, libyphoenicians, emerged, there, this, term, later, came, to, be, applied, also, to, berbers, acculturated, to, urban, phoenician, culture, 65, 84, 86, yet, the, whole, notion, of, a, berber, apprenticeship, to, the, punic, civilization, has, been, called, an, exaggeration, sustained, by, a, point, of, view, fundamentally, foreign, to, the, berbers, 52, 58, a, population, of, mixed, ancestry, berber, and, punic, evolved, there, and, there, would, develop, recognized, niches, in, which, berbers, had, proven, their, utility, for, example, the, punic, state, began, to, field, berber, numidian, cavalry, under, their, commanders, on, a, regular, basis, the, berbers, eventually, were, required, to, provide, soldiers, at, first, unlikely, paid, except, in, booty, which, by, the, fourth, century, bc, became, the, largest, single, element, in, the, carthaginian, army, 86, yet, in, times, of, stress, at, carthage, when, a, foreign, force, might, be, pushing, against, the, city, state, some, berbers, would, see, it, as, an, opportunity, to, advance, their, interests, given, their, otherwise, low, status, in, punic, society, thus, when, the, greeks, under, agathocles, 361, 289, bc, of, sicily, landed, at, cape, bon, and, threatened, carthage, in, 310, bc, there, were, berbers, under, ailymas, who, went, over, to, the, invading, greeks, 172, during, the, long, second, punic, war, 218, 201, bc, with, rome, see, below, the, berber, king, masinissa, c, 240, c, 148, bc, joined, with, the, invading, roman, general, scipio, resulting, in, the, war, ending, defeat, of, carthage, at, zama, despite, the, presence, of, their, renowned, general, hannibal, on, the, other, hand, the, berber, king, syphax, d, 202, bc, had, supported, carthage, the, romans, too, read, these, cues, so, that, they, cultivated, their, berber, alliances, and, subsequently, favored, the, berbers, who, advanced, their, interests, following, the, roman, victory, carthage, was, faulted, by, her, ancient, rivals, for, the, harsh, treatment, of, her, subjects, as, well, as, for, greed, and, cruelty, 83, her, libyan, berber, sharecroppers, for, example, were, required, to, pay, half, of, their, crops, as, tribute, to, the, city, state, during, the, emergency, of, the, first, punic, war, the, normal, exaction, taken, by, carthage, was, likely, an, extremely, burdensome, one, quarter, 80, carthage, once, famously, attempted, to, reduce, the, number, of, its, libyan, and, foreign, soldiers, leading, to, the, mercenary, war, 240, 237, bc, 203, 209, the, city, state, also, seemed, to, reward, those, leaders, known, to, deal, ruthlessly, with, its, subject, peoples, hence, the, frequent, berber, insurrections, moderns, fault, carthage, for, failure, to, bind, her, subjects, to, herself, as, rome, did, yet, rome, and, the, italians, held, far, more, in, common, perhaps, than, did, carthage, and, the, berbers, nonetheless, a, modern, criticism, is, that, the, carthaginians, did, themselves, a, disservice, by, failing, to, promote, the, common, shared, quality, of, life, in, a, properly, organized, city, that, inspires, loyalty, particularly, with, regard, to, the, berbers, 86, 87, again, the, tribute, demanded, by, carthage, was, onerous, he, most, ruinous, tribute, was, imposed, and, exacted, with, unsparing, rigour, from, the, subject, native, states, and, no, slight, one, either, from, the, cognate, phoenician, states, hence, arose, that, universal, disaffection, or, rather, that, deadly, hatred, on, the, part, of, her, foreign, subjects, and, even, of, the, phoenician, dependencies, toward, carthage, on, which, every, invader, of, africa, could, safely, count, as, his, surest, support, this, was, the, fundamental, the, ineradicable, weakness, of, the, carthaginian, empire, the, punic, relationship, with, the, majority, of, the, berbers, continued, throughout, the, life, of, carthage, the, unequal, development, of, material, culture, and, social, organization, perhaps, fated, the, relationship, to, be, an, uneasy, one, a, long, term, cause, of, punic, instability, there, was, no, melding, of, the, peoples, it, remained, a, source, of, stress, and, a, point, of, weakness, for, carthage, yet, there, were, degrees, of, convergence, on, several, particulars, discoveries, of, mutual, advantage, occasions, of, friendship, and, family, the, berbers, gain, historicity, gradually, during, the, roman, era, byzantine, authors, mention, the, mazikes, amazigh, as, tribal, people, raiding, the, monasteries, of, cyrenaica, garamantia, was, a, notable, berber, kingdom, that, flourished, in, the, fezzan, area, of, modern, day, libya, in, the, sahara, desert, between, 400, bc, and, 600, ad, roman, era, cyrenaica, became, a, center, of, early, christianity, some, pre, islamic, berbers, were, christians, there, is, a, strong, correlation, between, adherence, to, the, donatist, doctrine, and, being, a, berber, ascribed, to, the, doctrine, matching, their, culture, as, well, as, their, being, alienated, from, the, dominant, roman, culture, of, the, catholic, church, some, perhaps, jewish, and, some, adhered, to, their, traditional, polytheist, religion, the, roman, era, authors, apuleius, and, st, augustine, were, born, in, numidia, as, were, three, popes, one, of, whom, pope, victor, i, served, during, the, reign, of, roman, emperor, septimius, severus, who, was, a, north, african, of, roman, punic, ancestry, perhaps, with, some, berber, blood, numidia, 202, 46, bc, was, an, ancient, berber, kingdom, in, modern, algeria, and, part, of, tunisia, it, later, alternated, between, being, a, roman, province, and, being, a, roman, client, state, the, kingdom, was, located, on, the, eastern, border, of, modern, algeria, bordered, by, the, roman, province, of, mauretania, in, modern, algeria, and, morocco, to, the, west, the, roman, province, of, africa, modern, tunisia, to, the, east, the, mediterranean, to, the, north, and, the, sahara, desert, to, the, south, its, people, were, the, numidians, the, name, numidia, was, first, applied, by, polybius, and, other, historians, during, the, third, century, bc, to, indicate, the, territory, west, of, carthage, including, the, entire, north, of, algeria, as, far, as, the, river, mulucha, muluya, about, 160, kilometres, 100, mi, west, of, oran, the, numidians, were, conceived, of, as, two, great, groups, the, massylii, in, eastern, numidia, and, the, masaesyli, in, the, west, during, the, first, part, of, the, second, punic, war, the, eastern, massylii, under, king, gala, were, allied, with, carthage, while, the, western, masaesyli, under, king, syphax, were, allied, with, rome, in, 206, bc, the, new, king, of, the, massylii, masinissa, allied, himself, with, rome, and, syphax, of, the, masaesyli, switched, his, allegiance, to, the, carthaginian, side, at, the, end, of, the, war, the, victorious, romans, gave, all, of, numidia, to, masinissa, at, the, time, of, his, death, in, 148, bc, masinissa, s, territory, extended, from, mauretania, to, the, boundary, of, carthaginian, territory, and, southeast, as, far, as, cyrenaica, so, that, numidia, entirely, surrounded, carthage, except, towards, the, sea, masinissa, was, succeeded, by, his, son, micipsa, when, micipsa, died, in, 118, bc, he, was, succeeded, jointly, by, his, two, sons, hiempsal, i, and, adherbal, and, masinissa, s, illegitimate, grandson, jugurtha, of, berber, origin, who, was, very, popular, among, the, numidians, hiempsal, and, jugurtha, quarreled, immediately, after, the, death, of, micipsa, jugurtha, had, hiempsal, killed, which, led, to, open, war, with, adherbal, after, jugurtha, defeated, him, in, open, battle, adherbal, fled, to, rome, for, help, the, roman, officials, allegedly, due, to, bribes, but, perhaps, more, likely, out, of, a, desire, to, quickly, end, conflict, in, a, profitable, client, kingdom, sought, to, settle, the, quarrel, by, dividing, numidia, into, two, parts, jugurtha, was, assigned, the, western, half, however, soon, after, conflict, broke, out, again, leading, to, the, jugurthine, war, between, rome, and, numidia, in, antiquity, mauretania, 3rd, century, bc, 44, bc, was, an, ancient, mauri, berber, kingdom, in, modern, morocco, and, part, of, algeria, it, became, a, client, state, of, the, roman, empire, in, 33, bc, after, the, death, of, king, bocchus, ii, then, a, full, roman, province, in, ad, 40, after, the, death, of, its, last, king, ptolemy, of, mauretania, a, member, of, the, ptolemaic, dynasty, according, to, historians, of, the, middle, ages, the, berbers, were, divided, into, two, branches, butr, and, baranis, known, also, as, botr, and, barn, s, descended, from, mazigh, ancestors, who, were, themselves, divided, into, tribes, and, subtribes, each, region, of, the, maghreb, contained, several, fully, independent, tribes, e, g, sanhaja, houaras, zenata, masmuda, kutama, awraba, barghawata, etc, the, mauro, roman, kingdom, was, an, independent, christian, berber, kingdom, centred, in, the, capital, city, of, altava, present, day, algeria, which, controlled, much, of, the, ancient, roman, province, of, mauretania, caesariensis, berber, christian, communities, within, the, maghreb, all, but, disappeared, under, islamic, rule, the, indigenous, christian, population, in, some, nefzaoua, villages, persisted, until, the, 14th, century, several, berber, dynasties, emerged, during, the, middle, ages, in, the, maghreb, and, al, andalus, the, most, notable, are, the, zirids, ifriqiya, 973, 1148, the, hammadids, western, ifriqiya, 1014, 1152, the, almoravid, dynasty, morocco, and, al, andalus, 1040, 1147, the, almohads, morocco, and, al, andalus, 1147, 1248, the, hafsids, ifriqiya, 1229, 1574, the, zianids, tlemcen, 1235, 1556, the, marinids, morocco, 1248, 1465, and, the, wattasids, morocco, 1471, 1554, before, the, eleventh, century, most, of, northwest, africa, had, become, a, berber, speaking, muslim, area, unlike, the, conquests, of, previous, religions, and, cultures, the, coming, of, islam, which, was, spread, by, arabs, was, to, have, extensive, and, long, lasting, effects, on, the, maghreb, the, new, faith, in, its, various, forms, would, penetrate, nearly, all, segments, of, berber, society, bringing, with, it, armies, learned, men, and, fervent, mystics, and, in, large, part, replacing, tribal, practices, and, loyalties, with, new, social, norms, and, political, idioms, a, further, arabization, of, the, region, was, in, large, part, due, to, the, arrival, of, the, banu, hilal, a, tribe, sent, by, the, fatimids, of, egypt, to, punish, the, berber, zirid, dynasty, for, having, abandoned, shiism, the, banu, hilal, reduced, the, zirids, to, a, few, coastal, towns, and, took, over, much, of, the, plains, resulting, in, the, spread, of, nomadism, to, areas, where, agriculture, had, previously, been, dominant, besides, the, arabian, influence, north, africa, also, saw, an, influx, via, the, barbary, slave, trade, of, europeans, with, some, estimates, placing, the, number, of, european, slaves, brought, to, north, africa, during, the, ottoman, period, to, be, as, high, as, 1, 25, million, interactions, with, neighboring, sudanic, empires, traders, and, nomads, from, other, parts, of, africa, also, left, impressions, upon, the, berber, people, the, first, arabian, military, expeditions, into, the, maghreb, between, 642, and, 669, resulted, in, the, spread, of, islam, these, early, forays, from, a, base, in, egypt, occurred, under, local, initiative, rather, than, under, orders, from, the, central, caliphate, but, when, the, seat, of, the, caliphate, moved, from, medina, to, damascus, the, umayyads, a, muslim, dynasty, ruling, from, 661, to, 750, recognized, that, the, strategic, necessity, of, dominating, the, mediterranean, dictated, a, concerted, military, effort, on, the, north, african, front, in, 670, therefore, an, arab, army, under, uqba, ibn, nafi, established, the, town, of, qayrawan, about, 160, kilometres, south, of, modern, tunis, and, used, it, as, a, base, for, further, operations, abu, al, muhajir, dinar, uqba, s, successor, pushed, westward, into, algeria, and, eventually, worked, out, a, modus, vivendi, with, kusaila, the, ruler, of, an, extensive, confederation, of, christian, berbers, kusaila, who, had, been, based, in, tlemcen, became, a, muslim, and, moved, his, headquarters, to, takirwan, near, al, qayrawan, this, harmony, was, short, lived, arabian, and, berber, forces, controlled, the, region, in, turn, until, 697, umayyad, forces, conquered, carthage, in, 698, expelling, the, byzantines, and, in, 703, decisively, defeated, dihya, s, berber, coalition, at, the, battle, of, tabarka, by, 711, umayyad, forces, helped, by, berber, converts, to, islam, had, conquered, all, of, north, africa, governors, appointed, by, the, umayyad, caliphs, ruled, from, kairouan, capital, of, the, new, wilaya, province, of, ifriqiya, which, covered, tripolitania, the, western, part, of, modern, libya, tunisia, and, eastern, algeria, the, spread, of, islam, among, the, berbers, did, not, guarantee, their, support, for, the, arab, dominated, caliphate, due, to, the, discriminatory, attitude, of, the, arabs, the, ruling, arabs, alienated, the, berbers, by, taxing, them, heavily, treating, converts, as, second, class, muslims, and, worst, of, all, by, enslaving, them, as, a, result, widespread, opposition, took, the, form, of, open, revolt, in, 739, 740, under, the, banner, of, ibadi, islam, the, ibadi, had, been, fighting, umayyad, rule, in, the, east, and, many, berbers, were, attracted, by, the, sect, s, seemingly, egalitarian, precepts, after, the, revolt, ibadis, established, a, number, of, theocratic, tribal, kingdoms, most, of, which, had, short, and, troubled, histories, but, others, such, as, sijilmasa, and, tlemcen, which, straddled, the, principal, trade, routes, proved, more, viable, and, prospered, in, 750, the, abbasids, who, succeeded, the, umayyads, as, muslim, rulers, moved, the, caliphate, to, baghdad, and, reestablished, caliphal, authority, in, ifriqiya, appointing, ibrahim, ibn, al, aghlab, as, governor, in, kairouan, though, nominally, serving, at, the, caliph, s, pleasure, al, aghlab, and, his, successors, the, aghlabids, ruled, independently, until, 909, presiding, over, a, court, that, became, a, center, of, learning, and, culture, just, to, the, west, of, aghlabid, lands, abd, ar, rahman, ibn, rustam, ruled, most, of, the, central, maghreb, from, tahert, south, west, of, algiers, the, rulers, of, the, rustamid, imamate, 761, 909, each, an, ibadi, imam, were, elected, by, leading, citizens, the, imams, gained, a, reputation, for, honesty, piety, and, justice, the, court, at, tahert, was, noted, for, its, support, of, scholarship, in, mathematics, astronomy, astrology, theology, and, law, the, rustamid, imams, failed, by, choice, or, by, neglect, to, organize, a, reliable, standing, army, this, important, factor, accompanied, by, the, dynasty, s, eventual, collapse, into, decadence, opened, the, way, for, tahert, s, demise, under, the, assault, of, the, fatimids, mahdia, was, founded, by, the, fatimids, under, the, caliph, abdallah, al, mahdi, in, 921, and, made, the, capital, city, of, ifriqiya, by, caliph, abdallah, el, fatimi, it, was, chosen, as, the, capital, because, of, its, proximity, to, the, sea, and, the, promontory, on, which, an, important, military, settlement, had, been, since, the, time, of, the, phoenicians, the, muslims, who, invaded, the, iberian, peninsula, in, 711, were, mainly, berbers, and, were, led, by, a, berber, tariq, ibn, ziyad, under, the, suzerainty, of, the, arab, caliph, of, damascus, abd, al, malik, ibn, marwan, and, his, north, african, viceroy, musa, ibn, nusayr, due, to, subsequent, antagonism, between, arabs, and, berbers, and, due, to, the, fact, that, most, of, the, histories, of, al, andalus, were, written, from, an, arab, perspective, the, berber, role, is, understated, in, the, available, sources, the, biographical, dictionary, of, ibn, khallikan, preserves, the, record, of, the, berber, predominance, in, the, invasion, of, 711, in, the, entry, on, tariq, ibn, ziyad, a, second, mixed, army, of, arabs, and, berbers, came, in, 712, under, ibn, nusayr, himself, they, supposedly, helped, the, umayyad, caliph, abd, ar, rahman, i, in, al, andalus, because, his, mother, was, a, berber, english, medievalist, roger, collins, suggests, that, if, the, forces, that, invaded, the, iberian, peninsula, were, predominantly, berber, it, is, because, there, were, insufficient, arab, forces, in, africa, to, maintain, control, of, africa, and, attack, iberia, at, the, same, time, 98, thus, although, north, africa, had, only, been, conquered, about, a, dozen, years, previously, the, arabs, already, employed, forces, of, the, defeated, berbers, to, carry, out, their, next, invasion, 98, this, would, explain, the, predominance, of, berbers, over, arabs, in, the, initial, invasion, in, addition, collins, argues, that, berber, social, organization, made, it, possible, for, the, arabs, to, recruit, entire, tribal, units, into, their, armies, making, the, defeated, berbers, excellent, military, auxiliaries, 99, the, berber, forces, in, the, invasion, of, iberia, came, from, ifriqiya, or, as, far, away, as, tripolitania, governor, as, samh, distributed, land, to, the, conquering, forces, apparently, by, tribe, though, it, is, difficult, to, determine, from, the, few, historical, sources, available, 48, 49, it, was, at, this, time, that, the, positions, of, arabs, and, berbers, were, regularized, across, the, iberian, peninsula, berbers, were, positioned, in, many, of, the, most, mountainous, regions, of, spain, such, as, granada, the, pyrenees, cantabria, and, galicia, collins, suggests, this, may, be, because, some, berbers, were, familiar, with, mountain, terrain, whereas, the, arabs, were, not, 49, 50, by, the, late, 710s, there, was, a, berber, governor, in, leon, or, gijon, 149, when, pelagius, revolted, in, asturias, it, was, against, a, berber, governor, this, revolt, challenged, as, samh, s, plans, to, settle, berbers, in, the, galician, and, cantabrian, mountains, and, by, the, middle, of, the, eighth, century, it, seems, there, was, no, more, berber, presence, in, galicia, 49, 50, the, expulsion, of, the, berber, garrisons, from, central, asturias, following, the, battle, of, covadonga, contributed, to, the, eventual, formation, of, the, independent, asturian, kingdom, 63, many, berbers, were, settled, in, what, were, then, the, frontier, lands, near, toledo, talavera, and, m, rida, 195, m, rida, becoming, a, major, berber, stronghold, in, the, eighth, century, 201, the, berber, garrison, in, talavera, would, later, be, commanded, by, amrus, ibn, yusuf, and, was, involved, in, military, operations, against, rebels, in, toledo, in, the, late, 700s, and, early, 800s, 210, berbers, were, also, initially, settled, in, the, eastern, pyrenees, and, catalonia, 88, 89, 195, they, were, not, settled, in, the, major, cities, of, the, south, and, were, generally, kept, in, the, frontier, zones, away, from, cordoba, 207, roger, collins, cites, the, work, of, pierre, guichard, to, argue, that, berber, groups, in, iberia, retained, their, own, distinctive, social, organization, 90, according, to, this, traditional, view, of, arab, and, berber, culture, in, the, iberian, peninsula, berber, society, was, highly, impermeable, to, outside, influences, whereas, arabs, became, assimilated, and, hispanized, 90, some, support, for, the, view, that, berbers, assimilated, less, comes, from, an, excavation, of, an, islamic, cemetery, in, northern, spain, which, reveals, that, the, berbers, accompanying, the, initial, invasion, brought, their, families, with, them, from, north, africa, in, 731, the, eastern, pyrenees, were, under, the, control, of, berber, forces, garrisoned, in, the, major, towns, under, the, command, of, munnuza, munnuza, attempted, a, berber, uprising, against, the, arabs, in, spain, citing, mistreatment, of, berbers, by, arabic, judges, in, north, africa, and, made, an, alliance, with, duke, eudo, of, aquitaine, however, governor, abd, ar, rahman, attacked, munnuza, before, he, was, ready, and, besieging, him, defeated, him, at, cerdanya, because, of, the, alliance, with, munnuza, abd, ar, rahman, wanted, to, punish, eudo, and, his, punitive, expedition, ended, in, the, arab, defeat, at, poitiers, 88, 90, by, the, time, of, the, governor, uqba, and, possibly, as, early, as, 714, the, city, of, pamplona, was, occupied, by, a, berber, garrison, 205, 206, an, eighth, century, cemetery, has, been, discovered, with, 190, burials, all, according, to, islamic, custom, testifying, to, the, presence, of, this, garrison, 205, 206, in, 798, however, pamplona, is, recorded, as, being, under, a, banu, qasi, governor, mutarrif, ibn, musa, ibn, musa, lost, control, of, pamplona, to, a, popular, uprising, in, 806, pamplona, gave, its, allegiance, to, the, franks, and, in, 824, became, the, independent, kingdom, of, pamplona, these, events, put, an, end, to, the, berber, garrison, in, pamplona, 206, 208, medieval, egyptian, historian, al, hakam, wrote, that, there, was, a, major, berber, revolt, in, north, africa, in, 740, 741, led, by, masayra, the, chronicle, of, 754, calls, these, rebels, arures, which, collins, translates, as, heretics, arguing, it, is, a, reference, to, the, berber, rebels, ibadi, or, khariji, sympathies, 107, after, charles, martel, attacked, arab, ally, maurontus, at, marseille, in, 739, governor, uqba, planned, a, punitive, attack, against, the, franks, but, news, of, a, berber, revolt, in, north, africa, made, him, turn, back, when, he, reached, zaragoza, 92, instead, according, to, the, chronicle, of, 754, uqba, carried, out, an, attack, against, berber, fortresses, in, africa, initially, these, attacks, were, unsuccessful, but, eventually, uqba, destroyed, the, rebels, secured, all, the, crossing, points, to, spain, and, then, returned, to, his, governorship, 105, 106, although, masayra, was, killed, by, his, own, followers, the, revolt, spread, and, the, berber, rebels, defeated, three, arab, armies, 106, 108, after, the, defeat, of, the, third, army, which, included, elite, units, of, syrians, commanded, by, kulthum, and, balj, the, berber, revolt, spread, further, at, this, time, the, berber, military, colonies, in, spain, revolted, 108, at, the, same, time, uqba, died, and, was, replaced, by, ibn, qatan, by, this, time, the, berbers, controlled, most, of, the, north, of, the, iberian, peninsula, except, for, the, ebro, valley, and, were, menacing, toledo, ibn, qatan, invited, balj, and, his, syrian, troops, who, were, at, that, time, in, ceuta, to, cross, to, the, iberian, peninsula, to, fight, against, the, berbers, 109, 110, the, berbers, marched, south, in, three, columns, simultaneously, attacking, toledo, cordoba, and, the, ports, on, the, gibraltar, strait, however, ibn, qatan, s, sons, defeated, the, army, attacking, toledo, the, governor, s, forces, defeated, the, attack, on, cordoba, and, balj, defeated, the, attack, on, the, strait, after, this, balj, seized, power, by, marching, on, cordoba, and, executing, ibn, qatan, 108, collins, points, out, that, balj, s, troops, were, away, from, syria, just, when, the, abbasid, revolt, against, the, umayyads, broke, out, and, this, may, have, contributed, to, the, fall, of, the, umayyad, regime, 121, in, africa, the, berbers, were, hampered, by, divided, leadership, their, attack, on, kairouan, was, defeated, and, a, new, governor, of, africa, hanzala, ibn, safwan, proceeded, to, defeat, the, rebels, in, africa, and, then, to, impose, peace, between, balj, s, troops, and, the, existing, andalusi, arabs, 110, 111, roger, collins, argues, that, the, great, berber, revolt, facilitated, the, establishment, of, the, kingdom, of, asturias, and, altered, the, demographics, of, the, berber, population, in, the, iberian, peninsula, specifically, contributing, to, the, berber, departure, from, the, northwest, of, the, peninsula, 150, 151, when, the, arabs, first, invaded, the, peninsula, berber, groups, were, situated, in, the, northwest, however, due, to, the, berber, revolt, the, umayyad, governors, were, forced, to, protect, their, southern, flank, and, were, unable, to, mount, an, offense, against, the, asturians, some, presence, of, berbers, in, the, northwest, may, have, been, maintained, at, first, but, after, the, 740s, there, is, no, more, mention, of, the, northwestern, berbers, in, the, sources, 150, 151, 153, 154, when, the, umayyad, caliphate, was, overthrown, in, 750, a, grandson, of, caliph, hisham, abd, ar, rahman, escaped, to, north, africa, 115, and, hid, among, the, berbers, of, north, africa, for, five, years, a, persistent, tradition, states, that, this, is, because, his, mother, was, berber, 117, 118, and, that, he, first, took, refuge, with, the, nafsa, berbers, his, mother, s, people, as, the, governor, ibn, habib, was, seeking, him, he, then, fled, to, the, more, powerful, zenata, berber, confederacy, who, were, enemies, of, ibn, habib, since, the, zenata, had, been, part, of, the, initial, invasion, force, of, al, andalus, and, were, still, present, in, the, iberian, peninsula, this, gave, abd, ar, rahman, a, base, of, support, in, al, andalus, 119, although, he, seems, to, have, drawn, most, of, his, support, from, portions, of, balj, s, army, that, were, still, loyal, to, the, umayyads, 122, 123, 8, abd, ar, rahman, crossed, to, spain, in, 756, and, declared, himself, the, legitimate, umayyad, ruler, of, al, andalus, the, governor, yusuf, refused, to, submit, after, losing, the, initial, battle, near, cordoba, 124, 125, yusuf, fled, to, m, rida, where, he, raised, a, large, berber, army, with, which, he, marched, on, seville, but, was, defeated, by, forces, loyal, to, abd, ar, rahman, yusuf, fled, to, toledo, and, was, killed, either, on, the, way, or, after, reaching, that, place, 132, yusuf, s, cousin, hisham, ibn, urwa, continued, to, resist, abd, ar, rahman, from, toledo, until, 764, 133, and, the, sons, of, yusuf, revolted, again, in, 785, these, family, members, of, yusuf, members, of, the, fihri, tribe, were, effective, in, obtaining, support, from, berbers, in, their, revolts, against, the, umayyad, regime, 134, as, emir, of, al, andalus, abd, ar, rahman, i, faced, persistent, opposition, from, berber, groups, including, the, zenata, berbers, provided, much, of, yusuf, s, support, in, fighting, abd, ar, rahman, in, 774, zenata, berbers, were, involved, in, a, yemeni, revolt, in, the, area, of, seville, 168, andalusi, berber, salih, ibn, tarif, declared, himself, a, prophet, and, ruled, the, bargawata, berber, confederation, in, morocco, in, the, 770s, 169, in, 768, a, miknasa, berber, named, shaqya, ibn, abd, al, walid, declared, himself, a, fatimid, imam, claiming, descent, from, fatimah, and, ali, 168, he, is, mainly, known, from, the, work, of, the, arab, historian, ibn, al, athir, 170, who, wrote, that, shaqya, s, revolt, originated, in, the, area, of, modern, cuenca, an, area, of, spain, that, is, mountainous, and, difficult, to, traverse, shaqya, first, killed, the, umayyad, governor, of, the, fortress, of, santaver, near, roman, ercavica, and, subsequently, ravaged, the, district, surrounding, coria, abd, ar, rahman, sent, out, armies, to, fight, him, in, 769, 770, and, 771, but, shaqya, avoided, them, by, moving, into, the, mountains, in, 772, shaqya, defeated, an, umayyad, force, by, a, ruse, and, killed, the, governor, of, the, fortress, of, medellin, he, was, besieged, by, umayyads, in, 774, but, the, revolt, near, seville, forced, the, besieging, troops, to, withdraw, in, 775, a, berber, garrison, in, coria, declared, allegiance, to, shaqya, but, abd, ar, rahman, retook, the, town, and, chased, the, berbers, into, the, mountains, in, 776, shaqya, resisted, sieges, of, his, two, main, fortresses, at, santaver, and, shebat, ran, near, toledo, but, in, 777, he, was, betrayed, and, killed, by, his, own, followers, who, sent, his, head, to, abd, ar, rahman, 170, 171, roger, collins, notes, that, both, modern, historians, and, ancient, arab, authors, have, had, a, tendency, to, portray, shaqya, as, a, fanatic, followed, by, credulous, fanatics, and, to, argue, that, he, was, either, self, deluded, or, fraudulent, in, his, claim, of, fatimid, descent, 169, however, collins, considers, him, an, example, of, the, messianic, leaders, that, were, not, uncommon, among, berbers, at, that, time, and, earlier, he, compares, shaqya, to, idris, i, a, descendant, of, ali, accepted, by, the, zenata, berbers, who, founded, the, idrisid, dynasty, in, 788, and, to, salih, ibn, tarif, who, ruled, the, bargawata, berber, in, the, 770s, he, also, compares, these, leaders, to, pre, islamic, leaders, dihya, and, kusaila, 169, 170, in, 788, hisham, i, succeeded, abd, ar, rahman, as, emir, but, his, brother, sulayman, revolted, and, fled, to, the, berber, garrison, of, valencia, where, he, held, out, for, two, years, finally, sulayman, came, to, terms, with, hisham, and, went, into, exile, in, 790, together, with, other, brothers, who, had, rebelled, with, him, 203, 208, in, north, africa, sulayman, and, his, brothers, forged, alliances, with, local, berbers, especially, the, kharijite, ruler, of, tahert, after, the, death, of, hisham, and, the, accession, of, al, hakam, hisham, s, brothers, challenged, al, hakam, for, the, succession, abd, allah, crossed, over, to, valencia, first, in, 796, calling, on, the, allegiance, of, the, same, berber, garrison, that, sheltered, sulayman, years, earlier, 30, crossing, to, al, andalus, in, 798, sulayman, based, himself, in, elvira, now, granada, ecija, and, jaen, apparently, drawing, support, from, the, berbers, in, these, mountainous, southern, regions, sulayman, was, defeated, in, battle, in, 800, and, fled, to, the, berber, stronghold, in, m, rida, but, was, captured, before, reaching, it, and, executed, in, cordoba, 208, in, 797, the, berbers, of, talavera, played, a, major, part, in, defeating, a, revolt, against, al, hakam, in, toledo, 32, a, certain, ubayd, allah, ibn, hamir, of, toledo, rebelled, against, al, hakam, who, ordered, amrus, ibn, yusuf, the, commander, of, the, berbers, in, talavera, to, suppress, the, rebellion, amrus, negotiated, in, secret, with, the, banu, mahsa, faction, in, toledo, promising, them, the, governorship, if, they, betrayed, ibn, hamir, the, banu, mahsa, brought, ibn, hamir, s, head, to, amrus, in, talavera, however, there, was, a, feud, between, the, banu, mahsa, and, the, berbers, of, talavera, who, killed, all, the, banu, mahsa, amrus, sent, the, heads, of, the, banu, mahsa, along, with, that, of, ibn, hamir, to, al, hakam, in, cordoba, the, toledo, rebellion, was, sufficiently, weakened, that, amrus, was, able, to, enter, toledo, and, convince, its, inhabitants, to, submit, 32, 33, collins, argues, that, unassimilated, berber, garrisons, in, al, andalus, engaged, in, local, vendettas, and, feuds, such, as, the, conflict, with, the, banu, mahsa, 33, this, was, due, to, the, limited, power, of, the, umayyad, emir, s, central, authority, collins, states, that, the, berbers, despite, being, fellow, muslims, were, despised, by, those, who, claimed, arab, descent, 33, 34, as, well, as, having, feuds, with, arab, factions, the, berbers, sometimes, had, major, conflicts, with, the, local, communities, where, they, were, stationed, in, 794, the, berber, garrison, of, tarragona, massacred, the, inhabitants, of, the, city, tarragona, was, uninhabited, for, seven, years, until, the, frankish, conquest, of, barcelona, led, to, its, reoccupation, 34, berber, groups, were, involved, in, the, rebellion, of, umar, ibn, hafsun, from, 880, to, 915, 121, 122, ibn, hafsun, rebelled, in, 880, was, captured, then, escaped, in, 883, to, his, base, in, bobastro, there, he, formed, an, alliance, with, the, banu, rifa, tribe, of, berbers, who, had, a, stronghold, in, alhama, 122, he, then, formed, alliances, with, other, local, berber, clans, taking, the, towns, of, osuna, estepa, and, ecija, in, 889, he, captured, jaen, in, 892, 122, he, was, only, defeated, in, 915, by, abd, ar, rahman, iii, 125, throughout, the, ninth, century, the, berber, garrisons, were, one, of, the, main, military, supports, of, the, umayyad, regime, 37, although, they, had, caused, numerous, problems, for, abd, ar, rahman, i, collins, suggests, that, by, the, reign, of, al, hakam, the, berber, conflicts, with, arabs, and, native, iberians, meant, that, berbers, could, only, look, to, the, umayyad, regime, for, support, and, patronage, and, developed, solid, ties, of, loyalty, to, the, emirs, however, they, were, also, difficult, to, control, and, by, the, end, of, the, ninth, century, the, berber, frontier, garrisons, disappear, from, the, sources, collins, says, this, might, be, because, they, migrated, back, to, north, africa, or, gradually, assimilated, 37, new, waves, of, berber, settlers, arrived, in, al, andalus, in, the, 10th, century, brought, as, mercenaries, by, abd, ar, rahman, iii, who, proclaimed, himself, caliph, in, 929, to, help, him, in, his, campaigns, to, restore, umayyad, authority, in, areas, that, had, overthrown, it, during, the, reigns, of, the, previous, emirs, 103, 131, 168, these, new, berbers, lacked, any, familiarity, with, the, pattern, of, relationships, that, had, existed, in, al, andalus, in, the, 700s, and, 800s, 103, thus, they, were, not, involved, in, the, same, web, of, traditional, conflicts, and, loyalties, as, the, previously, already, existing, berber, garrisons, 168, new, frontier, settlements, were, built, for, the, new, berber, mercenaries, written, sources, state, that, some, of, the, mercenaries, were, placed, in, calatrava, which, was, refortified, 168, another, berber, settlement, called, vascos, west, of, toledo, is, not, mentioned, in, the, historical, sources, but, has, been, excavated, archaeologically, it, was, a, fortified, town, had, walls, and, a, separate, fortress, or, alcazar, two, cemeteries, have, also, been, discovered, the, town, was, established, in, the, 900s, as, a, frontier, town, for, berbers, probably, of, the, nafza, tribe, it, was, abandoned, soon, after, the, castilian, occupation, of, toledo, in, 1085, the, berber, inhabitants, took, all, their, possessions, with, them, 169, in, the, 900s, the, umayyad, caliphate, faced, a, challenge, from, the, fatimids, in, north, africa, the, fatimid, caliphate, of, the, 10th, century, was, established, by, the, kutama, berbers, after, taking, the, city, of, kairouan, and, overthrowing, the, aghlabids, in, 909, the, mahdi, ubayd, allah, was, installed, by, the, kutama, as, imam, and, caliph, which, posed, a, direct, challenge, to, the, umayyad, s, own, claim, 169, the, fatimids, gained, overlordship, over, the, idrisids, then, launched, a, conquest, of, the, maghreb, to, counter, the, threat, the, umayyads, crossed, the, strait, to, take, ceuta, in, 931, 171, and, actively, formed, alliances, with, berber, confederacies, such, as, the, zenata, and, the, awraba, rather, than, fighting, each, other, directly, the, fatimids, and, umayyads, competed, for, berber, allegiances, in, turn, this, provided, a, motivation, for, the, further, conversion, of, berbers, to, islam, many, of, the, berbers, particularly, farther, south, away, from, the, mediterranean, being, still, christian, and, pagan, 169, 170, in, turn, this, would, contribute, to, the, establishment, of, the, almoravid, dynasty, and, almohad, caliphate, which, would, have, a, major, impact, on, al, andalus, and, contribute, to, the, end, of, the, umayyad, caliphate, 170, with, the, help, of, his, new, mercenary, forces, abd, ar, rahman, launched, a, series, of, attacks, on, parts, of, the, iberian, peninsula, that, had, fallen, away, from, umayyad, allegiance, in, the, 920s, he, campaigned, against, the, areas, that, rebelled, under, umar, ibn, hafsun, and, refused, to, submit, until, the, 920s, he, conquered, m, rida, in, 928, 929, ceuta, in, 931, and, toledo, in, 932, 171, 172, in, 934, he, began, a, campaign, in, the, north, against, ramiro, ii, of, leon, and, muhammad, ibn, hashim, al, tujibi, the, governor, of, zaragoza, according, to, ibn, hayyan, after, inconclusively, confronting, al, tujibi, on, the, ebro, abd, ar, rahman, briefly, forced, the, kingdom, of, pamplona, into, submission, ravaged, castile, and, alava, and, met, ramiro, ii, in, an, inconclusive, battle, 171, 172, from, 935, to, 937, he, confronted, the, tujibids, defeating, them, in, 937, in, 939, ramiro, ii, defeated, the, combined, umayyad, and, tujibid, armies, in, the, battle, of, simancas, 146, 147, umayyad, influence, in, western, north, africa, spread, through, diplomacy, rather, than, conquest, 172, the, umayyads, sought, out, alliances, with, various, berber, confederacies, these, would, declare, loyalty, to, the, umayyad, caliphate, in, opposition, to, the, fatimids, the, umayyads, would, send, gifts, including, embroidered, silk, ceremonial, cloaks, during, this, time, mints, in, cities, on, the, moroccan, coast, fes, sijilmasa, sfax, and, al, nakur, occasionally, issued, coins, with, the, names, of, umayyad, caliphs, showing, the, extent, of, umayyad, diplomatic, influence, 172, the, text, of, a, letter, of, friendship, from, a, berber, leader, to, the, umayyad, caliph, has, been, preserved, in, the, work, of, isa, al, razi, during, abd, ar, rahman, s, reign, tensions, increased, between, the, three, distinct, components, of, the, muslim, community, in, al, andalus, berbers, saqaliba, european, slaves, and, those, of, arab, or, mixed, arab, and, gothic, descent, 175, following, abd, ar, rahman, s, proclamation, of, the, new, umayyad, caliphate, in, cordoba, the, umayyads, placed, a, great, emphasis, on, the, umayyad, membership, of, the, quraysh, tribe, 180, this, led, to, a, fashion, in, cordoba, for, claiming, pure, arab, ancestry, as, opposed, to, descent, from, freed, slaves, 181, claims, of, descent, from, visigothic, noble, families, also, became, common, 181, 182, however, an, immediately, detrimental, consequence, of, this, acute, consciousness, of, ancestry, was, the, revival, of, ethnic, disparagement, directed, in, particular, against, the, berbers, and, the, saqaliba, 182, when, the, fatimids, moved, their, capital, to, egypt, in, 969, they, left, north, africa, in, charge, of, viceroys, from, the, zirid, clan, of, sanhaja, berbers, who, were, fatimid, loyalists, and, enemies, of, the, zenata, 170, the, zirids, in, turn, divided, their, territories, assigning, some, to, the, hammadid, branch, of, the, family, to, govern, the, hammadids, became, independent, in, 1014, with, their, capital, at, qal, at, beni, hammad, with, the, withdrawal, of, the, fatimids, to, egypt, however, the, rivalry, with, the, umayyads, decreased, 170, al, hakam, ii, sent, muhammad, ibn, ab, mir, to, north, africa, in, 973, 974, to, act, as, qadi, al, qudat, chief, justice, to, the, berber, groups, that, had, accepted, umayyad, authority, ibn, ab, mir, was, treasurer, of, the, household, of, the, caliph, s, wife, and, children, director, of, the, mint, at, madinat, al, zahra, commander, of, the, cordoba, police, and, qadi, of, the, frontier, during, his, time, as, qadi, in, north, africa, ibn, abi, amir, developed, close, ties, with, the, north, african, berbers, 186, considerable, resentment, arose, in, cordoba, against, the, increasing, numbers, of, berbers, brought, from, north, africa, by, al, mansur, and, his, children, abd, al, malik, and, sanchuelo, 198, it, was, said, that, sanchuelo, ordered, anyone, attending, his, court, to, wear, berber, turbans, which, roger, collins, suggests, may, not, have, been, true, but, shows, that, hostile, anti, berber, propaganda, was, being, used, to, discredit, the, sons, of, al, mansur, in, 1009, sanchuelo, had, himself, proclaimed, hisham, ii, s, successor, and, then, went, on, military, campaign, however, while, he, was, away, a, revolt, took, place, sanchuelo, s, palace, was, sacked, and, his, support, fell, away, as, he, marched, back, to, cordoba, his, own, berber, mercenaries, abandoned, him, 197, 198, knowing, the, strength, of, ill, feeling, against, them, in, cordoba, they, thought, sanchuelo, would, be, unable, to, protect, them, and, so, they, went, elsewhere, in, order, to, survive, and, secure, their, own, interests, 198, sanchuelo, was, left, with, only, a, few, followers, and, was, captured, and, killed, in, 1009, hisham, ii, abdicated, and, was, succeeded, by, muhammad, ii, al, mahdi, having, abandoned, sanchuelo, the, berbers, who, had, formed, his, army, turned, to, support, another, ambitious, umayyad, sulayman, they, obtained, logistical, support, from, count, sancho, garcia, of, castile, marching, on, cordoba, they, defeated, saqaliba, general, wadih, and, forced, muhammad, ii, al, mahdi, to, flee, to, toledo, they, then, installed, sulayman, as, caliph, and, based, themselves, in, the, madinat, al, zahra, to, avoid, friction, with, the, local, population, 198, 199, wadih, and, al, mahdi, formed, an, alliance, with, the, counts, of, barcelona, and, urgell, and, marched, back, on, cordoba, they, defeated, sulayman, and, the, berber, forces, in, a, battle, near, cordoba, in, 1010, to, avoid, being, destroyed, the, berbers, fled, towards, algeciras, 199, al, mahdi, swore, to, exterminate, the, berbers, and, pursued, them, however, he, was, defeated, in, battle, near, marbella, with, wadih, he, fled, back, to, cordoba, while, his, catalan, allies, went, home, the, berbers, turned, around, and, besieged, cordoba, deciding, that, he, was, about, to, lose, wadih, overthrew, al, mahdi, and, sent, his, head, to, the, berbers, replacing, him, with, hisham, ii, 199, however, the, berbers, did, not, end, the, siege, they, methodically, destroyed, cordoba, s, suburbs, pinning, the, inhabitants, inside, the, old, roman, walls, and, destroying, the, madinat, al, zahra, wadih, s, allies, killed, him, and, the, cordoba, garrison, surrendered, with, the, expectation, of, amnesty, however, a, massacre, ensued, in, which, the, berbers, took, revenge, for, many, personal, and, collective, injuries, and, permanently, settled, several, feuds, in, the, process, 200, the, berbers, made, sulayman, caliph, once, again, ibn, idhari, said, that, the, installation, of, sulayman, in, 1013, was, the, moment, when, the, rule, of, the, berbers, began, in, cordoba, and, that, of, the, umayyads, ended, after, it, had, existed, for, two, hundred, and, sixty, eight, years, and, forty, three, days, 200, during, the, taifa, era, the, petty, kings, came, from, a, variety, of, ethnic, groups, some, for, instance, the, zirid, kings, of, granada, were, of, berber, origin, the, taifa, period, ended, when, a, berber, dynasty, the, moroccan, almoravids, took, over, al, andalus, they, were, succeeded, by, the, almohad, dynasty, of, morocco, during, which, time, al, andalus, flourished, after, the, fall, of, cordoba, in, 1013, the, saqaliba, fled, from, the, city, to, secure, their, own, fiefdoms, one, group, of, saqaliba, seized, orihuela, from, its, berber, garrison, and, took, control, of, the, entire, region, 201, among, the, berbers, who, were, brought, to, al, andalus, by, al, mansur, were, the, zirid, family, of, sanhaja, berbers, after, the, fall, of, cordoba, the, zirids, took, over, granada, in, 1013, forming, the, zirid, kingdom, of, granada, the, saqaliba, khayran, with, his, own, umayyad, figurehead, abd, ar, rahman, iv, al, murtada, attempted, to, seize, granada, from, the, zirids, in, 1018, but, failed, khayran, then, executed, abd, ar, rahman, iv, khayran, s, son, zuhayr, also, made, war, on, the, zirid, kingdom, of, granada, but, was, killed, in, 1038, 202, in, cordoba, conflicts, continued, between, the, berber, rulers, and, those, of, the, citizenry, who, saw, themselves, as, arab, 202, after, being, installed, as, caliph, with, berber, support, sulayman, was, pressured, into, distributing, southern, provinces, to, his, berber, allies, the, sanhaja, departed, from, cordoba, at, this, time, the, zenata, berber, hammudids, received, the, important, districts, of, ceuta, and, algeciras, the, hammudids, claimed, a, family, relation, to, the, idrisids, and, thus, traced, their, ancestry, to, the, caliph, ali, in, 1016, they, rebelled, in, ceuta, claiming, to, be, supporting, the, restoration, of, hisham, ii, they, took, control, of, m, laga, then, marched, on, cordoba, taking, it, and, executing, sulayman, and, his, family, ali, ibn, hammud, al, nasir, declared, himself, caliph, a, position, he, held, for, two, years, 203, for, some, years, hammudids, and, umayyads, fought, one, another, and, the, caliphate, passed, between, them, several, times, hammudids, also, fought, among, themselves, the, last, hammudid, caliph, reigned, until, 1027, the, hammudids, were, then, expelled, from, cordoba, where, there, was, still, a, great, deal, of, anti, berber, sentiment, the, hammudids, remained, in, m, laga, until, expelled, by, the, zirids, in, 1056, 203, the, zirids, of, granada, controlled, m, laga, until, 1073, after, which, separate, zirid, kings, retained, control, over, the, taifas, of, granada, and, malaga, until, the, almoravid, conquest, during, the, taifa, period, the, aftasid, dynasty, based, in, badajoz, controlled, a, large, territory, centered, on, the, guadiana, river, valley, the, area, of, aftasid, control, was, very, large, stretching, from, the, sierra, morena, and, the, taifas, of, m, rtola, and, silves, in, the, south, to, the, campo, de, calatrava, in, the, west, the, montes, de, toledo, in, the, northwest, and, nearly, as, far, as, oporto, in, the, northeast, according, to, bernard, reilly, 13, during, the, taifa, period, genealogy, continued, to, be, an, obsession, of, the, upper, classes, in, al, andalus, most, wanted, to, trace, their, lineage, back, to, the, syrian, and, yemeni, arabs, who, accompanied, the, invasion, in, contrast, tracing, descent, from, the, berbers, who, came, with, the, same, invasion, was, to, be, stigmatized, as, of, inferior, birth, 13, reilly, notes, however, that, in, practice, the, two, groups, had, by, the, 11th, century, become, almost, indistinguishable, both, groups, gradually, ceased, to, be, distinguishable, parts, of, the, muslim, population, except, when, one, of, them, actually, ruled, a, taifa, in, which, case, his, low, origins, were, well, publicized, by, his, rivals, nevertheless, distinctions, between, arab, berber, and, slave, were, not, the, stuff, of, serious, politics, either, within, or, between, the, taifas, it, was, the, individual, family, that, was, the, unit, of, political, activity, 13, the, berber, that, arrived, towards, the, end, of, the, caliphate, as, mercenary, forces, says, reilly, amounted, to, only, about, 20, thousand, people, in, a, total, al, andalusi, population, of, six, million, their, high, visibility, was, due, to, their, foundation, of, taifa, dynasties, rather, than, large, numbers, 13, in, the, power, hierarchy, berbers, were, situated, between, the, arabic, aristocracy, and, the, muladi, populace, ethnic, rivalry, was, one, of, the, most, important, factors, driving, andalusi, politics, berbers, made, up, as, much, as, 20, of, the, population, of, the, occupied, territory, during, the, taifa, period, the, almoravid, empire, developed, in, northwest, africa, whose, core, was, formed, by, the, lamtuna, branch, of, the, sanhaja, berber, 99, in, the, mid, 11th, century, they, allied, with, the, guddala, and, massufa, berber, at, that, time, the, almoravid, leader, yahya, ibn, ibrahim, went, on, a, hajj, on, his, way, back, he, met, malikite, preachers, in, kairouan, and, invited, them, to, his, land, malikite, disciple, abd, allah, ibn, yasin, accepted, the, invitation, traveling, to, morocco, he, established, a, military, monastery, or, ribat, where, he, trained, a, highly, motivated, and, disciplined, fighting, force, in, 1054, and, 1055, employing, these, specially, trained, forces, almoravid, leader, yahya, ibn, umar, defeated, the, kingdom, of, ghana, and, the, zenata, berber, after, yahya, ibn, umar, died, his, brother, abu, bakr, ibn, umar, pursued, an, almoravid, expansion,

hammudids, lost, control, of, their, iberian, possessions, but, retained, a, small, taifa, kingdom, based, in, ceuta, in, 1083, yusuf, ibn, tashufin, conquered, ceuta, in, the, same, year, al, mutamid, king, of, the, taifa, of, seville, traveled, to, morocco, to, appeal, to, yusuf, for, help, against, king, alfonso, vi, of, castile, earlier, in, 1079, the, king, of, badajoz, al, mutawakkil, had, appealed, to, yusuf, for, help, against, alfonso, after, the, fall, of, toledo, to, alfonso, vi, in, 1085, al, mutamid, appealed, again, to, yusuf, this, time, financed, by, the, taifa, kings, of, iberia, yusuf, crossed, to, al, andalus, and, took, direct, personal, control, of, algeciras, in, 1086, 102, 103, the, kabylians, were, independent, of, outside, control, during, the, period, of,

to, in, the, spanish, historiography, as, reino, de, labes, sometimes, more, commonly, referred, to, by, its, ruling, family, the, mokrani, in, berber, at, muqran, arabic, ouled, moqrane, its,

wilaya, iii, being, as, it, was, at, the, centre, of, the, anti, colonial, struggle, from, the, moment, of, algerian, independence, tensions, developed, between, kabyle, leaders, and, the, central, government, soon, after, gaining, independence, in, the, middle, of, the, twentieth, century, the, countries, of, north, africa, established, arabic, as, their, official, language, replacing, french, spanish, and, italian, although, the, shift, from, european, colonial, languages, to, arabic, for, official, purposes, continues, even, to, this, day, as, a, result, most, berbers, had, to, study, and, know, arabic, and, had, no, opportunities, until, the, twenty, first, century, to, use, their, mother, tongue, at, school, or, university, this, may, have, accelerated, the, existing, process, of, arabization, of, berbers, especially, in, already, bilingual, areas, such, as, among, the, chaouis, of, algeria, tamazight, is, now, taught, in, aur, s, since, the, march, led, by, salim, yezza, in, 2004, while, berberism, had, its, roots, before, the, independence, of, these, countries, it, was, limited, to, the, berber, elite, it, only, began, to, succeed, among, the, greater, populace, when, north, african, states, replaced, their, european, colonial, languages, with, arabic, and, identified, exclusively, as, arabian, nations, downplaying, or, ignoring, the, existence, and, the, social, specificity, of, berbers, however, berberism, s, distribution, remains, uneven, in, response, to, its, demands, morocco, and, algeria, have, both, modified, their, policies, with, algeria, redefining, itself, constitutionally, as, an, arab, berber, muslim, nation, there, is, an, identity, related, debate, about, the, persecution, of, berbers, by, the, arab, dominated, regimes, of, north, africa, through, both, pan, arabism, and, islamism, their, issue, of, identity, is, due, to, the, pan, arabist, ideology, of, former, egyptian, president, gamal, abdel, nasser, some, activists, have, claimed, that, t, is, time, long, past, overdue, to, confront, the, racist, arabization, of, the, amazigh, lands, the, black, spring, was, a, series, of, violent, disturbances, and, political, demonstrations, by, kabyle, activists, in, the, kabylie, region, of, algeria, in, 2001, in, the, 2011, libyan, civil, war, berbers, in, the, nafusa, mountains, were, quick, to, revolt, against, the, gaddafi, regime, the, mountains, became, a, stronghold, of, the, rebel, movement, and, were, a, focal, point, of, the, conflict, with, much, fighting, occurring, between, rebels, and, loyalists, for, control, of, the, region, the, tuareg, rebellion, of, 2012, was, waged, against, the, malian, government, by, rebels, with, the, goal, of, attaining, independence, for, the, northern, region, of, mali, known, as, azawad, since, late, 2016, massive, riots, have, spread, across, moroccan, berber, communities, in, the, rif, region, another, escalation, took, place, in, may, 2017, in, morocco, after, the, constitutional, reforms, of, 2011, berber, has, become, an, official, language, and, is, now, taught, as, a, compulsory, language, in, all, schools, regardless, of, the, area, or, the, ethnicity, in, 2016, algeria, followed, suit, and, changed, the, status, of, berber, from, national, to, official, language, although, berberists, who, openly, show, their, political, orientations, rarely, reach, high, positions, berbers, have, reached, high, positions, in, the, social, and, political, hierarchies, across, the, maghreb, examples, are, the, former, president, of, algeria, liamine, zeroual, the, former, prime, minister, of, morocco, driss, jettou, and, khalida, toumi, a, feminist, and, berberist, militant, who, has, been, nominated, as, head, of, the, ministry, of, communication, in, algeria, the, arabization, of, the, indigenous, berber, populations, was, a, result, of, the, centuries, long, arab, migrations, to, the, maghreb, which, began, since, the, 7th, century, in, addition, to, changing, the, population, s, demographics, the, early, wave, of, migration, prior, to, the, 11th, century, contributed, to, the, berber, adoption, of, arab, culture, furthermore, the, arabic, language, spread, during, this, period, and, drove, latin, into, extinction, in, the, cities, the, arabization, took, place, around, arab, centres, through, the, influence, of, arabs, in, the, cities, and, rural, areas, surrounding, them, the, migration, of, banu, hilal, and, banu, sulaym, in, the, 11th, century, had, a, much, greater, influence, on, the, process, of, arabization, of, the, population, it, played, a, major, role, in, spreading, bedouin, arabic, to, rural, areas, such, as, the, countryside, and, steppes, and, as, far, as, the, southern, areas, near, the, sahara, it, also, heavily, transformed, the, culture, in, the, maghreb, into, arab, culture, and, spread, nomadism, in, areas, where, agriculture, was, previously, dominant, these, bedouin, tribes, accelerated, and, deepened, the, arabization, process, since, the, berber, population, was, gradually, assimilated, by, the, newcomers, and, had, to, share, with, them, pastures, and, seasonal, migration, paths, by, around, the, 15th, century, the, region, of, modern, day, tunisia, had, already, been, almost, completely, arabized, as, arab, nomads, spread, the, territories, of, the, local, berber, tribes, were, moved, and, shrank, the, zenata, were, pushed, to, the, west, and, the, kabyles, were, pushed, to, the, north, the, berbers, took, refuge, in, the, mountains, whereas, the, plains, were, arabized, currently, most, arabized, berbers, identify, as, berber, although, the, prominence, of, arab, influences, has, fully, assimilated, them, into, the, arab, cultural, sphere, ethnically, berbers, comprise, a, minority, population, in, the, maghreb, berbers, comprise, 15, to, 25, the, population, of, algeria, 10, of, libya, 31, to, 35, of, morocco, and, 1, of, tunisia, berber, language, speakers, in, the, maghreb, comprise, 30, to, 40, of, the, moroccan, population, and, 15, to, 35, of, the, algerian, population, with, smaller, communities, in, libya, and, very, small, groups, in, tunisia, egypt, and, mauritania, berber, languages, in, total, are, spoken, by, around, 14, million, to, 16, million, people, in, africa, prominent, berber, ethnic, groups, include, the, kabyles, from, kabylia, a, historical, autonomous, region, of, northern, algeria, who, number, about, six, million, and, have, kept, to, a, large, degree, their, original, language, and, society, and, the, shilha, or, chleuh, in, high, and, anti, atlas, and, sous, valley, of, morocco, who, number, about, eight, million, other, groups, include, the, riffians, of, northern, morocco, the, chaoui, people, of, eastern, algeria, the, chenouas, in, western, algeria, and, the, nafusis, of, the, nafusa, mountains, outside, the, maghreb, the, tuareg, in, mali, early, settlement, near, the, old, imperial, capital, of, timbuktu, niger, and, burkina, faso, number, some, 850, 000, 1, 620, 000, and, 50, 000, respectively, tuaregs, are, a, berber, ethnic, group, with, a, traditionally, nomadic, pastoralist, lifestyle, and, are, the, principal, inhabitants, of, the, vast, sahara, desert, genetically, the, berbers, form, the, principal, indigenous, ancestry, in, the, region, haplogroup, e1b1b, is, the, most, frequent, among, maghrebi, groups, especially, the, downstream, lineage, of, e1b1b1b1a, which, is, typical, of, the, indigenous, berbers, of, north, west, africa, on, the, other, hand, haplogroup, j1, is, the, second, most, frequent, among, maghrebi, groups, and, is, more, indicative, of, middle, east, origins, and, has, its, highest, distribution, among, populations, in, the, southern, arabian, peninsula, e1b1b1b, accounts, for, 45, of, north, africans, while, haplogroup, j1, m267, accounts, for, 30, of, north, africans, and, has, spread, from, arabia, the, semitic, speaking, presence, in, the, maghreb, is, mainly, due, to, the, migratory, movements, of, phoenicians, in, the, 3rd, century, bc, and, large, scale, migrations, of, arab, bedouin, tribes, in, the, 11th, century, ad, such, as, banu, hilal, and, banu, sulaym, as, well, as, other, waves, that, occurred, during, the, arab, migrations, to, the, maghreb, c, 7th, century, 17th, century, the, results, of, a, study, from, 2017, suggest, that, these, arab, migrations, to, the, maghreb, were, mainly, a, demographic, process, that, heavily, implied, gene, flow, and, remodeled, the, genetic, structure, of, the, maghreb, according, to, a, 2004, estimate, there, were, about, 2, 2, million, berber, immigrants, in, europe, especially, the, riffians, in, belgium, the, netherlands, and, france, and, algerians, of, kabyles, and, chaouis, heritage, in, france, since, the, 1970s, 209, a, political, movement, initially, led, by, the, kabyles, of, algeria, has, developed, among, various, parts, of, the, berber, populations, of, north, africa, to, promote, a, collective, amazigh, ethnic, identity, it, is, variously, referred, to, as, amazighism, berberism, the, berber, identity, movement, or, the, berber, culture, movement, the, movement, does, not, have, a, specific, organization, and, cuts, across, both, modern, national, boundaries, and, traditional, tribal, divisions, it, is, generally, consistent, in, its, demands, which, include, greater, linguistic, rights, for, berber, languages, and, greater, official, and, social, recognition, of, amazigh, culture, these, berberists, also, aimed, to, counter, the, image, that, berbers, were, a, mere, collection, of, disparate, tribes, speaking, mutually, incomprehensible, languages, they, did, this, by, introducing, imazighen, as, a, collective, term, of, self, referral, and, claimed, that, the, various, berber, languages, once, constituted, a, single, language, the, political, outcomes, have, been, different, in, each, country, of, the, maghreb, and, are, shaped, by, other, factors, such, as, geography, and, socioeconomic, circumstances, in, algeria, the, politics, of, the, movement, were, focused, in, kabylie, were, more, overtly, political, and, have, sometimes, been, confrontational, in, morocco, where, amazigh, populations, are, spread, across, a, wider, area, the, movement, has, been, less, overtly, political, and, confrontational, 213, in, the, 1990s, both, states, made, concessions, to, this, movement, or, attempted, to, ally, itself, with, it, partly, in, response, to, the, challenge, of, other, political, forces, such, as, islamism, 214, over, the, past, few, decades, political, tensions, have, arisen, between, some, berber, groups, especially, the, kabyles, and, rifians, and, north, african, governments, partly, over, linguistic, and, social, issues, for, example, in, morocco, algeria, tunisia, and, libya, giving, children, berber, names, was, banned, in, morocco, the, arabic, language, and, arab, culture, occupied, a, superior, position, in, official, and, social, domains, the, arabist, ideology, was, popular, among, moroccan, society, as, well, as, within, bureaucratic, cadres, and, the, political, parties, the, regime, of, muammar, gaddafi, in, libya, also, banned, the, teaching, of, berber, languages, and, in, a, 2008, leaked, diplomatic, cable, the, libyan, leader, warned, berber, minorities, you, can, call, yourselves, whatever, you, want, inside, your, homes, berbers, children, of, satan, whatever, but, you, are, only, libyans, when, you, leave, your, homes, he, denied, the, existence, of, berbers, as, a, separate, ethnicity, and, called, berbers, a, product, of, colonialism, created, by, the, west, to, divide, libya, as, a, result, of, the, persecution, suffered, under, gaddafi, s, rule, many, berbers, joined, the, libyan, opposition, in, the, 2011, libyan, civil, war, in, contrast, many, berber, students, in, morocco, supported, nasserism, and, arabism, rather, than, berberism, many, educated, berbers, were, attracted, to, the, leftist, national, union, of, popular, forces, rather, than, the, berber, based, popular, movement, the, berber, languages, form, a, branch, of, the, afroasiatic, language, family, a, large, family, that, also, includes, semitic, languages, like, arabic, and, the, ancient, egyptian, language, most, berbers, speak, arabic, and, french, tamazight, is, a, generic, name, for, all, of, the, berber, languages, which, consist, of, many, closely, related, varieties, and, dialects, among, these, berber, languages, are, riffian, zuwara, kabyle, shilha, siwi, zenaga, sanhaja, tazayit, central, atlas, tamazight, tum, abt, mozabite, nafusi, and, tamasheq, as, well, as, the, ancient, guanche, language, most, berber, languages, have, a, high, percentage, of, borrowing, and, influence, from, the, arabic, language, as, well, as, from, other, languages, for, example, arabic, loanwords, represent, 35, to, 46, of, the, total, vocabulary, of, the, kabyle, language, and, represent, 51, 7, of, the, total, vocabulary, of, tarifit, the, least, influenced, are, the, tuareg, languages, almost, all, berber, languages, took, from, arabic, the, pharyngeal, fricatives, and, the, nongeminated, uvular, stop, q, and, the, voiceless, pharyngealized, consonant, in, turn, berber, languages, have, influenced, local, dialects, of, arabic, although, maghrebi, arabic, has, a, predominantly, semitic, and, arabic, vocabulary, it, contains, a, few, berber, loanwords, which, represent, 2, 3, of, the, vocabulary, of, libyan, arabic, 8, 9, of, algerian, arabic, and, tunisian, arabic, and, 10, 15, of, moroccan, arabic, berber, languages, in, total, are, spoken, by, around, 14, million, to, 16, million, people, in, africa, see, population, estimation, these, berber, speakers, are, mainly, concentrated, in, morocco, and, algeria, followed, by, mali, niger, and, libya, smaller, berber, speaking, communities, are, also, found, as, far, east, as, egypt, with, a, southwestern, limit, today, at, burkina, faso, the, berber, identity, encompasses, language, religion, and, ethnicity, and, is, rooted, in, the, entire, history, and, geography, of, north, africa, berbers, are, not, an, entirely, homogeneous, ethnicity, and, they, include, a, range, of, societies, ancestries, and, lifestyles, the, unifying, forces, for, the, berber, people, may, be, their, shared, language, or, a, collective, identification, with, berber, heritage, and, history, as, a, legacy, of, the, spread, of, islam, the, berbers, are, now, mostly, sunni, muslim, however, the, mozabite, berbers, of, the, m, zab, valley, in, the, town, of, gharda, a, in, algeria, and, some, libyan, berbers, in, the, nafusa, mountains, and, zuwara, are, primarily, adherents, of, ibadi, islam, in, antiquity, before, the, arrival, of, abrahamic, faiths, into, north, africa, the, berber, people, adhered, to, the, traditional, berber, religion, this, traditional, religion, emphasized, ancestor, veneration, polytheism, and, animism, many, ancient, berber, beliefs, were, developed, locally, whereas, others, were, influenced, over, time, through, contact, with, other, traditional, african, religions, such, as, the, ancient, egyptian, religion, or, borrowed, during, antiquity, from, the, punic, religion, judaism, iberian, mythology, and, the, hellenistic, religion, the, most, recent, influence, came, from, islam, and, pre, islamic, arab, religion, during, the, medieval, period, some, of, the, ancient, berber, beliefs, still, subtly, exist, today, within, the, berber, popular, culture, and, tradition, until, the, 1960s, there, was, also, a, significant, jewish, berber, minority, in, morocco, but, emigration, mostly, to, israel, and, france, dramatically, reduced, their, number, to, only, a, few, hundred, individuals, following, christian, missions, the, kabyle, community, in, algeria, has, a, recently, constituted, christian, minority, both, protestant, and, roman, catholic, and, a, 2015, study, estimates, that, 380, 000, muslim, algerians, have, converted, to, christianity, in, algeria, there, are, berbers, among, the, 8, 000, 40, 000, moroccans, who, have, converted, to, christianity, in, the, last, decades, some, of, whom, explain, their, conversion, as, an, attempt, to, go, back, to, their, christian, sources, the, international, religious, freedom, report, for, 2007, estimates, that, thousands, of, tunisian, berber, muslims, have, converted, to, christianity, some, of, the, earliest, evidence, of, original, amazigh, culture, in, north, africa, has, been, found, in, the, highlands, of, the, sahara, and, dates, from, the, second, millennium, bc, when, the, region, was, much, less, arid, than, it, is, today, and, when, the, amazigh, population, was, most, likely, in, the, process, of, spreading, across, north, africa, 15, 22, numerous, archaeological, sites, associated, with, the, garamantes, have, been, found, in, the, fezzan, in, present, day, libya, attesting, to, the, existence, of, small, villages, towns, and, tombs, at, least, one, settlement, dates, from, as, early, as, 1000, bc, the, structures, were, initially, built, in, dry, stone, but, around, the, middle, of, the, millennium, c, 500, bc, they, began, to, be, built, with, mudbrick, instead, 23, by, the, second, century, ad, there, is, evidence, of, large, villas, and, more, sophisticated, tombs, associated, with, the, aristocracy, of, this, society, in, particular, at, germa, 24, further, west, the, kingdom, of, numidia, was, contemporary, with, the, phoenician, civilization, of, carthage, and, the, roman, republic, among, other, things, the, numidians, have, left, thousands, of, pre, christian, tombs, the, oldest, of, these, is, medracen, in, present, day, algeria, believed, to, date, from, the, time, of, masinissa, 202, 148, bc, possibly, influenced, by, greek, architecture, further, east, or, built, with, the, help, of, greek, craftsmen, the, tomb, consists, of, a, large, tumulus, constructed, in, well, cut, ashlar, masonry, and, featuring, sixty, doric, columns, and, an, egyptian, style, cornice, 27, 29, another, famous, example, is, the, tomb, of, the, christian, woman, in, western, algeria, this, structure, consists, of, columns, a, dome, and, spiral, pathways, that, lead, to, a, single, chamber, a, number, of, tower, tombs, from, the, numidian, period, can, also, be, found, in, sites, from, algeria, to, libya, despite, their, wide, geographic, range, they, often, share, a, similar, style, a, three, story, structure, topped, by, a, convex, pyramid, they, may, have, initially, been, inspired, by, greek, monuments, but, they, constitute, an, original, type, of, structure, associated, with, numidian, culture, examples, of, these, are, found, at, siga, soumaa, d, el, khroub, dougga, and, sabratha, 29, 31, mediterranean, empires, of, carthage, and, rome, left, their, mark, in, the, material, culture, of, north, africa, as, well, phoenician, and, punic, carthaginian, remains, can, be, found, at, carthage, itself, and, at, lixus, numerous, remains, of, roman, architecture, can, be, found, across, the, region, such, as, the, amphitheatre, of, el, jem, and, the, archaeological, sites, of, sabratha, timgad, and, volubilis, among, others, after, the, arab, muslim, conquest, of, the, maghreb, in, the, 7th, and, early, 8th, centuries, islamic, architecture, developed, in, the, region, various, dynasties, either, based, in, north, africa, or, beyond, it, contributed, to, the, architecture, of, the, region, including, the, aghlabids, the, fatimids, and, the, umayyads, of, cordoba, in, addition, to, the, general, moorish, style, prevalent, in, north, africa, during, the, islamic, period, some, architectural, styles, and, structures, in, north, africa, are, distinctively, associated, with, areas, that, have, maintained, strong, berber, populations, and, cultures, including, but, not, limited, to, the, atlas, mountain, regions, of, morocco, the, aur, s, and, m, zab, regions, of, algeria, and, southern, tunisia, they, do, not, form, one, single, architectural, style, but, rather, a, diverse, variety, of, local, vernacular, styles, berber, ruling, dynasties, also, contributed, to, the, formation, and, patronage, of, western, islamic, art, and, architecture, through, their, political, domination, of, the, region, between, the, 11th, and, 16th, centuries, during, the, rule, of, the, almoravids, almohads, marinids, and, hafsids, among, others, in, morocco, the, largely, berber, inhabited, rural, valleys, and, oases, of, the, atlas, and, the, south, are, marked, by, numerous, kasbahs, fortresses, and, ksour, fortified, villages, typically, flat, roofed, structures, made, of, rammed, earth, and, decorated, with, local, geometric, motifs, as, with, the, famous, example, of, ait, benhaddou, likewise, southern, tunisia, is, dotted, with, hilltop, ksour, and, multi, story, fortified, granaries, ghorfa, such, as, the, examples, in, medenine, and, ksar, ouled, soltane, which, are, typically, built, with, loose, stone, bound, by, a, mortar, of, clay, fortified, granaries, also, exist, in, the, aures, region, of, algeria, or, in, the, form, of, agadir, s, of, which, numerous, examples, can, be, found, in, morocco, the, island, of, jerba, in, tunisia, traditionally, dominated, by, ibadi, berbers, has, a, traditional, style, of, mosque, architecture, that, consists, of, low, lying, structures, built, in, stone, and, covered, in, whitewash, their, prayer, halls, are, domed, and, they, have, short, often, round, minarets, the, mosques, are, often, described, as, fortified, mosques, because, the, island, s, flat, topography, made, it, vulnerable, to, attacks, and, as, a, result, the, mosques, were, designed, in, part, to, act, as, watch, posts, along, the, coast, or, in, the, countryside, the, m, zab, region, of, algeria, e, g, gharda, a, also, has, distinctive, mosques, and, houses, that, are, completely, whitewashed, but, built, in, rammed, earth, the, structures, here, also, make, frequent, use, of, domes, and, barrel, vaults, unlike, in, jerba, the, distinctive, minarets, in, this, region, are, tall, and, have, a, square, base, tapering, towards, the, end, and, crowned, with, horn, like, corners, the, traditional, social, structure, of, the, berbers, has, been, tribal, a, leader, is, appointed, to, command, the, tribe, in, the, middle, ages, many, women, had, the, power, to, govern, such, as, dihya, and, tazoughert, fatma, in, the, aur, s, mountains, tin, hinan, in, the, hoggar, chemci, in, a, t, iraten, fatma, tazoughert, in, the, aur, s, lalla, fatma, n, soumer, was, a, berber, woman, in, kabylie, who, fought, against, the, french, the, majority, of, berber, tribes, currently, have, men, as, heads, of, the, tribe, in, algeria, the, el, kseur, platform, in, kabylie, gives, tribes, the, right, to, fine, criminal, offenders, in, areas, of, chaoui, tribal, leaders, enact, sanctions, against, criminals, the, tuareg, have, a, king, who, decides, the, fate, of, the, tribe, and, is, known, as, amenokal, it, is, a, very, hierarchical, society, the, mozabites, are, governed, by, the, spiritual, leaders, of, ibadism, and, lead, communal, lives, during, the, crisis, of, berriane, between, the, maliki, and, ibadite, movements, the, heads, of, each, tribe, began, talks, to, end, the, crisis, and, resolved, the, problem, in, marriages, the, man, usually, selects, the, woman, and, depending, on, the, tribe, the, family, often, makes, the, decision, in, contrast, in, the, tuareg, culture, the,
