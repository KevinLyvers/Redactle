of, the, equitable, owners, trustees, must, provide, regular, accountings, of, trust, income, and, expenditures, a, court, of, competent, jurisdiction, can, remove, a, trustee, who, breaches, their, duty, some, breaches, can, be, charged, and, tried, as, criminal, offenses, a, trustee, can, be, a, natural, person, business, entity, or, public, body, a, trust, in, the, us, may, be, subject, to, federal, and, state, taxation, the, trust, is, governed, by, the, terms, under, which, it, was, created, in, most, jurisdictions, this, requires, a, contractual, trust, agreement, or, deed, it, is, possible, for, a, single, individual, to, assume, the, role, of, more, than, one, of, these, parties, and, for, multiple, individuals, to, share, a, single, role, for, example, in, a, living, trust, it, is, common, for, the, grantor, to, be, both, a, trustee, and, a, lifetime, beneficiary, while, naming, other, contingent, beneficiaries, trusts, have, existed, since, roman, times, and, become, one, of, the, most, important, innovations, in, property, law, specific, aspects, of, trust, law, vary, in, different, jurisdictions, some, u, s, states, are, adapting, the, uniform, trust, code, to, codify, and, harmonize, their, trust, laws, but, state, specific, variations, still, remain, an, owner, placing, property, into, trust, turns, over, part, of, their, bundle, of, rights, to, the, trustee, separating, the, property, s, legal, ownership, and, control, from, its, equitable, ownership, and, benefits, this, may, be, done, for, tax, reasons, or, to, control, the, property, and, its, benefits, if, the, settlor, is, absent, incapacitated, or, deceased, testamentary, trusts, may, be, created, in, wills, defining, how, money, and, property, will, be, handled, for, children, or, other, beneficiaries, while, the, trustee, is, given, legal, title, to, the, trust, property, in, accepting, title, the, trustee, owes, a, number, of, fiduciary, duties, to, the, beneficiaries, the, primary, duties, owed, are, those, of, loyalty, prudence, and, impartiality, trustees, may, be, held, to, a, high, standard, of, care, in, their, dealings, to, enforce, their, behavior, to, ensure, beneficiaries, receive, their, due, trustees, are, subject, to, ancillary, duties, in, support, of, the, primary, duties, including, openness, transparency, recordkeeping, accounting, and, disclosure, a, trustee, has, a, duty, to, know, understand, and, abide, by, the, terms, of, the, trust, and, relevant, law, the, trustee, may, be, compensated, and, have, expenses, reimbursed, but, otherwise, turn, over, all, profits, from, the, trust, and, neither, endebt, nor, riskily, speculate, on, the, assets, without, the, written, clear, permission, of, all, adult, beneficiaries, there, are, strong, restrictions, regarding, a, trustee, with, a, conflict, of, interest, courts, can, reverse, a, trustee, s, actions, order, profits, returned, and, impose, other, sanctions, if, they, find, a, trustee, has, failed, in, their, duties, such, a, failure, is, a, civil, breach, of, trust, and, can, leave, a, neglectful, or, dishonest, trustee, with, severe, liabilities, it, is, advisable, for, settlors, and, trustees, to, seek, legal, advice, before, entering, into, or, creating, a, trust, agreement, and, trustees, must, take, care, in, acting, or, omitting, to, act, to, avoid, unlawful, mistakes, roman, law, had, a, well, developed, concept, of, the, trust, fideicommissum, in, terms, of, testamentary, trusts, created, by, wills, but, never, developed, the, concept, of, the, inter, vivos, living, trusts, which, apply, while, the, creator, lives, this, was, created, by, later, common, law, jurisdictions, personal, trust, law, developed, in, england, at, the, time, of, the, crusades, during, the, 12th, and, 13th, centuries, in, medieval, english, trust, law, the, settlor, was, known, as, the, feoffor, to, uses, while, the, trustee, was, known, as, the, feoffee, to, uses, and, the, beneficiary, was, known, as, the, cestui, que, use, or, cestui, que, trust, at, the, time, land, ownership, in, england, was, based, on, the, feudal, system, when, a, landowner, left, england, to, fight, in, the, crusades, he, conveyed, ownership, of, his, lands, in, his, absence, to, manage, the, estate, and, pay, and, receive, feudal, dues, on, the, understanding, that, the, ownership, would, be, conveyed, back, on, his, return, however, crusaders, often, encountered, refusal, to, hand, over, the, property, upon, their, return, english, common, law, did, not, recognize, his, claim, as, far, as, the, king, s, courts, were, concerned, the, land, belonged, to, the, trustee, who, was, under, no, obligation, to, return, it, the, crusader, had, no, legal, claim, the, disgruntled, crusader, would, then, petition, the, king, who, would, refer, the, matter, to, his, lord, chancellor, the, lord, chancellor, could, decide, a, case, according, to, his, conscience, at, this, time, the, principle, of, equity, was, born, in, english, law, however, the, original, notion, of, equity, goes, all, the, way, back, to, aristotle, and, is, found, in, book, v, chapter, 10, of, his, ethics, indeed, the, universities, of, the, 13th, century, often, wrote, commentaries, on, aristotle, s, works, and, it, was, these, universities, that, gave, rise, to, the, lawyers, of, the, time, the, lord, chancellor, would, consider, it, unconscionable, that, the, legal, owner, could, go, back, on, his, word, and, deny, the, claims, of, the, crusader, the, true, owner, therefore, he, would, find, in, favour, of, the, returning, crusader, over, time, it, became, known, that, the, lord, chancellor, s, court, the, court, of, chancery, would, continually, recognize, the, claim, of, a, returning, crusader, the, legal, owner, would, hold, the, land, for, the, benefit, of, the, original, owner, and, would, be, compelled, to, convey, it, back, to, him, when, requested, the, crusader, was, the, beneficiary, and, the, acquaintance, the, trustee, the, term, use, of, land, was, coined, and, in, time, developed, into, what, we, now, know, as, a, trust, the, trust, is, widely, considered, to, be, the, most, innovative, contribution, of, the, english, legal, system, today, trusts, play, a, significant, role, in, most, common, law, systems, and, their, success, has, led, some, civil, law, jurisdictions, to, incorporate, trusts, into, their, civil, codes, in, cura, ao, for, example, the, trust, was, enacted, into, law, on, 1, january, 2012, however, the, cura, ao, civil, code, only, allows, express, trusts, constituted, by, notarial, instrument, france, has, recently, added, a, similar, roman, law, based, device, to, its, own, law, with, the, fiducie, amended, in, 2009, the, fiducie, unlike, a, trust, is, a, contractual, relationship, trusts, are, widely, used, internationally, especially, in, countries, within, the, english, law, sphere, of, influence, and, whilst, most, civil, law, jurisdictions, do, not, generally, contain, the, concept, of, a, trust, within, their, legal, systems, they, do, recognise, the, concept, under, the, hague, convention, on, the, law, applicable, to, trusts, and, on, their, recognition, partly, only, the, extent, that, they, are, parties, thereto, the, hague, convention, also, regulates, conflict, of, trusts, although, trusts, are, often, associated, with, intrafamily, wealth, transfers, they, have, become, very, important, in, american, capital, markets, particularly, through, pension, funds, in, certain, countries, essentially, always, trusts, and, mutual, funds, often, trusts, property, of, any, sort, may, be, held, in, a, trust, the, uses, of, trusts, are, many, and, varied, for, both, personal, and, commercial, reasons, and, trusts, may, provide, benefits, in, estate, planning, asset, protection, and, taxes, living, trusts, may, be, created, during, a, person, s, life, through, the, drafting, of, a, trust, instrument, or, after, death, in, a, will, in, a, relevant, sense, a, trust, can, be, viewed, as, a, generic, form, of, a, corporation, where, the, settlors, investors, are, also, the, beneficiaries, this, is, particularly, evident, in, the, delaware, business, trust, which, could, theoretically, with, the, language, in, the, governing, instrument, be, organized, as, a, cooperative, corporation, or, a, limited, liability, corporation, 475, 6, although, traditionally, the, massachusetts, business, trust, has, been, commonly, used, in, the, us, one, of, the, most, significant, aspects, of, trusts, is, the, ability, to, partition, and, shield, assets, from, the, trustee, multiple, beneficiaries, and, their, respective, creditors, particularly, the, trustee, s, creditors, making, it, bankruptcy, remote, and, leading, to, its, use, in, pensions, mutual, funds, and, asset, securitization, as, well, protection, of, individual, spendthrifts, through, the, spendthrift, trust, trusts, may, be, created, by, the, expressed, intentions, of, the, settlor, also, known, as, the, founder, express, trusts, or, they, may, be, created, by, operation, of, law, known, as, implied, trusts, an, implied, trust, is, one, created, by, a, court, of, equity, because, of, acts, or, situations, of, the, parties, implied, trusts, are, divided, into, two, categories, resulting, and, constructive, a, resulting, trust, is, implied, by, the, law, to, work, out, the, presumed, intentions, of, the, parties, but, it, does, not, take, into, consideration, their, expressed, intent, a, constructive, trust, is, a, trust, implied, by, law, to, work, out, justice, between, the, parties, regardless, of, their, intentions, common, ways, in, which, a, trust, is, created, include, in, some, jurisdictions, certain, types, of, assets, may, not, be, the, subject, of, a, trust, without, a, written, document, the, formalities, required, of, a, trust, depend, on, the, type, of, trust, in, question, generally, a, private, express, trust, requires, three, elements, to, be, certain, which, together, are, known, as, the, three, certainties, these, elements, were, determined, in, knight, v, knight, to, be, intention, subject, matter, and, objects, the, certainty, of, intention, allows, the, court, to, ascertain, a, settlor, s, true, reason, for, creating, the, trust, the, certainties, of, subject, matter, and, objects, allow, the, court, to, administer, trust, when, the, trustees, fail, to, do, so, the, court, determines, whether, there, is, sufficient, certainty, by, construing, the, words, used, in, the, trust, instrument, these, words, are, construed, objectively, in, their, reasonable, meaning, within, the, context, of, the, entire, instrument, despite, intention, being, integral, to, express, trusts, the, court, will, try, not, to, let, trusts, fail, for, the, lack, of, certainty, a, trust, may, have, multiple, trustees, and, these, trustees, are, the, legal, owners, of, the, trust, s, property, but, have, a, fiduciary, duty, to, beneficiaries, and, various, duties, such, as, a, duty, of, care, and, a, duty, to, inform, if, trustees, do, not, adhere, to, these, duties, they, may, be, removed, through, a, legal, action, the, trustee, may, be, either, a, person, or, a, legal, entity, such, as, a, company, but, typically, the, trust, itself, is, not, a, legal, entity, and, any, litigation, involving, the, trust, must, include, the, trustee, as, a, party, a, trustee, has, many, rights, and, responsibilities, which, vary, based, on, the, jurisdiction, and, trust, instrument, if, a, trust, lacks, a, trustee, a, court, may, appoint, a, trustee, the, trustees, administer, the, affairs, attendant, to, the, trust, the, trust, s, affairs, may, include, prudently, investing, the, assets, of, the, trust, accounting, for, and, reporting, periodically, to, the, beneficiaries, filing, required, tax, returns, and, other, duties, in, some, cases, dependent, upon, the, trust, instrument, the, trustees, must, make, discretionary, decisions, as, to, whether, beneficiaries, should, receive, trust, assets, for, their, benefit, a, trustee, may, be, held, personally, liable, for, problems, although, fiduciary, liability, insurance, similar, to, directors, and, officers, liability, insurance, can, be, purchased, for, example, a, trustee, could, be, liable, if, assets, are, not, properly, invested, in, addition, a, trustee, may, be, liable, to, its, beneficiaries, even, where, the, trust, has, made, a, profit, but, consent, has, not, been, given, however, in, the, united, states, similar, to, directors, and, officers, an, exculpatory, clause, may, minimize, liability, although, this, was, previously, held, to, be, against, public, policy, this, position, has, changed, in, the, united, states, the, uniform, trust, code, provides, for, reasonable, compensation, and, reimbursement, for, trustees, subject, to, review, by, courts, although, trustees, may, be, unpaid, commercial, banks, acting, as, trustees, typically, charge, about, 1, of, assets, under, management, the, beneficiaries, are, beneficial, or, equitable, owners, of, the, trust, property, either, immediately, or, eventually, the, beneficiaries, will, receive, income, from, the, trust, property, or, they, will, receive, the, property, itself, the, extent, of, a, beneficiary, s, interest, depends, on, the, wording, of, the, trust, document, one, beneficiary, may, be, entitled, to, income, for, example, interest, from, a, bank, account, whereas, another, may, be, entitled, to, the, entirety, of, the, trust, property, when, they, attain, the, age, of, twenty, five, years, the, settlor, has, much, discretion, when, creating, the, trust, subject, to, some, limitations, imposed, by, law, the, use, of, trusts, as, a, means, to, inherit, substantial, wealth, may, be, associated, with, some, negative, connotations, some, beneficiaries, who, are, able, to, live, comfortably, from, trust, proceeds, without, having, to, work, a, job, may, be, jokingly, referred, to, as, trust, fund, babies, regardless, of, age, or, trustafarians, common, purposes, for, trusts, include, trusts, go, by, many, different, names, depending, on, the, characteristics, or, the, purpose, of, the, trust, because, trusts, often, have, multiple, characteristics, or, purposes, a, single, trust, might, accurately, be, described, in, several, ways, for, example, a, living, trust, is, often, an, express, trust, which, is, also, a, revocable, trust, and, might, include, an, incentive, trust, and, so, forth, while, trusts, originated, in, england, and, therefore, english, trusts, law, has, had, a, significant, influence, particularly, among, common, law, legal, systems, such, as, those, of, the, commonwealth, or, the, united, states, the, impact, of, trust, law, has, been, wide, and, varied, even, under, common, law, systems, the, basic, notion, of, a, trust, has, been, implemented, in, strikingly, different, ways, trust, law, in, civil, law, jurisdictions, generally, including, continental, europe, only, exists, in, a, limited, number, of, jurisdictions, e, g, cura, ao, liechtenstein, and, sint, maarten, the, trust, may, however, be, recognized, as, an, instrument, of, foreign, law, in, conflict, of, laws, cases, for, example, within, the, brussels, regime, europe, and, the, parties, to, the, hague, trust, convention, tax, avoidance, concerns, have, historically, been, one, of, the, reasons, that, european, countries, with, a, civil, law, system, have, been, reluctant, to, adopt, trusts, cyprus, legislators, enacted, the, cyprus, international, trusts, law, of, 2012, with, an, aim, to, facilitate, the, establishment, of, trusts, by, non, cypriot, residents, the, cyprus, international, trust, is, based, on, common, law, principles, however, the, cyprus, international, trusts, law, of, 2012, introduces, certain, conditions, and, requirements, to, for, the, trust, to, qualify, under, the, same, law, these, conditions, are, in, addition, to, above, the, common, law, principles, of, certainty, must, be, present, the, cyprus, international, trust, law, of, 2012, also, introduces, certain, settlor, powers, which, if, exercised, will, not, invalidate, the, trust, and, or, do, not, need, to, be, inserted, in, the, trust, deed, for, the, settlor, to, exercise, them, the, powers, introduced, are, cyprus, does, not, limit, the, duration, of, an, international, trust, and, it, may, be, formed, for, an, unspecified, duration, in, accordance, with, section, 7, a, cyprus, international, trust, may, be, formed, for, one, or, more, of, the, following, purposes, the, law, includes, specific, confidentiality, obligations, over, the, trustee, the, protector, enforcer, or, any, other, person, to, keep, information, and, details, of, the, trust, confidential, this, right, is, waived, in, the, instances, that, law, requires, the, disclosure, of, such, information, or, if, a, judge, before, which, a, case, is, tried, in, issues, a, judgment, to, such, effect, nevertheless, with, the, changing, times, public, disclosure, of, trusts, is, required, in, cyprus, such, public, disclosures, are, required, for, a, trust, to, be, validly, constituted, it, must, be, presented, to, the, commissioner, of, stamp, duty, and, a, one, time, payment, of, euro, 430, is, made, the, commissioner, does, not, keep, a, copy, of, the, document, the, regulation, of, the, industry, providing, company, and, trust, management, functions, asp, has, also, brought, about, the, requirement, to, disclose, to, the, regulator, the, existence, of, a, cyprus, international, trust, such, obligation, burdens, the, trust, company, and, the, information, disclosed, is, the, following, for, the, avoidance, of, any, doubt, the, regulator, does, not, require, particulars, of, the, settlor, the, beneficiaries, and, details, of, the, trusts, neither, does, the, regulator, store, in, any, way, the, trust, deed, on, the, contrary, they, rely, on, the, regulated, entity, to, collect, store, and, update, this, information, the, prevention, and, suppression, of, money, laundering, and, terrorist, financing, law, of, 2007, 2018, introduced, mandatory, disclosure, requirements, in, respects, to, trusts, generally, known, as, the, cyprus, beneficial, ownership, register, subject, to, this, the, following, information, will, be, required, to, be, mandatory, disclosed, the, actual, implementation, of, this, law, still, remains, to, be, seen, however, the, requirements, above, are, expressly, extracted, from, the, prevention, and, suppression, of, money, laundering, and, terrorist, financing, law, of, 2007, 2018, under, the, foreign, account, tax, compliance, act, fatca, a, trustee, and, or, a, trust, may, be, classified, as, a, foreign, financial, institution, ffi, requiring, registration, with, the, irs, and, disclosure, of, results, on, a, yearly, basis, under, the, common, reporting, standard, decree, a, trust, would, in, most, cases, classify, as, either, a, reporting, financial, institution, fi, or, a, passive, non, financial, entity, passive, nfe, if, the, trust, is, an, fi, the, trust, or, the, trustee, will, have, an, obligation, to, report, to, its, local, tax, authority, in, cyprus, in, respects, to, the, reportable, accounts, the, income, and, profits, derived, within, and, outside, of, cyprus, are, liable, to, every, possible, taxation, imposed, in, cyprus, if, the, beneficiary, is, a, resident, of, cyprus, in, accordance, with, the, income, tax, laws, of, cyprus, if, the, beneficiaries, are, not, cyprus, residents, then, any, income, and, profit, derived, from, cypriot, sources, will, be, subject, to, tax, relevant, to, consider, is, what, income, is, subject, to, taxation, in, cyprus, and, the, none, domicile, regime, applicable, in, cyprus, as, noted, above, the, english, trust, arose, from, the, court, of, the, lord, chancellor, known, as, the, court, of, chancery, there, are, several, features, which, distinguish, the, modern, english, trust, both, from, other, common, law, trusts, and, from, civil, law, approaches, in, some, ways, the, modern, english, trust, is, when, compared, to, other, jurisdictions, more, conservative, in, its, requirements, for, example, it, retains, the, requirement, that, there, be, a, beneficiary, there, are, two, main, exceptions, to, this, rule, charitable, purpose, trusts, and, re, denley, trusts, this, contrasts, with, other, jurisdictions, like, cyprus, the, bvi, the, cayman, islands, the, isle, of, man, jersey, and, gibraltar, which, allow, for, non, charitable, purpose, trusts, to, be, valid, this, will, normally, be, done, by, appointing, a, somebody, to, act, as, the, trust, s, protector, these, purpose, trusts, allow, for, a, trust, to, be, created, with, a, purpose, eg, to, provide, for, n, s, education, where, n, is, a, family, member, instead, of, a, named, beneficiary, the, role, of, the, protector, also, sometimes, called, an, enforcer, is, to, hold, the, trustees, to, account, which, the, beneficiaries, would, usually, have, the, right, to, do, a, major, use, of, trusts, is, to, allow, for, the, existence, of, unincorporated, associations, these, often, are, associations, or, groups, of, people, that, come, together, for, a, particular, usually, non, commercial, purpose, common, examples, might, be, local, social, and, sports, clubs, some, gentlemen, s, clubs, and, some, professional, associations, the, main, way, that, english, law, supports, the, existence, of, these, is, by, understanding, them, as, a, form, of, trust, the, association, has, no, legal, personality, ie, the, capacity, to, enter, into, legal, relations, in, their, own, name, this, contrasts, with, the, approach, taken, in, many, civil, law, jurisdictions, like, spain, or, france, where, civil, or, social, associations, are, often, accorded, legal, personhood, thus, in, england, the, officers, of, an, association, eg, its, chairman, secretary, and, treasurer, will, be, recognised, as, trustees, and, will, hold, the, assets, of, the, association, on, trust, for, the, members, of, the, association, with, the, constitution, of, the, association, forming, the, basis, of, the, rules, governing, the, trust, in, many, ways, trusts, in, south, africa, operate, similarly, to, other, common, law, countries, although, the, law, of, south, africa, is, actually, a, hybrid, of, the, british, common, law, system, and, roman, dutch, law, in, south, africa, in, addition, to, the, traditional, living, trusts, and, will, trusts, there, is, a, bewind, trust, inherited, from, the, roman, dutch, bewind, administered, by, a, bewindhebber, in, which, the, beneficiaries, own, the, trust, assets, while, the, trustee, administers, the, trust, although, this, is, regarded, by, modern, dutch, law, as, not, actually, a, trust, bewind, trusts, are, created, as, trading, vehicles, providing, trustees, with, limited, liability, and, certain, tax, advantages, in, south, africa, minor, children, cannot, inherit, assets, and, in, the, absence, of, a, trust, and, assets, held, in, a, state, institution, the, guardian, s, fund, and, released, to, the, children, in, adulthood, therefore, testamentary, will, trusts, often, leave, assets, in, a, trust, for, the, benefit, of, these, minor, children, there, are, two, types, of, living, trusts, in, south, africa, namely, vested, trusts, and, discretionary, trusts, in, vested, trusts, the, benefits, of, the, beneficiaries, are, set, out, in, the, trust, deed, whereas, in, discretionary, trusts, the, trustees, have, full, discretion, at, all, times, as, to, how, much, and, when, each, beneficiary, is, to, benefit, until, recently, there, were, tax, advantages, to, living, trusts, in, south, africa, although, most, of, these, advantages, have, been, removed, protection, of, assets, from, creditors, is, a, modern, advantage, with, notable, exceptions, assets, held, by, the, trust, are, not, owned, by, the, trustees, or, the, beneficiaries, the, creditors, of, trustees, or, beneficiaries, can, have, no, claim, against, the, trust, under, the, insolvency, act, act, 24, of, 1936, assets, transferred, into, a, living, trust, remain, at, risk, from, external, creditors, for, 6, months, if, the, previous, owner, of, the, assets, is, solvent, at, the, time, of, transfer, or, 24, months, if, he, she, is, insolvent, at, the, time, of, transfer, after, 24, months, creditors, have, no, claim, against, assets, in, the, trust, although, they, can, attempt, to, attach, the, loan, account, thereby, forcing, the, trust, to, sell, its, assets, assets, can, be, transferred, into, the, living, trust, by, selling, it, to, the, trust, through, a, loan, granted, to, the, trust, or, donating, cash, to, it, any, natural, person, can, donate, r100, 000, per, year, without, attracting, donations, tax, 20, donations, tax, applies, to, further, donations, within, the, same, tax, year, under, south, african, law, living, trusts, are, considered, tax, payers, two, types, of, tax, apply, to, living, trusts, namely, income, tax, and,
