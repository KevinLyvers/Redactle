ancient, greek, hell, nik, includes, the, forms, of, the, greek, language, used, in, ancient, greece, and, the, ancient, world, from, around, 1500, bc, to, 300, bc, it, is, often, roughly, divided, into, the, following, periods, mycenaean, greek, c, 1400, 1200, bc, dark, ages, c, 1200, 800, bc, the, archaic, or, epic, period, c, 800, 500, bc, and, the, classical, period, c, 500, 300, bc, ancient, greek, was, the, language, of, homer, and, of, fifth, century, athenian, historians, playwrights, and, philosophers, it, has, contributed, many, words, to, english, vocabulary, and, has, been, a, standard, subject, of, study, in, educational, institutions, of, the, western, world, since, the, renaissance, this, article, primarily, contains, information, about, the, epic, and, classical, periods, of, the, language, which, are, the, best, attested, periods, and, considered, most, typical, of, ancient, greek, from, the, hellenistic, period, c, 300, bc, ancient, greek, was, followed, by, koine, greek, which, is, regarded, as, a, separate, historical, stage, though, its, earliest, form, closely, resembles, attic, greek, and, its, latest, form, approaches, medieval, greek, there, were, several, regional, dialects, of, ancient, greek, attic, greek, developed, into, koine, ancient, greek, was, a, pluricentric, language, divided, into, many, dialects, the, main, dialect, groups, are, attic, and, ionic, aeolic, arcadocypriot, and, doric, many, of, them, with, several, subdivisions, some, dialects, are, found, in, standardized, literary, forms, in, literature, while, others, are, attested, only, in, inscriptions, there, are, also, several, historical, forms, homeric, greek, is, a, literary, form, of, archaic, greek, derived, primarily, from, ionic, and, aeolic, used, in, the, epic, poems, the, iliad, and, the, odyssey, and, in, later, poems, by, other, authors, homeric, greek, had, significant, differences, in, grammar, and, pronunciation, from, classical, attic, and, other, classical, era, dialects, the, origins, early, form, and, development, of, the, hellenic, language, family, are, not, well, understood, because, of, a, lack, of, contemporaneous, evidence, several, theories, exist, about, what, hellenic, dialect, groups, may, have, existed, between, the, divergence, of, early, greek, like, speech, from, the, common, proto, indo, european, language, and, the, classical, period, they, have, the, same, general, outline, but, differ, in, some, of, the, detail, the, only, attested, dialect, from, this, period, is, mycenaean, greek, but, its, relationship, to, the, historical, dialects, and, the, historical, circumstances, of, the, times, imply, that, the, overall, groups, already, existed, in, some, form, scholars, assume, that, major, ancient, greek, period, dialect, groups, developed, not, later, than, 1120, bc, at, the, time, of, the, dorian, invasions, and, that, their, first, appearances, as, precise, alphabetic, writing, began, in, the, 8th, century, bc, the, invasion, would, not, be, dorian, unless, the, invaders, had, some, cultural, relationship, to, the, historical, dorians, the, invasion, is, known, to, have, displaced, population, to, the, later, attic, ionic, regions, who, regarded, themselves, as, descendants, of, the, population, displaced, by, or, contending, with, the, dorians, the, greeks, of, this, period, believed, there, were, three, major, divisions, of, all, greek, people, dorians, aeolians, and, ionians, including, athenians, each, with, their, own, defining, and, distinctive, dialects, allowing, for, their, oversight, of, arcadian, an, obscure, mountain, dialect, and, cypriot, far, from, the, center, of, greek, scholarship, this, division, of, people, and, language, is, quite, similar, to, the, results, of, modern, archaeological, linguistic, investigation, one, standard, formulation, for, the, dialects, is, west, vs, non, west, greek, is, the, strongest, marked, and, earliest, division, with, non, west, in, subsets, of, ionic, attic, or, attic, ionic, and, aeolic, vs, arcadocypriot, or, aeolic, and, arcado, cypriot, vs, ionic, attic, often, non, west, is, called, east, greek, arcadocypriot, apparently, descended, more, closely, from, the, mycenaean, greek, of, the, bronze, age, boeotian, greek, had, come, under, a, strong, northwest, greek, influence, and, can, in, some, respects, be, considered, a, transitional, dialect, as, exemplified, in, the, poems, of, the, boeotian, poet, pindar, who, wrote, in, doric, with, a, small, aeolic, admixture, thessalian, likewise, had, come, under, northwest, greek, influence, though, to, a, lesser, degree, pamphylian, greek, spoken, in, a, small, area, on, the, southwestern, coast, of, anatolia, and, little, preserved, in, inscriptions, may, be, either, a, fifth, major, dialect, group, or, it, is, mycenaean, greek, overlaid, by, doric, with, a, non, greek, native, influence, regarding, the, speech, of, the, ancient, macedonians, diverse, theories, have, been, put, forward, but, the, epigraphic, activity, and, the, archaeological, discoveries, in, the, greek, region, of, macedonia, during, the, last, decades, has, brought, to, light, documents, among, which, the, first, texts, written, in, macedonian, such, as, the, pella, curse, tablet, as, hatzopoulos, and, other, scholars, note, based, on, the, conclusions, drawn, by, several, studies, and, findings, such, as, pella, curse, tablet, emilio, crespo, and, other, scholars, suggest, that, ancient, macedonian, was, a, northwest, doric, dialect, which, shares, isoglosses, with, its, neighboring, thessalian, dialects, spoken, in, northeastern, thessaly, some, have, also, suggested, an, aeolic, greek, classification, the, lesbian, dialect, was, aeolic, for, example, fragments, of, the, works, of, the, poet, sappho, from, the, island, of, lesbos, are, in, aeolian, most, of, the, dialect, sub, groups, listed, above, had, further, subdivisions, generally, equivalent, to, a, city, state, and, its, surrounding, territory, or, to, an, island, doric, notably, had, several, intermediate, divisions, as, well, into, island, doric, including, cretan, doric, southern, peloponnesus, doric, including, laconian, the, dialect, of, sparta, and, northern, peloponnesus, doric, including, corinthian, all, the, groups, were, represented, by, colonies, beyond, greece, proper, as, well, and, these, colonies, generally, developed, local, characteristics, often, under, the, influence, of, settlers, or, neighbors, speaking, different, greek, dialects, after, the, conquests, of, alexander, the, great, in, the, late, 4th, century, bc, a, new, international, dialect, known, as, koine, or, common, greek, developed, largely, based, on, attic, greek, but, with, influence, from, other, dialects, this, dialect, slowly, replaced, most, of, the, older, dialects, although, the, doric, dialect, has, survived, in, the, tsakonian, language, which, is, spoken, in, the, region, of, modern, sparta, doric, has, also, passed, down, its, aorist, terminations, into, most, verbs, of, demotic, greek, by, about, the, 6th, century, ad, the, koine, had, slowly, metamorphosed, into, medieval, greek, phrygian, is, an, extinct, indo, european, language, of, west, and, central, anatolia, which, is, considered, by, some, linguists, to, have, been, closely, related, to, greek, among, indo, european, branches, with, living, descendants, greek, is, often, argued, to, have, the, closest, genetic, ties, with, armenian, see, also, graeco, armenian, and, indo, iranian, languages, see, graeco, aryan, ancient, greek, differs, from, proto, indo, european, pie, and, other, indo, european, languages, in, certain, ways, in, phonotactics, ancient, greek, words, could, end, only, in, a, vowel, or, n, s, r, final, stops, were, lost, as, in, milk, compared, with, of, milk, genitive, ancient, greek, of, the, classical, period, also, differed, in, both, the, inventory, and, distribution, of, original, pie, phonemes, due, to, numerous, sound, changes, notably, the, following, the, pronunciation, of, ancient, greek, was, very, different, from, that, of, modern, greek, ancient, greek, had, long, and, short, vowels, many, diphthongs, double, and, single, consonants, voiced, voiceless, and, aspirated, stops, and, a, pitch, accent, in, modern, greek, all, vowels, and, consonants, are, short, many, vowels, and, diphthongs, once, pronounced, distinctly, are, pronounced, as, i, iotacism, some, of, the, stops, and, glides, in, diphthongs, have, become, fricatives, and, the, pitch, accent, has, changed, to, a, stress, accent, many, of, the, changes, took, place, in, the, koine, greek, period, the, writing, system, of, modern, greek, however, does, not, reflect, all, pronunciation, changes, the, examples, below, represent, attic, greek, in, the, 5th, century, bc, ancient, pronunciation, cannot, be, reconstructed, with, certainty, but, greek, from, the, period, is, well, documented, and, there, is, little, disagreement, among, linguists, as, to, the, general, nature, of, the, sounds, that, the, letters, represent, o, raised, to, probably, by, the, 4th, century, bc, greek, like, all, of, the, older, indo, european, languages, is, highly, inflected, it, is, highly, archaic, in, its, preservation, of, proto, indo, european, forms, in, ancient, greek, nouns, including, proper, nouns, have, five, cases, nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, and, vocative, three, genders, masculine, feminine, and, neuter, and, three, numbers, singular, dual, and, plural, verbs, have, four, moods, indicative, imperative, subjunctive, and, optative, and, three, voices, active, middle, and, passive, as, well, as, three, persons, first, second, and, third, and, various, other, forms, verbs, are, conjugated, through, seven, combinations, of, tenses, and, aspect, generally, simply, called, tenses, the, present, future, and, imperfect, are, imperfective, in, aspect, the, aorist, present, perfect, pluperfect, and, future, perfect, are, perfective, in, aspect, most, tenses, display, all, four, moods, and, three, voices, although, there, is, no, future, subjunctive, or, imperative, also, there, is, no, imperfect, subjunctive, optative, or, imperative, the, infinitives, and, participles, correspond, to, the, finite, combinations, of, tense, aspect, and, voice, the, indicative, of, past, tenses, adds, conceptually, at, least, a, prefix, e, called, the, augment, this, was, probably, originally, a, separate, word, meaning, something, like, then, added, because, tenses, in, pie, had, primarily, aspectual, meaning, the, augment, is, added, to, the, indicative, of, the, aorist, imperfect, and, pluperfect, but, not, to, any, of, the, other, forms, of, the, aorist, no, other, forms, of, the, imperfect, and, pluperfect, exist, the, two, kinds, of, augment, in, greek, are, syllabic, and, quantitative, the, syllabic, augment, is, added, to, stems, beginning, with, consonants, and, simply, prefixes, e, stems, beginning, with, r, however, add, er, the, quantitative, augment, is, added, to, stems, beginning, with, vowels, and, involves, lengthening, the, vowel, some, verbs, augment, irregularly, the, most, common, variation, is, e, ei, the, irregularity, can, be, explained, diachronically, by, the, loss, of, s, between, vowels, or, that, of, the, letter, w, which, affected, the, augment, when, it, was, word, initial, in, verbs, with, a, preposition, as, a, prefix, the, augment, is, placed, not, at, the, start, of, the, word, but, between, the, preposition, and, the, original, verb, for, example, i, attack, goes, to, o, in, the, aorist, however, compound, verbs, consisting, of, a, prefix, that, is, not, a, preposition, retain, the, augment, at, the, start, of, the, word, goes, to, in, the, aorist, following, homer, s, practice, the, augment, is, sometimes, not, made, in, poetry, especially, epic, poetry, the, augment, sometimes, substitutes, for, reduplication, see, below, almost, all, forms, of, the, perfect, pluperfect, and, future, perfect, reduplicate, the, initial, syllable, of, the, verb, stem, a, few, irregular, forms, of, perfect, do, not, reduplicate, whereas, a, handful, of, irregular, aorists, reduplicate, the, three, types, of, reduplication, are, irregular, duplication, can, be, understood, diachronically, for, example, lamban, root, lab, has, the, perfect, stem, eil, pha, not, lel, pha, because, it, was, originally, slamban, with, perfect, sesl, pha, becoming, eil, pha, through, compensatory, lengthening, reduplication, is, also, visible, in, the, present, tense, stems, of, certain, verbs, these, stems, add, a, syllable, consisting, of, the, root, s, initial, consonant, followed, by, i, a, nasal, stop, appears, after, the, reduplication, in, some, verbs, the, earliest, extant, examples, of, ancient, greek, writing, c, 1450, bc, are, in, the, syllabic, script, linear, b, beginning, in, the, 8th, century, bc, however, the, greek, alphabet, became, standard, albeit, with, some, variation, among, dialects, early, texts, are, written, in, boustrophedon, style, but, left, to, right, became, standard, during, the, classic, period, modern, editions, of, ancient, greek, texts, are, usually, written, with, accents, and, breathing, marks, interword, spacing, modern, punctuation, and, sometimes, mixed, case, but, these, were, all, introduced, later, the, beginning, of, homer, s, iliad, exemplifies, the, archaic, period, of, ancient, greek, see, homeric, greek, for, more, details, the, beginning, of, apology, by, plato, exemplifies, attic, greek, from, the,

occupied, an, important, place, in, the, syllabus, from, the, renaissance, until, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, this, was, true, as, well, in, the, united, states, where, many, of, the, nation, s, founders, received, a, classically, based, education, latin, was, emphasized, in, american, colleges, but, greek, also, was, required, in, the, colonial, and, early, national, eras, and, the, study, of, ancient, greece, became, increasingly, popular, in, the, mid, to, late, nineteenth, century, the, age, of, american, philhellenism, in, particular, female, intellectuals, of, the, era, designated, the, mastering, of, ancient, greek, as, essential, in, becoming, a, woman, of, letters, ancient, greek, is, still, taught, as, a, compulsory, or, optional, subject, especially, at,

recognition, and, acceptance, of, teachers, modern, authors, rarely, write, in, ancient, greek, though, jan, k, esadlo, wrote, some, poetry, and, prose, in, the, language, and, harry, potter, and,
