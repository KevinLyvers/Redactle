netherlands, the, icj, is, the, successor, of, the, permanent, court, of, international, justice, pcij, which, was, established, in, 1920, by, the, league, of, nations, after, the, second, world, war, the, league, and, the, pcij, were, replaced, by, the, united, nations, and, icj, respectively, the, statute, of, the, icj, which, sets, forth, its, purpose, and, structure, draws, heavily, from, that, of, its, predecessor, whose, decisions, remain, valid, all, member, states, of, the, un, are, party, to, the, icj, statute, and, may, initiate, contentious, legal, cases, however, advisory, proceedings, may, be, submitted, only, by, certain, un, organs, and, agencies, the, icj, consists, of, a, panel, of, 15, judges, elected, by, the, un, general, assembly, and, security, council, for, nine, year, terms, no, more, than, one, judge, of, each, nationality, may, be, represented, on, court, at, the, same, time, and, judges, collectively, must, reflect, the, principal, civilizations, and, legal, systems, of, the, world, seated, in, the, peace, palace, in, the, hague, netherlands, the, icj, is, the, only, principal, un, organ, not, located, in, new, york, city, its, official, working, languages, are, english, and, french, since, the, entry, of, its, first, case, on, 22, may, 1947, the, icj, has, entertained, 191, cases, through, 13, november, 2023, pursuant, to, article, 59, of, the, statute, of, the, international, court, of, justice, the, court, s, rulings, and, opinions, are, binding, on, the, parties, with, respect, to, the, particular, case, ruled, on, by, the, court, the, first, permanent, institution, established, for, the, purpose, of, settling, international, disputes, was, the, permanent, court, of, arbitration, pca, which, was, created, by, the, hague, peace, conference, of, 1899, initiated, by, the, russian, tsar, nicholas, ii, the, conference, involved, all, the, world, s, major, powers, as, well, as, several, smaller, states, and, resulted, in, the, first, multilateral, treaties, concerned, with, the, conduct, of, warfare, among, these, was, the, convention, for, the, pacific, settlement, of, international, disputes, which, set, forth, the, institutional, and, procedural, framework, for, arbitral, proceedings, which, would, take, place, in, the, hague, netherlands, although, the, proceedings, would, be, supported, by, a, permanent, bureau, whose, functions, would, be, equivalent, to, that, of, a, secretariat, or, court, registry, the, arbitrators, would, be, appointed, by, the, disputing, states, from, a, larger, pool, provided, by, each, member, of, the, convention, the, pca, was, established, in, 1900, and, began, proceedings, in, 1902, a, second, hague, peace, conference, in, 1907, which, involved, most, of, the, world, s, sovereign, states, revised, the, convention, and, enhanced, the, rules, governing, arbitral, proceedings, before, the, pca, during, this, conference, the, united, states, great, britain, and, germany, submitted, a, joint, proposal, for, a, permanent, court, whose, judges, would, serve, full, time, as, the, delegates, could, not, agree, how, the, judges, would, be, selected, the, matter, was, shelved, pending, an, agreement, to, be, adopted, at, a, later, convention, the, hague, peace, conferences, and, the, ideas, that, emerged, therefrom, influenced, the, creation, of, the, central, american, court, of, justice, which, was, established, in, 1908, as, one, of, the, earliest, regional, judicial, bodies, various, plans, and, proposals, were, made, between, 1911, and, 1919, for, the, establishment, of, an, international, judicial, tribunal, which, would, not, be, realized, in, the, formation, of, a, new, international, system, following, the, first, world, war, the, unprecedented, bloodshed, of, the, first, world, war, led, to, the, creation, of, the, league, of, nations, established, by, the, paris, peace, conference, of, 1919, as, the, first, worldwide, intergovernmental, organization, aimed, at, maintaining, peace, and, collective, security, article, 14, league, s, covenant, called, for, the, establishment, of, a, permanent, court, of, international, justice, pcij, which, would, be, responsible, for, adjudicating, any, international, dispute, submitted, to, it, by, the, contesting, parties, as, well, as, to, provide, an, advisory, opinion, upon, any, dispute, or, question, referred, to, it, by, the, league, of, nations, in, december, 1920, following, several, drafts, and, debates, the, assembly, of, the, league, unanimously, adopted, the, statute, of, the, pcij, which, was, signed, and, ratified, the, following, year, by, a, majority, of, members, among, other, things, the, new, statute, resolved, the, contentious, issues, of, selecting, judges, by, providing, that, the, judges, be, elected, by, both, the, council, and, the, assembly, of, the, league, concurrently, but, independently, the, makeup, of, the, pcij, would, reflect, the, main, forms, of, civilization, and, the, principal, legal, systems, of, the, world, the, pcij, would, be, permanently, placed, at, the, peace, palace, in, the, hague, alongside, permanent, court, of, arbitration, the, pcij, represented, a, major, innovation, in, international, jurisprudence, in, several, ways, unlike, the, icj, the, pcij, was, not, part, of, the, league, nor, were, members, of, the, league, automatically, a, party, to, its, statute, the, united, states, which, played, a, key, role, in, both, the, second, hague, peace, conference, and, the, paris, peace, conference, was, notably, not, a, member, of, the, league, however, several, of, its, nationals, served, as, judges, of, the, court, from, its, first, session, in, 1922, until, 1940, the, pcij, dealt, with, 29, interstate, disputes, and, issued, 27, advisory, opinions, the, court, s, widespread, acceptance, was, reflected, by, the, fact, that, several, hundred, international, treaties, and, agreements, conferred, jurisdiction, upon, it, over, specified, categories, of, disputes, in, addition, to, helping, resolve, several, serious, international, disputes, the, pcij, helped, clarify, several, ambiguities, in, international, law, that, contributed, to, its, development, the, united, states, played, a, major, role, in, setting, up, the, pcij, but, never, joined, presidents, wilson, harding, coolidge, hoover, and, roosevelt, all, supported, membership, but, it, was, impossible, to, get, a, two, thirds, majority, in, the, senate, for, a, treaty, following, a, peak, of, activity, in, 1933, the, pcij, began, to, decline, in, its, activities, due, to, the, growing, international, tension, and, isolationism, that, characterized, the, era, the, second, world, war, effectively, put, an, end, to, the, court, which, held, its, last, public, session, in, december, 1939, and, issued, its, last, orders, in, february, 1940, in, 1942, the, united, states, and, united, kingdom, jointly, declared, support, for, establishing, or, re, establishing, an, international, court, after, the, war, and, in, 1943, the, u, k, chaired, a, panel, of, jurists, from, around, the, world, the, inter, allied, committee, to, discuss, the, matter, its, 1944, report, recommended, that, several, months, later, at, the, moscow, conference, in, 1943, the, major, allied, powers, china, the, ussr, the, u, k, and, the, u, s, issued, a, joint, declaration, recognizing, the, necessity, of, establishing, at, the, earliest, practicable, date, a, general, international, organization, based, on, the, principle, of, the, sovereign, equality, of, all, peace, loving, states, and, open, to, membership, by, all, such, states, large, and, small, for, the, maintenance, of, international, peace, and, security, the, following, allied, conference, at, dumbarton, oaks, in, the, united, states, published, a, proposal, in, october, 1944, that, called, for, the, establishment, of, an, intergovernmental, organization, that, would, include, an, international, court, a, meeting, was, subsequently, convened, in, washington, d, c, in, april, 1945, involving, 44, jurists, from, around, the, world, to, draft, a, statute, for, the, proposed, court, the, draft, statute, was, substantially, similar, to, that, of, the, pcij, and, it, was, questioned, whether, a, new, court, should, even, be, created, during, the, san, francisco, conference, which, took, place, from, 25, april, to, 26, june, 1945, and, involved, 50, countries, it, was, decided, that, an, entirely, new, court, should, be, established, as, a, principal, organ, of, the, new, united, nations, the, statute, of, this, court, would, form, an, integral, part, of, the, united, nations, charter, which, to, maintain, continuity, expressly, held, that, the, statute, of, the, international, court, of, justice, icj, was, based, upon, that, of, the, pcij, consequently, the, pcij, convened, for, the, last, time, in, october, 1945, and, resolved, to, transfer, its, archives, to, its, successor, which, would, take, its, place, at, the, peace, palace, the, judges, of, the, pcij, all, resigned, on, 31, january, 1946, with, the, election, of, the, first, members, of, the, icj, taking, place, the, following, february, at, the, first, session, of, the, united, nations, general, assembly, and, security, council, in, april, 1946, the, pcij, was, formally, dissolved, and, the, icj, in, its, first, meeting, was, elected, president, jos, gustavo, guerrero, of, el, salvador, who, had, served, as, the, last, president, of, the, pcij, the, court, also, appointed, members, of, its, registry, mainly, drawn, from, that, of, the, pcij, and, held, an, inaugural, public, sitting, later, that, month, the, first, case, was, submitted, in, may, 1947, by, the, united, kingdom, against, albania, concerning, incidents, in, the, corfu, channel, established, in, 1945, by, the, un, charter, the, court, began, work, in, 1946, as, the, successor, to, the, permanent, court, of, international, justice, the, statute, of, the, international, court, of, justice, similar, to, that, of, its, predecessor, is, the, main, constitutional, document, constituting, and, regulating, the, court, the, court, s, workload, covers, a, wide, range, of, judicial, activity, after, the, court, ruled, that, the, united, states, s, covert, war, against, nicaragua, was, in, violation, of, international, law, nicaragua, v, united, states, the, united, states, withdrew, from, compulsory, jurisdiction, in, 1986, to, accept, the, court, s, jurisdiction, only, on, a, discretionary, basis, chapter, xiv, of, the, united, nations, charter, authorizes, the, un, security, council, to, enforce, court, rulings, however, such, enforcement, is, subject, to, the, veto, power, of, the, five, permanent, members, of, the, council, which, the, united, states, used, in, the, nicaragua, case, the, icj, is, composed, of, fifteen, judges, elected, to, nine, year, terms, by, the, un, general, assembly, and, the, un, security, council, from, a, list, of, people, nominated, by, the, national, groups, in, the, permanent, court, of, arbitration, the, election, process, is, set, out, in, articles, 4, 19, of, the, icj, statute, elections, are, staggered, with, five, judges, elected, every, three, years, to, ensure, continuity, within, the, court, should, a, judge, die, in, office, the, practice, has, generally, been, to, elect, a, judge, in, a, special, election, to, complete, the, term, historically, deceased, judges, have, been, replaced, by, judges, from, the, same, region, though, not, as, often, wrongly, asserted, necessarily, from, the, same, nationality, article, 3, states, that, no, two, judges, may, be, nationals, of, the, same, country, according, to, article, 9, the, membership, of, the, court, is, supposed, to, represent, the, main, forms, of, civilization, and, of, the, principal, legal, systems, of, the, world, this, has, been, interpreted, to, include, common, law, civil, law, socialist, law, and, islamic, law, while, the, precise, meaning, of, main, forms, of, civilization, is, contested, there, is, an, informal, understanding, that, the, seats, will, be, distributed, by, geographic, regions, so, that, there, are, five, seats, for, western, countries, three, for, african, states, including, one, judge, of, francophone, civil, law, one, of, anglophone, common, law, and, one, arab, two, for, eastern, european, states, three, for, asian, states, and, two, for, latin, american, and, caribbean, states, for, most, of, the, court, s, history, the, five, permanent, members, of, the, united, nations, security, council, france, ussr, china, the, united, kingdom, and, the, united, states, have, always, had, a, judge, serving, thereby, occupying, three, of, the, western, seats, one, of, the, asian, seats, and, one, of, the, eastern, european, seats, exceptions, have, been, china, not, having, a, judge, on, the, court, from, 1967, to, 1985, during, which, time, it, did, not, put, forward, a, candidate, and, british, judge, sir, christopher, greenwood, being, withdrawn, as, a, candidate, for, election, for, a, second, nine, year, term, on, the, bench, in, 2017, leaving, no, judges, from, the, united, kingdom, on, the, court, greenwood, had, been, supported, by, the, un, security, council, but, failed, to, get, a, majority, in, the, un, general, assembly, indian, judge, dalveer, bhandari, took, the, seat, instead, article, 6, of, the, statute, provides, that, all, judges, should, be, elected, regardless, of, their, nationality, among, persons, of, high, moral, character, who, are, either, qualified, for, the, highest, judicial, office, in, their, home, states, or, known, as, lawyers, with, sufficient, competence, in, international, law, judicial, independence, is, dealt, with, specifically, in, articles, 16, 18, to, insure, impartiality, article, 16, of, the, charter, requires, independence, from, their, national, governments, or, other, interested, parties, stating, no, member, of, the, court, may, exercise, any, political, or, administrative, function, or, engage, in, any, other, occupation, of, a, professional, nature, in, addition, article, 17, requires, that, judges, do, not, show, any, prior, biases, on, cases, before, them, specifically, no, member, may, participate, in, the, decision, of, any, case, in, which, he, has, previously, taken, part, as, agent, counsel, or, advocate, for, one, of, the, parties, or, as, a, member, of, a, national, or, international, court, or, of, a, commission, of, enquiry, or, in, any, other, capacity, judges, of, the, international, court, of, justice, are, entitled, to, the, style, of, his, her, excellency, judges, are, not, able, to, hold, any, other, post, or, act, as, counsel, in, practice, members, of, the, court, have, their, own, interpretation, of, these, rules, and, many, have, chosen, to, remain, involved, in, outside, arbitration, and, hold, professional, posts, as, long, as, there, is, no, conflict, of, interest, former, judge, bruno, simma, and, current, judge, georg, nolte, have, acknowledged, that, moonlighting, should, be, restricted, a, judge, can, be, dismissed, only, by, a, unanimous, vote, of, the, other, members, of, the, court, despite, these, provisions, the, independence, of, icj, judges, has, been, questioned, for, example, during, the, nicaragua, case, the, united, states, issued, a, communiqu, suggesting, that, it, could, not, present, sensitive, material, to, the, court, because, of, the, presence, of, judges, from, the, soviet, bloc, judges, may, deliver, joint, judgments, or, give, their, own, separate, opinions, decisions, and, advisory, opinions, are, by, majority, and, in, the, event, of, an, equal, division, the, president, s, vote, becomes, decisive, which, occurred, in, the, legality, of, the, use, by, a, state, of, nuclear, weapons, in, armed, conflict, opinion, requested, by, who, icj, reports, 66, judges, may, also, deliver, separate, dissenting, opinions, in, its, 77, years, of, history, only, five, women, have, been, elected, to, the, court, with, former, un, special, rapporteur, philip, alston, calling, for, states, to, take, seriously, questions, of, representation, in, the, bench, in, 2023, judges, elected, to, take, office, from, 2024, did, not, include, a, russian, member, so, for, the, first, time, from, 2024, there, will, be, no, member, from, the, commonwealth, of, independent, states, this, is, also, the, first, time, that, russia, would, not, have, a, judge, on, the, icj, even, going, back, to, its, predecessor, the, soviet, union, article, 31, of, the, statute, sets, out, a, procedure, whereby, ad, hoc, judges, sit, on, contentious, cases, before, the, court, the, system, allows, any, party, to, a, contentious, case, if, it, otherwise, does, not, have, one, of, that, party, s, nationals, sitting, on, the, court, to, select, one, additional, person, to, sit, as, a, judge, on, that, case, only, it, is, thus, possible, that, as, many, as, seventeen, judges, may, sit, on, one, case, the, system, may, seem, strange, when, compared, with, domestic, court, processes, but, its, purpose, is, to, encourage, states, to, submit, cases, for, example, if, a, state, knows, that, it, will, have, a, judicial, officer, who, can, participate, in, deliberation, and, offer, other, judges, local, knowledge, and, an, understanding, of, the, state, s, perspective, it, may, be, more, willing, to, submit, to, the, jurisdiction, of, the, court, although, this, system, does, not, sit, well, with, the, judicial, nature, of, the, body, it, is, usually, of, little, practical, consequence, ad, hoc, judges, usually, but, not, always, vote, in, favour, of, the, state, that, appointed, them, and, thus, cancel, each, other, out, generally, the, court, sits, as, full, bench, but, in, the, last, fifteen, years, it, has, on, occasion, sat, as, a, chamber, articles, 26, 29, of, the, statute, allow, the, court, to, form, smaller, chambers, usually, 3, or, 5, judges, to, hear, cases, two, types, of, chambers, are, contemplated, by, article, 26, firstly, chambers, for, special, categories, of, cases, and, second, the, formation, of, ad, hoc, chambers, to, hear, particular, disputes, in, 1993, a, special, chamber, was, established, under, article, 26, 1, of, the, icj, statute, to, deal, specifically, with, environmental, matters, although, it, has, never, been, used, ad, hoc, chambers, are, more, frequently, convened, for, example, chambers, were, used, to, hear, the, gulf, of, maine, case, canada, us, in, that, case, the, parties, made, clear, they, would, withdraw, the, case, unless, the, court, appointed, judges, to, the, chamber, acceptable, to, the, parties, judgments, of, chambers, may, have, either, less, authority, than, full, court, judgments, or, diminish, the, proper, interpretation, of, universal, international, law, informed, by, a, variety, of, cultural, and, legal, perspectives, on, the, other, hand, the, use, of, chambers, might, encourage, greater, recourse, to, the, court, and, thus, enhance, international, dispute, resolution, as, of, 6, february, 2024, the, composition, of, the, court, is, as, follows, as, stated, in, article, 93, of, the, un, charter, all, 193, un, members, are, automatically, parties, to, the, court, s, statute, non, un, members, may, also, become, parties, to, the, court, s, statute, under, the, article, 93, 2, procedure, which, was, used, by, switzerland, in, 1948, and, nauru, in, 1988, prior, to, either, joining, the, un, once, a, state, is, a, party, to, the, court, s, statute, it, is, entitled, to, participate, in, cases, before, the, court, however, being, a, party, to, the, statute, does, not, automatically, give, the, court, jurisdiction, over, disputes, involving, those, parties, the, issue, of, jurisdiction, is, considered, in, the, three, types, of, icj, cases, contentious, issues, incidental, jurisdiction, and, advisory, opinions, in, contentious, cases, adversarial, proceedings, seeking, to, settle, a, dispute, the, icj, produces, a, binding, ruling, between, states, that, agree, to, submit, to, the, ruling, of, the, court, only, states, may, be, parties, in, contentious, cases, individuals, corporations, component, parts, of, a, federal, state, ngos, un, organs, and, self, determination, groups, are, excluded, from, direct, participation, although, the, court, may, receive, information, from, public, international, organizations, however, this, does, not, preclude, non, state, interests, from, being, the, subject, of, proceedings, for, example, a, state, may, bring, a, case, on, behalf, of, one, of, its, nationals, or, corporations, such, as, in, matters, concerning, diplomatic, protection, jurisdiction, is, often, a, crucial, question, for, the, court, in, contentious, cases, the, key, principle, is, that, the, icj, has, jurisdiction, only, on, the, basis, of, consent, under, article, 36, there, are, four, foundations, for, the, court, s, jurisdiction, additionally, the, court, may, have, jurisdiction, on, the, basis, of, tacit, consent, forum, prorogatum, in, the, absence, of, clear, jurisdiction, under, article, 36, jurisdiction, is, established, if, the, respondent, accepts, icj, jurisdiction, explicitly, or, simply, pleads, on, the, merits, this, arose, in, the, 1949, corfu, channel, case, u, k, v, albania, in, which, the, court, held, that, a, letter, from, albania, stating, that, it, submitted, to, the, jurisdiction, of, the, icj, was, sufficient, to, grant, the, court, jurisdiction, until, rendering, a, final, judgment, the, court, has, competence, to, order, interim, measures, for, the, protection, of, the, rights, of, a, party, to, a, dispute, one, or, both, parties, to, a, dispute, may, apply, the, icj, for, issuing, interim, measures, in, the, frontier, dispute, case, both, parties, to, the, dispute, burkina, faso, and, mali, submitted, an, application, to, the, court, to, indicate, interim, measures, incidental, jurisdiction, of, the, court, derives, from, the, article, 41, of, its, statute, similar, to, the, final, judgment, the, order, for, interim, measures, of, the, court, are, binding, on, state, parties, to, the, dispute, the, icj, has, competence, to, indicate, interim, measures, only, if, the, prima, facie, jurisdiction, is, satisfied, an, advisory, opinion, is, a, function, of, the, court, open, only, to, specified, united, nations, bodies, and, agencies, the, un, charter, grants, the, general, assembly, or, the, security, council, the, power, to, request, the, court, to, issue, an, advisory, opinion, on, any, legal, question, organs, of, the, un, other, than, the, general, assembly, or, the, security, council, require, the, general, assembly, s, authorization, to, request, an, advisory, opinion, of, the, icj, these, organs, of, the, un, only, request, an, advisory, opinion, regarding, the, matters, that, fall, within, the, scope, of, their, activities, on, receiving, a, request, the, court, decides, which, states, and, organizations, might, provide, useful, information, and, gives, them, an, opportunity, to, present, written, or, oral, statements, advisory, opinions, were, intended, as, a, means, by, which, un, agencies, could, seek, the, court, s, help, in, deciding, complex, legal, issues, that, might, fall, under, their, respective, mandates, in, principle, the, court, s, advisory, opinions, are, only, consultative, in, character, but, they, are, influential, and, widely, respected, certain, instruments, or, regulations, can, provide, in, advance, that, the, advisory, opinion, shall, be, specifically, binding, on, particular, agencies, or, states, but, inherently, they, are, non, binding, under, the, statute, of, the, court, this, non, binding, character, does, not, mean, that, advisory, opinions, are, without, legal, effect, because, the, legal, reasoning, embodied, in, them, reflects, the, court, s, authoritative, views, on, important, issues, of, international, law, in, arriving, at, them, the, court, follows, essentially, the, same, rules, and, procedures, that, govern, its, binding, judgments, delivered, in, contentious, cases, submitted, to, it, by, sovereign, states, an, advisory, opinion, derives, its, status, and, authority, from, the, fact, that, it, is, the, official, pronouncement, of, the, principal, judicial, organ, of, the, united, nations, advisory, opinions, have, often, been, controversial, because, the, questions, asked, are, controversial, or, the, case, was, pursued, as, an, indirect, way, of, bringing, what, is, really, a, contentious, case, before, the, court, examples, of, advisory, opinions, can, be, found, in, the, section, advisory, opinions, in, the, list, of, international, court, of, justice, cases, article, one, such, well, known, advisory, opinion, is, the, nuclear, weapons, case, article, 94, establishes, the, duty, of, all, un, members, to, comply, with, decisions, of, the, court, involving, them, if, parties, do, not, comply, the, issue, may, be, taken, before, the, security, council, for, enforcement, action, there, are, obvious, problems, with, such, a, method, of, enforcement, if, the, judgment, is, against, one, of, the, five, permanent, members, of, the, security, council, or, its, allies, any, resolution, on, enforcement, could, then, be, vetoed, by, that, member, that, occurred, for, example, after, the, nicaragua, case, when, nicaragua, brought, the, issue, of, the, united, states, noncompliance, with, the, court, s, decision, before, the, security, council, furthermore, if, the, security, council, refuses, to, enforce, a, judgment, against, any, other, state, there, is, no, method, of, forcing, the, state, to, comply, furthermore, the, most, effective, form, to, take, action, for, the, security, council, coercive, action, under, chapter, vii, of, the, united, nations, charter, can, be, justified, only, if, international, peace, and, security, are, at, stake, the, security, council, has, never, done, that, so, far, the, relationship, between, the, icj, and, the, security, council, and, the, separation, of, their, powers, was, considered, by, the, court, in, 1992, in, the, pan, am, case, the, court, had, to, consider, an, application, from, libya, for, the, order, of, provisional, measures, of, protection, to, safeguard, its, rights, which, it, alleged, were, being, infringed, by, the, threat, of, economic, sanctions, by, the, united, kingdom, and, united, states, the, problem, was, that, these, sanctions, had, been, authorized, by, the, security, council, which, resulted, in, a, potential, conflict, between, the, chapter, vii, functions, of, the, security, council, and, the, judicial, function, of, the, court, the, court, decided, by, eleven, votes, to, five, that, it, could, not, order, the, requested, provisional, measures, because, the, rights, claimed, by, libya, even, if, legitimate, under, the, 1971, montreal, convention, could, not, be, prima, facie, regarded, as, appropriate, since, the, action, was, ordered, by, the, security, council, in, accordance, with, article, 103, of, the, un, charter, obligations, under, the, charter, took, precedence, over, other, treaty, obligations, nevertheless, the, court, declared, the, application, admissible, in, 1998, a, decision, on, the, merits, has, not, been, given, since, the, parties, united, kingdom, united, states, and, libya, settled, the, case, out, of, court, in, 2003, there, was, a, marked, reluctance, on, the, part, of, a, majority, of, the, court, to, become, involved, in, a, dispute, in, such, a, way, as, to, bring, it, potentially, into, conflict, with, the, council, the, court, stated, in, the, nicaragua, case, that, there, is, no, necessary, inconsistency, between, action, by, the, security, council, and, adjudication, by, the, icj, however, when, there, is, room, for, conflict, the, balance, appears, to, be, in, favour, of, the, security, council, should, either, party, fail, to, perform, the, obligations, incumbent, upon, it, under, a, judgment, rendered, by, the, court, the, security, council, may, be, called, upon, to, make, recommendations, or, decide, upon, measures, if, the, security, council, deems, such, actions, necessary, in, practice, the, court, s, powers, have, been, limited, by, the, unwillingness, of, the, losing, party, to, abide, by, the, court, s, ruling, and, by, the, security, council, s, unwillingness, to, impose, consequences, however, in, theory, so, far, as, the, parties, to, the, case, are, concerned, a, judgment, of, the, court, is, binding, final, and, without, appeal, and, by, signing, the, charter, a, state, member, of, the, united, nations, undertakes, to, comply, with, any, decision, of, the, international, court, of, justice, in, a, case, to, which, it, is, a, party, for, example, the, united, states, had, previously, accepted, the, court, s, compulsory, jurisdiction, upon, its, creation, in, 1946, but, in, 1984, after, nicaragua, v, united, states, withdrew, its, acceptance, following, the, court, s, judgment, that, called, on, the, us, to, cease, and, to, refrain, from, the, unlawful, use, of, force, against, the, government, of, nicaragua, the, court, ruled, with, only, the, american, judge, dissenting, that, the, united, states, was, in, breach, of, its, obligation, under, the, treaty, of, friendship, with, nicaragua, not, to, use, force, against, nicaragua, and, ordered, the, united, states, to, pay, war, reparations, when, deciding, cases, the, court, applies, international, law, as, summarized, in, article, 38, of, the, icj, statute, which, provides, that, in, arriving, at, its, decisions, the, court, shall, apply, international, conventions, international, custom, and, the, general, principles, of, law, recognized, by, civilized, nations, it, may, also, refer, to, academic, writing, the, teachings, of, the, most, highly, qualified, publicists, of, the, various, nations, and, previous, judicial, decisions, to, help, interpret, the, law, although, the, court, is, not, formally, bound, by, its, previous, decisions, under, the, doctrine, of, stare, decisis, article, 59, makes, clear, that, the, common, law, notion, of, precedent, or, stare, decisis, does, not, apply, to, the, decisions, of, the, icj, the, court, s, decision, binds, only, the, parties, to, that, particular, controversy, under, 38, 1, d, however, the, court, may, consider, its, own, previous, decisions, and, frequently, cites, them, if, the, parties, agree, they, may, also, grant, the, court, the, liberty, to, decide, ex, aequo, et, bono, out, of, equality, and, for, the, good, granting, the, icj, the, freedom, to, make, an, equitable, decision, based, on, what, is, fair, under, the, circumstances, that, provision, has, not, been, used, in, the, court, s, history, so, far, the, international, court, of, justice, has, dealt, with, about, 180, cases, the, icj, is, vested, with, the, power, to, make, its, own, rules, court, procedure, is, set, out, in, the, rules, of, court, of, the, international, court, of, justice, 1978, as, amended, on, 29, september, 2005, cases, before, the, icj, will, follow, a, standard, pattern, the, case, is, lodged, by, the, applicant, which, files, a, written, memorial, setting, out, the, basis, of, the, court, s, jurisdiction, and, the, merits, of, its, claim, the, respondent, may, accept, the, court, s, jurisdiction, and, file, its, own, memorial, on, the, merits, of, the, case, a, respondent, that, does, not, wish, to, submit, to, the, jurisdiction, of, the, court, may, raise, preliminary, objections, any, such, objections, must, be, ruled, upon, before, the, court, can, address, the, merits, of, the, applicant, s, claim, often, a, separate, public, hearing, is, held, on, the, preliminary, objections, and, the, court, will, render, a, judgment, respondents, normally, file, preliminary, objections, to, the, jurisdiction, of, the, court, and, or, the, admissibility, of, the, case, inadmissibility, refers, to, a, range, of, arguments, about, factors, the, court, should, take, into, account, in, deciding, jurisdiction, such, as, the, fact, that, the, issue, is, not, justiciable, or, that, it, is, not, a, legal, dispute, in, addition, objections, may, be, made, because, all, necessary, parties, are, not, before, the, court, if, the, case, necessarily, requires, the, court, to, rule, on, the, rights, and, obligations, of, a, state, that, has, not, consented, to, the, court, s, jurisdiction, the, court, does, not, proceed, to, issue, a, judgment, on, the, merits, if, the, court, decides, it, has, jurisdiction, and, the, case, is, admissible, the, respondent, then, is, required, to, file, a, memorial, addressing, the, merits, of, the, applicant, s, claim, once, all, written, arguments, are, filed, the, court, holds, a, public, hearing, on, the, merits, once, a, case, has, been, filed, any, party, usually, the, applicant, may, seek, an, order, from, the, court, to, protect, the, status, quo, pending, the, hearing, of, the, case, such, orders, are, known, as, provisional, or, interim, measures, and, are, analogous, to, interlocutory, injunctions, in, united, states, law, article, 41, of, the, statute, allows, the, court, to, make, such, orders, the, court, must, be, satisfied, to, have, prima, facie, jurisdiction, to, hear, the, merits, of, the, case, before, it, grants, provisional, measures, in, cases, in, which, a, third, state, s, interests, are, affected, that, state, may, be, permitted, to, intervene, in, the, case, and, participate, as, a, full, party, under, article, 62, a, state, with, an, interest, of, a, legal, nature, may, apply, however, it, is, within, the, court, s, discretion, whether, or, not, to, allow, the, intervention, intervention, applications, are, rare, and, the, first, successful, application, occurred, only, in, 1991, once, deliberation, has, taken, place, the, court, issues, a, majority, opinion, individual, judges, may, issue, concurring, opinions, if, they, agree, with,

party, may, ask, for, the, court, to, clarify, if, there, is, a, dispute, as, to, the, meaning, or, scope, of, the, court, s, judgment, the, international, court, has, been, criticized, with, respect, to, its, rulings, its, procedures, and, its, authority, as, with, criticisms, of, the, united, nations, many, critics, and, opponents, of, the, court, refer, to, the, general, authority, assigned, to,
