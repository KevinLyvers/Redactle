note, varies, by, jurisdiction, note, varies, by, jurisdiction, euthanasia, from, greek, lit, good, death, eu, well, good, thanatos, death, is, the, practice, of, intentionally, ending, life, to, eliminate, pain, and, suffering, different, countries, have, different, euthanasia, laws, the, british, house, of, lords, select, committee, on, medical, ethics, defines, euthanasia, as, a, deliberate, intervention, undertaken, with, the, express, intention, of, ending, a, life, to, relieve, intractable, suffering, in, the, netherlands, and, belgium, euthanasia, is, understood, as, termination, of, life, by, a, doctor, at, the, request, of, a, patient, the, dutch, law, however, does, not, use, the, term, euthanasia, but, includes, the, concept, under, the, broader, definition, of, assisted, suicide, and, termination, of, life, on, request, euthanasia, is, categorised, in, different, ways, which, include, voluntary, non, voluntary, and, involuntary, voluntary, euthanasia, is, when, a, person, wishes, to, have, their, life, ended, and, is, legal, in, a, growing, number, of, countries, non, voluntary, euthanasia, occurs, when, a, patient, s, consent, is, unavailable, and, is, legal, in, some, countries, under, certain, limited, conditions, in, both, active, and, passive, forms, involuntary, euthanasia, which, is, done, without, asking, for, consent, or, against, the, patient, s, will, is, illegal, in, all, countries, and, is, usually, considered, murder, as, of, 2006, euthanasia, had, become, the, most, active, area, of, research, in, bioethics, in, some, countries, divisive, public, controversy, occurs, over, the, moral, ethical, and, legal, issues, associated, with, euthanasia, passive, euthanasia, known, as, pulling, the, plug, is, legal, under, some, circumstances, in, many, countries, active, euthanasia, however, is, legal, or, de, facto, legal, in, only, a, handful, of, countries, for, example, belgium, canada, and, switzerland, which, limit, it, to, specific, circumstances, and, require, the, approval, of, counsellors, doctors, or, other, specialists, in, some, countries, such, as, nigeria, saudi, arabia, and, pakistan, support, for, active, euthanasia, is, almost, nonexistent, like, other, terms, borrowed, from, history, euthanasia, has, had, different, meanings, depending, on, usage, the, first, apparent, usage, of, the, term, euthanasia, belongs, to, the, historian, suetonius, who, described, how, the, emperor, augustus, dying, quickly, and, without, suffering, in, the, arms, of, his, wife, livia, experienced, the, euthanasia, he, had, wished, for, the, word, euthanasia, was, first, used, in, a, medical, context, by, francis, bacon, in, the, 17th, century, to, refer, to, an, easy, painless, happy, death, during, which, it, was, a, physician, s, responsibility, to, alleviate, the, physical, sufferings, of, the, body, bacon, referred, to, an, outward, euthanasia, the, term, outward, he, used, to, distinguish, from, a, spiritual, concept, the, euthanasia, which, regards, the, preparation, of, the, soul, in, current, usage, euthanasia, has, been, defined, as, the, painless, inducement, of, a, quick, death, however, it, is, argued, that, this, approach, fails, to, properly, define, euthanasia, as, it, leaves, open, a, number, of, possible, actions, that, would, meet, the, requirements, of, the, definition, but, would, not, be, seen, as, euthanasia, in, particular, these, include, situations, where, a, person, kills, another, painlessly, but, for, no, reason, beyond, that, of, personal, gain, or, accidental, deaths, that, are, quick, and, painless, but, not, intentional, another, approach, incorporates, the, notion, of, suffering, into, the, definition, the, definition, offered, by, the, oxford, english, dictionary, incorporates, suffering, as, a, necessary, condition, with, the, painless, killing, of, a, patient, suffering, from, an, incurable, and, painful, disease, or, in, an, irreversible, coma, this, approach, is, included, in, marvin, khol, and, paul, kurtz, s, definition, of, it, as, a, mode, or, act, of, inducing, or, permitting, death, painlessly, as, a, relief, from, suffering, counterexamples, can, be, given, such, definitions, may, encompass, killing, a, person, suffering, from, an, incurable, disease, for, personal, gain, such, as, to, claim, an, inheritance, and, commentators, such, as, tom, beauchamp, and, arnold, davidson, have, argued, that, doing, so, would, constitute, murder, simpliciter, rather, than, euthanasia, the, third, element, incorporated, into, many, definitions, is, that, of, intentionality, the, death, must, be, intended, rather, than, accidental, and, the, intent, of, the, action, must, be, a, merciful, death, michael, wreen, argued, that, the, principal, thing, that, distinguishes, euthanasia, from, intentional, killing, simpliciter, is, the, agent, s, motive, it, must, be, a, good, motive, insofar, as, the, good, of, the, person, killed, is, concerned, similarly, heather, draper, speaks, to, the, importance, of, motive, arguing, that, the, motive, forms, a, crucial, part, of, arguments, for, euthanasia, because, it, must, be, in, the, best, interests, of, the, person, on, the, receiving, end, definitions, such, as, those, offered, by, the, house, of, lords, select, committee, on, medical, ethics, take, this, path, where, euthanasia, is, defined, as, a, deliberate, intervention, undertaken, with, the, express, intention, of, ending, a, life, to, relieve, intractable, suffering, beauchamp, and, davidson, also, highlight, baruch, brody, s, an, act, of, euthanasia, is, one, in, which, one, person, a, kills, another, person, b, for, the, benefit, of, the, second, person, who, actually, does, benefit, from, being, killed, draper, argued, that, any, definition, of, euthanasia, must, incorporate, four, elements, an, agent, and, a, subject, an, intention, causal, proximity, such, that, the, actions, of, the, agent, lead, to, the, outcome, and, an, outcome, based, on, this, she, offered, a, definition, incorporating, those, elements, stating, that, euthanasia, must, be, defined, as, death, that, results, from, the, intention, of, one, person, to, kill, another, person, using, the, most, gentle, and, painless, means, possible, that, is, motivated, solely, by, the, best, interests, of, the, person, who, dies, prior, to, draper, beauchamp, and, davidson, had, also, offered, a, definition, that, included, these, elements, their, definition, specifically, discounts, fetuses, to, distinguish, between, abortions, and, euthanasia, in, summary, we, have, argued, that, the, death, of, a, human, being, a, is, an, instance, of, euthanasia, if, and, only, if, 1, a, s, death, is, intended, by, at, least, one, other, human, being, b, where, b, is, either, the, cause, of, death, or, a, causally, relevant, feature, of, the, event, resulting, in, death, whether, by, action, or, by, omission, 2, there, is, either, sufficient, current, evidence, for, b, to, believe, that, a, is, acutely, suffering, or, irreversibly, comatose, or, there, is, sufficient, current, evidence, related, to, a, s, present, condition, such, that, one, or, more, known, causal, laws, supports, b, s, belief, that, a, will, be, in, a, condition, of, acute, suffering, or, irreversible, comatoseness, 3, a, b, s, primary, reason, for, intending, a, s, death, is, cessation, of, a, s, actual, or, predicted, future, suffering, or, irreversible, comatoseness, where, b, does, not, intend, a, s, death, for, a, different, primary, reason, though, there, may, be, other, relevant, reasons, and, b, there, is, sufficient, current, evidence, for, either, a, or, b, that, causal, means, to, a, s, death, will, not, produce, any, more, suffering, than, would, be, produced, for, a, if, b, were, not, to, intervene, 4, the, causal, means, to, the, event, of, a, s, death, are, chosen, by, a, or, b, to, be, as, painless, as, possible, unless, either, a, or, b, has, an, overriding, reason, for, a, more, painful, causal, means, where, the, reason, for, choosing, the, latter, causal, means, does, not, conflict, with, the, evidence, in, 3b, 5, a, is, a, nonfetal, organism, wreen, in, part, responding, to, beauchamp, and, davidson, offered, a, six, part, definition, person, a, committed, an, act, of, euthanasia, if, and, only, if, 1, a, killed, b, or, let, her, die, 2, a, intended, to, kill, b, 3, the, intention, specified, in, 2, was, at, least, partial, cause, of, the, action, specified, in, 1, 4, the, causal, journey, from, the, intention, specified, in, 2, to, the, action, specified, in, 1, is, more, or, less, in, accordance, with, a, s, plan, of, action, 5, a, s, killing, of, b, is, a, voluntary, action, 6, the, motive, for, the, action, specified, in, 1, the, motive, standing, behind, the, intention, specified, in, 2, is, the, good, of, the, person, killed, wreen, also, considered, a, seventh, requirement, 7, the, good, specified, in, 6, is, or, at, least, includes, the, avoidance, of, evil, although, as, wreen, noted, in, the, paper, he, was, not, convinced, that, the, restriction, was, required, in, discussing, his, definition, wreen, noted, the, difficulty, of, justifying, euthanasia, when, faced, with, the, notion, of, the, subject, s, right, to, life, in, response, wreen, argued, that, euthanasia, has, to, be, voluntary, and, that, involuntary, euthanasia, is, as, such, a, great, wrong, other, commentators, incorporate, consent, more, directly, into, their, definitions, for, example, in, a, discussion, of, euthanasia, presented, in, 2003, by, the, european, association, of, palliative, care, epac, ethics, task, force, the, authors, offered, medicalized, killing, of, a, person, without, the, person, s, consent, whether, nonvoluntary, where, the, person, is, unable, to, consent, or, involuntary, against, the, person, s, will, is, not, euthanasia, it, is, murder, hence, euthanasia, can, be, voluntary, only, although, the, epac, ethics, task, force, argued, that, both, non, voluntary, and, involuntary, euthanasia, could, not, be, included, in, the, definition, of, euthanasia, there, is, discussion, in, the, literature, about, excluding, one, but, not, the, other, euthanasia, may, be, classified, into, three, types, according, to, whether, a, person, gives, informed, consent, voluntary, non, voluntary, and, involuntary, there, is, a, debate, within, the, medical, and, bioethics, literature, about, whether, or, not, the, non, voluntary, and, by, extension, involuntary, killing, of, patients, can, be, regarded, as, euthanasia, irrespective, of, intent, or, the, patient, s, circumstances, in, the, definitions, offered, by, beauchamp, and, davidson, and, later, by, wreen, consent, on, the, part, of, the, patient, was, not, considered, one, of, their, criteria, although, it, may, have, been, required, to, justify, euthanasia, however, others, see, consent, as, essential, voluntary, euthanasia, is, conducted, with, the, consent, of, the, patient, active, voluntary, euthanasia, is, legal, in, belgium, luxembourg, and, the, netherlands, passive, voluntary, euthanasia, is, legal, throughout, the, us, per, cruzan, v, director, missouri, department, of, health, when, the, patient, brings, about, their, own, death, with, the, assistance, of, a, physician, the, term, assisted, suicide, is, often, used, instead, assisted, suicide, is, legal, in, switzerland, and, the, u, s, states, of, california, oregon, washington, montana, and, vermont, non, voluntary, euthanasia, is, conducted, when, the, consent, of, the, patient, is, unavailable, examples, include, child, euthanasia, which, is, illegal, worldwide, but, decriminalised, under, certain, specific, circumstances, in, the, netherlands, under, the, groningen, protocol, passive, forms, of, non, voluntary, euthanasia, i, e, withholding, treatment, are, legal, in, a, number, of, countries, under, specified, conditions, involuntary, euthanasia, is, conducted, against, the, will, of, the, patient, voluntary, non, voluntary, and, involuntary, types, can, be, further, divided, into, passive, or, active, variants, passive, euthanasia, entails, the, withholding, treatment, necessary, for, the, continuance, of, life, active, euthanasia, entails, the, use, of, lethal, substances, or, forces, such, as, administering, a, lethal, injection, and, is, more, controversial, while, some, authors, consider, these, terms, to, be, misleading, and, unhelpful, they, are, nonetheless, commonly, used, in, some, cases, such, as, the, administration, of, increasingly, necessary, but, toxic, doses, of, painkillers, there, is, a, debate, whether, or, not, to, regard, the, practice, as, active, or, passive, euthanasia, was, practiced, in, ancient, greece, and, rome, for, example, hemlock, was, employed, as, a, means, of, hastening, death, on, the, island, of, kea, a, technique, also, employed, in, massalia, euthanasia, in, the, sense, of, the, deliberate, hastening, of, a, person, s, death, was, supported, by, socrates, plato, and, seneca, the, elder, in, the, ancient, world, although, hippocrates, appears, to, have, spoken, against, the, practice, writing, i, will, not, prescribe, a, deadly, drug, to, please, someone, nor, give, advice, that, may, cause, his, death, noting, there, is, some, debate, in, the, literature, about, whether, or, not, this, was, intended, to, encompass, euthanasia, the, term, euthanasia, in, the, earlier, sense, of, supporting, someone, as, they, died, was, used, for, the, first, time, by, francis, bacon, in, his, work, euthanasia, medica, he, chose, this, ancient, greek, word, and, in, doing, so, distinguished, between, euthanasia, interior, the, preparation, of, the, soul, for, death, and, euthanasia, exterior, which, was, intended, to, make, the, end, of, life, easier, and, painless, in, exceptional, circumstances, by, shortening, life, that, the, ancient, meaning, of, an, easy, death, came, to, the, fore, again, in, the, early, modern, period, can, be, seen, from, its, definition, in, the, 18th, century, zedlers, universallexikon, euthanasia, a, very, gentle, and, quiet, death, which, happens, without, painful, convulsions, the, word, comes, from, bene, well, and, mors, death, the, concept, of, euthanasia, in, the, sense, of, alleviating, the, process, of, death, goes, back, to, the, medical, historian, karl, friedrich, heinrich, marx, who, drew, on, bacon, s, philosophical, ideas, according, to, marx, a, doctor, had, a, moral, duty, to, ease, the, suffering, of, death, through, encouragement, support, and, mitigation, using, medication, such, an, alleviation, of, death, reflected, the, contemporary, zeitgeist, but, was, brought, into, the, medical, canon, of, responsibility, for, the, first, time, by, marx, marx, also, stressed, the, distinction, of, the, theological, care, of, the, soul, of, sick, people, from, the, physical, care, and, medical, treatment, by, doctors, euthanasia, in, its, modern, sense, has, always, been, strongly, opposed, in, the, judeo, christian, tradition, thomas, aquinas, opposed, both, and, argued, that, the, practice, of, euthanasia, contradicted, our, natural, human, instincts, of, survival, as, did, francois, ranchin, 1565, 1641, a, french, physician, and, professor, of, medicine, and, michael, boudewijns, 1601, 1681, a, physician, and, teacher, 208, other, voices, argued, for, euthanasia, such, as, john, donne, in, 1624, and, euthanasia, continued, to, be, practised, in, 1678, the, publication, of, caspar, questel, s, de, pulvinari, morientibus, non, subtrahend, on, the, pillow, of, which, the, dying, should, not, be, deprived, initiated, debate, on, the, topic, questel, described, various, customs, which, were, employed, at, the, time, to, hasten, the, death, of, the, dying, including, the, sudden, removal, of, a, pillow, which, was, believed, to, accelerate, death, and, argued, against, their, use, as, doing, so, was, against, the, laws, of, god, and, nature, 209, 211, this, view, was, shared, by, others, who, followed, including, philipp, jakob, spener, veit, riedlin, and, johann, georg, kr, nitz, 211, despite, opposition, euthanasia, continued, to, be, practised, involving, techniques, such, as, bleeding, suffocation, and, removing, people, from, their, beds, to, be, placed, on, the, cold, ground, 211, 214, suicide, and, euthanasia, became, more, accepted, during, the, age, of, enlightenment, thomas, more, wrote, of, euthanasia, in, utopia, although, it, is, not, clear, if, more, was, intending, to, endorse, the, practice, 208, 209, other, cultures, have, taken, different, approaches, for, example, in, japan, suicide, has, not, traditionally, been, viewed, as, a, sin, as, it, is, used, in, cases, of, honor, and, accordingly, the, perceptions, of, euthanasia, are, different, from, those, in, other, parts, of, the, world, in, the, mid, 1800s, the, use, of, morphine, to, treat, the, pains, of, death, emerged, with, john, warren, recommending, its, use, in, 1848, a, similar, use, of, chloroform, was, revealed, by, joseph, bullar, in, 1866, however, in, neither, case, was, it, recommended, that, the, use, should, be, to, hasten, death, in, 1870, samuel, williams, a, schoolteacher, initiated, the, contemporary, euthanasia, debate, through, a, speech, given, at, the, birmingham, speculative, club, in, england, which, was, subsequently, published, in, a, one, off, publication, entitled, essays, of, the, birmingham, speculative, club, the, collected, works, of, a, number, of, members, of, an, amateur, philosophical, society, 794, williams, proposal, was, to, use, chloroform, to, deliberately, hasten, the, death, of, terminally, ill, patients, that, in, all, cases, of, hopeless, and, painful, illness, it, should, be, the, recognized, duty, of, the, medical, attendant, whenever, so, desired, by, the, patient, to, administer, chloroform, or, such, other, anaesthetic, as, may, by, and, bye, supersede, chloroform, so, as, to, destroy, consciousness, at, once, and, put, the, sufferer, to, a, quick, and, painless, death, all, needful, precautions, being, adopted, to, prevent, any, possible, abuse, of, such, duty, and, means, being, taken, to, establish, beyond, the, possibility, of, doubt, or, question, that, the, remedy, was, applied, at, the, express, wish, of, the, patient, the, essay, was, favourably, reviewed, in, the, saturday, review, but, an, editorial, against, the, essay, appeared, in, the, spectator, from, there, it, proved, to, be, influential, and, other, writers, came, out, in, support, of, such, views, lionel, tollemache, wrote, in, favour, of, euthanasia, as, did, annie, besant, the, essayist, and, reformer, who, later, became, involved, with, the, national, secular, society, considering, it, a, duty, to, society, to, die, voluntarily, and, painlessly, when, one, reaches, the, point, of, becoming, a, burden, popular, science, analyzed, the, issue, in, may, 1873, assessing, both, sides, of, the, argument, kemp, notes, that, at, the, time, medical, doctors, did, not, participate, in, the, discussion, it, was, essentially, a, philosophical, enterprise, tied, inextricably, to, a, number, of, objections, to, the, christian, doctrine, of, the, sanctity, of, human, life, the, rise, of, the, euthanasia, movement, in, the, united, states, coincided, with, the, so, called, gilded, age, a, time, of, social, and, technological, change, that, encompassed, an, individualistic, conservatism, that, praised, laissez, faire, economics, scientific, method, and, rationalism, along, with, major, depressions, industrialisation, and, conflict, between, corporations, and, labour, unions, 794, it, was, also, the, period, in, which, the, modern, hospital, system, was, developed, which, has, been, seen, as, a, factor, in, the, emergence, of, the, euthanasia, debate, robert, ingersoll, argued, for, euthanasia, stating, in, 1894, that, where, someone, is, suffering, from, a, terminal, illness, such, as, terminal, cancer, they, should, have, a, right, to, end, their, pain, through, suicide, felix, adler, offered, a, similar, approach, although, unlike, ingersoll, adler, did, not, reject, religion, in, fact, he, argued, from, an, ethical, culture, framework, in, 1891, adler, argued, that, those, suffering, from, overwhelming, pain, should, have, the, right, to, commit, suicide, and, furthermore, that, it, should, be, permissible, for, a, doctor, to, assist, thus, making, adler, the, first, prominent, american, to, argue, for, suicide, in, cases, where, people, were, suffering, from, chronic, illness, both, ingersoll, and, adler, argued, for, voluntary, euthanasia, of, adults, suffering, from, terminal, ailments, dowbiggin, argues, that, by, breaking, down, prior, moral, objections, to, euthanasia, and, suicide, ingersoll, and, adler, enabled, others, to, stretch, the, definition, of, euthanasia, the, first, attempt, to, legalise, euthanasia, took, place, in, the, united, states, when, henry, hunt, introduced, legislation, into, the, general, assembly, of, ohio, in, 1906, 614, hunt, did, so, at, the, behest, of, anna, sophina, hall, a, wealthy, heiress, who, was, a, major, figure, in, the, euthanasia, movement, during, the, early, 20th, century, in, the, united, states, hall, had, watched, her, mother, die, after, an, extended, battle, with, liver, cancer, and, had, dedicated, herself, to, ensuring, that, others, would, not, have, to, endure, the, same, suffering, towards, this, end, she, engaged, in, an, extensive, letter, writing, campaign, recruited, lurana, sheldon, and, maud, ballington, booth, and, organised, a, debate, on, euthanasia, at, the, annual, meeting, of, the, american, humane, association, in, 1905, described, by, jacob, appel, as, the, first, significant, public, debate, on, the, topic, in, the, 20th, century, 614, 616, hunt, s, bill, called, for, the, administration, of, an, anesthetic, to, bring, about, a, patient, s, death, so, long, as, the, person, is, of, lawful, age, and, sound, mind, and, was, suffering, from, a, fatal, injury, an, irrevocable, illness, or, great, physical, pain, it, also, required, that, the, case, be, heard, by, a, physician, required, informed, consent, in, front, of, three, witnesses, and, required, the, attendance, of, three, physicians, who, had, to, agree, that, the, patient, s, recovery, was, impossible, a, motion, to, reject, the, bill, outright, was, voted, down, but, the, bill, failed, to, pass, 79, to, 23, 796, 618, 619, along, with, the, ohio, euthanasia, proposal, in, 1906, assemblyman, ross, gregory, introduced, a, proposal, to, permit, euthanasia, to, the, iowa, legislature, however, the, iowa, legislation, was, broader, in, scope, than, that, offered, in, ohio, it, allowed, for, the, death, of, any, person, of, at, least, ten, years, of, age, who, suffered, from, an, ailment, that, would, prove, fatal, and, cause, extreme, pain, should, they, be, of, sound, mind, and, express, a, desire, to, artificially, hasten, their, death, in, addition, it, allowed, for, infants, to, be, euthanised, if, they, were, sufficiently, deformed, and, permitted, guardians, to, request, euthanasia, on, behalf, of, their, wards, the, proposed, legislation, also, imposed, penalties, on, physicians, who, refused, to, perform, euthanasia, when, requested, a, 6, 12, month, prison, term, and, a, fine, of, between, 200, and, 1, 000, the, proposal, proved, to, be, controversial, 619, 621, it, engendered, considerable, debate, and, failed, to, pass, having, been, withdrawn, from, consideration, after, being, passed, to, the, committee, on, public, health, 623, after, 1906, the, euthanasia, debate, reduced, in, intensity, resurfacing, periodically, but, not, returning, to, the, same, level, of, debate, until, the, 1930s, in, the, united, kingdom, 796, euthanasia, opponent, ian, dowbiggin, argues, that, the, early, membership, of, the, euthanasia, society, of, america, esa, reflected, how, many, perceived, euthanasia, at, the, time, often, seeing, it, as, a, eugenics, matter, rather, than, an, issue, concerning, individual, rights, dowbiggin, argues, that, not, every, eugenist, joined, the, esa, solely, for, eugenic, reasons, but, he, postulates, that, there, were, clear, ideological, connections, between, the, eugenics, and, euthanasia, movements, the, voluntary, euthanasia, legalisation, society, was, founded, in, 1935, by, charles, killick, millard, now, called, dignity, in, dying, the, movement, campaigned, for, the, legalisation, of, euthanasia, in, great, britain, in, january, 1936, king, george, v, was, given, a, fatal, dose, of, morphine, and, cocaine, to, hasten, his, death, at, the, time, he, was, suffering, from, cardio, respiratory, failure, and, the, decision, to, end, his, life, was, made, by, his, physician, lord, dawson, although, this, event, was, kept, a, secret, for, over, 50, years, the, death, of, george, v, coincided, with, proposed, legislation, in, the, house, of, lords, to, legalise, euthanasia, a, 24, july, 1939, killing, of, a, severely, disabled, infant, in, nazi, germany, was, described, in, a, bbc, genocide, under, the, nazis, timeline, as, the, first, state, sponsored, euthanasia, parties, that, consented, to, the, killing, included, hitler, s, office, the, parents, and, the, reich, committee, for, the, scientific, registration, of, serious, and, congenitally, based, illnesses, the, telegraph, noted, that, the, killing, of, the, disabled, infant, whose, name, was, gerhard, kretschmar, born, blind, with, missing, limbs, subject, to, convulsions, and, reportedly, an, idiot, provided, the, rationale, for, a, secret, nazi, decree, that, led, to, mercy, killings, of, almost, 300, 000, mentally, and, physically, handicapped, people, while, kretchmar, s, killing, received, parental, consent, most, of, the, 5, 000, to, 8, 000, children, killed, afterwards, were, forcibly, taken, from, their, parents, the, euthanasia, campaign, of, mass, murder, gathered, momentum, on, 14, january, 1940, when, the, handicapped, were, killed, with, gas, vans, and, at, killing, centres, eventually, leading, to, the, deaths, of, 70, 000, adult, germans, professor, robert, jay, lifton, author, of, the, nazi, doctors, and, a, leading, authority, on, the, t4, program, contrasts, this, program, with, what, he, considers, to, be, a, genuine, euthanasia, he, explains, that, the, nazi, version, of, euthanasia, was, based, on, the, work, of, adolf, jost, who, published, the, right, to, death, das, recht, auf, den, tod, in, 1895, lifton, writes, jost, argued, that, control, over, the, death, of, the, individual, must, ultimately, belong, to, the, social, organism, the, state, this, concept, is, in, direct, opposition, to, the, anglo, american, concept, of, euthanasia, which, emphasizes, the, individual, s, right, to, die, or, right, to, death, or, right, to, his, or, her, own, death, as, the, ultimate, human, claim, in, contrast, jost, was, pointing, to, the, state, s, right, to, kill, ultimately, the, argument, was, biological, the, rights, to, death, the, key, to, the, fitness, of, life, the, state, must, own, death, must, kill, in, order, to, keep, the, social, organism, alive, and, healthy, in, modern, terms, the, use, of, euthanasia, in, the, context, of, action, t4, is, seen, to, be, a, euphemism, to, disguise, a, program, of, genocide, in, which, people, were, killed, on, the, grounds, of, disabilities, religious, beliefs, and, discordant, individual, values, compared, to, the, discussions, of, euthanasia, that, emerged, post, war, the, nazi, program, may, have, been, worded, in, terms, that, appear, similar, to, the, modern, use, of, euthanasia, but, there, was, no, mercy, and, the, patients, were, not, necessarily, terminally, ill, despite, these, differences, historian, and, euthanasia, opponent, ian, dowbiggin, writes, that, the, origins, of, nazi, euthanasia, like, those, of, the, american, euthanasia, movement, predate, the, third, reich, and, were, intertwined, with, the, history, of, eugenics, and, social, darwinism, and, with, efforts, to, discredit, traditional, morality, and, ethics, 65, on, 6, january, 1949, the, euthanasia, society, of, america, presented, to, the, new, york, state, legislature, a, petition, to, legalize, euthanasia, signed, by, 379, leading, protestant, and, jewish, ministers, the, largest, group, of, religious, leaders, ever, to, have, taken, this, stance, a, similar, petition, had, been, sent, to, the, new, york, legislature, in, 1947, signed, by, approximately, 1, 000, new, york, physicians, roman, catholic, religious, leaders, criticized, the, petition, saying, that, such, a, bill, would, legalize, a, suicide, murder, pact, and, a, rationalization, of, the, fifth, commandment, of, god, thou, shalt, not, kill, the, right, reverend, robert, e, mccormick, stated, that, the, ultimate, object, of, the, euthanasia, society, is, based, on, the, totalitarian, principle, that, the, state, is, supreme, and, that, the, individual, does, not, have, the, right, to, live, if, his, continuance, in, life, is, a, burden, or, hindrance, to, the, state, the, nazis, followed, this, principle, and, compulsory, euthanasia, was, practiced, as, a, part, of, their, program, during, the, recent, war, we, american, citizens, of, new, york, state, must, ask, ourselves, this, question, are, we, going, to, finish, hitler, s, job, the, petition, brought, tensions, between, the, american, euthanasia, society, and, the, catholic, church, to, a, head, that, contributed, to, a, climate, of, anti, catholic, sentiment, generally, regarding, issues, such, as, birth, control, eugenics, and, population, control, however, the, petition, did, not, result, in, any, legal, changes, historically, the, euthanasia, debate, has, tended, to, focus, on, a, number, of, key, concerns, according, to, euthanasia, opponent, ezekiel, emanuel, proponents, of, euthanasia, have, presented, four, main, arguments, a, that, people, have, a, right, to, self, determination, and, thus, should, be, allowed, to, choose, their, own, fate, b, assisting, a, subject, to, die, might, be, a, better, choice, than, requiring, that, they, continue, to, suffer, c, the, distinction, between, passive, euthanasia, which, is, often, permitted, and, active, euthanasia, which, is, not, substantive, or, that, the, underlying, principle, the, doctrine, of, double, effect, is, unreasonable, or, unsound, and, d, permitting, euthanasia, will, not, necessarily, lead, to, unacceptable, consequences, pro, euthanasia, activists, often, point, to, countries, like, the, netherlands, and, belgium, and, states, like, oregon, where, euthanasia, has, been, legalized, to, argue, that, it, is, mostly, unproblematic, similarly, emanuel, argues, that, there, are, four, major, arguments, presented, by, opponents, of, euthanasia, a, not, all, deaths, are, painful, b, alternatives, such, as, cessation, of, active, treatment, combined, with, the, use, of, effective, pain, relief, are, available, c, the, distinction, between, active, and, passive, euthanasia, is, morally, significant, and, d, legalising, euthanasia, will, place, society, on, a, slippery, slope, which, will, lead, to, unacceptable, consequences, 797, 8, in, fact, in, oregon, in, 2013, pain, was, not, one, of, the, top, five, reasons, people, sought, euthanasia, top, reasons, were, a, loss, of, dignity, and, a, fear, of, burdening, others, in, the, united, states, in, 2013, 47, nationwide, supported, doctor, assisted, suicide, this, included, 32, of, latinos, 29, of, african, americans, some, u, s, disability, rights, organizations, have, also, opposed, bills, legalizing, assisted, suicide, a, 2015, populus, poll, in, the, united, kingdom, found, broad, public, support, for, assisted, dying, 82, of, people, supported, the, introduction, of, assisted, dying, laws, including, 86, of, people, with, disabilities, an, alternative, approach, to, the, question, is, seen, in, the, hospice, movement, which, promotes, palliative, care, for, the, dying, and, terminally, ill, this, has, pioneered, the, use, of, pain, relieving, drugs, in, a, holistic, atmosphere, in, which, the, patient, s, spiritual, care, ranks, alongside, physical, care, it, intends, neither, to, hasten, nor, postpone, death, eligibility, for, euthanasia, varies, across, jurisdictions, where, it, is, legal, some, countries, such, as, belgium, and, the, netherlands, allow, euthanasia, for, mental, illness, west, s, encyclopedia, of, american, law, states, that, a, mercy, killing, or, euthanasia, is, generally, considered, to, be, a, criminal, homicide, and, is, normally, used, as, a, synonym, of, homicide, committed, at, a, request, made, by, the, patient, the, judicial, sense, of, the, term, homicide, includes, any, intervention, undertaken, with, the, express, intention, of, ending, a, life, even, to, relieve, intractable, suffering, not, all, homicide, is, unlawful, two, designations, of, homicide, that, carry, no, criminal, punishment, are, justifiable, and, excusable, homicide, in, most, countries, this, is, not, the, status, of, euthanasia, the, term, euthanasia, is, usually, confined, to, the, active, variety, the, university, of, washington, website, states, that, euthanasia, generally, means, that, the, physician, would, act, directly, for, instance, by, giving, a, lethal, injection, to, end, the, patient, s, life, physician, assisted, suicide, is, thus, not, classified, as, euthanasia, by, the, us, state, of, oregon, where, it, is, legal, under, the, oregon, death, with, dignity, act, and, despite, its, name, it, is, not, legally, classified, as, suicide, either, unlike, physician, assisted, suicide, withholding, or, withdrawing, life, sustaining, treatments, with, patient, consent, voluntary, is, almost, unanimously, considered, at, least, in, the, united, states, to, be, legal, the, use, of, pain, medication, to, relieve, suffering, even, if, it, hastens, death, has, been, held, as, legal, in, several, court, decisions, some, governments, around, the, world, have, legalized, voluntary, euthanasia, but, most, commonly, it, is, still, considered, to, be, criminal, homicide, in, the, netherlands, and, belgium, where, euthanasia, has, been, legalized, it, still, remains, homicide, although, it, is, not, prosecuted, and, not, punishable, if, the, perpetrator, the, doctor, meets, certain, legal, conditions, in, a, historic, judgment, the, supreme, court, of, india, legalized, passive, euthanasia, the, apex, court, remarked, in, the, judgement, that, the, constitution, of, india, values, liberty, dignity, autonomy, and, privacy, a, bench, headed, by, chief, justice, dipak, misra, delivered, a, unanimous, judgment, a, 2010, survey, in, the, united, states, of, more, than, 10, 000, physicians, found, that, 16, 3, of, physicians, would, consider, halting, life, sustaining, therapy, because, the, family, demanded, it, even, if, they, believed, that, it, was, premature, approximately, 54, 5, would, not, and, the, remaining, 29, 2, responded, it, depends, the, study, also, found, that, 45, 8, of, physicians, agreed, that, physician, assisted, suicide, should, be, allowed, in, some, cases, 40, 7, did, not, and, the, remaining, 13, 5, felt, it, depended, in, the, united, kingdom, the, assisted, dying, campaign,

assisted, suicide, as, morally, wrong, as, paragraph, 2324, of, the, catechism, of, the, catholic, church, states, intentional, euthanasia, whatever, its, forms, or, motives, is, murder, it, is, gravely, contrary, to, the, dignity, of, the, human, person, and, to, the, respect, due, to, the, living, god, his, creator, because, of, this, per, the, declaration, on, euthanasia, the, practice, is, unacceptable, within, the, church, the, orthodox, church, in, america, along, with, other, eastern, orthodox, churches, also, opposes, euthanasia, stating, that, euthanasia, is, the, deliberate, cessation, of, human, life, and, as, such, must, be, condemned, as, murder, many, non, catholic, churches, in, the, united, states, take, a, stance, against, euthanasia, among, protestant, denominations, the, episcopal, church, passed, a, resolution, in, 1991, opposing, euthanasia, and, assisted, suicide, stating, that, it, is, morally, wrong, and, unacceptable, to, take, a, human, life, to, relieve, the, suffering, caused, by, incurable, illnesses, protestant, and, other, non, catholic, churches, which, oppose, euthanasia, include, the, church, of, england, accepts, passive, euthanasia, under, some, circumstances, but, is, strongly, against, active, euthanasia, and, has, led, opposition, against, recent, attempts, to, legalise, it, the, united, church, of, canada, accepts, passive, euthanasia, under, some, circumstances, but, is, in, general, against, active, euthanasia, with, growing, acceptance, now, that, active, euthanasia, has, been, partly, legalised, in, canada, the, waldensians, take, a, liberal, stance, on, euthanasia, and, allow, the, decision, to, lie, with, individuals, euthanasia, is, a, complex, issue, in, islamic, theology, however, in, general, it, is, considered, contrary, to, islamic, law, and, holy, texts, among, interpretations, of, the, qur, an, and, hadith, the, early, termination, of, life, is, a, crime, be, it, by, suicide, or, helping, one, commit, suicide, the, various, positions, on, the, cessation, of, medical, treatment, are, mixed, and, considered, a, different, class, of, action, than, direct, termination, of, life, especially, if, the, patient, is, suffering, suicide, and, euthanasia, are, both, crimes, in, almost, all, muslim, majority, countries, there, is, much, debate, on, the, topic, of, euthanasia,
