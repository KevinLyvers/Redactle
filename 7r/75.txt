the, chemical, industry, comprises, the, companies, and, other, organizations, that, develop, and, produce, industrial, specialty, and, other, chemicals, central, to, the, modern, world, economy, it, converts, raw, materials, oil, natural, gas, air, water, metals, and, minerals, into, commodity, chemicals, for, industrial, and, consumer, products, it, includes, industries, for, petrochemicals, such, as, polymers, for, plastics, and, synthetic, fibers, inorganic, chemicals, such, as, acids, and, alkalis, agricultural, chemicals, such, as, fertilizers, pesticides, and, herbicides, and, other, categories, such, as, industrial, gases, speciality, chemicals, and, pharmaceuticals, various, professionals, are, involved, in, the, chemical, industry, including, chemical, engineers, chemists, and, lab, technicians, although, chemicals, were, made, and, used, throughout, history, the, birth, of, the, heavy, chemical, industry, production, of, chemicals, in, large, quantities, for, a, variety, of, uses, coincided, with, the, beginnings, of, the, industrial, revolution, one, of, the, first, chemicals, to, be, produced, in, large, amounts, through, industrial, processes, was, sulfuric, acid, in, 1736, pharmacist, joshua, ward, developed, a, process, for, its, production, that, involved, heating, sulfur, with, saltpeter, allowing, the, sulfur, to, oxidize, and, combine, with, water, it, was, the, first, practical, production, of, sulphuric, acid, on, a, large, scale, john, roebuck, and, samuel, garbett, were, the, first, to, establish, a, large, scale, factory, in, prestonpans, scotland, in, 1749, which, used, leaden, condensing, chambers, for, the, manufacture, of, sulfuric, acid, in, the, early, 18th, century, cloth, was, bleached, by, treating, it, with, stale, urine, or, sour, milk, and, exposing, it, to, sunlight, for, long, periods, of, time, which, created, a, severe, bottleneck, in, production, sulfuric, acid, began, to, be, used, as, a, more, efficient, agent, as, well, as, lime, by, the, middle, of, the, century, but, it, was, the, discovery, of, bleaching, powder, by, charles, tennant, that, spurred, the, creation, of, the, first, great, chemical, industrial, enterprise, his, powder, was, made, by, reacting, chlorine, with, dry, slaked, lime, and, proved, to, be, a, cheap, and, successful, product, he, opened, the, st, rollox, chemical, works, north, of, glasgow, and, production, went, from, just, 52, tons, in, 1799, to, almost, 10, 000, tons, just, five, years, later, soda, ash, was, used, since, ancient, times, in, the, production, of, glass, textile, soap, and, paper, and, the, source, of, the, potash, had, traditionally, been, wood, ashes, in, western, europe, by, the, 18th, century, this, source, was, becoming, uneconomical, due, to, deforestation, and, the, french, academy, of, sciences, offered, a, prize, of, 2400, livres, for, a, method, to, produce, alkali, from, sea, salt, sodium, chloride, the, leblanc, process, was, patented, in, 1791, by, nicolas, leblanc, who, then, built, a, leblanc, plant, at, saint, denis, he, was, denied, his, prize, money, because, of, the, french, revolution, in, britain, the, leblanc, process, became, popular, william, losh, built, the, first, soda, works, in, britain, at, the, losh, wilson, and, bell, works, on, the, river, tyne, in, 1816, but, it, remained, on, a, small, scale, due, to, large, tariffs, on, salt, production, until, 1824, when, these, tariffs, were, repealed, the, british, soda, industry, was, able, to, rapidly, expand, james, muspratt, s, chemical, works, in, liverpool, and, charles, tennant, s, complex, near, glasgow, became, the, largest, chemical, production, centres, anywhere, by, the, 1870s, the, british, soda, output, of, 200, 000, tons, annually, exceeded, that, of, all, other, nations, in, the, world, combined, these, huge, factories, began, to, produce, a, greater, diversity, of, chemicals, as, the, industrial, revolution, matured, originally, large, quantities, of, alkaline, waste, were, vented, into, the, environment, from, the, production, of, soda, provoking, one, of, the, first, pieces, of, environmental, legislation, to, be, passed, in, 1863, this, provided, for, close, inspection, of, the, factories, and, imposed, heavy, fines, on, those, exceeding, the, limits, on, pollution, methods, were, devised, to, make, useful, byproducts, from, the, alkali, the, solvay, process, was, developed, by, the, belgian, industrial, chemist, ernest, solvay, in, 1861, in, 1864, solvay, and, his, brother, alfred, constructed, a, plant, in, charleroi, belgium, in, 1874, they, expanded, into, a, larger, plant, in, nancy, france, the, new, process, proved, more, economical, and, less, polluting, than, the, leblanc, method, and, its, use, spread, in, the, same, year, ludwig, mond, visited, solvay, to, acquire, the, rights, to, use, his, process, and, he, and, john, brunner, formed, brunner, mond, co, and, built, a, solvay, plant, at, winnington, england, mond, was, instrumental, in, making, the, solvay, process, a, commercial, success, he, made, several, refinements, between, 1873, and, 1880, that, removed, byproducts, that, could, inhibit, the, production, of, sodium, carbonate, in, the, process, the, manufacture, of, chemical, products, from, fossil, fuels, began, at, scale, in, the, early, 19th, century, the, coal, tar, and, ammoniacal, liquor, residues, of, coal, gas, manufacture, for, gas, lighting, began, to, be, processed, in, 1822, at, the, bonnington, chemical, works, in, edinburgh, to, make, naphtha, pitch, oil, later, called, creosote, pitch, lampblack, carbon, black, and, sal, ammoniac, ammonium, chloride, ammonium, sulphate, fertiliser, asphalt, road, surfacing, coke, oil, and, coke, were, later, added, to, the, product, line, the, late, 19th, century, saw, an, explosion, in, both, the, quantity, of, production, and, the, variety, of, chemicals, that, were, manufactured, large, chemical, industries, arose, in, germany, and, later, in, the, united, states, production, of, artificial, manufactured, fertilizer, for, agriculture, was, pioneered, by, sir, john, lawes, at, his, purpose, built, rothamsted, research, facility, in, the, 1840s, he, established, large, works, near, london, for, the, manufacture, of, superphosphate, of, lime, processes, for, the, vulcanization, of, rubber, were, patented, by, charles, goodyear, in, the, united, states, and, thomas, hancock, in, england, in, the, 1840s, the, first, synthetic, dye, was, discovered, by, william, henry, perkin, in, london, he, partly, transformed, aniline, into, a, crude, mixture, which, when, extracted, with, alcohol, produced, a, substance, with, an, intense, purple, colour, he, also, developed, the, first, synthetic, perfumes, german, industry, quickly, began, to, dominate, the, field, of, synthetic, dyes, the, three, major, firms, basf, bayer, and, hoechst, produced, several, hundred, different, dyes, by, 1913, german, industries, produced, almost, 90, of, the, world, s, supply, of, dyestuffs, and, sold, approximately, 80, of, their, production, abroad, in, the, united, states, herbert, henry, dow, s, use, of, electrochemistry, to, produce, chemicals, from, brine, was, a, commercial, success, that, helped, to, promote, the, country, s, chemical, industry, the, petrochemical, industry, can, be, traced, back, to, the, oil, works, of, scottish, chemist, james, young, and, canadian, abraham, pineo, gesner, the, first, plastic, was, invented, by, alexander, parkes, an, english, metallurgist, in, 1856, he, patented, parkesine, a, celluloid, based, on, nitrocellulose, treated, with, a, variety, of, solvents, this, material, exhibited, at, the, 1862, london, international, exhibition, anticipated, many, of, the, modern, aesthetic, and, utility, uses, of, plastics, the, industrial, production, of, soap, from, vegetable, oils, was, started, by, william, lever, and, his, brother, james, in, 1885, in, lancashire, based, on, a, modern, chemical, process, invented, by, william, hough, watson, that, used, glycerin, and, vegetable, oils, by, the, 1920s, chemical, firms, consolidated, into, large, conglomerates, ig, farben, in, germany, rh, ne, poulenc, in, france, and, imperial, chemical, industries, in, britain, dupont, became, a, major, chemicals, firm, in, the, early, 20th, century, in, america, polymers, and, plastics, such, as, polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl, chloride, polyethylene, terephthalate, polystyrene, and, polycarbonate, comprise, about, 80, of, the, industry, s, output, worldwide, chemicals, are, used, in, many, different, consumer, goods, and, are, also, used, in, many, different, sectors, this, includes, agriculture, manufacturing, construction, and, service, industries, major, industrial, customers, include, rubber, and, plastic, products, textiles, apparel, petroleum, refining, pulp, and, paper, and, primary, metals, chemicals, are, nearly, a, 5, trillion, global, enterprise, and, the, eu, and, u, s, chemical, companies, are, the, world, s, largest, producers, sales, of, the, chemical, business, can, be, divided, into, a, few, broad, categories, including, basic, chemicals, about, 35, 37, of, dollar, output, life, sciences, 30, specialty, chemicals, 20, 25, and, consumer, products, about, 10, basic, chemicals, or, commodity, chemicals, are, a, broad, chemical, category, including, polymers, bulk, petrochemicals, and, intermediates, other, derivatives, and, basic, industrials, inorganic, chemicals, and, fertilizers, polymers, are, the, largest, revenue, segment, and, includes, all, categories, of, plastics, and, human, made, fibers, the, major, markets, for, plastics, are, packaging, followed, by, home, construction, containers, appliances, pipe, transportation, toys, and, games, principal, raw, materials, for, polymers, are, bulk, petrochemicals, like, ethylene, propylene, and, benzene, petrochemicals, and, intermediate, chemicals, are, primarily, made, from, liquefied, petroleum, gas, lpg, natural, gas, and, crude, oil, fractions, large, volume, products, include, ethylene, propylene, benzene, toluene, xylenes, methanol, vinyl, chloride, monomer, vcm, styrene, butadiene, and, ethylene, oxide, these, basic, or, commodity, chemicals, are, the, starting, materials, used, to, manufacture, many, polymers, and, other, more, complex, organic, chemicals, particularly, those, that, are, made, for, use, in, the, specialty, chemicals, category, other, derivatives, and, basic, industrials, include, synthetic, rubber, surfactants, dyes, and, pigments, turpentine, resins, carbon, black, explosives, and, rubber, products, and, contribute, about, 20, percent, of, the, basic, chemicals, external, sales, inorganic, chemicals, about, 12, of, the, revenue, output, make, up, the, oldest, of, the, chemical, categories, products, include, salt, chlorine, caustic, soda, soda, ash, acids, such, as, nitric, acid, phosphoric, acid, and, sulfuric, acid, titanium, dioxide, and, hydrogen, peroxide, fertilizers, are, the, smallest, category, about, 6,

biological, substances, pharmaceuticals, diagnostics, animal, health, products, vitamins, and, pesticides, while, much, smaller, in, volume, than, other, chemical, sectors, their, products, tend, to, have, high, prices, over, ten, dollars, per, pound, growth, rates, of, 1, 5, to, 6, times, gdp, and, research, and, development, spending, at, 15, to, 25, of, sales, life, science, products, are, usually, produced, with, high, specifications, and, are, closely, scrutinized, by, government, agencies, such, as, the, food, and, drug, administration, pesticides, also, called, crop, protection, chemicals, are, about, 10, of, this, category, and, include, herbicides, insecticides, and, fungicides, specialty, chemicals, are, a, category, of, relatively, high, valued, rapidly, growing, chemicals, with, diverse, end, product, markets, typical, growth, rates, are, one, to, three, times, gdp, with, prices, over, a, dollar, per, pound, they, are, generally, characterized, by, their, innovative, aspects, products, are, sold, for, what, they, can, do, rather, than, for, what, chemicals, they, contain, products, include, electronic, chemicals, industrial, gases, adhesives, and, sealants, as, well, as, coatings, industrial, and, institutional, cleaning, chemicals, and, catalysts, in, 2012, excluding, fine, chemicals, the, 546, billion, global, specialty, chemical, market, was, 33, paints, coating, and, surface, treatments, 27, advanced, polymer, 14, adhesives, and, sealants, 13, additives, and, 13, pigments, and, inks, speciality, chemicals, are, sold, as, effect, or, performance, chemicals, sometimes, they, are, mixtures, of, formulations, unlike, fine, chemicals, which, are, almost, always, single, molecule, products, consumer, products, include, direct, product, sales, of, chemicals, such, as, soaps, detergents, and, cosmetics, typical, growth, rates, are, 0, 8, to, 1, 0, times, gdp, consumers, rarely, come, into, contact, with, basic, chemicals, polymers, and, specialty, chemicals, are, materials, that, they, encounter, everywhere, daily, examples, are, plastics, cleaning, materials, cosmetics, paints, coatings, electronics, automobiles, and, the, materials, used, in, home, construction, these, specialty, products, are, marketed, by, chemical, companies, to, the, downstream, manufacturing, industries, as, pesticides, specialty, polymers,

for, some, companies, top, chemical, companies, by, chemical, sales, in, 2015, london, united, kingdom, from, the, perspective, of, chemical, engineers, the, chemical, industry, involves, the, use, of, chemical, processes, such, as, chemical, reactions, and, refining, methods, to, produce, a, wide, variety, of, solid, liquid, and, gaseous, materials, most, of, these, products, serve, to, manufacture, other, items, although, a, smaller, number, go, directly, to, consumers, solvents, pesticides, lye, washing, soda, and, portland, cement, provide, a, few, examples, of, products, used, by, consumers, the, industry, includes, manufacturers, of, inorganic, and, organic, industrial, chemicals, ceramic, products, petrochemicals, agrochemicals, polymers, and, rubber, elastomers, oleochemicals, oils, fats, and, waxes, explosives, fragrances, and, flavors, examples, of, these, products, are, shown, in, the, table, below, related, industries, include, petroleum, glass, paint, ink, sealant, adhesive, pharmaceuticals, and, food, processing, chemical, processes, such, as, chemical, reactions, operate, in, chemical, plants, to, form, new, substances, in, various, types, of, reaction, vessels, in, many, cases, the, reactions, take, place, in, special, corrosion, resistant, equipment, at, elevated, temperatures, and, pressures, with, the, use, of, catalysts, the, products, of, these, reactions, are, separated, using, a, variety, of, techniques, including, distillation, especially, fractional, distillation, precipitation, crystallization, adsorption, filtration, sublimation, and, drying, the, processes, and, products, or, products, are, usually, tested, during, and, after, manufacture, by, dedicated, instruments, and, on, site, quality, control, laboratories, to, ensure, safe, operation, and, to, assure, that, the, product, will, meet, required, specifications, more, organizations, within, the, industry, are, implementing, chemical, compliance, software, to, maintain, quality, products, and, manufacturing, standards, the, products, are, packaged, and, delivered, by, many, methods, including, pipelines, tank, cars, and, tank, trucks, for, both, solids, and, liquids, cylinders, drums, bottles, and, boxes, chemical, companies, often, have, a, research, and, development, laboratory, for, developing, and, testing, products, and, processes, these, facilities, may, include, pilot, plants, and, such, research, facilities, may, be, located, at, a, site, separate, from, the, production, plant, s, the, scale, of, chemical, manufacturing, tends, to, be, organized, from, largest, in, volume, petrochemicals, and, commodity, chemicals, to, specialty, chemicals, and, the, smallest, fine, chemicals, the, petrochemical, and, commodity, chemical, manufacturing, units, are, on, the, whole, single, product, continuous, processing, plants, not, all, petrochemical, or, commodity, chemical, materials, are, made, in, one, single, location, but, groups, of, related, materials, often, are, to, induce, industrial, symbiosis, as, well, as, material, energy, and, utility, efficiency, and, other, economies, of, scale, those, chemicals, made, on, the, largest, of, scales, are, made, in, a, few, manufacturing, locations, around, the, world, for, example, in, texas, and, louisiana, along, the, gulf, coast, of, the, united, states, on, teesside, united, kingdom, and, in, rotterdam, in, the, netherlands, the, large, scale, manufacturing, locations, often, have, clusters, of, manufacturing, units, that, share, utilities, and, large, scale, infrastructure, such, as, power, stations, port, facilities, and, road, and, rail, terminals, to, demonstrate, the, clustering, and, integration, mentioned, above, some, 50, of, the, united, kingdom, s, petrochemical, and, commodity, chemicals, are, produced, by, the, northeast, of, england, process, industry, cluster, on, teesside, specialty, chemical, and, fine, chemical, manufacturing, are, mostly, made, in, discrete, batch, processes, these, manufacturers, are, often, found, in, similar, locations, but, in, many, cases, they, are, to, be, found, in, multi, sector, business, parks, in, the, u, s, there, are, 170, major, chemical, companies, they, operate, internationally, with, more, than, 2, 800, facilities, outside, the, u, s, and, 1, 700, foreign, subsidiaries, or, affiliates, operating, the, u, s, chemical, output, is, 750, billion, a, year, the, u, s, industry, records, large, trade, surpluses, and, employs, more, than, a, million, people, in, the, united, states, alone, the, chemical, industry, is, also, the, second, largest, consumer, of, energy, in, manufacturing, and, spends, over, 5, billion, annually, on, pollution, abatement, in, europe, the, chemical, plastics, and, rubber, sectors, are, among, the, largest, industrial, sectors, together, they, generate, about, 3, 2, million, jobs, in, more, than, 60, 000, companies, since, 2000, the, chemical, sector, alone, has, represented, 2, 3, of, the, entire, manufacturing, trade, surplus, of, the, eu, in, 2012, the, chemical, sector, accounted, for, 12, of, the, eu, manufacturing, industry, s, added, value, europe, remains, the, world, s, biggest, chemical, trading, region, with, 43, of, the, world, s, exports, and, 37, of, the, world, s, imports, although, the, latest, data, shows, that, asia, is, catching, up, with, 34, of, the, exports, and, 37, of, imports, even, so, europe, still, has, a, trading, surplus, with, all, regions, of, the, world, except, japan, and, china, where, in, 2011, there, was, a, chemical, trade, balance, europe, s, trade, surplus, with, the, rest, of, the, world, today, amounts, to, 41, 7, billion, euros, over, the, 20, years, between, 1991, and, 2011, the, european, chemical, industry, saw, its, sales, increase, from, 295, billion, euros, to, 539, billion, euros, a, picture, of, constant, growth, despite, this, the, european, industry, s, share, of, the, world, chemical, market, has, fallen, from, 36, to, 20, this, has, resulted, from, the, huge, increase, in, production, and, sales, in, emerging, markets, like, india, and, china, the, data, suggest, that, 95, of, this, impact, is, from, china, alone, in, 2012, the, data, from, the, european, chemical, industry, council, shows, that, five, european, countries, account, for, 71, of, the, eu, s, chemicals, sales, these, are, germany, france, the, united, kingdom, italy, and, the, netherlands, the, chemical, industry, has, seen, growth, in, china, india, korea, the, middle, east, south, east, asia, nigeria, and, brazil, the, growth, is, driven, by, changes, in, feedstock, availability, and, price, labor, and, energy, costs, differential, rates, of, economic, growth, and, environmental, pressures, just, as, companies, emerge, as, the, main, producers, of, the, chemical, industry, we, can, also, look, on, a, more, global, scale, at, how, industrialized, countries, rank, with, regard, to, the, billions, of, dollars, worth, of, production, a, country, or, region, could, export, though, the, business, of, chemistry, is, worldwide, in, scope, the, bulk, of, the, world, s, 3, 7, trillion, chemical, output, is, accounted, for, by, only, a, handful, of, industrialized, nations, the, united, states, alone, produced, 689, billion, 18, 6, percent, of, the, total, world, chemical, output, in, 2008
