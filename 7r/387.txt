egyptian, hieroglyphs, h, a, r, o, l, f, s, hy, roh, glifs, were, the, formal, writing, system, used, in, ancient, egypt, for, writing, the, egyptian, language, hieroglyphs, combined, ideographic, logographic, syllabic, and, alphabetic, elements, with, more, than, 100, distinct, characters, cursive, hieroglyphs, were, used, for, religious, literature, on, papyrus, and, wood, the, later, hieratic, and, demotic, egyptian, scripts, were, derived, from, hieroglyphic, writing, as, was, the, proto, sinaitic, script, that, later, evolved, into, the, phoenician, alphabet, egyptian, hieroglyphs, are, the, ultimate, ancestor, of, the, phoenician, alphabet, the, first, widely, adopted, phonetic, writing, system, moreover, owing, in, large, part, to, the, greek, and, aramaic, scripts, that, descended, from, phoenician, the, majority, of, the, world, s, living, writing, systems, are, descendants, of, egyptian, hieroglyphs, most, prominently, the, latin, and, cyrillic, scripts, through, greek, and, the, arabic, and, brahmic, scripts, through, aramaic, the, use, of, hieroglyphic, writing, arose, from, proto, literate, symbol, systems, in, the, early, bronze, age, c, the, 33rd, century, bc, naqada, iii, with, the, first, decipherable, sentence, written, in, the, egyptian, language, dating, to, the, 28th, century, bc, second, dynasty, egyptian, hieroglyphs, developed, into, a, mature, writing, system, used, for, monumental, inscription, in, the, classical, language, of, the, middle, kingdom, period, during, this, period, the, system, used, about, 900, distinct, signs, the, use, of, this, writing, system, continued, through, the, new, kingdom, and, late, period, and, on, into, the, persian, and, ptolemaic, periods, late, survivals, of, hieroglyphic, use, are, found, well, into, the, roman, period, extending, into, the, 4th, century, ad, during, the, 5th, century, the, permanent, closing, of, pagan, temples, across, roman, egypt, ultimately, resulted, in, the, ability, to, read, and, write, hieroglyphics, being, forgotten, despite, attempts, at, decipherment, the, nature, of, the, script, remained, unknown, throughout, the, middle, ages, and, the, early, modern, period, the, decipherment, of, hieroglyphic, writing, was, finally, accomplished, in, the, 1820s, by, jean, fran, ois, champollion, with, the, help, of, the, rosetta, stone, the, entire, ancient, egyptian, corpus, including, both, hieroglyphic, and, hieratic, texts, is, approximately, 5, million, words, in, length, if, counting, duplicates, such, as, the, book, of, the, dead, and, the, coffin, texts, as, separate, this, figure, is, closer, to, 10, million, the, most, complete, compendium, of, ancient, egyptian, the, w, rterbuch, der, gyptischen, sprache, contains, 1, 5, 1, 7, million, words, the, word, hieroglyph, comes, from, the, greek, adjective, hieroglyphikos, a, compound, of, hier, s, sacred, and, gl, ph, carve, engrave, see, glyph, meaning, sacred, carving, the, glyphs, themselves, since, the, ptolemaic, period, were, called, t, hieroglyphik, the, sacred, engraved, letters, the, greek, counterpart, to, the, egyptian, expression, of, mdw, w, n, r, god, s, words, greek, meant, a, carver, of, hieroglyphs, in, english, hieroglyph, as, a, noun, is, recorded, from, 1590, originally, short, for, nominalized, hieroglyphic, 1580s, with, a, plural, hieroglyphics, from, adjectival, use, hieroglyphic, character, the, nag, hammadi, texts, written, in, sahidic, coptic, call, the, hieroglyphs, writings, of, the, magicians, soothsayers, coptic, hieroglyphs, may, have, emerged, from, the, preliterate, artistic, traditions, of, egypt, for, example, symbols, on, gerzean, pottery, from, c, 4000, bc, have, been, argued, to, resemble, hieroglyphic, writing, proto, writing, systems, developed, in, the, second, half, of, the, 4th, millennium, bc, such, as, the, clay, labels, of, a, predynastic, ruler, called, scorpion, i, naqada, iiia, period, c, 33rd, century, bc, recovered, at, abydos, modern, umm, el, qa, ab, in, 1998, or, the, narmer, palette, c, 31st, century, bc, the, first, full, sentence, written, in, mature, hieroglyphs, so, far, discovered, was, found, on, a, seal, impression, in, the, tomb, of, seth, peribsen, at, umm, el, qa, ab, which, dates, from, the, second, dynasty, 28th, or, 27th, century, bc, around, 800, hieroglyphs, are, known, to, date, back, to, the, old, kingdom, middle, kingdom, and, new, kingdom, eras, by, the, greco, roman, period, there, were, more, than, 5, 000, scholars, have, long, debated, whether, hieroglyphs, were, original, developed, independently, of, any, other, script, or, derivative, original, scripts, are, very, rare, previously, scholars, like, geoffrey, sampson, argued, that, egyptian, hieroglyphs, came, into, existence, a, little, after, sumerian, script, and, probably, invented, under, the, influence, of, the, latter, and, that, it, is, probable, that, the, general, idea, of, expressing, words, of, a, language, in, writing, was, brought, to, egypt, from, sumerian, mesopotamia, further, egyptian, writing, appeared, suddenly, while, mesopotamia, had, a, long, evolutionary, history, of, the, usage, of, signs, for, agricultural, and, accounting, purposes, in, tokens, dating, as, early, back, to, c, 8000, bc, however, more, recent, scholars, have, held, that, the, evidence, for, such, direct, influence, remains, flimsy, and, that, a, very, credible, argument, can, also, be, made, for, the, independent, development, of, writing, in, egypt, while, there, are, many, instances, of, early, egypt, mesopotamia, relations, the, lack, of, direct, evidence, for, the, transfer, of, writing, means, that, no, definitive, determination, has, been, made, as, to, the, origin, of, hieroglyphics, in, ancient, egypt, since, the, 1990s, the, above, mentioned, discoveries, of, glyphs, at, abydos, dated, to, between, 3400, and, 3200, bce, have, shed, further, doubt, on, the, classical, notion, that, the, mesopotamian, symbol, system, predates, the, egyptian, one, a, date, of, c, 3400, bce, for, the, earliest, abydos, glyphs, challenges, the, hypothesis, of, diffusion, from, mesopotamia, to, egypt, pointing, to, an, independent, development, of, writing, in, egypt, rosalie, david, has, argued, that, the, debate, is, moot, since, if, egypt, did, adopt, the, idea, of, writing, from, elsewhere, it, was, presumably, only, the, concept, which, was, taken, over, since, the, forms, of, the, hieroglyphs, are, entirely, egyptian, in, origin, and, reflect, the, distinctive, flora, fauna, and, images, of, egypt, s, own, landscape, egyptian, scholar, gamal, mokhtar, argued, further, that, the, inventory, of, hieroglyphic, symbols, derived, from, fauna, and, flora, used, in, the, signs, are, essentially, african, and, in, regards, to, writing, we, have, seen, that, a, purely, nilotic, hence, african, origin, not, only, is, not, excluded, but, probably, reflects, the, reality, hieroglyphs, consist, of, three, kinds, of, glyphs, phonetic, glyphs, including, single, consonant, characters, that, function, like, an, alphabet, logographs, representing, morphemes, and, determinatives, which, narrow, down, the, meaning, of, logographic, or, phonetic, words, as, writing, developed, and, became, more, widespread, among, the, egyptian, people, simplified, glyph, forms, developed, resulting, in, the, hieratic, priestly, and, demotic, popular, scripts, these, variants, were, also, more, suited, than, hieroglyphs, for, use, on, papyrus, hieroglyphic, writing, was, not, however, eclipsed, but, existed, alongside, the, other, forms, especially, in, monumental, and, other, formal, writing, the, rosetta, stone, contains, three, parallel, scripts, hieroglyphic, demotic, and, greek, hieroglyphs, continued, to, be, used, under, persian, rule, intermittent, in, the, 6th, and, 5th, centuries, bce, and, after, alexander, the, great, s, conquest, of, egypt, during, the, ensuing, ptolemaic, and, roman, periods, it, appears, that, the, misleading, quality, of, comments, from, greek, and, roman, writers, about, hieroglyphs, came, about, at, least, in, part, as, a, response, to, the, changed, political, situation, some, believed, that, hieroglyphs, may, have, functioned, as, a, way, to, distinguish, true, egyptians, from, some, of, the, foreign, conquerors, another, reason, may, be, the, refusal, to, tackle, a, foreign, culture, on, its, own, terms, which, characterized, greco, roman, approaches, to, egyptian, culture, generally, having, learned, that, hieroglyphs, were, sacred, writing, greco, roman, authors, imagined, the, complex, but, rational, system, as, an, allegorical, even, magical, system, transmitting, secret, mystical, knowledge, by, the, 4th, century, ce, few, egyptians, were, capable, of, reading, hieroglyphs, and, the, myth, of, allegorical, hieroglyphs, was, ascendant, monumental, use, of, hieroglyphs, ceased, after, the, closing, of, all, non, christian, temples, in, 391, by, the, roman, emperor, theodosius, i, the, last, known, inscription, is, from, philae, known, as, the, graffito, of, esmet, akhom, from, 394, the, hieroglyphica, of, horapollo, c, 5th, century, appears, to, retain, some, genuine, knowledge, about, the, writing, system, it, offers, an, explanation, of, close, to, 200, signs, some, are, identified, correctly, such, as, the, goose, hieroglyph, z, representing, the, word, for, son, a, half, dozen, demotic, glyphs, are, still, in, use, added, to, the, greek, alphabet, when, writing, coptic, knowledge, of, the, hieroglyphs, had, been, lost, completely, in, the, medieval, period, early, attempts, at, decipherment, are, due, to, dhul, nun, al, misri, and, ibn, wahshiyya, 9th, and, 10th, century, respectively, all, medieval, and, early, modern, attempts, were, hampered, by, the, fundamental, assumption, that, hieroglyphs, recorded, ideas, and, not, the, sounds, of, the, language, as, no, bilingual, texts, were, available, any, such, symbolic, translation, could, be, proposed, without, the, possibility, of, verification, it, was, not, until, athanasius, kircher, in, the, mid, 17th, century, that, scholars, began, to, think, the, hieroglyphs, might, also, represent, sounds, kircher, was, familiar, with, coptic, and, thought, that, it, might, be, the, key, to, deciphering, the, hieroglyphs, but, was, held, back, by, a, belief, in, the, mystical, nature, of, the, symbols, the, breakthrough, in, decipherment, came, only, with, the, discovery, of, the, rosetta, stone, by, napoleon, s, troops, in, 1799, during, napoleon, s, egyptian, invasion, as, the, stone, presented, a, hieroglyphic, and, a, demotic, version, of, the, same, text, in, parallel, with, a, greek, translation, plenty, of, material, for, falsifiable, studies, in, translation, was, suddenly, available, in, the, early, 19th, century, scholars, such, as, silvestre, de, sacy, johan, david, kerblad, and, thomas, young, studied, the, inscriptions, on, the, stone, and, were, able, to, make, some, headway, finally, jean, fran, ois, champollion, made, the, complete, decipherment, by, the, 1820s, in, his, lettre, m, dacier, 1822, he, wrote, it, is, a, complex, system, writing, figurative, symbolic, and, phonetic, all, at, once, in, the, same, text, the, same, phrase, i, would, almost, say, in, the, same, word, visually, hieroglyphs, are, all, more, or, less, figurative, they, represent, real, or, abstract, elements, sometimes, stylized, and, simplified, but, all, generally, perfectly, recognizable, in, form, however, the, same, sign, can, according, to, context, be, interpreted, in, diverse, ways, as, a, phonogram, phonetic, reading, as, a, logogram, or, as, an, ideogram, semagram, determinative, semantic, reading, the, determinative, was, not, read, as, a, phonetic, constituent, but, facilitated, understanding, by, differentiating, the, word, from, its, homophones, most, non, determinative, hieroglyphic, signs, are, phonograms, whose, meaning, is, determined, by, pronunciation, independent, of, visual, characteristics, this, follows, the, rebus, principle, where, for, example, the, picture, of, an, eye, could, stand, not, only, for, the, english, word, eye, but, also, for, its, phonetic, equivalent, the, first, person, pronoun, i, phonograms, formed, with, one, consonant, are, called, uniliteral, signs, with, two, consonants, biliteral, signs, with, three, triliteral, signs, twenty, four, uniliteral, signs, make, up, the, so, called, hieroglyphic, alphabet, egyptian, hieroglyphic, writing, does, not, normally, indicate, vowels, unlike, cuneiform, and, for, that, reason, has, been, labelled, by, some, as, an, abjad, i, e, an, alphabet, without, vowels, thus, hieroglyphic, writing, representing, a, pintail, duck, is, read, in, egyptian, as, s, derived, from, the, main, consonants, of, the, egyptian, word, for, this, duck, s, and, t, note, that, or, two, half, rings, opening, to, the, left, sometimes, replaced, by, the, digit, 3, is, the, egyptian, alef, it, is, also, possible, to, use, the, hieroglyph, of, the, pintail, duck, without, a, link, to, its, meaning, in, order, to, represent, the, two, phonemes, s, and, independently, of, any, vowels, that, could, accompany, these, consonants, and, in, this, way, write, the, word, s, son, or, when, complemented, by, other, signs, detailed, below, s, keep, watch, and, s, w, hard, ground, for, example, the, characters, s, the, same, character, used, only, in, order, to, signify, according, to, the, context, pintail, duck, or, with, the, appropriate, determinative, son, two, words, having, the, same, or, similar, consonants, the, meaning, of, the, little, vertical, stroke, will, be, explained, further, on, under, logograms, the, character, s, as, used, in, the, word, s, w, keep, watch, as, in, the, arabic, script, not, all, vowels, were, written, in, egyptian, hieroglyphs, it, is, debatable, whether, vowels, were, written, at, all, possibly, as, with, arabic, the, semivowels, w, and, j, as, in, english, w, and, y, could, double, as, the, vowels, u, and, i, in, modern, transcriptions, an, e, is, added, between, consonants, to, aid, in, their, pronunciation, for, example, nfr, good, is, typically, written, nefer, this, does, not, reflect, egyptian, vowels, which, are, obscure, but, is, merely, a, modern, convention, likewise, the, and, are, commonly, transliterated, as, a, as, in, ra, r, hieroglyphs, are, inscribed, in, rows, of, pictures, arranged, in, horizontal, lines, or, vertical, columns, both, hieroglyph, lines, as, well, as, signs, contained, in, the, lines, are, read, with, upper, content, having, precedence, over, content, below, the, lines, or, columns, and, the, individual, inscriptions, within, them, read, from, left, to, right, in, rare, instances, only, and, for, particular, reasons, at, that, ordinarily, however, they, read, from, right, to, left, the, egyptians, preferred, direction, of, writing, although, for, convenience, modern, texts, are, often, normalized, into, left, to, right, order, the, direction, toward, which, asymmetrical, hieroglyphs, face, indicate, their, proper, reading, order, for, example, when, human, and, animal, hieroglyphs, face, or, look, toward, the, left, they, almost, always, must, be, read, from, left, to, right, and, vice, versa, as, in, many, ancient, writing, systems, words, are, not, separated, by, blanks, or, punctuation, marks, however, certain, hieroglyphs, appear, particularly, common, only, at, the, end, of, words, making, it, possible, to, readily, distinguish, words, the, egyptian, hieroglyphic, script, contained, 24, uniliterals, symbols, that, stood, for, single, consonants, much, like, letters, in, english, it, would, have, been, possible, to, write, all, egyptian, words, in, the, manner, of, these, signs, but, the, egyptians, never, did, so, and, never, simplified, their, complex, writing, into, a, true, alphabet, each, uniliteral, glyph, once, had, a, unique, reading, but, several, of, these, fell, together, as, old, egyptian, developed, into, middle, egyptian, for, example, the, folded, cloth, glyph, seems, to, have, been, originally, an, s, and, the, door, bolt, glyph, a, sound, but, these, both, came, to, be, pronounced, s, as, the, sound, was, lost, a, few, uniliterals, first, appear, in, middle, egyptian, texts, besides, the, uniliteral, glyphs, there, are, also, the, biliteral, and, triliteral, signs, to, represent, a, specific, sequence, of, two, or, three, consonants, consonants, and, vowels, and, a, few, as, vowel, combinations, only, in, the, language, egyptian, writing, is, often, redundant, in, fact, it, happens, very, frequently, that, a, word, is, followed, by, several, characters, writing, the, same, sounds, in, order, to, guide, the, reader, for, example, the, word, nfr, beautiful, good, perfect, was, written, with, a, unique, triliteral, that, was, read, as, nfr, however, it, is, considerably, more, common, to, add, to, that, triliteral, the, uniliterals, for, f, and, r, the, word, can, thus, be, written, as, nfr, f, r, but, one, still, reads, it, as, merely, nfr, the, two, alphabetic, characters, are, adding, clarity, to, the, spelling, of, the, preceding, triliteral, hieroglyph, redundant, characters, accompanying, biliteral, or, triliteral, signs, are, called, phonetic, complements, or, complementaries, they, can, be, placed, in, front, of, the, sign, rarely, after, the, sign, as, a, general, rule, or, even, framing, it, appearing, both, before, and, after, ancient, egyptian, scribes, consistently, avoided, leaving, large, areas, of, blank, space, in, their, writing, and, might, add, additional, phonetic, complements, or, sometimes, even, invert, the, order, of, signs, if, this, would, result, in, a, more, aesthetically, pleasing, appearance, good, scribes, attended, to, the, artistic, and, even, religious, aspects, of, the, hieroglyphs, and, would, not, simply, view, them, as, a, communication, tool, various, examples, of, the, use, of, phonetic, complements, can, be, seen, below, notably, phonetic, complements, were, also, used, to, allow, the, reader, to, differentiate, between, signs, that, are, homophones, or, which, do, not, always, have, a, unique, reading, for, example, the, symbol, of, the, seat, or, chair, finally, it, sometimes, happens, that, the, pronunciation, of, words, might, be, changed, because, of, their, connection, to, ancient, egyptian, in, this, case, it, is, not, rare, for, writing, to, adopt, a, compromise, in, notation, the, two, readings, being, indicated, jointly, for, example, the, adjective, bnj, sweet, became, bnr, in, middle, egyptian, one, can, write, which, is, fully, read, as, bnr, the, j, not, being, pronounced, but, retained, in, order, to, keep, a, written, connection, with, the, ancient, word, in, the, same, fashion, as, the, english, language, words, through, knife, or, victuals, which, are, no, longer, pronounced, the, way, they, are, written, besides, a, phonetic, interpretation, characters, can, also, be, read, for, their, meaning, in, this, instance, logograms, are, being, spoken, or, ideograms, and, semagrams, the, latter, are, also, called, determinatives, a, hieroglyph, used, as, a, logogram, defines, the, object, of, which, it, is, an, image, logograms, are, therefore, the, most, frequently, used, common, nouns, they, are, always, accompanied, by, a, mute, vertical, stroke, indicating, their, status, as, a, logogram, the, usage, of, a, vertical, stroke, is, further, explained, below, in, theory, all, hieroglyphs, would, have, the, ability, to, be, used, as, logograms, logograms, can, be, accompanied, by, phonetic, complements, here, are, some, examples, in, some, cases, the, semantic, connection, is, indirect, metonymic, or, metaphoric, determinatives, or, semagrams, semantic, symbols, specifying, meaning, are, placed, at, the, end, of, a, word, these, mute, characters, serve, to, clarify, what, the, word, is, about, as, homophonic, glyphs, are, common, if, a, similar, procedure, existed, in, english, words, with, the, same, spelling, would, be, followed, by, an, indicator, that, would, not, be, read, but, which, would, fine, tune, the, meaning, retort, and, retort, would, thus, be, distinguished, here, are, several, examples, of, the, use, of, determinatives, borrowed, from, the, book, je, lis, les, hi, roglyphes, i, am, reading, hieroglyphs, by, jean, capart, which, illustrate, their, importance, nfrw, w, and, the, three, strokes, are, the, marks, of, the, plural, the, beautiful, young, people, that, is, to, say, the, young, military, recruits, the, word, has, a, young, person, determinative, symbol, which, is, the, determinative, indicating, babies, and, children, nfr, t, t, is, here, the, suffix, that, forms, the, feminine, meaning, the, nubile, young, woman, with, as, the, determinative, indicating, a, woman, nfrw, the, tripling, of, the, character, serving, to, express, the, plural, flexional, ending, w, meaning, foundations, of, a, house, with, the, house, as, a, determinative, nfr, meaning, clothing, with, as, the, determinative, for, lengths, of, cloth, nfr, meaning, wine, or, beer, with, a, jug, as, the, determinative, all, these, words, have, a, meliorative, connotation, good, beautiful, perfect, the, concise, dictionary, of, middle, egyptian, by, raymond, a, faulkner, gives, some, twenty, words, that, are, read, nfr, or, which, are, formed, from, this, word, rarely, the, names, of, gods, are, placed, within, a, cartouche, the, two, last, names, of, the, sitting, king, are, always, placed, within, a, cartouche, jmn, r, amon, ra, qljw, pdr, t, cleopatra, a, filling, stroke, is, a, character, indicating, the, end, of, a, quadrat, that, would, otherwise, be, incomplete, some, signs, are, the, contraction, of, several, others, these, signs, have, however, a, function, and, existence, of, their, own, for, example, a, forearm, where, the, hand, holds, a, scepter, is, used, as, a, determinative, for, words, meaning, to, direct, to, drive, and, their, derivatives, the, doubling, of, a, sign, indicates, its, dual, the, tripling, of, a, sign, indicates, its, plural, standard, orthography, correct, spelling, in, egyptian, is, much, looser, than, in, modern, languages, in, fact, one, or, several, variants, exist, for, almost, every, word, one, finds, however, many, of, these, apparent, spelling, errors, constitute, an, issue, of, chronology, spelling, and, standards, varied, over, time, so, the, writing, of, a, word, during, the, old, kingdom, might, be, considerably, different, during, the, new, kingdom, furthermore, the, egyptians, were, perfectly, content, to, include, older, orthography, historical, spelling, alongside, newer, practices, as, though, it, were, acceptable, in, english, to, use, archaic, spellings, in, modern, texts, most, often, ancient, spelling, errors, are, simply, misinterpretations, of, context, today, hieroglyphicists, use, numerous, cataloguing, systems, notably, the, manuel, de, codage, and, gardiner, s, sign, list, to, clarify, the, presence, of, determinatives, ideograms, and, other, ambiguous, signs, in, transliteration, the, glyphs, in, this, cartouche, are, transliterated, as, ptolmys, though, ii, is, considered, a, single, letter, and, transliterated, y, another, way, in, which, hieroglyphs, work, is, illustrated, by, the, two, egyptian, words, pronounced, pr, usually, vocalised, as, per, one, word, is, house, and, its, hieroglyphic, representation, is, straightforward, here, the, house, hieroglyph, works, as, a, logogram, it, represents, the, word, with, a, single, sign, the, vertical, stroke, below, the, hieroglyph, is, a, common, way, of, indicating, that, a, glyph, is, working, as, a, logogram, another, word, pr, is, the, verb, to, go, out, leave, when, this, word, is, written, the, house, hieroglyph, is, used, as, a, phonetic, symbol, here, the, house, glyph, stands, for, the, consonants, pr, the, mouth, glyph, below, it, is, a, phonetic, complement, it, is, read, as, r, reinforcing, the, phonetic, reading, of, pr, the, third, hieroglyph, is, a, determinative, it, is, an, ideogram, for, verbs, of, motion, that, gives, the, reader, an, idea, of, the, meaning, of, the, word, egyptian, hieroglyphs, were, added, to, the, unicode, standard, in,
