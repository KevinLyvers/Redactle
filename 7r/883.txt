a, duel, is, an, arranged, engagement, in, combat, between, two, people, with, matched, weapons, during, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, and, earlier, duels, were, mostly, single, combats, fought, with, swords, the, rapier, and, later, the, small, sword, but, beginning, in, the, late, 18th, century, in, england, duels, were, more, commonly, fought, using, pistols, fencing, and, shooting, continued, to, coexist, throughout, the, 19th, century, the, duel, was, based, on, a, code, of, honor, duels, were, fought, not, to, kill, the, opponent, but, to, gain, satisfaction, that, is, to, restore, one, s, honor, by, demonstrating, a, willingness, to, risk, one, s, life, for, it, as, such, the, tradition, of, dueling, was, reserved, for, the, male, members, of, nobility, however, in, the, modern, era, it, extended, to, those, of, the, upper, classes, on, occasion, duels, with, swords, or, pistols, were, fought, between, women, legislation, against, dueling, dates, back, to, the, medieval, period, the, fourth, council, of, the, lateran, 1215, outlawed, duels, and, civil, legislation, in, the, holy, roman, empire, against, dueling, was, passed, in, the, wake, of, the, thirty, years, war, from, the, early, 17th, century, duels, became, illegal, in, the, countries, where, they, were, practiced, dueling, largely, fell, out, of, favour, in, england, by, the, mid, 19th, century, and, in, continental, europe, by, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, dueling, declined, in, the, eastern, united, states, in, the, 19th, century, and, by, the, time, of, the, american, civil, war, dueling, had, begun, to, wane, even, in, the, south, public, opinion, not, legislation, caused, the, change, research, has, linked, the, decline, of, dueling, to, increases, in, state, capacity, in, western, society, the, formal, concept, of, a, duel, developed, out, of, the, medieval, judicial, duel, and, older, pre, christian, practices, such, as, the, viking, age, holmgang, in, medieval, society, judicial, duels, were, fought, by, knights, and, squires, to, end, various, disputes, countries, such, as, france, germany, england, and, ireland, practiced, this, tradition, judicial, combat, took, two, forms, in, medieval, society, the, feat, of, arms, and, chivalric, combat, the, feat, of, arms, was, used, to, settle, hostilities, between, two, large, parties, and, supervised, by, a, judge, the, battle, was, fought, as, a, result, of, a, slight, or, challenge, to, one, party, s, honor, which, could, not, be, resolved, by, a, court, weapons, were, standardized, and, typical, of, a, knight, s, armoury, for, example, longswords, polearms, etc, however, weapon, quality, and, augmentations, were, at, the, discretion, of, the, knight, for, example, a, spiked, hand, guard, or, an, extra, grip, for, half, swording, the, parties, involved, would, wear, their, own, armour, for, example, one, knight, wearing, full, plate, might, face, another, wearing, chain, mail, the, duel, lasted, until, one, party, could, no, longer, fight, back, in, early, cases, the, defeated, party, was, then, executed, this, type, of, duel, soon, evolved, into, the, more, chivalric, pas, d, armes, or, passage, of, arms, a, chivalric, hastilude, that, evolved, in, the, late, 14th, century, and, remained, popular, through, the, 15th, century, a, knight, or, group, of, knights, tenans, or, holders, would, stake, out, a, travelled, spot, such, as, a, bridge, or, city, gate, and, let, it, be, known, that, any, other, knight, who, wished, to, pass, venans, or, comers, must, first, fight, or, be, disgraced, if, a, traveling, venans, did, not, have, weapons, or, horse, to, meet, the, challenge, one, might, be, provided, and, if, the, venans, chose, not, to, fight, he, would, leave, his, spurs, behind, as, a, sign, of, humiliation, if, a, lady, passed, unescorted, she, would, leave, behind, a, glove, or, scarf, to, be, rescued, and, returned, to, her, by, a, future, knight, who, passed, that, way, the, catholic, church, was, critical, of, dueling, throughout, medieval, history, frowning, both, on, the, traditions, of, judicial, combat, and, on, the, duel, on, points, of, honor, among, the, nobility, judicial, duels, were, deprecated, by, the, lateran, council, of, 1215, but, the, judicial, duel, persisted, in, the, holy, roman, empire, into, the, 15th, century, the, word, duel, comes, from, the, latin, duellum, cognate, with, bellum, meaning, war, during, the, early, renaissance, dueling, established, the, status, of, a, respectable, gentleman, and, was, an, accepted, manner, to, resolve, disputes, the, first, published, code, duello, or, code, of, dueling, appeared, in, renaissance, italy, the, first, formalized, national, code, was, that, of, france, during, the, renaissance, from, the, late, 1580s, to, the, 1620s, an, estimated, 10, 000, french, individuals, most, of, them, nobility, were, killed, in, duels, by, the, 17th, century, dueling, had, become, regarded, as, a, prerogative, of, the, aristocracy, throughout, europe, and, attempts, to, discourage, or, suppress, it, generally, failed, for, example, king, louis, xiii, of, france, outlawed, dueling, in, 1626, a, law, which, remained, in, force, afterwards, and, his, successor, louis, xiv, intensified, efforts, to, wipe, out, the, duel, despite, these, efforts, dueling, continued, unabated, and, it, is, estimated, that, between, 1685, and, 1716, french, officers, fought, 10, 000, duels, leading, to, over, 400, deaths, in, ireland, as, late, as, 1777, a, code, of, practice, was, drawn, up, for, the, regulation, of, duels, at, the, summer, assizes, in, the, town, of, clonmel, county, tipperary, a, copy, of, the, code, known, as, the, twenty, six, commandments, was, to, be, kept, in, a, gentleman, s, pistol, case, for, reference, should, a, dispute, arise, regarding, procedure, by, the, late, 18th, century, enlightenment, era, values, began, to, influence, society, with, new, self, conscious, ideas, about, politeness, civil, behavior, and, new, attitudes, toward, violence, the, cultivated, art, of, politeness, demanded, that, there, should, be, no, outward, displays, of, anger, or, violence, and, the, concept, of, honor, became, more, personalized, by, the, 1770s, the, practice, of, dueling, was, increasingly, coming, under, attack, from, many, sections, of, enlightened, society, as, a, violent, relic, of, europe, s, medieval, past, unsuited, for, modern, life, as, england, began, to, industrialize, and, benefit, from, urban, planning, and, more, effective, police, forces, the, culture, of, street, violence, in, general, began, to, slowly, wane, the, growing, middle, class, maintained, their, reputation, with, recourse, to, either, bringing, charges, of, libel, or, to, the, fast, growing, print, media, of, the, early, 19th, century, where, they, could, defend, their, honor, and, resolve, conflicts, through, correspondence, in, newspapers, influential, new, intellectual, trends, at, the, turn, of, the, 19th, century, bolstered, the, anti, dueling, campaign, the, utilitarian, philosophy, of, jeremy, bentham, stressed, that, praiseworthy, actions, were, exclusively, restricted, to, those, that, maximize, human, welfare, and, happiness, and, the, evangelical, notion, of, the, christian, conscience, began, to, actively, promote, social, activism, individuals, in, the, clapham, sect, and, similar, societies, who, had, successfully, campaigned, for, the, abolition, of, slavery, condemned, dueling, as, ungodly, violence, and, as, an, egocentric, culture, of, honor, the, former, united, states, secretary, of, the, treasury, alexander, hamilton, was, killed, in, a, duel, against, the, sitting, vice, president, aaron, burr, in, 1804, between, 1798, and, the, civil, war, the, u, s, navy, lost, two, thirds, as, many, officers, to, dueling, as, it, did, in, combat, at, sea, including, naval, hero, stephen, decatur, many, of, those, killed, or, wounded, were, midshipmen, or, junior, officers, despite, prominent, deaths, dueling, persisted, because, of, contemporary, ideals, of, chivalry, particularly, in, the, south, and, because, of, the, threat, of, ridicule, if, a, challenge, was, rejected, by, about, 1770, the, duel, underwent, a, number, of, important, changes, in, england, firstly, unlike, their, counterparts, in, many, continental, nations, english, duelists, enthusiastically, adopted, the, pistol, and, sword, duels, dwindled, special, sets, of, dueling, pistols, were, crafted, for, the, wealthiest, of, noblemen, for, this, purpose, also, the, office, of, second, developed, into, seconds, or, friends, being, chosen, by, the, aggrieved, parties, to, conduct, their, honor, dispute, these, friends, would, attempt, to, resolve, a, dispute, upon, terms, acceptable, to, both, parties, and, should, this, fail, they, would, arrange, and, oversee, the, mechanics, of, the, encounter, in, england, to, kill, in, the, course, of, a, duel, was, formally, judged, as, murder, but, generally, the, courts, were, very, lax, in, applying, the, law, as, they, were, sympathetic, to, the, culture, of, honor, despite, being, a, criminal, act, military, officers, in, many, countries, could, be, punished, if, they, failed, to, fight, a, duel, when, the, occasion, called, for, it, in, 1814, a, british, officer, was, court, martialed, cashiered, and, dismissed, from, the, army, for, failing, to, issue, a, challenge, after, he, was, publicly, insulted, this, attitude, lingered, on, queen, victoria, even, expressed, a, hope, that, lord, cardigan, prosecuted, for, wounding, another, in, a, duel, would, get, off, easily, the, anglican, church, was, generally, hostile, to, dueling, but, non, conformist, sects, in, particular, began, to, actively, campaign, against, it, by, 1840, dueling, had, declined, dramatically, when, the, 7th, earl, of, cardigan, was, acquitted, on, a, legal, technicality, for, homicide, in, connection, with, a, duel, with, one, of, his, former, officers, outrage, was, expressed, in, the, media, with, the, times, alleging, that, there, was, deliberate, high, level, complicity, to, leave, the, loophole, in, the, prosecution, and, reporting, the, view, that, in, england, there, is, one, law, for, the, rich, and, another, for, the, poor, and, the, examiner, describing, the, verdict, as, a, defeat, of, justice, the, last, known, fatal, duel, between, englishmen, in, england, occurred, in, 1845, when, james, alexander, seton, had, an, altercation, with, henry, hawkey, over, the, affections, of, his, wife, leading, to, a, duel, at, browndown, near, gosport, however, the, last, known, fatal, duel, to, occur, in, england, was, between, two, french, political, refugees, frederic, cournet, and, emmanuel, barth, lemy, near, englefield, green, in, 1852, the, former, was, killed, in, both, cases, the, winners, of, the, duels, hawkey, and, barth, lemy, were, tried, for, murder, but, hawkey, was, acquitted, and, barth, lemy, was, convicted, only, of, manslaughter, he, served, seven, months, in, prison, dueling, also, began, to, be, criticized, in, america, in, the, late, 18th, century, benjamin, franklin, denounced, the, practice, as, uselessly, violent, and, george, washington, encouraged, his, officers, to, refuse, challenges, during, the, american, revolutionary, war, because, he, believed, that, the, death, by, dueling, of, officers, would, have, threatened, the, success, of, the, war, effort, in, the, early, nineteenth, century, american, writer, and, activist, john, neal, took, up, dueling, as, his, earliest, reform, issue, attacking, the, institution, in, his, first, novel, keep, cool, 1817, and, referring, to, it, in, an, essay, that, same, year, as, the, unqualified, evidence, of, manhood, ironically, neal, was, challenged, to, a, duel, by, a, fellow, baltimore, lawyer, for, insults, published, in, his, 1823, novel, randolph, he, refused, and, mocked, the, challenge, in, his, next, novel, errata, published, the, same, year, reports, of, dueling, gained, in, popularity, in, the, first, half, of, the, 19th, century, especially, in, the, south, and, the, states, of, the, old, southwest, however, in, this, regional, context, the, term, dueling, had, severely, degenerated, from, its, original, 18th, century, definition, as, a, formal, social, custom, among, the, wealthy, classes, using, fixed, rules, of, conduct, instead, dueling, was, used, by, the, contemporary, press, of, the, day, to, refer, to, any, melee, knife, or, gun, fight, between, two, contestants, where, the, clear, object, was, simply, to, kill, one, s, opponent, dueling, began, an, irreversible, decline, in, the, aftermath, of, the, civil, war, even, in, the, south, public, opinion, increasingly, came, to, regard, the, practice, as, little, more, than, bloodshed, the, most, notorious, american, duel, is, the, burr, hamilton, duel, in, which, notable, federalist, and, former, secretary, of, the, treasury, alexander, hamilton, was, fatally, wounded, by, his, political, rival, the, sitting, vice, president, of, the, united, states, aaron, burr, another, american, politician, andrew, jackson, later, to, serve, as, a, general, officer, in, the, u, s, army, and, to, become, the, seventh, president, fought, two, duels, though, some, legends, claim, he, fought, many, more, on, may, 30, 1806, he, killed, prominent, duellist, charles, dickinson, suffering, himself, from, a, chest, wound, that, caused, him, a, lifetime, of, pain, jackson, also, reportedly, engaged, in, a, bloodless, duel, with, a, lawyer, and, in, 1803, came, very, near, dueling, with, john, sevier, jackson, also,

in, france, and, those, that, still, occurred, were, covered, in, the, press, as, eccentricities, duels, in, france, in, this, period, while, still, taken, seriously, as, a, matter, of, honor, were, not, fought, to, the, death, they, consisted, of, fencing, with, the, p, e, mostly, in, a, fixed, distance, with, the, aim, of, drawing, blood, from, the, opponent, s, arm, in, 1949, former, vichy,

been, wounded, twice, in, uruguay, a, pistol, duel, was, fought, in, 1971, between, danilo, sena, and, enrique, erro, in, which, neither, of, the, combatants, was, injured, various, modern, jurisdictions, still, retain, mutual, combat, laws, which, allow, disputes, to, be, settled, via, consensual, unarmed, combat, which, are, essentially, unarmed, duels, though, it, may, still, be, illegal, for, such, fights, to, result, in, grievous, bodily, harm, or, death, few, if, any, modern, jurisdictions, allow, armed, duels, the, traditional, situation, that, led, to, a, duel, often, happened, after, a, perceived, offense, whether, real, or, imagined, when, one, party, would, demand, satisfaction, from, the, offender, the, demand, was, commonly, symbolized, by, an, inescapably, insulting, gesture, such, as, throwing, a, glove, to, the, ground, before, the, offender, usually, challenges, were, delivered, in, writing, by, one, or, more, close, friends, who, acted, as, seconds, the, challenge, written, in, formal, language, laid, out, the, real, or, imagined, grievances, and, a, demand, for, satisfaction, the, challenged, party, then, had, the, choice, of, accepting, or, refusing, the, challenge, grounds, for, refusing, the, challenge, could, include, that, it, was, frivolous, or, that, the, challenger, was, not, generally, recognized, as, a, gentleman, since, dueling, was, limited, to, persons, of, equal, social, status, however, care, had, to, be, taken, before, declining, a, challenge, as, it, could, result, in, accusations, of, cowardice, or, be, perceived, as, an, insult, to, the, challenger, s, seconds, if, it, was, implied, that, they, were, acting, on, behalf, of, someone, of, low, social, standing, participation, in, a, duel, could, be, honorably, refused, on, account, of, a, major, difference, in, age, between, the, parties, and, to, a, lesser, extent, in, cases, of, social, inferiority, on, the, part, of, the, challenger, such, inferiority, had, to, be, immediately, obvious, however, as, author, bertram, wyatt, brown, states, with, social, distinctions, often, difficult, to, measure, most, men, could, not, escape, on, such, grounds, without, the, appearance, of, cowardice, once, a, challenge, was, accepted, if, not, done, already, both, parties, known, as, principals, would, appoint, trusted, representatives, to, act, as, their, seconds, with, no, further, direct, communication, between, the, principals, being, allowed, until, the, dispute, was, settled, the, seconds, had, a, number, of, responsibilities, of, which, the, first, was, to, do, all, in, their, power, to, avert, bloodshed, provided, their, principal, s, honor, was, not, compromised, this, could, involve, back, and, forth, correspondence, about, a, mutually, agreeable, lesser, course, of, action, such, as, a, formal, apology, for, the, alleged, offense, in, the, event, that, the, seconds, failed, to, persuade, their, principals, to, avoid, a, fight, they, then, attempted, to, agree, on, terms, for, the, duel, that, would, limit, the, chance, of, a, fatal, outcome, consistent, with, the, generally, accepted, guidelines, for, affairs, of, honor, the, exact, rules, or, etiquette, for, dueling, varied, by, time, and, locale, but, were, usually, referred, to, as, the, code, duello, in, most, cases, the, challenged, party, had, the, choice, of, weapons, with, swords, being, favored, in, many, parts, of, continental, europe, and, pistols, in, the, united, states, and, great, britain, it, was, the, job, of, the, seconds, to, make, all, of, the, arrangements, in, advance, including, how, long, the, duel, would, last, and, what, conditions, would, end, the, duel, often, sword, duels, were, only, fought, until, blood, was, drawn, thus, severely, limiting, the, likelihood, of, death, or, grave, injury, since, a, scratch, could, be, considered, as, satisfying, honor, in, pistol, duels, the, number, of, shots, to, be, permitted, and, the, range, were, set, out, care, was, taken, by, the, seconds, to, ensure, the, ground, chosen, gave, no, unfair, advantage, to, either, party, a, doctor, or, surgeon, was, usually, arranged, to, be, on, hand, other, things, often, arranged, by, the, seconds, could, go, into, minute, details, that, might, seem, odd, in, the, modern, world, such, as, the, dress, code, duels, were, often, formal, affairs, the, number, and, names, of, any, other, witnesses, to, be, present, and, whether, or, not, refreshments, would, be, served, the, chief, criteria, for, choosing, the, field, of, honor, were, isolation, to, avoid, discovery, and, interruption, by, the, authorities, and, jurisdictional, ambiguity, to, avoid, legal, consequences, islands, in, rivers, dividing, two, jurisdictions, were, popular, dueling, sites, the, cliffs, below, weehawken, on, the, hudson, river, where, the, hamilton, burr, duel, occurred, were, a, popular, field, of, honor, for, new, york, duelists, because, of, the, uncertainty, of, whether, new, york, or, new, jersey, had, jurisdiction, duels, traditionally, took, place, at, dawn, when, the, poor, light, would, make, the, participants, less, likely, to, be, seen, and, to, force, an, interval, for, reconsideration, or, sobering, up, for, some, time, before, the, mid, 18th, century, swordsmen, dueling, at, dawn, often, carried, lanterns, to, see, each, other, this, happened, so, regularly, that, fencing, manuals, integrated, lanterns, into, their, lessons, an, example, of, this, is, using, the, lantern, to, parry, blows, and, blind, the, opponent, the, manuals, sometimes, show, the, combatants, carrying, the, lantern, in, the, left, hand, wrapped, behind, the, back, which, is, still, one, of, the, traditional, positions, for, the, off, hand, in, modern, fencing, at, the, choice, of, the, offended, party, the, duel, could, be, fought, to, a, number, of, conclusions, under, the, latter, conditions, one, or, both, parties, could, intentionally, miss, in, order, to, fulfill, the, conditions, of, the, duel, without, loss, of, either, life, or, honor, however, doing, so, known, as, deloping, could, imply, that, one, s, opponent, was, not, worth, shooting, this, practice, occurred, despite, being, expressly, banned, by, the, irish, code, duello, of, 1777, rule, xii, stated, no, dumb, shooting, or, firing, in, the, air, is, admissible, in, any, case, children, s, play, must, be, dishonourable, on, one, side, or, the, other, and, is, accordingly, prohibited, practices, varied, however, but, unless, the, challenger, was, of, a, higher, social, standing, such, as, a, baron, or, prince, challenging, a, knight, the, person, being, challenged, was, allowed, to, decide, the, time, and, weapons, used, in, the, duel, the, offended, party, could, stop, the, duel, at, any, time, if, he, deemed, his, honor, satisfied, in, some, duels, the, seconds, would, take, the, place, of, the, primary, duelist, if, the, primary, was, not, able, to, finish, the, duel, this, was, usually, done, in, duels, with, swords, where, one, s, expertise, was, sometimes, limited, the, second, would, also, act, as, a, witness, there, were, various, methods, of, pistol, dueling, the, mode, where, the, two, duelists, stood, back, to, back, walked, away, from, each, other, for, a, set, number, of, paces, before, turning, and, firing, was, known, as, the, french, method, another, method, required, the, duelists, to, stand, still, at, an, agreed, distance, and, fire, simultaneously, on, a, signal, this, was, the, type, of, duel, favored, in, britain, a, variant, of, this, required, the, duelists, to, take, turns, to, shoot, with, the, challenger, shooting, first, or, the, right, of, first, shot, being, decided, by, a, coin, toss, the, distance, at, which, the, pistols, were, fired, might, depend, on, local, custom, the, wishes, of, the, duelists, or, sometimes, the, severity, of, the, insult, the, american, dueling, code, of, 1838, suggested, a, distance, between, 10, and, 20, paces, there, were, incidences, of, pistol, duels, taking, place, at, just, two, or, three, paces, with, a, virtual, certainty, of, one, or, both, duelists, being, injured, or, killed, a, method, popular, in, continental, europe, was, known, as, a, barrier, duel, or, a, duel, volont, at, pleasure, it, did, not, have, a, set, shooting, distance, the, two, duelists, began, some, distance, apart, between, them, there, were, two, lines, on, the, ground, separated, by, an, agreed, distance, this, constituted, the, barrier, and, they, were, forbidden, to, cross, it, after, the, signal, to, begin, they, could, advance, towards, the, barrier, to, close, the, distance, and, were, permitted, to, fire, at, any, time, however, the, one, that, shot, first, was, required, to, stand, still, and, allow, his, opponent, to, walk, right, up, to, his, barrier, line, and, fire, back, at, leisure, many, historical, duels, were, prevented, by, the, difficulty, of, arranging, the, methodus, pugnandi, in, the, instance, of, richard, brocklesby, the, number, of, paces, could, not, be, agreed, upon, and, in, the, affair, between, mark, akenside, and, ballow, one, had, determined, never, to, fight, in, the, morning, and, the, other, that, he, would, never, fight, in, the, afternoon, john, wilkes, who, did, not, stand, upon, ceremony, in, these, little, affairs, when, asked, by, lord, talbot, how, many, times, they, were, to, fire, replied, just, as, often, as, your, lordship, pleases, i, have, brought, a, bag, of, bullets, and, a, flask, of, gunpowder, the, duel, arrived, at, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, with, the, influx, of, italian, honor, and, courtesy, literature, most, notably, baldassare, castiglione, s, libro, del, cortegiano, book, of, the, courtier, published, in, 1528, and, girolamo, muzio, s, il, duello, published, in, 1550, these, stressed, the, need, to, protect, one, s, reputation, and, social, mask, and, prescribed, the, circumstances, under, which, an, insulted, party, should, issue, a, challenge, the, word, duel, was, introduced, in, the, 1590s, modeled, after, medieval, latin, duellum, an, archaic, latin, form, of, bellum, war, but, associated, by, popular, etymology, with, duo, two, hence, one, on, one, combat, soon, domestic, literature, was, being, produced, such, as, simon, robson, s, the, courte, of, ciuill, courtesie, published, in, 1577, dueling, was, further, propagated, by, the, arrival, of, italian, fencing, masters, such, as, rocco, bonetti, and, vincento, saviolo, by, the, reign, of, james, i, dueling, was, well, entrenched, within, a, militarized, peerage, one, of, the, most, important, duels, being, that, between, edward, bruce, 2nd, lord, kinloss, and, edward, sackville, later, the, 4th, earl, of, dorset, in, 1613, during, which, bruce, was, killed, james, i, encouraged, francis, bacon, as, solicitor, general, to, prosecute, would, be, duelists, in, the, court, of, star, chamber, leading, to, about, two, hundred, prosecutions, between, 1603, and, 1625, he, also, issued, an, edict, against, dueling, in, 1614, and, is, believed, to, have, supported, production, of, an, anti, dueling, tract, by, the, earl, of, northampton, dueling, however, continued, to, spread, out, from, the, court, notably, into, the, army, in, the, mid, 17th, century, it, was, for, a, time, checked, by, the, activities, of, the, parliamentarians, whose, articles, of, war, specified, the, death, penalty, for, would, be, duelists, nevertheless, dueling, survived, and, increased, markedly, with, the, restoration, among, the, difficulties, of, anti, dueling, campaigners, was, that, although, monarchs, uniformly, proclaimed, their, general, hostility, to, dueling, they, were, nevertheless, very, reluctant, to, see, their, own, favorites, punished, in, 1712, both, the, duke, of, hamilton, and, charles, 4th, baron, mohun, were, killed, in, a, celebrated, duel, induced, by, political, rivalry, and, squabbles, over, an, inheritance, by, the, 1780s, the, values, of, the, duel, had, spread, into, the, broader, and, emerging, society, of, gentlemen, research, shows, that, much, the, largest, group, of, later, duelists, were, military, officers, followed, by, the, young, sons, of, the, metropolitan, elite, see, banks, a, polite, exchange, of, bullets, dueling, was, also, popular, for, a, time, among, doctors, and, in, particular, in, the, legal, professions, quantifying, the, number, of, duels, in, britain, is, difficult, but, there, are, about, 1, 000, attested, between, 1785, and, 1845, with, fatality, rates, at, least, 15, and, probably, somewhat, higher, in, 1777, at, the, summer, assizes, in, the, town, of, clonmel, county, tipperary, a, code, of, practice, was, drawn, up, for, the, regulation, of, duels, it, was, agreed, by, delegates, from, counties, tipperary, galway, mayo, sligo, and, roscommon, and, intended, for, general, adoption, throughout, ireland, an, amended, version, known, as, the, irish, code, of, honor, and, consisting, of, 25, rules, was, adopted, in, some, parts, of, the, united, states, the, first, article, of, the, code, stated, rule, 1, the, first, offence, requires, the, apology, although, the, retort, may, have, been, more, offensive, than, the, insult, example, a, tells, b, he, is, impertinent, c, b, retorts, that, he, lies, yet, a, must, make, the, first, apology, because, he, gave, the, first, offence, and, then, after, one, fire, b, may, explain, away, the, retort, by, subsequent, apology, the, 19th, century, irish, statesman, daniel, o, connell, took, part, in, a, duel, in, 1815, following, the, death, of, his, opponent, john, d, esterre, o, connell, repented, and, from, that, time, wore, a, white, glove, on, his, right, hand, when, attending, mass, as, a, public, symbol, of, his, regret, despite, numerous, challenges, he, refused, ever, to, fight, another, duel, the, last, duel, in, england, was, fought, in, 1852, between, two, french, political, exiles, in, 1862, in, an, article, entitled, dead, and, gone, shots, charles, dickens, recalled, the, rules, and, myths, of, irish, dueling, in, his, periodical, all, the, year, round, four, prime, ministers, of, the, united, kingdom, engaged, in, duels, although, only, two, of, them, pitt, and, wellington, held, the, office, at, the, time, of, their, duels, in, early, new, high, german, the, duel, was, known, as, kampf, or, kampffechten, the, german, dueling, tradition, originates, in, the, late, middle, ages, within, the, german, school, of, fencing, in, the, 15th, century, duels, were, fought, between, members, of, the, nobility, wearing, full, plate, armor, during, the, late, 16th, and, the, 17th, century, this, tradition, was, gradually, replaced, with, the, modern, fencing, with, the, rapier, following, the, dardi, school, while, at, the, same, time, the, practice, of, dueling, spread, to, the, bourgeois, classes, especially, among, students, the, term, kampf, is, replaced, by, the, modern, german, duell, during, the, same, period, attested, in, the, latin, form, duellum, from, c, 1600, and, as, duell, from, the, 1640s, a, modern, remnant, of, german, dueling, culture, is, found, in, the, non, lethal, mensur, tradition, in, academic, fencing, in, the, ionian, islands, in, the, 19th, century, there, was, a, practice, of, formalized, fighting, between, men, over, points, of, honor, knives, were, the, weapons, used, in, such, fights, they, would, begin, with, an, exchange, of, sexually, related, insults, in, a, public, place, such, as, a, tavern, and, the, men, would, fight, with, the, intention, of, slashing, the, other, s, face, rather, than, killing, as, soon, as, blood, was, drawn, onlookers, would, intervene, to, separate, the, men, the, winner, would, often, spit, on, his, opponent, and, dip, his, neckerchief, in, the, blood, of, the, loser, or, wipe, the, blood, off, his, knife, with, it, the, winner, would, generally, make, no, attempt, to, avoid, arrest, and, would, receive, a, light, penalty, such, as, a, short, jail, sentence, and, or, a, small, fine, in, poland, duels, have, been, known, since, the, middle, ages, the, best, known, polish, code, was, written, as, late, as, 1919, by, w, adys, aw, boziewicz, at, this, time, duels, were, already, forbidden, in, poland, but, the, polish, honorary, code, was, quite, widely, in, use, punishments, for, participation, in, duels, were, rather, mild, up, to, a, year, s, imprisonment, if, the, outcome, of, the, duel, was, death, or, grievous, bodily, harm, the, tradition, of, dueling, and, the, word, duel, itself, were, brought, to, russia, in, the, 17th, century, by, adventurers, in, russian, service, dueling, quickly, became, so, popular, and, the, number, of, casualties, among, the, commanding, ranks, so, high, that, in, 1715, emperor, peter, i, was, forced, to, forbid, the, practice, on, pain, of, having, both, duelists, hanged, despite, this, official, ban, dueling, became, a, significant, military, tradition, in, the, russian, empire, with, a, detailed, unwritten, dueling, code, which, was, eventually, written, down, by, v, durasov, and, released, in, print, in, 1908, this, code, forbade, duels, between, people, of, different, ranks, for, instance, an, infantry, captain, could, not, challenge, a, major, but, could, easily, pick, on, a, titular, counsellor, on, the, other, hand, a, higher, ranked, person, could, not, stoop, to, challenge, lower, ranks, so, it, was, up, to, his, subordinates, or, servants, to, take, revenge, on, their, master, s, behalf, dueling, was, also, common, among, prominent, russian, writers, poets, and, politicians, the, russian, poet, alexander, pushkin, fought, 29, duels, challenging, many, prominent, figures, before, being, killed, in, a, duel, with, georges, d, anth, s, in, 1837, his, successor, mikhail, lermontov, was, killed, four, years, later, by, fellow, army, officer, nikolai, martynov, the, dueling, tradition, died, out, in, the, russian, empire, slowly, from, the, mid, 19th, century, duels, were, common, in, much, of, south, america, during, the, 20th, century, although, generally, illegal, in, argentina, during, the, 18th, and, 19th, century, it, was, common, for, gauchos, cowboys, to, resolve, their, disputes, in, a, fight, using, working, knives, called, facones, after, the, turn, of, the, 19th, century, when, repeating, handguns, became, more, widely, available, use, of, the, fac, n, as, a, close, combat, weapon, declined, among, the, gauchos, many, continued, to, wear, the, knife, though, mostly, as, a, tool, however, it, was, occasionally, still, used, to, settle, arguments, of, honor, in, these, situations, two, adversaries, would, attack, with, slashing, attacks, to, the, face, stopping, when, one, could, no, longer, see, clearly, through, the, blood, in, peru, there, were, several, high, profile, duels, by, politicians, in, the, early, part, of, the, 20th, century, including, one, in, 1957, involving, fernando, bela, nde, terry, who, went, on, to, become, president, in, 2002, peruvian, independent, congressman, eittel, ramos, challenged, vice, president, david, waisman, to, a, duel, with, pistols, saying, the, vice, president, had, insulted, him, waisman, declined, uruguay, decriminalized, dueling, in, 1920, and, in, that, year, jos, batlle, y, ord, ez, a, former, president, of, uruguay, killed, washington, beltran, editor, of, the, newspaper, el, pa, s, in, a, formal, duel, fought, with, pistols, in, 1990, another, editor, was, challenged, to, a, duel, by, an, assistant, police, chief, although, not, forbidden, by, the, government, the, duel, did, not, take, place, dueling, was, once, again, prohibited, in, 1992, a, senator, and, future, president, of, chile, salvador, allende, was, challenged, to, a, duel, by, his, colleague, ra, l, rettig, who, would, later, be, his, ambassador, to, brazil, in, 1952, both, men, agreed, to, fire, one, shot, at, each, other, and, both, fired, into, the, air, at, that, time, dueling, was, already, illegal, in, chile, there, is, a, frequently, quoted, claim, that, dueling, is, legal, in, paraguay, if, both, parties, are, blood, donors, no, evidence, exists, that, this, is, indeed, true, and, the, notion, has, been, outright, denied, by, members, of, paraguayan, government, european, styles, of, dueling, established, themselves, in, the, colonies, of, european, states, in, north, america, duels, were, to, challenge, someone, over, a, woman, or, to, defend, one, s, honor, in, the, us, dueling, tended, to, arise, over, political, differences, as, early, as, 1728, some, us, states, began, to, restrict, or, prohibit, the, practice, the, penalty, established, upon, conviction, of, killing, another, person, in, a, duel, in, the, massachusetts, bay, colony, in, its, 1728, law, to, punish, and, prevent, dueling, stated, in, case, any, person, shall, slay, or, kill, any, other, in, duel, or, fight, as, aforesaid, and, upon, conviction, thereof, suffer, the, pains, of, death, as, is, by, law, provided, for, wilful, murder, the, body, of, such, person, shall, not, be, allowed, christian, burial, but, be, buried, without, a, coffin, with, a, stake, driven, through, the, body, at, or, near, the, place, of, execution, as, aforesaid, dueling, was, the, subject, of, an, unsuccessful, federal, amendment, to, the, united, states, constitution, in, 1838, it, was, fairly, common, for, politicians, at, that, time, in, the, united, states, to, end, disputes, through, duels, such, as, the, burr, hamilton, duel, and, the, jackson, dickinson, duel, while, dueling, had, become, outdated, in, the, north, since, the, early, 19th, century, this, was, not, true, of, other, regions, of, the, nation, physician, j, marion, sims, described, the, dueling, culture, in, 1830s, south, carolina, in, the, south, teenage, duels, were, not, uncommon, particularly, in, south, carolina, and, new, orleans, three, ironies, emerged, from, the, dueling, custom, first, though, confined, to, a, segment, of, the, upper, classes, dueling, served, essentially, the, same, purpose, as, the, lowest, eye, gouging, battle, among, tennessee, hog, drivers, second, because, of, this, congruence, between, upper, and, lower, concepts, of, honor, dueling, was, not, at, all, undemocratic, it, enabled, lesser, men, to, enter, however, imperfectly, the, ranks, of, leaders, and, allowed, followers, to, manipulate, leaders, to, their, taste, third, the, promise, of, esteem, and, status, that, beckoned, men, to, the, field, of, honor, did, not, always, match, the, expectation, but, often, enough, dueling, served, as, a, form, of, scapegoating, for, unresolved, personal, problems, however, as, the, 19th, century, progressed, the, american, definition, of, dueling, had, clearly, degenerated, from, an, inherited, european, social, custom, using, seconds, and, set, rules, of, conduct, instead, the, term, was, increasingly, used, to, describe, any, violent, fight, or, melee, between, two, or, more, contestants, using, mixed, weapons, clubs, bottles, bowie, knives, or, firearms, of, any, type, or, description, newspapers, of, the, day, freely, used, the, term, duel, to, include, fights, between, combatants, of, any, class, or, social, order, by, 1859, 18, states, had, outlawed, dueling, outright, and, with, few, exceptions, traditional, dueling, using, seconds, and, formal, rules, of, conduct, had, largely, died, out, in, the, us, by, the, 1870s, in, 1891, kentucky, passed, a, law, that, anyone, sworn, into, any, statewide, or, county, office, or, judgeship, in, kentucky, must, declare, under, oath, that, he, or, she, has, not, participated, in, acted, as, a, second, or, otherwise, assisted, in, a, duel, a, law, which, is, still, in, effect, crude, so, called, quick, draw, duels, though, in, reality, very, rare, were, also, fought, to, uphold, personal, honor, in, the, western, american, frontier, partly, influenced, by, the, code, duello, brought, by, southern, emigrants, the, quick, draw, duel, is, a, common, trope, in, a, gunfighter, story, in, most, western, stories, although, some, of, the, few, real, life, wild, west, duels, that, did, occur, included, the, wild, bill, hickok, davis, tutt, shootout, and, luke, short, jim, courtright, duel, gunfighters, jim, levy, and, tom, carberry, became, infamous, for, participating, in, at, least, two, quick, draw, duels, in, their, lifetimes, besides, quick, draw, duels, more, formal, european, duels, were, also, fought, in, the, old, west, such, as, those, participated, by, former, cowboys, hugh, anderson, and, burton, c, mossman, settlements, such, as, tombstone, and, dodge, city, attempted, to, prevent, these, so, called, duels, by, prohibiting, civilians, from, carrying, firearms, by, local, ordinance, with, little, success, instead, conflicts, were, increasingly, resolved, by, the, formation, of, organized, law, enforcement, and, the, institution, of, judicial, process, in, upper, canada, then, a, british, colony, john, wilson, killed, robert, lyon, on, june, 13, 1833, in, perth, that, incident, is, believed, by, some, to, have, been, the, last, fatal, duel, fought, in, canada, it, was, certainly, the, last, in, what, is, now, ontario, however, several, reliable, sources, state, that, the, last, fatal, duel, in, what, is, now, canada, occurred, in, lower, canada, now, quebec, on, may, 22, 1838, the, duelists, were, british, officer, major, henry, warde, and, lawyer, robert, sweeney, warde, was, wounded, in, that, incident, and, subsequently, died, australia, had, a, history, of, dueling, with, the, last, recorded, one, being, in, sydney, between, thomas, mitchell, and, stuart, donaldson, later, premier, of, new, south, wales, in, 1851, only, donaldson, s, hat, was, damaged, duels, or, niyuddha, were, held, in, ancient, india, including, modern, day, pakistan, and, bangladesh, for, various, reasons, many, kshatriya, considered, it, shameful, to, die, in, bed, and, in, their, old, age, often, arranged, for, a, yuddha, dhan, literally, meaning, combat, charity, according, to, this, practice, when, a, warrior, felt, he, did, not, have, much, time, to, live, he, would, go, along, with, a, few, attendants, and, ask, another, king, for, a, duel, or, a, small, scale, battle, in, this, way, he, chooses, his, own, time, and, manner, of, death, and, is, assured, that, he, will, die, fighting, duels, to, the, death, were, legal, in, some, periods, and, punishable, by, execution, in, others, ancient, epics, and, texts, like, the, dharmashastra, tell, that, duels, took, place, under, strict, rules, of, conduct, and, to, violate, them, was, both, shameful, and, sinful, according, to, these, rules,
