statutory, interpretation, is, the, process, by, which, courts, interpret, and, apply, legislation, some, amount, of, interpretation, is, often, necessary, when, a, case, involves, a, statute, sometimes, the, words, of, a, statute, have, a, plain, and, a, straightforward, meaning, but, in, many, cases, there, is, some, ambiguity, in, the, words, of, the, statute, that, must, be, resolved, by, the, judge, to, find, the, meanings, of, statutes, judges, use, various, tools, and, methods, of, statutory, interpretation, including, traditional, canons, of, statutory, interpretation, legislative, history, and, purpose, in, common, law, jurisdictions, the, judiciary, may, apply, rules, of, statutory, interpretation, both, to, legislation, enacted, by, the, legislature, and, to, delegated, legislation, such, as, administrative, agency, regulations, statutory, interpretation, first, became, significant, in, common, law, systems, of, which, historically, england, is, the, exemplar, in, roman, and, civil, law, a, statute, or, code, guides, the, magistrate, but, there, is, no, judicial, precedent, in, england, parliament, historically, failed, to, enact, a, comprehensive, code, of, legislation, which, is, why, it, was, left, to, the, courts, to, develop, the, common, law, and, having, decided, a, case, and, given, reasons, for, the, decision, the, decision, would, become, binding, on, later, courts, accordingly, a, particular, interpretation, of, a, statute, would, also, become, binding, and, it, became, necessary, to, introduce, a, consistent, framework, for, statutory, interpretation, in, the, construction, interpretation, of, statutes, the, principal, aim, of, the, court, must, be, to, carry, out, the, intention, of, parliament, and, the, english, courts, developed, three, main, rules, plus, some, minor, ones, to, assist, them, in, the, task, these, were, the, mischief, rule, the, literal, rule, and, the, golden, rule, statutes, may, be, presumed, to, incorporate, certain, components, as, parliament, is, presumed, to, have, intended, their, inclusion, for, example, where, legislation, and, case, law, are, in, conflict, there, is, a, presumption, that, legislation, takes, precedence, insofar, as, there, is, any, inconsistency, in, the, united, kingdom, this, principle, is, known, as, parliamentary, sovereignty, but, while, parliament, has, exclusive, competence, to, legislate, the, courts, mindful, of, their, historic, role, of, having, developed, the, entire, system, of, common, law, retain, sole, competence, to, interpret, statutes, the, age, old, process, of, application, of, the, enacted, law, has, led, to, the, formulation, of, certain, rules, of, interpretation, according, to, cross, interpretation, is, the, process, by, which, the, courts, determine, the, meaning, of, a, statutory, provision, for, the, purpose, of, applying, it, to, the, situation, before, them, while, salmond, calls, it, the, process, by, which, the, courts, seek, to, ascertain, the, meaning, of, the, legislature, through, the, medium, of, authoritative, forms, in, which, it, is, expressed, interpretation, of, a, particular, statute, depends, upon, the, degree, of, creativity, applied, by, the, judges, or, the, court, in, the, reading, of, it, employed, to, achieve, some, stated, end, it, is, often, mentioned, that, common, law, statutes, can, be, interpreted, by, using, the, golden, rule, the, mischief, rule, or, the, literal, rule, however, according, to, francis, bennion, author, of, texts, on, statutory, interpretation, there, are, no, such, simple, devices, to, elucidate, complex, statutes, nstead, there, are, a, thousand, and, one, interpretative, criteria, a, statute, is, an, edict, of, a, legislature, and, the, conventional, way, of, interpreting, a, statute, is, to, seek, the, intention, of, its, maker, it, is, the, judicature, s, duty, to, act, upon, the, true, intention, of, the, legislature, or, the, mens, or, sentential, legis, the, courts, have, to, objectively, determine, the, interpretation, with, guidance, furnished, by, the, accepted, principles, if, a, statutory, provision, is, open, to, more, than, one, interpretation, the, court, has, to, choose, that, interpretation, which, represents, the, true, intention, of, the, legislature, the, function, of, the, courts, is, only, to, expound, and, not, to, legislate, federal, jurisdictions, may, presume, that, either, federal, or, local, government, authority, prevails, in, the, absence, of, a, defined, rule, in, canada, there, are, areas, of, law, where, provincial, governments, and, the, federal, government, have, concurrent, jurisdiction, in, these, cases, the, federal, law, is, held, to, be, paramount, however, in, areas, where, the, canadian, constitution, is, silent, the, federal, government, does, not, necessarily, have, superior, jurisdiction, rather, an, area, of, law, that, is, not, expressly, mentioned, in, canada, s, constitution, will, have, to, be, interpreted, to, fall, under, either, the, federal, residual, jurisdiction, found, in, the, preamble, of, s, 91, known, as, the, peace, order, and, good, government, clause, or, the, provinces, residual, jurisdiction, of, property, and, civil, rights, under, s, 92, 13a, of, the, 1867, constitution, act, this, contrasts, with, other, federal, jurisdictions, notably, the, united, states, and, australia, where, it, is, presumed, that, if, legislation, is, not, enacted, pursuant, to, a, specific, provision, of, the, federal, constitution, the, states, will, have, authority, over, the, relevant, matter, in, their, respective, jurisdictions, unless, the, state, s, definitions, of, their, statutes, conflicts, with, federally, established, or, recognized, rights, the, judiciary, interprets, how, legislation, should, apply, in, a, particular, case, as, no, legislation, unambiguously, and, specifically, addresses, all, matters, legislation, may, contain, uncertainties, for, a, variety, of, reasons, therefore, the, court, must, try, to, determine, how, a, statute, should, be, enforced, this, requires, statutory, construction, it, is, a, tenet, of, statutory, construction, that, the, legislature, is, supreme, assuming, constitutionality, when, creating, law, and, that, the, court, is, merely, an, interpreter, of, the, law, nevertheless, in, practice, by, performing, the, construction, the, court, can, make, sweeping, changes, in, the, operation, of, the, law, moreover, courts, must, also, often, view, a, case, s, statutory, context, while, cases, occasionally, focus, on, a, few, key, words, or, phrases, judges, may, occasionally, turn, to, viewing, a, case, in, its, whole, in, order, to, gain, deeper, understanding, the, totality, of, the, language, of, a, particular, case, allows, the, justices, presiding, to, better, consider, their, rulings, when, it, comes, to, these, key, words, and, phrases, statutory, interpretation, is, the, process, by, which, a, court, looks, at, a, statute, and, determines, what, it, means, a, statute, which, is, a, bill, or, law, passed, by, the, legislature, imposes, obligations, and, rules, on, the, people, although, legislature, makes, the, statute, it, may, be, open, to, interpretation, and, have, ambiguities, statutory, interpretation, is, the, process, of, resolving, those, ambiguities, and, deciding, how, a, particular, bill, or, law, will, apply, in, a, particular, case, assume, for, example, that, a, statute, mandates, that, all, motor, vehicles, travelling, on, a, public, roadway, must, be, registered, with, the, department, of, motor, vehicles, dmv, if, the, statute, does, not, define, the, term, motor, vehicles, then, that, term, will, have, to, be, interpreted, if, questions, arise, in, a, court, of, law, a, person, driving, a, motorcycle, might, be, pulled, over, and, the, police, may, try, to, fine, him, if, his, motorcycle, is, not, registered, with, the, dmv, if, that, individual, argued, to, the, court, that, a, motorcycle, is, not, a, motor, vehicle, then, the, court, would, have, to, interpret, the, statute, to, determine, what, the, legislature, meant, by, motor, vehicle, and, whether, or, not, the, motorcycle, fell, within, that, definition, and, was, covered, by, the, statute, there, are, numerous, rules, of, statutory, interpretation, the, first, and, most, important, rule, is, the, rule, dealing, with, the, statute, s, plain, language, this, rule, essentially, states, that, the, statute, means, what, it, says, if, for, example, the, statute, says, motor, vehicles, then, the, court, is, most, likely, to, construe, that, the, legislation, is, referring, to, the, broad, range, of, motorised, vehicles, normally, required, to, travel, along, roadways, and, not, aeroplanes, or, bicycles, even, though, aeroplanes, are, vehicles, propelled, by, a, motor, and, bicycles, may, be, used, on, a, roadway, in, australia, and, in, the, united, states, the, courts, have, consistently, stated, that, the, text, of, the, statute, is, used, first, and, it, is, read, as, it, is, written, using, the, ordinary, meaning, of, the, words, of, the, statute, below, are, various, quotes, on, this, topic, from, us, courts, it, is, presumed, that, a, statute, will, be, interpreted, so, as, to, be, internally, consistent, a, particular, section, of, the, statute, shall, not, be, divorced, from, the, rest, of, the, act, the, ejusdem, generis, or, eiusdem, generis, latin, for, of, the, same, kind, rule, applies, to, resolve, the, problem, of, giving, meaning, to, groups, of, words, where, one, of, the, words, is, ambiguous, or, inherently, unclear, the, rule, states, that, where, general, words, follow, enumerations, of, particular, classes, or, persons, or, things, the, general, words, shall, be, construed, as, applicable, only, to, persons, or, things, of, the, same, general, nature, or, kind, as, those, enumerated, a, statute, shall, not, be, interpreted, so, as, to, be, inconsistent, with, other, statutes, where, there, is, an, apparent, inconsistency, the, judiciary, will, attempt, to, provide, a, harmonious, interpretation, legislative, bodies, themselves, may, try, to, influence, or, assist, the, courts, in, interpreting, their, laws, by, placing, into, the, legislation, itself, statements, to, that, effect, these, provisions, have, many, different, names, but, are, typically, noted, as, in, most, legislatures, internationally, these, provisions, of, the, bill, simply, give, the, legislature, s, goals, and, desired, effects, of, the, law, and, are, considered, non, substantive, and, non, enforceable, in, and, of, themselves, however, in, the, case, of, the, european, union, a, supranational, body, the, recitals, in, union, legislation, must, specify, the, reasons, the, operative, provisions, were, adopted, and, if, they, do, not, the, legislation, is, void, this, has, been, interpreted, by, the, courts, as, giving, them, a, role, in, statutory, interpretation, with, klimas, tadas, and, vaiciukaite, explaining, recitals, in, ec, law, are, not, considered, to, have, independent, legal, value, but, they, can, expand, an, ambiguous, provision, s, scope, they, cannot, however, restrict, an, unambiguous, provision, s, scope, but, they, can, be, used, to, determine, the, nature, of, a, provision, and, this, can, have, a, restrictive, effect, also, known, as, canons, of, construction, canons, give, common, sense, guidance, to, courts, in, interpreting, the, meaning, of, statutes, most, canons, emerge, from, the, common, law, process, through, the, choices, of, judges, critics, of, the, use, of, canons, argue, that, the, canons, constrain, judges, and, limit, the, ability, of, the, courts, to, legislate, from, the, bench, proponents, argue, that, a, judge, always, has, a, choice, between, competing, canons, that, lead, to, different, results, so, judicial, discretion, is, only, hidden, through, the, use, of, canons, not, reduced, these, canons, can, be, divided, into, two, major, groups, textual, canons, are, rules, of, thumb, for, understanding, the, words, of, the, text, some, of, the, canons, are, still, known, by, their, traditional, latin, names, substantive, canons, instruct, the, court, to, favor, interpretations, that, promote, certain, values, or, policy, results, deference, canons, instruct, the, court, to, defer, to, the, interpretation, of, another, institution, such, as, an, administrative, agency, or, congress, these, canons, reflect, an, understanding, that, the, judiciary, is, not, the, only, branch, of, government, entrusted, with, constitutional, responsibility, the, avoidance, canon, was, discussed, in, bond, v, united, states, when, the, defendant, placed, toxic, chemicals, on, frequently, touched, surfaces, of, a, friend, the, statute, in, question, made, using, a, chemical, weapon, a, crime, however, the, separation, of, power, between, states, and, the, federal, government, would, be, infringed, upon, if, the, supreme, court, interpreted, the, statute, to, extend, to, local, crimes, therefore, the, court, utilized, the, canon, of, constitutional, avoidance, and, decided, to, read, the, statute, more, narrowly, to, exclude, the, defendant, s, conduct, the, application, of, this, rule, in, the, united, kingdom, is, not, entirely, clear, the, literal, meaning, rule, that, if, parliament, s, meaning, is, clear, that, meaning, is, binding, no, matter, how, absurd, the, result, may, seem, has, a, tension, with, the, golden, rule, permitting, courts, to, avoid, absurd, results, in, cases, of, ambiguity, at, times, courts, are, not, concerned, with, what, parliament, intended, but, simply, with, what, it, has, said, in, the, statute, different, judges, have, different, views, in, nothman, v, london, borough, of, barnet, lord, denning, of, the, court, of, appeals, attacked, those, who, adopt, the, strict, literal, and, grammatical, construction, of, the, words, and, saying, that, the, he, literal, method, is, now, completely, out, of, date, replaced, by, the, purposive, approach, on, appeal, however, against, denning, s, decision, lord, russell, in, the, house, of, lords, disclaim, the, sweeping, comments, of, lord, denning, for, jurisprudence, in, the, united, states, an, absurdity, is, not, mere, oddity, the, absurdity, bar, is, high, as, it, should, be, the, result, must, be, preposterous, one, that, no, reasonable, person, could, intend, moreover, the, avoidance, applies, only, when, it, is, quite, impossible, that, congress, could, have, intended, the, result, and, where, the, alleged, absurdity, is, so, clear, as, to, be, obvious, to, most, anyone, to, justify, a, departure, from, the, letter, of, the, law, upon, that, ground, the, absurdity, must, be, so, gross, as, to, shock, the, general, moral, or, common, sense, with, an, outcome, so, contrary, to, perceived, social, values, that, congress, could, not, have, intended, it, critics, of, the, use, of, canons, argue, that, canons, impute, some, sort, of, omniscience, to, the, legislature, suggesting, that, it, is, aware, of, the, canons, when, constructing, the, laws, in, addition, it, is, argued, that, the, canons, give, a, credence, to, judges, who, want, to, construct, the, law, a, certain, way, imparting, a, false, sense, of, justification, to, their, otherwise, arbitrary, process, in, a, classic, article, karl, llewellyn, argued, that, every, canon, had, a, counter, canon, that, would, lead, to, the, opposite, interpretation, of, the, statute, some, scholars, argue, that, interpretive, canons, should, be, understood, as, an, open, set, despite, conventional, assumptions, that, traditional, canons, capture, all, relevant, language, generalizations, empirical, evidence, for, example, suggests, that, ordinary, people, readily, incorporate, a, nonbinary, gender, canon, and, quantifier, domain, restriction, canon, in, the, interpretation, of, legal, rules, other, scholars, argue, that, the, canons, should, be, reformulated, as, canonical, or, archetypical, queries, helping, to, direct, genuine, inquiry, rather, than, purporting, to, somehow, help, provide, answers, in, themselves, the, common, textual, canons, of, statutory, construction, employed, in, american, jurisprudence, are, the, french, philosopher, montesquieu, 1689, 1755, believed, that, courts, should, act, as, the, mouth, of, the, law, but, soon, it, was, found, that, some, interpretation, is, inevitable, following, the, german, scholar, friedrich, carl, von, savigny, 1779, 1861, the, four, main, interpretation, methods, are, it, is, controversial, whether, there, is, a, hierarchy, between, interpretation, methods, germans, prefer, a, grammatical, literal, interpretation, because, the, statutory, text, has, a, democratic, legitimation, and, sensible, interpretations, are, risky, in, particular, in, view, of, german, history, sensible, means, different, things, to, different, people, the, modern, common, law, perception, that, courts, actually, make, law, is, very, different, in, a, german, perception, courts, can, only, further, develop, law, rechtsfortbildung, all, of, the, above, methods, may, seem, reasonable, the, freedom, of, interpretation, varies, by, area, of, law, criminal, law, and, tax, law, must, be, interpreted, very, strictly, and, never, to, the, disadvantage, of, citizens, but, liability, law, requires, more, elaborate, interpretation, because, here, usually, both, parties, are, citizens, here, the, statute, may, even, be, interpreted, contra, legem, in, exceptional, cases, if, otherwise, a, patently, unreasonable, result, would, follow, the, interpretation, of, international, treaties, is, governed, by, another, treaty, the, vienna, convention, on, the, law, of, treaties, notably, articles, 31, 33, some, states, such, as, the, united, states, are, not, a, parties, to, the, treaty, but, recognize, that, the, convention, is, at, least, in, part, merely, a, codification, of, customary, international, law, the, rule, set, out, in, the, convention, is, essentially, that, the, text, of, a, treaty, is, decisive, unless, it, either, leaves, the, meaning, ambiguous, or, obscure, or, leads, to, a, result, that, is, manifestly, absurd, or, unreasonable, recourse, to, supplementary, means, of, interpretation, is, allowed, only, in, that, case, like, the, preparatory, works, also, known, by, the, french, designation, of, travaux, pr, paratoires, over, time, various, methods, of, statutory, construction, have, fallen, in, and, out, of, favor, some, of, the, better, known, rules, of, construction, methods, are, within, the, united, states, purposivism, and, textualism, are, the, two, most, prevalent, methods, of, statutory, interpretation, also, recognized, is, the, theory, of, intentionalists, which, is, to, prioritize, and, consider, sources, beyond, the, text, purposivists, often, focus, on, the, legislative, process, taking, into, account, the, problem, that, congress, was, trying, to, solve, by, enacting, the, disputed, law, and, asking, how, the, statute, accomplished, that, goal, purposivists, believe, in, reviewing, the, processes, surrounding, the, power, of, the, legislative, body, as, stated, in, the, constitution, as, well, as, the, rationale, that, a, reasonable, person, conversant, with, the, circumstances, underlying, enactment, would, suppress, the, mischief, and, advance, the, remedy, purposivists, would, understand, statutes, by, examining, how, congress, makes, its, purposes, known, through, text, and, reliable, accompanying, materials, constituting, legislative, history, in, contrast, to, purposivists, textualists, focus, on, the, words, of, a, statute, emphasizing, text, over, any, unstated, purpose, textualists, believe, that, everything, which, the, courts, need, in, deciding, on, cases, are, enumerated, in, the, text, of, legislative, statutes, in, other, words, if, any, other, purpose, was, intended, by, the, legislature, then, it, would, have, been, written, within, the, statutes, and, since, it, is, not, written, it, implies, that, no, other, purpose, or, meaning, was, intended, by, looking, at, the, statutory, structure, and, hearing, the, words, as, they, would, sound, in, the, mind, of, a, skilled, objectively, reasonable, user, of, words, textualists, believe, that, they, would, respect, the, constitutional, separation, of, power, and, best, respect, legislative, supremacy, critiques, of, modern, textualism, on, the, united, states, supreme, court, abound, intentionalists, refer, to, the, specific, intent, of, the, enacting, legislature, on, a, specific, issue, intentionalists, can, also, focus, on, general, intent, it, is, important, to, note, that, private, motives, do, not, eliminate, the, common, goal, that, the, legislature, carries, this, theory, differs, from, others, mainly, on, the, types, of, sources, that, will, be, considered, intentional, theory, seeks, to, refer, to, as, many, different, sources, as, possible, to, consider, the, meaning, or, interpretation, of, a, given, statute, this, theory, is, adjacent, to, a, contextualist, theory, which, prioritizes, the, use, of, context, to, determine, why, a, legislature, enacted, any, given, statute
