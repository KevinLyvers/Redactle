a, political, spectrum, is, a, system, to, characterize, and, classify, different, political, positions, in, relation, to, one, another, these, positions, sit, upon, one, or, more, geometric, axes, that, represent, independent, political, dimensions, the, expressions, political, compass, and, political, map, are, used, to, refer, to, the, political, spectrum, as, well, especially, to, popular, two, dimensional, models, of, it, most, long, standing, spectra, include, the, left, right, dimension, as, a, measure, of, social, political, and, economic, hierarchy, which, originally, referred, to, seating, arrangements, in, the, french, parliament, after, the, revolution, 1789, 1799, with, radicals, on, the, left, and, aristocrats, on, the, right, while, communism, and, socialism, are, usually, regarded, internationally, as, being, on, the, left, conservatism, and, reactionism, are, generally, regarded, as, being, on, the, right, liberalism, can, mean, different, things, in, different, contexts, being, sometimes, on, the, left, social, liberalism, and, other, times, on, the, right, conservative, liberalism, or, classical, liberalism, those, with, an, intermediate, outlook, are, sometimes, classified, as, centrists, politics, that, rejects, the, conventional, left, right, spectrum, is, often, known, as, syncretic, politics, this, form, of, politics, has, been, criticized, as, tending, to, mischaracterize, positions, that, have, a, logical, location, on, a, two, axis, spectrum, because, they, seem, randomly, brought, together, on, a, one, axis, left, right, spectrum, some, political, scientists, have, noted, that, a, single, left, right, axis, is, too, simplistic, and, insufficient, for, describing, the, existing, variation, in, political, beliefs, and, include, other, axes, to, compensate, for, this, problem, although, the, descriptive, words, at, polar, opposites, may, vary, the, axes, of, popular, biaxial, spectra, are, usually, split, between, economic, issues, on, a, left, right, dimension, and, socio, cultural, issues, on, an, authority, liberty, dimension, the, terms, right, and, left, refer, to, political, affiliations, originating, early, in, the, french, revolutionary, era, of, 1789, 1799, and, referred, originally, to, the, seating, arrangements, in, the, various, legislative, bodies, of, france, as, seen, from, the, speaker, s, seat, at, the, front, of, the, assembly, the, aristocracy, sat, on, the, right, traditionally, the, seat, of, honor, and, the, commoners, sat, on, the, left, hence, the, terms, right, wing, politics, and, left, wing, politics, originally, the, defining, point, on, the, ideological, spectrum, was, the, ancien, r, gime, old, order, the, right, thus, implied, support, for, aristocratic, or, royal, interests, and, the, church, while, the, left, implied, support, for, republicanism, secularism, and, civil, liberties, because, the, political, franchise, at, the, start, of, the, revolution, was, relatively, narrow, the, original, left, represented, mainly, the, interests, of, the, bourgeoisie, the, rising, capitalist, class, with, notable, exceptions, such, as, the, proto, communist, fran, ois, no, l, babeuf, support, for, laissez, faire, commerce, and, free, markets, were, expressed, by, politicians, sitting, on, the, left, because, these, represented, policies, favorable, to, capitalists, rather, than, to, the, aristocracy, but, outside, parliamentary, politics, these, views, are, often, characterized, as, being, on, the, right, the, reason, for, this, apparent, contradiction, lies, in, the, fact, that, those, to, the, left, of, the, parliamentary, left, outside, official, parliamentary, structures, such, as, the, sans, culottes, of, the, french, revolution, typically, represent, much, of, the, working, class, poor, peasantry, and, the, unemployed, their, political, interests, in, the, french, revolution, lay, with, opposition, to, the, aristocracy, and, so, they, found, themselves, allied, with, the, early, capitalists, however, this, did, not, mean, that, their, economic, interests, lay, with, the, laissez, faire, policies, of, those, representing, them, politically, as, capitalist, economies, developed, the, aristocracy, became, less, relevant, and, were, mostly, replaced, by, capitalist, representatives, the, size, of, the, working, class, increased, as, capitalism, expanded, and, began, to, find, expression, partly, through, trade, unionist, socialist, anarchist, and, communist, politics, rather, than, being, confined, to, the, capitalist, policies, expressed, by, the, original, left, this, evolution, has, often, pulled, parliamentary, politicians, away, from, laissez, faire, economic, policies, although, this, has, happened, to, different, degrees, in, different, countries, especially, those, with, a, history, of, issues, with, more, authoritarian, left, countries, such, as, the, soviet, union, or, china, under, mao, zedong, thus, the, word, left, in, american, political, parlance, may, refer, to, liberalism, and, be, identified, with, the, democratic, party, whereas, in, a, country, such, as, france, these, positions, would, be, regarded, as, relatively, more, right, wing, or, centrist, overall, and, left, is, more, likely, to, refer, to, socialist, or, social, democratic, positioned, rather, than, liberal, ones, for, almost, a, century, social, scientists, have, considered, the, problem, of, how, to, best, describe, political, variation, in, 1950, leonard, w, ferguson, analyzed, political, values, using, ten, scales, measuring, attitudes, toward, birth, control, capital, punishment, censorship, communism, evolution, law, patriotism, theism, treatment, of, criminals, and, war, submitting, the, results, to, factor, analysis, he, was, able, to, identify, three, factors, which, he, named, religionism, humanitarianism, and, nationalism, he, defined, religionism, as, belief, in, god, and, negative, attitudes, toward, evolution, and, birth, control, humanitarianism, as, being, related, to, attitudes, opposing, war, capital, punishment, and, harsh, treatment, of, criminals, and, nationalism, as, describing, variation, in, opinions, on, censorship, law, patriotism, and, communism, this, system, was, derived, empirically, as, rather, than, devising, a, political, model, on, purely, theoretical, grounds, and, testing, it, ferguson, s, research, was, exploratory, as, a, result, of, this, method, care, must, be, taken, in, the, interpretation, of, ferguson, s, three, factors, as, factor, analysis, will, output, an, abstract, factor, whether, an, objectively, real, factor, exists, or, not, although, replication, of, the, nationalism, factor, was, inconsistent, the, finding, of, religionism, and, humanitarianism, had, a, number, of, replications, by, ferguson, and, others, shortly, afterward, hans, eysenck, began, researching, political, attitudes, in, the, united, kingdom, he, believed, that, there, was, something, essentially, similar, about, the, fascism, of, the, national, socialists, nazis, on, the, one, hand, and, the, communists, on, the, other, despite, their, opposite, positions, on, the, left, right, axis, as, hans, eysenck, described, in, his, 1956, book, sense, and, nonsense, in, psychology, eysenck, compiled, a, list, of, political, statements, found, in, newspapers, and, political, tracts, and, asked, subjects, to, rate, their, agreement, or, disagreement, with, each, submitting, this, value, questionnaire, to, the, same, process, of, factor, analysis, used, by, ferguson, eysenck, drew, out, two, factors, which, he, named, radicalism, r, factor, and, tender, mindedness, t, factor, such, analysis, produces, a, factor, whether, or, not, it, corresponds, to, a, real, world, phenomenon, and, so, caution, must, be, exercised, in, its, interpretation, while, eysenck, s, r, factor, is, easily, identified, as, the, classical, left, right, dimension, the, t, factor, representing, a, factor, drawn, at, right, angles, to, the, r, factor, is, less, intuitive, as, high, scorers, favored, pacifism, racial, equality, religious, education, and, restrictions, on, abortion, while, low, scorers, had, attitudes, more, friendly, to, militarism, harsh, punishment, easier, divorce, laws, and, companionate, marriage, according, to, social, scientist, bojan, todosijevic, radicalism, was, defined, as, positively, viewing, evolution, theory, strikes, welfare, state, mixed, marriages, student, protests, law, reform, women, s, liberation, united, nations, nudist, camps, pop, music, modern, art, immigration, abolishing, private, property, and, rejection, of, patriotism, conservatism, was, defined, as, positively, viewing, white, superiority, birching, death, penalty, antisemitism, opposition, to, nationalization, of, property, and, birth, control, tender, mindedness, was, defined, by, moral, training, inborn, conscience, bible, truth, chastity, self, denial, pacifism, anti, discrimination, being, against, the, death, penalty, and, harsh, treatment, of, criminals, tough, mindedness, was, defined, by, compulsory, sterilization, euthanasia, easier, divorce, laws, racism, antisemitism, compulsory, military, training, wife, swapping, casual, living, death, penalty, and, harsh, treatment, of, criminals, despite, the, difference, in, methodology, location, and, theory, the, results, attained, by, eysenck, and, ferguson, matched, simply, rotating, eysenck, s, two, factors, 45, degrees, renders, the, same, factors, of, religionism, and, humanitarianism, identified, by, ferguson, in, america, eysenck, s, dimensions, of, r, and, t, were, found, by, factor, analyses, of, values, in, germany, and, sweden, france, and, japan, one, interesting, result, eysenck, noted, in, his, 1956, work, was, that, in, the, united, states, and, the, united, kingdom, most, of, the, political, variance, was, subsumed, by, the, left, right, axis, while, in, france, the, t, axis, was, larger, and, in, the, middle, east, the, only, dimension, to, be, found, was, the, t, axis, among, mid, eastern, arabs, it, has, been, found, that, while, the, tough, minded, tender, minded, dimension, is, still, clearly, expressed, in, the, relationships, observed, between, different, attitudes, there, is, nothing, that, corresponds, to, the, radical, conservative, continuum, eysenck, s, political, views, related, to, his, research, eysenck, was, an, outspoken, opponent, of, what, he, perceived, as, the, authoritarian, abuses, of, the, left, and, right, and, accordingly, he, believed, that, with, this, t, axis, he, had, found, the, link, between, nazism, and, communism, according, to, eysenck, members, of, both, ideologies, were, tough, minded, central, to, eysenck, s, thesis, was, the, claim, that, tender, minded, ideologies, were, democratic, and, friendly, to, human, freedoms, while, tough, minded, ideologies, were, aggressive, and, authoritarian, a, claim, that, is, open, to, political, criticism, in, this, context, eysenck, carried, out, studies, on, nazism, and, communist, groups, claiming, to, find, members, of, both, groups, to, be, more, dominant, and, more, aggressive, than, control, groups, eysenck, left, nazi, germany, to, live, in, britain, and, was, not, shy, in, attacking, stalinism, citing, the, antisemitic, prejudices, of, the, russian, government, the, luxurious, lifestyles, of, the, soviet, union, leadership, and, the, orwellian, doublethink, of, east, germany, s, naming, itself, the, german, democratic, republic, despite, being, one, of, the, most, undemocratic, regimes, in, the, world, today, while, eysenck, was, an, opponent, of, nazism, his, relationship, with, fascist, organizations, was, more, complex, eysenck, himself, lent, theoretical, support, to, the, english, national, party, which, also, opposed, hitlerite, nazism, and, was, interviewed, in, the, first, issue, of, their, journal, the, beacon, in, relation, to, his, controversial, views, on, relative, intelligence, between, different, races, at, one, point, during, the, interview, eysenck, was, asked, whether, or, not, he, was, of, jewish, origin, before, the, interviewer, proceeded, his, political, allegiances, were, called, into, question, by, other, researchers, notably, steven, rose, who, alleged, that, his, scientific, research, was, used, for, political, purposes, eysenck, s, conception, of, tough, mindedness, has, been, criticized, for, a, number, of, reasons, dissatisfied, with, hans, j, eysenck, s, work, milton, rokeach, developed, his, own, two, axis, model, of, political, values, in, 1973, basing, this, on, the, ideas, of, freedom, and, equality, which, he, described, in, his, book, the, nature, of, human, values, rokeach, claimed, that, the, defining, difference, between, the, left, and, right, was, that, the, left, stressed, the, importance, of, equality, more, than, the, right, despite, his, criticisms, of, eysenck, s, tough, tender, axis, rokeach, also, postulated, a, basic, similarity, between, communism, and, nazism, claiming, that, these, groups, would, not, value, freedom, as, greatly, as, more, conventional, social, democrats, democratic, socialists, and, capitalists, would, and, he, wrote, that, the, two, value, model, presented, here, most, resembles, eysenck, s, hypothesis, to, test, this, model, rokeach, and, his, colleagues, used, content, analysis, on, works, exemplifying, nazism, written, by, adolf, hitler, communism, written, by, vladimir, lenin, capitalism, by, barry, goldwater, and, socialism, written, by, various, authors, this, method, has, been, criticized, for, its, reliance, on, the, experimenter, s, familiarity, with, the, content, under, analysis, and, its, dependence, on, the, researcher, s, particular, political, outlooks, multiple, raters, made, frequency, counts, of, sentences, containing, synonyms, for, a, number, of, values, identified, by, rokeach, including, freedom, and, equality, and, rokeach, analyzed, these, results, by, comparing, the, relative, frequency, rankings, of, all, the, values, for, each, of, the, four, texts, later, studies, using, samples, of, american, ideologues, and, american, presidential, inaugural, addresses, attempted, to, apply, this, model, in, further, research, eysenck, refined, his, methodology, to, include, more, questions, on, economic, issues, doing, this, he, revealed, a, split, in, the, left, right, axis, between, social, policy, and, economic, policy, with, a, previously, undiscovered, dimension, of, socialism, capitalism, s, factor, while, factorially, distinct, from, eysenck, s, previous, r, factor, the, s, factor, did, positively, correlate, with, the, r, factor, indicating, that, a, basic, left, right, or, right, left, tendency, underlies, both, social, values, and, economic, values, although, s, tapped, more, into, items, discussing, economic, inequality, and, big, business, while, r, relates, more, to, the, treatment, of, criminals, and, to, sexual, issues, and, military, issues, most, research, and, political, theory, since, this, time, has, replicated, the, factors, shown, above, another, replication, came, from, ronald, inglehart, s, research, into, national, opinions, based, on, the, world, values, survey, although, inglehart, s, research, described, the, values, of, countries, rather, than, individuals, or, groups, of, individuals, within, nations, inglehart, s, two, factor, solution, took, the, form, of, ferguson, s, original, religionism, and, humanitarianism, dimensions, inglehart, labelled, them, secularism, traditionalism, which, covered, issues, of, tradition, and, religion, like, patriotism, abortion, euthanasia, and, the, importance, of, obeying, the, law, and, authority, figures, and, survivalism, self, expression, which, measured, issues, like, everyday, conduct, and, dress, acceptance, of, diversity, including, foreigners, and, innovation, and, attitudes, towards, people, with, specific, controversial, lifestyles, such, as, homosexuality, and, vegetarianism, as, well, as, willingness, to, engage, in, political, activism, see, for, inglehart, s, national, chart, though, not, directly, related, to, eysenck, s, research, evidence, suggests, there, may, be, as, many, as, 6, dimensions, of, political, opinions, in, the, united, states, and, 10, dimensions, in, the, united, kingdom, this, conclusion, was, based, on, two, large, datasets, and, uses, a, bayesian, approach, rather, than, the, traditional, factor, analysis, method, in, a, 2003, psychological, bulletin, paper, jeff, greenberg, and, eva, jonas, posit, a, model, comprising, the, standard, left, right, axis, and, an, axis, representing, ideological, rigidity, for, greenberg, and, jonas, ideological, rigidity, has, much, in, common, with, the, related, concepts, of, dogmatism, and, authoritarianism, and, is, characterized, by, believing, in, strong, leaders, and, submission, preferring, one, s, own, in, group, ethnocentrism, and, nationalism, aggression, against, dissidents, and, control, with, the, help, of, police, and, military, greenberg, and, jonas, posit, that, high, ideological, rigidity, can, be, motivated, by, particularly, strong, needs, to, reduce, fear, and, uncertainty, and, is, a, primary, shared, characteristic, of, people, who, subscribe, to, any, extreme, government, or, ideology, whether, it, is, right, wing, or, left, wing, in, its, 4, january, 2003, issue, the, economist, discussed, a, chart, proposed, by, ronald, inglehart, and, supported, by, the, world, values, survey, associated, with, the, university, of, michigan, to, plot, cultural, ideology, onto, two, dimensions, on, the, y, axis, it, covered, issues, of, tradition, and, religion, like, patriotism, abortion, euthanasia, and, the, importance, of, obeying, the, law, and, authority, figures, at, the, bottom, of, the, chart, is, the, traditionalist, position, on, issues, like, these, with, loyalty, to, country, and, family, and, respect, for, life, considered, important, while, at, the, top, is, the, secular, position, the, x, axis, deals, with, self, expression, issues, like, everyday, conduct, and, dress, acceptance, of, diversity, including, foreigners, and, innovation, and, attitudes, towards, people, with, specific, controversial, lifestyles, such, as, vegetarianism, as, well, as, willingness, to, engage, in, political, activism, at, the, right, of, the, chart, is, the, open, self, expressionist, position, while, at, the, left, is, its, opposite, position, which, inglehart, calls, survivalist, this, chart, not, only, has, the, power, to, map, the, values, of, individuals, but, also, to, compare, the, values, of, people, in, different, countries, placed, on, this, chart, european, union, countries, in, continental, europe, come, out, on, the, top, right, anglophone, countries, on, the, middle, right, latin, american, countries, on, the, bottom, right, african, middle, eastern, and, south, asian, countries, on, the, bottom, left, and, ex, communist, countries, on, the, top, left, this, very, distinct, two, axis, model, was, created, by, jerry, pournelle, in, 1963, for, his, doctoral, dissertation, in, political, science, the, pournelle, chart, has, liberty, on, one, axis, with, those, on, the, left, seeking, freedom, from, control, or, protections, for, social, deviance, and, those, on, the, right, emphasizing, state, authority, or, protections, for, norm, enforcement, farthest, right, being, state, worship, farthest, left, being, the, idea, of, a, state, as, the, ultimate, evil, the, other, axis, is, rationalism, defined, here, as, the, belief, in, planned, social, progress, with, those, higher, up, believing, that, there, are, problems, with, society, that, can, be, rationally, solved, and, those, lower, down, skeptical, of, such, approaches, in, 2006, brian, patrick, mitchell, identified, four, main, political, traditions, in, anglo, american, history, based, on, their, regard, for, kratos, defined, as, the, use, of, force, and, arch, or, archy, defined, as, the, recognition, of, rank, mitchell, grounded, the, distinction, of, archy, and, kratos, in, the, west, s, historical, experience, of, church, and, state, crediting, the, collapse, of, the, christian, consensus, on, church, and, state, with, the, appearance, of, four, main, divergent, traditions, in, western, political, thought, mitchell, charts, these, traditions, graphically, using, a, vertical, axis, as, a, scale, of, kratos, akrateia, and, a, horizontal, axis, as, a, scale, of, archy, anarchy, he, places, democratic, progressivism, in, the, lower, left, plutocratic, nationalism, in, the, lower, right, republican, constitutionalism, in, the, upper, right, and, libertarian, individualism, in, the, upper, left, the, political, left, is, therefore, distinguished, by, its, rejection, of, archy, while, the, political, right, is, distinguished, by, its, acceptance, of, archy, for, mitchell, anarchy, is, not, the, absence, of, government, but, the, rejection, of, rank, thus, there, can, be, both, anti, government, anarchists, mitchell, s, libertarian, individualists, and, pro, government, anarchists, mitchell, s, democratic, progressives, who, favor, the, use, of, government, force, against, social, hierarchies, such, as, patriarchy, mitchell, also, distinguishes, between, left, wing, anarchists, and, right, wing, anarchists, whom, mitchell, renames, akratists, for, their, opposition, to, the, government, s, use, of, force, from, the, four, main, political, traditions, mitchell, identifies, eight, distinct, political, perspectives, diverging, from, a, populist, center, four, of, these, perspectives, progressive, individualist, paleoconservative, and, neoconservative, fit, squarely, within, the, four, traditions, four, others, paleolibertarian, theoconservative, communitarian, and, radical, fit, between, the, traditions, being, defined, by, their, singular, focus, on, rank, or, force, the, nolan, chart, was, created, by, libertarian, david, nolan, this, chart, shows, what, he, considers, as, economic, freedom, issues, like, taxation, free, trade, and, free, enterprise, on, the, horizontal, axis, and, what, he, considers, as, personal, freedom, issues, like, drug, legalization, abortion, and, the, draft, on, the, vertical, axis, this, puts, left, wingers, in, the, left, quadrant, libertarians, in, the, top, centrists, in, the, middle, right, wingers, in, the, right, and, what, nolan, originally, named, populists, in, the, bottom, several, popular, online, tests, where, individuals, can, self, identify, their, political, values, utilize, the, same, two, axes, as, the, nolan, chart, including, the, political, compass, isidewith, com, and, mapmypolitics, org, the, spatial, model, of, voting, plots, voters, and, candidates, in, a, multi, dimensional, space, where, each, dimension, represents, a, single, political, issue, sub, component, of, an, issue, or, candidate, attribute, voters, are, then, modeled, as, having, an, ideal, point, in, this, space, and, voting, for, the, nearest, candidates, to, that, point, the, dimensions, of, this, model, can, also, be, assigned, to, non, political, properties, of, the, candidates, such, as, perceived, corruption, health, etc, most, of, the, other, spectra, in, this, article, can, then, be, considered, projections, of, this, multi, dimensional, space, onto, a, smaller, number, of, dimensions, for, example, a, study, of, german, voters, found, that, at, least, four, dimensions, were, required, to, adequately, represent, all, political, parties, in, 1998, political, author, virginia, postrel, in, her, book, the, future, and, its, enemies, offered, another, single, axis, spectrum, that, measures, views, of, the, future, contrasting, stasists, who, allegedly, fear, the, future, and, wish, to, control, it, and, dynamists, who, want, the, future, to, unfold, naturally, and, without, attempts, to, plan, and, control, the, distinction, corresponds, to, the, utopian, versus, dystopian, spectrum, used, in, some, theoretical, assessments, of, liberalism, and, the, book, s, title, is, borrowed, from, the, work, of, the, anti, utopian, classic, liberal, theorist, karl, popper, other, proposed, axes, include, as, shown, by, russian, political, scientist, stepan, s, sulakshin, political, spectra, can, be, used, as, a, forecasting, tool, sulakshin, offered, mathematical, evidence, that, stable, development, positive, dynamics, of, the, vast, number, of, statistic, indices, depends, on, the, width, of, the, political, spectrum, if, it, is, too, narrow, or, too, wide, stagnation, or, political, disasters, will, result, sulakshin, also, showed, that, in, the, short, run, the, political, spectrum, determines, the, statistic, indices, dynamic, and, not, vice, versa, a, number, of, studies, have, found, that, biology, can, be, linked, with, political, orientation, many, of, the, studies, linking, biology, to, politics, remain, controversial, and, unreplicated, although, the, overall, body, of, evidence, is, growing, studies, have, found, that, subjects, with, conservative, political, views, have, larger, amygdalae, and, are, more, prone, to, feeling, disgust, liberals, have, larger, volume, of, grey, matter, in, the, anterior, cingulate, cortex, and, are, better, at, detecting, errors, in, recurring, patterns, the, anterior, cingulate, cortex, is, used, when, dealing, with, conflicting, information, a, study, conducted, by, researchers, from, the, university, of, california, los, angeles, ucla, and, new, york, university, nyu, had, participants, sort, through, a, deck, of, cards, the, letter, m, was, four, times, more, likely, to, be, in, the, deck, than, the, letter, w, participants, had, to, press, a, button, every, time, an, m, came, up, in, the, deck, liberals, were, shown, to, make, fewer, errors, in, mistaking, the, w, for, the, m, this, behavioral, study, supported, the, notion, that, liberals, are, better, with, dealing, with, conflicting, information, conservatives, have, a, stronger, sympathetic, nervous, system, response, to, threatening, images, and, are, more, likely, to, interpret, ambiguous, facial, expressions, as, threatening, in, general, conservatives, are, more, likely, to, report, larger, social, networks, more, happiness, and, better, self, esteem, than, liberals, liberals, are, more, likely, to, report, greater, emotional, distress, relationship, dissatisfaction, and, experiential, hardship, and, are, more, open, to, experience, and, tolerate, uncertainty, and, disorder, better, genetic, factors, account, for, at, least, some, of, the, variation, of, political, views, from, the, perspective, of, evolutionary, psychology, conflicts, regarding, redistribution, of, wealth, may, have, been, common, in, the, ancestral, environment, and, humans, may, have, developed, psychological, mechanisms, for, judging, their, own, chances, of, succeeding, in, such, conflicts, these, mechanisms, affect, political, views
