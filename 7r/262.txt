in, europe, in, north, america, in, asia, the, international, atomic, energy, agency, iaea, is, an, intergovernmental, organization, that, seeks, to, promote, the, peaceful, use, of, nuclear, energy, and, to, inhibit, its, use, for, any, military, purpose, including, nuclear, weapons, it, was, established, in, 1957, as, an, autonomous, organization, within, the, united, nations, system, though, governed, by, its, own, founding, treaty, the, organization, reports, to, both, the, general, assembly, and, the, security, council, of, the, united, nations, and, is, headquartered, at, the, un, office, at, vienna, austria, the, iaea, was, created, in, response, to, growing, international, concern, toward, nuclear, weapons, especially, amid, rising, tensions, between, the, foremost, nuclear, powers, the, united, states, and, the, soviet, union, u, s, president, dwight, d, eisenhower, s, atoms, for, peace, speech, which, called, for, the, creation, of, an, international, organization, to, monitor, the, global, proliferation, of, nuclear, resources, and, technology, is, credited, with, catalyzing, the, formation, of, the, iaea, whose, treaty, came, into, force, on, 29, july, 1957, upon, u, s, ratification, the, iaea, serves, as, an, intergovernmental, forum, for, scientific, and, technical, cooperation, on, the, peaceful, use, of, nuclear, technology, and, nuclear, power, worldwide, it, maintains, several, programs, that, encourage, the, development, of, peaceful, applications, of, nuclear, energy, science, and, technology, provide, international, safeguards, against, misuse, of, nuclear, technology, and, nuclear, materials, and, promote, and, implement, nuclear, safety, including, radiation, protection, and, nuclear, security, standards, the, organization, also, conducts, research, in, nuclear, science, and, provides, technical, support, and, training, in, nuclear, technology, to, countries, worldwide, particularly, in, the, developing, world, following, the, ratification, of, the, treaty, on, the, non, proliferation, of, nuclear, weapons, in, 1968, all, non, nuclear, powers, are, required, to, negotiate, a, safeguards, agreement, with, the, iaea, which, is, given, the, authority, to, monitor, nuclear, programs, and, to, inspect, nuclear, facilities, in, 2005, the, iaea, and, its, administrative, head, director, general, mohamed, elbaradei, were, awarded, the, nobel, peace, prize, for, their, efforts, to, prevent, nuclear, energy, from, being, used, for, military, purposes, and, to, ensure, that, nuclear, energy, for, peaceful, purposes, is, used, in, the, safest, possible, way, the, iaea, is, generally, described, as, having, three, main, missions, according, to, article, ii, of, the, iaea, statute, the, objectives, of, the, iaea, are, to, accelerate, and, enlarge, the, contribution, of, atomic, energy, to, peace, health, and, prosperity, throughout, the, world, and, to, ensure, that, assistance, provided, by, it, or, at, its, request, or, under, its, supervision, or, control, is, not, used, in, such, a, way, as, to, further, any, military, purpose, its, primary, functions, in, this, area, according, to, article, iii, are, to, encourage, research, and, development, to, secure, or, provide, materials, services, equipment, and, facilities, for, member, states, and, to, foster, the, exchange, of, scientific, and, technical, information, and, training, three, of, the, iaea, s, six, departments, are, principally, charged, with, promoting, the, peaceful, uses, of, nuclear, energy, the, department, of, nuclear, energy, focuses, on, providing, advice, and, services, to, member, states, on, nuclear, power, and, the, nuclear, fuel, cycle, the, department, of, nuclear, sciences, and, applications, focuses, on, the, use, of, non, power, nuclear, and, isotope, techniques, to, help, iaea, member, states, in, the, areas, of, water, energy, health, biodiversity, and, agriculture, the, department, of, technical, cooperation, provides, direct, assistance, to, iaea, member, states, through, national, regional, and, inter, regional, projects, through, training, expert, missions, scientific, exchanges, and, provision, of, equipment, article, ii, of, the, iaea, statute, defines, the, agency, s, twin, objectives, as, promoting, peaceful, uses, of, atomic, energy, and, ensur, so, far, as, it, is, able, that, assistance, provided, by, it, or, at, its, request, or, under, its, supervision, or, control, is, not, used, in, such, a, way, as, to, further, any, military, purpose, to, do, this, the, iaea, is, authorized, in, article, iii, a, 5, of, the, statute, to, establish, and, administer, safeguards, designed, to, ensure, that, special, fissionable, and, other, materials, services, equipment, facilities, and, information, made, available, by, the, agency, or, at, its, request, or, under, its, supervision, or, control, are, not, used, in, such, a, way, as, to, further, any, military,

in, the, field, of, atomic, energy, the, department, of, safeguards, is, responsible, for, carrying, out, this, mission, through, technical, measures, designed, to, verify, the, correctness, and, completeness, of, states, nuclear, declarations, the, iaea, classifies, safety, as, one, of, its, top, three, priorities, it, spends, 8, 9, percent, of, its, 352, million, euro, 469, million, regular, budget, in, 2011, on, making, plants, secure, from, accidents, its, resources, are, used, on, the, other, two, priorities, technical, co, operation, and, preventing, nuclear, weapons, proliferation, the, iaea, itself, says, that, beginning, in, 1986, in, response, to, the, nuclear, reactor, explosion, and, disaster, near, chernobyl, ukraine, the, iaea, redoubled, its, efforts, in, the, field, of, nuclear, safety, the, iaea, says, that, the, same, happened, after, the, fukushima, disaster, in, fukushima, japan, in, june, 2011, the, iaea, chief, said, he, had, broad, support, for, his, plan, to, strengthen, international, safety, checks, on, nuclear, power, plants, to, help, avoid, any, repeat, of, japan, s, fukushima, crisis, peer, reviewed, safety, checks, on, reactors, worldwide, organized, by, the, iaea, have, been, proposed, in, 1946, united, nations, atomic, energy, commission, was, founded, but, stopped, working, in, 1949, and, was, disbanded, in, 1952, in, 1953, u, s, president, dwight, d, eisenhower, proposed, the, creation, of, an, international, body, to, both, regulate, and, promote, the, peaceful, use, of, atomic, power, nuclear, power, in, his, atoms, for, peace, address, to, the, un, general, assembly, in, september, 1954, the, united, states, proposed, to, the, general, assembly, the, creation, of, an, international, agency, to, take, control, of, fissile, material, which, could, be, used, either, for, nuclear, power, or, for, nuclear, weapons, this, agency, would, establish, a, kind, of, nuclear, bank, the, united, states, also, called, for, an, international, scientific, conference, on, all, of, the, peaceful, aspects, of, nuclear, power, by, november, 1954, it, had, become, clear, that, the, soviet, union, would, reject, any, international, custody, of, fissile, material, if, the, united, states, did, not, agree, to, disarmament, first, but, that, a, clearinghouse, for, nuclear, transactions, might, be, possible, from, 8, to, 20, august, 1955, the, united, nations, held, the, international, conference, on, the, peaceful, uses, of, atomic, energy, in, geneva, switzerland, in, october, 1957, a, conference, on, the, iaea,

2011, russian, nuclear, accident, specialist, iouli, andreev, was, critical, of, the, response, to, fukushima, and, says, that, the, iaea, did, not, learn, from, the, 1986, chernobyl, disaster, he, has, accused, the, iaea, and, corporations, of, wilfully, ignoring, lessons, from, the, world, s, worst, nuclear, accident, 25, years, ago, to, protect, the, industry, s, expansion, the, iaea, s, role, as, an, advocate, for, nuclear, power, has, made, it, a, target, for, protests, the, journal, nature, has, reported, that, the, iaea, response, to, the, 2011, fukushima, daiichi, nuclear, disaster, in, japan, was, sluggish, and, sometimes, confusing, drawing, calls, for, the, agency, to, take, a, more, proactive, role, in, nuclear, safety, but, nuclear, experts, say, that, the, agency, s, complicated, mandate, and, the, constraints, imposed, by, its, member, states, mean, that, reforms, will, not, happen, quickly, or, easily, although, its, ines, emergency, scale, is, very, likely, to, be, revisited, given, the, confusing, way, in, which, it, was, used, in, japan, some, scientists, say, that, the, fukushima, nuclear, accidents, have, revealed, that, the, nuclear, industry, lacks, sufficient, oversight, leading, to, renewed, calls, to, redefine, the, mandate, of, the, iaea, so, that, it, can, better, police, nuclear, power, plants, worldwide, there, are, several, problems, with, the, iaea, says, najmedin, meshkati, of, university, of, southern, california, it, recommends, safety, standards, but, member, states, are, not, required, to, comply, it, promotes, nuclear, energy, but, it, also, monitors, nuclear, use, it, is, the, sole, global, organisation, overseeing, the, nuclear, energy, industry, yet, it, is, also, weighed, down, by, checking, compliance, with, the, nuclear, non, proliferation, treaty, npt, in, 2011, the, journal, nature, reported, that, the, international, atomic, energy, agency, should, be, strengthened, to, make, independent, assessments, of, nuclear, safety, and, that, the, public, would, be, better, served, by, an, iaea, more, able, to, deliver, frank, and, independent, assessments, of, nuclear, crises, as, they, unfold, the, process, of, joining, the, iaea, is, fairly, simple, normally, a, state, would, notify, the, director, general, of, its, desire, to, join, and, the, director, would, submit, the, application, to, the, board, for, consideration, if, the, board, recommends, approval, and, the, general, conference, approves, the, application, for, membership, the, state, must, then, submit, its, instrument, of, acceptance, of, the, iaea, statute, to, the, united, states, which, functions, as, the, depositary, government, for, the, iaea, statute, the, state, is, considered, a, member, when, its, acceptance, letter, is, deposited, the, united, states, then, informs, the, iaea, which, notifies, other, iaea, member, states, signature, and, ratification, of, the, nuclear, non, proliferation, treaty, npt, are, not, preconditions, for, membership, in, the, iaea, the, iaea, has, 178, member, states, most, un, members, and, the, holy, see, are, member, states, of, the, iaea, four, states, have, withdrawn, from, the, iaea, north, korea, was, a, member, state, from, 1974, to, 1994, but, withdrew, after, the, board, of, governors, found, it, in, non, compliance, with, its, safeguards, agreement, and,
