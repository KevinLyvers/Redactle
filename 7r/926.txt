military, ranks, are, a, system, of, hierarchical, relationships, within, armed, forces, police, intelligence, agencies, and, other, institutions, organized, along, military, lines, responsibility, for, personnel, equipment, and, missions, grow, with, each, advancement, the, military, rank, system, defines, dominance, authority, and, responsibility, within, a, military, hierarchy, it, incorporates, the, principles, of, exercising, power, and, authority, into, the, military, chain, of, command, the, succession, of, commanders, superior, to, subordinates, through, which, command, is, exercised, the, military, chain, of, command, is, an, important, component, for, organized, collective, action, uniforms, denote, the, bearer, s, rank, by, particular, insignia, affixed, to, the, uniforms, of, a, number, of, countries, ranking, systems, have, been, known, for, most, of, military, history, to, be, advantageous, for, military, operations, in, particular, with, regards, to, logistics, command, and, coordination, as, time, went, on, and, military, operations, became, larger, and, more, complex, more, ranks, were, created, and, the, systems, of, ranking, became, more, complex, rank, is, not, only, used, to, designate, leadership, but, to, establish, pay, grade, as, well, as, rank, increases, pay, grade, follows, but, so, does, the, amount, of, responsibility, in, modern, armed, forces, the, use, of, ranks, is, almost, universal, communist, states, have, on, several, occasions, abolished, the, use, of, ranks, e, g, the, soviet, red, army, 1918, 1935, the, chinese, people, s, liberation, army, 1965, 1988, and, the, albanian, people, s, army, 1966, 1991, but, they, have, had, to, re, establish, them, after, encountering, operational, difficulties, in, command, and, control, from, 501, bc, the, athenians, annually, elected, ten, individuals, to, the, rank, of, strategos, one, for, each, of, the, ten, tribes, that, had, been, created, with, the, founding, of, the, democracy, strategos, means, army, leader, and, is, usually, translated, as, general, originally, these, generals, worked, together, with, the, old, polemarchos, warlord, but, over, time, the, latter, figure, was, absorbed, into, the, generalship, each, of, the, ten, generals, would, rotate, as, polemarch, for, one, day, and, during, this, day, his, vote, would, serve, as, tie, breaker, if, necessary, the, ten, generals, were, equal, to, one, another, there, was, no, hierarchy, among, them, however, a, basic, form, of, democracy, was, in, effect, for, example, at, the, battle, of, marathon, in, 490, bc, the, generals, determined, the, battle, plan, by, majority, vote, particular, assignments, might, have, been, given, to, individual, generals, inevitably, there, was, a, regular, division, of, responsibilities, the, rank, that, was, subordinate, to, a, top, general, was, a, taxiarchos, or, taxiarhos, something, akin, to, the, modern, brigadier, in, sparta, however, the, title, was, polemarchos, below, this, was, the, syntagmatarchis, which, can, be, translated, as, leader, of, a, regiment, syntagma, and, was, therefore, like, a, modern, colonel, below, him, was, the, tagmatarches, a, commanding, officer, of, a, tagma, near, to, the, modern, battalion, the, rank, was, roughly, equivalent, to, the, legatus, of, a, roman, legion, next, was, the, lokhagos, an, officer, who, led, an, infantry, unit, called, a, lokhos, that, consisted, of, roughly, a, hundred, men, much, the, same, as, in, a, modern, company, led, by, a, captain, a, greek, cavalry, hippikon, regiment, was, called, a, hipparchia, and, was, commanded, by, an, epihipparch, the, unit, was, split, into, two, and, led, by, two, hipparchos, or, hipparch, but, spartan, cavalry, was, led, by, a, hipparmostes, a, hippotoxot, s, was, a, mounted, archer, a, greek, cavalry, company, was, led, by, a, tetrarch, s, or, tetrarch, the, rank, and, file, of, the, military, in, most, of, the, greek, city, states, was, composed, of, ordinary, citizens, heavily, armed, foot, soldiers, were, called, hoplit, s, or, hoplites, and, a, hoplomachos, was, a, drill, or, weapons, instructor, once, athens, became, a, naval, power, the, top, generals, of, the, land, armies, had, authority, over, the, naval, fleets, as, well, under, them, each, warship, was, commanded, by, a, tri, rarchos, or, trierarch, a, word, which, originally, meant, trireme, officer, but, persisted, when, other, types, of, vessels, came, into, use, moreover, as, in, modern, navies, the, different, tasks, associated, with, running, a, ship, were, delegated, to, different, subordinates, specifically, the, kybern, t, s, was, the, helmsman, the, keleust, s, managed, the, rowing, speed, and, the, tri, raul, s, was, the, flute, player, who, maintained, the, strike, rate, for, the, oarsmen, following, further, specialization, the, naval, strategos, was, replaced, by, a, nauarchos, a, sea, officer, equating, to, an, admiral, with, the, rise, of, macedonia, under, philip, ii, of, macedon, and, alexander, the, great, the, greek, military, became, professional, tactics, became, more, sophisticated, and, additional, levels, of, ranking, developed, foot, soldiers, were, organized, into, heavy, infantry, phalanxes, called, phalangites, these, were, among, the, first, troops, ever, to, be, drilled, and, they, fought, packed, in, a, close, rectangular, formation, typically, eight, men, deep, with, a, leader, at, the, head, of, each, column, or, file, and, a, secondary, leader, in, the, middle, so, that, the, back, rows, could, move, off, to, the, sides, if, more, frontage, was, needed, a, tetrarchia, was, a, unit, of, four, files, and, a, tetrarch, s, or, tetrarch, was, a, commander, of, four, files, a, dilochia, was, a, double, file, and, a, dilochit, s, was, a, double, file, leader, a, lochos, was, a, single, file, and, a, lochagos, was, a, file, leader, a, dimoiria, was, a, half, file, and, a, dimoirites, was, a, half, file, leader, another, name, for, the, half, file, was, a, h, milochion, with, a, h, milochit, s, being, a, half, file, leader, different, types, of, units, however, were, divided, differently, and, therefore, their, leaders, had, different, titles, for, example, under, a, numbering, system, by, tens, a, dekas, or, dekania, was, a, unit, of, ten, led, by, a, dekarchos, a, hekatontarchia, was, a, unit, of, one, hundred, led, by, a, hekatontarchos, and, a, khiliostys, or, khiliarchia, was, a, unit, of, a, thousand, led, by, a, khiliarchos, the, cavalry, for, which, alexander, became, most, famous, in, a, military, sense, grew, more, varied, there, were, heavy, cavalry, and, wing, cavalry, il, units, the, latter, commanded, by, an, ilarchos, the, use, of, formalized, ranks, came, into, widespread, use, with, the, roman, legions, after, the, reforms, by, marius, comparisons, to, modern, ranks, however, can, only, be, loose, because, the, roman, army, s, command, structure, was, very, different, from, the, organizational, structure, of, its, modern, counterparts, which, arose, from, the, early, modern, thirty, years, war, mercenary, companies, rather, than, from, the, writings, of, fourth, century, roman, writer, vegetius, and, caesar, s, commentaries, on, his, conquest, of, gaul, and, the, civil, war, military, command, properly, so, called, was, a, political, office, in, rome, a, commander, needed, to, be, equipped, with, imperium, a, politico, religious, concept, the, king, who, possessed, it, the, rex, sacrorum, was, strictly, forbidden, to, have, it, to, avoid, a, return, to, the, monarchy, in, the, republic, commanding, was, confined, to, consuls, or, seldom, to, praetors, or, in, cases, of, necessity, a, dictator, proconsuls, after, the, establishment, of, the, office, were, used, in, imperial, times, each, legion, was, commanded, by, the, emperor, who, was, technically, either, consul, or, proconsul, the, commander, could, appoint, a, deputy, a, so, called, legate, legatus, the, association, of, legatus, with, legion, is, folk, etymology, as, the, meaning, of, legatus, is, proxy, or, envoy, legates, were, typically, drawn, from, the, roman, senate, for, three, year, terms, the, political, nature, of, high, military, command, was, even, reflected, here, in, that, legions, were, always, subordinate, to, the, governor, and, only, the, second, and, further, legions, stationed, in, a, province, had, their, own, legatus, legionis, the, real, commanders, and, the, legates, together, were, in, modern, terms, the, general, officers, immediately, beneath, the, commander, or, his, legate, were, six, military, tribunes, tribuni, militum, five, of, whom, were, young, men, of, equestrian, rank, and, one, of, whom, was, a, nobleman, who, was, headed, for, the, senate, the, latter, is, called, laticlavian, tribune, tribunus, laticlavius, and, was, second, in, command, if, in, modern, divisions, the, deputy, commander, is, a, brigadier, general, the, laticlavian, tribune, can, perhaps, be, translated, with, this, rank, though, he, commanded, no, formation, of, his, own, the, other, tribunes, are, called, tribuni, angusticlavii, and, are, equivalent, to, staff, officers, in, both, senses, of, the, term, of, ranks, major, lieutenant, colonel, colonel, and, with, administrative, duties, they, did, not, command, a, formation, of, their, own, the, term, military, tribune, is, even, sometimes, translated, into, english, as, colonel, most, notably, by, the, late, classicist, robert, graves, in, his, claudius, novels, and, his, translation, of, suetonius, twelve, caesars, to, avoid, confusion, with, the, political, tribunes, of, the, people, in, addition, they, must, not, either, be, confused, with, the, military, tribunes, with, consular, authority, who, in, early, republican, times, could, replace, the, consuls, the, third, highest, officer, of, a, legion, above, the, angusticlavian, tribunes, was, the, praefectus, castrorum, he, too, would, have, a, colonel, s, rank, in, modern, armies, yet, he, differed, much, from, the, tribunes, in, that, his, office, was, not, part, of, the, rather, administrative, cursus, but, normally, filled, by, former, centurions, modern, armies, have, a, similar, distinction, on, a, lower, scale, i, e, between, commissioned, and, non, commissioned, officers, the, fighting, men, in, the, legion, were, formed, into, ranks, rows, of, men, who, fought, as, a, unit, under, marius, s, new, system, legions, were, divided, into, ten, cohorts, cohortes, roughly, equivalent, to, battalions, and, immediately, subject, to, the, legion, each, consisting, of, three, manipula, each, of, them, of, two, centuries, a, rather, small, company, in, modern, terms, each, consisting, of, between, 60, and, 160, men, each, century, was, led, by, a, centurion, centurio, traditionally, translated, as, captain, who, was, assisted, by, a, number, of, junior, officers, such, as, an, optio, centuries, were, further, broken, into, ten, contubernia, of, eight, soldiers, each, the, manipula, were, commanded, by, one, of, their, two, centurions, the, cohorts, by, one, of, their, three, manipulum, s, centurions, the, most, senior, cohort, commanding, centurions, was, called, primus, pilus, the, ranks, of, centurions, in, the, individual, cohorts, were, in, descending, order, pilus, prior, pilus, posterior, princeps, prior, princeps, posterior, hastatus, prior, and, hastatus, posterior, individual, soldiers, were, referred, to, as, soldiers, milites, or, legionaries, legionarii, see, mongol, military, tactics, and, organization, there, were, no, ranks, in, the, modern, sense, of, a, hierarchy, of, titles, although, the, army, was, organized, into, a, hierarchical, command, the, organization, of, the, army, was, based, on, the, decimal, system, employed, by, modun, chanyu, the, army, was, built, upon, a, squad, of, ten, aravt, led, by, an, appointed, chief, ten, of, these, would, then, compose, a, company, of, a, hundred, zuut, also, led, by, an, appointed, chief, the, next, unit, was, a, regiment, of, a, thousand, myangat, led, by, an, appointed, noyan, the, largest, organic, unit, was, a, ten, thousand, man, unit, tumen, also, led, by, an, appointed, noyan, the, army, of, ancient, persia, consisted, of, manageable, military, groupings, under, the, individual, commands, starting, at, the, bottom, a, unit, of, 10, was, called, a, dathabam, and, was, led, by, a, dathapatis, a, unit, of, 100, men,

baivarapatis, the, greeks, called, such, masses, of, troops, a, myrias, or, myriad, among, mounted, troops, an, asabam, was, a, cavalry, unit, led, by, an, asapatis, historians, have, discovered, the, existence, of, the, following, ranks, in, parthian, and, sassanian, armies, post, classical, militaries, did, not, have, a, unified, rank, structure, while, the, feudal, lords, were, in, some, ways, equivalent, to, modern, officers, they, did, not, have, a, strict, hierarchy, a, king, was, conceived, of, as, first, among, equals, not, a, monarch, as, later, or, ancient, societies, understood, the, concept, and, all, nobles, were, theoretically, equals, hence, peers, a, nobleman, was, obligated, to, bring, a, set, number, of, troops, when, asked, by, his, liege, lord, a, king, or, merely, a, higher, ranked, noble, who, had, obtained, his, service, by, the, gift, of, land, the, troops, lord, retained, at, least, nominal, control, over, them, many, post, classical, military, planning, sessions, involved, negotiating, each, lord, s, role, in, the, coming, battle, and, each, lord, was, allowed, to, leave, after, a, predetermined, amount, of, time, had, passed, the, command, structure, of, armies, was, generally, loose, and, varied, considerably, typically, the, king, and, high, ranking, lords, would, call, out, for, all, lords, to, gather, their, troops, for, a, campaign, they, would, appoint, a, renowned, noble, to, organize, the, assembling, forces, the, marshal, the, term, field, marshal, came, from, the, marshal, then, leading, the, army, on, the, march, and, being, in, charge, of, organizing, camps, and, logistics, tactics, for, an, upcoming, battle, were, often, decided, by, councils, of, war, among, the, nobles, leading, the, largest, forces, outside, of, campaigns, the, high, constable, had, authority, over, the, local, constables, and, commanders, of, the, garrisons, of, major, castles, the, high, constable, might, have, authority, in, the, army, due, to, his, role, of, head, of, the, regular, cavalry, as, the, european, and, asian, middle, ages, came, to, an, end, the, rank, structure, of, post, classical, armies, became, more,

was, the, lieutenant, lieutenant, was, derived, from, the, french, language, the, lieu, meaning, place, as, in, a, position, and, tenant, meaning, holding, as, in, holding, a, position, thus, a, lieutenant, is, somebody, who, holds, a, position, in, the, absence, of, their, superior, when, he, was, not, assisting, the, captain, the, lieutenant, commanded, a, unit, called, a, platoon, particularly, a, more, specialized, platoon, the, word, is, derived, from, the, 17th, century, french, peloton, meaning, a, small, ball, or, small, detachment, of, men, which, came, from, pelote, a,

corporal, commanded, a, squad, squad, derived, from, the, italian, word, for, a, square, or, block, of, soldiers, in, fact, corporal, was, derived, from, the, italian, caporal, de, squadra, head, of, the, squad, corporals, were, assisted, by, lancepesades, lancepesades, were, veteran, soldiers, lancepesade, was, derived, from, the, italian, lancia, spezzata, meaning, broken, spear, the, broken, spear, being, a, metaphor, for, combat, experience, where, such, an, occurrence, was, likely, the, first, lancepesades, were, simply, experienced, privates, who, either, assisted, their, corporal, or, performed, the, duties, of, a, corporal, themselves, it, was, this, second, function, that, made, armies, increasingly, regard, their, lancepesades, as, a, grade, of, corporal, rather, than, a, grade, of, private, as, a, result, the, rank, of, lance, corporal, was, derived, from, combining, lancepesade, and, corporal, as, the, post, classical, came, to, an, end, kings, increasingly, relied, on, professional, soldiers, to, fill, the, bottom, ranks, of, their, armies, instead, of, militiamen, each, of, these, professionals, began, their, careers, as, a, private, the, private, was, a, man, who, signed, a, private, contract, with, the, company, commander, offering, his, services, in, return, for, pay, the, money, was, raised, through, taxation, those, yeomen, smallholding, peasants, who, did, not, fulfill, their, annual, 40, day, militia, service, paid, a, tax, that, funded, professional, soldiers, recruited, from, the, yeomanry, this, money, was, handed, to, the, company, commanders,

provinces, a, lieutenant, du, roi, was, sometimes, known, as, a, lieutenant, g, n, ral, to, distinguish, him, from, lieutenants, subordinate, to, mere, captains, the, sergeant, acting, as, staff, officer, to, the, captain, general, was, known, as, the, sergeant, major, general, this, was, eventually, shortened, to, major, general, while, captain, general, began, to, be, addressed, depending, on, the, military, branch, as, general, of, the, infantry, general, of, the, cavalry, or, general, of, the, artillery, and, these, ones, over, time, were, shortened, to, simply, general, this, is, the, reason, a, major, outranks, a, lieutenant, but, a, lieutenant, general, outranks, a, major, general, in, modern, times, recruits, attending, basic, training, also, referred, to, as, boot, camp, by, some, branches, are, instructed, in, the, hierarchical, structure, of, military, rank, many, new, enlisted, civilians, find, it, difficult, to, understand, the, structure, of, general, staff, ranks, as, stated, before, it, becomes, somewhat, complicated, to, understand, when, applying, basic, rationale, as, armies, grew, bigger, heraldry, and, unit, identification, remained, primarily, a, matter, of, the, regiment, brigades, headed, by, brigadier, generals, were, the, units, invented, as, a, tactical, unit, by, the, swedish, king, gustavus, adolphus, ii, gustav, ii, adolf, who, was, killed, at, the, battle, of, l, tzen, 1632, it, was, introduced, to, overcome, the, normal, army, structure, consisting, of, regiments, the, so, called, brigada, was, a, mixed, unit, comprising, infantry, cavalry, and, normally, artillery, designated, for, a, special, task, the, size, of, such, brigada, was, a, reinforced, company, up, to, two, regiments, the, brigada, was, a, 17th, century, form, of, the, modern, task, force, in, some, armies, brigadier, general, has, been, shortened, to, brigadier, around, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, companies, were, grouped, into, regiments, the, officers, commissioned, to, lead, these, regiments, were, called, colonels, column, officers, they, were, first, appointed, in, spain, by, king, ferdinand, ii, of, aragon, where, they, were, also, known, as, coronellos, crown, officers, since, they, were, appointed, by, the, crown, thus, the, english, pronunciation, of, the, word, colonel, the, first, colonels, were, captains, granted, command, of, their, regiments, by, commission, of, the, king, the, lieutenants, of, the, colonel, were, the, lieutenant, colonels, in, the, 17th, century, the, sergeant, of, the, colonel, was, the, sergeant, major, these, were, field, officers, third, in, command, of, their, regiments, after, their, colonels, and, lieutenant, colonels, with, a, role, similar, to, the, older, army, level, sergeants, major, although, on, a, smaller, scale, the, older, position, became, known, as, sergeant, major, general, to, distinguish, it, over, time, the, sergeant, was, dropped, from, both, titles, since, both, ranks, were, used, for, commissioned, officers, this, gave, rise, to, the, modern, ranks, of, major, and, major, general, the, full, title, of, sergeant, major, fell, out, of, use, until, the, latter, part, of, the, 18th, century, when, it, began, to, be, applied, to, the, senior, non, commissioned, officer, of, an, infantry, battalion, or, cavalry, regiment, regiments, were, later, split, into, battalions, with, a, lieutenant, colonel, as, a, commanding, officer, and, a, major, as, an, executive, officer, modern, military, services, recognize, three, broad, categories, of, personnel, these, are, codified, in, the, geneva, conventions, which, distinguish, officers, non, commissioned, officers, and, enlisted, men, apart, from, conscripted, personnel, one, can, distinguish, officers, are, distinguished, from, other, military, members, or, an, officer, in, training, by, holding, a, commission, they, are, trained, or, training, as, leaders, and, hold, command, positions, officers, are, further, generally, separated, into, four, levels, officers, who, typically, command, units, or, formations, that, are, expected, to, operate, independently, for, extended, periods, of, time, i, e, brigades, and, larger, or, flotillas, or, squadrons, of, ships, are, referred, to, variously, as, general, officers, in, armies, marines, and, some, air, forces, flag, officers, in, navies, and, coast, guards, or, air, officers, in, some, commonwealth, air, forces, general, officer, ranks, typically, include, from, the, most, senior, general, lieutenant, general, major, general, and, brigadier, general, although, there, are, many, variations, like, division, general, or, air, ground, force, general, flag, officer, ranks, named, after, the, traditional, practice, of, showing, the, presence, of, such, an, officer, with, a, flag, on, a, ship, and, often, land, typically, include, from, the, most, senior, admiral, vice, admiral, and, rear, admiral, in, some, navies, such, as, canada, s, the, rank, of, commodore, is, a, flag, rank, in, the, united, kingdom, and, most, other, commonwealth, air, forces, air, officer, ranks, usually, include, air, chief, marshal, air, marshal, air, vice, marshal, and, air, commodore, for, some, air, forces, however, such, as, those, of, canada, united, states, and, many, other, air, forces, general, officer, rank, titles, are, used, in, the, case, of, the, united, states, air, force, that, service, was, once, part, of, the, u, s, army, and, evolved, as, a, separate, service, in, 1947, carrying, over, its, extant, officer, rank, structure, brazil, and, argentina, use, a, system, of, general, officer, ranks, based, on, the, term, brigadier, in, some, forces, there, may, be, one, or, more, superior, ranks, to, the, common, examples, above, that, are, given, distinguishing, titles, such, as, field, marshal, most, armies, of, the, world, notably, excluding, the, united, states, or, general, of, the, army, mainly, the, united, states, because, marshal, is, used, as, a, peace, officer, s, designation, fleet, admiral, u, s, navy, marshal, of, the, royal, air, force, or, other, national, air, force, these, ranks, have, often, been, discontinued, such, as, in, germany, and, canada, or, limited, to, wartime, or, honorific, promotion, such, as, in, the, united, kingdom, and, the, united, states, in, various, countries, particularly, the, united, states, these, may, be, referred, to, as, star, ranks, for, the, number, of, stars, worn, on, some, rank, insignia, typically, one, star, for, brigadier, general, or, equivalent, with, the, addition, of, a, star, for, each, subsequent, rank, in, the, united, states, five, stars, has, been, the, highest, rank, regularly, attainable, excluding, the, marines, and, coast, guard, which, have, traditionally, served, as, branches, of, the, navy, in, times, of, war, and, thus, under, the, command, of, a, fleet, admiral, there, also, exists, the, specialty, ranks, of, general, of, the, armies, of, the, united, states, and, admiral, of, the, navy, which, at, their, inception, were, considered, senior, four, star, officers, but, came, to, be, considered, six, star, rank, after, the, creation, of, five, star, officers, to, date, only, one, officer, has, held, a, six, star, rank, in, his, lifetime, john, j, pershing, george, washington, was, posthumously, promoted, to, the, post, in, 1976, additionally, admiral, george, dewey, was, promoted, to, admiral, of, the, navy, but, died, well, before, statute, made, it, senior, to, an, admiral, of, the, fleet, upon, the, latter, s, inception, some, titles, are, not, genuine, ranks, but, either, functions, assumed, by, generals, or, honorific, titles, for, instance, in, the, french, army, g, n, ral, de, corps, d, arm, e, is, a, function, assumed, by, some, g, n, raux, de, division, and, mar, chal, de, france, which, is, a, distinction, denoting, the, most, superior, military, office, but, one, that, has, often, neutered, the, practical, command, powers, of, those, on, whom, it, is, conferred, in, the, united, states, navy, a, commodore, currently, is, a, senior, captain, commanding, a, squadron, air, group, or, air, wing, that, is, too, small, for, a, rear, admiral, to, command, although, that, name, has, historically, been, used, as, a, rank, the, title, not, rank, of, commodore, can, also, indicate, an, officer, who, is, senior, to, a, ship, s, captain, since, only, the, ship, s, commanding, officer, is, addressed, as, captain, while, under, way, marine, captains, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, major, to, distinguish, themselves, while, shipboard, although, this, reference, is, not, employed, in, the, u, s, navy, or, u, s, marine, corps, field, officers, also, called,

battalions, cavalry, or, artillery, regiments, warships, air, squadrons, field, officers, also, commonly, fill, staff, positions, of, superior, commands, the, term, field, grade, officer, is, primarily, used, by, armies, and, marines, air, forces, navies, and, coast, guards, generally, prefer, the, term, senior, officer, the, two, terms, are, not, necessarily, synonymous, because, the, former, is, frequently, used, to, describe, any, officer, who, holds, a, command, position, from, a, platoon, to, a, theater, typical, army, and, marine, field, officer, ranks, include, colonel, lieutenant, colonel, major, and, in, the, british, army, captains, holding, an, adjutant, s, or, operations, officer, appointment, in, many, commonwealth, countries, the, field, rank, of, brigadier, is, used, although, it, fills, the, position, held, by, brigadier, general, in, other, countries, in, the, united, states, army, warrant, officers, who, hold, the, rank, of, cw3, cw4, are, field, grade, officers, cw5s, are, senior, field, grade, officers, naval, and, coast, guard, senior, officer, ranks, include, captain, and, commander, in, some, countries, the, more, senior, rank, of,

some, militaries, however, a, captain, may, act, as, the, permanent, commanding, officer, of, an, independent, company, sized, army, unit, for, example, a, signal, or, field, engineer, squadron, or,
