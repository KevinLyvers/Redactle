fortune, nobel, left, robert, and, ludvig, nobel, were, involved, in, the, oil, business, in, azerbaijan, and, according, to, swedish, historian, e, bargengren, who, accessed, the, nobel, family,

important, task, of, the, nobel, foundation, is, to, market, the, prizes, internationally, and, to, oversee, informal, administration, related, to, the, prizes, the, foundation, is, not, involved, in, the, process, of, selecting, the, nobel, laureates, in, many, ways, the, nobel, foundation, is, similar, to, an, investment, company, in, that, it, invests, nobel, s, money, to, create, a, solid, funding, base, for, the, prizes, and, the, administrative, activities, the, nobel, foundation, is, exempt, from, all, taxes, in, sweden, since, 1946, and, from, investment, taxes, in, the, united, states, since, 1953, since, the, 1980s, the, foundation, s, investments, have, become, more, profitable, and, as, of, 31, december, 2007, the, assets, controlled, by, the, nobel, foundation, amounted, to, 3, 628, billion, swedish, kronor, c, us, 560, million, according, to, the, statutes, the, foundation, consists, of, a, board, of, five, swedish, or, norwegian, citizens, with, its, seat, in,

since, 1995, all, the, members, of, the, board, have, been, chosen, by, the, trustees, and, the, executive, director, and, the, deputy, director, appointed, by, the, board, itself, as, well, as, the, board, the, nobel, foundation, is, made, up, of, the, prize, awarding, institutions, the, royal, swedish, academy, of, sciences, the, nobel, assembly, at, karolinska, institute, the, swedish, academy, and, the, norwegian, nobel, committee, the, trustees, of, these, institutions, and, auditors, the, capital, of, the, nobel, foundation, today, is, invested, 50, in, shares, 20, bonds, and, 30, other, investments, e, g, hedge, funds, or, real, estate, the, distribution, can, vary, by, 10, percent, at, the, beginning, of, 2008, 64, of, the, funds, were, invested, mainly, in, american, and, european, stocks, 20, in, bonds, plus, 12, in, real, estate, and, hedge, funds, in, 2011, the, total, annual, cost, was, approximately, 120, million, kronor, with, 50, million, kronor, as, the, prize, money,

paid, by, the, sveriges, riksbank, once, the, nobel, foundation, and, its, guidelines, were, in, place, the, nobel, committees, began, collecting, nominations, for, the, inaugural, prizes, subsequently, they, sent, a, list, of, preliminary, candidates, to, the, prize, awarding, institutions, the, nobel, committee, s, physics, prize, shortlist, cited, wilhelm, r, ntgen, s, discovery, of, x, rays, and, philipp, lenard, s, work, on, cathode, rays, the, academy, of, sciences, selected, r, ntgen, for, the, prize, in, the, last, decades, of, the, 19th, century, many, chemists, had, made, significant, contributions, thus, with, the, chemistry, prize, the, academy, was, chiefly, faced, with, merely, deciding, the, order, in, which, these, scientists, should, be, awarded, the, prize, the, academy, received, 20, nominations, eleven, of, them, for, jacobus, van, t, hoff, van, t, hoff, was, awarded, the, prize, for, his, contributions, in, chemical, thermodynamics, the, swedish, academy, chose, the, poet, sully, prudhomme, for, the, first, nobel, prize, in, literature, a, group, including, 42, swedish, writers, artists, and, literary, critics, protested, against, this, decision, having, expected, leo, tolstoy, to, be, awarded, some, including, burton, feldman, have, criticised, this, prize, because, they, consider, prudhomme, a, mediocre, poet, feldman, s, explanation, is, that, most, of, the, academy, members, preferred, victorian, literature, and, thus, selected, a, victorian, poet, the, first, physiology, or, medicine, prize, went, to, the, german, physiologist, and, microbiologist, emil, von, behring, during, the, 1890s, von, behring, developed, an, antitoxin, to, treat, diphtheria, which, until, then, had, been, causing, thousands, of, deaths, each, year, the, first, nobel, peace, prize, went, to, the, swiss, jean, henri, dunant, for, his, role, in, founding, the, international, red, cross, movement, and, initiating, the, geneva,

all, later, able, to, receive, the, diploma, and, medal, even, though, sweden, was, officially, neutral, during, the, second, world, war, the, prizes, were, awarded, irregularly, in, 1939, the, peace, prize, was, not, awarded, no, prize, was, awarded, in, any, category, from, 1940, to, 1942, due, to, the, occupation, of, norway, by, germany, in, the, subsequent, year, all, prizes, were, awarded, except, those, for, literature, and, peace, during, the, occupation, of, norway, three, members, of, the, norwegian, nobel, committee, fled, into, exile, the, remaining, members, escaped, persecution, from, the, germans, when, the, nobel, foundation, stated, that, the, committee, building, in, oslo, was, swedish, property, thus, it, was, a, safe, haven, from, the, german, military, which, was, not, at, war, with, sweden, these, members, kept, the, work, of, the, committee, going, but, did, not, award, any, prizes, in, 1944, the, nobel, foundation, together, with, the, three, members, in, exile, made, sure, that, nominations, were, submitted, for, the, peace, prize, and, that, the, prize, could, be, awarded, once, again, in, 1968, sweden, s, central, bank, sveriges, riksbank, celebrated, its, 300th, anniversary, by, donating, a, large, sum, of, money, to, the, nobel, foundation, to, be, used, to, set, up, a, prize, in, honour, of, alfred, nobel, the, following, year, the, sveriges, riksbank, prize, in, economic, sciences, in, memory, of, alfred, nobel, was, awarded, for, the, first, time, the, royal, swedish, academy, of, sciences, became, responsible, for, selecting, laureates, the, first, laureates, for, the, economics, prize, were, jan, tinbergen, and, ragnar, frisch, for, having, developed, and, applied, dynamic, models, for, the, analysis, of, economic, processes, the, board, of, the, nobel, foundation, decided, that, after, this, addition, it, would, allow, no, further, new, prizes, the, award, process, is, similar, for, all, of, the, nobel, prizes, the, main, difference, being, who, can, make, nominations, for, each, of, them, nomination, forms, are, sent, by, the, nobel, committee, to, about, 3, 000, individuals, usually, in, september, the, year, before, the, prizes, are, awarded, these, individuals, are, generally, prominent, academics, working, in, a, relevant, area, regarding, the, peace, prize, inquiries, are, also, sent, to, governments, former, peace, prize, laureates, and, current, or, former, members, of, the, norwegian, nobel, committee, the, deadline, for, the, return, of, the, nomination, forms, is, 31, january, of, the, year, of, the, award, the, nobel, committee, nominates, about, 300, potential, laureates, from, these, forms, and, additional, names, the, nominees, are, not, publicly, named, nor, are, they, told, that, they, are, being, considered, for, the, prize, all, nomination, records, for, a, prize, are, sealed, for, 50, years, from, the, awarding, of, the, prize, the, nobel, committee, then, prepares, a, report, reflecting, the, advice, of, experts, in, the, relevant, fields, this, along, with, the, list, of, preliminary, candidates, is, submitted, to, the, prize, awarding, institutions, there, are, four, awarding, institutions, for, the, six, prizes, awarded, the, institutions, meet, to, choose, the, laureate, or, laureates, in, each, field, by, a, majority, vote, their, decision, which, cannot, be, appealed, is, announced, immediately, after, the, vote, a, maximum, of, three, laureates, and, two, different, works, may, be, selected, per, award, except, for, the, peace, prize, which, can, be, awarded, to, institutions, the, awards, can, only, be, given, to, individuals, the, winners, are, announced, by, the, awarding, institutions, during, the, first, two, weeks, of, october, although, posthumous, nominations, are, not, presently, permitted, individuals, who, died, in, the, months, between, their, nomination, and, the, decision, of, the, prize, committee, were, originally, eligible, to, receive, the, prize, this, has, occurred, twice, the, 1931, literature, prize, awarded, to, erik, axel, karlfeldt, and, the, 1961, peace, prize, awarded, to, un, secretary, general, dag, hammarskj, ld, since, 1974, laureates, must, be, thought, alive, at, the, time, of, the, october, announcement, there, has, been, one, laureate, william, vickrey, who, in, 1996, died, after, the, prize, in, economics, was, announced, but, before, it, could, be, presented, on, 3, october, 2011, the, laureates, for, the, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, were, announced, however, the, committee, was, not, aware, that, one, of, the, laureates, ralph, m, steinman, had, died, three, days, earlier, the, committee, was, debating, about, steinman, s, prize, since, the, rule, is, that, the, prize, is, not, awarded, posthumously, the, committee, later, decided, that, as, the, decision, to, award, steinman, the, prize, was, made, in, good, faith, it, would, remain, unchanged, and, the, prize, would, be, awarded, nobel, s, will, provided, for, prizes, to, be, awarded, in, recognition, of, discoveries, made, during, the, preceding, year, early, on, the, awards, usually, recognised, recent, discoveries, however, some, of, those, early, discoveries, were, later, discredited, for, example, johannes, fibiger, was, awarded, the, 1926, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, for, his, purported, discovery, of, a, parasite, that, caused, cancer, to, avoid, repeating, this, embarrassment, the, awards, increasingly, recognised, scientific, discoveries, that, had, withstood, the, test, of, time, according, to, ralf, pettersson, former, chairman, of, the, nobel, prize, committee, for, physiology, or, medicine, the, criterion, the, previous, year, is, interpreted, by, the, nobel, assembly, as, the, year, when, the, full, impact, of, the, discovery, has, become, evident, the, interval, between, the, award, and, the, accomplishment, it, recognises, varies, from, discipline, to, discipline, the, literature, prize, is, typically, awarded, to, recognise, a, cumulative, lifetime, body, of, work, rather, than, a, single, achievement, the, peace, prize, can, also, be, awarded, for, a, lifetime, body, of, work, for, example, 2008, laureate, martti, ahtisaari, was, awarded, for, his, work, to, resolve, international, conflicts, however, they, can, also, be, awarded, for, specific, recent, events, for, instance, kofi, annan, was, awarded, the, 2001, peace, prize, just, four, years, after, becoming, the, secretary, general, of, the, united, nations, similarly, yasser, arafat, yitzhak, rabin, and, shimon, peres, received, the, 1994, award, about, a, year, after, they, successfully, concluded, the, oslo, accords, a, controversy, was, caused, by, awarding, the, 2009, nobel, peace, prize, to, barack, obama, during, his, first, year, as, us, president, awards, for, physics, chemistry, and, medicine, are, typically, awarded, once, the, achievement, has, been, widely, accepted, sometimes, this, takes, decades, for, example, subrahmanyan, chandrasekhar, shared, the, 1983, physics, prize, for, his, 1930s, work, on, stellar, structure, and, evolution, not, all, scientists, live, long, enough, for, their, work, to, be, recognised, some, discoveries, can, never, be, considered, for, a, prize, if, their, impact, is, realised, after, the, discoverers, have, died, except, for, the, peace, prize, the, nobel, prizes, are, presented, in, stockholm, sweden, at, the, annual, prize, award, ceremony, on, 10, december, the, anniversary,

office, the, lectures, are, organised, by, the, same, association, which, selected, the, laureates, military, cemeteries, in, every, corner, of, the, world, are, silent, testimony, to, the, failure,

various, authors, such, as, salman, rushdie, and, hari, kunzru, and, was, condemned, by, the, governments, of, bosnia, and, herzegovina, kosovo, and, turkey, due, to, his, history, of, bosnian, genocide, denialism, and, his, support, for, slobodan, milo, evi, in, 1949, the, neurologist, ant, nio, egas, moniz, received, the, physiology, or, medicine, prize, for, his, development, of, the, prefrontal, leucotomy, the, previous, year, walter, freeman, had, developed, a, version, of, the, procedure, which, was, faster, and, easier, to, carry, out, due, in, part, to, the, publicity, surrounding, the, original, procedure, freeman, s, procedure, was, prescribed, without, due, consideration, or, regard, for, modern, medical, ethics, endorsed, by, such, influential, publications, as, the, new, england, journal, of, medicine, leucotomy, or, lobotomy, became, so, popular, that, about, 5, 000, lobotomies, were, performed, in, the, united, states, in, the, three, years, immediately, following, moniz, s, receipt, of, the, prize, although, mahatma, gandhi, an, icon, of, nonviolence, in, the, 20th, century, was, nominated, for, the, nobel, peace, prize, five, times, in, 1937, 1938, 1939, 1947, and, a, few, days, before, he, was, assassinated, on, 30, january, 1948, he, was, never, awarded, the, prize, in, 1948, the, year, of, gandhi, s, death, the, norwegian, nobel, committee, decided, to, make, no, award, that, year, on, the, grounds, that, there, was, no, suitable, living, candidate, in, 1989, this, omission, was, publicly, regretted, when, the, 14th, dalai, lama, was, awarded, the, peace, prize, the, chairman, of, the, committee, said, that, it, was, in, part, a, tribute, to, the, memory, of, mahatma, gandhi, geir, lundestad, 2006, secretary, of, norwegian, nobel, committee, said, the, greatest, omission, in, our, 106, year, history, is, undoubtedly, that, mahatma, gandhi, never, received, the, nobel, peace, prize, gandhi, could, do, without, the, nobel, peace, prize, whether, the, nobel, committee, can, do, without, gandhi, is, the, question, other, high, profile, individuals, with, widely, recognised, contributions, to, peace, have, been, overlooked, in, 2009, an, article, in, foreign, policy, magazine, identified, seven, people, who, never, won, the, prize, but, should, have, the, list, consisted, of, gandhi, eleanor, roosevelt, v, clav, havel, ken, saro, wiwa, sari, nusseibeh, corazon, aquino, and, liu, xiaobo, liu, xiaobo, would, go, on, to, win, the, 2010, nobel, peace, prize, while, imprisoned, in, 1965, un, secretary, general, u, thant, was, informed, by, the, norwegian, permanent, representative, to, the, un, that, he, would, be, awarded, that, year, s, prize, and, asked, whether, or, not, he, would, accept, he, consulted, staff, and, later, replied, that, he, would, at, the, same, time, chairman, gunnar, jahn, of, the, nobel, peace, prize, committee, lobbied, heavily, against, giving, u, thant, the, prize, and, the, prize, was, at, the, last, minute, awarded, to, unicef, the, rest, of, the, committee, all, wanted, the, prize, to, go, to, u, thant, for, his, work, in, defusing, the, cuban, missile, crisis, ending, the, war, in, the, congo, and, his, ongoing, work, to, mediate, an, end, to, the, vietnam, war, the, disagreement, lasted, three, years, and, in, 1966, and, 1967, no, prize, was, given, with, gunnar, jahn, effectively, vetoing, an, award, to, u, thant, the, literature, prize, also, has, controversial, omissions, adam, kirsch, has, suggested, that, many, notable, writers, have, missed, out, on, the, award, for, political, or, extra, literary, reasons, the, heavy, focus, on, european, and, swedish, authors, has, been, a, subject, of, criticism, the, eurocentric, nature, of, the, award, was, acknowledged, by, peter, englund, the, 2009, permanent, secretary, of, the, swedish, academy, as, a, problem, with, the, award, and, was, attributed, to, the, tendency, for, the, academy, to, relate, more, to, european, authors, this, tendency, towards, european, authors, still, leaves, many, european, writers, on, a, list, of, notable, writers, that, have, been, overlooked, for, the, literature, prize, including, leo, tolstoy, anton, chekhov, j, r, r, tolkien, mile, zola, marcel, proust, vladimir, nabokov, james, joyce, august, strindberg, simon, vestdijk, karel, apek, the, new, world, s, jorge, luis, borges, ezra, pound, john, updike, arthur, miller, mark, twain, and, africa, s, chinua, achebe, candidates, can, receive, multiple, nominations, the, same, year, gaston, ramon, received, a, total, of, 155, nominations, in, physiology, or, medicine, from, 1930, to, 1953, the, last, year, with, public, nomination, data, for, that, award, as, of, 2016, he, died, in, 1963, without, being, awarded, pierre, paul, mile, roux, received, 115, nominations, in, physiology, or, medicine, and, arnold, sommerfeld, received, 84, in, physics, these, are, the, three, most, nominated, scientists, without, awards, in, the, data, published, as, of, 2016, otto, stern, received, 79, nominations, in, physics, 1925, 1943, before, being, awarded, in, 1943, the, strict, rule, against, awarding, a, prize, to, more, than, three, people, is, also, controversial, when, a, prize, is, awarded, to, recognise, an, achievement, by, a, team, of, more, than, three, collaborators, one, or, more, will, miss, out, for, example, in, 2002, the, prize, was, awarded, to, koichi, tanaka, and, john, fenn, for, the, development, of, mass, spectrometry, in, protein, chemistry, an, award, that, did, not, recognise, the, achievements, of, franz, hillenkamp, and, michael, karas, of, the, institute, for, physical, and, theoretical, chemistry, at, the, university, of, frankfurt, according, to, one, of, the, nominees, for, the, prize, in, physics, the, three, person, limit, deprived, him, and, two, other, members, of, his, team, of, the, honor, in, 2013, the, team, of, carl, hagen, gerald, guralnik, and, tom, kibble, published, a, paper, in, 1964, that, gave, answers, to, how, the, cosmos, began, but, did, not, share, the, 2013, physics, prize, awarded, to, peter, higgs, and, fran, ois, englert, who, had, also, published, papers, in, 1964, concerning, the, subject, all, five, physicists, arrived, at, the, same, conclusion, albeit, from, different, angles, hagen, contends, that, an, equitable, solution, is, to, either, abandon, the, three, limit, restriction, or, expand, the, time, period, of, recognition, for, a, given, achievement, to, two, years, similarly, the, prohibition, of, posthumous, awards, fails, to, recognise, achievements, by, an, individual, or, collaborator, who, dies, before, the, prize, is, awarded, the, economics, prize, was, not, awarded, to, fischer, black, who, died, in, 1995, when, his, co, author, myron, scholes, received, the, honor, in, 1997, for, their, landmark, work, on, option, pricing, along, with, robert, c, merton, another, pioneer, in, the, development, of, valuation, of, stock, options, in, the, announcement, of, the, award, that, year, the, nobel, committee, prominently, mentioned, black, s, key, role, political, subterfuge, may, also, deny, proper, recognition, lise, meitner, and, fritz, strassmann, who, co, discovered, nuclear, fission, along, with, otto, hahn, may, have, been, denied, a, share, of, hahn, s, 1944, nobel, chemistry, award, due, to, having, fled, germany, when, the, nazis, came, to, power, the, meitner, and, strassmann, roles, in, the, research, was, not, fully, recognised, until, years, later, when, they, joined, hahn, in, receiving, the, 1966, enrico, fermi, award, alfred, nobel, left, his, fortune, to, finance, annual, prizes, to, be, awarded, to, those, who, during, the, preceding, year, shall, have, conferred, the, greatest, benefit, on, mankind, he, stated, that, the, nobel, prizes, in, physics, should, be, given, to, the, person, who, shall, have, made, the, most, important, discovery, or, invention, within, the, field, of, physics, nobel, did, not, emphasise, discoveries, but, they, have, historically, been, held, in, higher, respect, by, the, nobel, prize, committee, than, inventions, 77, of, the, physics, prizes, have, been, given, to, discoveries, compared, with, only, 23, to, inventions, christoph, bartneck, and, matthias, rauterberg, in, papers, published, in, nature, and, technoetic, arts, have, argued, this, emphasis, on, discoveries, has, moved, the, nobel, prize, away, from, its, original, intention, of, rewarding, the, greatest, contribution, to, society, in, terms, of, the, most, prestigious, awards, in, stem, fields, only, a, small, proportion, have, been, awarded, to, women, out, of, 210, laureates, in, physics, 181, in, chemistry, and, 216, in, medicine, between, 1901, and, 2018, there, were, only, three, female, laureates, in, physics, five, in, chemistry, and, 12, in, medicine, factors, proposed, to, contribute, to, the, discrepancy, between, this, and, the, roughly, equal, human, sex, ratio, include, biased, nominations, fewer, women, than, men, being, active, in, the, relevant, fields, nobel, prizes, typically, being, awarded, decades, after, the, research, was, done, reflecting, a, time, when, gender, bias, in, the, relevant, fields, was, greater, a, greater, delay, in, awarding, nobel, prizes, for, women, s, achievements, making, longevity, a, more, important, factor, for, women, one, cannot, be, nominated, for, the, nobel, prize, posthumously, and, a, tendency, to, omit, women, from, jointly, awarded, nobel, prizes, despite, these, factors, marie, curie, is, to, date, the, only, person, awarded, nobel, prizes, in, two, different, sciences, physics, in, 1903, chemistry, in, 1911, she, is, one, of,

nobel, prize, that, dishonours, his, relative, alfred, nobel, after, whom, the, prize, is, named, and, considers, economics, to, be, a, pseudoscience, two, laureates, have, voluntarily, declined, the, nobel, prize, in, 1964, jean, paul, sartre, was, awarded, the, literature, prize, but, refused, stating, a, writer, must, refuse, to, allow, himself, to, be, transformed, into, an, institution, even,
