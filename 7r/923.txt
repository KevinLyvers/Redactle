peacekeeping, comprises, activities, especially, military, ones, intended, to, create, conditions, that, favor, lasting, peace, research, generally, finds, that, peacekeeping, reduces, civilian, and, battlefield, deaths, as, well, as, reduces, the, risk, of, renewed, warfare, within, the, united, nations, un, group, of, nation, state, governments, and, organizations, there, is, a, general, understanding, that, at, the, international, level, peacekeepers, monitor, and, observe, peace, processes, in, post, conflict, areas, and, may, assist, ex, combatants, in, implementing, peace, agreement, commitments, that, they, have, undertaken, such, assistance, may, come, in, many, forms, including, confidence, building, measures, power, sharing, arrangements, electoral, support, strengthening, the, rule, of, law, and, economic, and, social, development, accordingly, the, un, peacekeepers, often, referred, to, as, blue, berets, or, blue, helmets, because, of, their, light, blue, berets, or, helmets, can, include, soldiers, police, officers, and, civilian, personnel, the, united, nations, is, not, the, only, organisation, to, implement, peacekeeping, missions, non, un, peacekeeping, forces, include, the, nato, mission, in, kosovo, with, united, nations, authorisation, and, the, multinational, force, and, observers, on, the, sinai, peninsula, or, the, ones, organised, by, the, european, union, like, eufor, rca, with, un, authorisation, and, the, african, union, like, the, african, union, mission, in, sudan, under, international, law, peacekeepers, are, non, combatants, due, to, their, neutral, stance, in, the, conflict, between, two, or, more, belligerent, parties, to, the, same, extent, as, neutral, personnel, and, properties, outside, of, peacekeeping, duties, and, are, to, be, protected, from, attacks, at, all, times, there, is, a, range, of, various, types, of, operations, encompassed, in, peacekeeping, in, page, fortna, s, book, does, peacekeeping, work, for, instance, she, distinguishes, four, different, types, of, peacekeeping, operations, importantly, these, types, of, missions, and, how, they, are, conducted, are, heavily, influenced, by, the, mandate, in, which, they, are, authorized, three, of, fortna, s, four, types, are, consent, based, missions, i, e, so, called, chapter, vi, missions, with, the, fourth, being, a, chapter, vii, mission, chapter, vi, missions, are, consent, based, therefore, they, require, the, consent, of, the, belligerent, factions, involved, in, order, to, operate, should, they, lose, that, consent, peacekeepers, would, be, compelled, to, withdraw, chapter, vii, missions, by, contrast, do, not, require, consent, though, they, may, have, it, if, consent, is, lost, at, any, point, chapter, vii, missions, would, not, be, required, to, withdraw, during, the, cold, war, peacekeeping, was, primarily, interpositional, in, nature, thus, being, referred, to, as, traditional, peacekeeping, un, peacekeepers, were, deployed, in, the, aftermath, of, interstate, conflict, in, order, to, serve, as, a, buffer, between, belligerent, factions, and, ensure, compliance, with, the, terms, of, an, established, peace, agreement, missions, were, consent, based, and, more, often, than, not, observers, were, unarmed, such, was, the, case, with, untso, in, the, middle, east, and, uncip, in, india, and, pakistan, others, were, armed, such, as, unef, i, established, during, the, suez, crisis, they, were, largely, successful, in, this, role, in, the, post, cold, war, era, the, united, nations, has, taken, on, a, more, nuanced, multidimensional, approach, to, peacekeeping, in, 1992, in, the, aftermath, of, the, cold, war, then, secretary, general, boutros, boutros, ghali, put, together, a, report, detailing, his, ambitious, concepts, for, the, united, nations, and, peacekeeping, at, large, the, report, titled, an, agenda, for, peace, described, a, multi, faceted, and, interconnected, set, of, measures, he, hoped, would, lead, to, effective, use, of, the, un, in, its, role, in, post, cold, war, international, politics, this, included, the, use, of, preventative, diplomacy, peace, enforcement, peace, making, peace, keeping, and, post, conflict, reconstruction, in, the, un, record, on, peacekeeping, operations, michael, doyle, and, nicolas, sambanis, summarise, boutros, boutros, report, as, preventative, diplomacy, confidence, building, measures, such, as, fact, finding, missions, observer, mandates, and, the, potential, deployment, of, un, mandated, forces, as, a, preventative, measure, in, order, to, diminish, the, potential, for, violence, or, the, danger, of, violence, occurring, and, thus, increasing, the, prospect, for, lasting, peace, their, definitions, are, as, follows, peacekeeping, also, means, working, together, with, ngos, with, a, view, to, protecting, cultural, property, the, un, peacekeeping, commitment, to, the, protection, of, cultural, heritage, dates, back, to, 2012, and, is, being, expanded, an, outstanding, mission, was, the, deployment, of, the, un, peace, mission, unifil, together, with, blue, shield, international, in, 2019, to, protect, the, unesco, world, heritage, in, lebanon, basically, the, protection, of, cultural, property, carried, out, by, military, and, civil, experts, in, cooperation, with, local, people, forms, the, stable, basis, for, the, future, peaceful, and, economic, development, of, a, city, region, or, country, in, many, conflict, areas, whereby, there, is, also, a, connection, between, cultural, user, disruption, and, the, cause, of, flight, as, president, of, blue, shield, international, karl, von, habsburg, explained, during, the, united, nations, peacekeeping, and, unesco, mission, in, lebanon, in, april, 2019, cultural, assets, are, part, of, the, identity, of, the, people, who, live, in, a, certain, place, if, you, destroy, their, culture, you, also, destroy, their, identity, many, people, are, uprooted, often, have, no, prospects, anymore, and, subsequently, flee, from, their, homeland, not, all, international, peacekeeping, forces, have, been, directly, controlled, by, the, united, nations, in, 1981, an, agreement, between, israel, and, egypt, formed, the, multinational, force, and, observers, which, continues, to, monitor, the, sinai, peninsula, the, african, union, au, is, working, on, building, an, african, peace, and, security, architecture, that, fulfils, the, mandate, to, enforce, peace, and, security, on, the, continent, in, cases, of, genocide, or, other, serious, human, rights, violations, an, au, mission, could, be, launched, even, against, the, wishes, of, the, government, of, the, country, concerned, as, long, as, it, is, approved, by, the, au, general, assembly, the, establishment, of, the, african, peace, and, security, architecture, apsa, which, includes, the, african, standby, force, asf, is, planned, earliest, for, 2015, on, the, regional, level, the, economic, community, of, west, african, states, has, initiated, several, peacekeeping, missions, in, some, of, its, member, states, and, it, has, been, described, as, africa, s, most, advanced, regional, peace, and, security, mechanism, unarmed, civilian, peacekeeping, ucp, are, civilian, personnel, that, carry, out, non, violent, non, interventionist, and, impartial, set, of, tactics, in, order, to, protect, civilians, in, conflict, zones, from, violence, in, addition, to, supporting, additional, efforts, to, build, a, lasting, peace, while, the, term, ucp, is, not, entirely, ubiquitous, among, non, governmental, agencies, ngos, in, the, field, many, utilize, similar, techniques, and, desire, shared, outcomes, for, peace, such, as, accompaniment, presence, rumour, control, community, security, meetings, the, securing, of, safe, passage, and, monitoring, united, nations, peacekeeping, started, in, 1948, when, the, united, nations, security, council, authorised, the, deployment, of, un, unarmed, military, observers, to, the, middle, east, in, order, to, monitor, the, armistice, agreement, that, was, signed, between, israel, and, its, arab, neighbours, in, the, wake, of, the, arab, israeli, war, this, operation, was, called, the, united, nations, truce, supervision, organization, untso, and, is, still, in, operation, today, with, the, passage, of, resolution, 73, 1949, by, the, security, council, in, august, 1949, untso, was, given, the, task, of, fulfilling, four, armistice, agreements, between, the, state, of, israel, and, the, arab, states, which, had, participated, in, the, war, thus, untso, s, operations, were, spread, through, five, states, in, the, region, israel, egypt, jordan, lebanon, and, the, syrian, arab, republic, in, the, wake, of, independence, in, india, and, pakistan, in, august, 1947, and, the, subsequent, bloodshed, that, followed, the, security, council, adopted, resolution, 39, 1948, in, january, 1948, in, order, to, create, the, united, nations, commission, for, india, and, pakistan, uncip, with, the, purpose, of, mediating, the, dispute, between, india, and, pakistan, over, kashmir, and, the, fighting, related, to, it, this, operation, was, non, interventionist, in, nature, and, was, additionally, tasked, with, supervision, of, a, ceasefire, signed, by, pakistan, and, india, in, the, state, of, jammu, and, kashmir, with, the, passage, of, the, karachi, agreement, in, july, 1949, uncip, would, supervise, a, ceasefire, line, that, would, be, mutually, overseen, by, un, unarmed, military, observers, and, local, commanders, from, each, side, in, the, dispute, uncip, s, mission, in, the, region, continues, to, this, day, now, under, the, operational, title, of, the, united, nations, military, observer, group, in, india, and, pakistan, unmogip, since, then, sixty, nine, peacekeeping, operations, have, been, authorised, and, have, deployed, to, various, countries, all, over, the, world, the, great, majority, of, these, operations, have, begun, in, the, post, cold, war, world, between, 1988, and, 1998, thirty, five, un, operations, had, been, established, and, deployed, this, signified, a, substantial, increase, when, compared, with, the, periods, between, 1948, and, 1978, which, saw, the, creation, and, deployment, of, only, thirteen, un, peacekeeping, operations, and, zero, between, 1978, and, 1988, armed, intervention, first, came, in, the, form, of, un, involvement, in, the, wake, of, the, suez, crisis, in, 1956, united, nations, emergency, force, unef, 1, which, existed, from, november, 1956, to, june, 1967, was, essentially, the, first, ever, united, nations, peacekeeping, force, it, was, given, the, mandate, of, ensuring, the, cessation, of, hostilities, between, egypt, the, united, kingdom, france, and, israel, in, addition, to, overseeing, the, withdrawal, of, french, israeli, and, british, troops, from, egyptian, territory, upon, completion, of, said, withdrawal, unef, would, serve, as, a, buffer, force, between, egyptian, and, israeli, forces, in, order, to, supervise, conditions, of, the, ceasefire, and, contribute, to, a, lasting, peace, shortly, thereafter, the, united, nations, operation, in, the, congo, onuc, was, deployed, in, 1960, this, operation, involved, upwards, of, 20, 000, military, personnel, at, its, peak, and, resulted, in, the, death, of, 250, un, personnel, including, then, secretary, general, dag, hammarskjold, onuc, was, meant, to, ensure, the, withdrawal, of, belgian, forces, in, the, congo, who, had, reinserted, themselves, after, congolese, independence, in, the, wake, of, a, revolt, carried, out, by, the, force, publique, fp, in, order, to, protect, belgian, citizens, and, economic, interests, onuc, was, also, tasked, with, establishing, and, maintaining, law, and, order, helping, to, end, the, fp, revolt, and, ethnic, violence, as, well, as, provide, technical, assistance, and, training, to, congolese, security, forces, an, additional, function, was, added, to, onuc, s, mission, in, which, the, force, was, tasked, with, maintaining, the, territorial, integrity, and, political, independence, of, the, congo, resulting, from, the, secession, of, the, mineral, rich, provinces, of, katanga, and, south, kasai, the, un, forces, there, somewhat, controversially, more, or, less, became, an, arm, of, the, congolese, government, at, the, time, and, helped, to, forcefully, end, the, secession, of, both, provinces, throughout, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, the, un, created, multiple, short, term, missions, all, over, the, world, including, the, mission, of, the, representative, of, the, secretary, general, in, the, dominican, republic, domrep, the, un, security, force, in, west, new, guinea, unsf, the, un, yemen, observation, mission, unyom, in, conjunction, with, more, long, term, operations, such, as, the, un, peacekeeping, force, in, cyprus, unficyp, the, un, emergency, force, ii, unef, ii, the, un, disengagement, observer, force, undof, and, the, un, interim, force, in, lebanon, unifil, experiences, of, peacekeeping, during, the, yugoslav, wars, especially, failures, such, as, the, srebrenica, massacre, led, in, part, to, the, united, nations, peacebuilding, commission, which, works, to, implement, stable, peace, through, some, of, the, same, civic, functions, that, peacekeepers, also, work, on, such, as, elections, the, commission, currently, works, with, six, countries, all, in, africa, in, 2013, the, u, n, security, council, unanimously, passed, resolution, 2122, which, among, other, things, calls, for, stronger, measures, regarding, women, s, participation, in, conflict, and, post, conflict, processes, such, as, peace, talks, gender, expertise, in, peacekeeping, missions, improved, information, about, the, impact, of, armed, conflict, on, women, and, more, direct, briefing, to, the, council, on, progress, in, these, areas, also, in, 2013, the, committee, on, the, elimination, of, discrimination, against, women, cedaw, a, un, women, s, rights, committee, said, in, a, general, recommendation, that, states, that, have, ratified, the, un, women, s, rights, convention, are, obliged, to, uphold, women, s, rights, before, during, and, after, conflict, when, they, are, directly, involved, in, fighting, and, or, are, providing, peacekeeping, troops, or, donor, assistance, for, conflict, prevention, humanitarian, aid, or, post, conflict, reconstruction, the, committee, also, stated, that, ratifying, states, should, exercise, due, diligence, in, ensuring, that, non, state, actors, such, as, armed, groups, and, private, security, contractors, be, held, accountable, for, crimes, against, women, one, of, the, findings, of, page, fortna, about, where, peacekeepers, go, is, that, peacekeeping, is, a, matter, of, supply, and, demand, from, the, supply, side, she, observes, that, there, is, unlikely, a, peacekeeping, mission, in, civil, wars, on, countries, close, to, one, of, the, members, of, the, security, council, from, the, demand, side, there, is, diverse, evidence, that, peacekeeping, missions, are, deployed, in, the, countries, who, need, it, the, most, this, is, where, the, risk, of, a, recurring, war, is, high, the, united, nations, charter, stipulates, that, to, assist, in, maintaining, peace, and, security, around, the, world, all, member, states, of, the, un, should, make, available, to, the, security, council, necessary, armed, forces, and, facilities, since, 1948, about, 130, nations, have, contributed, military, and, civilian, police, personnel, to, peace, operations, while, detailed, records, of, all, personnel, who, have, served, in, peacekeeping, missions, since, 1948, are, not, available, it, is, estimated, that, up, to, one, million, soldiers, police, officers, and, civilians, have, served, under, the, un, flag, on, its, 71, missions, as, of, september, 2021, 122, countries, were, contributing, a, total, of, around, 76, 000, military, observers, police, and, troops, despite, the, large, number, of, contributors, the, greatest, burden, continues, to, be, borne, by, a, core, group, of, developing, countries, the, ten, largest, troop, contributing, countries, including, police, and, military, experts, to, un, peacekeeping, operations, as, of, october, 2021, were, bangladesh, 6447, nepal, 5536, india, 5481, rwanda, 5263, ethiopia, 4856, pakistan, 3949, egypt, 2818, indonesia, 2818, ghana, 2296, and, china, 2248, more, than, 14, 000, civilian, personnel, serve, in, peacekeeping, operations, as, legal, or, medical, experts, educators, communication, technology, professionals, or, administrators, as, of, october, 2021, as, of, september, 30, 2021, 4147, people, from, over, 100, countries, have, been, killed, while, serving, on, peacekeeping, missions, india, has, the, highest, number, of, peacekeeper, casualties, with, 174, followed, by, bangladesh, 159, pakistan, 159, nigeria, 157, ghana, 145, ethiopia, 138, canada, 123, france, 115, and, the, united, kingdom, 106, since, 1948, 56, peacekeepers, have, been, killed, each, year, on, average, but, recent, decades, have, seen, this, number, almost, double, with, 110, deaths, per, year, since, 2001, 30, of, the, fatalities, in, the, first, 55, years, of, un, peacekeeping, occurred, between, 1993, and, 1995, there, is, a, strong, north, south, divide, in, peacekeeping, in, that, developing, nations, from, the, global, south, provide, the, overwhelming, majority, of, peacekeepers, thomas, g, weiss, and, giovanna, kuele, argue, that, this, is, due, to, three, factors, regional, interests, prestige, and, financial, benefits, african, countries, are, the, largest, contributors, of, peacekeepers, but, the, continent, also, has, the, highest, number, of, peacekeeping, missions, and, most, african, peacekeepers, serve, on, african, missions, as, an, example, almost, all, 4800, ethiopian, peacekeepers, are, deployed, in, its, neighboring, countries, of, sudan, and, south, sudan, being, a, contributor, to, peacekeeping, missions, also, provides, some, international, prestige, for, developing, countries, and, can, bolster, countries, claims, to, be, a, great, power, as, in, the, case, of, brazil, and, india, lastly, providing, peacekeepers, can, have, financial, benefits, for, poorer, countries, the, monthly, rate, of, reimbursement, per, peacekeeper, includes, 1, 028, for, pay, and, allowances, 303, supplementary, pay, for, specialists, 68, for, personal, clothing, gear, and, equipment, and, 5, for, personal, weaponry, both, the, direct, payments, and, the, training, and, equipment, provided, by, un, peacekeeping, missions, can, be, financially, attractive, to, individual, soldiers, and, developing, nations, about, 4, 5, of, the, troops, and, civilian, police, deployed, in, un, peacekeeping, missions, come, from, the, european, union, and, less, than, one, percent, from, the, united, states, with, regard, to, mission, leadership, force, commanders, often, come, from, large, troop, contributors, while, the, special, representatives, of, the, secretary, general, often, come, from, developed, countries, security, council, resolution, 1325, was, the, first, major, step, taken, by, the, un, to, include, women, as, active, and, equal, actors, in, the, prevention, and, resolution, of, conflicts, peace, negotiations, peace, building, peacekeeping, humanitarian, response, and, in, post, conflict, reconstruction, and, stresses, the, importance, of, their, equal, participation, and, full, involvement, in, all, efforts, for, the, maintenance, and, promotion, of, peace, and, security, a, critique, of, this, resolution, is, that, unscr, 1325, proposes, the, implementing, gender, mainstreaming, however, the, progress, that, has, been, accomplished, in, this, area, has, focused, on, women, rather, than, on, assessing, the, impacts, of, planned, action, on, both, men, and, women, in, 2010, a, comprehensive, 10, year, impact, study, was, conducted, to, assess, the, success, of, this, resolution, and, found, that, there, was, limited, success, with, the, implementation, particularly, in, the, increasing, women, s, participation, in, peace, negotiations, and, peace, agreements, and, sexual, and, gender, based, violence, has, continued, to, be, prevalent, despite, efforts, to, reduce, it, in, 2013, the, u, n, security, council, unanimously, passed, resolution, 2122, which, among, other, things, calls, for, stronger, measures, regarding, women, s, participation, in, conflict, and, post, conflict, processes, such, as, peace, talks, gender, expertise, in, peacekeeping, missions, improved, information, about, the, impact, of, armed, conflict, on, women, and, more, direct, briefing, to, the, council, on, progress, in, these, areas, also, in, 2013, the, committee, on, the, elimination, of, discrimination, against, women, cedaw, a, un, women, s, rights, committee, said, in, a, general, recommendation, that, states, that, have, ratified, the, un, women, s, rights, convention, are, obliged, to, uphold, women, s, rights, before, during, and, after, conflict, when, they, are, directly, involved, in, fighting, and, or, are, providing, peacekeeping, troops, or, donor, assistance, for, conflict, prevention, humanitarian, aid, or, post, conflict, reconstruction, the, committee, also, stated, that, ratifying, states, should, exercise, due, diligence, in, ensuring, that, non, state, actors, such, as, armed, groups, and, private, security, contractors, be, held, accountable, for, crimes, against, women, as, of, july, 2016, women, serve, in, every, un, peacekeeping, mission, either, as, troops, police, or, civilian, staff, in, 1993, women, made, up, 1, of, deployed, uniformed, personnel, in, 2020, out, of, approximately, 95, 000, peacekeepers, women, constituted, 4, 8, of, military, personnel, 10, 9, of, police, personnel, and, 34, of, justice, and, corrections, personnel, in, un, peacekeeping, missions, as, of, september, 2021, no, state, contributing, more, than, 100, un, peacekeepers, nominates, more, than, 25, women, in, absolute, numbers, the, largest, female, contingents, are, provided, by, ethiopia, 578, female, peacekeepers, or, 12, of, its, total, forces, rwanda, 500, 10, and, ghana, 389, 17, while, there, is, no, set, target, for, the, proportion, of, women, among, military, personnel, the, un, is, requesting, contributing, states, to, nominate, a, minimum, of, 20, women, for, policer, officer, positions, and, 30, for, justice, and, corrections, personnel, in, 2023, both, the, number, and, the, proportion, of, women, in, the, military, personnel, of, un, peace, operations, increased, this, trend, has, continued, since, the, launch, of, the, uniformed, gender, parity, strategy, in, june, 2023, women, constituted, 7, 3, of, the, total, military, personnel, deployed, in, un, peace, operations, which, was, an, increase, of, 0, 6, compared, with, the, previous, year, while, much, has, been, written, about, peacekeeping, and, what, peacekeepers, do, very, little, empirical, research, has, taken, place, in, order, to, identify, the, manner, in, which, peacekeepers, can, have, an, impact, in, a, post, conflict, environment, columbia, university, professor, virginia, page, fortna, attempted, to, categorize, four, causal, mechanisms, through, which, peacekeepers, have, the, opportunity, to, lay, the, groundwork, for, a, lasting, peace, fortna, s, four, mechanisms, are, as, follows, fortna, argues, that, peacekeepers, have, a, positive, impact, on, the, peace, process, despite, often, being, sent, to, places, where, peace, is, most, difficult, to, achieve, peacekeeping, is, often, looked, at, by, detractors, as, ineffective, or, unnecessary, peace, prevails, when, belligerents, already, have, a, vested, interest, in, sustaining, peace, and, therefore, it, could, be, argued, that, peacekeepers, play, only, a, minor, role, in, creating, a, strong, foundation, for, enduring, peace, yet, these, causal, reasons, illustrate, the, important, roles, that, peacekeepers, play, in, ensuring, that, peace, lasts, especially, when, contrasted, against, situations, in, which, belligerents, are, left, to, their, own, devices, these, causal, reasons, thus, illustrate, the, need, for, peacekeeping, and, lay, a, foundation, for, the, manner, in, which, peacekeeping, operations, can, have, a, substantive, impact, on, the, post, conflict, environment, in, order, to, change, the, incentives, for, war, and, make, peace, more, appealing, the, un, can, provide, a, military, force, by, way, of, an, enforcement, mandate, which, provides, deterrence, to, would, be, spoilers, they, can, monitor, the, situation, making, the, potential, for, surprise, attack, by, one, of, the, belligerents, less, likely, to, occur, or, by, making, it, more, difficult, to, carry, out, such, an, attack, a, lightly, armed, observer, mission, can, also, serve, as, an, early, warning, force, or, tripwire, for, the, aforementioned, enforcement, mission, aid, and, recognition, provided, to, the, belligerents, by, the, international, community, should, be, made, conditional, and, based, on, compliance, with, objectives, laid, out, in, the, negotiating, process, and, lastly, peace, dividends, should, be, provided, in, the, forms, of, jobs, public, works, and, other, benefits, to, reduce, uncertainty, and, fear, the, un, peacekeeping, force, can, monitor, the, aforementioned, compliance, facilitate, communication, between, belligerents, in, order, to, ease, security, dilemma, concerns, thus, reassuring, belligerents, that, the, other, side, will, not, renege, and, allow, for, belligerents, to, signal, their, legitimate, intentions, for, peace, to, the, other, side, that, is, to, say, provide, a, meaningful, pathway, for, communication, between, both, sides, to, make, their, intentions, known, and, credible, prevention, and, control, of, potential, accidents, that, may, derail, the, peace, process, can, be, achieved, by, the, peacekeeping, force, by, deterring, rogue, groups, belligerent, forces, are, often, undisciplined, without, a, strong, central, source, of, command, and, control, therefore, while, a, peace, is, being, negotiated, there, is, potential, for, a, rogue, group, on, one, side, to, renege, and, spoil, the, peace, process, un, forces, can, serve, to, prevent, this, additionally, the, un, force, can, serve, as, a, moderator, and, make, communication, easy, between, both, parties, and, bring, in, political, moderates, from, either, side, by, providing, law, and, order, un, peacekeeping, forces, can, temporarily, replace, a, state, s, security, forces, and, prevent, a, bias, overreaction, to, an, alleged, violation, by, one, side, which, could, in, turn, result, in, escalation, and, a, renewal, in, the, violence, prevention, of, political, abuse, can, be, achieved, through, the, reformation, of, institutions, associated, with, the, government, training, and, monitoring, the, security, forces, e, g, army, or, police, help, to, make, them, an, unbiased, protector, of, the, people, rather, than, a, weapon, of, suppression, for, the, ruling, government, hopefully, this, training, can, bring, trust, by, the, people, for, the, security, establishment, un, forces, can, also, run, and, monitor, elections, in, order, to, ensure, a, fair, process, in, other, cases, the, un, may, provide, a, neutral, interim, government, to, administer, the, country, during, a, transitional, period, wherein, the, associated, government, institutions, are, being, retrained, reformed, or, better, developed, lastly, military, groups, such, as, armed, rebels, can, be, encouraged, to, put, down, their, weapons, and, transformed, into, political, organisations, using, appropriate, non, violent, means, to, mete, out, their, grievances, and, compete, in, the, election, cycle, this, is, especially, important, as, many, of, these, groups, serve, as, the, chief, opposition, to, a, given, government, but, lack, the, means, or, know, how, to, operate, effectively, as, political, organisations, different, peacekeeping, missions, take, place, as, a, result, of, different, causal, mechanisms, more, military, deterrence, and, enforcement, are, meant, for, those, missions, operating, under, the, auspices, of, chapter, vii, while, chapter, vi, missions, are, meant, to, serve, more, as, monitoring, forces, and, interpositional, operations, are, meant, to, target, and, prevent, potential, political, abuse, these, are, primarily, multidimensional, missions, and, are, heavily, involved, in, the, post, conflict, political, situation, reviews, of, the, academic, literature, show, considerable, evidence, that, peacekeeping, increases, peace, according, to, fortna, there, is, strong, evidence, that, the, presence, of, peacekeepers, significantly, reduces, the, risk, of, renewed, warfare, more, peacekeeping, troops, contribute, to, fewer, battlefield, deaths, and, more, peacekeeping, troops, contribute, to, fewer, civilian, deaths, a, study, by, political, scientists, at, uppsala, university, and, peace, research, institute, oslo, estimates, that, an, ambitious, un, peacekeeping, policy, with, a, doubled, peacekeeping, operation, and, strong, mandates, would, reduce, the, global, incidence, of, armed, conflict, by, two, thirds, relative, to, a, no, pko, scenario, according, to, fordham, university, political, scientist, anjali, dayal, scholars, have, found, that, peacekeeping, keeps, wars, from, bleeding, across, borders, having, more, peacekeepers, on, the, ground, also, seems, to, correspond, with, fewer, civilians, targeted, with, violence, and, peace, operations, at, times, have, successfully, served, as, transitional, authorities, handing, power, back, to, local, authorities, although, this, is, decreasingly, true, a, 2018, study, found, that, peacekeeping, reduces, the, severity, of, civil, war, on, its, own, but, when, it, is, coupled, with, mediation, the, impact, is, greater, there, is, also, evidence, that, the, promise, to, deploy, peacekeepers, can, help, international, organizations, bring, combatants, to, the, negotiation, table, and, increase, the, likelihood, that, they, will, agree, to, a, cease, fire, by, controlling, for, specific, factors, that, affect, where, peacekeepers, are, deployed, and, what, the, potential, chances, for, peace, are, page, fortna, s, statistical, research, shows, that, there, is, a, statistically, significant, impact, on, lasting, peace, when, peacekeepers, are, deployed, despite, the, fact, that, peacekeepers, are, sent, to, locations, where, peace, is, least, likely, to, succeed, fortna, finds, that, conservative, estimates, suggest, that, the, presence, of, un, peacekeepers, diminishes, the, risk, for, renewed, violence, by, at, least, 55, 60, with, less, conservative, estimates, upwards, of, 75, 85, additionally, her, analysis, concludes, that, there, is, little, difference, in, the, effectiveness, between, chapter, vi, consent, based, missions, and, chapter, vii, enforcement, missions, indeed, enforcement, missions, only, remain, effective, if, the, un, peacekeeping, force, can, prove, and, sustain, their, credibility, in, the, use, of, force, this, stresses, the, importance, of, a, un, mission, maintaining, the, consent, of, the, peacekept, ultimately, fortna, finds, that, peacekeeping, is, an, effective, tool, for, ensuring, a, lasting, peace, especially, compared, to, situations, in, which, belligerents, are, left, to, their, own, devices, utilising, the, previously, mentioned, causal, mechanisms, for, peacekeeping, a, un, peacekeeping, force, can, have, a, substantial, and, substantive, impact, on, sustaining, a, lasting, peace, having, a, relative, consensus, of, the, positive, impact, of, peacekeeping, for, ensuring, a, lasting, peace, fortna, and, howard, suggest, that, the, literature, is, moving, towards, the, study, of, i, the, effectiveness, of, the, types, of, peace, keepers, ii, the, transitional, administrations, iii, the, links, between, peacekeeping, and, democratisation, and, iv, the, perspectives, of, the, peacekept, doyle, and, sambanis, analysis, finds, that, lasting, peace, is, more, likely, after, non, ethnic, wars, in, countries, with, a, relatively, high, level, of, development, in, addition, to, whether, or, not, un, peacekeeping, forces, and, financial, assistance, are, available, they, conclude, that, in, the, short, run, lasting, peace, is, more, dependent, on, a, robust, un, deployment, coupled, with, low, levels, of, hostility, between, belligerents, they, note, that, increased, economic, capacity, can, provide, an, incentive, not, to, renew, hostilities, in, the, long, run, however, economic, capacity, matters, far, more, whereas, the, degree, of, hostility, between, belligerents, is, less, important, as, successful, as, un, deployments, can, be, they, have, inadequately, spurred, independent, economic, development, within, the, countries, where, they, have, intervened, thus, the, un, plays, a, strong, but, indirect, role, and, success, in, lasting, peace, is, predicated, on, the, development, of, institutions, that, support, peace, rather, than, serving, as, a, deterrent, for, renewed, war, other, scholarly, analyses, show, varying, success, rates, for, peacekeeping, missions, with, estimate, ranging, from, 31, percent, to, 85, percent, according, to, a, 2020, study, non, un, peacekeeping, missions, are, as, effective, as, un, peacekeeping, missions, another, 2020, study, found, that, peacekeeping, successfully, protected, civilians, a, 2021, study, in, the, american, journal, of, political, science, found, that, un, peacekeeping, in, south, sudan, had, a, positive, impact, on, the, local, economy, there, are, many, factors, that, can, have, a, negative, impact, on, lasting, peace, such, as, hidden, information, about, the, relative, strength, possessed, by, the, belligerents, a, rebel, group, s, involvement, in, illicit, financing, through, means, such, as, through, the, export, of, diamonds, and, other, minerals, participation, in, the, trafficking, of, drugs, weapons, and, human, beings, whether, or, not, military, victory, was, achieved, by, one, side, the, length, of, the, war, as, well, as, how, costly, it, was, commitment, problems, and, security, dilemma, spirals, experienced, by, both, sides, whether, a, cease, fire, or, treaty, signed, by, the, belligerents, lack, of, transparency, in, the, motives, and, actions, carried, out, by, belligerents, in, the, immediate, aftermath, of, the, conflict, extremist, spoilers, participants, in, the, conflict, that, may, benefit, from, its, continuation, indivisibility, and, more, perhaps, one, of, the, most, statistically, significant, contributors, to, a, lasting, peace, is, whether, or, not, military, victory, was, achieved, by, one, side, according, to, fortna, s, research, civil, wars, in, which, one, side, wins, resulting, in, a, cease, fire, or, truce, have, an, approximately, 85, 90, lower, chance, of, renewed, war, moreover, peace, treaties, further, reduce, the, risk, by, 60, 70, if, a, group, is, funded, by, drugs, diamonds, or, other, illicit, trade, then, there, is, a, substantial, increase, in, the, chance, of, renewed, violence, 100, 250, which, is, to, say, that, in, such, circumstances, war, is, two, to, three, and, a, half, times, more, likely, to, begin, again, while, fortna, finds, that, wars, which, involve, many, factions, are, less, likely, to, resume, doyle, and, sambanis, find, the, opposite, costly, wars, and, wars, fought, along, identity, lines, both, provide, varied, chances, of, the, renewal, of, violence, while, longer, wars, and, peace, established, by, treaty, especially, those, attained, by, military, victory, can, reduce, the, chances, of, another, war, some, commentators, have, highlighted, the, potential, to, leverage, peacekeeping, operations, as, a, mechanism, for, advancing, military, normalisation, michael, edward, walsh, and, jeremy, taylor, have, argued, that, japan, s, peacekeeping, operations, in, south, sudan, provide, those, promoting, japan, s, military, normalisation, with, a, unique, opportunity, to, further, erode, the, country, s, pacifist, constitution, unable, to, accept, the, full, weight, of, modern, peacekeeping, operations, without, fundamental, political, legal, and, social, changes, they, conclude, that, japan, s, peacekeepers, remain, ill, prepared, to, tackle, many, serious, contingencies, requiring, use, of, deadly, force, for, this, reason, they, suggest, that, japan, s, continued, participation, in, un, peacekeeping, operations, might, force, policy, changes, that, ultimately, push, the, country, toward, a, tipping, point, from, which, the, normalisation, of, japan, s, military, will, be, the, only, outcome, diana, muir, appelbaum, has, expressed, concern, that, the, creation, of, a, military, in, fiji, for, the, purpose, of, serving, in, international, peacekeeping, missions, has, produced, a, military, powerful, enough, to, stage, four, coups, d, tat, 1987, 1999, 2000, 2006, and, 2009, and, to, rule, fiji, as, a, military, dictatorship, for, over, two, decades, however, a, 2018, study, published, in, the, journal, of, peace, research, found, that, countries, where, militaries, are, highly, dependent, on, the, funds, they, receive, from, un, peacekeeping, were, less, likely, to, experience, coups, d, tats, than, comparable, countries, less, dependent, on, such, funds, studies, of, peacekeeping, soldiers, show, both, positive, and, negative, effects, a, study, of, 951, us, army, soldiers, assigned, to, bosnia, revealed, that, 77, reported, some, positive, consequences, 63, reported, a, negative, consequence, and, 47, reported, both, the, peacekeepers, are, exposed, to, danger, caused, by, the, warring, parties, and, often, in, an, unfamiliar, climate, this, gives, rise, to, different, mental, health, problems, suicide, and, substance, abuse, as, shown, by, the, percentage, of, former, peacekeepers, with, those, problems, having, a, parent, in, a, mission, abroad, for, an, extended, period, is, also, stressful, to, the, peacekeepers, families, another, viewpoint, raises, the, problem, that, the, peacekeeping, may, soften, the, troops, and, erode, their, combat, ability, as, the, mission, profile, of, a, peacekeeping, contingent, is, totally, different, from, the, profile, of, a, unit, fighting, an, all, out, war, since, the, 1990s, un, peacekeepers, have, been, the, subject, of, numerous, accusations, of, abuse, ranging, from, rape, and, sexual, assault, to, pedophilia, and, human, trafficking, complaints, have, arisen, from, cambodia, east, timor, and, west, africa, in, bosnia, herzegovina, prostitution, associated, with, trafficked, women, skyrocketed, and, often, operated, just, beyond, the, gates, of, u, n, compounds, david, lamb, a, regional, human, rights, officer, in, bosnia, from, 2000, to, 2001, claimed, the, sex, slave, trade, in, bosnia, largely, exists, because, of, the, u, n, peacekeeping, operation, without, the, peacekeeping, presence, there, would, have, been, little, or, no, forced, prostitution, in, bosnia, in, addition, hearing, held, by, the, u, s, house, of, representatives, in, 2002, found, that, members, of, sfor, were, frequenting, bosnian, brothels, and, engaging, in, sex, with, trafficked, women, and, underage, girls, reporters, witnessed, a, rapid, increase, in, prostitution, in, cambodia, mozambique, bosnia, and, kosovo, after, un, and, in, the, case, of, the, latter, two, nato, peacekeeping, forces, moved, in, in, the, 1996, un, study, called, the, impact, of, armed, conflict, on, children, former, first, lady, of, mozambique, gra, a, machel, documented, in, 6, out, of, 12, country, studies, on, sexual, exploitation, of, children, in, situations, of, armed, conflict, prepared, for, the, present, report, the, arrival, of, peacekeeping, troops, has, been, associated, with, a, rapid, rise, in, child, prostitution, gita, sahgal, spoke, out, in, 2004, with, regard, to, the, fact, that, prostitution, and, sex, abuse, crops, up, wherever, humanitarian, intervention, efforts, are, set, up, she, observed, that, the, issue, with, the, un, is, that, peacekeeping, operations, unfortunately, seem, to, be, doing, the, same, thing, that, other, militaries, do, even, the, guardians, have, to, be, guarded, an, investigation, by, prince, zeid, ra, ad, zeid, al, hussein, then, permanent, representative, of, jordan, to, the, united, nations, in, 2006, resulted, in, a, comprehensive, report, which, detailed, some, of, this, abuse, in, detail, particularly, that, which, occurred, in, the, democratic, republic, of, congo, sexual, exploitation, frequently, came, in, the, form, of, prostitution, wherein, some, money, an, average, of, 1, 3, per, encounter, was, exchanged, for, sex, in, other, instances, food, or, jobs, were, utilized, to, ply, women, for, sex, other, young, women, reported, of, rape, disguised, as, prostitution, whereabouts, peacekeepers, would, rape, them, and, were, then, given, some, money, or, food, in, order, to, make, the, act, seem, consensual, between, may, and, september, 2004, there, were, seventy, two, allegations, of, sexual, exploitation, 68, against, military, and, 4, against, civilian, personnel, by, the, end, of, 2004, there, would, be, a, total, of, 105, allegations, the, majority, of, these, allegations, were, in, regards, to, sex, with, person, under, the, age, of, 18, years, 45, percent, and, sex, with, adult, prostitutes, 31, percent, rape, and, sexual, assault, made, up, approximately, 13, and, 5, percent, respectively, with, the, remaining, 6, percent, of, allegations, relating, to, other, forms, of, sexual, exploitation, most, of, the, allegations, were, against, peacekeepers, from, pakistan, uruguay, morocco, tunisia, south, africa, and, nepal, uruguayan, president, jose, mujica, apologized, to, haitian, president, michel, martelly, over, the, alleged, rape, of, an, 18, year, old, haitian, man, by, uruguayan, un, peacekeeping, troops, martelly, said, a, collective, rape, carried, out, against, a, young, haitian, would, not, go, unpunished, four, soldiers, suspected, of, being, involved, in, the, rape, have, been, detained, in, july, 2007, the, united, nations, department, of, peacekeeping, operations, dpko, confined, an, entire, contingent, of, 734, moroccans, in, the, ivory, coast, in, the, wake, of, allegations, that, some, had, sexually, abused, underage, girls, in, the, following, years, there, were, 80, investigations, carried, out, by, the, un, office, of, internal, oversight, services, oios, in, 2013, allegations, were, levelled, on, personnel, from, france, gabon, and, burundi, operating, in, the, central, african, republic, these, include, accusations, of, sexual, abuse, and, exploitation, of, at, least, 108, from, kemo, prefecture, and, that, the, vast, majority, of, the, cases, involved, minors, in, 2016, more, allegations, of, abuse, were, levelled, on, peacekeepers, operating, in, the, democratic, republic, of, congo, s, eastern, province, of, north, kivu, tanzania, and, the, un, opened, a, joint, inquiry, into, the, alleged, abuse, which, involved, tanzanian, troops, there, have, been, 18, reports, of, sexual, abuse, eight, of, which, involved, minors, sixteen, tanzanian, soldiers, a, malawian, and, a, south, african, are, implicated, in, the, accusations, the, un, reported, in, march, 2016, that, there, was, a, large, increase, in, allegations, which, involved, troops, from, twenty, one, countries, most, of, the, allegations, involved, troops, from, african, countries, including, cameroon, congo, tanzania, benin, burkina, faso, burundi, ghana, madagascar, niger, nigeria, rwanda, senegal, and, togo, significant, scientific, evidence, first, reported, by, the, associated, press, and, later, the, new, york, times, al, jazeera, and, abc, news, has, shown, that, nepalese, peacekeeping, troops, stationed, at, a, remote, base, in, mirebalais, haiti, triggered, a, deadly, cholera, epidemic, that, has, ravaged, the, country, since, october, 2010, cholera, is, a, waterborne, disease, that, causes, diarrhoea, and, vomiting, and, it, can, kill, in, a, matter, of, hours, if, patients, do, not, receive, rehydration, intervention, as, of, july, 2012, haiti, s, cholera, epidemic, was, the, worst, in, the, world, about, 7, 500, had, died, and, about, 585, 000, haitians, about, 1, in, every, 20, haitians, had, become, ill, with, the, disease, according, to, the, un, appointed, independent, panel, of, experts, on, the, cholera, outbreak, in, haiti, the, conditions, at, the, peacekeeping, base, were, unsafe, and, allowed, contamination, of, haiti, s, river, systems, in, at, least, two, ways, the, construction, of, the, water, pipes, in, the, main, toilet, showering, area, haphazard, with, significant, potential, for, cross, contamination, especially, from, pipes, that, run, over, an, open, drainage, ditch, that, runs, throughout, the, camp, and, flows, directly, into, the, meye, tributary, system, additionally, the, panel, reported, that, on, a, regular, basis, black, water, waste, from, the, mirebalais, base, and, two, other, bases, was, deposited, in, an, open, unfenced, septic, pit, that, was, susceptible, to, flooding, and, would, overflow, into, the, meye, tributary, during, rainfall, in, november, 2011, over, 5, 000, victims, of, the, cholera, epidemic, filed, a, claim, with, the, un, s, internal, claims, mechanism, seeking, redress, in, the, form, of, clean, water, and, sanitation, infrastructure, necessary, to, control, the, epidemic, compensation, for, individual, losses, and, an, apology, in, july, 2012, 104, members, of, the, united, states, congress, signed, a, letter, affirming, that, the, actions, of, the, un, had, brought, cholera, to, haiti, and, that, the, un, should, confront, and, ultimately, eliminate, cholera, in, 2013, the, un, rejected, the, claim, and, the, victims, lawyers, have, pledged, to, sue, the, un, in, court, there, is, a, notable, intermingling, of, varied, cultures, when, it, comes, to, peacekeeping, from, the, vast, number, of, troops, police, and, personnel, that, are, brought, together, from, various, contributing, countries, to, the, oftentimes, challenging, ethnic, regions, which, peacekeeping, forces, are, often, deployed, because, of, these, varied, cultures, complicated, cultural, interactions, take, place, which, not, only, affect, mission, effectiveness, but, can, also, lead, to, friction, with, the, population, the, peacekeepers, are, meant, to, be, assisting, in, most, cases, prior, to, 1988, specific, countries, often, provided, peacekeepers, at, that, point, only, twenty, six, countries, had, sent, personnel, to, participate, in, peacekeeping, deployments, today, that, number, has, risen, to, more, than, eighty, this, results, in, an, extremely, heterogeneous, group, thus, un, peacekeeping, deployments, must, not, only, contend, with, language, complications, but, also, myriad, cultural, and, social, differences, that, can, create, operational, difficulties, that, are, hard, to, overcome, these, differences, can, create, problems, with, regard, to, interactions, whether, personal, or, between, institutions, units, misunderstandings, inadvertent, offensive, behaviour, and, prejudices, that, may, be, associated, with, a, particular, contingent, from, a, given, country, in, terms, of, operations, effectiveness, can, be, hindered, by, the, varying, tactics, techniques, and, procedures, employed, by, the, military, or, police, personnel, that, are, a, part, of, a, given, deployment, because, un, forces, are, cobbled, together, from, so, many, different, sources, there, is, a, discrepancy, in, capabilities, training, equipment, standards, and, procedures, moreover, substantial, differences, exist, in, the, form, of, command, and, control, between, contributing, members, personnel, in, addition, some, nations, may, not, wish, to, be, subordinated, to, another, complicating, unity, of, command, this, can, lead, to, deep, seated, divisions, between, contingents, within, the, un, force, that, results, in, a, lack, of, mutual, support, between, units, in, the, field, this, can, be, demonstrated, in, the, experiences, of, un, peacekeeping, forces, deployed, to, east, timor, where, the, australians, engaged, in, a, robust, operation, that, maximised, force, protection, in, contrast, to, a, pro, active, heart, and, minds, approach, utilised, by, great, britain, s, ghurka, personnel, maintaining, the, consent, of, the, peacekept, is, an, important, facet, of, modern, peacekeeping, notably, in, bosnia, somalia, and, rwanda, fundamental, principles, of, retaining, that, consent, was, ignored, on, the, grounds, of, a, humanitarian, intervention, reflecting, the, nature, of, an, article, vii, intervention, yet, in, order, to, stress, and, maintain, the, legitimacy, of, an, intervention, it, is, important, that, the, un, s, forces, continue, to, enjoy, the, consent, of, the, population, and, government, of, the, country, to, which, they, were, deployed, this, means, making, the, peacekept, feel, a, part, of, the, process, in, addition, to, important, cultural, knowledge, of, the, area, in, which, peacekeepers, are, operating, in, order, to, reduce, friction, and, provide, for, a, successful, operation, there, has, been, little, study, on, the, interaction, of, cultures, that, exist, within, a, peacekeeping, force, and, the, population, within, which, they, operate, however, in, 1976, galtun, and, hveem, studied, norwegian, personnel, who, participated, in, unef, 1, in, gaza, and, onuc, congo, they, posited, that, knowledge, of, the, culture, and, an, understanding, of, the, inhabitants, in, a, given, country, were, not, only, necessary, but, crucial, for, the, success, of, the, mission, they, found, that, personnel, from, the, norwegian, contingent, wanted, greater, insight, into, the, conflict, and, the, culture, in, which, they, operated, they, also, wanted, more, robust, training, with, regard, to, working, with, people, from, other, countries, yet, the, study, revealed, the, troops, received, very, little, from, briefings, and, that, the, majority, of, the, information, regarding, the, conflict, was, gained, through, the, news, reading, books, or, speaking, with, other, un, personnel, rather, than, any, established, un, training, program, similarly, a, study, conducted, on, the, relations, between, members, of, unifil, and, local, population, in, lebanon, carried, out, by, heiberg, and, holst, all, but, confirmed, the, findings, in, their, example, they, found, that, the, countries, that, were, able, to, integrate, more, fully, with, the, population, and, show, a, depth, of, knowledge, about, the, local, culture, were, more, successful, while, those, that, were, ambitious, but, less, integrated, into, the, local, scene, found, themselves, far, removed, from, the, individuals, with, which, they, were, supposed, to, be, engaged, and, their, success, or, lack, thereof, illustrated, this, only, the, italian, contingent, of, some, 2, 200, people, operated, as, part, of, the, local, environment, and, became, an, active, element, in, restoring, normal, living, conditions, its, soldiers, were, provided, with, the, training, required, to, acquaint, them, with, the, cultural, political, and, social, situation, of, the, people, among, whom, they, worked, operating, in, a, sector, that, contained, approximately, 600, 000, inhabitants, mostly, shi, ites, the, italians, carefully, nurtured, contact, with, the, ordinary, citizens, and, the, political, leaders, in, their, area, while, the, americans, thought, they, were, becoming, involved, in, lebanese, politics, they, entered, into, lebanese, culture, and, history, with, little, or, no, understanding, of, the, way, things, worked, or, didn, t, work, most, americans, did, not, understand, the, subtleties, of, short, term, alliances, the, length, of, memories, and, blood, feuds, the, strength, of, aln, in, arab, culture, nor, the, nuances, of, religious, differences, this, illustrates, the, importance, of, understanding, the, significance, that, culture, plays, in, the, conduct, of, successful, peacekeeping, operations, however, despite, the, existence, of, a, un, training, manual, that, attempts, to, advise, peacekeepers, on, necessary, techniques, there, is, no, unifying, doctrine, or, standardised, procedure, among, peacekeeping, contingents, which, will, ultimately, hinder, the, potential, for, success, throughout, the, duration, of, the, cold, war, external, intervention, and, mediation, in, civil, conflicts, took, on, a, state, centric, mechanism, in, which, sovereignty, was, inviolable, rarely, did, the, international, community, intervene, in, internal, conflicts, involving, a, state, s, government, and, domestic, belligerents, that, opposed, it, since, the, end, of, the, cold, war, however, that, has, changed, today, mediation, by, international, actors, in, civil, conflict, rest, on, a, standardised, resolution, mechanism, that, accords, broadly, equal, standing, to, all, factions, within, a, conflict, and, attempts, to, reach, a, settlement, accepted, by, all, the, end, of, the, cold, war, presented, an, opportunity, to, reshape, the, international, system, this, opportunity, was, afforded, to, the, cold, war, s, victors, that, is, to, say, the, united, states, and, other, western, capitalist, states, governed, by, liberal, democratic, values, that, put, a, premium, on, basic, human, rights, and, democratization, in, the, preceding, decades, the, state, was, the, only, entity, to, receive, special, status, while, there, were, exceptions, such, as, groups, struggling, against, colonial, powers, the, state, possessed, the, ultimate, degree, of, legitimacy, as, a, result, the, international, community, rarely, meddled, with, the, internal, machinations, of, a, given, country, sovereignty, was, not, to, be, violated, and, this, was, a, system, which, benefited, both, superpowers, their, allies, as, well, as, third, world, governments, now, however, with, legitimacy, being, extended, to, non, state, actors, as, well, as, the, opportunity, for, a, minority, to, secede, from, a, given, state, and, form, a, new, country, there, has, been, a, dramatic, shift, in, the, international, status, quo, moreover, the, international, community, s, model, for, conflict, resolution, is, heavily, influenced, by, academic, thought, developed, in, western, countries, this, model, encourages, intervening, in, civil, wars, in, order, to, stop, political, violence, and, come, to, a, negotiated, settlement, which, often, involves, democratising, efforts, critics, such, as, christopher, clapham, and, david, shearer, argue, that, this, intervention, can, provide, mechanisms, for, continued, conflict, to, the, detriment, of, the, civilian, population, clapham, s, argument, is, principally, in, relation, to, the, situation, in, rwanda, leading, up, to, the, genocide, whereas, shearer, focuses, on, the, negative, aspects, of, intervention, primarily, regarding, sierra, leone, which, prevents, total, victory, by, one, side, and, results, in, the, creation, of, asymmetries, between, belligerents, which, opens, the, door, for, continued, bloodshed, in, rwanda, third, party, attempts, at, a, negotiated, settlement, between, the, hutu, and, tutsi, afforded, an, opportunity, for, hutu, extremists, to, prepare, for, the, killing, of, hutu, moderates, and, the, genocide, of, the, tutsi, the, international, community, led, by, regional, states, from, the, organisation, of, african, unity, sought, to, negotiate, a, settlement, and, find, a, solution, for, the, ongoing, ethnic, violence, between, hutu, and, tutsi, via, the, arusha, peace, process, this, process, lasted, just, over, a, year, included, substantial, international, involvement, and, incorporated, many, regional, actors, such, as, tanzania, host, of, the, process, burundi, uganda, and, zaire, while, the, rwandan, patriotic, front, rpf, was, a, major, beneficiary, of, the, arusha, accords, and, was, able, to, redress, many, of, its, grievances, many, of, the, gains, that, it, made, could, have, been, achieved, through, military, action, arusha, according, to, clapham, affected, the, relative, power, of, the, participants, in, the, two, following, ways, a, ceasefire, which, froze, the, distribution, of, territorial, control, at, a, particular, point, and, secondly, the, importance, it, ascribed, to, the, participants, of, the, negotiations, meaning, that, it, froze, the, conflict, and, prevented, continued, territorial, gains, being, made, by, the, rpf, in, addition, to, designating, the, degree, of, importance, with, regard, to, the, factions, within, the, negotiations, a, faction, s, importance, was, weighted, not, on, their, relative, popularity, or, military, strength, but, on, artificial, weight, assigned, by, the, mediators, thus, the, entire, process, served, to, undermine, the, rpf, s, position, while, stalling, their, hitherto, successful, military, campaign, while, allowing, hutu, extremists, to, prepare, for, a, genocide, shearer, argues, that, modern, strategies, that, rely, solely, on, consent, based, negotiations, are, severely, limited, and, that, victory, by, military, means, should, not, be, ignored, he, states, that, a, shift, in, battlefield, fortunes, can, often, bring, one, belligerent, to, the, negotiation, table, and, will, likewise, moderate, their, demands, consent, is, of, great, importance, when, it, comes, to, negotiation, and, mediation, the, current, international, system, and, the, conflict, resolution, model, which, the, international, community, has, utilised, most, since, the, end, of, the, cold, war, puts, a, premium, on, consent, but, shearer, asks, that, if, a, belligerent, uses, negotiations, and, cease, fires, as, a, method, of, delay, in, order, to, allow, them, to, reposition, military, forces, and, continue, fighting, then, should, consent, based, strategies, still, be, pursued, regardless, of, the, potential, for, lengthening, a, conflict, and, the, associated, human, cost, according, to, the, empirical, analysis, cited, by, shearer, past, civil, wars, with, negotiated, settlements, have, had, little, success, he, cites, a, study, from, john, stedman, that, notes, between, 1900, and, 1980, 85, of, civil, wars, were, solved, by, one, side, winning, outright, this, excludes, colonial, wars, 15, percent, ended, as, a, result, of, negotiation, additionally, roy, licklider, s, study, supports, these, conclusions, by, noting, the, following, from, 1945, to, 1989, 58, out, of, a, total, of, 93, civil, conflicts, as, he, categorised, them, were, settled, in, some, form, while, the, remainder, continued, however, only, 14, or, 24, percent, of, those, settled, were, solved, by, negotiation, the, others, 76, percent, ended, with, military, victories, additionally, fighting, resumed, in, seven, of, the, 14, conflict, which, were, initially, ended, by, negotiation, the, overall, success, rate, of, negotiated, settlements, therefore, was, around, 12, percent, out, of, the, internal, wars, that, ended, in, sierra, leone, the, revolutionary, united, front, led, by, foday, sankoh, fought, an, ongoing, and, bloody, civil, war, with, the, government, from, 1991, to, 1996, the, conflict, attracted, little, international, attention, but, managed, to, devastate, the, country, and, destroy, its, economy, neither, belligerent, was, willing, to, concede, or, compromise, on, their, demands, despite, multiple, attempts, at, a, negotiated, settlement, sankoh, would, come, to, the, table, after, the, intervention, of, the, private, military, corporation, executive, outcomes, and, a, reversal, in, the, ruf, s, battlefield, fortunes, in, the, aftermath, the, ruf, was, a, depleted, threat, civilians, were, able, to, return, from, refugee, camps, and, begin, rebuilding, their, lives, but, the, peace, was, fragile, and, negotiations, were, ongoing, the, ruf, was, reluctant, to, put, down, their, arms, concerned, over, potential, retribution, at, the, hands, of, army, units, and, civilian, militias, alike, there, was, a, planned, deployment, of, un, peacekeepers, meant, to, ease, these, concerns, and, help, with, the, transition, to, peace, but, things, began, to, unravel, international, contributors, began, to, shy, away, from, further, peacekeeping, initiatives, such, as, an, expensive, and, open, ended, mission, in, a, strategically, unimportant, country, as, a, result, the, un, s, intervention, force, was, slow, to, come, to, fruition, and, then, came, to, a, halt, completely, when, sankoh, argued, the, size, of, the, contingent, of, 740, un, peacekeepers, was, too, large, the, un, refused, to, engage, without, total, consent, from, both, parties, thus, preventing, the, deployment, of, a, peacekeeping, force, this, consent, based, approach, shearer, argues, illustrates, the, limits, the, un, can, play, in, the, volatile, and, fragile, state, of, affairs, that, exist, during, and, after, civil, wars, in, sierra, leone, it, meant, that, an, important, component, needed, to, shore, up, the, peace, building, process, was, absent, it, also, meant, that, sankoh, was, dictating, terms, this, consent, based, approach, effectively, allowed, the, leadership, of, a, brutal, rebel, group, to, hinder, the, potential, for, peace, the, situation, was, exacerbated, by, the, fact, that, the, newly, elected, president, of, sierra, leone, terminated, the, executive, outcomes, contract, undermining, his, hard, power, advantage, things, were, further, inflamed, when, disaffected, officers, of, the, army, overthrew, the, government, in, 1997, the, war, quickly, renewed, a, small, un, force, of, monitors, was, deployed, to, observe, the, security, situation, unomsil, as, it, was, called, was, deployed, between, july, 1998, and, october, 1999, but, was, forced, to, withdraw, from, the, country, when, the, ruf, took, the, country, s, capitol, unamsil, was, eventually, formed, and, deployed, in, 1999, authorised, under, a, chapter, vii, mandate, it, was, meant, to, enforce, the, lome, agreements, however, violence, would, continue, from, the, outset, the, ruf, was, beyond, uncooperative, and, once, the, ecomog, contingent, withdrew, the, ruf, attacked, un, forces, eventually, taking, hundreds, hostage, this, led, to, an, unexpected, backlash, from, the, international, community, that, the, ruf, did, not, anticipate, its, leadership, had, expected, the, international, community, to, cut, and, run, as, it, had, done, in, somalia, and, earlier, when, unomsil, fled, freetown, instead, with, british, support, an, aggressive, campaign, was, waged, against, the, ruf, unamsil, s, mandate, was, expanded, and, its, manpower, enlarged, by, late, 2000, and, early, 2001, the, ruf, s, military, strength, had, been, severely, depleted, thus, the, abuja, agreements, were, signed, and, unamsil, fulfilled, its, mandate, in, december, 2005, while, sierra, leone, is, at, peace, today, and, the, un, s, mission, can, be, deemed, a, success, the, way, in, which, the, situation, developed, illustrates, shearer, s, point, that, a, consent, based, approach, focused, on, negotiation, that, encompasses, all, belligerents, interest, may, not, necessarily, lead, to, success, as, we, see, fighting, continued, despite, the, presence, of, unomsil, indeed, even, after, unomsil, was, replaced, by, a, more, robust, force, under, a, chapter, vii, mandate, in, the, form, of, unamsil, the, violence, continued, when, the, british, intervened, militarily, and, substantially, degraded, the, ruf, s, capability, to, sustain, the, conflict, as, executive, outcomes, had, done, years, prior, the, ruf, finally, come, to, the, negotiating, table, and, allowed, for, the, establishment, of, peace, some, authors, question, the, idea, of, international, interventions, at, all, in, a, 2005, working, paper, for, the, center, for, global, development, jeremy, weinstein, of, stanford, university, provides, a, theory, of, autonomous, recovery, in, which, states, can, achieve, sustainable, peace, without, international, intervention, using, case, studies, of, uganda, eritrea, and, somalia, weinstein, demonstrates, how, states, can, develop, effective, institutions, out, of, warfare, this, method, has, cost, and, benefits, that, must, be, weighed, against, the, potential, outcome, of, international, intervention, external, intervention, can, stop, mass, atrocities, but, also, stop, institutional, change, autonomous, recovery, elevates, the, strongest, leader, but, also, rewards, the, strongest, fighters, who, may, be, less, inclined, to, share, power, furthermore, intervention, depends, on, external, influence, while, autonomous, recovery, is, based, on, internal, factors, the, conclusions, of, his, argument, could, suggest, intervention, is, not, ideal, policy, but, weinstein, argues, the, international, community, s, responsibility, to, protect, doctrine, has, moral, importance, for, intervention, and, the, conditions, for, autonomous, recovery, are, very, rare, weinstein, argues, the, fundamental, challenge, is, how, to, incentivise, good, governance, and, assistance, to, rebel, groups, without, disrupting, the, connection, of, citizens, to, rulers, in, terms, of, revenue, collection, that, enables, accountability, although, acknowledging, a, number, of, practical, and, moral, reasons, for, peacekeeping, operations, james, fearon, and, david, laitin, assert, that, they, have, a, tendency, under, some, circumstances, to, become, tangled, with, state, building, efforts, in, weak, states, facing, successful, guerrilla, campaigns, peacekeepers, face, pressures, to, build, state, institutional, and, administrative, capacity, in, order, to, achieve, lasting, peace, these, pressures, can, lead, to, mission, creep, beyond, the, original, purview, of, the, peacekeeping, operation, without, engaging, in, state, building, the, peacekeepers, risk, allowing, the, peacekept, country, to, revert, to, violence, following, their, exit, thus, fearon, and, laitin, advocate, for, the, greater, integration, of, state, building, in, peacekeeping, efforts, through, a, new, framework, of, neotrusteeship, which, would, see, foreign, powers, exercising, a, great, deal, of, control, over, a, weak, state, s, domestic, affairs, in, order, to, ensure, the, prevention, of, future, violence, a, growing, critique, of, peacekeeping, is, the, lack, of, engagement, between, the, peacekeeping, officials, and, the, local, populace, as, s, verine, autesserre, outlines, in, a, 2015, foreign, policy, article, this, creates, an, environment, where, the, peacekeeping, officials, develop, plans, to, keep, the, peace, but, they, are, disconnected, from, reality, having, the, opposite, effect, on, the, ground, additionally, it, creates, a, reinforcement, mechanism, for, the, peacekeeping, officials, because, the, officials, on, the, ground, report, that, their, plan, was, successfully, implemented, but, in, reality, it, had, adverse, effects, if, the, situation, on, the, ground, turns, into, another, outbreak, of, violence, the, local, populace, will, be, blamed, this, criticism, is, similar, to, the, critic, levelled, at, development, in, developing, countries, by, authors, such, as, james, c, scott, james, ferguson, and, l, lohman, although, peacekeeping, and, development, are, two, different, things, the, logic, behind, the, criticism, is, the, same, the, third, party, officials, whether, they, are, peacekeepers, or, agents, of, development, are, isolated, from, the, general, populace, believing, they, know, what, is, best, and, refusing, to, gather, information, from, a, ground, level, this, is, not, out, of, maliciousness, or, imperialism, but, out, of, a, legitimate, belief, that, they, as, educated, officials, with, access, to, other, experts, and, who, are, well, versed, in, development, and, peacekeeping, literature, know, what, is, best, in, response, to, criticism, particularly, of, the, cases, of, sexual, abuse, by, peacekeepers, the, un, has, taken, steps, toward, reforming, its, operations, the, brahimi, report, was, the, first, of, many, steps, to, recap, former, peacekeeping, missions, isolate, flaws, and, take, steps, to, patch, these, mistakes, to, ensure, the, efficiency, of, future, peacekeeping, missions, the, un, has, vowed, to, continue, to, put, these, practices, into, effect, when, performing, peacekeeping, operations, in, the, future, the, technocratic, aspects, of, the, reform, process, have, been, continued, and, revitalised, by, the, dpko, in, its, peace, operations, 2010, reform, agenda, this, included, an, increase, in, personnel, the, harmonisation, of, the, conditions, of, service, of, field, and, headquarters, staff, the, development, of, guidelines, and, standard, operating, procedures, and, improving, the, partnership, arrangement, between, the, department, of, peacekeeping, operations, dpko, and, the, united, nations, development, programme, undp, african, union, and, european, union, a, 2008, capstone, doctrine, entitled, united, nations, peacekeeping, operations, principles, and, guidelines, incorporates, and, builds, on, the, brahimi, analysis, one, of, the, main, issues, that, the, brahimi, report, identifies, is, the, lack, of, coordination, and, planning, of, the, peacekeeping, operations, also, the, difference, between, the, objectives, of, the, peacekeeping, operations, and, the, resources, destined, to, fund, the, missions, therefore, the, report, asks, the, security, council, to, make, clear, the, goals, and, the, resources, to, accomplish, them, according, to, fearon, and, laitin, the, brahimi, report, provides, a, political, instrument, for, the, secretary, general, to, negotiate, with, the, security, council, the, goals, the, troops, and, the, resources, need, it, to, the, operations, this, instrument, tries, to, avoid, the, cases, of, underfunding, presented, in, missions, such, as, in, bosnia, somalia, and, sierra, leone, christine, gray, analyses, the, issues, of, implementing, the, recommendations, of, the, brahimi, report, she, explains, the, difficulty, in, implementing, these, recommendations, in, particular, in, reducing, the, gap, between, the, mandates, of, security, council, and, the, actual, resources, devoted, to, implementing, them
