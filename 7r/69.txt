hunting, is, the, human, practice, of, seeking, pursuing, capturing, and, killing, wildlife, or, feral, animals, the, most, common, reasons, for, humans, to, hunt, are, to, obtain, the, animal, s, body, for, meat, and, useful, animal, products, fur, hide, bone, tusks, horn, antler, etc, for, recreation, taxidermy, see, trophy, hunting, although, it, may, also, be, done, for, resourceful, reasons, such, as, removing, predators, dangerous, to, humans, or, domestic, animals, e, g, wolf, hunting, to, eliminate, pests, and, nuisance, animals, that, damage, crops, livestock, poultry, or, spread, diseases, see, varminting, for, trade, tourism, see, safari, or, for, ecological, conservation, against, overpopulation, and, invasive, species, commonly, called, a, cull, recreationally, hunted, species, are, generally, referred, to, as, the, game, and, are, usually, mammals, and, birds, a, person, participating, in, a, hunt, is, a, hunter, or, less, commonly, huntsman, a, natural, area, used, for, hunting, is, called, a, game, reserve, and, an, experienced, hunter, who, helps, organise, a, hunt, and, or, manage, the, game, reserve, is, also, known, as, a, gamekeeper, hunting, activities, by, humans, arose, in, homo, erectus, or, earlier, in, the, order, of, millions, of, years, ago, hunting, has, become, deeply, embedded, in, various, human, cultures, and, was, once, an, important, part, of, rural, economies, classified, by, economists, as, part, of, primary, production, alongside, forestry, agriculture, and, fishery, modern, regulations, see, game, law, distinguish, lawful, hunting, activities, from, illegal, poaching, which, involves, the, unauthorised, and, unregulated, killing, trapping, or, capture, of, animals, apart, from, food, provision, hunting, can, be, a, means, of, population, control, hunting, advocates, state, that, regulated, hunting, can, be, a, necessary, component, of, modern, wildlife, management, for, example, to, help, maintain, a, healthy, proportion, of, animal, populations, within, an, environment, s, ecological, carrying, capacity, when, natural, checks, such, as, natural, predators, are, absent, or, insufficient, or, to, provide, funding, for, breeding, programs, and, maintenance, of, natural, reserves, and, conservation, parks, however, excessive, hunting, has, also, heavily, contributed, to, the, endangerment, extirpation, and, extinction, of, many, animals, some, animal, rights, and, anti, hunting, activists, regard, hunting, as, a, cruel, perverse, and, unnecessary, blood, sport, certain, hunting, practices, such, as, canned, hunts, and, ludicrously, paid, bribed, trophy, tours, especially, to, poor, countries, are, considered, unethical, and, exploitative, even, by, some, hunters, marine, mammals, such, as, whales, and, pinnipeds, are, also, targets, of, hunting, both, recreationally, and, commercially, often, with, heated, controversies, regarding, the, morality, ethics, and, legality, of, such, practices, the, pursuit, harvesting, or, catch, and, release, of, fish, and, aquatic, cephalopods, and, crustaceans, is, called, fishing, which, however, is, widely, accepted, and, not, commonly, categorised, as, a, form, of, hunting, it, is, also, not, considered, hunting, to, pursue, animals, without, intent, to, kill, them, as, in, wildlife, photography, birdwatching, or, scientific, research, activities, which, involve, tranquilizing, or, tagging, of, animals, although, green, hunting, is, still, called, so, the, practices, of, netting, or, trapping, insects, and, other, arthropods, for, trophy, collection, or, the, foraging, or, gathering, of, plants, and, mushrooms, are, also, not, regarded, as, hunting, skillful, tracking, and, acquisition, of, an, elusive, target, has, caused, the, word, hunt, to, be, used, in, the, vernacular, as, a, metaphor, for, searching, and, obtaining, something, as, in, treasure, hunting, bargain, hunting, hunting, for, votes, and, even, hunting, down, corruption, and, waste, the, word, hunt, serves, as, both, a, noun, the, act, the, practice, or, an, instance, of, hunting, and, a, verb, to, pursue, for, food, or, in, sport, the, noun, has, been, dated, to, the, early, 12th, century, from, the, verb, hunt, old, english, had, huntung, hunto, the, meaning, of, a, body, of, persons, associated, for, the, purpose, of, hunting, with, a, pack, of, hounds, is, first, recorded, in, the, 1570s, the, act, of, searching, for, someone, or, something, is, from, about, 1600, the, verb, old, english, huntian, to, chase, game, transitive, and, intransitive, perhaps, developed, from, hunta, hunter, is, related, to, hentan, to, seize, from, proto, germanic, huntojan, the, source, also, of, gothic, hin, an, to, seize, capture, old, high, german, hunda, booty, which, is, of, uncertain, origin, the, general, sense, of, search, diligently, for, anything, is, first, recorded, c, 1200, hunting, has, a, long, history, it, predates, the, emergence, of, homo, sapiens, anatomically, modern, humans, and, may, even, predate, the, genus, homo, the, oldest, undisputed, evidence, for, hunting, dates, to, the, early, pleistocene, consistent, with, the, emergence, and, early, dispersal, of, homo, erectus, about, 1, 7, million, years, ago, acheulean, while, it, is, undisputed, that, homo, erectus, were, hunters, the, importance, of, this, for, the, emergence, of, homo, erectus, from, its, australopithecine, ancestors, including, the, production, of, stone, tools, and, eventually, the, control, of, fire, is, emphasised, in, the, so, called, hunting, hypothesis, and, de, emphasised, in, scenarios, that, stress, omnivory, and, social, interaction, there, is, no, direct, evidence, for, hunting, predating, homo, erectus, in, either, homo, habilis, or, in, australopithecus, the, early, hominid, ancestors, of, humans, were, probably, frugivores, or, omnivores, with, a, partially, carnivorous, diet, from, scavenging, rather, than, hunting, evidence, for, australopithecine, meat, consumption, was, presented, in, the, 1990s, it, has, nevertheless, often, been, assumed, that, at, least, occasional, hunting, behaviour, may, have, been, present, well, before, the, emergence, of, homo, this, can, be, argued, on, the, basis, of, comparison, with, chimpanzees, the, closest, extant, relatives, of, humans, who, also, engage, in, hunting, indicating, that, the, behavioural, trait, may, have, been, present, in, the, chimpanzee, human, last, common, ancestor, as, early, as, 5, million, years, ago, the, common, chimpanzee, pan, troglodytes, regularly, engages, in, troop, predation, behaviour, where, bands, of, beta, males, are, led, by, an, alpha, male, bonobos, pan, paniscus, have, also, been, observed, to, occasionally, engage, in, group, hunting, although, more, rarely, than, pan, troglodytes, mainly, subsisting, on, a, frugivorous, diet, indirect, evidence, for, oldowan, era, hunting, by, early, homo, or, late, australopithecus, has, been, presented, in, a, 2009, study, based, on, an, oldowan, site, in, southwestern, kenya, louis, binford, 1986, criticised, the, idea, that, early, hominids, and, early, humans, were, hunters, on, the, basis, of, the, analysis, of, the, skeletal, remains, of, the, consumed, animals, he, concluded, that, hominids, and, early, humans, were, mostly, scavengers, not, hunters, blumenschine, 1986, proposed, the, idea, of, confrontational, scavenging, which, involves, challenging, and, scaring, off, other, predators, after, they, have, made, a, kill, which, he, suggests, could, have, been, the, leading, method, of, obtaining, protein, rich, meat, by, early, humans, stone, spearheads, dated, as, early, as, 500, 000, years, ago, were, found, in, south, africa, wood, does, not, preserve, well, however, and, craig, stanford, a, primatologist, and, professor, of, anthropology, at, the, university, of, southern, california, has, suggested, that, the, discovery, of, spear, use, by, chimpanzees, probably, means, that, early, humans, used, wooden, spears, as, well, perhaps, five, million, years, ago, the, earliest, dated, find, of, surviving, wooden, hunting, spears, dates, to, the, very, end, of, the, lower, paleolithic, just, before, 300, 000, years, ago, the, sch, ningen, spears, found, in, 1976, in, germany, are, associated, with, homo, heidelbergensis, the, hunting, hypothesis, sees, the, emergence, of, behavioral, modernity, in, the, middle, paleolithic, as, directly, related, to, hunting, including, mating, behaviour, the, establishment, of, language, culture, and, religion, mythology, and, animal, sacrifice, sociologist, david, nibert, of, wittenberg, university, argues, that, the, emergence, of, the, organized, hunting, of, animals, undermined, the, communal, egalitarian, nature, of, early, human, societies, with, the, status, of, women, and, less, powerful, males, declining, as, the, status, of, men, quickly, became, associated, with, their, success, at, hunting, which, also, increased, human, violence, within, these, societies, however, 9000, year, old, remains, of, a, female, hunter, along, with, a, toolkit, of, projectile, points, and, animal, processing, implements, were, discovered, at, the, andean, site, of, wilamaya, patjxa, puno, district, in, peru, evidence, exists, that, hunting, may, have, been, one, of, the, multiple, or, possibly, main, environmental, factors, leading, to, the, holocene, extinction, of, megafauna, and, their, replacement, by, smaller, herbivores, in, some, locations, such, as, australia, humans, are, thought, to, have, played, a, very, significant, role, in, the, extinction, of, the, australian, megafauna, that, was, widespread, prior, to, human, occupation, hunting, was, a, crucial, component, of, hunter, gatherer, societies, before, the, domestication, of, livestock, and, the, dawn, of, agriculture, beginning, about, 11, 000, years, ago, in, some, parts, of, the, world, in, addition, to, the, spear, hunting, weapons, developed, during, the, upper, paleolithic, include, the, atlatl, a, spear, thrower, before, 30, 000, years, ago, and, the, bow, 18, 000, years, ago, by, the, mesolithic, hunting, strategies, had, diversified, with, the, development, of, these, more, far, reaching, weapons, and, the, domestication, of, the, dog, about, 15, 000, years, ago, evidence, puts, the, earliest, known, mammoth, hunting, in, asia, with, spears, to, approximately, 16, 200, years, ago, many, species, of, animals, have, been, hunted, throughout, history, one, theory, is, that, in, north, america, and, eurasia, caribou, and, wild, reindeer, may, well, be, the, species, of, single, greatest, importance, in, the, entire, anthropological, literature, on, hunting, see, also, reindeer, age, although, the, varying, importance, of, different, species, depended, on, the, geographic, location, mesolithic, hunter, gathering, lifestyles, remained, prevalent, in, some, parts, of, the, americas, sub, saharan, africa, and, siberia, as, well, as, all, of, australia, until, the, european, age, of, discovery, they, still, persist, in, some, tribal, societies, albeit, in, rapid, decline, peoples, that, preserved, paleolithic, hunting, gathering, until, the, recent, past, include, some, indigenous, peoples, of, the, amazonas, ach, some, central, and, southern, african, san, people, some, peoples, of, new, guinea, fayu, the, mlabri, of, thailand, and, laos, the, vedda, people, of, sri, lanka, and, a, handful, of, uncontacted, peoples, in, africa, one, of, the, last, remaining, hunter, gatherer, tribes, are, the, hadza, of, tanzania, even, as, animal, domestication, became, relatively, widespread, and, after, the, development, of, agriculture, hunting, usually, remained, a, significant, contributor, to, the, human, food, supply, the, supplementary, meat, and, materials, from, hunting, included, protein, bone, for, implements, sinew, for, cordage, fur, feathers, rawhide, and, leather, used, in, clothing, hunting, is, still, vital, in, marginal, climates, especially, those, unsuited, for, pastoral, uses, or, for, agriculture, for, example, inuit, in, the, arctic, trap, and, hunt, animals, for, clothing, and, use, the, skins, of, sea, mammals, to, make, kayaks, clothing, and, footwear, on, ancient, reliefs, especially, from, mesopotamia, kings, are, often, depicted, by, sculptors, as, hunters, of, big, game, such, as, lions, and, are, often, portrayed, hunting, from, a, war, chariot, early, examples, of, royalty, symbolically, and, militaristically, engaging, in, hunting, as, the, sport, of, kings, the, cultural, and, psychological, importance, of, hunting, in, ancient, societies, is, represented, by, deities, such, as, the, horned, god, cernunnos, and, lunar, goddesses, of, classical, antiquity, the, greek, artemis, or, roman, diana, taboos, are, often, related, to, hunting, and, mythological, association, of, prey, species, with, a, divinity, could, be, reflected, in, hunting, restrictions, such, as, a, reserve, surrounding, a, temple, euripides, tale, of, artemis, and, actaeon, for, example, may, be, seen, as, a, caution, against, disrespect, of, prey, or, against, impudent, boasting, with, the, domestication, of, the, dog, birds, of, prey, and, the, ferret, various, forms, of, animal, aided, hunting, developed, including, venery, scent, hound, hunting, such, as, fox, hunting, coursing, sight, hound, hunting, falconry, and, ferreting, while, these, are, all, associated, with, medieval, hunting, over, time, various, dog, breeds, were, selected, by, humans, for, very, precise, tasks, during, the, hunt, reflected, in, such, names, as, pointer, and, setter, even, as, agriculture, and, animal, husbandry, became, more, prevalent, hunting, often, remained, as, a, part, of, human, culture, where, the, environment, and, social, conditions, allowed, hunter, gatherer, societies, persisted, even, when, increasingly, confined, to, marginal, areas, and, within, agricultural, systems, hunting, served, to, kill, animals, that, prey, upon, domestic, and, wild, animals, or, to, attempt, to, extirpate, animals, seen, by, humans, as, competition, for, resources, such, as, water, or, forage, when, hunting, moved, from, a, subsistence, activity, to, a, selective, one, two, trends, emerged, the, meaning, of, the, word, game, in, middle, english, evolved, to, include, an, animal, which, is, hunted, as, the, domestication, of, animals, for, meat, grew, subsistence, hunting, remained, among, the, lowest, classes, however, the, stylised, pursuit, of, game, in, european, societies, became, a, luxury, dangerous, hunting, such, as, for, lions, or, wild, boars, often, done, on, horseback, or, from, a, chariot, had, a, function, similar, to, tournaments, and, manly, sports, hunting, ranked, as, an, honourable, somewhat, competitive, pastime, to, help, the, aristocracy, practice, skills, of, war, in, times, of, peace, in, most, parts, of, medieval, europe, the, upper, class, obtained, the, sole, rights, to, hunt, in, certain, areas, of, a, feudal, territory, game, in, these, areas, was, used, as, a, source, of, food, and, furs, often, provided, via, professional, huntsmen, but, it, was, also, expected, to, provide, a, form, of, recreation, for, the, aristocracy, the, importance, of, this, proprietary, view, of, game, can, be, seen, in, the, robin, hood, legends, in, which, one, of, the, primary, charges, against, the, outlaws, is, that, they, hunt, the, king, s, deer, in, contrast, settlers, in, anglophone, colonies, gloried, democratically, in, hunting, for, all, in, medieval, europe, hunting, was, considered, by, johannes, scotus, eriugena, to, be, part, of, the, set, of, seven, mechanical, arts, although, various, other, animals, have, been, used, to, aid, the, hunter, such, as, ferrets, the, dog, has, assumed, many, very, important, uses, to, the, hunter, the, domestication, of, the, dog, has, led, to, a, symbiotic, relationship, in, which, the, dog, s, independence, from, humans, is, deferred, though, dogs, can, survive, independently, of, humans, and, in, many, cases, do, ferally, when, raised, or, adopted, by, humans, the, species, tends, to, defer, to, its, control, in, exchange, for, habitation, food, and, support, dogs, today, are, used, to, find, chase, retrieve, and, sometimes, kill, game, dogs, allow, humans, to, pursue, and, kill, prey, that, would, otherwise, be, very, difficult, or, dangerous, to, hunt, different, breeds, of, specifically, bred, hunting, dog, are, used, for, different, types, of, hunting, waterfowl, are, commonly, hunted, using, retrieving, dogs, such, as, the, labrador, retriever, the, golden, retriever, the, chesapeake, bay, retriever, the, brittany, spaniel, and, other, similar, breeds, game, birds, are, flushed, out, using, flushing, spaniels, such, as, the, english, springer, spaniel, the, various, cocker, spaniels, and, similar, breeds, the, hunting, of, wild, mammals, in, england, and, wales, with, dogs, was, banned, under, the, hunting, act, 2004, the, wild, mammals, include, fox, hare, deer, and, mink, there, are, however, exceptions, in, the, act, nevertheless, there, have, been, numerous, attempts, on, behalf, of, activists, pressure, groups, etc, to, revoke, the, act, over, the, last, two, decades, many, prehistoric, deities, are, depicted, as, predators, or, prey, of, humans, often, in, a, zoomorphic, form, perhaps, alluding, to, the, importance, of, hunting, for, most, palaeolithic, cultures, in, many, pagan, religions, specific, rituals, are, conducted, before, or, after, a, hunt, the, rituals, done, may, vary, according, to, the, species, hunted, or, the, season, the, hunt, is, taking, place, often, a, hunting, ground, or, the, hunt, for, one, or, more, species, was, reserved, or, prohibited, in, the, context, of, a, temple, cult, in, roman, religion, diana, is, the, goddess, of, the, hunt, hindu, scriptures, describe, hunting, as, an, occupation, as, well, as, a, sport, of, the, kingly, even, figures, considered, divine, are, described, to, have, engaged, in, hunting, one, of, the, names, of, the, god, shiva, is, mrigavyadha, deer, slayer, the, word, mriga, in, many, indian, languages, including, malayalam, not, only, stands, for, deer, but, for, all, animals, and, animal, instincts, mriga, thrishna, shiva, as, mrigavyadha, is, the, one, who, destroys, the, animal, instincts, in, human, beings, in, the, epic, ramayana, dasharatha, the, father, of, rama, is, said, to, have, the, ability, to, hunt, in, the, dark, during, one, of, his, hunting, expeditions, he, accidentally, killed, shravana, mistaking, him, for, game, during, rama, s, exile, in, the, forest, ravana, kidnapped, his, wife, sita, from, their, hut, while, rama, was, asked, by, sita, to, capture, a, golden, deer, and, his, brother, lakshman, went, after, him, according, to, the, mahabharat, pandu, the, father, of, the, pandavas, accidentally, killed, the, sage, kindama, and, his, wife, with, an, arrow, mistaking, them, for, a, deer, jainism, teaches, followers, to, have, tremendous, respect, for, all, of, life, prohibitions, for, hunting, and, meat, eating, are, the, fundamental, conditions, for, being, a, jain, buddhism, s, first, precept, is, the, respect, for, all, sentient, life, the, general, approach, by, all, buddhists, is, to, avoid, killing, any, living, animals, buddha, explained, the, issue, by, saying, all, fear, death, comparing, others, with, oneself, one, should, neither, kill, nor, cause, to, kill, in, sikhism, only, meat, obtained, from, hunting, or, slaughtered, with, the, jhatka, is, permitted, the, sikh, gurus, especially, guru, hargobind, and, guru, gobind, singh, were, ardent, hunters, many, old, sikh, rehatnamas, like, prem, sumarag, recommend, hunting, wild, boar, and, deer, however, among, modern, sikhs, the, practice, of, hunting, has, died, down, some, even, saying, that, all, meat, is, forbidden, from, early, christian, times, hunting, has, been, forbidden, to, roman, catholic, church, clerics, thus, the, corpus, juris, canonici, c, ii, x, de, cleric, venat, says, we, forbid, to, all, servants, of, god, hunting, and, expeditions, through, the, woods, with, hounds, and, we, also, forbid, them, to, keep, hawks, or, falcons, the, fourth, council, of, the, lateran, held, under, pope, innocent, iii, decreed, canon, xv, we, interdict, hunting, or, hawking, to, all, clerics, the, decree, of, the, council, of, trent, is, worded, more, mildly, let, clerics, abstain, from, illicit, hunting, and, hawking, sess, xxiv, de, reform, c, xii, which, seems, to, imply, that, not, all, hunting, is, illicit, and, canonists, generally, make, a, distinction, declaring, noisy, clamorosa, hunting, unlawful, but, not, quiet, quieta, hunting, ferraris, gives, it, as, the, general, sense, of, canonists, that, hunting, is, allowed, to, clerics, if, it, be, indulged, in, rarely, and, for, sufficient, cause, as, necessity, utility, or, honest, recreation, and, with, that, moderation, which, is, becoming, to, the, ecclesiastical, state, ziegler, however, thinks, that, the, interpretation, of, the, canonists, is, not, in, accordance, with, the, letter, or, spirit, of, the, laws, of, the, church, nevertheless, although, a, distinction, between, lawful, and, unlawful, hunting, is, undoubtedly, permissible, it, is, certain, that, a, bishop, can, absolutely, prohibit, all, hunting, to, the, clerics, of, his, diocese, as, was, done, by, synods, at, milan, avignon, li, ge, cologne, and, elsewhere, benedict, xiv, declared, that, such, synodal, decrees, are, not, too, severe, as, an, absolute, prohibition, of, hunting, is, more, conformable, to, the, ecclesiastical, law, in, practice, therefore, the, synodal, statutes, of, various, localities, must, be, consulted, to, discover, whether, they, allow, quiet, hunting, or, prohibit, it, altogether, small, scale, hunting, as, a, family, or, subsistence, farming, activity, is, recognised, by, pope, francis, in, his, encyclical, letter, laudato, si, as, a, legitimate, and, valuable, aspect, of, employment, within, the, food, production, system, hunting, is, not, forbidden, in, jewish, law, although, there, is, an, aversion, to, it, the, great, 18th, century, authority, rabbi, yechezkel, landau, after, a, study, concluded, although, hunting, would, not, be, considered, cruelty, to, animals, insofar, as, the, animal, is, generally, killed, quickly, and, not, tortured, there, is, an, unseemly, element, in, it, namely, cruelty, the, other, issue, is, that, hunting, can, be, dangerous, and, judaism, places, an, extreme, emphasis, on, the, value, of, human, life, islamic, sharia, law, permits, hunting, of, lawful, animals, and, birds, if, they, cannot, be, easily, caught, and, slaughtered, however, this, is, only, for, the, purpose, of, food, and, not, for, trophy, hunting, a, safari, from, a, swahili, word, meaning, journey, expedition, especially, in, africa, is, defined, as, a, journey, to, see, or, kill, animals, in, their, natural, environment, most, commonly, in, east, africa, safari, as, a, distinctive, way, of, hunting, was, popularized, by, the, us, author, ernest, hemingway, and, president, theodore, roosevelt, a, safari, may, consist, of, a, several, days, or, even, weeks, long, journey, with, camping, in, the, bush, or, jungle, while, pursuing, big, game, nowadays, it, is, often, used, to, describe, hunting, tours, through, african, wildlife, hunters, are, usually, tourists, accompanied, by, licensed, and, highly, regulated, professional, hunters, local, guides, skinners, and, porters, in, more, difficult, terrains, a, special, safari, type, is, the, solo, safari, where, all, the, license, acquiring, stalking, preparation, and, outfitting, is, done, by, the, hunter, himself, during, the, feudal, and, colonial, times, in, british, india, hunting, or, shikar, was, regarded, as, a, regal, sport, in, the, numerous, princely, states, as, many, maharajas, and, nawabs, as, well, as, british, officers, maintained, a, whole, corps, of, shikari, s, big, game, hunters, who, were, native, professional, hunters, they, would, be, headed, by, a, master, of, the, hunt, who, might, be, styled, mir, shikar, often, they, recruited, the, normally, low, ranking, local, tribes, because, of, their, traditional, knowledge, of, the, environment, and, hunting, techniques, big, game, such, as, bengal, tigers, might, be, hunted, from, the, back, of, an, indian, elephant, regional, social, norms, are, generally, antagonistic, to, hunting, while, a, few, sects, such, as, the, bishnoi, lay, special, emphasis, on, the, conservation, of, particular, species, such, as, the, antelope, india, s, wildlife, protection, act, of, 1972, bans, the, killing, of, all, wild, animals, however, the, chief, wildlife, warden, may, if, satisfied, that, any, wild, animal, from, a, specified, list, has, become, dangerous, to, human, life, or, is, so, disabled, or, diseased, as, to, be, beyond, recovery, permit, any, person, to, hunt, such, an, animal, in, this, case, the, body, of, any, wild, animal, killed, or, wounded, becomes, government, property, the, practice, among, the, soldiers, in, british, india, during, the, 1770s, of, going, out, to, hunt, snipes, a, shorebird, considered, extremely, challenging, for, hunters, due, to, its, alertness, camouflaging, colour, and, erratic, flight, behavior, is, believed, to, be, the, origin, of, the, modern, word, for, sniper, as, snipe, hunters, needed, to, be, stealthy, in, addition, to, having, tracking, skills, and, marksmanship, the, term, was, used, in, the, nineteenth, century, and, had, become, common, usage, by, the, first, world, war, unarmed, fox, hunting, on, horseback, with, hounds, is, the, type, of, hunting, most, closely, associated, with, the, united, kingdom, in, fact, hunting, without, qualification, implies, fox, hunting, what, in, other, countries, is, called, hunting, is, called, shooting, birds, or, stalking, deer, in, britain, fox, hunting, is, a, social, activity, for, the, upper, classes, with, roles, strictly, defined, by, wealth, and, status, similar, to, fox, hunting, in, many, ways, is, the, chasing, of, hares, with, hounds, pairs, of, sighthounds, or, long, dogs, such, as, greyhounds, may, be, used, to, pursue, a, hare, in, coursing, where, the, greyhounds, are, marked, as, to, their, skill, in, coursing, the, hare, but, are, not, intended, to, actually, catch, it, or, the, hare, may, be, pursued, with, scent, hounds, such, as, beagles, or, harriers, other, sorts, of, foxhounds, may, also, be, used, for, hunting, stags, deer, or, mink, deer, stalking, with, rifles, is, carried, out, on, foot, without, hounds, using, stealth, these, forms, of, hunting, have, been, controversial, in, the, uk, animal, welfare, supporters, believe, that, hunting, causes, unnecessary, suffering, to, foxes, horses, and, hounds, proponents, argue, that, the, activity, is, a, historical, tradition, using, dogs, to, chase, wild, mammals, was, made, illegal, in, february, 2005, by, the, hunting, act, 2004, there, were, a, number, of, exemptions, under, which, the, activity, may, not, be, illegal, in, the, act, for, hunting, with, hounds, but, no, exemptions, at, all, for, hare, coursing, game, birds, especially, pheasants, are, shot, with, shotguns, for, sport, in, the, uk, the, british, association, for, shooting, and, conservation, says, that, over, a, million, people, per, year, participate, in, shooting, including, game, shooting, clay, pigeon, shooting, and, target, shooting, shooting, as, practiced, in, britain, as, opposed, to, traditional, hunting, requires, little, questing, for, game, around, thirty, five, million, birds, are, released, onto, shooting, estates, every, year, some, having, been, factory, farmed, shoots, can, be, elaborate, affairs, with, guns, placed, in, assigned, positions, and, assistants, to, help, load, shotguns, when, in, position, beaters, move, through, the, areas, of, cover, swinging, sticks, or, flags, to, drive, the, game, out, such, events, are, often, called, drives, the, open, season, for, grouse, in, the, uk, begins, on, 12, august, the, so, called, glorious, twelfth, the, definition, of, game, in, the, united, kingdom, is, governed, by, the, game, act, 1831, 1, 2, will, 4, c, 32, a, similar, tradition, ojeo, exists, in, spain, north, american, hunting, pre, dates, the, united, states, by, thousands, of, years, and, was, an, important, part, of, many, pre, columbian, native, american, cultures, native, americans, retain, some, hunting, rights, and, are, exempt, from, some, laws, as, part, of, indian, treaties, and, otherwise, under, federal, law, examples, include, eagle, feather, laws, and, exemptions, in, the, marine, mammal, protection, act, this, is, considered, particularly, important, in, alaskan, native, communities, gun, usage, in, hunting, is, typically, regulated, by, game, category, area, within, the, state, and, time, period, regulations, for, big, game, hunting, often, specify, a, minimum, caliber, or, muzzle, energy, for, firearms, the, use, of, rifles, is, often, banned, for, safety, reasons, in, areas, with, high, population, densities, or, limited, topographic, relief, regulations, may, also, limit, or, ban, the, use, of, lead, in, ammunition, because, of, environmental, concerns, specific, seasons, for, bow, hunting, or, muzzle, loading, black, powder, guns, are, often, established, to, limit, competition, with, hunters, using, more, effective, weapons, hunting, in, the, united, states, is, not, associated, with, any, particular, class, or, culture, a, 2006, poll, showed, seventy, eight, per, cent, of, americans, supported, legal, hunting, although, relatively, few, americans, actually, hunt, at, the, beginning, of, the, 21st, century, just, six, per, cent, of, americans, hunted, southerners, in, states, along, the, eastern, seaboard, hunted, at, a, rate, of, five, per, cent, slightly, below, the, national, average, and, while, hunting, was, more, common, in, other, parts, of, the, south, at, nine, per, cent, these, rates, did, not, surpass, those, of, the, plains, states, where, twelve, per, cent, of, midwesterners, hunted, hunting, in, other, areas, of, the, country, fell, below, the, national, average, overall, in, the, 1996, 2006, period, the, number, of, hunters, over, the, age, of, sixteen, declined, by, ten, per, cent, a, drop, attributable, to, a, number, of, factors, including, habitat, loss, and, changes, in, recreation, habits, the, principles, of, the, fair, chase, have, been, a, part, of, the, american, hunting, tradition, for, over, one, hundred, years, the, role, of, the, hunter, conservationist, popularised, by, theodore, roosevelt, and, perpetuated, by, roosevelt, s, formation, of, the, boone, and, crockett, club, has, been, central, to, the, development, of, the, modern, fair, chase, tradition, beyond, fair, chase, the, ethic, and, tradition, of, hunting, a, book, by, jim, posewitz, describes, fair, chase, fundamental, to, ethical, hunting, is, the, idea, of, fair, chase, this, concept, addresses, the, balance, between, the, hunter, and, the, hunted, it, is, a, balance, that, allows, hunters, to, occasionally, succeed, while, animals, generally, avoid, being, taken, when, internet, hunting, was, introduced, in, 2005, allowing, people, to, hunt, over, the, internet, using, remotely, controlled, guns, the, practice, was, widely, criticised, by, hunters, as, violating, the, principles, of, fair, chase, as, a, representative, of, the, national, rifle, association, of, america, nra, explained, the, nra, has, always, maintained, that, fair, chase, being, in, the, field, with, your, firearm, or, bow, is, an, important, element, of, hunting, tradition, sitting, at, your, desk, in, front, of, your, computer, clicking, at, a, mouse, has, nothing, to, do, with, hunting, animals, such, as, blackbuck, nilgai, axis, deer, fallow, deer, zebras, barasingha, gazelle, and, many, other, exotic, game, species, can, now, be, found, on, game, farms, and, ranches, in, texas, where, they, were, introduced, for, sport, hunting, these, hunters, can, be, found, paying, in, excess, of, 10, 000, to, take, trophy, animals, on, these, controlled, ranches, the, russian, imperial, hunts, evolved, from, hunting, traditions, of, early, russian, rulers, grand, princes, and, tsars, under, the, influence, of, hunting, customs, of, european, royal, courts, the, imperial, hunts, were, organised, mainly, in, peterhof, tsarskoye, selo, and, gatchina, hunting, in, australia, has, evolved, around, the, hunting, and, eradication, of, various, animals, considered, to, be, pests, or, invasive, species, all, native, animals, are, protected, by, law, and, certain, species, such, as, kangaroos, and, ducks, can, be, hunted, by, licensed, shooters, but, only, under, a, special, permit, on, public, lands, during, open, seasons, the, introduced, species, that, are, targeted, include, european, rabbits, red, foxes, deer, sambar, hog, red, fallow, chital, and, rusa, feral, cats, pigs, goats, brumbies, donkeys, and, occasionally, camels, as, well, as, introduced, upland, birds, such, as, quails, pheasants, and, partridges, new, zealand, has, a, strong, hunting, culture, when, humans, arrived, the, only, mammals, present, on, the, islands, making, up, new, zealand, were, bats, although, seals, and, other, marine, mammals, were, present, along, the, coasts, however, when, humans, arrived, they, brought, other, species, with, them, polynesian, voyagers, introduced, kuri, dogs, kiore, polynesian, rats, as, well, as, a, range, of, plant, species, european, explorers, further, added, to, new, zealand, s, biota, particularly, pigs, which, were, introduced, by, either, captain, cook, or, the, french, explorer, de, surville, in, the, 1700s, during, the, nineteenth, century, as, european, colonisation, took, place, acclimatisation, societies, were, established, the, societies, introduced, a, large, number, of, species, with, no, use, other, than, as, prey, for, hunting, species, that, adapted, well, to, the, new, zealand, terrain, include, deer, pigs, goats, hare, tahr, and, chamois, with, wilderness, areas, suitable, forage, and, no, natural, predators, their, populations, exploded, government, agencies, view, the, animals, as, pests, due, to, their, effects, on, the, natural, environment, and, on, agricultural, production, but, hunters, view, them, as, a, resource, iranian, tradition, regarded, hunting, as, an, essential, part, of, a, prince, s, education, and, hunting, was, well, recorded, for, the, education, of, the, upper, class, youths, during, pre, islamic, persia, as, of, october, 2020, a, hunting, licensee, costs, 20, 000, the, department, of, environment, although, do, not, report, the, number, of, permits, issued, the, numbers, of, licensed, hunters, in, japan, including, those, using, snares, and, guns, is, generally, decreasing, while, their, average, age, is, increasing, as, of, 2010, there, were, approximately, 190, 000, registered, hunters, approximately, 65, of, whom, were, sixty, years, old, or, older, there, is, a, very, active, tradition, of, hunting, small, to, medium, sized, wild, game, in, trinidad, and, tobago, hunting, is, carried, out, with, firearms, slingshots, and, cage, traps, and, sometimes, aided, by, the, use, of, hounds, the, illegal, use, of, trap, guns, and, snare, nets, also, occurs, with, approximately, 12, 000, to, 13, 000, hunters, applying, for, and, being, granted, hunting, permits, in, recent, years, there, is, some, concern, that, the, practice, might, not, be, sustainable, in, addition, there, are, at, present, no, bag, limits, and, the, open, season, is, comparatively, very, long, 5, months, october, to, february, inclusive, as, such, hunting, pressure, from, legal, hunters, is, very, high, added, to, that, there, is, a, thriving, and, very, lucrative, black, market, for, poached, wild, game, sold, and, enthusiastically, purchased, as, expensive, luxury, delicacies, and, the, numbers, of, commercial, poachers, in, operation, is, unknown, but, presumed, to, be, fairly, high, as, a, result, the, populations, of, the, five, major, mammalian, game, species, red, rumped, agouti, lowland, paca, nine, banded, armadillo, collared, peccary, and, red, brocket, deer, are, thought, to, be, relatively, low, when, compared, to, less, hunted, regions, in, nearby, mainland, south, america, although, scientifically, conducted, population, studies, are, only, just, recently, being, conducted, as, of, 2013, it, appears, that, the, red, brocket, deer, population, has, been, extirpated, in, tobago, as, a, result, of, over, hunting, by, some, time, in, the, mid, 20th, century, another, extirpation, due, to, over, hunting, occurred, in, trinidad, with, its, population, of, horned, screamer, a, large, game, bird, various, herons, ducks, doves, the, green, iguana, the, cryptic, golden, tegu, the, spectacled, caiman, the, common, opossum, and, the, capybara, are, also, commonly, hunted, and, poached, there, is, also, some, poaching, of, fully, protected, species, including, red, howler, monkey, and, capuchin, monkeys, southern, tamandua, brazilian, porcupine, yellow, footed, tortoise, the, critically, endangered, island, endemic, trinidad, piping, guan, and, even, one, of, the, national, birds, the, scarlet, ibis, legal, hunters, pay, relatively, small, fees, to, obtain, hunting, licenses, and, undergo, no, official, basic, conservation, biology, or, hunting, ethics, fair, chase, training, and, are, not, assessed, regarding, their, knowledge, and, comprehension, of, the, local, wildlife, conservation, laws, there, is, presumed, to, be, relatively, little, subsistence, hunting, in, the, country, with, most, hunting, for, either, sport, or, commercial, profit, the, local, wildlife, management, authorities, are, under, staffed, and, under, funded, and, as, such, little, in, the, way, of, enforcement, is, done, to, uphold, existing, wildlife, management, laws, with, hunting, poaching, occurring, both, in, and, out, of, season, and, even, in, wildlife, sanctuaries, there, is, some, indication, that, the, government, is, beginning, to, take, the, issue, of, wildlife, management, more, seriously, with, well, drafted, legislation, being, brought, before, parliament, in, 2015, it, remains, to, be, seen, if, the, drafted, legislation, will, be, fully, adopted, and, financially, supported, by, the, current, and, future, governments, and, if, the, general, populace, will, move, towards, a, greater, awareness, of, the, importance, of, wildlife, conservation, and, change, the, culture, of, wanton, consumption, to, one, of, sustainable, management, hunting, is, claimed, to, give, resource, managers, an, important, tool, in, managing, populations, that, might, exceed, the, carrying, capacity, of, their, habitat, and, threaten, the, well, being, of, other, species, or, in, some, instances, damage, human, health, or, safety, in, some, cases, hunting, actually, can, increase, the, population, of, predators, such, as, coyotes, by, removing, territorial, bounds, that, would, otherwise, be, established, resulting, in, excess, neighbouring, migrations, into, an, area, thus, artificially, increasing, the, population, hunting, advocates, assert, that, hunting, reduces, intraspecific, competition, for, food, and, shelter, reducing, mortality, among, the, remaining, animals, some, environmentalists, assert, that, re, introducing, predators, would, achieve, the, same, end, with, greater, efficiency, and, less, negative, effect, such, as, introducing, significant, amounts, of, free, lead, into, the, environment, and, food, chain, in, the, united, states, wildlife, managers, are, frequently, part, of, hunting, regulatory, and, licensing, bodies, where, they, help, to, set, rules, on, the, number, manner, and, conditions, in, which, game, may, be, hunted, management, agencies, sometimes, rely, on, hunting, to, control, specific, animal, populations, as, has, been, the, case, with, deer, in, north, america, these, hunts, may, sometimes, be, carried, out, by, professional, shooters, although, others, may, include, amateur, hunters, many, us, city, and, local, governments, hire, professional, and, amateur, hunters, each, year, to, reduce, populations, of, animals, such, as, deer, that, are, becoming, hazardous, in, a, restricted, area, such, as, neighbourhood, parks, and, metropolitan, open, spaces, a, large, part, of, managing, populations, involves, managing, the, number, and, sometimes, the, size, or, age, of, animals, harvested, so, as, to, ensure, the, sustainability, of, the, population, tools, that, are, frequently, used, to, control, harvest, are, bag, limits, and, season, closures, although, gear, restrictions, such, as, archery, only, seasons, are, becoming, increasingly, popular, in, an, effort, to, reduce, hunter, success, rates, in, countries, that, rely, on, bag, limits, per, hunter, instead, of, per, area, illegal, hunting, and, harvesting, of, wild, species, contrary, to, local, and, international, conservation, and, wildlife, management, laws, is, called, poaching, game, preservation, is, one, of, the, tactics, used, to, prevent, poaching, violations, of, hunting, laws, and, regulations, involving, poaching, are, normally, punishable, by, law, punishment, can, include, confiscation, of, equipment, fines, or, a, prison, sentence, the, right, to, hunt, sometimes, in, combination, with, the, right, to, fish, is, protected, implicitly, as, a, consequence, of, the, right, of, ownership, or, explicitly, as, a, right, on, its, own, in, a, number, of, jurisdictions, for, instance, as, of, 2019, a, total, of, 22, u, s, states, explicitly, recognize, a, subjective, right, to, hunt, in, their, constitutions, bag, limits, are, provisions, under, the, law, that, control, how, many, animals, of, a, given, species, or, group, of, species, can, be, killed, although, there, are, often, species, for, which, bag, limits, do, not, apply, there, are, also, jurisdictions, where, bag, limits, are, not, applied, at, all, or, are, not, applied, under, certain, circumstances, the, phrase, bag, limits, come, from, the, custom, among, hunters, of, small, game, to, carry, successful, kills, in, a, small, basket, similar, to, a, fishing, creel, where, bag, limits, are, used, there, can, be, daily, or, seasonal, bag, limits, for, example, ducks, can, often, be, harvested, at, a, rate, of, six, per, hunter, per, day, big, game, like, moose, most, often, have, a, seasonal, bag, limit, of, one, animal, per, hunter, bag, limits, may, also, regulate, the, size, sex, or, age, of, animal, that, a, hunter, can, kill, in, many, cases, bag, limits, are, designed, to, allocate, harvest, among, the, hunting, population, more, equitably, rather, than, to, protect, animal, populations, as, protecting, the, population, would, necessitate, regional, density, dependent, maximum, bags, a, closed, season, is, a, time, during, which, hunting, an, animal, of, a, given, species, is, contrary, to, law, typically, closed, seasons, are, designed, to, protect, a, species, when, they, are, most, vulnerable, or, to, protect, them, during, their, breeding, season, by, extension, the, period, that, is, not, the, closed, season, is, known, as, the, open, season, historical, subsistence, and, sport, hunting, techniques, can, differ, radically, with, modern, hunting, regulations, often, addressing, issues, of, where, when, and, how, hunts, are, conducted, techniques, may, vary, depending, on, government, regulations, a, hunter, s, personal, ethics, local, custom, hunting, equipment, and, the, animal, being, hunted, often, a, hunter, will, use, a, combination, of, more, than, one, technique, laws, may, forbid, sport, hunters, from, using, some, methods, used, primarily, in, poaching, and, wildlife, management, millions, the, total, population, hunters, inhabitants, trophy, hunting, is, the, selective, seeking, and, killing, of, wild, game, animals, to, take, trophies, for, personal, collection, bragging, rights, or, as, a, status, symbol, it, may, also, include, the, controversial, hunting, of, captive, or, semi, captive, animals, expressly, bred, and, raised, under, controlled, or, semi, controlled, conditions, so, as, to, attain, trophy, characteristics, this, is, sometimes, known, as, canned, hunts, in, the, 19th, century, southern, and, central, european, sport, hunters, often, pursued, game, only, for, a, trophy, usually, the, head, or, pelt, of, an, animal, which, was, then, displayed, as, a, sign, of, prowess, the, rest, of, the, animal, was, typically, discarded, some, cultures, however, disapprove, of, such, waste, in, nordic, countries, hunting, for, trophies, was, and, still, is, frowned, upon, hunting, in, north, america, in, the, 19th, century, was, done, primarily, as, a, way, to, supplement, food, supplies, although, it, is, now, undertaken, mainly, for, sport, the, safari, method, of, hunting, was, a, development, of, sport, hunting, that, saw, elaborate, travel, in, africa, india, and, other, places, in, pursuit, of, trophies, in, modern, times, trophy, hunting, persists, and, is, a, significant, industry, in, some, areas, according, to, the, u, s, fish, and, wildlife, service, hunting, provides, an, economic, incentive, for, ranchers, to, continue, to, breed, those, species, and, that, hunting, reduces, the, threat, of, the, species, extinction, a, scientific, study, in, the, journal, biological, conservation, states, that, trophy, hunting, is, of, major, importance, to, conservation, in, africa, by, creating, economic, incentives, for, conservation, over, vast, areas, including, areas, which, may, be, unsuitable, for, alternative, wildlife, based, land, uses, such, as, photographic, ecotourism, however, another, study, states, that, less, than, 3, of, a, trophy, hunters, expenditures, reach, the, local, level, meaning, that, the, economic, incentive, and, benefit, is, minimal, particularly, when, we, consider, the, vast, areas, of, land, that, hunting, concessions, occupy, financial, incentives, from, trophy, hunting, effectively, more, than, double, the, land, area, that, is, used, for, wildlife, conservation, relative, to, what, would, be, conserved, relying, on, national, parks, alone, according, to, biological, conservation, although, local, communities, usually, derive, no, more, than, 18, cents, per, hectare, from, trophy, hunting, trophy, hunting, has, been, considered, essential, for, providing, economic, incentives, to, conserve, large, carnivores, according, to, research, studies, in, conservation, biology, journal, of, sustainable, tourism, wildlife, conservation, by, sustainable, use, and, animal, conservation, studies, by, the, centre, for, responsible, tourism, and, the, iucn, state, that, ecotourism, which, includes, more, than, hunting, is, a, superior, economic, incentive, generating, twice, the, revenue, per, acre, and, 39, times, more, permanent, employment, at, the, cross, section, of, trophy, hunting, ecotourism, and, conservation, is, green, hunting, a, trophy, hunting, alternative, where, hunters, pay, to, dart, animals, that, need, to, be, tranquilized, for, conservation, projects, the, u, s, house, committee, on, natural, resources, in, 2016, concluded, that, trophy, hunting, may, be, contributing, to, the, extinction, of, certain, animals, animal, welfare, organizations, including, the, international, fund, for, animal, welfare, claim, that, trophy, hunting, is, a, key, factor, in, the, silent, extinction, of, giraffes, according, to, a, national, survey, that, the, u, s, fish, and, wildlife, service, conducts, every, five, years, fewer, people, are, hunting, even, as, population, rises, national, public, radio, reported, a, graph, shows, 2016, statistics, that, only, about, 5, per, cent, of, americans, 16, years, old, and, older, actually, hunt, which, is, half, of, what, it, was, 50, years, ago, the, decline, in, popularity, of, hunting, is, expected, to, accelerate, over, the, next, decade, which, threatens, how, us, will, pay, for, conservation, trophy, hunting, is, most, often, criticised, when, it, involves, rare, or, endangered, animals, opponents, may, also, see, trophy, hunting, as, an, issue, of, morality, or, animal, cruelty, criticising, the, killing, of, living, creatures, for, recreation, victorian, era, dramatist, w, s, gilbert, remarked, deer, stalking, would, be, a, very, fine, sport, if, only, the, deer, had, guns, there, is, also, debate, about, the, extent, to, which, trophy, hunting, benefits, the, local, economy, hunters, pay, substantial, fees, to, the, game, outfitters, and, hunting, guides, which, contributes, to, the, local, economy, and, provides, value, to, animals, that, would, otherwise, be, seen, as, competition, for, grazing, livestock, and, crops, however, the, argument, is, disputed, by, animal, welfare, organizations, and, other, opponents, of, trophy, hunting, it, is, argued, that, the, animals, are, worth, more, to, the, community, for, ecotourism, than, hunting, a, variety, of, industries, benefit, from, hunting, and, support, hunting, on, economic, grounds, in, tanzania, it, is, estimated, that, a, safari, hunter, spends, fifty, to, one, hundred, times, that, of, the, average, ecotourist, while, the, average, photo, tourist, may, seek, luxury, accommodation, the, average, safari, hunter, generally, stays, in, tented, camps, safari, hunters, are, also, more, likely, to, use, remote, areas, uninviting, to, the, typical, ecotourist, advocates, argue, that, these, hunters, allow, for, anti, poaching, activities, and, revenue, for, local, communities, in, the, united, kingdom, the, game, hunting, of, birds, as, an, industry, is, said, to, be, extremely, important, to, the, rural, economy, the, cobham, report, of, 1997, suggested, it, to, be, worth, around, 700, million, and, hunting, and, shooting, lobby, groups, claimed, it, to, be, worth, over, a, billion, pounds, less, than, ten, years, later, hunting, also, has, a, significant, financial, impact, in, the, united, states, with, many, companies, specialising, in, hunting, equipment, or, speciality, tourism, many, different, technologies, have, been, created, to, assist, hunters, today, s, hunters, come, from, a, broad, range, of, economic, social, and, cultural, backgrounds, in, 2001, over, thirteen, million, hunters, averaged, eighteen, days, hunting, and, spent, over, 20, 5, billion, on, their, sport, in, the, us, proceeds, from, hunting, licenses, contribute, to, state, game, management, programs, including, preservation, of, wildlife, habitat, hunting, contributes, to, a, portion, of, caloric, intake, of, people, and, may, have, positive, impacts, on, greenhouse, gas, emissions, by, avoidance, of, utilization, of, meat, raised, under, industrial, methods, lead, bullets, that, miss, their, target, or, remain, in, an, unretrieved, carcass, could, become, a, toxicant, in, the, environment, but, lead, in, ammunition, because, of, its, metallic, form, has, a, lower, solubility, and, higher, resistance, to, corrosion, than, other, forms, of, lead, making, it, hardly, available, to, biological, systems, waterfowl, or, other, birds, may, ingest, the, lead, and, poison, themselves, with, the, neurotoxicant, but, studies, have, demonstrated, that, effects, of, lead, in, ammunition, are, negligible, on, animal, population, size, and, growth, since, 1991, us, federal, law, forbids, lead, shot, in, waterfowl, hunts, and, 30, states, have, some, type, of, restriction, in, december, 2014, a, federal, appeals, court, denied, a, lawsuit, by, environmental, groups, that, the, epa, must, use, the, toxic, substances, control, act, to, regulate, lead, in, shells, and, cartridges, the, groups, sought, epa, to, regulate, spent, lead, yet, the, court, found, epa, could, not, regulate, spent, lead, without, also, regulating, cartridges, and, shells, hunters, have, been, driving, forces, throughout, history, in, the, movement, to, ensure, the, preservation, of, wildlife, habitats, and, wildlife, for, further, hunting, however, excessive, hunting, and, poachers, have, also, contributed, heavily, to, the, endangerment, extirpation, and, extinction, of, many, animals, such, as, the, quagga, the, great, auk, steller, s, sea, cow, the, thylacine, the, bluebuck, the, arabian, oryx, the, caspian, and, javan, tigers, the, markhor, the, sumatran, rhinoceros, the, bison, the,

stated, that, unsustainable, hunting, along, with, unsustainable, logging, and, fishing, are, primary, drivers, of, the, global, extinction, crisis, a, 2023, study, published, in, bioscience, posited, that, the, prioritizing, of, hunting, by, state, agencies, in, the, united, states, over, the, rewinding, of, key, species, is, reinforcing, the, loss, of, biodiversity, in, 1937, american, hunters, successfully, lobbied, the, us, congress, to, pass, the, pittman, robertson, wildlife, restoration, act, which, placed, an, eleven, per, cent, tax, on, all, hunting, equipment, this, self, imposed, tax, now, generates, over, 700, million, each, year, and, is, used, exclusively, to, establish, restore, and, protect, wildlife, habitats, the, act, is, named, for, nevada, senator, key, pittman, and, virginia, congressman, absalom, willis, robertson, on, 16, march, 1934, president, franklin, d, roosevelt, signed, the, migratory, bird, hunting, stamp, act, which, requires, an, annual, stamp, purchase, by, all, hunters, over, the, age, of, sixteen, the, stamps, are, created, on, behalf, of, the, program, by, the, us, postal, service, and, depict, wildlife, artwork, chosen, through, an, annual, contest, they, play, an, important, role, in, habitat, conservation, because, ninety, eight, per, cent, of, all, funds, generated, by, their, sale, go, directly, toward, the, purchase, or, lease, of, wetland, habitat, for, protection, in, the, national, wildlife, refuge, system, in, addition, to, waterfowl, it, is, estimated, that, one, third, of, the, nation, s, endangered, species, seek, food, and, shelter, in, areas, protected, using, duck, stamp, funds, since, 1934, the, sale, of, federal, duck, stamps, has, generated, 670, million, and, helped, to, purchase, or, lease, 5, 200, 000, acres, 8, 100, sq, mi, 21, 000, km, 2, of, habitat, the, stamps, serve, as, a, license, to, hunt, migratory, birds, an, entrance, pass, for, all, national, wildlife, refuge, areas, and, are, also, considered, collectors, items, often, purchased, for, aesthetic, reasons, outside, of, the, hunting, and, birding, communities, although, non, hunters, buy, a, significant, number, of, duck, stamps, eighty, seven, per, cent, of, their, sales, are, contributed, by, hunters, distribution, of, funds, is, managed, by, the, migratory, bird, conservation, commission, mbcc, the, arabian, oryx, a, species, of, large, antelope, once, inhabited, much, of, the, desert, areas, of, the, middle, east, native, bedouin, tribes, had, long, hunted, the, oryx, using, camels, and, arrows, oil, exploration, made, the, habitat, increasingly, accessible, and, the, species, striking, appearance, made, it, along, with, the, closely, related, scimitar, horned, oryx, and, addax, a, popular, quarry, for, sport, hunters, including, foreign, executives, of, oil, companies, the, use, of, automobiles, and, high, powered, rifles, destroyed, their, only, advantage, speed, and, they, became, extinct, in, the, wild, exclusively, due, to, sport, hunting, in, 1972, the, scimitar, horned, oryx, followed, suit, while, the, addax, became, critically, endangered, however, the, arabian, oryx, has, now, made, a, comeback, and, been, upgraded, from, extinct, in, the, wild, to, vulnerable, due, to, conservation, efforts, like, captive, breeding, the, markhor, is, an, endangered, species, of, wild, goat, which, inhabits, the, mountains, of, central, asia, and, pakistan, the, colonization, of, these, regions, by, britain, gave, british, sport, hunters, access, to, the, species, and, they, were, hunted, heavily, almost, to, the, point, of, extinction, only, their, willingness, to, breed, in, captivity, and, the, inhospitability, of, their, mountainous, habitat, prevented, this, despite, these, factors, the, markhor, is, still, endangered, the, american, bison, is, a, large, bovid, which, inhabited, much, of, western, north, america, prior, to, the, 1800s, living, on, the, prairies, in, large, herds, however, the, vast, herds, of, bison, attracted, market, hunters, who, killed, dozens, of, bison, for, their, hides, only, leaving, the, rest, to, rot, thousands, of, these, hunters, quickly, eliminated, the, bison, herds, bringing, the, population, from, several, million, in, the, early, 1800s, to, a, few, hundred, by, the, 1880s, conservation, efforts, have, allowed, the, population, to, increase, but, the, bison, remains, near, threatened, due, to, lack, of, habitat, the, journal, of, international, wildlife, law, and, policy, cites, that, the, legalization, of, white, rhinoceros, hunting, in, south, africa, motivated, private, landowners, to, reintroduce, the, species, onto, their, lands, as, a, result, the, country, saw, an, increase, in, white, rhinos, from, fewer, than, one, hundred, individuals, to, more, than, 11, 000, even, while, a, limited, number, were, killed, as, trophies, however, the, illegal, hunting, of, rhinoceros, for, their, horns, is, highly, damaging, to, the, population, and, is, currently, growing, globally, with, 1004, being, killed, in, south, africa, alone, according, to, the, most, recent, estimate, the, white, rhino, along, with, the, other, 4, rhino, species, are, poached, due, to, beliefs, that, the, rhinos, horns, can, be, used, to, cure, cancer, arthritis, and, other, diseases, and, illnesses, even, though, they, are, scientifically, proven, wrong, according, to, richard, conniff, namibia, is, home, to, 1, 750, of, the, roughly, 5, 000, black, rhinos, surviving, in, the, wild, because, it, allows, trophy, hunting, of, various, species, namibia, s, mountain, zebra, population, has, increased, to, 27, 000, from, 1, 000, in, 1982, elephants, which, are, gunned, down, elsewhere, for, their, ivory, have, gone, to, 20, 000, from, 15, 000, in, 1995, lions, which, were, on, the, brink, of, extinction, from, senegal, to, kenya, are, increasing, in, namibia, in, contrast, botswana, in, 2012, banned, trophy, hunting, following, a, precipitous, wildlife, decline, the, numbers, of, antelope, plummeted, across, botswana, with, a, resultant, decline, in, predator, numbers, while, elephant, numbers, remained, stable, and, hippopotamus, numbers, rose, according, to, the, government, of, botswana, trophy, hunting, is, at, least, partly, to, blame, for, this, but, many, other, factors, such, as, poaching, drought, and, habitat, loss, are, also, to, blame, uganda, recently, did, the, same, arguing, that, the, share, of, benefits, of, sport, hunting, were, lopsided, and, unlikely, to, deter, poaching, or, improve, capacity, to, manage, the, wildlife, reserves, in, 2020, botswana, reopened, trophy, hunting, on, public, lands, a, study, published, by, the, wildlife, society, concluded, that, hunting, and, trapping, are, cost, effective, tools, that, reduce, wildlife, damage, by, reducing, a, population, below, the, capacity, of, the, environment, to, carry, it, and, changing, the, behaviors, of, animals, to, stop, them, from, causing, damage, the, study, furthermore, states, that, the, cessation, of, hunting, could, cause, wildlife, to, be, severely, harmed, rural, property, values, to, fall, and, the, incentive, of, landowners, to, maintain, natural, habitats, to, diminish, although, deforestation, and, forest, degradation, have, long, been, considered, the, most, significant, threats, to, tropical, biodiversity, across, southeast, asia, northeast, india, indochina, sundaland, philippines, substantial, areas, of, natural, habitat, have, few, wild, animals, 1, kg, bar, a, few, hunting, tolerant, species, it, has, been, argued, by, animal, rights, activists, that, killing, animals, for, sport, is, unethical, cruel, and, unnecessary, they, note, the, suffering, and, cruelty, inflicted, on, animals, hunted, for, sport, many, animals, endure, prolonged, painful, deaths, when, they, are, injured, but, not, killed, by, hunters, hunting, disrupts, migration, and, hibernation, patterns, and, destroys, families, animal, rights, activists, also, comment, that, hunting, is, not, needed, to, maintain, an, ecological, balance, and, that, nature, takes, care, of, its, own, they, say, that, hunting, can, be, combated, on, public, lands, by, spread, deer, repellent, or, human, hair, from, barber, shops, near, hunting, areas, animal, rights, activists, also, argue, that, hunting, is, speciesist, whether, hunters, try, to, justify, their, killing, by, citing, human, deaths, caused, by, wild, animals, by, making, conservationist, claims, by, claiming, that, it, s, acceptable, to, hunt, as, long, as, the, animals, bodies, are, eaten, or, simply, because, of, the, pleasure, it, brings, them, the, fact, remains, that, hunting, is, morally, unacceptable, if, we, consider, the, interests, of, nonhuman, animals, hunted, animals, endure, fear, and, pain, and, then, are, deprived, of, their, lives, understanding, the, injustices, of, speciesism, and, the, interests, of, nonhuman, animals, makes, it, clear, that, human, pleasure, cannot, justify, nonhuman, animals, pain
