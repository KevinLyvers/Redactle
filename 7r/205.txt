the, ex, officio, chairperson, of, the, iit, council, in, the, late, 1940s, a, 22, member, committee, headed, by, nalini, ranjan, sarkar, recommended, the, establishment, of, these, institutions, in, various, parts, of, india, along, the, lines, of, the, massachusetts, institute, of, technology, mit, with, affiliated, secondary, institutions, the, first, indian, institute, of, technology, was, founded, in, may, 1950, at, the, site, of, the, hijli, detention, camp, in, kharagpur, west, bengal, the, name, indian, institute, of, technology, was, adopted, before, the, formal, inauguration, of, the, institute, on, 18, august, 1951, by, maulana, abul, kalam, azad, on, 15, september, 1956, the, parliament, of, india, passed, the, indian, institute, of, technology, kharagpur, act, declaring, it, as, an, institute, of, national, importance, jawaharlal, nehru, first, prime, minister, of, india, in, the, first, convocation, address, of, iit, kharagpur, in, 1956, said, here, in, the, place, of, that, hijli, detention, camp, stands, the, fine, monument, of, india, representing, india, s, urges, india, s, future, in, the, making, this, picture, seems, to, me, symbolically, of, the, changes, coming, to, india, on, the, recommendations, of, the, sarkar, committee, four, campuses, were, established, at, bombay, 1958, madras, 1959, kanpur, 1959, and, delhi, 1961, the, location, of, these, campuses, was, chosen, to, be, scattered, throughout, india, to, prevent, regional, imbalance, the, indian, institutes, of, technology, act, was, amended, to, reflect, the, addition, of, new,

regional, imbalance, 16, states, demanded, iits, since, the, s, k, joshi, committee, prescribed, strict, guidelines, for, institutions, aspiring, to, be, iits, only, seven, colleges, were, selected, for, final, consideration, plans, are, also, reported, to, open, iits, outside, india, although, there, has, not, been, much, progress, in, this, regard, eventually, in, the, 11th, five, year, plan, eight, states, were, identified, for, establishment, of, new, iits, from, 2008, to, 2009, eight, new, iits, were, set, up, in, gandhinagar, jodhpur, hyderabad, indore, patna, bhubaneswar, ropar, and,

iits, have, faced, allegations, of, caste, based, discrimination, instances, of, suicides, among, students, from, reserved, categories, are, often, cited, to, illustrate, this, ongoing, issue, however, it, s, important, to, note, that, the, suicide, rates, appear, to, be, consistent, among, students, from, both, reserved, and, non, reserved, categories, the, iits, have, faced, criticism, from, within, and, outside, academia, major, concerns, include, allegations, that, they, encourage, brain, drain, and, that, their, stringent, entrance, examinations, encourage, coaching, colleges, and, put, heavy, pressure, on, the, student, s, body, recently, some, prominent, iitians, have, also, questioned, the, quality, of, teaching, and, research, in, iits, with, the, tripling, the, number, of, iits, in, recent, decades, the, newly, created, institutes, have, struggled, to, establish, themselves, compared, to, their, peers, a, 2021, report, by, comptroller, and, auditor, general, of, india, criticized, the, newer, iits, for, not, meeting, targets, for, research, faculty, and, student, recruitment, students, retention, as, well, as, for, being, beset, with, infrastructure, delays, in, the, recent, past, the, number, of, student, suicides, has, attracted, significant, attention, among, the, criticisms, of, the, iit, system, by, the, media, and, academia, a, common, notion, is, that, it, encourages, brain, drain, until, liberalisation, started, in, the, early, 1990s, india, experienced, large, scale, emigration, of, iit, graduates, to, developed, countries, especially, to, the, united, states, since, 1953, nearly, twenty, five, thousand, iit, graduates, have, settled, in, the, us, since, the, us, benefited, from, subsidized, education, in, iits, at, the, cost, of, indian, taxpayers, money, critics, say, that, subsidising, education, in, iits, is, useless, others, support, the, emigration, of, graduates, arguing, that, the, capital, sent, home, by, the, iit, graduates, has, been, a, major, source, of, the, expansion, of, foreign, exchange, reserves, for, india, which, until, the, 1990s, had, a, substantial, trade, deficit, a, 2023, study, by, the, national, bureau, of, economic, research, found, that, among, the, top, 1, 000, jee, scorers, 36, migrated, abroad, while, for, the, top, 100, scorers, the, rate, was, 62, primarily, to, the, u, s, and, for, graduate, school, this, trend, has, been, reversed, somewhat, dubbed, the, reverse, brain, drain, as, hundreds, of, iit, graduates, who, have, pursued, further, studies, in, the, us, started, returning, to, india, in, the, 1990s, the, extent, of, intellectual, loss, receded, substantially, over, the, 1990s, and, 2000s, with, the, percentage, of, students, going, abroad, dropping, from, as, high, as, 70, at, one, time, to, around, 30, in, 2005, this, is, largely, attributed, to, the, liberalization, of, the, indian, economy, and, the, opening, of, previously, closed, markets, government, initiatives, are, encouraging, iit, students, into, entrepreneurship, programs, and, are, increasing, foreign, investment, emerging, scientific, and, manufacturing, industries, and, outsourcing, of, technical, jobs, from, north, america, and, western, europe, have, created, opportunities, for, aspiring, graduates, in, india, additionally, iit, alumni, are, giving, back, generously, to, their, parent, institutions, the, highly, competitive, examination, in, the, form, of, iit, jee, has, led, to, the, establishment, of, a, large, number, of, coaching, institutes, throughout, the, country, that, provide, intensive, and, specific, preparation, for, the, iit, jee, for, substantial, fees, it, is, argued, that, this, favours, students, from, specific, regions, and, richer, backgrounds, some, coaching, institutes, say, that, they, have, individually, coached, nearly, 800, successful, candidates, year, after, year, according, to, some, estimates, nearly, 95, of, all, students, who, clear, the, iit, jee, had, joined, coaching, classes, indeed, this, was, the, case, regarding, preparation, for, iit, entrance, exams, even, decades, ago, in, a, january, 2010, lecture, at, the, indian, institute, of, science, the, 2009, nobel, laureate, in, chemistry, venkatraman, ramakrishnan, revealed, that, he, failed, to, get, a, seat, at, any, of, the, indian,
