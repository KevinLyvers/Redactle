christian, democracy, is, a, political, ideology, inspired, by, christian, social, teaching, to, respond, to, the, challenges, of, contemporary, society, and, politics, christian, democracy, has, drawn, mainly, from, catholic, social, teaching, and, neo, scholasticism, as, well, as, the, neo, calvinist, tradition, within, christianity, it, later, gained, ground, with, lutherans, and, pentecostals, among, other, denominational, traditions, of, christianity, in, various, parts, of, the, world, during, the, nineteenth, century, its, principal, concerns, were, to, reconcile, catholicism, with, democracy, to, answer, the, social, question, surrounding, capitalism, and, the, working, class, and, to, resolve, the, tensions, between, church, and, state, in, the, twentieth, century, christian, democrats, led, postwar, western, and, southern, europe, in, building, modern, welfare, states, and, constructing, the, european, union, furthermore, in, the, late, twentieth, and, early, twenty, first, century, christian, democracy, has, gained, support, in, eastern, europe, among, former, communist, states, suffering, from, corruption, and, stagnation, on, the, european, left, right, political, spectrum, christian, democracy, has, been, difficult, to, pinpoint, as, christian, democrats, have, often, rejected, liberal, economics, and, individualism, and, advocated, state, intervention, while, simultaneously, defending, private, property, rights, against, excessive, state, intervention, this, has, meant, that, christian, democracy, has, historically, been, considered, centre, left, on, economics, and, centre, right, on, many, social, and, moral, issues, more, recently, christian, democrats, have, positioned, themselves, as, the, centre, right, as, with, both, the, european, people, s, party, and, european, christian, political, movement, with, which, many, christian, democratic, parties, in, europe, are, affiliated, christian, democrats, support, a, slightly, regulated, market, economy, featuring, an, effective, social, security, system, thus, a, social, market, economy, worldwide, many, christian, democratic, parties, are, members, of, the, centrist, democrat, international, examples, of, major, christian, democratic, parties, include, the, christian, democratic, union, of, germany, the, dutch, christian, democratic, appeal, the, centre, in, switzerland, the, spanish, people, s, party, the, mexican, national, action, party, the, austrian, people, s, party, and, the, christian, democratic, party, of, chile, many, christian, democratic, parties, in, the, americas, are, affiliated, with, the, christian, democrat, organization, of, america, christian, democracy, continues, to, be, influential, in, europe, and, latin, america, although, it, is, also, present, in, other, parts, of, the, world, as, a, generalization, it, can, be, said, that, christian, democratic, parties, in, europe, tend, to, be, moderately, conservative, and, in, several, cases, form, the, main, conservative, party, in, their, respective, countries, e, g, in, germany, spain, belgium, and, switzerland, such, as, the, christian, democratic, people, s, party, of, switzerland, the, christian, social, party, the, evangelical, people, s, party, of, switzerland, and, the, federal, democratic, union, of, switzerland, by, contrast, christian, democratic, parties, in, latin, america, tend, to, vary, in, their, position, on, the, political, spectrum, depending, on, the, country, they, are, in, being, either, more, left, leaning, as, in, the, case, of, the, christian, democratic, party, in, chile, or, more, right, leaning, as, in, the, case, of, the, national, action, party, in, mexico, geoffrey, k, roberts, and, patricia, hogwood, have, noted, that, christian, democracy, has, incorporated, many, of, the, views, held, by, liberals, conservatives, and, socialists, within, a, wider, framework, of, moral, and, christian, principles, christian, democrats, are, usually, socially, conservative, and, generally, have, a, relatively, skeptical, stance, towards, abortion, and, same, sex, marriage, although, some, christian, democratic, parties, have, accepted, the, limited, legalization, of, both, they, advocate, for, a, consistent, life, ethic, concerning, their, opposition, to, capital, punishment, and, assisted, suicide, christian, democrats, have, also, supported, the, prohibition, of, drugs, christian, democratic, parties, are, often, likely, to, assert, their, country, s, christian, heritage, and, explicitly, affirm, christian, ethics, rather, than, adopting, a, more, liberal, or, secular, stance, at, the, same, time, christian, democratic, parties, enshrine, confessional, liberty, christian, democracy, fosters, an, ecumenical, unity, achieved, on, the, religious, level, against, the, atheism, of, the, government, in, the, communist, countries, christian, democrats, views, include, traditional, moral, values, on, marriage, abortion, prohibition, of, drugs, etc, opposition, to, secularization, opposition, to, state, atheism, a, view, of, the, evolutionary, as, opposed, to, revolutionary, development, of, society, an, emphasis, on, law, and, order, and, a, rejection, of, communism, christian, democrats, are, open, to, change, for, example, in, the, structure, of, society, and, not, necessarily, supportive, of, the, social, status, quo, and, have, an, emphasis, on, human, rights, and, individual, initiative, a, rejection, of, secularism, and, an, emphasis, on, the, fact, that, the, individual, is, part, of, a, community, and, has, duties, towards, it, christian, democrats, hold, that, the, various, sectors, of, society, such, as, education, family, economy, and, state, have, autonomy, and, responsibility, over, their, sphere, a, concept, known, as, sphere, sovereignty, one, sphere, ought, not, to, dictate, the, obligations, of, another, social, entity, for, example, the, sphere, of, the, state, is, not, permitted, to, interfere, with, raising, children, a, role, that, belongs, to, the, sphere, of, the, family, within, the, sphere, of, government, christian, democrats, maintain, that, civil, issues, should, first, be, addressed, at, the, lowest, level, of, government, before, being, examined, at, a, higher, level, a, doctrine, known, as, subsidiarity, these, concepts, of, sphere, sovereignty, and, subsidiarity, are, considered, cornerstones, of, christian, democracy, political, ideology, christian, democrats, emphasize, community, social, justice, and, solidarity, alongside, supporting, a, welfare, state, labor, unions, and, support, for, regulation, of, market, forces, most, european, christian, democrats, reject, the, concept, of, class, struggle, and, instead, prefer, co, determination, while, us, christian, democrats, support, a, distributist, economic, system, containing, widespread, distribution, of, productive, property, in, particular, increased, worker, ownership, workplace, democracy, and, management, workers, self, management, of, their, production, the, christian, democratic, welfare, state, aims, at, supporting, families, and, often, relies, on, intermediary, institutions, to, deliver, social, services, and, social, insurance, often, with, the, support, of, the, state, christian, democrats, support, the, principle, of, stewardship, which, upholds, the, idea, that, humans, should, safeguard, the, planet, for, future, generations, of, life, christian, democrats, also, tend, to, have, a, conciliatory, view, concerning, immigration, no, single, author, has, been, recognized, by, all, christian, democrats, as, the, leading, christian, democratic, thinker, but, jacques, maritain, comes, closest, thus, in, terms, of, impact, he, is, in, no, way, akin, to, karl, marx, edmund, burke, or, john, locke, other, authors, critical, to, forming, christian, democratic, ideology, include, pope, leo, xiii, pope, pius, xi, emmanuel, mounier, heinrich, pesch, abraham, kuyper, and, luigi, sturzo, christian, democracy, can, trace, its, philosophical, roots, to, thomas, aquinas, and, his, thoughts, on, aristotelian, ontology, and, the, christian, tradition, according, to, aquinas, human, rights, are, based, on, natural, law, and, are, defined, as, the, things, humans, need, to, function, correctly, for, example, food, is, a, human, right, because, without, food, humans, cannot, function, properly, aquinas, affirmed, that, humans, are, images, of, the, divine, which, follows, human, dignity, and, equality, all, humans, are, equal, because, they, all, share, that, nature, aquinas, also, affirmed, the, natural, reality, of, family, and, household, based, on, the, lifelong, commitment, of, husband, and, wife, perfected, with, children, a, unit, that, has, priority, over, other, communities, aquinas, also, argued, that, public, power, could, legitimately, appropriate, private, owners, of, their, resources, for, the, common, good, when, used, for, people, in, genuine, need, when, leo, xiii, became, pope, he, issued, the, papal, encyclical, aeterni, patris, which, rehabilitated, scholastic, philosophy, the, pope, highlighted, aquinas, s, views, on, liberty, authority, laws, justice, and, charity, in, this, encyclical, aquinas, s, ideas, would, later, be, the, foundation, for, the, idea, of, subsidiarity, alongside, the, ideas, that, the, state, is, to, serve, the, people, and, that, there, is, universal, solidarity, amongst, humanity, a, significant, neo, scholastic, was, jacques, maritain, who, attempted, to, reconcile, democracy, and, human, rights, with, thomist, natural, law, maritain, argued, that, human, rights, are, based, on, natural, law, and, that, democracy, needs, christianity, to, succeed, jacques, maritain, would, use, thomist, ideas, of, property, to, reduce, inequality, arguing, that, the, state, should, be, involved, if, individuals, do, not, use, their, property, correctly, jacques, maritain, and, emmanuel, mounier, would, also, use, thomist, thinking, in, developing, their, idea, of, personalism, another, intellectual, element, of, christian, democracy, was, neo, calvinism, the, neo, calvinist, political, ideas, relied, on, john, calvin, s, ideas, of, the, sovereignty, of, god, and, common, grace, god, s, sovereignty, was, particularly, useful, in, light, of, the, french, revolution, and, notions, of, individual, and, state, sovereignty, it, was, the, basis, of, sphere, sovereignty, which, helped, the, interests, of, reformed, christians, which, have, historically, been, a, minority, in, sphere, sovereignty, each, sphere, has, its, activity, area, related, to, god, within, this, view, of, sphere, sovereignty, it, was, the, state, s, role, to, pursue, public, justice, another, element, was, that, life, is, religious, and, politics, should, reflect, this, the, development, of, orthodox, christian, democracy, has, been, held, back, by, the, fact, that, orthodox, politics, has, not, received, church, support, in, the, way, that, rerum, novarum, encouraged, christian, democracy, or, how, early, christian, democrats, such, as, luigi, sturzo, received, tacit, consent, for, his, political, activities, russian, christian, democrats, for, example, have, had, to, develop, a, doctrine, of, democracy, academics, have, noted, a, few, ideas, key, to, christian, democracy, including, personalism, solidarity, or, some, variant, of, social, capitalism, popularism, or, some, variant, of, its, catch, all, nature, notions, of, pluralism, which, in, a, vertical, sense, relates, to, subsidiarity, and, in, a, horizontal, sense, denotes, sphere, sovereignty, and, stewardship, personalism, is, a, political, doctrine, generally, linked, to, emmanuel, mounier, it, focuses, on, the, person, their, intellect, responsibilities, and, value, it, stresses, that, humans, are, free, beings, with, dignity, and, political, rights, but, these, rights, must, be, used, for, the, common, good, it, also, stresses, that, true, human, freedom, is, used, in, line, with, god, s, will, it, is, against, the, individualist, and, collectivist, notions, of, humanity, it, also, stresses, that, people, become, full, when, they, are, members, of, their, communities, in, practical, policy, it, leads, to, a, few, conclusions, personalism, has, generally, been, the, underlying, basis, in, christian, democracy, that, leads, to, human, rights, especially, in, relation, to, a, right, to, life, a, right, to, family, and, a, right, to, aid, a, right, to, suffrage, freedom, of, conscience, and, freedom, of, religion, modern, personalist, views, also, are, inspired, by, ecologist, values, rowan, williams, contrasts, personalism, which, he, describes, as, a, relation, between, humans, and, god, to, modern, day, capitalism, which, is, focused, only, on, endless, economic, growth, which, is, harmful, to, the, natural, environment, the, christian, democratic, political, economy, has, not, tethered, itself, to, one, third, way, between, capitalism, and, socialism, but, rather, various, ways, between, capitalism, and, socialism, over, time, christian, democrats, moved, from, solidarism, to, a, social, market, economy, initially, many, catholic, political, movements, in, the, 19th, century, opposed, capitalism, and, socialism, equally, as, both, were, based, on, materialism, and, social, conflict, initially, the, system, that, catholics, advocated, was, one, of, corporatism, based, on, bringing, back, a, guild, organized, economy, the, idea, was, a, society, where, individuals, were, organized, by, their, economic, position, in, these, corporatist, systems, the, fathers, were, the, head, of, families, one, of, these, conceptions, was, that, of, franz, von, baader, who, advocated, for, proletariat, enfranchisement, in, the, corporatist, system, baader, is, recognized, as, the, first, person, to, advocate, for, workplace, codetermination, codetermination, would, become, a, key, point, of, unity, amongst, the, christian, democratic, trade, unions, in, the, 19th, century, and, early, 20th, century, the, lutheran, social, christians, advocated, an, authoritarian, view, of, corporatism, and, the, neo, calvinist, corporatist, idea, has, been, credited, as, an, inspiration, for, the, polder, system, that, currently, exists, in, the, netherlands, many, of, these, corporatisms, would, advance, the, idea, of, replacing, the, elected, parliament, with, corporative, parliament, recognizing, the, various, corporate, estates, of, the, nation, industrialists, small, businesses, peasants, landowners, workers, etc, the, papal, encyclical, rerum, novarum, would, recognize, some, of, the, principles, behind, corporatism, the, christian, democratic, notion, of, corporatism, was, found, within, heinrich, pesch, s, solidarism, pesch, s, solidarism, argued, for, international, solidarity, based, on, shared, humanity, national, solidarity, based, on, shared, nationality, familiar, solidarity, for, family, members, and, class, and, cross, class, solidarity, based, on, shared, interests, in, the, workplace, this, latter, solidarity, focused, on, occupational, associations, advancing, collective, interests, codetermination, and, a, third, house, of, parliament, that, would, advise, on, economic, matters, heinrich, pesch, s, idea, of, corporatism, would, be, a, qualified, notion, of, subsidiarity, pesch, s, ideas, would, be, influential, in, the, papal, encyclical, quadragesimo, anno, given, that, pesch, s, disciple, oswald, von, nell, breuning, would, draft, the, document, quadragesimo, anno, was, significant, in, legitimatizing, the, push, for, a, corporatist, system, and, subjected, it, to, the, notion, of, subsidiarity, around, this, time, corporatism, became, increasingly, prominent, among, young, catholics, frustrated, with, parliamentary, politics, and, in, many, instances, would, inspire, authoritarian, and, fascist, regimes, movements, in, austria, france, spain, portugal, and, germany, eventually, corporatism, fell, out, of, the, political, debate, due, to, this, association, with, authoritarian, and, fascist, regimes, another, economic, idea, within, christian, democracy, is, the, social, market, economy, which, is, widely, influential, across, much, of, continental, europe, the, social, market, is, an, essentially, free, market, economy, based, on, a, free, price, system, and, private, property, however, it, supports, government, activity, to, promote, competitive, markets, with, a, comprehensive, social, welfare, system, and, effective, public, services, to, address, social, inequalities, resulting, from, free, market, outcomes, the, market, is, seen, not, as, an, end, but, as, a, means, of, generating, wealth, to, achieve, broader, social, goals, and, maintain, societal, cohesion, the, basis, of, the, social, market, economy, is, ordoliberalism, or, german, neoliberalism, an, idea, related, to, thinkers, such, as, walter, eucken, franz, b, hm, ludwig, erhard, wilhelm, r, pke, and, alfred, m, ller, armack, ordoliberals, viewed, the, concentration, of, power, as, a, significant, danger, to, liberty, they, desired, an, economic, constitution, that, would, ensure, competition, in, markets, and, free, decisions, where, people, are, uninfluenced, by, the, government, as, a, result, of, the, economic, constitution, this, model, is, mildly, corporatist, this, model, of, capitalism, sometimes, called, rhine, alpine, capitalism, or, social, capitalism, is, contrasted, with, anglo, american, capitalism, or, enterprise, capitalism, whereas, the, anglo, capitalist, model, aims, to, remove, restrictions, on, capitalism, and, enable, individual, prosperity, the, rhinish, model, embeds, the, market, into, the, social, framework, with, the, goals, of, nation, building, and, of, taking, care, of, citizens, beginning, in, the, 1980s, european, christian, democratic, parties, have, partially, adopted, neo, liberal, policies, however, christian, democrats, in, the, american, solidarity, party, instead, adopted, distributism, the, promotion, of, the, christian, democratic, concepts, of, sphere, sovereignty, and, subsidiarity, led, to, the, creation, of, corporatist, welfare, states, throughout, the, world, that, continue, to, exist, to, this, day, in, keeping, with, the, christian, democratic, concepts, of, the, cultural, mandate, and, the, preferential, option, for, the, poor, christian, justice, is, viewed, as, demanding, that, the, welfare, of, all, people, especially, the, poor, and, vulnerable, must, be, protected, because, every, human, being, has, dignity, being, made, in, the, image, of, god, in, many, countries, christian, democrats, organized, labor, unions, that, competed, with, communist, and, social, democratic, unions, in, contrast, to, conservatism, s, stance, against, worker, organizations, in, solidarity, with, these, labor, unions, in, belgium, for, example, christian, democrats, have, lobbied, for, sunday, blue, laws, that, guarantee, workers, and, civil, servants, a, day, of, rest, in, line, with, historic, christian, sabbath, principles, another, example, of, a, christian, inspired, workers, movement, is, the, catholic, worker, movement, established, by, dorothy, day, which, not, only, fought, for, better, working, standards, but, also, contributed, to, promoting, the, idea, of, pacifism, and, a, just, war, popolarismo, or, popularism, is, a, political, doctrine, conceived, by, don, luigi, sturzo, however, in, reality, this, was, christian, democracy, in, the, political, sphere, the, papal, encyclical, graves, de, communi, re, prohibited, christian, democracy, to, be, a, political, ideology, and, so, sturzo, used, the, term, popularism, instead, popularism, helped, european, catholics, come, to, accept, democracy, and, so, the, idea, has, been, linked, to, christian, democratic, ideas, of, democracy, which, sturzo, defined, as, the, political, and, social, system, resting, on, the, free, organic, participation, of, the, whole, people, in, the, common, good, academics, have, tied, the, idea, of, popularism, to, the, way, christian, democratic, parties, encompass, sections, of, the, whole, population, this, results, from, the, inherent, religious, center, allowing, cut, across, class, divisions, in, realization, of, this, christian, democratic, parties, tend, to, invoke, the, title, people, s, parties, academic, carlo, invernizzi, accetti, links, the, idea, of, popularism, to, proportional, representation, pillarization, and, consociational, democracy, the, christian, democratic, notion, of, pluralism, is, about, how, humans, are, generally, embedded, in, a, social, framework, john, witte, explaining, the, origin, of, christian, democracy, describes, pluralism, thus, both, protestant, and, catholic, parties, inveighed, against, the, reductionist, extremes, and, social, failures, of, liberal, democracies, and, social, democracies, liberal, democracies, they, believed, had, sacrificed, the, community, for, the, individual, social, democracies, had, sacrificed, the, individual, for, the, community, both, parties, returned, to, a, traditional, christian, teaching, of, social, pluralism, or, subsidiarity, which, stressed, the, dependence, and, participation, of, the, individual, in, family, church, school, business, and, other, associations, both, parties, stressed, the, responsibility, of, the, state, to, respect, and, protect, the, individual, in, community, sphere, sovereignty, stresses, the, horizontal, element, social, communities, have, roles, they, must, uphold, and, certain, liberty, and, autonomy, here, the, government, had, the, role, of, policing, the, spheres, subsidiarity, is, the, vertical, element, where, the, state, has, the, role, of, protecting, and, regulating, the, spheres, the, state, must, not, interfere, if, these, communities, are, behaving, effectively, this, also, means, that, a, state, can, intervene, when, these, communities, are, not, competent, in, practice, subsidiarity, has, been, used, to, justify, the, creation, of, international, organizations, as, higher, international, authorities, need, to, exist, to, police, nation, states, the, idea, of, stewardship, has, traditionally, been, linked, to, managerial, skills, regarding, property, and, income, stewardship, can, be, found, in, neo, calvinist, abraham, kuyper, s, works, where, it, relates, to, a, person, s, responsibilities, over, what, is, entrusted, to, them, especially, their, property, in, social, catholic, circles, in, the, 1970s, stewardship, was, explicitly, linked, to, environmental, matters, stewardship, was, found, in, the, first, programs, of, the, christian, democratic, appeal, and, from, here, alongside, the, works, of, american, bishops, the, idea, would, spread, to, other, christian, democratic, parties, they, view, competent, and, efficient, government, as, emblematic, of, a, just, steward, which, includes, just, stewardship, over, environmental, matters, pope, francis, took, a, firm, stance, on, environmentalism, in, the, papal, encyclical, laudato, si, in, 2015, here, the, idea, of, stewardship, comes, from, the, correct, translation, of, genesis, where, god, entrusts, man, with, stewardship, of, the, earth, the, origins, of, christian, democracy, go, back, to, the, french, revolution, where, initially, french, republicanism, and, the, catholic, church, were, deeply, hostile, to, one, another, as, the, revolutionary, governments, had, attacked, the, church, confiscated, the, church, s, lands, persecuted, its, priests, and, attempted, to, establish, new, religions, first, the, cult, of, reason, and, then, the, cult, of, the, supreme, being, after, the, decades, following, the, french, revolution, the, catholic, church, saw, the, rise, of, liberalism, as, a, threat, to, catholic, values, the, rise, of, capitalism, and, the, resulting, industrialization, and, urbanization, of, society, were, seen, to, be, destroying, traditional, communal, and, family, life, according, to, the, catholic, church, liberal, economics, promoted, selfishness, and, materialism, with, the, liberal, emphasis, on, individualism, tolerance, and, free, expression, enabling, all, kinds, of, self, indulgence, and, permissiveness, to, thrive, consequently, for, much, of, the, 19th, century, the, catholic, church, was, hostile, to, democracy, and, liberalism, this, hostility, to, democracy, and, liberalism, would, be, challenged, by, liberal, catholics, who, believed, the, alliance, between, the, church, and, aristocracy, was, a, barrier, to, the, church, s, mission, initially, this, group, desired, to, reconcile, the, catholics, with, the, state, of, modern, politics, getting, catholics, involved, in, parties, public, action, and, parliamentarianism, this, however, was, not, an, endorsement, of, democracy, and, the, liberal, catholics, maintained, they, did, not, adhere, to, liberalism, eventually, the, movement, s, leading, figures, such, as, f, licit, de, la, mennais, would, become, more, accepting, of, democracy, the, group, came, to, be, associated, with, a, desire, for, a, free, press, freedom, of, association, and, worship, and, free, education, around, this, time, catholic, social, thought, developed, with, social, catholic, theologians, and, activists, advocating, the, interests, of, workers, in, society, some, activists, such, as, fr, d, ric, ozanam, the, society, of, st, vincent, de, paul, founder, were, more, amenable, to, liberal, democracy, ozanam, criticized, economic, liberalism, and, the, commodification, of, labor, and, argued, that, charity, was, insufficient, to, deal, with, these, problems, and, that, labor, associations, and, state, intervention, were, needed, italian, popular, party, leader, luigi, sturzo, credits, ozanam, as, the, first, christian, democrat, one, of, the, more, influential, theologians, in, germany, was, wilhelm, von, ketteler, who, encouraged, catholics, to, accept, the, modern, state, ketteler, argued, for, productive, associations, with, profit, sharing, christian, trade, unions, and, general, workers, rights, in, the, 1870s, catholic, political, movements, arose, independently, of, the, catholic, church, to, defend, catholic, interests, from, the, liberal, states, in, europe, generally, the, liberal, states, desired, to, wrestle, control, over, the, catholic, education, system, however, in, germany, and, italy, this, was, a, direct, attack, against, the, church, the, catholic, political, movements, specifically, opposed, liberal, secularism, and, state, control, of, education, the, parties, that, came, out, of, these, movements, include, the, centre, party, germany, the, catholic, party, belgium, various, catholic, parties, in, the, netherlands, and, the, christian, social, party, austria, initially, most, of, these, parties, accepted, the, anti, liberal, beliefs, of, the, catholic, church, at, the, time, many, catholics, behind, these, movements, believed, all, spheres, of, life, should, be, regulated, by, religion, these, movements, were, initially, built, by, ultramontanes, were, against, the, liberal, view, that, church, and, state, must, be, separated, and, used, the, term, christian, democracy, in, opposition, to, liberal, democracy, the, centre, party, in, germany, seems, to, be, an, exception, to, this, trend, in, that, they, defended, the, catholic, church, through, an, appeal, to, liberal, freedoms, and, democracy, additionally, the, centre, party, inspired, by, ketteler, supported, social, legislation, despite, the, thoroughly, pro, catholic, position, of, these, movements, the, church, itself, resisted, the, movements, seeing, them, as, a, challenge, to, the, church, s, control, of, the, laity, over, time, the, impact, of, electoral, politics, on, these, parties, pushed, them, to, be, more, accepting, of, liberal, democracy, to, form, effective, political, coalitions, these, parties, evolved, from, catholic, parties, to, parties, inspired, by, christianity, and, turned, to, voters, not, the, catholic, church, for, legitimacy, during, this, time, the, catholic, parties, took, an, inter, class, nature, such, that, they, comprised, trade, unionists, landlords, industrialists, peasants, and, artisans, which, academics, have, linked, to, the, notion, of, popularism, protestant, confessional, politics, was, more, wide, and, varied, the, most, significant, movement, was, in, the, netherlands, where, reformed, neo, calvinist, protestants, founded, the, anti, revolutionary, party, similarly, to, the, catholics, this, party, was, formed, out, of, similar, concerns, with, liberal, control, of, education, the, party, was, against, the, ideas, of, the, french, revolution, and, its, founder, abraham, kuyper, held, that, the, government, derived, its, authority, from, god, not, from, the, people, however, kuyper, and, the, anti, revolutionary, party, did, support, organic, democratic, representation, and, promoted, universal, household, suffrage, in, germany, this, element, came, from, the, lutheran, adolf, stoecker, who, established, the, christian, social, party, and, those, who, followed, him, the, christian, social, movement, aimed, to, challenge, marxist, socialism, so, stoecker, supported, pro, worker, economic, policies, to, win, over, the, working, class, however, when, this, failed, stoecker, turned, to, anti, semitism, in, switzerland, stoecker, and, his, fellow, allies, generated, some, interest, in, protestant, political, organization, but, protestants, largely, accepted, the, predominance, of, liberalism, so, there, was, only, minor, growth, of, a, protestant, political, movement, the, papacy, of, pope, leo, xiii, was, a, turning, point, in, the, development, of, christian, democracy, and, he, attempted, to, infuse, democracy, and, liberalism, with, catholic, values, in, the, papal, encyclical, rerum, novarum, in, 1891, pope, leo, xiii, recognized, workers, misery, and, argued, for, means, to, improve, workers, conditions, he, also, attacked, economic, liberalism, and, condemned, the, rise, of, socialism, and, generally, encouraged, a, corporatist, approach, to, labor, relations, rerum, novarum, would, provide, catholic, labor, movements, with, an, intellectual, platform, and, would, coincide, with, the, rise, of, christian, trade, unions, across, europe, it, was, the, catalyst, for, the, beginning, of, christian, democracy, in, france, italy, and, austria, the, same, year, as, the, release, of, rerum, novarum, abraham, kuyper, organized, the, christian, social, congress, alongside, the, protestant, workers, movement, where, kuyper, outlined, their, social, principles, and, policy, these, actions, reinforced, the, push, for, christian, social, action, in, the, netherlands, in, graves, de, communi, re, the, pope, would, protest, against, using, christian, democracy, as, a, political, label, preferring, it, to, describe, a, social, movement, some, academics, consider, the, catholic, political, parties, around, this, time, to, be, essentially, catholic, and, not, christian, democratic, however, others, consider, the, new, italian, people, s, party, and, the, popular, democratic, party, france, christian, democratic, these, parties, advocated, political, liberties, religious, liberties, economic, reform, and, social, partnership, policies, to, support, democracy, and, internationalism, the, italian,

into, a, christian, democratic, party, uniting, catholics, and, protestants, in, belgium, the, rising, workers, movement, came, to, form, the, increasingly, powerful, christian, democratic, faction, of, the, catholic, party, this, period, also, saw, other, catholic, parties, forming, bavarian, catholics, broke, away, and, formed, the, bavarian, people, s, party, due, to, the, centre, party, s, participation, in, establishing, the, weimar, republic, in, switzerland, catholics, formed, the, swiss, conservative, people, s, party, which, as, a, party, was, divided, between, three, competing, demographics, rural, catholics, who, wanted, greater, regional, independence, catholic, workers, who, wanted, economic, reform, and, the, more, conservative, groups, who, opposed, democracy, overall, the, party, was, held, together, by, the, catholic, faith, and, anti, socialist, and, anti, liberal, tendencies, in, ireland, fianna, f, il, was, founded, as, a, catholic, political, party, fine,

it, was, built, on, the, work, of, pietist, lutherans, and, the, party, was, initially, founded, to, defend, the, country, s, christian, heritage, against, the, rise, of, secularization, there, was, cooperation, between, the, protestant, and, catholic, parties, during, this, period, the, catholic, and, protestant, parties, would, form, joint, governments, in, the, netherlands, and, germany, however, this, cooperation, did, not, challenge, the, underlying, differences, between, the, movements, in, germany, there, was, tension, from, cooperation, with, protestants, while, in, the, netherlands, the, anti, revolutionaries, would, not, support, pro, vatican, policies, a, significant, factor, that, helped, christian, democracy, during, this, period, was, the, lay, catholic, action, movements, these, organizations, stress, the, apostolate, of, the, laity, which, is, the, role, of, everyday, catholics, in, spreading, the, faith, in, practice, these, movements, helped, support,

doctrine, of, the, church, the, encyclical, doubled, down, on, the, pronouncements, of, rerum, novarum, on, economic, liberalism, and, socialism, the, attack, against, socialism, was, broadened, to, include, moderate, socialism, and, within, the, encyclical, the, pope, outlined, a, corporatist, structure, of, society, based, on, the, notion, of, subsidiarity, however, the, pope, would, stress, the, autonomy, of, this, corporatist, system, to, distinguish, it, from, fascism, this, quadragesimo, anno, would, come, to, influence, the, economic, programs, of, catholic, parties, of, the, time, such, as, the, popular, democratic, party, and, the, dutch, roman, catholic, state, party, alongside, influencing, belgian, catholics, the, centre, party, christian, social, party, and, swiss,

49, years, of, 53, even, in, france, they, were, influential, up, to, 1962, in, the, post, war, period, christian, democratic, parties, became, more, conservative, partially, in, response, to, communism, and, secularism, the, christian, democrats, also, won, the, women, s, vote, in, their, respective, countries, due, to, the, pro, family, policies, of, christian, democrats, christian, democrats, pursued, decentralization, policies, during, this, time, encouraging, regionalism, in, germany, italy, and, belgium, this, was, sought, with, increased, favor, as, a, result, of, experiencing, fascism, christian, democratic, parties, were, also, crucial, in, pushing, for, codeterminative, works, councils, and, workers, on, boards, during, this, time, despite, this, initial, power, cracks, started, to, appear, christian, democracy, in, france, declined, substantially, as, popular, republican, movement, and, its, successors, quickly, fell, apart, french, christian, democrats, would, ultimately, become, subsumed, into, gaullist, parties, similarly, minor, christian, democratic, parties, such, as, the, people, s, democratic, party, pdp, would, rise, in, post, franco, spain, however, these, movements, were, too, divided, and, lacked, the, political, necessity, of, religious, cleavages, to, play, a, dominant, role, in, spanish, democracy, these, christian, democratic, parties, would, fail, and, the, christian, democrats, would, join, the, spanish, popular, party, protestant, christian, democracy, developed, in, multifaceted, ways, in, the, post, war, period, in, germany, it, arose, amongst, the, lutheran, ordoliberals, these, lutherans, looked, to, christian, theologians, such, as, karl, barth, and, dietrich, bonhoeffer, to, path, a, way, that, obeyed, worldly, authority, but, also, challenged, the, nazi, regime, the, core, of, the, ordoliberal, ideology, was, a, strong, state, that, enabled, market, competition, during, the, war, the, ordoliberals, worked, with, bonhoeffer, to, develop, a, political, and, socio, economic, plan, for, the, post, war, period, and, after, the, war, they, joined, with, catholics, to, form, the, christian, democratic, union, the, ordoliberals, termed, their, vision, a, social, market, economy, a, vision, the, catholics, would, also, come, to, champion, in, sweden, it, arose, amongst, the, pentecostals, where, it, coalesced, in, the, christian, democrats, founded, in, 1964, as, a, reaction, to, secularization, the, finnish, christian, democrats, formed, in, 1957, and, the, danish, christian, people, s, party, formed, in, 1970, defended, christian, schooling, and, dissented, against, secular, trends, such, as, atheism, and, liberal, abortion, policies, the, nordic, christian,

significant, force, in, the, creation, of, the, european, union, at, the, beginning, of, the, european, project, three, significant, men, were, konrad, adenauer, robert, schuman, and, alcide, de, gasperi, all, christian, democrats, when, the, rome, treaty, was, signed, christian, democrats, were, the, leading, governments, in, four, of, the, six, countries, germany, italy, belgium, and, luxembourg, and, were, a, part, of, the, coalition, government, in, the, netherlands, at, the, time, at, least, until, the, mid, 1980s, social, democrats, were, hostile, to, the, institutions, of, the, european, communities, even, in, the, 1970s, swedish, prime, minister, olof, palme, called, the, european, commission, conservative, capitalist, clerical, and, colonialist, indeed, the, european, union, has, the, ideas, of, subsidiarity, and, personalism, embedded, within, it, the, influence, of, christian, democracy, on, the, european, union, is, such, that, one, academic, has, called, the, european, union, a, christian, democracy, alongside, the, european, union, was, the, development, of, european, christian, democratic, parties, this, appeared, in, the, 1940s, with, the, nouvelles, equipes, internationales, which, would, evolve, into, the, european, union, of, christian, democrats, in, 1965, and, finally, the, european, people, s, party, in, 1976, christian, democratic, parties, no, longer, have, as, much, power, in, european, politics, indeed, in, italy, the, christian, democratic, party, collapsed, the, reasons, for, the, decline, in, christian, democracy, are, multifaceted, partly, due, to, european, secularization, and, the, loss, of, a, voting, base, the, death, of, communism, and, the, rise, of, neo, liberalism, have, also, dented, the, movement, and, the, financial, crisis, has, also, shown, flaws, in, christian, democratic, welfare, furthermore, immigration, and, the, rise, of, populism, have, further, put, pressure, on, christian, democracy, as, it, is, torn, between, the, right, s, call, for, restrictions, the, businesses, call, for, an, open, labor, market, and, the, religious, call, for, more, charity, to, immigrants, some, christian, democratic, parties, particularly, in, europe, no, longer, emphasize, religion, and, have, become, much, more, secular, in, recent, years, recently, many, minor, christian, democratic, parties, such, as, the, christian, union, and, others, across, europe, did, not, feel, represented, in, the, existing, political, establishment, so, they, formed, a, political, organization, in, the, european, christian, political, movement, these, parties, stressed, the, christian, history, of, europe, alongside, advocating, for, traditional, christian, values, and, economic, and, environmental, justice, many, muslim, parties, in, muslim, countries, have, looked, to, the, christian, democratic, tradition, for, inspiration, the, most, notable, is, turkey, s, ruling, justice, and, development, party, usually, known, by, the, turkish, acronym, akp, for, adalet, ve, kalk, nma, partisi, which, is, islamic, and, has, moved, towards, the, tradition, however, this, link, is, questioned, given, that, akp, s, movement, toward, christian, democracy, may, be, to, curry, the, favor, of, european, parties, in, european, integration, something, the, european, christian, democrats, ultimately, shot, down, other, islamic, groups, that, have, been, linked, include, the, democratic, league, of, kosovo, and, mohammad, morsi, in, egypt, some, muslim, democratic, parties, embraced, by, christian, democrats, are, the, national, awakening, party, indonesia, and, the, lakas, christian, muslim, democrats, philippines, who, have, joined, the, centrist, democrat, international, the, international,

were, generally, conservative, and, their, main, aim, was, to, protect, the, interests, of, the, catholic, church, these, parties, viewed, christianity, as, the, origin, and, soul, of, democratic, values, and, advocated, an, organic, conception, of, society, decentralization, and, corporatism, christian, democrats, would, become, more, progressive, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, partially, due, to, the, consequences, of, the, second, vatican, council, between, 1961, and, 1963, this, led, to, the, growth, of, liberation, theology, in, latin, american, catholicism, which, stressed, class, conflict, over, the, christian, democratic, class, mediation, furthermore, due, to, the, us, policy, against, socialism, in, latin, america, christian, democratic, parties, could, position, themselves, as, progressive, and, demand, social, reforms, furthermore, christian, democrats, accepted, modernism, and, technocracy, and, began, to, advocate, centralized, planning, in, the, 1980s, due, to, international, trends, such, as, the, washington, consensus, christian, democrats, accepted, neoliberal, policies, in, their, nations, leading, to, future, electoral, losses, throughout, this, period, christian, democratic, parties, have, played, a, force, for, democracy, such, as, copei, which, helped, establish, democratic, venezuela, and, the, pdc, in, chile, the, main, opposition,
