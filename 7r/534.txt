torture, is, the, deliberate, infliction, of, severe, pain, or, suffering, on, a, person, for, reasons, including, punishment, extracting, a, confession, interrogation, for, information, or, intimidating, third, parties, some, definitions, restrict, torture, to, acts, carried, out, by, the, state, while, others, include, non, state, organizations, most, victims, of, torture, are, poor, and, marginalized, people, suspected, of, crimes, although, torture, against, political, prisoners, or, during, armed, conflict, has, received, disproportionate, attention, judicial, corporal, punishment, and, capital, punishment, are, sometimes, seen, as, forms, of, torture, but, this, label, is, internationally, controversial, a, variety, of, methods, of, torture, are, used, often, in, combination, the, most, common, form, of, physical, torture, is, beatings, beginning, in, the, twentieth, century, many, torturers, have, preferred, non, scarring, or, psychological, methods, to, maintain, deniability, torturers, more, commonly, act, out, of, fear, or, due, to, limited, resources, rather, than, sadism, although, most, torturers, are, thought, to, learn, about, torture, techniques, informally, and, rarely, receive, explicit, orders, they, are, enabled, by, organizations, that, facilitate, and, encourage, their, behavior, once, a, torture, program, begins, it, usually, escalates, beyond, what, is, intended, initially, and, often, leads, to, involved, agencies, losing, effectiveness, torture, aims, to, break, the, victim, s, will, destroy, their, agency, and, personality, and, is, cited, as, one, of, the, most, damaging, experiences, that, a, person, can, undergo, many, victims, suffer, both, physical, damage, chronic, pain, is, particularly, common, and, mental, sequelae, although, torture, survivors, have, some, of, the, highest, rates, of, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, many, are, psychologically, resilient, torture, has, been, carried, out, since, ancient, times, however, in, the, eighteenth, and, nineteenth, centuries, many, western, countries, abolished, the, official, use, of, torture, in, the, judicial, system, although, it, continued, to, be, used, throughout, the, world, public, opinion, research, shows, general, opposition, to, torture, it, is, prohibited, under, international, law, for, all, states, under, all, circumstances, and, is, explicitly, forbidden, by, several, treaties, opposition, to, torture, stimulated, the, formation, of, the, human, rights, movement, after, world, war, ii, and, it, continues, to, be, an, important, human, rights, issue, although, prevention, efforts, have, been, of, mixed, effectiveness, institutional, reforms, and, the, elimination, of, incommunicado, detention, have, had, positive, effects, despite, its, decline, torture, is, still, practiced, in, or, by, most, countries, torture, is, defined, as, the, deliberate, infliction, of, severe, pain, or, suffering, on, someone, under, the, control, of, the, perpetrator, the, treatment, must, be, inflicted, for, a, specific, purpose, such, as, punishment, and, forcing, the, victim, to, confess, or, provide, information, the, definition, put, forth, by, the, united, nations, convention, against, torture, only, considers, torture, carried, out, by, the, state, most, legal, systems, include, agents, acting, on, behalf, of, the, state, and, some, definitions, add, non, state, armed, groups, organized, crime, or, private, individuals, working, in, state, monitored, facilities, such, as, hospitals, the, most, expansive, definitions, encompass, anyone, as, a, potential, perpetrator, although, torture, is, usually, classified, as, more, severe, than, cruel, inhuman, or, degrading, treatment, cidt, the, threshold, at, which, treatment, can, be, classified, as, torture, is, the, most, controversial, aspect, of, its, definition, the, interpretation, of, torture, has, broadened, over, time, another, approach, preferred, by, scholars, such, as, manfred, nowak, and, malcolm, evans, distinguishes, torture, from, cidt, by, considering, only, the, torturer, s, purpose, and, not, the, severity, other, definitions, such, as, that, in, the, inter, american, convention, to, prevent, and, punish, torture, focus, on, the, torturer, s, aim, to, obliterate, the, personality, of, the, victim, torture, was, legally, and, morally, acceptable, in, most, ancient, medieval, and, early, modern, societies, there, is, archaeological, evidence, of, torture, in, early, neolithic, europe, about, 7, 000, years, ago, torture, is, commonly, mentioned, in, historical, sources, on, assyria, and, achaemenid, persia, societies, used, torture, both, as, part, of, the, judicial, process, and, as, punishment, although, some, historians, make, a, distinction, between, torture, and, painful, punishments, historically, torture, was, seen, as, a, reliable, way, to, elicit, the, truth, a, suitable, punishment, and, deterrence, against, future, offenses, when, torture, was, legally, regulated, there, were, restrictions, on, the, allowable, methods, common, methods, in, europe, included, the, rack, and, strappado, in, most, societies, citizens, could, be, judicially, tortured, only, under, exceptional, circumstances, and, for, a, serious, crime, such, as, treason, often, only, when, some, evidence, already, existed, in, contrast, non, citizens, such, as, foreigners, and, slaves, were, commonly, tortured, torture, was, rare, in, early, medieval, europe, but, became, more, common, between, 1200, and, 1400, because, medieval, judges, used, an, exceptionally, high, standard, of, proof, they, would, sometimes, authorize, torture, when, circumstantial, evidence, tied, a, person, to, a, capital, crime, if, there, were, fewer, than, the, two, eyewitnesses, required, to, convict, someone, in, the, absence, of, a, confession, torture, was, still, a, labor, intensive, process, reserved, for, the, most, severe, crimes, most, torture, victims, were, men, accused, of, murder, treason, or, theft, medieval, ecclesiastical, courts, and, the, inquisition, used, torture, under, the, same, procedural, rules, as, secular, courts, the, ottoman, empire, and, qajar, iran, used, torture, in, cases, where, circumstantial, evidence, tied, someone, to, a, crime, although, islamic, law, has, traditionally, considered, evidence, obtained, under, torture, to, be, inadmissible, torture, remained, legal, in, europe, during, the, seventeenth, century, but, its, practice, declined, torture, was, already, of, marginal, importance, to, european, criminal, justice, systems, by, its, formal, abolition, in, the, 18th, and, early, 19th, centuries, theories, for, why, torture, was, abolished, include, the, rise, of, enlightenment, ideas, about, the, value, of, the, human, person, the, lowering, of, the, standard, of, proof, in, criminal, cases, popular, views, that, no, longer, saw, pain, as, morally, redemptive, and, the, expansion, of, imprisonment, as, an, alternative, to, executions, or, painful, punishments, it, is, not, known, if, torture, also, declined, in, non, western, states, or, european, colonies, during, the, nineteenth, century, in, china, judicial, torture, which, had, been, practiced, for, more, than, two, millennia, was, banned, in, 1905, along, with, flogging, and, lingchi, dismemberment, as, a, means, of, execution, although, torture, in, china, continued, throughout, the, twentieth, and, twenty, first, centuries, torture, was, widely, used, by, colonial, powers, to, subdue, resistance, and, reached, a, peak, during, the, anti, colonial, wars, in, the, twentieth, century, an, estimated, 300, 000, people, were, tortured, during, the, algerian, war, of, independence, 1954, 1962, and, the, united, kingdom, and, portugal, also, used, torture, in, attempts, to, retain, their, respective, empires, independent, states, in, africa, the, middle, east, and, asia, often, used, torture, in, the, twentieth, century, but, it, is, unknown, whether, their, use, of, torture, increased, or, decreased, compared, to, nineteenth, century, levels, during, the, first, half, of, the, twentieth, century, torture, became, more, prevalent, in, europe, with, the, advent, of, secret, police, world, war, i, and, world, war, ii, and, the, rise, of, communist, and, fascist, states, torture, was, also, used, by, both, communist, and, anti, communist, governments, during, the, cold, war, in, latin, america, with, an, estimated, 100, 000, to, 150, 000, victims, of, torture, by, united, states, backed, regimes, the, only, countries, in, which, torture, was, rare, during, the, twentieth, century, were, the, liberal, democracies, of, the, west, but, torture, was, still, used, there, against, ethnic, minorities, or, criminal, suspects, from, marginalized, classes, and, during, overseas, wars, against, foreign, populations, after, the, september, 11, attacks, the, us, government, embarked, on, an, overseas, torture, program, as, part, of, its, war, on, terror, it, is, disputed, whether, torture, increases, decreases, or, remains, constant, most, countries, practice, torture, although, few, acknowledge, it, the, international, prohibition, of, torture, has, not, completely, stopped, torture, instead, states, have, changed, which, techniques, are, used, and, denied, covered, up, or, outsourced, torture, programs, measuring, the, rate, at, which, torture, occurs, is, difficult, because, it, is, typically, committed, in, secrecy, and, abuses, are, likelier, to, come, to, light, in, open, societies, where, there, is, a, commitment, to, protecting, human, rights, many, torture, survivors, especially, those, from, poor, or, marginalized, populations, are, unwilling, to, report, monitoring, has, focused, on, police, stations, and, prisons, although, torture, can, also, occur, in, other, facilities, such, as, immigration, detention, and, youth, detention, centers, torture, that, occurs, outside, of, custody, including, extrajudicial, punishment, intimidation, and, crowd, control, has, traditionally, not, been, counted, even, though, some, studies, have, suggested, it, is, more, common, than, torture, in, places, of, detention, there, is, even, less, information, on, the, prevalence, of, torture, before, the, twentieth, century, although, it, is, often, assumed, that, men, suffer, torture, at, a, higher, rate, than, women, there, is, a, lack, of, evidence, some, quantitative, research, has, estimated, that, torture, rates, are, either, stagnant, or, increasing, over, time, but, this, may, be, a, measurement, effect, although, liberal, democracies, are, less, likely, to, abuse, their, citizens, they, may, practice, torture, against, marginalized, citizens, and, non, citizens, to, whom, they, are, not, democratically, accountable, voters, may, support, violence, against, out, groups, seen, as, threatening, majoritarian, institutions, are, ineffective, at, preventing, torture, against, minorities, or, foreigners, torture, is, more, likely, when, a, society, feels, threatened, because, of, wars, or, crises, but, studies, have, not, found, a, consistent, relationship, between, the, use, of, torture, and, terrorist, attacks, torture, is, directed, against, certain, segments, of, the, population, who, are, denied, the, protection, against, torture, given, to, others, torture, of, political, prisoners, and, torture, during, armed, conflicts, receive, more, attention, compared, to, torture, of, the, poor, or, criminal, suspects, most, victims, of, torture, are, suspected, of, crimes, a, disproportionate, number, of, victims, are, from, poor, or, marginalized, communities, groups, especially, vulnerable, to, torture, include, unemployed, young, men, the, urban, poor, lgbt, people, refugees, and, migrants, ethnic, and, racial, minorities, indigenous, people, and, people, with, disabilities, relative, poverty, and, the, resulting, inequality, in, particular, leave, poor, people, vulnerable, to, torture, criminalization, of, the, poor, through, laws, targeting, homelessness, sex, work, or, working, in, the, informal, economy, can, lead, to, violent, and, arbitrary, policing, routine, violence, against, poor, and, marginalized, people, is, often, not, seen, as, torture, and, its, perpetrators, justify, the, violence, as, a, legitimate, policing, tactic, victims, lack, the, resources, or, standing, to, seek, redress, since, most, research, has, focused, on, torture, victims, less, is, known, about, the, perpetrators, of, torture, many, torturers, see, their, actions, as, serving, a, higher, political, or, ideological, goal, that, justifies, torture, as, a, legitimate, means, of, protecting, the, state, fear, is, often, the, motivation, for, torture, and, it, is, typically, not, a, rational, response, as, it, is, usually, ineffective, or, even, counterproductive, at, achieving, the, desired, aim, torture, victims, are, often, viewed, by, the, perpetrators, as, severe, threats, and, enemies, of, the, state, studies, of, perpetrators, do, not, support, the, common, assumption, that, they, are, psychologically, pathological, most, perpetrators, do, not, volunteer, to, be, torturers, many, have, an, innate, reluctance, to, employ, violence, and, rely, on, coping, mechanisms, such, as, alcohol, or, drugs, psychiatrist, pau, p, rez, sales, finds, that, torturers, act, from, a, variety, of, motives, such, as, ideological, commitment, personal, gain, group, belonging, avoiding, punishment, or, avoiding, guilt, from, previous, acts, of, torture, although, it, is, often, assumed, that, torture, is, ordered, from, above, at, the, highest, levels, of, government, sociologist, jonathan, luke, austin, argues, that, government, authorization, is, a, necessary, but, not, sufficient, condition, for, torture, to, occur, given, that, a, specific, order, to, torture, rarely, can, be, identified, in, many, cases, a, combination, of, dispositional, and, situational, effects, lead, a, person, to, become, a, torturer, in, most, cases, of, systematic, torture, the, torturers, were, desensitized, to, violence, by, being, exposed, to, physical, or, psychological, abuse, during, training, which, can, be, a, deliberate, tactic, to, create, torturers, even, when, not, explicitly, ordered, by, the, government, to, torture, perpetrators, may, feel, peer, pressure, due, to, competitive, masculinity, elite, and, specialized, police, units, are, especially, prone, to, torturing, perhaps, because, of, their, tight, knit, nature, and, insulation, from, oversight, although, some, torturers, are, formally, trained, most, are, thought, to, learn, about, torture, techniques, informally, torture, can, be, a, side, effect, of, a, broken, criminal, justice, system, in, which, underfunding, lack, of, judicial, independence, or, corruption, undermines, effective, investigations, and, fair, trials, in, this, context, people, who, cannot, afford, bribes, are, likely, to, become, victims, of, torture, understaffed, or, poorly, trained, police, are, more, likely, to, resort, to, torture, when, interrogating, suspects, in, some, countries, such, as, kyrgyzstan, suspects, are, more, likely, to, be, tortured, at, the, end, of, the, month, because, of, performance, quotas, the, contribution, of, bureaucracy, to, torture, is, under, researched, and, poorly, understood, torturers, rely, on, both, active, supporters, and, those, who, ignore, it, military, intelligence, psychology, medical, and, legal, professionals, can, all, be, complicit, in, torture, incentives, can, favor, the, use, of, torture, on, an, institutional, or, individual, level, and, some, perpetrators, are, motivated, by, the, prospect, of, career, advancement, bureaucracy, can, diffuse, responsibility, for, torture, and, help, perpetrators, excuse, their, actions, maintaining, secrecy, is, often, essential, to, maintaining, a, torture, program, which, can, be, accomplished, in, ways, ranging, from, direct, censorship, denial, or, mislabeling, torture, as, something, else, to, offshoring, abuses, to, outside, a, state, s, territory, along, with, official, denials, torture, is, enabled, by, moral, disengagement, from, the, victims, and, impunity, for, the, perpetrators, public, demand, for, decisive, action, against, crime, or, even, support, for, torture, against, criminals, can, facilitate, its, use, once, a, torture, program, is, begun, it, is, difficult, or, impossible, to, prevent, it, from, escalating, to, more, severe, techniques, and, expanding, to, larger, groups, of, victims, beyond, what, is, originally, intended, or, desired, by, decision, makers, sociologist, christopher, j, einolf, argues, that, torture, can, create, a, vicious, cycle, in, which, a, fear, of, internal, enemies, leads, to, torture, torture, creates, false, confessions, and, false, confessions, reinforce, torturers, fears, leading, to, a, spiral, of, paranoia, and, ever, increasing, torture, similar, to, a, witch, hunt, escalation, of, torture, is, especially, difficult, to, contain, in, counterinsurgency, operations, torture, and, specific, techniques, spread, between, different, countries, especially, by, soldiers, returning, home, from, overseas, wars, although, this, process, is, poorly, understood, torture, for, punishment, dates, back, to, antiquity, and, is, still, employed, in, the, twenty, first, century, a, common, practice, in, countries, with, dysfunctional, justice, systems, or, overcrowded, prisons, is, for, police, to, apprehend, suspects, torture, them, and, release, them, without, a, charge, such, torture, could, be, performed, in, a, police, station, the, victim, s, home, or, a, public, place, in, south, africa, the, police, have, been, observed, handing, suspects, over, to, vigilantes, to, be, tortured, this, type, of, extrajudicial, violence, is, often, carried, out, in, public, to, deter, others, it, discriminatorily, targets, minorities, and, marginalized, groups, and, may, be, supported, by, the, public, especially, if, people, do, not, trust, the, official, justice, system, the, classification, of, judicial, corporal, punishment, as, torture, is, internationally, controversial, although, it, is, explicitly, prohibited, under, the, geneva, conventions, some, authors, such, as, john, d, bessler, argue, that, capital, punishment, is, inherently, a, form, of, torture, carried, out, for, punishment, executions, may, be, carried, out, in, brutal, ways, such, as, stoning, death, by, burning, or, dismemberment, the, psychological, harm, of, capital, punishment, is, sometimes, considered, a, form, of, psychological, torture, others, do, not, consider, corporal, punishment, with, a, fixed, penalty, to, be, torture, as, it, does, not, seek, to, break, the, victim, s, will, torture, may, also, be, used, indiscriminately, to, terrorize, people, other, than, the, direct, victim, or, to, deter, opposition, to, the, government, in, the, united, states, torture, was, used, to, deter, slaves, from, escaping, or, rebelling, some, defenders, of, judicial, torture, prior, to, its, abolition, argued, that, it, deterred, crime, reformers, contended, that, because, torture, was, carried, out, in, secret, it, could, not, be, an, effective, deterrent, in, the, twentieth, century, well, known, examples, include, the, khmer, rouge, and, anti, communist, regimes, in, latin, america, who, tortured, and, murdered, their, victims, as, part, of, forced, disappearance, authoritarian, regimes, often, resort, to, indiscriminate, repression, because, they, cannot, accurately, identify, potential, opponents, many, insurgencies, lack, the, necessary, infrastructure, for, a, torture, program, and, instead, intimidate, by, killing, research, has, found, that, state, torture, can, extend, the, lifespan, of, terrorist, organizations, increase, incentives, for, insurgents, to, use, violence, and, radicalize, the, opposition, another, form, of, torture, for, deterrence, is, violence, against, migrants, as, has, been, reported, during, pushbacks, on, the, european, union, s, external, borders, torture, has, been, used, throughout, history, to, extract, confessions, from, detainees, in, 1764, italian, reformer, cesare, beccaria, denounced, torture, as, a, sure, way, to, acquit, robust, scoundrels, and, to, condemn, weak, but, innocent, people, similar, doubts, about, torture, s, effectiveness, had, been, voiced, for, centuries, previously, including, by, aristotle, despite, the, abolition, of, judicial, torture, it, sees, continued, use, to, elicit, confessions, especially, in, judicial, systems, placing, a, high, value, on, confessions, in, criminal, matters, the, use, of, torture, to, force, suspects, to, confess, is, facilitated, by, laws, allowing, extensive, pre, trial, detention, research, has, found, that, coercive, interrogation, is, slightly, more, effective, than, cognitive, interviewing, for, extracting, a, confession, from, a, suspect, but, presents, a, higher, risk, of, false, confession, many, torture, victims, will, say, whatever, the, torturer, wants, to, hear, to, end, the, torture, others, who, are, guilty, refuse, to, confess, especially, if, they, believe, it, would, only, bring, more, torture, or, punishment, medieval, justice, systems, attempted, to, counteract, the, risk, of, false, confession, under, torture, by, requiring, confessors, to, provide, falsifiable, details, about, the, crime, and, only, allowing, torture, if, there, was, already, some, evidence, against, the, accused, in, some, countries, political, opponents, are, tortured, to, force, them, to, confess, publicly, as, a, form, of, state, propaganda, the, use, of, torture, to, obtain, information, during, interrogation, accounts, for, a, small, percentage, of, worldwide, torture, cases, its, use, for, obtaining, confessions, or, intimidation, is, more, common, although, interrogational, torture, has, been, used, in, conventional, wars, it, is, even, more, common, in, asymmetric, war, or, civil, wars, the, ticking, time, bomb, scenario, is, extremely, rare, if, not, impossible, but, is, cited, to, justify, torture, for, interrogation, fictional, portrayals, of, torture, as, an, effective, interrogational, method, have, fueled, misconceptions, that, justify, the, use, of, torture, experiments, comparing, torture, with, other, interrogation, methods, cannot, be, performed, for, ethical, and, practical, reasons, but, most, scholars, of, torture, are, skeptical, about, its, efficacy, in, obtaining, accurate, information, although, torture, sometimes, has, obtained, actionable, intelligence, interrogational, torture, can, often, shade, into, confessional, torture, or, simply, into, entertainment, and, some, torturers, do, not, distinguish, between, interrogation, and, confession, a, wide, variety, of, techniques, have, been, used, for, torture, nevertheless, there, are, limited, ways, of, inflicting, pain, while, minimizing, the, risk, of, death, survivors, report, that, the, exact, method, used, is, not, significant, most, forms, of, torture, include, both, physical, and, psychological, elements, and, multiple, methods, are, typically, used, on, one, person, different, methods, of, torture, are, popular, in, different, countries, low, tech, methods, are, more, commonly, used, than, high, tech, ones, and, attempts, to, develop, scientifically, validated, torture, technology, have, failed, the, prohibition, of, torture, motivated, a, shift, to, methods, that, do, not, leave, marks, to, aid, in, deniability, and, to, deprive, victims, of, legal, redress, as, they, faced, more, pressure, and, scrutiny, democracies, led, the, innovation, in, clean, torture, practices, in, the, early, twentieth, century, such, techniques, diffused, worldwide, by, the, 1960s, patterns, of, torture, differ, based, on, a, torturer, s, time, limits, for, example, resulting, from, legal, limits, on, pre, trial, detention, beatings, or, blunt, trauma, are, the, most, common, form, of, physical, torture, reported, by, about, two, thirds, of, survivors, they, may, be, either, unsystematic, or, focused, on, a, specific, part, of, the, body, as, in, falanga, the, soles, of, the, feet, repeated, strikes, against, both, ears, or, shaking, the, detainee, so, that, their, head, moves, back, and, forth, often, people, are, suspended, in, painful, positions, such, as, strappado, or, upside, down, hanging, in, combination, with, beatings, people, may, also, be, subjected, to, stabbings, or, puncture, wounds, have, their, nails, removed, or, body, parts, amputated, burns, are, also, common, especially, cigarette, burns, but, other, instruments, are, also, employed, including, hot, metal, hot, fluids, the, sun, or, acid, forced, ingestion, of, water, food, or, other, substances, or, injections, are, also, used, as, torture, electric, shocks, are, often, used, to, torture, especially, to, avoid, other, methods, that, are, more, likely, to, leave, scars, asphyxiation, of, which, waterboarding, is, a, form, inflicts, torture, on, the, victim, by, cutting, off, their, air, supply, psychological, torture, includes, methods, that, involve, no, physical, element, as, well, as, forcing, a, person, to, do, something, and, physical, attacks, that, ultimately, target, the, mind, death, threats, mock, execution, or, being, forced, to, witness, the, torture, of, another, person, are, often, reported, to, be, subjectively, worse, than, being, physically, tortured, and, are, associated, with, severe, sequelae, other, torture, techniques, include, sleep, deprivation, overcrowding, or, solitary, confinement, withholding, of, food, or, water, sensory, deprivation, such, as, hooding, exposure, to, extremes, of, light, or, noise, e, g, musical, torture, humiliation, which, can, be, based, on, sexuality, or, the, victim, s, religious, or, national, identity, and, the, use, of, animals, such, as, dogs, to, frighten, or, injure, a, prisoner, positional, torture, works, by, forcing, the, person, to, adopt, a, stance, putting, their, weight, on, a, few, muscles, causing, pain, without, leaving, marks, for, example, standing, or, squatting, for, extended, periods, rape, and, sexual, assault, are, universal, torture, methods, and, frequently, instill, a, permanent, sense, of, shame, in, the, victim, and, in, some, cultures, humiliate, their, family, and, society, cultural, and, individual, differences, affect, how, the, victim, perceives, different, torture, methods, torture, is, one, of, the, most, devastating, experiences, that, a, person, can, undergo, torture, aims, to, break, the, victim, s, will, and, destroy, the, victim, s, agency, and, personality, torture, survivor, jean, am, ry, argued, that, it, was, the, most, horrible, event, a, human, being, can, retain, within, himself, and, that, whoever, was, tortured, stays, tortured, many, torture, victims, including, am, ry, later, die, by, suicide, survivors, often, experience, social, and, financial, problems, circumstances, such, as, housing, insecurity, family, separation, and, the, uncertainty, of, applying, for, asylum, in, a, safe, country, strongly, impact, survivors, well, being, death, is, not, an, uncommon, outcome, of, torture, understanding, of, the, link, between, specific, torture, methods, and, health, consequences, is, lacking, these, consequences, can, include, peripheral, neuropathy, damage, to, teeth, rhabdomyolysis, from, extensive, muscle, damage, traumatic, brain, injury, sexually, transmitted, infection, and, pregnancy, from, rape, chronic, pain, and, pain, related, disability, are, commonly, reported, but, there, is, scant, research, into, this, effect, or, possible, treatments, common, psychological, problems, affecting, survivors, include, traumatic, stress, anxiety, depression, and, sleep, disturbance, an, average, of, 40, percent, have, long, term, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, ptsd, a, higher, rate, than, for, any, other, traumatic, experience, not, all, survivors, or, rehabilitation, experts, support, using, medical, categories, to, define, their, experience, and, many, survivors, remain, psychologically, resilient, criminal, prosecutions, for, torture, are, rare, and, most, victims, who, submit, formal, complaints, are, not, believed, despite, the, efforts, for, evidence, based, evaluation, of, the, scars, from, torture, such, as, the, istanbul, protocol,
