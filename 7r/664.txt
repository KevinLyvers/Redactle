national, security, or, national, defence, national, defense, in, american, english, is, the, security, and, defence, of, a, sovereign, state, including, its, citizens, economy, and, institutions, which, is, regarded, as, a, duty, of, government, originally, conceived, as, protection, against, military, attack, national, security, is, widely, understood, to, include, also, non, military, dimensions, such, as, the, security, from, terrorism, minimization, of, crime, economic, security, energy, security, environmental, security, food, security, and, cyber, security, similarly, national, security, risks, include, in, addition, to, the, actions, of, other, nation, states, action, by, violent, non, state, actors, by, narcotic, cartels, organized, crime, by, multinational, corporations, and, also, the, effects, of, natural, disasters, governments, rely, on, a, range, of, measures, including, political, economic, and, military, power, as, well, as, diplomacy, to, safeguard, the, security, of, a, state, they, may, also, act, to, build, the, conditions, of, security, regionally, and, internationally, by, reducing, transnational, causes, of, insecurity, such, as, climate, change, economic, inequality, political, exclusion, and, nuclear, proliferation, the, concept, of, national, security, remains, ambiguous, having, evolved, from, simpler, definitions, which, emphasised, freedom, from, military, threat, and, from, political, coercion, 1, 6, 52, 54, among, the, many, definitions, proposed, to, date, are, the, following, which, show, how, the, concept, has, evolved, to, encompass, non, military, concerns, potential, causes, of, national, insecurity, include, actions, by, other, states, e, g, military, or, cyber, attack, violent, non, state, actors, e, g, terrorist, attack, organised, criminal, groups, such, as, narcotic, cartels, and, also, the, effects, of, natural, disasters, e, g, flooding, earthquakes, v, 1, 8, systemic, drivers, of, insecurity, which, may, be, transnational, include, climate, change, economic, inequality, and, marginalisation, political, exclusion, and, nuclear, proliferation, 3, in, view, of, the, wide, range, of, risks, the, security, of, a, nation, state, has, several, dimensions, including, economic, security, energy, security, physical, security, environmental, security, food, security, border, security, and, cyber, security, these, dimensions, correlate, closely, with, elements, of, national, power, increasingly, governments, organise, their, security, policies, into, a, national, security, strategy, nss, as, of, 2017, spain, sweden, the, united, kingdom, and, the, united, states, are, among, the, states, to, have, done, so, some, states, also, appoint, a, national, security, council, and, or, a, national, security, advisor, which, is, an, executive, government, agency, it, feeds, the, head, of, the, state, on, topics, concerning, national, security, and, strategic, interest, the, national, security, council, advisor, strategies, long, term, short, term, contingency, national, security, plans, india, holds, one, such, system, in, current, which, was, established, on, 19, november, 1998, although, states, differ, in, their, approach, various, forms, of, coercive, power, predominate, particularly, military, capabilities, the, scope, of, these, capabilities, has, developed, traditionally, military, capabilities, were, mainly, land, or, sea, based, and, in, smaller, countries, they, still, are, elsewhere, the, domains, of, potential, warfare, now, include, the, air, space, cyberspace, and, psychological, operations, military, capabilities, designed, for, these, domains, may, be, used, for, national, security, or, equally, for, offensive, purposes, for, example, to, conquer, and, annex, territory, and, resources, in, practice, national, security, is, associated, primarily, with, managing, physical, threats, and, with, the, military, capabilities, used, for, doing, so, that, is, national, security, is, often, understood, as, the, capacity, of, a, nation, to, mobilise, military, forces, to, guarantee, its, borders, and, to, deter, or, successfully, defend, against, physical, threats, including, military, aggression, and, attacks, by, non, state, actors, such, as, terrorism, most, states, such, as, south, africa, and, sweden, configure, their, military, forces, mainly, for, territorial, defence, others, such, as, france, russia, the, uk, and, the, us, invest, in, higher, cost, expeditionary, capabilities, which, allow, their, armed, forces, to, project, power, and, sustain, military, operations, abroad, infrastructure, security, is, the, security, provided, to, protect, infrastructure, especially, critical, infrastructure, such, as, airports, highways, rail, transport, hospitals, bridges, transport, hubs, network, communications, media, the, electricity, grid, dams, power, plants, seaports, oil, refineries, and, water, systems, infrastructure, security, seeks, to, limit, vulnerability, of, these, structures, and, systems, to, sabotage, terrorism, and, contamination, many, countries, have, established, government, agencies, to, directly, manage, the, security, of, critical, infrastructure, usually, through, the, ministry, of, interior, home, affairs, dedicated, security, agencies, to, protect, facilities, such, as, united, states, federal, protective, service, and, also, dedicated, transport, police, such, as, the, british, transport, police, there, are, also, commercial, transportation, security, units, such, as, the, amtrak, police, in, the, united, states, critical, infrastructure, is, vital, for, the, essential, functioning, of, a, country, incidental, or, deliberate, damage, can, have, a, serious, impact, on, the, economy, and, essential, services, some, of, the, threats, to, infrastructure, include, computer, security, also, known, as, cybersecurity, or, it, security, refers, to, the, security, of, computing, devices, such, as, computers, and, smartphones, as, well, as, computer, networks, such, as, private, and, public, networks, and, the, internet, it, concerns, the, protection, of, hardware, software, data, people, and, also, the, procedures, by, which, systems, are, accessed, and, the, field, has, growing, importance, due, to, the, increasing, reliance, on, computer, systems, in, most, societies, since, unauthorized, access, to, critical, civil, and, military, infrastructure, is, now, considered, a, major, threat, cyberspace, is, now, recognised, as, a, domain, of, warfare, one, such, example, is, the, use, of, stuxnet, by, the, us, and, israel, against, the, iranian, nuclear, programme, barry, buzan, ole, w, ver, jaap, de, wilde, and, others, have, argued, that, national, security, depends, on, political, security, the, stability, of, the, social, order, others, such, as, paul, rogers, have, added, that, the, equitability, of, the, international, order, is, equally, vital, hence, political, security, depends, on, the, rule, of, international, law, including, the, laws, of, war, the, effectiveness, of, international, political, institutions, as, well, as, diplomacy, and, negotiation, between, nations, and, other, security, actors, it, also, depends, on, among, other, factors, effective, political, inclusion, of, disaffected, groups, and, the, human, security, of, the, citizenry, economic, security, in, the, context, of, international, relations, is, the, ability, of, a, nation, state, to, maintain, and, develop, the, national, economy, without, which, other, dimensions, of, national, security, cannot, be, managed, economic, capability, largely, determines, the, defence, capability, of, a, nation, and, thus, a, sound, economic, security, directly, influences, the, national, security, of, a, nation, that, is, why, we, see, countries, with, sound, economy, happen, to, have, sound, security, setup, too, such, as, the, united, states, china, india, among, others, in, larger, countries, strategies, for, economic, security, expect, to, access, resources, and, markets, in, other, countries, and, to, protect, their, own, markets, at, home, developing, countries, may, be, less, secure, than, economically, advanced, states, due, to, high, rates, of, unemployment, and, underpaid, work, environmental, security, also, known, as, ecological, security, refers, to, the, integrity, of, ecosystems, and, the, biosphere, particularly, in, relation, to, their, capacity, to, sustain, a, diversity, of, life, forms, including, human, life, the, security, of, ecosystems, has, attracted, greater, attention, as, the, impact, of, ecological, damage, by, humans, has, grown, the, degradation, of, ecosystems, including, topsoil, erosion, deforestation, biodiversity, loss, and, climate, change, affect, economic, security, and, can, precipitate, mass, migration, leading, to, increased, pressure, on, resources, elsewhere, ecological, security, is, also, important, since, most, of, the, countries, in, the, world, are, developing, and, dependent, on, agriculture, and, agriculture, gets, affected, largely, due, to, climate, change, this, effect, affects, the, economy, of, the, nation, which, in, turn, affects, national, security, the, scope, and, nature, of, environmental, threats, to, national, security, and, strategies, to, engage, them, are, a, subject, of, debate, 29, 33, romm, 1993, classifies, the, major, impacts, of, ecological, changes, on, national, security, as, 15, resources, include, water, sources, of, energy, land, and, minerals, availability, of, adequate, natural, resources, is, important, for, a, nation, to, develop, its, industry, and, economic, power, for, example, in, the, persian, gulf, war, of, 1991, iraq, captured, kuwait, partly, in, order, to, secure, access, to, its, oil, wells, and, one, reason, for, the, us, counter, invasion, was, the, value, of, the, same, wells, to, its, own, economy, water, resources, are, subject, to, disputes, between, many, nations, including, india, and, pakistan, and, in, the, middle, east, the, interrelations, between, security, energy, natural, resources, and, their, sustainability, is, increasingly, acknowledged, in, national, security, strategies, and, resource, security, is, now, included, among, the, un, sustainable, development, goals, in, the, us, for, example, the, military, has, installed, solar, photovoltaic, microgrids, on, their, bases, in, case, of, power, outage, the, dimensions, of, national, security, outlined, above, are, frequently, in, tension, with, one, another, for, example, if, tensions, such, as, these, are, mismanaged, national, security, policies, and, actions, may, be, ineffective, or, counterproductive, increasingly, national, security, strategies, have, begun, to, recognise, that, nations, cannot, provide, for, their, own, security, without, also, developing, the, security, of, their, regional, and, international, context, for, example, sweden, s, national, security, strategy, of, 2017, declared, wider, security, measures, must, also, now, encompass, protection, against, epidemics, and, infectious, diseases, combating, terrorism, and, organised, crime, ensuring, safe, transport, and, reliable, food, supplies, protecting, against, energy, supply, interruptions, countering, devastating, climate, change, initiatives, for, peace, and, global, development, and, much, more, the, extent, to, which, this, matters, and, how, it, should, be, done, is, the, subject, of, debate, some, argue, that, the, principal, beneficiary, of, national, security, policy, should, be, the, nation, state, itself, which, should, centre, its, strategy, on, protective, and, coercive, capabilities, in, order, to, safeguard, itself, in, a, hostile, environment, and, potentially, to, project, that, power, into, its, environment, and, dominate, it, to, the, point, of, strategic, supremacy, others, argue, that, security, depends, principally, on, building, the, conditions, in, which, equitable, relationships, between, nations, can, develop, partly, by, reducing, antagonism, between, actors, ensuring, that, fundamental, needs, can, be, met, and, also, that, differences, of, interest, can, be, negotiated, effectively, in, the, uk, for, example, malcolm, chalmers, argued, in, 2015, that, the, heart, of, the, uk, s, approach, should, be, support, for, the, western, strategic, military, alliance, led, through, nato, by, the, united, states, as, the, key, anchor, around, which, international, order, is, maintained, approaches, to, national, security, can, have, a, complex, impact, on, human, rights, and, civil, liberties, for, example, the, rights, and, liberties, of, citizens, are, affected, by, the, use, of, military, personnel, and, militarised, police, forces, to, control, public, behaviour, the, use, of, surveillance, including, mass, surveillance, in, cyberspace, which, has, implications, for, privacy, military, recruitment, and, conscription, practices, and, the, effects, of, warfare, on, civilians, and, civil, infrastructure, this, has, led, to, a, dialectical, struggle, particularly, in, liberal, democracies, between, government, authority, and, the, rights, and, freedoms, of, the, general, public, even, where, the, exercise, of, national, security, is, subject, to, good, governance, and, the, rule, of, law, a, risk, remains, that, the, term, national, security, may, become, a, pretext, for, suppressing, unfavorable, political, and, social, views, in, the, us, for, example, the, controversial, usa, patriot, act, of, 2001, and, the, revelation, by, edward, snowden, in, 2013, that, the, national, security, agency, harvests, the, personal, data, of, the, general, public, brought, these, issues, to, wide, public, attention, among, the, questions, raised, are, whether, and, how, national, security, considerations, at, times, of, war, should, lead, to, the, suppression, of, individual, rights, and, freedoms, and, whether, such, restrictions, are, necessary, when, a, state, is, at, peace, national, security, ideology, as, taught, by, the, us, army, school, of, the, americas, to, military, personnel, was, vital, in, causing, the, military, coup, of, 1964, in, brazil, and, the, 1976, one, in, argentina, the, military, dictatorships, were, installed, on, the, claim, by, the, military, that, leftists, were, an, existential, threat, to, the, national, interests, china, s, military, is, the, people, s, liberation,

of, the, state, through, effective, measures, against, enemy, agents, spies, and, counterrevolutionary, activities, designed, to, sabotage, or, overthrow, china, s, socialist, system, for, schengen, area, some, parts, of, national, security, and, external, border, control, are, enforced, by, frontex, according, to, the, treaty, of, lisbon, the, security, policy, of, the, european, union, is, set, by, high, representative, of, the, union, for, foreign, affairs, and, security, policy, and, assisted, by, european, external, action, service, europol, is, one, of, the, agencies, of, the, european,

geopolitical, interests, while, islamic, upsurge, in, indian, state, of, jammu, and, kashmir, demanding, secession, and, far, left, wing, terrorism, in, india, s, red, corridor, remain, some, key,

national, security, became, an, official, guiding, principle, of, foreign, policy, in, the, united, states, when, the, national, security, act, of, 1947, was, signed, on, july, 26, 1947, by, u, s, president, harry, s, truman, 3, as, amended, in, 1949, this, act, notably, the, act, did, not, define, national, security, which, was, conceivably, advantageous, as, its, ambiguity, made, it, a, powerful, phrase, to, invoke, against, diverse, threats, to, interests, of, the, state, such, as, domestic, concerns, 3, 5, the, notion, that, national, security, encompasses, more, than, just, military, security, was, present, though, understated, from, the, beginning, the, act, established, the, national, security, council, so, as, to, advise, the, president, on, the, integration, of,

emphasis, added, in, gen, maxwell, taylor, s, 1974, essay, the, legitimate, claims, of, national, security, taylor, states, the, national, valuables, in, this, broad, sense, include, current, assets, and, national, interests, as, well, as, the, sources, of, strength, upon, which, our, future, as, a, nation, depends, some, valuables, are, tangible, and, earthy, others, are, spiritual, or, intellectual, they, range, widely, from, political, assets, such, as, the, bill, of, rights, our, political, institutions, and, international, friendships, to, many, economic, assets, which, radiate, worldwide, from, a, highly, productive, domestic, economy, supported, by, rich, natural, resources, it, is, the, urgent, need, to, protect, valuables, such, as, these, which, legitimizes, and, makes, essential, the, role, of, national, security, to, address, the, institutionalisation, of, new, bureaucracies, and, government, practices, in, the, post, world, war, ii, period, in, the, u, s, the,

by, 1945, it, had, become, rapidly, vulnerable, with, the, advent, of, long, range, bombers, atom, bombs, and, ballistic, missiles, a, general, perception, grew, that, future, mobilization, would, be, insufficient, and, that, preparation, must, be, constant, for, the, first, time, american, leaders, dealt, with, the, essential, paradox, of, national, security, faced, by, the, roman, empire, and, subsequent, great, powers, si, vis, pacem, para, bellum, if, you, want, peace, prepare, for, war, the, u, s, joint, chiefs, of, staff, defines, national, security, of, the, united, states, in, the, following, manner, a, collective, term, encompassing, both, national, defense, and, foreign, relations, of, the, united, states, specifically, the, condition, provided, by, a, a, military, or, defense, advantage, over, any, foreign, nation, or, group, of, nations, b, a, favorable, foreign, relations, position, or, c, a, defense, posture, capable, of, successfully, resisting, hostile, or, destructive, action, from, within, or, without, overt, or, covert, in, 2010, the, white, house, included, an, all, encompassing, world, view, in, a, national, security, strategy, which, identified, security, as, one, of, the, country, s, four, enduring, national, interests, that, were, inexorably, intertwined, to, achieve, the, world, we, seek, the, united, states, must, apply, our, strategic, approach, in, pursuit, of, four, enduring, national, interests, each, of, these, interests, is, inextricably, linked, to, the, others, no, single, interest, can, be, pursued, in, isolation, but, at, the, same, time, positive, action, in, one, area, will, help, advance, all, four, u, s, secretary, of, state, hillary, clinton, has, said, that, the, countries, that, threaten, regional, and, global, peace, are, the, very, places, where, women, and, girls, are, deprived, of, dignity, and, opportunity, she, has, noted, that, countries, where, women, are, oppressed, are, places, where, the, rule, of, law, and, democracy, are, struggling, to, take, root, and, that, when, women, s, rights, as, equals, in, society, are, upheld, the, society, as, a, whole, changes, and, improves, which, in, turn, enhances, stability, in, that, society, which, in, turn, contributes, to, global, society, the, bush, administration, in, january, 2008, initiated, the, comprehensive, national, cybersecurity, initiative, cnci, it, introduced, a, differentiated, approach, such, as, identifying, existing, and, emerging, cybersecurity, threats, finding, and, plugging, existing, cyber, vulnerabilities, and, apprehending, those, trying, to, access, federal, information, systems, president, obama, said, the, cyber, threat, is, one, of, the, most, serious, economic, and, national, security, challenges, we, face, as, a, nation, and, that, america, s, economic, prosperity, in, the, 21st, century, will, depend, on, cybersecurity
