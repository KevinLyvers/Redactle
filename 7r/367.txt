the, kartvelian, languages, k, r, t, v, l, i, n, v, i, l, kart, vel, ee, n, veel, georgian, romanized, kartveluri, enebi, also, known, as, south, caucasian, kartvelic, and, iberian, languages, are, a, language, family, indigenous, to, the, south, caucasus, and, spoken, primarily, in, georgia, there, are, approximately, 5, million, georgian, language, speakers, worldwide, with, large, groups, in, russia, iran, the, united, states, the, european, union, israel, and, northeastern, turkey, the, kartvelian, family, has, no, known, relation, to, any, other, language, family, making, it, one, of, the, world, s, primary, language, families, the, most, widely, spoken, of, these, languages, is, georgian, the, earliest, literary, source, in, any, kartvelian, language, is, the, old, georgian, bir, el, qutt, inscriptions, written, in, ancient, georgian, asomtavruli, script, at, the, once, existing, georgian, monastery, near, bethlehem, dated, to, c, 430, ad, georgian, scripts, are, used, to, write, all, kartvelian, languages, georgian, is, the, official, language, of, georgia, spoken, by, 90, of, the, population, and, serves, as, its, main, language, for, literary, and, business, use, it, is, written, with, an, original, and, distinctive, alphabet, and, the, oldest, surviving, literary, text, dates, from, the, 5th, century, ad, the, old, georgian, script, seems, to, have, been, derived, from, the, greek, script, but, this, is, not, certain, mingrelian, has, been, written, with, the, georgian, alphabet, since, 1864, especially, in, the, period, from, 1930, to, 1938, when, the, mingrelians, enjoyed, some, cultural, autonomy, and, after, 1989, the, laz, language, was, written, mainly, between, 1927, and, 1937, and, now, again, in, turkey, using, the, latin, alphabet, laz, however, is, disappearing, as, its, speakers, are, integrating, into, mainstream, turkish, society, the, kartvelian, language, family, consists, of, four, closely, related, languages, the, connection, between, these, languages, was, first, reported, in, linguistic, literature, by, johann, anton, g, ldenst, dt, in, his, 1773, classification, of, the, languages, of, the, caucasus, and, later, proven, by, g, rosen, marie, f, licit, brosset, franz, bopp, and, others, during, the, 1840s, zan, is, the, branch, that, contains, the, mingrelian, and, laz, languages, on, the, basis, of, glottochronological, analysis, georgi, klimov, dates, the, split, of, the, proto, kartvelian, into, svan, and, proto, georgian, zan, proto, karto, zan, to, the, 19th, century, bc, and, the, further, division, into, georgian, and, zan, to, the, 8th, century, bc, although, with, the, reservation, that, such, dating, is, very, preliminary, and, substantial, further, study, is, required, a, 2023, study, employing, bayesian, linguistic, phylogenetics, in, conjunction, with, archaeological, ethnoecological, and, human, population, genetic, data, suggests, a, substantially, earlier, separation, between, svan, and, the, karto, zan, languages, this, multidisciplinary, approach, dates, the, divergence, to, the, early, copper, age, approximately, 7600, years, before, present, according, to, this, study, it, is, highly, likely, that, proto, karto, zan, i, e, proto, georgian, zan, prior, to, its, split, into, georgian, and, zan, was, spoken, by, pre, kura, araxes, and, kura, araxes, farmers, that, thrived, in, the, watershed, of, mtkvari, kura, river, during, the, copper, and, bronze, ages, no, relationship, with, other, languages, including, northwest, caucasian, and, or, northeast, caucasian, has, been, demonstrated, so, far, there, have, been, numerous, attempts, to, link, kartvelian, languages, to, other, language, families, such, as, the, proposed, nostratic, family, but, these, have, fallen, out, of, favor, certain, grammatical, similarities, with, basque, especially, in, the, case, system, have, often, been, pointed, out, however, the, hypothesis, of, a, relationship, which, also, tends, to, link, the, caucasian, languages, with, other, non, indo, european, and, non, semitic, languages, of, the, near, east, of, ancient, times, is, generally, considered, to, lack, conclusive, evidence, any, similarities, to, other, linguistic, phyla, may, be, due, to, areal, influences, heavy, borrowing, in, both, directions, i, e, from, north, caucasian, to, kartvelian, and, vice, versa, has, been, observed, therefore, it, is, likely, that, certain, grammatical, features, have, been, influenced, as, well, the, kartvelian, languages, have, grammatical, gender, based, on, animacy, classifying, objects, as, intelligent, who, class, and, unintelligent, what, class, beings, kartvelian, verbs, can, indicate, one, two, or, three, grammatical, persons, a, performer, of, an, action, is, called, the, subject, and, affected, persons, are, objects, direct, or, indirect, the, person, may, be, singular, or, plural, according, to, the, number, of, persons, the, verbs, are, classified, as, unipersonal, bipersonal, or, tripersonal, subjects, and, objects, are, indicated, with, special, affixes, l, d, incl, gv, incl, gw, incl, by, means, of, special, markers, kartvelian, verbs, can, indicate, four, kinds, of, action, intentionality, version, subject, direct, object, and, indirect, object, are, coded, by, the, three, core, cases, namely, ergative, nominative, and, dative, although, the, term, ergative, is, traditional, strictly, speaking, no, kartvelian, language, features, ergative, alignment, rather, they, display, a, mixture, of, nominative, accusative, and, active, alignment, depending, on, two, factors, georgian, and, svan, have, accusative, alignment, in, the, present, series, often, termed, series, i, and, active, alignment, in, the, aorist, series, series, ii, laz, has, extended, the, case, marking, of, series, ii, to, series, i, thus, featuring, active, alignment, regardless, of, tense, mingrelian, on, the, other, hand, has, extended, the, use, of, the, ergative, to, all, intransitive, verbs, becoming, fully, accusative, in, all, series, although, with, different, case, marking, form, ni, gwey, incl
