they, re, both, blamed, for, predisposing, their, members, to, violent, acts, but, they, ve, sparked, radically, different, public, policy, responses, activists, have, also, made, the, link, between, a, perceived, increase, in, gang, activity, and, the, sharp, rise, in, us, police, budgets, while, pointing, out, rampant, corruption, in, police, gang, units, such, as, the, rampart, scandal, in, the, los, angeles, police, department, in, the, uk, context, law, enforcement, agencies, are, increasingly, focusing, enforcement, efforts, on, gangs, and, gang, membership, debate, persists, over, the, extent, and, nature, of, gang, activity, in, the, uk, with, some, academics, and, policy, makers, arguing, that, the, current, focus, is, inadvisable, given, a, lack, of, consensus, over, the, relationship, between, gangs, and, crime, the, runnymede, trust, suggests, despite, the, well, rehearsed, public, discourse, around, youth, gangs, and, gang, culture, we, actually, know, very, little, about, gangs, in, the, uk, about, how, a, gang, might, be, defined, or, understood, about, what, being, in, a, gang, means, we, know, still, less, about, how, the, gang, links, to, levels, of, youth,
