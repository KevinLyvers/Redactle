reading, is, the, process, of, taking, in, the, sense, or, meaning, of, symbols, often, specifically, those, of, a, written, language, by, means, of, sight, or, touch, for, educators, and, researchers, reading, is, a, multifaceted, process, involving, such, areas, as, word, recognition, orthography, spelling, alphabetics, phonics, phonemic, awareness, vocabulary, comprehension, fluency, and, motivation, other, types, of, reading, and, writing, such, as, pictograms, e, g, a, hazard, symbol, and, an, emoji, are, not, based, on, speech, based, writing, systems, the, common, link, is, the, interpretation, of, symbols, to, extract, the, meaning, from, the, visual, notations, or, tactile, signals, as, in, the, case, of, braille, reading, is, generally, an, individual, activity, done, silently, although, on, occasion, a, person, reads, out, loud, for, other, listeners, or, reads, aloud, for, one, s, own, use, for, better, comprehension, before, the, reintroduction, of, separated, text, spaces, between, words, in, the, late, middle, ages, the, ability, to, read, silently, was, considered, rather, remarkable, major, predictors, of, an, individual, s, ability, to, read, both, alphabetic, and, non, alphabetic, scripts, are, oral, language, skills, phonological, awareness, rapid, automatized, naming, and, verbal, iq, as, a, leisure, activity, children, and, adults, read, because, it, is, enjoyable, and, interesting, in, the, us, about, half, of, all, adults, read, one, or, more, books, for, pleasure, each, year, about, 5, read, more, than, 50, books, per, year, americans, read, more, if, they, have, more, education, read, fluently, and, easily, are, female, live, in, cities, and, have, higher, socioeconomic, status, children, become, better, readers, when, they, know, more, about, the, world, in, general, and, when, they, perceive, reading, as, fun, rather, than, as, a, chore, to, be, performed, reading, is, an, essential, part, of, literacy, yet, from, a, historical, perspective, literacy, is, about, having, the, ability, to, both, read, and, write, since, the, 1990s, some, organizations, have, defined, literacy, in, a, wide, variety, of, ways, that, may, go, beyond, the, traditional, ability, to, read, and, write, the, following, are, some, examples, in, the, academic, field, some, view, literacy, in, a, more, philosophical, manner, and, propose, the, concept, of, multiliteracies, for, example, they, say, this, huge, shift, from, traditional, print, based, literacy, to, 21st, century, multiliteracies, reflects, the, impact, of, communication, technologies, and, multimedia, on, the, evolving, nature, of, texts, as, well, as, the, skills, and, dispositions, associated, with, the, consumption, production, evaluation, and, distribution, of, those, texts, borsheim, meritt, reed, 2008, p, 87, according, to, cognitive, neuroscientist, mark, seidenberg, these, multiple, literacies, have, allowed, educators, to, change, the, topic, from, reading, and, writing, to, literacy, he, goes, on, to, say, that, some, educators, when, faced, with, criticisms, of, how, reading, is, taught, didn, t, alter, their, practices, they, changed, the, subject, also, some, organizations, might, include, numeracy, skills, and, technology, skills, separately, but, alongside, of, literacy, skills, in, addition, since, the, 1940s, the, term, literacy, is, often, used, to, mean, having, knowledge, or, skill, in, a, particular, field, e, g, computer, literacy, ecological, literacy, health, literacy, media, literacy, quantitative, literacy, numeracy, and, visual, literacy, in, order, to, understand, a, text, it, is, usually, necessary, to, understand, the, spoken, language, associated, with, that, text, in, this, way, writing, systems, are, distinguished, from, many, other, symbolic, communication, systems, once, established, writing, systems, on, the, whole, change, more, slowly, than, their, spoken, counterparts, and, often, preserve, features, and, expressions, which, are, no, longer, current, in, the, spoken, language, the, great, benefit, of, writing, systems, is, their, ability, to, maintain, a, persistent, record, of, information, expressed, in, a, language, which, can, be, retrieved, independently, of, the, initial, act, of, formulation, reading, for, pleasure, has, been, linked, to, increased, cognitive, progress, in, vocabulary, and, mathematics, during, adolescence, sustained, high, volume, lifetime, reading, has, been, associated, with, high, levels, of, academic, attainment, research, suggests, that, reading, can, improve, stress, management, memory, focus, writing, skills, and, imagination, the, cognitive, benefits, of, reading, continue, into, mid, life, and, the, senior, years, research, suggests, that, reading, books, and, writing, are, among, the, brain, stimulating, activities, that, can, slow, down, cognitive, decline, in, seniors, reading, has, been, the, subject, of, considerable, research, and, reporting, for, decades, many, organizations, measure, and, report, on, reading, achievement, for, children, and, adults, e, g, naep, pirls, pisa, piaac, and, eqao, researchers, have, concluded, that, approximately, 95, of, students, can, be, taught, to, read, by, the, end, of, the, first, or, second, year, of, school, yet, in, many, countries, 20, or, more, do, not, meet, that, expectation, a, 2012, study, in, the, u, s, found, that, 33, of, grade, three, children, had, low, reading, scores, however, they, comprised, 63, of, the, children, who, did, not, graduate, from, high, school, poverty, also, had, an, additional, negative, impact, on, high, school, graduation, rates, according, to, the, 2019, nation, s, report, card, 34, of, grade, four, students, in, the, united, states, failed, to, perform, at, or, above, the, basic, reading, level, there, was, a, significant, difference, by, race, and, ethnicity, e, g, black, students, at, 52, and, white, students, at, 23, after, the, impact, of, the, covid, 19, pandemic, the, average, basic, reading, score, dropped, by, 3, in, 2022, see, more, about, the, breakdown, by, ethnicity, in, 2019, and, 2022, here, in, 2022, 30, of, grade, eight, students, failed, to, perform, at, or, above, the, naep, basic, level, which, was, 3, points, lower, compared, to, 2019, according, to, a, 2023, study, in, california, only, 46, 6, of, grade, three, students, achieved, the, english, reading, standards, another, report, states, that, many, teenagers, who, ve, spent, time, in, california, s, juvenile, detention, facilities, get, high, school, diplomas, with, grade, school, reading, skills, there, are, kids, getting, their, high, school, diplomas, who, aren, t, able, to, even, read, and, write, during, a, five, year, span, beginning, in, 2018, 85, of, these, students, who, graduated, from, high, school, did, not, pass, a, 12th, grade, reading, assessment, between, 2013, and, 2024, 37, us, states, passed, laws, or, implemented, new, policies, related, to, evidence, based, reading, instruction, in, 2023, new, york, city, set, about, to, require, schools, to, teach, reading, with, an, emphasis, on, phonics, in, that, city, less, than, half, of, the, students, from, the, third, grade, to, the, eighth, grade, of, school, scored, as, proficient, on, state, reading, exams, more, than, 63, of, black, and, hispanic, test, takers, did, not, make, the, grade, globally, the, covid, 19, pandemic, created, a, substantial, overall, learning, deficit, in, reading, abilities, and, other, academic, areas, it, arose, early, in, the, pandemic, and, persists, over, time, and, is, particularly, large, among, children, from, low, socio, economic, backgrounds, in, the, us, several, research, studies, show, that, in, the, absence, of, additional, support, there, is, nearly, a, 90, percent, chance, that, a, poor, reader, in, grade, 1, will, remain, a, poor, reader, in, canada, the, province, of, ontario, reported, that, 27, of, grade, three, students, did, not, meet, the, provincial, reading, standards, in, 2023, also, in, ontario, 53, of, grade, three, students, with, special, education, needs, students, who, have, an, individual, education, plan, were, not, meeting, the, provincial, standards, in, 2022, the, province, of, nova, scotia, reported, that, 32, of, grade, three, students, did, not, meet, the, provincial, reading, standards, in, 2022, the, province, of, new, brunswick, reported, that, 43, 4, and, 30, 7, did, not, meet, the, reading, comprehension, achievement, levels, for, grades, four, and, six, respectively, in, 2023, the, progress, in, international, reading, literacy, study, pirls, publishes, reading, achievement, for, fourth, graders, in, 50, countries, the, five, countries, with, the, highest, overall, reading, average, are, the, russian, federation, singapore, hong, kong, sar, ireland, and, finland, some, others, are, england, 10th, united, states, 15th, australia, 21st, canada, 23rd, and, new, zealand, 33rd, the, programme, for, international, student, assessment, pisa, measures, 15, year, old, school, pupils, scholastic, performance, on, mathematics, science, and, reading, critics, however, say, pisa, is, fundamentally, flawed, in, its, underlying, view, of, education, its, implementation, and, its, interpretation, and, impact, on, education, globally, the, reading, levels, of, adults, ages, 16, 65, in, 39, countries, are, reported, by, the, programme, for, the, international, assessment, of, adult, competencies, piaac, between, 2011, and, 2018, piaac, reports, the, percentage, of, adults, reading, at, or, below, level, one, the, lowest, of, five, levels, some, examples, are, japan, 4, 9, finland, 10, 6, netherlands, 11, 7, australia, 12, 6, sweden, 13, 3, canada, 16, 4, england, uk, 16, 4, and, the, united, states, 16, 9, according, to, the, world, bank, 53, of, all, children, in, low, and, middle, income, countries, suffer, from, learning, poverty, in, 2019, using, data, from, the, unesco, institute, for, statistics, they, published, a, report, entitled, ending, learning, poverty, what, will, it, take, learning, poverty, is, defined, as, being, unable, to, read, and, understand, a, simple, text, by, age, 10, although, they, say, that, all, foundational, skills, are, important, include, reading, numeracy, basic, reasoning, ability, socio, emotional, skills, and, others, they, focus, specifically, on, reading, their, reasoning, is, that, reading, proficiency, is, an, easily, understood, metric, of, learning, reading, is, a, student, s, gateway, to, learning, in, every, other, area, and, reading, proficiency, can, serve, as, a, proxy, for, foundational, learning, in, other, subjects, they, suggest, five, pillars, to, reduce, learning, poverty, learning, to, read, or, reading, skills, acquisition, is, the, acquisition, and, practice, of, the, skills, necessary, to, understand, the, meaning, behind, printed, words, for, a, skilled, reader, the, act, of, reading, feels, simple, effortless, and, automatic, however, the, process, of, learning, to, read, is, complex, and, builds, on, cognitive, linguistic, and, social, skills, developed, from, a, very, early, age, as, one, of, the, four, core, language, skills, listening, speaking, reading, and, writing, reading, is, vital, to, gaining, a, command, of, written, language, in, the, united, states, and, elsewhere, it, is, widely, believed, that, students, who, lack, proficiency, in, reading, by, the, end, of, grade, three, may, face, obstacles, for, the, rest, of, their, academic, career, for, example, it, is, estimated, that, they, would, not, be, able, to, read, half, of, the, material, they, will, encounter, in, grade, four, in, 2019, among, american, fourth, graders, in, public, schools, only, 58, of, asian, 45, of, caucasian, 23, of, hispanic, and, 18, of, black, students, performed, at, or, above, the, proficient, level, of, the, nation, s, report, card, also, in, 2012, in, the, united, kingdom, it, has, been, reported, that, 15, year, old, students, are, reading, at, the, level, expected, of, 12, year, old, students, as, a, result, many, governments, put, practices, in, place, to, ensure, that, students, are, reading, at, grade, level, by, the, end, of, grade, three, an, example, of, this, is, the, third, grade, reading, guarantee, created, by, the, state, of, ohio, in, 2017, this, is, a, program, to, identify, students, from, kindergarten, through, grade, three, that, are, behind, in, reading, and, provide, support, to, make, sure, they, are, on, track, for, reading, success, by, the, end, of, grade, three, this, is, also, known, as, remedial, education, another, example, is, the, policy, in, england, whereby, any, pupil, who, is, struggling, to, decode, words, properly, by, year, three, must, urgently, receive, help, through, a, rigorous, and, systematic, phonics, programme, in, 2016, out, of, 50, countries, the, united, states, achieved, the, 15th, highest, score, in, grade, four, reading, ability, the, ten, countries, with, the, highest, overall, reading, average, are, the, russian, federation, singapore, hong, kong, sar, ireland, finland, poland, northern, ireland, norway, chinese, taipei, and, england, uk, some, others, are, australia, 21st, canada, 23rd, new, zealand, 33rd, france, 34th, saudi, arabia, 44th, and, south, africa, 50th, spoken, language, is, the, foundation, of, learning, to, read, long, before, children, see, any, letters, and, children, s, knowledge, of, the, phonological, structure, of, language, is, a, good, predictor, of, early, reading, ability, spoken, language, is, dominant, for, most, of, childhood, however, reading, ultimately, catches, up, and, surpasses, speech, by, their, first, birthday, most, children, have, learned, all, the, sounds, in, their, spoken, language, however, it, takes, longer, for, them, to, learn, the, phonological, form, of, words, and, to, begin, developing, a, spoken, vocabulary, children, acquire, a, spoken, language, in, a, few, years, five, to, six, year, old, english, learners, have, vocabularies, of, 2, 500, to, 5, 000, words, and, add, 5, 000, words, per, year, for, the, first, several, years, of, schooling, this, rapid, learning, rate, cannot, be, accounted, for, by, the, instruction, they, receive, instead, children, learn, that, the, meaning, of, a, new, word, can, be, inferred, because, it, occurs, in, the, same, context, as, familiar, words, e, g, lion, is, often, seen, with, cowardly, and, king, as, british, linguist, john, rupert, firth, says, you, shall, know, a, word, by, the, company, it, keeps, the, environment, in, which, children, live, may, also, impact, their, ability, to, acquire, reading, skills, children, who, are, regularly, exposed, to, chronic, environmental, noise, pollution, such, as, highway, traffic, noise, have, been, known, to, show, decreased, ability, to, discriminate, between, phonemes, oral, language, sounds, as, well, as, lower, reading, scores, on, standardized, tests, children, learn, to, speak, naturally, by, listening, to, other, people, speak, however, reading, is, not, a, natural, process, and, many, children, need, to, learn, to, read, through, a, process, that, involves, systematic, guidance, and, feedback, so, reading, to, children, is, not, the, same, as, teaching, children, to, read, nonetheless, reading, to, children, is, important, because, it, socializes, them, to, the, activity, of, reading, it, engages, them, it, expands, their, knowledge, of, spoken, language, and, it, enriches, their, linguistic, ability, by, hearing, new, and, novel, words, and, grammatical, structures, however, there, is, some, evidence, that, shared, reading, with, children, does, help, to, improve, reading, if, the, children, s, attention, is, directed, to, the, words, on, the, page, as, they, are, being, read, to, there, is, some, debate, as, to, the, optimum, age, to, teach, children, to, read, the, common, core, state, standards, initiative, ccss, in, the, united, states, has, standards, for, foundational, reading, skills, in, kindergarten, and, grade, one, that, include, instruction, in, print, concepts, phonological, awareness, phonics, word, recognition, and, fluency, however, some, critics, of, ccss, say, that, to, achieve, reading, standards, usually, calls, for, long, hours, of, drill, and, worksheets, and, reduces, other, vital, areas, of, learning, such, as, math, science, social, studies, art, music, and, creative, play, the, pisa, 2007, oecd, data, from, 54, countries, demonstrates, no, association, between, school, entry, age, and, reading, achievement, at, age, 15, also, a, german, study, of, 50, kindergartens, compared, children, who, at, age, 5, had, spent, a, year, either, academically, focused, or, play, arts, focused, and, found, that, in, time, the, two, groups, became, inseparable, in, reading, skill, the, authors, conclude, that, the, effects, of, early, reading, are, like, watering, a, garden, before, a, rainstorm, the, earlier, watering, is, rendered, undetectable, by, the, rainstorm, the, watering, wastes, precious, water, and, the, watering, detracts, the, gardener, from, other, important, preparatory, groundwork, some, scholars, favor, a, developmentally, appropriate, practice, dpa, in, which, formal, instruction, on, reading, begins, when, children, are, about, six, or, seven, years, old, and, to, support, that, theory, some, point, out, that, children, in, finland, start, school, at, age, seven, finland, ranked, 5th, in, the, 2016, pirls, international, grade, four, reading, achievement, in, a, discussion, on, academic, kindergartens, professor, of, child, development, david, elkind, has, argued, that, since, there, is, no, solid, research, demonstrating, that, early, academic, training, is, superior, to, or, worse, than, the, more, traditional, hands, on, model, of, early, education, educators, should, defer, to, developmental, approaches, that, provide, young, children, with, ample, time, and, opportunity, to, explore, the, natural, world, on, their, own, terms, elkind, emphasized, the, principle, that, early, education, must, start, with, the, child, not, with, the, subject, matter, to, be, taught, in, response, grover, j, whitehurst, director, brown, center, on, education, policy, part, of, brookings, institution, said, david, elkind, is, relying, too, much, on, philosophies, of, education, rather, than, science, and, research, he, continues, to, say, education, practices, are, doomed, to, cycles, of, fad, and, fancy, until, they, become, more, based, on, evidence, based, practice, on, the, subject, of, finland, s, academic, results, as, some, researchers, point, out, prior, to, starting, school, finnish, children, must, participate, in, one, year, of, compulsory, free, pre, primary, education, and, most, are, reading, before, they, start, school, and, with, respect, to, developmentally, appropriate, practice, dpa, in, 2019, the, national, association, for, the, education, of, young, children, washington, d, c, released, a, draft, position, paper, on, dpa, saying, the, notion, that, young, children, are, not, ready, for, academic, subject, matter, is, a, misunderstanding, of, developmentally, appropriate, practice, particularly, in, grades, 1, through, 3, almost, all, subject, matter, can, be, taught, in, ways, that, are, meaningful, and, engaging, for, each, child, and, researchers, at, the, institutes, for, the, achievement, of, human, potential, say, it, is, a, myth, that, early, readers, are, bored, or, become, trouble, makers, in, school, other, researchers, and, educators, favor, limited, amounts, of, literacy, instruction, at, the, age, of, four, and, five, in, addition, to, non, academic, intellectually, stimulating, activities, reviews, of, the, academic, literature, by, the, education, endowment, foundation, in, the, uk, have, found, that, starting, literacy, teaching, in, preschool, has, been, consistently, found, to, have, a, positive, effect, on, early, learning, outcomes, and, that, beginning, early, years, education, at, a, younger, age, appears, to, have, a, high, positive, impact, on, learning, outcomes, this, supports, current, standard, practice, in, the, uk, which, includes, developing, children, s, phonemic, awareness, in, preschool, and, teaching, reading, from, age, four, a, study, in, chicago, reports, that, an, early, education, program, for, children, from, low, income, families, is, estimated, to, generate, 4, to, 11, of, economic, benefits, over, a, child, s, lifetime, for, every, dollar, spent, initially, on, the, program, according, to, a, cost, benefit, analysis, funded, by, the, national, institutes, of, health, the, program, is, staffed, by, certified, teachers, and, offers, instruction, in, reading, and, math, group, activities, and, educational, field, trips, for, children, ages, 3, through, 9, there, does, not, appear, to, be, any, definitive, research, about, the, magic, window, to, begin, reading, instruction, however, there, is, also, no, definitive, research, to, suggest, that, starting, early, causes, any, harm, researcher, and, educator, timothy, shanahan, suggests, start, teaching, reading, from, the, time, you, have, kids, available, to, teach, and, pay, attention, to, how, they, respond, to, this, instruction, both, in, terms, of, how, well, they, are, learning, what, you, are, teaching, and, how, happy, and, invested, they, seem, to, be, if, you, haven, t, started, yet, don, t, feel, guilty, just, get, going, some, education, researchers, suggest, the, teaching, of, the, various, reading, components, by, specific, grade, levels, the, following, is, one, example, from, carol, tolman, ed, d, and, louisa, moats, ed, d, that, corresponds, in, many, respects, with, the, united, states, common, core, state, standards, initiative, the, percentage, of, us, students, who, failed, to, perform, at, or, above, the, nations, report, card, basic, reading, level, were, grade, 4, 37, in, 2022, grade, 8, 30, in, 2022, and, grade, 12, 30, in, 2019, as, a, result, many, secondary, school, teachers, devote, some, class, time, to, activities, related, to, foundational, reading, skills, the, following, chart, shows, the, percentage, of, k, 12, english, language, arts, teachers, that, engaged, in, foundational, reading, activities, with, students, i, e, engaging, every, student, in, a, class, in, activities, related, to, the, foundational, reading, skills, for, more, than, a, few, minutes, within, the, past, five, class, lessons, secondary, ela, teachers, in, states, with, reading, legislation, were, significantly, more, likely, to, report, frequently, engaging, their, students, in, these, activities, than, secondary, ela, teachers, in, states, without, such, legislation, even, though, only, one, quarter, of, states, with, these, laws, include, requirements, around, secondary, ela, instruction, the, path, to, skilled, reading, involves, learning, the, alphabetic, principle, phonemic, awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and, comprehension, british, psychologist, uta, frith, introduced, a, three, stage, model, to, acquire, skilled, reading, stage, one, is, the, logographic, or, pictorial, stage, where, students, attempt, to, grasp, words, as, objects, an, artificial, form, of, reading, stage, two, is, the, phonological, stage, where, students, learn, the, relationship, between, the, graphemes, letters, and, the, phonemes, sounds, stage, three, is, the, orthographic, stage, where, students, read, familiar, words, more, quickly, than, unfamiliar, words, and, word, length, gradually, ceases, to, play, a, role, another, recognized, expert, in, this, area, is, harvard, professor, jeanne, sternlicht, chall, in, 1983, she, published, a, book, entitled, stages, of, reading, development, that, proposed, six, stages, subsequently, in, 2008, maryanne, wolf, ucla, graduate, school, of, education, and, information, studies, published, a, book, entitled, proust, and, the, squid, in, which, she, describes, her, view, of, the, following, five, stages, of, reading, development, normally, children, will, move, through, these, stages, at, different, rates, however, typical, ages, for, children, in, the, united, states, are, shown, below, the, emerging, pre, reader, stage, also, known, as, reading, readiness, usually, lasts, for, the, first, five, years, of, a, child, s, life, children, typically, speak, their, first, few, words, before, their, first, birthday, educators, and, parents, help, learners, to, develop, their, skills, in, listening, speaking, reading, and, writing, reading, to, children, helps, them, to, develop, their, vocabulary, a, love, of, reading, and, phonemic, awareness, i, e, the, ability, to, hear, and, manipulate, the, individual, sounds, phonemes, of, oral, language, children, will, often, read, stories, they, have, memorized, however, in, the, late, 1990s, united, states, researchers, found, that, the, traditional, way, of, reading, to, children, made, little, difference, in, their, later, ability, to, read, because, children, spend, relatively, little, time, actually, looking, at, the, text, yet, in, a, shared, reading, program, with, four, year, old, children, teachers, found, that, directing, children, s, attention, to, the, letters, and, words, e, g, verbally, or, pointing, to, the, words, made, a, significant, difference, in, early, reading, spelling, and, comprehension, novice, readers, continue, to, develop, their, phonemic, awareness, and, come, to, realize, that, the, letters, graphemes, connect, to, the, sounds, phonemes, of, the, language, known, as, decoding, phonics, and, the, alphabetic, principle, they, may, also, memorize, the, most, common, letter, patterns, and, some, of, the, high, frequency, words, that, do, not, necessarily, follow, basic, phonological, rules, e, g, have, and, who, however, it, is, a, mistake, to, assume, a, reader, understands, the, meaning, of, a, text, merely, because, they, can, decode, it, vocabulary, and, oral, language, comprehension, are, also, important, parts, of, text, comprehension, as, described, in, the, simple, view, of, reading, scarborough, s, reading, rope, and, the, active, view, of, reading, model, reading, and, speech, are, codependent, reading, promotes, vocabulary, development, and, a, richer, vocabulary, facilitates, skilled, reading, the, transition, from, the, novice, reader, stage, to, the, decoding, stage, is, marked, by, a, reduction, of, painful, pronunciations, and, in, its, place, the, sounds, of, a, smoother, more, confident, reader, in, this, phase, the, reader, adds, at, least, 3, 000, words, to, what, they, can, decode, for, example, in, the, english, language, readers, now, learn, the, variations, of, the, vowel, based, rimes, e, g, s, at, m, at, c, at, and, vowel, pairs, also, digraph, e, g, r, ai, n, pl, ay, b, oa, t, as, readers, move, forward, they, learn, the, makeup, of, morphemes, i, e, stems, roots, prefixes, and, suffixes, they, learn, the, common, morphemes, such, as, s, and, ed, and, see, them, as, sight, chunks, the, faster, a, child, can, see, that, beheaded, is, be, head, ed, the, faster, they, will, become, a, more, fluent, reader, at, the, beginning, of, this, stage, a, child, will, often, be, devoting, so, much, mental, capacity, to, the, process, of, decoding, that, they, will, have, no, understanding, of, the, words, being, read, it, is, nevertheless, an, important, stage, allowing, the, child, to, achieve, their, ultimate, goal, of, becoming, fluent, and, automatic, it, is, in, the, decoding, phase, that, the, child, will, get, to, what, the, story, is, really, about, and, learn, to, re, read, a, passage, when, necessary, to, truly, understand, it, the, goal, of, this, stage, is, to, go, below, the, surface, of, the, text, and, in, the, process, the, reader, will, build, their, knowledge, of, spelling, substantially, teachers, and, parents, may, be, tricked, by, fluent, sounding, reading, into, thinking, that, a, child, understands, everything, that, they, are, reading, as, the, content, of, what, they, can, read, becomes, more, demanding, good, readers, will, develop, knowledge, of, figurative, language, and, irony, which, helps, them, to, discover, new, meanings, in, the, text, children, improve, their, comprehension, when, they, use, a, variety, of, tools, such, as, connecting, prior, knowledge, predicting, outcomes, drawing, inferences, and, monitoring, gaps, in, their, understanding, one, of, the, most, powerful, moments, is, when, fluent, comprehending, readers, learn, to, enter, into, the, lives, of, imagined, heroes, and, heroines, when, teaching, comprehension, the, educational, psychologist, g, michael, pressley, says, a, strong, case, can, be, made, for, instruction, in, decoding, vocabulary, word, knowledge, active, comprehension, strategies, and, self, monitoring, at, the, end, of, this, stage, many, processes, are, starting, to, become, automatic, allowing, the, reader, to, focus, on, meaning, with, the, decoding, process, almost, automatic, by, this, point, the, brain, learns, to, integrate, more, metaphorical, inferential, analogical, background, and, experiential, knowledge, this, stage, in, learning, to, read, will, often, last, until, early, adulthood, at, the, expert, stage, it, will, usually, only, take, a, reader, one, half, second, to, read, almost, any, word, the, degree, to, which, expert, reading, will, change, throughout, an, adult, s, life, depends, on, what, they, read, and, how, much, they, read, there, is, no, single, definition, of, the, science, of, reading, sor, foundational, skills, such, as, phonics, decoding, and, phonemic, awareness, are, considered, to, be, important, parts, of, the, science, of, reading, but, they, are, not, the, only, ingredients, sor, includes, any, research, and, evidence, about, how, humans, learn, to, read, and, how, reading, should, be, taught, this, includes, areas, such, as, oral, reading, fluency, vocabulary, morphology, reading, comprehension, text, spelling, and, pronunciation, thinking, strategies, oral, language, proficiency, working, memory, training, and, written, language, performance, e, g, cohesion, sentence, combining, reducing, in, addition, some, educators, feel, that, sor, should, include, digital, literacy, background, knowledge, content, rich, instruction, infrastructural,

equity, social, justice, and, supporting, underserved, populations, e, g, students, from, low, income, backgrounds, some, researchers, suggest, there, is, a, need, for, more, studies, on, the, relationship, between, theory, and, practice, they, say, we, know, more, about, the, science, of, reading, than, about, the, science, of, teaching, based, on, the, science, of, reading, and, there, are, many, layers, between, basic, science, findings, and, teacher, implementation, that, must, be, traversed, in, cognitive, science, there, is, likely, no, area, that, has, been, more, successful, than, the, study, of, reading, yet, in, many, countries, reading, levels, are, considered, low, in, the, united, states, the, 2019, nation, s, report, card, reported, that, 34, of, grade, four, public, school, students, performed, at, or, above, the, naep, proficient, level, solid, academic, performance, and, 65, performed, at, or, above, the, basic, level, partial, mastery, of, the, proficient, level, skills, as, reported, in, the, pirls, study, the, united, states, ranked, 15th, out, of, 50, countries, for, reading, comprehension, levels, of, fourth, graders, in, addition, according, to, the, 2011, 2018, piaac, study, out, of, 39, countries, the, united, states, ranked, 19th, for, literacy, levels, of, adults, 16, to, 65, and, 16, 9, of, adults, in, the, united, states, read, at, or, below, level, one, out, of, five, levels, many, researchers, are, concerned, that, low, reading, levels, are, due, to, how, reading, is, taught, they, point, to, three, areas, the, simple, view, of, reading, is, a, scientific, theory, about, reading, comprehension, according, to, the, theory, to, comprehend, what, they, are, reading, students, need, both, decoding, skills, and, oral, language, listening, comprehension, ability, neither, is, enough, on, their, own, in, other, words, they, need, the, ability, to, recognize, and, process, e, g, sound, out, the, text, and, the, ability, to, understand, the, language, in, which, the, text, is, written, i, e, vocabulary, grammar, and, background, knowledge, students, are, not, reading, if, they, can, decode, words, but, do, not, understand, their, meaning, similarly, students, are, not, reading, if, they, cannot, decode, words, that, they, would, ordinarily, recognize, and, understand, if, they, heard, them, spoken, out, loud, it, is, expressed, in, this, equation, decoding, oral, language, comprehension, reading, comprehension, as, shown, in, the, graphic, the, simple, view, of, reading, proposes, four, broad, categories, of, developing, readers, typical, readers, poor, readers, general, reading, disability, dyslexics, and, hyperlexics, hollis, scarborough, the, creator, of, the, reading, rope, and, senior, scientist, at, haskins, laboratories, is, a, leading, researcher, of, early, language, development, and, its, connection, to, later, literacy, scarborough, published, the, reading, rope, infographics, in, 2001, using, strands, of, rope, to, illustrate, the, many, ingredients, that, are, involved, in, becoming, a, skilled, reader, the, upper, strands, represent, language, comprehension, and, reinforce, one, another, the, lower, strands, represent, word, recognition, and, work, together, as, the, reader, becomes, accurate, fluent, and, automatic, through, practice, the, upper, and, lower, strands, all, weave, together, to, produce, a, skilled, reader, more, recent, research, by, laurie, e, cutting, and, hollis, s, scarborough, has, highlighted, the, importance, of, executive, function, processes, e, g, working, memory, planning, organization, self, monitoring, and, similar, abilities, to, reading, comprehension, easy, texts, do, not, require, many, executive, functions, however, more, difficult, text, requires, more, focus, on, the, ideas, reading, comprehension, strategies, such, as, summarizing, may, help, the, active, view, of, reading, avr, model, may, 7, 2021, nell, k, duke, and, kelly, b, cartwright, offers, an, alternative, to, the, simple, view, of, reading, svr, and, a, proposed, update, to, scarborough, s, reading, rope, srr, it, reflects, key, insights, from, scientific, research, on, reading, that, are, not, captured, in, the, svr, and, srr, although, the, avr, model, has, not, been, tested, as, a, whole, in, research, each, element, within, the, model, has, been, tested, in, instructional, research, demonstrating, positive, causal, influences, on, reading, comprehension, this, model, is, more, complete, than, the, simple, view, of, reading, and, does, a, better, job, of, accommodating, some, of, the, knowledge, about, reading, developed, over, the, past, several, decades, however, it, does, not, explain, how, these, variables, fit, together, how, their, relative, importance, changes, with, development, or, many, other, issues, relevant, to, reading, instruction, the, model, lists, contributors, to, reading, and, potential, causes, of, reading, difficulty, within, across, and, beyond, word, recognition, and, language, comprehension, including, the, elements, of, self, regulation, this, feature, of, the, model, reflects, the, research, documenting, that, not, all, profiles, of, reading, difficulty, are, explained, by, low, word, recognition, and, or, low, language, comprehension, a, second, feature, of, the, model, is, that, it, shows, how, word, recognition, and, language, comprehension, overlap, and, identifies, processes, that, bridge, these, constructs, the, following, chart, shows, the, ingredients, in, the, authors, infographic, in, addition, the, authors, point, out, that, reading, is, also, impacted, by, text, task, and, sociocultural, context, in, the, field, of, psychology, automaticity, is, the, ability, to, do, things, without, occupying, the, mind, with, the, low, level, details, required, allowing, it, to, become, an, automatic, response, pattern, or, a, habit, when, reading, is, automatic, precious, working, memory, resources, can, be, devoted, to, considering, the, meaning, of, a, text, etc, the, unexpected, finding, from, cognitive, science, is, that, practice, does, not, make, perfect, for, a, new, skill, to, become, automatic, sustained, practice, beyond, the, point, of, mastery, is, necessary, several, researchers, and, neuroscientists, have, attempted, to, explain, how, the, brain, reads, they, have, written, articles, and, books, and, created, websites, and, youtube, videos, to, help, the, average, consumer, neuroscientist, stanislas, dehaene, says, that, a, few, simple, truths, should, be, accepted, by, all, namely, a, all, children, have, similar, brains, are, well, tuned, to, systematic, grapheme, phoneme, correspondences, and, have, everything, to, gain, from, phonics, the, only, method, that, will, give, them, the, freedom, to, read, any, text, b, classroom, size, is, largely, irrelevant, if, the, proper, teaching, methods, are, used, c, it, is, essential, to, have, standardized, screening, tests, for, dyslexia, followed, by, appropriate, specialized, training, and, d, while, decoding, is, essential, vocabulary, enrichment, is, equally, important, a, study, conducted, at, the, medical, university, of, south, carolina, musc, in, 2022, indicates, that, greater, left, brain, asymmetry, can, predict, both, better, and, average, performance, on, a, foundational, level, of, reading, ability, depending, on, whether, the, analysis, is, conducted, over, the, whole, brain, or, in, specific, regions, there, have, been, correlations, between, specific, brain, regions, in, the, left, hemisphere, of, the, cerebral, cortex, during, different, reading, activities, although, it, is, not, included, in, most, meta, analytical, studies, the, sensorimotor, cortex, of, the, brain, is, the, most, active, region, of, the, brain, during, reading, this, is, often, disregarded, because, it, is, associated, solely, with, movement, however, a, 2014, fmri, study, involving, adults, and, children, participants, where, bodily, movement, was, restricted, demonstrated, strong, evidence, revealing, that, this, region, may, be, correlated, with, automatic, word, processing, and, decoding, the, results, of, this, study, found, this, portion, of, the, brain, to, be, highly, active, in, persons, who, were, learning, struggling, to, read, children, those, diagnosed, with, dyslexia, and, those, new, to, the, english, language, and, less, active, in, fluent, adult, readers, the, occipital, and, parietal, lobes, or, more, specifically, fusiform, gyrus, include, the, brain, s, visual, word, form, area, vwfa, the, vwfa, is, believed, to, be, responsible, for, the, brain, s, ability, to, read, visually, this, area, of, the, brain, tends, to, be, activated, when, words, are, presented, orthographically, as, found, in, a, study, in, 2002, where, participants, were, presented, with, word, and, non, word, stimuli, during, presentation, of, word, stimuli, this, portion, of, the, brain, was, extremely, active, however, during, presentation, of, stimuli, that, did, not, involve, graphemes, the, brain, was, less, active, participants, with, dyslexia, remained, outliers, with, this, area, of, the, brain, being, consistently, underactive, in, both, scenarios, the, two, major, regions, of, the, brain, associated, with, phonological, skills, are, the, temporal, parietal, region, and, the, perisylvian, region, in, an, fmri, study, conducted, in, 2001, participants, were, presented, with, written, words, verbal, frequency, words, and, verbal, pseudo, words, the, dorsal, upper, portion, of, the, temporal, parietal, region, was, the, most, active, during, the, pseudo, words, and, the, ventral, lower, portion, was, more, active, during, frequency, words, except, subjects, diagnosed, with, dyslexia, who, showed, no, impairment, to, their, ventral, region, but, under, activation, in, the, dorsal, portion, the, perisylvian, region, which, is, the, portion, of, the, brain, believed, to, connect, broca, s, and, wernicke, s, area, is, another, region, that, is, highly, active, during, phonological, activities, where, participants, are, asked, to, verbalize, known, and, unknown, words, damage, to, this, portion, of, this, brain, directly, affects, a, person, s, ability, to, speak, cohesively, and, with, sense, furthermore, this, portion, of, the, brain, activity, remains, consistent, for, both, dyslexic, and, non, dyslexic, readers, the, inferior, frontal, region, is, a, much, more, complex, region, of, the, brain, and, its, association, with, reading, is, not, necessarily, linear, for, it, is, active, in, several, reading, related, activities, several, studies, have, recorded, its, activity, in, association, with, comprehension, and, processing, skills, as, well, as, spelling, and, working, memory, although, the, exact, role, of, this, portion, of, the, brain, is, still, debatable, several, studies, indicate, that, this, area, of, the, brain, tends, to, be, more, active, in, readers, who, have, been, diagnosed, with, dyslexia, and, less, active, when, treatment, is, successfully, undergone, in, addition, to, regions, on, the, cortex, which, is, considered, gray, matter, on, fmri, s, there, are, several, white, matter, fasciculus, that, are, also, active, during, different, reading, activities, these, three, regions, are, what, connect, the, three, respected, cortex, regions, as, the, brain, reads, thus, are, responsible, for, the, brain, s, cross, model, integration, involved, in, reading, three, connective, fasciculus, that, are, prominently, active, during, reading, are, the, following, the, left, arcuate, faciculus, the, left, inferior, longitudinal, faciculus, and, the, superior, longitudinal, fasciculus, all, three, areas, are, found, to, be, weaker, in, readers, diagnosed, with, dyslexia, the, cerebellum, which, is, not, a, part, of, the, cerebral, cortex, is, also, believed, to, play, an, important, role, in, reading, when, the, cerebellum, is, impaired, victims, struggle, with, many, executive, functioning, and, organizational, skills, both, inside, and, outside, of, their, reading, ability, in, a, synthetic, fmri, study, specific, activities, that, displayed, significant, cerebellum, involvement, included, automation, word, accuracy, and, reading, speed, reading, is, an, intensive, process, in, which, the, eye, quickly, moves, to, assimilate, the, text, seeing, just, accurately, enough, to, interpret, groups, of, symbols, it, is, necessary, to, understand, visual, perception, and, eye, movement, in, reading, to, understand, the, reading, process, when, reading, the, eye, moves, continuously, along, a, line, of, text, but, makes, short, rapid, movements, saccades, intermingled, with, short, stops, fixations, there, is, considerable, variability, in, fixations, the, point, at, which, a, saccade, jumps, to, and, saccades, between, readers, and, even, for, the, same, person, reading, a, single, passage, of, text, when, reading, the, eye, has, a, perceptual, span, of, about, 20, slots, in, the, best, case, scenario, and, reading, english, when, the, eye, is, fixated, on, a, letter, four, to, five, letters, to, the, right, and, three, to, four, letters, to, the, left, can, be, clearly, identified, beyond, that, only, the, general, shape, of, some, letters, can, be, identified, the, eye, movements, of, deaf, readers, differ, from, those, of, readers, who, can, hear, and, skilled, deaf, readers, have, been, shown, to, have, shorter, fixations, and, fewer, refixations, when, reading, research, published, in, 2019, concluded, that, the, silent, reading, rate, of, adults, in, english, for, non, fiction, is, in, the, range, of, 175, to, 300, words, per, minute, wpm, and, for, fiction, the, range, is, 200, to, 320, words, per, minute, in, the, early, 1970s, the, dual, route, hypothesis, to, reading, aloud, was, proposed, according, to, which, there, are, two, separate, mental, mechanisms, involved, in, reading, aloud, with, output, from, both, contributing, to, the, pronunciation, of, written, words, one, mechanism, is, the, lexical, route, whereby, skilled, readers, can, recognize, a, word, as, part, of, their, sight, vocabulary, the, other, is, the, nonlexical, or, sublexical, route, in, which, the, reader, sounds, out, decodes, written, words, there, is, robust, evidence, that, saying, a, word, out, loud, makes, it, more, memorable, than, simply, reading, it, silently, or, hearing, someone, else, say, it, this, is, because, self, reference, and, self, control, over, speaking, produce, more, engagement, with, the, words, the, memory, benefit, of, hearing, oneself, is, referred, to, as, the, production, effect, this, has, implications, for, students, such, as, those, who, are, learning, to, read, the, results, of, studies, imply, that, oral, production, is, beneficial, because, it, entails, two, distinctive, components, speaking, a, motor, act, and, hearing, oneself, the, self, referential, auditory, input, it, is, also, thought, that, the, optimal, benefit, would, probably, come, from, reading, aloud, from, notes, that, the, student, took, at, the, time, of, initial, exposure, to, new, information, evidence, based, reading, instruction, refers, to, practices, having, research, evidence, showing, their, success, in, improving, reading, achievement, it, is, related, to, evidence, based, education, several, organizations, report, on, research, about, reading, instruction, for, example, a, systematic, review, and, meta, analysis, was, conducted, on, the, advantages, of, reading, from, paper, vs, screens, it, found, no, difference, in, reading, times, however, reading, from, paper, has, a, small, advantage, in, reading, performance, and, metacognition, other, studies, conclude, that, many, children, understand, more, from, reading, books, vs, screens, according, to, some, researchers, having, a, highly, qualified, teacher, in, every, classroom, is, an, educational, necessity, and, a, 2023, study, of, 512, classroom, teachers, in, 112, schools, showed, that, teachers, knowledge, of, language, and, literacy, reliably, predicted, students, reading, foundational, skills, scores, but, not, reading, comprehension, scores, yet, some, teachers, even, after, obtaining, a, master, s, degree, in, education, think, they, lack, the, necessary, knowledge, and, skills, to, teach, all, students, how, to, read, a, 2019, survey, of, k, 2, and, special, education, teachers, found, that, only, 11, percent, said, they, felt, completely, prepared, to, teach, early, reading, after, finishing, their, preservice, programs, and, a, 2021, study, found, that, most, u, s, states, do, not, measure, teachers, knowledge, of, the, science, of, reading, in, addition, according, to, one, study, as, few, as, 2, of, school, districts, use, reading, programs, that, follow, the, science, of, reading, mark, seidenberg, a, neuroscientist, states, that, with, few, exceptions, teachers, are, not, taught, to, teach, reading, and, don, t, know, what, they, don, t, know, a, survey, in, the, united, states, reported, that, 70, of, teachers, believe, in, a, balanced, literacy, approach, to, teaching, reading, however, balanced, literacy, is, not, systematic, explicit, instruction, teacher, researcher, and, author, louisa, moats, in, a, video, about, teachers, and, science, of, reading, says, that, sometimes, when, teachers, talk, about, their, philosophy, of, teaching, reading, she, responds, by, saying, but, your, philosophy, doesn, t, work, she, says, this, is, evidenced, by, the, fact, that, so, many, children, are, struggling, with, reading, on, another, occasion, when, asked, about, the, most, common, questions, teachers, ask, her, she, replied, over, and, over, they, ask, why, didn, t, anyone, teach, me, this, before, in, an, education, week, research, center, survey, of, more, than, 530, professors, of, reading, instruction, only, 22, percent, said, their, philosophy, of, teaching, early, reading, centered, on, explicit, systematic, phonics, with, comprehension, as, a, separate, focus, as, of, january, 24, 2024, after, mississippi, became, the, only, state, to, improve, reading, results, between, 2017, and, 2019, 37, u, s, states, and, the, district, of, columbia, have, since, passed, laws, or, implemented, new, policies, related, to, evidence, based, reading, instruction, these, requirements, relate, to, six, areas, teacher, preparation, teacher, certification, or, license, renewal, professional, development, or, coaching, assessment, material, and, instruction, or, intervention, as, a, result, many, schools, are, moving, away, from, balanced, literacy, programs, that, encourage, students, to, guess, a, word, and, are, introducing, phonics, where, they, learn, to, decode, sound, out, words, however, the, adoption, of, these, new, requirements, are, by, no, means, uniform, for, example, only, ten, states, have, requirements, in, all, six, areas, and, five, have, requirements, in, only, one, or, two, areas, only, nineteen, states, have, requirements, related, to, pre, service, teacher, certification, or, license, renewal, thirty, six, states, have, requirements, for, professional, development, or, coaching, and, thirty, one, require, teachers, to, use, specific, instructional, methods, or, interventions, for, struggling, readers, furthermore, eight, states, do, not, allow, or, require, 3rd, grade, retention, for, students, who, are, behind, in, reading, experts, say, it, is, uncertain, whether, these, new, initiatives, will, lead, to, real, improvements, in, children, s, reading, results, because, old, practices, prove, hard, to, shake, as, more, state, legislatures, seek, to, pass, science, of, reading, legislation, some, teachers, unions, are, mounting, opposition, citing, concerns, about, mandates, that, would, limit, teachers, professional, autonomy, in, the, classroom, uneven, implementation, unreasonable, timelines, and, the, amount, of, time, and, compensation, teachers, receive, for, additional, training, some, teachers, unions, in, particular, have, protested, attempts, to, ban, the, three, cueing, system, that, encourages, students, to, guess, at, the, pronunciation, of, words, using, pictures, etc, rather, than, to, decode, them, in, april, 2024, the, california, teachers, union, was, successful, in, stopping, a, bill, that, would, have, required, teachers, to, use, the, science, of, reading, arkansas, required, every, elementary, and, special, education, teacher, to, be, proficient, in, the, scientific, research, on, reading, by, 2021, causing, amy, murdoch, an, associate, professor, and, the, director, of, the, reading, science, program, at, mount, st, joseph, university, in, cincinnati, to, say, we, still, have, a, long, way, to, go, but, i, do, see, some, hope, in, 2021, the, department, of, education, and, early, childhood, development, of, new, brunswick, appears, to, be, the, first, in, canada, to, revise, its, k, 2, reading, curriculum, based, on, research, based, instructional, practice, for, example, it, replaced, the, various, cueing, systems, with, mastery, in, the, consolidated, alphabetic, to, skilled, reader, phase, although, one, document, on, the, site, dated, 1998, contains, references, to, such, practices, as, using, cueing, systems, which, is, at, odds, with, the, department, s, current, shift, to, using, evidence, based, practices, the, minister, of, education, in, ontario, canada, followed, by, stating, plans, to, revise, the, elementary, language, curriculum, and, the, grade, 9, english, course, with, scientific, evidence, based, approaches, that, emphasize, direct, explicit, and, systematic, instruction, and, removing, references, to, unscientific, discovery, and, inquiry, based, learning, including, the, three, cueing, system, by, 2023, some, non, profit, organizations, such, as, the, center, for, development, and, learning, louisiana, and, the, reading, league, new, york, state, offer, training, programs, for, teachers, to, learn, about, the, science, of, reading, researched, a, u, k, based, non, profit, since, 2013, has, organized, education, conferences, around, the, world, featuring, researchers, and, educators, in, order, to, promote, collaboration, between, research, users, and, research, creators, researcher, and, educator, timothy, shanahan, acknowledges, that, comprehensive, research, does, not, always, exist, for, specific, aspects, of, reading, instruction, however, the, lack, of, evidence, doesn, t, mean, something, doesn, t, work, only, that, we, don, t, know, he, suggests, that, teachers, make, use, of, the, research, that, is, available, in, such, places, as, journal, of, educational, psychology, reading, research, quarterly, reading, writing, quarterly, review, of, educational, research, and, scientific, studies, of, reading, if, a, practice, lacks, supporting, evidence, it, can, be, used, with, the, understanding, that, it, is, based, upon, a, claim, not, science, educators, have, debated, for, years, about, which, method, is, best, to, teach, reading, for, the, english, language, there, are, three, main, methods, phonics, whole, language, and, balanced, literacy, there, are, also, a, variety, of, other, areas, and, practices, such, as, phonemic, awareness, fluency, reading, comprehension, sight, words, and, sight, vocabulary, the, three, cueing, system, the, searchlights, model, in, england, guided, reading, shared, reading, and, leveled, reading, each, practice, is, employed, in, different, manners, depending, on, the, country, and, the, specific, school, division, in, 2001, some, researchers, reached, two, conclusions, 1, mastering, the, alphabetic, principle, is, essential, and, 2, instructional, techniques, namely, phonics, that, teach, this, principle, directly, are, more, effective, than, those, that, do, not, however, while, they, make, it, clear, they, have, some, fundamental, disagreements, with, some, of, the, claims, made, by, whole, language, advocates, some, principles, of, whole, language, have, value, such, as, the, need, to, ensure, that, students, are, enthusiastic, about, books, and, eager, to, learn, to, read, phonics, emphasizes, the, alphabetic, principle, the, idea, that, letters, graphemes, represent, the, sounds, of, speech, phonemes, it, is, taught, in, a, variety, of, ways, some, are, systematic, and, others, are, unsystematic, unsystematic, phonics, teaches, phonics, on, a, when, needed, basis, and, in, no, particular, sequence, systematic, phonics, uses, a, planned, sequential, introduction, of, a, set, of, phonic, elements, along, with, explicit, teaching, and, practice, of, those, elements, the, national, reading, panel, nrp, concluded, that, systematic, phonics, instruction, is, more, effective, than, unsystematic, phonics, or, non, phonics, instruction, phonics, approaches, include, analogy, phonics, analytic, phonics, embedded, phonics, with, mini, lessons, phonics, through, spelling, and, synthetic, phonics, according, to, a, 2018, review, of, research, related, to, english, speaking, poor, readers, phonics, training, is, effective, for, improving, literacy, related, skills, particularly, the, fluent, reading, of, words, and, non, words, and, the, accurate, reading, of, irregular, words, in, addition, phonics, produces, higher, achievement, for, all, beginning, readers, and, the, greatest, improvement, is, experienced, by, students, who, are, at, risk, of, failing, to, learn, to, read, while, some, children, can, infer, these, rules, on, their, own, some, need, explicit, instruction, on, phonics, rules, some, phonics, instruction, has, marked, benefits, such, as, the, expansion, of, a, student, s, vocabulary, overall, children, who, are, directly, taught, phonics, are, better, at, reading, spelling, and, comprehension, a, challenge, in, teaching, phonics, is, that, in, some, languages, such, as, english, complex, letter, sound, correspondences, can, confuse, beginning, readers, for, this, reason, it, is, recommended, that, teachers, of, english, reading, begin, by, introducing, the, most, frequent, sounds, and, the, common, spellings, and, save, the, less, frequent, sounds, and, complex, spellings, for, later, e, g, the, sounds, s, and, t, before, v, and, w, and, the, spellings, c, a, ke, before, eigh, t, and, c, at, before, du, ck, phonics, is, gaining, world, wide, acceptance, phonics, is, taught, in, many, different, ways, and, it, is, often, taught, together, with, some, of, the, following, oral, language, skills, concepts, about, print, phonological, awareness, phonemic, awareness, phonology, oral, reading, fluency, vocabulary, syllables, reading, comprehension, spelling, word, study, cooperative, learning, multisensory, learning, and, guided, reading, and, phonics, is, often, featured, in, discussions, about, science, of, reading, and, evidence, based, practices, the, national, reading, panel, u, s, 2000, is, clear, that, systematic, phonics, instruction, should, be, integrated, with, other, reading, instruction, to, create, a, balanced, reading, program, it, suggests, that, phonics, be, taught, together, with, phonemic, awareness, oral, fluency, vocabulary, and, comprehension, researcher, and, educator, timothy, shanahan, a, member, of, that, panel, recommends, that, primary, students, receive, 60, 90, minutes, per, day, of, explicit, systematic, literacy, instruction, time, and, that, it, be, divided, equally, between, a, words, and, word, parts, e, g, letters, sounds, decoding, and, phonemic, awareness, b, oral, reading, fluency, c, reading, comprehension, and, d, writing, furthermore, he, states, that, the, phonemic, awareness, skills, found, to, give, the, greatest, reading, advantage, to, kindergarten, and, first, grade, children, are, segmenting, and, blending, the, ontario, association, of, deans, of, education, canada, published, research, monograph, 37, entitled, supporting, early, language, and, literacy, with, suggestions, for, parents, and, teachers, in, helping, children, prior, to, grade, one, it, covers, the, areas, of, letter, names, and, letter, sound, correspondence, phonics, as, well, as, conversation, play, based, learning, print, phonological, awareness, shared, reading, and, vocabulary, some, researchers, report, that, teaching, reading, without, teaching, phonics, is, harmful, to, large, numbers, of, students, yet, not, all, phonics, teaching, programs, produce, effective, results, the, reason, is, that, the, effectiveness, of, a, program, depends, on, using, the, right, curriculum, together, with, the, appropriate, approach, to, instruction, techniques, classroom, management, grouping, and, other, factors, louisa, moats, a, teacher, psychologist, and, researcher, has, long, advocated, for, reading, instruction, that, is, direct, explicit, and, systematic, covering, phoneme, awareness, decoding, comprehension, literature, appreciation, and, daily, exposure, to, a, variety, of, texts, she, maintains, that, reading, failure, can, be, prevented, in, all, but, a, small, percentage, of, children, with, serious, learning, disorders, it, is, possible, to, teach, most, students, how, to, read, if, we, start, early, and, follow, the, significant, body, of, research, showing, which, practices, are, most, effective, interest, in, evidence, based, education, appears, to, be, growing, in, 2021, best, evidence, encyclopedia, bee, released, a, review, of, research, on, 51, different, programs, for, struggling, readers, in, elementary, schools, many, of, the, programs, used, phonics, based, teaching, and, or, one, or, more, of, the, following, cooperative, learning, technology, supported, adaptive, instruction, see, educational, technology, metacognitive, skills, phonemic, awareness, word, reading, fluency, vocabulary, multisensory, learning, spelling, guided, reading, reading, comprehension, word, analysis, structured, curriculum, and, balanced, literacy, non, phonetic, approach, the, bee, review, concludes, that, a, outcomes, were, positive, for, one, to, one, tutoring, b, outcomes, were, positive, but, not, as, large, for, one, to, small, group, tutoring, c, there, were, no, differences, in, outcomes, between, teachers, and, teaching, assistants, as, tutors, d, technology, supported, adaptive, instruction, did, not, have, positive, outcomes, e, whole, class, approaches, mostly, cooperative, learning, and, whole, school, approaches, incorporating, tutoring, obtained, outcomes, for, struggling, readers, as, large, as, those, found, for, one, to, one, tutoring, and, benefitted, many, more, students, and, f, approaches, mixing, classroom, and, school, improvements, with, tutoring, for, the, most, at, risk, students, have, the, greatest, potential, for, the, largest, numbers, of, struggling, readers, robert, slavin, of, bee, goes, so, far, as, to, suggest, that, states, should, hire, thousands, of, tutors, to, support, students, scoring, far, below, grade, level, particularly, in, elementary, school, reading, research, he, says, shows, only, tutoring, both, one, to, one, and, one, to, small, group, in, reading, and, mathematics, had, an, effect, size, larger, than, 0, 10, averages, are, around, 0, 30, and, well, trained, teaching, assistants, using, structured, tutoring, materials, or, software, can, obtain, outcomes, as, good, as, those, obtained, by, certified, teachers, as, tutors, what, works, clearinghouse, allows, you, to, see, the, effectiveness, of, specific, programs, for, example, as, of, 2020,

support, to, inform, program, selection, systematic, phonics, is, not, one, specific, method, of, teaching, phonics, it, is, a, term, used, to, describe, phonics, approaches, that, are, taught, explicitly, and, in, a, structured, systematic, manner, they, are, systematic, because, the, letters, and, the, sounds, they, relate, to, are, taught, in, a, specific, sequence, as, opposed, to, incidentally, or, on, a, when, needed, basis, the, national, reading, panel, nrp, concluded, that, systematic, phonics, instruction, is, more, effective, than, unsystematic, phonics, or, non, phonics, instruction, the, nrp, also, found, that, systematic, phonics, instruction, is, effective, with, varying, degrees, when, delivered, through, one, to, one, tutoring, small, groups, and, teaching, classes, of, students, and, is, effective, from, kindergarten, onward, the, earlier, the, better, it, helps, significantly, with, word, reading, skills, and, reading, comprehension, for, kindergartners, and, 1st, graders, as, well, as, for, older, struggling, readers, and, reading, disabled, students, benefits, to, spelling, were, positive, for, kindergartners, and, 1st, graders, but, not, for, older, students, systematic, phonics, is, sometimes, mischaracterised, as, skill, and, drill, with, little, attention, to, meaning, however, researchers, point, out, that, this, impression, is, false, teachers, can, use, engaging, games, or, materials, to, teach, letter, sound, connections, and, it, can, also, be, incorporated, with, the, reading, of, meaningful, text, phonics, can, be, taught, systematically, in, a, variety, of, ways, such, as, analogy, phonics, analytic, phonics, phonics, through, spelling, and, synthetic, phonics, however, their, effectiveness, varies, considerably, because, the, methods, differ, in, such, areas, as, the, range, of, letter, sound, coverage, the, structure, of, the, lesson, plans, and, the, time, devoted, to, specific, instructions, systematic, phonics, has, gained, increased, acceptance, in, different, parts, of, the, world, since, the, completion, of, three, major, studies, into, teaching, reading, one, in, the, us, in, 2000, another, in, australia, in, 2005, and, the, other, in, the, uk, in, 2006, in, 2009, the, uk, department, of, education, published, a, curriculum, review, that, added, support, for, systematic, phonics, in, fact, systematic, phonics, in, the, uk, is, known, as, synthetic, phonics, beginning, as, early, as, 2014, several, states, in, the, united, states, have, changed, their, curriculum, to, include, systematic, phonics, instruction, in, elementary, school, in, 2018, the, state, government, of, victoria, australia, published, a, website, containing, a, comprehensive, literacy, teaching, toolkit, including, effective, reading, instruction, phonics, and, sample, phonics, lessons, analytic, phonics, does, not, involve, pronouncing, individual, sounds, phonemes, in, isolation, and, blending, the, sounds, as, is, done, in, synthetic, phonics, rather, it, is, taught, at, the, word, level, and, students, learn, to, analyze, letter, sound, relationships, once, the, word, is, identified, for, example, students, analyze, letter, sound, correspondences, such, as, the, ou, spelling, of, a, in, shr, ou, ds, also, students, might, be, asked, to, practice, saying, words, with, similar, sounds, such, as, b, all, b, at, and, b, ite, furthermore, students, are, taught, consonant, blends, separate, adjacent, consonants, as, units, such, as, br, eak, or, shr, ouds, analogy, phonics, is, a, particular, type, of, analytic, phonics, in, which, the, teacher, has, students, analyze, phonic, elements, according, to, the, speech, sounds, phonograms, in, the, word, for, example, a, type, of, phonogram, known, in, linguistics, as, a, rime, is, composed, of, the, vowel, and, the, consonant, sounds, that, follow, it, e, g, in, the, words, cat, mat, and, sat, the, rime, is, at, teachers, using, the, analogy, method, may, have, students, memorize, a, bank, of, phonograms, such, as, at, or, am, or, use, word, families, e, g, c, an, r, an, m, an, or, m, ay, pl, ay, s, ay, there, have, been, studies, on, the, effectiveness, of, instruction, using, analytic, phonics, vs, synthetic, phonics, johnston, et, al, 2012, conducted, experimental, research, studies, that, tested, the, effectiveness, of, phonics, learning, instruction, among, 10, year, old, boys, and, girls, they, used, comparative, data, from, the, clackmannanshire, report, and, chose, 393, participants, to, compare, synthetic, phonics, instruction, and, analytic, phonics, instruction, the, boys, taught, by, the, synthetic, phonics, method, had, better, word, reading, than, the, girls, in, their, classes, and, their, spelling, and, reading, comprehension, was, as, good, on, the, other, hand, with, analytic, phonics, teaching, although, the, boys, performed, as, well, as, the, girls, in, word, reading, they, had, inferior, spelling, and, reading, comprehension, overall, the, group, taught, by, synthetic, phonics, had, better, word, reading, spelling, and, reading, comprehension, and, synthetic, phonics, did, not, lead, to, any, impairment, in, the, reading, of, irregular, words, embedded, phonics, also, known, as, incidental, phonics, is, the, type, of, phonics, instruction, used, in, whole, language, programs, it, is, not, systematic, phonics, although, phonics, skills, are, de, emphasised, in, whole, language, programs, some, teachers, include, phonics, mini, lessons, when, students, struggle, with, words, while, reading, from, a, book, short, lessons, are, included, based, on, phonics, elements, the, students, are, having, trouble, with, or, on, a, new, or, difficult, phonics, pattern, that, appears, in, a, class, reading, assignment, the, focus, on, meaning, is, generally, maintained, but, the, mini, lesson, provides, some, time, for, focus, on, individual, sounds, and, the, letters, that, represent, them, embedded, phonics, is, different, from, other, methods, because, instruction, is, always, in, the, context, of, literature, rather, than, in, separate, lessons, about, distinct, sounds, and, letters, and, skills, are, taught, when, an, opportunity, arises, not, systematically, for, some, teachers, this, is, a, method, of, teaching, spelling, by, using, the, sounds, phonemes, however, it, can, also, be, a, method, of, teaching, reading, by, focusing, on, the, sounds, and, their, spelling, i, e, phonemes, and, syllables, it, is, taught, systematically, with, guided, lessons, conducted, in, a, direct, and, explicit, manner, including, appropriate, feedback, sometimes, mnemonic, cards, containing, individual, sounds, are, used, to, allow, the, student, to, practice, saying, the, sounds, that, are, related, to, a, letter, or, letters, e, g, a, e, i, o, u, accuracy, comes, first, followed, by, speed, the, sounds, may, be, grouped, by, categories, such, as, vowels, that, sound, short, e, g, c, a, t, and, s, i, t, when, the, student, is, comfortable, recognizing, and, saying, the, sounds, the, following, steps, might, be, followed, a, the, tutor, says, a, target, word, and, the, student, repeats, it, out, loud, b, the, student, writes, down, each, individual, sound, letter, until, the, word, is, completely, spelled, saying, each, sound, as, it, is, written, and, c, the, student, says, the, entire, word, out, loud, an, alternate, method, would, be, to, have, the, student, use, mnemonic, cards, to, sound, out, spell, the, target, word, typically, the, instruction, starts, with, sounds, that, have, only, one, letter, and, simple, cvc, words, such, as, sat, and, pin, then, it, progresses, to, longer, words, and, sounds, with, more, than, one, letter, e, g, h, ea, r, and, d, ay, and, perhaps, even, syllables, e, g, wa, ter, sometimes, the, student, practices, by, saying, or, sounding, out, cards, that, contain, entire, words, synthetic, phonics, also, known, as, blended, phonics, is, a, systematic, phonics, method, employed, to, teach, students, to, read, by, sounding, out, the, letters, and, then, blend, the, sounds, to, form, the, word, this, method, involves, learning, how, letters, or, letter, groups, represent, individual, sounds, and, that, those, sounds, are, blended, to, form, a, word, for, example, shrouds, would, be, read, by, pronouncing, the, sounds, for, each, spelling, sh, r, ou, d, s, ipa, r, a, d, z, then, blending, those, sounds, orally, to, produce, a, spoken, word, sh, r, ou, d, s, shrouds, ipa, r, a, d, z, the, goal, of, a, synthetic, phonics, instructional, program, is, that, students, identify, the, sound, symbol, correspondences, and, blend, their, phonemes, automatically, since, 2005, synthetic, phonics, has, become, the, accepted, method, of, teaching, reading, by, phonics, instruction, in, england, scotland, and, australia, the, 2005, rose, report, from, the, uk, concluded, that, systematic, synthetic, phonics, was, the, most, effective, method, for, teaching, reading, it, also, suggests, the, best, teaching, includes, a, brisk, pace, engaging, children, s, interest, with, multi, sensory, activities, and, stimulating, resources, praise, for, effort, and, achievement, and, above, all, the, full, backing, of, the, headteacher, it, also, has, considerable, support, in, some, states, in, the, u, s, and, some, support, from, expert, panels, in, canada, in, the, us, a, pilot, program, using, the, core, knowledge, early, literacy, program, that, used, this, type, of, phonics, approach, showed, significantly, higher, results, in, k, 3, reading, compared, with, comparison, schools, in, addition, several, states, such, as, california, ohio, new, york, and, arkansas, are, promoting, the, principles, of, synthetic, phonics, see, synthetic, phonics, in, the, united, states, resources, for, teaching, phonics, are, available, here, phonemic, awareness, is, the, process, by, which, the, phonemes, sounds, of, oral, language, are, heard, interpreted, understood, and, manipulated, unrelated, to, their, grapheme, written, language, it, is, a, sub, set, of, phonological, awareness, that, includes, the, manipulation, of, rhymes, syllables, and, onsets, and, rimes, and, is, most, prevalent, in, alphabetic, systems, the, specific, part, of, speech, depends, on, the, writing, system, employed, the, national, reading, panel, npr, concluded, that, phonemic, awareness, improves, a, learner, s, ability, to, learn, to, read, when, teaching, phonemic, awareness, the, nrp, found, that, better, results, were, obtained, with, focused, and, explicit, instruction, of, one, or, two, elements, over, five, or, more, hours, in, small, groups, and, using, the, corresponding, graphemes, letters, see, also, speech, perception, as, mentioned, earlier, some, researchers, feel, that, the, most, effective, way, of, teaching, phonemic, awareness, is, through, segmenting, and, blending, a, key, part, of, synthetic, phonics, a, critical, aspect, of, reading, comprehension, is, vocabulary, development, when, a, reader, encounters, an, unfamiliar, word, in, print, and, decodes, it, to, derive, its, spoken, pronunciation, the, reader, understands, the, word, if, it, is, in, the, reader, s, spoken, vocabulary, otherwise, the, reader, must, derive, the, meaning, of, the, word, using, another, strategy, such, as, context, if, the, development, of, the, child, s, vocabulary, is, impeded, by, things, such, as, ear, infections, that, inhibit, the, child, from, hearing, new, words, consistently, then, the, development, of, reading, will, also, be, impaired, sight, words, i, e, high, frequency, or, common, words, sometimes, called, the, look, say, or, whole, word, method, are, not, a, part, of, the, phonics, method, they, are, usually, associated, with, whole, language, and, balanced, literacy, where, students, are, expected, to, memorize, common, words, such, as, those, on, the, dolch, word, list, and, the, fry, word, list, e, g, a, be, call, do, eat, fall, gave, etc, the, supposition, in, whole, language, and, balanced, literacy, is, that, students, will, learn, to, read, more, easily, if, they, memorize, the, most, common, words, they, will, encounter, especially, words, that, are, not, easily, decoded, i, e, exceptions, on, the, other, hand, using, sight, words, as, a, method, of, teaching, reading, in, english, is, seen, as, being, at, odds, with, the, alphabetic, principle, and, treating, english, as, though, it, was, a, logographic, language, e, g, chinese, or, japanese, in, addition, according, to, research, whole, word, memorization, is, labor, intensive, requiring, on, average, about, 35, trials, per, word, also, phonics, advocates, say, that, most, words, are, decodable, so, comparatively, few, words, have, to, be, memorized, and, because, a, child, will, over, time, encounter, many, low, frequency, words, the, phonological, recoding, mechanism, is, a, very, powerful, indeed, essential, mechanism, throughout, reading, development, furthermore, researchers, suggest, that, teachers, who, withhold, phonics, instruction, to, make, it, easier, on, children, are, having, the, opposite, effect, by, making, it, harder, for, children, to, gain, basic, word, recognition, skills, they, suggest, that, learners, should, focus, on, understanding, the, principles, of, phonics, so, they, can, recognize, the, phonemic, overlaps, among, words, e, g, have, had, has, having, haven, t, etc, making, it, easier, to, decode, them, all, sight, vocabulary, is, a, part, of, the, phonics, method, it, describes, words, that, are, stored, in, long, term, memory, and, read, automatically, skilled, fully, alphabetic, readers, learn, to, store, words, in, long, term, memory, without, memorization, i, e, a, mental, dictionary, making, reading, and, comprehension, easier, once, you, know, the, sound, based, way, to, decode, your, mind, learns, what, words, look, like, even, if, you, re, not, especially, trying, to, do, so, the, process, called, orthographic, mapping, involves, decoding, crosschecking, mental, marking, and, rereading, it, takes, significantly, less, time, than, memorization, this, process, works, for, fully, alphabetic, readers, when, reading, simple, decodable, words, from, left, to, right, through, the, word, irregular, words, pose, more, of, a, challenge, yet, research, in, 2018, concluded, that, fully, alphabetic, students, learn, irregular, words, more, easily, when, they, use, a, process, called, hierarchical, decoding, in, this, process, students, rather, than, decode, from, left, to, right, are, taught, to, focus, attention, on, the, irregular, elements, such, as, a, vowel, digraph, and, a, silent, e, for, example, break, b, r, ea, k, height, h, eigh, t, touch, t, ou, ch, and, make, m, a, k, e, consequentially, they, suggest, that, teachers, and, tutors, should, focus, on, teaching, decoding, with, more, advanced, vowel, patterns, before, expecting, young, readers, to, tackle, irregular, words, others, recommend, teaching, the, high, frequency, words, i, e, fry, word, list, by, focusing, on, the, sound, symbol, relations, i, e, phonics, fluency, is, the, ability, to, read, orally, with, speed, accuracy, and, vocal, expression, the, ability, to, read, fluently, is, one, of, several, critical, factors, necessary, for, reading, comprehension, if, a, reader, is, not, fluent, it, may, be, difficult, to, remember, what, has, been, read, and, to, relate, the, ideas, expressed, in, the, text, to, their, background, knowledge, this, accuracy, and, automaticity, of, reading, serves, as, a, bridge, between, decoding, and, comprehension, one, way, to, improve, fluency, is, rereading, the, student, rereads, a, passage, aloud, several, times, with, vocal, expression, another, is, assisted, reading, the, student, visually, reads, a, text, while, simultaneously, hearing, someone, else, fluently, read, the, same, text, the, nrp, describes, reading, comprehension, as, a, complex, cognitive, process, in, which, a, reader, intentionally, and, interactively, engages, with, the, text, the, science, of, reading, says, that, reading, comprehension, is, heavily, dependent, on, word, recognition, i, e, phonological, awareness, decoding, etc, and, oral, language, comprehension, i, e, background, knowledge, vocabulary, etc, phonological, awareness, and, rapid, naming, predict, reading, comprehension, in, second, grade, but, oral, language, skills, account, for, an, additional, 13, 8, of, the, variance, it, has, also, been, found, that, sustained, content, literacy, intervention, instruction, that, gradually, builds, thematic, connections, may, help, young, children, transfer, their, knowledge, to, related, topics, leading, to, improved, comprehension, the, american, educator, eric, e, d, donald, hirsch, jr, suggests, that, students, need, to, learn, about, something, in, order, to, read, well, however, some, researchers, say, reading, comprehension, instruction, has, become, content, agnostic, focused, on, skill, practice, such, as, finding, the, main, idea, to, the, detriment, of, learning, about, science, history, and, other, disciplines, instead, they, say, teachers, should, find, ways, to, integrate, content, knowledge, with, reading, and, writing, instruction, one, approach, is, to, merge, the, two, to, embed, literacy, instruction, into, social, studies, and, science, another, approach, is, to, build, content, knowledge, into, reading, classes, often, called, high, quality, or, content, rich, curricula, however, according, to, natalie, wexler, in, her, book, the, knowledge, gap, making, the, shift, to, knowledge, is, as, much, about, changing, teachers, beliefs, and, daily, practice, as, about, changing, the, materials, they, re, supposed, to, use, researcher, and, educator, timothy, shanahan, believes, the, most, effective, way, to, improve, reading, comprehension, skills, is, to, teach, students, to, summarize, develop, an, understanding, of, text, structure, and, paraphrase, evidence, supports, the, strong, synergy, between, reading, decoding, and, spelling, encoding, especially, for, children, in, kindergarten, or, grade, one, and, elementary, school, students, at, risk, for, literacy, difficulties, students, receiving, encoding, instruction, and, guided, practice, that, included, using, a, manipulatives, such, as, letter, tiles, to, learn, phoneme, grapheme, relationships, and, words, and, b, writing, phoneme, grapheme, relationships, and, words, made, from, these, correspondences, significantly, outperformed, contrast, groups, not, receiving, encoding, instruction, research, supports, the, use, of, embedded, picture, mnemonic, memory, support, alphabet, cards, when, teaching, letters, and, sounds, but, not, words, whole, language, has, the, reputation, of, being, a, meaning, based, method, of, teaching, reading, that, emphasizes, literature, and, text, comprehension, it, discourages, any, significant, use, of, phonics, if, at, all, instead, it, trains, students, to, focus, on, words, sentences, and, paragraphs, as, a, whole, rather, than, letters, and, sounds, students, are, taught, to, use, context, and, pictures, to, guess, words, they, do, not, recognize, or, even, just, skip, them, and, read, on, it, aims, to, make, reading, fun, yet, many, students, struggle, to, figure, out, the, specific, rules, of, the, language, on, their, own, which, causes, the, student, s, decoding, and, spelling, to, suffer, the, following, are, some, features, of, the, whole, language, philosophy, as, of, 2020, whole, language, is, widely, used, in, the, us, and, canada, often, as, balanced, literacy, however, in, some, us, states, and, many, other, countries, such, as, australia, and, the, united, kingdom, it, has, lost, favor, or, been, abandoned, because, it, is, not, supported, by, evidence, some, notable, researchers, have, clearly, stated, their, disapproval, of, whole, language, and, whole, word, teaching, in, his, 2009, book, reading, in, the, brain, cognitive, neuroscientist, stanislas, dehaene, said, cognitive, psychology, directly, refutes, any, notion, of, teaching, via, a, global, or, whole, language, method, he, goes, on, to, talk, about, the, myth, of, whole, word, reading, saying, it, has, been, refuted, by, recent, experiments, we, do, not, recognize, a, printed, word, through, a, holistic, grasping, of, its, contours, because, our, brain, breaks, it, down, into, letters, and, graphemes, in, addition, cognitive, neuroscientist, mark, seidenberg, in, his, 2017, book, language, at, the, speed, of, light, refers, to, whole, language, as, a, theoretical, zombie, because, it, persists, despite, a, lack, of, supporting, evidence, balanced, literacy, is, not, well, defined, however, it, is, intended, as, a, method, that, combines, elements, of, both, phonics, and, whole, language, according, to, a, survey, in, 2010, 68, of, elementary, school, teachers, in, the, united, states, profess, to, use, balanced, literacy, however, only, 52, of, teachers, in, the, united, states, include, phonics, in, their, definition, of, balanced, literacy, the, national, reading, panel, concluded, that, phonics, must, be, integrated, with, instruction, in, phonemic, awareness, vocabulary, fluency, and, comprehension, and, some, studies, indicate, that, the, addition, of, language, activities, and, tutoring, to, phonics, produced, larger, effects, than, any, of, these, components, in, isolation, they, suggest, that, this, may, be, a, constructive, way, to, view, balanced, reading, instruction, however, balanced, literacy, has, received, criticism, from, researchers, and, others, suggesting, that, in, many, instances, it, is, merely, whole, language, by, another, name, according, to, phonics, advocate, and, cognitive, neuroscientist, mark, seidenberg, balanced, literacy, allows, educators, to, diffuse, the, reading, wars, while, not, making, specific, recommendations, for, change, he, goes, on, to, say, that, in, his, opinion, the, high, number, of, struggling, readers, in, the, united, states, is, the, result, of, how, teachers, are, taught, to, teach, reading, he, also, says, that, struggling, readers, should, not, be, encouraged, to, skip, a, challenging, word, nor, rely, on, pictures, or, semantic, and, syntactic, cues, to, guess, at, a, challenging, word, instead, they, should, use, evidence, based, decoding, methods, such, as, systematic, phonics, structured, literacy, has, many, of, the, elements, of, systematic, phonics, and, few, of, the, elements, of, balanced, literacy, it, is, defined, as, explicit, systematic, teaching, that, focuses, on, phonological, awareness, word, recognition, phonics, and, decoding, spelling, and, syntax, at, the, sentence, and, paragraph, levels, it, is, considered, to, be, beneficial, for, all, early, literacy, learners, especially, those, with, dyslexia, according, to, the, international, dyslexia, association, structured, literacy, contains, the, elements, of, phonology, and, phonemic, awareness, sound, symbol, association, the, alphabetic, principle, and, phonics, syllables, morphology, syntax, and, semantics, the, elements, are, taught, using, methods, that, are, systematic, cumulative, explicit, multisensory, and, use, diagnostic, assessment, the, three, cueing, system, the, searchlights, model, in, england, is, a, theory, that, has, been, circulating, since, the, 1980s, its, roots, are, in, the, theories, proposed, in, the, 1960s, by, ken, goodman, and, marie, clay, that, eventually, became, whole, language, reading, recovery, and, guided, reading, e, g, fountas, and, pinnell, early, reading, programs, as, of, 2010, 75, of, teachers, in, the, united, states, teach, the, three, cueing, system, it, proposes, that, children, who, are, stuck, on, a, word, should, use, various, cues, to, figure, it, out, and, determine, guess, its, meaning, the, meaning, cues, are, semantic, does, it, make, sense, in, the, context, syntactic, is, it, a, noun, verb, etc, and, graphophonic, what, are, the, letter, sound, relationships, it, is, also, known, as, msv, m, eaning, s, entence, structure, syntax, and, v, isual, information, such, as, the, letters, in, the, words, according, to, some, three, cueing, is, not, the, most, effective, way, for, beginning, readers, to, learn, how, to, decode, printed, text, while, a, cueing, system, does, help, students, to, make, better, guesses, it, does, not, help, when, the, words, become, more, sophisticated, and, it, reduces, the, amount, of, practice, time, available, to, learn, essential, decoding, skills, they, also, say, that, students, should, first, decode, the, word, then, they, can, use, context, to, figure, out, the, meaning, of, any, word, they, don, t, understand, consequently, researchers, such, as, cognitive, neuroscientists, mark, seidenberg, and, timothy, shanahan, do, not, support, the, theory, they, say, the, three, cueing, system, s, value, in, reading, instruction, is, a, magnificent, work, of, the, imagination, and, it, developed, not, because, teachers, lack, integrity, commitment, motivation, sincerity, or, intelligence, but, because, they, were, poorly, trained, and, advised, about, the, science, of, reading, in, england, the, simple, view, of, reading, and, synthetic, phonics, are, intended, to, replace, the, searchlights, multi, cueing, model, on, the, other, hand, some, researchers, suggest, that, context, can, be, useful, not, to, guess, a, word, but, to, confirm, a, word, after, it, has, been, phonetically, decoded, the, three, ps, approach, is, used, by, teachers, tutors, and, parents, to, guide, oral, reading, practice, with, a, struggling, reader, for, some, it, is, merely, a, variation, of, the, above, mentioned, three, cueing, system, however, for, others, it, is, very, different, for, example, when, a, student, encounters, a, word, they, do, not, know, or, get, it, wrong, the, three, steps, are, 1, pause, to, see, if, they, can, fix, it, themselves, even, letting, them, read, on, a, little, 2, prompt, them, with, strategies, to, find, the, correct, pronunciation, and, 3, praise, them, directly, and, genuinely, in, the, prompt, step, the, tutor, does, not, suggest, the, student, skip, the, word, or, guess, the, word, based, on, the, pictures, or, the, first, sound, instead, they, encourage, students, to, use, their, decoding, training, to, sound, out, the, word, and, use, the, context, meaning, to, confirm, they, have, found, the, correct, word, guided, reading, is, small, group, reading, instruction, that, is, intended, to, allow, for, the, differences, in, students, reading, abilities, while, they, are, reading, students, are, encouraged, to, use, strategies, from, the, three, cueing, system, the, searchlights, model, or, msv, it, is, no, longer, supported, by, the, primary, national, strategy, in, england, as, synthetic, phonics, is, the, officially, recognized, method, for, teaching, reading, in, the, united, states, guided, reading, is, part, of, the, reading, workshop, model, of, reading, instruction, the, reading, workshop, model, provides, students, with, a, collection, of, books, allows, them, the, choice, of, what, to, read, limits, students, reading, to, texts, that, can, be, easily, read, by, them, provides, teaching, through, mini, lessons, and, monitors, and, supports, reading, comprehension, development, through, one, on, one, teacher, student, conferences, some, reports, state, that, it, is, unlikely, to, lead, to, literacy, success, for, all, students, particularly, those, lacking, foundational, skills, shared, oral, reading, is, an, activity, whereby, the, teacher, and, students, read, from, a, shared, text, that, is, determined, to, be, at, the, students, reading, level, leveled, reading, involves, students, reading, from, leveled, books, at, an, appropriate, reading, level, a, student, who, struggles, with, a, word, is, encouraged, to, use, a, cueing, system, e, g, three, cueing, searchlights, model, or, msv, to, guess, its, meaning, many, systems, purport, to, gauge, the, students, reading, levels, using, scales, incorporating, numbers, letters, colors, and, lexile, readability, scores, silent, reading, and, self, teaching, is, a, common, practice, in, elementary, schools, a, 2007, study, in, the, united, states, found, that, on, average, only, 37, of, class, time, was, spent, on, active, reading, instruction, or, practice, and, the, most, frequent, activity, was, students, reading, silently, based, on, the, limited, available, studies, on, silent, reading, the, nrp, concluded, that, independent, silent, reading, did, not, prove, an, effective, practice, when, used, as, the, only, type, of, reading, instruction, to, develop, fluency, and, other, reading, skills, particularly, with, students, who, have, not, yet, developed, critical, alphabetic, and, word, reading, skills, other, studies, indicate, that, unlike, silent, reading, oral, reading, increases, phonological, effects, according, to, some, the, classroom, method, called, dear, drop, everything, and, read, is, not, the, best, use, of, classroom, time, for, students, who, are, not, yet, fluent, however, according, to, the, self, teaching, hypothesis, when, fluent, readers, practice, decoding, words, while, reading, silently, they, learn, what, whole, words, look, like, spelling, leading, to, improved, fluency, and, comprehension, the, suggestion, is, if, some, students, are, fluent, readers, they, could, read, silently, while, the, teacher, works, with, the, struggling, readers, languages, such, as, chinese, and, japanese, are, normally, written, fully, or, partly, in, logograms, hanzi, and, kanji, respectively, which, represent, a, whole, word, or, morpheme, with, a, single, character, there, are, a, large, number, of, characters, and, the, sound, that, each, makes, must, be, learned, directly, or, from, other, characters, that, contain, hints, in, them, for, example, in, japanese, the, on, reading, of, the, kanji, is, min, and, the, related, kanji, shares, the, same, on, reading, min, the, right, hand, part, shows, the, character, s, pronunciation, however, this, is, not, true, for, all, characters, kun, readings, on, the, other, hand, have, to, be, learned, and, memorized, as, there, is, no, way, to, tell, from, each, character, ruby, characters, are, used, in, textbooks, to, help, children, learn, the, sounds, that, each, logogram, makes, these, are, written, in, a, smaller, size, using, an, alphabetic, or, syllabic, script, for, example, hiragana, is, typically, used, in, japanese, and, the, pinyin, romanization, into, latin, alphabet, characters, is, used, in, chinese, the, examples, above, each, spell, the, word, kanji, which, is, made, up, of, two, kanji, characters, kan, written, in, hiragana, as, and, ji, written, in, hiragana, as, textbooks, are, sometimes, edited, as, a, cohesive, set, across, grades, so, that, children, will, not, encounter, characters, they, are, not, yet, expected, to, have, learned, for, decades, the, merits, of, phonics, vs, whole, language, have, been, debated, it, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, reading, wars, phonics, was, a, popular, way, to, learn, reading, in, the, 19th, century, william, holmes, mcguffey, 1800, 1873, an, american, educator, author, and, presbyterian, minister, who, had, a, lifelong, interest, in, teaching, children, compiled, the, first, four, of, the, mcguffey, readers, in, 1836, in, 1841, horace, mann, the, secretary, of, the, massachusetts, board, of, education, advocated, for, a, whole, word, method, of, teaching, reading, to, replace, phonics, others, advocated, for, a, return, to, phonics, such, as, rudolf, flesch, in, his, book, why, johnny, can, t, read, 1955, the, whole, word, method, received, support, from, kenneth, j, goodman, who, wrote, an, article, in, 1967, entitled, reading, a, psycholinguistic, guessing, game, in, it, he, says, efficient, reading, is, the, result, of, the, skill, in, selecting, the, fewest, most, productive, cues, necessary, to, produce, guesses, which, are, right, the, first, time, although, not, supported, by, scientific, studies, the, theory, became, very, influential, as, the, whole, language, method, since, the, 1970s, some, whole, language, supporters, such, as, frank, smith, are, unyielding, in, arguing, that, phonics, should, be, taught, little, if, at, all, yet, other, researchers, say, instruction, in, phonics, and, phonemic, awareness, are, critically, important, and, essential, to, developing, early, reading, skills, in, 2000, the, national, reading, panel, u, s, identified, five, ingredients, of, effective, reading, instruction, of, which, phonics, is, one, the, other, four, are, phonemic, awareness, fluency, vocabulary, and, comprehension, reports, from, other, countries, such, as, the, australian, report, on, teaching, reading, 2005, and, the, u, k, independent, review, of, the, teaching, of, early, reading, rose, report, 2006, have, also, supported, the, use, of, phonics, some, notable, researchers, such, as, stanislas, dehaene, and, mark, seidenberg, have, clearly, stated, their, disapproval, of, whole, language, furthermore, a, 2017, study, in, the, uk, that, compared, teaching, with, phonics, vs, teaching, whole, written, words, concluded, that, phonics, is, more, effective, saying, our, findings, suggest, that, interventions, aiming, to, improve, the, accuracy, of, reading, aloud, and, or, comprehension, in, the, early, stages, of, learning, should, focus, on, the, systematicity, present, in, print, to, sound, relationships, rather, than, attempting, to, teach, direct, access, to, the, meanings, of, whole, written, words, more, recently, some, educators, have, advocated, for, the, theory, of, balanced, literacy, purported, to, combine, phonics, and, whole, language, yet, not, necessarily, consistently, or, systematically, it, may, include, elements, such, as, word, study, and, phonics, mini, lessons, differentiated, learning, cueing, leveled, reading, shared, reading, guided, reading, independent, reading, and, sight, words, according, to, a, survey, in, 2010, 68, of, k, 2, teachers, in, the, united, states, practice, balanced, literacy, however, only, 52, of, teachers, included, phonics, in, their, definition, of, balanced, literacy, in, addition, 75, of, teachers, teach, the, three, cueing, system, i, e, meaning, structure, visual, or, semantic, syntactic, graphophonic, that, has, its, roots, in, whole, language, in, addition, some, phonics, supporters, assert, that, balanced, literacy, is, merely, whole, language, by, another, name, and, critics, of, whole, language, and, sceptics, of, balanced, literacy, such, as, neuroscientist, mark, seidenberg, state, that, struggling, readers, should, not, be, encouraged, to, skip, words, they, find, puzzling, or, rely, on, semantic, and, syntactic, cues, to, guess, words, over, time, a, growing, number, of, countries, and, states, have, put, greater, emphasis, on, phonics, and, other, evidence, based, practices, see, phonics, practices, by, country, or, region, according, to, the, report, by, the, us, national, reading, panel, nrp, in, 2000, the, elements, required, for, proficient, reading, of, alphabetic, languages, are, phonemic, awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and, text, comprehension, in, non, latin, languages, proficient, reading, does, not, necessarily, require, phonemic, awareness, but, rather, an, awareness, of, the, individual, parts, of, speech, which, may, also, include, the, whole, word, as, in, chinese, characters, or, syllables, as, in, japanese, as, well, as, others, depending, on, the, writing, system, being, employed, the, rose, report, from, the, department, for, education, in, england, makes, it, clear, that, in, their, view, systematic, phonics, specifically, synthetic, phonics, is, the, best, way, to, ensure, that, children, learn, to, read, such, that, it, is, now, the, law, in, 2005, the, government, of, australia, published, a, report, stating, the, evidence, is, clear, that, direct, systematic, instruction, in, phonics, during, the, early, years, of, schooling, is, an, essential, foundation, for, teaching, children, to, read, phonics, has, been, gaining, acceptance, in, many, other, countries, as, can, be, seen, from, this, page,

age, of, enlightenment, initially, promoted, the, virtue, of, reading, writing, was, still, considered, a, superior, activity, due, to, a, belief, among, social, elites, that, writing, was, constructive, and, a, sign, of, social, initiative, while, reading, was, straightforward, consumption, of, what, had, already, made, as, such, readers, were, passive, citizens, before, the, mid, 18th, century, children, s, books, in, england, usually, focused, on, instruction, or, religious, themes, over, time, a, greater, number, of, books, were, written, with, the, intent, of, delighting, children, for, example, children, s, novels, became, increasingly, popular, over, the, 18th, century, by, 1800, the, area, of, children, s, literature, was, flourishing, with, perhaps, as, many, as, 50, books, being, printed, every, year, in, major, cities, in, 18th, century, europe, some, considered, the, then, new, practice, of, reading, alone, in, bed, to, be, dangerous, and, immoral, for, a, time, as, reading, became, a, less, communal, largely, silent, activity, some, raised, concerns, that, reading, in, bed, presented, various, dangers, such, as, fires, caused, by, bedside, candles, of, people, reading, before, sleep, some, modern, critics, speculate, that, these, concerns, were, rooted, partially, in, fear, that, readers, especially, women, readers, would, shirk, their, obligations, to, their, family, and, community, and, even, transgress, moral, boundaries, via, the, private, fantasy, afforded, by, books, also, during, the, 18th, century, in, england, reading, novels, was, often, criticized, as, a, time, wasting, pastime, when, contrasted, with, the, cultural, seriousness, carried, by, reading, history, classical, literature, or, poetry, chapbooks, were, small, cheap, forms, of, literature, for, children, and, adults, that, were, sold, on, the, streets, and, covered, a, range, of, subjects, such, as, ghost, stories, crime, fantasy, politics, and, disaster, updates, they, provided, simple, reading, matter, and, were, commonplace, across, england, from, the, 17th, to, the, 19th, century, they, are, known, to, have, been, passed, down, through, the, generations, their, readership, would, have, been, largely, among, the, poor, and, among, children, of, the, middle, class, reading, became, even, more, pronounced, in, the, 19th, century, with, public, notes, broadsides, catchpennies, and, printed, songs, becoming, common, street, literature, it, informed, and, entertained, the, public, before, newspapers, became, readily, available, advertisements, and, local, news, such, as, offers, of, rewards, for, catching, criminals, or, for, the, return, of, stolen, goods, appeared, on, public, notices, and, handbills, while, cheaply, printed, sheets,

printing, and, paper, production, and, new, distribution, networks, enabled, by, improved, roads, and, rail, helped, push, an, increased, demand, for, printed, reading, matter, besides, this, social, and, educational, changes, such, as, wider, schooling, rates, along, with, increasing, literacy, rates, particularly, among, the, middle, and, working, classes, helped, boost, a, new, mass, market, for, printed, material, the, arrival, of, gas, and, electric, lighting, in, private, homes, meant, that, reading, after, dark, no, longer, had, to, take, place, by, oil, lamp, or, candlelight, in, 19th, century, russia, reading, practices, were, highly, varied, as, people, from, a, wide, range, of, social, statuses, read, russian, and, foreign, language, texts, ranging, from, high, literature, to, the, peasant, lubok, provincial, readers, such, as, andrei, chikhachev, give, evidence, of, the, omnivorous, appetite, for, fiction, and, non, fiction, alike, among, middling, landowners, the, history, of, learning, to, read, dates, back, to, the, invention, of, writing, during, the, 4th, millennium, bc, concerning, the, english, language, in, the, united, states, the, phonics, principle, of, teaching, reading, was, first, presented, by, john, hart, in, 1570, who, suggested, the, teaching, of, reading, should, focus, on, the, relationship, between, what, is, now, referred, to, as, graphemes, letters, and, phonemes, sounds, in, the, colonial, times, of, the, united, states, reading, material, was, not, written, specifically, for, children, so, instruction, material, consisted, primarily, of, the, bible, and, some, patriotic, essays, the, most, influential, early, textbook, was, the, new, england, primer, published, in, 1687, there, was, little, consideration, given, to, the, best, ways, to, teach, reading, or, assess, reading, comprehension, phonics, was, a, popular, way, to, learn, reading, in, the, 1800s, william, holmes, mcguffey, 1800, 1873, an, american, educator, author, and, presbyterian, minister, who, had, a, lifelong, interest, in, teaching, children, compiled, the, first, four, of, the, mcguffey, readers, in, 1836, the, whole, word, method, was, introduced, into, the, english, speaking, world, by, thomas, hopkins, gallaudet, the, director, of, the, american, school, for, the, deaf, it, was, designed, to, educate, deaf, people, by, placing, a, word, alongside, a, picture, in, 1830, gallaudet, described, his, method, of, teaching, children, to, recognize, a, total, of, 50, sight, words, written, on, cards, horace, mann, the, secretary, of, the, board, of, education, of, massachusetts, u, s, favored, the, method, for, everyone, and, by, 1837, the, method, was, adopted, by, the, boston, primary, school, committee, by, 1844, the, defects, of, the, whole, word, method, became, so, apparent, to, boston, schoolmasters, that, they, urged, the, board, to, return, to, phonics, in, 1929, samuel, orton, a, neuropathologist, in, iowa, concluded, that, the, cause, of, children, s, reading, problems, was, the, new, sight, method, of, reading, his, findings, were, published, in, the, february, 1929, issue, of, the, journal, of, educational, psychology, in, the, article, the, sight, reading, method, of, teaching, reading, as, a, source, of, reading, disability, the, meaning, based, curriculum, came, to, dominate, reading, instruction, by, the, second, quarter, of, the, 20th, century, in, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, reading, programs, became, very, focused, on, comprehension, and, taught, children, to, read, whole, words, by, sight, phonics, was, taught, as, a, last, resort, edward, william, dolch, developed, his, list, of, sight, words, in, 1936, by, studying, the, most, frequently, occurring, words, in, children, s, books, of, that, era, children, are, encouraged, to, memorize, the, words, with, the, idea, that, it, will, help, them, read, more, fluently, many, teachers, continue, to, use, this, list, although, some, researchers, consider, the, theory, of, sight, word, reading, to, be, a, myth, researchers, and, literacy, organizations, suggest, it, would, be, more, effective, if, students, learned, the, words, using, a, phonics, approach, in, 1955, rudolf, flesch, published, a, book, entitled, why, johnny, can, t, read, a, passionate, argument, in, favor, of, teaching, children, to, read, using, phonics, adding, to, the, reading, debate, among, educators, researchers, and, parents, government, funded, research, on, reading, instruction, in, the, united, states, and, elsewhere, began, in, the, 1960s, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, researchers, began, publishing, studies, with, evidence, on, the, effectiveness, of, different, instructional, approaches, during, this, time, researchers, at, the, national, institutes, of, health, nih, conducted, studies, that, showed, early, reading, acquisition, depends, on, the, understanding, of, the, connection, between, sounds, and, letters, i, e, phonics, however, this, appears, to, have, had, little, effect, on, educational, practices, in, public, schools, in, the, 1970s, the, whole, language, method, was, introduced, this, method, de, emphasizes, the, teaching, of, phonics, out, of, context, e, g, reading, books, and, is, intended, to, help, readers, guess, the, right, word, it, teaches, that, guessing, individual, words, should, involve, three, systems, letter, clues, meaning, clues, from, context, and, the, syntactical, structure, of, the, sentence, it, became, the, primary, method, of, reading, instruction, in, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, however, it, is, falling, out, of, favor, the, neuroscientist, mark, seidenberg, refers, to, it, as, a, theoretical, zombie, because, it, persists, despite, a, lack, of, supporting, evidence, it, is, still, widely, practiced, in, related, methods, such, as, sight, words, the, three, cueing, system, and, balanced, literacy, in, the, 1980s, the, three, cueing, system, the, searchlights, model, in, england, emerged, according, to, a, 2010, survey, 75, of, teachers, in, the, united, states, teach, the, three, cueing, system, it, teaches, children, to, guess, a, word, by, using, meaning, cues, semantic, syntactic, and, graphophonic, while, the, system, does, help, students, to, make, better, guesses, it, does, not, help, when, the, words, become, more, sophisticated, and, it, reduces, the, amount, of, practice, time, available, to, learn, essential, decoding, skills, consequently, present, day, researchers, such, as, cognitive, neuroscientists, mark, seidenberg, and, professor, timothy, shanahan, do, not, support, the, theory, in, england, synthetic, phonics, is, intended, to, replace, the, searchlights, multi, cueing, model, in, the, 1990s, balanced, literacy, arose, it, is, a, theory, of, teaching, reading, and, writing, that, is, not, clearly, defined, it, may, include, elements, such, as, word, study, and, phonics, mini, lessons, differentiated, learning, cueing, leveled, reading, shared, reading, guided, reading, independent, reading, and, sight, words, for, some, balanced, literacy, strikes, a, balance, between, whole, language, and, phonics, others, say, balanced, literacy, in, practice, usually, means, the, whole, language, approach, to, reading, according, to, a, survey, in, 2010, 68, of, k, 2, teachers, in, the, united, states, practice, balanced, literacy, furthermore, only, 52, of, teachers, included, phonics, in, their, definition, of, balanced, literacy, in, 1996, the, california, department, of, education, took, an, increased, interest, in, using, phonics, in, schools, and, in, 1997, the, department, called, for, grade, one, teaching, in, concepts, about, print, phonemic, awareness, decoding, and, word, recognition, and, vocabulary, and, concept, development, by, 1998, in, the, u, k, whole, language, instruction, and, the, searchlights, model, were, still, the, norm, however, there, was, some, attention, to, teaching, phonics, in, the, early, grades, as, seen, in, the, national, literacy, strategies, beginning, in, 2000, several, reading, research, reports, were, published, in, australia, the, 2005, report, teaching, reading, recommends, teaching, reading, based, on, evidence, and, teaching, systematic, explicit, phonics, within, an, integrated, approach, the, executive, summary, says, systematic, phonics, instruction, is, critical, if, children, are, to, be, taught, to, read, well, whether, or, not, they, experience, reading, difficulties, as, of, october, 5, 2018, the, state, government, of, victoria, australia, publishes, a, website, containing, a, comprehensive, literacy, teaching, toolkit, including, effective, reading, instruction, phonics, and, sample, phonics, lessons, in, scotland, a, seven, year, study, the, clackmannanshire, report, was, published, in, 2005, it, compared, analytic, phonics, with, synthetic, phonics, and, advantaged, students, with, disadvantaged, students, the, report, found, that, using, synthetic, phonics, children, from, lower, socio, economic, backgrounds, performed, at, the, same, level, as, children, from, advantaged, backgrounds, in, primary, school, whereas, with, analytic, phonics, teaching, they, did, significantly, less, well, and, boys, performed, better, than, or, as, well, as, girls, a, five, year, follow, up, of, the, study, concluded, that, the, beneficial, effects, were, long, lasting, in, fact, the, reading, gains, increased, subsequently, education, scotland, concluded, that, explicit, systematic, phonics, programs, usually, embedded, in, a, rich, literacy, environment, give, an, additional, four, months, progress, over, other, programs, such, as, whole, language, and, are, particularly, beneficial, for, young, learners, aged, 4, 7, there, is, evidence, though, less, secure, that, synthetic, phonics, programs, may, be, more, beneficial, than, analytic, phonics, programs, however, it, is, most, important, to, teach, systematically, until, 2006, the, english, language, syllabus, of, singapore, advocated, a, balance, between, decoding, and, meaning, based, instruction, phonics, and, whole, language, however, a, review, in, 2006, advocated, for, a, systematic, approach, subsequently, the, syllabus, in, 2010, had, no, mention, of, whole, language, and, advocated, for, a, balance, between, systematic, and, explicit, instruction, and, a, rich, language, environment, it, called, for, increased, instruction, in, oral, language, skills, together, with, phonemic, awareness, and, the, key, decoding, elements, of, synthetic, phonics, analytic, phonics, and, analogy, phonics, in, 2007, the, department, of, education, de, in, northern, ireland, was, required, by, law, to, teach, children, foundational, skills, in, phonological, awareness, and, the, understanding, that, words, are, made, up, of, sounds, and, syllables, and, that, sounds, are, represented, by, letters, phoneme, grapheme, awareness, in, 2010, the, de, required, that, teachers, receive, support, in, using, evidence, based, practices, to, teach, literacy, and, numeracy, including, a, systematic, programme, of, high, quality, phonics, that, is, explicit, structured, well, paced, interactive, engaging, and, applied, in, a, meaningful, context, in, 2008, the, national, center, for, family, literacy, with, the, national, institute, for, literacy, published, a, report, entitled, developing, early, literacy, it, is, a, synthesis, of, the, scientific, research, on, the,

report, concluded, that, code, focused, interventions, on, the, early, literacy, and, conventional, literacy, skills, of, young, children, yield, a, moderate, to, large, effect, on, the, predictors, of, later, reading, and, writing, irrespective, of, socioeconomic, status, ethnicity, or, population, density, in, 2010, the, common, core, state, standards, initiative, was, introduced, in, the,

is, preceded, by, training, in, phonological, awareness, in, 2014, the, california, department, of, education, said, children, should, know, how, to, decode, regularly, spelled, one, syllable, words, by, mid, first, grade, and, be, phonemically, aware, especially, able, to, segment, and, blend, phonemes, in, grades, two, and, three, children, receive, explicit, instruction, in, advanced, phonic, analysis, and, reading, multi, syllabic, and, more, complex, words, in, 2015, the, new, york, state, public, school, system, revised, its, english, language, arts, learning, standards, calling, for,

comprehend, up, to, half, of, the, printed, fourth, grade, curriculum, furthermore, it, says, a, gap, exists, between, what, is, known, about, how, to, teach, reading, and, how, teachers, can, teach, reading, it, goes, on, to, say, that, teachers, preparation, programs, must, include, evidence, based, practices, including, the, five, essential, components, of, reading, instruction, phonemic,

essential, human, right, the, ohrc, s, report, deals, with, all, students, not, just, those, with, learning, disabilities, the, inquiry, found, that, ontario, is, not, fulfilling, its, obligations, to, meet, students, right, to, read, specifically, foundational, word, reading, skills, are, not, effectively, targeted, in, ontario, s, education, system, with, science, based, approaches, to, reading, instruction, early, screening, and, intervention, we, should, see, only, about, 5, of, students, reading, below, grade, level, however, in, 2018, 2019, 26, of, all, ontario, grade, 3, students, and, 53, of, grade, 3, students, with, special, education, needs, students, who, have, an, individual, education, plan, were, not, meeting, the, provincial, eqao, standard, the, results, improved, only, slightly, for, grade, 6, students, where, 19, of, all, students, and, 47, of, students, with, special, education, needs, did, not, meet, the, provincial, standard, the, ontario, curriculum, encourages, the, use, of, the, three, cueing, system, and, balanced, literacy, which, are, ineffective, because, they, teach, children, to, guess, the, meaning, of, a, word, rather, than, sound, it, out, what, is, required, is, a, evidence, based, curriculum, and, instruction, including, explicit, and, systematic, instruction, in, phonemic, awareness, and, phonics, b, evidence, based, screening, assessments, c, evidence, based, reading, interventions, d, accommodations, that, are, not, used, as, a, substitute, for, teaching, students, to, read, and, e, professional, assessments, yet, not, required, for, interventions, or, accommodations, the, minister, of, education, for, ontario, responded, to, this, report, by, saying, the, government, is, taking, immediate, action, to,

estimates, were, significant, and, negative, the, study, found, that, children, who, received, reading, recovery, had, scores, on, state, reading, tests, in, third, and, fourth, grade, that, were, below, the, test, scores, of, similar, children, who, did, not, receive, reading, recovery, it, suggests, three, possible, hypotheses, for, this, outcome, 1, while, reading, recovery, produces, large, impacts, on, early, literacy, measures, it, does, not, give, students, the, required, skills, for, success, in, later, grades, or, 2, the, gains, are, lost, because, students, do, not, receive, sufficient, intervention, in, later, grades, or, 3, the, impacts, of, the, early, intervention, was, washed, out, by, subsequent, experiences, between, 2013, and, 2022, 30, states, have, passed, laws,
