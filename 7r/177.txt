of, this, problem, is, becoming, increasingly, recognized, and, support, systems, are, being, put, into, place, stress, sometimes, affects, students, more, severely, than, teachers, up, to, the, point, where, the, students, are, prescribed, stress, medication, this, stress, is, claimed, to, be, related, to, standardized, testing, and, the, pressure, on, students, to, score, above, average, according, to, a, 2008, mental, health, study, by, the, associated, press, and, mtvu, eight, in, 10, u, s, college, students, said, they, had, sometimes, or, frequently, experienced, stress, in,

always, been, under, pressure, for, instance, pressure, to, cover, the, curriculum, perform, well, compared, to, other, schools, and, avoid, the, stigma, of, being, soft, or, spoiling, toward, students, forms, of, discipline, such, as, control, over, when, students, may, speak, and, normalized, behaviour, such, as, raising, a, hand, to, speak, are, imposed, in, the, name, of, greater, efficiency, practitioners, of, critical, pedagogy, maintain, that, such, disciplinary, measures, have, no, positive, effect, on, student, learning, indeed, some, argue, that, disciplinary, practices, detract, from, learning, saying, that, they, undermine, students, dignity, and, sense, of, self, worth, the, latter, occupying, a, more, primary, role, in, students, hierarchy, of, needs, this,
