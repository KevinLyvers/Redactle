morse, code, is, a, telecommunications, method, which, encodes, text, characters, as, standardized, sequences, of, two, different, signal, durations, called, dots, and, dashes, or, dits, and, dahs, morse, code, is, named, after, samuel, morse, one, of, the, early, developers, of, the, system, adopted, for, electrical, telegraphy, international, morse, code, encodes, the, 26, basic, latin, letters, a, to, z, one, accented, latin, letter, the, arabic, numerals, and, a, small, set, of, punctuation, and, procedural, signals, prosigns, there, is, no, distinction, between, upper, and, lower, case, letters, each, morse, code, symbol, is, formed, by, a, sequence, of, dits, and, dahs, the, dit, duration, can, vary, for, signal, clarity, and, operator, skill, but, for, any, one, message, once, established, it, is, the, basic, unit, of, time, measurement, in, morse, code, the, duration, of, a, dah, is, three, times, the, duration, of, a, dit, although, some, telegraphers, deliberately, exaggerate, the, length, of, a, dah, for, clearer, signalling, each, dit, or, dah, within, an, encoded, character, is, followed, by, a, period, of, signal, absence, called, a, space, equal, to, the, dit, duration, the, letters, of, a, word, are, separated, by, a, space, of, duration, equal, to, three, dits, and, words, are, separated, by, a, space, equal, to, seven, dits, morse, code, can, be, memorized, and, sent, in, a, form, perceptible, to, the, human, senses, e, g, via, sound, waves, or, visible, light, such, that, it, can, be, directly, interpreted, by, persons, trained, in, the, skill, morse, code, is, usually, transmitted, by, on, off, keying, of, an, information, carrying, medium, such, as, electric, current, radio, waves, visible, light, or, sound, waves, the, current, or, wave, is, present, during, the, time, period, of, the, dit, or, dah, and, absent, during, the, time, between, dits, and, dahs, since, many, natural, languages, use, more, than, the, 26, letters, of, the, latin, alphabet, morse, alphabets, have, been, developed, for, those, languages, largely, by, transliteration, of, existing, codes, to, increase, the, efficiency, of, transmission, morse, code, was, originally, designed, so, that, the, duration, of, each, symbol, is, approximately, inverse, to, the, frequency, of, occurrence, of, the, character, that, it, represents, in, text, of, the, english, language, thus, the, most, common, letter, in, english, the, letter, e, has, the, shortest, code, a, single, dit, because, the, morse, code, elements, are, specified, by, proportion, rather, than, specific, time, durations, the, code, is, usually, transmitted, at, the, highest, rate, that, the, receiver, is, capable, of, decoding, morse, code, transmission, rate, speed, is, specified, in, groups, per, minute, commonly, referred, to, as, words, per, minute, early, in, the, nineteenth, century, european, experimenters, made, progress, with, electrical, signaling, systems, using, a, variety, of, techniques, including, static, electricity, and, electricity, from, voltaic, piles, producing, electrochemical, and, electromagnetic, changes, these, experimental, designs, were, precursors, to, practical, telegraphic, applications, following, the, discovery, of, electromagnetism, by, hans, christian, rsted, in, 1820, and, the, invention, of, the, electromagnet, by, william, sturgeon, in, 1824, there, were, developments, in, electromagnetic, telegraphy, in, europe, and, america, pulses, of, electric, current, were, sent, along, wires, to, control, an, electromagnet, in, the, receiving, instrument, many, of, the, earliest, telegraph, systems, used, a, single, needle, system, which, gave, a, very, simple, and, robust, instrument, however, it, was, slow, as, the, receiving, operator, had, to, alternate, between, looking, at, the, needle, and, writing, down, the, message, in, morse, code, a, deflection, of, the, needle, to, the, left, corresponded, to, a, dit, and, a, deflection, to, the, right, to, a, dah, the, needle, clicked, each, time, it, moved, to, the, right, or, left, by, making, the, two, clicks, sound, different, by, installing, one, ivory, and, one, metal, stop, transmissions, on, the, single, needle, device, became, audible, as, well, as, visible, which, led, in, turn, to, the, double, plate, sounder, system, william, cooke, and, charles, wheatstone, in, britain, developed, an, electrical, telegraph, that, used, electromagnets, in, its, receivers, they, obtained, an, english, patent, in, june, 1837, and, demonstrated, it, on, the, london, and, birmingham, railway, making, it, the, first, commercial, telegraph, carl, friedrich, gauss, and, wilhelm, eduard, weber, 1833, as, well, as, carl, august, von, steinheil, 1837, used, codes, with, varying, word, lengths, for, their, telegraph, systems, in, 1841, cooke, and, wheatstone, built, a, telegraph, that, printed, the, letters, from, a, wheel, of, typefaces, struck, by, a, hammer, 79, the, american, artist, samuel, morse, the, american, physicist, joseph, henry, and, mechanical, engineer, alfred, vail, developed, an, electrical, telegraph, system, the, simple, on, or, off, nature, of, its, signals, made, it, desirable, to, find, a, method, of, transmitting, natural, language, using, only, electrical, pulses, and, the, silence, between, them, around, 1837, morse, therefore, developed, such, a, method, an, early, forerunner, to, the, modern, international, morse, code, 79, the, morse, system, for, telegraphy, which, was, first, used, in, about, 1844, was, designed, to, make, indentations, on, a, paper, tape, when, electric, currents, were, received, morse, s, original, telegraph, receiver, used, a, mechanical, clockwork, to, move, a, paper, tape, when, an, electrical, current, was, received, an, electromagnet, engaged, an, armature, that, pushed, a, stylus, onto, the, moving, paper, tape, making, an, indentation, on, the, tape, when, the, current, was, interrupted, a, spring, retracted, the, stylus, and, that, portion, of, the, moving, tape, remained, unmarked, morse, code, was, developed, so, that, operators, could, translate, the, indentations, marked, on, the, paper, tape, into, text, messages, in, his, earliest, design, for, a, code, morse, had, planned, to, transmit, only, numerals, and, to, use, a, codebook, to, look, up, each, word, according, to, the, number, which, had, been, sent, however, the, code, was, soon, expanded, by, alfred, vail, in, 1840, to, include, letters, and, special, characters, so, it, could, be, used, more, generally, vail, estimated, the, frequency, of, use, of, letters, in, the, english, language, by, counting, the, movable, type, he, found, in, the, type, cases, of, a, local, newspaper, in, morristown, new, jersey, 84, the, shorter, marks, were, called, dots, and, the, longer, ones, dashes, and, the, letters, most, commonly, used, were, assigned, the, shortest, sequences, of, dots, and, dashes, this, code, first, used, in, 1844, was, what, later, became, known, as, morse, landline, code, american, morse, code, or, railroad, morse, until, the, end, of, railroad, telegraphy, in, the, u, s, in, the, 1970s, in, the, original, morse, telegraph, system, the, receiver, s, armature, made, a, clicking, noise, as, it, moved, in, and, out, of, position, to, mark, the, paper, tape, early, telegraph, operators, soon, learned, that, they, could, translate, the, clicks, directly, into, dots, and, dashes, and, write, these, down, by, hand, thus, making, the, paper, tape, unnecessary, when, morse, code, was, adapted, to, radio, communication, the, dots, and, dashes, were, sent, as, short, and, long, tone, pulses, later, telegraphy, training, found, that, people, become, more, proficient, at, receiving, morse, code, when, it, is, taught, like, a, language, with, each, code, perceived, as, a, whole, word, instead, of, a, sequence, of, separate, dots, and, dashes, such, as, might, be, shown, on, a, page, with, the, advent, of, tones, produced, by, radiotelegraph, receivers, the, operators, began, to, vocalize, a, dot, as, dit, and, a, dash, as, dah, to, reflect, the, sounds, of, morse, code, they, heard, to, conform, to, normal, sending, speed, dits, which, are, not, the, last, element, of, a, code, became, voiced, as, di, for, example, the, letter, l, is, voiced, as, di, dah, di, dit, morse, code, was, sometimes, facetiously, known, as, iddy, umpty, a, dit, lampooned, as, iddy, and, a, dah, as, umpty, leading, to, the, word, umpteen, the, morse, code, as, specified, in, the, current, international, standard, international, morse, code, recommendation, itu, r, m, 1677, 1, was, derived, from, a, much, improved, proposal, by, friedrich, gerke, in, 1848, that, became, known, as, the, hamburg, alphabet, its, only, real, defect, being, the, use, of, an, excessively, long, code, and, later, the, equal, duration, code, for, the, frequently, used, vowel, o, gerke, changed, many, of, the, codepoints, in, the, process, doing, away, with, the, different, length, dashes, and, different, inter, element, spaces, of, american, morse, leaving, only, two, coding, elements, the, dot, and, the, dash, codes, for, german, umlauted, vowels, and, ch, were, introduced, gerke, s, code, was, adopted, in, germany, and, austria, in, 1851, this, finally, led, to, the, international, morse, code, in, 1865, the, international, morse, code, adopted, most, of, gerke, s, codepoints, the, codes, for, o, and, p, were, taken, from, a, code, system, developed, by, steinheil, a, new, codepoint, was, added, for, j, since, gerke, did, not, distinguish, between, i, and, j, changes, were, also, made, to, x, y, and, z, this, left, only, four, codepoints, identical, to, the, original, morse, code, namely, e, h, k, and, n, and, the, latter, two, had, their, dahs, extended, to, full, length, the, original, american, code, being, compared, dates, to, 1838, the, later, american, code, shown, in, the, table, was, developed, in, 1844, in, the, 1890s, morse, code, began, to, be, used, extensively, for, early, radio, communication, before, it, was, possible, to, transmit, voice, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, most, high, speed, international, communication, used, morse, code, on, telegraph, lines, undersea, cables, and, radio, circuits, although, previous, transmitters, were, bulky, and, the, spark, gap, system, of, transmission, was, dangerous, and, difficult, to, use, there, had, been, some, early, attempts, in, 1910, the, u, s, navy, experimented, with, sending, morse, from, an, airplane, however, the, first, regular, aviation, radiotelegraphy, was, on, airships, which, had, space, to, accommodate, the, large, heavy, radio, equipment, then, in, use, the, same, year, 1910, a, radio, on, the, airship, america, was, instrumental, in, coordinating, the, rescue, of, its, crew, during, world, war, i, zeppelin, airships, equipped, with, radio, were, used, for, bombing, and, naval, scouting, and, ground, based, radio, direction, finders, were, used, for, airship, navigation, allied, airships, and, military, aircraft, also, made, some, use, of, radiotelegraphy, however, there, was, little, aeronautical, radio, in, general, use, during, world, war, i, and, in, the, 1920s, there, was, no, radio, system, used, by, such, important, flights, as, that, of, charles, lindbergh, from, new, york, to, paris, in, 1927, once, he, and, the, spirit, of, st, louis, were, off, the, ground, lindbergh, was, truly, incommunicado, and, alone, morse, code, in, aviation, began, regular, use, in, the, mid, 1920s, by, 1928, when, the, first, airplane, flight, was, made, by, the, southern, cross, from, california, to, australia, one, of, its, four, crewmen, was, a, radio, operator, who, communicated, with, ground, stations, via, radio, telegraph, beginning, in, the, 1930s, both, civilian, and, military, pilots, were, required, to, be, able, to, use, morse, code, both, for, use, with, early, communications, systems, and, for, identification, of, navigational, beacons, that, transmitted, continuous, two, or, three, letter, identifiers, in, morse, code, aeronautical, charts, show, the, identifier, of, each, navigational, aid, next, to, its, location, on, the, map, in, addition, rapidly, moving, field, armies, could, not, have, fought, effectively, without, radiotelegraphy, they, moved, more, quickly, than, their, communications, services, could, put, up, new, telegraph, and, telephone, lines, this, was, seen, especially, in, the, blitzkrieg, offensives, of, the, nazi, german, wehrmacht, in, poland, belgium, france, in, 1940, the, soviet, union, and, in, north, africa, by, the, british, army, in, north, africa, italy, and, the, netherlands, and, by, the, u, s, army, in, france, and, belgium, in, 1944, and, in, southern, germany, in, 1945, radiotelegraphy, using, morse, code, was, vital, during, world, war, ii, especially, in, carrying, messages, between, the, warships, and, the, naval, bases, of, the, belligerents, long, range, ship, to, ship, communication, was, by, radio, telegraphy, using, encrypted, messages, because, the, voice, radio, systems, on, ships, then, were, quite, limited, in, both, their, range, and, their, security, radiotelegraphy, was, also, extensively, used, by, warplanes, especially, by, long, range, patrol, planes, that, were, sent, out, by, those, navies, to, scout, for, enemy, warships, cargo, ships, and, troop, ships, morse, code, was, used, as, an, international, standard, for, maritime, distress, until, 1999, when, it, was, replaced, by, the, global, maritime, distress, and, safety, system, when, the, french, navy, ceased, using, morse, code, on, january, 31, 1997, the, final, message, transmitted, was, calling, all, this, is, our, last, call, before, our, eternal, silence, in, the, united, states, the, final, commercial, morse, code, transmission, was, on, july, 12, 1999, signing, off, with, samuel, morse, s, original, 1844, message, what, hath, god, wrought, and, the, prosign, sk, end, of, contact, as, of, 2015, the, united, states, air, force, still, trains, ten, people, a, year, in, morse, the, united, states, coast, guard, has, ceased, all, use, of, morse, code, on, the, radio, and, no, longer, monitors, any, radio, frequencies, for, morse, code, transmissions, including, the, international, medium, frequency, mf, distress, frequency, of, 500, khz, however, the, federal, communications, commission, still, grants, commercial, radiotelegraph, operator, licenses, to, applicants, who, pass, its, code, and, written, tests, licensees, have, reactivated, the, old, california, coastal, morse, station, kph, and, regularly, transmit, from, the, site, under, either, this, call, sign, or, as, ksm, similarly, a, few, u, s, museum, ship, stations, are, operated, by, morse, enthusiasts, morse, code, speed, is, measured, in, words, per, minute, wpm, or, characters, per, minute, cpm, characters, have, differing, lengths, because, they, contain, differing, numbers, of, dits, and, dahs, consequently, words, also, have, different, lengths, in, terms, of, dot, duration, even, when, they, contain, the, same, number, of, characters, for, this, reason, some, standard, word, is, adopted, for, measuring, operators, transmission, speeds, two, such, standard, words, in, common, use, are, paris, and, codex, operators, skilled, in, morse, code, can, often, understand, copy, code, in, their, heads, at, rates, in, excess, of, 40, wpm, in, addition, to, knowing, understanding, and, being, able, to, copy, the, standard, written, alpha, numeric, and, punctuation, characters, or, symbols, at, high, speeds, skilled, high, speed, operators, must, also, be, fully, knowledgeable, of, all, of, the, special, unwritten, morse, code, symbols, for, the, standard, prosigns, for, morse, code, and, the, meanings, of, these, special, procedural, signals, in, standard, morse, code, communications, protocol, international, contests, in, code, copying, are, still, occasionally, held, in, july, 1939, at, a, contest, in, asheville, north, carolina, in, the, united, states, ted, r, mcelroy, w1jyn, set, a, still, standing, record, for, morse, copying, 75, 2, wpm, pierpont, 2004, also, notes, that, some, operators, may, have, passed, 100, wpm, by, this, time, they, are, hearing, phrases, and, sentences, rather, than, words, the, fastest, speed, ever, sent, by, a, straight, key, was, achieved, in, 1942, by, harry, turner, w9yze, d, 1992, who, reached, 35, wpm, in, a, demonstration, at, a, u, s, army, base, to, accurately, compare, code, copying, speed, records, of, different, eras, it, is, useful, to, keep, in, mind, that, different, standard, words, 50, dit, durations, versus, 60, dit, durations, and, different, interword, gaps, 5, dit, durations, versus, 7, dit, durations, may, have, been, used, when, determining, such, speed, records, for, example, speeds, run, with, the, codex, standard, word, and, the, paris, standard, may, differ, by, up, to, 20, today, among, amateur, operators, there, are, several, organizations, that, recognize, high, speed, code, ability, one, group, consisting, of, those, who, can, copy, morse, at, 60, wpm, also, certificates, of, code, proficiency, are, issued, by, several, amateur, radio, societies, including, the, american, radio, relay, league, their, basic, award, starts, at, 10, wpm, with, endorsements, as, high, as, 40, wpm, and, are, available, to, anyone, who, can, copy, the, transmitted, text, members, of, the, boy, scouts, of, america, may, put, a, morse, interpreter, s, strip, on, their, uniforms, if, they, meet, the, standards, for, translating, code, at, 5, wpm, through, may, 2013, the, first, second, and, third, class, commercial, radiotelegraph, licenses, using, code, tests, based, upon, the, codex, standard, word, were, still, being, issued, in, the, united, states, by, the, federal, communications, commission, the, first, class, license, required, 20, wpm, code, group, and, 25, wpm, text, code, proficiency, the, others, 16, wpm, code, group, test, five, letter, blocks, sent, as, simulation, of, receiving, encrypted, text, and, 20, wpm, code, text, plain, language, test, it, was, also, necessary, to, pass, written, tests, on, operating, practice, and, electronics, theory, a, unique, additional, demand, for, the, first, class, was, a, requirement, of, a, year, of, experience, for, operators, of, shipboard, and, coast, stations, using, morse, this, allowed, the, holder, to, be, chief, operator, on, board, a, passenger, ship, however, since, 1999, the, use, of, satellite, and, very, high, frequency, maritime, communications, systems, gmdss, has, made, them, obsolete, by, that, point, meeting, experience, requirement, for, the, first, was, very, difficult, currently, only, one, class, of, license, the, radiotelegraph, operator, license, is, issued, this, is, granted, either, when, the, tests, are, passed, or, as, the, second, and, first, are, renewed, and, become, this, lifetime, license, for, new, applicants, it, requires, passing, a, written, examination, on, electronic, theory, and, radiotelegraphy, practices, as, well, as, 16, wpm, code, group, and, 20, wpm, text, tests, however, the, code, exams, are, currently, waived, for, holders, of, amateur, extra, class, licenses, who, obtained, their, operating, privileges, under, the, old, 20, wpm, test, requirement, morse, codes, of, one, version, or, another, have, been, in, use, for, more, than, 160, years, longer, than, any, other, electrical, message, encoding, system, what, is, called, morse, code, today, is, actually, somewhat, different, from, what, was, originally, developed, by, vail, and, morse, the, modern, international, morse, code, or, continental, code, was, created, by, friedrich, clemens, gerke, in, 1848, and, initially, used, for, telegraphy, between, hamburg, and, cuxhaven, in, germany, gerke, changed, nearly, half, of, the, alphabet, and, all, of, the, numerals, providing, the, foundation, for, the, modern, form, of, the, code, after, some, minor, changes, to, the, letters, and, a, complete, revision, of, the, numerals, international, morse, code, was, standardized, by, the, international, telegraphy, congress, in, 1865, in, paris, and, later, became, the, standard, adopted, by, the, international, telecommunication, union, itu, morse, and, vail, s, final, code, specification, however, was, only, really, used, only, for, land, line, telegraphy, in, the, united, states, and, canada, with, the, international, code, used, everywhere, else, including, all, ships, at, sea, and, sailing, in, north, american, waters, morse, s, version, became, known, as, american, morse, code, or, railroad, code, and, is, now, almost, never, used, with, the, possible, exception, of, historical, re, enactments, in, aviation, pilots, use, radio, navigation, aids, to, allow, pilots, to, ensure, that, the, stations, they, intend, to, use, are, serviceable, the, stations, transmit, a, set, of, identification, letters, usually, a, two, to, five, letter, version, of, the, station, name, in, morse, code, station, identification, letters, are, shown, on, air, navigation, charts, for, example, the, vor, dme, based, at, vilo, acu, a, airport, in, cayo, largo, del, sur, cuba, is, identified, by, ucl, and, morse, code, ucl, is, repeatedly, transmitted, on, its, radio, frequency, in, some, countries, during, periods, of, maintenance, the, facility, may, instead, transmit, the, signal, test, or, the, identification, may, be, removed, which, tells, pilots, and, navigators, that, the, station, is, unreliable, in, canada, the, identification, is, removed, entirely, to, signify, the, navigation, aid, is, not, to, be, used, in, the, aviation, service, morse, is, typically, sent, at, a, very, slow, speed, of, about, 5, words, per, minute, in, the, u, s, pilots, do, not, actually, have, to, know, morse, to, identify, the, transmitter, because, the, dot, dash, sequence, is, written, out, next, to, the, transmitter, s, symbol, on, aeronautical, charts, some, modern, navigation, receivers, automatically, translate, the, code, into, displayed, letters, international, morse, code, today, is, most, popular, among, amateur, radio, operators, in, the, mode, commonly, referred, to, as, continuous, wave, or, cw, other, faster, keying, methods, are, available, in, radio, telegraphy, such, as, frequency, shift, keying, fsk, the, original, amateur, radio, operators, used, morse, code, exclusively, since, voice, capable, radio, transmitters, did, not, become, commonly, available, until, around, 1920, until, 2003, the, international, telecommunication, union, mandated, morse, code, proficiency, as, part, of, the, amateur, radio, licensing, procedure, worldwide, however, the, world, radiocommunication, conference, of, 2003, made, the, morse, code, requirement, for, amateur, radio, licensing, optional, many, countries, subsequently, removed, the, morse, requirement, from, their, license, requirements, until, 1991, a, demonstration, of, the, ability, to, send, and, receive, morse, code, at, a, minimum, of, five, words, per, minute, wpm, was, required, to, receive, an, amateur, radio, license, for, use, in, the, united, states, from, the, federal, communications, commission, demonstration, of, this, ability, was, still, required, for, the, privilege, to, use, the, shortwave, bands, until, 2000, proficiency, at, the, 20, wpm, level, was, required, to, receive, the, highest, level, of, amateur, license, amateur, extra, class, effective, april, 15, 2000, in, the, fcc, reduced, the, extra, class, requirement, to, 5, wpm, finally, effective, on, february, 23, 2007, the, fcc, eliminated, the, morse, code, proficiency, requirements, from, all, amateur, radio, licenses, while, voice, and, data, transmissions, are, limited, to, specific, amateur, radio, bands, under, u, s, rules, morse, code, is, permitted, on, all, amateur, bands, lf, mf, low, mf, high, hf, vhf, and, uhf, in, some, countries, certain, portions, of, the, amateur, radio, bands, are, reserved, for, transmission, of, morse, code, signals, only, because, morse, code, transmissions, employ, an, on, off, keyed, radio, signal, it, requires, less, complex, equipment, than, other, radio, transmission, modes, morse, code, also, uses, less, bandwidth, typically, only, 100, 150, hz, wide, although, only, for, a, slow, data, rate, than, voice, communication, roughly, 2, 400, 2, 800, hz, used, by, ssb, voice, morse, code, is, usually, received, as, a, high, pitched, audio, tone, so, transmissions, are, easier, to, copy, than, voice, through, the, noise, on, congested, frequencies, and, it, can, be, used, in, very, high, noise, low, signal, environments, the, fact, that, the, transmitted, power, is, concentrated, into, a, very, limited, bandwidth, makes, it, possible, to, use, narrow, receiver, filters, which, suppress, or, eliminate, interference, on, nearby, frequencies, the, narrow, signal, bandwidth, also, takes, advantage, of, the, natural, aural, selectivity, of, the, human, brain, further, enhancing, weak, signal, readability, this, efficiency, makes, cw, extremely, useful, for, dx, long, distance, transmissions, as, well, as, for, low, power, transmissions, commonly, called, qrp, operation, from, the, q, code, for, reduce, power, there, are, several, amateur, clubs, that, require, solid, high, speed, copy, the, highest, of, these, has, a, standard, of, 60, wpm, the, american, radio, relay, league, offers, a, code, proficiency, certification, program, that, starts, at, 10, wpm, the, relatively, limited, speed, at, which, morse, code, can, be, sent, led, to, the, development, of, an, extensive, number, of, abbreviations, to, speed, communication, these, include, prosigns, q, codes, and, a, set, of, morse, code, abbreviations, for, typical, message, components, for, example, cq, is, broadcast, to, be, interpreted, as, seek, you, i, d, like, to, converse, with, anyone, who, can, hear, my, signal, the, abbreviations, om, old, man, yl, young, lady, and, xyl, ex, young, lady, wife, are, common, yl, or, om, is, used, by, an, operator, when, referring, to, the, other, operator, regardless, of, their, actual, age, and, xyl, or, om, rather, than, the, expected, xym, is, used, by, an, operator, when, referring, to, his, or, her, spouse, qth, is, transmitting, location, spoken, my, q, t, h, is, my, location, the, use, of, abbreviations, for, common, terms, permits, conversation, even, when, the, operators, speak, different, languages, although, the, traditional, telegraph, key, straight, key, is, still, used, by, some, amateurs, the, use, of, mechanical, semi, automatic, keyers, informally, called, bugs, and, of, fully, automatic, electronic, keyers, called, single, paddle, and, either, double, paddle, or, iambic, keys, is, prevalent, today, software, is, also, frequently, employed, to, produce, and, decode, morse, code, radio, signals, the, arrl, has, a, readability, standard, for, robot, encoders, called, arrl, farnsworth, spacing, that, is, supposed, to, have, higher, readability, for, both, robot, and, human, decoders, some, programs, like, winmorse, have, implemented, the, standard, radio, navigation, aids, such, as, vors, and, ndbs, for, aeronautical, use, broadcast, identifying, information, in, the, form, of, morse, code, though, many, vor, stations, now, also, provide, voice, identification, warships, including, those, of, the, u, s, navy, have, long, used, signal, lamps, to, exchange, messages, in, morse, code, modern, use, continues, in, part, as, a, way, to, communicate, while, maintaining, radio, silence, automatic, transmitter, identification, system, atis, uses, morse, code, to, identify, uplink, sources, of, analog, satellite, transmissions, many, amateur, radio, repeaters, identify, with, morse, even, though, they, are, used, for, voice, communications, an, important, application, is, signalling, for, help, through, sos, this, can, be, sent, many, ways, keying, a, radio, on, and, off, flashing, a, mirror, toggling, a, flashlight, and, similar, methods, the, sos, signal, is, not, sent, as, three, separate, characters, rather, it, is, a, prosign, sos, and, is, keyed, without, gaps, between, characters, some, nokia, mobile, phones, offer, an, option, to, alert, the, user, of, an, incoming, text, message, with, the, morse, tone, representing, sms, or, short, message, service, in, addition, applications, are, now, available, for, mobile, phones, that, enable, short, messages, to, be, input, in, morse, code, morse, code, has, been, employed, as, an, assistive, technology, helping, people, with, a, variety, of, disabilities, to, communicate, for, example, the, android, operating, system, versions, 5, 0, and, higher, allow, users, to, input, text, using, morse, code, as, an, alternative, to, a, keypad, or, handwriting, recognition, morse, can, be, sent, by, persons, with, severe, motion, disabilities, as, long, as, they, have, some, minimal, motor, control, an, original, solution, to, the, problem, that, caretakers, have, to, learn, to, decode, has, been, an, electronic, typewriter, with, the, codes, written, on, the, keys, codes, were, sung, by, users, see, the, voice, typewriter, employing, morse, or, votem, morse, code, can, also, be, translated, by, computer, and, used, in, a, speaking, communication, aid, in, some, cases, this, means, alternately, blowing, into, and, sucking, on, a, plastic, tube, sip, and, puff, interface, an, important, advantage, of, morse, code, over, row, column, scanning, is, that, once, learned, it, does, not, require, looking, at, a, display, also, it, appears, faster, than, scanning, in, one, case, reported, in, the, radio, amateur, magazine, qst, an, old, shipboard, radio, operator, who, had, a, stroke, and, lost, the, ability, to, speak, or, write, could, communicate, with, his, physician, a, radio, amateur, by, blinking, his, eyes, in, morse, two, examples, of, communication, in, intensive, care, units, were, also, published, in, qst, magazine, another, example, occurred, in, 1966, when, prisoner, of, war, jeremiah, denton, brought, on, television, by, his, north, vietnamese, captors, morse, blinked, the, word, torture, in, these, two, cases, interpreters, were, available, to, understand, those, series, of, eye, blinks, international, morse, code, is, composed, of, five, elements, 3, morse, code, can, be, transmitted, in, a, number, of, ways, originally, as, electrical, pulses, along, a, telegraph, wire, but, later, extended, to, an, audio, tone, a, radio, signal, with, short, and, long, tones, or, high, and, low, tones, or, as, a, mechanical, audible, or, visual, signal, e, g, a, flashing, light, using, devices, like, an, aldis, lamp, or, a, heliograph, a, common, flashlight, or, even, a, car, horn, some, mine, rescues, have, used, pulling, on, a, rope, a, short, pull, for, a, dot, and, a, long, pull, for, a, dah, ground, forces, send, messages, to, aircraft, with, panel, signalling, where, a, horizontal, panel, is, a, dah, and, a, vertical, panel, a, dit, morse, messages, are, generally, transmitted, by, a, hand, operated, device, such, as, a, telegraph, key, so, there, are, variations, introduced, by, the, skill, of, the, sender, and, receiver, more, experienced, operators, can, send, and, receive, at, faster, speeds, in, addition, individual, operators, differ, slightly, for, example, using, slightly, longer, or, shorter, dahs, or, gaps, perhaps, only, for, particular, characters, this, is, called, their, fist, and, experienced, operators, can, recognize, specific, individuals, by, it, alone, a, good, operator, who, sends, clearly, and, is, easy, to, copy, is, said, to, have, a, good, fist, a, poor, fist, is, a, characteristic, of, sloppy, or, hard, to, copy, morse, code, morse, code, is, transmitted, using, just, two, states, on, and, off, morse, code, may, be, represented, as, a, binary, code, and, that, is, what, telegraph, operators, do, when, transmitting, messages, working, from, the, above, itu, definition, and, further, defining, a, bit, as, a, dot, time, a, morse, code, sequence, may, be, crudely, represented, a, combination, of, the, following, five, bit, strings, the, marks, and, gaps, alternate, dits, and, dahs, are, always, separated, by, one, of, the, gaps, and, that, the, gaps, are, always, separated, by, a, dit, or, a, dah, a, more, efficient, binary, encoding, uses, only, two, bits, for, each, dit, or, dah, element, with, the, 1, dit, length, pause, that, must, follow, after, each, automatically, included, for, every, 2, bit, code, one, possible, coding, is, by, number, value, for, the, length, of, signal, tone, sent, one, could, use, 01, b, for, a, dit, and, the, automatic, single, dit, pause, after, it, and, 11, b, for, a, dah, and, the, automatic, single, dit, following, pause, and, 00, b, for, the, extra, pause, between, letters, in, effect, an, end, of, letter, mark, that, leaves, the, code, 10, b, available, for, some, other, purpose, such, as, an, escape, character, or, to, more, compactly, represent, the, extra, space, between, words, an, end, of, word, mark, instead, of, 00, 00, 00, b, only, 6, dit, lengths, since, the, 7th, is, automatically, inserted, as, part, of, the, prior, dit, or, dah, although, the, dit, and, inter, letter, pauses, work, out, to, be, the, same, for, any, letter, containing, a, dah, the, two, bit, encoding, uses, digital, memory, more, compactly, than, the, direct, conversion, bit, strings, mentioned, above, including, the, letter, separating, spaces, all, international, morse, letter, codes, pack, into, 12, bits, or, less, 5, symbols, and, most, fit, into, 10, bits, or, less, 4, symbols, most, of, the, procedural, signs, fit, into, 14, bits, with, a, few, only, needing, 12, bits, 5, symbols, and, all, digits, require, exactly, 12, bits, for, example, morse, g, 2, extra, empty, dits, for, end, of, letter, would, binary, encode, as, 11, b, 11, b, 01, b, 00, b, when, packed, it, is, 1111, 0100, b, f4, x, which, stores, into, only, one, byte, two, nibbles, as, does, every, three, element, code, the, bit, encoding, for, the, longer, method, mentioned, earlier, the, same, letter, would, encode, as, 1110, b, 1110, b, 1000, b, 1110, 1110, 1000, b, ee8, x, or, one, and, a, half, bytes, three, nibbles, the, space, saving, allows, small, devices, like, portable, memory, keyers, to, have, more, and, longer, international, morse, code, sequences, in, small, conventional, device, driver, microprocessors, ram, chips, the, very, long, time, constants, of, 19th, and, early, 20th, century, submarine, communications, cables, required, a, different, form, of, morse, signalling, instead, of, keying, a, voltage, on, and, off, for, varying, times, the, dits, and, dahs, were, represented, by, two, polarities, of, voltage, impressed, on, the, cable, for, a, uniform, time, below, is, an, illustration, of, timing, conventions, the, phrase, morse, code, in, morse, code, format, would, normally, be, written, something, like, this, where, represents, dahs, and, represents, dits, next, is, the, exact, conventional, timing, for, this, phrase, with, representing, signal, on, and, representing, signal, off, each, for, the, time, length, of, exactly, one, dit, morse, code, is, often, spoken, or, written, with, dah, for, dashes, dit, for, dots, located, at, the, end, of, a, character, and, di, for, dots, located, at, the, beginning, or, internally, within, the, character, thus, the, following, morse, code, sequence, is, spoken, or, sung, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah, di, dah, dit, di, di, dit, dit, dah, di, dah, dit, dah, dah, dah, dah, di, dit, dit, for, use, on, radio, there, is, little, point, in, learning, to, read, written, morse, as, above, rather, the, sounds, of, all, of, the, letters, and, symbols, need, to, be, learned, for, both, sending, and, receiving, all, morse, code, elements, depend, on, the, dot, dit, length, a, dah, is, the, length, of, 3, dits, with, no, gaps, between, and, spacings, are, specified, in, number, of, dit, lengths, an, unambiguous, method, of, specifying, the, transmission, speed, is, to, specify, the, dit, duration, as, for, example, 50, milliseconds, specifying, the, dit, duration, is, however, not, the, common, practice, usually, speeds, are, stated, in, words, per, minute, that, introduces, ambiguity, because, words, have, different, numbers, of, characters, and, characters, have, different, dit, lengths, it, is, not, immediately, clear, how, a, specific, word, rate, determines, the, dit, duration, in, milliseconds, some, method, to, standardize, the, transformation, of, a, word, rate, to, a, dit, duration, is, useful, a, simple, way, to, do, this, is, to, choose, a, dit, duration, that, would, send, a, typical, word, the, desired, number, of, times, in, one, minute, if, for, example, the, operator, wanted, a, character, speed, of, 13, words, per, minute, the, operator, would, choose, a, dit, rate, that, would, send, the, typical, word, 13, times, in, exactly, one, minute, the, typical, word, thus, determines, the, dit, length, it, is, common, to, assume, that, a, word, is, 5, characters, long, there, are, two, common, typical, words, paris, and, codex, paris, mimics, a, word, rate, that, is, typical, of, natural, language, words, and, reflects, the, benefits, of, morse, code, s, shorter, code, durations, for, common, characters, such, as, e, and, t, codex, offers, a, word, rate, that, is, typical, of, 5, letter, code, groups, sequences, of, random, letters, using, the, word, paris, as, a, standard, the, number, of, dit, units, is, 50, and, a, simple, calculation, shows, that, the, dit, length, at, 20, words, per, minute, is, 60, milliseconds, using, the, word, codex, with, 60, dit, units, the, dit, length, at, 20, words, per, minute, is, 50, milliseconds, because, morse, code, is, usually, sent, by, hand, it, is, unlikely, that, an, operator, could, be, that, precise, with, the, dit, length, and, the, individual, characteristics, and, preferences, of, the, operators, usually, override, the, standards, for, commercial, radiotelegraph, licenses, in, the, united, states, the, federal, communications, commission, specifies, tests, for, morse, code, proficiency, in, words, per, minute, and, in, code, groups, per, minute, 13, 207, c, 13, 209, d, the, fcc, specifies, that, a, word, is, 5, characters, long, the, commission, specifies, morse, code, test, elements, at, 16, code, groups, per, minute, 20, words, per, minute, 20, code, groups, per, minute, and, 25, words, per, minute, 13, 203, b, the, word, per, minute, rate, would, be, close, to, the, paris, standard, and, the, code, groups, per, minute, would, be, close, to, the, codex, standard, while, the, federal, communications, commission, no, longer, requires, morse, code, for, amateur, radio, licenses, the, old, requirements, were, similar, to, the, requirements, for, commercial, radiotelegraph, licenses, 97, 503, 1996, a, difference, between, amateur, radio, licenses, and, commercial, radiotelegraph, licenses, is, that, commercial, operators, must, be, able, to, receive, code, groups, of, random, characters, along, with, plain, language, text, for, each, class, of, license, the, code, group, speed, requirement, is, slower, than, the, plain, language, text, requirement, for, example, for, the, radiotelegraph, operator, license, the, examinee, must, pass, a, 20, word, per, minute, plain, text, test, and, a, 16, word, per, minute, code, group, test, based, upon, a, 50, dit, duration, standard, word, such, as, paris, the, time, for, one, dit, duration, or, one, unit, can, be, computed, by, the, formula, where, t, is, the, unit, time, or, dit, duration, in, milliseconds, and, w, is, the, speed, in, wpm, high, speed, telegraphy, contests, are, held, according, to, the, guinness, book, of, records, in, june, 2005, at, the, international, amateur, radio, union, s, 6th, world, championship, in, high, speed, telegraphy, in, primorsko, bulgaria, andrei, bindasov, of, belarus, transmitted, 230, morse, code, marks, of, mixed, text, in, one, minute, sometimes, especially, while, teaching, morse, code, the, timing, rules, above, are, changed, so, two, different, speeds, are, used, a, character, speed, and, a, text, speed, the, character, speed, is, how, fast, each, individual, letter, is, sent, the, text, speed, is, how, fast, the, entire, message, is, sent, for, example, individual, characters, may, be, sent, at, a, 13, words, per, minute, rate, but, the, intercharacter, and, interword, gaps, may, be, lengthened, so, the, word, rate, is, only, 5, words, per, minute, using, different, character, and, text, speeds, is, in, fact, a, common, practice, and, is, used, in, the, farnsworth, method, of, learning, morse, code, some, methods, of, teaching, morse, code, use, a, dichotomic, search, table, people, learning, morse, code, using, the, farnsworth, method, are, taught, to, send, and, receive, letters, and, other, symbols, at, their, full, target, speed, that, is, with, normal, relative, timing, of, the, dits, dahs, and, spaces, within, each, symbol, for, that, speed, the, farnsworth, method, is, named, for, donald, r, russ, farnsworth, also, known, by, his, call, sign, w6ttb, however, initially, exaggerated, spaces, between, symbols, and, words, are, used, to, give, thinking, time, to, make, the, sound, shape, of, the, letters, and, symbols, easier, to, learn, the, spacing, can, then, be, reduced, with, practice, and, familiarity, another, popular, teaching, method, is, the, koch, method, invented, in, 1935, by, the, german, engineer, and, former, stormtrooper, ludwig, koch, which, uses, the, full, target, speed, from, the, outset, but, begins, with, just, two, characters, once, strings, containing, those, two, characters, can, be, copied, with, 90, accuracy, an, additional, character, is, added, and, so, on, until, the, full, character, set, is, mastered, in, north, america, many, thousands, of, individuals, have, increased, their, code, recognition, speed, after, initial, memorization, of, the, characters, by, listening, to, the, regularly, scheduled, code, practice, transmissions, broadcast, by, w1aw, the, american, radio, relay, league, s, headquarters, station, as, of, 2015, the, united, states, military, taught, morse, code, as, an, 81, day, self, paced, course, having, phased, out, more, traditional, classes, visual, mnemonic, charts, have, been, devised, over, the, ages, baden, powell, included, one, in, the, girl, guides, handbook, in, 1918, in, the, united, kingdom, many, people, learned, the, morse, code, by, means, of, a, series, of, words, or, phrases, that, have, the, same, rhythm, as, a, morse, character, for, instance, q, in, morse, is, dah, dah, di, dah, which, can, be, memorized, by, the, phrase, god, save, the, queen, and, the, morse, for, f, is, di, di, dah, dit, which, can, be, memorized, as, did, she, like, it, most, numbers, have, an, unofficial, short, form, given, in, the, table, below, they, are, only, used, when, both, the, sender, and, the, receiver, understand, that, numbers, and, not, letters, are, intended, for, example, one, often, sees, the, most, common, r, s, t, signal, report, rendered, as, 5, nn, instead, of, 599, prosigns, for, morse, code, are, special, usually, unwritten, procedural, signals, or, symbols, that, are, used, to, indicate, changes, in, communications, protocol, status, or, white, space, text, formatting, actions, the, symbols, and, are, not, defined, inside, the, official, itu, r, international, morse, code, recommendation, but, informal, conventions, for, them, exist, the, symbol, was, formally, added, in, 2004, the, typical, tactic, for, creating, morse, codes, for, diacritics, and, non, latin, alphabetic, scripts, has, been, to, begin, by, simply, using, the, international, morse, codes, used, for, letters, whose, sound, matches, the, sound, of, the, local, alphabet, because, gerke, code, the, predecessor, to, international, morse, was, in, official, use, in, central, europe, and, included, four, characters, not, included, in, the, international, morse, standard, and, ch, it, has, served, as, a, beginning, point, for, other, languages, that, use, an, alphabetic, script, but, require, codes, for, letters, not, accommodated, by, international, morse, the, usual, method, has, been, to, first, transliterate, the, sounds, represented, by, the, international, code, and, the, four, unique, gerke, codes, into, the, local, alphabet, hence, greek, hebrew, russian, and, ukrainian, morse, codes, if, more, codes, are, needed, one, can, either, invent, a, new, code, or, convert, an, otherwise, unused, code, from, either, code, set, to, the, non, latin, letter, for, example, for, russian, and, bulgarian, russian, morse, code, is, used, to, map, the, cyrillic, characters, to, four, element, codes, many, of, the, characters, are, encoded, the, same, as, their, latin, alphabet, look, alikes, or, sound, alikes, a, o, e, i, t, m, n, r, k, etc, the, bulgarian, alphabet, contains, 30, characters, which, exactly, match, all, possible, combinations, of, 1, 2, 3, and, 4, dits, and, dahs, russian, is, used, as, bulgarian, russian, is, used, as, bulgarian, russian, requires, two, more, codes, for, letters, and, which, are, each, encoded, with, 5, elements, non, alphabetic, scripts, require, more, radical, adaption, japanese, morse, code, wabun, code, has, a, separate, encoding, for, kana, script, although, many, of, the, codes, are, used, for, international, morse, the, sounds, they, represent, are, mostly, unrelated, the, japanese, wabun, code, includes, special, prosigns, for, switching, back, and, forth, from, international, morse, signals, a, switch, from, international, morse, to, wabun, and, to, return, from, wabun, to, international, morse, for, chinese, chinese, telegraph, code, is, used, to, map, chinese, characters, to, four, digit, codes, and, send, these, digits, out, using, standard, morse, code, korean, morse, code, uses, the, skats, mapping, originally, developed, to, allow, korean, to, be, typed, on, western, typewriters, skats, maps, hangul, characters, to, arbitrary, letters, of, the, latin, script, and, has, no, relationship, to, pronunciation, in, korean, during, early, world, war, i, 1914, 1916, germany, briefly, experimented, with, dotty, and, dashy, morse, in, essence, adding, a, dot, or, a, dash, at, the, end, of, each, morse, symbol, each, one, was, quickly, broken, by, allied, sigint, and, standard, morse, was, resumed, by, spring, 1916, only, a, small, percentage, of, western, front, north, atlantic, and, mediterranean, sea, traffic, was, in, dotty, or, dashy, morse, during, the, entire, war, in, popular, culture, this, is, mostly, remembered, in, the, book, the, codebreakers, by, kahn, and, in, the, national, archives, of, the, uk, and, australia, whose, sigint, operators, copied, most, of, this, morse, variant, kahn, s, cited, sources, come, from, the, popular, press, and, wireless, magazines, of, the, time, other, forms, of, fractional, morse, or, fractionated, morse, have, emerged, decoding, software, for, morse, code, ranges, from, software, defined, wide, band, radio, receivers, coupled, to, the, reverse, beacon, network, which, decodes, signals, and, detects, cq, messages, on, ham, bands, to, smartphone, applications
