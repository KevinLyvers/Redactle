ancient, medieval, modern, kurdish, kurd, is, a, northwestern, iranian, language, or, group, of, languages, spoken, by, kurds, in, the, region, of, kurdistan, namely, in, turkey, northern, iraq, northwest, and, northeast, iran, and, syria, kurdish, varieties, constitute, a, dialect, continuum, with, some, mutually, unintelligible, varieties, and, collectively, have, 26, million, native, speakers, the, main, varieties, of, kurdish, are, kurmanji, sorani, and, southern, kurdish, xwar, n, the, majority, of, the, kurds, speak, kurmanji, and, most, kurdish, texts, are, written, in, kurmanji, and, sorani, kurmanji, is, written, in, the, hawar, alphabet, a, derivation, of, the, latin, script, and, sorani, is, written, in, the, sorani, alphabet, a, derivation, of, the, arabic, script, a, separate, group, of, non, kurdish, northwestern, iranian, languages, the, zaza, gorani, languages, are, also, spoken, by, several, million, ethnic, kurds, the, classification, of, laki, as, a, dialect, of, southern, kurdish, or, as, a, fourth, language, under, kurdish, is, a, matter, of, debate, but, the, differences, between, laki, and, other, southern, kurdish, dialects, are, minimal, the, literary, output, in, kurdish, was, mostly, confined, to, poetry, until, the, early, 20th, century, when, more, general, literature, became, developed, today, the, two, principal, written, kurdish, dialects, are, kurmanji, and, sorani, sorani, is, along, with, arabic, one, of, the, two, official, languages, of, iraq, and, is, in, political, documents, simply, referred, to, as, kurdish, the, kurdish, varieties, belong, to, the, iranian, branch, of, the, indo, european, family, they, are, generally, classified, as, northwestern, iranian, languages, or, by, some, scholars, as, intermediate, between, northwestern, and, southwestern, iranian, martin, van, bruinessen, notes, that, kurdish, has, a, strong, south, western, iranian, element, whereas, zaza, and, gurani, do, belong, to, the, north, west, iranian, group, ludwig, paul, concludes, that, kurdish, seems, to, be, a, northwestern, iranian, language, in, origin, but, acknowledges, that, it, shares, many, traits, with, southwestern, iranian, languages, like, persian, apparently, due, to, longstanding, and, intense, historical, contacts, windfuhr, identified, kurdish, dialects, as, parthian, albeit, with, a, median, substratum, windfuhr, and, frye, assume, an, eastern, origin, for, kurdish, and, consider, it, as, related, to, eastern, and, central, iranian, dialects, the, present, state, of, knowledge, about, kurdish, allows, at, least, roughly, drawing, the, approximate, borders, of, the, areas, where, the, main, ethnic, core, of, the, speakers, of, the, contemporary, kurdish, dialects, was, formed, the, most, argued, hypothesis, on, the, localisation, of, the, ethnic, territory, of, the, kurds, remains, d, n, mackenzie, s, theory, proposed, in, the, early, 1960s, mackenzie, 1961, developing, the, ideas, of, p, tedesco, 1921, 255, and, regarding, the, common, phonetic, isoglosses, shared, by, kurdish, persian, and, baluchi, mackenzie, concluded, that, the, speakers, of, these, three, languages, may, once, have, been, in, closer, contact, kurdish, varieties, are, divided, into, three, or, four, groups, with, varying, degrees, of, mutual, intelligibility, in, historical, evolution, terms, kurmanji, is, less, modified, than, sorani, and, pehlewani, in, both, phonetic, and, morphological, structure, the, sorani, group, has, been, influenced, by, among, other, things, its, closer, cultural, proximity, to, the, other, languages, spoken, by, kurds, in, the, region, including, the, gorani, language, in, parts, of, iranian, kurdistan, and, iraqi, kurdistan, philip, g, kreyenbroek, an, expert, writing, in, 1992, says, since, 1932, most, kurds, have, used, the, roman, script, to, write, kurmanji, sorani, is, normally, written, in, an, adapted, form, of, the, arabic, script, reasons, for, describing, kurmanji, and, sorani, as, dialects, of, one, language, are, their, common, origin, and, the, fact, that, this, usage, reflects, the, sense, of, ethnic, identity, and, unity, among, the, kurds, from, a, linguistic, or, at, least, a, grammatical, point, of, view, however, kurmanji, and, sorani, differ, as, much, from, each, other, as, english, and, german, and, it, would, seem, appropriate, to, refer, to, them, as, languages, for, example, sorani, has, neither, gender, nor, case, endings, whereas, kurmanji, has, both, differences, in, vocabulary, and, pronunciation, are, not, as, great, as, between, german, and, english, but, they, are, still, considerable, according, to, encyclopaedia, of, islam, although, kurdish, is, not, a, unified, language, its, many, dialects, are, interrelated, and, at, the, same, time, distinguishable, from, other, western, iranian, languages, the, same, source, classifies, different, kurdish, dialects, as, two, main, groups, northern, and, central, the, average, kurmanji, speaker, does, not, find, it, easy, to, communicate, with, the, inhabitants, of, sulaymaniyah, or, halabja, some, linguistic, scholars, assert, that, the, term, kurdish, has, been, applied, extrinsically, in, describing, the, language, the, kurds, speak, whereas, some, ethnic, kurds, have, used, the, word, term, to, simply, describe, their, ethnicity, and, refer, to, their, language, as, kurmanji, sorani, hewrami, kermanshahi, kalhori, or, whatever, other, dialect, or, language, they, speak, some, historians, have, noted, that, it, is, only, recently, that, the, kurds, who, speak, the, sorani, dialect, have, begun, referring, to, their, language, as, kurd, in, addition, to, their, identity, which, is, translated, to, simply, mean, kurdish, the, mokriani, variety, of, sorani, is, widely, spoken, in, mokrian, piranshahr, and, mahabad, are, two, principal, cities, of, the, mokrian, area, zaza, gorani, languages, which, are, spoken, by, communities, in, the, wider, area, who, identify, as, ethnic, kurds, are, not, linguistically, classified, as, kurdish, zaza, gorani, is, classified, as, adjunct, to, kurdish, although, authorities, differ, in, the, details, groups, kurdish, with, zaza, gorani, within, a, northwestern, i, group, while, glottolog, based, on, encyclop, dia, iranica, prefers, an, areal, grouping, of, central, dialects, or, kermanic, within, northwest, iranic, with, kurdish, but, not, zaza, gorani, grouped, with, kermanic, gorani, is, distinct, from, northern, and, central, kurdish, yet, shares, vocabulary, with, both, of, them, and, there, are, some, grammatical, similarities, with, central, kurdish, the, hawrami, dialects, of, gorani, includes, a, variety, that, was, an, important, literary, language, since, the, 14th, century, but, it, was, replaced, by, central, kurdish, in, the, 20th, century, european, scholars, have, maintained, that, gorani, is, separate, from, kurdish, and, that, kurdish, is, synonymous, with, the, northern, kurdish, group, whereas, ethnic, kurds, maintain, that, kurdish, encompasses, any, of, the, unique, languages, or, dialects, spoken, by, kurds, that, are, not, spoken, by, neighbouring, ethnic, groups, gorani, is, classified, as, part, of, the, zaza, gorani, branch, of, indo, iranian, languages, the, zaza, language, spoken, mainly, in, turkey, differs, both, grammatically, and, in, vocabulary, and, is, generally, not, understandable, by, gorani, speakers, but, it, is, considered, related, to, gorani, almost, all, zaza, speaking, communities, as, well, as, speakers, of, the, closely, related, shabaki, dialect, spoken, in, parts, of, iraqi, kurdistan, identify, themselves, as, ethnic, kurds, geoffrey, haig, and, ergin, pengin, in, their, recent, study, suggest, grouping, the, kurdish, languages, into, northern, kurdish, central, kurdish, southern, kurdish, zaza, and, gorani, and, avoid, the, subgrouping, zaza, gorani, the,
