the, napoleonic, code, french, code, napol, on, officially, the, civil, code, of, the, french, french, code, civil, des, fran, ais, simply, referred, to, as, code, civil, is, the, french, civil, code, established, during, the, french, consulate, in, 1804, and, still, in, force, in, france, although, heavily, and, frequently, amended, since, its, inception, although, napoleon, himself, was, not, directly, involved, in, the, drafting, of, the, code, as, it, was, drafted, by, a, commission, of, four, eminent, jurists, he, chaired, many, of, the, commission, s, plenary, sessions, and, his, support, was, crucial, to, its, passage, into, law, the, code, with, its, stress, on, clearly, written, and, accessible, law, was, a, major, milestone, in, the, abolition, of, the, previous, patchwork, of, feudal, laws, historian, robert, holtman, regards, it, as, one, of, the, few, documents, that, have, influenced, the, whole, world, the, napoleonic, code, is, often, portrayed, to, be, one, of, the, most, widespread, systems, of, law, in, the, world, claimed, to, be, in, force, in, various, forms, in, about, 120, countries, but, many, of, those, countries, are, civil, code, countries, that, had, their, own, version, of, their, civil, code, for, centuries, the, napoleonic, code, was, not, the, first, legal, code, to, be, established, in, a, european, country, with, a, civil, law, legal, system, it, was, preceded, by, the, codex, maximilianeus, bavaricus, civilis, bavaria, 1756, the, allgemeines, landrecht, prussia, 1794, and, the, west, galician, code, galicia, then, part, of, austria, 1797, it, was, however, the, first, modern, legal, code, to, be, adopted, with, a, pan, european, scope, and, it, strongly, influenced, the, law, of, many, of, the, countries, formed, during, and, after, the, napoleonic, wars, the, napoleonic, code, influenced, developing, countries, outside, europe, attempting, to, modernise, and, defeudalise, their, countries, through, legal, reforms, such, as, those, in, the, middle, east, while, in, latin, america, the, spanish, and, portuguese, had, established, their, own, versions, of, the, civil, code, the, categories, of, the, napoleonic, code, were, not, drawn, from, earlier, french, law, but, instead, from, justinian, s, sixth, century, codification, of, roman, law, the, corpus, juris, civilis, and, within, it, the, institutes, the, institutes, divide, into, the, law, of, similarly, the, napoleonic, code, divided, the, law, into, four, sections, before, the, napoleonic, code, france, did, not, have, a, single, set, of, laws, law, consisted, mainly, of, local, customs, sometimes, officially, compiled, in, custumals, coutumes, notably, the, custom, of, paris, there, were, also, exemptions, privileges, and, special, charters, granted, by, kings, or, other, feudal, lords, with, the, revolution, the, last, vestiges, of, feudalism, were, abolished, specifically, as, to, civil, law, the, many, different, bodies, of, law, used, in, different, parts, of, france, were, to, be, replaced, by, a, single, legal, code, the, constituent, assembly, on, 5, october, 1790, voted, for, a, codification, of, french, laws, the, constitution, of, 1791, promised, one, and, the, national, assembly, adopted, a, unanimous, resolution, on, 4, september, 1791, providing, that, there, shall, be, a, code, of, civil, laws, common, for, the, entire, realm, however, it, was, the, national, convention, in, 1793, which, established, a, special, commission, headed, by, jean, jacques, r, gis, de, cambac, r, s, to, oversee, the, drafting, process, his, drafts, of, 1793, for, which, cambac, r, s, had, been, given, a, one, month, deadline, 1794, and, 1796, were, all, rejected, by, a, national, convention, and, the, french, directory, of, the, time, was, more, preoccupied, with, the, turmoil, resulting, from, various, wars, and, strife, with, other, european, powers, the, first, draft, contained, 719, articles, and, was, very, revolutionary, but, was, rejected, for, being, too, technical, and, criticised, for, not, being, radical, or, philosophical, enough, the, second, with, only, 297, articles, was, rejected, for, being, too, brief, and, was, criticised, for, being, a, mere, manual, of, morals, the, third, expanded, to, 1, 104, articles, was, presented, under, the, conservative, directory, regime, but, never, even, came, up, for, discussion, another, commission, established, in, december, 1799, established, a, fourth, outline, drafted, in, part, by, jean, ignace, jacqueminot, 1754, 1813, jacqueminot, s, draft, the, so, called, loi, jacqueminot, dealt, almost, exclusively, with, persons, and, emphasised, the, need, to, reform, the, divorce, laws, to, strengthen, parental, authority, and, increase, the, testator, s, freedom, to, dispose, of, the, free, portion, of, his, estate, it, was, rejected, napoleon, s, victory, at, the, battle, of, marengo, allowed, him, to, consolidate, his, power, in, france, returning, to, paris, he, appointed, on, 12, august, 1800, a, commission, of, distinguished, jurists, and, politicians, including, fr, jacques, de, maleville, fran, ois, denis, tronchet, f, lix, julien, jean, bigot, de, pr, ameneu, jean, tienne, marie, portalis, to, draft, a, civil, code, for, this, commission, cambac, r, s, now, second, consul, and, napoleon, himself, chaired, the, plenary, sessions, after, this, process, finished, the, code, was, sent, to, the, legislative, body, as, a, preliminary, bill, in, december, 1801, where, it, was, rejected, by, a, vote, of, 142, to, 139, in, response, napoleon, announced, on, 2, january, 1802, that, he, was, suspending, all, projects, effectively, closing, the, assemblies, sessions, simultaneously, he, went, to, the, s, nat, conservateur, to, berate, its, members, these, tactics, cowed, the, legislature, into, submission, and, gave, napoleon, the, majority, he, needed, the, code, finally, came, into, effect, on, 21, march, 1804, the, process, developed, mainly, out, of, the, various, customs, but, was, inspired, by, justinian, s, sixth, century, codification, of, roman, law, the, corpus, juris, civilis, and, within, that, justinian, s, code, codex, the, napoleonic, code, however, differed, from, justinian, s, in, important, ways, the, napoleonic, code, marked, a, fundamental, change, in, the, nature, of, the, civil, law, legal, system, making, laws, clearer, and, more, accessible, it, also, superseded, the, former, conflict, between, royal, legislative, power, and, particularly, in, the, final, years, before, the, revolution, protests, by, judges, representing, views, and, privileges, of, the, social, classes, to, which, they, belonged, such, conflict, led, the, revolutionaries, to, take, a, negative, view, of, judges, making, law, this, is, reflected, in, the, napoleonic, code, provision, prohibiting, judges, from, deciding, a, case, by, way, of, introducing, a, general, rule, article, 5, since, the, creation, of, general, rules, is, an, exercise, of, legislative, and, not, of, judicial, power, in, theory, there, is, thus, no, case, law, in, france, however, the, courts, still, had, to, fill, in, the, gaps, in, the, laws, and, regulations, and, indeed, were, prohibited, from, refusing, to, do, so, article, 4, moreover, both, the, code, and, legislation, have, required, judicial, interpretation, thus, a, vast, body, of, case, law, has, come, into, existence, but, without, any, rule, of, stare, decisis, the, preliminary, article, of, the, code, established, certain, important, provisions, regarding, the, rule, of, law, laws, could, be, applied, only, if, they, had, been, duly, promulgated, and, then, only, if, they, had, previously, been, officially, published, including, provisions, for, publishing, delays, given, the, means, of, communication, available, at, the, time, in, brief, no, secret, laws, were, authorised, it, prohibited, ex, post, facto, laws, i, e, laws, that, apply, to, events, that, occurred, before, their, introduction, the, code, also, prohibited, judges, from, refusing, to, do, justice, on, grounds, of, the, insufficiency, of, the, law, thereby, encouraging, them, to, interpret, the, law, on, the, other, hand, it, also, prohibited, judges, from, making, general, judgements, of, a, legislative, nature, see, above, with, regard, to, family, the, code, established, the, supremacy, of, the, husband, over, his, wife, and, children, the, status, quo, in, europe, at, the, time, women, had, even, fewer, rights, than, children, divorce, by, mutual, consent, was, abolished, in, 1804, the, draft, military, code, was, presented, to, napoleon, by, the, special, commission, headed, by, pierre, daru, in, june, 1805, however, as, the, war, of, the, third, coalition, progressed, the, code, was, put, aside, and, never, implemented, in, 1791, louis, michel, le, peletier, de, saint, fargeau, presented, a, new, criminal, code, to, the, national, constituent, assembly, he, explained, that, it, outlawed, only, true, crimes, and, not, phony, offences, created, by, superstition, feudalism, the, tax, system, and, despotism, he, did, not, list, the, crimes, created, by, superstition, the, new, penal, code, did, not, mention, blasphemy, heresy, sacrilege, witchcraft, incest, or, homosexuality, which, led, to, these, former, offences, being, swiftly, decriminalised, in, 1810, a, new, criminal, code, was, issued, under, napoleon, as, with, the, penal, code, of, 1791, it, did, not, contain, provisions, for, religious, crimes, incest, or, homosexuality, the, french, revolution, s, declaration, of, the, rights, of, man, and, of, the, citizen, enunciated, the, presumption, of, innocence, until, found, guilty, concerned, by, the, possibility, of, arbitrary, arrest, and, detention, or, excessive, remand, napoleon, remarked, that, care, should, be, taken, to, preserve, personal, freedoms, especially, before, the, imperial, court, these, courts, would, have, a, great, strength, they, should, be, prohibited, from, abusing, this, situation, against, weak, citizens, without, connections, however, remand, still, was, usual, for, defendants, suspected, of, serious, crimes, such, as, murder, the, possibility, of, lengthy, remand, periods, was, one, criticism, particularly, voiced, in, common, law, countries, of, the, napoleonic, code, and, its, de, facto, presumption, of, guilt, another, reason, was, the, combination, of, magistrate, and, prosecutor, into, a, single, role, however, with, the, work, of, the, juge, d, instruction, accomplished, the, trial, itself, did, not, have, the, same, de, jure, presumption, of, guilt, for, instance, the, juror, s, oath, explicitly, required, jurors, not, betray, the, interests, of, the, defendants, or, ignore, their, defence, the, rules, governing, court, proceedings, gave, significant, power, to, the, prosecution, however, criminal, justice, in, european, countries, in, those, days, tended, to, repression, for, instance, it, was, only, in, 1836, that, prisoners, charged, with, a, felony, were, given, a, formal, right, to, counsel, in, england, in, comparison, article, 294, of, the, napoleonic, code, of, criminal, procedure, allowed, the, defendant, access, to, a, lawyer, before, a, cour, d, assises, and, mandated, the, court, to, appoint, a, lawyer, for, the, defendants, who, did, not, have, one, failing, to, do, so, nullified, the, proceedings, whether, or, not, the, cour, d, assises, which, judges, severe, crimes, should, operate, with, a, jury, was, a, topic, of, considerable, controversy, napoleon, supported, jury, trials, or, petit, jury, and, they, were, finally, adopted, on, the, other, hand, napoleon, opposed, the, indictment, jury, grand, jury, of, common, law, countries, and, preferred, to, assign, this, task, to, the, criminal, division, of, the, court, of, appeals, special, courts, were, created, to, judge, criminals, who, might, intimidate, the, jury, the, french, codes, now, more, than, 60, in, number, are, frequently, amended, as, well, as, judicially, re, interpreted, therefore, for, over, a, century, all, of, the, codes, in, force, have, been, documented, in, the, annually, revised, editions, published, by, dalloz, paris, these, editions, consist, of, thorough, annotations, with, references, to, other, codes, relevant, statutes, judicial, decisions, even, if, unpublished, and, international, instruments, the, small, petit, version, of, the, civil, code, in, this, form, is, nearly, 3, 000, pages, available, in, print, and, online, additional, material, including, scholarly, articles, is, added, in, the, larger, expert, expert, version, and, the, still, larger, mega, m, ga, version, both, of, which, are, available, in, print, and, on, searchable, cd, rom, by, this, stage, it, has, been, suggested, the, civil, code, has, become, less, a, book, than, a, database, the, sheer, number, of, codes, together, with, digitisation, led, the, commission, sup, rieure, de, codification, to, reflect, in, its, annual, report, for, 2011, the, commission, observes, that, the, age, of, drawing, up, new, codes, is, probably, reaching, its, end, the, aim, of, a, nearly, complete, codification, of, the, law, is, no, longer, pursued, for, three, reasons, firstly, the, technical, developments, by, which, texts, are, provided, in, non, physical, form, offer, to, users, modes, of, access, that, are, comparable, in, many, ways, to, those, available, through, a, code, secondly, the, creation, of, new, codes, encounters, a, kind, of, law, of, diminishing, returns, in, that, the, more, progress, that, is, made, in, the, development, of, new, codes, the, trickier, it, becomes, to, determine, in, which, code, particular, provisions, should, be, located, and, finally, it, is, clear, that, certain, kinds, of, provision, are, unsuitable, for, codification, since, codification, makes, sense, only, when, it, involves, provisions, that, possess, sufficient, generality, a, year, later, the, commission, recommended, that, after, its, current, codification, projects, were, completed, there, should, not, be, any, further, codes, an, additional, reason, was, government, delay, in, publishing, reforms, that, the, commission, had, completed, the, government, responded, encouragingly, in, march, 2013, but, the, commission, complains, that, this, has, not, been, followed, through, in, particular, that, the, government, has, abandoned, its, plan, for, a, public, service, code, code, g, n, ral, de, la, fonction, publique, even, though, the, napoleonic, code, was, not, the, first, civil, code, and, did, not, represent, the, whole, of, his, empire, it, was, one, of, the, most, influential, it, was, adopted, in, many, countries, occupied, by, the, french, during, the, napoleonic, wars, in, the, german, regions, on, the, west, bank, of, the, rhine, rhenish, palatinate, and, prussian, rhine, province, the, former, duchy, of, berg, and, the, grand, duchy, of, baden, the, napoleonic, code, was, influential, until, the, introduction, of, the, b, rgerliches, gesetzbuch, in, 1900, as, the, first, common, civil, code, for, the, entire, german, empire, a, number, of, factors, have, been, shown, by, arvind, and, stirton, to, have, had, a, determinative, role, in, the, decision, by, the, german, states, to, receive, the, code, including, territorial, concerns, napoleonic, control, and, influence, the, strength, of, central, state, institutions, a, feudal, economy, and, society, rule, by, liberal, enlightened, despotic, rulers, nativism, among, the, governing, elites, and, popular, anti, french, sentiment, a, civil, code, with, napoleonic, code, influences, was, also, adopted, in, 1864, in, romania, and, remained, in, force, until, 2011, the, term, napoleonic, code, is, also, used, to, refer, to, legal, codes, of, other, jurisdictions, that, are, influenced, by, the, french, code, napol, on, especially, the, civil, code, of, lower, canada, replaced, in, 1994, by, the, civil, code, of, quebec, mainly, derived, from, the, coutume, de, paris, which, the, british, continued, to, use, in, canada, following, the, 1763, treaty, of, paris, however, most, of, the, laws, in, latin, american, countries, are, not, heavily, influenced, on, the, napoleonic, code, as, the, spanish, and, portuguese, versions, of, the, civil, code, formed, the, foundation, of, the, latin, american, legal, systems, e, g, the, chilean, mexican, and, puerto, rican, civil, codes, in, mauritius, the, civil, code, which, originates, from, the, napoleonic, code, represents, an, important, primary, source, of, law, and, provides, for, the, rights, of, individuals, matrimonial, regimes, contract, law, and, property, law, amongst, others, the, french, civil, code, was, extended, to, mauritius, under, the, title, code, napol, on, by, decree, of, charles, mathieu, isidore, decaen, capitaine, general, on, 21, april, 1808, the, code, was, modified, and, embodied, in, chapter, 179, of, the, revised, laws, of, mauritius, 1945, edited, by, sir, charlton, lane, former, chief, justice, of, mauritius, the, 1808, decree, was, repealed, by, act, 9, of, 1983, but, the, revision, of, laws, act, which, was, enacted, in, 1974, made, provision, in, section, 7, for, the, publication, of, the, code, under, the, title, code, civil, mauricien, in, the, united, states, the, legal, system, is, largely, based, on, english, common, law, but, the, state, of, louisiana, is, unique, in, having, a, strong, influence, from, french, and, spanish, legal, traditions, on, its, civil, code, spanish, and, french, colonial, forces, quarreled, over, louisiana, during, most, of, the, 1700s, with, spain, ultimately, ceding, the, territory, to, france, in, 1800, which, in, turn, sold, the, territory, to, the, united, states, in, 1803, the, 10th, amendment, to, the, u, s, constitution, grants, states, control, of, laws, not, specifically, given, to, the, federal, government, so, louisiana, s, legal, system, retains, many, french, elements, examples, of, the, practical, legal, differences, between, louisiana, and, the, other, states, include, the, bar, exam, and, legal, standards, of, practice, for, attorneys, in, louisiana, being, significantly, different, from, other, states, louisiana, is, the, only, u, s, state, to, practice, forced, inheritance, of, an, estate, additionally, some, of, louisiana, s, laws, clash, with, the, uniform, commercial, code, practiced, by, the, other, 49, states
