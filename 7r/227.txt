https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnocentrism
ethnocentrism, in, social, science, and, anthropology, as, well, as, in, colloquial, english, discourse, means, to, apply, one, s, own, culture, or, ethnicity, as, a, frame, of, reference, to, judge, other, cultures, practices, behaviors, beliefs, and, people, instead, of, using, the, standards, of, the, particular, culture, involved, since, this, judgment, is, often, negative, some, people, also, use, the, term, to, refer, to, the, belief, that, one, s, culture, is, superior, to, or, more, correct, or, normal, than, all, others, especially, regarding, the, distinctions, that, define, each, ethnicity, s, cultural, identity, such, as, language, behavior, customs, and, religion, in, common, usage, it, can, also, simply, mean, any, culturally, biased, judgment, for, example, ethnocentrism, can, be, seen, in, the, common, portrayals, of, the, global, south, and, the, global, north, ethnocentrism, is, sometimes, related, to, racism, stereotyping, discrimination, or, xenophobia, however, the, term, ethnocentrism, does, not, necessarily, involve, a, negative, view, of, the, others, race, or, indicate, a, negative, connotation, the, opposite, of, ethnocentrism, is, cultural, relativism, a, guiding, philosophy, stating, that, the, best, way, to, understand, a, different, culture, is, through, their, perspective, rather, than, judging, them, from, the, subjective, viewpoints, shaped, by, one, s, own, cultural, standards, the, term, ethnocentrism, was, first, applied, in, the, social, sciences, by, american, sociologist, william, g, sumner, in, his, 1906, book, folkways, sumner, describes, ethnocentrism, as, the, technical, name, for, the, view, of, things, in, which, one, s, own, group, is, the, center, of, everything, and, all, others, are, scaled, and, rated, with, reference, to, it, he, further, characterized, ethnocentrism, as, often, leading, to, pride, vanity, the, belief, in, one, s, own, group, s, superiority, and, contempt, for, outsiders, over, time, ethnocentrism, developed, alongside, the, progression, of, social, understandings, by, people, such, as, social, theorist, theodore, w, adorno, in, adorno, s, the, authoritarian, personality, he, and, his, colleagues, of, the, frankfurt, school, established, a, broader, definition, of, the, term, as, a, result, of, in, group, out, group, differentiation, stating, that, ethnocentrism, combines, a, positive, attitude, toward, one, s, own, ethnic, cultural, group, the, in, group, with, a, negative, attitude, toward, the, other, ethnic, cultural, group, the, out, group, both, of, these, juxtaposing, attitudes, are, also, a, result, of, a, process, known, as, social, identification, and, social, counter, identification, the, term, ethnocentrism, derives, from, two, greek, words, ethnos, meaning, nation, and, kentron, meaning, center, scholars, believe, this, term, was, coined, by, polish, sociologist, ludwig, gumplowicz, in, the, 19th, century, although, alternate, theories, suggest, that, he, only, popularized, the, concept, as, opposed, to, inventing, it, he, saw, ethnocentrism, as, a, phenomenon, similar, to, the, delusions, of, geocentrism, and, anthropocentrism, defining, ethnocentrism, as, the, reasons, by, virtue, of, which, each, group, of, people, believed, it, had, always, occupied, the, highest, point, not, only, among, contemporaneous, peoples, and, nations, but, also, in, relation, to, all, peoples, of, the, historical, past, subsequently, in, the, 20th, century, american, social, scientist, william, g, sumner, proposed, two, different, definitions, in, his, 1906, book, folkways, sumner, stated, that, ethnocentrism, is, the, technical, name, for, this, view, of, things, in, which, one, s, own, group, is, the, center, of, everything, and, all, others, are, scaled, and, rated, with, reference, to, it, in, the, war, and, other, essays, 1911, he, wrote, that, the, sentiment, of, cohesion, internal, comradeship, and, devotion, to, the, in, group, which, carries, with, it, a, sense, of, superiority, to, any, out, group, and, readiness, to, defend, the, interests, of, the, in, group, against, the, out, group, is, technically, known, as, ethnocentrism, according, to, boris, bizumic, it, is, a, popular, misunderstanding, that, sumner, originated, the, term, ethnocentrism, stating, that, in, actuality, he, brought, ethnocentrism, into, the, mainstreams, of, anthropology, social, science, and, psychology, through, his, english, publications, several, theories, have, been, reinforced, through, the, social, and, psychological, understandings, of, ethnocentrism, including, t, w, adorno, s, authoritarian, personality, theory, 1950, donald, t, campbell, s, realistic, group, conflict, theory, 1972, and, henri, tajfel, s, social, identity, theory, 1986, these, theories, have, helped, to, distinguish, ethnocentrism, as, a, means, to, better, understand, the, behaviors, caused, by, in, group, and, out, group, differentiation, throughout, history, and, society, in, social, sciences, ethnocentrism, means, to, judge, another, culture, based, on, the, standard, of, one, s, own, culture, instead, of, the, standard, of, the, other, particular, culture, when, people, use, their, own, culture, as, a, parameter, to, measure, other, cultures, they, often, tend, to, think, that, their, culture, is, superior, and, see, other, cultures, as, inferior, and, bizarre, ethnocentrism, can, be, explained, at, different, levels, of, analysis, for, example, at, an, intergroup, level, this, term, is, seen, as, a, consequence, of, a, conflict, between, groups, while, at, the, individual, level, in, group, cohesion, and, out, group, hostility, can, explain, personality, traits, also, ethnocentrism, can, helps, us, to, explain, the, construction, of, identity, ethnocentrism, can, explain, the, basis, of, one, s, identity, by, excluding, the, outgroup, that, is, the, target, of, ethnocentric, sentiments, and, used, as, a, way, of, distinguishing, oneself, from, other, groups, that, can, be, more, or, less, tolerant, this, practice, in, social, interactions, creates, social, boundaries, such, boundaries, define, and, draw, symbolic, boundaries, of, the, group, that, one, wants, to, be, associated, with, or, belong, to, in, this, way, ethnocentrism, is, a, term, not, only, limited, to, anthropology, but, also, can, be, applied, to, other, fields, of, social, sciences, like, sociology, or, psychology, ethnocentrism, may, be, particularly, enhanced, in, the, presence, of, interethnic, competition, hostility, and, violence, on, the, other, hand, ethnocentrism, may, negatively, influence, expatriate, worker, s, performance, a, more, recent, interpretation, of, ethnocentrism, which, expands, upon, the, work, of, claude, l, vi, strauss, highlights, its, positive, dimension, political, sociologist, audrey, alejandro, of, the, london, school, of, economics, argues, that, while, ethnocentrism, does, produce, social, hierarchies, it, also, produces, diversity, by, maintaining, the, different, dispositions, practices, and, knowledge, of, identity, groups, diversity, is, both, fostered, and, undermined, by, ethnocentrism, ethnocentrism, for, alejandro, is, therefore, neither, something, to, be, suppressed, nor, celebrated, uncritically, rather, observers, can, cultivate, a, balanced, ethnocentrism, individual, self, worth, allowing, themselves, to, be, challenged, and, transformed, by, difference, whilst, still, protecting, difference, the, classifications, of, ethnocentrism, originate, from, the, studies, of, anthropology, with, its, omnipresence, throughout, history, ethnocentrism, has, always, been, a, factor, in, how, different, cultures, and, groups, related, to, one, another, examples, including, how, historically, foreigners, would, be, characterized, as, barbarians, these, trends, exist, in, complex, societies, e, g, the, jews, consider, themselves, to, be, the, chosen, people, and, the, greeks, defend, all, foreigners, as, barbarians, and, how, china, believed, their, country, to, be, the, centre, of, the, world, however, the, anthropocentric, interpretations, initially, took, place, most, notably, in, the, 19th, century, when, anthropologists, began, to, describe, and, rank, various, cultures, according, to, the, degree, to, which, they, had, developed, significant, milestones, such, as, monotheistic, religions, technological, advancements, and, other, historical, progressions, most, rankings, were, strongly, influenced, by, colonization, and, the, belief, to, improve, societies, they, colonized, ranking, the, cultures, based, on, the, progression, of, their, western, societies, and, what, they, classified, as, milestones, comparisons, were, mostly, based, on, what, the, colonists, believed, as, superior, and, what, their, western, societies, have, accomplished, victorian, era, politician, and, historian, thomas, macaulay, once, claimed, that, one, shelf, of, a, western, library, had, more, knowledge, than, the, centuries, of, text, and, literature, written, by, asian, cultures, ideas, developed, by, western, scientists, such, as, herbert, spencer, including, the, concept, of, the, survival, of, the, fittest, contained, ethnocentric, ideals, influencing, the, belief, that, societies, which, were, superior, were, most, likely, to, survive, and, prosper, edward, said, s, concept, of, orientalism, represented, how, western, reactions, to, non, western, societies, were, based, on, an, unequal, power, relationship, that, the, western, world, developed, due, to, its, history, of, colonialism, and, the, influence, it, held, over, non, western, societies, the, ethnocentric, classification, of, primitive, were, also, used, by, 19th, and, 20th, century, anthropologists, and, represented, how, unawareness, in, cultural, and, religious, understanding, changed, overall, reactions, to, non, western, societies, 19th, century, anthropologist, edward, burnett, tylor, wrote, about, primitive, societies, in, primitive, culture, 1871, creating, a, civilization, scale, where, it, was, implied, that, ethnic, cultures, preceded, civilized, societies, the, use, of, savage, as, a, classification, is, modernly, known, as, tribal, or, pre, literate, where, it, was, usually, referred, as, a, derogatory, term, as, the, civilization, scale, became, more, common, examples, that, demonstrate, a, lack, of, understanding, include, when, european, travelers, judged, different, languages, based, on, the, fact, that, they, could, not, understand, it, and, displayed, a, negative, reaction, or, the, intolerance, displayed, by, westerners, when, exposed, to, unknown, religions, and, symbolisms, georg, wilhelm, friedrich, hegel, a, german, philosopher, justified, western, imperialism, by, reasoning, that, since, the, non, western, societies, were, primitive, and, uncivilized, their, culture, and, history, was, not, worth, conserving, and, thus, should, welcome, westernization, anthropologist, franz, boas, saw, the, flaws, in, this, formulaic, approach, to, ranking, and, interpreting, cultural, development, and, committed, himself, to, overthrowing, this, inaccurate, reasoning, due, to, many, factors, involving, their, individual, characteristics, with, his, methodological, innovations, boas, sought, to, show, the, error, of, the, proposition, that, race, determined, cultural, capacity, in, his, 1911, book, the, mind, of, primitive, man, boas, wrote, that, it, is, somewhat, difficult, for, us, to, recognize, that, the, value, which, we, attribute, to, our, own, civilization, is, due, to, the, fact, that, we, participate, in, this, civilization, and, that, it, has, been, controlling, all, our, actions, from, the, time, of, our, birth, but, it, is, certainly, conceivable, that, there, may, be, other, civilizations, based, perhaps, on, different, traditions, and, on, a, different, equilibrium, of, emotion, and, reason, which, are, of, no, less, value, than, ours, although, it, may, be, impossible, for, us, to, appreciate, their, values, without, having, grown, up, under, their, influence, together, boas, and, his, colleagues, propagated, the, certainty, that, there, are, no, inferior, races, or, cultures, this, egalitarian, approach, introduced, the, concept, of, cultural, relativism, to, anthropology, a, methodological, principle, for, investigating, and, comparing, societies, in, as, unprejudiced, a, way, as, possible, and, without, using, a, developmental, scale, as, anthropologists, at, the, time, were, implementing, boas, and, anthropologist, bronis, aw, malinowski, argued, that, any, human, science, had, to, transcend, the, ethnocentric, views, that, could, blind, any, scientist, s, ultimate, conclusions, both, had, also, urged, anthropologists, to, conduct, ethnographic, fieldwork, to, overcome, their, ethnocentrism, to, help, malinowski, would, develop, the, theory, of, functionalism, as, guides, for, producing, non, ethnocentric, studies, of, different, cultures, classic, examples, of, anti, ethnocentric, anthropology, include, margaret, mead, s, coming, of, age, in, samoa, 1928, which, in, time, has, met, with, severe, criticism, for, its, incorrect, data, and, generalisations, malinowski, s, the, sexual, life, of, savages, in, north, western, melanesia, 1929, and, ruth, benedict, s, patterns, of, culture, 1934, mead, and, benedict, were, two, of, boas, s, students, scholars, generally, agree, that, boas, developed, his, ideas, under, the, influence, of, the, german, philosopher, immanuel, kant, legend, has, it, that, on, a, field, trip, to, the, baffin, islands, in, 1883, boas, would, pass, the, frigid, nights, reading, kant, s, critique, of, pure, reason, in, that, work, kant, argued, that, human, understanding, could, not, be, described, according, to, the, laws, that, applied, to, the, operations, of, nature, and, that, its, operations, were, therefore, free, not, determined, and, that, ideas, regulated, human, action, sometimes, independent, of, material, interests, following, kant, boas, pointed, out, the, starving, eskimos, who, because, of, their, religious, beliefs, would, not, hunt, seals, to, feed, themselves, thus, showing, that, no, pragmatic, or, material, calculus, determined, their, values, ethnocentrism, is, believed, to, be, a, learned, behavior, embedded, into, a, variety, of, beliefs, and, values, of, an, individual, or, group, due, to, enculturation, individuals, in, in, groups, have, a, deeper, sense, of, loyalty, and, are, more, likely, to, follow, the, norms, and, develop, relationships, with, associated, members, within, relation, to, enculturation, ethnocentrism, is, said, to, be, a, transgenerational, problem, since, stereotypes, and, similar, perspectives, can, be, enforced, and, encouraged, as, time, progresses, although, loyalty, can, increase, better, in, grouper, approval, limited, interactions, with, other, cultures, can, prevent, individuals, to, have, an, understanding, and, appreciation, towards, cultural, differences, resulting, in, greater, ethnocentrism, the, social, identity, approach, suggests, that, ethnocentric, beliefs, are, caused, by, a, strong, identification, with, one, s, own, culture, that, directly, creates, a, positive, view, of, that, culture, it, is, theorized, by, henri, tajfel, and, john, c, turner, that, to, maintain, that, positive, view, people, make, social, comparisons, that, cast, competing, cultural, groups, in, an, unfavorable, light, alternative, or, opposite, perspectives, could, cause, individuals, to, develop, na, ve, realism, and, be, subject, to, limitations, in, understandings, these, characteristics, can, also, lead, to, individuals, to, become, subject, to, ethnocentrism, when, referencing, out, groups, and, black, sheep, effect, where, personal, perspectives, contradict, those, from, fellow, in, groupers, realistic, conflict, theory, assumes, that, ethnocentrism, happens, due, to, real, or, perceived, conflict, between, groups, this, also, happens, when, a, dominant, group, may, perceive, the, new, members, as, a, threat, scholars, have, recently, demonstrated, that, individuals, are, more, likely, to, develop, in, group, identification, and, out, group, negatively, in, response, to, intergroup, competition, conflict, or, threat, although, the, causes, of, ethnocentric, beliefs, and, actions, can, have, varying, roots, of, context, and, reason, the, effects, of, ethnocentrism, has, had, both, negative, and, positive, effects, throughout, history, the, most, detrimental, effects, of, ethnocentrism, resulting, into, genocide, apartheid, slavery, and, many, violent, conflicts, historical, examples, of, these, negative, effects, of, ethnocentrism, are, the, holocaust, the, crusades, the, trail, of, tears, and, the, internment, of, japanese, americans, these, events, were, a, result, of, cultural, differences, reinforced, inhumanely, by, a, majority, group, who, thought, of, themselves, as, superior, in, his, 1976, book, on, evolution, the, selfish, gene, evolutionary, biologist, richard, dawkins, writes, that, blood, feuds, and, inter, clan, warfare, are, easily, interpretative, in, terms, of, hamilton, s, genetic, theory, simulation, based, experiments, in, evolutionary, game, theory, have, attempted, to, provide, an, explanation, for, the, selection, of, ethnocentric, strategy, phenotypes, the, positive, examples, of, ethnocentrism, throughout, history, have, aimed, to, prohibit, the, callousness, of, ethnocentrism, and, reverse, the, perspectives, of, living, in, a, single, culture, these, organizations, can, include, the, formation, of, the, united, nations, aimed, to, maintain, international, relations, and, the, olympic, games, a, celebration, of, sports, and, friendly, competition, between, cultures, a, study, in, new, zealand, was, used, to, compare, how, individuals, associate, with, in, groups, and, out, groupers, and, has, a, connotation, to, discrimination, strong, in, group, favoritism, benefits, the, dominant, groups, and, is, different, from, out, group, hostility, and, or, punishment, a, suggested, solution, is, to, limit, the, perceived, threat, from, the, out, group, that, also, decreases, the, likeliness, for, those, supporting, the, in, groups, to, negatively, react, ethnocentrism, also, influences, consumer, preference, over, which, goods, they, purchase, a, study, that, used, several, in, group, and, out, group, orientations, have, shown, a, correlation, between, national, identity, consumer, cosmopolitanism, consumer, ethnocentrism, and, the, methods, consumers, choose, their, products, whether, imported, or, domestic, consumer, ethnocentrism, in, which, beliefs, held, by, consumers, in, which, they, determine, which, they, determine, what, foreign, goods, to, consume, a, study, based, on, the, study, of, consumers, was, used, to, determine, that, chinese, we, skeptical, about, purchasing, product, from, japan, due, to, the, deaths, created, by, world, war, ii, ethnocentrism, not, only, causes, effects, upon, a, product, ethnocentrism, is, usually, associated, with, racism, however, as, mentioned, before, ethnocentrism, does, not, necessarily, implicate, a, negative, connotation, in, european, research, the, term, racism, is, not, linked, to, ethnocentrism, because, europeans, avoid, applying, the, concept, of, race, to, humans, meanwhile, using, this, term, is, not, a, problem, for, american, researchers, since, ethnocentrism, implicated, a, strong, identification, with, one, s, in, group, it, mostly, automatically, leads, to, negative, feelings, and, stereotyping, to, the, members, of, the, outgroup, which, can, be, confused, with, racism, finally, scholars, agree, that, avoiding, stereotypes, is, an, indispensable, prerequisite, to, overcome, ethnocentrism, and, mass, media, play, a, key, role, regarding, this, issue, the, differences, that, each, culture, possess, causes, could, hinder, one, another, leading, to, ethnocentrism, and, racism, a, canadian, study, established, the, differences, among, french, canadian, and, english, canadian, respondents, based, on, products, that, would, be, purchased, due, to, ethnocentrism, and, racism, due, to, how, diverse, the, world, has, become, society, has, begun, to, misinterpret, the, term, cultural, diversity, by, using, ethnocentrism, to, create, controversy, among, all, cultures, mass, media, plays, an, important, role, in, our, current, society, we, are, constantly, exposed, to, media, content, every, day, researchers, had, found, that, ethnocentrism, is, dysfunctional, in, communication, and, similar, fields, because, the, lack, of, acceptance, of, other, cultures, leads, to, the, creation, of, barriers, for, people, of, different, backgrounds, to, interact, with, each, other, the, presence, of, ethnocentrism, in, media, content, creates, an, issue, in, the, exchange, of, messages, in, the, communication, process, the, media, industry, is, dominated, by, the, global, north, so, western, ethnocentrism, tends, to, be, exposed, in, the, media, this, can, be, seen, in, the, predominance, of, western, content, in, tv, shows, film, and, other, forms, of, mass, media, some, shows, tend, to, depict, foreign, cultures, as, inferior, or, strange, in, contrast, to, their, own, culture, cinema, has, been, around, in, our, society, since, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, and, it, is, an, important, tool, made, to, entertain, and, or, educate, the, viewer, western, companies, are, usually, the, leaders, of, the, film, industry, thus, it, is, common, to, be, exposed, to, content, based, on, westerners, point, of, view, examples, of, ethnocentrism, are, constantly, seen, in, films, whether, intentionally, or, unintentionally, an, example, of, this, can, be, seen, on, the, american, animated, film, aladdin, by, disney, in, 1992, the, opening, song, of, the, movie, is, arabian, nights, it, is, mentioned, in, the, lyrics, that, it, s, barbaric, hey, but, it, s, home, which, had, caused, debates, among, the, audience, because, it, could, lead, to, thinking, that, the, arabic, culture, is, barbaric, examples, like, this, are, numerous, featuring, in, many, hollywood, films, experts, in, the, field, propose, that, a, way, of, overcoming, ethnocentrism, is, to, avoid, the, use, of, stereotypes, in, films, therefore, the, presence, of, ethnocentrism, in, cinema, leads, to, stereotypical, images, of, cultures, that, differ, from, the, creators, another, film, example, is, a, 2018, film, named, crazy, rich, asians, based, on, the, book, by, kevin, kwan, a, considerable, number, of, people, are, exposed, to, social, media, whose, purpose, is, to, encourage, interaction, among, users, social, media, has, become, a, reliant, source, to, be, able, to, interact, among, others, across, the, world, the, most, common, and, popular, social, media, platforms, are, facebook, instagram, twitter, snapchat, youtube, and, tiktok, social, media, tends, to, play, a, positively, constructive, role, within, a, society, in, which, it, educates, guides, entertain, the, public, and, the, bring, more, awareness, towards, other, cultures, by, illustrating, how, each, one, is, different, from, one, another, even, though, social, media, can, produce, positive, outcomes, within, ethnocentrism, there, are, also, negatives, in, which, it, allows, for, other, cultures, to, judge, one, another, and, create, controversy, someone, who, is, ethnocentric, may, hinder, the, exchange, of, information, by, diminishing, the, interest, of, interacting, with, people, from, other, cultures, notes, further, reading
