analytical, psychology, german, analytische, psychologie, sometimes, translated, as, analytic, psychology, and, referred, to, as, jungian, analysis, is, a, term, coined, by, carl, jung, a, swiss, psychiatrist, to, describe, research, into, his, new, empirical, science, of, the, psyche, it, was, designed, to, distinguish, it, from, freud, s, psychoanalytic, theories, as, their, seven, year, collaboration, on, psychoanalysis, was, drawing, to, an, end, between, 1912, and, 1913, the, evolution, of, his, science, is, contained, in, his, monumental, opus, the, collected, works, written, over, sixty, years, of, his, lifetime, the, history, of, analytical, psychology, is, intimately, linked, with, the, biography, of, jung, at, the, start, it, was, known, as, the, zurich, school, whose, chief, figures, were, eugen, bleuler, franz, riklin, alphonse, maeder, and, jung, all, centred, in, the, burgh, lzli, hospital, in, zurich, it, was, initially, a, theory, concerning, psychological, complexes, until, jung, upon, breaking, with, sigmund, freud, turned, it, into, a, generalised, method, of, investigating, archetypes, and, the, unconscious, as, well, as, into, a, specialised, psychotherapy, analytical, psychology, or, complex, psychology, from, the, german, komplexe, psychologie, is, the, foundation, of, many, developments, in, the, study, and, practice, of, psychology, as, of, other, disciplines, jung, has, many, followers, and, some, of, them, are, members, of, national, societies, around, the, world, they, collaborate, professionally, on, an, international, level, through, the, international, association, of, analytical, psychologists, iaap, and, the, international, association, for, jungian, studies, iajs, jung, s, propositions, have, given, rise, to, a, multidisciplinary, literature, in, numerous, languages, among, widely, used, concepts, specific, to, analytical, psychology, are, anima, and, animus, archetypes, the, collective, unconscious, complexes, extraversion, and, introversion, individuation, the, self, the, shadow, and, synchronicity, the, myers, briggs, type, indicator, mbti, is, loosely, based, on, another, of, jung, s, theories, on, psychological, types, a, lesser, known, idea, was, jung, s, notion, of, the, psychoid, to, denote, a, hypothesised, immanent, plane, beyond, consciousness, distinct, from, the, collective, unconscious, and, a, potential, locus, of, synchronicity, the, approximately, three, schools, of, post, jungian, analytical, psychology, that, are, current, the, classical, archetypal, and, developmental, can, be, said, to, correspond, to, the, developing, yet, overlapping, aspects, of, jung, s, lifelong, explorations, even, if, he, expressly, did, not, want, to, start, a, school, of, jungians, 50, 53, hence, as, jung, proceeded, from, a, clinical, practice, which, was, mainly, traditionally, science, based, and, steeped, in, rationalist, philosophy, anthropology, and, ethnography, his, enquiring, mind, simultaneously, took, him, into, more, esoteric, spheres, such, as, alchemy, astrology, gnosticism, metaphysics, myth, and, the, paranormal, without, ever, abandoning, his, allegiance, to, science, as, his, long, lasting, collaboration, with, wolfgang, pauli, attests, his, wide, ranging, progression, suggests, to, some, commentators, that, over, time, his, analytical, psychotherapy, informed, by, his, intuition, and, teleological, investigations, became, more, of, an, art, the, findings, of, jungian, analysis, and, the, application, of, analytical, psychology, to, contemporary, preoccupations, such, as, social, and, family, relationships, dreams, and, nightmares, work, life, balance, architecture, and, urban, planning, politics, and, economics, conflict, and, warfare, and, climate, change, are, illustrated, in, several, publications, and, films, jung, began, his, career, as, a, psychiatrist, in, z, rich, switzerland, already, employed, at, the, burgh, lzli, hospital, in, 1901, in, his, academic, dissertation, for, the, medical, faculty, of, the, university, of, zurich, he, took, the, risk, of, using, his, experiments, on, somnambulism, and, the, visions, of, his, mediumistic, cousin, helly, preiswerk, the, work, was, entitled, on, the, psychology, and, pathology, of, so, called, occult, phenomena, it, was, accepted, but, caused, great, upset, among, his, mother, s, family, under, the, direction, of, psychiatrist, eugen, bleuler, he, also, conducted, research, with, his, colleagues, using, a, galvanometer, to, evaluate, the, emotional, sensitivities, of, patients, to, lists, of, words, during, word, association, jung, has, left, a, description, of, his, use, of, the, device, in, treatment, his, research, earned, him, a, worldwide, reputation, and, numerous, honours, including, honorary, doctorates, from, clark, and, fordham, universities, in, 1909, and, 1910, respectively, other, honours, followed, later, in, 1907, jung, travelled, to, meet, sigmund, freud, in, vienna, austria, they, had, begun, corresponding, a, year, earlier, at, that, stage, jung, aged, thirty, two, had, a, much, greater, international, renown, than, the, forty, nine, year, old, neurologist, for, a, further, six, years, the, two, scholars, worked, and, travelled, to, the, united, states, together, in, 1911, they, founded, the, international, psychoanalytical, association, of, which, jung, was, the, first, president, however, early, in, the, collaboration, jung, had, already, observed, that, freud, would, not, tolerate, ideas, that, were, different, from, his, own, unlike, most, modern, psychologists, jung, did, not, believe, in, restricting, himself, to, the, scientific, method, as, a, means, to, understanding, the, human, psyche, he, saw, dreams, myths, coincidence, and, folklore, as, empirical, evidence, to, further, understanding, and, meaning, so, although, the, unconscious, cannot, be, studied, by, using, direct, methods, it, acts, as, a, useful, working, hypothesis, according, to, jung, as, he, said, the, beauty, about, the, unconscious, is, that, it, is, really, unconscious, hence, the, unconscious, is, untouchable, by, experimental, researches, or, indeed, any, possible, kind, of, scientific, or, philosophical, reach, precisely, because, it, is, unconscious, it, was, the, publication, of, a, book, by, jung, which, provoked, the, break, with, psychoanalysis, and, led, to, the, founding, of, analytical, psychology, in, 1912, jung, met, miss, miller, brought, to, his, notice, by, the, work, of, th, odore, flournoy, and, whose, case, gave, further, substance, to, his, theory, of, the, collective, unconscious, 213, 215, the, study, of, her, visions, supplied, the, material, which, would, go, on, to, furnish, his, reasoning, which, he, developed, in, psychology, of, the, unconscious, wandlungen, und, symbole, der, libido, re, published, as, symbols, of, transformation, in, 1952, c, w, vol, 5, at, this, freud, muttered, about, heresy, it, was, the, second, part, of, the, work, that, brought, the, divergence, to, light, freud, mentioned, to, ernest, jones, that, it, was, on, page, 174, of, the, original, german, edition, that, jung, according, to, him, had, lost, his, way, 215, it, is, the, extract, where, jung, enlarged, on, his, conception, of, the, libido, the, sanction, was, immediate, jung, was, officially, banned, from, the, vienna, psychoanalytic, circle, from, august, 1912, from, that, date, the, psychoanalytic, movement, split, into, two, obediences, with, freud, s, partisans, on, one, side, karl, abraham, being, delegated, to, write, a, critical, notice, about, jung, and, with, ernest, jones, as, defender, of, freudian, orthodoxy, while, on, the, other, side, were, jung, s, partisans, including, leonhard, seif, franz, riklin, johan, van, ophuijsen, and, alphonse, maeder, 260, jung, s, innovative, ideas, with, a, new, formulation, of, psychology, and, lack, of, contrition, sealed, the, end, of, the, jung, freud, friendship, in, 1913, from, then, the, two, scholars, worked, independently, on, personality, development, jung, had, already, termed, his, approach, analytical, psychology, 1912, while, the, approach, freud, had, founded, is, referred, to, as, the, psychoanalytic, school, psychoanalytische, schule, jung, s, postulated, unconscious, was, quite, different, from, the, model, proposed, by, freud, despite, the, great, influence, that, the, founder, of, psychoanalysis, had, had, on, him, in, particular, tensions, manifested, between, him, and, freud, because, of, various, disagreements, including, those, concerning, the, nature, of, the, libido, jung, de, emphasized, the, importance, of, sexual, development, as, an, instinctual, drive, and, focused, on, the, collective, unconscious, the, part, of, the, unconscious, that, contains, memories, and, ideas, which, jung, believed, were, inherited, from, generations, of, ancestors, while, he, accepted, that, libido, was, an, important, source, for, personal, growth, unlike, freud, jung, did, not, consider, that, libido, alone, was, responsible, for, the, formation, of, the, core, personality, due, to, the, particular, hardships, jung, had, endured, growing, up, he, believed, his, personal, development, and, that, of, everyone, was, influenced, by, factors, unrelated, to, sexuality, the, overarching, aim, in, life, according, to, jungian, psychology, is, the, fullest, possible, actualisation, of, the, self, through, individuation, jung, defines, the, self, as, not, only, the, centre, but, also, the, whole, circumference, which, embraces, both, conscious, and, unconscious, it, is, the, centre, of, this, totality, just, as, the, ego, is, the, centre, of, the, conscious, mind, central, to, this, process, of, individuation, is, the, individual, s, continual, encounter, with, the, elements, of, the, psyche, by, bringing, them, into, consciousness, people, experience, the, unconscious, through, symbols, encountered, in, all, aspects, of, life, in, dreams, art, religion, and, the, symbolic, dramas, enacted, in, relationships, and, life, pursuits, essential, to, the, process, is, the, merging, of, the, individual, s, consciousness, with, the, collective, unconscious, through, a, huge, range, of, symbols, by, bringing, conscious, awareness, to, bear, on, what, is, unconscious, such, elements, can, be, integrated, with, consciousness, when, they, surface, to, proceed, with, the, individuation, process, individuals, need, to, be, open, to, the, parts, of, themselves, beyond, their, own, ego, which, is, the, organ, of, consciousness, in, a, famous, dictum, jung, said, the, self, like, the, unconscious, is, an, a, priori, existent, out, of, which, the, ego, evolves, it, is, an, unconscious, prefiguration, of, the, ego, it, is, not, i, who, create, myself, rather, i, happen, to, myself, it, follows, that, the, aim, of, jungian, psychotherapy, is, to, assist, the, individual, to, establish, a, healthy, relationship, with, the, unconscious, so, that, it, is, neither, excessively, out, of, balance, in, relation, to, it, as, in, neurosis, a, state, that, can, result, in, depression, anxiety, and, personality, disorders, or, so, flooded, by, it, that, it, risks, psychosis, resulting, in, mental, breakdown, one, method, jung, applied, to, his, patients, between, 1913, and, 1916, was, active, imagination, a, way, of, encouraging, them, to, give, themselves, over, to, a, form, of, meditation, to, release, apparently, random, images, from, the, mind, to, bridge, unconscious, contents, into, awareness, neurosis, in, jung, s, view, results, from, the, build, up, of, psychological, defences, the, individual, unconsciously, musters, in, an, effort, to, cope, with, perceived, attacks, from, the, outside, world, a, process, he, called, a, complex, although, complexes, are, not, merely, defensive, in, character, the, psyche, is, a, self, regulating, adaptive, system, people, are, energetic, systems, and, if, the, energy, is, blocked, the, psyche, becomes, sick, if, adaptation, is, thwarted, the, psychic, energy, stops, flowing, and, becomes, rigid, this, process, manifests, in, neurosis, and, psychosis, jung, proposed, that, this, occurs, through, maladaptation, of, one, s, internal, realities, to, external, ones, the, principles, of, adaptation, projection, and, compensation, are, central, processes, in, jung, s, view, of, psyche, s, attempts, to, adapt, jung, was, an, adept, principally, of, the, american, philosopher, william, james, founder, of, pragmatism, whom, he, met, during, his, trip, to, the, united, states, in, 1909, 255, he, also, encountered, other, figures, associated, with, james, such, as, john, dewey, and, the, anthropologist, franz, boas, 165, pragmatism, was, jung, s, favoured, route, to, base, his, psychology, on, a, sound, scientific, basis, according, to, historian, sonu, shamdasani, his, theories, consist, of, observations, of, phenomena, and, according, to, jung, it, is, phenomenology, in, his, view, psychologism, was, suspect, displacement, into, the, conceptual, deprives, experience, of, its, substance, and, the, possibility, of, being, simply, named, throughout, his, writings, jung, sees, in, empirical, observation, not, only, a, precondition, of, an, objective, method, but, also, respect, for, an, ethical, code, which, should, guide, the, psychologist, as, he, stated, in, a, letter, to, joseph, goldbrunner, i, consider, it, a, moral, obligation, not, to, make, assertions, about, things, one, cannot, see, or, whose, existence, cannot, be, proved, and, i, consider, it, an, abuse, of, epistemological, power, to, do, so, regardless, these, rules, apply, to, all, experimental, science, other, rules, apply, to, metaphysics, i, regard, myself, as, answerable, to, the, rules, of, experimental, science, as, a, result, nowhere, in, my, work, are, there, any, metaphysical, assertions, nor, nota, bene, any, negations, of, a, metaphysical, nature, according, to, the, italo, french, psychoanalyst, luigi, aurigemma, jung, s, reasoning, is, also, marked, by, immanuel, kant, and, more, generally, by, german, rationalist, philosophy, his, lectures, are, evidence, of, his, assimilation, of, kantian, thought, especially, the, critique, of, pure, reason, and, critique, of, practical, reason, aurigemma, characterises, jung, s, thinking, as, epistemological, relativism, because, it, does, not, postulate, any, belief, in, the, metaphysical, 19, in, fact, jung, uses, kant, s, teleology, to, bridle, his, thinking, and, to, guard, himself, from, straying, into, any, metaphysical, excursions, 21, on, the, other, hand, for, french, historian, of, psychology, fran, oise, parot, contrary, to, the, alleged, rationalist, vein, jung, is, heir, to, mystics, meister, eckhart, hildegard, of, bingen, or, augustine, of, hippo, 96, and, to, the, romantics, be, they, scientists, such, as, carl, gustav, carus, or, gotthilf, heinrich, von, schubert, in, particular, or, to, philosophers, and, writers, along, the, lines, of, nietzsche, goethe, and, schopenhauer, in, the, way, he, conceptualised, the, unconscious, in, particular, whereas, his, typology, is, profoundly, dependent, on, carl, spitteler, 255, as, a, trained, psychiatrist, jung, had, a, grounding, in, the, state, of, science, in, his, day, he, regularly, refers, to, the, experimental, psychology, of, wilhelm, wundt, his, word, association, test, designed, with, franz, riklin, is, actually, the, direct, application, of, wundt, s, theory, notwithstanding, the, great, debt, of, analytical, psychology, to, sigmund, freud, jung, borrowed, concepts, from, other, theories, of, his, time, for, instance, the, expression, abaissement, du, niveau, mental, comes, directly, from, the, french, psychologist, pierre, janet, whose, courses, jung, attended, during, his, studies, in, france, during, 1901, jung, had, always, acknowledged, how, much, janet, had, influenced, his, career, jung, s, use, of, the, concept, of, participation, mystique, is, owed, to, the, french, ethnologist, lucien, l, vy, bruhl, what, rousseau, describes, is, nothing, other, than, the, primitive, collective, mentality, which, lucien, l, vy, bruhl, has, brilliantly, called, participation, mystique, which, he, uses, to, illustrate, the, surprising, fact, to, him, that, some, native, peoples, can, experience, relations, that, defy, logic, as, for, instance, in, the, case, of, the, south, american, tribe, whom, he, met, during, his, travels, where, the, men, pretended, they, were, scarlet, aras, birds, finally, his, use, of, the, english, expression, pattern, of, behaviour, which, is, synonymous, with, the, term, archetype, is, drawn, from, british, studies, in, ethology, the, principal, contribution, to, analytical, psychology, nevertheless, remains, that, of, freud, s, psychoanalysis, from, which, jung, took, a, number, of, concepts, especially, the, method, of, inquiring, into, the, unconscious, through, free, association, individual, analysts, thinking, was, also, integrated, into, his, project, among, whom, are, s, ndor, ferenczi, jung, refers, to, his, notion, of, affect, or, ludwig, binswanger, and, his, daseinsanalyse, daseinsanalysis, jung, affirms, also, freud, s, contribution, to, our, knowledge, of, the, psyche, as, being, without, doubt, of, the, highest, importance, it, reveals, penetrating, information, about, the, dark, corners, of, the, soul, and, of, the, human, personality, which, is, of, the, same, order, as, nietzsche, s, on, the, genealogy, of, morality, 1887, in, this, context, freud, was, according, to, jung, one, of, the, great, cultural, critics, of, the, 19th, century, jungian, analysis, is, like, psychoanalysis, a, method, to, access, experience, and, integrate, unconscious, material, into, awareness, it, is, a, search, for, the, meaning, of, behaviours, feelings, and, events, many, are, the, channels, to, extend, knowledge, of, the, self, the, analysis, of, dreams, is, one, important, avenue, others, may, include, expressing, feelings, about, and, through, art, poetry, or, other, expressions, of, creativity, the, examination, of, conflicts, and, repeating, patterns, in, a, person, s, life, a, comprehensive, description, of, the, process, of, dream, interpretation, is, complex, in, that, it, is, highly, specific, to, the, person, who, undertakes, it, most, succinctly, it, relies, on, the, associations, which, the, particular, dream, symbols, suggest, to, the, dreamer, which, at, times, may, be, deemed, archetypal, in, so, far, as, they, are, supposed, common, to, many, people, throughout, history, examples, could, be, a, hero, an, old, man, or, woman, situations, of, pursuit, flying, or, falling, whereas, freudian, psychoanalysis, relies, entirely, on, the, development, of, the, transference, in, the, analysand, the, person, under, treatment, to, the, analyst, jung, initially, used, the, transference, and, later, concentrated, more, on, a, dialectical, and, didactic, approach, to, the, symbolic, and, archetypal, material, presented, by, the, patient, moreover, his, attitude, towards, patients, departed, from, what, he, had, observed, in, freud, s, method, anthony, stevens, has, explained, it, thus, in, place, of, freud, s, surgical, detachment, jung, demonstrated, a, more, relaxed, and, warmer, welcome, in, the, consulting, room, he, remained, aware, nonetheless, that, exposure, to, a, patient, s, unconscious, contents, always, posed, a, certain, risk, of, contagion, he, calls, it, psychic, infection, to, the, analyst, as, experienced, in, the, countertransference, the, process, of, contemporary, jungian, analysis, depends, on, the, type, of, school, of, analytical, psychology, to, which, the, therapist, adheres, see, below, the, zurich, school, would, reflect, the, approach, jung, himself, taught, while, those, influenced, by, michael, fordham, and, associates, in, london, would, be, significantly, closer, to, a, kleinian, approach, and, therefore, concerned, with, analysis, of, the, transference, and, countertransference, as, indicators, of, repressed, material, along, with, the, attendant, symbols, and, patterns, jung, s, preoccupation, with, dreams, can, be, dated, from, 1902, it, was, only, after, the, break, with, freud, that, he, published, in, 1916, his, psychology, of, the, unconscious, where, he, elaborated, his, view, of, dreams, which, contrasts, sharply, with, freud, s, conceptualisation, while, he, agrees, that, dreams, are, a, highway, into, the, unconscious, he, enlarges, on, their, functions, further, than, psychoanalysis, did, one, of, the, salient, differences, is, the, compensatory, function, they, perform, by, reinstating, psychic, equilibrium, in, respect, of, judgments, made, during, waking, life, thus, a, man, consumed, by, ambition, and, arrogance, may, for, example, dream, about, himself, as, small, and, vulnerable, person, according, to, jung, this, demonstrates, that, the, man, s, attitude, is, excessively, self, assured, and, thereby, refuses, to, integrate, the, inferior, aspects, of, his, personality, which, are, denied, by, his, defensive, arrogance, jung, calls, this, a, compensation, mechanism, necessary, for, the, maintenance, of, a, healthy, mental, balance, shortly, before, his, death, in, 1961, he, wrote, to, secure, mental, and, even, physiological, stability, it, is, necessary, that, the, conscious, and, unconscious, should, be, integrated, one, with, the, other, this, is, so, that, they, evolve, in, parallel, pour, sauvegarder, la, stabilit, mentale, et, m, me, physiologique, il, faut, que, la, conscience, et, l, inconscient, soient, int, gralement, reli, s, afin, d, voluer, parall, lement, unconscious, material, is, expressed, in, images, through, the, deployment, of, symbolism, which, in, jungian, terms, means, it, has, an, affective, role, in, that, it, can, sometimes, give, rise, to, a, numinous, feeling, when, associated, with, an, archetypal, force, and, an, intellectual, role, some, dreams, are, personal, to, the, dreamer, others, may, be, collective, in, origin, or, transpersonal, in, so, far, as, they, relate, to, existential, events, they, can, be, taken, to, express, phases, of, the, individuation, process, see, below, and, may, be, inspired, by, literature, art, alchemy, or, mythology, analytical, psychology, is, recognized, for, its, historical, and, geographical, study, of, myths, as, a, means, to, deconstruct, with, the, aid, of, symbols, the, unconscious, manifestations, of, the, psyche, myths, are, said, to, represent, directly, the, elements, and, phenomena, arising, from, the, collective, unconscious, and, though, they, may, be, subject, to, alteration, in, their, detail, through, time, their, significance, remains, similar, while, jung, relies, predominantly, on, christian, or, on, western, pagan, mythology, ancient, greece, and, rome, he, holds, that, the, unconscious, is, driven, by, mythologies, derived, from, all, cultures, he, evinced, an, interest, in, hinduism, in, zoroastrianism, and, taoism, which, all, share, fundamental, images, reflected, in, the, psyche, thus, analytical, psychology, focusses, on, meaning, based, on, the, hypothesis, that, human, beings, are, potentially, in, constant, touch, with, universal, and, symbolic, aspects, common, to, humankind, in, the, words, of, andr, nataf, jung, opens, psychoanalysis, to, a, dimension, currently, obscured, by, the, prevailing, scientism, spirituality, his, contribution, though, questionable, in, certain, respects, remains, unique, his, explorations, of, the, unconscious, carried, out, both, as, a, scientist, and, a, poet, indicate, that, it, is, structured, as, a, language, but, one, which, is, in, a, mythical, mode, jung, ouvre, la, psychanalyse, une, dimension, cach, e, par, le, scientisme, ambiant, la,

une, langue, mais, sur, le, mode, du, mythe, in, analytical, psychology, two, distinct, types, of, psychological, process, may, be, identified, that, deriving, from, the, individual, characterised, as, personal, belonging, to, a, subjective, psyche, and, that, deriving, from, the, collective, linked, to, the, structure, of, an, objective, psyche, which, may, be, termed, transpersonal, these, processes, are, both, said, to, be, archetypal, some, of, these, processes, are, regarded, as, specifically, linked, to, consciousness, such, as, the, animus, or, anima, the, persona, or, the, shadow, others, pertain, more, to, the, collective, sphere, jung, tended, to, personify, the, anima, and, animus, as, they, are, according, to, him, always, attached, to, a, person, and, represent, an, aspect, of, his, or, her, psyche, jung, identified, the, archetypal, anima, as, being, the, unconscious, feminine, component, of, men, and, the, archetypal, animus, as, the, unconscious, masculine, component, in, women, these, are, shaped, by, the, contents, of, the, collective, unconscious, by, others, and, by, the, larger, society, however, many, modern, day, jungian, practitioners, do, not, ascribe, to, a, literal, definition, citing, that, the, jungian, concept, points, to, every, person, having, both, an, anima, and, an, animus, jung, considered, for, instance, an, animus, of, the, anima, in, men, in, his, work, aion, and, in, an, interview, in, which, he, says, yes, if, a, man, realizes, the, animus, of, his, anima, then, the, animus, is, a, substitute, for, the, old, wise, man, you, see, his, ego, is, in, relation, to, the, unconscious, and, the, unconscious, is, personified, by, a, female, figure, the, anima, but, in, the, unconscious, is, also, a, masculine, figure, the, wise, old, man, and, that, figure, is, in, connection, with, the, anima, as, her, animus, because, she, is, a, woman, so, one, could, say, the, wise, old, man, was, in, exactly, the, same, position, as, the, animus, to, a, woman, jung, stated, that, the, anima, and, animus, act, as, guides, to, the, unconscious, unified, self, and, that, forming, an, awareness, and, a, connection, with, the, anima, or, animus, is, one, of, the, most, difficult, and, rewarding, steps, in, psychological, growth, jung, reported, that, he, identified, his, anima, as, she, spoke, to, him, as, an, inner, voice, unexpectedly, one, day, in, cases, where, the, anima, or, animus, complexes, are, ignored, they, vie, for, attention, by, projecting, itself, on, others, this, explains, according, to, jung, why, we, are, sometimes, immediately, attracted, to, certain, strangers, we, see, our, anima, or, animus, in, them, love, at, first, sight, is, an, example, of, anima, and, animus, projection, moreover, people, who, strongly, identify, with, their, gender, role, e, g, a, man, who, acts, aggressively, and, never, cries, have, not, actively, recognized, or, engaged, their, anima, or, animus, jung, attributes, human, rational, thought, to, be, the, male, nature, while, the, irrational, aspect, is, considered, to, be, natural, female, rational, being, defined, as, involving, judgment, irrational, being, defined, as, involving, perceptions, consequently, irrational, moods, are, the, progenies, of, the, male, anima, shadow, and, irrational, opinions, of, the, female, animus, shadow, the, use, of, archetypes, in, psychology, was, advanced, by, jung, in, an, essay, entitled, instinct, and, the, unconscious, in, 1919, the, first, element, in, greek, arche, signifies, beginning, origin, cause, primal, source, principle, by, extension, it, can, signify, position, of, a, leader, supreme, rule, and, government, the, second, element, type, means, blow, or, what, is, produced, by, a, blow, the, imprint, of, a, coin, form, image, prototype, model, order, and, norm, in, the, figurative, modern, sense, pattern, underlying, form, primordial, form, in, his, psychological, framework, archetypes, are, innate, universal, or, personal, prototypes, for, ideas, and, may, be, used, to, interpret, observations, the, method, he, favoured, was, hermeneutics, which, was, central, in, his, practice, of, psychology, from, the, start, he, made, explicit, references, to, hermeneutics, in, the, collected, works, and, during, his, theoretical, development, of, the, notion, of, archetypes, although, he, lacks, consistency, in, his, formulations, his, theoretical, development, of, archetypes, is, rich, in, hermeneutic, implications, as, noted, by, smythe, and, baydala, 2012, his, notion, of, the, archetype, as, such, can, be, understood, hermeneutically, as, a, form, of, non, conceptual, background, understanding, a, group, of, memories, and, attitudes, associated, with, an, archetype, can, become, a, complex, e, g, a, mother, complex, may, be, associated, with, a, particular, mother, archetype, jung, treated, the, archetypes, as, psychological, organs, analogous, to, physical, ones, in, that, both, are, morphological, givens, which, probably, arose, through, evolution, archetypes, have, been, regarded, as, collective, as, well, as, individual, and, identifiable, in, a, variety, of, creative, ways, as, an, example, in, his, book, memories, dreams, reflections, jung, states, that, he, began, to, see, and, talk, to, a, manifestation, of, anima, and, that, she, taught, him, how, to, interpret, dreams, as, soon, as, he, could, interpret, on, his, own, jung, said, that, she, ceased, talking, to, him, because, she, was, no, longer, needed, however, the, essentialism, inherent, in, archetypal, theory, in, general, and, concerning, the, anima, in, particular, has, called, for, a, re, evaluation, of, jung, s, theory, in, terms, of, emergence, theory, this, would, emphasise, the, role, of, symbols, in, the, construction, of, affect, in, the, midst, of, collective, human, action, in, such, a, reconfiguration, the, visceral, energy, of, a, numinous, experience, can, be, retained, while, the, problematic, theory, of, archetypes, has, outlived, its, usefulness, jung, s, concept, of, the, collective, unconscious, has, undergone, re, interpretation, over, time, the, term, collective, unconscious, first, appeared, in, jung, s, 1916, essay, the, structure, of, the, unconscious, this, essay, distinguishes, between, the, personal, freudian, unconscious, filled, with, fantasies, e, g, sexual, and, repressed, images, and, the, collective, unconscious, encompassing, the, soul, of, humanity, at, large, in, the, significance, of, constitution, and, heredity, in, psychology, november, 1929, jung, wrote, and, the, essential, thing, psychologically, is, that, in, dreams, fantasies, and, other, exceptional, states, of, mind, the, most, far, fetched, mythological, motifs, and, symbols, can, appear, autochthonously, at, any, time, often, apparently, as, the, result, of, particular, influences, traditions, and, excitations, working, on, the, individual, but, more, often, without, any, sign, of, them, these, primordial, images, or, archetypes, as, i, have, called, them, belong, to, the, basic, stock, of, the, unconscious, psyche, and, cannot, be, explained, as, personal, acquisitions, together, they, make, up, that, psychic, stratum, which, has, been, called, the, collective, unconscious, the, existence, of, the, collective, unconscious, means, that, individual, consciousness, is, anything, but, a, tabula, rasa, and, is, not, immune, to, predetermining, influences, on, the, contrary, it, is, in, the, highest, degree, influenced, by, inherited, presuppositions, quite, apart, from, the, unavoidable, influences, exerted, upon, it, by, the, environment, the, collective, unconscious, comprises, in, itself, the, psychic, life, of, our, ancestors, right, back, to, the, earliest, beginnings, it, is, the, matrix, of, all, conscious, psychic, occurrences, and, hence, it, exerts, an, influence, that, compromises, the, freedom, of, consciousness, in, the, highest, degree, since, it, is, continually, striving, to, lead, all, conscious, processes, back, into, the, old, paths, given, that, in, his, day, he, lacked, the, advances, of, complexity, theory, and, especially, complex, adaptive, systems, cas, it, has, been, argued, that, his, vision, of, archetypes, as, a, stratum, in, the, collective, unconscious, corresponds, to, nodal, patterns, in, the, collective, unconscious, which, go, on, to, shape, the, characteristic, patterns, of, human, imagination, and, experience, and, in, that, sense, seems, a, remarkable, intuitive, articulation, of, the, cas, model, individuation, is, a, complex, process, that, involves, going, through, different, stages, of, growing, awareness, through, the, progressive, confrontation, and, integration, of, personal, unconscious, elements, this, is, the, central, concept, of, analytical, psychology, first, introduced, in, 1916, it, is, the, objective, of, jungian, psychotherapy, to, the, extent, that, it, enables, the, realisation, of, the, self, as, jung, stated, the, aim, of, individuation, is, nothing, less, than, to, divest, the, self, of, the, false, wrappings, of, the, persona, on, the, one, hand, and, the, suggestive, power, of, primordial, images, on, the, other, jung, started, experimenting, with, individuation, after, his, split, with, freud, as, he, confronted, what, was, described, as, eruptions, from, the, collective, unconscious, driven, by, a, contemporary, malaise, of, spiritual, alienation, according, to, jung, individuation, means, becoming, an, individual, and, implies, becoming, one, s, own, self, unlike, individuality, which, emphasizes, some, supposed, peculiarity, jung, described, individuation, as, a, better, and, more, complete, fulfillment, of, the, collective, qualities, of, the, human, being, in, his, experience, jung, explained, that, individuation, helped, him, from, the, therapeutic, point, of, view, to, find, the, particular, images, that, lie, behind, emotions, individuation, is, from, the, first, what, the, analysand, must, undergo, to, integrate, the, other, elements, of, the, psyche, 35, this, pursuit, of, wholeness, aims, to, establish, the, self, which, include, both, the, rational, conscious, mind, of, the, ego, and, the, irrational, contents, of, the, unconscious, as, the, new, personality, center, prior, to, individuation, the, analysand, is, carefully, assessed, to, determine, if, the, ego, is, strong, enough, to, take, the, intensity, of, this, process, the, elements, to, be, integrated, include, the, persona, which, acts, as, the, representative, of, the, person, in, her, his, role, in, society, the, shadow, which, contains, all, that, is, personally, unknown, and, what, the, person, considers, morally, reprehensible, and, the, anima, or, the, animus, which, respectively, carry, their, feminine, and, masculine, values, for, jung, many, unconscious, conflicts, at, the, root, of, neurosis, are, caused, by, the, difficulty, to, accept, that, such, a, dynamic, can, unbalance, the, subject, from, his, habitual, position, and, confronts, her, him, with, aspects, of, the, self, they, were, accustomed, to, ignore, once, individuation, is, completed, the, ego, is, no, longer, at, the, centre, of, the, personality, the, process, however, does, not, lead, to, a, complete, self, realization, and, that, individuation, can, never, be, a, fixed, state, due, to, the, unfathomable, nature, of, the, depths, of, the, collective, unconscious, the, shadow, is, an, unconscious, complex, defined, as, the, repressed, suppressed, or, disowned, qualities, of, the, conscious, self, according, to, jung, the, human, being, deals, with, the, reality, of, the, shadow, in, four, ways, denial, projection, integration, and, or, transmutation, jung, himself, asserted, that, the, result, of, the, freudian, method, of, elucidation, is, a, minute, elaboration, of, man, s, shadow, side, unexampled, in, any, previous, age, 63, according, to, analytical, psychology, a, person, s, shadow, may, have, both, constructive, and, destructive, aspects, in, its, more, destructive, aspects, the, shadow, can, represent, those, things, people, do, not, accept, about, themselves, for, instance, the, shadow, of, someone, who, identifies, as, being, kind, may, be, harsh, or, unkind, conversely, the, shadow, of, a, person, who, perceives, himself, to, be, brutal, may, be, gentle, in, its, more, constructive, aspects, a, person, s, shadow, may, represent, hidden, positive, qualities, this, has, been, referred, to, as, the, gold, in, the, shadow, jung, emphasized, the, importance, of, being, aware, of, shadow, material, and, incorporating, it, into, conscious, awareness, to, avoid, projecting, shadow, qualities, on, others, the, shadow, in, dreams, is, often, represented, by, dark, figures, of, the, same, gender, as, the, dreamer, the, shadow, may, also, concern, great, figures, in, the, history, of, human, thought, or, even, spiritual, masters, who, became, great, because, of, their, shadows, or, because, of, their, ability, to, live, their, shadows, namely, their, unconscious, faults, in, full, without, repressing, them, just, like, the, anima, and, animus, the, persona, derived, from, the, latin, term, for, a, mask, as, would, have, been, worn, by, actors, is, another, key, concept, in, analytical, psychology, it, is, the, part, of, the, personality, which, manages, an, individual, s, relations, with, society, in, the, outside, world, and, works, the, same, way, for, both, sexes, the, persona, is, the, individual, s, system, of, adaptation, to, or, the, manner, assumed, in, dealing, with, the, world, every, calling, or, profession, for, example, has, its, own, characteristic, persona, only, the, danger, is, that, people, become, identical, with, their, personas, thus, the, professor, with, his, textbook, the, tenor, with, his, voice, one, could, say, with, little, exaggeration, that, the, persona, is, that, which, in, reality, one, is, not, but, which, oneself, as, well, as, others, think, one, is, 415, 416, the, persona, which, is, at, the, heart, of, the, psyche, is, contrary, to, the, shadow, which, is, actually, the, true, personality, but, denied, by, the, self, the, conscious, self, identifies, primarily, with, the, persona, during, development, in, childhood, as, the, individual, develops, a, psychological, framework, for, dealing, with, others, identifications, with, diplomas, social, roles, with, honours, and, awards, with, a, career, all, contribute, to, the, apparent, constitution, of, the, persona, and, which, do, not, lead, to, knowledge, of, the, self, for, jung, the, persona, has, nothing, real, about, it, it, can, only, be, a, compromise, between, the, individual, and, society, yielding, an, illusion, of, individuality, individuation, consists, in, the, first, instance, of, discarding, the, individual, s, mask, but, not, too, quickly, as, often, it, is, all, the, patient, has, as, a, means, of, identification, the, persona, is, implicated, in, a, number, of, symptoms, such, as, compulsive, disorders, phobias, shifting, moods, and, addictions, among, others, analytical, psychology, distinguishes, several, psychological, types, or, temperaments, according, to, jung, the, psyche, is, an, apparatus, for, adaptation, and, orientation, and, consists, of, a, number, of, different, psychic, functions, among, these, he, distinguishes, four, basic, functions, early, in, jung, s, career, he, coined, the, term, and, described, the, concept, of, the, complex, jung, claims, to, have, discovered, the, concept, during, his, free, association, and, galvanic, skin, response, experiments, freud, obviously, took, up, this, concept, in, his, oedipus, complex, amongst, others, jung, seemed, to, see, complexes, as, quite, autonomous, parts, of, psychological, life, it, is, almost, as, if, jung, were, describing, separate, personalities, within, what, is, considered, a, single, individual, but, to, equate, jung, s, use, of, complexes, with, something, along, the, lines, of, multiple, personality, disorder, would, be, a, step, out, of, bounds, jung, saw, an, archetype, as, always, being, the, central, organizing, structure, of, a, complex, for, instance, in, a, negative, mother, complex, the, archetype, of, the, negative, mother, would, be, seen, to, be, central, to, the, identity, of, that, complex, this, is, to, say, our, psychological, lives, are, patterned, on, common, human, experiences, jung, saw, the, ego, which, freud, wrote, about, in, german, literally, as, the, i, one, s, conscious, experience, of, oneself, as, a, complex, if, the, i, is, a, complex, what, might, be, the, archetype, that, structures, it, jung, and, many, jungians, might, say, the, hero, one, who, separates, from, the, community, to, ultimately, carry, the, community, further, jung, first, officially, used, the, term, synchronicity, during, a, conference, held, in, memory, of, his, sinologist, friend, richard, wilhelm, in, 1930, it, was, part, of, his, explanation, of, the, modus, operandi, of, the, i, ching, the, second, reference, was, made, in, 1935, in, his, tavistock, lectures, for, an, overview, of, the, origins, of, the, concept, see, joseph, cambray, synchronicity, as, emergence, it, was, used, to, denote, the, simultaneous, occurrence, of, two, events, with, no, causal, physical, connection, but, whose, association, evokes, a, meaning, for, the, person, experiencing, or, observing, it, the, often, cited, example, of, the, phenomenon, is, jung, s, own, account, of, a, beetle, the, common, rose, chafer, cetonia, aurata, flying, into, his, consulting, room, directly, following, on, from, his, patient, telling, him, a, dream, featuring, a, golden, scarab, the, concept, only, makes, sense, psychologically, and, cannot, be, reduced, to, a, verified, or, scientific, fact, for, jung, it, constitutes, a, working, hypothesis, which, has, subsequently, given, rise, to, many, ambiguities, i, chose, this, term, because, the, simultaneous, occurrence, of, two, meaningfully, but, not, causally, connected, events, seemed, to, me, an, essential, criterion, i, am, therefore, using, the, general, concept, of, synchronicity, in, the, special, sense, of, a, coincidence, in, time, of, two, or, more, causally, unrelated, events, which, have, the, same, or, a, similar, meaning, in, contrast, to, synchronism, which, simply, means, the, simultaneous, occurrence, of, two, events, synchronicity, therefore, means, the, simultaneous, occurrence, of, a, certain, psychic, state, with, one, or, more, external, events, which, appear, as, meaningful, parallels, to, the, momentary, subjective, state, and, in, certain, cases, vice, versa, according, to, jung, an, archetype, which, has, been, constellated, in, the, psyche, can, under, certain, circumstances, transgress, the, boundary, between, substance, and, psyche, jung, had, studied, such, phenomena, with, the, physicist, and, nobel, prize, winner, wolfgang, pauli, who, did, not, always, agree, with, jung, and, with, whom, he, carried, on, an, extensive, correspondence, enriched, by, the, contributions, of, both, specialists, in, their, own, fields, pauli, had, given, a, series, of, lectures, to, the, c, g, jung, institute, z, rich, whose, member, and, patron, he, had, been, since, 1947, it, gave, rise, to, a, joint, essay, synchronicity, an, a, causal, principle, 1952, the, two, men, saw, in, the, idea, of, synchronicity, a, potential, way, of, explaining, a, particular, relationship, between, incontrovertible, facts, whose, occurrence, is, tied, to, unconscious, and, archetypal, manifestations, the, psyche, and, matter, are, ordered, according, to, principles, which, are, common, neutral, and, incontrovertible, borrowing, the, notion, from, arthur, schopenhauer, jung, calls, it, unus, mundus, a, state, where, neither, matter, nor, the, psyche, are, distinguishable, whereas, for, pauli, it, was, a, limiting, concept, in, two, senses, in, that, it, is, at, once, scientific, and, symbolic, according, to, him, the, phenomenon, is, dependent, on, the, observer, nevertheless, both, men, were, in, accord, that, there, existed, the, possibility, of, a, conjunction, between, physics, and, psychology, jung, wrote, in, a, letter, to, pauli, these, researches, jung, s, research, into, alchemy, have, shown, me, that, modern, physics, can, symbolically, represent, psychological, processes, down, to, the, minutest, detail, marie, louise, von, franz, also, had, a, lengthy, exchange, of, letters, with, wolfgang, pauli, on, pauli, s, death, in, 1958, his, widow, franca, deliberately, destroyed, all, the, letters, von, franz, had, sent, to, her, husband, and, which, he, had, kept, locked, inside, his, writing, desk, however, the, letters, from, pauli, to, von, franz, were, all, saved, and, were, later, made, available, to, researchers, and, published, synchronicity, is, among, the, most, developed, ideas, by, jung, s, followers, notably, by, michel, cazenave, james, hillman, roderick, main, carl, alfred, meier, and, by, the, british, developmental, clinician, george, bright, it, has, been, explored, also, in, a, range, of, spiritual, currents, who, have, sought, in, it, a, scientific, rigour, although, synchronicity, as, conceived, by, jung, within, the, bounds, of, the, science, available, in, his, day, has, been, categorised, as, pseudoscience, recent, developments, in, complex, adaptive, systems, argue, for, a, revision, of, such, a, view, critics, cite, that, jung, s, experiments, that, sought, to, provide, statistical, proof, for, this, theory, did, not, yield, satisfactory, result, his, experiment, was, also, faulted, for, not, using, a, true, random, sampling, method, as, well, as, for, the, use, of, dubious, statistics, and, astrological, material, andrew, samuels, 1985, has, distinguished, three, distinct, traditions, or, approaches, of, post, jungian, psychology, classical, developmental, and, archetypal, today, there, are, more, developments, the, classical, approach, tries, to, remain, faithful, to, jung, s, proposed, model, his, teachings, and, the, substance, of, his, 20, volume, collected, works, together, with, recently, published, works, such, as, the, liber, novus, and, the, black, books, prominent, advocates, of, this, approach, according, to, samuels, 1985, include, emma, jung, jung, s, wife, an, analyst, in, her, own, right, marie, louise, von, franz, joseph, l, henderson, aniela, jaff, erich, neumann, gerhard, adler, and, jolande, jacobi, jung, credited, neumann, author, of, origins, of, conscious, and, origins, of, the, child, as, his, principal, student, to, advance, his, jung, s, theory, into, a, mythology, based, approach, he, is, associated, with, developing, the, symbolism, and, archetypal, significance, of, several, myths, the, child, creation, the, hero, the, great, mother, and, transcendence, one, archetypal, approach, sometimes, called, the, imaginal, school, by, james, hillman, was, written, about, by, him, in, the, late, 1960s, and, early, 1970s, its, adherents, according, to, samuels, 1985, include, gerhard, adler, irene, claremont, de, castillejo, adolf, guggenb, hl, craig, murray, stein, rafael, l, pez, pedraza, and, wolfgang, giegerich, thomas, moore, also, was, influenced, by, some, of, hillman, s, work, developed, independently, other, psychoanalysts, have, created, strong, approaches, to, archetypal, psychology, mythopoeticists, and, psychoanalysts, such, as, clarissa, pinkola, est, s, who, believes, that, ethnic, and, aboriginal, people, are, the, originators, of, archetypal, psychology, and, have, long, carried, the, maps, for, the, journey, of, the, soul, in, their, songs, tales, dream, telling, art, and, rituals, marion, woodman, who, proposes, a, feminist, viewpoint, regarding, archetypal, psychology, some, of, the, mythopoetic, archetypal, psychology, creators, either, imagine, the, self, not, to, be, the, main, archetype, of, the, collective, unconscious, as, jung, thought, but, rather, assign, each, archetype, equal, value, others, who, are, modern, progenitors, of, archetypal, psychology, such, as, est, s, think, of, the, self, as, the, thing, that, contains, and, yet, is, suffused, by, all, other, archetypes, each, giving, life, to, the, other, robert, l, moore, has, explored, the, archetypal, level, of, the, human, psyche, in, a, series, of, five, books, co, authored, with, douglas, gillette, which, have, played, an, important, role, in, the, men, s, movement, in, the, united, states, moore, studies, computerese, so, he, uses, a, computer, s, hard, wiring, its, fixed, physical, components, as, a, metaphor, for, the, archetypal, level, of, the, human, psyche, personal, experiences, influence, the, access, to, the, archetypal, level, of, the, human, psyche, but, personalized, ego, consciousness, can, be, likened, to, computer, software, in, the, 21st, century, jordan, peterson, is, a, prominent, jungian, psychologist, whose, extensive, work, maps, of, meaning, is, centred, around, the, theories, of, jungian, archetypes, a, major, expansion, of, jungian, theory, is, credited, to, michael, fordham, and, his, wife, frieda, fordham, it, can, be, considered, a, bridge, between, traditional, jungian, analysis, and, melanie, klein, s, object, relations, theory, judith, hubback, and, william, goodheart, md, are, also, included, in, this, group, andrew, samuels, 1985, considers, j, w, t, redfearn, richard, carvalho, and, himself, as, representatives, of, the, developmental, approach, samuels, notes, how, this, approach, differs, from, the, classical, by, giving, less, emphasis, to, the, self, and, more, emphasis, to, the, development, of, personality, he, also, notes, how, in, terms, of, practice, in, therapy, it, gives, more, attention, to, transference, and, counter, transference, than, either, the, classical, or, the, archetypal, approaches, sandplay, is, a, non, directive, creative, form, of, therapy, using, the, imagination, originally, used, with, children, and, adolescents, later, also, with, adults, jung, had, stressed, the, importance, of, finding, the, image, behind, the, emotion, the, use, of, sand, in, a, suitable, tray, with, figurines, and, other, small, toys, farm, animals, trees, fences, and, cars, enables, a, narrative, to, develop, through, a, series, of, scenarios, this, is, said, to, express, an, ongoing, dialogue, between, the, conscious, and, the, unconscious, aspects, of, the, psyche, which, in, turn, activates, a, healing, process, whereby, the, patient, and, therapist, can, together, view, the, evolving, sense, of, self, jungian, sandplay, started, as, a, therapeutic, method, in, the, 1950s, although, its, origin, has, been, credited, to, a, swiss, jungian, analyst, dora, kalff, it, was, in, fact, her, mentor, and, trainer, dr, margaret, lowenfeld, a, british, paediatrician, who, had, developed, the, lowenfeld, world, technique, inspired, by, the, writer, h, g, wells, in, her, work, with, children, using, a, sand, tray, and, figurines, in, the, 1930s, jung, had, witnessed, a, demonstration, of, the, technique, while, on, a, visit, to, the, uk, in, 1937, kalff, saw, in, it, potential, as, a, further, application, of, analytical, psychology, encouraged, by, jung, kalff, developed, the, new, application, over, a, number, of, years, and, called, it, sandplay, from, 1962, she, began, to, train, jungian, analysts, in, the, method, including, in, the, united, states, europe, and, japan, both, kalff, and, jung, believed, an, image, can, offer, greater, therapeutic, engagement, and, insight, than, words, alone, through, the, sensory, experience, of, working, with, sand, and, objects, and, their, symbolic, resonance, new, areas, of, awareness, can, be, brought, into, consciousness, as, in, dreams, which, through, their, frames, and, storyline, can, bring, material, into, consciousness, as, part, of, an, integrating, and, healing, process, the, historian, of, psychology, sonu, shamdasani, has, commented, historical, reflection, suggests, the, spirit, of, jung, s, practice, of, the, image, his, engagement, with, his, own, figures, is, indeed, more, alive, in, sandplay, than, in, other, jungian, conclaves, one, of, dora, kalff, s, trainees, was, the, american, concert, pianist, joel, ryce, menuhin, whose, music, career, was, ended, by, illness, and, who, retrained, as, a, jungian, analyst, and, exponent, of, sandplay, process, oriented, psychology, also, called, process, work, is, associated, with, the, zurich, trained, jungian, analyst, arnold, mindell, process, work, developed, in, the, late, 1970s, and, early, 1980s, and, was, originally, identified, as, a, daughter, of, jungian, psychology, process, work, stresses, awareness, of, the, unconscious, as, an, ongoing, flow, of, experience, this, approach, expands, jung, s, work, beyond, verbal, individual, therapy, to, include, body, experience, altered, and, comatose, states, as, well, as, multicultural, group, work, formally, jungian, analysis, differs, little, from, psychoanalysis, however, variants, of, each, school, have, developed, overlaps, and, specific, divergences, through, the, century, or, more, of, their, existence, they, share, a, frame,

dreams, is, one, of, the, central, pillars, of, jungian, psychotherapy, in, all, other, respects, the, rules, correspond, to, those, of, classical, psychoanalysis, the, analyst, examines, free, associations, and, tries, to, be, objective, and, ethical, meaning, respectful, of, the, patient, s, pace, and, rhythm, of, unfolding, progress, in, fact, the, task, of, jungian, analysis, is, not, merely, to, explore, the, patient, s, past, but, to, connect, conscious, awareness, with, the, unconscious, such, that, a, better, adaptation, to, their, emotional, and, social, life, may, ensue,

unconscious, processes, enacted, in, the, transference, provoke, a, dependent, relationship, by, the, analysand, on, the, analyst, leading, to, a, falling, away, of, the, usual, defences, and, references, this, requires, that, the, analyst, guarantee, the, safety, of, the, transference, the, responsibilities, and, accountability, of, individual, analysts, and, their, membership, organisations, matters, of, clinical, confidentiality, and, codes, of, ethics, and, professional, relations, with, the, public, sphere, are, explored, in, a, volume, edited, by, solomon, and, twyman, with, contributions, from, jungian, analysts, and, psychoanalysts, solomon, has, characterised, the, nature, of, the, patient, analyst, relationship, as, one, where, the, analytic, attitude, is, an, ethical, attitude, since, the, ethical, attitude, presupposes, special, responsibilities, that, we, choose, to, adopt, in, relation, to, another, thus, a, parallel, situation, pertains, between, caregiver, and, child, and, between, analyst, and, patient, they, are, not, equal, partners, but, nevertheless, are, in, a, situation, of, mutuality, shared, subjectivity, and, reciprocal, influence, analytical, psychology, has, inspired, a, number, of, contemporary, academic, researchers, to, revisit, some, of, jung, s, own, preoccupations, with, the, role, of, women, in, society, with, philosophy, and, with, literary, and, art, criticism, leading, figures, to, explore, these, fields, include, the, british, american, susan, rowland, who, produced, the, first, feminist, revision, of, jung, and, the, fundamental, contributions, made, to, his, work, by, the, creative, women, who, surrounded, him, she, has, continued, to, mine, his, work, by, evaluating, his, influence, on, modern, literary, criticism, and, as, a, writer, leslie, gardner, has, devoted, a, series, of, volumes, to, analytical, psychology, in, 21st, century, life, one, of, which, concentrates, on, the, feminine, self, paul, bishop, a, british, german, scholar, has, placed, analytical, psychology, in, the, context, of, precursors, such, as, goethe, schiller, and, nietzsche, the, franco, swiss, art, historian, and, analytical, psychologist, christian, gaillard, has, examined, jung, s, place, as, an, artist, and, art, critic, in, his, series, of, fay, lectures, at, the, texas, a, m, university, these, scholars, draw, from, jung, s, works, that, apply, analytical, psychology, to, literature, such, as, the, lecture, on, the, relation, of, analytical, psychology, to, poetry, in, this, presentation, which, was, delivered, in, 1922, jung, stated, that, the, psychologist, cannot, replace, the, art, critic, he, rejected, the, freudian, art, criticism, for, reducing, complex, works, of, art, to, oedipal, fantasies, of, their, creators, stressing, the, danger, of, simplifying, literature, to, causes, found, outside, of, the, actual, work, since, its, inception, analytical, psychology, has, been, the, object, of, criticism, emanating, from, the, psychoanalytic, sphere, freud, himself, characterised, jung, as, a, mystic, and, a, snob, in, his, introduction, to, the, 2011, edition, of, jung, s, lectures, on, the, theory, of, psychoanalysis, given, in, new, york, city, in, 1912, sonu, shamdasani, contends, that, freud, orchestrated, a, round, of, critical, reviews, of, jung, s, writings, from, karl, abraham, jung, s, former, colleague, at, the, burgh, lzli, hospital, and, from, the, early, welsh, freudian, ernest, jones, such, criticisms, multiplied, during, the, 20th,

ideas, and, abstractions, in, a, world, of, books, and, old, secrets, lost, in, ancient, books, of, spells, fr, grimoires, while, claiming, to, be, an, empiricist, amselek, finds, jung, to, be, an, idealist, a, pure, thinker, who, has, unquestionably, demonstrated, his, intellectual, talent, for, speculation, and, the, invention, of, ideas, while, he, considers, his, epistemology, to, be, in,
