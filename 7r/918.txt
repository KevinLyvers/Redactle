of, coercive, force, kept, unwilling, conscripts, in, check, and, controlled, rates, of, desertion, have, been, overstated, and, that, any, pay, or, other, remuneration, for, service, as, provided, then, would, have, been, an, insufficient, incentive, instead, old, regime, common, soldiers, should, be, viewed, primarily, as, willing, participants, who, saw, themselves, as, engaged, in, a, distinct, and, honourable, activity, in, modern, times, soldiers, have, volunteered, for, armed, service, especially, in, time, of, war, out, of, a, sense, of, patriotic, duty, to, their, homeland, or, to, advance, a, social, political, or, ideological, cause, while, improved, levels, of, remuneration, or, training, might, be, more, of, an, incentive, in, times, of, economic, hardship, soldiers, might, also, enlist, for, personal, reasons, such, as, following, family, or, social, expectations, or, for, the, order, and, discipline, provided, by, military, training, as, well, as, for, the,

join, the, army, for, family, institutional, and, occupational, reasons, and, many, value, the, opportunity, to, become, a, military, professional, they, value, their, relationships, with, other, soldiers, enjoy, their, social, lives, and, are, satisfied, with, army, life, however, the, authors, cautioned, that, the, survey, sample, consisted, of, only, 81, soldiers, and, that, the, findings, of, this, study, cannot, be, generalized, to, the, u, s, army, as, a, whole, or, to, any, rank, the, length, of, time, that, an, individual, is, required, to, serve, as, a, soldier, has, varied, with, country, and, historical, period, whether, that, individual, has, been, drafted, or, has, voluntarily, enlisted, such, service, depending, on, the, army, s, need, for, staffing, or, the, individual, s, fitness, and, eligibility, may, involve, fulfillment, of, a, contractual, obligation, that, obligation, might, extend, for, the, duration, of, an, armed, conflict, or, may, be, limited, to, a, set,

narrative, fiction, drama, films, and, more, recently, television, and, video, comic, books, graphic, novels, and, games, often, these, portrayals, have, emphasized, the, heroic, qualities, of,
