the, s, mi, s, m, i, sah, mee, also, spelled, sami, or, saami, are, the, traditionally, s, mi, speaking, indigenous, peoples, inhabiting, the, region, of, s, pmi, which, today, encompasses, large, northern, parts, of, norway, sweden, finland, and, of, the, kola, peninsula, in, russia, the, region, of, s, pmi, was, formerly, known, as, lapland, and, the, s, mi, have, historically, been, known, in, english, as, lapps, or, laplanders, but, these, terms, are, regarded, as, offensive, by, the, s, mi, who, prefer, their, own, endonym, e, g, northern, s, mi, s, pmi, their, traditional, languages, are, the, s, mi, languages, which, are, classified, as, a, branch, of, the, uralic, language, family, traditionally, the, s, mi, have, pursued, a, variety, of, livelihoods, including, coastal, fishing, fur, trapping, and, sheep, herding, their, best, known, means, of, livelihood, is, semi, nomadic, reindeer, herding, as, of, 2007, about, 10, of, the, s, mi, were, connected, to, reindeer, herding, which, provides, them, with, meat, fur, and, transportation, around, 2, 800, s, mi, people, were, actively, involved, in, reindeer, herding, on, a, full, time, basis, in, norway, for, traditional, environmental, cultural, and, political, reasons, reindeer, herding, is, legally, reserved, for, only, s, mi, in, some, regions, of, the, nordic, countries, speakers, of, northern, s, mi, refer, to, themselves, as, s, mit, the, s, mis, or, s, pmela, of, s, mi, kin, the, word, s, pmi, being, inflected, into, various, grammatical, forms, other, s, mi, languages, use, cognate, words, as, of, around, 2014, the, current, consensus, among, specialists, was, that, the, word, s, mi, was, borrowed, from, the, proto, baltic, word, m, meaning, land, cognate, with, slavic, zemlja, of, the, same, meaning, the, word, s, mi, has, at, least, one, cognate, word, in, finnish, proto, baltic, m, was, also, borrowed, into, proto, finnic, as, m, this, word, became, modern, finnish, h, me, finnish, for, the, region, of, tavastia, the, second, of, m, is, still, found, in, the, adjective, h, m, l, inen, the, finnish, word, for, finland, suomi, is, also, thought, probably, to, derive, ultimately, from, proto, baltic, m, though, the, precise, route, is, debated, and, proposals, usually, involve, complex, processes, of, borrowing, and, reborrowing, suomi, and, its, adjectival, form, suom, a, lainen, must, come, from, s, me, s, ma, in, one, proposal, this, finnish, word, comes, from, a, proto, germanic, word, s, ma, itself, from, proto, baltic, s, ma, in, turn, borrowed, from, proto, finnic, m, which, was, borrowed, from, m, the, s, mi, institutions, notably, the, parliaments, radio, and, tv, stations, theatres, etc, all, use, the, term, s, mi, including, when, addressing, outsiders, in, norwegian, swedish, finnish, or, english, in, norwegian, and, swedish, the, s, mi, are, today, referred, to, by, the, localized, form, same, the, first, probable, historical, mention, of, the, s, mi, naming, them, fenni, was, by, tacitus, about, ad, 98, variants, of, finn, or, fenni, were, in, wide, use, in, ancient, times, judging, from, the, names, fenni, and, phinnoi, in, classical, roman, and, greek, works, finn, or, variants, such, as, skridfinn, skiing, finn, was, the, name, originally, used, by, norse, speakers, and, their, proto, norse, speaking, ancestors, to, refer, to, the, s, mi, as, attested, in, the, icelandic, eddas, and, norse, sagas, 11th, to, 14th, centuries, the, etymology, is, somewhat, uncertain, but, the, consensus, seems, to, be, that, it, is, related, to, old, norse, finna, from, proto, germanic, fin, anan, to, find, the, logic, being, that, the, s, mi, as, hunter, gatherers, found, their, food, rather, than, grew, it, this, etymology, has, superseded, older, speculations, that, the, word, might, be, related, to, fen, as, old, norse, gradually, developed, into, the, separate, scandinavian, languages, swedes, apparently, took, to, using, finn, to, refer, to, inhabitants, of, what, is, now, finland, while, the, s, mi, came, to, be, called, lapps, in, norway, however, s, mi, were, still, called, finns, at, least, until, the, modern, era, reflected, in, toponyms, like, finnmark, finnsnes, finnfjord, and, finn, y, and, some, northern, norwegians, will, still, occasionally, use, finn, to, refer, to, s, mi, people, although, the, s, mi, themselves, now, consider, this, to, be, an, inappropriate, term, finnish, immigrants, to, northern, norway, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, were, referred, to, as, kvens, to, distinguish, them, from, the, s, mi, finns, ethnic, finns, suomalaiset, are, a, group, related, to, the, s, mi, but, distinct, from, them, the, word, lapp, can, be, traced, to, old, swedish, lapper, icelandic, lappir, plural, perhaps, of, finnish, origin, compare, finnish, lappalainen, lapp, lappi, lapland, possibly, meaning, wilderness, in, the, north, the, original, meaning, being, unknown, it, is, unknown, how, the, word, lapp, came, into, the, norse, language, but, one, of, the, first, written, mentions, of, the, term, is, in, the, gesta, danorum, by, the, twelfth, century, danish, historian, saxo, grammaticus, who, referred, to, the, two, lappias, although, he, still, referred, to, the, s, mi, as, skrid, finn, s, in, fact, saxo, never, explicitly, connects, the, s, mi, with, the, two, laplands, the, term, lapp, was, popularized, and, became, the, standard, terminology, by, the, work, of, johannes, schefferus, acta, lapponica, 1673, the, s, mi, are, often, known, in, other, languages, by, the, exonyms, lap, lapp, or, laplanders, although, these, are, considered, derogatory, terms, by, some, while, others, accept, at, least, the, name, lappland, variants, of, the, name, lapp, were, originally, used, in, sweden, and, finland, and, through, swedish, adopted, by, many, major, european, languages, english, lapps, german, dutch, lappen, french, lapons, greek, l, p, nes, hungarian, lappok, italian, lapponi, polish, lapo, czycy, portuguese, lap, es, spanish, lapones, romanian, laponi, turkish, lapon, in, russian, the, corresponding, term, is, lopari, and, in, ukrainian, lopari, in, finland, and, sweden, lapp, is, common, in, place, names, such, as, lappi, satakunta, lappeenranta, south, karelia, and, lapinlahti, north, savo, in, finland, and, lapp, stockholm, county, lappe, s, dermanland, and, lappabo, sm, land, in, sweden, as, already, mentioned, finn, is, a, common, element, in, norwegian, particularly, northern, norwegian, place, names, whereas, lapp, is, exceedingly, rare, terminological, issues, in, finnish, are, somewhat, different, finns, living, in, finnish, lapland, generally, call, themselves, lapp, i, lainen, whereas, the, similar, word, for, the, s, mi, people, is, lapp, a, lainen, this, can, be, confusing, for, foreign, visitors, because, of, the, similar, lives, finns, and, s, mi, people, live, today, in, lapland, lappalainen, is, also, a, common, family, name, in, finland, in, finnish, saamelainen, is, the, most, commonly, used, word, nowadays, especially, in, official, contexts, the, western, uralic, languages, are, believed, to, have, spread, from, the, original, proto, uralic, homeland, along, the, volga, which, is, the, longest, river, in, europe, the, speakers, of, finnic, and, s, mi, languages, have, their, roots, in, the, middle, and, upper, volga, region, in, the, corded, ware, culture, these, groups, presumably, started, to, move, to, the, northwest, from, the, homeland, of, the, early, uralic, peoples, in, the, second, and, third, quarters, of, the, 2nd, millennium, bc, on, their, journey, they, used, the, ancient, river, routes, of, northern, russia, some, of, these, peoples, who, may, have, originally, spoken, the, same, western, uralic, language, stopped, and, stayed, in, the, regions, between, karelia, ladoga, and, lake, ilmen, and, even, further, to, the, east, and, to, the, southeast, the, groups, of, these, peoples, that, ended, up, in, the, finnish, lakeland, from, 1600, to, 1500, bc, later, became, the, s, mi, the, s, mi, people, arrived, in, their, current, homeland, some, time, during, the, bronze, age, or, early, iron, age, the, s, mi, language, first, developed, on, the, southern, side, of, lake, onega, and, lake, ladoga, and, spread, from, there, when, the, speakers, of, this, language, extended, to, the, area, of, modern, day, finland, they, encountered, groups, of, peoples, who, spoke, a, number, of, smaller, ancient, languages, paleo, laplandic, languages, which, later, became, extinct, however, these, languages, left, traces, in, the, s, mi, language, pre, finnic, substrate, as, the, language, spread, further, it, became, segmented, into, dialects, the, geographical, distribution, of, the, s, mi, has, evolved, over, the, course, of, history, from, the, bronze, age, the, s, mi, occupied, the, area, along, the, coast, of, finnmark, and, the, kola, peninsula, this, coincides, with, the, arrival, of, the, siberian, genome, to, estonia, and, finland, which, may, correspond, with, the, introduction, of, the, finno, ugric, languages, in, the, region, petroglyphs, and, archeological, findings, such, as, settlements, dating, from, about, 10, 000, bc, can, be, found, in, lapland, and, finnmark, although, these, have, not, been, demonstrated, to, be, related, to, the, s, mi, people, these, hunter, gatherers, of, the, late, paleolithic, and, early, mesolithic, were, named, komsa, by, the, researchers, the, s, mi, have, a, complex, relationship, with, the, scandinavians, known, as, norse, people, in, the, medieval, era, the, dominant, peoples, of, scandinavia, who, speak, scandinavian, languages, and, who, founded, and, thus, dominated, the, kingdoms, of, norway, and, sweden, the, migration, of, germanic, speaking, peoples, to, southern, scandinavia, happened, independently, and, separate, from, the, s, mi, migrations, into, the, northern, regions, for, centuries, the, s, mi, and, the, scandinavians, had, relatively, little, contact, the, s, mi, primarily, lived, in, the, inland, of, northern, fennoscandia, while, scandinavians, lived, in, southern, scandinavia, and, gradually, colonised, the, norwegian, coast, from, the, 18th, and, especially, the, 19th, century, the, governments, of, norway, and, sweden, started, to, assert, sovereignty, more, aggressively, in, the, north, and, targeted, the, s, mi, with, scandinavization, policies, aimed, at, forced, assimilation, from, the, 19th, century, before, the, era, of, forced, scandinavization, policies, the, norwegian, and, swedish, authorities, had, largely, ignored, the, s, mi, and, did, not, interfere, much, in, their, way, of, life, while, norwegians, moved, north, to, gradually, colonise, the, coast, of, modern, day, troms, and, finnmark, to, engage, in, an, export, driven, fisheries, industry, prior, to, the, 19th, century, they, showed, little, interest, in, the, harsh, and, non, arable, inland, populated, by, reindeer, herding, s, mi, unlike, the, norwegians, on, the, coast, who, were, strongly, dependent, on, their, trade, with, the, south, the, s, mi, in, the, inland, lived, off, the, land, from, the, 19th, century, norwegian, and, swedish, authorities, started, to, regard, the, s, mi, as, a, backward, and, primitive, people, in, need, of, being, civilized, imposing, the, scandinavian, languages, as, the, only, valid, languages, of, the, kingdoms, and, effectively, banning, s, mi, language, and, culture, in, many, contexts, particularly, schools, how, far, south, the, s, mi, extended, in, the, past, has, been, debated, among, historians, and, archeologists, for, many, years, the, norwegian, historian, yngvar, nielsen, commissioned, by, the, norwegian, government, in, 1889, to, determine, this, question, in, order, to, settle, contemporary, questions, of, s, mi, land, rights, concluded, that, the, s, mi, had, lived, no, farther, south, than, lierne, municipality, in, tr, ndelag, county, until, around, 1500, when, they, started, moving, south, reaching, the, area, around, lake, femund, in, the, 18th, century, this, hypothesis, is, still, accepted, among, many, historians, but, has, been, the, subject, of, scholarly, debate, in, the, 21st, century, in, recent, years, several, archaeological, finds, indicate, a, s, mi, presence, in, southern, norway, in, the, middle, ages, and, in, southern, sweden, including, finds, in, lesja, municipality, in, vang, municipality, in, valdres, and, in, hol, municipality, and, l, municipality, in, hallingdal, proponents, of, the, s, mi, interpretations, of, these, finds, assume, a, mixed, population, of, norse, and, s, mi, people, in, the, mountainous, areas, of, southern, norway, in, the, middle, ages, until, the, arrival, of, bubonic, plague, in, northern, norway, in, 1349, the, s, mi, and, the, norwegians, occupied, very, separate, economic, niches, the, s, mi, hunted, reindeer, and, fished, for, their, livelihood, the, norwegians, who, were, concentrated, on, the, outer, islands, and, near, the, mouths, of, the, fjords, had, access, to, the, major, european, trade, routes, so, that, in, addition, to, marginal, farming, in, the, nordland, troms, and, finnmark, counties, they, were, able, to, establish, commerce, trading, fish, for, products, from, the, south, according, to, old, nordic, texts, the, sea, s, mi, and, the, mountain, s, mi, are, two, classes, of, the, same, people, and, not, two, different, ethnic, groups, as, had, been, erroneously, believed, this, socioeconomic, balance, greatly, changed, when, bubonic, plague, came, to, northern, norway, in, december, 1349, the, norwegians, were, closely, connected, to, the, greater, european, trade, routes, along, which, the, plague, traveled, consequently, they, were, infected, and, died, at, a, far, higher, rate, than, s, mi, in, the, interior, of, all, the, states, in, the, region, norway, suffered, the, most, from, this, plague, depending, on, the, parish, 60, to, 76, percent, of, northern, norwegian, farms, were, abandoned, following, the, plague, while, land, rents, another, measure, of, population, dropped, to, 9, 28, of, pre, plague, levels, although, the, population, of, northern, norway, is, sparse, compared, to, southern, europe, the, disease, spread, just, as, fast, the, spread, of, the, plague, carrying, flea, xenopsylla, cheopsis, from, the, south, was, facilitated, by, the, transport, of, wooden, barrels, holding, wheat, rye, or, wool, where, the, fleas, were, able, to, live, and, even, reproduce, for, several, months, at, a, time, the, s, mi, lived, on, fish, and, reindeer, meat, and, did, not, eat, wheat, or, rye, they, lived, in, communities, detached, from, the, norwegians, being, only, loosely, connected, to, the, european, trade, routes, they, fared, far, better, than, the, norwegians, fishing, has, always, been, the, main, livelihood, for, the, many, s, mi, living, permanently, in, coastal, areas, archeological, research, shows, that, the, s, mi, have, lived, along, the, coast, and, once, lived, much, farther, south, in, the, past, and, they, were, also, involved, in, work, other, than, reindeer, herding, e, g, fishing, agriculture, iron, work, the, fishing, along, the, north, norwegian, coast, especially, in, the, lofoten, and, vester, len, islands, is, quite, productive, with, a, variety, of, fish, during, medieval, times, it, was, a, major, source, of, income, for, both, the, fishermen, and, the, norwegian, monarchy, with, such, massive, population, drops, caused, by, the, black, death, the, tax, revenues, from, this, industry, greatly, diminished, because, of, the, huge, profits, that, could, be, had, from, these, fisheries, the, local, authorities, offered, incentives, to, the, s, mi, faced, with, their, own, population, pressures, to, settle, on, the, newly, vacant, farms, this, started, the, economic, division, between, the, sea, s, mi, sj, samene, who, fished, extensively, off, the, coast, and, the, mountain, s, mi, fjellsamene, innlandssamene, who, continued, to, hunt, reindeer, and, small, game, animals, they, later, herded, reindeer, even, as, late, as, the, early, 18th, century, there, were, many, s, mi, who, were, still, settling, on, these, farms, left, abandoned, from, the, 1350s, after, many, years, of, continuous, migration, these, sea, s, mi, became, far, more, numerous, than, the, reindeer, herding, mountain, s, mi, who, today, only, make, up, 10, of, all, s, mi, in, contemporary, times, there, are, also, ongoing, consultations, between, the, government, of, norway, and, the, s, mi, parliament, regarding, the, right, of, the, coastal, s, mi, to, fish, in, the, seas, on, the, basis, of, historical, use, and, international, law, state, regulation, of, sea, fisheries, underwent, drastic, change, in, the, late, 1980s, the, regulation, linked, quotas, to, vessels, and, not, to, fishers, these, newly, calculated, quotas, were, distributed, free, of, charge, to, larger, vessels, on, the, basis, of, the, amount, of, the, catch, in, previous, years, resulting, in, small, vessels, in, s, mi, districts, falling, outside, the, new, quota, system, to, a, large, degree, as, the, sea, s, mi, settled, along, norway, s, fjords, and, inland, waterways, pursuing, a, combination, of, farming, cattle, raising, trapping, and, fishing, the, minority, mountain, s, mi, continued, to, hunt, wild, reindeer, around, 1500, they, started, to, tame, these, animals, into, herding, groups, becoming, the, well, known, reindeer, nomads, often, portrayed, by, outsiders, as, following, the, traditional, s, mi, lifestyle, the, mountain, s, mi, had, to, pay, taxes, to, three, states, norway, sweden, and, russia, as, they, crossed, each, border, while, following, the, annual, reindeer, migrations, this, caused, much, resentment, over, the, years, between, 1635, and, 1659, the, swedish, crown, forced, swedish, conscripts, and, s, mi, cart, drivers, to, work, in, the, nasa, silver, mine, causing, many, s, mis, to, emigrate, from, the, area, to, avoid, forced, labour, as, a, result, the, population, of, pite, and, lule, speaking, s, mi, decreased, greatly, for, long, periods, of, time, the, s, mi, lifestyle, thrived, because, of, its, adaptation, to, the, arctic, environment, indeed, throughout, the, 18th, century, as, norwegians, of, northern, norway, suffered, from, low, fish, prices, and, consequent, depopulation, the, s, mi, cultural, element, was, strengthened, since, the, s, mi, were, mostly, independent, of, supplies, from, southern, norway, during, the, 19th, century, the, pressure, of, christianization, of, the, s, mi, increased, with, some, s, mi, adopting, laestadianism, with, the, introduction, of, seven, compulsory, years, of, school, in, 1889, the, s, mi, language, and, traditional, way, of, life, came, increasingly, under, pressure, from, forced, cultural, normalization, strong, economic, development, of, the, north, also, ensued, giving, norwegian, culture, and, language, higher, status, on, the, swedish, and, finnish, sides, the, authorities, were, less, militant, although, the, s, mi, language, was, forbidden, in, schools, and, strong, economic, development, in, the, north, led, to, weakened, cultural, and, economic, status, for, the, s, mi, from, 1913, to, 1920, the, swedish, race, segregation, political, movement, created, a, race, based, biological, institute, that, collected, research, material, from, living, people, and, graves, throughout, history, swedish, settlers, were, encouraged, to, move, to, the, northern, regions, through, incentives, such, as, land, and, water, rights, tax, allowances, and, military, exemptions, the, strongest, pressure, took, place, from, around, 1900, to, 1940, when, norway, invested, considerable, money, and, effort, to, assimilate, s, mi, culture, anyone, who, wanted, to, buy, or, lease, state, lands, for, agriculture, in, finnmark, had, to, prove, knowledge, of, the, norwegian, language, and, had, to, register, with, a, norwegian, name, this, partly, caused, the, dislocation, of, s, mi, people, in, the, 1920s, which, increased, the, gap, between, local, s, mi, groups, something, still, present, today, that, sometimes, has, the, character, of, an, internal, s, mi, ethnic, conflict, another, example, of, forced, displacement, occurred, between, 1919, and, 1920, in, norway, and, sweden, this, has, been, the, topic, of, a, recent, work, of, journalism, by, s, mi, author, elin, anna, labba, translated, into, english, in, 2023, under, the, title, the, rocks, will, echo, our, sorrow, the, forced, displacement, of, the, northern, s, mi, in, 1913, the, norwegian, parliament, passed, a, bill, on, native, act, land, to, allocate, the, best, and, most, useful, lands, to, norwegian, settlers, another, factor, was, the, scorched, earth, policy, conducted, by, the, german, army, resulting, in, heavy, war, destruction, in, northern, finland, and, northern, norway, in, 1944, 45, destroying, all, existing, houses, or, kota, and, visible, traces, of, s, mi, culture, after, world, war, ii, the, pressure, was, relaxed, though, the, legacy, was, evident, into, recent, times, such, as, the, 1970s, law, limiting, the, size, of, any, house, s, mi, people, were, allowed, to, build, the, controversy, over, the, construction, of, the, hydro, electric, power, station, in, alta, municipality, in, 1979, brought, s, mi, rights, onto, the, political, agenda, in, august, 1986, the, national, anthem, s, mi, soga, l, vlla, and, flag, s, mi, flag, of, the, s, mi, people, were, created, in, 1989, the, first, s, mi, parliament, in, norway, was, elected, in, 2005, the, finnmark, act, was, passed, in, the, norwegian, parliament, giving, the, s, mi, parliament, and, the, finnmark, provincial, council, a, joint, responsibility, of, administering, the, land, areas, previously, considered, state, property, these, areas, 96, of, the, provincial, area, which, have, always,

behaviors, to, identify, lost, s, mi, dances, and, reimagine, them, through, contemporary, dance, an, example, is, the, lihkadus, ecstasy, dance, described, in, sources, from, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, but, which, was, adapted, by, swedish, s, mi, priest, lars, levi, laestadius, who, brought, it, and, other, s, mi, traditions, into, the, church, of, sweden, as, part, of, the, laestadianism, movement, partner, and, group, dancing, have, been, a, part, of, skolt, s, mi, culture, and, among, s, mi, on, the, kola, peninsula, since, at, least, the, second, half, of, the, 1800s, these, square, dances, couple, dances, circle, dances, and, singing, games, are, influenced, by, karelian, and, northern, russian, dance, cultures, likely, under, the, influence, of, russian, traders, military, service, under, the, tsar, and, the, russian, orthodox, church, this, eastern, s, pmi, dance, tradition, has, been, more, continuous, and, has, been, adapted, by, modern, s, mi, dance, companies, such, as, johtti, kompani, reindeer, husbandry, has, been, and, still, is, an, important, aspect, of, s, mi, culture, traditionally, the, s, mi, lived, and, worked, in, reindeer, herding, groups, called, siidat, which, consist, of, several, families, and, their, herds, members, of, the, siida, helped, each, other, with, the, management, and, husbandry, of, the, herds, during, the, years, of, forced, assimilation, the, areas, in, which, reindeer, herding, was, an, important, livelihood, were, among, the, few, where, the, s, mi, culture, and, language, survived, today, in, norway, and, sweden, reindeer, husbandry, is, legally, protected, as, an, exclusive, s, mi, livelihood, such, that, only, persons, of, s, mi, descent, with, a, linkage, to, a, reindeer, herding, family, can, own, and, hence, make, a, living, off, reindeer, presently, about, 2, 800, people, are, engaged, in, reindeer, herding, in, norway, in, finland, reindeer, husbandry, is, not, exclusive, and, is, also, practiced, to, a, limited, degree, by, ethnic, finns, legally, it, is, restricted, to, eu, eea, nationals, resident, in, the, area, in, the, north, lapland, it, plays, a, major, role, in, the, local, economy, while, its, economic, impact, is, lesser, in, the, southern, parts, of, the, area, province, of, oulu, among, the, reindeer, herders, in, s, mi, villages, the, women, usually, have, a, higher, level, of, formal, education, in, the, area, the, s, mi, have, traditionally, played, both, card, games, and, board, games, but, few, s, mi, games, have, survived, because, christian, missionaries, and, laestadianists, considered, such, games, sinful, only, the, rules, of, three, s, mi, board, games, have, been, preserved, into, modern, times, s, hkku, is, a, running, fight, board, game, where, each, player, controls, a, set, of, soldiers, referred, to, as, women, and, men, that, race, across, a, board, in, a, loop, attempting, to, eliminate, the, other, player, s, soldiers, the, game, is, related, to, south, scandinavian, dald, s, arabian, t, b, and, indian, tablan, s, hkku, differs, from, these, games, in, several, respects, most, notably, the, addition, of, a, piece, the, king, that, changes, gameplay, radically, tablut, is, a, pure, strategy, game, in, the, tafl, family, the, game, features, swedes, and, a, swedish, king, whose, goal, is, to, escape, and, an, army, of, muscovites, whose, goal, is, to, capture, the, king, tablut, is, the, only, tafl, game, where, a, relatively, intact, set, of, rules, have, survived, into, our, time, hence, all, modern, versions, of, tafl, commonly, called, hnefatafl, and, marketed, exclusively, as, norse, or, viking, games, are, based, on, the, s, mi, game, of, tablut, dablot, prejjesne, is, a, game, related, to, alquerque, which, differs, from, most, such, games, e, g, draughts, by, having, pieces, of, three, different, ranks, the, game, s, two, sides, are, referred, to, as, s, mi, king, prince, warriors, and, finlenders, landowners, landowner, s, son, farmers, s, pmi, is, located, in, northern, europe, includes, the, northern, parts, of, fennoscandia, and, spans, four, countries, norway, sweden, finland, and, russia, non, s, mi, and, many, regional, maps, have, often, called, this, same, region, lapland, as, there, is, considerable, regional, overlap, between, s, pmi, and, the, provinces, of, lappland, in, sweden, and, lapland, in, finland, much, of, s, pmi, falls, outside, of, those, provinces, despite, the, terms, use, in, tourism, lapland, can, be, either, misleading, or, offensive, or, both, to, s, mi, depending, on, the, context, and, where, this, word, is, used, among, the, s, mi, people, s, pmi, is, strictly, used, and, acceptable, there, is, no, official, geographic, definition, for, the, boundaries, of, s, pmi, however, the, following, counties, and, provinces, are, usually, included, the, municipalities, of, g, llivare, jokkmokk, and, arjeplog, in, swedish, lappland, were, designated, a, unesco, world, heritage, site, in, 1996, as, a, laponian, area, the, s, mi, domicile, area, in, finland, consists, of, the, municipalities, of, enonteki, utsjoki, and, inari, as, well, as, a, part, of, the, municipality, of, sodankyl, about, 3, 000, of, finland, s, about, 10, 000, people, speak, s, mi, as, their, mother, tongue, today, a, considerable, part, of, the, finnish, s, mi, live, outside, the, s, pmi, region, for, example, in, helsinki, there, is, a, relatively, large, and, active, s, mi, minority, according, to, the, s, mi, parliament, the, s, mi, live, in, 230, municipalities, out, of, a, total, of, 336, municipalities, in, finland, 75, of, s, mi, under, the, age, of, 10, live, outside, the, s, pmi, region, the, following, municipalities, have, a, significant, s, mi, population, or, host, s, mi, institutions, norwegian, swedish, finnish, or, russian, name, in, parentheses, in, the, geographical, area, of, s, pmi, the, s, mi, are, a, small, population, according, to, some, the, estimated, total, s, mi, population, is, about, 70, 000, one, problem, when, attempting, to, count, the, population, of, the, s, mi, is, that, there, are, few, common, criteria, of, what, being, a, s, mi, constitutes, in, addition, there, are, several, s, mi, languages, and, additional, dialects, and, there, are, several, areas, in, sapmi, where, few, of, the, s, mi, speak, their, native, language, due, to, the, forced, cultural, assimilation, but, still, consider, themselves, s, mi, other, identity, markers, are, kinship, which, can, be, said, to, at, some, level, or, other, be, of, high, importance, for, all, s, mi, the, geographical, region, of, s, pmi, where, their, family, came, from, and, or, protecting, or, preserving, certain, aspects, of, s, mi, culture, all, the, nordic, s, mi, parliaments, have, included, as, the, core, criterion, for, registering, as, a, s, mi, the, identity, in, itself, one, must, declare, that, one, truly, considers, oneself, a, s, mi, objective, criteria, vary, but, are, generally, related, to, kinship, and, or, language, still, due, to, the, cultural, assimilation, of, the, s, mi, people, that, had, occurred, in, the, four, countries, over, the, centuries, population, estimates, are, difficult, to, measure, precisely, the, population, has, been, estimated, to, be, between, 80, 000, and, 135, 000, across, the, whole, nordic, region, including, urban, areas, such, as, oslo, norway, traditionally, considered, outside, s, pmi, the, norwegian, state, recognizes, any, norwegian, as, s, mi, if, he, or, she, has, one, great, grandparent, whose, home, language, was, s, mi, but, there, is, not, and, has, never, been, any, registration, of, the, home, language, spoken, by, norwegian, people, roughly, half, of, all, s, mi, live, in, norway, but, many, live, in, sweden, with, smaller, groups, living, in, the, far, north, of, finland, and, the, kola, peninsula, of, russia, the, s, mi, in, russia, were, forced, by, the, soviet, authorities, to, relocate, to, a, collective, called, lovozero, luj, vri, in, the, central, part, of, the, kola, peninsula, there, is, no, single, s, mi, language, but, a, group, of, ten, distinct, s, mi, languages, six, of, these, languages, have, their, own, written, standards, the, s, mi, languages, are, relatively, closely, related, but, not, mutually, intelligible, for, instance, speakers, of, southern, s, mi, cannot, understand, northern, s, mi, especially, earlier, these, distinct, languages, were, referred, to, as, dialects, but, today, this, is, considered, misleading, due, to, the, deep, differences, between, the, varieties, most, s, mi, languages, are, spoken, in, several, countries, because, linguistic, borders, do, not, correspond, to, national, borders, all, s, mi, languages, are, at, some, degree, of, endangerment, ranging, from, what, unesco, defines, as, definitely, endangered, to, extinct, this, is, due, in, part, to, historic, laws, prohibiting, the, use, of, s, mi, languages, in, schools, and, at, home, in, sweden, and, norway, s, mi, languages, and, s, mi, song, chants, called, joiks, were, illegal, in, norway, from, 1773, until, 1958, then, access, to, s, mi, instruction, as, part, of, schooling, was, not, available, until, 1988, special, residential, schools, that, would, assimilate, the, s, mi, into, the, dominant, culture, were, established, these, were, originally, run, by, missionaries, but, later, controlled, by, the, government, for, example, in, russia, s, mi, children, were, taken, away, when, aged, 1, 2, and, returned, when, aged, 15, 17, with, no, knowledge, of, their, language, and, traditional, communities, not, all, s, mi, viewed, the, schools, negatively, and, not, all, of, the, schools, were, brutal, however, being, taken, from, home, and, prohibited, from, speaking, s, mi, has, resulted, in, cultural, alienation, loss, of, language, and, lowered, self, esteem, the, s, mi, languages, belong, to, the, uralic, language, family, linguistically, related, to, finnish, estonian, and, hungarian, due, to, prolonged, contact, and, import, of, items, foreign, to, s, mi, culture, from, neighboring, scandinavians, there, are, a, number, of, germanic, loanwords, in, s, mi, particularly, for, urban, objects, the, majority, of, the, s, mi, now, speak, the, majority, languages, of, the, countries, they, live, in, i, e, swedish, russian, finnish, and, norwegian, efforts, are, being, made, to, further, the, use, of, s, mi, languages, among, s, mi, and, persons, of, s, mi, origin, despite, these, changes, the, legacy, of, cultural, repression, still, exists, many, older, s, mi, still, refuse, to, speak, s, mi, in, addition, s, mi, parents, still, feel, alienated, from, schools, and, hence, do, not, participate, as, much, as, they, could, in, shaping, school, curricula, and, policy, in, norway, the, name, of, the, language, is, samisk, and, the, name, of, the, people, is, same, in, finland, the, name, of, the, language, is, spelled, saame, and, the, name, of, the, people, saamelainen, american, scientist, michael, e, krauss, published, in, 1997, an, estimate, of, s, mi, population, and, their, languages, kemi, s, mi, language, became, extinct, in, the, 19th, century, many, s, mi, do, not, speak, any, of, the, s, mi, languages, any, more, due, to, historical, assimilation, policies, so, the, number, of, s, mi, living, in, each, area, is, much, higher, s, pmi, is, traditionally, divided, into, it, should, also, be, noted, that, many, s, mi, now, live, outside, s, pmi, in, large, cities, such, as, oslo, in, norway, a, division, often, used, in, northern, s, mi, is, based, on, occupation, and, the, area, of, living, this, division, is, also, used, in, many, historical, texts, according, to, the, norwegian, s, mi, parliament, the, s, mi, population, of, norway, is, 40, 000, if, all, people, who, speak, s, mi, or, have, a, parent, grandparent, or, great, grandparent, who, speaks, or, spoke, s, mi, are, included, the, number, reaches, 70, 000, as, of, 2021, 20, 545, people, were, registered, to, vote, in, the, election, for, the, s, mi, parliament, in, norway, the, bulk, of, the, s, mi, live, in, finnmark, and, northern, troms, but, there, are, also, s, mi, populations, in, southern, troms, nordland, and, tr, ndelag, due, to, recent, migration, it, has, also, been, claimed, that, oslo, is, the, municipality, with, the, largest, s, mi, population, the, s, mi, are, in, a, majority, only, in, guovdageaidnu, municipality, k, r, johka, municipality, pors, gu, municipality, deatnu, municipality, and, unj, rga, municipality, in, finnmark, and, g, ivuotna, municipality, in, northern, troms, this, area, is, also, known, as,

population, of, sweden, ranges, from, 20, 000, to, 40, 000, as, of, 2021, 9, 226, people, were, registered, to, vote, in, elections, to, the, swedish, s, mi, parliament, according, to, the, finnish,

including, saskatchewan, manitoba, and, northern, ontario, and, the, canadian, territories, of, the, northwest, territories, yukon, and, nunavut, descendants, of, these, s, mi, immigrants, typically, know, little, of, their, heritage, because, their, ancestors, purposely, hid, their, indigenous, culture, to, avoid, discrimination, from, the, dominating, scandinavian, or, nordic, culture, some, of, these, s, mi, are, part, of, a, diaspora, that, moved, to, north, america, in, order, to, escape, assimilation, policies, in, their, home, countries, there, were, also, several, s, mi, families, that,
