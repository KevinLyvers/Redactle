human, migration, is, the, movement, of, people, from, one, place, to, another, with, intentions, of, settling, permanently, or, temporarily, at, a, new, location, geographic, region, the, movement, often, occurs, over, long, distances, and, from, one, country, to, another, external, migration, but, internal, migration, within, a, single, country, is, the, dominant, form, of, human, migration, globally, migration, is, often, associated, with, better, human, capital, at, both, individual, and, household, level, and, with, better, access, to, migration, networks, facilitating, a, possible, second, move, it, has, a, high, potential, to, improve, human, development, and, some, studies, confirm, that, migration, is, the, most, direct, route, out, of, poverty, age, is, also, important, for, both, work, and, non, work, migration, people, may, migrate, as, individuals, in, family, units, or, in, large, groups, there, are, four, major, forms, of, migration, invasion, conquest, colonization, and, emigration, immigration, people, moving, from, their, home, due, to, forced, displacement, such, as, a, natural, disaster, or, civil, disturbance, may, be, described, as, displaced, persons, or, if, remaining, in, the, home, country, internally, displaced, persons, people, who, flee, to, a, different, country, due, to, political, religious, or, other, types, of, persecution, in, their, home, country, can, formally, request, shelter, in, the, host, country, these, people, are, commonly, referred, to, as, an, asylum, seekers, if, the, application, is, approved, their, legal, classification, changes, to, that, of, refugees, depending, on, the, goal, and, reason, for, relocation, migrants, can, be, divided, into, three, categories, migrants, refugees, and, asylum, seekers, each, category, is, defined, broadly, as, the, combination, of, circumstances, that, motivate, a, person, to, change, their, location, as, such, migrants, are, traditionally, described, as, persons, who, change, the, country, of, residence, for, general, reasons, these, purposes, may, include, better, job, opportunities, or, healthcare, needs, this, term, is, the, most, widely, understood, as, anyone, changing, their, geographical, location, permanently, is, a, migrant, in, contrast, refugees, are, defined, and, described, as, persons, who, do, not, willingly, relocate, the, reasons, for, the, refugees, migration, usually, involve, war, actions, within, the, country, or, other, forms, of, oppression, coming, either, from, the, government, or, non, governmental, sources, refugees, are, usually, associated, with, people, who, must, unwillingly, relocate, as, fast, as, possible, hence, such, migrants, will, likely, relocate, undocumented, asylum, seekers, are, associated, with, persons, who, also, leave, their, country, unwillingly, yet, who, also, do, not, do, so, under, oppressing, circumstances, such, as, war, or, death, threats, the, motivation, to, leave, the, country, for, asylum, seekers, might, involve, an, unstable, economic, or, political, situation, or, high, rates, of, crime, thus, asylum, seekers, relocate, predominantly, to, escape, the, degradation, of, the, quality, of, their, lives, nomadic, movements, usually, are, not, regarded, as, migrations, as, the, movement, is, generally, seasonal, there, is, no, intention, to, settle, in, the, new, place, and, only, a, few, people, have, retained, this, form, of, lifestyle, in, modern, times, temporary, movement, for, travel, tourism, pilgrimages, or, the, commute, is, also, not, regarded, as, migration, in, the, absence, of, an, intention, to, live, and, settle, in, the, visited, places, there, exist, many, statistical, estimates, of, worldwide, migration, patterns, the, world, bank, has, published, three, editions, of, its, migration, and, remittances, factbook, beginning, in, 2008, with, a, second, edition, appearing, in, 2011, and, a, third, in, 2016, the, international, organisation, for, migration, iom, has, published, ten, editions, of, the, world, migration, report, since, 1999, the, united, nations, statistics, division, also, keeps, a, database, on, worldwide, migration, recent, advances, in, research, on, migration, via, the, internet, promise, better, understanding, of, migration, patterns, and, migration, motives, structurally, there, is, substantial, south, south, and, north, north, migration, in, 2013, 38, of, all, migrants, had, migrated, from, developing, countries, to, other, developing, countries, while, 23, had, migrated, from, high, income, oecd, countries, to, other, high, income, countries, the, united, nations, population, fund, says, that, while, the, north, has, experienced, a, higher, absolute, increase, in, the, migrant, stock, since, 2000, 32, million, compared, to, the, south, 25, million, the, south, recorded, a, higher, growth, rate, between, 2000, and, 2013, the, average, annual, rate, of, change, of, the, migrant, population, in, developing, regions, 2, 3, slightly, exceeded, that, of, the, developed, regions, 2, 1, substantial, internal, migration, can, also, take, place, within, a, country, either, seasonal, human, migration, mainly, related, to, agriculture, and, tourism, to, urban, places, or, shifts, of, the, population, into, cities, urbanisation, or, out, of, cities, suburbanisation, however, studies, of, worldwide, migration, patterns, tend, to, limit, their, scope, to, international, migration, of, the, world, s, population, almost, half, of, these, migrants, are, women, one, of, the, most, significant, migrant, pattern, changes, in, the, last, half, century, women, migrate, alone, or, with, their, family, members, and, community, even, though, female, migration, is, largely, viewed, as, an, association, rather, than, independent, migration, emerging, studies, argue, complex, and, manifold, reasons, for, this, as, of, 2019, the, top, ten, immigration, destinations, were, in, the, same, year, the, top, countries, of, origin, were, besides, these, rankings, according, to, absolute, numbers, of, migrants, the, migration, and, remittances, factbook, also, gives, statistics, for, top, immigration, destination, countries, and, top, emigration, origin, countries, according, to, percentage, of, the, population, the, countries, that, appear, at, the, top, of, those, rankings, are, entirely, different, from, the, ones, in, the, above, rankings, and, tend, to, be, much, smaller, countries, 2, 4, as, of, 2013, the, top, 15, migration, corridors, accounting, for, at, least, two, million, migrants, each, were, 5, the, impacts, of, human, migration, on, the, world, economy, have, been, largely, positive, in, 2015, migrants, who, constituted, 3, 3, of, the, world, population, contributed, 9, 4, of, global, gdp, at, a, microeconomic, level, the, value, of, a, human, mobility, is, largely, recognized, by, firms, a, 2021, survey, by, the, boston, consulting, group, found, that, 72, of, 850, executives, across, several, countries, and, industries, believed, that, migration, benefited, their, countries, and, 45, considered, globally, diverse, employees, a, strategic, advantage, according, to, the, centre, for, global, development, opening, all, borders, could, add, 78, trillion, to, the, world, gdp, remittances, funds, transferred, by, migrant, workers, to, their, home, country, form, a, substantial, part, of, the, economy, of, some, countries, the, top, ten, remittance, recipients, in, 2018, in, addition, to, economic, impacts, migrants, also, make, substantial, contributions, in, sociocultural, and, civic, political, life, sociocultural, contributions, occur, in, the, following, areas, of, societies, food, cuisine, sport, music, art, culture, ideas, and, beliefs, civic, political, contributions, relate, to, participation, in, civic, duties, in, the, context, of, accepted, authority, of, the, state, it, is, in, recognition, of, the, importance, of, these, remittances, that, the, united, nations, sustainable, development, goal, 10, targets, to, substantially, reduce, the, transaction, costs, of, migrants, remittances, to, less, than, 3, by, 2030, migration, is, usually, divided, into, voluntary, migration, and, forced, migration, the, distinction, between, involuntary, fleeing, political, conflict, or, natural, disaster, and, voluntary, migration, economic, or, labour, migration, is, difficult, to, make, and, partially, subjective, as, the, motivators, for, migration, are, often, correlated, the, world, bank, estimated, that, as, of, 2010, 16, 3, million, or, 7, 6, of, migrants, qualified, as, refugees, this, number, grew, to, 19, 5, million, by, 2014, comprising, approximately, 7, 9, of, the, total, number, of, migrants, based, on, the, figure, recorded, in, 2013, at, levels, of, roughly, 3, percent, the, share, of, migrants, among, the, world, population, has, remained, remarkably, constant, over, the, last, 5, decades, voluntary, migration, is, based, on, the, initiative, and, the, free, will, of, the, person, and, is, influenced, by, a, combination, of, factors, economic, political, and, social, either, in, the, migrants, country, of, origin, determinant, factors, or, push, factors, or, in, the, country, of, destination, attraction, factors, or, pull, factors, push, pull, factors, are, the, reasons, that, push, or, attract, people, to, a, particular, place, push, factors, are, the, negative, aspects, for, example, wars, of, the, country, of, origin, often, decisive, in, people, s, choice, to, emigrate, the, pull, factors, are, the, positive, aspects, of, a, different, country, that, encourages, people, to, emigrate, to, seek, a, better, life, for, example, the, government, of, armenia, periodically, gives, incentives, to, people, who, will, migrate, to, live, in, villages, close, to, the, border, with, azerbaijan, this, is, an, implementation, of, a, push, strategy, and, the, reason, people, do, not, want, to, live, near, the, border, is, security, concerns, given, tensions, and, hostility, because, of, azerbaijan, although, the, push, pull, factors, are, opposed, both, are, sides, of, the, same, coin, being, equally, important, although, specific, to, forced, migration, any, other, harmful, factor, can, be, considered, a, push, factor, or, determinant, trigger, factor, such, examples, being, poor, quality, of, life, lack, of, jobs, excessive, pollution, hunger, drought, or, natural, disasters, such, conditions, represent, decisive, reasons, for, voluntary, migration, the, population, preferring, to, migrate, in, order, to, prevent, financially, unfavorable, situations, or, even, emotional, and, physical, suffering, there, are, contested, definitions, of, forced, migration, however, the, editors, of, a, leading, scientific, journal, on, the, subject, the, forced, migration, review, offer, the, following, definition, forced, migration, refers, to, the, movements, of, refugees, and, internally, displaced, people, displaced, by, conflict, as, well, as, people, displaced, by, natural, or, environmental, disasters, chemical, or, nuclear, disasters, famine, or, development, projects, these, different, causes, of, migration, leave, people, with, one, choice, to, move, to, a, new, environment, immigrants, leave, their, beloved, homes, to, seek, a, life, in, camps, spontaneous, settlement, and, countries, of, asylum, by, the, end, of, 2018, there, were, an, estimated, 67, 2, million, forced, migrants, globally, 25, 9, million, refugees, displaced, from, their, countries, and, 41, 3, million, internally, displaced, persons, that, had, been, displaced, within, their, countries, for, different, reasons, in, 2022, 6, million, ukrainian, people, fled, their, country, meanwhile, 3, million, syrian, people, fled, in, 3, years, transit, migration, is, a, highly, debated, term, with, no, official, definition, the, common, understanding, is, that, it, describes, immigrants, who, are, in, the, process, of, moving, to, an, end, goal, country, the, term, was, first, coined, by, the, un, in, 1990, to, describe, immigrants, who, were, traveling, through, countries, surrounding, europe, to, end, up, in, a, european, union, state, another, example, of, transit, migrants, is, central, americans, who, travel, through, mexico, in, order, to, live, in, the, united, states, the, term, transit, migration, has, generated, a, lot, of, debate, among, migration, scholars, and, immigration, institutions, some, criticize, it, as, a, eurocentric, term, that, was, coined, to, place, responsibility, of, migrants, on, states, outside, the, european, union, and, also, to, pressure, those, states, to, prevent, migration, onward, to, the, european, union, scholars, note, that, eu, countries, also, have, identical, migrant, flows, and, therefore, it, is, not, clear, illogical, or, biased, why, it, is, only, migrants, in, non, eu, countries, that, are, labeled, as, transit, migrants, it, is, also, argued, that, the, term, transit, glosses, over, the, complexity, and, difficulty, of, migrant, journeys, migrants, face, many, types, of, violence, while, in, transit, migrants, often, have, no, set, end, destination, and, must, adjust, their, plan, as, they, move, migrant, journeys, can, take, years, and, go, through, several, stages, numerous, causes, impel, migrants, to, move, to, another, country, for, instance, globalization, has, increased, the, demand, for, workers, in, order, to, sustain, national, economies, thus, one, category, of, economic, migrants, generally, from, impoverished, developing, countries, migrates, to, obtain, sufficient, income, for, survival, such, migrants, often, send, some, of, their, income, homes, to, family, members, in, the, form, of, economic, remittances, which, have, become, an, economic, staple, in, a, number, of, developing, countries, people, may, also, move, or, are, forced, to, move, as, a, result, of, conflict, of, human, rights, violations, of, violence, or, to, escape, persecution, in, 2014, the, un, refugee, agency, estimated, that, around, 59, 5, million, people, fell, into, this, category, other, reasons, people, may, move, include, to, gain, access, to, opportunities, and, services, or, to, escape, extreme, weather, this, type, of, movement, usually, from, rural, to, urban, areas, may, be, classed, as, internal, migration, sociology, cultural, and, ego, historical, factors, also, play, a, major, role, in, north, africa, for, example, emigrating, to, europe, counts, as, a, sign, of, social, prestige, moreover, many, countries, were, former, colonies, this, means, that, many, have, relatives, who, live, legally, in, the, former, colonial, metro, pole, and, who, often, provide, important, help, for, immigrants, arriving, in, that, metropole, relatives, may, help, with, job, research, and, with, accommodation, the, geographical, proximity, of, africa, to, europe, and, the, long, historical, ties, between, northern, and, southern, mediterranean, countries, also, prompt, many, to, migrate, whether, a, person, decides, to, move, to, another, country, depends, on, the, relative, skill, premier, of, the, source, and, host, countries, one, is, speaking, of, positive, selection, when, the, host, country, shows, a, higher, skill, premium, than, the, source, country, on, the, other, hand, negative, selection, occurs, when, the, source, country, displays, a, lower, skill, premium, the, relative, skill, premia, define, migrants, selectivity, age, heaping, techniques, display, one, method, to, measure, the, relative, skill, premium, of, a, country, a, number, of, theories, attempt, to, explain, the, international, flow, of, capital, and, people, from, one, country, to, another, recent, academic, output, on, migration, comprises, mainly, journal, articles, the, long, term, trend, shows, a, gradual, increase, in, academic, publishing, on, migration, which, is, likely, to, be, related, to, the, general, expansion, of, academic, literature, production, and, the, increased, prominence, of, migration, research, migration, and, its, research, have, further, changed, with, the, revolution, in, information, and, communication, technologies, this, migration, theory, states, that, the, main, reason, for, labour, migration, is, wage, difference, between, two, geographic, locations, these, wage, differences, are, usually, linked, to, geographic, labour, demand, and, supply, it, can, be, said, that, areas, with, a, shortage, of, labour, but, an, excess, of, capital, have, a, high, relative, wage, while, areas, with, a, high, labour, supply, and, a, dearth, of, capital, have, a, low, relative, wage, labour, tends, to, flow, from, low, wage, areas, to, high, wage, areas, often, with, this, flow, of, labour, comes, changes, in, the, sending, and, the, receiving, country, neoclassical, economic, theory, best, describes, transnational, migration, because, it, is, not, confined, by, international, immigration, laws, and, similar, governmental, regulations, dual, labour, market, theory, states, that, pull, factors, in, more, developed, countries, mainly, cause, migration, this, theory, assumes, that, the, labour, markets, in, these, developed, countries, consist, of, two, segments, the, primary, market, which, requires, high, skilled, labour, and, the, secondary, market, which, is, very, labour, intensive, requiring, low, skilled, workers, this, theory, assumes, that, migration, from, less, developed, countries, into, more, developed, countries, results, from, a, pull, created, by, a, need, for, labour, in, the, developed, countries, in, their, secondary, market, migrant, workers, are, needed, to, fill, the, lowest, rung, of, the, labour, market, because, the, native, labourers, do, not, want, to, do, these, jobs, as, they, present, a, lack, of, mobility, this, creates, a, need, for, migrant, workers, furthermore, the, initial, dearth, in, available, labour, pushes, wages, up, making, migration, even, more, enticing, this, theory, states, that, migration, flows, and, patterns, cannot, be, explained, solely, at, the, level, of, individual, workers, and, their, economic, incentives, but, that, wider, social, entities, must, also, be, considered, one, such, social, entity, is, the, household, migration, can, be, viewed, as, a, result, of, risk, aversion, from, a, household, that, has, insufficient, income, in, this, case, the, household, needs, extra, capital, that, can, be, achieved, through, remittances, sent, back, by, family, members, who, participate, in, migrant, labour, abroad, these, remittances, can, also, have, a, broader, effect, on, the, economy, of, the, sending, country, as, a, whole, as, they, bring, in, capital, recent, research, has, examined, a, decline, in, us, interstate, migration, from, 1991, to, 2011, theorising, that, the, reduced, interstate, migration, is, due, to, a, decline, in, the, geographic, specificity, of, occupations, and, an, increase, in, workers, ability, to, learn, about, other, locations, before, moving, there, through, both, information, technology, and, inexpensive, travel, other, researchers, find, that, the, location, specific, nature, of, housing, is, more, important, than, moving, costs, in, determining, labour, reallocation, relative, deprivation, theory, states, that, awareness, of, the, income, difference, between, neighbours, or, other, households, in, the, migrant, sending, community, is, essential, in, migration, the, incentive, to, migrate, is, a, lot, higher, in, areas, with, a, high, level, of, economic, inequality, in, the, short, run, remittances, may, increase, inequality, but, in, the, long, run, they, may, decrease, it, there, are, two, stages, of, migration, for, workers, first, they, invest, in, human, capital, formation, and, then, they, try, to, capitalise, on, their, investments, in, this, way, successful, migrants, may, use, their, new, capital, to, provide, better, schooling, for, their, children, and, better, homes, for, their, families, successful, high, skilled, emigrants, may, serve, as, an, example, for, neighbours, and, potential, migrants, who, hope, to, achieve, that, level, of, success, world, systems, theory, looks, at, migration, from, a, global, perspective, it, explains, that, interaction, between, different, societies, can, be, an, important, factor, in, social, change, trade, with, one, country, which, causes, an, economic, decline, in, another, may, create, incentive, to, migrate, to, a, country, with, a, more, vibrant, economy, it, can, be, argued, that, even, after, decolonisation, the, economic, dependence, of, former, colonies, remains, on, mother, countries, however, this, view, of, international, trade, is, controversial, and, some, argue, that, free, trade, can, reduce, migration, between, developing, and, developed, countries, it, can, be, argued, that, the, developed, countries, import, labour, intensive, goods, which, causes, an, increase, in, the, employment, of, unskilled, workers, in, the, less, developed, countries, decreasing, the, outflow, of, migrant, workers, exporting, capital, intensive, goods, from, rich, countries, to, developing, countries, also, equalises, income, and, employment, conditions, thus, slowing, migration, in, either, direction, this, theory, can, be, used, to, explain, migration, between, countries, that, are, geographically, far, apart, based, on, the, history, of, human, migration, osmosis, theory, studies, the, evolution, of, its, natural, determinants, in, this, theory, migration, is, divided, into, two, main, types, simple, and, complicated, the, simple, migration, is, divided, in, its, turn, into, diffusion, stabilisation, and, concentration, periods, during, these, periods, water, availability, adequate, climate, security, and, population, density, represent, the, natural, determinants, of, human, migration, the, complicated, migration, is, characterised, by, the, speedy, evolution, and, the, emergence, of, new, sub, determinants, notably, earning, unemployment, networks, and, migration, policies, osmosis, theory, explains, analogically, human, migration, by, the, biophysical, phenomenon, of, osmosis, in, this, respect, the, countries, are, represented, by, animal, cells, the, borders, by, the, semipermeable, membranes, and, the, humans, by, ions, of, water, according, to, the, theory, according, to, the, osmosis, phenomenon, humans, migrate, from, countries, with, less, migration, pressure, to, countries, with, high, migration, pressure, to, measure, the, latter, the, natural, determinants, of, human, migration, replace, the, variables, of, the, second, principle, of, thermodynamics, used, to, measure, the, osmotic, pressure, a, number, of, social, scientists, have, examined, immigration, from, a, sociological, perspective, paying, particular, attention, to, how, immigration, affects, and, is, affected, by, matters, of, race, and, ethnicity, as, well, as, social, structure, they, have, produced, three, main, sociological, perspectives, in, the, 21st, century, as, attention, has, shifted, away, from, countries, of, destination, sociologists, have, attempted, to, understand, how, transnationalism, allows, us, to, understand, the, interplay, between, migrants, their, countries, of, destination, and, their, countries, of, origins, in, this, framework, work, on, social, remittances, by, peggy, levitt, and, others, has, led, to, a, stronger, conceptualisation, of, how, migrants, affect, socio, political, processes, in, their, countries, of, origin, much, work, also, takes, place, in, the, field, of, integration, of, migrants, into, destination, societies, political, scientists, have, put, forth, a, number, of, theoretical, frameworks, relating, to, migration, offering, different, perspectives, on, processes, of, security, citizenship, and, international, relations, the, political, importance, of, diasporas, has, also, become, in, the, 21st, century, a, growing, field, of, interest, as, scholars, examine, questions, of, diaspora, activism, state, diaspora, relations, out, of, country, voting, processes, and, states, soft, power, strategies, in, this, field, the, majority, of, work, has, focused, on, immigration, politics, viewing, migration, from, the, perspective, of, the, country, of, destination, with, regard, to, emigration, processes, political, scientists, have, expanded, on, albert, hirschman, s, framework, on, voice, vs, exit, to, discuss, how, emigration, affects, the, politics, within, countries, of, origin, certain, laws, of, social, science, have, been, proposed, to, describe, human, migration, the, following, was, a, standard, list, after, ernst, georg, ravenstein, s, proposal, in, the, 1880s, demographer, everett, s, lee, s, model, divides, factors, causing, migrations, into, two, groups, of, factors, push, and, pull, push, factors, are, things, that, are, unfavourable, about, the, home, area, that, one, lives, in, and, pull, factors, are, things, that, attract, one, to, another, host, area, push, factors, pull, factors, the, modern, field, of, climate, history, suggests, that, the, successive, waves, of, eurasian, nomadic, movement, throughout, history, have, had, their, origins, in, climatic, cycles, which, have, expanded, or, contracted, pastureland, in, central, asia, especially, mongolia, and, to, its, west, the, altai, mountains, people, were, displaced, from, their, home, ground, by, other, tribes, trying, to, find, land, that, essential, flocks, could, graze, each, group, pushing, the, next, further, to, the, south, and, west, into, the, highlands, of, anatolia, the, pannonian, plain, into, mesopotamia, or, southwards, into, the, rich, pastures, of, china, bogumil, terminski, uses, the, term, migratory, domino, effect, to, describe, this, process, in, the, context, of, sea, people, invasion, the, theory, is, that, migration, occurs, because, individuals, search, for, food, sex, and, security, outside, their, usual, habitation, idyorough, 2008, believes, that, towns, and, cities, are, a, creation, of, the, human, struggle, to, obtain, food, sex, and, security, to, produce, food, security, and, reproduction, human, beings, must, out, of, necessity, move, out, of, their, usual, habitation, and, enter, into, indispensable, social, relationships, that, are, cooperative, or, antagonistic, human, beings, also, develop, the, tools, and, equipment, to, interact, with, nature, to, produce, the, desired, food, and, security, the, improved, relationship, cooperative, relationships, among, human, beings, and, improved, technology, further, conditioned, by, the, push, and, pull, factors, all, interact, together, to, cause, or, bring, about, migration, and, higher, concentration, of, individuals, into, towns, and, cities, the, higher, the, technology, of, production, of, food, and, security, and, the, higher, the, cooperative, relationship, among, human, beings, in, the, production, of, food, and, security, and, the, reproduction, of, the, human, species, the, higher, would, be, the, push, and, pull, factors, in, the, migration, and, concentration, of, human, beings, in, towns, and, cities, countryside, towns, and, cities, do, not, just, exist, but, they, do, so, to, meet, the, basic, human, needs, of, food, security, and, the, reproduction, of, the, human, species, therefore, migration, occurs, because, individuals, search, for, food, sex, and, security, outside, their, usual, habitation, social, services, in, the, towns, and, cities, are, provided, to, meet, these, basic, needs, for, human, survival, and, pleasure, by, their, very, nature, international, migration, and, displacement, are,
