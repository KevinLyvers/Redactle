nationalism, is, an, idea, or, movement, that, holds, that, the, nation, should, be, congruent, with, the, state, as, a, movement, it, presupposes, the, existence, and, tends, to, promote, the, interests, of, a, particular, nation, especially, with, the, aim, of, gaining, and, maintaining, its, sovereignty, self, governance, over, its, perceived, homeland, to, create, a, nation, state, it, holds, that, each, nation, should, govern, itself, free, from, outside, interference, self, determination, that, a, nation, is, a, natural, and, ideal, basis, for, a, polity, and, that, the, nation, is, the, only, rightful, source, of, political, power, it, further, aims, to, build, and, maintain, a, single, national, identity, based, on, a, combination, of, shared, social, characteristics, such, as, culture, ethnicity, geographic, location, language, politics, or, the, government, religion, traditions, and, belief, in, a, shared, singular, history, and, to, promote, national, unity, or, solidarity, there, are, various, definitions, of, a, nation, which, leads, to, different, types, of, nationalism, the, two, main, divergent, forms, are, ethnic, nationalism, and, civic, nationalism, beginning, in, the, late, 18th, century, particularly, with, the, french, revolution, and, the, spread, of, the, principle, of, popular, sovereignty, or, self, determination, the, idea, that, the, people, should, rule, is, developed, by, political, theorists, three, main, theories, have, been, used, to, explain, the, emergence, of, nationalism, the, moral, value, of, nationalism, the, relationship, between, nationalism, and, patriotism, and, the, compatibility, of, nationalism, and, cosmopolitanism, are, all, subjects, of, philosophical, debate, nationalism, can, be, combined, with, diverse, political, goals, and, ideologies, such, as, conservatism, national, conservatism, and, right, wing, populism, or, socialism, left, wing, nationalism, in, practice, nationalism, is, seen, as, positive, or, negative, depending, on, its, ideology, and, outcomes, nationalism, has, been, a, feature, of, movements, for, freedom, and, justice, has, been, associated, with, cultural, revivals, and, encourages, pride, in, national, achievements, it, has, also, been, used, to, legitimize, racial, ethnic, and, religious, divisions, suppress, or, attack, minorities, undermine, human, rights, and, democratic, traditions, and, start, wars, being, frequently, cited, as, a, cause, of, both, world, wars, the, terminological, use, of, nations, sovereignty, and, associated, concepts, were, significantly, refined, with, the, writing, by, hugo, grotius, of, de, jure, belli, ac, pacis, in, the, early, 17th, century, living, in, the, times, of, the, eighty, years, war, between, spain, and, the, netherlands, and, the, thirty, years, war, between, catholic, and, protestant, european, nations, grotius, was, deeply, concerned, with, matters, of, conflicts, between, nations, in, the, context, of, oppositions, stemming, from, religious, differences, the, word, nation, was, also, applied, before, 1800, in, europe, in, reference, to, the, inhabitants, of, a, country, as, well, as, to, collective, identities, that, could, include, shared, history, law, language, political, rights, religion, and, traditions, in, a, sense, more, akin, to, the, modern, conception, nationalism, as, derived, from, the, noun, designating, nations, is, a, newer, word, in, the, english, language, dating, to, around, 1798, the, term, gained, wider, prominence, in, the, 19th, century, the, term, increasingly, became, negative, in, its, connotations, after, 1914, glenda, sluga, notes, that, the, twentieth, century, a, time, of, profound, disillusionment, with, nationalism, was, also, the, great, age, of, globalism, academics, define, nationalism, as, a, political, principle, that, holds, that, the, nation, and, state, should, be, congruent, according, to, lisa, weeden, nationalist, ideology, presumes, that, the, people, and, the, state, are, congruent, anthony, d, smith, describes, how, intellectuals, played, a, primary, role, in, generating, cultural, perceptions, of, nationalism, and, providing, the, ideology, of, political, nationalism, wherever, one, turns, in, europe, their, seminal, position, in, generating, and, analysing, the, concepts, myths, symbols, and, ideology, of, nationalism, is, apparent, this, applies, to, the, first, appearance, of, the, core, doctrine, and, to, the, antecedent, concepts, of, national, character, genius, of, the, nation, and, national, will, smith, posits, the, challenges, posed, to, traditional, religion, and, society, in, the, age, of, revolution, propelled, many, intellectuals, to, discover, alternative, principles, and, concepts, and, a, new, mythology, and, symbolism, to, legitimate, and, ground, human, thought, and, action, he, discusses, the, simultaneous, concept, of, historicism, to, describe, an, emerging, belief, in, the, birth, growth, and, decay, of, specific, peoples, and, cultures, which, became, increasingly, attractive, as, a, framework, for, inquiry, into, the, past, and, present, and, an, explanatory, principle, in, elucidating, the, meaning, of, events, past, and, present, the, prussian, scholar, johann, gottfried, herder, 1744, 1803, originated, the, term, in, 1772, in, his, treatise, on, the, origin, of, language, stressing, the, role, of, a, common, language, he, attached, exceptional, importance, to, the, concepts, of, nationality, and, of, patriotism, he, that, has, lost, his, patriotic, spirit, has, lost, himself, and, the, whole, world, about, himself, whilst, teaching, that, in, a, certain, sense, every, human, perfection, is, national, erica, benner, identifies, herder, as, the, first, philosopher, to, explicitly, suggest, that, identities, based, on, language, should, be, regarded, as, the, primary, source, of, legitimate, political, authority, or, locus, of, political, resistance, herder, also, encouraged, the, creation, of, a, common, cultural, and, language, policy, amongst, the, separate, german, states, scholars, frequently, place, the, beginning, of, nationalism, in, the, late, 18th, century, or, early, 19th, century, with, the, american, declaration, of, independence, or, with, the, french, revolution, though, there, is, ongoing, debate, about, its, existence, in, varying, forms, during, the, middle, ages, and, even, antiquity, tom, garvin, wrote, that, something, strangely, like, modern, nationalism, is, documented, for, many, peoples, in, medieval, times, and, in, classical, times, as, well, citing, the, ancient, jews, the, classical, greeks, and, the, gaulish, and, british, celts, as, examples, the, great, jewish, revolt, against, roman, rule, 66, 73, ce, is, often, cited, by, scholars, as, a, prominent, example, of, ancient, jewish, nationalism, anthony, d, smith, wrote, that, the, jews, of, the, late, second, temple, period, provide, a, closer, approximation, to, the, ideal, type, of, the, nation, than, perhaps, anywhere, else, in, the, ancient, world, adding, that, this, observation, must, make, us, wary, of, pronouncing, too, readily, against, the, possibility, of, the, nation, and, even, a, form, of, religious, nationalism, before, the, onset, of, modernity, the, consensus, is, that, nationalism, as, a, concept, was, firmly, established, by, the, 19th, century, in, histories, of, nationalism, the, french, revolution, 1789, is, seen, as, an, important, starting, point, not, only, for, its, impact, on, french, nationalism, but, even, more, for, its, impact, on, germans, and, italians, and, on, european, intellectuals, the, template, of, nationalism, as, a, method, for, mobilizing, public, opinion, around, a, new, state, based, on, popular, sovereignty, went, back, further, than, 1789, philosophers, such, as, rousseau, and, voltaire, whose, ideas, influenced, the, french, revolution, had, themselves, been, influenced, or, encouraged, by, the, example, of, earlier, constitutionalist, liberation, movements, notably, the, corsican, republic, 1755, 1768, and, american, revolution, 1775, 1783, due, to, the, industrial, revolution, there, was, an, emergence, of, an, integrated, nation, encompassing, economy, and, a, national, public, sphere, where, british, people, began, to, mobilize, on, a, state, wide, scale, rather, than, just, in, the, smaller, units, of, their, province, town, or, family, the, early, emergence, of, a, popular, patriotic, nationalism, took, place, in, the, mid, 18th, century, and, was, actively, promoted, by, the, british, government, and, by, the, writers, and, intellectuals, of, the, time, national, symbols, anthems, myths, flags, and, narratives, were, assiduously, constructed, by, nationalists, and, widely, adopted, the, union, jack, was, adopted, in, 1801, as, the, national, one, thomas, arne, composed, the, patriotic, song, rule, britannia, in, 1740, and, the, cartoonist, john, arbuthnot, invented, the, character, of, john, bull, as, the, personification, of, the, english, national, spirit, in, 1712, the, political, convulsions, of, the, late, 18th, century, associated, with, the, american, and, french, revolutions, massively, augmented, the, widespread, appeal, of, patriotic, nationalism, napoleon, bonaparte, s, rise, to, power, further, established, nationalism, when, he, invaded, much, of, europe, napoleon, used, this, opportunity, to, spread, revolutionary, ideas, resulting, in, much, of, the, 19th, century, european, nationalism, some, scholars, argue, that, variants, of, nationalism, emerged, prior, to, the, 18th, century, american, philosopher, and, historian, hans, kohn, wrote, in, 1944, that, nationalism, emerged, in, the, 17th, century, in, britons, forging, the, nation, 1707, 1837, linda, colley, explores, how, the, role, of, nationalism, emerged, in, about, 1700, and, developed, in, britain, reaching, full, form, in, the, 1830s, writing, shortly, after, world, war, i, the, popular, british, author, h, g, wells, traced, the, origin, of, european, nationalism, to, the, aftermath, of, the, reformation, when, it, filled, the, moral, void, left, by, the, decline, of, christian, faith, s, the, idea, of, christianity, as, a, world, brotherhood, of, men, sank, into, discredit, because, of, its, fatal, entanglement, with, priestcraft, and, the, papacy, on, the, one, hand, and, with, the, authority, of, princes, on, the, other, and, the, age, of, faith, passed, into, our, present, age, of, doubt, and, disbelief, men, shifted, the, reference, of, their, lives, from, the, kingdom, of, god, and, the, brotherhood, of, mankind, to, these, apparently, more, living, realities, france, and, england, holy, russia, spain, prussia, in, the, thirteenth, and, fourteenth, centuries, the, general, population, of, europe, was, religious, and, only, vaguely, patriotic, by, the, nineteenth, it, had, become, wholly, patriotic, the, political, development, of, nationalism, and, the, push, for, popular, sovereignty, culminated, with, the, ethnic, national, revolutions, of, europe, during, the, 19th, century, nationalism, became, one, of, the, most, significant, political, and, social, forces, in, history, it, is, typically, listed, among, the, top, causes, of, world, war, i, napoleon, s, conquests, of, the, german, and, italian, states, around, 1800, 1806, played, a, major, role, in, stimulating, nationalism, and, the, demands, for, national, unity, english, historian, j, p, t, bury, argues, between, 1830, and, 1870, nationalism, had, thus, made, great, strides, it, inspired, great, literature, quickened, scholarship, and, nurtured, heroes, it, had, shown, its, power, both, to, unify, and, to, divide, it, had, led, to, great, achievements, of, political, construction, and, consolidation, in, germany, and, italy, but, it, was, more, clear, than, ever, a, threat, to, the, ottoman, and, habsburg, empires, which, were, essentially, multi, national, european, culture, had, been, enriched, by, the, new, vernacular, contributions, of, little, known, or, forgotten, peoples, but, at, the, same, time, such, unity, as, it, had, was, imperiled, by, fragmentation, moreover, the, antagonisms, fostered, by, nationalism, had, made, not, only, for, wars, insurrections, and, local, hatreds, they, had, accentuated, or, created, new, spiritual, divisions, in, a, nominally, christian, europe, nationalism, in, france, gained, early, expressions, in, france, s, revolutionary, government, in, 1793, that, government, declared, a, mass, conscription, lev, e, en, masse, with, a, call, to, service, henceforth, until, the, enemies, have, been, driven, from, the, territory, of, the, republic, all, the, french, are, in, permanent, requisition, for, army, service, the, young, men, shall, go, to, battle, the, married, men, shall, forge, arms, in, the, hospitals, the, children, shall, turn, old, linen, to, lint, the, old, men, shall, repair, to, the, public, places, to, stimulate, the, courage, of, the, warriors, and, preach, the, unity, of, the, republic, and, the, hatred, of, kings, this, nationalism, gained, pace, after, the, french, revolution, came, to, a, close, defeat, in, war, with, a, loss, in, territory, was, a, powerful, force, in, nationalism, in, france, revenge, and, return, of, alsace, lorraine, was, a, powerful, motivating, force, for, a, quarter, century, after, their, defeat, by, germany, in, 1871, after, 1895, french, nationalists, focused, on, dreyfus, and, internal, subversion, and, the, alsace, issue, petered, out, the, french, reaction, was, a, famous, case, of, revanchism, revenge, which, demands, the, return, of, lost, territory, that, belongs, to, the, national, homeland, revanchism, draws, its, strength, from, patriotic, and, retributionist, thought, and, it, is, often, motivated, by, economic, or, geo, political, factors, extreme, revanchist, ideologues, often, represent, a, hawkish, stance, suggesting, that, their, desired, objectives, can, be, achieved, through, the, positive, outcome, of, another, war, it, is, linked, with, irredentism, the, conception, that, a, part, of, the, cultural, and, ethnic, nation, remains, unredeemed, outside, the, borders, of, its, appropriate, nation, state, revanchist, politics, often, rely, on, the, identification, of, a, nation, with, a, nation, state, often, mobilizing, deep, rooted, sentiments, of, ethnic, nationalism, claiming, territories, outside, the, state, where, members, of, the, ethnic, group, live, while, using, heavy, handed, nationalism, to, mobilize, support, for, these, aims, revanchist, justifications, are, often, presented, as, based, on, ancient, or, even, autochthonous, occupation, of, a, territory, since, time, immemorial, an, assertion, that, is, usually, inextricably, involved, in, revanchism, and, irredentism, justifying, them, in, the, eyes, of, their, proponents, the, dreyfus, affair, in, france, 1894, 1906, made, the, battle, against, treason, and, disloyalty, a, central, theme, for, conservative, catholic, french, nationalists, dreyfus, a, jew, was, an, outsider, that, is, in, the, views, of, intense, nationalists, not, a, true, frenchman, not, one, to, be, trusted, not, one, to, be, given, the, benefit, of, the, doubt, true, loyalty, to, the, nation, from, the, conservative, viewpoint, was, threatened, by, liberal, and, republican, principles, of, liberty, and, equality, that, were, leading, the, country, to, disaster, before, 1815, the, sense, of, russian, nationalism, was, weak, what, sense, there, was, focused, on, loyalty, and, obedience, to, the, tsar, the, russian, motto, orthodoxy, autocracy, and, nationality, was, coined, by, count, sergey, uvarov, and, it, was, adopted, by, emperor, nicholas, i, as, the, official, ideology, of, the, russian, empire, three, components, of, uvarov, s, triad, were, by, the, 1860s, as, a, result, of, educational, indoctrination, and, due, to, conservative, resistance, to, ideas, and, ideologies, which, were, transmitted, from, western, europe, a, pan, slavic, movement, had, emerged, and, it, produced, both, a, sense, of, russian, nationalism, and, a, nationalistic, mission, to, support, and, protect, pan, slavism, this, slavophile, movement, became, popular, in, 19th, century, russia, pan, slavism, was, fueled, by, and, it, was, also, the, fuel, for, russia, s, numerous, wars, against, the, ottoman, empire, which, were, waged, in, order, to, achieve, the, alleged, goal, of, liberating, orthodox, nationalities, such, as, bulgarians, romanians, serbs, and, greeks, from, ottoman, rule, slavophiles, opposed, the, western, european, influences, which, had, been, transmitted, to, russia, and, they, were, also, determined, to, protect, russian, culture, and, traditions, aleksey, khomyakov, ivan, kireyevsky, and, konstantin, aksakov, are, credited, with, co, founding, the, movement, an, upsurge, in, nationalism, in, latin, america, in, the, 1810s, and, 1820s, sparked, revolutions, that, cost, spain, nearly, all, of, its, colonies, which, were, located, there, spain, was, at, war, with, britain, from, 1798, to, 1808, and, the, british, royal, navy, cut, off, its, contacts, with, its, colonies, so, nationalism, flourished, and, trade, with, spain, was, suspended, the, colonies, set, up, temporary, governments, or, juntas, which, were, effectively, independent, from, spain, these, juntas, were, established, as, a, result, of, napoleon, s, resistance, failure, in, spain, they, served, to, determine, new, leadership, and, in, colonies, like, caracas, abolished, the, slave, trade, as, well, as, the, indian, tribute, the, division, exploded, between, spaniards, who, were, born, in, spain, called, peninsulares, versus, those, of, spanish, descent, born, in, new, spain, called, criollos, in, spanish, or, creoles, in, english, the, two, groups, wrestled, for, power, with, the, criollos, leading, the, call, for, independence, spain, tried, to, use, its, armies, to, fight, back, but, had, no, help, from, european, powers, indeed, britain, and, the, united, states, worked, against, spain, enforcing, the, monroe, doctrine, spain, lost, all, of, its, american, colonies, except, cuba, and, puerto, rico, in, a, complex, series, of, revolts, from, 1808, to, 1826, in, the, german, states, west, of, prussia, napoleon, abolished, many, of, the, old, or, medieval, relics, such, as, dissolving, the, holy, roman, empire, in, 1806, he, imposed, rational, legal, systems, and, demonstrated, how, dramatic, changes, were, possible, his, organization, of, the, confederation, of, the, rhine, in, 1806, promoted, a, feeling, of, nationalism, nationalists, sought, to, encompass, masculinity, in, their, quest, for, strength, and, unity, it, was, prussian, chancellor, otto, von, bismarck, who, achieved, german, unification, through, a, series, of, highly, successful, short, wars, against, denmark, austria, and, france, which, thrilled, the, pan, german, nationalists, in, the, smaller, german, states, they, fought, in, his, wars, and, eagerly, joined, the, new, german, empire, which, bismarck, ran, as, a, force, for, balance, and, peace, in, europe, after, 1871, in, the, 19th, century, german, nationalism, was, promoted, by, hegelian, oriented, academic, historians, who, saw, prussia, as, the, true, carrier, of, the, german, spirit, and, the, power, of, the, state, as, the, ultimate, goal, of, nationalism, the, three, main, historians, were, johann, gustav, droysen, 1808, 1884, heinrich, von, sybel, 1817, 1895, and, heinrich, von, treitschke, 1834, 1896, droysen, moved, from, liberalism, to, an, intense, nationalism, that, celebrated, prussian, protestantism, efficiency, progress, and, reform, in, striking, contrast, to, austrian, catholicism, impotency, and, backwardness, he, idealized, the, hohenzollern, kings, of, prussia, his, large, scale, history, of, prussian, politics, 14, vol, 1855, 1886, was, foundational, for, nationalistic, students, and, scholars, von, sybel, founded, and, edited, the, leading, academic, history, journal, historische, zeitschrift, and, as, the, director, of, the, prussian, state, archives, published, massive, compilations, that, were, devoured, by, scholars, of, nationalism, the, most, influential, of, the, german, nationalist, historians, was, treitschke, who, had, an, enormous, influence, on, elite, students, at, heidelberg, and, berlin, universities, treitschke, vehemently, attacked, parliamentarianism, socialism, pacifism, the, english, the, french, the, jews, and, the, internationalists, the, core, of, his, message, was, the, need, for, a, strong, unified, state, a, unified, germany, under, prussian, supervision, it, is, the, highest, duty, of, the, state, to, increase, its, power, he, stated, although, he, was, a, descendant, of, a, czech, family, he, considered, himself, not, slavic, but, german, i, am, 1000, times, more, the, patriot, than, a, professor, german, nationalism, expressed, through, the, ideology, of, nazism, may, also, be, understood, as, trans, national, in, nature, this, aspect, was, primarily, advocated, by, adolf, hitler, who, later, became, the, leader, of, the, nazi, party, this, party, was, devoted, to, what, they, identified, as, an, aryan, race, residing, in, various, european, countries, but, sometime, mixed, with, alien, elements, such, as, jews, meanwhile, the, nazis, rejected, many, of, the, well, established, citizens, within, those, same, countries, such, as, the, romani, gypsies, and, of, course, jews, whom, they, did, not, identify, as, aryan, a, key, nazi, doctrine, was, living, space, for, aryans, only, or, lebensraum, which, was, a, vast, undertaking, to, transplant, aryans, throughout, poland, much, of, eastern, europe, and, the, baltic, nations, and, all, of, western, russia, and, ukraine, lebensraum, was, thus, a, vast, project, for, advancing, the, aryan, race, far, outside, of, any, particular, nation, or, national, borders, the, nazi, s, goals, were, racist, focused, on, advancing, the, aryan, race, as, they, perceived, it, eugenics, modification, of, the, human, race, and, the, eradication, of, human, beings, that, they, deemed, inferior, but, their, goals, were, trans, national, and, intended, to, spread, across, as, much, of, the, world, as, they, could, achieve, although, nazism, glorified, german, history, it, also, embraced, the, supposed, virtues, and, achievements, of, the, aryan, race, in, other, countries, including, india, the, nazis, aryanism, longed, for, now, extinct, species, of, superior, bulls, once, used, as, livestock, by, aryans, and, other, features, of, aryan, history, that, never, resided, within, the, borders, of, germany, as, a, nation, italian, nationalism, emerged, in, the, 19th, century, and, was, the, driving, force, for, italian, unification, or, the, risorgimento, meaning, the, resurgence, or, revival, it, was, the, political, and, intellectual, movement, that, consolidated, the, different, states, of, the, italian, peninsula, into, the, single, state, of, the, kingdom, of, italy, in, 1861, the, memory, of, the, risorgimento, is, central, to, italian, nationalism, but, it, was, based, in, the, liberal, middle, classes, and, ultimately, proved, a, bit, weak, the, new, government, treated, the, newly, annexed, south, as, a, kind, of, underdeveloped, province, due, to, its, backward, and, poverty, stricken, society, its, poor, grasp, of, standard, italian, as, italo, dalmatian, dialects, of, neapolitan, and, sicilian, were, prevalent, in, the, common, use, and, its, local, traditions, the, liberals, had, always, been, strong, opponents, of, the, pope, and, the, very, well, organized, catholic, church, the, liberal, government, under, the, sicilian, francesco, crispi, sought, to, enlarge, his, political, base, by, emulating, otto, von, bismarck, and, firing, up, italian, nationalism, with, an, aggressive, foreign, policy, it, partially, crashed, and, his, cause, was, set, back, of, his, nationalistic, foreign, policy, historian, r, j, b, bosworth, says, pursued, policies, whose, openly, aggressive, character, would, not, be, equaled, until, the, days, of, the, fascist, regime, crispi, increased, military, expenditure, talked, cheerfully, of, a, european, conflagration, and, alarmed, his, german, or, british, friends, with, these, suggestions, of, preventative, attacks, on, his, enemies, his, policies, were, ruinous, both, for, italy, s, trade, with, france, and, more, humiliatingly, for, colonial, ambitions, in, east, africa, crispi, s, lust, for, territory, there, was, thwarted, when, on, 1, march, 1896, the, armies, of, ethiopian, emperor, menelik, routed, italian, forces, at, adowa, in, what, has, been, defined, as, an, unparalleled, disaster, for, a, modern, army, crispi, whose, private, life, and, personal, finances, were, objects, of, perennial, scandal, went, into, dishonorable, retirement, italy, joined, the, allies, in, the, first, world, war, after, getting, promises, of, territory, but, its, war, effort, was, not, honored, after, the, war, and, this, fact, discredited, liberalism, paving, the, way, for, benito, mussolini, and, a, political, doctrine, of, his, own, creation, fascism, mussolini, s, 20, year, dictatorship, involved, a, highly, aggressive, nationalism, that, led, to, a, series, of, wars, with, the, creation, of, the, italian, empire, an, alliance, with, hitler, s, germany, and, humiliation, and, hardship, in, the, second, world, war, after, 1945, the, catholics, returned, to, government, and, tensions, eased, somewhat, but, the, former, two, sicilies, remained, poor, and, partially, underdeveloped, by, industrial, country, standards, in, the, 1950s, and, early, 1960s, italy, had, an, economic, boom, that, pushed, its, economy, to, the, fifth, place, in, the, world, the, working, class, in, those, decades, voted, mostly, for, the, communist, party, and, it, looked, to, moscow, rather, than, rome, for, inspiration, and, was, kept, out, of, the, national, government, even, as,

s, padanism, in, the, 1980s, whose, party, lega, nord, has, come, to, partially, embrace, a, moderate, version, of, italian, nationalism, over, the, years, and, other, separatist, movements, spread, across, the, country, after, the, war, of, the, spanish, succession, rooted, in, the, political, position, of, the, count, duke, of, olivares, and, the, absolutism, of, philip, v, the, assimilation, of, the, crown, of, aragon, by, the, castilian, crown, through, the, decrees, of, nova, planta, was, the, first, step, in, the, creation, of, the, spanish, nation, state, as, in, other, contemporary, european, states, political, union, was, the, first, step, in, the, creation, of, the, spanish, nation, state, in, this, case, not, on, a, uniform, ethnic, basis, but, through, the, imposition, of, the, political, and, cultural, characteristics, of, the, dominant, ethnic, group, in, this, case, the, castilians, over, those, of, other, ethnic, groups, who, became, national, minorities, to, be, assimilated, in, fact, since, the, political, unification, of, 1714, spanish, assimilation, policies, towards, catalan, speaking, territories, catalonia, valencia, the, balearic, islands, part, of, aragon, and, other, national, minorities, as, basques, and, galicians, have, been, a, historical, constant, the, nationalization, process, accelerated, in, the, 19th, century, in, parallel, to, the, origin, of, spanish, nationalism, the, social, political, and, ideological, movement, that, tried, to, shape, a, spanish, national, identity, based, on, the, castilian, model, in, conflict, with, the, other, historical, nations, of, the, state, politicians, of, the, time, were, aware, that, despite, the, aggressive, policies, pursued, up, to, that, time, the, uniform, and, monocultural, spanish, nation, did, not, exist, as, indicated, in, 1835, by, antonio, alcal, galiano, when, in, the, cortes, del, estatuto, real, he, defended, the, effort, to, make, the, spanish, nation, a, nation, that, neither, is, nor, has, been, until, now, building, the, nation, as, in, france, it, was, the, state, that, created, the, nation, and, not, the, opposite, process, is, an, ideal, that, the, spanish, elites, constantly, reiterated, and, one, hundred, years, later, than, alcal, galiano, for, example, we, can, also, find, it, in, the, mouth, of, the, fascist, jos, pemart, n, who, admired, the, german, and, italian, modeling, policies, there, is, an, intimate, and, decisive, dualism, both, in, italian, fascism, and, in, german, national, socialism, on, the, one, hand, the, hegelian, doctrine, of, the, absolutism, of, the, state, is, felt, the, state, originates, in, the, nation, educates, and, shapes, the, mentality, of, the, individual, is, in, mussolini, s, words, the, soul, of, the, soul, and, will, be, found, again, two, hundred, years, later, from, the, socialist, josep, borrell, the, modern, history, of, spain, is, an, unfortunate, history, that, meant, that, we, did, not, consolidate, a, modern, state, independentists, think, that, the, nation, makes, the, state, i, think, the, opposite, the, state, makes, the, nation, a, strong, state, which, imposes, its, language, culture, education, the, creation, of, the, tradition, of, the, political, community, of, spaniards, as, common, destiny, over, other, communities, has, been, argued, to, trace, back, to, the, cortes, of, c, diz, from, 1812, on, revisiting, the, previous, history, of, spain, spanish, liberalism, tended, to, take, for, granted, the, national, conscience, and, the, spanish, nation, a, by, product, of, 19th, century, spanish, nationalist, thinking, is, the, concept, of, reconquista, which, holds, the, power, of, propelling, the, weaponized, notion, of, spain, being, a, nation, shaped, against, islam, the, strong, interface, of, nationalism, with, colonialism, is, another, feature, of, 19th, century, nation, building, in, spain, with, the, defence, of, slavery, and, colonialism, in, cuba, being, often, able, to, reconcile, tensions, between, mainland, elites, of, catalonia, and, madrid, throughout, the, period, during, the, first, half, of, 20th, century, notably, during, the, dictatorship, of, primo, de, rivera, and, the, dictatorship, of, franco, a, new, brand, of, spanish, nationalism, with, a, marked, military, flavour, and, an, authoritarian, stance, as, well, as, promoting, policies, favouring, the, spanish, language, against, the, other, languages, in, the, country, as, a, means, of, modernizing, the, country, was, developed, by, spanish, conservatives, fusing, regenerationist, principles, with, traditional, spanish, nationalism, the, authoritarian, national, ideal, resumed, during, the, francoist, dictatorship, in, the, form, of, national, catholicism, which, was, in, turn, complemented, by, the, myth, of, hispanidad, a, distinct, manifestation, of, spanish, nationalism, in, modern, spanish, politics, is, the, interchange, of, attacks, with, competing, regional, nationalisms, initially, present, after, the, end, of, francoism, in, a, rather, diffuse, and, reactive, form, the, spanish, nationalist, discourse, has, been, often, self, branded, as, constitutional, patriotism, since, the, 1980s, often, ignored, as, in, the, case, of, other, state, nationalisms, its, alleged, non, existence, has, been, a, commonplace, espoused, by, prominent, figures, in, the, public, sphere, as, well, as, the, mass, media, in, the, country, during, the, early, 19th, century, inspired, by, romanticism, classicism, former,

under, ottoman, rule, in, the, late, 18th, and, early, 19th, century, under, the, influence, of, western, ideas, such, as, liberalism, and, nationalism, which, trickled, into, the, country, after, the, french, revolution, the, bulgarian, national, revival, started, with, the, work, of, saint, paisius, of, hilendar, who, opposed, greek, domination, of, bulgaria, s, culture, and, religion, his, work, istoriya, slavyanobolgarskaya, history, of, the, slav, bulgarians, which, appeared, in, 1762, was, the, first, work, of, bulgarian, historiography, it, is, considered, paisius, greatest, work, and, one, of, the, greatest, pieces, of, bulgarian, literature, in, it, paisius, interpreted, bulgarian, medieval, history, with, the, goal, of, reviving, the, spirit, of, his, nation, his, successor, was, saint, sophronius, of, vratsa, who, started, the, struggle, for, an, independent, bulgarian, church, an, autonomous, bulgarian, exarchate, was, established, in, 1870, 1872, for, the, bulgarian, diocese, wherein, at, least, two, thirds, of, orthodox, christians, were, willing, to, join, it, in, 1869, the, internal, revolutionary, organization, was, initiated, the, april, uprising, of, 1876, indirectly, resulted, in, the, re, establishment, of, bulgaria, in, 1878, jewish, nationalism, arose, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 19th, century, largely, as, a, response, to, the, rise, of, nation, states, traditionally, jews, lived, under, uncertain, and, oppressive, conditions, in, western, europe, jews, not, subject, to, such, restrictions, since, emancipation, of, early, 19th, century, often, assimilated, into, the, dominant, culture, both, assimilation, and, the, traditional, second, class, status, of, jews, were, considered, as, threats, to, the, jewish, identity, by, jewish, nationalists, the, method, of, combatting, these, threats, were, different, among, different, national, movements, among, jews, zionism, ultimately, the, most, successful, of, jewish, nationalist, movements, advocated, in, the, creation, of, a, jewish, state, in, the, land, of, israel, labour, zionism, hoped, that, the, new, jewish, state, would, be, based, on, socialist, principles, they, imagined, a, new, jew, that, in, contrast, to, the, jews, of, the, diaspora, was, strong, worked, the, land, and, spoke, hebrew, religious, zionism, instead, had, various, religious, reasonings, for, returning, to, israel, although, according, to, historian, david, engel, zionism, was, more, about, fear, that, jews, would, end, up, dispersed, and, unprotected, rather, than, fulfilling, old, prophecies, of, historical, texts, the, efforts, of, the, zionist, movement, culminated, in, the, establishment, of, the, state, of, israel, jewish, territorialism, split, from, the, zionist, movement, in, 1903, arguing, for, a, jewish, state, no, matter, where, as, more, jews, moved, to, palestine, the, main, territorialist, organization, lost, support, eventually, disbanding, in, the, 1925, smaller, territorialist, movements, lasted, until, the, establishment, of, the, state, of, israel, jewish, autonomism, and, bundism, instead, advocated, for, jewish, national, autonomy, within, the, territory, they, already, lived, in, most, manifestations, of, this, movement, were, left, wing, in, nature, and, actively, anti, zionist, while, successful, among, eastern, european, jews, in, the, early, 20th, century, it, lost, most, of, its, support, due, to, the, holocaust, although, some, support, lasted, through, the, 20th, century, the, awakening, of, nationalism, across, asia, helped, shape, the, history, of, the, continent, the, key, episode, was, the, decisive, defeat, of, russia, by, japan, in, 1905, demonstrating, the, military, advancement, of, non, europeans,

strongly, influenced, by, sun, s, nationalism, as, well, as, by, the, may, fourth, movement, in, 1919, it, was, a, nationwide, protest, movement, about, the, domestic, backwardness, of, china, and, has, often, been, depicted, as, the, intellectual, foundation, for, chinese, communism, the, new, culture, movement, stimulated, by, the, may, fourth, movement, waxed, strong, throughout, the, 1920s,

lead, to, a, group, fighting, to, survive, especially, as, after, the, fall, of, communism, political, boundaries, did, not, match, ethnic, boundaries, serious, conflicts, often, arose, and,

southern, territory, that, combined, with, escalating, violence, from, ethnic, albanians, and, serbs, in, kosovo, intensified, economic, conditions, the, violence, greatly, contributed, to, the, rise, of, extreme, nationalism, of, serbs, in, serbia, and, the, rest, of, yugoslavia, the, ongoing, conflict, in, kosovo, was, propagandized, by, a, communist, serb, slobodan, milo, evi, to, increase, serb, nationalism, further, as, mentioned, that, nationalism, gave, rise, to, powerful, emotions, which, grew, the, force, of, serbian, nationalism, by, highly, nationalist, demonstrations, in, vojvodina, serbia, montenegro, and, kosovo, serbian, nationalism, was, so, high, that, slobodan, milo, evi, ousted, leaders, in, vojvodina, and, montenegro, repressed, albanians, within, kosovo, and, eventually, controlled, four, of, the, eight, regions, territories, slovenia, one, of, the, four, regions, not, under, communist, control, favoured, a, democratic, state, in, slovenia, fear, was, mounting, because, milo, evi, would, use, the, militia, to, suppress, the, country, as, had, occurred, in, kosovo, half, of, yugoslavia, wanted, to, be, democratic, the, other, wanted, a, new, nationalist, authoritarian, regime, in, fall, of, 1989, tensions, came, to, a, head, and, slovenia, asserted, its, political, and, economic, independence, from, yugoslavia, and, seceded, in, january, 1990, there, was, a, total, break, with, serbia, at, the, league, of, communists, of, yugoslavia, an, institution, that, had, been, conceived, by, milo, evi, to, strengthen, unity, and, later, became, the, backdrop, for, the, fall, of, communism, in, yugoslavia, in, august, 1990, a, warning, to, the, region, was, issued, when, ethnically, divided, groups, attempted, to, alter, the, government, structure, the, republic, borders, established, by, the, communist, regime, in, the, postwar, period, were, extremely, vulnerable, to, challenges, from, ethnic, communities, ethnic, communities, arose, because, they, did, not, share, the, identity, with, everyone, within, the, new, post, communist, borders, which, threatened, the, new, governments, the, same, disputes, were, erupting, that, were, in, place, prior, to, milo, evi, and, were, compounded, by, actions, from, his, regime, also, within, the, territory, the, croats, and, the, serbs, were, in, direct, competition, for, control, of, government, elections, were, held, and, increased, potential, conflicts, between, serbian, and, croat, nationalism, serbia, wanted, to, be, separate, and, to, decide, its, own, future, based, on, its, own, ethnic, composition, but, that, would, then, give, kosovo, encouragement, to, become, independent, from, serbia, albanians, in, kosovo, were, already, practically, independent, from, kosovo, but, serbia, did, not, want, to, let, kosovo, become, independent, albanian, nationalists, wanted, their, own, territory, but, that, would, require, a, redrawing, of, the, map, and, threaten, neighboring, territories, when, communism, fell, in, yugoslavia, serious, conflict, arose, which, led, to, the, rise, in, extreme, nationalism, nationalism, again, gave, rise, to, powerful, emotions, which, evoked, in, some, extreme, cases, a, willingness, to, die, for, what, one, believed, a, fight, for, the, survival, of, the, group, the, end, of, communism, began, a, long, period, of, conflict, and, war, for, the, region, for, six, years, 200, 000, 500, 000, people, died, in, the, bosnian, war, all, three, major, ethnicities, in, bosnia, and, herzegovina, bosnian, muslims, croats, serbs, suffered, at, the, hands, of, each, other, the, war, garnered, assistance, from, groups, muslim, orthodox, and, western, christian, and, from, state, actors, which, supplied, all, sides, saudi, arabia, and, iran, supported, bosnia, russia, supported, serbia, central, european, and, the, west, including, the, us, supported, croatia, and, the, pope, supported, slovenia, and, croatia, the, rise, of, globalism, in, the, late, 20th, century, led, to, a, rise, in, nationalism, and, populism, in, europe, and, north, america, that, trend, was, further, fueled, by, increased, terrorism, in, the, west, the, september, 11, attacks, in, the, united, states, being, a, prime, example, increasing, unrest, and, civil, wars, in, the, middle, east, and, waves, of, muslim, refugees, especially, from, the, syrian, civil, war, flooding, into, europe, as, of, 2016, the, refugee, crisis, appears, to, have, peaked, nationalist, groups, like, germany, s, pegida, france, s, national, front, and, the, uk, independence, party, gained, prominence, in, their, respective, nations, advocating, restrictions, on, immigration, to, protect, the, local, populations, since, 2010, catalan, nationalists, have, led, a, renewed, catalan, independence, movement, and, declared, catalan, independence, the, movement, has, been, opposed, by, spanish, nationalists, in, the, 2010s, the, greek, economic, crisis, and, waves, of, immigration, have, led, to, a, significant, rise, of, fascism, and, greek, nationalism, across, greece, especially, among, the, youth, in, russia, exploitation, of, nationalist, sentiments, allowed, vladimir, putin, to, consolidate, power, this, nationalist, sentiment, was, used, in, russia, s, annexation, of, crimea, in, 2014, and, other, actions, in, ukraine, nationalist, movements, gradually, began, to, rise, in, central, europe, as, well, particularly, poland, under, the, influence, of, the, ruling, party, law, and, justice, led, by, jaros, aw, kaczy, ski, in, hungary, the, anti, immigration, rhetoric, and, stance, against, foreign, influence, is, a, powerful, national, glue, promoted, the, ruling, fidesz, party, led, by, viktor, orb, n, nationalist, parties, have, also, joined, governing, coalitions, in, bulgaria, slovakia, latvia, and, ukraine, in, india, hindu, nationalism, has, grown, in, popularity, with, the, rise, of, the, bharatiya, janata, party, a, right, wing, party, which, has, been, ruling, india, at, the, national, level, since, 2014, the, rise, in, religious, nationalism, comes, with, the, rise, of, right, wing, populism, in, india, with, the, election, and, re, election, of, populist, leader, narendra, modi, as, prime, minister, who, promised, economic, prosperity, for, all, and, an, end, to, corruption, militant, buddhist, nationalism, is, also, on, the, rise, in, myanmar, thailand, and, sri, lanka, in, japan, nationalist, influences, in, the, government, developed, over, the, course, of, the, early, 21st, century, largely, from, the, far, right, ultra, conservative, nippon, kaigi, organization, the, new, movement, has, advocated, re, establishing, japan, as, a, military, power, and, pushed, revisionist, historical, narratives, denying, events, such, as, the, nanking, massacre, a, referendum, on, scottish, independence, from, the, united, kingdom, was, held, on, 18, september, 2014, the, proposal, was, defeated, with, 55, 3, voting, against, independence, in, a, 2016, referendum, the, british, populace, unexpectedly, voted, to, withdraw, the, united, kingdom, from, the, european, union, known, as, brexit, as, the, promise, of, continued, european, union, membership, was, a, core, feature, of, the, anti, independence, campaign, during, the, scottish, referendum, there, have, been, calls, for, a, second, referendum, on, scottish, independence, the, 2016, united, states, presidential, campaign, saw, the, unprecedented, rise, of, donald, trump, a, businessman, with, no, political, experience, who, ran, on, a, populist, nationalist, platform, and, struggled, to, gain, endorsements, from, mainstream, political, figures, even, within, his, own, party, trump, s, slogans, make, america, great, again, and, america, first, exemplified, his, campaign, s, repudiation, of, globalism, and, its, staunchly, nationalistic, outlook, his, unexpected, victory, in, the, election, was, seen, as, part, of, the, same, trend, that, had, brought, about, the, brexit, vote, on, 22, october, 2018, two, weeks, before, the, mid, term, elections, president, trump, openly, proclaimed, that, he, was, a, nationalist, to, a, cheering, crowd, at, a, rally, in, texas, in, support, of, re, electing, senator, ted, cruz, who, was, once, an, adversary, on, 29, october, 2018, trump, equated, nationalism, to, patriotism, saying, i, m, proud, of, this, country, and, i, call, that, nationalism, in, 2016, rodrigo, duterte, became, president, of, the, philippines, running, a, distinctly, nationalist, campaign, contrary, to, the, policies, of, his, recent, predecessors, he, distanced, the, country, from, the, philippines, former, ruler, the, united, states, and, sought, closer, ties, with, china, as, well, as, russia, in, 2017, turkish, nationalism, propelled, president, recep, tayyip, erdo, an, to, gain, unprecedented, power, in, a, national, referendum, reactions, from, world, leaders, were, mixed, with, western, european, leaders, generally, expressing, concern, while, the, leaders, of, many, of, the, more, authoritarian, regimes, as, well, as, president, trump, offered, their, congratulations, many, political, scientists, have, theorized, about, the, foundations, of, the, modern, nation, state, and, the, concept, of, sovereignty, the, concept, of, nationalism, in, political, science, draws, from, these, theoretical, foundations, philosophers, like, machiavelli, locke, hobbes, and, rousseau, conceptualized, the, state, as, the, result, of, a, social, contract, between, rulers, and, individuals, max, weber, provides, the, most, commonly, used, definition, of, the, state, that, human, community, which, successfully, lays, claim, to, the, monopoly, of, legitimate, physical, violence, within, a, certain, territory, according, to, benedict, anderson, nations, are, imagined, communities, or, socially, constructed, institutions, many, scholars, have, noted, the, relationship, between, state, building, war, and, nationalism, john, etherington, argues, nationalism, is, inherently, exclusionary, and, thus, potentially, violent, while, jeffrey, herbst, posits, that, external, threats, can, foster, nationalist, sentiment, external, threats, have, such, a, powerful, effect, on, nationalism, because, people, realize, in, a, profound, manner, that, they, are, under, threat, because, of, who, they, are, as, a, nation, they, are, forced, to, recognize, that, it, is, only, as, a, nation, that, they, can, successfully, defeat, the, threat, with, increased, external, threats, the, state, s, extractive, capacities, increase, he, links, the, lack, of, external, threats, to, countries, in, sub, saharan, africa, post, independence, to, weak, state, nationalism, and, state, capacity, barry, posen, argues, that, nationalism, increases, the, intensity, of, war, and, that, states, deliberately, promote, nationalism, with, the, aim, of, improving, their, military, capabilities, most, new, nation, states, since, 1815, have, emerged, through, decolonization, adria, lawrence, has, argued, that, nationalism, in, the, colonial, world, was, spurred, by, failures, of, colonial, powers, to, extend, equal, political, rights, to, the, subjects, in, the, colonies, thus, prompting, them, to, pursue, independence, michael, hechter, has, argued, similarly, that, peripheral, nationalisms, formed, when, empires, prevented, peripheral, regions, from, having, autonomy, and, local, rule, the, sociological, or, modernist, interpretation, of, nationalism, and, nation, building, argues, that, nationalism, arises, and, flourishes, in, modern, societies, that, have, an, industrial, economy, capable, of, self, sustainability, a, central, supreme, authority, capable, of, maintaining, authority, and, unity, and, a, centralized, language, understood, by, a, community, of, people, modernist, theorists, note, that, this, is, only, possible, in, modern, societies, while, traditional, societies, typically, lack, the, prerequisites, for, nationalism, they, lack, a, modern, self, sustainable, economy, have, divided, authorities, and, use, multiple, languages, resulting, in, many, groups, being, unable, to, communicate, with, each, other, prominent, theorists, who, developed, the, modernist, interpretation, of, nations, and, nationalism, include, carlton, j, h, hayes, henry, maine, ferdinand, t, nnies, rabindranath, tagore, mile, durkheim, max, weber, arnold, joseph, toynbee, and, talcott, parsons, in, his, analysis, of, the, historical, changes, and, development, of, human, societies, henry, maine, noted, that, the, key, distinction, between, traditional, societies, defined, as, status, societies, based, on, family, association, and, functionally, diffuse, roles, for, individuals, and, modern, societies, defined, as, contract, societies, where, social, relations, are, determined, by, rational, contracts, pursued, by, individuals, to, advance, their, interests, maine, saw, the, development, of, societies, as, moving, away, from, traditional, status, societies, to, modern, contract, societies, in, his, book, gemeinschaft, und, gesellschaft, 1887, ferdinand, t, nnies, defined, a, gemeinschaft, community, as, being, based, on, emotional, attachments, as, attributed, with, traditional, societies, while, defining, a, gesellschaft, society, as, an, impersonal, society, that, is, modern, although, he, recognized, the, advantages, of, modern, societies, he, also, criticized, them, for, their, cold, and, impersonal, nature, that, caused, alienation, while, praising, the, intimacy, of, traditional, communities, mile, durkheim, expanded, upon, t, nnies, recognition, of, alienation, and, defined, the, differences, between, traditional, and, modern, societies, as, being, between, societies, based, upon, mechanical, solidarity, versus, societies, based, on, organic, solidarity, durkheim, identified, mechanical, solidarity, as, involving, custom, habit, and, repression, that, was, necessary, to, maintain, shared, views, durkheim, identified, organic, solidarity, based, societies, as, modern, societies, where, there, exists, a, division, of, labour, based, on, social, differentiation, that, causes, alienation, durkheim, claimed, that, social, integration, in, traditional, society, required, authoritarian, culture, involving, acceptance, of, a, social, order, durkheim, claimed, that, modern, society, bases, integration, on, the, mutual, benefits, of, the, division, of, labour, but, noted, that, the, impersonal, character, of, modern, urban, life, caused, alienation, and, feelings, of, anomie, max, weber, claimed, the, change, that, developed, modern, society, and, nations, is, the, result, of, the, rise, of, a, charismatic, leader, to, power, in, a, society, who, creates, a, new, tradition, or, a, rational, legal, system, that, establishes, the, supreme, authority, of, the, state, weber, s, conception, of, charismatic, authority, has, been, noted, as, the, basis, of, many, nationalist, governments, the, primordialist, perspective, is, based, upon, evolutionary, theory, this, approach, has, been, popular, with, the, general, public, but, is, typically, rejected, by, experts, laland, and, brown, report, that, the, vast, majority, of, professional, academics, in, the, social, sciences, not, only, ignore, evolutionary, methods, but, in, many, cases, extremely, hostile, to, the, arguments, that, draw, vast, generalizations, from, rather, limited, evidence, the, evolutionary, theory, of, nationalism, perceives, nationalism, to, be, the, result, of, the, evolution, of, human, beings, into, identifying, with, groups, such, as, ethnic, groups, or, other, groups, that, form, the, foundation, of, a, nation, roger, masters, in, the, nature, of, politics, describes, the, primordial, explanation, of, the, origin, of, ethnic, and, national, groups, as, recognizing, group, attachments, that, are, thought, to, be, unique, emotional, intense, and, durable, because, they, are, based, upon, kinship, and, promoted, along, lines, of, common, ancestry, the, primordialist, evolutionary, views, of, nationalism, often, reference, the, evolutionary, theories, of, charles, darwin, as, well, as, social, darwinist, views, of, the, late, nineteenth, century, thinkers, like, herbert, spencer, and, walter, bagehot, reinterpreted, darwin, s, theory, of, natural, selection, often, in, ways, inconsistent, with, charles, darwin, s, theory, of, evolution, by, making, unsupported, claims, of, biological, difference, among, groups, ethnicities, races, and, nations, modern, evolutionary, sciences, have, distanced, themselves, from, such, views, but, notions, of, long, term, evolutionary, change, remain, foundational, to, the, work, of, evolutionary, psychologists, like, john, tooby, and, leda, cosmides, approached, through, the, primordialist, perspective, the, example, of, seeing, the, mobilization, of, a, foreign, military, force, on, the, nation, s, borders, may, provoke, members, of, a, national, group, to, unify, and, mobilize, themselves, in, response, there, are, proximate, environments, where, individuals, identify, nonimmediate, real, or, imagined, situations, in, combination, with, immediate, situations, that, make, individuals, confront, a, common, situation, of, both, subjective, and, objective, components, that, affect, their, decisions, as, such, proximate, environments, cause, people, to, make, decisions, based, on, existing, situations, and, anticipated, situations, critics, argue, that, primordial, models, relying, on, evolutionary, psychology, are, based, not, on, historical, evidence, but, on, assumptions, of, unobserved, changes, over, thousands, of, years, and, assume, stable, genetic, composition, of, the, population, living, in, a, specific, area, and, are, incapable, of, handling, the, contingencies, that, characterize, every, known, historical, process, robert, hislope, argues, he, articulation, of, cultural, evolutionary, theory, represents, theoretical, progress, over, sociobiology, but, its, explanatory, payoff, remains, limited, due, to, the, role, of, contingency, in, human, affairs, and, the, significance, of, non, evolutionary, proximate, causal, factors, while, evolutionary, theory, undoubtedly, elucidates, the, development, of, all, organic, life, it, would, seem, to, operate, best, at, macro, levels, of, analysis, distal, points, of, explanation, and, from, the, perspective, of, the, long, term, hence, it, is, bound, to, display, shortcomings, at, micro, level, events, that, are, highly, contingent, in, nature, in, 1920, english, historian, g, p, gooch, argued, that, in, the, communist, manifesto, karl, marx, and, friedrich, engels, declared, that, the, working, men, have, no, country, vladimir, lenin, supported, the, concept, of, self, determination, joseph, stalin, s, marxism, and, the, national, question, 1913, declares, that, a, nation, is, not, a, racial, or, tribal, but, a, historically, constituted, community, of, people, a, nation, is, not, a, casual, or, ephemeral, conglomeration, but, a, stable, community, of, people, a, nation, is, formed, only, as, a, result, of, lengthy, and, systematic, intercourse, as, a, result, of, people, living, together, generation, after, generation, and, in, its, entirety, a, nation, is, a, historically, constituted, stable, community, of, people, formed, on, the, basis, of, a, common, language, territory, economic, life, and, psychological, make, up, manifested, in, a, common, culture, historians, sociologists, and, anthropologists, have, debated, different, types, of, nationalism, since, at, least, the, 1930s, generally, the, most, common, way, of, classifying, nationalism, has, been, to, describe, movements, as, having, either, civic, or, ethnic, nationalist, characteristics, this, distinction, was, popularized, in, the, 1950s, by, hans, kohn, who, described, civic, nationalism, as, western, and, more, democratic, while, depicting, ethnic, nationalism, as, eastern, and, undemocratic, since, the, 1980s, scholars, of, nationalism, have, pointed, out, numerous, flaws, in, this, rigid, division, and, proposed, more, specific, classifications, and, numerous, varieties, anti, colonial, nationalism, is, an, intellectual, framework, that, preceded, accompanied, and, followed, the, process, of, decolonization, in, the, mid, 1900s, benedict, anderson, defined, a, nation, as, a, socially, constructed, community, that, is, co, created, by, individuals, who, imagine, themselves, as, part, of, this, group, he, points, to, the, new, world, as, the, site, that, originally, conceived, of, nationalism, as, a, concept, which, is, defined, by, its, imagination, of, an, ahistorical, identity, that, negates, colonialism, by, definition, this, concept, of, nationalism, was, exemplified, by, the, transformation, of, settler, colonies, into, nations, while, anti, colonial, nationalism, is, exemplified, by, movements, against, colonial, powers, in, the, 1900s, nationalist, mobilization, in, french, colonial, africa, and, british, colonial, india, developed, when, colonial, regimes, refused, to, cede, rights, to, their, increasingly, well, educated, colonial, subjects, who, formed, indigenous, elites, and, strategically, adopted, and, adapted, nationalist, tactics, new, national, identities, may, cross, pre, existing, ethnic, or, linguistic, divisions, anti, colonial, independence, movements, in, africa, and, asia, in, the, 1900s, were, led, by, individuals, who, had, a, set, of, shared, identities, and, imagined, a, homeland, without, external, rule, anderson, argues, that, the, racism, often, experienced, as, a, result, of, colonial, rule, and, attributed, to, nationalism, is, rather, due, to, theories, of, class, gellner, s, theory, of, nationalism, argues, that, nationalism, works, for, combining, one, culture, or, ethnicity, in, one, state, which, leads, to, that, state, s, success, for, gellner, nationalism, is, ethnic, and, state, political, parties, should, reflect, the, ethnic, majority, in, the, state, this, definition, of, nationalism, also, contributes, to, anti, colonial, nationalism, if, one, conceives, of, anti, colonial, movements, to, be, movements, consisting, of, one, specific, ethnic, group, against, an, outside, ruling, party, edward, said, also, saw, nationalism, as, ethnic, at, least, in, part, and, argued, that, nationalist, narratives, often, go, hand, in, hand, with, racism, as, communities, define, themselves, in, relation, to, the, other, anti, colonial, nationalism, is, not, static, and, is, defined, by, different, forms, of, nationalism, depending, on, location, in, the, anti, colonial, movement, that, took, place, in, the, indian, subcontinent, mahatma, gandhi, and, his, allies, in, the, indian, independence, movement, argued, for, a, composite, nationalism, not, believing, that, an, independent, indian, nation, should, be, defined, by, its, religious, identity, despite, large, scale, opposition, by, congress, supporters, the, insistence, of, the, muslims, under, the, separatist, muslim, league, resulted, in, the, indian, subcontinent, being, partitioned, into, two, states, in, 1947, along, religious, lines, into, the, muslim, majority, dominion, of, pakistan, and, the, hindu, majority, dominion, of, india, because, of, colonialism, s, creation, of, state, and, country, lines, across, ethnic, religious, linguistic, and, other, historical, boundaries, anti, colonial, nationalism, is, largely, related, to, land, first, after, independence, especially, in, countries, with, particularly, diverse, populations, with, historic, enmity, there, have, been, a, series, of, smaller, independence, movements, that, are, also, defined, by, anti, colonialism, philosopher, and, scholar, achille, mbembe, argues, that, post, colonialism, is, a, contradictory, term, because, colonialism, is, ever, present, those, that, participate, in, this, intellectual, practice, envision, a, post, colonialism, despite, its, being, the, defining, frame, for, the, world, this, is, the, case, with, anti, colonialism, as, well, anti, colonial, nationalism, as, an, intellectual, framework, persisted, into, the, late, 20th, century, with, the, resistance, movements, in, soviet, satellite, states, and, continues, with, independence, movements, in, the, arab, world, in, the, 21st, century, civic, nationalism, defines, the, nation, as, an, association, of, people, who, identify, themselves, as, belonging, to, the, nation, who, have, equal, and, shared, political, rights, and, allegiance, to, similar, political, procedures, according, to, the, principles, of, civic, nationalism, the, nation, is, not, based, on, common, ethnic, ancestry, but, is, a, political, entity, whose, core, identity, is, not, ethnicity, this, civic, concept, of, nationalism, is, exemplified, by, ernest, renan, in, his, lecture, in, 1882, what, is, a, nation, where, he, defined, the, nation, as, a, daily, referendum, frequently, translated, daily, plebiscite, dependent, on, the, will, of, its, people, to, continue, living, together, civic, nationalism, is, normally, associated, with, liberal, nationalism, although, the, two, are, distinct, and, did, not, always, coincide, on, the, one, hand, until, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, century, adherents, to, anti, enlightenment, movements, such, as, french, legitimism, or, spanish, carlism, often, rejected, the, liberal, national, unitary, state, yet, identified, themselves, not, with, an, ethnic, nation, but, with, a, non, national, dynasty, and, regional, feudal, privileges, xenophobic, movements, in, long, established, western, european, states, indeed, often, took, a, civic, national, form, rejecting, a, given, group, s, ability, to, assimilate, with, the, nation, due, to, its, belonging, to, a, cross, border, community, irish, catholics, in, britain, ashkenazic, jews, in, france, on, the, other, hand, while, subnational, separatist, movements, were, commonly, associated, with, ethnic, nationalism, this, was, not, always, so, and, such, nationalists, as, the, corsican, republic, united, irishmen, breton, federalist, league, or, catalan, republican, party, could, combine, a, rejection, of, the, unitary, civic, national, state, with, a, belief, in, liberal, universalism, liberal, nationalism, is, commonly, considered, to, be, compatible, with, liberal, values, of, freedom, tolerance, equality, and, individual, rights, ernest, renan, and, john, stuart, mill, are, often, thought, to, be, early, liberal, nationalists, liberal, nationalists, often, defend, the, value, of, national, identity, by, saying, that, individuals, need, a, national, identity, to, lead, meaningful, autonomous, lives, and, that, liberal, democratic, polities, need, national, identity, to, function, properly, civic, nationalism, lies, within, the, traditions, of, rationalism, and, liberalism, but, as, a, form, of, nationalism, it, is, usually, contrasted, with, ethnic, nationalism, civic, nationalism, is, correlated, with, long, established, states, whose, dynastic, rulers, had, gradually, acquired, multiple, distinct, territories, with, little, change, to, boundaries, but, which, contained, historical, populations, of, multiple, linguistic, and, or, confessional, backgrounds, since, individuals, living, within, different, parts, of, the, state, territory, might, have, little, obvious, common, ground, civic, nationalism, developed, as, a, way, for, rulers, to, both, explain, a, contemporary, reason, for, such, heterogeneity, and, to, provide, a, common, purpose, ernest, renan, s, classic, description, in, what, is, a, nation, 1882, as, a, voluntary, partnership, for, a, common, endeavor, renan, argued, that, factors, such, as, ethnicity, language, religion, economics, geography, ruling, dynasty, and, historic, military, deeds, were, important, but, not, sufficient, needed, was, a, spiritual,

united, states, and, france, as, well, as, in, constitutional, monarchies, such, as, great, britain, belgium, and, spain, creole, nationalism, is, the, ideology, that, emerged, in, independence, movements, among, the, creoles, descendants, of, the, colonizers, especially, in, latin, america, in, the, early, 19th, century, it, was, facilitated, when, french, emperor, napoleon, seized, control, of, spain, and, portugal, breaking, the, chain, of, control, from, the, spanish, and, portuguese, kings, to, the, local, governors, allegiance, to, the, napoleonic, states, was, rejected, and, increasingly, the, creoles, demanded, independence, they, achieved, it, after, civil, wars, 1808, 1826, ethnic, nationalism, also, known, as, ethno, nationalism, is, a, form, of, nationalism, wherein, the, nation, is, defined, in, terms, of, ethnicity, the, central, theme, of, ethnic, nationalists, is, that, nations, are, defined, by, a, shared, heritage, which, usually, includes, a, common, language, a, common, faith, and, a, common, ethnic, ancestry, it, also, includes, ideas, of, a, culture, shared, between, members, of, the, group, and, with, their, ancestors, it, is, different, from, a, purely, cultural, definition, of, the, nation, which, allows, people, to, become, members, of, a, nation, by, cultural, assimilation, and, from, a, purely, linguistic, definition, according, to, which, the, nation, consists, of, all, speakers, of, a, specific, language, whereas, nationalism, in, and, of, itself, does, not, imply, a, belief, in, the, superiority, of, one, ethnicity, or, country, over, others, some, nationalists, support, ethnocentric, supremacy, or, protectionism, the, humiliation, of, being, a, second, class, citizen, led, regional, minorities, in, multiethnic, states, such, as, great, britain, spain, france, germany, russia, and, the, ottoman, empire, to, define, nationalism, in, terms, of, loyalty, to, their, minority, culture, especially, language, and, religion, forced, assimilation, was, anathema, for, the, politically, dominant, cultural, group, assimilation, was, necessary, to, minimize, disloyalty, and, treason, and, therefore, became, a, major, component, of, nationalism, a, second, factor, for, the, politically, dominant, group, was, competition, with, neighboring, states, nationalism, involved, a, rivalry, especially, in, terms, of, military, prowess, and, economic, strength, economic, nationalism, or, economic, patriotism, is, an, ideology, that, favors, state, interventionism, in, the, economy, with, policies, that, emphasize, domestic, control, of, the, economy, labor, and, capital, formation, even, if, this, requires, the, imposition, of, tariffs, and, other, restrictions, on, the, movement, of, labor, goods, and, capital, feminist, critique, interprets, nationalism, as, a, mechanism, through, which, sexual, control, and, repression, are, justified, and, legitimized, often, by, a, dominant, masculine, power, the, gendering, of, nationalism, through, socially, constructed, notions, of, masculinity, and, femininity, not, only, shapes, what, masculine, and, feminine, participation, in, the, building, of, that, nation, will, look, like, but, also, how, the, nation, will, be, imagined, by, nationalists, a, nation, having, its, own, identity, is, viewed, as, necessary, and, often, inevitable, and, these, identities, are, gendered, the, physical, land, itself, is, often, gendered, as, female, i, e, motherland, with, a, body, in, constant, danger, of, violation, by, foreign, males, while, national, pride, and, protectiveness, of, her, borders, is, gendered, as, masculine, history, political, ideologies, and, religions, place, most, nations, along, a, continuum, of, muscular, nationalism, muscular, nationalism, conceptualizes, a, nation, s, identity, as, being, derived, from, muscular, or, masculine, attributes, that, are, unique, to, a, particular, country, if, definitions, of, nationalism, and, gender, are, understood, as, socially, and, culturally, constructed, the, two, may, be, constructed, in, conjunction, by, invoking, an, us, versus, them, dichotomy, for, the, purpose, of, the, exclusion, of, the, so, called, other, who, is, used, to, reinforce, the, unifying, ties, of, the, nation, the, empowerment, of, one, gender, nation, or, sexuality, tends, to, occur, at, the, expense, and, disempowerment, of, another, in, this, way, nationalism, can, be, used, as, an, instrument, to, perpetuate, heteronormative, structures, of, power, the, gendered, manner, in, which, dominant, nationalism, has, been, imagined, in, most, states, in, the, world, has, had, important, implications, on, not, only, individual, s, lived, experience, but, on, international, relations, colonialism, has, historically, been, heavily, intertwined, with, muscular, nationalism, from, research, linking, hegemonic, masculinity, and, empire, building, to, intersectional, oppression, being, justified, by, colonialist, images, of, the, other, a, practice, integral, in, the, formation, of, western, identity, this, othering, may, come, in, the, form, of, orientalism, whereby, the, east, is, feminized, and, sexualized, by, the, west, the, imagined, feminine, east, or, other, exists, in, contrast, to, the, masculine, west, the, status, of, conquered, nations, can, become, a, causality, dilemma, the, nation, was, conquered, because, they, were, effeminate, and, seen, as, effeminate, because, they, were, conquered, in, defeat, they, are, considered, militaristically, unskilled, not, aggressive, and, thus, not, muscular, in, order, for, a, nation, to, be, considered, proper, it, must, possess, the, male, gendered, characteristics, of, virility, as, opposed, to, the, stereotypically, female, characteristics, of, subservience, and, dependency, muscular, nationalism, is, often, inseparable, from, the, concept, of, a, warrior, which, shares, ideological, commonalities, across, many, nations, they, are, defined, by, the, masculine, notions, of, aggression, willingness, to, engage, in, war, decisiveness, and, muscular, strength, as, opposed, to, the, feminine, notions, of, peacefulness, weakness, non, violence, and, compassion, this, masculinized, image, of, a, warrior, has, been, theorized, to, be, the, culmination, of, a, series, of, gendered, historical, and, social, processes, played, out, in, a, national, and, international, context, ideas, of, cultural, dualism, of, a, martial, man, and, chaste, woman, which, are, implicit, in, muscular, nationalism, underline, the, raced, classed, gendered, and, heteronormative, nature, of, dominant, national, identity, nations, and, gender, systems, are, mutually, supportive, constructions, the, nation, fulfils, the, masculine, ideals, of, comradeship, and, brotherhood, masculinity, has, been, cited, as, a, notable, factor, in, producing, political, militancy, a, common, feature, of, national, crisis, is, a, drastic, shift, in, the, socially, acceptable, ways, of, being, a, man, which, then, helps, to, shape, the, gendered, perception, of, the, nation, as, a, whole, there, are, different, types, of, nationalism, including, risorgimento, nationalism, and, integral, nationalism, whereas, risorgimento, nationalism, applies, to, a, nation, seeking, to, establish, a, liberal, state, for, example, the, risorgimento, in, italy, and, similar, movements, in, greece, germany, poland, during, the, 19th, century, or, the, civic, american, nationalism, integral, nationalism, results, after, a, nation, has, achieved, independence, and, has, established, a, state, fascist, italy, and, nazi, germany, according, to, alter, and, brown, were, examples, of, integral, nationalism, some, of, the, qualities, that, characterize, integral, nationalism, are, anti, individualism, statism, radical, extremism, and, aggressive, expansionist, militarism, the, term, integral, nationalism, often, overlaps, with, fascism, although, many, natural, points, of, disagreement, exist, integral, nationalism, arises, in, countries, where, a, strong, military, ethos, has, become, entrenched, through, the, independence, struggle, when, once, independence, is, achieved, it, is, believed, that, a, strong, military, is, required, to, ensure, the, security, and, viability, of, the, new, state, also, the, success, of, such, a, liberation, struggle, results, in, feelings, of, national, superiority, that, may, lead, to, extreme, nationalism, pan, nationalism, is, unique, in, that, it, covers, a, large, area, span, pan, nationalism, focuses, more, on, clusters, of, ethnic, groups, pan, slavism, is, one, example, of, pan, nationalism, the, goal, is, to, unite, all, slavic, people, into, one, country, they, did, succeed, by, uniting, several, south, slavic, people, into, yugoslavia, in, 1918, left, wing, nationalism, occasionally, known, as, socialist, nationalism, not, to, be, confused, with, the, german, fascist, national, socialism, is, a, political, movement, that, combines, left, wing, politics, with, nationalism, many, nationalist, movements, are, dedicated, to, national, liberation, in, the, view, that, their, nations, are, being, persecuted, by, other, nations, and, thus, need, to, exercise, self, determination, by, liberating, themselves, from, the, accused, persecutors, anti, revisionist, marxism, leninism, is, closely, tied, with, this, ideology, and, practical, examples, include, stalin, s, early, work, marxism, and, the, national, question, and, his, socialism, in, one, country, edict, which, declares, that, nationalism, can, be, used, in, an, internationalist, context, fighting, for, national, liberation, without, racial, or, religious, divisions, other, examples, of, left, wing, nationalism, include, fidel, castro, s, 26th, of, july, movement, that, launched, the, cuban, revolution, in, 1959, cornwall, s, mebyon, kernow, ireland, s, sinn, f, in, wales, s, plaid, cymru, galicia, s, galician, nationalist, bloc, the, awami, league, in, bangladesh, the, african, national, congress, in, south, africa, and, numerous, movements, in, eastern, europe, among, the, first, advocates, of, national, anarchism, were, hans, cany, peter, t, pfer, and, former, national, front, activist, troy, southgate, founder, of, the, national, revolutionary, faction, a, since, disbanded, british, based, organization, which, cultivated, links, to, certain, far, left, and, far, right, circles, in, the, united, kingdom, and, in, post, soviet, states, not, to, be, confused, with, the, national, anarchism, of, the, black, ram, group, in, the, united, kingdom, national, anarchists, worked, with, albion, awake, alternative, green, published, by, former, green, anarchist, editor, richard, hunt, and, jonathan, boulter, to, develop, the, anarchist, heretics, fair, those, national, anarchists, cite, their, influences, primarily, from, mikhail, bakunin, william, godwin, peter, kropotkin, pierre, joseph, proudhon, max, stirner, and, leo, tolstoy, a, position, developed, in, europe, during, the, 1990s, national, anarchist, groups, have, seen, arisen, worldwide, most, prominently, in, australia, new, right, australia, new, zealand, germany, international, national, anarchism, and, the, united, states, bana, national, anarchism, has, been, described, as, a, radical, right, wing, nationalist, ideology, which, advocates, racial, separatism, and, white, racial, purity, national, anarchists, claim, to, syncretize, neotribal, ethnic, nationalism, with, philosophical, anarchism, mainly, in, their, support, for, a, stateless, society, whilst, rejecting, anarchist, social, philosophy, the, main, ideological, innovation, of, national, anarchism, is, its, anti, state, palingenetic, ultranationalism, national, anarchists, advocate, homogeneous, communities, in, place, of, the, nation, state, national, anarchists, claim, that, those, of, different, ethnic, or, racial, groups, would, be, free, to, develop, separately, in, their, own, tribal, communes, while, striving, to, be, politically, meritocratic, economically, non, capitalist, ecologically, sustainable, and, socially, and, culturally, traditional, although, the, term, national, anarchism, dates, back, as, far, as, the, 1920s, the, contemporary, national, anarchist, movement, has, been, put, forward, since, the, late, 1990s, by, british, political, activist, troy, southgate, who, positions, it, as, being, beyond, left, and, right, the, few, scholars, who, have, studied, national, anarchism, conclude, that, it, represents, a, further, evolution, in, the, thinking, of, the, radical, right, rather, than, an, entirely, new, dimension, on, the, political, spectrum, national, anarchism, is, considered, by, anarchists, as, being, a, rebranding, of, totalitarian, fascism, and, an, oxymoron, due, to, the, inherent, contradiction, of, anarchist, philosophy, of, anti, fascism, abolition, of, unjustified, hierarchy, dismantling, of, national, borders, and, universal, equality, between, different, nationalities, as, being, incompatible, with, the, idea, of, a, synthesis, between, anarchism, and, fascism, national, anarchism, has, elicited, scepticism, and, outright, hostility, from, both, left, wing, and, far, right, critics, critics, including, scholars, accuse, national, anarchists, of, being, nothing, more, than, white, nationalists, who, promote, a, communitarian, and, racialist, form, of, ethnic, and, racial, separatism, while, wanting, the, militant, chic, of, calling, themselves, anarchists, without, the, historical, and, philosophical, baggage, that, accompanies, such, a, claim, including, the, anti, racist, egalitarian, anarchist, philosophy, and, the, contributions, of, jewish, anarchists, some, scholars, are, sceptical, that, implementing, national, anarchism, would, result, in, an, expansion, of, freedom, and, describe, it, as, an, authoritarian, anti, statism, that, would, result, in, authoritarianism, and, oppression, only, on, a, smaller, scale, nativist, nationalism, is, a, type, of, nationalism, similar, to, creole, or, territorial, types, of, nationalism, but, which, defines, belonging, to, a, nation, solely, by, being, born, on, its, territory, in, countries, where, strong, nativist, nationalism, exists, people, who, were, not, born, in, the, country, are, seen, as, lesser, nationals, than, those, who, were, born, there, and, are, called, immigrants, even, if, they, became, naturalized, it, is, cultural, as, people, will, never, see, a, foreign, born, person, as, one, of, them, and, is, legal, as, such, people, are, banned, for, life, from, holding, certain, jobs, especially, government, jobs, in, scholarly, studies, nativism, is, a, standard, technical, term, although, those, who, hold, this, political, view, do, not, typically, accept, the, label, ativists, do, not, consider, themselves, nativists, for, them, it, is, a, negative, term, and, they, rather, consider, themselves, as, patriots, racial, nationalism, is, an, ideology, that, advocates, a, racial, definition, of, national, identity, racial, nationalism, seeks, to, preserve, a, given, race, through, policies, such, as, banning, race, mixing, and, the, immigration, of, other, races, its, ideas, tend, to, be, in, direct, conflict, with, those, of, anti, racism, and, multiculturalism, specific, examples, are, black, nationalism, and, white, nationalism, religious, nationalism, is, the, relationship, of, nationalism, to, a, particular, religious, belief, dogma, or, affiliation, where, a, shared, religion, can, be, seen, to, contribute, to, a, sense, of, national, unity, a, common, bond, among, the, citizens, of, the, nation, saudi, arabian, iranian, egyptian, iraqi, american, and, the, pakistani, islamic, nationalism, two, nation, theory, are, some, examples, some, nationalists, exclude, certain, groups, some, nationalists, defining, the, national, community, in, ethnic, linguistic, cultural, historic, or, religious, terms, or, a, combination, of, these, may, then, seek, to, deem, certain, minorities, as, not, truly, being, a, part, of, the, national, community, as, they, define, it, sometimes, a, mythic, homeland, is, more, important, for, the, national, identity, than, the, actual, territory, occupied, by, the, nation, territorial, nationalists, assume, that, all, inhabitants, of, a, particular, nation, owe, allegiance, to, their, country, of, birth, or, adoption, a, sacred, quality, is, sought, in, the, nation, and, in, the, popular, memories, it, evokes, citizenship, is, idealized, by, territorial, nationalists, a, criterion, of, a, territorial, nationalism, is, the, establishment, of, a, mass, public, culture, based, on, common, values, codes, and, traditions, of, the, population, sport, spectacles, like, football, s, world, cup, command, worldwide, audiences, as, nations, battle, for, supremacy, and, the, fans, invest, intense, support, for, their, national, team, increasingly, people, have, tied, their, loyalties, and, even, their, cultural, identity, to, national, teams, the, globalization, of, audiences, through, television, and, other, media, has, generated, revenues, from, advertisers, and, subscribers, in, the, billions, of, dollars, as, the, fifa, scandals, of, 2015, revealed, jeff, kingston, looks, at, football, the, commonwealth, games, baseball, cricket, and, the, olympics, and, finds, that, the, capacity, of, sports, to, ignite, and, amplify, nationalist, passions, and, prejudices, is, as, extraordinary, as, is, their, power, to, console, unify, uplift, and, generate, goodwill, the, phenomenon, is, evident, across, most, of, the, world, the, british, empire, strongly, emphasized, sports, among, its, soldiers, and, agents, across, the, world, and, often, the,

harris, mylonas, and, ned, whalley, co, edited, a, special, issue, on, pandemic, nationalism, exploring, the, relationship, between, nationalism, and, the, covid, 19, pandemic, while, nationalism, unquestionably, helped, overcome, collective, action, problems, within, state, borders, during, the, pandemic, it, has, undermined, them, at, the, global, scale, the, most, clear, example, being, been, the, abject, failure, of, international, organizations, to, coordinate, an, appropriate, response, as, they, put, it, during, the, pandemic, a, nationalist, human, calculus, has, prevailed, solidarity, has, been, extended, to, co, nationals, but, has, been, less, forthcoming, beyond, that, point, all, states, have, responded, by, turning, inward, border, closures, have, been, at, the, heart, of, mitigation, efforts, from, the, very, beginning, and, lockdowns, legitimated, and, often, enforced, through, national, and, patriotic, discourses, critics, of, nationalism, have, argued, that, it, is, often, unclear, what, constitutes, a, nation, or, whether, a, nation, is, a, legitimate, unit, of, political, rule, nationalists, hold, that, the, boundaries, of, a, nation, and, a, state, should, coincide, with, one, another, thus, nationalism, tends, to, oppose, multiculturalism, and, anti, racism, it, can, also, lead, to, conflict, when, more, than, one, national, group, finds, itself, claiming, rights, to, a, particular, territory, or, seeking, to, take, control, of, the, state, philosopher, a, c, grayling, describes, nations, as, artificial, constructs, their, boundaries, drawn, in, the, blood, of, past, wars, he, argues, that, there, is, no, country, on, earth, which, is, not, home, to, more, than, one, different, but, usually, coexisting, culture, cultural, heritage, is, not, the, same, thing, as, national, identity, nationalism, is, considered, by, its, critics, to, be, inherently, divisive, as, adherents, may, draw, upon, and, highlight, perceived, differences, between, people, emphasizing, an, individual, s, identification, with, their, own, nation, they, also, consider, the, idea, to, be, potentially, oppressive, because, it, can, submerge, individual, identity, within, a, national, whole, and, give, elites, or, political, leaders, potential, opportunities, to, manipulate, or, control, the, masses, much, of, the, early, opposition, to, nationalism, was, related, to, its, geopolitical, ideal, of, a, separate, state, for, every, nation, the, classic, nationalist, movements, of, the, 19th, century, rejected, the, very, existence, of, the, multi, ethnic, empires, in, europe, contrary, to, an, ideological, critique, of, nationalism, which, developed, into, several, forms, of, internationalism, and, anti, nationalism, the, islamic, revival, of, the, 20th, century, also, produced, an, islamist, critique, of, the, nation, state, see, pan, islamism, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, marxists, and, other, socialists, and, communists, such, as, rosa, luxemburg, produced, political, analyses, that, were, critical, of, the, nationalist, movements, then, active, in, central, and, eastern, europe, although, a, variety, of, other, contemporary, socialists, and, communists, from, vladimir, lenin, a, communist, to, j, zef, pi, sudski, a, socialist, were, more, sympathetic, to, national, self, determination, in, his, classic, essay, on, the, topic, george, orwell, distinguishes, nationalism, from, patriotism, which, he, defines, as, devotion, to, a, particular, place, more, abstractly, nationalism, is, power, hunger, tempered, by, self, deception, for, orwell, the, nationalist, is, more, likely, than, not, dominated, by, irrational, negative, impulses, a, nationalist, is, one, who, thinks, solely, or, mainly, in, terms, of, competitive, prestige, he, may, be, a, positive, or, a, negative, nationalist, that, is, he, may, use, his, mental, energy, either, in, boosting, or, in, denigrating, but, at, any, rate, his, thoughts, always, turn, on, victories, defeats, triumphs, and, humiliations, he, sees, history, especially, contemporary, history, as, the, endless, rise, and, decline, of, great, power, units, and, every, event, that, happens, seems, to, him, a, demonstration, that, his, own, side, is, on, the, upgrade, and, some, hated, rival, is, on, the, downgrade, but, finally, it, is, important, not, to, confuse, nationalism, with, mere, worship, of, success, the, nationalist, does, not, go, on, the, principle, of, simply, ganging, up, with, the, strongest, side, on, the, contrary, having, picked, his, side, he, persuades, himself, that, it, is, the, strongest, and, is, able, to, stick, to, his, belief, even, when, the, facts, are, overwhelmingly, against, him, in, the, liberal, political, tradition, there, was, mostly, a, negative, attitude, toward, nationalism, as, a, dangerous, force, and, a, cause, of, conflict, and, war, between, nation, states, the, historian, lord, acton, put, the, case, for, nationalism, as, insanity, in, 1862, he, argued, that, nationalism, suppresses, minorities, places, country, above, moral, principles, and, creates, a, dangerous, individual, attachment, to, the, state, he, opposed, democracy, and, tried, to, defend, the, pope, from, italian, nationalism, since, the, late, 20th, century, liberals, have, been, increasingly, divided, with, some, philosophers, such, as, michael, walzer, isaiah, berlin, charles, taylor, and, david, miller, emphasizing, that, a, liberal, society, needs, to, be, based, in, a, stable, nation, state, the, pacifist, critique, of, nationalism, also, concentrates, on, the, violence, of, some, nationalist, movements, the, associated, militarism, and, on, conflicts, between, nations, inspired, by, jingoism, or, chauvinism, national, symbols, and, patriotic, assertiveness, are, in, some, countries, discredited, by, their, historical, link, with, past, wars, especially, in, germany, british, pacifist, bertrand, russell, criticized, nationalism, for, diminishing, the, individual, s, capacity, to, judge, his, or, her, fatherland, s, foreign, policy, albert, einstein, stated, that, nationalism, is, an, infantile, disease, it, is, the, measles, of, mankind, jiddu, krishnamurti, stated, that, nationalism, is, merely, the, glorification, of, tribalism, transhumanists, have, also, expressed, their, opposition, to, nationalism, to, the, extent, that, some, transhumanists, believe, national, identities, should, be, dissolved, entirely, the, influential, transhumanist, fm, 2030, refused, to, identify, with, any, nationality, referring, to, himself, as, universal, furthermore, in, the, transhumanist, handbook, kate, levchuk, stated, that, a, transhumanist, doesn, t, believe, in, nationality
