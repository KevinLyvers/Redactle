whaling, is, the, hunting, of, whales, for, their, usable, products, such, as, meat, and, blubber, which, can, be, turned, into, a, type, of, oil, that, was, important, in, the, industrial, revolution, whaling, was, practiced, as, an, organized, industry, as, early, as, 875, ad, by, the, 16th, century, it, had, become, the, principal, industry, in, the, basque, coastal, regions, of, spain, and, france, the, whaling, industry, spread, throughout, the, world, and, became, very, profitable, in, terms, of, trade, and, resources, some, regions, of, the, world, s, oceans, along, the, animals, migration, routes, had, a, particularly, dense, whale, population, and, became, targets, for, large, concentrations, of, whaling, ships, and, the, industry, continued, to, grow, well, into, the, 20th, century, the, depletion, of, some, whale, species, to, near, extinction, led, to, the, banning, of, whaling, in, many, countries, by, 1969, and, to, an, international, cessation, of, whaling, as, an, industry, in, the, late, 1980s, archaeological, evidence, suggests, the, earliest, known, forms, of, whaling, date, to, at, least, 3000, bc, practiced, by, the, inuit, and, other, peoples, in, the, north, atlantic, and, north, pacific, coastal, communities, around, the, world, have, long, histories, of, subsistence, use, of, cetaceans, by, dolphin, drive, hunting, and, by, harvesting, drift, whales, widespread, commercial, whaling, emerged, with, organized, fleets, of, whaling, ships, in, the, 17th, century, competitive, national, whaling, industries, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, and, the, introduction, of, factory, ships, and, explosive, harpoons, along, with, the, concept, of, whale, harvesting, in, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, by, the, late, 1930s, more, than, 50, 000, whales, were, killed, annually, in, 1982, the, international, whaling, commission, iwc, decided, that, there, should, be, a, pause, on, commercial, whaling, on, all, whale, species, from, 1986, onwards, because, of, the, extreme, depletion, of, most, of, the, whale, stocks, contemporary, whaling, for, whale, meat, is, subject, to, intense, debate, canada, iceland, japan, norway, russia, south, korea, the, united, states, and, the, danish, dependencies, of, the, faroe, islands, and, greenland, continue, to, hunt, in, the, 21st, century, countries, that, support, commercial, whaling, notably, iceland, japan, and, norway, wish, to, lift, the, iwc, moratorium, on, certain, whale, stocks, for, hunting, anti, whaling, countries, and, environmental, activists, oppose, lifting, the, ban, under, the, terms, of, the, iwc, moratorium, aboriginal, whaling, is, allowed, to, continue, on, a, subsistence, basis, over, the, past, few, decades, whale, watching, has, become, a, significant, industry, in, many, parts, of, the, world, in, some, countries, it, has, replaced, whaling, but, in, a, few, others, the, two, business, models, exist, in, an, uneasy, tension, the, live, capture, of, cetaceans, for, display, in, aquaria, e, g, captive, killer, whales, continues, whaling, began, in, prehistoric, times, in, coastal, waters, the, earliest, depictions, of, whaling, are, the, neolithic, bangudae, petroglyphs, in, korea, which, may, date, back, to, 6000, bc, these, images, are, the, earliest, evidence, for, whaling, although, prehistoric, hunting, and, gathering, is, generally, considered, to, have, had, little, ecological, impact, early, whaling, in, the, arctic, may, have, altered, freshwater, ecology, early, whaling, affected, the, development, of, widely, disparate, cultures, on, different, continents, the, basques, were, the, first, to, catch, whales, commercially, and, dominated, the, trade, for, five, centuries, spreading, to, the, far, corners, of, the, north, atlantic, and, even, reaching, the, south, atlantic, the, development, of, modern, whaling, techniques, was, spurred, in, the, 19th, century, by, the, increase, in, demand, for, whale, oil, sometimes, known, as, train, oil, and, in, the, 20th, century, by, a, demand, for, margarine, and, later, whale, meat, the, primary, species, hunted, are, minke, whales, belugas, narwhals, and, pilot, whales, which, are, some, of, the, smallest, species, of, whales, there, are, also, smaller, numbers, killed, of, gray, whales, sei, whales, fin, whales, bowhead, whales, bryde, s, whales, sperm, whales, and, humpback, whales, recent, scientific, surveys, estimate, a, population, of, 103, 000, minkes, in, the, northeast, atlantic, with, respect, to, the, populations, of, antarctic, minke, whales, as, of, january, 2010, the, iwc, states, that, it, is, unable, to, provide, reliable, estimates, at, the, present, time, and, that, a, major, review, is, underway, by, the, scientific, committee, whale, oil, is, used, little, today, and, modern, whaling, is, primarily, done, for, food, for, pets, fur, farms, sled, dogs, and, humans, and, for, making, carvings, of, tusks, teeth, and, vertebrae, both, meat, and, blubber, muktuk, are, eaten, from, narwhals, belugas, and, bowheads, from, commercially, hunted, minkes, meat, is, eaten, by, humans, or, animals, and, blubber, is, rendered, down, mostly, to, cheap, industrial, products, such, as, animal, feed, or, in, iceland, as, a, fuel, supplement, for, whaling, ships, international, cooperation, on, whaling, regulation, began, in, 1931, and, culminated, in, the, signing, of, the, international, convention, for, the, regulation, of, whaling, icrw, in, 1946, its, aim, is, to, provide, for, the, proper, conservation, of, whale, stocks, and, thus, make, possible, the, orderly, development, of, the, whaling, industry, the, international, whaling, commission, iwc, was, set, up, under, the, icrw, to, decide, hunting, quotas, and, other, relevant, matters, based, on, the, findings, of, its, scientific, committee, non, member, countries, are, not, bound, by, its, regulations, and, conduct, their, own, management, programs, it, regulates, hunting, of, 13, species, of, great, whales, and, has, not, reached, consensus, on, whether, it, may, regulate, smaller, species, the, iwc, voted, on, july, 23, 1982, to, establish, a, moratorium, on, commercial, whaling, of, great, whales, beginning, in, the, 1985, 86, season, since, 1992, the, iwc, s, scientific, committee, has, requested, that, it, be, allowed, to, give, quota, proposals, for, some, whale, stocks, but, this, has, so, far, been, refused, by, the, plenary, committee, at, the, 2010, meeting, in, morocco, representatives, of, the, 88, member, states, discussed, whether, to, lift, the, 24, year, ban, on, commercial, whaling, japan, norway, and, iceland, urged, the, organisation, to, lift, the, ban, a, coalition, of, anti, whaling, nations, offered, a, compromise, plan, that, would, allow, these, countries, to, continue, whaling, but, with, smaller, catches, and, under, close, supervision, their, plan, would, also, completely, ban, whaling, in, the, southern, ocean, more, than, 200, scientists, and, experts, have, opposed, the, compromise, proposal, for, lifting, the, ban, and, have, also, opposed, allowing, whaling, in, the, southern, ocean, which, was, declared, a, whale, sanctuary, in, 1994, opponents, of, the, compromise, plan, want, to, see, an, end, to, all, commercial, whaling, but, are, willing, to, allow, subsistence, level, catches, by, indigenous, peoples, these, totals, include, great, whales, counts, from, iwc, and, wdc, and, iwc, summary, catch, database, version, 6, 1, july, 2016, the, iwc, database, is, supplemented, by, faroese, catches, of, pilot, whales, greenland, s, and, canada, s, catches, of, narwhals, data, 1954, 2014, belugas, from, multiple, sources, shown, in, the, beluga, whale, article, indonesia, s, catches, of, sperm, whales, and, bycatch, in, korea, most, of, the, whale, species, in, the, table, are, not, considered, endangered, by, the, iucn, least, concern, or, data, deficient, only, the, sei, whale, is, classified, as, endangered, and, the, fin, whale, is, classified, as, vulnerable, by, the, iucn, key, elements, of, the, debate, over, whaling, include, sustainability, ownership, national, sovereignty, cetacean, intelligence, suffering, during, hunting, health, risks, the, value, of, lethal, sampling, to, establish, catch, quotas, the, value, of, controlling, whales, impact, on, fish, stocks, and, the, rapidly, approaching, extinction, of, a, few, whale, species, the, world, wide, fund, for, nature, says, that, 90, of, all, northern, right, whales, killed, by, human, activities, are, from, ship, collisions, calling, for, restrictions, on, the, movement, of, shipping, in, certain, areas, noise, pollution, threatens, the, existence, of, cetaceans, large, ships, and, boats, make, a, tremendous, amount, of, noise, that, falls, into, the, same, frequency, range, of, many, whales, bycatch, also, kills, more, animals, than, hunting, some, scientists, believe, pollution, to, be, a, factor, moreover, since, the, iwc, moratorium, there, have, been, several, instances, of, illegal, whale, hunting, by, iwc, nations, in, 1994, the, iwc, reported, evidence, from, genetic, testing, of, whale, meat, and, blubber, for, sale, on, the, open, market, in, japan, in, 1993, in, addition, to, the, legally, permitted, minke, whale, the, analyses, showed, that, 10, 25, of, tissues, sampled, came, from, non, minke, baleen, whales, further, research, in, 1995, and, 1996, showed, a, significant, drop, of, non, minke, baleen, whales, sampled, to, 2, 5, in, a, separate, paper, baker, stated, that, many, of, these, animals, certainly, represent, a, bycatch, incidental, entrapment, in, fishing, gear, and, stated, that, dna, monitoring, of, whale, meat, is, required, to, adequately, track, whale, products, it, was, revealed, in, 1994, that, the, soviet, union, had, been, systematically, undercounting, its, catch, for, example, from, 1948, to, 1973, the, soviet, union, caught, 48, 477, humpback, whales, rather, than, the, 2, 710, it, officially, reported, to, the, iwc, on, the, basis, of, this, new, information, the, iwc, stated, that, it, would, have, to, rewrite, its, catch, figures, for, the, last, 40, years, according, to, ray, gambell, then, secretary, of, the, iwc, the, organization, had, raised, its, suspicions, with, the, former, soviet, union, but, it, did, not, take, further, action, because, it, could, not, interfere, with, national, sovereignty, whales, are, long, lived, predators, so, their, tissues, build, up, concentrations, of, methylmercury, from, their, prey, mercury, concentrations, reach, levels, that, are, hazardous, to, humans, who, consume, too, much, too, often, since, mercury, also, bioaccumulates, in, humans, high, levels, have, been, found, in, the, caribbean, where, people, are, advised, not, to, exceed, one, serving, every, three, weeks, in, the, faroe, islands, and, in, japan, scientists, have, analyzed, the, ability, of, the, oceans, to, sequester, atmospheric, carbon, before, industrial, whaling, and, in, modern, times, hundreds, of, years, after, the, most, active, whaling, periods, focusing, on, the, amount, of, carbon, stored, in, baleen, whales, scientists, determined, that, large, marine, mammals, hold, over, 9, million, less, tons, of, carbon, in, the, ocean, than, during, the, pre, whaling, era, 9, 1, x, 10, 6, tons, whales, play, an, important, role, in, the, carbon, cycle, in, life, and, death, living, whales, cycle, carbon, and, nitrogen, through, throughout, the, water, column, via, whale, feces, where, it, can, contribute, to, primary, productivity, at, the, surface, in, death, their, carcasses, can, become, part, of, a, whale, fall, and, sink, to, the, bottom, bringing, their, carbon, with, them, to, help, form, a, temporary, ecosystem, at, the, ocean, floor, despite, rebounding, whale, numbers, after, the, international, ban, on, whaling, climate, change, and, rising, carbon, levels, continue, to, hinder, the, amount, of, carbon, sequestered, by, whales, whaling, was, a, major, maritime, industry, in, australia, from, 1791, until, its, final, cessation, in, 1978, at, least, 45, whaling, stations, operated, in, tasmania, during, the, 19th, century, and, bay, whaling, was, conducted, out, of, other, mainland, centres, modern, whaling, using, harpoon, guns, and, iron, hulled, catchers, was, conducted, in, the, 20th, century, from, shore, based, stations, in, western, australia, south, australia, new, south, wales, and, queensland, also, in, norfolk, island, overfishing, saw, the, closure, of, some, whaling, stations, before, a, government, ban, on, the, industry, was, introduced, in, 1978, after, a, major, campaign, by, conservationists, canadians, kill, about, 600, narwhals, per, year, they, kill, 100, belugas, per, year, in, the, beaufort, sea, 300, in, northern, quebec, nunavik, and, an, unknown, number, in, nunavut, the, total, annual, kill, in, beaufort, and, quebec, areas, varies, between, 300, and, 400, belugas, per, year, numbers, are, not, available, for, nunavut, since, 2003, when, the, arviat, area, with, about, half, nunavut, s, hunters, killed, 200, 300, belugas, though, the, authors, say, hunters, resist, giving, complete, numbers, harvested, meat, is, sold, through, shops, and, supermarkets, in, northern, communities, where, whale, meat, is, a, component, of, the, traditional, diet, hunters, in, hudson, bay, rarely, eat, beluga, meat, they, give, a, little, to, dogs, and, leave, the, rest, for, wild, animals, other, areas, may, dry, the, meat, for, later, consumption, by, humans, an, average, of, one, or, two, vertebrae, and, one, or, two, teeth, per, beluga, or, narwhal, are, carved, and, sold, one, estimate, of, the, annual, gross, value, received, from, beluga, hunts, in, hudson, bay, in, 2013, was, ca, 600, 000, for, 190, belugas, or, ca, 3, 000, per, beluga, and, ca, 530, 000, for, 81, narwhals, or, ca, 6, 500, per, narwhal, however, the, net, income, after, subtracting, costs, in, time, and, equipment, was, a, loss, of, ca, 60, per, person, for, belugas, and, ca, 7, per, person, for, narwhals, hunts, receive, subsidies, but, they, continue, as, a, tradition, rather, than, for, the, money, and, the, economic, analysis, noted, that, whale, watching, may, be, an, alternate, revenue, source, of, the, gross, income, ca, 550, 000, was, for, beluga, skin, and, meat, to, replace, beef, pork, and, chickens, which, would, otherwise, be, bought, ca, 50, 000, was, received, for, carved, vertebrae, and, teeth, ca, 370, 000, was, for, narwhal, skin, and, meat, ca, 150, 000, was, received, for, tusks, and, carved, vertebrae, and, teeth, of, males, and, ca, 10, 000, was, received, for, carved, vertebrae, and, teeth, of, female, narwhals, the, whale, and, dolphin, conservation, says, canada, has, pursued, a, policy, of, marine, mammal, management, which, appears, to, be, more, to, do, with, political, expediency, rather, than, conservation, canada, left, the, iwc, in, 1982, and, the, only, iwc, regulated, species, currently, harvested, by, the, canadian, inuit, is, the, bowhead, whale, as, of, 2004, the, limit, on, bowhead, whale, hunting, allows, for, the, hunt, of, one, whale, every, two, years, from, the, hudson, bay, foxe, basin, population, and, one, whale, every, 13, years, from, the, baffin, bay, davis, strait, population, the, traditional, whale, hunt, known, as, grindadr, p, is, regulated, by, faroese, authorities, but, not, by, the, iwc, which, does, not, claim, jurisdiction, over, small, cetaceans, around, 800, long, finned, pilot, whales, globicephala, melaena, are, caught, each, year, mainly, during, the, summer, other, species, are, not, hunted, though, occasionally, atlantic, white, sided, dolphin, can, be, found, among, the, pilot, whales, most, faroese, consider, the, hunt, an, important, part, of, their, culture, and, history, and, arguments, about, the, topic, raise, strong, emotions, animal, rights, groups, criticize, the, hunt, as, being, cruel, and, unnecessary, and, economically, insignificant, hunters, claim, that, most, journalists, lack, knowledge, of, the, catch, methods, used, to, capture, and, kill, the, whales, the, inuit, mastered, the, art, of, whaling, around, the, 11, century, ad, in, the, bering, strait, the, technique, consisted, of, spearing, a, whale, with, a, spear, connected, to, an, inflated, seal, bladder, the, bladder, would, float, and, exhaust, the, whale, when, diving, and, when, it, surfaced, the, inuit, hunters, would, spear, it, again, further, exhausting, the, animal, until, they, were, able, to, kill, it, vikings, in, greenland, also, ate, whale, meat, but, archaeologists, believe, they, never, hunted, them, on, the, sea, greenlandic, inuit, whalers, catch, around, 175, large, whales, per, year, mostly, minke, whales, as, well, as, 360, narwhals, 200, belugas, 190, pilot, whales, and, 2, 300, porpoises, the, government, of, greenland, sets, limits, for, narwhals, and, belugas, there, are, no, limits, on, pilot, whales, and, porpoises, the, iwc, treats, the, west, and, east, coasts, of, greenland, as, two, separate, population, areas, and, sets, separate, quotas, for, each, coast, the, far, more, densely, populated, west, coast, accounts, for, over, 90, of, the, catch, the, average, per, year, from, 2012, to, 2016, was, around, 150, minke, and, 17, fin, whales, and, humpback, whales, taken, from, west, coast, waters, and, around, 10, minke, from, east, coast, waters, in, april, 2009, greenland, landed, its, first, bowhead, whale, in, nearly, 40, years, it, landed, three, bowheads, each, year, in, 2009, and, 2010, one, each, in, 2011, and, 2015, in, 2021, the, sermersooq, municipal, council, banned, whaling, in, nuup, kangerlua, one, of, the, largest, fjords, in, inhabited, areas, of, greenland, the, council, did, not, want, hunting, to, kill, the, humpback, whales, seen, by, the, local, tourism, industry, before, local, humpback, hunting, resumed, in, 2010, there, had, been, nine, humpbacks, in, the, fjord, during, summer, when, hunting, resumed, some, were, killed, and, others, left, sermersooq, has, not, banned, whaling, elsewhere, in, the, municipality, which, is, the, world, s, largest, municipality, at, 200, 000, square, miles, on, both, coasts, originally, one, of, the, most, successful, whaling, nations, german, whaling, vessels, started, from, hamburg, and, other, smaller, cities, on, the, elbe, river, hunting, for, whales, around, greenland, and, spitsbergen, while, 1770, is, recorded, to, have, been, the, most, successful, year, of, german, whaling, german, whaling, went, into, steep, decline, with, the, beginning, of, the, napoleonic, wars, and, never, really, recovered, after, the, napoleonic, wars, germany, tried, but, could, never, re, establish, a, successful, whaling, industry, german, whaling, ships, in, the, mid, to, late, 19th, century, would, generally, not, be, staffed, with, experienced, sailors, but, rather, with, members, of, more, wealthy, farming, communities, going, for, short, trips, to, scandinavia, during, the, end, of, spring, and, beginning, of, summer, when, their, labor, was, not, required, on, the, fields, this, kind, of, whaling, was, ineffective, many, journeys, would, not, lead, to, any, whales, caught, instead, seal, and, polar, bear, skins, were, brought, back, to, shore, communities, often, paid, more, for, equipping, the, vessels, in, the, first, place, than, making, money, with, the, goods, brought, back, to, shore, today, local, historians, believe, that, german, whaling, in, the, late, 19th, century, was, more, a, rite, of, passage, for, the, sons, of, wealthy, farmers, from, northern, german, islands, than, an, action, undertaken, for, true, commercial, reason, german, whaling, was, abandoned, in, 1872, prior, to, the, first, world, war, the, newly, established, german, empire, attempted, to, re, establish, large, scale, german, whaling, this, was, undertaken, with, ships, either, going, from, germany, to, iceland, or, from, the, newly, established, german, colonies, to, african, waters, these, attempts, never, were, commercially, successful, and, quickly, given, up, only, in, the, 1930s, could, germany, with, mainly, norwegian, personnel, re, establish, a, large, and, successful, whaling, industry, more, than, 15, 000, whales, were, caught, between, 1930, and, 1939, with, the, beginning, of, the, second, world, war, german, whaling, was, abandoned, completely, in, the, early, 1950s, germany, maintained, one, whaling, vessel, for, testing, purpose, as, it, considered, re, establishing, a, german, whaling, fleet, but, abandoned, these, plans, in, 1956, the, last, remaining, german, whalers, worked, for, dutch, vessels, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, iceland, is, one, of, a, handful, of, countries, which, still, host, a, privately, owned, whaling, fleet, one, company, hvalur, hf, concentrates, on, hunting, fin, whales, largely, for, export, to, japan, while, the, only, other, one, hunts, minke, whales, for, domestic, consumption, as, the, meat, is, popular, with, tourists, iceland, has, its, own, whale, watching, sector, which, exists, in, uneasy, tension, with, the, whaling, industry, iceland, did, not, object, to, the, 1986, iwc, moratorium, between, 1986, and, 1989, around, 60, animals, per, year, were, taken, under, a, scientific, permit, however, under, strong, pressure, from, anti, whaling, countries, who, viewed, scientific, whaling, as, a, circumvention, of, the, moratorium, iceland, ceased, whaling, in, 1989, following, the, iwc, s, 1991, refusal, to, accept, its, scientific, committee, s, recommendation, to, allow, sustainable, commercial, whaling, iceland, left, the, iwc, in, 1992, iceland, rejoined, the, iwc, in, 2002, with, a, reservation, to, the, moratorium, iceland, presented, a, feasibility, study, to, the, 2003, iwc, meeting, for, catches, in, 2003, and, 2004, the, primary, aim, of, the, study, was, to, deepen, the, understanding, of, fish, whale, interactions, amid, disagreement, within, the, iwc, scientific, committee, about, the, value, of, the, research, and, its, relevance, to, iwc, objectives, no, decision, on, the, proposal, was, reached, however, under, the, terms, of, the, convention, the, icelandic, government, issued, permits, for, a, scientific, catch, in, 2003, iceland, resumed, scientific, whaling, which, continued, in, 2004, and, 2005, iceland, resumed, commercial, whaling, in, 2006, its, annual, quota, was, 30, minke, whales, out, of, an, estimated, 174, 000, animals, in, the, central, and, north, eastern, north, atlantic, and, nine, fin, whales, out, of, an, estimated, 30, 000, animals, in, the, central, and, north, eastern, north, atlantic, for, the, 2012, commercial, whaling, season, starting, in, april, and, lasting, six, months, the, quota, was, set, to, 216, minke, whales, of, which, 52, were, caught, iceland, did, not, hunt, any, whales, in, 2019, and, it, is, reported, that, demand, for, whale, meat, decreased, in, that, year, lamalera, on, the, south, coast, of, the, island, of, lembata, and, lamakera, on, neighbouring, solor, are, the, two, remaining, indonesian, whaling, communities, the, hunters, obey, religious, taboos, that, ensure, that, they, use, every, part, of, the, animal, about, half, of, the, catch, is, kept, in, the, village, the, rest, is, bartered, in, local, markets, in, 1973, the, united, nations, s, food, and, agriculture, organization, fao, sent, a, whaling, ship, and, a, norwegian, whaler, to, modernize, their, hunt, this, effort, lasted, three, years, and, was, not, successful, according, to, the, fao, report, the, lamalerans, have, evolved, a, method, of, whaling, which, suits, their, natural, resources, cultural, tenets, and, style, lamalerans, say, they, returned, the, ship, because, they, immediately, caught, five, sperm, whales, too, many, to, butcher, and,

hunt, for, several, species, of, whales, but, catching, sperm, whales, are, preferable, while, other, whales, such, as, baleen, whales, are, considered, taboo, to, hunt, they, caught, five, sperm, whales, in, 1973, they, averaged, about, 40, per, year, from, the, 1960s, through, the, mid, 1990s, 13, total, from, 2002, to, 2006, 39, in, 2007, an, average, of, 20, per, year, 2008, through, 2014, and, caught, 3, in, 2015, traditional, lamaleran, whaling, used, wooden, fishing, boats, built, by, a, group, of, local, craftsmen, clan, called, ata, mol, and, the, fishermen, will, mourn, the, death, of, their, ships, for, two, months, these, days, the, lamalerans, use, a, motor, engine, to, power, their, boats, however, their, tradition, dictates, that, once, a, whale, has, been, caught, fishermen, will, have, to, row, their, boats, and, the, whale, back, to, the, shore, the, traditional, practices, made, whaling, a, dangerous, hunt, in, one, case, a, boat, was, pulled, approximately, 120, km, away, towards, timor, see, nantucket, sleighride, while, in, another, case, the, hunted, whale, capsized, the, boat, and, forced, the, fishermen, to, swim, for, 12, hours, back, to, the, shore, when, the, commercial, whaling, moratorium, was, introduced, by, the, iwc, in, 1982, japan, lodged, an, official, objection, however, in, response, to, us, threats, to, cut, japan, s, fishing, quota, in, us, territorial, waters, under, the, terms, of, the, packwood, magnuson, amendment, japan, withdrew, its, objection, in, 1987, according, to, the, bbc, the, us, went, back, on, this, promise, effectively, destroying, the, deal, since, japan, could, not, resume, commercial, whaling, it, began, whaling, on, a, purported, scientific, research, basis, australia, greenpeace, the, australian, marine, conservation, society, sea, shepherd, conservation, society, and, other, groups, dispute, the, japanese, claim, of, research, as, a, disguise, for, commercial, whaling, which, is, banned, the, sea, shepherd, conservation, society, has, attempted, to, disrupt, japanese, whaling, in, the, antarctic, since, 2003, but, eventually, ceased, this, activity, in, 2017, due, to, little, achievement, in, creating, change, other, ngos, such, as, the, australian, marine, conservation, society, and, humane, society, international, continued, to, campaign, against, japan, s, scientific, whaling, program, and, block, votes, at, iwc, to, bring, back, commercial, whaling, the, stated, purpose, of, the, research, program, is, to, establish, the, size, and, dynamics, of, whale, populations, the, japanese, government, wishes, to, resume, whaling, in, a, sustainable, manner, under, the, oversight, of, the, iwc, both, for, whale, products, meat, etc, and, to, help, preserve, fishing, resources, by, culling, whales, anti, whaling, organizations, claim, that, the, research, program, is, a, front, for, commercial, whaling, that, the, sample, size, is, needlessly, large, and, that, equivalent, information, can, be, obtained, by, non, lethal, means, for, example, by, studying, samples, of, whale, tissue, such, as, skin, or, feces, the, japanese, government, sponsored, institute, of, cetacean, research, icr, which, conducts, the, research, disagrees, stating, that, the, information, obtainable, from, tissue, and, or, feces, samples, is, insufficient, and, that, the, sample, size, is, necessary, in, order, to, be, representative, japan, s, scientific, whaling, program, is, controversial, in, anti, whaling, countries, countries, opposed, to, whaling, have, passed, non, binding, resolutions, in, the, iwc, urging, japan, to, stop, the, program, japan, claims, that, whale, stocks, for, some, species, are, sufficiently, large, to, sustain, commercial, hunting, and, blame, filibustering, by, the, anti, whaling, side, for, the, continuation, of, scientific, whaling, deputy, whaling, commissioner, joji, morishita, told, bbc, news, the, reason, for, the, moratorium, was, scientific, uncertainty, about, the, number, of, whales, it, was, a, moratorium, for, the, sake, of, collecting, data, and, that, is, why, we, started, scientific, whaling, we, were, asked, to, collect, more, data, this, collusive, relationship, between, the, whaling, industry, and, the, japanese, government, is, sometimes, criticized, by, pro, whaling, activists, who, support, local, small, scale, coastal, whaling, such, as, the, taiji, dolphin, drive, hunt, in, september, 2018, japan, chaired, the, 67th, iwc, meeting, in, brazil, and, attempted, to, pass, a, motion, to, lift, the, moratorium, on, commercial, whaling, japan, did, not, receive, enough, votes, and, the, iwc, rejected, the, motion, subsequently, on, 26, december, 2018, japan, announced, that, it, would, withdraw, its, membership, from, the, iwc, because, in, its, opinion, the, iwc, had, failed, its, duty, to, promote, sustainable, hunting, as, the, culture, within, the, iwc, moved, towards, an, anti, whaling, pro, conservation, agenda, japanese, officials, also, announced, they, will, resume, commercial, hunting, within, its, territorial, waters, and, its, 200, mile, exclusive, economic, zones, starting, in, july, 2019, but, it, will, cease, whaling, activities, in, the, antarctic, ocean, the, northwest, pacific, ocean, and, the, australian, whale, sanctuary, in, 2019, the, australian, marine, conservation, society, and, international, fund, for, animal, welfare, commissioned, legal, opinion, which, concluded, that, japan, s, commercial, whaling, program, within, its, territorial, waters, breaks, international, convention, and, law, and, that, japan, makes, itself, vulnerable, to, potential, international, legal, action, norway, registered, an, objection, to, the, international, whaling, commission, moratorium, and, is, thus, not, bound, by, it, commercial, whaling, ceased, for, a, five, year, period, to, allow, a, small, scientific, catch, for, gauging, the, stock, s, sustainability, whaling, subsequently, resumed, in, 1993, minke, whales, are, the, only, legally, hunted, species, catches, have, fluctuated, between, 487, animals, in, 2000, to, 592, in, 2007, for, the, year, 2011, the, quota, is, set, at, 1, 286, minke, whales, the, catch, is, made, solely, from, the, northeast, atlantic, minke, whale, population, which, is, estimated, at, 102, 000, whaling, in, the, philippines, has, been, illegal, since, 1997, since, the, fisheries, administrative, order, 185, of, 1991, was, amended, the, order, initially, only, made, illegal, the, catching, selling, or, transporting, of, dolphins, but, the, 1997, amendment, widened, the, scope, of, the, ban, to, include, all, cetaceans, including, whales, the, calls, for, ban, on, whaling, and, dolphin, hunting, in, the, philippines, were, raised, by, both, domestic, and, international, groups, after, local, whaling, and, dolphin, hunting, traditions, of, residents, of, pamilacan, in, bohol, were, featured, in, newspapers, in, the, 1990s, as, compromise, for, residents, of, pamilacan, who, were, dependent, on, whaling, and, dolphin, hunting, whale, and, dolphin, watching, is, being, promoted, in, the, island, as, a, source, of, tourism, income, despite, the, ban, it, is, believed, that, the, whaling, industry, in, the, philippines, did, not, cease, to, exist, but, went, underground, ussr, had, a, significant, whaling, hunt, of, orcas, and, dolphins, along, with, iceland, and, japan, the, soviet, union, s, harvest, of, over, 534, 000, whales, between, the, 1930s, and, the, 1980s, has, been, called, one, of, the, most, senseless, environmental, crimes, of, the, 20th, century, by, charles, homans, of, the, pacific, standard, in, 1970, a, study, published, by, bigg, m, a, following, photographic, recognition, of, orcas, found, a, significant, difference, in, the, suspected, ages, of, whale, populations, and, their, actual, ages, following, this, evidence, the, soviet, union, and, then, russia, continued, a, scientific, whale, hunt, though, the, verisimilitude, of, the, intentions, of, the, hunt, over, the, last, 40, years, are, questioned, the, soviet, union, s, intensive, illegal, whaling, program, from, 1948, to, 1973, was, controlled, and, managed, by, the, central, government, in, soviet, society, whaling, was, perceived, to, be, a, glamorous, and, well, paid, job, whalers, were, esteemed, as, well, traveled, adventurers, and, their, return, to, land, was, often, celebrated, elaborately, such, as, with, fanfare, and, parades, in, regard, to, economics, the, soviet, union, transformed, from, a, rural, economy, into, an, industrial, giant, by, disregarding, the, sustainability, of, a, resource, to, fill, high, production, targets, the, government, had, controlled, all, industries, including, fisheries, and, whaling, was, not, constrained, by, the, need, for, sustainability, through, profits, managers, and, workers, production, was, incentivized, with, salary, bonuses, of, 25, 60, and, various, other, benefits, awards, and, privileges, many, industries, whaling, included, became, a, manic, numbers, game, currently, the, indigenous, chukchi,

during, iwc, discussions, in, panama, south, korea, said, it, would, undertake, scientific, whaling, as, allowed, despite, the, global, moratorium, on, whaling, south, korea, s, envoy, to, the, summit, kang, joon, suk, said, that, consumption, of, whale, meat, dates, back, to, historical, times, and, that, there, had, been, an, increase, in, the, minke, whale, population, since, the, ban, took, place, in, 1986, legal, whaling, has, been, strictly, banned, and, subject, to, strong, punishments, though, the, 26, years, have, been, painful, and, frustrating, for, the, people, who, have, been, traditionally, taking, whales, for, food, he, said, that, south, korea, would, undertake, whaling, in, its, own, waters, new, zealand, s, commissioner, gerard, van, bohemen, accused, south, korea, of, putting, the, whale, population, at, risk, he, also, cited, japan, as, having, not, contributed, to, science, for, several, years, despite, undertaking, scientific, whaling, new, zealand, s, stated, position, may, be, seen, by, its, media, as, less, solid, than, australia, s, on, the, matter, given, that, its, indigenous, people, are, pushing, forward, with, plans, unopposed, by, the, government, to, recommence, whaling, there, the, people, of, ulsan, have, also, traditionally, and, contemporarily, eaten, whale, meat, south, korea, s, representative, at, the, iwc, said, that, this, is, not, a, forum, for, moral, debate, this, is, a, forum, for, legal, debate, as, a, responsible, member, of, the, commission, we, do, not, accept, any, such, categorical, absolute, proposition, that, whales, should, not, be, killed, or, caught, the, sale, and, purchase, of, whale, meat, is, allowed, if, an, official, certificate, is, issued, for, bycatch, where, whales, die, when, they, are,

ae, argued, the, policy, of, allowing, sale, of, whales, caught, incidentally, may, be, encouraging, illegal, whaling, commercial, whaling, in, britain, began, late, in, the, 16th, century, and, continued, after, the, 1801, formation, of, the, united, kingdom, and, intermittently, until, the, middle, of, the, 20th, century, the, trade, was, broadly, divided, into, two, branches, the, northern, fishery, involved, hunting, the, bowhead, whale, off, the, coast, of, greenland, and, adjacent, islands, the, southern, fishery, was, activity, anywhere, else, including, in, the, atlantic,

went, on, to, become, a, profitable, national, enterprise, and, a, source, of, skilled, mariners, for, the, royal, navy, in, times, of, war, in, the, united, states, beluga, whaling, is, widely, carried, out, catching, about, 300, belugas, per, year, monitored, by, the, alaska, beluga, whale, committee, the, annual, catch, ranges, between, 250, and, 600, per, year, subsistence, hunting, of, the, bowhead, whale, is, carried, out, by, nine, different, indigenous, alaskan, communities, and, is, managed, by, the, alaska, eskimo, whaling, commission, which, reports, to, the, national, oceanic, and, atmospheric, administration, the, hunt, takes, around, 50, bowhead, whales, a, year, from, a, population, of, about, 10, 500, in, alaskan, waters, conservationists, fear, this, hunt, is, not, sustainable, though, the, iwc, scientific, committee, the, same, group, that, provided, the, above, population, estimate, projects, a, population, growth, of, 3, 2, per, year, bowhead, whales, weigh, approximately, 5, 10, times, as, much, as, minke, whales, the, hunt, also, took, an, average, of, one, or, two, gray, whales, each, year, until, 1996, the, quota, was, reduced, to, zero, in, that, year, due, to, sustainability, concerns, a, future, review, may, result, in, the, gray, whale, hunt, being, resumed, the, makah, tribe, in, washington, state, also, reinstated, whaling, in, 1999, despite, protests, from, animal, rights, groups, they, are, currently, seeking, to, resume, whaling, of, the, gray, whale, a, right, recognized, in, the, treaty, of, neah, bay, within, limits,
