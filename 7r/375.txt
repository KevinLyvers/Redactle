sino, tibetan, also, cited, as, trans, himalayan, in, a, few, sources, is, a, family, of, more, than, 400, languages, second, only, to, indo, european, in, number, of, native, speakers, around, 1, 4, billion, people, speak, a, sino, tibetan, language, the, vast, majority, of, these, are, the, 1, 3, billion, native, speakers, of, sinitic, languages, other, sino, tibetan, languages, with, large, numbers, of, speakers, include, burmese, 33, million, and, the, tibetic, languages, 6, million, the, four, un, member, states, china, singapore, myanmar, and, bhutan, have, a, sino, tibetan, language, as, their, main, native, language, other, languages, of, the, family, are, spoken, in, the, himalayas, the, southeast, asian, massif, and, the, eastern, edge, of, the, tibetan, plateau, most, of, these, have, small, speech, communities, in, remote, mountain, areas, and, as, such, are, poorly, documented, several, low, level, subgroups, have, been, securely, reconstructed, but, reconstruction, of, a, proto, language, for, the, family, as, a, whole, is, still, at, an, early, stage, so, the, higher, level, structure, of, sino, tibetan, remains, unclear, although, the, family, is, traditionally, presented, as, divided, into, sinitic, i, e, chinese, languages, and, tibeto, burman, branches, a, common, origin, of, the, non, sinitic, languages, has, never, been, demonstrated, the, kra, dai, and, hmong, mien, languages, are, generally, included, within, sino, tibetan, by, chinese, linguists, but, have, been, excluded, by, the, international, community, since, the, 1940s, several, links, to, other, language, families, have, been, proposed, but, none, have, broad, acceptance, a, genetic, relationship, between, chinese, tibetan, burmese, and, other, languages, was, first, proposed, in, the, early, 19th, century, and, is, now, broadly, accepted, the, initial, focus, on, languages, of, civilizations, with, long, literary, traditions, has, been, broadened, to, include, less, widely, spoken, languages, some, of, which, have, only, recently, or, never, been, written, however, the, reconstruction, of, the, family, is, much, less, developed, than, for, families, such, as, indo, european, or, austroasiatic, difficulties, have, included, the, great, diversity, of, the, languages, the, lack, of, inflection, in, many, of, them, and, the, effects, of, language, contact, in, addition, many, of, the, smaller, languages, are, spoken, in, mountainous, areas, that, are, difficult, to, reach, and, are, often, also, sensitive, border, zones, there, is, no, consensus, regarding, the, date, and, location, of, their, origin, during, the, 18th, century, several, scholars, noticed, parallels, between, tibetan, and, burmese, both, languages, with, extensive, literary, traditions, early, in, the, following, century, brian, houghton, hodgson, and, others, noted, that, many, non, literary, languages, of, the, highlands, of, northeast, india, and, southeast, asia, were, also, related, to, these, the, name, tibeto, burman, was, first, applied, to, this, group, in, 1856, by, james, richardson, logan, who, added, karen, in, 1858, the, third, volume, of, the, linguistic, survey, of, india, edited, by, sten, konow, was, devoted, to, the, tibeto, burman, languages, of, british, india, studies, of, the, indo, chinese, languages, of, southeast, asia, from, the, mid, 19th, century, by, logan, and, others, revealed, that, they, comprised, four, families, tibeto, burman, tai, mon, khmer, and, malayo, polynesian, julius, klaproth, had, noted, in, 1823, that, burmese, tibetan, and, chinese, all, shared, common, basic, vocabulary, but, that, thai, mon, and, vietnamese, were, quite, different, ernst, kuhn, envisaged, a, group, with, two, branches, chinese, siamese, and, tibeto, burman, august, conrady, called, this, group, indo, chinese, in, his, influential, 1896, classification, though, he, had, doubts, about, karen, conrady, s, terminology, was, widely, used, but, there, was, uncertainty, regarding, his, exclusion, of, vietnamese, franz, nikolaus, finck, in, 1909, placed, karen, as, a, third, branch, of, chinese, siamese, jean, przyluski, introduced, the, french, term, sino, tib, tain, as, the, title, of, his, chapter, on, the, group, in, meillet, and, cohen, s, les, langues, du, monde, in, 1924, he, divided, them, into, three, groups, tibeto, burman, chinese, and, tai, and, was, uncertain, about, the, affinity, of, karen, and, hmong, mien, the, english, translation, sino, tibetan, first, appeared, in, a, short, note, by, przyluski, and, luce, in, 1931, in, 1935, the, anthropologist, alfred, kroeber, started, the, sino, tibetan, philology, project, funded, by, the, works, project, administration, and, based, at, the, university, of, california, berkeley, the, project, was, supervised, by, robert, shafer, until, late, 1938, and, then, by, paul, k, benedict, under, their, direction, the, staff, of, 30, non, linguists, collated, all, the, available, documentation, of, sino, tibetan, languages, the, result, was, eight, copies, of, a, 15, volume, typescript, entitled, sino, tibetan, linguistics, this, work, was, never, published, but, furnished, the, data, for, a, series, of, papers, by, shafer, as, well, as, shafer, s, five, volume, introduction, to, sino, tibetan, and, benedict, s, sino, tibetan, a, conspectus, benedict, completed, the, manuscript, of, his, work, in, 1941, but, it, was, not, published, until, 1972, instead, of, building, the, entire, family, tree, he, set, out, to, reconstruct, a, proto, tibeto, burman, language, by, comparing, five, major, languages, with, occasional, comparisons, with, other, languages, he, reconstructed, a, two, way, distinction, on, initial, consonants, based, on, voicing, with, aspiration, conditioned, by, pre, initial, consonants, that, had, been, retained, in, tibetic, but, lost, in, many, other, languages, thus, benedict, reconstructed, the, following, initials, although, the, initial, consonants, of, cognates, tend, to, have, the, same, place, and, manner, of, articulation, voicing, and, aspiration, are, often, unpredictable, this, irregularity, was, attacked, by, roy, andrew, miller, though, benedict, s, supporters, attribute, it, to, the, effects, of, prefixes, that, have, been, lost, and, are, often, unrecoverable, the, issue, remains, unsolved, today, it, was, cited, together, with, the, lack, of, reconstructable, shared, morphology, and, evidence, that, much, shared, lexical, material, has, been, borrowed, from, chinese, into, tibeto, burman, by, christopher, beckwith, one, of, the, few, scholars, still, arguing, that, chinese, is, not, related, to, tibeto, burman, benedict, also, reconstructed, at, least, for, tibeto, burman, prefixes, such, as, the, causative, s, the, intransitive, m, and, r, b, g, and, d, of, uncertain, function, as, well, as, suffixes, s, t, and, n, old, chinese, is, by, far, the, oldest, recorded, sino, tibetan, language, with, inscriptions, dating, from, around, 1250, bc, and, a, huge, body, of, literature, from, the, first, millennium, bc, however, the, chinese, script, is, logographic, and, does, not, represent, sounds, systematically, it, is, therefore, difficult, to, reconstruct, the, phonology, of, the, language, from, the, written, records, scholars, have, sought, to, reconstruct, the, phonology, of, old, chinese, by, comparing, the, obscure, descriptions, of, the, sounds, of, middle, chinese, in, medieval, dictionaries, with, phonetic, elements, in, chinese, characters, and, the, rhyming, patterns, of, early, poetry, the, first, complete, reconstruction, the, grammata, serica, recensa, of, bernard, karlgren, was, used, by, benedict, and, shafer, karlgren, s, reconstruction, was, somewhat, unwieldy, with, many, sounds, having, a, highly, non, uniform, distribution, later, scholars, have, revised, it, by, drawing, on, a, range, of, other, sources, some, proposals, were, based, on, cognates, in, other, sino, tibetan, languages, though, workers, have, also, found, solely, chinese, evidence, for, them, for, example, recent, reconstructions, of, old, chinese, have, reduced, karlgren, s, 15, vowels, to, a, six, vowel, system, originally, suggested, by, nicholas, bodman, similarly, karlgren, s, l, has, been, recast, as, r, with, a, different, initial, interpreted, as, l, matching, tibeto, burman, cognates, but, also, supported, by, chinese, transcriptions, of, foreign, names, a, growing, number, of, scholars, believe, that, old, chinese, did, not, use, tones, and, that, the, tones, of, middle, chinese, developed, from, final, consonants, one, of, these, s, is, believed, to, be, a, suffix, with, cognates, in, other, sino, tibetan, languages, tibetic, has, extensive, written, records, from, the, adoption, of, writing, by, the, tibetan, empire, in, the, mid, 7th, century, the, earliest, records, of, burmese, such, as, the, 12th, century, myazedi, inscription, are, more, limited, but, later, an, extensive, literature, developed, both, languages, are, recorded, in, alphabetic, scripts, ultimately, derived, from, the, brahmi, script, of, ancient, india, most, comparative, work, has, used, the, conservative, written, forms, of, these, languages, following, the, dictionaries, of, j, schke, tibetan, and, judson, burmese, though, both, contain, entries, from, a, wide, range, of, periods, there, are, also, extensive, records, in, tangut, the, language, of, the, western, xia, 1038, 1227, tangut, is, recorded, in, a, chinese, inspired, logographic, script, whose, interpretation, presents, many, difficulties, even, though, multilingual, dictionaries, have, been, found, gong, hwang, cherng, has, compared, old, chinese, tibetic, burmese, and, tangut, to, establish, sound, correspondences, between, those, languages, he, found, that, tibetic, and, burmese, a, correspond, to, two, old, chinese, vowels, a, and, while, this, has, been, considered, evidence, for, a, separate, tibeto, burman, subgroup, hill, 2014, finds, that, burmese, has, distinct, correspondences, for, old, chinese, rhymes, ay, aj, and, i, j, and, hence, argues, that, the, development, a, occurred, independently, in, tibetan, and, burmese, the, descriptions, of, non, literary, languages, used, by, shafer, and, benedict, were, often, produced, by, missionaries, and, colonial, administrators, of, varying, linguistic, skills, most, of, the, smaller, sino, tibetan, languages, are, spoken, in, inaccessible, mountainous, areas, many, of, which, are, politically, or, militarily, sensitive, and, thus, closed, to, investigators, until, the, 1980s, the, best, studied, areas, were, nepal, and, northern, thailand, in, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, new, surveys, were, published, from, the, himalayas, and, southwestern, china, of, particular, interest, was, the, increasing, literature, on, the, qiangic, languages, of, western, sichuan, and, adjacent, areas, most, of, the, current, spread, of, sino, tibetan, languages, is, the, result, of, historical, expansions, of, the, three, groups, with, the, most, speakers, chinese, burmese, and, tibetic, replacing, an, unknown, number, of, earlier, languages, these, groups, also, have, the, longest, literary, traditions, of, the, family, the, remaining, languages, are, spoken, in, mountainous, areas, along, the, southern, slopes, of, the, himalayas, the, southeast, asian, massif, and, the, eastern, edge, of, the, tibetan, plateau, the, branch, with, the, largest, number, of, speakers, by, far, is, the, sinitic, languages, with, 1, 3, billion, speakers, most, of, whom, live, in, the, eastern, half, of, china, the, first, records, of, chinese, are, oracle, bone, inscriptions, from, c, 1250, bc, when, old, chinese, was, spoken, around, the, middle, reaches, of, the, yellow, river, chinese, has, since, expanded, throughout, china, forming, a, family, whose, diversity, has, been, compared, with, the, romance, languages, diversity, is, greater, in, the, rugged, terrain, of, southeast, china, than, in, the, north, china, plain, burmese, is, the, national, language, of, myanmar, and, the, first, language, of, some, 33, million, people, burmese, speakers, first, entered, the, northern, irrawaddy, basin, from, what, is, now, western, yunnan, in, the, early, ninth, century, in, conjunction, with, an, invasion, by, nanzhao, that, shattered, the, pyu, city, states, other, burmish, languages, are, still, spoken, in, dehong, prefecture, in, the, far, west, of, yunnan, by, the, 11th, century, their, pagan, kingdom, had, expanded, over, the, whole, basin, the, oldest, texts, such, as, the, myazedi, inscription, date, from, the, early, 12th, century, the, closely, related, loloish, languages, are, spoken, by, 9, million, people, in, the, mountains, of, western, sichuan, yunnan, and, nearby, areas, in, northern, myanmar, thailand, laos, and, vietnam, the, tibetic, languages, are, spoken, by, some, 6, million, people, on, the, tibetan, plateau, and, neighbouring, areas, in, the, himalayas, and, western, sichuan, they, are, descended, from, old, tibetan, which, was, originally, spoken, in, the, yarlung, valley, before, it, was, spread, by, the, expansion, of, the, tibetan, empire, in, the, seventh, century, although, the, empire, collapsed, in, the, ninth, century, classical, tibetan, remained, influential, as, the, liturgical, language, of, tibetan, buddhism, the, remaining, languages, are, spoken, in, upland, areas, southernmost, are, the, karen, languages, spoken, by, 4, million, people, in, the, hill, country, along, the, myanmar, thailand, border, with, the, greatest, diversity, in, the, karen, hills, which, are, believed, to, be, the, homeland, of, the, group, the, highlands, stretching, from, northeast, india, to, northern, myanmar, contain, over, 100, highly, diverse, sino, tibetan, languages, other, sino, tibetan, languages, are, found, along, the, southern, slopes, of, the, himalayas, and, the, eastern, edge, of, the, tibetan, plateau, the, 22, official, languages, listed, in, the, eighth, schedule, to, the, constitution, of, india, include, only, two, sino, tibetan, languages, namely, meitei, officially, called, manipuri, and, bodo, there, has, been, a, range, of, proposals, for, the, sino, tibetan, urheimat, reflecting, the, uncertainty, about, the, classification, of, the, family, and, its, time, depth, three, major, hypotheses, for, the, place, and, time, of, sino, tibetan, unity, have, been, presented, zhang, et, al, 2019, performed, a, computational, phylogenetic, analysis, of, 109, sino, tibetan, languages, to, suggest, a, sino, tibetan, homeland, in, northern, china, near, the, yellow, river, basin, the, study, further, suggests, that, there, was, an, initial, major, split, between, the, sinitic, and, tibeto, burman, languages, approximately, 4, 200, to, 7, 800, years, ago, with, an, average, of, 5, 900, years, ago, associated, with, the, yangshao, and, or, majiayao, cultures, sagart, et, al, 2019, performed, another, phylogenetic, analysis, based, on, different, data, and, methods, to, arrive, at, the, same, conclusions, to, the, homeland, and, divergence, model, but, proposed, an, earlier, root, age, of, approximately, 7, 200, years, ago, associating, its, origin, with, millet, farmers, of, the, late, cishan, culture, and, early, yangshao, culture, several, low, level, branches, of, the, family, particularly, lolo, burmese, have, been, securely, reconstructed, but, in, the, absence, of, a, secure, reconstruction, of, a, sino, tibetan, proto, language, the, higher, level, structure, of, the, family, remains, unclear, thus, a, conservative, classification, of, sino, tibetan, tibeto, burman, would, posit, several, dozen, small, coordinate, families, and, isolates, attempts, at, subgrouping, are, either, geographic, conveniences, or, hypotheses, for, further, research, in, a, survey, in, the, 1937, chinese, yearbook, li, fang, kuei, described, the, family, as, consisting, of, four, branches, tai, and, miao, yao, were, included, because, they, shared, isolating, typology, tone, systems, and, some, vocabulary, with, chinese, at, the, time, tone, was, considered, so, fundamental, to, language, that, tonal, typology, could, be, used, as, the, basis, for, classification, in, the, western, scholarly, community, these, languages, are, no, longer, included, in, sino, tibetan, with, the, similarities, attributed, to, diffusion, across, the, mainland, southeast, asia, linguistic, area, especially, since, benedict, 1942, the, exclusions, of, vietnamese, by, kuhn, and, of, tai, and, miao, yao, by, benedict, were, vindicated, in, 1954, when, andr, georges, haudricourt, demonstrated, that, the, tones, of, vietnamese, were, reflexes, of, final, consonants, from, proto, mon, khmer, many, chinese, linguists, continue, to, follow, li, s, classification, however, this, arrangement, remains, problematic, for, example, there, is, disagreement, over, whether, to, include, the, entire, kra, dai, family, or, just, kam, tai, zhuang, dong, excludes, the, kra, languages, because, the, chinese, cognates, that, form, the, basis, of, the, putative, relationship, are, not, found, in, all, branches, of, the, family, and, have, not, been, reconstructed, for, the, family, as, a, whole, in, addition, kam, tai, itself, no, longer, appears, to, be, a, valid, node, within, kra, dai, benedict, overtly, excluded, vietnamese, placing, it, in, mon, khmer, as, well, as, hmong, mien, and, kra, dai, placing, them, in, austro, tai, he, otherwise, retained, the, outlines, of, conrady, s, indo, chinese, classification, though, putting, karen, in, an, intermediate, position, shafer, criticized, the, division, of, the, family, into, tibeto, burman, and, sino, daic, branches, which, he, attributed, to, the, different, groups, of, languages, studied, by, konow, and, other, scholars, in, british, india, on, the, one, hand, and, by, henri, maspero, and, other, french, linguists, on, the, other, he, proposed, a, detailed, classification, with, six, top, level, divisions, shafer, was, sceptical, of, the, inclusion, of, daic, but, after, meeting, maspero, in, paris, decided, to, retain, it, pending, a, definitive, resolution, of, the, question, james, matisoff, abandoned, benedict, s, tibeto, karen, hypothesis, some, more, recent, western, scholars, such, as, bradley, 1997, and, la, polla, 2003, have, retained, matisoff, s, two, primary, branches, though, differing, in, the, details, of, tibeto, burman, however, jacques, 2006, notes, comparative, work, has, never, been, able, to, put, forth, evidence, for, common, innovations, to, all, the, tibeto, burman, languages, the, sino, tibetan, languages, to, the, exclusion, of, chinese, and, that, it, no, longer, seems, justified, to, treat, chinese, as, the, first, branching, of, the, sino, tibetan, family, because, the, morphological, divide, between, chinese, and, tibeto, burman, has, been, bridged, by, recent, reconstructions, of, old, chinese, the, internal, structure, of, sino, tibetan, has, been, tentatively, revised, as, the, following, stammbaum, by, matisoff, in, the, final, print, release, of, the, sino, tibetan, etymological, dictionary, and, thesaurus, stedt, in, 2015, matisoff, acknowledges, that, the, position, of, chinese, within, the, family, remains, an, open, question, sergei, starostin, proposed, that, both, the, kiranti, languages, and, chinese, are, divergent, from, a, core, tibeto, burman, of, at, least, bodish, lolo, burmese, tamangic, jinghpaw, kukish, and, karen, other, families, were, not, analysed, in, a, hypothesis, called, sino, kiranti, the, proposal, takes, two, forms, that, sinitic, and, kiranti, are, themselves, a, valid, node, or, that, the, two, are, not, demonstrably, close, so, that, sino, tibetan, has, three, primary, branches, george, van, driem, like, shafer, rejects, a, primary, split, between, chinese, and, the, rest, suggesting, that, chinese, owes, its, traditional, privileged, place, in, sino, tibetan, to, historical, typological, and, cultural, rather, than, linguistic, criteria, he, calls, the, entire, family, tibeto, burman, a, name, he, says, has, historical, primacy, but, other, linguists, who, reject, a, privileged, position, for, chinese, nevertheless, continue, to, call, the, resulting, family, sino, tibetan, like, matisoff, van, driem, acknowledges, that, the, relationships, of, the, kuki, naga, languages, kuki, mizo, meitei, etc, both, amongst, each, other, and, to, the, other, languages, of, the, family, remain, unclear, however, rather, than, placing, them, in, a, geographic, grouping, as, matisoff, does, van, driem, leaves, them, unclassified, he, has, proposed, several, hypotheses, including, the, reclassification, of, chinese, to, a, sino, bodic, subgroup, van, driem, points, to, two, main, pieces, of, evidence, establishing, a, special, relationship, between, sinitic, and, bodic, and, thus, placing, chinese, within, the, tibeto, burman, family, first, there, are, some, parallels, between, the, morphology, of, old, chinese, and, the, modern, bodic, languages, second, there, is, a, body, of, lexical, cognates, between, the, chinese, and, bodic, languages, represented, by, the, kirantic, language, limbu, in, response, matisoff, notes, that, the, existence, of, shared, lexical, material, only, serves, to, establish, an, absolute, relationship, between, two, language, families, not, their, relative, relationship, to, one, another, although, some, cognate, sets, presented, by, van, driem, are, confined, to, chinese, and, bodic, many, others, are, found, in, sino, tibetan, languages, generally, and, thus, do, not, serve, as, evidence, for, a, special, relationship, between, chinese, and, bodic, van, driem, has, also, proposed, a, fallen, leaves, model, that, lists, dozens, of, well, established, low, level, groups, while, remaining, agnostic, about, intermediate, groupings, of, these, in, the, most, recent, version, van, driem, 2014, 42, groups, are, identified, with, individual, languages, highlighted, in, italics, he, also, suggested, van, driem, 2007, that, the, sino, tibetan, language, family, be, renamed, trans, himalayan, which, he, considers, to, be, more, neutral, orlandi, 2021, also, considers, the, van, driem, s, trans, himalayan, fallen, leaves, model, to, be, more, plausible, than, the, bifurcate, classification, of, sino, tibetan, being, split, into, sinitic, and, tibeto, burman, roger, blench, and, mark, w, post, have, criticized, the, applicability, of, conventional, sino, tibetan, classification, schemes, to, minor, languages, lacking, an, extensive, written, history, unlike, chinese, tibetic, and, burmese, they, find, that, the, evidence, for, the, subclassification, or, even, st, affiliation, in, all, of, several, minor, languages, of, northeastern, india, in, particular, is, either, poor, or, absent, altogether, while, relatively, little, has, been, known, about, the, languages, of, this, region, up, to, and, including, the, present, time, this, has, not, stopped, scholars, from, proposing, that, these, languages, either, constitute, or, fall, within, some, other, tibeto, burman, subgroup, however, in, the, absence, of, any, sort, of, systematic, comparison, whether, the, data, are, thought, reliable, or, not, such, subgroupings, are, essentially, vacuous, the, use, of, pseudo, genetic, labels, such, as, himalayish, and, kamarupan, inevitably, gives, an, impression, of, coherence, which, is, at, best, misleading, in, their, view, many, such, languages, would, for, now, be, best, considered, unclassified, or, internal, isolates, within, the, family, they, propose, a, provisional, classification, of, the, remaining, languages, following, that, because, they, propose, that, the, three, best, known, branches, may, be, much, closer, related, to, each, other, than, they, are, to, minor, sino, tibetan, languages, blench, and, post, argue, that, sino, tibetan, or, tibeto, burman, are, inappropriate, names, for, a, family, whose, earliest, divergences, led, to, different, languages, altogether, they, support, the, proposed, name, trans, himalayan, a, team, of, researchers, led, by, pan, wuyun, and, jin, li, proposed, the, following, phylogenetic, tree, in, 2019, based, on, lexical, items, except, for, the, chinese, bai, karenic, and, mruic, languages, the, usual, word, order, in, sino, tibetan, languages, is, object, verb, however, chinese, and, bai, differ, from, almost, all, other, subject, verb, object, languages, in, the, world, in, placing, relative, clauses, before, the, nouns, they, modify, most, scholars, believe, sov, to, be, the, original, order, with, chinese, karen, and, bai, having, acquired, svo, order, due, to, the, influence, of, neighbouring, languages, in, the, mainland, southeast, asia, linguistic, area, this, has, been, criticized, as, being, insufficiently, corroborated, by, djamouri, et, al, 2007, who, instead, reconstruct, a, vo, order, for, proto, sino, tibetan, contrastive, tones, are, a, feature, found, across, the, family, although, absent, in, some, languages, like, purik, phonation, contrasts, are, also, present, among, many, notably, in, the, lolo, burmese, group, while, benedict, contended, that, proto, tibeto, burman, would, have, a, two, tone, system, matisoff, refrained, from, reconstructing, it, since, tones, in, individual, languages, may, have, developed, independently, through, the, process, of, tonogenesis, sino, tibetan, is, structurally, one, of, the, most, diverse, language, families, in, the, world, including, all, of, the, gradation, of, morphological, complexity, from, isolating, lolo, burmese, tujia, to, polysynthetic, gyalrongic, kiranti, languages, while, sinitic, languages, are, normally, taken, to, be, a, prototypical, example, of, the, isolating, morphological, type, southern, chinese, languages, express, this, trait, far, more, strongly, than, northern, chinese, languages, do, initial, consonant, alternations, related, to, transitivity, are, pervasive, in, sino, tibetan, while, devoicing, or, aspiration, of, the, initial, is, associated, with, a, transitive, causative, verb, voicing, is, linked, to, its, intransitive, anticausative, counterpart, this, is, argued, to, reflect, morphological, derivations, that, existed, in, earlier, stages, of, the, family, even, in, chinese, one, would, find, semantically, related, pairs, of, verbs, such, as, to, see, mc, kenh, and, to, appear, enh, which, are, respectively, reconstructed, as, en, s, and, n, en, s, in, the, baxter, sagart, system, of, old, chinese, in, morphosyntactic, alignment, many, tibeto, burman, languages, have, ergative, and, or, anti, ergative, an, argument, that, is, not, an, actor, case, marking, however, the, anti, ergative, case, markings, can, not, be, reconstructed, at, higher, levels, in, the, family, and, are, thought, to, be, innovations, many, sino, tibetan, languages, exhibit, a, system, of, person, indexation, notably, gyalrongic, and, kiranti, have, an, inverse, marker, prefixed, to, a, transitive, verb, when, the, agent, is, lower, than, the, patient, in, a, certain, person, hierarchy, hodgson, had, in, 1849, noted, a, dichotomy, between, pronominalized, inflecting, languages, stretching, across, the, himalayas, from, himachal, pradesh, to, eastern, nepal, and, non, pronominalized, isolating, languages, konow, 1909, explained, the, pronominalized, languages, as, due, to, a, munda, substratum, with, the, idea, that, indo, chinese, languages, were, essentially, isolating, as, well, as, tonal, maspero, later, attributed, the, putative, substratum, to, indo, aryan, it, was, not, until, benedict, that, the, inflectional, systems, of, these, languages, were, recognized, as, partially, native, to, the, family, scholars, disagree, over, the, extent, to, which, the, agreement, system, in, the, various, languages, can, be, reconstructed, for, the, proto, language, although, not, very, common, in, some, families, and, linguistic, areas, like, standard, average, european, fairly, complex, systems, of, evidentiality, grammatical, marking, of, information, source, are, found, in, many, tibeto, burman, languages, the, family, has, also, contributed, to, the, study, of, mirativity, and, egophoricity, which, are, relatively, new, concepts, in, linguistic, typology, beyond, the, traditionally, recognized, families, of, southeast, asia, some, possible, broader, relationships, have, been, suggested, laurent, sagart, proposes, a, sino, austronesian, family, with, sino, tibetan, and, austronesian, including, kra, dai, as, a, subbranch, as, primary, branches, stanley, starosta, has, extended, this, proposal, with, a, further, branch, called, yangzian, joining, hmong, mien, and, austroasiatic, the, proposal, has, been, largely, rejected, by, other, linguists, who, argue, that, the, similarities, between, austronesian, and, sino, tibetan, more, likely, arose, from, contact, rather, than, being, genetic, as, noted, by, tailleur, and, werner, some, of, the, earliest, proposals, of, genetic, relations, of, yeniseian, by, m, a, castr, n, 1856, james, byrne, 1892, and, g, j, ramstedt, 1907, suggested, that, yeniseian, was, a, northern, relative, of, the, sino, tibetan, languages, these, ideas, were, followed, much, later, by, kai, donner, and, karl, bouda, a, 2008, study, found, further, evidence, for, a, possible, relation, between, yeniseian, and, sino, tibetan, citing, several, possible, cognates, gao, jingyi, 2014, identified, twelve, sinitic, and, yeniseian, shared, etymologies, that, belonged, to, the, basic, vocabulary, and, argued, that, these, sino, yeniseian, etymologies, could, not, be, loans, from, either, language, into, the, other, the, sino, caucasian, hypothesis, of, sergei, starostin, posits, that, the, yeniseian, languages, form, a, clade, with, sino, tibetan, which, he, called, sino, yeniseian, the, sino, caucasian, hypothesis, has, been, expanded, by, others, to, den, caucasian, to, include, the, na, den, languages, of, north, america, burushaski, basque, and, occasionally, etruscan, a, narrower, binary, den, yeniseian, family, has, recently, been, well, received, the, validity, of, the, rest, of, the, family, however, is, viewed, as, doubtful, or, rejected, by, nearly, all, historical, linguists, a, link, between, the, na, den, languages, and, sino, tibetan, languages, known, as, sino, den, had, also, been, proposed, by, edward, sapir, around, 1920, sapir, became, convinced, that, na, den, was, more, closely, related, to, sino, tibetan, than, to, other, american, families, edward, vadja, s, den, yeniseian, proposal, renewed, interest, among, linguists, such, as, geoffrey, caveney, 2014, to, look, into, support, for, the, sino, den, hypothesis, caveney, considered, a, link, between, sino, tibetan, na, den, and, yeniseian, to, be, plausible, but, did, not, support, the, hypothesis, that, sino, tibetan, and, na, den, were, related, to, the, caucasian, languages, sino, caucasian, and, den, caucasian, a, 2023, analysis, by, david, bradley, using, the, standard, techniques, of, comparative, linguistics, supports, a, distant, genetic, link, between, the, sino, tibetan, na, den, and, yeniseian, language, families, bradley, argues, that, any, similarities, sino, tibetan, shares, with, other, language, families, of, the, east, asia, area, such, as, hmong, mien, altaic, which, is, a, sprachbund, austroasiatic, kra, dai, austronesian, came, through, contact, but, as, there, has, been, no, recent, contact, between, the, sino, tibetan, na, den, and, yeniseian, language, families, any, similarities, these, groups, share, must, be, residual, august, conrad, proposed, the, sino, tibetan, indo, european, language, family, this, hypothesis, holds, that, there, is, a, genetic, relationship, between, the, sino, tibetan, language, family, and, the, indo, european, language, family, the, earliest, comparative, linguistic, study, of, chinese, and, indo, european, languages, was, by, the, 18th, century, nordic, scholar, olaus, rudbeck, he, compared, the, vocabulary, of, gothic, and, chinese, and, guessed, that, the, two, may, be, of, the, same, origin, in, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, kong, haogu, shigude, ijosser, etc, successively, proposed, that, chinese, and, european, languages, are, homologous, among, them, kong, haogu, through, the, comparison, of, chinese, and, indo, european, domestic, animal, vocabulary, first, proposed, an, indo, chinese, language, macrofamily, including, chinese, tibetan, burmese, and, indo, european, languages, in, the, 20th, century, r, shafer, put, forward, the, conjecture, of, a, eurasial, language, super, family, and, listed, hundreds, of, similar, words, between, tibeto, burman, and, indo, european, languages
