immigration, is, the, international, movement, of, people, to, a, destination, country, of, which, they, are, not, usual, residents, or, where, they, do, not, possess, nationality, in, order, to, settle, as, permanent, residents, commuters, tourists, and, other, short, term, stays, in, a, destination, country, do, not, fall, under, the, definition, of, immigration, or, migration, seasonal, labour, immigration, is, sometimes, included, however, as, for, economic, effects, research, suggests, that, migration, is, beneficial, both, to, the, receiving, and, sending, countries, research, with, few, exceptions, finds, that, immigration, on, average, has, positive, economic, effects, on, the, native, population, but, is, mixed, as, to, whether, low, skilled, immigration, adversely, affects, underprivileged, natives, studies, suggest, that, the, elimination, of, barriers, to, migration, would, have, profound, effects, on, world, gdp, with, estimates, of, gains, ranging, between, 67, and, 147, percent, for, the, scenarios, in, which, 37, to, 53, percent, of, the, developing, countries, workers, migrate, to, the, developed, countries, some, development, economists, argue, that, reducing, barriers, to, labor, mobility, between, developing, countries, and, developed, countries, would, be, one, of, the, most, efficient, tools, of, poverty, reduction, positive, net, immigration, can, soften, the, demographic, dilemma, in, the, aging, global, north, the, academic, literature, provides, mixed, findings, for, the, relationship, between, immigration, and, crime, worldwide, but, finds, for, the, united, states, that, immigration, either, has, no, impact, on, the, crime, rate, or, that, it, reduces, the, crime, rate, research, shows, that, country, of, origin, matters, for, speed, and, depth, of, immigrant, assimilation, but, that, there, is, considerable, assimilation, overall, for, both, first, and, second, generation, immigrants, research, has, found, extensive, evidence, of, discrimination, against, foreign, born, and, minority, populations, in, criminal, justice, business, the, economy, housing, health, care, media, and, politics, in, the, united, states, and, europe, the, term, immigration, was, coined, in, the, 17th, century, referring, to, non, warlike, population, movements, between, the, emerging, nation, states, when, people, cross, national, borders, during, their, migration, they, are, called, migrants, or, immigrants, from, latin, migrare, wanderer, from, the, perspective, of, the, destination, country, in, contrast, from, the, perspective, of, the, country, from, which, they, leave, they, are, called, emigrants, or, outmigrants, human, migration, is, the, movement, by, people, from, one, place, to, another, particularly, different, countries, with, the, intention, of, settling, temporarily, or, permanently, in, the, new, location, it, typically, involves, movements, over, long, distances, and, from, one, country, or, region, to, another, the, number, of, people, involved, in, every, wave, of, immigration, differs, depending, on, the, specific, circumstances, historically, early, human, migration, includes, the, peopling, of, the, world, i, e, migration, to, world, regions, where, there, was, previously, no, human, habitation, during, the, upper, paleolithic, since, the, neolithic, most, migrations, except, for, the, peopling, of, remote, regions, such, as, the, arctic, or, the, pacific, were, predominantly, warlike, consisting, of, conquest, or, landnahme, on, the, part, of, expanding, populations, colonialism, involves, expansion, of, sedentary, populations, into, previously, only, sparsely, settled, territories, or, territories, with, no, permanent, settlements, in, the, modern, period, human, migration, has, primarily, taken, the, form, of, migration, within, and, between, existing, sovereign, states, either, controlled, legal, immigration, or, uncontrolled, and, in, violation, of, immigration, laws, illegal, immigration, as, of, 2015, the, number, of, international, migrants, has, reached, 244, million, worldwide, which, reflects, a, 41, increase, since, 2000, the, largest, number, of, international, migrants, live, in, the, united, states, with, 19, of, the, world, s, total, one, third, of, the, world, s, international, migrants, are, living, in, just, 20, countries, germany, and, russia, host, 12, million, migrants, each, taking, the, second, and, third, place, in, countries, with, the, most, migrants, worldwide, saudi, arabia, hosts, 10, million, migrants, followed, by, the, united, kingdom, 9, million, and, the, united, arab, emirates, 8, million, in, most, parts, of, the, world, migration, occurs, between, countries, that, are, located, within, the, same, major, area, between, 2000, and, 2015, asia, added, more, international, migrants, than, any, other, major, area, in, the, world, gaining, 26, million, europe, added, the, second, largest, with, about, 20, million, in, 2015, the, number, of, international, migrants, below, the, age, of, 20, reached, 37, million, while, 177, million, are, between, the, ages, of, 20, and, 64, international, migrants, living, in, africa, were, the, youngest, with, a, median, age, of, 29, followed, by, asia, 35, years, and, latin, america, caribbean, 36, years, while, migrants, were, older, in, northern, america, 42, years, europe, 43, years, and, oceania, 44, years, nearly, half, 43, of, all, international, migrants, originate, in, asia, and, europe, was, the, birthplace, of, the, second, largest, number, of, migrants, 25, followed, by, latin, america, 15, india, has, the, largest, diaspora, in, the, world, 16, million, people, followed, by, mexico, 12, million, and, russia, 11, million, a, 2012, survey, by, gallup, found, that, given, the, opportunity, 640, million, adults, would, migrate, to, another, country, with, 23, of, these, would, be, immigrant, choosing, the, united, states, as, their, desired, future, residence, while, 7, of, respondents, representing, 45, million, people, would, choose, the, united, kingdom, canada, france, saudi, arabia, australia, germany, spain, italy, and, the, united, arab, emirates, made, up, the, rest, of, the, top, ten, desired, destination, countries, in, usa, there, were, in, 2023, 1, 197, 254, immigration, applications, initial, receipts, 523, 477, immigration, cases, completed, and, 2, 464, 021, immigration, cases, pending, according, to, the, u, s, department, of, justice, one, theory, of, immigration, distinguishes, between, push, and, pull, factors, referring, to, the, economic, political, and, social, influences, by, which, people, migrate, from, or, to, specific, countries, immigrants, are, motivated, to, leave, their, former, countries, of, citizenship, or, habitual, residence, for, a, variety, of, reasons, including, a, lack, of, local, access, to, resources, a, desire, for, economic, prosperity, to, find, or, engage, in, paid, work, to, better, their, standard, of, living, family, reunification, retirement, climate, or, environmentally, induced, migration, exile, escape, from, prejudice, conflict, or, natural, disaster, or, simply, the, wish, to, change, one, s, quality, of, life, commuters, tourists, and, other, short, term, stays, in, a, destination, country, do, not, fall, under, the, definition, of, immigration, or, migration, seasonal, labour, immigration, is, sometimes, included, however, push, factors, or, determinant, factors, refer, primarily, to, the, motive, for, leaving, one, s, country, of, origin, either, voluntarily, or, involuntarily, whereas, pull, factors, or, attraction, factors, refer, to, one, s, motivations, behind, or, the, encouragement, towards, immigrating, to, a, particular, country, in, the, case, of, economic, migration, usually, labor, migration, differentials, in, wage, rates, are, common, if, the, value, of, wages, in, the, new, country, surpasses, the, value, of, wages, in, one, s, native, country, he, or, she, may, choose, to, migrate, as, long, as, the, costs, are, not, too, high, particularly, in, the, 19th, century, economic, expansion, of, the, us, increased, immigrant, flow, and, nearly, 15, of, the, population, was, foreign, born, thus, making, up, a, significant, amount, of, the, labor, force, as, transportation, technology, improved, travel, time, and, costs, decreased, dramatically, between, the, 18th, and, early, 20th, century, travel, across, the, atlantic, used, to, take, up, to, 5, weeks, in, the, 18th, century, but, around, the, time, of, the, 20th, century, it, took, a, mere, 8, days, when, the, opportunity, cost, is, lower, the, immigration, rates, tend, to, be, higher, escape, from, poverty, personal, or, for, relatives, staying, behind, is, a, traditional, push, factor, and, the, availability, of, jobs, is, the, related, pull, factor, natural, disasters, can, amplify, poverty, driven, migration, flows, research, shows, that, for, middle, income, countries, higher, temperatures, increase, emigration, rates, to, urban, areas, and, to, other, countries, for, low, income, countries, higher, temperatures, reduce, emigration, emigration, and, immigration, are, sometimes, mandatory, in, a, contract, of, employment, religious, missionaries, and, employees, of, transnational, corporations, international, non, governmental, organizations, and, the, diplomatic, service, expect, by, definition, to, work, overseas, they, are, often, referred, to, as, expatriates, and, their, conditions, of, employment, are, typically, equal, to, or, better, than, those, applying, in, the, host, country, for, similar, work, non, economic, push, factors, include, persecution, religious, and, otherwise, frequent, abuse, bullying, oppression, ethnic, cleansing, genocide, risks, to, civilians, during, war, and, social, marginalization, political, motives, traditionally, motivate, refugee, flows, for, instance, people, may, emigrate, in, order, to, escape, a, dictatorship, some, migration, is, for, personal, reasons, based, on, a, relationship, e, g, to, be, with, family, or, a, partner, such, as, in, family, reunification, or, transnational, marriage, especially, in, the, instance, of, a, gender, imbalance, recent, research, has, found, gender, age, and, cross, cultural, differences, in, the, ownership, of, the, idea, to, immigrate, in, a, few, cases, an, individual, may, wish, to, immigrate, to, a, new, country, in, a, form, of, transferred, patriotism, evasion, of, criminal, justice, e, g, avoiding, arrest, is, a, personal, motivation, this, type, of, emigration, and, immigration, is, not, normally, legal, if, a, crime, is, internationally, recognized, although, criminals, may, disguise, their, identities, or, find, other, loopholes, to, evade, detection, for, example, there, have, been, reports, of, war, criminals, disguising, themselves, as, victims, of, war, or, conflict, and, then, pursuing, asylum, in, a, different, country, barriers, to, immigration, come, not, only, in, legal, form, or, political, form, natural, and, social, barriers, to, immigration, can, also, be, very, powerful, immigrants, when, leaving, their, country, also, leave, everything, familiar, their, family, friends, support, network, and, culture, they, also, need, to, liquidate, their, assets, and, they, incur, the, expense, of, moving, when, they, arrive, in, a, new, country, this, is, often, with, many, uncertainties, including, finding, work, where, to, live, new, laws, new, cultural, norms, language, or, accent, issues, possible, racism, and, other, exclusionary, behavior, towards, them, and, their, family, the, politics, of, immigration, have, become, increasingly, associated, with, other, issues, such, as, national, security, and, terrorism, especially, in, western, europe, with, the, presence, of, islam, as, a, new, major, religion, those, with, security, concerns, cite, the, 2005, french, riots, and, point, to, the, jyllands, posten, muhammad, cartoons, controversy, as, examples, of, the, value, conflicts, arising, from, immigration, of, muslims, in, western, europe, because, of, all, these, associations, immigration, has, become, an, emotional, political, issue, in, many, european, nations, studies, have, suggested, that, some, special, interest, groups, lobby, for, less, immigration, for, their, own, group, and, more, immigration, for, other, groups, since, they, see, effects, of, immigration, such, as, increased, labor, competition, as, detrimental, when, affecting, their, own, group, but, beneficial, when, impacting, other, groups, a, 2010, european, study, suggested, that, employers, are, more, likely, to, be, pro, immigration, than, employees, provided, that, immigrants, are, thought, to, compete, with, employees, who, are, already, in, the, country, or, else, when, immigrants, are, thought, to, compete, with, employers, rather, than, employees, employers, are, more, likely, to, be, anti, immigration, than, employees, a, 2011, study, examining, the, voting, of, us, representatives, on, migration, policy, suggests, that, representatives, from, more, skilled, labor, abundant, districts, are, more, likely, to, support, an, open, immigration, policy, towards, the, unskilled, whereas, the, opposite, is, true, for, representatives, from, more, unskilled, labor, abundant, districts, another, contributing, factor, may, be, lobbying, by, earlier, immigrants, the, chairman, for, the, us, irish, lobby, for, immigration, reform, which, lobby, for, more, permissive, rules, for, immigrants, as, well, as, special, arrangements, just, for, irish, people, has, stated, that, the, irish, lobby, will, push, for, any, special, arrangement, it, can, get, as, will, every, other, ethnic, group, in, the, country, several, countries, have, been, accused, of, encouraging, immigration, to, other, countries, in, order, to, create, divisions, the, term, economic, migrant, refers, to, someone, who, has, travelled, from, one, region, to, another, region, for, the, purposes, of, seeking, employment, and, an, improvement, in, quality, of, life, and, access, to, resources, an, economic, migrant, is, distinct, from, someone, who, is, a, refugee, fleeing, persecution, many, countries, have, immigration, and, visa, restrictions, that, prohibit, a, person, entering, the, country, for, the, purposes, of, gaining, work, without, a, valid, work, visa, as, a, violation, of, a, state, s, immigration, laws, a, person, who, is, declared, to, be, an, economic, migrant, can, be, refused, entry, into, a, country, the, world, bank, estimates, that, remittances, totaled, 420, billion, in, 2009, of, which, 317, billion, went, to, developing, countries, a, survey, of, european, economists, shows, a, consensus, that, freer, movement, of, people, to, live, and, work, across, borders, within, europe, makes, the, average, european, better, off, and, strong, support, behind, the, notion, that, it, has, not, made, low, skilled, europeans, worse, off, according, to, david, card, christian, dustmann, and, ian, preston, most, existing, studies, of, the, economic, impacts, of, immigration, suggest, these, impacts, are, small, and, on, average, benefit, the, native, population, in, a, survey, of, the, existing, literature, rn, b, bodvarsson, and, hendrik, van, den, berg, write, a, comparison, of, the, evidence, from, all, the, studies, makes, it, clear, that, with, very, few, exceptions, there, is, no, strong, statistical, support, for, the, view, held, by, many, members, of, the, public, mainly, that, immigration, has, an, adverse, effect, on, native, born, workers, in, the, destination, country, research, also, suggests, that, diversity, and, immigration, have, a, net, positive, effect, on, productivity, and, economic, prosperity, immigration, has, also, been, associated, with, reductions, in, offshoring, a, study, found, that, the, age, of, mass, migration, 1850, 1920, contributed, to, higher, incomes, higher, productivity, more, innovation, and, more, industrialization, in, the, short, run, and, higher, incomes, less, poverty, less, unemployment, higher, rates, of, urbanization, and, greater, educational, attainment, in, the, long, run, for, the, united, states, research, also, shows, that, migration, to, latin, america, during, the, age, of, mass, migration, had, a, positive, impact, on, long, run, economic, development, a, 2016, paper, by, university, of, southern, denmark, and, university, of, copenhagen, economists, found, that, the, 1924, immigration, restrictions, enacted, in, the, united, states, impaired, the, economy, the, view, that, economic, impact, on, the, average, native, tends, to, be, only, small, and, positive, is, disputed, by, some, studies, such, as, a, 2023, statistical, analysis, of, historical, immigration, data, in, netherlands, which, found, economic, effects, with, both, larger, positive, and, negative, net, contributions, per, capita, depending, on, different, factors, including, previous, education, and, income, of, the, immigrant, effects, may, vary, due, to, factors, like, the, migrants, age, education, reason, for, migration, the, strength, of, the, economy, and, how, long, ago, the, migration, took, place, overall, immigration, was, found, to, account, for, a, relatively, small, share, of, the, rise, of, native, wage, inequality, but, low, skill, immigration, has, been, linked, to, greater, income, inequality, in, the, native, population, measuring, the, national, impact, of, immigration, on, the, change, of, total, gdp, or, on, the, change, of, gdp, per, capita, can, have, distinct, results, david, card, s, 1990, work, is, considered, a, landmark, study, in, the, topic, it, followed, the, mariel, boatlift, a, natural, experiment, when, 125, 000, cubans, marielitos, came, to, miami, after, a, sudden, relaxation, in, emigration, rules, it, lacked, the, limitations, of, previous, studies, including, that, migrants, often, choose, high, wage, cities, so, increases, in, wages, could, simply, be, a, result, of, the, economic, success, of, the, city, rather, than, the, migrants, but, the, marielitos, chose, miami, simply, because, it, was, near, cuba, rather, than, for, lucrative, wages, preceding, studies, were, also, limited, in, that, firms, and, natives, may, respond, to, migration, and, its, effects, by, moving, to, more, lucrative, areas, however, the, six, month, period, of, this, migration, was, too, brief, for, most, firms, or, individuals, to, leave, miami, another, natural, experiment, followed, a, group, of, czech, workers, who, shortly, after, the, fall, of, the, berlin, wall, were, suddenly, able, to, work, in, germany, though, they, continued, to, live, in, czechia, it, found, significant, declines, in, native, wages, and, employment, as, a, result, it, is, argued, migrants, must, also, spend, their, wages, in, the, employing, country, in, order, to, stimulate, the, economy, and, offset, their, impacts, according, to, economists, michael, clemens, and, lant, pritchett, permitting, people, to, move, from, low, productivity, places, to, high, productivity, places, appears, to, be, by, far, the, most, efficient, generalized, policy, tool, at, the, margin, for, poverty, reduction, a, successful, two, year, in, situ, anti, poverty, program, for, instance, helps, poor, people, make, in, a, year, what, is, the, equivalent, of, working, one, day, in, the, developed, world, a, slight, reduction, in, the, barriers, to, labor, mobility, between, the, developing, and, developed, world, could, do, more, to, reduce, poverty, in, the, developing, world, than, any, remaining, trade, liberalization, studies, show, that, the, elimination, of, barriers, to, migration, could, have, profound, effects, on, world, gdp, with, estimates, of, gains, ranging, between, 67, and, 147, 3, research, also, finds, that, migration, leads, to, greater, trade, in, goods, and, services, and, increases, in, financial, flows, between, the, sending, and, receiving, countries, greater, openness, to, low, skilled, immigration, in, wealthy, countries, could, drastically, reduce, global, income, inequality, according, to, branko, milanovi, country, of, residency, is, by, far, the, most, important, determinant, of, global, income, inequality, which, suggests, that, the, reduction, in, labor, barriers, could, significantly, reduce, global, income, inequality, research, on, a, migration, lottery, allowing, tongans, to, move, to, new, zealand, found, that, the, lottery, winners, saw, a, 263, increase, in, income, from, migrating, after, only, one, year, in, new, zealand, relative, to, the, unsuccessful, lottery, entrants, a, longer, term, study, on, the, tongan, lottery, winners, finds, that, they, continue, to, earn, almost, 300, percent, more, than, non, migrants, have, better, mental, health, live, in, households, with, more, than, 250, percent, higher, expenditure, own, more, vehicles, and, have, more, durable, assets, a, conservative, estimate, of, their, lifetime, gain, to, migration, is, nz, 315, 000, in, net, present, value, terms, approximately, us, 237, 000, a, 2017, study, of, mexican, immigrant, households, in, the, united, states, found, that, by, virtue, of, moving, to, the, united, states, the, households, increase, their, incomes, more, than, fivefold, immediately, the, study, also, found, that, the, average, gains, accruing, to, migrants, surpass, those, of, even, the, most, successful, current, programs, of, economic, development, a, 2017, study, of, european, migrant, workers, in, the, uk, shows, that, upon, accession, to, the, eu, the, migrant, workers, see, a, substantial, positive, impact, on, their, earnings, the, data, indicate, that, acquiring, eu, status, raises, earnings, for, the, workers, by, giving, them, the, right, to, freely, change, jobs, a, 2017, study, in, the, quarterly, journal, of, economics, found, that, immigrants, from, middle, and, low, income, countries, to, the, united, states, increased, their, wages, by, a, factor, of, two, to, three, upon, migration, a, survey, of, leading, economists, shows, a, consensus, behind, the, view, that, high, skilled, immigration, makes, the, average, american, better, off, a, survey, of, the, same, economists, also, shows, support, behind, the, notion, that, low, skilled, immigration, makes, the, average, american, better, off, and, makes, many, low, skilled, american, workers, substantially, worse, off, unless, they, are, compensated, by, others, studies, show, more, mixed, results, for, low, skilled, natives, but, whether, the, effects, are, positive, or, negative, they, tend, to, be, small, either, way, research, indicates, immigrants, are, more, likely, to, work, in, risky, jobs, than, u, s, born, workers, partly, due, to, differences, in, average, characteristics, such, as, immigrants, lower, english, language, ability, and, educational, attainment, according, to, a, 2017, survey, of, the, existing, economic, literature, studies, on, high, skilled, migrants, rarely, find, adverse, wage, and, employment, consequences, and, longer, time, horizons, tend, to, show, greater, gains, competition, from, immigrants, in, a, particular, profession, may, aggravate, underemployment, in, that, profession, but, increase, wages, for, other, natives, for, instance, a, 2017, study, in, science, found, that, the, influx, of, foreign, born, computer, scientists, since, the, early, 1990s, increased, the, size, of, the, us, it, sector, benefited, consumers, via, lower, prices, and, more, efficient, products, raised, overall, worker, incomes, by, 0, 2, to, 0, 3, but, decreased, wages, of, u, s, computer, scientists, by, 2, 6, to, 5, 1, a, 2019, study, found, that, foreign, college, workers, in, stem, occupations, did, not, displace, native, college, workers, in, stem, occupations, but, instead, had, a, positive, impact, on, the, latter, group, s, wages, a, 2021, study, similarly, found, that, highly, educated, immigrants, to, switzerland, caused, wages, to, increase, for, highly, educated, swiss, natives, a, 2019, study, found, that, greater, immigration, led, to, less, off, shoring, by, firms, by, increasing, overall, demand, immigrants, could, push, natives, out, of, low, skilled, manual, labor, into, better, paying, occupations, a, 2018, study, in, the, american, economic, review, found, that, the, bracero, program, which, allowed, almost, half, a, million, mexican, workers, to, do, seasonal, farm, labor, in, the, united, states, did, not, have, any, adverse, impact, on, the, labor, market, outcomes, of, american, born, farm, workers, a, 2019, study, by, economic, historians, found, that, immigration, restrictions, implemented, in, the, 1920s, had, an, adverse, impact, on, us, born, workers, earnings, a, 2011, literature, review, of, the, economic, impacts, of, immigration, found, that, the, net, fiscal, impact, of, migrants, varies, across, studies, but, that, the, most, credible, analyses, typically, find, small, and, positive, fiscal, effects, on, average, according, to, the, authors, the, net, social, impact, of, an, immigrant, over, his, or, her, lifetime, depends, substantially, and, in, predictable, ways, on, the, immigrant, s, age, at, arrival, education, reason, for, migration, and, similar, according, to, a, 2007, literature, review, by, the, congressional, budget, office, over, the, past, two, decades, most, efforts, to, estimate, the, fiscal, impact, of, immigration, in, the, united, states, have, concluded, that, in, aggregate, and, over, the, long, term, tax, revenues, of, all, types, generated, by, immigrants, both, legal, and, unauthorized, exceed, the, cost, of, the, services, they, use, a, 2022, study, found, that, the, sharp, reduction, in, refugee, admissions, adversely, affected, public, coffers, at, all, levels, of, government, in, the, united, states, a, 2018, study, found, that, inflows, of, asylum, seekers, into, western, europe, from, 1985, to, 2015, had, a, net, positive, fiscal, impact, research, has, shown, that, eu, immigrants, made, a, net, positive, fiscal, contribution, to, denmark, and, the, united, kingdom, a, 2017, study, found, that, when, romanian, and, bulgarian, immigrants, to, the, united, kingdom, gained, permission, to, acquire, welfare, benefits, in, 2014, that, it, had, no, discernible, impact, on, the, immigrants, use, of, welfare, benefits, a, paper, by, a, group, of, french, economists, found, that, over, the, period, 1980, 2015, international, migration, had, a, positive, impact, on, the, economic, and, fiscal, performance, of, oecd, countries, a, 2023, study, in, the, netherlands, found, both, large, positive, and, large, negative, fiscal, impact, depending, on, previous, education, and, income, of, immigrant, a, 2017, survey, of, leading, economists, found, that, 34, of, economists, agreed, with, the, statement, the, influx, of, refugees, into, germany, beginning, in, the, summer, of, 2015, will, generate, net, economic, benefits, for, german, citizens, over, the, succeeding, decade, whereas, 38, were, uncertain, and, 6, disagreed, studies, of, refugees, impact, on, native, welfare, are, scant, but, the, existing, literature, shows, mixed, results, negative, positive, and, no, significant, effects, according, to, economist, michael, clemens, when, economists, have, studied, past, influxes, of, refugees, and, migrants, they, have, found, the, labor, market, effects, while, varied, are, very, limited, and, can, in, fact, be, positive, a, 2018, study, in, the, economic, journal, found, that, vietnamese, refugees, to, the, united, states, had, a, positive, impact, on, american, exports, as, exports, to, vietnam, grew, most, in, us, states, with, larger, vietnamese, populations, a, 2018, study, in, the, journal, science, advances, found, that, asylum, seekers, entering, western, europe, in, the, period, 1985, 2015, had, a, positive, macroeconomic, and, fiscal, impact, a, 2019, study, found, that, the, mass, influx, of, 1, 3, million, syrian, refugees, to, jordan, total, population, 6, 6, million, did, not, have, harm, the, labor, market, outcomes, of, native, jordanians, a, 2020, study, found, that, syrian, refugees, to, turkey, improved, the, productivity, of, turkish, firms, a, 2017, paper, by, evans, and, fitzgerald, found, that, refugees, to, the, united, states, pay, 21, 000, more, in, taxes, than, they, receive, in, benefits, over, their, first, 20, years, in, the, u, s, an, internal, study, by, the, department, of, health, and, human, services, under, the, trump, administration, which, was, suppressed, and, not, shown, to, the, public, found, that, refugees, to, the, united, states, brought, in, 63, billion, more, in, government, revenues, than, they, cost, the, government, according, to, university, of, california, davis, labor, economist, giovanni, peri, the, existing, literature, suggests, that, there, are, no, economic, reasons, why, the, american, labor, market, could, not, easily, absorb, 100, 000, syrian, refugees, in, a, year, a, 2017, paper, looking, at, the, long, term, impact, of, refugees, on, the, american, labor, market, over, the, period, 1980, 2010, found, that, there, is, no, adverse, long, run, impact, of, refugees, on, the, u, s, labor, market, a, 2022, study, by, economist, michael, clemens, found, that, the, sharp, reduction, in, refugee, admissions, in, the, united, states, since, 2017, had, cost, the, u, s, economy, over, 9, 1, billion, per, year, and, cost, public, coffers, over, 2, billion, per, year, refugees, integrate, more, slowly, into, host, countries, labor, markets, than, labor, migrants, in, part, due, to, the, loss, and, depreciation, of, human, capital, and, credentials, during, the, asylum, procedure, refugees, tend, to, do, worse, in, economic, terms, than, natives, even, when, they, have, the, same, skills, and, language, proficiencies, of, natives, for, instance, a, 2013, study, of, germans, in, west, germany, who, had, been, displaced, from, eastern, europe, during, and, after, world, war, ii, showed, that, the, forced, german, migrants, did, far, worse, economically, than, their, native, west, german, counterparts, decades, later, second, generation, forced, german, migrants, also, did, worse, in, economic, terms, than, their, native, counterparts, a, study, of, refugees, to, the, united, states, found, that, refugees, that, enter, the, u, s, before, age, 14, graduate, high, school, and, enter, college, at, the, same, rate, as, natives, refugees, that, enter, as, older, teenagers, have, lower, attainment, with, much, of, the, difference, attributable, to, language, barriers, and, because, many, in, this, group, are, not, accompanied, by, a, parent, to, the, u, s, refugees, that, entered, the, u, s, at, ages, 18, 45, have, much, lower, levels, of, education, and, poorer, language, skills, than, natives, and, outcomes, are, initially, poor, with, low, employment, high, welfare, use, and, low, earnings, but, the, authors, of, the, study, find, that, outcomes, improve, considerably, as, refugees, age, a, 2017, study, found, that, the, 0, 5, million, portuguese, who, returned, to, portugal, from, mozambique, and, angola, in, the, mid, 1970s, lowered, labor, productivity, and, wages, a, 2018, paper, found, that, the, areas, in, greece, that, took, on, a, larger, share, of, greek, orthodox, refugees, from, the, greco, turkish, war, of, 1919, 1922, have, today, higher, earnings, higher, levels, of, household, wealth, greater, educational, attainment, as, well, as, larger, financial, and, manufacturing, sectors, research, on, the, economic, effects, of, undocumented, immigrants, is, scant, but, existing, studies, suggests, that, the, effects, are, positive, for, the, native, population, and, public, coffers, a, 2015, study, shows, that, increasing, deportation, rates, and, tightening, border, control, weakens, low, skilled, labor, markets, increasing, unemployment, of, native, low, skilled, workers, legalization, instead, decreases, the, unemployment, rate, of, low, skilled, natives, and, increases, income, per, native, studies, show, that, legalization, of, undocumented, immigrants, could, boost, the, u, s, economy, a, 2013, study, found, that, granting, legal, status, to, undocumented, immigrants, could, raise, their, incomes, by, a, quarter, increasing, u, s, gdp, by, approximately, 1, 4, trillion, over, a, ten, year, period, and, a, 2016, study, found, that, legalization, would, increase, the, economic, contribution, of, the, unauthorized, population, by, about, 20, to, 3, 6, of, private, sector, gdp, a, 2018, national, bureau, of, economic, research, paper, found, that, undocumented, immigrants, to, the, united, states, generate, higher, surplus, for, us, firms, relative, to, natives, hence, restricting, their, entry, has, a, depressing, effect, on, job, creation, and, in, turn, on, native, labor, markets, in, the, us, the, immigration, reform, and, control, act, was, passed, to, help, remove, the, illegal, aliens, they, were, trying, to, do, this, by, granting, legal, status, or, by, imposing, penalties, against, the, employers, who, would, knowingly, work, illegal, immigrants, however, irca, did, not, address, the, reality, or, price, which, caused, an, issue, in, the, accomplishing, of, the, objectives, a, 2017, study, in, the, journal, of, public, economics, found, that, more, intense, immigration, enforcement, increased, the, likelihood, that, us, born, children, with, undocumented, immigrant, parents, would, live, in, poverty, a, paper, by, spanish, economists, found, that, upon, legalizing, the, undocumented, immigrant, population, in, spain, the, fiscal, revenues, increased, by, around, 4, 189, per, newly, legalized, immigrant, the, paper, found, that, the, wages, of, the, newly, legalized, immigrants, increased, after, legalization, some, low, skilled, natives, had, worse, labor, market, outcomes, and, high, skilled, natives, had, improved, labor, market, outcomes, a, 2018, study, found, no, evidence, that, apprehensions, of, undocumented, immigrants, in, districts, in, the, united, states, improved, the, labor, market, outcomes, for, american, natives, a, 2020, study, found, that, immigration, enforcement, in, the, us, leads, to, declining, production, in, the, us, dairy, industry, and, that, dairy, operators, respond, to, immigration, enforcement, by, automating, their, operations, rather, than, hire, new, labor, a, 2021, study, in, the, american, economic, journal, found, that, undocumented, immigrants, had, beneficial, effects, on, the, employment, and, wages, of, american, natives, stricter, immigration, enforcement, adversely, affected, employment, and, wages, of, american, natives, research, suggests, that, migration, is, beneficial, both, to, the, receiving, and, sending, countries, according, to, one, study, welfare, increases, in, both, types, of, countries, welfare, impact, of, observed, levels, of, migration, is, substantial, at, about, 5, to, 10, for, the, main, receiving, countries, and, about, 10, in, countries, with, large, incoming, remittances, a, study, of, equivalent, workers, in, the, united, states, and, 42, developing, countries, found, that, median, wage, gap, for, a, male, unskilled, 9, years, of, schooling, 35, year, old, urban, formal, sector, worker, born, and, educated, in, a, developing, country, is, p, 15, 400, per, year, at, purchasing, power, parity, a, 2014, survey, of, the, existing, literature, on, emigration, finds, that, a, 10, percent, emigrant, supply, shock, would, increase, wages, in, the, sending, country, by, 2, 5, 5, remittances, increase, living, standards, in, the, country, of, origin, remittances, are, a, large, share, of, the, gdp, of, many, developing, countries, a, study, on, remittances, to, mexico, found, that, remittances, lead, to, a, substantial, increase, in, the, availability, of, public, services, in, mexico, surpassing, government, spending, in, some, localities, research, finds, that, emigration, and, low, migration, barriers, has, net, positive, effects, on, human, capital, formation, in, the, sending, countries, this, means, that, there, is, a, brain, gain, instead, of, a, brain, drain, to, emigration, emigration, has, also, been, linked, to, innovation, in, cases, where, the, migrants, return, to, their, home, country, after, developing, skills, abroad, one, study, finds, that, sending, countries, benefit, indirectly, in, the, long, run, on, the, emigration, of, skilled, workers, because, those, skilled, workers, are, able, to, innovate, more, in, developed, countries, which, the, sending, countries, are, able, to, benefit, on, as, a, positive, externality, greater, emigration, of, skilled, workers, consequently, leads, to, greater, economic, growth, and, welfare, improvements, in, the, long, run, the, negative, effects, of, high, skill, emigration, remain, largely, unfounded, according, to, economist, michael, clemens, it, has, not, been, shown, that, restrictions, on, high, skill, emigration, reduce, shortages, in, the, countries, of, origin, research, also, suggests, that, emigration, remittances, and, return, migration, can, have, a, positive, impact, on, political, institutions, and, democratization, in, the, country, of, origin, according, to, abel, escrib, folch, joseph, wright, and, covadonga, meseguer, remittances, provide, resources, that, make, political, opposition, possible, and, they, decrease, government, dependency, undermining, the, patronage, strategies, underpinning, authoritarianism, research, also, shows, that, remittances, can, lower, the, risk, of, civil, war, in, the, country, of, origin, research, suggests, that, emigration, causes, an, increase, in, the, wages, of, those, who, remain, in, the, country, of, origin, a, 2014, survey, of, the, existing, literature, on, emigration, finds, that, a, 10, percent, emigrant, supply, shock, would, increase, wages, in, the, sending, country, by, 2, 5, 5, a, study, of, emigration, from, poland, shows, that, it, led, to, a, slight, increase, in, wages, for, high, and, medium, skilled, workers, for, remaining, poles, a, 2013, study, finds, that, emigration, from, eastern, europe, after, the, 2004, eu, enlargement, increased, the, wages, of, remaining, young, workers, in, the, country, of, origin, by, 6, while, it, had, no, effect, on, the, wages, of, old, workers, the, wages, of, lithuanian, men, increased, as, a, result, of, post, eu, enlargement, emigration, return, migration, is, associated, with, greater, household, firm, revenues, emigration, leads, to, boosts, in, foreign, direct, investment, to, their, home, country, some, research, shows, that, the, remittance, effect, is, not, strong, enough, to, make, the, remaining, natives, in, countries, with, high, emigration, flows, better, off, a, 2017, survey, of, the, existing, economic, literature, found, that, high, skilled, migrants, boost, innovation, and, productivity, outcomes, according, to, a, 2013, survey, of, the, existing, economic, literature, much, of, the, existing, research, points, towards, positive, net, contributions, by, immigrant, entrepreneurs, areas, where, immigrant, are, more, prevalent, in, the, united, states, have, substantially, more, innovation, as, measured, by, patenting, and, citations, immigrants, to, the, united, states, create, businesses, at, higher, rates, than, natives, a, 2010, study, showed, that, a, 1, percentage, point, increase, in, immigrant, college, graduates, population, share, increases, patents, per, capita, by, 9, 18, percent, mass, migration, can, also, boost, innovation, and, growth, as, shown, by, the, jewish, huguenot, and, bohemian, diasporas, in, berlin, and, prussia, german, jewish, migr, s, in, the, us, the, mariel, boatlift, the, exodus, of, soviet, jews, to, israel, in, the, 1990s, european, migration, to, argentina, during, the, age, of, mass, migration, 1850, 1914, west, east, migration, in, the, wake, of, german, reunification, german, migration, to, russian, empire, and, polish, immigration, to, germany, after, joining, the, eu, a, 2018, study, in, the, economic, journal, found, that, a, 10, increase, in, immigration, from, exporters, of, a, given, product, is, associated, with, a, 2, increase, in, the, likelihood, that, the, host, country, starts, exporting, that, good, from, scratch, in, the, next, decade, immigrants, have, been, linked, to, greater, invention, and, innovation, according, to, one, report, immigrants, have, started, more, than, half, 44, of, 87, of, america, s, startup, companies, valued, at, 1, billion, dollars, or, more, and, are, key, members, of, management, or, product, development, teams, in, over, 70, percent, 62, of, 87, of, these, companies, one, analysis, found, that, immigrant, owned, firms, had, a, higher, innovation, rate, on, most, measures, of, innovation, than, firms, owned, by, u, s, born, entrepreneurs, research, also, shows, that, labor, migration, increases, human, capital, foreign, doctoral, students, are, a, major, source, of, innovation, in, the, american, economy, in, the, united, states, immigrant, workers, hold, a, disproportionate, share, of, jobs, in, science, technology, engineering, and, math, stem, in, 2013, foreign, born, workers, accounted, for, 19, 2, percent, of, stem, workers, with, a, bachelor, s, degree, 40, 7, percent, of, those, with, a, master, s, degree, and, more, than, half, 54, 5, percent, of, those, with, a, phd, a, number, of, countries, across, the, globe, offer, economic, citizenship, programs, where, in, return, for, investing, into, the, local, economy, foreign, investors, are, awarded, citizenship, such, programs, encourage, innovation, and, entrepreneurship, from, foreign, investors, and, high, net, worth, individuals, who, as, new, citizens, in, the, country, can, offer, unique, perspectives, st, kitts, and, nevis, was, the, first, country, to, offer, economic, citizenship, back, in, 1984, creating, a, new, market, for, citizenship, and, by, the, early, 2000s, other, caribbean, countries, joined, them, using, 130, years, of, data, on, historical, migrations, to, the, united, states, one, study, finds, that, a, doubling, of, the, number, of, residents, with, ancestry, from, a, given, foreign, country, relative, to, the, mean, increases, by, 4, 2, percentage, points, the, probability, that, at, least, one, local, firm, invests, in, that, country, and, increases, by, 31, the, number, of, employees, at, domestic, recipients, of, fdi, from, that, country, the, size, of, these, effects, increases, with, the, ethnic, diversity, of, the, local, population, the, geographic, distance, to, the, origin, country, and, the, ethno, linguistic, fractionalization, of, the, origin, country, a, 2017, study, found, that, immigrants, genetic, diversity, is, significantly, positively, correlated, with, measures, of, u, s, counties, economic, development, there, exists, also, a, significant, positive, relationship, between, immigrants, genetic, diversity, in, 1870, and, contemporaneous, measures, of, u, s, counties, average, income, some, research, suggests, that, immigration, can, offset, some, of, the, adverse, effects, of, automation, on, native, labor, outcomes, legislation, regarding, the, protection, of, rights, of, immigrants, and, equal, access, to, justice, differs, per, nation, international, law, the, product, of, the, united, nations, and, other, multinational, organizations, creates, protocols, governing, immigrant, rights, international, law, and, the, european, convention, of, human, rights, state, that, immigrants, can, only, be, detained, for, legitimate, aims, of, the, state, it, also, notes, that, vulnerable, people, should, be, protected, from, unreasonable, punishment, and, lengthy, detention, international, law, outlines, requirements, for, due, process, and, suitable, conditions, however, nations, are, sovereign, and, the, protocols, of, international, law, cannot, be, enforced, upon, them, nations, have, the, freedom, to, handle, immigrants, as, they, choose, and, to, structure, how, any, legal, aid, is, distributed, human, rights, organizations, strongly, criticize, individual, nation, states, for, the, limitations, of, their, immigration, policies, and, practices, treatment, of, migrants, in, host, countries, both, by, governments, employers, and, original, population, is, a, topic, of, continual, debate, and, criticism, and, the, violation, of, migrant, human, rights, is, an, ongoing, crisis, the, united, nations, convention, on, the, protection, of, the, rights, of, all, migrant, workers, and, members, of, their, families, has, been, ratified, by, 48, states, most, of, which, are, heavy, exporters, of, cheap, labor, major, migrant, receiving, countries, and, regions, including, western, europe, north, america, pacific, asia, australia, and, the, gulf, states, have, not, ratified, the, convention, even, though, they, are, host, to, the, majority, of, international, migrant, workers, although, freedom, of, movement, is, often, recognized, as, a, civil, right, in, many, documents, such, as, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, 1948, and, the, international, covenant, on, civil, and, political, rights, 1966, the, freedom, only, applies, to, movement, within, national, borders, and, the, ability, to, return, to, one, s, home, state, some, proponents, of, immigration, argue, that, the, freedom, of, movement, both, within, and, between, countries, is, a, basic, human, right, and, that, the, restrictive, immigration, policies, typical, of, nation, states, violate, this, human, right, of, freedom, of, movement, such, arguments, are, common, among, ideologies, like, anarchism, and, libertarianism, as, philosopher, and, open, borders, activist, jacob, appel, has, written, treating, human, beings, differently, simply, because, they, were, born, on, the, opposite, side, of, a, national, boundary, is, hard, to, justify, under, any, mainstream, philosophical, religious, or, ethical, theory, where, immigration, is, permitted, it, is, typically, selective, as, of, 2003, family, reunification, accounted, for, approximately, two, thirds, of, legal, immigration, to, the, us, every, year, ethnic, selection, such, as, the, white, australia, policy, has, generally, disappeared, but, priority, is, usually, given, to, the, educated, skilled, and, wealthy, less, privileged, individuals, including, the, mass, of, poor, people, in, low, income, countries, cannot, avail, themselves, of, the, legal, and, protected, immigration, opportunities, offered, by, wealthy, states, this, inequality, has, also, been, criticized, as, conflicting, with, the, principle, of, equal, opportunities, the, fact, that, the, door, is, closed, for, the, unskilled, while, at, the, same, time, many, developed, countries, have, a, huge, demand, for, unskilled, labor, is, a, major, factor, in, illegal, immigration, the, contradictory, nature, of, this, policy, which, specifically, disadvantages, the, unskilled, immigrants, while, exploiting, their, labor, has, also, been, criticized, on, ethical, grounds, immigration, policies, which, selectively, grant, freedom, of, movement, to, targeted, individuals, are, intended, to, produce, a, net, economic, gain, for, the, host, country, they, can, also, mean, net, loss, for, a, poor, donor, country, through, the, loss, of, the, educated, minority, a, brain, drain, this, can, exacerbate, the, global, inequality, in, standards, of, living, that, provided, the, motivation, for, the, individual, to, migrate, in, the, first, place, one, example, of, competition, for, skilled, labour, is, active, recruitment, of, health, workers, from, developing, countries, by, developed, countries, there, may, however, also, be, a, brain, gain, to, emigration, as, migration, opportunities, lead, to, greater, investments, in, education, in, developing, countries, overall, research, suggests, that, migration, is, beneficial, both, to, the, receiving, and, sending, countries, a, 2015, study, finds, some, evidence, that, larger, immigrant, population, shares, or, inflows, yield, positive, impacts, on, institutional, quality, at, a, minimum, our, results, indicate, that, no, negative, impact, on, economic, freedom, is, associated, with, more, immigration, another, study, looking, at, the, increase, in, israel, s, population, in, the, 1990s, due, to, the, unrestricted, immigration, of, jews, from, the, soviet, union, finds, that, the, mass, immigration, did, not, undermine, political, institutions, and, substantially, increased, the, quality, of, economic, institutions, a, 2017, study, in, the, british, journal, of, political, science, argued, that, the, british, american, colonies, without, slavery, adopted, better, democratic, institutions, in, order, to, attract, migrant, workers, to, their, colonies, a, 2018, study, fails, to, find, evidence, that, immigration, to, the, united, states, weakens, economic, freedom, a, 2019, study, of, jordan, found, that, the, massive, influx, of, refugees, into, jordan, during, the, gulf, war, had, long, lasting, positive, effects, on, jordanian, economic, institutions, some, research, has, found, that, as, immigration, and, ethnic, heterogeneity, increase, government, funding, of, welfare, and, public, support, for, welfare, decrease, ethnic, nepotism, may, be, an, explanation, for, this, phenomenon, other, possible, explanations, include, theories, regarding, in, group, and, out, group, effects, and, reciprocal, altruism, research, however, also, challenges, the, notion, that, ethnic, heterogeneity, reduces, public, goods, provision, studies, that, find, a, negative, relationship, between, ethnic, diversity, and, public, goods, provision, often, fail, to, take, into, account, that, strong, states, were, better, at, assimilating, minorities, thus, decreasing, diversity, in, the, long, run, ethnically, diverse, states, today, consequently, tend, to, be, weaker, states, because, most, of, the, evidence, on, fractionalization, comes, from, sub, saharan, africa, and, the, united, states, the, generalizability, of, the, findings, is, questionable, a, 2018, study, in, the, american, political, science, review, cast, doubts, on, findings, that, ethnoracial, homogeneity, led, to, greater, public, goods, provision, research, finds, that, americans, attitudes, towards, immigration, influence, their, attitudes, towards, welfare, spending, a, 2016, study, found, that, immigration, in, the, period, 1940, 2010, in, the, united, states, increased, the, high, school, completion, of, natives, an, increase, of, one, percentage, point, in, the, share, of, immigrants, in, the, population, aged, 11, 64, increases, the, probability, that, natives, aged, 11, 17, eventually, complete, 12, years, of, schooling, by, 0, 3, percentage, point, a, 2019, nber, paper, found, little, evidence, that, exposure, to, foreign, born, students, had, an, impact, on, us, born, students, studies, have, found, that, non, native, speakers, of, english, in, the, uk, have, no, causal, impact, on, the, performance, of, other, pupils, immigrant, children, have, no, significant, impact, on, the, test, scores, of, dutch, children, no, effect, on, grade, repetition, among, native, students, exposed, to, migrant, students, in, austrian, schools, that, the, presence, of, latin, american, children, in, schools, had, no, significant, negative, effects, on, peers, but, that, students, with, limited, english, skills, had, slight, negative, effects, on, peers, and, that, the, influx, of, haitians, to, florida, public, schools, after, the, 2010, haiti, earthquake, had, no, effects, on, the, educational, outcomes, of, incumbent, students, a, 2018, study, found, that, the, presence, of, immigrant, students, who, have, been, in, the, country, for, some, time, is, found, to, have, no, effect, on, natives, however, a, small, negative, effect, of, recent, immigrants, on, natives, language, scores, is, reported, another, 2018, study, found, that, the, presence, of, immigrant, students, to, italy, was, associated, with, small, negative, average, effects, on, maths, test, scores, that, are, larger, for, low, ability, native, students, strongly, non, linear, and, only, observable, in, classes, with, a, high, top, 20, immigrant, concentration, these, outcomes, are, driven, by, classes, with, a, high, average, linguistic, distance, between, immigrants, and, natives, with, no, apparent, additional, role, played, by, ethnic, diversity, after, immigrant, children, s, scores, were, included, in, programme, for, international, student, assessment, pisa, 15, year, old, school, pupils, educational, evaluations, in, sweden, the, swedish, pisa, scores, significantly, decreased, there, is, some, research, that, suggests, that, immigration, adversely, affects, social, capital, one, study, for, instance, found, that, larger, increases, in, us, states, mexican, population, shares, correspond, to, larger, decreases, in, social, capital, over, the, period, 1986, 2004, a, 2017, study, in, the, journal, of, comparative, economics, found, that, individuals, whose, ancestors, migrated, from, countries, with, higher, autocracy, levels, are, less, likely, to, trust, others, and, to, vote, in, presidential, elections, in, the, u, s, the, impact, of, autocratic, culture, on, trust, can, last, for, at, least, three, generations, while, the, impact, on, voting, disappears, after, one, generation, these, impacts, on, trust, and, voting, are, also, significant, across, europe, a, 2019, study, found, that, humans, are, inclined, to, react, negatively, to, threats, to, homogeneity, in, the, short, term, however, these, negative, outcomes, are, compensated, in, the, long, term, by, the, beneficial, influence, of, intergroup, contact, which, alleviates, initial, negative, influences, research, suggests, that, immigration, has, positive, effects, on, native, workers, health, as, immigration, rises, native, workers, are, pushed, into, less, demanding, jobs, which, improves, native, workers, health, outcomes, a, 2018, study, found, that, immigration, to, the, united, kingdom, reduced, waiting, times, for, outpatient, referrals, and, did, not, have, significant, effects, on, waiting, times, in, accident, and, emergency, departments, a, e, and, elective, care, the, study, also, found, evidence, that, immigration, increased, waiting, times, for, outpatient, referrals, in, more, deprived, areas, outside, of, london, but, that, this, increase, disappears, after, 3, to, 4, years, a, 2018, systemic, review, and, meta, analysis, in, the, lancet, found, that, migrants, generally, have, better, health, than, the, general, population, in, the, eu, the, use, of, personal, health, records, for, migrants, is, being, tested, in, the, new, rehealth, 2, project, high, immigration, can, cause, higher, stress, on, highly, regulated, sectors, such, as, healthcare, education, and, housing, leading, to, negative, effects, immigration, tends, to, increase, both, local, rents, and, house, prices, but, this, dependency, varies, depending, on, factors, including, price, elasticity, of, new, housing, supply, socioeconomics, of, immigrants, and, internal, migration, of, natives, immigration, and, crime, explores, whether, there, is, a, relationship, between, criminal, activity, and, the, phenomenon, of, immigration, research, suggests, that, people, overestimate, the, impact, of, immigration, on, crime, in, part, due, to, sensational, media, coverage, or, narratives, pushed, by, politicians, this, fear, of, crime, can, lead, to, increases, in, hate, crimes, against, immigrants, as, well, as, harsher, immigration, policies, like, family, separation, most, studies, show, that, immigration, has, either, no, or, minimal, impact, on, crime, in, most, countries, bogus, recruitment, agencies, and, rogue, recruitment, agencies, make, fake, promises, of, better, opportunities, education, income, some, of, the, abuses, and, crimes, experienced, by, immigrants, are, the, followed, in, many, countries, there, is, a, lack, of, prosecution, of, this, crimes, since, these, countries, obtain, benefits, and, taxes, paid, by, these, companies, that, benefit, the, economies, and, also, because, of, the, current, shortage, of, workers, a, 2019, review, of, existing, research, in, the, annual, review, of, sociology, on, immigrant, assimilation, in, the, united, states, the, united, kingdom, france, germany, sweden, norway, belgium, the, netherlands, and, spain, concluded, we, find, an, overall, pattern, of, intergenerational, assimilation, in, terms, of, socioeconomic, attainment, social, relations, and, cultural, beliefs, return, migration, from, countries, with, liberal, gender, norms, has, been, associated, with, the, transfer, of, liberal, gender, norms, to, the, home, country, a, 2018, study, in, the, american, sociological, review, found, that, within, racial, groups, most, immigrants, to, the, united, states, had, fully, assimilated, within, a, span, of, 20, years, immigrants, arriving, in, the, united, states, after, 1994, assimilate, more, rapidly, than, immigrants, who, arrived, in, previous, periods, measuring, assimilation, can, be, difficult, due, to, ethnic, attrition, which, refers, to, when, descendants, of, migrants, cease, to, self, identify, with, the, nationality, or, ethnicity, of, their, ancestors, this, means, that, successful, cases, of, assimilation, will, be, underestimated, research, shows, that, ethnic, attrition, is, sizable, in, hispanic, and, asian, immigrant, groups, in, the, united, states, by, taking, account, of, ethnic, attrition, the, assimilation, rate, of, hispanics, in, the, united, states, improves, significantly, a, 2016, paper, challenges, the, view, that, cultural, differences, are, necessarily, an, obstacle, to, long, run, economic, performance, of, migrants, it, finds, that, first, generation, migrants, seem, to, be, less, likely, to, success, the, more, culturally, distant, they, are, but, this, effect, vanishes, as, time, spent, in, the, us, increases, a, 2018, study, found, that, chinese, nationals, in, the, united, states, who, received, permanent, residency, permits, from, the, us, government, amid, the, tiananmen, square, protests, and, subsequent, chinese, government, clampdown, experienced, significant, employment, and, earnings, gains, relative, to, similar, immigrant, groups, who, did, not, have, the, same, residency, rights, during, the, age, of, mass, migration, infant, arrivals, to, the, united, states, had, greater, economic, success, over, their, lifetime, than, teenage, arrivals, a, 2015, report, by, the, national, institute, of, demographic, studies, finds, that, an, overwhelming, majority, of, second, generation, immigrants, of, all, origins, in, france, feel, french, despite, the, persistent, discrimination, in, education, housing, and, employment, that, many, of, the, minorities, face, research, shows, that, country, of, origin, matters, for, speed, and, depth, of, immigrant, assimilation, but, that, there, is, considerable, assimilation, overall, research, finds, that, first, generation, immigrants, from, countries, with, less, egalitarian, gender, cultures, adopt, gender, values, more, similar, to, natives, over, time, according, to, one, study, this, acculturation, process, is, almost, completed, within, one, generational, succession, the, gender, attitudes, of, second, generation, immigrants, are, difficult, to, distinguish, from, the, attitudes, of, members, of, mainstream, society, this, holds, also, for, children, born, to, immigrants, from, very, gender, traditional, cultures, and, for, children, born, to, less, well, integrated, immigrant, families, similar, results, are, found, on, a, study, of, turkish, migrants, to, western, europe, the, assimilation, on, gender, attitudes, has, been, observed, in, education, as, one, study, finds, that, the, female, advantage, in, education, observed, among, the, majority, population, is, usually, present, among, second, generation, immigrants, a, 2017, study, of, switzerland, found, that, naturalization, strongly, improves, long, term, social, integration, of, immigrants, the, integration, returns, to, naturalization, are, larger, for, more, marginalized, immigrant, groups, and, when, naturalization, occurs, earlier, rather, than, later, in, the, residency, period, a, separate, study, of, switzerland, found, that, naturalization, improved, the, economic, integration, of, immigrants, winning, swiss, citizenship, in, the, referendum, increased, annual, earnings, by, an, average, of, approximately, 5, 000, u, s, dollars, over, the, subsequent, 15, years, this, effect, is, concentrated, among, more, marginalized, immigrants, first, generation, immigrants, tend, to, hold, less, accepting, views, of, homosexuality, but, opposition, weakens, with, longer, stays, second, generation, immigrants, are, overall, more, accepting, of, homosexuality, but, the, acculturation, effect, is, weaker, for, muslims, and, to, some, extent, eastern, orthodox, migrants, a, study, of, bangladeshi, migrants, in, east, london, found, they, shifted, towards, the, thinking, styles, of, the, wider, non, migrant, population, in, just, a, single, generation, a, study, on, germany, found, that, foreign, born, parents, are, more, likely, to, integrate, if, their, children, are, entitled, to, german, citizenship, at, birth, a, 2017, study, found, that, faster, access, to, citizenship, improves, the, economic, situation, of, immigrant, women, especially, their, labour, market, attachment, with, higher, employment, rates, longer, working, hours, and, more, stable, jobs, immigrants, also, invest, more, in, host, country, specific, skills, like, language, and, vocational, training, faster, access, to, citizenship, seems, a, powerful, policy, instrument, to, boost, economic, integration, in, countries, with, traditionally, restrictive, citizenship, policies, naturalization, is, associated, with, large, and, persistent, wage, gains, for, the, naturalized, citizens, in, most, countries, one, study, of, denmark, found, that, providing, immigrants, with, voting, rights, reduced, their, crime, rate, studies, on, programs, that, randomly, allocate, refugee, immigrants, across, municipalities, find, that, the, assignment, of, neighborhood, impacts, immigrant, crime, propensity, education, and, earnings, a, 2019, study, found, that, refugees, who, resettled, in, areas, with, many, conationals, were, more, likely, to, be, economically, integrated, research, suggests, that, bilingual, schooling, reduces, barriers, between, speakers, from, two, different, communities, research, suggests, that, a, vicious, cycle, of, bigotry, and, isolation, could, reduce, assimilation, and, increase, bigotry, towards, immigrants, in, the, long, term, for, instance, university, of, california, san, diego, political, scientist, claire, adida, stanford, university, political, scientist, david, laitin, and, sorbonne, university, economist, marie, anne, valfort, argue, fear, based, policies, that, target, groups, of, people, according, to, their, religion, or, region, of, origin, are, counter, productive, our, own, research, which, explains, the, failed, integration, of, muslim, immigrants, in, france, suggests, that, such, policies, can, feed, into, a, vicious, cycle, that, damages, national, security, french, islamophobia, a, response, to, cultural, difference, has, encouraged, muslim, immigrants, to, withdraw, from, french, society, which, then, feeds, back, into, french, islamophobia, thus, further, exacerbating, muslims, alienation, and, so, on, indeed, the, failure, of, french, security, in, 2015, was, likely, due, to, police, tactics, that, intimidated, rather, than, welcomed, the, children, of, immigrants, an, approach, that, makes, it, hard, to, obtain, crucial, information, from, community, members, about, potential, threats, a, study, which, examined, catalan, nationalism, examined, the, catalan, government, s, policy, towards, the, integration, of, immigrants, during, the, start, of, the, 1990s, at, this, time, the, spanish, region, of, catalonia, was, experiencing, a, large, influx, in, the, number, of, immigrants, from, northern, africa, latin, america, and, asia, the, spanish, government, paid, little, attention, to, this, influx, of, immigrants, however, catalan, politicians, began, discussing, how, the, increase, in, immigrants, would, effect, catalan, identity, members, of, the, catalan, parliament, petitioned, for, a, plan, to, integrate, these, immigrants, into, catalan, society, crucially, the, plan, did, not, include, policies, regarding, naturalisation, which, were, key, immigration, policies, of, the, spanish, government, the, plan, of, the, catalan, parliament, aimed, to, create, a, shared, catalan, identity, which, included, both, the, native, catalan, population, and, immigrant, communities, this, meant, that, immigrants, were, encouraged, to, relate, as, part, of, the, catalan, community, but, also, encouraged, to, retain, their, own, culture, and, traditions, in, this, way, assimilation, of, immigrant, cultures, in, catalonia, was, avoided, a, 2018, study, in, the, british, journal, of, political, science, found, that, immigrants, in, norway, became, more, politically, engaged, the, earlier, that, they, were, given, voting, rights, a, 2019, study, in, the, european, economic, review, found, that, language, training, improved, the, economic, assimilation, of, immigrants, in, france, a, 2020, study, using, data, from, large, scale, comparative, surveys, in, germany, france, and, united, kingdom, found, that, sampled, households, with, a, language, barrier, tend, to, have, poor, living, conditions, and, are, migrants, inferences, about, their, demographic, attitudinal, or, behavioral, traits, cannot, be, made, because, the, ability, to, speak, the, official, language, s, of, the, country, is, one, of, the, criteria, for, survey, participation, a, 2020, paper, on, reforms, of, refugee, policy, in, denmark, found, that, language, training, boosted, the, economic, and, social, integration, of, refugees, whereas, cuts, to, refugees, welfare, benefits, had, no, impact, except, to, temporarily, increase, property, crimes, research, suggests, that, police, practices, such, as, racial, profiling, over, policing, in, areas, populated, by, minorities, and, in, group, bias, may, result, in, disproportionately, high, numbers, of, racial, minorities, among, crime, suspects, in, sweden, italy, and, england, and, wales, research, also, suggests, that, there, may, be, possible, discrimination, by, the, judicial, system, which, contributes, to, a, higher, number, of, convictions, for, racial, minorities, in, sweden, the, netherlands, italy, germany, denmark, and, france, a, 2018, study, found, that, the, dutch, are, less, likely, to, reciprocate, in, games, played, with, immigrants, than, the, native, dutch, several, meta, analyses, find, extensive, evidence, of, ethnic, and, racial, discrimination, in, hiring, in, the, north, american, and, european, labor, markets, a, 2016, meta, analysis, of, 738, correspondence, tests, in, 43, separate, studies, conducted, in, oecd, countries, between, 1990, and, 2015, finds, that, there, is,

interview, than, majority, candidates, a, 2014, meta, analysis, found, extensive, evidence, of, racial, and, ethnic, discrimination, in, the, housing, market, of, several, european, countries, since, 2010, the, united, kingdom, s, policies, surrounding, immigrant, detention, have, come, under, fire, for, insufficiently, protecting, vulnerable, groups, in, the, early, 2000s, the, united, kingdom, adopted, the, detention, duty, advice, dda, scheme, in, order, to, provide, free, government, funded, legal, aid, to, immigrants, the, dda, scheme, at, face, value, granted, liberty, on, administrative, grounds, by, considering, immigrant, merits, nature, of, their, work, their, financial, means, and, other, factors, that, would, then, determine, how, much, free, legal, aid, detainees, were, granted, recent, research, by, the, organization, for, economic, cooperation, and, development, oecd, demonstrates, that, marginalized, groups, have, been, barred, from, legal, assistance, in, detention, centers, the, barriers, immigrants, face, in, order, to, access, justice, through, the, dda, disproportionately, impacted, underrepresented, groups, of, immigrants, and, the, language, barrier, and, lack, of, interpreters, led, to, further, hurdles, that, detainees, were, unable, to, jump, through, in, canada, immigrant, detainees, face, barriers, to, justice, due, to, a, lack, of, international, enforcement, canada, s, immigration, detention, system, has, significant, legal, and, normative, problems, and, the, rubric, of, access, to, justice, that, is, presented, by, international, law, fails, to, identify, these, faults, there, is, a, lack, of, access, to, legal, aid, for, immigrants, in, detention, as, well, as, inhumane, treatment, in, detention, centers, research, has, demonstrated, irreparable, psychological, physical, and, social, damage, to, immigrants, and, the, international, community, ignores, these, injustices, a, 2014, meta, analysis, of, racial, discrimination, in, product, markets, found, extensive, evidence, of, minority, applicants, being, quoted, higher, prices, for, products, a, 1995, study, found, that, car, dealers, quoted, significantly, lower, prices, to, white, males, than, to, black, or, female, test, buyers, using, identical, scripted, bargaining, strategies, a, 2013, study, found, that, ebay, sellers, of, ipods, received, 21, percent, more, offers, if, a, white, hand, held, the, ipod, in, the, photo, than, a, black, hand, research, suggests, that, police, practices, such, as, racial, profiling, over, policing, in, areas, populated, by, minorities, and, in, group, bias, may, result, in, disproportionately, high, numbers, of, racial, minorities, among, crime, suspects, research, also, suggests, that, there, may, be, possible, discrimination, by, the, judicial, system, which, contributes, to, a, higher, number, of, convictions, for, racial, minorities, a, 2012, study, found, that, i, juries, formed, from, all, white, jury, pools, convict, black, defendants, significantly, 16, percentage, points, more, often, than, white, defendants, and, ii, this, gap, in, conviction, rates, is, entirely, eliminated, when, the, jury, pool, includes, at, least, one, black, member, research, has, found, evidence, of, in, group, bias, where, black, white, juveniles, who, are, randomly, assigned, to, black, white, judges, are, more, likely, to, get, incarcerated, as, opposed, to, being, placed, on, probation, and, they, receive, longer, sentences, in, group, bias, has, also, been, observed, when, it, comes, to, traffic, citations, as, black, and, white, cops, are, more, likely, to, cite, out, groups, a, 2015, study, using, correspondence, tests, found, that, when, considering, requests, from, prospective, students, seeking, mentoring, in, the, future, faculty, were, significantly, more, responsive, to, white, males, than, to, all, other, categories, of, students, collectively, particularly, in, higher, paying, disciplines, and, private, institutions, according, to, an, analysis, of, the, national, study, of, college, experience, elite, colleges, may, favor, minority, applicants, due, to, affirmative, action, policies, a, 2018, national, bureau, of, economic, research, paper, found, that, math, teachers, discriminate, against, the, children, of, immigrants, when, the, teachers, were, informed, about, negative, stereotypes, towards, the, children, of, immigrants, they, gave, higher, grades, to, the, children, of, immigrants, as, of, 2020, 2,
