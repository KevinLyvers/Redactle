public, administration, or, public, policy, and, administration, refers, to, the, management, of, public, programs, or, the, translation, of, politics, into, the, reality, that, citizens, see, every, day, and, also, to, the, academic, discipline, which, studies, how, public, policy, is, created, and, implemented, in, an, academic, context, public, administration, has, been, described, as, the, study, of, government, decision, making, the, analysis, of, policies, and, the, various, inputs, that, have, produced, them, and, the, inputs, necessary, to, produce, alternative, policies, it, is, also, a, subfield, of, political, science, where, studies, of, policy, processes, and, the, structures, functions, and, behavior, of, public, institutions, and, their, relationships, with, broader, society, take, place, the, study, and, application, of, public, administration, is, founded, on, the, principle, that, the, proper, functioning, of, an, organization, or, institution, relies, on, effective, management, the, mid, twentieth, century, saw, the, rise, of, german, sociologist, max, weber, s, theory, of, bureaucracy, bringing, about, a, substantive, interest, in, the, theoretical, aspects, of, public, administration, the, 1968, minnowbrook, conference, which, convened, at, syracuse, university, under, the, leadership, of, dwight, waldo, gave, rise, to, the, concept, of, new, public, administration, a, pivotal, movement, within, the, discipline, today, public, administration, encompasses, the, execution, oversight, and, management, of, government, policies, and, the, management, of, public, affairs, the, field, involves, the, organization, operation, and, strategic, coordination, of, bureaucratic, structures, in, the, public, sector, public, administrators, play, a, significant, role, in, devising, and, executing, policies, managing, shared, resources, and, ensuring, the, efficient, functioning, of, government, agencies, and, programs, in, 1947, paul, h, appleby, defined, public, administration, as, the, public, leadership, of, public, affairs, directly, responsible, for, executive, action, in, democracies, it, usually, has, to, do, with, such, leadership, and, executive, action, in, terms, that, respect, and, contribute, to, the, dignity, worth, and, potential, of, the, citizen, one, year, later, gordon, clapp, then, chairman, of, the, tennessee, valley, authority, defined, public, administration, as, a, public, instrument, whereby, democratic, society, may, be, more, completely, realized, this, implies, that, it, must, relate, itself, to, concepts, of, justice, liberty, and, fuller, economic, opportunity, for, human, beings, and, is, thus, concerned, with, people, with, ideas, and, with, things, james, d, carroll, and, alfred, m, zuck, called, woodrow, wilson, s, publication, of, his, essay, the, study, of, administration, the, beginning, of, public, administration, as, a, specific, and, influential, field, of, study, more, recently, scholars, claim, that, public, administration, has, no, generally, accepted, definition, because, the, scope, of, the, subject, is, so, great, and, so, debatable, that, it, is, easier, to, explain, than, define, public, administration, is, a, field, of, study, i, e, a, discipline, and, an, occupation, there, is, much, disagreement, about, whether, the, study, of, public, administration, can, properly, be, called, a, discipline, largely, because, of, the, debate, over, whether, public, administration, is, a, sub, field, of, political, science, or, a, sub, field, of, administrative, science, the, latter, an, outgrowth, of, its, roots, in, policy, analysis, and, evaluation, research, scholar, donald, f, kettl, is, among, those, who, view, public, administration, as, a, sub, field, within, political, science, according, to, lalor, a, society, with, a, public, authority, that, provides, at, least, one, public, good, can, be, said, to, have, a, public, administration, whereas, the, absence, of, either, or, a, fortiori, both, a, public, authority, or, the, provision, of, at, least, one, public, good, implies, the, absence, of, a, public, administration, he, argues, that, public, administration, is, the, public, provision, of, public, goods, in, which, the, demand, function, is, satisfied, more, or, less, effectively, by, politics, whose, primary, tool, is, rhetoric, providing, for, public, goods, and, the, supply, function, is, satisfied, more, or, less, efficiently, by, public, management, whose, primary, tools, are, speech, acts, producing, public, goods, the, moral, purpose, of, public, administration, implicit, in, its, acceptance, of, its, role, is, the, maximization, of, the, opportunities, of, the, public, to, satisfy, its, wants, the, north, american, industry, classification, system, definition, of, the, public, administration, sector, naics, 91, states, that, public, administration, comprises, establishments, primarily, engaged, in, activities, of, a, governmental, nature, that, is, the, enactment, and, judicial, interpretation, of, laws, and, their, pursuant, regulations, and, the, administration, of, programs, based, on, them, this, includes, legislative, activities, taxation, national, defense, public, order, and, safety, immigration, services, foreign, affairs, and, international, assistance, and, the, administration, of, government, programs, are, activities, that, are, purely, governmental, in, nature, the, harappa, and, mohenjo, daro, civilizations, had, organized, bodies, of, public, servants, suggesting, the, presence, of, some, form, of, public, administration, numerous, references, exist, to, brihaspati, s, contributions, to, laws, and, governance, an, excerpt, from, ain, i, akbari, written, by, abul, fazl, mentions, a, symposium, of, philosophers, from, various, faiths, held, in, 1578, at, akbar, s, instance, it, is, believed, that, some, charvaka, thinkers, may, have, participated, in, the, symposium, in, naastika, fazl, refers, to, the, charvaka, law, makers, emphasizing, good, work, judicious, administration, and, welfare, schemes, somadeva, also, describes, the, charvaka, method, of, defeating, the, nation, s, enemies, referring, to, thirteen, disguised, enemies, in, the, kingdom, with, selfish, interests, who, should, not, be, spared, kautilya, presents, a, detailed, scheme, to, remove, the, enemies, in, the, guise, of, friends, the, charvaka, stalwart, brihaspati, is, more, ancient, than, kautilya, and, somadeva, he, appears, to, be, contemporaneous, with, the, harappa, and, mohenjo, daro, cultures, archaeological, evidence, regarding, kings, priests, and, palaces, in, the, harappa, and, mohenjo, daro, excavations, is, limited, however, the, presence, of, complex, civilization, and, public, facilities, such, as, granaries, and, bathhouses, along, with, the, existence, of, large, cities, indicates, the, likelihood, of, centralized, governance, the, uniformity, in, the, artifacts, and, brick, sizes, suggests, that, there, was, some, form, of, centralized, governance, although, speculation, regarding, social, hierarchies, and, class, structures, is, plausible, the, absence, of, discernible, elite, burial, sites, also, suggests, that, most, citizens, were, almost, equal, in, status, dating, back, to, antiquity, states, have, required, officials, like, pages, treasurers, and, tax, collectors, to, administer, the, practical, business, of, government, before, the, 19th, century, the, staffing, of, most, public, administrations, was, rife, with, nepotism, favoritism, and, political, patronage, which, was, often, referred, to, as, a, spoils, system, public, administrators, have, long, been, the, eyes, and, ears, of, rulers, in, medieval, times, the, abilities, to, read, and, write, as, well, as, add, and, subtract, were, as, dominated, by, the, educated, elite, as, public, employment, consequently, the, need, for, expert, civil, servants, whose, ability, to, read, and, write, formed, the, basis, for, developing, expertise, in, such, necessary, activities, as, legal, record, keeping, paying, and, feeding, armies, and, levying, taxes, as, the, european, imperialist, age, progressed, and, the, military, powers, extended, their, hold, over, other, continents, and, people, the, need, for, a, sophisticated, public, administration, grew, the, field, of, management, may, have, originated, in, ancient, china, including, possibly, the, first, highly, centralized, bureaucratic, state, and, the, earliest, by, the, second, century, bc, example, of, an, meritocracy, based, on, civil, service, tests, in, regards, to, public, administration, china, was, considered, to, be, advanced, compared, to, the, rest, of, the, world, up, until, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, thomas, taylor, meadows, the, british, consul, in, guangzhou, argued, in, his, desultory, notes, on, the, government, and, people, of, china, 1847, that, the, long, duration, of, the, chinese, empire, is, solely, and, altogether, owing, to, the, good, government, which, consists, in, the, advancement, of, men, of, talent, and, merit, only, influenced, by, the, ancient, chinese, imperial, examination, the, northcote, trevelyan, report, of, 1854, recommended, that, recruitment, should, be, on, the, basis, of, merit, determined, through, competitive, examination, candidates, should, have, a, solid, general, education, to, enable, inter, departmental, transfers, and, promotion, should, be, through, achievement, rather, than, preferment, patronage, or, purchase, this, led, to, implementation, of, her, majesty, s, civil, service, as, a, systematic, meritocratic, civil, service, bureaucracy, like, the, british, the, development, of, french, bureaucracy, was, influenced, by, the, chinese, system, voltaire, claimed, that, the, chinese, had, perfected, moral, science, and, fran, ois, quesnay, advocated, an, economic, and, political, system, modeled, after, that, of, the, chinese, french, civil, service, examinations, adopted, in, the, late, 19th, century, were, also, heavily, based, on, general, cultural, studies, these, features, have, been, likened, to, the, earlier, chinese, model, though, chinese, administration, cannot, be, traced, to, any, one, individual, figures, of, the, fa, jia, emphasizing, a, merit, system, like, shen, buhai, 400, 337, bc, may, have, had, the, most, influence, and, could, be, considered, its, founders, if, they, are, not, valuable, as, rare, pre, modern, examples, of, the, abstract, theory, of, administration, creel, writes, that, in, shen, buhai, there, are, the, seeds, of, the, civil, service, examination, and, that, if, one, wishes, to, exaggerate, it, would, no, doubt, be, possible, to, translate, shen, buhai, s, term, shu, or, technique, as, science, and, argue, that, he, was, the, first, political, scientist, though, creel, does, not, care, to, go, this, far, in, the, 18th, century, king, frederick, william, i, of, prussia, created, professoriates, in, cameralism, in, order, to, train, a, new, class, of, public, administrators, the, universities, of, frankfurt, an, der, oder, and, the, university, of, halle, were, prussian, institutions, emphasizing, economic, and, social, disciplines, with, the, goal, of, societal, reform, johann, heinrich, gottlob, justi, was, a, well, known, professor, of, cameralism, lorenz, von, stein, an, 1855, german, professor, from, vienna, is, considered, the, founder, of, the, science, of, public, administration, in, many, parts, of, the, world, in, the, time, of, von, stein, public, administration, was, considered, a, form, of, administrative, law, but, von, stein, believed, this, concept, was, too, restrictive, von, stein, taught, that, public, administration, relies, on, many, pre, established, disciplines, such, as, sociology, political, science, administrative, law, and, public, finance, he, called, public, administration, an, integrating, science, and, stated, that, public, administrators, should, be, concerned, with, both, theory, and, practice, he, argued, that, public, administration, is, a, science, because, knowledge, is, generated, and, evaluated, according, to, the, scientific, method, the, father, of, public, administration, in, the, us, is, considered, to, be, woodrow, wilson, he, first, formally, recognized, public, administration, in, an, 1887, article, entitled, the, study, of, administration, the, future, president, wrote, that, it, is, the, object, of, administrative, study, to, discover, first, what, government, can, properly, and, successfully, do, and, secondly, how, it, can, do, these, proper, things, with, the, utmost, possible, efficiency, and, at, the, least, possible, cost, either, of, money, or, energy, by, the, 1920s, scholars, of, public, administration, had, responded, to, wilson, s, solicitation, and, textbooks, in, this, field, were, introduced, distinguished, scholars, of, that, period, include, luther, gulick, lyndall, urwick, henri, fayol, and, frederick, taylor, taylor, argued, in, the, principles, of, scientific, management, that, scientific, analysis, would, lead, to, the, discovery, of, the, best, way, to, do, things, or, carry, out, an, operation, taylor, s, technique, was, introduced, to, private, industrialists, and, later, to, various, government, organizations, the, american, society, for, public, administration, aspa, the, leading, professional, group, for, public, administration, was, founded, in, 1939, aspa, sponsors, the, journal, public, administration, review, which, was, founded, in, 1940, the, separation, of, politics, and, administration, advocated, by, wilson, continues, to, play, a, significant, role, in, public, administration, today, however, the, dominance, of, this, dichotomy, was, challenged, by, second, generation, scholars, beginning, in, the, 1940s, luther, gulick, s, fact, value, dichotomy, was, a, key, contender, for, wilson, s, proposed, politics, administration, dichotomy, in, place, of, wilson, s, first, generation, split, gulick, advocated, a, seamless, web, of, discretion, and, interaction, luther, gulick, and, lyndall, urwick, are, two, second, generation, scholars, gulick, urwick, and, the, new, generation, of, administrators, built, on, the, work, of, contemporary, behavioral, administrative, and, organizational, scholars, including, henri, fayol, fredrick, winslow, taylor, paul, appleby, frank, goodnow, and, willam, willoughby, the, new, generation, of, organizational, theories, no, longer, relied, upon, logical, assumptions, and, generalizations, about, human, nature, like, classical, and, enlightened, theorists, gulick, developed, a, comprehensive, generic, theory, of, organization, that, emphasized, the, scientific, method, efficiency, professionalism, structural, reform, and, executive, control, gulick, summarized, the, duties, of, administrators, with, an, acronym, posdcorb, which, stands, for, planning, organizing, staffing, directing, coordinating, reporting, and, budgeting, fayol, developed, a, systematic, 14, point, treatment, of, private, management, second, generation, theorists, drew, upon, private, management, practices, for, administrative, sciences, a, single, generic, management, theory, bleeding, the, borders, between, the, private, and, the, public, sector, was, thought, to, be, possible, with, the, general, theory, the, administrative, theory, could, be, focused, on, governmental, organizations, the, mid, 1940s, theorists, challenged, wilson, and, gulick, the, politics, administration, dichotomy, remained, the, center, of, criticism, during, the, 1950s, the, united, states, experienced, prolonged, prosperity, and, solidified, its, place, as, a, world, leader, public, administration, experienced, a, kind, of, heyday, due, to, the, successful, war, effort, and, successful, post, war, reconstruction, in, western, europe, and, japan, government, was, popular, as, was, president, eisenhower, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, the, government, itself, came, under, fire, as, ineffective, inefficient, and, largely, a, wasted, effort, the, costly, american, intervention, in, vietnam, along, with, domestic, scandals, including, the, bugging, of, democratic, party, headquarters, the, 1974, watergate, scandal, are, two, examples, of, self, destructive, government, behavior, that, alienated, citizens, there, was, a, call, by, citizens, for, efficient, administration, to, replace, ineffective, wasteful, bureaucracy, public, administration, would, have, to, distance, itself, from, politics, to, answer, this, call, and, remain, effective, elected, officials, supported, these, reforms, the, hoover, commission, chaired, by, university, of, chicago, professor, louis, brownlow, examines, the, reorganization, of, government, brownlow, subsequently, founded, the, public, administration, service, pas, at, the, university, an, organization, that, provided, consulting, services, to, all, levels, of, government, until, the, 1970s, concurrently, after, world, war, ii, the, entire, concept, of, public, administration, expanded, to, include, policymaking, and, analysis, thus, the, study, of, administrative, policy, making, and, analysis, was, introduced, and, enhanced, into, the, government, decision, making, bodies, later, on, the, human, factor, became, a, predominant, concern, and, emphasis, in, the, study, of, public, administration, this, period, witnessed, the, development, and, inclusion, of, other, social, sciences, knowledge, predominantly, psychology, anthropology, and, sociology, into, the, study, of, public, administration, jeong, 2007, henceforth, the, emergence, of, scholars, such, as, fritz, morstein, marx, with, his, book, the, elements, of, public, administration, 1946, paul, h, appleby, policy, and, administration, 1952, frank, marini, towards, a, new, public, administration, 1971, and, others, that, have, contributed, positively, in, these, endeavors, stimulated, by, events, during, the, 1960s, such, as, an, active, civil, rights, movement, the, vietnam, war, and, war, protests, assassinations, of, a, president, and, civil, rights, leaders, and, an, active, women, s, movement, public, administration, changed, course, somewhat, landmark, legislation, such, as, the, equal, pay, act, of, 1963, and, the, civil, rights, act, of, 1964, also, gave, public, administrators, new, responsibilities, these, events, were, manifest, in, the, public, administration, profession, through, the, new, public, administration, movement, under, the, stimulating, patronage, of, dwight, waldo, some, of, the, best, of, the, younger, generation, of, scholars, challenged, the, doctrine, they, had, received, these, new, scholars, demanded, more, policy, oriented, public, administrators, that, incorporated, four, themes, relevance, values, equity, and, change, all, of, these, themes, would, encourage, more, participation, among, women, and, minorities, stimulated, by, the, events, of, the, 60s, the, 1970s, brought, significant, change, to, the, american, society, for, public, administration, racial, and, ethnic, minorities, and, women, members, organized, to, seek, greater, participation, eventually, the, conference, on, minority, public, administrators, and, the, section, for, women, in, public, administration, were, established, in, the, late, 1980s, yet, another, generation, of, public, administration, theorists, began, to, displace, the, last, the, new, theory, which, came, to, be, called, new, public, management, was, proposed, by, david, osborne, and, ted, gaebler, in, their, book, reinventing, government, the, new, model, advocated, the, use, of, private, sector, style, models, organizational, ideas, and, values, to, improve, the, efficiency, and, service, orientation, of, the, public, sector, during, the, clinton, administration, 1993, 2001, vice, president, al, gore, adopted, and, reformed, federal, agencies, using, npm, approaches, in, the, 1990, s, new, public, management, became, prevalent, throughout, the, bureaucracies, of, the, us, the, uk, and, to, a, lesser, extent, in, canada, the, original, public, management, theories, have, roots, attributed, to, policy, analysis, according, to, richard, elmore, in, his, 1986, article, published, in, the, journal, of, policy, analysis, and, management, some, modern, authors, define, npm, as, a, combination, of, splitting, large, bureaucracies, into, smaller, more, fragmented, agencies, encouraging, competition, between, different, public, agencies, and, encouraging, competition, between, public, agencies, and, private, firms, and, using, economic, incentives, lines, e, g, performance, pay, for, senior, executives, or, user, pay, models, npm, treats, individuals, as, customers, or, clients, in, the, private, sector, sense, rather, than, as, citizens, some, critics, argue, that, the, new, public, management, concept, of, treating, people, as, customers, rather, than, citizens, is, an, inappropriate, borrowing, from, the, private, sector, model, because, businesses, see, customers, as, a, means, to, an, end, profit, rather, than, as, the, proprietors, of, government, the, owners, opposed, to, merely, the, customers, of, a, business, the, patrons, in, new, public, management, people, are, viewed, as, economic, units, not, as, democratic, participants, which, is, the, hazard, of, linking, an, mba, business, administration, economic, and, employer, based, model, too, closely, with, the, public, administration, governmental, public, good, sector, nevertheless, the, npm, model, one, of, four, described, by, elmore, in, 1986, including, the, generic, model, is, still, widely, accepted, at, multiple, levels, of, government, e, g, municipal, state, province, and, federal, and, in, many, oecd, nations, in, the, late, 1990s, janet, and, robert, denhardt, proposed, a, new, public, services, model, in, response, to, the, dominance, of, npm, a, successor, to, npm, is, digital, era, governance, focusing, on, themes, of, reintegrating, government, responsibilities, needs, based, holism, executing, duties, in, cursive, ways, and, digitalization, exploiting, the, transformational, capabilities, of, modern, it, and, digital, storage, one, example, of, the, deployment, of, deg, is, openforum, com, au, an, australian, not, for, profit, e, democracy, project, that, invites, politicians, senior, public, servants, academics, business, people, and, other, key, stakeholders, to, engage, in, high, level, policy, debate, another, example, is, brunei, s, information, department, in, deploying, social, media, technology, to, improve, its, digital, governance, process, the, book, chapter, work, concludes, that, digital, dividends, can, be, secured, through, the, effective, application, of, social, media, within, the, framework, of, digital, era, governance, another, new, public, service, model, is, what, has, been, called, new, public, governance, an, approach, that, includes, a, centralization, of, power, an, increased, number, role, and, influence, of, partisan, political, staff, personal, politicization, of, appointments, to, the, senior, public, service, and, the, assumption, that, the, public, service, is, promiscuously, partisan, for, the, government, of, the, day, in, the, mid, 1980s, the, goal, of, community, programs, in, the, united, states, was, often, represented, by, terms, such, as, independent, living, community, integration, inclusion, community, participation, deinstitutionalization, and, civil, rights, thus, the, same, public, policy, and, public, administration, was, to, apply, to, all, citizens, inclusive, of, disability, however, by, the, 1990s, categorical, state, systems, were, strengthened, in, the, united, states, racino, in, press, 2014, and, efforts, were, made, to, introduce, more, disability, content, into, the, public, policy, curricula, with, disability, public, policy, and, administration, distinct, fields, in, their, own, right, behaviorists, have, also, dominated, intervention, practice, generally, not, the, province, of, public, administration, in, recent, years, believing, that, they, are, in, opposition, to, generic, public, policy, termed, ecological, systems, theory, of, the, late, urie, bronfenbrenner, increasingly, public, policy, academics, and, practitioners, have, utilized, the, theoretical, concepts, of, political, economy, to, explain, policy, outcomes, such, as, the, success, or, failure, of, reform, efforts, or, the, persistence, of, suboptimal, outcomes, contemporary, scholars, are, reclaiming, a, companion, public, administration, origin, story, that, includes, the, contributions, of, women, this, has, become, known, as, the, alternative, or, settlement, model, of, public, administration, during, the, 19th, century, upper, class, women, in, the, united, states, and, europe, organized, voluntary, associations, that, worked, to, mitigate, the, excesses, of, urbanization, and, industrialization, in, their, towns, eventually, these, voluntary, associations, became, networks, that, were, able, to, spearhead, changes, to, policy, and, administration, these, women, s, civic, clubs, worked, to, make, cities, and, workplaces, safer, cleaner, streets, water, sewage, and, workplace, as, well, as, workplace, regulation, and, more, suited, to, the, needs, of, their, children, playgrounds, libraries, juvenile, courts, child, labor, laws, these, were, administrative, and, policy, spaces, ignored, by, their, fathers, and, husbands, the, work, of, these, clubs, was, amplified, by, newly, organized, non, profit, organizations, settlement, houses, usually, situated, in, industrialized, city, slums, filled, with, immigrants, reforms, that, emerged, from, the, new, deal, e, g, income, for, the, old, unemployment, insurance, aid, for, dependent, children, and, the, disabled, child, labor, prohibitions, and, limits, on, hours, worked, etc, were, supported, by, leaders, of, the, settlement, movement, richard, stillman, credits, jane, addams, a, key, leader, of, the, settlement, movement, and, a, pioneer, of, public, administration, with, conceiving, and, spawning, the, modern, welfare, state, the, accomplishments, of, the, settlement, movement, and, their, conception, of, public, administration, were, ignored, in, the, early, literature, of, public, administration, the, alternative, model, of, public, administration, was, invisible, or, buried, for, about, 100, years, until, camilla, stivers, published, bureau, men, and, settlement, women, in, 2000, settlement, workers, explicitly, fought, for, social, justice, as, they, campaigned, for, reform, they, sought, policy, changes, that, would, improve, the, lives, of, immigrants, women, children, sick, old, and, impoverished, people, both, municipal, housekeeping, and, industrial, citizenship, applied, an, ethic, of, care, informed, by, the, feminine, experience, of, policy, and, administration, while, they, saw, the, relevance, of, the, traditional, public, administration, values, efficiency, effectiveness, etc, and, practices, of, their, male, reformist, counterparts, they, also, emphasized, social, justice, and, social, equity, jane, addams, for, example, was, a, founder, of, the, national, association, for, the, advancement, of, colored, people, naacp, the, settlement, movement, and, its, leaders, such, as, jane, addams, julia, lathrop, and, florence, kelley, were, instrumental, in, crafting, the, alternative, feminine, inspired, model, of, public, administration, this, settlement, model, of, public, administration, had, two, interrelated, components, municipal, housekeeping, and, industrial, citizenship, municipal, housekeeping, called, for, cities, to, be, run, like, a, caring, home, the, city, should, be, conceived, as, an, extension, of, the, home, where, families, could, be, safe, and, children, cared, for, clean, streets, clean, water, playgrounds, educational, curricular, reform, and, juvenile, courts, are, examples, of, reforms, associated, with, this, movement, industrial, citizenship, focused, on, the, problems, and, risks, of, labor, force, participation, in, a, laissez, faire, newly, industrialized,

several, sub, fields, scholars, have, proposed, several, different, sets, of, sub, fields, one, of, the, proposed, models, uses, five, pillars, universities, can, offer, undergraduate, and, graduate, degrees, in, public, administration, or, government, political, science, and, international, affairs, with, a, concentration, or, specialization, in, public, policy, and, administration, graduate, degrees, include, the, master, of, public, administration, mpa, degree, a, master, of, arts, ma, or, master, of, science, ms, in, public, administration, for, the, management, tract, and, the, master, of, public, policy, mpp, a, master, of, arts, ma, or, a, master, of, science, ms, in, public, policy, for, the, research, tract, in, the, united, states, the, academic, field, of, public, administration, draws, heavily, on, political, science, and, administrative, law, some, mpa, programs, include, economics, courses, to, give, students, a, background, in, micro, economic, issues, markets, rationing, mechanisms, etc, and, macroeconomic, issues, e, g, national, debt, scholars, such, as, john, a, rohr, write, of, a, long, history, behind, the, constitutional, legitimacy, of, government, bureaucracy, one, public, administration, scholar, donald, kettl, argues, that, public, administration, sits, in, a, disciplinary, backwater, because, for, the, last, generation, scholars, have, sought, to, save, or, replace, it, with, fields, of, study, like, implementation, public, management, and, formal, bureaucratic, theory, kettl, states, that, public, administration, as, a, subfield, within, political, science, is, struggling, to, define, its, role, within, the, discipline, he, notes, two, problems, with, public, administration, it, has, seemed, methodologically, to, lag, behind, and, the, field, s, theoretical, work, too, often, seems, not, to, define, it, indeed, some, of, the, most, interesting, recent, ideas, in, public, administration, have, come, from, outside, the, field, public, administration, theory, is, the, domain, in, which, discussions, of, the, meaning, and, purpose, of, government, the, role, of, bureaucracy, in, supporting, democratic, governments, budgets, governance, and, public, affairs, take, place, comparative, public, administration, or, cpa, is, defined, as, the, study, of, administrative, systems, in, a, comparative, fashion, or, the, study, of, public, administration, in, other, countries, today, there, is, a, section, of, the, american, society, for, public, administration, that, specializes, in, comparative, administration, it, is, responsible, for, the, annual, riggs, award, for, lifetime, achievement, in, international, and, comparative, public, administration, there, have, been, several, issues, that, have, hampered, the, development, of, comparative, public, administration, including, the, major, differences, between, western, countries, and, developing, countries, the, lack, of, curriculum, on, this, sub, field, in, public, administration, programs, and, the, lack, of, success, in, developing, theoretical, models, that, can, be, scientifically, tested, even, though, cpa, is, a, weakly, formed, field, as, a, whole, this, sub, field, of, public, administration, is, an, attempt, at, cross, cultural, analysis, a, quest, for, patterns, and, regularities, of, administrative, action, and, behavior, cpa, is, an, integral, part, to, the, analysis, of, public, administration, techniques, the, process, of, comparison, allows, for, more, widely, applicable, policies, to, be, tested, in, a, variety, of, situations, comparative, public, administration, lacks, a, curriculum, which, has, prevented, it, from, becoming, a, major, field, of, study, this, lack, of, understanding, of, the, basic, concepts, that, build, this, field, s, foundation, has, ultimately, led, to, its, lack, of, use, for, example, william, waugh, a, professor, at, georgia, state, university, has, stated, comparative, studies, are, difficult, because, of, the, necessity, to, provide, enough, information, on, the, socio, political, context, of, national, administrative, structures, and, processes, for, readers, to, understand, why, there, are, differences, and, similarities, he, also, asserts, although, there, is, sizable, literature, on, comparative, public, administration, it, is, scattered, and, dated, universities, offer, undergraduate, level, bachelor, s, degrees, in, public, administration, or, government, political, science, and, international, affairs, with, an, academic, concentration, or, specialization, in, public, policy, and, administration, at, several, universities, undergraduate, level, public, administration, and, non, profit, management, education, is, packaged, together, along, with, international, relations, and, security, studies, in, a, degree, in, political, science, some, public, administration, programs, have, similarities, to, business, administration, programs, in, cases, where, the, students, from, both, the, master, s, in, public, administration, mpa, and, master, s, in, business, administration, mba, programs, take, many, of, the, same, courses, in, some, programs, the, mpa, or, mapa, is, more, clearly, distinct, from, the, mba, in, that, the, mpa, often, emphasizes, substantially, different, ethical, and, sociological, criteria, that, pertain, to, administering, government, programs, for, the, public, good, that, have, not, been, key, criteria, for, business, managers, who, typically, aim, to, maximize, profit, or, share, price, there, are, two, types, of, doctoral, degrees, in, public, administration, the, doctor, of, public, administration, dpa, and, the, ph, d, in, public, administration, the, dpa, is, an, applied, research, doctoral, degree, in, the, field, of, public, administration, focusing, on, the, practice, of, public, administration, more, than, on, its, theoretical, aspects, the, ph, d, is, typically, sought, by, individuals, aiming, to, become, professors, of, public, administration, or, researchers, individuals, pursuing, a, ph, d, in, public, administration, often, pursue, more, theoretical, dissertation, topics, than, their, dpa, counterparts, notable, scholars, of, public, administration, have, come, from, a, wide, range, of, fields, in, the, period, before, public, administration, existed, as, its, own, independent, sub, discipline, of, political, science, scholars, contributing, to, the, field, came, from, economics, sociology, management, political, science, legal, specifically, administrative, law, and, other, related, fields, more, recently, scholars, from, public, administration, and, public, policy, have, contributed, important, studies, and, theories, for, notable, institutions, see, the, wikipedia, article, on, public, policy, schools, there, are, a, number, of, international, public, administration, organizations, the, commonwealth, association, of,

government, administration, and, nonprofit, administration, that, resembles, or, draws, on, private, sector, management, and, business, techniques, and, approaches, these, business, approaches, often, aim, to, maximize, efficiency, and, effectiveness, and, provide, improved, customer, service, a, contrast, is, drawn, with, the, study, of, public, administration, which, emphasizes, the, social, and, cultural, drivers, of, government, that, many, contend, e, g, graham, t, allison, and, charles, goodsell, makes, it, different, from, the, private, sector, a, positive, and, negative, definition, of, public, management, have, been, proposed, the, positive, approach, as, praxeological, and, rightful, process, of, public, service, for, citizens, for, the, sake, of, their, and, following,
