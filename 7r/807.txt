corruption, is, a, form, of, dishonesty, or, a, criminal, offense, which, is, undertaken, by, a, person, or, an, organization, which, is, entrusted, in, a, position, of, authority, in, order, to, acquire, illicit, benefits, or, abuse, power, for, one, s, personal, gain, corruption, may, involve, many, activities, which, include, bribery, influence, peddling, and, embezzlement, and, it, may, also, involve, practices, which, are, legal, in, many, countries, political, corruption, occurs, when, an, office, holder, or, other, governmental, employee, acts, with, an, official, capacity, for, personal, gain, corruption, is, perceived, as, most, common, in, kleptocracies, oligarchies, narco, states, and, mafia, states, however, more, recent, research, and, policy, statements, acknowledge, that, it, also, exists, in, wealthy, capitalist, economies, in, how, corrupt, is, britain, david, whyte, reveals, that, corruption, exists, across, a, wide, range, of, venerated, institutions, in, the, uk, which, is, ranked, one, of, the, least, corrupt, countries, by, the, corruption, perceptions, index, cpi, in, a, 2022, speech, on, modern, corruption, usaid, administrator, samantha, power, stated, corruption, is, no, longer, just, about, individual, autocrats, pilfering, their, nation, s, wealth, to, live, large, but, also, involves, sophisticated, transnational, networks, including, financial, institutions, hidden, in, secrecy, responding, to, whyte, s, book, george, monbiot, criticized, the, cpi, for, its, narrow, definition, of, corruption, that, surveys, mostly, only, western, executives, about, bribery, similarly, others, point, out, that, global, metrics, systematically, under, measure, corruption, of, the, rich, which, tends, to, be, legalized, institutionalized, and, ambiguously, unethical, as, opposed, to, corruption, of, the, poor, corruption, and, crime, are, endemic, sociological, occurrences, which, appear, with, regular, frequency, in, virtually, all, countries, on, a, global, scale, in, varying, degrees, and, proportions, recent, data, suggests, corruption, is, on, the, rise, each, individual, nation, allocates, domestic, resources, for, the, control, and, regulation, of, corruption, and, the, deterrence, of, crime, strategies, which, are, undertaken, in, order, to, counter, corruption, are, often, summarized, under, the, umbrella, term, anti, corruption, additionally, global, initiatives, like, the, united, nations, sustainable, development, goal, 16, also, have, a, targeted, goal, which, is, supposed, to, substantially, reduce, corruption, in, all, of, its, forms, recent, initiatives, like, the, tax, justice, network, goes, beyond, bribery, and, theft, and, brings, attention, to, tax, abuses, stephen, d, morris, a, professor, of, politics, wrote, that, political, corruption, is, the, illegitimate, use, of, public, power, to, benefit, a, private, interest, economist, ian, senior, defined, corruption, as, an, action, to, secretly, provide, a, good, or, a, service, to, a, third, party, to, influence, certain, actions, which, benefit, the, corrupt, a, third, party, or, both, in, which, the, corrupt, agent, has, authority, world, bank, economist, daniel, kaufmann, extended, the, concept, to, include, legal, corruption, in, which, power, is, abused, within, the, confines, of, the, law, as, those, with, power, often, have, the, ability, to, make, laws, for, their, protection, the, effect, of, corruption, in, infrastructure, is, to, increase, costs, and, construction, time, lower, the, quality, and, decrease, the, benefit, corruption, is, a, complex, phenomenon, and, can, occur, on, different, scales, corruption, ranges, from, small, favors, between, a, small, number, of, people, petty, corruption, to, corruption, that, affects, the, government, on, a, large, scale, grand, corruption, and, corruption, that, is, so, prevalent, that, it, is, part, of, the, everyday, structure, of, society, including, corruption, as, one, of, the, symptoms, of, organized, crime, systemic, corruption, corruption, of, the, rich, is, particularly, hard, to, measure, and, largely, excluded, from, conventional, metrics, like, the, cpi, a, number, of, indicators, and, tools, have, been, developed, which, can, measure, different, forms, of, corruption, with, increasing, accuracy, but, when, those, are, impractical, one, study, suggests, looking, at, bodyfat, as, a, rough, guide, after, finding, that, obesity, of, cabinet, ministers, in, post, soviet, states, was, highly, correlated, with, more, accurate, measures, of, corruption, political, economist, yuen, yuen, ang, unbundles, corruption, into, four, types, encompassing, both, petty, and, grand, corruption, as, well, as, legal, and, illegal, versions, petty, theft, grand, theft, speed, money, access, money, according, to, her, definition, speed, money, means, petty, bribes, that, businesses, or, citizens, pay, to, bureaucrats, to, get, around, hurdles, or, speed, things, up, this, is, the, kind, of, corruption, associated, with, the, efficient, grease, hypothesis, which, economists, found, burdensome, to, businesses, in, practice, ang, defines, access, money, as, high, stakes, rewards, extended, by, business, actors, to, powerful, officials, not, just, for, speed, but, to, access, exclusive, valuable, privileges, most, theories, about, bribery, focus, on, speed, money, but, neglects, access, money, from, a, businessperson, s, point, of, view, access, money, is, less, a, tax, than, an, investment, making, it, more, sludge, than, grease, the, unbundled, corruption, index, measures, the, prevalence, of, these, four, types, of, corruption, whereas, corruption, with, theft, and, speed, money, is, endemic, in, poor, countries, access, money, can, be, found, in, both, poor, and, rich, countries, petty, corruption, occurs, at, a, smaller, scale, and, takes, place, at, the, implementation, end, of, public, services, when, public, officials, meet, the, public, for, example, in, many, small, places, such, as, registration, offices, police, stations, state, licensing, boards, and, many, other, private, and, government, sectors, grand, corruption, is, defined, as, corruption, occurring, at, the, highest, levels, of, government, in, a, way, that, requires, significant, subversion, of, the, political, legal, and, economic, systems, such, corruption, is, commonly, found, in, countries, with, authoritarian, or, dictatorial, governments, but, also, in, those, without, adequate, policing, of, corruption, the, government, system, in, many, countries, is, divided, into, the, legislative, executive, and, judicial, branches, in, an, attempt, to, provide, independent, services, that, are, less, subject, to, grand, corruption, due, to, their, independence, from, one, another, systemic, corruption, or, endemic, corruption, is, corruption, which, is, primarily, due, to, the, weaknesses, of, an, organization, or, process, it, can, be, contrasted, with, individual, officials, or, agents, who, act, corruptly, within, the, system, factors, which, encourage, systemic, corruption, include, conflicting, incentives, discretionary, powers, monopolistic, powers, lack, of, transparency, low, pay, and, a, culture, of, impunity, specific, acts, of, corruption, include, bribery, extortion, and, embezzlement, in, a, system, where, corruption, becomes, the, rule, rather, than, the, exception, scholars, distinguish, between, centralized, and, decentralized, systemic, corruption, depending, on, which, level, of, state, or, government, corruption, takes, place, in, countries, such, as, the, post, soviet, states, both, types, occur, some, scholars, argue, that, there, is, a, negative, duty, of, western, governments, to, protect, against, systematic, corruption, of, underdeveloped, governments, corruption, has, been, a, major, issue, in, china, where, society, depends, heavily, on, personal, relationships, by, the, late, 20th, century, that, combined, with, the, new, lust, for, wealth, produced, escalating, corruption, historian, keith, schoppa, says, that, bribery, was, only, one, of, the, tools, of, chinese, corruption, which, also, included, embezzlement, nepotism, smuggling, extortion, cronyism, kickbacks, deception, fraud, squandering, of, public, money, illegal, business, transactions, stock, manipulation, and, real, estate, fraud, given, the, repeated, anti, corruption, campaigns, it, was, a, prudent, precaution, to, move, as, much, of, the, fraudulent, money, as, possible, overseas, in, latin, american, countries, corruption, is, permitted, as, a, result, of, the, cultural, norms, of, the, institution, in, countries, like, the, united, states, there, is, a, relatively, strong, sense, of, trust, among, strangers, one, that, is, not, found, in, latin, american, countries, in, latin, american, countries, this, trust, does, not, exist, whereas, the, social, norms, imply, that, no, stranger, is, responsible, for, the, wellbeing, or, happiness, of, another, stranger, instead, the, trust, is, found, in, acquaintances, acquaintances, are, treated, with, trust, and, respect, a, level, of, trust, that, is, not, found, among, acquaintances, in, countries, like, the, united, states, this, is, what, permits, for, corruption, in, latin, american, countries, if, there, is, a, strong, enough, trust, within, an, administration, that, no, one, will, betray, the, rest, corruptive, policies, will, take, place, with, ease, while, petty, grand, and, systemic, corruption, described, above, are, largely, found, in, poor, countries, with, weak, institutions, a, newer, literature, has, turned, to, money, politics, in, wealthy, democracies, and, extreme, global, inequalities, simon, weschle, at, syracuse, university, examines, the, prevalence, of, campaign, finance, and, its, consequences, for, democracy, kristin, surak, at, the, london, school, of, economics, explores, the, controversial, practice, of, millionaires, buying, golden, passports, with, no, intention, of, actually, migrating, in, her, words, a, full, blown, citizenship, industry, that, thrives, on, global, inequalities, has, arisen, while, not, necessarily, involving, bribery, recent, research, documents, the, emergence, of, a, particular, kind, of, large, non, state, business, group, that, is, akin, to, a, mafia, system, in, china, in, this, situation, the, boundary, between, public, and, private, actors, blurs, much, of, existing, literature, focuses, on, explicit, corrupt, actions, like, bribery, and, embezzlement, endemic, in, poor, countries, see, below, for, money, in, politics, the, causes, are, very, different, and, largely, ignored, in, conventional, literature, for, example, the, uk, is, a, developed, economy, with, a, robust, democracy, and, yet, london, is, a, hub, for, money, laundering, in, a, critique, of, the, failures, and, politics, leading, up, to, the, us, financial, crisis, a, stanford, financial, economist, noted, in, the, real, world, it, turned, out, important, economic, outcomes, are, often, the, consequences, of, political, forces, during, 2010, people, within, regulatory, bodies, told, me, privately, that, false, and, misleading, claims, were, affecting, key, policy, decisions, i, saw, confusion, willful, blindness, political, forces, various, and, sometimes, subtle, forms, of, corruption, and, moral, disengagement, first, hand, per, r, klitgaard, corruption, will, occur, if, the, corrupt, gain, is, greater, than, the, penalty, multiplied, by, the, likelihood, of, being, caught, and, prosecuted, since, a, high, degree, of, monopoly, and, discretion, accompanied, by, a, low, degree, of, transparency, does, not, automatically, lead, to, corruption, a, fourth, variable, of, morality, or, integrity, has, been, introduced, by, others, the, moral, dimension, has, an, intrinsic, component, and, refers, to, a, mentality, problem, and, an, extrinsic, component, referring, to, circumstances, like, poverty, inadequate, remuneration, inappropriate, work, conditions, and, inoperable, or, over, complicated, procedures, which, demoralize, people, and, let, them, search, for, alternative, solutions, according, to, a, 2017, survey, study, the, following, factors, have, been, attributed, as, causes, of, corruption, it, has, been, noted, that, in, a, comparison, of, the, most, corrupt, with, the, least, corrupt, countries, the, former, group, contains, nations, with, huge, socio, economic, inequalities, and, the, latter, contains, nations, with, a, high, degree, of, social, and, economic, justice, social, norms, have, been, posited, as, an, explanation, for, why, some, environments, are, corrupt, and, others, are, not, corruption, can, occur, in, many, sectors, whether, they, be, public, or, private, industry, or, even, ngos, especially, in, public, sector, however, only, in, democratically, controlled, institutions, is, there, an, interest, of, the, public, owner, to, develop, internal, mechanisms, to, fight, active, or, passive, corruption, whereas, in, private, industry, as, well, as, in, ngos, there, is, no, public, control, therefore, the, owners, investors, or, sponsors, profits, are, largely, decisive, public, corruption, includes, corruption, of, the, political, process, and, of, government, agencies, such, as, tax, collectors, and, the, police, as, well, as, corruption, in, processes, of, allocating, public, funds, for, contracts, grants, and, hiring, recent, research, by, the, world, bank, suggests, that, who, makes, policy, decisions, elected, officials, or, bureaucrats, can, be, critical, in, determining, the, level, of, corruption, because, of, the, incentives, different, policy, makers, face, judicial, corruption, refers, to, the, corruption, related, misconduct, of, judges, through, the, receiving, or, giving, of, bribes, the, improper, sentencing, of, convicted, criminals, bias, in, the, hearing, and, judgement, of, arguments, and, other, forms, of, misconduct, judicial, corruption, can, also, be, conducted, by, prosecutors, and, defense, attorneys, an, example, of, prosecutorial, misconduct, occurs, when, a, politician, or, a, crime, boss, bribes, a, prosecutor, to, open, investigations, and, file, charges, against, an, opposing, politician, or, a, rival, crime, boss, in, order, to, hurt, the, competition, governmental, corruption, of, the, judiciary, is, broadly, known, in, many, transitional, and, developing, countries, because, the, budget, is, almost, completely, controlled, by, the, executive, the, latter, critically, undermines, the, separation, of, powers, because, it, fosters, financial, dependence, on, the, judiciary, the, proper, distribution, of, a, nation, s, wealth, including, its, government, s, spending, on, the, judiciary, is, subject, to, constitutional, economics, the, judiciary, may, be, corrupted, by, acts, of, the, government, such, as, through, budget, planning, and, various, privileges, and, by, private, acts, corruption, in, judiciary, may, also, involve, the, government, using, its, judicial, arm, to, oppress, opposition, parties, judicial, corruption, is, difficult, to, completely, eradicate, even, in, developed, countries, military, corruption, refers, to, the, abuse, of, power, by, members, in, the, armed, forces, in, order, for, career, advancement, or, for, personal, gain, by, a, soldier, or, soldiers, one, form, of, military, corruption, in, the, united, states, armed, forces, is, a, military, soldier, being, promoted, in, rank, or, being, given, better, treatment, than, their, colleagues, by, their, officers, due, to, their, race, sexual, orientation, ethnicity, gender, religious, beliefs, social, class, or, personal, relationships, with, higher, ranking, officers, in, spite, of, their, merit, in, addition, to, that, the, us, military, has, also, had, many, instances, of, officers, sexually, assaulting, fellow, officers, and, in, many, cases, there, were, allegations, that, many, of, the, attacks, were, covered, up, and, victims, were, coerced, to, remain, silent, by, officers, of, the, same, rank, or, of, higher, rank, another, example, of, military, corruption, is, a, military, officer, or, officers, using, the, power, of, their, positions, to, commit, activities, that, are, illegal, such, as, skimming, logistical, supplies, such, as, food, medicine, fuel, body, armor, or, weapons, to, sell, on, the, local, black, market, there, have, also, been, instances, of, military, officials, providing, equipment, and, combat, support, to, criminal, syndicates, private, military, companies, and, terrorist, groups, without, approval, from, their, superiors, as, a, result, many, countries, have, a, military, police, force, to, ensure, that, the, military, officers, follow, the, laws, and, conduct, of, their, respective, countries, but, sometimes, the, military, police, have, levels, of, corruption, themselves, within, less, democratic, countries, the, presence, of, resources, such, as, diamonds, gold, oil, and, forestry, increases, the, prevalence, of, corruption, corruption, includes, industrial, corruption, consisting, of, large, bribes, as, well, as, petty, corruption, such, as, a, poacher, paying, off, a, park, ranger, to, ignore, poaching, the, presence, of, fuel, extraction, and, export, is, unambiguously, associated, with, corruption, whereas, mineral, exports, only, increased, corruption, in, poorer, countries, in, wealthier, countries, mineral, exports, such, as, gold, and, diamonds, are, actually, associated, with, reduced, corruption, the, international, extractive, industries, transparency, initiative, seeks, to, create, best, practices, for, good, governance, of, gas, oil, and, minerals, particularly, focusing, on, the, state, management, of, revenue, from, these, resources, any, valued, natural, resource, can, be, affected, by, corruption, including, water, for, irrigation, land, for, livestock, grazing, forests, for, hunting, and, logging, and, fisheries, the, presence, or, perception, of, corruption, also, undermines, environmental, initiatives, in, kenya, farmers, blame, poor, agricultural, productivity, on, corruption, and, thus, are, less, likely, to, undertake, soil, conservation, measures, to, prevent, soil, erosion, and, loss, of, nutrients, in, benin, mistrust, of, government, due, to, perceived, corruption, led,

with, their, country, or, region, the, political, act, of, graft, american, english, is, a, well, known, and, now, global, form, of, political, corruption, being, the, unscrupulous, and, illegal, use, of, a, politician, s, authority, for, personal, gain, when, funds, intended, for, public, projects, are, intentionally, misdirected, in, order, to, maximize, the, benefits, to, illegally, private, interests, of, the, corrupted, individual, s, and, their, cronies, in, some, cases, government, institutions, are, repurposed, or, shifted, away, from, their, official, mandate, to, serve, other, often, corrupt, purposes, the, kaunas, golden, toilet, case, was, a, major, lithuanian, scandal, in, 2009, the, municipality, of, kaunas, led, by, mayor, andrius, kup, inskas, ordered, that, a,

because, of, the, inflated, cost, of, the, outdoor, toilet, it, was, nicknamed, the, golden, toilet, despite, the, investment, the, golden, toilet, remained, closed, for, years, due, to, the,

tests, have, met, backlash, from, part, of, society, while, others, appreciate, the, changes, vouchers, for, university, entrants, have, never, materialized, the, cost, of, corruption, is, that, it, impedes, sustainable, economic, growth, endemic, corruption, in, educational, institutions, leads, to, the, formation, of, sustainable, corrupt, hierarchies, while, higher, education, in, russia, is, distinct, with, widespread, bribery, corruption, in, the, us, and, the, uk, features, a, significant, amount, of, fraud, the, us, is, distinct, with, grey, areas, and, institutional, corruption, in,

corruption, actually, stimulated, economic, growth, in, east, and, southeast, asian, countries, an, often, cited, example, is, south, korea, where, president, park, chung, hee, favoured, a, small,

incentivizes, government, officials, to, support, economic, development, as, they, would, personally, benefit, financially, from, it, one, neglected, example, of, high, growth, with, corruption, is, america, during, the, gilded, age, which, yuen, yuen, ang, has, compared, to, china, s, gilded, age, in, both, she, noted, corruption, evolved, over, time, from, thuggery, and, theft, to, more, sophisticated, exchanges, of, power, and, profit, and, resultingly, both, saw, unequal, and, risky, growth, biased, narratives, about, western, development, and, global, metrics, of, corruption, have, obscured, this, historical, pattern, according, to, the, amended, klitgaard, equation, limitation, of, monopoly, and, regulator, discretion, of, individuals, and, a, high, degree, of, transparency, through, independent, oversight, by, non, governmental, organisations, ngos, and, the, media, plus, public, access, to, reliable, information, could, reduce, the, problem, djankov, and, other, researchers, have, independently, addressed, the, role, information, plays, in, fighting, corruption, with, evidence, from, both, developing, and, developed, countries, disclosing, financial, information, of, government, officials, to, the, public, is, associated, with, improving, institutional, accountability, and, eliminating, misbehavior, such, as, vote, buying, the, effect, is, specifically, remarkable, when, the, disclosures, concern, politicians, income, sources, liabilities, and, asset, level, instead, of, just, income, level, any, extrinsic, aspects, that, might, reduce, morality, should, be, eliminated, additionally, a, country, should, establish, a, culture, of, ethical, conduct, in, society, with, the, government, setting, the, good, example, in, order, to, enhance, the, intrinsic, morality, creating, bottom, up, mechanisms, promoting, citizens, participation, and, encouraging, the, values, of, integrity, accountability, and, transparency, are, crucial, components, of, fighting, corruption, as, of, 2012, the, implementation, of, the, advocacy, and, legal, advice, centres, alacs, in, europe, had, led, to, a, significant, increase, in, the, number, of, citizen, complaints, against, acts, of, corruption, received, and, documented, and, also, to, the, development, of, strategies, for, good, governance, by, involving, citizens, willing, to, fight, against, corruption, the, foreign, corrupt, practices, act, fcpa, usa, 1977, was, an, early, paradigmatic, law, for, many, western, countries, i, e, industrial, countries, of, the, oecd, there, for, the, first, time, the, old, principal, agent, approach, was, moved, back, where, mainly, the, victim, a, society, private, or, public, and, a, passive, corrupt, member, an, individual, were, considered, whereas, the, active, corrupt, part, was, not, in, the, focus, of, legal, prosecution, unprecedented, the, law, of, an, industrial, country, directly, condemned, active, corruption, particularly, in, international, business, transactions, which, was, at, that, time, in, contradiction, to, anti, bribery, activities, of, the, world, bank, and, its, spin, off, organization, transparency, international, as, early, as, 1989, the, oecd, had, established, an, ad, hoc, working, group, in, order, to, explore, the, concepts, fundamental, to, the, offense, of, corruption, and, the, exercise, of, national, jurisdiction, over, offenses, committed, wholly, or, partially, abroad, based, on, the, fcpa, concept, the, working, group, presented, in, 1994, the, then, oecd, anti, bribery, recommendation, as, precursor, for, the, oecd, convention, on, combating, bribery, of, foreign, public, officials, in, international, business, transactions, which, was, signed, in, 1997, by, all, member, countries, and, came, finally, into, force, in, 1999, however, because, of, ongoing, concealed, corruption, in, international, transactions, several, instruments, of, country, monitoring, have, been, developed, since, then, by, the, oecd, in, order, to, foster, and, evaluate, related, national, activities, in, combating, foreign, corrupt, practices, one, survey, shows, that, after, the, implementation, of, heightened, review, of, multinational, firms, under, the, convention, in, 2010, firms, from, countries, that, had, signed, the, convention, were, less, likely, to, use, bribery, in, 2013, a, document, produced, by, the, economic, and, private, sector, professional, evidence, and, applied, knowledge, services, help, desk, discusses, some, of, the, existing, practices, on, anti, corruption, they, found, in, recent, years, anti, corruption, efforts, have, also, been, criticised, for, overemphasising, the, benefits, of, the, eradication, of, corruption, for, economic, growth, and, development, following, a, diversity, of, literature, which, has, suggested, that, anti, corruption, efforts, the, right, kind, of, institutions, and, good, governance, are, key, to, economic, development, this, criticism, is, based, on, the, observed, fact, that, a, variety, of, countries, such, as, korea, and, china, but, also, the, us, in, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, century, saw, high, economic, growth, and, broader, socio, economic, development, coinciding, with, significant, corruption, in, some, countries, people, travel, to, corruption, hot, spots, or, a, specialist,

runaway, jury, the, firm, syriana, the, constant, gardener, and, all, the, president, s, men, though, corruption, is, often, viewed, as, illegal, a, concept, of, legal, corruption, has, been, described, by, daniel, kaufmann, and, pedro, vicente, it, might, be, termed, as, processes, which, are, corrupt, but, are, protected, by, a, legal, that, is, specifically, permitted, or, at, least, not, proscribed, by, law, framework, in, 1994, the, german, parliamentary, financial, commission, in, bonn, presented, a, comparative, study, on, legal, corruption, in, industrialized, oecd, countries, they, reported, that, in, most, industrial, countries, foreign, corruption, was, legal, and, that, their, foreign, corrupt, practices, ranged, from, simple, through, governmental, subsidization, tax, deduction, up, to, extreme, cases, as, in, germany, where, foreign, corruption, was, fostered, whereas, domestic, was, legally, prosecuted, the, german, parliamentary, financial, commission, rejected, a, parliamentary, proposal, by, the, opposition, which, had, been, aiming, to, limit, german, foreign, corruption, on, the, basis, of, the, us, foreign, corrupt, practices, act, fcpa, from, 1977, thus, fostering, national, export, corporations, in, 1997, a, corresponding, oecd, anti, bribery, convention, was, signed, by, its, members, it, took, until, 1999, after, the, oecd, anti, bribery, convention, came, into, force, that, germany, withdrew, the, legalization, of, foreign, corruption, a, study, on, foreign, corrupt, practices, of, industrialized, oecd, countries, 1994,
