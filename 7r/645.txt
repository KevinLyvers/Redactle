list, of, forms, of, government, democracy, from, ancient, greek, romanized, d, mokrat, a, d, mos, people, and, kratos, rule, is, a, system, of, government, in, which, state, power, is, vested, in, the, people, or, the, general, population, of, a, state, under, a, minimalist, definition, of, democracy, rulers, are, elected, through, competitive, elections, while, more, expansive, definitions, link, democracy, to, guarantees, of, civil, liberties, and, human, rights, in, addition, to, competitive, elections, in, a, direct, democracy, the, people, have, the, direct, authority, to, deliberate, and, decide, legislation, in, a, representative, democracy, the, people, choose, governing, officials, through, elections, to, do, so, who, is, considered, part, of, the, people, and, how, authority, is, shared, among, or, delegated, by, the, people, has, changed, over, time, and, at, different, rates, in, different, countries, features, of, democracy, oftentimes, include, freedom, of, assembly, association, personal, property, freedom, of, religion, and, speech, citizenship, consent, of, the, governed, voting, rights, freedom, from, unwarranted, governmental, deprivation, of, the, right, to, life, and, liberty, and, minority, rights, the, notion, of, democracy, has, evolved, considerably, over, time, throughout, history, one, can, find, evidence, of, direct, democracy, in, which, communities, make, decisions, through, popular, assembly, today, the, dominant, form, of, democracy, is, representative, democracy, where, citizens, elect, government, officials, to, govern, on, their, behalf, such, as, in, a, parliamentary, or, presidential, democracy, most, democracies, apply, in, most, cases, majority, rule, but, in, some, cases, plurality, rule, supermajority, rule, e, g, constitution, or, consensus, rule, e, g, switzerland, are, applied, they, serve, the, crucial, purpose, of, inclusiveness, and, broader, legitimacy, on, sensitive, issues, counterbalancing, majoritarianism, and, therefore, mostly, take, precedence, on, a, constitutional, level, in, the, common, variant, of, liberal, democracy, the, powers, of, the, majority, are, exercised, within, the, framework, of, a, representative, democracy, but, a, constitution, and, supreme, court, limit, the, majority, and, protect, the, minority, usually, through, securing, the, enjoyment, by, all, of, certain, individual, rights, such, as, freedom, of, speech, or, freedom, of, association, the, term, appeared, in, the, 5th, century, bc, in, greek, city, states, notably, classical, athens, to, mean, rule, of, the, people, in, contrast, to, aristocracy, aristokrat, a, meaning, rule, of, an, elite, western, democracy, as, distinct, from, that, which, existed, in, antiquity, is, generally, considered, to, have, originated, in, city, states, such, as, those, in, classical, athens, and, the, roman, republic, where, various, degrees, of, enfranchisement, of, the, free, male, population, were, observed, in, virtually, all, democratic, governments, throughout, ancient, and, modern, history, democratic, citizenship, was, initially, restricted, to, an, elite, class, which, was, later, extended, to, all, adult, citizens, in, most, modern, democracies, this, was, achieved, through, the, suffrage, movements, of, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, democracy, contrasts, with, forms, of, government, where, power, is, not, vested, in, the, general, population, of, a, state, such, as, authoritarian, systems, world, public, opinion, strongly, favors, democratic, systems, of, government, according, to, the, v, dem, democracy, indices, and, the, economist, democracy, index, less, than, half, the, world, s, population, lives, in, a, democracy, as, of, 2022, although, democracy, is, generally, understood, to, be, defined, by, voting, no, consensus, exists, on, a, precise, definition, of, democracy, karl, popper, says, that, the, classical, view, of, democracy, is, in, brief, the, theory, that, democracy, is, the, rule, of, the, people, and, that, the, people, have, a, right, to, rule, one, study, identified, 2, 234, adjectives, used, to, describe, democracy, in, the, english, language, democratic, principles, are, reflected, in, all, eligible, citizens, being, equal, before, the, law, and, having, equal, access, to, legislative, processes, for, example, in, a, representative, democracy, every, vote, has, in, theory, equal, weight, and, the, freedom, of, eligible, citizens, is, secured, by, legitimised, rights, and, liberties, which, are, typically, enshrined, in, a, constitution, while, other, uses, of, democracy, may, encompass, direct, democracy, in, which, citizens, vote, on, issues, directly, according, to, the, united, nations, democracy, provides, an, environment, that, respects, human, rights, and, fundamental, freedoms, and, in, which, the, freely, expressed, will, of, people, is, exercised, one, theory, holds, that, democracy, requires, three, fundamental, principles, upward, control, sovereignty, residing, at, the, lowest, levels, of, authority, political, equality, and, social, norms, by, which, individuals, and, institutions, only, consider, acceptable, acts, that, reflect, the, first, two, principles, of, upward, control, and, political, equality, legal, equality, political, freedom, and, rule, of, law, are, often, identified, by, commentators, as, foundational, characteristics, for, a, well, functioning, democracy, in, some, countries, notably, in, the, united, kingdom, which, originated, the, westminster, system, the, dominant, principle, is, that, of, parliamentary, sovereignty, while, maintaining, judicial, independence, in, india, parliamentary, sovereignty, is, subject, to, the, constitution, of, india, which, includes, judicial, review, though, the, term, democracy, is, typically, used, in, the, context, of, a, political, state, the, principles, also, are, potentially, applicable, to, private, organisations, such, as, clubs, societies, and, firms, democracies, may, use, many, different, decision, making, methods, but, majority, rule, is, the, dominant, form, without, compensation, like, legal, protections, of, individual, or, group, rights, political, minorities, can, be, oppressed, by, the, tyranny, of, the, majority, majority, rule, involves, a, competitive, approach, opposed, to, consensus, democracy, creating, the, need, that, elections, and, generally, deliberation, be, substantively, and, procedurally, fair, i, e, just, and, equitable, in, some, countries, freedom, of, political, expression, freedom, of, speech, and, freedom, of, the, press, are, considered, important, to, ensure, that, voters, are, well, informed, enabling, them, to, vote, according, to, their, own, interests, and, beliefs, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, a, basic, feature, of, democracy, is, the, capacity, of, all, voters, to, participate, freely, and, fully, in, the, life, of, their, society, with, its, emphasis, on, notions, of, social, contract, and, the, collective, will, of, all, the, voters, democracy, can, also, be, characterised, as, a, form, of, political, collectivism, because, it, is, defined, as, a, form, of, government, in, which, all, eligible, citizens, have, an, equal, say, in, lawmaking, republics, though, often, popularly, associated, with, democracy, because, of, the, shared, principle, of, rule, by, consent, of, the, governed, are, not, necessarily, democracies, as, republicanism, does, not, specify, how, the, people, are, to, rule, classically, the, term, republic, encompassed, both, democracies, and, aristocracies, in, a, modern, sense, the, republican, form, of, government, is, a, form, of, government, without, a, monarch, because, of, this, democracies, can, be, republics, or, constitutional, monarchies, such, as, the, united, kingdom, democratic, assemblies, are, as, old, as, the, human, species, and, are, found, throughout, human, history, but, up, until, the, nineteenth, century, major, political, figures, have, largely, opposed, democracy, republican, theorists, linked, democracy, to, small, size, as, political, units, grew, in, size, the, likelihood, increased, that, the, government, would, turn, despotic, at, the, same, time, small, political, units, were, vulnerable, to, conquest, montesquieu, wrote, if, a, republic, be, small, it, is, destroyed, by, a, foreign, force, if, it, be, large, it, is, ruined, by, an, internal, imperfection, according, to, johns, hopkins, university, political, scientist, daniel, deudney, the, creation, of, the, united, states, with, its, large, size, and, its, system, of, checks, and, balances, was, a, solution, to, the, dual, problems, of, size, forms, of, democracy, occurred, organically, in, societies, around, the, world, that, had, no, contact, with, each, other, retrospectively, different, polities, outside, of, declared, democracies, have, been, described, as, proto, democratic, the, term, democracy, first, appeared, in, ancient, greek, political, and, philosophical, thought, in, the, city, state, of, athens, during, classical, antiquity, the, word, comes, from, d, mos, common, people, and, kr, tos, force, might, under, cleisthenes, what, is, generally, held, as, the, first, example, of, a, type, of, democracy, in, 508, 507, bc, was, established, in, athens, cleisthenes, is, referred, to, as, the, father, of, athenian, democracy, the, first, attested, use, of, the, word, democracy, is, found, in, prose, works, of, the, 430s, bc, such, as, herodotus, histories, but, its, usage, was, older, by, several, decades, as, two, athenians, born, in, the, 470s, were, named, democrates, a, new, political, name, likely, in, support, of, democracy, given, at, a, time, of, debates, over, constitutional, issues, in, athens, aeschylus, also, strongly, alludes, to, the, word, in, his, play, the, suppliants, staged, in, c, 463, bc, where, he, mentions, the, demos, s, ruling, hand, before, that, time, the, word, used, to, define, the, new, political, system, of, cleisthenes, was, probably, isonomia, meaning, political, equality, athenian, democracy, took, the, form, of, a, direct, democracy, and, it, had, two, distinguishing, features, the, random, selection, of, ordinary, citizens, to, fill, the, few, existing, government, administrative, and, judicial, offices, and, a, legislative, assembly, consisting, of, all, athenian, citizens, all, eligible, citizens, were, allowed, to, speak, and, vote, in, the, assembly, which, set, the, laws, of, the, city, state, however, athenian, citizenship, excluded, women, slaves, foreigners, m, toikoi, and, youths, below, the, age, of, military, service, effectively, only, 1, in, 4, residents, in, athens, qualified, as, citizens, owning, land, was, not, a, requirement, for, citizenship, the, exclusion, of, large, parts, of, the, population, from, the, citizen, body, is, closely, related, to, the, ancient, understanding, of, citizenship, in, most, of, antiquity, the, benefit, of, citizenship, was, tied, to, the, obligation, to, fight, war, campaigns, athenian, democracy, was, not, only, direct, in, the, sense, that, decisions, were, made, by, the, assembled, people, but, also, the, most, direct, in, the, sense, that, the, people, through, the, assembly, boule, and, courts, of, law, controlled, the, entire, political, process, and, a, large, proportion, of, citizens, were, involved, constantly, in, the, public, business, even, though, the, rights, of, the, individual, were, not, secured, by, the, athenian, constitution, in, the, modern, sense, the, ancient, greeks, had, no, word, for, rights, those, who, were, citizens, of, athens, enjoyed, their, liberties, not, in, opposition, to, the, government, but, by, living, in, a, city, that, was, not, subject, to, another, power, and, by, not, being, subjects, themselves, to, the, rule, of, another, person, range, voting, appeared, in, sparta, as, early, as, 700, bc, the, spartan, ecclesia, was, an, assembly, of, the, people, held, once, a, month, in, which, every, male, citizen, of, at, least, 20, years, of, age, could, participate, in, the, assembly, spartans, elected, leaders, and, cast, votes, by, range, voting, and, shouting, the, vote, is, then, decided, on, how, loudly, the, crowd, shouts, aristotle, called, this, childish, as, compared, with, the, stone, voting, ballots, used, by, the, athenian, citizenry, sparta, adopted, it, because, of, its, simplicity, and, to, prevent, any, biased, voting, buying, or, cheating, that, was, predominant, in, the, early, democratic, elections, even, though, the, roman, republic, contributed, significantly, to, many, aspects, of, democracy, only, a, minority, of, romans, were, citizens, with, votes, in, elections, for, representatives, the, votes, of, the, powerful, were, given, more, weight, through, a, system, of, weighted, voting, so, most, high, officials, including, members, of, the, senate, came, from, a, few, wealthy, and, noble, families, in, addition, the, overthrow, of, the, roman, kingdom, was, the, first, case, in, the, western, world, of, a, polity, being, formed, with, the, explicit, purpose, of, being, a, republic, although, it, didn, t, have, much, of, a, democracy, the, roman, model, of, governance, inspired, many, political, thinkers, over, the, centuries, vaishali, capital, city, of, the, vajjika, league, vrijji, mahajanapada, of, india, is, considered, one, of, the, first, examples, of, a, republic, around, the, 6th, century, bc, other, cultures, such, as, the, iroquois, in, the, americas, also, developed, a, form, of, democratic, society, between, 1450, and, 1660, and, possibly, in, 1142, well, before, contact, with, the, europeans, this, democracy, continues, to, the, present, day, and, is, the, world, s, oldest, standing, representative, democracy, while, most, regions, in, europe, during, the, middle, ages, were, ruled, by, clergy, or, feudal, lords, there, existed, various, systems, involving, elections, or, assemblies, although, often, only, involving, a, small, part, of, the, population, in, scandinavia, bodies, known, as, things, consisted, of, freemen, presided, by, a, lawspeaker, these, deliberative, bodies, were, responsible, for, settling, political, questions, and, variants, included, the, althing, in, iceland, and, the, l, gting, in, the, faeroe, islands, the, veche, found, in, eastern, europe, was, a, similar, body, to, the, scandinavian, thing, in, the, roman, catholic, church, the, pope, has, been, elected, by, a, papal, conclave, composed, of, cardinals, since, 1059, the, first, documented, parliamentary, body, in, europe, was, the, cortes, of, le, n, established, by, alfonso, ix, in, 1188, the, cortes, had, authority, over, setting, taxation, foreign, affairs, and, legislating, though, the, exact, nature, of, its, role, remains, disputed, the, republic, of, ragusa, established, in, 1358, and, centered, around, the, city, of, dubrovnik, provided, representation, and, voting, rights, to, its, male, aristocracy, only, various, italian, city, states, and, polities, had, republic, forms, of, government, for, instance, the, republic, of, florence, established, in, 1115, was, led, by, the, signoria, whose, members, were, chosen, by, sortition, in, 10th, 15th, century, frisia, a, distinctly, non, feudal, society, the, right, to, vote, on, local, matters, and, on, county, officials, was, based, on, land, size, the, kouroukan, fouga, divided, the, mali, empire, into, ruling, clans, lineages, that, were, represented, at, a, great, assembly, called, the, gbara, however, the, charter, made, mali, more, similar, to, a, constitutional, monarchy, than, a, democratic, republic, the, parliament, of, england, had, its, roots, in, the, restrictions, on, the, power, of, kings, written, into, magna, carta, 1215, which, explicitly, protected, certain, rights, of, the, king, s, subjects, and, implicitly, supported, what, became, the, english, writ, of, habeas, corpus, safeguarding, individual, freedom, against, unlawful, imprisonment, with, right, to, appeal, the, first, representative, national, assembly, in, england, was, simon, de, montfort, s, parliament, in, 1265, the, emergence, of, petitioning, is, some, of, the, earliest, evidence, of, parliament, being, used, as, a, forum, to, address, the, general, grievances, of, ordinary, people, however, the, power, to, call, parliament, remained, at, the, pleasure, of, the, monarch, studies, have, linked, the, emergence, of, parliamentary, institutions, in, europe, during, the, medieval, period, to, urban, agglomeration, and, the, creation, of, new, classes, such, as, artisans, as, well, as, the, presence, of, nobility, and, religious, elites, scholars, have, also, linked, the, emergence, of, representative, government, to, europe, s, relative, political, fragmentation, political, scientist, david, stasavage, links, the, fragmentation, of, europe, and, its, subsequent, democratization, to, the, manner, in, which, the, roman, empire, collapsed, roman, territory, was, conquered, by, small, fragmented, groups, of, germanic, tribes, thus, leading, to, the, creation, of, small, political, units, where, rulers, were, relatively, weak, and, needed, the, consent, of, the, governed, to, ward, off, foreign, threats, in, poland, noble, democracy, was, characterized, by, an, increase, in, the, activity, of, the, middle, nobility, which, wanted, to, increase, their, share, in, exercising, power, at, the, expense, of, the, magnates, magnates, dominated, the, most, important, offices, in, the, state, secular, and, ecclesiastical, and, sat, on, the, royal, council, later, the, senate, the, growing, importance, of, the, middle, nobility, had, an, impact, on, the, establishment, of, the, institution, of, the, land, sejmik, local, assembly, which, subsequently, obtained, more, rights, during, the, fifteenth, and, first, half, of, the, sixteenth, century, sejmiks, received, more, and, more, powers, and, became, the, most, important, institutions, of, local, power, in, 1454, casimir, iv, jagiellon, granted, the, sejmiks, the, right, to, decide, on, taxes, and, to, convene, a, mass, mobilization, in, the, nieszawa, statutes, he, also, pledged, not, to, create, new, laws, without, their, consent, in, 17th, century, england, there, was, renewed, interest, in, magna, carta, the, parliament, of, england, passed, the, petition, of, right, in, 1628, which, established, certain, liberties, for, subjects, the, english, civil, war, 1642, 1651, was, fought, between, the, king, and, an, oligarchic, but, elected, parliament, during, which, the, idea, of, a, political, party, took, form, with, groups, debating, rights, to, political, representation, during, the, putney, debates, of, 1647, subsequently, the, protectorate, 1653, 59, and, the, english, restoration, 1660, restored, more, autocratic, rule, although, parliament, passed, the, habeas, corpus, act, in, 1679, which, strengthened, the, convention, that, forbade, detention, lacking, sufficient, cause, or, evidence, after, the, glorious, revolution, of, 1688, the, bill, of, rights, was, enacted, in, 1689, which, codified, certain, rights, and, liberties, and, is, still, in, effect, the, bill, set, out, the, requirement, for, regular, elections, rules, for, freedom, of, speech, in, parliament, and, limited, the, power, of, the, monarch, ensuring, that, unlike, much, of, europe, at, the, time, royal, absolutism, would, not, prevail, economic, historians, douglass, north, and, barry, weingast, have, characterized, the, institutions, implemented, in, the, glorious, revolution, as, a, resounding, success, in, terms, of, restraining, the, government, and, ensuring, protection, for, property, rights, renewed, interest, in, the, magna, carta, the, english, civil, war, and, the, glorious, revolution, in, the, 17th, century, prompted, the, growth, of, political, philosophy, on, the, british, isles, thomas, hobbes, was, the, first, philosopher, to, articulate, a, detailed, social, contract, theory, writing, in, the, leviathan, 1651, hobbes, theorized, that, individuals, living, in, the, state, of, nature, led, lives, that, were, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and, short, and, constantly, waged, a, war, of, all, against, all, in, order, to, prevent, the, occurrence, of, an, anarchic, state, of, nature, hobbes, reasoned, that, individuals, ceded, their, rights, to, a, strong, authoritarian, power, in, other, words, hobbes, advocated, for, an, absolute, monarchy, which, in, his, opinion, was, the, best, form, of, government, later, philosopher, and, physician, john, locke, would, posit, a, different, interpretation, of, social, contract, theory, writing, in, his, two, treatises, of, government, 1689, locke, posited, that, all, individuals, possessed, the, inalienable, rights, to, life, liberty, and, estate, property, according, to, locke, individuals, would, voluntarily, come, together, to, form, a, state, for, the, purposes, of, defending, their, rights, particularly, important, for, locke, were, property, rights, whose, protection, locke, deemed, to, be, a, government, s, primary, purpose, furthermore, locke, asserted, that, governments, were, legitimate, only, if, they, held, the, consent, of, the, governed, for, locke, citizens, had, the, right, to, revolt, against, a, government, that, acted, against, their, interest, or, became, tyrannical, although, they, were, not, widely, read, during, his, lifetime, locke, s, works, are, considered, the, founding, documents, of, liberal, thought, and, profoundly, influenced, the, leaders, of, the, american, revolution, and, later, the, french, revolution, his, liberal, democratic, framework, of, governance, remains, the, preeminent, form, of, democracy, in, the, world, in, the, cossack, republics, of, ukraine, in, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, the, cossack, hetmanate, and, zaporizhian, sich, the, holder, of, the, highest, post, of, hetman, was, elected, by, the, representatives, from, the, country, s, districts, in, north, america, representative, government, began, in, jamestown, virginia, with, the, election, of, the, house, of, burgesses, forerunner, of, the, virginia, general, assembly, in, 1619, english, puritans, who, migrated, from, 1620, established, colonies, in, new, england, whose, local, governance, was, democratic, although, these, local, assemblies, had, some, small, amounts, of, devolved, power, the, ultimate, authority, was, held, by, the, crown, and, the, english, parliament, the, puritans, pilgrim, fathers, baptists, and, quakers, who, founded, these, colonies, applied, the, democratic, organisation, of, their, congregations, also, to, the, administration, of, their, communities, in, worldly, matters, the, first, parliament, of, great, britain, was, established, in, 1707, after, the, merger, of, the, kingdom, of, england, and, the, kingdom, of, scotland, under, the, acts, of, union, two, key, documents, of, the, uk, s, uncodified, constitution, the, english, declaration, of, right, 1689, restated, in, the, bill, of, rights, 1689, and, the, scottish, claim, of, right, 1689, had, both, cemented, parliament, s, position, as, the, supreme, law, making, body, and, said, that, the, election, of, members, of, parliament, ought, to, be, free, however, parliament, was, only, elected, by, male, property, owners, which, amounted, to, 3, of, the, population, in, 1780, the, first, known, british, person, of, african, heritage, to, vote, in, a, general, election, ignatius, sancho, voted, in, 1774, and, 1780, during, the, age, of, liberty, in, sweden, 1718, 1772, civil, rights, were, expanded, and, power, shifted, from, the, monarch, to, parliament, the, taxed, peasantry, was, represented, in, parliament, although, with, little, influence, but, commoners, without, taxed, property, had, no, suffrage, the, creation, of, the, short, lived, corsican, republic, in, 1755, was, an, early, attempt, to, adopt, a, democratic, constitution, all, men, and, women, above, age, of, 25, could, vote, this, corsican, constitution, was, the, first, based, on, enlightenment, principles, and, included, female, suffrage, something, that, was, not, included, in, most, other, democracies, until, the, 20th, century, colonial, america, had, similar, property, qualifications, as, britain, and, in, the, period, before, 1776, the, abundance, and, availability, of, land, meant, that, large, numbers, of, colonists, met, such, requirements, with, at, least, 60, per, cent, of, adult, white, males, able, to, vote, the, great, majority, of, white, men, were, farmers, who, met, the, property, ownership, or, taxpaying, requirements, with, few, exceptions, no, blacks, or, women, could, vote, vermont, which, on, declaring, independence, of, great, britain, in, 1777, adopted, a, constitution, modelled, on, pennsylvania, s, with, citizenship, and, democratic, suffrage, for, males, with, or, without, property, the, united, states, constitution, of, 1787, is, the, oldest, surviving, still, active, governmental, codified, constitution, the, constitution, provided, for, an, elected, government, and, protected, civil, rights, and, liberties, but, did, not, end, slavery, nor, extend, voting, rights, in, the, united, states, instead, leaving, the, issue, of, suffrage, to, the, individual, states, generally, states, limited, suffrage, to, white, male, property, owners, and, taxpayers, at, the, time, of, the, first, presidential, election, in, 1789, about, 6, of, the, population, was, eligible, to, vote, the, naturalization, act, of, 1790, limited, u, s, citizenship, to, whites, only, the, bill, of, rights, in, 1791, set, limits, on, government,

declaration, of, the, rights, of, man, and, of, the, citizen, and, although, short, lived, the, national, convention, was, elected, by, all, men, in, 1792, the, polish, lithuanian, constitution, of, 3, may, 1791, sought, to, implement, a, more, effective, constitutional, monarchy, introduced, political, equality, between, townspeople, and, nobility, and, placed, the, peasants, under, the, protection, of, the, government, mitigating, the, worst, abuses, of, serfdom, in, force, for, less, than, 19, months, it, was, declared, null, and, void, by, the, grodno, sejm, that, met, in, 1793, nonetheless, the, 1791, constitution, helped, keep, alive, polish, aspirations, for, the, eventual, restoration, of, the, country, s, sovereignty, over, a, century, later, in, the, united, states,

reaching, about, 80, of, the, adult, white, male, population, in, the, 1840, presidential, election, north, carolina, was, the, last, state, to, abolish, property, qualification, in, 1856, resulting, in, a, close, approximation, to, universal, white, male, suffrage, however, tax, paying, requirements, remained, in, five, states, in, 1860, and, survived, in, two, states, until, the, 20th, century, in, the, 1860, united, states, census, the, slave, population, had, grown, to, four, million, and, in, reconstruction, after, the, civil, war, three, constitutional, amendments, were, passed, the, 13th, amendment, 1865, that, ended, slavery, the, 14th, amendment, 1869, that, gave, black, people, citizenship, and, the, 15th, amendment, 1870, that, gave, black, males, a, nominal, right, to, vote, full, enfranchisement, of, citizens, was, not, secured, until, after, the, civil, rights, movement, gained, passage, by, the, us, congress, of, the, voting, rights, act, of, 1965, the, voting, franchise, in, the, united, kingdom, was, expanded, and, made, more, uniform, in, a, series, of, reforms, that, began, with, the, reform, act, 1832, and, continued, into, the, 20th, century, notably, with, the, representation, of, the, people, act, 1918, and, the, equal, franchise, act, 1928, universal, male, suffrage, was, established, in, france, in, march, 1848, in, the, wake, of, the, french, revolution, of, 1848, during, that, year, several, revolutions, broke, out, in, europe, as, rulers, were, confronted, with, popular, demands, for, liberal, constitutions, and, more, democratic, government, in, 1876, the, ottoman, empire, transitioned, from, an, absolute, monarchy, to, a, constitutional, one, and, held, two, elections, the, next, year, to, elect, members, to, her, newly, formed, parliament, provisional, electoral, regulations, were, issued, stating, that, the, elected, members, of, the, provincial, administrative, councils, would, elect, members, to, the, first, parliament, later, that, year, a, new, constitution, was, promulgated, which, provided, for, a, bicameral, parliament, with, a, senate, appointed, by, the, sultan, and, a, popularly, elected, chamber, of, deputies, only, men, above, the, age, of, 30, who, were, competent, in, turkish, and, had, full, civil, rights, were, allowed, to, stand, for, election, reasons, for, disqualification, included, holding, dual, citizenship, being, employed, by, a, foreign, government, being, bankrupt, employed, as, a, servant, or, having, notoriety, for, ill, deeds, full, universal, suffrage, was, achieved, in, 1934, in, 1893, the, self, governing, colony, new, zealand, became, the, first, country, in, the, world, except, for, the, short, lived, 18th, century, corsican, republic, to, establish, active, universal, suffrage, by, recognizing, women, as, having, the, right, to, vote, 20th, century, transitions, to, liberal, democracy, have, come, in, successive, waves, of, democracy, variously, resulting, from, wars, revolutions, decolonisation, and, religious, and, economic, circumstances, global, waves, of, democratic, regression, reversing, democratization, have, also, occurred, in, the, 1920s, and, 30s, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, and, in, the, 2010s, world, war, i, and, the, dissolution, of, the, autocratic, ottoman, and, austro, hungarian, empires, resulted, in, the, creation, of, new, nation, states, in, europe, most, of, them, at, least, nominally, democratic, in, the, 1920s, democratic, movements, flourished, and, women, s, suffrage, advanced, but, the, great, depression, brought, disenchantment, and, most, of, the, countries, of, europe, latin, america, and, asia, turned, to, strong, man, rule, or, dictatorships, fascism, and, dictatorships, flourished, in, nazi, germany, italy, spain, and, portugal, as, well, as, non, democratic, governments, in, the, baltics, the, balkans, brazil, cuba, china, and, japan, among, others, world, war, ii, brought, a, definitive, reversal, of, this, trend, in, western, europe, the, democratisation, of, the, american, british, and, french, sectors, of, occupied, germany, disputed, austria, italy, and, the, occupied, japan, served, as, a, model, for, the, later, theory, of, government, change, however, most, of, eastern, europe, including, the, soviet, sector, of, germany, fell, into, the, non, democratic, soviet, dominated, bloc, the, war, was, followed, by, decolonisation, and, again, most, of, the, new, independent, states, had, nominally, democratic, constitutions, india, emerged, as, the, world, s, largest, democracy, and, continues, to, be, so, countries, that, were, once, part, of, the, british, empire, often, adopted, the, british, westminster, system, in, 1948, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, mandated, democracy, 3, the, will, of, the, people, shall, be, the, basis, of, the, authority, of, government, this, will, shall, be, expressed, in, periodic, and, genuine, elections, which, shall, be, by, universal, and, equal, suffrage, and, shall, be, held, by, secret, vote, or, by, equivalent, free, voting, procedures, by, 1960, the, vast, majority, of, country, states, were, nominally, democracies, although, most, of, the, world, s, populations, lived, in, nominal, democracies, that, experienced, sham, elections, and, other, forms, of, subterfuge, particularly, in, communist, states, and, the, former, colonies, a, subsequent, wave, of, democratisation, brought, substantial, gains, toward, true, liberal, democracy, for, many, states, dubbed, third, wave, of, democracy, portugal, spain, and, several, of, the, military, dictatorships, in, south, america, returned, to, civilian, rule, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, this, was, followed, by, countries, in, east, and, south, asia, by, the, mid, to, late, 1980s, economic, malaise, in, the, 1980s, along, with, resentment, of, soviet, oppression, contributed, to, the, collapse, of, the, soviet, union, the, associated, end, of, the, cold, war, and, the, democratisation, and, liberalisation, of, the, former, eastern, bloc, countries, the, most, successful, of, the, new, democracies, were, those, geographically, and, culturally, closest, to, western, europe, and, they, are, now, either, part, of, the, european, union, or, candidate, states, in, 1986, after, the, toppling, of, the, most, prominent, asian, dictatorship, the, only, democratic, state, of, its, kind, at, the, time, emerged, in, the, philippines, with, the, rise, of, corazon, aquino, who, would, later, be, known, as, the, mother, of, asian, democracy, the, liberal, trend, spread, to, some, states, in, africa, in, the, 1990s, most, prominently, in, south, africa, some, recent, examples, of, attempts, of, liberalisation, include, the, indonesian, revolution, of, 1998, the, bulldozer, revolution, in, yugoslavia, the, rose, revolution, in, georgia, the, orange, revolution, in, ukraine, the, cedar, revolution, in, lebanon, the, tulip, revolution, in, kyrgyzstan, and, the, jasmine, revolution, in, tunisia, according, to, freedom, house, in, 2007, there, were, 123, electoral, democracies, up, from, 40, in, 1972, according, to, world, forum, on, democracy, electoral, democracies, now, represent, 120, of, the, 192, existing, countries, and, constitute, 58, 2, per, cent, of, the, world, s, population, at, the, same, time, liberal, democracies, i, e, countries, freedom, house, regards, as, free, and, respectful, of, basic, human, rights, and, the, rule, of, law, are, 85, in, number, and, represent, 38, per, cent, of, the, global, population, also, in, 2007, the, united, nations, declared, 15, september, the, international, day, of, democracy, many, countries, reduced, their, voting, age, to, 18, years, the, major, democracies, began, to, do, so, in, the, 1970s, starting, in, western, europe, and, north, america, most, electoral, democracies, continue, to, exclude, those, younger, than, 18, from, voting, the, voting, age, has, been, lowered, to, 16, for, national, elections, in, a, number, of, countries, including, brazil, austria, cuba, and, nicaragua, in, california, a, 2004, proposal, to, permit, a, quarter, vote, at, 14, and, a, half, vote, at, 16, was, ultimately, defeated, in, 2008, the, german, parliament, proposed, but, shelved, a, bill, that, would, grant, the, vote, to, each, citizen, at, birth, to, be, used, by, a, parent, until, the, child, claims, it, for, themselves, according, to, freedom, house, starting, in, 2005, there, have, been, 17, consecutive, years, in, which, declines, in, political, rights, and, civil, liberties, throughout, the, world, have, outnumbered, improvements, as, populist, and, nationalist, political, forces, have, gained, ground, everywhere, from, poland, under, the, law, and, justice, party, to, the, philippines, under, rodrigo, duterte, in, a, freedom, house, report, released, in, 2018, democracy, scores, for, most, countries, declined, for, the, 12th, consecutive, year, the, christian, science, monitor, reported, that, nationalist, and, populist, political, ideologies, were, gaining, ground, at, the, expense, of, rule, of, law, in, countries, like, poland, turkey, and, hungary, for, example, in, poland, the, president, appointed, 27, new, supreme, court, judges, over, legal, objections, from, the, european, commission, in, turkey, thousands, of, judges, were, removed, from, their, positions, following, a, failed, coup, attempt, during, a, government, crackdown, democratic, backsliding, in, the, 2010s, were, attributed, to, economic, inequality, and, social, discontent, personalism, poor, government, s, management, of, the, covid, 19, pandemic, as, well, as, other, factors, such, as, manipulation, of, civil, society, toxic, polarization, foreign, disinformation, campaigns, racism, and, nativism, excessive, executive, power, and, decreased, power, of, the, opposition, within, english, speaking, western, democracies, protection, based, attitudes, combining, cultural, conservatism, and, leftist, economic, attitudes, were, the, strongest, predictor, of, support, for, authoritarian, modes, of, governance, aristotle, contrasted, rule, by, the, many, democracy, timocracy, with, rule, by, the, few, oligarchy, aristocracy, and, with, rule, by, a, single, person, tyranny, or, today, autocracy, absolute, monarchy, he, also, thought, that, there, was, a, good, and, a, bad, variant, of, each, system, he, considered, democracy, to, be, the, degenerate, counterpart, to, timocracy, a, common, view, among, early, and, renaissance, republican, theorists, was, that, democracy, could, only, survive, in, small, political, communities, heeding, the, lessons, of, the, roman, republic, s, shift, to, monarchism, as, it, grew, larger, or, smaller, these, republican, theorists, held, that, the, expansion, of, territory, and, population, inevitably, led, to, tyranny, democracy, was, therefore, highly, fragile, and, rare, historically, as, it, could, only, survive, in, small, political, units, which, due, to, their, size, were, vulnerable, to, conquest, by, larger, political, units, montesquieu, famously, said, if, a, republic, is, small, it, is, destroyed, by, an, outside, force, if, it, is, large, it, is, destroyed, by, an, internal, vice, rousseau, asserted, it, is, therefore, the, natural, property, of, small, states, to, be, governed, as, a, republic, of, middling, ones, to, be, subject, to, a, monarch, and, of, large, empires, to, be, swayed, by, a, despotic, prince, among, modern, political, theorists, there, are, three, contending, conceptions, of, democracy, aggregative, democracy, deliberative, democracy, and, radical, democracy, the, theory, of, aggregative, democracy, claims, that, the, aim, of, the, democratic, processes, is, to, solicit, citizens, preferences, and, aggregate, them, together, to, determine, what, social, policies, society, should, adopt, therefore, proponents, of, this, view, hold, that, democratic, participation, should, primarily, focus, on, voting, where, the, policy, with, the, most, votes, gets, implemented, different, variants, of, aggregative, democracy, exist, under, minimalism, democracy, is, a, system, of, government, in, which, citizens, have, given, teams, of, political, leaders, the, right, to, rule, in, periodic, elections, according, to, this, minimalist, conception, citizens, cannot, and, should, not, rule, because, for, example, on, most, issues, most, of, the, time, they, have, no, clear, views, or, their, views, are, not, well, founded, joseph, schumpeter, articulated, this, view, most, famously, in, his, book, capitalism, socialism, and, democracy, contemporary, proponents, of, minimalism, include, william, h, riker, adam, przeworski, richard, posner, according, to, the, theory, of, direct, democracy, on, the, other, hand, citizens, should, vote, directly, not, through, their, representatives, on, legislative, proposals, proponents, of, direct, democracy, offer, varied, reasons, to, support, this, view, political, activity, can, be, valuable, in, itself, it, socialises, and, educates, citizens, and, popular, participation, can, check, powerful, elites, most, importantly, citizens, do, not, rule, themselves, unless, they, directly, decide, laws, and, policies, governments, will, tend, to, produce, laws, and, policies, that, are, close, to, the, views, of, the, median, voter, with, half, to, their, left, and, the, other, half, to, their, right, this, is, not, a, desirable, outcome, as, it, represents, the, action, of, self, interested, and, somewhat, unaccountable, political, elites, competing, for, votes, anthony, downs, suggests, that, ideological, political, parties, are, necessary, to, act, as, a, mediating, broker, between, individual, and, governments, downs, laid, out, this, view, in, his, 1957, book, an, economic, theory, of, democracy, robert, a, dahl, argues, that, the, fundamental, democratic, principle, is, that, when, it, comes, to, binding, collective, decisions, each, person, in, a, political, community, is, entitled, to, have, his, her, interests, be, given, equal, consideration, not, necessarily, that, all, people, are, equally, satisfied, by, the, collective, decision, he, uses, the, term, polyarchy, to, refer, to, societies, in, which, there, exists, a, certain, set, of, institutions, and, procedures, which, are, perceived, as, leading, to, such, democracy, first, and, foremost, among, these, institutions, is, the, regular, occurrence, of, free, and, open, elections, which, are, used, to, select, representatives, who, then, manage, all, or, most, of, the, public, policy, of, the, society, however, these, polyarchic, procedures, may, not, create, a, full, democracy, if, for, example, poverty, prevents, political, participation, similarly, ronald, dworkin, argues, that, democracy, is, a, substantive, not, a, merely, procedural, ideal, deliberative, democracy, is, based, on, the, notion, that, democracy, is, government, by, deliberation, unlike, aggregative, democracy, deliberative, democracy, holds, that, for, a, democratic, decision, to, be, legitimate, it, must, be, preceded, by, authentic, deliberation, not, merely, the, aggregation, of, preferences, that, occurs, in, voting, authentic, deliberation, is, deliberation, among, decision, makers, that, is, free, from, distortions, of, unequal, political, power, such, as, power, a, decision, maker, obtained, through, economic, wealth, or, the, support, of, interest, groups, if, the, decision, makers, cannot, reach, consensus, after, authentically, deliberating, on, a, proposal, then, they, vote, on, the, proposal, using, a, form, of, majority, rule, citizens, assemblies, are, considered, by, many, scholars, as, practical, examples, of, deliberative, democracy, with, a, recent, oecd, report, identifying, citizens, assemblies, as, an, increasingly, popular, mechanism, to, involve, citizens, in, governmental, decision, making, radical, democracy, is, based, on, the, idea, that, there, are, hierarchical, and, oppressive, power, relations, that, exist, in, society, democracy, s, role, is, to, make, visible, and, challenge, those, relations, by, allowing, for, difference, dissent, and, antagonisms, in, decision, making, processes, democracy, indices, are, quantitative, and, comparative, assessments, of, the, state, of, democracy, for, different, countries, according, to, various, definitions, of, democracy, the, democracies, indices, differ, in, whether, they, are, categorical, such, as, classifying, countries, into, democracies, hybrid, regimes, and, autocracies, or, continuous, values, the, qualitative, nature, of, democracy, indices, enables, data, analytical, approaches, for, studying, causal, mechanisms, of, regime, transformation, processes, democracy, has, taken, a, number, of, forms, both, in, theory, and, practice, some, varieties, of, democracy, provide, better, representation, and, more, freedom, for, their, citizens, than, others, however, if, any, democracy, is, not, structured, to, prohibit, the, government, from, excluding, the, people, from, the, legislative, process, or, any, branch, of, government, from, altering, the, separation, of, powers, in, its, favour, then, a, branch, of, the, system, can, accumulate, too, much, power, and, destroy, the, democracy, the, following, kinds, of, democracy, are, not, exclusive, of, one, another, many, specify, details, of, aspects, that, are, independent, of, one, another, and, can, co, exist, in, a, single, system, several, variants, of, democracy, exist, but, there, are, two, basic, forms, both, of, which, concern, how, the, whole, body, of, all, eligible, citizens, executes, its, will, one, form, of, democracy, is, direct, democracy, in, which, all, eligible, citizens, have, active, participation, in, the, political, decision, making, for, example, voting, on, policy, initiatives, directly, in, most, modern, democracies, the, whole, body, of, eligible, citizens, remain, the, sovereign, power, but, political, power, is, exercised, indirectly, through, elected, representatives, this, is, called, a, representative, democracy, direct, democracy, is, a, political, system, where, the, citizens, participate, in, the, decision, making, personally, contrary, to, relying, on, intermediaries, or, representatives, a, direct, democracy, gives, the, voting, population, the, power, to, within, modern, day, representative, governments, certain, electoral, tools, like, referendums, citizens, initiatives, and, recall, elections, are, referred, to, as, forms, of, direct, democracy, however, some, advocates, of, direct, democracy, argue, for, local, assemblies, of, face, to, face, discussion, direct, democracy, as, a, government, system, currently, exists, in, the, swiss, cantons, of, appenzell, innerrhoden, and, glarus, the, rebel, zapatista, autonomous, municipalities, communities, affiliated, with, the, cipo, rfm, the, bolivian, city, councils, of, fejuve, and, kurdish, cantons, of, rojava, some, modern, democracies, that, are, predominantly, representative, in, nature, also, heavily, rely, upon, forms, of, political, action, that, are, directly, democratic, these, democracies, which, combine, elements, of, representative, democracy, and, direct, democracy, are, termed, semi, direct, democracies, or, participatory, democracies, examples, include, switzerland, and, some, u, s, states, where, frequent, use, is, made, of, referendums, and, initiatives, the, swiss, confederation, is, a, semi, direct, democracy, at, the, federal, level, citizens, can, propose, changes, to, the, constitution, federal, popular, initiative, or, ask, for, a, referendum, to, be, held, on, any, law, voted, by, the, parliament, between, january, 1995, and, june, 2005, swiss, citizens, voted, 31, times, to, answer, 103, questions, during, the, same, period, french, citizens, participated, in, only, two, referendums, although, in, the, past, 120, years, less, than, 250, initiatives, have, been, put, to, referendum, examples, include, the, extensive, use, of, referendums, in, the, us, state, of, california, which, is, a, state, that, has, more, than, 20, million, voters, in, new, england, town, meetings, are, often, used, especially, in, rural, areas, to, manage, local, government, this, creates, a, hybrid, form, of, government, with, a, local, direct, democracy, and, a, representative, state, government, for, example, most, vermont, towns, hold, annual, town, meetings, in, march, in, which, town, officers, are, elected, budgets, for, the, town, and, schools, are, voted, on, and, citizens, have, the, opportunity, to, speak, and, be, heard, on, political, matters, the, use, of, a, lot, system, a, characteristic, of, athenian, democracy, is, a, feature, of, some, versions, of, direct, democracies, in, this, system, important, governmental, and, administrative, tasks, are, performed, by, citizens, picked, from, a, lottery, representative, democracy, involves, the, election, of, government, officials, by, the, people, being, represented, if, the, head, of, state, is, also, democratically, elected, then, it, is, called, a, democratic, republic, the, most, common, mechanisms, involve, election, of, the, candidate, with, a, majority, or, a, plurality, of, the, votes, most, western, countries, have, representative, systems, representatives, may, be, elected, or, become, diplomatic, representatives, by, a, particular, district, or, constituency, or, represent, the, entire, electorate, through, proportional, systems, with, some, using, a, combination, of, the, two, some, representative, democracies, also, incorporate, elements, of, direct, democracy, such, as, referendums, a, characteristic, of, representative, democracy, is, that, while, the, representatives, are, elected, by, the, people, to, act, in, the, people, s, interest, they, retain, the, freedom, to, exercise, their, own, judgement, as, how, best, to, do, so, such, reasons, have, driven, criticism, upon, representative, democracy, pointing, out, the, contradictions, of, representation, mechanisms, with, democracy, parliamentary, democracy, is, a, representative, democracy, where, government, is, appointed, by, or, can, be, dismissed, by, representatives, as, opposed, to, a, presidential, rule, wherein, the, president, is, both, head, of, state, and, the, head, of, government, and, is, elected, by, the, voters, under, a, parliamentary, democracy, government, is, exercised, by, delegation, to, an, executive, ministry, and, subject, to, ongoing, review, checks, and, balances, by, the, legislative, parliament, elected, by, the, people, in, a, parliamentary, system, the, prime, minister, may, be, dismissed, by, the, legislature, at, any, point, in, time, for, not, meeting, the, expectations, of, the, legislature, this, is, done, through, a, vote, of, no, confidence, where, the, legislature, decides, whether, or, not, to, remove, the, prime, minister, from, office, with, majority, support, for, dismissal, in, some, countries, the, prime, minister, can, also, call, an, election, at, any, point, in, time, typically, when, the, prime, minister, believes, that, they, are, in, good, favour, with, the, public, as, to, get, re, elected, in, other, parliamentary, democracies, extra, elections, are, virtually, never, held, a, minority, government, being, preferred, until, the, next, ordinary, elections, an, important, feature, of, the, parliamentary, democracy, is, the, concept, of, the, loyal, opposition, the, essence, of, the, concept, is, that, the, second, largest, political, party, or, opposition, opposes, the, governing, party, or, coalition, while, still, remaining, loyal, to, the, state, and, its, democratic, principles, presidential, democracy, is, a, system, where, the, public, elects, the, president, through, an, election, the, president, serves, as, both, the, head, of, state, and, head, of, government, controlling, most, of, the, executive, powers, the, president, serves, for, a, specific, term, and, cannot, exceed, that, amount, of, time, the, legislature, often, has, limited, ability, to, remove, a, president, from, office, elections, typically, have, a, fixed, date, and, aren, t, easily, changed, the, president, has, direct, control, over, the, cabinet, specifically, appointing, the, cabinet, members, the, executive, usually, has, the, responsibility, to, execute, or, implement, legislation, and, may, have, the, limited, legislative, powers, such, as, a, veto, however, a, legislative, branch, passes, legislation, and, budgets, this, provides, some, measure, of, separation, of, powers, in, consequence, however, the, president, and, the, legislature, may, end, up, in, the, control, of, separate, parties, allowing, one, to, block, the, other, and, thereby, interfere, with, the, orderly, operation, of, the, state, this, may, be, the, reason, why, presidential, democracy, is, not, very, common, outside, the, americas, africa, and, central, and, southeast, asia, a, semi, presidential, system, is, a, system, of, democracy, in, which, the, government, includes, both, a, prime, minister, and, a, president, the, particular, powers, held, by, the, prime, minister, and, president, vary, by, country, many, countries, such, as, the, united, kingdom, spain, the, netherlands, belgium, scandinavian, countries, thailand, japan, and, bhutan, turned, powerful, monarchs, into, constitutional, monarchs, often, gradually, with, limited, or, symbolic, roles, for, example, in, the, predecessor, states, to, the, united, kingdom, constitutional, monarchy, began, to, emerge, and, has, continued, uninterrupted, since, the, glorious, revolution, of, 1688, and, passage, of, the, bill, of, rights, 1689, strongly, limited, constitutional, monarchies, such, as, the, united, kingdom, have, been, referred, to, as, crowned, republics, by, writers, such, as, h, g, wells, in, other, countries, the, monarchy, was, abolished, along, with, the, aristocratic, system, as, in, france, china, russia, germany, austria, hungary, italy, greece, and, egypt, an, elected, person, with, or, without, significant, powers, became, the, head, of, state, in, these, countries, elite, upper, houses, of, legislatures, which, often, had, lifetime, or, hereditary, tenure, were, common, in, many, states, over, time, these, either, had, their, powers, limited, as, with, the, british, house, of, lords, or, else, became, elective, and, remained, powerful, as, with, the, australian, senate, the, term, republic, has, many, different, meanings, but, today, often, refers, to, a, representative, democracy, with, an, elected, head, of, state, such, as, a, president, serving, for, a, limited, term, in, contrast, to, states, with, a, hereditary, monarch, as, a, head, of, state, even, if, these, states, also, are, representative, democracies, with, an, elected, or, appointed, head, of, government, such, as, a, prime, minister, the, founding, fathers, of, the, united, states, often, criticised, direct, democracy, which, in, their, view, often, came, without, the, protection, of, a, constitution, enshrining, inalienable, rights, james, madison, argued, especially, in, the, federalist, no, 10, that, what, distinguished, a, direct, democracy, from, a, republic, was, that, the, former, became, weaker, as, it, got, larger, and, suffered, more, violently, from, the, effects, of, faction, whereas, a, republic, could, get, stronger, as, it, got, larger, and, combats, faction, by, its, very, structure, professors, richard, ellis, of, willamette, university, and, michael, nelson, of, rhodes, college, argue, that, much, constitutional, thought, from, madison, to, lincoln, and, beyond, has, focused, on, the, problem, of, majority, tyranny, they, conclude, the, principles, of, republican, government, embedded, in, the, constitution, represent, an, effort, by, the, framers, to, ensure, that, the, inalienable, rights, of, life, liberty, and, the, pursuit, of, happiness, would, not, be, trampled, by, majorities, what, was, critical, to, american, values, john, adams, insisted, was, that, the, government, be, bound, by, fixed, laws, which, the, people, have, a, voice, in, making, and, a, right, to, defend, as, benjamin, franklin, was, exiting, after, writing, the, us, constitution, elizabeth, willing, powel, asked, him, well, doctor, what, have, we, got, a, republic, or, a, monarchy, he, replied, a, republic, if, you, can, keep, it, a, liberal, democracy, is, a, representative, democracy, in, which, the, ability, of, the, elected, representatives, to, exercise, decision, making, power, is, subject, to, the, rule, of, law, and, moderated, by, a, constitution, or, laws, that, emphasise, the, protection, of, the, rights, and, freedoms, of, individuals, and, which, places, constraints, on, the, leaders, and, on, the, extent, to, which, the, will, of, the, majority, can, be, exercised, against, the, rights, of, minorities, see, civil, liberties, in, a, liberal, democracy, it, is, possible, for, some, large, scale, decisions, to, emerge, from, the, many, individual, decisions, that, citizens, are, free, to, make, in, other, words, citizens, can, vote, with, their, feet, or, vote, with, their, dollars, resulting, in, significant, informal, government, by, the, masses, that, exercises, many, powers, associated, with, formal, government, elsewhere, socialist, thought, has, several, different, views, on, democracy, social, democracy, democratic, socialism, and, the, dictatorship, of, the, proletariat, are, some, examples, many, democratic, socialists, and, social, democrats, believe, in, a, form, of, participatory, industrial, economic, and, or, workplace, democracy, combined, with, a, representative, democracy, trotskyist, groups, have, interpreted, socialist, democracy, to, be, synonymous, with, multi, party, socialist, representation, autonomous, union, organizations, worker, s, control, of, production, internal, party, democracy, and, the, mass, participation, of, the, working, masses, within, marxist, orthodoxy, there, is, a, hostility, to, what, is, commonly, called, liberal, democracy, which, is, referred, to, as, parliamentary, democracy, because, of, its, centralised, nature, because, of, orthodox, marxists, desire, to, eliminate, the, political, elitism, they, see, in, capitalism, marxists, leninists, and, trotskyists, believe, in, direct, democracy, implemented, through, a, system, of, communes, which, are, sometimes, called, soviets, this, system, can, begin, with, workplace, democracy, and, ultimately, manifests, itself, as, council, democracy, anarchists, are, split, in, this, domain, depending, on, whether, they, believe, that, a, majority, rule, is, tyrannic, or, not, to, many, anarchists, the, only, form, of, democracy, considered, acceptable, is, direct, democracy, pierre, joseph, proudhon, argued, that, the, only, acceptable, form, of, direct, democracy, is, one, in, which, it, is, recognised, that, majority, decisions, are, not, binding, on, the, minority, even, when, unanimous, however, anarcho, communist, murray, bookchin, criticised, individualist, anarchists, for, opposing, democracy, and, says, majority, rule, is, consistent, with, anarchism, some, anarcho, communists, oppose, the, majoritarian, nature, of, direct, democracy, feeling, that, it, can, impede, individual, liberty, and, opt, in, favour, of, a, non, majoritarian, form, of, consensus, democracy, similar, to, proudhon, s, position, on, direct, democracy, sortition, is, the, process, of, choosing, decision, making, bodies, via, a, random, selection, these, bodies, can, be, more, representative, of, the, opinions, and, interests, of, the, people, at, large, than, an, elected, legislature, or, other, decision, maker, the, technique, was, in, widespread, use, in, athenian, democracy, and, renaissance, florence, and, is, still, used, in, modern, jury, selection, and, citizens, assemblies, consociational, democracy, also, called, consociationalism, is, a, form, of, democracy, based, on, power, sharing, formula, between, elites, representing, the, social, groups, within, the, society, in, 1969, arendt, lijphart, argued, this, would, stabilize, democracies, with, factions, a, consociational, democracy, allows, for, simultaneous, majority, votes, in, two, or, more, ethno, religious, constituencies, and, policies, are, enacted, only, if, they, gain, majority, support, from, both, or, all, of, them, the, qualified, majority, voting, rule, in, european, council, of, ministers, is, a, consociational, democracy, approach, for, supranational, democracies, this, system, in, treaty, of, rome, allocates, votes, to, member, states, in, part, according, to, their, population, but, heavily, weighted, in, favour, of, the, smaller, states, a, consociational, democracy, requires, consensus, of, representatives, while, consensus, democracy, requires, consensus, of, electorate, consensus, democracy, requires, consensus, decision, making, and, supermajority, to, obtain, a, larger, support, than, majority, in, contrast, in, majoritarian, democracy, minority, opinions, can, potentially, be, ignored, by, vote, winning, majorities, constitutions, typically, require, consensus, or, supermajorities, inclusive, democracy, is, a, political, theory, and, political, project, that, aims, for, direct, democracy, in, all, fields, of, social, life, political, democracy, in, the, form, of, face, to, face, assemblies, which, are, confederated, economic, democracy, in, a, stateless, moneyless, and, marketless, economy, democracy, in, the, social, realm, i, e, self, management, in, places, of, work, and, education, and, ecological, democracy, which, aims, to, reintegrate, society, and, nature, the, theoretical, project, of, inclusive, democracy, emerged, from, the, work, of, political, philosopher, takis, fotopoulos, in, towards, an, inclusive, democracy, and, was, further, developed, in, the, journal, democracy, nature, and, its, successor, the, international, journal, of, inclusive, democracy, a, parpolity, or, participatory, polity, is, a, theoretical, form, of, democracy, that, is, ruled, by, a, nested, council, structure, the, guiding, philosophy, is, that, people, should, have, decision, making, power, in, proportion, to, how, much, they, are, affected, by, the, decision, local, councils, of, 25, 50, people, are, completely, autonomous, on, issues, that, affect, only, them, and, these, councils, send, delegates, to, higher, level, councils, who, are, again, autonomous, regarding, issues, that, affect, only, the, population, affected, by, that, council, a, council, court, of, randomly, chosen, citizens, serves, as, a, check, on, the, tyranny, of, the, majority, and, rules, on, which, body, gets, to, vote, on, which, issue, delegates, may, vote, differently, from, how, their, sending, council, might, wish, but, are, mandated, to, communicate, the, wishes, of, their, sending, council, delegates, are, recallable, at, any, time, referendums, are, possible, at, any, time, via, votes, of, lower, level, councils, however, not, everything, is, a, referendum, as, this, is, most, likely, a, waste, of, time, a, parpolity, is, meant, to, work, in, tandem, with, a, participatory, economy, cosmopolitan, democracy, also, known, as, global, democracy, or, world, federalism, is, a, political, system, in, which, democracy, is, implemented, on, a, global, scale, either, directly, or, through, representatives, an, important, justification, for, this, kind, of, system, is, that, the, decisions, made, in, national, or, regional, democracies, often, affect, people, outside, the, constituency, who, by, definition, cannot, vote, by, contrast, in, a, cosmopolitan, democracy, the, people, who, are, affected, by, decisions, also, have, a, say, in, them, according, to, its, supporters, any, attempt, to, solve, global, problems, is, undemocratic, without, some, form, of, cosmopolitan, democracy, the, general, principle, of, cosmopolitan, democracy, is, to, expand, some, or, all, of, the, values, and, norms, of, democracy, including, the, rule, of, law, the, non, violent, resolution, of, conflicts, and, equality, among, citizens, beyond, the, limits, of, the, state, to, be, fully, implemented, this, would, require, reforming, existing, international, organisations, e, g, the, united, nations, as, well, as, the, creation, of, new, institutions, such, as, a, world, parliament, which, ideally, would, enhance, public, control, over, and, accountability, in, international, politics, cosmopolitan, democracy, has, been, promoted, among, others, by, physicist, albert, einstein, writer, kurt, vonnegut, columnist, george, monbiot, and, professors, david, held, and, daniele, archibugi, the, creation, of, the, international, criminal, court, in, 2003, was, seen, as, a, major, step, forward, by, many, supporters, of, this, type, of, cosmopolitan, democracy, creative, democracy, is, advocated, by, american, philosopher, john, dewey, the, main, idea, about, creative, democracy, is, that, democracy, encourages, individual, capacity, building, and, the, interaction, among, the, society, dewey, argues, that, democracy, is, a, way, of, life, in, his, work, of, creative, democracy, the, task, before, us, and, an, experience, built, on, faith, in, human, nature, faith, in, human, beings, and, faith, in, working, with, others, democracy, in, dewey, s, view, is, a, moral, ideal, requiring, actual, effort, and, work, by, people, it, is, not, an, institutional, concept, that, exists, outside, of, ourselves, the, task, of, democracy, dewey, concludes, is, forever, that, of, creation, of, a, freer, and, more, humane, experience, in, which, all, share, and, to, which, all, contribute, guided, democracy, is, a, form, of, democracy, that, incorporates, regular, popular, elections, but, which, often, carefully, guides, the, choices, offered, to, the, electorate, in, a, manner, that, may, reduce, the, ability, of, the, electorate, to, truly, determine, the, type, of, government, exercised, over, them, such, democracies, typically, have, only, one, central, authority, which, is, often, not, subject, to, meaningful, public, review, by, any, other, governmental, authority, russian, style, democracy, has, often, been, referred, to, as, a, guided, democracy, russian, politicians, have, referred, to, their, government, as, having, only, one, center, of, power, authority, as, opposed, to, most, other, forms, of, democracy, which, usually, attempt, to, incorporate, two, or, more, naturally, competing, sources, of, authority, within, the, same, government, aside, from, the, public, sphere, similar, democratic, principles, and, mechanisms, of, voting, and, representation, have, been, used, to, govern, other, kinds, of, groups, many, non, governmental, organisations, decide, policy, and, leadership, by, voting, most, trade, unions, and, cooperatives, are, governed, by, democratic, elections, corporations, are, ultimately, governed, by, their, shareholders, through, shareholder, democracy, corporations, may, also, employ, systems, such, as, workplace, democracy, to, handle, internal, governance, amitai, etzioni, has, postulated, a, system, that, fuses, elements, of, democracy, with, sharia, law, termed, islamocracy, there, is, also, a, growing, number, of, democratic, educational, institutions, such, as, sudbury, schools, that, are, co, governed, by, students, and, staff, shareholder, democracy, is, a, concept, relating, to, the, governance, of, corporations, by, their, shareholders, in, the, united, states, shareholders, are, typically, granted, voting, rights, according, to, the, one, share, one, vote, principle, shareholders, may, vote, annually, to, elect, the, company, s, board, of, directors, who, themselves, may, choose, the, company, s, executives, the, shareholder, democracy, framework, may, be, inaccurate, for, companies, which, have, different, classes, of, stock, that, further, alter, the, distribution, of, voting, rights, several, justifications, for, democracy, have, been, postulated, social, contract, theory, argues, that, the, legitimacy, of, government, is, based, on, consent, of, the, governed, i, e, an, election, and, that, political, decisions, must, reflect, the, general, will, some, proponents, of, the, theory, like, jean, jacques, rousseau, advocate, for, a, direct, democracy, on, this, basis, condorcet, s, jury, theorem, is, logical, proof, that, if, each, decision, maker, has, a, better, than, chance, probability, of, making, the, right, decision, then, having, the, largest, number, of, decision, makers, i, e, a, democracy, will, result, in, the, best, decisions, this, has, also, been, argued, by, theories, of, the, wisdom, of, the, crowd, democracy, tends, to, improve, conflict, resolution, in, why, nations, fail, economists, daron, acemoglu, and, james, a, robinson, argue, that, democracies, are, more, economically, successful, because, undemocratic, political, systems, tend, to, limit, markets, and, favor, monopolies, at, the, expense, of, the, creative, destruction, which, is, necessary, for, sustained, economic, growth, a, 2019, study, by, acemoglu, and, others, estimated, that, countries, switching, to, democratic, from, authoritarian, rule, had, on, average, a, 20, higher, gdp, after, 25, years, than, if, they, had, remained, authoritarian, the, study, examined, 122, transitions, to, democracy, and, 71, transitions, to, authoritarian, rule, occurring, from, 1960, to, 2010, acemoglu, said, this, was, because, democracies, tended, to, invest, more, in, health, care, and, human, capital, and, reduce, special, treatment, of, regime, allies, a, 2023, study, analyzed, the, long, term, effects, of, democracy, on, economic, prosperity, using, new, data, on, gdp, per, capita, and, democracy, for, a, dataset, between, 1789, and, 2019, the, results, indicate, that, democracy, substantially, increases, economic, development, democracy, promotion, also, referred, to, as, democracy, building, can, be, domestic, policy, to, increase, the, quality, of, already, existing, democracy, or, a, strand, of, foreign, policy, adopted, by, governments, and, international, organizations, that, seek, to, support, the, spread, of, democracy, as, a, system, of, government, in, practice, it, entails, consolidating, and, building, democratic, institutions, democracy, promotion, can, increase, the, quality, of, already, existing, democracies, reduce, political, apathy, and, the, chance, of, democratic, backsliding, democracy, promotion, measures, include, voting, advice, applications, participatory, democracy, increasing, youth, suffrage, increasing, civic, education, reducing, barriers, to, entry, for, new, political, parties, increasing, proportionality, and, reducing, presidentialism, a, democratic, transition, describes, a, phase, in, a, countries, political, system, often, created, as, a, result, of, an, incomplete, change, from, an, authoritarian, regime, to, a, democratic, one, or, vice, versa, several, philosophers, and, researchers, have, outlined, historical, and, social, factors, seen, as, supporting, the, evolution, of, democracy, other, commentators, have, mentioned, the, influence, of, economic, development, in, a, related, theory, ronald, inglehart, suggests, that, improved, living, standards, in, modern, developed, countries, can, convince, people, that, they, can, take, their, basic, survival, for, granted, leading, to, increased, emphasis, on, self, expression, values, which, correlates, closely, with, democracy, douglas, m, gibler, and, andrew, owsiak, in, their, study, argued, about, the, importance, of, peace, and, stable, borders, for, the, development, of, democracy, it, has, often, been, assumed, that, democracy, causes, peace, but, this, study, shows, that, historically, peace, has, almost, always, predated, the, establishment, of, democracy, carroll, quigley, concludes, that, the, characteristics, of, weapons, are, the, main, predictor, of, democracy, democracy, this, scenario, tends, to, emerge, only, when, the, best, weapons, available, are, easy, for, individuals, to, obtain, and, use, by, the, 1800s, guns, were, the, best, personal, weapons, available, and, in, the, united, states, of, america, already, nominally, democratic, almost, everyone, could, afford, to, buy, a, gun, and, could, learn, how, to, use, it, fairly, easily, governments, could, not, do, any, better, it, became, the, age, of, mass, armies, of, citizen, soldiers, with, guns, similarly, periclean, greece, was, an, age, of, the, citizen, soldier, and, democracy, other, theories, stressed, the, relevance, of, education, and, of, human, capital, and, within, them, of, cognitive, ability, to, increasing, tolerance, rationality, political, literacy, and, participation, two, effects, of, education, and, cognitive, ability, are, distinguished, evidence, consistent, with, conventional, theories, of, why, democracy, emerges, and, is, sustained, has, been, hard, to, come, by, statistical, analyses, have, challenged, modernisation, theory, by, demonstrating, that, there, is, no, reliable, evidence, for, the, claim, that, democracy, is, more, likely, to, emerge, when, countries, become, wealthier, more, educated, or, less, unequal, in, fact, empirical, evidence, shows, that, economic, growth, and, education, may, not, lead, to, increased, demand, for, democratization, as, modernization, theory, suggests, historically, most, countries, attained, high, levels, of, access, to, primary, education, well, before, transitioning, to, democracy, rather, than, acting, as, a, catalyst, for, democratization, in, some, situations, education, provision, may, instead, be, used, by, non, democratic, regimes, to, indoctrinate, their, subjects, and, strengthen, their, power, the, assumed, link, between, education, and, economic, growth, is, called, into, question, when, analyzing, empirical, evidence, across, different, countries, the, correlation, between, education, attainment, and, math, test, scores, is, very, weak, 07, a, similarly, weak, relationship, exists, between, per, pupil, expenditures, and, math, competency, 26, additionally, historical, evidence, suggests, that, average, human, capital, measured, using, literacy, rates, of, the, masses, does, not, explain, the, onset, of, industrialization, in, france, from, 1750, to, 1850, despite, arguments, to, the, contrary, together, these, findings, show, that, education, does, not, always, promote, human, capital, and, economic, growth, as, is, generally, argued, to, be, the, case, instead, the, evidence, implies, that, education, provision, often, falls, short, of, its, expressed, goals, or, alternatively, that, political, actors, use, education, to, promote, goals, other, than, economic, growth, and, development, some, scholars, have, searched, for, the, deep, determinants, of, contemporary, political, institutions, be, they, geographical, or, demographic, an, example, of, this, is, the, disease, environment, places, with, different, mortality, rates, had, different, populations, and, productivity, levels, around, the, world, for, example, in, africa, the, tsetse, fly, which, afflicts, humans, and, livestock, reduced, the, ability, of, africans, to, plough, the, land, this, made, africa, less, settled, as, a, consequence, political, power, was, less, concentrated, this, also, affected, the, colonial, institutions, european, countries, established, in, africa, whether, colonial, settlers, could, live, or, not, in, a, place, made, them, develop, different, institutions, which, led, to, different, economic, and, social, paths, this, also, affected, the, distribution, of, power, and, the, collective, actions, people, could, take, as, a, result, some, african, countries, ended, up, having, democracies, and, others, autocracies, an, example, of, geographical, determinants, for, democracy, is, having, access, to, coastal, areas, and, rivers, this, natural, endowment, has, a, positive, relation, with, economic, development, thanks, to, the, benefits, of, trade, trade, brought, economic, development, which, in, turn, broadened, power, rulers, wanting, to, increase, revenues, had, to, protect, property, rights, to, create, incentives, for, people, to, invest, as, more, people, had, more, power, more, concessions, had, to, be, made, by, the, ruler, and, in, many, places, this, process, lead, to, democracy, these, determinants, defined, the, structure, of, the, society, moving, the, balance, of, political, power, robert, michels, asserts, that, although, democracy, can, never, be, fully, realised, democracy, may, be, developed, automatically, in, the, act, of, striving, for, democracy, the, peasant, in, the, fable, when, on, his, deathbed, tells, his, sons, that, a, treasure, is, buried, in, the, field, after, the, old, man, s, death, the, sons, dig, everywhere, in, order, to, discover, the, treasure, they, do, not, find, it, but, their, indefatigable, labor, improves, the, soil, and, secures, for, them, a, comparative, well, being, the, treasure, in, the, fable, may, well, symbolise, democracy, democracy, in, modern, times, has, almost, always, faced, opposition, from, the, previously, existing, government, and, many, times, it, has, faced, opposition, from, social, elites, the, implementation, of, a, democratic, government, from, a, non, democratic, state, is, typically, brought, by, peaceful, or, violent, democratic, revolution, some, democratic, governments, have, experienced, sudden, state, collapse, and, regime, change, to, an, undemocratic, form, of, government, domestic, military, coups, or, rebellions, are, the, most, common, means, by, which, democratic, governments, have, been, overthrown, see, list, of, coups, and, coup, attempts, by, country, and, list, of, civil, wars, examples, include, the, spanish, civil, war, the, coup, of, 18, brumaire, that, ended, the, first, french, republic, and, the, 28, may, 1926, coup, d, tat, which, ended, the, first, portuguese, republic, some, military, coups, are, supported, by, foreign, governments, such, as, the, 1954, guatemalan, coup, d, tat, and, the, 1953, iranian, coup, d, tat, other, types, of, a, sudden, end, to, democracy, include, democratic, backsliding, can, end, democracy, in, a, gradual, manner, by, increasing, emphasis, on, national, security, and, eroding, free, and, fair, elections, freedom, of, expression, independence, of, the, judiciary, rule, of, law, a, famous, example, is, the, enabling, act, of, 1933, which, lawfully, ended, democracy, in, weimar, germany, and, marked, the, transition, to, nazi, germany, temporary, or, long, term, political, violence, and, government, interference, can, prevent, free, and, fair, elections, which, erode, the, democratic, nature, of, governments, this, has, happened, on, a, local, level, even, in, well, established, democracies, like, the, united, states, for, example, the, wilmington, insurrection, of, 1898, and, african, american, disfranchisement, after, the, reconstruction, era, criticism, of, democracy, or, debate, on, democracy, and, the, different, aspects, of, how, to, implement, democracy, best, have, been, widely, discussed, there, are, both, internal, critics, those, who, call, upon, the, constitutional, regime, to, be, true, to, its, own, highest, principles, and, external, ones, who, reject, the, values, promoted, by, constitutional, democracy, criticism, of, democracy, has, been, a, key, part, of, democracy, its, functions, and, its, development, throughout, history, plato, famously, opposed, democracy, arguing, for, a, government, of, the, best, qualified, james, madison, extensively, studied, the, historic, attempts, at, and, arguments, on, democracy, in, his, preparation, for, the, constitutional, convention, and, winston, churchill, remarked, that, no, one, pretends, that, democracy, is, perfect, or, all, wise, indeed, it, has, been, said, that, democracy, is, the, worst, form, of, government, except, all, those, other, forms, that, have, been, tried, from, time, to, time, the, theory, of, democracy, relies, on, the, implicit, assumption, that, voters, are, well, informed, about, social, issues, policies, and, candidates, so, that, they, can, make, a, truly, informed, decision, since, the, late, 20, th, century, there, has, been, a, growing, concern, that, voters, may, be, poorly, informed, because, the, news, media, are, focusing, more, on, entertainment, and, gossip, and, less, on, serious, journalistic, research, on, political, issues, the, media, professors, michael, gurevitch, and, jay, blumler, have, proposed, a, number, of, functions, that, the, mass, media, are, expected, to, fulfill, in, a, democracy, this, proposal, has, inspired, a, lot, of, discussions, over, whether, the, news, media, are, actually, fulfilling, the, requirements, that, a, well, functioning, democracy, requires, commercial, mass, media, are, generally, not, accountable, to, anybody, but, their, owners, and, they, have, no, obligation, to, serve, a, democratic, function, they, are, controlled, mainly, by, economic, market, forces, fierce, economic, competition, may, force, the, mass, media, to, divert, themselves, from, any, democratic, ideals, and, focus, entirely, on, how, to, survive, the, competition, the, tabloidization, and, popularization, of, the, news, media, is, seen, in, an, increasing, focus, on, human, examples, rather, than, statistics, and, principles, there, is, more, focus, on, politicians, as, personalities, and, less, focus, on, political, issues, in, the, popular, media, election, campaigns, are, covered, more, as, horse, races, and, less, as, debates, about, ideologies, and, issues, the, dominating, media, focus, on, spin, conflict, and, competitive, strategies, has, made, voters, perceive, the, politicians, as, egoists, rather, than, idealists, this, fosters, mistrust, and, a, cynical, attitude, to, politics, less, civic, engagement, and, less, interest, in, voting, the, ability, to, find, effective, political, solutions, to, social, problems, is, hampered, when, problems, tend, to, be, blamed, on, individuals, rather, than, on, structural, causes, this, person, centered, focus, may, have, far, reaching, consequences, not, only, for, domestic, problems, but, also, for, foreign, policy, when, international, conflicts, are, blamed, on, foreign, heads, of, state, rather, than, on, political, and, economic, structures, a, strong, media, focus, on, fear, and, terrorism, has, allowed, military, logic, to, penetrate, public, institutions, leading, to, increased, surveillance, and, the, erosion, of, civil, rights, the, responsiveness, and, accountability, of, the, democratic, system, is, compromised, when, lack, of, access, to, substantive, diverse, and, undistorted, information, is, handicapping, the, citizens, capability, of, evaluating, the, political, process, the, fast, pace, and, trivialization, in, the, competitive, news, media, is, dumbing, down, the, political, debate, thorough, and, balanced, investigation, of, complex, political, issues, does, not, fit, into, this, format, the, political, communication, is, characterized, by, short, time, horizons, short, slogans, simple, explanations, and, simple, solutions, this, is, conducive, to, political, populism, rather, than, serious, deliberation, commercial, mass, media, are, often, differentiated, along, the, political, spectrum, so, that, people, can, hear, mainly, opinions, that, they, already, agree, with, too, much, controversy, and, diverse, opinions, are, not, always, profitable, for, the, commercial, news, media, political, polarization, is, emerging, when, different, people, read, different, news, and, watch, different, tv, channels, this, polarization, has, been, worsened, by, the, emergence, of, the, social, media, that, allow, people, to, communicate, mainly, with, groups, of, like, minded, people, the, so, called, echo, chambers, extreme, political, polarization, may, undermine, the, trust, in, democratic, institutions, leading, to, erosion, of, civil, rights, and, free, speech, and, in, some, cases, even, reversion, to, autocracy, many, media, scholars, have, discussed, non, commercial, news, media, with, public, service, obligations, as, a, means, to, improve, the, democratic, process, by, providing, the, kind, of, political, contents, that, a, free, market, does, not, provide, the, world, bank, has, recommended, public, service, broadcasting, in, order, to, strengthen, democracy, in, developing, countries, these, broadcasting, services, should, be, accountable, to, an, independent, regulatory, body, that, is, adequately, protected, from, interference, from, political, and, economic, interests, public, service, media, have, an, obligation, to, provide, reliable, information, to, voters, many, countries, have, publicly, funded, radio, and, television, stations, with, public, service, obligations, especially, in, europe, and, japan, while, such, media, are, weak, or, non, existent, in, other, countries, including, the, us, several, studies, have, shown, that, the, stronger, the, dominance, of, commercial, broadcast, media, over, public, service, media, the, less, the, amount, of, policy, relevant, information, in, the, media, and, the, more, focus, on, horse, race, journalism, personalities, and, the, pecadillos, of, politicians, public, service, broadcasters, are, characterized, by, more, policy, relevant, information, and, more, respect, for, journalistic, norms, and, impartiality, than, the, commercial, media, however, the, trend, of, deregulation, has, put, the, public, service, model, under, increased, pressure, from, competition, with, commercial, media, the, emergence, of, the, internet, and, the, social, media, has, profoundly, altered, the, conditions, for, political, communication, the, social, media, have, given, ordinary, citizens, easy, access, to, voice, their, opinion, and, share, information, while, bypassing, the, filters, of, the, large, news, media, this, is, often, seen, as, an, advantage, for, democracy, the, new, possibilities, for, communication, have, fundamentally, changed, the, way, social, movements, and, protest, movements, operate, and, organize, the, internet, and, social, media, have, provided, powerful, new, tools, for, democracy, movements, in, developing, countries, and, emerging, democracies, enabling, them, to, bypass, censorship, voice, their, opinions, and, organize, protests, a, serious, problem, with, the, social, media, is, that, they, have, no, truth, filters, the, established, news, media, have, to, guard, their, reputation, as, trustworthy, while, ordinary, citizens, may, post, unreliable, information, in, fact, studies, show, that, false, stories, are, going, more, viral, than, true, stories, the, proliferation, of, false, stories, and, conspiracy, theories, may, undermine, public, trust, in, the, political, system, and, public, officials, reliable, information, sources, are, essential, for, the, democratic, process, less, democratic, governments, rely, heavily, on, censorship, propaganda, and, misinformation, in, order, to, stay, in, power, while, independent, sources, of, information, are, able, to, undermine, their, legitimacy
