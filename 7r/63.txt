construction, is, a, general, term, meaning, the, art, and, science, of, forming, objects, systems, or, organizations, it, comes, from, the, latin, word, constructio, from, com, together, and, struere, to, pile, up, and, old, french, construction, to, construct, is, a, verb, the, act, of, building, and, the, noun, is, construction, how, something, is, built, or, the, nature, of, its, structure, in, its, most, widely, used, context, construction, covers, the, processes, involved, in, delivering, buildings, infrastructure, industrial, facilities, and, associated, activities, through, to, the, end, of, their, life, it, typically, starts, with, planning, financing, and, design, that, continues, until, the, asset, is, built, and, ready, for, use, construction, also, covers, repairs, and, maintenance, work, any, works, to, expand, extend, and, improve, the, asset, and, its, eventual, demolition, dismantling, or, decommissioning, the, construction, industry, contributes, significantly, to, many, countries, gross, domestic, products, gdp, global, expenditure, on, construction, activities, was, about, 4, trillion, in, 2012, in, 2022, expenditure, on, the, construction, industry, exceeded, 11, trillion, a, year, equivalent, to, about, 13, percent, of, global, gdp, this, spending, was, forecasted, to, rise, to, around, 14, 8, trillion, in, 2030, the, construction, industry, promotes, economic, development, and, brings, many, non, monetary, benefits, to, many, countries, but, it, is, one, of, the, most, hazardous, industries, for, example, about, 20, 1, 061, of, us, industry, fatalities, in, 2019, happened, in, construction, the, first, huts, and, shelters, were, constructed, by, hand, or, with, simple, tools, as, cities, grew, during, the, bronze, age, a, class, of, professional, craftsmen, like, bricklayers, and, carpenters, appeared, occasionally, slaves, were, used, for, construction, work, in, the, middle, ages, the, artisan, craftsmen, were, organized, into, guilds, in, the, 19th, century, steam, powered, machinery, appeared, and, later, diesel, and, electric, powered, vehicles, such, as, cranes, excavators, and, bulldozers, fast, track, construction, has, been, increasingly, popular, in, the, 21st, century, some, estimates, suggest, that, 40, of, construction, projects, are, now, fast, track, construction, broadly, there, are, three, sectors, of, construction, buildings, infrastructure, and, industrial, the, industry, can, also, be, classified, into, sectors, or, markets, for, example, engineering, news, record, enr, a, us, based, construction, trade, magazine, has, compiled, and, reported, data, about, the, size, of, design, and, construction, contractors, in, 2014, it, split, the, data, into, nine, market, segments, transportation, petroleum, buildings, power, industrial, water, manufacturing, sewage, waste, telecom, hazardous, waste, and, a, tenth, category, for, other, projects, enr, used, data, on, transportation, sewage, hazardous, waste, and, water, to, rank, firms, as, heavy, contractors, the, standard, industrial, classification, and, the, newer, north, american, industry, classification, system, classify, companies, that, perform, or, engage, in, construction, into, three, subsectors, building, construction, heavy, and, civil, engineering, construction, and, specialty, trade, contractors, there, are, also, categories, for, professional, services, firms, e, g, engineering, architecture, surveying, project, management, building, construction, is, the, process, of, adding, structures, to, areas, of, land, also, known, as, real, property, sites, typically, a, project, is, instigated, by, or, with, the, owner, of, the, property, who, may, be, an, individual, or, an, organisation, occasionally, land, may, be, compulsorily, purchased, from, the, owner, for, public, use, residential, construction, may, be, undertaken, by, individual, land, owners, self, built, by, specialist, housebuilders, by, property, developers, by, general, contractors, or, by, providers, of, public, or, social, housing, e, g, local, authorities, housing, associations, where, local, zoning, or, planning, policies, allow, mixed, use, developments, may, comprise, both, residential, and, non, residential, construction, e, g, retail, leisure, offices, public, buildings, etc, residential, construction, practices, technologies, and, resources, must, conform, to, local, building, authority, s, regulations, and, codes, of, practice, materials, readily, available, in, the, area, generally, dictate, the, construction, materials, used, e, g, brick, versus, stone, versus, timber, costs, of, construction, on, a, per, square, meter, or, per, square, foot, basis, for, houses, can, vary, dramatically, based, on, site, conditions, access, routes, local, regulations, economies, of, scale, custom, designed, homes, are, often, more, expensive, to, build, and, the, availability, of, skilled, tradespeople, depending, upon, the, type, of, building, non, residential, building, construction, can, be, procured, by, a, wide, range, of, private, and, public, organisations, including, local, authorities, educational, and, religious, bodies, transport, undertakings, retailers, hoteliers, property, developers, financial, institutions, and, other, private, companies, most, construction, in, these, sectors, is, undertaken, by, general, contractors, civil, engineering, covers, the, design, construction, and, maintenance, of, the, physical, and, naturally, built, environment, including, public, works, such, as, roads, bridges, canals, dams, tunnels, airports, water, and, sewerage, systems, pipelines, and, railways, some, general, contractors, have, expertise, in, civil, engineering, civil, engineering, contractors, are, firms, dedicated, to, work, in, this, sector, and, may, specialise, in, particular, types, of, infrastructure, industrial, construction, includes, offshore, construction, mainly, of, energy, installations, oil, and, gas, platforms, wind, power, mining, and, quarrying, refineries, breweries, distilleries, and, other, processing, plants, power, stations, steel, mills, warehouses, and, factories, some, construction, projects, are, small, renovations, or, repair, jobs, like, repainting, or, fixing, leaks, where, the, owner, may, act, as, designer, paymaster, and, laborer, for, the, entire, project, however, more, complex, or, ambitious, projects, usually, require, additional, multi, disciplinary, expertise, and, manpower, so, the, owner, may, commission, one, or, more, specialist, businesses, to, undertake, detailed, planning, design, construction, and, handover, of, the, work, often, the, owner, will, appoint, one, business, to, oversee, the, project, this, may, be, a, designer, a, contractor, a, construction, manager, or, other, advisors, such, specialists, are, normally, appointed, for, their, expertise, in, project, delivery, and, construction, management, and, will, help, the, owner, define, the, project, brief, agree, on, a, budget, and, schedule, liaise, with, relevant, public, authorities, and, procure, materials, and, the, services, of, other, specialists, the, supply, chain, comprising, subcontractors, and, materials, suppliers, contracts, are, agreed, for, the, delivery, of, services, by, all, businesses, alongside, other, detailed, plans, aimed, at, ensuring, legal, timely, on, budget, and, safe, delivery, of, the, specified, works, design, finance, and, legal, aspects, overlap, and, interrelate, the, design, must, be, not, only, structurally, sound, and, appropriate, for, the, use, and, location, but, must, also, be, financially, possible, to, build, and, legal, to, use, the, financial, structure, must, be, adequate, to, build, the, design, provided, and, must, pay, amounts, that, are, legally, owed, legal, structures, integrate, design, with, other, activities, and, enforce, financial, and, other, construction, processes, these, processes, also, affect, procurement, strategies, clients, may, for, example, appoint, a, business, to, design, the, project, after, which, a, competitive, process, is, undertaken, to, appoint, a, lead, contractor, to, construct, the, asset, design, bid, build, they, may, appoint, a, business, to, lead, both, design, and, construction, design, build, or, they, may, directly, appoint, a, designer, contractor, and, specialist, subcontractors, construction, management, some, forms, of, procurement, emphasize, collaborative, relationships, partnering, alliancing, between, the, client, the, contractor, and, other, stakeholders, within, a, construction, project, seeking, to, ameliorate, often, highly, competitive, and, adversarial, industry, practices, dfma, design, for, manufacture, and, assembly, approaches, also, emphasize, early, collaboration, with, manufacturers, and, suppliers, regarding, products, and, components, construction, or, refurbishment, work, in, a, live, environment, where, residents, or, businesses, remain, living, in, or, operating, on, the, site, requires, particular, care, planning, and, communication, when, applicable, a, proposed, construction, project, must, comply, with, local, land, use, planning, policies, including, zoning, and, building, code, requirements, a, project, will, normally, be, assessed, by, the, authority, having, jurisdiction, ahj, typically, the, municipality, where, the, project, will, be, located, for, its, potential, impacts, on, neighbouring, properties, and, upon, existing, infrastructure, transportation, social, infrastructure, and, utilities, including, water, supply, sewerage, electricity, telecommunications, etc, data, may, be, gathered, through, site, analysis, site, surveys, and, geotechnical, investigations, construction, normally, cannot, start, until, planning, permission, has, been, granted, and, may, require, preparatory, work, to, ensure, relevant, infrastructure, has, been, upgraded, before, building, work, can, commence, preparatory, works, will, also, include, surveys, of, existing, utility, lines, to, avoid, damage, causing, outages, and, other, hazardous, situations, some, legal, requirements, come, from, malum, in, se, considerations, or, the, desire, to, prevent, indisputably, bad, phenomena, e, g, explosions, or, bridge, collapses, other, legal, requirements, come, from, malum, prohibitum, considerations, or, factors, that, are, a, matter, of, custom, or, expectation, such, as, isolating, businesses, from, a, business, district, or, residences, from, a, residential, district, an, attorney, may, seek, changes, or, exemptions, in, the, law, that, governs, the, land, where, the, building, will, be, built, either, by, arguing, that, a, rule, is, inapplicable, the, bridge, design, will, not, cause, a, collapse, or, that, the, custom, is, no, longer, needed, acceptance, of, live, work, spaces, has, grown, in, the, community, during, the, construction, of, a, building, a, municipal, building, inspector, usually, inspects, the, ongoing, work, periodically, to, ensure, that, construction, adheres, to, the, approved, plans, and, the, local, building, code, once, construction, is, complete, any, later, changes, made, to, a, building, or, other, asset, that, affect, safety, including, its, use, expansion, structural, integrity, and, fire, protection, usually, require, municipality, approval, depending, on, the, type, of, project, mortgage, bankers, accountants, and, cost, engineers, may, participate, in, creating, an, overall, plan, for, the, financial, management, of, a, construction, project, the, presence, of, the, mortgage, banker, is, highly, likely, even, in, relatively, small, projects, since, the, owner, s, equity, in, the, property, is, the, most, obvious, source, of, funding, for, a, building, project, accountants, act, to, study, the, expected, monetary, flow, over, the, life, of, the, project, and, to, monitor, the, payouts, throughout, the, process, professionals, including, cost, engineers, estimators, and, quantity, surveyors, apply, expertise, to, relate, the, work, and, materials, involved, to, a, proper, valuation, financial, planning, ensures, adequate, safeguards, and, contingency, plans, are, in, place, before, the, project, is, started, and, ensures, that, the, plan, is, properly, executed, over, the, life, of, the, project, construction, projects, can, suffer, from, preventable, financial, problems, underbids, happen, when, builders, ask, for, too, little, money, to, complete, the, project, cash, flow, problems, exist, when, the, present, amount, of, funding, cannot, cover, the, current, costs, for, labour, and, materials, such, problems, may, arise, even, when, the, overall, budget, is, adequate, presenting, a, temporary, issue, cost, overruns, with, government, projects, have, occurred, when, the, contractor, identified, change, orders, or, project, changes, that, increased, costs, which, are, not, subject, to, competition, from, other, firms, as, they, have, already, been, eliminated, from, consideration, after, the, initial, bid, fraud, is, also, an, issue, of, growing, significance, within, construction, large, projects, can, involve, highly, complex, financial, plans, and, often, start, with, a, conceptual, cost, estimate, performed, by, a, building, estimator, as, portions, of, a, project, are, completed, they, may, be, sold, supplanting, one, lender, or, owner, for, another, while, the, logistical, requirements, of, having, the, right, trades, and, materials, available, for, each, stage, of, the, building, construction, project, carry, forward, public, private, partnerships, ppps, or, private, finance, initiatives, pfis, may, also, be, used, to, help, deliver, major, projects, according, to, mckinsey, in, 2019, the, vast, majority, of, large, construction, projects, go, over, budget, and, take, 20, longer, than, expected, a, construction, project, is, a, complex, net, of, construction, contracts, and, other, legal, obligations, each, of, which, all, parties, must, carefully, consider, a, contract, is, the, exchange, of, a, set, of, obligations, between, two, or, more, parties, and, provides, structures, to, manage, issues, for, example, construction, delays, can, be, costly, so, construction, contracts, set, out, clear, expectations, and, clear, paths, to, manage, delays, poorly, drafted, contracts, can, lead, to, confusion, and, costly, disputes, at, the, start, of, a, project, legal, advisors, seek, to, identify, ambiguities, and, other, potential, sources, of, trouble, in, the, contract, structures, and, to, present, options, for, preventing, problems, during, projects, they, work, to, avoid, and, resolve, conflicts, that, arise, in, each, case, the, lawyer, facilitates, an, exchange, of, obligations, that, matches, the, reality, of, the, project, design, bid, build, is, the, most, common, and, well, established, method, of, construction, procurement, in, this, arrangement, the, architect, engineer, or, builder, acts, for, the, client, as, the, project, coordinator, they, design, the, works, prepare, specifications, and, design, deliverables, models, drawings, etc, administer, the, contract, tender, the, works, and, manage, the, works, from, inception, to, completion, in, parallel, there, are, direct, contractual, links, between, the, client, and, the, main, contractor, who, in, turn, has, direct, contractual, relationships, with, subcontractors, the, arrangement, continues, until, the, project, is, ready, for, handover, design, build, became, more, common, from, the, late, 20th, century, and, involves, the, client, contracting, a, single, entity, to, provide, design, and, construction, in, some, cases, the, design, build, package, can, also, include, finding, the, site, arranging, funding, and, applying, for, all, necessary, statutory, consents, typically, the, client, invites, several, design, build, d, b, contractors, to, submit, proposals, to, meet, the, project, brief, and, then, selects, a, preferred, supplier, often, this, will, be, a, consortium, involving, a, design, firm, and, a, contractor, sometimes, more, than, one, of, each, in, the, united, states, departments, of, transportation, usually, use, design, build, contracts, as, a, way, of, progressing, projects, where, states, lack, the, skills, or, resources, particularly, for, very, large, projects, in, a, construction, management, arrangement, the, client, enters, into, separate, contracts, with, the, designer, architect, or, engineer, a, construction, manager, and, individual, trade, contractors, the, client, takes, on, the, contractual, role, while, the, construction, or, project, manager, provides, the, active, role, of, managing, the, separate, trade, contracts, and, ensuring, that, they, complete, all, work, smoothly, and, effectively, together, this, approach, is, often, used, to, speed, up, procurement, processes, to, allow, the, client, greater, flexibility, in, design, variation, throughout, the, contract, to, enable, the, appointment, of, individual, work, contractors, to, separate, contractual, responsibility, on, each, individual, throughout, the, contract, and, to, provide, greater, client, control, in, the, industrialized, world, construction, usually, involves, the, translation, of, designs, into, reality, most, commonly, i, e, in, a, design, bid, build, project, the, design, team, is, employed, by, i, e, in, contract, with, the, property, owner, depending, upon, the, type, of, project, a, design, team, may, include, architects, civil, engineers, mechanical, engineers, electrical, engineers, structural, engineers, fire, protection, engineers, planning, consultants, architectural, consultants, and, archaeological, consultants, a, lead, designer, will, normally, be, identified, to, help, coordinate, different, disciplinary, inputs, to, the, overall, design, this, may, be, aided, by, integration, of, previously, separate, disciplines, often, undertaken, by, separate, firms, into, multi, disciplinary, firms, with, experts, from, all, related, fields, or, by, firms, establishing, relationships, to, support, design, build, processes, the, increasing, complexity, of, construction, projects, creates, the, need, for, design, professionals, trained, in, all, phases, of, a, project, s, life, cycle, and, develop, an, appreciation, of, the, asset, as, an, advanced, technological, system, requiring, close, integration, of, many, sub, systems, and, their, individual, components, including, sustainability, for, buildings, building, engineering, is, an, emerging, discipline, that, attempts, to, meet, this, new, challenge, traditionally, design, has, involved, the, production, of, sketches, architectural, and, engineering, drawings, and, specifications, until, the, late, 20th, century, drawings, were, largely, hand, drafted, adoption, of, computer, aided, design, cad, technologies, then, improved, design, productivity, while, the, 21st, century, introduction, of, building, information, modeling, bim, processes, has, involved, the, use, of, computer, generated, models, that, can, be, used, in, their, own, right, or, to, generate, drawings, and, other, visualisations, as, well, as, capturing, non, geometric, data, about, building, components, and, systems, on, some, projects, work, on, site, will, not, start, until, design, work, is, largely, complete, on, others, some, design, work, may, be, undertaken, concurrently, with, the, early, stages, of, on, site, activity, for, example, work, on, a, building, s, foundations, may, commence, while, designers, are, still, working, on, the, detailed, designs, of, the, building, s, internal, spaces, some, projects, may, include, elements, that, are, designed, for, off, site, construction, see, also, prefabrication, and, modular, building, and, are, then, delivered, to, the, site, ready, for, erection, installation, or, assembly, once, contractors, and, other, relevant, professionals, have, been, appointed, and, designs, are, sufficiently, advanced, work, may, commence, on, the, project, site, typically, a, construction, site, will, include, a, secure, perimeter, to, restrict, unauthorised, access, site, access, control, points, office, and, welfare, accommodation, for, personnel, from, the, main, contractor, and, other, firms, involved, in, the, project, team, and, storage, areas, for, materials, machinery, and, equipment, according, to, the, mcgraw, hill, dictionary, of, architecture, and, construction, s, definition, construction, may, be, said, to, have, started, when, the, first, feature, of, the, permanent, structure, has, been, put, in, place, such, as, pile, driving, or, the, pouring, of, slabs, or, footings, commissioning, is, the, process, of, verifying, that, all, subsystems, of, a, new, building, or, other, assets, work, as, intended, to, achieve, the, owner, s, project, requirements, and, as, designed, by, the, project, s, architects, and, engineers, a, period, after, handover, or, practical, completion, during, which, the, owner, may, identify, any, shortcomings, in, relation, to, the, building, specification, defects, with, a, view, to, the, contractor, correcting, the, defect, maintenance, involves, functional, checks, servicing, repairing, or, replacing, of, necessary, devices, equipment, machinery, building, infrastructure, and, supporting, utilities, in, industrial, business, governmental, and, residential, installations, demolition, is, the, discipline, of, safely, and, efficiently, tearing, down, buildings, and, other, artificial, structures, demolition, contrasts, with, deconstruction, which, involves, taking, a, building, apart, while, carefully, preserving, valuable, elements, for, reuse, purposes, recycling, see, also, circular, economy, the, output, of, the, global, construction, industry, was, worth, an, estimated, 10, 8, trillion, in, 2017, and, in, 2018, was, forecast, to, rise, to, 12, 9, trillion, by, 2022, and, to, around, 14, 8, trillion, in, 2030, as, a, sector, construction, accounts, for, more, than, 10, of, global, gdp, in, developed, countries, construction, comprises, 6, 9, of, gdp, and, employs, around, 7, of, the, total, employed, workforce, around, the, globe, accounting, for, over, 273, million, full, and, part, time, jobs, in, 2014, since, 2010, china, has, been, the, world, s, largest, single, construction, market, the, united, states, is, the, second, largest, construction, market, with, a, 2018, output, of, 1, 581, trillion, construction, is, a, major, source, of, employment, in, most, countries, high, reliance, on, small, businesses, and, under, representation, of, women, are, common, traits, for, example, according, to, mckinsey, research, productivity, growth, per, worker, in, construction, has, lagged, behind, many, other, industries, across, different, countries, including, in, the, united, states, and, in, european, countries, in, the, united, states, construction, productivity, per, worker, has, declined, by, half, since, the, 1960s, the, twenty, five, largest, countries, in, the, world, by, construction, gva, 2018, some, workers, may, be, engaged, in, manual, labour, as, unskilled, or, semi, skilled, workers, they, may, be, skilled, tradespeople, or, they, may, be, supervisory, or, managerial, personnel, under, safety, legislation, in, the, united, kingdom, for, example, construction, workers, are, defined, as, people, who, work, for, or, under, the, control, of, a, contractor, on, a, construction, site, in, canada, this, can, include, people, whose, work, includes, ensuring, conformance, with, building, codes, and, regulations, and, those, who, supervise, other, workers, laborers, comprise, a, large, grouping, in, most, national, construction, industries, in, the, united, states, for, example, in, may, 2021, the, construction, sector, employed, just, over, 7, 5, million, people, of, whom, just, over, 820, 000, were, laborers, while, 573, 000, were, carpenters, 508, 000, were, electricians, 258, 000, were, equipment, operators, and, 230, 000, were, construction, managers, like, most, business, sectors, there, is, also, substantial, white, collar, employment, in, construction, 681, 000, us, workers, were, recorded, by, the, united, states, department, of, labor, as, in, office, and, administrative, support, occupations, in, may, 2021, large, scale, construction, requires, collaboration, across, multiple, disciplines, a, project, manager, normally, manages, the, budget, on, the, job, and, a, construction, manager, design, engineer, construction, engineer, or, architect, supervises, it, those, involved, with, the, design, and, execution, must, consider, zoning, requirements, and, legal, issues, environmental, impact, of, the, project, scheduling, budgeting, and, bidding, construction, site, safety, availability, and, transportation, of, building, materials, logistics, and, inconvenience, to, the, public, including, those, caused, by, construction, delays, some, models, and, policy, making, organisations, promote, the, engagement, of, local, labour, in, construction, projects, as, a, means, of, tackling, social, exclusion, and, addressing, skill, shortages, in, the, uk, the, joseph, rowntree, foundation, reported, in, 2000, on, 25, projects, which, had, aimed, to, offer, training, and, employment, opportunities, for, locally, based, school, leavers, and, unemployed, people, the, foundation, published, a, good, practice, resource, book, in, this, regard, at, the, same, time, use, of, local, labour, and, local, materials, were, specified, for, the, construction, of, the, danish, storebaelt, bridge, but, there, were, legal, issues, which, were, challenged, in, court, and, addressed, by, the, european, court, of, justice, in, 1993, the, court, held, that, a, contract, condition, requiring, use, of, local, labour, and, local, materials, was, incompatible, with, eu, treaty, principles, later, uk, guidance, noted, that, social, and, employment, clauses, where, used, must, be, compatible, with, relevant, eu, regulation, employment, of, local, labour, was, identified, as, one, of, several, social, issues, which, could, potentially, be, incorporated, in, a, sustainable, procurement, approach, although, the, interdepartmental, sustainable, procurement, group, recognised, that, there, is, far, less, scope, to, incorporate, social, issues, in, public, procurement, than, is, the, case, with, environmental, issues, there, are, many, routes, to, the, different, careers, within, the, construction, industry, there, are, three, main, tiers, of, construction, workers, based, on, educational, background, and, training, which, vary, by, country, unskilled, and, semi, skilled, workers, provide, general, site, labor, often, have, few, or, no, construction, qualifications, and, may, receive, basic, site, training, skilled, tradespeople, have, typically, served, apprenticeships, sometimes, in, labor, unions, or, received, technical, training, this, group, also, includes, on, site, managers, who, possess, extensive, knowledge, and, experience, in, their, craft, or, profession, skilled, manual, occupations, include, carpenters, electricians, plumbers, ironworkers, heavy, equipment, operators, and, masons, as, well, as, those, involved, in, project, management, in, the, uk, these, require, further, education, qualifications, often, in, vocational, subject, areas, undertaken, either, directly, after, completing, compulsory, education, or, through, on, the, job, apprenticeships, professional, technical, and, managerial, personnel, often, have, higher, education, qualifications, usually, graduate, degrees, and, are, trained, to, design, and, manage, construction, processes, these, roles, require, more, training, as, they, demand, greater, technical, knowledge, and, involve, more, legal, responsibility, example, roles, and, qualification, routes, include, construction, is, one, of, the, most, dangerous, occupations, in, the, world, incurring, more, occupational, fatalities, than, any, other, sector, in, both, the, united, states, and, in, the, european, union, in, the, us, in, 2019, 1, 061, or, about, 20, of, worker, fatalities, in, private, industry, occurred, in, construction, in, 2017, more, than, a, third, of, us, construction, fatalities, 366, out, of, 971, total, fatalities, were, the, result, of, falls, in, the, uk, half, of, the, average, 36, fatalities, per, annum, over, a, five, year, period, to, 2021, were, attributed, to, falls, from, height, proper, safety, equipment, such, as, harnesses, hard, hats, and, guardrails, and, procedures, such, as, securing, ladders, and, inspecting, scaffolding, can, curtail, the, risk, of, occupational, injuries, in, the, construction, industry, other, major, causes, of, fatalities, in, the, construction, industry, include, electrocution, transportation, accidents, and, trench, cave, ins, other, safety, risks, for, workers, in, construction, include, hearing, loss, due, to, high, noise, exposure, musculoskeletal, injury, chemical, exposure, and, high, levels, of, stress, besides, that, the, high, turnover, of, workers, in, construction, industry, imposes, a, huge, challenge, of, accomplishing, the, restructuring, of, work, practices, in, individual, workplaces, or, with, individual, workers, construction, has, been, identified, by, the, national, institute, for, occupational, safety, and, health, niosh, as, a, priority, industry, sector, in, the, national, occupational, research, agenda, nora, to, identify, and, provide, intervention, strategies, regarding, occupational, health, and, safety, issues, a, study, conducted, in, 2022, found, significant, effect, of, air, pollution, exposure, on, construction, related, injuries, and, fatalities, especially, with, the, exposure, of, nitrogen, dioxide, sustainability, is, an, aspect, of, green, building, defined, by, the, united, states, environmental, protection, agency, epa, as, the, practice, of, creating, structures, and, using, processes, that, are, environmentally, responsible, and, resource, efficient, throughout, a, building, s, life, cycle, from, siting, to, design, construction, operation, maintenance, renovation, and, deconstruction, the, construction, industry, may, require, transformation, at, pace, and, at, scale, if, it, is, to, successfully, contribute, to, achieving, the, target, set, out, in, the, paris, agreement, of, limiting, global, temperature, rise, to, 1, 5c, above, industrial, levels, the, world, green, building, council, has, stated, the, buildings, and, infrastructure, around, the, world, can, reach, 40, less, embodied, carbon, emissions, but, that, this, can, only, be, achieved, through, urgent, transformation, conclusions, from, industry, leaders, have, suggested, that, the, net, zero, transformation, is, likely, to, be, challenging, for, the, construction, industry, but, it, does, present, an, opportunity, action, is, demanded, from, governments, standards, bodies, the, construction, sector, and, the, engineering, profession, to, meet, the, decarbonising, targets, in, 2021, the, national, engineering, policy, centre, published, its, report, decarbonising, construction, building, a, new, net, zero, industry, which, outlined, key, areas, to, decarbonise, the, construction, sector, and, the, wider, built, environment, this, report, set, out, around, 20, different, recommendations, to, transform, and, decarbonise, the, construction, sector, including, recommendations, for, engineers, the, construction, industry, and, decision, makers, plus, outlined, six, overarching, system, levers, where, action, taken, now, will, result, in, rapid, decarbonisation, of, the, construction, sector, these, levels, are, progress, is, being, made, internationally, to, decarbonise, the, sector, including, improvements, to, sustainable, procurement, practice, such, as, the, co2, performance, ladder, in, the, netherlands, and, the, danish, partnership, for, green, public, procurement, there, are, also, now, demonstrations, of, applying, the, principles, of, circular, economy, practices, in, practice, such, as, circl, abn, amro, s, sustainable, pavilion, and, the, brighton, waste, house, architecture, portal, engineering, portal
