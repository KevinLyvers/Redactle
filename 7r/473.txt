northeastern, nigeria, several, names, are, applied, to, the, language, just, as, to, the, fula, people, they, call, their, language, pulaar, or, pular, in, the, western, dialects, and, fulfulde, in, the, central, and, eastern, dialects, fula, fulah, and, fulani, in, english, come, originally, from, manding, esp, mandinka, but, also, malinke, and, bamana, and, hausa, respectively, peul, in, french, also, occasionally, found, in, literature, in, english, comes, from, wolof, fula, is, based, on, verbonominal, roots, from, which, verbal, noun, and, modifier, words, are, derived, it, uses, suffixes, sometimes, inaccurately, called, infixes, as, they, come, between, the, root, and, the, inflectional, ending, to, modify, meaning, these, suffixes, often, serve, the, same, purposes, in, fula, that, prepositions, do, in, english, the, fula, or, fulfulde, language, is, characterized, by, a, robust, noun, class, system, with, 24, to, 26, noun, classes, being, common, across, the, fulfulde, dialects, noun, classes, in, fula, are, abstract, categories, with, some, classes, having, semantic, attributes, that, characterize, a, subset, of, that, class, members, and, others, being, marked, by, a, membership, too, diverse, to, warrant, any, semantic, categorization, of, the, class, members, for, example, classes, are, for, stringy, long, things, and, another, for, big, things, another, for, liquids, a, noun, class, for, strong, rigid, objects, another, for, human, or, humanoid, traits, etc, gender, does, not, have, any, role, in, the, fula, noun, class, system, and, the, marking, of, gender, is, done, with, adjectives, rather, than, class, markers, noun, classes, are, marked, by, suffixes, on, nouns, these, suffixes, are, the, same, as, the, class, name, though, they, are, frequently, subject, to, phonological, processes, most, frequently, the, dropping, of, the, suffix, s, initial, consonant, the, table, below, illustrates, the, class, name, the, semantic, property, associated, with, class, membership, and, an, example, of, a, noun, with, its, class, marker, classes, 1, and, 2, can, be, described, as, personal, classes, classes, 3, 6, as, diminutive, classes, classes, 7, 8, as, augmentative, classes, and, classes, 9, 25, as, neutral, classes, it, is, formed, on, the, basis, of, mcintosh, s, 1984, description, of, kaceccereere, fulfulde, which, the, author, describes, as, essentially, the, same, as, david, arnott, s, 1970, description, of, the, noun, classes, of, the, gombe, dialect, of, fula, thus, certain, examples, from, arnott, also, informed, this, table, verbs, in, fula, are, usually, classed, in, three, voices, active, middle, and, passive, not, every, root, is, used, in, all, voices, some, middle, voice, verbs, are, reflexive, a, common, example, are, verbs, from, the, root, loot, another, feature, of, the, language, is, initial, consonant, mutation, between, singular, and, plural, forms, of, nouns, and, of, verbs, except, in, pular, no, consonant, mutation, exists, in, verbs, only, in, nouns, a, simplified, schema, is, fula, has, inclusive, and, exclusive, first, person, plural, pronouns, the, inclusive, pronouns, include, both, the, speaker, and, those, being, spoken, to, while, the, exclusive, pronouns, exclude, the, listeners, the, pronoun, that, corresponds, to, a, given, noun, is, determined, by, the, noun, class, because, men, and, women, belong, to, the, same, noun, class, the, english, pronouns, he, and, she, are, translated, into, fula, by, the, same, pronoun, however, depending, on, the, dialect, there, are, some, 25, different, noun, classes, each, with, its, own, pronoun, sometimes, those, pronouns, have, both, a, nominative, case, i, e, used, as, verb, subject, and, an, accusative, or, dative, case, i, e, used, as, a, verb, object, as, well, as, a, possessive, form, relative, pronouns, generally, take, the, same, form, as, the, nominative, while, there, are, numerous, varieties, of, fula, it, is, typically, regarded, as, a, single, language, wilson, 1989, states, that, travelers, over, wide, distances, never, find, communication, impossible, and, ka, 1991, concludes, that, despite, its, geographic, span, and, dialect, variation, fulfulde, is, still, fundamentally, one, language, however, ethnologue, has, found, that, nine, different, translations, are, needed, to, make, the, bible, comprehensible, for, most, fula, speakers, and, it, treats, these, varieties, as, separate, languages, they, are, listed, in, the, box, at, the, beginning, of, this, article, fulfulde, is,
