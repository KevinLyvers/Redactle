existed, as, independent, states, or, were, controlled, by, many, civilizations, including, china, the, mongols, the, tibetans, and, various, turkic, polities, the, uyghurs, gradually, started, to, become, islamized, in, the, 10th, century, and, most, uyghurs, identified, as, muslims, by, the, 16th, century, islam, has, since, played, an, important, role, in, uyghur, culture, and, identity, an, estimated, 80, of, xinjiang, s, uyghurs, still, live, in, the, tarim, basin, the, rest, of, xinjiang, s, uyghurs, mostly, live, in, r, mqi, the, capital, city, of, xinjiang, which, is, located, in, the, historical, region, of, dzungaria, the, largest, community, of, uyghurs, living, outside, of, xinjiang, are, the, taoyuan, uyghurs, of, north, central, hunan, s, taoyuan, county, significant, diasporic, communities, of, uyghurs, exist, in, other, turkic, countries, such, as, kazakhstan, kyrgyzstan, uzbekistan, and, turkey, smaller, communities, live, in, saudi, arabia, jordan, australia, russia, and, sweden, since, 2014, the, chinese, government, has, been, accused, by, various, organizations, such, as, human, rights, watch, of, subjecting, uyghurs, living, in, xinjiang, to, widespread, persecution, including, forced, sterilization, and, forced, labor, scholars, estimate, that, at, least, one, million, uyghurs, have, been, arbitrarily, detained, in, the, xinjiang, internment, camps, since, 2017, chinese, government, officials, claim, that, these, camps, created, under, ccp, general, secretary, xi, jinping, s, administration, serve, the, goals, of, ensuring, adherence, to, chinese, communist, party, ccp, ideology, preventing, separatism, fighting, terrorism, and, providing, vocational, training, to, uyghurs, various, scholars, human, rights, organizations, and, governments, consider, abuses, perpetrated, against, the, uyghurs, to, amount, to, crimes, against, humanity, or, even, genocide, in, the, uyghur, language, the, ethnonym, is, written, in, arabic, script, in, uyghur, cyrillic, and, uyghur, or, uygur, as, the, standard, chinese, romanization, gb, 3304, 1991, in, latin, they, are, all, pronounced, as, in, chinese, this, is, transcribed, into, characters, as, which, is, romanized, in, pinyin, as, w, iw, r, in, english, the, name, is, officially, spelled, uyghur, by, the, xinjiang, government, but, also, appears, as, uighur, uigur, and, uygur, these, reflect, the, various, cyrillic, spellings, and, the, name, is, usually, pronounced, in, english, as, w, i, r, r, wee, goor, g, r, and, thus, may, be, preceded, by, the, indefinite, article, a, although, some, uyghurs, advocate, the, use, of, a, more, native, pronunciation, u, i, r, oo, ee, goor, instead, which, in, contrast, calls, for, the, indefinite, article, an, the, term, s, original, meaning, is, unclear, old, turkic, inscriptions, record, the, word, uy, ur, old, turkic, an, example, is, found, on, the, sudzi, inscription, i, am, khan, ata, of, yaglaqar, came, from, the, uigur, land, old, turkic, uy, ur, jerinte, ya, laqar, qan, ata, keltim, it, is, transcribed, into, tang, annals, as, mandarin, hu, h, but, probably, in, middle, chinese, it, was, used, as, the, name, of, one, of, the, turkic, polities, formed, in, the, interim, between, the, first, and, second, g, kt, rk, khaganates, ad, 630, 684, the, old, history, of, the, five, dynasties, records, that, in, 788, or, 809, the, chinese, acceded, to, a, uyghur, request, and, emended, their, transcription, to, mandarin, hu, h, but, in, middle, chinese, modern, etymological, explanations, for, the, name, uyghur, range, from, derivation, from, the, verb, follow, accommodate, oneself, and, adjective, non, rebellious, i, e, from, turkic, uy, u, to, the, verb, meaning, wake, rouse, or, stir, i, e, from, turkic, o, ur, none, of, these, is, thought, to, be, satisfactory, because, the, sound, shift, of, and, to, j, does, not, appear, to, be, in, place, by, this, time, the, etymology, therefore, cannot, be, conclusively, determined, and, its, referent, is, also, difficult, to, fix, the, huihe, and, huihu, seem, to, be, a, political, rather, than, a, tribal, designation, or, it, may, be, one, group, among, several, others, collectively, known, as, the, toquz, oghuz, the, name, fell, out, of, use, in, the, 15th, century, but, was, reintroduced, in, the, early, 20th, century, by, the, soviet, bolsheviks, to, replace, the, previous, terms, turk, and, turki, the, name, is, currently, used, to, refer, to, the, settled, turkic, urban, dwellers, and, farmers, of, the, tarim, basin, who, follow, traditional, central, asian, sedentary, practices, distinguishable, from, the, nomadic, turkic, populations, in, central, asia, the, earliest, record, of, a, uyghur, tribe, appears, in, accounts, from, the, northern, wei, 4th, 6th, century, a, d, wherein, they, were, named, yuanhe, mc, zs, n, t, and, derived, from, a, confederation, named, lit, high, carts, read, as, g, och, in, mandarin, chinese, but, originally, with, the, reconstructed, middle, chinese, pronunciation, later, known, as, the, tiele, ti, l, g, och, in, turn, has, been, connected, to, the, uyghur, qangqil, or, throughout, its, history, the, term, uyghur, has, had, an, increasingly, expansive, definition, initially, signifying, only, a, small, coalition, of, tiele, tribes, in, northern, china, mongolia, and, the, altai, mountains, it, later, denoted, citizenship, in, the, uyghur, khaganate, finally, it, was, expanded, into, an, ethnicity, whose, ancestry, originates, with, the, fall, of, the, uyghur, khaganate, in, the, year, 842, causing, uyghur, migration, from, mongolia, into, the, tarim, basin, the, uyghurs, who, moved, to, the, tarim, basin, mixed, with, the, local, tocharians, and, converted, to, the, tocharian, religion, and, adopted, their, culture, of, oasis, agriculture, the, fluid, definition, of, uyghur, and, the, diverse, ancestry, of, modern, uyghurs, create, confusion, as, to, what, constitutes, true, uyghur, ethnography, and, ethnogenesis, contemporary, scholars, consider, modern, uyghurs, to, be, the, descendants, of, a, number, of, peoples, including, the, ancient, uyghurs, of, mongolia, migrating, into, the, tarim, basin, after, the, fall, of, the, uyghur, khaganate, iranic, saka, tribes, and, other, indo, european, peoples, inhabiting, the, tarim, basin, before, the, arrival, of, the, turkic, uyghurs, uyghur, activists, identify, with, the, tarim, mummies, remains, of, an, ancient, people, inhabiting, the, region, but, research, into, the, genetics, of, ancient, tarim, mummies, and, their, links, with, modern, uyghurs, remains, problematic, both, to, chinese, government, officials, concerned, with, ethnic, separatism, and, to, uyghur, activists, concerned, the, research, could, affect, their, indigenous, claim, a, genomic, study, published, in, 2021, found, that, these, early, mummies, had, high, levels, of, ancient, north, eurasian, ancestry, ane, about, 72, with, smaller, admixture, from, ancient, northeast, asians, ana, about, 28, but, no, detectable, western, steppe, related, ancestry, they, formed, a, genetically, isolated, local, population, that, adopted, neighbouring, pastoralist, and, agriculturalist, practices, which, allowed, them, to, settle, and, thrive, along, the, shifting, riverine, oases, of, the, taklamakan, desert, these, mummified, individuals, were, long, suspected, to, have, been, proto, tocharian, speaking, pastoralists, ancestors, of, the, tocharians, but, the, authors, of, this, study, found, no, genetic, connection, with, indo, european, speaking, migrants, particularly, the, afanasievo, or, bmac, cultures, the, uighurs, are, the, people, whom, old, russian, travelers, called, sart, a, name, they, used, for, sedentary, turkish, speaking, central, asians, in, general, while, western, travelers, called, them, turki, in, recognition, of, their, language, the, chinese, used, to, call, them, ch, an, t, ou, turbaned, heads, but, this, term, has, been, dropped, being, considered, derogatory, and, the, chinese, using, their, own, pronunciation, now, called, them, weiwuerh, as, a, matter, of, fact, there, was, for, centuries, no, national, name, for, them, people, identified, themselves, with, the, oasis, they, came, from, such, as, kashgar, or, turfan, the, term, uyghur, was, not, used, to, refer, to, a, specific, existing, ethnicity, in, the, 19th, century, it, referred, to, an, ancient, people, a, late, 19th, century, encyclopedia, entitled, the, cyclop, dia, of, india, and, of, eastern, and, southern, asia, said, the, uigur, are, the, most, ancient, of, turkish, tribes, and, formerly, inhabited, a, part, of, chinese, tartary, xinjiang, now, occupied, by, a, mixed, population, of, turk, mongol, and, kalmuck, before, 1921, 1934, western, writers, called, the, turkic, speaking, muslims, of, the, oases, turki, and, the, turkic, muslims, who, had, migrated, from, the, tarim, basin, to, ili, r, mqi, and, dzungaria, in, the, northern, portion, of, xinjiang, during, the, qing, dynasty, were, known, as, taranchi, meaning, farmer, the, russians, and, other, foreigners, referred, to, them, as, sart, turk, or, turki, in, the, early, 20th, century, they, identified, themselves, by, different, names, to, different, peoples, and, in, response, to, different, inquiries, they, called, themselves, sarts, in, front, of, kazakhs, and, kyrgyz, while, they, called, themselves, chantou, if, asked, about, their, identity, after, first, identifying, as, a, muslim, the, term, chantou, ch, nt, u, meaning, turban, head, was, used, to, refer, to, the, turkic, muslims, of, altishahr, now, southern, xinjiang, including, by, hui, tungan, people, these, groups, of, peoples, often, identify, themselves, by, their, originating, oasis, instead, of, an, ethnicity, for, example, those, from, kashgar, may, refer, to, themselves, as, kashgarliq, or, kashgari, while, those, from, hotan, identity, themselves, as, hotani, other, central, asians, once, called, all, the, inhabitants, of, xinjiang, s, southern, oases, kashgari, a, term, still, used, in, some, regions, of, pakistan, the, turkic, people, also, used, musulman, which, means, muslim, to, describe, themselves, rian, thum, explored, the, concepts, of, identity, among, the, ancestors, of, the, modern, uyghurs, in, altishahr, the, native, uyghur, name, for, eastern, turkestan, or, southern, xinjiang, before, the, adoption, of, the, name, uyghur, in, the, 1930s, referring, to, them, by, the, name, altishahri, in, his, article, modular, history, identity, maintenance, before, uyghur, nationalism, thum, indicated, that, altishahri, turkis, did, have, a, sense, that, they, were, a, distinctive, group, separate, from, the, turkic, andijanis, to, their, west, the, nomadic, turkic, kirghiz, the, nomadic, mongol, qalmaq, and, the, han, chinese, khitay, before, they, became, known, as, uyghurs, there, was, no, single, name, used, for, their, identity, various, native, names, altishahris, used, for, identify, were, altishahrlik, altishahr, person, yerlik, local, turki, and, musulm, n, muslim, the, term, musulm, n, in, this, situation, did, not, signify, religious, connotations, because, the, altishahris, exclude, other, muslim, peoples, like, the, kirghiz, while, identifying, themselves, as, musulm, n, dr, laura, j, newby, says, the, sedentary, altishahri, turkic, people, considered, themselves, separate, from, other, turkic, muslims, since, at, least, the, 19th, century, the, name, uyghur, reappeared, after, the, soviet, union, took, the, 9th, century, ethnonym, from, the, uyghur, khaganate, then, reapplied, it, to, all, non, nomadic, turkic, muslims, of, xinjiang, it, followed, western, european, orientalists, like, julius, klaproth, in, the, 19th, century, who, revived, the, name, and, spread, the, use, of, the, term, to, local, turkic, intellectuals, and, a, 19th, century, proposal, from, russian, historians, that, modern, day, uyghurs, were, descended, from, the, kingdom, of, qocho, and, kara, khanid, khanate, formed, after, the, dissolution, of, the, uyghur, khaganate, historians, generally, agree, that, the, adoption, of, the, term, uyghur, is, based, on, a, decision, from, a, 1921, conference, in, tashkent, attended, by, turkic, muslims, from, the, tarim, basin, xinjiang, there, uyghur, was, chosen, by, them, as, the, name, of, their, ethnicity, although, they, themselves, note, that, they, were, not, to, be, confused, with, the, uyghur, empire, of, medieval, history, according, to, linda, benson, the, soviets, and, their, client, sheng, shicai, intended, to, foster, a, uyghur, nationality, to, divide, the, muslim, population, of, xinjiang, whereas, the, various, turkic, muslim, peoples, preferred, to, identify, themselves, as, turki, east, turkestani, or, muslim, on, the, other, hand, the, ruling, regime, of, china, at, that, time, the, kuomintang, grouped, all, muslims, including, the, turkic, speaking, people, of, xinjiang, into, the, hui, nationality, the, qing, dynasty, and, the, kuomintang, generally, referred, to, the, sedentary, oasis, dwelling, turkic, muslims, of, xinjiang, as, turban, headed, hui, to, differentiate, them, from, other, predominantly, muslim, ethnicities, in, china, in, the, 1930s, foreigners, travelers, in, xinjiang, such, as, george, w, hunter, peter, fleming, ella, maillart, and, sven, hedin, referred, to, the, turkic, muslims, of, the, region, as, turki, in, their, books, use, of, the, term, uyghur, was, unknown, in, xinjiang, until, 1934, the, area, governor, sheng, shicai, came, to, power, adopting, the, soviet, ethnographic, classification, instead, of, the, kuomintang, s, and, became, the, first, to, promulgate, the, official, use, of, the, term, uyghur, to, describe, the, turkic, muslims, of, xinjiang, uyghur, replaced, rag, head, sheng, shicai, s, introduction, of, the, uighur, name, for, the, turkic, people, of, xinjiang, was, criticized, and, rejected, by, turki, intellectuals, such, as, pan, turkist, jadids, and, east, turkestan, independence, activists, muhammad, amin, bughra, mehmet, emin, and, masud, sabri, they, demanded, the, names, t, rk, or, t, rki, be, used, instead, as, the, ethnonyms, for, their, people, masud, sabri, viewed, the, hui, people, as, muslim, han, chinese, and, separate, from, his, people, while, bughrain, criticized, sheng, for, his, designation, of, turkic, muslims, into, different, ethnicities, which, could, sow, disunion, among, turkic, muslims, after, the, communist, victory, the, chinese, communist, party, under, chairman, mao, zedong, continued, the, soviet, classification, using, the, term, uyghur, to, describe, the, modern, ethnicity, in, current, usage, uyghur, refers, to, settled, turkic, speaking, urban, dwellers, and, farmers, of, the, tarim, basin, and, ili, who, follow, traditional, central, asian, sedentary, practices, as, distinguished, from, nomadic, turkic, populations, in, central, asia, however, chinese, government, agents, designate, as, uyghur, certain, peoples, with, significantly, divergent, histories, and, ancestries, from, the, main, group, these, include, the, lopliks, of, ruoqiang, county, and, the, dolan, people, thought, to, be, closer, to, the, oirat, mongols, and, the, kyrgyz, the, use, of, the, term, uyghur, led, to, anachronisms, when, describing, the, history, of, the, people, in, one, of, his, books, the, term, uyghur, was, deliberately, not, used, by, james, millward, another, ethnicity, the, western, yugur, of, gansu, identify, themselves, as, the, yellow, uyghur, sar, q, uyghur, some, scholars, say, the, yugurs, culture, language, and, religion, are, closer, to, the, original, culture, of, the, original, uyghur, karakorum, state, than, is, the, culture, of, the, modern, uyghur, people, of, xinjiang, linguist, and, ethnographer, s, robert, ramsey, argues, for, inclusion, of, both, the, eastern, and, western, yugur, and, the, salar, as, sub, groups, of, the, uyghur, based, on, similar, historical, roots, for, the, yugur, and, on, perceived, linguistic, similarities, for, the, salar, turkistani, is, used, as, an, alternate, ethnonym, by, some, uyghurs, for, example, the, uyghur, diaspora, in, arabia, adopted, the, identity, turkistani, some, uyghurs, in, saudi, arabia, adopted, the, arabic, nisba, of, their, home, city, such, as, al, kashgari, from, kashgar, saudi, born, uyghur, hamza, kashgari, s, family, originated, from, kashgar, the, uyghur, population, within, china, generally, remains, centered, in, xinjiang, region, with, some, smaller, subpopulations, elsewhere, in, the, country, such, as, in, taoyuan, county, where, an, estimated, 5, 000, 10, 000, live, the, size, of, the, uyghur, population, particularly, in, china, has, been, the, subject, of, dispute, chinese, authorities, place, the, uyghur, population, within, the, xinjiang, region, to, be, just, over, 12, million, comprising, approximately, half, of, the, total, regional, population, as, early, as, 2003, however, some, uyghur, groups, wrote, that, their, population, was, being, vastly, undercounted, by, chinese, authorities, claiming, that, their, population, actually, exceeded, 20, million, population, disputes, have, continued, into, the, present, with, some, activists, and, groups, such, as, the, world, uyghur, congress, and, uyghur, american, association, claiming, that, the, uyghur, population, ranges, between, 20, and, 30, million, some, have, even, claimed, that, the, real, number, of, uyghurs, is, actually, 35, million, scholars, however, have, generally, rejected, these, claims, with, professor, dru, c, gladney, writing, in, the, 2004, book, xinjiang, china, s, muslim, borderland, that, there, is, scant, evidence, to, support, uyghur, claims, that, their, population, within, china, exceeds, 20, million, a, study, of, mitochondrial, dna, 2004, therefore, the, matrilineal, genetic, contribution, found, the, frequency, of, western, eurasian, specific, haplogroup, in, uyghurs, to, be, 42, 6, and, east, asian, haplogroup, to, be, 57, 4, uyghurs, in, kazakhstan, on, the, other, hand, were, shown, to, have, 55, european, western, eurasian, maternal, mtdna, a, study, based, on, paternal, dna, 2005, shows, west, eurasian, haplogroups, j, and, r, in, uyghurs, make, up, 65, to, 70, and, east, asian, haplogroups, c, n, d, and, o, 30, to, 35, one, study, by, xu, et, al, 2008, using, samples, from, hetian, hotan, only, found, uyghurs, have, about, an, average, of, 60, european, or, west, asian, western, eurasian, ancestry, and, about, 40, east, asian, or, siberian, ancestry, eastern, eurasian, from, the, same, area, it, is, found, that, the, proportion, of, uyghur, individuals, with, european, west, asian, ancestry, ranges, individually, from, 40, 3, to, 84, 3, while, their, east, asian, siberian, ancestry, ranges, individually, from, 15, 7, to, 59, 7, further, study, by, the, same, team, showed, an, average, of, slightly, greater, european, west, asian, component, at, 52, ranging, individually, from, 44, 9, to, 63, 1, in, the, uyghur, population, in, southern, xinjiang, but, only, 47, ranging, individually, from, 30, to, 55, in, the, northern, uyghur, population, a, different, study, by, li, et, al, 2009, used, a, larger, sample, of, individuals, from, a, wider, area, and, found, a, higher, east, asian, component, of, about, 70, on, average, while, the, european, west, asian, component, was, about, 30, overall, uyghur, show, relative, more, similarity, to, western, east, asians, than, to, eastern, east, asians, the, authors, also, cite, anthropologic, studies, which, also, estimate, about, 30, western, proportions, which, are, in, agreement, with, their, genetic, results, a, study, 2013, based, on, autosomal, dna, shows, that, average, uyghurs, are, closest, to, other, turkic, people, in, central, asia, and, china, as, well, as, various, chinese, populations, the, analysis, of, the, diversity, of, cytochrome, b, further, suggests, uyghurs, are, closer, to, chinese, and, siberian, populations, than, to, various, caucasoid, groups, in, west, asia, or, europe, however, there, is, significant, genetic, distance, between, the, xinjiang, s, southern, uyghurs, and, chinese, population, but, not, between, the, northern, uyghurs, and, chinese, a, study, 2016, of, uyghur, males, living, in, southern, xinjiang, used, high, resolution, 26, y, str, loci, system, high, resolution, to, infer, the, genetic, relationships, between, the, uyghur, population, and, european, and, asian, populations, the, results, showed, the, uyghur, population, of, southern, xinjiang, exhibited, a, genetic, admixture, of, eastern, asian, and, european, populations, but, with, slightly, closer, relationship, with, european, populations, than, to, eastern, asian, populations, an, extensive, genome, study, in, 2017, analyzed, 951, samples, of, uyghurs, from, 14, geographical, subpopulations, in, xinjiang, and, observed, a, southwest, and, northeast, differentiation, in, the, population, partially, caused, by, the, tianshan, mountains, which, form, a, natural, barrier, with, gene, flows, from, the, east, and, west, the, study, identifies, four, major, ancestral, components, that, may, have, arisen, from, two, earlier, admixed, groups, one, that, migrated, from, the, west, harbouring, a, west, eurasian, component, associated, with, european, ancestry, 25, 37, and, a, south, asian, ancestry, component, 12, 20, and, one, from, the, east, harbouring, a, siberian, ancestry, component, 15, 17, and, an, east, asian, ancestry, component, 29, 47, in, total, uyghurs, on, average, are, 33, 3, west, eurasian, 32, 9, east, asian, 17, 9, south, asian, and, 16, siberian, western, parts, of, xinjiang, are, more, west, eurasian, components, than, east, eurasian, it, suggests, at, least, two, major, waves, of, admixture, one, 3, 750, years, ago, coinciding, with, the, age, range, of, the, mummies, with, european, feature, found, in, xinjiang, and, another, occurring, around, 750, years, ago, a, 2018, study, of, 206, uyghur, samples, from, xinjiang, using, the, ancestry, informative, snp, aisnp, analysis, found, that, the, average, genetic, ancestry, of, uyghurs, is, 63, 7, east, asian, related, and, 36, 3, european, related, the, history, of, the, uyghur, people, as, with, the, ethnic, origin, of, the, people, is, a, matter, of, contention, uyghur, historians, viewed, the, uyghurs, as, the, original, inhabitants, of, xinjiang, with, a, long, history, uyghur, politician, and, historian, muhammad, amin, bughra, wrote, in, his, book, a, history, of, east, turkestan, stressing, the, turkic, aspects, of, his, people, that, the, turks, have, a, continuous, 9000, year, old, history, while, historian, turghun, almas, incorporated, discoveries, of, tarim, mummies, to, conclude, that, uyghurs, have, over, 6400, years, of, continuous, history, and, the, world, uyghur, congress, claimed, a, 4, 000, year, history, in, east, turkestan, however, the, official, chinese, view, as, documented, in, the, white, paper, history, and, development, of, xinjiang, asserts, that, the, uyghur, ethnic, group, formed, after, the, collapse, of, the, uyghur, khaganate, in, 840, when, the, local, residents, of, the, tarim, basin, and, its, surrounding, areas, were, merged, with, migrants, from, the, khaganate, the, name, uyghur, reappeared, after, the, soviet, union, took, the, 9th, century, ethnonym, from, the, uyghur, khaganate, then, reapplied, it, to, all, non, nomadic, turkic, muslims, of, xinjiang, many, contemporary, western, scholars, however, do, not, consider, the, modern, uyghurs, to, be, of, direct, linear, descent, from, the, old, uyghur, khaganate, of, mongolia, rather, they, consider, them, to, be, descendants, of, a, number, of, peoples, one, of, them, the, ancient, uyghurs, discovery, of, well, preserved, tarim, mummies, of, a, people, european, in, appearance, indicates, the, migration, of, a, european, looking, people, into, the, tarim, area, at, the, beginning, of, the, bronze, age, around, 1800, bc, these, people, may, have, been, of, tocharian, origin, and, some, have, suggested, them, to, be, the, yuezhi, mentioned, in, ancient, chinese, texts, the, tocharians, are, thought, to, have, developed, from, the, indo, european, speaking, afanasevo, culture, of, southern, siberia, c, 3500, 2500, bc, a, study, published, in, 2021, showed, that, the, earliest, tarim, basin, cultures, had, high, levels, of, ancient, north, eurasian, ancestry, with, smaller, admixture, from, northeast, asians, uyghur, activist, turgun, almas, claimed, that, tarim, mummies, were, uyghurs, because, the, earliest, uyghurs, practiced, shamanism, and, the, buried, mummies, orientation, suggests, that, they, had, been, shamanists, meanwhile, qurban, w, li, claimed, words, written, in, kharosthi, and, sogdian, scripts, as, uyghur, rather, than, sogdian, words, absorbed, into, uyghur, according, to, other, linguists, later, migrations, brought, peoples, from, the, west, and, northwest, to, the, xinjiang, region, probably, speakers, of, various, iranian, languages, such, as, the, saka, tribes, who, were, closely, related, to, the, european, scythians, and, descended, from, the, earlier, andronovo, culture, and, who, may, have, been, present, in, the, khotan, and, kashgar, area, in, the, first, millennium, bc, as, well, as, the, sogdians, who, formed, networks, of, trading, communities, across, the, tarim, basin, from, the, 4th, century, ad, there, may, also, be, an, indian, component, as, the, founding, legend, of, khotan, suggests, that, the, city, was, founded, by, indians, from, ancient, taxila, during, the, reign, of, ashoka, other, people, in, the, region, mentioned, in, ancient, chinese, texts, include, the, dingling, as, well, as, the, xiongnu, who, fought, for, supremacy, in, the, region, against, the, chinese, for, several, hundred, years, some, uyghur, nationalists, also, claimed, descent, from, the, xiongnu, according, to, the, chinese, historical, text, the, book, of, wei, the, founder, of, the, uyghurs, was, descended, from, a, xiongnu, ruler, but, the, view, is, contested, by, modern, chinese, scholars, the, yuezhi, were, driven, away, by, the, xiongnu, but, founded, the, kushan, empire, which, exerted, some, influence, in, the, tarim, basin, where, kharosthi, texts, have, been, found, in, loulan, niya, and, khotan, loulan, and, khotan, were, some, of, the, many, city, states, that, existed, in, the, xinjiang, region, during, the, han, dynasty, others, include, kucha, turfan, karasahr, and, kashgar, these, kingdoms, in, the, tarim, basin, came, under, the, control, of, china, during, the, han, and, tang, dynasties, during, the, tang, dynasty, they, were, conquered, and, placed, under, the, control, of, the, protectorate, general, to, pacify, the, west, and, the, indo, european, cultures, of, these, kingdoms, never, recovered, from, tang, rule, after, thousands, of, their, inhabitants, were, killed, during, the, conquest, the, settled, population, of, these, cities, later, merged, with, the, incoming, turkic, people, including, the, uyghurs, of, uyghur, khaganate, to, form, the, modern, uyghurs, the, indo, european, tocharian, language, later, disappeared, as, the, urban, population, switched, to, a, turkic, language, such, as, the, old, uyghur, language, the, early, turkic, peoples, descended, from, agricultural, communities, in, northeast, asia, who, moved, westwards, into, mongolia, in, the, late, 3rd, millennium, bc, where, they, adopted, a, pastoral, lifestyle, by, the, early, 1st, millennium, bc, these, peoples, had, become, equestrian, nomads, in, subsequent, centuries, the, steppe, populations, of, central, asia, appear, to, have, been, progressively, turkified, by, east, asian, nomadic, turks, moving, out, of, mongolia, the, uyghurs, of, the, uyghur, khaganate, were, part, of, a, turkic, confederation, called, the, tiele, who, lived, in, the, valleys, south, of, lake, baikal, and, around, the, yenisei, river, they, overthrew, the, first, turkic, khaganate, and, established, the, uyghur, khaganate, the, uyghur, khaganate, lasted, from, 744, to, 840, it, was, administered, from, the, imperial, capital, ordu, baliq, one, of, the, biggest, ancient, cities, built, in, mongolia, in, 840, following, a, famine, and, civil, war, the, uyghur, khaganate, was, overrun, by, the, yenisei, kirghiz, another, turkic, people, as, a, result, the, majority, of, tribal, groups, formerly, under, uyghur, control, dispersed, and, moved, out, of, mongolia, the, uyghurs, who, founded, the, uyghur, khaganate, dispersed, after, the, fall, of, the, khaganate, to, live, among, the, karluks, and, to, places, such, as, jimsar, turpan, and, gansu, these, uyghurs, soon, founded, two, kingdoms, and, the, easternmost, state, was, the, ganzhou, kingdom, 870, 1036, which, ruled, parts, of, xinjiang, with, its, capital, near, present, day, zhangye, gansu, china, the, modern, yugurs, are, believed, to, be, descendants, of, these, uyghurs, ganzhou, was, absorbed, by, the, western, xia, in, 1036, the, second, uyghur, kingdom, the, kingdom, of, qocho, ruled, a, larger, section, of, xinjiang, also, known, as, uyghuristan, in, its, later, period, was, founded, in, the, turpan, area, with, its, capital, in, qocho, modern, gaochang, and, beshbalik, the, kingdom, of, qocho, lasted, from, the, ninth, to, the, fourteenth, century, and, proved, to, be, longer, lasting, than, any, power, in, the, region, before, or, since, the, uyghurs, were, originally, tengrists, shamanists, and, manichaean, but, converted, to, buddhism, during, this, period, qocho, accepted, the, qara, khitai, as, its, overlord, in, the, 1130s, and, in, 1209, submitted, voluntarily, to, the, rising, mongol, empire, the, uyghurs, of, kingdom, of, qocho, were, allowed, significant, autonomy, and, played, an, important, role, as, civil, servants, to, the, mongol, empire, but, was, finally, destroyed, by, the, chagatai, khanate, by, the, end, of, the, 14th, century, in, the, tenth, century, the, karluks, yagmas, chigils, and, other, turkic, tribes, founded, the, kara, khanid, khanate, in, semirechye, western, tian, shan, and, kashgaria, and, later, conquered, transoxiana, the, karakhanid, rulers, were, likely, to, be, yaghmas, who, were, associated, with, the, toquz, oghuz, and, some, historians, therefore, see, this, as, a, link, between, the, karakhanid, and, the, uyghurs, of, the, uyghur, khaganate, although, this, connection, is, disputed, by, others, the, karakhanids, converted, to, islam, in, the, tenth, century, beginning, with, sultan, satuq, bughra, khan, the, first, turkic, dynasty, to, do, so, modern, uyghurs, see, the, muslim, karakhanids, as, an, important, part, of, their, history, however, islamization, of, the, people, of, the, tarim, basin, was, a, gradual, process, the, indo, iranian, saka, buddhist, kingdom, of, khotan, was, conquered, by, the, turkic, muslim, karakhanids, from, kashgar, in, the, early, 11th, century, but, uyghur, qocho, remained, mainly, buddhist, until, the, 15th, century, and, the, conversion, of, the, uyghur, people, to, islam, was, not, completed, until, the, 17th, century, the, 12th, and, 13th, century, saw, the, domination, by, non, muslim, powers, first, the, kara, khitans, in, the, 12th, century, followed, by, the, mongols, in, the, 13th, century, after, the, death, of, genghis, khan, in, 1227, transoxiana, and, kashgar, became, the, domain, of, his, second, son, chagatai, khan, the, chagatai, khanate, split, into, two, in, the, 1340s, and, the, area, of, the, chagatai, khanate, where, the, modern, uyghurs, live, became, part, of, moghulistan, which, meant, land, of, the, mongols, in, the, 14th, century, a, chagatayid, khan, tughluq, tem, r, converted, to, islam, genghisid, mongol, nobilities, also, followed, him, to, convert, to, islam, his, son, khizr, khoja, conquered, qocho, and, turfan, the, core, of, uyghuristan, in, the, 1390s, and, the, uyghurs, there, became, largely, muslim, by, the, beginning, of, the, 16th, century, after, being, converted, to, islam, the, descendants, of, the, previously, buddhist, uyghurs, in, turfan, failed, to, retain, memory, of, their, ancestral, legacy, and, falsely, believed, that, the, infidel, kalmuks, dzungars, were, the, ones, who, built, buddhist, structures, in, their, area, from, the, late, 14th, through, 17th, centuries, the, xinjiang, region, became, further, subdivided, into, moghulistan, in, the, north, altishahr, kashgar, and, the, tarim, basin, and, the, turfan, area, each, often, ruled, separately, by, competing, chagatayid, descendants, the, dughlats, and, later, the, khojas, islam, was, also, spread, by, the, sufis, and, branches, of, its, naqshbandi, order, were, the, khojas, who, seized, control, of, political, and, military, affairs, in, the, tarim, basin, and, turfan, in, the, 17th, century, the, khojas, however, split, into, two, rival, factions, the, aqtaghlik, white, mountainers, khojas, also, called, the, afaqiyya, and, the, qarataghlik, black, mountainers, khojas, also, called, the, ishaqiyya, the, legacy, of, the, khojas, lasted, until, the, 19th, century, the, qarataghlik, khojas, seized, power, in, yarkand, where, the, chagatai, khans, ruled, in, the, yarkent, khanate, forcing, the, aqtaghlik, afaqi, khoja, into, exile, in, the, 17th, century, the, buddhist, dzungar, khanate, grew, in, power, in, dzungaria, the, dzungar, conquest, of, altishahr, ended, the, last, independent, chagatai, khanate, the, yarkent, khanate, after, the, aqtaghlik, afaq, khoja, sought, aid, from, the, 5th, dalai, lama, and, his, dzungar, buddhist, followers, to, help, him, in, his, struggle, against, the, qarataghlik, khojas, the, aqtaghlik, khojas, in, the, tarim, basin, then, became, vassals, to, the, dzungars, the, expansion, of, the, dzungars, into, khalkha, mongol, territory, in, mongolia, brought, them, into, direct, conflict, with, qing, china, in, the, late, 17th, century, and, in, the, process, also, brought, chinese, presence, back, into, the, region, a, thousand, years, after, tang, china, lost, control, of, the, western, regions, the, dzungar, qing, war, lasted, a, decade, during, the, dzungar, conflict, two, aqtaghlik, brothers, the, so, called, younger, khoja, chinese, also, known, as, khw, ja, i, jah, n, and, his, sibling, the, elder, khoja, chinese, also, known, as, burh, n, al, d, n, after, being, appointed, as, vassals, in, the, tarim, basin, by, the, dzungars, first, joined, the, qing, and, rebelled, against, dzungar, rule, until, the, final, qing, victory, over, the, dzungars, then, they, rebelled, against, the, qing, in, the, revolt, of, the, altishahr, khojas, 1757, 1759, an, action, which, prompted, the, invasion, and, conquest, of, the, tarim, basin, by, the, qing, in, 1759, the, uyghurs, of, turfan, and, hami, such, as, emin, khoja, were, allies, of, the, qing, in, this, conflict, and, these, uyghurs, also, helped, the, qing, rule, the, altishahr, uyghurs, in, the, tarim, basin, the, final, campaign, against, the, dzungars, in, the, 1750s, ended, with, the, dzungar, genocide, the, qing, final, solution, of, genocide, to, solve, the, problem, of, the, dzungar, mongols, created, a, land, devoid, of, dzungars, which, was, followed, by, the, qing, sponsored, settlement, of, millions, of, other, people, in, dzungaria, in, northern, xinjiang, the, qing, brought, in, han, hui, uyghur, xibe, daurs, solons, turkic, muslim, taranchis, and, kazakh, colonists, with, one, third, of, xinjiang, s, total, population, consisting, of, hui, and, han, in, the, northern, area, while, around, two, thirds, were, uyghurs, in, southern, xinjiang, s, tarim, basin, in, dzungaria, the, qing, established, new, cities, like, r, mqi, and, yining, the, dzungarian, basin, itself, is, now, inhabited, by, many, kazakhs, the, qing, therefore, unified, xinjiang, and, changed, its, demographic, composition, as, well, 71, the, crushing, of, the, buddhist, dzungars, by, the, qing, led, to, the, empowerment, of, the, muslim, begs, in, southern, xinjiang, migration, of, muslim, taranchis, to, northern, xinjiang, and, increasing, turkic, muslim, power, with, turkic, muslim, culture, and, identity, was, tolerated, or, even, promoted, by, the, qing, 76, it, was, therefore, argued, by, henry, schwarz, that, the,
