cebuano, s, b, w, n, o, se, bwah, noh, is, an, austronesian, language, spoken, in, the, southern, philippines, it, is, natively, though, informally, called, by, its, generic, term, bisay, or, binisay, both, terms, are, translated, into, english, as, visayan, though, this, should, not, be, confused, with, other, bisayan, languages, and, sometimes, referred, to, in, english, sources, as, cebuan, s, b, u, n, seb, oo, n, it, is, spoken, by, the, visayan, ethnolinguistic, groups, native, to, the, islands, of, cebu, bohol, siquijor, the, eastern, half, of, negros, the, western, half, of, leyte, and, the, northern, coastal, areas, of, northern, mindanao, and, the, eastern, part, of, zamboanga, del, norte, due, to, spanish, settlements, during, 18th, century, in, modern, times, it, has, also, spread, to, the, davao, region, cotabato, camiguin, parts, of, the, dinagat, islands, and, the, lowland, regions, of, caraga, often, displacing, native, languages, in, those, areas, most, of, which, are, closely, related, to, the, language, while, tagalog, has, the, largest, number, of, native, speakers, among, the, languages, of, the, philippines, today, cebuano, had, the, largest, native, language, speaking, population, in, the, philippines, from, the, 1950s, until, about, the, 1980s, it, is, by, far, the, most, widely, spoken, of, the, bisayan, languages, cebuano, is, the, lingua, franca, of, central, visayas, the, western, parts, of, eastern, visayas, some, western, parts, of, palawan, and, most, parts, of, mindanao, the, name, cebuano, is, derived, from, the, island, of, cebu, which, is, the, source, of, standard, cebuano, cebuano, is, also, the, primary, language, in, western, leyte, noticeably, in, ormoc, cebuano, is, assigned, the, iso, 639, 2, three, letter, code, ceb, but, not, an, iso, 639, 1, two, letter, code, the, commission, on, the, filipino, language, the, philippine, government, body, charged, with, developing, and, promoting, the, national, and, regional, languages, of, the, country, spells, the, name, of, the, language, in, filipino, as, sebwano, the, term, cebuano, derives, from, cebu, ano, a, latinate, calque, reflecting, the, philippines, spanish, colonial, heritage, speakers, of, cebuano, in, cebu, and, even, those, from, outside, of, cebu, commonly, refer, to, the, language, as, bisay, the, name, cebuano, however, has, not, been, accepted, by, all, who, speak, it, cebuano, speakers, in, certain, portions, of, leyte, northern, mindanao, davao, region, caraga, and, zamboanga, peninsula, objected, to, the, name, of, the, language, and, claimed, that, their, ancestry, traces, back, to, bisay, speakers, native, to, their, place, and, not, from, immigrants, or, settlers, from, cebu, furthermore, they, refer, to, their, ethnicity, as, bisay, instead, of, cebuano, and, their, language, as, binisay, instead, of, cebuano, however, there, is, a, pushback, on, these, objections, some, language, enthusiasts, insist, on, referring, to, the, language, as, cebuano, because, as, they, claim, using, the, terms, bisay, and, binisay, to, refer, to, ethnicity, and, language, respectively, is, exclusivist, and, disenfranchises, the, speakers, of, the, hiligaynon, language, and, the, waray, language, who, also, refer, to, their, languages, as, binisay, to, distinguish, them, from, cebuano, bisay, existing, linguistic, studies, on, visayan, languages, most, notably, that, of, r, david, paul, zorc, has, described, the, language, spoken, in, cebu, negros, occidental, bohol, as, boholano, dialect, leyte, and, most, parts, of, mindanao, as, cebuano, zorc, s, studies, on, visayan, language, serves, as, the, bible, of, linguistics, in, the, study, of, visayan, languages, the, jesuit, linguist, and, a, native, of, cabadbaran, city, rodolfo, cabonce, s, j, published, two, dictionaries, during, his, stays, in, cagayan, de, oro, city, and, manolo, fortich, in, bukidnon, a, cebuano, english, dictionary, in, 1955, and, an, english, cebuano, dictionary, in, 1983, during, the, spanish, colonial, period, the, spaniards, broadly, referred, to, the, speakers, of, hiligaynon, cebuano, waray, kinaray, a, and, aklanon, as, visaya, and, made, no, distinctions, among, these, languages, as, of, the, 2020, but, released, in, 2023, statistics, released, by, the, philippine, statistics, authority, the, current, number, of, households, that, speak, cebuano, is, approximately, 1, 72, million, and, around, 6, 5, of, the, country, s, population, speak, it, inside, their, home, however, in, a, journal, published, in, 2020, the, number, of, speakers, is, estimated, to, be, 15, 9, million, which, in, turn, based, it, on, a, 2019, study, cebuano, is, spoken, in, the, provinces, of, cebu, bohol, siquijor, negros, oriental, northeastern, negros, occidental, as, well, as, the, municipality, of, hinoba, an, and, the, cities, of, kabankalan, and, sipalay, to, a, great, extent, alongside, ilonggo, southern, masbate, western, portions, of, leyte, and, biliran, to, a, great, extent, alongside, waray, and, a, large, portion, of, mindanao, notably, the, urban, areas, of, zamboanga, peninsula, northern, mindanao, davao, region, caraga, and, some, parts, of, soccsksargen, alongside, ilonggo, maguindanaon, indigenous, mindanaoan, languages, and, to, the, lesser, extent, ilocano, it, is, also, spoken, in, some, remote, barangays, of, san, francisco, and, san, andres, in, quezon, province, in, luzon, due, to, its, geographical, contact, with, cebuano, speaking, parts, of, burias, island, in, masbate, some, dialects, of, cebuano, have, different, names, for, the, language, cebuano, speakers, from, cebu, are, mainly, called, cebuano, while, those, from, bohol, are, boholano, or, bol, anon, cebuano, speakers, in, leyte, identify, their, dialect, as, kan, meaning, that, leyte, cebuano, or, leyte, o, speakers, in, mindanao, and, luzon, refer, to, the, language, simply, as, binisay, or, bisay, the, cebuano, language, is, a, descendant, of, the, hypothesized, reconstructed, proto, philippine, language, which, in, turn, descended, from, proto, malayo, polynesian, making, it, distantly, related, to, many, languages, in, maritime, southeast, asia, including, indonesian, and, malay, the, earlier, forms, of, the, language, is, hard, to, trace, as, a, result, of, lack, of, documents, written, using, the, language, through, different, time, periods, and, also, because, the, natives, used, to, write, on, easily, perishable, material, rather, than, on, processed, paper, or, parchment, the, earliest, record, of, the, cebuano, language, was, first, documented, in, a, list, of, words, compiled, by, antonio, pigafetta, an, italian, explorer, who, was, part, of, ferdinand, magellan, s, 1521, expedition, while, there, is, evidence, of, a, writing, system, for, the, language, its, use, appears, to, have, been, sporadic, spaniards, recorded, the, visayan, script, which, was, called, kudlit, kabadlit, by, the, natives, although, spanish, chroniclers, francisco, alcina, and, antonio, de, morga, wrote, that, almost, every, native, was, literate, in, the, 17th, century, ce, it, appears, to, have, been, exaggerated, as, accounted, for, lack, of, physical, evidence, and, contradicting, reports, of, different, accounts, a, report, from, 1567, ce, describes, how, the, natives, wrote, the, language, and, stated, that, the, natives, learned, it, from, the, malays, but, a, century, later, another, report, claimed, that, the, visayan, natives, learned, it, from, the, tagalogs, despite, the, confirmation, of, the, usage, of, baybayin, in, the, region, the, documents, of, the, language, being, written, in, it, other, than, latin, between, the, 17th, century, ce, and, 18th, century, ce, are, now, rare, in, the, 18th, century, ce, francisco, encina, a, spanish, priest, compiled, a, grammar, book, on, the, language, but, his, work, was, published, sometime, only, by, the, early, 19th, century, ce, the, priest, recorded, the, letters, of, the, latin, alphabet, used, for, the, language, and, in, a, separate, report, his, name, was, listed, as, the, recorder, of, the, non, latin, characters, used, by, the, natives, cebuano, written, literature, is, generally, agreed, to, have, started, with, vicente, yap, sotto, who, wrote, maming, in, 1901, but, earlier, he, wrote, a, more, patriotic, piece, of, literature, that, was, published, a, year, later, after, maming, because, of, american, censorship, during, the, us, occupation, of, the, philippines, however, there, existed, a, piece, that, was, more, of, a, conduct, book, rather, than, a, fully, defined, story, itself, written, in, 1852, by, fray, antonio, ubeda, de, la, sant, sima, trinidad, below, is, the, vowel, system, of, cebuano, with, their, corresponding, letter, representation, in, angular, brackets, sometimes, a, may, also, be, pronounced, as, the, open, mid, back, unrounded, vowel, as, in, english, g, u, t, e, or, i, as, the, near, close, near, front, unrounded, vowel, as, in, english, b, i, t, and, o, or, u, as, the, open, mid, back, rounded, vowel, as, in, english, th, ou, ght, or, the, near, close, near, back, rounded, vowel, as, in, english, h, oo, k, during, the, precolonial, and, spanish, period, cebuano, had, only, three, vowel, phonemes, a, i, and, u, this, was, later, expanded, to, five, vowels, with, the, introduction, of, spanish, as, a, consequence, the, vowels, o, or, u, as, well, as, e, or, i, are, still, mostly, allophones, they, can, be, freely, switched, with, each, other, without, losing, their, meaning, free, variation, though, it, may, sound, strange, to, a, native, listener, depending, on, their, dialect, the, vowel, a, has, no, variations, though, it, can, be, pronounced, subtly, differently, as, either, a, or, and, very, rarely, as, immediately, after, the, consonant, w, loanwords, however, are, usually, more, conservative, in, their, orthography, and, pronunciation, e, g, dyip, jeepney, from, english, jeep, will, never, be, written, or, spoken, as, dyep, there, are, only, four, diphthongs, since, o, and, u, are, allophones, these, include, aj, uj, aw, and, iw, for, cebuano, consonants, all, the, stops, are, unaspirated, the, velar, nasal, occurs, in, all, positions, including, at, the, beginning, of, a, word, e, g, ngano, why, the, glottal, stop, is, most, commonly, encountered, in, between, two, vowels, but, can, also, appear, in, all, positions, like, in, tagalog, glottal, stops, are, usually, not, indicated, in, writing, when, indicated, it, is, commonly, written, as, a, hyphen, or, an, apostrophe, if, the, glottal, stop, occurs, in, the, middle, of, the, word, e, g, tu, o, or, tu, o, right, more, formally, when, it, occurs, at, the, end, of, the, word, it, is, indicated, by, a, circumflex, accent, if, both, a, stress, and, a, glottal, stop, occurs, at, the, final, vowel, e, g, bas, wet, or, a, grave, accent, if, the, glottal, stop, occurs, at, the, final, vowel, but, the, stress, occurs, at, the, penultimate, syllable, e, g, bat, child, below, is, a, chart, of, cebuano, consonants, with, their, corresponding, letter, representation, in, parentheses, in, certain, dialects, l, l, may, be, interchanged, with, w, w, in, between, vowels, and, vice, versa, depending, on, the, following, conditions, a, final, l, can, also, be, replaced, with, w, in, certain, areas, in, bohol, e, g, tambal, medicine, becomes, tambaw, in, very, rare, cases, in, cebu, l, may, also, be, replaced, with, y, in, between, the, vowels, a, and, e, i, e, g, tingali, maybe, becomes, tingayi, in, some, parts, of, bohol, and, southern, leyte, j, y, is, also, often, replaced, with, d, j, dy, when, it, is, in, the, beginning, of, a, syllable, e, g, kalayo, fire, becomes, kalajo, it, can, also, happen, even, if, the, y, is, at, the, final, position, of, the, syllable, and, the, word, but, only, if, it, is, moved, to, the, initial, position, by, the, addition, of, the, affix, a, for, example, baboy, pig, can, not, become, baboj, but, baboya, can, become, baboja, all, of, the, above, substitutions, are, considered, allophonic, and, do, not, change, the, meaning, of, the, word, in, rarer, instances, the, consonant, d, might, also, be, replaced, with, r, when, it, is, in, between, two, vowels, e, g, boholano, id, for, standard, cebuano, ir, dog, but, d, and, r, are, not, considered, allophones, though, they, may, have, been, in, the, past, stress, accent, is, phonemic, which, means, that, words, with, different, accent, placements, such, as, dap, t, near, and, d, pit, place, are, considered, separate, the, stress, is, predictably, on, the, penult, when, the, second, to, last, syllable, is, closed, cvc, or, vc, on, the, other, hand, when, the, syllable, is, open, cv, or, v, the, stress, can, be, on, either, the, penultimate, or, the, final, syllable, although, there, are, certain, grammatical, conditions, or, categories, under, which, the, stress, is, predictable, such, as, with, numbers, and, pronouns, the, cebuano, language, is, written, using, the, latin, script, and, the, de, facto, writing, convention, is, based, on, the, filipino, orthography, there, is, no, updated, spelling, rule, of, the, language, as, the, letter, ee, is, often, interchangeable, with, ii, and, oo, with, uu, though, it, was, recorded, that, the, language, used, a, different, writing, system, prior, to, the, introduction, of, the, latin, script, its, use, was, so, rare, that, there, is, hardly, any, surviving, accounts, of, cebuano, being, written, in, what, was, called, badlit, modern, cebuano, uses, 20, letters, from, the, latin, alphabet, and, it, consists, of, 5, vowels, and, 15, consonants, the, letters, c, f, j, q, v, x, and, z, are, also, used, but, in, foreign, loanwords, while, the, is, used, for, spanish, names, e, g, santo, ni, o, the, ng, digraph, is, also, present, in, the, alphabet, since, it, is, part, of, the, phonology, of, most, philippine, languages, representing, the, sound, of, the, velar, nasal, e, g, ngipon, teeth, and, ngano, why, cebuano, shares, many, cognates, with, other, austronesian, languages, and, its, descendants, early, trade, contact, resulted, in, the, adoption, of, loanwords, from, malay, despite, belonging, in, the, same, language, family, like, sul, t, to, write, pilak, silver, and, bal, sa, anxious, it, also, adopted, words, from, sanskrit, like, bahand, wealth, goods, riches, from, bh, nda, goods, and, b, sa, to, read, is, taken, from, v, c, sacred, text, and, arabic, like, the, word, alam, to, know, is, said, to, be, borrowed, from, arabic, lam, things, creation, existing, before, and, salamat, expression, of, gratitude, thanks, thank, you, from, sal, m, t, plural, form, of, sal, ma, meaning, good, health, both, of, which, were, indirectly, transmitted, to, cebuano, through, malays, the, biggest, component, of, loanwords, that, cebuano, uses, is, from, spanish, being, more, culturally, influenced, by, spanish, priests, from, the, late, 16th, century, and, invigorated, by, the, opening, of, the, suez, canal, in, the, 1860s, that, encouraged, european, migrations, to, asia, most, notably, its, numeral, system, english, words, are, also, used, extensively, in, the, language, and, mostly, among, the, educated, ones, even, sometimes, using, the, english, word, rather, than, the, direct, cebuano, for, example, instead, of, saying, magpal, t, to, buy, in, future, tense, speakers, would, often, say, mag, buy, currently, the, native, system, is, mostly, used, as, cardinal, numbers, and, more, often, as, ordinal, numbers, and, the, spanish, derived, system, is, used, in, monetary, and, chronological, terminology, and, is, also, commonly, used, in, counting, from, 11, and, above, though, both, systems, can, be, used, interchangeably, regardless, the, table, below, shows, the, comparison, of, native, numerals, and, spanish, derived, numerals, but, observably, cebuano, speakers, would, often, just, use, the, english, numeral, system, instead, especially, for, numbers, more, than, 100, the, language, uses, a, base, 10, numeral, system, thence, the, sets, of, ten, are, ultimately, derived, from, the, unit, except, the, first, ten, which, is, napul, this, is, done, by, adding, a, prefix, ka, then, followed, by, a, unit, and, then, the, suffix, an, for, example, 20, is, spoken, as, ka, duh, an, lit, the, second, set, of, ten, the, numbers, are, named, from, 1, 10, for, values, after, 10, it, is, spoken, as, a, ten, and, a, unit, for, example, 11, is, spoken, as, napul, ug, us, shortened, to, napul, g, us, lit, ten, and, one, 111, is, spoken, as, usa, ka, gat, s, napul, ug, us, and, 1111, is, spoken, as, us, ka, libo, us, ka, gat, s, napul, ug, us, the, ordinal, counting, uses, the, prefix, ika, and, then, the, unit, except, for, first, which, is, una, for, example, ika, duh, means, second, below, is, the, official, translation, of, article, 1, of, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, taken, from, the, official, united, nations, website,

cebuano, regardless, of, how, it, is, actually, spoken, by, the, speaker, for, example, bal, y, house, is, pronounced, ba, l, a, in, standard, cebuano, and, is, thus, spelled, bal, y, even, in, urban, cebuano, where, it, is, actually, pronounced, ba, cebuano, is, spoken, natively, over, a, large, area, of, the, philippines, and, thus, has, numerous, regional, dialects, it, can, vary, significantly, in, terms, of, lexicon, and, phonology, depending, on, where, it, is, spoken, increasing, usage, of, spoken, english, being, the, primary, language, of, commerce, and, education, in, the, philippines, has, also, led, to, the, introduction, of, new, pronunciations, and, spellings, of, old, cebuano, words, code, switching, forms, of, english, and, bisaya, bislish, are, also, common, among, the, educated, younger, generations, there, are, four, main, dialectal, groups, within, cebuano, aside, from, standard, cebuano, and, urban, cebuano, they, are, as, follows, the, boholano, dialect, of, bohol, shares, many, similarities, with, the, southern, form, of, standard, cebuano, it, is, also, spoken, in, some, parts, of, siquijor, and, parts, of, northern, mindanao, boholano, especially, as, spoken, in, central, bohol, can, be, distinguished, from, other, cebuano, variants, by, a, few, phonetic, changes, southern, kan, is, a, dialect, of, both, southern, leyte, and, southern, leyte, provinces, it, is, closest, to, the, mindanao, cebuano, dialect, at, the, southern, area, and, northern, cebu, dialect, at, the, northern, boundaries, both, north, and, south, kana, are, subgroups, of, leyte, o, dialect, both, of, these, dialects, are, spoken, in, western, and, central, leyte, and, in, the, southern, province, but, boholano, is, more, concentrated, in, maasin, city, northern, kan, found, in, the, northern, part, of, leyte, is, closest, to, the, variety, of, the, language, spoken, in, northern, part, of, leyte, and, shows, significant, influence, from, waray, waray, quite, notably, in, its, pace, which, speakers, from, cebu, find, very, fast, and, its, more, mellow, tone, compared, to, the, urban, cebu, city, dialect, which, kana, speakers, find, rough, a, distinguishing, feature, of, this, dialect, is, the, reduction, of, a, prominent, but, an, often, unnoticed, feature, of, this, dialect, is, the, labialisation, of, n, and, into, m, when, these, phonemes, come, before, p, b, and, m, velarisation, of, m, and, n, into, before, k, and, and, the, dentalisation, of, and, m, into, n, before, t, d, and, n, and, sometimes, before, vowels, and, other, consonants, as, well, this, is, the, variety, of, cebuano, spoken, throughout, most, of, mindanao, and, it, is, the, standard, dialect, of, cebuano, in, northern, mindanao, a, branch, of, mindanaoan, cebuano, in, davao, is, also, known, as, davaoe, o, not, to, be, confused, with, the, davao, variant, of, chavacano, which, is, called, castellano, abakay, like, the, cebuano, of, luzon, it, contains, some, tagalog, vocabulary, which, speakers, may, use, even, more, frequently, than, in, luzon, cebuano, its, grammar, is, similar, to, that, of, other, varieties, however, current, speakers, exhibit, uniquely, strong, tagalog, influence, in, their, speech, by, substituting, most, cebuano, words, with, tagalog, ones, this, is, because, the, older, generations, speak, tagalog, to, their, children, in, home, settings, and, cebuano, is, spoken, in, other, everyday, settings, making, tagalog, the, secondary, lingua, franca, one, characteristic, of, this, dialect, is, the, practice, of, saying, at, derived, from, tagalog, yat, to, denote, uncertainty, in, a, speaker, s, aforementioned, statements, for, instance, a, davaoe, o, might, say, tu, man, at, sa, bal, y, si, manuel, instead, of, tu, man, ting, li, sa, bal, y, si, manuel, the, word, at, does, exist, in, cebuano, though, it, means, squid, ink, in, contrast, to, tagalog, e, g, at, sa, nukos, other, examples, include, nibab, ko, sa, jeep, sa, kanto, tapos, niul, ko, sa, among, bal, y, i, got, off, the, jeepney, at, the, street, corner, and, then, i, went, home, instead, of, ninaog, ko, sa, jeep, sa, eskina, dayon, niul, ko, sa, among, bal, y, the, words, bab, and, naog, mean, to, disembark, or, to, go, down, kanto, and, eskina, mean, street, corner, while, tapos, and, dayon, mean, then, in, these, cases, the, former, word, is, tagalog, and, the, latter, is, cebuano, davaoe, o, speakers, may, also, sometimes, add, bagobo, or, mansakan, vocabulary, to, their, speech, as, in, madayawng, adlaw, amigo, kumusta, ka, good, day, friend, how, are, you, literally, good, morning, afternoon, rather, than, maayong, adlaw, amigo, kumusta, ka, the, words, madayaw, and, maayo, both, mean, good, though, the, former, is, bagobo, and, the, latter, cebuano, one, of, the, famous, characteristics, of, this, dialect, is, disregarding, the, agreement, between, the, verb, to, go, adto, anha, anhi, ari, and, locative, demonstratives, didto, dinha, dinhi, diri, or, the, distance, of, the, object, place, in, cebu, cebuano, dialect, when, the, verb, to, go, is, distal, far, from, both, the, speaker, and, the, listener, the, locative,
