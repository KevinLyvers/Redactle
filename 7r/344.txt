translation, is, the, communication, of, the, meaning, of, a, source, language, text, by, means, of, an, equivalent, target, language, text, the, english, language, draws, a, terminological, distinction, which, does, not, exist, in, every, language, between, translating, a, written, text, and, interpreting, oral, or, signed, communication, between, users, of, different, languages, under, this, distinction, translation, can, begin, only, after, the, appearance, of, writing, within, a, language, community, a, translator, always, risks, inadvertently, introducing, source, language, words, grammar, or, syntax, into, the, target, language, rendering, on, the, other, hand, such, spill, overs, have, sometimes, imported, useful, source, language, calques, and, loanwords, that, have, enriched, target, languages, translators, including, early, translators, of, sacred, texts, have, helped, shape, the, very, languages, into, which, they, have, translated, because, of, the, laboriousness, of, the, translation, process, since, the, 1940s, efforts, have, been, made, with, varying, degrees, of, success, to, automate, translation, or, to, mechanically, aid, the, human, translator, more, recently, the, rise, of, the, internet, has, fostered, a, world, wide, market, for, translation, services, and, has, facilitated, language, localisation, the, english, word, translation, derives, from, the, latin, word, translatio, which, comes, from, trans, across, ferre, to, carry, or, to, bring, latio, in, turn, coming, from, latus, the, past, participle, of, ferre, thus, translatio, is, a, carrying, across, or, a, bringing, across, in, this, case, of, a, text, from, one, language, to, another, some, slavic, languages, and, the, germanic, languages, other, than, dutch, and, afrikaans, have, calqued, their, words, for, the, concept, of, translation, on, translatio, substituting, their, respective, slavic, or, germanic, root, words, for, the, latin, roots, the, remaining, slavic, languages, instead, calqued, their, words, for, translation, from, an, alternative, latin, word, tr, ducti, itself, derived, from, tr, d, c, to, lead, across, or, to, bring, across, from, trans, across, d, c, to, lead, or, to, bring, the, west, and, east, slavic, languages, except, for, russian, adopted, the, transl, ti, pattern, whereas, russian, and, the, south, slavic, languages, adopted, the, tr, ducti, pattern, the, romance, languages, deriving, directly, from, latin, did, not, need, to, calque, their, equivalent, words, for, translation, instead, they, simply, adapted, the, second, of, the, two, alternative, latin, words, tr, ducti, the, ancient, greek, term, for, translation, metaphrasis, a, speaking, across, has, supplied, english, with, metaphrase, a, literal, or, word, for, word, translation, as, contrasted, with, paraphrase, a, saying, in, other, words, from, paraphrasis, metaphrase, corresponds, in, one, of, the, more, recent, terminologies, to, formal, equivalence, and, paraphrase, to, dynamic, equivalence, strictly, speaking, the, concept, of, metaphrase, of, word, for, word, translation, is, an, imperfect, concept, because, a, given, word, in, a, given, language, often, carries, more, than, one, meaning, and, because, a, similar, given, meaning, may, often, be, represented, in, a, given, language, by, more, than, one, word, nevertheless, metaphrase, and, paraphrase, may, be, useful, as, ideal, concepts, that, mark, the, extremes, in, the, spectrum, of, possible, approaches, to, translation, discussions, of, the, theory, and, practice, of, translation, reach, back, into, antiquity, and, show, remarkable, continuities, the, ancient, greeks, distinguished, between, metaphrase, literal, translation, and, paraphrase, this, distinction, was, adopted, by, english, poet, and, translator, john, dryden, 1631, 1700, who, described, translation, as, the, judicious, blending, of, these, two, modes, of, phrasing, when, selecting, in, the, target, language, counterparts, or, equivalents, for, the, expressions, used, in, the, source, language, when, appear, literally, graceful, it, were, an, injury, to, the, author, that, they, should, be, changed, but, since, what, is, beautiful, in, one, is, often, barbarous, nay, sometimes, nonsense, in, another, it, would, be, unreasonable, to, limit, a, translator, to, the, narrow, compass, of, his, author, s, words, tis, enough, if, he, choose, out, some, expression, which, does, not, vitiate, the, sense, dryden, cautioned, however, against, the, license, of, imitation, i, e, of, adapted, translation, when, a, painter, copies, from, the, life, he, has, no, privilege, to, alter, features, and, lineaments, this, general, formulation, of, the, central, concept, of, translation, equivalence, is, as, adequate, as, any, that, has, been, proposed, since, cicero, and, horace, who, in, 1st, century, bce, rome, famously, and, literally, cautioned, against, translating, word, for, word, verbum, pro, verbo, despite, occasional, theoretical, diversity, the, actual, practice, of, translation, has, hardly, changed, since, antiquity, except, for, some, extreme, metaphrasers, in, the, early, christian, period, and, the, middle, ages, and, adapters, in, various, periods, especially, pre, classical, rome, and, the, 18th, century, translators, have, generally, shown, prudent, flexibility, in, seeking, equivalents, literal, where, possible, paraphrastic, where, necessary, for, the, original, meaning, and, other, crucial, values, e, g, style, verse, form, concordance, with, musical, accompaniment, or, in, films, with, speech, articulatory, movements, as, determined, from, context, in, general, translators, have, sought, to, preserve, the, context, itself, by, reproducing, the, original, order, of, sememes, and, hence, word, order, when, necessary, reinterpreting, the, actual, grammatical, structure, for, example, by, shifting, from, active, to, passive, voice, or, vice, versa, the, grammatical, differences, between, fixed, word, order, languages, e, g, english, french, german, and, free, word, order, languages, e, g, greek, latin, polish, russian, have, been, no, impediment, in, this, regard, the, particular, syntax, sentence, structure, characteristics, of, a, text, s, source, language, are, adjusted, to, the, syntactic, requirements, of, the, target, language, when, a, target, language, has, lacked, terms, that, are, found, in, a, source, language, translators, have, borrowed, those, terms, thereby, enriching, the, target, language, thanks, in, great, measure, to, the, exchange, of, calques, and, loanwords, between, languages, and, to, their, importation, from, other, languages, there, are, few, concepts, that, are, untranslatable, among, the, modern, european, languages, a, greater, problem, however, is, translating, terms, relating, to, cultural, concepts, that, have, no, equivalent, in, the, target, language, for, full, comprehension, such, situations, require, the, provision, of, a, gloss, generally, the, greater, the, contact, and, exchange, that, have, existed, between, two, languages, or, between, those, languages, and, a, third, one, the, greater, is, the, ratio, of, metaphrase, to, paraphrase, that, may, be, used, in, translating, among, them, however, due, to, shifts, in, ecological, niches, of, words, a, common, etymology, is, sometimes, misleading, as, a, guide, to, current, meaning, in, one, or, the, other, language, for, example, the, english, actual, should, not, be, confused, with, the, cognate, french, actuel, present, current, the, polish, aktualny, present, current, topical, timely, feasible, the, swedish, aktuell, topical, presently, of, importance, the, russian, urgent, topical, or, the, dutch, actueel, current, the, translator, s, role, as, a, bridge, for, carrying, across, values, between, cultures, has, been, discussed, at, least, since, terence, the, 2nd, century, bce, roman, adapter, of, greek, comedies, the, translator, s, role, is, however, by, no, means, a, passive, mechanical, one, and, so, has, also, been, compared, to, that, of, an, artist, the, main, ground, seems, to, be, the, concept, of, parallel, creation, found, in, critics, such, as, cicero, dryden, observed, that, translation, is, a, type, of, drawing, after, life, comparison, of, the, translator, with, a, musician, or, actor, goes, back, at, least, to, samuel, johnson, s, remark, about, alexander, pope, playing, homer, on, a, flageolet, while, homer, himself, used, a, bassoon, in, the, 13th, century, roger, bacon, wrote, that, if, a, translation, is, to, be, true, the, translator, must, know, both, languages, as, well, as, the, science, that, he, is, to, translate, and, finding, that, few, translators, did, he, wanted, to, do, away, with, translation, and, translators, altogether, the, translator, of, the, bible, into, german, martin, luther, 1483, 1546, is, credited, with, being, the, first, european, to, posit, that, one, translates, satisfactorily, only, toward, his, own, language, l, g, kelly, states, that, since, johann, gottfried, herder, in, the, 18th, century, it, has, been, axiomatic, that, one, translates, only, toward, his, own, language, compounding, the, demands, on, the, translator, is, the, fact, that, no, dictionary, or, thesaurus, can, ever, be, a, fully, adequate, guide, in, translating, the, scottish, historian, alexander, tytler, in, his, essay, on, the, principles, of, translation, 1790, emphasized, that, assiduous, reading, is, a, more, comprehensive, guide, to, a, language, than, are, dictionaries, the, same, point, but, also, including, listening, to, the, spoken, language, had, earlier, in, 1783, been, made, by, the, polish, poet, and, grammarian, onufry, kopczy, ski, the, translator, s, special, role, in, society, is, described, in, a, posthumous, 1803, essay, by, poland, s, la, fontaine, the, roman, catholic, primate, of, poland, poet, encyclopedist, author, of, the, first, polish, novel, and, translator, from, french, and, greek, ignacy, krasicki, ranslation, is, in, fact, an, art, both, estimable, and, very, difficult, and, therefore, is, not, the, labor, and, portion, of, common, minds, should, be, by, those, who, are, themselves, capable, of, being, actors, when, they, see, greater, use, in, translating, the, works, of, others, than, in, their, own, works, and, hold, higher, than, their, own, glory, the, service, that, they, render, their, country, due, to, western, colonialism, and, cultural, dominance, in, recent, centuries, western, translation, traditions, have, largely, replaced, other, traditions, the, western, traditions, draw, on, both, ancient, and, medieval, traditions, and, on, more, recent, european, innovations, though, earlier, approaches, to, translation, are, less, commonly, used, today, they, retain, importance, when, dealing, with, their, products, as, when, historians, view, ancient, or, medieval, records, to, piece, together, events, which, took, place, in, non, western, or, pre, western, environments, also, though, heavily, influenced, by, western, traditions, and, practiced, by, translators, taught, in, western, style, educational, systems, chinese, and, related, translation, traditions, retain, some, theories, and, philosophies, unique, to, the, chinese, tradition, traditions, of, translating, material, among, the, languages, of, ancient, egypt, mesopotamia, assyria, syriac, language, anatolia, and, israel, hebrew, language, go, back, several, millennia, there, exist, partial, translations, of, the, sumerian, epic, of, gilgamesh, c, 2000, bce, into, southwest, asian, languages, of, the, second, millennium, bce, an, early, example, of, a, bilingual, document, is, the, 1274, bce, treaty, of, kadesh, between, the, ancient, egyptian, and, hittie, empires, the, babylonians, were, the, first, to, establish, translation, as, a, profession, the, first, translations, of, greek, and, coptic, texts, into, arabic, possibly, indirectly, from, syriac, translations, seem, to, have, been, undertaken, as, early, as, the, late, seventh, century, ce, the, second, abbasid, caliph, funded, a, translation, bureau, in, baghdad, in, the, eighth, century, bayt, al, hikma, the, famous, library, in, baghdad, was, generously, endowed, and, the, collection, included, books, in, many, languages, and, it, became, a, leading, centre, for, the, translation, of, works, from, antiquity, into, arabic, with, its, own, translation, department, translations, into, european, languages, from, arabic, versions, of, lost, greek, and, roman, texts, began, in, the, middle, of, the, eleventh, century, when, the, benefits, to, be, gained, from, the, arabs, knowledge, of, the, classical, texts, were, recognised, by, european, scholars, particularly, after, the, establishment, of, the, escuela, de, traductores, de, toledo, in, spain, william, caxton, s, dictes, or, sayengis, of, the, philosophres, sayings, of, the, philosophers, 1477, was, a, translation, into, english, of, an, eleventh, century, egyptian, text, which, reached, english, via, translation, into, latin, and, then, french, the, translation, of, foreign, works, for, publishing, in, arabic, was, revived, by, the, establishment, of, the, madrasat, al, alsun, school, of, tongues, in, egypt, in, 1813, there, is, a, separate, tradition, of, translation, in, south, southeast, and, east, asia, primarily, of, texts, from, the, indian, and, chinese, civilizations, connected, especially, with, the, rendering, of, religious, particularly, buddhist, texts, and, with, the, governance, of, the, chinese, empire, classical, indian, translation, is, characterized, by, loose, adaptation, rather, than, the, closer, translation, more, commonly, found, in, europe, and, chinese, translation, theory, identifies, various, criteria, and, limitations, in, translation, in, the, east, asian, sphere, of, chinese, cultural, influence, more, important, than, translation, per, se, has, been, the, use, and, reading, of, chinese, texts, which, also, had, substantial, influence, on, the, japanese, korean, and, vietnamese, languages, with, substantial, borrowings, of, chinese, vocabulary, and, writing, system, notable, is, the, japanese, kanbun, a, system, for, glossing, chinese, texts, for, japanese, speakers, though, indianized, states, in, southeast, asia, often, translated, sanskrit, material, into, the, local, languages, the, literate, elites, and, scribes, more, commonly, used, sanskrit, as, their, primary, language, of, culture, and, government, some, special, aspects, of, translating, from, chinese, are, illustrated, in, perry, link, s, discussion, of, translating, the, work, of, the, tang, dynasty, poet, wang, wei, 699, 759, ce, some, of, the, art, of, classical, chinese, poetry, must, simply, be, set, aside, as, untranslatable, the, internal, structure, of, chinese, characters, has, a, beauty, of, its, own, and, the, calligraphy, in, which, classical, poems, were, written, is, another, important, but, untranslatable, dimension, since, chinese, characters, do, not, vary, in, length, and, because, there, are, exactly, five, characters, per, line, in, a, poem, like, another, untranslatable, feature, is, that, the, written, result, hung, on, a, wall, presents, a, rectangle, translators, into, languages, whose, word, lengths, vary, can, reproduce, such, an, effect, only, at, the, risk, of, fatal, awkwardness, another, imponderable, is, how, to, imitate, the, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, rhythm, in, which, five, syllable, lines, in, classical, chinese, poems, normally, are, read, chinese, characters, are, pronounced, in, one, syllable, apiece, so, producing, such, rhythms, in, chinese, is, not, hard, and, the, results, are, unobtrusive, but, any, imitation, in, a, western, language, is, almost, inevitably, stilted, and, distracting, even, less, translatable, are, the, patterns, of, tone, arrangement, in, classical, chinese, poetry, each, syllable, character, belongs, to, one, of, two, categories, determined, by, the, pitch, contour, in, which, it, is, read, in, a, classical, chinese, poem, the, patterns, of, alternation, of, the, two, categories, exhibit, parallelism, and, mirroring, once, the, untranslatables, have, been, set, aside, the, problems, for, a, translator, especially, of, chinese, poetry, are, two, what, does, the, translator, think, the, poetic, line, says, and, once, he, thinks, he, understands, it, how, can, he, render, it, into, the, target, language, most, of, the, difficulties, according, to, link, arise, in, addressing, the, second, problem, where, the, impossibility, of, perfect, answers, spawns, endless, debate, almost, always, at, the, center, is, the, letter, versus, spirit, dilemma, at, the, literalist, extreme, efforts, are, made, to, dissect, every, conceivable, detail, about, the, language, of, the, original, chinese, poem, the, dissection, though, writes, link, normally, does, to, the, art, of, a, poem, approximately, what, the, scalpel, of, an, anatomy, instructor, does, to, the, life, of, a, frog, chinese, characters, in, avoiding, grammatical, specificity, offer, advantages, to, poets, and, simultaneously, challenges, to, poetry, translators, that, are, associated, primarily, with, absences, of, subject, number, and, tense, it, is, the, norm, in, classical, chinese, poetry, and, common, even, in, modern, chinese, prose, to, omit, subjects, the, reader, or, listener, infers, a, subject, the, grammars, of, some, western, languages, however, require, that, a, subject, be, stated, although, this, is, often, avoided, by, using, a, passive, or, impersonal, construction, most, of, the, translators, cited, in, eliot, weinberger, s, 19, ways, of, looking, at, wang, wei, supply, a, subject, weinberger, points, out, however, that, when, an, i, as, a, subject, is, inserted, a, controlling, individual, mind, of, the, poet, enters, and, destroys, the, effect, of, the, chinese, line, without, a, subject, he, writes, the, experience, becomes, both, universal, and, immediate, to, the, reader, another, approach, to, the, subjectlessness, is, to, use, the, target, language, s, passive, voice, but, this, again, particularizes, the, experience, too, much, nouns, have, no, number, in, chinese, if, writes, link, you, want, to, talk, in, chinese, about, one, rose, you, may, but, then, you, use, a, measure, word, to, say, one, blossom, of, roseness, chinese, verbs, are, tense, less, there, are, several, ways, to, specify, when, something, happened, or, will, happen, but, verb, tense, is, not, one, of, them, for, poets, this, creates, the, great, advantage, of, ambiguity, according, to, link, weinberger, s, insight, about, subjectlessness, that, it, produces, an, effect, both, universal, and, immediate, applies, to, timelessness, as, well, link, proposes, a, kind, of, uncertainty, principle, that, may, be, applicable, not, only, to, translation, from, the, chinese, language, but, to, all, translation, dilemmas, about, translation, do, not, have, definitive, right, answers, although, there, can, be, unambiguously, wrong, ones, if, misreadings, of, the, original, are, involved, any, translation, except, machine, translation, a, different, case, must, pass, through, the, mind, of, a, translator, and, that, mind, inevitably, contains, its, own, store, of, perceptions, memories, and, values, weinberger, pushes, this, insight, further, when, he, writes, that, every, reading, of, every, poem, regardless, of, language, is, an, act, of, translation, translation, into, the, reader, s, intellectual, and, emotional, life, then, he, goes, still, further, because, a, reader, s, mental, life, shifts, over, time, there, is, a, sense, in, which, the, same, poem, cannot, be, read, twice, translation, of, material, into, arabic, expanded, after, the, creation, of, arabic, script, in, the, 5th, century, and, gained, great, importance, with, the, rise, of, islam, and, islamic, empires, arab, translation, initially, focused, primarily, on, politics, rendering, persian, greek, even, chinese, and, indic, diplomatic, materials, into, arabic, it, later, focused, on, translating, classical, greek, and, persian, works, as, well, as, some, chinese, and, indian, texts, into, arabic, for, scholarly, study, at, major, islamic, learning, centers, such, as, the, al, karaouine, fes, morocco, al, azhar, cairo, egypt, and, the, al, nizamiyya, of, baghdad, in, terms, of, theory, arabic, translation, drew, heavily, on, earlier, near, eastern, traditions, as, well, as, more, contemporary, greek, and, persian, traditions, arabic, translation, efforts, and, techniques, are, important, to, western, translation, traditions, due, to, centuries, of, close, contacts, and, exchanges, especially, after, the, renaissance, europeans, began, more, intensive, study, of, arabic, and, persian, translations, of, classical, works, as, well, as, scientific, and, philosophical, works, of, arab, and, oriental, origins, arabic, and, to, a, lesser, degree, persian, became, important, sources, of, material, and, perhaps, of, techniques, for, revitalized, western, traditions, which, in, time, would, overtake, the, islamic, and, oriental, traditions, in, the, 19th, century, after, the, middle, east, s, islamic, clerics, and, copyists, had, conceded, defeat, in, their,

be, on, this, consideration, that, what, was, beautiful, in, the, greek, or, latin, would, not, appear, so, shining, in, the, english, and, where, i, have, enlarg, d, them, i, desire, the, false, criticks, would, not, always, think, that, those, thoughts, are, wholly, mine, but, that, either, they, are, secretly, in, the, poet, or, may, be, fairly, deduc, d, from, him, or, at, least, if, both, those, considerations, should, fail, that, my, own, is, of, a, piece, with, his, and, that, if, he, were, living, and, an, englishman, they, are, such, as, he, wou, d, probably, have, written, a, translation, that, meets, the, criterion, of, fidelity, faithfulness, is, said, to, be, faithful, a, translation, that, meets, the, criterion, of, transparency, idiomatic, depending, on, the, given, translation, the, two, qualities, may, not, be, mutually, exclusive, the, criteria, for, judging, the, fidelity, of, a, translation, vary, according, to, the, subject, type, and, use, of, the, text, its, literary, qualities, its, social, or, historical, context, etc, the, criteria, for, judging, the, transparency, of, a, translation, appear, more, straightforward, an, unidiomatic, translation, sounds, wrong, and, in, extreme, cases, of, word, for, word, translation, often, results, in, patent, nonsense, nevertheless, in, certain, contexts, a, translator, may, consciously, seek, to, produce, a, literal, translation, translators, of, literary, religious, or, historic, texts, often, adhere, as, closely, as, possible, to, the, source, text, stretching, the, limits, of, the, target, language, to, produce, an, unidiomatic, text, also, a, translator, may, adopt, expressions, from, the, source, language, in, order, to, provide, local, color, while, current, western, translation, practice, is, dominated, by, the, dual, concepts, of, fidelity, and, transparency, this, has, not, always, been, the, case, there, have, been, periods, especially, in, pre, classical, rome, and, in, the, 18th, century, when, many, translators, stepped, beyond, the, bounds, of, translation, proper, into, the, realm, of, adaptation, adapted, translation, retains, currency, in, some, non, western, traditions, the, indian, epic, the, ramayana, appears, in, many, versions, in, the, various, indian, languages, and, the, stories, are, different, in, each, similar, examples, are, to, be, found, in, medieval, christian, literature, which, adjusted, the, text, to, local, customs, and, mores, many, non, transparent, translation, theories, draw, on, concepts, from, german, romanticism, the, most, obvious, influence, being, the, german, theologian, and, philosopher, friedrich, schleiermacher, in, his, seminal, lecture, on, the, different, methods, of, translation, 1813, he, distinguished, between, translation, methods, that, move, the, writer, toward, i, e, transparency, and, those, that, move, the, reader, toward, i, e, an, extreme, fidelity, to, the, foreignness, of, the, source, text, schleiermacher, favored, the, latter, approach, he, was, motivated, however, not, so, much, by, a, desire, to, embrace, the, foreign, as, by, a, nationalist, desire, to, oppose, france, s, cultural, domination, and, to, promote, german, literature, in, recent, decades, prominent, advocates, of, such, non, transparent, translation, have, included, the, french, scholar, antoine, berman, who, identified, twelve, deforming, tendencies, inherent, in, most, prose, translations, and, the, american, theorist, lawrence, venuti, who, has, called, on, translators, to, apply, foreignizing, rather, than, domesticating, translation, strategies, the, question, of, fidelity, vs, transparency, has, also, been, formulated, in, terms, of, respectively, formal, equivalence, and, dynamic, equivalence, expressions, associated, with, the, translator, eugene, nida, and, originally, coined, to, describe, ways, of, translating, the, bible, but, the, two, approaches, are, applicable, to, any, translation, formal, equivalence, corresponds, to, metaphrase, and, dynamic, equivalence, to, paraphrase, formal, equivalence, sought, via, literal, translation, attempts, to, render, the, text, literally, or, word, for, word, the, latter, expression, being, itself, a, word, for, word, rendering, of, the, classical, latin, verbum, pro, verbo, if, necessary, at, the, expense, of, features, natural, to, the, target, language, by, contrast, dynamic, equivalence, or, functional, equivalence, conveys, the, essential, thoughts, expressed, in, a, source, text, if, necessary, at, the, expense, of, literality, original, sememe, and, word, order, the, source, text, s, active, vs, passive, voice, etc, there, is, however, no, sharp, boundary, between, formal, and, functional, equivalence, on, the, contrary, they, represent, a, spectrum, of, translation, approaches, each, is, used, at, various, times, and, in, various, contexts, by, the, same, translator, and, at, various, points, within, the, same, text, sometimes, simultaneously, competent, translation, entails, the, judicious, blending, of, formal, and, functional, equivalents, common, pitfalls, in, translation, especially, when, practiced, by, inexperienced, translators, involve, false, equivalents, such, as, false, friends, and, false, cognates, in, the, practice, of, translation, the, source, language, is, the, language, being, translated, from, while, the, target, language, also, called, the, receptor, language, is, the, language, being, translated, into, difficulties, in, translating, can, arise, from, lexical, and, syntactical, differences, between, the, source, language, and, the, target, language, which, differences, tend, to, be, greater, between, two, languages, belonging, to, different, language, families, often, the, source, language, is, the, translator, s, second, language, while, the, target, language, is, the, translator, s, first, language, in, some, geographical, settings, however, the, source, language, is, the, translator, s, first, language, because, not, enough, people, speak, the, source, language, as, a, second, language, for, instance, a, 2005, survey, found, that, 89, of, professional, slovene, translators, translate, into, their, second, language, usually, english, in, cases, where, the, source, language, is, the, translator, s, first, language, the, translation, process, has, been, referred, to, by, various, terms, including, translating, into, a, non, mother, tongue, translating, into, a, second, language, inverse, translation, reverse, translation, service, translation, and, translation, from, a, to, b, the, process, typically, begins, with, a, full, and, in, depth, analysis, of, the, original, text, in, the, source, language, ensuring, full, comprehension, and, understanding, before, the, actual, act, of, translating, is, approached, translation, for, specialized, or, professional, fields, requires, a, working, knowledge, as, well, of, the, pertinent, terminology, in, the, field, for, example, translation, of, a, legal, text, requires, not, only, fluency, in, the, respective, languages, but, also, familiarity, with, the, terminology, specific, to, the, legal, field, in, each, language, while, the, form, and, style, of, the, source, language, often, cannot, be, reproduced, in, the, target, language, the, meaning, and, content, can, linguist, roman, jakobson, went, so, far, as, to, assert, that, all, cognitive, experience, can, be, classified, and, expressed, in, any, living, language, linguist, ghil, ad, zuckermann, suggests, that, the, limits, are, not, of, translation, per, se, but, rather, of, elegant, translation, 219, in, translation, a, source, text, st, is, a, text, written, in, a, given, source, language, which, is, to, be, or, has, been, translated, into, another, language, while, a, target, text, tt, is, a, translated, text, written, in, the, intended, target, language, which, is, the, result, of, a, translation, from, a, given, source, text, according, to, jeremy, munday, s, definition, of, translation, the, process, of, translation, between, two, different, written, languages, involves, the, changing, of, an, original, written, text, the, source, text, or, st, in, the, original, verbal, language, the, source, language, or, sl, into, a, written, text, the, target, text, or, tt, in, a, different, verbal, language, the, target, language, or, tl, the, terms, source, text, and, target, text, are, preferred, over, original, and, translation, because, they, do, not, have, the, same, positive, vs, negative, value, judgment, translation, scholars, including, eugene, nida, and, peter, newmark, have, represented, the, different, approaches, to, translation, as, falling, broadly, into, source, text, oriented, or, target, text, oriented, categories, a, back, translation, is, a, translation, of, a, translated, text, back, into, the, language, of, the, original, text, made, without, reference, to, the, original, text, comparison, of, a, back, translation, with, the, original, text, is, sometimes, used, as, a, check, on, the, accuracy, of, the, original, translation, much, as, the, accuracy, of, a, mathematical, operation, is, sometimes, checked, by, reversing, the, operation, but, the, results, of, such, reverse, translation, operations, while, useful, as, approximate, checks, are, not, always, precisely, reliable, back, translation, must, in, general, be, less, accurate, than, back, calculation, because, linguistic, symbols, words, are, often, ambiguous, whereas, mathematical, symbols, are, intentionally, unequivocal, in, the, context, of, machine, translation, a, back, translation, is, also, called, a, round, trip, translation, when, translations, are, produced, of, material, used, in, medical, clinical, trials, such, as, informed, consent, forms, a, back, translation, is, often, required, by, the, ethics, committee, or, institutional, review, board, mark, twain, provided, humorously, telling, evidence, for, the, frequent, unreliability, of, back, translation, when, he, issued, his, own, back, translation, of, a, french, translation, of, his, short, story, the, celebrated, jumping, frog, of, calaveras, county, he, published, his, back, translation, in, a, 1903, volume, together, with, his, english, language, original, the, french, translation, and, a, private, history, of, the, jumping, frog, story, the, latter, included, a, synopsized, adaptation, of, his, story, that, twain, stated, had, appeared, unattributed, to, twain, in, a, professor, sidgwick, s, greek, prose, composition, p, 116, under, the, title, the, athenian, and, the, frog, the, adaptation, had, for, a, time, been, taken, for, an, independent, ancient, greek, precursor, to, twain, s, jumping, frog, story, when, a, document, survives, only, in, translation, the, original, having, been, lost, researchers, sometimes, undertake, back, translation, in, an, effort, to, reconstruct, the, original, text, an, example, involves, the, novel, the, saragossa, manuscript, by, the, polish, aristocrat, jan, potocki, 1761, 1815, who, wrote, the, novel, in, french, and, anonymously, published, fragments, in, 1804, and, 1813, 14, portions, of, the, original, french, language, manuscript, were, subsequently, lost, however, the, missing, fragments, survived, in, a, polish, translation, made, by, edmund, chojecki, in, 1847, from, a, complete, french, copy, that, has, since, been, lost, french, language, versions, of, the, complete, saragossa, manuscript, have, since, been, produced, based, on, extant, french, language, fragments, and, on, french, language, versions, that, have, been, back, translated, from, chojecki, s, polish, version, many, works, by, the, influential, classical, physician, galen, survive, only, in, medieval, arabic, translation, some, survive, only, in, renaissance, latin, translations, from, the, arabic, thus, at, a, second, remove, from, the, original, to, better, understand, galen, scholars, have, attempted, back, translation, of, such, works, in, order, to, reconstruct, the, original, greek, when, historians, suspect, that, a, document, is, actually, a, translation, from, another, language, back, translation, into, that, hypothetical, original, language, can, provide, supporting, evidence, by, showing, that, such, characteristics, as, idioms, puns, peculiar, grammatical, structures, etc, are, in, fact, derived, from, the, original, language, for, example, the, known, text, of, the, till, eulenspiegel, folk, tales, is, in, high, german, but, contains, puns, that, work, only, when, back, translated, to, low, german, this, seems, clear, evidence, that, these, tales, or, at, least, large, portions, of, them, were, originally, written, in, low, german, and, translated, into, high, german, by, an, over, metaphrastic, translator, supporters, of, aramaic, primacy, the, view, that, the, christian, new, testament, or, its, sources, were, originally, written, in, the, aramaic, language, seek, to, prove, their, case, by, showing, that, difficult, passages, in, the, existing, greek, text, of, the, new, testament, make, much, more, sense, when, back, translated, to, aramaic, that, for, example, some, incomprehensible, references, are, in, fact, aramaic, puns, that, do, not, work, in, greek, due, to, similar, indications, it, is, believed, that, the, 2nd, century, gnostic, gospel, of, judas, which, survives, only, in, coptic, was, originally, written, in, greek, john, dryden, 1631, 1700, the, dominant, english, language, literary, figure, of, his, age, illustrates, in, his, use, of, back, translation, translators, influence, on, the, evolution, of, languages, and, literary, styles, dryden, is, believed, to, be, the, first, person, to, posit, that, english, sentences, should, not, end, in, prepositions, because, latin, sentences, cannot, end, in, prepositions, dryden, created, the, proscription, against, preposition, stranding, in, 1672, when, he, objected, to, ben, jonson, s, 1611, phrase, the, bodies, that, those, souls, were, frighted, from, though, he, did, not, provide, the, rationale, for, his, preference, dryden, often, translated, his, writing, into, latin, to, check, whether, his, writing, was, concise, and, elegant, latin, being, considered, an, elegant, and, long, lived, language, with, which, to, compare, then, he, back, translated, his, writing, back, to, english, according, to, latin, grammar, usage, as, latin, does, not, have, sentences, ending, in, prepositions, dryden, may, have, applied, latin, grammar, to, english, thus, forming, the, controversial, rule, of, no, sentence, ending, prepositions, subsequently, adopted, by, other, writers, competent, translators, show, the, following, attributes, a, competent, translator, is, not, only, bilingual, but, bicultural, a, language, is, not, merely, a, collection, of, words, and, of, rules, of, grammar, and, syntax, for, generating, sentences, but, also, a, vast, interconnecting, system, of, connotations, and, cultural, references, whose, mastery, writes, linguist, mario, pei, comes, close, to, being, a, lifetime, job, the, complexity, of, the, translator, s, task, cannot, be, overstated, one, author, suggests, that, becoming, an, accomplished, translator, after, having, already, acquired, a, good, basic, knowledge, of, both, languages, and, cultures, may, require, a, minimum, of, ten, years, experience, viewed, in, this, light, it, is, a, serious, misconception, to, assume, that, a, person, who, has, fair, fluency, in, two, languages, will, by, virtue, of, that, fact, alone, be, consistently, competent, to, translate, between, them, michael, wood, a, princeton, university, emeritus, professor, writes, ranslation, like, language, itself, involves, contexts, conventions, class, irony, posture, and, many, other, regions, where, speech, acts, hang, out, this, is, why, it, helps, to, compare, translations, emily, wilson, a, professor, of, classical, studies, at, the, university, of, pennsylvania, and, herself, a, translator, writes, t, is, to, produce, a, good, literary, translation, this, is, certainly, true, of, translations, of, ancient, greek, and, roman, texts, but, it, is, also, true, of, literary, translation, in, general, it, is, very, difficult, most, readers, of, foreign, languages, are, not, translators, most, writers, are, not, translators, translators, have, to, read, and, write, at, the, same, time, as, if, always, playing, multiple, instruments, in, a, one, person, band, and, most, one, person, bands, do, not, sound, very, good, when, in, 1921, three, years, before, his, death, the, english, language, novelist, joseph, conrad, who, had, long, had, little, contact, with, everyday, spoken, polish, attempted, to, translate, into, english, bruno, winawer, s, short, polish, language, play, the, book, of, job, he, predictably, missed, many, crucial, nuances, of, contemporary, polish, language, the, translator, s, role, in, relation, to, the, original, text, has, been, compared, to, the, roles, of, other, interpretive, artists, e, g, a, musician, or, actor, who, interprets, a, work, of, musical, or, dramatic, art, translating, especially, a, text, of, any, complexity, like, other, human, activities, involves, interpretation, choices, must, be, made, which, implies, interpretation, mark, polizzotti, writes, a, good, translation, offers, not, a, reproduction, of, the, work, but, an, interpretation, a, re, representation, just, as, the, performance, of, a, play, or, a, sonata, is, a, representation, of, the, script, or, the, score, one, among, many, possible, representations, a, translation, of, a, text, of, any, complexity, is, as, itself, a, work, of, art, unique, and, unrepeatable, conrad, whose, writings, zdzis, aw, najder, has, described, as, verging, on, auto, translation, from, conrad, s, polish, and, french, linguistic, personae, advised, his, niece, and, polish, translator, aniela, zag, rska, on, t, trouble, to, be, too, scrupulous, i, may, tell, you, in, french, that, in, my, opinion, il, vaut, mieux, interpr, ter, que, traduire, il, s, agit, donc, de, trouver, les, quivalents, et, l, ma, ch, re, je, vous, prie, laissez, vous, guider, plut, t, par, votre, temp, rament, que, par, une, conscience, s, v, re, conrad, advised, another, translator, that, the, prime, requisite, for, a, good, translation, is, that, it, be, idiomatic, for, in, the, idiom, is, the, clearness, of, a, language, and, the, language, s, force, and, its, picturesqueness, by, which, last, i, mean, the, picture, producing, power, of, arranged, words, conrad, thought, c, k, scott, moncrieff, s, english, translation, of, marcel, proust, s, la, recherche, du, temps, perdu, in, search, of, lost, time, or, in, scott, moncrieff, s, rendering, remembrance, of, things, past, to, be, preferable, to, the, french, original, emily, wilson, writes, that, translation, always, involves, interpretation, and, every, translator, to, think, as, deeply, as, humanly, possible, about, each, verbal, poetic, and, interpretative, choice, translation, of, other, than, the, simplest, brief, texts, requires, painstakingly, close, reading, of, the, source, text, and, the, draft, translation, so, as, to, resolve, the, ambiguities, inherent, in, language, and, thereby, to, asymptotically, approach, the, most, accurate, rendering, of, the, source, text, part, of, the, ambiguity, for, a, translator, involves, the, structure, of, human, language, psychologist, and, neural, scientist, gary, marcus, notes, that, virtually, every, sentence, is, ambiguous, often, in, multiple, ways, our, brain, is, so, good, at, comprehending, language, that, we, do, not, usually, notice, an, example, of, linguistic, ambiguity, is, the, pronoun, disambiguation, problem, pdp, a, machine, has, no, way, of, determining, to, whom, or, what, a, pronoun, in, a, sentence, such, as, he, she, or, it, refers, such, disambiguation, is, not, infallible, by, a, human, either, ambiguity, is, a, concern, both, to, translators, and, as, the, writings, of, poet, and, literary, critic, william, empson, have, demonstrated, to, literary, critics, ambiguity, may, be, desirable, indeed, essential, in, poetry, and, diplomacy, it, can, be, more, problematic, in, ordinary, prose, individual, expressions, words, phrases, sentences, are, fraught, with, connotations, as, empson, demonstrates, any, piece, of, language, seems, susceptible, to, alternative, reactions, or, as, joseph, conrad, once, wrote, no, english, word, has, clean, edges, all, expressions, conrad, thought, carried, so, many, connotations, as, to, be, little, more, than, instruments, for, exciting, blurred, emotions, christopher, kasparek, also, cautions, that, competent, translation, analogously, to, the, dictum, in, mathematics, of, kurt, g, del, s, incompleteness, theorems, generally, requires, more, information, about, the, subject, matter, than, is, present, in, the, actual, source, text, therefore, translation, of, a, text, of, any, complexity, typically, requires, some, research, on, the, translator, s, part, a, translator, faces, two, contradictory, tasks, when, translating, to, strive, for, omniscience, concerning, the, text, and, when, reviewing, the, resulting, translation, to, adopt, the, reader, s, unfamiliarity, with, it, analogously, n, the, process, the, translator, is, also, constantly, seesawing, between, the, respective, linguistic, and, cultural, features, of, his, two, languages, thus, writes, kasparek, translating, a, text, of, any, complexity, like, the, performing, of, a, musical, or, dramatic, work, involves, interpretation, choices, must, be, made, which, entails, interpretation, bernard, shaw, aspiring, to, felicitous, understanding, of, literary, works, wrote, in, the, preface, to, his, 1901, volume, three, plays, for, puritans, i, would, give, half, a, dozen, of, shakespeare, s, plays, for, one, of, the, prefaces, he, ought, to, have, written, it, is, due, to, the, inescapable, necessity, of, interpretation, that, pace, the, story, about, the, 3rd, century, bce, septuagint, translations, of, some, biblical, old, testament, books, from, hebrew, into, koine, greek, no, two, translations, of, a, literary, work, by, different, hands, or, by, the, same, hand, at, different, times, are, likely, to, be, identical, as, has, been, observed, by, leonardo, da, vinci, paul, valery, e, m, forster, pablo, picasso, by, all, of, them, a, work, of, art, is, never, finished, only, abandoned, translators, may, render, only, parts, of, the, original, text, provided, that, they, inform, readers, of, that, action, but, a, translator, should, not, assume, the, role, of, censor, and, surreptitiously, delete, or, bowdlerize, passages, merely, to, please, a, political, or, moral, interest, translating, has, served, as, a, school, of, writing, for, many, an, author, much, as, the, copying, of, masterworks, of, painting, has, schooled, many, a, novice, painter, a, translator, who, can, competently, render, an, author, s, thoughts, into, the, translator, s, own, language, should, certainly, be, able, to, adequately, render, in, his, own, language, any, thoughts, of, his, own, translating, like, analytic, philosophy, compels, precise, analysis, of, language, elements, and, of, their, usage, in, 1946, the, poet, ezra, pound, then, at, st, elizabeth, s, hospital, in, washington, d, c, advised, a, visitor, the, 18, year, old, beginning, poet, w, s, merwin, the, work, of, translation, is, the, best, teacher, you, ll, ever, have, merwin, translator, poet, who, took, pound, s, advice, to, heart, writes, of, translation, as, an, impossible, unfinishable, art, translators, including, monks, who, spread, buddhist, texts, in, east, asia, and, the, early, modern, european, translators, of, the, bible, in, the, course, of, their, work, have, shaped, the, very, languages, into, which, they, have, translated, they, have, acted, as, bridges, for, conveying, knowledge, between, cultures, and, along, with, ideas, they, have, imported, from, the, source, languages, into, their, own, languages, loanwords, and, calques, of, grammatical, structures, idioms, and, vocabulary, interpreting, is, the, facilitation, of, oral, or, sign, language, communication, either, simultaneously, or, consecutively, between, two, or, among, three, or, more, speakers, who, are, not, speaking, or, signing, the, same, language, the, term, interpreting, rather, than, interpretation, is, preferentially, used, for, this, activity, by, anglophone, interpreters, and, translators, to, avoid, confusion, with, other, meanings, of, the, word, interpretation, unlike, english, many, languages, do, not, employ, two, separate, words, to, denote, the, activities, of, written, and, live, communication, oral, or, sign, language, translators, even, english, does, not, always, make, the, distinction, frequently, using, translating, as, a, synonym, for, interpreting, interpreters, have, sometimes, played, crucial, roles, in, human, history, a, prime, example, is, la, malinche, also, known, as, malintzin, malinalli, and, do, a, marina, an, early, 16th, century, nahua, woman, from, the, mexican, gulf, coast, as, a, child, she, had, been, sold, or, given, to, maya, slave, traders, from, xicalango, and, thus, had, become, bilingual, subsequently, given, along, with, other, women, to, the, invading, spaniards, she, became, instrumental, in, the, spanish, conquest, of, mexico, acting, as, interpreter, adviser, intermediary, and, lover, to, hern, n, cort, s, nearly, three, centuries, later, in, the, united, states, a, comparable, role, as, interpreter, was, played, for, the, lewis, and, clark, expedition, of, 1804, 6, by, sacagawea, as, a, child, the, lemhi, shoshone, woman, had, been, kidnapped, by, hidatsa, indians, and, thus, had, become, bilingual, sacagawea, facilitated, the, expedition, s, traverse, of, the, north, american, continent, to, the, pacific, ocean, the, famous, chinese, man, of, letters, lin, shu, 1852, 1924, who, knew, no, foreign, languages, rendered, western, literary, classics, into, chinese, with, the, help, of, his, friend, wang, shouchang, who, had, studied, in, france, wang, interpreted, the, texts, for, lin, who, rendered, them, into, chinese, lin, s, first, such, translation, past, stories, of, the, camellia, woman, of, paris, alexandre, dumas, fils, s, la, dame, aux, cam, lias, published, in, 1899, was, an, immediate, success, and, was, followed, by, many, more, translations, from, the, french, and, the, english, sworn, translation, also, called, certified, translation, aims, at, legal, equivalence, between, two, documents, written, in, different, languages, it, is, performed, by, someone, authorized, to, do, so, by, local, regulations, which, vary, widely, from, country, to, country, some, countries, recognize, self, declared, competence, others, require, the, translator, to, be, an, official, state, appointee, in, some, countries, such, as, the, united, kingdom, certain, government, institutions, require, that, translators, be, accredited, by, certain, translation, institutes, or, associations, in, order, to, be, able, to, carry, out, certified, translations, many, commercial, services, exist, that, will, interpret, spoken, language, via, telephone, there, is, also, at, least, one, custom, built, mobile, device, that, does, the, same, thing, the, device, connects, users, to, human, interpreters, who, can, translate, between, english, and, 180, other, languages, web, based, human, translation, is, generally, favored, by, companies, and, individuals, that, wish, to, secure, more, accurate, translations, in, view, of, the, frequent, inaccuracy, of, machine, translations, human, translation, remains, the, most, reliable, most, accurate, form, of, translation, available, with, the, recent, emergence, of, translation, crowdsourcing, translation, memory, techniques, and, internet, applications, translation, agencies, have, been, able, to, provide, on, demand, human, translation, services, to, businesses, individuals, and, enterprises, while, not, instantaneous, like, its, machine, counterparts, such, as, google, translate, and, babel, fish, now, defunct, as, of, 2010, web, based, human, translation, has, been, gaining, popularity, by, providing, relatively, fast, accurate, translation, of, business, communications, legal, documents, medical, records, and, software, localization, web, based, human, translation, also, appeals, to, private, website, users, and, bloggers, contents, of, websites, are, translatable, but, urls, of, websites, are, not, translatable, into, other, languages, language, tools, on, the, internet, provide, help, in, understanding, text, computer, assisted, translation, cat, also, called, computer, aided, translation, machine, aided, human, translation, maht, and, interactive, translation, is, a, form, of, translation, wherein, a, human, translator, creates, a, target, text, with, the, assistance, of, a, computer, program, the, machine, supports, a, human, translator, computer, assisted, translation, can, include, standard, dictionary, and, grammar, software, the, term, however, normally, refers, to, a, range, of, specialized, programs, available, to, the, translator, including, translation, memory, terminology, management, concordance, and, alignment, programs, these, tools, speed, up, and, facilitate, human, translation, but, they, do, not, provide, translation, the, latter, is, a, function, of, tools, known, broadly, as, machine, translation, the, tools, speed, up, the, translation, process, by, assisting, the, human, translator, by, memorizing, or, committing, translations, to, a, database, translation, memory, database, so, that, if, the, same, sentence, occurs, in, the, same, project, or, a, future, project, the, content, can, be, reused, this, translation, reuse, leads, to, cost, savings, better, consistency, and, shorter, project, timelines, machine, translation, mt, is, a, process, whereby, a, computer, program, analyzes, a, source, text, and, in, principle, produces, a, target, text, without, human, intervention, in, reality, however, machine, translation, typically, does, involve, human, intervention, in, the, form, of, pre, editing, and, post, editing, with, proper, terminology, work, with, preparation, of, the, source, text, for, machine, translation, pre, editing, and, with, reworking, of, the, machine, translation, by, a, human, translator, post, editing, commercial, machine, translation, tools, can, produce, useful, results, especially, if, the, machine, translation, system, is, integrated, with, a, translation, memory, or, translation, management, system, unedited, machine, translation, is, publicly, available, through, tools, on, the, internet, such, as, google, translate, almaany, babylon, deepl, translator, and, stardict, these, produce, rough, translations, that, under, favorable, circumstances, approximate, the, meaning, of, the, source, text, with, the, internet, translation, software, can, help, non, native, speaking, individuals, understand, web, pages, published, in, other, languages, whole, page, translation, tools, are, of, limited, utility, however, since, they, offer, only, a, limited, potential, understanding, of, the, original, author, s, intent, and, context, translated, pages, tend, to, be, more, erroneously, humorous, and, confusing, than, enlightening, interactive, translations, with, pop, up, windows, are, becoming, more, popular, these, tools, show, one, or, more, possible, equivalents, for, each, word, or, phrase, human, operators, merely, need, to, select, the, likeliest, equivalent, as, the, mouse, glides, over, the, foreign, language, text, possible, equivalents, can, be, grouped, by, pronunciation, also, companies, such, as, ectaco, produce, pocket, devices, that, provide, machine, translations, relying, exclusively, on, unedited, machine, translation, however, ignores, the, fact, that, communication, in, human, language, is, context, embedded, and, that, it, takes, a, person, to, comprehend, the, context, of, the, original, text, with, a, reasonable, degree, of, probability, it, is, certainly, true, that, even, purely, human, generated, translations, are, prone, to, error, therefore, to, ensure, that, a, machine, generated, translation, will, be, useful, to, a, human, being, and, that, publishable, quality, translation, is, achieved, such, translations, must, be, reviewed, and, edited, by, a, human, claude, piron, writes, that, machine, translation, at, its, best, automates, the, easier, part, of, a, translator, s, job, the, harder, and, more, time, consuming, part, usually, involves, doing, extensive, research, to, resolve, ambiguities, in, the, source, text, which, the, grammatical, and, lexical, exigencies, of, the, target, language, require, to, be, resolved, such, research, is, a, necessary, prelude, to, the, pre, editing, necessary, in, order, to, provide, input, for, machine, translation, software, such, that, the, output, will, not, be, meaningless, the, weaknesses, of, pure, machine, translation, unaided, by, human, expertise, are, those, of, artificial, intelligence, itself, as, of, 2018, professional, translator, mark, polizzotti, held, that, machine, translation, by, google, translate, and, the, like, was, unlikely, to, threaten, human, translators, anytime, soon, because, machines, would, never, grasp, nuance, and, connotation, writes, paul, taylor, perhaps, there, is, a, limit, to, what, a, computer, can, do, without, knowing, that, it, is, manipulating, imperfect, representations, of, an, external, reality, translation, of, literary, works, novels, short, stories, plays, poems, etc, is, considered, a, literary, pursuit, in, its, own, right, notable, in, canadian, literature, specifically, as, translators, are, figures, such, as, sheila, fischman, robert, dickson, and, linda, gaboriau, and, the, canadian, governor, general, s, awards, annually, present, prizes, for, the, best, english, to, french, and, french, to, english, literary, translations, other, writers, among, many, who, have, made, a, name, for, themselves, as, literary, translators, include, vasily, zhukovsky, tadeusz, boy, ele, ski, vladimir, nabokov, jorge, luis, borges, robert, stiller, lydia, davis, haruki, murakami, achy, obejas, and, jhumpa, lahiri, in, the, 2010s, a, substantial, gender, imbalance, was, noted, in, literary, translation, into, english, with, far, more, male, writers, being, translated, than, women, writers, in, 2014, meytal, radzinski, launched, the, women, in, translation, campaign, to, address, this, the, first, important, translation, in, the, west, was, that, of, the, septuagint, a, collection, of, jewish, scriptures, translated, into, early, koine, greek, in, alexandria, between, the, 3rd, and, 1st, centuries, bce, the, dispersed, jews, had, forgotten, their, ancestral, language, and, needed, greek, versions, translations, of, their, scriptures, throughout, the, middle, ages, latin, was, the, lingua, franca, of, the, western, learned, world, the, 9th, century, alfred, the, great, king, of, wessex, in, england, was, far, ahead, of, his, time, in, commissioning, vernacular, anglo, saxon, translations, of, bede, s, ecclesiastical, history, and, boethius, consolation, of, philosophy, meanwhile, the, christian, church, frowned, on, even, partial, adaptations, of, st, jerome, s, vulgate, of, c, 384, ce, the, standard, latin, bible, in, asia, the, spread, of, buddhism, led, to, large, scale, ongoing, translation, efforts, spanning, well, over, a, thousand, years, the, tangut, empire, was, especially, efficient, in, such, efforts, exploiting, the, then, newly, invented, block, printing, and, with, the, full, support, of, the, government, contemporary, sources, describe, the, emperor, and, his, mother, personally, contributing, to, the, translation, effort, alongside, sages, of, various, nationalities, the, tanguts, took, mere, decades, to, translate, volumes, that, had, taken, the, chinese, centuries, to, render, the, arabs, undertook, large, scale, efforts, at, translation, having, conquered, the, greek, world, they, made, arabic, versions, of, its, philosophical, and, scientific, works, during, the, middle, ages, translations, of, some, of, these, arabic, versions, were, made, into, latin, chiefly, at, c, rdoba, in, spain, king, alfonso, x, the, wise, of, castile, in, the, 13th, century, promoted, this, effort, by, founding, a, schola, traductorum, school, of, translation, in, toledo, there, arabic, texts, hebrew, texts, and, latin, texts, were, translated, into, the, other, tongues, by, muslim, jewish, and, christian, scholars, who, also, argued, the, merits, of, their, respective, religions, latin, translations, of, greek, and, original, arab, works, of, scholarship, and, science, helped, advance, european, scholasticism, and, thus, european, science, and, culture, the, broad, historic, trends, in, western, translation, practice, may, be, illustrated, on, the, example, of, translation, into, the, english, language, the, first, fine, translations, into, english, were, made, in, the, 14th, century, by, geoffrey, chaucer, who, adapted, from, the, italian, of, giovanni, boccaccio, in, his, own, knight, s, tale, and, troilus, and, criseyde, began, a, translation, of, the, french, language, roman, de, la, rose, and, completed, a, translation, of, boethius, from, the, latin, chaucer, founded, an, english, poetic, tradition, on, adaptations, and, translations, from, those, earlier, established, literary, languages, the, first, great, english, translation, was, the, wycliffe, bible, c, 1382, which, showed, the, weaknesses, of, an, underdeveloped, english, prose, only, at, the, end, of, the, 15th, century, did, the, great, age, of, english, prose, translation, begin, with, thomas, malory, s, le, morte, d, arthur, an, adaptation, of, arthurian, romances, so, free, that, it, can, in, fact, hardly, be, called, a, true, translation, the, first, great, tudor, translations, are, accordingly, the, tyndale, new, testament, 1525, which, influenced, the, authorized, version, 1611, and, lord, berners, version, of, jean, froissart, s, chronicles, 1523, 25, meanwhile, in, renaissance, italy, a, new, period, in, the, history, of, translation, had, opened, in, florence, with, the, arrival, at, the, court, of, cosimo, de, medici, of, the, byzantine, scholar, georgius, gemistus, pletho, shortly, before, the, fall, of, constantinople, to, the, turks, 1453, a, latin, translation, of, plato, s, works, was, undertaken, by, marsilio, ficino, this, and, erasmus, latin, edition, of, the, new, testament, led, to, a, new, attitude, to, translation, for, the, first, time, readers, demanded, rigor, of, rendering, as, philosophical, and, religious, beliefs, depended, on, the, exact, words, of, plato, aristotle, and, jesus, non, scholarly, literature, however, continued, to, rely, on, adaptation, france, s, pl, iade, england, s, tudor, poets, and, the, elizabethan, translators, adapted, themes, by, horace, ovid, petrarch, and, modern, latin, writers, forming, a, new, poetic, style, on, those, models, the, english, poets, and, translators, sought, to, supply, a, new, public, created, by, the, rise, of, a, middle, class, and, the, development, of, printing, with, works, such, as, the, original, authors, would, have, written, had, they, been, writing, in, england, in, that, day, the, elizabethan, period, of, translation, saw, considerable, progress, beyond, mere, paraphrase, toward, an, ideal, of, stylistic, equivalence, but, even, to, the, end, of, this, period, which, actually, reached, to, the, middle, of, the, 17th, century, there, was, no, concern, for, verbal, accuracy, in, the, second, half, of, the, 17th, century, the, poet, john, dryden, sought, to, make, virgil, speak, in, words, such, as, he, would, probably, have, written, if, he, were, living, and, an, englishman, as, great, as, dryden, s, poem, is, however, one, is, reading, dryden, and, not, experiencing, the, roman, poet, s, concision, similarly, homer, arguably, suffers, from, alexander, pope, s, endeavor, to, reduce, the, greek, poet, s, wild, paradise, to, order, both, works, live, on, as, worthy, english, epics, more, than, as, a, point, of, access, to, the, latin, or, greek, throughout, the, 18th, century, the, watchword, of, translators, was, ease, of, reading, whatever, they, did, not, understand, in, a, text, or, thought, might, bore, readers, they, omitted, they, cheerfully, assumed, that, their, own, style, of, expression, was, the, best, and, that, texts, should, be, made, to, conform, to, it, in, translation, for, scholarship, they, cared, no, more, than, had, their, predecessors, and, they, did, not, shrink, from, making, translations, from, translations, in, third, languages, or, from, languages, that, they, hardly, knew, or, as, in, the, case, of, james, macpherson, s, translations, of, ossian, from, texts, that, were, actually, of, the, translator, s, own, composition, the, 19th, century, brought, new, standards, of, accuracy, and, style, in, regard, to, accuracy, observes, j, m, cohen, the, policy, became, the, text, the, whole, text, and, nothing, but, the, text, except, for, any, bawdy, passages, and, the, addition, of, copious, explanatory, footnotes, in, regard, to, style, the, victorians, aim, achieved, through, far, reaching, metaphrase, literality, or, pseudo, metaphrase, was, to, constantly, remind, readers, that, they, were, reading, a, foreign, classic, an, exception, was, the, outstanding, translation, in, this, period, edward, fitzgerald, s, rubaiyat, of, omar, khayyam, 1859, which, achieved, its, oriental, flavor, largely, by, using, persian, names, and, discreet, biblical, echoes, and, actually, drew, little, of, its, material, from, the, persian, original, in, advance, of, the, 20th, century, a, new, pattern, was, set, in, 1871, by, benjamin, jowett, who, translated, plato, into, simple, straightforward, language, jowett, s, example, was, not, followed, however, until, well, into, the, new, century, when, accuracy, rather, than, style, became, the, principal, criterion, as, a, language, evolves, texts, in, an, earlier, version, of, the, language, original, texts, or, old, translations, may, become, difficult, for, modern, readers, to, understand, such, a, text, may, therefore, be, translated, into, more, modern, language, producing, a, modern, translation, e, g, a, modern, english, translation, or, modernized, translation, such, modern, rendering, is, applied, either, to, literature, from, classical, languages, such, as, latin, or, greek, notably, to, the, bible, see, modern, english, bible, translations, or, to, literature, from, an, earlier, stage, of, the, same, language, as, with, the, works, of, william, shakespeare, which, are, largely, understandable, by, a, modern, audience, though, with, some, difficulty, or, with, geoffrey, chaucer, s, middle, english, canterbury, tales, which, is, understandable, to, most, modern, readers, only, through, heavy, dependence, on, footnotes, in, 2015, the, oregon, shakespeare, festival, commissioned, professional, translation, of, the, entire, shakespeare, canon, including, disputed, works, such, as, edward, iii, into, contemporary, vernacular, english, in, 2019, off, off, broadway, the, canon, was, premiered, in, a, month, long, series, of, staged, readings, modern, translation, is, applicable, to, any, language, with, a, long, literary, history, for, example, in, japanese, the, 11th, century, tale, of, genji, is, generally, read, in, modern, translation, see, genji, modern, readership, modern, translation, often, involves, literary, scholarship, and, textual, revision, as, there, is, frequently, not, one, single, canonical, text, this, is, particularly, noteworthy, in, the, case, of, the, bible, and, shakespeare, where, modern, scholarship, can, result, in, substantive, textual, changes, anna, north, writes, translating, the, long, dead, language, homer, used, a, variant, of, ancient, greek, called, homeric, greek, into, contemporary, english, is, no, easy, task, and, translators, bring, their, own, skills, opinions, and, stylistic, sensibilities, to, the, text, the, result, is, that, every, translation, is, different, almost, a, new, poem, in, itself, an, example, is, emily, wilson, s, 2017, translation, of, homer, s, odyssey, where, by, conscious, choice, wilson, lays, bare, the, morals, of, its, time, and, place, and, invites, us, to, consider, how, different, they, are, from, our, own, and, how, similar, modern, translation, meets, with, opposition, from, some, traditionalists, in, english, some, readers, prefer, the, authorized, king, james, version, of, the, bible, to, modern, translations, and, shakespeare, in, the, original, of, c, 1600, to, modern, translations, an, opposite, process, involves, translating, modern, literature, into, classical, languages, for, the, purpose, of, extensive, reading, for, examples, see, list, of, latin, translations, of, modern, literature, views, on, the, possibility, of, satisfactorily, translating, poetry, show, a, broad, spectrum, depending, partly, on, the, degree, of, latitude, desired, by, the, translator, in, regard, to, a, poem, s, formal, features, rhythm, rhyme, verse, form, etc, but, also, relating, to, how, much, of, the, suggestiveness, and, imagery, in, the, host, poem, can, be, recaptured, or, approximated, in, the, target, language, in, his, 1997, book, le, ton, beau, de, marot, douglas, hofstadter, argued, that, a, good, translation, of, a, poem, must, convey, as, much, as, possible, not, only, of, its, literal, meaning, but, also, of, its, form, and, structure, meter, rhyme, or, alliteration, scheme, etc, the, russian, born, linguist, and, semiotician, roman, jakobson, however, had, in, his, 1959, paper, on, linguistic, aspects, of, translation, declared, that, poetry, by, definition, untranslatable, vladimir, nabokov, another, russian, born, author, took, a, view, similar, to, jakobson, s, he, considered, rhymed, metrical, versed, poetry, to, be, in, principle, untranslatable, and, therefore, rendered, his, 1964, english, translation, of, alexander, pushkin, s, eugene, onegin, in, prose, hofstadter, in, le, ton, beau, de, marot, criticized, nabokov, s, attitude, toward, verse, translation, in, 1999, hofstadter, published, his, own, translation, of, eugene, onegin, in, verse, form, however, a, number, of, more, contemporary, literary, translators, of, poetry, lean, toward, alexander, von, humboldt, s, notion, of, language, as, a, third, universe, existing, midway, between, the, phenomenal, reality, of, the, empirical, world, and, the, internalized, structures, of, consciousness, perhaps, this, is, what, poet, sholeh, wolp, translator, of, the, 12th, century, iranian, epic, poem, the, conference, of, the, birds, means, when, she, writes, twelfth, century, persian, and, contemporary, english, are, as, different, as, sky, and, sea, the, best, i, can, do, as, a, poet, is, to, reflect, one, into, the, other, the, sea, can, reflect, the, sky, with, its, moving, stars, shifting, clouds, gestations, of, the, moon, and, migrating, birds, but, ultimately, the, sea, is, not, the, sky, by, nature, it, is, liquid, it, ripples, there, are, waves, if, you, are, a, fish, living, in, the, sea, you, can, only, understand, the, sky, if, its, reflection, becomes, part, of, the, water, therefore, this, translation, of, the, conference, of, the, birds, while, faithful, to, the, original, text, aims, at, its, re, creation, into, a, still, living, and, breathing, work, of, literature, poet, sherod, santos, writes, the, task, is, not, to, reproduce, the, content, but, with, the, flint, and, the, steel, of, one, s, own, language, to, spark, what, robert, lowell, has, called, the, fire, and, finish, of, the, original, according, to, walter, benjamin, while, a, poet, s, words, endure, in, his, own, language, even, the, greatest, translation, is, destined, to, become, part, of, the, growth, of, its, own, language, and, eventually, to, perish, with, its, renewal, translation, is, so, far, removed, from, being, the, sterile, equation, of, two, dead, languages, that, of, all, literary, forms, it, is, the, one, charged, with, the, special, mission, of, watching, over, the, maturing, process, of, the, original, language, and, the, birth, pangs, of, its, own, gregory, hays, in, the, course, of, discussing, roman, adapted, translations, of, ancient, greek, literature, makes, approving, reference, to, some, views, on, the, translating, of, poetry, expressed, by, david, bellos, an, accomplished, french, to, english, translator, hays, writes, among, the, id, es, re, ues, skewered, by, david, bellos, is, the, old, saw, that, poetry, is, what, gets, lost, in, translation, the, saying, is, often, attributed, to, robert, frost, but, as, bellos, notes, the, attribution, is, as, dubious, as, the, idea, itself, a, translation, is, an, assemblage, of, words, and, as, such, it, can, contain, as, much, or, as, little, poetry, as, any, other, such, assemblage, the, japanese, even, have, a, word, ch, yaku, roughly, hypertranslation, to, designate, a, version, that, deliberately, improves, on, the, original, book, title, translations, can, be, either, descriptive, or, symbolic, descriptive, book, titles, for, example, antoine, de, saint, exup, ry, s, le, petit, prince, the, little, prince, are, meant, to, be, informative, and, can, name, the, protagonist, and, indicate, the, theme, of, the, book, an, example, of, a, symbolic, book, title, is, stieg, larsson, s, the, girl, with, the, dragon, tattoo, whose, original, swedish, title, is, m, n, som, hatar, kvinnor, men, who, hate, women, such, symbolic, book, titles, usually, indicate, the, theme, issues, or, atmosphere, of, the, work, when, translators, are, working, with, long, book, titles, the, translated, titles, are, often, shorter, and, indicate, the, theme, of, the, book, the, translation, of, plays, poses, many, problems, such, as, the, added, element, of, actors, speech, duration, translation, literalness, and, the, relationship, between, the, arts, of, drama, and, acting, successful, play, translators, are, able, to, create, language, that, allows, the, actor, and, the, playwright, to, work, together, effectively, play, translators, must, also, take, into, account, several, other, aspects, the, final, performance, varying, theatrical, and, acting, traditions, characters, speaking, styles, modern, theatrical, discourse, and, even, the, acoustics, of, the, auditorium, i, e, whether, certain, words, will, have, the, same, effect, on, the, new, audience, as, they, had, on, the, original, audience, audiences, in, shakespeare, s, time, were, more, accustomed, than, modern, playgoers, to, actors, having, longer, stage, time, modern, translators, tend, to, simplify, the, sentence, structures, of, earlier, dramas, which, included, compound, sentences, with, intricate, hierarchies, of, subordinate, clauses, in, translating, chinese, literature, translators, struggle, to, find, true, fidelity, in, translating, into, the, target, language, in, the, poem, behind, the, poem, barnstone, argues, that, poetry, can, t, be, made, to, sing, through, a, mathematics, that, doesn, t, factor, in, the, creativity, of, the, translator, a, notable, piece, of, work, translated, into, english, is, the, wen, xuan, an, anthology, representative, of, major, works, of, chinese, literature, translating, this, work, requires, a, high, knowledge, of, the, genres, presented, in, the, book, such, as, poetic, forms, various, prose, types, including, memorials, letters, proclamations, praise, poems, edicts, and, historical, philosophical, and, political, disquisitions, threnodies, and, laments, for, the, dead, and, examination, essays, thus, the, literary, translator, must, be, familiar, with, the, writings, lives, and, thought, of, a, large, number, of, its, 130, authors, making, the, wen, xuan, one, of, the, most, difficult, literary, works, to, translate, translation, of, a, text, that, is, sung, in, vocal, music, for, the, purpose, of, singing, in, another, language, sometimes, called, singing, translation, is, closely, linked, to, translation, of, poetry, because, most, vocal, music, at, least, in, the, western, tradition, is, set, to, verse, especially, verse, in, regular, patterns, with, rhyme, since, the, late, 19th, century, musical, setting, of, prose, and, free, verse, has, also, been, practiced, in, some, art, music, though, popular, music, tends, to, remain, conservative, in, its, retention, of, stanzaic, forms, with, or, without, refrains, a, rudimentary, example, of, translating, poetry, for, singing, is, church, hymns, such, as, the, german, chorales, translated, into, english, by, catherine, winkworth, translation, of, sung, texts, is, generally, much, more, restrictive, than, translation, of, poetry, because, in, the, former, there, is, little, or, no, freedom, to, choose, between, a, versified, translation, and, a, translation, that, dispenses, with, verse, structure, one, might, modify, or, omit, rhyme, in, a, singing, translation, but, the, assignment, of, syllables, to, specific, notes, in, the, original, musical, setting, places, great, challenges, on, the, translator, there, is, the, option, in, prose, sung, texts, less, so, in, verse, of, adding, or, deleting, a, syllable, here, and, there, by, subdividing, or, combining, notes, respectively, but, even, with, prose, the, process, is, almost, like, strict, verse, translation, because, of, the, need, to, stick, as, closely, as, possible, to, the, original, prosody, of, the, sung, melodic, line, other, considerations, in, writing, a, singing, translation, include, repetition, of, words, and, phrases, the, placement, of, rests, and, punctuation, the,

translation, may, be, considerably, or, completely, different, from, the, original, thus, resulting, in, a, contrafactum, translations, of, sung, texts, whether, of, the, above, type, meant, to, be, sung, or, of, a, more, or, less, literal, type, meant, to, be, read, are, also, used, as, aids, to, audiences, singers, and, conductors, when, a, work, is, being, sung, in, a, language, not, known,

accompany, commercial, audio, cds, of, vocal, music, in, addition, professional, and, amateur, singers, often, sing, works, in, languages, they, do, not, know, or, do, not, know, well, and, translations, are, then, used, to, enable, them, to, understand, the, meaning, of, the, words, they, are, singing, an, important, role, in, history, has, been, played, by, translation, of, religious, texts, such, translations, may, be, influenced, by, tension, between, the, text, and, the, religious, values, the, translators, wish, to, convey, for, example, buddhist, monks, who, translated, the, indian, sutras, into, chinese, occasionally, adjusted, their, translations, to, better, reflect, china, s, distinct, culture, emphasizing, notions, such, as, filial, piety, one, of, the, first, recorded, instances, of, translation, in, the, west, was, the, 3rd, century, bce, rendering, of, some, books, of, the, biblical, old, testament, from, hebrew, into, koine, greek, the, translation, is, known, as, the, septuagint, a, name, that, refers, to, the, supposedly, seventy, translators, seventy, two, in, some, versions, who, were, commissioned, to, translate, the, bible, at, alexandria, egypt, according, to, legend, each, translator, worked, in, solitary, confinement, in, his, own, cell, and, all, seventy, versions, proved, identical, the, septuagint, became, the, source, text, for, later, translations, into, many, languages, including, latin, coptic, armenian, and, georgian, still, considered, one, of, the, greatest, translators, in, history, for, having, rendered, the, bible, into, latin, is, jerome, 347, 420, ce, the, patron, saint, of, translators, for, centuries, the, roman, catholic, church, used, his, translation, known, as, the, vulgate, though, even, this, translation, stirred, controversy, by, contrast, with, jerome, s, contemporary, augustine, of, hippo, 354, 430, ce, who, endorsed, precise, translation, jerome, believed, in, adaptation, and, sometimes, invention, in, order, to, more, effectively, bring, across, the, meaning, jerome, s, colorful, vulgate, translation, of, the, bible, includes, some, crucial, instances, of, overdetermination, for, example, isaiah, s, prophecy, announcing, that, the, savior, will, be, born, of, a, virgin, uses, the, word, almah, which, is, also, used, to, describe, the, dancing, girls, at, solomon, s, court, and, simply, means, young, and, nubile, jerome, writes, marina, warner, translates, it, as, virgo, adding, divine, authority, to, the, virulent, cult, of, sexual, disgust, that, shaped, christian, moral, theology, the, quran, free, from, this, linguistic, trap, does, not, connect, mariam, mary, s, miraculous, nature, with, moral, horror, of, sex, the, apple, that, eve, offered, to, adam, according, to, mark, polizzotti, could, equally, well, have, been, an, apricot, orange, or, banana, but, jerome, liked, the, pun, malus, malum, apple, evil, pope, francis, has, suggested, that, the, phrase, lead, us, not, into, temptation, in, the, lord, s, prayer, found, in, the, gospels, of, matthew, the, first, gospel, written, c, 80, 90, ce, and, luke, the, third,

important, early, christian, authors, interpreted, the, bible, s, greek, text, and, jerome, s, latin, vulgate, similarly, to, pope, francis, a, j, b, higgins, in, 1943, showed, that, among, the, earliest, christian, authors, the, understanding, and, even, the, text, of, this, devotional, verse, underwent, considerable, changes, these, ancient, writers, suggest, that, even, if, the, greek, and, latin, texts, are, left, unmodified, something, like, do, not, let, us, fall, could, be, an, acceptable, english, rendering, higgins, cited, tertullian, the, earliest, of, the, latin, church, fathers, c, 155, c, 240, ce, do, not, allow, us, to, be, led, and, cyprian, c, 200, 258, ce, do, not, allow, us, to, be, led, into, temptation, a, later, author, ambrose, c, 340, 397, ce, followed, cyprian, s, interpretation, augustine, of, hippo, 354, 430, familiar, with, jerome, s, latin, vulgate, rendering, observed, that, many, people, say, it, this, way, and, do, not, allow, us, to, be, led, into, temptation, in, 863, ce, the, brothers, saints, cyril, and, methodius, the, byzantine, empire, s, apostles, to, the, slavs, began, translating, parts, of, the, bible, into, the, old, church, slavonic, language, using, the, glagolitic, script, that, they, had, devised, based, on, the, greek, alphabet, the, periods, preceding, and, contemporary, with, the, protestant, reformation, saw, translations, of, the, bible, into, vernacular, local, european, languages, a, development, that, contributed, to, western, christianity, s, split, into, roman, catholicism, and, protestantism, over, disparities, between, catholic, and, protestant, renderings, of, crucial, words, and, passages, and, due, to, a, protestant, perceived, need, to, reform, the, roman, catholic, church, lasting, effects, on, the, religions, cultures, and, languages, of, their, respective, countries, were, exerted, by, such, bible, translations, as, martin, luther, s, into, german, the, new, testament, 1522, jakub, wujek, s, into, polish, 1599, as, revised, by, the, jesuits, and, william, tyndale, s, version, new, testament, 1526, and, revisions, and, the, king, james, version, into, english, 1611, efforts, to, translate, the, bible, into, english, had, their, martyrs, william, tyndale, c, 1494, 1536, was, convicted, of, heresy, at, antwerp, was, strangled, to, death, while, tied, at, the, stake, and, then, his, dead, body, was, burned, earlier, john, wycliffe, c, mid, 1320s, 1384, had, managed, to, die, a, natural, death, but, 30, years, later, the, council, of, constance, in, 1415, declared, him, a, heretic, and, decreed, that, his, works, and, earthly, remains, should, be, burned, the, order, confirmed, by, pope, martin, v, was, carried, out, in, 1428, and, wycliffe, s, corpse, was, exhumed, and, burned, and, the, ashes, cast, into, the, river, swift, debate, and, religious, schism, over, different, translations, of, religious, texts, continue, as, demonstrated, by, for, example, the, king, james, only, movement, a, famous, mistranslation, of, a, biblical, text, is, the, rendering, of, the, hebrew, word, keren, which, has, several, meanings, as, horn, in, a, context, where, it, more, plausibly, means, beam, of, light, as, a, result, for, centuries, artists, including, sculptor, michelangelo, have, rendered, moses, the, lawgiver, with, horns, growing, from, his, forehead, such, fallibility, of, the, translation, process, has, contributed, to, the, islamic, world, s, ambivalence, about, translating, the, quran, also, spelled, koran, from, the, original, arabic, as, received, by, the, prophet, muhammad, from, allah, god, through, the, angel, gabriel, incrementally, between, 609, and, 632, ce, the, year, of, muhammad, s, death, during, prayers, the, quran, as, the, miraculous, and, inimitable, word, of, allah, is, recited, only, in, arabic, however, as, of, 1936, it, had, been, translated, into, at, least, 102, languages, a, fundamental, difficulty, in, translating, the, quran, accurately, stems, from, the, fact, that, an, arabic, word, like, a, hebrew, or, aramaic, word, may, have, a, range, of, meanings, depending, on, context, this, is, said, to, be, a, linguistic, feature, particularly, of, all, semitic, languages, that, adds, to, the, usual, similar, difficulties, encountered, in, translating, between, any, two, languages, there, is, always, an, element, of, human, judgment, of, interpretation, involved, in, understanding, and, translating, a, text, muslims, regard, any, translation, of, the, quran, as, but, one, possible, interpretation, of, the, quranic, classical, arabic, text, and, not, as, a, full, equivalent, of, that, divinely, communicated, original, hence, such, a, translation, is, often, called, an, interpretation, rather, than, a, translation, to, complicate, matters, further, as, with, other, languages, the, meanings, and, usages, of, some, expressions, have, changed, over, time, between, the, classical, arabic, of, the, quran, and, modern, arabic, thus, a, modern, arabic, speaker, may, misinterpret, the, meaning, of, a, word, or, passage, in, the, quran, moreover, the, interpretation, of, a, quranic, passage, will, also, depend, on, the, historic, context, of, muhammad, s, life, and, of, his, early, community, properly, researching, that, context, requires, a, detailed, knowledge, of, hadith, and, sirah, which, are, themselves, vast, and, complex, texts, hence, analogously, to, the, translating, of, chinese, literature, an, attempt, at, an, accurate, translation, of, the, quran, requires, a, knowledge, not, only, of, the, arabic, language, and, of, the, target, language, including, their, respective, evolutions, but, also, a, deep, understanding, of, the, two, cultures, involved, experimental, literature, such, as, kathy, acker, s, novel, don, quixote, 1986, and, giannina, braschi, s, novel, yo, yo, boing, 1998, features, a, translative, writing, that, highlights, discomforts, of, the, interlingual, and, translingual, encounters, and, literary, translation, as, a, creative, practice, these, authors, weave, their, own, translations, into, their, texts, acker, s, postmodern, fiction, both, fragments, and, preserves, the, materiality, of, catullus, s, latin, text, in, ways, that, tease, out, its, semantics, and, syntax, without, wholly, appropriating, them, a, method, that, unsettles, the, notion, of, any, fixed, and, finished, translation, whereas, braschi, s, trilogy, of, experimental, works, empire, of, dreams, 1988, yo, yo, boing, 1998, and, united, states, of, banana, 2011, deals, with, the, very, subject, of, translation, her, trilogy, presents, the, evolution, of, the, spanish, language, through, loose, translations, of, dramatic, poetic, and, philosophical, writings, from, the, medieval, golden, age, and, modernist, eras, into, contemporary, caribbean, latin, american, and, nuyorican, spanish, expressions, braschi, s, translations, of, classical, texts, in, iberian, spanish, into, other, regional, and, historical, linguistic, and, poetic, frameworks, challenge, the, concept, of, national, languages, science, fiction, being, a, genre, with, a, recognizable, set, of, conventions, and, literary, genealogies, in, which, language, often, includes, neologisms, neosemes, and, invented, languages, techno, scientific, and, pseudoscientific, vocabulary, and, fictional, representation, of, the, translation, process, the, translation, of, science, fiction, texts, involves, specific, concerns, the, science, fiction, translator, tends, to, acquire, specific, competences, and, assume, a, distinctive, publishing, and, cultural, agency, as, in, the, case, of, other, mass, fiction, genres, this, professional, specialization, and, role, often, is, not, recognized, by, publishers, and, scholars, translation, of, science, fiction, accounts, for, the, transnational, nature, of, science, fiction, s, repertoire, of, shared, conventions, and, tropes, after, world, war, ii, many, european, countries, were, swept, by, a, wave, of, translations, from, the, english, due, to, the, prominence, of, english, as, a, source, language, the, use, of, pseudonyms, and, pseudotranslations, became, common, in, countries, such, as, italy, and, hungary, and, english, has, often, been, used, as, a, vehicular, language, to, translate, from, languages, such, as, chinese, and, japanese, more, recently, the, international, market, in, science, fiction, translations, has, seen, an, increasing, presence, of, source, languages, other, than, english, technical, translation, renders, documents, such, as, manuals, instruction, sheets, internal, memos, minutes, financial, reports, and, other, documents, for, a, limited, audience, who, are, directly, affected, by, the, document, and, whose, useful, life, is, often, limited, thus, a, user, guide, for, a, particular, model, of, refrigerator, is, useful, only, for, the, owner, of, the, refrigerator, and, will, remain, useful, only, as, long, as, that, refrigerator, model, is, in, use, similarly, software, documentation, generally, pertains, to, a, particular, software, whose, applications, are, used, only, by, a, certain, class, of, users, a, survey, questionnaire, consists, of, a, list, of, questions, and, answer, categories, aimed, at, extracting, data, from, a, particular, group, of, people, about, their, attitude, behavior, or, knowledge, in, cross, national, and, cross, cultural, survey, research, translation, is, crucial, to, collecting, comparable, data, originally, developed, for, the, european, social, surveys, the, model, trapd, translation, review, adjudication, pretest, and, documentation, is, now, widely, used, in, the, global, survey, research, community, although, not, always, labeled, as, such, or, implemented, in, its, complete, form, a, team, approach, is, recommended, in, the, survey, translation, process, to, include, translators, subject, matter, experts, and, persons, helpful, to, the, process, for, example, even, when, project, managers, and, researchers, do, not, speak, the, language, of, the, translation, they, know, the, study, objectives, well, and, the, intent, behind, the, questions, and, therefore, have, a, key, role, in, improving, the, translation, in, addition, a, survey, translation, framework, based, on, sociolinguistics, states, that, a, linguistically, appropriate, translation, cannot, be, wholly, sufficient, to, achieve, the, communicative, effect, of, the, source, language, survey, the, translation, must, also, incorporate, the, social, practices, and, cultural, norms, of, the, target, language
