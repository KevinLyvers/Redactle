begin, at, sundown, the, beginning, of, rosh, hashanah, is, at, sundown, at, the, end, of, 29, elul, since, the, time, of, the, destruction, of, the, second, temple, of, jerusalem, in, 70, ce, and, the, time, of, rabban, yohanan, ben, zakkai, normative, jewish, law, appears, to, be, that, rosh, hashanah, is, to, be, celebrated, for, two, days, because, of, the, difficulty, of, determining, the, date, of, the, new, moon, nonetheless, there, is, some, evidence, that, rosh, hashanah, was, celebrated, on, a, single, day, in, israel, as, late, as, the, thirteenth, century, ce, orthodox, and, conservative, judaism, now, generally, observe, rosh, hashanah, for, the, first, two, days, of, tishrei, even, in, israel, where, all, other, jewish, holidays, dated, from, the, new, moon, last, only, one, day, the, two, days, of, rosh, hashanah, are, said, to, constitute, yoma, arichtah, aramaic, one, long, day, in, reform, judaism, while, most, congregations, in, north, america, observe, only, the, first, day, of, rosh, hashanah, some, follow, the, traditional, two, day, observance, as, a, sign, of, solidarity, with, other, jews, worldwide, karaite, jews, who, do, not, recognize, rabbinic, jewish, oral, law, and, rely, on, their, own, understanding, of, the, torah, observe, only, one, day, on, the, first, of, tishrei, since, the, second, day, is, not, mentioned, in, the, written, torah, originally, the, date, of, rosh, hashanah, was, determined, based, on, observation, of, the, new, moon, molad, and, thus, could, fall, on, any, day, of, the, week, however, around, the, third, century, ce, the, hebrew, calendar, was, fixed, such, that, the, first, day, of, rosh, hashanah, never, falls, out, on, sunday, wednesday, or, friday, rosh, hashanah, occurs, 163, days, after, the, first, day, of, passover, and, thus, is, usually, but, not, always, determined, by, the, new, moon, closest, to, the, autumnal, equinox, in, terms, of, the, gregorian, calendar, the, earliest, date, on, which, rosh, hashanah, can, fall, is, 5, september, as, happened, in, 1842, 1861, 1899, and, 2013, the, latest, gregorian, date, that, rosh, hashanah, can, occur, is, 5, october, as, happened, in, 1815, 1929, and, 1967, and, will, happen, again, in, 2043, after, 2089, the, differences, between, the, hebrew, calendar, and, the, gregorian, calendar, will, result, in, rosh, hashanah, falling, no,
