cognition, is, the, mental, action, or, process, of, acquiring, knowledge, and, understanding, through, thought, experience, and, the, senses, it, encompasses, all, aspects, of, intellectual, functions, and, processes, such, as, perception, attention, thought, imagination, intelligence, the, formation, of, knowledge, memory, and, working, memory, judgment, and, evaluation, reasoning, and, computation, problem, solving, and, decision, making, comprehension, and, production, of, language, cognitive, processes, use, existing, knowledge, to, discover, new, knowledge, cognitive, processes, are, analyzed, from, different, perspectives, within, different, contexts, notably, in, the, fields, of, linguistics, musicology, anesthesia, neuroscience, psychiatry, psychology, education, philosophy, anthropology, biology, systemics, logic, and, computer, science, these, and, other, approaches, to, the, analysis, of, cognition, such, as, embodied, cognition, are, synthesized, in, the, developing, field, of, cognitive, science, a, progressively, autonomous, academic, discipline, the, word, cognition, dates, back, to, the, 15th, century, where, it, meant, thinking, and, awareness, the, term, comes, from, the, latin, noun, cognitio, examination, learning, or, knowledge, derived, from, the, verb, cognosco, a, compound, of, con, with, and, gn, sc, know, the, latter, half, gn, sc, itself, is, a, cognate, of, a, greek, verb, gi, g, n, sko, i, know, or, perceive, despite, the, word, cognitive, itself, dating, back, to, the, 15th, century, attention, to, cognitive, processes, came, about, more, than, eighteen, centuries, earlier, beginning, with, aristotle, 384, 322, bc, and, his, interest, in, the, inner, workings, of, the, mind, and, how, they, affect, the, human, experience, aristotle, focused, on, cognitive, areas, pertaining, to, memory, perception, and, mental, imagery, he, placed, great, importance, on, ensuring, that, his, studies, were, based, on, empirical, evidence, that, is, scientific, information, that, is, gathered, through, observation, and, conscientious, experimentation, two, millennia, later, the, groundwork, for, modern, concepts, of, cognition, was, laid, during, the, enlightenment, by, thinkers, such, as, john, locke, and, dugald, stewart, who, sought, to, develop, a, model, of, the, mind, in, which, ideas, were, acquired, remembered, and, manipulated, during, the, early, nineteenth, century, cognitive, models, were, developed, both, in, philosophy, particularly, by, authors, writing, about, the, philosophy, of, mind, and, within, medicine, especially, by, physicians, seeking, to, understand, how, to, cure, madness, in, britain, these, models, were, studied, in, the, academy, by, scholars, such, as, james, sully, at, university, college, london, and, they, were, even, used, by, politicians, when, considering, the, national, elementary, education, act, 1870, 33, 34, vict, c, 75, as, psychology, emerged, as, a, burgeoning, field, of, study, in, europe, whilst, also, gaining, a, following, in, america, scientists, such, as, wilhelm, wundt, herman, ebbinghaus, mary, whiton, calkins, and, william, james, would, offer, their, contributions, to, the, study, of, human, cognition, wilhelm, wundt, 1832, 1920, emphasized, the, notion, of, what, he, called, introspection, examining, the, inner, feelings, of, an, individual, with, introspection, the, subject, had, to, be, careful, with, describing, their, feelings, in, the, most, objective, manner, possible, in, order, for, wundt, to, find, the, information, scientific, though, wundt, s, contributions, are, by, no, means, minimal, modern, psychologists, find, his, methods, to, be, too, subjective, and, choose, to, rely, on, more, objective, procedures, of, experimentation, to, make, conclusions, about, the, human, cognitive, process, hermann, ebbinghaus, 1850, 1909, conducted, cognitive, studies, that, mainly, examined, the, function, and, capacity, of, human, memory, ebbinghaus, developed, his, own, experiment, in, which, he, constructed, over, 2, 000, syllables, made, out, of, nonexistent, words, for, instance, eas, he, then, examined, his, own, personal, ability, to, learn, these, non, words, he, purposely, chose, non, words, as, opposed, to, real, words, to, control, for, the, influence, of, pre, existing, experience, on, what, the, words, might, symbolize, thus, enabling, easier, recollection, of, them, ebbinghaus, observed, and, hypothesized, a, number, of, variables, that, may, have, affected, his, ability, to, learn, and, recall, the, non, words, he, created, one, of, the, reasons, he, concluded, was, the, amount, of, time, between, the, presentation, of, the, list, of, stimuli, and, the, recitation, or, recall, of, the, same, ebbinghaus, was, the, first, to, record, and, plot, a, learning, curve, and, a, forgetting, curve, his, work, heavily, influenced, the, study, of, serial, position, and, its, effect, on, memory, mary, whiton, calkins, 1863, 1930, was, an, influential, american, pioneer, in, the, realm, of, psychology, her, work, also, focused, on, human, memory, capacity, a, common, theory, called, the, recency, effect, can, be, attributed, to, the, studies, that, she, conducted, the, recency, effect, also, discussed, in, the, subsequent, experiment, section, is, the, tendency, for, individuals, to, be, able, to, accurately, recollect, the, final, items, presented, in, a, sequence, of, stimuli, calkin, s, theory, is, closely, related, to, the, aforementioned, study, and, conclusion, of, the, memory, experiments, conducted, by, hermann, ebbinghaus, william, james, 1842, 1910, is, another, pivotal, figure, in, the, history, of, cognitive, science, james, was, quite, discontent, with, wundt, s, emphasis, on, introspection, and, ebbinghaus, use, of, nonsense, stimuli, he, instead, chose, to, focus, on, the, human, learning, experience, in, everyday, life, and, its, importance, to, the, study, of, cognition, james, most, significant, contribution, to, the, study, and, theory, of, cognition, was, his, textbook, principles, of, psychology, which, preliminarily, examines, aspects, of, cognition, such, as, perception, memory, reasoning, and, attention, ren, descartes, 1596, 1650, was, a, seventeenth, century, philosopher, who, came, up, with, the, phrase, cogito, ergo, sum, which, means, i, think, therefore, i, am, he, took, a, philosophical, approach, to, the, study, of, cognition, and, the, mind, with, his, meditations, he, wanted, people, to, meditate, along, with, him, to, come, to, the, same, conclusions, as, he, did, but, in, their, own, free, cognition, in, psychology, the, term, cognition, is, usually, used, within, an, information, processing, view, of, an, individual, s, psychological, functions, and, such, is, the, same, in, cognitive, engineering, in, the, study, of, social, cognition, a, branch, of, social, psychology, the, term, is, used, to, explain, attitudes, attribution, and, group, dynamics, however, psychological, research, within, the, field, of, cognitive, science, has, also, suggested, an, embodied, approach, to, understanding, cognition, contrary, to, the, traditional, computationalist, approach, embodied, cognition, emphasizes, the, body, s, significant, role, in, the, acquisition, and, development, of, cognitive, capabilities, human, cognition, is, conscious, and, unconscious, concrete, or, abstract, as, well, as, intuitive, like, knowledge, of, a, language, and, conceptual, like, a, model, of, a, language, it, encompasses, processes, such, as, memory, association, concept, formation, pattern, recognition, language, attention, perception, action, problem, solving, and, mental, imagery, traditionally, emotion, was, not, thought, of, as, a, cognitive, process, but, now, much, research, is, being, undertaken, to, examine, the, cognitive, psychology, of, emotion, research, is, also, focused, on, one, s, awareness, of, one, s, own, strategies, and, methods, of, cognition, which, is, called, metacognition, the, concept, of, cognition, has, gone, through, several, revisions, through, the, development, of, disciplines, within, psychology, psychologists, initially, understood, cognition, governing, human, action, as, information, processing, this, was, a, movement, known, as, cognitivism, in, the, 1950s, emerging, after, the, behaviorist, movement, viewed, cognition, as, a, form, of, behavior, cognitivism, approached, cognition, as, a, form, of, computation, viewing, the, mind, as, a, machine, and, consciousness, as, an, executive, function, however, post, cognitivism, began, to, emerge, in, the, 1990s, as, the, development, of, cognitive, science, presented, theories, that, highlighted, the, necessity, of, cognitive, action, as, embodied, extended, and, producing, dynamic, processes, in, the, mind, the, development, of, cognitive, psychology, arose, as, psychology, from, different, theories, and, so, began, exploring, these, dynamics, concerning, mind, and, environment, starting, a, movement, from, these, prior, dualist, paradigms, that, prioritized, cognition, as, systematic, computation, or, exclusively, behavior, for, years, sociologists, and, psychologists, have, conducted, studies, on, cognitive, development, i, e, the, construction, of, human, thought, or, mental, processes, jean, piaget, was, one, of, the, most, important, and, influential, people, in, the, field, of, developmental, psychology, he, believed, that, humans, are, unique, in, comparison, to, animals, because, we, have, the, capacity, to, do, abstract, symbolic, reasoning, his, work, can, be, compared, to, lev, vygotsky, sigmund, freud, and, erik, erikson, who, were, also, great, contributors, in, the, field, of, developmental, psychology, piaget, is, known, for, studying, the, cognitive, development, in, children, having, studied, his, own, three, children, and, their, intellectual, development, from, which, he, would, come, to, a, theory, of, cognitive, development, that, describes, the, developmental, stages, of, childhood, studies, on, cognitive, development, have, also, been, conducted, in, children, beginning, from, the, embryonal, period, to, understand, when, cognition, appears, and, what, environmental, attributes, stimulate, the, construction, of, human, thought, or, mental, processes, research, shows, the, intentional, engagement, of, fetuses, with, the, environment, demonstrating, cognitive, achievements, however, organisms, with, simple, reflexes, cannot, cognize, the, environment, alone, because, the, environment, is, the, cacophony, of, stimuli, electromagnetic, waves, chemical, interactions, and, pressure, fluctuations, their, sensation, is, too, limited, by, the, noise, to, solve, the, cue, problem, the, relevant, stimulus, cannot, overcome, the, noise, magnitude, if, it, passes, through, the, senses, see, the, binding, problem, fetuses, need, external, help, to, stimulate, their, nervous, system, in, choosing, the, relevant, sensory, stimulus, for, grasping, the, perception, of, objects, the, shared, intentionality, approach, proposes, a, plausible, explanation, of, perception, development, in, this, earlier, stage, initially, michael, tomasello, introduced, the, psychological, construct, of, shared, intentionality, highlighting, its, contribution, to, cognitive, development, from, birth, this, primary, interaction, provides, unaware, collaboration, in, mother, child, dyads, for, environmental, learning, later, igor, val, danilov, developed, this, notion, expanding, it, to, the, intrauterine, period, and, clarifying, the, neurophysiological, processes, underlying, shared, intentionality, according, to, the, shared, intentionality, approach, the, mother, shares, the, essential, sensory, stimulus, of, the, actual, cognitive, problem, with, the, child, by, sharing, this, stimulus, the, mother, provides, a, template, for, developing, the, young, organism, s, nervous, system, recent, findings, in, research, on, child, cognitive, development, and, advances, in, inter, brain, neuroscience, experiments, have, made, the, above, proposition, plausible, based, on, them, the, shared, intentionality, hypothesis, introduced, the, notion, of, pre, perceptual, communication, in, the, mother, fetus, communication, model, due, to, nonlocal, neuronal, coupling, this, nonlocal, coupling, model, refers, to, communication, between, two, organisms, through, the, copying, of, the, adequate, ecological, dynamics, by, biological, systems, indwelling, one, environmental, context, where, a, naive, actor, fetus, replicates, information, from, an, experienced, actor, mother, due, to, intrinsic, processes, of, these, dynamic, systems, embodied, information, but, without, interacting, through, sensory, signals, the, mother, s, heartbeats, a, low, frequency, oscillator, modulate, relevant, local, neuronal, networks, in, specific, subsystems, of, both, her, and, the, nervous, system, of, the, fetus, due, to, the, effect, of, the, interference, of, the, low, frequency, oscillator, mother, heartbeats, and, already, exhibited, gamma, activity, in, these, neuronal, networks, interference, in, physics, is, the, combination, of, two, or, more, electromagnetic, waveforms, to, form, a, resultant, wave, therefore, the, subliminal, perception, in, a, fetus, emerges, due, to, shared, intentionality, with, the, mother, that, stimulates, cognition, in, this, organism, even, before, birth, another, crucial, question, in, understanding, the, beginning, of, cognition, is, memory, storage, about, the, relevant, ecological, dynamics, by, the, naive, nervous, system, i, e, memorizing, the, ecological, condition, of, relevant, sensory, stimulus, at, the, molecular, level, an, engram, evidence, derived, using, optical, imaging, molecular, genetic, and, optogenetic, techniques, in, conjunction, with, appropriate, behavioural, analyses, continues, to, offer, support, for, the, idea, that, changing, the, strength, of, connections, between, neurons, is, one, of, the, major, mechanisms, by, which, engrams, are, stored, in, the, brain, two, or, more, possible, mechanisms, of, cognition, can, involve, both, quantum, effects, and, synchronization, of, brain, structures, due, to, electromagnetic, interference, the, serial, position, effect, is, meant, to, test, a, theory, of, memory, that, states, that, when, information, is, given, in, a, serial, manner, we, tend, to, remember, information, at, the, beginning, of, the, sequence, called, the, primacy, effect, and, information, at, the, end, of, the, sequence, called, the, recency, effect, consequently, information, given, in, the, middle, of, the, sequence, is, typically, forgotten, or, not, recalled, as, easily, this, study, predicts, that, the, recency, effect, is, stronger, than, the, primacy, effect, because, the, information, that, is, most, recently, learned, is, still, in, working, memory, when, asked, to, be, recalled, information, that, is, learned, first, still, has, to, go, through, a, retrieval, process, this, experiment, focuses, on, human, memory, processes, the, word, superiority, effect, experiment, presents, a, subject, with, a, word, or, a, letter, by, itself, for, a, brief, period, of, time, i, e, 40, ms, and, they, are, then, asked, to, recall, the, letter, that, was, in, a, particular, location, in, the, word, in, theory, the, subject, should, be, better, able, to, correctly, recall, the, letter, when, it, was, presented, in, a, word, than, when, it, was, presented, in, isolation, this, experiment, focuses, on, human, speech, and, language, in, the, brown, peterson, cohomology, experiment, participants, are, briefly, presented, with, a, trigram, and, in, one, particular, version, of, the, experiment, they, are, then, given, a, distractor, task, asking, them, to, identify, whether, a, sequence, of, words, is, in, fact, words, or, non, words, due, to, being, misspelled, etc, after, the, distractor, task, they, are, asked, to, recall, the, trigram, from, before, the, distractor, task, in, theory, the, longer, the, distractor, task, the, harder, it, will, be, for, participants, to, correctly, recall, the, trigram, this, experiment, focuses, on, human, short, term, memory, during, the, memory, span, experiment, each, subject, is, presented, with, a, sequence, of, stimuli, of, the, same, kind, words, depicting, objects, numbers, letters, that, sound, similar, and, letters, that, sound, dissimilar, after, being, presented, with, the, stimuli, the, subject, is, asked, to, recall, the, sequence, of, stimuli, that, they, were, given, in, the, exact, order, in, which, it, was, given, in, one, particular, version, of, the, experiment, if, the, subject, recalled, a, list, correctly, the, list, length, was, increased, by, one, for, that, type, of, material, and, vice, versa, if, it, was, recalled, incorrectly, the, theory, is, that, people, have, a, memory, span, of, about, seven, items, for, numbers, the, same, for, letters, that, sound, dissimilar, and, short, words, the, memory, span, is, projected, to, be, shorter, with, letters, that, sound, similar, and, with, longer, words, in, one, version, of, the, visual, search, experiment, a, participant, is, presented, with, a, window, that, displays, circles, and, squares, scattered, across, it, the, participant, is, to, identify, whether, there, is, a, green, circle, on, the, window, in, the, featured, search, the, subject, is, presented, with, several, trial, windows, that, have, blue, squares, or, circles, and, one, green, circle, or, no, green, circle, in, it, at, all, in, the, conjunctive, search, the, subject, is, presented, with, trial, windows, that, have, blue, circles, or, green, squares, and, a, present, or, absent, green, circle, whose, presence, the, participant, is, asked, to, identify, what, is, expected, is, that, in, the, feature, searches, reaction, time, that, is, the, time, it, takes, for, a, participant, to, identify, whether, a, green, circle, is, present, or, not, should, not, change, as, the, number, of, distractors, increases, conjunctive, searches, where, the, target, is, absent, should, have, a, longer, reaction, time, than, the, conjunctive, searches, where, the, target, is, present, the, theory, is, that, in, feature, searches, it, is, easy, to, spot, the, target, or, if, it, is, absent, because, of, the, difference, in, color, between, the, target, and, the, distractors, in, conjunctive, searches, where, the, target, is, absent, reaction, time, increases, because, the, subject, has, to, look, at, each, shape, to, determine, whether, it, is, the, target, or, not, because, some, of, the, distractors, if, not, all, of, them, are, the, same, color, as, the, target, stimuli, conjunctive, searches, where, the, target, is, present, take, less, time, because, if, the, target, is, found, the, search, between, each, shape, stops, the, semantic, network, of, knowledge, representation, systems, have, been, studied, in, various, paradigms, one, of, the, oldest, paradigms, is, the, leveling, and, sharpening, of, stories, as, they, are, repeated, from, memory, studied, by, bartlett, the, semantic, differential, used, factor, analysis, to, determine, the, main, meanings, of, words, finding, that, the, ethical, value, of, words, is, the, first, factor, more, controlled, experiments, examine, the, categorical, relationships, of, words, in, free, recall, the, hierarchical, structure, of, words, has, been, explicitly, mapped, in, george, miller, s, wordnet, more, dynamic, models, of, semantic, networks, have, been, created, and, tested, with, computational, systems, such, as, neural, networks, latent, semantic, analysis, lsa, bayesian, analysis, and, multidimensional, factor, analysis, the, meanings, of, words, are, studied, by, all, the, disciplines, of, cognitive, science, metacognition, is, an, awareness, of, one, s, thought, processes, and, an, understanding, of, the, patterns, behind, them, the, term, comes, from, the, root, word, meta, meaning, beyond, or, on, top, of, metacognition, can, take, many, forms, such, as, reflecting, on, one, s, ways, of, thinking, and, knowing, when, and, how, oneself, and, others, use, particular, strategies, for, problem, solving, there, are, generally, two, components, of, metacognition, 1, cognitive, conceptions, and, 2, cognitive, regulation, system, research, has, shown, that, both, components, of, metacognition, play, key, roles, in, metaconceptual, knowledge, and, learning, metamemory, defined, as, knowing, about, memory, and, mnemonic, strategies, is, an, important, aspect, of, metacognition, aerobic, and, anaerobic, exercise, have, been, studied, concerning, cognitive, improvement, there, appear, to, be, short, term, increases, in, attention, span, verbal, and, visual, memory, in, some, studies, however, the, effects, are, transient, and, diminish, over, time, after, cessation, of, the, physical, activity, people, with, parkinson, s, disease, has, also, seen, improved, cognition, while, cycling, while, pairing, it, with, other, cognitive, tasks, studies, evaluating, phytoestrogen, blueberry, supplementation, and, antioxidants, showed, minor, increases, in, cognitive, function, after, supplementation, but, no, significant, effects, compared, to, placebo, another, study, on, the, effects, of, herbal, and, dietary, supplements, on, cognition, in, menopause, show, that, soy, and, ginkgo, biloba, supplementation, could, improve, women, s, cognition, exposing, individuals, with, cognitive, impairment, i, e, dementia, to, daily, activities, designed, to, stimulate, thinking, and, memory, in, a, social, setting, seems, to, improve, cognition, although, study, materials, are, small, and, larger, studies, need, to, confirm, the, results, the, effect, of, social, cognitive, stimulation, seems, to, be, larger, than, the, effects, of, some, drug, treatments, transcranial, magnetic, stimulation, tms, has, been, shown, to, improve, cognition, in, individuals, without, dementia, 1, month, after, treatment, session, compared, to, before, treatment, the, effect, was, not, significantly, larger, compared, to, placebo, computerized, cognitive, training, utilizing, a, computer, based, training, regime, for, different, cognitive, functions, has, been, examined, in, a, clinical, setting, but, no, lasting, effects, has, been, shown
