this, portion, is, similar, to, a, percentage, but, may, be, limited, or, expanded, by, a, number, of, factors, such, as, free, goods, recoupable, expenses, bonuses, etc, that, are, specified, by,

in, the, hopes, that, it, will, help, promote, the, sale, of, recordings, however, in, the, 21st, century, it, has, become, more, common, to, release, recordings, to, promote, ticket, sales, for, live, shows, rather, than, book, tours, to, promote, the, sales, of, recordings, major, successful, artists, will, usually, employ, a, road, crew, a, semi, permanent, touring, organization, that,

merchandise, personal, endorsements, appearances, without, performing, at, events, or, internet, based, services, these, are, typically, overseen, by, the, artist, s, manager, and, take, the, form, of, relationships, between, the, artist, and, companies, that, specialize, in, these, products, singers, may, also, hire, a, vocal, coach, dance, instructor, acting, coach, personal, trainer, or,

computer, companies, such, as, apple, computer, have, become, digital, music, retailers, new, digital, music, distribution, technologies, and, the, trends, towards, using, sampling, of, older, songs, in, new, songs, or, blending, different, songs, to, create, mashup, recordings, have, also, forced, both, governments, and, the, music, industry, to, re, examine, the, definitions, of, intellectual, property, and, the, rights, of, all, the, parties, involved, also, compounding, the, issue, of, defining, copyright, boundaries, is, the, fact, that, the, definition, of, royalty, and, copyright, varies, from, country, to, country, and, region, to, region, which, changes, the, terms, of, some, of, these, business, relationships, after, 15, or, so, years, of, the, internet, economy, the, digital, music, industry, platforms, like, itunes, spotify, and, google, play, are, major, improvements, over, the, early, illegal, file, sharing, days, however, the, multitude, of, service, offerings, and, revenue, models, make, it, difficult, to, understand, the, true, value, of, each, and, what, they, can, deliver, for, musicians, and, music, companies, as, well, there, are, major, transparency, problems, throughout, the, music, industry, caused, by, outdated, technology, with, the, emerging, of, new, business, models, as, streaming, platforms, and, online, music, services, a, large, amount, of, data, is, processed, access, to, big, data, may, increase, transparency, in, the, industry, music, publishing, using, machine, printed, sheet, music, developed, during, the, renaissance, music, era, in, the, mid, 15th, century, the, development, of, music, publication, followed, the, evolution, of, printing, technologies, that, were, first, developed, for, printing, regular, books, after, the, mid, 15th, century, mechanical, techniques, for, printing, sheet, music, were, first, developed, the, earliest, example, a, set, of, liturgical, chants, dates, from, about, 1465, shortly, after, the, gutenberg, bible, was, printed, prior, to, this, time, music, had, to, be, copied, out, by, hand, to, copy, music, notation, by, hand, was, a, very, costly, labor, intensive, and, time, consuming, process, so, it, was, usually, undertaken, only, by, monks, and, priests, seeking, to, preserve, sacred, music, for, the, church, the, few, collections, of, secular, non, religious, music, that, are, extant, were, commissioned, and, owned, by, wealthy, aristocrats, examples, include, the, squarcialupi, codex, of, italian, trecento, music, and, the, chantilly, codex, of, french, ars, subtilior, music, the, use, of, printing, enabled, sheet, music, to, reproduced, much, more, quickly, and, at, a, much, lower, cost, than, hand, copying, music, notation, this, helped, musical, styles, to, spread, to, other, cities, and, countries, more, quickly, and, it, also, enabled, music, to, be, spread, to, more, distant, areas, before, the, invention, of, music, printing, a, composer, s, music, might, only, be, known, in, the, city, she, lived, in, and, its, surrounding, towns, because, only, wealthy, aristocrats, would, be, able, to, afford, to, have, hand, copies, made, of, her, music, with, music, printing, though, a, composer, s, music, could, be, printed, and, sold, at, a, relatively, low, cost, to, purchasers, from, a, wide, geographic, area, as, sheet, music, of, major, composer, s, pieces, and, songs, began, to, be, printed, and, distributed, in, a, wider, area, this, enabled, composers, and, listeners, to, hear, new, styles, and, forms, of, music, a, german, composer, could, buy, songs, written, by, an, italian, or, english, composer, and, an, italian, composer, could, buy, pieces, written, by, dutch, composers, and, learn, how, they, wrote, music, this, led, to, more, blending, of, musical, styles, from, different, countries, and, regions, the, pioneer, of, modern, music, printing, was, ottaviano, petrucci, born, in, fossombrone, in, 1466, died, in, 1539, in, venice, a, printer, and, publisher, who, was, able, to, secure, a, twenty, year, monopoly, on, printed, music, in, venice, during, the, 16th, century, venice, was, one, of, the, major, business, and, music, centers, during, this, period, his, harmonice, musices, odhecaton, a, collection, of, chansons, printed, in, 1501, is, commonly, misidentified, as, the, first, book, of, sheet, music, printed, from, movable, type, that, distinction, belongs, to, the, roman, printer, ulrich, han, s, missale, romanum, of, 1476, nevertheless, petrucci, s, later, work, was, extraordinary, for, the, complexity, of, his, white, mensural, notation, and, the, smallness, of, his, font, he, printed, the, first, book, of, polyphony, music, with, two, or, more, independent, melodic, lines, using, movable, type, he, also, published, numerous, works, by, the, most, highly, regarded, composers, of, the, renaissance, including, josquin, des, prez, and, antoine, brumel, he, flourished, by, focusing, on, flemish, works, rather, than, italian, as, they, were, very, popular, throughout, europe, during, the, renaissance, music, era, his, printing, shop, used, the, triple, impression, method, in, which, a, sheet, of, paper, was, pressed, three, times, the, first, impression, was, the, staff, lines, the, second, the, words, and, the, third, the, notes, this, method, produced, very, clean, and, readable, results, although, it, was, time, consuming, and, expensive, until, the, 18th, century, the, processes, of, formal, composition, and, of, the, printing, of, music, took, place, for, the, most, part, with, the, support, of, patronage, from, aristocracies, and, churches, in, the, mid, to, late, 18th, century, performers, and, composers, such, as, wolfgang, amadeus, mozart, began, to, seek, more, commercial, opportunities, to, market, their, music, and, performances, to, the, general, public, after, mozart, s, death, his, wife, constanze, weber, continued, the, process, of, commercialization, of, his, music, through, an, unprecedented, series, of, memorial, concerts, selling, his, manuscripts, and, collaborating, with, her, second, husband, georg, nissen, on, a, biography, of, mozart, in, the, 19th, century, sheet, music, publishers, dominated, the, music, industry, before, the, invention, of, sound, recording, technologies, the, main, way, for, music, lovers, to, hear, new, symphonies, and, opera, arias, songs, was, to, buy, the, sheet, music, often, arranged, for, piano, or, for, a, small, chamber, music, group, and, perform, the, music, in, a, living, room, using, friends, who, were, amateur, musicians, and, singers, in, the, united, states, the, music, industry, arose, in, tandem, with, the, rise, of, black, face, minstrelsy, blackface, is, a, form, of, theatrical, makeup, used, predominantly, by, non, black, performers, to, represent, a, black, person, the, practice, gained, popularity, during, the, 19th, century, and, contributed, to, the, spread, of, negative, racial, stereotypes, of, african, american, people, in, the, late, part, of, the, century, the, group, of, music, publishers, and, songwriters, which, dominated, popular, music, in, the, united, states, became, known, as, tin, pan, alley, the, name, originally, referred, to, a, specific, place, west, 28th, street, between, fifth, and, sixth, avenue, in, manhattan, and, a, plaque, see, below, on, the, sidewalk, on, 28th, street, between, broadway, and, sixth, commemorates, it, the, start, of, tin, pan, alley, is, usually, dated, to, about, 1885, when, several, music, publishers, set, up, shop, in, the, same, district, of, manhattan, the, end, of, tin, pan, alley, is, less, clear, cut, some, date, it, to, the, start, of, the, great, depression, in, the, 1930s, when, the, phonograph, and, radio, supplanted, sheet, music, as, the, driving, force, of, american, popular, music, while, others, consider, tin, pan, alley, to, have, continued, into, the, 1950s, when, earlier, styles, of, american, popular, music, were, upstaged, by, the, rise, of, rock, roll, at, the, dawn, of, the, early, 20th, century, the, development, of, sound, recording, began, to, function, as, a, disruptive, technology, to, the, commercial, interests, which, published, sheet, music, during, the, sheet, music, era, if, a, regular, person, wanted, to, hear, popular, new, songs, he, or, she, would, buy, the, sheet, music, and, play, it, at, home, on, a, piano, or, learn, the, song, at, home, while, playing, the, accompaniment, part, on, piano, or, guitar, commercially, released, phonograph, records, of, musical, performances, which, became, available, starting, in, the, late, 1880s, and, later, the, onset, of, widespread, radio, broadcasting, starting, in, the, 1920s, forever, changed, the, way, music, was, heard, and, listened, to, opera, houses, concert, halls, and, clubs, continued, to, produce, music, and, musicians, and, singers, continued, to, perform, live, but, the, power, of, radio, allowed, bands, ensembles, and, singers, who, had, previously, performed, only, in, one, region, to, become, popular, on, a, nationwide, and, sometimes, even, a, worldwide, scale, moreover, whereas, attendance, at, the, top, symphony, and, opera, concerts, was, formerly, restricted, to, high, income, people, in, a, pre, radio, world, with, broadcast, radio, a, much, larger, wider, range, of, people, including, lower, and, middle, income, people, could, hear, the, best, orchestras, big, bands, popular, singers, and, opera, shows, the, record, industry, eventually, replaced, the, sheet, music, publishers, as, the, music, industry, s, largest, force, a, multitude, of, record, labels, came, and, went, some, noteworthy, labels, of, the, earlier, decades, include, the, columbia, records, crystalate, decca, records, edison, bell, the, gramophone, company, invicta, kalliope, path, victor, talking, machine, company, and, many, others, many, record, companies, died, out, as, quickly, as, they, had, formed, and, by, the, end, of, the, 1980s, the, big, six, emi, cbs, bmg, polygram, wea, and, mca, dominated, the, industry, sony, bought, cbs, records, in, 1987, and, changed, its, name, to, sony, music, in, 1991, in, mid, 1998, polygram, music, group, merged, with, mca, music, entertainment, creating, what, we, now, know, as, universal, music, group, since, then, sony, and, bmg, merged, in, 2004, and, universal, took, over, the, majority, of, emi, s, recorded, music, interests, in, 2012, emi, music, publishing, also, once, part, of, the, now, defunct, british, conglomerate, is, now, co, owned, by, sony, as, a, subsidiary, of, sony, atv, music, publishing, as, in, other, industries, the, record, industry, is, characterised, by, many, mergers, and, or, acquisitions, for, the, major, companies, as, well, as, for, middle, sized, business, recent, example, is, given, by, the, belgium, group, pias, and, french, group, harmonia, mundi, genre, wise, music, entrepreneurs, expanded, their, industry, models, into, areas, like, folk, music, in, which, composition, and, performance, had, continued, for, centuries, on, an, ad, hoc, self, supporting, basis, forming, an, independent, record, label, or, indie, label, or, signing, to, such, a, label, continues, to, be, a, popular, choice, for, up, and, coming, musicians, especially, in, genres, like, hardcore, punk, and, extreme, metal, even, though, indies, cannot, offer, the, same, financial, backing, of, major, labels, some, bands, prefer, to, sign, with, an, indie, label, because, these, labels, typically, give, performers, more, artistic, freedom, in, the, first, decade, of, the, 2000s, digitally, downloaded, and, streamed, music, became, more, popular, than, buying, physical, recordings, e, g, cds, records, and, tapes, this, gave, consumers, almost, friction, less, access, to, a, wider, variety, of, music, than, ever, before, across, multiple, devices, at, the, same, time, consumers, spent, less, money, on, recorded, music, both, physically, and, digitally, distributed, than, they, had, in, the, 1990s, total, music, business, revenues, in, the, u, s, dropped, by, half, from, a, high, of, 14, 6, billion, in, 1999, to, 6, 3, billion, in, 2009, according, to, forrester, research, worldwide, revenues, for, cds, vinyl, cassettes, and, digital, downloads, fell, from, 36, 9, billion, in, 2000, to, 15, 9, billion, in, 2010, according, to, ifpi, the, economist, and, the, new, york, times, reported, that, the, downward, trend, was, expected, to, continue, for, the, foreseeable, future, this, dramatic, decline, in, revenue, has, caused, large, scale, layoffs, inside, the, industry, driven, some, more, venerable, retailers, such, as, tower, records, out, of, business, and, forced, record, companies, record, producers, studios, recording, engineers, and, musicians, to, seek, new, business, models, in, response, to, the, rise, of, widespread, illegal, file, sharing, of, digital, music, recordings, the, record, industry, took, aggressive, legal, action, in, 2001, it, succeeded, in, shutting, down, the, popular, music, website, napster, and, threatened, legal, action, against, thousands, of, individuals, who, participated, in, sharing, music, song, sound, files, however, this, failed, to, slow, the, decline, in, music, recording, revenue, and, proved, a, public, relations, disaster, for, the, music, industry, some, academic, studies, have, even, suggested, that, downloads, did, not, cause, the, decline, in, sales, of, recordings, the, 2008, british, music, rights, survey, showed, that, 80, of, people, in, britain, wanted, a, legal, peer, to, peer, p2p, file, sharing, service, however, only, half, of, the, respondents, thought, that, the, music, s, creators, should, be, paid, the, survey, was, consistent, with, the, results, of, earlier, research, conducted, in, the, united, states, upon, which, the, open, music, model, was, based, legal, digital, downloads, became, widely, available, with, the, debut, of, the, apple, itunes, store, in, 2003, the, popularity, of, music, distribution, over, the, internet, has, increased, and, by, 2011, digital, music, sales, topped, physical, sales, of, music, in, 2008, atlantic, records, reports, that, digital, sales, have, surpassed, physical, sales, however, as, the, economist, reported, paid, digital, downloads, grew, rapidly, but, did, not, begin, to, make, up, for, the, loss, of, revenue, from, cds, after, 2010, internet, based, services, such, as, deezer, pandora, spotify, and, apple, s, itunes, radio, began, to, offer, subscription, based, pay, to, stream, services, over, the, internet, with, streaming, services, the, user, pays, a, subscription, to, a, company, for, the, right, to, listen, to, songs, and, other, media, from, a, library, whereas, with, legal, digital, download, services, the, purchaser, owns, a, digital, copy, of, the, song, which, they, can, keep, on, their, computer, or, on, a, digital, media, player, with, streaming, services, the, user, never, downloads, the, song, file, or, owns, the, song, file, the, subscriber, can, only, listen, to, the, song, for, as, long, as, they, continue, to, pay, the, streaming, subscription, once, the, user, stops, paying, the, subscription, they, cannot, listen, to, audio, from, the, company, s, repositories, anymore, streaming, services, began, to, have, a, serious, impact, on, the, industry, in, 2014, spotify, together, with, the, music, streaming, industry, in, general, faces, some, criticism, from, artists, claiming, they, are, not, being, fairly, compensated, for, their, work, as, downloaded, music, sales, decline, and, music, streaming, increases, unlike, physical, or, download, sales, which, pay, a, fixed, price, per, song, or, album, spotify, pays, artists, based, on, their, market, share, the, number, of, streams, for, their, songs, as, a, proportion, of, total, songs, streamed, on, the, service, spotify, distributes, approximately, 70, to, rights, holders, who, will, then, pay, artists, based, on, their, agreements, the, variable, and, some, say, inadequate, nature, of, this, compensation, has, led, to, criticism, spotify, reports, paying, on, average, us, 0, 006, to, us, 0, 008, per, stream, in, response, to, concerns, spotify, claims, that, they, are, benefiting, the, music, business, by, migrating, them, away, from, piracy, and, less, monetized, platforms, and, allowing, them, to, generate, far, greater, royalties, than, before, by, encouraging, users, to, use, their, paid, service, the, recording, industry, association, of, america, riaa, revealed, in, its, 2015, earnings, report, that, streaming, services, were, responsible, for, 34, 3, percent, of, the, year, s, u, s, recorded, music, industry, revenue, growing, 29, percent, from, the, previous, year, and, becoming, the, largest, source, of, income, pulling, in, around, 2, 4, billion, us, streaming, revenue, grew, 57, percent, to, 1, 6, billion, in, the, first, half, of, 2016, and, accounted, for, almost, half, of, industry, sales, this, contrasts, with, the, 14, 6, billion, in, revenue, that, was, received, in, 1999, by, the, u, s, music, industry, from, the, sale, of, cds, the, turmoil, in, the, recorded, music, industry, in, the, 2000s, altered, the, twentieth, century, balance, between, artists, record, companies, promoters, retail, music, stores, and, consumers, as, of, 2010, big, box, stores, such, as, wal, mart, and, best, buy, sell, more, records, than, music, only, cd, stores, which, have, ceased, to, function, as, a, major, player, in, the, music, industry, music, performing, artists, now, rely, on, live, performance, and, merchandise, sales, t, shirts, sweatshirts, etc, for, the, majority, of, their, income, which, in, turn, has, made, them, more, dependent, like, pre, 20th, century, musicians, on, patrons, now, exemplified, by, music, promoters, such, as, live, nation, which, dominates, tour, promotion, and, owns, or, manages, a, large, number, of, music, venues, in, order, to, benefit, from, all, of, an, artist, s, income, streams, record, companies, increasingly, rely, on, the, 360, deal, a, new, business, relationship, pioneered, by, robbie, williams, and, emi, in, 2007, at, the, other, extreme, record, companies, can, offer, a, simple, manufacturing, and, distribution, deal, which, gives, a, higher, percentage, to, the, artist, but, does, not, cover, the, expenses, of, marketing, and, promotion, companies, like, kickstarter, help, independent, musicians, produce, their, albums, through, fans, funding, bands, they, want, to, listen, to, many, newer, artists, no, longer, see, a, record, deal, as, an, integral, part, of, their, business, plan, at, all, inexpensive, recording, hardware, and, software, make, it, possible, to, record, reasonable, quality, music, on, a, laptop, in, a, bedroom, and, to, distribute, it, over, the, internet, to, a, worldwide, audience, this, in, turn, has, caused, problems, for, recording, studios, record, producers, and, audio, engineers, the, los, angeles, times, reports, that, as, many, as, half, of, the, recording, facilities, in, that, city, have, failed, changes, in, the, music, industry, have, given, consumers, access, to, a, wider, variety, of, music, than, ever, before, at, a, price, that, gradually, approaches, zero, however, consumer, spending, on, music, related, software, and, hardware, increased, dramatically, over, the, last, decade, providing, a, valuable, new, income, stream, for, technology, companies, such, as, apple, inc, and, pandora, radio,

artists, are, signed, directly, to, the, major, label, these, companies, account, for, more, than, half, of, us, market, share, however, this, has, fallen, somewhat, in, recent, years, as, the, new, digital, environment, allows, smaller, labels, to, compete, more, effectively, total, album, sales, have, declined, in, the, early, decades, of, the, 21st, century, leading, some, music, critics, to,

this, number, grew, to, approximately, 27, in, 2007, the, growth, is, attributed, to, increasing, on, line, sales, of, used, product, by, outlets, such, as, amazon, com, the, growth, of, used, music,
