autonomy, and, equal, access, to, certain, public, goods, and, social, services, social, equality, requires, the, absence, of, legally, enforced, social, class, or, caste, boundaries, and, the, absence, of, discrimination, motivated, by, an, inalienable, part, of, an, individual, s, identity, for, example, advocates, of, social, equality, believe, in, equality, before, the, law, for, all, individuals, regardless, of, sex, gender, ethnicity, age, sexual, orientation, origin, caste, or, class, income, or, property, language, religion, convictions, opinions, health, or, disability, there, are, different, types, of, social, equality, social, equality, is, variously, defined, and, measured, by, different, schools, of, thought, these, include, equality, of, power, rights, goods, opportunities, capabilities, or, some, combination, of, these, things, it, may, also, be, defined, in, comparison, to, distributive, equality, power, structures, between, individuals, or, justice, and, political, egalitarianism, societies, that, promote, social, equality, generally, do, not, make, distinctions, of, rank, or, social, class, and, interpersonal, relationships, under, a, system, of, social, equality, are, generally, based, on, the, idea, of, mutual, respect, and, equal, value, rather, than, hierarchy, or, honour, many, different, ideologies, draw, from, ideas, of, social, equality, including, communism, anarchism, multiculturalism, republicanism, democracy, socialism, and, social, democracy, the, advocacy, of, social, equality, is, egalitarianism, social, equality, is, distinct, from, alleviating, suffering, of, the, unfortunate, in, society, it, is, an, expression, of, the, ideal, that, any, two, individuals, in, society, should, be, treated, with, equal, respect, and, have, an, equal, right, to, participate, in, society, without, regard, for, social, status, or, hierarchy, social, equality, often, pertains, to, how, individuals, relate, to, one, another, within, a, society, though, it, can, also, be, considered, in, interactions, between, societies, social, hierarchies, may, form, between, states, or, their, citizens, when, power, disparities, exist, between, them, particularly, in, the, context, of, globalization, these, disparities, are, often, distinct, in, type, as, well, as, scope, as, citizens, in, different, states, do, not, share, a, common, community, or, social, environment, as, advances, are, made, in, social, equality, both, internationally, and, within, a, society, the, scope, of, social, equality, expands, as, new, forms, of, social, inequality, become, apparent, and, new, solutions, become, possible, illustrating, the, combat, fought, in, favour, of, this, application, on, many, fronts, are, the, following, episodes, early, conceptions, of, social, equality, appear, in, ancient, greek, philosophy, the, stoic, philosophers, believed, that, human, reason, is, universal, plato, considered, the, natures, of, equality, when, building, society, in, the, republic, including, both, a, monastic, equality, and, equality, in, depravity, aristotle, also, developed, a, conception, of, equality, particularly, regarding, citizenship, though, he, rejected, the, concept, of, total, social, equality, in, favour, of, social, hierarchy, social, equality, developed, as, a, practicable, element, of, society, in, europe, during, the, reformation, in, which, traditional, religious, hierarchies, were, challenged, the, development, of, post, reformation, political, philosophy, provided, a, secular, foundation, for, social, equality, and, political, science, created, empirical, systems, to, analyze, social, equality, in, practice, the, contemporary, notion, of, social, equality, was, developed, in, the, 20th, century, by, political, philosophers, such, as, john, rawls, ronald, dworkin, and, amartya, sen, rawls, defined, equality, through, primary, goods, like, liberty, opportunity, respect, and, wealth, dworkin, incorporated, a, concept, of, responsibility, into, rawls, approach, saying, that, individuals, are, personally, responsible, for, voluntary, decisions, but, not, natural, talents, or, pre, dispositions, sen, rejected, rawls, measurement, of, resources, in, favour, of, the, capability, to, function, robert, nozick, is, known, for, rejecting, rawls, conception, of, social, equality, arguing, that, the, individual, who, produced, a, resource, is, entitled, to, it, even, if, this, produces, unequal, results, social, equality, is, a, major, element, of, equality, for, any, group, in, society, gender, equality, includes, social, equality, between, men, women, and, intersex, people, whether, transgender, or, cisgender, internationally, women, are, harmed, significantly, more, by, a, lack, of, gender, equality, resulting, in, a, higher, risk, of, poverty, racial, equality, and, ethnic, equality, include, social, equality, between, people, of, different, races, and, ethnic, origins, social, equality, can, also, be, applied, to, belief, and, ideology, including, equal, social, status, for, people, of, all, political, or, religious, beliefs, the, rights, of, people, with, disabilities, pertain, to, social, equality, both, physical, and, mental, disabilities, can, prevent, individuals, from, participating, in, society, at, an, equal, level, due, to, environmental, factors, as, well, as, stigmas, associated, with, disability, social, equality, includes, both, the, treatment, of, disabilities, and, the, accommodation, of, people, with, disabilities, to, facilitate, equal, participation, in, society, economic, development, and, industrialization, are, correlated, with, increased, social, equality, the, industrialization, process, in, which, a, developing, country, becomes, a, developed, country, corresponds, to, a, significant, increase, in, social, equality, and, further, economic, development, and, growth, in, developed, countries, corresponds, with, further, increases, in, social, equality, education, and, social, equality, are, also, correlated, and, increased, access, to, education, promotes, social, equality, among, individuals, the, standard, of, equality, that, states, everyone, is, created, equal, at, birth, is, called, ontological, equality, this, type, of, equality, can, be, seen, in, many, places, like, the, united, states, declaration, of, independence, this, early, document, which, states, many, of, the, values, of, the, united, states, of, america, has, this, idea, of, equality, embedded, in, it, it, says, all, men, are, created, equal, that, they, are, endowed, by, their, creator, with, certain, unalienable, rights, the, statement, reflects, the, philosophy, of, john, locke, and, his, idea, that, all, are, equal, in, terms, of, certain, natural, rights, although, this, standard, of, equality, is, seen, in, documents, as, important, as, the, declaration, of, independence, it, is, one, not, often, invoked, in, policy, debates, these, days, another, standard, of, equality, is, equality, of, opportunity, the, idea, that, everyone, has, an, equal, chance, to, achieve, wealth, social, prestige, and, power, because, the, rules, of, the, game, so, to, speak, are, the, same, for, everyone, this, concept, can, be, applied, to, society, by, saying, that, no, one, has, a, head, start, this, means, that, for, any, social, equality, issue, dealing, with, wealth, social, prestige, power, or, any, of, that, sort, the, equality, of, opportunity, standard, can, defend, the, idea, that, everyone, had, the, same, start, this, views, society, almost, as, a, game, and, any, of, the, differences, in, equality, standards, are, due, to, luck, and, playing, the, game, to, one, s, best, ability, formal, equality, refers, to, equal, opportunity, for, individuals, based, on, merit, while, substantive, equality, reforms, to, equality, of, outcomes, for, groups, lesley, a, jacobs, the, author, of, pursuing, equal, opportunities, the, theory, and, practice, of, egalitarian, justice, talks, about, equality, of, opportunity, and, its, importance, relating, to, egalitarian, justice, jacobs, states, that, at, the, core, of, equality, of, opportunity, is, the, concept, that, in, competitive, procedures, designed, for, the, allocation, of, scarce, resources, and, the, distribution, of, the, benefits, and, burdens, of, social, life, those, procedures, should, be, governed, by, criteria, that, are, relevant, to, the, particular, goods, at, stake, in, the, competition, and, not, by, irrelevant, considerations, such, as, race, religion, class, gender, disability, sexual, orientation, ethnicity, or, other, factors, that, may, hinder, some, of, the, competitors, opportunities, at, success, jacobs, 10, this, concept, points, out, factors, like, race, gender, class, etc, that, should, not, be, considered, when, talking, about, equality, through, this, notion, conley, also, mentions, that, this, standard, of, equality, is, at, the, heart, of, a, bourgeois, society, such, as, a, modern, capitalist, society, or, a, society, of, commerce, in, which, the, maximization, of, profit, is, the, primary, business, incentive, it, was, the, equal, opportunity, ideology, that, civil, rights, activists, adopted, in, the, era, of, the, civil, rights, movement, in, the, 1960s, this, ideology, was, used, by, them, to, argue, that, jim, crow, laws, were, incompatible, with, the, standard, of, equality, of, opportunity, another, notion, of, equality, introduced, by, conley, is, equality, of, condition, through, this, framework, is, the, idea, that, everyone, should, have, an, equal, starting, point, conley, goes, back, to, his, example, of, a, game, of, monopoly, to, explain, this, standard, if, the, game, of, four, started, with, two, players, both, having, an, advantage, of, 5, 000, to, start, with, and, both, already, owning, hotels, and, other, property, while, the, other, two, players, both, did, not, own, any, property, and, both, started, with, a, 5, 000, deficit, then, from, a, perspective, of, the, standard, of, equality, of, condition, one, can, argue, that, the, rules, of, the, game, need, to, be, altered, to, compensate, for, inequalities, in, the, relative, starting, positions, from, this, we, form, policies, to, even, equality, which, in, result, bring, an, efficient, way, to, create, fairer, competition, in, society, here, is, where, social, engineering, comes, into, play, where, we, change, society, to, give, an, equality, of, condition, to, everyone, based, on, race, gender, class, religion, etc, when, it, is, made, justifiable, that, the, proponents, of, the, society, make, it, unfair, for, them, sharon, e, kahn, the, author, of, academic, freedom, and, the, inclusive, university, talks, about, equality, of, condition, in, their, work, as, well, and, how, it, correlates, to, freedom, of, individuals, kahn, claims, that, in, order, to, have, individual, freedom, there, needs, to, be, equality, of, condition, which, requires, much, more, than, the, elimination, of, legal, barriers, it, requires, the, creation, of, a, level, playing, field, that, eliminates, structural, barriers, to, opportunity, her, work, refers, to, academic, structure, and, its, problem, with, equalities, and, claims, that, to, ensure, equity, we, need, to, recognize, that, the, university, structure, and, its, organizational, culture, have, traditionally, privileged, some, and, marginalized, other, we, need, to, go, beyond, theoretical, concepts, of, equality, by, eliminating, systemic, barriers, that, hinder, the, equal, participation, of, members, of, all, groups, we, need, to, create, and, equality, of, condition, not, merely, an, equality, of, opportunity, notions, of, equity, diversity, and, inclusiveness, begin, with, a, set, of, premises, about, individualism, freedom, and, rights, that, take, as, given, the, existence, of, deeply, rooted, inequalities, in, social, structure, therefore, in, order, to, have, a, culture, of, the, inclusive, university, it, would, have, to, be, based, on, values, of, equity, that, is, equality, of, condition, eliminating, all, systemic, barriers, that, go, against, equality, the, fourth, standard, of, equality, is, equality, of, outcome, which, is, a, position, that, argues, each, player, must, end, up, with, the, same, amount, regardless, of, the, fairness, in, this, standard, of, equality, the, idea, is, that, everyone, contributes, to, society, and, the, economy, according, to, what, they, do, best, under, this, notion, of, equality, conley, states, that, nobody, will, earn, more, power, prestige, and, wealth, by, working, harder, equality, of, outcome, is, often, falsely, conflated, with, communism, or, marxist, philosophy, even, though, these, ideologies, promote, the, distribution, of, resources, based, on, need, or, contribution, depending, on, the, level, of, development, of, a, society, s, productive, forces, rather, than, equality, vladimir, lenin, stated, that, the, abolition, of, classes, means, placing, all, citizens, on, an, equal, footing, about, the, means, of, production, belonging, to, society, as, a, whole, it, means, giving, all, citizens, equal, opportunities, of, working, on, the, publicly, owned, means, of, production, on, the, publicly, owned, land, at, the, publicly, owned, factories, and, so, forth, when, defining, equality, of, outcome, in, education, the, goals, should, not, be, the, liberal, one, of, equality, of, access, but, equality, of, outcome, for, the, median, number, of, each, identifiable, non, educationally, defined, group, i, e, the, average, women, negro, or, proletarian, or, rural, dweller, should, have, the, same, level, of, educational, attainment, as, the, average, male, white, suburbanite, the, outcome, and, the, benefits, from, equality, from, education, from, this, notion, of, equality, promotes, that, all, should, have, the, same, outcomes, and, benefits, regardless, of, race, gender, religion, etc, the, equality, of, outcome, in, hewitt, s, point, of, view, is, supposed, to, result, in, a, comparable, range, of, achievements, between, a, specific, disadvantaged, group, such, as, an, ethnic, minority, women, lone, parents, and, the, disabled, and, society, as, a, whole, information, ethics, is, impartial, and, universal, because, it, brings, to, ultimate, completion, the, process, of, enlargement, of, the, concept, of, what, may, count, as, a, centre, of, a, no, matter, how, minimal, moral, claim, which, now, includes, every, instance, of, being, understood, informationally, no, matter, whether, physically, implemented, or, not, in, this, respect, information, ethics, holds, that, every, entity, as, an, expression, of, being, has, a, dignity, constituted, by, its, mode, of, existence, and, essence, the, collection, of, all, the, elementary, properties, that, constitute, it, for, what, it, is, which, deserve, to, be, respected, at, least, in, a, minimal, and, overridable, sense, and, hence, place, moral, claims, on, the, interacting, agent, and, ought, to, contribute, to, the, constraint, and, guidance, of, his, ethical, decisions, and, behaviour, floridi, goes, on, to, claim, that, this, ontological, equality, principle, means, that, any, form, of, reality, any, instance, of, information, being, simply, for, the, fact, of, being, what, it, is, enjoys, a, minimal, initial, overridable, equal, right, to, exist, and, develop, in, a, way, which, is, appropriate, to, its, nature, values, in, his, claims, correlate, to, those, shown, in, the, sociological, textbook, you, may, ask, yourself, by, dalton, conley, the, notion, of, ontological, equality, describes, equality, by, saying, everything, is, equal, by, nature, everyone, is, created, equal, at, birth, everything, has, an, equal, right, to, exist, and, develop, by, its, nature
