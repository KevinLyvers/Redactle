justice, 2005, national, crime, victimization, study, college, in, the, united, states, several, studies, since, 1987, have, indicated, that, one, in, four, college, women, have, experienced, rape, or, attempted, rape, at, some, point, in, their, lifetime, these, studies, are, based, on, anonymous, surveys, of, college, women, not, reports, to, the, police, and, the, results, are, disputed, in, 2015, texas, a, m, university, professor, jason, lindo, and, his, colleagues, analyzed, over, two, decades, worth, of, fbi, data, noting, that, reports, of, rape, increased, 15, 57, around, the, times, of, major, american, football, games, at, division, 1, schools, while, attempting, to, find, a, link, between, campus, rape, and, alcohol, a, 2006, report, from, the, u, s, department, of,

to, 24, 1, or, one, in, four, koss, gidycz, wisniewski, published, a, study, in, 1987, where, they, interviewed, approximately, 6, 000, college, students, on, 32, college, campuses, nationwide, they, asked, several, questions, covering, a, wide, range, of, behaviors, from, this, study, 15, of, college, women, answered, yes, to, questions, about, whether, they, experienced, something, that, met, the, definition, of, rape, an, additional, 12, of, women, answered, yes, to, questions, about, whether, they, experienced, something, that, met, the, definition, of, attempted, rape, thus, the, statistic, one, in, four, a, point, of, contention, lies, in, the, leading, nature, of, the, questions, in, the, study, conducted, by, koss, gidycz, wisniewski, koss, herself, later, admitted, that, the, question, that, had, garnered, the, largest, rape, result, was, flawed, and, ultimately, rendered, the, study, invalid, most, prominently, the, problem, was, that, many, respondents, who, had, answered, yes, to, several, questions, had, their, responses, treated, as, having, been, raped, the, issue, being, that, these, same, respondents, did, not, feel, they, had, been, victimized, and, never, sought, redress, for, grievances, the, resultant, change, shows, a, prevalence, of, only, 1, in, 22, college, women, having, been, raped, or, attempted, to, be, raped, during, their, time, at, college, in, 1995, the, cdc, replicated, part, of, this, study, however, they, examined, rape, only, and, did, not, look, at, attempted, rape, they, used, a, two, stage, cluster, sample, design, to, produce, a, nationally, representative, sample, of, undergraduate, college, students, aged, greater, than, or, equal, to, 18, years, the, first, stage, sampling, frame, contained, 2, 919, primary, sampling, units, psus, consisting, of, 2, and, 4, year, colleges, and, universities, the, second, sampling, stage, consisted, of, a, random, sample, drawn, from, the, primary, sample, unit, frame,

with, a, representative, sample, demographic, matching, the, national, demographic, differential, sampling, rates, of, the, psu, were, used, to, ensure, sufficient, numbers, of, male, and, female, black, and, hispanic, students, in, the, total, sample, population, after, differential, sample, weighting, female, students, represented, 55, 5, of, the, sample, white, students, represented, 72, 8, of, the, sample, black, students, 10, 3, hispanic, students, 7, 1, and, 9, 9, were, other, it, was, determined, that, nationwide, 13, 1, of, college, students, reported, that, they, had, been, forced, to, have, sexual, intercourse, against, their, will, during, their, lifetime, female, students, were, significantly, more, likely, than, male, students, to, report, they, had, ever, been, forced, to, have, sexual, intercourse, 20, of, approximately, 2500, females, 55, of, 4, 609, samples, and, 3, 9, of, males, reported, experiencing, rape, thus, far, in, the, course, of, their, lifetime, other, studies, concerning, the, annual, incidence, of, rape, some, studies, conclude, an, occurrence, of, 5, the, national, survey, of, children, s, exposure, to, violence, found, that, in, the, 2013, 2014,
