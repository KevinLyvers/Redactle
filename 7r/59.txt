https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermarket
a, supermarket, is, a, self, service, shop, offering, a, wide, variety, of, food, beverages, and, household, products, organized, into, sections, this, kind, of, store, is, larger, and, has, a, wider, selection, than, earlier, grocery, stores, but, is, smaller, and, more, limited, in, the, range, of, merchandise, than, a, hypermarket, or, big, box, market, in, everyday, united, states, usage, however, grocery, store, is, often, used, to, mean, supermarket, the, supermarket, typically, has, places, for, fresh, meat, fresh, produce, dairy, deli, items, baked, goods, and, similar, foodstuffs, shelf, space, is, also, reserved, for, canned, and, packaged, goods, and, for, various, non, food, items, such, as, kitchenware, household, cleaners, pharmacy, products, and, pet, supplies, some, supermarkets, also, sell, other, household, products, that, are, consumed, regularly, such, as, alcohol, where, permitted, medicine, and, clothing, and, some, sell, a, much, wider, range, of, non, food, products, dvds, sporting, equipment, board, games, and, seasonal, items, e, g, christmas, wrapping, paper, easter, eggs, school, uniforms, valentine, s, day, themed, gifts, mother, s, day, gifts, father, s, day, gifts, and, halloween, a, larger, full, service, supermarket, combined, with, a, department, store, is, sometimes, known, as, a, hypermarket, other, services, may, include, those, of, banks, caf, s, childcare, centers, creches, insurance, and, other, financial, services, mobile, phone, sales, photo, processing, video, rentals, pharmacies, and, gas, stations, if, the, eatery, in, a, supermarket, is, substantial, enough, the, facility, may, be, called, a, grocerant, a, portmanteau, of, grocery, and, restaurant, the, traditional, supermarket, occupies, a, large, amount, of, floor, space, usually, on, a, single, level, it, is, usually, situated, near, a, residential, area, in, order, to, be, convenient, to, consumers, the, basic, appeal, is, the, availability, of, a, broad, selection, of, goods, under, a, single, roof, at, relatively, low, prices, other, advantages, include, ease, of, parking, and, frequently, the, convenience, of, shopping, hours, that, extend, into, the, evening, or, even, 24, hours, of, the, day, supermarkets, usually, allocate, large, budgets, to, advertising, typically, through, newspapers, and, television, they, also, present, elaborate, in, shop, displays, of, products, supermarkets, typically, are, chain, stores, supplied, by, the, distribution, centers, of, their, parent, companies, thus, increasing, opportunities, for, economies, of, scale, supermarkets, usually, offer, products, at, relatively, low, prices, by, using, their, buying, power, to, buy, goods, from, manufacturers, at, lower, prices, than, smaller, stores, can, they, also, minimize, financing, costs, by, paying, for, goods, at, least, 30, days, after, receipt, and, some, extract, credit, terms, of, 90, days, or, more, from, vendors, certain, products, typically, staple, foods, such, as, bread, milk, and, sugar, are, very, occasionally, sold, as, loss, leaders, so, as, to, attract, shoppers, to, their, store, supermarkets, make, up, for, their, low, margins, by, a, high, volume, of, sales, and, with, of, higher, margin, items, bought, by, the, customers, self, service, with, shopping, carts, trolleys, or, baskets, reduces, labor, costs, and, many, supermarket, chains, are, attempting, further, reduction, by, shifting, to, self, service, check, outs, historically, the, earliest, retailers, were, peddlers, who, marketed, their, wares, in, the, streets, however, by, the, 1920s, retail, food, sales, in, the, united, states, had, mostly, shifted, to, small, corner, grocery, stores, in, that, era, the, standard, retail, grocery, business, model, was, for, a, clerk, to, fetch, products, from, shelves, behind, the, merchant, s, counter, while, customers, waited, in, front, of, the, counter, indicating, the, items, they, wanted, most, foods, and, merchandise, did, not, come, in, individually, wrapped, consumer, sized, packages, so, the, clerk, had, to, measure, out, and, wrap, the, precise, amount, desired, merchants, did, not, post, prices, which, forced, customers, to, haggle, and, bargain, with, clerks, to, reach, fair, prices, for, their, purchases, this, business, model, had, already, been, established, in, europe, for, several, centuries, it, offered, extensive, opportunities, for, social, interaction, many, regarded, this, style, of, shopping, as, a, social, occasion, and, would, often, pause, for, conversations, with, the, staff, or, other, customers, these, practices, were, by, nature, slow, had, high, labor, intensity, and, were, quite, expensive, the, number, of, customers, who, could, be, attended, to, at, one, time, was, limited, by, the, number, of, staff, employed, in, the, store, shopping, for, groceries, often, also, involved, trips, to, multiple, specialty, shops, such, as, a, greengrocer, butcher, bakery, fishmonger, and, dry, goods, store, in, addition, to, a, general, store, milk, and, other, items, of, short, shelf, life, were, delivered, by, a, milkman, the, concept, of, an, inexpensive, food, market, relying, on, economies, of, scale, was, developed, by, vincent, astor, he, founded, the, astor, market, in, 1915, investing, 750, 000, of, his, fortune, into, a, 165, by, 125, 50, 38, metre, corner, of, 95th, and, broadway, manhattan, creating, in, effect, an, open, air, mini, mall, that, sold, meat, fruit, produce, and, flowers, the, expectation, was, that, customers, would, come, from, great, distances, miles, around, but, in, the, end, even, attracting, people, from, ten, blocks, away, was, difficult, and, the, market, folded, in, 1917, the, great, atlantic, pacific, tea, company, a, p, which, was, established, in, 1859, was, an, early, grocery, store, chain, in, canada, and, the, united, states, it, became, common, in, north, american, cities, in, the, 1920s, early, chains, like, a, p, did, not, sell, fresh, meats, or, produce, during, the, 1920s, to, reduce, the, hassle, of, visiting, multiple, stores, u, s, grocery, store, chains, like, a, p, introduced, the, combination, store, this, was, a, grocery, store, which, combined, several, departments, under, one, roof, but, generally, maintained, the, traditional, system, of, clerks, pulling, products, from, shelves, on, request, by, 1929, only, one, in, three, u, s, grocery, stores, was, a, combination, store, the, concept, of, a, self, service, grocery, store, predates, the, supermarket, it, was, developed, by, entrepreneur, clarence, saunders, at, his, piggly, wiggly, stores, the, first, of, which, opened, in, 1916, saunders, was, awarded, several, patents, for, the, ideas, he, incorporated, into, his, stores, the, stores, were, a, financial, success, and, saunders, began, to, offer, franchises, the, general, trend, since, then, has, been, to, stock, shelves, at, night, so, that, customers, the, following, day, can, obtain, their, own, goods, and, bring, them, to, the, front, of, the, store, to, pay, for, them, although, there, is, a, higher, risk, of, shoplifting, the, costs, of, appropriate, security, measures, ideally, will, be, outweighed, by, reduced, labor, costs, historically, there, has, been, much, debate, about, the, origin, of, the, supermarket, for, example, southern, california, grocery, store, chains, alpha, beta, and, ralphs, both, have, strong, claims, to, being, the, first, supermarket, by, 1930, both, chains, were, already, operating, multiple, 12, 000, square, foot, 1, 100, m, 2, self, service, grocery, stores, however, as, of, 1930, both, chains, were, not, yet, true, supermarkets, in, the, modern, sense, because, their, prices, remained, quite, high, one, of, the, most, important, defining, features, of, the, supermarket, is, cheap, food, their, main, selling, point, was, free, parking, other, strong, contenders, in, texas, included, weingarten, s, and, henke, pillot, to, end, the, debate, the, food, marketing, institute, in, conjunction, with, the, smithsonian, institution, and, with, funding, from, h, j, heinz, researched, the, issue, they, defined, the, attributes, of, a, supermarket, as, self, service, separate, product, departments, discount, pricing, marketing, and, volume, selling, they, determined, that, the, first, true, supermarket, in, the, united, states, was, opened, by, a, former, kroger, employee, michael, j, cullen, on, 4, august, 1930, inside, a, 6, 000, square, foot, 560, m, 2, former, garage, in, jamaica, queens, in, new, york, city, the, store, king, kullen, operated, under, the, logic, of, pile, it, high, and, sell, it, cheap, the, layout, was, designed, by, joseph, unger, who, originated, the, concept, of, customers, using, baskets, to, collect, groceries, before, checking, out, at, a, counter, everything, displayed, for, sale, in, the, store, had, prices, clearly, marked, meaning, that, consumers, would, no, longer, need, to, haggle, over, prices, cullen, described, his, store, as, the, world, s, greatest, price, wrecker, at, the, time, of, his, death, in, 1936, there, were, seventeen, king, kullen, stores, in, operation, although, saunders, had, brought, the, world, self, service, uniform, stores, and, nationwide, marketing, cullen, built, on, this, idea, by, adding, separate, food, departments, selling, large, volumes, of, food, at, discount, prices, and, adding, a, parking, lot, early, supermarkets, like, king, kullen, were, called, cheapy, markets, by, industry, experts, at, the, time, this, was, soon, replaced, by, the, phrase, super, market, the, compound, phrase, was, then, closed, up, to, become, the, modern, term, supermarket, other, established, american, grocery, chains, in, the, 1930s, such, as, kroger, and, safeway, inc, at, first, resisted, cullen, s, idea, but, were, eventually, forced, to, build, their, own, supermarkets, as, the, economy, sank, into, the, great, depression, american, consumers, became, extraordinarily, price, sensitive, at, a, level, never, experienced, before, kroger, took, the, idea, one, step, further, and, pioneered, the, first, supermarket, surrounded, on, all, four, sides, by, a, parking, lot, once, the, large, chains, joined, the, supermarket, trend, the, new, retail, format, became, widespread, the, number, of, american, supermarkets, almost, tripled, from, 1, 200, in, 32, states, in, 1936, to, over, 3, 000, in, 47, states, in, 1937, it, was, well, over, 15, 000, by, 1950, one, sign, of, the, supermarket, format, s, success, in, slashing, labor, costs, overhead, and, food, prices, was, that, the, percentage, of, disposable, income, spent, by, american, consumers, on, food, plunged, from, 21, percent, in, 1930, to, 16, percent, in, 1940, the, modern, era, of, cheap, food, had, begun, as, large, chain, stores, began, to, dominate, the, american, grocery, landscape, with, their, low, overhead, and, low, prices, while, crushing, numerous, independent, small, stores, along, the, way, a, backlash, to, this, radical, alteration, of, food, distribution, infrastructure, appeared, in, the, form, of, numerous, anti, chain, campaigns, the, idea, of, monopsony, proposed, by, cambridge, economist, joan, robinson, in, 1933, that, a, single, buyer, could, outmaneuver, a, market, of, multiple, sellers, became, a, strong, anti, chain, rhetorical, device, with, public, backlash, came, political, pressure, to, even, the, playing, field, for, smaller, vendors, lacking, the, luxury, of, economies, of, scale, in, 1936, the, robinson, patman, act, was, implemented, as, a, way, of, preventing, such, large, chains, from, using, their, buying, power, to, reap, advantages, over, small, stores, although, the, act, was, not, well, enforced, and, did, not, have, much, impact, on, such, chains, supermarkets, rapidly, proliferated, across, both, canada, and, the, united, states, with, the, growth, of, automobile, ownership, and, suburban, development, after, world, war, ii, most, north, american, supermarkets, are, located, in, suburban, strip, shopping, centers, as, an, anchor, store, along, with, other, smaller, retailers, they, are, generally, regional, rather, than, national, in, their, company, branding, kroger, is, the, most, nationally, oriented, supermarket, chain, in, the, united, states, but, it, has, preserved, most, of, its, regional, brands, including, ralphs, city, market, king, soopers, fry, s, smith, s, and, qfc, in, canada, the, largest, such, company, is, loblaw, which, operates, stores, under, a, variety, of, banners, targeted, to, different, segments, and, regions, including, fortinos, zehrs, no, frills, the, real, canadian, superstore, and, loblaws, the, foundation, of, the, company, sobeys, is, canada, s, second, largest, supermarket, with, locations, across, the, country, operating, under, many, banners, sobeys, iga, in, quebec, qu, bec, s, first, supermarket, opened, in, 1934, in, montr, al, under, the, banner, steinberg, s, in, the, united, kingdom, self, service, shopping, took, longer, to, become, established, even, in, 1947, there, were, just, ten, self, service, shops, in, the, country, in, 1951, ex, us, navy, sailor, patrick, galvani, son, in, law, of, express, dairies, chairman, made, a, pitch, to, the, board, to, open, a, chain, of, supermarkets, across, the, country, the, uk, s, first, supermarket, under, the, new, premier, supermarkets, brand, opened, in, streatham, south, london, taking, ten, times, as, much, per, week, as, the, average, british, general, store, of, the, time, other, chains, caught, on, and, after, galvani, lost, out, to, tesco, s, jack, cohen, in, 1960, to, buy, the, 212, irwin, s, chain, the, sector, underwent, a, large, amount, of, consolidation, resulting, in, the, big, four, dominant, uk, of, today, tesco, asda, sainsbury, s, and, morrisons, in, the, 1950s, supermarkets, frequently, issued, trading, stamps, as, incentives, to, customers, today, most, chains, issue, store, specific, membership, cards, club, cards, or, loyalty, cards, these, typically, enable, the, cardholder, to, receive, special, members, only, discounts, on, certain, items, when, the, credit, card, like, device, is, scanned, at, the, checkout, sales, of, selected, data, generated, by, club, cards, is, becoming, a, significant, revenue, stream, for, some, supermarkets, traditional, supermarkets, in, many, countries, face, intense, competition, from, discounters, such, as, wal, mart, aldi, and, lidl, which, typically, is, non, union, and, operates, with, better, buying, power, other, competition, exists, from, warehouse, clubs, such, as, costco, that, offer, savings, to, customers, buying, in, bulk, quantities, superstores, such, as, those, operated, by, wal, mart, and, asda, often, offer, a, wide, range, of, goods, and, services, in, addition, to, foods, in, australia, aldi, woolworths, and, coles, are, the, major, players, running, the, industry, with, fierce, competition, among, all, the, three, the, rising, market, share, of, aldi, has, forced, the, other, two, to, cut, prices, and, increase, their, private, label, product, ranges, the, proliferation, of, such, warehouse, and, superstores, has, contributed, to, the, continuing, disappearance, of, smaller, local, grocery, stores, the, increased, dependence, on, the, automobile, and, suburban, sprawl, because, of, the, necessity, for, large, floor, space, and, increased, vehicular, traffic, for, example, in, 2009, 51, of, wal, mart, s, 251, billion, domestic, sales, were, recorded, from, grocery, goods, some, critics, consider, the, chains, common, practice, of, selling, loss, leaders, to, be, anti, competitive, they, are, also, wary, of, the, negotiating, power, that, large, often, multinationals, have, with, suppliers, around, the, world, during, the, dot, com, boom, webvan, an, online, only, supermarket, was, formed, and, went, bankrupt, after, three, years, and, was, acquired, by, amazon, the, british, online, supermarket, ocado, which, uses, a, high, degree, of, automation, in, its, warehouses, was, the, first, successful, online, only, supermarket, ocado, expanded, into, providing, services, to, other, supermarket, firms, such, as, waitrose, and, morrisons, grocery, stores, such, as, walmart, employ, food, delivery, services, offered, by, third, parties, such, as, doordash, other, online, food, delivery, services, such, as, deliveroo, in, the, united, kingdom, have, begun, to, pay, specific, attention, to, supermarket, delivery, delivery, robots, are, offered, by, various, companies, partnering, with, supermarkets, micro, fulfillment, centers, mfc, are, relatively, small, warehouses, with, sophisticated, automated, rack, and, tote, systems, which, prepare, orders, for, pickup, and, delivery, once, the, order, is, complete, the, customer, will, pick, it, up, i, e, click, and, collect, or, have, it, fulfilled, via, home, delivery, supermarkets, are, investing, in, micro, fulfillment, centers, with, the, hope, that, automation, can, help, reduce, the, costs, of, online, commerce, and, e, commerce, by, shortening, the, distances, from, store, to, home, and, speeding, up, deliveries, mfcs, are, said, by, many, to, be, the, key, to, profitably, fulfilling, online, orders, the, u, s, fmi, food, industry, association, drawing, on, research, by, willard, bishop, defines, the, following, formats, store, types, that, sell, groceries, commissaries, some, supermarkets, are, focusing, on, selling, more, or, even, exclusively, organically, certified, produce, others, are, trying, to, differentiate, themselves, by, selling, fewer, or, no, products, containing, palm, oil, this, as, the, demand, of, palm, oil, is, a, main, driver, for, the, destruction, of, rainforests, as, a, response, to, the, growing, concern, on, the, heavy, use, of, petroleum, based, plastics, for, food, packaging, so, called, zero, waste, and, plastic, free, supermarkets, and, groceries, are, on, the, rise, beginning, in, the, 1990s, the, food, sector, in, developing, countries, has, rapidly, transformed, particularly, in, latin, america, south, east, asia, india, china, and, south, africa, with, growth, has, come, considerable, competition, and, some, amount, of, consolidation, the, growth, has, been, driven, by, increasing, affluence, and, the, rise, of, a, middle, class, the, entry, of, women, into, the, workforce, with, a, consequent, incentive, to, seek, out, easy, to, prepare, foods, the, growth, in, the, use, of, refrigerators, making, it, possible, to, shop, weekly, instead, of, daily, and, the, growth, in, car, ownership, facilitating, journeys, to, distant, stores, and, purchases, of, large, quantities, of, goods, the, opportunities, presented, by, this, potential, have, encouraged, several, european, companies, to, invest, in, these, markets, mainly, in, asia, and, american, companies, to, invest, in, latin, america, and, china, local, companies, also, entered, the, market, initial, development, of, supermarkets, has, now, been, followed, by, hypermarket, growth, in, addition, there, were, investments, by, companies, such, as, makro, and, metro, cash, and, carry, in, large, scale, cash, and, carry, operations, while, the, growth, in, sales, of, processed, foods, in, these, countries, has, been, much, more, rapid, than, the, growth, in, fresh, food, sales, the, imperative, nature, of, supermarkets, to, achieve, economies, of, scale, in, purchasing, means, that, the, expansion, of, supermarkets, in, these, countries, has, important, repercussions, for, small, farmers, particularly, those, growing, perishable, crops, new, supply, chains, have, developed, involving, cluster, formation, development, of, specialized, wholesalers, leading, farmers, organizing, supply, and, farmer, associations, or, cooperatives, in, some, cases, supermarkets, have, organized, their, own, procurement, from, small, farmers, in, others, wholesale, markets, have, adapted, to, meet, supermarket, needs, larger, supermarkets, in, north, america, and, in, europe, typically, sell, many, items, among, many, brands, sizes, and, varieties, u, s, publisher, supermarket, news, lists, the, following, categories, for, example, hypermarkets, have, a, larger, range, of, non, food, categories, such, as, clothing, electronics, household, decoration, and, appliances, most, merchandise, is, already, packaged, when, it, arrives, at, the, supermarket, packages, are, placed, on, shelves, arranged, in, aisles, and, sections, according, to, type, of, item, some, items, such, as, fresh, produce, are, stored, in, bins, those, requiring, an, intact, cold, chain, are, in, temperature, controlled, display, cases, while, branding, and, store, advertising, will, differ, from, company, to, company, the, layout, of, a, supermarket, remains, virtually, unchanged, although, big, companies, spend, time, giving, consumers, a, pleasant, shopping, experience, the, design, of, a, supermarket, is, directly, connected, to, the, in, store, marketing, that, supermarkets, must, conduct, to, get, shoppers, to, spend, more, money, while, there, every, aspect, of, the, store, is, mapped, out, and, attention, is, paid, to, color, wording, and, surface, texture, the, overall, layout, of, a, supermarket, is, a, visual, merchandising, project, that, plays, a, major, role, stores, can, creatively, use, a, layout, to, alter, customers, perceptions, of, the, atmosphere, alternatively, they, can, enhance, the, store, s, atmospherics, through, visual, communications, signs, and, graphics, lighting, colors, and, scents, for, example, to, give, a, sense, of, the, supermarket, being, healthy, fresh, produce, is, deliberately, located, at, the, front, of, the, store, in, terms, of, bakery, items, supermarkets, usually, dedicate, 30, to, 40, feet, of, store, space, to, the, bread, aisle, supermarkets, are, designed, to, give, each, product, section, a, sense, of, individual, difference, and, this, is, evident, in, the, design, of, what, is, called, the, anchor, departments, fresh, produce, dairy, delicatessen, meat, and, the, bakery, each, section, has, different, floor, coverings, style, lighting, and, sometimes, even, individual, services, counters, to, allow, shoppers, to, feel, as, if, there, are, a, number, of, markets, within, this, one, supermarket, marketers, use, well, researched, techniques, to, try, to, control, purchasing, behavior, the, layout, of, a, supermarket, is, considered, by, some, to, consist, of, a, few, rules, of, thumb, and, three, layout, principles, the, high, draw, products, are, placed, in, separate, areas, of, the, store, to, keep, drawing, the, consumer, through, the, store, high, impulse, and, high, margin, products, are, placed, in, the, most, predominant, areas, to, grab, attention, power, products, are, placed, on, both, sides, of, the, aisle, to, create, increased, product, awareness, and, end, caps, are, used, to, receive, a, high, exposure, of, a, certain, product, whether, on, special, promotion, or, in, a, campaign, or, a, new, line, the, first, principle, of, the, layout, is, circulation, circulation, is, created, by, arranging, product, so, the, supermarket, can, control, the, traffic, flow, of, the, consumer, along, with, this, path, there, will, be, high, draw, high, impulse, items, that, will, influence, the, consumer, to, make, purchases, which, they, did, not, originally, intend, service, areas, such, as, restrooms, are, placed, in, a, location, which, draws, the, consumer, past, certain, products, to, create, extra, buys, necessity, items, such, as, bread, and, milk, are, found, at, the, rear, of, the, store, to, increase, the, start, of, circulation, cashiers, desks, are, placed, in, a, position, to, promote, circulation, in, most, supermarkets, the, entrance, will, be, on, the, right, hand, side, because, some, research, suggests, that, consumers, who, travel, in, a, counter, clockwise, direction, spend, more, however, other, researchers, have, argued, that, consumers, moving, in, a, clockwise, direction, can, form, better, mental, maps, of, the, store, leading, to, higher, sales, in, turn, the, second, principle, of, the, layout, is, coordination, coordination, is, the, organized, arrangement, of, product, that, promotes, sales, products, such, as, fast, selling, and, slow, selling, lines, are, placed, in, strategic, positions, in, aid, of, the, overall, sales, plan, managers, sometimes, place, different, items, in, fast, selling, places, to, increase, turnover, or, to, promote, a, new, line, the, third, principle, is, consumer, convenience, the, layout, of, a, supermarket, is, designed, to, create, a, high, degree, of, convenience, to, the, consumer, to, make, the, shopping, experience, pleasant, and, increase, customer, spending, this, is, done, through, the, character, of, merchandising, and, product, placement, there, are, many, different, ideas, and, theories, in, relation, to, layout, and, how, product, layout, can, influence, the, purchases, made, one, theory, suggests, that, certain, products, are, placed, together, or, near, one, another, that, are, of, a, similar, or, complementary, nature, to, increase, the, average, customer, spend, this, strategy, is, used, to, create, cross, category, sales, similarity, in, other, words, the, toothpaste, is, next, to, or, adjacent, the, toothbrushes, and, the, tea, and, coffee, are, down, the, same, aisle, as, the, sweet, biscuits, these, products, complement, one, another, and, placing, them, near, is, one, way, marketers, try, to, increase, purchases, for, vertical, placement, cheap, generic, brands, tend, to, be, on, the, lowest, shelves, products, appealing, to, children, are, placed, at, the, mid, thigh, level, and, the, most, profitable, brands, are, placed, at, eye, level, the, fourth, principle, is, the, use, of, color, psychology, and, the, locations, of, the, food, similar, to, its, use, in, fast, food, branding, consumer, psychologists, suggest, that, most, buyers, tend, to, enter, the, store, and, shop, to, their, right, first, some, supermarkets, therefore, choose, to, place, the, entrance, to, the, left, hand, side, as, the, consumer, will, likely, turn, right, upon, entry, and, this, allows, the, consumer, to, do, a, full, counter, clockwise, circle, around, the, store, before, returning, to, the, checkouts, this, suggests, that, supermarket, marketers, should, use, this, theory, to, their, advantage, by, placing,
