a, university, from, latin, universitas, a, whole, is, an, institution, of, higher, or, tertiary, education, and, research, which, awards, academic, degrees, in, several, academic, disciplines, university, is, derived, from, the, latin, phrase, universitas, magistrorum, et, scholarium, which, roughly, means, community, of, teachers, and, scholars, universities, typically, offer, both, undergraduate, and, postgraduate, programs, the, first, universities, in, europe, were, established, by, catholic, monks, the, university, of, bologna, universit, di, bologna, italy, which, was, founded, in, 1088, is, the, first, university, in, the, sense, of, the, original, latin, word, universitas, refers, in, general, to, a, number, of, persons, associated, into, one, body, a, society, company, community, guild, corporation, etc, as, urban, town, life, and, medieval, guilds, developed, specialized, associations, of, students, and, teachers, with, collective, legal, rights, these, rights, were, usually, guaranteed, by, charters, issued, by, princes, prelates, or, their, towns, became, denominated, by, this, general, term, like, other, guilds, they, were, self, regulating, and, determined, the, qualifications, of, their, members, in, modern, usage, the, word, has, come, to, mean, an, institution, of, higher, education, offering, tuition, in, mainly, non, vocational, subjects, and, typically, having, the, power, to, confer, degrees, the, earlier, emphasis, on, its, corporate, organization, is, no, longer, the, primary, feature, by, which, a, modern, university, is, recognised, the, original, latin, word, referred, to, degree, awarding, institutions, of, learning, in, western, and, central, europe, where, this, form, of, legal, organisation, was, prevalent, and, from, where, the, institution, spread, around, the, world, an, important, idea, in, the, definition, of, a, university, is, the, notion, of, academic, freedom, the, first, documentary, evidence, of, this, comes, from, early, in, the, life, of, the, university, of, bologna, which, adopted, an, academic, charter, the, constitutio, habita, in, 1155, or, 1158, which, guaranteed, the, right, of, a, traveling, scholar, to, unhindered, passage, in, the, interests, of, education, today, this, is, claimed, as, the, origin, of, academic, freedom, this, is, now, a, widely, accepted, concept, in, international, research, on, 18, september, 1988, 430, university, rectors, signed, the, magna, charta, universitatum, marking, the, 900th, anniversary, of, bologna, s, foundation, the, number, of, universities, signing, the, magna, charta, universitatum, continues, to, grow, drawing, from, all, parts, of, the, world, an, early, institution, often, called, a, university, is, the, harran, university, founded, in, the, late, 8th, century, scholars, occasionally, call, the, university, of, al, qarawiyyin, name, given, in, 1963, founded, as, a, mosque, by, fatima, al, fihri, in, 859, ce, a, university, although, jacques, verger, writes, that, this, is, done, out, of, scholarly, convenience, several, scholars, consider, that, al, qarawiyyin, was, founded, and, run, as, a, madrasa, until, after, world, war, ii, they, date, the, transformation, of, the, madrasa, of, al, qarawiyyin, into, a, university, to, its, modern, reorganization, in, 1963, in, the, wake, of, these, reforms, al, qarawiyyin, was, officially, renamed, university, of, al, quaraouiyine, two, years, later, some, scholars, including, george, makdisi, have, argued, that, early, medieval, universities, were, influenced, by, the, madrasas, in, al, andalus, the, emirate, of, sicily, and, the, middle, east, during, the, crusades, norman, daniel, however, views, this, argument, as, overstated, in, 2013, roy, lowe, and, yoshihito, claimed, that, the, influences, of, scholarship, from, the, islamic, world, on, the, universities, of, western, europe, requires, a, reconsideration, of, the, development, of, higher, education, turning, away, from, a, concern, with, local, institutional, structures, to, a, broader, consideration, within, a, global, context, although, there, are, antecedents, the, modern, university, is, generally, regarded, as, a, formal, institution, that, has, its, origin, in, the, medieval, christian, tradition, european, higher, education, took, place, for, hundreds, of, years, in, cathedral, schools, or, monastic, schools, scholae, monasticae, in, which, monks, and, nuns, taught, classes, evidence, of, these, immediate, forerunners, of, the, later, university, at, many, places, dates, back, to, the, 6th, century, in, europe, young, men, proceeded, to, university, when, they, had, completed, their, study, of, the, trivium, the, preparatory, arts, of, grammar, rhetoric, and, dialectic, or, logic, and, the, quadrivium, arithmetic, geometry, music, and, astronomy, the, earliest, universities, were, developed, under, the, aegis, of, the, latin, church, by, papal, bull, as, studia, generalia, and, perhaps, from, cathedral, schools, it, is, possible, however, that, the, development, of, cathedral, schools, into, universities, was, quite, rare, with, the, university, of, paris, being, an, exception, later, they, were, also, founded, by, kings, but, with, prior, papal, approval, university, of, naples, federico, ii, charles, university, in, prague, jagiellonian, university, in, krak, w, or, municipal, administrations, university, of, cologne, university, of, erfurt, in, the, early, medieval, period, most, new, universities, were, founded, from, pre, existing, schools, usually, when, these, schools, were, deemed, to, have, become, primarily, sites, of, higher, education, many, historians, state, that, universities, and, cathedral, schools, were, a, continuation, of, the, interest, in, learning, promoted, by, monasteries, pope, gregory, vii, was, crucial, in, promoting, and, regulating, the, concept, of, modern, university, as, his, 1079, papal, decree, ordered, the, regulated, establishment, of, cathedral, schools, that, transformed, themselves, into, the, first, european, universities, the, first, universities, in, europe, with, a, form, of, corporate, guild, structure, were, the, university, of, bologna, c, 1180, 1190, the, university, of, paris, c, 1208, 1210, later, associated, with, the, sorbonne, and, the, university, of, oxford, c, 1200, 1214, the, university, of, bologna, began, as, a, law, school, teaching, the, ius, gentium, or, roman, law, of, peoples, which, was, in, demand, across, europe, for, those, defending, the, right, of, incipient, nations, against, empire, and, church, the, university, of, bologna, or, alma, mater, studiorum, is, widely, recognized, as, the, oldest, university, that, is, independent, of, any, direct, authority, such, as, kings, emperors, or, religious, organizations, bologna, s, claim, to, being, the, oldest, university, is, based, on, its, unique, characteristics, such, as, its, autonomy, and, its, ability, to, grant, degrees, the, conventional, date, for, the, start, of, teaching, at, bologna, of, 1088, or, 1087, according, to, some, records, when, irnerius, commenced, teaching, emperor, justinian, s, 6th, century, codification, of, roman, law, the, corpus, iuris, civilis, recently, discovered, at, pisa, lay, students, arrived, in, the, city, from, many, lands, entering, into, a, contract, to, gain, this, knowledge, eventually, organising, themselves, into, nationes, divided, between, that, of, the, cismontanes, and, that, of, the, ultramontanes, the, students, had, all, the, power, and, dominated, the, masters, all, over, europe, rulers, and, city, governments, began, to, create, universities, to, satisfy, a, european, thirst, for, knowledge, and, the, belief, that, society, would, benefit, from, the, scholarly, expertise, generated, from, these, institutions, princes, and, leaders, of, city, governments, perceived, the, potential, benefits, of, having, a, scholarly, expertise, develop, with, the, ability, to, address, difficult, problems, and, achieve, desired, ends, the, emergence, of, humanism, was, essential, to, this, understanding, of, the, possible, utility, of, universities, as, well, as, the, revival, of, interest, in, knowledge, gained, from, ancient, greek, texts, the, recovery, of, aristotle, s, works, more, than, 3000, pages, of, it, would, eventually, be, translated, fuelled, a, spirit, of, inquiry, into, natural, processes, that, had, already, begun, to, emerge, in, the, 12th, century, some, scholars, believe, that, these, works, represented, one, of, the, most, important, document, discoveries, in, western, intellectual, history, richard, dales, for, instance, calls, the, discovery, of, aristotle, s, works, a, turning, point, in, the, history, of, western, thought, after, aristotle, re, emerged, a, community, of, scholars, primarily, communicating, in, latin, accelerated, the, process, and, practice, of, attempting, to, reconcile, the, thoughts, of, greek, antiquity, and, especially, ideas, related, to, understanding, the, natural, world, with, those, of, the, church, the, efforts, of, this, scholasticism, were, focused, on, applying, aristotelian, logic, and, thoughts, about, natural, processes, to, biblical, passages, and, attempting, to, prove, the, viability, of, those, passages, through, reason, this, became, the, primary, mission, of, lecturers, and, the, expectation, of, students, the, university, culture, developed, differently, in, northern, europe, than, it, did, in, the, south, although, the, northern, primarily, germany, france, and, great, britain, and, southern, universities, primarily, italy, did, have, many, elements, in, common, latin, was, the, language, of, the, university, used, for, all, texts, lectures, disputations, and, examinations, professors, lectured, on, the, books, of, aristotle, for, logic, natural, philosophy, and, metaphysics, while, hippocrates, galen, and, avicenna, were, used, for, medicine, outside, of, these, commonalities, great, differences, separated, north, and, south, primarily, in, subject, matter, italian, universities, focused, on, law, and, medicine, while, the, northern, universities, focused, on, the, arts, and, theology, the, quality, of, instruction, in, the, different, areas, of, study, varied, depending, on, the, university, s, focus, this, led, scholars, to, travel, north, or, south, based, on, their, interests, and, means, the, universities, also, awarded, different, types, of, degrees, english, french, and, german, universities, usually, awarded, bachelor, s, degrees, with, the, exception, of, degrees, in, theology, for, which, the, doctorate, was, more, common, italian, universities, awarded, primarily, doctorates, the, distinction, can, be, attributed, to, the, intent, of, the, degree, holder, after, graduation, in, the, north, the, focus, tended, to, be, on, acquiring, teaching, positions, while, in, the, south, students, often, went, on, to, professional, positions, the, structure, of, northern, universities, tended, to, be, modeled, after, the, system, of, faculty, governance, developed, at, the, university, of, paris, southern, universities, tended, to, be, patterned, after, the, student, controlled, model, begun, at, the, university, of, bologna, among, the, southern, universities, a, further, distinction, has, been, noted, between, those, of, northern, italy, which, followed, the, pattern, of, bologna, as, a, self, regulating, independent, corporation, of, scholars, and, those, of, southern, italy, and, iberia, which, were, founded, by, royal, and, imperial, charter, to, serve, the, needs, of, government, during, the, early, modern, period, approximately, late, 15th, century, to, 1800, the, universities, of, europe, would, see, a, tremendous, amount, of, growth, productivity, and, innovative, research, at, the, end, of, the, middle, ages, about, 400, years, after, the, first, european, university, was, founded, there, were, 29, universities, spread, throughout, europe, in, the, 15th, century, 28, new, ones, were, created, with, another, 18, added, between, 1500, and, 1625, this, pace, continued, until, by, the, end, of, the, 18th, century, there, were, approximately, 143, universities, in, europe, with, the, highest, concentrations, in, the, german, empire, 34, italian, countries, 26, france, 25, and, spain, 23, this, was, close, to, a, 500, increase, over, the, number, of, universities, toward, the, end, of, the, middle, ages, this, number, does, not, include, the, numerous, universities, that, disappeared, or, institutions, that, merged, with, other, universities, during, this, time, the, identification, of, a, university, was, not, necessarily, obvious, during, the, early, modern, period, as, the, term, is, applied, to, a, burgeoning, number, of, institutions, in, fact, the, term, university, was, not, always, used, to, designate, a, higher, education, institution, in, mediterranean, countries, the, term, studium, generale, was, still, often, used, while, academy, was, common, in, northern, european, countries, the, propagation, of, universities, was, not, necessarily, a, steady, progression, as, the, 17th, century, was, rife, with, events, that, adversely, affected, university, expansion, many, wars, and, especially, the, thirty, years, war, disrupted, the, university, landscape, throughout, europe, at, different, times, war, plague, famine, regicide, and, changes, in, religious, power, and, structure, often, adversely, affected, the, societies, that, provided, support, for, universities, internal, strife, within, the, universities, themselves, such, as, student, brawling, and, absentee, professors, acted, to, destabilize, these, institutions, as, well, universities, were, also, reluctant, to, give, up, older, curricula, and, the, continued, reliance, on, the, works, of, aristotle, defied, contemporary, advancements, in, science, and, the, arts, this, era, was, also, affected, by, the, rise, of, the, nation, state, as, universities, increasingly, came, under, state, control, or, formed, under, the, auspices, of, the, state, the, faculty, governance, model, begun, by, the, university, of, paris, became, more, and, more, prominent, although, the, older, student, controlled, universities, still, existed, they, slowly, started, to, move, toward, this, structural, organization, control, of, universities, still, tended, to, be, independent, although, university, leadership, was, increasingly, appointed, by, the, state, although, the, structural, model, provided, by, the, university, of, paris, where, student, members, are, controlled, by, faculty, masters, provided, a, standard, for, universities, the, application, of, this, model, took, at, least, three, different, forms, there, were, universities, that, had, a, system, of, faculties, whose, teaching, addressed, a, very, specific, curriculum, this, model, tended, to, train, specialists, there, was, a, collegiate, or, tutorial, model, based, on, the, system, at, university, of, oxford, where, teaching, and, organization, was, decentralized, and, knowledge, was, more, of, a, generalist, nature, there, were, also, universities, that, combined, these, models, using, the, collegiate, model, but, having, a, centralized, organization, early, modern, universities, initially, continued, the, curriculum, and, research, of, the, middle, ages, natural, philosophy, logic, medicine, theology, mathematics, astronomy, astrology, law, grammar, and, rhetoric, aristotle, was, prevalent, throughout, the, curriculum, while, medicine, also, depended, on, galen, and, arabic, scholarship, the, importance, of, humanism, for, changing, this, state, of, affairs, cannot, be, underestimated, once, humanist, professors, joined, the, university, faculty, they, began, to, transform, the, study, of, grammar, and, rhetoric, through, the, studia, humanitatis, humanist, professors, focused, on, the, ability, of, students, to, write, and, speak, with, distinction, to, translate, and, interpret, classical, texts, and, to, live, honorable, lives, other, scholars, within, the, university, were, affected, by, the, humanist, approaches, to, learning, and, their, linguistic, expertise, in, relation, to, ancient, texts, as, well, as, the, ideology, that, advocated, the, ultimate, importance, of, those, texts, professors, of, medicine, such, as, niccol, leoniceno, thomas, linacre, and, william, cop, were, often, trained, in, and, taught, from, a, humanist, perspective, as, well, as, translated, important, ancient, medical, texts, the, critical, mindset, imparted, by, humanism, was, imperative, for, changes, in, universities, and, scholarship, for, instance, andreas, vesalius, was, educated, in, a, humanist, fashion, before, producing, a, translation, of, galen, whose, ideas, he, verified, through, his, own, dissections, in, law, andreas, alciatus, infused, the, corpus, juris, with, a, humanist, perspective, while, jacques, cujas, humanist, writings, were, paramount, to, his, reputation, as, a, jurist, philipp, melanchthon, cited, the, works, of, erasmus, as, a, highly, influential, guide, for, connecting, theology, back, to, original, texts, which, was, important, for, the, reform, at, protestant, universities, galileo, galilei, who, taught, at, the, universities, of, pisa, and, padua, and, martin, luther, who, taught, at, the, university, of, wittenberg, as, did, melanchthon, also, had, humanist, training, the, task, of, the, humanists, was, to, slowly, permeate, the, university, to, increase, the, humanist, presence, in, professorships, and, chairs, syllabi, and, textbooks, so, that, published, works, would, demonstrate, the, humanistic, ideal, of, science, and, scholarship, although, the, initial, focus, of, the, humanist, scholars, in, the, university, was, the, discovery, exposition, and, insertion, of, ancient, texts, and, languages, into, the, university, and, the, ideas, of, those, texts, into, society, generally, their, influence, was, ultimately, quite, progressive, the, emergence, of, classical, texts, brought, new, ideas, and, led, to, a, more, creative, university, climate, as, the, notable, list, of, scholars, above, attests, to, a, focus, on, knowledge, coming, from, self, from, the, human, has, a, direct, implication, for, new, forms, of, scholarship, and, instruction, and, was, the, foundation, for, what, is, commonly, known, as, the, humanities, this, disposition, toward, knowledge, manifested, in, not, simply, the, translation, and, propagation, of, ancient, texts, but, also, their, adaptation, and, expansion, for, instance, vesalius, was, imperative, for, advocating, the, use, of, galen, but, he, also, invigorated, this, text, with, experimentation, disagreements, and, further, research, the, propagation, of, these, texts, especially, within, the, universities, was, greatly, aided, by, the, emergence, of, the, printing, press, and, the, beginning, of, the, use, of, the, vernacular, which, allowed, for, the, printing, of, relatively, large, texts, at, reasonable, prices, examining, the, influence, of, humanism, on, scholars, in, medicine, mathematics, astronomy, and, physics, may, suggest, that, humanism, and, universities, were, a, strong, impetus, for, the, scientific, revolution, although, the, connection, between, humanism, and, the, scientific, discovery, may, very, well, have, begun, within, the, confines, of, the, university, the, connection, has, been, commonly, perceived, as, having, been, severed, by, the, changing, nature, of, science, during, the, scientific, revolution, historians, such, as, richard, s, westfall, have, argued, that, the, overt, traditionalism, of, universities, inhibited, attempts, to, re, conceptualize, nature, and, knowledge, and, caused, an, indelible, tension, between, universities, and, scientists, this, resistance, to, changes, in, science, may, have, been, a, significant, factor, in, driving, many, scientists, away, from, the, university, and, toward, private, benefactors, usually, in, princely, courts, and, associations, with, newly, forming, scientific, societies, other, historians, find, incongruity, in, the, proposition, that, the, very, place, where, the, vast, number, of, the, scholars, that, influenced, the, scientific, revolution, received, their, education, should, also, be, the, place, that, inhibits, their, research, and, the, advancement, of, science, in, fact, more, than, 80, of, the, european, scientists, between, 1450, and, 1650, included, in, the, dictionary, of, scientific, biography, were, university, trained, of, which, approximately, 45, held, university, posts, it, was, the, case, that, the, academic, foundations, remaining, from, the, middle, ages, were, stable, and, they, did, provide, for, an, environment, that, fostered, considerable, growth, and, development, there, was, considerable, reluctance, on, the, part, of, universities, to, relinquish, the, symmetry, and, comprehensiveness, provided, by, the, aristotelian, system, which, was, effective, as, a, coherent, system, for, understanding, and, interpreting, the, world, however, university, professors, still, have, some, autonomy, at, least, in, the, sciences, to, choose, epistemological, foundations, and, methods, for, instance, melanchthon, and, his, disciples, at, university, of, wittenberg, were, instrumental, for, integrating, copernican, mathematical, constructs, into, astronomical, debate, and, instruction, another, example, was, the, short, lived, but, fairly, rapid, adoption, of, cartesian, epistemology, and, methodology, in, european, universities, and, the, debates, surrounding, that, adoption, which, led, to, more, mechanistic, approaches, to, scientific, problems, as, well, as, demonstrated, an, openness, to, change, there, are, many, examples, which, belie, the, commonly, perceived, intransigence, of, universities, although, universities, may, have, been, slow, to, accept, new, sciences, and, methodologies, as, they, emerged, when, they, did, accept, new, ideas, it, helped, to, convey, legitimacy, and, respectability, and, supported, the, scientific, changes, through, providing, a, stable, environment, for, instruction, and, material, resources, regardless, of, the, way, the, tension, between, universities, individual, scientists, and, the, scientific, revolution, itself, is, perceived, there, was, a, discernible, impact, on, the, way, that, university, education, was, constructed, aristotelian, epistemology, provided, a, coherent, framework, not, simply, for, knowledge, and, knowledge, construction, but, also, for, the, training, of, scholars, within, the, higher, education, setting, the, creation, of, new, scientific, constructs, during, the, scientific, revolution, and, the, epistemological, challenges, that, were, inherent, within, this, creation, initiated, the, idea, of, both, the, autonomy, of, science, and, the, hierarchy, of, the, disciplines, instead, of, entering, higher, education, to, become, a, general, scholar, immersed, in, becoming, proficient, in, the, entire, curriculum, there, emerged, a, type, of, scholar, that, put, science, first, and, viewed, it, as, a, vocation, in, itself, the, divergence, between, those, focused, on, science, and, those, still, entrenched, in, the, idea, of, a, general, scholar, exacerbated, the, epistemological, tensions, that, were, already, beginning, to, emerge, the, epistemological, tensions, between, scientists, and, universities, were, also, heightened, by, the, economic, realities, of, research, during, this, time, as, individual, scientists, associations, and, universities, were, vying, for, limited, resources, there, was, also, competition, from, the, formation, of, new, colleges, funded, by, private, benefactors, and, designed, to, provide, free, education, to, the, public, or, established, by, local, governments, to, provide, a, knowledge, hungry, populace, with, an, alternative, to, traditional, universities, even, when, universities, supported, new, scientific, endeavors, and, the, university, provided, foundational, training, and, authority, for, the, research, and, conclusions, they, could, not, compete, with, the, resources, available, through, private, benefactors, by, the, end, of, the, early, modern, period, the, structure, and, orientation, of, higher, education, had, changed, in, ways, that, are, eminently, recognizable, for, the, modern, context, aristotle, was, no, longer, a, force, providing, the, epistemological, and, methodological, focus, for, universities, and, a, more, mechanistic, orientation, was, emerging, the, hierarchical, place, of, theological, knowledge, had, for, the, most, part, been, displaced, and, the, humanities, had, become, a, fixture, and, a, new, openness, was, beginning, to, take, hold, in, the, construction, and, dissemination, of, knowledge, that, were, to, become, imperative, for, the, formation, of, the, modern, state, modern, universities, constitute, a, guild, or, quasi, guild, system, this, facet, of, the, university, system, did, not, change, due, to, its, peripheral, standing, in, an, industrialized, economy, as, commerce, developed, between, towns, in, europe, during, the, middle, ages, though, other, guilds, stood, in, the, way, of, developing, commerce, and, therefore, were, eventually, abolished, the, scholars, guild, did, not, according, to, historian, elliot, krause, the, university, and, scholars, guilds, held, onto, their, power, over, membership, training, and, workplace, because, early, capitalism, was, not, interested, in, it, by, the, 18th, century, universities, published, their, own, research, journals, and, by, the, 19th, century, the, german, and, the, french, university, models, had, arisen, the, german, or, humboldtian, model, was, conceived, by, wilhelm, von, humboldt, and, based, on, friedrich, schleiermacher, s, liberal, ideas, pertaining, to, the, importance, of, freedom, seminars, and, laboratories, in, universities, the, french, university, model, involved, strict, discipline, and, control, over, every, aspect, of, the, university, until, the, 19th, century, religion, played, a, significant, role, in, university, curriculum, however, the, role, of, religion, in, research, universities, decreased, during, that, century, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, the, german, university, model, had, spread, around, the, world, universities, concentrated, on, science, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, and, became, increasingly, accessible, to, the, masses, in, the, united, states, the, johns, hopkins, university, was, the, first, to, adopt, the, german, research, university, model, and, pioneered, the, adoption, of, that, model, by, most, american, universities, when, johns, hopkins, was, founded, in, 1876, nearly, the, entire, faculty, had, studied, in, germany, in, britain, the, move, from, industrial, revolution, to, modernity, saw, the, arrival, of, new, civic, universities, with, an, emphasis, on, science, and, engineering, a, movement, initiated, in, 1960, by, sir, keith, murray, chairman, of, the, university, grants, committee, and, sir, samuel, curran, with, the, formation, of, the, university, of, strathclyde, the, british, also, established, universities, worldwide, and, higher, education, became, available, to, the, masses, not, only, in, europe, in, 1963, the, robbins, report, on, universities, in, the, united, kingdom, concluded, that, such, institutions, should, have, four, main, objectives, essential, to, any, properly, balanced, system, instruction, in, skills, the, promotion, of, the, general, powers, of, the, mind, so, as, to, produce, not, mere, specialists, but, rather, cultivated, men, and, women, to, maintain, research, in, balance, with, teaching, since, teaching, should, not, be, separated, from, the, advancement, of, learning, and, the, search, for, truth, and, to, transmit, a, common, culture, and, common, standards, of, citizenship, in, the, early, 21st, century, concerns, were, raised, over, the, increasing, managerialisation, and, standardisation, of, universities, worldwide, neo, liberal, management, models, have, in, this, sense, been, critiqued, for, creating, corporate, universities, where, power, is, transferred, from, faculty, to, managers, economic, justifications, dominate, and, the, familiar, bottom, line, eclipses, pedagogical, or, intellectual, concerns, academics, understanding, of, time, pedagogical, pleasure, vocation, and, collegiality, have, been, cited, as, possible, ways, of, alleviating, such, problems, a, national, university, is, generally, a, university, created, or, run, by, a, national, state, but, at, the, same, time, represents, a, state, autonomic, institution, which, functions, as, a, completely, independent, body, inside, of, the, same, state, some, national, universities, are, closely, associated, with, national, cultural, religious, or, political, aspirations, for, instance, the, national, university, of, ireland, which, formed, partly, from, the, catholic, university, of, ireland, which, was, created, almost, immediately, and, specifically, in, answer, to, the, non, denominational, universities, which, had, been, set, up, in, ireland, in, 1850, in, the, years, leading, up, to, the, easter, rising, and, in, no, small, part, a, result, of, the, gaelic, romantic, revivalists, the, nui, collected, a, large, amount, of, information, on, the, irish, language, and, irish, culture, reforms, in, argentina, were, the, result, of, the, university, revolution, of, 1918, and, its, posterior, reforms, by, incorporating, values, that, sought, for, a, more, equal, and, laic, higher, education, system, universities, created, by, bilateral, or, multilateral, treaties, between, states, are, intergovernmental, an, example, is, the, academy, of, european, law, which, offers, training, in, european, law, to, lawyers, judges, barristers, solicitors, in, house,

least, one, vice, president, vice, chancellor, or, vice, rector, and, deans, of, various, divisions, universities, are, generally, divided, into, a, number, of, academic, departments, schools, or, faculties, public, university, systems, are, ruled, over, by, government, run, higher, education, boards, they, review, financial, requests, and, budget, proposals, and, then, allocate, funds, for, each, university, in, the, system, they, also, approve, new, programs, of, instruction, and, cancel, or, make, changes, in, existing, programs, in, addition, they, plan, for, the, further, coordinated, growth, and, development, of, the, various, institutions, of, higher, education, in, the, state, or, country, however, many, public, universities, in, the, world, have, a, considerable, degree, of, financial, research, and, pedagogical, autonomy, private, universities, are, privately, funded, and, generally, have, broader, independence, from, state, policies, however, they, may, have, less, independence, from, business, corporations, depending, on, the, source, of, their, finances, the, funding, and, organization, of, universities, varies, widely, between, different, countries, around, the, world, in, some, countries, universities, are, predominantly, funded, by, the, state, while, in, others, funding, may, come, from, donors, or, from, fees, which, students, attending, the, university, must, pay, in, some, countries, the, vast, majority, of, students, attend, university, in, their, local, town, while, in, other, countries, universities, attract, students, from, all, over, the, world, and, may, provide, university, accommodation, for, their, students, the, definition, of, a, university, varies, widely, even, within, some, countries, where, there, is, clarification, it, is, usually, set, by, a, government, agency, for, example, in, australia, the, tertiary, education, quality, and, standards, agency, teqsa, is, australia, s, independent, national, regulator, of, the, higher, education, sector, students, rights, within, university, are, also, protected, by, the, education, services, for, overseas, students, act, esos, in, the, united, states, there, is, no, nationally, standardized, definition, for, the, term, university, although, the, term, has, traditionally, been, used, to, designate, research, institutions, and, was, once, reserved, for, doctorate, granting, research, institutions, some, states, such, as, massachusetts, will, only, grant, a, school, university, status, if, it, grants, at, least, two, doctoral, degrees, in, the,

the, academic, status, and, the, privileges, of, a, university, through, this, provision, many, schools, that, are, commercial, in, nature, and, have, been, established, just, to, exploit, the,

example, mcgill, university, comprehensive, universities, that, have, some, phds, but, are, not, geared, toward, research, such, as, waterloo, and, smaller, primarily, undergraduate, universities, such, as, st, francis, xavier, in, germany, universities, are, institutions, of, higher, education, which, have, the, power, to, confer, bachelor, master, and, phd, degrees, they, are, explicitly,

apart, from, these, universities, germany, has, other, institutions, of, higher, education, hochschule, fachhochschule, fachhochschule, means, a, higher, education, institution, which, is, similar, to, the, former, polytechnics, in, the, british, education, system, the, english, term, used, for, these, german, institutions, is, usually, university, of, applied, sciences, they, can, confer, master, s, degrees, but, no, phds, they, are, similar, to, the, model, of, teaching, universities, with, less, research, and, the, research, undertaken, being, highly, practical, hochschule, can, refer, to, various, kinds, of, institutions, often, specialised, in, a, certain, field, e, g, music, fine, arts, business, they, might, or, might, not, have, the, power, to, award, phd, degrees,

german, speaking, countries, university, is, often, contracted, to, uni, in, ghana, new, zealand, bangladesh, and, in, south, africa, it, is, sometimes, called, varsity, although, this, has, become, uncommon, in, new, zealand, in, recent, years, varsity, was, also, common, usage, in, the, uk, in, the, 19th, century, in, many, countries, students, are, required, to, pay, tuition, fees, many, students, look, to, get, student, grants, to, cover, the, cost, of, university, in, 2016, the, average, outstanding, student, loan, balance, per, borrower, in, the, united, states, was, us, 30, 000, in, many, u, s, states, costs, are, anticipated, to, rise, for, students, as, a, result, of, decreased, state, funding, given, to, public, universities, many, universities, in, the, united, states, offer, students, the, opportunity, to, apply, for, financial, scholarships, to, help, pay, for, tuition, based, on, academic, achievement, there, are, several, major, exceptions, on, tuition, fees, in, many, european, countries, it, is, possible, to, study, without, tuition, fees, public, universities, in, nordic, countries, were, entirely, without, tuition, fees, until, around, 2005, denmark, sweden, and, finland, then, moved, to, put, in, place, tuition, fees, for, foreign, students, citizens, of, eu, and, eea, member, states, and, citizens, from, switzerland, remain, exempted, from, tuition, fees, and, the, amounts, of, public, grants, granted, to, promising, foreign, students, were, increased, to, offset, some, of, the, impact, the, situation, in, germany, is, similar, public, universities, usually, do, not, charge, tuition, fees, apart, from, a, small, administrative, fee, for, degrees, of, a, postgraduate, professional, level, sometimes, tuition, fees, are, levied, private, universities, however, almost, always, charge, tuition, fees, the, adjustments, of, original, institutions, of, the, higher, learning, the, madrasah, significantly, the, institutional, adjustments, of, the, madrasahs, affected, both, the, structure, and, the, content, of, these, institutions, in, terms, of, structure, the, adjustments, were, twofold, the, reorganization, of, the, available, original, madaris, and, the, creation, of, new, institutions, this, resulted, in, two, different, types, of, islamic, teaching, institutions, in, al, maghrib, the, first, type, was, derived, from, the, fusion, of, old, madaris, with, new, universities, for, example, morocco, transformed, al, qarawiyin, 859, a, d, into, a, university, under, the, supervision, of, the, ministry, of, education, in, 1963, the, quaraouiyine, mosque, founded, in, 859, is, the, most, famous, mosque, of, morocco, and, attracted, continuous, investment, by, muslim, rulers, as, for, the, nature, of, its, curriculum, it, was, typical, of, other, major, madrasahs, such, as, al, azhar, and, al, quaraouiyine, though, many, of, the, texts, used, at, the, institution, came, from, muslim, spain, al, quaraouiyine, began, its, life, as, a, small, mosque, constructed, in, 859, c, e, by, means, of, an, endowment, bequeathed, by, a, wealthy, woman, of, much, piety, fatima, bint, muhammed, al, fahri, higher, education, has, always, been, an, integral, part, of, morocco, going, back, to, the, ninth, century, when, the, karaouine, mosque, was, established, the, madrasa, known, today, as, al, qayrawaniyan, university, became, part, of, the, state, university, system, in, 1947, madrasa, in, modern, usage, the, name, of, an, institution, of, learning, where, the, islamic, sciences, are, taught, i, e, a, college, for, higher, studies, as, opposed, to, an, elementary, school, of, traditional, type, kuttab, in, medieval, usage, essentially, a, college, of, law, in, which, the, other, islamic, sciences, including, literary, and, philosophical, ones, were, ancillary, subjects, only, a, madrasa, is, a, college, of, islamic, law, the, madrasa, was, an, educational, institution, in, which, islamic, law, fiqh, was, taught, according, to, one, or, more, sunni, rites, maliki, shafi, i, hanafi, or, hanbali, it, was, supported, by, an, endowment, or, charitable, trust, waqf, that, provided, for, at, least, one, chair, for, one, professor, of, law, income, for, other, faculty, or, staff, scholarships, for, students, and, funds, for, the, maintenance, of, the, building, madrasas, contained, lodgings, for, the, professor, and, some, of, his, students, subjects, other, than, law, were, frequently, taught, in, madrasas, and, even, sufi, seances, were, held, in, them, but, there, could, be, no, madrasa, without, law, as, technically, the, major, subject, in, studying, an, institution, which, is, foreign, and, remote, in, point, of, time, as, is, the, case, of, the, medieval, madrasa, one, runs, the, double, risk, of, attributing, to, it, characteristics, borrowed, from, one, s, own, institutions, and, one, s, own, times, thus, gratuitous, transfers, may, be, made, from, one, culture, to, the, other, and, the, time, factor, may, be, ignored, or, dismissed, as, being, without, significance, one, cannot, therefore, be, too, careful, in, attempting, a, comparative, study, of, these, two, institutions, the, madrasa, and, the, university, but, in, spite, of, the, pitfalls, inherent, in, such, a, study, albeit, sketchy, the, results, which, may, be, obtained, are, well, worth, the, risks, involved, in, any, case, one, cannot, avoid, making, comparisons, when, certain, unwarranted, statements, have, already, been, made, and, seem, to, be, currently, accepted, without, question, the, most, unwarranted, of, these, statements, is, the, one, which, makes, of, the, madrasa, a, university, al, qarawiyin, is, the, oldest, university, in, morocco, it, was, founded, as, a, mosque, in, f, s, in, the, middle, of, the, ninth, century, it, has, been, a, destination, for, students, and, scholars, of, islamic, sciences, and, arabic, studies, throughout, the, history, of, morocco, there, were, also, other, religious, schools, like, the, madras, of, ibn, yusuf, and, other, schools, in, the, sus, this, system, of, basic, education, called, al, ta, lim, al, asil, was, funded, by, the, sultans, of, morocco, and, many, famous, traditional, families, after, independence, al, qarawiyin, maintained, its, reputation, but, it, seemed, important, to, transform, it, into, a, university, that, would, prepare, graduates, for, a, modern, country, while, maintaining, an, emphasis, on, islamic, studies, hence, al, qarawiyin, university, was, founded, in, february, 1963, and, while, the, dean, s, residence, was, kept, in, f, s, the, new, university, initially, had, four, colleges, located, in, major, regions, of, the, country, known, for, their, religious, influences, and, madrasas, these, colleges, were, kuliyat, al, shari, s, in, f, s, kuliyat, usul, al, din, in, t, touan, kuliyat, al, lugha, al, arabiya, in, marrakech, all, founded, in, 1963, and, kuliyat, al, shari, a, in, ait, melloul, near, agadir, which, was, founded, in, 1979
