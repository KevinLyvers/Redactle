the, rule, of, law, is, a, political, ideal, that, all, citizens, and, institutions, within, a, country, state, or, community, are, accountable, to, the, same, laws, including, lawmakers, and, leaders, it, is, sometimes, stated, simply, as, no, one, is, above, the, law, the, term, rule, of, law, is, closely, related, to, constitutionalism, as, well, as, rechtsstaat, it, refers, to, a, political, situation, not, to, any, specific, legal, rule, the, rule, of, law, is, defined, in, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, as, the, mechanism, process, institution, practice, or, norm, that, supports, the, equality, of, all, citizens, before, the, law, secures, a, nonarbitrary, form, of, government, and, more, generally, prevents, the, arbitrary, use, of, power, use, of, the, phrase, can, be, traced, to, 16th, century, britain, in, the, following, century, scottish, theologian, samuel, rutherford, employed, it, in, arguing, against, the, divine, right, of, kings, john, locke, wrote, that, freedom, in, society, means, being, subject, only, to, laws, written, by, a, legislature, that, apply, to, everyone, with, a, person, being, otherwise, free, from, both, governmental, and, private, restrictions, on, his, liberty, the, rule, of, law, was, further, popularized, in, the, 19th, century, by, british, jurist, a, v, dicey, however, the, principle, if, not, the, phrase, itself, was, recognized, by, ancient, thinkers, aristotle, wrote, it, is, more, proper, that, law, should, govern, than, any, one, of, the, citizens, upon, the, same, principle, if, it, is, advantageous, to, place, the, supreme, power, in, some, particular, persons, they, should, be, appointed, to, be, only, guardians, and, the, servants, of, the, laws, the, rule, of, law, implies, that, every, person, is, subject, to, the, law, including, persons, who, are, lawmakers, law, enforcement, officials, and, judges, distinct, is, the, rule, of, man, where, one, person, or, group, of, persons, rule, arbitrarily, the, earliest, conception, of, rule, of, law, can, be, traced, back, to, the, indian, epics, ramayana, and, mahabharata, the, earliest, versions, of, which, date, around, to, 8th, or, 9th, centuries, bc, although, they, were, written, down, as, texts, much, later, owing, to, the, shruti, smriti, tradition, the, mahabharata, deals, with, the, concepts, of, dharma, used, to, mean, law, and, duty, interchangeably, rajdharma, duty, of, the, king, and, dharmaraja, as, yudhishthir, the, eldest, of, the, five, pandava, brothers, was, known, and, states, in, one, of, its, slokas, that, a, king, who, after, having, sworn, that, he, shall, protect, his, subjects, fails, to, protect, them, should, be, executed, like, a, mad, dog, and, also, that, the, people, should, execute, a, king, who, does, not, protect, them, but, deprives, them, of, their, property, and, assets, and, who, takes, no, advice, or, guidance, from, any, one, such, a, king, is, not, a, king, but, misfortune, other, sources, for, the, philosophy, of, rule, of, law, can, be, traced, to, the, upanishads, which, state, that, the, law, is, the, king, of, the, kings, no, one, is, higher, than, the, law, not, even, the, king, other, commentaries, include, kautilya, s, arthashastra, 4th, century, bc, manusmriti, dated, to, the, 1st, to, 3rd, century, ce, yajnavalkya, smriti, dated, between, the, 3rd, and, 5th, century, ce, brihaspati, smriti, dated, between, 15, ce, and, 16, ce, several, scholars, have, also, traced, the, concept, of, the, rule, of, law, back, to, 4th, century, bc, athens, seeing, it, either, as, the, dominant, value, of, the, athenian, democracy, or, as, one, held, in, conjunction, with, the, concept, of, popular, sovereignty, however, these, arguments, have, been, challenged, and, the, present, consensus, is, that, upholding, an, abstract, concept, of, the, rule, of, law, was, not, the, predominant, consideration, of, the, athenian, legal, system, alfred, the, great, anglo, saxon, king, in, the, 9th, century, reformed, the, law, of, his, kingdom, and, assembled, a, law, code, the, doom, book, which, he, grounded, on, biblical, commandments, he, held, that, the, same, law, had, to, be, applied, to, all, persons, whether, rich, or, poor, friends, or, enemies, this, was, likely, inspired, by, leviticus, 19, 15, you, shall, do, no, iniquity, in, judgment, you, shall, not, favor, the, wretched, and, you, shall, not, defer, to, the, rich, in, righteousness, you, are, to, judge, your, fellow, in, 1215, archbishop, stephen, langton, gathered, the, barons, in, england, and, forced, king, john, and, future, sovereigns, and, magistrates, back, under, the, rule, of, law, preserving, ancient, liberties, by, magna, carta, in, return, for, exacting, taxes, the, influence, of, magna, carta, ebbs, and, wanes, across, centuries, the, weakening, of, royal, power, it, demonstrated, was, based, more, upon, the, instability, presented, by, contested, claims, than, thoughtful, adherence, to, constitutional, principles, until, 1534, the, church, excommunicated, people, for, violations, but, after, a, time, magna, carta, was, simply, replaced, by, other, statutes, considered, binding, upon, the, king, to, act, according, to, process, of, the, law, magna, carta, s, influence, is, considered, greatly, diminished, by, the, reign, of, henry, vi, after, the, wars, of, the, roses, the, ideas, contained, in, magna, carta, are, widely, considered, to, have, influenced, the, united, states, constitution, in, 1481, during, the, reign, of, ferdinand, ii, of, aragon, the, constituci, de, l, observan, a, was, approved, by, the, general, court, of, catalonia, establishing, the, submission, of, royal, power, included, its, officers, to, the, laws, of, the, principality, of, catalonia, the, first, known, use, of, this, english, phrase, occurred, around, 1500, another, early, example, of, the, phrase, rule, of, law, is, found, in, a, petition, to, james, i, of, england, in, 1610, from, the, house, of, commons, amongst, many, other, points, of, happiness, and, freedom, which, your, majesty, s, subjects, of, this, kingdom, have, enjoyed, under, your, royal, progenitors, kings, and, queens, of, this, realm, there, is, none, which, they, have, accounted, more, dear, and, precious, than, this, to, be, guided, and, governed, by, the, certain, rule, of, the, law, which, giveth, both, to, the, head, and, members, that, which, of, right, belongeth, to, them, and, not, by, any, uncertain, or, arbitrary, form, of, government, in, 1607, english, chief, justice, sir, edward, coke, said, in, the, case, of, prohibitions, according, to, his, own, report, that, the, law, was, the, golden, met, wand, and, measure, to, try, the, causes, of, the, subjects, and, which, protected, his, majesty, in, safety, and, peace, with, which, the, king, was, greatly, offended, and, said, that, then, he, should, be, under, the, law, which, was, treason, to, affirm, as, he, said, to, which, i, said, that, bracton, saith, quod, rex, non, debet, esse, sub, homine, sed, sub, deo, et, lege, that, the, king, ought, not, to, be, under, any, man, but, under, god, and, the, law, among, the, first, modern, authors, to, use, the, term, and, give, the, principle, theoretical, foundations, was, samuel, rutherford, in, lex, rex, 1644, the, title, latin, for, the, law, is, king, subverts, the, traditional, formulation, rex, lex, the, king, is, law, james, harrington, wrote, in, oceana, 1656, drawing, principally, on, aristotle, s, politics, that, among, forms, of, government, an, empire, of, laws, and, not, of, men, was, preferable, to, an, empire, of, men, and, not, of, laws, john, locke, also, discussed, this, issue, in, his, second, treatise, of, government, 1690, the, natural, liberty, of, man, is, to, be, free, from, any, superior, power, on, earth, and, not, to, be, under, the, will, or, legislative, authority, of, man, but, to, have, only, the, law, of, nature, for, his, rule, the, liberty, of, man, in, society, is, to, be, under, no, other, legislative, power, but, that, established, by, consent, in, the, commonwealth, nor, under, the, dominion, of, any, will, or, restraint, of, any, law, but, what, that, legislative, shall, enact, according, to, the, trust, put, in, it, freedom, then, is, not, what, sir, robert, filmer, tells, us, observations, a, 55, a, liberty, for, every, one, to, do, what, he, lists, to, live, as, he, pleases, and, not, to, be, tied, by, any, laws, but, freedom, of, men, under, government, is, to, have, a, standing, rule, to, live, by, common, to, every, one, of, that, society, and, made, by, the, legislative, power, erected, in, it, a, liberty, to, follow, my, own, will, in, all, things, where, the, rule, prescribes, not, and, not, to, be, subject, to, the, inconstant, uncertain, unknown, arbitrary, will, of, another, man, as, freedom, of, nature, is, to, be, under, no, other, restraint, but, the, law, of, nature, the, principle, was, also, discussed, by, montesquieu, in, the, spirit, of, law, 1748, the, phrase, rule, of, law, appears, in, samuel, johnson, s, dictionary, 1755, in, 1776, the, notion, that, no, one, is, above, the, law, was, popular, during, the, founding, of, the, united, states, for, example, thomas, paine, wrote, in, his, pamphlet, common, sense, that, in, america, the, law, is, king, for, as, in, absolute, governments, the, king, is, law, so, in, free, countries, the, law, ought, to, be, king, and, there, ought, to, be, no, other, in, 1780, john, adams, enshrined, this, principle, in, article, vi, of, the, declaration, of, rights, in, the, constitution, of, the, commonwealth, of, massachusetts, no, man, nor, corporation, or, association, of, men, have, any, other, title, to, obtain, advantages, or, particular, and, exclusive, privileges, distinct, from, those, of, the, community, than, what, arises, from, the, consideration, of, services, rendered, to, the, public, and, this, title, being, in, nature, neither, hereditary, nor, transmissible, to, children, or, descendants, or, relations, by, blood, the, idea, of, a, man, born, a, magistrate, lawgiver, or, judge, is, absurd, and, unnatural, the, influence, of, britain, france, and, the, united, states, contributed, to, spreading, the, principle, of, the, rule, of, law, to, other, countries, around, the, world, although, credit, for, popularizing, the, expression, the, rule, of, law, in, modern, times, is, usually, given, to, a, v, dicey, development, of, the, legal, concept, can, be, traced, through, history, to, many, ancient, civilizations, including, ancient, greece, mesopotamia, india, and, rome, the, idea, of, rule, of, law, is, often, regarded, as, a, modern, iteration, of, the, ideas, of, ancient, greek, philosophers, who, argued, that, the, best, form, of, government, was, rule, by, the, best, men, plato, advocated, a, benevolent, monarchy, ruled, by, an, idealized, philosopher, king, who, was, above, the, law, plato, nevertheless, hoped, that, the, best, men, would, be, good, at, respecting, established, laws, explaining, that, where, the, law, is, subject, to, some, other, authority, and, has, none, of, its, own, the, collapse, of, the, state, in, my, view, is, not, far, off, but, if, law, is, the, master, of, the, government, and, the, government, is, its, slave, then, the, situation, is, full, of, promise, and, men, enjoy, all, the, blessings, that, the, gods, shower, on, a, state, more, than, plato, attempted, to, do, aristotle, flatly, opposed, letting, the, highest, officials, wield, power, beyond, guarding, and, serving, the, laws, in, other, words, aristotle, advocated, the, rule, of, law, it, is, more, proper, that, law, should, govern, than, any, one, of, the, citizens, upon, the, same, principle, if, it, is, advantageous, to, place, the, supreme, power, in, some, particular, persons, they, should, be, appointed, to, be, only, guardians, and, the, servants, of, the, laws, the, roman, statesman, cicero, is, often, cited, as, saying, roughly, we, are, all, servants, of, the, laws, in, order, to, be, free, during, the, roman, republic, controversial, magistrates, might, be, put, on, trial, when, their, terms, of, office, expired, under, the, roman, empire, the, sovereign, was, personally, immune, legibus, solutus, but, those, with, grievances, could, sue, the, treasury, in, china, members, of, the, school, of, legalism, during, the, 3rd, century, bc, argued, for, using, law, as, a, tool, of, governance, but, they, promoted, rule, by, law, as, opposed, to, rule, of, law, meaning, that, they, placed, the, aristocrats, and, emperor, above, the, law, in, contrast, the, huang, lao, school, of, daoism, rejected, legal, positivism, in, favor, of, a, natural, law, that, even, the, ruler, would, be, subject, to, the, oxford, english, dictionary, has, defined, rule, of, law, this, way, the, authority, and, influence, of, law, in, society, esp, when, viewed, as, a, constraint, on, individual, and, institutional, behaviour, hence, the, principle, whereby, all, members, of, a, society, including, those, in, government, are, considered, equally, subject, to, publicly, disclosed, legal, codes, and, processes, rule, of, law, implies, that, every, citizen, is, subject, to, the, law, it, stands, in, contrast, to, the, idea, that, the, ruler, is, above, the, law, for, example, by, divine, right, despite, wide, use, by, politicians, judges, and, academics, the, rule, of, law, has, been, described, as, an, exceedingly, elusive, notion, among, modern, legal, theorists, one, finds, that, at, least, two, principal, conceptions, of, the, rule, of, law, can, be, identified, a, formalist, or, thin, definition, and, a, substantive, or, thick, definition, one, occasionally, encounters, a, third, functional, conception, formalist, definitions, of, the, rule, of, law, do, not, make, a, judgment, about, the, justness, of, law, itself, but, define, specific, procedural, attributes, that, a, legal, framework, must, have, in, order, to, be, in, compliance, with, the, rule, of, law, substantive, conceptions, of, the, rule, of, law, go, beyond, this, and, include, certain, substantive, rights, that, are, said, to, be, based, on, or, derived, from, the, rule, of, law, most, legal, theorists, believe, that, the, rule, of, law, has, purely, formal, characteristics, for, instance, such, theorists, claim, that, law, requires, generality, general, rules, that, apply, to, classes, of, persons, and, behaviors, as, opposed, to, individuals, publicity, no, secret, laws, prospective, application, little, or, no, retroactive, laws, consistency, no, contradictory, laws, equality, applied, equally, throughout, all, society, and, certainty, certainty, of, application, for, a, given, situation, but, formalists, contend, that, there, are, no, requirements, with, regard, to, the, content, of, the, law, others, including, a, few, legal, theorists, believe, that, the, rule, of, law, necessarily, entails, protection, of, individual, rights, within, legal, theory, these, two, approaches, to, the, rule, of, law, are, seen, as, the, two, basic, alternatives, respectively, labelled, the, formal, and, substantive, approaches, still, there, are, other, views, as, well, some, believe, that, democracy, is, part, of, the, rule, of, law, the, formal, interpretation, is, more, widespread, than, the, substantive, interpretation, formalists, hold, that, the, law, must, be, prospective, well, known, and, have, characteristics, of, generality, equality, and, certainty, other, than, that, the, formal, view, contains, no, requirements, as, to, the, content, of, the, law, this, formal, approach, allows, laws, that, protect, democracy, and, individual, rights, but, recognizes, the, existence, of, rule, of, law, in, countries, that, do, not, necessarily, have, such, laws, protecting, democracy, or, individual, rights, the, best, known, arguments, for, the, formal, interpretation, have, been, made, by, a, v, dicey, f, a, hayek, joseph, raz, and, joseph, unger, the, substantive, interpretation, preferred, by, dworkin, laws, and, allan, holds, that, the, rule, of, law, intrinsically, protects, some, or, all, individual, rights, the, functional, interpretation, of, the, term, rule, of, law, consistent, with, the, traditional, english, meaning, contrasts, the, rule, of, law, with, the, rule, of, man, according, to, the, functional, view, a, society, in, which, government, officers, have, a, great, deal, of, discretion, has, a, low, degree, of, rule, of, law, whereas, a, society, in, which, government, officers, have, little, discretion, has, a, high, degree, of, rule, of, law, upholding, the, rule, of, law, can, sometimes, require, the, punishment, of, those, who, commit, offenses, that, are, justifiable, under, natural, law, but, not, statutory, law, the, rule, of, law, is, thus, somewhat, at, odds, with, flexibility, even, when, flexibility, may, be, preferable, the, ancient, concept, of, rule, of, law, can, be, distinguished, from, rule, by, law, according, to, political, science, professor, li, shuguang, the, difference, is, that, under, the, rule, of, law, the, law, is, preeminent, and, can, serve, as, a, check, against, the, abuse, of, power, under, rule, by, law, the, law, is, a, mere, tool, for, a, government, that, suppresses, in, a, legalistic, fashion, the, rule, of, law, has, been, considered, one, of, the, key, dimensions, that, determine, the, quality, and, good, governance, of, a, country, research, like, the, worldwide, governance, indicators, defines, the, rule, of, law, as, the, extent, to, which, agents, have, confidence, and, abide, by, the, rules, of, society, and, in, particular, the, quality, of, contract, enforcement, the, police, and, the, courts, as, well, as, the, likelihood, of, crime, or, violence, based, on, this, definition, the, worldwide, governance, indicators, project, has, developed, aggregate, measurements, for, the, rule, of, law, in, more, than, 200, countries, as, seen, in, the, map, at, right, other, evaluations, such, as, the, world, justice, project, rule, of, law, index, show, that, adherence, to, rule, of, law, fell, in, 61, of, countries, in, 2022, globally, this, means, that, 4, 4, billion, people, live, in, countries, where, rule, of, law, declined, in, 2021, the, preamble, of, the, rule, of, law, european, convention, for, the, protection, of, human, rights, and, fundamental, freedoms, says, the, governments, of, european, countries, which, are, like, minded, and, have, a, common, heritage, of, political, traditions, ideals, freedom, and, the, rule, of, law, in, france, and, germany, the, concepts, of, rule, of, law, etat, de, droit, and, rechtsstaat, respectively, are, analogous, to, the, principles, of, constitutional, supremacy, and, protection, of, fundamental, rights, from, public, authorities, see, public, law, particularly, the, legislature, france, was, one, of, the, early, pioneers, of, the, ideas, of, the, rule, of, law, the, german, interpretation, is, more, rigid, but, similar, to, that, of, france, and, the, united, kingdom, finland, s, constitution, explicitly, requires, rule, of, law, by, stipulating, that, the, exercise, of, public, powers, shall, be, based, on, an, act, in, all, public, activity, the, law, shall, be, strictly, observed, in, the, united, kingdom, the, rule, of, law, is, a, long, standing, principle, of, the, way, the, country, is, governed, dating, from, england, s, magna, carta, in, 1215, and, the, bill, of, rights, 1689, in, the, 19th, century, classic, work, introduction, to, the, study, of, the, law, of, the, constitution, 1885, a, v, dicey, a, constitutional, scholar, and, lawyer, wrote, of, the, twin, pillars, of, the, british, constitution, the, rule, of, law, and, parliamentary, sovereignty, all, government, officers, of, the, united, states, including, the, president, the, justices, of, the, supreme, court, state, judges, and, legislators, and, all, members, of, congress, pledge, first, and, foremost, to, uphold, the, constitution, these, oaths, affirm, that, the, rule, of, law, is, superior, to, the, rule, of, any, human, leader, at, the, same, time, the, federal, government, has, considerable, discretion, the, legislative, branch, is, free, to, decide, what, statutes, it, will, write, as, long, as, it, stays, within, its, enumerated, powers, and, respects, the, constitutionally, protected, rights, of, individuals, likewise, the, judicial, branch, has, a, degree, of, judicial, discretion, and, the, executive, branch, also, has, various, discretionary, powers, including, prosecutorial, discretion, the, july, 1, 2024, trump, v, united, states, supreme, court, decision, held, former, presidents, have, partial, immunity, for, crimes, committed, using, the, powers, of, their, office, legal, scholars, have, warned, of, the, negative, impact, of, this, decision, on, the, status, of, rule, of, law, in, the, united, states, prior, to, that, in, 1973, and, 2000, the, office, of, legal, counsel, within, the, department, of, justice, issued, opinions, saying, that, a, sitting, president, cannot, be, indicted, or, prosecuted, but, it, is, constitutional, to, indict, and, try, a, former, president, for, the, same, offenses, for, which, the, president, was, impeached, by, the, house, of, representatives, and, acquitted, by, the, senate, under, the, impeachment, disqualification, clause, of, article, i, section, iii, the, question, of, whether, a, president, may, only, be, criminally, charged, if, they, have, first, survived, an, impeachment, is, presently, before, the, district, of, columbia, circuit, court, of, appeals, for, decision, in, the, case, of, united, states, of, america, versus, donald, j, trump, docket, no, 23, 3228, scholars, continue, to, debate, whether, the, u, s, constitution, adopted, a, particular, interpretation, of, the, rule, of, law, and, if, so, which, one, for, example, john, harrison, asserts, that, the, word, law, in, the, constitution, is, simply, defined, as, that, which, is, legally, binding, rather, than, being, defined, by, formal, or, substantive, criteria, and, therefore, judges, do, not, have, discretion, to, decide, that, laws, fail, to, satisfy, such, unwritten, and, vague, criteria, law, professor, frederick, mark, gedicks, disagrees, writing, that, cicero, augustine, thomas, aquinas, and, the, framers, of, the, u, s, constitution, believed, that, an, unjust, law, was, not, really, a, law, at, all, some, modern, scholars, contend, that, the, rule, of, law, has, been, corroded, during, the, past, century, by, the, instrumental, view, of, law, promoted, by, legal, realists, such, as, oliver, wendell, holmes, and, roscoe, pound, for, example, brian, tamanaha, asserts, the, rule, of, law, is, a, centuries, old, ideal, but, the, notion, that, law, is, a, means, to, an, end, became, entrenched, only, in, the, course, of, the, nineteenth, and, twentieth, centuries, others, argue, that, the, rule, of, law, has, survived, but, was, transformed, to, allow, for, the, exercise, of, discretion, by, administrators, for, much, of, american, history, the, dominant, notion, of, the, rule, of, law, in, this, setting, has, been, some, version, of, a, v, dicey, s, no, man, is, punishable, or, can, be, lawfully, made, to, suffer, in, body, or, goods, except, for, a, distinct, breach, of, law, established, in, the, ordinary, legal, manner, before, the, ordinary, courts, of, the, land, that, is, individuals, should, be, able, to, challenge, an, administrative, order, by, bringing, suit, in, a, court, of, general, jurisdiction, as, the, dockets, of, worker, compensation, commissions, public, utility, commissions, and, other, agencies, burgeoned, it, soon, became, apparent, that, letting, judges, decide, for, themselves, all, the, facts, in, a, dispute, such, as, the, extent, of, an, injury, in, a, worker, s, compensation, case, would, overwhelm, the, courts, and, destroy, the, advantages, of, specialization, that, led, to, the, creation, of, administrative, agencies, in, the, first, place, even, charles, evans, hughes, a, chief, justice, of, the, united, states, believed, you, must, have, administration, and, you, must, have, administration, by, administrative, officers, by, 1941, a, compromise, had, emerged, if, administrators, adopted, procedures, that, more, or, less, tracked, the, ordinary, legal, manner, of, the, courts, further, review, of, the, facts, by, the, ordinary, courts, of, the, land, was, unnecessary, that, is, if, you, had, your, day, in, commission, the, rule, of, law, did, not, require, a, further, day, in, court, thus, dicey, s, rule, of, law, was, recast, into, a, purely, procedural, form, james, wilson, said, during, the, philadelphia, convention, in, 1787, that, laws, may, be, unjust, may, be, unwise, may, be, dangerous, may, be, destructive, and, yet, not, be, so, unconstitutional, as, to, justify, the, judges, in, refusing, to, give, them, effect, george, mason, agreed, that, judges, could, declare, an, unconstitutional,

of, executive, accountability, to, legal, authority, in, canadian, law, it, means, that, the, relationship, between, the, state, and, the, individual, must, be, regulated, by, law, and, that, the, constitution, binds, all, governments, both, federal, and, provincial, including, the, executive, with, the, adoption, of, the, canadian, charter, of, rights, and, freedoms, the, canadian, system, of, government, was, transformed, to, a, significant, extent, from, a, system, of, parliamentary, supremacy, to, one, of, constitutional, supremacy, the, principle, of, the, rule, of, law, and, constitutionalism, is, aided, by, acknowledging, that, the, constitution, is, entrenched, beyond, simple, majority, rule, however, the, notwithstanding, clause, operates, to, provide, a, limited,

because, the, rule, of, law, is, important, to, foreign, investors, and, to, economic, development, it, remains, unclear, whether, the, rule, of, law, in, countries, like, china, and, vietnam, will, be, limited, to, commercial, matters, or, will, spill, into, other, areas, as, well, and, if, so, whether, that, spillover, will, enhance, prospects, for, related, values, such, as, democracy, and, human, rights, in, china, the, phrase, f, zh, which, can, be, translated, as, rule, of, law, means, using, the, law, as, an, instrument, to, facilitate, social, control, late, qing, dynasty, legal,

western, values, have, corrupted, many, people, s, understanding, of, the, rule, of, law, the, ccp, has, simultaneously, endorsed, governing, the, country, in, accordance, with, the, rule, of, law, these, factors, likely, suggest, that, the, ccp, is, creating, a, rule, of, law, with, chinese, characteristics, which, may, simply, entail, modifying, the, western, notion, of, rule, of, law, to, best, match, china, s, unique, political, social, and, historical, conditions, as, document, 9, suggests, the, ccp, does, not, see, judicial, independence, separation, of, power, or, constitutional, forms, of, governance, as, defined, by, western, society, to, suit, china, s, unique, form, of, governance, this, unique, version, of, rule, of, law, with, chinese, characteristics, has, led, to,

aspects, of, the, socialist, rule, of, law, are, 1, that, the, political, and, legal, organs, including, courts, the, police, and, the, procuratorate, must, believe, in, the, law, and, uphold, the, law, and, 2, all, political, and, legal, officials, must, follow, the, communist, party, 115, in, thailand, a, kingdom, that, has, had, a, constitution, since, the, initial, attempt, to, overthrow,
