the, law, of, evidence, also, known, as, the, rules, of, evidence, encompasses, the, rules, and, legal, principles, that, govern, the, proof, of, facts, in, a, legal, proceeding, these, rules, determine, what, evidence, must, or, must, not, be, considered, by, the, trier, of, fact, in, reaching, its, decision, the, trier, of, fact, is, a, judge, in, bench, trials, or, the, jury, in, any, cases, involving, a, jury, the, law, of, evidence, is, also, concerned, with, the, quantum, amount, quality, and, type, of, proof, needed, to, prevail, in, litigation, the, rules, vary, depending, upon, whether, the, venue, is, a, criminal, court, civil, court, or, family, court, and, they, vary, by, jurisdiction, the, quantum, of, evidence, is, the, amount, of, evidence, needed, the, quality, of, proof, is, how, reliable, such, evidence, should, be, considered, important, rules, that, govern, admissibility, concern, hearsay, authentication, relevance, privilege, witnesses, opinions, expert, testimony, identification, and, rules, of, physical, evidence, there, are, various, standards, of, evidence, standards, showing, how, strong, the, evidence, must, be, to, meet, the, legal, burden, of, proof, in, a, given, situation, ranging, from, reasonable, suspicion, to, preponderance, of, the, evidence, clear, and, convincing, evidence, or, beyond, a, reasonable, doubt, there, are, several, types, of, evidence, depending, on, the, form, or, source, evidence, governs, the, use, of, testimony, e, g, oral, or, written, statements, such, as, an, affidavit, exhibits, e, g, physical, objects, documentary, material, or, demonstrative, evidence, which, are, admissible, i, e, allowed, to, be, considered, by, the, trier, of, fact, such, as, jury, in, a, judicial, or, administrative, proceeding, e, g, a, court, of, law, when, a, dispute, whether, relating, to, a, civil, or, criminal, matter, reaches, the, court, there, will, always, be, a, number, of, issues, which, one, party, will, have, to, prove, in, order, to, persuade, the, court, to, find, in, their, favour, the, law, must, ensure, certain, guidelines, are, set, out, in, order, to, ensure, that, evidence, presented, to, the, court, can, be, regarded, as, trustworthy, the, old, testament, demanded, at, least, two, witnesses, for, conviction, of, a, crime, ancient, roman, law, allowed, freedom, to, judges, to, evaluate, evidence, but, insisted, that, proof, is, incumbent, on, the, party, who, affirms, a, fact, not, on, him, who, denies, it, and, no, one, should, be, convicted, on, suspicion, medieval, roman, law, developed, an, elaborate, grading, of, degrees, of, evidence, building, on, the, biblical, two, witness, rule, it, concluded, that, a, single, witness, or, private, documents, could, constitute, half, proof, which, though, insufficient, for, conviction, might, justify, torture, to, extract, further, evidence, 26, 7, 59, because, evidence, in, the, continental, civil, law, system, was, evaluated, by, judges, rather, than, juries, that, system, did, not, develop, exclusionary, rules, of, evidence, in, the, way, english, law, did, a, distinct, feature, of, english, common, law, historically, was, the, role, of, the, jury, as, a, finder, of, fact, as, opposed, to, the, role, of, the, judge, as, finder, of, law, the, creation, of, modern, jury, trials, in, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, necessitated, rules, of, evidence, to, regulate, what, testimony, and, other, evidence, could, be, put, before, the, jury, while, much, of, the, early, common, law, evidence, rules, came, from, judicial, decisions, the, english, parliament, also, played, a, role, in, 1677, parliament, and, the, crown, enacted, the, statute, of, frauds, and, perjuries, prohibiting, plaintiffs, from, alleging, certain, contractual, breaches, to, the, jury, unless, accompanied, by, a, signed, written, instrument, another, early, evidence, rule, was, the, prohibition, on, hearsay, the, admission, of, an, out, of, court, statement, to, prove, the, truth, of, what, is, asserted, in, the, early, 19th, century, chief, justice, lord, mansfield, of, the, court, of, common, pleas, stated, in, scotland, and, most, of, the, continental, states, the, judges, determine, upon, the, facts, in, dispute, as, well, as, upon, the, law, and, they, think, there, is, no, danger, in, their, listening, to, evidence, of, hearsay, because, when, they, come, to, consider, their, judgment, on, the, merits, of, the, case, they, can, trust, themselves, entirely, to, disregard, the, hearsay, evidence, or, to, give, it, any, little, weight, which, it, may, seem, to, deserve, but, in, england, where, the, jury, are, the, sole, judges, of, the, fact, hearsay, evidence, is, properly, excluded, because, no, man, can, tell, what, effect, it, might, have, upon, their, minds, hearsay, rules, have, subsequently, been, updated, numerous, times, most, recently, in, england, and, wales, the, civil, evidence, act, 1995, section, 1, specifically, allows, for, admission, of, hearsay, evidence, legislation, also, allows, for, hearsay, evidence, to, be, used, in, criminal, proceedings, which, makes, it, possible, for, the, accuser, to, induce, friends, or, family, to, give, false, evidence, in, support, of, their, accusations, because, normally, it, would, be, rejected, by, the, presiding, authority, or, judge, there, are, several, examples, where, presiding, authorities, are, not, bound, by, the, rules, of, evidence, these, include, the, military, tribunals, in, the, united, states, and, tribunals, used, in, australia, to, try, health, professionals, in, every, jurisdiction, based, on, the, english, common, law, tradition, evidence, must, conform, to, a, number, of, rules, and, restrictions, to, be, admissible, evidence, must, be, relevant, that, is, it, must, be, directed, at, proving, or, disproving, a, legal, element, however, the, relevance, of, evidence, is, ordinarily, a, necessary, condition, but, not, a, sufficient, condition, for, the, admissibility, of, evidence, for, example, relevant, evidence, may, be, excluded, if, it, is, unfairly, prejudicial, confusing, or, the, relevance, or, irrelevance, of, evidence, cannot, be, determined, by, logical, analysis, there, is, also, general, agreement, that, assessment, of, relevance, or, irrelevance, involves, or, requires, judgements, about, probabilities, or, uncertainties, beyond, that, there, is, little, agreement, many, legal, scholars, and, judges, agree, that, ordinary, reasoning, or, common, sense, reasoning, plays, an, important, role, there, is, less, agreement, about, whether, or, not, judgements, of, relevance, or, irrelevance, are, defensible, only, if, the, reasoning, that, supports, such, judgements, is, made, fully, explicit, however, most, trial, judges, would, reject, any, such, requirement, and, would, say, that, some, judgements, can, and, must, rest, partly, on, unarticulated, and, unarticulable, hunches, and, intuitions, however, there, is, general, though, implicit, agreement, that, the, relevance, of, at, least, some, types, of, expert, evidence, particularly, evidence, from, the, hard, sciences, requires, particularly, rigorous, or, in, any, event, more, arcane, reasoning, than, is, usually, needed, or, expected, there, is, a, general, agreement, that, judgments, of, relevance, are, largely, within, the, discretion, of, the, trial, court, although, relevance, rulings, that, lead, to, the, exclusion, of, evidence, are, more, likely, to, be, reversed, on, appeal, than, are, relevance, rulings, that, lead, to, the, admission, of, evidence, according, to, rule, 401, of, the, federal, rules, of, evidence, fre, evidence, is, relevant, if, it, has, the, tendency, to, make, the, existence, of, any, fact, that, is, of, consequence, to, the, determination, of, the, action, more, probable, or, less, probable, than, it, would, be, without, the, evidence, federal, rule, 403, allows, relevant, evidence, to, be, excluded, if, its, probative, value, is, substantially, outweighed, by, the, danger, of, unfair, prejudice, if, it, leads, to, confusion, of, the, issues, if, it, is, misleading, or, if, it, is, a, waste, of, time, california, evidence, code, section, 352, also, allows, for, exclusion, to, avoid, substantial, danger, of, undue, prejudice, for, example, evidence, that, the, victim, of, a, car, accident, was, apparently, a, liar, cheater, womanizer, and, a, man, of, low, morals, was, unduly, prejudicial, and, irrelevant, to, whether, he, had, a, valid, product, liability, claim, against, the, manufacturer, of, the, tires, on, his, van, which, had, rolled, over, resulting, in, severe, brain, damage, the, united, states, has, a, very, complicated, system, of, evidentiary, rules, for, example, john, wigmore, s, celebrated, treatise, on, it, filled, ten, volumes, james, bradley, thayer, reported, in, 1898, that, even, english, lawyers, were, surprised, by, the, complexity, of, american, evidence, law, such, as, its, reliance, on, exceptions, to, preserve, evidentiary, objections, for, appeal, some, legal, experts, notably, stanford, legal, historian, lawrence, friedman, have, argued, that, the, complexity, of, american, evidence, law, arises, from, two, factors, 1, the, right, of, american, defendants, to, have, findings, of, fact, made, by, a, jury, in, practically, all, criminal, cases, as, well, as, many, civil, cases, and, 2, the, widespread, consensus, that, tight, limitations, on, the, admissibility, of, evidence, are, necessary, to, prevent, a, jury, of, untrained, laypersons, from, being, swayed, by, irrelevant, distractions, in, professor, friedman, s, words, a, trained, judge, would, not, need, all, these, rules, and, indeed, the, law, of, evidence, in, systems, that, lack, a, jury, is, short, sweet, and, clear, however, friedman, s, views, are, characteristic, of, an, earlier, generation, of, legal, scholars, the, majority, of, people, now, reject, the, formerly, popular, proposition, that, the, institution, of, trial, by, jury, is, the, main, reason, for, the, existence, of, rules, of, evidence, even, in, countries, such, as, the, united, states, and, australia, they, argue, that, other, variables, are, at, work, under, english, law, evidence, that, would, otherwise, be, admissible, at, trial, may, be, excluded, at, the, discretion, of, the, trial, judge, if, it, would, be, unfair, to, the, defendant, to, admit, it, evidence, of, a, confession, may, be, excluded, because, it, was, obtained, by, oppression, or, because, the, confession, was, made, in, consequence, of, anything, said, or, done, to, the, defendant, that, would, be, likely, to, make, the, confession, unreliable, in, these, circumstances, it, would, be, open, to, the, trial, judge, to, exclude, the, evidence, of, the, confession, under, section, 78, 1, of, the, police, and, criminal, evidence, act, 1984, pace, or, under, section, 73, pace, or, under, common, law, although, in, practice, the, confession, would, be, excluded, under, section, 76, pace, other, admissible, evidence, may, be, excluded, at, the, discretion, of, the, trial, judge, under, 78, pace, or, at, common, law, if, the, judge, can, be, persuaded, that, having, regard, to, all, the, circumstances, including, how, the, evidence, was, obtained, admission, of, the, evidence, would, have, such, an, adverse, effect, on, the, fairness, of, the, proceedings, that, the, court, ought, not, to, admit, it, in, the, united, states, and, other, countries, evidence, may, be, excluded, from, a, trial, if, it, is, the, result, of, illegal, activity, by, law, enforcement, such, as, a, search, conducted, without, a, warrant, such, illegal, evidence, is, known, as, the, fruit, of, the, poisonous, tree, and, is, normally, not, permitted, at, trial, certain, kinds, of, evidence, such, as, documentary, evidence, are, subject, to, the, requirement, that, the, offeror, provide, the, trial, judge, with, a, certain, amount, of, evidence, which, need, not, be, much, and, it, need, not, be, very, strong, suggesting, that, the, offered, item, of, tangible, evidence, e, g, a, document, a, gun, is, what, the, offeror, claims, it, is, this, authentication, requirement, has, import, primarily, in, jury, trials, if, evidence, of, authenticity, is, lacking, in, a, bench, trial, the, trial, judge, will, simply, dismiss, the, evidence, as, unpersuasive, or, irrelevant, other, kinds, of, evidence, can, be, self, authenticating, and, require, nothing, to, prove, that, the, item, is, tangible, evidence, examples, of, self, authenticating, evidence, includes, signed, and, certified, public, documents, newspapers, and, acknowledged, documents, in, systems, of, proof, based, on, the, english, common, law, tradition, almost, all, evidence, must, be, sponsored, by, a, witness, who, has, sworn, or, solemnly, affirmed, to, tell, the, truth, the, bulk, of, the, law, of, evidence, regulates, the, types, of, evidence, that, may, be, sought, from, witnesses, and, the, manner, in, which, the, interrogation, of, witnesses, is, conducted, such, as, during, direct, examination, and, cross, examination, of, witnesses, otherwise, types, of, evidentiary, rules, specify, the, standards, of, persuasion, e, g, proof, beyond, a, reasonable, doubt, that, a, trier, of, fact, whether, judge, or, jury, must, apply, when, it, assesses, evidence, today, all, persons, are, presumed, to, be, qualified, to, serve, as, witnesses, in, trials, and, other, legal, proceedings, and, all, persons, are, also, presumed, to, have, a, legal, obligation, to, serve, as, witnesses, if, their, testimony, is, sought, however, legal, rules, sometimes, exempt, people, from, the, obligation, to, give, evidence, and, legal, rules, disqualify, people, from, serving, as, witnesses, under, some, circumstances, privilege, rules, give, the, holder, of, the, privilege, a, right, to, prevent, a, witness, from, giving, testimony, these, privileges, are, ordinarily, but, not, always, designed, to, protect, socially, valued, types, of, confidential, communications, some, of, the, privileges, that, are, often, recognized, in, various, u, s, jurisdictions, are, spousal, privilege, attorney, client, privilege, doctor, patient, privilege, state, secrets, privilege, and, clergy, penitent, privilege, a, variety, of, additional, privileges, are, recognized, in, different, jurisdictions, but, the, list, of, recognized, privileges, varies, from, jurisdiction, to, jurisdiction, for, example, some, jurisdictions, recognize, a, social, worker, client, privilege, and, other, jurisdictions, do, not, witness, competence, rules, are, legal, rules, that, specify, circumstances, under, which, persons, are, ineligible, to, serve, as, witnesses, for, example, neither, a, judge, nor, a, juror, is, competent, to, testify, in, a, trial, in, which, the, judge, or, the, juror, serves, in, that, capacity, and, in, jurisdictions, with, a, dead, man, statute, a, person, is, deemed, not, competent, to, testify, as, to, statements, of, or, transactions, with, a, deceased, opposing, party, often, a, law, will, govern, the, rules, affecting, the, giving, of, evidence, by, witnesses, in, court, an, example, is, the, evidence, act, nsw, 1995, which, sets, out, the, procedures, for, witnesses, to, follow, in, new, south, wales, australia, hearsay, is, one, of, the, largest, and, most, complex, areas, of, the, law, of, evidence, in, common, law, jurisdictions, the, default, rule, is, that, hearsay, evidence, is, inadmissible, hearsay, is, an, out, of, court, statement, offered, to, prove, the, truth, of, the, matter, asserted, a, party, is, offering, a, statement, to, prove, the, truth, of, the, matter, asserted, if, the, party, is, trying, to, prove, that, the, assertion, made, by, the, declarant, the, maker, of, the, out, of, trial, statement, is, true, for, example, prior, to, trial, bob, says, jane, went, to, the, store, if, the, party, offering, this, statement, as, evidence, at, trial, is, trying, to, prove, that, jane, actually, went, to, the, store, the, statement, is, being, offered, to, prove, the, truth, of, the, matter, asserted, however, at, both, common, law, and, under, evidence, codifications, such, as, the, federal, rules, of, evidence, there, are, dozens, of, exemptions, from, and, exceptions, to, the, hearsay, rule, direct, evidence, is, any, evidence, that, directly, proves, or, disproves, a, fact, the, most, well, known, type, of, direct, evidence, is, a, testimony, from, an, eyewitness, in, eye, witness, testimonies, the, witness, states, exactly, what, they, experienced, saw, or, heard, direct, evidence, may, also, be, found, in, the, form, of, documents, in, cases, that, involve, a, breach, of, contract, the, contract, itself, would, be, considered, direct, evidence, as, it, can, directly, prove, or, disprove, that, there, was, breach, of, contract, circumstantial, evidence, however, is, evidence, that, does, not, point, directly, to, a, fact, and, requires, an, inference, in, order, to, prove, that, fact, a, common, example, of, the, distinction, between, direct, and, circumstantial, evidence, involves, a, person, who, comes, into, a, building, when, it, may, be, raining, if, the, person, declares, it, s, raining, outside, that, statement, is, direct, evidence, that, it, is, raining, if, the, person, is, carrying, a, wet, umbrella, and, he, is, wearing, a, wet, rain, coat, those, observations, are, circumstantial, evidence, that, it, is, raining, outside, different, types, of, proceedings, require, parties, to, meet, different, burdens, of, proof, the, typical, examples, being, beyond, a, reasonable, doubt, clear, and, convincing, evidence, and, preponderance, of, the, evidence, many, jurisdictions, have, burden, shifting, provisions, which, require, that, if, one, party, produces, evidence, tending, to, prove, a, certain, point, the, burden, shifts, to, the, other, party, to, produce, superior, evidence, tending, to, disprove, it, one, special, category, of, information, in, this, area, includes, things, of, which, the, court, may, take, judicial, notice, this, category, covers, matters, that, are, so, well, known, that, the, court, may, deem, them, proved, without, the, introduction, of, any, evidence, for, example, if, a, defendant, is, alleged, to, have, illegally, transported, goods, across, a, state, line, by, driving, them, from, boston, to, los, angeles, the, court, may, take, judicial, notice, of, the, fact, that, it, is, impossible, to, drive, from, boston, to, los, angeles, without, crossing, a, number, of, state, lines, in, a, civil, case, where, the, court, takes, judicial, notice, of, the, fact, that, fact, is, deemed, conclusively, proved, in, a, criminal, case, however, the, defense, may, always, submit, evidence, to, rebut, a, point, for, which, judicial, notice, has, been, taken, some, rules, that, affect, the, admissibility, of, evidence, are, nonetheless, considered, to, belong, to, other, areas, of, law, these, include, the, exclusionary, rule, of, criminal, procedure, which, prohibits, the, admission, in, a, criminal, trial, of, evidence, gained, by, unconstitutional, means, and, the, parol, evidence, rule, of, contract, law, which, prohibits, the, admission, of, extrinsic, evidence, of, the, contents, of, a, written, contract, in, countries, that, follow, the, civil, law, system, evidence, is, normally, studied, as, a, branch, of, procedural, law, all, american, law, schools, offer, a, course, in, evidence, and, most, require, the, subject, either, as, a, first, year, class, or, as, an, upper, level, class, or, as, a, prerequisite, to, later, courses, furthermore, evidence, is, heavily, tested, on, the, multistate, bar, examination, mbe, approximately, one, sixth, of, the, questions, asked, in, that, test, will, be, in, the, area, of, evidence, the, mbe, predominantly, tests, evidence, under, the, federal, rules, of, evidence, giving, little, attention, to, matters, on, which, the, law, of, different, states, is, likely, to, be, inconsistent, acts, that, conceal, corrupt, or, destroy, evidence, can, be, considered, spoliation, of, evidence, and, or, tampering, with, evidence, spoliation, is, usually, the, civil, law, due, process, variant, may, involve, intent, or, negligence, may, affect, the, outcome, of, a, case, in, which, the, evidence, is, material, and, may, or, may, not, result, in, criminal, prosecution, tampering, is, usually, the, criminal, law, variant, in, which, a, person, alters, conceals, falsifies, or, destroys, evidence, to, interfere, with, a, law, enforcement, governmental, or, regulatory, investigation, and, is, usually, defined, as, a, crime, parallel, construction, is, the, creation, of, an, untruthful, but, plausible, explanation, for, how, the, evidence, came, to, be, held, which, hides, its, true, origins, either, to, protect, sources, and, methods, used, or, to, avoid, the, evidence, being, excluded, as, unlawfully, obtained, depending, on, the, circumstances, acts, to, conceal, or, destroy, evidence, or, misrepresent, its, true, origins, might, be, considered, both, tampering, and, spoliation
