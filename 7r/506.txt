rights, are, legal, social, or, ethical, principles, of, freedom, or, entitlement, that, is, rights, are, the, fundamental, normative, rules, about, what, is, allowed, of, people, or, owed, to, people, according, to, some, legal, system, social, convention, or, ethical, theory, rights, are, of, essential, importance, in, such, disciplines, as, law, and, ethics, especially, theories, of, justice, and, deontology, the, history, of, social, conflicts, has, often, involved, attempts, to, define, and, redefine, rights, according, to, the, stanford, encyclopedia, of, philosophy, rights, structure, the, form, of, governments, the, content, of, laws, and, the, shape, of, morality, as, it, is, currently, perceived, some, thinkers, see, rights, in, only, one, sense, while, others, accept, that, both, senses, have, a, measure, of, validity, there, has, been, considerable, philosophical, debate, about, these, senses, throughout, history, for, example, jeremy, bentham, believed, that, legal, rights, were, the, essence, of, rights, and, he, denied, the, existence, of, natural, rights, whereas, thomas, aquinas, held, that, rights, purported, by, positive, law, but, not, grounded, in, natural, law, were, not, properly, rights, at, all, but, only, a, facade, or, pretense, of, rights, liberty, rights, and, claim, rights, are, the, inverse, of, one, another, a, person, has, a, liberty, right, permitting, him, to, do, something, only, if, there, is, no, other, person, who, has, a, claim, right, forbidding, him, from, doing, so, likewise, if, a, person, has, a, claim, right, against, someone, else, then, that, other, person, s, liberty, is, limited, for, example, a, person, has, a, liberty, right, to, walk, down, a, sidewalk, and, can, decide, freely, whether, or, not, to, do, so, since, there, is, no, obligation, either, to, do, so, or, to, refrain, from, doing, so, but, pedestrians, may, have, an, obligation, not, to, walk, on, certain, lands, such, as, other, people, s, private, property, to, which, those, other, people, have, a, claim, right, so, a, person, s, liberty, right, of, walking, extends, precisely, to, the, point, where, another, s, claim, right, limits, his, or, her, freedom, in, one, sense, a, right, is, a, permission, to, do, something, or, an, entitlement, to, a, specific, service, or, treatment, from, others, and, these, rights, have, been, called, positive, rights, however, in, another, sense, rights, may, allow, or, require, inaction, and, these, are, called, negative, rights, they, permit, or, require, doing, nothing, for, example, in, some, countries, e, g, the, united, states, citizens, have, the, positive, right, to, vote, and, they, have, the, negative, right, to, not, vote, people, can, choose, not, to, vote, in, a, given, election, without, punishment, in, other, countries, e, g, australia, however, citizens, have, a, positive, right, to, vote, but, they, do, not, have, a, negative, right, to, not, vote, since, voting, is, compulsory, accordingly, though, similarly, named, positive, and, negative, rights, should, not, be, confused, with, active, rights, which, encompass, privileges, and, powers, and, passive, rights, which, encompass, claims, and, immunities, there, can, be, tension, between, individual, and, group, rights, a, classic, instance, in, which, group, and, individual, rights, clash, is, conflicts, between, unions, and, their, members, for, example, individual, members, of, a, union, may, wish, a, wage, higher, than, the, union, negotiated, wage, but, are, prevented, from, making, further, requests, in, a, so, called, closed, shop, which, has, a, union, security, agreement, only, the, union, has, a, right, to, decide, matters, for, the, individual, union, members, such, as, wage, rates, so, do, the, supposed, individual, rights, of, the, workers, prevail, about, the, proper, wage, or, do, the, group, rights, of, the, union, regarding, the, proper, wage, prevail, the, austrian, school, of, economics, holds, that, only, individuals, think, feel, and, act, whether, or, not, members, of, any, abstract, group, the, society, should, thus, according, to, economists, of, the, school, be, analyzed, starting, from, the, individual, this, methodology, is, called, methodological, individualism, and, is, used, by, the, economists, to, justify, individual, rights, similarly, the, author, ayn, rand, argued, that, only, individuals, have, rights, according, to, her, philosophy, known, as, objectivism, however, others, have, argued, that, there, are, situations, in, which, a, group, of, persons, is, thought, to, have, rights, or, group, rights, other, distinctions, between, rights, draw, more, on, historical, association, or, family, resemblance, than, on, precise, philosophical, distinctions, these, include, the, distinction, between, civil, and, political, rights, and, economic, social, and, cultural, rights, between, which, the, articles, of, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, are, often, divided, another, conception, of, rights, groups, them, into, three, generations, these, distinctions, have, much, overlap, with, that, between, negative, and, positive, rights, as, well, as, between, individual, rights, and, group, rights, but, these, groupings, are, not, entirely, coextensive, rights, are, often, included, in, the, foundational, questions, that, governments, and, politics, have, been, designed, to, deal, with, often, the, development, of, these, socio, political, institutions, have, formed, a, dialectical, relationship, with, rights, rights, about, particular, issues, or, the, rights, of, particular, groups, are, often, areas, of, special, concern, often, these, concerns, arise, when, rights, come, into, conflict, with, other, legal, or, moral, issues, sometimes, even, other, rights, issues, of, concern, have, historically, included, indigenous, rights, labor, rights, lgbt, rights, reproductive, rights, disability, rights, patient, rights, and, prisoners, rights, with, increasing, monitoring, and, the, information, society, information, rights, such, as, the, right, to, privacy, are, becoming, more, important, some, examples, of, groups, whose, rights, are, of, particular, concern, include, animals, and, amongst, humans, groups, such, as, children, and, youth, parents, both, mothers, and, fathers, and, men, and, women, accordingly, politics, plays, an, important, role, in, developing, or, recognizing, the, above, rights, and, the, discussion, about, which, behaviors, are, included, as, rights, is, an, ongoing, political, topic, of, importance, the, concept, of, rights, varies, with, political, orientation, positive, rights, such, as, a, right, to, medical, care, are, emphasized, more, often, by, left, leaning, thinkers, while, right, leaning, thinkers, place, more, emphasis, on, negative, rights, such, as, the, right, to, a, fair, trial, further, the, term, equality, which, is, often, bound, up, with, the, meaning, of, rights, often, depends, on, one, s, political, orientation, conservatives, and, right, wing, libertarians, and, advocates, of, free, markets, often, identify, equality, with, equality, of, opportunity, and, want, what, they, perceive, as, equal, and, fair, rules, in, the, process, of, making, things, while, agreeing, that, sometimes, these, fair, rules, lead, to, unequal, outcomes, in, contrast, socialists, see, the, power, imbalance, of, employer, employee, relationships, in, capitalism, as, a, cause, of, inequality, and, often, see, unequal, outcomes, as, a, hindrance, to, equality, of, opportunity, they, tend, to, identify, equality, of, outcome, as, a, sign, of, equality, and, therefore, think, that, people, have, a, right, to, portions, of, necessities, such, as, health, care, or, economic, assistance, or, housing, that, align, with, their, needs, in, philosophy, meta, ethics, is, the, branch, of, ethics, that, seeks, to, understand, the, nature, of, ethical, properties, statements, attitudes, and, judgments, meta, ethics, is, one, of, the, three, branches, of, ethics, generally, recognized, by, philosophers, the, others, being, normative, ethics, and, applied, ethics, while, normative, ethics, addresses, such, questions, as, what, should, one, do, thus, endorsing, some, ethical, evaluations, and, rejecting, others, meta, ethics, addresses, questions, such, as, what, is, goodness, and, how, can, we, tell, what, is, good, from, what, is, bad, seeking, to, understand, the, nature, of, ethical, properties, and, evaluations, rights, ethics, is, an, answer, to, the, meta, ethical, question, of, what, normative, ethics, is, concerned, with, meta, ethics, also, includes, a, group, of, questions, about, how, ethics, comes, to, be, known, true, etc, which, is, not, directly, addressed, by, rights, ethics, rights, ethics, holds, that, normative, ethics, is, concerned, with, rights, alternative, meta, ethical, theories, are, that, ethics, is, concerned, with, one, of, the, following, rights, ethics, has, had, considerable, influence, on, political, and, social, thinking, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, gives, some, concrete, examples, of, widely, accepted, rights, some, philosophers, have, criticised, some, rights, as, ontologically, dubious, entities, the, specific, enumeration, of, rights, has, differed, greatly, in, different, periods, of, history, in, many, cases, the, system, of, rights, promulgated, by, one, group, has, come, into, sharp, and, bitter, conflict, with, that, of, other, groups, in, the, political, sphere, a, place, in, which, rights, have, historically, been, an, important, issue, constitutional, provisions, of, various, states, sometimes, address, the, question, of, who, has, what, legal, rights, historically, many, notions, of, rights, were, authoritarian, and, hierarchical, with, different, people, granted, different, rights, and, some, having, more, rights, than, others, for, instance, the, right, of, a, father, to, be, respected, by, his, son, did, not, indicate, a, right, of, the, son, to, receive, something, in, return, for, that, respect, and, the, divine, right, of, kings, which, permitted, absolute, power, over, subjects, did, not, leave, much, possibility, for, many, rights, for, the, subjects, themselves, in, contrast, modern, conceptions, of, rights, have, often, emphasized, liberty, and, equality, as, among, the, most, important, aspects, of, rights, as, was, evident, in, the, american, and, french, revolutions, important, documents, in, the, political, history, of, rights, include, organisations
