possessed, significant, forces, of, bombers, and, fighters, world, war, i, also, saw, the, appearance, of, senior, commanders, who, directed, aerial, warfare, and, numerous, flying, aces, an, independent, air, force, is, one, which, is, a, separate, branch, of, a, nation, s, armed, forces, and, is, at, least, nominally, treated, as, a, military, service, on, par, with, that, of, older, services, like, navies, or, armies, the, british, royal, air, force, was, the, first, independent, air, force, in, the, world, the, raf, was, founded, on, 1, april, 1918, by, amalgamation, the,

officially, exist, during, the, finnish, civil, war, and, the, red, guards, had, its, own, air, force, over, the, following, decades, most, countries, with, substantial, military, capability, established, independent, air, forces, the, south, african, air, force, was, formed, on, 1, february, 1920, and, the, royal, australian, air, force, was, formed, shortly, thereafter, on, 31, march, 1921, although, it, was, not, until, 1922, that, the, head, of, the, service, was, titled, as, chief, of, the, air, staff, placing, him, on, a, par, with, his, australian, army, and, navy, counterparts, the, canadian, air, force, was, formed, at, the, end, of, world, war, i, and, was, abolished, and, reorganized, several, times, between, 1918, and, 1924, it, became, the, permanent, royal, canadian, air, force, when, it, received, the, royal, title, by, royal, proclamation, on, 1, april, 1924, it, did, not, however, become, independent, of, the, canadian, army, until, 1938, when, its, head, was, also, designated, as, chief, of, the, air, staff, similarly, the, royal, new, zealand, air, force, was, established, in, 1923, as, the, new, zealand, permanent, air, force, but, did, not, become, independent, of, the, new, zealand, army, until, 1937, the, royal, indian, air, force, was, also, formed, on, 8th, october, 1932, other, british, influenced, countries, also, established, independent, air, forces, for, example, the, royal, egyptian, air, force, was, created, in, 1937, when, egyptian, military, aviation, was, separated, from, army, command, the, afghan, air, force, was, established, on, 22, august, 1924, with, support, from, the, soviet, union, and, great, britain, but, a, civil, war, destroyed, most, of, the, planes, and, it, was, not, reestablished, until, 1937, when, king, mohammed, nadir, shah, took, power, outside, of, the, british, empire, the, italian, royal, air, force, was, founded, in, 1923, the, romanian, air, force, was, established, as, a, force, category, on, 1, january, 1924, the, finnish, air, force, was, established, as, a, separate, service, on, 4, may, 1928, the, chilean, air, force, was, founded, in, 1930, and, the, brazilian, air, force, was, created, in, 1941, both, the, united, states, air, force, and, the, philippine, air, force, were, formed, as, a, separate, branches, of, their, respective, armed, forces, in, 1947, as, did, the, argentine, air, force, in, 1945, the, israeli, air, force, came, into, being, with, the, state, of, israel, on, 18, may, 1948, but, evolved, from, the, pre, existing, sherut, avir, air, service, of, the, haganah, paramilitary, the, japan, air, self, defense, force, was, not, established, until, 1954, in, world, war, ii, japanese, military, aviation, had, been, carried, out, by, the, army, and, navy, unlike, all, these, countries, the, mexican, air, force, remains, an, integral, part, of, the, mexican, army, germany, was, the, first, country, to, organize, regular, air, attacks, on, enemy, infrastructure, with, the, luftstreitkr, fte, in, world, war, i, it, used, its, zeppelins, airships, to, drop, bombs, on, british, cities, at, that, time, britain, did, have, aircraft, though, her, airships, were, less, advanced, than, the, zeppelins, and, were, very, rarely, used, for, attacking, instead, they, were, usually, used, to, spy, on, german, u, boats, submarines, fixed, wing, aircraft, at, the, time, were, quite, primitive, being, able, to, achieve, velocities, comparable, to, that, of, modern, automobiles, and, mounting, minimal, weaponry, and, equipment, aerial, services, were, still, largely, a, new, venture, and, relatively, unreliable, machines, and, limited, training, resulted, in, stupendously, low, life, expectancies, for, early, military, aviators, by, the, time, world, war, ii, began, planes, had, become, much, safer, faster, and, more, reliable, they, were, adopted, as, standard, for, bombing, raids, and, taking, out, other, aircraft, because, they, were, much, faster, than, airships, the, world, s, largest, military, air, force, by, the, start, of, the, second, world, war, in, 1939, was, the, soviet, red, air, force, and, although, much, depleted, it, would, stage, the, largest, air, operations, of, wwii, over, the, four, years, of, combat, with, the, german, luftwaffe, arguably, the, war, s, most, important, air, operation, known, as, the, battle, of, britain, took, place, during, 1940, over, britain, and, the, english, channel, between, britain, s, royal, air, force, and, germany, s, luftwaffe, over, a, period, of, several, months, in, the, end, britain, emerged, victorious, and, this, caused, adolf, hitler, to, give, up, his, plan, to, invade, britain, other, prominent, air, force, operations, during, the, second, world, war, include, the, allied, bombing, of, germany, during, 1942, 1944, and, the, red, air, force, operations, in, support, of, strategic, ground, offensives, on, the, eastern, front, the, aerial, warfare, in, pacific, ocean, theatre, was, of, a, comparable, strategic, significance, to, the, battle, of, britain, but, was, largely, conducted, by, the, us, and, japanese, naval, aviation, services, and, not, by, air, forces, the, air, force, s, role, of, strategic, bombing, against, enemy, infrastructure, was, developed, during, the, 1930s, by, the, japanese, in, china, and, by, the, germans, during, the, spanish, civil, war, this, role, for, the, bomber, was, perfected, during, world, war, ii, during, allied, thousand, bomber, raid, operations, the, need, to, intercept, these, bombers, both, during, the, day, and, at, night, accelerated, fighter, aircraft, developments, the, war, ended, when, united, states, army, air, forces, boeing, b, 29, superfortress, bombers, dropped, atomic, bombs, on, hiroshima, and, nagasaki, in, japan, in, august, 1945, the, united, states, air, force, became, an, independent, service, in, 1947, as, the, cold, war, began, both, the, usaf, and, the, soviet, air, force, built, up, their, nuclear, capable, strategic, bomber, forces, several, technological, advances, were, widely, introduced, during, this, time, the, jet, engine, the, missile, the, helicopter, and, inflight, refueling, in, 1954, the, japan, air, self, defense, force, was, founded, as, a, separate, service, previously, japan, had, delivered, its, service, aviation, from, within, its, army, and, navy, during, the, 1960s, canada, merged, the, royal, canadian, air, force, with, the, army, and, the, navy, to, form, the, unified, canadian, forces, with, air, assets, divided, between, several, commands, and, a, green, uniform, for, everyone, this, proved, very, unpopular, and, in, 1975, canadian, aviation, units, were, reorganized, under, a, single, organization, air, command, with, a, single, commander, in, 2011, the, canadian, forces, air, command, reverted, to, its, pre, 1960s, name, the, royal, canadian, air, force, the, organizational, structures, of, air, forces, vary, between, nations, some, air, forces, such, as, the, united, states, air, force, the, royal, air, force, are, divided, into, commands, groups, and, squadrons, others, such, as, the, soviet, air, force, have, an, army, style, organizational, structure, the, modern, royal, canadian, air, force, uses, air, division, as, the, formation, between, wings, and, the, entire, air, command, like, the, raf, canadian, wings, consist, of, squadrons, in, the, case, of, china, the, air, force, headquarters, consists, of, four, departments, command, political, logistic, and, equipment, which, mirrors, the, four, general, departments, of, the, people, s, liberation, army, below, the, headquarters, military, region, air, forces, mraf, direct, divisions, fighter, attack, bomber, which, in, turn, direct, regiments, and, squadrons, air, assault, and, airborne, infantry, such, as, the, royal, air, force, regiment, royal, australian, air, force, airfield, defense, guards, rnzaf, security, forces, and, the, us, air, force, security, forces, are, used, primarily, for, ground, based, defence, of, air, bases, and, other, air, force, facilities, they, also, have, a, number, of, other,
