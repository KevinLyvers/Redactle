the, energy, industry, is, the, totality, of, all, of, the, industries, involved, in, the, production, and, sale, of, energy, including, fuel, extraction, manufacturing, refining, and, distribution, modern, society, consumes, large, amounts, of, fuel, and, the, energy, industry, is, a, crucial, part, of, the, infrastructure, and, maintenance, of, society, in, almost, all, countries, in, particular, the, energy, industry, comprises, the, increased, dependence, during, the, 20th, century, on, carbon, emitting, energy, sources, such, as, fossil, fuels, and, carbon, emitting, renewables, such, as, biomass, means, that, the, energy, industry, has, frequently, contributed, to, pollution, and, environmental, impacts, on, the, economy, until, recently, fossil, fuels, were, the, primary, source, of, energy, generation, in, most, parts, of, the, world, and, are, a, significant, contributor, to, global, warming, and, pollution, many, economies, are, investing, in, renewable, and, sustainable, energy, as, part, of, human, adaptation, to, global, warming, the, use, of, energy, has, been, a, key, in, the, development, of, the, human, society, by, helping, it, to, control, and, adapt, to, the, environment, managing, the, use, of, energy, is, inevitable, in, any, functional, society, in, the, industrialized, world, the, development, of, energy, resources, has, become, essential, for, agriculture, transportation, waste, collection, information, technology, communications, that, have, become, prerequisites, of, a, developed, society, the, increasing, use, of, energy, since, the, industrial, revolution, has, also, brought, with, it, a, number, of, serious, problems, some, of, which, such, as, global, warming, present, potentially, grave, risks, to, the, world, in, some, industries, the, word, energy, is, used, as, a, synonym, for, energy, resources, which, refer, to, substances, like, fuels, petroleum, products, and, electricity, in, general, this, is, because, a, significant, portion, of, the, energy, contained, in, these, resources, can, easily, be, extracted, to, serve, a, useful, purpose, after, a, useful, process, has, taken, place, the, total, energy, is, conserved, still, the, resource, itself, is, not, conserved, since, a, process, usually, transforms, the, energy, into, unusable, forms, such, as, unnecessary, or, excess, heat, ever, since, humanity, discovered, various, energy, resources, available, in, nature, it, has, been, inventing, devices, known, as, machines, that, make, life, more, comfortable, by, using, energy, resources, thus, although, primitive, man, knew, the, utility, of, fire, to, cook, food, the, invention, of, devices, like, gas, burners, and, microwave, ovens, has, increased, energy, usage, for, this, purpose, alone, the, trend, is, the, same, in, any, other, field, of, social, activity, be, it, the, construction, of, social, infrastructure, manufacturing, of, fabrics, for, covering, porting, printing, decorating, for, example, textiles, air, conditioning, communication, of, information, or, for, moving, people, and, goods, automobiles, production, and, consumption, of, energy, resources, is, very, important, to, the, global, economy, all, economic, activity, requires, energy, resources, whether, to, manufacture, goods, provide, transportation, run, computers, and, other, machines, widespread, demand, for, energy, may, encourage, competing, energy, utilities, and, the, formation, of, retail, energy, markets, note, the, presence, of, the, energy, marketing, and, customer, service, emacs, sub, sector, the, energy, sector, accounts, for, 4, 6, of, outstanding, leveraged, loans, compared, with, 3, 1, a, decade, ago, while, energy, bonds, make, up, 15, 7, of, the, 1, 3, trillion, junk, bond, market, up, from, 4, 3, over, the, same, period, since, the, cost, of, energy, has, become, a, significant, factor, in, the, performance, of, societies, economies, the, management, of, energy, resources, has, become, crucial, energy, management, involves, utilizing, the, available, energy, resources, more, effectively, that, is, with, minimum, incremental, costs, simple, management, techniques, can, often, save, energy, expenditures, without, incorporating, fresh, technology, energy, management, is, most, often, the, practice, of, using, energy, more, efficiently, by, eliminating, energy, wastage, or, balancing, justifiable, energy, demand, with, appropriate, energy, supply, the, process, couples, energy, awareness, with, energy, conservation, the, united, nations, developed, the, international, standard, industrial, classification, which, is, a, list, of, economic, and, social, classifications, there, is, no, distinct, classification, for, an, energy, industry, because, the, classification, system, is, based, on, activities, products, and, expenditures, according, to, purpose, countries, in, north, america, use, the, north, american, industry, classification, system, naics, the, naics, sectors, 21, and, 22, mining, and, utilities, might, roughly, define, the, energy, industry, in, north, america, this, classification, is, used, by, the, u, s, securities, and, exchange, commission, the, global, industry, classification, standard, used, by, morgan, stanley, define, the, energy, industry, as, comprising, companies, primarily, working, with, oil, gas, coal, and, consumable, fuels, excluding, companies, working, with, certain, industrial, gases, add, also, to, expand, this, section, dow, jones, industrial, average, government, encouragement, in, the, form, of, subsidies, and, tax, incentives, for, energy, conservation, efforts, has, increasingly, fostered, the, view, of, conservation, as, a, major, function, of, the, energy, industry, saving, an, amount, of, energy, provides, economic, benefits, almost, identical, to, generating, that, same, amount, of, energy, this, is, compounded, by, the, fact, that, the, economics, of, delivering, energy, tend, to, be, priced, for, capacity, as, opposed, to, average, usage, one, of, the, purposes, of, a, smart, grid, infrastructure, is, to, smooth, out, demand, so, that, capacity, and, demand, curves, align, more, closely, some, parts, of, the, energy, industry, generate, considerable, pollution, including, toxic, and, greenhouse, gases, from, fuel, combustion, nuclear, waste, from, the, generation, of, nuclear, power, and, oil, spillages, as, a, result, of, petroleum, extraction, government, regulations, to, internalize, these, externalities, form, an, increasing, part, of, doing, business, and, the, trading, of, carbon, credits, and, pollution, credits, on, the, free, market, may, also, result, in, energy, saving, and, pollution, control, measures, becoming, even, more, important, to, energy, providers, consumption, of, energy, resources, e, g, turning, on, a, light, requires, resources, and, has, an, effect, on, the, environment, many, electric, power, plants, burn, coal, oil, or, natural, gas, in, order, to, generate, electricity, for, energy, needs, while, burning, these, fossil, fuels, produces, a, readily, available, and, instantaneous, supply, of, electricity, it, also, generates, air, pollutants, including, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, sulfur, dioxide, and, trioxide, sox, and, nitrogen, oxides, nox, carbon, dioxide, is, an, important, greenhouse, gas, known, to, be, responsible, along, with, methane, nitrous, oxide, and, fluorinated, gases, for, the, rapid, increase, in, global, warming, since, the, industrial, revolution, in, the, 20th, century, global, temperature, records, are, significantly, higher, than, temperature, records, from, thousands, of, years, ago, taken, from, ice, cores, in, arctic, regions, burning, fossil, fuels, for, electricity, generation, also, releases, trace, metals, such, as, beryllium, cadmium, chromium, copper, manganese, mercury, nickel, and, silver, into, the, environment, which, also, act, as, pollutants, the, large, scale, use, of, renewable, energy, technologies, would, greatly, mitigate, or, eliminate, a, wide, range, of, environmental, and, human, health, impacts, of, energy, use, renewable, energy, technologies, include, biofuels, solar, heating, and, cooling, hydroelectric, power, solar, power, and, wind, power, energy, conservation, and, the, efficient, use, of, energy, would, also, help, in, addition, it, is, argued, that, there, is, also, the, potential, to, develop, a, more, efficient, energy, sector, this, can, be, done, by, best, available, technology, bat, offers, supply, side, efficiency, levels, far, higher, than, global, averages, the, relative, benefits, of, gas, compared, to, coal, are, influenced, by, the, development, of, increasingly, efficient, energy, production, methods, according, to, an, impact, assessment, carried, out, for, the, european, commission, the, levels, of, energy, efficiency, of, coal, fired, plants, built, have, now, increased, to, 46, 49, efficiency, rates, as, compared, to, coals, plants, built, before, the, 1990s, 32, 40, however, at, the, same, time, gas, can, reach, 58, 59, efficiency, levels, with, the, best, available, technology, meanwhile, combined, heat, and, power, can, offer, efficiency, rates, of, 80, 90, since, now, energy, plays, an, essential, role, in, industrial, societies, the, ownership, and, control, of, energy, resources, plays, an, increasing, role, in, politics, at, the, national, level, governments, seek, to, influence, the, sharing, distribution, of, energy, resources, among, various, sections, of, the, society, through, pricing, mechanisms, or, even, who, owns, resources, within, their, borders, they, may, also, seek, to, influence, the, use, of, energy, by, individuals, and, business, in, an, attempt, to, tackle, environmental, issues, the, most, recent, international, political, controversy, regarding, energy, resources, is, in, the, context, of, the, iraq, wars, some, political, analysts, maintain, that, the, hidden, reason, for, both, 1991, and, 2003, wars, can, be, traced, to, strategic, control, of, international, energy, resources, others, counter, this, analysis, with, the, numbers, related, to, its, economics, according, to, the, latter, group, of, analysts, u, s, has, spent, about, 336, billion, in, iraq, as, compared, with, a, background, current, value, of, 25, billion, per, year, budget, for, the, entire, u, s, oil, import, dependence, energy, policy, is, the, manner, in, which, a, given, entity, often, governmental, has, decided, to, address, issues, of, energy, development, including, energy, production, distribution, and, consumption, the, attributes, of, energy, policy, may, include, legislation, international, treaties, incentives, to, investment, guidelines, for, energy, conservation, taxation, and, other, public, policy, techniques, energy, security, is, the, intersection, of, national, security, and, the, availability, of, natural, resources, for, energy, consumption, access, to, cheap, energy, has, become, essential, to, the, functioning, of, modern, economies, however, the, uneven, distribution, of, energy, supplies, among, countries, has, led, to, significant, vulnerabilities, threats, to, energy, security, include, the, political, instability, of, several, energy, producing, countries, the, manipulation, of, energy, supplies, the, competition, over, energy, sources, attacks, on, supply, infrastructure, as, well, as, accidents, natural, disasters, the, funding, to, foreign, dictators, rising, terrorism, and, dominant, countries, reliance, to, the, foreign, oil, supply, the, limited, supplies, uneven, distribution, and, rising, costs, of, fossil, fuels, such, as, oil, and, gas, create, a, need, to, change, to, more, sustainable, energy, sources, in, the, foreseeable, future, with, as, much, dependence, that, the, u, s, currently, has, for, oil, and, with, the, peaking, limits, of, oil, production, economies, and, societies, will, begin, to, feel, the, decline, in, the, resource, that, we, have, become, dependent, upon, energy, security, has, become, one, of, the, leading, issues, in, the, world, today, as, oil, and, other, resources, have, become, as, vital, to, the, world, s, people, however, with, oil, production, rates, decreasing, and, oil, production, peak, nearing, the, world, has, come, to, protect, what, resources, we, have, left, with, new, advancements, in, renewable, resources, less, pressure, has, been, put, on, companies, that, produce, the, world, s, oil, these, resources, are, geothermal, solar, power, wind, power, and, hydroelectric, although, these, are, not, all, the, current, and, possible, options, for, the, world, to, turn, to, as, the, oil, depletes, the, most, critical, issue, is, protecting, these, vital, resources, from, future, threats, these, new, resources, will, become, more, valuable, as, the, price, of, exporting, and, importing, oil, will, increase, due, to, increased, demand, producing, energy, to, sustain, human, needs, is, an, essential, social, activity, and, a, great, deal, of, effort, goes, into, the, activity, while, most, of, such, effort, is, limited, towards, increasing, the, production, of, electricity, and, oil, newer, ways, of, producing, usable, energy, resources, from, the, available, energy, resources, are, being, explored, one, such, effort, is, to, explore, means, of, producing, hydrogen, fuel, from, water, though, hydrogen, use, is, environmentally, friendly, its, production, requires, energy, and, existing, technologies, to, make, it, are, not, very, efficient, research, is, underway, to, explore, enzymatic, decomposition, of, biomass, other, forms, of, conventional, energy, resources, are, also, being, used, in, new, ways, coal, gasification, and, liquefaction, are, recent, technologies, that, are, becoming, attractive, after, the, realization, that, oil, reserves, at, present, consumption, rates, may, be, rather, short, lived, see, alternative, fuels, energy, is, the, subject, of, significant, research, activities, globally, for, example, the, uk, energy, research, centre, is, the, focal, point, for, uk, energy, research, while, the, european, union, has, many, technology, programmes, as, well, as, a, platform, for, engaging, social, science, and, humanities, within, energy, research, all, societies, require, materials, and, food, to, be, transported, over, distances, generally, against, some, force, of, friction, since, application, of, force, over, distance, requires, the, presence, of, a, source, of, usable, energy, such, sources, are, of, great, worth, in, society, while, energy, resources, are, an, essential, ingredient, for, all, modes, of, transportation, in, society, the, transportation, of, energy, resources, is, becoming, equally, important, energy, resources, are, frequently, located, far, from, the, place, where, they, are, consumed, therefore, their, transportation, is, always, in, question, some, energy, resources, like, liquid, or, gaseous, fuels, are, transported, using, tankers, or, pipelines, while, electricity, transportation, invariably, requires, a, network, of, grid, cables, the, transportation, of, energy, whether, by, tanker, pipeline, or, transmission, line, poses, challenges, for, scientists, and, engineers, policy, makers, and, economists, to, make, it, more, risk, free, and, efficient, economic, and, political, instability, can, lead, to, an, energy, crisis, notable, oil, crises, are, the, 1973, oil, crisis, and, the, 1979, oil, crisis, the, advent, of, peak, oil, the, point, in, time, when, the, maximum, rate, of, global, petroleum, extraction, is, reached, will, likely, precipitate, another, energy, crisis, between, 1985, and, 2018, there, have, been, around, 69, 932, deals, in, the, energy, sector, this, cumulates, to, an, overall, value, of, 9, 578, bil, usd, the, most, active, year, was, 2010, with, about, 3, 761, deals, in, terms, of, value, 2007, was, the, strongest, year, 684, bil, usd, which, was, followed, by, a, steep, decline, until, 2009, 55, 8, here, is, a, list, of, the, top, 10, deals, in, history, in, the, energy, sector
