a, dream, is, a, succession, of, images, ideas, emotions, and, sensations, that, usually, occur, involuntarily, in, the, mind, during, certain, stages, of, sleep, humans, spend, about, two, hours, dreaming, per, night, and, each, dream, lasts, around, 5, 20, minutes, although, the, dreamer, may, perceive, the, dream, as, being, much, longer, than, this, the, content, and, function, of, dreams, have, been, topics, of, scientific, philosophical, and, religious, interest, throughout, recorded, history, dream, interpretation, practiced, by, the, babylonians, in, the, third, millennium, bce, and, even, earlier, by, the, ancient, sumerians, figures, prominently, in, religious, texts, in, several, traditions, and, has, played, a, lead, role, in, psychotherapy, the, scientific, study, of, dreams, is, called, oneirology, most, modern, dream, study, focuses, on, the, neurophysiology, of, dreams, and, on, proposing, and, testing, hypotheses, regarding, dream, function, it, is, not, known, where, in, the, brain, dreams, originate, if, there, is, a, single, origin, for, dreams, or, if, multiple, regions, of, the, brain, are, involved, or, what, the, purpose, of, dreaming, is, for, the, body, or, mind, the, human, dream, experience, and, what, to, make, of, it, has, undergone, sizable, shifts, over, the, course, of, history, long, ago, according, to, writings, from, mesopotamia, and, ancient, egypt, dreams, dictated, post, dream, behaviors, to, an, extent, that, was, sharply, reduced, in, later, millennia, these, ancient, writings, about, dreams, highlight, visitation, dreams, where, a, dream, figure, usually, a, deity, or, a, prominent, forebear, commands, the, dreamer, to, take, specific, actions, and, which, may, predict, future, events, framing, the, dream, experience, varies, across, cultures, as, well, as, through, time, dreaming, and, sleep, are, intertwined, dreams, occur, mainly, in, the, rapid, eye, movement, rem, stage, of, sleep, when, brain, activity, is, high, and, resembles, that, of, being, awake, because, rem, sleep, is, detectable, in, many, species, and, because, research, suggests, that, all, mammals, experience, rem, linking, dreams, to, rem, sleep, has, led, to, conjectures, that, animals, dream, however, humans, dream, during, non, rem, sleep, also, and, not, all, rem, awakenings, elicit, dream, reports, to, be, studied, a, dream, must, first, be, reduced, to, a, verbal, report, which, is, an, account, of, the, subject, s, memory, of, the, dream, not, the, subject, s, dream, experience, itself, so, dreaming, by, non, humans, is, currently, unprovable, as, is, dreaming, by, human, fetuses, and, pre, verbal, infants, preserved, writings, from, early, mediterranean, civilizations, indicate, a, relatively, abrupt, change, in, subjective, dream, experience, between, bronze, age, antiquity, and, the, beginnings, of, the, classical, era, in, visitation, dreams, reported, in, ancient, writings, dreamers, were, largely, passive, in, their, dreams, and, visual, content, served, primarily, to, frame, authoritative, auditory, messaging, gudea, the, king, of, the, sumerian, city, state, of, lagash, reigned, c, 2144, 2124, bce, rebuilt, the, temple, of, ningirsu, as, the, result, of, a, dream, in, which, he, was, told, to, do, so, after, antiquity, the, passive, hearing, of, visitation, dreams, largely, gave, way, to, visualized, narratives, in, which, the, dreamer, becomes, a, character, who, actively, participates, from, the, 1940s, to, 1985, calvin, s, hall, collected, more, than, 50, 000, dream, reports, at, western, reserve, university, in, 1966, hall, and, robert, van, de, castle, published, the, content, analysis, of, dreams, in, which, they, outlined, a, coding, system, to, study, 1, 000, dream, reports, from, college, students, results, indicated, that, participants, from, varying, parts, of, the, world, demonstrated, similarity, in, their, dream, content, the, only, residue, of, antiquity, s, authoritative, dream, figure, in, the, hall, and, van, de, castle, listing, of, dream, characters, is, the, inclusion, of, god, in, the, category, of, prominent, persons, hall, s, complete, dream, reports, were, made, publicly, available, in, the, mid, 1990s, by, his, prot, g, william, domhoff, more, recent, studies, of, dream, reports, while, providing, more, detail, continue, to, cite, the, hall, study, favorably, in, the, hall, study, the, most, common, emotion, experienced, in, dreams, was, anxiety, other, emotions, included, abandonment, anger, fear, joy, and, happiness, negative, emotions, were, much, more, common, than, positive, ones, the, hall, data, analysis, showed, that, sexual, dreams, occur, no, more, than, 10, of, the, time, and, are, more, prevalent, in, young, to, mid, teens, another, study, showed, that, 8, of, both, men, s, and, women, s, dreams, have, sexual, content, in, some, cases, sexual, dreams, may, result, in, orgasms, or, nocturnal, emissions, these, are, colloquially, known, as, wet, dreams, the, visual, nature, of, dreams, is, generally, highly, phantasmagoric, that, is, different, locations, and, objects, continuously, blend, into, each, other, the, visuals, including, locations, people, and, objects, are, generally, reflective, of, a, person, s, memories, and, experiences, but, conversation, can, take, on, highly, exaggerated, and, bizarre, forms, some, dreams, may, even, tell, elaborate, stories, wherein, the, dreamer, enters, entirely, new, complex, worlds, and, awakes, with, ideas, thoughts, and, feelings, never, experienced, prior, to, the, dream, people, who, are, blind, from, birth, do, not, have, visual, dreams, their, dream, contents, are, related, to, other, senses, such, as, hearing, touch, smell, and, taste, whichever, are, present, since, birth, dream, study, is, popular, with, scientists, exploring, the, mind, brain, problem, some, propose, to, reduce, aspects, of, dream, phenomenology, to, neurobiology, but, current, science, cannot, specify, dream, physiology, in, detail, protocols, in, most, nations, restrict, human, brain, research, to, non, invasive, procedures, in, the, united, states, invasive, brain, procedures, with, a, human, subject, are, allowed, only, when, these, are, deemed, necessary, in, surgical, treatment, to, address, medical, needs, of, the, same, human, subject, non, invasive, measures, of, brain, activity, like, electroencephalogram, eeg, voltage, averaging, or, cerebral, blood, flow, cannot, identify, small, but, influential, neuronal, populations, also, fmri, signals, are, too, slow, to, explain, how, brains, compute, in, real, time, scientists, researching, some, brain, functions, can, work, around, current, restrictions, by, examining, animal, subjects, as, stated, by, the, society, for, neuroscience, because, no, adequate, alternatives, exist, much, of, this, research, must, be, done, on, animal, subjects, however, since, animal, dreaming, can, be, only, inferred, not, confirmed, animal, studies, yield, no, hard, facts, to, illuminate, the, neurophysiology, of, dreams, examining, human, subjects, with, brain, lesions, can, provide, clues, but, the, lesion, method, cannot, discriminate, between, the, effects, of, destruction, and, disconnection, and, cannot, target, specific, neuronal, groups, in, heterogeneous, regions, like, the, brain, stem, denied, precision, tools, and, obliged, to, depend, on, imaging, much, dream, research, has, succumbed, to, the, law, of, the, instrument, studies, detect, an, increase, of, blood, flow, in, a, specific, brain, region, and, then, credit, that, region, with, a, role, in, generating, dreams, but, pooling, study, results, has, led, to, the, newer, conclusion, that, dreaming, involves, large, numbers, of, regions, and, pathways, which, likely, are, different, for, different, dream, events, image, creation, in, the, brain, involves, significant, neural, activity, downstream, from, eye, intake, and, it, is, theorized, that, the, visual, imagery, of, dreams, is, produced, by, activation, during, sleep, of, the, same, structures, that, generate, complex, visual, imagery, in, waking, perception, dreams, present, a, running, narrative, rather, than, exclusively, visual, imagery, following, their, work, with, split, brain, subjects, gazzaniga, and, ledoux, postulated, without, attempting, to, specify, the, neural, mechanisms, a, left, brain, interpreter, that, seeks, to, create, a, plausible, narrative, from, whatever, electro, chemical, signals, reach, the, brain, s, left, hemisphere, sleep, research, has, determined, that, some, brain, regions, fully, active, during, waking, are, during, rem, sleep, activated, only, in, a, partial, or, fragmentary, way, drawing, on, this, knowledge, textbook, author, james, w, kalat, explains, dream, represents, the, brain, s, effort, to, make, sense, of, sparse, and, distorted, information, the, cortex, combines, this, haphazard, input, with, whatever, other, activity, was, already, occurring, and, does, its, best, to, synthesize, a, story, that, makes, sense, of, the, information, neuroscientist, indre, viskontas, is, even, more, blunt, calling, often, bizarre, dream, content, just, the, result, of, your, interpreter, trying, to, create, a, story, out, of, random, neural, signaling, for, many, humans, across, multiple, eras, and, cultures, dreams, are, believed, to, have, functioned, as, revealers, of, truths, sourced, during, sleep, from, gods, or, other, external, entities, ancient, egyptians, believed, that, dreams, were, the, best, way, to, receive, divine, revelation, and, thus, they, would, induce, or, incubate, dreams, they, went, to, sanctuaries, and, slept, on, special, dream, beds, in, hope, of, receiving, advice, comfort, or, healing, from, the, gods, from, a, darwinian, perspective, dreams, would, have, to, fulfill, some, kind, of, biological, requirement, provide, some, benefit, for, natural, selection, to, take, place, or, at, least, have, no, negative, impact, on, fitness, robert, 1886, a, physician, from, hamburg, was, the, first, who, suggested, that, dreams, are, a, need, and, that, they, have, the, function, to, erase, a, sensory, impressions, that, were, not, fully, worked, up, and, b, ideas, that, were, not, fully, developed, during, the, day, in, dreams, incomplete, material, is, either, removed, suppressed, or, deepened, and, included, into, memory, freud, whose, dream, studies, focused, on, interpreting, dreams, not, explaining, how, or, why, humans, dream, disputed, robert, s, hypothesis, and, proposed, that, dreams, preserve, sleep, by, representing, as, fulfilled, those, wishes, that, otherwise, would, awaken, the, dreamer, freud, wrote, that, dreams, serve, the, purpose, of, prolonging, sleep, instead, of, waking, up, dreams, are, the, guardians, of, sleep, and, not, its, disturbers, a, turning, point, in, theorizing, about, dream, function, came, in, 1953, when, science, published, the, aserinsky, and, kleitman, paper, establishing, rem, sleep, as, a, distinct, phase, of, sleep, and, linking, dreams, to, rem, sleep, until, and, even, after, publication, of, the, solms, 2000, paper, that, certified, the, separability, of, rem, sleep, and, dream, phenomena, many, studies, purporting, to, uncover, the, function, of, dreams, have, in, fact, been, studying, not, dreams, but, measurable, rem, sleep, theories, of, dream, function, since, the, identification, of, rem, sleep, include, hobson, s, and, mccarley, s, 1977, activation, synthesis, hypothesis, which, proposed, a, functional, role, for, dreaming, sleep, in, promoting, some, aspect, of, the, learning, process, in, 2010, a, harvard, study, was, published, showing, experimental, evidence, that, dreams, were, correlated, with, improved, learning, crick, s, and, mitchison, s, 1983, reverse, learning, theory, which, states, that, dreams, are, like, the, cleaning, up, operations, of, computers, when, they, are, offline, removing, suppressing, parasitic, nodes, and, other, junk, from, the, mind, during, sleep, hartmann, s, 1995, proposal, that, dreams, serve, a, quasi, therapeutic, function, enabling, the, dreamer, to, process, trauma, in, a, safe, place, revonsuo, s, 2000, threat, simulation, hypothesis, whose, premise, is, that, during, much, of, human, evolution, physical, and, interpersonal, threats, were, serious, giving, reproductive, advantage, to, those, who, survived, them, dreaming, aided, survival, by, replicating, these, threats, and, providing, the, dreamer, with, practice, in, dealing, with, them, in, 2015, revonsuo, proposed, social, simulation, theory, which, describes, dreams, as, a, simulation, for, training, social, skills, and, bonds, eagleman, s, and, vaughn, s, 2021, defensive, activation, theory, which, says, that, given, the, brain, s, neuroplasticity, dreams, evolved, as, a, visual, hallucinatory, activity, during, sleep, s, extended, periods, of, darkness, busying, the, occipital, lobe, and, thereby, protecting, it, from, possible, appropriation, by, other, non, vision, sense, operations, erik, hoel, proposes, based, on, artificial, neural, networks, that, dreams, prevent, overfitting, to, past, experiences, that, is, they, enable, the, dreamer, to, learn, from, novel, situations, dreams, figure, prominently, in, major, world, religions, the, dream, experience, for, early, humans, according, to, one, interpretation, gave, rise, to, the, notion, of, a, human, soul, a, central, element, in, much, religious, thought, j, w, dunne, wrote, but, there, can, be, no, reasonable, doubt, that, the, idea, of, a, soul, must, have, first, arisen, in, the, mind, of, primitive, man, as, a, result, of, observation, of, his, dreams, ignorant, as, he, was, he, could, have, come, to, no, other, conclusion, but, that, in, dreams, he, left, his, sleeping, body, in, one, universe, and, went, wandering, off, into, another, it, is, considered, that, but, for, that, savage, the, idea, of, such, a, thing, as, a, soul, would, never, have, even, occurred, to, mankind, in, the, mandukya, upanishad, part, of, the, veda, scriptures, of, indian, hinduism, a, dream, is, one, of, three, states, that, the, soul, experiences, during, its, lifetime, the, other, two, states, being, the, waking, state, and, the, sleep, state, the, earliest, upanishads, written, before, 300, bce, emphasize, two, meanings, of, dreams, the, first, says, that, dreams, are, merely, expressions, of, inner, desires, the, second, is, the, belief, of, the, soul, leaving, the, body, and, being, guided, until, awakened, in, judaism, dreams, are, considered, part, of, the, experience, of, the, world, that, can, be, interpreted, and, from, which, lessons, can, be, garnered, it, is, discussed, in, the, talmud, tractate, berachot, 55, 60, the, ancient, hebrews, connected, their, dreams, heavily, with, their, religion, though, the, hebrews, were, monotheistic, and, believed, that, dreams, were, the, voice, of, one, god, alone, hebrews, also, differentiated, between, good, dreams, from, god, and, bad, dreams, from, evil, spirits, the, hebrews, like, many, other, ancient, cultures, incubated, dreams, in, order, to, receive, a, divine, revelation, for, example, the, hebrew, prophet, samuel, would, lie, down, and, sleep, in, the, temple, at, shiloh, before, the, ark, and, receive, the, word, of, the, lord, and, joseph, interpreted, a, pharaoh, s, dream, of, seven, lean, cows, swallowing, seven, fat, cows, as, meaning, the, subsequent, seven, years, would, be, bountiful, followed, by, seven, years, of, famine, most, of, the, dreams, in, the, bible, are, in, the, book, of, genesis, christians, mostly, shared, the, beliefs, of, the, hebrews, and, thought, that, dreams, were, of, a, supernatural, character, because, the, old, testament, includes, frequent, stories, of, dreams, with, divine, inspiration, the, most, famous, of, these, dream, stories, was, jacob, s, dream, of, a, ladder, that, stretches, from, earth, to, heaven, many, christians, preach, that, god, can, speak, to, people, through, their, dreams, the, famous, glossary, the, somniale, danielis, written, in, the, name, of, daniel, attempted, to, teach, christian, populations, to, interpret, their, dreams, iain, r, edgar, has, researched, the, role, of, dreams, in, islam, he, has, argued, that, dreams, play, an, important, role, in, the, history, of, islam, and, the, lives, of, muslims, since, dream, interpretation, is, the, only, way, that, muslims, can, receive, revelations, from, god, since, the, death, of, the, last, prophet, muhammad, according, to, edgar, islam, classifies, three, types, of, dreams, firstly, there, is, the, true, dream, al, ru, ya, then, the, false, dream, which, may, come, from, the, devil, shaytan, and, finally, the, meaningless, everyday, dream, hulm, this, last, dream, could, be, brought, forth, by, the, dreamer, s, ego, or, base, appetite, based, on, what, they, experienced, in, the, real, world, the, true, dream, is, often, indicated, by, islam, s, hadith, tradition, in, one, narration, by, aisha, the, wife, of, the, prophet, it, is, said, that, the, prophet, s, dreams, would, come, true, like, the, ocean, s, waves, just, as, in, its, predecessors, the, quran, also, recounts, the, story, of, joseph, and, his, unique, ability, to, interpret, dreams, in, both, christianity, and, islam, dreams, feature, in, conversion, stories, according, to, ancient, authors, constantine, the, great, started, his, conversion, to, christianity, because, he, had, a, dream, which, prophesied, that, he, would, win, the, battle, of, the, milvian, bridge, if, he, adopted, the, chi, rho, as, his, battle, standard, in, buddhism, ideas, about, dreams, are, similar, to, the, classical, and, folk, traditions, in, south, asia, the, same, dream, is, sometimes, experienced, by, multiple, people, as, in, the, case, of, the, buddha, to, be, before, he, is, leaving, his, home, it, is, described, in, the, mah, vastu, that, several, of, the, buddha, s, relatives, had, premonitory, dreams, preceding, this, some, dreams, are, also, seen, to, transcend, time, the, buddha, to, be, has, certain, dreams, that, are, the, same, as, those, of, previous, buddhas, the, lalitavistara, states, in, buddhist, literature, dreams, often, function, as, a, signpost, motif, to, mark, certain, stages, in, the, life, of, the, main, character, buddhist, views, about, dreams, are, expressed, in, the, p, li, commentaries, and, the, milinda, pa, h, in, chinese, history, people, wrote, of, two, vital, aspects, of, the, soul, of, which, one, is, freed, from, the, body, during, slumber, to, journey, in, a, dream, realm, while, the, other, remained, in, the, body, this, belief, and, dream, interpretation, had, been, questioned, since, early, times, such, as, by, the, philosopher, wang, chong, 27, 97, ce, the, babylonians, and, assyrians, divided, dreams, into, good, which, were, sent, by, the, gods, and, bad, sent, by, demons, a, surviving, collection, of, dream, omens, entitled, i, kar, zaq, qu, records, various, dream, scenarios, as, well, as, prognostications, of, what, will, happen, to, the, person, who, experiences, each, dream, apparently, based, on, previous, cases, some, list, different, possible, outcomes, based, on, occasions, in, which, people, experienced, similar, dreams, with, different, results, the, greeks, shared, their, beliefs, with, the, egyptians, on, how, to, interpret, good, and, bad, dreams, and, the, idea, of, incubating, dreams, morpheus, the, greek, god, of, dreams, also, sent, warnings, and, prophecies, to, those, who, slept, at, shrines, and, temples, the, earliest, greek, beliefs, about, dreams, were, that, their, gods, physically, visited, the, dreamers, where, they, entered, through, a, keyhole, exiting, the, same, way, after, the, divine, message, was, given, antiphon, wrote, the, first, known, greek, book, on, dreams, in, the, 5th, century, bce, in, that, century, other, cultures, influenced, greeks, to, develop, the, belief, that, souls, left, the, sleeping, body, the, father, of, modern, medicine, hippocrates, 460, 375, bce, thought, dreams, could, analyze, illness, and, predict, diseases, for, instance, a, dream, of, a, dim, star, high, in, the, night, sky, indicated, problems, in, the, head, region, while, low, in, the, night, sky, indicated, bowel, issues, greek, philosopher, plato, 427, 347, wrote, that, people, harbor, secret, repressed, desires, such, as, incest, murder, adultery, and, conquest, which, build, up, during, the, day, and, run, rampant, during, the, night, in, dreams, plato, s, student, aristotle, 384, 322, bce, believed, dreams, were, caused, by, processing, incomplete, physiological, activity, during, sleep, such, as, eyes, trying, to, see, while, the, sleeper, s, eyelids, were, closed, marcus, tullius, cicero, for, his, part, believed, that, all, dreams, are, produced, by, thoughts, and, conversations, a, dreamer, had, during, the, preceding, days, cicero, s, somnium, scipionis, described, a, lengthy, dream, vision, which, in, turn, was, commented, on, by, macrobius, in, his, commentarii, in, somnium, scipionis, herodotus, in, his, the, histories, writes, the, visions, that, occur, to, us, in, dreams, are, more, often, than, not, the, things, we, have, been, concerned, about, during, the, day, the, dreaming, is, a, common, term, within, the, animist, creation, narrative, of, indigenous, australians, for, a, personal, or, group, creation, and, for, what, may, be, understood, as, the, timeless, time, of, formative, creation, and, perpetual, creating, some, indigenous, american, tribes, and, mexican, populations, believe, that, dreams, are, a, way, of, visiting, and, having, contact, with, their, ancestors, some, native, american, tribes, have, used, vision, quests, as, a, rite, of, passage, fasting, and, praying, until, an, anticipated, guiding, dream, was, received, to, be, shared, with, the, rest, of, the, tribe, upon, their, return, beginning, in, the, late, 19th, century, austrian, neurologist, sigmund, freud, founder, of, psychoanalysis, theorized, that, dreams, reflect, the, dreamer, s, unconscious, mind, and, specifically, that, dream, content, is, shaped, by, unconscious, wish, fulfillment, he, argued, that, important, unconscious, desires, often, relate, to, early, childhood, memories, and, experiences, carl, jung, and, others, expanded, on, freud, s, idea, that, dream, content, reflects, the, dreamer, s, unconscious, desires, dream, interpretation, can, be, a, result, of, subjective, ideas, and, experiences, one, study, found, that, most, people, believe, that, their, dreams, reveal, meaningful, hidden, truths, the, researchers, surveyed, students, in, the, united, states, south, korea, and, india, and, found, that, 74, of, indians, 65, of, south, koreans, and, 56, of, americans, believed, their, dream, content, provided, them, with, meaningful, insight, into, their, unconscious, beliefs, and, desires, this, freudian, view, of, dreaming, was, believed, significantly, more, than, theories, of, dreaming, that, attribute, dream, content, to, memory, consolidation, problem, solving, or, as, a, byproduct, of, unrelated, brain, activity, the, same, study, found, that, people, attribute, more, importance, to, dream, content, than, to, similar, thought, content, that, occurs, while, they, are, awake, americans, were, more, likely, to, report, that, they, would, intentionally, miss, their, flight, if, they, dreamt, of, their, plane, crashing, than, if, they, thought, of, their, plane, crashing, the, night, before, flying, while, awake, and, that, they, would, be, as, likely, to, miss, their, flight, if, they, dreamt, of, their, plane, crashing, the, night, before, their, flight, as, if, there, was, an, actual, plane, crash, on, the, route, they, intended, to, take, participants, in, the, study, were, more, likely, to, perceive, dreams, to, be, meaningful, when, the, content, of, dreams, was, in, accordance, with, their, beliefs, and, desires, while, awake, they, were, more, likely, to, view, a, positive, dream, about, a, friend, to, be, meaningful, than, a, positive, dream, about, someone, they, disliked, for, example, and, were, more, likely, to, view, a, negative, dream, about, a, person, they, disliked, as, meaningful, than, a, negative, dream, about, a, person, they, liked, according, to, surveys, it, is, common, for, people, to, feel, their, dreams, are, predicting, subsequent, life, events, psychologists, have, explained, these, experiences, in, terms, of, memory, biases, namely, a, selective, memory, for, accurate, predictions, and, distorted, memory, so, that, dreams, are, retrospectively, fitted, onto, life, experiences, the, multi, faceted, nature, of, dreams, makes, it, easy, to, find, connections, between, dream, content, and, real, events, the, term, veridical, dream, has, been, used, to, indicate, dreams, that, reveal, or, contain, truths, not, yet, known, to, the, dreamer, whether, future, events, or, secrets, in, one, experiment, subjects, were, asked, to, write, down, their, dreams, in, a, diary, this, prevented, the, selective, memory, effect, and, the, dreams, no, longer, seemed, accurate, about, the, future, another, experiment, gave, subjects, a, fake, diary, of, a, student, with, apparently, precognitive, dreams, this, diary, described, events, from, the, person, s, life, as, well, as, some, predictive, dreams, and, some, non, predictive, dreams, when, subjects, were, asked, to, recall, the, dreams, they, had, read, they, remembered, more, of, the, successful, predictions, than, unsuccessful, ones, graphic, artists, writers, and, filmmakers, all, have, found, dreams, to, offer, a, rich, vein, for, creative, expression, in, the, west, artists, depictions, of, dreams, in, renaissance, and, baroque, art, often, were, related, to, biblical, narrative, especially, preferred, by, visual, artists, were, the, jacob, s, ladder, dream, in, genesis, and, st, joseph, s, dreams, in, the, gospel, according, to, matthew, many, later, graphic, artists, have, depicted, dreams, including,

the, first, recorded, mention, of, the, idea, was, in, the, 4th, century, bce, by, zhuangzi, and, in, eastern, philosophy, the, problem, has, been, named, the, zhuangzi, paradox, he, who, dreams, of, drinking, wine, may, weep, when, morning, comes, he, who, dreams, of, weeping, may, in, the, morning, go, off, to, hunt, while, he, is, dreaming, he, does, not, know, it, is, a, dream, and, in, his, dream, he, may, even, try, to, interpret, a, dream, only, after, he, wakes, does, he, know, it, was, a, dream, and, someday, there, will, be, a, great, awakening, when, we, know, that, this, is, all, a, great, dream, yet, the, stupid, believe, they, are, awake, busily, and, brightly, assuming, they, understand, things, calling, this, man, ruler, that, one, herdsman, how, dense, confucius, and, you, are, both, dreaming, and, when, i, say, you, are, dreaming, i, am, dreaming, too, words, like, these, will, be, labeled, the, supreme, swindle, yet, after, ten, thousand, generations, a, great, sage, may, appear, who, will, know, their, meaning, and, it, will, still, be, as, though, he, appeared, with, astonishing, speed, the, idea, also, is, discussed, in, hindu, and, buddhist, writings, it, was, formally, introduced, to, western, philosophy, by, descartes, in, the, 17th, century, in, his, meditations, on, first, philosophy, dreams, of, absent, minded, transgression, damt, are, dreams, wherein, the, dreamer, absent, mindedly, performs, an, action, that, he, or, she, has, been, trying, to, stop, one, classic, example, is, of, a, quitting, smoker, having, dreams, of, lighting, a, cigarette, subjects, who, have, had, damt, have, reported, waking, with, intense, feelings, of, guilt, one, study, found, a, positive, association, between, having, these, dreams, and,

term, for, a, broad, variety, of, experiences, research, by, harvard, psychologist, deirdre, barrett, has, found, that, people, who, experience, vivid, dreamlike, mental, images, reserve, the, word, for, these, whereas, many, other, people, refer, to, milder, imagery, realistic, future, planning, review, of, memories, or, just, spacing, out, i, e, one, s, mind, going, relatively, blank, when, they, talk, about, daydreaming, while, daydreaming, has, long, been, derided, as, a, lazy, non, productive, pastime, it, is, now, commonly, acknowledged, that, daydreaming, can, be, constructive, in, some, contexts, there, are, numerous, examples, of, people, in, creative, or, artistic, careers, such, as, composers, novelists, and, filmmakers, developing, new, ideas, through, daydreaming, similarly, research, scientists, mathematicians, and, physicists, have, developed, new, ideas, by, daydreaming, about, their, subject, areas, a, hallucination, in, the, broadest, sense, of, the, word, is, a, perception, in, the, absence, of, a, stimulus, in, a, stricter, sense, hallucinations, are, perceptions, in, a, conscious, and, awake, state, in, the, absence, of, external, stimuli, and, have, qualities, of, real, perception, in, that, they, are, vivid, substantial, and, located, in, external, objective, space, the, latter, definition, distinguishes, hallucinations, from, the, related, phenomena, of, dreaming, which, does, not, involve, wakefulness, a, nightmare, is, an, unpleasant, dream, that, can, cause, a, strong, negative, emotional, response, from, the, mind, typically, fear,
