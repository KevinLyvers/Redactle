a, currency, is, a, standardization, of, money, in, any, form, in, use, or, circulation, as, a, medium, of, exchange, for, example, banknotes, and, coins, a, more, general, definition, is, that, a, currency, is, a, system, of, money, in, common, use, within, a, specific, environment, over, time, especially, for, people, in, a, nation, state, under, this, definition, the, british, pound, sterling, euros, japanese, yen, and, u, s, dollars, us, are, examples, of, government, issued, fiat, currencies, currencies, may, act, as, stores, of, value, and, be, traded, between, nations, in, foreign, exchange, markets, which, determine, the, relative, values, of, the, different, currencies, currencies, in, this, sense, are, either, chosen, by, users, or, decreed, by, governments, and, each, type, has, limited, boundaries, of, acceptance, i, e, legal, tender, laws, may, require, a, particular, unit, of, account, for, payments, to, government, agencies, other, definitions, of, the, term, currency, appear, in, the, respective, synonymous, articles, banknote, coin, and, money, this, article, uses, the, definition, which, focuses, on, the, currency, systems, of, countries, one, can, classify, currencies, into, three, monetary, systems, fiat, money, commodity, money, and, representative, money, depending, on, what, guarantees, a, currency, s, value, the, economy, at, large, vs, the, government, s, precious, metal, reserves, some, currencies, function, as, legal, tender, in, certain, jurisdictions, or, for, specific, purposes, such, as, payment, to, a, government, taxes, or, government, agencies, fees, fines, others, simply, get, traded, for, their, economic, value, the, concept, of, a, digital, currency, has, arisen, in, recent, years, whether, government, backed, digital, notes, and, coins, such, as, the, digital, renminbi, in, china, for, example, will, be, successfully, developed, and, implemented, remains, unknown, digital, currencies, that, are, not, issued, by, a, government, monetary, authority, such, as, cryptocurrencies, like, bitcoin, are, different, because, their, value, is, market, dependent, and, has, no, safety, net, various, countries, have, expressed, concern, about, the, opportunities, that, cryptocurrencies, create, for, illegal, activities, such, as, scams, ransomware, extortion, money, laundering, and, terrorism, in, 2014, the, united, states, irs, advised, that, virtual, currency, is, treated, as, property, for, federal, income, tax, purposes, and, it, provides, examples, of, how, long, standing, tax, principles, applicable, to, transactions, involving, property, apply, to, virtual, currency, originally, currency, was, a, form, of, receipt, representing, grain, stored, in, temple, granaries, in, sumer, in, ancient, mesopotamia, and, in, ancient, egypt, in, this, first, stage, of, currency, metals, were, used, as, symbols, to, represent, value, stored, in, the, form, of, commodities, this, formed, the, basis, of, trade, in, the, fertile, crescent, for, over, 1500, years, however, the, collapse, of, the, near, eastern, trading, system, pointed, to, a, flaw, in, an, era, where, there, was, no, place, that, was, safe, to, store, value, the, value, of, a, circulating, medium, could, only, be, as, sound, as, the, forces, that, defended, that, store, a, trade, could, only, reach, as, far, as, the, credibility, of, that, military, by, the, late, bronze, age, however, a, series, of, treaties, had, established, safe, passage, for, merchants, around, the, eastern, mediterranean, spreading, from, minoan, crete, and, mycenae, in, the, northwest, to, elam, and, bahrain, in, the, southeast, it, is, not, known, what, was, used, as, a, currency, for, these, exchanges, but, it, is, thought, that, oxhide, shaped, ingots, of, copper, produced, in, cyprus, may, have, functioned, as, a, currency, it, is, thought, that, the, increase, in, piracy, and, raiding, associated, with, the, bronze, age, collapse, possibly, produced, by, the, peoples, of, the, sea, brought, the, trading, system, of, oxhide, ingots, to, an, end, it, was, only, the, recovery, of, phoenician, trade, in, the, 10th, and, 9th, centuries, bc, that, led, to, a, return, to, prosperity, and, the, appearance, of, real, coinage, possibly, first, in, anatolia, with, croesus, of, lydia, and, subsequently, with, the, greeks, and, persians, in, africa, many, forms, of, value, store, have, been, used, including, beads, ingots, ivory, various, forms, of, weapons, livestock, the, manilla, currency, shell, money, and, ochre, and, other, earth, oxides, the, manilla, rings, of, west, africa, were, one, of, the, currencies, used, from, the, 15th, century, onwards, to, sell, slaves, african, currency, is, still, notable, for, its, variety, and, in, many, places, various, forms, of, barter, still, apply, the, prevalence, of, metal, coins, possibly, led, to, the, metal, itself, being, the, store, of, value, first, copper, then, both, silver, and, gold, and, at, one, point, also, bronze, today, other, non, precious, metals, are, used, for, coins, metals, were, mined, weighed, and, stamped, into, coins, this, was, to, assure, the, individual, accepting, the, coin, that, he, was, getting, a, certain, known, weight, of, precious, metal, coins, could, be, counterfeited, but, the, existence, of, standard, coins, also, created, a, new, unit, of, account, which, helped, lead, to, banking, archimedes, principle, provided, the, next, link, coins, could, now, be, easily, tested, for, their, fine, weight, of, the, metal, and, thus, the, value, of, a, coin, could, be, determined, even, if, it, had, been, shaved, debased, or, otherwise, tampered, with, see, numismatics, most, major, economies, using, coinage, had, several, tiers, of, coins, of, different, values, made, of, copper, silver, and, gold, gold, coins, were, the, most, valuable, and, were, used, for, large, purchases, payment, of, the, military, and, backing, of, state, activities, units, of, account, were, often, defined, as, the, value, of, a, particular, type, of, gold, coin, silver, coins, were, used, for, midsized, transactions, and, sometimes, also, defined, a, unit, of, account, while, coins, of, copper, or, silver, or, some, mixture, of, them, see, debasement, might, be, used, for, everyday, transactions, this, system, had, been, used, in, ancient, india, since, the, time, of, the, mahajanapadas, the, exact, ratios, between, the, values, of, the, three, metals, varied, greatly, between, different, eras, and, places, for, example, the, opening, of, silver, mines, in, the, harz, mountains, of, central, europe, made, silver, relatively, less, valuable, as, did, the, flood, of, new, world, silver, after, the, spanish, conquests, however, the, rarity, of, gold, consistently, made, it, more, valuable, than, silver, and, likewise, silver, was, consistently, worth, more, than, copper, in, premodern, china, the, need, for, lending, and, for, a, medium, of, exchange, that, was, less, physically, cumbersome, than, large, numbers, of, copper, coins, led, to, the, introduction, of, paper, money, i, e, banknotes, their, introduction, was, a, gradual, process, that, lasted, from, the, late, tang, dynasty, 618, 907, into, the, song, dynasty, 960, 1279, it, began, as, a, means, for, merchants, to, exchange, heavy, coinage, for, receipts, of, deposit, issued, as, promissory, notes, by, wholesalers, shops, these, notes, were, valid, for, temporary, use, in, a, small, regional, territory, in, the, 10th, century, the, song, dynasty, government, began, to, circulate, these, notes, amongst, the, traders, in, its, monopolized, salt, industry, the, song, government, granted, several, shops, the, right, to, issue, banknotes, and, in, the, early, 12th, century, the, government, finally, took, over, these, shops, to, produce, state, issued, currency, yet, the, banknotes, issued, were, still, only, locally, and, temporarily, valid, it, was, not, until, the, mid, 13th, century, that, a, standard, and, uniform, government, issue, of, paper, money, became, an, acceptable, nationwide, currency, the, already, widespread, methods, of, woodblock, printing, and, then, bi, sheng, s, movable, type, printing, by, the, 11th, century, were, the, impetus, for, the, mass, production, of, paper, money, in, premodern, china, at, around, the, same, time, in, the, medieval, islamic, world, a, vigorous, monetary, economy, was, created, during, the, 7th, 12th, centuries, on, the, basis, of, the, expanding, levels, of, circulation, of, a, stable, high, value, currency, the, dinar, innovations, introduced, by, muslim, economists, traders, and, merchants, include, the, earliest, uses, of, credit, cheques, promissory, notes, savings, accounts, transaction, accounts, loaning, trusts, exchange, rates, the, transfer, of, credit, and, debt, and, banking, institutions, for, loans, and, deposits, in, europe, paper, currency, was, first, introduced, on, a, regular, basis, in, sweden, in, 1661, although, washington, irving, records, an, earlier, emergency, use, of, it, by, the, spanish, in, a, siege, during, the, conquest, of, granada, as, sweden, was, rich, in, copper, many, copper, coins, were, in, circulation, but, its, relatively, low, value, necessitated, extraordinarily, big, coins, often, weighing, several, kilograms, the, advantages, of, paper, currency, were, numerous, it, reduced, the, need, to, transport, gold, and, silver, which, was, risky, it, facilitated, loans, of, gold, or, silver, at, interest, since, the, underlying, specie, money, in, the, form, of, gold, or, silver, coins, rather, than, notes, never, left, the, possession, of, the, lender, until, someone, else, redeemed, the, note, and, it, allowed, a, division, of, currency, into, credit, and, specie, backed, forms, it, enabled, the, sale, of, investment, in, joint, stock, companies, and, the, redemption, of, those, shares, in, a, paper, but, there, were, also, disadvantages, first, since, a, note, has, no, intrinsic, value, there, was, nothing, to, stop, issuing, authorities, from, printing, more, notes, than, they, had, specie, to, back, them, with, second, because, this, increased, the, money, supply, it, increased, inflationary, pressures, a, fact, observed, by, david, hume, in, the, 18th, century, thus, paper, money, would, often, lead, to, an, inflationary, bubble, which, could, collapse, if, people, began, demanding, hard, money, causing, the, demand, for, paper, notes, to, fall, to, zero, the, printing, of, paper, money, was, also, associated, with, wars, and, financing, of, wars, and, therefore, regarded, as, part, of, maintaining, a, standing, army, for, these, reasons, paper, currency, was, held, in, suspicion, and, hostility, in, europe, and, america, it, was, also, addictive, since, the, speculative, profits, of, trade, and, capital, creation, were, quite, large, major, nations, established, mints, to, print, money, and, mint, coins, and, branches, of, their, treasury, to, collect, taxes, and, hold, gold, and, silver, stock, at, that, time, both, silver, and, gold, were, considered, a, legal, tender, and, accepted, by, governments, for, taxes, however, the, instability, in, the, exchange, rate, between, the, two, grew, over, the, course, of, the, 19th, century, with, the, increases, both, in, the, supply, of, these, metals, particularly, silver, and, in, trade, the, parallel, use, of, both, metals, is, called, bimetallism, and, the, attempt, to, create, a, bimetallic, standard, where, both, gold, and, silver, backed, currency, remained, in, circulation, occupied, the, efforts, of, inflationists, governments, at, this, point, could, use, currency, as, an, instrument, of, policy, printing, paper, currency, such, as, the, united, states, greenback, to, pay, for, military, expenditures, they, could, also, set, the, terms, at, which, they, would, redeem, notes, for, specie, by, limiting, the, amount, of, purchase, or, the, minimum, amount, that, could, be, redeemed, by, 1900, most, of, the, industrializing, nations, were, on, some, form, of, gold, standard, with, paper, notes, and, silver, coins, constituting, the, circulating, medium, private, banks, and, governments, across, the, world, followed, gresham, s, law, keeping, the, gold, and, silver, they, received, but, paying, out, in, notes, this, did, not, happen, all, around, the, world, at, the, same, time, but, occurred, sporadically, generally, in, times, of, war, or, financial, crisis, beginning, in, the, early, 20th, century, and, continuing, across, the, world, until, the, late, 20th, century, when, the, regime, of, floating, fiat, currencies, came, into, force, one, of, the, last, countries, to, break, away, from, the, gold, standard, was, the, united, states, in, 1971, an, action, which, was, known, as, the, nixon, shock, no, country, has, an, enforceable, gold, standard, or, silver, standard, currency, system, a, banknote, or, a, bill, is, a, type, of, currency, and, it, is, commonly, used, as, legal, tender, in, many, jurisdictions, together, with, coins, banknotes, make, up, the, cash, form, of, a, currency, banknotes, were, initially, mostly, paper, but, australia, s, commonwealth, scientific, and, industrial, research, organisation, developed, a, polymer, currency, in, the, 1980s, it, went, into, circulation, on, the, nation, s, bicentenary, in, 1988, polymer, banknotes, had, already, been, introduced, in, the, isle, of, man, in, 1983, as, of, 2016, polymer, currency, is, used, in, over, 20, countries, over, 40, if, counting, commemorative, issues, and, dramatically, increases, the, life, span, of, banknotes, and, reduces, counterfeiting, the, currency, used, is, based, on, the, concept, of, lex, monetae, that, a, sovereign, state, decides, which, currency, it, shall, use, see, fiat, currency, in, 1978, the, international, organization, for, standardization, published, a, system, of, three, digit, alphabetic, codes, iso, 4217, to, denote, currencies, these, codes, are, based, on, two, initial, letters, allocated, to, a, specific, country, and, a, final, letter, denoting, a, specific, monetary, unit, of, account, many, currencies, use, a, currency, symbol, these, are, not, subject, to, international, standards, and, are, not, unique, the, dollar, sign, in, particular, has, many, uses, distinct, from, centrally, controlled, government, issued, currencies, private, decentralized, trust, reduced, networks, support, alternative, currencies, such, as, bitcoin, and, ethereum, s, ether, which, are, classified, as, cryptocurrency, since, transference, transactions, are, assured, through, cryptographic, signatures, validated, by, all, users, with, few, exceptions, these, currencies, are, not, asset, backed, the, u, s, commodity, futures, trading, commission, has, declared, bitcoin, and, by, extension, similar, products, to, be, a, commodity, under, the, commodity, exchange, act, there, are, also, branded, currencies, for, example, obligation, based, stores, of, value, such, as, quasi, regulated, bartercard, loyalty, points, credit, cards, airlines, or, game, credits, mmo, games, that, are, based, on, reputation, of, commercial, products, historically, pseudo, currencies, have, also, included, company, scrip, a, form, of, wages, that, could, only, be, exchanged, in, company, stores, owned, by, the, employers, modern, token, money, such, as, the, tokens, operated, by, local, exchange, trading, systems, lets, is, a, form, of, barter, rather, than, being, a, true, currency, the, currency, may, be, internet, based, and, digital, for, instance, bitcoin, is, not, tied, to, any, specific, country, or, the, imf, s, sdr, that, is, based, on, a, basket, of, currencies, and, assets, held, possession, and, sale, of, alternative, forms, of, currencies, is, often, outlawed, by, governments, in, order, to, preserve, the, legitimacy, of, the, constitutional, currency, for, the, benefit, of, all, citizens, for, example, article, i, section, 8, clause, 5, of, the, united, states, constitution, delegates, to, congress, the, power, to, coin, money, and, to, regulate, the, value, thereof, this, power, was, delegated, to, congress, in, order, to, establish, and, preserve, a, uniform, standard, of, value, and, to, insure, a, singular, monetary, system, for, all, purchases, and, debts, in, the, united, states, public, and, private, along, with, the, power, to, coin, money, the, united, states, congress, has, the, concurrent, power, to, restrain, the, circulation, of, money, which, is, not, issued, under, its, own, authority, in, order, to, protect, and, preserve, the, constitutional, currency, it, is, a, violation, of, federal, law, for, individuals, or, organizations, to, create, private, coin, or, currency, systems, to, compete, with, the, official, coinage, and, currency, of, the, united, states, commonly, a, central, bank, has, the, exclusive, power, to, issue, all, forms, of, currency, including, coins, and, banknotes, fiat, money, and, to, restrain, the, circulation, alternative, currencies, for, its, own, area, of, circulation, a, country, or, group, of, countries, it, regulates, the, production, of, currency, by, banks, credit, through, monetary, policy, an, exchange, rate, is, a, price, at, which, two, currencies, can, be, exchanged, against, each, other, this, is, used, for, trade, between, the, two, currency, zones, exchange, rates, can, be, classified, as, either, floating, or, fixed, in, the, former, day, to, day, movements, in, exchange, rates, are, determined, by, the, market, in, the, latter, governments, intervene, in, the, market, to, buy, or, sell, their, currency, to, balance, supply, and, demand, at, a, static, exchange, rate, in, cases, where, a, country, has, control, of, its, own, currency, that, control, is, exercised, either, by, a, central, bank, or, by, a, ministry, of, finance, the, institution, that, has, control, of, monetary, policy, is, referred, to, as, the, monetary, authority, monetary, authorities, have, varying, degrees, of, autonomy, from, the, governments, that, create, them, a, monetary, authority, is, created, and, supported, by, its, sponsoring, government, so, independence, can, be, reduced, by, the, legislative, or, executive, authority, that, creates, it, several, countries, can, use, the, same, name, for, their, own, separate, currencies, for, example, a, dollar, in, australia, canada, and, the, united, states, by, contrast, several, countries, can, also, use, the, same, currency, for, example, the, euro, or, the, cfa, franc, or, one, country, can, declare, the, currency, of, another, country, to, be, legal, tender, for, example, panama, and, el, salvador, have, declared, us, currency, to, be, legal, tender, and, from, 1791, to, 1857, spanish, dollars, were, legal, tender, in, the, united, states, at, various, times, countries, have, either, re, stamped, foreign, coins, or, used, currency, boards, issuing, one, note, of, currency, for, each, note, of, a, foreign, government, held, as, ecuador, currently, does, each, currency, typically, has, a, main, currency, unit, the, dollar, for, example, or, the, euro, and, a, fractional, unit, often, defined, as, 1, 100, of, the, main, unit, 100, cents, 1, dollar, 100, centimes, 1, franc, 100, pence, 1, pound, although, units, of, 1, 10, or, 1, 1000, occasionally, also, occur, some, currencies, do, not, have, any, smaller, units, at, all, such, as, the, icelandic, kr, na, and, the, japanese, yen, mauritania, and, madagascar, are, the, only, remaining, countries, that, have, theoretical, fractional, units, not, based, on, the, decimal, system, instead, the, mauritanian, ouguiya, is, in, theory, divided, into, 5, khoums, while, the, malagasy, ariary, is, theoretically, divided, into, 5, iraimbilanja, in, these, countries, words, like, dollar, or, pound, were, simply, names, for, given, weights, of, gold, due, to, inflation, khoums, and, iraimbilanja, have, in, practice, fallen, into, disuse, see, non, decimal, currencies, for, other, historic, currencies, with, non, decimal, divisions, subject, to, variation, around, the, world, local, currency, can, be, converted, to, another, currency, or, vice, versa, with, or, without, central, bank, government, intervention, such, conversions, take, place, in, the, foreign, exchange, market, based, on, the, above, restrictions, or, free, and, readily, conversion, features, currencies, are, classified, as, according, to, the, three, aspects, of, trade, in, goods, and, services, capital, flows, and, national, policies, the, supply, demand, relationship, of, different, currencies, determines, the, exchange, ratio, between, currencies, trade, in, goods, and, services, through, cost, transfer, goods, and, services, circulating, in, the, country, such, as, hotels, tourism, catering, advertising, household, services, will, indirectly, affect, the, trade, cost, of, goods, and, services, and, the, price, of, export, trade, therefore, services, and, goods, involved, in, international, trade, are, not, the, only, reason, affecting, the, exchange, rate, the, large, number, of, international, tourists, and, overseas, students, has, resulted, in, the, flow, of, services, and, goods, at, home, and, abroad, it, also, represents, that, the, competitiveness, of, global, goods, and, services, directly, affects, the, change, of, international, exchange, rates, capital, flows, national, currencies, will, be, traded, on, international, markets, for, investment, purposes, investment, opportunities, in, each, country, attract, other, countries, into, investment, programs, so, that, these, foreign, currencies, become, the, reserves, of, the, central, banks, of, each, country, the, exchange, rate, mechanism, in, which, currencies, are, quoted, continuously, between, countries, is, based, on, foreign, exchange, markets, in, which, currencies, are, invested, by, individuals, and, traded, or, speculated, by, central, banks, and, investment, institutions, in, addition, changes, in, interest, rates, capital, market, fluctuations, and, changes, in, investment, opportunities, will, affect, the, global, capital, inflows, and, outflows, of, countries, around, the, world, and, exchange, rates, will, fluctuate, accordingly, national, policies, the, country, s, foreign, trade, monetary, and, fiscal, policies, affect, the, exchange, rate, fluctuations, foreign, trade, includes, policies, such, as, tariffs, and, import, standards, for, commodity, exports, the, impact, of, monetary, policy, on, the, total, amount, and, yield, of, money, directly, determines, the, changes, in, the, international, exchange, rate, fiscal, policies, such, as, transfer, payments, taxation, ratios, and, other, factors, dominate, the, profitability, of, capital, and, economic, development, and, the, ratio, of, national, debt, issuance, to, deficit, determines, the, repayment, capacity, and, credit, rating, of, the, country, such, policies, determine, the, mechanism, of, linking, domestic, and, foreign, currencies, and, therefore, have, a, significant, impact, on, the, generation, of, exchange, rates, currency, convertibility, is, closely, linked, to, economic, development, and, finance, there, are, strict, conditions, for, countries, to, achieve, currency, convertibility, which, is, a, good, way, for, countries, to, improve, their, economies, the, currencies, of, some, countries, or, regions, in, the, world, are, freely, convertible, such, as, the, us, dollar, australian, dollar, and, japanese, yen, the, requirements, for, currency, convertibility, can, be, roughly, divided, into, four, parts, with, a, freely, convertible, currency, domestic, firms, will, have, to, compete, fiercely, with, their, foreign, counterparts, the, development, of, competition, among, them, will, affect, the, implementation, effect, of, currency, convertibility, in, addition, microeconomics, is, a, prerequisite, for, macroeconomic, conditions, since, currency, convertibility, is, the, cross, border, flow, of, goods, and, capital, it, will, have, an, impact, on, the, macro, economy, this, requires, that, the, national, economy, be, in, a, normal, and, orderly, state, that, is, there, is, no, serious, inflation, and, economic, overheating, in, addition, the, government, should, use, macro, policies, to, make, mature, adjustments, to, deal, with, the, impact, of, currency, exchange, on, the, economy, the, maintainability, of, international, balance, of, payments, is, the, main, performance, of, reasonable, economic, structure, currency, convertibility, not, only, causes, difficulties, in, the, sustainability, of, international, balance, of, payments, but, also, affects, the, government, s, direct, control, over, international, economic, transactions, to, eliminate, the, foreign, exchange, shortage, the, government, needs, adequate, international, reserves, the, level, of, exchange, rate, is, an, important, factor, in, maintaining, exchange, rate, stability, both, before, and, after, currency, convertibility, the, exchange, rate, of, freely, convertible, currency, is, too, high, or, too, low, which, can, easily, trigger, speculation, and, undermine, the, stability, of, macroeconomic, and, financial, markets, therefore, to, maintain, the, level, of, exchange, rate, a, proper, exchange, rate, regime, is, crucial, in, economics, a, local, currency, is, a, currency, not, backed, by, a, national, government, and, intended, to, trade, only, in, a, small, area, advocates, such, as, jane, jacobs, argue, that, this, enables, an, economically, depressed, region, to, pull, itself, up, by, giving, the, people, living, there, a, medium, of, exchange, that, they, can, use, to, exchange, services, and, locally, produced, goods, in, a, broader, sense, this, is, the, original, purpose, of, all, money, opponents, of, this, concept, argue, that, local, currency, creates, a, barrier, that, can, interfere, with, economies, of, scale, and, comparative, advantage, and, that, in, some, cases, they, can, serve, as, a, means, of, tax, evasion, local, currencies, can, also, come, into, being, when, there, is, economic, turmoil, involving, the, national, currency, an, example, of, this, is, the, argentinian, economic, crisis, of, 2002, in, which, ious, issued, by, local, governments, quickly, took, on, some, of, the, characteristics, of, local, currencies, one, of, the, best, examples, of, a, local, currency, is, the, original, lets, currency, founded, on, vancouver, island, in, the, early, 1980s, in, 1982, the, canadian, central, bank, s, lending, rates, ran, up, to, 14, which, drove, chartered, bank, lending, rates, as, high, as, 19, the, resulting, currency, and, credit, scarcity, left, island, residents, with, few, options, other, than, to, create, a, local, currency, the, following, table, are, estimates, of, the, 20, most, frequently, used, currencies, in, world, payments, in, july, 2024, by, swift, related, concepts, accounting, units, lists
