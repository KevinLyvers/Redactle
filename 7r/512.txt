political, parties, would, go, on, to, grant, women, the, right, to, vote, increasing, the, number, of, those, parties, potential, constituencies, national, and, international, organizations, formed, to, coordinate, efforts, towards, women, voting, especially, the, international, woman, suffrage, alliance, founded, in, 1904, in, berlin, germany, several, instances, occurred, in, recent, centuries,

years, after, 1869, a, number, of, provinces, held, by, the, british, and, russian, empires, conferred, women, s, suffrage, and, some, of, these, became, sovereign, nations, at, a, later, point, like, new, zealand, australia, and, finland, several, states, and, territories, of, the, united, states, such, as, wyoming, 1869, and, utah, 1870, also, granted, women, the, right, to, vote, women, who,

equal, suffrage, with, both, the, right, to, vote, and, to, stand, as, candidates, in, 1906, most, major, western, powers, extended, voting, rights, to, women, in, the, interwar, period, including, canada, 1917, germany, 1918, the, united, kingdom, 1918, for, some, women, 1928, for, all, women, austria, the, netherlands, 1919, and, the, united, states, 1920, notable, exceptions, in, europe, were, france, where, women, could, not, vote, until, 1944, greece, equal, voting, rights, for, women, did, not, exist, there, until, 1952, although, since, 1930, literate, women, were, able, to, vote, in, local, elections, and, switzerland, where, since, 1971, women, could, vote, at, the, federal, level, and, between, 1959, and, 1990, women, got, the, right, to, vote, at, the, local, canton, level, the, last, european, jurisdictions, to, give, women, the, right, to, vote, were, liechtenstein, in, 1984, and, the, swiss, canton, of, appenzell, innerrhoden, at, the, local, level, in, 1990, with, the, vatican, city, being, an, absolute, elective, monarchy, the, electorate, of, the, holy, see, the, conclave, is, composed, of, male, cardinals, rather, than, vatican, citizens, in, some, cases, of, direct, democracy, such, as, swiss, cantons, governed, by, landsgemeinden, objections, to, expanding, the, suffrage, claimed, that, logistical, limitations, and, the, absence, of, secret, ballot, made, it, impractical, as, well, as, unnecessary, others, such, as, appenzell, ausserrhoden, instead, abolished, the, system, altogether, for, both, women, and, men, leslie, hume, argues, that, the, first, world, war, changed, the, popular, mood, the, women, s, contribution, to, the, war, effort, challenged, the, notion, of, women, s, physical, and, mental, inferiority, and, made, it, more, difficult, to, maintain, that, women, were, both, by, constitution, and, temperament, unfit, to, vote, if, women, could, work, in, munitions, factories, it, seemed, both, ungrateful, and, illogical, to, deny, them, a, place, in, the, voting, booth, but, the, vote, was, much, more, than, simply, a, reward, for, war, work, the, point, was, that, women, s, participation, in, the, war, helped, to, dispel, the, fears, that, surrounded, women, s, entry, into, the, public, arena, pre, wwi, opponents, of, women, s, suffrage, such, as, the, women, s, national, anti, suffrage, league, cited, women, s, relative, inexperience, in, military, affairs, they, claimed, that, since, women, were, the, majority, of, the, population, women, should, vote, in, local, elections, but, due, to, a, lack, of, experience, in, military, affairs, they, asserted, that, it, would, be, dangerous, to, allow, them, to, vote, in, national, elections, extended, political, campaigns, by, women, and, their, supporters, were, necessary, to, gain, legislation, or, constitutional, amendments, for, women, s, suffrage, in, many, countries, limited, suffrage, for, women, was, granted, before, universal, suffrage, for, men, for, instance, literate, women, or, property, owners, were, granted, suffrage, before, all, men, received, it, the, united, nations, encouraged, women, s, suffrage, in, the, years, following, world, war, ii, and, the, convention, on, the, elimination, of, all, forms, of, discrimination, against, women, 1979, identifies, it, as, a, basic, right, with, 189, countries, currently, being, parties, to, this, convention, in, ancient, athens, often, cited, as, the, birthplace, of, democracy, only, adult, male, citizens, who, owned, land, were, permitted, to, vote, through, subsequent, centuries, europe, was, ruled, by, monarchs, though, various, forms, of, parliament, arose, at, different, times, the, high, rank, ascribed, to, abbesses, within, the, catholic, church, permitted, some, women, the, right, to, sit, and, vote, at, national, assemblies, as, with, various, high, ranking, abbesses, in, medieval, germany, who, were, ranked, among, the, independent, princes, of, the, empire, their, protestant, successors, enjoyed, the, same, privilege, almost, into, modern, times, marie, guyart, a, french, nun, who, worked, with, the, first, nations, people, of, canada, during, the, 17th, century, wrote, in, 1654, regarding, the, suffrage, practices, of, iroquois, women, these, female, chieftains, are, women, of, standing, amongst, the, savages, and, they, have, a, deciding, vote, in, the, councils, they, make, decisions, there, like, their, male, counterparts, and, it, is, they, who, even, delegated, as, first, ambassadors, to, discuss, peace, the, iroquois, like, many, first, nations, in, north, america, had, a, matrilineal, kinship, system, property, and, descent, were, passed, through, the, female, line, women, elders, voted, on, hereditary, male, chiefs, and, could, depose, them, the, first, independent, country, to, introduce, women, s, suffrage, was, arguably, sweden, in, sweden, conditional, women, s, suffrage, was, in, effect,

in, a, new, england, town, meeting, in, uxbridge, massachusetts, she, voted, on, at, least, three, occasions, unmarried, white, women, who, owned, property, could, vote, in, new, jersey, from, 1776, to, 1807, in, the, 1792, elections, in, sierra, leone, then, a, new, british, colony, all, heads, of, household, could, vote, and, one, third, were, ethnic, african, women, other, early, instances, of, women, s, suffrage, include, the, corsican, republic, 1755, the, pitcairn, islands, 1838, the, isle, of, man, 1881, and, franceville, 1889, 1890, but, some, of, these, operated, only, briefly, as, independent, states, and, others, were, not, clearly, independent, the, female, descendants, of, the, bounty, mutineers, who, lived, on, pitcairn, islands, could, vote, from, 1838, this, right, was, transferred, after, they, resettled, in, 1856, to, norfolk, island, now, an, australian, external, territory, the, emergence, of, modern, democracy, generally, began, with, male, citizens, obtaining, the, right, to, vote, in, advance, of, female, citizens, except, in, the, kingdom, of, hawai, i, where, universal, suffrage, was, introduced, in, 1840, without, mention, of, sex, however, a, constitutional, amendment, in, 1852, rescinded, female, voting, and, put, property, qualifications, on, male, voting, the, seed, for, the, first, woman, s, rights, convention, in, the, united, states, in, seneca, falls, new, york, was, planted, in, 1840, when, elizabeth, cady, stanton, met, lucretia, mott, at, the, world, anti, slavery, convention, in, london, the, conference, refused, to, seat, mott, and, other, women, delegates, from, the, u, s, because, of, their, sex, in, 1851, stanton, met, temperance, worker, susan, b, anthony, and, shortly, the, two, would, be, joined, in, the, long, struggle, to, secure, the, vote, for, women, in, the, u, s, in, 1868, anthony, encouraged, working, women, from, the, printing, and, sewing, trades, in, new, york, who, were, excluded, from, men, s, trade, unions, to, form, working, women, s, associations, as, a, delegate, to, the, national, labor, congress, in, 1868, anthony, persuaded, the, committee, on, female, labor, to, call, for, votes, for, women, and, equal, pay, for, equal, work, the, men, at, the, conference, deleted, the, reference, to, the, vote, in, the, us, women, in, the, wyoming, territory, were, permitted, to, both, vote,

representatives, but, did, not, specify, who, was, eligible, to, participate, in, the, election, of, it, some, academics, have, argued, that, this, omission, enabled, women, to, vote, in, the, first, elections, in, which, votes, were, cast, by, means, of, signatures, on, petitions, but, this, interpretation, remains, controversial, the, second, constitution, of, 1852, specified, that, suffrage, was, restricted, to, males, over, twenty, years, old, in, 1849, the, grand, duchy, of, tuscany, in, italy, was, the, first, european, state, to, have, a, law, that, provided, for, the, vote, of, women, for, administrative, elections, taking, up, a, tradition, that, was, already, informally, sometimes, present, in, italy, the, 1853, constitution, of, the, province, of, v, lez, in, the, republic, of, new, granada, modern, day, colombia, allowed, for, married, women, or, women, older, than, the, age, of, 21, the, right, to, vote, within, the, province, however, this, law, was, subsequently, annulled, by, the, supreme, court, of, the, republic, arguing, that, the, citizens, of, the, province, could, not, have, more, rights, than, those, already, guaranteed, to, the, citizens, of, the, other, provinces, of, the, country, thus, eliminating, female, suffrage, from, this, province, in, 1856, in, 1881, the, isle, of, man, an, internally, self, governing, dependent,

or, color, although, only, white, males, were, permitted, to, hold, office, for, countries, that, have, their, origins, in, self, governing, colonies, but, later, became, independent, nations, in, the, 20th, century, the, colony, of, new, zealand, was, the, first, to, acknowledge, women, s, right, to, vote, in, 1893, largely, due, to, a, movement, led, by, kate, sheppard, the, british, protectorate, of, cook, islands, rendered, the, same, right, in, 1893, as, well, another, british, colony, south, australia, followed, in, 1895, enacting, laws, which, not, only, extended, voting, to,

enacted, the, commonwealth, franchise, act, 1902, which, allowed, female, british, subjects, to, vote, and, stand, for, election, on, the, same, terms, as, men, however, many, indigenous, australians, remained, excluded, from, voting, federally, until, 1962, the, first, place, in, europe, to, introduce, women, s, suffrage, was, the, grand, duchy, of, finland, in, 1906, and, it, also, became, the, first, place, in, continental, europe, to, implement, racially, equal, suffrage, for, women, as, a, result, of, the, 1907, parliamentary, elections, finland, s, voters, elected, 19, women, as, the, first, female, members, of, a, representative, parliament, this, was, one, of, many, self, governing, actions, in, the, russian, autonomous, province, that, led, to, conflict, with, the, russian, governor, of, finland, ultimately, leading, to, the, creation, of, the, finnish, nation, in, 1917, in, the, years, before, world, war, i, women, in, norway, also, won, the, right, to, vote, during,

this, right, for, women, in, the, 1920s, by, the, time, french, women, were, granted, the, suffrage, in, july, 1944, by, charles, de, gaulle, s, government, in, exile, by, a, vote, of, 51, for, 16,

terms, of, diversity, the, greatest, achievement, of, the, 20th, century, woman, suffrage, movement, was, its, extremely, broad, class, base, one, major, division, especially, in, britain, was, between, suffragists, who, sought, to, create, change, constitutionally, and, suffragettes, led, by, english, political, activist, emmeline, pankhurst, who, in, 1903, formed, the, more, militant, women, s, social, and, political, union, pankhurst, would, not, be, satisfied, with, anything, but, action, on, the, question, of, women, s, enfranchisement, with, deeds, not, words, the, organization, s, motto, elizabeth, cady, stanton, and, lucretia, mott, were, the, first, two, women, in, america, to, organize, the, women, s, rights, convention, in, july, 1848, susan, b, anthony, later, joined, the, movement, and, helped, form, the, national, woman, s, suffrage, association, nwsa, in, may, 1869, their, goal, was, to, change, the, 15th, amendment, because, it, did, not, mention, nor, include, women, which, is, why, the, nwsa, protested, against, it, around, the, same, time, there, was, also, another, group, of, women, who, supported, the, 15th, amendment, and, they, called, themselves, american, woman, suffrage, association, awsa, the, american, women, suffrage, association, was, founded, by, lucy, stone, julia, ward, howe, and, thomas, wentworth, higginson, who,

condition, of, prostitutes, under, the, leadership, of, frances, willard, the, wctu, became, the, largest, women, s, organization, of, its, day, and, is, now, the, oldest, continuing, women, s, organization, in, the, united, states, there, was, also, a, diversity, of, views, on, a, woman, s, place, suffragist, themes, often, included, the, notions, that, women, were, naturally, kinder, and, more, concerned, about, children, and, the, elderly, as, kraditor, shows, it, was, often, assumed, that, women, voters, would, have, a, civilizing, effect, on, politics, opposing, domestic, violence, liquor, and, emphasizing, cleanliness, and, community, an, opposing, theme, kraditor, argues, held, that, women, had, the, same, moral, standards, they, should, be, equal, in, every, way, and, that, there, was, no, such, thing, as, a, woman, s, natural, role, for, black, women, in, the, united, states, achieving, suffrage, was, a, way, to, counter, the, disfranchisement, of, the, men, of, their, race, despite, this, discouragement, black, suffragists, continued, to, insist, on, their, equal, political, rights, starting, in, the, 1890s, african, american, women, began, to, assert, their, political, rights, aggressively, from, within, their, own, clubs, and, suffrage, societies, if, white, american, women, with, all, their, natural, and, acquired, advantages, need, the, ballot, argued, adella, hunt, logan, of, tuskegee, alabama, how, much, more, do, black, americans, male, and, female, need, the, strong, defense, of, a, vote, to, help, secure, their, right, to, life, liberty, and, the, pursuit, of, happiness, scholars, have, proposed, different, theories, for, variations, in, the, timing, of, women, s, suffrage, across, countries, these, explanations, include, the, activism, of, social, movements, cultural, diffusion, and, normative, change, the, electoral, calculations, of, political, parties, and, the, occurrence, of, major, wars, according, to, adam, przeworski, women, s, suffrage, tends, to, be, extended, in, the, aftermath, of, major, wars, scholars, have, linked, women, s, suffrage, to, subsequent, economic, growth, the, rise, of, the, welfare, state, and, less,

applied, to, women, as, well, as, men, if, they, filled, the, qualifications, of, a, voting, citizen, these, qualifications, were, changed, during, the, course, of, the, 18th, century, as, well, as, the, local, interpretation, of, the, credentials, affecting, the, number, of, qualified, voters, the, qualifications, also, differed, between, cities, and, countryside, as, well, as, local, or, national, elections, initially, the, right, to, vote, in, local, city, elections, mayoral, elections, was, granted, to, every, burgher, which, was, defined, as, a, taxpaying, citizen, with, a, guild, membership, women, as, well, as, men, were, members, of, guilds, which, resulted, in, women, s, suffrage, for, a, limited, number, of, women, in, 1734, suffrage, in, both, national, and, local, elections, in, cities, as, well, as, countryside, was, granted, to, every, property, owning, taxpaying, citizen, of, legal, majority, this, extended, suffrage, to, all, taxpaying, property, owning,

preferred, to, appoint, a, male, to, vote, for, them, by, proxy, in, the, city, hall, because, they, found, it, embarrassing, to, do, so, in, person, which, was, cited, as, a, reason, to, abolish, women, s, suffrage, by, its, opponents, the, custom, to, appoint, to, vote, by, proxy, was, however, used, also, by, males, and, it, was, in, fact, common, for, men, who, were, absent, or, ill, during, elections, to, appoint, their, wives, to, vote, for, them, in, vaasa, in, finland, then, a, swedish, province, there, was, opposition, against, women, participating, in, the, town, hall,

elections, women, participated, in, all, of, the, eleven, national, elections, held, up, until, 1757, in, 1772, women, s, suffrage, in, national, elections, was, abolished, by, demand, from, the, burgher, estate, women, s, suffrage, was, first, abolished, for, taxpaying, unmarried, women, of, legal, majority, and, then, for, widows, however, the, local, interpretation, of, the, prohibition, of, women, s, suffrage, varied, and, some, cities, continued, to, allow, women, to, vote, in, kalmar, v, xj, v, stervik, simrishamn, ystad, m, l, karlstad, bergslagen, dalarna, and, norrland, women, were, allowed, to, continue, to, vote, despite, the, 1772, ban, while, in, lund, uppsala, skara, bo, gothenburg, and, marstrand, women, were, strictly, barred, from, the, vote, after, 1772, while,
