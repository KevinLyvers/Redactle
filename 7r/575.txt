significant, changes, to, the, media, landscape, since, the, turn, of, the, 21st, century, this, has, created, a, shift, in, the, consumption, of, print, media, channels, as, people, increasingly, consume, news, through, e, readers, smartphones, and, other, personal, electronic, devices, as, opposed, to, the, more, traditional, formats, of, newspapers, magazines, or, television, news, channels,

gifts, disclose, that, they, received, the, products, for, free, this, is, intended, to, eliminate, conflicts, of, interest, and, protect, consumers, in, the, us, many, credible, news, organizations, are, incorporated, entities, have, an, editorial, board, and, exhibit, separate, editorial, and, advertising, departments, many, credible, news, organizations, or, their, employees, often, belong, to, and, abide, by, the, ethics, of, professional, organizations, such, as, the, american, society, of, news, editors, the, society, of, professional, journalists, investigative, reporters, editors, inc, or, the, online, news, association, many, news, organizations, also, have, their, own, codes, of, ethics, that, guide, journalists, professional, publications, for, instance, the, new, york, times, code, of, standards, and, ethics, is, considered, particularly, rigorous, when, crafting, news, stories, regardless, of, the, medium, fairness, and, bias, are, issues, of, concern, to, journalists, some, stories, are, intended, to, represent, the, author, s, own, opinion, others, are, more, neutral, or, feature, balanced, points, of, view, in, a, traditional, print, newspaper, and, its, online, version, information, is, organized, into, sections, this, makes, clear, the, distinction, between, content, based, on, fact, and, on, opinion, in, other, media, many, of, these, distinctions, break, down, readers, should, pay, careful, attention, to, headings, and, other, design, elements, to, ensure, that, they, understand, the, journalist, s, intent, opinion, pieces, are, generally, written, by, regular, columnists, or, appear, in, a, section, titled, op, ed, these, reflect, a, journalist, s, own, opinions, and, ideology, while, feature, stories, breaking, news, and, hard, news, stories, typically, make, efforts, to, remove, opinion, from, the, copy, according, to, robert, mcchesney, healthy, journalism, in, a, democratic, country, must, provide, an, opinion, of, people, in, power, and, who, wish, to, be, in, power, must, include, a, range, of, opinions, and, must, regard, the, informational, needs, of, all, people, many, debates, centre, on, whether, journalists, are, supposed, to, be, objective, and, neutral, arguments, include, the, fact, that, journalists, produce, news, out, of, and, as, part, of, a, particular, social, context, and, that, they, are, guided, by, professional, codes, of, ethics, and, do, their, best, to, represent, all, legitimate, points, of, view, additionally, the, ability, to, render, a, subject, s, complex, and, fluid, narrative, with, sufficient, accuracy, is, sometimes, challenged, by, the, time, available, to, spend, with, subjects, the, affordances, or, constraints, of, the, medium, used, to, tell, the, story, and, the, evolving, nature, of, people, s, identities, there, are, several, forms, of, journalism, with, diverse, audiences, journalism, is, said, to, serve, the, role, of, a, fourth, estate, acting, as, a, watchdog, on, the, workings, of, the, government, a, single, publication, such, as, a, newspaper, contains, many, forms, of, journalism, each, of, which, may, be, presented, in, different, formats, each, section, of, a, newspaper, magazine, or, website, may, cater, to, a, different, audience, some, forms, include, the, rise, of, social, media, has, drastically, changed, the, nature, of, journalistic, reporting, giving, rise, to, so, called, citizen, journalists, in, a, 2014, study, of, journalists, in, the, united, states, 40, of, participants, claimed, they, rely, on, social, media, as, a, source, with, over, 20, depending, on, microblogs, to, collect, facts, from, this, the, conclusion, can, be, drawn, that, breaking, news, nowadays, often, stems, from, user, generated, content, including, videos, and, pictures, posted, online, in, social, media, however, though, 69, 2, of, the, surveyed, journalists, agreed, that, social, media, allowed, them, to, connect, to, their, audience, only, 30, thought, it, had, a, positive, influence, on, news, credibility, in, addition, to, this, a, recent, study, done, by, pew, research, center, shows, that, eight, in, ten, americans, are, getting, their, news, from, digital, devices, consequently, this, has, resulted, in, arguments, to, reconsider, journalism, as, a, process, distributed, among, many, authors, including, the, socially, mediating, public, rather, than, as, individual, products, and, articles, written, by, dedicated, journalists, because, of, these, changes, the, credibility, ratings, of, news, outlets, has, reached, an, all, time, low, a, 2014, study, revealed, that, only, 22, of, americans, reported, a, great, deal, or, quite, a, lot, of, confidence, in, either, television, news, or, newspapers, fake, news, is, also, deliberately, untruthful, information, which, can, often, spread, quickly, on, social, media, or, by, means, of, fake, news, websites, news, cannot, be, regarded, as, fake, but, disinformation, rather, it, is, often, published, to, intentionally, mislead, readers, to, ultimately, benefit, a, cause, organization, or, an, individual, a, glaring, example, was, the, proliferation, of, fake, news, in, social, media, during, the, 2016, u, s, presidential, election, conspiracy, theories, hoaxes, and, lies, have, been, circulated, under, the, guise, of, news, reports, to, benefit, specific, candidates, one, example, is, a, fabricated, report, of, hillary, clinton, s, email, which, was, published, by, a, non, existent, newspaper, called, the, denver, guardian, many, critics, blamed, facebook, for, the, spread, of, such, material, its, news, feed, algorithm, in, particular, was, identified, by, vox, as, the, platform, where, the, social, media, giant, exercise, billions, of, editorial, decisions, every, day, social, media, platforms, such, as, facebook, twitter, and, tiktok, are, distributors, of, disinformation, or, fake, news, mark, zuckerberg, the, ceo, of, facebook, has, acknowledged, the, company, s, role, in, this, problem, in, a, testimony, before, a, combined, senate, judiciary, and, commerce, committee, hearing, on, 20, april, 2018, he, said, it, s, clear, now, that, we, didn, t, do, enough, to, prevent, these, tools, from, being, used, for, harm, as, well, that, goes, for, fake, news, foreign, interference, in, elections, and, hate, speech, as, well, as, developers, and, data, privacy, readers, can, often, evaluate, credibility, of, news, by, examining, the, credibility, of, the, underlying, news,

wasted, on, ordinary, citizens, but, was, of, genuine, value, to, an, elite, class, of, administrators, and, experts, dewey, on, the, other, hand, believed, not, only, that, the, public, was, capable, of, understanding, the, issues, created, or, responded, to, by, the, elite, but, also, that, it, was, in, the, public, forum, that, decisions, should, be, made, after, discussion, and, debate, when,

apply, to, the, acquisition, of, newsworthy, information, and, its, subsequent, dissemination, to, the, public, bill, kovach, and, tom, rosenstiel, propose, several, guidelines, for, journalists, in, their, book, the, elements, of, journalism, their, view, is, that, journalism, s, first, loyalty, is, to, the, citizenry, and, that, journalists, are, thus, obliged, to, tell, the, truth, and, must, serve, as, an, independent, monitor, of, powerful, individuals, and, institutions, within, society, in, this, view, the, essence, of, journalism, is, to, provide, citizens, with, reliable, information, through, the, discipline, of, verification, some, journalistic, codes, of, ethics, notably, the, european, ones, also, include, a, concern, with, discriminatory, references, in, news, based, on, race, religion, sexual, orientation, and, physical, or, mental, disabilities, the, parliamentary, assembly, of, the, council, of, europe, approved, in, 1993, resolution, 1003, on, the, ethics, of, journalism, which, recommends, journalists, to, respect, the, presumption, of, innocence, in, particular, in, cases, that, are, still, sub, judice, in, the, uk, all, newspapers, are, bound, by, the, code, of, practice, of, the, independent, press, standards, organisation, this, includes, points, like, respecting, people, s, privacy, and, ensuring, accuracy, however, the, media, standards, trust, has, criticized, the, pcc, claiming, it, needs, to, be, radically, changed, to, secure, the, public, trust, of, newspapers, this, is, in, stark, contrast, to, the, media, climate, prior, to, the, 20th, century, where, the, media, market, was, dominated, by, smaller, newspapers, and, pamphleteers, who, usually, had, an, overt, and, often, radical, agenda, with, no, presumption, of, balance, or, objectivity, because, of, the, pressure, on, journalists, to, report, news, promptly, and, before, their, competitors, factual, errors, occur, more, frequently, than, in, writing, produced, and, edited, under, less, time, pressure, thus, a, typical, issue, of, a, major, daily, newspaper, may, contain, several, corrections, of, articles, published, the, previous, day, perhaps, the, most, famous, journalistic, mistake, caused, by, time, pressure, was, the, dewey, defeats, truman, edition, of, the, chicago, daily, tribune, based, on, early, election, returns, that, failed, to, anticipate, the, actual, result, of, the, 1948, us, presidential, election, there, are, over, 242, codes, of, ethics, in, journalism, that, vary, across, various, regions, of, the, world, the, codes, of, ethics, are, created, through, an, interaction, of, different, groups, of, people, such, as, the, public, and, journalists, themselves, most, of, the, codes, of, ethics, serve, as, a, representation, of, the, economic, and, political, beliefs, of, the, society, where, the, code, was, written, despite, the, fact, that, there, are, a, variety, of, codes, of, ethics, some, of, the, core, elements, present, in, all, codes, are, remaining, objective, providing, the, truth, and, being, honest, journalism, does, not, have, a, universal, code, of, conduct, individuals, are, not, legally, obliged, to, follow, a, certain, set, of, rules, like, a, doctor, or, a, lawyer, does, there, have, been, discussions, for, creating, a, universal, code, of, conduct, in, journalism, one, suggestion, centers, on, having, three, claims, for, credibility, justifiable, consequence, and, the, claim, of, humanity, within, the, claim, of, credibility, journalists, are, expected, to, provide, the, public, with, reliable, and, trustworthy, information, and, allowing, the, public, to, question, the, nature, of, the, information, and, its, acquisition, the, second, claim, of, justifiable, consequences, centers, on, weighing, the, benefits, and, detriments, of, a, potentially, harmful, story, and, acting, accordingly, an, example, of, justifiable, consequence, is, exposing, a, professional, with, dubious, practices, on, the, other, hand, acting, within, justifiable, consequence, means, writing, compassionately, about, a, family, in, mourning, the, third, claim, is, the, claim, of, humanity, which, states, that, journalists, are, writing, for, a, global, population, and, therefore, must, serve, everyone, globally, in, their, work, avoiding, smaller, loyalties, to, country, city, etc, governments, have, widely, varying, policies, and, practices, towards, journalists, which, control, what, they, can, research, and, write, and, what, press, organizations, can, publish, some, governments, guarantee, the, freedom, of, the, press, while, other, nations, severely, restrict, what, journalists, can, research, or, publish, journalists, in, many, nations, have, some, privileges, that, members, of, the, general, public, do, not, including, better, access, to, public, events, crime, scenes, and, press, conferences, and, to, extended, interviews, with, public, officials, celebrities, and, others, in, the, public, eye, journalists, who, elect, to, cover, conflicts, whether, wars, between, nations, or, insurgencies, within, nations, often, give, up, any, expectation, of, protection, by, government, if, not, giving, up, their, rights, to, protection, from, the, government, journalists, who, are, captured, or, detained, during, a, conflict, are, expected, to, be, treated, as, civilians, and, to, be, released, to, their, national, government, many, governments, around, the, world, target, journalists, for, intimidation, harassment, and, violence, because, of, the, nature, of, their, work, journalists, interaction, with, sources, sometimes, involves, confidentiality, an, extension, of, freedom, of, the, press, giving, journalists, a, legal, protection, to, keep, the, identity, of, a, confidential, informant, private, even, when, demanded, by, police, or, prosecutors, withholding, their, sources, can, land, journalists, in, contempt, of, court, or, in, jail, in, the, united, states, there, is, no, right, to, protect, sources, in, a, federal, court, however, federal, courts, will, refuse, to, force, journalists, to, reveal, their, sources, unless, the, information, the, court, seeks, is, highly, relevant, to, the, case, and, there, is, no, other, way, to, get, it, state, courts, provide, varying, degrees, of, such, protection, journalists, who, refuse, to, testify, even, when, ordered, to, can, be, found, in, contempt, of, court, and, fined, or, jailed, on, the, journalistic, side, of, keeping, sources, confidential, there, is, also, a, risk, to, the, journalist, s, credibility, because, there, can, be, no, actual, confirmation, of, whether, the, information, is, valid, as, such, it, is, highly, discouraged, for, journalists, to, have, confidential, sources
