comparative, linguistics, is, a, branch, of, historical, linguistics, that, is, concerned, with, comparing, languages, to, establish, their, historical, relatedness, genetic, relatedness, implies, a, common, origin, or, proto, language, and, comparative, linguistics, aims, to, construct, language, families, to, reconstruct, proto, languages, and, specify, the, changes, that, have, resulted, in, the, documented, languages, to, maintain, a, clear, distinction, between, attested, and, reconstructed, forms, comparative, linguists, prefix, an, asterisk, to, any, form, that, is, not, found, in, surviving, texts, a, number, of, methods, for, carrying, out, language, classification, have, been, developed, ranging, from, simple, inspection, to, computerised, hypothesis, testing, such, methods, have, gone, through, a, long, process, of, development, the, fundamental, technique, of, comparative, linguistics, is, to, compare, phonological, systems, morphological, systems, syntax, and, the, lexicon, of, two, or, more, languages, using, techniques, such, as, the, comparative, method, in, principle, every, difference, between, two, related, languages, should, be, explicable, to, a, high, degree, of, plausibility, systematic, changes, for, example, in, phonological, or, morphological, systems, are, expected, to, be, highly, regular, consistent, in, practice, the, comparison, may, be, more, restricted, e, g, just, to, the, lexicon, in, some, methods, it, may, be, possible, to, reconstruct, an, earlier, proto, language, although, the, proto, languages, reconstructed, by, the, comparative, method, are, hypothetical, a, reconstruction, may, have, predictive, power, the, most, notable, example, of, this, is, ferdinand, de, saussure, s, proposal, that, the, indo, european, consonant, system, contained, laryngeals, a, type, of, consonant, attested, in, no, indo, european, language, known, at, the, time, the, hypothesis, was, vindicated, with, the, discovery, of, hittite, which, proved, to, have, exactly, the, consonants, saussure, had, hypothesized, in, the, environments, he, had, predicted, where, languages, are, derived, from, a, very, distant, ancestor, and, are, thus, more, distantly, related, the, comparative, method, becomes, less, practicable, in, particular, attempting, to, relate, two, reconstructed, proto, languages, by, the, comparative, method, has, not, generally, produced, results, that, have, met, with, wide, acceptance, the, method, has, also, not, been, very, good, at, unambiguously, identifying, sub, families, thus, different, scholars, have, produced, conflicting, results, for, example, in, indo, european, a, number, of, methods, based, on, statistical, analysis, of, vocabulary, have, been, developed, to, try, and, overcome, this, limitation, such, as, lexicostatistics, and, mass, comparison, the, former, uses, lexical, cognates, like, the, comparative, method, while, the, latter, uses, only, lexical, similarity, the, theoretical, basis, of, such, methods, is, that, vocabulary, items, can, be, matched, without, a, detailed, language, reconstruction, and, that, comparing, enough, vocabulary, items, will, negate, individual, inaccuracies, thus, they, can, be, used, to, determine, relatedness, but, not, to, determine, the, proto, language, the, earliest, method, of, this, type, was, the, comparative, method, which, was, developed, over, many, years, culminating, in, the, nineteenth, century, this, uses, a, long, word, list, and, detailed, study, however, it, has, been, criticized, for, example, as, subjective, informal, and, lacking, testability, the, comparative, method, uses, information, from, two, or, more, languages, and, allows, reconstruction, of, the, ancestral, language, the, method, of, internal, reconstruction, uses, only, a, single, language, with, comparison, of, word, variants, to, perform, the, same, function, internal, reconstruction, is, more, resistant, to, interference, but, usually, has, a, limited, available, base, of, utilizable, words, and, is, able, to, reconstruct, only, certain, changes, those, that, have, left, traces, as, morphophonological, variations, in, the, twentieth, century, an, alternative, method, lexicostatistics, was, developed, which, is, mainly, associated, with, morris, swadesh, but, is, based, on, earlier, work, this, uses, a, short, word, list, of, basic, vocabulary, in, the, various, languages, for, comparisons, swadesh, used, 100, earlier, 200, items, that, are, assumed, to, be, cognate, on, the, basis, of, phonetic, similarity, in, the, languages, being, compared, though, other, lists, have, also, been, used, distance, measures, are, derived, by, examination, of, language, pairs, but, such, methods, reduce, the, information, an, outgrowth, of, lexicostatistics, is, glottochronology, initially, developed, in, the, 1950s, which, proposed, a, mathematical, formula, for, establishing, the, date, when, two, languages, separated, based, on, percentage, of, a, core, vocabulary, of, culturally, independent, words, in, its, simplest, form, a, constant, rate, of, change, is, assumed, though, later, versions, allow, variance, but, still, fail, to, achieve, reliability, glottochronology, has, met, with, mounting, scepticism, and, is, seldom, applied, today, dating, estimates, can, now, be, generated, by, computerised, methods, that, have, fewer, restrictions, calculating, rates, from, the, data, however, no, mathematical, means, of, producing, proto, language, split, times, on, the, basis, of, lexical, retention, has, been, proven, reliable, another, controversial, method, developed, by, joseph, greenberg, is, mass, comparison, the, method, which, disavows, any, ability, to, date, developments, aims, simply, to, show, which, languages, are, more, and, less, close, to, each, other, greenberg, suggested, that, the, method, is, useful, for, preliminary, grouping, of, languages, known, to, be, related, as, a, first, step, toward, more, in, depth, comparative, analysis, however, since, mass, comparison, eschews, the, establishment, of, regular, changes, it, is, flatly, rejected, by, the, majority, of, historical, linguists, recently, computerised, statistical, hypothesis, testing, methods, have, been, developed, which, are, related, to, both, the, comparative, method, and, lexicostatistics, character, based, methods, are, similar, to, the, former, and, distanced, based, methods, are, similar, to, the, latter, see, quantitative, comparative, linguistics, the, characters, used, can, be, morphological, or, grammatical, as, well, as, lexical, since, the, mid, 1990s, these, more, sophisticated, tree, and, network, based, phylogenetic, methods, have, been, used, to, investigate, the, relationships, between, languages, and, to, determine, approximate, dates, for, proto, languages, these, are, considered, by, many, to, show, promise, but, are, not, wholly, accepted, by, traditionalists, however, they, are, not, intended, to, replace, older, methods, but, to, supplement, them, such, statistical, methods, cannot, be, used, to, derive, the, features, of, a, proto, language, apart, from, the, fact, of, the, existence, of, shared, items, of, the, compared, vocabulary, these, approaches, have, been, challenged, for, their, methodological, problems, since, without, a, reconstruction, or, at, least, a, detailed, list, of, phonological, correspondences, there, can, be, no, demonstration, that, two, words, in, different, languages, are, cognate, there, are, other, branches, of, linguistics, that, involve, comparing, languages, which, are, not, however, part, of, comparative, linguistics, comparative, linguistics, includes, the, study, of, the, historical, relationships, of, languages, using, the, comparative, method, to, search, for, regular, i, e, recurring, correspondences, between, the, languages, phonology, grammar, and, core, vocabulary, and, through, hypothesis, testing, some, persons, with, little, or, no, specialization, in, the, field, sometimes, attempt, to, establish, historical, associations, between, languages, by, noting, similarities, between, them, in, a, way, that, is, considered, pseudoscientific, by, specialists, e, g, spurious, comparisons, between, ancient, egyptian, and, languages, like, wolof, as, proposed, by, diop, in, the, 1960s, the, most, common, method, applied, in, pseudoscientific, language, comparisons, is, to, search, two, or, more, languages, for, words, that, seem, similar, in, their, sound, and, meaning, while, similarities, of, this, kind, often, seem, convincing, to, laypersons, linguistic, scientists, consider, this, kind, of, comparison, to, be, unreliable, for, two, primary, reasons, first, the, method, applied, is, not, well, defined, the, criterion, of, similarity, is, subjective, and, thus, not, subject, to, verification, or, falsification, which, is, contrary, to, the, principles, of, the, scientific, method, second, the, large, size, of, all, languages, vocabulary, and, a, relatively, limited, inventory, of, articulated, sounds, used, by, most, languages, makes, it, easy, to, find, coincidentally, similar, words, between, languages, there, are, sometimes, political, or, religious, reasons, for, associating, languages, in, ways, that, some, linguists, would, dispute, for, example, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, turanian, or, ural, altaic, language, group, which, relates, sami, and, other, languages, to, the, mongolian, language, was, used, to, justify, racism, towards, the, sami, in, particular, there, are, also, strong, albeit, areal, not, genetic, similarities, between, the, uralic, and, altaic, languages, which, provided, an, innocent, basis, for, this, theory, in, 1930s, turkey, some, promoted, the, sun, language, theory, one, that, showed, that, turkic, languages, were, close, to, the, original, language, some, believers, in, abrahamic, religions, try, to, derive, their, native, languages, from, classical, hebrew, as, herbert, w, armstrong, a, proponent, of, british, israelism, who, said, that, the, word, british, comes, from, hebrew, brit, meaning, covenant, and, ish, meaning, man, supposedly, proving, that, the, british, people, are, the, covenant, people, of, god, and, lithuanian, american, archaeologist, marija, gimbutas, argued, during, the, mid, 1900s, that, basque, is, clearly, related, to, the, extinct, pictish, and, etruscan, languages, in, attempt, to, show, that, basque, was, a, remnant, of, an, old, european, culture, in, the, dissertatio, de, origine, gentium, americanarum, 1625, the, dutch, lawyer, hugo, grotius, proves, that, the, american, indians, mohawks, speak, a, language, lingua, maquaasiorum, derived, from, scandinavian, languages, grotius, was, on, sweden, s, payroll, supporting, swedish, colonial, pretensions, in, america, the, dutch, doctor, johannes, goropius, becanus, in, his, origines, antverpiana, 1580, admits, quis, est, enim, qui, non, amet, patrium, sermonem, who, does, not, love, his, fathers, language, whilst, asserting, that, hebrew, is, derived, from, dutch, the, frenchman, loi, johanneau, claimed, in, 1818, m, langes, d, origines, tymologiques, et, de, questions, grammaticales, that, the, celtic, language, is, the, oldest, and, the, mother, of, all, others, in, 1759, joseph, de, guignes, theorized, m, moire, dans, lequel, on, prouve, que, les, chinois, sont, une, colonie, gyptienne, that, the, chinese, and, egyptians, were, related, the, former, being, a, colony, of, the, latter, in, 1885, edward, tregear, the, aryan, maori, compared, the, maori, and, aryan, languages, jean, prat, in, his, 1941, les, langues, nitales, claimed, that, the, bantu, languages, of, africa, are, descended, from, latin, coining, the, french, linguistic, term, nitale, in, doing, so, just, as, egyptian, is, related, to, brabantic, following, becanus, in, his, hieroglyphica, still, using, comparative, methods, the, first, practitioners, of, comparative, linguistics, were, not, universally, acclaimed, upon, reading, becanus, book, scaliger, wrote, never, did, i, read, greater, nonsense, and, leibniz, coined, the, term, goropism, from, goropius, to, designate, a, far, sought, ridiculous, etymology, there, have, also, been, claims, that, humans, are, descended, from, other, non, primate, animals, with, use, of, the, voice, referred, to, as, the, main, point, of, comparison, jean, pierre, brisset, la, grande, nouvelle, around, 1900, believed, and, asserted, that, humans, descended, from, the, frog, by, linguistic, means, in, that, the, croaking, of, frogs, sounds, similar, to, spoken, french, he, held, that, the, french, word, logement, dwelling, derived, from, the, word, l, eau, water
