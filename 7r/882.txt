and, in, response, to, internal, disorganization, and, disillusionment, regarding, their, position, in, the, war, analyses, of, desertion, rates, argue, that, motivations, were, far, less, ideological, than, individual, accounts, claim, desertion, rates, increased, prior, to, announcements, of, upcoming, operations, and, were, highest, during, the, summer, and, winter, seasonal, desertions, were, probably, a, response, to, the, harsh, weather, conditions, of, the, winter, and, immense, field, work, required, in, the, summer, a, significant, jump, in, desertion, in, 1989, when, the, soviets, withdrew, from, afghanistan, may, suggest, a, higher, concern, regarding, returning, home, rather, than, an, overall, opposition, towards, the, war, itself, in, the, beginning, of, the, soviet, invasion, the, majority, of, soviet, forces, were, soldiers, of, central, asian, republics, the, soviets, believed, that, shared, ideologies, between, muslim, central, asians, and, afghan, soldiers, would, build, trust, and, morale, within, the, army, however, central, asians, longstanding, historical, frustrations, with, moscow, degraded, soldiers, willingness, to, fight, for, the, red, army, as, afghan, desertion, grew, and, soviet, opposition, was, strengthened, within, afghanistan, the, soviet, plan, overtly, backfired, the, personal, histories, of, central, asian, ethnic, groups, especially, between, pashtuns, uzbeks, and, tajiks, caused, tension, within, the, soviet, military, non, russian, ethnic, groups, easily, related, the, situation, in, afghanistan, to, communist, takeover, of, their, own, states, forced, induction, into, the, ussr, ethnic, russians, suspected, central, asians, of, opposition, and, fighting, within, the, army, was, prevalent, upon, entering, afghanistan, many, central, asians, were, exposed, to, the, qur, an, for, the, first, time, uninfluenced, by, soviet, propagandist, versions, and, felt, a, stronger, connection, towards, the, opposition, than, their, own, comrades, the, highest, rates, of, desertion, were, found, among, border, troops, ranging, from, 60, to, 80, during, the, first, year, of, the, soviet, invasion, in, these, areas, strong, ethnic, clashes, and, cultural, factors, influenced, desertion, as, afghan, soldiers, continued, to, desert, the, soviet, army, a, united, islamic, alliance, for, the, liberation, of, afghanistan, began, to, form, moderates, and, fundamentalists, banded, together, to, oppose, soviet, intervention, the, islamic, ideology, solidified, a, strong, base, of, opposition, by, january, 1980, overriding, ethnic, tribal, geographic, and, economic, differences, among, afghans, willing, to, fight, the, soviet, invasion, which, attracted, central, asian, deserters, by, march, 1980, the, soviet, army, made, an, executive, decision, to, replace, central, asian, troops, with, the, european, sectors, of, the, ussr, to, avoid, further, religious, and, ethnic, complications, drastically, reducing, soviet, forces, soviet, soldiers, entered, the, war, under, the, impression, that, their, roles, were, primarily, related, to, the, organization, of, afghan, forces, and, society, soviet, media, portrayed, the, soviet, intervention, as, a, necessary, means, of, protecting, the, communist, uprising, from, outside, opposition, propaganda, declared, that, soviets, were, providing, aid, to, villagers, and, improving, afghanistan, by, planting, trees, improving, public, buildings, and, generally, acting, as, good, neighbors, upon, entering, afghanistan, soviet, soldiers, became, immediately, aware, of, the, falsity, of, the, reported, situation, in, major, cities, afghan, youth, that, originally, supported, the, leftist, movement, soon, turned, to, soviet, oppositional, forces, for, patriotic, and, religious, reasons, the, opposition, built, resistance, in, cities, calling, soviet, soldiers, infidels, that, were, forcing, an, imperialist, communist, invasive, government, on, afghanistan, s, people, as, afghan, troops, continued, to, abandon, the, soviet, army, to, support, the, mujahideen, they, became, anti, russian, and, antigovernment, opposition, forces, emphasized, the, soviets, atheism, demanding, support, for, the, muslim, faith, from, civilians, the, hostility, shown, towards, soldiers, who, entered, the, war, believing, their, assistance, was, requested, grew, defensive, the, opposition, circulated, pamphlets, within, soviet, camps, stationed, in, cities, calling, for, afghan, freedom, from, the, aggressive, communist, influence, and, a, right, to, establish, their, own, government, the, native, afghan, army, fell, from, 90, 000, to, 30, 000, by, mid, 1980, forcing, soviets, into, more, extreme, combative, positions, the, mujahideen, s, widespread, presence, among, afghan, civilians, in, rural, regions, made, it, difficult, for, soviet, soldiers, to, distinguish, between, the, civilians, they, believed, they, were, fighting, for, and, the, official, opposition, soldiers, who, had, entered, the, war, with, idealistic, viewpoints, of, their, roles, were, quickly, disillusioned, the, structure, of, the, soviet, army, in, comparison, to, the, mujahideen, set, the, soviets, at, a, serious, fighting, disadvantage, while, the, mujahideen, structure, was, based, on, kinship, and, social, cohesion, the, soviet, army, was, bureaucratic, because, of, this, mujahideen, could, significantly, weaken, the, soviet, army, by, the, elimination, of, a, field, commander, or, officer, resistance, forces, were, locally, based, more, ready, to, address, and, mobilize, the, afghan, population, for, support, the, soviet, army, was, centrally, organized, its, regime, structure, emphasized, rank, and, position, paying, less, attention, to, the, well, being, and, effectiveness, of, its, army, the, initial, soviet, plan, relied, on, afghan, troops, support, in, the, mountainous, regions, of, afghanistan, the, majority, of, the, afghan, army, support, crumbled, easily, as, forces, lacked, strong, ideological, support, for, communism, from, the, beginning, the, afghan, army, comprising, 100, 000, men, before, 1978, was, reduced, to, 15, 000, within, the, first, year, of, the, soviet, invasion, of, the, afghan, troops, that, remained, many, were, considered, untrustworthy, to, soviet, troops, afghans, that, deserted, often, took, artillery, with, them, supplying, the, mujahideen, soviet, troops, to, fill, afghan, soldiers, place, were, pushed, into, mountainous, tribal, regions, of, the, east, soviet, tanks, and, modern, warfare, was, ineffective, in, the, rural, mountainous, regions, of, afghanistan, mujahideen, tactics, of, ambush, prevented, soviets, from, developing, successful, counterattacks, in, 1980, the, soviet, army, began, to, rely, on, smaller, and, more, cohesive, units, a, response, to, mirror, mujahideen, tactics, a, decrease, in, unit, size, while, solving, organizational, issues, promoted, field, leaders, to, head, more, violent, and, aggressive, missions, promoting, soviet, desertion, often, small, forces, would, engage, in, rapes, looting, and, general, violence, beyond, what, higher, ranks, ordered, increasing, negative, sanctions, in, undesirable, locations, within, the, soviet, army, serious, drug, and, alcohol, problems, significantly, reduced, the, effectiveness, of, soldiers, resources, became, further, depleted, as, soldiers, pushed, into, the, mountains, drugs, were, rampantly, abused, and, available, often, supplied, by, afghans, supplies, of, heating, fuel, wood, and, food, ran, low, at, bases, soviet, soldiers, often, resorted, to, trading, weapons, and, ammunition, in, exchange, for, drugs, or, food, as, morale, decreased, and, infections, of, hepatitis, and, typhus, spread, soldiers, became, further, disheartened, interviews, with, soviet, soldier, deserters, confirm, that, much, of, soviet, desertion, was, in, response, to, widespread, afghan, opposition, rather, than, personal, aggravation, towards, the, soviet, army, armed, with, modern, artillery, against, ill, equipped, villagers, soviet, soldiers, developed, a, sense, of, guilt, for, the, widespread, killing, of, innocent, civilians, and, their, unfair, artillery, advantage, soviet, deserters, found, support, and, acceptance, within, afghan, villages, after, entering, the, mujahideen, many, deserters, came, to, recognize, the, falsity, of, soviet, propaganda, from, the, beginning, unable, to, legitimize, the, unnecessary, killing, and, mistreatment, of, the, afghan, people, many, deserters, could, not, face, returning, home, and, justifying, their, own, actions, and, the, unnecessary, deaths, of, comrades, upon, deserting, to, the, mujahideen, soldiers, immersed, themselves, into, afghan, culture, hoping, to, rectify, their, position, as, the, enemy, deserters, learned, the, afghan, language, and, converted, to, islam, historically, one, who, was, paid, to, enlist, and, then, deserted, could, be, arrested, under, a, type, of, writ, known, as, arrestando, ipsum, qui, pecuniam, recepit, or, for, arresting, one, who, received, money, during, the, napoleonic, wars, desertion, was, a, massive, drain, on, british, army, resources, despite, the, threat, of, court, martial, and, the, possibility, of, capital, punishment, for, the, crime, many, deserters, were, harboured, by, citizens, who, were, sympathetic, to, them, 306, british, and, commonwealth, soldiers, were, executed, for, desertion, during, world, war, i, records, the, shot, at, dawn, memorial, of, these, 25, were, canadian, 22, irishmen, and, five, new, zealanders, during, the, period, between, august, 1914, and, march, 1920, more, than, 20, 000, servicemen, were, convicted, by, courts, martial, of, offences, which, carried, the, death, sentence, only, 3, 000, of, those, men, were, ordered, to, be, put, to, death, and, of,

deserting, the, army, since, 1989, according, to, the, united, states, uniform, code, of, military, justice, desertion, is, defined, as, a, any, member, of, the, armed, forces, who, b, any, commissioned, officer, of, the, armed, forces, who, after, tender, of, his, resignation, and, before, notice, of, its, acceptance, quits, his, post, or, proper, duties, without, leave, and, with,

committed, in, time, of, war, by, death, or, such, other, punishment, as, a, court, martial, may, direct, but, if, the, desertion, or, attempt, to, desert, occurs, at, any, other, time, by, such, punishment, other, than, death, as, a, court, martial, may, direct, the, desertion, rate, for, american, soldiers, in, the, war, of, 1812, was, 12, 7, according, to, available, service, records, desertion, was, especially, common, in, 1814, when, enlistment, bonuses, were, increased, from, 16, to, 124, inducing, many, men, to, desert, one, unit, and, enlist, in, another, to, get, two, bonuses, during, the, mexican, american, war, the, desertion, rate, in, the, u, s, army, was, 8, 3, 9, 200, out, of, 111, 000, compared, to, 12, 7, during, the, war, of, 1812, and, usual, peacetime, rates, of, about, 14, 8, per, year, many, men, deserted, in, order, to, join, another, u, s, unit, and, get, a, second, enlistment, bonus, others, deserted, because, of, the, miserable, conditions, in, camp, or, in, 1849, 1850, were, using, the, army, to, get, free, transportation, to, california, where, they, deserted, to, join, the, california, gold, rush, several, hundred, deserters, went, over, to, the, mexican, side, nearly, all, were, recent, immigrants, from, europe, with, weak, ties, to, the, united, states, the, most, famous, group, was, the, saint, patrick, s, battalion, about, half, of, whom, were, catholics, from, ireland, anti, catholic, prejudice, reportedly, being, another, reason, for, desertion, the, mexicans, issued, broadsides, and, leaflets, enticing, u, s, soldiers, with, promises, of, money, land, grants, and, officers, commissions, mexican, guerrillas, shadowed, the, u, s, army, and, captured, men, who, took, unauthorized, leave, or, fell, out, of, the, ranks, the, guerrillas, coerced, these, men, to, join, the, mexican, ranks, threatening, to, kill, them, if, they, failed, to, comply, the, generous, promises, proved, illusory, for, most, deserters, who, risked, execution, if, captured, by, u, s, forces, about, fifty, of, the, san, patricios, were, tried, and, hanged, following, their, capture, at, churubusco, in, august, 1847, high, desertion, rates, were, a, major, problem, for, the, mexican, army, depleting, forces, on, the, eve, of, battle, most, of, the, soldiers, were, peasants, who, had, a, loyalty, to, their, village, and, family, but, not, to, the, generals, who, conscripted, them, often, hungry, and, ill, never, well, paid, under, equipped, and, only, partially, trained, the, soldiers, were, held, in, contempt, by, their, officers, and, had, little, reason, to, fight, the, americans, looking, for, their, opportunity, many, slipped, away, from, camp, to, find, their, way, back, to, their, home, village, during, the, american, civil, war, both, the, union, and, confederacy, had, a, desertion, problem, from, its, 2, 5, million, or, so, men, the, union, army, saw, about, 200, 000, desertions, over, 100, 000, deserted, the, confederate, army, which, was, less, than, a, million, men, and, possibly, as, little, as, a, third, the, size, of, the, union, army, new, york, suffered, 44, 913, desertions, by, the, war, s, end, and, pennsylvania, recorded, 24, 050, with, ohio, reporting, desertions, at, 18, 354, about, 1, out, of, 3, deserters, returned, to, their, regiments, either, voluntarily, or, after, being, arrested, and, being, sent, back, many, of, the, desertions, were, by, professional, bounty, men, men, who, would, enlist, to, collect, the, often, large, cash, bonuses, and, then, desert, at, the, earliest, opportunity, to, repeat, another, enlistment, elsewhere, if, caught, they, would, face, execution, otherwise, it, could, prove, a, very, lucrative, criminal, enterprise, the, total, number, of, confederate, deserters, was, officially, 103, 400, desertion, was, a, major, factor, for, the, confederacy, in, the, last, two, years, of, the, war, according, to, mark, a, weitz, confederate, soldiers, fought, to, defend, their, families, not, a, nation, he, argues, that, a, hegemonic, planter, class, brought, georgia, into, the, war, with, little, support, from, non, slaveholders, p, 12, and, the, ambivalence, of, non, slaveholders, toward, secession, he, maintains, was, the, key, to, understanding, desertion, the, privations, of, the, home, front, and, camp, life, combined, with, the, terror, of, battle, undermined, the, weak, attachment, of, southern, soldiers, to, the, confederacy, for, georgian, troops, sherman, s, march, through, their, home, counties, triggered, the, most, desertions, adoption, of, a, localist, identity, caused, soldiers, to, desert, as, well, when, soldiers, implemented, a, local, identity, they, neglected, to, think, of, themselves, as, southerners, fighting, a, southern, cause, when, they, replaced, their, southern, identity, with, their, previous, local, identity, they, lost, their, motive, to, fight, and,
