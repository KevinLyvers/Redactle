patterns, of, peace, making, raiding, and, trading, among, the, navajo, spaniards, apache, comanche, and, hopi, continued, until, the, arrival, of, americans, in, 1846, the, navajos, encountered, the,

from, each, other, however, the, spanish, mexican, navajo, pattern, of, raids, and, expeditions, continued, over, 400, new, mexican, militia, conducted, a, campaign, against, the, navajo, against, the, wishes, of, the, territorial, governor, in, 1860, 61, they, killed, navajo, warriors, captured, women, and, children, for, slaves, and, destroyed, crops, and, dwellings, the, navajos, call, this, period, naahondzood, the, fearing, time, in, 1861, brigadier, general, james, h, carleton, commander, of, the, federal, district, of, new, mexico, initiated, a, series, of, military, actions, against, the, navajos, and, apaches, colonel, kit, carson, was, at, the, new, fort, wingate, with, army, troops, and, volunteer, new, mexico, militia, carleton, ordered, carson, to, kill, mescalero, apache, men, and, destroy, any, mescalero, property, he, could, find, carleton, believed, these, harsh, tactics, would, bring, any, indian, tribe, under, control, the, mescalero, surrendered, and, were, sent, to, the, new, reservation, called, bosque, redondo, in, 1863, carleton, ordered, carson, to, use, the, same, tactics, on, the, navajo, carson, and, his, force, swept, through, navajo, land, killing, navajos, and, destroying, crops, and, dwellings, fouling, wells, and, capturing, livestock, facing, starvation, and, death, navajo, groups, came, to, fort, defiance, for, relief, on, july, 20, 1863, the, first, of, many, groups, departed, to, join, the, mescalero, at, bosque, redondo, other, groups, continued, to, come, in, through, 1864, however, not, all, the, navajos, came, in, or, were, found, some, lived, near, the, san, juan, river, some, beyond, the, hopi, villages, and, others, lived, with, apache, bands, beginning, in, the, spring, of, 1864, the, army, forced, around, 9, 000, navajo, men, women, and, children, to, walk, over, 300, miles, 480, km, to, fort, sumner, new, mexico, for, internment, at, bosque, redondo, the, internment, was, disastrous, for, the, navajo, as, the, government, failed, to, provide, enough, water, wood, provisions, and, livestock, for, the, 4, 000, to, 5, 000, people, large, scale, crop, failure, and, disease, were, also, endemic, during, this, time, as, were, raids, by, other, tribes, and, white, civilians, some, navajos, froze, in, the, winter, because, they, could, make, only, poor, shelters, from, the, few, materials, they, were, given, this, period, is, known, among, the, navajos, as, the, fearing, time, in, addition, a, small, group, of, mescalero, apache, longtime, enemies, of, the, navajos, had, been, relocated, to, the, area, which, resulted, in, conflicts, in, 1868, the, treaty, of, bosque, redondo, was, negotiated, between, navajo, leaders, and, the, federal, government, allowing, the, surviving, navajos, to, return, to, a, reservation, on, a, portion, of, their, former, homeland, the, united, states, military, continued, to, maintain, forts, on, the, navajo, reservation, in, the, years, after, the, long, walk, from, 1873, to, 1895, the, military, employed, navajos, as, indian, scouts, at, fort, wingate, to, help, their, regular, units, during, this, period, chief, manuelito, founded, the, navajo, tribal, police, it, operated, from, 1872, to, 1875, as, an, anti, raid, task, force, working, to, maintain, the, peaceful, terms, of, the, 1868, navajo, treaty, by, treaty, the, navajos, were, allowed, to, leave, the, reservation, for, trade, with, permission, from, the, military, or, local, indian, agent, eventually, the, arrangement, led, to, a, gradual, end, in, navajo, raids, as, the, tribe, was, able, to, increase, their, livestock, and, crops, also, the, tribe, gained, an, increase, in, the, size, of, the, navajo, reservation, from, 3, 5, million, acres, 14, 000, km, 2, 5, 500, sq, mi, to, 16, million, acres, 65, 000, km, 2, 25, 000, sq, mi, as, it, stands, today, but, economic, conflicts, with, non, navajos, continued, for, many, years, as, civilians, and, companies, exploited, resources, assigned, to, the, navajo, the, us, government, made, leases, for, livestock, grazing, took, land, for, railroad, development, and, permitted, mining, on, navajo, land, without, consulting, the, tribe, in, 1883, lt, parker, accompanied, by, 10, enlisted, men, and, two, scouts, went, up, the, san, juan, river, to, separate, the, navajos, and, citizens, who, had, encroached, on, navajo, land, in, the, same, year, lt, lockett, with, the, aid, of, 42, enlisted, soldiers, was, joined, by, lt, holomon, at, navajo, springs, evidently, citizens, of, the, surnames, houck, and, or, owens, had, murdered, a, navajo, chief, s, son, and, 100, armed, navajo, warriors, were, looking, for, them, in, 1887, citizens, palmer, lockhart, and, king, fabricated, a, charge, of, horse, stealing, and, randomly, attacked, a, dwelling, on, the, reservation, two, navajo, men, and, all, three, whites, died, as, a, result, but, a, woman, and, a, child, survived, capt, kerr, with, two, navajo, scouts, examined, the, ground, and, then, met, with, several, hundred, navajos, at, houcks, tank, rancher, bennett, whose, horse, was, allegedly, stolen, told, kerr, that, his, horses, were, stolen, by, the, three, whites, to, catch, a, horse, thief, in, the, same, year, lt, scott, went, to, the, san, juan, river, with, two, scouts, and, 21, enlisted, men, the, navajos, believed, scott, was, there, to, drive, off, the, whites, who, had, settled, on, the, reservation, and, had, fenced, off, the, river, from, the, navajo, scott, found, evidence, of, many, non, navajo, ranches, only, three, were, active, and, the, owners, wanted, payment, for, their, improvements, before, leaving, scott, ejected, them, in, 1890, a, local, rancher, refused, to, pay, the, navajos, a, fine, for, livestock, the, navajos, tried, to, collect, it, and, whites, in, southern, colorado, and, utah, claimed, that, 9, 000, of, the, navajos, were, on, a, warpath, a, small, military, detachment, out, of, fort, wingate, restored, white, citizens, to, order, in, 1913, an, indian, agent, ordered, a, navajo, and, his, three, wives, to, come, in, and, then, arrested, them, for, having, a, plural, marriage, a, small, group, of, navajos, used, force, to, free, the, women, and, retreated, to, beautiful, mountain, with, 30, or, 40, sympathizers, they, refused, to, surrender, to, the, agent, and, local, law, enforcement, and, military, refused, the, agent, s, request, for, an, armed, engagement, general, scott, arrived, and, with, the, help, of, henry, chee, dodge, a, leader, among, the, navajo, defused, the, situation, during, the, time, on, the, reservation, the, navajo, tribe, was, forced, to, assimilate, into, white, society, navajo, children, were, sent, to, boarding, schools, within, the, reservation, and, off, the, reservation, the, first, bureau, of, indian, affairs, bia, school, opened, at, fort, defiance, in, 1870, and, led, the, way, for, eight, others, to, be, established, many, older, navajos, were, against, this, education, and, would, hide, their, children, to, keep, them, from, being, taken, once, the, children, arrived, at, the, boarding, school, their, lives, changed, dramatically, european, americans, taught, the, classes, under, an, english, only, curriculum, and, punished, any, student, caught, speaking, navajo, the, children, were, under, militaristic, discipline, run, by, the, sil, o, in, multiple, interviews, subjects, recalled, being, captured, and, disciplined, by, the, sil, o, if, they, tried, to, run, away, other, conditions, included, inadequate, food, overcrowding, required, manual, labor, in, kitchens, fields, and, boiler, rooms, and, military, style, uniforms, and, haircuts, change, did, not, occur, in, these, boarding, schools, until, after, the, meriam, report, was, published, in, 1929, by, the, secretary, of, interior, hubert, work, this, report, discussed, indian, boarding, schools, as, being, inadequate, in, terms, of, diet, medical, services, dormitory, overcrowding, undereducated, teachers, restrictive, discipline, and, manual, labor, by, the, students, to, keep, the, school, running, this, report, was, the, precursor, to, education, reforms, initiated, under, president, franklin, d, roosevelt, under, which, two, new, schools, were, built, on, the, navajo, reservation, but, rough, rock, day, school, was, run, in, the, same, militaristic, style, as, fort, defiance, and, did, not, implement, educational, reforms, navajo, accounts, of, the, evangelical, missionary, school, portray, it, as, having, a, family, like, atmosphere, with, home, cooked, meals, new, or, gently, used, clothing, humane, treatment, and, a, navajo, based, curriculum, educators, found, the, evangelical, missionary, school, curriculum, to, be, much, more, beneficial, for, navajo, children, in, 1937, boston, heiress, mary, cabot, wheelright, and, navajo, singer, and, medicine, man, hastiin, klah, founded, the, wheelwright, museum, of, the, american, indian, in, santa, fe, it, is, a, repository, for, sound, recordings, manuscripts, paintings, and, sandpainting, tapestries, of, the, navajos, it, also, featured, exhibits, to, express, the, beauty, dignity, and, logic, of, the, navajo, religion, when, klah, met, cabot, in, 1921, he, witnessed, decades, of, efforts, by, the, us, government, and, missionaries, to, assimilate, the, navajos, into, mainstream, society, the, museum, was, founded, to, preserve, the, religion, and, traditions, of, the, navajo, which, klah, was, sure, would, otherwise, soon, be, lost, forever, the, result, of, these, boarding, schools, led, to, much, language, loss, within, the, navajo, nation, after, the, second, world, war, the, meriam, report, funded, more, children, to, attend, these, schools, with, six, times, as, many, children, attending, boarding, school, than, before, the, war, english, as, the, primary, language, spoken, at, these, schools, as, well, as, the, local, towns, surrounding, the, navajo, reservations, contributed, to, residents, becoming, bilingual, however, navajo, was, still, the, primary, language, spoken, at, home, the, navajo, livestock, reduction, was, imposed, upon, the, navajo, nation, by, the, federal, government, starting, in, 1933, during, the, great, depression, under, various, forms, it, continued, into, the, 1950s, worried, about, large, herds, in, the, arid, climate, at, a, time, when, the, dust, bowl, was, endangering, the, great, plains, the, government, decided, that, the, land, of, the, navajo, nation, could, support, only, a, fixed, number, of, sheep, goats, cattle, and, horses, the, federal, government, believed, that, land, erosion, was, worsening, in, the, area, and, the, only, solution, was, to, reduce, the, number, of, livestock, in, 1933, john, collier, was, appointed, commissioner, of, the, bia, in, many, ways, he, worked, to, reform, government, relations, with, the, native, american, tribes, but, the, reduction, program, was, devastating, for, the, navajo, for, whom, their, livestock, was, so, important, the, government, set, land, capacity, in, terms, of, sheep, units, in, 1930, the, navajos, grazed, 1, 100, 000, mature, sheep, units, these, sheep, provided, half, the, cash, income, for, the, individual, navajo, collier, s, solution, was, to, first, launch, a, voluntary, reduction, program, which, was, made, mandatory, two, years, later, in, 1935, the, government, paid, for, part, of, the, value, of, each, animal, but, it, did, nothing, to, compensate, for, the, loss, of, future, yearly, income, for, so, many, navajo, in, the, matrilineal, and, matrilocal, world, of, the, navajo, women, were, especially, hurt, as, many, lost, their, only, source, of, income, with, the, reduction, of, livestock, herds, the, navajos, did, not, understand, why, their, centuries, old, practices, of, raising, livestock, should, change, they, were, united, in, opposition, but, they, were, unable, to, stop, it, historian, brian, dippie, notes, that, the, indian, rights, association, denounced, collier, as, a, dictator, and, accused, him, of, a, near, reign, of, terror, on, the, navajo, reservation, dippie, adds, that, he, became, an, object, of, burning, hatred, among, the, very, people, whose, problems, so, preoccupied, him, the, long, term, result, was, strong, navajo, opposition, to, collier, s, indian, new, deal, many, navajo, young, people, moved, to, cities, to, work, in, urban, factories, during, world, war, ii, many, navajo, men, volunteered, for, military, service, in, keeping, with, their, warrior, culture, and, they, served, in, integrated, units, the, war, department, in, 1940, rejected, a, proposal, by, the, bia, that, segregated, units, be, created, for, the, indians, the, navajos, gained, firsthand, experience, with, how, they, could, assimilate, into, the, modern, world, and, many, did, not, return, to, the, overcrowded, reservation, which, had, few, jobs, four, hundred, navajo, code, talkers, played, a, famous, role, during, world, war, ii, by, relaying, radio, messages, using, their, own, language, the, japanese, were, unable, to, understand, or, decode, it, in, the, 1940s, large, quantities, of, uranium, were, discovered, in, navajo, land, from, then, into, the, early, 21st, century, the, u, s, allowed, mining, without, sufficient, environmental, protection, for, workers, waterways, and, land, the, navajos, have, claimed, high, rates, of, death, and, illness, from, lung, disease, and, cancer, resulting, from, environmental, contamination, since, the, 1970s, legislation, has, helped, to, regulate, the, industry, and, reduce, the, toll, the, navajo, code, talkers, played, a, significant, role, in, usmc, history, using, their, own, language, they, utilized, a, military, code, for, example, the, navajo, word, turtle, represented, a, tank, in, 1942, marine, staff, officers, composed, several, combat, simulations, and, the, navajo, translated, it, and, transmitted, it, in, their, dialect, to, another, navajo, on, the, other, line, this, navajo, then, translated, it, back, into, english, faster, than, any, other, cryptographic, facility, which, demonstrated, their, efficacy, as, a, result, general, vogel, recommended, their, recruitment, into, the, usmc, code, talker, program, each, navajo, went, through, a, basic, boot, camp, at, marine, corps, recruit, depot, san, diego, before, being, assigned, to, field, signal, battalion, training, at, camp, pendleton, once, the, code, talkers, completed, training, in, the, states, they, were, sent, to, the, pacific, for, assignment, to, the, marine, combat, divisions, with, that, said, there, was, never, a, crack, in, the, navajo, language, it, was, never, deciphered, it, is, known, that, many, more, navajos, volunteered, to, become, code, talkers, than, could, be, accepted, however, an, undetermined, number, of, other, navajos, served, as, marines, in, the, war, but, not, as, code, talkers, these, achievements, of, the, navajo, code, talkers, have, resulted, in, an, honorable, chapter, in, usmc, history, their, patriotism, and, honor, inevitably, earned, them, the, respect, of, all, americans, the, name, navajo, comes, from, the, late, 18th, century, via, the, spanish, apaches, de, navaj, apaches, of, navaj, which, was, derived, from, the, tewa, navah, farm, fields, adjoining, a, valley, the, navajos, call, themselves, din, like, other, apacheans, the, navajos, were, semi, nomadic, from, the, 16th, through, the, 20th, centuries, their, extended, kinship, groups, had, seasonal, dwelling, areas, to, accommodate, livestock, agriculture, and, gathering, practices, as, part, of, their, traditional, economy, navajo, groups, may, have, formed, trading, or, raiding, parties, traveling, relatively, long, distances, there, is, a, system, of, clans, or, k, that, defines, relationships, between, individuals, and, families, the, clan, system, is, exogamous, people, can, only, marry, or, date, partners, outside, their, own, clans, which, for, this, purpose, include, the, clans, of, their, four, grandparents, some, navajos, favor, their, children, to, marry, into, their, father, s, clan, while, clans, are, associated, with, a, geographical, area, the, area, is, not, for, the, exclusive, use, of, any, one, clan, members, of, a, clan, may, live, hundreds, of, miles, apart, but, still, have, a, clan, bond, xix, xxi, historically, the, structure, of, the, navajo, society, is, largely, a, matrilineal, system, in, which, the, family, of, the, women, owned, livestock, dwellings, planting, areas, and, livestock, grazing, areas, once, married, a, navajo, man, would, follow, a, matrilocal, residence, and, live, with, his, bride, in, her, dwelling, and, near, her, mother, s, family, daughters, or, if, necessary, other, female, relatives, were, traditionally, the, ones, who, received, the, generational, property, inheritance, in, cases, of, marital, separation, women, would, maintain, the, property, and, children, children, are, born, to, and, belong, to, the, mother, s, clan, and, are, born, for, the, father, s, clan, the, mother, s, eldest, brother, has, a, strong, role, in, her, children, s, lives, as, adults, men, represent, their, mother, s, clan, in, tribal, politics, traditionally, there, are, four, clans, said, to, be, the, original, ones, given, to, the, navajo, from, asdz, n, dleeh, or, changing, woman, today, there, are, more, than, 100, clans, some, of, which, include, other, native, nations, such, as, naasht, zh, din, e, referring, to, the, zuni, of, the, naashgal, din, referring, to, the, mescalero, apache, men, and, women, are, seen, as,
