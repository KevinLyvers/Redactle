rhetoric, r, t, r, k, is, the, art, of, persuasion, it, is, one, of, the, three, ancient, arts, of, discourse, trivium, along, with, grammar, and, logic, dialectic, as, an, academic, discipline, within, the, humanities, rhetoric, aims, to, study, the, techniques, that, speakers, or, writers, use, to, inform, persuade, and, motivate, their, audiences, rhetoric, also, provides, heuristics, for, understanding, discovering, and, developing, arguments, for, particular, situations, aristotle, defined, rhetoric, as, the, faculty, of, observing, in, any, given, case, the, available, means, of, persuasion, and, since, mastery, of, the, art, was, necessary, for, victory, in, a, case, at, law, for, passage, of, proposals, in, the, assembly, or, for, fame, as, a, speaker, in, civic, ceremonies, he, called, it, a, combination, of, the, science, of, logic, and, of, the, ethical, branch, of, politics, aristotle, also, identified, three, persuasive, audience, appeals, logos, pathos, and, ethos, the, five, canons, of, rhetoric, or, phases, of, developing, a, persuasive, speech, were, first, codified, in, classical, rome, invention, arrangement, style, memory, and, delivery, from, ancient, greece, to, the, late, 19th, century, rhetoric, played, a, central, role, in, western, education, in, training, orators, lawyers, counsellors, historians, statesmen, and, poets, scholars, have, debated, the, scope, of, rhetoric, since, ancient, times, although, some, have, limited, rhetoric, to, the, specific, realm, of, political, discourse, to, many, modern, scholars, it, encompasses, every, aspect, of, culture, contemporary, studies, of, rhetoric, address, a, much, more, diverse, range, of, domains, than, was, the, case, in, ancient, times, while, classical, rhetoric, trained, speakers, to, be, effective, persuaders, in, public, forums, and, in, institutions, such, as, courtrooms, and, assemblies, contemporary, rhetoric, investigates, human, discourse, writ, large, rhetoricians, have, studied, the, discourses, of, a, wide, variety, of, domains, including, the, natural, and, social, sciences, fine, art, religion, journalism, digital, media, fiction, history, cartography, and, architecture, along, with, the, more, traditional, domains, of, politics, and, the, law, because, the, ancient, greeks, valued, public, political, participation, rhetoric, emerged, as, an, important, curriculum, for, those, desiring, to, influence, politics, rhetoric, is, still, associated, with, its, political, origins, however, even, the, original, instructors, of, western, speech, the, sophists, disputed, this, limited, view, of, rhetoric, according, to, sophists, like, gorgias, a, successful, rhetorician, could, speak, convincingly, on, a, topic, in, any, field, regardless, of, his, experience, in, that, field, this, suggested, rhetoric, could, be, a, means, of, communicating, any, expertise, not, just, politics, in, his, encomium, to, helen, gorgias, even, applied, rhetoric, to, fiction, by, seeking, for, his, amusement, to, prove, the, blamelessness, of, the, mythical, helen, of, troy, in, starting, the, trojan, war, plato, defined, the, scope, of, rhetoric, according, to, his, negative, opinions, of, the, art, he, criticized, the, sophists, for, using, rhetoric, to, deceive, rather, than, to, discover, truth, in, gorgias, one, of, his, socratic, dialogues, plato, defines, rhetoric, as, the, persuasion, of, ignorant, masses, within, the, courts, and, assemblies, rhetoric, in, plato, s, opinion, is, merely, a, form, of, flattery, and, functions, similarly, to, culinary, arts, which, mask, the, undesirability, of, unhealthy, food, by, making, it, taste, good, plato, considered, any, speech, of, lengthy, prose, aimed, at, flattery, as, within, the, scope, of, rhetoric, some, scholars, however, contest, the, idea, that, plato, despised, rhetoric, and, instead, view, his, dialogues, as, a, dramatization, of, complex, rhetorical, principles, aristotle, both, redeemed, rhetoric, from, his, teacher, and, narrowed, its, focus, by, defining, three, genres, of, rhetoric, deliberative, forensic, or, judicial, and, epideictic, yet, even, as, he, provided, order, to, existing, rhetorical, theories, aristotle, generalized, the, definition, of, rhetoric, to, be, the, ability, to, identify, the, appropriate, means, of, persuasion, in, a, given, situation, based, upon, the, art, of, rhetoric, techn, this, made, rhetoric, applicable, to, all, fields, not, just, politics, aristotle, viewed, the, enthymeme, based, upon, logic, especially, based, upon, the, syllogism, as, the, basis, of, rhetoric, aristotle, also, outlined, generic, constraints, that, focused, the, rhetorical, art, squarely, within, the, domain, of, public, political, practice, he, restricted, rhetoric, to, the, domain, of, the, contingent, or, probable, those, matters, that, admit, multiple, legitimate, opinions, or, arguments, since, the, time, of, aristotle, logic, has, changed, for, example, modal, logic, has, undergone, a, major, development, that, also, modifies, rhetoric, the, contemporary, neo, aristotelian, and, neo, sophistic, positions, on, rhetoric, mirror, the, division, between, the, sophists, and, aristotle, neo, aristotelians, generally, study, rhetoric, as, political, discourse, while, the, neo, sophistic, view, contends, that, rhetoric, cannot, be, so, limited, rhetorical, scholar, michael, leff, characterizes, the, conflict, between, these, positions, as, viewing, rhetoric, as, a, thing, contained, versus, a, container, the, neo, aristotelian, view, threatens, the, study, of, rhetoric, by, restraining, it, to, such, a, limited, field, ignoring, many, critical, applications, of, rhetorical, theory, criticism, and, practice, simultaneously, the, neo, sophists, threaten, to, expand, rhetoric, beyond, a, point, of, coherent, theoretical, value, in, more, recent, years, people, studying, rhetoric, have, tended, to, enlarge, its, object, domain, beyond, speech, kenneth, burke, asserted, humans, use, rhetoric, to, resolve, conflicts, by, identifying, shared, characteristics, and, interests, in, symbols, people, engage, in, identification, either, to, assign, themselves, or, another, to, a, group, this, definition, of, rhetoric, as, identification, broadens, the, scope, from, strategic, and, overt, political, persuasion, to, the, more, implicit, tactics, of, identification, found, in, an, immense, range, of, sources, among, the, many, scholars, who, have, since, pursued, burke, s, line, of, thought, james, boyd, white, sees, rhetoric, as, a, broader, domain, of, social, experience, in, his, notion, of, constitutive, rhetoric, influenced, by, theories, of, social, construction, white, argues, that, culture, is, reconstituted, through, language, just, as, language, influences, people, people, influence, language, language, is, socially, constructed, and, depends, on, the, meanings, people, attach, to, it, because, language, is, not, rigid, and, changes, depending, on, the, situation, the, very, usage, of, language, is, rhetorical, an, author, white, would, say, is, always, trying, to, construct, a, new, world, and, persuading, his, or, her, readers, to, share, that, world, within, the, text, people, engage, in, rhetoric, any, time, they, speak, or, produce, meaning, even, in, the, field, of, science, via, practices, which, were, once, viewed, as, being, merely, the, objective, testing, and, reporting, of, knowledge, scientists, persuade, their, audience, to, accept, their, findings, by, sufficiently, demonstrating, that, their, study, or, experiment, was, conducted, reliably, and, resulted, in, sufficient, evidence, to, support, their, conclusions, the, vast, scope, of, rhetoric, is, difficult, to, define, political, discourse, remains, the, paradigmatic, example, for, studying, and, theorizing, specific, techniques, and, conceptions, of, persuasion, or, rhetoric, throughout, european, history, rhetoric, meant, persuasion, in, public, and, political, settings, such, as, assemblies, and, courts, because, of, its, associations, with, democratic, institutions, rhetoric, is, commonly, said, to, flourish, in, open, and, democratic, societies, with, rights, of, free, speech, free, assembly, and, political, enfranchisement, for, some, portion, of, the, population, those, who, classify, rhetoric, as, a, civic, art, believe, that, rhetoric, has, the, power, to, shape, communities, form, the, character, of, citizens, and, greatly, affect, civic, life, rhetoric, was, viewed, as, a, civic, art, by, several, of, the, ancient, philosophers, aristotle, and, isocrates, were, two, of, the, first, to, see, rhetoric, in, this, light, in, antidosis, isocrates, states, we, have, come, together, and, founded, cities, and, made, laws, and, invented, arts, and, generally, speaking, there, is, no, institution, devised, by, man, which, the, power, of, speech, has, not, helped, us, to, establish, with, this, statement, he, argues, that, rhetoric, is, a, fundamental, part, of, civic, life, in, every, society, and, that, it, has, been, necessary, in, the, foundation, of, all, aspects, of, society, he, further, argues, in, against, the, sophists, that, rhetoric, although, it, cannot, be, taught, to, just, anyone, is, capable, of, shaping, the, character, of, man, he, writes, i, do, think, that, the, study, of, political, discourse, can, help, more, than, any, other, thing, to, stimulate, and, form, such, qualities, of, character, aristotle, writing, several, years, after, isocrates, supported, many, of, his, arguments, and, argued, for, rhetoric, as, a, civic, art, in, the, words, of, aristotle, in, the, rhetoric, rhetoric, is, the, faculty, of, observing, in, any, given, case, the, available, means, of, persuasion, according, to, aristotle, this, art, of, persuasion, could, be, used, in, public, settings, in, three, different, ways, a, member, of, the, assembly, decides, about, future, events, a, juryman, about, past, events, while, those, who, merely, decide, on, the, orator, s, skill, are, observers, from, this, it, follows, that, there, are, three, divisions, of, oratory, 1, political, 2, forensic, and, 3, the, ceremonial, oratory, of, display, eugene, garver, in, his, critique, of, aristotle, s, rhetoric, confirms, that, aristotle, viewed, rhetoric, as, a, civic, art, garver, writes, rhetoric, articulates, a, civic, art, of, rhetoric, combining, the, almost, incompatible, properties, of, techne, and, appropriateness, to, citizens, each, of, aristotle, s, divisions, plays, a, role, in, civic, life, and, can, be, used, in, a, different, way, to, affect, the, polis, because, rhetoric, is, a, public, art, capable, of, shaping, opinion, some, of, the, ancients, including, plato, found, fault, in, it, they, claimed, that, while, it, could, be, used, to, improve, civic, life, it, could, be, used, just, as, easily, to, deceive, or, manipulate, the, masses, were, incapable, of, analyzing, or, deciding, anything, on, their, own, and, would, therefore, be, swayed, by, the, most, persuasive, speeches, thus, civic, life, could, be, controlled, by, whoever, could, deliver, the, best, speech, plato, explores, the, problematic, moral, status, of, rhetoric, twice, in, gorgias, and, in, the, phaedrus, a, dialogue, best, known, for, its, commentary, on, love, more, trusting, in, the, power, of, rhetoric, to, support, a, republic, the, roman, orator, cicero, argued, that, art, required, something, more, than, eloquence, a, good, orator, needed, also, to, be, a, good, man, a, person, enlightened, on, a, variety, of, civic, topics, he, describes, the, proper, training, of, the, orator, in, his, major, text, on, rhetoric, de, oratore, which, he, modeled, on, plato, s, dialogues, modern, works, continue, to, support, the, claims, of, the, ancients, that, rhetoric, is, an, art, capable, of, influencing, civic, life, in, political, style, robert, hariman, claims, that, questions, of, freedom, equality, and, justice, often, are, raised, and, addressed, through, performances, ranging, from, debates, to, demonstrations, without, loss, of, moral, content, james, boyd, white, argues, that, rhetoric, is, capable, not, only, of, addressing, issues, of, political, interest, but, that, it, can, influence, culture, as, a, whole, in, his, book, when, words, lose, their, meaning, he, argues, that, words, of, persuasion, and, identification, define, community, and, civic, life, he, states, that, words, produce, the, methods, by, which, culture, is, maintained, criticized, and, transformed, rhetoric, remains, relevant, as, a, civic, art, in, speeches, as, well, as, in, non, verbal, forms, rhetoric, continues, to, be, used, as, a, tool, to, influence, communities, from, local, to, national, levels, political, parties, employ, manipulative, rhetoric, to, advance, their, party, line, goals, and, lobbyist, agendas, they, use, it, to, portray, themselves, as, champions, of, compassion, freedom, and, culture, all, while, implementing, policies, that, appear, to, contradict, these, claims, it, serves, as, a, form, of, political, propaganda, presented, to, sway, and, maintain, public, opinion, in, their, favor, and, garner, a, positive, image, potentially, at, the, expense, of, suppressing, dissent, or, criticism, an, example, of, this, is, the, government, s, actions, in, freezing, bank, accounts, and, regulating, internet, speech, ostensibly, to, protect, the, vulnerable, and, preserve, freedom, of, expression, despite, contradicting, values, and, rights, the, origins, of, the, rhetoric, language, begin, in, ancient, greece, it, originally, began, by, a, group, named, the, sophists, who, wanted, to, teach, the, athenians, to, speak, persuasively, in, order, to, be, able, to, navigate, themselves, in, the, court, and, senate, what, inspired, this, form, of, persuasive, speech, came, about, through, a, new, form, of, government, known, as, democracy, that, was, being, experimented, with, consequently, people, began, to, fear, that, persuasive, speech, would, overpower, truth, aristotle, however, believed, that, this, technique, was, an, art, and, that, persuasive, speech, could, have, truth, and, logic, embedded, within, it, in, the, end, rhetoric, speech, still, remained, popular, and, was, used, by, many, scholars, and, philosophers, the, study, of, rhetoric, trains, students, to, speak, and, or, write, effectively, and, to, critically, understand, and, analyze, discourse, it, is, concerned, with, how, people, use, symbols, especially, language, to, reach, agreement, that, permits, coordinated, effort, rhetoric, as, a, course, of, study, has, evolved, since, its, ancient, beginnings, and, has, adapted, to, the, particular, exigencies, of, various, times, venues, and, applications, ranging, from, architecture, to, literature, although, the, curriculum, has, transformed, in, a, number, of, ways, it, has, generally, emphasized, the, study, of, principles, and, rules, of, composition, as, a, means, for, moving, audiences, rhetoric, began, as, a, civic, art, in, ancient, greece, where, students, were, trained, to, develop, tactics, of, oratorical, persuasion, especially, in, legal, disputes, rhetoric, originated, in, a, school, of, pre, socratic, philosophers, known, as, the, sophists, c, 600, bce, demosthenes, and, lysias, emerged, as, major, orators, during, this, period, and, isocrates, and, gorgias, as, prominent, teachers, modern, teachings, continue, to, reference, these, rhetoricians, and, their, work, in, discussions, of, classical, rhetoric, and, persuasion, rhetoric, was, taught, in, universities, during, the, middle, ages, as, one, of, the, three, original, liberal, arts, or, trivium, along, with, logic, and, grammar, during, the, medieval, period, political, rhetoric, declined, as, republican, oratory, died, out, and, the, emperors, of, rome, garnered, increasing, authority, with, the, rise, of, european, monarchs, rhetoric, shifted, into, courtly, and, religious, applications, augustine, exerted, strong, influence, on, christian, rhetoric, in, the, middle, ages, advocating, the, use, of, rhetoric, to, lead, audiences, to, truth, and, understanding, especially, in, the, church, the, study, of, liberal, arts, he, believed, contributed, to, rhetorical, study, in, the, case, of, a, keen, and, ardent, nature, fine, words, will, come, more, readily, through, reading, and, hearing, the, eloquent, than, by, pursuing, the, rules, of, rhetoric, poetry, and, letter, writing, became, central, to, rhetorical, study, during, the, middle, ages, 129, 47, after, the, fall, of, the, roman, republic, poetry, became, a, tool, for, rhetorical, training, since, there, were, fewer, opportunities, for, political, speech, 131, letter, writing, was, the, primary, way, business, was, conducted, both, in, state, and, church, so, it, became, an, important, aspect, of, rhetorical, education, rhetorical, education, became, more, restrained, as, style, and, substance, separated, in, 16th, century, france, and, attention, turned, to, the, scientific, method, influential, scholars, like, peter, ramus, argued, that, the, processes, of, invention, and, arrangement, should, be, elevated, to, the, domain, of, philosophy, while, rhetorical, instruction, should, be, chiefly, concerned, with, the, use, of, figures, and, other, forms, of, the, ornamentation, of, language, scholars, such, as, francis, bacon, developed, the, study, of, scientific, rhetoric, which, rejected, the, elaborate, style, characteristic, of, classical, oration, this, plain, language, carried, over, to, john, locke, s, teaching, which, emphasized, concrete, knowledge, and, steered, away, from, ornamentation, in, speech, further, alienating, rhetorical, instruction, which, was, identified, wholly, with, such, ornamentation, from, the, pursuit, of, knowledge, in, the, 18th, century, rhetoric, assumed, a, more, social, role, leading, to, the, creation, of, new, education, systems, predominantly, in, england, elocution, schools, in, which, girls, and, women, analyzed, classic, literature, most, notably, the, works, of, william, shakespeare, and, discussed, pronunciation, tactics, the, study, of, rhetoric, underwent, a, revival, with, the, rise, of, democratic, institutions, during, the, late, 18th, and, early, 19th, centuries, hugh, blair, was, a, key, early, leader, of, this, movement, in, his, most, famous, work, lectures, on, rhetoric, and, belles, lettres, he, advocates, rhetorical, study, for, common, citizens, as, a, resource, for, social, success, many, american, colleges, and, secondary, schools, used, blair, s, text, throughout, the, 19th, century, to, train, students, of, rhetoric, political, rhetoric, also, underwent, renewal, in, the, wake, of, the, u, s, and, french, revolutions, the, rhetorical, studies, of, ancient, greece, and, rome, were, resurrected, as, speakers, and, teachers, looked, to, cicero, and, others, to, inspire, defenses, of, the, new, republics, leading, rhetorical, theorists, included, john, quincy, adams, of, harvard, who, advocated, the, democratic, advancement, of, rhetorical, art, harvard, s, founding, of, the, boylston, professorship, of, rhetoric, and, oratory, sparked, the, growth, of, the, study, of, rhetoric, in, colleges, across, the, united, states, harvard, s, rhetoric, program, drew, inspiration, from, literary, sources, to, guide, organization, and, style, and, studies, the, rhetoric, used, in, political, communication, to, illustrate, how, political, figures, persuade, audiences, william, g, allen, became, the, first, american, college, professor, of, rhetoric, at, new, york, central, college, 1850, 1853, debate, clubs, and, lyceums, also, developed, as, forums, in, which, common, citizens, could, hear, speakers, and, sharpen, debate, skills, the, american, lyceum, in, particular, was, seen, as, both, an, educational, and, social, institution, featuring, group, discussions, and, guest, lecturers, these, programs, cultivated, democratic, values, and, promoted, active, participation, in, political, analysis, throughout, the, 20th, century, rhetoric, developed, as, a, concentrated, field, of, study, with, the, establishment, of, rhetorical, courses, in, high, schools, and, universities, courses, such, as, public, speaking, and, speech, analysis, apply, fundamental, greek, theories, such, as, the, modes, of, persuasion, ethos, pathos, and, logos, and, trace, rhetorical, development, through, history, rhetoric, earned, a, more, esteemed, reputation, as, a, field, of, study, with, the, emergence, of, communication, studies, departments, and, of, rhetoric, and, composition, programs, within, english, departments, in, universities, and, in, conjunction, with, the, linguistic, turn, in, western, philosophy, rhetorical, study, has, broadened, in, scope, and, is, especially, used, by, the, fields, of, marketing, politics, and, literature, another, area, of, rhetoric, is, the, study, of, cultural, rhetorics, which, is, the, communication, that, occurs, between, cultures, and, the, study, of, the, way, members, of, a, culture, communicate, with, each, other, these, ideas, can, then, be, studied, and, understood, by, other, cultures, in, order, to, bridge, gaps, in, modes, of, communication, and, help, different, cultures, communicate, effectively, with, each, other, james, zappen, defines, cultural, rhetorics, as, the, idea, that, rhetoric, is, concerned, with, negotiation, and, listening, not, persuasion, which, differs, from, ancient, definitions, some, ancient, rhetoric, was, disparaged, because, its, persuasive, techniques, could, be, used, to, teach, falsehoods, communication, as, studied, in, cultural, rhetorics, is, focused, on, listening, and, negotiation, and, has, little, to, do, with, persuasion, rhetorical, education, focused, on, five, canons, the, five, canons, of, rhetoric, serve, as, a, guide, to, creating, persuasive, messages, and, arguments, memory, was, added, much, later, to, the, original, four, canons, during, the, renaissance, rhetoric, enjoyed, a, resurgence, and, as, a, result, nearly, every, author, who, wrote, about, music, before, the, romantic, era, discussed, rhetoric, joachim, burmeister, wrote, in, 1601, there, is, only, little, difference, between, music, and, the, nature, of, oration, christoph, bernhard, in, the, latter, half, of, the, century, said, until, the, art, of, music, has, attained, such, a, height, in, our, own, day, that, it, may, indeed, be, compared, to, a, rhetoric, in, view, of, the, multitude, of, figures, epistemology, and, rhetoric, have, been, compared, to, one, another, for, decades, but, the, specifications, of, their, similarities, have, gone, undefined, since, scholar, robert, l, scott, stated, that, rhetoric, is, epistemic, rhetoricians, and, philosophers, alike, have, struggled, to, concretely, define, the, expanse, of, implications, these, words, hold, those, who, have, identified, this, inconsistency, maintain, the, idea, that, scott, s, relation, is, important, but, requires, further, study, the, root, of, the, issue, lies, in, the, ambiguous, use, of, the, term, rhetoric, itself, as, well, as, the, epistemological, terms, knowledge, certainty, and, truth, though, counterintuitive, and, vague, scott, s, claims, are, accepted, by, some, academics, but, are, then, used, to, draw, different, conclusions, sonja, k, foss, for, example, takes, on, the, view, that, rhetoric, creates, knowledge, whereas, james, herrick, writes, that, rhetoric, assists, in, people, s, ability, to, form, beliefs, which, are, defined, as, knowledge, once, they, become, widespread, in, a, community, it, is, unclear, whether, scott, holds, that, certainty, is, an, inherent, part, of, establishing, knowledge, his, references, to, the, term, abstract, he, is, not, the, only, one, as, the, debate, s, persistence, in, philosophical, circles, long, predates, his, addition, of, rhetoric, there, is, an, overwhelming, majority, that, does, support, the, concept, of, certainty, as, a, requirement, for, knowledge, but, it, is, at, the, definition, of, certainty, where, parties, begin, to, diverge, one, definition, maintains, that, certainty, is, subjective, and, feeling, based, the, other, that, it, is, a, byproduct, of, justification, the, more, commonly, accepted, definition, of, rhetoric, claims, it, is, synonymous, with, persuasion, for, rhetorical, purposes, this, definition, like, many, others, is, too, broad, the, same, issue, presents, itself, with, definitions, that, are, too, narrow, rhetoricians, in, support, of, the, epistemic, view, of, rhetoric, have, yet, to, agree, in, this, regard, philosophical, teachings, refer, to, knowledge, as, a, justified, true, belief, however, the, gettier, problem, explores, the, room, for, fallacy, in, this, concept, therefore, the, gettier, problem, impedes, the, effectivity, of, the, argument, of, richard, a, cherwitz, and, james, a, hikins, who, employ, the, justified, true, belief, standpoint, in, their, argument, for, rhetoric, as, epistemic, celeste, condit, railsback, takes, a, different, approach, drawing, from, ray, e, mckerrow, s, system, of, belief, based, on, validity, rather, than, certainty, william, d, harpine, refers, to, the, issue, of, unclear, definitions, that, occurs, in, the, theories, of, rhetoric, is, epistemic, in, his, 2004, article, what, do, you, mean, rhetoric, is, epistemic, in, it, he, focuses, on, uncovering, the, most, appropriate, definitions, for, the, terms, rhetoric, knowledge, and, certainty, according, to, harpine, certainty, is, either, objective, or, subjective, although, both, scotts, and, cherwitz, and, hikins, theories, deal, with, some, form, of, certainty, harpine, believes, that, knowledge, is, not, required, to, be, neither, objectively, nor, subjectively, certain, in, terms, of, rhetoric, harpine, argues, that, the, definition, of, rhetoric, as, the, art, of, persuasion, is, the, best, choice, in, the, context, of, this, theoretical, approach, of, rhetoric, as, epistemic, harpine, then, proceeds, to, present, two, methods, of, approaching, the, idea, of, rhetoric, as, epistemic, based, on, the, definitions, presented, one, centers, on, alston, s, view, that, one, s, beliefs, are, justified, if, formed, by, one, s, normal, doxastic, while, the, other, focuses, on, the, causal, theory, of, knowledge, both, approaches, manage, to, avoid, gettier, s, problems, and, do, not, rely, on, unclear, conceptions, of, certainty, in, the, discussion, of, rhetoric, and, epistemology, comes, the, question, of, ethics, is, it, ethical, for, rhetoric, to, present, itself, in, the, branch, of, knowledge, scott, rears, this, question, addressing, the, issue, not, with, ambiguity, in, the, definitions, of, other, terms, but, against, subjectivity, regarding, certainty, ultimately, according, to, thomas, o, sloane, rhetoric, and, epistemology, exist, as, counterparts, working, towards, the, same, purpose, of, establishing, knowledge, with, the, common, enemy, of, subjective, certainty, rhetoric, is, a, persuasive, speech, that, holds, people, to, a, common, purpose, and, therefore, facilitates, collective, action, during, the, fifth, century, bce, athens, had, become, active, in, metropolis, and, people, all, over, there, during, this, time, the, greek, city, state, had, been, experimenting, with, a, new, form,

the, senate, jury, trials, and, forms, of, public, discussions, but, people, needed, to, learn, how, to, navigate, these, new, institutions, with, no, forms, of, passing, on, the, information, other, than, word, of, mouth, the, athenians, needed, an, effective, strategy, to, inform, the, people, a, group, of, wandering, sicilian, s, later, known, as, the, sophists, began, teaching, the, athenians, persuasive, speech, with, the, goal, of, navigating, the, courts, and, senate, the, sophists, became, speech, teachers, known, as, sophia, greek, for, wisdom, and, root, for, philosophy, or, love, of, wisdom, the, sophists, came, to, be, common, term, for, someone, who, sold, wisdom, for, money, although, there, is, no, clear, understanding, why, the, sicilians, engaged, to, educating, the, athenians, persuasive, speech, it, is, known, that, the, athenians, did, indeed, rely, on, persuasive, speech, more, during, public, speak, and, four, new, political, processes, also, increasing, the, sophists, trainings, leading, too, many, victories, for, legal, cases, public, debate, and, even, a, simple, persuasive, speech, this, ultimately, led, to, concerns, rising, on, falsehood, over, truth, with, highly, trained, persuasive, speakers, knowingly, misinforming, rhetoric, has, its, origins, in, mesopotamia, some, of, the, earliest, examples, of, rhetoric, can, be, found, in, the, akkadian, writings, of, the, princess, and, priestess, enheduanna, c, 2285, 2250, bce, as, the, first, named, author, in, history, enheduanna, s, writing, exhibits, numerous, rhetorical, features, that, would, later, become, canon, in, ancient, greece, enheduanna, s, the, exaltation, of, inanna, includes, an, exordium, argument, and, peroration, as, well, as, elements, of, ethos, pathos, and, logos, and, repetition, and, metonymy, she, is, also, known, for, describing, her, process, of, invention, in, the, exaltation, of, inanna, moving, between, first, and, third, person, address, to, relate, her, composing, process, in, collaboration, with, the, goddess, inanna, reflecting, a, mystical, enthymeme, in, drawing, upon, a, cosmic, audience, later, examples, of, early, rhetoric, can, be, found, in, the, neo, assyrian, empire, during, the, time, of, sennacherib, 704, 681, bce, in, ancient, egypt, rhetoric, had, existed, since, at, least, the, middle, kingdom, period, c, 2080, 1640, bce, the, five, canons, of, eloquence, in, ancient, egyptian, rhetoric, were, silence, timing, restraint, fluency, and, truthfulness, the, egyptians, held, eloquent, speaking, in, high, esteem, egyptian, rules, of, rhetoric, specified, that, knowing, when, not, to, speak, is, essential, and, very, respected, rhetorical, knowledge, making, rhetoric, a, balance, between, eloquence, and, wise, silence, they, also, emphasized, adherence, to, social, behaviors, that, support, a, conservative, status, quo, and, they, held, that, skilled, speech, should, support, not, question, society, in, ancient, china, rhetoric, dates, back, to, the, chinese, philosopher, confucius, 551, 479, bce, the, tradition, of, confucianism, emphasized, the, use, of, eloquence, in, speaking, the, use, of, rhetoric, can, also, be, found, in, the, ancient, biblical, tradition, in, europe, organized, thought, about, public, speaking, began, in, ancient, greece, in, ancient, greece, the, earliest, mention, of, oratorical, skill, occurs, in, homer, s, iliad, in, which, heroes, like, achilles, hector, and, odysseus, were, honored, for, their, ability, to, advise, and, exhort, their, peers, and, followers, the, laos, or, army, to, wise, and, appropriate, action, with, the, rise, of, the, democratic, polis, speaking, skill, was, adapted, to, the, needs, of, the, public, and, political, life, of, cities, in, ancient, greece, greek, citizens, used, oratory, to, make, political, and, judicial, decisions, and, to, develop, and, disseminate, philosophical, ideas, for, modern, students, it, can, be, difficult, to, remember, that, the, wide, use, and, availability, of, written, texts, is, a, phenomenon, that, was, just, coming, into, vogue, in, classical, greece, in, classical, times, many, of, the, great, thinkers, and, political, leaders, performed, their, works, before, an, audience, usually, in, the, context, of, a, competition, or, contest, for, fame, political, influence, and, cultural, capital, in, fact, many, of, them, are, known, only, through, the, texts, that, their, students, followers, or, detractors, wrote, down, rhetor, was, the, greek, term, for, orator, a, rhetor, was, a, citizen, who, regularly, addressed, juries, and, political, assemblies, and, who, was, thus, understood, to, have, gained, some, knowledge, about, public, speaking, in, the, process, though, in, general, facility, with, language, was, often, referred, to, as, log, n, techne, skill, with, arguments, or, verbal, artistry, possibly, the, first, study, about, the, power, of, language, may, be, attributed, to, the, philosopher, empedocles, d, c, 444, bce, whose, theories, on, human, knowledge, would, provide, a, basis, for, many, future, rhetoricians, the, first, written, manual, is, attributed, to, corax, and, his, pupil, tisias, their, work, as, well, as, that, of, many, of, the, early, rhetoricians, grew, out, of, the, courts, of, law, tisias, for, example, is, believed, to, have, written, judicial, speeches, that, others, delivered, in, the, courts, rhetoric, evolved, as, an, important, art, one, that, provided, the, orator, with, the, forms, means, and, strategies, for, persuading, an, audience, of, the, correctness, of, the, orator, s, arguments, today, the, term, rhetoric, can, be, used, at, times, to, refer, only, to, the, form, of, argumentation, often, with, the, pejorative, connotation, that, rhetoric, is, a, means, of, obscuring, the, truth, classical, philosophers, believed, quite, the, contrary, the, skilled, use, of, rhetoric, was, essential, to, the, discovery, of, truths, because, it, provided, the, means, of, ordering, and, clarifying, arguments, teaching, in, oratory, was, popularized, in, the, 5th, century, bce, by, itinerant, teachers, known, as, sophists, the, best, known, of, whom, were, protagoras, c, 481, 420, bce, gorgias, c, 483, 376, bce, and, isocrates, 436, 338, bce, aspasia, of, miletus, is, believed, to, be, one, of, the, first, women, to, engage, in, private, and, public, rhetorical, activities, as, a, sophist, the, sophists, were, a, disparate, group, who, travelled, from, city, to, city, teaching, in, public, places, to, attract, students, and, offer, them, an, education, their, central, focus, was, on, logos, or, what, we, might, broadly, refer, to, as, discourse, its, functions, and, powers, they, defined, parts, of, speech, analyzed, poetry, parsed, close, synonyms, invented, argumentation, strategies, and, debated, the, nature, of, reality, they, claimed, to, make, their, students, better, or, in, other, words, to, teach, virtue, they, thus, claimed, that, human, excellence, was, not, an, accident, of, fate, or, a, prerogative, of, noble, birth, but, an, art, or, techne, that, could, be, taught, and, learned, they, were, thus, among, the, first, humanists, several, sophists, also, questioned, received, wisdom, about, the, gods, and, the, greek, culture, which, they, believed, was, taken, for, granted, by, greeks, of, their, time, making, these, sophists, among, the, first, agnostics, for, example, they, argued, that, cultural, practices, were, a, function, of, convention, or, nomos, rather, than, blood, or, birth, or, phusis, they, argued, further, that, the, morality, or, immorality, of, any, action, could, not, be, judged, outside, of, the, cultural, context, within, which, it, occurred, the, well, known, phrase, man, is, the, measure, of, all, things, arises, from, this, belief, one, of, the, sophists, most, famous, and, infamous, doctrines, has, to, do, with, probability, and, counter, arguments, they, taught, that, every, argument, could, be, countered, with, an, opposing, argument, that, an, argument, s, effectiveness, derived, from, how, likely, it, appeared, to, the, audience, its, probability, of, seeming, true, and, that, any, probability, argument, could, be, countered, with, an, inverted, probability, argument, thus, if, it, seemed, likely, that, a, strong, poor, man, were, guilty, of, robbing, a, rich, weak, man, the, strong, poor, man, could, argue, on, the, contrary, that, this, very, likelihood, that, he, would, be, a, suspect, makes, it, unlikely, that, he, committed, the, crime, since, he, would, most, likely, be, apprehended, for, the, crime, they, also, taught, and, were, known, for, their, ability, to, make, the, weaker, or, worse, argument, the, stronger, or, better, aristophanes, famously, parodies, the, clever, inversions, that, sophists, were, known, for, in, his, play, the, clouds, the, word, sophistry, developed, negative, connotations, in, ancient, greece, that, continue, today, but, in, ancient, greece, sophists, were, nevertheless, popular, and, well, paid, professionals, respected, for, their, abilities, but, also, criticized, for, their, excesses, according, to, william, keith, and, christian, lundberg, as, the, greek, society, shifted, towards, more, democratic, values, the, sophists, were, responsible, for, teaching, the, newly, democratic, greek, society, the, importance, of, persuasive, speech, and, strategic, communication, for, its, new, governmental, institutions, isocrates, 436, 338, bce, like, the, sophists, taught, public, speaking, as, a, means, of, human, improvement, but, he, worked, to, distinguish, himself, from, the, sophists, whom, he, saw, as, claiming, far, more, than, they, could, deliver, he, suggested, that, while, an, art, of, virtue, or, excellence, did, exist, it, was, only, one, piece, and, the, least, in, a, process, of, self, improvement, that, relied, much, more, on, native, talent, desire, constant, practice, and, the, imitation, of, good, models, isocrates, believed, that, practice, in, speaking, publicly, about, noble, themes, and, important, questions, would, improve, the, character, of, both, speaker, and, audience, while, also, offering, the, best, service, to, a, city, isocrates, was, an, outspoken, champion, of, rhetoric, as, a, mode, of, civic, engagement, he, thus, wrote, his, speeches, as, models, for, his, students, to, imitate, in, the, same, way, that, poets, might, imitate, homer, or, hesiod, seeking, to, inspire, in, them, a, desire, to, attain, fame, through, civic, leadership, his, was, the, first, permanent, school, in, athens, and, it, is, likely, that, plato, s, academy, and, aristotle, s, lyceum, were, founded, in, part, as, a, response, to, isocrates, though, he, left, no, handbooks, his, speeches, antidosis, and, against, the, sophists, are, most, relevant, to, students, of, rhetoric, became, models, of, oratory, and, keys, to, his, entire, educational, program, he, was, one, of, the, canonical, ten, attic, orators, he, influenced, cicero, and, quintilian, and, through, them, the, entire, educational, system, of, the, west, plato, 427, 347, bce, outlined, the, differences, between, true, and, false, rhetoric, in, a, number, of, dialogues, particularly, the, gorgias, and, phaedrus, dialogues, in, which, plato, disputes, the, sophistic, notion, that, the, art, of, persuasion, the, sophists, art, which, he, calls, rhetoric, can, exist, independent, of, the, art, of, dialectic, plato, claims, that, since, sophists, appeal, only, to, what, seems, probable, they, are, not, advancing, their, students, and, audiences, but, simply, flattering, them, with, what, they, want, to, hear, while, plato, s, condemnation, of, rhetoric, is, clear, in, the, gorgias, in, the, phaedrus, he, suggests, the, possibility, of, a, true, art, wherein, rhetoric, is, based, upon, the, knowledge, produced, by, dialectic, he, relies, on, a, dialectically, informed, rhetoric, to, appeal, to, the, main, character, phaedrus, to, take, up, philosophy, thus, plato, s, rhetoric, is, actually, dialectic, or, philosophy, turned, toward, those, who, are, not, yet, philosophers, and, are, thus, unready, to, pursue, dialectic, directly, plato, s, animosity, against, rhetoric, and, against, the, sophists, derives, not, only, from, their, inflated, claims, to, teach, virtue, and, their, reliance, on, appearances, but, from, the, fact, that, his, teacher, socrates, was, sentenced, to, death, after, sophists, efforts, some, scholars, however, see, plato, not, as, an, opponent, of, rhetoric, but, rather, as, a, nuanced, rhetorical, theorist, who, dramatized, rhetorical, practice, in, his, dialogues, and, imagined, rhetoric, as, more, than, just, oratory, aristotle, rhetoric, is, an, antistrophes, to, dialectic, let, rhetoric, an, ability, in, each, case, to, see, the, available, means, of, persuasion, rhetoric, is, a, counterpart, of, dialectic, an, art, of, practical, civic, reasoning, applied, to, deliberative, judicial, and, display, speeches, in, political, assemblies, lawcourts, and, other, public, gatherings, aristotle, 384, 322, bce, was, a, student, of, plato, who, set, forth, an, extended, treatise, on, rhetoric, that, still, repays, careful, study, today, in, the, first, sentence, of, the, art, of, rhetoric, aristotle, says, that, rhetoric, is, the, antistrophe, of, dialectic, i, 1, as, the, antistrophe, of, a, greek, ode, responds, to, and, is, patterned, after, the, structure, of, the, strophe, they, form, two, sections, of, the, whole, and, are, sung, by, two, parts, of, the, chorus, so, the, art, of, rhetoric, follows, and, is, structurally, patterned, after, the, art, of, dialectic, because, both, are, arts, of, discourse, production, while, dialectical, methods, are, necessary, to, find, truth, in, theoretical, matters, rhetorical, methods, are, required, in, practical, matters, such, as, adjudicating, somebody, s, guilt, or, innocence, when, charged, in, a, court, of, law, or, adjudicating, a, prudent, course, of, action, to, be, taken, in, a, deliberative, assembly, for, plato, and, aristotle, dialectic, involves, persuasion, so, when, aristotle, says, that, rhetoric, is, the, antistrophe, of, dialectic, he, means, that, rhetoric, as, he, uses, the, term, has, a, domain, or, scope, of, application, that, is, parallel, to, but, different, from, the, domain, or, scope, of, application, of, dialectic, claude, pavur, explains, that, he, greek, prefix, anti, does, not, merely, designate, opposition, but, it, can, also, mean, in, place, of, aristotle, s, treatise, on, rhetoric, systematically, describes, civic, rhetoric, as, a, human, art, or, skill, techne, it, is, more, of, an, objective, theory, than, it, is, an, interpretive, theory, with, a, rhetorical, tradition, aristotle, s, art, of, rhetoric, emphasizes, persuasion, as, the, purpose, of, rhetoric, his, definition, of, rhetoric, as, the, faculty, of, observing, in, any, given, case, the, available, means, of, persuasion, essentially, a, mode, of, discovery, limits, the, art, to, the, inventional, process, aristotle, emphasizes, the, logical, aspect, of, this, process, a, speaker, supports, the, probability, of, a, message, by, logical, ethical, and, emotional, proofs, aristotle, identifies, three, steps, or, offices, of, rhetoric, invention, arrangement, and, style, and, three, different, types, of, rhetorical, proof, i, 2, aristotle, emphasized, enthymematic, reasoning, as, central, to, the, process, of, rhetorical, invention, though, later, rhetorical, theorists, placed, much, less, emphasis, on, it, an, enthymeme, follows, the, form, of, a, syllogism, however, it, excludes, either, the, major, or, minor, premise, an, enthymeme, is, persuasive, because, the, audience, provides, the, missing, premise, because, the, audience, participates, in, providing, the, missing, premise, they, are, more, likely, to, be, persuaded, by, the, message, aristotle, identified, three, different, types, or, genres, of, civic, rhetoric, i, 3, another, aristotelian, doctrine, was, the, idea, of, topics, also, referred, to, as, common, topics, or, commonplaces, though, the, term, had, a, wide, range, of, application, as, a, memory, technique, or, compositional, exercise, for, example, it, most, often, referred, to, the, seats, of, argument, the, list, of, categories, of, thought, or, modes, of, reasoning, that, a, speaker, could, use, to, generate, arguments, or, proofs, the, topics, were, thus, a, heuristic, or, inventional, tool, designed, to, help, speakers, categorize, and, thus, better, retain, and, apply, frequently, used, types, of, argument, for, example, since, we, often, see, effects, as, like, their, causes, one, way, to, invent, an, argument, about, a, future, effect, is, by, discussing, the, cause, which, it, will, be, like, this, and, other, rhetorical, topics, derive, from, aristotle, s, belief, that, there, are, certain, predictable, ways, in, which, humans, particularly, non, specialists, draw, conclusions, from, premises, based, upon, and, adapted, from, his, dialectical, topics, the, rhetorical, topics, became, a, central, feature, of, later, rhetorical, theorizing, most, famously, in, cicero, s, work, of, that, name, india, s, struggle, for, independence, offers, a, vivid, description, of, the, culture, that, sprang, up, around, the, newspaper, in, village, india, of, the, early, 1870s, a, newspaper, would, reach, remote, villages, and, would, then, be, read, by, a, reader, to, tens, of, others, gradually, library, movements, sprung, up, all, over, the, country, a, local, library, would, be, organized, around, a, single, newspaper, a, table, a, bench, or, two, or, a, charpoy, would, constitute, the, capital, equipment, every, piece, of, news, or, editorial, comment, would, be, read, or, heard, and, thoroughly, discussed, the, newspaper, not, only, became, the, political, educator, reading, or, discussing, it, became, a, form, of, political, participation, this, reading, and, discussion, was, the, focal, point, of, origin, of, the, modern, indian, rhetorical, movement, much, before, this, ancients, such, as, kautilya, birbal, and, the, like, indulged, in, a, great, deal, of, discussion, and, persuasion, keith, lloyd, argued, that, much, of, the, recital, of, the, vedas, can, be, likened, to, the, recital, of, ancient, greek, poetry, lloyd, proposed, including, the, ny, ya, s, tras, in, the, field, of, rhetorical, studies, exploring, its, methods, within, their, historical, context, comparing, its, approach, to, the, traditional, logical, syllogism, and, relating, it, to, modern, perspectives, of, stephen, toulmin, kenneth, burke, and, chaim, perelman, nyaya, is, a, sanskrit, word, which, means, just, or, right, and, refers, to, the, science, of, right, and, wrong, reasoning, 356, sutra, is, also, a, sanskrit, word, which, means, string, or, thread, here, sutra, refers, to, a, collection, of, aphorism, in, the, form, of, a, manual, each, sutra, is, a, short, rule, usually, consisted, of, one, or, two, sentences, an, example, of, a, sutra, is, reality, is, truth, and, what, is, true, is, so, irrespective, of, whether, we, know, it, is, or, are, aware, of, that, truth, the, ny, ya, s, tras, is, an, ancient, indian, sanskrit, text, composed, by, aksapada, gautama, it, is, the, foundational, text, of, the, nyaya, school, of, hindu, philosophy, it, is, estimated, that, the, text, was, composed, between, 6th, century, bce, and, 2nd, century, ce, the, text, may, have, been, composed, by, more, one, author, over, a, period, of, time, radhakrishan, and, moore, placed, its, origin, in, the, third, century, bce, though, some, of, the, contents, of, the, nyaya, sutra, are, certainly, a, post, christian, era, 36, the, ancient, school, of, nyaya, extended, over, a, period, of, one, thousand, years, beginning, with, gautama, about, 550, bce, and, ending, with, vatsyayana, about, 400, ce, nyaya, provides, insight, into, indian, rhetoric, nyaya, presents, an, argumentative, approach, with, which, a, rhetor, can, decide, about, any, argument, in, addition, it, proposes, an, approach, to, thinking, about, cultural, tradition, which, is, different, from, western, rhetoric, whereas, toulmin, emphasizes, the, situational, dimension, of, argumentative, genre, as, the, fundamental, component, of, any, rhetorical, logic, nyaya, views, this, situational, rhetoric, in, a, new, way, which, offers, context, of, practical, arguments, some, of, india, s, famous, rhetors, include, kabir, das, rahim, das, chanakya, and, chandragupt, maurya, for, the, romans, oration, became, an, important, part, of, public, life, cicero, 106, 43, bce, was, chief, among, roman, rhetoricians, and, remains, the, best, known, ancient, orator, and, the, only, orator, who, both, spoke, in, public, and, produced, treatises, on, the, subject, rhetorica, ad, herennium, formerly, attributed, to, cicero, but, now, considered, to, be, of, unknown, authorship, is, one, of, the, most, significant, works, on, rhetoric, and, is, still, widely, used, as, a, reference, today, it, is, an, extensive, reference, on, the, use, of, rhetoric, and, in, the, middle, ages, and, renaissance, it, achieved, wide, publication, as, an, advanced, school, text, on, rhetoric, cicero, charted, a, middle, path, between, the, competing, attic, and, asiatic, styles, to, become, considered, second, only, to, demosthenes, among, history, s, orators, his, works, include, the, early, and, very, influential, de, inventione, on, invention, often, read, alongside, ad, herennium, as, the, two, basic, texts, of, rhetorical, theory, throughout, the, middle, ages, and, into, the, renaissance, de, oratore, a, fuller, statement, of, rhetorical, principles, in, dialogue, form, topics, a, rhetorical, treatment, of, common, topics, highly, influential, through, the, renaissance, brutus, a, discussion, of, famous, orators, and, orator, a, defense, of, cicero, s, style, cicero, also, left, a, large, body, of, speeches, and, letters, which, would, establish, the, outlines, of, latin, eloquence, and, style, for, generations, the, rediscovery, of, cicero, s, speeches, such, as, the, defense, of, archias, and, letters, to, atticus, by, italians, like, petrarch, helped, to, ignite, the, renaissance, cicero, championed, the, learning, of, greek, and, greek, rhetoric, contributed, to, roman, ethics, linguistics, philosophy, and, politics, and, emphasized, the, importance, of, all, forms, of, appeal, emotion, humor, stylistic, range, irony, and, digression, in, addition, to, pure, reasoning, in, oratory, but, perhaps, his, most, significant, contribution, to, subsequent, rhetoric, and, education, in, general, was, his, argument, that, orators, learn, not, only, about, the, specifics, of, their, case, the, hypothesis, but, also, about, the, general, questions, from, which, they, derived, the, theses, thus, in, giving, a, speech, in, defense, of, a, poet, whose, roman, citizenship, had, been, questioned, the, orator, should, examine, not, only, the, specifics, of, that, poet, s, civic, status, he, should, also, examine, the, role, and, value, of, poetry, and, of, literature, more, generally, in, roman, culture, and, political, life, the, orator, said, cicero, needed, to, be, knowledgeable, about, all, areas, of, human, life, and, culture, including, law, politics, history, literature, ethics, warfare, medicine, and, even, arithmetic, and, geometry, cicero, gave, rise, to, the, idea, that, the, ideal, orator, be, well, versed, in, all, branches, of, learning, an, idea, that, was, rendered, as, liberal, humanism, and, that, lives, on, today, in, liberal, arts, or, general, education, requirements, in, colleges, and, universities, around, the, world, quintilian, 35, 100, ce, began, his, career, as, a, pleader, in, the, courts, of, law, his, reputation, grew, so, great, that, vespasian, created, a, chair, of, rhetoric, for, him, in, rome, the, culmination, of, his, life, s, work, was, the, institutio, oratoria, institutes, of, oratory, or, alternatively, the, orator, s, education, a, lengthy, treatise, on, the, training, of, the, orator, in, which, he, discusses, the, training, of, the, perfect, orator, from, birth, to, old, age, and, in, the, process, reviews, the, doctrines, and, opinions, of, many, influential, rhetoricians, who, preceded, him, in, the, institutes, quintilian, organizes, rhetorical, study, through, the, stages, of, education, that, an, aspiring, orator, would, undergo, beginning, with, the, selection, of, a, nurse, aspects, of, elementary, education, training, in, reading, and, writing, grammar, and, literary, criticism, are, followed, by, preliminary, rhetorical, exercises, in, composition, the, progymnasmata, that, include, maxims, and, fables, narratives, and, comparisons, and, finally, full, legal, or, political, speeches, the, delivery, of, speeches, within, the, context, of, education, or, for, entertainment, purposes, became, widespread, and, popular, under, the, term, declamation, this, work, was, available, only, in, fragments, in, medieval, times, but, the, discovery, of, a, complete, copy, at, the, abbey, of, st, gall, in, 1416, led, to, its, emergence, as, one, of, the, most, influential, works, on, rhetoric, during, the, renaissance, quintilian, s, work, describes, not, just, the, art, of, rhetoric, but, the, formation, of, the, perfect, orator, as, a, politically, active, virtuous, publicly, minded, citizen, his, emphasis, was, on, the, ethical, application, of, rhetorical, training, in, part, in, reaction, against, the, tendency, in, roman, schools, toward, standardization, of, themes, and, techniques, at, the, same, time, that, rhetoric, was, becoming, divorced, from, political, decision, making, rhetoric, rose, as, a, culturally, vibrant, and, important, mode, of, entertainment, and, cultural, criticism, in, a, movement, known, as, the, second, sophistic, a, development, that, gave, rise, to, the, charge, made, by, quintilian, and, others, that, teachers, were, emphasizing, style, over, substance, in, rhetoric, after, the, breakup, of, the, western, roman, empire, the, study, of, rhetoric, continued, to, be, central, to, the, study, of, the, verbal, arts, however, the, study, of, the, verbal, arts, went, into, decline, for, several, centuries, followed, eventually, by, a, gradual, rise, in, formal, education, culminating, in, the, rise, of, medieval, universities, rhetoric, transmuted, during, this, period, into, the, arts, of, letter, writing, ars, dictaminis, and, sermon, writing, ars, praedicandi, as, part, of, the, trivium, rhetoric, was, secondary, to, the, study, of, logic, and, its, study, was, highly, scholastic, students, were, given, repetitive, exercises, in, the, creation, of, discourses, on, historical, subjects, suasoriae, or, on, classic, legal, questions, controversiae, although, he, is, not, commonly, regarded, as, a, rhetorician, st, augustine, 354, 430, was, trained, in, rhetoric, and, was, at, one, time, a, professor, of, latin, rhetoric, in, milan, after, his, conversion, to, christianity, he, became, interested, in, using, these, pagan, arts, for, spreading, his, religion, he, explores, this, new, use, of, rhetoric, in, de, doctrina, christiana, which, laid, the, foundation, of, what, would, become, homiletics, the, rhetoric, of, the, sermon, augustine, asks, why, the, power, of, eloquence, which, is, so, efficacious, in, pleading, either, for, the, erroneous, cause, or, the, right, should, not, be, used, for, righteous, purposes, one, early, concern, of, the, medieval, christian, church, was, its, attitude, to, classical, rhetoric, itself, jerome, d, 420, complained, what, has, horace, to, do, with, the, psalms, virgil, with, the, gospels, cicero, with, the, apostles, augustine, is, also, remembered, for, arguing, for, the, preservation, of, pagan, works, and, fostering, a, church, tradition, that, led, to, conservation, of, numerous, pre, christian, rhetorical, writings, rhetoric, would, not, regain, its, classical, heights, until, the, renaissance, but, new, writings, did, advance, rhetorical, thought, boethius, c, 480, 524, in, his, brief, overview, of, the, structure, of, rhetoric, continues, aristotle, s, taxonomy, by, placing, rhetoric, in, subordination, to, philosophical, argument, or, dialectic, the, introduction, of, arab, scholarship, from, european, relations, with, the, muslim, empire, in, particular, al, andalus, renewed, interest, in, aristotle, and, classical, thought, in, general, leading, to, what, some, historians, call, the, 12th, century, renaissance, a, number, of, medieval, grammars, and, studies, of, poetry, and, rhetoric, appeared, late, medieval, rhetorical, writings, include, those, of, st, thomas, aquinas, c, 1225, 1274, matthew, of, vend, me, ars, versificatoria, c, 1175, and, geoffrey, of, vinsauf, poetria, nova, 1200, 1216, pre, modern, female, rhetoricians, outside, of, socrates, friend, aspasia, are, rare, but, medieval, rhetoric, produced, by, women, either, in, religious, orders, such, as, julian, of, norwich, d, 1415, or, the, very, well, connected, christine, de, pizan, c, 1364, c, 1430, did, occur, although, it, was, not, always, recorded, in, writing, in, his, 1943, cambridge, university, doctoral, dissertation, in, english, canadian, marshall, mcluhan, 1911, 1980, surveys, the, verbal, arts, from, approximately, the, time, of, cicero, down, to, the, time, of, thomas, nashe, 1567, c, 1600, his, dissertation, is, still, noteworthy, for, undertaking, to, study, the, history, of, the, verbal, arts, together, as, the, trivium, even, though, the, developments, that, he, surveys, have, been, studied, in, greater, detail, since, he, undertook, his, study, as, noted, below, mcluhan, became, one, of, the, most, widely, publicized, communication, theorists, of, the, 20th, century, another, interesting, record, of, medieval, rhetorical, thought, can, be, seen, in, the, many, animal, debate, poems, popular, in, england, and, the, continent, during, the, middle, ages, such, as, the, owl, and, the, nightingale, 13th, century, and, geoffrey, chaucer, s, parliament, of, fowls, renaissance, humanism, defined, itself, broadly, as, disfavoring, medieval, scholastic, logic, and, dialectic, and, as, favoring, instead, the, study, of, classical, latin, style, and, grammar, and, philology, and, rhetoric, one, influential, figure, in, the, rebirth, of, interest, in, classical, rhetoric, was, erasmus, c, 1466, 1536, his, 1512, work, de, duplici, copia, verborum, et, rerum, also, known, as, copia, foundations, of, the, abundant, style, was, widely, published, it, went, through, more, than, 150, editions, throughout, europe, and, became, one, of, the, basic, school, texts, on, the, subject, its, treatment, of, rhetoric, is, less, comprehensive, than, the, classic, works, of, antiquity, but, provides, a, traditional, treatment, of, res, verba, matter, and, form, its, first, book, treats, the, subject, of, elocutio, showing, the, student, how, to, use, schemes, and, tropes, the, second, book, covers, inventio, much, of, the, emphasis, is, on, abundance, of, variation, copia, means, plenty, or, abundance, as, in, copious, or, cornucopia, so, both, books, focus, on, ways, to, introduce, the, maximum, amount, of, variety, into, discourse, for, instance, in, one, section, of, the, de, copia, erasmus, presents, two, hundred, variations, of, the, sentence, always, as, long, as, i, live, i, shall, remember, you, semper, dum, vivam, tui, meminero, another, of, his, works, the, extremely, popular, the, praise, of, folly, also, had, considerable, influence, on, the, teaching, of, rhetoric, in, the, later, 16th, century, its, orations, in, favour, of, qualities, such, as, madness, spawned, a, type, of, exercise, popular, in, elizabethan, grammar, schools, later, called, adoxography, which, required, pupils, to, compose, passages, in, praise, of, useless, things, juan, luis, vives, 1492, 1540, also, helped, shape, the, study, of, rhetoric, in, england, a, spaniard, he, was, appointed, in, 1523, to, the, lectureship, of, rhetoric, at, oxford, by, cardinal, wolsey, and, was, entrusted, by, henry, viii, to, be, one, of, the, tutors, of, mary, vives, fell, into, disfavor, when, henry, viii, divorced, catherine, of, aragon, and, left, england, in, 1528, his, best, known, work, was, a, book, on, education, de, disciplinis, published, in, 1531, and, his, writings, on, rhetoric, included, rhetoricae, sive, de, ratione, dicendi, libri, tres, 1533, de, consultatione, 1533, and, a, treatise, on, letter, writing, de, conscribendis, epistolas, 1536, it, is, likely, that, many, well, known, english, writers, were, exposed, to, the, works, of, erasmus, and, vives, as, well, as, those, of, the, classical, rhetoricians, in, their, schooling, which, was, conducted, in, latin, not, english, often, included, some, study, of, greek, and, placed, considerable, emphasis, on, rhetoric, the, mid, 16th, century, saw, the, rise, of, vernacular, rhetorics, those, written, in, english, rather, than, in, the, classical, languages, adoption, of, works, in, english, was, slow, however, due, to, the, strong, scholastic, orientation, toward, latin, and, greek, leonard, cox, s, the, art, or, crafte, of, rhetoryke, c, 1524, 1530, second, edition, published, in, 1532, is, the, earliest, text, on, rhetorics, in, english, it, was, for, the, most, part, a, translation, of, the, work, of, philipp, melanchthon, thomas, wilson, s, the, arte, of, rhetorique, 1553, presents, a, traditional, treatment, of, rhetoric, for, instance, the, standard, five, canons, of, rhetoric, other, notable, works, included, angel, day, s, the, english, secretorie, 1586, 1592, george, puttenham, s, the, arte, of, english, poesie, 1589, and, richard, rainholde, s, foundacion, of, rhetorike, 1563, during, this, same, period, a, movement, began, that, would, change, the, organization, of, the, school, curriculum, in, protestant, and, especially, puritan, circles, and, that, led, to, rhetoric, losing, its, central, place, a, french, scholar, petrus, ramus, 1515, 1572, dissatisfied, with, what, he, saw, as, the, overly, broad, and, redundant, organization, of, the, trivium, proposed, a, new, curriculum, in, his, scheme, of, things, the, five, components, of, rhetoric, no, longer, lived, under, the, common, heading, of, rhetoric, instead, invention, and, disposition, were, determined, to, fall, exclusively, under, the, heading, of, dialectic, while, style, delivery, and, memory, were, all, that, remained, for, rhetoric, ramus, was, martyred, during, the, french, wars, of, religion, his, teachings, seen, as, inimical, to, catholicism, were, short, lived, in, france, but, found, a, fertile, ground, in, the, netherlands, germany, and, england, one, of, ramus, french, followers, audomarus, talaeus, omer, talon, published, his, rhetoric, institutiones, oratoriae, in, 1544, this, work, emphasized, style, and, became, so, popular, that, it, was, mentioned, in, john, brinsley, s, 1612, ludus, literarius, or, the, grammar, schoole, as, being, the, most, used, in, the, best, schooles, many, other, ramist, rhetorics, followed, in, the, next, half, century, and, by, the, 17th, century, their, approach, became, the, primary, method, of, teaching, rhetoric, in, protestant, and, especially, puritan, circles, john, milton, 1608, 1674, wrote, a, textbook, in, logic, or, dialectic, in, latin, based, on, ramus, work, ramism, could, not, exert, any, influence, on, the, established, catholic, schools, and, universities, which, remained, loyal, to, scholasticism, or, on, the, new, catholic, schools, and, universities, founded, by, members, of, the, society, of, jesus, or, the, oratorians, as, can, be, seen, in, the, jesuit, curriculum, in, use, up, to, the, 19th, century, across, the, christian, world, known, as, the, ratio, studiorum, if, the, influence, of, cicero, and, quintilian, permeates, the, ratio, studiorum, it, is, through, the, lenses, of, devotion, and, the, militancy, of, the, counter, reformation, the, ratio, was, indeed, imbued, with, a, sense, of, the, divine, of, the, incarnate, logos, that, is, of, rhetoric, as, an, eloquent, and, humane, means, to, reach, further, devotion, and, further, action, in, the, christian, city, which, was, absent, from, ramist, formalism, the, ratio, is, in, rhetoric, the, answer, to, ignatius, loyola, s, practice, in, devotion, of, spiritual, exercises, this, complex, oratorical, prayer, system, is, absent, from, ramism, in, new, england, and, at, harvard, college, founded, 1636, ramus, and, his, followers, dominated, however, in, england, several, writers, influenced, the, course, of, rhetoric, during, the, 17th, century, many, of, them, carrying, forward, the, dichotomy, that, had, been, set, forth, by, ramus, and, his, followers, during, the, preceding, decades, this, century, also, saw, the, development, of, a, modern, vernacular, style, that, looked, to, english, rather, than, to, greek, latin, or, french, models, francis, bacon, 1561, 1626, although, not, a, rhetorician, contributed, to, the, field, in, his, writings, one, of, the, concerns, of, the, age, was, to, find, a, suitable, style, for, the, discussion, of, scientific, topics, which, needed, above, all, a, clear, exposition, of, facts, and, arguments, rather, than, an, ornate, style, bacon, in, his, the, advancement, of, learning, criticized, those, who, are, preoccupied, with, style, rather, than, the, weight, of, matter, worth, of, subject, soundness, of, argument, life, of, invention, or, depth, of, judgment, on, matters, of, style, he, proposed, that, the, style, conform, to, the, subject, matter, and, to, the, audience, that, simple, words, be, employed, whenever, possible, and, that, the, style, should, be, agreeable, thomas, hobbes, 1588, 1679, also, wrote, on, rhetoric, along, with, a, shortened, translation, of, aristotle, s, rhetoric, hobbes, also, produced, a, number, of, other, works, on, the, subject, sharply, contrarian, on, many, subjects, hobbes, like, bacon, also, promoted, a, simpler, and, more, natural, style, that, used, figures, of, speech, sparingly, perhaps, the, most, influential, development, in, english, style, came, out, of, the, work, of, the, royal, society, founded, in, 1660, which, in, 1664, set, up, a, committee, to, improve, the, english, language, among, the, committee, s, members, were, john, evelyn, 1620, 1706, thomas, sprat, 1635, 1713, and, john, dryden, 1631, 1700, sprat, regarded, fine, speaking, as, a, disease, and, thought, that, a, proper, style, should, reject, all, amplifications, digressions, and, swellings, of, style, and, instead, return, back, to, a, primitive, purity, and, shortness, while, the, work, of, this, committee, never, went, beyond, planning, john, dryden, is, often, credited, with, creating, and, exemplifying, a, new, and, modern, english, style, his, central, tenet, was, that, the, style, should, be, proper, to, the, occasion, the, subject, and, the, persons, as, such, he, advocated, the, use, of, english, words, whenever, possible, instead, of, foreign, ones, as, well, as, vernacular, rather, than, latinate, syntax, his, own, prose, and, his, poetry, became, exemplars, of, this, new, style, arguably, one, of, the, most, influential, schools, of, rhetoric, during, the, 18th, century, was, scottish, belletristic, rhetoric, exemplified, by, such, professors, of, rhetoric, as, hugh, blair, whose, lectures, on, rhetoric, and, belles, lettres, saw, international, success, in, various, editions, and, translations, and, lord, kames, with, his, influential, elements, of, criticism, another, notable, figure, in, 18th, century, rhetoric, was, maria, edgeworth, a, novelist, and, children, s, author, whose, work, often, parodied, the, male, centric, rhetorical, strategies, of, her, time, in, her, 1795, an, essay, on, the, noble, science, of, self, justification, edgeworth, presents, a, satire, of, enlightenment, rhetoric, s, science, centrism, and, the, belletristic, movement, she, was, called, the, great, maria, by, sir, walter, scott, with, whom, she, corresponded, and, by, modern, scholars, is, noted, as, a, transgressive, and, ironic, reader, of, the, 18th, century, rhetorical, norms, at, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, there, was, a, revival, of, rhetorical, study, manifested, in, the, establishment, of, departments, of, rhetoric, and, speech, at, academic, institutions, as, well, as, the, formation, of, national, and, international, professional, organizations, the, early, interest, in, rhetorical, studies, was, a, movement, away, from, elocution, as, taught, in, english, departments, in, the, united, states, and, an, attempt, to, refocus, rhetorical, studies, from, delivery, only, to, civic, engagement, and, a, rich, complexity, of, the, nature, of, rhetoric, by, the, 1930s, advances, in, mass, media, technology, led, to, a, revival, of, the, study, of, rhetoric, language, persuasion, and, political, rhetoric, and, its, consequences, the, linguistic, turn, in, philosophy, also, contributed, to, this, revival, the, term, rhetoric, came, to, be, applied, to, media, forms, other, than, verbal, language, e, g, visual, rhetoric, temporal, rhetorics, and, the, temporal, turn, in, rhetorical, theory, and, practice, the, rise, of, advertising, and, of, mass, media, such, as, photography, telegraphy, radio, and, film, brought, rhetoric, more, prominently, into, people, s, lives, the, discipline, of, rhetoric, has, been, used, to, study, how, advertising, persuades, and, to, help, understand, the, spread, of, fake, news, and, conspiracy, theories, on, social, media, rhetoric, can, be, analyzed, by, a, variety, of, methods, and, theories, one, such, method, is, criticism, when, those, using, criticism, analyze, instances, of, rhetoric, what, they, do, is, called, rhetorical, criticism, see, criticism, according, to, rhetorical, critic, jim, a, kuypers, the, use, of, rhetoric, is, an, art, and, as, such, it, does, not, lend, itself, well, to, scientific, methods, of, analysis, criticism, is, an, art, as, well, and, as, such, is, particularly, well, suited, for, examining, rhetorical, creations, 14, he, asserts, that, criticism, is, a, method, of, generating, knowledge, just, as, the, scientific, method, is, a, method, for, generating, knowledge, the, way, the, sciences, and, the, humanities, study, the, phenomena, that, surround, us, differ, greatly, in, the, amount, of, researcher, personality, allowed, to, influence, the, results, of, the, study, for, example, in, the, sciences, researchers, purposefully, adhere, to, a, strict, method, the, scientific, method, generally, speaking, the, researcher, s, personality, likes, and, dislikes, and, religious, and, political, preferences, are, supposed, to, be, as, far, removed, as, possible, from, the, actual, study, in, sharp, contrast, criticism, one, of, many, humanistic, methods, of, generating, knowledge, actively, involves, the, personality, of, the, researcher, the, very, choices, of, what, to, study, and, how, and, why, to, study, a, rhetorical, artifact, are, heavily, influenced, by, the, personal, qualities, of, the, researcher, in, the, humanities, methods, of, research, may, also, take, many, forms, criticism, ethnography, for, example, but, the, personality, of, the, researcher, is, an, integral, component, of, the, study, further, personalizing, criticism, we, find, that, rhetorical, critics, use, a, variety, of, means, when, examining, a, particular, rhetorical, artifact, with, some, critics, even, developing, their, own, unique, perspective, to, better, examine, a, rhetorical, artifact, 14, edwin, black, wrote, on, this, point, that, methods, then, admit, of, varying, degrees, of, personality, and, criticism, on, the, whole, is, near, the, indeterminate, contingent, personal, end, of, the, methodological, scale, in, consequence, of, this, placement, it, is, neither, possible, nor, desirable, for, criticism, to, be, fixed, into, a, system, for, critical, techniques, to, be, objectified, for, critics, to, be, interchangeable, for, purposes, of, replication, or, for, rhetorical, criticism, to, serve, as, the, handmaiden, of, quasi, scientific, theory, xi, jim, a, kuypers, sums, this, idea, of, criticism, as, art, in, the, following, manner, in, short, criticism, is, an, art, not, a, science, it, is, not, a, scientific, method, it, uses, subjective, methods, of, argument, it, exists, on, its, own, not, in, conjunction, with, other, methods, of, generating, knowledge, i, e, social, scientific, or, scientific, nsight, and, imagination, top, statistical, applications, when, studying, rhetorical, action, 14, 15, rhetorical, strategies, are, the, efforts, made, by, authors, or, speakers, to, persuade, or, inform, their, audiences, according, to, james, w, gray, there, are, various, argument, strategies, used, in, writing, he, describes, four, of, these, as, argument, from, analogy, argument, from, absurdity, thought, experiments, and, inference, to, the, best, explanation, modern, rhetorical, criticism, explores, the, relationship, between, text, and, context, that, is, how, an, instance, of, rhetoric, relates, to, circumstances, since, the, aim, of, rhetoric, is, to, be, persuasive, the, level, to, which, the, rhetoric, in, question, persuades, its, audience, is, what, must, be, analyzed, and, later, criticized, in, determining, the, extent, to, which, a, text, is, persuasive, one, may, explore, the, text, s, relationship, with, its, audience, purpose, ethics, argument, evidence, arrangement, delivery, and, style, in, his, rhetorical, criticism, a, study, in, method, edwin, black, states, it, is, the, task, of, criticism, not, to, measure, discourses, dogmatically, against, some, parochial, standard, of, rationality, but, allowing, for, the, immeasurable, wide, range, of, human, experience, to, see, them, as, they, really, are, 131, while, as, they, really, are, is, debatable, rhetorical, critics, explain, texts, and, speeches, by, investigating, their, rhetorical, situation, typically, placing, them, in, a, framework, of, speaker, audience, exchange, the, antithetical, view, places, the, rhetor, at, the, center, of, creating, that, which, is, considered, the, extant, situation, i, e, the, agenda, and, spin, following, the, neo, aristotelian, approaches, to, criticism, scholars, began, to, derive, methods, from, other, disciplines, such, as, history, philosophy, and, the, social, sciences, 249, the, importance, of, critics, personal, judgment, decreased, in, explicit, coverage, while, the, analytical, dimension, of, criticism, began, to, gain, momentum, throughout, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, methodological, pluralism, replaced, the, singular, neo, aristotelian, method, methodological, rhetorical, criticism, is, typically, done, by, deduction, in, which, a, broad, method, is, used, to, examine, a, specific, case, of, rhetoric, these, types, include, by, the, mid, 1980s, the, study, of, rhetorical, criticism, began, to, move, away, from, precise, methodology, towards, conceptual, issues, conceptually, driven, criticism, operates, more, through, abduction, according, to, scholar, james, jasinski, who, argues, that, this, type, of, criticism, can, be, thought, of, as, a, back, and, forth, between, the, text, and, the, concepts, which, are, being, explored, at, the, same, time, the, concepts, remain, works, in, progress, and, understanding, those, terms, develops, through, the, analysis, of, a, text, 256, criticism, is, considered, rhetorical, when, it, focuses, on, the, way, some, types, of, discourse, react, to, situational, exigencies, problems, or, demands, and, constraints, modern, rhetorical, criticism, concerns, how, the, rhetorical, case, or, object, persuades, defines, or, constructs, the, audience, in, modern, terms, rhetoric, includes, but, it, is, not, limited, to, speeches, scientific, discourse, pamphlets, literary, work, works, of, art, and, pictures, contemporary, rhetorical, criticism, has, maintained, aspects, of, early, neo, aristotelian, thinking, through, close, reading, which, attempts, to, explore, the, organization, and, stylistic, structure, of, a, rhetorical, object, using, close, textual, analysis, means, rhetorical, critics, use, the, tools, of, classical, rhetoric, and, literary, analysis, to, evaluate, the, style, and, strategy, used, to, communicate, the, argument, rhetorical, criticism, serves, several, purposes, for, one, it, hopes, to, help, form, or, improve, public, taste, it, helps, educate, audiences, and, develops, them, into, better, judges, of, rhetorical, situations, by, reinforcing, ideas, of, value, morality, and, suitability, rhetorical, criticism, can, thus, contribute, to, the, audience, s, understanding, of, themselves, and, society, according, to, jim, a, kuypers, a, second, purpose, for, performing, criticism, should, be, to, enhance, our, appreciation, and, understanding, e, wish, to, enhance, both, our, own, and, others, understanding, of, the, rhetorical, act, we, wish, to, share, our, insights, with, others, and, to, enhance, their, appreciation, of, the, rhetorical, act, these, are, not, hollow, goals, but, quality, of, life, issues, by, improving, understanding, and, appreciation, the, critic, can, offer, new, and, potentially, exciting, ways, for, others, to, see, the, world, through, understanding, we, also, produce, knowledge, about, human, communication, in, theory, this, should, help, us, to, better, govern, our, interactions, with, others, criticism, is, a, humanizing, activity, in, that, it, explores, and, highlights, qualities, that, make, us, human, 13, rhetoric, is, practiced, by, social, animals, in, a, variety, of, ways, for, example, birds, use, song, various, animals, warn, members, of, their, species, of, danger, chimpanzees, have, the, capacity, to, deceive, through, communicative, keyboard, systems, and, deer, stags, compete, for, the, attention, of, mates, while, these, might, be, understood, as, rhetorical, actions, attempts, at, persuading, through, meaningful, actions, and, utterances, they, can, also, be, seen, as, rhetorical, fundamentals, shared, by, humans, and, animals, the, study, of, animal, rhetoric, has, been, called, biorhetorics, the, self, awareness, required, to, practice, rhetoric, might, be, difficult, to, notice, and, acknowledge, in, some, animals, however, some, animals, are, capable, of, acknowledging, themselves, in, a, mirror, and, therefore, they, might, be, understood, to, be, self, aware, and, engaged, in, rhetoric, when, practicing, some, form, of, language, anthropocentrism, plays, a, significant, role, in, human, animal, relationships, reflecting, and, perpetuating, binaries, in, which, humans, assume, they, are, beings, that, have, extraordinary, qualities, while, they, regard, animals, as, beings, that, lack, those, qualities, this, dualism, is, manifested, in, other, forms, as, well, such, as, reason, and, sense, mind, and, body, ideal, and, phenomenal, in, which, the, first, category, of, each, pair, reason, mind, and, ideal, represents, and, belongs, to, only, humans, by, becoming, aware, of, and, overcoming, these, dualistic, conceptions, including, the, one, between, humans, and, animals, human, knowledge, of, themselves, and, the, world, is, expected, to, become, more, complete, and, holistic, the, relationship, between, humans, and, animals, as, well, as, the, rest, of, the, natural, world,
