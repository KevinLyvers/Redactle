there, is, no, generally, accepted, definition, of, indigenous, peoples, although, in, the, 21st, century, the, focus, has, been, on, self, identification, cultural, difference, from, other, groups, in, a, state, a, special, relationship, with, their, traditional, territory, and, an, experience, of, subjugation, and, discrimination, under, a, dominant, cultural, model, estimates, of, the, population, of, indigenous, peoples, range, from, 250, million, to, 600, million, there, are, some, 5, 000, distinct, indigenous, peoples, spread, across, every, inhabited, climate, zone, and, continent, of, the, world, except, antarctica, most, indigenous, peoples, are, in, a, minority, in, the, state, or, traditional, territory, they, inhabit, and, have, experienced, domination, by, other, groups, especially, non, indigenous, peoples, although, many, indigenous, peoples, have, experienced, colonization, by, settlers, from, european, nations, indigenous, identity, is, not, determined, by, western, colonization, the, rights, of, indigenous, peoples, are, outlined, in, national, legislation, treaties, and, international, law, the, 1989, international, labour, organization, ilo, convention, on, indigenous, and, tribal, peoples, protects, indigenous, peoples, from, discrimination, and, specifies, their, rights, to, development, customary, laws, lands, territories, and, resources, employment, education, and, health, in, 2007, the, united, nations, un, adopted, a, declaration, on, the, rights, of, indigenous, peoples, including, their, rights, to,

organizations, non, government, organizations, governments, indigenous, groups, and, scholars, have, developed, definitions, or, have, declined, to, provide, a, definition, as, a, reference, to, a, group, of, people, the, term, indigenous, was, first, used, by, europeans, to, differentiate, the, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, from, enslaved, africans, the, first, known, use, was, by, sir, thomas, browne, in, 1646, who, wrote, and, although, in, many, parts, thereof, there, be, at, present, swarms, of, negroes, serving, under, the, spaniard, yet, were, they, all, transported, from, africa, since, the, discovery, of, columbus, and, are, not, indigenous, or, proper, natives, of, america, in, the, 1970s, the, term, was, used, as, a, way, of, linking, the, experiences, issues, and, struggles, of, groups, of, colonized, people, across, international, borders, at, this, time, indigenous, people, s, also, began, to, be, used, to, describe, a, legal, category, in, indigenous, law,

in, the, 21st, century, the, concept, of, indigenous, peoples, is, understood, in, a, wider, context, than, only, the, colonial, experience, the, focus, has, been, on, self, identification, as, indigenous, peoples, cultural, difference, from, other, groups, in, a, state, a, special, relationship, with, their, traditional, territory, and, an, experience, of, subjugation, and, discrimination, under, a, dominant, cultural, model, no, definition, of, indigenous, peoples, has, been, adopted, by, a, united, nations, agency, the, secretariat, of, the, permanent, forum, on, indigenous, issues, states, in, the, case, of, the, concept, of, indigenous, peoples, the, prevailing, view, today, is, that, no, formal, universal, definition, of, the, term, is, necessary, given, that, a, single, definition, will, inevitably, be, either, over, or, under, inclusive, making, sense, in, some, societies, but, not, in, others, however, a, number, of, un, agencies, have, provided, statements, of, coverage, for, particular, international, agreements, concerning, indigenous, peoples, or, working, definitions, for, particular, reports, the, international, labour, organization, s, ilo, indigenous, and, tribal, peoples, convention, 1989, ilo, convention, no, 169, states, that, the, convention, covers, peoples, in, independent, countries, who, are, regarded, as, indigenous, on, account, of, their, descent, from, the, populations, which, inhabited, the, country, or, a, geographical, region, to, which, the, country, belongs, at, the, time, of, conquest, or, colonisation, or, the, establishment, of, present, state, boundaries, and, who, irrespective, of, their, legal, status, retain, some, or, all, of, their, own, social, economic, cultural, and, political, institutions, the, convention, also, covers, tribal, peoples, who, are, distinguished, from, indigenous, peoples, and, described, as, tribal, peoples, in, independent, countries, whose, social, cultural, and, economic, conditions, distinguish, them, from, other, sections, of, the, national, community, and, whose, status, is, regulated, wholly, or, partially, by, their, own, customs, or, traditions, or, by, special, laws, or, regulations, the, convention, states, that, self, identification, as, indigenous, or, tribal, is, a, fundamental, criterion, for, determining, the, groups, to, which, the, convention, applies, the, un, declaration, on, the, rights, of, indigenous, peoples, does, not, define, indigenous, peoples, but, affirms, their, right, to, self, determination, including, determining, their, own, identity, the, inter, american, commission, on, human, rights, does, not, provide, a, definition, of, indigenous, peoples, stating, that, such, a, definition, is, not, necessary, for, purposes, of, protecting, their, human, rights, in, determining, coverage, of, indigenous, peoples, the, commission, uses, the, criteria, developed, in, documents, such, as, ilo, convention, no, 169, and, the, united, nations, declaration, on, the, rights, of, indigenous, peoples, the, commission, states, that, self, identification, as, indigenous, is, a, fundamental, criterion, the, world, bank, states,

have, been, displaced, amnesty, international, does, not, provide, a, definition, of, indigenous, peoples, but, states, that, they, can, be, identified, according, to, certain, characteristics, academics, and, other, scholars, have, developed, various, definitions, of, indigenous, peoples, in, 1986, 87, jos, mart, nez, cobo, developed, the, following, working, definition, indigenous, communities, peoples, and, nations, are, those, that, having, a, historical, continuity, with, pre, invasion, and, pre, colonial, societies, that, developed, on, their, territories, consider, themselves, distinct, from, other, sectors, of, the, societies, now, prevailing, in, those, territories, or, parts, of, them, they, form, at, present, non, dominant, sectors, of, society, and, are, determined, to, preserve, develop, and, transmit, to, future, generations, their, ancestral, territories, and, their, ethnic, identity, as, the, basis, of, their, continued, existence, as, peoples, in, accordance, with, their, own, cultural, patterns, social, institutions, and, legal, systems, mart, nez, cobo, states, that, the, following, factors, are, relevant, to, historical, continuity, occupation, of, ancestral, lands, or, at, least, of, part, of, them, common, ancestry, with, the, original, occupants, of, these, lands, cultural, factors, such, as, religion, tribalism, dress, etc, language, residence, in, certain, parts, of, the, country, or, in, certain, regions, of, the, world, and, other, relevant, factors, in, 2004, james, anaya, defined, indigenous, peoples, as, living, descendants, of, pre, invasion, inhabitants, of, lands, now, dominated, by, others, they, are, culturally, distinct, groups, that, find, themselves, engulfed, by, other, settler, societies, born, of, forces, of, empire, and, conquest, in, 2012, tuck, and, yang, propose, a, criterion, based, on, accounts, of, origin, indigenous, peoples, are, those, who, have, creation, stories, not, colonization, stories, about, how, we, they, came, to, be, in, a, particular, place, indeed, how, we, they, came, to, be, a, place, our, their, relationships, to, land, comprise, our, their, epistemologies, ontologies, and, cosmologies, other, views, it, is, sometimes, argued, that, all, africans, are, indigenous, to, africa, all, asians, are, indigenous, to, parts, of, asia, or, that, there, can, be, no, indigenous, peoples, in, countries, which, did, not, experience, large, scale, western, settler, colonialism, many, countries, have, avoided, the, term, indigenous, peoples, or, have, denied, that, indigenous, peoples, exist, in, their, territory, and, have, classified, minorities, who, identify, as, indigenous, in, other, ways, such, as, hill, tribes, in, thailand, scheduled, tribes, in, india, national, minorities, in, china, cultural, minorities, in, the, philippines, isolated, and, alien, peoples, in, indonesia, and, various, other, terms, greek, sources, of, the, classical, period, acknowledge, indigenous, people, whom, they, referred, to, as, pelasgians, ancient, writers, saw, these, people, either, as, the, ancestors, of, the, greeks, or, as, an, earlier, group, of, people, who, inhabited, greece, before, the, greeks, the, disposition, and, precise, identity, of, this, former, group, is, elusive, and, sources, such, as, homer, hesiod, and, herodotus, give, varying, partially, mythological, accounts, dionysius, of, halicarnassus, in, his, book, roman, antiquities, gives, a, synoptic, interpretation, of, the, pelasgians, based, on, the, sources, available, to, him, then, concluding, that, pelasgians, were, greek, greco, roman, society, flourished, between, 330, bce, and, 640, ce, and, undertook, successive, campaigns, of, conquest, that, subsumed, more, than, half, of, the, known, world, of, the, time, but, because, preexisting, populations, within, other, parts, of, europe, at, the, time, of, classical, antiquity, had, more, in, common, culturally, speaking, with, the, greco, roman, world, the, intricacies, involved, in, expansion, across, the, european, frontier, were, not, so, contentious, relative, to, indigenous, issues, in, european, late, antiquity, many, berbers, copts, and, nubians, of, north, africa, converted, to, various, forms, of, christianity, under, roman, rule, although, elements, of, traditional, religious, beliefs, were, retained, following, the, arab, invasions, of, north, africa, in, the, 7th, century, many, berbers, were, enslaved, or, recruited, into, the, army, the, majority, of, berbers, however, remained, nomadic, pastoralists, who, also, engaged, in, trade, as, far, as, sub, saharan, africa, coptic, egyptians, remained, in, possession, of, their, lands, and, many, preserved, their, language, and, christian, religion, by, the, 10th, century, however, the, majority, of, the, population, of, north, africa, spoke, arabic, and, practiced, islam, from, 1402, the, guanche, of, the, canary, islands, resisted, spanish, attempts, at, colonization, the, islands, finally, came, under, spanish, control, in, 1496, mohamed, adhikari, has, called, the, conquest, of,

slaves, expanded, sharply, in, the, 17th, century, with, the, involvement, of, the, french, dutch, and, english, before, declining, in, the, 19th, century, at, least, 12, million, slaves, were, transported, from, africa, the, slave, trade, increased, inter, tribal, warfare, and, stunted, population, growth, and, economic, development, in, the, west, african, interior, indigenous, encounters, with, europeans, increased, during, the, age, of, discovery, the, europeans, were, motivated, by, a, range, of, factors, including, trade, the, exploitation, of, natural, resources, spreading, christianity, and, establishing, strategic, military, bases, colonies, and, settlements, from, 1492, the, arawak, peoples, of, the, caribbean, islands, encountered, spanish, colonizers, initially, led, by, christopher, columbus, the, spanish, enslaved, some, of, the, native, population, and, forced, others, to, work, on, farms, and, gold, mines, in, a, system, of, labor, called, encomienda, spanish, settlements, spread, from, hispaniola, to, puerto, rico, the, bahamas, and, cuba, leading, to, a, severe, decline, in, the, indigenous, populations, from, disease, malnutrition, settler, violence, and, cultural, disruption, in, the, 1520s, the, peoples, of, mesoamerica, encountered, the, spanish, who, entered, their, lands, in, search, of, gold, and, other, resources, some, indigenous, peoples, chose, to, ally, with, the, spanish, to, end, aztec, rule, the, spanish, incursions, led, to, the, conquest, of, the, aztec, empire, and, its, fall, the, cempoalans, tlaxcalans, and, other, allies, of, the, spanish, were, given, some, autonomy, but, the, spanish, were, de, facto, rulers, of, mexico, smallpox, devastated, the, indigenous, population, and, aided, the, spanish, conquest, in, 1530, the, spanish, sailed, south, from, panama, to, the, lands, of, the, inca, empire, in, the, west, of, south, america, the, inca, weakened, by, a, smallpox, epidemic, and, civil,

to, promote, trade, preserve, their, autonomy, and, gain, allies, in, conflicts, with, other, native, peoples, however, horses, and, new, weapons, made, inter, tribal, conflicts, more, deadly, and, the, native, population, was, devastated, by, introduced, diseases, native, peoples, also, experienced, losses, from, violent, conflict, with, the, colonists, and, the, progressive, dispossession, of, their, traditional, lands, in, 1492, the, population, of, the, americas, as, a, whole, was, about, 50, to, 100, million, by, 1700, introduced, diseases, had, reduced, the, native, population, by, 90, european, migration, and, transfer, of, slaves, from, africa, reduced, the, native, population, to, a, minority, by, 1800, the, population, of, north, america, comprised, about, 5, million, europeans, and, their, descendants, one, million, africans, and, 600, 000, indigenous, americans, native, populations, also, encountered, new, animals, and, plants, introduced, by, europeans, these, included, pigs, horses, mules, sheep, and, cattle, wheat, barley, rye, oats, grasses, and, grapevines, these, exotic, animals, and, plants, radically, transformed, the, local, environment, and, disrupted, traditional, agriculture, and, hunting, practices, the, indigenous, populations, of, the, pacific, had, increasing, contact, with, europeans, in, the, 18th, century, as, british, french, and, spanish, expeditions, explored, the, region, the, natives, of, tahiti, had, encounters, with, the, expeditions, of, wallis, 1766, bougainville, 1768, cook, 1769, and, many, others, before, being, colonized, by, the, french, the, indigenous, inhabitants, of, the, hawaiian, islands, first, encountered, europeans, in, 1778, when, cook, explored, the, region, following, increasing, contact, with, european, missionaries, traders, and, scientific, expeditions, the, indigenous, population, fell, before, their, lands, were, annexed, by, the, united, states, in, 1893, the, m, ori, of, new, zealand, also, had, sporadic, encounters, with, europeans, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, following, encounters, with, cook, s, exploration, parties, in, 1769, 70, new, zealand, was, visited, by, numerous, european, and, north, american, whaling, sealing, and, trading, ships, from, the, early, 19th, century, christian, missionaries, began, to, settle, new, zealand, eventually, converting, most, of, the, m, ori, population, the, m, ori, population, declined, to, around, 40, of, its, pre, contact, level, during, the, 19th, century, introduced, diseases, were, the, major, factor, new, zealand, became, a, british, crown, colony, in, 1841, the, aboriginal, inhabitants, of, australia, after, brief, encounters, with, european, explorers, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, had, extensive, contact, with, europeans, when, the, continent, was, progressively, colonized, by, the, british, from, 1788, during, colonization, the, aboriginal, people, experienced, depopulation, from, disease, and, settler, violence, dispossession, of, their, land, and, severe, disruption, of, their, traditional, cultures, by, 1850, indigenous, peoples, were, a, minority, in, australia, from, the, 15th, to, the, 19th, centuries, european, powers, used, a, number, of, rationales, for, the, colonization, of, newly, encountered, lands, populated, by, indigenous, peoples, these, included, a, duty, to, spread, the, gospel, to, non, christians, to, bring, civilization, to, barbarian, peoples, a, natural, law, right, to, explore, and, trade, freely, with, other, peoples, and, a, right, to, settle, and, cultivate, uninhabited, or, uncultivated, land, which, they, considered, terra, nullius, no, one, s, land, robert, j, miller, jacinta, ruru, larissa, behrendt, and, tracey, lindberg, argue, that, european, powers, rationalized, their, colonization, of, the, new, world, by, the, discovery, doctrine, which, they, trace, back, to, papal, decrees, authorizing, spain, and, portugal, to, conquer, newly, discovered, non, christian, lands, and, convert, their, populations, to, christianity, kent, mcneil, however, states, while, spain, and, portugal, favoured, discovery, and, papal, grants, because, it, was, generally, in, their, interests, to, do, so, france, and, britain, relied, more, on, symbolic, acts, colonial, charters, and, occupation, benton, and, strauman, argue, that, european, powers, often, adopted, multiple, sometimes, contradictory, legal, rationales, for, their, acquisition, of, territory, as, a, deliberate, strategy, in, defending, their, claims, against, european, rivals, although, the, establishment, of, colonies, throughout, the, world, by, various, european, powers, aimed, to, expand, those, powers, wealth, and, influence, settler, populations, in, some, localities, became, anxious, to, assert, their, own, autonomy, for, example, settler, independence, movements, in, thirteen, of, the, british, american, colonies, were, successful, by, 1783, following, the, american, revolutionary, war, this, resulted, in, the, establishment, of, the, united, states, of, america, as, an, entity, separate, from, the, british, empire, the, united, states, continued, and, expanded, european, colonial, doctrine, through, adopting, a, version, of, the, discovery, doctrine, as, law, in, 1823, with, the, us, supreme, court, case, johnson, v, mcintosh, statements, at, the, johnson, court, case, illuminated, the, united, states, support, for, the, principles, of, the, discovery, doctrine, the, united, states, its, civilized, inhabitants, now, hold, this, country, they, hold, and, assert, in, themselves, the, title, by, which, it, was, acquired, they, maintain, as, all, others, have, maintained, that, discovery, gave, an, exclusive, right, to, extinguish, the, indian, title, of, occupancy, either, by, purchase, or, by, conquest, and, gave, also, a, right, to, such, a, degree, of, sovereignty, as, the, circumstances, of, the, people, would, allow, them, to, exercise, the, character, and, religion, of, its, inhabitants, the, superior, genius, of, europe, ample, compensation, to, the, by, bestowing, on, them, civilization, and, christianity, in, exchange, for, unlimited, independence, estimates, of, the, population, of, indigenous, peoples, range, from, 250, million, to, 600, million, the, united, nations, estimates, that, there, are, over, 370, million, indigenous, people, living, in, over, 90, countries, worldwide, this, would, equate, to, just, fewer, than, 6, of, the, total, world, population, this, includes, at, least, 5, 000, distinct, peoples, as, there, is, no, universally, accepted, definition, of, indigenous, peoples, their, classification, as, such, varies, between, countries, and, organizations, in, the, americas, australia, and, new, zealand, indigenous, status, is, often, applied, unproblematically, to, groups, descended, from, the, peoples, who, lived, there, prior, to, european, settlement, however, in, asia, and, africa, indigenous, status, has, sometimes, been, rejected, by, certain, peoples, denied, by, governments, or, applied, to, peoples, who, may, not, be, considered, indigenous, in, other, contexts, the, concept, of, indigenous, peoples, is, rarely, used, in, europe, where, very, few, indigenous, groups, are, recognized, with, the, exception, of, groups, such, as, the, s, mi, indigenous, societies, range, from, those, who, have, been, significantly, exposed, to, the, colonizing, or, expansionary, activities, of, other, societies, such, as, the, maya, peoples, of, mexico, and, central, america, through, to, those, who, as, yet, remain, in, comparative, isolation, from, any, external, influence, such, as, the, sentinelese, and, jarawa, of, the, andaman, islands, contemporary, distinct, indigenous, groups, survive, in, populations, ranging, from, only, a, few, dozen, to, hundreds, of, thousands, and, more, many, indigenous, populations, have, undergone, a, dramatic, decline, and, even, extinction, and, remain, threatened, in, many, parts, of, the, world, some, have, also, been, assimilated, by, other, populations, or, have, undergone, many, other, changes, in, other, cases, indigenous, populations, are, undergoing, a, recovery, or, expansion, in, numbers, certain, indigenous, societies, survive, even, though, they, may, no, longer, inhabit, their, traditional, lands, owing, to, migration, relocation, forced, resettlement, or, having, been, supplanted, by, other, cultural, groups, in, many, other, respects, the, transformation, of, culture, of, indigenous, groups, is, ongoing, and, includes, permanent, loss, of, language, loss, of, lands, encroachment, on, traditional, territories, and, disruption, in, traditional, ways, of, life, due, to, contamination, and, pollution, of, waters, and, lands, a, wri, report, mentions, that, tenure, secure, indigenous, lands, generates, billions, and, sometimes, trillions, of, dollars, worth, of, benefits, in, the, form, of, carbon, sequestration, reduced, pollution, clean, water, and, more, it, says, that, tenure, secure, indigenous, lands, have, low, deforestation, rates, they, help, to, reduce, ghg, emissions, control, erosion, and, flooding, by, anchoring, soil, and, provide, a, suite, of, other, local, regional, and, global, ecosystem, services, however, many, of, these, communities, find, themselves, on, the, front, lines, of, the, deforestation, crisis, and, their, lives, and, livelihoods, threatened, misconceptions, about, the, historical, relationship, between, indigenous, populations, and, their, landbase, has, informed, some, westerners, view, of, california, s, wild, eden, which, may, influence, policy, decisions, about, the, wilderness, some, academics, assumed, that, the, only, pre, colonial, human, interactions, with, nature, were, as, hunter, gatherers, others, say, that, the, relationship, was, one, of, calculated, tempered, use, of, nature, as, active, agents, of, environmental, change, and, stewardship, they, argue, that, a, view, of, wilderness, as, uninhabited, nature, has, resulted, in, removal, of, indigenous, inhabitants, to, preserve, the, wild, and, that, depriving, the, land, of, traditional, indigenous, practices, such, as, controlled, burns, harvesting, and, seed, scattering, has, yielded, dense, understory, shrubbery, or, tickets, of, young, trees, which, are, inhospitable, to, life, recent, studies, indicate, that, indigenous, peoples, used, land, sustainably, without, causing, substantial, losses, of, biodiversity, for, thousands, of, years, a, goal, is, to, ascertain, an, unbiased, view, of, indigenous, practices, of, resource, management, historical, literature, archaeological, findings, ecological, field, studies, and, native, peoples, cultures, show, indications, that, indigenous, land, management, practices, were, largely, successful, in, promoting, habitat, heterogeneity, increasing, biodiversity, and, maintaining, certain, vegetation, types, sustaining, human, lives, while, conserving, natural, resources, recently, it, has, come, to, light, that, the, deforestation, rate, of, indonesian, rainforests, has, been, far, greater, than, estimated, such, a, rate, could, not, have, been, the, product, of, globalization, as, understood, before, rather, it, seemed, that, ordinary, local, people, dependent, on, these, forests, for, their, livelihoods, are, in, fact, joining, distant, corporations, in, creating, uninhabitable, landscapes, in, eastern, penan, three, categories, of, misrepresentation, are, noticeable, the, molong, concept, is, purely, a, stewardship, notion, of, resource, management, communities, or, individuals, take, ownership, of, specific, trees, maintaining, and, harvesting, from, them, sustainably, over, a, long, period, of, time, some, feel, this, practice, has, been, romanticized, in, environmentalist, writings, landscape, features, and, particularly, their, names, in, local, languages, provided, geographical, and, historical, information, for, penan, people, whereas, in, environmentalist, accounts, it, has, turned, into, a, spiritual, practice, where, trees, and, rivers, represent, forest, spirits, that, are, sacred, to, the, penan, people, a, typical, stereotype, of, some, environmentalists, approach, to, ecological, ethnography, is, to, present, indigenous, knowledge, of, nature, as, valuable, to, the, outside, world, because, of, its, hidden, medicinal, benefits, in, reality, eastern, penan, populations, do, not, identify, a, medicinal, stream, of, knowledge, these, misrepresentations, in, the, narrative, of, indigeneity, and, value, of, indigenous, knowledge, might, have, been, helpful, for, penan, s, people, in, their, struggle, to, protect, their, environment, but, it, might, also, have, disastrous, consequences, what, happens, if, another, case, did, not, fit, in, this, romantic, narrative, or, another, indigenous, knowledge, did, not, seem, beneficial, to, the, outside, world, these, people, were, being, uprooted, in, the, first, place, because, their, communities, did, not, fit, well, with, the,

within, a, given, region, a, comprehensive, survey, is, further, complicated, by, sometimes, contentious, membership, and, identification, in, the, postcolonial, period, the, concept, of, specific, indigenous, peoples, within, the, african, continent, has, gained, wider, acceptance, although, not, without, controversy, the, highly, diverse, and, numerous, ethnic, groups, that, comprise, most, modern, independent, african, states, contain, within, them, various, peoples, whose, situation, cultures, and, pastoralist, or, hunter, gatherer, lifestyles, are, generally, marginalized, and, set, apart, from, the, dominant, political, and, economic, structures, of, the, nation, since, the, late, 20th, century, these, peoples, have, increasingly, sought, recognition, of, their, rights, as, distinct, indigenous, peoples, in, both, national, and, international, contexts, though, the, vast, majority, of, african, peoples, are, indigenous, in, the, sense, that, they, originate, from, that, continent, in, practice, identity, as, an, indigenous, people, per, the, modern, definition, is, more, restrictive, and, certainly, not, every, african, ethnic, group, claims, identification, under, these, terms, groups, and, communities, who, do, claim, this, recognition, are, those, who, by, a, variety, of, historical, and, environmental, circumstances, have, been, placed, outside, of, the, dominant, state, systems, and, whose, traditional, practices, and, land, claims, often, come, into, conflict, with, the, objectives, and, policies, implemented, by, governments, companies, and, surrounding, dominant, societies, the, indigenous, peoples, of, north, africa, predominantly, comprise, the, berbers, in, the, maghreb, and, the, copts, and, nubians, in, the, nile, valley, the, vast, majority, of, them, have, been, arabized, after, the, islamic, conquests, under, the, rashidun, and, umayyad, caliphates, indigenous, peoples, of, the, americas, are, broadly, recognized, as, being,

colonization, of, the, americas, on, indigenous, communities, have, been, in, general, quite, severe, with, many, authorities, estimating, ranges, of, significant, population, decline, primarily, due, to, disease, land, theft, and, violence, several, peoples, have, become, extinct, or, very, nearly, so, but, there, are, and, have, been, many, thriving, and, resilient, indigenous, nations, and,

indigenous, populations, who, inhabited, the, country, or, region, upon, invasion, colonization, or, establishment, of, state, frontiers, distinctive, social, economic, and, cultural, institutions, thus, indigenous, peoples, of, russia, such, as, sakha, komi, karelian, and, others, are, not, considered, as, such, due, to, the, size, of, the, population, more, than, 50, 000, people, and, consequently, they, are, not, the, subjects, of, the, specific, legal, protections, the, russian, government, recognizes, only, 40, ethnic, groups, as, indigenous, peoples, even, though, there, are, 30, other, groups, to, be, counted, as, such, the, reason, of, nonrecognition, is, the, size, of, the, population, and, relatively, late, advent, to, their, current, regions, thus, indigenous,

concerns, associated, with, their, status, and, interaction, with, other, cultural, groups, as, well, as, changes, in, their, inhabited, environment, some, challenges, are, specific, to, particular, groups, however, other, challenges, are, commonly, experienced, these, issues, include, cultural, and, linguistic, preservation, land, rights, ownership, and, exploitation, of, natural, resources, political, determination, and, autonomy, environmental, degradation, and, incursion, poverty, health, and, discrimination, the, interactions, between, indigenous, and, non, indigenous, societies, throughout, history, and, contemporarily, have, been, complex, ranging, from, outright, conflict, and, subjugation, to, some, degree, of, mutual, benefit, and, cultural, transfer, a, particular, aspect, of, anthropological, study, involves, investigation, into, the, ramifications, of, what, is, termed, first, contact, the, study, of, what, occurs, when, two, cultures, first, encounter, one, another, the, situation, can, be, further, confused, when, there, is, a, complicated, or, contested, history, of, migration, and, population, of, a, given, region, which, can, give, rise, to, disputes, about, primacy, and, ownership, of, the, land, and, resources, wherever, indigenous, cultural, identity, is, asserted, common, societal, issues, and, concerns, arise, these, concerns, are, often, not, unique, to, indigenous, groups, despite, the, diversity, of, indigenous, peoples, they, share, common, problems, and, issues, in, dealing, with, the, prevailing, or, invading, society, they, are, generally, concerned, that, the, cultures, and, lands, of, indigenous, peoples, are, being, lost, and, that, indigenous, peoples, suffer, both, discrimination, and, pressure, to, assimilate, into, the, surrounding, or, colonizing, societies, this, is, borne, out, by, the, fact, that, the, lands, and, cultures, of, nearly, all, of, the, peoples, listed, at, the, end, of, this, article, are, under, threat, notable, exceptions, are, the, sakha, and, komi, peoples, two, northern, indigenous, peoples, of, russia, who, now, control, their, own, autonomous, republics, within,

indigenous, people, and, requested, un, specialized, agencies, to, consider, with, governments, and, indigenous, people, how, they, can, contribute, to, the, success, of, the, decade, of, indigenous, people, commencing, in, december, 1994, as, a, consequence, the, world, health, organization, who, at, its, forty, seventh, world, health, assembly, established, a, core, advisory, group, of, indigenous, representatives, with, special, knowledge, of, the, health, needs, and, resources, of, their, communities, thus, beginning, a, long, term, commitment, to, the, issue, of, the, health, of, indigenous, peoples, the, who, noted, in, 2003, that, statistical, data, on, the, health, status, of, indigenous, peoples, is, scarce, this, is, especially, notable, for, indigenous, peoples, in, africa, asia, and, eastern, europe, but, snapshots, from, various, countries, where, such, statistics, are, available, show, that, indigenous, people, are, in, worse, health, than, the, general, population, in, advanced, and, developing, countries, alike, higher, incidence, of, diabetes, in, some, regions, of, australia, higher, prevalence, of, poor, sanitation, and, lack, of, safe, water,

health, issue, including, hiv, aids, cancer, malaria, cardiovascular, disease, malnutrition, parasitic, infections, and, respiratory, diseases, affecting, indigenous, peoples, at, much, higher, rates, many, causes, of, indigenous, children, s, mortality, could, be, prevented, poorer, health, conditions, amongst, indigenous, peoples, result, from, longstanding, societal, issues, such, as, extreme, poverty, and, racism, but, also, the, intentional, marginalization, and, dispossession, of, indigenous, peoples, by, dominant, non, indigenous, populations, and, societal, structures, indigenous, peoples, have, frequently, been, subjected, to, various, forms, of, racism, and, discrimination, indigenous, peoples, have, been, denoted, as, being, barbaric, primitive, savage, or, uncivilized, these, terms, were, commonly, used, during, the, heyday, of, european, colonial, expansion, and, they, are, still, being, used, by, certain, societies, in, modern, times, during, the, 17th, century, europeans, commonly, labeled, indigenous, peoples, uncivilized, some, philosophers, such, as, thomas, hobbes, 1588, 1679, considered, indigenous, people, mere, savages, others, especially, literary, figures, in, the, 18th, century, popularized, the, concept, of, noble, savages, those, who, were, close, to, the, hobbesian, view, tended, to, believe, that, they, had, a, duty, to, civilize, and, modernize, the, indigenous, survival, international, runs, a, campaign, to, stamp, out, media, portrayals, of, indigenous, peoples, as, primitives, or, savages, after, world, war, i, 1914, 1918, many, europeans, came, to, doubt, the, morality, of, the, means, which, were, used, to, civilize, peoples, at, the, same, time, the, anti, colonial, movement, and, advocates, for, the, rights, of, indigenous, peoples, argued, that, words, such, as, civilized, and, savage, were, products, and, tools, of, colonialism, and, they, also, argued, that, colonialism, itself, was, savagely, destructive, in, the, mid, 20th, century, european, attitudes, began, to, shift, to, the, view, that, indigenous, and, tribal, peoples, are, the, only, peoples, who, should, have, the, right, to, decide, what, should, happen, to, their, ancient, cultures, and, their, ancestral, lands, new, age, and, neopagan, adherents, often, look, to, the, cultures, of, indigenous, peoples, seeking, to, find, ancient, traditional, truths, and, spiritual, practices, to, appropriate, into, their, lifestyles, and, worldviews, at, an, international, level, indigenous, peoples, have, received, increased, recognition, of, their, environmental, rights, since, 2002, but, few, countries, respect, these, rights, in, reality, the, un, declaration, on, the, rights, of, indigenous, peoples, adopted, by, the, general, assembly, in, 2007, established, indigenous, peoples, right, to, self, determination, stating, rights, to, manage, natural, resources, and, cultural, and, intellectual, property, in, countries, where, these, rights, are, recognized, land, titling, and, demarcation, procedures, are, often, put, on, delay, or, leased, out, by, the, state, as, concessions, for, extractive, industries, without, consulting, indigenous, communities, many, in, the, united, states, federal, government, are, in, favor, of, exploiting, oil, reserves, in, the, arctic, national, wildlife, refuge, where, the, gwich, in, indigenous, people, rely, on, herds, of, caribou, oil, drilling, could, destroy, thousands, of, years, of, culture, for, the, gwich, in, on, the, other, hand, some, of, the, inupiat, people, from,

fertilizers, pesticides, and, large, plantation, schemes, have, destroyed, ecosystems, that, indigenous, communities, formerly, depended, on, forcing, resettlement, development, projects, such, as, dam, construction, pipelines, and, resource, extraction, have, displaced, large, numbers, of, indigenous, peoples, often, without, providing, compensation, governments, have, forced, indigenous, peoples, off, of, their, ancestral, lands, in, the, name, of, ecotourism, and, national, park, development, indigenous, women, are, especially, affected, by, land, dispossession, because, they, must, walk, longer, distances, for, water, and, fuel, wood, these, women, also, become, economically, dependent, on, men, when, they, lose, their, livelihoods, indigenous, groups, asserting, their, rights, has, most, often, resulted, in, torture, imprisonment, or, death, the, building, of, dams, can, hurt, indigenous, peoples, by, hurting, the, ecosystems, that, provide, them, water, food, for, example, the, munduruku, people, in, the, amazon, rainforest, are, opposing, the, building, of, tapaj, s, dam, with, the, help, of, greenpeace, most, indigenous, populations, are, already, subject, to, the, deleterious, effects, of, climate, change, climate, change, has, not, only, environmental, but, also, human, rights, and, socioeconomic, implications, for, indigenous, communities, the, world, bank, acknowledges, climate, change, as, an, obstacle, to, millennium, development, goals, notably, the, fight, against, poverty, disease, and, child, mortality, in, addition, to, environmental, sustainability, indigenous, knowledge, is, considered, as, very, important, for, issues, linked, with, sustainability, professor, martin, nakata, is, a, pioneer, in, the, field, of, bringing, indigenous, knowledge, to, mainstream, academics, and, media, through, digital, documentation, of, unique, contributions, by, aboriginal, people, the, western, and, eastern, penan, people, are, two, major, groups, of, indigenous, populations, in, malaysia, the, eastern, penan, are, famous, for, their, resistance, to, loggers, threatening, their, natural, resources, specifically, sago, palms, and, various, fruit, bearing, trees, because, of, the, penan, s, international, fame, environmentalists, often, visited, the, area, to, document, such, happenings, and, learn, more, about, and, from, the, people, there, including, their, perspective, on, the, land, s, invasion, while, indigenous, people, comprise, less, than, 5, of, the, population, they, caretake, for, over, 80, of, global, biodiversity, environmentalists, such, as, davis, and, henley, who, brosius, writes, lumped, all, native, groups, of, malaysia, into, one, homogeneous, group, with, the, same, ideas, and, traditions, and, lacked, dialectical, connections, needed, to, deeply, understand, the, penan, lacked, full, knowledge, of, the, situation, s, specific, weight, to, the, indigenous, peoples, the, two, embarked, on, a, mission, stating, they, wished, to, help, with, conservation, of, the, penan, s, land, resources, but, brosious, states, they, were, among, the, many, who, repackaged, traditional, knowledge, into, something, that, fit, a, western, narrative, and, agenda, and, that, davis, and, henley, romanticized, and, misconstrued, the, traditional, penan, concept, of, molong, meaning, to, preserve, the, penan, marked, trees, for, personal, use, and, to, preserve, them, for, future, harvesting, of, fruits, or, for, materials, another, common, occurrence, is, to, extend, indigenous, knowledge, beyond, its, limits, and, into, unrelated, meanings, that, western, consumers, find, spiritually, profound, this, tendency, of, journalists, extends, beyond, davis, and, henley, it, serves, non, natives, to, add, a, narrative, and, value, beyond, that, which, already, exists, within, the, knowledge, base, of, indigenous, peoples, not, only, do, these, fictionalized, accounts, of, some, indigenous, knowledge, and, traditions, skew, the, beliefs, of, onlookers, but, they, also, contribute, to, cultural, genocide, as, the, actual, spiritual, and, religious, beliefs, of, the, indigenous, people, are, disappeared, and, replaced, with, the, westernized, fiction, africa, eurasia, north, america, oceania, south, america
