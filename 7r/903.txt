a, sniper, is, a, military, or, paramilitary, marksman, who, engages, targets, from, positions, of, concealment, or, at, distances, exceeding, the, target, s, detection, capabilities, snipers, generally, have, specialized, training, and, are, equipped, with, telescopic, sights, modern, snipers, use, high, precision, rifles, and, high, magnification, optics, they, often, also, serve, as, scouts, observers, feeding, tactical, information, back, to, their, units, or, command, headquarters, in, addition, to, long, range, and, high, grade, marksmanship, military, snipers, are, trained, in, a, variety, of, special, operation, techniques, detection, stalking, target, range, estimation, methods, camouflage, tracking, bushcraft, field, craft, infiltration, special, reconnaissance, and, observation, surveillance, and, target, acquisition, snipers, need, to, have, complete, control, of, their, bodies, and, senses, in, order, to, be, effective, they, also, need, to, have, the, skill, set, to, use, data, from, their, scope, and, monitors, to, adjust, their, aim, to, hit, targets, that, are, extremely, far, away, in, training, snipers, are, given, charts, that, they, re, drilled, on, to, ensure, they, can, make, last, minute, calculations, when, they, are, in, the, field, the, name, sniper, comes, from, the, verb, to, snipe, which, originated, in, the, 1770s, among, soldiers, in, british, india, in, reference, to, shooting, snipes, a, wader, that, was, considered, an, extremely, challenging, game, bird, for, hunters, due, to, its, alertness, camouflaging, color, and, erratic, flight, behavior, snipe, hunters, therefore, needed, to, be, stealthy, in, addition, to, being, good, trackers, and, marksmen, in, the, 18th, century, letters, sent, home, by, english, officers, in, india, referred, to, a, day, s, rough, shooting, as, going, sniping, as, it, took, a, skilled, flintlock, sportsman, a, lot, of, patience, and, endurance, to, wing, shoot, a, snipe, in, flight, accomplishing, such, a, shot, was, regarded, as, exceptional, during, the, late, 18th, century, the, term, snipe, shooting, was, simplified, to, sniping, this, evolved, to, the, agent, noun, sniper, first, appearing, by, the, 1820s, the, term, sniper, was, first, attested, militarily, in, 1824, becoming, commonplace, in, the, first, world, war, the, older, term, sharpshooter, comes, from, the, calque, of, german, word, scharfsch, tze, in, use, by, british, newspapers, as, early, as, 1801, the, word, alludes, to, good, marksmanship, itself, descendent, of, the, shooting, competitions, sch, tzenfeste, that, took, place, throughout, the, year, in, munich, in, the, 15th, century, small, companies, of, shooters, sch, tzenf, hnlein, from, the, german, states, and, swiss, cantons, would, form, teams, of, scharfsch, tzen, for, such, popular, competitions, proudly, carrying, flags, depicting, a, crossbow, on, one, side, and, a, target, musket, on, the, other, the, earliest, known, date, for, the, creation, of, a, shooting, club, formed, specifically, for, the, use, of, firearms, comes, from, lucerne, switzerland, where, one, club, has, a, charter, dating, from, 1466, during, the, american, civil, war, confederate, marksmen, equipped, with, the, imported, whitworth, rifles, were, known, as, the, whitworth, sharpshooters, snipers, are, also, called, hunters, in, many, languages, due, to, the, nature, of, the, craft, with, the, hunting, horn, also, being, a, symbol, of, marksmanship, being, called, ca, adores, chasseurs, and, j, ger, other, words, for, sniper, include, franc, tireur, tireur, d, lite, and, atirador, de, escol, completely, different, and, peculiar, is, the, italian, term, cecchino, in, common, use, since, first, world, war, the, term, cecchino, is, derived, from, cecco, beppe, familiarly, and, mockingly, referring, to, the, austro, hungarian, emperor, franz, joseph, i, in, italian, francesco, giuseppe, i, cecco, and, beppe, are, nicknames, for, francesco, and, giuseppe, respectively, different, countries, use, different, military, doctrines, regarding, snipers, in, military, units, settings, and, tactics, a, sniper, s, primary, function, in, modern, warfare, is, to, stay, concealed, at, all, times, and, avoid, detection, then, from, long, range, to, provide, detailed, surveillance, from, a, concealed, position, and, if, necessary, to, reduce, the, enemy, s, combat, ability, by, neutralizing, high, value, targets, especially, officers, and, other, key, personnel, and, in, the, process, cause, disruption, pinning, down, and, demoralizing, the, enemy, typical, sniper, missions, include, managing, intelligence, information, they, gather, during, reconnaissance, target, acquisition, and, impact, feedback, for, air, strikes, and, artillery, assisting, employed, combat, force, with, accurate, fire, support, and, counter, sniper, tactics, killing, enemy, commanders, selecting, targets, of, opportunity, and, even, destruction, of, military, equipment, which, tend, to, require, use, of, anti, materiel, rifles, in, the, larger, calibers, such, as, the, 50, bmg, like, the, barrett, m82, mcmillan, tac, 50, and, denel, ntw, 20, soviet, and, russian, derived, military, doctrines, include, squad, level, snipers, snipers, have, increasingly, been, demonstrated, as, useful, by, us, and, uk, forces, in, the, recent, iraq, campaign, in, a, fire, support, role, to, cover, the, movement, of, infantry, especially, in, urban, areas, military, snipers, from, the, us, uk, and, other, countries, that, adopt, their, military, doctrine, are, typically, deployed, in, two, man, sniper, teams, consisting, of, a, shooter, and, a, spotter, a, common, practice, is, for, a, shooter, and, a, spotter, to, take, turns, to, avoid, eye, fatigue, in, most, recent, combat, operations, occurring, in, large, densely, populated, towns, such, as, fallujah, iraq, two, teams, would, be, deployed, together, to, increase, their, security, and, effectiveness, in, an, urban, environment, a, sniper, team, would, be, armed, with, a, long, range, weapon, and, a, rapid, firing, shorter, ranged, weapon, in, case, of, close, quarter, combat, the, german, doctrine, of, largely, independent, snipers, and, emphasis, on, concealment, developed, during, the, second, world, war, has, been, most, influential, on, modern, sniper, tactics, and, is, currently, used, throughout, western, militaries, examples, are, specialized, camouflage, clothing, concealment, in, terrain, and, emphasis, on, coup, d, il, sniper, rifles, are, classified, as, crew, served, in, the, united, states, military, a, sniper, team, or, sniper, cell, consists, of, a, combination, of, at, least, one, primary, weapon, operator, ie, the, shooter, with, other, support, personnel, and, force, protection, elements, such, as, a, spotter, or, a, flanker, within, the, table, of, organization, and, equipment, for, both, the, united, states, army, and, marine, corps, the, shooter, does, not, operate, alone, but, has, a, backup, shooter, trained, to, fulfill, multiple, roles, in, addition, to, being, sniper, qualified, in, the, operation, of, the, main, weapon, the, shooter, focuses, mainly, on, firing, the, shot, while, the, spotter, assists, in, observation, of, targets, accounts, for, atmospheric, conditions, and, handles, ancillary, tasks, as, immediate, security, of, their, location, communication, with, other, parties, e, g, directing, artillery, fire, and, close, air, support, a, flanker, is, an, extra, teammate, who, is, tasked, to, act, as, a, sentry, observing, areas, not, immediately, visible, to, the, sniper, and, spotter, assisting, with, the, team, s, rear, security, and, perimeter, defense, and, therefore, are, usually, armed, with, a, faster, firing, weapon, such, as, an, assault, rifle, battle, rifle, or, designated, marksman, rifle, both, the, spotter, and, flanker, carry, additional, ammunition, and, associated, equipment, the, spotter, is, responsible, for, detecting, identifying, and, assigning, priority, of, targets, for, the, shooter, as, well, as, assessing, the, outcome, of, the, shot, using, a, spotting, scope, and, or, a, rangefinder, the, spotter, will, predict, the, external, ballistics, and, read, the, wind, speed, using, an, anemometer, or, physical, indicators, like, the, mirage, caused, by, ground, heat, also, in, conjunction, with, the, shooter, the, spotter, will, calculate, the, distance, shooting, angle, slant, range, mil, related, correction, interference, by, atmospheric, factors, and, the, required, leads, for, moving, targets, it, is, not, unusual, for, the, spotter, to, be, equipped, with, a, ballistic, table, a, notebook, or, a, tablet, computer, specifically, for, performing, these, calculations, law, enforcement, snipers, commonly, called, police, snipers, and, military, snipers, differ, in, many, ways, including, their, areas, of, operation, and, tactics, a, police, sharpshooter, is, part, of, a, police, operation, and, usually, takes, part, in, relatively, short, missions, police, forces, typically, deploy, such, sharpshooters, in, hostage, scenarios, this, differs, from, a, military, sniper, who, operates, as, part, of, a, larger, army, engaged, in, warfare, sometimes, as, part, of, a, swat, team, police, snipers, are, deployed, alongside, negotiators, and, an, assault, team, trained, for, close, quarters, combat, as, policemen, they, are, trained, to, shoot, only, as, a, last, resort, when, there, is, a, direct, threat, to, life, the, police, sharpshooter, has, a, well, known, rule, be, prepared, to, take, a, life, to, save, a, life, police, snipers, typically, operate, at, much, shorter, ranges, than, military, snipers, generally, under, 100, meters, 109, yd, and, sometimes, even, less, than, 50, meters, 55, yd, both, types, of, snipers, do, make, difficult, shots, under, pressure, and, often, perform, one, shot, kills, police, units, that, are, unequipped, for, tactical, operations, may, rely, on, a, specialized, swat, team, which, may, have, a, dedicated, sniper, some, police, sniper, operations, begin, with, military, assistance, police, snipers, placed, in, vantage, points, such, as, high, buildings, can, provide, security, for, events, in, one, high, profile, incident, commonly, referred, to, as, the, shot, seen, around, the, world, due, to, going, viral, online, mike, plumb, a, swat, sniper, in, columbus, ohio, prevented, a, suicide, by, shooting, a, revolver, out, of, the, individual, s, hand, leaving, him, unharmed, the, need, for, specialized, training, for, police, sharpshooters, was, made, apparent, in, 1972, during, the, munich, massacre, when, the, german, police, could, not, deploy, specialized, personnel, or, equipment, during, the, standoff, at, the, airport, in, the, closing, phase, of, the, crisis, and, consequently, all, of, the, israeli, hostages, were, killed, while, the, german, army, did, have, snipers, in, 1972, the, use, of, army, snipers, in, the, scenario, was, impossible, due, to, the, german, constitution, s, explicit, prohibition, of, the, use, of, the, military, in, domestic, matters, this, lack, of, trained, snipers, who, could, be, used, in, civilian, roles, was, later, addressed, with, the, founding, of, the, specialized, police, counter, terrorist, unit, gsg, 9, the, longest, confirmed, sniper, kill, in, combat, was, achieved, by, an, undisclosed, member, of, the, security, service, of, ukraine, in, november, 2023, hitting, a, russian, soldier, at, a, distance, of, 3, 800, m, 4, 156, yd, during, the, russian, invasion, of, ukraine, the, previous, record, holder, was, a, member, of, the, canadian, jtf2, special, forces, who, in, june, 2017, achieved, a, hit, at, a, distance, of, 3, 540, m, 3, 871, yd, in, november, 2009, craig, harrison, a, corporal, of, horse, coh, in, the, blues, and, royals, rhg, d, of, the, british, army, struck, two, taliban, machine, gunners, consecutively, south, of, musa, qala, in, helmand, province, in, afghanistan, at, a, range, of, 2, 475, m, 2, 707, yd, or, 1, 54, miles, using, a, l115a3, long, range, rifle, the, qtu, lapua, external, ballistics, software, using, continuous, doppler, drag, coefficient, c, d, data, provided, by, lapua, predicts, that, such, shots, traveling, 2, 475, m, 2, 707, yd, would, likely, have, struck, their, targets, after, nearly, 6, 0, seconds, of, flight, time, having, lost, 93, of, their, kinetic, energy, retaining, 255, m, s, 840, ft, s, of, their, original, 936, m, s, 3, 070, ft, s, velocity, and, having, dropped, 121, 39, m, 398, ft, 3, in, or, 2, 8, from, the, original, bore, line, due, to, the, extreme, distances, and, travel, time, involved, even, a, light, cross, breeze, of, 2, 7, m, s, 6, 0, mph, would, have, diverted, such, shots, 9, 2, m, 360, in, off, target, which, would, have, required, compensation, the, calculation, assumes, a, flat, fire, scenario, a, situation, where, the, shooting, and, target, positions, are, at, equal, elevation, using, british, military, custom, high, pressure, 338, lapua, magnum, cartridges, loaded, with, 16, 2, g, 250, gr, lapua, lockbase, b408, bullets, fired, at, 936, m, s, 3, 071, ft, s, muzzle, velocity, under, the, following, on, site, average, atmospheric, conditions, barometric, pressure, 1, 019, hpa, 30, 1, inhg, at, sea, level, equivalent, or, 899, hpa, 26, 5, inhg, on, site, humidity, 25, 9, and, temperature, 15, c, 59, f, in, the, region, for, november, 2009, resulting, in, an, air, density, 1, 0854, kg, m, 3, at, the, 1, 043, m, 3, 422, ft, elevation, of, musa, qala, harrison, mentions, in, reports, that, the, environmental, conditions, were, perfect, for, long, range, shooting, no, wind, mild, weather, clear, visibility, in, a, bbc, interview, harrison, reported, it, took, about, nine, shots, for, him, and, his, spotter, to, initially, range, the, target, successfully, before, the, development, of, rifling, firearms, were, smoothbore, and, inaccurate, over, long, distance, barrel, rifling, was, invented, at, the, end, of, the, fifteenth, century, but, was, only, employed, in, large, cannons, over, time, rifling, along, with, other, gunnery, advances, has, increased, the, performance, of, modern, firearms, marksmanship, later, sharpshooting, or, sniping, occurred, as, early, as, the, mid, eighteenth, century, for, instance, in, the, 1752, appin, murder, colin, roy, campbell, of, glenure, was, shot, in, the, back, near, duror, by, an, unknown, sniper, most, likely, from, within, clan, stewart, of, appin, in, retaliation, for, campbell, s, role, in, an, early, version, of, the, highland, clearances, the, mass, eviction, of, stewart, clansmen, and, their, replacement, by, members, of, clan, campbell, hunting, terminology, was, quickly, adapted, to, warfare, by, british, soldiers, in, a, 1772, letter, a, soldier, described, enemies, firing, very, accurately, in, erecting, our, batteries, the, people, frequently, play, tricks, by, putting, a, hat, with, a, cockade, in, it, on, a, spunge, staff, which, the, enemy, fire, at, and, often, hit, to, the, diversion, of, the, soldiery, who, humorously, call, it, sniping, and, watch, the, flash, to, return, the, fire, on, 11, september, 1777, during, the, battle, of, brandywine, british, captain, patrick, ferguson, had, a, tall, distinguished, american, officer, in, his, rifle, s, iron, sights, ferguson, did, not, take, the, shot, as, he, considered, shooting, anyone, in, the, back, dishonourable, only, later, did, ferguson, learn, that, george, washington, had, been, on, the, battlefield, that, day, at, the, battles, of, saratoga, morgan, s, riflemen, hid, in, the, trees, and, used, early, model, rifles, to, shoot, senior, british, officers, most, notably, timothy, murphy, shot, and, killed, general, simon, fraser, of, balnain, on, 7, october, 1777, at, a, distance, of, about, 400, yards, in, early, 1800, colonel, coote, manningham, and, lieutenant, colonel, the, hon, william, stewart, of, the, british, army, proposed, using, what, they, had, learned, while, leading, light, infantry, to, establish, a, special, unit, of, marksmen, subsequently, raised, as, the, experimental, corps, of, riflemen, they, were, armed, with, the, formidable, baker, rifle, rather, than, the, inaccurate, smoothbore, muskets, used, by, most, troops, at, that, time, through, the, combination, of, a, leather, wad, and, tight, grooves, on, the, inside, of, the, barrel, rifling, this, weapon, was, far, more, accurate, though, slower, to, load, on, 25, august, 1800, three, companies, under, the, command, of, stewart, spearheaded, an, amphibious, landing, at, ferrol, spain, the, term, sharp, shooter, was, in, use, in, british, newspapers, as, early, as, 1801, in, the, edinburgh, advertiser, 23, june, 1801, can, be, found, the, following, quote, in, a, piece, about, the, north, british, militia, this, regiment, has, several, field, pieces, and, two, companies, of, sharp, shooters, which, are, very, necessary, in, the, modern, stile, of, war, the, term, appears, even, earlier, around, 1781, in, continental, europe, translated, from, the, german, scharfsch, tze, scouts, in, the, ashanti, army, were, made, up, of, professional, hunters, who, used, their, skill, as, marksmen, to, snipe, at, advancing, enemy, forces, in, response, to, detection, by, the, enemy, they, executed, this, often, from, a, perch, high, in, trees, the, whitworth, rifle, was, arguably, the, first, long, range, sniper, rifle, in, the, world, a, muzzleloader, designed, by, sir, joseph, whitworth, a, prominent, british, engineer, it, used, polygonal, rifling, instead, which, meant, that, the, projectile, did, not, have, to, bite, into, grooves, as, was, done, with, conventional, rifling, the, whitworth, rifle, was, far, more, accurate, than, the, pattern, 1853, enfield, which, had, shown, some, weaknesses, during, the, recent, crimean, war, at, trials, in, 1857, which, tested, the, accuracy, and, range, of, both, weapons, whitworth, s, design, outperformed, the, enfield, at, a, rate, of, about, three, to, one, the, whitworth, rifle, was, capable, of, hitting, the, target, at, a, range, of, 2, 000, yards, whereas, the, enfield, could, only, manage, it, at, 1, 400, yards, during, the, crimean, war, the, first, optical, sights, were, designed, to, fit, onto, rifles, much, of, this, pioneering, work, was, the, brainchild, of, colonel, d, davidson, using, optical, sights, produced, by, chance, brothers, of, birmingham, this, allowed, a, marksman, to, observe, and, target, objects, more, accurately, at, a, greater, distance, than, ever, before, the, telescopic, sight, or, scope, was, originally, fixed, and, could, not, be, adjusted, which, therefore, limited, its, range, despite, its, success, at, the, trials, the, rifle, was, not, adopted, by, the, british, army, however, the, whitworth, rifle, company, was, able, to, sell, the, weapon, to, the, french, army, and, also, to, the, confederacy, during, the, american, civil, war, where, both, the, union, and, confederate, armies, employed, sharpshooters, the, most, notable, incident, was, during, the, battle, of, spotsylvania, court, house, where, on, 9, may, 1864, union, general, john, sedgwick, was, killed, by, a, confederate, whitworth, sharpshooter, at, a, range, of, about, 1, 000, yards, 910, meters, after, saying, the, enemy, couldn, t, hit, an, elephant, at, this, distance, during, the, boer, war, the, latest, breech, loading, rifled, guns, with, magazines, and, smokeless, powder, were, used, by, both, sides, the, british, were, equipped, with, the, lee, metford, rifle, while, the, boers, had, received, the, latest, mauser, rifles, from, germany, in, the, open, terrain, of, south, africa, the, marksmen, were, a, crucial, component, to, the, outcome, of, the, battle, the, first, british, sniper, unit, began, life, as, the, lovat, scouts, a, scottish, highland, regiment, formed, in, 1899, that, earned, high, praise, during, the, second, boer, war, 1899, 1902, the, unit, was, formed, by, lord, lovat, and, reported, to, an, american, major, frederick, russell, burnham, the, british, army, chief, of, scouts, under, lord, roberts, burnham, fittingly, described, these, scouts, as, half, wolf, and, half, jackrabbit, just, like, their, boer, scout, opponents, these, scouts, were, well, practised, in, the, arts, of, marksmanship, field, craft, map, reading, observation, and, military, tactics, they, were, skilled, woodsmen, and, practitioners, of, discretion, he, who, shoots, and, runs, away, lives, to, shoot, another, day, they, were, also, the, first, known, military, unit, to, wear, a, ghillie, suit, hesketh, hesketh, prichard, said, of, them, that, keener, men, never, lived, and, that, burnham, was, the, greatest, scout, of, our, time, burnham, distinguished, himself, in, wars, in, south, africa, rhodesia, and, in, arizona, fighting, the, apaches, and, his, definitive, work, scouting, on, two, continents, provides, a, dramatic, and, enlightening, picture, of, what, a, sniper, was, at, the, time, and, how, he, operated, after, the, war, this, regiment, went, on, to, formally, become, the, first, official, sniper, unit, then, better, known, as, sharpshooters, during, world, war, i, snipers, appeared, as, deadly, sharpshooters, in, the, trenches, at, the, start, of, the, war, only, imperial, germany, had, troops, that, were, issued, scoped, sniper, rifles, although, sharpshooters, existed, on, all, sides, the, germans, specially, equipped, some, of, their, soldiers, with, scoped, rifles, that, could, pick, off, enemy, soldiers, showing, their, heads, out, of, their, trench, at, first, the, french, and, british, believed, such, hits, to, be, coincidental, hits, until, the, german, scoped, rifles, were, discovered, during, world, war, i, the, german, army, received, a, reputation, for, the, deadliness, and, efficiency, of, its, snipers, partly, because, of, the, high, quality, lenses, that, german, industry, could, manufacture, during, the, first, world, war, the, static, movement, of, trench, warfare, and, a, need, for, protection, from, snipers, created, a, requirement, for, loopholes, both, for, discharging, firearms, and, for, observation, often, a, steel, plate, was, used, with, a, key, hole, which, had, a, rotating, piece, to, cover, the, loophole, when, not, in, use, soon, the, british, army, began, to, train, their, own, snipers, in, specialized, sniper, schools, major, hesketh, hesketh, prichard, was, given, formal, permission, to, begin, sniper, training, in, 1915, and, founded, the, first, army, school, of, sniping, observation, and, scouting, at, linghem, in, france, in, 1916, starting, with, a, first, class, of, only, six, in, time, he, was, able, to, lecture, to, large, numbers, of, soldiers, from, different, allied, nations, proudly, proclaiming, in, a, letter, that, his, school, was, turning, out, snipers, at, three, times, the, rate, of, any, such, other, school, in, the, world, he, also, devised, a, metal, armoured, double, loophole, that, would, protect, the, sniper, observer, from, enemy, fire, the, front, loophole, was, fixed, but, the, rear, was, housed, in, a, metal, shutter, sliding, in, grooves, only, when, the, two, loopholes, were, lined, up, a, one, to, twenty, chance, could, an, enemy, shoot, between, them, another, innovation, was, the, use, of, a, dummy, head, to, find, the, location, of, an, enemy, sniper, the, papier, m, ch, figures, were, painted, to, resemble, soldiers, to, draw, sniper, fire, some, were, equipped, with, rubber, surgical, tubing, so, the, dummy, could, smoke, a, cigarette, and, thus, appear, realistic, holes, punched, in, the, dummy, by, enemy, sniper, bullets, then, could, be, used, for, triangulation, purposes, to, determine, the, position, of, the, enemy, sniper, who, could, then, be, attacked, with, artillery, fire, he, developed, many, of, the, modern, techniques, in, sniping, including, the, use, of, spotting, scopes, and, working, in, pairs, and, using, kim, s, game, to, train, observational, skills, in, 1920, he, wrote, his, account, of, his, war, time, activities, in, his, book, sniping, in, france, to, which, reference, is, still, made, by, modern, authors, regarding, the, subject, the, main, sniper, rifles, used, during, the, first, world, war, were, the, german, mauser, gewehr, 98, the, british, pattern, 1914, enfield, and, lee, enfield, smle, mk, iii, the, canadian, ross, rifle, the, american, m1903, springfield, the, italian, m1891, carcano, and, the, russian, m1891, mosin, nagant, during, the, interbellum, most, nations, dropped, their, specialized, sniper, units, notably, the, germans, effectiveness, and, dangers, of, snipers, once, again, came, to, the, fore, during, the, spanish, civil, war, the, only, nation, that, had, specially, trained, sniper, units, during, the, 1930s, was, the, soviet, union, soviet, snipers, were, trained, in, their, skills, as, marksmen, in, using, the, terrain, to, hide, themselves, from, the, enemy, and, the, ability, to, work, alongside, regular, forces, this, made, the, soviet, sniper, training, focus, more, on, normal, combat, situations, than, those, of, other, nations, snipers, reappeared, as, important, factors, on, the, battlefield, from, the, first, campaign, of, world, war, ii, during, germany, s, 1940, campaigns, lone, well, hidden, french, and, british, snipers, were, able, to, halt, the, german, advance, for, a, considerable, amount, of, time, for, example, during, the, pursuit, to, dunkirk, british, snipers, were, able, to, significantly, delay, the, german, infantry, s, advance, this, prompted, the, british, once, again, to, increase, training, of, specialized, sniper, units, apart, from, marksmanship, british, snipers, were, trained, to, blend, in, with, the, environment, often, by, using, special, camouflage, clothing, for, concealment, however, because, the, british, army, offered, sniper, training, exclusively, to, officers, and, non, commissioned, officers, the, resulting, small, number, of, trained, snipers, in, combat, units, considerably, reduced, their, overall, effectiveness, during, the, winter, war, finnish, snipers, took, a, heavy, toll, of, the, invading, red, army, simo, h, yh, is, credited, with, 505, confirmed, kills, most, with, the, finnish, version, of, the, iron, sighted, bolt, action, mosin, nagant, the, most, successful, german, sniper, was, matth, us, hetzenauer, with, 345, confirmed, kills, in, germany, confirmed, kills, are, only, valid, in, the, presence, of, an, officer, so, hetzenauer, s, estimated, kills, are, many, times, higher, his, longest, confirmed, kill, was, reported, at, 1, 100, meters, 1, 200, yards, hetzenauer, received, the, knight, s, cross, of, the, iron, cross, on, 17, april, 1945, one, of, the, best, known, battles, involving, snipers, and, the, battle, that, made, the, germans, reinstate, their, specialized, sniper, training, was, the, battle, of, stalingrad, their, defensive, position, inside, a, city, filled, with, rubble, meant, that, soviet, snipers, were, able, to, inflict, significant, casualties, on, the, wehrmacht, troops, because, of, the, nature, of, fighting, in, city, rubble, snipers, were, very, hard, to, spot, and, seriously, dented, the, morale, of, the, german, attackers, the, best, known, of, these, snipers, was, probably, vasily, zaytsev, featured, in, the, novel, war, of, the, rats, and, the, subsequent, film, enemy, at, the, gates, german, scharfsch, tzen, were, prepared, before, the, war, equipped, with, karabiner, 98, and, later, gewehr, 43, rifles, but, there, were, often, not, enough, of, these, weapons, available, and, as, such, some, were, armed, with, captured, scoped, mosin, nagant, 1891, 30, svt, czech, mauser, rifles, or, scoped, gewehr, 98, from, ww1, the, wehrmacht, re, established, its, sniper, training, in, 1942, drastically, increasing, the, number, of, snipers, per, unit, with, the, creation, of, an, additional, 31, sniper, training, companies, by, 1944, german, snipers, were, at, the, time, the, only, snipers, in, the, world, issued, with, purpose, manufactured, sniping, ammunition, known, as, the, effect, firing, ss, round, the, effect, firing, ss, round, featured, an, extra, carefully, measured, propellant, charge, and, seated, a, heavy, 12, 8, gram, 198, gr, full, metal, jacketed, boat, tail, projectile, of, match, grade, build, quality, lacking, usual, features, such, as, a, seating, ring, to, improve, the, already, high, ballistic, coefficient, of, 584, g1, further, for, aiming, optics, german, snipers, used, the, zeiss, zielvier, 4x, zf39, telescopic, sight, which, had, bullet, drop, compensation, in, 50, m, increments, for, ranges, from, 100, m, up, to, 800, m, or, in, some, variations, from, 100, m, up, to, 1000, m, or, 1200, m, there, were, zf42, zielfernrohr, 43, zf, 4, zeiss, zielsechs, 6x, zeiss, zielacht, 8x, and, other, telescopic, sights, by, various, manufacturers, like, the, ajack, 4x, hensoldt, dialytan, 4x, and, kahles, heliavier, 4x, with, similar, features, employed, on, german, sniper, rifles, several, different, mountings, produced, by, various, manufacturers, were, used, for, mounting, aiming, optics, to, the, rifles, in, february, 1945, the, zielger, t, 1229, active, infrared, aiming, device, was, issued, for, night, sniping, with, the, stg, 44, assault, rifle, a, total, of, 428, 335, individuals, received, red, army, sniper, training, including, soviet, and, non, soviet, partisans, with, 9, 534, receiving, the, sniping, higher, qualification, during, world, war, two, six, month, training, courses, for, women, alone, trained, nearly, 55, 000, snipers, of, which, more, than, two, thousand, later, served, in, the, army, on, average, there, was, at, least, one, sniper, in, an, infantry, platoon, and, one, in, every, reconnaissance, platoon, including, in, tank, and, even, artillery, units, some, used, the, ptrd, anti, tank, rifle, with, an, adapted, scope, as, an, early, example, of, an, anti, materiel, rifle, in, the, united, states, armed, forces, sniper, training, was, only, very, elementary, and, was, mainly, concerned, with, being, able, to, hit, targets, over, long, distances, snipers, were, required, to, be, able, to, hit, a, body, over, 400, meters, away, and, a, head, over, 200, meters, away, there, was, almost, no, instruction, in, blending, into, the, environment, sniper, training, varied, from, place, to, place, resulting, in, wide, variation, in, the, qualities, of, snipers, the, main, reason, the, us, did, not, extend, sniper, training, beyond, long, range, shooting, was, the, limited, deployment, of, us, soldiers, until, the, normandy, invasion, during, the, campaigns, in, north, africa, and, italy, most, fighting, occurred, in, arid, and, mountainous, regions, where, the, potential, for, concealment, was, limited, in, contrast, to, western, and, central, europe, the, u, s, army, s, lack, of, familiarity, with, sniping, tactics, proved, disastrous, in, normandy, and, the, campaign, in, western, europe, where, they, encountered, well, trained, german, snipers, in, normandy, german, snipers, remained, hidden, in, the, dense, vegetation, and, were, able, to, encircle, american, units, firing, at, them, from, all, sides, the, american, and, british, forces, were, surprised, by, how, near, the, german, snipers, could, approach, in, safety, and, attack, them, as, well, as, by, their, ability, to, hit, targets, at, up, to, 1, 000m, a, notable, mistake, made, by, inexperienced, american, soldiers, was, to, lie, down, and, wait, when, targeted, by, german, snipers, allowing, the, snipers, to, pick, them, off, one, after, another, german, snipers, often, infiltrated, allied, lines, and, sometimes, when, the, front, lines, moved, they, continued, to, fight, from, their, sniping, positions, refusing, to, surrender, until, their, rations, and, munitions, were, exhausted, those, tactics, were, also, a, consequence, of, changes, in, german, enlistment, after, several, years, of, war, and, heavy, losses, on, the, eastern, front, the, german, army, was, forced, to, rely, more, heavily, on, enlisting, teenage, soldiers, due, to, lack, of, training, in, more, complex, group, tactics, and, thanks, to, rifle, training, provided, by, the, hitlerjugend, those, soldiers, were, often, used, as, autonomous, left, behind, snipers, while, an, experienced, sniper, would, take, a, few, lethal, shots, and, retreat, to, a, safer, position, those, young, boys, due, both, to, a, disregard, for, their, own, safety, and, to, lack, of, tactical, experience, would, frequently, remain, in, a, concealed, position, and, fight, until, they, ran, out, of, ammunition, or, were, killed, or, wounded, while, this, tactic, generally, ended, in, the, demise, of, the, sniper, giving, rise, to, the, nickname, suicide, boys, that, was, given, to, those, soldiers, this, irrational, behavior, proved, quite, disruptive, to, the, allied, forces, progress, after, world, war, ii, many, elements, of, german, sniper, training, and, doctrine, were, copied, by, other, countries, in, the, pacific, war, the, empire, of, japan, trained, snipers, in, the, jungles, of, asia, and, the, pacific, islands, snipers, posed, a, serious, threat, to, u, s, british, and, commonwealth, troops, japanese, snipers, were, specially, trained, to, use, the, environment, to, conceal, themselves, japanese, snipers, used, foliage, on, their, uniforms, and, dug, well, concealed, hide, outs, that, were, often, connected, with, small, trenches, there, was, no, need, for, long, range, accuracy, because, most, combat, in, the, jungle, took, place, within, a, few, hundred, meters, japanese, snipers, were, known, for, their, patience, and, ability, to, remain, hidden, for, long, periods, they, almost, never, left, their, carefully, camouflaged, hiding, spots, this, meant, that, whenever, a, sniper, was, in, the, area, the, location, of, the, sniper, could, be, determined, after, the, sniper, had, fired, a, few, shots, the, allies, used, their, own, snipers, in, the, pacific, notably, the, u, s, marines, who, used, m1903, springfield, rifles, common, sniper, rifles, used, during, the, second, world, war, include, the, soviet, m1891, 30, mosin, nagant, and, to, a, lesser, extent, the, svt, 40, the, german, mauser, karabiner, 98k, and, gewehr, 43, the, british, lee, enfield, no, 4, and, pattern, 1914, enfield, the, japanese, arisaka, 97, the, american, m1903a4, springfield, and, m1c, garand, the, italians, trained, few, snipers, and, supplied, them, with, a, scoped, carcano, model, 1891, military, sniper, training, aims, to, teach, a, high, degree, of, proficiency, in, camouflage, and, concealment, stalking, observation, and, map, reading, as, well, as, precision, marksmanship, under, various, operational, conditions, trainees, typically, shoot, thousands, of, rounds, over, a, number, of, weeks, while, learning, these, core, skills, snipers, are, trained, to, squeeze, the, trigger, straight, back, with, the, ball, of, their, finger, to, avoid, jerking, the, gun, sideways, the, most, accurate, position, is, prone, with, a, sandbag, supporting, the, stock, and, the, stock, s, cheek, piece, against, the, cheek, in, the, field, a, bipod, can, be, used, instead, sometimes, a, sling, is, wrapped, around, the, weak, arm, or, both, to, reduce, stock, movement, some, doctrines, train, a, sniper, to, breathe, deeply, before, shooting, then, hold, their, lungs, empty, while, they, line, up, and, take, their, shot, other, doctrines, assert, that, exhausting, the, lungs, results, in, an, accelerated, heart, rate, and, suggest, only, a, partial, exhale, before, firing, some, go, further, teaching, their, snipers, to, shoot, between, heartbeats, to, minimize, barrel, motion, the, key, to, sniping, is, accuracy, which, applies, to, both, the, weapon, and, the, shooter, the, weapon, should, be, able, to, consistently, place, shots, within, tight, tolerances, the, sniper, in, turn, must, use, the, weapon, to, accurately, place, shots, under, varying, conditions, a, sniper, must, have, the, ability, to, accurately, estimate, the, various, factors, that, influence, a, bullet, s, trajectory, and, point, of, impact, such, as, range, to, the, target, wind, direction, wind, velocity, altitude, and, elevation, of, the, sniper, and, the, target, and, ambient, temperature, mistakes, in, estimation, compound, over, distance, and, can, decrease, lethality, or, cause, a, shot, to, miss, completely, snipers, zero, their, weapons, at, a, target, range, or, in, the, field, this, is, the, process, of, adjusting, the, scope, so, that, the, bullets, points, of, impact, are, at, the, point, of, aim, centre, of, scope, or, scope, s, cross, hairs, for, a, specific, distance, a, rifle, and, scope, should, retain, its, zero, as, long, as, possible, under, all, conditions, to, reduce, the, need, to, re, zero, during, missions, a, sandbag, can, serve, as, a, useful, platform, for, shooting, a, sniper, rifle, although, any, soft, surface, such, as, a, rucksack, will, steady, a, rifle, and, contribute, to, consistency, in, particular, bipods, help, when, firing, from, a, prone, position, and, enable, the, firing, position, to, be, sustained, for, an, extended, period, of, time, many, police, and, military, sniper, rifles, come, equipped, with, an, adjustable, bipod, makeshift, bipods, known, as, shooting, sticks, can, be, constructed, from, items, such, as, tree, branches, or, ski, poles, some, military, snipers, use, three, legged, shooting, sticks, servicemen, volunteer, for, the, rigorous, sniper, training, and, are, accepted, on, the, basis, of, their, aptitude, physical, ability, marksmanship, patience, and, mental, stability, military, snipers, may, be, further, trained, as, forward, air, controllers, facs, to, direct, air, strikes, or, forward, observers, fos, to, direct, artillery, or, mortar, fire, from, 2011, the, russian, armed, forces, have, run, newly, developed, sniper, courses, in, military, district, training, centres, in, place, of, the, soviet, practice, of, mainly, squad, sharpshooters, which, were, often, designated, during, initial, training, and, of, whom, only, few, become, snipers, per, se, these, new, army, snipers, are, trained, intensively, for, three, months, for, conscripts, or, longer, for, contract, soldiers, the, training, program, includes, theory, and, practice, of, countersniper, engagements, artillery, spotting, and, coordination, of, air, support, the, first, instructors, are, the, graduates, of, the, solnechnogorsk, sniper, training, centre, the, method, of, sniper, deployment, according, to, the, ministry, of, defence, is, likely, to, be, one, three, platoon, company, at, the, brigade, level, with, one, of, the, platoons, acting, independently, and, the, other, two, supporting, the, battalions, as, needed, the, range, to, the, target, is, measured, or, estimated, as, precisely, as, conditions, permit, and, correct, range, estimation, becomes, absolutely, critical, at, long, ranges, because, a, bullet, travels, with, a, curved, trajectory, and, the, sniper, must, compensate, for, this, by, aiming, higher, at, longer, distances, if, the, exact, distance, is, not, known, the, sniper, may, compensate, incorrectly, and, the, bullet, path, may, be, too, high, or, low, as, an, example, for, a, typical, military, sniping, cartridge, such, as, 7, 62, 51mm, nato, 308, winchester, m118, special, ball, round, this, difference, or, drop, from, 700, to, 800, meters, 770, 870, yd, is, 200, millimetres, 7, 9, in, this, means, that, if, the, sniper, incorrectly, estimated, the, distance, as, 700, meters, when, the, target, was, in, fact, 800, meters, away, the, bullet, will, be, 200, millimeters, lower, than, expected, by, the, time, it, reaches, the, target, laser, rangefinders, may, be, used, and, range, estimation, is, often, the, job, of, both, parties, in, a, team, one, useful, method, of, range, finding, without, a, laser, rangefinder, is, comparing, the, height, of, the, target, or, nearby, objects, to, their, size, on, the, mil, dot, scope, or, taking, a, known, distance, and, using, some, sort, of, measure, utility, poles, fence, posts, to, determine, the, additional, distance, the, average, human, head, is, 150, millimeters, 5, 9, in, in, width, average, human, shoulders, are, 500, millimeters, 20, in, apart, and, the, average, distance, from, a, person, s, pelvis, to, the, top, of, their, head, is, 1, 000, millimeters, 39, in, to, determine, the, range, to, a, target, without, a, laser, rangefinder, the, sniper, may, use, the, mil, dot, reticle, on, a, scope, to, accurately, find, the, range, mil, dots, are, used, like, a, slide, rule, to, measure, the, height, of, a, target, and, if, the, height, is, known, the, range, can, be, as, well, the, height, of, the, target, in, yards, 1000, divided, by, the, height, of, the, target, in, mils, gives, the, range, in, yards, this, is, only, in, general, however, as, both, scope, magnification, 7, 40, and, mil, dot, spacing, change, the, usmc, standard, is, that, 1, mil, that, is, 1, milliradian, equals, 3, 438, moa, minute, of, arc, or, equivalently, minute, of, angle, while, the, us, army, standard, is, 3, 6, moa, chosen, so, as, to, give, a, diameter, of, 1, yard, at, a, distance, of, 1, 000, yards, or, equivalently, a, diameter, of, 1, meter, at, a, range, of, 1, kilometer, many, commercial, manufacturers, use, 3, 5, splitting, the, difference, since, it, is, easier, to, work, with, it, is, important, to, note, that, angular, mil, mil, is, only, an, approximation, of, a, milliradian, and, different, organizations, use, different, approximations, at, longer, ranges, bullet, drop, plays, a, significant, role, in, targeting, the, effect, can, be, estimated, from, a, chart, which, may, be, memorized, or, taped, to, the, rifle, although, some, scopes, come, with, bullet, drop, compensator, bdc, systems, that, only, require, the, range, be, dialed, in, these, are, tuned, to, both, a, specific, class, of, rifle, and, specific, ammunition, every, bullet, type, and, load, will, have, different, ballistics, 308, federal, 175, grain, 11, 3, g, bthp, match, shoots, at, 2, 600, ft, s, 790, m, s, zeroed, at, 100, yards, 100, m, a, 16, 2, moa, adjustment, would, have, to, be, made, to, hit, a, target, at, 600, yards, 500, m, if, the, same, bullet, was, shot, with, 168, grain, 10, 9, g, a, 17, 1, moa, adjustment, would, be, necessary, shooting, uphill, or, downhill, is, confusing, for, many, because, gravity, does, not, act, perpendicular, to, the, direction, the, bullet, is, traveling, thus, gravity, must, be, divided, into, its, component, vectors, only, the, fraction, of, gravity, equal, to, the, cosine, of, the, angle, of, fire, with, respect, to, the, horizon, affects, the, rate, of, fall, of, the, bullet, with, the, remainder, adding, or, subtracting, negligible, velocity, to, the, bullet, along, its, trajectory, to, find, the, correct, zero, the, sniper, multiplies, the, actual, distance, to, the, range, by, this, fraction, and, aims, as, if, the, target, were, that, distance, away, for, example, a, sniper, who, observes, a, target, 500, meters, away, at, a, 45, degree, angle, downhill, would, multiply, the, range, by, the, cosine, of, 45, degrees, which, is, 0, 707, the, resulting, distance, will, be, 353, meters, this, number, is, equal, to, the, horizontal, distance, to, the, target, all, other, values, such, as, windage, time, to, target, impact, velocity, and, energy, will, be, calculated, based, on, the, actual, range, of, 500, meters, recently, a, small, device, known, as, a, cosine, indicator, has, been, developed, this, device, is, clamped, to, the, tubular, body, of, the, telescopic, sight, and, gives, an, indicative, readout, in, numerical, form, as, the, rifle, is, aimed, up, or, down, at, the, target, this, is, translated, into, a, figure, used, to, compute, the, horizontal, range, to, the, target, windage, plays, a, significant, role, with, the, effect, increasing, with, wind, speed, or, the, distance, of, the, shot, the, slant, of, visible, convections, near, the, ground, can, be, used, to, estimate, crosswinds, and, correct, the, point, of, aim, all, adjustments, for, range, wind, and, elevation, can, be, performed, by, aiming, off, the, target, called, holding, over, or, kentucky, windage, alternatively, the, scope, can, be, adjusted, so, that, the, point, of, aim, is, changed, to, compensate, for, these, factors, sometimes, referred, to, as, dialing, in, the, shooter, must, remember, to, return, the, scope, to, zeroed, position, adjusting, the, scope, allows, for, more, accurate, shots, because, the, cross, hairs, can, be, aligned, with, the, target, more, accurately, but, the, sniper, must, know, exactly, what, differences, the, changes, will, have, on, the, point, of, impact, at, each, target, range, for, moving, targets, the, point, of, aim, is, ahead, of, the, target, in, the, direction, of, movement, known, as, leading, the, target, the, amount, of, lead, depends, on, the, speed, and, angle, of, the, target, s, movement, as, well, as, the, distance, to, the, target, for, this, technique, holding, over, is, the, preferred, method, anticipating, the, behavior, of, the, target, is, necessary, to, accurately, place, the, shot, the, term, hide, site, refers, to, a, covered, and, concealed, position, from, which, a, sniper, and, his, team, can, conduct, surveillance, or, fire, at, targets, a, good, hide, conceals, and, camouflages, the, sniper, effectively, provides, cover, from, enemy, fire, and, allows, a, wide, view, of, the, surrounding, area, the, main, purpose, of, ghillie, suits, and, hide, sites, is, to, break, up, the, outline, of, a, person, with, a, rifle, many, snipers, use, ghillie, suits, to, hide, and, stay, hidden, ghillie, suits, vary, according, to, the, terrain, into, which, the, sniper, wishes, to, blend, for, example, in, dry, grassland, the, sniper, will, typically, wear, a, ghillie, suit, covered, in, dead, grass, shot, placement, which, is, where, on, the, body, the, sniper, is, aiming, varies, with, the, type, of, sniper, military, snipers, who, generally, do, not, shoot, at, targets, at, less, than, 300, m, 330, yd, usually, attempt, body, shots, aiming, at, the, chest, these, shots, depend, on, tissue, damage, organ, trauma, and, blood, loss, to, kill, the, target, body, shots, are, used, because, the, chest, is, a, larger, target, police, snipers, who, generally, shoot, at, much, shorter, distances, may, attempt, a, more, precise, shot, at, particular, parts, of, body, or, particular, devices, in, one, incident, in, 2007, in, marseille, a, gipn, sniper, took, a, shot, from, 80, m, 87, yd, at, the, pistol, of, a, police, officer, threatening, to, commit, suicide, destroying, the, weapon, and, preventing, the, police, officer, from, killing, himself, in, a, high, risk, or, hostage, taking, situation, where, a, suspect, is, imminently, threatening, to, kill, a, hostage, police, snipers, may, take, head, shots, to, ensure, an, instant, kill, the, snipers, aim, for, the, medulla, oblongata, to, sever, the, spine, from, the, brain, while, this, is, believed, to, prevent, the, target, from, reflexively, firing, their, weapon, there, is, evidence, that, any, brain, hit, is, sufficient, snipers, are, trained, for, the, detection, identification, and, location, of, a, targeted, soldier, in, sufficient, detail, to, permit, the, effective, employment, of, lethal, and, non, lethal, means, since, most, kills, in, modern, warfare, are, by, other, crew, served, weapons, reconnaissance, is, one, of, the, most, effective, uses, of, snipers, they, use, their, aerobic, conditioning, infiltration, skills, and, excellent, long, distance, observation, equipment, optical, scopes, and, tactics, to, approach, and, observe, the, enemy, in, this, role, their, rules, of, engagement, typically, let, them, shoot, at, high, value, targets, of, opportunity, such, as, enemy, officers, the, targets, may, be, personnel, or, high, value, materiel, military, equipment, and, weapons, but, most, often, they, target, the, most, important, enemy, personnel, such, as, officers, or, specialists, e, g, communications, operators, so, as, to, cause, maximum, disruption, to, enemy, operations, other, personnel, they, might, target, include, those, who, pose, an, immediate, threat, to, the, sniper, like, dog, handlers, who, are, often, employed, in, a, search, for, snipers, a, sniper, identifies, officers, by, their, appearance, and, behavior, such, as, symbols, of, rank, talking, to, radio, operators, sitting, as, a, passenger, in, a, car, sitting, in, a, car, with, a, large, radio, antenna, having, military, servants, binoculars, map, cases, or, talking, and, moving, position, more, frequently, if, possible, snipers, shoot, in, descending, order, by, rank, or, if, rank, is, unavailable, they, shoot, to, disrupt, communications, some, rifles, such, as, the, denel, ntw, 20, and, vidhwansak, are, designed, for, a, purely, anti, materiel, am, role, e, g, shooting, turbine, disks, of, parked, aircraft, missile, guidance, packages, expensive, optics, and, the, bearings, tubes, or, wave, guides, of, radar, sets, a, sniper, equipped, with, the, correct, rifle, can, target, radar, dishes, water, containers, the, engines, of, vehicles, and, any, number, of, other, targets, other, rifles, such, as, the, 50, caliber, rifles, produced, by, barrett, and, mcmillan, are, not, designed, exclusively, as, am, rifles, but, are, often, employed, in, such, a, way, providing, the, range, and, power, needed, for, am, applications, in, a, lightweight, package, compared, to, most, traditional, am, rifles, other, calibers, such, as, the, 408, cheyenne, tactical, and, the, 338, lapua, magnum, are, designed, to, be, capable, of, limited, am, application, but, are, ideally, suited, as, long, range, anti, personnel, rounds, often, in, situations, with, multiple, targets, snipers, use, relocation, after, firing, a, few, shots, from, a, certain, position, snipers, move, unseen, to, another, location, before, the, enemy, can, determine, where, they, are, and, mount, a, counter, attack, snipers, will, frequently, use, this, tactic, to, their, advantage, creating, an, atmosphere, of, chaos, and, confusion, in, other, rarer, situations, relocation, is, used, to, eliminate, the, factor, of, wind, as, sniper, rifles, are, often, extremely, powerful, and, consequently, loud, it, is, common, for, snipers, to, use, a, technique, known, as, sound, masking, when, employed, by, a, highly, skilled, marksman, this, tactic, can, be, used, as, a, substitute, for, a, noise, suppressor, very, loud, sounds, in, the, environment, such, as, artillery, shells, air, bursting, or, claps, of, thunder, can, often, mask, the, sound, of, the, shot, this, technique, is, frequently, used, in, clandestine, operations, infiltration, tactics, and, guerrilla, warfare, due, to, the, surprise, nature, of, sniper, fire, high, lethality, of, aimed, shots, and, frustration, at, the, inability, to, locate, and, counterattack, snipers, sniper, tactics, have, a, significant, negative, effect, on, morale, extensive, use, of, sniper, tactics, can, be, used, to, induce, constant, stress, and, fear, in, opposing, forces, making, them, afraid, to, move, about, or, leave, cover, in, many, ways, the, psychological, impact, imposed, by, snipers, is, quite, similar, to, those, of, landmines, booby, traps, and, ieds, constant, threat, high, per, event, lethality, inability, to, strike, back, historically, captured, snipers, are, often, summarily, executed, this, happened, during, world, war, i, and, world, war, ii, for, example, the, second, biscari, massacre, when, 36, suspected, snipers, were, lined, up, and, shot, on, 14, july, 1943, as, a, result, if, a, sniper, is, in, imminent, danger, of, capture, he, may, discard, any, items, sniper, rifle, laser, rangefinder, etc, which, might, indicate, his, status, as, a, sniper, the, risk, of, captured, snipers, being, summarily, executed, is, explicitly, referred, to, in, chapter, 6, of, us, army, doctrine, document, fm, 3, 060, 11, entitled, sniper, and, countersniper, tactics, techniques, and, procedures, historically, units, that, suffered, heavy, and, continual, casualties, from, urban, sniper, fire, and, were, frustrated, by, their, inability, to, strike, back, effectively, often, have, become, enraged, such, units, may, overreact, and, violate, the, laws, of, land, warfare, concerning, the, treatment, of, captured, snipers, this, tendency, is, magnified, if, the, unit, has, been, under, the, intense, stress, of, urban, combat, for, an, extended, time, it, is, vital, that, commanders, and, leaders, at, all, levels, understand, the, law, of, land, warfare, and, understand, the, psychological, pressures, of, urban, warfare, it, requires, strong, leadership, and, great, moral, strength, to, prevent, soldiers, from, releasing, their, anger, and, frustration, on, captured, snipers, or, civilians, suspected, of, sniping, at, them, the, negative, reputation, and, perception, of, snipers, can, be, traced, back, to, the, american, revolution, when, american, marksmen, intentionally, targeted, british, officers, an, act, considered, uncivilized, by, the, british, army, at, the, time, this, reputation, was, cemented, during, the, battle, of, saratoga, when, benedict, arnold, allegedly, ordered, his, marksmen, to, target, british, general, simon, fraser, an, act, that, won, the, battle, and, french, support, the, british, side, used, specially, selected, sharpshooters, as, well, often, german, mercenaries, to, demoralize, enemy, troops, snipers, can, follow, predictable, patterns, during, the, 26th, of, july, movement, in, the, cuban, revolution, the, revolutionaries, led, by, fidel, castro, always, killed, the, foremost, man, in, a, group, of, president, batista, s, soldiers, realizing, this, none, of, batista, s, men, would, walk, first, as, it, was, suicidal, this, effectively, decreased, the, army, s, willingness, to, search, for, rebel, bases, in, the, forests, and, mountains, an, alternative, approach, to, this, psychological, process, is, to, kill, the, second, man, in, the, row, leading, to, the, psychological, effect, of, nobody, wanting, to, follow, the, leader, the, occurrence, of, sniper, warfare, has, led, to, the, evolution, of, many, counter, sniper, tactics, in, modern, military, strategies, these, aim, to, reduce, the, damage, caused, by, a, sniper, to, an, army, which, can, often, be, harmful, to, both, combat, capabilities, and, morale, the, risk, of, damage, to, a, chain, of, command, can, be, reduced, by, removing, or, concealing, features, that, would, otherwise, indicate, an, officer, s, rank, modern, armies, tend, to, avoid, saluting, officers, in, the, field, and, eliminate, rank, insignia, on, battle, dress, uniforms, officers, can, seek, maximum, cover, before, revealing, themselves, as, good, candidates, for, elimination, through, actions, such, as, reading, maps, or, using, radios, friendly, snipers, can, be, used, to, hunt, the, enemy, sniper, besides, direct, observation, defending, forces, can, use, other, techniques, these, include, calculating, the, trajectory, of, a, bullet, by, triangulation, traditionally, triangulation, of, a, sniper, s, position, was, done, manually, though, radar, based, technology, has, recently, become, available, once, located, the, defenders, can, attempt, to, approach, the, sniper, from, cover, and, overwhelm, them, the, united, states, military, is, funding, a, project, known, as, redowl, robot, enhanced, detection, outpost, with, lasers, which, uses, laser, and, acoustic, sensors, to, determine, the, exact, direction, from, which, a, sniper, round, has, been, fired, the, more, rounds, fired, by, a, sniper, the, greater, the, chance, the, target, has, of, locating, him, thus, attempts, to, draw, fire, are, often, made, sometimes, by, offering, a, helmet, slightly, out, of, concealment, a, tactic, successfully, employed, in, the, winter, war, by, the, finns, known, as, kylm, kalle, cold, charlie, they, used, a, shop, mannequin, or, other, doll, dressed, as, a, tempting, target, such, as, an, officer, the, doll, was, then, presented, as, if, it, were, a, real, man, sloppily, covering, himself, usually, soviet, snipers, were, unable, to, resist, the, temptation, of, an, apparently, easy, kill, once, the, angle, where, the, bullet, came, from, was, determined, a, large, caliber, gun, such, as, a, lahti, l, 39, norsupyssy, elephant, rifle, anti, tank, rifle, was, fired, at, the, sniper, to, kill, him, other, tactics, include, directing, artillery, or, mortar, fire, onto, suspected, sniper, positions, the, use, of, smoke, screens, placing, tripwire, operated, munitions, mines, or, other, booby, traps, near, suspected, sniper, positions, even, dummy, trip, wires, can, be, placed, to, hamper, sniper, movement, if, anti, personnel, mines, are, unavailable, it, is, possible, to, improvise, booby, traps, by, connecting, trip, wires, to, hand, grenades, smoke, grenades, or, flares, though, these, may, not, kill, a, sniper, they, will, reveal, their, location, booby, trap, devices, can, be, placed, near, likely, sniper, hides, or, along, the, probable, routes, to, and, from, positions, knowledge, of, sniper, field, craft, will, assist, in, this, task, the, use, of, canine, units, had, been, very, successful, especially, during, the, vietnam, war, the, use, of, sniping, in, the, sense, of, shooting, at, relatively, long, range, from, a, concealed, position, to, murder, came, to, public, attention, in, a, number, of, sensational, u, s, criminal, cases, including, the, austin, sniper, incident, of, 1966, charles, whitman, the, john, f, kennedy, assassination, lee, harvey, oswald, and, the, beltway, sniper, attacks, of, late, 2002, lee, boyd, malvo, however, these, incidents, usually, do, not, involve, the, range, or, skill, of, military, snipers, in, all, three, cases, the, perpetrators, had, u, s, military, training, but, in, other, specialties, news, reports, will, often, inaccurately, use, the, term, sniper, to, describe, anyone, shooting, with, a, rifle, at, another, person, sniping, has, been, used, in, asymmetric, warfare, situations, for, example, in, the, northern, ireland, troubles, where, in, 1972, the, bloodiest, year, of, the, conflict, the, majority, of, the, soldiers, killed, were, shot, by, concealed, ira, riflemen, there, were, some, instances, in, the, early, 1990s, of, british, soldiers, and, ruc, personnel, being, shot, with, 50, caliber, barrett, rifles, by, sniper, teams, collectively, known, as, the, south, armagh, sniper, the, sniper, is, particularly, suited, to, combat, environments, where, one, side, is, at, a, disadvantage, a, careful, sniping, strategy, can, use, a, few, individuals, and, resources, to, thwart, the, movement, or, other, progress, of, a, much, better, equipped, or, larger, force, sniping, enables, a, few, persons, to, instil, terror, in, a, much, larger, regular, force, regardless, of, the, size, of, the, force, the, snipers, are, attached, to, it, is, widely, accepted, that, sniping, while, effective, in, specific, instances, is, much, more, effective, as, a, broadly, deployed, psychological, attack, or, as, a, force, multiplier, snipers, are, less, likely, to, be, treated, mercifully, than, non, snipers, if, captured, by, the, enemy, the, rationale, for, this, is, that, ordinary, soldiers, shoot, at, each, other, at, equal, opportunity, whilst, snipers, take, their, time, in, tracking, and, killing, individual, targets, in, a, methodical, fashion, with, a, relatively, low, risk, of, retaliation, in, 2003, the, u, s, led, multinational, coalition, composed, of, primarily, u, s, and, uk, troops, occupied, iraq, and, attempted, to, establish, a, new, government, in, the, country, however, shortly, after, the, initial, invasion, violence, against, coalition, forces, and, among, various, sectarian, groups, led, to, asymmetric, warfare, with, the, iraqi, insurgency, and, civil, war, between, many, sunni, and, shia, iraqis, through, to, november, 2005, the, army, had, attributed, 28, of, 2, 100, u, s, deaths, to, enemy, snipers, in, 2006, it, was, claimed, that, one, insurgent, sniper, juba, had, shot, up, to, 37, american, soldiers, training, materials, obtained, by, u, s, intelligence, had, among, its, tips, for, shooting, u, s, troops, killing, doctors, and, chaplains, is, suggested, as, a, means, of, psychological, warfare, suggesting, that, those, casualties, would, demoralize, entire, units, sniper, activity, was, reported, during, the, arab, spring, civil, unrest, in, libya, in, 2011, both, from, anti, governmental, and, pro, governmental, supporters, and, in, syria, at, least, from, pro, government, forces, even, before, firearms, were, available, soldiers, such, as, archers, were, specially, trained, as, elite, marksmen
