capitalism, is, an, economic, system, based, on, the, private, ownership, of, the, means, of, production, and, their, operation, for, profit, the, defining, characteristics, of, capitalism, include, capital, accumulation, competitive, markets, price, systems, private, property, recognition, of, property, rights, self, interest, economic, freedom, meritocracy, work, ethic, consumer, sovereignty, economic, efficiency, limited, role, of, government, profit, motive, a, financial, infrastructure, of, money, and, investment, that, makes, possible, credit, and, debt, entrepreneurship, commodification, voluntary, exchange, wage, labor, production, of, commodities, and, services, and, a, strong, emphasis, on, innovation, and, economic, growth, in, a, market, economy, decision, making, and, investments, are, determined, by, owners, of, wealth, property, or, ability, to, maneuver, capital, or, production, ability, in, capital, and, financial, markets, whereas, prices, and, the, distribution, of, goods, and, services, are, mainly, determined, by, competition, in, goods, and, services, markets, economists, historians, political, economists, and, sociologists, have, adopted, different, perspectives, in, their, analyses, of, capitalism, and, have, recognized, various, forms, of, it, in, practice, these, include, laissez, faire, or, free, market, capitalism, anarcho, capitalism, state, capitalism, and, welfare, capitalism, different, forms, of, capitalism, feature, varying, degrees, of, free, markets, public, ownership, obstacles, to, free, competition, and, state, sanctioned, social, policies, the, degree, of, competition, in, markets, and, the, role, of, intervention, and, regulation, as, well, as, the, scope, of, state, ownership, vary, across, different, models, of, capitalism, the, extent, to, which, different, markets, are, free, and, the, rules, defining, private, property, are, matters, of, politics, and, policy, most, of, the, existing, capitalist, economies, are, mixed, economies, that, combine, elements, of, free, markets, with, state, intervention, and, in, some, cases, economic, planning, capitalism, in, its, modern, form, emerged, from, agrarianism, in, england, as, well, as, mercantilist, practices, by, european, countries, between, the, 16th, and, 18th, centuries, the, industrial, revolution, of, the, 18th, century, established, capitalism, as, a, dominant, mode, of, production, characterized, by, factory, work, and, a, complex, division, of, labor, through, the, process, of, globalization, capitalism, spread, across, the, world, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, especially, before, world, war, i, and, after, the, end, of, the, cold, war, during, the, 19th, century, capitalism, was, largely, unregulated, by, the, state, but, became, more, regulated, in, the, post, world, war, ii, period, through, keynesianism, followed, by, a, return, of, more, unregulated, capitalism, starting, in, the, 1980s, through, neoliberalism, the, existence, of, market, economies, has, been, observed, under, many, forms, of, government, and, across, a, vast, array, of, historical, periods, geographical, locations, and, cultural, contexts, the, modern, industrial, capitalist, societies, that, exist, today, developed, in, western, europe, as, a, result, of, the, industrial, revolution, the, accumulation, of, capital, is, the, primary, mechanism, through, which, capitalist, economies, promote, economic, growth, however, it, is, a, characteristic, of, such, economies, that, they, experience, a, business, cycle, of, economic, growth, followed, by, recessions, the, term, capitalist, meaning, an, owner, of, capital, appears, earlier, than, the, term, capitalism, and, dates, to, the, mid, 17th, century, capitalism, is, derived, from, capital, which, evolved, from, capitale, a, late, latin, word, based, on, caput, meaning, head, which, is, also, the, origin, of, chattel, and, cattle, in, the, sense, of, movable, property, only, much, later, to, refer, only, to, livestock, capitale, emerged, in, the, 12th, to, 13th, centuries, to, refer, to, funds, stock, of, merchandise, sum, of, money, or, money, carrying, interest, 232, by, 1283, it, was, used, in, the, sense, of, the, capital, assets, of, a, trading, firm, and, was, often, interchanged, with, other, words, wealth, money, funds, goods, assets, property, and, so, on, 233, the, hollantse, german, holl, ndische, mercurius, uses, capitalists, in, 1633, and, 1654, to, refer, to, owners, of, capital, 234, in, french, tienne, clavier, referred, to, capitalistes, in, 1788, four, years, before, its, first, recorded, english, usage, by, arthur, young, in, his, work, travels, in, france, 1792, in, his, principles, of, political, economy, and, taxation, 1817, david, ricardo, referred, to, the, capitalist, many, times, english, poet, samuel, taylor, coleridge, used, capitalist, in, his, work, table, talk, 1823, pierre, joseph, proudhon, used, the, term, in, his, first, work, what, is, property, 1840, to, refer, to, the, owners, of, capital, benjamin, disraeli, used, the, term, in, his, 1845, work, sybil, alexander, hamilton, used, capitalist, in, his, report, of, manufactures, presented, to, the, united, states, congress, in, 1791, the, initial, use, of, the, term, capitalism, in, its, modern, sense, is, attributed, to, louis, blanc, in, 1850, what, i, call, capitalism, that, is, to, say, the, appropriation, of, capital, by, some, to, the, exclusion, of, others, and, pierre, joseph, proudhon, in, 1861, economic, and, social, regime, in, which, capital, the, source, of, income, does, not, generally, belong, to, those, who, make, it, work, through, their, labor, 237, karl, marx, frequently, referred, to, the, capital, and, to, the, capitalist, mode, of, production, in, das, kapital, 1867, marx, did, not, use, the, form, capitalism, but, instead, used, capital, capitalist, and, capitalist, mode, of, production, which, appear, frequently, due, to, the, word, being, coined, by, socialist, critics, of, capitalism, economist, and, historian, robert, hessen, stated, that, the, term, capitalism, itself, is, a, term, of, disparagement, and, a, misnomer, for, economic, individualism, bernard, harcourt, agrees, with, the, statement, that, the, term, is, a, misnomer, adding, that, it, misleadingly, suggests, that, there, is, such, a, thing, as, capital, that, inherently, functions, in, certain, ways, and, is, governed, by, stable, economic, laws, of, its, own, in, the, english, language, the, term, capitalism, first, appears, according, to, the, oxford, english, dictionary, oed, in, 1854, in, the, novel, the, newcomes, by, novelist, william, makepeace, thackeray, where, the, word, meant, having, ownership, of, capital, also, according, to, the, oed, carl, adolph, douai, a, german, american, socialist, and, abolitionist, used, the, term, private, capitalism, in, 1863, there, is, no, universally, agreed, upon, definition, of, capitalism, it, is, unclear, whether, or, not, capitalism, characterizes, an, entire, society, a, specific, type, of, social, order, or, crucial, components, or, elements, of, a, society, societies, officially, founded, in, opposition, to, capitalism, such, as, the, soviet, union, have, sometimes, been, argued, to, actually, exhibit, characteristics, of, capitalism, nancy, fraser, describes, usage, of, the, term, capitalism, by, many, authors, as, mainly, rhetorical, functioning, less, as, an, actual, concept, than, as, a, gesture, toward, the, need, for, a, concept, scholars, who, are, uncritical, of, capitalism, rarely, actually, use, the, term, capitalism, some, doubt, that, the, term, capitalism, possesses, valid, scientific, dignity, and, it, is, generally, not, discussed, in, mainstream, economics, with, economist, daron, acemoglu, suggesting, that, the, term, capitalism, should, be, abandoned, entirely, consequently, understanding, of, the, concept, of, capitalism, tends, to, be, heavily, influenced, by, opponents, of, capitalism, and, by, the, followers, and, critics, of, karl, marx, capitalism, in, its, modern, form, can, be, traced, to, the, emergence, of, agrarian, capitalism, and, mercantilism, in, the, early, renaissance, in, city, states, like, florence, capital, has, existed, incipiently, on, a, small, scale, for, centuries, in, the, form, of, merchant, renting, and, lending, activities, and, occasionally, as, small, scale, industry, with, some, wage, labor, simple, commodity, exchange, and, consequently, simple, commodity, production, which, is, the, initial, basis, for, the, growth, of, capital, from, trade, have, a, very, long, history, during, the, islamic, golden, age, arabs, promulgated, capitalist, economic, policies, such, as, free, trade, and, banking, their, use, of, indo, arabic, numerals, facilitated, bookkeeping, these, innovations, migrated, to, europe, through, trade, partners, in, cities, such, as, venice, and, pisa, italian, mathematicians, traveled, the, mediterranean, talking, to, arab, traders, and, returned, to, popularize, the, use, of, indo, arabic, numerals, in, europe, the, economic, foundations, of, the, feudal, agricultural, system, began, to, shift, substantially, in, 16th, century, england, as, the, manorial, system, had, broken, down, and, land, began, to, become, concentrated, in, the, hands, of, fewer, landlords, with, increasingly, large, estates, instead, of, a, serf, based, system, of, labor, workers, were, increasingly, employed, as, part, of, a, broader, and, expanding, money, based, economy, the, system, put, pressure, on, both, landlords, and, tenants, to, increase, the, productivity, of, agriculture, to, make, profit, the, weakened, coercive, power, of, the, aristocracy, to, extract, peasant, surpluses, encouraged, them, to, try, better, methods, and, the, tenants, also, had, incentive, to, improve, their, methods, in, order, to, flourish, in, a, competitive, labor, market, terms, of, rent, for, land, were, becoming, subject, to, economic, market, forces, rather, than, to, the, previous, stagnant, system, of, custom, and, feudal, obligation, the, economic, doctrine, prevailing, from, the, 16th, to, the, 18th, centuries, is, commonly, called, mercantilism, this, period, the, age, of, discovery, was, associated, with, the, geographic, exploration, of, foreign, lands, by, merchant, traders, especially, from, england, and, the, low, countries, mercantilism, was, a, system, of, trade, for, profit, although, commodities, were, still, largely, produced, by, non, capitalist, methods, most, scholars, consider, the, era, of, merchant, capitalism, and, mercantilism, as, the, origin, of, modern, capitalism, although, karl, polanyi, argued, that, the, hallmark, of, capitalism, is, the, establishment, of, generalized, markets, for, what, he, called, the, fictitious, commodities, i, e, land, labor, and, money, accordingly, he, argued, that, not, until, 1834, was, a, competitive, labor, market, established, in, england, hence, industrial, capitalism, as, a, social, system, cannot, be, said, to, have, existed, before, that, date, england, began, a, large, scale, and, integrative, approach, to, mercantilism, during, the, elizabethan, era, 1558, 1603, a, systematic, and, coherent, explanation, of, balance, of, trade, was, made, public, through, thomas, mun, s, argument, england, s, treasure, by, forraign, trade, or, the, balance, of, our, forraign, trade, is, the, rule, of, our, treasure, it, was, written, in, the, 1620s, and, published, in, 1664, european, merchants, backed, by, state, controls, subsidies, and, monopolies, made, most, of, their, profits, by, buying, and, selling, goods, in, the, words, of, francis, bacon, the, purpose, of, mercantilism, was, the, opening, and, well, balancing, of, trade, the, cherishing, of, manufacturers, the, banishing, of, idleness, the, repressing, of, waste, and, excess, by, sumptuary, laws, the, improvement, and, husbanding, of, the, soil, the, regulation, of, prices, after, the, period, of, the, proto, industrialization, the, british, east, india, company, and, the, dutch, east, india, company, after, massive, contributions, from, the, mughal, bengal, inaugurated, an, expansive, era, of, commerce, and, trade, these, companies, were, characterized, by, their, colonial, and, expansionary, powers, given, to, them, by, nation, states, during, this, era, merchants, who, had, traded, under, the, previous, stage, of, mercantilism, invested, capital, in, the, east, india, companies, and, other, colonies, seeking, a, return, on, investment, in, the, mid, 18th, century, a, group, of, economic, theorists, led, by, david, hume, 1711, 1776, and, adam, smith, 1723, 1790, challenged, fundamental, mercantilist, doctrines, such, as, the, belief, that, the, world, s, wealth, remained, constant, and, that, a, state, could, only, increase, its, wealth, at, the, expense, of, another, state, during, the, industrial, revolution, industrialists, replaced, merchants, as, a, dominant, factor, in, the, capitalist, system, and, effected, the, decline, of, the, traditional, handicraft, skills, of, artisans, guilds, and, journeymen, industrial, capitalism, marked, the, development, of, the, factory, system, of, manufacturing, characterized, by, a, complex, division, of, labor, between, and, within, work, process, and, the, routine, of, work, tasks, and, eventually, established, the, domination, of, the, capitalist, mode, of, production, industrial, britain, eventually, abandoned, the, protectionist, policy, formerly, prescribed, by, mercantilism, in, the, 19th, century, richard, cobden, 1804, 1865, and, john, bright, 1811, 1889, who, based, their, beliefs, on, the, manchester, school, initiated, a, movement, to, lower, tariffs, in, the, 1840s, britain, adopted, a, less, protectionist, policy, with, the, 1846, repeal, of, the, corn, laws, and, the, 1849, repeal, of, the, navigation, acts, britain, reduced, tariffs, and, quotas, in, line, with, david, ricardo, s, advocacy, of, free, trade, broader, processes, of, globalization, carried, capitalism, across, the, world, by, the, beginning, of, the, nineteenth, century, a, series, of, loosely, connected, market, systems, had, come, together, as, a, relatively, integrated, global, system, in, turn, intensifying, processes, of, economic, and, other, globalization, late, in, the, 20th, century, capitalism, overcame, a, challenge, by, centrally, planned, economies, and, is, now, the, encompassing, system, worldwide, with, the, mixed, economy, as, its, dominant, form, in, the, industrialized, western, world, industrialization, allowed, cheap, production, of, household, items, using, economies, of, scale, while, rapid, population, growth, created, sustained, demand, for,

mainly, tied, to, the, gold, standard, the, united, kingdom, first, formally, adopted, this, standard, in, 1821, soon, to, follow, were, canada, in, 1853, newfoundland, in, 1865, the, united, states,

societal, skepticism, and, criticism, of, capitalism, and, its, most, ardent, supporters, contemporary, capitalist, societies, developed, in, the, west, from, 1950, to, the, present, and, this, type,

research, on, the, state, of, capitalism, in, 1867, the, postwar, boom, ended, in, the, late, 1960s, and, early, 1970s, and, the, economic, situation, grew, worse, with, the, rise, of, stagflation, monetarism, a, modification, of, keynesianism, that, is, more, compatible, with, laissez, faire, analyses, gained, increasing, prominence, in, the, capitalist, world, especially, under, the, years, in, office, of, ronald, reagan, in, the, united, states, 1981, 1989, and, of, margaret, thatcher, in, the, united, kingdom, 1979, 1990, public, and, political, interest, began, shifting, away, from,

economy, would, have, been, impossible, without, the, fall, of, communism, harvard, kennedy, school, economist, dani, rodrik, distinguishes, between, three, historical, variants, of, capitalism, the, relationship, between, democracy, and, capitalism, is, a, contentious, area, in, theory, and, in, popular, political, movements, the, extension, of, adult, male, suffrage, in, 19th, century, britain, occurred, along, with, the, development, of, industrial, capitalism, and, representative, democracy, became, widespread, at, the, same, time, as, capitalism, leading, capitalists, to, posit, a, causal, or, mutual, relationship, between, them, however, according, to, some, authors, in, the, 20th, century, capitalism, also, accompanied, a, variety, of, political, formations, quite, distinct, from, liberal, democracies, including, fascist, regimes, absolute, monarchies, and, single, party, states, democratic, peace, theory, asserts, that, democracies, seldom, fight, other, democracies, but, others, suggest, this, may, be, because, of, political, similarity, or, stability, rather, than, because, they, are, democratic, or, capitalist, critics, argue, that, though, economic, growth, under, capitalism, has, led, to, democracy, it, may, not, do, so, in, the, future, as, authoritarian, r, gimes, have, been, able, to, manage, economic, growth, using, some, of, capitalism, s, competitive, principles, without, making, concessions, to, greater, political, freedom, political, scientists, torben, iversen, and, david, soskice, see, democracy, and, capitalism, as, mutually, supportive, robert, dahl, argued, in, on, democracy, that, capitalism, was, beneficial, for, democracy, because, economic, growth, and, a, large, middle, class, were, good, for, democracy, he, also, argued, that, a, market, economy, provided, a, substitute, for, government, control, of, the, economy, which, reduces, the, risks, of, tyranny, and, authoritarianism, in, his, book, the, road, to, serfdom, 1944, friedrich, hayek, 1899, 1992, asserted, that, the, free, market, understanding, of, economic, freedom, as, present, in, capitalism, is, a, requisite, of, political, freedom, he, argued, that, the, market, mechanism, is, the, only, way, of, deciding, what, to, produce, and, how, to, distribute, the, items, without, using, coercion, milton, friedman, and, ronald, reagan, also, promoted, this, view, friedman, claimed, that, centralized, economic, operations, are, always, accompanied, by, political, repression, in, his, view, transactions, in, a, market, economy, are, voluntary, and, the, wide, diversity, that, voluntary, activity, permits, is, a, fundamental, threat, to, repressive, political, leaders, and, greatly, diminishes, their, power, to, coerce, some, of, friedman, s, views, were, shared, by, john, maynard, keynes, who, believed, that, capitalism, was, vital, for, freedom, to, survive, and, thrive, freedom, house, an, american, think, tank, that, conducts, international, research, on, and, advocates, for, democracy, political, freedom, and, human, rights, has, argued, that, there, is, a, high, and, statistically, significant, correlation, between, the, level, of, political, freedom, as, measured, by, freedom, house, and, economic, freedom, as, measured, by, the, wall, street, journal, heritage, foundation, survey, in, capital, in, the, twenty, first, century, 2013, thomas, piketty, of, the, paris, school, of, economics, asserted, that, inequality, is, the, inevitable, consequence, of, economic, growth, in, a, capitalist, economy, and, the, resulting, concentration, of, wealth, can, destabilize, democratic, societies, and, undermine, the, ideals, of, social, justice, upon, which, they, are, built, states, with, capitalistic, economic, systems, have, thrived, under, political, regimes, deemed, to, be, authoritarian, or, oppressive, singapore, has, a, successful, open, market, economy, as, a, result, of, its, competitive, business, friendly, climate, and, robust, rule, of, law, nonetheless, it, often, comes, under, fire, for, its, style, of, government, which, though, democratic, and, consistently, one, of, the, least, corrupt, operates, largely, under, a, one, party, rule, furthermore, it, does, not, vigorously, defend, freedom, of, expression, as, evidenced, by, its, government, regulated, press, and, its, penchant, for, upholding, laws, protecting, ethnic, and, religious, harmony, judicial, dignity, and, personal, reputation, the, private, capitalist, sector, in, the, people, s, republic, of, china, has, grown, exponentially, and, thrived, since, its, inception, despite, having, an, authoritarian, government, augusto, pinochet, s, rule, in, chile, led, to, economic, growth, and, high, levels, of, inequality, by, using, authoritarian, means, to, create, a, safe, environment, for, investment, and, capitalism, similarly, suharto, s, authoritarian, reign, and, extirpation, of, the, communist, party, of, indonesia, allowed, for, the, expansion, of, capitalism, in, indonesia, the, term, capitalism, in, its, modern, sense, is, often, attributed, to, karl, marx, in, his, das, kapital, marx, analyzed, the, capitalist, mode, of, production, using, a, method, of, understanding, today, known, as, marxism, however, marx, himself, rarely, used, the, term, capitalism, while, it, was, used, twice, in, the, more, political, interpretations, of, his, work, primarily, authored, by, his, collaborator, friedrich, engels, in, the, 20th, century, defenders, of, the, capitalist, system, often, replaced, the, term, capitalism, with, phrases, such, as, free, enterprise, and, private, enterprise, and, replaced, capitalist, with, rentier, and, investor, in, reaction, to, the, negative, connotations, associated, with, capitalism, in, general, capitalism, as, an, economic, system, and, mode, of, production, can, be, summarized, by, the, following, in, free, market, and, laissez, faire, forms, of, capitalism, markets, are, used, most, extensively, with, minimal, or, no, regulation, over, the, pricing, mechanism, in, mixed, economies, which, are, almost, universal, today, markets, continue, to, play, a, dominant, role, but, they, are, regulated, to, some, extent, by, the, state, in, order, to, correct, market, failures, promote, social, welfare, conserve, natural, resources, fund, defense, and, public, safety, or, other, rationale, in, state, capitalist, systems, markets, are, relied, upon, the, least, with, the, state, relying, heavily, on, state, owned, enterprises, or, indirect, economic, planning, to, accumulate, capital, competition, arises, when, more, than, one, producer, is, trying, to, sell, the, same, or, similar, products, to, the, same, buyers, adherents, of, the, capitalist, theory, believe, that, competition, leads, to, innovation, and, more, affordable, prices, monopolies, or, cartels, can, develop, especially, if, there, is, no, competition, a, monopoly, occurs, when, a, firm, has, exclusivity, over, a, market, hence, the, firm, can, engage, in, rent, seeking, behaviors, such, as, limiting, output, and, raising, prices, because, it, has, no, fear, of, competition, governments, have, implemented, legislation, for, the, purpose, of, preventing, the, creation, of, monopolies, and, cartels, in, 1890, the, sherman, antitrust, act, became, the, first, legislation, passed, by, the, united, states, congress, to, limit, monopolies, wage, labor, usually, referred, to, as, paid, work, paid, employment, or, paid, labor, refers, to, the, socioeconomic, relationship, between, a, worker, and, an, employer, in, which, the, worker, sells, their, labor, power, under, a, formal, or, informal, employment, contract, these, transactions, usually, occur, in, a, labor, market, where, wages, or, salaries, are, market, determined, in, exchange, for, the, money, paid, as, wages, usual, for, short, term, work, contracts, or, salaries, in, permanent, employment, contracts, the, work, product, generally, becomes, the, undifferentiated, property, of, the, employer, a, wage, laborer, is, a, person, whose, primary, means, of, income, is, from, the, selling, of, their, labor, in, this, way, the, profit, motive, in, the, theory, of, capitalism, is, the, desire, to, earn, income, in, the, form, of, profit, stated, differently, the, reason, for, a, business, s, existence, is, to, turn, a, profit, the, profit, motive, functions, according, to, rational, choice, theory, or, the, theory, that, individuals, tend, to, pursue, what, is, in, their, own, best, interests, accordingly, businesses, seek, to, benefit, themselves, and, or, their, shareholders, by, maximizing, profit, in, capitalist, theoretics, the, profit, motive, is, said, to, ensure, that, resources, are, being, allocated, efficiently, for, instance, austrian, economist, henry, hazlitt, explains, if, there, is, no, profit, in, making, an, article, it, is, a, sign, that, the, labor, and, capital, devoted, to, its, production, are, misdirected, the, value, of, the, resources, that, must, be, used, up, in, making, the, article, is, greater, than, the, value, of, the, article, itself, socialist, theorists, note, that, unlike, mercantilists, capitalists, accumulate, their, profits, while, expecting, their, profit, rates, to, remain, the, same, this, causes, problems, as, earnings, in, the, rest, of, society, do, not, increase, in, the, same, proportion, the, relationship, between, the, state, its, formal, mechanisms, and, capitalist, societies, has, been, debated, in, many, fields, of, social, and, political, theory, with, active, discussion, since, the, 19th, century, hernando, de, soto, is, a, contemporary, peruvian, economist, who, has, argued, that, an, important, characteristic, of, capitalism, is, the, functioning, state, protection, of, property, rights, in, a, formal, property, system, where, ownership, and, transactions, are, clearly, recorded, according, to, de, soto, this, is, the, process, by, which, physical, assets, are, transformed, into, capital, which, in, turn, may, be, used, in, many, more, ways, and, much, more, efficiently, in, the, market, economy, a, number, of, marxian, economists, have, argued, that, the, inclosure, acts, in, england, and, similar, legislation, elsewhere, were, an, integral, part, of, capitalist, primitive, accumulation, and, that, specific, legal, frameworks, of, private, land, ownership, have, been, integral, to, the, development, of, capitalism, private, property, rights, are, not, absolute, as, in, many, countries, the, state, has, the, power, to, seize, private, property, typically, for, public, use, under, the, powers, of, eminent, domain, in, capitalist, economics, market, competition, is, the, rivalry, among, sellers, trying, to, achieve, such, goals, as, increasing, profits, market, share, and, sales, volume, by, varying, the, elements, of, the, marketing, mix, price, product, distribution, and, promotion, merriam, webster, defines, competition, in, business, as, the, effort, of, two, or, more, parties, acting, independently, to, secure, the, business, of, a, third, party, by, offering, the, most, favourable, terms, it, was, described, by, adam, smith, in, the, wealth, of, nations, 1776, and, later, economists, as, allocating, productive, resources, to, their, most, highly, valued, uses, and, encouraging, efficiency, smith, and, other, classical, economists, before, antoine, augustine, cournot, were, referring, to, price, and, non, price, rivalry, among, producers, to, sell, their, goods, on, best, terms, by, bidding, of, buyers, not, necessarily, to, a, large, number, of, sellers, nor, to, a, market, in, final, equilibrium, competition, is, widespread, throughout, the, market, process, it, is, a, condition, where, buyers, tend, to, compete, with, other, buyers, and, sellers, tend, to, compete, with, other, sellers, in, offering, goods, for, exchange, buyers, competitively, bid, to, purchase, specific, quantities, of, specific, goods, which, are, available, or, might, be, available, if, sellers, were, to, choose, to, offer, such, goods, similarly, sellers, bid, against, other, sellers, in, offering, goods, on, the, market, competing, for, the, attention, and, exchange, resources, of, buyers, competition, results, from, scarcity, as, it, is, not, possible, to, satisfy, all, conceivable, human, wants, and, occurs, as, people, try, to, meet, the, criteria, being, used, to, determine, allocation, 105, in, the, works, of, adam, smith, the, idea, of, capitalism, is, made, possible, through, competition, which, creates, growth, although, capitalism, had, not, entered, mainstream, economics, at, the, time, of, smith, it, is, vital, to, the, construction, of, his, ideal, society, one, of, the, foundational, blocks, of, capitalism, is, competition, smith, believed, that, a, prosperous, society, is, one, where, everyone, should, be, free, to, enter, and, leave, the, market, and, change, trades, as, often, as, he, pleases, he, believed, that, the, freedom, to, act, in, one, s, self, interest, is, essential, for, the, success, of, a, capitalist, society, in, response, to, the, idea, that, if, all, participants, focus, on, their, own, goals, society, s, well, being, will, be, water, under, the, bridge, smith, maintains, that, despite, the, concerns, of, intellectuals, global, trends, will, hardly, be, altered, if, they, refrain, from, pursuing, their, personal, ends, he, insisted, that, the, actions, of, a, few, participants, cannot, alter, the, course, of, society, instead, smith, maintained, that, they, should, focus, on, personal, progress, instead, and, that, this, will, result, in, overall, growth, to, the, whole, competition, between, participants, who, are, all, endeavoring, to, justle, one, another, out, of, employment, obliges, every, man, to, endeavor, to, execute, his, work, through, competition, towards, growth, economic, growth, is, a, characteristic, tendency, of, capitalist, economies, however, capitalist, economies, may, experience, fluctuations, in, growth, that, cannot, be, accounted, for, by, demographic, or, technological, changes, these, fluctuations, which, involve, sustained, periods, of, economic, growth, and, recession, are, referred, to, as, business, cycles, in, macroeconomics, economic, growth, is, measured, as, growth, in, investment, economic, output, and, economic, consumption, per, capita, changes, in, hours, of, employment, on, their, own, are, not, considered, as, a, factor, of, economic, growth, the, capitalist, mode, of, production, refers, to, the, systems, of, organising, production, and, distribution, within, capitalist, societies, private, money, making, in, various, forms, renting, banking, merchant, trade, production, for, profit, and, so, on, preceded, the, development, of, the, capitalist, mode, of, production, as, such, the, term, capitalist, mode, of, production, is, defined, by, private, ownership, of, the, means, of, production, extraction, of, surplus, value, by, the, owning, class, for, the, purpose, of, capital, accumulation, wage, based, labor, and, at, least, as, far, as, commodities, are, concerned, being, market, based, capitalism, in, the, form, of, money, making, activity, has, existed, in, the, shape, of, merchants, and, money, lenders, who, acted, as, intermediaries, between, consumers, and, producers, engaging, in, simple, commodity, production, hence, the, reference, to, merchant, capitalism, since, the, beginnings, of, civilisation, what, is, specific, about, the, capitalist, mode, of, production, is, that, most, of, the, inputs, and, outputs, of, production, are, supplied, through, the, market, i, e, they, are, commodities, and, essentially, all, production, is, in, this, mode, by, contrast, in, flourishing, feudalism, most, or, all, of, the, factors, of, production, including, labor, are, owned, by, the, feudal, ruling, class, outright, and, the, products, may, also, be, consumed, without, a, market, of, any, kind, it, is, production, for, use, within, the, feudal, social, unit, and, for, limited, trade, this, has, the, important, consequence, that, under, capitalism, the, whole, organisation, of, the, production, process, is, reshaped, and, re, organised, to, conform, with, economic, rationality, as, bounded, by, capitalism, which, is, expressed, in, price, relationships, between, inputs, and, outputs, wages, non, labor, factor, costs, sales, and, profits, rather, than, the, larger, rational, context, faced, by, society, overall, that, is, the, whole, process, is, organised, and, re, shaped, in, order, to, conform, to, commercial, logic, essentially, capital, accumulation, comes, to, define, economic, rationality, in, capitalist, production, a, society, region, or, nation, is, capitalist, if, the, predominant, source, of, incomes, and, products, being, distributed, is, capitalist, activity, but, even, so, this, does, not, yet, mean, necessarily, that, the, capitalist, mode, of, production, is, dominant, in, that, society, mixed, economies, rely, on, the, nation, they, are, in, to, provide, some, goods, or, services, while, the, free, market, produces, and, maintains, the, rest, government, agencies, regulate, the, standards, of, service, in, many, industries, such, as, airlines, and, broadcasting, as, well, as, financing, a, wide, range, of, programs, in, addition, the, government, regulates, the, flow, of, capital, and, uses, financial, tools, such, as, the, interest, rate, to, control, such, factors, as, inflation, and, unemployment, in, capitalist, economic, structures, supply, and, demand, is, an, economic, model, of, price, determination, in, a, market, it, postulates, that, in, a, perfectly, competitive, market, the, unit, price, for, a, particular, good, will, vary, until, it, settles, at, a, point, where, the, quantity, demanded, by, consumers, at, the, current, price, will, equal, the, quantity, supplied, by, producers, at, the, current, price, resulting, in, an, economic, equilibrium, for, price, and, quantity, the, basic, laws, of, supply, and, demand, as, described, by, david, besanko, and, ronald, braeutigam, are, the, following, four, 37, a, supply, schedule, is, a, table, that, shows, the, relationship, between, the, price, of, a, good, and, the, quantity, supplied, a, demand, schedule, depicted, graphically, as, the, demand, curve, represents, the, amount, of, some, goods, that, buyers, are, willing, and, able, to, purchase, at, various, prices, assuming, all, determinants, of, demand, other, than, the, price, of, the, good, in, question, such, as, income, tastes, and, preferences, the, price, of, substitute, goods, and, the, price, of, complementary, goods, remain, the, same, according, to, the, law, of, demand, the, demand, curve, is, almost, always, represented, as, downward, sloping, meaning, that, as, price, decreases, consumers, will, buy, more, of, the, good, just, like, the, supply, curves, reflect, marginal, cost, curves, demand, curves, are, determined, by, marginal, utility, curves, in, the, context, of, supply, and, demand, economic, equilibrium, refers, to, a, state, where, economic, forces, such, as, supply, and, demand, are, balanced, and, in, the, absence, of, external, influences, the, equilibrium, values, of, economic, variables, will, not, change, for, example, in, the, standard, text, book, model, of, perfect, competition, equilibrium, occurs, at, the, point, at, which, quantity, demanded, and, quantity, supplied, are, equal, market, equilibrium, in, this, case, refers, to, a, condition, where, a, market, price, is, established, through, competition, such, that, the, amount, of, goods, or, services, sought, by, buyers, is, equal, to, the, amount, of, goods, or, services, produced, by, sellers, this, price, is, often, called, the, competitive, price, or, market, clearing, price, and, will, tend, not, to, change, unless, demand, or, supply, changes, partial, equilibrium, as, the, name, suggests, takes, into, consideration, only, a, part, of, the, market, to, attain, equilibrium, jain, proposes, attributed, to, george, stigler, a, partial, equilibrium, is, one, which, is, based, on, only, a, restricted, range, of, data, a, standard, example, is, price, of, a, single, product, the, prices, of, all, other, products, being, held, fixed, during, the, analysis, according, to, hamid, s, hosseini, the, power, of, supply, and, demand, was, discussed, to, some, extent, by, several, early, muslim, scholars, such, as, fourteenth, century, mamluk, scholar, ibn, taymiyyah, who, wrote, if, desire, for, goods, increases, while, its, availability, decreases, its, price, rises, on, the, other, hand, if, availability, of, the, good, increases, and, the, desire, for, it, decreases, the, price, comes, down, john, locke, s, 1691, work, some, considerations, on, the, consequences, of, the, lowering, of, interest, and, the, raising, of, the, value, of, money, includes, an, early, and, clear, description, of, supply, and, demand, and, their, relationship, in, this, description, demand, is, rent, the, price, of, any, commodity, rises, or, falls, by, the, proportion, of, the, number, of, buyer, and, sellers, and, that, which, regulates, the, price, is, nothing, else, but, their, quantity, in, proportion, to, their, rent, david, ricardo, titled, one, chapter, of, his, 1817, work, principles, of, political, economy, and, taxation, on, the, influence, of, demand, and, supply, on, price, in, principles, of, political, economy, and, taxation, ricardo, more, rigorously, laid, down, the, idea, of, the, assumptions, that, were, used, to, build, his, ideas, of, supply, and, demand, in, his, 1870, essay, on, the, graphical, representation, of, supply, and, demand, fleeming, jenkin, in, the, course, of, introduc, the, diagrammatic, method, into, the, english, economic, literature, published, the, first, drawing, of, supply, and, demand, curves, therein, including, comparative, statics, from, a, shift, of, supply, or, demand, and, application, to, the, labor, market, the, model, was, further, developed, and, popularized, by, alfred, marshall, in, the, 1890, textbook, principles, of, economics, there, are, many, variants, of, capitalism, in, existence, that, differ, according, to, country, and, region, they, vary, in, their, institutional, makeup, and, by, their, economic, policies, the, common, features, among, all, the, different, forms, of, capitalism, are, that, they, are, predominantly, based, on, the, private, ownership, of, the, means, of, production, and, the, production, of, goods, and, services, for, profit, the, market, based, allocation, of, resources, and, the, accumulation, of, capital, they, include, advanced, capitalism, corporate, capitalism, finance, capitalism, free, market, capitalism, mercantilism, social, capitalism, state, capitalism, and, welfare, capitalism, other, theoretical, variants, of, capitalism, include, anarcho, capitalism, community, capitalism, humanistic, capitalism, neo, capitalism, state, monopoly, capitalism, and, technocapitalism, advanced, capitalism, is, the, situation, that, pertains, to, a, society, in, which, the, capitalist, model, has, been, integrated, and, developed, deeply, and, extensively, for, a, prolonged, period, various, writers, identify, antonio, gramsci, as, an, influential, early, theorist, of, advanced, capitalism, even, if, he, did, not, use, the, term, himself, in, his, writings, gramsci, sought, to, explain, how, capitalism, had, adapted, to, avoid, the, revolutionary, overthrow, that, had, seemed, inevitable, in, the, 19th, century, at, the, heart, of, his, explanation, was, the, decline, of, raw, coercion, as, a, tool, of, class, power, replaced, by, use, of, civil, society, institutions, to, manipulate, public, ideology, in, the, capitalists, favour, j, rgen, habermas, has, been, a, major, contributor, to, the, analysis, of, advanced, capitalistic, societies, habermas, observed, four, general, features, that, characterise, advanced, capitalism, corporate, capitalism, is, a, free, or, mixed, market, capitalist, economy, characterized, by, the, dominance, of, hierarchical, bureaucratic, corporations, finance, capitalism, is, the, subordination, of, processes, of, production, to, the, accumulation, of, money, profits, in, a, financial, system, in, their, critique, of, capitalism, marxism, and, leninism, both, emphasise, the, role, of, finance, capital, as, the, determining, and, ruling, class, interest, in, capitalist, society, particularly, in, the, latter, stages, rudolf, hilferding, is, credited, with, first, bringing, the, term, finance, capitalism, into, prominence, through, finance, capital, his, 1910, study, of, the, links, between, german, trusts, banks, and, monopolies, a, study, subsumed, by, vladimir, lenin, into, imperialism, the, highest, stage, of, capitalism, 1917, his, analysis, of, the, imperialist, relations, of, the, great, world, powers, lenin, concluded, that, the, banks, at, that, time, operated, as, the, chief, nerve, centres, of, the, whole, capitalist, system, of, national, economy, for, the, comintern, founded, in, 1919, the, phrase, dictatorship, of, finance, capitalism, became, a, regular, one, fernand, braudel, would, later, point, to, two, earlier, periods, when, finance, capitalism, had, emerged, in, human, history, with, the, genoese, in, the, 16th, century, and, with, the, dutch, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, although, at, those, points, it, developed, from, commercial, capitalism, giovanni, arrighi, extended, braudel, s, analysis, to, suggest, that, a, predominance, of, finance, capitalism, is, a, recurring, long, term, phenomenon, whenever, a, previous, phase, of, commercial, industrial, capitalist, expansion, reaches, a, plateau, a, capitalist, free, market, economy, is, an, economic, system, where, prices, for, goods, and, services, are, set, entirely, by, the, forces, of, supply, and, demand, and, are, expected, by, its, adherents, to, reach, their, point, of, equilibrium, without, intervention, by, government, policy, it, typically, entails, support, for, highly, competitive, markets, and, private, ownership, of, the, means, of, production, laissez, faire, capitalism, is, a, more, extensive, form, of, this, free, market, economy, but, one, in, which, the, role, of, the, state, is, limited, to, protecting, property, rights, in, anarcho, capitalist, theory, property, rights, are, protected, by, private, firms, and, market, generated, law, according, to, anarcho, capitalists, this, entails, property, rights, without, statutory, law, through, market, generated, tort, contract, and, property, law, and, self, sustaining, private, industry, fernand, braudel, argued, that, free, market, exchange, and, capitalism, are, to, some, degree, opposed, free, market, exchange, involves, transparent, public, transactions, and, a, large, number, of, equal, competitors, while, capitalism, involves, a, small, number, of, participants, using, their, capital, to, control, the, market, via, private, transactions, control, of, information, and, limitation, of, competition, mercantilism, is, a, nationalist, form, of, early, capitalism, that, came, into, existence, approximately, in, the, late, 16th, century, it, is, characterized, by, the, intertwining, of, national, business, interests, with, state, interest, and, imperialism, consequently, the, state, apparatus, is, used, to, advance, national, business, interests, abroad, an, example, of, this, is, colonists, living, in, america, who, were, only, allowed, to, trade, with, and, purchase, goods, from, their, respective, mother, countries, e, g, united, kingdom, france, and, portugal, mercantilism, was, driven, by, the, belief, that, the, wealth, of, a, nation, is, increased, through, a, positive, balance, of, trade, with, other, nations, it, corresponds, to, the, phase, of, capitalist, development, sometimes, called, the, primitive, accumulation, of, capital, a, social, market, economy, is, a, free, market, or, mixed, market, capitalist, system, sometimes, classified, as, a, coordinated, market, economy, where, government, intervention, in, price, formation, is, kept, to, a, minimum, but, the, state, provides, significant, services, in, areas, such, as, social, security, health, care, unemployment, benefits, and, the, recognition, of, labor, rights, through, national, collective, bargaining, arrangements, this, model, is, prominent, in, western, and, northern, european, countries, as, well, as, japan, albeit, in, slightly, different, configurations, the, vast, majority, of, enterprises, are, privately, owned, in, this, economic, model, rhine, capitalism, is, the, contemporary, model, of, capitalism, and, adaptation, of, the, social, market, model, that, exists, in, continental, western, europe, today, state, capitalism, is, a, capitalist, market, economy, dominated, by, state, owned, enterprises, where, the, state, enterprises, are, organized, as, commercial, profit, seeking, businesses, the, designation, has, been, used, broadly, throughout, the, 20th, century, to, designate, a, number, of, different, economic, forms, ranging, from, state, ownership, in, market, economies, to, the, command, economies, of, the, former, eastern, bloc, according, to, aldo, musacchio, a, professor, at, harvard, business, school, state, capitalism, is, a, system, in, which, governments, whether, democratic, or, autocratic, exercise, a, widespread, influence, on, the, economy, either, through, direct, ownership, or, various, subsidies, musacchio, notes, a, number, of, differences, between, today, s, state, capitalism, and, its, predecessors, in, his, opinion, gone, are, the, days, when, governments, appointed, bureaucrats, to, run, companies, the, world, s, largest, state, owned, enterprises, are, now, traded, on, the, public, markets, and, kept, in, good, health, by, large, institutional, investors, contemporary, state, capitalism, is, associated, with, the, east, asian, model, of, capitalism, dirigisme, and, the, economy, of, norway, alternatively, merriam, webster, defines, state, capitalism, as, an, economic, system, in, which, private, capitalism, is, modified, by, a, varying, degree, of, government, ownership, and, control, in, socialism, utopian, and, scientific, friedrich, engels, argued, that, state, owned, enterprises, would, characterize, the, final, stage, of, capitalism, consisting, of, ownership, and, management, of, large, scale, production, and, communication, by, the, bourgeois, state, in, his, writings, vladimir, lenin, characterized, the, economy, of, soviet, russia, as, state, capitalist, believing, state, capitalism, to, be, an, early, step, toward, the, development, of, socialism, some, economists, and, left, wing, academics, including, richard, d, wolff, and, noam, chomsky, as, well, as, many, marxist, philosophers, and, revolutionaries, such, as, raya, dunayevskaya, and, c, l, r, james, argue, that, the, economies, of, the, former, soviet, union, and, eastern, bloc, represented, a, form, of, state, capitalism, because, their, internal, organization, within, enterprises, and, the, system, of, wage, labor, remained, intact, the, term, is, not, used, by, austrian, school, economists, to, describe, state, ownership, of, the, means, of, production, the, economist, ludwig, von, mises, argued, that, the, designation, of, state, capitalism, was, a, new, label, for, the, old, labels, of, state, socialism, and, planned, economy, and, differed, only, in, non, essentials, from, these, earlier, designations, welfare, capitalism, is, capitalism, that, includes, social, welfare, policies, today, welfare, capitalism, is, most, often, associated, with, the, models, of, capitalism, found, in, central, mainland, and, northern, europe, such, as, the, nordic, model, social, market, economy, and, rhine, capitalism, in, some, cases, welfare, capitalism, exists, within, a, mixed, economy, but, welfare, states, can, and, do, exist, independently, of, policies, common, to, mixed, economies, such, as, state, interventionism, and, extensive, regulation, a, mixed, economy, is, a, largely, market, based, capitalist, economy, consisting, of, both, private, and, public, ownership, of, the, means, of, production, and, economic, interventionism, through, macroeconomic, policies, intended, to, correct, market, failures, reduce, unemployment, and, keep, inflation, low, the, degree, of, intervention, in, markets, varies, among, different, countries, some, mixed, economies, such, as, france, under, dirigisme, also, featured, a, degree, of, indirect, economic, planning, over, a, largely, capitalist, based, economy, most, modern, capitalist, economies, are, defined, as, mixed, economies, to, some, degree, however, french, economist, thomas, piketty, state, that, capitalist, economies, might, shift, to, a, much, more, laissez, faire, approach, in, the, near, future, eco, capitalism, also, known, as, environmental, capitalism, or, sometimes, green, capitalism, is, the, view, that, capital, exists, in, nature, as, natural, capital, ecosystems, that, have, ecological, yield, on, which, all, wealth, depends, therefore, governments, should, use, market, based, policy, instruments, such, as, a, carbon, tax, to, resolve, environmental, problems, the, term, blue, greens, is, often, applied, to, those, who, espouse, eco, capitalism, eco, capitalism, can, be, thought, of, as, the, right, wing, equivalent, to, red, greens, sustainable, capitalism, is, a, conceptual, form, of, capitalism, based, upon, sustainable, practices, that, seek, to, preserve, humanity, and, the, planet, while, reducing, externalities, and, bearing, a, resemblance, of, capitalist, economic, policy, a, capitalistic, economy, must, expand, to, survive, and, find, new, markets, to, support, this, expansion, capitalist, systems, are, often, destructive, to, the, environment, as, well, as, certain, individuals, without, access, to, proper, representation, however, sustainability, provides, quite, the, opposite, it, implies, not, only, a, continuation, but, a, replenishing, of, resources, sustainability, is, often, thought, of, to, be, related, to, environmentalism, and, sustainable, capitalism, applies, sustainable, principles, to, economic, governance, and, social, aspects, of, capitalism, as, well, the, importance, of, sustainable, capitalism, has, been, more, recently, recognized, but, the, concept, is, not, new, changes, to, the, current, economic, model, would, have, heavy, social, environmental, and, economic, implications, and, require, the, efforts, of, individuals, as, well, as, compliance, of, local, state, and, federal, governments, controversy, surrounds, the, concept, as, it, requires, an, increase, in, sustainable, practices, and, a, marked, decrease, in, current, consumptive, behaviors, this, is, a, concept, of, capitalism, described, in, al, gore, and, david, blood, s, manifesto, for, the, generation, investment, management, to, describe, a, long, term, political, economic, and, social, structure, which, would, mitigate, current, threats, to, the, planet, and, society, according, to, their, manifesto, sustainable, capitalism, would, integrate, the, environmental, social, and, governance, esg, aspects, into, risk, assessment, in, attempt, to, limit, externalities, most, of, the, ideas, they, list, are, related, to, economic, changes, and, social, aspects, but, strikingly, few, are, explicitly, related, to, any, environmental, policy, change, the, accumulation, of, capital, is, the, process, of, making, money, or, growing, an, initial, sum, of, money, through, investment, in, production, capitalism, is, based, on, the, accumulation, of, capital, whereby, financial, capital, is, invested, in, order, to, make, a, profit, and, then, reinvested, into, further, production, in, a, continuous, process, of, accumulation, in, marxian, economic, theory, this, dynamic, is, called, the, law, of, value, capital, accumulation, forms, the, basis, of, capitalism, where, economic,
