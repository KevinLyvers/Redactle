the, caste, system, in, india, is, the, paradigmatic, ethnographic, instance, of, social, classification, based, on, castes, it, has, its, origins, in, ancient, india, and, was, transformed, by, various, ruling, elites, in, medieval, early, modern, and, modern, india, especially, in, the, aftermath, of, the, collapse, of, the, mughal, empire, and, the, establishment, of, the, british, raj, it, is, today, the, basis, of, affirmative, action, programmes, in, india, as, enforced, through, its, constitution, the, caste, system, consists, of, two, different, concepts, varna, and, jati, which, may, be, regarded, as, different, levels, of, analysis, of, this, system, the, caste, system, as, it, exists, today, is, thought, to, be, the, result, of, developments, during, the, collapse, of, the, mughal, era, and, the, rise, of, the, british, colonial, government, in, india, the, british, raj, furthered, this, development, making, rigid, caste, organisation, a, central, mechanism, of, administration, between, 1860, and, 1920, the, british, incorporated, the, indian, caste, system, into, their, system, of, governance, granting, administrative, jobs, and, senior, appointments, only, to, christians, and, people, belonging, to, certain, castes, social, unrest, during, the, 1920s, led, to, a, change, in, this, policy, caste, was, no, longer, used, by, the, colonial, authority, to, functionally, organize, civil, society, this, reflected, changes, in, administrative, practices, understandings, of, expertise, and, the, rise, of, new, european, scholarly, institutions, after, the, 1920s, the, colonial, administration, began, a, policy, of, positive, discrimination, by, reserving, a, certain, percentage, of, government, jobs, for, the, lower, castes, in, 1948, negative, discrimination, on, the, basis, of, caste, was, banned, by, law, and, further, enshrined, in, the, indian, constitution, in, 1950, however, the, system, continues, to, be, practiced, in, parts, of, india, there, are, 3, 000, castes, and, 25, 000, sub, castes, in, india, each, related, to, a, specific, occupation, caste, based, differences, have, also, been, practised, in, other, regions, and, religions, in, the, indian, subcontinent, like, nepalese, buddhism, christianity, islam, judaism, and, sikhism, it, has, been, challenged, by, many, reformist, hindu, movements, sikhism, christianity, and, present, day, neo, buddhism, with, indian, influences, the, caste, system, is, also, practiced, in, bali, after, achieving, independence, in, 1947, india, enacted, many, affirmative, action, policies, for, the, upliftment, of, historically, marginalized, groups, as, enforced, through, its, constitution, these, policies, included, reserving, a, quota, of, places, for, these, groups, in, higher, education, and, government, employment, varna, meaning, type, order, colour, or, class, are, a, framework, for, grouping, people, into, classes, first, used, in, vedic, indian, society, it, is, referred, frequently, in, the, ancient, indian, texts, there, are, four, classes, the, brahmins, priestly, class, the, kshatriyas, rulers, administrators, and, warriors, also, called, rajanyas, the, vaishyas, artisans, merchants, tradesmen, and, farmers, and, the, shudras, labouring, classes, the, varna, categorisation, implicitly, includes, a, fifth, element, those, deemed, to, be, entirely, outside, its, scope, such, as, tribal, people, and, the, untouchables, dalits, in, ancient, texts, jati, meaning, birth, is, mentioned, less, often, and, clearly, distinguished, from, varna, there, are, four, varnas, but, thousands, of, jatis, the, jatis, are, complex, social, groups, that, lack, universally, applicable, definitions, or, characteristics, and, have, been, more, flexible, and, diverse, than, was, previously, often, assumed, certain, scholars, of, caste, have, considered, jati, to, have, its, basis, in, religion, assuming, that, the, sacred, elements, of, life, in, india, envelop, the, secular, aspects, for, example, the, anthropologist, louis, dumont, described, the, ritual, rankings, that, exist, within, the, jati, system, as, being, based, on, the, concepts, of, religious, purity, and, pollution, this, view, has, been, disputed, by, other, scholars, who, believe, it, to, be, a, secular, social, phenomenon, driven, by, the, necessities, of, economics, politics, and, at, times, geography, jeaneane, fowler, says, that, although, some, people, consider, jati, to, be, occupational, segregation, in, reality, the, jati, framework, does, not, preclude, or, prevent, a, member, of, one, caste, from, working, in, another, occupation, a, feature, of, jatis, has, been, endogamy, in, susan, bayly, s, words, that, both, in, the, past, and, for, many, though, not, all, indians, in, more, modern, times, those, born, into, a, given, caste, would, normally, expect, to, find, marriage, partner, within, their, jati, a, 2016, study, based, on, the, dna, analysis, of, unrelated, indians, determined, that, endogamous, jatis, originated, during, the, gupta, empire, jatis, have, existed, in, india, among, hindus, muslims, christians, and, tribal, people, and, there, is, no, clear, linear, order, among, them, the, term, caste, is, derived, from, the, portuguese, word, casta, meaning, race, lineage, breed, and, originally, pure, or, unmixed, stock, or, breed, originally, not, an, indian, word, it, is, now, widely, used, in, english, and, in, indian, languages, closely, translated, to, varna, and, jati, the, sociologist, g, s, ghurye, wrote, in, 1932, that, despite, much, study, by, many, people, we, do, not, possess, a, real, general, definition, of, caste, it, appears, to, me, that, any, attempt, at, definition, is, bound, to, fail, because, of, the, complexity, of, the, phenomenon, on, the, other, hand, much, literature, on, the, subject, is, marred, by, lack, of, precision, about, the, use, of, the, term, ghurye, offered, what, he, thought, was, a, definition, that, could, be, applied, across, india, although, he, acknowledged, that, there, were, regional, variations, on, the, general, theme, his, model, definition, for, caste, included, the, following, six, characteristics, the, above, ghurye, s, model, of, caste, thereafter, attracted, scholarly, criticism, for, relying, on, the, census, reports, produced, by, the, colonial, government, the, superior, inferior, racist, theories, of, h, h, risley, and, for, fitting, his, definition, to, then, prevalent, orientalist, perspectives, on, caste, ghurye, added, in, 1932, that, the, colonial, construction, of, caste, led, to, the, livening, up, divisions, and, lobbying, to, the, british, officials, for, favourable, caste, classification, in, india, for, economic, opportunities, and, this, had, added, new, complexities, to, the, concept, of, caste, graham, chapman, and, others, have, reiterated, the, complexity, and, they, note, that, there, are, differences, between, theoretical, constructs, and, the, practical, reality, ronald, inden, the, indologist, agrees, that, there, has, been, no, universally, accepted, definition, of, caste, for, example, for, some, early, european, documenters, it, was, thought, to, correspond, with, the, endogamous, varnas, referred, to, in, ancient, indian, scripts, and, its, meaning, corresponds, in, the, sense, of, estates, to, later, europeans, of, the, raj, era, it, was, endogamous, jatis, rather, than, varnas, that, represented, caste, such, as, the, 2, 378, jatis, that, colonial, administrators, classified, by, occupation, in, the, early, 20th, century, arvind, sharma, a, professor, of, comparative, religion, notes, that, caste, has, been, used, synonymously, to, refer, to, both, varna, and, jati, but, that, serious, indologists, now, observe, considerable, caution, in, this, respect, because, while, related, the, concepts, are, considered, to, be, distinct, in, this, he, agrees, with, the, indologist, arthur, basham, who, noted, that, the, portuguese, colonists, of, india, used, casta, to, describe, tribes, clans, or, families, the, name, stuck, and, became, the, usual, word, for, the, hindu, social, group, in, attempting, to, account, for, the, remarkable, proliferation, of, castes, in, 18th, and, 19th, century, india, authorities, credulously, accepted, the, traditional, view, that, by, a, process, of, intermarriage, and, subdivision, the, 3, 000, or, more, castes, of, modern, india, had, evolved, from, the, four, primitive, classes, and, the, term, caste, was, applied, indiscriminately, to, both, varna, or, class, and, jati, or, caste, proper, this, is, a, false, terminology, castes, rise, and, fall, in, the, social, scale, and, old, castes, die, out, and, new, ones, are, formed, but, the, four, great, classes, are, stable, there, are, never, more, or, less, than, four, and, for, over, 2, 000, years, their, order, of, precedence, has, not, altered, the, sociologist, andr, beteille, notes, that, while, varna, mainly, played, the, role, of, caste, in, classical, hindu, literature, it, is, jati, that, plays, that, role, in, present, times, varna, represents, a, closed, collection, of, social, orders, whereas, jati, is, entirely, open, ended, thought, of, as, a, natural, kind, whose, members, share, a, common, substance, any, number, of, new, jatis, can, be, added, depending, on, need, such, as, tribes, sects, denominations, religious, or, linguistic, minorities, and, nationalities, thus, caste, is, not, an, accurate, representation, of, jati, in, english, better, terms, would, be, ethnicity, ethnic, identity, and, ethnic, group, sociologist, anne, waldrop, observes, that, while, outsiders, view, the, term, caste, as, a, static, phenomenon, of, stereotypical, tradition, bound, india, empirical, facts, suggest, caste, has, been, a, radically, changing, feature, the, term, means, different, things, to, different, indians, in, the, context, of, politically, active, modern, india, where, job, and, school, quotas, are, reserved, for, affirmative, action, based, on, castes, the, term, has, become, a, sensitive, and, controversial, subject, sociologists, such, as, m, n, srinivas, and, damle, have, debated, the, question, of, rigidity, in, caste, and, believe, that, there, is, considerable, flexibility, and, mobility, in, the, caste, hierarchies, there, are, at, least, two, perspectives, for, the, origins, of, the, caste, system, in, ancient, and, medieval, india, which, focus, on, either, ideological, factors, or, on, socio, economic, factors, the, first, school, has, focused, on, religious, anthropology, and, disregarded, other, historical, evidence, as, secondary, or, derivative, of, this, tradition, the, second, school, has, focused, on, sociological, evidence, and, sought, to, understand, the, historical, circumstances, the, latter, has, criticised, the, former, for, its, caste, origin, theory, claiming, that, it, has, dehistoricized, and, decontextualised, indian, society, according, to, samuel, referencing, george, l, hart, central, aspects, of, the, later, indian, caste, system, may, originate, from, the, ritual, kingship, system, prior, to, the, arrival, of, brahmanism, buddhism, and, jainism, in, india, the, system, is, seen, in, the, south, indian, tamil, literature, from, the, sangam, period, 3rd, bce, 3rd, c, ce, this, theory, discards, the, indo, aryan, varna, model, as, the, basis, of, caste, and, is, centred, on, the, ritual, power, of, the, king, who, was, supported, by, a, group, of, ritual, and, magical, specialists, of, low, social, status, with, their, ritual, occupations, being, considered, polluted, according, to, hart, it, may, be, this, model, that, provided, the, concerns, with, pollution, of, the, members, of, low, status, groups, the, hart, model, for, caste, origin, writes, samuel, envisions, the, ancient, indian, society, consisting, of, a, majority, without, internal, caste, divisions, and, a, minority, consisting, of, a, number, of, small, occupationally, polluted, groups, the, varnas, originated, in, late, vedic, society, c, 1000, 500, bce, the, first, three, groups, brahmins, kshatriyas, and, vaishya, have, parallels, with, other, indo, european, societies, while, the, addition, of, the, shudras, is, probably, a, brahmanical, invention, from, northern, india, the, varna, system, is, propounded, in, revered, hindu, religious, texts, and, understood, as, idealised, human, callings, the, purusha, sukta, of, the, rigveda, and, manusmriti, s, comment, on, it, being, the, oft, cited, texts, counter, to, these, textual, classifications, many, revered, hindu, texts, and, doctrines, question, and, disagree, with, this, system, of, social, classification, scholars, have, questioned, the, varna, verse, in, the, rigveda, noting, that, the, varna, therein, is, mentioned, only, once, the, purusha, sukta, verse, is, now, generally, considered, to, have, been, inserted, at, a, later, date, into, the, rigveda, probably, as, a, charter, myth, stephanie, jamison, and, joel, brereton, professors, of, sanskrit, and, religious, studies, state, there, is, no, evidence, in, the, rigveda, for, an, elaborate, much, subdivided, and, overarching, caste, system, and, the, varna, system, seems, to, be, embryonic, in, the, rigveda, and, both, then, and, later, a, social, ideal, rather, than, a, social, reality, in, contrast, to, the, lack, of, details, about, varna, system, in, the, rigveda, the, manusmriti, includes, an, extensive, and, highly, schematic, commentary, on, the, varna, system, but, it, too, provides, models, rather, than, descriptions, susan, bayly, summarises, that, manusmriti, and, other, scriptures, helped, elevate, brahmins, in, the, social, hierarchy, and, these, were, a, factor, in, the, making, of, the, varna, system, but, the, ancient, texts, did, not, in, some, way, create, the, phenomenon, of, caste, in, india, jeaneane, fowler, a, professor, of, philosophy, and, religious, studies, states, that, it, is, impossible, to, determine, how, and, why, the, jatis, came, into, existence, susan, bayly, on, the, other, hand, suggests, that, the, jati, system, emerged, because, it, offered, a, source, of, advantage, in, an, era, of, pre, independence, poverty, lack, of, institutional, human, rights, volatile, political, environment, and, economic, insecurity, according, to, social, anthropologist, dipankar, gupta, guilds, developed, during, the, mauryan, period, and, crystallised, into, jatis, in, post, mauryan, times, with, the, emergence, of, feudalism, in, india, which, finally, crystallised, during, the, 7th, 12th, centuries, however, other, scholars, dispute, when, and, how, jatis, developed, in, indian, history, barbara, metcalf, and, thomas, metcalf, both, professors, of, history, write, one, of, the, surprising, arguments, of, fresh, scholarship, based, on, inscriptional, and, other, contemporaneous, evidence, is, that, until, relatively, recent, centuries, social, organisation, in, much, of, the, subcontinent, was, little, touched, by, the, four, varnas, nor, were, jati, the, building, blocks, of, society, according, to, basham, ancient, indian, literature, refers, often, to, varnas, but, hardly, if, ever, to, jatis, as, a, system, of, groups, within, the, varnas, he, concludes, that, if, caste, is, defined, as, a, system, of, group, within, the, class, which, are, normally, endogamous, commensal, and, craft, exclusive, we, have, no, real, evidence, of, its, existence, until, comparatively, late, times, a, 2016, study, based, on, the, dna, analysis, of, unrelated, indians, determined, that, endogamous, jatis, originated, during, the, gupta, empire, the, vedic, texts, neither, mention, the, concept, of, untouchable, people, nor, any, practice, of, untouchability, the, rituals, in, the, vedas, ask, the, noble, or, king, to, eat, with, the, commoner, from, the, same, vessel, later, vedic, texts, ridicule, some, professions, but, the, concept, of, untouchability, is, not, found, in, them, the, post, vedic, texts, particularly, manusmriti, mentions, outcastes, and, suggests, that, they, be, ostracised, recent, scholarship, states, that, the, discussion, of, outcastes, in, post, vedic, texts, is, different, from, the, system, widely, discussed, in, colonial, era, indian, literature, and, in, dumont, s, structural, theory, on, caste, system, in, india, patrick, olivelle, a, professor, of, sanskrit, and, indian, religions, and, credited, with, modern, translations, of, vedic, literature, dharma, sutras, and, dharma, sastras, states, that, ancient, and, medieval, indian, texts, do, not, support, the, ritual, pollution, purity, impurity, premise, implicit, in, the, dumont, theory, according, to, olivelle, purity, impurity, is, discussed, in, the, dharma, sastra, texts, but, only, in, the, context, of, the, individual, s, moral, ritual, and, biological, pollution, eating, certain, kinds, of, food, such, as, meat, going, to, bathroom, olivelle, writes, in, his, review, of, post, vedic, sutra, and, shastra, texts, we, see, no, instance, when, a, term, of, pure, impure, is, used, with, reference, to, a, group, of, individuals, or, a, varna, or, caste, the, only, mention, of, impurity, in, the, shastra, texts, from, the, 1st, millennium, is, about, people, who, commit, grievous, sins, and, thereby, fall, out, of, their, varna, these, writes, olivelle, are, called, fallen, people, and, considered, impure, in, the, medieval, indian, texts, the, texts, declare, that, these, sinful, fallen, people, be, ostracised, olivelle, adds, that, the, overwhelming, focus, in, matters, relating, to, purity, impurity, in, the, dharma, sastra, texts, concerns, individuals, irrespective, of, their, varna, affiliation, and, all, four, varnas, could, attain, purity, or, impurity, by, the, content, of, their, character, ethical, intent, actions, innocence, or, ignorance, acts, by, children, stipulations, and, ritualistic, behaviours, dumont, in, his, later, publications, acknowledged, that, ancient, varna, hierarchy, was, not, based, on, purity, impurity, ranking, principle, and, that, the, vedic, literature, is, devoid, of, the, untouchability, concept, in, the, 21st, century, advances, in, ancient, dna, research, enabled, biologists, and, geneticists, to, study, the, antiquity, of, castes, in, india, in, studying, the, degree, of, differentiation, of, each, jati, with, all, others, on, the, basis, of, differences, of, mutation, frequencies, they, identified, a, degree, of, differentiation, that, is, at, least, three, times, greater, than, that, among, european, groups, separated, by, similar, geographic, distances, lacking, genetic, grounds, to, attribute, this, to, differences, in, ancestral, north, indians, ancestry, among, groups, in, the, indian, region, from, which, the, population, came, or, in, social, status, they, examined, the, evidence, for, bottlenecks, in, the, history, of, indian, groups, they, found, identical, long, stretches, of, sequence, between, pairs, of, individuals, within, the, same, group, the, only, explanation, for, which, is, the, pairs, of, individuals, descended, from, ancestors, in, the, last, few, thousands, of, years, who, carried, that, dna, segment, 143, since, the, average, size, of, the, dna, segments, reveals, how, long, ago, in, the, past, the, shared, ancestors, lived, the, study, of, a, data, set, of, more, than, 250, jati, groups, spread, throughout, india, provided, results, that, according, to, the, researchers, told, a, clear, story, approximately, a, third, of, groups, in, india, experienced, population, bottlenecks, as, strong, or, stronger, than, the, ones, found, to, have, occurred, among, similarly, isolated, groups, in, human, history, such, as, the, ashkenazi, jews, or, the, finns, a, phenomenon, exceedingly, old, in, most, cases, in, india, the, ostensibly, undisputed, overall, conclusion, from, ancient, dna, research, among, castes, is, that, rather, than, being, the, invention, of, colonialism, as, dirks, suggested, long, term, endogamy, as, embodied, in, modern, indian, society, in, the, institution, of, caste, has, been, overwhelmingly, important, for, millennia, 145, during, the, early, vedic, period, in, northern, india, when, the, rigveda, was, composed, 1500, 1200, bc, there, were, only, two, varnas, in, the, vedic, society, arya, varna, and, dasa, varna, the, distinction, originally, arose, from, tribal, divisions, the, vedic, people, were, indo, european, speaking, tribes, who, migrated, over, a, period, of, several, centuries, into, northern, south, asia, from, the, bactria, margiana, and, mixed, with, the, indigenous, dravidic, speaking, populations, but, regarded, themselves, as, superior, the, vedic, tribes, regarded, themselves, as, arya, the, noble, ones, and, the, rival, tribes, were, called, dasa, dasyu, and, pani, the, dasas, were, frequent, allies, of, the, aryan, tribes, and, they, were, probably, assimilated, into, the, aryan, society, giving, rise, to, a, class, distinction, many, dasas, were, however, in, a, servile, position, giving, rise, to, the, eventual, meaning, of, dasa, as, servant, or, slave, the, rigvedic, society, was, not, distinguished, by, occupations, many, husbandmen, and, artisans, practised, a, number, of, crafts, the, chariot, maker, rathakara, and, metal, worker, karmara, enjoyed, positions, of, importance, and, no, stigma, was, attached, to, them, similar, observations, hold, for, carpenters, tanners, weavers, and, others, towards, the, end, of, the, atharvaveda, period, new, class, distinctions, emerged, the, erstwhile, dasas, are, renamed, shudras, probably, to, distinguish, them, from, the, new, meaning, of, dasa, as, slave, the, aryas, are, renamed, vis, or, vaishya, meaning, the, members, of, the, tribe, and, the, new, elite, classes, of, brahmins, priests, and, kshatriyas, warriors, are, designated, as, new, varnas, the, shudras, were, not, only, the, erstwhile, dasas, but, also, included, the, aboriginal, tribes, that, were, assimilated, into, the, aryan, society, as, it, expanded, into, gangetic, settlements, this, class, distinction, is, still, reflected, in, the, fact, that, the, upper, castes, have, a, higher, genetic, affinity, to, europeans, while, the, lower, castes, are, more, similar, to, asians, there, is, no, evidence, of, restrictions, regarding, food, and, marriage, during, the, vedic, period, according, to, moorjani, et, al, 2013, co, authored, by, reich, extensive, admixture, took, place, between, 2200, bce, and, 100, ce, 4200, to, 1900, before, present, whereafter, india, shifted, to, a, region, in, which, mixture, was, rare, in, southern, india, endogamy, may, have, set, in, a, 1000, years, earlier, in, an, early, upanishad, shudra, is, referred, to, as, p, an, or, nourisher, suggesting, that, shudras, were, the, tillers, of, the, soil, but, soon, afterwards, shudras, are, not, counted, among, the, tax, payers, and, they, are, said, to, be, given, away, along, with, the, land, when, it, is, gifted, the, majority, of, the, artisans, were, also, reduced, to, the, position, of, shudras, but, there, is, no, contempt, indicated, for, their, work, the, brahmins, and, the, kshatriyas, are, given, a, special, position, in, the, rituals, distinguishing, them, from, both, the, vaishyas, and, the, shudras, the, vaishya, is, said, to, be, oppressed, at, will, and, the, shudra, beaten, at, will, knowledge, of, this, period, is, supplemented, by, pali, buddhist, texts, whereas, the, brahmanical, texts, speak, of, the, four, fold, varna, system, the, buddhist, texts, present, an, alternative, picture, of, the, society, stratified, along, the, lines, of, jati, kula, and, occupation, it, is, likely, that, the, varna, system, while, being, a, part, of, the, brahmanical, ideology, was, not, practically, operative, in, the, society, in, the, buddhist, texts, brahmin, and, kshatriya, are, described, as, jatis, rather, than, varnas, they, were, in, fact, the, jatis, of, high, rank, the, jatis, of, low, rank, were, mentioned, as, chandala, and, occupational, classes, like, bamboo, weavers, hunters, chariot, makers, and, sweepers, the, concept, of, kulas, was, broadly, similar, along, with, brahmins, and, kshatriyas, a, class, called, gahapatis, literally, householders, but, effectively, propertied, classes, was, also, included, among, high, kulas, the, people, of, high, kulas, were, engaged, in, occupations, of, high, rank, viz, agriculture, trade, cattle, keeping, computing, accounting, and, writing, and, those, of, low, kulas, were, engaged, in, low, ranked, occupations, such, as, basket, weaving, and, sweeping, the, gahapatis, were, an, economic, class, of, land, holding, agriculturists, who, employed, dasa, kammakaras, slaves, and, hired, labourers, to, work, on, the, land, the, gahapatis, were, the, primary, taxpayers, of, the, state, this, class, was, apparently, not, defined, by, birth, but, by, individual, economic, growth, while, there, was, an, alignment, between, kulas, and, occupations, at, least, at, the, high, and, low, ends, there, was, no, strict, linkage, between, class, caste, and, occupation, especially, among, those, in, the, middle, range, many, occupations, listed, such, as, accounting, and, writing, were, not, linked, to, jatis, peter, masefield, in, his, review, of, caste, in, india, states, that, anyone, could, in, principle, perform, any, profession, the, texts, state, that, the, brahmin, took, food, from, anyone, suggesting, that, strictures, of, commensality, were, as, yet, unknown, the, nikaya, texts, also, imply, that, endogamy, was, not, mandated, the, contestations, of, the, period, are, also, evident, from, the, texts, describing, dialogues, of, buddha, with, the, brahmins, the, brahmins, maintain, their, divinely, ordained, superiority, and, assert, their, right, to,

india, the, institutions, and, beliefs, which, are, now, often, described, as, the, elements, of, traditional, caste, were, only, just, taking, shape, as, recently, as, the, early, eighteenth,

adi, purana, text, states, there, is, only, one, jati, called, manusyajati, or, the, human, caste, but, divisions, arise, on, account, of, their, different, professions, the, caste, of, kshatriya, arose, according, to, jainism, texts, when, rishabha, procured, weapons, to, serve, the, society, and, assumed, the, powers, of, a, king, while, vaishya, and, shudra, castes, arose, from, different, means, of, livelihood, they, specialised, in, early, and, mid, 20th, century, muslim, historians, such, as, hashimi, in, 1927, and, qureshi, in, 1962, proposed, that, caste, system, was, established, before, the, arrival, of, islam, and, it, and, a, nomadic, savage, lifestyle, in, the, northwest, indian, subcontinent, were, the, primary, cause, why, sindhi, non, muslims, embraced, islam, in, flocks, when, arab, muslim, armies, invaded, the, region, according, to, this, hypothesis, the, mass, conversions, occurred, from, the, lower, caste, hindus, and, mahayana, buddhists, who, had, become, corroded, from, within, by, the, infiltration, of, hindu, beliefs, and, practices, this, theory, is, now, widely, believed, to, be, baseless, and, false, derryl, maclein, a, professor, of, social, history, and, islamic, studies, states, that, historical, evidence, does, not, support, this, theory, that, whatever, evidence, is, available, suggests, that, muslim, institutions, in, north, west, india, legitimised, and, continued, any, inequalities, that, existed, and, that, neither, buddhists, nor, lower, caste, hindus, converted, to, islam, because, they, viewed, islam, to, lack, a, caste, system, conversions, to, islam, were, rare, states, maclein, and, conversions, attested, by, historical, evidence, confirms, that, the, few, who, did, convert, were, brahmin, hindus, theoretically, the, upper, caste, maclein, asserts, that, the, caste, and, conversion, theories, about, indian, society, during, the, islamic, era, are, not, based, on, historical, evidence, or, verifiable, sources, but, rather, on, the, personal, assumptions, of, muslim, historians, about, the, nature, of, islam, hinduism, and, buddhism, in, the, northwest, indian, subcontinent, richard, eaton, a, professor, of, history, at, berkley, asserts, that, the, presumption, of, a, rigid, hindu, caste, system, and, the, oppression, of, lower, castes, in, pre, islamic, era, in, india, is, the, cause, of, mass, conversion, to, islam, during, the, medieval, era, this, claim, has, the, problem, that, no, evidence, can, be, found, in, support, of, the, theory, and, it, is, profoundly, illogical, peter, jackson, a, professor, of, medieval, history, and, muslim, india, writes, that, the, speculative, hypotheses, about, the, caste, system, in, hindu, states, during, the, medieval, delhi, sultanate, period, 1200, to, 1500, and, the, existence, of, a, caste, system, as, being, responsible, for, hindu, weakness, in, resisting, the, plunder, by, islamic, armies, is, appealing, at, first, sight, but, they, do, not, withstand, closer, scrutiny, and, historical, evidence, jackson, states, that, contrary, to, the, theoretical, model, of, caste, where, only, kshatriyas, could, be, warriors, and, soldiers, historical, evidence, confirms, that, hindu, warriors, and, soldiers, during, the, medieval, era, included, members, other, castes, such, as, vaishyas, and, shudras, further, writes, jackson, there, is, no, evidence, that, there, ever, was, a, widespread, conversion, to, islam, at, the, turn, of, twelfth, century, by, hindus, of, lower, caste, jamal, malik, a, professor, of, islamic, studies, extends, this, observation, further, and, states, that, at, no, time, in, history, did, hindus, of, low, caste, convert, en, masse, to, islam, jamal, malik, states, that, caste, as, a, social, stratification, is, a, well, studied, indian, system, yet, evidence, also, suggests, that, hierarchical, concepts, class, consciousness, and, social, stratification, had, already, occurred, in, islam, before, islam, arrived, in, india, the, concept, of, caste, or, qaum, in, islamic, literature, is, mentioned, by, a, few, islamic, historians, of, medieval, india, states, malik, but, these, mentions, relate, to, the, fragmentation, of, the, muslim, society, in, india, zia, al, din, al, barani, of, delhi, sultanate, in, his, fatawa, ye, jahandari, and, abu, al, fadl, from, akbar, s, court, of, mughal, empire, are, the, few, islamic, court, historians, who, mention, caste, zia, al, din, al, barani, s, discussion, however, is, not, about, non, muslim, castes, rather, a, declaration, of, the, supremacy, of, ashraf, caste, over, ardhal, caste, among, the, muslims, justifying, it, in, quranic, text, with, aristocratic, birth, and, superior, genealogy, being, the, most, important, traits, of, a, human, irfan, habib, an, indian, historian, states, that, abu, al, fazl, s, ain, i, akbari, provides, a, historical, record, and, census, of, the, jat, peasant, caste, of, hindus, in, northern, india, where, the, tax, collecting, noble, classes, zamindars, the, armed, cavalry, and, infantry, warrior, class, doubling, up, as, the, farming, peasants, working, class, were, all, of, the, same, jat, caste, in, the, 16th, century, these, occupationally, diverse, members, from, one, caste, served, each, other, writes, habib, either, because, of, their, reaction, to,

collection, in, areas, under, the, islamic, rule, the, origin, of, caste, system, of, modern, form, in, the, bengal, region, of, india, may, be, traceable, to, this, period, states, richard, eaton, the, medieval, era, islamic, sultanates, in, india, utilised, social, stratification, to, rule, and, collect, tax, revenue, from, non, muslims, eaton, states, that, looking, at, bengal, s, hindu, society, as, a, whole, it, seems, likely, that, the, caste, system, far, from, being, the, ancient, and, unchanging, essence, of, indian, civilisation, as, supposed, by, generations, of, orientalists, emerged, into, something, resembling, its, modern, form, only, in, the, period, 1200, 1500, susan, bayly, an, anthropologist, notes, that, caste, is, not, and, never, has, been, a, fixed, fact, of, indian, life, and, the, caste, system, as, we, know, it, today, as, a, ritualised, scheme, of, social, stratification, developed, in, two, stages, during, the, post, mughal, period, in, 18th, and,

exclusion, in, the, indian, subcontinent, states, that, the, criminal, by, birth, castes, under, this, act, included, initially, ahirs, gurjars, and, jats, but, its, enforcement, expanded, by, the, late, 19th, century, to, include, most, shudras, and, untouchables, such, as, chamars, as, well, as, sannyasis, and, hill, tribes, castes, suspected, of, rebelling, against, colonial, laws, and, seeking, self, rule, for, india, such, as, the, previously, ruling, families, kallars, and, the, maravars, in, south, india, and, non, loyal, castes, in, north, india, such, as, ahirs, gurjars, and,

groups, were, presumed, guilty, by, birth, arrested, children, separated, from, their, parents, and, held, in, penal, colonies, or, quarantined, without, conviction, or, due, process, this, practice, became, controversial, did, not, enjoy, the, support, of, all, british, colonial, officials, and, in, a, few, cases, this, decades, long, practice, was, reversed, at, the, start, of, the, 20th, century, with, the, proclamation, that, people, could, not, be, incarcerated, indefinitely, on, the, presumption, of, bad, character, the, criminal, by, birth, laws, against, targeted, castes, was, enforced, until, the, mid, 20th, century, with, an, expansion, of, criminal, castes, list, in, west, and, south, india, through, the, 1900s, to, 1930s, hundreds, of, hindu, communities, were, brought, under, the, criminal, tribes, act, by, 1931, the, colonial, government, included, 237, criminal, castes, and, tribes, under, the, act, in, the, madras, presidency, alone, while, the, notion, of, hereditary, criminals, conformed, to, orientalist, stereotypes, and, the, prevailing, racial, theories, during, the, colonial, era, the, social, impact, of, its, enforcement, was, profiling, division, and, isolation, of, many, communities, of, hindus, as, criminals, by, birth, eleanor, nesbitt, a, professor, of, history, and, religions, in, india, states, that, the, colonial, government, hardened, the, caste, driven, divisions, in, india, not, only, through, its, caste, census, but, with, a, series, of, laws, in, the, early, 20th, century, colonial, officials, for, instance, enacted, laws, such, as, the, land, alienation, act, in, 1900, and, punjab, pre, emption, act, in, 1913, listing, castes, that, could, legally, own, land, and, denying, equivalent, property, rights, to, other, census, determined, castes, these, acts, prohibited, the, inter, generational, and, intra, generational, transfer, of, land, from, land, owning, castes, to, any, non, agricultural, castes, thereby, preventing, economic, mobility, of, property, and, creating, consequent, caste, barriers, in, india, khushwant, singh, a, sikh, historian, and, tony, ballantyne, a, professor, of, history, state, that, these, colonial, era, laws, helped, create, and, erect, barriers, within, land, owning, and, landless, castes, in, northwest, india, caste, based, discrimination, and, denial, of, human, rights, by, the, colonial, state, had, similar, impact, elsewhere, in, india, nicholas, dirks, has, argued, that, indian, caste, as, we, know, it, today, is, a, modern, phenomenon, as, caste, was, fundamentally, transformed, by, british, colonial, rule, according, to, dirks, before, colonial, rule, caste, affiliation, was, quite, loose, and, fluid, but, colonial, rule, enforced, caste, affiliation, rigorously, and, constructed, a, much, more, strict, hierarchy, than, existed, previously, with, some, castes, being, criminalised, and, others, being, given, preferential, treatment, de, zwart, notes, that, the, caste, system, used, to, be, thought, of, as, an, ancient, fact, of, hindu, life, and, that, contemporary, scholars, argue, instead, that, the, system, was, constructed, by, the, colonial, authorities, he, says, that, jobs, and, education, opportunities, were, allotted, based, on, caste, and, people, rallied, and, adopted, a, caste, system, that, maximized, their, opportunity, de, zwart, also, notes, that, post, colonial, affirmative, action, only, reinforced, the, british, colonial, project, that, ex, hypothesi, constructed, the, caste, system, sweetman, notes, that, the, european, conception, of, caste, dismissed, former, political, configurations, and, insisted, upon, an, essentially, religious, character, of, india, during, the, colonial, period, caste, was, defined, as, a, religious, system, and, was, divorced, from, political, powers, this, made, it, possible, for, the, colonial, rulers, to, portray, india, as, a, society, characterised, by, spiritual, harmony, in, contrast, to, the, former, indian, states, which, they, criticised, as, despotic, and, epiphenomenal, with, the, colonial, powers, providing, the, necessary, benevolent, paternalistic, rule, by, a, more, advanced, nation, assumptions, about, the, caste, system, in, indian, society, along, with, its, nature, evolved, during, colonial, rule, corbridge, concludes, that, british, policies, towards, india, s, numerous, princely, sovereign, states, as, well, as, enumeration, of, the, population, into, rigid, categories, during, the, 10, year, census, particularly, with, the, 1901, and, 1911, census, contributed, towards, the, hardening, of, caste, identities, social, unrest, during, 1920s, led, to, a, change, in, this, policy, from, then, on, the, colonial, administration, began, a, policy, of, positive, discrimination, by, reserving, a, certain, percentage, of, government, jobs, for, the, lower, castes, in, the, round, table, conference, held, on, august, 1932, upon, the, request, of, ambedkar, the, then, prime, minister, of, britain, ramsay, macdonald, made, a, communal, award, which, awarded, a, provision, for, separate, representation, for, the, muslims, sikhs, christians, anglo, indians, europeans, and, dalits, these, depressed, classes, were, assigned, a, number, of, seats, to, be, filled, by, election, from, special, constituencies, in, which, voters, belonging, to, the, depressed, classes, only, could, vote, gandhi, went, on, a, hunger, strike, against, this, provision, claiming, that, such, an, arrangement, would, split, the, hindu, community, into, two, groups, years, later, ambedkar, wrote, that, gandhi, s, fast, was, a, form, of, coercion, this, agreement, which, saw, gandhi, end, his, fast, and, ambedkar, drop, his, demand, for, a, separate, electorate, was, called, the, poona, pact, after, india, achieved, independence, the, policy, of, caste, based, reservation, of, jobs, was, formalised, with, lists, of, scheduled, castes, and, scheduled, tribes, smelser, and, lipset, propose, in, their, review, of, hutton, s, study, of, caste, system, in, colonial, india, the, theory, that, individual, mobility, across, caste, lines, may, have, been, minimal, in, india, because, it, was, ritualistic, they, state, that, this, may, be, because, the, colonial, social, stratification, worked, with, the, pre, existing, ritual, caste, system, the, emergence, of, a, caste, system, in, the, modern, form, during, the, early, period, of, british, colonial, rule, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, century, was, not, uniform, in, south, asia, claude, markovits, a, french, historian, of, colonial, india, writes, that, hindu, society, in, north, and, west, india, sindh, in, late, 18th, century, and, much, of, 19th, century, lacked, a, proper, caste, system, their, religious, identities, were, fluid, a, combination, of, saivism, vaisnavism, sikhism, and, the, brahmins, were, not, the, widespread, priestly, group, but, the, bawas, were, markovits, writes, if, religion, was, not, a, structuring, factor, neither, was, caste, among, the, hindu, merchants, group, of, northwest, india, societal, stratification, and, the, inequality, that, comes, with, it, still, exists, in, india, and, has, been, thoroughly, criticised, government, policies, aim, at, reducing, this, inequality, by, reservation, quota, for, backward, classes, but, paradoxically, also, have, created, an, incentive, to, keep, this, stratification, alive, according, to, sociologist, arvind, shah, the, indian, government, officially, recognises, historically, discriminated, communities, of, india, such, as, the, untouchables, under, the, designation, of, scheduled, castes, and, certain, economically, backward, castes, as, other, backward, class, others, however, maintain, that, reservation, on, the, basis, of, caste, is, necessary, in, order, to, prevent, the, monopolization, of, public, sector, jobs, by, members, of, the, upper, castes, these, individuals, also, point, out, that, reservation, in, india, is, not, aimed, primarily, at, eradicating, poverty, but, at, ensuring, adequate, representation, of, all, caste, groups, a, majority, of, marriages, in, india, are, still, endogamous, with, inter, caste, and, inter, religious, marriages, found, mostly, among, those, who, are, economically, educationally, culturally, advanced, and, urban, oriented, a, study, in, 2005, found, that, inter, caste, marriages, had, nearly, doubled, between, 1981, and, 2005, but, only, reaching, the, level, of, 6, 1, opposition, to, intercaste, marriage, also, remains, widespread, with, pew, polling, indicating, that, over, 3, in, 5, indians, agree, that, it, is, very, important, to, stop, both, men, and, women, from, marrying, outside, of, their, castes, the, polling, indicated, furthermore, that, christians, and, buddhists, were, relatively, more, accepting, of, intercaste, marriages, compared, to, hindus, muslims, and, sikhs, honor, killings, related, to, disapproval, of, intercaste, marriages, also, remain, frequent, with, outlook, india, noting, evidence, an, ngo, revealed, in, november, 2019, that, as, many, as, 195, known, cases, of, honour, killings, were, reported, from, tamil, nadu, alone, in, the, past, five, years, the, government, of, india, provides, financial, incentives, to, inter, caste, couples, under, the, dr, ambedkar, scheme, for, social, integration, through, inter, caste, marriages, various, state, governments, such, as, those, of, odisha, haryana, punjab, karnataka, himachal, pradesh, bihar, tamil, nadu, rajasthan, and, maharashtra, also, have, similar, schemes, independent, india, has, witnessed, caste, related, violence, according, to, a, 2005, un, report, approximately, 31, 440, cases, of, violent, acts, committed, against, dalits, were, reported, in, 1996, the, un, report, claimed, 1, 33, cases, of, violent, acts, per, 10, 000, dalit, people, for, context, the, un, reported, between, 40, and, 55, cases, of, violent, acts, per, 10, 000, people, in, developed, countries, in, 2005, one, example, of, such, violence, is, the, khairlanji, massacre, of, 2006, the, scheduled, caste, and, scheduled, tribe, prevention, of, atrocities, act, 1989, of, india, aims, to, prevent, and, punish, atrocities, and, discrimination, against, members, of, the, scheduled, castes, and, scheduled, tribes, examples, of, crimes, punishable, under, the, act, include, forcing, victims, to, eat, or, drink, obnoxious, substances, dumping, excreta, sewage, carcasses, into, their, homes, or, compounds, land, grabbing, humiliation, sexual, abuse, the, national, crime, records, bureau, includes, statistics, of, crimes, reported, under, the, law, as, part, of, it, annual, reports, there, has, been, a, growth, in, total, number, of, crimes, reported, under, the, act, in, recent, years, but, conviction, rates, have, been, low, crimes, against, members, of, scheduled, caste, communities, grew, by, 7, 3, and, against, scheduled, tribes, by, 26, 5, in, 2019, caste, persists, within, the, indian, diaspora, for, example, dalit, people, in, the, united, states, report, experiencing, discrimination, and, violence, in, 2020, the, california, department, of, fair, employment, and, housing, initiated, a, lawsuit, against, cisco, and, two, of, its, employees, for, alleged, discrimination, against, an, indian, engineer, because, he, was, from, a, lower, caste, than, them, according, to, a, 2018, survey, by, civil, rights, group, equality, labs, cited, in, the, lawsuit, 67, of, dalits, reported, being, treated, unfairly, at, their, workplace, because, of, their, caste, the, government, of, the, united, kingdom, ran, a, public, consultation, on, ways, to, ensure, legal, protection, against, caste, discrimination, from, march, 2017, to, september, 2017, based, on, the, consultation, the, government, decided, that, the, best, way, to, provide, the, necessary, protection, against, unlawful, discrimination, because, of, caste, is, by, relying, on, emerging, case, law, as, developed, by, courts, and, tribunals, article, 15, of, the, constitution, of, india, prohibits, discrimination, based, on, caste, and, article, 17, declared, the, practice, of, untouchability, to, be, illegal, in, 1955, india, enacted, the, untouchability, offences, act, renamed, in, 1976, as, the, protection, of, civil, rights, act, it, extended, the, reach, of, law, from, intent, to, mandatory, enforcement, the, scheduled, castes, and, scheduled, tribes, prevention, of, atrocities, act, was, passed, in, india, in, 1989, the, indian, government, officially, recognises, historically, discriminated, communities, of, india, such, as, the, untouchables, under, the, designation, of, scheduled, castes, and, scheduled, tribes, and, certain, economically, backward, shudra, castes, as, other, backward, class, the, scheduled, castes, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, dalit, in, contemporary, literature, in, 2001, dalits, comprised, 16, 2, percent, of, india, s, total, population, of, the, one, billion, hindus, in, india, it, is, estimated, that, hindu, forward, caste, comprises, 26, other, backward, class, comprises, 43, hindu, scheduled, castes, dalits, comprises, 22, and, hindu, scheduled, tribes, adivasis, comprises, 9, in, addition, to, taking, affirmative, action, for, people, of, schedule, castes, and, scheduled, tribes, india, has, expanded, its, effort, to, include, people, from, poor, backward, castes, in, its, economic, and, social, mainstream, in, 1990, the, government, reservation, of, 27, for, backward, classes, on, the, basis, of, the, mandal, commission, s, recommendations, since, then, india, has, reserved, 27, percent, of, job, opportunities, in, government, owned, enterprises, and, agencies, for, socially, and, educationally, backward, classes, sebcs, the, 27, percent, reservation, is, in, addition, to, 22, 5, percent, set, aside, for, india, s, lowest, castes, for, the, last, 50, years, the, mandal, commission, was, established, in, 1979, to, identify, the, socially, or, educationally, backward, and, to, consider, the, question, of, seat, reservations, and, quotas, for, people, to, redress, caste, discrimination, in, 1980, the, commission, s, report, affirmed, the, affirmative, action, practice, under, indian, law, whereby, additional, members, of, lower, castes, the, other, backward, classes, were, given, exclusive, access, to, another, 27, percent, of, government, jobs, and, slots, in, public, universities, in, addition, to, the, 23, percent, already, reserved, for, the, dalits, and, tribals, when, v, p, singh, s, administration, tried, to, implement, the, recommendations, of, the, mandal, commission, in, 1990, massive, protests, were, held, in, the, country, many, alleged, that, the, politicians, were, trying, to, cash, in, on, caste, based, reservations, for, purely, pragmatic, electoral, purposes, there, is, substantial, debate, over, the, exact, number, of, obcs, in, india, it, is, generally, estimated, to, be, sizable, but, many, believe, that, it, is, lower, than, the, figures, quoted, by, either, the, mandal, commission, or, the, national, sample, survey, the, reservation, system, has, led, to, widespread, protests, such, as, the, 2006, indian, anti, reservation, protests, with, many, complaining, of, reverse, discrimination, against, the, forward, castes, the, castes, that, do, not, qualify, for, the, reservation, in, may, 2011, the, government, approved, a, poverty, religion, and, caste, census, to, identify, poverty, in, different, social, backgrounds, the, census, would, also, help, the, government, to, re, examine, and, possibly, undo, some, of, the, policies, which, were, formed, in, haste, such, as, the, mandal, commission, in, order, to, bring, more, objectivity, to, the, policies, with, respect, to, contemporary, realities, critics, of, the, reservation, system, believe, that, there, is, actually, no, social, stigma, at, all, associated, with, belonging, to, a, backward, caste, and, that, because, of, the, huge, constitutional, incentives, in, the, form, of, educational, and, job, reservations, a, large, number, of, people, will, falsely, identify, with, a, backward, caste, to, receive, the, benefits, this, would, not, only, result, in, a, marked, inflation, of, the, backward, castes, numbers, but, also, lead, to, enormous, administrative, and, judicial, resources, being, devoted, to, social, unrest, and, litigation, when, such, dubious, caste, declarations, are, challenged, in, 20th, century, india, the, upper, class, ashraf, muslims, dominated, the, government, jobs, and, parliamentary, representation, as, a, result, there, have, been, campaigns, to, include, the, muslim, untouchable, and, lower, castes, among, the, groups, eligible, for, affirmative, action, in, india, under, sc, and, sts, provision, act, and, have, been, given, additional, reservation, based, on, the, sachar, committee, report, in, a, 2008, study, desai, et, al, focussed, on, education, attainments, of, children, and, young, adults, aged, 6, 29, from, lowest, caste, and, tribal, populations, of, india, they, completed, a, national, survey, of, over, 100, 000, households, for, each, of, the, four, survey, years, between, 1983, and, 2000, they, found, a, significant, increase, in, lower, caste, children, in, their, odds, of, completing, primary, school, the, number, of, dalit, children, who, completed, either, middle, high, or, college, level, education, increased, three, times, faster, than, the, national, average, and, the, total, number, were, statistically, same, for, both, lower, and, upper, castes, however, the, same, study, found, that, in, 2000, the, percentage, of, dalit, males, never, enrolled, in, a, school, was, still, more, than, twice, the, percentage, of, upper, caste, males, never, enrolled, in, schools, moreover, only, 1, 67, of, dalit, females, were, college, graduates, compared, to, 9, 09, of, upper, caste, females, the, number, of, dalit, girls, in, india, who, attended, school, doubled, in, the, same, period, but, was, still, lower, than, the, national, average, other, poor, caste, groups, as, well, as, ethnic, groups, such, as, muslims, in, india, have, also, made, improvements, over, the, 16, year, period, but, their, improvement, lagged, behind, that, of, dalits, and, adivasis, the, net, percentage, school, attainment, for, dalits, and, muslims, were, statistically, the, same, in, 1999, a, 2007, nationwide, survey, of, india, by, the, world, bank, found, that, over, 80, percent, of, children, of, historically, discriminated, castes, were, attending, schools, the, fastest, increase, in, school, attendance, by, dalit, community, children, occurred, during, the, recent, periods, of, india, s, economic, growth, a, study, by, darshan, singh, presents, data, on, health, and, other, indicators, of, socio, economic, change, in, india, s, historically, discriminated, castes, he, claims, the, life, expectancy, of, various, caste, groups, in, modern, india, has, been, raised, but, the, international, institute, for, population, sciences, report, suggests, that, poverty, not, caste, is, the, bigger, differentiation, in, life, expectancy, in, modern, india, while, identified, with, hinduism, caste, systems, are, found, in, other, religions, on, the, indian, subcontinent, including, other, religions, such, as, buddhists, christians, and, muslims, caste, system, has, been, observed, among, muslims, in, india, they, practice, endogamy, hypergamy, hereditary, occupations, avoid, social, mixing, and, have, been, stratified, there, is, some, controversy, if, these, characteristics, make, them, social, groups, or, castes, of, islam, some, scholars, assert, that, the, muslim, castes, are, not, as, acute, in, their, discrimination, as, those, of, the, hindus, while, critics, assert, that, the, discrimination, in, south, asian, muslim, society, is, worse, from, the, earliest, days, of, islam, s, arrival, in, south, asia, arab, persian, and, afghan, muslims, have, been, recognised, as, an, upper, caste, some, upper, caste, hindus, who, converted, to, islam, became, part, of, the, governing, groups, who, along, with, these, foreign, groups, came, to, be, known, as, ashrafs, or, nobles, below, them, are, the, middle, caste, muslims, called, ajlafs, and, the, lowest, status, muslims, of, the, arzals, anti, caste, activists, like, ambedkar, called, the, arzal, caste, among, muslims, as, the, equivalent, of, hindu, untouchables, as, did, the, british, ethnographer, herbert, hope, risley, in, bengal, some, muslims, refer, to, the, social, stratification, within, their, society, as, qaum, or, quoms, a, term, that, is, found, among, muslims, elsewhere, in, india, as, well, as, in, pakistan, and, afghanistan, qaums, have, patrilineal, heredity, with, ranked, occupations, and, endogamy, membership, in, a, qaum, is, inherited, by, birth, barth, identifies, the, origin, of, the, stratification, from, the, historical, segregation, between, pak, pure, and, paleed, impure, defined, by, the, family, s, social, or, religious, status, occupation, and, involvement, in, sexual, crimes, there, is, history, of, skin, color, defining, pak, paleed, but, that, does, not, have, historical, roots, and, was, adopted, by, outsiders, through, analogy, with, the, hindu, caste, system, endogamy, is, very, common, in, muslims, in, the, form, of, arranged, consanguineous, marriages, among, muslims, in, india, and, pakistan, malik, states, that, the, lack, of, religious, sanction, makes, qaum, a, quasi, caste, and, something, that, is, found, in, islam, outside, south, asia, as, well, the, sikh, literature, mentions, varna, as, varan, and, jati, as, zat, or, zat, biradari, eleanor, nesbitt, a, professor, of, religion, and, author, of, books, on, sikhism, states, that, the, varan, is, described, as, a, class, system, while, zat, has, some, caste, system, features, in, sikh, literature, in, theory, sikh, literature, does, not, recognise, caste, hierarchy, or, differences, but, in, practice, states, nesbitt, widespread, endogamy, practices, among, sikhs, have, been, prevalent, in, modern, times, and, poorer, sikhs, of, disadvantaged, castes, continue, to, gather, in, their, own, places, of, worship, most, sikh, families, writes, nesbitt, continue, to, check, the, caste, of, any, prospective, marriage, partner, for, their, children, she, notes, that, all, gurus, of, sikhs, married, within, their, zat, and, they, did, not, condemn, or, break, with, the, convention, of, endogamous, marriages, for, their, own, children, or, sikhs, in, general, although, the, sikh, gurus, criticised, the, hierarchy, of, the, caste, system, one, does, exist, in, sikh, community, according, to, sunrinder, s, jodhka, sikhs, belonging, to, the, landowning, dominant, castes, have, not, shed, all, their, prejudices, against, the, dalits, while, dalits, would, be, allowed, entry, into, the, village, gurudwaras, they, would, not, be, permitted, to, cook, or, serve, langar, the, communal, meal, therefore, wherever, they, could, mobilise, resources, the, dalits, of, punjab, have, tried, to, construct, their, own, gurudwaras, and, other, local, level, institutions, in, order, to, attain, a, certain, degree, of, cultural, autonomy, in, 1953, the, government, of, india, acceded, to, the, demands, of, the, sikh, leader, tara, singh, to, include, sikh, castes, of, the, converted, untouchables, in, the, list, of, scheduled, castes, in, the, shiromani,

if, brahma, wanted, castes, argued, phule, he, would, have, ordained, the, same, for, other, creatures, there, are, no, castes, in, species, of, animals, or, birds, so, why, should, there, be, one, among, human, animals, in, his, criticism, phule, added, brahmins, cannot, claim, superior, status, because, of, caste, because, they, hardly, bothered, with, these, when, wining, and, dining, with, europeans, professions, did, not, make, castes, and, castes, did, not, decide, one, s, profession, if, someone, does, a, job, that, is, dirty, it, does, not, make, them, inferior, in, the, same, way,

and, interpretations, about, the, caste, system, in, india, caste, he, claimed, has, saved, hinduism, from, disintegration, but, like, every, other, institution, it, has, suffered, from, excrescences, he, considered, the, four, divisions, of, varnas, to, be, fundamental, natural, and, essential, the, innumerable, subcastes, or, jatis, he, considered, to, be, a, hindrance, he, advocated, to, fuse, all, the, jatis, into, a, more, global, division, of, varnas, in, the, 1930s, gandhi, began, to, advocate, for, the, idea, of, heredity, in, caste, to, be, rejected, arguing, that, assumption, of, superiority, by, any, person, over, any, other, is, a, sin, against, god, and, man, thus, caste, in, so, far, as, it, connotes, distinctions, in, status, is, an, evil, he, claimed, that, varnashrama, of, the, shastras, is, today, nonexistent, in, practice, the, present, caste, system, is, theory, antithesis, of, varnashrama, caste, in, its, current, form, claimed, gandhi, had, nothing, to, do, with, religion, the, discrimination, and, trauma, of, castes, argued, gandhi, was, the, result, of, custom, the, origin, of, which, is, unknown, gandhi, said, that, the, customs, origin, was, a, moot, point, because, one, could, spiritually, sense, that, these, customs, were, wrong, and, that, any, caste, system, is, harmful, to, the, spiritual, well, being, of, man, and, economic, well, being, of, a, nation, the, reality, of, colonial, india, was, gandhi, noted, that, there, was, no, significant, disparity, between, the, economic, condition, and, earnings, of, members, of, different, castes, whether, it, was, a, brahmin, or, an, artisan, or, a, farmer, of, low, caste, india, was, poor, and, indians, of, all, castes, were, poor, thus, he, argued, that, the, cause, of, trauma, was, not, in, the, caste, system, but, elsewhere, judged, by, the, standards, being, applied, to, india, gandhi, claimed, every, human, society, would, fail, he, acknowledged, that, the, caste, system, in, india, spiritually, blinded, some, indians, then, added, that, this, did, not, mean, that, every, indian, or, even, most, indians, blindly, followed, the, caste, system, or, everything, from, ancient, indian, scriptures, of, doubtful, authenticity, and, value, india, like, any, other, society, cannot, be, judged, by, a, caricature, of, its, worst, specimens, gandhi, stated, that, one, must, consider, the, best, it, produced, as, well, along, with, the, vast, majority, in, impoverished, indian, villages, struggling, to, make, ends, meet, with, woes, of, which, there, was, little, knowledge, b, r, ambedkar, was, born, in, a, caste, that, was, classified, as, untouchable, became, a, leader, of, human, rights, campaigns, in, india, a, prolific, writer, and, a, key, person, in, drafting, modern, india, s, constitution, in, the, 1940s, he, wrote, extensively, on, discrimination, trauma, and, what, he, saw, as, the, tragic, effects, of, the, caste, system, in, india, he, believed, that, the, caste, system, originated, in, the, practice, of, endogamy, and, that, it, spread, through, imitation, by, other, groups, he, wrote, that, initially, brahmins, kshatriyas, vaishyas, and, shudras, existed, as, classes, whose, choice, of, occupation, was, not, restricted, by, birth, and, in, which, exogamy, was, prevalent, brahmins, then, began, to, practise, endogamy, and, enclosed, themselves, hence, ambedkar, defines, caste, as, enclosed, class, he, believed, that, traditions, such, as, sati, enforced, widowhood, and, child, marriage, developed, from, the, need, to, reinforce, endogamy, and, shastras, were, used, to, glorify, these, practices, so, that, they, are, observed, without, being, questioned, later, other, caste, groups, imitated, these, customs, however, although, ambedkar, uses, the, approach, of, psychologist, gabriel, tarde, to, indicate, how, the, caste, system, spread, he, also, explains, that, brahmins, or, manu, cannot, be, blamed, for, the, origin, of, the, caste, system, and, he, discredits, theories, which, trace, the, origin, of, caste, system, in, races, in, 2014, kk, sarachandra, bose, went, on, a, 40, day, bharat, yatra, indian, journey, of, almost, 14, 000, kilometres, 8, 700, mi, from, thiruvananthapuram, to, delhi, along, with, over, 30, volunteers, to, campaign, for, the, end, of, the, caste, system, bose, also, believes, that, using, the, term, caste, conflicts, with, the, 1948, un, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, he, urged, the, government, of, india, for, constitutional, reform, to, remove, all, references, to, the, caste, system, by, december, 2014, many, political, parties, in, india, have, indulged, in, caste, based, votebank, politics, parties, such, as, bahujan, samaj, party, bsp, the, samajwadi, party, and, the, janata, dal, claim, that, they, are, representing, the, backward, castes, and, rely, on, obc, support, often, in, alliance, with, dalit, and, muslim, support, to, win, elections, on, the, other, hand, the, hindu, right, has, also, at, times, courted, controversy, over, its, own, caste, based, appeals, for, example, in, 2020, when, bjp, mp, member, of, parliament, pragya, singh, thakur, came, under, fire, for, comments, she, made, about, shudras, during, an, address, to, a, caste, body, called, the, kshatriya, mahasabha, a, 1995, study, notes, that, the, caste, system, in, india, is, a, system, of, exploitation, of, poor, low, ranking, groups, by, more, prosperous, high, ranking, groups, a, report, published, in, 2001, note, that, in, india, 36, 3, of, people, own, no, land, at, all, 60, 6, own, about, 15, of, the, land, with, a, very, wealthy, 3, 1, owning, 15, of, the, land, haque, also, reports, that, over, 90, percent, of, both, scheduled, castes, low, ranking, groups, and, all, other, castes, high, ranking, groups, either, do, not, own, land, or, own, land, area, capable, of, producing, less, than, 1000, per, year, of, food, and, income, per, household, however, over, 99, percent, of, india, s, farms, are, less, than, 10, hectares, and, 99, 9, percent, of, the, farms, are, less, than, 20, hectares, regardless, of, the, farmer, or, landowner, s, caste, indian, government, has, in, addition, vigorously, pursued, agricultural, land, ceiling, laws, which, prohibit, anyone, from, owning, land, greater, than, mandated, limits, india, has, used, this, law, to, forcibly, acquire, land, from, some, then, redistribute, tens, of, millions, of, acres, to, the, landless, and, poor, of, the, low, caste, haque, suggests, that, indian, lawmakers, need, to, reform, and, modernise, the, nation, s, land, laws, and, rely, less, on, blind, adherence, to, land, ceilings, and, tenancy, reform, in, a, 2011, study, aiyar, too, notes, that, such, qualitative, theories, of, economic, exploitation, and, consequent, land, redistribution, within, india, between, 1950, and, 1990, had, no, effect, on, the, quality, of, life, and, poverty, reduction, instead, economic, reforms, since, the, 1990s, and, resultant, opportunities, for, non, agricultural, jobs, have, reduced, poverty, and, increased, per, capita, income, for, all, segments, of, indian, society, for, specific, evidence, aiyar, mentions, the, following, critics, believe, that, the, economic, liberalisation, has, benefited, just, a, small, elite, and, left, behind, the, poor, especially, the, lowest, hindu, caste, of, dalits, but, a, recent, authoritative, survey, revealed, striking, improvements, in, living, standards, of, dalits, in, the, last, two, decades, television, ownership, was, up, from, zero, to, 45, percent, cellphone, ownership, up, from, zero, to, 36, percent, two, wheeler, ownership, of, motorcycles, scooters, mopeds, up, from, zero, to, 12, 3, percent, children, eating, yesterday, s, leftovers, down, from, 95, 9, percent, to, 16, 2, percent, dalits, running, their, own, businesses, up, from, 6, percent, to, 37, percent, and, proportion, working, as, agricultural, labourers, down, from, 46, 1, percent, to, 20, 5, percent, cassan, has, studied, the, differential, effect, within, two, segments, of, india, s, dalit, community, he, finds, india, s, overall, economic, growth, has, produced, the, fastest, and, more, significant, socio, economic, changes, cassan, further, concludes, that, legal, and, social, program, initiatives, are, no, longer, india, s, primary, constraint, in, further, advancement, of, india, s, historically, discriminated, castes, further, advancement, are, likely, to, come, from, improvements, in, the, supply, of, quality, schools, in, rural, and, urban, india, along, with, india, s, economic, growth, the, maltreatment, of, dalits, in, india, has, been, described, by, anand, teltumbde, gopal, guru, and, others, as, india, s, hidden, apartheid, critics, of, the, accusations, point, to, substantial, improvements, in, the, position, of, dalits, in, post, independence, india, consequent, to, the, strict, implementation, of, the, rights, and, privileges, enshrined, in, the, constitution, of, india, as, implemented, by, the, protection, of, civil, rights, act, 1955, they, also, argue, that, the, practice, had, disappeared, in, urban, public, life, recent, research, by, naveen, bharathi, deepak, malghan, and, andaleeb, rahman, found, that, the, extent, of, intra, village, segregation, in, karnataka, is, greater, than, the, local, black, white, segregation, in, the, american, south, that, continues, to, influence, residential, patterns, to, this, day, they, claim, that, this, finding, agrees, with, previous, ethnographic, research, that, found, that, residential, space, in, rural, india, is, segregated, along, caste, lines, sociologists, kevin, reilly, stephen, kaufman, and, angela, bodino, while, critical, of, caste, system, conclude, that, modern, india, does, not, practice, apartheid, since, there, is, no, state, sanctioned, discrimination, they, write, that, casteism, in, india, is, presently, not, apartheid, in, fact, untouchables, as, well, as, tribal, people, and, members, of, the, lowest, castes, in, india, benefit, from, broad, affirmative, action, programmes, and, are, enjoying, greater, political, power, a, hypothesis, that, caste, amounts, to, race, has, been, rejected, by, some, scholars, ambedkar, for, example, wrote, that, the, brahmin, of, punjab, is, racially, of, the, same, stock, as, the, chamar, of, punjab, the, caste, system, does, not, demarcate, racial, division, the, caste, system, is, a, social, division, of, people, of, the, same, race, various, sociologists, anthropologists, and, historians, have, rejected, the, racial, origins, and, racial, emphasis, of, caste, and, consider, the, idea, to, be, one, that, has, purely, political, and, economic, undertones, beteille, writes, that, the, scheduled, castes, of, india, taken, together, are, no, more, a, race, than, are, the, brahmins, taken, together, every, social, group, cannot, be, regarded, as, a, race, simply, because, we, want, to, protect, it, against, prejudice, and, discrimination, and, that, the, 2001, durban, conference, on, racism, hosted, by, the, u, n, is, turning, its, back, on, established, scientific, opinion, mulk, raj, anand, s, debut, novel, untouchable, 1935, is, based, on, the, theme, of, untouchability, the, debut, novel, of, arundhati, roy, the, god, of, small, things, 1997, also, has, themes, surrounding, the, caste, system, across, religions, a, lawyer, named, sabu, thomas, filed, a, petition, to, have, the, book, published, without, the, last, chapter, which, had, graphic, description, of, sexual, acts, between, members, of, different, castes, thomas, claimed, the, alleged, obscenity, in, the, last, chapter, deeply, hurts, the, syrian, christian, community, the, basis, of, the, novel, the, hindi, film, achhut, kannya, untouchable, maiden, 1936, starring, ashok, kumar, and, devika, rani, was, an, early, reformist, film, since, then, there, are, a, variety, of, films, focusing, on, caste, discrimination, and, the, depiction, of, inter, caste, relations, such, as, sujata, 1959, and, ankur, 1974, the, largest, swell, of, caste, focused, films, with, lower, caste, representation, occurred, from, the, 1960s, until, 1990, during, the, peak, of, parallel, cinema, however, since, the, 1990s, there, is, a, substantial, disparity, in, caste, representation, in, film, due, to, the, rise, of, upper, caste, protagonists, casting, and, participation, in, the, industry, this, can, be, traced, to, the, beginning, of, the, film, industry, which, was, pioneered, by, a, brahmin, dadasaheb, phalke, since, then, while, dalits, tried, to, enter, the, industry, they, were, often, cast, in, side, roles, or, as, villains, in, the, 21st, century, there, are, several, critically, acclaimed, regional, films, known, for, strong, caste, representation, sairat, 2016, and, fandry, 2013, are, both, marathi, language, films, about, inter, caste, romance, and, discrimination, and, are, respected, for, their, dalit, direction, and, honest, depiction, of, lower, caste, experiences, pariyerum, perumal, 2018, is, a, tamil, film, on, caste, violence, and, kabali, 2016, is, an, action, film, starring, rajinikanth, both, directed, by, dalit, filmmaker, pa, ranjith, unlike, regional, films, hindi, films, are, still, dominated, by, upper, caste, filmmakers, and, stories, even, when, they, attempt, to, discuss, caste, discrimination, article, 15, 2019, is, a, crime, thriller, that, stars, a, brahmin, hero, who, helps, dalit, villagers, by, investigating, the, murder, of, two, dalit, girls, and, works, to, erase, caste, discrimination, in, the, police, system, it, was, a, box, office, hit, but, is, criticized, for, its, upper, caste, casting, and, victimization, of, dalits
