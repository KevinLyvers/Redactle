https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altruism
altruism, is, the, principle, and, practice, of, concern, for, the, well, being, and, or, happiness, of, other, humans, or, animals, above, oneself, while, objects, of, altruistic, concern, vary, it, is, an, important, moral, value, in, many, cultures, and, religions, it, may, be, considered, a, synonym, of, selflessness, the, opposite, of, selfishness, the, word, altruism, was, popularized, and, possibly, coined, by, the, french, philosopher, auguste, comte, in, french, as, altruisme, for, an, antonym, of, egoism, he, derived, it, from, the, italian, altrui, which, in, turn, was, derived, from, latin, alteri, meaning, other, people, or, somebody, else, altruism, as, observed, in, populations, of, organisms, is, when, an, individual, performs, an, action, at, a, cost, to, itself, in, terms, of, e, g, pleasure, and, quality, of, life, time, probability, of, survival, or, reproduction, that, benefits, directly, or, indirectly, another, individual, without, the, expectation, of, reciprocity, or, compensation, for, that, action, altruism, can, be, distinguished, from, feelings, of, loyalty, or, concern, for, the, common, good, the, latter, are, predicated, upon, social, relationships, whilst, altruism, does, not, consider, relationships, whether, true, altruism, is, possible, in, human, psychology, is, a, subject, of, debate, the, theory, of, psychological, egoism, suggests, that, no, act, of, sharing, helping, or, sacrificing, can, be, truly, altruistic, as, the, actor, may, receive, an, intrinsic, reward, in, the, form, of, personal, gratification, the, validity, of, this, argument, depends, on, whether, such, intrinsic, rewards, qualify, as, benefits, the, term, altruism, may, also, refer, to, an, ethical, doctrine, that, claims, that, individuals, are, morally, obliged, to, benefit, others, used, in, this, sense, it, is, usually, contrasted, with, egoism, which, claims, individuals, are, morally, obligated, to, serve, themselves, first, effective, altruism, is, the, use, of, evidence, and, reason, to, determine, the, most, effective, ways, to, benefit, others, the, concept, of, altruism, has, a, history, in, philosophical, and, ethical, thought, the, term, was, coined, in, the, 19th, century, by, the, founding, sociologist, and, philosopher, of, science, auguste, comte, and, has, become, a, major, topic, for, psychologists, especially, evolutionary, psychology, researchers, evolutionary, biologists, and, ethologists, whilst, ideas, about, altruism, from, one, field, can, affect, the, other, fields, the, different, methods, and, focuses, of, these, fields, always, lead, to, different, perspectives, on, altruism, in, simple, terms, altruism, is, caring, about, the, welfare, of, other, people, and, acting, to, help, them, above, oneself, marcel, mauss, s, essay, the, gift, contains, a, passage, called, note, on, alms, this, note, describes, the, evolution, of, the, notion, of, alms, and, by, extension, of, altruism, from, the, notion, of, sacrifice, in, it, he, writes, alms, are, the, fruits, of, a, moral, notion, of, the, gift, and, of, fortune, on, the, one, hand, and, of, a, notion, of, sacrifice, on, the, other, generosity, is, an, obligation, because, nemesis, avenges, the, poor, and, the, gods, for, the, superabundance, of, happiness, and, wealth, of, certain, people, who, should, rid, themselves, of, it, this, is, the, ancient, morality, of, the, gift, which, has, become, a, principle, of, justice, the, gods, and, the, spirits, accept, that, the, share, of, wealth, and, happiness, that, has, been, offered, to, them, and, had, been, hitherto, destroyed, in, useless, sacrifices, should, serve, the, poor, and, children, in, the, science, of, ethology, the, study, of, animal, behaviour, and, more, generally, in, the, study, of, social, evolution, altruism, refers, to, behavior, by, an, individual, that, increases, the, fitness, of, another, individual, while, decreasing, the, fitness, of, the, actor, in, evolutionary, psychology, this, term, may, be, applied, to, a, wide, range, of, human, behaviors, such, as, charity, emergency, aid, help, to, coalition, partners, tipping, courtship, gifts, production, of, public, goods, and, environmentalism, theories, of, apparently, altruistic, behavior, were, accelerated, by, the, need, to, produce, ideas, compatible, with, evolutionary, origins, two, related, strands, of, research, on, altruism, have, emerged, from, traditional, evolutionary, analyses, and, evolutionary, game, theory, a, mathematical, model, and, analysis, of, behavioral, strategies, some, of, the, proposed, mechanisms, are, such, explanations, do, not, imply, that, humans, consciously, calculate, how, to, increase, their, inclusive, fitness, when, doing, altruistic, acts, instead, evolution, has, shaped, psychological, mechanisms, such, as, emotions, that, promote, certain, altruistic, behaviors, the, benefits, for, the, altruist, may, be, increased, and, the, costs, reduced, by, being, more, altruistic, towards, certain, groups, research, has, found, that, people, are, more, altruistic, to, kin, than, to, no, kin, to, friends, than, strangers, to, those, attractive, than, to, those, unattractive, to, non, competitors, than, competitors, and, to, members, in, groups, than, to, members, of, out, groups, the, study, of, altruism, was, the, initial, impetus, behind, george, r, price, s, development, of, the, price, equation, a, mathematical, equation, used, to, study, genetic, evolution, an, interesting, example, of, altruism, is, found, in, the, cellular, slime, moulds, such, as, dictyostelium, mucoroides, these, protists, live, as, individual, amoebae, until, starved, at, which, point, they, aggregate, and, form, a, multicellular, fruiting, body, in, which, some, cells, sacrifice, themselves, to, promote, the, survival, of, other, cells, in, the, fruiting, body, selective, investment, theory, proposes, that, close, social, bonds, and, associated, emotional, cognitive, and, neurohormonal, mechanisms, evolved, to, facilitate, long, term, high, cost, altruism, between, those, closely, depending, on, one, another, for, survival, and, reproductive, success, such, cooperative, behaviors, have, sometimes, been, seen, as, arguments, for, left, wing, politics, for, example, by, the, russian, zoologist, and, anarchist, peter, kropotkin, in, his, 1902, book, mutual, aid, a, factor, of, evolution, and, moral, philosopher, peter, singer, in, his, book, a, darwinian, left, jorge, moll, and, jordan, grafman, neuroscientists, at, the, national, institutes, of, health, and, labs, d, or, hospital, network, provided, the, first, evidence, for, the, neural, bases, of, altruistic, giving, in, normal, healthy, volunteers, using, functional, magnetic, resonance, imaging, in, their, research, they, showed, that, both, pure, monetary, rewards, and, charitable, donations, activated, the, mesolimbic, reward, pathway, a, primitive, part, of, the, brain, that, usually, responds, to, food, and, sex, however, when, volunteers, generously, placed, the, interests, of, others, before, their, own, by, making, charitable, donations, another, brain, circuit, was, selectively, activated, the, subgenual, cortex, septal, region, these, structures, are, related, to, social, attachment, and, bonding, in, other, species, the, experiment, suggested, that, altruism, is, not, a, higher, moral, faculty, overpowering, innate, selfish, desires, but, a, fundamental, ingrained, and, enjoyable, trait, in, the, brain, one, brain, region, the, subgenual, anterior, cingulate, cortex, basal, forebrain, contributes, to, learning, altruistic, behavior, especially, in, people, with, trait, empathy, the, same, study, identified, a, link, between, giving, to, charity, and, the, promotion, of, social, bonding, bill, harbaugh, a, university, of, oregon, economist, in, an, fmri, scanner, test, conducted, with, his, psychologist, colleague, dr, ulrich, mayr, reached, the, same, conclusions, as, jorge, moll, and, jordan, grafman, about, giving, to, charity, although, they, were, able, to, divide, the, study, group, into, two, groups, egoists, and, altruists, one, of, their, discoveries, was, that, though, rarely, even, some, of, the, considered, egoists, sometimes, gave, more, than, expected, because, that, would, help, others, leading, to, the, conclusion, that, there, are, other, factors, in, charity, such, as, a, person, s, environment, and, values, a, recent, meta, analysis, of, fmri, studies, conducted, by, shawn, rhoads, jo, cutler, and, abigail, marsh, analyzed, the, results, of, prior, studies, of, generosity, in, which, participants, could, freely, choose, to, give, or, not, give, resources, to, someone, else, the, results, of, this, study, confirmed, that, altruism, is, supported, by, distinct, mechanisms, from, giving, motivated, by, reciprocity, or, by, fairness, this, study, also, confirmed, that, the, right, ventral, striatum, is, recruited, during, altruistic, giving, as, well, as, the, ventromedial, prefrontal, cortex, bilateral, anterior, cingulate, cortex, and, bilateral, anterior, insula, which, are, regions, previously, implicated, in, empathy, abigail, marsh, has, conducted, studies, of, real, world, altruists, that, have, also, identified, an, important, role, for, the, amygdala, in, human, altruism, in, real, world, altruists, such, as, people, who, have, donated, kidneys, to, strangers, the, amygdala, is, larger, than, in, typical, adults, altruists, amygdalas, are, also, more, responsive, than, those, of, typical, adults, to, the, sight, of, others, distress, which, is, thought, to, reflect, an, empathic, response, to, distress, this, structure, may, also, be, involved, in, altruistic, choices, due, to, its, role, in, encoding, the, value, of, outcomes, for, others, this, is, consistent, with, the, findings, of, research, in, non, human, animals, which, has, identified, neurons, within, the, amygdala, that, specifically, encode, the, value, of, others, outcomes, activity, in, which, appears, to, drive, altruistic, choices, in, monkeys, the, international, encyclopedia, of, the, social, sciences, defines, psychological, altruism, as, a, motivational, state, to, increase, another, s, welfare, psychological, altruism, is, contrasted, with, psychological, egoism, which, refers, to, the, motivation, to, increase, one, s, welfare, in, keeping, with, this, research, in, real, world, altruists, including, altruistic, kidney, donors, bone, marrow, donors, humanitarian, aid, workers, and, heroic, rescuers, findings, that, these, altruists, are, primarily, distinguished, from, other, adults, by, unselfish, traits, and, decision, making, patterns, this, suggests, that, human, altruism, reflects, genuinely, high, valuation, of, others, outcomes, there, has, been, some, debate, on, whether, humans, are, capable, of, psychological, altruism, some, definitions, specify, a, self, sacrificial, nature, to, altruism, and, a, lack, of, external, rewards, for, altruistic, behaviors, however, because, altruism, ultimately, benefits, the, self, in, many, cases, the, selflessness, of, altruistic, acts, is, difficult, to, prove, the, social, exchange, theory, postulates, that, altruism, only, exists, when, the, benefits, outweigh, the, costs, to, the, self, daniel, batson, a, psychologist, examined, this, question, and, argued, against, the, social, exchange, theory, he, identified, four, significant, motives, to, ultimately, benefit, the, self, egoism, to, ultimately, benefit, the, other, person, altruism, to, benefit, a, group, collectivism, or, to, uphold, a, moral, principle, principlism, altruism, that, ultimately, serves, selfish, gains, is, thus, differentiated, from, selfless, altruism, but, the, general, conclusion, has, been, that, empathy, induced, altruism, can, be, genuinely, selfless, the, empathy, altruism, hypothesis, states, that, psychological, altruism, exists, and, is, evoked, by, the, empathic, desire, to, help, someone, suffering, feelings, of, empathic, concern, are, contrasted, with, personal, distress, which, compels, people, to, reduce, their, unpleasant, emotions, and, increase, their, positive, ones, by, helping, someone, in, need, empathy, is, thus, not, selfless, since, altruism, works, either, as, a, way, to, avoid, those, negative, unpleasant, feelings, and, have, positive, pleasant, feelings, when, triggered, by, others, need, for, help, or, as, a, way, to, gain, social, reward, or, avoid, social, punishment, by, helping, people, with, empathic, concern, help, others, in, distress, even, when, exposure, to, the, situation, could, be, easily, avoided, whereas, those, lacking, in, empathic, concern, avoid, allowing, it, unless, it, is, difficult, or, impossible, to, avoid, exposure, to, another, s, suffering, helping, behavior, is, seen, in, humans, from, about, two, years, old, when, a, toddler, can, understand, subtle, emotional, cues, in, psychological, research, on, altruism, studies, often, observe, altruism, as, demonstrated, through, prosocial, behaviors, such, as, helping, comforting, sharing, cooperation, philanthropy, and, community, service, people, are, most, likely, to, help, if, they, recognize, that, a, person, is, in, need, and, feel, personal, responsibility, for, reducing, the, person, s, distress, the, number, of, bystanders, witnessing, pain, or, suffering, affects, the, likelihood, of, helping, the, bystander, effect, more, significant, numbers, of, bystanders, decrease, individual, feelings, of, responsibility, however, a, witness, with, a, high, level, of, empathic, concern, is, likely, to, assume, personal, responsibility, entirely, regardless, of, the, number, of, bystanders, many, studies, have, observed, the, effects, of, volunteerism, as, a, form, of, altruism, on, happiness, and, health, and, have, consistently, found, that, those, who, exhibit, volunteerism, also, have, better, current, and, future, health, and, well, being, in, a, study, of, older, adults, those, who, volunteered, had, higher, life, satisfaction, and, will, to, live, and, less, depression, anxiety, and, somatization, volunteerism, and, helping, behavior, have, not, only, been, shown, to, improve, mental, health, but, physical, health, and, longevity, as, well, attributable, to, the, activity, and, social, integration, it, encourages, one, study, examined, the, physical, health, of, mothers, who, volunteered, over, 30, years, and, found, that, 52, of, those, who, did, not, belong, to, a, volunteer, organization, experienced, a, major, illness, while, only, 36, of, those, who, did, volunteer, experienced, one, a, study, on, adults, aged, 55, and, older, found, that, during, the, four, year, study, period, people, who, volunteered, for, two, or, more, organizations, had, a, 63, lower, likelihood, of, dying, after, controlling, for, prior, health, status, it, was, determined, that, volunteerism, accounted, for, a, 44, reduction, in, mortality, merely, being, aware, of, kindness, in, oneself, and, others, is, also, associated, with, greater, well, being, a, study, that, asked, participants, to, count, each, act, of, kindness, they, performed, for, one, week, significantly, enhanced, their, subjective, happiness, happier, people, are, kinder, and, more, grateful, kinder, people, are, happier, and, more, grateful, and, more, grateful, people, are, happier, and, kinder, the, study, suggests, while, research, supports, the, idea, that, altruistic, acts, bring, about, happiness, it, has, also, been, found, to, work, in, the, opposite, direction, that, happier, people, are, also, kinder, the, relationship, between, altruistic, behavior, and, happiness, is, bidirectional, studies, found, that, generosity, increases, linearly, from, sad, to, happy, affective, states, feeling, over, taxed, by, the, needs, of, others, has, negative, effects, on, health, and, happiness, for, example, one, study, on, volunteerism, found, that, feeling, overwhelmed, by, others, demands, had, an, even, stronger, negative, effect, on, mental, health, than, helping, had, a, positive, one, although, positive, effects, were, still, significant, both, genetics, and, environment, have, been, implicated, in, influencing, pro, social, or, altruistic, behavior, candidate, genes, include, oxtr, polymorphisms, in, the, oxytocin, receptor, cd38, comt, drd4, drd5, igf2, avpr1a, and, gabrb2, it, is, theorized, that, some, of, these, genes, influence, altruistic, behavior, by, modulating, levels, of, neurotransmitters, such, as, serotonin, and, dopamine, sociologists, have, long, been, concerned, with, how, to, build, the, good, society, the, structure, of, our, societies, and, how, individuals, come, to, exhibit, charitable, philanthropic, and, other, pro, social, altruistic, actions, for, the, common, good, is, a, commonly, researched, topic, within, the, field, the, american, sociology, association, asa, acknowledges, public, sociology, saying, the, intrinsic, scientific, policy, and, public, relevance, of, this, field, of, investigation, in, helping, to, construct, good, societies, is, unquestionable, this, type, of, sociology, seeks, contributions, that, aid, popular, and, theoretical, understandings, of, what, motivates, altruism, and, how, it, is, organized, and, promotes, an, altruistic, focus, in, order, to, benefit, the, world, and, people, it, studies, how, altruism, is, framed, organized, carried, out, and, what, motivates, it, at, the, group, level, is, an, area, of, focus, that, sociologists, investigate, in, order, to, contribute, back, to, the, groups, it, studies, and, build, the, good, society, the, motivation, of, altruism, is, also, the, focus, of, study, for, example, one, study, links, the, occurrence, of, moral, outrage, to, altruistic, compensation, of, victims, studies, show, that, generosity, in, laboratory, and, in, online, experiments, is, contagious, people, imitate, the, generosity, they, observe, in, others, most, if, not, all, of, the, world, s, religions, promote, altruism, as, a, very, important, moral, value, buddhism, christianity, hinduism, islam, jainism, judaism, and, sikhism, etc, place, particular, emphasis, on, altruistic, morality, altruism, figures, prominently, in, buddhism, love, and, compassion, are, components, of, all, forms, of, buddhism, and, are, focused, on, all, beings, equally, love, is, the, wish, that, all, beings, be, happy, and, compassion, is, the, wish, that, all, beings, be, free, from, suffering, many, illnesses, can, be, cured, by, the, one, medicine, of, love, and, compassion, these, qualities, are, the, ultimate, source, of, human, happiness, and, the, need, for, them, lies, at, the, very, core, of, our, being, dalai, lama, the, notion, of, altruism, is, modified, in, such, a, world, view, since, the, belief, is, that, such, a, practice, promotes, the, practitioner, s, own, happiness, the, more, we, care, for, the, happiness, of, others, the, greater, our, own, sense, of, well, being, becomes, dalai, lama, in, buddhism, a, person, s, actions, cause, karma, which, consists, of, consequences, proportional, to, the, moral, implications, of, their, actions, deeds, considered, to, be, bad, are, punished, while, those, considered, to, be, good, are, rewarded, the, fundamental, principles, of, jainism, revolve, around, altruism, not, only, for, humans, but, for, all, sentient, beings, jainism, preaches, ahimsa, to, live, and, let, live, not, harming, sentient, beings, i, e, uncompromising, reverence, for, all, life, it, also, considers, all, living, things, to, be, equal, the, first, tirthankara, rishabhdev, introduced, the, concept, of, altruism, for, all, living, beings, from, extending, knowledge, and, experience, to, others, to, donation, giving, oneself, up, for, others, non, violence, and, compassion, for, all, living, things, the, principle, of, nonviolence, seeks, to, minimize, karmas, which, limit, the, capabilities, of, the, soul, jainism, views, every, soul, as, worthy, of, respect, because, it, has, the, potential, to, become, siddha, god, in, jainism, because, all, living, beings, possess, a, soul, great, care, and, awareness, is, essential, in, one, s, actions, jainism, emphasizes, the, equality, of, all, life, advocating, harmlessness, towards, all, whether, the, creatures, are, great, or, small, this, policy, extends, even, to, microscopic, organisms, jainism, acknowledges, that, every, person, has, different, capabilities, and, capacities, to, practice, and, therefore, accepts, different, levels, of, compliance, for, ascetics, and, householders, thomas, aquinas, interprets, you, should, love, your, neighbour, as, yourself, as, meaning, that, love, for, ourselves, is, the, exemplar, of, love, for, others, considering, that, the, love, with, which, a, man, loves, himself, is, the, form, and, root, of, friendship, he, quotes, aristotle, that, the, origin, of, friendly, relations, with, others, lies, in, our, relations, to, ourselves, aquinas, concluded, that, though, we, are, not, bound, to, love, others, more, than, ourselves, we, naturally, seek, the, common, good, the, good, of, the, whole, more, than, any, private, good, the, good, of, a, part, however, he, thought, we, should, love, god, more, than, ourselves, and, our, neighbours, and, more, than, our, bodily, life, since, the, ultimate, purpose, of, loving, our, neighbour, is, to, share, in, eternal, beatitude, a, more, desirable, thing, than, bodily, well, being, in, coining, the, word, altruism, as, stated, above, comte, was, probably, opposing, this, thomistic, doctrine, which, is, present, in, some, theological, schools, within, catholicism, the, aim, and, focus, of, christian, life, is, a, life, that, glorifies, god, with, obeying, christ, s, command, to, treat, others, equally, caring, for, them, and, understanding, eternity, in, heaven, is, what, jesus, resurrection, at, calvary, was, all, about, many, biblical, authors, draw, a, strong, connection, between, love, of, others, and, love, of, god, 1, john, 4, states, that, for, one, to, love, god, one, must, love, his, fellowman, and, that, hatred, of, one, s, fellowman, is, the, same, as, hatred, of, god, thomas, jay, oord, has, argued, in, several, books, that, altruism, is, but, one, possible, form, of, love, an, altruistic, action, is, not, always, a, loving, action, oord, defines, altruism, as, acting, for, the, other, s, good, and, he, agrees, with, feminists, who, note, that, sometimes, love, requires, acting, for, one, s, own, good, when, the, other, s, demands, undermine, overall, well, being, german, philosopher, max, scheler, distinguishes, two, ways, in, which, the, strong, can, help, the, weak, one, way, is, a, sincere, expression, of, christian, love, motivated, by, a, powerful, feeling, of, security, strength, and, inner, salvation, of, the, invincible, fullness, of, one, s, own, life, and, existence, 88, 89, another, way, is, merely, one, of, the, many, modern, substitutes, for, love, nothing, but, the, urge, to, turn, away, from, oneself, and, to, lose, oneself, in, other, people, s, business, 95, 96, at, its, worst, scheler, says, love, for, the, small, the, poor, the, weak, and, the, oppressed, is, really, disguised, hatred, repressed, envy, an, impulse, to, detract, etc, directed, against, the, opposite, phenomena, wealth, strength, power, largesse, 96, 97, in, the, arabic, language, iythar, means, preferring, others, to, oneself, on, the, topic, of, donating, blood, to, non, muslims, a, controversial, topic, within, the, faith, the, shia, religious, professor, fadhil, al, milani, has, provided, theological, evidence, that, makes, it, positively, justifiable, in, fact, he, considers, it, a, form, of, religious, sacrifice, and, ithar, altruism, for, sufis, iythar, means, devotion, to, others, through, complete, forgetfulness, of, one, s, own, concerns, where, concern, for, others, is, deemed, as, a, demand, made, by, god, on, the, human, body, considered, to, be, property, of, god, alone, the, importance, of, iythar, aka, th, r, lies, in, sacrifice, for, the, sake, of, the, greater, good, islam, considers, those, practicing, th, r, as, abiding, by, the, highest, degree, of, nobility, this, is, similar, to, the, notion, of, chivalry, a, constant, concern, for, god, results, in, a, careful, attitude, towards, people, animals, and, other, things, in, this, world, judaism, defines, altruism, as, the, desired, goal, of, creation, rabbi, abraham, isaac, kook, stated, that, love, is, the, most, important, attribute, in, humanity, love, is, defined, as, bestowal, or, giving, which, is, the, intention, of, altruism, this, can, be, altruism, towards, humanity, that, leads, to, altruism, towards, the, creator, or, god, kabbalah, defines, god, as, the, force, of, giving, in, existence, rabbi, moshe, chaim, luzzatto, focused, on, the, purpose, of, creation, and, how, the, will, of, god, was, to, bring, creation, into, perfection, and, adhesion, with, this, force, of, giving, modern, kabbalah, developed, by, rabbi, yehuda, ashlag, in, his, writings, about, the, future, generation, focuses, on, how, society, could, achieve, an, altruistic, social, framework, 120, 130, ashlag, proposed, that, such, a, framework, is, the, purpose, of, creation, and, everything, that, happens, is, to, raise, humanity, to, the, level, of, altruism, love, for, one, another, ashlag, focused, on, society, and, its, relation, to, divinity, 175, 180, altruism, is, essential, to, the, sikh, religion, the, central, faith, in, sikhism, is, that, the, greatest, deed, anyone, can, do, is, to, imbibe, and, live, the, godly, qualities, like, love, affection, sacrifice, patience, harmony, and, truthfulness, sev, or, selfless, service, to, the, community, for, its, own, sake, is, an, important, concept, in, sikhism, the, fifth, guru, arjun, dev, sacrificed, his, life, to, uphold, 22, carats, of, pure, truth, the, greatest, gift, to, humanity, the, guru, granth, the, ninth, guru, tegh, bahadur, sacrificed, his, head, to, protect, weak, and, defenseless, people, against, atrocity, in, the, late, seventeenth, century, guru, gobind, singh, the, tenth, guru, in, sikhism, was, at, war, with, the, mughal, rulers, to, protect, the, people, of, different, faiths, when, a, fellow, sikh, bhai, kanhaiya, attended, the, troops, of, the, enemy, he, gave, water, to, both, friends, and, foes, who, were, wounded, on, the, battlefield, some, of, the, enemy, began, to, fight, again, and, some, sikh, warriors, were, annoyed, by, bhai, kanhaiya, as, he, was, helping, their, enemy, sikh, soldiers, brought, bhai, kanhaiya, before, guru, gobind, singh, and, complained, of, his, action, that, they, considered, counterproductive, to, their, struggle, on, the, battlefield, what, were, you, doing, and, why, asked, the, guru, i, was, giving, water, to, the, wounded, because, i, saw, your, face, in, all, of, them, replied, bhai, kanhaiya, the, guru, responded, then, you, should, also, give, them, ointment, to, heal, their, wounds, you, were, practicing, what, you, were, coached, in, the, house, of, the, guru, under, the, tutelage, of, the, guru, bhai, kanhaiya, subsequently, founded, a, volunteer, corps, for, altruism, which, is, still, engaged, today, in, doing, good, to, others, and, in, training, new, recruits, for, this, service, in, hinduism, selflessness, atmatyag, love, prema, kindness, daya, and, forgiveness, kshama, are, considered, as, the, highest, acts, of, humanity, or, manushyattva, giving, alms, to, the, beggars, or, poor, people, is, considered, as, a, divine, act, or, punya, and, hindus, believe, it, will, free, their, souls, from, guilt, or, paapa, and, will, led, them, to, heaven, or, swarga, in, afterlife, altruism, is, also, the, central, act, of, various, hindu, mythology, and, religious, poems, and, songs, mass, donation, of, clothes, to, poor, people, vastraseva, or, blood, donation, camp, or, mass, food, donation, annaseva, for, poor, people, is, common, in, various, hindu, religious, ceremonies, the, bhagavad, gita, supports, the, doctrine, of, karma, yoga, achieving, oneness, with, god, through, action, nishkam, karma, or, action, without, expectation, desire, for, personal, gain, which, can, be, said, to, encompass, altruism, altruistic, acts, are, generally, celebrated, and, very, well, received, in, hindu, literature, and, are, central, to, hindu, morality, there, is, a, wide, range, of, philosophical, views, on, humans, obligations, or, motivations, to, act, altruistically, proponents, of, ethical, altruism, maintain, that, individuals, are, morally, obligated, to, act, altruistically, the, opposing, view, is, ethical, egoism, which, maintains, that, moral, agents, should, always, act, in, their, own, self, interest, both, ethical, altruism, and, ethical, egoism, contrast, with, utilitarianism, which, maintains, that, each, agent, should, act, in, order, to, maximise, the, efficacy, of, their, function, and, the, benefit, to, both, themselves, and, their, co, inhabitants, a, related, concept, in, descriptive, ethics, is, psychological, egoism, the, thesis, that, humans, always, act, in, their, own, self, interest, and, that, true, altruism, is, impossible, rational, egoism, is, the, view, that, rationality, consists, in, acting, in, one, s, self, interest, without, specifying, how, this, affects, one, s, moral, obligations, effective, altruism, is, a, philosophy, and, social, movement, that, uses, evidence, and, reasoning, to, determine, the, most, effective, ways, to, benefit, others, effective, altruism, encourages, individuals, to, consider, all, causes, and, actions, and, to, act, in, the, way, that, brings, about, the, greatest, positive, impact, based, upon, their, values, it, is, the, broad, evidence, based, and, cause, neutral, approach, that, distinguishes, effective, altruism, from, traditional, altruism, or, charity, effective, altruism, is, part, of, the, larger, movement, towards, evidence, based, practices, while, a, substantial, proportion, of, effective, altruists, have, focused, on, the, nonprofit, sector, the, philosophy, of, effective, altruism, applies, more, broadly, to, prioritizing, the, scientific, projects, companies, and, policy, initiatives, which, can, be, estimated, to, save, lives, help, people, or, otherwise, have, the, biggest, benefit, people, associated, with, the, movement, include, philosopher, peter, singer, facebook, co, founder, dustin, moskovitz, cari, tuna, oxford, based, researchers, william, macaskill, and, toby, ord, and, professional, poker, player, liv, boeree, pathological, altruism, is, altruism, taken, to, an, unhealthy, extreme, such, that, it, either, harms, the, altruistic, person, or, the, person, s, well, intentioned, actions, cause, more, harm, than, good, the, term, pathological, altruism, was, popularised, by, the, book, pathological, altruism, examples, include, depression, and, burnout, seen, in, healthcare, professionals, an, unhealthy, focus, on, others, to, the, detriment, of, one, s, own, needs, animal, hoarding, and, ineffective, philanthropic, and, social, programs, that, ultimately, worsen, the, situations, they, are, meant, to, aid, extreme, altruism, also, known, as, costly, altruism, extraordinary, altruism, or, heroic, behaviours, shall, be, distinguished, from, heroism, refers, to, selfless, acts, directed, to, a, stranger, which, significantly, exceed, the, normal, altruistic, behaviours, often, involving, risks, or, great, cost, to, the, altruists, themselves, since, acts, of, extreme, altruism, are, often, directed, towards, strangers, many, commonly, accepted, models, of, simple, altruism, appear, inadequate, in, explaining, this, phenomenon, one, of, the, initial, concepts, was, introduced, by, wilson, in, 1976, which, he, referred, to, as, hard, core, altruism, this, form, is, characterised, by, impulsive, actions, directed, towards, others, typically, a, stranger, and, lacking, incentives, for, reward, since, then, several, papers, have, mentioned, the, possibility, of, such, altruism, the, current, slow, progress, in, the, field, is, due, to, general, ethical, guidelines, that, restrict, exposing, research, participants, to, costly, or, risky, decisions, consequently, much, research, has, based, their, studies, on, living, organ, donations, and, the, actions, of, carnegie, hero, medal, recipients, actions, which, involve, high, risk, high, cost, and, are, of, infrequent, occurrences, a, typical, example, of, extreme, altruism, would, be, non, directed, kidney, donation, a, living, person, donating, one, of, their, kidneys, to, a, stranger, without, any, benefits, or, knowing, the, recipient, however, current, research, can, only, be, carried, out, on, a, small, population, that, meets, the, requirements, of, extreme, altruism, most, of, the, time, the, research, is, also, via, the, form, of, self, report, which, could, lead, to, self, report, biases, due, to, the, limitations, the, current, gap, between, high, stakes, and, normal, altruism, remains, unknown, in, 1970, schwartz, hypothesised, that, extreme, altruism, is, positively, related, to, a, person, s, moral, norms, and, is, not, influenced, by, the, cost, associated, with, the, action, this, hypothesis, was, supported, in, the, same, study, examining, bone, marrow, donors, schwartz, discovered, that, individuals, with, strong, personal, norms, and, those, who, attribute, more, responsibility, to, themselves, are, more, inclined, to, participate, in, bone, marrow, donation, similar, findings, were, observed, in, a, 1986, study, by, piliavin, and, libby, focusing, on, blood, donors, these, studies, suggest, that, personal, norms, lead, to, the, activation, of, moral, norms, leading, individuals, to, feel, compelled, to, help, others, abigail, marsh, has, described, psychopaths, as, the, opposite, group, of, people, to, extreme, altruists, and, has, conducted, a, few, research, comparing, these, two, groups, of, individuals, utilising, techniques, such, as, brain, imaging, and, behavioural, experiments, marsh, s, team, observed, that, kidney, donors, tend, to, have, larger, amygdala, sizes, and, exhibit, better, abilities, in, recognizing, fearful, expressions, compared, to, psychopathic, individuals, furthermore, an, improved, ability, to, recognize, fear, has, been, associated, with, an, increase, in, prosocial, behaviours, including, greater, charity, contribution, rand, and, epstein, explored, the, behaviours, of, 51, carnegie, hero, medal, recipients, demonstrating, how, extreme, altruistic, behaviours, often, stem, from, system, i, of, the, dual, process, theory, which, leads, to, rapid, and, intuitive, behaviours, additionally, a, separate, by, carlson, et, al, indicated, that, such, prosocial, behaviours, are, prevalent, in, emergencies, where, immediate, actions, are, required, this, discovery, has, led, to, ethical, debates, particularly, in, the, context, of, living, organ, donation, where, laws, regarding, this, issue, differ, by, country, as, observed, in, extreme, altruists, these, decisions, are, made, intuitively, which, may, reflect, insufficient, consideration, critics, are, concerned, about, whether, this, rapid, decision, encompasses, a, thorough, cost, benefit, analysis, and, question, the, appropriateness, of, exposing, donors, to, such, risk, one, finding, suggests, how, extreme, altruists, exhibit, lower, levels, of, social, discounting, as, compared, to, others, with, that, meaning, extreme, altruists, place, a, higher, value, on, the, welfare, of, strangers, than, a, typical, person, does, analysis, of, 676, carnegie, hero, award, recipients, and, another, study, on, 243, rescuing, acts, reveal, that, a, significant, proportion, of, rescuers, come, from, lower, socio, economic, backgrounds, johnson, attributes, the, distribution, to, the, high, risk, occupations, that, are, more, prevalent, between, lower, socioeconomic, groups, another, hypothesis, proposed, by, lyons, is, that, individuals, from, these, groups, may, perceive, they, have, less, to, lose, when, engaging, in, high, risk, extreme, altruistic, behaviours, evolutionary, theories, such, as, the, kin, selection, reciprocity, vested, interest, and, punishment, either, contradict, or, do, not, fully, explain, the, concept, of, extreme, altruism, as, a, result, considerable, research, has, attempted, for, a, separate, explanation, for, this, behaviour, research, suggests, that, males, are, more, likely, to, engage, in, heroic, and, risk, taking, behaviours, due, to, a, preference, among, females, for, such, traits, these, extreme, altruistic, behaviours, could, serve, to, act, as, an, unconscious, signal, to, showcase, superior, power, and, ability, compared, to, ordinary, individuals, when, an, extreme, altruist, survives, a, high, risk, situation, they, send, an, honest, signal, of, quality, three, qualities, hypothesized, to, be, exhibited, by, extreme, altruists, which, could, be, interpreted, as, signals, are, 1, traits, that, are, difficult, to, fake, 2, a, willingness, to, help, and, 3, generous, behaviours, the, empathy, altruism, hypothesis, appears, to, align, with, the, concept, of, extreme, altruism, without, contradiction, the, hypothesis, was, supported, with, further, brain, scanning, research, which, indicates, how, this, group, of, people, demonstrate, a, higher, level, of, empathy, concern, the, level, of, empathy, concern, then, triggers, activation, in, specific, brain, regions, urging, the, individual, to, engage, in, heroic, behaviours, while, most, altruistic, behaviours, offer, some, form, of, benefit, extreme, altruism, may, sometimes, result, from, a, mistake, where, the, victim, does, not, reciprocate, considering, the, impulsive, characteristic, of, extreme, altruists, some, researchers, suggest, that, these, individuals, have, made, a, wrong, judgement, during, the, cost, benefit, analysis, furthermore, extreme, altruism, might, be, a, rare, variation, of, altruism, where, they, lie, towards, to, ends, of, a, normal, distribution, in, the, us, the, annual, prevalence, rate, per, capita, is, less, than, 0, 00005, this, shows, the, rarity, of, such, behaviours, digital, altruism, is, the, notion, that, some, are, willing, to, freely, share, information, based, on, the, principle, of, reciprocity, and, in, the, belief, that, in, the, end, everyone, benefits, from, sharing, information, via, the, internet, there, are, three, types, of, digital, altruism, 1, everyday, digital, altruism, involving, expedience, ease, moral, engagement, and, conformity, 2, creative, digital, altruism, involving, creativity, heightened, moral, engagement, and, cooperation, and, 3, co, creative, digital, altruism, involving, creativity, moral, engagement, and, meta, cooperative, efforts
