law, is, a, set, of, rules, that, are, created, and, are, enforceable, by, social, or, governmental, institutions, to, regulate, behavior, with, its, precise, definition, a, matter, of, longstanding, debate, it, has, been, variously, described, as, a, science, and, as, the, art, of, justice, state, enforced, laws, can, be, made, by, a, group, legislature, or, by, a, single, legislator, resulting, in, statutes, by, the, executive, through, decrees, and, regulations, or, established, by, judges, through, precedent, usually, in, common, law, jurisdictions, private, individuals, may, create, legally, binding, contracts, including, arbitration, agreements, that, adopt, alternative, ways, of, resolving, disputes, to, standard, court, litigation, the, creation, of, laws, themselves, may, be, influenced, by, a, constitution, written, or, tacit, and, the, rights, encoded, therein, the, law, shapes, politics, economics, history, and, society, in, various, ways, and, also, serves, as, a, mediator, of, relations, between, people, legal, systems, vary, between, jurisdictions, with, their, differences, analysed, in, comparative, law, in, civil, law, jurisdictions, a, legislature, or, other, central, body, codifies, and, consolidates, the, law, in, common, law, systems, judges, may, make, binding, case, law, through, precedent, although, on, occasion, this, may, be, overturned, by, a, higher, court, or, the, legislature, historically, religious, law, has, influenced, secular, matters, and, is, as, of, the, 21st, century, still, in, use, in, some, religious, communities, sharia, law, based, on, islamic, principles, is, used, as, the, primary, legal, system, in, several, countries, including, iran, and, saudi, arabia, the, scope, of, law, can, be, divided, into, two, domains, public, law, concerns, government, and, society, including, constitutional, law, administrative, law, and, criminal, law, while, private, law, deals, with, legal, disputes, between, parties, in, areas, such, as, contracts, property, torts, delicts, and, commercial, law, this, distinction, is, stronger, in, civil, law, countries, particularly, those, with, a, separate, system, of, administrative, courts, by, contrast, the, public, private, law, divide, is, less, pronounced, in, common, law, jurisdictions, law, provides, a, source, of, scholarly, inquiry, into, legal, history, philosophy, economic, analysis, and, sociology, law, also, raises, important, and, complex, issues, concerning, equality, fairness, and, justice, the, word, law, attested, in, old, english, as, lagu, comes, from, the, old, norse, word, l, g, the, singular, form, lag, meant, something, laid, or, fixed, while, its, plural, meant, law, but, what, after, all, is, a, law, when, i, say, that, the, object, of, laws, is, always, general, i, mean, that, law, considers, subjects, en, masse, and, actions, in, the, abstract, and, never, a, particular, person, or, action, on, this, view, we, at, once, see, that, it, can, no, longer, be, asked, whose, business, it, is, to, make, laws, since, they, are, acts, of, the, general, will, nor, whether, the, prince, is, above, the, law, since, he, is, a, member, of, the, state, nor, whether, the, law, can, be, unjust, since, no, one, is, unjust, to, himself, nor, how, we, can, be, both, free, and, subject, to, the, laws, since, they, are, but, registers, of, our, wills, jean, jacques, rousseau, the, social, contract, ii, 6, the, philosophy, of, law, is, commonly, known, as, jurisprudence, normative, jurisprudence, asks, what, should, law, be, while, analytic, jurisprudence, asks, what, is, law, there, have, been, several, attempts, to, produce, a, universally, acceptable, definition, of, law, in, 1972, baron, hampstead, suggested, that, no, such, definition, could, be, produced, mccoubrey, and, white, said, that, the, question, what, is, law, has, no, simple, answer, glanville, williams, said, that, the, meaning, of, the, word, law, depends, on, the, context, in, which, that, word, is, used, he, said, that, for, example, early, customary, law, and, municipal, law, were, contexts, where, the, word, law, had, two, different, and, irreconcilable, meanings, thurman, arnold, said, that, it, is, obvious, that, it, is, impossible, to, define, the, word, law, and, that, it, is, also, equally, obvious, that, the, struggle, to, define, that, word, should, not, ever, be, abandoned, it, is, possible, to, take, the, view, that, there, is, no, need, to, define, the, word, law, e, g, let, s, forget, about, generalities, and, get, down, to, cases, one, definition, is, that, law, is, a, system, of, rules, and, guidelines, which, are, enforced, through, social, institutions, to, govern, behaviour, in, the, concept, of, law, h, l, a, hart, argued, that, law, is, a, system, of, rules, john, austin, said, law, was, the, command, of, a, sovereign, backed, by, the, threat, of, a, sanction, ronald, dworkin, describes, law, as, an, interpretive, concept, to, achieve, justice, in, his, text, titled, law, s, empire, and, joseph, raz, argues, law, is, an, authority, to, mediate, people, s, interests, oliver, wendell, holmes, defined, law, as, the, prophecies, of, what, the, courts, will, do, in, fact, and, nothing, more, pretentious, in, his, treatise, on, law, thomas, aquinas, argues, that, law, is, a, rational, ordering, of, things, which, concern, the, common, good, that, is, promulgated, by, whoever, is, charged, with, the, care, of, the, community, this, definition, has, both, positivist, and, naturalist, elements, definitions, of, law, often, raise, the, question, of, the, extent, to, which, law, incorporates, morality, john, austin, s, utilitarian, answer, was, that, law, is, commands, backed, by, threat, of, sanctions, from, a, sovereign, to, whom, people, have, a, habit, of, obedience, natural, lawyers, on, the, other, hand, such, as, jean, jacques, rousseau, argue, that, law, reflects, essentially, moral, and, unchangeable, laws, of, nature, the, concept, of, natural, law, emerged, in, ancient, greek, philosophy, concurrently, and, in, connection, with, the, notion, of, justice, and, re, entered, the, mainstream, of, western, culture, through, the, writings, of, thomas, aquinas, notably, his, treatise, on, law, hugo, grotius, the, founder, of, a, purely, rationalistic, system, of, natural, law, argued, that, law, arises, from, both, a, social, impulse, as, aristotle, had, indicated, and, reason, immanuel, kant, believed, a, moral, imperative, requires, laws, be, chosen, as, though, they, should, hold, as, universal, laws, of, nature, jeremy, bentham, and, his, student, austin, following, david, hume, believed, that, this, conflated, the, is, and, what, ought, to, be, problem, bentham, and, austin, argued, for, law, s, positivism, that, real, law, is, entirely, separate, from, morality, kant, was, also, criticised, by, friedrich, nietzsche, who, rejected, the, principle, of, equality, and, believed, that, law, emanates, from, the, will, to, power, and, cannot, be, labeled, as, moral, or, immoral, in, 1934, the, austrian, philosopher, hans, kelsen, continued, the, positivist, tradition, in, his, book, the, pure, theory, of, law, kelsen, believed, that, although, law, is, separate, from, morality, it, is, endowed, with, normativity, meaning, we, ought, to, obey, it, while, laws, are, positive, is, statements, e, g, the, fine, for, reversing, on, a, highway, is, 500, law, tells, us, what, we, should, do, thus, each, legal, system, can, be, hypothesised, to, have, a, basic, norm, german, grundnorm, instructing, us, to, obey, kelsen, s, major, opponent, carl, schmitt, rejected, both, positivism, and, the, idea, of, the, rule, of, law, because, he, did, not, accept, the, primacy, of, abstract, normative, principles, over, concrete, political, positions, and, decisions, therefore, schmitt, advocated, a, jurisprudence, of, the, exception, state, of, emergency, which, denied, that, legal, norms, could, encompass, all, of, the, political, experience, later, in, the, 20th, century, h, l, a, hart, attacked, austin, for, his, simplifications, and, kelsen, for, his, fictions, in, the, concept, of, law, hart, argued, law, is, a, system, of, rules, divided, into, primary, rules, of, conduct, and, secondary, ones, rules, addressed, to, officials, to, administer, primary, rules, secondary, rules, are, further, divided, into, rules, of, adjudication, to, resolve, legal, disputes, rules, of, change, allowing, laws, to, be, varied, and, the, rule, of, recognition, allowing, laws, to, be, identified, as, valid, two, of, hart, s, students, continued, the, debate, in, his, book, law, s, empire, ronald, dworkin, attacked, hart, and, the, positivists, for, their, refusal, to, treat, law, as, a, moral, issue, dworkin, argues, that, law, is, an, interpretive, concept, that, requires, judges, to, find, the, best, fitting, and, most, just, solution, to, a, legal, dispute, given, their, anglo, american, constitutional, traditions, joseph, raz, on, the, other, hand, defended, the, positivist, outlook, and, criticised, hart, s, soft, social, thesis, approach, in, the, authority, of, law, raz, argues, that, law, is, authority, identifiable, purely, through, social, sources, and, without, reference, to, moral, reasoning, in, his, view, any, categorisation, of, rules, beyond, their, role, as, authoritative, instruments, in, mediation, are, best, left, to, sociology, rather, than, jurisprudence, the, history, of, law, links, closely, to, the, development, of, civilization, ancient, egyptian, law, dating, as, far, back, as, 3000, bc, was, based, on, the, concept, of, ma, at, and, characterised, by, tradition, rhetorical, speech, social, equality, and, impartiality, by, the, 22nd, century, bc, the, ancient, sumerian, ruler, ur, nammu, had, formulated, the, first, law, code, which, consisted, of, casuistic, statements, if, then, around, 1760, bc, king, hammurabi, further, developed, babylonian, law, by, codifying, and, inscribing, it, in, stone, hammurabi, placed, several, copies, of, his, law, code, throughout, the, kingdom, of, babylon, as, stelae, for, the, entire, public, to, see, this, became, known, as, the, codex, hammurabi, the, most, intact, copy, of, these, stelae, was, discovered, in, the, 19th, century, by, british, assyriologists, and, has, since, been, fully, transliterated, and, translated, into, various, languages, including, english, italian, german, and, french, the, old, testament, dates, back, to, 1280, bc, and, takes, the, form, of, moral, imperatives, as, recommendations, for, a, good, society, the, small, greek, city, state, ancient, athens, from, about, the, 8th, century, bc, was, the, first, society, to, be, based, on, broad, inclusion, of, its, citizenry, excluding, women, and, enslaved, people, however, athens, had, no, legal, science, or, single, word, for, law, relying, instead, on, the, three, way, distinction, between, divine, law, th, mis, human, decree, nomos, and, custom, d, k, yet, ancient, greek, law, contained, major, constitutional, innovations, in, the, development, of, democracy, roman, law, was, heavily, influenced, by, greek, philosophy, but, its, detailed, rules, were, developed, by, professional, jurists, and, were, highly, sophisticated, over, the, centuries, between, the, rise, and, decline, of, the, roman, empire, law, was, adapted, to, cope, with, the, changing, social, situations, and, underwent, major, codification, under, theodosius, ii, and, justinian, i, although, codes, were, replaced, by, custom, and, case, law, during, the, early, middle, ages, roman, law, was, rediscovered, around, the, 11th, century, when, medieval, legal, scholars, began, to, research, roman, codes, and, adapt, their, concepts, to, the, canon, law, giving, birth, to, the, jus, commune, latin, legal, maxims, called, brocards, were, compiled, for, guidance, in, medieval, england, royal, courts, developed, a, body, of, precedent, which, later, became, the, common, law, a, europe, wide, law, merchant, was, formed, so, that, merchants, could, trade, with, common, standards, of, practice, rather, than, with, the, many, splintered, facets, of, local, laws, the, law, merchant, a, precursor, to, modern, commercial, law, emphasised, the, freedom, to, contract, and, alienability, of, property, as, nationalism, grew, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, the, law, merchant, was, incorporated, into, countries, local, law, under, new, civil, codes, the, napoleonic, and, german, codes, became, the, most, influential, in, contrast, to, english, common, law, which, consists, of, enormous, tomes, of, case, law, codes, in, small, books, are, easy, to, export, and, easy, for, judges, to, apply, however, today, there, are, signs, that, civil, and, common, law, are, converging, eu, law, is, codified, in, treaties, but, develops, through, de, facto, precedent, laid, down, by, the, european, court, of, justice, ancient, india, and, china, represent, distinct, traditions, of, law, and, have, historically, had, independent, schools, of, legal, theory, and, practice, the, arthashastra, probably, compiled, around, 100, ad, although, it, contains, older, material, and, the, manusmriti, c, 100, 300, ad, were, foundational, treatises, in, india, and, comprise, texts, considered, authoritative, legal, guidance, manu, s, central, philosophy, was, tolerance, and, pluralism, and, was, cited, across, southeast, asia, during, the, muslim, conquests, in, the, indian, subcontinent, sharia, was, established, by, the, muslim, sultanates, and, empires, most, notably, mughal, empire, s, fatawa, e, alamgiri, compiled, by, emperor, aurangzeb, and, various, scholars, of, islam, in, india, the, hindu, legal, tradition, along, with, islamic, law, were, both, supplanted, by, common, law, when, india, became, part, of, the, british, empire, malaysia, brunei, singapore, and, hong, kong, also, adopted, the, common, law, system, the, eastern, asia, legal, tradition, reflects, a, unique, blend, of, secular, and, religious, influences, japan, was, the, first, country, to, begin, modernising, its, legal, system, along, western, lines, by, importing, parts, of, the, french, but, mostly, the, german, civil, code, this, partly, reflected, germany, s, status, as, a, rising, power, in, the, late, 19th, century, similarly, traditional, chinese, law, gave, way, to, westernisation, towards, the, final, years, of, the, qing, dynasty, in, the, form, of, six, private, law, codes, based, mainly, on, the, japanese, model, of, german, law, today, taiwanese, law, retains, the, closest, affinity, to, the, codifications, from, that, period, because, of, the, split, between, chiang, kai, shek, s, nationalists, who, fled, there, and, mao, zedong, s, communists, who, won, control, of, the, mainland, in, 1949, the, current, legal, infrastructure, in, the, people, s, republic, of, china, was, heavily, influenced, by, soviet, socialist, law, which, essentially, prioritises, administrative, law, at, the, expense, of, private, law, rights, due, to, rapid, industrialisation, today, china, is, undergoing, a, process, of, reform, at, least, in, terms, of, economic, if, not, social, and, political, rights, a, new, contract, code, in, 1999, represented, a, move, away, from, administrative, domination, furthermore, after, negotiations, lasting, fifteen, years, in, 2001, china, joined, the, world, trade, organization, in, general, legal, systems, can, be, split, between, civil, law, and, common, law, systems, modern, scholars, argue, that, the, significance, of, this, distinction, has, progressively, declined, the, numerous, legal, transplants, typical, of, modern, law, result, in, the, sharing, of, many, features, traditionally, considered, typical, of, either, common, law, or, civil, law, the, third, type, of, legal, system, is, religious, law, based, on, scriptures, the, specific, system, that, a, country, is, ruled, by, is, often, determined, by, its, history, connections, with, other, countries, or, its, adherence, to, international, standards, the, sources, that, jurisdictions, adopt, as, authoritatively, binding, are, the, defining, features, of, any, legal, system, civil, law, is, the, legal, system, used, in, most, countries, around, the, world, today, in, civil, law, the, sources, recognised, as, authoritative, are, primarily, legislation, especially, codifications, in, constitutions, or, statutes, passed, by, government, and, custom, codifications, date, back, millennia, with, one, early, example, being, the, babylonian, codex, hammurabi, modern, civil, law, systems, essentially, derive, from, legal, codes, issued, by, byzantine, emperor, justinian, i, in, the, 6th, century, which, were, rediscovered, by, 11th, century, italy, roman, law, in, the, days, of, the, roman, republic, and, empire, was, heavily, procedural, and, lacked, a, professional, legal, class, instead, a, lay, magistrate, iudex, was, chosen, to, adjudicate, decisions, were, not, published, in, any, systematic, way, so, any, case, law, that, developed, was, disguised, and, almost, unrecognised, each, case, was, to, be, decided, afresh, from, the, laws, of, the, state, which, mirrors, the, theoretical, unimportance, of, judges, decisions, for, future, cases, in, civil, law, systems, today, from, 529, to, 534, ad, the, byzantine, emperor, justinian, i, codified, and, consolidated, roman, law, up, until, that, point, so, that, what, remained, was, one, twentieth, of, the, mass, of, legal, texts, from, before, this, became, known, as, the, corpus, juris, civilis, as, one, legal, historian, wrote, justinian, consciously, looked, back, to, the, golden, age, of, roman, law, and, aimed, to, restore, it, to, the, peak, it, had, reached, three, centuries, before, the, justinian, code, remained, in, force, in, the, east, until, the, fall, of, the, byzantine, empire, western, europe, meanwhile, relied, on, a, mix, of, the, theodosian, code, and, germanic, customary, law, until, the, justinian, code, was, rediscovered, in, the, 11th, century, which, scholars, at, the, university, of, bologna, used, to, interpret, their, own, laws, civil, law, codifications, based, closely, on, roman, law, alongside, some, influences, from, religious, laws, such, as, canon, law, continued, to, spread, throughout, europe, until, the, enlightenment, then, in, the, 19th, century, both, france, with, the, code, civil, and, germany, with, the, b, rgerliches, gesetzbuch, modernised, their, legal, codes, both, these, codes, heavily, influenced, not, only, the, law, systems, of, the, countries, in, continental, europe, but, also, the, japanese, and, korean, legal, traditions, today, countries, that, have, civil, law, systems, range, from, russia, and, turkey, to, most, of, central, and, latin, america, in, common, law, legal, systems, decisions, by, courts, are, explicitly, acknowledged, as, law, on, equal, footing, with, legislative, statutes, and, executive, regulations, the, doctrine, of, precedent, or, stare, decisis, latin, for, to, stand, by, decisions, means, that, decisions, by, higher, courts, bind, lower, courts, to, assure, that, similar, cases, reach, similar, results, in, contrast, in, civil, law, systems, legislative, statutes, are, typically, more, detailed, and, judicial, decisions, are, shorter, and, less, detailed, because, the, adjudicator, is, only, writing, to, decide, the, single, case, rather, than, to, set, out, reasoning, that, will, guide, future, courts, common, law, originated, from, england, and, has, been, inherited, by, almost, every, country, once, tied, to, the, british, empire, except, malta, scotland, the, u, s, state, of, louisiana, and, the, canadian, province, of, quebec, in, medieval, england, during, the, norman, conquest, the, law, varied, shire, to, shire, based, on, disparate, tribal, customs, the, concept, of, a, common, law, developed, during, the, reign, of, henry, ii, during, the, late, 12th, century, when, henry, appointed, judges, that, had, authority, to, create, an, institutionalised, and, unified, system, of, law, common, to, the, country, the, next, major, step, in, the, evolution, of, the, common, law, came, when, king, john, was, forced, by, his, barons, to, sign, a, document, limiting, his, authority, to, pass, laws, this, great, charter, or, magna, carta, of, 1215, also, required, that, the, king, s, entourage, of, judges, hold, their, courts, and, judgments, at, a, certain, place, rather, than, dispensing, autocratic, justice, in, unpredictable, places, about, the, country, a, concentrated, and, elite, group, of, judges, acquired, a, dominant, role, in, law, making, under, this, system, and, compared, to, its, european, counterparts, the, english, judiciary, became, highly, centralised, in, 1297, for, instance, while, the, highest, court, in, france, had, fifty, one, judges, the, english, court, of, common, pleas, had, five, this, powerful, and, tight, knit, judiciary, gave, rise, to, a, systematised, process, of, developing, common, law, as, time, went, on, many, felt, that, the, common, law, was, overly, systematised, and, inflexible, and, increasing, numbers, of, citizens, petitioned, the, king, to, override, the, common, law, on, the, king, s, behalf, the, lord, chancellor, started, giving, judgments, to, do, what, was, equitable, in, a, case, from, the, time, of, sir, thomas, more, the, first, lawyer, to, be, appointed, as, lord, chancellor, a, systematic, body, of, equity, grew, up, alongside, the, rigid, common, law, and, developed, its, own, court, of, chancery, at, first, equity, was, often, criticised, as, erratic, over, time, courts, of, equity, developed, solid, principles, especially, under, lord, eldon, in, the, 19th, century, in, england, and, in, 1937, in, the, u, s, the, two, systems, were, merged, in, developing, the, common, law, academic, writings, have, always, played, an, important, part, both, to, collect, overarching, principles, from, dispersed, case, law, and, to, argue, for, change, william, blackstone, from, around, 1760, was, the, first, scholar, to, collect, describe, and, teach, the, common, law, but, merely, in, describing, scholars, who, sought, explanations, and, underlying, structures, slowly, changed, the, way, the, law, actually, worked, religious, law, is, explicitly, based, on, religious, precepts, examples, include, the, jewish, halakha, and, islamic, sharia, both, of, which, translate, as, the, path, to, follow, christian, canon, law, also, survives, in, some, church, communities, often, the, implication, of, religion, for, law, is, unalterability, because, the, word, of, god, cannot, be, amended, or, legislated, against, by, judges, or, governments, nonetheless, most, religious, jurisdictions, rely, on, further, human, elaboration, to, provide, for, thorough, and, detailed, legal, systems, for, instance, the, quran, has, some, law, and, it, acts, as, a, source, of, further, law, through, interpretation, qiyas, reasoning, by, analogy, ijma, consensus, and, precedent, this, is, mainly, contained, in, a, body, of, law, and, jurisprudence, known, as, sharia, and, fiqh, respectively, another, example, is, the, torah, or, old, testament, in, the, pentateuch, or, five, books, of, moses, this, contains, the, basic, code, of, jewish, law, which, some, israeli, communities, choose, to, use, the, halakha, is, a, code, of, jewish, law, that, summarizes, some, of, the, talmud, s, interpretations, a, number, of, countries, are, sharia, jurisdictions, israeli, law, allows, litigants, to, use, religious, laws, only, if, they, choose, canon, law, is, only, in, use, by, members, of, the, catholic, church, the, eastern, orthodox, church, and, the, anglican, communion, canon, law, ancient, greek, romanized, kanon, lit, a, straight, measuring, rod, a, ruler, is, a, set, of, ordinances, and, regulations, made, by, ecclesiastical, authority, for, the, government, of, a, christian, organisation, or, church, and, its, members, it, is, the, internal, ecclesiastical, law, governing, the, catholic, church, the, eastern, orthodox, church, the, oriental, orthodox, churches, and, the, individual, national, churches, within, the, anglican, communion, the, way, that, such, church, law, is, legislated, interpreted, and, at, times, adjudicated, varies, widely, among, these, three, bodies, of, churches, in, all, three, traditions, a, canon, was, originally, a, rule, adopted, by, a, church, council, these, canons, formed, the, foundation, of, canon, law, the, catholic, church, has, the, oldest, continuously, functioning, legal, system, in, the, western, world, predating, the, evolution, of, modern, european, civil, law, and, common, law, systems, the, 1983, code, of, canon, law, governs, the, latin, church, sui, juris, the, eastern, catholic, churches, which, developed, different, disciplines, and, practices, are, governed, by, the, code, of, canons, of, the, eastern, churches, the, canon, law, of, the, catholic, church, influenced, the, common, law, during, the, medieval, period, through, its, preservation, of, roman, law, doctrine, such, as, the, presumption, of, innocence, roman, catholic, canon, law, is, a, fully, developed, legal, system, with, all, the, necessary, elements, courts, lawyers, judges, a, fully, articulated, legal, code, principles, of, legal, interpretation, and, coercive, penalties, though, it, lacks, civilly, binding, force, in, most, secular, jurisdictions, until, the, 18th, century, sharia, law, was, practiced, throughout, the, muslim, world, in, a, non, codified, form, with, the, ottoman, empire, s, mecelle, code, in, the, 19th, century, being, a, first, attempt, at, codifying, elements, of, sharia, law, since, the, mid, 1940s, efforts, have, been, made, in, country, after, country, to, bring, sharia, law, more, into, line, with, modern, conditions, and, conceptions, in, modern, times, the, legal, systems, of, many, muslim, countries, draw, upon, both, civil, and, common, law, traditions, as, well, as, islamic, law, and, custom, the, constitutions, of, certain, muslim, states, such, as, egypt, and, afghanistan, recognise, islam, as, the, religion, of, the, state, obliging, legislature, to, adhere, to, sharia, saudi, arabia, recognises, the, quran, as, its, constitution, and, is, governed, on, the, basis, of, islamic, law, iran, has, also, witnessed, a, reiteration, of, islamic, law, into, its, legal, system, after, 1979, during, the, last, few, decades, one, of, the, fundamental, features, of, the, movement, of, islamic, resurgence, has, been, the, call, to, restore, the, sharia, which, has, generated, a, vast, amount, of, literature, and, affected, world, politics, socialist, law, is, the, legal, systems, in, communist, states, such, as, the, former, soviet, union, and, the, people, s, republic, of, china, academic, opinion, is, divided, on, whether, it, is, a, separate, system, from, civil, law, given, major, deviations, based, on, marxist, leninist, ideology, such, as, subordinating, the, judiciary, to, the, executive, ruling, party, there, are, distinguished, methods, of, legal, reasoning, applying, the, law, and, methods, of, interpreting, construing, the, law, the, former, are, legal, syllogism, which, holds, sway, in, civil, law, legal, systems, analogy, which, is, present, in, common, law, legal, systems, especially, in, the, us, and, argumentative, theories, that, occur, in, both, systems, the, latter, are, different, rules, directives, of, legal, interpretation, such, as, directives, of, linguistic, interpretation, teleological, interpretation, or, systemic, interpretation, as, well, as, more, specific, rules, for, instance, golden, rule, or, mischief, rule, there, are, also, many, other, arguments, and, cannons, of, interpretation, which, altogether, make, statutory, interpretation, possible, law, professor, and, former, united, states, attorney, general, edward, h, levi, noted, that, the, basic, pattern, of, legal, reasoning, is, reasoning, by, example, that, is, reasoning, by, comparing, outcomes, in, cases, resolving, similar, legal, questions, in, a, u, s, supreme, court, case, regarding, procedural, efforts, taken, by, a, debt, collection, company, to, avoid, errors, justice, sotomayor, cautioned, that, legal, reasoning, is, not, a, mechanical, or, strictly, linear, process, jurimetrics, is, the, formal, application, of, quantitative, methods, especially, probability, and, statistics, to, legal, questions, the, use, of, statistical, methods, in, court, cases, and, law, review, articles, has, grown, massively, in, importance, in, the, last, few, decades, it, is, a, real, unity, of, them, all, in, one, and, the, same, person, made, by, covenant, of, every, man, with, every, man, in, such, manner, as, if, every, man, should, say, to, every, man, i, authorise, and, give, up, my, right, of, governing, myself, to, this, man, or, to, this, assembly, of, men, on, this, condition, that, thou, givest, up, thy, right, to, him, and, authorise, all, his, actions, in, like, manner, thomas, hobbes, leviathan, xvii, the, main, institutions, of, law, in, industrialised, countries, are, independent, courts, representative, parliaments, an, accountable, executive, the, military, and, police, bureaucratic, organisation, the, legal, profession, and, civil, society, itself, john, locke, in, his, two, treatises, of, government, and, baron, de, montesquieu, in, the, spirit, of, the, laws, advocated, for, a, separation, of, powers, between, the, political, legislature, and, executive, bodies, their, principle, was, that, no, person, should, be, able, to, usurp, all, powers, of, the, state, in, contrast, to, the, absolutist, theory, of, thomas, hobbes, leviathan, sun, yat, sen, s, five, power, constitution, for, the, republic, of, china, took, the, separation, of, powers, further, by, having, two, additional, branches, of, government, a, control, yuan, for, auditing, oversight, and, an, examination, yuan, to, manage, the, employment, of, public, officials, max, weber, and, others, reshaped, thinking, on, the, extension, of, state, modern, military, policing, and, bureaucratic, power, over, ordinary, citizens, daily, lives, pose, special, problems, for, accountability, that, earlier, writers, such, as, locke, or, montesquieu, could, not, have, foreseen, the, custom, and, practice, of, the, legal, profession, is, an, important, part, of, people, s, access, to, justice, whilst, civil, society, is, a, term, used, to, refer, to, the, social, institutions, communities, and, partnerships, that, form, law, s, political, basis, a, judiciary, is, a, number, of, judges, mediating, disputes, to, determine, outcome, most, countries, have, systems, of, appeal, courts, with, an, apex, court, as, the, ultimate, judicial, authority, in, the, united, states, this, authority, is, the, supreme, court, in, australia, the, high, court, in, india, the, supreme, court, of, india, in, the, uk, the, supreme, court, in, germany, the, bundesverfassungsgericht, and, in, france, the, cour, de, cassation, for, most, european, countries, the, european, court, of, justice, in, luxembourg, can, overrule, national, law, when, eu, law, is, relevant, the, european, court, of, human, rights, in, strasbourg, allows, citizens, of, the, council, of, europe, member, states, to, bring, cases, relating, to, human, rights, issues, before, it, some, countries, allow, their, highest, judicial, authority, to, overrule, legislation, they, determine, to, be, unconstitutional, for, example, in, brown, v, board, of, education, the, united, states, supreme, court, nullified, many, state, statutes, that, had, established, racially, segregated, schools, finding, such, statutes, to, be, incompatible, with, the, fourteenth, amendment, to, the, united, states, constitution, a, judiciary, is, theoretically, bound, by, the, constitution, just, as, all, other, government, bodies, are, in, most, countries, judges, may, only, interpret, the, constitution, and, all, other, laws, but, in, common, law, countries, where, matters, are, not, constitutional, the, judiciary, may, also, create, law, under, the, doctrine, of, precedent, the, uk, finland, and, new, zealand, assert, the, ideal, of, parliamentary, sovereignty, whereby, the, unelected, judiciary, may, not, overturn, law, passed, by, a, democratic, legislature, in, communist, states, such, as, china, the, courts, are, often, regarded, as, parts, of, the, executive, or, subservient, to, the, legislature, governmental, institutions, and, actors, exert, thus, various, forms, of, influence, on, the, judiciary, in, muslim, countries, courts, often, examine, whether, state, laws, adhere, to, the, sharia, the, supreme, constitutional, court, of, egypt, may, invalidate, such, laws, and, in, iran, the, guardian, council, ensures, the, compatibility, of, the, legislation, with, the, criteria, of, islam, prominent, examples, of, legislatures, are, the, houses, of, parliament, in, london, the, congress, in, washington, d, c, the, bundestag, in, berlin, the, duma, in, moscow, the, parlamento, italiano, in, rome, and, the, assembl, e, nationale, in, paris, by, the, principle, of, representative, government, people, vote, for, politicians, to, carry, out, their, wishes, although, countries, like, israel, greece, sweden, and, china, are, unicameral, most, countries, are, bicameral, meaning, they, have, two, separately, appointed, legislative, houses, in, the, lower, house, politicians, are, elected, to, represent, smaller, constituencies, the, upper, house, is, usually, elected, to, represent, states, in, a, federal, system, as, in, australia, germany, or, the, united, states, or, different, voting, configuration, in, a, unitary, system, as, in, france, in, the, uk, the, upper, house, is, appointed, by, the, government, as, a, house, of, review, one, criticism, of, bicameral, systems, with, two, elected, chambers, is, that, the, upper, and, lower, houses, may, simply, mirror, one, another, the, traditional, justification, of, bicameralism, is, that, an, upper, chamber, acts, as, a, house, of, review, this, can, minimise, arbitrariness, and, injustice, in, governmental, action, to, pass, legislation, a, majority, of, the, members, of, a, legislature, must, vote, for, a, bill, proposed, law, in, each, house, normally, there, will, be, several, readings, and, amendments, proposed, by, the, different, political, factions, if, a, country, has, an, entrenched, constitution, a, special, majority, for, changes, to, the, constitution, may, be, required, making, changes, to, the, law, more, difficult, a, government, usually, leads, the, process, which, can, be, formed, from, members, of, parliament, e, g, the, uk, or, germany, however, in, a, presidential, system, the, government, is, usually, formed, by, an, executive, and, his, or, her, appointed, cabinet, officials, e, g, the, united, states, or, brazil, the, executive, in, a, legal, system, serves, as, the, centre, of, political, authority, of, the, state, in, a, parliamentary, system, as, with, britain, italy, germany, india, and, japan, the, executive, is, known, as, the, cabinet, and, composed, of, members, of, the, legislature, the, executive, is, led, by, the, head, of, government, whose, office, holds, power, under, the, confidence, of, the, legislature, because, popular, elections, appoint, political, parties, to, govern, the, leader, of, a, party, can, change, in, between, elections, the, head, of, state, is, apart, from, the, executive, and, symbolically, enacts, laws, and, acts, as, representative, of, the, nation, examples, include, the, president, of, germany, appointed, by, members, of, federal, and, state, legislatures, the, queen, of, the, united, kingdom, an, hereditary, office, and, the, president, of, austria, elected, by, popular, vote, the, other, important, model, is, the, presidential, system, found, in, the, united, states, and, in, brazil, in, presidential, systems, the, executive, acts, as, both, head, of, state, and, head, of, government, and, has, power, to, appoint, an, unelected, cabinet, under, a, presidential, system, the, executive, branch, is, separate, from, the, legislature, to, which, it, is, not, accountable, although, the, role, of, the, executive, varies, from, country, to, country, usually, it, will, propose, the, majority, of, legislation, and, propose, government, agenda, in, presidential, systems, the, executive, often, has, the, power, to, veto, legislation, most, executives, in, both, systems, are, responsible, for, foreign, relations, the, military, and, police, and, the, bureaucracy, ministers, or, other, officials, head, a, country, s, public, offices, such, as, a, foreign, ministry, or, defence, ministry, the, election, of, a, different, executive, is, therefore, capable, of, revolutionising, an, entire, country, s, approach, to, government, while, military, organisations, have, existed, as, long, as, government, itself, the, idea, of, a, standing, police, force, is, a, relatively, modern, concept, for, example, medieval, england, s, system, of, travelling, criminal, courts, or, assizes, used, show, trials, and, public, executions, to, instill, communities, with, fear, to, maintain, control, the, first, modern, police, were, probably, those, in, 17th, century, paris, in, the, court, of, louis, xiv, although, the, paris, prefecture, of, police, claim, they, were, the, world, s, first, uniformed, policemen, max, weber, famously, argued, that, the, state, is, that, which, controls, the, monopoly, on, the, legitimate, use, of, force, the, military, and, police, carry, out, enforcement, at, the, request, of, the, government, or, the, courts, the, term, failed, state, refers, to, states, that, cannot, implement, or, enforce, policies, their, police, and, military, no, longer, control, security, and, order, and, society, moves, into, anarchy, the, absence, of, government, the, etymology, of, bureaucracy, derives, from, the, french, word, for, office, bureau, and, the, ancient, greek, for, word, power, kratos, like, the, military, and, police, a, legal, system, s, government, servants, and, bodies, that, make, up, its, bureaucracy, carry, out, the, directives, of, the, executive, one, of, the, earliest, references, to, the, concept, was, made, by, baron, de, grimm, a, german, author, who, lived, in, france, in, 1765, he, wrote, the, real, spirit, of, the, laws, in, france, is, that, bureaucracy, of, which, the, late, monsieur, de, gournay, used, to, complain, so, greatly, here, the, offices, clerks, secretaries, inspectors, and, intendants, are, not, appointed, to, benefit, the, public, interest, indeed, the, public, interest, appears, to, have, been, established, so, that, offices, might, exist, cynicism, over, officialdom, is, still, common, and, the, workings, of, public, servants, is, typically, contrasted, to, private, enterprise, motivated, by, profit, in, fact, private, companies, especially, large, ones, also, have, bureaucracies, negative, perceptions, of, red, tape, aside, public, services, such, as, schooling, health, care, policing, or, public, transport, are, considered, a, crucial, state, function, making, public, bureaucratic, action, the, locus, of, government, power, writing, in, the, early, 20th, century, max, weber, believed, that, a, definitive, feature, of, a, developed, state, had, come, to, be, its, bureaucratic, support, weber, wrote, that, the, typical, characteristics, of, modern, bureaucracy, are, that, officials, define, its, mission, the, scope, of, work, is, bound, by, rules, and, management, is, composed, of, career, experts, who, manage, top, down, communicating, through, writing, and, binding, public, servants, discretion, with, rules, a, corollary, of, the, rule, of, law, is, the, existence, of, a, legal, profession, sufficiently, autonomous, to, invoke, the, authority, of, the, independent, judiciary, the, right, to, assistance, of, a, barrister, in, a, court, proceeding, emanates, from, this, corollary, in, england, the, function, of, barrister, or, advocate, is, distinguished, from, legal, counselor, as, the, european, court, of, human, rights, has, stated, the, law, should, be, adequately, accessible, to, everyone, and, people, should, be, able, to, foresee, how, the, law, affects, them, in, order, to, maintain, professionalism, the, practice, of, law, is, typically, overseen, by, either, a, government, or, independent, regulating, body, such, as, a, bar, association, bar, council, or, law, society, modern, lawyers, achieve, distinct, professional, identity, through, specified, legal, procedures, e, g, successfully, passing, a, qualifying, examination, are, required, by, law, to, have, a, special, qualification, a, legal, education, earning, the, student, a, bachelor, of, laws, a, bachelor, of, civil, law, or, a, juris, doctor, degree, higher, academic, degrees, may, also, be, pursued, examples, include, a, master, of, laws, a, master, of, legal, studies, a, bar, professional, training, course, or, a, doctor, of, laws, and, are, constituted, in, office, by, legal, forms, of, appointment, being, admitted, to, the, bar, there, are, few, titles, of, respect, to, signify, famous, lawyers, such, as, esquire, to, indicate, barristers, of, greater, dignity, and, doctor, of, law, to, indicate, a, person, who, obtained, a, phd, in, law, many, muslim, countries, have, developed, similar, rules, about, legal, education, and, the, legal, profession, but, some, still, allow, lawyers, with, training, in, traditional, islamic, law, to, practice, law, before, personal, status, law, courts, in, china, and, other, developing, countries, there, are, not, sufficient, professionally, trained, people, to, staff, the, existing, judicial, systems, and, accordingly, formal, standards, are, more, relaxed, once, accredited, a, lawyer, will, often, work, in, a, law, firm, in, a, chambers, as, a, sole, practitioner, in, a, government, post, or, in, a, private, corporation, as, an, internal, counsel, in, addition, a, lawyer, may, become, a, legal, researcher, who, provides, on, demand, legal, research, through, a, library, a, commercial, service, or, freelance, work, many, people, trained, in, law, put, their, skills, to, use, outside, the, legal, field, entirely, significant, to, the, practice, of, law, in, the, common, law, tradition, is, the, legal, research, to, determine, the, current, state, of, the, law, this, usually, entails, exploring, case, law, reports, legal, periodicals, and, legislation, law, practice, also, involves, drafting, documents, such, as, court, pleadings, persuasive, briefs, contracts, or, wills, and, trusts, negotiation, and, dispute, resolution, skills, including, adr, techniques, are, also, important, to, legal, practice, depending, on, the, field, the, classical, republican, concept, of, civil, society, dates, back, to, hobbes, and, locke, locke, saw, civil, society, as, people, who, have, a, common, established, law, and, judicature, to, appeal, to, with, authority, to, decide, controversies, between, them, german, philosopher, georg, wilhelm, friedrich, hegel, distinguished, the, state, from, civil, society, german, b, rgerliche, gesellschaft, in, elements, of, the, philosophy, of, right, hegel, believed, that, civil, society, and, the, state, were, polar, opposites, within, the, scheme, of, his, dialectic, theory, of, history, the, modern, dipole, state, civil, society, was, reproduced, in, the, theories, of, alexis, de, tocqueville, and, karl, marx, in, post, modern, theory, civil, society, is, necessarily, a, source, of, law, by, being, the, basis, from, which, people, form, opinions, and, lobby, for, what, they, believe, law, should, be, as, australian, barrister, and, author, geoffrey, robertson, qc, wrote, of, international, law, one, of, its, primary, modern, sources, is, found, in, the, responses, of, ordinary, men, and, women, and, of, the, non, governmental, organizations, which, many, of, them, support, to, the, human, rights, abuses, they, see, on, the, television, screen, in, their, living, rooms, freedom, of, speech, freedom, of, association, and, many, other, individual, rights, allow, people, to, gather, discuss, criticise, and, hold, to, account, their, governments, from, which, the, basis, of, a, deliberative, democracy, is, formed, the, more, people, are, involved, with, concerned, by, and, capable, of, changing, how, political, power, is, exercised, over, their, lives, the, more, acceptable, and, legitimate, the, law, becomes, to, the, people, the, most, familiar, institutions, of, civil, society, include, economic, markets, profit, oriented, firms, families, trade, unions, hospitals, universities, schools, charities, debating, clubs, non, governmental, organisations, neighbourhoods, churches, and, religious, associations, there, is, no, clear, legal, definition, of, the, civil, society, and, of, the, institutions, it, includes, most, of, the, institutions, and, bodies, who, try, to, give, a, list, of, institutions, such, as, the, european, economic, and, social, committee, exclude, the, political, parties, all, legal, systems, deal, with, the, same, basic, issues, but, jurisdictions, categorise, and, identify, their, legal, topics, in, different, ways, a, common, distinction, is, that, between, public, law, a, term, related, closely, to, the, state, and, including, constitutional, administrative, and, criminal, law, and, private, law, which, covers, contract, tort, and, property, in, civil, law, systems, contract, and, tort, fall, under, a, general, law, of, obligations, while, trusts, law, is, dealt, with, under, statutory, regimes, or, international, conventions, international, constitutional, and, administrative, law, criminal, law, contract, tort, property, law, and, trusts, are, regarded, as, the, traditional, core, subjects, although, there, are, many, further, disciplines, international, law, can, refer, to, three, things, public, international, law, private, international, law, or, conflict, of, laws, and, the, law, of, supranational, organisations, constitutional, and, administrative, law, govern, the, affairs, of, the, state, constitutional, law, concerns, both, the, relationships, between, the, executive, legislature, and, judiciary, and, the, human, rights, or, civil, liberties, of, individuals, against, the, state, most, jurisdictions, like, the, united, states, and, france, have, a, single, codified, constitution, with, a, bill, of, rights, a, few, like, the, united, kingdom, have, no, such, document, a, constitution, is, simply, those, laws, which, constitute, the, body, politic, from, statute, case, law, and, convention, the, fundamental, constitutional, principle, inspired, by, john, locke, holds, that, the, individual, can, do, anything, except, that, which, is, forbidden, by, law, and, the, state, may, do, nothing, except, that, which, is, authorised, by, law, administrative, law, is, the, chief, method, for, people, to, hold, state, bodies, to, account, people, wheresoever, allowed, may, potentially, have, prerogative, to, legally, challenge, or, sue, an, agency, local, council, public, service, or, government, ministry, for, judicial, review, of, the, offending, edict, law,

electoral, fraud, and, electoral, silence, criminal, law, also, known, as, penal, law, pertains, to, crimes, and, punishment, it, thus, regulates, the, definition, of, and, penalties, for, offences, found, to, have, a, sufficiently, deleterious, social, impact, but, in, itself, makes, no, moral, judgment, on, an, offender, nor, imposes, restrictions, on, society, that, physically, prevent, people, from, committing, a, crime, in, the, first, place, investigating, apprehending, charging, and, trying, suspected, offenders, is, regulated, by, the, law, of, criminal, procedure, the, paradigm, case, of, a, crime, lies, in, the, proof, beyond, reasonable, doubt, that, a, person, is, guilty, of, two, things, first, the, accused, must, commit, an, act, which, is, deemed, by, society, to, be, criminal, or, actus, reus, guilty, act, second, the, accused, must, have, the, requisite, malicious, intent, to, do, a, criminal, act, or, mens, rea, guilty, mind, however, for, so, called, strict, liability, crimes, an, actus, reus, is, enough, criminal, systems, of, the, civil, law, tradition, distinguish, between, intention, in, the, broad, sense, dolus, directus, and, dolus, eventualis, and, negligence, negligence, does, not, carry, criminal, responsibility, unless, a, particular, crime, provides, for, its, punishment, examples, of, crimes, include, murder, assault, fraud, and, theft, in, exceptional, circumstances, defences, can, apply, to, specific, acts, such, as, killing, in, self, defence, or, pleading, insanity, another, example, is, in, the, 19th, century, english, case, of, r, v, dudley, and, stephens, which, tested, a, defence, of, necessity, criminal, law, offences, are, viewed, as, offences, against, not, just, individual, victims, but, the, community, as, well, the, state, usually, with, the, help, of, police, takes, the, lead, in, prosecution, which, is, why, in, common, law, countries, cases, are, cited, as, the, people, v, or, r, for, rex, or, regina, v, also, lay, juries, are, often, used, to, determine, the, guilt, of, defendants, on, points, of, fact, juries, cannot, change, legal, rules, some, developed, countries, still, condone, capital, punishment, for, criminal, activity, but, the, normal, punishment, for, a, crime, will, be, imprisonment, fines, state, supervision, such, as, probation, or, community, service, modern, criminal, law, has, been, affected, considerably, by, the, social, sciences, especially, with, respect, to, sentencing, legal, research, legislation, and, rehabilitation, on, the, international, field, 111, countries, are, members, of, the, international, criminal, court, which, was, established, to, try, people, for, crimes, against, humanity, contract, law, concerns, enforceable, promises, and, can, be, summed, up, in, the, latin, phrase, pacta, sunt, servanda, agreements, must, be, kept, in, common, law, jurisdictions, three, key, elements, to, the, creation, of, a, contract, are, necessary, offer, and, acceptance, consideration, and, the, intention, to, create, legal, relations, consideration, indicates, the, fact, that, all, parties, to, a, contract, have, exchanged, something, of, value, some, common, law, systems, including, australia, are, moving, away, from, the, idea, of, consideration, as, a, requirement, the, idea, of, estoppel, or, culpa, in, contrahendo, can, be, used, to, create, obligations, during, pre, contractual, negotiations, civil, law, jurisdictions, treat, contracts, differently, in, a, number, of, respects, with, a, more, interventionist, role, for, the, state, in, both, the, formation, and, enforcement, of, contracts, compared, to, common, law, jurisdictions, civil, law, systems, incorporate, more, mandatory, terms, into, contracts, allow, greater, latitude, for, courts, to, interpret, and, revise, contract, terms, and, impose, a, stronger, duty, of, good, faith, but, are, also, more, likely, to, enforce, penalty, clauses, and, specific, performance, of, contracts, they, also, do, not, require, consideration, for, a, contract, to, be, binding, in, france, an, ordinary, contract, is, said, to, form, simply, on, the, basis, of, a, meeting, of, the, minds, or, a, concurrence, of, wills, germany, has, a, special, approach, to, contracts, which, ties, into, property, law, their, abstraction, principle, abstraktionsprinzip, means, that, the, personal, obligation, of, contract, forms, separately, from, the, title, of, property, being, conferred, when, contracts, are, invalidated, for, some, reason, e, g, a, car, buyer, is, so, drunk, that, he, lacks, legal, capacity, to, contract, the, contractual, obligation, to, pay, can, be, invalidated, separately, from, the, proprietary, title, of, the, car, unjust, enrichment, law, rather, than, contract, law, is, then, used, to, restore, title, to, the, rightful, owner, certain, civil, wrongs, are, grouped, together, as, torts, under, common, law, systems, and, delicts, under, civil, law, systems, to, have, acted, tortiously, one, must, have, breached, a, duty, to, another, person, or, infringed, some, pre, existing, legal, right, a, simple, example, might, be, unintentionally, hitting, someone, with, a, ball, under, the, law, of, negligence, the, most, common, form, of, tort, the, injured, party, could, potentially, claim, compensation, for, their, injuries, from, the, party, responsible, the, principles, of, negligence, are, illustrated, by, donoghue, v, stevenson, a, friend, of, donoghue, ordered, an, opaque, bottle, of, ginger, beer, intended, for, the, consumption, of, donoghue, in, a, caf, in, paisley, having, consumed, half, of, it, donoghue, poured, the, remainder, into, a, tumbler, the, decomposing, remains, of, a, snail, floated, out, she, claimed, to, have, suffered, from, shock, fell, ill, with, gastroenteritis, and, sued, the, manufacturer, for, carelessly, allowing, the, drink, to, be, contaminated, the, house, of, lords, decided, that, the, manufacturer, was, liable, for, mrs, donoghue, s, illness, lord, atkin, took, a, distinctly, moral, approach, and, said, the, liability, for, negligence, is, no, doubt, based, upon, a, general, public, sentiment, of, moral, wrongdoing, for, which, the, offender, must, pay, the, rule, that, you, are, to, love, your, neighbour, becomes, in, law, you, must, not, injure, your, neighbour, and, the, lawyer, s, question, who, is, my, neighbour, receives, a, restricted, reply, you, must, take, reasonable, care, to, avoid, acts, or, omissions, which, you, can, reasonably, foresee, would, be, likely, to, injure, your, neighbour, this, became, the, basis, for, the, four, principles, of, negligence, namely, that, another, example, of, tort, might, be, a, neighbour, making, excessively, loud, noises, with, machinery, on, his, property, under, a, nuisance, claim, the, noise, could, be, stopped, torts, can, also, involve, intentional, acts, such, as, assault, battery, or, trespass, a, better, known, tort, is, defamation, which, occurs, for, example, when, a, newspaper, makes, unsupportable, allegations, that, damage, a, politician, s, reputation, more, infamous, are, economic, torts, which, form, the, basis, of, labour, law, in, some, countries, by, making, trade, unions, liable, for, strikes, when, statute, does, not, provide, immunity, property, law, governs, ownership, and, possession, real, property, sometimes, called, real, estate, refers, to, ownership, of, land, and, things, attached, to, it, personal, property, refers, to, everything, else, movable, objects, such, as, computers, cars, jewelry, or, intangible, rights, such, as, stocks, and, shares, a, right, in, rem, is, a, right, to, a, specific, piece, of, property, contrasting, to, a, right, in, personam, which, allows, compensation, for, a, loss, but, not, a, particular, thing, back, land, law, forms, the, basis, for, most, kinds, of, property, law, and, is, the, most, complex, it, concerns, mortgages, rental, agreements, licences, covenants, easements, and, the, statutory, systems, for, land, registration, regulations, on, the, use, of, personal, property, fall, under, intellectual, property, company, law, trusts, and, commercial, law, an, example, of, a, basic, case, of, most, property, law, is, armory, v, delamirie, a, chimney, sweep, s, boy, found, a, jewel, encrusted, with, precious, stones, he, took, it, to, a, goldsmith, to, have, it, valued, the, goldsmith, s, apprentice, looked, at, it, sneakily, removed, the, stones, told, the, boy, it, was, worth, three, halfpence, and, that, he, would, buy, it, the, boy, said, he, would, prefer, the, jewel, back, so, the, apprentice, gave, it, to, him, but, without, the, stones, the, boy, sued, the, goldsmith, for, his, apprentice, s, attempt, to, cheat, him, lord, chief, justice, pratt, ruled, that, even, though, the, boy, could, not, be, said, to, own, the, jewel, he, should, be, considered, the, rightful, keeper, finders, keepers, until, the, original, owner, is, found, in, fact, the, apprentice, and, the, boy, both, had, a, right, of, possession, in, the, jewel, a, technical, concept, meaning, evidence, that, something, could, belong, to, someone, but, the, boy, s, possessory, interest, was, considered, better, because, it, could, be, shown, to, be, first, in, time, possession, may, be, nine, tenths, of, the, law, but, not, all, this, case, is, used, to, support, the, view, of, property, in, common, law, jurisdictions, that, the, person, who, can, show, the, best, claim, to, a, piece, of, property, against, any, contesting, party, is, the, owner, by, contrast, the, classic, civil, law, approach, to, property, propounded, by, friedrich, carl, von, savigny, is, that, it, is, a, right, good, against, the, world, obligations, like, contracts, and, torts, are, conceptualised, as, rights, good, between, individuals, the, idea, of, property, raises, many, further, philosophical, and, political, issues, locke, argued, that, our, lives, liberties, and, estates, are, our, property, because, we, own, our, bodies, and, mix, our, labour, with, our, surroundings, equity, is, a, body, of, rules, that, developed, in, england, separately, from, the, common, law, the, common, law, was, administered, by, judges, and, barristers, the, lord, chancellor, on, the, other, hand, as, the, king, s, keeper, of, conscience, could, overrule, the, judge, made, law, if, he, thought, it, equitable, to, do, so, this, meant, equity, came, to, operate, more, through, principles, than, rigid, rules, whereas, neither, the, common, law, nor, civil, law, systems, allow, people, to, split, the, ownership, from, the, control, of, one, piece, of, property, equity, allows, this, through, an, arrangement, known, as, a, trust, trustees, control, property, whereas, the, beneficial, or, equitable, ownership, of, trust, property, is, held, by, people, known, as, beneficiaries, trustees, owe, duties, to, their, beneficiaries, to, take, good, care, of, the, entrusted, property, another, example, of, a, trustee, s, duty, might, be, to, invest, property, wisely, or, sell, it, this, is, especially, the, case, for, pension, funds, the, most, important, form, of, trust, where, investors, are, trustees, for, people, s, savings, until, retirement, but, trusts, can, also, be, set, up, for, charitable, purposes, in, the, 18th, century, adam, smith, presented, a, philosophical, foundation, for, explaining, the, relationship, between, law, and, economics, the, discipline, arose, partly, out, of, a, critique, of, trade, unions, and, u, s, antitrust, law, the, most, influential, proponents, such, as, richard, posner, and, oliver, williamson, and, the, so, called, chicago, school, of, economists, and, lawyers, including, milton, friedman, and, gary, becker, are, generally, advocates, of, deregulation, and, privatisation, and, are, hostile, to, state, regulation, or, what, they, see, as, restrictions, on, the, operation, of, free, markets, the, most, prominent, economic, analyst, of, law, is, 1991, nobel, prize, winner, ronald, coase, whose, first, major, article, the, nature, of, the, firm, 1937, argued, that, the, reason, for, the, existence, of, firms, companies, partnerships, etc, is, the, existence, of, transaction, costs, rational, individuals, trade, through, bilateral, contracts, on, open, markets, until, the, costs, of, transactions, mean, that, using, corporations, to, produce, things, is, more, cost, effective, his, second, major, article, the, problem, of, social, cost, 1960, argued, that, if, we, lived, in, a, world, without, transaction, costs, people, would, bargain, with, one, another, to, create, the, same, allocation, of, resources, regardless, of, the, way, a, court, might, rule, in, property, disputes, coase, used, the, example, of, a, nuisance, case, named, sturges, v, bridgman, where, a, noisy, sweetmaker, and, a, quiet, doctor, were, neighbours, and, went, to, court, to, see, who, should, have, to, move, coase, said, that, regardless, of, whether, the, judge, ruled, that, the, sweetmaker, had, to, stop, using, his, machinery, or, that, the, doctor, had, to, put, up, with, it, they, could, strike, a, mutually, beneficial, bargain, about, who, moves, that, reaches, the, same, outcome, of, resource, distribution, only, the, existence, of, transaction, costs, may, prevent, this, so, the, law, ought, to, pre, empt, what, would, happen, and, be, guided, by, the, most, efficient, solution, the, idea, is, that, law, and, regulation, are, not, as, important, or, effective, at, helping, people, as, lawyers, and, government, planners, believe, coase, and, others, like, him, wanted, a, change, of, approach, to, put, the, burden, of, proof, for, positive, effects, on, a, government, that, was, intervening, in, the, market, by, analysing, the, costs, of, action, the, sociology, of, law, examines, the, interaction, of, law, with, society, and, overlaps, with, jurisprudence, philosophy, of, law, social, theory, and, more, specialised, subjects, such, as, criminology, it, is, a, transdisciplinary, and, multidisciplinary, study, focused, on, the, theorisation, and, empirical, study, of, legal, practices, and, experiences, as, social, phenomena, the, institutions, of, social, construction, social, norms, dispute, processing, and, legal, culture, are, key, areas, for, inquiry, in, this, knowledge, field, in, the, united, states, the, field, is, usually, called, law, and, society, studies, in, europe, it, is, more, often, referred, to, as, socio, legal, studies, at, first, jurists, and, legal, philosophers, were, suspicious, of, sociology, of, law, kelsen, attacked, one, of, its, founders, eugen, ehrlich, who, sought, to, make, clear, the, differences, and, connections, between, positive, law, which, lawyers, learn, and, apply, and, other, forms, of, law, or, social, norms, that, regulate, everyday, life, generally, preventing, conflicts, from, reaching, lawyers, and, courts, contemporary, research, in, the, sociology, of, law, is, concerned, with, the, way, that, law, develops, outside, discrete, state, jurisdictions, being, produced, through, social, interaction, in, social, arenas, and, acquiring, a, diversity, of, sources, of, authority, in, national, and, transnational, communal, networks, around, 1900, max, weber, defined, his, scientific, approach, to, law, identifying, the, legal, rational, form, as, a, type, of, domination, not, attributable, to, personal, authority, but, to, the, authority, of, abstract, norms, formal, legal, rationality, was, his, term, for, the, key, characteristic, of, the, kind, of, coherent, and, calculable, law, that, was, a, precondition, for, modern, political, developments, and, the, modern, bureaucratic, state, weber, saw, this, law, as, having, developed, in, parallel, with, the, growth, of, capitalism, another, leading, sociologist, mile, durkheim, wrote, in, his, classic, work, the, division, of, labour, in, society, that, as, society, becomes, more, complex, the, body, of, civil, law, concerned, primarily, with, restitution, and, compensation, grows, at, the, expense, of, criminal, laws, and, penal, sanctions, other, notable, early, legal, sociologists, included, hugo, sinzheimer, theodor, geiger, georges, gurvitch, and, leon, petra, ycki, in, europe, and, william, graham, sumner, in, the, u, s
