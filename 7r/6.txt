a, meme, m, i, m, meem, is, an, idea, behavior, or, style, that, spreads, by, means, of, imitation, from, person, to, person, within, a, culture, and, often, carries, symbolic, meaning, representing, a, particular, phenomenon, or, theme, a, meme, acts, as, a, unit, for, carrying, cultural, ideas, symbols, or, practices, that, can, be, transmitted, from, one, mind, to, another, through, writing, speech, gestures, rituals, or, other, imitable, phenomena, with, a, mimicked, theme, supporters, of, the, concept, regard, memes, as, cultural, analogues, to, genes, in, that, they, self, replicate, mutate, and, respond, to, selective, pressures, in, popular, language, a, meme, may, refer, to, an, internet, meme, typically, an, image, that, is, remixed, copied, and, circulated, in, a, shared, cultural, experience, online, proponents, theorize, that, memes, are, a, viral, phenomenon, that, may, evolve, by, natural, selection, in, a, manner, analogous, to, that, of, biological, evolution, memes, do, this, through, processes, analogous, to, those, of, variation, mutation, competition, and, inheritance, each, of, which, influences, a, meme, s, reproductive, success, memes, spread, through, the, behavior, that, they, generate, in, their, hosts, memes, that, propagate, less, prolifically, may, become, extinct, while, others, may, survive, spread, and, for, better, or, for, worse, mutate, memes, that, replicate, most, effectively, enjoy, more, success, and, some, may, replicate, effectively, even, when, they, prove, to, be, detrimental, to, the, welfare, of, their, hosts, a, field, of, study, called, memetics, arose, in, the, 1990s, to, explore, the, concepts, and, transmission, of, memes, in, terms, of, an, evolutionary, model, criticism, from, a, variety, of, fronts, has, challenged, the, notion, that, academic, study, can, examine, memes, empirically, however, developments, in, neuroimaging, may, make, empirical, study, possible, some, commentators, in, the, social, sciences, question, the, idea, that, one, can, meaningfully, categorize, culture, in, terms, of, discrete, units, and, are, especially, critical, of, the, biological, nature, of, the, theory, s, underpinnings, others, have, argued, that, this, use, of, the, term, is, the, result, of, a, misunderstanding, of, the, original, proposal, the, word, meme, itself, is, a, neologism, coined, by, richard, dawkins, originating, from, his, 1976, book, the, selfish, gene, dawkins, s, own, position, is, somewhat, ambiguous, he, welcomed, n, k, humphrey, s, suggestion, that, memes, should, be, considered, as, living, structures, not, just, metaphorically, and, proposed, to, regard, memes, as, physically, residing, in, the, brain, although, dawkins, said, his, original, intentions, had, been, simpler, he, approved, humphrey, s, opinion, and, he, endorsed, susan, blackmore, s, 1999, project, to, give, a, scientific, theory, of, memes, complete, with, predictions, and, empirical, support, the, term, meme, is, a, shortening, modeled, on, gene, of, mimeme, which, comes, from, ancient, greek, m, m, ma, pronounced, meaning, imitated, thing, itself, from, mimeisthai, to, imitate, from, mimos, mime, the, word, was, coined, by, british, evolutionary, biologist, richard, dawkins, in, the, selfish, gene, 1976, as, a, concept, for, discussion, of, evolutionary, principles, in, explaining, the, spread, of, ideas, and, cultural, phenomena, examples, of, memes, given, in, dawkins, book, include, melodies, catchphrases, fashion, and, the, technology, of, building, arches, although, richard, dawkins, invented, the, term, meme, and, developed, meme, theory, he, has, not, claimed, that, the, idea, was, entirely, novel, and, there, have, been, other, expressions, for, similar, ideas, in, the, past, for, instance, the, possibility, that, ideas, were, subject, to, the, same, pressures, of, evolution, as, were, biological, attributes, was, discussed, in, the, time, of, charles, darwin, t, h, huxley, 1880, claimed, that, the, struggle, for, existence, holds, as, much, in, the, intellectual, as, in, the, physical, world, a, theory, is, a, species, of, thinking, and, its, right, to, exist, is, coextensive, with, its, power, of, resisting, extinction, by, its, rivals, in, 1904, richard, semon, published, die, mneme, which, appeared, in, english, in, 1924, as, the, mneme, the, term, mneme, was, also, used, in, maurice, maeterlinck, s, the, life, of, the, white, ant, 1926, with, some, parallels, to, dawkins, s, concept, kenneth, pike, had, in, 1954, coined, the, related, terms, emic, and, etic, generalizing, the, linguistic, units, of, phoneme, morpheme, grapheme, lexeme, and, tagmeme, as, set, out, by, leonard, bloomfield, distinguishing, insider, and, outside, views, of, communicative, behavior, the, word, meme, originated, with, richard, dawkins, 1976, book, the, selfish, gene, dawkins, cites, as, inspiration, the, work, of, geneticist, l, l, cavalli, sforza, anthropologist, f, t, cloak, and, ethologist, j, m, cullen, dawkins, wrote, that, evolution, depended, not, on, the, particular, chemical, basis, of, genetics, but, only, on, the, existence, of, a, self, replicating, unit, of, transmission, in, the, case, of, biological, evolution, the, gene, for, dawkins, the, meme, exemplified, another, self, replicating, unit, with, potential, significance, in, explaining, human, behavior, and, cultural, evolution, dawkins, used, the, term, to, refer, to, any, cultural, entity, that, an, observer, might, consider, a, replicator, he, hypothesized, that, one, could, view, many, cultural, entities, as, replicators, and, pointed, to, melodies, fashions, and, learned, skills, as, examples, memes, generally, replicate, through, exposure, to, humans, who, have, evolved, as, efficient, copiers, of, information, and, behavior, because, humans, do, not, always, copy, memes, perfectly, and, because, they, may, refine, combine, or, otherwise, modify, them, with, other, memes, to, create, new, memes, they, can, change, over, time, dawkins, likened, the, process, by, which, memes, survive, and, change, through, the, evolution, of, culture, to, the, natural, selection, of, genes, in, biological, evolution, dawkins, noted, that, in, a, society, with, culture, a, person, need, not, have, biological, descendants, to, remain, influential, in, the, actions, of, individuals, thousands, of, years, after, their, death, but, if, you, contribute, to, the, world, s, culture, if, you, have, a, good, idea, it, may, live, on, intact, long, after, your, genes, have, dissolved, in, the, common, pool, socrates, may, or, may, not, have, a, gene, or, two, alive, in, the, world, today, as, g, c, williams, has, remarked, but, who, cares, the, meme, complexes, of, socrates, leonardo, copernicus, and, marconi, are, still, going, strong, in, that, context, dawkins, defined, the, meme, as, a, unit, of, cultural, transmission, or, a, unit, of, imitation, and, replication, but, later, definitions, would, vary, the, lack, of, a, consistent, rigorous, and, precise, understanding, of, what, typically, makes, up, one, unit, of, cultural, transmission, remains, a, problem, in, debates, about, memetics, in, contrast, the, concept, of, genetics, gained, concrete, evidence, with, the, discovery, of, the, biological, functions, of, dna, meme, transmission, requires, a, physical, medium, such, as, photons, sound, waves, touch, taste, or, smell, because, memes, can, be, transmitted, only, through, the, senses, initially, dawkins, did, not, seriously, give, context, to, the, material, of, memetics, he, considered, a, meme, to, be, an, idea, and, thus, a, mental, concept, however, from, dawkins, initial, conception, it, is, how, a, medium, might, function, in, relation, to, the, meme, which, has, garnered, the, most, attention, for, example, david, hull, suggested, that, while, memes, might, exist, as, dawkins, conceives, of, them, he, finds, it, important, to, suggest, that, instead, of, determining, them, as, idea, replicators, i, e, mind, determinant, influences, one, might, notice, that, the, medium, itself, has, an, influence, in, the, meme, s, evolutionary, outcomes, thus, he, refers, to, the, medium, as, an, interactor, to, avoid, this, determinism, alternatively, daniel, dennett, suggests, that, the, medium, and, the, idea, are, not, distinct, in, that, memes, only, exist, because, of, their, medium, dennett, argued, this, in, order, to, remain, consistent, with, his, denial, of, qualia, and, the, notion, of, materially, deterministic, evolution, which, was, consistent, with, dawkins, account, a, particularly, more, divergent, theory, is, that, of, limor, shifman, a, communication, and, media, scholar, of, internet, memetics, she, argues, that, any, memetic, argument, which, claims, the, distinction, between, the, meme, and, the, meme, vehicle, i, e, the, meme, s, medium, are, empirically, observable, is, mistaken, from, the, offset, shifman, claims, to, be, following, a, similar, theoretical, direction, as, susan, blackmore, however, her, attention, to, the, media, surrounding, internet, culture, has, enabled, internet, memetic, research, to, depart, in, empirical, interests, from, previous, memetic, goals, regardless, of, internet, memetic, s, divergence, in, theoretical, interests, it, plays, a, significant, role, in, theorizing, and, empirically, investigating, the, connection, between, cultural, ideologies, behaviors, and, their, mediation, processes, memes, analogously, to, genes, vary, in, their, aptitude, to, replicate, successful, memes, remain, and, spread, whereas, unfit, ones, stall, and, are, forgotten, thus, memes, that, prove, more, effective, at, replicating, and, surviving, are, selected, in, the, meme, pool, memes, first, need, retention, the, longer, a, meme, stays, in, its, hosts, the, higher, its, chances, of, propagation, are, when, a, host, uses, a, meme, the, meme, s, life, is, extended, the, reuse, of, the, neural, space, hosting, a, certain, meme, s, copy, to, host, different, memes, is, the, greatest, threat, to, that, meme, s, copy, a, meme, that, increases, the, longevity, of, its, hosts, will, generally, survive, longer, on, the, contrary, a, meme, that, shortens, the, longevity, of, its, hosts, will, tend, to, disappear, faster, however, as, hosts, are, mortal, retention, is, not, sufficient, to, perpetuate, a, meme, in, the, long, term, memes, also, need, transmission, life, forms, can, transmit, information, both, vertically, from, parent, to, child, via, replication, of, genes, and, horizontally, through, viruses, and, other, means, memes, can, replicate, vertically, or, horizontally, within, a, single, biological, generation, they, may, also, lie, dormant, for, long, periods, of, time, memes, reproduce, by, copying, from, a, nervous, system, to, another, one, either, by, communication, or, imitation, imitation, often, involves, the, copying, of, an, observed, behavior, of, another, individual, communication, may, be, direct, or, indirect, where, memes, transmit, from, one, individual, to, another, through, a, copy, recorded, in, an, inanimate, source, such, as, a, book, or, a, musical, score, adam, mcnamara, has, suggested, that, memes, can, be, thereby, classified, as, either, internal, or, external, memes, i, memes, or, e, memes, some, commentators, have, likened, the, transmission, of, memes, to, the, spread, of, contagions, social, contagions, such, as, fads, hysteria, copycat, crime, and, copycat, suicide, exemplify, memes, seen, as, the, contagious, imitation, of, ideas, observers, distinguish, the, contagious, imitation, of, memes, from, instinctively, contagious, phenomena, such, as, yawning, and, laughing, which, they, consider, innate, rather, than, socially, learned, behaviors, aaron, lynch, described, seven, general, patterns, of, meme, transmission, or, thought, contagion, dawkins, initially, defined, meme, as, a, noun, that, conveys, the, idea, of, a, unit, of, cultural, transmission, or, a, unit, of, imitation, john, s, wilkins, retained, the, notion, of, meme, as, a, kernel, of, cultural, imitation, while, emphasizing, the, meme, s, evolutionary, aspect, defining, the, meme, as, the, least, unit, of, sociocultural, information, relative, to, a, selection, process, that, has, favorable, or, unfavorable, selection, bias, that, exceeds, its, endogenous, tendency, to, change, the, meme, as, a, unit, provides, a, convenient, means, of, discussing, a, piece, of, thought, copied, from, person, to, person, regardless, of, whether, that, thought, contains, others, inside, it, or, forms, part, of, a, larger, meme, a, meme, could, consist, of, a, single, word, or, a, meme, could, consist, of, the, entire, speech, in, which, that, word, first, occurred, this, forms, an, analogy, to, the, idea, of, a, gene, as, a, single, unit, of, self, replicating, information, found, on, the, self, replicating, chromosome, while, the, identification, of, memes, as, units, conveys, their, nature, to, replicate, as, discrete, indivisible, entities, it, does, not, imply, that, thoughts, somehow, become, quantized, or, that, atomic, ideas, exist, that, cannot, be, dissected, into, smaller, pieces, a, meme, has, no, given, size, susan, blackmore, writes, that, melodies, from, beethoven, s, symphonies, are, commonly, used, to, illustrate, the, difficulty, involved, in, delimiting, memes, as, discrete, units, she, notes, that, while, the, first, four, notes, of, beethoven, s, fifth, symphony, listen, form, a, meme, widely, replicated, as, an, independent, unit, one, can, regard, the, entire, symphony, as, a, single, meme, as, well, the, inability, to, pin, an, idea, or, cultural, feature, to, quantifiable, key, units, is, widely, acknowledged, as, a, problem, for, memetics, it, has, been, argued, however, that, the, traces, of, memetic, processing, can, be, quantified, utilizing, neuroimaging, techniques, which, measure, changes, in, the, connectivity, profiles, between, brain, regions, blackmore, meets, such, criticism, by, stating, that, memes, compare, with, genes, in, this, respect, that, while, a, gene, has, no, particular, size, nor, can, we, ascribe, every, phenotypic, feature, directly, to, a, particular, gene, it, has, value, because, it, encapsulates, that, key, unit, of, inherited, expression, subject, to, evolutionary, pressures, to, illustrate, she, notes, evolution, selects, for, the, gene, for, features, such, as, eye, color, it, does, not, select, for, the, individual, nucleotide, in, a, strand, of, dna, memes, play, a, comparable, role, in, understanding, the, evolution, of, imitated, behaviors, genes, mind, and, culture, the, coevolutionary, process, 1981, by, charles, j, lumsden, and, e, o, wilson, proposes, the, theory, that, genes, and, culture, co, evolve, and, that, the, fundamental, biological, units, of, culture, must, correspond, to, neuronal, networks, that, function, as, nodes, of, semantic, memory, lumsden, and, wilson, coined, their, own, word, culturgen, which, did, not, catch, on, coauthor, wilson, later, acknowledged, the, term, meme, as, the, best, label, for, the, fundamental, unit, of, cultural, inheritance, in, his, 1998, book, consilience, the, unity, of, knowledge, which, elaborates, upon, the, fundamental, role, of, memes, in, unifying, the, natural, and, social, sciences, at, present, the, existence, of, discrete, cultural, units, which, satisfy, memetic, theory, has, been, challenged, in, a, variety, of, ways, what, is, critical, from, this, perspective, is, that, in, denying, memetics, unitary, status, is, to, deny, a, particularly, fundamental, part, of, dawkins, original, argument, in, particular, denying, memes, are, a, unit, or, are, explainable, in, some, clear, unitary, structure, denies, the, cultural, analogy, that, inspired, dawkins, to, define, them, if, memes, are, not, describable, as, unitary, memes, are, not, accountable, within, a, neo, darwinian, model, of, evolutionary, culture, within, cultural, anthropology, materialist, approaches, are, skeptical, of, such, units, in, particular, dan, sperber, argues, that, memes, are, not, unitary, in, the, sense, that, there, are, no, two, instances, of, exactly, the, same, cultural, idea, all, that, can, be, argued, is, that, there, is, material, mimicry, of, an, idea, thus, every, instance, of, a, meme, would, not, be, a, true, evolutionary, unit, of, replication, dan, deacon, kalevi, kull, separately, argued, memes, are, degenerate, signs, in, that, they, offer, only, a, partial, explanation, of, the, triadic, in, charles, sanders, peirce, s, semiotic, theory, a, sign, a, reference, to, an, object, an, object, the, thing, being, referred, to, and, an, interpretant, the, interpreting, actor, of, a, sign, they, argue, the, meme, unit, is, a, sign, which, only, is, defined, by, its, replication, ability, accordingly, in, the, broadest, sense, the, objects, of, copying, are, memes, whereas, the, objects, of, translation, and, interpretation, are, signs, later, sara, cannizzaro, more, fully, develops, out, this, semiotic, relation, in, order, to, reframe, memes, as, being, a, kind, of, semiotic, activity, however, she, too, denies, that, memes, are, units, referring, to, them, as, sign, systems, instead, in, limor, shifman, s, account, of, internet, memetics, she, also, denies, memetics, as, being, unitary, she, argues, memes, are, not, unitary, however, many, assume, they, are, because, many, previous, memetic, researchers, confounded, memes, with, the, cultural, interest, in, virals, singular, informational, objects, which, spread, with, a, particular, rate, and, veracity, such, as, a, video, or, a, picture, as, such, shifman, argues, that, dawkins, original, notion, of, meme, is, closer, to, what, communication, and, information, studies, consider, digitally, viral, replication, dawkins, noted, the, three, conditions, that, must, exist, for, evolution, to, occur, dawkins, emphasizes, that, the, process, of, evolution, naturally, occurs, whenever, these, conditions, co, exist, and, that, evolution, does, not, apply, only, to, organic, elements, such, as, genes, he, regards, memes, as, also, having, the, properties, necessary, for, evolution, and, thus, sees, meme, evolution, as, not, simply, analogous, to, genetic, evolution, but, as, a, real, phenomenon, subject, to, the, laws, of, natural, selection, dawkins, noted, that, as, various, ideas, pass, from, one, generation, to, the, next, they, may, either, enhance, or, detract, from, the, survival, of, the, people, who, obtain, those, ideas, or, influence, the, survival, of, the, ideas, themselves, for, example, a, certain, culture, may, develop, unique, designs, and, methods, of, tool, making, that, give, it, a, competitive, advantage, over, another, culture, each, tool, design, thus, acts, somewhat, similarly, to, a, biological, gene, in, that, some, populations, have, it, and, others, do, not, and, the, meme, s, function, directly, affects, the, presence, of, the, design, in, future, generations, in, keeping, with, the, thesis, that, in, evolution, one, can, regard, organisms, simply, as, suitable, hosts, for, reproducing, genes, dawkins, argues, that, one, can, view, people, as, hosts, for, replicating, memes, consequently, a, successful, meme, may, or, may, not, need, to, provide, any, benefit, to, its, host, unlike, genetic, evolution, memetic, evolution, can, show, both, darwinian, and, lamarckian, traits, cultural, memes, will, have, the, characteristic, of, lamarckian, inheritance, when, a, host, aspires, to, replicate, the, given, meme, through, inference, rather, than, by, exactly, copying, it, take, for, example, the, case, of, the, transmission, of, a, simple, skill, such, as, hammering, a, nail, a, skill, that, a, learner, imitates, from, watching, a, demonstration, without, necessarily, imitating, every, discrete, movement, modeled, by, the, teacher, in, the, demonstration, stroke, for, stroke, susan, blackmore, distinguishes, the, difference, between, the, two, modes, of, inheritance, in, the, evolution, of, memes, characterizing, the, darwinian, mode, as, copying, the, instructions, and, the, lamarckian, as, copying, the, product, clusters, of, memes, or, memeplexes, also, known, as, meme, complexes, or, as, memecomplexes, such, as, cultural, or, political, doctrines, and, systems, may, also, play, a, part, in, the, acceptance, of, new, memes, memeplexes, comprise, groups, of, memes, that, replicate, together, and, coadapt, memes, that, fit, within, a, successful, memeplex, may, gain, acceptance, by, piggybacking, on, the, success, of, the, memeplex, as, an, example, john, d, gottsch, discusses, the, transmission, mutation, and, selection, of, religious, memeplexes, and, the, theistic, memes, contained, theistic, memes, discussed, include, the, prohibition, of, aberrant, sexual, practices, such, as, incest, adultery, homosexuality, bestiality, castration, and, religious, prostitution, which, may, have, increased, vertical, transmission, of, the, parent, religious, memeplex, similar, memes, are, thereby, included, in, the, majority, of, religious, memeplexes, and, harden, over, time, they, become, an, inviolable, canon, or, set, of, dogmas, eventually, finding, their, way, into, secular, law, this, could, also, be, referred, to, as, the, propagation, of, a, taboo, memetics, is, the, name, of, the, field, of, science, that, studies, memes, and, their, evolution, and, culture, spread, while, the, term, meme, appeared, in, various, forms, in, german, and, austrian, texts, near, the, turn, of, the, 20th, century, dawkin, s, unrelated, use, of, the, term, in, the, selfish, gene, marked, its, emergence, into, mainstream, study, based, on, the, dawkin, s, framing, of, a, meme, as, a, cultural, analogue, to, a, gene, meme, theory, originated, as, an, attempt, to, apply, biological, evolutionary, principles, to, cultural, information, transfer, and, cultural, evolution, thus, memetics, attempts, to, apply, conventional, scientific, methods, such, as, those, used, in, population, genetics, and, epidemiology, to, explain, existing, patterns, and, transmission, of, cultural, ideas, principal, criticisms, of, memetics, include, the, claim, that, memetics, ignores, established, advances, in, other, fields, of, cultural, study, such, as, sociology, cultural, anthropology, cognitive, psychology, and, social, psychology, questions, remain, whether, or, not, the, meme, concept, counts, as, a, validly, disprovable, scientific, theory, this, view, regards, memetics, as, a, theory, in, its, infancy, a, protoscience, to, proponents, or, a, pseudoscience, to, some, detractors, one, frequent, criticism, of, meme, theory, looks, at, the, perceived, gap, in, the, gene, meme, analogy, for, example, luis, benitez, bribiesca, points, to, the, lack, of, a, code, script, for, memes, analogous, to, the, dna, of, genes, and, to, the, excessive, instability, of, the, meme, mutation, mechanism, that, of, an, idea, going, from, one, brain, to, another, which, would, lead, to, a, low, replication, accuracy, and, a, high, mutation, rate, rendering, the, evolutionary, process, chaotic, in, his, book, darwin, s, dangerous, idea, daniel, c, dennett, points, to, the, existence, of, self, regulating, correction, mechanisms, vaguely, resembling, those, of, gene, transcription, enabled, by, the, redundancy, and, other, properties, of, most, meme, expression, languages, which, stabilize, information, transfer, dennett, notes, that, spiritual, narratives, including, music, and, dance, forms, can, survive, in, full, detail, across, any, number, of, generations, even, in, cultures, with, oral, tradition, only, in, contrast, when, applying, only, meme, theory, memes, for, which, stable, copying, methods, are, available, will, inevitably, get, selected, for, survival, more, often, than, those, which, can, only, have, unstable, mutations, such, as, the, noted, music, and, dance, forms, which, according, to, meme, theory, should, have, resulted, in, those, forms, of, cultural, expression, going, extinct, a, second, common, criticism, of, meme, theory, views, it, as, a, reductionist, and, inadequate, version, of, more, accepted, anthropological, theories, kim, sterelny, and, paul, griffiths, noted, the, cumulative, evolution, of, genes, depends, on, biological, selection, pressures, neither, too, great, nor, too, small, in, relation, to, mutation, rates, while, pointing, out, there, is, no, reason, to, think, that, the, same, balance, will, exist, in, the, selection, pressures, on, memes, semiotic, theorists, such, as, terrence, deacon, and, kalevi, kull, regard, the, concept, of, a, meme, as, a, primitivized, or, degenerate, concept, of, a, sign, containing, only, a, sign, s, basic, ability, to, be, copied, but, lacks, other, core, elements, of, the, sign, concept, such, as, translation, and, interpretation, evolutionary, biologist, ernst, mayr, similarly, disapproved, of, dawkins, s, gene, based, view, of, meme, asserting, it, to, be, an, unnecessary, synonym, for, a, concept, reasoning, that, concepts, are, not, restricted, to, an, individual, or, a, generation, may, persist, for, long, periods, of, time, and, may, evolve, opinions, differ, as, to, how, best, to, apply, the, concept, of, memes, within, a, proper, disciplinary, framework, one, view, sees, memes, as, providing, a, useful, philosophical, perspective, with, which, to, examine, cultural, evolution, proponents, of, this, view, such, as, susan, blackmore, and, daniel, dennett, argue, that, considering, cultural, developments, from, a, meme, s, eye, view, as, if, memes, themselves, respond, to, pressure, to, maximise, their, own, replication, and, survival, can, lead, to, useful, insights, and, yield, valuable, predictions, into, how, culture, develops, over, time, others, such, as, bruce, edmonds, and, robert, aunger, have, focused, on, the, need, to, provide, an, empirical, grounding, for, memetics, to, become, a, useful, and, respected, scientific, discipline, a, third, approach, described, by, joseph, poulshock, as, radical, memetics, seeks, to, place, memes, at, the, centre, of, a, materialistic, theory, of, mind, and, of, personal, identity, prominent, researchers, in, evolutionary, psychology, and, anthropology, including, scott, atran, dan, sperber, pascal, boyer, john, tooby, and, others, argue, the, possibility, of, incompatibility, between, modularity, of, mind, and, memetics, in, their, view, minds, structure, certain, communicable, aspects, of, the, ideas, produced, and, these, communicable, aspects, generally, trigger, or, elicit, ideas, in, other, minds, through, inference, to, relatively, rich, structures, generated, from, often, low, fidelity, input, and, not, high, fidelity, replication, or, imitation, atran, discusses, communication, involving, religious, beliefs, as, a, case, in, point, in, one, set, of, experiments, he, asked, religious, people, to, write, down, on, a, piece, of, paper, the, meanings, of, the, ten, commandments, despite, the, subjects, own, expectations, of, consensus, interpretations, of, the, commandments, showed, wide, ranges, of, variation, with, little, evidence, of, consensus, in, another, experiment, subjects, with, autism, and, subjects, without, autism, interpreted, ideological, and, religious, sayings, for, example, let, a, thousand, flowers, bloom, or, to, everything, there, is, a, season, people, with, autism, showed, a, significant, tendency, to, closely, paraphrase, and, repeat, content, from, the, original, statement, for, example, don, t, cut, flowers, before, they, bloom, controls, tended, to, infer, a, wider, range, of, cultural, meanings, with, little, replicated, content, for, example, go, with, the, flow, or, everyone, should, have, equal, opportunity, only, the, subjects, with, autism, who, lack, the, degree, of, inferential, capacity, normally, associated, with, aspects, of, theory, of, mind, came, close, to, functioning, as, meme, machines, in, his, book, the, robot, s, rebellion, keith, stanovich, uses, the, memes, and, memeplex, concepts, to, describe, a, program, of, cognitive, reform, that, he, refers, to, as, a, rebellion, specifically, stanovich, argues, that, the, use, of, memes, as, a, descriptor, for, cultural, units, is, beneficial, because, it, serves, to, emphasize, transmission, and, acquisition, properties, that, parallel, the, study, of, epidemiology, these, properties, make, salient, the, sometimes, parasitic, nature, of, acquired, memes, and, as, a, result, individuals, should, be, motivated, to, reflectively, acquire, memes, using, what, he, calls, a, neurathian, bootstrap, process, in, cultural, software, a, theory, of, ideology, jack, balkin, argued, that, memetic, processes, can, explain, many, of, the, most, familiar, features, of, ideological, thought, his, theory, of, cultural, software, maintained, that, memes, form, narratives, social, networks, metaphoric, and, metonymic, models, and, a, variety, of, different, mental, structures, balkin, maintains, that, the, same, structures, used, to, generate, ideas, about, free, speech, or, free, markets, also, serve, to, generate, racistic, beliefs, to, balkin, whether, memes, become, harmful, or, maladaptive, depends, on, the, environmental, context, in, which, they, exist, rather, than, in, any, special, source, or, manner, to, their, origination, balkin, describes, racist, beliefs, as, fantasy, memes, that, become, harmful, or, unjust, ideologies, when, diverse, peoples, come, together, as, through, trade, or, competition, richard, dawkins, called, for, a, re, analysis, of, religion, in, terms, of, the, evolution, of, self, replicating, ideas, apart, from, any, resulting, biological, advantages, they, might, bestow, as, an, enthusiastic, darwinian, i, have, been, dissatisfied, with, explanations, that, my, fellow, enthusiasts, have, offered, for, human, behaviour, they, have, tried, to, look, for, biological, advantages, in, various, attributes, of, human, civilization, for, instance, tribal, religion, has, been, seen, as, a, mechanism, for, solidifying, group, identity, valuable, for, a, pack, hunting, species, whose, individuals, rely, on, cooperation, to, catch, large, and, fast, prey, frequently, the, evolutionary, preconception, in, terms, of, which, such, theories, are, framed, is, implicitly, group, selectionist, but, it, is, possible, to, rephrase, the, theories, in, terms, of, orthodox, gene, selection, he, argued, that, the, role, of, key, replicator, in, cultural, evolution, belongs, not, to, genes, but, to, memes, replicating, thought, from, person, to, person, by, means, of, imitation, these, replicators, respond, to, selective, pressures, that, may, or, may, not, affect, biological, reproduction, or, survival, in, her, book, the, meme, machine, susan, blackmore, regards, religions, as, particularly, tenacious, memes, many, of, the, features, common, to, the, most, widely, practiced, religions, provide, built, in, advantages, in, an, evolutionary, context, she, writes, for, example, religions, that, preach, of, the, value, of, faith, over, evidence, from, everyday, experience, or, reason, inoculate, societies, against, many, of, the, most, basic, tools, people, commonly, use, to, evaluate, their, ideas, by, linking, altruism, with, religious, affiliation, religious, memes, can, proliferate, more, quickly, because, people, perceive, that, they, can, reap, societal, as, well, as, personal, rewards, the, longevity, of, religious, memes, improves, with, their, documentation, in, revered, religious, texts, aaron, lynch, attributed, the, robustness, of, religious, memes, in, human, culture, to, the, fact, that, such, memes, incorporate, multiple, modes, of, meme, transmission, religious, memes, pass, down, the, generations, from, parent, to, child, and, across, a, single, generation, through, the, meme, exchange, of, proselytism, most, people, will, hold, the, religion, taught, them, by, their, parents, throughout, their, life, many, religions, feature, adversarial, elements, punishing, apostasy, for, instance, or, demonizing, infidels, in, thought, contagion, lynch, identifies, the, memes, of, transmission, in, christianity, as, especially, powerful, in, scope, believers, view, the, conversion, of, non, believers, both, as, a, religious, duty, and, as, an, act, of, altruism, the, promise, of, heaven, to, believers, and, threat, of, hell, to, non, believers, provide, a, strong, incentive, for, members, to, retain, their, belief, lynch, asserts, that, belief, in, the, crucifixion, of, jesus, in, christianity, amplifies, each, of, its, other, replication, advantages, through, the, indebtedness, believers, have, to, their, savior, for, sacrifice, on, the, cross, the, image, of, the, crucifixion, recurs, in, religious, sacraments, and, the, proliferation, of, symbols, of, the, cross, in, homes, and, churches, potently, reinforces, the, wide, array, of, christian, memes, although, religious, memes, have, proliferated, in, human, cultures, the, modern, scientific, community, has, been, relatively, resistant, to, religious, belief, robertson, 2007, reasoned, that, if, evolution, is, accelerated, in, conditions, of, propagative, difficulty, then, we, would, expect, to, encounter, variations, of, religious, memes, established, in, general, populations, addressed, to, scientific, communities, using, a, memetic, approach, robertson, deconstructed, two, attempts, to, privilege, religiously, held, spirituality, in, scientific, discourse, advantages, of, a, memetic, approach, as, compared, to, more, traditional, modernization, and, supply, side, theses, in, understanding, the, evolution, and, propagation, of, religion, were, explored, in, a, theory, of, architecture, nikos, salingaros, speaks, of, memes, as, freely, propagating, clusters, of, information, which, can, be, beneficial, or, harmful, he, contrasts, memes, to, patterns, and, true, knowledge, characterizing, memes, as, greatly, simplified, versions, of, patterns, and, as, unreasoned, matching, to, some, visual, or, mnemonic, prototype, taking, reference, to, dawkins, salingaros, emphasizes, that, they, can, be, transmitted, due, to, their, own, communicative, properties, that, the, simpler, they, are, the, faster, they, can, proliferate, and, that, the, most, successful, memes, come, with, a, great, psychological, appeal, architectural, memes, according, to, salingaros, can, have, destructive, power, images, portrayed, in, architectural, magazines, representing, buildings, that, could, not, possibly, accommodate, everyday, uses, become, fixed, in, our, memory, so, we, reproduce, them, unconsciously, he, lists, various, architectural, memes, that, circulated, since, the, 1920s, and, which, in, his, view, have, led, to, contemporary, architecture, becoming, quite, decoupled, from, human, needs, they, lack, connection, and, meaning, thereby, preventing, the, creation, of, true, connections, necessary, to, our, understanding, of, the, world, he, sees, them, as, no, different, from, antipatterns, in, software, design, as, solutions, that, are, false, but, are, re, utilized, nonetheless, an, internet, meme, is, a, concept, that, spreads, rapidly, from, person, to, person, via, the, internet, memes, can, spread, from, person, to, person, via, social, networks, blogs, direct, email, or, news, sources, sending, memes, as, a, form, of, affection, is, known, as, pebbling, in, 2013, dawkins, characterized, an, internet, meme, as, one, deliberately, altered, by, human, creativity, distinguished, from, his, original, idea, involving, mutation, by, random, change, and, a, form, of, darwinian, selection, internet, memes, are, an, example, of, dawkins, meme, theory, at, work, in, the, sense, of, how, they, so, rapidly, mirror, current, cultural, events, and, become, a, part, of, how, the, time, period, is, defined, limor, shifman, uses, the, example, of, the, gangnam, style, music, video, by, south, korean, pop, star, psy, that, went, viral, in, 2012, shifman, cites, examples, of, how, the, meme, mutated, itself, into, the, cultural, sphere, mixing, with, other, things, going, on, at, the, time, such, as, the, 2012, u, s, presidential, election, which, led, to, the, creation, of, mitt, romney, style, a, parody, of, the, original,
