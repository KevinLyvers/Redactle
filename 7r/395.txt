the, rosetta, stone, is, a, stele, of, granodiorite, inscribed, with, three, versions, of, a, decree, issued, in, 196, bc, during, the, ptolemaic, dynasty, of, egypt, on, behalf, of, king, ptolemy, v, epiphanes, the, top, and, middle, texts, are, in, ancient, egyptian, using, hieroglyphic, and, demotic, scripts, respectively, while, the, bottom, is, in, ancient, greek, the, decree, has, only, minor, differences, across, the, three, versions, making, the, rosetta, stone, key, to, deciphering, the, egyptian, scripts, the, stone, was, carved, during, the, hellenistic, period, and, is, believed, to, have, originally, been, displayed, within, a, temple, possibly, at, sais, it, was, probably, moved, in, late, antiquity, or, during, the, mamluk, period, and, was, eventually, used, as, building, material, in, the, construction, of, fort, julien, near, the, town, of, rashid, rosetta, in, the, nile, delta, it, was, found, there, in, july, 1799, by, french, officer, pierre, fran, ois, bouchard, during, the, napoleonic, campaign, in, egypt, it, was, the, first, ancient, egyptian, bilingual, text, recovered, in, modern, times, and, it, aroused, widespread, public, interest, with, its, potential, to, decipher, this, previously, untranslated, hieroglyphic, script, lithographic, copies, and, plaster, casts, soon, began, circulating, among, european, museums, and, scholars, when, the, british, defeated, the, french, they, took, the, stone, to, london, under, the, terms, of, the, capitulation, of, alexandria, in, 1801, since, 1802, it, has, been, on, public, display, at, the, british, museum, almost, continuously, and, it, is, the, most, visited, object, there, study, of, the, decree, was, already, underway, when, the, first, complete, translation, of, the, greek, text, was, published, in, 1803, jean, fran, ois, champollion, announced, the, transliteration, of, the, egyptian, scripts, in, paris, in, 1822, it, took, longer, still, before, scholars, were, able, to, read, ancient, egyptian, inscriptions, and, literature, confidently, major, advances, in, the, decoding, were, recognition, that, the, stone, offered, three, versions, of, the, same, text, 1799, that, the, demotic, text, used, phonetic, characters, to, spell, foreign, names, 1802, that, the, hieroglyphic, text, did, so, as, well, and, had, pervasive, similarities, to, the, demotic, 1814, and, that, phonetic, characters, were, also, used, to, spell, native, egyptian, words, 1822, 1824, three, other, fragmentary, copies, of, the, same, decree, were, discovered, later, and, several, similar, egyptian, bilingual, or, trilingual, inscriptions, are, now, known, including, three, slightly, earlier, ptolemaic, decrees, the, decree, of, alexandria, in, 243, bc, the, decree, of, canopus, in, 238, bc, and, the, memphis, decree, of, ptolemy, iv, c, 218, bc, though, the, rosetta, stone, is, known, to, be, no, longer, unique, it, was, the, essential, key, to, the, modern, understanding, of, ancient, egyptian, literature, and, civilisation, the, term, rosetta, stone, is, now, used, to, refer, to, the, essential, clue, to, a, new, field, of, knowledge, the, rosetta, stone, is, listed, as, a, stone, of, black, granodiorite, bearing, three, inscriptions, found, at, rosetta, in, a, contemporary, catalogue, of, the, artefacts, discovered, by, the, french, expedition, and, surrendered, to, british, troops, in, 1801, at, some, period, after, its, arrival, in, london, the, inscriptions, were, coloured, in, white, chalk, to, make, them, more, legible, and, the, remaining, surface, was, covered, with, a, layer, of, carnauba, wax, designed, to, protect, it, from, visitors, fingers, this, gave, a, dark, colour, to, the, stone, that, led, to, its, mistaken, identification, as, black, basalt, these, additions, were, removed, when, the, stone, was, cleaned, in, 1999, revealing, the, original, dark, grey, tint, of, the, rock, the, sparkle, of, its, crystalline, structure, and, a, pink, vein, running, across, the, top, left, corner, comparisons, with, the, klemm, collection, of, egyptian, rock, samples, showed, a, close, resemblance, to, rock, from, a, small, granodiorite, quarry, at, gebel, tingar, on, the, west, bank, of, the, nile, west, of, elephantine, in, the, region, of, aswan, the, pink, vein, is, typical, of, granodiorite, from, this, region, the, rosetta, stone, is, 1, 123, millimetres, 3, ft, 8, in, high, at, its, highest, point, 757, mm, 2, ft, 5, 8, in, wide, and, 284, mm, 11, in, thick, it, weighs, approximately, 760, kilograms, 1, 680, lb, it, bears, three, inscriptions, the, top, register, in, ancient, egyptian, hieroglyphs, the, second, in, the, egyptian, demotic, script, and, the, third, in, ancient, greek, these, three, scripts, are, not, three, different, languages, as, is, commonly, misunderstood, the, front, surface, is, polished, and, the, inscriptions, lightly, incised, on, it, the, sides, of, the, stone, are, smoothed, but, the, back, is, only, roughly, worked, presumably, because, it, would, have, not, been, visible, when, the, stele, was, erected, the, rosetta, stone, is, a, fragment, of, a, larger, stele, no, additional, fragments, were, found, in, later, searches, of, the, rosetta, site, owing, to, its, damaged, state, none, of, the, three, texts, is, complete, the, top, register, composed, of, egyptian, hieroglyphs, suffered, the, most, damage, only, the, last, 14, lines, of, the, hieroglyphic, text, can, be, seen, all, of, them, are, broken, on, the, right, side, and, 12, of, them, on, the, left, below, it, the, middle, register, of, demotic, text, has, survived, best, it, has, 32, lines, of, which, the, first, 14, are, slightly, damaged, on, the, right, side, the, bottom, register, of, greek, text, contains, 54, lines, of, which, the, first, 27, survive, in, full, the, rest, are, increasingly, fragmentary, due, to, a, diagonal, break, at, the, bottom, right, of, the, stone, the, stele, was, erected, after, the, coronation, of, king, ptolemy, v, and, was, inscribed, with, a, decree, that, established, the, divine, cult, of, the, new, ruler, the, decree, was, issued, by, a, congress, of, priests, who, gathered, at, memphis, the, date, is, given, as, 4, xandikos, in, the, macedonian, calendar, and, 18, mekhir, in, the, egyptian, calendar, which, corresponds, to, 27, march, 196, bc, the, year, is, stated, as, the, ninth, year, of, ptolemy, v, s, reign, equated, with, 197, 196, bc, which, is, confirmed, by, naming, four, priests, who, officiated, in, that, year, aetos, son, of, aetos, was, priest, of, the, divine, cults, of, alexander, the, great, and, the, five, ptolemies, down, to, ptolemy, v, himself, the, other, three, priests, named, in, turn, in, the, inscription, are, those, who, led, the, worship, of, berenice, euergetis, wife, of, ptolemy, iii, arsinoe, philadelphos, wife, and, sister, of, ptolemy, ii, and, arsinoe, philopator, mother, of, ptolemy, v, however, a, second, date, is, also, given, in, the, greek, and, hieroglyphic, texts, corresponding, to, 27, november, 197, bc, the, official, anniversary, of, ptolemy, s, coronation, the, demotic, text, conflicts, with, this, listing, consecutive, days, in, march, for, the, decree, and, the, anniversary, it, is, uncertain, why, this, discrepancy, exists, but, it, is, clear, that, the, decree, was, issued, in, 196, bc, and, that, it, was, designed, to, re, establish, the, rule, of, the, ptolemaic, kings, over, egypt, the, decree, was, issued, during, a, turbulent, period, in, egyptian, history, ptolemy, v, epiphanes, the, son, of, ptolemy, iv, philopator, and, his, wife, and, sister, arsinoe, reigned, from, 204, to, 181, bc, he, had, become, ruler, at, the, age, of, five, after, the, sudden, death, of, both, of, his, parents, who, were, murdered, in, a, conspiracy, that, involved, ptolemy, iv, s, mistress, agathoclea, according, to, contemporary, sources, the, conspirators, effectively, ruled, egypt, as, ptolemy, v, s, guardians, until, a, revolt, broke, out, two, years, later, under, general, tlepolemus, when, agathoclea, and, her, family, were, lynched, by, a, mob, in, alexandria, tlepolemus, in, turn, was, replaced, as, guardian, in, 201, bc, by, aristomenes, of, alyzia, who, was, chief, minister, at, the, time, of, the, memphis, decree, political, forces, beyond, the, borders, of, egypt, exacerbated, the, internal, problems, of, the, ptolemaic, kingdom, antiochus, iii, the, great, and, philip, v, of, macedon, had, made, a, pact, to, divide, egypt, s, overseas, possessions, philip, had, seized, several, islands, and, cities, in, caria, and, thrace, while, the, battle, of, panium, 198, bc, had, resulted, in, the, transfer, of, coele, syria, including, judaea, from, the, ptolemies, to, the, seleucids, meanwhile, in, the, south, of, egypt, there, was, a, long, standing, revolt, that, had, begun, during, the, reign, of, ptolemy, iv, led, by, horwennefer, and, by, his, successor, ankhwennefer, both, the, war, and, the, internal, revolt, were, still, ongoing, when, the, young, ptolemy, v, was, officially, crowned, at, memphis, at, the, age, of, 12, seven, years, after, the, start, of, his, reign, and, when, just, over, a, year, later, the, memphis, decree, was, issued, stelae, of, this, kind, which, were, established, on, the, initiative, of, the, temples, rather, than, that, of, the, king, are, unique, to, ptolemaic, egypt, in, the, preceding, pharaonic, period, it, would, have, been, unheard, of, for, anyone, but, the, divine, rulers, themselves, to, make, national, decisions, by, contrast, this, way, of, honouring, a, king, was, a, feature, of, greek, cities, rather, than, making, his, eulogy, himself, the, king, had, himself, glorified, and, deified, by, his, subjects, or, representative, groups, of, his, subjects, the, decree, records, that, ptolemy, v, gave, a, gift, of, silver, and, grain, to, the, temples, it, also, records, that, there, was, particularly, high, flooding, of, the, nile, in, the, eighth, year, of, his, reign, and, he, had, the, excess, waters, dammed, for, the, benefit, of, the, farmers, in, return, the, priesthood, pledged, that, the, king, s, birthday, and, coronation, days, would, be, celebrated, annually, and, that, all, the, priests, of, egypt, would, serve, him, alongside, the, other, gods, the, decree, concludes, with, the, instruction, that, a, copy, was, to, be, placed, in, every, temple, inscribed, in, the, language, of, the, gods, egyptian, hieroglyphs, the, language, of, documents, demotic, and, the, language, of, the, greeks, as, used, by, the, ptolemaic, government, securing, the, favour, of, the, priesthood, was, essential, for, the, ptolemaic, kings, to, retain, effective, rule, over, the, populace, the, high, priests, of, memphis, where, the, king, was, crowned, were, particularly, important, as, they, were, the, highest, religious, authorities, of, the, time, and, had, influence, throughout, the, kingdom, given, that, the, decree, was, issued, at, memphis, the, ancient, capital, of, egypt, rather, than, alexandria, the, centre, of, government, of, the, ruling, ptolemies, it, is, evident, that, the, young, king, was, anxious, to, gain, their, active, support, thus, although, the, government, of, egypt, had, been, greek, speaking, ever, since, the, conquests, of, alexander, the, great, the, memphis, decree, like, the, three, similar, earlier, decrees, included, texts, in, egyptian, to, show, its, connection, to, the, general, populace, by, way, of, the, literate, egyptian, priesthood, there, can, be, no, one, definitive, english, translation, of, the, decree, not, only, because, modern, understanding, of, the, ancient, languages, continues, to, develop, but, also, because, of, the, minor, differences, between, the, three, original, texts, older, translations, by, e, a, wallis, budge, 1904, 1913, and, edwyn, r, bevan, 1927, are, easily, available, but, are, now, outdated, as, can, be, seen, by, comparing, them, with, the, recent, translation, by, r, s, simpson, which, is, based, on, the, demotic, text, and, can, be, found, online, or, with, the, modern, translations, of, all, three, texts, with, introduction, and, facsimile, drawing, that, were, published, by, quirke, and, andrews, in, 1989, the, stele, was, almost, certainly, not, originally, placed, at, rashid, rosetta, where, it, was, found, but, more, likely, came, from, a, temple, site, farther, inland, possibly, the, royal, town, of, sais, the, temple, from, which, it, originally, came, was, probably, closed, around, ad, 392, when, roman, emperor, theodosius, i, ordered, the, closing, of, all, non, christian, temples, of, worship, the, original, stele, broke, at, some, point, its, largest, piece, becoming, what, we, now, know, as, the, rosetta, stone, ancient, egyptian, temples, were, later, used, as, quarries, for, new, construction, and, the, rosetta, stone, probably, was, re, used, in, this, manner, later, it, was, incorporated, in, the, foundations, of, a, fortress, constructed, by, the, mameluke, sultan, qaitbay, c, 1416, 18, 1496, to, defend, the, bolbitine, branch, of, the, nile, at, rashid, there, it, lay, for, at, least, another, three, centuries, until, its, rediscovery, three, other, inscriptions, relevant, to, the, same, memphis, decree, have, been, found, since, the, discovery, of, the, rosetta, stone, the, nubayrah, stele, a, stele, found, in, elephantine, and, noub, taha, and, an, inscription, found, at, the, temple, of, philae, on, the, philae, obelisk, unlike, the, rosetta, stone, the, hieroglyphic, texts, of, these, inscriptions, were, relatively, intact, the, rosetta, stone, had, been, deciphered, long, before, they, were, found, but, later, egyptologists, have, used, them, to, refine, the, reconstruction, of, the, hieroglyphs, that, must, have, been, used, in, the, lost, portions, of, the, hieroglyphic, text, on, the, rosetta, stone, french, forces, under, napoleon, bonaparte, invaded, egypt, in, 1798, accompanied, by, a, corps, of, 151, technical, experts, savants, known, as, the, commission, des, sciences, et, des, arts, on, 15, july, 1799, french, soldiers, under, the, command, of, colonel, d, hautpoul, were, strengthening, the, defences, of, fort, julien, a, couple, of, miles, north, east, of, the, egyptian, port, city, of, rosetta, modern, day, rashid, lieutenant, pierre, fran, ois, bouchard, spotted, a, slab, with, inscriptions, on, one, side, that, the, soldiers, had, uncovered, when, demolishing, a, wall, within, the, fort, he, and, d, hautpoul, saw, at, once, that, it, might, be, important, and, informed, general, jacques, fran, ois, menou, who, happened, to, be, at, rosetta, the, find, was, announced, to, napoleon, s, newly, founded, scientific, association, in, cairo, the, institut, d, gypte, in, a, report, by, commission, member, michel, ange, lancret, noting, that, it, contained, three, inscriptions, the, first, in, hieroglyphs, and, the, third, in, greek, and, rightly, suggesting, that, the, three, inscriptions, were, versions, of, the, same, text, lancret, s, report, dated, 19, july, 1799, was, read, to, a, meeting, of, the, institute, soon, after, 25, july, bouchard, meanwhile, transported, the, stone, to, cairo, for, examination, by, scholars, the, discovery, was, reported, in, september, in, courrier, de, l, gypte, the, official, newspaper, of, the, french, expedition, the, anonymous, reporter, expressed, a, hope, that, the, stone, might, one, day, be, the, key, to, deciphering, hieroglyphs, in, 1800, three, of, the, commission, s, technical, experts, devised, ways, to, make, copies, of, the, texts, on, the, stone, one, of, these, experts, was, jean, joseph, marcel, a, printer, and, gifted, linguist, who, is, credited, as, the, first, to, recognise, that, the, middle, text, was, written, in, the, egyptian, demotic, script, rarely, used, for, stone, inscriptions, and, seldom, seen, by, scholars, at, that, time, rather, than, syriac, as, had, originally, been, thought, it, was, artist, and, inventor, nicolas, jacques, cont, who, found, a, way, to, use, the, stone, itself, as, a, printing, block, to, reproduce, the, inscription, a, slightly, different, method, was, adopted, by, antoine, galland, the, prints, that, resulted, were, taken, to, paris, by, general, charles, dugua, scholars, in, europe, were, now, able, to, see, the, inscriptions, and, attempt, to, read, them, after, napoleon, s, departure, french, troops, held, off, british, and, ottoman, attacks, for, another, 18, months, in, march, 1801, the, british, landed, at, aboukir, bay, menou, was, now, in, command, of, the, french, expedition, his, troops, including, the, commission, marched, north, towards, the, mediterranean, coast, to, meet, the, enemy, transporting, the, stone, along, with, many, other, antiquities, he, was, defeated, in, battle, and, the, remnant, of, his, army, retreated, to, alexandria, where, they, were, surrounded, and, besieged, with, the, stone, now, inside, the, city, menou, surrendered, on, 30, august, after, the, surrender, a, dispute, arose, over, the, fate, of, the, french, archaeological, and, scientific, discoveries, in, egypt, including, the, artefacts, biological, specimens, notes, plans, and, drawings, collected, by, the, members, of, the, commission, menou, refused, to, hand, them, over, claiming, that, they, belonged, to, the, institute, british, general, john, hely, hutchinson, refused, to, end, the, siege, until, menou, gave, in, scholars, edward, daniel, clarke, and, william, richard, hamilton, newly, arrived, from, england, agreed, to, examine, the, collections, in, alexandria, and, said, they, had, found, many, artefacts, that, the, french, had, not, revealed, in, a, letter, home, clarke, said, that, we, found, much, more, in, their, possession, than, was, represented, or, imagined, hutchinson, claimed, that, all, materials, were, property, of, the, british, crown, but, french, scholar, tienne, geoffroy, saint, hilaire, told, clarke, and, hamilton, that, the, french, would, rather, burn, all, their, discoveries, than, turn, them, over, referring, ominously, to, the, destruction, of, the, library, of, alexandria, clarke, and, hamilton, pleaded, the, french, scholars, case, to, hutchinson, who, finally, agreed, that, items, such, as, natural, history, specimens, would, be, considered, the, scholars, private, property, menou, quickly, claimed, the, stone, too, as, his, private, property, hutchinson, was, equally, aware, of, the, stone, s, unique, value, and, rejected, menou, s, claim, eventually, an, agreement, was, reached, and, the, transfer, of, the, objects, was, incorporated, into, the, capitulation, of, alexandria, signed, by, representatives, of, the, british, french, and, ottoman, forces, it, is, not, clear, exactly, how, the, stone, was, transferred, into, british, hands, as, contemporary, accounts, differ, colonel, tomkyns, hilgrove, turner, who, was, to, escort, it, to, england, claimed, later, that, he, had, personally, seized, it, from, menou, and, carried, it, away, on, a, gun, carriage, in, a, much, more, detailed, account, edward, daniel, clarke, stated, that, a, french, officer, and, member, of, the, institute, had, taken, him, his, student, john, cripps, and, hamilton, secretly, into, the, back, streets, behind, menou, s, residence, and, revealed, the, stone, hidden, under, protective, carpets, among, menou, s, baggage, according, to, clarke, their, informant, feared, that, the, stone, might, be, stolen, if, french, soldiers, saw, it, hutchinson, was, informed, at, once, and, the, stone, was, taken, away, possibly, by, turner, and, his, gun, carriage, turner, brought, the, stone, to, england, aboard, the, captured, french, frigate, hms, gyptienne, landing, in, portsmouth, in, february, 1802, his, orders, were, to, present, it, and, the, other, antiquities, to, king, george, iii, the, king, represented, by, war, secretary, lord, hobart, directed, that, it, should, be, placed, in, the, british, museum, according, to, turner, s, narrative, he, and, hobart, agreed, that, the, stone, should, be, presented, to, scholars, at, the, society, of, antiquaries, of, london, of, which, turner, was, a, member, before, its, final, deposit, in, the, museum, it, was, first, seen, and, discussed, there, at, a, meeting, on, 11, march, 1802, in, 1802, the, society, created, four, plaster, casts, of, the, inscriptions, which, were, given, to, the, universities, of, oxford, cambridge, and, edinburgh, and, to, trinity, college, dublin, soon, afterwards, prints, of, the, inscriptions, were, made, and, circulated, to, european, scholars, before, the, end, of, 1802, the, stone, was, transferred, to, the, british, museum, where, it, is, located, today, new, inscriptions, painted, in, white, on, the, left, and, right, edges, of, the, slab, stated, that, it, was, captured, in, egypt, by, the, british, army, in, 1801, and, presented, by, king, george, iii, the, stone, has, been, exhibited, almost, continuously, in, the, british, museum, since, june, 1802, during, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, it, was, given, the, inventory, number, ea, 24, ea, standing, for, egyptian, antiquities, it, was, part, of, a, collection, of, ancient, egyptian, monuments, captured, from, the, french, expedition, including, a, sarcophagus, of, nectanebo, ii, ea, 10, the, statue, of, a, high, priest, of, amun, ea, 81, and, a, large, granite, fist, ea, 9, the, objects, were, soon, discovered, to, be, too, heavy, for, the, floors, of, montagu, house, the, original, building, of, the, british, museum, and, they, were, transferred, to, a, new, extension, that, was, added, to, the, mansion, the, rosetta, stone, was, transferred, to, the, sculpture, gallery, in, 1834, shortly, after, montagu, house, was, demolished, and, replaced, by, the, building, that, now, houses, the, british, museum, according, to, the, museum, s, records, the, rosetta, stone, is, its, most, visited, single, object, a, simple, image, of, it, was, the, museum, s, best, selling, postcard, for, several, decades, and, a, wide, variety, of, merchandise, bearing, the, text, from, the, rosetta, stone, or, replicating, its, distinctive, shape, is, sold, in, the, museum, shops, the, rosetta, stone, was, originally, displayed, at, a, slight, angle, from, the, horizontal, and, rested, within, a, metal, cradle, that, was, made, for, it, which, involved, shaving, off, very, small, portions, of, its, sides, to, ensure, that, the, cradle, fitted, securely, it, originally, had, no, protective, covering, and, it, was, found, necessary, by, 1847, to, place, it, in, a, protective, frame, despite, the, presence, of, attendants, to, ensure, that, it, was, not, touched, by, visitors, since, 2004, the, conserved, stone, has, been, on, display, in, a, specially, built, case, in, the, centre, of, the, egyptian, sculpture, gallery, a, replica, of, the, rosetta, stone, is, now, available, in, the, king, s, library, of, the, british, museum, without, a, case, and, free, to, touch, as, it, would, have, appeared, to, early, 19th, century, visitors, the, museum, was, concerned, about, heavy, bombing, in, london, towards, the, end, of, the, first, world, war, in, 1917, and, the, rosetta, stone, was, moved, to, safety, along, with, other, portable, objects, of, value, the, stone, spent, the, next, two, years, 15, m, 50, ft, below, ground, level, in, a, station, of, the, postal, tube, railway, at, mount, pleasant, near, holborn, other, than, during, wartime, the, rosetta, stone, has, left, the, british, museum, only, once, for, one, month, in, october, 1972, to, be, displayed, alongside, champollion, s, lettre, at, the, louvre, in, paris, on, the, 150th, anniversary, of, the, letter, s, publication, even, when, the, rosetta, stone, was, undergoing, conservation, measures, in, 1999, the, work, was, done, in, the, gallery, so, that, it, could, remain, visible, to, the, public, prior, to, the, discovery, of, the, rosetta, stone, and, its, eventual, decipherment, the, ancient, egyptian, language, and, script, had, not, been, understood, since, shortly, before, the, fall, of, the, roman, empire, the, usage, of, the, hieroglyphic, script, had, become, increasingly, specialised, even, in, the, later, pharaonic, period, by, the, 4th, century, ad, few, egyptians, were, capable, of, reading, them, monumental, use, of, hieroglyphs, ceased, as, temple, priesthoods, died, out, and, egypt, was, converted, to, christianity, the, last, known, inscription, is, dated, to, 24, august, 394, found, at, philae, and, known, as, the, graffito, of, esmet, akhom, the, last, demotic, text, also, from, philae, was, written, in, 452, hieroglyphs, retained, their, pictorial, appearance, and, classical, authors, emphasised, this, aspect, in, sharp, contrast, to, the, greek, and, roman, alphabets, in, the, 5th, century, the, priest, horapollo, wrote, hieroglyphica, an, explanation, of, almost, 200, glyphs, his, work, was, believed, to, be, authoritative, yet, it, was, misleading, in, many, ways, and, this, and, other, works, were, a, lasting, impediment, to, the, understanding, of, egyptian, writing, later, attempts, at, decipherment, were, made, by, arab, historians, in, medieval, egypt, during, the, 9th, and, 10th, centuries, dhul, nun, al, misri, and, ibn, wahshiyya, were, the, first, historians, to, study, hieroglyphs, by, comparing, them, to, the, contemporary, coptic, language, used, by, coptic, priests, in, their, time, the, study, of, hieroglyphs, continued, with, fruitless, attempts, at, decipherment, by, european, scholars, notably, pierius, valerianus, in, the, 16th, century, and, athanasius, kircher, in, the, 17th, the, discovery, of, the, rosetta, stone, in, 1799, provided, critical, missing, information, gradually, revealed, by, a, succession, of, scholars, that, eventually, allowed, jean, fran, ois, champollion, to, solve, the, puzzle, that, kircher, had, called, the, riddle, of, the, sphinx, the, greek, text, on, the, rosetta, stone, provided, the, starting, point, ancient, greek, was, widely, known, to, scholars, but, they, were, not, familiar, with, details, of, its, use, in, the, hellenistic, period, as, a, government, language, in, ptolemaic, egypt, large, scale, discoveries, of, greek, papyri, were, a, long, way, in, the, future, thus, the, earliest, translations, of, the, greek, text, of, the, stone, show, the, translators, still, struggling, with, the, historical, context, and, with, administrative, and, religious, jargon, stephen, weston, verbally, presented, an, english, translation, of, the, greek, text, at, a, society, of, antiquaries, meeting, in, april, 1802, meanwhile, two, of, the, lithographic, copies, made, in, egypt, had, reached, the, institut, de, france, in, paris, in, 1801, there, librarian, and, antiquarian, gabriel, de, la, porte, du, theil, set, to, work, on, a, translation, of, the, greek, but, he, was, dispatched, elsewhere, on, napoleon, s, orders, almost, immediately, and, he, left, his, unfinished, work, in, the, hands, of, colleague, hubert, pascal, ameilhon, ameilhon, produced, the, first, published, translations, of, the, greek, text, in, 1803, in, both, latin, and, french, to, ensure, that, they, would, circulate, widely, at, cambridge, richard, porson, worked, on, the, missing, lower, right, corner, of, the, greek, text, he, produced, a, skilful, suggested, reconstruction, which, was, soon, being, circulated, by, the, society, of, antiquaries, alongside, its, prints, of, the, inscription, at, almost, the, same, moment, christian, gottlob, heyne, in, g, ttingen, was, making, a, new, latin, translation, of, the, greek, text, that, was, more, reliable, than, ameilhon, s, and, was, first, published, in, 1803, it, was, reprinted, by, the, society, of, antiquaries, in, a, special, issue, of, its, journal, archaeologia, in, 1811, alongside, weston, s, previously, unpublished, english, translation, colonel, turner, s, narrative, and, other, documents, at, the, time, of, the, stone, s, discovery, swedish, diplomat, and, scholar, johan, david, kerblad, was, working, on, a, little, known, script, of, which, some, examples, had, recently, been, found, in, egypt, which, came, to, be, known, as, demotic, he, called, it, cursive, coptic, because, he, was, convinced, that, it, was, used, to, record, some, form, of, the, coptic, language, the, direct, descendant, of, ancient, egyptian, although, it, had, few, similarities, with, the, later, coptic, script, french, orientalist, antoine, isaac, silvestre, de, sacy, had, been, discussing, this, work, with, kerblad, when, in, 1801, he, received, one, of, the, early, lithographic, prints, of, the, rosetta, stone, from, jean, antoine, chaptal, french, minister, of, the, interior, he, realised, that, the, middle, text, was, in, this, same, script, he, and, kerblad, set, to, work, both, focusing, on, the, middle, text, and, assuming, that, the, script, was, alphabetical, they, attempted, to, identify, the, points, where, greek, names, ought, to, occur, within, this, unknown, text, by, comparing, it, with, the, greek, in, 1802, silvestre, de, sacy, reported, to, chaptal, that, he, had, successfully, identified, five, names, alexandros, alexandreia, ptolemaios, arsinoe, and, ptolemy, s, title, epiphanes, while, kerblad, published, an, alphabet, of, 29, letters, more, than, half, of, which, were, correct, that, he, had, identified, from, the, greek, names, in, the, demotic, text, they, could, not, however, identify, the, remaining, characters, in, the, demotic, text, which, as, is, now, known, included, ideographic, and, other, symbols, alongside, the, phonetic, ones, silvestre, de, sacy, eventually, gave, up, work, on, the, stone, but, he, was, to, make, another, contribution, in, 1811, prompted, by, discussions, with, a, chinese, student, about, chinese, script, silvestre, de, sacy, considered, a, suggestion, made, by, georg, zo, ga, in, 1797, that, the, foreign, names, in, egyptian, hieroglyphic, inscriptions, might, be, written, phonetically, he, also, recalled, that, as, early, as, 1761, jean, jacques, barth, lemy, had, suggested, that, the, characters, enclosed, in, cartouches, in, hieroglyphic, inscriptions, were, proper, names, thus, when, thomas, young, foreign, secretary, of, the, royal, society, of, london, wrote, to, him, about, the, stone, in, 1814, silvestre, de, sacy, suggested, in, reply, that, in, attempting, to, read, the, hieroglyphic, text, young, might, look, for, cartouches, that, ought, to, contain, greek, names, and, try, to, identify, phonetic, characters, in, them, young, did, so, with, two, results, that, together, paved, the, way, for, the, final, decipherment, in, the, hieroglyphic, text, he, discovered, the, phonetic, characters, p, t, o, l, m, e, s, in, today, s, transliteration, p, t, w, l, m, y, s, that, were, used, to, write, the, greek, name, ptolemaios, he, also, noticed, that, these, characters, resembled, the, equivalent, ones, in, the, demotic, script, and, went, on, to, note, as, many, as, 80, similarities, between, the, hieroglyphic, and, demotic, texts, on, the, stone, an, important, discovery, because, the, two, scripts, were, previously, thought, to, be, entirely, different, from, one, another, this, led, him, to, deduce, correctly, that, the, demotic, script, was, only, partly, phonetic, also, consisting, of, ideographic, characters, derived, from, hieroglyphs, young, s, new, insights, were, prominent, in, the, long, article, egypt, that, he, contributed, to, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, in, 1819, he, could, make, no, further, progress, however, in, 1814, young, first, exchanged, correspondence, about, the, stone, with, jean, fran, ois, champollion, a, teacher, at, grenoble, who, had, produced, a, scholarly, work, on, ancient, egypt, champollion, saw, copies, of, the, brief, hieroglyphic, and, greek, inscriptions, of, the, philae, obelisk, in, 1822, on, which, william, john, bankes, had, tentatively, noted, the, names, ptolemaios, and, kleopatra, in, both, languages, from, this, champollion, identified, the, phonetic, characters, k, l, e, o, p, a, t, r, a, in, today, s, transliteration, q, l, i, w, p, 3, d, r, 3, t, on, the, basis, of, this, and, the, foreign, names, on, the, rosetta, stone, he, quickly, constructed, an, alphabet, of, phonetic, hieroglyphic, characters, completing, his, work, on, 14, september, and, announcing, it, publicly, on, 27, september, in, a, lecture, to, the, acad, mie, royale, des, inscriptions, et, belles, lettres, on, the, same, day, he, wrote, the, famous, lettre, m, dacier, to, bon, joseph, dacier, secretary, of, the, acad, mie, detailing, his, discovery, in, the, postscript, champollion, notes, that, similar, phonetic, characters, seemed, to, occur, in, both, greek, and, egyptian, names, a, hypothesis, confirmed, in, 1823, when, he, identified, the, names, of, pharaohs, ramesses, and, thutmose, written, in, cartouches, at, abu, simbel, these, far, older, hieroglyphic, inscriptions, had, been, copied, by, bankes, and, sent, to, champollion, by, jean, nicolas, huyot, from, this, point, the, stories, of, the, rosetta, stone, and, the, decipherment, of, egyptian, hieroglyphs, diverge, as, champollion, drew, on, many, other, texts, to, develop, an, ancient, egyptian, grammar, and, a, hieroglyphic, dictionary, which, were, published, after, his, death, in, 1832, work, on, the, stone, now, focused, on, fuller, understanding, of, the, texts, and, their, contexts, by, comparing, the, three, versions, with, one, another, in, 1824, classical, scholar, antoine, jean, letronne, promised, to, prepare, a, new, literal, translation, of, the, greek, text, for, champollion, s, use, champollion, in, return, promised, an, analysis, of, all, the, points, at, which, the, three, texts, seemed, to, differ, following, champollion, s, sudden, death, in, 1832, his, draft, of, this, analysis, could, not, be, found, and, letronne, s, work, stalled, fran, ois, salvolini, champollion, s, former, student, and, assistant, died, in, 1838, and, this, analysis, and, other, missing, drafts, were, found, among, his, papers, this, discovery, incidentally, demonstrated, that, salvolini, s, own, publication, on, the, stone, published, in, 1837, was, plagiarism, letronne, was, at, last, able, to, complete, his, commentary, on, the, greek, text, and, his, new, french, translation, of, it, which, appeared, in, 1841, during, the, early, 1850s, german, egyptologists, heinrich, brugsch, and, max, uhlemann, produced, revised, latin, translations, based, on, the, demotic, and, hieroglyphic, texts, the, first, english, translation, followed, in, 1858, the, work, of, three, members, of, the, philomathean, society, at, the, university, of, pennsylvania, whether, one, of, the, three, texts, was, the, standard, version, from, which, the, other, two, were, originally, translated, is, a, question, that, has, remained, controversial, letronne, attempted, to, show, in, 1841, that, the, greek, version, the, product, of, the, egyptian, government, under, the, macedonian, ptolemies, was, the, original, among, recent, authors, john, ray, has, stated, that, the, hieroglyphs, were, the, most, important, of, the, scripts, on, the, stone, they, were, there, for, the, gods, to, read, and, the, more, learned, of, their, priesthood, philippe, derchain, and, heinz, josef, thissen, have, argued, that, all, three, versions, were, composed, simultaneously, while, stephen, quirke, sees, in, the, decree, an, intricate, coalescence, of, three, vital, textual, traditions, richard, parkinson, points, out, that, the, hieroglyphic, version, strays, from, archaic, formalism, and, occasionally, lapses, into, language, closer, to, that, of, the, demotic, register, that, the, priests, more, commonly, used, in, everyday, life, the, fact, that, the, three, versions, cannot, be, matched, word, for, word, helps, to, explain, why, the, decipherment, has, been, more, difficult, than, originally, expected, especially, for, those, original, scholars, who, were, expecting, an, exact, bilingual, key, to, egyptian, hieroglyphs, even, before, the, salvolini, affair, disputes, over, precedence, and, plagiarism, punctuated, the, decipherment, story, thomas, young, s, work, is, acknowledged, in, champollion, s, 1822, lettre, m, dacier, but, incompletely, according, to, early, british, critics, for, example, james, browne, a, sub, editor, on, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, which, had, published, young, s, 1819, article, anonymously, contributed, a, series, of, review, articles, to, the, edinburgh, review, in, 1823, praising, young, s, work, highly, and, alleging, that, the, unscrupulous, champollion, plagiarised, it, these, articles, were, translated, into, french, by, julius, klaproth, and, published, in, book, form, in, 1827, young, s, own, 1823, publication, reasserted, the, contribution, that, he, had, made, the, early, deaths, of, young, 1829, and, champollion, 1832, did, not, put, an, end, to, these, disputes, in, his, work, on, the, stone, in, 1904, e, a, wallis, budge, gave, special, emphasis, to, young, s, contribution, compared, with, champollion, s, in, the, early, 1970s, french, visitors, complained, that, the, portrait, of, champollion, was, smaller, than, one, of, young, on, an, adjacent, information, panel, english, visitors, complained, that, the, opposite, was, true, the, portraits, were, in, fact, the, same, size, calls, for, the, rosetta, stone, to, be, returned, to, egypt, were, made, in, july, 2003, by, zahi, hawass, then, secretary, general, of, egypt, s, supreme, council, of, antiquities, these, calls, expressed, in, the, egyptian, and, international, media, asked, that, the, stele, be, repatriated, to, egypt, commenting, that, it, was, the, icon, of, our, egyptian, identity, he, repeated, the, proposal, two, years, later, in, paris, listing, the, stone, as, one, of, several, key, items, belonging, to, egypt, s, cultural, heritage, a, list, which, also, included, the, iconic, bust, of, nefertiti, in, the, egyptian, museum, of, berlin, a, statue, of, the, great, pyramid, architect, hemiunu, in, the, roemer, und, pelizaeus, museum, in, hildesheim, germany, the, dendera, temple, zodiac, in, the, louvre, in, paris, and, the, bust, of, ankhhaf, in, the, museum, of, fine, arts, in, boston, in, august, 2022, zahi, hawass, reiterated, his, previous, demands, in, 2005, the, british, museum, presented, egypt, with, a, full, sized, fibreglass, colour, matched, replica, of, the, stele, this, was, initially, displayed, in, the, renovated, rashid, national, museum, an, ottoman, house, in, the, town, of, rashid, rosetta, the, closest, city, to, the, site, where, the, stone, was, found, in, november, 2005, hawass, suggested, a, three, month, loan, of, the, rosetta, stone, while, reiterating, the, eventual, goal, of, a, permanent, return, in, december, 2009, he, proposed, to, drop, his, claim, for, the, permanent, return, of, the, rosetta, stone, if, the, british, museum, lent, the, stone, to, egypt, for, three, months, for, the, opening, of, the, grand, egyptian, museum, at, giza, in, 2013, as, john, ray, has, observed, the, day, may, come, when, the, stone, has, spent, longer, in, the, british, museum, than, it, ever, did, in, rosetta, national, museums, typically, express, strong, opposition, to, the, repatriation, of, objects, of, international, cultural, significance, such, as, the, rosetta, stone, in, response, to, repeated, greek, requests, for, return, of, the, elgin, marbles, from, the, parthenon, and, similar, requests, to, other, museums, around, the, world, in, 2002, over, 30, of, the, world, s, leading, museums, including, the, british, museum, the, louvre, the, pergamon, museum, in, berlin, and, the, metropolitan, museum, in, new, york, city, issued, a, joint, statement, objects, acquired, in, earlier, times, must, be, viewed, in, the, light, of, different, sensitivities, and, values, reflective, of, that, earlier, era, museums, serve, not, just, the, citizens, of, one, nation, but, the, people, of, every, nation, various, ancient, bilingual, or, even, trilingual, epigraphical, documents, have, sometimes, been, described, as, rosetta, stones, as, they, permitted, the, decipherment, of, ancient, written, scripts, for, example, the, bilingual, greek, brahmi, coins, of, the, greco, bactrian, king, agathocles, have, been, described, as, little, rosetta, stones, allowing, christian, lassen, s, initial, progress, towards, deciphering, the, brahmi, script, thus, unlocking, ancient, indian, epigraphy, the, behistun, inscription, has, also, been, compared, to, the, rosetta, stone, as, it, links, the, translations, of, three, ancient, middle, eastern, languages, old, persian, elamite, and, akkadian, the, term, rosetta, stone, has, been, also, used, idiomatically, to, denote, the, first, crucial, key, in, the, process, of, decryption, of, encoded, information, especially, when, a, small, but, representative, sample, is, recognised, as, the, clue, to, understanding, a, larger, whole, according, to, the, oxford, english, dictionary, the, first, figurative, use, of, the, term, appeared, in, the, 1902, edition, of, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, relating, to, an, entry, on, the, chemical, analysis, of, glucose, another, use, of, the, phrase, is, found, in, h, g, wells, s, 1933, novel, the, shape, of, things, to, come, where, the, protagonist, finds, a, manuscript, written, in, shorthand, that, provides, a, key, to, understanding, additional, scattered, material, that, is, sketched, out, in, both, longhand, and, on, typewriter, since, then, the, term, has, been, widely, used, in, other, contexts, for, example, nobel, laureate, theodor, w, h, nsch, in, a, 1979, scientific, american, article, on, spectroscopy, wrote, that, the, spectrum, of, the, hydrogen, atoms, has, proven, to, be, the, rosetta, stone, of, modern, physics, once, this, pattern, of, lines, had, been, deciphered, much, else, could, also, be, understood, fully, understanding, the, key, set, of,
