trench, warfare, is, a, type, of, land, warfare, using, occupied, lines, largely, comprising, military, trenches, in, which, combatants, are, well, protected, from, the, enemy, s, small, arms, fire, and, are, substantially, sheltered, from, artillery, it, became, archetypically, associated, with, world, war, i, 1914, 1918, when, the, race, to, the, sea, rapidly, expanded, trench, use, on, the, western, front, starting, in, september, 1914, trench, warfare, proliferated, when, a, revolution, in, firepower, was, not, matched, by, similar, advances, in, mobility, resulting, in, a, grueling, form, of, warfare, in, which, the, defender, held, the, advantage, on, the, western, front, in, 1914, 1918, both, sides, constructed, elaborate, trench, underground, and, dugout, systems, opposing, each, other, along, a, front, protected, from, assault, by, barbed, wire, the, area, between, opposing, trench, lines, known, as, no, man, s, land, was, fully, exposed, to, artillery, fire, from, both, sides, attacks, even, if, successful, often, sustained, severe, casualties, the, development, of, armoured, warfare, and, combined, arms, tactics, permitted, static, lines, to, be, bypassed, and, defeated, leading, to, the, decline, of, trench, warfare, after, the, war, following, world, war, i, trench, warfare, became, a, byword, for, stalemate, attrition, sieges, and, futility, in, conflict, field, works, have, existed, for, as, long, as, there, have, been, armies, roman, legions, when, in, the, presence, of, an, enemy, entrenched, camps, nightly, when, on, the, move, the, roman, general, belisarius, had, his, soldiers, dig, a, trench, as, part, of, the, battle, of, dara, in, 530, ad, trench, warfare, was, also, documented, during, the, defence, of, medina, in, a, siege, known, as, the, battle, of, the, trench, 627, ad, the, architect, of, the, plan, was, salman, the, persian, who, suggested, digging, a, trench, to, defend, medina, there, are, examples, of, trench, digging, as, a, defensive, measure, during, the, middle, ages, in, europe, such, as, during, the, piedmontese, civil, war, where, it, was, documented, that, on, the, morning, of, may, 12, 1640, the, french, soldiers, having, already, captured, the, left, bank, of, the, po, river, and, gaining, control, of, the, bridge, connecting, the, two, banks, of, the, river, and, wanting, to, advance, to, the, capuchin, monastery, of, the, monte, deciding, that, their, position, wasn, t, secure, enough, for, their, liking, then, choose, to, advance, on, a, double, attack, on, the, trenches, but, were, twice, repelled, eventually, on, the, third, attempt, the, french, broke, through, and, the, defenders, were, forced, to, flee, with, the, civilian, population, seeking, the, sanctuary, of, the, local, catholic, church, the, santa, maria, al, monte, dei, cappuccini, in, turin, also, known, at, that, time, as, the, capuchin, monastery, of, the, monte, in, early, modern, warfare, troops, used, field, works, to, block, possible, lines, of, advance, examples, include, the, lines, of, stollhofen, built, at, the, start, of, the, war, of, the, spanish, succession, of, 1702, 1714, the, lines, of, weissenburg, built, under, the, orders, of, the, duke, of, villars, in, 1706, the, lines, of, ne, plus, ultra, during, the, winter, of, 1710, 1711, and, the, lines, of, torres, vedras, in, 1809, and, 1810, in, the, new, zealand, wars, 1845, 1872, the, m, ori, developed, elaborate, trench, and, bunker, systems, as, part, of, fortified, areas, known, as, p, employing, them, successfully, as, early, as, the, 1840s, to, withstand, british, artillery, bombardments, according, to, one, british, observer, the, fence, round, the, pa, is, covered, between, every, paling, with, loose, bunches, of, flax, against, which, the, bullets, fall, and, drop, in, the, night, they, repair, every, hole, made, by, the, guns, these, systems, included, firing, trenches, communication, trenches, tunnels, and, anti, artillery, bunkers, the, ng, puhi, p, ruapekapeka, is, often, considered, to, be, the, most, sophisticated, and, technologically, impressive, by, historians, british, casualties, such, as, at, gate, pa, in, 1864, and, the, battle, of, ohaeawai, in, 1845, suggested, that, contemporary, weaponry, such, as, muskets, and, cannon, proved, insufficient, to, dislodge, defenders, from, a, trench, system, there, has, been, an, academic, debate, surrounding, this, since, the, 1980s, when, in, his, book, the, new, zealand, wars, historian, james, belich, claimed, that, northern, m, ori, had, effectively, invented, trench, warfare, during, the, first, stages, of, the, new, zealand, wars, however, this, has, been, criticised, by, a, few, academics, of, the, same, period, with, gavin, mclean, noting, that, while, the, m, ori, had, certainly, adapted, pa, to, suit, contemporary, weaponry, many, historians, have, dismissed, belich, s, claim, as, baseless, revisionism, others, more, recently, have, said, that, while, it, is, clear, the, m, ori, did, not, invent, trench, warfare, first, m, ori, did, invent, trench, based, defences, without, any, offshore, aid, some, believe, they, may, have, influenced, 20th, century, methods, of, trench, design, identified, with, it, the, crimean, war, 1853, 1856, saw, massive, trench, works, and, trench, warfare, even, though, the, modernity, of, the, trench, war, was, not, immediately, apparent, to, the, contemporaries, union, and, confederate, armies, employed, field, works, and, extensive, trench, systems, in, the, american, civil, war, 1861, 1865, most, notably, in, the, sieges, of, vicksburg, 1863, and, petersburg, 1864, 1865, the, latter, of, which, saw, the, first, use, by, the, union, army, of, the, rapid, fire, gatling, gun, the, important, precursor, to, modern, day, machine, guns, trenches, were, also, utilized, in, the, paraguayan, war, which, started, in, 1864, the, second, anglo, boer, war, 1899, 1902, and, the, russo, japanese, war, 1904, 1905, although, technology, had, dramatically, changed, the, nature, of, warfare, by, 1914, the, armies, of, the, major, combatants, had, not, fully, absorbed, the, implications, fundamentally, as, the, range, and, rate, of, fire, of, rifled, small, arms, increased, a, defender, shielded, from, enemy, fire, in, a, trench, at, a, house, window, behind, a, large, rock, or, behind, other, cover, was, often, able, to, kill, several, approaching, foes, before, they, closed, around, the, defender, s, position, attacks, across, open, ground, became, even, more, dangerous, after, the, introduction, of, rapid, firing, artillery, exemplified, by, the, french, 75, and, high, explosive, fragmentation, rounds, the, increases, in, firepower, had, outstripped, the, ability, of, infantry, or, even, cavalry, to, cover, the, ground, between, firing, lines, and, the, ability, of, armour, to, withstand, fire, it, would, take, a, revolution, in, mobility, to, change, that, the, french, and, german, armies, adopted, different, tactical, doctrines, the, french, relied, on, the, attack, with, speed, and, surprise, and, the, germans, relied, on, firepower, investing, heavily, in, howitzers, and, machine, guns, the, british, lacked, an, official, tactical, doctrine, with, an, officer, corps, that, rejected, theory, in, favour, of, pragmatism, while, the, armies, expected, to, use, entrenchments, and, cover, they, did, not, allow, for, the, effect, of, defences, in, depth, they, required, a, deliberate, approach, to, seizing, positions, from, which, fire, support, could, be, given, for, the, next, phase, of, the, attack, rather, than, a, rapid, move, to, break, the, enemy, s, line, it, was, assumed, that, artillery, could, still, destroy, entrenched, troops, or, at, least, suppress, them, sufficiently, for, friendly, infantry, and, cavalry, to, manoeuvre, digging, in, when, defending, a, position, was, a, standard, practice, by, the, start, of, wwi, to, attack, frontally, was, to, court, crippling, losses, so, an, outflanking, operation, was, the, preferred, method, of, attack, against, an, entrenched, enemy, after, the, battle, of, the, aisne, in, september, 1914, an, extended, series, of, attempted, flanking, moves, and, matching, extensions, to, the, fortified, defensive, lines, developed, into, the, race, to, the, sea, by, the, end, of, which, german, and, allied, armies, had, produced, a, matched, pair, of, trench, lines, from, the, swiss, border, in, the, south, to, the, north, sea, coast, of, belgium, by, the, end, of, october, 1914, the, whole, front, in, belgium, and, france, had, solidified, into, lines, of, trenches, which, lasted, until, the, last, weeks, of, the, war, mass, infantry, assaults, were, futile, in, the, face, of, artillery, fire, as, well, as, rapid, rifle, and, machine, gun, fire, both, sides, concentrated, on, breaking, up, enemy, attacks, and, on, protecting, their, own, troops, by, digging, deep, into, the, ground, after, the, buildup, of, forces, in, 1915, the, western, front, became, a, stalemated, struggle, between, equals, to, be, decided, by, attrition, frontal, assaults, and, their, associated, casualties, became, inevitable, because, the, continuous, trench, lines, had, no, open, flanks, casualties, of, the, defenders, matched, those, of, the, attackers, as, vast, reserves, were, expended, in, costly, counter, attacks, or, exposed, to, the, attacker, s, massed, artillery, there, were, periods, in, which, rigid, trench, warfare, broke, down, such, as, during, the, battle, of, the, somme, but, the, lines, never, moved, very, far, the, war, would, be, won, by, the, side, that, was, able, to, commit, the, last, reserves, to, the, western, front, trench, warfare, prevailed, on, the, western, front, until, the, germans, launched, their, spring, offensive, on, 21, march, 1918, trench, warfare, also, took, place, on, other, fronts, including, in, italy, and, at, gallipoli, armies, were, also, limited, by, logistics, the, heavy, use, of, artillery, meant, that, ammunition, expenditure, was, far, higher, in, wwi, than, in, any, previous, conflict, horses, and, carts, were, insufficient, for, transporting, large, quantities, over, long, distances, so, armies, had, trouble, moving, far, from, railheads, this, greatly, slowed, advances, making, it, impossible, for, either, side, to, achieve, a, breakthrough, that, would, change, the, war, this, situation, would, only, be, altered, in, wwii, with, greater, use, of, motorized, vehicles, trenches, were, longer, deeper, and, better, defended, by, steel, concrete, and, barbed, wire, than, ever, before, they, were, far, stronger, and, more, effective, than, chains, of, forts, for, they, formed, a, continuous, network, sometimes, with, four, or, five, parallel, lines, linked, by, interfacings, they, were, dug, far, below, the, surface, of, the, earth, out, of, reach, of, the, heaviest, artillery, grand, battles, with, the, old, maneuvers, were, out, of, the, question, only, by, bombardment, sapping, and, assault, could, the, enemy, be, shaken, and, such, operations, had, to, be, conducted, on, an, immense, scale, to, produce, appreciable, results, indeed, it, is, questionable, whether, the, german, lines, in, france, could, ever, have, been, broken, if, the, germans, had, not, wasted, their, resources, in, unsuccessful, assaults, and, the, blockade, by, sea, had, not, gradually, cut, off, their, supplies, in, such, warfare, no, single, general, could, strike, a, blow, that, would, make, him, immortal, the, glory, of, fighting, sank, down, into, the, dirt, and, mire, of, trenches, and, dugouts, early, world, war, i, trenches, were, simple, they, lacked, traverses, and, according, to, pre, war, doctrine, were, to, be, packed, with, men, fighting, shoulder, to, shoulder, this, doctrine, led, to, heavy, casualties, from, artillery, fire, this, vulnerability, and, the, length, of, the, front, to, be, defended, soon, led, to, frontline, trenches, being, held, by, fewer, men, the, defenders, augmented, the, trenches, themselves, with, barbed, wire, strung, in, front, to, impede, movement, wiring, parties, went, out, every, night, to, repair, and, improve, these, forward, defences, the, small, improvised, trenches, of, the, first, few, months, grew, deeper, and, more, complex, gradually, becoming, vast, areas, of, interlocking, defensive, works, they, resisted, both, artillery, bombardment, and, mass, infantry, assault, shell, proof, dugouts, became, a, high, priority, a, well, developed, trench, had, to, be, at, least, 2, 5, m, 8, ft, deep, to, allow, men, to, walk, upright, and, still, be, protected, there, were, three, standard, ways, to, dig, a, trench, entrenching, sapping, and, tunneling, entrenching, where, a, man, would, stand, on, the, surface, and, dig, downwards, was, most, efficient, as, it, allowed, a, large, digging, party, to, dig, the, full, length, of, the, trench, simultaneously, however, entrenching, left, the, diggers, exposed, above, ground, and, hence, could, only, be, carried, out, when, free, of, observation, such, as, in, a, rear, area, or, at, night, sapping, involved, extending, the, trench, by, digging, away, at, the, end, face, the, diggers, were, not, exposed, but, only, one, or, two, men, could, work, on, the, trench, at, a, time, tunnelling, was, like, sapping, except, that, a, roof, of, soil, was, left, in, place, while, the, trench, line, was, established, and, then, removed, when, the, trench, was, ready, to, be, occupied, the, guidelines, for, british, trench, construction, stated, that, it, would, take, 450, men, 6, hours, at, night, to, complete, 250, m, 270, yd, of, front, line, trench, system, thereafter, the, trench, would, require, constant, maintenance, to, prevent, deterioration, caused, by, weather, or, shelling, trenchmen, were, a, specialized, unit, of, trench, excavators, and, repairmen, they, usually, dug, or, repaired, in, groups, of, four, with, an, escort, of, two, armed, soldiers, trenchmen, were, armed, with, one, 1911, semi, automatic, pistol, and, were, only, utilized, when, either, a, new, trench, needed, to, be, dug, or, expanded, quickly, or, when, a, trench, was, destroyed, by, artillery, fire, trenchmen, were, trained, to, dig, with, incredible, speed, in, a, dig, of, three, to, six, hours, they, could, accomplish, what, would, take, a, normal, group, of, frontline, infantry, soldiers, around, two, days, trenchmen, were, usually, looked, down, upon, by, fellow, soldiers, because, they, did, not, fight, they, were, usually, called, cowards, because, if, they, were, attacked, while, digging, they, would, abandon, the, post, and, flee, to, safety, they, were, instructed, to, do, this, though, because, through, the, war, there, were, only, around, 1, 100, trained, trenchmen, they, were, highly, valued, only, by, officers, higher, on, the, chain, of, command, the, banked, earth, on, the, lip, of, the, trench, facing, the, enemy, was, called, the, parapet, and, had, a, fire, step, the, embanked, rear, lip, of, the, trench, was, called, the, parados, which, protected, the, soldier, s, back, from, shells, falling, behind, the, trench, the, sides, of, the, trench, were, often, revetted, with, sandbags, wire, mesh, wooden, frames, and, sometimes, roofs, the, floor, of, the, trench, was, usually, covered, by, wooden, duckboards, in, later, designs, the, floor, might, be, raised, on, a, wooden, frame, to, provide, a, drainage, channel, underneath, due, to, the, substantial, casualties, taken, from, indirect, fire, some, trenches, were, reinforced, with, corrugated, metal, roofs, over, the, top, as, an, improvised, defence, from, shrapnel, the, static, movement, of, trench, warfare, and, a, need, for, protection, from, snipers, created, a, requirement, for, loopholes, both, for, discharging, firearms, and, for, observation, often, a, steel, plate, was, used, with, a, keyhole, which, had, a, rotating, piece, to, cover, the, loophole, when, not, in, use, german, snipers, used, armour, piercing, bullets, that, allowed, them, to, penetrate, loopholes, another, means, to, see, over, the, parapet, was, the, trench, periscope, in, its, simplest, form, just, a, stick, with, two, angled, pieces, of, mirror, at, the, top, and, bottom, a, number, of, armies, made, use, of, the, periscope, rifle, which, enabled, soldiers, to, snipe, at, the, enemy, without, exposing, themselves, over, the, parapet, although, at, the, cost, of, reduced, shooting, accuracy, the, device, is, most, associated, with, australian, and, new, zealand, troops, at, gallipoli, where, the, turks, held, the, high, ground, dugouts, of, varying, degrees, of, comfort, were, built, in, the, rear, of, the, support, trench, british, dugouts, were, usually, 2, 5, to, 5, m, 8, to, 16, ft, deep, the, germans, who, had, based, their, knowledge, on, studies, of, the, russo, japanese, war, made, something, of, a, science, out, of, designing, and, constructing, defensive, works, they, used, reinforced, concrete, to, construct, deep, shell, proof, ventilated, dugouts, as, well, as, strategic, strongpoints, german, dugouts, were, typically, much, deeper, usually, a, minimum, of, 4, m, 12, ft, deep, and, sometimes, dug, three, stories, down, with, concrete, staircases, to, reach, the, upper, levels, trenches, were, never, straight, but, were, dug, in, a, zigzagging, or, stepped, pattern, with, all, straight, sections, generally, kept, less, than, a, dozen, metres, later, this, evolved, to, have, the, combat, trenches, broken, into, distinct, fire, bays, connected, by, traverses, while, this, isolated, the, view, of, friendly, soldiers, along, their, own, trench, this, ensured, the, entire, trench, could, not, be, enfiladed, if, the, enemy, gained, access, at, any, one, point, or, if, a, bomb, grenade, or, shell, landed, in, the, trench, the, blast, could, not, travel, far, very, early, in, the, war, british, defensive, doctrine, suggested, a, main, trench, system, of, three, parallel, lines, interconnected, by, communications, trenches, the, point, at, which, a, communications, trench, intersected, the, front, trench, was, of, critical, importance, and, it, was, usually, heavily, fortified, the, front, trench, was, lightly, garrisoned, and, typically, occupied, in, force, only, during, stand, to, at, dawn, and, dusk, between, 65, and, 90, m, 70, and, 100, yd, behind, the, front, trench, was, located, the, support, or, travel, trench, to, which, the, garrison, would, retreat, when, the, front, trench, was, bombarded, between, 90, and, 270, metres, 100, and, 300, yd, further, to, the, rear, was, located, the, third, reserve, trench, where, the, reserve, troops, could, amass, for, a, counter, attack, if, the, front, trenches, were, captured, this, defensive, layout, was, soon, rendered, obsolete, as, the, power, of, artillery, grew, however, in, certain, sectors, of, the, front, the, support, trench, was, maintained, as, a, decoy, to, attract, the, enemy, bombardment, away, from, the, front, and, reserve, lines, fires, were, lit, in, the, support, line, to, make, it, appear, inhabited, and, any, damage, done, immediately, repaired, temporary, trenches, were, also, built, when, a, major, attack, was, planned, assembly, trenches, would, be, dug, near, the, front, trench, these, were, used, to, provide, a, sheltered, place, for, the, waves, of, attacking, troops, who, would, follow, the, first, waves, leaving, from, the, front, trench, saps, were, temporary, unmanned, often, dead, end, utility, trenches, dug, out, into, no, man, s, land, they, fulfilled, a, variety, of, purposes, such, as, connecting, the, front, trench, to, a, listening, post, close, to, the, enemy, wire, or, providing, an, advance, jumping, off, line, for, a, surprise, attack, when, one, side, s, front, line, bulged, towards, the, opposition, a, salient, was, formed, the, concave, trench, line, facing, the, salient, was, called, a, re, entrant, large, salients, were, perilous, for, their, occupants, because, they, could, be, assailed, from, three, sides, behind, the, front, system, of, trenches, there, were, usually, at, least, two, more, partially, prepared, trench, systems, kilometres, to, the, rear, ready, to, be, occupied, in, the, event, of, a, retreat, the, germans, often, prepared, multiple, redundant, trench, systems, in, 1916, their, somme, front, featured, two, complete, trench, systems, one, kilometre, apart, with, a, third, partially, completed, system, a, further, kilometre, behind, this, duplication, made, a, decisive, breakthrough, virtually, impossible, in, the, event, that, a, section, of, the, first, trench, system, was, captured, a, switch, trench, would, be, dug, to, connect, the, second, trench, system, to, the, still, held, section, of, the, first, the, use, of, lines, of, barbed, wire, razor, wire, and, other, wire, obstacles, in, belts, 15, m, 49, ft, deep, or, more, is, effective, in, stalling, infantry, travelling, across, the, battlefield, although, the, barbs, or, razors, might, cause, minor, injuries, the, purpose, was, to, entangle, the, limbs, of, enemy, soldiers, forcing, them, to, stop, and, methodically, pull, or, work, the, wire, off, likely, taking, several, seconds, or, even, longer, this, is, deadly, when, the, wire, is, emplaced, at, points, of, maximum, exposure, to, concentrated, enemy, firepower, in, plain, sight, of, enemy, fire, bays, and, machine, guns, the, combination, of, wire, and, firepower, was, the, cause, of, most, failed, attacks, in, trench, warfare, and, their, very, high, casualties, liddell, hart, identified, barbed, wire, and, the, machine, gun, as, the, elements, that, had, to, be, broken, to, regain, a, mobile, battlefield, a, basic, wire, line, could, be, created, by, draping, several, strands, of, barbed, wire, between, wooden, posts, driven, into, the, ground, loose, lines, of, wire, can, be, more, effective, in, entangling, than, tight, ones, and, it, was, common, to, use, the, coils, of, barbed, wire, as, delivered, only, partially, stretched, out, called, concertina, wire, placing, and, repairing, wire, in, no, man, s, land, relied, on, stealth, usually, done, at, night, by, special, wiring, parties, who, could, also, be, tasked, with, secretly, sabotaging, enemy, wires, the, screw, picket, invented, by, the, germans, and, later, adopted, by, the, allies, during, the, war, was, quieter, than, driving, stakes, wire, often, stretched, the, entire, length, of, a, battlefield, s, trench, line, in, multiple, lines, sometimes, covering, a, depth, 30, metres, 100, ft, or, more, methods, to, defeat, it, were, rudimentary, prolonged, artillery, bombardment, could, damage, them, but, not, reliably, the, first, soldier, meeting, the, wire, could, jump, onto, the, top, of, it, hopefully, depressing, it, enough, for, those, that, followed, to, get, over, him, this, still, took, at, least, one, soldier, out, of, action, for, each, line, of, wire, in, world, war, i, british, and, commonwealth, forces, relied, on, wire, cutters, which, proved, unable, to, cope, with, the, heavier, gauge, german, wire, the, bangalore, torpedo, was, adopted, by, many, armies, and, continued, in, use, past, the, end, of, world, war, ii, the, barbed, wire, used, differed, between, nations, the, german, wire, was, heavier, gauge, and, british, wire, cutters, designed, for, the, thinner, native, product, were, unable, to, cut, it, the, confined, static, and, subterranean, nature, of, trench, warfare, resulted, in, it, developing, its, own, peculiar, form, of, geography, in, the, forward, zone, the, conventional, transport, infrastructure, of, roads, and, rail, were, replaced, by, the, network, of, trenches, and, trench, railways, the, critical, advantage, that, could, be, gained, by, holding, the, high, ground, meant, that, minor, hills, and, ridges, gained, enormous, significance, many, slight, hills, and, valleys, were, so, subtle, as, to, have, been, nameless, until, the, front, line, encroached, upon, them, some, hills, were, named, for, their, height, in, metres, such, as, hill, 60, a, farmhouse, windmill, quarry, or, copse, of, trees, would, become, the, focus, of, a, determined, struggle, simply, because, it, was, the, largest, identifiable, feature, however, it, would, not, take, the, artillery, long, to, obliterate, it, so, that, thereafter, it, became, just, a, name, on, a, map, the, battlefield, of, flanders, presented, numerous, problems, for, the, practice, of, trench, warfare, especially, for, the, allied, forces, mainly, british, and, canadians, who, were, often, compelled, to, occupy, the, low, ground, heavy, shelling, quickly, destroyed, the, network, of, ditches, and, water, channels, which, had, previously, drained, this, low, lying, area, of, belgium, in, most, places, the, water, table, was, only, a, metre, or, so, below, the, surface, meaning, that, any, trench, dug, in, the, ground, would, quickly, flood, consequently, many, trenches, in, flanders, were, actually, above, ground, and, constructed, from, massive, breastworks, of, sandbags, filled, with, clay, initially, both, the, parapet, and, parados, of, the, trench, were, built, in, this, way, but, a, later, technique, was, to, dispense, with, the, parados, for, much, of, the, trench, line, thus, exposing, the, rear, of, the, trench, to, fire, from, the, reserve, line, in, case, the, front, was, breached, in, the, alps, trench, warfare, even, stretched, onto, vertical, slopes, and, deep, into, the, mountains, to, heights, of, 3, 900, m, 12, 800, ft, above, sea, level, the, ortler, had, an, artillery, position, on, its, summit, near, the, front, line, the, trench, line, management, and, trench, profiles, had, to, be, adapted, to, the, rough, terrain, hard, rock, and, harsh, weather, conditions, many, trench, systems, were, constructed, within, glaciers, such, as, the, adamello, presanella, group, or, the, famous, city, below, the, ice, on, the, marmolada, in, the, dolomites, observing, the, enemy, in, trench, warfare, was, difficult, prompting, the, invention, of, technology, such, as, the, camouflage, tree, the, space, between, the, opposing, trenches, was, referred, to, as, no, man, s, land, and, varied, in, width, depending, on, the, battlefield, on, the, western, front, it, was, typically, between, 90, and, 275, metres, 100, and, 300, yd, though, only, 25, metres, 30, yd, on, vimy, ridge, after, the, german, withdrawal, to, the, hindenburg, line, in, march, 1917, no, man, s, land, stretched, to, over, a, kilometre, in, places, at, the, quinn, s, post, in, the, cramped, confines, of, the, anzac, battlefield, at, gallipoli, the, opposing, trenches, were, only, 15, metres, 16, yd, apart, and, the, soldiers, in, the, trenches, constantly, threw, hand, grenades, at, each, other, on, the, eastern, front, and, in, the, middle, east, the, areas, to, be, covered, were, so, vast, and, the, distances, from, the, factories, supplying, shells, bullets, concrete, and, barbed, wire, so, great, trench, warfare, in, the, west, european, style, often, did, not, occur, at, the, start, of, the, first, world, war, the, standard, infantry, soldier, s, primary, weapons, were, the, rifle, and, bayonet, other, weapons, got, less, attention, especially, for, the, british, what, hand, grenades, were, issued, tended, to, be, few, in, numbers, and, less, effective, this, emphasis, began, to, shift, as, soon, as, trench, warfare, began, militaries, rushed, improved, grenades, into, mass, production, including, rifle, grenades, the, hand, grenade, came, to, be, one, of, the, primary, infantry, weapons, of, trench, warfare, both, sides, were, quick, to, raise, specialist, grenadier, groups, the, grenade, enabled, a, soldier, to, engage, the, enemy, without, exposing, himself, to, fire, and, it, did, not, require, precise, accuracy, to, kill, or, maim, another, benefit, was, that, if, a, soldier, could, get, close, enough, to, the, trenches, enemies, hiding, in, trenches, could, be, attacked, the, germans, and, turks, were, well, equipped, with, grenades, from, the, start, of, the, war, but, the, british, who, had, ceased, using, grenadiers, in, the, 1870s, and, did, not, anticipate, a, siege, war, entered, the, conflict, with, virtually, none, so, soldiers, had, to, improvise, bombs, with, whatever, was, available, see, jam, tin, grenade, by, late, 1915, the, british, mills, bomb, had, entered, wide, circulation, and, by, the, end, of, the, war, 75, million, had, been, used, since, the, troops, were, often, not, adequately, equipped, for, trench, warfare, improvised, weapons, were, common, in, the, first, encounters, such, as, short, wooden, clubs, and, metal, maces, spears, hatchets, hammers, entrenching, tools, as, well, as, trench, knives, and, brass, knuckles, according, to, the, semi, biographical, war, novel, all, quiet, on, the, western, front, many, soldiers, preferred, to, use, a, sharpened, spade, as, an, improvised, melee, weapon, instead, of, the, bayonet, as, the, bayonet, tended, to, get, stuck, in, stabbed, opponents, rendering, it, useless, in, heated, battle, the, shorter, length, also, made, them, easier, to, use, in, the, confined, quarters, of, the, trenches, these, tools, could, then, be, used, to, dig, in, after, they, had, taken, a, trench, modern, military, digging, tools, are, as, a, rule, designed, to, also, function, as, a, melee, weapon, as, the, war, progressed, better, equipment, was, issued, and, improvised, arms, were, discarded, a, specialised, group, of, fighters, called, trench, sweepers, nettoyeurs, de, tranch, es, or, zigouilleurs, evolved, to, fight, within, the, trenches, they, cleared, surviving, enemy, personnel, from, recently, overrun, trenches, and, made, clandestine, raids, into, enemy, trenches, to, gather, intelligence, volunteers, for, this, dangerous, work, were, often, exempted, from, participation, in, frontal, assaults, over, open, ground, and, from, routine, work, like, filling, sandbags, draining, trenches, and, repairing, barbed, wire, in, no, man, s, land, when, allowed, to, choose, their, own, weapons, many, selected, grenades, knives, and, pistols, fn, m1900, pistols, were, highly, regarded, for, this, work, but, never, available, in, adequate, quantities, colt, model, 1903, pocket, hammerless, savage, model, 1907, star, bonifacio, echeverria, and, ruby, pistols, were, widely, used, various, mechanical, devices, were, invented, for, throwing, hand, grenades, into, enemy, trenches, the, germans, used, the, wurfmaschine, a, spring, powered, device, for, throwing, a, hand, grenade, about, 200, m, 220, yd, the, french, responded, with, the, sauterelle, and, the, british, with, the, leach, trench, catapult, and, west, spring, gun, which, had, varying, degrees, of, success, and, accuracy, by, 1916, catapult, weapons, were, largely, replaced, by, rifle, grenades, and, mortars, the, germans, employed, flammenwerfer, flamethrowers, during, the, war, for, the, first, time, against, the, french, on, 25, june, 1915, then, against, the, british, 30, july, in, hooge, the, technology, was, in, its, infancy, and, use, was, not, very, common, until, the, end, of, 1917, when, portability, and, reliability, were, improved, it, was, used, in, more, than, 300, documented, battles, by, 1918, it, became, a, weapon, of, choice, for, sto, truppen, stormtroopers, with, a, team, of, six, pioniere, combat, engineers, per, squad, used, by, american, soldiers, in, the, western, front, the, pump, action, shotguns, was, a, formidable, weapon, in, short, range, combat, enough, so, that, germany, lodged, a, formal, protest, against, their, use, on, 14, september, 1918, stating, every, prisoner, found, to, have, in, his, possession, such, guns, or, ammunition, belonging, thereto, forfeits, his, life, though, this, threat, was, apparently, never, carried, out, the, u, s, military, began, to, issue, models, specially, modified, for, combat, called, trench, guns, with, shorter, barrels, higher, capacity, magazines, no, choke, and, often, heat, shields, around, the, barrel, as, well, as, lugs, for, the, m1917, bayonet, anzac, and, some, british, soldiers, were, also, known, to, use, sawn, off, shotguns, in, trench, raids, because, of, their, portability, effectiveness, at, close, range, and, ease, of, use, in, the, confines, of, a, trench, this, practice, was, not, officially, sanctioned, and, the, shotguns, used, were, invariably, modified, sporting, guns, the, germans, embraced, the, machine, gun, from, the, outset, in, 1904, sixteen, units, were, equipped, with, the, maschinengewehr, and, the, machine, gun, crews, were, the, elite, infantry, units, these, units, were, attached, to, jaeger, light, infantry, battalions, by, 1914, british, infantry, units, were, armed, with, two, vickers, machine, guns, per, battalion, the, germans, had, six, per, battalion, and, the, russians, eight, it, would, not, be, until, 1917, that, every, infantry, unit, of, the, american, forces, carried, at, least, one, machine, gun, after, 1915, the, maschinengewehr, 08, was, the, standard, issue, german, machine, gun, its, number, 08, 15, entered, the, german, language, as, idiomatic, for, dead, plain, at, gallipoli, and, in, palestine, the, turks, provided, the, infantry, but, it, was, usually, germans, who, manned, the, machine, guns, the, british, high, command, were, less, enthusiastic, about, machine, guns, supposedly, considering, the, weapon, too, unsporting, and, encouraging, defensive, fighting, and, they, lagged, behind, the, germans, in, adopting, it, field, marshal, sir, douglas, haig, is, quoted, as, saying, in, 1915, the, machine, gun, is, a, much, overrated, weapon, two, per, battalion, is, more, than, sufficient, the, defensive, firepower, of, the, machine, gun, was, exemplified, during, the, first, day, of, the, battle, of, the, somme, when, 60, 000, british, soldiers, were, rendered, casualties, the, great, majority, lost, under, withering, machine, gun, fire, in, 1915, the, machine, gun, corps, was, formed, to, train, and, provide, sufficient, heavy, machine, gun, teams, it, was, the, canadians, that, made, the, best, practice, pioneering, area, denial, and, indirect, fire, soon, adopted, by, all, allied, armies, under, the, guidance, of, former, french, army, reserve, officer, major, general, raymond, brutinel, minutes, before, the, attack, on, vimy, ridge, the, canadians, thickened, the, artillery, barrage, by, aiming, machine, guns, indirectly, to, deliver, plunging, fire, on, the, germans, they, also, significantly, increased, the, number, of, machine, guns, per, battalion, to, match, demand, production, of, the, vickers, machine, gun, was, contracted, to, firms, in, the, united, states, by, 1917, every, company, in, the, british, forces, were, also, equipped, with, four, lewis, light, machine, guns, which, significantly, enhanced, their, firepower, the, heavy, machine, gun, was, a, specialist, weapon, and, in, a, static, trench, system, was, employed, in, a, scientific, manner, with, carefully, calculated, fields, of, fire, so, that, at, a, moment, s, notice, an, accurate, burst, could, be, fired, at, the, enemy, s, parapet, or, a, break, in, the, wire, equally, it, could, be, used, as, light, artillery, in, bombarding, distant, trenches, heavy, machine, guns, required, teams, of, up, to, eight, men, to, move, them, maintain, them, and, keep, them, supplied, with, ammunition, this, made, them, impractical, for, offensive, manoeuvres, contributing, to, the, stalemate, on, the, western, front, one, machine, gun, nest, was, theoretically, able, to, mow, down, hundreds, of, enemies, charging, in, the, open, through, no, man, s, land, however, while, wwi, machine, guns, were, able, to, shoot, hundreds, of, rounds, per, minute, in, theory, they, were, still, prone, to, overheating, and, jamming, which, often, necessitated, firing, in, short, bursts, however, their, potential, was, increased, significantly, when, emplaced, behind, multiple, lines, of, barbed, wire, to, slow, any, advancing, enemy, in, 1917, and, 1918, new, types, of, weapons, were, fielded, they, changed, the, face, of, warfare, tactics, and, were, later, employed, during, world, war, ii, the, french, introduced, the, csrg, 1915, chauchat, during, spring, 1916, around, the, concept, of, walking, fire, employed, in, 1918, when, 250, 000, weapons, were, fielded, more, than, 80, 000, of, the, best, shooters, received, the, semi, automatic, rsc, 1917, rifle, allowing, them, to, rapid, fire, at, waves, of, attacking, soldiers, firing, ports, were, installed, in, the, newly, arrived, renault, ft, tanks, the, french, army, fielded, a, ground, version, of, the, hotchkiss, canon, de, 37, mm, used, by, the, french, navy, it, was, primarily, used, to, destroy, german, machine, gun, nests, and, concrete, reinforced, pillboxes, with, high, explosive, and, armour, piercing, rounds, a, new, type, of, machine, gun, was, introduced, in, 1916, initially, an, aircraft, weapon, the, bergmann, lmg, 15, was, modified, for, ground, use, with, the, later, dedicated, ground, version, being, the, lmg, 15, n, a, it, was, used, as, an, infantry, weapon, on, all, european, and, middle, eastern, fronts, until, the, end, of, world, war, i, it, later, inspired, the, mg, 30, and, the, mg, 34, as, well, as, the, concept, of, the, general, purpose, machine, gun, what, became, known, as, the, submachine, gun, had, its, genesis, in, world, war, i, developed, around, the, concepts, of, infiltration, and, fire, and, movement, specifically, to, clear, trenches, of, enemy, soldiers, when, engagements, were, unlikely, to, occur, beyond, a, range, of, a, few, feet, the, mp, 18, was, the, first, practical, submachine, gun, used, in, combat, it, was, fielded, in, 1918, by, the, german, army, as, the, primary, weapon, of, the, stormtroopers, assault, groups, that, specialised, in, trench, combat, around, the, same, time, the, italians, had, developed, the, beretta, m1918, submachine, gun, based, on, a, design, from, earlier, in, the, war, artillery, dominated, the, battlefields, of, trench, warfare, an, infantry, attack, was, rarely, successful, if, it, advanced, beyond, the, range, of, its, supporting, artillery, in, addition, to, bombarding, the, enemy, infantry, in, the, trenches, the, artillery, could, be, used, to, precede, infantry, advances, with, a, creeping, barrage, or, engage, in, counter, battery, duels, to, try, to, destroy, the, enemy, s, guns, artillery, mainly, fired, fragmentation, high, explosive, shrapnel, or, later, in, the, war, gas, shells, the, british, experimented, with, firing, thermite, incendiary, shells, to, set, trees, and, ruins, alight, however, all, armies, experienced, shell, shortages, during, the, first, year, or, two, of, world, war, i, due, to, underestimating, their, usage, in, intensive, combat, this, knowledge, had, been, gained, by, the, combatant, nations, in, the, russo, japanese, war, when, daily, artillery, fire, consumed, ten, times, more, than, daily, factory, output, but, had, not, been, applied, artillery, pieces, were, of, two, types, infantry, support, guns, and, howitzers, guns, fired, high, velocity, shells, over, a, flat, trajectory, and, were, often, used, to, deliver, fragmentation, and, to, cut, barbed, wire, howitzers, lofted, the, shell, over, a, high, trajectory, so, it, plunged, into, the, ground, the, largest, calibers, were, usually, howitzers, the, german, 420, mm, 17, in, howitzer, weighed, 20, tons, and, could, fire, a, one, ton, shell, over, 10, km, 6, 2, mi, a, critical, feature, of, period, artillery, pieces, was, the, hydraulic, recoil, mechanism, which, meant, the, gun, did, not, need, to, be, re, aimed, after, each, shot, permitting, a, tremendous, increase, in, rate, of, fire, initially, each, gun, would, need, to, register, its, aim, on, a, known, target, in, view, of, an, observer, in, order, to, fire, with, precision, during, a, battle, the, process, of, gun, registration, would, often, alert, the, enemy, an, attack, was, being, planned, towards, the, end, of, 1917, artillery, techniques, were, developed, enabling, fire, to, be, delivered, accurately, without, registration, on, the, battlefield, the, gun, registration, was, done, behind, the, lines, then, the, pre, registered, guns, were, brought, up, to, the, front, for, a, surprise, attack, mortars, which, lobbed, a, shell, in, a, high, arc, over, a, relatively, short, distance, were, widely, used, in, trench, fighting, for, harassing, the, forward, trenches, for, cutting, wire, in, preparation, for, a, raid, or, attack, and, for, destroying, dugouts, saps, and, other, entrenchments, in, 1914, the, british, fired, a, total, of, 545, mortar, shells, in, 1916, they, fired, over, 6, 500, 000, similarly, howitzers, which, fire, on, a, more, direct, arc, than, mortars, raised, in, number, from, over, 1, 000, shells, in, 1914, to, over, 4, 500, 000, in, 1916, the, smaller, numerical, difference, in, mortar, rounds, as, opposed, to, howitzer, rounds, is, presumed, by, many, to, be, related, to, the, expanded, costs, of, manufacturing, the, larger, and, more, resource, intensive, howitzer, rounds, the, main, british, mortar, was, the, stokes, a, precursor, of, the, modern, mortar, it, was, a, light, mortar, simple, in, operation, and, capable, of, a, rapid, rate, of, fire, by, virtue, of, the, propellant, cartridge, being, attached, to, the, base, shell, to, fire, the, stokes, mortar, the, round, was, simply, dropped, into, the, tube, where, the, percussion, cartridge, was, detonated, when, it, struck, the, firing, pin, at, the, bottom, of, the, barrel, thus, being, launched, the, germans, used, a, range, of, mortars, the, smallest, were, grenade, throwers, granatenwerfer, which, fired, the, stick, grenades, which, were, commonly, used, their, medium, trench, mortars, were, called, mine, throwers, minenwerfer, the, heavy, mortar, was, called, the, ladungswerfer, which, threw, aerial, torpedoes, containing, a, 200, lb, 91, kg, charge, to, a, range, of, 1, 000, yd, 910, m, the, flight, of, the, missile, was, so, slow, and, leisurely, that, men, on, the, receiving, end, could, make, some, attempt, to, seek, shelter, mortars, had, certain, advantages, over, artillery, such, as, being, much, more, portable, and, the, ability, to, fire, without, leaving, the, relative, safety, of, trenches, moreover, mortars, were, able, to, fire, directly, into, the, trenches, which, was, hard, to, do, with, artillery, the, fundamental, strategy, of, trench, warfare, in, world, war, i, was, to, defend, one, s, own, position, strongly, while, trying, to, achieve, a, breakthrough, into, the, enemy, s, rear, the, effect, was, to, end, up, in, attrition, the, process, of, progressively, grinding, down, the, opposition, s, resources, until, ultimately, they, are, no, longer, able, to, wage, war, this, did, not, prevent, the, ambitious, commander, from, pursuing, the, strategy, of, annihilation, the, ideal, of, an, offensive, battle, which, produces, victory, in, one, decisive, engagement, the, commander, in, chief, of, the, british, forces, during, most, of, world, war, i, general, douglas, haig, was, constantly, seeking, a, breakthrough, which, could, then, be, exploited, with, cavalry, divisions, his, major, trench, offensives, the, somme, in, 1916, and, flanders, in, 1917, were, conceived, as, breakthrough, battles, but, both, degenerated, into, costly, attrition, the, germans, actively, pursued, a, strategy, of, attrition, in, the, battle, of, verdun, the, sole, purpose, of, which, was, to, bleed, the, french, army, white, at, the, same, time, the, allies, needed, to, mount, offensives, in, order, to, draw, attention, away, from, other, hard, pressed, areas, of, the, line, the, popular, image, of, a, trench, assault, is, of, a, wave, of, soldiers, bayonets, fixed, going, over, the, top, and, marching, in, a, line, across, no, man, s, land, into, a, hail, of, enemy, fire, this, was, the, standard, method, early, in, the, war, it, was, rarely, successful, more, common, was, an, attack, at, night, from, an, advanced, post, in, no, man, s, land, having, cut, the, barbed, wire, beforehand, in, 1915, the, germans, innovated, with, infiltration, tactics, where, small, groups, of, highly, trained, and, well, equipped, troops, would, attack, vulnerable, points, and, bypass, strong, points, driving, deep, into, the, rear, areas, the, distance, they, could, advance, was, still, limited, by, their, ability, to, supply, and, communicate, the, role, of, artillery, in, an, infantry, attack, was, twofold, the, first, aim, of, a, bombardment, was, to, prepare, the, ground, for, an, infantry, assault, killing, or, demoralising, the, enemy, garrison, and, destroying, their, defences, the, duration, of, these, initial, bombardments, varied, from, seconds, to, days, artillery, bombardments, prior, to, infantry, assaults, were, often, ineffective, at, destroying, enemy, defences, only, serving, to, provide, advance, notice, of, an, attack, the, british, bombardment, that, began, the, battle, of, the, somme, lasted, eight, days, but, did, little, damage, to, either, the, german, barbed, wire, or, their, deep, dug, outs, where, defenders, were, able, to, wait, out, the, bombardment, in, relative, safety, once, the, guns, stopped, the, defenders, had, time, to, emerge, and, were, usually, ready, for, the, attacking, infantry, the, second, aim, was, to, protect, the, attacking, infantry, by, providing, an, impenetrable, barrage, or, curtain, of, shells, to, prevent, an, enemy, counter, attack, the, first, attempt, at, sophistication, was, the, lifting, barrage, where, the, first, objective, of, an, attack, was, intensely, bombarded, for, a, period, before, the, entire, barrage, lifted, to, fall, on, a, second, objective, farther, back, however, this, usually, expected, too, much, of, the, infantry, and, the, usual, outcome, was, that, the, barrage, would, outpace, the, attackers, leaving, them, without, protection, this, resulted, in, the, use, of, the, creeping, barrage, which, would, lift, more, frequently, but, in, smaller, steps, sweeping, the, ground, ahead, and, moving, so, slowly, that, the, attackers, could, usually, follow, closely, behind, it, this, became, the, standard, method, of, attack, from, late, 1916, onward, the, main, benefit, of, the, barrage, was, suppression, of, the, enemy, rather, than, to, cause, casualties, or, material, damage, capturing, the, objective, was, half, the, battle, but, the, battle, was, won, only, if, the, objective, was, held, the, attacking, force, would, have, to, advance, with, not, only, the, weapons, required, to, capture, a, trench, but, also, the, tools, sandbags, picks, and, shovels, barbed, wire, to, fortify, and, defend, from, counter, attack, a, successful, advance, would, take, the, attackers, beyond, the, range, of, their, own, field, artillery, making, them, vulnerable, and, it, took, time, to, move, guns, up, over, broken, ground, the, germans, placed, great, emphasis, on, immediately, counter, attacking, to, regain, lost, ground, this, strategy, cost, them, dearly, in, 1917, when, the, british, started, to, limit, their, advances, so, as, to, be, able, to, meet, the, anticipated, counter, attack, from, a, position, of, strength, part, of, the, british, artillery, was, positioned, close, behind, the, original, start, line, and, took, no, part, in, the, initial, bombardment, so, as, to, be, ready, to, support, later, phases, of, the, operation, while, other, guns, were, moved, up, the, germans, were, the, first, to, apply, the, concept, of, defence, in, depth, where, the, front, line, zone, was, hundreds, of, metres, deep, and, contained, a, series, of, redoubts, rather, than, a, continuous, trench, each, redoubt, could, provide, supporting, fire, to, its, neighbours, and, while, the, attackers, had, freedom, of, movement, between, the, redoubts, they, would, be, subjected, to, withering, enfilade, fire, they, were, also, more, willing, than, their, opponents, to, make, a, strategic, withdrawal, to, a, superior, prepared, defensive, position, the, british, eventually, adopted, a, similar, approach, but, it, was, incompletely, implemented, when, the, germans, launched, the, 1918, spring, offensive, and, proved, disastrously, ineffective, france, by, contrast, relied, on, artillery, and, reserves, not, entrenchment, an, individual, unit, s, time, in, a, front, line, trench, was, usually, brief, from, as, little, as, one, day, to, as, much, as, two, weeks, at, a, time, before, being, relieved, the, 31st, australian, battalion, once, spent, 53, days, in, the, line, at, villers, bretonneux, but, such, a, duration, was, a, rare, exception, the, 10th, battalion, cef, averaged, frontline, tours, of, six, days, in, 1915, and, 1916, the, units, who, manned, the, frontline, trenches, the, longest, were, the, portuguese, expeditionary, corps, from, portugal, stationed, in, northern, france, unlike, the, other, allies, the, portuguese, couldn, t, rotate, units, from, the, front, lines, due, to, lack, of, reinforcements, sent, from, portugal, nor, could, they, replace, the, depleted, units, that, lost, manpower, due, to, the, war, of, attrition, with, this, rate, of, casualties, and, no, reinforcements, forthcoming, most, of, the, men, were, denied, leave, and, had, to, serve, long, periods, in, the, trenches, with, some, units, spending, up, to, six, consecutive, months, in, the, front, line, with, little, to, no, leave, during, that, time, on, an, individual, level, a, typical, british, soldier, s, year, could, be, divided, as, follows, even, when, in, the, front, line, the, typical, battalion, would, be, called, upon, to, engage, in, fighting, only, a, handful, of, times, a, year, making, an, attack, defending, against, an, attack, or, participating, in, a, raid, the, frequency, of, combat, would, increase, for, the, units, of, the, elite, fighting, divisions, on, the, allied, side, these, were, the, british, regular, divisions, the, canadian, corps, the, french, xx, corps, and, the, anzacs, some, sectors, of, the, front, saw, little, activity, throughout, the, war, making, life, in, the, trenches, comparatively, easy, when, the, i, anzac, corps, first, arrived, in, france, in, april, 1916, after, the, evacuation, of, gallipoli, they, were, sent, to, a, relatively, peaceful, sector, south, of, armenti, res, to, acclimatise, in, contrast, some, other, sectors, were, in, a, perpetual, state, of, violent, activity, on, the, western, front, ypres, was, invariably, hellish, especially, for, the, british, in, the, exposed, overlooked, salient, however, even, quiet, sectors, amassed, daily, casualties, through, sniper, fire, artillery, disease, and, poison, gas, in, the, first, six, months, of, 1916, before, the, launch, of, the, somme, offensive, the, british, did, not, engage, in, any, significant, battles, on, their, sector, of, the, western, front, and, yet, suffered, 107, 776, casualties, a, sector, of, the, front, would, be, allocated, to, an, army, corps, usually, comprising, three, divisions, two, divisions, would, occupy, adjacent, sections, of, the, front, and, the, third, would, be, in, rest, to, the, rear, this, breakdown, of, duty, would, continue, down, through, the, army, structure, so, that, within, each, front, line, division, typically, comprising, three, infantry, brigades, regiments, for, the, germans, two, brigades, would, occupy, the, front, and, the, third, would, be, in, reserve, within, each, front, line, brigade, typically, comprising, four, battalions, two, battalions, would, occupy, the, front, with, two, in, reserve, and, so, on, for, companies, and, platoons, the, lower, down, the, structure, this, division, of, duty, proceeded, the, more, frequently, the, units, would, rotate, from, front, line, duty, to, support, or, reserve, during, the, day, snipers, and, artillery, observers, in, balloons, made, movement, perilous, so, the, trenches, were, mostly, quiet, it, was, during, these, daytime, hours, that, the, soldiers, would, amuse, themselves, with, trench, magazines, because, of, the, peril, associated, with, daytime, activities, trenches, were, busiest, at, night, when, the, cover, of, darkness, allowed, movement, of, troops, and, supplies, the, maintenance, and, expansion, of, the, barbed, wire, and, trench, system, and, reconnaissance, of, the, enemy, s, defences, sentries, in, listening, posts, out, in, no, man, s, land, would, try, to, detect, enemy, patrols, and, working, parties, or, indications, that, an, attack, was, being, prepared, pioneered, by, the, princess, patricia, s, canadian, light, infantry, in, february, 1915, trench, raids, were, carried, out, in, order, to, capture, prisoners, and, booty, letters, and, other, documents, to, provide, intelligence, about, the, unit, occupying, the, opposing, trenches, as, the, war, progressed, raiding, became, part, of, the, general, british, policy, the, intention, being, to, maintain, the, fighting, spirit, of, the, troops, and, to, deny, no, man, s, land, to, the, germans, as, well, they, were, intended, to, compel, the, enemy, to, reinforce, which, exposed, their, troops, to, artillery, fire, such, dominance, was, achieved, at, a, high, cost, when, the, enemy, replied, with, their, own, artillery, and, a, post, war, british, analysis, concluded, the, benefits, were, probably, not, worth, the, cost, early, in, the, war, surprise, raids, would, be, mounted, particularly, by, the, canadians, but, increased, vigilance, made, achieving, surprise, difficult, as, the, war, progressed, by, 1916, raids, were, carefully, planned, exercises, in, combined, arms, and, involved, close, co, operation, between, infantry, and, artillery, a, raid, would, begin, with, an, intense, artillery, bombardment, designed, to, drive, off, or, kill, the, front, trench, garrison, and, cut, the, barbed, wire, then, the, bombardment, would, shift, to, form, a, box, barrage, or, cordon, around, a, section, of, the, front, line, to, prevent, a, counter, attack, intercepting, the, raid, however, the, bombardment, also, had, the, effect, of, notifying, the, enemy, of, the, location, of, the, planned, attack, thus, allowing, reinforcements, to, be, called, in, from, wider, sectors, approximately, 10, 15, percent, of, all, soldiers, who, fought, in, the, first, world, war, died, as, a, result, while, the, main, cause, of, death, in, the, trenches, came, from, shelling, and, gunfire, diseases, and, infections, were, always, present, and, became, prevalent, for, all, sides, as, the, war, progressed, medical, procedures, while, considerably, more, effective, than, at, any, previous, time, in, history, were, still, not, very, helpful, antibiotics, had, not, yet, been, discovered, or, invented, as, a, result, an, infection, caught, in, a, trench, often, went, untreated, and, could, fester, until, the, soldier, died, the, main, killer, in, the, trenches, was, artillery, fire, around, 75, percent, of, known, casualties, even, if, a, soldier, was, not, hit, directly, by, the, artillery, shell, fragments, and, debris, had, a, high, chance, of, wounding, those, in, close, proximity, to, the, blast, artillery, use, increased, tremendously, during, the, war, for, example, the, percentage, of, the, french, army, that, was, artillerymen, grew, from, 20, per, cent, in, 1914, to, 38, percent, by, 1918, the, second, largest, contributor, to, death, was, gunfire, bullets, from, rifles, and, machine, guns, which, was, responsible, for, 34, per, cent, of, french, military, casualties, once, the, war, entered, the, static, phase, of, trench, warfare, the, number, of, lethal, head, wounds, that, troops, were, receiving, from, fragmentation, increased, dramatically, the, french, were, the, first, to, see, a, need, for, greater, protection, and, began, to, introduce, steel, helmets, in, the, summer, of, 1915, the, adrian, helmet, replaced, the, traditional, french, kepi, and, was, later, adopted, by, the, belgian, italian, and, many, other, armies, at, about, the, same, time, the, british, were, developing, their, own, helmets, the, french, design, was, rejected, as, not, strong, enough, and, too, difficult, to, mass, produce, the, design, that, was, eventually, approved, by, the, british, was, the, brodie, helmet, this, had, a, wide, brim, to, protect, the, wearer, from, falling, objects, but, offered, less, protection, to, the, wearer, s, neck, when, the, americans, entered, the, war, this, was, the, helmet, they, chose, though, some, units, used, the, french, adrian, helmet, the, predominant, disease, in, the, trenches, of, the, western, front, was, trench, fever, trench, fever, was, a, common, disease, spread, through, the, faeces, of, body, lice, which, were, rampant, in, trenches, trench, fever, caused, headaches, shin, pain, splenomegaly, rashes, and, relapsing, fevers, resulting, in, lethargy, for, months, first, reported, on, the, western, front, in, 1915, by, a, british, medical, officer, additional, cases, of, trench, fever, became, increasingly, common, mostly, in, the, frontline, troops, in, 1921, microbiologist, sir, david, bruce, reported, that, over, one, million, allied, soldiers, were, infected, by, trench, fever, throughout, the, war, even, after, the, great, war, had, ended, disabled, veterans, in, britain, attributed, their, decreasing, quality, of, life, to, trench, fever, they, had, sustained, during, wartime, early, in, the, war, gas, gangrene, commonly, developed, in, major, wounds, in, part, because, the, clostridium, bacteria, responsible, are, ubiquitous, in, manure, fertilized, soil, common, in, western, european, agriculture, such, as, france, and, belgium, and, dirt, would, often, get, into, a, wound, or, be, rammed, in, by, shrapnel, explosion, or, bullet, in, 1914, 12, of, wounded, british, soldiers, developed, gas, gangrene, and, at, least, 100, 000, german, soldiers, died, directly, from, the, infection, after, rapid, advances, in, medical, procedures, and, practices, the, incidence, of, gas, gangrene, fell, to, 1, by, 1918, entrenched, soldiers, also, carried, many, intestinal, parasites, such, as, ascariasis, trichuriasis, and, tapeworm, these, parasites, were, common, amongst, soldiers, and, spread, amongst, them, due, to, the, unhygienic, environment, created, by, the, common, trench, where, there, were, no, true, sewage, management, procedures, this, ensured, that, parasites, and, diseases, would, spread, onto, rations, and, food, sources, that, would, then, be, eaten, by, other, soldiers, trench, foot, was, a, common, environmental, ailment, affecting, many, soldiers, especially, during, the, winter, it, is, one, of, several, immersion, foot, syndromes, it, was, characterized, by, numbness, and, pain, in, the, feet, but, in, bad, cases, could, result, in, necrosis, of, the, lower, limbs, trench, foot, was, a, large, problem, for, the, allied, forces, resulting, in, 75, 000, british, and, 2, 000, american, casualties, mandatory, routine, daily, or, more, often, foot, inspections, by, fellow, soldiers, along, with, systematic, use, of, soap, foot, powder, and, changing, socks, greatly, reduced, cases, of, trench, foot, in, 1918, us, infantry, were, issued, with, an, improved, and, more, waterproof, pershing, boot, in, an, attempt, to, reduce, casualties, from, trench, foot, to, the, surprise, of, medical, professionals, at, the, time, there, was, no, outbreak, of, typhus, in, the, trenches, of, the, western, front, despite, the, cold, and, harsh, conditions, being, perfect, for, the, reproduction, of, body, lice, that, transmit, the, disease, however, on, the, eastern, front, an, epidemic, of, typhus, claimed, between, 150, 000, 200, 000, lives, in, serbia, russia, also, suffered, a, globally, unprecedented, typhus, epidemic, during, the, last, two, years, of, the, conflict, that, was, exacerbated, by, harsh, winters, this, outbreak, resulted, in, approximately, 2, 5, million, recorded, deaths, 100, 000, of, them, being, red, army, soldiers, symptoms, of, typhus, include, a, characteristic, spotted, rash, which, was, not, always, present, severe, headache, sustained, high, fever, of, 39, c, 102, f, cough, severe, muscle, pain, chills, falling, blood, pressure, stupor, sensitivity, to, light, and, delirium, 10, to, 60, die, typhus, is, spread, by, body, lice, the, trenches, were, inhabited, by, millions, of, rats, which, were, often, responsible, for, the, spread, of, diseases, soldiers, attempts, to, cull, hordes, of, trench, rats, with, rifle, bayonets, were, common, early, in, the, war, but, the, rats, reproduced, faster, than, they, could, be, slaughtered, however, soldiers, still, partook, in, rat, hunts, as, a, form, of, entertainment, rats, would, feed, on, half, eaten, or, uneaten, rations, as, well, as, corpses, many, soldiers, were, more, afraid, of, rats, than, other, horrors, found, in, the, trenches, nervous, and, mental, breakdowns, amongst, soldiers, were, common, due, to, unrelenting, shellfire, and, the, claustrophobic, trench, environment, men, who, suffered, such, intense, breakdowns, were, often, rendered, completely, immobile, and, were, often, seen, cowering, low, in, the, trenches, unable, even, to, perform, instinctive, human, responses, such, as, running, away, or, fighting, back, this, condition, came, to, be, known, as, shell, shock, war, neurosis, or, battle, hypnosis, although, trenches, provided, cover, from, shelling, and, small, arms, fire, they, also, amplified, the, psychological, effects, of, shell, shock, as, there, was, no, way, to, escape, a, trench, if, shellfire, was, coming, if, a, soldier, became, too, debilitated, from, shell, shock, they, were, evacuated, from, the, trench, and, hospitalized, if, possible, in, some, cases, shell, shocked, soldiers, were, executed, for, cowardice, by, their, commanders, as, they, became, a, liability, this, was, often, done, by, a, firing, squad, composed, of, their, fellow, soldiers, often, from, the, same, unit, only, years, later, would, it, be, understood, that, such, men, were, suffering, from, shell, shock, during, the, war, 306, british, soldiers, were, officially, executed, by, their, own, side, throughout, world, war, i, the, major, combatants, slowly, developed, different, ways, of, breaking, the, stalemate, of, trench, warfare, the, germans, focused, more, on, new, tactics, while, the, british, and, french, focused, on, tanks, as, far, back, as, the, 18th, century, prussian, military, doctrine, vernichtungsgedanke, stressed, manoeuvre, and, force, concentration, to, achieve, a, decisive, battle, the, german, military, searched, for, ways, to, apply, this, in, the, face, of, trench, warfare, experiments, with, new, tactics, by, willy, rohr, a, prussian, captain, serving, in, the, vosges, mountains, in, 1915, got, the, attention, of, the, minister, of, war, these, tactics, carried, prussian, military, doctrine, down, to, smallest, units, specially, trained, troops, manoeuvred, and, massed, to, assault, positions, they, chose, on, their, own, during, the, next, two, years, the, german, army, tried, to, establish, special, stormtrooper, detachments, in, all, its, units, by, sending, selected, men, to, rohr, and, have, those, men, then, train, their, comrades, in, their, original, units, similar, tactics, were, developed, independently, in, other, countries, such, as, french, army, captain, andr, laffargue, in, 1915, and, russian, general, aleksei, brusilov, in, 1916, but, these, failed, to, be, adopted, as, any, military, doctrine, the, german, stormtrooper, methods, involved, men, rushing, forward, in, small, groups, using, whatever, cover, was, available, and, laying, down, covering, fire, for, other, groups, in, the, same, unit, as, they, moved, forward, the, new, tactics, intended, to, achieve, surprise, by, disrupting, entrenched, enemy, positions, aimed, to, bypass, strongpoints, and, to, attack, the, weakest, parts, of, an, enemy, s, line, additionally, they, acknowledged, the, futility, of, managing, a, grand, detailed, plan, of, operations, from, afar, opting, instead, for, junior, officers, on, the, spot, to, exercise, initiative, the, germans, employed, and, improved, infiltration, tactics, in, a, series, of, smaller, to, larger, battles, each, increasingly, successful, leading, up, to, the, battle, of, caporetto, against, the, italians, in, 1917, and, finally, the, massive, german, spring, offensive, in, 1918, against, the, british, and, french, german, infiltration, tactics, are, sometimes, called, hutier, tactics, by, others, after, oskar, von, hutier, the, general, leading, the, german, 18th, army, which, had, the, farthest, advance, in, that, offensive, after, a, stunningly, rapid, advance, the, offensive, failed, to, achieve, a, breakthrough, german, forces, stalled, after, outrunning, their, supply, artillery, and, reinforcements, which, could, not, catch, up, over, the, shell, torn, ground, left, ruined, by, allied, attacks, in, the, battle, of, the, somme, in, 1916, the, exhausted, german, forces, were, soon, pushed, back, in, the, allied, hundred, days, offensive, and, the, germans, were, unable, to, organise, another, major, offensive, before, the, war, s, end, in, post, war, years, other, nations, did, not, fully, appreciate, these, german, tactical, innovations, amidst, the, overall, german, defeat, mines, tunnels, under, enemy, lines, packed, with, explosives, and, detonated, were, widely, used, in, wwi, to, destroy, or, disrupt, enemy, s, trench, lines, mining, and, counter, mining, became, a, major, part, of, trench, warfare, the, dry, chalk, of, the, somme, was, especially, suited, to, mining, but, with, the, aid, of, pumps, it, was, also, possible, to, mine, in, the, sodden, clay, of, flanders, specialist, tunneling, companies, usually, made, up, of, men, who, had, been, miners, in, civilian, life, would, dig, tunnels, under, no, man, s, land, and, beneath, the, enemy, s, trenches, these, mines, would, then, be, packed, with, explosives, and, detonated, producing, a, large, crater, the, crater, served, two, purposes, it, could, destroy, or, breach, the, enemy, s, trench, and, by, virtue, of, the, raised, lip, that, they, produced, could, provide, a, ready, made, trench, closer, to, the, enemy, s, line, when, a, mine, was, detonated, both, sides, would, race, to, occupy, and, fortify, the, crater, if, the, miners, detected, an, enemy, tunnel, in, progress, they, would, often, counter, mine, and, try, to, drive, a, tunnel, under, the, enemy, s, tunnel, in, which, they, would, detonate, explosives, to, create, a, camouflet, to, destroy, the, enemy, s, tunnel, night, raids, were, also, conducted, with, the, sole, purpose, of, destroying, the, enemy, s, mine, workings, on, occasion, mines, would, cross, and, fighting, would, occur, underground, the, mining, skills, could, also, be, used, to, move, troops, unseen, on, one, occasion, a, whole, british, division, was, moved, through, interconnected, workings, and, sewers, without, german, observation, the, british, detonated, 19, mines, of, varying, sizes, on, july, 1, 1916, the, first, day, of, the, battle, of, the, somme, the, largest, mines, the, y, sap, mine, and, the, lochnagar, mine, each, containing, 24, tons, of, explosives, were, blown, near, la, boiselle, throwing, earth, 4, 000, feet, 1, 200, m, into, the, air, at, 3, 10, am, on, june, 7, 1917, a, series, of, mines, was, detonated, by, the, british, to, launch, the, battle, of, messines, the, average, mine, contained, 21, tons, of, explosive, and, the, largest, 125, feet, 38, m, beneath, saint, eloi, was, twice, the, average, at, 42, tons, as, remarked, by, general, plumer, to, his, staff, the, evening, before, the, attack, the, craters, from, these, and, many, other, mines, on, the, western, front, are, still, visible, today, two, undetonated, mines, remained, in, the, ground, near, messines, with, their, location, mislaid, after, the, war, one, blew, during, a, thunderstorm, in, 1955, the, other, remains, in, the, ground, significant, mining, operations, were, also, carried, out, on, the, italian, front, world, war, i, saw, large, scale, use, of, poison, gases, at, the, start, of, the, war, the, gas, agents, used, were, relatively, weak, and, delivery, unreliable, but, by, mid, war, advances, in, this, chemical, warfare, reached, horrifying, levels, the, first, methods, of, employing, gas, was, by, releasing, it, from, a, cylinder, when, the, wind, was, favourable, this, was, prone, to, miscarry, if, the, direction, of, the, wind, was, misjudged, also, the, cylinders, needed, to, be, positioned, in, the, front, trenches, where, they, were, likely, to, be, ruptured, by, enemy, bombardment, later, gas, was, delivered, directly, to, enemy, trenches, by, artillery, or, mortar, shell, reducing, friendly, casualties, significantly, lingering, agents, could, still, affect, friendly, troops, that, advanced, to, enemy, trenches, following, its, use, early, on, soldiers, made, improvised, gas, masks, by, urinating, on, a, handkerchief, and, putting, it, over, their, nose, and, mouth, so, the, urea, would, disable, the, poison, armies, rushed, to, issue, regulation, gas, masks, as, regular, equipment, for, front, line, troops, anti, gas, equipment, and, procedures, improved, significantly, during, the, war, to, the, point, that, gas, attacks, had, become, less, devastating, at, the, war, s, end, several, different, gas, agents, were, used, tear, gas, was, first, employed, in, august, 1914, by, the, french, but, this, could, only, temporarily, disable, the, enemy, in, april, 1915, chlorine, gas, was, first, used, by, germany, at, the, second, battle, of, ypres, exposure, to, a, large, dose, could, kill, and, those, not, killed, could, suffer, permanent, lung, damage, but, the, gas, was, easy, to, detect, by, scent, and, sight, phosgene, first, used, in, december, 1915, was, the, most, lethal, killing, gas, of, world, war, i, it, was, 18, times, more, powerful, than, chlorine, and, much, more, difficult, to, detect, however, the, most, effective, gas, was, mustard, gas, introduced, by, germany, in, july, 1917, mustard, gas, was, not, as, fatal, as, phosgene, but, it, was, hard, to, detect, and, lingered, on, the, surface, of, the, battlefield, so, could, inflict, casualties, over, a, long, period, even, if, not, inhaled, it, could, slowly, burn, the, skin, but, quickly, burned, via, the, eyes, or, any, wounds, causing, blindness, and, intense, suffering, mustard, gas, also, had, the, property, of, being, heavier, than, air, causing, it, to, sink, down, hills, and, therefore, down, into, trenches, casualties, from, mustard, gas, were, unlikely, to, be, fit, to, fight, again, yet, only, 2, of, mustard, gas, casualties, died, the, added, burden, of, long, term, care, of, casualties, from, mustard, gas, actually, increased, its, overall, effectiveness, compared, to, more, immediately, lethal, gas, agents, tanks, were, developed, by, the, british, and, french, as, a, means, to, attack, enemy, trenches, by, combining, heavy, firepower, machine, guns, or, light, artillery, guns, protection, from, small, arms, fire, armour, and, battlefield, mobility, tracks, the, british, tanks, were, designed, with, a, rhomboid, shape, to, easily, surmount, barbed, wire, and, other, obstacles, they, were, first, deployed, in, 1916, at, the, battle, of, the, somme, in, limited, numbers, proving, unreliable, and, ineffective, at, first, as, mechanical, and, logistical, issues, overshadowed, implementing, a, coherent, tank, doctrine, with, the, additional, challenge, of, traversing, ground, torn, apart, by, years, of, shell, fire, at, the, first, battle, of, cambrai, in, 1917, improved, tanks, in, larger, numbers, demonstrated, the, potential, of, tank, warfare, though, german, improvised, anti, tank, tactics, including, using, direct, fire, from, field, artillery, also, proved, effective, by, 1918, tank, capabilities, and, tactics, improved, their, numbers, increased, and, combined, with, french, tanks, finally, helped, break, the, stalemate, during, the, last, 100, days, of, the, war, allied, forces, harried, the, germans, back, using, infantry, supported, by, tanks, and, by, close, air, support, by, the, war, s, end, tanks, become, a, significant, element, of, warfare, the, proposed, british, plan, 1919, would, have, employed, tanks, as, a, primary, factor, in, military, strategy, however, the, impact, of, tanks, in, world, war, i, was, less, than, it, could, have, been, due, to, their, late, introduction, and, the, inherent, issues, that, plague, implementing, revolutionary, technology, the, introduction, of, the, tanks, would, mark, the, beginning, of, the, end, of, trench, warfare, between, the, two, world, wars, many, nations, developed, their, own, unique, tanks, and, divergent, theories, of, tank, tactics, including, the, uk, france, the, soviet, union, czechoslovakia, japan, the, us, and, italy, though, german, tank, development, was, restricted, by, the, terms, of, the, treaty, ending, world, war, i, germany, successfully, combined, their, own, tanks, plus, czech, tanks, from, occupied, czechoslovakia, with, infiltration, tactics, to, produce, blitzkrieg, during, world, war, ii, trenches, were, often, used, in, both, sides, particularly, the, nationalists, whose, military, ground, doctrine, emphasized, static, defence, the, republicans, also, employed, the, use, of, trenches, but, also, human, wave, attacks, most, notably, during, their, defence, of, casa, de, campo, in, the, siege, of, madrid, in, the, decade, leading, up, to, world, war, ii, the, french, built, the, maginot, line, based, on, their, experience, with, trench, warfare, in, world, war, i, the, maginot, line, was, an, extensive, state, of, the, art, defensive, system, far, superior, to, any, previous, trench, system, a, chain, of, massive, constructions, of, concrete, iron, and, steel, fortresses, bunkers, retractable, turrets, outposts, obstacles, and, sunken, artillery, emplacements, linked, by, tunnel, networks, it, covered, the, length, of, the, franco, german, border, and, was, 20, 25, kilometres, 12, 16, mi, wide, it, was, supported, by, numerous, underground, barracks, shelters, ammunition, dumps, and, depots, with, its, own, telephone, network, and, narrow, gauge, railways, with, armoured, locomotives, backed, up, with, heavy, rail, artillery, french, military, experts, placed, high, value, on, the, line, saying, it, would, curb, german, aggression, as, any, invasion, force, would, be, halted, long, enough, for, french, forces, to, mobilize, and, counterattack, furthermore, french, military, planning, during, the, inter, war, period, believed, that, the, line, would, force, the, germans, to, invade, belgium, this, would, allow, any, future, conflict, to, take, place, off, of, french, soil, by, bypassing, the, maginot, line, and, fighting, the, belgian, army, it, would, allow, the, french, military, to, move, its, best, formations, to, counter, in, the, battle, of, france, germany, invaded, belgium, and, the, best, anglo, french, forces, moved, to, meet, them, as, planned, however, the, germans, had, only, recently, changed, their, plans, from, what, the, french, had, anticipated, would, happen, instead, of, an, attack, through, central, belgium, the, main, german, attack, was, delivered, through, the, ardennes, forest, inter, war, french, planning, believed, it, would, take, the, germans, 9, days, to, move, forces, through, this, area, and, that, it, could, be, held, by, small, forces, the, german, forces, outpaced, expectations, and, soon, crossed, into, france, between, the, main, french, forces, and, the, maginot, line, they, then, advanced, towards, the, english, channel, and, surrounded, the, anglo, french, armies, small, secondary, german, attacks, concentrated, at, a, few, points, in, the, line, had, mixed, success, the, bulk, of, the, maginot, line, was, untouched, its, garrisons, withdrawn, and, flanked, due, to, the, lack, of, combat, much, of, it, has, survived, the, return, of, mobile, warfare, in, world, war, ii, reduced, the, emphasis, of, trench, warfare, as, defenders, commonly, lacked, the, time, to, build, up, such, battlefield, defences, before, they, were, forced, to, redeploy, due, to, the, more, rapidly, changing, strategic, situation, but, trench, systems, were, still, effective, wherever, mobility, was, limited, the, front, lines, were, static, or, around, known, critical, objectives, that, could, not, be, bypassed, more, quickly, improvised, defensive, fighting, positions, using, scrapes, or, foxholes, that, can, be, supplemented, by, sand, bags, local, materials, debris, or, rubble, remain, in, common, use, these, are, typically, improved, and, expanded, by, the, defenders, eventually, becoming, full, trench, systems, if, given, enough, time, and, resources, in, the, winter, war, the, mannerheim, line, was, a, system, of, flexible, field, fortification, for, the, defending, finns, while, having, very, few, bunkers, and, artillery, compared, to, heavy, defence, lines, like, the, maginot, line, it, allowed, defensive, platoons, to, regroup, between, field, fortifications, wood, earth, firing, posts, dugouts, and, pillboxes, instead, of, locking, them, into, bunkers, while, forcing, the, invaders, to, attack, trenches, as, in, world, war, i, without, armor, and, direct, fire, support, it, caused, heavy, losses, to, the, soviets, and, repelled, them, for, two, months, at, the, battle, of, sevastopol, red, army, forces, successfully, held, trench, systems, on, the, narrow, peninsula, for, several, months, against, intense, german, bombardment, the, western, allies, in, 1944, broke, through, the, incomplete, atlantic, wall, with, relative, ease, through, a, combination, of, amphibious, landings, naval, gunfire, air, attack, and, airborne, landings, combined, arms, tactics, where, infantry, artillery, armour, and, aircraft, cooperate, closely, greatly, reduced, the, importance, of, trench, warfare, it, was, however, still, a, valuable, method, for, reinforcing, natural, boundaries, and, creating, a, line, of, defence, for, example, at, the, battle, of, stalingrad, soldiers, on, both, sides, dug, trenches, within, the, ruins, as, well, in, the, battle, of, hurtgen, forest, both, american, and, german, soldiers, also, dug, trenches, and, foxholes, in, the, rugged, woods, of, the, forest, which, led, to, continuous, stalemates, and, failed, offensives, that, lasted, for, months, which, was, reminiscent, of, the, trench, warfare, of, world, war, i, the, battle, of, the, scheldt, due, to, the, geography, of, the, battle, field, greatly, involved, the, use, of, trench, warfare, in, addition, before, the, start, of, the, battle, of, kursk, the, soviets, constructed, a, system, of, defence, more, elaborate, than, any, they, built, during, world, war, i, these, defences, succeeded, in, stopping, the, german, armoured, pincers, from, meeting, and, enveloping, the, salient, the, italian, campaign, fought, from, 1943, until, the, end, of, the, war, in, europe, largely, consisted, of, the, allies, storming, strongly, fortified, german, lines, which, stretched, from, one, coast, over, the, mountains, to, the, other, coast, when, the, allies, broke, through, one, line, the, germans, would, retreat, up, the, peninsula, to, yet, another, freshly, prepared, fortified, line, at, the, start, of, the, battle, of, berlin, the, last, major, assault, on, germany, the, soviets, attacked, over, the, river, oder, against, german, troops, dug, in, on, the, seelow, heights, about, 50, km, 31, mi, east, of, berlin, entrenchment, allowed, the, germans, who, were, massively, outnumbered, to, survive, a, bombardment, from, the, largest, concentration, of, artillery, in, history, as, the, red, army, attempted, to, cross, the, marshy, riverside, terrain, they, lost, tens, of, thousands, of, casualties, to, the, entrenched, germans, before, breaking, through, during, the, pacific, war, the, japanese, used, a, labyrinth, of, underground, fixed, positions, to, slow, down, the, allied, advances, on, many, pacific, islands, the, japanese, built, fixed, fortifications, on, iwo, jima, okinawa, and, peleliu, using, a, system, of, tunnels, to, interconnect, their, fortified, positions, many, of, these, were, former, mine, shafts, that, were, turned, into, defence, positions, engineers, added, sliding, armored, steel, doors, with, multiple, openings, to, serve, both, artillery, and, machine, guns, cave, entrances, were, built, slanted, as, a, defence, against, grenade, and, flamethrower, attacks, the, caves, and, bunkers, were, connected, to, a, vast, system, throughout, the, defences, which, allowed, the, japanese, to, evacuate, or, reoccupy, positions, as, needed, and, to, take, advantage, of, shrinking, interior, lines, this, network, of, bunkers, tunnels, and, pillboxes, favoured, the, defence, for, instance, the, japanese, on, iwo, jima, had, several, levels, of, honeycombed, fortifications, the, nanpo, bunker, southern, area, islands, naval, air, hq, which, was, located, east, of, airfield, number, 2, had, enough, food, water, and, ammo, for, the, japanese, to, hold, out, for, three, months, the, bunker, was, 90, feet, deep, and, had, tunnels, running, in, various, directions, approximately, 500, 55, gallon, drums, filled, with, water, kerosene, and, fuel, oil, for, generators, were, located, inside, the, complex, gasoline, powered, generators, allowed, for, radios, and, lighting, to, be, operated, underground, the, japanese, caused, the, american, advance, to, slow, down, and, caused, massive, casualties, with, these, underground, fixed, positions, the, americans, eventually, used, flamethrowers, and, systematic, hand, to, hand, fighting, to, oust, the, defenders, the, american, ground, forces, were, supported, by, extensive, naval, artillery, and, had, complete, air, supremacy, provided, by, u, s, navy, and, marine, corps, aviators, throughout, the, entire, battle, trench, warfare, has, been, infrequent, in, recent, wars, when, two, large, armoured, armies, meet, the, result, has, generally, been, mobile, warfare, of, the, type, which, developed, in, world, war, ii, however, trench, warfare, re, emerged, in, the, latter, stages, of, the, chinese, civil, war, huaihai, campaign, and, the, korean, war, from, july, 1951, to, its, end, during, the, cold, war, nato, forces, routinely, trained, to, fight, through, extensive, works, called, soviet, style, trench, systems, named, after, the, warsaw, pact, s, complex, systems, of, field, fortifications, an, extension, of, soviet, field, entrenching, practices, for, which, they, were, famous, in, their, great, patriotic, war, the, eastern, front, of, world, war, ii, in, the, iran, iraq, war, both, armies, lacked, training, in, combined, arms, operations, both, countries, often, prepared, entrenched, defensive, positions, and, tunnels, to, protect, and, supply, the, cities, and, bases, throughout, the, regions, military, mobility, was, drastically, reduced, hidden, anti, tank, mines, and, unstable, footing, made, it, easy, to, slide, into, or, get, buried, in, a, camouflaged, anti, tank, trench, tactics, used, included, trench, warfare, machine, gun, posts, bayonet, charges, booby, traps, use, of, barbed, wire, across, trenches, and, on, no, man, s, land, iranian, human, wave, attacks, and, iraq, s, extensive, use, of, chemical, weapons, such, as, mustard, gas, against, iranian, troops, iraq, again, attempted, to, use, trenches, during, the, 1991, gulf, war, after, the, invasion, of, kuwait, saddam, hussein, with, the, objective, of, forcing, the, coalition, to, engage, in, costly, world, war, i, era, trench, warfare, ordered, the, construction, of, a, massive, fortification, line, in, the, saudi, kuwait, border, consisting, of, regular, trench, lines, flame, trenches, ditches, filled, with, oil, to, be, ignited, in, case, of, attack, sand, berms, trench, works, anti, tank, ditches, barbed, wire, and, minefields, which, became, known, as, the, saddam, line, however, at, the, start, of, the, liberation, of, kuwait, the, us, forces, charged, the, iraqi, lines, with, m1, abrams, tanks, modified, with, minesweeping, ploughs, and, m728, combat, engineer, vehicles, which, buried, the, trench, lines, and, in, many, cases, buried, iraqi, troops, alive, in, less, than, three, hours, after, the, initial, assault, us, and, coalition, forces, had, already, broken, through, and, bypassed, the, saddam, line, and, the, rest, of, war, was, composed, by, highly, mobile, manoeuvre, warfare, focusing, on, overwhelming, power, against, the, iraqis, there, was, an, extensive, trench, system, inside, and, outside, the, city, during, the, 1992, 1996, siege, of, sarajevo, it, was, used, mainly, for, transportation, to, the, front, line, or, to, avoid, snipers, inside, the, city, any, pre, existing, structures, were, used, as, trenches, the, best, known, example, is, the, bobsleigh, course, at, trebevi, which, was, used, by, both, serb, and, bosniaks, forces, during, the, siege, in, the, eritrean, ethiopian, war, of, 1998, 2000, the, widespread, use, of, trenches, raised, comparisons, to, the, trench, warfare, of, world, war, i, according, to, some, reports, trench, warfare, led, to, the, loss, of, thousands, of, young, lives, in, human, wave, assaults, on, eritrea, s, positions, the, eritrean, defences, were, eventually, overtaken, by, a, surprise, ethiopian, pincer, movement, on, the, western, front, attacking, a, mined, but, lightly, defended, mountain, without, trenches, resulting, in, the, capture, of, barentu, and, an, eritrean, retreat, the, element, of, surprise, in, the, attack, involved, the, use, of, donkeys, as, pack, animals, as, well, as, being, a, solely, infantry, affair, with, tanks, coming, in, afterwards, only, to, secure, the, area, the, front, line, in, korea, and, the, line, of, control, in, kashmir, between, pakistan, and, india, are, two, examples, of, demarcation, lines, which, could, become, hot, at, any, time, they, consist, of, kilometres, of, trenches, linking, fortified, strongpoints, and, in, korea, surrounded, by, millions, of, land, mines, the, indian, army, has, fortified, the, loc, with, 900, fixed, tank, turrets, the, borders, between, armenia, and, azerbaijan, amid, the, ongoing, nagorno, karabakh, conflict, are, also, heavily, fortified, with, trenches, and, barbed, wire, with, the, two, sides, regularly, trading, fire, in, the, russo, ukrainian, war, to, safeguard, and, assert, their, territories, both, ukrainian, and, russian, proxy, forces, have, resorted, to, digging, small, trench, networks, and, engaging, in, warfare, somewhat, akin, to, the, trench, fights, of, world, war, i, in, some, aspects, this, involves, soldiers, spending, extended, periods, within, trenches, employing, cement, mixers, and, excavators, to, construct, tunnel, networks, and, deep, bunkers, for, added, protection, after, the, minsk, peace, agreements, the, front, lines, did, not, move, significantly, until, the, 2022, russian, invasion, of, ukraine, as, both, sides, dug, elaborate, networks, of, trenches, and, deep, bunkers, for, protection, and, the, two, sides, mostly, fired, mortars, and, sniper, shots, at, each, other, the, 2022, invasion, also, saw, the, construction, of, trench, lines, and, similar, defensive, structures, by, both, sides, especially, after, the, end, of, the, initial, russian, offensive, resulting, in, a, static, war, of, attrition, with, slow, advances, and, artillery, duels, especially, in, donetsk, oblast, pictures, of, muddy, trenches, stumps, of, charred, trees, in, a, shell, pocked, landscape, made, the, battle, of, bakhmut, emblematic, for, its, trench, warfare, conditions, with, neither, side, making, any, significant, breakthroughs, amid, hundreds, of, casualties, reported, daily, modern, technology, has, adapted, to, the, trench, warfare, and, use, of, drones, and, mobile, networks, is, common, the, battlefield, has, been, described, as, world, war, i, with, 21st, century, intelligence, surveillance, and, reconnaissance, trench, warfare, has, become, a, powerful, symbol, of, the, futility, of, war, its, image, is, of, young, men, going, over, the, top, over, the, parapet, of, the, trench, to, attack, the, enemy, trench, line, into, a, maelstrom, of, fire, leading, to, near, certain, death, typified, by, the, first, day, of, the, battle, of, the, somme, on, which, the, british, army, suffered, nearly, 60, 000, casualties, or, the, grinding, slaughter, in, the, mud, of, passchendaele, to, the, french, the, equivalent, is, the, attrition, of, the, battle, of, verdun, in, which, the, french, army, suffered, over, 380, 000, documented, combat, deaths, trench, warfare, is, associated, with, mass, slaughter, in, appalling, conditions, many, critics, have, argued, that, brave, men, went, to, their, deaths, because, of, incompetent, and, narrow, minded, commanders, who, failed, to, adapt, to, the, new, conditions, of, trench, warfare, class, ridden, and, backward, looking, generals, put, their, faith, in, the, attack, believing, superior, morale, and, dash, would, overcome, the, weapons, and, moral, inferiority, of, the, defender, british, public, opinion, often, repeated, the, theme, that, their, soldiers, were, lions, led, by, donkeys, world, war, i, generals, are, often, portrayed, as, callously, persisting, in, repeated, hopeless, attacks, against, trenches, there, were, failures, such, as, passchendaele, and, sir, douglas, haig, has, often, been, criticised, for, allowing, his, battles, to, continue, long, after, they, had, lost, any, purpose, other, than, attrition, haig, s, defenders, counter, that, the, attrition, was, necessary, in, order, to, cause, attrition, in, the, german, army, the, problems, of, trench, warfare, were, recognised, and, attempts, were, made, to, address, them, these, included, improvements, in, artillery, infantry, tactics, and, the, development, of, tanks, by, 1918, taking, advantage, of, failing, german, morale, allied, attacks, were, generally, more, successful, and, suffered, fewer, casualties, in, the, hundred, days, offensive, there, was, a, return, to, mobile, warfare, however, if, both, sides, have, comparable, equipment, capability, and, conditions, the, trench, is, still, seen, in, modern, wars, notes, bibliography
