a, value, added, tax, vat, or, goods, and, services, tax, gst, general, consumption, tax, gct, is, a, consumption, tax, that, is, levied, on, the, value, added, at, each, stage, of, a, product, s, production, and, distribution, vat, is, similar, to, and, is, often, compared, with, a, sales, tax, vat, is, an, indirect, tax, because, the, consumer, who, ultimately, bears, the, burden, of, the, tax, is, not, the, entity, that, pays, it, specific, goods, and, services, are, typically, exempted, in, various, jurisdictions, products, exported, to, other, countries, are, typically, exempted, from, the, tax, typically, via, a, rebate, to, the, exporter, vat, is, usually, implemented, as, a, destination, based, tax, where, the, tax, rate, is, based, on, the, location, of, the, producer, vat, raises, about, a, fifth, of, total, tax, revenues, worldwide, and, among, the, members, of, the, organisation, for, economic, co, operation, and, development, oecd, 14, as, of, june, 2023, 175, of, the, 193, countries, with, un, membership, employ, a, vat, including, all, oecd, members, except, the, united, states, 14, germany, and, france, were, the, first, countries, to, implement, a, vat, enacting, a, general, consumption, tax, during, world, war, i, german, industrialist, wilhelm, von, siemens, proposed, the, concept, in, 1918, the, modern, variation, of, vat, was, first, implemented, by, france, in, 1954, in, its, ivory, coast, colony, assessing, the, experiment, as, successful, france, introduced, it, domestically, in, 1958, maurice, laur, joint, director, of, the, french, tax, authority, implemented, vat, on, 10, april, 1954, initially, directed, at, large, businesses, it, was, extended, over, time, to, include, all, business, sectors, in, france, it, is, the, largest, source, of, state, finance, accounting, for, nearly, 50, of, state, revenues, vat, can, be, accounts, based, or, invoice, based, all, countries, except, japan, use, the, invoice, method, using, invoices, each, seller, pays, vat, on, their, sales, and, passes, the, buyer, an, invoice, that, indicates, the, amount, of, tax, paid, excluding, deductions, input, tax, buyers, who, themselves, add, value, and, resell, the, product, pay, vat, on, their, own, sales, output, tax, the, difference, between, output, tax, and, input, tax, is, the, amount, paid, to, the, government, or, refunded, in, the, case, of, a, negative, amount, using, accounts, the, tax, is, calculated, as, a, percentage, of, the, difference, between, sales, and, purchases, from, taxed, accounts, vat, provides, an, incentive, for, businesses, to, register, and, keep, invoices, and, it, does, this, in, the, form, of, zero, rated, goods, and, vat, exemption, on, goods, not, resold, through, registration, a, business, documents, its, purchases, making, them, eligible, for, a, vat, credit, the, main, benefits, of, vat, are, that, in, relation, to, many, other, forms, of, taxation, it, does, not, distort, firms, production, decisions, it, is, difficult, to, evade, and, it, generates, a, substantial, amount, of, revenue, vat, has, no, effect, on, how, businesses, organize, because, the, same, amount, of, tax, is, collected, regardless, of, how, many, times, goods, change, hands, before, arriving, at, the, ultimate, consumer, by, contrast, sales, taxes, are, collected, on, each, transaction, encouraging, businesses, to, vertically, integrate, to, reduce, the, number, of, transactions, and, thereby, reduce, the, amount, of, tax, for, this, reason, vat, has, been, gaining, favor, over, traditional, sales, taxes, another, difference, is, that, vat, is, collected, at, the, national, level, while, in, countries, such, as, india, and, the, us, sales, tax, is, collected, at, the, point, of, sale, by, the, local, jurisdiction, leading, them, to, prefer, the, latter, method, the, main, disadvantage, of, vat, is, the, extra, accounting, required, by, those, in, the, supply, chain, however, payment, of, vat, is, made, simpler, when, the, vat, system, has, few, if, any, exemptions, such, as, with, gst, in, new, zealand, 10, sales, tax, so, the, consumer, pays, 10, 0, 15, extra, compared, to, the, no, taxation, scheme, and, the, government, collects, this, amount, the, retailers, pay, no, tax, directly, but, the, retailer, has, to, do, the, tax, related, paperwork, suppliers, and, manufacturers, have, the, administrative, burden, of, supplying, correct, state, exemption, certifications, that, the, retailer, must, verify, and, maintain, the, manufacturer, is, responsible, for, ensuring, that, their, customers, retailers, are, only, intermediates, and, not, end, consumers, otherwise, the, manufacturer, charges, the, tax, in, addition, the, retailer, tracks, what, is, taxable, and, what, is, not, along, with, the, various, tax, rates, in, each, city, where, it, operates, 10, vat, in, the, vat, example, above, the, consumer, has, paid, and, the, government, received, the, same, dollar, amount, as, with, a, sales, tax, at, each, stage, of, production, the, seller, collects, a, tax, and, the, buyer, pays, that, tax, the, buyer, can, then, be, reimbursed, for, paying, the, tax, but, only, by, successfully, selling, the, value, added, product, to, the, buyer, at, the, next, stage, in, the, previous, examples, if, the, retailer, fails, to, sell, some, of, its, inventory, it, suffers, a, greater, financial, loss, in, the, vat, scheme, in, comparison, to, the, sales, tax, regulatory, system, by, having, paid, a, higher, wholesale, price, on, the, product, it, wants, to, sell, each, business, is, responsible, for, handling, the, necessary, tax, paperwork, however, businesses, have, no, obligation, to, request, certifications, from, purchasers, who, are, not, end, users, or, of, providing, such, certifications, to, their, suppliers, but, they, incur, increased, accounting, costs, for, collecting, the, tax, the, simplified, examples, assume, incorrectly, that, taxes, are, non, distortionary, the, same, number, of, widgets, were, made, and, sold, both, before, and, after, the, introduction, of, the, tax, however, the, supply, and, demand, economic, model, suggests, that, any, tax, raises, the, cost, of, the, product, for, someone, in, raising, the, cost, the, supply, curve, shifts, leftward, consequently, the, quantity, of, a, good, purchased, decreases, and, or, the, price, at, which, it, is, sold, increases, vat, has, been, criticized, by, opponents, as, a, regressive, tax, meaning, that, the, poor, pay, more, as, a, percentage, of, their, income, relative, to, the, wealthier, individuals, given, the, higher, marginal, propensity, to, consume, among, the, poor, defenders, reply, that, relating, taxation, levels, to, income, is, an, arbitrary, standard, and, that, the, vat, is, in, fact, a, proportional, tax, an, oecd, study, found, that, vat, could, even, be, slightly, progressive, vat, s, effective, regressivity, can, be, reduced, by, applying, a, lower, rate, to, products, that, are, more, likely, to, be, consumed, by, the, poor, some, countries, compensate, by, implementing, transfer, payments, targeted, to, the, poor, the, incidence, of, vat, may, not, fall, entirely, on, consumers, as, traders, tend, to, absorb, vat, so, as, to, maintain, sales, volumes, conversely, not, all, cuts, in, vat, are, passed, on, in, lower, prices, vat, consequently, leads, to, a, deadweight, loss, if, cutting, prices, pushes, a, business, below, the, margin, of, profitability, the, effect, can, be, seen, when, vat, is, cut, or, abolished, sweden, reduced, vat, on, restaurant, meals, from, 25, to, 12, 5, creating, 11, 000, additional, jobs, vat, offers, distinctive, opportunities, for, evasion, and, fraud, especially, through, abuse, of, the, credit, and, refund, mechanism, vat, overclaim, fraud, reached, as, high, as, 34, in, romania, exports, are, generally, zero, rated, creating, opportunity, for, fraud, in, europe, the, main, source, of, problems, is, carousel, fraud, this, fraud, originated, in, the, 1970s, in, the, benelux, countries, vat, fraud, then, became, a, major, problem, in, the, uk, similar, fraud, possibilities, exist, inside, a, country, to, avoid, this, countries, such, as, sweden, hold, the, major, owner, of, a, limited, company, personally, responsible, because, vat, is, included, in, the, price, index, to, which, state, benefits, such, as, pensions, and, welfare, payments, are, linked, in, some, countries, as, well, as, public, sector, pay, some, of, the, apparent, revenue, is, churned, i, e, taxpayers, are, given, the, money, to, pay, the, tax, reducing, net, revenue, refund, delays, by, the, tax, administration, can, damage, businesses, compliance, costs, are, seen, as, a, burden, on, business, in, the, uk, compliance, costs, for, vat, have, been, estimated, to, be, about, 4, of, the, yield, with, greater, impacts, on, smaller, businesses, under, a, sales, tax, system, only, businesses, selling, to, the, end, user, are, required, to, collect, tax, and, bear, the, accounting, cost, of, collecting, the, tax, under, vat, manufacturers, and, wholesale, companies, also, incur, accounting, expenses, to, handle, the, additional, paperwork, required, for, collecting, vat, increasing, overhead, costs, and, prices, the, american, manufacturing, trade, action, coalition, in, the, united, states, consider, vat, charges, on, us, products, and, rebates, for, products, from, other, countries, to, be, an, unfair, trade, practice, amtac, claims, that, so, called, border, tax, disadvantage, is, the, greatest, contributing, factor, to, the, us, current, account, deficit, and, estimated, this, disadvantage, to, us, producers, and, service, providers, to, be, 518, billion, in, 2008, alone, us, politicians, such, as, congressman, bill, pascrell, advocate, either, changing, wto, rules, relating, to, vat, or, rebating, vat, charged, on, us, exporters, a, business, tax, rebate, for, exports, was, proposed, in, the, 2016, gop, tax, reform, policy, paper, the, assertion, that, this, border, adjustment, would, be, compatible, with, the, rules, of, the, wto, is, controversial, it, was, alleged, that, the, proposed, tax, would, favour, domestically, produced, goods, as, they, would, be, taxed, less, than, imports, to, a, degree, varying, across, sectors, for, example, the, wage, component, of, the, cost, of, domestically, produced, goods, would, not, be, taxed, a, 2021, study, reported, that, value, added, taxes, were, unlikely, to, distort, trade, flows, the, vat, rate, is, 20, however, the, expanded, application, is, zero, vat, for, many, operations, and, transactions, that, zero, vat, is, the, source, of, controversies, between, its, trading, partners, mainly, russia, which, is, against, the, zero, vat, and, promotes, wider, use, of, tax, credits, vat, is, replaced, with, fixed, payments,
