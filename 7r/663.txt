sovereignty, can, generally, be, defined, as, supreme, authority, sovereignty, entails, hierarchy, within, a, state, as, well, as, external, autonomy, for, states, in, any, state, sovereignty, is, assigned, to, the, person, body, or, institution, that, has, the, ultimate, authority, over, other, people, and, to, change, existing, laws, in, political, theory, sovereignty, is, a, substantive, term, designating, supreme, legitimate, authority, over, some, polity, in, international, law, sovereignty, is, the, exercise, of, power, by, a, state, de, jure, sovereignty, refers, to, the, legal, right, to, do, so, de, facto, sovereignty, refers, to, the, factual, ability, to, do, so, this, can, become, an, issue, of, special, concern, upon, the, failure, of, the, usual, expectation, that, de, jure, and, de, facto, sovereignty, exist, at, the, place, and, time, of, concern, and, reside, within, the, same, organization, the, term, arises, from, the, unattested, vulgar, latin, superanus, itself, a, derived, form, of, latin, super, over, meaning, chief, ruler, its, spelling, which, has, varied, since, the, word, s, first, appearance, in, english, in, the, 14th, century, was, influenced, by, the, english, word, reign, the, concept, of, sovereignty, has, had, multiple, conflicting, components, varying, definitions, and, diverse, and, inconsistent, applications, throughout, history, the, current, notion, of, state, sovereignty, contains, four, aspects, territory, population, authority, and, recognition, according, to, stephen, d, krasner, the, term, could, also, be, understood, in, four, different, ways, often, these, four, aspects, all, appear, together, but, this, is, not, necessarily, the, case, they, are, not, affected, by, one, another, and, there, are, historical, examples, of, states, that, were, non, sovereign, in, one, aspect, while, at, the, same, time, being, sovereign, in, another, of, these, aspects, according, to, immanuel, wallerstein, another, fundamental, feature, of, sovereignty, is, that, it, is, a, claim, that, must, be, recognized, if, it, is, to, have, any, meaning, sovereignty, is, a, hypothetical, trade, in, which, two, potentially, or, really, conflicting, sides, respecting, de, facto, realities, of, power, exchange, such, recognitions, as, their, least, costly, strategy, there, are, two, additional, components, of, sovereignty, that, should, be, discussed, empirical, sovereignty, and, juridical, sovereignty, empirical, sovereignty, deals, with, the, legitimacy, of, who, is, in, control, of, a, state, and, the, legitimacy, of, how, they, exercise, their, power, tilly, references, an, example, where, nobles, in, parts, of, europe, were, allowed, to, engage, in, private, rights, and, ustages, a, constitution, by, catalonia, recognized, that, right, which, demonstrates, empirical, sovereignty, as, david, samuel, points, out, this, is, an, important, aspect, of, a, state, because, there, has, to, be, a, designated, individual, or, group, of, individuals, that, are, acting, on, behalf, of, the, people, of, the, state, juridical, sovereignty, emphasizes, the, importance, of, other, states, recognizing, the, rights, of, a, state, to, exercise, their, control, freely, with, little, interference, for, example, jackson, rosberg, and, jones, explain, how, the, sovereignty, and, survival, of, african, states, were, more, largely, influenced, by, legal, recognition, rather, than, material, aid, douglass, north, identifies, that, institutions, want, structure, and, these, two, forms, of, sovereignty, can, be, a, method, for, developing, structure, for, a, while, the, united, nations, highly, valued, juridical, sovereignty, and, attempted, to, reinforce, its, principle, often, more, recently, the, united, nations, is, shifting, away, and, focusing, on, establishing, empirical, sovereignty, michael, barnett, notes, that, this, is, largely, due, to, the, effects, of, the, post, cold, war, era, because, the, united, nations, believed, that, to, have, peaceful, relations, states, should, establish, peace, within, their, territory, as, a, matter, of, fact, theorists, found, that, during, the, post, cold, war, era, many, people, focused, on, how, stronger, internal, structures, promote, inter, state, peace, for, instance, zaum, argues, that, many, weak, and, impoverished, countries, that, were, affected, by, the, cold, war, were, given, assistance, to, develop, their, lacking, sovereignty, through, this, sub, concept, of, empirical, statehood, the, roman, jurist, ulpian, observed, that, ulpian, was, expressing, the, idea, that, the, emperor, exercised, a, rather, absolute, form, of, sovereignty, that, originated, in, the, people, although, he, did, not, use, the, term, expressly, ulpian, s, statements, were, known, in, medieval, europe, but, sovereignty, was, an, important, concept, in, medieval, times, medieval, monarchs, were, not, sovereign, at, least, not, strongly, so, because, they, were, constrained, by, and, shared, power, with, their, feudal, aristocracy, furthermore, both, were, strongly, constrained, by, custom, sovereignty, existed, during, the, medieval, period, as, the, de, jure, rights, of, nobility, and, royalty, sovereignty, reemerged, as, a, concept, in, the, late, 16th, century, a, time, when, civil, wars, had, created, a, craving, for, a, stronger, central, authority, when, monarchs, had, begun, to, gather, power, onto, their, own, hands, at, the, expense, of, the, nobility, and, the, modern, nation, state, was, emerging, jean, bodin, partly, in, reaction, to, the, chaos, of, the, french, wars, of, religion, presented, theories, of, sovereignty, calling, for, a, strong, central, authority, in, the, form, of, absolute, monarchy, in, his, 1576, treatise, les, six, livres, de, la, r, publique, six, books, of, the, republic, bodin, argued, that, it, is, inherent, in, the, nature, of, the, state, that, sovereignty, must, be, the, treatise, is, frequently, viewed, as, the, first, european, text, theorizing, state, sovereignty, bodin, rejected, the, notion, of, transference, of, sovereignty, from, people, to, the, ruler, also, known, as, the, sovereign, natural, law, and, divine, law, confer, upon, the, sovereign, the, right, to, rule, and, the, sovereign, is, not, above, divine, law, or, natural, law, he, is, above, i, e, not, bound, by, only, positive, law, that, is, laws, made, by, humans, he, emphasized, that, a, sovereign, is, bound, to, observe, certain, basic, rules, derived, from, the, divine, law, the, law, of, nature, or, reason, and, the, law, that, is, common, to, all, nations, jus, gentium, as, well, as, the, fundamental, laws, of, the, state, that, determine, who, is, the, sovereign, who, succeeds, to, sovereignty, and, what, limits, the, sovereign, power, thus, bodin, s, sovereign, was, restricted, by, the, constitutional, law, of, the, state, and, by, the, higher, law, that, was, considered, as, binding, upon, every, human, being, the, fact, that, the, sovereign, must, obey, divine, and, natural, law, imposes, ethical, constraints, on, him, bodin, also, held, that, the, lois, royales, the, fundamental, laws, of, the, french, monarchy, which, regulated, matters, such, as, succession, are, natural, laws, and, are, binding, on, the, french, sovereign, despite, his, commitment, to, absolutism, bodin, held, some, moderate, opinions, on, how, government, should, in, practice, be, carried, out, he, held, that, although, the, sovereign, is, not, obliged, to, it, is, advisable, for, him, as, a, practical, expedient, to, convene, a, senate, from, whom, he, can, obtain, advice, to, delegate, some, power, to, magistrates, for, the, practical, administration, of, the, law, and, to, use, the, estates, as, a, means, of, communicating, with, the, people, bodin, believed, that, the, most, divine, most, excellent, and, the, state, form, most, proper, to, royalty, is, governed, partly, aristocratically, and, partly, democratically, during, the, age, of, enlightenment, the, idea, of, sovereignty, gained, both, legal, and, moral, force, as, the, main, western, description, of, the, meaning, and, power, of, a, state, in, particular, the, social, contract, as, a, mechanism, for, establishing, sovereignty, was, suggested, and, by, 1800, widely, accepted, especially, in, the, new, united, states, and, france, though, also, in, great, britain, to, a, lesser, extent, thomas, hobbes, in, leviathan, 1651, put, forward, a, conception, of, sovereignty, similar, to, bodin, s, which, had, just, achieved, legal, status, in, the, peace, of, westphalia, but, for, different, reasons, he, created, the, first, modern, version, of, the, social, contract, or, contractarian, theory, arguing, that, to, overcome, the, nasty, brutish, and, short, quality, of, life, without, the, cooperation, of, other, human, beings, people, must, join, in, a, commonwealth, and, submit, to, a, soveraigne, power, that, can, compel, them, to, act, in, the, common, good, hobbes, was, thus, the, first, to, write, that, relations, between, the, people, and, the, sovereign, were, based, on, negotiation, rather, than, natural, submission, 10, his, expediency, argument, attracted, many, of, the, early, proponents, of, sovereignty, hobbes, strengthened, the, definition, of, sovereignty, beyond, either, westphalian, or, bodin, s, by, saying, that, it, must, be, hobbes, hypothesis, that, the, ruler, s, sovereignty, is, contracted, to, him, by, the, people, in, return, for, his, maintaining, their, physical, safety, led, him, to, conclude, that, if, and, when, the, ruler, fails, the, people, recover, their, ability, to, protect, themselves, by, forming, a, new, contract, hobbes, s, theories, decisively, shape, the, concept, of, sovereignty, through, the, medium, of, social, contract, theories, jean, jacques, rousseau, s, 1712, 1778, definition, of, popular, sovereignty, with, early, antecedents, in, francisco, su, rez, s, theory, of, the, origin, of, power, provides, that, the, people, are, the, legitimate, sovereign, rousseau, considered, sovereignty, to, be, inalienable, he, condemned, the, distinction, between, the, origin, and, the, exercise, of, sovereignty, a, distinction, upon, which, constitutional, monarchy, or, representative, democracy, is, founded, john, locke, and, montesquieu, are, also, key, figures, in, the, unfolding, of, the, concept, of, sovereignty, their, views, differ, with, rousseau, and, with, hobbes, on, this, issue, of, alienability, the, second, book, of, jean, jacques, rousseau, s, du, contrat, social, ou, principes, du, droit, politique, 1762, deals, with, sovereignty, and, its, rights, sovereignty, or, the, general, will, is, inalienable, for, the, will, cannot, be, transmitted, it, is, indivisible, since, it, is, essentially, general, it, is, infallible, and, always, right, determined, and, limited, in, its, power, by, the, common, interest, it, acts, through, laws, law, is, the, decision, of, the, general, will, regarding, some, object, of, common, interest, but, though, the, general, will, is, always, right, and, desires, only, good, its, judgment, is, not, always, enlightened, and, consequently, does, not, always, see, wherein, the, common, good, lies, hence, the, necessity, of, the, legislator, but, the, legislator, has, of, himself, no, authority, he, is, only, a, guide, who, drafts, and, proposes, laws, but, the, people, alone, that, is, the, sovereign, or, general, will, has, authority, to, make, and, impose, them, rousseau, in, the, social, contract, argued, the, growth, of, the, state, giving, the, trustees, of, public, authority, more, and, means, to, abuse, their, power, the, more, the, government, has, to, have, force, to, contain, the, people, the, more, force, the, sovereign, should, have, in, turn, to, contain, the, government, with, the, understanding, that, the, sovereign, is, a, collective, being, of, wonder, book, ii, chapter, i, resulting, from, the, general, will, of, the, people, and, that, what, any, man, whoever, he, may, be, orders, on, his, own, is, not, a, law, book, ii, chapter, vi, and, predicated, on, the, assumption, that, the, people, have, an, unbiased, means, by, which, to, ascertain, the, general, will, thus, the, legal, maxim, there, is, no, law, without, a, sovereign, according, to, hendrik, spruyt, the, sovereign, state, emerged, as, a, response, to, changes, in, international, trade, forming, coalitions, that, wanted, sovereign, states, so, that, the, sovereign, state, s, emergence, was, not, inevitable, it, arose, because, of, a, particular, conjuncture, of, social, and, political, interests, in, europe, once, states, are, recognized, as, sovereign, they, are, rarely, recolonized, merged, or, dissolved, today, no, state, is, sovereign, in, the, sense, they, were, prior, to, the, second, world, war, transnational, governance, agreements, and, institutions, the, globalized, economy, and, pooled, sovereignty, unions, such, as, the, european, union, have, eroded, the, sovereignty, of, traditional, states, the, centuries, long, movement, which, developed, a, global, system, of, sovereign, states, came, to, an, end, when, the, excesses, of, world, war, ii, made, it, clear, to, nations, that, some, curtailment, of, the, rights, of, sovereign, states, was, necessary, if, future, cruelties, and, injustices, were, to, be, prevented, in, the, years, immediately, prior, to, the, war, national, socialist, theorist, carl, schmitt, argued, that, sovereignty, had, supremacy, over, constitutional, and, international, constraints, arguing, that, states, as, sovereigns, could, not, be, judged, and, punished, after, the, holocaust, the, vast, majority, of, states, rejected, the, prior, westphalian, permissiveness, towards, such, supremacist, power, based, sovereignty, formulations, and, signed, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, in, 1948, it, was, the, first, step, towards, circumscription, of, the, powers, of, sovereign, nations, soon, followed, by, the, genocide, convention, which, legally, required, nations, to, punish, genocide, based, on, these, and, similar, human, rights, agreements, beginning, in, 1990, there, was, a, practical, expression, of, this, circumscription, when, the, westphalian, principle, of, non, intervention, was, no, longer, observed, for, cases, where, the, united, nations, or, another, international, organization, endorsed, a, political, or, military, action, previously, actions, in, yugoslavia, bosnia, kosovo, somalia, rwanda, haiti, cambodia, or, liberia, would, have, been, regarded, as, illegitimate, interference, in, internal, affairs, in, 2005, the, revision, of, the, concept, of, sovereignty, was, made, explicit, with, the, responsibility, to, protect, agreement, endorsed, by, all, member, states, of, the, united, nations, if, a, state, fails, this, responsibility, either, by, perpetrating, massive, injustice, or, being, incapable, of, protecting, its, citizens, then, outsiders, may, assume, that, responsibility, despite, prior, norms, forbidding, such, interference, in, a, nation, s, sovereignty, european, integration, is, the, second, form, of, post, world, war, change, in, the, norms, of, sovereignty, representing, a, significant, shift, since, member, nations, are, no, longer, absolutely, sovereign, some, theorists, such, as, jacques, maritain, and, bertrand, de, jouvenel, have, attacked, the, legitimacy, of, the, earlier, concepts, of, sovereignty, with, maritain, advocating, that, the, concept, be, discarded, entirely, since, it, efforts, to, curtail, absolute, sovereignty, have, met, with, substantial, resistance, by, sovereigntist, movements, in, multiple, countries, who, seek, to, take, back, control, from, such, transnational, governance, groups, and, agreements, restoring, the, world, to, pre, world, war, ii, norms, of, sovereignty, there, exists, perhaps, no, conception, the, meaning, of, which, is, more, controversial, than, that, of, sovereignty, it, is, an, indisputable, fact, that, this, conception, from, the, moment, when, it, was, introduced, into, political, science, until, the, present, day, has, never, had, a, meaning, which, was, universally, agreed, upon, lassa, oppenheim, 30, 03, 1858, 07, 10, 1919, an, authority, on, international, law, an, important, factor, of, sovereignty, is, its, degree, of, absoluteness, a, sovereign, power, has, absolute, sovereignty, when, it, is, not, restricted, by, a, constitution, by, the, laws, of, its, predecessors, or, by, custom, and, no, areas, of, law, or, policy, are, reserved, as, being, outside, its, control, international, law, policies, and, actions, of, neighboring, states, cooperation, and, respect, of, the, populace, means, of, enforcement, and, resources, to, enact, policy, are, factors, that, might, limit, sovereignty, for, example, parents, are, not, guaranteed, the, right, to, decide, some, matters, in, the, upbringing, of, their, children, independent, of, societal, regulation, and, municipalities, do, not, have, unlimited, jurisdiction, in, local, matters, thus, neither, parents, nor, municipalities, have, absolute, sovereignty, theorists, have, diverged, over, the, desirability, of, increased, absoluteness, a, key, element, of, sovereignty, in, a, legalistic, sense, is, that, of, exclusivity, of, jurisdiction, also, described, as, the, ultimate, arbiter, in, all, disputes, on, the, territory, specifically, the, degree, to, which, decisions, made, by, a, sovereign, entity, might, be, contradicted, by, another, authority, along, these, lines, the, german, sociologist, max, weber, proposed, that, sovereignty, is, a, community, s, monopoly, on, the, legitimate, use, of, force, and, thus, any, group, claiming, the, right, to, violence, must, either, be, brought, under, the, yoke, of, the, sovereign, proven, illegitimate, or, otherwise, contested, and, defeated, for, sovereignty, to, be, genuine, international, law, competing, branches, of, government, and, authorities, reserved, for, subordinate, entities, such, as, federated, states, or, republics, represent, legal, infringements, on, exclusivity, social, institutions, such, as, religious, bodies, corporations, and, competing, political, parties, might, represent, de, facto, infringements, on, exclusivity, de, jure, or, legal, sovereignty, concerns, the, expressed, and, institutionally, recognised, right, to, exercise, control, over, a, territory, de, facto, sovereignty, means, sovereignty, exists, in, practice, irrespective, of, anything, legally, accepted, as, such, usually, in, writing, cooperation, and, respect, of, the, populace, control, of, resources, in, or, moved, into, an, area, means, of, enforcement, and, security, and, ability, to, carry, out, various, functions, of, state, all, represent, measures, of, de, facto, sovereignty, when, control, is, practiced, predominantly, by, the, military, or, police, force, it, is, considered, coercive, sovereignty, state, sovereignty, is, sometimes, viewed, synonymously, with, independence, however, sovereignty, can, be, transferred, as, a, legal, right, whereas, independence, cannot, a, state, can, achieve, de, facto, independence, long, after, acquiring, sovereignty, such, as, in, the, case, of, cambodia, laos, and, vietnam, additionally, independence, can, also, be, suspended, when, an, entire, region, becomes, subject, to, an, occupation, for, example, when, iraq, was, overrun, by, foreign, forces, in, the, iraq, war, of, 2003, iraq, had, not, been, annexed, by, any, country, so, sovereignty, over, it, had, not, been, claimed, by, any, foreign, state, despite, the, facts, on, the, ground, alternatively, independence, can, be, lost, completely, when, sovereignty, itself, becomes, the, subject, of, dispute, the, pre, world, war, ii, administrations, of, latvia, lithuania, and, estonia, maintained, an, exile, existence, and, considerable, international, recognition, whilst, their, territories, were, annexed, by, the, soviet, union, and, governed, locally, by, their, pro, soviet, functionaries, when, in, 1991, latvia, lithuania, and, estonia, re, enacted, independence, it, was, done, so, on, the, basis, of, continuity, directly, from, the, pre, soviet, republics, another, complicated, sovereignty, scenario, can, arise, when, regime, itself, is, the, subject, of, dispute, in, the, case, of, poland, the, people, s, republic, of, poland, which, governed, poland, from, 1945, to, 1989, is, now, seen, to, have, been, an, illegal, entity, by, the, modern, polish, administration, the, post, 1989, polish, state, claims, direct, continuity, from, the, second, polish, republic, which, ended, in, 1939, for, other, reasons, however, poland, maintains, its, communist, era, outline, as, opposed, to, its, pre, world, war, ii, shape, which, included, areas, now, in, belarus, czech, republic, lithuania, slovakia, and, ukraine, but, did, not, include, some, of, its, western, regions, that, were, then, in, germany, additionally, sovereignty, can, be, achieved, without, independence, such, as, how, the, declaration, of, state, sovereignty, of, the, russian, soviet, federative, socialist, republic, made, the, russian, soviet, federative, socialist, republic, a, sovereign, entity, within, but, not, independent, from, the, ussr, at, the, opposite, end, of, the, scale, there, is, no, dispute, regarding, the, self, governance, of, certain, self, proclaimed, states, such, as, the, republic, of, kosovo, or, somaliland, see, list, of, states, with, limited, recognition, but, most, of, them, are, puppet, states, since, their, governments, neither, answer, to, a, bigger, state, nor, is, their, governance, subjected, to, supervision, the, sovereignty, i, e, legal, right, to, govern, however, is, disputed, in, both, cases, as, the, first, entity, is, claimed, by, serbia, and, the, second, by, somalia, internal, sovereignty, is, the, relationship, between, sovereign, power, and, the, political, community, a, central, concern, is, legitimacy, by, what, right, does, a, government, exercise, authority, claims, of, legitimacy, might, refer, to, the, divine, right, of, kings, or, to, a, social, contract, i, e, popular, sovereignty, max, weber, offered, a, first, categorization, of, political, authority, and, legitimacy, with, the, categories, of, traditional, charismatic, and, legal, rational, with, sovereignty, meaning, holding, supreme, independent, authority, over, a, region, or, state, internal, sovereignty, refers, to, the, internal, affairs, of, the, state, and, the, location, of, supreme, power, within, it, a, state, that, has, internal, sovereignty, is, one, with, a, government, that, has, been, elected, by, the, people, and, has, the, popular, legitimacy, internal, sovereignty, examines, the, internal, affairs, of, a, state, and, how, it, operates, it, is, important, to, have, strong, internal, sovereignty, to, keeping, order, and, peace, when, you, have, weak, internal, sovereignty, organisations, such, as, rebel, groups, will, undermine, the, authority, and, disrupt, the, peace, the, presence, of, a, strong, authority, allows, you, to, keep, the, agreement, and, enforce, sanctions, for, the, violation, of, laws, the, ability, for, leadership, to, prevent, these, violations, is, a, key, variable, in, determining, internal, sovereignty, the, lack, of, internal, sovereignty, can, cause, war, in, one, of, two, ways, first, undermining, the, value, of, agreement, by, allowing, costly, violations, and, second, requiring, such, large, subsidies, for, implementation, that, they, render, war, cheaper, than, peace, leadership, needs, to, be, able, to, promise, members, especially, those, like, armies, police, forces, or, paramilitaries, will, abide, by, agreements, the, presence, of, strong, internal, sovereignty, allows, a, state, to, deter, opposition, groups, in, exchange, for, bargaining, while, the, operations, and, affairs, within, a, state, are, relative, to, the, level, of, sovereignty, within, that, state, there, is, still, an, argument, over, who, should, hold, the, authority, in, a, sovereign, state, this, argument, between, who, should, hold, the, authority, within, a, sovereign, state, is, called, the, traditional, doctrine, of, public, sovereignty, this, discussion, is, between, an, internal, sovereign, or, an, authority, of, public, sovereignty, an, internal, sovereign, is, a, political, body, that, possesses, ultimate, final, and, independent, authority, one, whose, decisions, are, binding, upon, all, citizens, groups, and, institutions, in, society, early, thinkers, believed, sovereignty, should, be, vested, in, the, hands, of, a, single, person, a, monarch, they, believed, the, overriding, merit, of, vesting, sovereignty, in, a, single, individual, was, that, sovereignty, would, therefore, be, indivisible, it, would, be, expressed, in, a, single, voice, that, could, claim, final, authority, an, example, of, an, internal, sovereign, is, louis, xiv, of, france, during, the, seventeenth, century, louis, xiv, claimed, that, he, was, the, state, jean, jacques, rousseau, rejected, monarchical, rule, in, favor, of, the, other, type, of, authority, within, a, sovereign, state, public, sovereignty, public, sovereignty, is, the, belief, that, ultimate, authority, is, vested, in, the, people, themselves, expressed, in, the, idea, of, the, general, will, this, means, that, the, power, is, elected, and, supported, by, its, members, the, authority, has, a, central, goal, of, the, good, of, the, people, in, mind, the, idea, of, public, sovereignty, has, often, been, the, basis, for, modern, democratic, theory, within, the, modern, governmental, system, internal, sovereignty, is, usually, found, in, states, that, have, public, sovereignty, and, is, rarely, found, within, a, state, controlled, by, an, internal, sovereign, a, form, of, government, that, is, a, little, different, from, both, is, the, uk, parliament, system, john, austin, argued, that, sovereignty, in, the, uk, was, vested, neither, in, the, crown, nor, in, the, people, but, in, the, queen, in, parliament, this, is, the, origin, of, the, doctrine, of, parliamentary, sovereignty, and, is, usually, seen, as, the, fundamental, principle, of, the, british, constitution, with, these, principles, of, parliamentary, sovereignty, majority, control, can, gain, access, to, unlimited, constitutional, authority, creating, what, has, been, called, elective, dictatorship, or, modern, autocracy, public, sovereignty, in, modern, governments, is, a, lot, more, common, with, examples, like, the, us, canada, australia, and, india, where, the, government, is, divided, into, different, levels, external, sovereignty, concerns, the, relationship, between, sovereign, power, and, other, states, for, example, the, united, kingdom, uses, the, following, criterion, when, deciding, under, what, conditions, other, states, recognise, a, political, entity, as, having, sovereignty, over, some, territory, sovereignty, a, government, which, exercises, de, facto, administrative, control, over, a, country, and, is, not, subordinate, to, any, other, government, in, that, country, or, a, foreign, sovereign, state, the, arantzazu,

another, s, territory, permissible, following, the, thirty, years, war, a, european, religious, conflict, that, embroiled, much, of, the, continent, the, peace, of, westphalia, in, 1648, established, the, notion, of, territorial, sovereignty, as, a, norm, of, noninterference, in, the, affairs, of, other, states, so, called, westphalian, sovereignty, even, though, the, treaty, itself, reaffirmed, the, multiple, levels, of, the, sovereignty, of, the, holy, roman, empire, this, resulted, as, a, natural, extension, of, the, older, principle, of, cuius, regio, eius, religio, whose, realm, his, religion, leaving, the, roman, catholic, church, with, little, ability, to, interfere, with, the, internal, affairs, of, many, european, states, it, is, a, myth, however, that, the, treaties, of,

member, states, this, is, called, pooled, sovereignty, another, example, of, shared, and, pooled, sovereignty, is, the, acts, of, union, 1707, which, created, the, unitary, state, now, known, as, the, united, kingdom, it, was, a, full, economic, union, meaning, the, scottish, and, english, systems, of, currency, taxation, and, laws, regulating, trade, were, aligned, nonetheless, scotland, and,

between, holding, sovereignty, and, exercising, military, occupation, in, regard, to, military, occupation, international, law, prescribes, the, limits, of, the, occupant, s, power, occupation, does, not, displace, the, sovereignty, of, the, occupied, state, though, for, the, time, being, the, occupant, may, exercise, supreme, governing, authority, nor, does, occupation, effect, any, annexation,

force, to, the, occupied, territory, to, a, large, extent, the, original, academic, foundation, for, the, concept, of, military, occupation, arose, from, on, the, law, of, war, and, peace, 1625, by, hugo, grotius, and, the, law, of, nations, 1758, by, emmerich, de, vattel, binding, international, rules, regarding, the, conduct, of, military, occupation, were, more, carefully, codified, in, the,

1907, the, rules, of, land, warfare, expressed, in, the, convention, undoubtedly, represented, an, advance, over, existing, international, law, at, the, time, of, their, adoption, but, by, 1939, these, rules, were, recognized, by, all, civilized, nations, and, were, regarded, as, being, declaratory, of, the, laws, and, customs, of, war, a, number, of, modes, for, acquisition, of, sovereignty, are, presently, or, have, historically, been, recognized, in, international, law, as, lawful, methods, by, which, a, state, may, acquire, sovereignty, over, external, territory, the, classification, of, these, modes, originally, derived, from, roman, property, law, and, from, the, 15th, and, 16th, century, with, the, development, of, international, law, the, modes, are, there, exist, vastly, differing, views, on, the, moral, basis, of, sovereignty, a, fundamental, polarity, is, between, theories, which, assert, that, sovereignty, is, vested, directly, in, the, sovereigns, by, divine, or, natural, right, and, theories, which, assert, it, originates, from, the, people, in, the, latter, case, there, is, a, further, division, into, those, which, assert, that, the, people, effectively, transfer, their, sovereignty, to, the, sovereign, hobbes, and, those, which, assert, that, the, people, retain, their, sovereignty, rousseau, during, the, brief, period, of, absolute, monarchies, in, europe, the, divine, right, of, kings, was, an, important, competing, justification, for, the, exercise, of, sovereignty, the, mandate, of, heaven, had, similar, implications, in, china, for, the, justification, of, the, emperor, s, rule, though, it, was, largely, replaced, with, discussions, of, western, style, sovereignty, by, the, late, 19th, century, a, republic, is, a, form, of,
