a, prisoner, of, war, pow, is, a, person, who, is, held, captive, by, a, belligerent, power, during, or, immediately, after, an, armed, conflict, the, earliest, recorded, usage, of, the, phrase, prisoner, of, war, dates, back, to, 1610, belligerents, hold, prisoners, of, war, in, custody, for, a, range, of, legitimate, and, illegitimate, reasons, such, as, isolating, them, from, the, enemy, combatants, still, in, the, field, releasing, and, repatriating, them, in, an, orderly, manner, after, hostilities, demonstrating, military, victory, punishing, them, prosecuting, them, for, war, crimes, exploiting, them, for, their, labour, recruiting, or, even, conscripting, them, as, their, own, combatants, collecting, military, and, political, intelligence, from, them, or, indoctrinating, them, in, new, political, or, religious, beliefs, for, a, large, part, of, human, history, prisoners, of, war, would, most, often, be, either, slaughtered, or, enslaved, early, roman, gladiators, could, be, prisoners, of, war, categorised, according, to, their, ethnic, roots, as, samnites, thracians, and, gauls, galli, homer, s, iliad, describes, trojan, and, greek, soldiers, offering, rewards, of, wealth, to, opposing, forces, who, have, defeated, them, on, the, battlefield, in, exchange, for, mercy, but, their, offers, are, not, always, accepted, see, lycaon, for, example, typically, victors, made, little, distinction, between, enemy, combatants, and, enemy, civilians, although, they, were, more, likely, to, spare, women, and, children, sometimes, the, purpose, of, a, battle, if, not, of, a, war, was, to, capture, women, a, practice, known, as, raptio, the, rape, of, the, sabines, involved, according, to, tradition, a, large, mass, abduction, by, the, founders, of, rome, typically, women, had, no, rights, and, were, held, legally, as, chattels, in, the, fourth, century, ad, bishop, acacius, of, amida, touched, by, the, plight, of, persian, prisoners, captured, in, a, recent, war, with, the, greek, empire, who, were, held, in, his, town, under, appalling, conditions, and, destined, for, a, life, of, slavery, took, the, initiative, in, ransoming, them, by, selling, his, church, s, precious, gold, and, silver, vessels, and, letting, them, return, to, their, country, for, this, he, was, eventually, canonised, according, to, legend, during, childeric, s, siege, and, blockade, of, paris, in, 464, the, nun, genevi, ve, later, canonised, as, the, city, s, patron, saint, pleaded, with, the, frankish, king, for, the, welfare, of, prisoners, of, war, and, met, with, a, favourable, response, later, clovis, i, r, 481, 511, liberated, captives, after, genevieve, urged, him, to, do, so, king, henry, v, s, english, army, killed, many, french, prisoners, of, war, after, the, battle, of, agincourt, in, 1415, this, was, done, in, retaliation, for, the, french, killing, of, the, boys, and, other, non, combatants, handling, the, baggage, and, equipment, of, the, army, and, because, the, french, were, attacking, again, and, henry, was, afraid, that, they, would, break, through, and, free, the, prisoners, who, would, rejoin, the, fight, against, the, english, in, the, later, middle, ages, a, number, of, religious, wars, aimed, to, not, only, defeat, but, also, to, eliminate, enemies, authorities, in, christian, europe, often, considered, the, extermination, of, heretics, and, heathens, desirable, examples, of, such, wars, include, the, 13th, century, albigensian, crusade, in, languedoc, and, the, northern, crusades, in, the, baltic, region, when, asked, by, a, crusader, how, to, distinguish, between, the, catholics, and, cathars, following, the, projected, capture, 1209, of, the, city, of, b, ziers, the, papal, legate, arnaud, amalric, allegedly, replied, kill, them, all, god, will, know, his, own, likewise, the, inhabitants, of, conquered, cities, were, frequently, massacred, during, christians, crusades, against, muslims, in, the, 11th, and, 12th, centuries, noblemen, could, hope, to, be, ransomed, their, families, would, have, to, send, to, their, captors, large, sums, of, wealth, commensurate, with, the, social, status, of, the, captive, feudal, japan, had, no, custom, of, ransoming, prisoners, of, war, who, could, expect, for, the, most, part, summary, execution, in, the, 13th, century, the, expanding, mongol, empire, famously, distinguished, between, cities, or, towns, that, surrendered, where, the, population, was, spared, but, required, to, support, the, conquering, mongol, army, and, those, that, resisted, in, which, case, the, city, was, ransacked, and, destroyed, and, all, the, population, killed, in, termez, on, the, oxus, all, the, people, both, men, and, women, were, driven, out, onto, the, plain, and, divided, in, accordance, with, their, usual, custom, then, they, were, all, slain, the, aztecs, warred, constantly, with, neighbouring, tribes, and, groups, aiming, to, collect, live, prisoners, for, sacrifice, for, the, re, consecration, of, great, pyramid, of, tenochtitlan, in, 1487, between, 10, 000, and, 80, 400, persons, were, sacrificed, during, the, early, muslim, conquests, of, 622, 750, muslims, routinely, captured, large, numbers, of, prisoners, aside, from, those, who, converted, most, were, ransomed, or, enslaved, christians, captured, during, the, crusades, were, usually, either, killed, or, sold, into, slavery, if, they, could, not, pay, a, ransom, during, his, lifetime, c, 570, 632, muhammad, made, it, the, responsibility, of, the, islamic, government, to, provide, food, and, clothing, on, a, reasonable, basis, to, captives, regardless, of, their, religion, however, if, the, prisoners, were, in, the, custody, of, a, person, then, the, responsibility, was, on, the, individual, on, certain, occasions, where, muhammad, felt, the, enemy, had, broken, a, treaty, with, the, muslims, he, endorsed, the, mass, execution, of, male, prisoners, who, participated, in, battles, as, in, the, case, of, the, banu, qurayza, in, 627, the, muslims, divided, up, the, females, and, children, of, those, executed, as, ghanima, spoils, of, war, in, europe, the, treatment, of, prisoners, of, war, became, increasingly, centralised, in, the, time, period, between, the, 16th, and, late, 18th, century, whereas, prisoners, of, war, had, previously, been, regarded, as, the, private, property, of, the, captor, captured, enemy, soldiers, became, increasingly, regarded, as, the, property, of, the, state, the, european, states, strove, to, exert, increasing, control, over, all, stages, of, captivity, from, the, question, of, who, would, be, attributed, the, status, of, prisoner, of, war, to, their, eventual, release, the, act, of, surrender, was, regulated, so, that, it, ideally, should, be, legitimised, by, officers, who, negotiated, the, surrender, of, their, whole, unit, soldiers, whose, style, of, fighting, did, not, conform, to, the, battle, line, tactics, of, regular, european, armies, such, as, cossacks, and, croats, were, often, denied, the, status, of, prisoners, of, war, in, line, with, this, development, the, treatment, of, prisoners, of, war, became, increasingly, regulated, in, international, treaties, particularly, in, the, form, of, the, so, called, cartel, system, which, regulated, how, the, exchange, of, prisoners, would, be, carried, out, between, warring, states, another, such, treaty, was, the, 1648, peace, of, westphalia, which, ended, the, thirty, years, war, this, treaty, established, the, rule, that, prisoners, of, war, should, be, released, without, ransom, at, the, end, of, hostilities, and, that, they, should, be, allowed, to, return, to, their, homelands, there, also, evolved, the, right, of, parole, french, for, discourse, in, which, a, captured, officer, surrendered, his, sword, and, gave, his, word, as, a, gentleman, in, exchange, for, privileges, if, he, swore, not, to, escape, he, could, gain, better, accommodations, and, the, freedom, of, the, prison, if, he, swore, to, cease, hostilities, against, the, nation, who, hold, him, captive, he, could, be, repatriated, or, exchanged, but, could, not, serve, against, his, former, captors, in, a, military, capacity, early, historical, narratives, of, captured, european, settlers, including, perspectives, of, literate, women, captured, by, the, indigenous, peoples, of, north, america, exist, in, some, number, the, writings, of, mary, rowlandson, captured, in, the, chaotic, fighting, of, king, philip, s, war, are, an, example, such, narratives, enjoyed, some, popularity, spawning, a, genre, of, the, captivity, narrative, and, had, lasting, influence, on, the, body, of, early, american, literature, most, notably, through, the, legacy, of, james, fenimore, cooper, s, the, last, of, the, mohicans, some, native, americans, continued, to, capture, europeans, and, use, them, both, as, labourers, and, bargaining, chips, into, the, 19th, century, see, for, example, john, r, jewitt, a, sailor, who, wrote, a, memoir, about, his, years, as, a, captive, of, the, nootka, people, on, the, pacific, northwest, coast, from, 1802, to, 1805, the, earliest, known, purpose, built, prisoner, of, war, camp, was, established, at, norman, cross, in, huntingdonshire, england, in, 1797, to, house, the, increasing, number, of, prisoners, from, the, french, revolutionary, wars, and, the, napoleonic, wars, the, average, prison, population, was, about, 5, 500, men, the, lowest, number, recorded, was, 3, 300, in, october, 1804, and, 6, 272, on, 10, april, 1810, was, the, highest, number, of, prisoners, recorded, in, any, official, document, norman, cross, prison, was, intended, to, be, a, model, depot, providing, the, most, humane, treatment, of, prisoners, of, war, the, british, government, went, to, great, lengths, to, provide, food, of, a, quality, at, least, equal, to, that, available, to, locals, the, senior, officer, from, each, quadrangle, was, permitted, to, inspect, the, food, as, it, was, delivered, to, the, prison, to, ensure, it, was, of, sufficient, quality, despite, the, generous, supply, and, quality, of, food, some, prisoners, died, of, starvation, after, gambling, away, their, rations, most, of, the, men, held, in, the, prison, were, low, ranking, soldiers, and, sailors, including, midshipmen, and, junior, officers, with, a, small, number, of, privateers, about, 100, senior, officers, and, some, civilians, of, good, social, standing, mainly, passengers, on, captured, ships, and, the, wives, of, some, officers, were, given, parole, outside, the, prison, mainly, in, peterborough, although, some, further, afield, they, were, afforded, the, courtesy, of, their, rank, within, english, society, during, the, battle, of, leipzig, both, sides, used, the, city, s, cemetery, as, a, lazaret, and, prisoner, camp, for, around, 6, 000, pows, who, lived, in, the, burial, vaults, and, used, the, coffins, for, firewood, food, was, scarce, and, prisoners, resorted, to, eating, horses, cats, dogs, or, even, human, flesh, the, bad, conditions, inside, the, graveyard, contributed, to, a, city, wide, epidemic, after, the, battle, the, extensive, period, of, conflict, during, the, american, revolutionary, war, and, napoleonic, wars, 1793, 1815, followed, by, the, anglo, american, war, of, 1812, led, to, the, emergence, of, a, cartel, system, for, the, exchange, of, prisoners, even, while, the, belligerents, were, at, war, a, cartel, was, usually, arranged, by, the, respective, armed, service, for, the, exchange, of, like, ranked, personnel, the, aim, was, to, achieve, a, reduction, in, the, number, of, prisoners, held, while, at, the, same, time, alleviating, shortages, of, skilled, personnel, in, the, home, country, at, the, start, of, the, american, civil, war, a, system, of, paroles, operated, captives, agreed, not, to, fight, until, they, were, officially, exchanged, meanwhile, they, were, held, in, camps, run, by, their, own, army, where, they, were, paid, but, not, allowed, to, perform, any, military, duties, the, system, of, exchanges, collapsed, in, 1863, when, the, confederacy, refused, to, exchange, black, prisoners, in, the, late, summer, of, 1864, a, year, after, the, dix, hill, cartel, was, suspended, confederate, officials, approached, union, general, benjamin, butler, union, commissioner, of, exchange, about, resuming, the, cartel, and, including, the, black, prisoners, butler, contacted, grant, for, guidance, on, the, issue, and, grant, responded, to, butler, on, 18, august, 1864, with, his, now, famous, statement, he, rejected, the, offer, stating, in, essence, that, the, union, could, afford, to, leave, their, men, in, captivity, the, confederacy, could, not, after, that, about, 56, 000, of, the, 409, 000, pows, died, in, prisons, during, the, american, civil, war, accounting, for, nearly, 10, of, the, conflict, s, fatalities, of, the, 45, 000, union, prisoners, of, war, confined, in, camp, sumter, located, near, andersonville, georgia, 13, 000, 28, died, at, camp, douglas, in, chicago, illinois, 10, of, its, confederate, prisoners, died, during, one, cold, winter, month, and, elmira, prison, in, new, york, state, with, a, death, rate, of, 25, 2, 963, nearly, equalled, that, of, andersonville, during, the, 19th, century, there, were, increased, efforts, to, improve, the, treatment, and, processing, of, prisoners, as, a, result, of, these, emerging, conventions, a, number, of, international, conferences, were, held, starting, with, the, brussels, conference, of, 1874, with, nations, agreeing, that, it, was, necessary, to, prevent, inhumane, treatment, of, prisoners, and, the, use, of, weapons, causing, unnecessary, harm, although, no, agreements, were, immediately, ratified, by, the, participating, nations, work, was, continued, that, resulted, in, new, conventions, being, adopted, and, becoming, recognised, as, international, law, that, specified, that, prisoners, of, war, be, treated, humanely, and, diplomatically, chapter, ii, of, the, annex, to, the, 1907, hague, convention, iv, the, laws, and, customs, of, war, on, land, covered, the, treatment, of, prisoners, of, war, in, detail, these, provisions, were, further, expanded, in, the, 1929, geneva, convention, on, the, prisoners, of, war, and, were, largely, revised, in, the, third, geneva, convention, in, 1949, article, 4, of, the, third, geneva, convention, protects, captured, military, personnel, some, guerrilla, fighters, and, certain, civilians, it, applies, from, the, moment, a, prisoner, is, captured, until, his, or, her, release, or, repatriation, under, the, 1949, geneva, conventions, pows, acquires, the, status, of, protected, persons, meaning, it, is, a, war, crime, by, the, detaining, power, to, deprive, the, rights, afforded, to, them, by, the, third, convention, s, provisions, article, 17, of, the, third, geneva, convention, states, that, pows, can, only, be, required, to, give, their, name, date, of, birth, rank, and, service, number, if, applicable, the, icrc, has, a, special, role, to, play, with, regards, to, international, humanitarian, law, in, restoring, and, maintaining, family, contact, in, times, of, war, in, particular, concerning, the, right, of, prisoners, of, war, and, internees, to, send, and, receive, letters, and, cards, geneva, convention, gc, iii, art, 71, and, gc, iv, art, 107, however, nations, vary, in, their, dedication, to, following, these, laws, and, historically, the, treatment, of, pows, has, varied, greatly, during, world, war, ii, imperial, japan, and, nazi, germany, towards, soviet, pows, and, western, allied, commandos, were, notorious, for, atrocities, against, prisoners, of, war, the, german, military, used, the, soviet, union, s, refusal, to, sign, the, geneva, convention, as, a, reason, for, not, providing, the, necessities, of, life, to, soviet, pows, and, the, soviets, also, used, axis, prisoners, as, forced, labour, the, germans, also, routinely, executed, allied, commandos, captured, behind, german, lines, per, the, commando, order, to, be, entitled, to, prisoner, of, war, status, captured, persons, must, be, lawful, combatants, entitled, to, combatant, s, privilege, which, gives, them, immunity, from, punishment, for, crimes, constituting, lawful, acts, of, war, such, as, killing, enemy, combatants, to, qualify, under, the, third, geneva, convention, a, combatant, must, be, part, of, a, chain, of, command, wear, a, fixed, distinctive, marking, visible, from, a, distance, bear, arms, openly, and, have, conducted, military, operations, according, to, the, laws, and, customs, of, war, the, convention, recognises, a, few, other, groups, as, well, such, as, nhabitants, of, a, non, occupied, territory, who, on, the, approach, of, the, enemy, spontaneously, take, up, arms, to, resist, the, invading, forces, without, having, had, time, to, form, themselves, into, regular, armed, units, thus, uniforms, and, badges, are, important, in, determining, prisoner, of, war, status, under, the, third, geneva, convention, under, additional, protocol, i, the, requirement, of, a, distinctive, marking, is, no, longer, included, francs, tireurs, militias, insurgents, terrorists, saboteurs, mercenaries, and, spies, generally, do, not, qualify, because, they, do, not, fulfill, the, criteria, of, additional, protocol, i, therefore, they, fall, under, the, category, of, unlawful, combatants, or, more, properly, they, are, not, combatants, captured, soldiers, who, do, not, get, prisoner, of, war, status, are, still, protected, like, civilians, under, the, fourth, geneva, convention, the, criteria, are, applied, primarily, to, international, armed, conflicts, the, application, of, prisoner, of, war, status, in, non, international, armed, conflicts, like, civil, wars, is, guided, by, additional, protocol, ii, but, insurgents, are, often, treated, as, traitors, terrorists, or, criminals, by, government, forces, and, are, sometimes, executed, on, spot, or, tortured, however, in, the, american, civil, war, both, sides, treated, captured, troops, as, pows, presumably, out, of, reciprocity, although, the, union, regarded, confederate, personnel, as, separatist, rebels, however, guerrillas, and, other, irregular, combatants, generally, cannot, expect, to, receive, benefits, from, both, civilian, and, military, status, simultaneously, under, the, third, geneva, convention, prisoners, of, war, pow, must, be, in, addition, if, wounded, or, sick, on, the, battlefield, the, prisoner, will, receive, help, from, the, international, committee, of, the, red, cross, when, a, country, is, responsible, for, breaches, of, prisoner, of, war, rights, those, accountable, will, be, punished, accordingly, an, example, of, this, is, the, nuremberg, and, tokyo, trials, german, and, japanese, military, commanders, were, prosecuted, for, preparing, and, initiating, a, war, of, aggression, murder, ill, treatment, and, deportation, of, individuals, and, genocide, during, world, war, ii, most, were, executed, or, sentenced, to, life, in, prison, for, their, crimes, the, united, states, military, code, of, conduct, was, promulgated, in, 1955, via, executive, order, 10631, under, president, dwight, d, eisenhower, to, serve, as, a, moral, code, for, united, states, service, members, who, have, been, taken, prisoner, it, was, created, primarily, in, response, to, the, breakdown, of, leadership, and, organisation, specifically, when, u, s, forces, were, pows, during, the, korean, war, when, a, military, member, is, taken, prisoner, the, code, of, conduct, reminds, them, that, the, chain, of, command, is, still, in, effect, the, highest, ranking, service, member, eligible, for, command, regardless, of, service, branch, is, in, command, and, requires, them, to, support, their, leadership, the, code, of, conduct, also, requires, service, members, to, resist, giving, information, to, the, enemy, beyond, identifying, themselves, that, is, name, rank, serial, number, receiving, special, favours, or, parole, or, otherwise, providing, their, enemy, captors, aid, and, comfort, since, the, vietnam, war, the, official, u, s, military, term, for, enemy, pows, is, epw, enemy, prisoner, of, war, this, name, change, was, introduced, in, order, to, distinguish, between, enemy, and, u, s, captives, in, 2000, the, u, s, military, replaced, the, designation, prisoner, of, war, for, captured, american, personnel, with, missing, captured, a, january, 2008, directive, states, that, the, reasoning, behind, this, is, since, prisoner, of, war, is, the, international, legal, recognised, status, for, such, people, there, is, no, need, for, any, individual, country, to, follow, suit, this, change, remains, relatively, unknown, even, among, experts, in, the, field, and, prisoner, of, war, remains, widely, used, in, the, pentagon, which, has, a, pow, missing, personnel, office, and, awards, the, prisoner, of, war, medal, during, world, war, i, about, eight, million, men, surrendered, and, were, held, in, pow, camps, until, the, war, ended, all, nations, pledged, to, follow, the, hague, rules, on, fair, treatment, of, prisoners, of, war, and, in, general, the, pows, had, a, much, higher, survival, rate, than, their, peers, who, were, not, captured, individual, surrenders, were, uncommon, usually, a, large, unit, surrendered, all, its, men, at, tannenberg, 92, 000, russians, surrendered, during, the, battle, when, the, besieged, garrison, of, kaunas, surrendered, in, 1915, 20, 000, russians, became, prisoners, over, half, the, russian, losses, were, prisoners, as, a, proportion, of, those, captured, wounded, or, killed, about, 3, 3, million, men, became, prisoners, the, german, empire, held, 2, 5, million, prisoners, russia, held, 2, 9, million, and, britain, and, france, held, about, 720, 000, mostly, gained, in, the, period, just, before, the, armistice, in, 1918, the, us, held, 48, 000, the, most, dangerous, moment, for, pows, was, the, act, of, surrender, when, helpless, soldiers, were, sometimes, killed, or, mistakenly, shot, down, once, prisoners, reached, a, pow, camp, conditions, were, better, and, often, much, better, than, in, world, war, ii, thanks, in, part, to, the, efforts, of, the, international, red, cross, and, inspections, by, neutral, nations, there, was, much, harsh, treatment, of, pows, in, germany, as, recorded, by, the, american, ambassador, prior, to, america, s, entry, into, the, war, james, w, gerard, who, published, his, findings, in, my, four, years, in, germany, even, worse, conditions, are, reported, in, the, book, escape, of, a, princess, pat, by, the, canadian, george, pearson, it, was, particularly, bad, in, russia, where, starvation, was, common, for, prisoners, and, civilians, alike, a, quarter, of, the, over, 2, million, pows, held, there, died, nearly, 375, 000, of, the, 500, 000, austro, hungarian, prisoners, of, war, taken, by, russians, perished, in, siberia, from, smallpox, and, typhus, in, germany, food, was, short, but, only, 5, per, cent, died, the, ottoman, empire, often, treated, prisoners, of, war, poorly, some, 11, 800, british, soldiers, most, from, the, british, indian, army, became, prisoners, after, the, five, month, siege, of, kut, in, mesopotamia, in, april, 1916, many, were, weak, and, starved, when, they, surrendered, and, 4, 250, died, in, captivity, during, the, sinai, and, palestine, campaign, 217, australian, and, unknown, numbers, of, british, new, zealand, and, indian, soldiers, were, captured, by, ottoman, forces, about, 50, per, cent, of, the, australian, prisoners, were, light, horsemen, including, 48, missing, believed, captured, on, 1, may, 1918, in, the, jordan, valley, australian, flying, corps, pilots, and, observers, were, captured, in, the, sinai, peninsula, palestine, and, the, levant, one, third, of, all, australian, prisoners, were, captured, on, gallipoli, including, the, crew, of, the, submarine, ae2, which, made, a, passage, through, the, dardanelles, in, 1915, forced, marches, and, crowded, railway, journeys, preceded, years, in, camps, where, disease, poor, diet, and, inadequate, medical, facilities, prevailed, about, 25, per, cent, of, other, ranks, died, many, from, malnutrition, while, only, one, officer, died, the, most, curious, case, came, in, russia, where, the, czechoslovak, legion, of, czechoslovak, prisoners, from, the, austro, hungarian, army, who, were, released, and, armed, to, fight, on, the, side, of, the, entente, who, briefly, served, as, a, military, and, diplomatic, force, during, the, russian, civil, war, at, the, end, of, the, war, in, 1918, there, were, believed, to, be, 140, 000, british, prisoners, of, war, in, germany, including, thousands, of, internees, held, in, neutral, switzerland, the, first, british, prisoners, were, released, and, reached, calais, on, 15, november, plans, were, made, for, them, to, be, sent, via, dunkirk, to, dover, and, a, large, reception, camp, was, established, at, dover, capable, of, housing, 40, 000, men, which, could, later, be, used, for, demobilisation, on, 13, december, 1918, the, armistice, was, extended, and, the, allies, reported, that, by, 9, december, 264, 000, prisoners, had, been, repatriated, a, very, large, number, of, these, had, been, released, en, masse, and, sent, across, allied, lines, without, any, food, or, shelter, this, created, difficulties, for, the, receiving, allies, and, many, ex, prisoners, died, from, exhaustion, the, released, pows, were, met, by, cavalry, troops, and, sent, back, through, the, lines, in, lorries, to, reception, centres, where, they, were, refitted, with,

more, to, enjoy, the, happiness, of, a, home, to, see, good, days, among, those, who, anxiously, look, for, your, return, while, the, allied, prisoners, were, sent, home, at, the, end, of, the, war, the, same, treatment, was, not, granted, to, central, powers, prisoners, of, the, allies, and, russia, many, of, whom, had, to, serve, as, forced, labour, e, g, in, france, until, 1920, they, were, released, after, many, approaches, by, the, icrc, to, the, allied, supreme, council, historian, niall, ferguson, in, addition, to, figures, from, keith, lowe, tabulated, the, total, death, rate, for,

accordance, with, international, agreements, including, provisions, of, the, hague, conventions, either, during, the, second, sino, japanese, war, or, during, the, pacific, war, because, the, japanese, viewed, surrender, as, dishonorable, moreover, according, to, a, directive, ratified, on, 5, august, 1937, by, emperor, hirohito, the, constraints, of, the, hague, conventions, were, explicitly, removed, on, chinese, prisoners, of, war, prisoners, of, war, from, china, the, united, states, australia, britain, canada, india, the, netherlands, new, zealand, the, philippines, and,

583, prisoners, from, the, united, kingdom, 28, 500, from, the, netherlands, and, 14, 473, from, the, united, states, were, released, after, the, surrender, of, japan, the, number, for, the, chinese,

the, end, of, the, war, allowing, local, commanders, to, kill, remaining, pows, without, formal, orders, from, tokyo, no, direct, access, to, the, pows, was, provided, to, the, international, red, cross, escapes, among, caucasian, prisoners, were, almost, impossible, because, of, the, difficulty, of, hiding, in, asiatic, societies, allied, pow, camps, and, ship, transports, became, accidental, targets, of, allied, attacks, the, number, of, deaths, which, occurred, when, japanese, hell, ships, unmarked, transport, ships, in, which, pows, were, transported, in, harsh, conditions, were, attacked, by, u, s, navy, submarines, was, particularly, high, gavan, daws, has, calculated, that, of, all, pows, who, died, in, the, pacific, war, one, in, three, was, killed, on, the, water, by, friendly, fire, daws, states, that, 10, 800, of, the, 50, 000, pows, shipped, by, the, japanese, were, killed, at, sea, while, donald, l, miller, states, that, approximately, 21, 000, allied, pows, died, at, sea, about, 19, 000, of, them, killed, by, friendly, fire, life, in, the, pow, camps, was, recorded, at, great, risk, to, themselves, by, artists, such, as, jack, bridger, chalker, philip, meninsky, ashley, george, old, and, ronald, searle, human, hair, was, often, used, for, brushes, plant, juices, and, blood, for, paint, toilet, paper, as, the, canvas, some, of, their, works, were, used, as, evidence, in, the, trials, of, japanese, war, criminals, female, prisoners, detainees, at, changi, prison, in, singapore, recorded, their, ordeal, in, seemingly, harmless, prison, quilt, embroidery, after, the, french, armies, surrendered, in, summer, 1940, germany, seized, two, million, french, prisoners, of, war, and, sent, them, to, camps, in, germany, about, one, third, were, released, on, various, terms, of, the, remainder, the, officers, and, non, commissioned, officers, were, kept, in, camps, and, did, not, work, the, privates, were, sent, out, to, work, about, half, of, them, worked, for, german, agriculture, where, food, supplies, were, adequate, and, controls, were, lenient, the, others, worked, in, factories, or, mines, where, conditions, were, much, harsher, germany, and, italy, generally, treated, prisoners, from, the, british, empire, and, commonwealth, france, the, u, s, and, other, western, allies, in, accordance, with, the, geneva, convention, which, had, been, signed, by, these, countries, consequently, western, allied, officers, were, not, usually, made, to, work, and, some, personnel, of, lower, rank, were, usually, compensated, or, not, required, to, work, either, the, main, complaints, of, western, allied, prisoners, of, war, in, german, pow, camps, especially, during, the, last, two, years, of, the, war, concerned, shortages, of, food, only, a, small, proportion, of, western, allied, pows, who, were, jews, or, whom, the, nazis, believed, to, be, jewish, were, killed, as, part, of, the, holocaust, or, were, subjected, to, other, antisemitic, policies, for, example, major, yitzhak, ben, aharon, a, palestinian, jew, who, had, enlisted, in, the, british, army, and, who, was, captured, by, the, germans, in, greece, in, 1941, experienced, four, years, of, captivity, under, entirely, normal, conditions, for, pows, a, small, number, of, allied, personnel, were, sent, to, concentration, camps, for, a, variety, of, reasons, including, being, jewish, as, the, us, historian, joseph, robert, white, put, it, an, important, exception, is, the, sub, camp, for, u, s, pows, at, berga, an, der, elster, officially, called, arbeitskommando, 625, berga, was, the, deadliest, work, detachment, for, american, captives, in, germany, 73, men, who, participated, or, 21, percent, of, the, detachment, perished, in, two, months, 80, of, the, 350, pows, were, jews, another, well, known, example, was, a, group, of, 168, australian, british, canadian, new, zealand, and, us, aviators, who, were, held, for, two, months, at, buchenwald, concentration, camp, two, of, the, pows, died, at, buchenwald, two, possible, reasons, have, been, suggested, for, this, incident, german, authorities, wanted, to, make, an, example, of, terrorflieger, terrorist, aviators, or, these, aircrews, were, classified, as, spies, because, they, had, been, disguised, as, civilians, or, enemy, soldiers, when, they, were, apprehended, information, on, conditions, in, the, stalags, is, contradictory, depending, on, the, source, some, american, pows, claimed, the, germans, were, victims, of, circumstance, and, did, the, best, they, could, while, others, accused, their, captors, of, brutalities, and, forced, labour, in, any, case, the, prison, camps, were, miserable, places, where, food, rations, were, meager, and, conditions, squalid, one, american, admitted, the, only, difference, between, the, stalags, and, concentration, camps, was, that, we, weren, t, gassed, or, shot, in, the, former, i, do, not, recall, a, single, act, of, compassion, or, mercy, on, the, part, of, the, germans, typical, meals, consisted, of, a, bread, slice, and, watery, potato, soup, which, was, still, more, substantial, than, what, soviet, pows, or, concentration, camp, inmates, received, another, prisoner, stated, that, the, german, plan, was, to, keep, us, alive, yet, weakened, enough, that, we, wouldn, t, attempt, escape, as, the, red, army, approached, some, pow, camps, in, early, 1945, german, guards, forced, western, allied, pows, to, walk, long, distances, towards, central, germany, often, in, extreme, winter, weather, conditions, it, is, estimated, that, out, of, 257, 000, pows, about, 80, 000, were, subject, to, such, marches, and, up, to, 3, 500, of, them, died, as, a, result, in, september, 1943, after, the, armistice, italian, officers, and, soldiers, in, many, places, waiting, for, orders, were, arrested, by, germans, and, italian, fascists, and, taken, to, internment, camps, in, germany, or, eastern, europe, where, they, were, held, for, the, duration, of, the, war, the, international, red, cross, could, do, nothing, for, them, as, they, were, not, regarded, as, pows, but, the, prisoners, held, the, status, of, military, internees, treatment, of, the, prisoners, was, generally, poor, the, author, giovannino, guareschi, was, among, those, interned, and, wrote, about, this, time, in, his, life, the, book, was, translated, and, published, as, my, secret, diary, he, wrote, about, semi, starvation, the, casual, murder, of, individual, prisoners, by, guards, and, how, when, they, were, released, now, from, a, german, camp, they, found, a, deserted, german, town, filled, with, foodstuffs, that, they, with, other, released, prisoners, ate, it, is, estimated, that, of, the, 700, 000, italians, taken, prisoner, by, the, germans, around, 40, 000, died, in, detention, and, more, than, 13, 000, lost, their, lives, during, the, transportation, from, the, greek, islands, to, the, mainland, between, 1941, and, 1945, the, axis, powers, took, about, 5, 7, million, soviet, prisoners, about, one, million, of, them, were, released, during, the, war, in, that, their, status, changed, but, they, remained, under, german, authority, a, little, over, 500, 000, either, escaped, or, were, liberated, by, the, red, army, some, 930, 000, more, were, found, alive, in, camps, after, the, war, the, remaining, 3, 3, million, prisoners, 57, 5, of, the, total, captured, died, during, their, captivity, between, the, launching, of, operation, barbarossa, in, the, summer, of, 1941, and, the, following, spring, 2, 8, million, of, the, 3, 2, million, soviet, prisoners, taken, died, while, in, german, hands, according, to, russian, military, historian, general, grigoriy, krivosheyev, the, axis, powers, took, 4, 6, million, soviet, prisoners, of, whom, 1, 8, million, were, found, alive, in, camps, after, the, war, and, 318, 770, were, released, by, the, axis, during, the, war, and, were, then, drafted, into, the, soviet, armed, forces, again, by, comparison, 8, 348, western, allied, prisoners, died, in, german, camps, during, 1939, 45, 3, 5, of, the, 232, 000, total, the, germans, officially, justified, their, policy, on, the, grounds, that, the, soviet, union, had, not, signed, the, geneva, convention, legally, however, under, article, 82, of, the, geneva, convention, signatory, countries, had, to, give, pows, of, all, signatory, and, non, signatory, countries, the, rights, assigned, by, the, convention, shortly, after, the, german, invasion, in, 1941, the, ussr, made, berlin, an, offer, of, a, reciprocal, adherence, to, the, hague, conventions, third, reich, officials, left, the, soviet, note, unanswered, between, 1941, and, 1944, 91, 060, soviet, prisoners, of, war, were, captured, by, the, romanian, army, until, august, 1944, 5, 221, soviet, prisoners, died, in, romanian, camps, mainly, to, disease, during, winter, the, pows, were, treated, according, to, the, 1929, geneva, convention, which, was, ratified, by, romania, on, 15, september, 1931, initially, the, prisoners, were, held, in, five, pow, camps, in, vulcan, g, e, ti, dr, g, ani, alexandria, and, slobozia, by, 1942, the, number, reached, 12, camps, of, which, 10, were, in, romania, and, two, in, transnistria, at, tiraspol, and, odesa, as, the, frontline, moved, further, away, the, captured, prisoners, were, given, to, german, pow, camps, and, then, they, were, transferred, to, romanian, ones, after, requests, from, the, romanian, authorities, in, the, winter, of, 1941, 1942, the, conditions, of, the, pow, camps, were, unsatisfactory, leading, to, the, deaths, of, prisoners, due, to, various, diseases, the, conditions, were, improved, in, 1942, when, by, order, of, marshal, ion, antonescu, the, organisations, leading, the, camps, were, to, permanently, control, how, the, prisoners, were, accommodated, cared, for, fed, and, used, due, to, some, problems, that, arose, with, the, food, allowance, in, 1942, it, was, decided, that, the, prisoners, were, to, be, fed, like, the, romanian, troops, with, an, allocated, 30, lei, per, soldier, per, day, in, accordance, with, article, 27, of, the, geneva, convention, the, pows, were, used, in, various, productive, activities, in, return, for, providing, work, the, prisoners, were, granted, payment, and, accommodation, as, well, as, free, time, for, cleaning, rest, and, religious, or, other, activities, by, their, employers, according, to, the, contracts, signed, with, the, commanders, of, the, prison, camps, the, main, workplaces, for, prisoners, were, in, agriculture, and, industrial, enterprises, but, also, in, forestry, civil, works, and, in, service, of, the, pow, camps, for, correspondence, with, their, families, the, prisoners, were, provided, with, postcards, however, most, of, these, were, not, used, as, the, pows, feared, reprisals, from, the, soviet, authorities, upon, learning, that, they, were, prisoners, in, romania, the, punishment, of, pows, in, the, romanian, camps, was, applied, following, the, regulations, of, the, romanian, army, executions, by, firing, squad, were, few, the, escapees, who, were, caught, and, did, not, commit, any, acts, of, sabotage, or, espionage, were, tried, by, court, martial, and, sentenced, to, prison, terms, from, 3, 6, months, to, several, years, after, 23, august, 1944, the, soviet, pows, were, handed, over, to, the, soviet, headquarters, the, first, americans, were, captured, in, romania, following, operation,

conditions, at, the, camp, earned, it, the, nickname, gilded, cage, with, the, prisoners, describing, it, as, probably, the, best, prison, camp, in, the, world, the, treatment, of, the, allied, pows, was, overlooked, by, princess, catherine, caradja, who, was, nicknamed, the, angel, of, ploie, ti, by, the, airmen, in, the, spring, of, 1944, with, the, increasing, number, of, american, and, british, prisoners, due, to, the, restarted, air, campaign, a, new, camp, was, set, up, in, bucharest, camp, no, 13, from, bucharest, was, initially, located, within, the, barracks, of, the, 6th, guard, regiment, mihai, viteazul, in, a, frequently, bombed, area, it, was, later, moved, to, the, normal, school, on, st, ecaterina, street, in, june, 1944, the, non, commissioned, officers, were,

approved, the, transfer, of, 896, pows, to, the, barracks, of, the, 4th, v, n, tori, regiment, all, western, allied, pows, were, evacuated, to, italy, during, operation, reunion, from, 31, august, to, 3, september, according, to, some, sources, the, soviets, captured, 3, 5, million, axis, servicemen, excluding, japanese, of, whom, more, than, a, million, died, one, specific, example, is, that, of, the, german, pows, after, the, battle, of, stalingrad, where, the, soviets, captured, 91, 000, german, troops, in, total, completely, exhausted, starving, and, sick, of, whom, only, 5, 000, survived, the, captivity, german, soldiers, were, kept, as, forced, labour, for, many, years, after, the, war, the, last, german, pows, like, erich, hartmann, the, highest, scoring, fighter, ace, in, the, history, of, aerial, warfare, who, had, been, declared, guilty, of, war, crimes, but, without, due, process, were, not, released, by, the, soviets, until, 1955, two, years, after, stalin, died, as, a, result, of, the, soviet, invasion, of, poland, in, 1939, hundreds, of, thousands, of, polish, soldiers, became, prisoners, of, war, in, the, soviet, union, thousands, were, executed, over, 20, 000, polish, military, personnel, and, civilians, perished, in, the, katyn, massacre, out, of, anders, 80, 000, evacuees, from, the, soviet, union, in, the, united, kingdom, only, 310, volunteered, to,

prisoners, of, war, were, captured, by, the, soviet, union, the, prisoners, were, captured, in, manchuria, korea, south, sakhalin, and, the, kuril, islands, then, sent, to, work, as, forced, labour, in, the, soviet, union, and, mongolia, an, estimated, 60, 000, to, 347, 000, of, these, japanese, prisoners, of, war, died, in, captivity, stories, that, circulated, during, the, cold, war, claimed, 23, 000, americans, held, in, german, pow, camps, had, been, seized, by, the, soviets, and, never, been, repatriated, the, claims, had, been, perpetuated, after, the, release, of, people, like, john, h, noble, careful, scholarly, studies, demonstrated, that, this, was, a, myth, based, on, the, misinterpretation, of, a, telegram, about, soviet, prisoners, held, in, italy, during, the, war, the, armies, of, western, allied, nations, such, as, australia, canada, the, uk, and, the, us, were, given, orders, to, treat, axis, prisoners, strictly, in, accordance, with, the, geneva, convention, some, breaches, of, the, convention, took, place, however, according, to, stephen, e, ambrose, of, the, roughly, 1, 000, us, combat, veterans, he, had, interviewed, only, one, admitted, to, shooting, a, prisoner, saying, he, felt, remorse, but, would, do, it, again, however, one, third, of, interviewees, told, him, they, had, seen, fellow, us, troops, kill, german, prisoners, in, britain, german, prisoners, particularly, higher, ranked, officers, were, housed, in, luxurious, buildings, where, listening, devices, were, installed, a, considerable, amount, of, military, intelligence, was, gained, from, eavesdropping, on, what, the, officers, believed, were, private, casual, conversations, much, of, the, listening, was, carried, out, by, german, refugees, in, many, cases, jews, the, work, of, these, refugees, in, contributing, to, the, allied, victory, was, declassified, over, half, a, century, later, in, february, 1944, 59, 7, of, pows, in, america, were, employed, this, relatively, low, percentage, was, due, to, problems, setting, wages, that, would, not, compete, against, those, of, non, prisoners, to, union, opposition, as, well, as, concerns, about, security, sabotage, and, escape, given, national, manpower, shortages, citizens, and, employers, resented, the, idle, prisoners, and, efforts, were, made, to, decentralise, the, camps, and, reduce, security, enough, that, more, prisoners, could, work, by, the, end, of, may, 1944, pow, employment, was, at, 72, 8, and, by, late, april, 1945, it, had, risen, to, 91, 3, the, sector, that, made, the, most, use, of, pow, workers, was, agriculture, there, was, more, demand, than, supply, of, prisoners, throughout, the, war, and, 14, 000, pow, repatriations, were, delayed, in, 1946, so, prisoners, could, be, used, in, the, spring, farming, seasons, mostly, to, thin, and, block, sugar, beets, in, the, west, while, some, in, congress, wanted, to, extend, pow, labour, beyond, june, 1946, president, truman, rejected, this, leading, to, the, end, of, the, program, towards, the, end, of, the, war, in, europe, as, large, numbers, of, axis, soldiers, surrendered, the, us, created, the, designation, of, disarmed, enemy, forces, def, so, as, not, to, treat, prisoners, as, pows, a, lot, of, these, soldiers, were, kept, in, open, fields, in, makeshift, camps, in, the, rhine, valley, rheinwiesenlager, controversy, has, arisen, about, how, eisenhower, managed, these, prisoners, see, other, losses, after, the, surrender, of, germany, in, may, 1945, the, pow, status, of, the, german, prisoners, was, in, many, cases, maintained, and, they, were, for, several, years, used, as, public, labourers, in, countries, such, as, the, uk, and, france, many, died, when, forced, to, clear, minefields, in, countries, such, as, norway, and, france, by, september, 1945, it, was, estimated, by, the, french, authorities, that, two, thousand, prisoners, were, being, maimed, and, killed, each, month, in, accidents, in, 1946, the, uk, held, over, 400, 000, german, pows, many, having, been, transferred, from, pow, camps, in, the, us, and, canada, they, were, employed, as, labourers, to, compensate, for, the, lack, of, manpower, in, britain, as, a, form, of, war, reparation, a, public, debate, ensued, in, the, uk, over, the, treatment, of, german, prisoners, of, war, with, many, in, britain, comparing, the, treatment, to, the, pows, to, slave, labour, in, 1947, the, ministry, of, agriculture, argued, against, repatriation, of, working, german, prisoners, since, by, then, they, made, up, 25, per, cent, of, the, land, workforce, and, it, wanted, to, continue, having, them, work, in, the, uk, until, 1948, the, london, cage, an, mi19, prisoner, of, war, facility, in, london, used, during, and, immediately, after, the, war, to, interrogate, prisoners, before, sending, them, to, prison, camps, was, subject, to, allegations, of, torture, after, the, german, surrender, the, international, red, cross, was, prohibited, from, providing, aid, such, as, food, or, prisoner, visits, to, pow, camps, in, germany, however, after, making, appeals, to, the, allies, in, the, autumn, of, 1945, the, red, cross, was, allowed, to, investigate, the, camps, in, the, british, and, french, occupation, zones, of, germany, as, well, as, providing, relief, to, the, prisoners, held, there, on, 4, february,
