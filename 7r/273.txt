grow, by, 4, 6, in, 2019, and, 4, 8, in, 2020, but, at, the, cost, of, the, release, about, 1, 5, billion, tonnes, of, co, 2, to, the, atmosphere, every, year, that, makes, asean, a, greater, source, of, greenhouse, gas, emissions, than, japan, 1, 3, billion, tonnes, per, year, or, germany, 796, million, tonnes, per, year, it, is, the, only, region, in, the, world, where, coal, is, expected, to, increase, its, share, of, the, energy, mix, according, to, the, international, energy, agency, iea, since, 2000, overall, energy, demand, has, grown, by, more, than, 80, and, the, lion, s, share, of, this, growth, has, been, met, by, a, doubling, in, fossil, fuel, use, oil, is, the, largest, element, in, the, regional, energy, mix, and, coal, largely, for, power, generation, has, been, the, fastest, growing, asean, has, been, criticized, for, not, doing, enough, to, mitigate, climate, change, although, it, is, the, world, s, most, vulnerable, region, in, terms, of, climate, impact, asean, has, many, opportunities, for, renewable, energy, with, solar, and, wind, power, plus, off, river, pumped, hydro, storage, asean, electricity, industry, could, achieve, very, high, penetration,

technology, costs, vietnam, s, experience, in, solar, and, wind, power, development, provides, relevant, implications, for, the, other, asean, countries, the, proposed, asean, power, grid, could, allow, for, renewable, energy, transmission, from, large, producers, like, vietnam, to, others, within, asean, the, asean, has, initiated, its, transition, to, cleaner, energy, sources, this,

to, triple, by, 2050, however, transitioning, energy, sources, requires, significant, resources, southeast, asia, would, need, to, invest, usd, 27, billion, annually, in, renewable, energy, to, achieve, the, target, of, 23, renewables, in, the, primary, energy, supply, by, 2025, nevertheless, this, goal, is, attainable, with, the, implementation, of, appropriate, policies, vietnam, serves, as, a, compelling, example, of, rapid, adoption, of, solar, and, wind, energy, since, 2019, vietnam, has, emerged, as, a, regional, leader, with, solar, and, wind, energy, accounting, for, 13, of, its, electricity, mix, in, 2022, a, remarkable, increase, from, nearly, zero, in, 2017, the, region, requires, international, assistance, to, meet, its, net, zero, emission, targets, phasing, out, coal, remains, a, daunting, task, although, countries, such, as, indonesia, and, vietnam, have, pledged, to, phasing, out, coal, power, by, 2040s, several, high, profile, leaders, such, as, the, head, of, the, indonesian, national, energy, company, pln, darmawan, prasodjo, have, stated, that, the, asean, power, grid, proposal, is, key, to, unlocking, the, potential, for, green, energy, in,

terms, of, employment, rate, tourism, life, expectancy, and, cellular, subscriptions, nestor, tan, head, of, bdo, unibank, inc, said, that, while, some, businesses, see, the, asian, economic,

prepared, for, the, tougher, competition, that, would, result, from, the, integration, in, one, of, its, latest, publications, s, p, said, banks, in, the, country, although, profitable, and, stable, operate, on, a, much, smaller, scale, than, their, counterparts, in, the, region, the, us, chamber, of, commerce, has, highlighted, widespread, concern, that, the, much, anticipated, aec, could, not, be, launched, by, the, 2015, deadline, in, january, 2014, former, asean, secretary, general, rodolfo, c, severino, wrote, while, asean, should, not, be, condemned, for, its, members, failure, to, make, good, on, their, commitments, any, failure, to, deliver, will, likely, lead, to, a, loss, of, credibility, and, could, mean, that, member, states, fall, further, behind, in, the, global,

steel, to, asean, countries, another, challenge, is, the, need, to, compete, with, other, countries, in, the, asean, market, to, export, raw, products, since, the, country, had, mainly, exported, raw, products, the, asian, development, bank, also, has, doubts, about, cambodia, s, ability, to, meet, the, aec, deadline, the, leading, economist, of, adb, jayant, menon, said, that, cambodia, needs, to, speed, up, its, customs, reform, and, to, press, ahead, with, automating, processes, to, reduce, trade, costs, and, minimise, the, opportunities, for, corruption, and, be, ready, for, the, implementation, of, its, national, single, window, by, 2015, despite, an, asean, economic, community, goal, of, significant, economic, integration, as, laid, out, in, the, aec, blueprint, 2025, asean, continues, to, face, challenges, towards, integration, a, report, published, by, the, asian, trade, centre, in, 2019, identified, multiple, sectors, that, face, challenges, towards, integration, due, to, non, tariff, barriers, that, still, exist, in, the, region, the, report, stated, that, the, goals, of, the, aec, 2025, would, not, be, accomplished, if, asean, fails, to, address, the, issues, of, non, tariff, measures, and, eliminate, non, tariff, barriers, in, the, region, asean, is, recognized, by, its, members, to, be, one, of, the, main, forums, to, discuss, security, issues, based, on,

strait, the, increment, of, incidents, during, 2020, have, raised, alerts, in, the, region, as, the, phenomenon, of, piracy, could, be, fostered, by, the, social, consequences, of, the, covid, 19, pandemic, in, their, fourteenth, asean, ministerial, meeting, on, transnational, crime, the, ministers, agreed, that, asean, should, embrace, a, greater, commitment, to, strengthen, the, measures, in, combating, transnational, crime, in, the, context, of, the, pandemic, despite, this, statement, asean, has, not, updated, their, plans, for, combating, piracy, although, member, states, created, and, enforced, the, maritime, security, plan, of, action, 2018, 2020, to, address, the, national, legal, enforcement, capacities, and, creating, a, common, protocol, of, action, to, counter, piracy, allowing, the, region, to, cooperate, for, ensuring, the, security, of, the, pacific, ocean, new, discussions, and, agendas, for, new, measures, has, not, been, enforced, yet, accordingly, this, plan, reinforces, the, necessity, to, secure, the, seas, due, to, the, importance, of, this, region, geographical, and, economically, its, strategic, position, as, the, main, link, between, the, indian, and, the, pacific, ocean, and, the, region, serving, as, the, main, passage, that, connects, middle, east, economies, and, india, with, china, japan, south, korea, and, australia, this, plan, is, mainly, focused, in, three, priorities, in, this, sense, spread, all, over, the, countries, of, southeast, asia, criminal, organizations, with, complex, structures, pose, a, challenge, to, asean, s, coordination, capacity, to, solve, the, problem, despite, the, plans, created, within, its, institutional, framework, although, some, measures, have, been, implemented, by, asean, still, the, complexity, of, the, problem, requires, deep, solutions, of, cooperation, that, might, alter, the, balance, of, its, framework, the, maritime, security, plans, for, the, region, are, based, on, the, asean, idea, of, political, security, community, the, two, main, objectives, of, the, apsc, are, to, accelerate, the, economic, growth, social, progress, and, cultural, development, by, promoting, an, identity, of, equality, and, partnership, as, the, main, foundations, of, peace, and, prosperity, additionally, the, apsc, promotes, regional, peace, and, stability, through, abiding, respect, for, justice, and, the, rule, of, law, in, the, relationship, among, countries, of, the, region, and, adherence, to, the, principles, of, the, united, nations, charter, nonetheless, the, institutional, framework, and, decision, making, procedures, in, asean, make, difficult, to, reach, agreements, on, piracy, asean, has, struggled, to, deliver, a, coordinated, response, to, solve, this, problem, in, the, region, mainly, by, two, reasons, the, first, one, could, be, related, to, the, focalized, nature, of, the, problem, in, subregions, rather, than, the, whole, region, consequently, this, focalization, generates, that, the, discussions, in, the, main, forums, the, asean, maritime, forum, amf, and, maritime, security, expert, working, group, msewg, have, not, resulted, in, actual, measures, that, tackle, piracy, and, involve, all, member, states, as, major, consensus, should, be, reached, to, enforce, them, one, example, of, this, is, the, possibility, discussed, by, the, 10, asean, member, states, to, create, a, joint, asean, navy, in, 2015, to, carry, on, operations, in, one, of, the, piracy, hotspots, in, the, region, the, strait, of, malacca, this, proposal, ended, up, being, enforced, by, bilateral, sub, regional, efforts, rather, than, in, the, asean, framework, see, recaap, for, further, information, the, second, one, consensus, on, non, traditional, security, issues, has, been, difficult, to, reach, due, to, contradictory, interest, between, member, states, particularly, in, joint, operations, between, navies, and, the, reach, of, these, joint, operations, these, issues, are, generated, mainly, by, unresolved, territorial, disputes, specially, in, the, maritime, domain, at, some, extent, they, pose, a, challenge, to, asean, members, in, their, capacity, to, cooperate, in, regards, to, the, maritime, security, approach, consequently, a, greater, multilateral, cooperation, has, been, pushed, by, the, members, to, solve, the, piracy, challenges, on, economy, trading, and, security, members, of, the, asean, have, addressed, the, necessity, for, the, regional, organization, to, make, some, concessions, and, rearrangements, to, respond, to, the, challenges, that, non, traditional, security, specifically, piracy, issues, posse, to, the, security, of, the, asean, members, despite, the, efforts, and, plans, made, by, the, asean, this, organization, is, expected, to, overcome, the, image, of, being, regarded, solely, as, a, forum, to, discuss, security, issues, two, possible, solutions, has, been, proposed, by, some, member, states, for, this, purpose, 1, promoting, relationships, with, other, major, actors, regionally, to, overcome, the, short, time, challenges, and, 2, rearrange, the, institutional, framework, to, avoid, contention, and, seek, cooperation, to, maximize, the, aggregate, ability, in, order, to, benefit, from, making, the, sea, fulfil, its, economic, security, and, other, goals, in, addition, to, piracy, there, are, several, significant, issues, facing, asean, today, including, human, rights, violations, repression, and, democratic, backsliding, across, the, region, various, political, leaders, are, known, human, rights, abusers, however, there, is, no, proper, accountability, process, and, often, human, rights, violations, are, sidelined, by, economic, or, political, interests, myanmar, is, in, the, midst, of, a, devastating, civil, war, during, which, the, military, government, that, was, installed, following, a, coup, d, tat, has, carried, out, horrendous, human, rights, violations, against, the, rohingya, population, the, non, interference, principle, upon, which, asean, was, founded, further, complicates, the, situation, as, countries, must, respect, one, another, s, sovereignty, and, have, pledged, not, to, become, involved, in, the, domestic, affairs, of, other, asean, members, asean, and, other, multilateral, institutions, can, continue, to, practice, non, interference, while, working, towards, an, overarching, policy, or, agreement, that, holds, political, leaders, accountable, for, repeated, human, rights, abuses, however, their, fundamental, principles, of, non, interference, and, consensus, building, that, were, vital, in, helping, coordinate, responses, to, the, covid, 19, pandemic, are, proving, to, be, obstacles, as, states, have, different, stances, on, handling, human, rights, concerns, which, could, prevent, a, consensus, from, being, reached, and, stall, any, sort, of, response, to, the, inhumane, crimes, a, comprehensive, security, framework, must, emphasize, security, cooperation, and, peaceful, resolution, of, disputes, scholars, argue, that, given, the, highly, interconnected, nature, of, the, current, world, countries, must, work, towards, a, broader, conception, of, security, beyond, military, security, when, asean, was, founded, in, 1976, the, world, was, embroiled, in, the, cold, war, and, military, strength, and, preparedness, was, at, the, forefront, of, security, policy, for, many, states, both, long, established, and, newly, independent, the, transition, from, a, bipolar, globe, during, the, mid, to, late, 20th, century, to, a, modern, multipolar, stage, has, driven, the, need, and, rise, of, multilateral, institutions, given, the, ongoing, hegemonic, battle, between, the, united, states, and, china, a, successful, comprehensive, security, framework, for, asean, would, be, one, that, prevents, one, state, from, overpowering, the, others, and, reinforces, the, central, consensus, building, principle, of, asean, not, only, can, a, comprehensive, framework, strengthen, security, relations, among, asean, members, but, also, foster, economic, integration, and, build, greater, trust, among, partners, organisations, asean, summits, asean, organisations, asean, related, websites
