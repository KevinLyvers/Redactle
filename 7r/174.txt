learning, is, the, process, of, acquiring, new, understanding, knowledge, behaviors, skills, values, attitudes, and, preferences, the, ability, to, learn, is, possessed, by, humans, non, human, animals, and, some, machines, there, is, also, evidence, for, some, kind, of, learning, in, certain, plants, some, learning, is, immediate, induced, by, a, single, event, e, g, being, burned, by, a, hot, stove, but, much, skill, and, knowledge, accumulate, from, repeated, experiences, the, changes, induced, by, learning, often, last, a, lifetime, and, it, is, hard, to, distinguish, learned, material, that, seems, to, be, lost, from, that, which, cannot, be, retrieved, human, learning, starts, at, birth, it, might, even, start, before, in, terms, of, an, embryo, s, need, for, both, interaction, with, and, freedom, within, its, environment, within, the, womb, and, continues, until, death, as, a, consequence, of, ongoing, interactions, between, people, and, their, environment, the, nature, and, processes, involved, in, learning, are, studied, in, many, established, fields, including, educational, psychology, neuropsychology, experimental, psychology, cognitive, sciences, and, pedagogy, as, well, as, emerging, fields, of, knowledge, e, g, with, a, shared, interest, in, the, topic, of, learning, from, safety, events, such, as, incidents, accidents, or, in, collaborative, learning, health, systems, research, in, such, fields, has, led, to, the, identification, of, various, sorts, of, learning, for, example, learning, may, occur, as, a, result, of, habituation, or, classical, conditioning, operant, conditioning, or, as, a, result, of, more, complex, activities, such, as, play, seen, only, in, relatively, intelligent, animals, learning, may, occur, consciously, or, without, conscious, awareness, learning, that, an, aversive, event, cannot, be, avoided, or, escaped, may, result, in, a, condition, called, learned, helplessness, there, is, evidence, for, human, behavioral, learning, prenatally, in, which, habituation, has, been, observed, as, early, as, 32, weeks, into, gestation, indicating, that, the, central, nervous, system, is, sufficiently, developed, and, primed, for, learning, and, memory, to, occur, very, early, on, in, development, play, has, been, approached, by, several, theorists, as, a, form, of, learning, children, experiment, with, the, world, learn, the, rules, and, learn, to, interact, through, play, lev, vygotsky, agrees, that, play, is, pivotal, for, children, s, development, since, they, make, meaning, of, their, environment, through, playing, educational, games, for, vygotsky, however, play, is, the, first, form, of, learning, language, and, communication, and, the, stage, where, a, child, begins, to, understand, rules, and, symbols, this, has, led, to, a, view, that, learning, in, organisms, is, always, related, to, semiosis, and, is, often, associated, with, representational, systems, activity, there, are, various, functional, categorizations, of, memory, which, have, developed, some, memory, researchers, distinguish, memory, based, on, the, relationship, between, the, stimuli, involved, associative, vs, non, associative, or, based, to, whether, the, content, can, be, communicated, through, language, declarative, explicit, vs, procedural, implicit, some, of, these, categories, can, in, turn, be, parsed, into, sub, types, for, instance, declarative, memory, comprises, both, episodic, and, semantic, memory, non, associative, learning, refers, to, a, relatively, permanent, change, in, the, strength, of, response, to, a, single, stimulus, due, to, repeated, exposure, to, that, stimulus, this, definition, exempts, the, changes, caused, by, sensory, adaptation, fatigue, or, injury, non, associative, learning, can, be, divided, into, habituation, and, sensitization, habituation, is, an, example, of, non, associative, learning, in, which, one, or, more, components, of, an, innate, response, e, g, response, probability, response, duration, to, a, stimulus, diminishes, when, the, stimulus, is, repeated, thus, habituation, must, be, distinguished, from, extinction, which, is, an, associative, process, in, operant, extinction, for, example, a, response, declines, because, it, is, no, longer, followed, by, a, reward, an, example, of, habituation, can, be, seen, in, small, song, birds, if, a, stuffed, owl, or, similar, predator, is, put, into, the, cage, the, birds, initially, react, to, it, as, though, it, were, a, real, predator, soon, the, birds, react, less, showing, habituation, if, another, stuffed, owl, is, introduced, or, the, same, one, removed, and, re, introduced, the, birds, react, to, it, again, as, though, it, were, a, predator, demonstrating, that, it, is, only, a, very, specific, stimulus, that, is, habituated, to, namely, one, particular, unmoving, owl, in, one, place, the, habituation, process, is, faster, for, stimuli, that, occur, at, a, high, rather, than, for, stimuli, that, occur, at, a, low, rate, as, well, as, for, the, weak, and, strong, stimuli, respectively, habituation, has, been, shown, in, essentially, every, species, of, animal, as, well, as, the, sensitive, plant, mimosa, pudica, and, the, large, protozoan, stentor, coeruleus, this, concept, acts, in, direct, opposition, to, sensitization, sensitization, is, an, example, of, non, associative, learning, in, which, the, progressive, amplification, of, a, response, follows, repeated, administrations, of, a, stimulus, this, is, based, on, the, notion, that, a, defensive, reflex, to, a, stimulus, such, as, withdrawal, or, escape, becomes, stronger, after, the, exposure, to, a, different, harmful, or, threatening, stimulus, an, everyday, example, of, this, mechanism, is, the, repeated, tonic, stimulation, of, peripheral, nerves, that, occurs, if, a, person, rubs, their, arm, continuously, after, a, while, this, stimulation, creates, a, warm, sensation, that, can, eventually, turn, painful, this, pain, results, from, a, progressively, amplified, synaptic, response, of, the, peripheral, nerves, this, sends, a, warning, that, the, stimulation, is, harmful, sensitization, is, thought, to, underlie, both, adaptive, as, well, as, maladaptive, learning, processes, in, the, organism, active, learning, occurs, when, a, person, takes, control, of, his, her, learning, experience, since, understanding, information, is, the, key, aspect, of, learning, it, is, important, for, learners, to, recognize, what, they, understand, and, what, they, do, not, by, doing, so, they, can, monitor, their, own, mastery, of, subjects, active, learning, encourages, learners, to, have, an, internal, dialogue, in, which, they, verbalize, understandings, this, and, other, meta, cognitive, strategies, can, be, taught, to, a, child, over, time, studies, within, metacognition, have, proven, the, value, in, active, learning, claiming, that, the, learning, is, usually, at, a, stronger, level, as, a, result, in, addition, learners, have, more, incentive, to, learn, when, they, have, control, over, not, only, how, they, learn, but, also, what, they, learn, active, learning, is, a, key, characteristic, of, student, centered, learning, conversely, passive, learning, and, direct, instruction, are, characteristics, of, teacher, centered, learning, or, traditional, education, associative, learning, is, the, process, by, which, a, person, or, animal, learns, an, association, between, two, stimuli, or, events, in, classical, conditioning, a, previously, neutral, stimulus, is, repeatedly, paired, with, a, reflex, eliciting, stimulus, until, eventually, the, neutral, stimulus, elicits, a, response, on, its, own, in, operant, conditioning, a, behavior, that, is, reinforced, or, punished, in, the, presence, of, a, stimulus, becomes, more, or, less, likely, to, occur, in, the, presence, of, that, stimulus, operant, conditioning, is, a, way, in, which, behavior, can, be, shaped, or, modified, according, to, the, desires, of, the, trainer, or, head, individual, operant, conditioning, uses, the, thought, that, living, things, seek, pleasure, and, avoid, pain, and, that, an, animal, or, human, can, learn, through, receiving, either, reward, or, punishment, at, a, specific, time, called, trace, conditioning, trace, conditioning, is, the, small, and, ideal, period, of, time, between, the, subject, performing, the, desired, behavior, and, receiving, the, positive, reinforcement, as, a, result, of, their, performance, the, reward, needs, to, be, given, immediately, after, the, completion, of, the, wanted, behavior, operant, conditioning, is, different, from, classical, conditioning, in, that, it, shapes, behavior, not, solely, on, bodily, reflexes, that, occur, naturally, to, a, specific, stimulus, but, rather, focuses, on, the, shaping, of, wanted, behavior, that, requires, conscious, thought, and, ultimately, requires, learning, punishment, and, reinforcement, are, the, two, principal, ways, in, which, operant, conditioning, occurs, punishment, is, used, to, reduce, unwanted, behavior, and, ultimately, from, the, learner, s, perspective, leads, to, avoidance, of, the, punishment, not, necessarily, avoidance, of, the, unwanted, behavior, punishment, is, not, an, appropriate, way, to, increase, wanted, behavior, for, animals, or, humans, punishment, can, be, divided, into, two, subcategories, positive, punishment, and, negative, punishment, positive, punishment, is, when, an, aversive, aspect, of, life, or, thing, is, added, to, the, subject, for, this, reason, it, is, called, positive, punishment, for, example, the, parent, spanking, their, child, would, be, considered, a, positive, punishment, because, a, spanking, was, added, to, the, child, negative, punishment, is, considered, the, removal, of, something, loved, or, desirable, from, the, subject, for, example, when, a, parent, puts, his, child, in, time, out, in, reality, the, child, is, losing, the, opportunity, to, be, with, friends, or, to, enjoy, the, freedom, to, do, as, he, pleases, in, this, example, negative, punishment, is, the, removal, of, the, child, s, desired, rights, to, play, with, his, friends, etc, reinforcement, on, the, other, hand, is, used, to, increase, a, wanted, behavior, either, through, negative, reinforcement, or, positive, reinforcement, negative, reinforcement, is, defined, by, removing, an, undesirable, aspect, of, life, or, thing, for, example, a, dog, might, learn, to, sit, as, the, trainer, scratches, his, ears, which, ultimately, is, removing, his, itches, undesirable, aspect, positive, reinforcement, is, defined, by, adding, a, desirable, aspect, of, life, or, thing, for, example, a, dog, might, learn, to, sit, if, he, receives, a, treat, in, this, example, the, treat, was, added, to, the, dog, s, life, the, typical, paradigm, for, classical, conditioning, involves, repeatedly, pairing, an, unconditioned, stimulus, which, unfailingly, evokes, a, reflexive, response, with, another, previously, neutral, stimulus, which, does, not, normally, evoke, the, response, following, conditioning, the, response, occurs, both, to, the, unconditioned, stimulus, and, to, the, other, unrelated, stimulus, now, referred, to, as, the, conditioned, stimulus, the, response, to, the, conditioned, stimulus, is, termed, a, conditioned, response, the, classic, example, is, ivan, pavlov, and, his, dogs, pavlov, fed, his, dogs, meat, powder, which, naturally, made, the, dogs, salivate, salivating, is, a, reflexive, response, to, the, meat, powder, meat, powder, is, the, unconditioned, stimulus, us, and, the, salivation, is, the, unconditioned, response, ur, pavlov, rang, a, bell, before, presenting, the, meat, powder, the, first, time, pavlov, rang, the, bell, the, neutral, stimulus, the, dogs, did, not, salivate, but, once, he, put, the, meat, powder, in, their, mouths, they, began, to, salivate, after, numerous, pairings, of, bell, and, food, the, dogs, learned, that, the, bell, signaled, that, food, was, about, to, come, and, began, to, salivate, when, they, heard, the, bell, once, this, occurred, the, bell, became, the, conditioned, stimulus, cs, and, the, salivation, to, the, bell, became, the, conditioned, response, cr, classical, conditioning, has, been, demonstrated, in, many, species, for, example, it, is, seen, in, honeybees, in, the, proboscis, extension, reflex, paradigm, it, was, recently, also, demonstrated, in, garden, pea, plants, another, influential, person, in, the, world, of, classical, conditioning, is, john, b, watson, watson, s, work, was, very, influential, and, paved, the, way, for, b, f, skinner, s, radical, behaviorism, watson, s, behaviorism, and, philosophy, of, science, stood, in, direct, contrast, to, freud, and, other, accounts, based, largely, on, introspection, watson, s, view, was, that, the, introspective, method, was, too, subjective, and, that, we, should, limit, the, study, of, human, development, to, directly, observable, behaviors, in, 1913, watson, published, the, article, psychology, as, the, behaviorist, views, in, which, he, argued, that, laboratory, studies, should, serve, psychology, best, as, a, science, watson, s, most, famous, and, controversial, experiment, was, little, albert, where, he, demonstrated, how, psychologists, can, account, for, the, learning, of, emotion, through, classical, conditioning, principles, observational, learning, is, learning, that, occurs, through, observing, the, behavior, of, others, it, is, a, form, of, social, learning, which, takes, various, forms, based, on, various, processes, in, humans, this, form, of, learning, seems, to, not, need, reinforcement, to, occur, but, instead, requires, a, social, model, such, as, a, parent, sibling, friend, or, teacher, with, surroundings, imprinting, is, a, kind, of, learning, occurring, at, a, particular, life, stage, that, is, rapid, and, apparently, independent, of, the, consequences, of, behavior, in, filial, imprinting, young, animals, particularly, birds, form, an, association, with, another, individual, or, in, some, cases, an, object, that, they, respond, to, as, they, would, to, a, parent, in, 1935, the, austrian, zoologist, konrad, lorenz, discovered, that, certain, birds, follow, and, form, a, bond, if, the, object, makes, sounds, play, generally, describes, behavior, with, no, particular, end, in, itself, but, that, improves, performance, in, similar, future, situations, this, is, seen, in, a, wide, variety, of, vertebrates, besides, humans, but, is, mostly, limited, to, mammals, and, birds, cats, are, known, to, play, with, a, ball, of, string, when, young, which, gives, them, experience, with, catching, prey, besides, inanimate, objects, animals, may, play, with, other, members, of, their, own, species, or, other, animals, such, as, orcas, playing, with, seals, they, have, caught, play, involves, a, significant, cost, to, animals, such, as, increased, vulnerability, to, predators, and, the, risk, of, injury, and, possibly, infection, it, also, consumes, energy, so, there, must, be, significant, benefits, associated, with, play, for, it, to, have, evolved, play, is, generally, seen, in, younger, animals, suggesting, a, link, with, learning, however, it, may, also, have, other, benefits, not, associated, directly, with, learning, for, example, improving, physical, fitness, play, as, it, pertains, to, humans, as, a, form, of, learning, is, central, to, a, child, s, learning, and, development, through, play, children, learn, social, skills, such, as, sharing, and, collaboration, children, develop, emotional, skills, such, as, learning, to, deal, with, the, emotion, of, anger, through, play, activities, as, a, form, of, learning, play, also, facilitates, the, development, of, thinking, and, language, skills, in, children, there, are, five, types, of, play, these, five, types, of, play, are, often, intersecting, all, types, of, play, generate, thinking, and, problem, solving, skills, in, children, children, learn, to, think, creatively, when, they, learn, through, play, specific, activities, involved, in, each, type, of, play, change, over, time, as, humans, progress, through, the, lifespan, play, as, a, form, of, learning, can, occur, solitarily, or, involve, interacting, with, others, enculturation, is, the, process, by, which, people, learn, values, and, behaviors, that, are, appropriate, or, necessary, in, their, surrounding, culture, parents, other, adults, and, peers, shape, the, individual, s, understanding, of, these, values, if, successful, enculturation, results, in, competence, in, the, language, values, and, rituals, of, the, culture, this, is, different, from, acculturation, where, a, person, adopts, the, values, and, societal, rules, of, a, culture, different, from, their, native, one, multiple, examples, of, enculturation, can, be, found, cross, culturally, collaborative, practices, in, the, mazahua, people, have, shown, that, participation, in, everyday, interaction, and, later, learning, activities, contributed, to, enculturation, rooted, in, nonverbal, social, experience, as, the, children, participated, in, everyday, activities, they, learned, the, cultural, significance, of, these, interactions, the, collaborative, and, helpful, behaviors, exhibited, by, mexican, and, mexican, heritage, children, is, a, cultural, practice, known, as, being, acomedido, chillihuani, girls, in, peru, described, themselves, as, weaving, constantly, following, behavior, shown, by, the, other, adults, episodic, learning, is, a, change, in, behavior, that, occurs, as, a, result, of, an, event, for, example, a, fear, of, dogs, that, follows, being, bitten, by, a, dog, is, episodic, learning, episodic, learning, is, so, named, because, events, are, recorded, into, episodic, memory, which, is, one, of, the, three, forms, of, explicit, learning, and, retrieval, along, with, perceptual, memory, and, semantic, memory, episodic, memory, remembers, events, and, history, that, are, embedded, in, experience, and, this, is, distinguished, from, semantic, memory, which, attempts, to, extract, facts, out, of, their, experiential, context, or, as, some, describe, a, timeless, organization, of, knowledge, for, instance, if, a, person, remembers, the, grand, canyon, from, a, recent, visit, it, is, an, episodic, memory, he, would, use, semantic, memory, to, answer, someone, who, would, ask, him, information, such, as, where, the, grand, canyon, is, a, study, revealed, that, humans, are, very, accurate, in, the, recognition, of, episodic, memory, even, without, deliberate, intention, to, memorize, it, this, is, said, to, indicate, a, very, large, storage, capacity, of, the, brain, for, things, that, people, pay, attention, to, multimedia, learning, is, where, a, person, uses, both, auditory, and, visual, stimuli, to, learn, information, this, type, of, learning, relies, on, dual, coding, theory, electronic, learning, or, e, learning, is, computer, enhanced, learning, a, specific, and, always, more, diffused, e, learning, is, mobile, learning, m, learning, which, uses, different, mobile, telecommunication, equipment, such, as, cellular, phones, when, a, learner, interacts, with, the, e, learning, environment, it, is, called, augmented, learning, by, adapting, to, the, needs, of, individuals, the, context, driven, instruction, can, be, dynamically, tailored, to, the, learner, s, natural, environment, augmented, digital, content, may, include, text, images, video, audio, music, and, voice, by, personalizing, instruction, augmented, learning, has, been, shown, to, improve, learning, performance, for, a, lifetime, see, also, minimally, invasive, education, moore, 1989, purported, that, three, core, types, of, interaction, are, necessary, for, quality, effective, online, learning, in, his, theory, of, transactional, distance, moore, 1993, contented, that, structure, and, interaction, or, dialogue, bridge, the, gap, in, understanding, and, communication, that, is, created, by, geographical, distances, known, as, transactional, distance, rote, learning, is, memorizing, information, so, that, it, can, be, recalled, by, the, learner, exactly, the, way, it, was, read, or, heard, the, major, technique, used, for, rote, learning, is, learning, by, repetition, based, on, the, idea, that, a, learner, can, recall, the, material, exactly, but, not, its, meaning, if, the, information, is, repeatedly, processed, rote, learning, is, used, in, diverse, areas, from, mathematics, to, music, to, religion, meaningful, learning, is, the, concept, that, learned, knowledge, e, g, a, fact, is, fully, understood, to, the, extent, that, it, relates, to, other, knowledge, to, this, end, meaningful, learning, contrasts, with, rote, learning, in, which, information, is, acquired, without, regard, to, understanding, meaningful, learning, on, the, other, hand, implies, there, is, a, comprehensive, knowledge, of, the, context, of, the, facts, learned, evidence, based, learning, is, the, use, of, evidence, from, well, designed, scientific, studies, to, accelerate, learning, evidence, based, learning, methods, such, as, spaced, repetition, can, increase, the, rate, at, which, a, student, learns, formal, learning, is, a, deliberate, way, attaining, of, knowledge, which, takes, place, within, a, teacher, student, environment, such, as, in, a, school, system, or, work, environment, the, term, formal, learning, has, nothing, to, do, with, the, formality, of, the, learning, but, rather, the, way, it, is, directed, and, organized, in, formal, learning, the, learning, or, training, departments, set, out, the, goals, and, objectives, of, the, learning, and, oftentimes, learners, will, be, awarded, with, a, diploma, or, a, type, of, formal, recognition, non, formal, learning, is, organized, learning, outside, the, formal, learning, system, for, example, learning, by, coming, together, with, people, with, similar, interests, and, exchanging, viewpoints, in, clubs, or, in, international, youth, organizations, and, workshops, from, the, organizer, s, point, of, reference, non, formal, learning, does, not, always, need, a, main, objective, or, learning, outcome, from, the, learner, s, point, of, view, non, formal, learning, although, not, focused, on, outcomes, often, results, in, an, intentional, learning, opportunity, informal, learning, is, less, structured, than, non, formal, learning, it, may, occur, through, the, experience, of, day, to, day, situations, for, example, one, would, learn, to, look, ahead, while, walking, because, of, the, possible, dangers, inherent, in, not, paying, attention, to, where, one, is, going, it, is, learning, from, life, during, a, meal, at, the, table, with, parents, during, play, and, while, exploring, etc, for, the, learner, informal, learning, is, most, often, an, experience, of, happenstance, and, not, a, deliberately, planned, experience, thus, this, does, not, require, enrollment, into, any, class, unlike, formal, learning, informal, learning, typically, does, not, lead, to, accreditation, informal, learning, begins, to, unfold, as, the, learner, ponders, his, or, her, situation, this, type, of, learning, does, not, require, a, professor, of, any, kind, and, learning, outcomes, are, unforeseen, following, the, learning, experience, informal, learning, is, self, directed, and, because, it, focuses, on, day, to, day, situations, the, value, of, informal, learning, can, be, considered, high, as, a, result, information, retrieved, from, informal, learning, experiences, will, likely, be, applicable, to, daily, life, children, with, informal, learning, can, at, times, yield, stronger, support, than, subjects, with, formal, learning, in, the, topic, of, mathematics, daily, life, experiences, take, place, in, the, workforce, family, life, and, any, other, situation, that, may, arise, during, one, s, lifetime, informal, learning, is, voluntary, from, the, learner, s, viewpoint, and, may, require, making, mistakes, and, learning, from, them, informal, learning, allows, the, individual, to, discover, coping, strategies, for, difficult, emotions, that, may, arise, while, learning, from, the, learner, s, perspective, informal, learning, can, become, purposeful, because, the, learner, chooses, which, rate, is, appropriate, to, learn, and, because, this, type, of, learning, tends, to, take, place, within, smaller, groups, or, by, oneself, the, educational, system, may, use, a, combination, of, formal, informal, and, nonformal, learning, methods, the, un, and, eu, recognize, these, different, forms, of, learning, cf, links, below, in, some, schools, students, can, get, points, that, count, in, the, formal, learning, systems, if, they, get, work, done, in, informal, learning, circuits, they, may, be, given, time, to, assist, international, youth, workshops, and, training, courses, on, the, condition, they, prepare, contribute, share, and, can, prove, this, offered, valuable, new, insight, helped, to, acquire, new, skills, a, place, to, get, experience, in, organizing, teaching, etc, to, learn, a, skill, such, as, solving, a, rubik, s, cube, quickly, several, factors, come, into, play, at, once, tangential, learning, is, the, process, by, which, people, self, educate, if, a, topic, is, exposed, to, them, in, a, context, that, they, already, enjoy, for, example, after, playing, a, music, based, video, game, some, people, may, be, motivated, to, learn, how, to, play, a, real, instrument, or, after, watching, a, tv, show, that, references, faust, and, lovecraft, some, people, may, be, inspired, to, read, the, original, work, self, education, can, be, improved, with, systematization, according, to, experts, in, natural, learning, self, oriented, learning, training, has, proven, an, effective, tool, for, assisting, independent, learners, with, the, natural, phases, of, learning, extra, credits, writer, and, game, designer, james, portnow, was, the, first, to, suggest, games, as, a, potential, venue, for, tangential, learning, mozelius, et, al, points, out, that, intrinsic, integration, of, learning, content, seems, to, be, a, crucial, design, factor, and, that, games, that, include, modules, for, further, self, studies, tend, to, present, good, results, the, built, in, encyclopedias, in, the, civilization, games, are, presented, as, an, example, by, using, these, modules, gamers, can, dig, deeper, for, knowledge, about, historical, events, in, the, gameplay, the, importance, of, rules, that, regulate, learning, modules, and, game, experience, is, discussed, by, moreno, c, in, a, case, study, about, the, mobile, game, kiwaka, in, this, game, developed, by, landka, in, collaboration, with, esa, and, eso, progress, is, rewarded, with, educational, content, as, opposed, to, traditional, education, games, where, learning, activities, are, rewarded, with, gameplay, dialogic, learning, is, a, type, of, learning, based, on, dialogue, in, incidental, teaching, learning, is, not, planned, by, the, instructor, or, the, student, it, occurs, as, a, byproduct, of, another, activity, an, experience, observation, self, reflection, interaction, unique, event, e, g, in, response, to, incidents, accidents, or, common, routine, task, this, learning, happens, in, addition, to, or, apart, from, the, instructor, s, plans, and, the, student, s, expectations, an, example, of, incidental, teaching, is, when, the, instructor, places, a, train, set, on, top, of, a, cabinet, if, the, child, points, or, walks, towards, the, cabinet, the, instructor, prompts, the, student, to, say, train, once, the, student, says, train, he, gets, access, to, the, train, set, here, are, some, steps, most, commonly, used, in, incidental, teaching, incidental, learning, is, an, occurrence, that, is, not, generally, accounted, for, using, the, traditional, methods, of, instructional, objectives, and, outcomes, assessment, this, type, of, learning, occurs, in, part, as, a, product, of, social, interaction, and, active, involvement, in, both, online, and, onsite, courses, research, implies, that, some, un, assessed, aspects, of, onsite, and, online, learning, challenge, the, equivalency, of, education, between, the, two, modalities, both, onsite, and, online, learning, have, distinct, advantages, with, traditional, on, campus, students, experiencing, higher, degrees, of, incidental, learning, in, three, times, as, many, areas, as, online, students, additional, research, is, called, for, to, investigate, the, implications, of, these, findings, both, conceptually, and, pedagogically, benjamin, bloom, has, suggested, three, domains, of, learning, in, his, taxonomy, which, are, these, domains, are, not, mutually, exclusive, for, example, in, learning, to, play, chess, the, person, must, learn, the, rules, cognitive, domain, but, must, also, learn, how, to, set, up, the, chess, pieces, and, how, to, properly, hold, and, move, a, chess, piece, psychomotor, furthermore, later, in, the, game, the, person, may, even, learn, to, love, the, game, itself, value, its, applications, in, life, and, appreciate, its, history, affective, domain, transfer, of, learning, is, the, application, of, skill, knowledge, or, understanding, to, resolve, a, novel, problem, or, situation, that, happens, when, certain, conditions, are, fulfilled, research, indicates, that, learning, transfer, is, infrequent, most, common, when, cued, primed, and, guided, and, has, sought, to, clarify, what, it, is, and, how, it, might, be, promoted, through, instruction, over, the, history, of, its, discourse, various, hypotheses, and, definitions, have, been, advanced, first, it, is, speculated, that, different, types, of, transfer, exist, including, near, transfer, the, application, of, skill, to, solve, a, novel, problem, in, a, similar, context, and, far, transfer, the, application, of, skill, to, solve, a, novel, problem, presented, in, a, different, context, furthermore, perkins, and, salomon, 1992, suggest, that, positive, transfer, in, cases, when, learning, supports, novel, problem, solving, and, negative, transfer, occurs, when, prior, learning, inhibits, performance, on, highly, correlated, tasks, such, as, second, or, third, language, learning, concepts, of, positive, and, negative, transfer, have, a, long, history, researchers, in, the, early, 20th, century, described, the, possibility, that, habits, or, mental, acts, developed, by, a, particular, kind, of, training, may, inhibit, rather, than, facilitate, other, mental, activities, finally, schwarz, bransford, and, sears, 2005, have, proposed, that, transferring, knowledge, into, a, situation, may, differ, from, transferring, knowledge, out, to, a, situation, as, a, means, to, reconcile, findings, that, transfer, may, both, be, frequent, and, challenging, to, promote, a, significant, and, long, research, history, has, also, attempted, to, explicate, the, conditions, under, which, transfer, of, learning, might, occur, early, research, by, ruger, for, example, found, that, the, level, of, attention, attitudes, method, of, attack, or, method, for, tackling, a, problem, a, search, for, new, points, of, view, a, careful, testing, of, hypothesis, and, generalization, were, all, valuable, approaches, for, promoting, transfer, to, encourage, transfer, through, teaching, perkins, and, salomon, recommend, aligning, hugging, instruction, with, practice, and, assessment, and, bridging, or, encouraging, learners, to, reflect, on, past, experiences, or, make, connections, between, prior, knowledge, and, current, content, some, aspects, of, intelligence, are, inherited, genetically, so, different, learners, to, some, degree, have, different, abilities, with, regard, to, learning, and, speed, of, learning, problems, like, malnutrition, fatigue, and, poor, physical, health, can, slow, learning, as, can, bad, ventilation, or, poor, lighting, at, home, and, unhygienic, living, conditions, the, design, quality, and, setting, of, a, learning, space, such, as, a, school, or, classroom, can, each, be, critical, to, the, success, of, a, learning, environment, size, configuration, comfort, fresh, air, temperature, light, acoustics, furniture, can, all, affect, a, student, s, learning, the, tools, used, by, both, instructors, and, students, directly, affect, how, information, is, conveyed, from, the, display, and, writing, surfaces, blackboards, markerboards, tack, surfaces, to, digital, technologies, for, example, if, a, room, is, too, crowded, stress, levels, rise, student, attention, is, reduced, and, furniture, arrangement, is, restricted, if, furniture, is, incorrectly, arranged, sightlines, to, the, instructor, or, instructional, material, are, limited, and, the, ability, to, suit, the, learning, or, lesson, style, is, restricted, aesthetics, can, also, play, a, role, for, if, student, morale, suffers, so, does, motivation, to, attend, school, intrinsic, motivation, such, as, a, student, s, own, intellectual, curiosity, or, desire, to, experiment, or, explore, has, been, found, to, sustain, learning, more, effectively, than, extrinsic, motivations, such, as, grades, or, parental, requirements, rote, learning, involves, repetition, in, order, to, reinforce, facts, in, memory, but, has, been, criticized, as, ineffective, and, drill, and, kill, since, it, kills, intrinsic, motivation, alternatives, to, rote, learning, include, active, learning, and, meaningful, learning, the, speed, accuracy, and, retention, depend, upon, aptitude, attitude, interest, attention, energy, level, and, motivation, of, the, students, students, who, answer, a, question, properly, or, give, good, results, should, be, praised, this, encouragement, increases, their, ability, and, helps, them, produce, better, results, certain, attitudes, such, as, always, finding, fault, in, a, student, s, answer, or, provoking, or, embarrassing, the, student, in, front, of, a, class, are, counterproductive, certain, techniques, can, increase, long, term, retention, the, underlying, molecular, basis, of, learning, appears, to, be, dynamic, changes, in, gene, expression, occurring, in, brain, neurons, that, are, introduced, by, epigenetic, mechanisms, epigenetic, regulation, of, gene, expression, involves, most, notably, chemical, modification, of, dna, or, dna, associated, histone, proteins, these, chemical, modifications, can, cause, long, lasting, changes, in, gene, expression, epigenetic, mechanisms, involved, in, learning, include, the, methylation, and, demethylation, of, neuronal, dna, as, well, as, methylation, acetylation, and, deacetylation, of, neuronal, histone, proteins, during, learning, information, processing, in, the, brain, involves, induction, of, oxidative, modification, in, neuronal, dna, followed, by, the, employment, of, dna, repair, processes, that, introduce, epigenetic, alterations, in, particular, the, dna, repair, processes, of, non, homologous, end, joining, and, base, excision, repair, are, employed, in, learning, and, memory, formation, the, nervous, system, continues, to, develop, during, adulthood, until, brain, death, for, example, learning, is, often, more, efficient, in, children, and, takes, longer, or, is, more, difficult, with, age, a, study, using, neuroimaging, identified, rapid, neurotransmitter, gaba, boosting, as, a, major, potential, explanation, component, for, why, that, is, children, s, brains, contain, more, silent, synapses, that, are, inactive, until, recruited, as, part, of, neuroplasticity, and, flexible, learning, or, memories, neuroplasticity, is, heightened, during, critical, or, sensitive, periods, of, brain, development, mainly, referring, to, brain, development, during, child, development, what, humans, learn, at, the, early, stages, and, what, they, learn, to, apply, sets, humans, on, course, for, life, or, has, a, disproportional, impact, adults, usually, have, a, higher, capacity, to, select, what, they, learn, to, what, extent, and, how, for, example, children, may, learn, the, given, subjects, and, topics, of, school, curricula, via, classroom, blackboard, transcription, handwriting, instead, of, being, able, to, choose, specific, topics, skills, or, jobs, to, learn, and, the, styles, of, learning, for, instance, children, may, not, have, developed, consolidated, interests, ethics, interest, in, purpose, and, meaningful, activities, knowledge, about, real, world, requirements, and, demands, and, priorities, animals, gain, knowledge, in, two, ways, first, is, learning, in, which, an, animal, gathers, information, about, its, environment, and, uses, this, information, for, example, if, an, animal, eats, something, that, hurts, its, stomach, it, learns, not, to, eat, that, again, the, second, is, innate, knowledge, that, is, genetically, inherited, an, example, of, this, is, when, a, horse, is, born, and, can, immediately, walk, the, horse, has, not, learned, this, behavior, it, simply, knows, how, to, do, it, in, some, scenarios, innate, knowledge, is, more, beneficial, than, learned, knowledge, however, in, other, scenarios, the, opposite, is, true, animals, must, learn, certain, behaviors, when, it, is, disadvantageous, to, have, a, specific, innate, behavior, in, these, situations, learning, evolves, in, the, species, in, a, changing, environment, an, animal, must, constantly, gain, new, information, to, survive, however, in, a, stable, environment, this, same, individual, needs, to, gather, the, information, it, needs, once, and, then, rely, on, it, for, the, rest, of, its, life, therefore, different, scenarios, better, suit, either, learning, or, innate, knowledge, essentially, the, cost, of, obtaining, certain, knowledge, versus, the, benefit, of, already, having, it, determines, whether, an, animal, evolved, to, learn, in, a, given, situation, or, whether, it, innately, knew, the, information, if, the, cost, of, gaining, the, knowledge, outweighs, the, benefit, of, having, it, then, the, animal, does, not, evolve, to, learn, in, this, scenario, but, instead, non, learning, evolves, however, if, the, benefit, of, having, certain, information, outweighs, the, cost, of, obtaining, it, then, the, animal, is, far, more, likely, to, evolve, to, have, to, learn, this, information, non, learning, is, more, likely, to, evolve, in, two, scenarios, if, an, environment, is, static, and, change, does, not, or, rarely, occurs, then, learning, is, simply, unnecessary, because, there, is, no, need, for, learning, in, this, scenario, and, because, learning, could, prove, disadvantageous, due, to, the, time, it, took, to, learn, the, information, non, learning, evolves, similarly, if, an, environment, is, in, a, constant, state, of, change, learning, is, also, disadvantageous, as, anything, learned, is, immediately, irrelevant, because, of, the, changing, environment, the, learned, information, no, longer, applies, essentially, the, animal, would, be, just, as, successful, if, it, took, a, guess, as, if, it, learned, in, this, situation, non, learning, evolves, in, fact, a, study, of, drosophila, melanogaster, showed, that, learning, can, actually, lead, to, a, decrease, in, productivity, possibly, because, egg, laying, behaviors, and, decisions, were, impaired, by, interference, from, the, memories, gained, from, the, newly, learned, materials, or, because, of, the, cost, of, energy, in, learning, however, in, environments, where, change, occurs, within, an, animal, s, lifetime, but, is, not, constant, learning, is, more, likely, to, evolve, learning, is, beneficial, in, these, scenarios, because, an, animal, can, adapt, to, the, new, situation, but, can, still, apply, the, knowledge, that, it, learns, for, a, somewhat, extended, period, of, time, therefore, learning, increases, the, chances, of, success, as, opposed, to, guessing, an, example, of, this, is, seen, in, aquatic, environments, with, landscapes, subject, to, change, in, these, environments, learning, is, favored, because, the, fish, are, predisposed, to, learn, the, specific, spatial, cues, where, they, live, in, recent, years, plant, physiologists, have, examined, the, physiology, of, plant, behavior, and, cognition, the, concepts, of, learning, and, memory, are, relevant, in, identifying, how, plants, respond, to, external, cues, a, behavior, necessary, for, survival, monica, gagliano, an, australian, professor, of, evolutionary, ecology, makes, an, argument, for, associative, learning, in, the, garden, pea, pisum, sativum, the, garden, pea, is, not, specific, to, a, region, but, rather, grows, in, cooler, higher, altitude, climates, gagliano, and, colleagues, 2016, paper, aims, to, differentiate, between, innate, phototropism, behavior, and, learned, behaviors, plants, use, light, cues, in, various, ways, such, as, to, sustain, their, metabolic, needs, and, to, maintain, their, internal, circadian, rhythms, circadian, rhythms, in, plants, are, modulated, by, endogenous, bioactive, substances, that, encourage, leaf, opening, and, leaf, closing, and, are, the, basis, of, nyctinastic, behaviors, gagliano, and, colleagues, constructed, a, classical, conditioning, test, in, which, pea, seedlings, were, divided, into, two, experimental, categories, and, placed, in, y, shaped, tubes, in, a, series, of, training, sessions, the, plants, were, exposed, to, light, coming, down, different, arms, of, the, tube, in, each, case, there, was, a, fan, blowing, lightly, down, the, tube, in, either, the, same, or, opposite, arm, as, the, light, the, unconditioned, stimulus, us, was, the, predicted, occurrence, of, light, and, the, conditioned, stimulus, cs, was, the, wind, blowing, by, the, fan, previous, experimentation, shows, that, plants, respond, to, light, by, bending, and, growing, towards, it, through, differential, cell, growth, and, division, on, one, side, of, the, plant, stem, mediated, by, auxin, signaling, pathways, during, the, testing, phase, of, gagliano, s, experiment, the, pea, seedlings, were, placed, in, different, y, pipes, and, exposed, to, the, fan, alone, their, direction, of, growth, was, subsequently, recorded, the, correct, response, by, the, seedlings, was, deemed, to, be, growing, into, the, arm, where, the, light, was, predicted, from, the, previous, day, the, majority, of, plants, in, both, experimental, conditions, grew, in, a, direction, consistent, with, the, predicted, location, of, light, based, on, the, position, of, the, fan, the, previous, day, for, example, if, the, seedling, was, trained, with, the, fan, and, light, coming, down, the, same, arm, of, the, y, pipe, the, following, day, the, seedling, grew, towards, the, fan, in, the, absence, of, light, cues, despite, the, fan, being, placed, in, the, opposite, side, of, the, y, arm, plants, in, the, control, group, showed, no, preference, to, a, particular, arm, of, the, y, pipe, the, percentage, difference, in, population, behavior, observed, between, the, control, and, experimental, groups, is, meant, to, distinguish, innate, phototropism, behavior, from, active, associative, learning, while, the, physiological, mechanism, of, associative, learning, in, plants, is, not, known, telewski, et, al, describes, a, hypothesis, that, describes, photoreception, as, the, basis, of, mechano, perception, in, plants, one, mechanism, for, mechano, perception, in, plants, relies, on, ms, ion, channels, and, calcium, channels, mechanosensory, proteins, in, cell, lipid, bilayers, known, as, ms, ion, channels, are, activated, once, they, are, physically, deformed, in, response, to, pressure, or, tension, ca2, permeable, ion, channels, are, stretch, gated, and, allow, for, the, influx, of, osmolytes, and, calcium, a, well, known, second, messenger, into, the, cell, this, ion, influx, triggers, a, passive, flow, of, water, into, the, cell, down, its, osmotic, gradient, effectively, increasing, turgor, pressure, and, causing, the, cell, to, depolarize, gagliano, hypothesizes, that, the, basis, of, associative, learning, in, pisum, sativum, is, the, coupling, of, mechanosensory, and, photosensory, pathways, and, is, mediated, by, auxin, signaling, pathways, the, result, is, directional, growth, to, maximize, a, plant, s, capture, of, sunlight, gagliano, et, al, published, another, paper, on, habituation, behaviors, in, the, mimosa, pudica, plant, whereby, the, innate, behavior, of, the, plant, was, diminished, by, repeated, exposure, to, a, stimulus, there, has, been, controversy, around, this, paper, and, more, generally, around, the, topic, of, plant, cognition, charles, abrahmson, a, psychologist, and, behavioral, biologist, says, that, part, of, the, issue, of, why, scientists, disagree, about, whether, plants, have, the, ability, to, learn, is, that, researchers, do, not, use, a, consistent, definition, of, learning, and, cognition, similarly, michael, pollan, an, author, and, journalist, says, in, his, piece, the, intelligent, plant, that, researchers, do, not, doubt, gagliano, s, data, but, rather, her, language, specifically, her, use, of, the, term, learning, and, cognition, with, respect, to, plants, a, direction, for, future, research, is, testing, whether, circadian, rhythms, in, plants, modulate, learning, and, behavior, and, surveying, researchers, definitions, of, cognition, and, learning, machine, learning, a, branch, of, artificial, intelligence, concerns, the, construction, and, study, of, systems, that, can, learn, from, data, for, example, a, machine, learning, system, could, be, trained, on, email, messages, to, learn, to, distinguish, between, spam, and, non, spam, messages, most, of, the, machine, learning, models, are, based, on, probabilistic, theories, where, each, input, e, g, an, image, is, associated, with, a, probability, to, become, the, desired, output
