varieties, of, arabic, including, its, standard, form, of, literary, arabic, known, as, modern, standard, arabic, which, is, derived, from, classical, arabic, this, distinction, exists, primarily, among, western, linguists, arabic, speakers, themselves, generally, do, not, distinguish, between, modern, standard, arabic, and, classical, arabic, but, rather, refer, to, both, as, al, arabiyyatu, l, fu, the, eloquent, arabic, or, simply, al, fu, arabic, is, the, third, most, widespread, official, language, after, english, and, french, one, of, six, official, languages, of, the, united, nations, and, is, the, liturgical, language, of, islam, arabic, is, widely, taught, in, schools, and, universities, around, the, world, and, is, used, to, varying, degrees, in, workplaces, governments, and, the, media, during, the, middle, ages, arabic, was, a, major, vehicle, of, culture, especially, in, science, mathematics, and, philosophy, as, a, result, many, european, languages, have, also, borrowed, many, words, from, it, arabic, influence, mainly, in, vocabulary, is, seen, in, european, languages, mainly, spanish, and, to, a, lesser, extent, portuguese, catalan, and, sicilian, owing, to, both, the, proximity, of, european, and, the, long, lasting, arabic, cultural, and, linguistic, presence, mainly, in, southern, iberia, during, the, al, andalus, era, the, maltese, language, is, a, semitic, language, developed, from, a, dialect, of, arabic, and, written, in, the, latin, alphabet, the, balkan, languages, including, greek, and, bulgarian, have, acquired, many, words, of, arabic, origin, especially, through, direct, contact, with, ottoman, turkish, arabic, has, influenced, many, other, languages, around, the, globe, throughout, its, history, especially, languages, where, islam, is, the, predominant, religion, and, countries, that, were, conquered, by, muslims, some, of, the, most, influenced, languages, are, persian, turkish, hindustani, hindi, and, urdu, kashmiri, kurdish, bosnian, kazakh, bengali, malay, indonesian, and, malaysian, maldivian, pashto, punjabi, albanian, armenian, azerbaijani, sicilian, spanish, greek, bulgarian, tagalog, sindhi, odia, hebrew, and, some, languages, in, parts, of, africa, such, as, hausa, amharic, tigrigna, somali, tamazight, and, swahili, conversely, arabic, has, borrowed, words, from, other, languages, including, aramaic, as, well, as, hebrew, latin, greek, persian, and, to, a, lesser, extent, turkish, english, french, and, other, semitic, languages, arabic, is, spoken, by, as, many, as, 380, million, speakers, both, native, and, non, native, in, the, arab, world, making, it, the, fifth, most, spoken, language, in, the, world, and, the, fourth, most, used, language, on, the, internet, in, terms, of, users, it, also, serves, as, the, liturgical, language, of, more, than, 2, billion, muslims, in, 2011, bloomberg, businessweek, ranked, arabic, the, fourth, most, useful, language, for, business, after, english, standard, mandarin, chinese, and, french, arabic, is, written, with, the, arabic, alphabet, which, is, an, abjad, script, and, is, written, from, right, to, left, although, the, spoken, varieties, are, sometimes, written, in, ascii, latin, from, left, to, right, with, no, standardized, orthography, arabic, is, usually, classified, as, a, central, semitic, language, linguists, still, differ, as, to, the, best, classification, of, semitic, language, sub, groups, the, semitic, languages, changed, between, proto, semitic, and, the, emergence, of, central, semitic, languages, particularly, in, grammar, innovations, of, the, central, semitic, languages, all, maintained, in, arabic, include, there, are, several, features, which, classical, arabic, the, modern, arabic, varieties, as, well, as, the, safaitic, and, hismaic, inscriptions, share, which, are, unattested, in, any, other, central, semitic, language, variety, including, the, dadanitic, and, taymanitic, languages, of, the, northern, hejaz, these, features, are, evidence, of, common, descent, from, a, hypothetical, ancestor, proto, arabic, the, following, features, of, proto, arabic, can, be, reconstructed, with, confidence, on, the, other, hand, several, arabic, varieties, are, closer, to, other, semitic, languages, and, maintain, features, not, found, in, classical, arabic, indicating, that, these, varieties, cannot, have, developed, from, classical, arabic, thus, arabic, vernaculars, do, not, descend, from, classical, arabic, classical, arabic, is, a, sister, language, rather, than, their, direct, ancestor, arabia, had, a, wide, variety, of, semitic, languages, in, antiquity, the, term, arab, was, initially, used, to, describe, those, living, in, the, arabian, peninsula, as, perceived, by, geographers, from, ancient, greece, in, the, southwest, various, central, semitic, languages, both, belonging, to, and, outside, the, ancient, south, arabian, family, e, g, southern, thamudic, were, spoken, it, is, believed, that, the, ancestors, of, the, modern, south, arabian, languages, non, central, semitic, languages, were, spoken, in, southern, arabia, at, this, time, to, the, north, in, the, oases, of, northern, hejaz, dadanitic, and, taymanitic, held, some, prestige, as, inscriptional, languages, in, najd, and, parts, of, western, arabia, a, language, known, to, scholars, as, thamudic, c, is, attested, in, eastern, arabia, inscriptions, in, a, script, derived, from, asa, attest, to, a, language, known, as, hasaitic, on, the, northwestern, frontier, of, arabia, various, languages, known, to, scholars, as, thamudic, b, thamudic, d, safaitic, and, hismaic, are, attested, the, last, two, share, important, isoglosses, with, later, forms, of, arabic, leading, scholars, to, theorize, that, safaitic, and, hismaic, are, early, forms, of, arabic, and, that, they, should, be, considered, old, arabic, linguists, generally, believe, that, old, arabic, a, collection, of, related, dialects, that, constitute, the, precursor, of, arabic, first, emerged, during, the, iron, age, previously, the, earliest, attestation, of, old, arabic, was, thought, to, be, a, single, 1st, century, ce, inscription, in, sabaic, script, at, qaryat, al, faw, in, southern, present, day, saudi, arabia, however, this, inscription, does, not, participate, in, several, of, the, key, innovations, of, the, arabic, language, group, such, as, the, conversion, of, semitic, mimation, to, nunation, in, the, singular, it, is, best, reassessed, as, a, separate, language, on, the, central, semitic, dialect, continuum, it, was, also, thought, that, old, arabic, coexisted, alongside, and, then, gradually, displaced, epigraphic, ancient, north, arabian, ana, which, was, theorized, to, have, been, the, regional, tongue, for, many, centuries, ana, despite, its, name, was, considered, a, very, distinct, language, and, mutually, unintelligible, from, arabic, scholars, named, its, variant, dialects, after, the, towns, where, the, inscriptions, were, discovered, dadanitic, taymanitic, hismaic, safaitic, however, most, arguments, for, a, single, ana, language, or, language, family, were, based, on, the, shape, of, the, definite, article, a, prefixed, h, it, has, been, argued, that, the, h, is, an, archaism, and, not, a, shared, innovation, and, thus, unsuitable, for, language, classification, rendering, the, hypothesis, of, an, ana, language, family, untenable, safaitic, and, hismaic, previously, considered, ana, should, be, considered, old, arabic, due, to, the, fact, that, they, participate, in, the, innovations, common, to, all, forms, of, arabic, the, earliest, attestation, of, continuous, arabic, text, in, an, ancestor, of, the, modern, arabic, script, are, three, lines, of, poetry, by, a, man, named, garm, all, he, found, in, en, avdat, israel, and, dated, to, around, 125, ce, this, is, followed, by, the, namara, inscription, an, epitaph, of, the, lakhmid, king, imru, al, qays, bar, amro, dating, to, 328, ce, found, at, namaraa, syria, from, the, 4th, to, the, 6th, centuries, the, nabataean, script, evolved, into, the, arabic, script, recognizable, from, the, early, islamic, era, there, are, inscriptions, in, an, undotted, 17, letter, arabic, script, dating, to, the, 6th, century, ce, found, at, four, locations, in, syria, zabad, jebel, usays, harran, umm, el, jimal, the, oldest, surviving, papyrus, in, arabic, dates, to, 643, ce, and, it, uses, dots, to, produce, the, modern, 28, letter, arabic, alphabet, the, language, of, that, papyrus, and, of, the, qur, an, is, referred, to, by, linguists, as, quranic, arabic, as, distinct, from, its, codification, soon, thereafter, into, classical, arabic, in, late, pre, islamic, times, a, transdialectal, and, transcommunal, variety, of, arabic, emerged, in, the, hejaz, which, continued, living, its, parallel, life, after, literary, arabic, had, been, institutionally, standardized, in, the, 2nd, and, 3rd, century, of, the, hijra, most, strongly, in, judeo, christian, texts, keeping, alive, ancient, features, eliminated, from, the, learned, tradition, classical, arabic, this, variety, and, both, its, classicizing, and, lay, iterations, have, been, termed, middle, arabic, in, the, past, but, they, are, thought, to, continue, an, old, higazi, register, it, is, clear, that, the, orthography, of, the, quran, was, not, developed, for, the, standardized, form, of, classical, arabic, rather, it, shows, the, attempt, on, the, part, of, writers, to, record, an, archaic, form, of, old, higazi, in, the, late, 6th, century, ad, a, relatively, uniform, intertribal, poetic, koine, distinct, from, the, spoken, vernaculars, developed, based, on, the, bedouin, dialects, of, najd, probably, in, connection, with, the, court, of, al, ra, during, the, first, islamic, century, the, majority, of, arabic, poets, and, arabic, writing, persons, spoke, arabic, as, their, mother, tongue, their, texts, although, mainly, preserved, in, far, later, manuscripts, contain, traces, of, non, standardized, classical, arabic, elements, in, morphology, and, syntax, abu,

would, not, come, to, pass, for, two, centuries, the, standardization, of, arabic, reached, completion, around, the, end, of, the, 8th, century, the, first, comprehensive, description, of, the,

had, become, an, essential, prerequisite, for, rising, into, the, higher, classes, throughout, the, islamic, world, both, for, muslims, and, non, muslims, for, example, maimonides, the, andalusi, jewish, philosopher, authored, works, in, judeo, arabic, arabic, written, in, hebrew, script, ibn, jinni, of, mosul, a, pioneer, in, phonology, wrote, prolifically, in, the, 10th, century, on, arabic,

view, has, been, challenged, in, recent, times, ahmad, al, jallad, proposes, that, there, were, at, least, two, considerably, distinct, types, of, arabic, on, the, eve, of, the, conquests, northern, and, central, al, jallad, 2009, the, modern, dialects, emerged, from, a, new, contact, situation, produced, following, the, conquests, instead, of, the, emergence, of, a, single, or, multiple, koines, the, dialects, contain, several, sedimentary, layers, of, borrowed, and, areal, features, which, they, absorbed, at, different, points, in, their, linguistic, histories, according, to, veersteegh, and, bickerton, colloquial, arabic, dialects, arose, from, pidginized, arabic, formed, from, contact, between, arabs, and, conquered, peoples, pidginization, and, subsequent, creolization, among, arabs, and, arabized, peoples, could, explain, relative, morphological, and, phonological, simplicity, of, vernacular, arabic, compared, to, classical, and, msa, in, around, the, 11th, and, 12th, centuries, in, al, andalus, the, zajal, and, muwashah, poetry, forms, developed, in, the, dialectical, arabic, of, cordoba, and, the, maghreb, the, nahda, was, a, cultural, and, especially, literary, renaissance, of, the, 19th, century, in, which, writers, sought, to, fuse, arabic, and, european, forms, of, expression, according, to, james, l, gelvin, nahda, writers, attempted, to, simplify, the, arabic, language, and, script, so, that, it, might, be, accessible, to, a, wider, audience, in, the, wake, of, the, industrial, revolution, and, european, hegemony, and, colonialism, pioneering, arabic, presses, such, as, the, amiri, press, established, by, muhammad, ali, 1819, dramatically, changed, the, diffusion, and, consumption, of, arabic, literature, and, publications, rifa, a, al, tahtawi, proposed, the, establishment, of, madrasat, al, alsun, in, 1836, and, led, a, translation, campaign, that, highlighted, the, need, for, a, lexical, injection, in, arabic, to, suit, concepts, of, the, industrial, and, post, industrial, age, such, as, sayy, rah, automobile, or, b, khirah, steamship, in, response, a, number, of, arabic, academies, modeled, after, the, acad, mie, fran, aise, were, established, with, the, aim, of, developing, standardized, additions, to, the, arabic, lexicon, to, suit, these, transformations, first, in, damascus, 1919, then, in, cairo, 1932, baghdad, 1948, rabat, 1960, amman, 1977, khartum, 1993, and, tunis, 1993, they, review, language, development, monitor, new, words, and, approve, the, inclusion, of, new, words, into, their, published, standard, dictionaries, they, also, publish, old, and, historical, arabic, manuscripts, in, 1997, a, bureau, of, arabization, standardization, was, added, to, the, educational, cultural, and, scientific, organization, of, the, arab, league, these, academies, and, organizations, have, worked, toward, the, arabization, of, the, sciences, creating, terms, in, arabic, to, describe, new, concepts, toward, the, standardization, of, these, new, terms, throughout, the, arabic, speaking, world, and, toward, the, development, of, arabic, as, a, world, language, this, gave, rise, to, what, western, scholars, call, modern, standard, arabic, from, the, 1950s, arabization, became, a, postcolonial, nationalist, policy, in, countries, such, as, tunisia, algeria, morocco, and, sudan, arabic, usually, refers, to, standard, arabic, which, western, linguists, divide, into, classical, arabic, and, modern, standard, arabic, it, could, also, refer, to, any, of, a, variety, of, regional, vernacular, arabic, dialects, which, are, not, necessarily, mutually, intelligible, classical, arabic, is, the, language, found, in, the, quran, used, from, the, period, of, pre, islamic, arabia, to, that, of, the, abbasid, caliphate, classical, arabic, is, prescriptive, according, to, the, syntactic, and, grammatical, norms, laid, down, by, classical, grammarians, such, as, sibawayh, and, the, vocabulary, defined, in, classical, dictionaries, such, as, the, lis, n, al, arab, modern, standard, arabic, msa, largely, follows, the, grammatical, standards, of, classical, arabic, and, uses, much, of, the, same, vocabulary, however, it, has, discarded, some, grammatical, constructions, and, vocabulary, that, no, longer, have, any, counterpart, in, the, spoken, varieties, and, has, adopted, certain, new, constructions, and, vocabulary, from, the, spoken, varieties, much, of, the, new, vocabulary, is, used, to, denote, concepts, that, have, arisen, in, the, industrial, and, post, industrial, era, especially, in, modern, times, due, to, its, grounding, in, classical, arabic, modern, standard, arabic, is, removed, over, a, millennium, from, everyday, speech, which, is, construed, as, a, multitude, of, dialects, of, this, language, these, dialects, and, modern, standard, arabic, are, described, by, some, scholars, as, not, mutually, comprehensible, the, former, are, usually, acquired, in, families, while, the, latter, is, taught, in, formal, education, settings, however, there, have, been, studies, reporting, some, degree, of, comprehension, of, stories, told, in, the, standard, variety, among, preschool, aged, children, the, relation, between, modern, standard, arabic, and, these, dialects, is, sometimes, compared, to, that, of, classical, latin, and, vulgar, latin, vernaculars, which, became, romance, languages, in, medieval, and, early, modern, europe, msa, is, the, variety, used, in, most, current, printed, arabic, publications, spoken, by, some, of, the, arabic, media, across, north, africa, and, the, middle, east, and, understood, by, most, educated, arabic, speakers, literary, arabic, and, standard, arabic, fu, are, less, strictly, defined, terms, that, may, refer, to, modern, standard, arabic, or, classical, arabic, some, of, the, differences, between, classical, arabic, ca, and, modern, standard, arabic, msa, are, as, follows, msa, uses, much, classical, vocabulary, e, g, dhahaba, to, go, that, is, not, present, in, the, spoken, varieties, but, deletes, classical, words, that, sound, obsolete, in, msa, in, addition, msa, has, borrowed, or, coined, many, terms, for, concepts, that, did, not, exist, in, quranic, times, and, msa, continues, to, evolve, some, words, have, been, borrowed, from, other, languages, notice, that, transliteration, mainly, indicates, spelling, and, not, real, pronunciation, e, g, film, film, or, d, muqr, iyyah, democracy, the, current, preference, is, to, avoid, direct, borrowings, preferring,

telephone, invisible, caller, in, sufism, jar, dah, newspaper, palm, leaf, stalk, colloquial, or, dialectal, arabic, refers, to, the, many, national, or, regional, varieties, which, constitute, the, everyday, spoken, language, colloquial, arabic, has, many, regional, variants, geographically, distant, varieties, usually, differ, enough, to, be, mutually, unintelligible, and, some, linguists, consider, them, distinct, languages, however, research, indicates, a, high, degree, of, mutual, intelligibility, between, closely, related, arabic, variants, for, native, speakers, listening, to, words, sentences, and, texts, and, between, more, distantly, related, dialects, in, interactional, situations, the, varieties, are, typically, unwritten, they, are, often, used, in, informal, spoken, media, such, as, soap, operas, and, talk, shows, as, well, as, occasionally, in, certain, forms, of, written, media, such, as, poetry, and, printed, advertising, hassaniya, arabic, maltese, and, cypriot, arabic, are, only, varieties, of, modern, arabic, to, have, acquired, official, recognition, hassaniya, is, official, in, mali, and, recognized, as, a, minority, language, in, morocco, while, the, senegalese, government, adopted, the, latin, script, to, write, it, maltese, is, official, in, predominantly, catholic, malta, and, written, with, the, latin, script, linguists, agree, that, it, is, a, variety, of, spoken, arabic, descended, from, siculo, arabic, though, it, has, experienced, extensive, changes, as, a, result, of, sustained, and, intensive, contact, with, italo, romance, varieties, and, more, recently, also, with, english, due, to, a, mix, of, social, cultural, historical, political, and, indeed, linguistic, factors, many, maltese, people, today, consider, their, language, semitic, but, not, a, type, of, arabic, cypriot, arabic, is, recognized, as, a, minority, language, in, cyprus, the, sociolinguistic, situation, of, arabic, in, modern, times, provides, a, prime, example, of, the, linguistic, phenomenon, of, diglossia, which, is, the, normal, use, of, two, separate, varieties, of, the, same, language, usually, in, different, social, situations, tawleed, is, the, process, of, giving, a, new, shade, of, meaning, to, an, old, classical, word, for, example, al, hatif, lexicographically, means, the, one, whose, sound, is, heard, but, whose, person, remains, unseen, now, the, term, al, hatif, is, used, for, a, telephone, therefore, the, process, of, tawleed, can, express, the, needs, of, modern, civilization, in, a, manner, that, would, appear, to, be, originally, arabic, in, the, case, of, arabic, educated, arabs, of, any, nationality, can, be, assumed, to, speak, both, their, school, taught, standard, arabic, as, well, as, their, native, dialects, which, depending, on, the, region, may, be, mutually, unintelligible, some, of, these, dialects, can, be, considered, to, constitute, separate, languages, which, may, have, sub, dialects, of, their, own, when, educated, arabs, of, different, dialects, engage, in, conversation, for, example, a, moroccan, speaking, with, a, lebanese, many, speakers, code, switch, back, and, forth, between, the, dialectal, and, standard, varieties, of, the, language, sometimes, even, within, the, same, sentence, the, issue, of, whether, arabic, is, one, language, or, many, languages, is, politically, charged, in, the, same, way, it, is, for, the, varieties, of, chinese, hindi, and, urdu, serbian, and, croatian, scots, and, english, etc, in, contrast, to, speakers, of, hindi, and, urdu, who, claim, they, cannot, understand, each, other, even, when, they, can, speakers, of, the, varieties, of, arabic, will, claim, they, can, all, understand, each, other, even, when, they, cannot, while, there, is, a, minimum, level, of, comprehension, between, all, arabic, dialects, this, level, can, increase, or, decrease, based, on, geographic, proximity, for, example, levantine, and, gulf, speakers, understand, each, other, much, better, than, they, do, speakers, from, the, maghreb, the, issue, of, diglossia, between, spoken, and, written, language, is, a, complicating, factor, a, single, written, form, differing, sharply, from, any, of, the, spoken, varieties, learned, natively, unites, several, sometimes, divergent, spoken, forms, for, political, reasons, arabs, mostly, assert, that, they, all, speak, a, single, language, despite, mutual, incomprehensibility, among, differing, spoken, versions, from, a, linguistic, standpoint, it, is, often, said, that, the, various, spoken, varieties, of, arabic, differ, among, each, other, collectively, about, as, much, as, the, romance, languages, this, is, an, apt, comparison, in, a, number, of, ways, the, period, of, divergence, from, a, single, spoken, form, is, similar, perhaps, 1500, years, for, arabic, 2000, years, for, the, romance, languages, also, while, it, is, comprehensible, to, people, from, the, maghreb, a, linguistically, innovative, variety, such, as, moroccan, arabic, is, essentially, incomprehensible, to, arabs, from, the, mashriq, much, as, french, is, incomprehensible, to, spanish, or, italian, speakers, but, relatively, easily, learned, by, them, this, suggests, that, the, spoken, varieties, may, linguistically, be, considered, separate, languages, with, the, sole, example, of, medieval, linguist, abu, hayyan, al, gharnati, who, while, a, scholar, of, the, arabic, language, was, not, ethnically, arab, medieval, scholars, of, the, arabic, language, made, no, efforts, at, studying, comparative, linguistics, considering, all, other, languages, inferior, in, modern, times, the, educated, upper, classes, in, the, arab, world, have, taken, a, nearly, opposite, view, yasir, suleiman, wrote, in, 2011, that, studying, and, knowing, english, or, french, in, most, of, the, middle, east, and, north, africa, have, become, a, badge, of, sophistication, and, modernity, and, feigning, or, asserting, weakness, or, lack, of, facility, in, arabic, is, sometimes, paraded, as, a, sign, of, status, class, and, perversely, even, education, through, a, m, lange, of, code, switching, practises, arabic, has, been, taught, worldwide, in, many, elementary, and, secondary, schools, especially, muslim, schools, universities, around, the, world, have, classes, that, teach, arabic, as, part, of, their, foreign, languages, middle, eastern, studies, and, religious, studies, courses, arabic, language, schools, exist, to, assist, students, to, learn, arabic, outside, the, academic, world, there, are, many, arabic, language, schools, in, the, arab, world, and, other, muslim, countries, because, the, quran, is, written, in, arabic, and, all, islamic, terms, are, in, arabic, millions, of, muslims, both, arab, and, non, arab, study, the, language, software, and, books, with, tapes, are, an, important, part, of, arabic, learning, as, many, of, arabic, learners, may, live, in, places, where, there, are, no, academic, or, arabic, language, school, classes, available, radio, series, of, arabic, language, classes, are, also, provided, from, some, radio, stations, a, number, of, websites, on, the, internet, provide, online, classes, for, all, levels, as, a, means, of, distance, education, most, teach, modern, standard, arabic, but, some, teach, regional,

explain, words, in, the, quran, that, were, unfamiliar, or, had, a, particular, contextual, meaning, and, to, identify, words, of, non, arabic, origin, that, appear, in, the, quran, they, gathered, shaw, hid, instances, of, attested, usage, from, poetry, and, the, speech, of, the, arabs, particularly, the, bedouin, a, r, b, who, were, perceived, to, speak, the, purest, most, eloquent, form, of,

sought, to, publish, a, historical, dictionary, of, arabic, in, the, vein, of, the, oxford, english, dictionary, tracing, the, changes, of, meanings, and, uses, of, arabic, words, over, time, a,

international, language, of, communication, throughout, the, ancient, near, and, middle, east, and, ethiopic, many, cultural, religious, and, political, terms, have, entered, arabic, from, iranian,

the, influence, of, arabic, has, been, most, important, in, islamic, countries, because, it, is, the, language, of, the, islamic, sacred, book, the, quran, arabic, is, also, an, important, source, of, vocabulary, for, languages, such, as, amharic, azerbaijani, baluchi, bengali, berber, bosnian, chaldean, chechen, chittagonian, croatian, dagestani, dhivehi, english, german, gujarati, hausa, hindi, kazakh, kurdish, kutchi, kyrgyz, malay, malaysian, and, indonesian, pashto, persian, punjabi, rohingya, romance, languages, french, catalan, italian, portuguese, sicilian, spanish, etc, saraiki, sindhi, somali, sylheti, swahili, tagalog, tigrinya, turkish, turkmen, urdu, uyghur, uzbek, visayan, and, wolof, as, well, as, other, languages, in, countries, where, these, languages, are, spoken, modern, hebrew, has, been, also, influenced, by, arabic, especially, during, the, process, of, revival, as, msa, was, used, as, a, source, for, modern, hebrew, vocabulary, and, roots, english, has, many, arabic, loanwords, some, directly, but, most, via, other, mediterranean, languages, examples, of, such, words, include, admiral, adobe, alchemy, alcohol, algebra, algorithm, alkaline, almanac, amber, arsenal, assassin, candy, carat, cipher, coffee, cotton, ghoul, hazard, jar, kismet, lemon, loofah, magazine, mattress, sherbet, sofa, sumac, tariff, and, zenith, other, languages, such, as, maltese, and, kinubi, derive, ultimately, from, arabic, rather, than, merely, borrowing, vocabulary, or, grammatical, rules, terms, borrowed, range, from, religious, terminology, like, berber, ta, allit, prayer, from, salat, al, h, academic, terms, like, uyghur, mentiq, logic, and, economic, items, like, english, coffee, to, placeholders, like, spanish, fulano, so, and, so, everyday, terms, like, hindustani, lekin, but, or, spanish, taza, and, french, tasse, meaning, cup, and, expressions, like, catalan, a, betzef, galore, in, quantity, most, berber, varieties, such, as, kabyle, along, with, swahili, borrow, some, numbers, from, arabic, most, islamic, religious, terms, are, direct, borrowings, from, arabic, such, as, al, h, prayer, and, im, m, prayer, leader, in, languages, not, directly, in, contact, with, the, arab, world, arabic, loanwords, are, often, transferred, indirectly, via, other, languages, rather, than, being, transferred, directly, from, arabic, for, example, most, arabic, loanwords, in, hindustani, and, turkish, entered, through, persian, older, arabic, loanwords, in, hausa, were, borrowed, from, kanuri, most, arabic, loanwords, in, yoruba, entered, through, hausa, arabic, words, made, their, way, into, several, west, african, languages, as, islam, spread, across, the, sahara, variants, of, arabic, words, such, as, kit, b, book, have, spread, to, the, languages, of, african, groups, who, had, no, direct, contact, with, arab, traders, since, throughout, the, islamic, world, arabic, occupied, a, position, similar, to, that, of, latin, in, europe, many, of, the, arabic, concepts, in, the, fields, of, science, philosophy, commerce, etc, were, coined, from, arabic, roots, by, non, native, arabic, speakers, notably, by, aramaic, and, persian, translators, and, then, found, their, way, into, other, languages, this, process, of, using, arabic, roots, especially, in, kurdish, and, persian, to, translate, foreign, concepts, continued, through, to, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, when, swaths, of, arab, inhabited, lands, were, under, ottoman, rule, colloquial, arabic, is, a, collective, term, for, the, spoken, dialects, of, arabic, used, throughout, the, arab, world, which, differ, radically, from, the, literary, language, the, main, dialectal, division, is, between, the, varieties, within, and, outside, of, the, arabian, peninsula, followed, by, that, between, sedentary, varieties, and, the, much, more, conservative, bedouin, varieties, all, the, varieties, outside, of, the, arabian, peninsula, which, include, the, large, majority, of, speakers, have, many, features, in, common, with, each, other, that, are, not, found, in, classical, arabic, this, has, led, researchers, to, postulate, the, existence, of, a, prestige, koine, dialect, in, the, one, or, two, centuries, immediately, following, the, arab, conquest, whose, features, eventually, spread, to, all, newly, conquered, areas, these, features, are, present, to, varying, degrees, inside, the, arabian, peninsula, generally, the, arabian, peninsula, varieties, have, much, more, diversity, than, the, non, peninsula, varieties, but, these, have, been, understudied, within, the, non, peninsula, varieties, the, largest, difference, is, between, the, non, egyptian, north, african, dialects, especially, moroccan, arabic, and, the, others, moroccan, arabic, in, particular, is, hardly, comprehensible, to, arabic, speakers, east, of, libya, although, the, converse, is, not, true, in, part, due, to, the, popularity, of, egyptian, films, and, other, media, one, factor, in, the, differentiation, of, the, dialects, is, influence, from, the, languages, previously, spoken, in, the, areas, which, have, typically, provided, many, new, words, and, have, sometimes, also, influenced, pronunciation, or, word, order, however, a, more, weighty, factor, for, most, dialects, is, as, among, romance, languages, retention, or, change, of, meaning, of, different, classical, forms, thus, iraqi, aku, levantine, f, h, and, north, african, kay, n, all, mean, there, is, and, all, come, from, classical, arabic, forms, yak, n, f, hi, k, in, respectively, but, now, sound, very, different, according, to, charles, a, ferguson, the, following, are, some, of, the, characteristic, features, of, the, koin, that, underlies, all, the, modern, dialects, outside, the, arabian, peninsula, although, many, other, features, are, common, to, most, or, all, of, these, varieties, ferguson, believes, that, these, features, in, particular, are, unlikely, to, have, evolved, independently, more, than, once, or, twice, and, together, suggest, the, existence, of, the, koine, while, many, languages, have, numerous, dialects, that, differ, in, phonology, contemporary, spoken, arabic, is, more, properly, described, as, a, continuum, of, varieties, modern, standard, arabic, msa, is, the, standard, variety, shared, by, educated, speakers, throughout, arabic, speaking, regions, msa, is, used, in, writing, in, formal, print, media, and, orally, in, newscasts, speeches, and, formal, declarations, of, numerous, types, modern, standard, arabic, has, 28, consonant, phonemes, and, 6, vowel, phonemes, all, phonemes, contrast, between, emphatic, pharyngealized, consonants, and, non, emphatic, ones, some, of, these, phonemes, have, coalesced, in, the, various, modern, dialects, while, new, phonemes, have, been, introduced, through, borrowing, or, phonemic, splits, a, phonemic, quality, of, length, applies, to, consonants, as, well, as, vowels, the, grammar, of, arabic, has, similarities, with, the, grammar, of, other, semitic, languages, some, of, the, typical, differences, between, standard, arabic, and, vernacular, varieties, are, a, loss, of, morphological, markings, of, grammatical, case, changes, in, word, order, a, shift, toward, more, analytic, morphosyntax, loss, of, grammatical, mood, and, loss, of, the, inflected, passive, voice, as, in, other, semitic, languages, arabic, has, a, complex, and, unusual, morphology, i, e, method, of, constructing, words, from, a, basic, root, arabic, has, a, nonconcatenative, root, and, pattern, morphology, a, root, consists, of, a, set, of, bare, consonants, usually, three, which, are, fitted, into, a, discontinuous, pattern, to, form, words, for, example, the, word, for, i, wrote, is, constructed, by, combining, the, root, k, t, b, write, with, the, pattern, a, a, tu, i, xed, to, form, katabtu, i, wrote, other, verbs, meaning, i, xed, will, typically, have, the, same, pattern, but, with, different, consonants, e, g, qara, tu, i, read, akaltu, i, ate, dhahabtu, i, went, although, other, patterns, are, possible, e, g, sharibtu, i, drank, qultu, i, said, takallamtu, i, spoke, where, the, subpattern, used, to, signal, the, past, tense, may, change, but, the, suffix, tu, is, always, used, from, a, single, root, k, t, b, numerous, words, can, be, formed, by, applying, different, patterns, nouns, in, literary, arabic, have, three, grammatical, cases, nominative, accusative, and, genitive, three, numbers, singular, dual, and, plural, two, genders, masculine, and, feminine, and, three, states, indefinite, definite, and, construct, the, cases, of, singular, nouns, other, than, those, that, end, in, long, are, indicated, by, suffixed, short, vowels, u, for, nominative, a, for, accusative, i, for, genitive, the, feminine, singular, is, often, marked, by, at, which, is, pronounced, as, ah, before, a, pause, plural, is, indicated, either, through, endings, the, sound, plural, or, internal, modification, the, broken, plural, definite, nouns, include, all, proper, nouns, all, nouns, in, construct, state, and, all, nouns, which, are, prefixed, by, the, definite, article, al, indefinite, singular, nouns, other, than, those, that, end, in, long, add, a, final, n, to, the, case, marking, vowels, giving, un, an, or, in, which, is, also, referred, to, as, nunation, or, tanw, n, adjectives, in, literary, arabic, are, marked, for, case, number, gender, and, state, as, for, nouns, the, plural, of, all, non, human, nouns, is, always, combined, with, a, singular, feminine, adjective, which, takes, the, at, suffix, pronouns, in, literary, arabic, are, marked, for, person, number, and, gender, there, are, two, varieties, independent, pronouns, and, enclitics, enclitic, pronouns, are, attached, to, the, end, of, a, verb, noun, or, preposition, and, indicate, verbal, and, prepositional, objects, or, possession, of, nouns, the, first, person, singular, pronoun, has, a, different, enclitic, form, used, for, verbs, n, and, for, nouns, or, prepositions, after, consonants, ya, after, vowels, nouns, verbs, pronouns, and, adjectives, agree, with, each, other, in, all, respects, non, human, plural, nouns, are, grammatically, considered, to, be, feminine, singular, a, verb, in, a, verb, initial, sentence, is, marked, as, singular, regardless, of, its, semantic, number, when, the, subject, of, the, verb, is, explicitly, mentioned, as, a, noun, numerals, between, three, and, ten, show, chiasmic, agreement, in, that, grammatically, masculine, numerals, have, feminine, marking, and, vice, versa, verbs, in, literary, arabic, are, marked, for, person, first, second, or, third, gender, and, number, they, are, conjugated, in, two, major, paradigms, past, and, non, past, two, voices, active, and, passive, and, six, moods, indicative, imperative, subjunctive, jussive, shorter, energetic, and, longer, energetic, the, fifth, and, sixth, moods, the, energetics, exist, only, in, classical, arabic, but, not, in, msa, there, are, two, participles, active, and, passive, and, a, verbal, noun, but, no, infinitive, the, past, and, non, past, paradigms, are, sometimes, termed, perfective, and, imperfective, indicating, the, fact, that, they, actually, represent, a, combination, of, tense, and, aspect, the, moods, other, than, the, indicative, occur, only, in, the, non, past, and, the, future, tense, is, signaled, by, prefixing, sa, or, sawfa, onto, the, non, past, the, past, and, non, past, differ, in, the, form, of, the, stem, e, g, past, katab, vs, non, past, ktub, and, use, completely, different, sets, of, affixes, for, indicating, person, number, and, gender, in, the, past, the, person, number, and, gender, are, fused, into, a, single, suffixal, morpheme, while, in, the, non, past, a, combination, of, prefixes, primarily, encoding, person, and, suffixes, primarily, encoding, gender, and, number, are, used, the, passive, voice, uses, the, same, person, number, gender, affixes, but, changes, the, vowels, of, the, stem, the, following, shows, a, paradigm, of, a, regular, arabic, verb, kataba, to, write, in, modern, standard, the, energetic, mood, in, either, long, or, short, form, which, has, the, same, meaning, is, almost, never, used, like, other, semitic, languages, and, unlike, most, other, languages, arabic, makes, much, more, use, of, nonconcatenative, morphology, applying, many, templates, applied, to, roots, to, derive, words, than, adding, prefixes, or, suffixes, to, words, for, verbs, a, given, root, can, occur, in, many, different, derived, verb, stems, of, which, there, are, about, fifteen, each, with, one, or, more, characteristic, meanings, and, each, with, its, own, templates, for, the, past, and, non, past, stems, active, and, passive, participles, and, verbal, noun, these, are, referred, to, by, western, scholars, as, form, i, form, ii, and, so, on, through, form, xv, although, forms, xi, to, xv, are, rare, these, stems, encode, grammatical, functions, such, as, the, causative, intensive, and, reflexive, stems, sharing, the, same, root, consonants, represent, separate, verbs, albeit, often, semantically, related, and, each, is, the, basis, for, its, own, conjugational, paradigm, as, a, result, these, derived, stems, are, part, of, the, system, of, derivational, morphology, not, part, of, the, inflectional, system, examples, of, the, different, verbs, formed, from, the, root, k, t, b, write, using, m, r, red, for, form, ix, which, is, limited, to, colors, and, physical, defects, form, ii, is, sometimes, used, to, create, transitive, denominative, verbs, verbs, built, from, nouns, form, v, is, the, equivalent, used, for, intransitive, denominatives, the, associated, participles, and, verbal, nouns, of, a, verb, are, the, primary, means, of, forming, new, lexical, nouns, in, arabic, this, is, similar, to, the, process, by, which, for, example, the, english, gerund, meeting, similar, to, a, verbal, noun, has, turned, into, a, noun, referring, to, a, particular, type, of, social, often, work, related, event, where, people, gather, together, to, have, a, discussion, another, lexicalized, verbal, noun, another, fairly, common, means, of, forming, nouns, is, through, one, of, a, limited, number, of, patterns, that, can, be, applied, directly, to, roots, such, as, the, nouns, of, location, in, ma, e, g, maktab, desk, office, k, t, b, write, ma, bakh, kitchen, b, kh, cook, the, only, three, genuine, suffixes, are, as, follows, the, spoken, dialects, have, lost, the, case, distinctions, and, make, only, limited, use, of, the, dual, it, occurs, only, on, nouns, and, its, use, is, no, longer, required, in, all, circumstances, they, have, lost, the, mood, distinctions, other, than, imperative, but, many, have, since, gained, new, moods, through, the, use, of, prefixes, most, often, bi, for, indicative, vs, unmarked, subjunctive, they, have, also, mostly, lost, the, indefinite, nunation, and, the, internal, passive, the, following, is, an, example, of, a, regular, verb, paradigm, in, egyptian, arabic, the, arabic, alphabet, derives, from, the, aramaic, through, nabatean, to, which, it, bears, a, loose, resemblance, like, that, of, coptic, or, cyrillic, scripts, to, greek, script, traditionally, there, were, several, differences, between, the, western, north, african, and, middle, eastern, versions, of, the, alphabet, in, particular, the, fa, had, a, dot, underneath, and, qaf, a, single, dot, above, in, the, maghreb, and, the, order, of, the, letters, was, slightly, different, at, least, when, they, were, used, as, numerals, however, the, old, maghrebi, variant, has, been, abandoned, except, for, calligraphic, purposes, in, the, maghreb, itself, and, remains, in, use, mainly, in, the, quranic, schools, zaouias, of, west, africa, arabic, like, all, other, semitic, languages, except, for, the, latin, written, maltese, and, the, languages, with, the, ge, ez, script, is, written, from, right, to, left, there, are, several, styles, of, scripts, such, as, thuluth, muhaqqaq, tawqi, rayhan, and, notably, naskh, which, is, used, in, print, and, by, computers, and, ruq, ah, which, is, commonly, used, for, correspondence, originally, arabic, was, made, up, of, only, rasm, without, diacritical, marks, later, diacritical, points, which, in, arabic, are, referred, to, as, nuqa, were, added, which, allowed, readers, to, distinguish, between, letters, such, as, b, t, th, n, and, y, finally, signs, known, as, tashkil, were, used, for, short, vowels, known, as, harakat, and, other, uses, such, as, final, postnasalized, or, long, vowels, after, khalil, ibn, ahmad, al, farahidi, finally, fixed, the, arabic, script, around, 786, many, styles, were, developed, both, for, the, writing, down, of, the, quran, and, other, books, and, for, inscriptions, on, monuments, as, decoration, arabic, calligraphy, has, not, fallen, out, of, use, as, calligraphy, has, in, the, western, world, and, is, still, considered, by, arabs, as, a, major, art, form, calligraphers, are, held, in, great, esteem, being, cursive, by, nature, unlike, the, latin, script, arabic, script, is, used, to, write, down, a, verse, of, the, quran, a, hadith, or, a, proverb, the, composition, is, often, abstract, but, sometimes, the, writing, is, shaped, into, an, actual, form, such, as, that, of, an, animal, one, of, the, current, masters, of, the, genre, is, hassan, massoudy, in, modern, times, the, intrinsically, calligraphic, nature, of, the, written, arabic, form, is, haunted, by, the, thought, that, a, typographic, approach, to, the, language, necessary, for, digitized, unification, will, not, always, accurately, maintain, meanings, conveyed, through, calligraphy, there, are, a, number, of, different, standards, for, the, romanization, of, arabic, i, e, methods, of, accurately, and, efficiently, representing, arabic, with, the, latin, script, there, are, various, conflicting, motivations, involved, which, leads, to, multiple, systems, some, are, interested, in, transliteration, i, e, representing, the, spelling, of, arabic, while, others, focus, on, transcription, i, e, representing, the, pronunciation, of, arabic, they, differ, in, that, for, example, the, same, letter, is, used, to, represent, both, a, consonant, as, in, y, ou, or, y, et, and, a, vowel, as, in, m, e, or, ea, t, some, systems, e, g, for, scholarly, use, are, intended, to, accurately, and, unambiguously, represent, the, phonemes, of, arabic, generally, making, the, phonetics, more, explicit, than, the, original, word, in, the, arabic, script, these, systems, are, heavily, reliant, on, diacritical, marks, such, as, for, the, sound, equivalently, written, sh, in, english, other, systems, e, g, the, bah, orthography, are, intended, to, help, readers, who, are, neither, arabic, speakers, nor, linguists, with, intuitive, pronunciation, of, arabic, names, and, phrases, these, less, scientific, systems, tend, to, avoid, diacritics, and, use, digraphs, like, sh, and, kh, these, are, usually, simpler, to, read, but, sacrifice, the, definiteness, of, the, scientific, systems, and, may, lead, to, ambiguities, e, g, whether, to, interpret, sh, as, a, single, sound, as, in, gash, or, a, combination, of, two, sounds, as, in, gashouse, the, ala, lc, romanization, solves, this, problem, by, separating, the, two, sounds, with, a, prime, symbol, e, g, as, hal, easier, during, the, last, few, decades, and, especially, since, the, 1990s, western, invented, text, communication, technologies, have, become, prevalent, in, the, arab, world, such, as, personal, computers, the, world, wide, web, email, bulletin, board, systems, irc, instant, messaging, and, mobile, phone, text, messaging, most, of, these, technologies, originally, had, the, ability, to, communicate, using, the, latin, script, only, and, some, of, them, still, do, not, have, the, arabic, script, as, an, optional, feature, as, a, result, arabic, speaking, users, communicated, in, these, technologies, by, transliterating, the, arabic, text, using, the, latin, script, to, handle, those, arabic, letters, that, cannot, be, accurately, represented, using, the, latin, script, numerals, and, other, characters, were, appropriated, for, example, the, numeral, 3, may, be, used, to, represent, the, arabic, letter, there, is, no, universal, name, for, this, type, of, transliteration, but, some, have, named, it, arabic, chat, alphabet, or, im, arabic, other, systems, of, transliteration, exist, such, as, using, dots, or, capitalization, to, represent, the, emphatic, counterparts, of, certain, consonants, for, instance, using, capitalization, the, letter, may, be, represented, by, d, its, emphatic, counterpart, may, be, written, as, d, in, most, of, present, day, north, africa, the, western, arabic, numerals, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, are, used, however, in, egypt, and, arabic, speaking, countries, to, the, east, of, it, the, eastern, arabic, numerals, are, in, use, when, representing, a, number, in, arabic, the, lowest, valued, position, is, placed, on, the, right, so, the, order, of, positions, is, the, same, as, in, left, to, right, scripts, sequences, of, digits, such, as, telephone, numbers, are, read, from, left, to, right, but, numbers, are, spoken, in, the, traditional, arabic, fashion, with, units, and, tens, reversed,

into, latin, script, or, to, romanize, the, language, currently, the, only, arabic, variety, to, use, latin, script, is, maltese, the, beirut, newspaper, la, syrie, pushed, for, the, change, from, arabic, script, to, latin, letters, in, 1922, the, major, head, of, this, movement, was, louis, massignon, a, french, orientalist, who, brought, his, concern, before, the, arabic, language, academy, in, damascus, in, 1928, massignon, s, attempt, at, romanization, failed, as, the, academy, and, population, viewed, the, proposal, as, an, attempt, from, the, western, world, to, take, over, their,

colloquial, arabic, would, be, combined, into, one, language, and, the, latin, alphabet, would, be, used, there, was, also, the, idea, of, finding, a, way, to, use, hieroglyphics, instead, of, the, latin, alphabet, but, this, was, seen, as, too, complicated, to, use, a, scholar, salama, musa, agreed, with, the, idea, of, applying, a, latin, alphabet, to, arabic, as, he, believed, that, would, allow, egypt, to, have, a, closer, relationship, with, the, west, he, also, believed, that, latin, script, was, key, to, the, success, of, egypt, as, it, would, allow, for, more, advances, in,

words, that, made, it, difficult, for, non, native, speakers, to, learn, ahmad, lutfi, as, sayid, and, muhammad, azmi, two, egyptian, intellectuals, agreed, with, musa, and, supported, the, push, for,

and, grammar, committee, for, the, arabic, language, academy, of, cairo, this, effort, failed, as, the, egyptian, people, felt, a, strong, cultural, tie, to, the, arabic, alphabet, in, particular, the, older, egyptian, generations, believed, that, the, arabic, alphabet, had, strong, connections, to, arab, values, and, history, due, to, the, long, history, of, the, arabic, alphabet, shrivtiel,
