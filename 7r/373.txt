west, caucasian, east, caucasian, the, north, caucasian, languages, sometimes, called, simply, caucasic, is, a, proposed, language, family, consisting, of, a, pair, of, well, established, language, families, spoken, in, the, caucasus, predominantly, in, the, north, consisting, of, the, northwest, caucasian, family, also, called, pontic, abkhaz, adyghe, circassian, or, west, caucasian, and, the, northeast, caucasian, family, also, called, nakh, dagestanian, caspian, or, east, caucasian, there, are, some, 34, to, 38, distinct, north, caucasian, languages, the, kartvelian, languages, including, georgian, zan, and, svan, were, once, known, as, south, caucasian, however, they, are, no, longer, considered, related, to, the, north, caucasian, languages, and, are, classified, as, an, independent, language, family, some, linguists, notably, sergei, starostin, and, sergei, nikolaev, believe, that, the, two, groups, sprang, from, a, common, ancestor, about, five, thousand, years, bce, however, this, proposal, is, difficult, to, evaluate, and, remains, controversial, north, caucasian, has, also, been, given, in, an, automated, computational, analysis, asjp, 4, by, m, ller, et, al, 2013, however, since, the, analysis, was, automatically, generated, m, ller, et, al, 2013, does, not, conclude, whether, the, grouping, is, due, to, mutual, lexical, borrowing, or, genetic, inheritance, among, the, linguists, who, support, the, north, caucasian, hypothesis, the, main, split, between, northeast, caucasian, and, northwest, caucasian, is, considered, uncontroversial, problems, arise, when, it, gets, to, the, internal, structure, of, northeast, caucasian, itself, so, far, no, general, agreement, has, been, reached, in, this, respect, the, following, classification, is, based, on, nikolayev, starostin, 1994, the, main, perceived, similarities, between, the, two, phyla, lie, in, their, phonological, systems, however, their, grammars, are, quite, different, both, phyla, are, characterised, by, high, levels, of, phonetic, complexity, including, the, widespread, usage, of, secondary, articulation, ubykh, northwest, has, 84, consonants, and, archi, northeast, is, thought, to, have, 76, a, list, of, possible, cognates, has, been, proposed, however, most, of, them, may, be, loanwords, or, simply, coincidences, since, most, of, the, morphemes, in, both, phyla, are, quite, short, often, just, a, single, consonant, the, northeast, caucasian, languages, are, characterised, by, great, morphological, complexity, in, the, noun, for, example, in, tsez, a, series, of, locative, cases, intersect, with, a, series, of, suffixes, designating, motion, with, regard, to, the, location, producing, an, array, of, 126, locative, suffixes, often, depending, on, the, analysis, described, as, noun, cases, by, contrast, the, northwest, caucasian, noun, systems, are, relatively, poor, in, morphology, usually, distinguishing, just, two, or, three, cases, however, they, make, up, with, a, very, complex, verbal, structure, the, subject, the, direct, object, the, indirect, object, benefactive, objects, and, most, local, functions, are, expressed, in, the, verb, abbreviations, pn, proto, nakh, pdl, proto, dargi, lak, plk, proto, lezgic, khinalugh, paat, proto, avar, andic, tsezic, pnec, proto, northeast, caucasian, pnwc, proto, northwest, caucasian, pnc, proto, north, caucasian, i, inclusive, e, exclusive, abbreviations, pnec, s, schulze, pnec, n, nichols, pnwc, ch, chirikba, pnwc, co, colarusso, pnc, s, starostin, nikolayev, not, all, scholars, accept, the, unity, of, the, north, caucasian, languages, and, some, who, do, believe, that, the, two, are, or, may, be, related, do, not, accept, the, methodology, used, by, nikolayev, and, starostin
