corporations, come, in, many, different, types, but, are, usually, divided, by, the, law, of, the, jurisdiction, where, they, are, chartered, based, on, two, aspects, whether, they, can, issue, stock, or, whether, they, are, formed, to, make, a, profit, depending, on, the, number, of, owners, a, corporation, can, be, classified, as, aggregate, the, subject, of, this, article, or, sole, a, legal,

shares, are, owned, by, shareholders, whose, liability, is, generally, limited, to, their, investment, one, of, the, attractive, early, advantages, business, corporations, offered, to, their, investors, compared, to, earlier, business, entities, like, sole, proprietorships, and, joint, partnerships, was, limited, liability, limited, liability, separates, control, of, a, company, from,

involuntary, harms, committed, by, the, corporation, against, a, third, party, acts, done, by, the, controllers, of, the, corporation, where, local, law, distinguishes, corporations, by, their,

most, circumstances, a, shareholder, may, also, serve, as, a, director, or, officer, of, a, corporation, countries, with, co, determination, employ, the, practice, of, workers, of, an, enterprise, having, the, right, to, vote, for, representatives, on, the, board, of, directors, in, a, company, the, word, corporation, derives, from, corpus, the, latin, word, for, body, or, a, body, of, people, by, the, time, of, justinian, reigned, 527, 565, roman, law, recognized, a, range, of, corporate, entities, under, the, names, universitas, corpus, or, collegium, following, the, passage, of, the, lex, julia, during, the, reign, of, julius, caesar, as, consul, and, dictator, of, the, roman, republic, 49, 44, bc, and, their, reaffirmation, during, the, reign, of, caesar, augustus, as, princeps, senatus, and, imperator, of, the, roman, army, 27, bc, 14, ad, collegia, required, the, approval, of, the, roman, senate, or, the, emperor, in, order, to, be, authorized, as, legal, bodies, these, included, the, state, itself, the, populus, romanus, municipalities, and, such, private, associations, as, sponsors, of, a, religious, cult, burial, clubs, political, groups, and, guilds, of, craftsmen, or, traders, such, bodies, commonly, had, the, right, to, own, property, and, make, contracts, to, receive, gifts, and, legacies, to, sue, and, be, sued, and, in, general, to, perform, legal, acts, through, representatives, private, associations, were, granted, designated, privileges, and, liberties, by, the, emperor, the, concept, of, the, corporation, was, revived, in, the, middle, ages, with, the, recovery, and, annotation, of, justinian, s, corpus, juris, civilis, by, the, glossators, and, their, successors, the, commentators, in, the, 11th, 14th, centuries, particularly, important, in, this, respect, were, the, italian, jurists, bartolus, de, saxoferrato, and, baldus, de, ubaldis, the, latter, of, whom, connected, the, corporation, to, the, metaphor, of, the, body, politic, to, describe, the, state, early, entities, which, carried, on, business, and, were, the, subjects, of, legal, rights, included, the, collegium, of, ancient, rome, and, the, sreni, of, the, maurya, empire, in, ancient, india, in, medieval, europe, churches, became, incorporated, as, did, local, governments, such, as, the, city, of, london, corporation, the, point, was, that, the, incorporation, would, survive, longer, than, the, lives, of, any, particular, member, existing, in, perpetuity, the, alleged, oldest, commercial, corporation, in, the, world, the, stora, kopparberg, mining, community, in, falun, sweden, obtained, a, charter, from, king, magnus, eriksson, in, 1347, in, medieval, times, traders, would, do, business, through, common, law, constructs, such, as, partnerships, whenever, people, acted, together, with, a, view, to, profit, the, law, deemed, that, a, partnership, arose, early, guilds, and, livery, companies, were, also, often, involved, in, the, regulation, of, competition, between, traders, dutch, and, english, chartered, companies, such, as, the, dutch, east, india, company, voc, and, the, hudson, s, bay, company, were, created, to, lead, the, colonial, ventures, of, european, nations, in, the, 17th, century, acting, under, a, charter, sanctioned, by, the, dutch, government, the, dutch, east, india, company, defeated, portuguese, forces, and, established, itself, in, the, moluccan, islands, in, order, to, profit, from, the, european, demand, for, spices, investors, in, the, voc, were, issued, paper, certificates, as, proof, of, share, ownership, and, were, able, to, trade, their, shares, on, the, original, amsterdam, stock, exchange, shareholders, were, also, explicitly, granted, limited, liability, in, the, company, s, royal, charter, in, england, the, government, created, corporations, under, a, royal, charter, or, an, act, of, parliament, with, the, grant, of, a, monopoly, over, a, specified, territory, the, best, known, example, established, in, 1600, was, the, east, india, company, of, london, queen, elizabeth, i, granted, it, the, exclusive, right, to, trade, with, all, countries, to, the, east, of, the, cape, of, good, hope, some, corporations, at, this, time, would, act, on, the, government, s, behalf, bringing, in, revenue, from, its, exploits, abroad, subsequently, the, company, became, increasingly, integrated, with, english, and, later, british, military, and, colonial, policy, just, as, most, corporations, were, essentially, dependent, on, the, royal, navy, s, ability, to, control, trade, routes, labeled, by, both, contemporaries, and, historians, as, the, grandest, society, of, merchants, in, the, universe, the, english, east, india, company, would, come, to, symbolize, the, dazzlingly, rich, potential, of, the, corporation, as, well, as, new, methods, of, business, that, could, be, both, brutal, and, exploitative, on, 31, december, 1600, queen, elizabeth, i, granted, the, company, a, 15, year, monopoly, on, trade, to, and, from, the, east, indies, and, africa, by, 1711, shareholders, in, the, east, india, company, were, earning, a, return, on, their, investment, of, almost, 150, per, cent, subsequent, stock, offerings, demonstrated, just, how, lucrative, the, company, had, become, its, first, stock, offering, in, 1713, 1716, raised, 418, 000, its, second, in, 1717, 1722, raised, 1, 6, million, a, similar, chartered, company, the, south, sea, company, was, established, in, 1711, to, trade, in, the, spanish, south, american, colonies, but, met, with, less, success, the, south, sea, company, s, monopoly, rights, were, supposedly, backed, by, the, treaty, of, utrecht, signed, in, 1713, as, a, settlement, following, the, war, of, the, spanish, succession, which, gave, great, britain, an, asiento, to, trade, in, the, region, for, thirty, years, in, fact, the, spanish, remained, hostile, and, let, only, one, ship, a, year, enter, unaware, of, the, problems, investors, in, britain, enticed, by, extravagant, promises, of, profit, from, company, promoters, bought, thousands, of, shares, by, 1717, the, south, sea, company, was, so, wealthy, still, having, done, no, real, business, that, it, assumed, the, public, debt, of, the, british, government, this, accelerated, the, inflation, of, the, share, price, further, as, did, the, bubble, act, 1720, which, possibly, with, the, motive, of, protecting, the, south, sea, company, from, competition, prohibited, the, establishment, of, any, companies, without, a, royal, charter, the, share, price, rose, so, rapidly, that, people, began, buying, shares, merely, in, order, to, sell, them, at, a, higher, price, which, in, turn, led, to, higher, share, prices, this, was, the, first, speculative, bubble, the, country, had, seen, but, by, the, end, of, 1720, the, bubble, had, burst, and, the, share, price, sank, from, 1, 000, to, under, 100, as, bankruptcies, and, recriminations, ricocheted, through, government, and, high, society, the, mood, against, corporations, and, errant, directors, was, bitter, in, the, late, 18th, century, stewart, kyd, the, author, of, the, first, treatise, on, corporate, law, in, english, defined, a, corporation, as, a, collection, of, many, individuals, united, into, one, body, under, a, special, denomination, having, perpetual, succession, under, an, artificial, form, and, vested, by, the, policy, of, the, law, with, the, capacity, of, acting, in, several, respects, as, an, individual, particularly, of, taking, and, granting, property, of, contracting, obligations, and, of, suing, and, being, sued, of, enjoying, privileges, and, immunities, in, common, and, of, exercising, a, variety, of, political, rights, more, or, less, extensive, according, to, the, design, of, its, institution, or, the, powers, conferred, upon, it, either, at, the, time, of, its, creation, or, at, any, subsequent, period, of, its, existence, due, to, the, late, 18th, century, abandonment, of, mercantilist, economic, theory, and, the, rise, of, classical, liberalism, and, laissez, faire, economic, theory, due, to, a, revolution, in, economics, led, by, adam, smith, and, other, economists, corporations, transitioned, from, being, government, or, guild, affiliated, entities, to, being, public, and, private, economic, entities, free, of, governmental, directions, smith, wrote, in, his, 1776, work, the, wealth, of, nations, that, mass, corporate, activity, could, not, match, private, entrepreneurship, because, people, in, charge, of, others, money, would, not, exercise, as, much, care, as, they, would, with, their, own, the, british, bubble, act, 1720s, prohibition, on, establishing, companies, remained, in, force, until, its, repeal, in, 1825, by, this, point, the, industrial, revolution, had, gathered, pace, pressing, for, legal, change, to, facilitate, business, activity, the, repeal, was, the, beginning, of, a, gradual, lifting, on, restrictions, though, business, ventures, such, as, those, chronicled, by, charles, dickens, in, martin, chuzzlewit, under, primitive, companies, legislation, were, often, scams, without, cohesive, regulation, proverbial, operations, like, the, anglo, bengalee, disinterested, loan, and, life, assurance, company, were, undercapitalized, ventures, promising, no, hope, of, success, except, for, richly, paid, promoters, the, process, of, incorporation, was, possible, only, through, a, royal, charter, or, a, private, act, and, was, limited, owing, to, parliament, s, jealous, protection, of, the, privileges, and, advantages, thereby, granted, as, a, result, many, businesses, came, to, be, operated, as, unincorporated, associations, with, possibly, thousands, of, members, any, consequent, litigation, had, to, be, carried, out, in, the, joint, names, of, all, the, members, and, was, almost, impossibly, cumbersome, though, parliament, would, sometimes, grant, a, private, act, to, allow, an, individual, to, represent, the, whole, in, legal, proceedings, this, was, a, narrow, and, necessarily, costly, expedient, allowed, only, to, established, companies, then, in, 1843, william, gladstone, became, the, chairman, of, a, parliamentary, committee, on, joint, stock, companies, which, led, to, the, joint, stock, companies, act, 1844, regarded, as, the, first, modern, piece, of, company, law, the, act, created, the, registrar, of, joint, stock, companies, empowered, to, register, companies, by, a, two, stage, process, the, first, provisional, stage, cost, 5, and, did, not, confer, corporate, status, which, arose, after, completing, the, second, stage, for, another, 5, for, the, first, time, in, history, it, was, possible, for, ordinary, people, through, a, simple, registration, procedure, to, incorporate, the, advantage, of, establishing, a, company, as, a, separate, legal, person, was, mainly, administrative, as, a, unified, entity, under, which, the, rights, and, duties, of, all, investors, and, managers, could, be, channeled, however, there, was, still, no, limited, liability, and, company, members, could, still, be, held, responsible, for, unlimited, losses, by, the, company, the, next, crucial, development, then, was, the, limited, liability, act, 1855, passed, at, the, behest, of, the, then, vice, president, of, the, board, of, trade, robert, lowe, this, allowed, investors, to, limit, their, liability, in, the, event, of, business, failure, to, the, amount, they, invested, in, the, company, shareholders, were, still, liable, directly, to, creditors, but, just, for, the, unpaid, portion, of, their, shares, the, principle, that, shareholders, are, liable, to, the, corporation, had, been, introduced, in, the, joint, stock, companies, act, 1844, the, 1855, act, allowed, limited, liability, to, companies, of, more, than, 25, members, shareholders, insurance, companies, were, excluded, from, the, act, though, it, was, standard, practice, for, insurance, contracts, to, exclude, action, against, individual, members, limited, liability, for, insurance, companies, was, allowed, by, the, companies, act, 1862, this, prompted, the, english, periodical, the, economist, to, write, in, 1855, that, never, perhaps, was, a, change, so, vehemently, and, generally, demanded, of, which, the, importance, was, so, much, overrated, the, major, error, of, this, judgment, was, recognised, by, the, same, magazine, more, than, 70, years, later, when, it, claimed, that, he, economic, historian, of, the, future, may, be, inclined, to, assign, to, the, nameless, inventor, of, the, principle, of, limited, liability, as, applied, to, trade, corporations, a, place, of, honour, with, watt, and, stephenson, and, other, pioneers, of, the, industrial, revolution, these, two, features, a, simple, registration, procedure, and, limited, liability, were, subsequently, codified, into, the, landmark, 1856, joint, stock, companies, act, this, was, subsequently, consolidated, with, a, number, of, other, statutes, in, the, companies, act, 1862, which, remained, in, force, for, the, rest, of, the, century, up, to, and, including, the, time, of, the, decision, in, salomon, v, a, salomon, co, ltd, the, legislation, shortly, gave, way, to, a, railway, boom, and, from, then, the, numbers, of, companies, formed, soared, in, the, later, nineteenth, century, depression, took, hold, and, just, as, company, numbers, had, boomed, many, began, to, implode, and, fall, into, insolvency, much, strong, academic, legislative, and, judicial, opinion, was, opposed, to, the, notion, that, businessmen, could, escape, accountability, for, their, role, in, the, failing, businesses, in, 1892, germany, introduced, the, gesellschaft, mit, beschr, nkter, haftung, with, a, separate, legal, personality, and, limited, liability, even, if, all, the, shares, of, the, company, were, held, by, only, one, person, this, inspired, other, countries, to, introduce, corporations, of, this, kind, the, last, significant, development, in, the, history, of, companies, was, the, 1897, decision, of, the, house, of, lords, in, salomon, v, salomon, co, where, the, house, of, lords, confirmed, the, separate, legal, personality, of, the, company, and, that, the, liabilities, of, the, company, were, separate, and, distinct, from, those, of, its, owners, in, the, united, states, forming, a, corporation, usually, required, an, act, of, legislation, until, the, late, 19th, century, many, private, firms, such, as, carnegie, s, steel, company, and, rockefeller, s, standard, oil, avoided, the, corporate, model, for, this, reason, as, a, trust, state, governments, began, to, adopt, more, permissive, corporate, laws, from, the, early, 19th, century, although, these, were, all, restrictive, in, design, often, with, the, intention, of, preventing, corporations, from, gaining, too, much, wealth, and, power, new, jersey, was, the, first, state, to, adopt, an, enabling, corporate, law, with, the, goal, of, attracting, more, business, to, the, state, in, 1896, in, 1899, delaware, followed, new, jersey, s, lead, with, the, enactment, of, an, enabling, corporate, statute, but, delaware, only, became, the, leading, corporate, state, after, the, enabling, provisions, of, the, 1896, new, jersey, corporate, law, were, repealed, in, 1913, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, saw, the, emergence, of, holding, companies, and, corporate, mergers, creating, larger, corporations, with, dispersed, shareholders, countries, began, enacting, antitrust, laws, to, prevent, anti, competitive, practices, and, corporations, were, granted, more, legal, rights, and, protections, the, 20th, century, saw, a, proliferation, of, laws, allowing, for, the, creation, of, corporations, by, registration, across, the, world, which, helped, to, drive, economic, booms, in, many, countries, before, and, after, world, war, i, another, major, post, world, war, i, shift, was, toward, the, development, of, conglomerates, in, which, large, corporations, purchased, smaller, corporations, to, expand, their, industrial, base, starting, in, the, 1980s, many, countries, with, large, state, owned, corporations, moved, toward, privatization, the, selling, of, publicly, owned, or, nationalised, services, and, enterprises, to, corporations, deregulation, reducing, the, regulation, of, corporate, activity, often, accompanied, privatization, as, part, of, a, laissez, faire, policy, a, corporation, is, at, least, in, theory, owned, and, controlled, by, its, members, in, a, joint, stock, company, the, members, are, known, as, shareholders, and, each, of, their, shares, in, the, ownership, control, and, profits, of, the, corporation, is, determined, by, the, portion, of, shares, in, the, company, that, they, own, thus, a, person, who, owns, a, quarter, of, the, shares, of, a, joint, stock, company, owns, a, quarter, of, the, company, is, entitled, to, a, quarter, of, the, profit, or, at, least, a, quarter, of, the, profit, given, to, shareholders, as, dividends, and, has, a, quarter, of, the, votes, capable, of, being, cast, at, general, meetings, in, another, kind, of, corporation, the, legal, document, which, established, the, corporation, or, which, contains, its, current, rules, will, determine, the, requirements, for, membership, in, the, corporation, what, these, requirements, are, depends, on, the, kind, of, corporation, involved, in, a, worker, cooperative, the, members, are, people, who, work, for, the, cooperative, in, a, credit, union, the, members, are, people, who, have, accounts, with, the, credit, union, the, day, to, day, activities, of, a, corporation, are, typically, controlled, by, individuals, appointed, by, the, members, in, some, cases, this, will, be, a, single, individual, but, more, commonly, corporations, are, controlled, by, a, committee, or, by, committees, broadly, speaking, there, are, two, kinds, of, committee, structure, in, countries, with, co, determination, such, as, in, germany, workers, elect, a, fixed, fraction, of, the, corporation, s, board, historically, corporations, were, created, by, a, charter, granted, by, the, government, today, corporations, are, usually, registered, with, the, state, province, or, national, government, and, regulated, by, the, laws, enacted, by, that, government, registration, is, the, main, prerequisite, to, the, corporation, s, assumption, of, limited, liability, the, law, sometimes, requires, the, corporation, to, designate, its, principal, address, as, well, as, a, registered, agent, a, person, or, company, designated, to, receive, legal, service, of, process, it, may, also, be, required, to, designate, an, agent, or, other, legal, representatives, of, the, corporation, generally, a, corporation, files, articles, of, incorporation, with, the, government, laying, out, the, general, nature, of, the, corporation, the, amount, of, stock, it, is, authorized, to, issue, and, the, names, and, addresses, of, directors, once, the, articles, are, approved, the, corporation, s, directors, meet, to, create, bylaws, that, govern, the, internal, functions, of, the, corporation, such, as, meeting, procedures, and, officer, positions, in, theory, a, corporation, cannot, own, its, own, stock, an, exception, is, treasury, stock, where, the, company, essentially, buys, back, stock, from, its, shareholders, which, reduces, its, outstanding, shares, this, essentially, becomes, the, equivalent, of, unissued, capital, where, it, is, not, classified, as, an, asset, on, the, balance, sheet, passive, capital, the, law, of, the, jurisdiction, in, which, a, corporation, operates, will, regulate, most, of, its, internal, activities, as, well, as, its, finances, if, a, corporation, operates, outside, its, home, state, it, is, often, required, to, register, with, other, governments, as, a, foreign, corporation, and, is, almost, always, subject, to, laws, of, its, host, state, pertaining, to, employment, crimes, contracts, civil, actions, and, the, like, a, corporation, s, spatio, temporal, positioning, is, legislatively, arbitrary, to, its, formation, often, the, market, defines, these, boundaries, according, to, the, invisible, hand, theory, instead, the, two, elements, of, a, corporation, that, define, its, legislative, identity, and, are, therefore, nonarbitrary, delimitations, to, its, formation, and, existence, are, which, jurisdiction, or, sets, of, jurisdictions, in, the, case, of, international, corporations, it, belongs, to, and, what, subject, area, or, areas, it, performs, activities, within, corporations, generally, have, a, distinct, name, historically, some, corporations, were, named, after, the, members, of, their, boards, of, directors, for, example, the, president, and, fellows, of, harvard, college, is, the, name, of, one, of, the, two, governing, boards, of, harvard, university, but, it, is, also, the, exact, name, under, which, harvard, was, legally, incorporated, nowadays, corporations, in, most, jurisdictions, have, a, distinct, name, that, does, not, need, to, make, reference, to, the, members, of, their, boards, in, canada, this, possibility, is, taken, to, its, logical, extreme, many, smaller, canadian, corporations, have, no, names, at, all, merely, numbers, based, on, a, registration, number, for, example, 12345678, ontario, limited, which, is, assigned, by, the, provincial, or, territorial, government, where, the, corporation, incorporates, in, most, countries, corporate, names, include, a, term, or, an, abbreviation, that, denotes, the, corporate, status, of, the, entity, for, example, incorporated, or, inc, in, the, united, states, or, the, limited, liability, of, its, members, for, example, limited, ltd, or, llc, these, terms, vary, by, jurisdiction, and, language, in, some, jurisdictions, they, are, mandatory, and, in, others, such, as, california, they, are, not, their, use, puts, everybody, on, constructive, notice, that, they, are, dealing, with, an, entity, whose, liability, is, limited, one, can, only, collect, from, whatever, assets, the, entity, still, controls, when, one, obtains, a, judgment, against, it, some, jurisdictions, do, not, allow, the, use, of, the, word, company, alone, to, denote, corporate, status, since, the, word, company, may, refer, to, a, partnership, or, some, other, form, of, collective, ownership, in, the, united, states, it, can, be, used, by, a, sole, proprietorship, but, this, is, not, generally, the, case, elsewhere, despite, not, being, human, beings, corporations, have, been, ruled, legal, persons, in, a, few, countries, and, have, many, of, the, same, rights, as, natural, persons, do, for, example, a, corporation, can, own, property, and, can, sue, or, be, sued, for, as, long, as, it, exists, corporations, can, exercise, human, rights, against, real, individuals, and, the, state, and, they, can, themselves, be, responsible, for, human, rights, violations, corporations, can, be, dissolved, either, by, statutory, operation, the, order, of, the, court, or, voluntary, action, on, the, part, of, shareholders, insolvency, may, result, in, a, form, of, corporate, failure, when, creditors, force, the, liquidation, and, dissolution, of, the, corporation, under, court, order, but, it, most, often, results, in, a, restructuring, of, corporate, holdings, corporations, can, even, be, convicted, of, special, criminal, offenses, in, the, uk, such, as, fraud, and, corporate, manslaughter, however, corporations, are, not, considered, living, entities, in, the, way, that, humans, are, legal, scholars, and, others, such, as, joel, bakan, have, observed, that, a, business, corporation, created, as, a, legal, person, has, a, psychopathic, personality, because, it, is, required, to, elevate, its, own, interests, above, those, of,
