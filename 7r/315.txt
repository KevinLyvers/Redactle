literacy, is, the, ability, to, read, and, write, some, researchers, suggest, that, the, study, of, literacy, as, a, concept, can, be, divided, into, two, periods, the, period, before, 1950, when, literacy, was, understood, solely, as, alphabetical, literacy, word, and, letter, recognition, and, the, period, after, 1950, when, literacy, slowly, began, to, be, considered, as, a, wider, concept, and, process, including, the, social, and, cultural, aspects, of, reading, and, writing, and, functional, literacy, the, range, of, definitions, of, literacy, used, by, ngos, think, tanks, and, advocacy, groups, since, the, 1990s, suggests, that, this, shift, in, understanding, from, discrete, skill, to, social, practice, is, both, ongoing, and, uneven, some, definitions, remain, fairly, closely, aligned, with, the, traditional, ability, to, read, and, write, connotation, whereas, others, take, a, broader, view, the, concept, of, multiliteracies, has, gained, currency, particularly, in, english, language, arts, curricula, on, the, grounds, that, reading, is, interactive, and, informative, and, occurs, in, ever, increasingly, technological, settings, where, information, is, part, of, spatial, audio, and, visual, patterns, rhodes, robnolt, 2009, objections, have, been, raised, that, this, concept, downplays, the, importance, of, reading, instruction, that, focuses, on, alphabetic, representations, however, these, are, not, mutually, exclusive, as, children, can, become, proficient, in, word, reading, while, engaging, with, multiliteracies, word, reading, is, fundamental, for, multiple, forms, of, communication, beginning, in, the, 1940s, the, term, literacy, has, often, been, used, to, mean, having, knowledge, or, skill, in, a, particular, field, such, as, functional, illiteracy, relates, to, adults, and, has, been, defined, in, different, ways, functional, illiteracy, is, distinguished, from, primary, illiteracy, i, e, the, inability, to, read, and, write, a, short, simple, statement, concerning, one, s, own, everyday, life, and, learning, difficulties, e, g, dyslexia, these, categories, have, been, contested, as, has, the, concept, of, illiteracy, itself, for, being, predicated, on, narrow, assumptions, primarily, derived, from, school, based, contexts, about, what, counts, as, reading, and, writing, e, g, comprehending, and, following, instructions, script, is, thought, to, have, developed, independently, at, least, five, times, in, human, history, in, mesopotamia, egypt, the, indus, civilization, lowland, mesoamerica, and, china, between, 3500, bce, and, 3000, bce, in, southern, mesopotamia, the, ancient, sumerians, invented, writing, during, this, era, literacy, was, a, largely, functional, matter, propelled, by, the, need, to, manage, the, new, quantities, of, information, and, the, new, type, of, governance, created, by, trade, and, large, scale, production, early, writing, systems, first, emerged, as, a, recording, system, in, which, people, used, tokens, with, impressed, markings, to, manage, trade, and, agricultural, production, the, token, system, served, as, a, precursor, to, early, cuneiform, writing, once, people, began, recording, information, on, clay, tablets, proto, cuneiform, texts, exhibit, not, only, numerical, signs, but, also, ideograms, depicting, objects, being, counted, though, the, traditional, view, had, been, that, cuneiform, literacy, was, restricted, to, a, class, of, scribes, assyriologists, including, claus, wilcke, and, dominique, charpin, have, argued, that, functional, literacy, was, somewhat, widespread, by, the, old, babylonian, period, nonetheless, professional, scribes, became, central, to, law, finances, accounting, government, administration, medicine, magic, divination, literature, and, prayers, egyptian, hieroglyphs, emerged, between, 3300, bce, and, 3100, bce, the, iconography, emphasized, power, among, royals, and, other, elites, the, egyptian, hieroglyphic, writing, system, was, the, first, notation, system, to, have, phonetic, values, these, symbols, are, called, phonograms, writing, in, lowland, mesoamerica, was, first, used, by, the, olmec, and, zapotec, civilizations, in, 900, 400, bce, these, civilizations, used, glyphic, writing, and, bar, and, dot, numerical, notation, systems, for, purposes, related, to, royal, iconography, and, calendar, systems, the, earliest, written, notations, in, china, date, back, to, the, shang, dynasty, in, 1200, bce, these, systematic, notations, inscribed, on, bones, recorded, sacrifices, made, tributes, received, and, animals, hunted, which, were, activities, of, the, elite, these, oracle, bone, inscriptions, were, the, early, ancestors, of, modern, chinese, script, and, contained, logosyllabic, script, and, numerals, by, the, time, of, the, consolidation, of, the, chinese, empire, during, the, qin, and, han, dynasties, c, 200, bce, written, documents, were, central, to, the, formation, and, policing, of, a, hierarchical, bureaucratic, governance, structure, reinforced, through, law, within, this, legal, order, written, records, kept, track, of, and, controlled, citizen, movements, created, records, of, misdeeds, and, documented, the, actions, and, judgments, of, government, officials, indus, script, is, largely, pictorial, and, has, not, yet, been, deciphered, as, such, it, is, unknown, whether, it, includes, abstract, signs, it, is, thought, that, they, wrote, from, right, to, left, and, that, the, script, is, logographic, because, it, has, not, been, deciphered, linguists, disagree, on, whether, it, is, a, complete, and, independent, writing, system, however, it, is, generally, thought, to, be, an, independent, writing, system, that, emerged, in, the, harappa, culture, existing, evidence, suggests, that, most, early, acts, of, literacy, were, in, some, areas, such, as, egypt, closely, tied, to, power, and, chiefly, used, for, management, practices, and, probably, less, than, 1, of, the, population, was, literate, as, it, was, confined, to, a, very, small, group, scholarship, by, others, such, as, dominique, charpin, and, a, project, from, the, european, union, however, suggest, that, this, was, not, the, case, in, all, ancient, societies, both, charpin, and, the, eu, s, emerging, scholarship, suggest, that, writing, and, literacy, were, far, more, widespread, in, mesopotamia, than, scholars, previously, thought, according, to, social, anthropologist, jack, goody, there, are, two, interpretations, regarding, the, origin, of, the, alphabet, many, classical, scholars, such, as, historian, ignace, gelb, credit, the, ancient, greeks, for, creating, the, first, alphabetic, system, c, 750, bce, that, used, distinctive, signs, for, consonants, and, vowels, goody, contests, the, importance, of, greek, culture, of, the, subsequent, history, of, western, europe, has, led, to, an, over, emphasis, by, classicists, and, others, on, the, addition, of, specific, vowel, signs, to, the, set, of, consonantal, ones, that, had, been, developed, earlier, in, western, asia, many, scholars, argue, that, the, ancient, semitic, speaking, peoples, of, northern, canaan, invented, the, consonantal, alphabet, as, early, as, 1500, bce, much, of, this, theory, s, development, is, credited, to, english, archeologist, flinders, petrie, who, in, 1905, came, across, a, series, of, canaanite, inscriptions, in, the, turquoise, mines, of, serabit, el, khadem, ten, years, later, english, egyptologist, alan, gardiner, reasoned, that, these, letters, contain, an, alphabet, as, well, as, references, to, the, canaanite, goddess, asherah, in, 1948, william, f, albright, deciphered, the, text, using, new, evidence, including, a, series, of, inscriptions, from, ugarit, discovered, in, 1929, by, french, archaeologist, claude, f, a, schaeffer, some, of, these, inscriptions, were, mythological, texts, written, in, an, early, canaanite, dialect, that, consisted, of, a, 30, letter, cuneiform, consonantal, alphabet, another, significant, discovery, was, made, in, 1953, when, three, arrowheads, were, uncovered, each, containing, identical, canaanite, inscriptions, from, 12th, century, bce, according, to, frank, moore, cross, these, inscriptions, consisted, of, alphabetic, signs, that, originated, during, the, transitional, development, from, pictographic, script, to, a, linear, alphabet, moreover, he, asserts, these, inscriptions, also, provided, clues, to, extend, the, decipherment, of, earlier, and, later, alphabetic, texts, the, canaanite, script, s, consonantal, system, inspired, alphabetical, developments, in, later, systems, during, the, late, bronze, age, successor, alphabets, appeared, throughout, the, mediterranean, region, and, were, used, in, phoenician, hebrew, and, aramaic, according, to, goody, these, cuneiform, scripts, may, have, influenced, the, development, of, the, greek, alphabet, several, centuries, later, historically, the, greeks, contended, that, their, writing, system, was, modeled, after, the, phoenicians, however, many, semitic, scholars, now, believe, that, ancient, greek, is, more, consistent, with, an, early, form, of, canaanite, that, was, used, c, 1100, bce, while, the, earliest, greek, inscriptions, are, dated, circa, 8th, century, bce, epigraphical, comparisons, to, proto, canaanite, suggest, that, the, greeks, may, have, adopted, the, consonantal, alphabet, as, early, as, 1100, bce, and, later, added, in, five, characters, to, represent, vowels, phoenician, which, is, considered, to, contain, the, first, linear, alphabet, rapidly, spread, to, mediterranean, port, cities, in, northern, canaan, some, archeologists, believe, that, phoenician, influenced, the, hebrew, and, aramaic, alphabets, as, these, languages, evolved, during, the, same, time, period, share, similar, features, and, are, commonly, categorized, into, the, same, language, group, when, the, israelites, migrated, to, canaan, between, 1200, and, 1000, bce, they, adopted, a, variation, of, the, canaanite, alphabet, baruch, ben, neriah, jeremiah, s, scribe, used, this, alphabet, to, create, the, later, scripts, of, the, old, testament, the, early, hebrew, alphabet, was, prominent, in, the, mediterranean, region, until, neo, babylonian, rulers, exiled, the, jews, to, babylon, in, the, 6th, century, bce, it, was, then, that, the, new, script, square, hebrew, emerged, and, the, older, one, rapidly, died, out, the, aramaic, alphabet, also, emerged, sometime, between, 1200, and, 1000, bce, although, early, examples, are, scarce, archeologists, have, uncovered, a, wide, range, of, later, aramaic, texts, written, as, early, as, the, seventh, century, bce, in, the, near, east, it, was, common, to, record, events, on, clay, using, the, cuneiform, script, however, writing, aramaic, on, leather, parchments, became, common, during, the, neo, assyrian, empire, with, the, rise, of, the, persians, in, the, 5th, century, bce, achaemenid, rulers, adopted, aramaic, as, the, diplomatic, language, darius, the, great, standardized, aramaic, which, became, the, imperial, aramaic, script, this, imperial, aramaic, alphabet, rapidly, spread, west, to, the, kingdom, of, nabataea, then, to, the, sinai, and, arabian, peninsulas, eventually, making, its, way, to, africa, and, east, where, it, later, influenced, the, development, of, the, brahmi, script, in, india, over, the, next, few, centuries, imperial, aramaic, script, in, persia, evolved, into, pahlavi, as, well, as, for, a, range, of, alphabets, used, by, early, turkish, and, mongol, tribes, in, siberia, mongolia, and, turkestan, during, this, period, literacy, spread, among, the, merchant, classes, and, 15, 20, of, the, total, population, may, have, been, literate, the, aramaic, language, declined, with, the, spread, of, islam, which, was, accompanied, by, the, spread, of, arabic, until, recently, it, was, thought, that, the, majority, of, people, were, illiterate, in, the, classical, world, though, recent, work, challenges, this, perception, anthony, direnzo, asserts, that, roman, society, was, a, civilization, based, on, the, book, and, the, register, and, that, no, one, either, free, or, slave, could, afford, to, be, illiterate, similarly, dupont, points, out, the, written, word, was, all, around, them, in, both, public, and, private, life, laws, calendars, regulations, at, shrines, and, funeral, epitaphs, were, engraved, in, stone, or, bronze, the, republic, amassed, huge, archives, of, reports, on, every, aspect, of, public, life, the, imperial, civilian, administration, produced, masses, of, documentation, used, in, judicial, fiscal, and, administrative, matters, as, did, the, municipalities, the, army, kept, extensive, records, relating, to, supply, and, duty, rosters, and, submitted, reports, merchants, shippers, and, landowners, and, their, personal, staffs, especially, of, the, larger, enterprises, must, have, been, literate, in, the, late, fourth, century, the, desert, father, pachomius, would, expect, the, literacy, of, a, candidate, for, admission, to, his, monasteries, they, shall, give, him, twenty, psalms, or, two, of, the, apostles, epistles, or, some, other, part, of, scripture, and, if, he, is, illiterate, he, shall, go, at, the, first, third, and, sixth, hours, to, someone, who, can, teach, and, has, been, appointed, for, him, he, shall, stand, before, him, and, learn, very, studiously, and, with, all, gratitude, the, fundamentals, of, a, syllable, the, verbs, and, nouns, shall, all, be, written, for, him, and, even, if, he, does, not, want, to, he, shall, be, compelled, to, read, during, the, 4th, and, 5th, centuries, the, church, made, efforts, to, ensure, a, better, clergy, especially, the, bishops, who, were, expected, to, have, a, classical, education, the, hallmark, of, a, socially, acceptable, person, in, higher, society, even, after, the, remnants, of, the, western, roman, empire, fell, in, the, 470s, literacy, continued, to, be, a, distinguishing, mark, of, the, elite, as, communication, skills, were, still, important, in, political, and, church, life, bishops, were, largely, drawn, from, the, senatorial, class, in, a, new, cultural, synthesis, that, made, christianity, the, roman, religion, however, these, skills, were, less, needed, in, the, absence, of, a, large, imperial, administrative, apparatus, whose, middle, and, top, echelons, were, dominated, by, the, elite, even, so, in, pre, modern, times, it, is, unlikely, that, literacy, was, found, in, more, than, about, 30, 40, of, the, population, during, the, dark, ages, the, highest, percentage, of, literacy, was, found, among, the, clergy, and, monks, as, they, made, up, much, of, the, staff, needed, to, administer, the, states, of, western, europe, an, abundance, of, graffiti, written, in, the, nabataean, script, dating, back, to, the, beginning, of, the, first, millennium, ce, has, been, taken, to, imply, a, relatively, high, degree, of, literacy, among, the, general, population, in, the, ancient, arabic, speaking, world, post, antiquity, illiteracy, was, made, worse, by, the, lack, of, a, suitable, writing, medium, as, when, the, western, roman, empire, collapsed, the, import, of, papyrus, to, europe, ceased, since, papyrus, perishes, easily, and, does, not, last, well, in, the, wetter, european, climate, parchment, was, used, which, was, expensive, and, accessible, only, by, the, church, and, the, wealthy, paper, was, introduced, into, europe, via, spain, in, the, 11th, century, and, spread, north, slowly, over, the, next, four, centuries, literacy, saw, a, resurgence, as, a, result, and, by, the, 15th, century, paper, was, widespread, the, reformation, stressed, the, importance, of, literacy, and, being, able, to, read, the, bible, the, protestant, countries, were, the, first, to, attain, full, literacy, in, a, more, secular, context, inspired, by, the, enlightenment, sweden, implemented, programs, in, 1723, aimed, at, making, the, population, fully, literate, other, countries, implemented, similar, measures, at, this, time, these, included, denmark, in, 1739, poland, in, 1783, and, france, in, 1794, 5, literacy, was, well, established, in, early, 18th, century, england, when, books, geared, towards, children, became, far, more, common, near, the, end, of, the, century, as, many, as, 50, were, printed, every, year, in, major, cities, around, england, in, the, 19th, century, reading, would, become, even, more, common, in, the, united, kingdom, public, notes, broadsides, handbills, catchpennies, and, printed, songs, would, have, been, usual, street, literature, before, newspapers, became, common, other, forms, of, popular, reading, material, included, advertising, for, events, theaters, and, goods, for, sale, in, his, 1836, 1837, pickwick, papers, charles, dickens, s, said, that, even, the, common, people, both, in, town, and, country, are, equally, intense, in, their, admiration, frequently, have, we, seen, the, butcher, boy, with, his, tray, on, his, shoulder, reading, with, the, greatest, avidity, the, last, pickwick, the, footman, whose, fopperies, are, so, inimitably, laid, bare, the, maidservant, the,

distribution, networks, enabled, by, improved, roads, and, rail, resulted, in, an, increased, capacity, to, supply, printed, material, social, and, educational, changes, increased, the, demand, for, reading, matter, as, rising, literacy, rates, particularly, among, the, middle, and, working, classes, created, a, new, mass, market, for, printed, material, wider, schooling, helped, increase, literacy, rates, which, in, turn, helped, lower, the, cost, of, publication, unskilled, labor, forces, were, common, in, western, europe, and, as, british, industry, improved, more, engineers, and, skilled, workers, who, could, handle, technical, instructions, and, complex, situations, were, needed, literacy, was, essential, to, be, hired, a, senior, government, official, told, parliament, in,

were, becoming, more, common, in, private, homes, replacing, candlelight, and, oil, lamps, enabling, reading, after, dark, and, increasing, the, appeal, of, literacy, data, published, by, unesco, shows, that, the, worldwide, literacy, rate, among, adults, has, increased, on, average, by, 5, percentage, points, every, decade, since, 1950, from, 55, 7, in, 1950, to, 86, 2, in, 2015, due, to, rapid, population, growth, while, the, percentage, of, adults, who, were, illiterate, decreased, the, actual, number, of, illiterate, adults, increased, from, 700, million, in, 1950, to, 878, million, in, 1990, before, starting, to, decrease, and, falling, to, 745, million, by, 2015, the, number, of, illiterate, adults, remains, higher, than, in, 1950, despite, decades, of, universal, education, policies, literacy, interventions, and, the, spread, of, print, material, and, information, and, communications, technology, ict, available, global, data, indicates, significant, variations, in, literacy, rates, between, world, regions, north, america, europe, west, asia, and, central, asia, have, almost, achieved, full, literacy, for, men, and, women, aged, 15, or, older, most, countries, in, east, asia, and, the, pacific, as, well, as, latin, america, and, the, caribbean, have, adult, literacy, rates, over, 90, in, other, regions, illiteracy, persists, at, higher, rates, as, of, 2013, the, adult, literacy, rate, in, south, asia, and, north, africa, was, 67, 55, and, 59, 76, in, sub, saharan, africa, in, much, of, the, world, high, youth, literacy, rates, suggest, that, illiteracy, will, become, less, common, as, more, educated, younger, generations, replace, less, educated, older, ones, however, in, sub, saharan, africa, and, south, asia, where, the, vast, majority, of, the, world, s, illiterate, youth, live, lower, school, enrollment, implies, that, illiteracy, will, persist, to, a, greater, degree, according, to, 2013, data, the, youth, literacy, rate, ages, 15, to, 24, is, 84, in, south, asia, and, north, africa, and, 70, in, sub, saharan, africa, however, the, distinction, between, literacy, and, illiteracy, is, not, clear, cut, given, that, having, a, literate, person, in, the, household, confers, many, of, the, benefits, of, literacy, some, recent, literature, in, economics, starting, with, the, work, of, kaushik, basu, and, james, foster, distinguishes, between, a, proximate, illiterate, and, an, isolated, illiterate, a, proximate, illiterate, lives, in, a, household, with, literate, members, while, an, isolated, illiterate, lives, in, a, household, where, everyone, is, illiterate, isolated, illiteracy, is, more, common, among, older, populations, in, wealthier, nations, where, people, are, less, likely, to, live, in, multigenerational, households, with, potentially, literate, relatives, a, 2018, 2019, unesco, report, noted, that, conversely, in, low, and, lower, middle, income, countries, isolated, illiteracy, is, concentrated, among, younger, people, along, with, increased, rates, among, rural, populations, and, women, this, evidence, indicates, that, illiteracy, is, a, complex, phenomenon, with, multiple, factors, impacting, rates, of, illiteracy, and, the, type, of, illiteracy, one, may, experience, literacy, has, rapidly, spread, in, several, regions, in, the, last, twenty, five, years, and, the, united, nations, s, global, initiative, with, sustainable, development, goal, 4, is, also, gaining, momentum, the, traditional, concept, of, literacy, widened, as, a, consensus, emerged, among, researchers, in, composition, studies, education, research, and, anthropological, linguistics, that, it, makes, little, sense, to, speak, of, reading, or, writing, outside, of, a, specific, context, with, linguist, james, paul, gee, describing, it, as, simply, incoherent, for, example, even, the, extremely, early, stages, of, acquiring, mastery, over, symbol, shapes, take, place, in, a, particular, social, context, even, if, that, context, is, school, and, after, print, acquisition, every, instance, of, reading, or, writing, will, be, for, a, specific, purpose, and, occasion, with, particular, readers, and, writers, in, mind, reading, and, writing, therefore, are, never, separable, from, social, and, cultural, elements, a, corollary, point, made, by, david, barton, and, rosalind, ivani, among, others, is, that, the, cognitive, and, societal, effects, of, acquiring, literacy, are, not, easily, predictable, since, as, brian, street, has, argued, the, ways, in, which, people, address, reading, and, writing, are, themselves, rooted, in, conceptions, of, knowledge, identity, and, being, consequently, as, jack, goody, has, documented, historically, literacy, has, included, the, transformation, of, social, systems, that, rely, on, literacy, and, the, changing, uses, of, literacy, within, those, evolving, systems, according, to, 2015, data, collected, by, the, unesco, institute, for, statistics, about, two, thirds, 63, of, the, world, s, illiterate, adults, are, women, this, disparity, was, even, starker, in, previous, decades, and, from, 1970, to, 2000, the, global, gender, gap, in, literacy, decreased, significantly, in, recent, years, however, this, progress, has, stagnated, with, the, gender, gap, holding, almost, constant, over, the, last, two, decades, in, general, the, gender, gap, in, literacy, is, not, as, pronounced, as, the, regional, gap, that, is, differences, between, countries, are, often, larger, than, gender, differences, within, countries, sub, saharan, africa, has, the, lowest, overall, literacy, rate, and, the, widest, gender, gap, 52, of, adult, women, and, 68, of, adult, men, are, literate, a, similar, gender, disparity, exists, in, north, africa, where, 70, of, adult, women, are, literate, versus, 86, of, adult, men, in, south, asia, 58, of, adult, women, and, 77, of, adult, men, are, literate, the, 1990, world, conference, on, education, for, all, held, in, jomtien, thailand, brought, attention, to, the, literacy, gender, gap, and, prompted, many, developing, countries, to, prioritize, women, s, literacy, in, many, contexts, female, illiteracy, coexists, with, other, aspects, of, gender, inequality, martha, nussbaum, says, illiterate, women, are, more, vulnerable, to, becoming, trapped, in, an, abusive, marriage, given, that, illiteracy, limits, their, employment, opportunities, and, worsens, their, position, when, negotiating, within, the, household, moreover, nussbaum, links, literacy, to, the, ability, for, women, to, effectively, communicate, and, collaborate, with, one, another, to, participate, in, a, larger, movement, for, political, change, social, barriers, can, limit, opportunities, to, increase, literacy, skills, among, women, and, girls, making, literacy, classes, available, can, be, ineffective, when, it, conflicts, with, the, use, of, the, valuable, limited, time, of, women, and, girls, school, age, girls, may, face, more, expectations, than, their, male, counterparts, to, perform, household, work, and, care, for, younger, siblings, generational, dynamics, can, also, perpetuate, these, disparities, illiterate, parents, may, not, readily, appreciate, the, value, of, literacy, for, their, daughters, particularly, in, traditional, rural, societies, with, expectations, that, girls, will, remain, at, home, a, world, bank, and, international, center, for, research, on, women, review, of, academic, literature, concluded, that, child, marriage, which, predominantly, impacts, girls, tends, to, reduce, literacy, levels, a, 2008, analysis, of, the, issue, in, bangladesh, found, that, for, every, additional, year, a, girl, s, marriage, is, delayed, her, likelihood, of, literacy, increases, by, 5, 6, similarly, a, 2014, study, found, that, in, sub, saharan, africa, marrying, early, significantly, decreases, a, girl, s, probability, of, literacy, even, after, accounting, for, other, variables, therefore, a, 2015, literature, review, recommended, marriage, postponement, as, part, of, a, strategy, to, increase, educational, attainment, levels, including, female, literacy, while, women, and, girls, comprise, the, majority, of, the, global, illiterate, population, in, many, developed, countries, a, literacy, gender, gap, exists, in, the, opposite, direction, data, from, the, programme, for, international, student, assessment, has, consistently, shown, the, literacy, underachievement, of, boys, within, member, countries, of, the, organisation, for, economic, co, operation, and, development, oecd, in, view, of, such, findings, many, education, specialists, have, recommended, changing, classroom, practices, to, better, accommodate, boys, learning, styles, and, removing, any, gender, stereotypes, that, may, create, the, perception, that, reading, and, writing, are, feminine, activities, many, policy, analysts, consider, literacy, rates, to, be, a, crucial, measure, of, the, value, of, a, region, s, human, capital, for, example, literate, people, can, be, more, easily, trained, than, illiterate, people, and, generally, have, a, higher, socioeconomic, status, thus, they, enjoy, better, health, and, employment, prospects, the, international, community, has, come, to, consider, literacy, as, a, key, facilitator, and, goal, of, development, in, regard, to, the, sustainable, development, goals, adopted, by, the, un, in, 2015, the, unesco, institute, for, lifelong, learning, has, declared, the, central, role, of, literacy, in, responding, to, sustainable, development, challenges, such, as, health, social, equality, economic, empowerment, and, environmental, sustainability, a, majority, of, prisoners, have, been, found, to, be, illiterate, and, in, edinburgh, prison, winner, of, the, 2010, libraries, change, lives, award, the, library, has, become, the, cornerstone, of, the, prison, s, literacy, strategy, reducing, recidivism, and, reoffending, and, allowing, incarcerated, people, to, work, toward, attaining, higher, socioeconomic, status, once, released, as, socioeconomics, affects, brain, development, and, brain, functions, are, heavily, involved, in, processing, both, input, and, output, a, learner, s, environment, can, affect, the, cognitive, process, of, learning, how, to, read, and, write, before, a, child, enters, a, school, setting, their, executive, function, is, influenced, by, their, home, environment, research, demonstrates, that, for, children, who, grow, up, in, poverty, their, socioeconomic, circumstances, severely, strain, their, neuro, endocrine, and, brain, function, this, affects, a, child, s, ability, to, regulate, environmental, stimuli, process, and, structure, information, and, plan, and, effectively, execute, tasks, that, involve, their, working, memory, all, of, these, are, necessary, cognitive, facilities, to, successfully, learn, how, to, read, and, write, living, in, poverty, is, stressful, for, all, involved, but, is, cognitively, damaging, for, young, children, a, study, done, by, nichd, indicates, that, socioeconomics, plays, a, role, for, children, who, are, young, when, the, family, experiences, poverty, but, shows, no, indication, of, adverse, effects, on, reading, achievement, or, behavior, for, adolescents, entering, poverty, the, data, extensively, shows, that, children, from, low, socioeconomic, backgrounds, have, poorer, literacy, performance, especially, in, reading, a, study, done, by, the, oecd, which, included, over, 25, countries, in, europe, found, that, in, all, studied, countries, students, who, lived, in, low, income, households, scored, lower, in, reading, than, students, who, lived, in, high, income, households, parenting, also, affects, a, child, s, literacy, field, research, was, done, by, collecting, data, from, families, that, were, upper, middle, or, lower, class, or, on, welfare, the, results, found, that, in, a, 100, hour, week, children, in, upper, class, households, experienced, an, average, of, over, 200, 000, words, those, in, middle, and, lower, class, households, heard, about, 125, 000, words, and, children, from, households, on, welfare, were, exposed, to, the, fewest, words, 62, 000, words, this, indicates, that, a, child, from, an, upper, class, family, would, be, exposed, to, 8, million, more, words, than, a, child, from, a, family, on, welfare, outside, of, word, exposure, which, is, essential, for, word, acquisition, the, national, center, for, educational, statistics, found, that, 41, 9, of, children, from, low, income, families, scored, substantially, lower, on, most, reading, achievements, for, grades, 4, 8, and, 12, in, 2013, according, to, a, study, performed, by, anova, multiple, socioeconomic, variables, influence, children, such, as, parental, education, level, parental, occupation, health, history, and, even, usage, of, technology, within, the, home, with, these, factors, in, mind, their, study, showed, that, young, children, are, especially, susceptible, to, environmental, factors, meaning, socioeconomics, affects, them, cognitively, and, can, have, adverse, effects, as, their, brains, continue, to, develop, however, another, study, done, by, the, national, longitudinal, survey, of, youth, nlsy, suggests, a, slightly, different, conclusion, while, the, study, agrees, that, poverty, negatively, affects, childhood, literacy, some, nuances, are, added, in, both, studies, children, who, experienced, poverty, scored, lower, in, reading, assessments, but, the, nlsy, s, study, noted, that, the, duration, of, poverty, altered, the, literacy, outcome, it, found, that, children, ages, 5, 11, who, experienced, persistent, poverty, were, more, adversely, affected, than, their, peers, who, never, experienced, poverty, the, study, acknowledged, that, other, factors, affected, these, children, s, reading, scores, particularly, maternal, influence, the, mothers, of, these, households, were, scaled, based, on, a, home, environment, score, which, measured, their, emotional, and, verbal, responsiveness, acceptance, and, involvement, with, the, child, and, organization, households, experiencing, poverty, tended, to, have, lower, scores, and, lower, scores, correlated, with, lower, reading, levels, the, study, also, showed, that, the, effects, of, poverty, on, child, literacy, differed, by, ethnicity, culture, and, gender, print, illiteracy, generally, corresponds, with, less, knowledge, about, modern, health, hygiene, and, nutritional, practices, and, a, lack, of, knowledge, can, exacerbate, a, range, of, health, issues, within, developing, countries, in, particular, literacy, rates, also, have, implications, for, child, mortality, in, these, contexts, children, of, literate, mothers, are, 50, more, likely, to, live, past, age, 5, than, children, of, illiterate, mothers, therefore, public, health, research, has, increasingly, focused, on, the, potential, for, literacy, skills, to, allow, women, to, more, successfully, access, healthcare, and, thereby, facilitate, gains, in, child, health, a, 2014, descriptive, research, survey, project, correlates, literacy, levels, with, the, socioeconomic, status, of, women, in, oyo, state, nigeria, the, study, shows, that, developing, literacy, in, the, region, will, bring, economic, empowerment, and, will, encourage, rural, women, to, practice, hygiene, which, will, in, turn, lead, to, the, reduction, of, birth, and, death, rates, literacy, can, increase, job, opportunities, and, access, to, higher, education, in, 2009, the, national, adult, literacy, agency, in, ireland, commissioned, a, cost, benefit, analysis, of, adult, literacy, training, which, concluded, that, there, were, economic, gains, for, the, individuals, the, companies, they, worked, for, and, the, exchequer, as, well, as, the, economy, and, the, country, as, a, whole, e, g, increased, gdp, korotayev, and, coauthors, found, a, rather, significant, correlation, between, the, level, of, literacy, in, the, early, 19th, century, and, successful, modernization, and, economic, breakthroughs, in, the, late, 20th, century, as, literate, people, could, be, characterized, by, a, greater, innovative, activity, level, which, provides, opportunities, for, modernization, development, and, economic, growth, while, informal, learning, within, the, home, can, play, an, important, role, in, literacy, development, gains, in, childhood, literacy, often, occur, in, primary, school, settings, continuing, the, global, expansion, of, public, education, is, thus, a, frequent, focus, of, literacy, advocates, 103, 104, these, kinds, of, broad, improvements, in, education, often, require, centralized, efforts, by, national, governments, however, local, literacy, projects, implemented, by, ngos, can, play, an, important, role, particularly, in, rural, contexts, funding, for, both, youth, and, adult, literacy, programs, often, comes, from, large, international, development, organizations, usaid, for, example, steered, donors, like, the, bill, and, melinda, gates, foundation, and, the, global, partnership, for, education, toward, the, issue, of, childhood, literacy, by, developing, the, early, grade, reading, assessment, advocacy, groups, like, the, national, institute, of, adult, continuing, education, have, frequently, called, upon, international, organizations, such, as, unesco, the, international, labour, organization, the, world, health, organization, and, the, world, bank, to, prioritize, support, for, adult, women, s, literacy, efforts, to, increase, adult, literacy, often, encompass, other, development, priorities, as, well, for, example, initiatives, in, ethiopia, morocco, and, india, have, combined, adult, literacy, programs, with, vocational, skills, trainings, in, order, to, encourage, program, enrollment, and, address, the, complex, needs, of, women, and, other, marginalized, groups, who, lack, economic, opportunities, in, 2013, the, unesco, institute, for, lifelong, learning, published, a, set, of, case, studies, on, programs, that, successfully, improved, female, literacy, rates, the, report, features, countries, from, a, variety, of, regions, and, differing, income, levels, reflecting, the, general, global, consensus, on, the, need, to, empower, women, through, the, acquisition, of, literacy, skills, 7, part, of, the, impetus, for, unesco, s, focus, on, literacy, is, a, broader, effort, to, respond, to, globalization, and, the, shift, towards, knowledge, based, societies, that, it, has, produced, while, globalization, presents, emerging, challenges, it, also, provides, new, opportunities, many, education, and, development, specialists, are, hopeful, that, new, icts, will, expand, literacy, learning, opportunities, for, children, and, adults, even, in, countries, that, have, historically, struggled, to, improve, literacy, rates, through, more, conventional, means, 112, although, most, people, acquire, literacy, during, childhood, it, continues, to, develop, throughout, life, literacy, is, not, a, skill, that, is, fixed, once, a, person, leaves, school, but, remains, malleable, across, the, entire, lifespan, among, adults, both, gains, and, losses, in, literacy, occur, in, roughly, equal, measure, sometimes, over, relatively, short, periods, of, a, few, years, even, adults, with, very, low, literacy, levels, can, acquire, literacy, over, time, whether, a, person, experiences, gains, or, losses, depends, on, a, range, of, factors, and, one, of, the, key, factors, are, the, demands, and, opportunities, to, engage, in, literary, practices, in, the, workplace, home, or, other, contexts, the, human, development, index, produced, by, the, united, nations, development, programme, undp, uses, education, as, one, of, its, three, indicators, originally, adult, literacy, represented, two, thirds, of, this, education, index, weight, in, 2010, however, the, undp, replaced, the, adult, literacy, measure, with, mean, years, of, schooling, a, 2011, undp, research, paper, frames, this, change, as, a, way, to, ensure, current, relevance, arguing, that, gains, in, global, literacy, already, achieved, between, 1970, and, 2010, mean, that, literacy, will, be, unlikely, to, be, as, informative, of, the, future, other, scholars, however, have, since, warned, against, overlooking, the, importance, of, literacy, as, an, indicator, and, goal, for, development, particularly, for, marginalized, groups, such, as, women, and, rural, populations, the, world, bank, along, with, the, unesco, institute, for, statistics, has, developed, the, learning, poverty, concept, and, an, associated, measure, that, measures, the, proportion, of, students, who, are, unable, to, read, and, understand, a, simple, story, by, age, 10, in, low, and, middle, income, countries, 53, of, children, are, learning, poor, as, are, up, to, 80, of, children, in, poor, countries, in, fact, these, new, measures, indicate, that, these, high, rates, of, illiteracy, are, an, early, warning, sign, that, sdg, 4, for, education, and, all, related, global, goals, are, in, jeopardy, current, progress, in, improving, literacy, rates, is, seen, as, much, too, slow, to, meet, the, sdg, goals, as, at, the, current, rate, approximately, 43, of, children, will, still, be, learning, poorly, by, 2030, the, programme, for, international, student, assessment, pisa, assesses, children, on, reading, and, math, skills, at, age, 15, pisa, d, encourages, and, facilitates, pisa, testing, in, low, and, middle, income, countries, in, 2019, pisa, d, results, reveal, exceptionally, low, scores, for, participating, countries, only, 23, percent, of, students, tested, achieved, the, minimum, level, of, proficiency, in, reading, compared, with, 80, percent, of, oecd, minimum, proficiency, requires, students, to, read, simple, and, familiar, texts, and, understand, them, literally, as, well, as, demonstrating, some, ability, to, connect, pieces, of, information, and, draw, inferences, in, 2020, the, unesco, institute, for, statistics, estimated, the, global, literacy, rate, at, 86, 68, it, is, important, to, understand, how, literacy, rates, have, been, measured, in, the, past, as, well, as, how, they, are, currently, being, measured, starting, in, 1975, the, head, of, a, household, answered, a, simple, yes, or, no, question, asking, whether, household, members, could, read, and, write, in, 1988, some, countries, started, using, self, reporting, as, well, self, reported, data, is, subjective, and, has, several, limitations, first, a, simple, yes, or, no, question, does, not, capture, the, continuum, of, literacy, second, self, reports, are, dependent, on, what, each, individual, interprets, reading, and, writing, to, mean, in, some, cultures, drawing, a, picture, may, be, understood, as, writing, one, s, name, lastly, many, of, the, surveys, asked, one, individual, to, report, literacy, on, behalf, of, others, which, introduces, further, noise, in, particular, when, it, comes, to, estimating, literacy, among, women, and, children, since, these, groups, are, less, often, considered, head, of, household, in, 2007, several, countries, began, introducing, literacy, tests, as, a, more, accurate, measurement, of, literacy, rates, including, liberia, south, korea, guyana, kenya, and, bangladesh, however, in, 2016, the, majority, of, counties, still, reported, literacy, through, either, self, reported, measures, or, other, indirect, estimates, these, indirect, measurements, are, potentially, problematic, as, many, countries, measure, literacy, based, on, years, of, schooling, in, greece, an, individual, is, considered, literate, if, they, have, finished, six, years, of, primary, education, while, in, paraguay, individuals, are, considered, literate, if, they, have, completed, just, two, years, of, primary, school, however, emerging, research, reveals, that, educational, attainment, e, g, years, of, schooling, does, not, perfectly, correlate, with, literacy, literacy, tests, show, that, in, many, low, income, countries, a, large, proportion, of, students, who, have, attended, two, years, of, primary, school, cannot, read, a, single, word, these, rates, are, as, high, as, 90, of, second, grade, students, in, malawi, 85, 4, in, rural, india, 83, in, ghana, and, 64, in, uganda, in, india, over, 50, of, grade, 5, students, have, not, mastered, grade, 2, literacy, in, nigeria, only, about, 1, in, 10, women, who, completed, grade, 6, can, read, a, single, sentence, in, their, native, language, this, data, reveals, that, literacy, rates, measured, by, using, years, of, schooling, as, a, proxy, are, potentially, unreliable, and, do, not, reflect, the, true, literacy, rates, of, populations, unlike, medieval, times, when, reading, and, writing, skills, were, restricted, to, a, few, elites, and, the, clergy, literacy, skills, are, now, expected, from, every, member, of, society, literacy, is, therefore, considered, a, human, right, essential, for, lifelong, learning, and, social, change, as, supported, by, the, 1996, report, of, the, international, commission, on, education, for, the, twenty, first, century, and, the, 1997, hamburg, declaration, literacy, broadly, conceived, as, the, basic, knowledge, and, skills, needed, by, all, in, a, rapidly, changing, world, is, a, fundamental, human, right, there, are, millions, the, majority, of, whom, are, women, who, lack, opportunities, to, learn, or, who, have, insufficient, skills, to, be, able, to, assert, this, right, the, challenge, is, to, enable, them, to, do, so, this, will, often, imply, the, creation, of, preconditions, for, learning, through, awareness, raising, and, empowerment, literacy, is, also, a, catalyst, for, participation, in, social, cultural, political, and, economic, activities, and, for, learning, throughout, life, in, 2016, the, european, literacy, policy, network, an, association, of, european, literacy, professionals, published, a, document, entitled, the, european, declaration, of, the, right, to, literacy, it, states, that, everyone, in, europe, has, the, right, to, acquire, literacy, eu, member, states, should, ensure, that, people, of, all, ages, regardless, of, social, class, religion, ethnicity, origin, and, gender, are, provided, with, the, necessary, resources, and, opportunities, to, develop, sufficient, and, sustainable, literacy, skills, in, order, to, effectively, understand, and, use, written, communication, be, in, handwritten, in, print, or, digital, form, in, school, reading, and, writing, are, often, taught, as, separate, skills, however, children, show, curiosity, about, the, written, word, and, begin, to, experiment, with, both, in, a, process, of, emergent, literacy, and, making, sense, of, and, using, the, writing, system, they, see, used, around, them, every, new, piece, of, writing, draws, on, previous, reading, through, a, process, of, intertextuality, sometimes, explicitly, through, citation, as, in, academic, writing, and, writing, about, reading, is, one, of, the, major, approaches, for, teaching, writing, in, higher, education, intertextuality, however, can, also, be, implicit, through, well, known, recognizable, phrases, from, specific, works, or, genres, or, through, the, development, of, a, distinct, writing, style, evidence, has, supported, the, integration, of, reading, and, writing, at, all, levels, of, schooling, as, improvement, in, one, area, supports, the, other, a, series, of, metastudies, have, examined, the, effectiveness, of, various, methods, of, teaching, writing, revealing, that, attention, to, context, cognitive, motivational, factors, and, the, instruction, strategy, among, other, things, are, important, critiques, of, autonomous, models, of, literacy, notwithstanding, the, belief, that, reading, development, is, key, to, literacy, remains, dominant, at, least, in, the, united, states, where, it, is, understood, as, the, progression, of, skills, that, begins, with, the, ability, to, understand, spoken, words, and, decode, written, words, and, culminates, in, the, deep, understanding, of, the, text, reading, development, involves, a, range, of, complex, language, underpinnings, including, awareness, of, speech, sounds, phonology, spelling, patterns, orthography, word, meaning, semantics, syntax, and, patterns, of, word, formation, morphology, all, of, which, provide, a, necessary, platform, for, reading, fluency, and, comprehension, once, these, skills, are, acquired, it, is, believed, a, reader, can, attain, full, language, literacy, which, includes, the, abilities, to, apply, to, printed, material, critical, analysis, inference, and, synthesis, to, write, with, accuracy, and, coherence, and, to, use, information, and, insights, from, text, as, the, basis, for, informed, decisions, and, creative, thought, for, this, reason, teaching, english, reading, literacy, in, the, united, states, is, dominated, by, a, focus, on, a, set, of, discrete, decoding, skills, from, this, perspective, literacy, or, rather, reading, comprises, a, number, of, sub, skills, that, can, be, taught, to, students, these, sub, skills, include, phonological, awareness, phonics, decoding, fluency, comprehension, and, vocabulary, mastering, each, of, these, sub, skills, is, necessary, for, students, to, become, proficient, readers, from, this, same, perspective, readers, of, alphabetic, languages, must, understand, the, alphabetic, principle, to, master, basic, reading, skills, for, this, purpose, a, writing, system, is, alphabetic, if, it, uses, symbols, to, represent, phonemes, individual, language, sounds, though, the, degree, of, correspondence, between, letters, and, sounds, varies, between, alphabetic, languages, syllabic, writing, systems, such, as, japanese, kana, use, a, symbol, to, represent, a, single, syllable, and, logographic, writing, systems, such, as, chinese, use, a, symbol, to, represent, a, morpheme, there, are, a, number, of, approaches, to, teaching, reading, each, is, shaped, by, its, assumptions, about, what, literacy, is, and, how, it, is, best, learned, by, students, phonics, instruction, for, example, focuses, on, reading, at, the, level, of, letters, or, symbols, and, their, sounds, i, e, sublexical, it, teaches, readers, to, decode, the, letters, or, groups, of, letters, that, make, up, a, word, a, common, method, of, teaching, phonics, is, synthetic, phonics, in, which, a, novice, reader, pronounces, each, individual, sound, and, blends, them, to, pronounce, the, whole, word, another, approach, is, embedded, phonics, instruction, used, more, often, in, whole, language, reading, instruction, in, which, novice, readers, learn, about, the, individual, letters, in, words, on, a, just, in, time, just, in, place, basis, that, is, tailored, to, meet, each, student, s, reading, and, writing, learning, needs, that, is, teachers, provide, phonics, instruction, opportunistically, within, the, context, of, stories, or, student, writing, that, feature, repeat, instances, of, a, particular, letter, or, group, of, letters, embedded, instruction, combines, letter, sound, knowledge, with, the, use, of, meaningful, context, to, read, new, and, difficult, words, techniques, such, as, directed, listening, and, thinking, activities, can, be, used, to, aid, children, in, learning, how, to, read, and, in, reading, comprehension, for, students, at, both, primary, and, secondary, levels, writing, about, what, they, read, as, they, are, learning, to, write, has, been, found, to, also, be, effective, in, improving, their, reading, skills, the, two, most, commonly, used, approaches, to, reading, instruction, are, structured, literacy, instruction, and, balanced, literacy, instruction, the, structured, literacy, approach, explicitly, and, systematically, focuses, on, phonological, awareness, word, recognition, phonics, decoding, spelling, and, syntax, at, both, the, sentence, and, paragraph, levels, the, balanced, literacy, approach, as, the, name, suggests, balances, emphasis, on, phonics, and, decoding, shared, guided, and, independent, reading, and, grapheme, representations, with, context, and, imagery, both, approaches, have, their, critics, those, who, oppose, structured, literacy, claim, that, by, restricting, students, to, phonemes, their, fluency, development, is, limited, critics, of, balanced, literacy, claim, that, if, phonics, and, decoding, instruction, are, neglected, students, will, have, to, rely, on, compensatory, strategies, when, confronted, with, unfamiliar, text, these, strategies, are, taught, to, students, as, part, of, the, balanced, literacy, approach, based, on, a, theory, about, reading, development, called, the, three, cueing, system, as, the, name, suggests, the, three, cueing, system, uses, three, cues, to, determine, the, meaning, of, words, grapho, phonetic, cues, letter, sound, relationships, syntactic, cues, grammatical, structure, and, semantic, cues, a, word, making, sense, in, context, however, cognitive, neuroscientist, mark, seidenberg, and, professor, timothy, shanahan, do, not, support, the, theory, they, say, the, three, cueing, system, s, value, in, reading, instruction, is, a, magnificent, work, of, the, imagination, and, it, developed, not, because, teachers, lack, integrity, commitment, motivation, sincerity, or, intelligence, but, because, they, were, poorly, trained, and, advised, about, the, science, of, reading, in, england, the, simple, view, of, reading, and, synthetic, phonics, are, intended, to, replace, the, searchlights, multi, cueing, model, in, his, 2009, book, reading, in, the, brain, cognitive, neuroscientist, stanislas, dehaene, said, cognitive, psychology, directly, refutes, any, notion, of, teaching, via, a, global, or, whole, language, method, he, goes, on, to, talk, about, the, myth, of, whole, word, reading, saying, it, has, been, refuted, by, recent, experiments, we, do, not, recognize, a, printed, word, through, a, holistic, grasping, of, its, contours, because, our, brain, breaks, it, down, into, letters, and, graphemes, however, a, 2012, hypothesis, proposed, that, reading, might, be, acquired, naturally, in, the, same, manner, as, spoken, language, if, print, is, constantly, available, at, an, early, age, according, to, this, theory, if, an, appropriate, form, of, written, text, is, made, available, before, formal, schooling, begins, reading, should, be, learned, inductively, emerge, naturally, and, have, no, significant, negative, consequences, this, proposal, challenges, the, commonly, held, belief, that, written, language, requires, formal, instruction, and, schooling, thus, its, success, would, change, current, views, of, literacy, and, schooling, using, developments, in, behavioral, science, and, technology, technology, assisted, reading, acquisition, tara, an, interactive, system, would, enable, young, pre, literate, children, to, accurately, perceive, and, learn, the, properties, of, written, language, through, simple, exposure, to, the, written, form, in, australia, a, number, of, state, governments, have, introduced, reading, challenges, to, improve, literacy, the, premier, s, reading, challenge, in, south, australia, launched, by, premier, mike, rann, has, one, of, the, highest, participation, rates, in, the, world, for, reading, challenges, it, has, been, embraced, by, more, than, 95, of, public, private, and, religious, schools, programs, have, been, implemented, in, regions, that, have, an, ongoing, conflict, or, are, in, a, post, conflict, stage,

and, apprenticeships, although, there, is, considerable, awareness, that, language, deficiencies, including, a, lack, of, proficiency, are, disadvantageous, to, immigrants, settling, into, a, new,

it, to, the, ls, reader, s, needs, recent, developments, to, address, the, gap, in, teaching, literacy, to, foreign, language, learners, have, been, ongoing, with, promising, results, seen, with, a, curricular, framework, from, the, harvard, graduate, school, of, education, which, integrates, teaching, for, understanding, a, series, of, pilot, projects, have, been, carried, out, in, the, middle, east, and, africa, and, significant, interest, from, the, learners, has, been, seen, in, the, use, of, visual, arts, as, springboards, for, literacy, oriented, instruction, in, one, project, migrant, women, were, provided, with, cameras, and, took, the, instructor, on, a, walking, tour, of, their, village, there, they, photographed, places, and, activities, that, would, later, be, used, for,

in, efforts, to, develop, alternative, approaches, for, literacy, instruction, utilizing, visual, arts, work, was, carried, out, with, afghan, laborers, bangladeshi, tailors, emirati, media, students, internal, ethiopian, migrants, both, laborers, and, university, students, and, a, street, child, it, should, be, pointed, out, that, in, these, challenging, contexts, sometimes, the, teaching, of, literacy, may, have, unforeseen, barriers, the, el, gazette, reported, that, in, the, trials, carried, out, in, ethiopia, for, example, it, was, found, that, all, ten, of, the, participants, had, problems, with, vision, in, order, to, overcome, this, or, avoid, such, challenges, preliminary, health, checks, can, help, inform, pre, teaching, in, order, to, better, assist, in, the, teaching, and, learning, of, literacy, using, a, visual, arts, approach, to, literacy, instruction, can, provide, benefits, by, incorporating, a, traditional, literacy, approach, reading, and, writing, while, also, addressing, 21st, century, digital, literacy, through, the, use, of, digital, cameras, and, posting, images, onto, the, web, many, scholars, such, as, hutchison, and, woodward, feel, that, it, is, necessary, to, include, digital, literacy, under, the, traditional, umbrella, of, literacy, instruction, specifically, when, engaging, second, language, learners, a, visual, arts, approach, to, literary, instruction, for, migrant, populations, can, also, be, blended, with, core, curricular, goals, a, pressing, challenge, in, education, is, the, instruction, of, literacy, to, migrant, english, language, learners, mells, a, term, coined, by, pellerine, and, not, limited, to, english, due, to, the, growing, share, of, immigrants, in, many, western, societies, there, has, been, increasing, concern, for, the, degree, to, which, immigrants, acquire, language, that, is, spoken, in, the, destination, country, while, learning, literacy, in, one, s, first, language, can, be, challenging, the, challenge, becomes, even, more, cognitively, demanding, when, learning, a, second, language, the, task, can, become, considerably, more, difficult, when, confronted, by, a, migrant, who, has, made, a, sudden, change, by, immigrating, and, requires, the, second, language, immediately, upon, arrival, in, most, instances, a, migrant, will, not, have, the, opportunity, to, start, school, again, in, grade, one, and, acquire, the, language, naturally, instead, alternative, interventions, need, to, take, place, in, these, cases, a, visual, arts, approach, can, be, helpful, taking, a, photo, sketching, an, event, or, painting, an, image, have, been, seen, as, effective, ways, to, understand, the, intention, of, the, learner, as, they, can, incorporate, orality, in, the, above, image, from, left, to, right, in, a, study, based, in, ethiopia, participants, were, asked, to, rate, their, preference, for, activity, on, a, scale, of, 1, 10, the, survey, prompt, was, on, a, scale, of, 1, to, 10, how, would, you, rate, photography, as, an, activity, that, helped, you, get, inspiration, for, your, writing, activities, think, of, enjoyment, and, usefulness, the, activities, used, as, primers, for, writing, were, rated, in, order, of, preference, more, research, would, need, to, be, conducted, to, confirm, such, trends, authorship, programs, have, been, successful, in, bringing, student, work, together, in, book, format, as, part, of, the, program, s, culmination, these, books, can, be, used, to, document, learning, and, more, importantly, to, reinforce, language, and, content, goals, the, collection, of, such, writings, into, books, can, trigger, both, intrinsic, and, extrinsic, motivation, feedback, by, students, involved, in, such, initiatives, indicates, that, the, healthy, pressures, of, collective, and, collaborative, work, were, beneficial, on, average, girls, do, better, than, boys, at, english, yet, nearly, one, in, ten, young, adult, women, have, poor, reading, and, writing, skills, in, the, uk, in, the, 21st, century, which, seriously, damages, their, employment, prospects, many, are, trapped, in, poverty, but, hide, their, lack, of, reading, skills, due, to, social, stigma, literacy, is, first, documented, to, have, occurred, in, the, area, of, modern, england, on, 24, september, 54, bce, when, julius, caesar, and, quintus, cicero, wrote, to, marcus, cicero, from, the, nearest, shores, of, britain, literacy, was, widespread, under, roman, rule, but, became, very, rare, limited, almost, entirely, to, churchmen, after, the, fall, of, the, western, roman, empire, in, 12th, and, 13th, century, england, the, ability, to, recite, a, particular, passage, from, the, bible, psalm, 51, in, latin, entitled, a, common, law, defendant, to, the, benefit, of, clergy, and, trial, before, an, ecclesiastical, court, where, sentences, were, more, lenient, instead, of, a, secular, one, where, hanging, was, a, likely, sentence, thus, literate, defendants, often, claimed, the, benefit, of, clergy, while, an, illiterate, person, who, had, memorized, the, psalm, used, in, the, literacy, test, could, also, claim, the, benefit, of, clergy, despite, lacking, a, system, of, free, and, compulsory, primary, schooling, england, reached, near, universal, literacy, in, the, 19th, century, as, a, result, of, shared, informal, learning, provided, by, family, members, fellow, workers, or, benevolent, employers, even, with, near, universal, literacy, the, gap, between, male, and, female, rates, persisted, until, the, early, 20th, century, many, women, in, the, west, during, the, 19th, century, were, able, to, read, but, unable, to, write, formal, higher, education, in, the, arts, and, sciences, in, wales, from, the, middle, ages, to, the, 18th, century, was, limited, to, the, wealthy, and, the, clergy, following, the, roman, occupation, and, the, conquest, by, the, english, education, in, wales, was, at, a, low, point, during, the, early, modern, period, in, particular, formal, education, was, only, available, in, english, while, the, majority, of, the, population, spoke, only, welsh, the, first, modern, grammar, schools, were, established, in, welsh, towns, such, as, ruthin, brecon, and, cowbridge, one, of, the, first, modern, national, education, methods, to, use, the, native, welsh, language, was, started, by, griffith, jones, in, 1731, jones, became, rector, of, llanddowror, in, 1716, and, remained, there, for, the, rest, of, his, life, he, organized, and, introduced, a, welsh, language, circulating, school, system, which, was, attractive, and, effective, for, welsh, speakers, while, also, teaching, them, english, which, gave, them, access, to, broader, educational, sources, the, circulating, schools, may, have, taught, half, the, country, s, population, to, read, literacy, rates, in, wales, by, the, mid, 18th, century, were, one, of, the, highest, the, ability, to, read, did, not, necessarily, mean, the, ability, to, write, the, 1686, church, law, kyrkolagen, of, the, kingdom, of, sweden, modern, sweden, finland, latvia, and, estonia, made, literacy, compulsory, and, by, 1800, the, percent, of, people, able, to, read, was, close, to, 100, this, was, directly, dependent, on, the, need, to, read, religious, texts, in, the, lutheran, faith, in, sweden, and, finland, as, a, result, literacy, in, these, countries, was, specifically, focused, on, reading, however, as, late, as, the, 19th, century, many, swedes, especially, women, could, not, write, iceland, was, an, exception, as, it, achieved, widespread, literacy, without, formal, schooling, libraries, or, printed, books, via, informal, tuition, by, religious, leaders, and, peasant, teachers, historian, ernest, gellner, argues, that, continental, european, countries, were, far, more, successful, in, implementing, educational, reform, because, their, governments, were, more, willing, to, invest, in, the, population, as, a, whole, government, oversight, allowed, countries, to, standardize, curriculum, and, secure, funding, through, legislation, thus, enabling, educational, programs, to, have, a, broader, reach, although, present, day, concepts, of, literacy, have, much, to, do, with, the, 15th, century, invention, of, the, movable, type, printing, press, it, was, not, until, the, industrial, revolution, of, the, mid, 19th, century, that, paper, and, books, became, affordable, to, all, classes, of, industrialized, society, until, then, only, a, small, percent, of, the, population, was, literate, as, only, wealthy, individuals, and, institutions, could, afford, the, materials, even, today, the, cost, of, paper, and, books, is, a, barrier, to, universal, literacy, in, some, developing, nations, on, the, other, hand, historian, harvey, graff, argues, that, the, introduction, of, compulsory, education, was, in, part, an, effort, to, control, the, type, of, literacy, the, working, class, had, access, to, according, to, graff, learning, was, increasing, outside, of, formal, settings, e, g, schools, and, this, uncontrolled, potentially, critical, reading, could, lead, to, increased, radicalization, of, the, populace, in, his, view, mass, schooling, was, meant, to, temper, and, control, literacy, not, spread, it, graff, also, says, using, the, example, of, sweden, that, mass, literacy, can, be, achieved, without, formal, schooling, or, instruction, in, writing, in, the, last, 40, years, the, rate, of, illiteracy, in, mexico, has, been, steadily, decreasing, in, the, 1960s, because, the, majority, of, the, residents, of, the, federal, capital, were, illiterate, the, planners, of, the, mexico, city, metro, designed, a, series, of, unique, icons, to, identify, each, station, in, the, system, in, addition, to, its, formal, name, the, inegi, s, census, data, in, 1970, showed, a, national, average, illiteracy, rate, of, 25, 8, which, had, decreased, to, under, 7, by, the, 2010, census, mexico, still, has, a, gender, educational, bias, the, illiteracy, rate, for, women, was, 8, 1, compared, with, 5, 6, for, men, rates, differ, across, regions, and, states, the, states, with, the, highest, poverty, rate, had, greater, than, 15, illiteracy, in, 2010, 17, 8, in, chiapas, 16, 7, in, guerrero, and, 16, 3, in, oaxaca, in, contrast, the, illiteracy, rates, in, the, federal, district, now, part, of, mexico, city, and, in, some, northern, states, like, nuevo, le, n, baja, california, and, coahuila, were, below, 3, in, the, 2010, census, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 6, and, 2, 6, respectively, in, 1964, paulo, freire, was, arrested, and, exiled, for, teaching, peasants, to, read, however, since, democracy, returned, to, brazil, there, has, been, a, steady, increase, in, the, percentage, of, literate, people, educators, with, the, ax, project, in, the, city, of, salvador, bah, a, attempt, to, improve, literacy, rates, among, urban, youth, especially, youth, living, on, the, streets, through, the, use, of, cultural, music, and, dances, then, they, are, encouraged, to, go, on, learning, and, become, professional, artists, 284, the, literacy, rates, in, africa, vary, significantly, between, countries, the, registered, literacy, rate, in, libya, was, 86, 1, in, 2004, and, unesco, says, that, the, literacy, rate, in, the, region, of, equatorial, guinea, is, approximately, 95, while, the, literacy, rate, in, south, sudan, is, approximately, 27, in, sub, saharan, africa, youth, from, wealthier, families, often, have, more, educational, opportunities, to, become, literate, than, poorer, youth, who, may, need, to, leave, school, because, they, are, needed, at, home, to, farm, or, care, for, siblings, additionally, the, rate, of, literacy, has, not, improved, enough, to, compensate, for, the, effects, of, demographic, growth, as, a, result, the, number, of, illiterate, adults, has, risen, by, 27, over, the, last, 20, years, reaching, 169, million, in, 2010, thus, out, of, the, 775, million, illiterate, adults, in, the, world, in, 2010, more, than, one, fifth, 20, were, in, sub, saharan, africa, the, countries, with, the, lowest, levels, of, literacy, in, the, world, are, also, concentrated, in, this, region, where, adult, literacy, rates, can, be, well, below, 50, the, literacy, rate, in, algeria, is, around, 70, which, is, attributed, to, the, fact, that, education, is, compulsory, and, free, up, to, age, 17, burkina, faso, has, a, very, low, literacy, rate, of, 28, 7, defined, as, anyone, at, least, 15, years, of, age,
