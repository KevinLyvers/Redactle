embarrassed, individual, demonstrates, that, he, she, is, at, least, disturbed, by, the, fact, and, may, prove, worthy, at, another, time, semin, and, manstead, demonstrated, social, functions, of, embarrassment, whereby, the, perpetrator, of, knocking, over, a, sales, display, the, bad, act, was, deemed, more, likable, by, others, if, he, she, appeared, embarrassed, than, if, he, she, appeared, unconcerned, regardless, of, restitution, behavior, rebuilding, the, display, the, capacity, to, experience, embarrassment, can, also, be, seen, as, functional, for, the, group, or, culture, it, has, been, demonstrated, that, those, who, are, not, prone, to, embarrassment, are, more, likely, to, engage, in, antisocial, behavior, for, example, adolescent, boys, who, displayed, more, embarrassment, were, found, less, likely, to, engage, in, aggressive, delinquent, behaviors, similarly, embarrassment, exhibited, by, boys, more, likely, to, engage, in, aggressive, delinquent, behavior, was, less, than, one, third, of, that, exhibited, by, non, aggressive, boys, thus, proneness, to, embarrassment, i, e, a, concern, for, how, one, is, evaluated, by, others, can, act, as, a, brake, on, behavior,

as, more, empathic, are, more, likely, to, experience, vicarious, embarrassment, the, effect, is, present, whether, or, not, the, observed, party, is, aware, of, the, embarrassing, nature, of, their, actions, although, awareness, generally, increases, the, strength, of, the, felt, vicarious, embarrassment, as, does, an, accidental, as, opposed, to, intentional, action, one, typology, of, embarrassment, is, described, by, sharkey, and, stafford, there, are, six, types, of, embarrassment, another, typology, by, cupach, and, metts, discusses, the, dimensions, of, intended, unintended, and, appropriate, inappropriate, behavior, and, four, basic, types, of, embarrassing, circumstances, based, on, these, types, cupach, and, metts, classify, two, basic, embarrassment, situations, the, actor, responsible, and, the, observer, responsible, actor, responsible, situations, are, embarrassing, when, a, person, executes, an, act, that, is, either, inappropriate, to, a, point, of, proficiency, matching, social, norms, and, expectations, inconsistent, with, role, expectations, or, is, out, of, sync, with, a, social, identity, the, observer, responsible, categories, are, embarrassing, when, an, individual, becomes, the, focus, of, attention, through, the, first, known, written, occurrence, of, embarrass, in, english, was, in, 1664, by, samuel, pepys, in, his, diary, the, word, derives, from, the, french, word, embarrasser, to, block, or, obstruct, whose, first, recorded, usage, was, by, michel, de, montaigne, in, 1580, the, french, word, was, derived, from, the, spanish, embarazar, whose, first, recorded, usage, was, in, 1460, in, cancionero, de, st, iga, songbook, of, st, iga, by, lvaro, de, luna, the, spanish, word, comes, from, the, portuguese, embara, ar, which, is, a, combination, of, the, prefix, em, from, latin, im, for, in, with, bara, o, or, bara, a, a, noose, or, rope, bara, a, originated, before, the, romans, began, their, conquest, of, the, iberian, peninsula, in, 218, bc, thus, bara, a, could, be, related, to, the, celtic, word, barr, tuft, celtic, people, actually, settled, much, of, spain, and, portugal, beginning, in, the, 8th, century, bc, however, it, certainly, is, not, directly, derived, from, it, as, the, substitution, of, r, for, rr, in, ibero, romantic, languages, was, not, a, known, occurrence, the, spanish, word, may, come, from, the, italian, imbarazzare, from, imbarazzo, obstacle, or, obstruction, that, word, came, from, imbarrare, to, block, or, bar, which, is, a, combination, of, in, in, with, barra, bar, from, the, vulgar, latin, barra, which, is, of, unknown, origin, the, problem, with, this, theory, is, that, the, first, known, usage, of, the, word, in, italian, was, by, bernardo, davanzati, 1529, 1606, long, after, the, word, had, entered, spanish, embarrassing, another, person, is, considered, to, be, a, serious, sin, in, judaism, rabbis, quoted, in, the, babylonian, talmud, state, that, embarrassing, another, person, in, public, is, akin, to, murder, literally, spilling, blood, rabbi, na, man, bar, yitz, ak, responds, by, noting, how, the, analogy, of, spilling, blood, is, apt, since, when, a, person, is, embarrassed, their, face, becomes, less, flushed, and, more, pale, after, the, initial, flush, notes, sources
