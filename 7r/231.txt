primitive, adivasis, were, usually, not, held, to, be, intrinsically, impure, by, surrounding, populations, usually, dravidian, or, indo, aryan, unlike, dalits, who, were, thus, the, adivasi, origins, of, valmiki, who, composed, the, ramayana, were, acknowledged, as, were, the, origins, of, adivasi, tribes, such, as, the, garasia, and, bhilala, which, descended, from, mixed, rajput, and, bhil, marriages, unlike, the, subjugation, of, the, dalits, the, adivasis, often, enjoyed, autonomy, and, depending, on, region, evolved, mixed, hunter, gatherer, and, farming, economies, controlling, their, lands, as, a, joint, patrimony, of, the, tribe, in, some, areas, securing, adivasi, approval, and, support, was, considered, crucial, by, local, rulers, and, larger, adivasi, groups, were,

region, and, were, not, only, the, hereditary, leaders, of, their, gond, subjects, but, also, held, sway, over, substantial, communities, of, non, tribals, who, recognized, them, as, their, feudal, lords, the, historiography, of, relationships, between, the, adivasis, and, the, rest, of, indian, society, is, patchy, there, are, references, to, alliances, between, ahom, kings, of, brahmaputra, valley, and, the, hill, nagas, this, relative, autonomy, and, collective, ownership, of, adivasi, land, by, adivasis, was, severely, disrupted, by, the, advent, of, the, mughals, in, the, early, 16th, century, rebellions, against, mughal, authority, include, the, bhil, rebellion, of, 1632, and, the, bhil, gond, insurrection, of, 1643, which, were, both, pacified, by, mughal, soldiers, with, the, advent, of, the, kachwaha, rajputs, and, mughals, into, their, territory, the, meenas, were, gradually, sidelined, and, pushed, deep, into, the, forests, as, a, result, historical, literature, has, completely, bypassed, the, meena, tribe, the, combined, army, of, mughals, and, bharmal, attacked, the, tribal, king, bada, meena, and, killed, him, damaging, 52, kots, and, 56, gates, bada, s, treasure, was, shared, between, mughals, and, bharmal, during, the, period, of, british, rule, the, colonial, administration, encroached, upon, the, adivasi, tribal, system, which, led, to, widespread, resentment, against, the, british, among, the, tribesmen, the, tribesmen, frequently, supported, rebellions, or, rebelled, themselves, while, their, raja, looked, negatively, upon, the, british, administrative, innovations, beginning, in, the, 18th, century, the, british, added, to, the, consolidation, of, feudalism, in, india, first, under, the, jagirdari, system, and, then, under, the, zamindari, system, beginning, with, the, permanent, settlement, imposed, by, the, british, in, bengal, and, bihar, which, later, became, the, template, for, a, deepening, of, feudalism, throughout, india, the, older, social, and, economic, system, in, the, country, began, to, alter, radically, land, both, forest, areas, belonging, to, adivasis, and, settled, farmland, belonging, to, non, adivasi, peasants, was, rapidly, made, the, legal, property, of, british, designated, zamindars, landlords, who, in, turn, moved, to, extract, the, maximum, economic, benefit, possible, from, their, newfound, property, and, subjects, adivasi, lands, sometimes, experienced, an, influx, of, non, local, settlers, often, brought, from, far, away, as, in, the, case, of, muslims, and, sikhs, brought, to, kol, territory, by, the, zamindars, to, better, exploit, local, land, forest, and, labour, deprived, of, the, forests, and, resources, they, traditionally, depended, on, and, sometimes, coerced, to, pay, taxes, many, adivasis, were, forced, to, borrow, at, usurious, rates, from, moneylenders, often, the, zamindars, themselves, when, they, were, unable, to, pay, that, forced, them, to, become, bonded, labourers, for, the, zamindars, often, far, from, paying, off, the, principal, of, their, debt, they, were, unable, even, to, offset, the, compounding, interest, and, this, was, made, the, justification, for, their, children, working, for, the, zamindar, after, the, death, of, the, initial, borrower, in, the, case, of, the, andamanese, adivasis, their, protective, isolation, changed, with, the, establishment, of, a, british, colonial, presence, on, the, islands, lacking, immunity, against, common, infectious, diseases, of, the, eurasian, mainland, the, large, jarawa, habitats, on, the, southeastern, regions, of, south, andaman, island, experienced, a, massive, population, decline, due, to, disease, within, four, years, of, the, establishment, of, a, colonial, presence, on, the, island, in, 1789, land, dispossession, by, the, zamindars, or, interference, by, the, colonial, government, resulted, in, a, number, of, adivasi, revolts, in, the, late, eighteenth, and, early, nineteenth, centuries, such, as, the, bhumij, rebellion, of, 1767, 1833, and, santal, hul, or, santhal, rebellion, of, 1855, 56, although, these, were, suppressed, by, the, governing, british, authority, the, east, india, company, prior, to, 1858, and, the, british, government, after, 1858, partial, restoration, of, privileges, to, adivasi, elites, e, g, to, mankis, the, leaders, of, munda, tribes, and, some, leniency, in, levels, of, taxation, resulted, in, relative, calm, in, the, region, despite, continuing, and, widespread, dispossession, from, the, late, nineteenth, century, onwards, the, economic, deprivation, in, some, cases, triggered, internal, adivasi, migrations, within, india, that, would, continue, for, another, century, including, as, labour, for, the, emerging, tea, plantations, in, assam, there, were, tribal, reform, and, rebellion, movements, during, the, period, of, the, british, empire, some, of, which, also, participated, in, the, indian, independence, movement, or, attacked, mission, posts, there, were, several, adivasis, in, the, indian, independence, movement, including, birsa, munda, dharindhar, bhyuan, laxman, naik, jantya, bhil,

the, british, government, used, to, support, these, claims, as, they, viewed, the, adivasi, society, to, be, less, civilized, than, the, caste, society, and, believed, that, adivasi, peoples,

has, been, one, of, the, reasons, for, poor, performance, of, tribal, students, in, schools, poor, literacy, rate, since, independence, has, resulted, in, absence, of, tribals, in, academia, and, higher, education, the, literacy, rate, for, sts, has, gone, up, from, 8, 5, male, 13, 8, female, 3, 2, in, 1961, to, 29, 6, male, 40, 6, female, 18, 2, in, 1991, and, to, 40, male, 59, female, 37, in, 1999, 2000, states, with, large, proportion, of, sts, like, mizoram, nagaland, and, meghalaya, have, high, literacy, rate, while, states, with, large, number, of, tribals, like, madhya, pradesh, odisha, rajasthan, and, andhra, pradesh, have, low, tribal, literacy, rate, tribal, students, have, very, high, drop, out, rates, during, school, education, extending, the, system, of, primary, education, into, tribal, areas, and, reserving, places, for, needing, them, they, say, to, work, in, the, fields, on, the, other, hand, in, those, parts, of, the, northeast, where, tribes, have, generally, been, spared, the, wholesale, onslaught, of, outsiders, schooling, has, helped, tribal, people, to, secure, political, and, economic, benefits, the, education, system, there, has, provided, a, corps, of, highly, trained, tribal, members, in, the, professions, and, high, ranking, administrative, posts, tribal, children, in, middle, and, high, schools, and, higher, education, institutions, are, central, to, government, policy, but, efforts, to, improve, a, tribe, s, educational, status, have, had, mixed, results, recruitment, of, qualified, teachers, and, determination, of, the, appropriate, language, of, instruction, also, remain, troublesome, commission, after, commission, on, the, language, question, has, called, for, instruction, at, least, at, the, primary, level, in, the, students, native, language, in, some, regions, tribal, children, entering, school, must, begin, by, learning, the, official, regional, language, often, one, completely, unrelated, to, their, tribal, language, many, tribal, schools, are, plagued, by, high, drop, out, rates, children, attend, for, the, first, three, to, four, years, of, primary, school, and, gain, a, smattering, of, knowledge, only, to, lapse, into, illiteracy, later, few, who, enter, continue, up, to, the, tenth, grade, of, those, who, do, few, manage, to, finish, high, school, therefore, very, few, are, eligible, to, attend, institutions, of, higher, education, where, the, high, rate, of, attrition, continues, members, of, agrarian, tribes, like, the, gonds, often, are, reluctant, to, send, their, children, to, school, an, academy, for, teaching, and, preserving, adivasi, languages, and, culture, was, established, in, 1999, by, the, bhasha, research, and, publication, centre, the, adivasi, academy, is, located, at, tejgadh, in, gujarat, most, tribes, are, concentrated, in, heavily, forested, areas, that, combine, inaccessibility, with, limited, political, or, economic, significance, historically, the, economy, of, most, tribes, was, subsistence, agriculture, or, hunting, and, gathering, tribal, members, traded, with, outsiders, for, the, few, necessities, they, lacked, such, as, salt, and, iron, a, few, local, hindu, craftsmen, might, provide, such, items, as, cooking, utensils, in, the, early, 20th, century, however, large, areas, fell, into, the, hands, of, non, tribals, on, account, of, improved, transportation, and, communications, around, 1900, many, regions, were, opened, by, the, british, government, to, settlement, through, a, scheme, by, which, inward, migrants, received, ownership, of, land, free, in, return, for, cultivating, it, for, tribal, people, however, land, was, often, viewed, as, a, common, resource, free, to, whoever, needed, it, by, the, time, tribals, accepted, the, necessity, of, obtaining, formal, land, titles, they, had, lost, the, opportunity, to, lay, claim, to, lands, that, might, rightfully, have, been, considered, theirs, the, colonial, and, post, independence, regimes, belatedly, realised, the, necessity, of, protecting, tribals, from, the, predations, of, outsiders, and, prohibited, the, sale, of, tribal, lands, although, an, important, loophole, in, the, form, of, land, leases, was, left, open, tribes, made, some, gains, in, the, mid, twentieth, century, and, some, land, was, returned, to, tribal, peoples, despite, obstruction, by, local, police, and, land, officials, in, the, 1970s, tribal, peoples, came, again, under, intense, land, pressure, especially, in, central, india, migration, into, tribal, lands, increased, dramatically, as, tribal, people, lost, the, titles, to, their, lands, in, many, ways, lease, forfeiture, from, debts, or, bribery, of, land, registry, officials, other, non, tribals, simply, squatted, or, even, lobbied, governments, to, classify, them, as, tribal, to, allow, them, to, compete, with, the, formerly, established, tribes, in, any, case, many, tribal, members, became, landless, labourers, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, and, regions, that, a, few, years, earlier, had, been, the, exclusive, domain, of, tribes, had, an, increasingly, mixed, population, of, tribals, and, non, tribals, government, efforts, to, evict, nontribal, members, from, illegal, occupation, have, proceeded, slowly, when, evictions, occur, at, all, those, ejected, are, usually, members, of, poor, lower, castes, improved, communications, roads, with, motorised, traffic, and, more, frequent, government, intervention, figured, in, the, increased, contact, that, tribal, peoples, had, with, outsiders, commercial, highways, and, cash, crops, frequently, drew, non, tribal, people, into, remote, areas, by, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, the, resident, nontribal, shopkeeper, was, a, permanent, feature, of, many, tribal, villages, since, shopkeepers, often, sell, goods, on, credit, demanding, high, interest, many, tribal, members, have, been, drawn, deeply, into, debt, or, mortgaged, their, land, merchants, also, encourage, tribals, to, grow, cash, crops, such, as, cotton, or, castor, oil, plants, which, increases, tribal, dependence, on, the, market, for, necessities, indebtedness, is, so, extensive, that, although, such, transactions, are, illegal, traders, sometimes, sell, their, debtors, to, other, merchants, much, like, indentured, peons, the, final, blow, for, some, tribes, has, come, when, non, tribals, through, political, jockeying, have, managed, to, gain, legal, tribal, status, that, is, to, be, listed, as, a, scheduled, tribe, tribes, in, the, himalayan, foothills, have, not, been, as, hard, pressed, by, the, intrusions, of, non, tribal, historically, their, political, status, was, always, distinct, from, the, rest, of, india, until, the, british, colonial, period, there, was, little, effective, control, by, any, of, the, empires, centred, in, peninsular, india, the, region, was, populated, by, autonomous, feuding, tribes, the, british, in, efforts, to, protect, the, sensitive, northeast, frontier, followed, a, policy, dubbed, the, inner, line, non, tribal, people, were, allowed, into, the, areas, only, with, special, permission, post, colonial, governments, have, continued, the, policy, protecting, the, himalayan, tribes, as, part, of, the, strategy, to, secure, the, border, with, china, many, smaller, tribal, groups, are, quite, sensitive, to, ecological, degradation, caused, by, modernisation, both, commercial, forestry, and, intensive, agriculture, have, proved, destructive, to, the, forests, that, had, endured, swidden, agriculture, for, many, centuries, adivasis, in, central, part, of, india, have, been, victims, of, the, salwa, judum, campaign, by, the, government, against, the, naxalite, insurgency, government, policies, on, forest, reserves, have, affected, tribal, peoples, profoundly, government, efforts, to, reserve, forests, have, precipitated, armed, if, futile, resistance, on, the, part, of, the, tribal, peoples, involved, intensive, exploitation, of, forests, has, often, meant, allowing, outsiders, to, cut, large, areas, of, trees, while, the, original, tribal, inhabitants, were, restricted, from, cutting, and, ultimately, replacing, mixed, forests, capable, of, sustaining, tribal, life, with, single, product, plantations, non, tribals, have, frequently, bribed, local, officials, to, secure, the, effective, use, of, reserved, forest, lands, the, northern, tribes, have, thus, been, sheltered, from, the, kind, of, exploitation, that, those, elsewhere, in, south, asia, have, suffered, in, arunachal, pradesh, formerly, part, of, the, north, east, frontier, agency, for, example, tribal, members, control, commerce, and, most, lower, level, administrative, posts, government, construction, projects, in, the, region, have, provided, tribes, with, a, significant, source, of, cash, some, tribes, have, made, rapid, progress, through, the, education, system, the, role, of, early, missionaries, was, significant, in, this, regard, instruction, was, begun, in, assamese, but, was, eventually, changed, to, hindi, by, the, early, 1980s, english, was, taught, at, most, levels, northeastern, tribal, people, have, thus, enjoyed, a, certain, measure, of, social, mobility, the, continuing, economic, alienation, and, exploitation, of, many, adivasis, was, highlighted, as, a, systematic, failure, by, the, indian, prime, minister, manmohan, singh, in, a, 2009, conference, of, chief, ministers, of, all, 29, indian, states, where, he, also, cited, this, as, a, major, cause, of, the, naxalite, unrest, that, has, affected, areas, such, as, the, red, corridor, the, criteria, presently, followed, for, specification, of, a, community, as, a, scheduled, tribe, are, i, indications, of, primitive, traits, ii, distinctive, culture, iii, geographical, isolation, iv, shyness, of, contact, with, the, community, at, large, and, v, backwardness, population, complexities, and, the, controversies, surrounding, ethnicity, and, language, in, india, sometimes, make, the, official, recognition, of, groups, as, adivasis, by, way, of, inclusion, in, the, scheduled, tribes, list, political, and, contentious, however, regardless, of, their, language, family, affiliations, australoid, and, negrito, groups, that, have, survived, as, distinct, forest, mountain, or, island, dwelling, tribes, in, india, and, are, often, classified, as, adivasi, the, relatively, autonomous, tribal, groups, of, northeastern, india, including, khasis, apatani, and, nagas, who, are, mostly, austro, asiatic, or, tibeto, burman, speakers, are, also, considered, to, be, tribals, this, area, comprises, 7, 5, of, india, s, land, area, but, 20, of, its, tribal, population, however, not, all, autonomous, northeastern, groups, are, considered, tribals, for, instance, the, tibeto, burman, speaking, meitei, of, manipur, were, once, tribal, but, having, been, settled, for, many, centuries, are, caste, hindus, it, is, also, difficult, for, a, given, social, grouping, to, definitively, decide, whether, it, is, a, caste, or, a, tribe, a, combination, of, internal, social, organisation, relationship, with, other, groups, self, classification, and, perception, by, other, groups, has, to, be, taken, into, account, to, make, a, categorisation, which, is, at, best, inexact, and, open, to, doubt, these, categorisations, have, been, diffused, for, thousands, of, years, and, even, ancient, formulators, of, caste, discriminatory, legal, codes, which, usually, only, applied, to, settled, populations, and, not, adivasis, were, unable, to, come, up, with, clean, distinctions, the, additional, difficulty, in, deciding, whether, a, group, meets, the, criteria, to, be, adivasi, or, not, are, the, aspirational, movements, created, by, the, federal, and, state, benefits, including, job, and, educational, reservations, enjoyed, by, groups, listed, as, scheduled, tribes, sts, in, manipur, meitei, commentators, have, pointed, to, the, lack, of, scheduled, tribe, status, as, a, key, economic, disadvantage, for, meiteis, competing, for, jobs, against, groups, that, are, classified, as, scheduled, tribes, in, assam, rajbongshi, representatives, have, demanded, scheduled, tribe, status, as, well, in, rajasthan, the, gujjar, community, has, demanded, st, status, even, blockading, the, national, capital, of, delhi, to, press, their, demand, however, the, government, of, rajasthan, declined, the, gujjars, demand, stating, the, gujjars, are, treated, as, upper, caste, and, are, by, no, means, a, tribe, in, several, cases, these, claims, to, tribalhood, are, disputed, by, tribes, who, are, already, listed, in, the, schedule, and, fear, economic, losses, if, more, powerful, groups, are, recognised, as, scheduled, tribes, for, instance, the, rajbongshi, demand, faces, resistance, from, the, bodo, tribe, and, the, meena, tribe, has, vigorously, opposed, gujjar, aspirations, to, be, recognised, as, a, scheduled, tribe, part, of, the, challenge, is, that, the, endogamous, nature, of, tribes, is, also, conformed, to, by, the, vast, majority, of, hindu, castes, indeed, many, historians, and, anthropologists, believe, that, caste, endogamy, reflects, the, once, tribal, origins, of, the, various, groups, who, now, constitute, the, settled, hindu, castes, another, defining, feature, of, caste, hindu, society, which, is, often, used, to, contrast, them, with, muslim, and, other, social, groupings, is, lineage, clan, or, gotra, and, village, exogamy, however, these, in, marriage, taboos, are, also, held, ubiquitously, among, tribal, groups, and, do, not, serve, as, reliable, differentiating, markers, between, caste, and, tribe, again, this, could, be, an, ancient, import, from, tribal, society, into, settled, hindu, castes, tribes, such, as, the, muslim, gujjars, of, kashmir, and, the, kalash, of, pakistan, observe, these, exogamous, traditions, in, common, with, caste, hindus, and, non, kashmiri, adivasis, though, their, surrounding, muslim, populations, do, not, tribals, are, not, part, of, the, caste, system, some, anthropologists, however, draw, a, distinction, between, tribes, who, have, continued, to, be, tribal, and, tribes, that, have, been, absorbed, into, caste, society, in, terms, of, the, breakdown, of, tribal, and, therefore, caste, boundaries, and, the, proliferation, of, new, mixed, caste, groups, in, other, words, ethnogenesis, the, construction, of, new, ethnic, identities, in, tribes, occurs, through, a, fission, process, where, groups, splinter, off, as, new, tribes, which, preserves, endogamy, whereas, with, settled, castes, it, usually, occurs, through, intermixture, in, violation, of, strict, endogamy, tribals, and, are, often, regarded, as, constituting, egalitarian, societies, however, many, scholars, argue, that, the, claim, that, tribals, are, an, egalitarian, society, in, contrast, to, a, caste, based, society, is, a, part, of, a, larger, political, agenda, by, some, to, maximise, any, differences, from, tribal, and, urban, societies, according, to, scholar, koenraad, elst, caste, practices, and, social, taboos, among, indian, tribals, date, back, to, antiquity, the, munda, tribals, not, only, practise, tribal, endogamy, and, commensality, but, also, observe, a, j, ti, division, within, the, tribe, buttressed, by, notions, of, social, pollution, a, mythological, explanation, and, harsh, punishments, unlike, castes, which, form, part, of, a, complex, and, interrelated, local, economic, exchange, system, tribes, tend, to, form, self, sufficient, economic, units, for, most, tribal, people, land, use, rights, traditionally, derive, simply, from, tribal, membership, tribal, society, tends, to, the, egalitarian, with, its, leadership, based, on, ties, of, kinship, and, personality, rather, than, on, hereditary, status, tribes, typically, consist, of, segmentary, lineages, whose, extended, families, provide, the, basis, for, social, organisation, and, control, tribal, religion, recognises, no, authority, outside, the, tribe, any, of, these, criteria, may, not, apply, in, specific, instances, language, does, not, always, give, an, accurate, indicator, of, tribal, or, caste, status, especially, in, regions, of, mixed, population, many, tribal, groups, have, lost, their, original, languages, and, simply, speak, local, or, regional, languages, in, parts, of, assam, an, area, historically, divided, between, warring, tribes, and, villages, increased, contact, among, villagers, began, during, the, colonial, period, and, has, accelerated, since, independence, in, 1947, a, pidgin, assamese, developed, whereas, educated, tribal, members, learnt, hindi, and, in, the, late, twentieth, century, english, self, identification, and, group, loyalty, do, not, provide, unfailing, markers, of, tribal, identity, either, in, the, case, of, stratified, tribes, the, loyalties, of, clan, kin, and, family, may, well, predominate, over, those, of, tribe, in, addition, tribes, cannot, always, be, viewed, as, people, living, apart, the, degree, of, isolation, of, various, tribes, has, varied, tremendously, the, gonds, santals, and, bhils, traditionally, have, dominated, the, regions, in, which, they, have, lived, moreover, tribal, society, is, not, always, more, egalitarian, than, the, rest, of, the, rural, populace, some, of, the, larger, tribes, such, as, the, gonds, are, highly, stratified, the, apparently, wide, fluctuation, in, estimates, of, south, asia, s, tribal, population, through, the, twentieth, century, gives, a, sense, of, how, unclear, the, distinction, between, tribal, and, nontribal, can, be, india, s, 1931, census, enumerated, 22, million, tribal, people, in, 1941, only, 10, million, were, counted, but, by, 1961, some, 30, million, and, in, 1991, nearly, 68, million, tribal, members, were, included, the, differences, among, the, figures, reflect, changing, census, criteria, and, the, economic, incentives, individuals, have, to, maintain, or, reject, classification, as, a, tribal, member, these, gyrations, of, census, data, serve, to, underline, the, complex, relationship, between, caste, and, tribe, although, in, theory, these, terms, represent, different, ways, of, life, and, ideal, types, in, reality, they, stand, for, a, continuum, of, social, groups, in, areas, of, substantial, contact, between, tribes, and, castes, social, and, cultural, pressures, have, often, tended, to, move, tribes, in, the, direction, of, becoming, castes, over, a, period, of, years, tribal, peoples, with, ambitions, for, social, advancement, in, indian, society, at, large, have, tried, to,
