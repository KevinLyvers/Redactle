a, generation, is, all, of, the, people, born, and, living, at, about, the, same, time, regarded, collectively, it, also, is, the, average, period, generally, considered, to, be, about, 20, 30, years, during, which, children, are, born, and, grow, up, become, adults, and, begin, to, have, children, in, kinship, generation, is, a, structural, term, designating, the, parent, child, relationship, in, biology, generation, also, means, biogenesis, reproduction, and, procreation, generation, is, also, a, synonym, for, birth, age, cohort, in, demographics, marketing, and, social, science, where, it, means, people, within, a, delineated, population, who, experience, the, same, significant, events, within, a, given, period, of, time, the, term, generation, in, this, sense, also, known, as, social, generations, is, widely, used, in, popular, culture, and, is, a, basis, of, sociological, analysis, serious, analysis, of, generations, began, in, the, nineteenth, century, emerging, from, an, increasing, awareness, of, the, possibility, of, permanent, social, change, and, the, idea, of, youthful, rebellion, against, the, established, social, order, some, analysts, believe, that, a, generation, is, one, of, the, fundamental, social, categories, in, a, society, others, consider, generation, less, important, than, class, gender, race, and, education, the, word, generate, comes, from, the, latin, gener, re, meaning, to, beget, the, word, generation, as, a, group, or, cohort, in, social, science, signifies, the, entire, body, of, individuals, born, and, living, at, about, the, same, time, most, of, whom, are, approximately, the, same, age, and, have, similar, ideas, problems, and, attitudes, e, g, beat, generation, and, lost, generation, a, familial, generation, is, a, group, of, living, beings, constituting, a, single, step, in, the, line, of, descent, from, an, ancestor, in, developed, nations, the, average, familial, generation, length, is, in, the, high, 20s, and, has, even, reached, 30, years, in, some, nations, factors, such, as, greater, industrialisation, and, demand, for, cheap, labour, urbanisation, delayed, first, pregnancy, and, a, greater, uncertainty, in, both, employment, income, and, relationship, stability, have, all, contributed, to, the, increase, of, the, generation, length, from, the, late, 18th, century, to, the, present, these, changes, can, be, attributed, to, social, factors, such, as, gdp, and, state, policy, globalization, automation, and, related, individual, level, variables, particularly, a, woman, s, educational, attainment, conversely, in, less, developed, nations, generation, length, has, changed, little, and, remains, in, the, low, 20s, an, intergenerational, rift, in, the, nuclear, family, between, the, parents, and, two, or, more, of, their, children, is, one, of, several, possible, dynamics, of, a, dysfunctional, family, coalitions, in, families, are, subsystems, within, families, with, more, rigid, boundaries, and, are, thought, to, be, a, sign, of, family, dysfunction, social, generations, are, cohorts, of, people, born, in, the, same, date, range, and, who, share, similar, cultural, experiences, the, idea, of, a, social, generation, has, a, long, history, and, can, be, found, in, ancient, literature, but, did, not, gain, currency, in, the, sense, that, it, is, used, today, until, the, 19th, century, prior, to, that, the, concept, generation, had, generally, referred, to, family, relationships, and, not, broader, social, groupings, in, 1863, the, french, lexicographer, emile, littr, had, defined, a, generation, as, all, people, coexisting, in, society, at, any, given, time, 19, several, trends, promoted, a, new, idea, of, generations, as, the, 19th, century, wore, on, of, a, society, divided, into, different, categories, of, people, based, on, age, these, trends, were, all, related, to, the, processes, of, modernisation, industrialisation, or, westernisation, which, had, been, changing, the, face, of, europe, since, the, mid, 18th, century, one, was, a, change, in, mentality, about, time, and, social, change, the, increasing, prevalence, of, enlightenment, ideas, encouraged, the, idea, that, society, and, life, were, changeable, and, that, civilization, could, progress, this, encouraged, the, equation, of, youth, with, social, renewal, and, change, political, rhetoric, in, the, 19th, century, often, focused, on, the, renewing, power, of, youth, influenced, by, movements, such, as, young, italy, young, germany, sturm, und, drang, the, german, youth, movement, and, other, romantic, movements, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, european, intellectuals, were, disposed, toward, thinking, of, the, world, in, generational, terms, in, terms, of, youth, rebellion, and, emancipation, one, important, contributing, factor, to, the, change, in, mentality, was, the, change, in, the, economic, structure, of, society, because, of, the, rapid, social, and, economic, change, young, men, particularly, were, less, beholden, to, their, fathers, and, family, authority, than, they, had, been, greater, social, and, economic, mobility, allowed, them, to, flout, their, authority, to, a, much, greater, extent, than, had, traditionally, been, possible, additionally, the, skills, and, wisdom, of, fathers, were, often, less, valuable, than, they, had, been, due, to, technological, and, social, change, during, this, time, the, period, between, childhood, and, adulthood, usually, spent, at, university, or, in, military, service, was, also, increased, for, many, white, collar, workers, this, category, of, people, was, very, influential, in, spreading, the, ideas, of, youthful, renewal, another, important, factor, was, the, breakdown, of, traditional, social, and, regional, identifications, the, spread, of, nationalism, and, many, of, the, factors, that, created, it, a, national, press, linguistic, homogenisation, public, education, suppression, of, local, particularities, encouraged, a, broader, sense, of, belonging, beyond, local, affiliations, people, thought, of, themselves, increasingly, as, part, of, a, society, and, this, encouraged, identification, with, groups, beyond, the, local, auguste, comte, was, the, first, philosopher, to, make, a, serious, attempt, to, systematically, study, generations, in, cours, de, philosophie, positive, comte, suggested, that, social, change, is, determined, by, generational, change, and, in, particular, conflict, between, successive, generations, as, the, members, of, a, given, generation, age, their, instinct, of, social, conservation, becomes, stronger, which, inevitably, and, necessarily, brings, them, into, conflict, with, the, normal, attribute, of, youth, innovation, other, important, theorists, of, the, 19th, century, were, john, stuart, mill, and, wilhelm, dilthey, the, sociologist, karl, mannheim, was, a, seminal, figure, in, the, study, of, generations, he, elaborated, a, theory, of, generations, in, his, 1923, essay, the, problem, of, generations, he, suggested, that, there, had, been, a, division, into, two, primary, schools, of, study, of, generations, until, that, time, firstly, positivists, such, as, comte, measured, social, change, in, designated, life, spans, mannheim, argued, that, this, reduced, history, to, a, chronological, table, the, other, school, the, romantic, historical, was, represented, by, dilthey, and, martin, heidegger, this, school, focused, on, the, individual, qualitative, experience, at, the, expense, of, social, context, mannheim, emphasised, that, the, rapidity, of, social, change, in, youth, was, crucial, to, the, formation, of, generations, and, that, not, every, generation, would, come, to, see, itself, as, distinct, in, periods, of, rapid, social, change, a, generation, would, be, much, more, likely, to, develop, a, cohesive, character, he, also, believed, that, a, number, of, distinct, sub, generations, could, exist, according, to, gilleard, and, higgs, mannheim, identified, three, commonalities, that, a, generation, shares, mannheim, elaborated, on, the, meaning, of, a, generation, s, location, lagerung, understood, in, a, historical, economic, and, sociocultural, sense, in, 1928, he, wrote, the, fact, that, people, are, born, at, the, same, time, or, that, their, youth, adulthood, and, old, age, coincide, does, not, in, itself, involve, similarity, of, location, what, does, create, a, similar, location, is, that, they, are, in, a, position, to, experience, the, same, events, and, data, etc, and, especially, that, these, experiences, impinge, upon, a, similarly, stratified, consciousness, it, is, not, difficult, to, see, why, mere, chronological, contemporaneity, cannot, of, itself, produce, a, common, generation, location, no, one, for, example, would, assert, that, there, was, community, of, location, between, the, young, people, of, china, and, germany, about, 1800, only, where, contemporaries, definitely, are, in, a, position, to, participate, as, an, integrated, group, in, certain, common, experiences, can, we, rightly, speak, of, community, of, location, of, a, generation, one, of, the, implications, is, that, the, chronological, boundaries, often, attributed, to, different, generations, generation, x, millennials, etc, have, little, global, validity, since, these, boundaries, are, mostly, based, on, shared, western, especially, american, historical, and, sociocultural, locations, authors, william, strauss, and, neil, howe, developed, the, strauss, howe, generational, theory, outlining, what, they, saw, as, a, pattern, of, generations, repeating, throughout, american, history, this, theory, became, quite, influential, with, the, public, and, reignited, an, interest, in, the, sociology, of, generations, this, led, to, the, creation, of, an, industry, of, consulting, publishing, and, marketing, in, the, field, corporations, spent, approximately, 70, million, dollars, on, generational, consulting, in, the, u, s, in, 2015, the, theory, has, alternatively, been, criticized, by, social, scientists, and, journalists, who, argue, it, is, non, falsifiable, deterministic, and, unsupported, by, rigorous, evidence, there, are, psychological, and, sociological, dimensions, in, the, sense, of, belonging, and, identity, which, may, define, a, generation, the, concept, of, a, generation, can, be, used, to, locate, particular, birth, cohorts, in, specific, historical, and, cultural, circumstances, such, as, the, baby, boomers, historian, hans, jaeger, shows, that, during, the, concept, s, long, history, two, schools, of, thought, coalesced, regarding, how, generations, form, the, pulse, rate, hypothesis, and, the, imprint, hypothesis, according, to, the, pulse, rate, hypothesis, a, society, s, entire, population, can, be, divided, into, a, series, of, non, overlapping, cohorts, each, of, which, develops, a, unique, peer, personality, because, of, the, time, period, in, which, each, cohort, came, of, age, the, movement, of, these, cohorts, from, one, life, stage, to, the, next, creates, a, repeating, cycle, that, shapes, the, history, of, that, society, a, prominent, example, of, pulse, rate, generational, theory, is, strauss, and, howe, s, theory, social, scientists, tend, to, reject, the, pulse, rate, hypothesis, because, as, jaeger, explains, the, concrete, results, of, the, theory, of, the, universal, pulse, rate, of, history, are, of, course, very, modest, with, a, few, exceptions, the, same, goes, for, the, partial, pulse, rate, theories, since, they, generally, gather, data, without, any, knowledge, of, statistical, principles, the, authors, are, often, least, likely, to, notice, to, what, extent, the, jungle, of, names, and, numbers, which, they, present, lacks, any, convincing, organization, according, to, generations, social, scientists, follow, the, imprint, hypothesis, of, generations, i, e, that, major, historical, events, such, as, the, vietnam, war, the, september, 11, attacks, the, covid, 19, pandemic, etc, leave, an, imprint, on, the, generation, experiencing, them, at, a, young, age, which, can, be, traced, to, karl, mannheim, s, theory, according, to, the, imprint, hypothesis, generations, are, only, produced, by, specific, historical, events, that, cause, young, people, to, perceive, the, world, differently, than, their, elders, thus, not, everyone, may, be, part, of, a, generation, only, those, who, share, a, unique, social, and, biographical, experience, of, an, important, historical, moment, will, become, part, of, a, generation, as, an, actuality, when, following, the, imprint, hypothesis, social, scientists, face, a, number, of, challenges, they, cannot, accept, the, labels, and, chronological, boundaries, of, generations, that, come, from, the, pulse, rate, hypothesis, like, generation, x, or, millennial, instead, the, chronological, boundaries, of, generations, must, be, determined, inductively, and, who, is, part, of, the, generation, must, be, determined, through, historical, quantitative, and, qualitative, analysis, while, all, generations, have, similarities, there, are, differences, among, them, as, well, a, 2007, pew, research, center, report, called, millennials, confident, connected, open, to, change, noted, the, challenge, of, studying, generations, generational, analysis, has, a, long, and, distinguished, place, in, social, science, and, we, cast, our, lot, with, those, scholars, who, believe, it, is, not, only, possible, but, often, highly, illuminating, to, search, for, the, unique, and, distinctive, characteristics, of, any, given, age, group, of, americans, but, we, also, know, this, is, not, an, exact, science, we, are, mindful, that, there, are, as, many, differences, in, attitudes, values, behaviors, and, lifestyles, within, a, generation, as, there, are, between, generations, but, we, believe, this, reality, does, not, diminish, the, value, of, generational, analysis, it, merely, adds, to, its, richness, and, complexity, another, element, of, generational, theory, is, recognizing, how, youth, experience, their, generation, and, how, that, changes, based, on, where, they, reside, in, the, world, analyzing, young, people, s, experiences, in, place, contributes, to, a, deeper, understanding, of, the, processes, of, individualization, inequality, and, of, generation, being, able, to, take, a, closer, looks, at, youth, cultures, and, subcultures, in, different, times, and, places, adds, an, extra, element, to, understanding, the, everyday, lives, of, youth, this, allows, a, better, understanding, of, youth, and, the, role, generation, and, place, play, in, their, development, it, is, not, where, the, birth, cohort, boundaries, are, drawn, that, is, important, but, how, individuals, and, societies, interpret, the, boundaries, and, how, divisions, may, shape, processes, and, outcomes, however, the, practice, of, categorizing, age, cohorts, is, useful, to, researchers, for, the, purpose, of, constructing, boundaries, in, their, work, norman, ryder, writing, in, american, sociological, review, in, 1965, shed, light, on, the, sociology, of, the, discord, between, generations, by, suggesting, that, society, persists, despite, the, mortality, of, its, individual, members, through, processes, of, demographic, metabolism, and, particularly, the, annual, infusion, of, birth, cohorts, he, argued, that, generations, may, sometimes, be, a, threat, to, stability, but, at, the, same, time, they, represent, the, opportunity, for, social, transformation, ryder, attempted, to, understand, the, dynamics, at, play, between, generations, amanda, grenier, in, a, 2007, essay, published, in, journal, of, social, issues, offered, another, source, of, explanation, for, why, generational, tensions, exist, grenier, asserted, that, generations, develop, their, own, linguistic, models, that, contribute, to, misunderstanding, between, age, cohorts, different, ways, of, speaking, exercised, by, older, and, younger, people, exist, and, may, be, partially, explained, by, social, historical, reference, points, culturally, determined, experiences, and, individual, interpretations, karl, mannheim, in, his, 1952, book, essays, on, the, sociology, of, knowledge, asserted, the, belief, that, people, are, shaped, through, lived, experiences, as, a, result, of, social, change, howe, and, strauss, also, have, written, on, the, similarities, of, people, within, a, generation, being, attributed, to, social, change, based, on, the, way, these, lived, experiences, shape, a, generation, in, regard, to, values, the, result, is, that, the, new, generation, will, challenge, the, older, generation, s, values, resulting, in, tension, this, challenge, between, generations, and, the, tension, that, arises, is, a, defining, point, for, understanding, generations, and, what, separates, them, the, western, world, includes, parts, of, western, europe, north, america, and, australasia, many, variations, may, exist, within, these, regions, both, geographically, and, culturally, which, means, that, the, list, is, broadly, indicative, but, very, general, the, contemporary, characterization, of, these, cohorts, used, in, media, and, advertising, borrows, in, part, from, the, strauss, howe, generational, theory, and, generally, follows, the, logic, of, the, pulse, rate, hypothesis, the, term, generation, is, sometimes, applied, to, a, cultural, movement, or, more, narrowly, defined, group, than, an, entire, demographic, some, examples, include, philip, n, cohen, a, sociology, professor, at, the, university, of, maryland, criticized, the, use, of, generation, labels, stating, that, the, labels, are, imposed, by, survey, researchers, journalists, or, marketing, firms, and, drive, people, toward, stereotyping, and, rash, character, judgment, cohen, s, open, letter, to, the, pew, research, center, which, outlines, his, criticism, of, generational, labels, received, at, least, 150, signatures, from, other, demographers, and, social, scientists, louis, menand, writer, at, the, new, yorker, stated, that, there, is, no, empirical, basis, for, the, contention, that, differences, within, a, generation, are, smaller, than, differences, between, generations, he, argued, that, generational, theories, seem, to, require, that, people, born, at, the, tail, end, of, one, generation, and, people, born, at, the, beginning, of, another, e, g, a, person, born, in, 1965, the, first, year, of, generation, x, and, a, person, born, in, 1964, the, last, of, the, boomer, era, must, have, different, values, tastes, and, life, experiences, or, that, people, born, in, the, first, and, last, birth, years, of, a, generation, e, g, a, person, born, in, 1980, the, last, year, of, generation, x, and, a, person, born, in, 1965, the, first, year, of, generation, x, have, more, in, common, than, with, people, born, a, couple, years, before, or, after, them, in, 2023, after, a, review, of, their, research, and, methods, and, consulting, with, external, experts, pew, research, center, announced, a, change, in, their, use, of, generation, labels, to, avoid, reinforcing, harmful, stereotypes, or, oversimplifying, people, s, complex, lived, experiences, and, said, that, going, forward, they, will, only, conduct, generational, analysis, when, historical, data, is, available, that, allows, them, to, compare, generations, at, similar, stage, of, life, and, won, t, always, default, to, using, the, standard, generational, definitions, and, labels
