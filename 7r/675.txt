an, ideology, is, a, set, of, beliefs, or, philosophies, attributed, to, a, person, or, group, of, persons, especially, those, held, for, reasons, that, are, not, purely, epistemic, in, which, practical, elements, are, as, prominent, as, theoretical, ones, formerly, applied, primarily, to, economic, political, or, religious, theories, and, policies, in, a, tradition, going, back, to, karl, marx, and, friedrich, engels, more, recent, use, treats, the, term, as, mainly, condemnatory, the, term, was, coined, by, antoine, destutt, de, tracy, a, french, enlightenment, aristocrat, and, philosopher, who, conceived, it, in, 1796, as, the, science, of, ideas, to, develop, a, rational, system, of, ideas, to, oppose, the, irrational, impulses, of, the, mob, in, political, science, the, term, is, used, in, a, descriptive, sense, to, refer, to, political, belief, systems, the, term, ideology, originates, from, french, id, ologie, itself, deriving, from, combining, greek, id, notion, pattern, close, to, the, lockean, sense, of, idea, and, log, the, study, of, the, term, ideology, and, the, system, of, ideas, associated, with, it, was, coined, in, 1796, by, antoine, destutt, de, tracy, while, in, prison, pending, trial, during, the, reign, of, terror, where, he, read, the, works, of, locke, and, tienne, bonnot, de, condillac, hoping, to, form, a, secure, foundation, for, the, moral, and, political, sciences, tracy, devised, the, term, for, a, science, of, ideas, basing, such, upon, two, things, 1, the, sensations, that, people, experience, as, they, interact, with, the, material, world, and, 2, the, ideas, that, form, in, their, minds, due, to, those, sensations, tracy, conceived, ideology, as, a, liberal, philosophy, that, would, defend, individual, liberty, property, free, markets, and, constitutional, limits, on, state, power, he, argues, that, among, these, aspects, ideology, is, the, most, generic, term, because, the, science, of, ideas, also, contains, the, study, of, their, expression, and, deduction, the, coup, d, tat, that, overthrew, maximilien, robespierre, allowed, tracy, to, pursue, his, work, tracy, reacted, to, the, terroristic, phase, of, the, revolution, during, the, napoleonic, regime, as, part, of, the, napoleonic, wars, by, trying, to, work, out, a, rational, system, of, ideas, to, oppose, the, irrational, mob, impulses, that, had, nearly, destroyed, him, a, subsequent, early, source, for, the, near, original, meaning, of, ideology, is, hippolyte, taine, s, work, on, the, ancien, r, gime, origins, of, contemporary, france, i, he, describes, ideology, as, rather, like, teaching, philosophy, via, the, socratic, method, though, without, extending, the, vocabulary, beyond, what, the, general, reader, already, possessed, and, without, the, examples, from, observation, that, practical, science, would, require, taine, identifies, it, not, just, with, tracy, but, also, with, his, milieu, and, includes, condillac, as, one, of, its, precursors, napoleon, bonaparte, came, to, view, ideology, as, a, term, of, abuse, which, he, often, hurled, against, his, liberal, foes, in, tracy, s, institut, national, according, to, karl, mannheim, s, historical, reconstruction, of, the, shifts, in, the, meaning, of, ideology, the, modern, meaning, of, the, word, was, born, when, napoleon, used, it, to, describe, his, opponents, as, the, ideologues, tracy, s, major, book, the, elements, of, ideology, was, soon, translated, into, the, major, languages, of, europe, in, the, century, following, tracy, the, term, ideology, moved, back, and, forth, between, positive, and, negative, connotations, during, this, next, generation, when, post, napoleonic, governments, adopted, a, reactionary, stance, influenced, the, italian, spanish, and, russian, thinkers, who, had, begun, to, describe, themselves, as, liberals, and, who, attempted, to, reignite, revolutionary, activity, in, the, early, 1820s, including, the, carbonari, societies, in, france, and, italy, and, the, decembrists, in, russia, karl, marx, adopted, napoleon, s, negative, sense, of, the, term, using, it, in, his, writings, in, which, he, once, described, tracy, as, a, fischbl, tige, bourgeoisdoktrin, r, a, fish, blooded, bourgeois, doctrinaire, the, term, has, since, dropped, some, of, its, pejorative, sting, euphemism, treadmill, and, has, become, a, neutral, term, in, the, analysis, of, differing, political, opinions, and, views, of, social, groups, while, marx, situated, the, term, within, class, struggle, and, domination, others, believed, it, was, a, necessary, part, of, institutional, functioning, and, social, integration, there, are, many, different, kinds, of, ideologies, including, political, social, epistemological, and, ethical, recent, analysis, tends, to, posit, that, ideology, is, a, coherent, system, of, ideas, that, rely, on, a, few, basic, assumptions, about, reality, that, may, or, may, not, have, any, factual, basis, through, this, system, ideas, become, coherent, repeated, patterns, through, the, subjective, ongoing, choices, that, people, make, these, ideas, serve, as, the, seed, around, which, further, thought, grows, the, belief, in, an, ideology, can, range, from, passive, acceptance, up, to, fervent, advocacy, definitions, such, as, by, manfred, steger, and, paul, james, emphasize, both, the, issue, of, patterning, and, contingent, claims, to, truth, they, wrote, ideologies, are, patterned, clusters, of, normatively, imbued, ideas, and, concepts, including, particular, representations, of, power, relations, these, conceptual, maps, help, people, navigate, the, complexity, of, their, political, universe, and, carry, claims, to, social, truth, studies, of, the, concept, of, ideology, itself, rather, than, specific, ideologies, have, been, carried, out, under, the, name, of, systematic, ideology, in, the, works, of, george, walford, and, harold, walsby, who, attempt, to, explore, the, relationships, between, ideology, and, social, systems, david, w, minar, describes, six, different, ways, the, word, ideology, has, been, used, for, willard, a, mullins, an, ideology, should, be, contrasted, with, the, related, but, different, issues, of, utopia, and, historical, myth, an, ideology, is, composed, of, four, basic, characteristics, terry, eagleton, outlines, more, or, less, in, no, particular, order, some, definitions, of, ideology, german, philosopher, christian, duncker, called, for, a, critical, reflection, of, the, ideology, concept, in, his, work, he, strove, to, bring, the, concept, of, ideology, into, the, foreground, as, well, as, the, closely, connected, concerns, of, epistemology, and, history, defining, ideology, in, terms, of, a, system, of, presentations, that, explicitly, or, implicitly, lay, claim, to, absolute, truth, marx, s, analysis, sees, ideology, as, a, system, of, false, consciousness, that, arises, from, the, economic, relationships, reflecting, and, perpetuating, the, interests, of, the, dominant, class, in, the, marxist, base, and, superstructure, model, of, society, base, denotes, the, relations, of, production, and, modes, of, production, and, superstructure, denotes, the, dominant, ideology, i, e, religious, legal, political, systems, the, economic, base, of, production, determines, the, political, superstructure, of, a, society, ruling, class, interests, determine, the, superstructure, and, the, nature, of, the, justifying, ideology, actions, feasible, because, the, ruling, class, control, the, means, of, production, for, example, in, a, feudal, mode, of, production, religious, ideology, is, the, most, prominent, aspect, of, the, superstructure, while, in, capitalist, formations, ideologies, such, as, liberalism, and, social, democracy, dominate, hence, the, great, importance, of, ideology, justifies, a, society, and, politically, confuses, the, alienated, groups, of, society, via, false, consciousness, some, explanations, have, been, presented, antonio, gramsci, uses, cultural, hegemony, to, explain, why, the, working, class, have, a, false, ideological, conception, of, what, their, best, interests, are, marx, argued, the, class, which, has, the, means, of, material, production, at, its, disposal, has, control, at, the, same, time, over, the, means, of, mental, production, the, marxist, formulation, of, ideology, as, an, instrument, of, social, reproduction, is, conceptually, important, to, the, sociology, of, knowledge, viz, karl, mannheim, daniel, bell, and, j, rgen, habermas, et, al, moreover, mannheim, has, developed, and, progressed, from, the, total, but, special, marxist, conception, of, ideology, to, a, general, and, total, ideological, conception, acknowledging, that, all, ideology, including, marxism, resulted, from, social, life, an, idea, developed, by, the, sociologist, pierre, bourdieu, slavoj, i, ek, and, the, earlier, frankfurt, school, added, to, the, general, theory, of, ideology, a, psychoanalytic, insight, that, ideologies, do, not, include, only, conscious, but, also, unconscious, ideas, french, marxist, philosopher, louis, althusser, proposed, that, ideology, is, the, imagined, existence, or, idea, of, things, as, it, relates, to, the, real, conditions, of, existence, and, makes, use, of, a, lacunar, discourse, a, number, of, propositions, which, are, never, untrue, suggest, a, number, of, other, propositions, which, are, in, this, way, the, essence, of, the, lacunar, discourse, is, what, is, not, told, but, is, suggested, for, example, the, statement, all, are, equal, before, the, law, which, is, a, theoretical, groundwork, of, current, legal, systems, suggests, that, all, people, may, be, of, equal, worth, or, have, equal, opportunities, this, is, not, true, according, to, althusser, for, the, concept, of, private, property, and, power, over, the, means, of, production, results, in, some, people, being, able, to, own, more, than, others, this, power, disparity, contradicts, the, claim, that, all, share, both, practical, worth, and, future, opportunity, equally, for, example, the, rich, can, afford, better, legal, representation, which, practically, privileges, them, before, the, law, althusser, proffered, the, concept, of, the, ideological, state, apparatus, to, explain, his, theory, of, ideology, his, first, thesis, was, ideology, has, no, history, while, individual, ideolog, ies, have, histories, interleaved, with, the, general, class, struggle, of, society, the, general, form, of, ideology, is, external, to, history, for, althusser, beliefs, and, ideas, are, the, products, of, social, practices, not, the, reverse, his, thesis, that, ideas, are, material, is, illustrated, by, the, scandalous, advice, of, pascal, toward, unbelievers, kneel, and, pray, and, then, you, will, believe, what, is, ultimately, ideological, for, althusser, are, not, the, subjective, beliefs, held, in, the, conscious, minds, of, human, individuals, but, rather, discourses, that, produce, these, beliefs, the, material, institutions, and, rituals, that, individuals, take, part, in, without, submitting, it, to, conscious, examination, and, so, much, more, critical, thinking, the, french, marxist, theorist, guy, debord, founding, member, of, the, situationist, international, argued, that, when, the, commodity, becomes, the, essential, category, of, society, i, e, when, the, process, of, commodification, has, been, consummated, to, its, fullest, extent, the, image, of, society, propagated, by, the, commodity, as, it, describes, all, of, life, as, constituted, by, notions, and, objects, deriving, their, value, only, as, commodities, tradeable, in, terms, of, exchange, value, colonizes, all, of, life, and, reduces, society, to, a, mere, representation, the, society, of, the, spectacle, the, american, philosopher, eric, hoffer, identified, several, elements, that, unify, followers, of, a, particular, ideology, ronald, inglehart, of, the, university, of, michigan, is, author, of, the, world, values, survey, which, since, 1980, has, mapped, social, attitudes, in, 100, countries, representing, 90, of, global, population, results, indicate, that, where, people, live, is, likely, to, closely, correlate, with, their, ideological, beliefs, in, much, of, africa, south, asia, and, the, middle, east, people, prefer, traditional, beliefs, and, are, less, tolerant, of, liberal, values, protestant, europe, at, the, other, extreme, adheres, more, to, secular, beliefs, and, liberal, values, alone, among, high, income, countries, the, united, states, is, exceptional, in, its, adherence, to, traditional, beliefs, in, this, case, christianity, in, political, science, a, political, ideology, is, a, certain, ethical, set, of, ideals, principles, doctrines, myths, or, symbols, of, a, social, movement, institution, class, or, large, group, that, explains, how, society, should, work, offering, some, political, and, cultural, blueprint, for, a, certain, social, order, political, ideologies, are, concerned, with, many, different, aspects, of, a, society, including, but, not, limited, to, the, economy, the, government, the, environment, education, health, care, labor, law, criminal, law, the, justice, system, social, security, and, welfare, public, policy, and, administration, foreign, policy, rights, freedoms, and, duties, citizenship, immigration, culture, and, national, identity, military, administration, and, religion, political, ideologies, have, two, dimensions, a, political, ideology, largely, concerns, itself, with, how, to, allocate, power, and, to, what, ends, power, should, be, used, some, parties, follow, a, certain, ideology, very, closely, while, others, may, take, broad, inspiration, from, a, group, of, related, ideologies, without, specifically, embracing, any, one, of, them, each, political, ideology, contains, certain, ideas, on, what, it, considers, the, best, form, of, government, e, g, democracy, demagogy, theocracy, caliphate, etc, scope, of, government, e, g, authoritarianism, libertarianism, federalism, etc, and, the, best, economic, system, e, g, capitalism, socialism, etc, sometimes, the, same, word, is, used, to, identify, both, an, ideology, and, one, of, its, main, ideas, for, instance, socialism, may, refer, to, an, economic, system, or, it, may, refer, to, an, ideology, that, supports, that, economic, system, post, 1991, many, commentators, claim, that, we, are, living, in, a, post, ideological, age, in, which, redemptive, all, encompassing, ideologies, have, failed, this, view, is, often, associated, with, francis, fukuyama, s, writings, on, the, end, of, history, contrastly, nienhueser, 2011, sees, research, in, the, field, of, human, resource, management, as, ongoingly, generating, ideology, there, are, many, proposed, methods, for, the, classification, of, political, ideologies, ideologies, can, identify, themselves, by, their, position, on, the, political, spectrum, e, g, left, center, or, right, they, may, also, be, distinguished, by, single, issues, around, which, they, may, be, built, e, g, civil, libertarianism, support, or, opposition, to, european, integration, legalization, of, marijuana, they, may, also, be, distinguished, by, political, strategies, e, g, populism, personalism, the, classification, of, political, ideology, is, difficult, however, due, to, cultural, relativity, in, definitions, for, example, what, americans, now, call, conservatism, much, of, the, world, calls, liberalism, or, neoliberalism, a, conservatism, in, finland, would, be, labeled, socialism, in, the, united, states, philosopher, michael, oakeshott, defines, single, issue, ideologies, as, the, formalized, abridgment, of, the, supposed, sub, stratum, of, the, rational, truth, contained, in, the, tradition, moreover, charles, blattberg, offers, an, account, that, distinguishes, political, ideologies, from, political, philosophies, slavoj, i, ek, argues, how, the, very, notion, of, post, ideology, can, enable, the, deepest, blindest, form, of, ideology, a, sort, of, false, consciousness, or, false, cynicism, engaged, in, for, the, purpose, of, lending, one, s, point, of, view, the, respect, of, being, objective, pretending, neutral, cynicism, without, truly, being, so, rather, than, help, avoiding, ideology, this, lapse, only, deepens, the, commitment, to, an, existing, one, zizek, calls, this, a, post, modernist, trap, peter, sloterdijk, advanced, the, same, idea, already, in, 1988, studies, have, shown, that, political, ideology, is, somewhat, genetically, heritable, when, a, political, ideology, becomes, a, dominantly, pervasive, component, within, a, government, one, can, speak, of, an, ideocracy, different, forms, of, government, use, ideology, in, various, ways, not, always, restricted, to, politics, and, society, certain, ideas, and, schools, of, thought, become, favored, or, rejected, over, others, depending, on, their, compatibility, with, or, use, for, the, reigning, social, order, in, the, anatomy, of, revolution, crane, brinton, said, that, new, ideology, spreads, when, there, is, discontent, with, an, old, regime, the, may, be, repeated, during, revolutions, itself, extremists, such, as, vladimir, lenin, and, robespierre, may, thus, overcome, more, moderate, revolutionaries, this, stage, is, soon, followed, by, thermidor, a, reining, back, of, revolutionary, enthusiasm, under, pragmatists, like, napoleon, and, joseph, stalin, who, bring, normalcy, and, equilibrium, brinton, s, sequence, men, of, ideas, fanatics, practical, men, of, action, is, reiterated, by, j, william, fulbright, while, a, similar, form, occurs, in, eric, hoffer, s, the, true, believer, the, revolution, thus, becomes, established, as, an, ideocracy, though, its, rise, is, likely, to, be, checked, by, a, political, midlife, crisis, even, when, the, challenging, of, existing, beliefs, is, encouraged, as, in, scientific, theories, the, dominant, paradigm, or, mindset, can, prevent, certain, challenges, theories, or, experiments, from, being, advanced, a, special, case, of, science, that, has, inspired, ideology, is, ecology, which, studies, the, relationships, among, living, things, on, earth, perceptual, psychologist, james, j, gibson, believed, that, human, perception, of, ecological, relationships, was, the, basis, of, self, awareness, and, cognition, itself, linguist, george, lakoff, has, proposed, a, cognitive, science, of, mathematics, wherein, even, the, most, fundamental, ideas, of, arithmetic, would, be, seen, as, consequences, or, products, of, human, perception, which, is, itself, necessarily, evolved, within, an, ecology, deep, ecology, and, the, modern, ecology, movement, and, to, a, lesser, degree, green, parties, appear, to, have, adopted, ecological, sciences, as, a, positive, ideology, some, notable, economically, based, ideologies, include, neoliberalism, monetarism, mercantilism, mixed, economy, social, darwinism, communism, laissez, faire, economics, and, free, trade, there, are, also, current, theories, of, safe, trade, and, fair, trade, that, can, be, seen, as, ideologies, a, large, amount, of, research, in, psychology, is, concerned, with, the, causes, consequences, and, content, of, ideology, with, humans, being, dubbed, the, ideological, animal, by, althusser, 269, many, theories, have, tried, to, explain, the, existence, of, ideology, in, human, societies, 269, jost, ledgerwood, and, hardin, 2008, propose, that, ideologies, may, function, as, prepackaged, units, of, interpretation, that, spread, because, of, basic, human, motives, to, understand, the, world, avoid, existential, threat, and, maintain, valued, interpersonal, relationships, the, authors, conclude, that, such, motives, may, lead, disproportionately, to, the, adoption, of, system, justifying, worldviews, psychologists, generally, agree, that, personality, traits, individual, difference, variables, needs, and, ideological, beliefs, seem, to, have, something, in, common, just, world, theory, posits, that, people, want, to, believe, in, a, fair, world, for, a, sense, of, control, and, security, and, generate, ideologies, in, order, to, maintain, this, belief, for, example, by, justifiying, inequality, or, unfortunate, events, a, critique, of, just, world, theory, as, a, sole, explanation, of, ideology, is, that, it, does, not, explain, the, differences, between, ideologies, 270, 271, terror, management, theory, posits, that, ideology, is, used, as, a, defence, mechanism, against, threats, to, their, worldview, which, in, turn, protect, and, individuals, sense, of, self, esteem, and, reduce, their, awareness, of, mortality, evidence, shows, that, priming, individuals, with, an, awareness, of, mortality, does, not, cause, individuals, to, respond, in, ways, underpinned, by, any, particular, ideology, but, rather, the, ideology, that, they, are, currently, aware, of, 271, system, justification, theory, posits, that, people, tend, to, defend, existing, society, even, at, times, against, their, interest, which, in, turn, causes, people, to, create, ideological, explanations, to, justify, the, status, quo, jost, fitzimmons, and, kay, argue, that, the, motivation, to, protect, a, preexisting, system, is, due, to, a, desire, for, cognitive, consistency, being, able, to, think, in, similar, ways, over, time, reducing, uncertainty, and, reducing, effort, illusion, of, control, and, fear, of, equality, 272, according, to, system, justification, theory, ideologies, reflect, unconscious, motivational, processes, as, opposed, to, the, view, that, political, convictions, always, reflect, independent, and, unbiased, thinking, according, to, semiotician, bob, hodge, identifies, a, unitary, object, that, incorporates, complex, sets, of, meanings, with, the, social, agents, and, processes, that, produced, them, no, other, term, captures, this, object, as, well, as, ideology, foucault, s, episteme, is, too, narrow, and, abstract, not, social, enough, his, discourse, popular, because, it, covers, some, of, ideology, s, terrain, with, less, baggage, is, too, confined, to, verbal, systems, worldview, is, too, metaphysical, propaganda, too, loaded, despite, or, because, of, its, contradictions, ideology, still, plays, a, key, role, in, semiotics, oriented, to, social, political, life, authors, such, as, michael, freeden, have, also, recently, incorporated, a, semantic, analysis, to, the, study, of, ideologies, sociologists, define, ideology, as, cultural, beliefs, that, justify, particular, social, arrangements, including, patterns, of, inequality, dominant, groups, use, these, sets, of, cultural, beliefs, and, practices, to, justify, the, systems, of, inequality, that, maintain, their, group, s, social, power, over, non, dominant, groups, ideologies, use, a, society, s, symbol, system, to, organize, social, relations, in, a, hierarchy, with, some, social, identities, being, superior, to, other, social, identities, which, are, considered, inferior, the, dominant, ideology, in, a, society, is, passed, along, through, the, society, s, major, social, institutions, such, as, the, media, the, family, education, and, religion, as, societies, changed, throughout, history, so, did, the, ideologies, that, justified, systems, of, inequality, sociological, examples, of, ideologies, include, racism, sexism, heterosexism, ableism, and, ethnocentrism
