classical, arabic, or, quranic, arabic, arabic, romanized, al, arab, yah, al, fu, lit, the, most, eloquent, classic, arabic, is, the, standardized, literary, form, of, arabic, used, from, the, 7th, century, and, throughout, the, middle, ages, most, notably, in, umayyad, and, abbasid, literary, texts, such, as, poetry, elevated, prose, and, oratory, and, is, also, the, liturgical, language, of, islam, classical, arabic, is, furthermore, the, register, of, the, arabic, language, on, which, modern, standard, arabic, is, based, several, written, grammars, of, classical, arabic, were, published, with, the, exegesis, of, arabic, grammar, being, at, times, based, on, the, existing, texts, and, the, works, of, previous, texts, in, addition, to, various, early, sources, considered, to, be, of, most, venerated, genesis, of, arabic, the, primary, focus, of, such, works, was, to, facilitate, different, linguistic, aspects, modern, standard, arabic, is, its, direct, descendant, used, today, throughout, the, arab, world, in, writing, and, in, formal, speaking, for, example, prepared, speeches, some, radio, and, television, broadcasts, and, non, entertainment, content, the, lexis, and, stylistics, of, modern, standard, arabic, are, different, from, classical, arabic, and, modern, standard, arabic, uses, a, subset, of, the, syntactic, structures, available, in, classical, arabic, but, the, morphology, and, syntax, have, remained, basically, unchanged, in, the, arab, world, little, distinction, is, made, between, classical, arabic, and, modern, standard, arabic, and, both, are, normally, called, al, fu, in, arabic, meaning, the, most, eloquent, the, earliest, forms, of, arabic, are, known, as, old, arabic, and, survive, in, inscriptions, in, ancient, north, arabian, scripts, as, well, as, fragments, of, pre, islamic, poetry, preserved, in, the, classical, literature, it, is, hypothesized, that, by, the, late, 6th, century, ad, a, relatively, uniform, intertribal, poetic, koin, a, synthetic, language, distinct, from, the, spoken, vernaculars, had, developed, with, conservative, as, well, as, innovative, features, including, the, case, endings, known, as, i, rab, it, is, uncertain, to, what, degree, the, spoken, vernaculars, corresponded, to, the, literary, style, however, as, many, surviving, inscriptions, in, the, region, seem, to, indicate, simplification, or, absence, of, the, inflectional, morphology, of, classical, arabic, it, is, often, said, that, the, bedouin, dialects, of, najd, were, probably, the, most, conservative, or, at, least, resembled, the, elevated, intertribal, idiom, morphologically, and, lexically, more, than, the, other, contemporary, vernaculars, a, view, possibly, supported, by, the, romanticization, of, the, purity, of, the, language, of, the, desert, dwellers, as, opposed, to, the, corrupted, dialects, of, the, city, dwellers, expressed, in, many, medieval, arabic, works, especially, those, on, grammar, though, some, argue, that, all, the, spoken, vernaculars, probably, deviated, greatly, from, the, supraregional, literary, norm, to, different, degrees, while, others, such, as, joshua, blau, believe, that, the, differences, between, the, classical, and, spoken, language, were, not, too, far, reaching, the, arabic, script, is, generally, believed, to, have, evolved, from, local, cursive, varieties, of, the, aramaic, script, which, have, been, adopted, to, write, arabic, though, some, such, as, jean, starcky, have, postulated, that, it, instead, derives, direct, from, the, syriac, script, since, unlike, aramaic, the, scripts, of, arabic, and, syriac, are, both, cursive, indigenous, speculations, concerning, the, history, of, the, script, sometimes, ascribe, the, origins, of, the, script, and, oftentimes, the, language, itself, also, to, one, of, the, ancient, major, figures, in, islam, such, as, adam, or, ishmael, though, others, mention, that, it, was, introduced, to, arabia, from, afar, in, the, 7th, century, ad, the, distinctive, features, of, old, hijazi, such, as, loss, of, final, short, vowels, loss, of, hamza, lenition, of, final, at, to, ah, and, lack, of, nunation, influenced, the, consonantal, text, or, rasm, of, the, qur, an, and, also, many, of, its, readings, also, and, the, later, normalized, orthography, of, classical, arabic, as, a, standard, literary, register, in, the, 8th, century, by, the, 2nd, century, ah, 9th, century, ad, ce, the, language, had, been, standardized, by, arabic, grammarians, and, knowledge, of, classical, arabic, became, a, prerequisite, for, rising, into, the, higher, classes, throughout, the, islamic, world, since, it, was, the, lingua, franca, across, the, middle, east, north, africa, and, the, horn, of, africa, and, thus, the, region, eventually, developed, into, a, widespread, state, of, diglossia, consequently, the, classical, language, as, well, as, the, arabic, script, became, the, subject, of, much, mythicization, and, was, eventually, associated, with, religious, ethnic, and, racial, conflicts, such, as, the, rise, of, many, groups, traditionally, categorized, under, the, broad, label, of, al, shu, ibiyya, roughly, meaning, those, of, the, nations, as, opposed, to, arab, tribes, who, despite, the, remarkable, differences, in, their, views, generally, rejected, the, stressed, and, often, dogmatized, belief, that, the, arabs, as, well, as, their, language, were, far, superior, to, all, other, races, and, ethnicities, and, so, the, term, later, came, to, be, applied, pejoratively, to, such, groups, by, their, rivals, moreover, many, arabic, grammarians, strove, to, attribute, as, many, words, as, possible, to, a, pure, arabic, origin, especially, those, in, the, qur, an, thus, exegetes, theologians, and, grammarians, who, entertained, the, idea, of, the, presence, of, impurities, for, example, naturalized, loanwords, in, the, qur, an, were, severely, criticized, and, their, proposed, etymologies, denounced, in, most, cases, nonetheless, the, belief, in, the, racial, and, ethnic, supremacy, of, the, arabs, and, the, belief, in, the, linguistic, supremacy, of, arabic, did, not, seem, to, be, necessary, entailments, of, each, other, poems, and, sayings, attributed, to, arabic, speaking, personages, who, lived, before, the, standardization, of, the, classical, idiom, which, are, preserved, mainly, in, far, later, manuscripts, contain, traces, of, elements, in, morphology, and, syntax, that, began, to, be, regarded, as, chiefly, poetic, or, characteristically, regional, or, dialectal, despite, this, these, along, with, the, qur, an, were, perceived, as, the, principal, foundation, upon, which, grammatical, inquiry, theorizing, and, reasoning, were, to, be, based, they, also, formed, the, literary, ideal, to, be, followed, quoted, and, imitated, in, solemn, texts, and, speeches, lexically, classical, arabic, may, retain, one, or, more, of, the, dialectal, forms, of, a, given, word, as, variants, of, the, standardized, forms, albeit, often, with, much, less, currency, and, use, various, arabic, dialects, freely, borrowed, words, from, classical, arabic, a, situation, similar, to, the, romance, languages, wherein, scores, of, words, were, borrowed, directly, from, classical, latin, arabic, speakers, usually, spoke, classical, arabic, as, a, second, language, if, they, spoke, the, colloquial, dialects, as, their, first, language, or, as, a, third, language, if, they, spoke, another, language, as, their, first, language, and, a, regional, variety, of, colloquial, arabic, as, their, second, language, nonetheless, the, pronunciation, of, classical, arabic, was, likely, influenced, by, the, vernaculars, to, different, degrees, much, like, modern, standard, arabic, the, differences, in, pronunciation, and, vocabulary, in, the, regional, arabic, varieties, were, in, turn, variously, influenced, by, the, native, languages, spoken, in, the, conquered, regions, such, as, coptic, in, egypt, berber, and, punic, in, the, maghreb, himyaritic, modern, south, arabian, and, old, south, arabian, in, yemen, and, aramaic, in, the, levant, like, modern, standard, arabic, classical, arabic, had, 28, consonant, phonemes, notes, the, a1, inscription, dated, to, the, 3rd, or, 4th, century, ad, in, the, greek, alphabet, in, a, dialect, showing, affinities, to, that, of, the, safaitic, inscriptions, shows, that, short, final, high, vowels, had, been, lost, in, at, least, some, dialects, of, old, arabic, at, that, time, obliterating, the, distinction, between, nominative, and, genitive, case, in, the, singular, leaving, the, accusative, the, only, marked, case, classical, arabic, however, shows, a, far, more, archaic, system, essentially, identical, with, that, of, proto, arabic, the, definite, article, spread, areally, among, the, central, semitic, languages, and, it, would, seem, that, proto, arabic, lacked, any, overt, marking, of, definiteness, besides, dialects, with, no, definite, article, the, safaitic, inscriptions, exhibit, about, four, different, article, forms, ordered, by, frequency, h, l, and, hn, the, old, arabic, of, the, nabataean, inscriptions, exhibits, almost, exclusively, the, form, l, unlike, the, classical, arabic, article, the, old, arabic, l, almost, never, exhibits, the, assimilation, of, the, coda, to, the, coronals, the, same, situation, is, attested, in, the, graeco, arabica, but, in, a1, the, coda, assimilates, to, the, following, d, ad, dawra, the, region, in, classical, arabic, the, definite, article, takes, the, form, al, with, the, coda, of, the, article, exhibiting, assimilation, to, the, following, dental, and, denti, alveolar, consonants, note, the, inclusion, of, palatal, which, alone, among, the, palatal, consonants, exhibits, assimilation, indicating, that, assimilation, ceased, to, be, productive, before, that, consonant, shifted, from, old, arabic, proto, central, semitic, proto, arabic, various, forms, of, old, arabic, and, some, modern, najdi, dialects, to, this, day, have, alternation, in, the, performative, vowel, of, the, prefix, conjugation, depending, on, the, stem, vowel, of, the, verb, early, forms, of, classical, arabic, allowed, this, alternation, but, later, forms, of, classical, arabic, levelled, the, a, allomorph
