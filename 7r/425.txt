assamese, or, asamiya, is, an, indo, aryan, language, spoken, mainly, in, the, north, eastern, indian, state, of, assam, where, it, is, an, official, language, it, serves, as, a, lingua, franca, of, the, wider, region, and, has, over, 15, million, native, speakers, according, to, ethnologue, nefamese, an, assamese, based, pidgin, in, arunachal, pradesh, was, used, as, the, lingua, franca, till, it, was, replaced, by, hindi, and, nagamese, an, assamese, based, creole, language, continues, to, be, widely, used, in, nagaland, the, kamtapuri, language, of, rangpur, division, of, bangladesh, and, the, cooch, behar, and, jalpaiguri, districts, of, india, is, linguistically, closer, to, assamese, though, the, speakers, identify, with, the, bengali, culture, and, the, literary, language, in, the, past, it, was, the, court, language, of, the, ahom, kingdom, from, the, 17th, century, along, with, other, eastern, indo, aryan, languages, assamese, evolved, at, least, before, the, 7th, century, ce, from, the, middle, indo, aryan, magadhi, prakrit, its, sister, languages, include, angika, bengali, bishnupriya, manipuri, chakma, chittagonian, hajong, rajbangsi, maithili, rohingya, and, sylheti, it, is, written, in, the, assamese, alphabet, an, abugida, system, from, left, to, right, with, many, typographic, ligatures, assamese, originated, in, old, indo, aryan, dialects, though, the, exact, nature, of, its, origin, and, growth, is, not, clear, yet, it, is, generally, believed, that, assamese, and, the, kamatapuri, lects, derive, from, the, kamarupi, dialect, of, eastern, magadhi, prakrit, though, some, authors, contest, a, close, connection, of, assamese, with, magadhi, prakrit, the, indo, aryan, which, appeared, in, the, 4th, 5th, century, in, assam, was, probably, spoken, in, the, new, settlements, of, kamarupa, in, urban, centers, and, along, the, brahmaputra, river, surrounded, by, tibeto, burman, and, austroasiatic, communities, kakati, s, 1941, assertion, that, assamese, has, an, austroasiatic, substrate, is, generally, assumed, which, suggests, that, when, the, indo, aryan, centers, formed, in, the, 4th, 5th, centuries, ce, there, were, substantial, austroasiatic, speakers, that, later, accepted, the, indo, aryan, vernacular, based, on, the, 7th, century, chinese, traveller, xuanzang, s, observations, chatterji, 1926, suggests, that, the, indo, aryan, vernacular, differentiated, itself, in, kamarupa, before, it, did, in, bengal, and, that, these, differences, could, be, attributed, to, non, indo, aryan, speakers, adopting, the, language, the, newly, differentiated, vernacular, from, which, assamese, eventually, emerged, is, evident, in, the, prakritisms, present, in, the, sanskrit, of, the, kamarupa, inscriptions, the, earliest, forms, of, assamese, in, literature, are, found, in, the, 9th, century, buddhist, verses, called, charyapada, the, language, of, which, bear, affinities, with, assamese, as, well, as, bengali, maithili, and, odia, and, which, belongs, to, a, period, when, the, prakrit, was, at, the, cusp, of, differentiating, into, regional, languages, the, spirit, and, expressiveness, of, the, charyadas, are, today, found, in, the, folk, songs, called, deh, bicarar, git, in, the, 12th, 14th, century, works, of, ramai, pundit, sunya, puran, boru, chandidas, krishna, kirtan, sukur, mamud, gopichandrar, gan, durllava, mullik, gobindachandrar, git, and, bhavani, das, mainamatir, gan, assamese, grammatical, peculiarities, coexist, with, features, from, bengali, language, though, the, gauda, kamarupa, stage, is, generally, accepted, and, partially, supported, by, recent, linguistic, research, it, has, not, been, fully, reconstructed, a, distinctly, assamese, literary, form, appeared, first, in, the, 13th, century, in, the, courts, of, the, kamata, kingdom, when, hema, sarasvati, composed, the, poem, prahr, da, carita, in, the, 14th, century, madhava, kandali, translated, the, ramayana, into, assamese, saptakanda, ramayana, in, the, court, of, mahamanikya, a, kachari, king, from, central, assam, though, the, assamese, idiom, in, these, works, is, fully, individualised, some, archaic, forms, and, conjunctive, particles, too, are, found, this, period, corresponds, to, the, common, stage, of, proto, kamta, and, early, assamese, the, emergence, of, sankardev, s, ekasarana, dharma, in, the, 15th, century, triggered, a, revival, in, language, and, literature, sankardev, produced, many, translated, works, and, created, new, literary, forms, borgeets, songs, ankia, naat, one, act, plays, infusing, them, with, brajavali, idioms, and, these, were, sustained, by, his, followers, madhavdev, and, others, in, the, 15th, and, subsequent, centuries, in, these, writings, the, 13th, 14th, century, archaic, forms, are, no, longer, found, sankardev, pioneered, a, prose, style, of, writing, in, the, ankia, naat, this, was, further, developed, by, bhattadeva, who, translated, the, bhagavata, purana, and, bhagavad, gita, into, assamese, prose, bhattadev, s, prose, was, classical, and, restrained, with, a, high, usage, of, sanskrit, forms, and, expressions, in, an, assamese, syntax, and, though, subsequent, authors, tried, to, follow, this, style, it, soon, fell, into, disuse, in, this, writing, the, first, person, future, tense, ending, m, korim, will, do, kham, will, eat, is, seen, for, the, first, time, the, language, moved, to, the, court, of, the, ahom, kingdom, in, the, seventeenth, century, where, it, became, the, state, language, in, parallel, the, proselytising, ekasarana, dharma, converted, many, bodo, kachari, peoples, and, there, emerged, many, new, assamese, speakers, who, were, speakers, of, tibeto, burman, languages, this, period, saw, the, emergence, of, different, styles, of, secular, prose, in, medicine, astrology, arithmetic, dance, music, besides, religious, biographies, and, the, archaic, prose, of, magical, charms, most, importantly, this, was, also, when, assamese, developed, a, standardised, prose, in, the, buranjis, documents, related, to, the, ahom, state, dealing, with, diplomatic, writings, administrative, records, and, general, history, the, language, of, the, buranjis, is, nearly, modern, with, some, minor, differences, in, grammar, and, with, a, pre, modern, orthography, the, assamese, plural, suffixes, bor, hat, and, the, conjunctive, participles, gai, dharile, gai, hi, pale, hi, baril, hi, become, well, established, the, buranjis, dealing, with, statecraft, was, also, the, vehicle, by, which, arabic, and, persian, elements, crept, into, the, language, in, abundance, due, to, the, influence, of, the, ahom, state, the, speech, in, eastern, assam, took, a, homogeneous, and, standard, form, the, general, schwa, deletion, that, occurs, in, the, final, position, of, words, came, into, use, in, this, period, the, modern, period, of, assamese, begins, with, printing, the, publication, of, the, assamese, bible, in, 1813, from, the, serampore, mission, press, but, after, the, british, east, india, company, eic, removed, the, burmese, in, 1826, and, took, complete, administrative, control, of, assam, in, 1836, it, filled, administrative, positions, with, people, from, bengal, and, introduced, bengali, language, in, its, offices, schools, and, courts, the, eic, had, earlier, promoted, the, development, of, bengali, to, replace, persian, the, language, of, administration, in, mughal, india, and, maintained, that, assamese, was, a, dialect, of, bengali, amidst, this, loss, of, status, the, american, baptist, mission, abm, established, a, press, in, sibsagar, in, 1846, leading, to, publications, of, an, assamese, periodical, orunodoi, the, first, assamese, grammar, by, nathan, brown, 1846, and, the, first, assamese, english, dictionary, by, miles, bronson, 1863, the, abm, argued, strongly, with, the, eic, officials, in, an, intense, debate, in, the, 1850s, to, reinstate, assamese, among, the, local, personalities, anandaram, dhekial, phukan, drew, up, an, extensive, catalogue, of, medieval, assamese, literature, among, other, works, and, pioneered, the, effort, among, the, natives, to, reinstate, assamese, in, assam, though, this, effort, was, not, immediately, successful, the, administration, eventually, declared, assamese, the, official, vernacular, in, 1873, on, the, eve, of, assam, becoming, a, chief, commissioner, s, province, in, 1874, in, the, extant, medieval, assamese, manuscripts, the, orthography, was, not, uniform, the, abm, had, evolved, a, phonemic, orthography, based, on, a, contracted, set, of, characters, working, independently, hemchandra, barua, provided, an, etymological, orthography, and, his, etymological, dictionary, hemkosh, was, published, posthumously, he, also, provided, a, sanskritised, approach, to, the, language, in, his, asamiya, bhaxar, byakaran, grammar, of, the, assamese, language, 1859, 1873, barua, s, approach, was, adopted, by, the, asamiya, bhasa, unnati, sadhini, sabha, 1888, assamese, language, development, society, that, emerged, in, kolkata, among, assamese, students, led, by, lakshminath, bezbaroa, the, society, published, a, periodical, jonaki, and, the, period, of, its, publication, jonaki, era, saw, spirited, negotiations, on, language, standardisation, what, emerged, at, the, end, of, those, negotiations, was, a, standard, close, to, the, language, of, the, buranjis, with, the, sanskritised, orthography, of, hemchandra, barua, as, the, political, and, commercial, center, moved, to, guwahati, in, the, mid, twentieth, century, of, which, dispur, the, capital, of, assam, is, a, suburb, and, which, is, situated, at, the, border, between, the, western, and, central, dialect, speaking, regions, standard, assamese, used, in, media, and, communications, today, is, a, neutral, blend, of, the, eastern, variety, without, its, distinctive, features, this, core, is, further, embellished, with, goalpariya, and, kamrupi, idioms, and, forms, assamese, is, native, to, assam, it, is, also, spoken, in, states, of, arunachal, pradesh, meghalaya, and, nagaland, the, assamese, script, can, be, found, in, of, present, day, burma, the, pashupatinath, temple, in, nepal, also, has, inscriptions, in, assamese, showing, its, influence, in, the, past, there, is, a, significant, assamese, speaking, diaspora, worldwide, assamese, is, the, official, language, of, assam, and, one, of, the, 22, official, languages, recognised, by, the, republic, of, india, the, assam, secretariat, functions, in, assamese, the, assamese, phonemic, inventory, consists, of, eight, vowels, ten, diphthongs, and, twenty, three, consonants, including, two, semivowels, the, assamese, phoneme, inventory, is, unique, in, the, group, of, indo, aryan, languages, as, it, lacks, a, dental, retroflex, distinction, among, the, coronal, stops, as, well, as, the, lack, of, postalveolar, affricates, and, fricatives, historically, the, dental, and, retroflex, series, merged, into, alveolar, stops, this, makes, assamese, resemble, non, indic, languages, of, northeast, india, such, as, austroasiatic, and, sino, tibetan, languages, the, only, other, language, to, have, fronted, retroflex, stops, into, alveolars, is, the, closely, related, group, of, eastern, dialects, of, bengali, although, a, contrast, with, dental, stops, remains, in, those, dialects, r, is, normally, realised, as, or, assamese, is, unusual, among, eastern, indo, aryan, languages, for, the, presence, of, x, realised, as, or, depending, on, the, speaker, and, speech, register, due, historically, to, the, mia, sibilants, lenition, to, x, initially, and, h, non, initially, the, use, of, the, voiceless, velar, fricative, is, heavy, in, the, eastern, assamese, dialects, and, decreases, progressively, to, the, west, from, kamrupi, to, eastern, goalparia, and, disappears, completely, in, western, goalpariya, the, change, of, s, to, h, and, then, to, x, has, been, attributed, to, tibeto, burman, influence, by, suniti, kumar, chatterjee, assamese, odia, and, bengali, in, contrast, to, other, indo, aryan, languages, use, the, velar, nasal, the, english, ng, in, sing, extensively, while, in, many, languages, the, velar, nasal, is, commonly, restricted, to, preceding, velar, sounds, in, assamese, it, can, occur, intervocalically, this, is, another, feature, it, shares, with, other, languages, of, northeast, india, though, in, assamese, the, velar, nasal, never, occurs, word, initially, eastern, indic, languages, like, assamese, bengali, sylheti, and, odia, do, not, have, a, vowel, length, distinction, but, have, a, wide, set, of, back, rounded, vowels, in, the, case, of, assamese, there, are, four, back, rounded, vowels, that, contrast, phonemically, as, demonstrated, by, the, minimal, set, kola, deaf, k, la, black, kwla, lap, and, kula, winnowing, fan, the, near, close, near, back, rounded, vowel, is, unique, in, this, branch, of, the, language, family, but, in, lower, assam, is, pronounced, the, same, as, compare, kwla, and, mwr, assamese, has, vowel, harmony, the, vowels, and, cause, the, preceding, mid, vowels, and, the, high, back, vowels, to, change, to, and, and, respectively, assamese, is, one, of, the, few, languages, spoken, in, india, which, exhibit, a, systematic, process, of, vowel, harmony, the, inherent, vowel, in, standard, assamese, follows, deletion, rules, analogous, to, schwa, deletion, in, other, indian, languages, assamese, follows, a, slightly, different, set, of, schwa, deletion, rules, for, its, modern, standard, and, early, varieties, in, the, modern, standard, is, generally, deleted, in, the, final, position, unless, it, is, 1, w, or, 2, y, after, higher, vowels, like, i, or, u, though, there, are, a, few, additional, exceptions, the, rule, for, deleting, the, final, was, not, followed, in, early, assamese, the, initial, is, never, deleted, modern, assamese, uses, the, assamese, script, in, medieval, times, the, script, came, in, three, varieties, bamuniya, garhgaya, and, kaitheli, lakhari, which, developed, from, the, kamarupi, script, it, very, closely, resembles, the, mithilakshar, script, of, the, maithili, language, as, well, as, the, bengali, script, there, is, a, strong, literary, tradition, from, early, times, examples, can, be, seen, in, edicts, land, grants, and, copper, plates, of, medieval, kings, assam, had, its, own, manuscript, writing, system, on, the, bark, of, the, saanchi, tree, in, which, religious, texts, and, chronicles, were, written, as, opposed, to, the, pan, indian, system, of, palm, leaf, manuscript, writing, the, present, day, spellings, in,
