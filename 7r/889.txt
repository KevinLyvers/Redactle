genocide, is, violence, that, targets, individuals, because, of, their, membership, of, a, group, and, aims, at, the, destruction, of, a, people, raphael, lemkin, who, first, coined, the, term, defined, genocide, as, the, destruction, of, a, nation, or, of, an, ethnic, group, by, means, such, as, the, disintegration, of, political, and, social, institutions, of, culture, language, national, feelings, religion, and, economic, existence, during, the, struggle, to, ratify, the, genocide, convention, powerful, countries, restricted, lemkin, s, definition, to, exclude, their, own, actions, from, being, classified, as, genocide, ultimately, limiting, it, to, any, of, five, acts, committed, with, intent, to, destroy, in, whole, or, in, part, a, national, ethnical, racial, or, religious, group, genocide, has, occurred, throughout, human, history, even, during, prehistoric, times, but, is, particularly, likely, in, situations, of, imperial, expansion, and, power, consolidation, therefore, it, is, associated, with, colonial, empires, and, settler, colonies, as, well, as, with, both, world, wars, and, repressive, governments, in, the, twentieth, century, the, colloquial, understanding, of, genocide, is, heavily, influenced, by, the, holocaust, as, its, archetype, and, is, conceived, as, innocent, victims, targeted, for, their, ethnic, identity, rather, than, for, any, political, reason, genocide, is, widely, considered, to, be, the, epitome, of, human, evil, and, often, referred, to, as, the, crime, of, crimes, consequently, events, are, often, denounced, as, genocide, polish, jewish, lawyer, raphael, lemkin, coined, the, term, genocide, between, 1941, and, 1943, lemkin, s, coinage, combined, the, greek, word, genos, race, people, with, the, latin, suffix, caedo, act, of, killing, he, submitted, the, manuscript, for, his, book, axis, rule, in, occupied, europe, to, the, publisher, in, early, 1942, and, it, was, published, in, 1944, as, the, holocaust, was, coming, to, light, outside, europe, lemkin, s, proposal, was, more, ambitious, than, simply, outlawing, this, type, of, mass, slaughter, he, also, thought, that, the, law, against, genocide, could, promote, more, tolerant, and, pluralistic, societies, according, to, lemkin, the, central, definition, of, genocide, was, the, destruction, of, a, nation, or, of, an, ethnic, group, in, which, its, members, were, not, targeted, as, individuals, but, rather, as, members, of, the, group, the, objectives, of, genocide, would, be, the, disintegration, of, the, political, and, social, institutions, of, culture, language, national, feelings, religion, and, the, economic, existence, of, national, groups, these, were, not, separate, crimes, but, different, aspects, of, the, same, genocidal, process, lemkin, s, definition, of, nation, was, sufficiently, broad, to, apply, to, nearly, any, type, of, human, collectivity, even, one, based, on, a, trivial, characteristic, he, saw, genocide, as, an, inherently, colonial, process, and, in, his, later, writings, analyzed, what, he, described, as, the, colonial, genocides, occurring, within, european, overseas, territories, as, well, as, the, soviet, and, nazi, empires, furthermore, his, definition, of, genocidal, acts, which, was, to, replace, the, national, pattern, of, the, victim, with, that, of, the, perpetrator, was, much, broader, than, the, five, types, enumerated, in, the, genocide, convention, lemkin, considered, genocide, to, have, occurred, since, the, beginning, of, human, history, and, dated, the, efforts, to, criminalize, it, to, the, spanish, critics, of, colonial, excesses, francisco, de, vitoria, and, bartolom, de, las, casas, the, 1946, judgement, against, arthur, greiser, issued, by, a, polish, court, was, the, first, legal, verdict, that, mentioned, the, term, using, lemkin, s, original, definition, according, to, the, legal, instrument, used, to, prosecute, defeated, german, leaders, at, the, international, military, tribunal, at, nuremberg, atrocity, crimes, were, only, prosecutable, by, international, justice, if, they, were, committed, as, part, of, an, illegal, war, of, aggression, the, powers, prosecuting, the, trial, were, unwilling, to, restrict, a, government, s, actions, against, its, own, citizens, in, order, to, criminalize, peacetime, genocide, lemkin, brought, his, proposal, to, criminalize, genocide, to, the, newly, established, united, nations, in, 1946, he, approached, the, african, delegations, first, in, an, attempt, to, build, a, coalition, of, smaller, states, and, former, colonies, that, had, themselves, recently, experienced, genocide, lemkin, hoped, that, at, this, point, the, major, powers, the, united, states, united, kingdom, and, soviet, union, would, step, in, and, take, credit, for, passing, the, convention, opposition, to, the, convention, was, greater, than, lemkin, expected, due, to, various, countries, and, not, just, great, powers, concerned, that, it, would, lead, their, own, policies, including, treatment, of, indigenous, peoples, european, colonialism, racial, segregation, in, the, united, states, and, soviet, nationalities, policy, to, be, labeled, genocide, before, the, convention, was, passed, powerful, countries, both, western, powers, and, the, soviet, union, secured, changes, in, an, attempt, to, make, the, convention, unenforceable, and, applicable, to, their, geopolitical, rivals, actions, but, not, their, own, the, result, gutted, lemkin, s, original, intentions, he, privately, considered, it, a, failure, over, the, course, of, these, revisions, lemkin, s, anti, colonial, conception, of, genocide, was, transformed, into, one, acceptable, to, colonial, powers, among, the, violence, freed, from, the, stigma, of, genocide, included, the, same, actions, targeting, political, groups, which, the, soviet, union, is, particularly, blamed, for, blocking, although, lemkin, credited, women, s, ngos, with, securing, the, passage, of, the, convention, the, gendered, violence, of, forced, pregnancy, marriage, and, divorce, was, left, out, additionally, omitted, was, forced, migration, of, populations, which, had, been, recently, carried, out, by, the, soviet, union, and, its, satellites, condoned, by, the, western, allies, against, millions, of, germans, from, central, and, eastern, europe, on, 9, december, 1948, the, un, general, assembly, adopted, the, convention, on, the, prevention, and, punishment, of, the, crime, of, genocide, cppcg, it, came, into, effect, on, 12, january, 1951, after, 20, countries, ratified, it, without, reservations, the, convention, s, definition, of, genocide, was, adopted, verbatim, by, the, ad, hoc, international, criminal, tribunals, and, by, the, rome, statute, that, established, the, international, criminal, court, icc, genocide, is, defined, as, any, of, the, following, acts, committed, with, intent, to, destroy, in, whole, or, in, part, a, national, ethnical, racial, or, religious, group, as, such, in, addition, attempted, genocide, conspiracy, to, commit, genocide, incitement, to, genocide, and, complicity, in, genocide, are, criminalized, the, convention, does, not, allow, the, retroactive, prosecution, of, events, that, took, place, prior, to, 1951, many, countries, have, incorporated, genocide, into, their, municipal, law, varying, to, a, lesser, or, greater, extent, from, the, convention, a, specific, intent, to, destroy, is, the, mens, rea, requirement, of, genocide, the, issue, of, what, it, means, to, destroy, a, group, as, such, and, how, to, prove, the, required, intent, has, been, difficult, for, courts, to, resolve, the, legal, system, has, also, struggled, with, how, much, of, a, group, can, be, targeted, before, triggering, the, genocide, convention, the, two, main, approaches, to, intent, are, the, purposive, approach, where, the, perpetrator, specifically, intends, to, commit, genocide, and, the, knowledge, based, approach, where, the, perpetrator, understands, that, genocidal, outcomes, will, result, from, his, actions, perpetrators, do, not, always, make, their, intentions, clear, in, public, statements, although, courts, sometimes, ascribe, intent, based, on, other, factors, perpetrators, often, take, advantage, of, the, legal, special, intent, requirement, to, claim, that, they, merely, sought, the, removal, of, the, group, from, a, given, territory, instead, of, destruction, as, such, or, that, the, genocidal, actions, were, collateral, damage, of, military, activity, during, the, cold, war, genocide, remained, at, the, level, of, rhetoric, because, both, superpowers, the, united, states, and, the, soviet, union, felt, vulnerable, to, accusations, of, genocide, and, were, therefore, unwilling, to, press, charges, against, the, other, party, despite, political, pressure, to, charge, soviet, genocide, the, united, states, government, refused, to, ratify, the, convention, fearing, countercharges, of, racial, segregation, against, african, americans, the, first, conviction, for, genocide, in, an, international, court, was, in, 1998, for, a, perpetrator, of, the, rwandan, genocide, the, first, head, of, state, to, be, convicted, of, genocide, was, in, 2018, for, the, cambodian, genocide, prosecutions, for, genocide, do, not, obviously, satisfy, any, of, the, purposes, that, criminal, prosecution, is, supposed, to, serve, retribution, is, impossible, because, any, punishment, proportionate, to, the, crime, would, require, collective, punishment, which, violates, the, principle, of, individual, guilt, the, most, plausible, rationale, for, prosecuting, genocide, perpetrators, is, that, it, could, prevent, future, genocides, but, very, few, perpetrators, are, ever, brought, to, trial, and, evidence, of, a, deterrent, effect, is, lacking, however, genocide, prosecutions, might, still, serve, the, goal, of, upholding, the, power, of, international, law, the, field, of, genocide, studies, emerged, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, as, social, science, began, to, consider, the, phenomenon, of, genocide, due, to, the, occurrence, of, the, bosnian, genocide, rwandan, genocide, and, the, kosovo, crisis, genocide, studies, exploded, in, the, 1990s, in, contrast, to, earlier, researchers, who, took, for, granted, the, idea, that, liberal, and, democratic, societies, were, less, likely, to, commit, genocide, revisionists, associated, with, the, international, network, of, genocide, scholars, emphasized, how, western, ideas, led, to, genocide, pioneers, of, research, into, settler, colonialism, such, as, patrick, wolfe, spelled, out, the, genocidal, logic, of, settler, projects, prompting, a, rethinking, of, colonialism, the, definition, of, genocide, generates, controversy, whenever, a, new, case, arises, and, debate, erupts, as, to, whether, or, not, it, qualifies, as, a, genocide, sociologist, martin, shaw, writes, few, ideas, are, as, important, in, public, debate, but, in, few, cases, are, the, meaning, and, scope, of, a, key, idea, less, clearly, agreed, some, scholars, and, activists, use, the, genocide, convention, definition, others, prefer, narrower, definitions, that, indicate, genocide, is, rare, in, human, history, reducing, genocide, to, mass, killing, or, distinguishing, it, from, other, types, of, violence, by, the, innocence, helplessness, or, defencelessness, of, its, victims, most, genocides, occur, during, wartime, and, distinguishing, genocide, or, genocidal, war, from, non, genocidal, warfare, can, be, difficult, likewise, genocide, is, distinguished, from, violent, and, coercive, forms, of, rule, that, aim, to, change, behavior, rather, than, destroy, groups, some, definitions, include, political, or, social, groups, as, potential, victims, of, genocide, many, of, the, more, sociologically, oriented, definitions, of, genocide, overlap, that, of, the, crime, against, humanity, of, extermination, which, refers, to, large, scale, killing, or, induced, death, as, part, of, a, systematic, attack, on, a, civilian, population, isolated, or, short, lived, phenomena, that, resemble, genocide, can, be, termed, genocidal, violence, cultural, genocide, or, ethnocide, actions, targeted, at, the, reproduction, of, a, group, s, language, culture, or, way, of, life, was, part, of, raphael, lemkin, s, original, concept, and, its, proponents, in, the, 1940s, argued, that, it, along, with, physical, genocide, were, two, mechanisms, aiming, at, the, same, goal, destruction, of, the, targeted, group, because, cultural, genocide, clearly, applied, to, some, colonial, and, assimilationist, policies, several, states, with, overseas, colonies, threatened, to, refuse, to, ratify, the, convention, unless, it, was, excluded, most, genocide, scholars, believe, that, both, cultural, genocide, and, structural, violence, should, be, included, in, the, definition, of, genocide, if, committed, with, intent, to, destroy, the, targeted, group, although, included, in, lemkin, s, original, concept, and, by, some, scholars, political, groups, were, also, excluded, from, the, genocide, convention, the, result, of, this, exclusion, was, that, perpetrators, of, genocide, could, redefine, their, targets, as, being, a, political, or, military, enemy, thus, excluding, them, from, consideration, most, civilian, killings, in, the, twentieth, century, were, not, from, genocide, which, only, applies, to, select, cases, alternative, terms, have, been, coined, to, describe, processes, left, outside, narrower, definitions, of, genocide, ethnic, cleansing, the, forced, expulsion, of, a, population, from, a, given, territory, has, achieved, widespread, currency, although, many, scholars, recognize, that, it, frequently, overlaps, with, genocide, even, where, lemkin, s, definition, is, not, used, other, terms, have, proliferated, such, as, rudolph, rummel, s, democide, for, the, killing, of, people, by, a, government, words, like, ethnocide, gendercide, politicide, classicide, and, urbicide, were, coined, for, the, destruction, of, particular, types, of, groupings, ethnic, groups, genders, political, groups, social, classes, and, a, particular, locality, historian, a, dirk, moses, argues, that, because, of, its, position, as, the, crime, of, crimes, the, concept, of, genocide, blinds, us, to, other, types, of, humanly, caused, civilian, death, like, bombing, cities, and, the, collateral, damage, of, missile, and, drone, strikes, blockades, and, sanctions, lemkin, applied, the, concept, of, genocide, to, a, wide, variety, of, events, throughout, human, history, he, and, other, scholars, date, the, first, genocides, to, prehistoric, times, genocide, is, mentioned, in, various, ancient, sources, including, the, hebrew, bible, in, which, god, commanded, genocide, herem, against, some, of, the, israelites, enemies, especially, amalek, genocide, in, the, ancient, world, often, consisted, of, the, massacre, of, men, and, the, enslavement, or, forced, assimilation, of, women, and, children, often, limited, to, a, particular, town, or, city, rather, than, applied, to, a, larger, group, the, destruction, of, indigenous, societies, as, part, of, european, colonialism, including, in, colonial, states, such, as, united, states, and, australia, was, initially, not, recognized, as, a, form, of, genocide, such, genocides, were, often, characterized, by, an, initial, violent, struggle, for, land, and, resources, on, an, imperial, frontier, which, escalates, to, extermination, later, on, the, survivors, face, ongoing, genocide, in, the, form, of, a, wide, range, of, eliminatory, practices, such, as, cultural, suppression, expulsion, segregation, child, confiscation, assimilation, and, of, course, continued, violence, according, to, mohamed, adhikari, the, two, main, drivers, of, settler, genocide, is, in, the, long, run, the, pursuit, of, profit, on, the, global, commodity, market, and, in, the, short, run, indigenous, resistance, that, triggered, settler, retaliation, economic, activities, such, as, mining, ranching, and, agriculture, prove, so, destructive, to, indigenous, societies, that, the, elimination, of, indigenous, people, is, quicker, when, settlers, are, more, integrated, into, global, markets, and, have, a, higher, expectation, of, profit, while, the, lack, of, law, enforcement, on, the, frontier, ensured, impunity, for, settler, violence, the, closing, of, the, frontier, enabled, settlers, to, consolidate, their, gains, using, the, legal, system, according, to, mark, levene, seeing, native, people, as, savages, and, racism, played, a, critical, role, in, psychocultural, justifications, for, genocide, in, areas, such, as, australia, and, north, america, genocide, was, committed, on, a, large, scale, during, both, world, wars, the, prototypical, genocide, the, holocaust, involved, such, large, scale, logistics, that, it, reinforced, the, impression, that, genocide, was, the, result, of, civilization, drifting, off, course, and, required, both, the, weapons, and, infrastructure, of, the, modern, state, and, the, radical, ambitions, of, the, modern, man, scientific, racism, and, nationalism, were, common, ideological, drivers, of, many, twentieth, century, genocides, we, have, been, reproached, for, making, no, distinction, between, the, innocent, armenians, and, the, guilty, but, that, was, utterly, impossible, in, view, of, the, fact, that, those, who, are, innocent, today, might, be, guilty, tomorrow, the, concern, for, the, safety, of, turkey, simply, had, to, silence, all, other, concerns, talaat, pasha, in, berliner, tageblatt, 4, may, 1916, genocide, is, not, an, end, of, itself, but, a, means, to, another, end, often, chosen, by, perpetrators, after, other, options, failed, moses, argues, that, security, particularly, the, quest, for, absolute, security, informed, by, paranoia, is, the, underlying, rationale, behind, all, atrocity, crimes, including, genocide, genocide, perpetrators, harm, noncombatants, along, with, combatants, because, of, the, collective, guilt, ascribed, to, an, entire, people, defined, according, to, race, but, targeted, because, of, its, supposed, security, threat, likewise, jonathan, leader, maynard, argues, that, mass, killings, are, strategies, to, achieve, familiar, security, centric, aims, such, as, defeating, perceived, enemies, upholding, regimes, policing, societies, and, winning, wars, but, argues, that, ideological, factors, are, necessary, to, explain, why, such, atrocities, seem, to, be, a, desirable, solution, to, the, identified, security, problem, when, exaggerations, of, the, threat, are, combined, with, such, rationales, as, military, necessity, defense, against, aggression, and, national, security, people, can, be, induced, to, support, extreme, atrocities, other, motives, for, genocide, have, included, theft, land, grabbing, and, revenge, a, large, proportion, of, genocides, occurred, under, the, course, of, imperial, expansion, and, power, consolidation, the, organizer, of, genocide, is, often, assumed, to, be, a, centralized, totalitarian, government, while, genocides, are, often, carried, out, by, states, and, military, forces, in, many, cases, paramilitaries, and, other, decentralized, forces, are, involved, in, response, to, greater, international, scrutiny, of, genocide, state, sponsored, atrocities, can, be, carried, out, in, secrecy, by, paramilitary, groups, that, are, offered, impunity, for, their, crimes, this, offers, the, benefit, of, plausible, deniability, while, widening, complicity, in, the, atrocities, although, genocide, is, typically, organized, around, pre, existing, identity, boundaries, it, has, the, outcome, of, strengthening, them, although, many, scholars, have, emphasized, the, role, of, ideology, in, genocide, there, is, little, agreement, in, how, ideology, contributes, to, violent, outcomes, others, have, cited, rational, explanations, for, atrocities, how, ordinary, people, can, become, involved, in, extraordinary, violence, under, circumstances, of, acute, conflict, is, poorly, understood, the, foot, soldiers, of, genocide, as, opposed, to, its, organizers, are, not, demographically, or, psychologically, aberrant, people, who, commit, crimes, during, genocide, often, do, not, fit, stereotypes, of, evil, nor, recognize, themselves, as, perpetrators, furthermore, researchers, have, recognized, that, people, s, behavior, changes, under, the, course, of, events, and, someone, might, choose, to, kill, one, genocide, victim, while, saving, another, although, genocide, perpetrators, have, often, been, assumed, to, be, male, the, role, of, women, in, perpetrating, genocide, although, they, were, historically, excluded, from, leadership, has, also, been, explored, anthropologist, richard, rechtman, writes, that, in, circumstances, where, atrocities, such, as, genocides, are, perpetrated, many, people, refuse, to, become, perpetrators, which, often, entails, great, sacrifices, such, as, risking, their, lives, and, fleeing, their, country, according, to, rational, choice, theory, it, should, be, possible, to, intervene, to, prevent, genocide, by, raising, the, costs, of, engaging, in, such, violence, relative, to, alternatives, responsibility, to, protect, is, a, doctrine, that, emerged, around, 2000, in, the, aftermath, of, several, genocides, around, the, world, that, seeks, to, balance, state, sovereignty, with, the, need, for, international, intervention, to, prevent, genocide, yet, in, practice, it, is, primarily, deployed, by, the, united, states, and, its, allies, against, less, powerful, countries, without, affecting, the, immunity, of, powerful, countries, and, their, allies, from, legal, liability, for, genocide, most, of, the, qualitative, research, on, genocide, has, focused, on, the, testimonies, of, victims, survivors, and, other, eyewitnesses, studies, of, genocide, survivors, have, examined, rates, of, depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, suicide, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, and, post, traumatic, growth, while, some, have, found, negative, results, others, find, no, association, with, genocide, survival, there, are, no, consistent, findings, that, children, of, genocide, survivors, have, worse, health, than, comparable, individuals, the, word, genocide, inherently, carries, a, value, judgement, as, it, is, widely, considered, to, be, the, epitome, of, human, evil, in, the, past, this, was, not, the, case, and, violence, that, could, be, labeled, genocide, was, sometimes, celebrated, although, it, always, had, its, critics, although, in, a, strict, legal, sense, genocide, is, not, more, severe, than, other, atrocity, crimes, crimes, against, humanity, or, war, crimes, it, is, often, perceived, as, the, crime, of, crimes, and, grabs, attention, more, effectively, than, other, violations, of, international, law, consequently, victims, of, atrocities, often, label, their, suffering, genocide, as, an, attempt, to, gain, attention, to, their, plight, and, attract, foreign, intervention, the, colloquial, understanding, of, genocide, is, heavily, influenced, by, the, holocaust, as, its, archetype, and, is, conceived, as, innocent, victims, targeted, for, their, ethnic, identity, rather, than, for, any, political, reason, genocide, is, incorrectly, conceived, of, as, a, large, scale, hate, crime, motivated, by, racism, instead, of, political, reasons, although, this, does, not, accurately, identify, the, motivations, for, the, holocaust, itself
