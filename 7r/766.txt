human, intelligence, is, the, intellectual, capability, of, humans, which, is, marked, by, complex, cognitive, feats, and, high, levels, of, motivation, and, self, awareness, using, their, intelligence, humans, are, able, to, learn, form, concepts, understand, and, apply, logic, and, reason, human, intelligence, is, also, thought, to, encompass, their, capacities, to, recognize, patterns, plan, innovate, solve, problems, make, decisions, retain, information, and, use, language, to, communicate, there, are, conflicting, ideas, about, how, intelligence, should, be, conceptualized, and, measured, in, psychometrics, human, intelligence, is, commonly, assessed, by, intelligence, quotient, iq, tests, although, the, validity, of, these, tests, is, disputed, several, subcategories, of, intelligence, such, as, emotional, intelligence, and, social, intelligence, have, been, proposed, and, there, remains, significant, debate, as, to, whether, these, represent, distinct, forms, of, intelligence, there, is, also, ongoing, debate, regarding, how, an, individual, s, level, of, intelligence, is, formed, ranging, from, the, idea, that, intelligence, is, fixed, at, birth, to, the, idea, that, it, is, malleable, and, can, change, depending, on, a, person, s, mindset, and, efforts, as, a, construct, and, as, measured, by, intelligence, tests, intelligence, is, one, of, the, most, useful, concepts, in, psychology, because, it, correlates, with, many, relevant, variables, for, instance, the, probability, of, suffering, an, accident, or, the, amount, of, one, s, salary, other, examples, include, in, psychology, human, intelligence, is, commonly, assessed, by, iq, scores, that, are, determined, by, iq, tests, in, general, higher, iq, scores, are, associated, with, better, outcomes, in, life, however, while, iq, test, scores, show, a, high, degree, of, inter, test, reliability, and, predict, certain, forms, of, achievement, effectively, their, construct, validity, as, a, holistic, measure, of, human, intelligence, is, considered, dubious, while, iq, tests, are, generally, understood, to, measure, some, forms, of, intelligence, they, may, fail, to, serve, as, an, accurate, measure, of, broader, definitions, of, human, intelligence, inclusive, of, creativity, and, social, intelligence, according, to, psychologist, wayne, weiten, iq, tests, are, valid, measures, of, the, kind, of, intelligence, necessary, to, do, well, in, academic, work, but, if, the, purpose, is, to, assess, intelligence, in, a, broader, sense, the, validity, of, iq, tests, is, questionable, howard, gardner, s, theory, of, multiple, intelligences, is, based, on, studies, of, normal, children, and, adults, of, gifted, individuals, including, so, called, savants, of, persons, who, have, suffered, brain, damage, of, experts, and, virtuosos, and, of, individuals, from, diverse, cultures, gardner, breaks, intelligence, down, into, components, in, the, first, edition, of, his, book, frames, of, mind, 1983, he, described, seven, distinct, types, of, intelligence, logical, mathematical, linguistic, spatial, musical, kinesthetic, interpersonal, and, intrapersonal, in, a, second, edition, he, added, two, more, types, of, intelligence, naturalist, and, existential, intelligences, he, argues, that, psychometric, iq, tests, address, only, linguistic, and, logical, plus, some, aspects, of, spatial, intelligence, a, criticism, of, gardner, s, theory, is, that, it, has, never, been, tested, or, subjected, to, peer, review, by, gardner, or, anyone, else, and, indeed, that, it, is, unfalsifiable, others, e, g, locke, 2005, suggest, that, recognizing, many, specific, forms, of, intelligence, specific, aptitude, theory, implies, a, political, rather, than, scientific, agenda, intended, to, appreciate, the, uniqueness, in, all, individuals, rather, than, recognizing, potentially, true, and, meaningful, differences, in, individual, capacities, schmidt, and, hunter, suggest, that, the, predictive, validity, of, specific, aptitudes, over, and, above, that, of, general, mental, ability, or, g, has, not, received, empirical, support, on, the, other, hand, jerome, bruner, agreed, with, gardner, that, the, intelligences, were, useful, fictions, and, went, on, to, state, that, his, approach, is, so, far, beyond, the, data, crunching, of, mental, testers, that, it, deserves, to, be, cheered, robert, sternberg, proposed, the, triarchic, theory, of, intelligence, to, provide, a, more, comprehensive, description, of, intellectual, competence, than, traditional, differential, or, cognitive, theories, of, human, ability, the, triarchic, theory, describes, three, fundamental, aspects, of, intelligence, the, triarchic, theory, does, not, argue, against, the, validity, of, a, general, intelligence, factor, instead, the, theory, posits, that, general, intelligence, is, part, of, analytic, intelligence, and, only, by, considering, all, three, aspects, of, intelligence, can, the, full, range, of, intellectual, functioning, be, understood, sternberg, updated, the, triarchic, theory, and, renamed, it, to, the, theory, of, successful, intelligence, he, now, defines, intelligence, as, an, individual, s, assessment, of, success, in, life, by, the, individual, s, own, idiographic, standards, and, within, the, individual, s, sociocultural, context, success, is, achieved, by, using, combinations, of, analytical, creative, and, practical, intelligence, the, three, aspects, of, intelligence, are, referred, to, as, processing, skills, the, processing, skills, are, applied, to, the, pursuit, of, success, through, what, were, the, three, elements, of, practical, intelligence, adapting, to, shaping, of, and, selecting, of, one, s, environments, the, mechanisms, that, employ, the, processing, skills, to, achieve, success, include, utilizing, one, s, strengths, and, compensating, or, correcting, for, one, s, weaknesses, sternberg, s, theories, and, research, on, intelligence, remain, contentious, within, the, scientific, community, based, on, a, r, luria, s, 1966, seminal, work, on, the, modularization, of, brain, function, and, supported, by, decades, of, neuroimaging, research, the, pass, theory, of, intelligence, planning, attention, simultaneous, successive, proposes, that, cognition, is, organized, in, three, systems, and, the, following, four, processes, these, four, processes, are, functions, of, four, areas, of, the, brain, planning, is, broadly, located, in, the, front, part, of, our, brains, the, frontal, lobe, attention, and, arousal, are, combined, functions, of, the, frontal, lobe, and, the, lower, parts, of, the, cortex, although, the, parietal, lobes, are, also, involved, in, attention, as, well, simultaneous, processing, and, successive, processing, occur, in, the, posterior, region, or, the, back, of, the, brain, simultaneous, processing, is, broadly, associated, with, the, occipital, and, the, parietal, lobes, while, successive, processing, is, broadly, associated, with, the, frontal, temporal, lobes, the, pass, theory, is, heavily, indebted, both, to, luria, and, to, studies, in, cognitive, psychology, involved, in, promoting, a, better, look, at, intelligence, in, piaget, s, theory, of, cognitive, development, the, focus, is, not, on, mental, abilities, but, rather, on, a, child, s, mental, models, of, the, world, as, a, child, develops, the, child, creates, increasingly, more, accurate, models, of, the, world, which, enable, the, child, to, interact, with, the, world, more, effectively, one, example, is, object, permanence, with, which, the, child, develops, a, model, in, which, objects, continue, to, exist, even, when, they, cannot, be, seen, heard, or, touched, piaget, s, theory, described, four, main, stages, and, many, sub, stages, in, the, development, these, four, main, stages, are, progress, through, these, stages, is, correlated, with, but, not, identical, to, psychometric, iq, piaget, conceptualizes, intelligence, as, an, activity, more, than, as, a, capacity, one, of, piaget, s, most, famous, studies, focused, purely, on, the, discriminative, abilities, of, children, between, the, ages, of, two, and, a, half, years, old, and, four, and, a, half, years, old, he, began, the, study, by, taking, children, of, different, ages, and, placing, two, lines, of, sweets, one, with, the, sweets, in, a, line, spread, further, apart, and, one, with, the, same, number, of, sweets, in, a, line, placed, more, closely, together, he, found, that, children, between, 2, years, 6, months, old, and, 3, years, 2, months, old, correctly, discriminate, the, relative, number, of, objects, in, two, rows, between, 3, years, 2, months, and, 4, years, 6, months, they, indicate, a, longer, row, with, fewer, objects, to, have, more, after, 4, years, 6, months, they, again, discriminate, correctly, initially, younger, children, were, not, studied, because, if, at, the, age, of, four, years, a, child, could, not, conserve, quantity, then, a, younger, child, presumably, could, not, either, the, results, show, however, that, children, that, are, younger, than, three, years, and, two, months, have, quantity, conservation, but, as, they, get, older, they, lose, this, quality, and, do, not, recover, it, until, four, and, a, half, years, old, this, attribute, may, be, lost, temporarily, because, of, an, overdependence, on, perceptual, strategies, which, correlates, more, candy, with, a, longer, line, of, candy, or, because, of, the, inability, for, a, four, year, old, to, reverse, situations, this, experiment, demonstrated, several, results, first, younger, children, have, a, discriminative, ability, that, shows, the, logical, capacity, for, cognitive, operations, exists, earlier, than, previously, acknowledged, also, young, children, can, be, equipped, with, certain, qualities, for, cognitive, operations, depending, on, how, logical, the, structure, of, the, task, is, research, also, shows, that, children, develop, explicit, understanding, at, age, five, and, as, a, result, the, child, will, count, the, sweets, to, decide, which, has, more, finally, the, study, found, that, overall, quantity, conservation, is, not, a, basic, characteristic, of, humans, native, inheritance, piaget, s, theory, has, been, criticized, on, the, grounds, that, the, age, of, appearance, of, a, new, model, of, the, world, such, as, object, permanence, is, dependent, on, how, the, testing, is, done, see, the, article, on, object, permanence, more, generally, the, theory, may, be, very, difficult, to, test, empirically, because, of, the, difficulty, of, proving, or, disproving, that, a, mental, model, is, the, explanation, for, the, results, of, the, testing, neo, piagetian, theories, of, cognitive, development, expand, piaget, s, theory, in, various, ways, such, as, also, considering, psychometric, like, factors, such, as, processing, speed, and, working, memory, hypercognitive, factors, like, self, monitoring, more, stages, and, more, consideration, on, how, progress, may, vary, in, different, domains, such, as, spatial, or, social, based, on, a, review, of, 37, neuroimaging, studies, jung, and, haier, proposed, that, the, biological, basis, of, intelligence, stems, from, how, well, the, frontal, and, parietal, regions, of, the, brain, communicate, and, exchange, information, with, each, other, subsequent, neuroimaging, and, lesion, studies, report, general, consensus, with, the, theory, a, review, of, the, neuroscience, and, intelligence, literature, concludes, that, the, parieto, frontal, integration, theory, is, the, best, available, explanation, for, human, intelligence, differences, based, on, the, cattell, horn, carroll, theory, the, tests, of, intelligence, most, often, used, in, the, relevant, studies, include, measures, of, fluid, ability, g, f, and, crystallized, ability, g, c, that, differ, in, their, trajectory, of, development, in, people, the, investment, theory, by, cattell, states, that, the, individual, differences, observed, in, the, procurement, of, skills, and, knowledge, g, c, are, partially, attributed, to, the, investment, of, g, f, thus, suggesting, the, involvement, of, fluid, intelligence, in, every, aspect, of, the, learning, process, the, investment, theory, suggests, that, personality, traits, affect, actual, ability, and, not, scores, on, an, iq, test, hebb, s, theory, of, intelligence, suggested, a, bifurcation, as, well, intelligence, a, physiological, that, could, be, seen, as, a, semblance, of, fluid, intelligence, and, intelligence, b, experiential, similar, to, crystallized, intelligence, the, intelligence, compensation, theory, states, that, individuals, who, are, comparatively, less, intelligent, work, harder, and, more, methodically, and, become, more, resolute, and, thorough, more, conscientious, in, order, to, achieve, goals, to, compensate, for, their, lack, of, intelligence, whereas, more, intelligent, individuals, do, not, require, traits, behaviours, associated, with, the, personality, factor, conscientiousness, to, progress, as, they, can, rely, on, the, strength, of, their, cognitive, abilities, as, opposed, to, structure, or, effort, the, theory, suggests, the, existence, of, a, causal, relationship, between, intelligence, and, conscientiousness, such, that, the, development, of, the, personality, trait, of, conscientiousness, is, influenced, by, intelligence, this, assumption, is, deemed, plausible, as, it, is, unlikely, that, the, reverse, causal, relationship, could, occur, implying, that, the, negative, correlation, would, be, higher, between, fluid, intelligence, g, f, and, conscientiousness, this, is, justified, by, the, timeline, of, development, of, g, f, g, c, and, personality, as, crystallized, intelligence, would, not, have, developed, completely, when, personality, traits, develop, subsequently, during, school, going, ages, more, conscientious, children, would, be, expected, to, gain, more, crystallized, intelligence, knowledge, through, education, as, they, would, be, more, efficient, thorough, hard, working, and, dutiful, this, theory, has, recently, been, contradicted, by, evidence, that, identifies, compensatory, sample, selection, which, attributes, the, findings, to, the, bias, that, comes, from, selecting, samples, containing, people, above, a, certain, threshold, of, achievement, the, view, of, cognitive, ability, has, evolved, over, the, years, and, it, is, no, longer, viewed, as, a, fixed, property, held, by, an, individual, instead, the, current, perspective, describes, it, as, a, general, capacity, comprising, not, only, cognitive, but, motivational, social, and, behavioural, aspects, as, well, these, facets, work, together, to, perform, numerous, tasks, an, essential, skill, often, overlooked, is, that, of, managing, emotions, and, aversive, experiences, that, can, compromise, one, s, quality, of, thought, and, activity, bandura, bridges, the, link, between, intelligence, and, success, by, crediting, individual, differences, in, self, efficacy, bandura, s, theory, identifies, the, difference, between, possessing, skills, and, being, able, to, apply, them, in, challenging, situations, the, theory, suggests, that, individuals, with, the, same, level, of, knowledge, and, skill, may, perform, badly, averagely, or, excellently, based, on, differences, in, self, efficacy, a, key, role, of, cognition, is, to, allow, for, one, to, predict, events, and, in, turn, devise, methods, to, deal, with, these, events, effectively, these, skills, are, dependent, on, processing, of, unclear, and, ambiguous, stimuli, people, must, be, able, to, rely, on, their, reserve, of, knowledge, to, identify, develop, and, execute, options, they, must, be, able, to, apply, the, learning, acquired, from, previous, experiences, thus, a, stable, sense, of, self, efficacy, is, essential, to, stay, focused, on, tasks, in, the, face, of, challenging, situations, bandura, s, theory, of, self, efficacy, and, intelligence, suggests, that, individuals, with, a, relatively, low, sense, of, self, efficacy, in, any, field, will, avoid, challenges, this, effect, is, heightened, when, they, perceive, the, situations, as, personal, threats, when, failure, occurs, they, recover, from, it, more, slowly, than, others, and, credit, the, failure, to, an, insufficient, aptitude, on, the, other, hand, persons, with, high, levels, of, self, efficacy, hold, a, task, diagnostic, aim, that, leads, to, effective, performance, developed, by, ackerman, the, ppik, process, personality, intelligence, and, knowledge, theory, further, develops, the, approach, on, intelligence, as, proposed, by, cattell, the, investment, theory, and, hebb, suggesting, a, distinction, between, intelligence, as, knowledge, and, intelligence, as, process, two, concepts, that, are, comparable, and, related, to, g, c, and, g, f, respectively, but, broader, and, closer, to, hebb, s, notions, of, intelligence, a, and, intelligence, b, and, integrating, these, factors, with, elements, such, as, personality, motivation, and, interests, ackerman, describes, the, difficulty, of, distinguishing, process, from, knowledge, as, content, cannot, be, eliminated, from, any, ability, test, personality, traits, are, not, significantly, correlated, with, the, intelligence, as, process, aspect, except, in, the, context, of, psychopathology, one, exception, to, this, generalization, has, been, the, finding, of, sex, differences, in, cognitive, abilities, specifically, abilities, in, mathematical, and, spatial, form, on, the, other, hand, the, intelligence, as, knowledge, factor, has, been, associated, with, personality, traits, of, openness, and, typical, intellectual, engagement, which, also, strongly, correlate, with, verbal, abilities, associated, with, crystallized, intelligence, it, appears, that, latent, inhibition, the, phenomenon, of, familiar, stimuli, having, a, postponed, reaction, time, when, compared, with, unfamiliar, stimuli, has, a, positive, correlation, with, creativity, because, intelligence, appears, to, be, at, least, partly, dependent, on, brain, structure, and, the, genes, shaping, brain, development, it, has, been, proposed, that, genetic, engineering, could, be, used, to, enhance, intelligence, a, process, sometimes, called, biological, uplift, in, science, fiction, genetic, enhancement, experiments, on, mice, have, demonstrated, superior, ability, in, learning, and, memory, in, various, behavioral, tasks, a, 2021, study, showed, that, the, abecedarian, early, intervention, project, resulted, in, significant, changes, in, midlife, brain, structure, in, males, mri, scans, showed, that, several, brain, regions, and, total, brain, volumes, were, substantially, larger, in, participants, of, the, child, care, program, than, in, the, control, group, higher, iq, leads, to, greater, success, in, education, but, independently, education, raises, iq, scores, a, 2017, meta, analysis, suggests, education, increases, iq, by, 1, 5, points, per, year, of, education, or, at, least, increases, iq, test, taking, ability, substances, which, actually, or, purportedly, improve, intelligence, or, other, mental, functions, are, called, nootropics, a, meta, analysis, shows, omega, 3, fatty, acids, improve, cognitive, performance, among, those, with, cognitive, deficits, but, not, among, healthy, subjects, a, meta, regression, shows, omega, 3, fatty, acids, improve, the, moods, of, patients, with, major, depression, major, depression, is, associated, with, cognitive, nutrient, deficits, there, is, research, and, development, about, the, cognitive, impacts, of, smartphones, and, digital, technology, a, group, reported, that, contrary, to, widespread, belief, scientific, evidence, does, not, show, that, these, technologies, harm, biological, cognitive, abilities, and, that, they, instead, only, change, predominant, ways, of, cognition, such, as, a, reduced, need, to, remember, facts, or, conduct, mathematical, calculations, by, pen, and, paper, outside, contemporary, schools, however, some, activities, like, reading, novels, that, require, long, focused, attention, spans, and, do, not, feature, ongoing, rewarding, stimulation, may, become, more, challenging, in, general, how, extensive, online, media, usage, impacts, cognitive, development, in, youth, is, under, investigation, and, impacts, may, substantially, vary, by, the, way, and, which, technologies, are, being, used, such, as, which, and, how, digital, media, platforms, are, being, used, and, how, these, are, designed, impacts, may, vary, to, a, degree, such, studies, have, not, yet, taken, into, account, and, may, be, modulatable, by, the, design, choice, and, use, of, technologies, and, platforms, including, by, the, users, themselves, attempts, to, raise, iq, with, brain, training, have, led, to, increases, on, aspects, related, with, the, training, tasks, for, instance, working, memory, but, it, is, yet, unclear, if, these, increases, generalize, to, increased, intelligence, per, se, a, 2008, research, paper, claimed, that, practicing, a, dual, n, back, task, can, increase, fluid, intelligence, g, f, as, measured, in, several, different, standard, tests, this, finding, received, some, attention, from, popular, media, including, an, article, in, wired, however, a, subsequent, criticism, of, the, paper, s, methodology, questioned, the, experiment, s, validity, and, took, issue, with, the, lack, of, uniformity, in, the, tests, used, to, evaluate, the, control, and, test, groups, for, example, the, progressive, nature, of, raven, s, advanced, progressive, matrices, apm, test, may, have, been, compromised, by, modifications, of, time, restrictions, i, e, 10, minutes, were, allowed, to, complete, a, normally, 45, minute, test, efforts, to, influence, intelligence, raise, ethical, issues, neuroethics, considers, the, ethical, legal, and, social, implications, of, neuroscience, and, deals, with, issues, such, as, the, difference, between, treating, a, human, neurological, disease, and, enhancing, the, human, brain, and, how, wealth, impacts, access, to, neurotechnology, neuroethical, issues, interact, with, the, ethics, of, human, genetic, engineering, transhumanist, theorists, study, the, possibilities, and, consequences, of, developing, and, using, techniques, to, enhance, human, abilities, and, aptitudes, eugenics, is, a, social, philosophy, that, advocates, the, improvement, of, human, hereditary, traits, through, various, forms, of, intervention, eugenics, has, variously, been, regarded, as, meritorious, or, deplorable, in, different, periods, of, history, falling, greatly, into, disrepute, after, the, defeat, of, nazi, germany, in, world, war, ii, the, approach, to, understanding, intelligence, with, the, most, supporters, and, published, research, over, the, longest, period, of, time, is, based, on, psychometric, testing, it, is, also, by, far, the, most, widely, used, in, practical, settings, intelligence, quotient, iq, tests, include, the, stanford, binet, raven, s, progressive, matrices, the, wechsler, adult, intelligence, scale, and, the, kaufman, assessment, battery, for, children, there, are, also, psychometric, tests, that, are, not, intended, to, measure, intelligence, itself, but, some, closely, related, construct, such, as, scholastic, aptitude, in, the, united, states, examples, include, the, ssat, the, sat, the, act, the, gre, the, mcat, the, lsat, and, the, gmat, regardless, of, the, method, used, almost, any, test, that, requires, examinees, to, reason, and, has, a, wide, range, of, question, difficulty, will, produce, intelligence, scores, that, are, approximately, normally, distributed, in, the, general, population, intelligence, tests, are, widely, used, in, educational, business, and, military, settings, because, of, their, efficacy, in, predicting, behavior, iq, and, g, discussed, in, the, next, section, are, correlated, with, many, important, social, outcomes, individuals, with, low, iqs, are, more, likely, to, be, divorced, have, a, child, out, of, marriage, be, incarcerated, and, need, long, term, welfare, support, while, individuals, with, high, iqs, are, associated, with, more, years, of, education, higher, status, jobs, and, higher, income, intelligence, as, measured, by, psychometric, tests, has, been, found, to, be, highly, correlated, with, successful, training, and, performance, outcomes, e, g, adaptive, performance, and, iq, g, is, the, single, best, predictor, of, successful, job, performance, however, some, researchers, although, largely, concurring, with, this, finding, have, advised, caution, in, citing, the, strength, of, the, claim, due, to, a, number, of, factors, these, include, statistical, assumptions, imposed, underlying, some, of, these, studies, studies, done, prior, to, 1970, which, appear, inconsistent, with, more, recent, studies, and, ongoing, debates, within, the, psychology, literature, as, to, the, validity, of, current, iq, measurement, tools, there, are, many, different, kinds, of, iq, tests, using, a, wide, variety, of, test, tasks, some, tests, consist, of, a, single, type, of, task, others, rely, on, a, broad, collection, of, tasks, with, different, contents, visual, spatial, verbal, numerical, and, asking, for, different, cognitive, processes, e, g, reasoning, memory, rapid, decisions, visual, comparisons, spatial, imagery, reading, and, retrieval, of, general, knowledge, the, psychologist, charles, spearman, early, in, the, 20th, century, carried, out, the, first, formal, factor, analysis, of, correlations, between, various, test, tasks, he, found, a, trend, for, all, such, tests, to, correlate, positively, with, each, other, which, is, called, a, positive, manifold, spearman, found, that, a, single, common, factor, explained, the, positive, correlations, among, tests, spearman, named, it, g, for, general, intelligence, factor, he, interpreted, it, as, the, core, of, human, intelligence, that, to, a, larger, or, smaller, degree, influences, success, in, all, cognitive, tasks, and, thereby, creates, the, positive, manifold, this, interpretation, of, g, as, a, common, cause, of, test, performance, is, still, dominant, in, psychometrics, although, an, alternative, interpretation, was, recently, advanced, by, van, der, maas, and, colleagues, their, mutualism, model, assumes, that, intelligence, depends, on, several, independent, mechanisms, none, of, which, influences, performance, on, all, cognitive, tests, these, mechanisms, support, each, other, so, that, efficient, operation, of, one, of, them, makes, efficient, operation, of, the, others, more, likely, thereby, creating, the, positive, manifold, iq, tests, can, be, ranked, by, how, highly, they, load, on, the, g, factor, tests, with, high, g, loadings, are, those, that, correlate, highly, with, most, other, tests, one, comprehensive, study, investigating, the, correlations, between, a, large, collection, of, tests, and, tasks, has, found, that, the, raven, s, progressive, matrices, have, a, particularly, high, correlation, with, most, other, tests, and, tasks, the, raven, s, is, a, test, of, inductive, reasoning, with, abstract, visual, material, it, consists, of, a, series, of, problems, sorted, approximately, by, increasing, difficulty, each, problem, presents, a, 3, x, 3, matrix, of, abstract, designs, with, one, empty, cell, the, matrix, is, constructed, according, to, a, rule, and, the, person, must, find, out, the, rule, to, determine, which, of, 8, alternatives, fits, into, the, empty, cell, because, of, its, high, correlation, with, other, tests, the, raven, s, progressive, matrices, are, generally, acknowledged, as, a, good, indicator, of, general, intelligence, this, is, problematic, however, because, there, are, substantial, gender, differences, on, the, raven, s, which, are, not, found, when, g, is, measured, directly, by, computing, the, general, factor, from, a, broad, collection, of, tests, several, critics, such, as, stephen, jay, gould, have, been, critical, of, g, seeing, it, as, a, statistical, artifact, and, that, iq, tests, instead, measure, a, number, of, unrelated, abilities, the, 1995, american, psychological, association, s, report, intelligence, knowns, and, unknowns, stated, that, iq, tests, do, correlate, and, that, the, view, that, g, is, a, statistical, artifact, was, a, minority, one, a, recent, scientific, understanding, of, collective, intelligence, defined, as, a, group, s, general, ability, to, perform, a, wide, range, of, tasks, expands, the, areas, of, human, intelligence, research, applying, similar, methods, and, concepts, to, groups, definition, operationalization, and, methods, are, similar, to, the, psychometric, approach, of, general, individual, intelligence, where, an, individual, s, performance, on, a, given, set, of, cognitive, tasks, is, used, to, measure, intelligence, indicated, by, the, general, intelligence, factor, g, extracted, via, factor, analysis, in, the, same, vein, collective, intelligence, research, aims, to, discover, a, c, factor, explaining, between, group, differences, in, performance, as, well, as, structural, and, group, compositional, causes, for, it, several, different, theories, of, intelligence, have, historically, been, important, for, psychometrics, often, they, emphasized, more, factors, than, a, single, one, like, in, g, factor, many, of, the, broad, recent, iq, tests, have, been, greatly, influenced, by, the, cattell, horn, carroll, theory, it, is, argued, to, reflect, much, of, what, is, known, about, intelligence, from, research, a, hierarchy, of, factors, for, human, intelligence, is, used, g, is, at, the, top, under, it, there, are, 10, broad, abilities, that, in, turn, are, subdivided, into, 70, narrow, abilities, the, broad, abilities, are, modern, tests, do, not, necessarily, measure, of, all, of, these, broad, abilities, for, example, gq, and, grw, may, be, seen, as, measures, of, school, achievement, and, not, iq, gt, may, be, difficult, to, measure, without, special, equipment, g, was, earlier, often, subdivided, into, only, gf, and, gc, which, were, thought, to, correspond, to, the, nonverbal, or, performance, subtests, and, verbal, subtests, in, earlier, versions, of, the, popular, wechsler, iq, test, more, recent, research, has, shown, the, situation, to, be, more, complex, reliability, and, validity, are, very, different, concepts, while, reliability, reflects, reproducibility, validity, refers, to, whether, the, test, measures, what, it, purports, to, measure, while, iq, tests, are, generally, considered, to, measure, some, forms, of, intelligence, they, may, fail, to, serve, as, an, accurate, measure, of, broader, definitions, of, human, intelligence, inclusive, of, for, example, creativity, and, social, intelligence, for, this, reason, psychologist, wayne, weiten, argues, that, their, construct, validity, must, be, carefully, qualified, and, not, be, overstated, according, to, weiten, iq, tests, are, valid, measures, of, the, kind, of, intelligence, necessary, to, do, well, in, academic, work, but, if, the, purpose, is, to, assess, intelligence, in, a, broader, sense, the, validity, of, iq, tests, is, questionable, some, scientists, have, disputed, the, value, of, iq, as, a, measure, of, intelligence, altogether, in, the, mismeasure, of, man, 1981, expanded, edition, 1996, evolutionary, biologist, stephen, jay, gould, compared, iq, testing, with, the, now, discredited, practice, of, determining, intelligence, via, craniometry, arguing, that, both, are, based, on, the, fallacy, of, reification, our, tendency, to, convert, abstract, concepts, into, entities, gould, s, argument, sparked, a, great, deal, of, debate, and, the, book, is, listed, as, one, of, discover, magazine, s, 25, greatest, science, books, of, all, time, along, these, same, lines, critics, such, as, keith, stanovich, do, not, dispute, the, capacity, of, iq, test, scores, to, predict, some, kinds, of, achievement, but, argue, that, basing, a, concept, of, intelligence, on, iq, test, scores, alone, neglects, other, important, aspects, of, mental, ability, robert, sternberg, another, significant, critic, of, iq, as, the, main, measure, of, human, cognitive, abilities, argued, that, reducing, the, concept, of, intelligence, to, the, measure, of, g, does, not, fully, account, for, the, different, skills, and, knowledge, types, that, produce, success, in, human, society, a, study, suggested, that, intelligence, is, composed, of, distinct, cognitive, systems, each, of, which, having, its, own, capacity, and, being, to, some, degree, independent, of, other, components, with, the, cognitive, profile, being, emergent, from, anatomically, distinct, cognitive, systems, such, as, brain, regions, or, neural, networks, for, example, iq, and, reading, language, related, traits, skills, appear, to, be, influenced, at, least, partly, distinct, genetic, factors, various, types, of, potential, measures, related, to, some, definitions, of, intelligence, but, not, part, of, iq, measurement, include, human, intelligence, could, be, distinguished, from, potential, other, types, of, intelligences, which, may, include, those, of, some, may, belong, to, multiple, or, be, impossible, such, intelligences, if, they, exist, and, are, considered, intelligent, could, be, very, different, from, human, intelligences, research, may, e, g, investigate, differences, between, different, types, or, profiles, or, aspects, of, intelligences, such, as, between, modern, humans, and, archaic, humans, psychologists, have, shown, that, the, definition, of, human, intelligence, is, unique, to, the, culture, that, one, is, studying, robert, sternberg, is, among, the, researchers, who, have, discussed, how, one, s, culture, affects, the, person, s, interpretation, of, intelligence, and, he, further, believes, that, to, define, intelligence, in, only, one, way, without, considering, different, meanings, in, cultural, contexts, may, cast, an, investigative, and, unintentionally, egocentric, view, on, the, world, to, negate, this, psychologists, offer, the, following, definitions, of, intelligence, although, typically, identified, by, its, western, definition, multiple, studies, support, the, idea, that, human, intelligence, carries, different, meanings, across, cultures, around, the, world, in, many, eastern, cultures, intelligence, is, mainly, related, with, one, s, social, roles, and, responsibilities, a, chinese, conception, of, intelligence, would, define, it, as, the, ability, to, empathize, with, and, understand, others, although, this, is, by, no, means, the, only, way, that, intelligence, is, defined, in, china, in, several, african, communities, intelligence, is, shown, similarly, through, a, social, lens, however, rather, than, through, social, roles, as, in, many, eastern, cultures, it, is, exemplified, through, social, responsibilities, for, example, in, the, language, of, chi, chewa, which, is, spoken, by, some, ten, million, people, across, central, africa, the, equivalent, term, for, intelligence, implies, not, only, cleverness, but, also, the, ability, to, take, on, responsibility, furthermore, within, american, culture, there, are, a, variety, of, interpretations, of, intelligence, present, as, well, one, of, the, most, common, views, on, intelligence, within, american, societies, defines, it, as, a, combination, of, problem, solving, skills, deductive, reasoning, skills, and, intelligence, quotient, iq, while, other, american, societies, point, out, that, intelligent, people, should, have, a, social, conscience, accept, others, for, who, they, are, and, be, able, to, give, advice, or, wisdom, motivational, intelligence, refers, to, an, individual, s, capacity, to, comprehend, and, utilize, various, motivations, such, as, the, need, for, achievement, affiliation, or, power, it, involves, understanding, tacit, knowledge, related, to, these, motivations, this, concept, encompasses, the, ability, to, recognize, and, appreciate, the, diverse, values, behaviors, and, cultural, differences, of, others, driven, by, intrinsic, interest, rather, than, solely, to, enhance, interaction, effectiveness, research, suggests, a, relationship, between, motivational, intelligence, international, experiences, and, leadership, individuals, with, higher, levels, of, motivational, intelligence, tend, to, exhibit, greater, enthusiasm, for, learning, about, other, cultures, thereby, contributing, to, their, effectiveness, in, cross, cultural, settings, however, studies, have, also, revealed, variations, in, motivational, intelligence, across, ethnicities, with, asian, students, demonstrating, higher, cognitive, cultural, intelligence, but, lower, motivational, intelligence, compared, to, other, groups, investigations, have, explored, the, impact, of, motivational, intelligence, on, job, motivation, a, study, conducted, on, employees, of, isfahan, gas, company, indicated, a, positive, and, significant, relationship, between, motivational, intelligence, and, two, of, its, indicators, namely, adaptability, and, social, relationship, with, job, motivation, these, findings, highlight, the, potential, influence, of, motivational, intelligence, on, individuals, motivation, levels, within, work, contexts, motivational, intelligence, has, been, identified, as, a, strong, predictor, superseding, knowledge, intelligence, behavioral, intelligence, and, strategic, intelligence, it, holds, a, crucial, role, in, promoting, cooperation, which, is, considered, the, ideal, and, essential, element, of, motivational, intelligence, therapeutic, approaches, grounded, in, motivational, intelligence, emphasize, a, collaborative, partnership, between, the, therapist, and, client, the, therapist, creates, an, environment, conducive, to, change, without, imposing, their, views, or, attempting, to, force, awareness, or, acceptance, of, reality, onto, the, client, motivational, intelligence, encompasses, the, understanding, of, motivations, such, as, achievement, affiliation, and, power, as, well, as, the, appreciation, of, cultural, differences, and, values, it, has, been, found, to, impact, areas, such, as, international, experiences, leadership, job, motivation, and, cooperative, therapeutic, interventions
