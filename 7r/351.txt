a, writing, system, comprises, a, set, of, symbols, called, a, script, as, well, as, the, rules, by, which, the, script, represents, a, particular, language, the, earliest, writing, was, invented, during, the, late, 4th, millennium, bc, throughout, history, each, writing, system, invented, without, prior, knowledge, of, writing, gradually, evolved, from, a, system, of, proto, writing, that, included, a, small, number, of, ideograms, which, were, not, fully, capable, of, encoding, spoken, language, and, lacked, the, ability, to, express, a, broad, range, of, ideas, writing, systems, are, generally, classified, according, to, how, its, symbols, called, graphemes, generally, relate, to, units, of, language, phonetic, writing, systems, which, include, alphabets, and, syllabaries, use, graphemes, that, correspond, to, sounds, in, the, corresponding, spoken, language, alphabets, use, graphemes, called, letters, that, correspond, to, spoken, phonemes, with, abjads, only, having, letters, for, consonants, and, pure, alphabets, having, them, for, both, consonants, and, vowels, in, abugidas, graphemes, correspond, to, spoken, consonant, vowel, pairs, syllabaries, use, graphemes, called, syllabograms, that, represent, spoken, syllables, or, moras, by, contrast, morphographic, or, logographic, writing, systems, use, graphemes, that, represent, a, language, s, units, of, meaning, such, as, words, or, morphemes, alphabets, typically, use, fewer, than, 100, symbols, while, syllabaries, and, logographies, may, use, hundreds, or, thousands, respectively, a, writing, system, also, includes, any, punctuation, used, to, aid, readers, and, encode, additional, meaning, including, that, which, would, be, communicated, in, speech, via, qualities, of, rhythm, tone, pitch, accent, inflection, or, intonation, according, to, most, contemporary, definitions, writing, is, a, visual, and, tactile, notation, representing, language, the, symbols, used, in, writing, correspond, systematically, to, functional, units, of, either, a, spoken, or, signed, language, this, definition, excludes, a, broader, class, of, symbolic, markings, such, as, drawings, and, maps, a, text, is, any, instance, of, written, material, including, transcriptions, of, spoken, material, the, act, of, composing, and, recording, a, text, may, be, referred, to, as, writing, and, the, act, of, viewing, and, interpreting, the, text, as, reading, the, relationship, between, writing, and, language, more, broadly, has, been, the, subject, of, philosophical, analysis, as, early, as, aristotle, 384, 322, bc, while, the, use, of, language, is, universal, across, human, societies, writing, is, not, having, first, emerged, much, more, recently, and, only, having, been, independently, invented, in, a, handful, of, locations, throughout, history, while, most, spoken, languages, have, not, been, written, all, written, languages, have, been, predicated, on, an, existing, spoken, language, when, those, with, signed, languages, as, their, first, language, read, writing, associated, with, a, spoken, language, this, functions, as, literacy, in, a, second, acquired, language, a, single, language, e, g, hindustani, can, be, written, using, multiple, writing, systems, and, a, writing, system, can, also, represent, multiple, languages, for, example, chinese, characters, have, been, used, to, write, multiple, languages, throughout, the, sinosphere, including, the, vietnamese, language, from, at, least, the, 13th, century, until, their, replacement, with, the, latin, based, vietnamese, alphabet, in, the, 20th, century, in, the, first, several, decades, of, modern, linguistics, as, a, scientific, discipline, linguists, often, characterized, writing, as, merely, the, technology, used, to, record, speech, which, was, treated, as, being, of, paramount, importance, for, what, was, seen, as, the, unique, potential, for, its, study, to, further, the, understanding, of, human, cognition, while, certain, core, terminology, is, used, throughout, the, study, of, writing, systems, the, precise, interpretations, of, and, definitions, for, concepts, often, vary, depending, on, the, theoretical, model, employed, by, the, researcher, a, grapheme, is, the, basic, functional, unit, of, a, writing, system, graphemes, are, generally, defined, as, minimally, significant, elements, which, when, taken, together, comprise, the, set, of, symbols, from, which, texts, may, be, constructed, all, writing, systems, require, a, set, of, defined, graphemes, collectively, called, a, script, the, concept, of, the, grapheme, is, similar, to, that, of, the, phoneme, used, in, the, study, of, spoken, languages, likewise, as, many, sonically, distinct, phones, may, function, as, the, same, phoneme, depending, on, speaker, dialect, and, context, many, visually, distinct, glyphs, or, graphs, may, be, identified, as, the, same, grapheme, these, variant, glyphs, are, known, as, the, allographs, of, a, grapheme, for, example, the, lowercase, letter, a, may, be, represented, by, the, double, storey, a, and, single, storey, shapes, or, others, written, in, cursive, block, or, printed, styles, the, choice, of, a, particular, allograph, may, be, influenced, by, the, medium, used, the, writing, instrument, used, the, stylistic, choice, of, the, writer, the, preceding, and, succeeding, graphemes, in, the, text, the, time, available, for, writing, the, intended, audience, and, the, largely, unconscious, features, of, an, individual, s, handwriting, orthography, lit, correct, writing, refers, to, the, set, of, rules, and, conventions, shared, by, a, community, which, assigns, meaning, to, the, ordering, of, and, relationship, between, the, graphemes, particularly, for, alphabets, orthography, includes, the, concept, of, spelling, for, example, english, orthography, includes, the, uppercase, and, lowercase, forms, of, the, 26, letters, of, the, latin, alphabet, with, these, graphemes, corresponding, to, various, phonemes, punctuation, marks, mostly, non, phonemic, and, a, handful, of, other, symbols, such, as, numerals, writing, systems, may, be, regarded, as, complete, if, they, are, able, to, represent, all, that, may, be, expressed, in, the, spoken, language, while, a, partial, writing, system, cannot, represent, the, spoken, language, in, its, entirety, writing, systems, were, preceded, by, proto, writing, systems, consisting, of, ideograms, and, early, mnemonic, symbols, the, best, known, examples, are, writing, has, been, invented, independently, multiple, times, in, human, history, the, first, writing, systems, emerged, during, the, early, bronze, age, with, the, cuneiform, writing, system, used, to, write, sumerian, generally, considered, to, be, the, earliest, true, writing, closely, followed, by, the, egyptian, hieroglyphs, it, is, generally, agreed, that, the, two, systems, were, invented, independently, from, one, another, both, evolved, from, proto, writing, systems, between, 3400, and, 3200, bc, with, the, earliest, coherent, texts, dated, c, 2600, bc, chinese, characters, emerged, independently, in, the, yellow, river, valley, c, 1200, bc, there, is, no, evidence, of, contact, between, china, and, the, literate, peoples, of, the, near, east, and, the, mesopotamian, and, chinese, approaches, for, representing, aspects, of, sound, and, meaning, are, distinct, the, mesoamerican, writing, systems, including, olmec, and, the, maya, script, were, also, invented, independently, the, first, known, alphabetic, writing, appeared, before, 2000, bc, and, was, used, to, write, a, semitic, language, spoken, in, the, sinai, peninsula, most, of, the, world, s, alphabets, either, descend, directly, from, this, proto, sinaitic, script, or, were, directly, inspired, by, its, design, descendants, include, the, phoenician, alphabet, c, 1050, bc, and, its, child, in, the, greek, alphabet, c, 800, bc, the, latin, alphabet, which, descended, from, the, greek, alphabet, is, by, far, the, most, common, script, used, by, writing, systems, several, approaches, have, been, taken, to, classify, writing, systems, with, the, most, common, based, on, what, unit, of, language, is, represented, by, each, unit, of, writing, at, the, highest, level, writing, systems, are, either, phonographic, lit, sound, writing, when, graphemes, represent, units, of, sound, in, a, language, or, morphographic, lit, form, writing, when, graphemes, represent, units, of, meaning, such, as, words, or, morphemes, the, term, logographic, lit, word, writing, is, used, in, various, models, either, as, a, synonym, for, morphographic, or, as, a, specific, subtype, where, the, basic, unit, of, meaning, written, is, the, word, even, with, morphographic, writing, there, remains, a, correspondence, between, graphemes, and, the, sounds, of, speech, but, the, pronunciation, values, of, the, units, of, meaning, is, not, what, is, being, encoded, firstly, by, the, writing, system, many, classifications, are, three, fold, with, phonographic, systems, divided, into, syllabic, and, alphabetic, or, segmental, systems, syllabaries, use, symbols, called, syllabograms, to, represent, syllables, or, moras, alphabets, use, symbols, called, letters, that, correspond, to, spoken, phonemes, or, more, technically, to, diaphonemes, alphabets, consist, of, three, types, abjads, only, have, letters, for, consonants, while, pure, alphabets, have, letters, for, both, consonants, and, vowels, abugidas, use, characters, that, correspond, to, consonant, vowel, pairs, david, diringer, proposed, a, five, fold, classification, of, writing, systems, comprising, pictographic, scripts, ideographic, scripts, analytic, transitional, scripts, phonetic, scripts, and, alphabetic, scripts, a, logogram, is, a, character, that, represents, a, morpheme, within, a, language, chinese, characters, represent, the, only, major, logographic, writing, systems, still, in, use, they, have, historically, been, used, to, write, the, varieties, of, chinese, as, well, as, japanese, korean, vietnamese, and, other, languages, of, the, sinosphere, as, each, character, represents, a, single, unit, of, meaning, many, different, logograms, are, required, to, write, all, the, words, of, a, language, if, the, logograms, do, not, adequately, represent, all, meanings, and, words, of, a, language, written, language, can, be, confusing, or, ambiguous, to, the, reader, logograms, are, sometimes, conflated, with, ideograms, symbols, which, graphically, represent, abstract, ideas, most, linguists, now, reject, this, characterization, chinese, characters, are, often, semantic, phonetic, compounds, which, include, a, component, related, to, the, character, s, meaning, and, a, component, that, gives, a, hint, for, its, pronunciation, a, syllabary, is, a, set, of, written, symbols, that, represent, either, syllables, or, moras, a, unit, of, prosody, that, is, often, but, not, always, a, syllable, in, length, the, graphemes, used, in, syllabaries, are, called, syllabograms, syllabaries, are, best, suited, to, languages, with, relatively, simple, syllable, structure, since, a, different, symbol, is, needed, for, every, syllable, japanese, for, example, contains, about, 100, moras, which, are, represented, by, moraic, hiragana, by, contrast, english, features, complex, syllable, structures, with, a, relatively, large, inventory, of, vowels, and, complex, consonant, clusters, making, for, a, total, of, 15, 16, 000, distinct, syllables, some, syllabaries, have, larger, inventories, the, yi, script, contains, 756, different, symbols, an, alphabet, is, a, set, of, letters, each, of, which, generally, represent, one, of, the, segmental, phonemes, in, a, spoken, language, however, these, correspondences, are, rarely, uncomplicated, and, spelling, is, often, mediated, by, other, factors, than, just, which, sounds, are, used, by, a, speaker, the, word, alphabet, is, derived, from, alpha, and, beta, the, names, for, the, first, two, letters, in, the, greek, alphabet, an, abjad, is, an, alphabet, whose, letters, only, represent, the, consonantal, sounds, of, a, language, they, were, the, first, alphabets, to, develop, historically, with, most, that, have, been, developed, used, to, write, semitic, languages, and, originally, deriving, from, the, proto, sinaitic, script, the, morphology, of, semitic, languages, is, particularly, suited, to, this, approach, as, the, denotation, of, vowels, is, generally, redundant, optional, markings, for, vowels, may, be, used, for, some, abjads, but, are, generally, limited, to, applications, like, education, many, pure, alphabets, were, derived, from, abjads, through, the, addition, of, dedicated, vowel, letters, as, with, the, derivation, of, the, greek, alphabet, from, the, phoenician, alphabet, c, 800, bc, abjad, is, the, word, for, alphabet, in, arabic, and, malay, the, term, derives, from, the, traditional, order, of, the, arabic, alphabet, s, letters, alif, b, j, m, d, l, though, the, word, may, have, earlier, roots, in, phoenician, or, ugaritic, an, abugida, is, an, alphabetic, writing, system, whose, basic, signs, denote, consonants, with, an, inherent, vowel, and, where, consistent, modifications, of, the, basic, sign, indicate, other, following, vowels, than, the, inherent, one, in, an, abugida, there, may, be, a, sign, for, k, with, no, vowel, but, also, one, for, ka, if, a, is, the, inherent, vowel, and, ke, is, written, by, modifying, the, ka, sign, in, a, consistent, way, with, how, la, would, be, modified, to, get, le, in, many, abugidas, modification, consists, of, the, addition, of, a, vowel, sign, other, possibilities, include, rotation, of, the, basic, sign, or, addition, of, diacritics, while, true, syllabaries, have, one, symbol, per, syllable, and, no, systematic, visual, similarity, the, graphic, similarity, in, most, abugidas, stems, from, their, origins, as, abjads, with, added, symbols, comprising, markings, for, different, vowel, added, onto, a, pre, existing, base, symbol, the, largest, single, group, of, abugidas, is, the, brahmic, family, of, scripts, however, which, includes, nearly, all, the, scripts, used, in, india, and, southeast, asia, the, name, abugida, is, derived, from, the, first, four, characters, of, an, order, of, the, ge, ez, script, used, in, some, contexts, it, was, coined, as, a, linguistic, term, by, peter, t, daniels, b, 1951, who, borrowed, it, from, the, ethiopian, languages, originally, proposed, as, a, category, by, geoffrey, sampson, b, 1944, a, featural, system, uses, symbols, representing, sub, phonetic, elements, e, g, those, traits, that, can, be, used, to, distinguish, between, and, analyse, a, language, s, phonemes, such, as, their, voicing, or, place, of, articulation, the, only, prominent, example, of, a, featural, system, is, the, hangul, script, used, to, write, korean, where, featural, symbols, are, combined, into, letters, which, are, in, turn, joined, into, syllabic, blocks, many, scholars, including, john, defrancis, 1911, 2009, reject, a, characterization, of, hangul, as, a, featural, system, with, arguments, including, that, korean, writers, do, not, themselves, think, in, these, terms, when, writing, or, question, the, viability, of, sampson, s, category, altogether, as, hangul, was, consciously, created, by, literate, experts, daniels, characterizes, it, as, a, sophisticated, grammatogeny, a, writing, system, intentionally, designed, for, a, specific, purpose, as, opposed, to, having, evolved, gradually, over, time, other, grammatogenies, include, shorthands, developed, by, professionals, and, constructed, scripts, created, by, hobbyists, and, creatives, like, the, tengwar, script, designed, by, j, r, r, tolkien, to, write, the, elven, languages, he, also, designed, many, of, these, feature, advanced, graphic, designs, corresponding, to, phonological, properties, the, basic, unit, of, writing, in, these, systems, can, map, to, anything, from, phonemes, to, words, it, has, been, shown, that, even, the, latin, script, has, sub, character, features, in, linear, writing, which, includes, systems, like, the, latin, alphabet, and, chinese, characters, glyphs, are, made, up, of, lines, or, strokes, linear, writing, is, most, common, but, there, are, non, linear, writing, systems, where, glyphs, consist, of, other, types, of, marks, such, as, in, cuneiform, and, braille, egyptian, hieroglyphs, and, maya, script, were, often, painted, in, linear, outline, form, but, in, formal, contexts, they, were, carved, in, bas, relief, the, earliest, examples, of, writing, are, linear, while, cuneiform, was, not, linear, its, sumerian, ancestors, were, non, linear, systems, are, not, composed, of, lines, no, matter, what, instrument, is, used, to, write, them, cuneiform, was, likely, the, earliest, non, linear, writing, its, glyphs, were, formed, by, pressing, the, end, of, a, reed, stylus, into, moist, clay, not, by, tracing, lines, in, the, clay, with, the, stylus, as, had, been, done, previously, the, result, was, a, radical, transformation, of, the, appearance, of, the, script, braille, is, a, non, linear, adaptation, of, the, latin, alphabet, that, completely, abandoned, the, latin, forms, the, letters, are, composed, of, raised, bumps, on, the, writing, substrate, which, can, be, leather, stiff, paper, plastic, or, metal, there, are, also, transient, non, linear, adaptations, of, the, latin, alphabet, including, morse, code, the, manual, alphabets, of, various, sign, languages, and, semaphore, in, which, flags, or, bars, are, positioned, at, prescribed, angles, however, if, writing, is, defined, as, a, potentially, permanent, means, of, recording, information, then, these, systems, do, not, qualify, as, writing, at, all, since, the, symbols, disappear, as, soon, as, they, are, used, instead, these, transient, systems, serve, as, signals, writing, systems, may, be, characterized, by, how, text, is, graphically, divided, into, lines, which, are, to, be, read, in, sequence, for, example, english, and, many, other, western, languages, are, written, in, horizontal, rows, that, begin, at, the, top, of, a, page, and, end, at, the, bottom, with, each, row, read, from, left, to, right, egyptian, hieroglyphs, were, written, either, left, to, right, or, right, to, left, with, the, animal, and, human, glyphs, turned, to, face, the, beginning, of, the, line, the, early, alphabet, could, be, written, in, multiple, directions, horizontally, from, side, to, side, or, vertically, prior, to, standardization, alphabetic, writing, could, be, either, left, to, right, ltr, and, right, to, left, rtl, it, was, most, commonly, written, boustrophedonically, starting, in, one, horizontal, direction, then, turning, at, the, end, of, the, line, and, reversing, direction, the, greek, alphabet, and, its, successors, settled, on, a, left, to, right, pattern, from, the, top, to, the, bottom, of, the, page, other, scripts, such, as, arabic, and, hebrew, came, to, be, written, right, to, left, scripts, that, historically, incorporate, chinese, characters, have, traditionally, been, written, on, the, character, level, vertically, top, to, bottom, from, the, right, to, the, left, of, the, page, but, nowadays, are, frequently, written, left, to, right, top, to, bottom, due, to, western, influence, a, growing, need, to, accommodate, terms, in, the, latin, script, and, technical, limitations, in, popular, electronic, document, formats, and, the, fact, that, strokes, are, predominantly, written, from, top, to, bottom, and, left, to, right, and, this, is, also, the, order, in, which, they, are, written, within, every, character, several, scripts, used, in, the, philippines, and, indonesia, such, as, hanun, o, are, traditionally, written, with, lines, moving, away, from, the, writer, from, bottom, to, top, but, are, read, horizontally, left, to, right, however, kulitan, another, philippine, script, is, written, top, to, bottom, and, right, to, left, ogham, is, written, bottom, to, top, and, read, vertically, commonly, on, the, corner, of, a, stone, the, ancient, libyco, berber, alphabet, was, also, written, from, bottom, to, top, left, to, right, writing, has, the, advantage, that, since, most, people, are, right, handed, the, hand, does, not, interfere, with, the, just, written, text, which, might, not, yet, have, dried, since, the, hand, is, on, the, right, side, of, the, pen, right, to, left, writing, by, contrast, may, have, been, advantageous, back, when, writing, was, done, with, hammer, and, chisel, the, scribe, would, hold, the, hammer, in, their, right, hand, and, chisel, in, their, left, and, going, right, to, left, would, mean, the, hammer, was, less, likely, to, hit, the, left, hand, as, the, right, hand, had, more, control
