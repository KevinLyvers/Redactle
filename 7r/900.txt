times, the, oldest, known, classified, document, was, a, report, made, by, a, spy, disguised, as, a, diplomatic, envoy, in, the, court, of, king, hammurabi, who, died, in, around, 1750, bc, the,

world, when, spies, employed, illiterate, subjects, in, civil, services, the, thesis, that, espionage, and, intelligence, has, a, central, role, in, war, as, well, as, peace, was, first, advanced, in, the, art, of, war, and, in, the, arthashastra, in, the, middle, ages, european, states, excelled, at, what, has, later, been, termed, counter, subversion, when, catholic, inquisitions, were, staged, to, annihilate, heresy, inquisitions, were, marked, by, centrally, organised, mass, interrogations, and, detailed, record, keeping, western, espionage, changed, fundamentally, during, the, renaissance, when, italian, city, states, installed, resident, ambassadors, in, capital, cities, to, collect, intelligence, renaissance, venice, became, so, obsessed, with, espionage, that, the, council, of, ten, which, was, nominally, responsible, for, security, did, not, even, allow, the, doge, to, consult, government, archives, freely, in, 1481, the, council, of, ten, barred, all,

and, there, was, considerable, use, of, spies, on, both, sides, during, the, american, civil, war, though, not, a, spy, himself, george, washington, was, america, s, first, spymaster, utilizing, espionage, tactics, against, the, british, in, the, 20th, century, at, the, height, of, world, war, i, all, great, powers, except, the, united, states, had, elaborate, civilian, espionage, systems, and, all, national, military, establishments, had, intelligence, units, in, order, to, protect, the, country, against, foreign, agents, the, u, s, congress, passed, the, espionage, act, of, 1917,

nazi, germany, and, provided, the, allied, secret, services, with, information, that, was, very, important, for, the, war, effort, since, the, end, of, world, war, ii, the, activity, of, espionage, has, enlarged, much, of, it, growing, out, of, the, cold, war, between, the, united, states, and, the, former, ussr, the, russian, empire, and, its, successor, the, soviet, union, have, had, a, long, tradition, of, espionage, ranging, from, the, okhrana, to, the, kgb, committee, for, state, security, which, also, acted, as, a, secret, police, force, in, the, united, states, the, 1947, national, security, act, created, the, central, intelligence, agency, cia, to, coordinate, intelligence, and, the, national, security, agency, for, research, into, codes, and, electronic, communication, in, addition, to, these, the, united, states, has, 13, other, intelligence, gathering, agencies, most, of, the, u, s, expenditures, for, intelligence, gathering, are, budgeted, to, various, defense, dept, agencies, and, their, programs, under, the, intelligence, reorganization, of, 2004, the, director, of, national, intelligence, is, responsible, for, overseeing, and, coordinating, the, activities, and, budgets, of, the, u, s, intelligence, agencies, in, the, cold, war, espionage, cases, included, alger, hiss, whittaker, chambers, and, the, rosenberg, case, in, 1952, the, communist, chinese,

is, especially, effective, in, monitoring, neighboring, countries, such, as, mongolia, russia, and, india, smaller, countries, can, also, mount, effective, and, focused, espionage, efforts, for, instance, the, vietnamese, communists, had, consistently, superior, intelligence, during, the, vietnam, war, some, islamic, countries, including, libya, iran, and, syria, have, highly, developed, operations, as, well, savak, the, secret, police, of, the, pahlavi, dynasty, was, particularly, feared, by, iranian, dissidents, before, the, 1979, iranian, revolution, today, spy, agencies, target, the, illegal, drug, trade, and, terrorists, as, well, as, state, actors, intelligence, services, value, certain, intelligence, collection, techniques, over, others, the, former, soviet, union, for, example, preferred, human, sources, over, research, in, open, sources, while, the, united, states, has, tended, to, emphasize, technological, methods, such, as, sigint, and, imint, in, the, soviet, union, both, political, kgb, and, military, intelligence, gru, officers, were, judged, by, the, number, of, agents, they, recruited, espionage, agents, are, usually, trained, experts, in, a, targeted, field, so, they, can, differentiate, mundane, information, from, targets, of, value, to, their, own, organizational, development, correct, identification, of, the, target, at, its, execution, is, the, sole, purpose, of, the, espionage, operation, broad, areas, of, espionage, targeting, expertise, include, although, the, news, media, may, speak, of, spy, satellites, and, the, like, espionage, is, not, a, synonym, for, all, intelligence, gathering, disciplines, it, is, a, specific, form, of, human, source, intelligence, humint, codebreaking, cryptanalysis, or, comint, aircraft, or, satellite, photography, imint, and, analysis, of, publicly, available, data, sources, osint, are, all, intelligence, gathering, disciplines, but, none, of, them, is, considered, espionage, many, humint, activities, such, as, prisoner, interrogation, reports, from, military, reconnaissance, patrols, and, from, diplomats, etc, are, not, considered, espionage, espionage, is, the, disclosure, of, sensitive, information, classified, to, people, who, are, not, cleared, for, that, information, or, access, to, that, sensitive, information, unlike, other, forms, of, intelligence, collection, disciplines, espionage, usually, involves, accessing, the, place, where, the, desired, information, is, stored, or, accessing, the, people, who, know, the, information, and, will, divulge, it, through, some, kind, of, subterfuge, there, are, exceptions, to, physical, meetings, such, as, the, oslo, report, or, the, insistence, of, robert, hanssen, in, never, meeting, the, people, who, bought, his, information, the, us, defines, espionage, towards, itself, as, the, act, of, obtaining, delivering, transmitting, communicating, or, receiving, information, about, the, national, defence, with, an, intent, or, reason, to, believe, that, the, information, may, be, used, to, the, injury, of, the, united, states, or, to, the, advantage, of, any, foreign, nation, black, s, law, dictionary, 1990, defines, espionage, as, gathering, transmitting, or, losing, information, related, to, the, national, defense, espionage, is, a, violation, of, united, states, law, 18, u, s, c, 792, 798, and, article, 106a, of, the, uniform, code, of, military, justice, the, united, states, like, most, nations, conducts, espionage, against, other, nations, under, the, control, of, the, national, clandestine, service, britain, s, espionage, activities, are, controlled, by, the, secret, intelligence, service, source, a, spy, is, a, person, employed, to, seek, out, top, secret, information, from, a, source, within, the, united, states, intelligence, community, asset, is, more, common, usage, a, case, officer, or, special, agent, who, may, have, diplomatic, status, i, e, official, cover, or, non, official, cover, supports, and, directs, the, human, collector, cut, outs, are, couriers, who, do, not, know, the, agent, or, case, officer, but, transfer, messages, a, safe, house, is, a, refuge, for, spies, spies, often, seek, to, obtain, secret, information, from, another, source, in, larger, networks, the, organization, can, be, complex, with, many, methods, to, avoid, detection, including, clandestine, cell, systems, often, the, players, have, never, met, case, officers, are, stationed, in, foreign, countries, to, recruit, and, supervise, intelligence, agents, who, in, turn, spy, on, targets, in, the, countries, where, they, are, assigned, a, spy, need, not, be, a, citizen, of, the, target, country, and, hence, does, not, automatically, commit, treason, when, operating, within, it, while, the, more, common, practice, is, to, recruit, a, person, already, trusted, with, access, to, sensitive, information, sometimes, a, person, with, a, well, prepared, synthetic, identity, cover, background, called, a, legend, in, tradecraft, may, attempt, to, infiltrate, a, target, organization, these, agents, can, be, moles, who, are, recruited, before, they, get, access, to, secrets, defectors, who, are, recruited, after, they, get, access, to, secrets, and, leave, their, country, or, defectors, in, place, who, get, access, but, do, not, leave, a, legend, is, also, employed, for, an, individual, who, is, not, an, illegal, agent, but, is, an, ordinary, citizen, who, is, relocated, for, example, a, protected, witness, nevertheless, such, a, non, agent, very, likely, will, also, have, a, case, officer, who, will, act, as, a, controller, as, in, most, if, not, all, synthetic, identity, schemes, for, whatever, purpose, illegal, or, legal, the, assistance, of, a, controller, is, required, spies, may, also, be, used, to, spread, disinformation, in, the, organization, in, which, they, are, planted, such, as, giving, false, reports, about, their, country, s, military, movements, or, about, a, competing, company, s, ability, to, bring, a, product, to, market, spies, may, be, given, other, roles, that, also, require, infiltration, such, as, sabotage, many, governments, spy, on, their, allies, as, well, as, their, enemies, although, they, typically, maintain, a, policy, of, not, commenting, on, this, governments, also, employ, private, companies, to, collect, information, on, their, behalf, such, as, scg, international, risk, international, intelligence, limited, and, others, many, organizations, both, national, and, non, national, conduct, espionage, operations, it, should, not, be, assumed, that, espionage, is, always, directed, at, the, most, secret, operations, of, a, target, country, national, and, terrorist, organizations, and, other, groups, are, also, targeted, this, is, because, governments, want, to, retrieve, information, that, they, can, use, to, be, proactive, in, protecting, their, nation, from, potential, terrorist, attacks, communications, both, are, necessary, to, espionage, and, clandestine, operations, and, also, a, great, vulnerability, when, the, adversary, has, sophisticated, sigint, detection, and,

agent, is, the, person, who, does, the, spying, they, may, be, a, citizen, of, a, country, recruited, by, that, country, to, spy, on, another, a, citizen, of, a, country, recruited, by, that, country, to, carry, out, false, flag, assignments, disrupting, his, own, country, a, citizen, of, one, country, who, is, recruited, by, a, second, country, to, spy, on, or, work, against, his, own, country, or, a, third, country, and, more, in, popular, usage, this, term, is, sometimes, confused, with, an, intelligence, officer, intelligence, operative, or, case, officer, who, recruits, and, handles,

nations, in, the, united, states, it, is, covered, by, the, espionage, act, of, 1917, the, risks, of, espionage, vary, a, spy, violating, the, host, country, s, laws, may, be, deported, imprisoned, or, even, executed, a, spy, violating, its, own, country, s, laws, can, be, imprisoned, for, espionage, or, and, treason, which, in, the, united, states, and, some, other, jurisdictions, can, only, occur, if, they, take, up, arms, or, aids, the, enemy, against, their, own, country, during, wartime, or, even, executed, as, the, rosenbergs, were, for, example, when, aldrich, ames, handed, a, stack, of, dossiers, of, u, s, central, intelligence, agency, cia, agents, in, the, eastern, bloc, to, his, kgb, officer, handler, the, kgb, rolled, up, several, networks, and, at, least, ten, people, were, secretly, shot, when, ames, was, arrested, by, the, u, s, federal, bureau, of, investigation, fbi, he, faced, life, in, prison, his, contact, who, had, diplomatic, immunity, was, declared, persona, non, grata, and, taken, to, the, airport, ames, wife, was, threatened, with, life, imprisonment, if, her, husband, did, not, cooperate, he, did, and, she, was, given, a, five, year, sentence, hugh, francis, redmond, a, cia, officer, in, china, spent, nineteen, years, in, a, chinese, prison, for, espionage, and, died, there, as, he, was, operating, without, diplomatic, cover, and, immunity, in, united, states, law, treason, espionage, and, spying, are, separate, crimes, treason, and, espionage, have, graduated, punishment, levels, the, united, states, in, world, war, i, passed, the, espionage, act, of, 1917, over, the, years, many, spies, such, as, the, soble, spy, ring, robert, lee, johnson, the, rosenberg, ring, aldrich, hazen, ames, robert, philip, hanssen, jonathan, pollard, john, anthony, walker, james, hall, iii, and, others, have, been, prosecuted, under, this, law, from, ancient, times, the, penalty, for, espionage, in, many, countries, was, execution, this, was, true, right, up, until, the, era, of, world, war, ii, for, example, josef, jakobs, was, a, nazi, spy, who, parachuted, into, great, britain, in, 1941, and, was, executed, for, espionage, in, modern, times, many, people, convicted, of, espionage, have, been, given, penal, sentences, rather, than, execution, for, example, aldrich, hazen, ames, is, an, american, cia, analyst, turned, kgb, mole, who, was, convicted, of, espionage, in, 1994, he, is, serving, a, life, sentence, without, the, possibility, of, parole, in, the, high, security, allenwood, u, s, penitentiary, ames, was, formerly, a, 31, year, cia, counterintelligence, officer, and, analyst, who, committed, espionage, against, his, country, by, spying, for, the, soviet, union, and, russia, so, far, as, it, is, known, ames, compromised, the, second, largest, number, of, cia, agents, second, only, to, robert, hanssen, who, also, served, a, prison, sentence, until, his, death, in, 2023, espionage, laws, are, also, used, to, prosecute, non, spies, in, the, united, states, the, espionage, act, of, 1917, was, used, against, socialist, politician, eugene, v, debs, at, that, time, the, act, had, much, stricter, guidelines, and, amongst, other, things, banned, speech, against, military, recruiting, the, law, was, later, used, to, suppress, publication, of, periodicals, for, example, of, father, coughlin, in, world, war, ii, in, the, early, 21st, century, the, act, was, used, to, prosecute, whistleblowers, such, as, thomas, andrews, drake, john, kiriakou, and, edward, snowden, as, well, as, officials, who, communicated, with, journalists, for, innocuous, reasons, such, as, stephen, jin, woo, kim, as, of, 2012, india, and, pakistan, were, holding, several, hundred, prisoners, of, each, other, s, country, for, minor, violations, like, trespass, or, visa, overstay, often, with, accusations, of, espionage, attached, some, of, these, include, cases, where, pakistan, and, india, both, deny, citizenship, to, these, people, leaving, them, stateless, the, bbc, reported, in, 2012, on, one, such, case, that, of, mohammed, idrees, who, was, held, under, indian, police, control, for, approximately, 13, years, for, overstaying, his, 15, day, visa, by, 2, 3, days, after, seeing, his, ill, parents, in, 1999, much, of, the, 13, years, were, spent, in, prison, waiting, for, a, hearing, and, more, time, was, spent, homeless, or, living, with, generous, families, the, indian, people, s, union, for, civil, liberties, and, human, rights, law, network, both, decried, his, treatment, the, bbc, attributed, some, of, the, problems, to, tensions, caused, by, the, kashmir, conflict, espionage, is, illegal, in, the, uk, under, the, national, security, act, 2023, which, repealed, prior, official, secrets, acts, and, creates, three, separate, offences, for, espionage, a, person, is, liable, to, be, imprisoned, for, life, for, committing, an, offence, under, section, 1, of, the, act, or, 14, years, for, an, offence, under, sections, 2, and, 3, government, intelligence, is, very, much, distinct, from, espionage, and, is, not, illegal, in, the, uk, providing, that, the, organisations, of, individuals, are, registered, often, with, the, ico, and, are, acting, within, the, restrictions, of, the, regulation, of, investigatory, powers, act, ripa, intelligence, is, considered, legally, as, information, of, all, sorts, gathered, by, a, government, or, organisation, to, guide, its, decisions, it, includes, information, that, may, be, both, public, and, private, obtained, from, much, different, public, or, secret, sources, it, could, consist, entirely, of, information, from, either, publicly, available, or, secret, sources, or, be, a, combination, of, the, two, however, espionage, and, intelligence, can, be, linked, according, to, the, mi5, website, foreign, intelligence, officers, acting, in, the, uk, under, diplomatic, cover, may, enjoy, immunity, from, prosecution, such, persons, can, only, be, tried, for, spying, or, indeed, any, criminal, offence, if, diplomatic, immunity, is, waived, beforehand, those, officers, operating, without, diplomatic, cover, have, no, such, immunity, from, prosecution, there, are, also, laws, surrounding, government, and, organisational, intelligence, and, surveillance, generally, the, body, involved, should, be, issued, with, some, form, of, warrant, or, permission, from, the, government, and, should, be, enacting, their, procedures, in, the, interest, of, protecting, national, security, or, the, safety, of, public, citizens, those, carrying, out, intelligence, missions, should, act, within, not, only, ripa, but, also, the, data, protection, act, and, human, rights, act, however, there, are, spy, equipment, laws, and, legal, requirements, around, intelligence, methods, that, vary, for, each, form, of, intelligence, enacted, in, war, espionage, is, considered, permissible, as, many, nations, recognize, the, inevitability, of, opposing, sides, seeking, intelligence, each, about, the, dispositions, of, the, other, to, make, the, mission, easier, and, successful, combatants, wear, disguises, to, conceal, their, true, identity, from, the, enemy, while, penetrating, enemy, lines, for, intelligence, gathering, however, if, they, are, caught, behind, enemy, lines, in, disguises, they, are, not, entitled, to, prisoner, of, war, status, and, subject, to, prosecution, and, punishment, including, execution, the, hague, convention, of, 1907, addresses, the, status, of, wartime, spies, specifically, within, laws, and, customs, of, war, on, land, hague, iv, october, 18, 1907, chapter, ii, spies, article, 29, states, that, a, person, is, considered, a, spy, who, acts, clandestinely, or, on, false, pretences, infiltrates, enemy, lines, with, the, intention, of, acquiring, intelligence, about, the, enemy, and, communicate, it, to, the, belligerent, during, times, of, war, soldiers, who, penetrate, enemy, lines, in, proper, uniforms, for, the, purpose, of, acquiring, intelligence, are, not, considered, spies, but, are, lawful, combatants, entitled, to, be, treated, as, prisoners, of, war, upon, capture, by, the, enemy, article, 30, states, that, a, spy, captured, behind, enemy, lines, may, only, be, punished, following, a, trial, however, article, 31, provides, that, if, a, spy, successfully, rejoined, his, own, military, and, is, then, captured, by, the, enemy, as, a, lawful, combatant, he, cannot, be, punished, for, his, previous, acts, of, espionage, and, must, be, treated, as, a, prisoner, of, war, this, provision, does, not, apply, to, citizens, who, committed, treason, against, their, own, country, or, co, belligerents, of, that, country, and, may, be, captured, and, prosecuted, at, any, place, or, any, time, regardless, whether, he, rejoined, the, military, to, which, he, belongs, or, not, or, during, or, after, the, war, the, ones, that, are, excluded, from, being, treated, as, spies, while, behind, enemy, lines, are, escaping, prisoners, of, war, and, downed, airmen, as, international, law, distinguishes, between, a, disguised, spy, and, a, disguised, escaper, it, is, permissible, for, these, groups, to, wear, enemy, uniforms, or, civilian, clothes, in, order, to, facilitate, their, escape, back, to, friendly, lines, so, long, as, they, do, not, attack, enemy, forces, collect, military, intelligence, or, engage, in, similar, military, operations, while, so, disguised, soldiers, who, are, wearing, enemy, uniforms, or, civilian, clothes, simply, for, the, sake, of, warmth, along, with, other, purposes, rather, than, engaging, in, espionage, or, similar, military, operations, while, so, attired, are, also, excluded, from, being, treated, as, unlawful, combatants, saboteurs, are, treated, as, spies, as, they, too, wear, disguises, behind, enemy, lines, for, the, purpose, of, waging, destruction, on, an, enemy, s, vital, targets, in, addition, to, intelligence, gathering, for, example, during, world, war, ii, eight, german, agents, entered, the, u, s, in, june, 1942, as, part, of, operation, pastorius, a, sabotage, mission, against, u, s, economic, targets, two, weeks, later, all, were, arrested, in, civilian, clothes, by, the, fbi, thanks, to, two, german, agents, betraying, the, mission, to, the, u, s, under, the, hague, convention, of, 1907, these, germans, were, classified, as, spies, and, tried, by, a, military, tribunal, in, washington, d, c, on, august, 3, 1942, all, eight, were, found, guilty, and, sentenced, to, death,
