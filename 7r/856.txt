sexism, is, prejudice, or, discrimination, based, on, one, s, sex, or, gender, sexism, can, affect, anyone, but, primarily, affects, women, and, girls, it, has, been, linked, to, gender, roles, and, stereotypes, and, may, include, the, belief, that, one, sex, or, gender, is, intrinsically, superior, to, another, extreme, sexism, may, foster, sexual, harassment, rape, and, other, forms, of, sexual, violence, discrimination, in, this, context, is, defined, as, discrimination, toward, people, based, on, their, gender, identity, or, their, gender, or, sex, differences, an, example, of, this, is, workplace, inequality, sexism, refers, to, violation, of, equal, opportunities, formal, equality, based, on, gender, or, refers, to, violation, of, equality, of, outcomes, based, on, gender, also, called, substantive, equality, sexism, may, arise, from, social, or, cultural, customs, and, norms, according, to, legal, scholar, fred, r, shapiro, the, term, sexism, was, most, likely, coined, on, november, 18, 1965, by, pauline, m, leet, during, a, student, faculty, forum, at, franklin, and, marshall, college, specifically, the, word, sexism, appears, in, leet, s, forum, contribution, women, and, the, undergraduate, and, she, defines, it, by, comparing, it, to, racism, stating, in, part, when, you, argue, that, since, fewer, women, write, good, poetry, this, justifies, their, total, exclusion, you, are, taking, a, position, analogous, to, that, of, the, racist, i, might, call, you, in, this, case, a, sexist, both, the, racist, and, the, sexist, are, acting, as, if, all, that, has, happened, had, never, happened, and, both, of, them, are, making, decisions, and, coming, to, conclusions, about, someone, s, value, by, referring, to, factors, which, are, in, both, cases, irrelevant, according, to, the, oxford, english, dictionary, the, first, time, the, term, sexism, appeared, in, print, was, in, caroline, bird, s, speech, on, being, born, female, which, was, delivered, before, the, episcopal, church, executive, council, in, greenwich, connecticut, and, subsequently, published, on, november, 15, 1968, in, vital, speeches, of, the, day, p, 6, sexism, may, be, defined, as, an, ideology, based, on, the, belief, that, one, sex, is, superior, to, another, it, is, discrimination, prejudice, or, stereotyping, based, on, gender, and, is, most, often, expressed, toward, women, and, girls, sociology, has, examined, sexism, as, manifesting, at, both, the, individual, and, the, institutional, level, according, to, richard, schaefer, sexism, is, perpetuated, by, all, major, social, institutions, sociologists, describe, parallels, among, other, ideological, systems, of, oppression, such, as, racism, which, also, operates, at, both, the, individual, and, institutional, level, early, female, sociologists, charlotte, perkins, gilman, ida, b, wells, and, harriet, martineau, described, systems, of, gender, inequality, but, did, not, use, the, term, sexism, which, was, coined, later, sociologists, who, adopted, the, functionalist, paradigm, e, g, talcott, parsons, understood, gender, inequality, as, the, natural, outcome, of, a, dimorphic, model, of, gender, psychologists, mary, crawford, and, rhoda, unger, define, sexism, as, prejudice, held, by, individuals, that, encompasses, negative, attitudes, and, values, about, women, as, a, group, peter, glick, and, susan, fiske, coined, the, term, ambivalent, sexism, to, describe, how, stereotypes, about, women, can, be, both, positive, and, negative, and, that, individuals, compartmentalize, the, stereotypes, they, hold, into, hostile, sexism, or, benevolent, sexism, feminist, author, bell, hooks, defines, sexism, as, a, system, of, oppression, that, results, in, disadvantages, for, women, feminist, philosopher, marilyn, frye, defines, sexism, as, an, attitudinal, conceptual, cognitive, orientational, complex, of, male, supremacy, male, chauvinism, and, misogyny, philosopher, kate, manne, defines, sexism, as, one, branch, of, a, patriarchal, order, in, her, definition, sexism, rationalizes, and, justifies, patriarchal, norms, in, contrast, with, misogyny, the, branch, which, polices, and, enforces, patriarchal, norms, manne, says, that, sexism, often, attempts, to, make, patriarchal, social, arrangements, seem, natural, good, or, inevitable, so, that, there, appears, to, be, no, reason, to, resist, them, evidence, is, lacking, to, support, the, idea, that, many, pre, agricultural, societies, afforded, women, a, higher, status, than, women, today, however, historians, are, reasonably, sure, that, women, had, roughly, equal, social, power, to, men, in, many, such, societies, after, the, adoption, of, agriculture, and, sedentary, cultures, the, concept, that, one, gender, was, inferior, to, the, other, was, established, most, often, this, was, imposed, upon, women, and, girls, the, status, of, women, in, ancient, egypt, depended, on, their, fathers, or, husbands, but, they, had, property, rights, and, could, attend, court, including, as, plaintiffs, examples, of, unequal, treatment, of, women, in, the, ancient, world, include, written, laws, preventing, women, from, participating, in, the, political, process, for, instance, women, in, ancient, rome, could, not, vote, or, hold, political, office, another, example, is, scholarly, texts, that, indoctrinate, children, in, female, inferiority, women, in, ancient, china, were, taught, the, confucian, principles, that, a, woman, should, obey, her, father, in, childhood, husband, in, marriage, and, son, in, widowhood, on, the, other, hand, women, of, the, anglo, saxon, era, were, commonly, afforded, equal, status, sexism, may, have, been, the, impetus, that, fueled, the, witch, trials, between, the, 15th, and, 18th, centuries, in, early, modern, europe, and, in, the, european, colonies, in, north, america, claims, were, made, that, witches, were, a, threat, to, christendom, the, misogyny, of, that, period, played, a, role, in, the, persecution, of, these, women, in, malleus, maleficarum, by, heinrich, kramer, the, book, which, played, a, major, role, in, the, witch, hunts, and, trials, the, author, argues, that, women, are, more, likely, to, practice, witchcraft, than, men, and, writes, that, witchcraft, remains, illegal, in, several, countries, including, saudi, arabia, where, it, is, punishable, by, death, in, 2011, a, woman, was, beheaded, in, that, country, for, witchcraft, and, sorcery, murders, of, women, after, being, accused, of, witchcraft, remain, common, in, some, parts, of, the, world, for, example, in, tanzania, about, 500, elderly, women, are, murdered, each, year, following, such, accusations, when, women, are, targeted, with, accusations, of, witchcraft, and, subsequent, violence, it, is, often, the, case, that, several, forms, of, discrimination, interact, for, example, discrimination, based, on, gender, with, discrimination, based, on, caste, as, is, the, case, in, india, and, nepal, where, such, crimes, are, relatively, common, until, the, 20th, century, u, s, and, english, law, observed, the, system, of, coverture, where, by, marriage, the, husband, and, wife, are, one, person, in, law, that, is, the, very, being, or, legal, existence, of, the, woman, is, suspended, during, the, marriage, u, s, women, were, not, legally, defined, as, persons, until, 1875, minor, v, happersett, 88, u, s, 162, a, similar, legal, doctrine, called, marital, power, existed, under, roman, dutch, law, and, is, still, partially, in, force, in, present, day, eswatini, restrictions, on, married, women, s, rights, were, common, in, western, countries, until, a, few, decades, ago, for, instance, french, married, women, obtained, the, right, to, work, without, their, husband, s, permission, in, 1965, and, in, west, germany, women, obtained, this, right, in, 1977, during, the, franco, era, in, spain, a, married, woman, required, her, husband, s, consent, called, permiso, marital, for, employment, ownership, of, property, and, traveling, away, from, home, the, permiso, marital, was, abolished, in, 1975, in, australia, until, 1983, a, married, woman, s, passport, application, had, to, be, authorized, by, her, husband, women, in, parts, of, the, world, continue, to, lose, their, legal, rights, in, marriage, for, example, yemeni, marriage, regulations, state, that, a, wife, must, obey, her, husband, and, must, not, leave, home, without, his, permission, in, iraq, the, law, allows, husbands, to, legally, punish, their, wives, in, the, democratic, republic, of, congo, the, family, code, states, that, the, husband, is, the, head, of, the, household, the, wife, owes, her, obedience, to, her, husband, a, wife, has, to, live, with, her, husband, wherever, he, chooses, to, live, and, wives, must, have, their, husbands, authorization, to, bring, a, case, in, court, or, initiate, other, legal, proceedings, abuses, and, discriminatory, practices, against, women, in, marriage, are, often, rooted, in, financial, payments, such, as, dowry, bride, price, and, dower, these, transactions, often, serve, as, legitimizing, coercive, control, of, the, wife, by, her, husband, and, in, giving, him, authority, over, her, for, instance, article, 13, of, the, code, of, personal, status, tunisia, states, that, the, husband, shall, not, in, default, of, payment, of, the, dower, force, the, woman, to, consummate, the, marriage, implying, that, if, the, dower, is, paid, marital, rape, is, permitted, in, this, regard, critics, have, questioned, the, alleged, gains, of, women, in, tunisia, and, its, image, as, a, progressive, country, in, the, region, arguing, that, discrimination, against, women, remains, very, strong, there, the, world, organisation, against, torture, omct, has, recognized, the, independence, and, ability, to, leave, an, abusive, husband, as, crucial, in, stopping, mistreatment, of, women, however, in, some, parts, of, the, world, once, married, women, have, very, little, chance, of, leaving, a, violent, husband, obtaining, a, divorce, is, very, difficult, in, many, jurisdictions, because, of, the, need, to, prove, fault, in, court, while, attempting, a, de, facto, separation, moving, away, from, the, marital, home, is, also, impossible, because, of, laws, preventing, this, for, instance, in, afghanistan, a, wife, who, leaves, her, marital, home, risks, being, imprisoned, for, running, away, in, addition, many, former, british, colonies, including, india, maintain, the, concept, of, restitution, of, conjugal, rights, under, which, a, wife, may, be, ordered, by, court, to, return, to, her, husband, if, she, fails, to, do, so, she, may, be, held, in, contempt, of, court, other, problems, have, to, do, with, the, payment, of, the, bride, price, if, the, wife, wants, to, leave, her, husband, may, demand, the, return, of, the, bride, price, that, he, had, paid, to, the, woman, s, family, and, the, woman, s, family, often, cannot, or, does, not, want, to, pay, it, back, laws, regulations, and, traditions, related, to, marriage, continue, to, discriminate, against, women, in, many, parts, of, the, world, and, to, contribute, to, the, mistreatment, of, women, in, particular, in, areas, related, to, sexual, violence, and, to, self, determination, regarding, sexuality, the, violation, of, the, latter, now, being, acknowledged, as, a, violation, of, women, s, rights, in, 2012, navi, pillay, then, high, commissioner, for, human, rights, stated, that, women, are, frequently, treated, as, property, they, are, sold, into, marriage, into, trafficking, into, sexual, slavery, violence, against, women, frequently, takes, the, form, of, sexual, violence, victims, of, such, violence, are, often, accused, of, promiscuity, and, held, responsible, for, their, fate, while, infertile, women, are, rejected, by, husbands, families, and, communities, in, many, countries, married, women, may, not, refuse, to, have, sexual, relations, with, their, husbands, and, often, have, no, say, in, whether, they, use, contraception, ensuring, that, women, have, full, autonomy, over, their, bodies, is, the, first, crucial, step, towards, achieving, substantive, equality, between, women, and, men, personal, issues, such, as, when, how, and, with, whom, they, choose, to, have, sex, and, when, how, and, with, whom, they, choose, to, have, children, are, at, the, heart, of, living, a, life, in, dignity, gender, has, been, used, as, a, tool, for, discrimination, against, women, in, the, political, sphere, women, s, suffrage, was, not, achieved, until, 1893, when, new, zealand, was, the, first, country, to, grant, women, the, right, to, vote, saudi, arabia, is, the, most, recent, country, as, of, august, 2015, to, extend, the, right, to, vote, to, women, in, 2011, some, western, countries, allowed, women, the, right, to, vote, only, relatively, recently, swiss, women, gained, the, right, to, vote, in, federal, elections, in, 1971, and, appenzell, innerrhoden, became, the, last, canton, to, grant, women, the, right, to, vote, on, local, issues, in, 1991, when, it, was, forced, to, do, so, by, the, federal, supreme, court, of, switzerland, french, women, were, granted, the, right, to, vote, in, 1944, in, greece, women, obtained, the, right, to, vote, in, 1952, in, liechtenstein, women, obtained, the, right, to, vote, in, 1984, through, the, women, s, suffrage, referendum, of, 1984, while, almost, every, woman, today, has, the, right, to, vote, there, is, still, progress, to, be, made, for, women, in, politics, studies, have, shown, that, in, several, democracies, including, australia, canada, and, the, united, states, women, are, still, represented, using, gender, stereotypes, in, the, press, multiple, authors, have, shown, that, gender, differences, in, the, media, are, less, evident, today, than, they, used, to, be, in, the, 1980s, but, are, still, present, certain, issues, e, g, education, are, likely, to, be, linked, with, female, candidates, while, other, issues, e, g, taxes, are, likely, to, be, linked, with, male, candidates, in, addition, there, is, more, emphasis, on, female, candidates, personal, qualities, such, as, their, appearance, and, their, personality, as, females, are, portrayed, as, emotional, and, dependent, there, is, a, widespread, imbalance, of, lawmaking, power, between, men, and, women, the, ratio, of, women, to, men, in, legislatures, is, used, as, a, measure, of, gender, equality, in, the, united, nations, gender, empowerment, measure, and, its, newer, incarnation, the, gender, inequality, index, speaking, about, china, lanyan, chen, stated, that, since, men, more, than, women, serve, as, the, gatekeepers, of, policy, making, this, may, lead, to, women, s, needs, not, being, properly, represented, in, this, sense, the, inequality, in, lawmaking, power, also, causes, gender, discrimination, until, the, early, 1980s, some, high, end, restaurants, had, two, menus, a, regular, menu, with, the, prices, listed, for, men, and, a, second, menu, for, women, which, did, not, have, the, prices, listed, it, was, called, the, ladies, menu, so, that, the, female, diner, would, not, know, the, prices, of, the, items, in, 1980, kathleen, bick, took, a, male, business, partner, out, to, dinner, at, l, orangerie, in, west, hollywood, after, she, was, given, a, women, s, menu, without, prices, and, her, guest, got, one, with, prices, bick, hired, lawyer, gloria, allred, to, file, a, discrimination, lawsuit, on, the, grounds, that, the, women, s, menu, went, against, the, california, civil, rights, act, bick, stated, that, getting, a, women, s, menu, without, prices, left, her, feeling, humiliated, and, incensed, the, owners, of, the, restaurant, defended, the, practice, saying, it, was, done, as, a, courtesy, like, the, way, men, would, stand, up, when, a, woman, enters, the, room, even, though, the, lawsuit, was, dropped, the, restaurant, ended, its, gender, based, menu, policy, a, 2021, study, found, little, evidence, that, levels, of, sexism, had, changed, from, 2004, to, 2018, in, the, united, states, gender, stereotypes, are, widely, held, beliefs, about, the, characteristics, and, behavior, of, women, and, men, empirical, studies, have, found, widely, shared, cultural, beliefs, that, men, are, more, socially, valued, and, more, competent, than, women, in, a, number, of, activities, dustin, b, thoman, and, others, 2008, hypothesize, that, he, socio, cultural, salience, of, ability, versus, other, components, of, the, gender, math, stereotype, may, impact, women, pursuing, math, through, the, experiment, comparing, the, math, outcomes, of, women, under, two, various, gender, math, stereotype, components, which, are, the, ability, of, math, and, the, effort, on, math, respectively, thoman, and, others, found, that, women, s, math, performance, is, more, likely, to, be, affected, by, the, negative, ability, stereotype, which, is, influenced, by, sociocultural, beliefs, in, the, united, states, rather, than, the, effort, component, as, a, result, of, this, experiment, and, the, sociocultural, beliefs, in, the, united, states, thoman, and, others, concluded, that, individuals, academic, outcomes, can, be, affected, by, the, gender, math, stereotype, component, that, is, influenced, by, the, sociocultural, beliefs, sexism, in, language, exists, when, language, devalues, members, of, a, certain, gender, sexist, language, in, many, instances, promotes, male, superiority, sexism, in, language, affects, consciousness, perceptions, of, reality, encoding, and, transmitting, cultural, meanings, and, socialization, researchers, have, pointed, to, the, semantic, rule, in, operation, in, language, of, the, male, as, norm, this, results, in, sexism, as, the, male, becomes, the, standard, and, those, who, are, not, male, are, relegated, to, the, inferior, sexism, in, language, is, considered, a, form, of, indirect, sexism, because, it, is, not, always, overt, examples, include, various, 20th, century, feminist, movements, from, liberal, feminism, and, radical, feminism, to, standpoint, feminism, postmodern, feminism, and, queer, theory, have, considered, language, in, their, theorizing, most, of, these, theories, have, maintained, a, critical, stance, on, language, that, calls, for, a, change, in, the, way, speakers, use, their, language, one, of, the, most, common, calls, is, for, gender, neutral, language, many, have, called, attention, however, to, the, fact, that, the, english, language, is, not, inherently, sexist, in, its, linguistic, system, but, the, way, it, is, used, becomes, sexist, and, gender, neutral, language, could, thus, be, employed, romanic, languages, such, as, french, and, spanish, may, be, seen, as, reinforcing, sexism, in, that, the, masculine, form, is, the, default, the, word, mademoiselle, meaning, miss, was, declared, banished, from, french, administrative, forms, in, 2012, by, prime, minister, fran, ois, fillon, current, pressure, calls, for, the, use, of, the, masculine, plural, pronoun, as, the, default, in, a, mixed, sex, group, to, change, as, for, spanish, mexico, s, ministry, of, the, interior, published, a, guide, on, how, to, reduce, the, use, of, sexist, language, german, speakers, have, also, raised, questions, about, how, sexism, intersects, with, grammar, the, german, language, is, heavily, inflected, for, gender, number, and, case, nearly, all, nouns, denoting, the, occupations, or, statuses, of, human, beings, are, gender, differentiated, for, more, gender, neutral, constructions, gerund, nouns, are, sometimes, used, instead, as, this, eliminates, the, grammatical, gender, distinction, in, the, plural, and, significantly, reduces, it, in, the, singular, for, example, instead, of, die, studenten, the, men, students, or, die, studentinnen, the, women, students, one, writes, die, studierenden, the, studying, however, this, approach, introduces, an, element, of, ambiguity, because, gerund, nouns, more, precisely, denote, one, currently, engaged, in, the, activity, rather, than, one, who, routinely, engages, in, it, as, their, primary, occupation, in, chinese, some, writers, have, pointed, to, sexism, inherent, in, the, structure, of, written, characters, for, example, the, character, for, man, is, linked, to, those, for, positive, qualities, like, courage, and, effect, while, the, character, for, wife, is, composed, of, a, female, part, and, a, broom, considered, of, low, worth, gender, specific, pejorative, terms, intimidate, or, harm, another, person, because, of, their, gender, sexism, can, be, expressed, in, language, with, negative, gender, oriented, implications, such, as, condescension, for, example, one, may, refer, to, a, female, as, a, girl, rather, than, a, woman, implying, that, she, is, subordinate, or, not, fully, mature, other, examples, include, obscene, language, some, words, are, offensive, to, transgender, people, including, tranny, she, male, or, he, she, intentional, misgendering, assigning, the, wrong, gender, to, someone, and, the, pronoun, it, are, also, considered, pejorative, the, practice, of, using, first, names, for, individuals, from, a, profession, that, is, predominantly, female, occurs, in, health, care, physicians, are, typically, referred, to, using, their, last, name, but, nurses, are, referred, to, even, by, physicians, they, do, not, know, by, their, first, name, according, to, suzanne, gordon, a, typical, conversation, between, a, physician, and, a, nurse, is, hello, jane, i, m, dr, smith, would, you, hand, me, the, patient, s, chart, nursing, against, the, odds, how, health, care, cost, cutting, media, stereotypes, and, medical, hubris, undermine, nurses, and, patient, care, occupational, sexism, refers, to, discriminatory, practices, statements, or, actions, based, on, a, person, s, sex, occurring, in, the, workplace, one, form, of, occupational, sexism, is, wage, discrimination, in, 2008, the, organisation, for, economic, co, operation, and, development, oecd, found, that, while, female, employment, rates, have, expanded, and, gender, employment, and, wage, gaps, have, narrowed, nearly, everywhere, on, average, women, still, have, 20, less, chance, to, have, a, job, and, are, paid, 17, less, than, men, the, report, stated, many, countries, labour, market, discrimination, i, e, the, unequal, treatment, of, equally, productive, individuals, only, because, they, belong, to, a, specific, group, is, still, a, crucial, factor, inflating, disparities, in, employment, and, the, quality, of, job, opportunities, evidence, presented, in, this, edition, of, the, employment, outlook, suggests, that, about, 8, percent, of, the, variation, in, gender, employment, gaps, and, 30, percent, of, the, variation, in, gender, wage, gaps, across, oecd, countries, can, be, explained, by, discriminatory, practices, in, the, labor, market, it, also, found, that, although, almost, all, oecd, countries, including, the, u, s, have, established, anti, discrimination, laws, these, laws, are, difficult, to, enforce, women, who, enter, predominantly, male, work, groups, can, experience, the, negative, consequences, of, tokenism, performance, pressures, social, isolation, and, role, encapsulation, tokenism, could, be, used, to, camouflage, sexism, to, preserve, male, workers, advantage, in, the, workplace, no, link, exists, between, the, proportion, of, women, working, in, an, organization, company, and, the, improvement, of, their, working, conditions, ignoring, sexist, issues, may, exacerbate, women, s, occupational, problems, in, the, world, values, survey, of, 2005, responders, were, asked, if, they, thought, wage, work, should, be, restricted, to, men, only, in, iceland, the, percentage, that, agreed, was, 3, 6, whereas, in, egypt, it, was, 94, 9, research, has, repeatedly, shown, that, mothers, in, the, united, states, are, less, likely, to, be, hired, than, equally, qualified, fathers, and, if, hired, receive, a, lower, salary, than, male, applicants, with, children, one, study, found, that, female, applicants, were, favored, however, its, results, have, been, met, with, skepticism, from, other, researchers, since, it, contradicts, most, other, studies, on, the, issue, joan, c, williams, a, distinguished, professor, at, the, university, of, california, s, hastings, college, of, law, raised, issues, with, its, methodology, pointing, out, that, the, fictional, female, candidates, it, used, were, unusually, well, qualified, studies, using, more, moderately, qualified, graduate, students, have, found, that, male, students, are, much, more, likely, to, be, hired, offered, better, salaries, and, offered, mentorship, in, europe, studies, based, on, field, experiments, in, the, labor, market, provide, evidence, for, no, severe, levels, of, discrimination, based, on, female, gender, however, unequal, treatment, is, still, measured, in, particular, situations, for, instance, when, candidates, apply, for, positions, at, a, higher, functional, level, in, belgium, when, they, apply, at, their, fertile, ages, in, france, and, when, they, apply, for, male, dominated, occupations, in, austria, studies, have, concluded, that, on, average, women, earn, lower, wages, than, men, worldwide, some, people, argue, that, this, results, from, widespread, gender, discrimination, in, the, workplace, others, argue, that, the, wage, gap, results, from, different, choices, by, men, and, women, such, as, women, placing, more, value, than, men, on, having, children, and, men, being, more, likely, than, women, to, choose, careers, in, high, paying, fields, such, as, business, engineering, and, technology, eurostat, found, a, persistent, average, gender, pay, gap, of, 27, 5, in, the, 27, eu, member, states, in, 2008, similarly, the, oecd, found, that, female, full, time, employees, earned, 27, less, than, their, male, counterparts, in, oecd, countries, in, 2009, in, the, united, states, the, female, to, male, earnings, ratio, was, 0, 77, in, 2009, female, full, time, year, round, ftyr, workers, earned, 77, as, much, as, male, ftyr, workers, women, s, earnings, relative, to, men, s, fell, from, 1960, to, 1980, 56, 7, 54, 2, rose, rapidly, from, 1980, to, 1990, 54, 2, 67, 6, leveled, off, from, 1990, to, 2000, 67, 6, 71, 2, and, rose, from, 2000, to, 2009, 71, 2, 77, 0, as, of, the, late, 2010s, it, has, decreased, back, to, around, 1990, to, 2000, levels, 68, 6, 71, 1, when, the, first, equal, pay, act, was, passed, in, 1963, female, full, time, workers, earned, 48, 9, as, much, as, male, full, time, workers, research, conducted, in, czechia, and, slovakia, shows, that, even, after, the, governments, passed, anti, discrimination, legislation, two, thirds, of, the, gender, gap, in, wages, remained, unexplained, and, segregation, continued, to, represent, a, major, source, of, the, gap, the, gender, gap, can, also, vary, across, occupation, and, within, occupation, in, taiwan, for, example, studies, show, how, the, bulk, of, gender, wage, discrepancies, occur, within, occupation, in, russia, research, shows, that, the, gender, wage, gap, is, distributed, unevenly, across, income, levels, and, that, it, mainly, occurs, at, the, lower, end, of, income, distribution, the, research, also, found, that, wage, arrears, and, payment, in, kind, attenuated, wage, discrimination, particularly, amongst, the, lowest, paid, workers, suggesting, that, russian, enterprise, managers, assigned, lowest, importance, to, equity, considerations, when, allocating, these, forms, of, payment, the, gender, pay, gap, has, been, attributed, to, differences, in, personal, and, workplace, characteristics, between, men, and, women, such, as, education, hours, worked, and, occupation, innate, behavioral, and, biological, differences, between, men, and, women, and, discrimination, in, the, labor, market, such, as, gender, stereotypes, and, customer, and, employer, bias, women, take, significantly, more, time, off, to, raise, children, than, men, in, certain, countries, such, as, south, korea, it, has, also, been, a, long, established, practice, to, lay, off, female, employees, upon, marriage, a, study, by, professor, linda, c, babcock, in, her, book, women, don, t, ask, shows, that, men, are, eight, times, more, likely, to, ask, for, a, pay, raise, suggesting, that, pay, inequality, may, be, partly, a, result, of, behavioral, differences, between, the, sexes, however, studies, generally, find, that, a, portion, of, the, gender, pay, gap, remains, unexplained, after, accounting, for, factors, assumed, to, influence, earnings, the, unexplained, portion, of, the, wage, gap, is, attributed, to, gender, discrimination, estimates, of, the, discriminatory, component, of, the, gender, pay, gap, vary, the, oecd, estimated, that, approximately, 30, of, the, gender, pay, gap, across, oecd, countries, is, because, of, discrimination, australian, research, shows, that, discrimination, accounts, for, approximately, 60, of, the, wage, differential, between, men, and, women, studies, examining, the, gender, pay, gap, in, the, united, states, show, that, a, much, of, the, wage, differential, remains, unexplained, after, controlling, for, factors, affecting, pay, one, study, of, college, graduates, found, that, the, portion, of, the, pay, gap, unexplained, after, all, other, factors, are, taken, into, account, is, five, percent, one, year, after, graduating, and, 12, a, decade, after, graduation, a, study, by, the, american, association, of, university, women, found, that, women, graduates, in, the, united, states, are, paid, less, than, men, doing, the, same, work, and, majoring, in, the, same, field, wage, discrimination, is, theorized, as, contradicting, the, economic, concept, of, supply, and, demand, which, states, that, if, a, good, or, service, in, this, case, labor, is, in, demand, and, has, value, it, will, find, its, price, in, the, market, if, a, worker, offered, equal, value, for, less, pay, supply, and, demand, would, indicate, a, greater, demand, for, lower, paid, workers, if, a, business, hired, lower, wage, workers, for, the, same, work, it, would, lower, its, costs, and, enjoy, a, competitive, advantage, according, to, supply, and, demand, if, women, offered, equal, value, demand, and, wages, should, rise, since, they, offer, a, better, price, lower, wages, for, their, service, than, men, do, research, at, cornell, university, and, elsewhere, indicates, that, mothers, in, the, united, states, are, less, likely, to, be, hired, than, equally, qualified, fathers, and, if, hired, receive, a, lower, salary, than, male, applicants, with, children, the, oecd, found, that, a, significant, impact, of, children, on, women, s, pay, is, generally, found, in, the, united, kingdom, and, the, united, states, fathers, earn, 7, 500, more, on, average, than, men, without, children, do, there, is, research, to, suggest, that, the, gender, wage, gap, leads, to, big, losses, for, the, economy, the, non, adjusted, gender, pay, gap, the, difference, without, taking, into, account, differences, in, working, hours, occupations, education, and, work, experience, is, not, itself, a, measure, of, discrimination, rather, it, combines, differences, in, the, average, pay, of, women, and, men, to, serve, as, a, barometer, of, comparison, differences, in, pay, are, caused, by, some, variables, that, help, explain, the, non, adjusted, gender, pay, gap, include, economic, activity, working, time, and, job, tenure, gender, specific, factors, including, gender, differences, in, qualifications, and, discrimination, overall, wage, structure, and, the, differences, in, remuneration, across, industry, sectors, all, influence, the, gender, pay, gap, eurostat, estimated, in, 2016, that, after, allowing, for, average, characteristics, of, men, and, women, women, still, earn, 11, 5, less, than, men, since, this, estimate, accounts, for, average, differences, between, men, and, women, it, is, an, estimation, of, the, unexplained, gender, pay, gap, i, e, that, which, cannot, be, accounted, for, by, factors, such, as, differences, in, profession, the, popular, notion, of, glass, ceiling, effects, implies, that, gender, or, other, disadvantages, are, stronger, at, the, top, of, the, hierarchy, than, at, lower, levels, and, that, these, disadvantages, become, worse, later, in, a, person, s, career, in, the, united, states, women, account, for, 52, of, the, overall, labor, force, but, make, up, only, three, percent, of, corporate, ceos, and, top, executives, some, researchers, see, the, root, cause, of, this, situation, in, the, tacit, discrimination, based, on, gender, conducted, by, current, top, executives, and, corporate, directors, primarily, male, and, the, historic, absence, of, women, in, top, positions, which, may, lead, to, hysteresis, preventing, women, from, accessing, powerful, male, dominated, professional, networks, or, same, sex, mentors, the, glass, ceiling, effect, is, noted, as, being, especially, persistent, for, women, of, color, according, to, a, report, women, of, colour, perceive, a, concrete, ceiling, and, not, simply, a, glass, ceiling, in, the, economics, profession, it, has, been, observed, that, women, are, more, inclined, than, men, to, dedicate, their, time, to, teaching, and, service, since, continuous, research, work, is, crucial, for, promotion, the, cumulative, effect, of, small, contemporaneous, differences, in, research, orientation, could, generate, the, observed, significant, gender, difference, in, promotion, in, the, high, tech, industry, research, shows, that, regardless, of, the, intra, firm, changes, extra, organizational, pressures, will, likely, contribute, to, continued, gender, stratification, as, firms, upgrade, leading, to, the, potential, masculinization, of, skilled, high, tech, work, the, united, nations, asserts, that, progress, in, bringing, women, into, leadership, and, decision, making, positions, around, the, world, remains, far, too, slow, research, by, david, matsa, and, amalia, miller, suggests, that, a, remedy, to, the, glass, ceiling, could, be, increasing, the, number, of, women, on, corporate, boards, which, could, lead, to, increases, in, the, number, of, women, working, in, top, management, positions, the, same, research, suggests, that, this, could, also, result, in, a, feedback, cycle, in, which, the, presence, of, more, female, managers, increases, the, qualified, pool, of, potential, female, board, members, for, the, companies, they, manage, as, well, as, other, companies, leading, to, greater, female, board, membership, and, then, further, increases, in, female, executives, a, 2009, study, found, that, being, overweight, harms, women, s, career, advancement, but, presents, no, barrier, for, men, overweight, women, were, significantly, underrepresented, among, company, bosses, making, up, between, five, and, 22, of, female, ceos, however, the, proportion, of, overweight, male, ceos, was, between, 45, and, 61, over, representing, overweight, men, on, the, other, hand, approximately, five, percent, of, ceos, were, obese, among, both, genders, the, author, of, the, study, stated, that, the, results, suggest, that, the, glass, ceiling, effect, on, women, s, advancement, may, reflect, not, only, general, negative, stereotypes, about, the, competencies, of, women, but, also, weight, bias, that, results, in, the, application, of, stricter, appearance, standards, to, women, transgender, people, also, experience, significant, workplace, discrimination, and, harassment, unlike, sex, based, discrimination, refusing, to, hire, or, firing, a, worker, for, their, gender, identity, or, expression, is, not, explicitly, illegal, in, most, u, s, states, in, june, 2020, the, united, states, supreme, court, ruled, that, federal, civil, rights, law, protects, gay, lesbian, and, transgender, workers, writing, for, the, majority, justice, neil, gorsuch, wrote, an, employer, who, fires, an, individual, for, being, homosexual, or, transgender, fires, that, person, for, traits, or, actions, it, would, not, have, questioned, in, members, of, a, different, sex, sex, plays, a, necessary, and, undisguisable, role, in, the, decision, exactly, what, title, vii, forbids, the, ruling, however, did, not, protect, lgbt, employees, from, being, fired, based, on, their, sexual, orientation, or, gender, identity, in, businesses, of, 15, workers, or, less, in, august, 1995, kimberly, nixon, filed, a, complaint, with, the, british, columbia, human, rights, tribunal, against, vancouver, rape, relief, women, s, shelter, nixon, a, trans, woman, had, been, interested, in, volunteering, as, a, counsellor, with, the, shelter, when, the, shelter, learned, that, she, was, transsexual, they, told, nixon, that, she, would, not, be, allowed, to, volunteer, with, the, organization, nixon, argued, that, this, constituted, illegal, discrimination, under, section, 41, of, the, british, columbia, human, rights, code, vancouver, rape, relief, countered, that, individuals, are, shaped, by, the, socialization, and, experiences, of, their, formative, years, and, that, nixon, had, been, socialized, as, a, male, growing, up, and, that, therefore, nixon, would, not, be, able, to, provide, sufficiently, effective, counselling, to, the, female, born, women, that, the, shelter, served, nixon, took, her, case, to, the, supreme, court, of, canada, which, refused, to, hear, the, case, in, social, philosophy, objectification, is, the, act, of, treating, a, person, as, an, object, or, thing, objectification, plays, a, central, role, in, feminist, theory, especially, sexual, objectification, feminist, writer, and, gender, equality, activist, joy, goh, mah, argues, that, by, being, objectified, a, person, is, denied, agency, according, to, the, philosopher, martha, nussbaum, a, person, might, be, objectified, if, one, or, more, of, the, following, properties, are, applied, to, them, rae, helen, langton, in, sexual, solipsism, philosophical, essays, on, pornography, and, objectification, proposed, three, more, properties, to, be, added, to, nussbaum, s, list, according, to, objectification, theory, objectification, can, have, important, repercussions, on, women, particularly, young, women, as, it, can, negatively, impact, their, psychological, health, and, lead, to, the, development, of, mental, disorders, such, as, unipolar, depression, sexual, dysfunction, and, eating, disorders, while, advertising, used, to, portray, women, and, men, in, obviously, stereotypical, roles, e, g, as, a, housewife, breadwinner, in, modern, advertisements, they, are, no, longer, solely, confined, to, their, traditional, roles, however, advertising, today, still, stereotypes, men, and, women, albeit, in, more, subtle, ways, including, by, sexually, objectifying, them, women, are, most, often, targets, of, sexism, in, advertising, when, in, advertisements, with, men, they, are, often, shorter, and, put, in, the, background, of, images, shown, in, more, feminine, poses, and, generally, present, a, higher, degree, of, body, display, today, some, countries, for, example, norway, and, denmark, have, laws, against, sexual, objectification, in, advertising, nudity, is, not, banned, and, nude, people, can, be, used, to, advertise, a, product, if, they, are, relevant, to, the, product, advertised, sol, olving, head, of, norway, s, kreativt, forum, an, association, of, the, country, s, top, advertising, agencies, explained, you, could, have, a, naked, person, advertising, shower, gel, or, a, cream, but, not, a, woman, in, a, bikini, draped, across, a, car, other, countries, continue, to, ban, nudity, on, traditional, obscenity, grounds, but, also, make, explicit, reference, to, sexual, objectification, such, as, israel, s, ban, of, billboards, that, depicts, sexual, humiliation, or, abasement, or, presents, a, human, being, as, an, object, available, for, sexual, use, anti, pornography, feminist, catharine, mackinnon, argues, that, pornography, contributes, to, sexism, by, objectifying, women, and, portraying, them, in, submissive, roles, mackinnon, along, with, andrea, dworkin, argues, that, pornography, reduces, women, to, mere, tools, and, is, a, form, of, sex, discrimination, the, two, scholars, highlight, the, link, between, objectification, and, pornography, by, stating, we, define, pornography, as, the, graphic, sexually, explicit, subordination, of, women, through, pictures, and, words, that, also, includes, i, women, are, presented, dehumanized, as, sexual, objects, things, or, commodities, or, ii, women, are, presented, as, sexual, objects, who, enjoy, humiliation, or, pain, or, iii, women, are, presented, as, sexual, objects, experiencing, sexual, pleasure, in, rape, incest, or, other, sexual, assault, or, iv, women, are, presented, as, sexual, objects, tied, up, cut, up, or, mutilated, or, bruised, or, physically, hurt, or, v, women, are, presented, in, postures, or, positions, of, sexual, submission, servility, or, display, or, vi, women, s, body, parts, including, but, not, limited, to, vaginas, breasts, or, buttocks, are, exhibited, such, that, women, are, reduced, to, those, parts, or, vii, women, are, presented, being, penetrated, by, objects, or, animals, or, viii, women, are, presented, in, scenarios, of, degradation, humiliation, injury, torture, shown, as, filthy, or, inferior, bleeding, bruised, or, hurt, in, a, context, that, makes, these, conditions, sexual, robin, morgan, and, catharine, mackinnon, suggest, that, certain, types, of, pornography, also, contribute, to, violence, against, women, by, eroticizing, scenes, in, which, women, are, dominated, coerced, humiliated, or, sexually, assaulted, some, people, opposed, to, pornography, including, mackinnon, charge, that, the, production, of, pornography, entails, physical, psychological, and, economic, coercion, of, the, women, who, perform, and, model, in, it, opponents, of, pornography, charge, that, it, presents, a, distorted, image, of, sexual, relations, and, reinforces, sexual, myths, it, shows, women, as, continually, available, and, willing, to, engage, in, sex, at, any, time, with, any, person, on, their, terms, responding, positively, to, any, requests, mackinnon, writes, pornography, affects, people, s, belief, in, rape, myths, so, for, example, if, a, woman, says, i, didn, t, consent, and, people, have, been, viewing, pornography, they, believe, rape, myths, and, believe, the, woman, did, consent, no, matter, what, she, said, that, when, she, said, no, she, meant, yes, when, she, said, she, didn, t, want, to, that, meant, more, beer, when, she, said, she, would, prefer, to, go, home, that, means, she, s, a, lesbian, who, needs, to, be, given, a, good, corrective, experience, pornography, promotes, these, rape, myths, and, desensitizes, people, to, violence, against, women, so, that, you, need, more, violence, to, become, sexually, aroused, if, you, re, a, pornography, consumer, this, is, very, well, documented, defenders, of, pornography, and, anti, censorship, activists, including, sex, positive, feminists, argue, that, pornography, does, not, seriously, impact, a, mentally, healthy, individual, since, the, viewer, can, distinguish, between, fantasy, and, reality, some, also, contend, that, both, men, and, women, are, objectified, in, pornography, particularly, sadistic, or, masochistic, pornography, in, which, men, are, objectified, and, sexually, used, by, women, prostitution, is, the, business, or, practice, of, engaging, in, sexual, relations, for, payment, sex, workers, are, often, objectified, and, are, seen, as, existing, only, to, serve, clients, thus, calling, their, sense, of, agency, into, question, there, is, a, prevailing, notion, that, because, they, sell, sex, professionally, prostitutes, automatically, consent, to, all, sexual, contact, as, a, result, sex, workers, face, higher, rates, of, violence, and, sexual, assault, this, is, often, dismissed, ignored, and, not, taken, seriously, by, authorities, in, many, countries, prostitution, is, dominated, by, brothels, or, pimps, who, often, claim, ownership, over, sex, workers, this, sense, of, ownership, furthers, the, concept, that, sex, workers, are, void, of, agency, this, is, literally, the, case, in, instances, of, sexual, slavery, various, authors, have, argued, that, female, prostitution, is, based, on, male, sexism, that, condones, the, idea, that, unwanted, sex, with, a, woman, is, acceptable, that, men, s, desires, must, be, satisfied, and, that, women, are, coerced, into, and, exist, to, serve, men, sexually, the, european, women, s, lobby, condemned, prostitution, as, an, intolerable, form, of, male, violence, carole, pateman, writes, that, prostitution, is, the, use, of, a, woman, s, body, by, a, man, for, his, own, satisfaction, there, is, no, desire, or, satisfaction, on, the, part, of, the, prostitute, prostitution, is, not, mutual, pleasurable, exchange, of, the, use, of, bodies, but, the, unilateral, use, of, a, woman, s, body, by, a, man, in, exchange, for, money, some, scholars, believe, that, media, portrayals, of, demographic, groups, can, both, maintain, and, disrupt, attitudes, and, behaviors, toward, those, groups, according, to, susan, douglas, since, the, early, 1990s, much, of, the, media, have, come, to, overrepresent, women, as, having, made, it, completely, in, the, professions, as, having, gained, sexual, equality, with, men, and, having, achieved, a, level, of, financial, success, and, comfort, enjoyed, primarily, by, tiffany, s, encrusted, doyennes, of, laguna, beach, these, images, may, be, harmful, particularly, to, women, and, racial, and, ethnic, minority, groups, for, example, a, study, of, african, american, women, found, they, feel, that, media, portrayals, of, themselves, often, reinforce, stereotypes, of, this, group, as, overly, sexual, and, idealize, images, of, lighter, skinned, thinner, african, american, women, images, african, american, women, describe, as, objectifying, in, a, recent, analysis, of, images, of, haitian, women, in, the, associated, press, photo, archive, from, 1994, to, 2009, several, themes, emerged, emphasizing, the, otherness, of, haitian, women, and, characterizing, them, as, victims, in, need, of, rescue, in, an, attempt, to, study, the, effect, of, media, consumption, on, males, samantha, and, bridges, found, an, effect, on, body, shame, though, not, through, self, objectification, as, it, was, found, in, comparable, studies, of, women, the, authors, conclude, that, the, current, measures, of, objectification, were, designed, for, women, and, do, not, measure, men, accurately, another, study, found, a, negative, effect, on, eating, attitudes, and, body, satisfaction, of, consumption, of, beauty, and, fitness, magazines, for, women, and, men, respectively, but, again, with, different, mechanisms, namely, self, objectification, for, women, and, internalization, for, men, frederick, attenborough, argues, that, sexist, jokes, can, be, a, form, of, sexual, objectification, which, reduce, the, butt, of, the, joke, to, an, object, they, not, only, objectify, women, but, can, also, condone, violence, or, prejudice, against, women, sexist, humor, the, denigration, of, women, through, humor, for, instance, trivializes, sex, discrimination, under, the, veil, of, benign, amusement, thus, precluding, challenges, or, opposition, that, nonhumorous, sexist, communication, would, likely, incur, a, study, of, 73, male, undergraduate, students, by, ford, found, that, sexist, humor, can, promote, the, behavioral, expression, of, prejudice, against, women, amongst, sexist, men, according, to, the, study, when, sexism, is, presented, in, a, humorous, manner, it, is, viewed, as, tolerable, and, socially, acceptable, disparagement, of, women, through, humor, freed, sexist, participants, from, having, to, conform, to, the, more, general, and, more, restrictive, norms, regarding, discrimination, against, women, gender, discrimination, is, discrimination, based, on, actual, or, perceived, gender, identity, gender, identity, is, the, gender, related, identity, appearance, or, mannerisms, or, other, gender, related, characteristics, of, an, individual, with, or, without, regard, to, the, individual, s, designated, sex, at, birth, gender, discrimination, is, theoretically, different, from, sexism, whereas, sexism, is, prejudice, based, on, biological, sex, gender, discrimination, specifically, addresses, discrimination, towards, gender, identities, including, third, gender, genderqueer, and, other, non, binary, identified, people, it, is, especially, attributed, to, how, people, are, treated, in, the, workplace, and, banning, discrimination, on, the, basis, of, gender, identity, and, expression, has, emerged, as, a, subject, of, contention, in, the, american, legal, system, according, to, a, recent, report, by, the, congressional, research, service, although, the, majority, of, federal, courts, to, consider, the, issue, have, concluded, that, discrimination, on, the, basis, of, gender, identity, is, not, sex, discrimination, there, have, been, several, courts, that, have, reached, the, opposite, conclusion, hurst, states, that, ourts, often, confuse, sex, gender, and, sexual, orientation, and, confuse, them, in, a, way, that, results, in, denying, the, rights, not, only, of, gays, and, lesbians, but, also, of, those, who, do, not, present, themselves, or, act, in, a, manner, traditionally, expected, of, their, sex, oppositional, sexism, is, a, term, coined, by, transfeminist, author, julia, serano, who, defined, oppositional, sexism, as, the, belief, that, male, and, female, are, rigid, mutually, exclusive, categories, oppositional, sexism, plays, a, vital, role, in, a, number, of, social, norms, such, as, cisnormativity, and, heteronormativity, oppositional, sexism, normalizes, masculine, expression, in, males, and, feminine, expression, in, females, while, simultaneously, demonizing, femininity, in, males, and, masculinity, in, females, this, concept, plays, a, crucial, role, in, supporting, cissexism, the, social, norm, that, views, cisgender, people, as, both, natural, and, privileged, as, opposed, to, transgender, people, the, idea, of, having, two, opposite, genders, is, tied, to, sexuality, through, what, gender, theorist, judith, butler, calls, a, compulsory, practice, of, heterosexuality, because, oppositional, sexism, is, tied, to, heteronormativity, in, this, way, non, heterosexuals, are, seen, as, breaking, gender, norms, the, concept, of, opposite, genders, sets, a, dangerous, precedent, according, to, serano, where, if, men, are, big, then, women, must, be, small, and, if, men, are, strong, then, women, must, be, weak, the, gender, binary, and, oppositional, norms, work, together, to, support, traditional, sexism, the, belief, that, femininity, is, inferior, to, and, serves, masculinity, serano, states, that, oppositional, sexism, works, in, tandem, with, traditional, sexism, this, ensures, that, those, who, are, masculine, have, power, over, those, who, are, feminine, and, that, only, those, that, are, born, male, will, be, seen, as, authentically, masculine, transgender, discrimination, is, discrimination, towards, peoples, whose, gender, identity, differs, from, the, social, expectations, of, the, biological, sex, they, were, born, with, forms, of, discrimination, include, but, are, not, limited, to, identity, documents, not, reflecting, one, s, gender, sex, segregated, public, restrooms, and, other, facilities, dress, codes, according, to, binary, gender, codes, and, lack, of, access, to, and, existence, of, appropriate, health, care, services, in, a, recent, adjudication, the, equal, employment, opportunity, commission, eeoc, concluded, that, discrimination, against, a, transgender, person, is, sex, discrimination, the, 2008, 09, national, transgender, discrimination, survey, ntds, a, u, s, study, by, the, national, center, for, transgender, equality, and, the, national, gay, and, lesbian, task, force, in, collaboration, with, the, national, black, justice, coalition, that, was, at, its, time, the, most, extensive, survey, of, transgender, discrimination, showed, that, black, transgender, people, in, the, united, states, suffer, the, combination, of, anti, transgender, bias, and, persistent, structural, and, individual, racism, and, that, black, transgender, people, live, in, extreme, poverty, that, is, more, than, twice, the, rate, for, transgender, people, of, all, races, 15, four, times, the, general, black, population, rate, 9, and, over, eight, times, the, general, us, population, rate, 4, further, discrimination, is, faced, by, gender,

there, were, several, instances, of, conscription, of, women, in, antiquity, and, the, middle, ages, 255, today, most, countries, still, require, only, men, to, serve, in, the, military, in, his,

only, men, who, should, be, conscripted, and, similarly, that, only, males, should, be, forced, into, combat, this, he, believes, is, a, sexist, assumption, 102, anthropologist, ayse, g, l, altinay,

rates, are, widely, disputed, there, is, a, large, body, of, cross, cultural, evidence, that, domestic, violence, is, mostly, committed, by, men, against, women, in, addition, there, is, a, broad, consensus, that, women, are, more, often, subjected, to, severe, forms, of, abuse, and, are, more, likely, to, be, injured, by, an, abusive, partner, the, united, nations, recognizes, domestic, violence, as, a, form, of, gender, based, violence, which, it, describes, as, a, human, rights, violation, and, the, result, of, sexism, domestic, violence, is, tolerated, and, even, legally, accepted, in, many, parts, of, the, world, for, instance, in, 2010, the, united, arab, emirates, uae, s, supreme, court, ruled, that, a, man, has, the, right, to, discipline, his, wife, and, children, physically, if, he, does, not, leave, visible, marks, in, 2015, equality, now, drew, attention, to, a, section, of, the, penal, code, of, northern, nigeria, titled, correction, of, child, pupil, servant, or, wife, which, reads, 1, nothing, is, an, offence, which, does, not, amount, to, the, infliction, of, grievous, hurt, upon, any, persons, which, is, done, d, by, a, husband, for, the, purpose, of, correcting, his, wife, such, husband, and, wife, being, subject, to, any, native, law, or, custom, in, which, such, correction, is, recognized, as, lawful, honor, killings, are, another, form, of, domestic, violence, practiced, in, several, parts, of, the, world, and, their, victims, are, predominantly, women, honor, killings, can, occur, because, of, refusal, to, enter, into, an, arranged, marriage, maintaining, a, relationship, relatives, disapprove, of, extramarital, sex, becoming, the, victim, of, rape, dress, seen, as, inappropriate, or, homosexuality, the, united, nations, office, on, drugs, and, crime, states, that, onour, crimes, including, killing, are, one, of, history, s, oldest, forms, of, gender, based, violence, according, to, a, report, of, the, special, rapporteur, submitted, to, the, 58th, session, of, the, united, nations, commission, on, human, rights, concerning, cultural, practices, in, the, family, that, reflect, violence, against, women, the, special, rapporteur, indicated, that, there, had, been, contradictory, decisions, with, regard, to, the, honor, defense, in, brazil, and, that, legislative, provisions, allowing, for, partial, or, complete, defense, in, that, context, could, be, found, in, the, penal, codes, of, argentina, ecuador, egypt, guatemala, iran, israel, jordan, peru, syria, venezuela, and, the, palestinian, national, authority, practices, such, as, honor, killings, and, stoning, continue, to, be, supported, by, mainstream, politicians, and, other, officials, in, some, countries, in, pakistan, after, the, 2008, balochistan, honor, killings, in, which, five, women, were, killed, by, tribesmen, of, the, umrani, tribe, of, balochistan, pakistani, federal, minister, for, postal, services, israr, ullah, zehri, defended, the, practice, these, are, centuries, old, traditions, and, i, will, continue, to, defend, them, only, those, who, indulge, in, immoral, acts, should, be, afraid, following, the, 2006, case, of, sakineh, mohammadi, ashtiani, which, has, placed, iran, under, international, pressure, for, its, stoning, sentences, mohammad, javad, larijani, a, senior, envoy, and, chief, of, iran, s, human, rights, council, defended, the, practice, of, stoning, he, claimed, it, was, a, lesser, punishment, than, execution, because, it, allowed, those, convicted, a, chance, at, survival, dowry, deaths, result, from, the, killing, of, women, who, are, unable, to, pay, the, high, dowry, price, for, their, marriage, according, to, amnesty, international, the, ongoing, reality, of, dowry, related, violence, is, an, example, of, what, can, happen, when, women, are, treated, as, property, women, have, traditionally, had, limited, access, to, higher, education, in, the, past, when, women, were, admitted, to, higher, education, they, were, encouraged, to, major, in, less, scientific, subjects, the, study, of, english, literature, in, american, and, british, colleges, and, universities, was, instituted, as, a, field, considered, suitable, to, women, s, lesser, intellects, educational, specialties, in, higher, education, produce, and, perpetuate, inequality, between, men, and, women, disparity, persists, particularly, in, computer, and, information, science, where, in, the, us, women, received, only, 21, of, the, undergraduate, degrees, and, in, engineering, where, women, obtained, only, 19, of, the, degrees, in, 2008, only, one, out, of, five, of, physics, doctorates, in, the, us, are, awarded, to, women, and, only, about, half, those, women, are, american, of, all, the, physics, professors, in, the, country, only, 14, are, women, as, of, 2019, women, account, for, just, 27, of, all, workers, in, stem, fields, and, on, average, earn, almost, 20, less, than, men, in, the, same, industries, world, literacy, is, lower, for, females, than, for, males, data, from, the, world, factbook, shows, that, 79, 7, of, women, are, literate, compared, to, 88, 6, of, men, aged, 15, and, over, in, some, parts, of, the, world, girls, continue, to, be, excluded, from, proper, public, or, private, education, in, parts, of, afghanistan, girls, who, go, to, school, face, serious, violence, from, some, local, community, members, and, religious, groups, according, to, 2010, un, estimates, only, afghanistan, pakistan, and, yemen, had, less, than, 90, girls, per, 100, boys, at, school, jayachandran, and, lleras, muney, s, study, of, sri, lankan, economic, development, has, suggested, that, increases, in, the, life, expectancy, for, women, encourages, educational, investment, because, a, longer, time, horizon, increases, the, value, of, investments, that, pay, out, over, time, educational, opportunities, and, outcomes, for, women, have, greatly, improved, in, the, west, since, 1991, the, proportion, of, women, enrolled, in, college, in, the, united, states, has, exceeded, the, enrollment, rate, for, men, and, the, gap, has, widened, over, time, as, of, 2007, women, made, up, the, majority, 54, of, the, 10, 8, million, college, students, enrolled, in, the, united, states, however, research, by, diane, halpern, has, indicated, that, boys, receive, more, attention, praise, blame, and, punishment, in, the, grammar, school, classroom, and, this, pattern, of, more, active, teacher, attention, directed, at, male, students, continues, at, the, postsecondary, level, over, time, female, students, speak, less, in, a, classroom, setting, teachers, also, tend, to, spend, more, time, supporting, the, academic, achievements, of, girls, boys, are, frequently, diagnosed, with, adhd, which, some, see, as, a, result, of, school, systems, being, more, likely, to, apply, these, labels, to, males, a, recent, study, by, the, oecd, in, over, 60, countries, found, that, teachers, give, boys, lower, grades, for, the, same, work, the, researchers, attribute, this, to, stereotypical, ideas, about, boys, and, recommend, teachers, to, be, aware, of, this, gender, bias, one, study, found, that, students, give, female, professors, worse, evaluation, scores, than, male, professors, even, though, the, students, appear, to, do, as, well, under, female, professors, as, male, professors, gender, bias, and, gender, based, discrimination, still, permeate, the, education, process, in, many, settings, for, example, in, the, teaching, and, learning, process, including, differential, engagement, expectations, and, interactions, by, teachers, with, their, male, and, female, students, as, well, as, gender, stereotypes, in, textbooks, and, learning, materials, there, has, been, a, lack, in, adequate, resources, and, infrastructure, to, ensure, safe, and, enabling, learning, environments, and, insufficient, policy, legal, and, planning, frameworks, that, respect, protect, and, fulfil, the, right, to, education, feminists, argue, that, clothing, and, footwear, fashion, have, been, oppressive, to, women, restricting, their, movements, increasing, their, vulnerability, and, endangering, their, health, using, thin, models, in, the, fashion, industry, has, encouraged, the, development, of, bulimia, and, anorexia, nervosa, as, well, as, locking, female, consumers, into, false, feminine, identities, the, assignment, of, gender, specific, baby, clothes, can, instill, in, children, a, belief, in, negative, gender, stereotypes, one, example, is, the, assignment, in, some, countries, of, the, color, pink, to, girls, and, blue, to, boys, the, fashion, is, recent, one, at, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, the, trend, was, the, opposite, blue, for, girls, and, pink, for, boys, in, the, early, 1900s, the, women, s, journal, wrote, that, pink, being, a, more, decided, and, stronger, colour, is, more, suitable, for, the, boy, while, blue, which, is, more, delicate, and, dainty, is, prettier, for, the, girl, dressmaker, magazine, also, explained, that, he, preferred, colour, to, dress, young, boys, in, is, pink, blue, is, reserved, for, girls, as, it, is, considered, paler, and, the, more, dainty, of, the, two, colours, and, pink, is, thought, to, be, stronger, akin, to, red, today, in, many, countries, it, is, considered, inappropriate, for, boys, to, wear, dresses, and, skirts, but, this, is, also, a, relatively, recent, view, from, the, mid, 16th, century, until, the, late, 19th, or, early, 20th, century, young, boys, in, the, western, world, were, unbreeched, and, wore, gowns, or, dresses, until, an, age, that, varied, between, two, and, eight, laws, that, dictate, how, women, must, dress, are, seen, by, many, international, human, rights, organizations, such, as, amnesty, international, as, gender, discrimination, in, many, countries, women, face, violence, for, failing, to, adhere, to, certain, dress, codes, whether, by, the, authorities, such, as, the, religious, police, family, members, or, the, community, amnesty, international, states, interpretations, of, religion, culture, or, tradition, cannot, justify, imposing, rules, about, dress, on, those, who, choose, to, dress, differently, states, should, take, measures, to, protect, individuals, from, being, coerced, to, dress, in, specific, ways, by, family, members, community, or, religious, groups, or, leaders, the, production, process, also, faces, criticism, for, sexist, practices, in, the, garment, industry, approximately, 80, percent, of, workers, are, female, much, garment, production, is, located, in, asia, because, of, low, labor, costs, women, who, work, in, these, factories, are, sexually, harassed, by, managers, and, male, workers, paid, low, wages, and, discriminated, against, when, pregnant, female, genital, mutilation, is, defined, by, the, world, health, organization, who, as, all, procedures, that, involve, partial, or, total, removal, of, the, external, female, genitalia, or, other, injury, to, the, female, genital, organs, for, non, medical, reasons, the, who, further, states, the, practice, has, no, health, benefits, for, girls, and, women, and, cause, severe, bleeding, and, problems, urinating, and, later, cysts, infections, as, well, as, complications, in, childbirth, and, increased, risk, of, newborn, deaths, it, is, recognized, internationally, as, a, violation, of, the, human, rights, of, girls, and, women, and, constitutes, an, extreme, form, of, discrimination, against, women, the, european, parliament, stated, in, a, 2014, resolution, that, the, practice, clearly, goes, against, the, european, founding, value, of, equality, between, women, and, men, and, maintains, traditional, values, according, to, which, women, are, seen, as, the, objects, and, properties, of, men, female, infanticide, is, the, killing, of, newborn, female, children, while, female, selective, abortion, is, the, terminating, of, a, pregnancy, based, upon, the, female, sex, of, the, fetus, gendercide, is, the, systematic, killing, of, members, of, a, specific, gender, and, it, is, an, extreme, form, of, gender, based, violence, female, infanticide, is, more, common, than, male, infanticide, and, is, especially, prevalent, in, south, asia, in, countries, such, as, china, india, and, pakistan, recent, studies, suggest, that, over, 90, million, women, and, girls, are, missing, in, china, and, india, as, a, result, of, infanticide, sex, selective, abortion, involves, terminating, a, pregnancy, based, upon, the, predicted, sex, of, the, baby, the, abortion, of, female, fetuses, is, most, common, in, areas, where, a, culture, values, male, children, over, females, such, as, parts, of, east, asia, and, south, asia, china, india, korea, the, caucasus, azerbaijan, armenia, and, georgia, and, western, balkans, albania, macedonia, montenegro, kosovo, one, reason, for, this, preference, is, that, males, are, seen, as, generating, more, income, than, females, the, trend, has, grown, steadily, over, the, previous, decade, and, may, result, in, a, future, shortage, of, women, forced, sterilization, and, forced, abortion, are, also, forms, of, gender, based, violence, forced, sterilization, was, practiced, during, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, by, many, western, countries, and, there, are, reports, of, this, practice, being, currently, employed, in, some, countries, such, as, uzbekistan, and, china, in, china, the, one, child, policy, interacting, with, the, low, status, of, women, has, been, deemed, responsible, for, many, abuses, such, as, female, infanticide, sex, selective, abortion, abandonment, of, baby, girls, forced, abortion, and, forced, sterilization, in, india, the, custom, of, dowry, is, strongly, related, to, female, infanticide, sex, selective, abortion, abandonment, and, mistreatment, of, girls, such, practices, are, especially, present, in, the, northwestern, part, of, the, country, jammu, and, kashmir, haryana, punjab, uttarakhand, and, delhi, see, female, foeticide, in, india, and, female, infanticide, in, india, in, several, organisation, of, islamic, cooperation, oic, countries, the, legal, testimony, of, a, woman, is, worth, legally, half, of, that, of, a, man, see, status, of, women, s, testimony, in, islam, such, countries, include, algeria, in, criminal, cases, bahrain, in, sharia, courts, egypt, in, family, courts, iran, in, most, cases, iraq, in, some, cases, jordan, in, sharia, courts, kuwait, in, family, courts, libya, in, some, cases, morocco, in, family, cases, palestine, in, cases, related, to, marriage, divorce, and, child, custody, qatar, in, family, law, matters, syria, in, sharia, courts, united, arab, emirates, in, some, civil, matters, yemen, not, allowed, to, testify, at, all, in, cases, of, adultery, and, retribution, and, saudi, arabia, such, laws, have, been, criticized, by, human, rights, watch, and, equality, now, as, being, discriminatory, towards, women, the, criminal, justice, system, in, many, common, law, countries, has, also, been, accused, of, discriminating, against, women, provocation, is, in, many, common, law, countries, a, partial, defense, to, murder, which, converts, what, would, have, been, murder, into, manslaughter, it, is, meant, to, be, applied, when, a, person, kills, in, the, heat, of, passion, upon, being, provoked, by, the, behavior, of, the, victim, this, defense, has, been, criticized, as, being, gendered, favoring, men, because, of, it, being, used, disproportionately, in, cases, of, adultery, and, other, domestic, disputes, when, women, are, killed, by, their, partners, as, a, result, of, the, defense, exhibiting, a, strong, gender, bias, and, being, a, form, of, legitimization, of, male, violence, against, women, and, minimization, of, the, harm, caused, by, violence, against, women, it, has, been, abolished, or, restricted, in, several, jurisdictions, the, traditional, leniency, towards, crimes, of, passion, in, latin, american, countries, has, been, deemed, to, have, its, origin, in, the, view, that, women, are, property, in, 2002, widney, brown, advocacy, director, for, human, rights, watch, stated, that, o, called, crimes, of, passion, have, a, similar, dynamic, in, that, the, women, are, killed, by, male, family, members, and, the, crimes, are, perceived, as, excusable, or, understandable, the, office, of, the, united, nations, high, commissioner, for, human, rights, ohchr, has, called, for, the, elimination, of, discriminatory, provisions, in, the, legislation, including, mitigating, factors, for, crimes, of, passion, in, the, united, states, some, studies, have, shown, that, for, identical, crimes, men, are, given, harsher, sentences, than, women, controlling, for, arrest, offense, criminal, history, and, other, pre, charge, variables, sentences, are, over, 60, heavier, for, men, women, are, more, likely, to, avoid, charges, entirely, and, to, avoid, imprisonment, if, convicted, the, gender, disparity, varies, according, to, the, nature, of, the, case, for, example, the, gender, gap, is, less, pronounced, in, fraud, cases, than, in, drug, trafficking, and, firearms, this, disparity, occurs, in, us, federal, courts, despite, guidelines, designed, to, avoid, differential, sentencing, the, death, penalty, may, also, suffer, from, gender, bias, according, to, shatz, and, shatz, he, present, study, confirms, what, earlier, studies, have, shown, that, the, death, penalty, is, imposed, on, women, relatively, infrequently, and, that, it, is, disproportionately, imposed, for, the, killing, of, women, there, have, been, several, reasons, postulated, for, the, gender, criminal, justice, disparity, in, the, united, states, one, of, the, most, common, is, the, expectation, that, women, are, predominantly, care, givers, other, possible, reasons, include, the, girlfriend, theory, whereby, women, are, seen, as, tools, of, their, boyfriends, the, theory, that, female, defendants, are, more, likely, to, cooperate, with, authorities, and, that, women, are, often, successful, at, turning, their, violent, crime, into, victimhood, by, citing, defenses, such, as, postpartum, depression, or, battered, wife, syndrome, however, none, of, these, theories, account, for, the, total, disparity, and, sexism, has, also, been, suggested, as, an, underlying, cause, gender, discrimination, also, helps, explain, the, differences, between, trial, outcomes, in, which, some, female, defendants, are, sentenced, to, death, and, other, female, defendants, are, sentenced, to, lesser, punishments, phillip, barron, argues, that, female, defendants, are, more, likely, to, be, sentenced, to, death, for, crimes, that, violate, gender, norms, such, as, killing, children, or, killing, strangers, transgender, people, face, widespread, discrimination, while, incarcerated, they, are, generally, housed, according, to, their, legal, birth, sex, rather, than, their, gender, identity, studies, have, shown, that, transgender, people, are, at, an, increased, risk, for, harassment, and, sexual, assault, in, this, environment, they, may, also, be, denied, access, to, medical, procedures, related, to, their, reassignment, some, countries, use, stoning, as, a, form, of, capital, punishment, according, to, amnesty, international, the, majority, of, those, stoned, are, women, and, women, are, disproportionately, affected, by, stoning, because, of, sexism, in, the, legal, system, one, study, found, that, n, average, women, receive, lighter, sentences, in, comparison, with, men, roughly, 30, of, the, gender, differences, in, incarceration, cannot, be, explained, by, the, observed, criminal, characteristics, of, offense, and, offender, we, also, find, evidence, of, considerable, heterogeneity, across, judges, in, their, treatment, of, female, and, male, offenders, there, is, little, evidence, however, that, tastes, for, gender, discrimination, are, driving, the, mean, gender, disparity, or, the, variance, in, treatment, between, judges, a, 2017, study, by, knepper, found, that, female, plaintiffs, filing, workplace, sex, discrimination, claims, are, substantially, more, likely, to, settle, and, win, compensation, whenever, a, female, judge, is, assigned, to, the, case, additionally, female, judges, are, 15, percentage, points, less, likely, than, male, judges, to, grant, motions, filed, by, defendants, which, suggests, that, final, negotiations, are, shaped, by, the, emergence, of, the, bias, the, united, nations, population, fund, writes, that, family, planning, is, central, to, gender, equality, and, women, s, empowerment, women, in, many, countries, around, the, world, are, denied, medical, and, informational, services, related, to, reproductive, health, including, access, to, pregnancy, care, family, planning, and, contraception, in, countries, with, very, strict, abortion, laws, particularly, in, latin, america, women, who, suffer, miscarriages, are, often, investigated, by, the, police, under, suspicion, of, having, deliberately, provoked, the, miscarriage, and, are, sometimes, jailed, a, practice, which, amnesty, international, called, a, ruthless, campaign, against, women, s, rights, doctors, may, be, reluctant, to, treat, pregnant, women, who, are, very, ill, because, they, are, afraid, the, treatment, may, result, in, fetal, loss, according, to, amnesty, international, discriminatory, attitudes, towards, women, and, girls, also, means, access, to, sex, education, and, contraceptives, are, near, impossible, the, organization, has, also, criticized, laws, and, policies, which, require, the, husband, s, consent, for, a, woman, to, use, reproductive, health, services, as, being, discriminatory, and, dangerous, to, women, s, health, and, life, or, the, woman, who, needs, her, husband, s, consent, to, get, contraception, the, consequences, of, discrimination, can, be, serious, even, fatal, research, by, lisak, and, roth, into, factors, motivating, perpetrators, of, sexual, assault, including, rape, against, women, revealed, a, pattern, of,
