world, the, indo, aryan, migrations, theory, explains, the, common, features, shared, by, sanskrit, and, other, indo, european, languages, by, proposing, that, the, original, speakers, of, what, became, sanskrit, arrived, in, south, asia, from, a, region, of, common, origin, somewhere, north, west, of, the, indus, region, during, the, early, 2nd, millennium, bce, evidence, for, such, a, theory, includes, the, close, relationship, between, the, indo, iranian, tongues, and, the, baltic, and, slavic, languages, vocabulary, exchange, with, the, non, indo, european, uralic, languages, and, the, nature, of, the, attested, indo, european, words, for, flora, and, fauna, the, pre, history, of, indo, aryan, languages, which, preceded, vedic, sanskrit, is, unclear, and, various, hypotheses, place, it, over, a, fairly, wide, limit, according, to, thomas, burrow, based, on, the, relationship, between, various, indo, european, languages, the, origin, of, all, these, languages, may, possibly, be, in, what, is, now, central, or, eastern, europe, while, the, indo, iranian, group, possibly, arose, in, central, russia, the, iranian, and, indo, aryan, branches, separated, quite, early, it, is, the, indo, aryan, branch, that, moved, into, eastern, iran, and, then, south, into, south, asia, in, the, first, half, of, the, 2nd, millennium, bce, once, in, ancient, india, the, indo, aryan, language, underwent, rapid, linguistic, change, and, morphed, into, the, vedic, sanskrit, language, the, pre, classical, form, of, sanskrit, is, known, as, vedic, sanskrit, the, earliest, attested, sanskrit, text, is, the, rigveda, a, hindu, scripture, from, the, mid, to, late, second, millennium, bce, no, written, records, from, such, an, early, period, survive, if, any, ever, existed, but, scholars, are, generally, confident, that, the, oral, transmission, of, the, texts, is, reliable, they, are, ceremonial, literature, where, the, exact, phonetic, expression, and, its, preservation, were, a, part, of, the, historic, tradition, however, some, scholars, have, suggested, that, the, original, g, veda, differed, in, some, fundamental, ways, in, phonology, compared, to, the, sole, surviving, version, available, to, us, in, particular, that, retroflex, consonants, did, not, exist, as, a, natural, part, of, the, earliest, vedic, language, and, that, these, developed, in, the, centuries, after, the, composition, had, been, completed, and, as, a, gradual, unconscious, process, during, the, oral, transmission, by, generations, of, reciters, the, primary, source, for, this, argument, is, internal, evidence, of, the, text, which, betrays, an, instability, of, the, phenomenon, of, retroflexion, with, the, same, phrases, having, sandhi, induced, retroflexion, in, some, parts, but, not, other, this, is, taken, along, with, evidence, of, controversy, for, example, in, passages, of, the, aitareya, ra, yaka, 700, bce, which, features, a, discussion, on, whether, retroflexion, is, valid, in, particular, cases, the, g, veda, is, a, collection, of, books, created, by, multiple, authors, these, authors, represented, different, generations, and, the, mandalas, 2, to, 7, are, the, oldest, while, the, mandalas, 1, and, 10, are, relatively, the, youngest, yet, the, vedic, sanskrit, in, these, books, of, the, g, veda, hardly, presents, any, dialectical, diversity, states, louis, renou, an, indologist, known, for, his, scholarship, of, the, sanskrit, literature, and, the, g, veda, in, particular, according, to, renou, this, implies, that, the, vedic, sanskrit, language, had, a, set, linguistic, pattern, by, the, second, half, of, the, 2nd, millennium, bce, beyond, the, g, veda, the, ancient, literature, in, vedic, sanskrit, that, has, survived, into, the, modern, age, include, the, samaveda, yajurveda, atharvaveda, along, with, the, embedded, and, layered, vedic, texts, such, as, the, brahmanas, aranyakas, and, the, early, upanishads, these, vedic, documents, reflect, the, dialects, of, sanskrit, found, in, the, various, parts, of, the, northwestern, northern, and, eastern, indian, subcontinent, according, to, michael, witzel, vedic, sanskrit, was, a, spoken, language, of, the, semi, nomadic, aryans, who, temporarily, settled, in, one, place, maintained, cattle, herds, practiced, limited, agriculture, and, after, some, time, moved, by, wagon, trains, they, called, grama, the, vedic, sanskrit, language, or, a, closely, related, indo, european, variant, was, recognized, beyond, ancient, india, as, evidenced, by, the, mitanni, treaty, between, the, ancient, hittite, and, mitanni, people, carved, into, a, rock, in, a, region, that, now, includes, parts, of, syria, and, turkey, parts, of, this, treaty, such, as, the, names, of, the, mitanni, princes, and, technical, terms, related, to, horse, training, for, reasons, not, understood, are, in, early, forms, of, vedic, sanskrit, the, treaty, also, invokes, the, gods, varuna, mitra, indra, and, nasatya, found, in, the, earliest, layers, of, the, vedic, literature, o, b, haspati, when, in, giving, names, they, first, set, forth, the, beginning, of, language, their, most, excellent, and, spotless, secret, was, laid, bare, through, love, when, the, wise, ones, formed, language, with, their, mind, purifying, it, like, grain, with, a, winnowing, fan, then, friends, knew, friendships, an, auspicious, mark, placed, on, their, language, rigveda, 10, 71, 1, 4, translated, by, roger, woodard, the, vedic, sanskrit, found, in, the, g, veda, is, distinctly, more, archaic, than, other, vedic, texts, and, in, many, respects, the, rigvedic, language, is, notably, more, similar, to, those, found, in, the, archaic, texts, of, old, avestan, zoroastrian, gathas, and, homer, s, iliad, and, odyssey, according, to, stephanie, w, jamison, and, joel, p, brereton, indologists, known, for, their, translation, of, the, g, veda, the, vedic, sanskrit, literature, clearly, inherited, from, indo, iranian, and, indo, european, times, the, social, structures, such, as, the, role, of, the, poet, and, the, priests, the, patronage, economy, the, phrasal, equations, and, some, of, the, poetic, metres, while, there, are, similarities, state, jamison, and, brereton, there, are, also, differences, between, vedic, sanskrit, the, old, avestan, and, the, mycenaean, greek, literature, for, example, unlike, the, sanskrit, similes, in, the, g, veda, the, old, avestan, gathas, lack, simile, entirely, and, it, is, rare, in, the, later, version, of, the, language, the, homerian, greek, like, g, vedic, sanskrit, deploys, simile, extensively, but, they, are, structurally, very, different, the, early, vedic, form, of, the, sanskrit, language, was, far, less, homogenous, compared, to, the, classical, sanskrit, as, defined, by, grammarians, by, about, the, mid, 1st, millennium, bce, according, to, richard, gombrich, an, indologist, and, a, scholar, of, sanskrit, p, li, and, buddhist, studies, the, archaic, vedic, sanskrit, found, in, the, rigveda, had, already, evolved, in, the, vedic, period, as, evidenced, in, the, later, vedic, literature, gombrich, posits, that, the, language, in, the, early, upanishads, of, hinduism, and, the, late, vedic, literature, approaches, classical, sanskrit, while, the, archaic, vedic, sanskrit, had, by, the, buddha, s, time, become, unintelligible, to, all, except, ancient, indian, sages, the, formalization, of, the, sanskrit, language, is, credited, to, p, ini, along, with, patanjali, s, mah, bh, ya, and, katyayana, s, commentary, that, preceded, pata, jali, s, work, panini, composed, a, dhy, y, eight, chapter, grammar, the, century, in, which, he, lived, is, unclear, and, debated, but, his, work, is, generally, accepted, to, be, from, sometime, between, the, 6th, and, 4th, centuries, bce, the, a, dhy, y, was, not, the, first, description, of, sanskrit, grammar, but, it, is, the, earliest, that, has, survived, in, full, and, the, culmination, of, a, long, grammatical, tradition, that, fortson, says, is, one, of, the, intellectual, wonders, of, the, ancient, world, p, ini, cites, ten, scholars, on, the, phonological, and, grammatical, aspects, of, the, sanskrit, language, before, him, as, well, as, the, variants, in, the, usage, of, sanskrit, in, different, regions, of, india, the, ten, vedic, scholars, he, quotes, are, pi, ali, ka, yapa, g, rgya, g, lava, cakravarma, a, bh, radv, ja, ka, yana, kalya, senaka, and, spho, yana, the, a, dhy, y, of, panini, became, the, foundation, of, vy, kara, a, a, ved, nga, in, the, a, dhy, y, language, is, observed, in, a, manner, that, has, no, parallel, among, greek, or, latin, grammarians, p, ini, s, grammar, according, to, renou, and, filliozat, is, a, classic, that, defines, the, linguistic, expression, and, sets, the, standard, for, the, sanskrit, language, p, ini, made, use, of, a, technical, metalanguage, consisting, of, a, syntax, morphology, and, lexicon, this, metalanguage, is, organised, according, to, a, series, of, meta, rules, some, of, which, are, explicitly, stated, while, others, can, be, deduced, despite, differences, in, the, analysis, from, that, of, modern, linguistics, p, ini, s, work, has, been, found, valuable, and, the, most, advanced, analysis, of, linguistics, until, the, twentieth, century, p, ini, s, comprehensive, and, scientific, theory, of, grammar, is, conventionally, taken, to, mark, the, start, of, classical, sanskrit, his, systematic, treatise, inspired, and, made, sanskrit, the, preeminent, indian, language, of, learning, and, literature, for, two, millennia, it, is, unclear, whether, p, ini, himself, wrote, his, treatise, or, he, orally, created, the, detailed, and, sophisticated, treatise, then, transmitted, it, through, his, students, modern, scholarship, generally, accepts, that, he, knew, of, a, form, of, writing, based, on, references, to, words, such, as, lipi, script, and, lipikara, scribe, in, section, 3, 2, of, the, a, dhy, y, the, classical, sanskrit, language, formalized, by, p, ini, states, renou, is, not, an, impoverished, language, rather, it, is, a, controlled, and, a, restrained, language, from, which, archaisms, and, unnecessary, formal, alternatives, were, excluded, the, classical, form, of, the, language, simplified, the, sandhi, rules, but, retained, various, aspects, of, the, vedic, language, while, adding, rigor, and, flexibilities, so, that, it, had, sufficient, means, to, express, thoughts, as, well, as, being, capable, of, responding, to, the, future, increasing, demands, of, an, infinitely, diversified, literature, according, to, renou, p, ini, included, numerous, optional, rules, beyond, the, vedic, sanskrit, s, bahulam, framework, to, respect, liberty, and, creativity, so, that, individual, writers, separated, by, geography, or, time, would, have, the, choice, to, express, facts, and, their, views, in, their, own, way, where, tradition, followed, competitive, forms, of, the, sanskrit, language, the, phonetic, differences, between, vedic, sanskrit, and, classical, sanskrit, as, discerned, from, the, current, state, of, the, surviving, literature, are, negligible, when, compared, to, the, intense, change, that, must, have, occurred, in, the, pre, vedic, period, between, the, proto, indo, aryan, language, and, vedic, sanskrit, the, noticeable, differences, between, the, vedic, and, the, classical, sanskrit, include, the, much, expanded, grammar, and, grammatical, categories, as, well, as, the, differences, in, the, accent, the, semantics, and, the, syntax, there, are, also, some, differences, between, how, some, of, the, nouns, and, verbs, end, as, well, as, the, sandhi, rules, both, internal, and, external, quite, many, words, found, in, the, early, vedic, sanskrit, language, are, never, found, in, late, vedic, sanskrit, or, classical, sanskrit, literature, while, some, words, have, different, and, new, meanings, in, classical, sanskrit, when, contextually, compared, to, the, early, vedic, sanskrit, literature, arthur, macdonell, was, among, the, early, colonial, era, scholars, who, summarized, some, of, the, differences, between, the, vedic, and, classical, sanskrit, louis, renou, published, in, 1956, in, french, a, more, extensive, discussion, of, the, similarities, the, differences, and, the, evolution, of, the, vedic, sanskrit, within, the, vedic, period, and, then, to, the, classical, sanskrit, along, with, his, views, on, the, history, this, work, has, been, translated, by, jagbans, balbir, the, earliest, known, use, of, the, word, sa, sk, ta, sanskrit, in, the, context, of, a, speech, or, language, is, found, in, verses, 5, 28, 17, 19, of, the, ramayana, outside, the, learned, sphere, of, written, classical, sanskrit, vernacular, colloquial, dialects, prakrits, continued, to, evolve, sanskrit, co, existed, with, numerous, other, prakrit, languages, of, ancient, india, the, prakrit, languages, of, india, also, have, ancient, roots, and, some, sanskrit, scholars, have, called, these, apabhramsa, literally, spoiled, the, vedic, literature, includes, words, whose, phonetic, equivalent, are, not, found, in, other, indo, european, languages, but, which, are, found, in, the, regional, prakrit, languages, which, makes, it, likely, that, the, interaction, the, sharing, of, words, and, ideas, began, early, in, the, indian, history, as, the, indian, thought, diversified, and, challenged, earlier, beliefs, of, hinduism, particularly, in, the, form, of, buddhism, and, jainism, the, prakrit, languages, such, as, pali, in, theravada, buddhism, and, ardhamagadhi, in, jainism, competed, with, sanskrit, in, the, ancient, times, however, states, paul, dundas, a, scholar, of, jainism, these, ancient, prakrit, languages, had, roughly, the, same, relationship, to, sanskrit, as, medieval, italian, does, to, latin, the, indian, tradition, states, that, the, buddha, and, the, mahavira, preferred, the, prakrit, language, so, that, everyone, could, understand, it, however, scholars, such, as, dundas, have, questioned, this, hypothesis, they, state, that, there, is, no, evidence, for, this, and, whatever, evidence, is, available, suggests, that, by, the, start, of, the, common, era, hardly, anybody, other, than, learned, monks, had, the, capacity, to, understand, the, old, prakrit, languages, such, as, ardhamagadhi, colonial, era, scholars, questioned, whether, sanskrit, was, ever, a, spoken, language, or, just, a, literary, language, scholars, disagree, in, their, answers, a, section, of, western, scholars, state, that, sanskrit, was, never, a, spoken, language, while, others, and, particularly, most, indian, scholars, state, the, opposite, those, who, affirm, sanskrit, to, have, been, a, vernacular, language, point, to, the, necessity, of, sanskrit, being, a, spoken, language, for, the, oral, tradition, that, preserved, the, vast, number, of, sanskrit, manuscripts, from, ancient, india, secondly, they, state, that, the, textual, evidence, in, the, works, of, yaksa, panini, and, patanajali, affirms, that, the, classical, sanskrit, in, their, era, was, a, language, that, is, spoken, bhasha, by, the, cultured, and, educated, some, sutras, expound, upon, the, variant, forms, of, spoken, sanskrit, versus, written, sanskrit, the, 7th, century, chinese, buddhist, pilgrim, xuanzang, mentioned, in, his, memoir, that, official, philosophical, debates, in, india, were, held, in, sanskrit, not, in, the, vernacular, language, of, that, region, according, to, sanskrit, linguist, professor, madhav, deshpande, sanskrit, was, a, spoken, language, in, a, colloquial, form, by, the, mid, 1st, millennium, bce, which, coexisted, with, a, more, formal, grammatically, correct, form, of, literary, sanskrit, this, states, deshpande, is, true, for, modern, languages, where, colloquial, incorrect, approximations, and, dialects, of, a, language, are, spoken, and, understood, along, with, more, refined, sophisticated, and, grammatically, accurate, forms, of, the, same, language, being, found, in, the, literary, works, the, indian, tradition, states, winternitz, 1996, has, favored, the, learning, and, the, usage, of, multiple, languages, from, the, ancient, times, sanskrit, was, a, spoken, language, in, the, educated, and, the, elite, classes, but, it, was, also, a, language, that, must, have, been, understood, in, a, wider, circle, of, society, because, the, widely, popular, folk, epics, and, stories, such, as, the, ramayana, the, mahabharata, the, bhagavata, purana, the, panchatantra, and, many, other, texts, are, all, in, the, sanskrit, language, the, classical, sanskrit, with, its, exacting, grammar, was, thus, the, language, of, the, indian, scholars, and, the, educated, classes, while, others, communicated, with, approximate, or, ungrammatical, variants, of, it, as, well, as, other, natural, indian, languages, sanskrit, as, the, learned, language, of, ancient, india, thus, existed, alongside, the, vernacular, prakrits, many, sanskrit, dramas, indicate, that, the, language, coexisted, with, the, vernacular, prakrits, the, cities, of, varanasi, paithan, pune, and, kanchipuram, were, centers, of, classical, sanskrit, learning, and, public, debates, until, the, arrival, of, the, colonial, era, according, to, lamotte, 1976, an, indologist, and, buddhism, scholar, sanskrit, became, the, dominant, literary, and, inscriptional, language, because, of, its, precision, in, communication, it, was, states, lamotte, an, ideal, instrument, for, presenting, ideas, and, as, knowledge, in, sanskrit, multiplied, so, did, its, spread, and, influence, sanskrit, was, adopted, voluntarily, as, a, vehicle, of, high, culture, arts, and, profound, ideas, pollock, disagrees, with, lamotte, but, concurs, that, sanskrit, s, influence, grew, into, what, he, terms, a, sanskrit, cosmopolis, over, a, region, that, included, all, of, south, asia, and, much, of, southeast, asia, the, sanskrit, language, cosmopolis, thrived, beyond, india, between, 300, and, 1300, ce, today, it, is, believed, that, kashmiri, is, the, closest, language, to, sanskrit, rein, hl, mentions, that, not, only, have, the, dravidian, languages, borrowed, from, sanskrit, vocabulary, but, they, have, also, affected, sanskrit, on, deeper, levels, of, structure, for, instance, in, the, domain, of, phonology, where, indo, aryan, retroflexes, have, been, attributed, to, dravidian, influence, similarly, ferenc, ruzca, states, that, all, the, major, shifts, in, indo, aryan, phonetics, over, two, millennia, can, be, attributed, to, the, constant, influence, of, a, dravidian, language, with, a, similar, phonetic, structure, to, tamil, hock, et, al, quoting, george, hart, state, that, there, was, influence, of, old, tamil, on, sanskrit, hart, compared, old, tamil, and, classical, sanskrit, to, arrive, at, a, conclusion, that, there, was, a, common, language, from, which, these, features, both, derived, that, both, tamil, and, sanskrit, derived, their, shared, conventions, metres, and, techniques, from, a, common, source, for, it, is, clear, that, neither, borrowed, directly, from, the, other, rein, hl, further, states, that, there, is, a, symmetric, relationship, between, dravidian, languages, like, kannada, or, tamil, with, indo, aryan, languages, like, bengali, or, hindi, whereas, the, same, relationship, is, not, found, for, non, indo, aryan, languages, for, example, persian, or, english, a, sentence, in, a, dravidian, language, like, tamil, or, kannada, becomes, ordinarily, good, bengali, or, hindi, by, substituting, bengali, or, hindi, equivalents, for, the, dravidian, words, and, forms, without, modifying, the, word, order, but, the, same, thing, is, not, possible, in, rendering, a, persian, or, english, sentence, into, a, non, indo, aryan, language, shulman, mentions, that, dravidian, nonfinite, verbal, forms, called, vinaiyeccam, in, tamil, shaped, the, usage, of, the, sanskrit, nonfinite, verbs, originally, derived, from, inflected, forms, of, action, nouns, in, vedic, this, particularly, salient, case, of, the, possible, influence, of, dravidian, on, sanskrit, is, only, one, of, many, items, of, syntactic, assimilation, not, least, among, them, the, large, repertoire, of, morphological, modality, and, aspect, that, once, one, knows, to, look, for, it, can, be, found, everywhere, in, classical, and, postclassical, sanskrit, the, main, influence, of, dravidian, on, sanskrit, is, found, to, have, been, concentrated, in, the, timespan, between, the, late, vedic, period, and, the, crystallization, of, classical, sanskrit, as, in, this, period, the, indo, aryan, tribes, had, not, yet, made, contact, with, the, inhabitants, of, the, south, of, the, subcontinent, this, suggests, a, significant, presence, of, dravidian, speakers, in, north, india, the, central, gangetic, plain, and, the, classical, madhyade, a, who, were, instrumental, in, this, substratal, influence, on, sanskrit, extant,

the, predominant, language, of, one, of, the, largest, collection, of, historic, manuscripts, the, earliest, known, inscriptions, in, sanskrit, are, from, the, 1st, century, bce, such, as, the, ayodhya, inscription, of, dhana, and, ghosundi, hathibada, chittorgarh, though, developed, and, nurtured, by, scholars, of, orthodox, schools, of, hinduism, sanskrit, has, been, the, language, for, some, of, the, key, literary, works, and, theology, of, heterodox, schools, of, indian, philosophies, such, as, buddhism, and, jainism, the, structure, and, capabilities, of, the, classical, sanskrit, language, launched, ancient, indian, speculations, about, the, nature, and, function, of, language, what, is, the, relationship, between, words, and, their, meanings, in, the, context, of, a, community, of, speakers, whether, this, relationship, is, objective, or, subjective, discovered, or, is, created, how, individuals, learn, and, relate, to, the, world, around, them, through, language, and, about, the, limits, of, language, they, speculated, on, the, role, of, language, the, ontological, status, of, painting, word, images, through, sound, and, the, need, for, rules, so, that, it, can, serve, as, a, means, for, a, community, of, speakers, separated, by, geography, or, time, to, share, and, understand, profound, ideas, from, each, other, these, speculations, became, particularly, important, to, the, m, m, s, and, the, nyaya, schools, of, hindu, philosophy, and, later, to, vedanta, and, mahayana, buddhism, states, frits, staal, a, scholar, of, linguistics, with, a, focus, on, indian, philosophies, and, sanskrit, though, written, in, a, number, of, different, scripts, the, dominant, language, of, hindu, texts, has, been, sanskrit, it, or, a, hybrid, form, of, sanskrit, became, the, preferred, language, of, mahayana, buddhism, scholarship, for, example, one, of, the, early, and, influential, buddhist, philosophers, nagarjuna, 200, ce, used, classical, sanskrit, as, the, language, for, his, texts, according, to, renou, sanskrit, had, a, limited, role, in, the, theravada, tradition, formerly, known, as, the, hinayana, but, the, prakrit, works, that, have, survived, are, of, doubtful, authenticity, some, of, the, canonical, fragments, of, the, early, buddhist, traditions, discovered, in, the, 20th, century, suggest, the, early, buddhist, traditions, used, an, imperfect, and, reasonably, good, sanskrit, sometimes, with, a, pali, syntax, states, renou, the, mah, s, ghika, and, mahavastu, in, their, late, hinayana, forms, used, hybrid, sanskrit, for, their, literature, sanskrit, was, also, the, language, of, some, of, the, oldest, surviving, authoritative, and, much, followed, philosophical, works, of, jainism, such, as, the, tattvartha, sutra, by, umaswati, the, sanskrit, language, has, been, one, of, the, major, means, for, the, transmission, of, knowledge, and, ideas, in, asian, history, indian, texts, in, sanskrit, were, already, in, china, by, 402, ce, carried, by, the, influential, buddhist, pilgrim, faxian, who, translated, them, into, chinese, by, 418, ce, xuanzang, another, chinese, buddhist, pilgrim, learnt, sanskrit, in, india, and, carried, 657, sanskrit, texts, to, china, in, the, 7th, century, where, he, established, a, major, center, of, learning, and, language, translation, under, the, patronage, of, emperor, taizong, by, the, early, 1st, millennium, ce, sanskrit, had, spread, buddhist, and, hindu, ideas, to, southeast, asia, parts, of, the, east, asia, and, the, central, asia, it, was, accepted, as, a, language, of, high, culture, and, the, preferred, language, by, some, of, the, local, ruling, elites, in, these, regions, according, to, the, dalai, lama, the, sanskrit, language, is, a, parent, language, that, is, at, the, foundation, of, many, modern, languages, of, india, and, the, one, that, promoted, indian, thought, to, other, distant, countries, in, tibetan, buddhism, states, the, dalai, lama, sanskrit, language, has, been, a, revered, one, and, called, legjar, lhai, ka, or, elegant, language, of, the, gods, it, has, been, the, means, of, transmitting, the, profound, wisdom, of, buddhist, philosophy, to, tibet, the, sanskrit, language, created, a, pan, indo, aryan, accessibility, to, information, and, knowledge, in, the, ancient, and, medieval, times, in, contrast, to, the, prakrit, languages, which, were, understood, just, regionally, it, created, a, cultural, bond, across, the, subcontinent, as, local, languages, and, dialects, evolved, and, diversified, sanskrit, served, as, the, common, language, it, connected, scholars, from, distant, parts, of, south, asia, such, as, tamil, nadu, and, kashmir, states, deshpande, as, well, as, those, from, different, fields, of, studies, though, there, must, have, been, differences, in, its, pronunciation, given, the, first, language, of, the, respective, speakers, the, sanskrit, language, brought, indo, aryan, speaking, people, together, particularly, its, elite, scholars, some, of, these, scholars, of, indian, history, regionally, produced, vernacularized, sanskrit, to, reach, wider, audiences, as, evidenced, by, texts, discovered, in, rajasthan, gujarat, and, maharashtra, once, the, audience, became, familiar, with, the, easier, to, understand, vernacularized, version, of, sanskrit, those, interested, could, graduate, from, colloquial, sanskrit, to, the, more, advanced, classical, sanskrit, rituals, and, the, rites, of, passage, ceremonies, have, been, and, continue, to, be, the, other, occasions, where, a, wide, spectrum, of, people, hear, sanskrit, and, occasionally, join, in, to, speak, some, sanskrit, words, such, as, namah, classical, sanskrit, is, the, standard, register, as, laid, out, in, the, grammar, of, p, ini, around, the, fourth, century, bce, its, position, in, the, cultures, of, greater, india, is, akin, to, that, of, latin, and, ancient, greek, in, europe, sanskrit, has, significantly, influenced, most, modern, languages, of, the, indian, subcontinent, particularly, the, languages, of, the, northern, western, central, and, eastern, indian, subcontinent, sanskrit, declined, starting, about, and, after, the, 13th, century, this, coincides, with, the, beginning, of, islamic, invasions, of, south, asia, to, create, and, thereafter, expand, the, muslim, rule, in, the, form, of, sultanates, and, later, the, mughal, empire, sheldon, pollock, characterises, the, decline, of, sanskrit, as, a, long, term, cultural, social, and, political, change, he, dismisses, the, idea, that, sanskrit, declined, due, to, struggle, with, barbarous, invaders, and, emphasises, factors, such, as, the, increasing, attractiveness, of, vernacular, language, for, literary, expression, with, the, fall, of, kashmir, around, the, 13th, century, a, premier, center, of, sanskrit, literary, creativity, sanskrit, literature, there, disappeared, perhaps, in, the, fires, that, periodically, engulfed, the, capital, of, kashmir, or, the, mongol, invasion, of, 1320, states, pollock, the, sanskrit, literature, which, was, once, widely, disseminated, out, of, the, northwest, regions, of, the, subcontinent, stopped, after, the, 12th, century, as, hindu, kingdoms, fell, in, the, eastern, and, the, south, india, such, as, the, great, vijayanagara, empire, so, did, sanskrit, there, were, exceptions, and, short, periods, of, imperial, support, for, sanskrit, mostly, concentrated, during, the, reign, of, the, tolerant, mughal, emperor, akbar, muslim, rulers, patronized, the, middle, eastern, language, and, scripts, found, in, persia, and, arabia, and, the, indians, linguistically, adapted, to, this, persianization, to, gain, employment, with, the, muslim, rulers, hindu, rulers, such, as, shivaji, of, the, maratha, empire, reversed, the, process, by, re, adopting, sanskrit, and, re, asserting, their, socio, linguistic, identity, after, islamic, rule, disintegrated, in, south, asia, and, the, colonial, rule, era, began, sanskrit, re, emerged, but, in, the, form, of, a, ghostly, existence, in, regions, such, as, bengal, this, decline, was, the, result, of, political, institutions, and, civic, ethos, that, did, not, support, the, historic, sanskrit, literary, culture, and, the, failure, of, new, sanskrit, literature, to, assimilate, into, the, changing, cultural, and, political, environment, sheldon, pollock, states, that, in, some, crucial, way, sanskrit, is, dead, after, the, 12th, century, the, sanskrit, literary, works, were, reduced, to, reinscription, and, restatements, of, ideas, already, explored, and, any, creativity, was, restricted, to, hymns, and, verses, this, contrasted, with, the, previous, 1, 500, years, when, great, experiments, in, moral, and, aesthetic, imagination, marked, the, indian, scholarship, using, classical, sanskrit, states, pollock, scholars, maintain, that, the, sanskrit, language, did, not, die, but, rather, only, declined, jurgen, hanneder, disagrees, with, pollock, finding, his, arguments, elegant, but, often, arbitrary, according, to, hanneder, a, decline, or, regional, absence, of, creative, and, innovative, literature, constitutes, a, negative, evidence, to, pollock, s, hypothesis, but, it, is, not, positive, evidence, a, closer, look, at, sanskrit, in, the, indian, history, after, the, 12th, century, suggests, that, sanskrit, survived, despite, the, odds, according, to, hanneder, on, a, more, public, level, the, statement, that, sanskrit, is, a, dead, language, is, misleading, for, sanskrit, is, quite, obviously, not, as, dead, as, other, dead, languages, and, the, fact, that, it, is, spoken, written, and, read, will, probably, convince, most, people, that, it, cannot, be, a, dead, language, in, the, most, common, usage, of, the, term, pollock, s, notion, of, the, death, of, sanskrit, remains, in, this, unclear, realm, between, academia, and, public, opinion, when, he, says, that, most, observers, would, agree, that, in, some, crucial, way, sanskrit, is, dead, the, sanskrit, language, scholar, moriz, winternitz, states, sanskrit, was, never, a, dead, language, and, it, is, still, alive, though, its, prevalence, is, lesser, than, ancient, and, medieval, times, sanskrit, remains, an, integral, part, of, hindu, journals, festivals, ramlila, plays, drama, rituals, and, the, rites, of, passage, similarly, brian, hatcher, states, that, the, metaphors, of, historical, rupture, by, pollock, are, not, valid, that, there, is, ample, proof, that, sanskrit, was, very, much, alive, in, the, narrow, confines, of, surviving, hindu, kingdoms, between, the, 13th, and, 18th, centuries, and, its, reverence, and, tradition, continues, hanneder, states, that, modern, works, in, sanskrit, are, either, ignored, or, their, modernity, contested, according, to, robert, p, goldman, and, sally, sutherland, sanskrit, is, neither, dead, nor, living, in, the, conventional, sense, it, is, a, special, timeless, language, that, lives, in, the, numerous, manuscripts, daily, chants, and, ceremonial, recitations, a, heritage, language, that, indians, contextually, prize, and, which, some, practice, when, the, british, introduced, english, to, india, in, the, 19th, century, knowledge, of, sanskrit, and, ancient, literature, continued, to, flourish, as, the, study, of, sanskrit, changed, from, a, more, traditional, style, into, a, form, of, analytical, and, comparative, scholarship, mirroring, that, of, europe, the, relationship, of, sanskrit, to, the, prakrit, languages, particularly, the, modern, form, of, indian, languages, is, complex, and, spans, about, 3, 500, years, states, colin, masica, a, linguist, specializing, in, south, asian, languages, a, part, of, the, difficulty, is, the, lack, of, sufficient, textual, archaeological, and, epigraphical, evidence, for, the, ancient, prakrit, languages, with, rare, exceptions, such, as, pali, leading, to, a, tendency, toward, anachronistic, errors, sanskrit, and, prakrit, languages, may, be, divided, into, old, indo, aryan, 1500, bce, 600, bce, middle, indo, aryan, 600, bce, 1000, ce, and, new, indo, aryan, 1000, ce, present, each, can, further, be, subdivided, into, early, middle, or, second, and, late, evolutionary, substages, vedic, sanskrit, belongs, to, the, early, old, indo, aryan, stage, while, classical, sanskrit, to, the, later, old, indo, aryan, stage, the, evidence, for, prakrits, such, as, pali, theravada, buddhism, and, ardhamagadhi, jainism, along, with, magadhi, maharashtri, sinhala, sauraseni, and, niya, gandhari, emerge, in, the, middle, indo, aryan, stage, in, two, versions, archaic, and, more, formalized, that, may, be, placed, in, early, and, middle, substages, of, the, 600, bce, 1000, ce, period, two, literary, indo, aryan, languages, can, be, traced, to, the, late, middle, indo, aryan, stage, and, these, are, apabhramsa, and, elu, a, literary, form, of, sinhalese, numerous, north, central, eastern, and, western, indian, languages, such, as, hindi, gujarati, sindhi, punjabi, kashmiri, nepali, braj, awadhi, bengali, assamese, oriya, marathi, and, others, belong, to, the, new, indo, aryan, stage, there, is, an, extensive, overlap, in, the, vocabulary, phonetics, and, other, aspects, of, these, new, indo, aryan, languages, with, sanskrit, but, it, is, neither, universal, nor, identical, across, the, languages, they, likely, emerged, from, a, synthesis, of, the, ancient, sanskrit, language, traditions, and, an, admixture, of, various, regional, dialects, each, language, has, some, unique, and, regionally, creative, aspects, with, unclear, origins, prakrit, languages, do, have, a, grammatical, structure, but, like, vedic, sanskrit, it, is, far, less, rigorous, than, classical, sanskrit, while, the, roots, of, all, prakrit, languages, may, be, in, vedic, sanskrit, and, ultimately, the, proto, indo, aryan, language, their, structural, details, vary, from, classical, sanskrit, it, is, generally, accepted, by, scholars, and, widely, believed, in, india, that, the, modern, indo, aryan, languages, such, as, bengali, gujarati, hindi, and, punjabi, are, descendants, of, the, sanskrit, language, sanskrit, states, burjor, avari, can, be, described, as, the, mother, language, of, almost, all, the, languages, of, north, india, the, sanskrit, language, s, historic, presence, is, attested, across, a, wide, geography, beyond, south, asia, inscriptions, and, literary, evidence, suggests, that, sanskrit, language, was, already, being, adopted, in, southeast, asia, and, central, asia, in, the, 1st, millennium, ce, through, monks, religious, pilgrims, and, merchants, south, asia, has, been, the, geographic, range, of, the, largest, collection, of, the, ancient, and, pre, 18th, century, sanskrit, manuscripts, and, inscriptions,

india, to, do, so, sanskrit, shares, many, proto, indo, european, phonological, features, although, it, features, a, larger, inventory, of, distinct, phonemes, the, consonantal, system, is, the, same, though, it, systematically, enlarged, the, inventory, of, distinct, sounds, for, example, sanskrit, added, a, voiceless, aspirated, t, to, the, voiceless, t, voiced, d, and, voiced, aspirated, d, found, in, pie, languages, the, most, significant, and, distinctive, phonological, development, in, sanskrit, is, vowel, merger, the, short, e, o, and, a, all, merge, as, a, in, sanskrit, while, long, and, all, merge, as, long, compare, sanskrit, n, man, to, latin, n, men, these, mergers, occurred, very, early, and, significantly, affected, sanskrit, s, morphological, system, some, phonological, developments, in, it, mirror, those, in, other, pie, languages, for, example, the, labiovelars, merged, with, the, plain, velars, as, in, other, satem, languages, the, secondary, palatalization, of, the, resulting, segments, is, more, thorough, and, systematic, within, sanskrit, for, example, unlike, the, loss, of, the, morphological, clarity, from, vowel, contraction, that, is, found, in, early, greek, and, related, southeast, european, languages, sanskrit, deployed, y, w, and, s, intervocalically, to, provide, morphological, clarity, the, cardinal, vowels, svaras, i, u, a, distinguish, length, in, sanskrit, the, short, a, in, sanskrit, is, a, closer, vowel, than, equivalent, to, schwa, the, mid, vowels, and, in, sanskrit, are, monophthongizations, of, the, indo, iranian, diphthongs, ai, and, au, the, old, iranian, language, preserved, ai, and, au, the, sanskrit, vowels, are, inherently, long, though, often, transcribed, e, and, o, without, the, diacritic, the, vocalic, liquid, r, in, sanskrit, is, a, merger, of, pie, r, and, l, the, long, r, is, an, innovation, and, it, is, used, in, a, few, analogically, generated, morphological, categories, according, to, masica, sanskrit, has, four, traditional, semivowels, with, which, were, classed, for, morphophonemic, reasons, the, liquids, y, r, l, and, v, that, is, as, y, and, v, were, the, non, syllabics, corresponding, to, i, u, so, were, r, l, in, relation, to, r, and, l, the, northwestern, the, central, and, the, eastern, sanskrit, dialects, have, had, a, historic, confusion, between, r, and, l, the, paninian, system, that, followed, the, central, dialect, preserved, the, distinction, likely, out, of, reverence, for, the, vedic, sanskrit, that, distinguished, the, r, and, l, however, the, northwestern, dialect, only, had, r, while, the, eastern, dialect, probably, only, had, l, states, masica, thus, literary, works, from, different, parts, of, ancient, india, appear, inconsistent, in, their, use, of, r, and, l, resulting, in, doublets, that, are, occasionally, semantically, differentiated, sanskrit, possesses, a, symmetric, consonantal, phoneme, structure, based, on, how, the, sound, is, articulated, though, the, actual, usage, of, these, sounds, conceals, the, lack, of, parallelism, in, the, apparent, symmetry, possibly, from, historical, changes, within, the, language, sanskrit, had, a, series, of, retroflex, stops, originating, as, conditioned, alternants, of, dentals, albeit, by, sanskrit, they, had, become, phonemic, regarding, the, palatal, plosives, the, pronunciation, is, a, matter, of, debate, in, contemporary, attestation, the, palatal, plosives, are, a, regular, series, of, palatal, stops, supported, by, most, sanskrit, sandhi, rules, however, the, reflexes, in, descendant, languages, as, well, as, a, few, of, the, sandhi, rules, regarding, ch, could, suggest, an, affricate, pronunciation, jh, was, a, marginal, phoneme, in, sanskrit, hence, its, phonology, is, more, difficult, to, reconstruct, it, was, more, commonly, employed, in, the, middle, indo, aryan, languages, as, a, result, of, phonological, processes, resulting, in, the, phoneme, the, palatal, nasal, is, a, conditioned, variant, of, n, occurring, next, to, palatal, obstruents, the, anusvara, that, sanskrit, deploys, is, a, conditioned, alternant, of, postvocalic, nasals, under, certain, sandhi, conditions, its, visarga, is, a, word, final, or, morpheme, final, conditioned, alternant, of, s, and, r, under, certain, sandhi, conditions, the, system, of, sanskrit, sounds, order, of, sanskrit, sounds, works, along, three, principles, it, goes, from, simple, to, complex, it, goes, from, the, back, to, the, front, of, the, mouth, and, it, groups, similar, sounds, together, among, themselves, both, the, vowels, and, consonants, are, ordered, according, to, where, in, the, mouth, they, are, pronounced, going, from, back, to, front, a, m, ruppel, the, cambridge, introduction, to, sanskrit, the, voiceless, aspirated, series, is, also, an, innovation, in, sanskrit, but, is, significantly, rarer, than, the, other, three, series, while, the, sanskrit, language, organizes, sounds, for, expression, beyond, those, found, in, the, pie, language, it, retained, many, features, found, in, the, iranian, and, balto, slavic, languages, an, example, of, a, similar, process, in, all, three, is, the, retroflex, sibilant, being, the, automatic, product, of, dental, s, following, i, u, r, and, k, sanskrit, deploys, extensive, phonological, alternations, on, different, linguistic, levels, through, sandhi, rules, literally, the, rules, of, putting, together, union, connection, alliance, similar, to, the, english, alteration, of, going, to, as, gonna, the, sanskrit, language, accepts, such, alterations, within, it, but, offers, formal, rules, for, the, sandhi, of, any, two, words, next, to, each, other, in, the, same, sentence, or, linking, two, sentences, the, external, sandhi, rules, state, that, similar, short, vowels, coalesce, into, a, single, long, vowel, while, dissimilar, vowels, form, glides, or, undergo, diphthongization, among, the, consonants, most, external, sandhi, rules, recommend, regressive, assimilation, for, clarity, when, they, are, voiced, these, rules, ordinarily, apply, at, compound, seams, and, morpheme, boundaries, in, vedic, sanskrit, the, external, sandhi, rules, are, more, variable, than, in, classical, sanskrit, the, internal, sandhi, rules, are, more, intricate, and, account, for, the, root, and, the, canonical, structure, of, the, sanskrit, word, these, rules, anticipate, what, are, now, known, as, the, bartholomae, s, law, and, grassmann, s, law, for, example, states, jamison, the, voiceless, voiced, and, voiced, aspirated, obstruents, of, a, positional, series, regularly, alternate, with, each, other, p, b, bh, t, d, dh, etc, note, however, c, j, h, such, that, for, example, a, morpheme, with, an, underlying, voiced, aspirate, final, may, show, alternants, with, all, three, stops, under, differing, internal, sandhi, conditions, the, velar, series, k, g, g, alternate, with, the, palatal, series, c, j, h, while, the, structural, position, of, the, palatal, series, is, modified, into, a, retroflex, cluster, when, followed, by, dental, this, rule, creates, two, morphophonemically, distinct, series, from, a, single, palatal, series, vocalic, alternations, in, the, sanskrit, morphological, system, is, termed, strengthening, and, called, gu, a, and, vr, ddhi, in, the, preconsonantal, versions, there, is, an, equivalence, to, terms, deployed, in, indo, european, descriptive, grammars, wherein, sanskrit, s, unstrengthened, state, is, same, as, the, zero, grade, gu, a, corresponds, to, normal, grade, while, vr, ddhi, is, same, as, the, lengthened, state, the, qualitative, ablaut, is, not, found, in, sanskrit, just, like, it, is, absent, in, iranian, but, sanskrit, retains, quantitative, ablaut, through, vowel, strengthening, the, transformations, between, unstrengthened, to, gu, a, is, prominent, in, the, morphological, system, states, jamison, while, vr, ddhi, is, a, particularly, significant, rule, when, adjectives, of, origin, and, appurtenance, are, derived, the, manner, in, which, this, is, done, slightly, differs, between, the, vedic, and, the, classical, sanskrit, sanskrit, grants, a, very, flexible, syllable, structure, where, they, may, begin, or, end, with, vowels, be, single, consonants, or, clusters, similarly, the, syllable, may, have, an, internal, vowel, of, any, weight, vedic, sanskrit, shows, traces, of, following, the, sievers, edgerton, law, but, classical, sanskrit, does, not, vedic, sanskrit, has, a, pitch, accent, system, inherited, from, proto, indo, european, which, was, acknowledged, by, p, ini, states, jamison, but, in, his, classical, sanskrit, the, accents, disappear, most, vedic, sanskrit, words, have, one, accent, however, this, accent, is, not, phonologically, predictable, states, jamison, it, can, fall, anywhere, in, the, word, and, its, position, often, conveys, morphological, and, syntactic, information, the, presence, of, an, accent, system, in, vedic, sanskrit, is, evidenced, from, the, markings, in, the, vedic, texts, this, is, important, because, of, sanskrit, s, connection, to, the, pie, languages, and, comparative, indo, european, linguistics, sanskrit, like, most, early, indo, european, languages, lost, the, so, called, laryngeal, consonants, cover, symbol, h, present, in, the, proto, indo, european, states, jamison, this, significantly, affected, the, evolutionary, path, of, the, sanskrit, phonology, and, morphology, particularly, in, the, variant, forms, of, roots, because, sanskrit, is, not, anyone, s, native, language, it, does, not, have, a, fixed, pronunciation, people, tend, to, pronounce, it, as, they, do, their, native, language, the, articles, on, hindustani, marathi, nepali, oriya, and, bengali, phonology, will, give, some, indication, of, the, variation, that, is, encountered, when, sanskrit, was, a, spoken, language, its, pronunciation, varied, regionally, and, also, over, time, nonetheless, panini, described, the, sound, system, of, sanskrit, well, enough, that, people, have, a, fairly, good, idea, of, what, he, intended, the, basis, of, sanskrit, morphology, is, the, root, states, jamison, a, morpheme, bearing, lexical, meaning, the, verbal, and, nominal, stems, of, sanskrit, words, are, derived, from, this, root, through, the, phonological, vowel, gradation, processes, the, addition, of, affixes, verbal, and, nominal, stems, it, then, adds, an, ending, to, establish, the, grammatical, and, syntactic, identity, of, the, stem, according, to, jamison, the, three, major, formal, elements, of, the, morphology, are, i, root, ii, affix, and, iii, ending, and, they, are, roughly, responsible, for, i, lexical, meaning, ii, derivation, and, iii, inflection, respectively, a, sanskrit, word, has, the, following, canonical, structure, the, root, structure, has, certain, phonological, constraints, two, of, the, most, important, constraints, of, a, root, is, that, it, does, not, end, in, a, short, a, and, that, it, is, monosyllabic, in, contrast, the, affixes, and, endings, commonly, do, the, affixes, in, sanskrit, are, almost, always, suffixes, with, exceptions, such, as, the, augment, a, added, as, prefix, to, past, tense, verb, forms, and, the, na, n, infix, in, single, verbal, present, class, states, jamison, sanskrit, verbs, have, the, following, canonical, structure, according, to, ruppel, verbs, in, sanskrit, express, the, same, information, as, other, indo, european, languages, such, as, english, sanskrit, verbs, describe, an, action, or, occurrence, or, state, its, embedded, morphology, informs, as, to, who, is, doing, it, person, or, persons, when, it, is, done, tense, and, how, it, is, done, mood, voice, the, indo, european, languages, differ, in, the, detail, for, example, the, sanskrit, language, attaches, the, affixes, and, ending, to, the, verb, root, while, the, english, language, adds, small, independent, words, before, the, verb, in, sanskrit, these, elements, co, exist, within, the, word, both, verbs, and, nouns, in, sanskrit, are, either, thematic, or, athematic, states, jamison, guna, strengthened, forms, in, the, active, singular, regularly, alternate, in, athematic, verbs, the, finite, verbs, of, classical, sanskrit, have, the, following, grammatical, categories, person, number, voice, tense, aspect, and, mood, according, to, jamison, a, portmanteau, morpheme, generally, expresses, the, person, number, voice, in, sanskrit, and, sometimes, also, the, ending, or, only, the, ending, the, mood, of, the, word, is, embedded, in, the, affix, these, elements, of, word, architecture, are, the, typical, building, blocks, in, classical, sanskrit, but, in, vedic, sanskrit, these, elements, fluctuate, and, are, unclear, for, example, in, the, rigveda, preverbs, regularly, occur, in, tmesis, states, jamison, which, means, they, are, separated, from, the, finite, verb, this, indecisiveness, is, likely, linked, to, vedic, sanskrit, s, attempt, to, incorporate, accent, with, nonfinite, forms, of, the, verb, and, with, nominal, derivatives, thereof, states, jamison, preverbs, show, much, clearer, univerbation, in, vedic, both, by, position, and, by, accent, and, by, classical, sanskrit, tmesis, is, no, longer, possible, even, with, finite, forms, while, roots, are, typical, in, sanskrit, some, words, do, not, follow, the, canonical, structure, a, few, forms, lack, both, inflection, and, root, many, words, are, inflected, and, can, enter, into, derivation, but, lack, a, recognizable, root, examples, from, the, basic, vocabulary, include, kinship, terms, such, as, m, tar, mother, nas, nose, van, dog, according, to, jamison, pronouns, and, some, words, outside, the, semantic, categories, also, lack, roots, as, do, the, numerals, similarly, the, sanskrit, language, is, flexible, enough, to, not, mandate, inflection, the, sanskrit, words, can, contain, more, than, one, affix, that, interact, with, each, other, affixes, in, sanskrit, can, be, athematic, as, well, as, thematic, according, to, jamison, athematic, affixes, can, be, alternating, sanskrit, deploys, eight, cases, namely, nominative, accusative, instrumental, dative, ablative, genitive, locative, vocative, stems, that, is, root, affix, appear, in, two, categories, in, sanskrit, vowel, stems, and, consonant, stems, unlike, some, indo, european, languages, such, as, latin, or, greek, according, to, jamison, sanskrit, has, no, closed, set, of, conventionally, denoted, noun, declensions, sanskrit, includes, a, fairly, large, set, of, stem, types, the, linguistic, interaction, of, the, roots, the, phonological, segments, lexical, items, and, the, grammar, for, the, classical, sanskrit, consist, of, four, paninian, components, these, states, paul, kiparsky, are, the, astadhyaayi, a, comprehensive, system, of, 4, 000, grammatical, rules, of, which, a, small, set, are, frequently, used, sivasutras, an, inventory, of, anubandhas, markers, that, partition, phonological, segments, for, efficient, abbreviations, through, the, pratyharas, technique, dhatupatha, a, list, of, 2, 000, verbal, roots, classified, by, their, morphology, and, syntactic, properties, using, diacritic, markers, a, structure, that, guides, its, writing, systems, and, the, ganapatha, an, inventory, of, word, groups, classes, of, lexical, systems, there, are, peripheral, adjuncts, to, these, four, such, as, the, unadisutras, which, focus, on, irregularly, formed, derivatives, from, the, roots, sanskrit, morphology, is, generally, studied, in, two, broad, fundamental, categories, the, nominal, forms, and, the, verbal, forms, these, differ, in, the, types, of, endings, and, what, these, endings, mark, in, the, grammatical, context, pronouns, and, nouns, share, the, same, grammatical, categories, though, they, may, differ, in, inflection, verb, based, adjectives, and, participles, are, not, formally, distinct, from, nouns, adverbs, are, typically, frozen, case, forms, of, adjectives, states, jamison, and, nonfinite, verbal, forms, such, as, infinitives, and, gerunds, also, clearly, show, frozen, nominal, case, endings, the, sanskrit, language, includes, five, tenses, present, future, past, imperfect, past, aorist, and, past, perfect, it, outlines, three, types, of, voices, active, passive, and, the, middle, the, middle, is, also, referred, to, as, the, mediopassive, or, more, formally, in, sanskrit, as, parasmaipada, word, for, another, and, atmanepada, word, for, oneself, the, paradigm, for, the, tense, aspect, system, in, sanskrit, is, the, three, way, contrast, between, the, present, the, aorist, and, the, perfect, architecture, vedic, sanskrit, is, more, elaborate, and, had, several, additional, tenses, for, example, the, rigveda, includes, perfect, and, a, marginal, pluperfect, classical, sanskrit, simplifies, the, present, system, down, to, two, tenses, the, perfect, and, the, imperfect, while, the, aorist, stems, retain, the, aorist, tense, and, the, perfect, stems, retain, the, perfect, and, marginal, pluperfect, the, classical, version, of, the, language, has, elaborate, rules, for, both, voice, and, the, tense, aspect, system, to, emphasize, clarity, and, this, is, more, elaborate, than, in, other, indo, european, languages, the, evolution, of, these, systems, can, be, seen, from, the, earliest, layers, of, the, vedic, literature, to, the, late, vedic, literature, sanskrit, recognizes, three, numbers, singular, dual, and, plural, the, dual, is, a, fully, functioning, category, used, beyond, naturally, paired, objects, such, as, hands, or, eyes, extending, to, any, collection, of, two, the, elliptical, dual, is, notable, in, the, vedic, sanskrit, according, to, jamison, where, a, noun, in, the, dual, signals, a, paired, opposition, illustrations, include, dy, v, literally, the, two, heavens, for, heaven, and, earth, m, tar, literally, the, two, mothers, for, mother, and, father, a, verb, may, be, singular, dual, or, plural, while, the, person, recognized, in, the, language, are, forms, of, i, you, he, she, it, we, and, they, there, are, three, persons, in, sanskrit, first, second, and, third, sanskrit, uses, the, 3, 3, grid, formed, by, the, three, numbers, and, the, three, persons, parameters, as, the, paradigm, and, the, basic, building, block, of, its, verbal, system, the, sanskrit, language, incorporates, three, genders, feminine, masculine, and, neuter, all, nouns, have, inherent, gender, with, some, exceptions, personal, pronouns, have, no, gender, exceptions, include, demonstrative, and, anaphoric, pronouns, derivation, of, a, word, is, used, to, express, the, feminine, two, most, common, derivations, come, from, feminine, forming, suffixes, the, r, dh, and, rukm, n, the, masculine, and, neuter, are, much, simpler, and, the, difference, between, them, is, primarily, inflectional, similar, affixes, for, the, feminine, are, found, in, many, indo, european, languages, states, burrow, suggesting, links, of, the, sanskrit, to, its, pie, heritage, pronouns, in, sanskrit, include, the, personal, pronouns, of, the, first, and, second, persons, unmarked, for, gender, and, a, larger, number, of, gender, distinguishing, pronouns, and, adjectives, examples, of, the, former, include, ah, m, first, singular, vay, m, first, plural, and, y, y, m, second, plural, the, latter, can, be, demonstrative, deictic, or, anaphoric, both, the, vedic, and, classical, sanskrit, share, the, s, t, m, pronominal, stem, and, this, is, the, closest, element, to, a, third, person, pronoun, and, an, article, in, the, sanskrit, language, states, jamison, indicative, potential, and, imperative, are, the, three, mood, forms, in, sanskrit, the, sanskrit, language, formally, incorporates, poetic, metres, by, the, late, vedic, era, this, developed, into, a, field, of, study, it, was, central, to, the, composition, of, the, hindu, literature, including, the, later, vedic, texts, this, study, of, sanskrit, prosody, is, called, chandas, and, is, considered, one, of, the, six, vedangas, or, limbs, of, vedic, studies, sanskrit, prosody, includes, linear, and, non, linear, systems, the, system, started, off, with, seven, major, metres, according, to, annette, wilke, and, oliver, moebus, called, the, seven, birds, or, seven, mouths, of, brihaspati, and, each, had, its, own, rhythm, movements, and, aesthetics, wherein, a, non, linear, structure, aperiodicity, was, mapped, into, a, four, verse, polymorphic, linear, sequence, a, syllable, in, sanskrit, is, classified, as, either, laghu, light, or, guru, heavy, this, classification, is, based, on, a, matra, literally, count, measure, duration, and, typically, a, syllable, that, ends, in, a, short, vowel, is, a, light, syllable, while, those, that, end, in, consonant, anusvara, or, visarga, are, heavy, the, classical, sanskrit, found, in, hindu, scriptures, such, as, the, bhagavad, gita, and, many, texts, are, so, arranged, that, the, light, and, heavy, syllables, in, them, follow, a, rhythm, though, not, necessarily, a, rhyme, sanskrit, metres, include, those, based, on, a, fixed, number, of, syllables, per, verse, and, those, based, on, fixed, number, of, morae, per, verse, the, vedic, sanskrit, employs, fifteen, metres, of, which, seven, are, common, and, the, most, frequent, are, three, 8, 11, and, 12, syllable, lines, the, classical, sanskrit, deploys, both, linear, and, non, linear, metres, many, of, which, are, based, on, syllables, and, others, based, on, diligently, crafted, verses, based, on, repeating, numbers, of, morae, matra, per, foot, there, is, no, word, without, metre, nor, is, there, any, metre, without, words, natya, shastra, metre, and, rhythm, is, an, important, part, of, the, sanskrit, language, it, may, have, played, a, role, in, helping, preserve, the, integrity, of, the, message, and, sanskrit, texts, the, verse, perfection, in, the, vedic, texts, such, as, the, verse, upanishads, and, post, vedic, sm, ti, texts, are, rich, in, prosody, this, feature, of, the, sanskrit, language, led, some, indologists, from, the, 19th, century, onwards, to, identify, suspected, portions, of, texts, where, a, line, or, sections, are, off, the, expected, metre, the, metre, feature, of, the, sanskrit, language, embeds, another, layer, of, communication, to, the, listener, or, reader, a, change, in, metres, has, been, a, tool, of, literary, architecture, and, an, embedded, code, to, inform, the, reciter, and, audience, that, it, marks, the, end, of, a, section, or, chapter, each, section, or, chapter, of, these, texts, uses, identical, metres, rhythmically, presenting, their, ideas, and, making, it, easier, to, remember, recall, and, check, for, accuracy, authors, coded, a, hymn, s, end, by, frequently, using, a, verse, of, a, metre, different, from, that, used, in, the, hymn, s, body, however, hindu, tradition, does, not, use, the, gayatri, metre, to, end, a, hymn, or, composition, possibly, because, it, has, enjoyed, a, special, level, of, reverence, in, hinduism, the, early, history, of, writing, sanskrit, and, other, languages, in, ancient, india, is, a, problematic, topic, despite, a, century, of, scholarship, states, richard, salomon, an, epigraphist, and, indologist, specializing, in, sanskrit, and, pali, literature, the, earliest, possible, script, from, south, asia, is, from, the, indus, valley, civilization, 3rd, 2nd, millennium, bce, but, this, script, if, it, is, a, script, remains, undeciphered, if, any, scripts, existed, in, the, vedic, period, they, have, not, survived, scholars, generally, accept, that, sanskrit, was, spoken, in, an, oral, society, and, that, an, oral, tradition, preserved, the, extensive, vedic, and, classical, sanskrit, literature, other, scholars, such, as, jack, goody, argue, that, the, vedic, sanskrit, texts, are, not, the, product, of, an, oral, society, basing, this, view, by, comparing, inconsistencies, in, the, transmitted, versions, of, literature, from, various, oral, societies, such, as, the, greek, greco, sanskrit, serbian, and, other, cultures, this, minority, of, scholars, argue, that, the, vedic, literature, is, too, consistent, and, vast, to, have, been, composed, and, transmitted, orally, across, generations, without, having, been, written, down, lipi, is, the, term, in, sanskrit, which, means, writing, letters, alphabet, it, contextually, refers, to, scripts, the, art, or, any, manner, of, writing, or, drawing, the, term, in, the, sense, of, a, writing, system, appears, in, some, of, the, earliest, buddhist, hindu, and, jaina, texts, p, ini, s, astadhyayi, composed, sometime, around, the, 5th, or, 4th, century, bce, for, example, mentions, lipi, in, the, context, of, a, writing, script, and, education, system, in, his, times, but, he, does, not, name, the, script, several, early, buddhist, and, jaina, texts, such, as, the, lalitavistara, s, tra, and, pannavana, sutta, include, lists, of, numerous, writing, scripts, in, ancient, india, the, buddhist, texts, list, the, sixty, four, lipi, that, the, buddha, knew, as, a, child, with, the, brahmi, script, topping, the, list, the, historical, value, of, this, list, is, however, limited, by, several, factors, states, salomon, the, list, may, be, a, later, interpolation, the, jain, canonical, texts, such, as, the, pannavana, sutta, probably, older, than, the, buddhist, texts, list, eighteen, writing, systems, with, the, brahmi, topping, the, list, and, kharotthi, kharoshthi, listed, as, fourth, the, jaina, text, elsewhere, states, that, the, brahmi, is, written, in, 18, different, forms, but, the, details, are, lacking, however, the, reliability, of, these, lists, has, been, questioned, and, the, empirical, evidence, of, writing, systems, in, the, form, of, sanskrit, or, prakrit, inscriptions, dated, prior, to, the, 3rd, century, bce, has, not, been, found, if, the, ancient, surfaces, for, writing, sanskrit, were, palm, leaves, tree, bark, and, cloth, the, same, as, those, in, later, times, these, have, not, survived, according, to, salomon, many, find, it, difficult, to, explain, the, evidently, high, level, of, political, organization, and, cultural, complexity, of, ancient, india, without, a, writing, system, for, sanskrit, and, other, languages, the, oldest, datable, writing, systems, for, sanskrit, are, the, br, hm, script, the, related, kharo, h, script, and, the, brahmi, derivatives, the, kharosthi, was, used, in, the, northwestern, part, of, south, asia, and, it, became, extinct, while, the, brahmi, was, used, all, over, the, subcontinent, along, with, regional, scripts, such, as, old, tamil, of, these, the, earliest, records, in, the, sanskrit, language, are, in, brahmi, a, script, that, later, evolved, into, numerous, related, indic, scripts, for, sanskrit, along, with, southeast, asian, scripts, burmese, thai, lao, khmer, others, and, many, extinct, central, asian, scripts, such, as, those, discovered, along, with, the, kharosthi, in, the, tarim, basin, of, western, china, and, in, uzbekistan, the, most, extensive, inscriptions, that, have, survived, into, the, modern, era, are, the, rock, edicts, and, pillar, inscriptions, of, the, 3rd, century, bce, mauryan, emperor, ashoka, but, these, are, not, in, sanskrit, over, the, centuries, and, across, countries, a, number, of, scripts, have, been, used, to, write, sanskrit, the, brahmi, script, for, writing, sanskrit, is, a, modified, consonant, syllabic, script, the, graphic, syllable, is, its, basic, unit, and, this, consists, of, a, consonant, with, or, without, diacritic, modifications, since, the, vowel, is, an, integral, part, of, the, consonants, and, given, the, efficiently, compacted, fused, consonant, cluster, morphology, for, sanskrit, words, and, grammar, the, brahmi, and, its, derivative, writing, systems, deploy, ligatures, diacritics, and, relative, positioning, of, the, vowel, to, inform, the, reader, how, the, vowel, is, related, to, the, consonant, and, how, it, is, expected, to, be, pronounced, for, clarity, this, feature, of, brahmi, and, its, modern, indic, script, derivatives, makes, it, difficult, to, classify, it, under, the, main, script, types, used, for, the, writing, systems, for, most, of, the, world, s, languages, namely, logographic, syllabic, and, alphabetic, the, brahmi, script, evolved, into, a, vast, number, of, forms, and, derivatives, states, richard, salomon, and, in, theory, sanskrit, can, be, represented, in, virtually, any, of, the, main, brahmi, based, scripts, and, in, practice, it, often, is, from, the, ancient, times, it, has, been, written, in, numerous, regional, scripts, in, south, and, southeast, asia, most, of, these, are, descendants, of, the, brahmi, script, the, earliest, datable, varnamala, brahmi, alphabet, system, found, in, later, sanskrit, texts, is, from, the, 2nd, century, bce, in, the, form, of, a, terracotta, plaque, found, in, sughana, haryana, it, shows, a, schoolboy, s, writing, lessons, states, salomon, many, modern, era, manuscripts, are, written, and, available, in, the, nagari, script, whose, form, is, attestable, to, the, 1st, millennium, ce, the, nagari, script, is, the, ancestor, of, devanagari, north, india, nandinagari, south, india, and, other, variants, the, n, gar, script, was, in, regular, use, by, 7th, century, ce, and, had, fully, evolved, into, devanagari, and, nandinagari, scripts, by, about, the, end, of, the, first, millennium, of, the, common, era, the, devanagari, script, states, banerji, became, more, popular, for, sanskrit, in, india, since, about, the, 18th, century, however, sanskrit, does, have, special, historical, connection, to, the, nagari, script, as, attested, by, the, epigraphical, evidence, the, nagari, script, has, been, thought, of, as, a, northern, indic, script, for, sanskrit, as, well, as, the, regional, languages, such, as, hindi, marathi, and, nepali, however, it, has, had, a, supra, local, status, as, evidenced, by, 1st, millennium, ce, epigraphy, and, manuscripts, discovered, all, over, india, and, as, far,

sanskrit, these, and, many, indian, scripts, look, different, to, the, untrained, eye, but, the, differences, between, indic, scripts, is, mostly, superficial, and, they, share, the, same, phonetic, repertoire, and, systemic, features, states, salomon, they, all, have, essentially, the, same, set, of, eleven, to, fourteen, vowels, and, thirty, three, consonants, as, established, by, the, sanskrit, language, and, attestable, in, the, brahmi, script, further, a, closer, examination, reveals, that, they, all, have, the, similar, basic, graphic, principles, the, same, varnamala,

commonly, used, today, is, the, iast, international, alphabet, of, sanskrit, transliteration, which, has, been, the, academic, standard, since, 1888, ascii, based, transliteration, schemes, have, also, evolved, because, of, difficulties, representing, sanskrit, characters, in, computer, systems, these, include, harvard, kyoto, and, itrans, a, transliteration, scheme, that, is, used, widely, on, the, internet, especially, in, usenet, and, in, email, for, considerations, of, speed, of, entry, as, well, as, rendering, issues, with, the, wide, availability, of, unicode, aware, web, browsers,

support, european, scholars, in, the, 19th, century, generally, preferred, devanagari, for, the, transcription, and, reproduction, of, whole, texts, and, lengthy, excerpts, however, references, to, individual, words, and, names, in, texts, composed, in, european, languages, were, usually, represented, with, roman, transliteration, from, the, 20th, century, onwards, because, of, production,

and, southeast, asia, with, significant, discoveries, in, nepal, vietnam, and, cambodia, literature, in, sanskrit, can, be, broadly, divided, into, texts, composed, in, vedic, sanskrit, and, the, later, classical, sanskrit, vedic, sanskrit, is, the, language, of, the, extensive, liturgical, works, of, the, vedic, religion, which, aside, from, the, four, vedas, include, the, br, hma, as, and, the, s, tras, the, vedic, literature, that, survives, is, entirely, of, a, religious, form, whereas, works, in, classical, sanskrit, exist, in, a, wide, variety, of, fields, including, epics, lyric, drama, romance, fairytale, fables, grammar, civil, and, religious, law, the, science, of, politics, and, practical, life, the, science, of, love, and, sex, philosophy, medicine, astronomy, astrology, and, mathematics, and, is, largely, secular, in, subject, matter, while, vedic, literature, is, essentially, optimistic, in, spirit, portraying, man, as, strong, and, powerful, capable, of, finding, fulfilment, both, here, and, in, the, afterworld, the, later, literature, is, pessimistic, portraying, humans, as, controlled, by, the, forces, of, fate, with, worldly, pleasures, deemed, the, cause, of, misery, these, fundamental, differences, in, psychology, are, attributed, to, the, absence, of, the, doctrines, of, karma, and, reincarnation, in, the, vedic, period, notions, which, are, very, prevalent, in, later, times, sanskrit, has, been, written, in, various, scripts, on, a, variety, of, media, such, as, palm, leaves, cloth, paper, rock, and, metal, sheets, from, ancient, times, as, an, indo, european, language, sanskrit, s, core, lexicon, is, inherited, from, proto, indo, european, over, time, however, the, language, exhibits, a, tendency, to, shed, many, of, these, inherited, words, and, borrow, others, in, their, place, from, other, sources, in, the, oldest, vedic, literature, there, are, few, such, non, indo, european, words, but, these, progressively, grow, in, volume, the, following, are, some, of, the, old, indo, european, words, that, eventually, fade, out, of, use, in, sanskrit, the, sources, of, these, new, loanwords, are, many, and, vary, across, the, different, regions, of, the, indian, subcontinent, but, of, all, influences, on, the, lexicon, of, sanskrit, the, most, important, is, dravidian, the, following, is, a, list, of, dravidian, entrants, into, sanskrit, lexicon, although, some, may, have, been, contested, while, vedic, and, epic, form, of, speech, is, largely, cognate, to, that, of, other, indo, european, languages, such, as, greek, and, latin, later, sanskrit, shows, a, tendency, to, move, away, from, using, verbal, forms, to, nominal, ones, examples, of, nominal, forms, taking, the, place, of, conventional, conjugation, are, however, the, most, notable, development, is, the, prolific, use, of, word, compounding, to, express, ideas, normally, conveyed, by, verbal, forms, and, subclauses, introduced, by, conjunctions, classical, sanskrit, s, pre, eminent, playwright, k, lid, sa, uses, for, nearly, 2, 000, years, sanskrit, was, the, language, of, a, cultural, order, that, exerted, influence, across, south, asia, inner, asia, southeast, asia, and, to, a, certain, extent, east, asia, a, significant, form, of, post, vedic, sanskrit, is, found, in, the, sanskrit, of, indian, epic, poetry, the, ramayana, and, mahabharata, the, deviations, from, p, ini, in, the, epics, are, generally, considered, to, be, on, account, of, interference, from, prakrits, or, innovations, and, not, because, they, are, pre,

languages, based, on, early, buddhist, prakrit, texts, which, subsequently, assimilated, to, the, classical, sanskrit, standard, in, varying, degrees, sanskrit, has, greatly, influenced, the, languages, of, india, that, grew, from, its, vocabulary, and, grammatical, base, for, instance, hindi, is, a, sanskritised, register, of, hindustani, all, modern, indo, aryan, languages, as, well, as, munda, and, dravidian, languages, have, borrowed, many, words, either, directly, from, sanskrit, tatsama, words, or, indirectly, via, middle, indo, aryan, languages, tadbhava, words, words, originating, in, sanskrit, are, estimated, at, roughly, fifty, percent, of, the, vocabulary, of, modern, indo, aryan, languages, as, well, as, the, literary, forms, of, malayalam, and, kannada, literary, texts, in, telugu, are, lexically, sanskrit, or, sanskritised, to, an, enormous, extent, perhaps, seventy, percent, or, more, marathi, is, another, prominent, language, in, western, india,

about, two, millennia, which, has, helped, sanskrit, influence, on, all, the, indic, languages, emeneau, and, burrow, mention, the, tendency, for, all, four, of, the, dravidian, literary, languages, in, south, to, make, literary, use, of, total, sanskrit, lexicon, indiscriminately, there, are, a, large, number, of, loanwords, found, in, the, vocabulary, of, the, three, major, dravidian, languages, malayalam, kannada, and, telugu, tamil, also, has, significant, loanwords, from, sanskrit, krishnamurthi, mentions, that, although, it, is, not, clear, when, the, sanskrit, influence, happened, on, the, dravidian, languages, it, might, have, been, around, the, 5th, century, bce, at, the, time, of, separation, of, tamil, and, kannada, from, a, common, ancestral, stage, the, borrowed, words, are, classified, into, two, types, based, on, phonological, integration, tadbhava, those, words, derived, from, prakrit, and, tatsama, unassimilated, loanwords, from, sanskrit,

sanskrit, word, can, be, used, in, malayalam, by, integrating, prosodic, phonological, changes, as, per, grant, loanwords, have, been, integrated, into, malayalam, by, prosodic, phonological, changes, as, per, grant, these, phonological, changes, are, either, by, replacement, of, a, vowel, as, in, sant, am, coming, from, sanskrit, santa, s, gar, am, from, s, gara, or, addition, of, prothetic, vowel, as, in, aracan, from, r, j, uruvam, from, r, pa, codyam, from, sodhya, hans, henrich, et, al, note, that, the, language, of, the, pre, modern, telugu, literature, was, also, highly, influenced, by, sanskrit, and, was, standardized, between, 11th, and, 14th, centuries, aiyar, has, shown, that, in, a, class, of, tadbhavas, in, telugu, the, first, and, second, letters, are, often, replaced, by,

more, sanskrit, in, tamil, than, in, the, sanskrit, derived, north, indian, vernaculars, sanskrit, words, have, been, tamilized, through, the, tamil, phonematic, grid, sanskrit, was, a, language, for, religious, purposes, and, for, the, political, elite, in, parts, of, medieval, era, southeast, asia, central, asia, and, east, asia, having, been, introduced, in, these, regions, mainly, along, with, the, spread, of, buddhism, in, some, cases, it, has, competed, with, p, li, for, prominence, buddhist, sanskrit, has, had, a, considerable, influence, on, sino, tibetan, languages, such, as, chinese, state, william, wang, and, chaofen, sun, many, words, have, been, adopted, from, sanskrit, into, the, chinese, both, in, its, historic, religious, discourse, and, everyday, use, this, process, likely, started, about, 200, ce, and, continued, through, about, 1400, ce, with, the, efforts, of, monks, such, as, yuezhi, anxi, kangju, tianzhu, yan, fodiao, faxian, xuanzang, and, yijing, further, as, the, chinese, languages, and, culture, influenced, the, rest, of, east, asia, the, ideas, in, sanskrit, texts, and, some, of, its, linguistic, elements, migrated, further, many, terms, were, transliterated, directly, and, added, to, the, chinese, vocabulary, chinese, words, like, ch, n, devanagari, k, a, a, instantaneous, period, were, borrowed, from, sanskrit, many, sanskrit, texts, survive, only, in, tibetan, collections, of, commentaries, to, the, buddhist, teachings, the, tengyur, sanskrit, has, also, influenced, the, religious, register, of, japanese, mostly, through, transliterations, these, were, borrowed, from, chinese, transliterations, in, particular, the, shingon, lit, true, words, sect, of, esoteric, buddhism, has, been, relying, on, sanskrit, and, original, sanskrit, mantras, and, writings, as, a, means, of, realizing, buddhahood, a, large, number, of, inscriptions, in, sanskrit, across, southeast, asia, testify, the, influence, the, language, held, in, these, regions, languages, such, as, indonesian, thai, and, lao, contain, many, loanwords, from, sanskrit, as, does, khmer, many, sanskrit, loanwords, are, also, found, in, austronesian, languages, such, as, javanese, particularly, the, older, form, in, which, nearly, half, the, vocabulary, is, borrowed, other, austronesian, languages, such, as, malay, descended, into, modern, malaysian, and, indonesian, standards, also, derive, much, of, their, vocabulary, from, sanskrit, similarly, philippine, languages, such, as, tagalog, have, some, sanskrit, loanwords, although, more, are, derived, from, spanish, a, sanskrit, loanword, encountered, in, many, southeast, asian, languages, is, the, word, bh, or, spoken, language, which, is, used, to, refer, to, the, names, of, many, languages, to, this, day, southeast, asian, languages, such, as, thai, are, known, to, draw, upon, sanskrit, for, technical, vocabulary, the, earliest, sanskrit, text, which, was, founded, in, the, indonesian, archipelago, was, at, eastern, borneo, dating, back, to, 400, ce, known, as, the, mulavarman, inscription, this, is, one, of, the, reason, of, strong, influence, of, indian, culture, that, entered, the, malay, archipelago, during, the, indianization, era, and, since, then, indian, culture, has, been, absorbed, towards, indonesian, culture, and, language, thus, the, sanskrit, culture, in, indonesia, exists, not, as, a, religious, aspect, but, more, towards, a, cultural, aspect, that, has, been, present, for, generations, resulting, in, a, more, cultural, rather, than, hinduistic, value, of, the, indonesian, people, as, a, result, it, is, common, to, find, muslim, or, christian, indonesians, with, names, that, have, indian, or, sanskrit, nuances, unlike, names, derived, from, sanskrit, in, thai, and, khmer, the, pronunciation, of, sanskrit, names, in, indonesia, is, more, similar, to, the, original, indian, pronunciation, except, that, v, is, changed, to, w, for, example, vishnu, in, india, will, be, spelled, wisnu, in, indonesia, sanskrit, has, influenced, indonesian, to, a, great, extent, many, words, in, indonesian, are, taken, from, sanskrit, for, example, from, the, word, language, bh, a, itself, comes, from, sanskrit, which, means, talking, accent, in, fact, names, of, cities, such, as, jayapura, the, capital, city, of, papua, province, including, terms, and, mottoes, of, government, educational, and, military, institutions, use, sanskrit, such, as, the, rank, of, general, for, example, in, the, indonesian, navy, is, laksamana, taken, from, the, ramayana, the, name, of, the, environmental, award, given, to, cities, throughout, indonesia, by, the, central, government, is, also, taken, from, sanskrit, known, as, the, adipura, award, namely, from, the, words, adi, which, means, role, model, and, pura, which, means, city, literally, a, role, model, city, or, a, city, worthy, of, being, an, example, sanskrit, terms, are, also, widely, used, in, numerous, government, institutions, such, as, the, armed, forces, and, national, police, for, example, the, motto, of, the, indonesian, national, police, which, reads, rashtra, sevakottama, the, motto, of, the, indonesian, military, academy, which, reads, adhitakarya, mahatvavirya, nagarabhakti, and, the, motto, of, the, indonesian, naval, academy, which, reads, hree, dharma, shanti, are, one, of, the, small, examples, other, sanskrit, terms, such, as, adhi, makayasa, chandradimuka, tri, dharma, eka, karma, taruna, etc, are, also, used, intensively, in, the, indonesian, security, and, defence, forces, in, ancient, and, medieval, times, several, sanskrit, words, in, the, field, of, food, and, spices, made, their, way, into, european, languages, including, greek, latin, and, later, english, some, of, these, are, pepper, ginger, and, sugar, english, today, has, several, words, of, sanskrit, origin, most, of, them, borrowed, during, the, british, raj, or, later, some, of, these,
