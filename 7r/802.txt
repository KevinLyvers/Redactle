disorders, in, comparison, with, other, workers, the, risk, for, social, workers, is, high, even, when, comparing, to, other, similar, human, service, professions, and, social, workers, in, psychiatric, care, or, in, assistance, analysis, are, the, most, vulnerable, there, are, multiple, explanations, for, this, increased, risk, individual, components, include, secondary, traumatic,

an, organization, that, is, focused, on, revenue, maximization, and, by, principle, it, is, only, responsible, and, answerable, to, its, board, members, the, objective, of, a, social, work, license, is, to, ensure, the, public, s, safety, and, quality, of, service, it, is, intended, to, ensure, that, social, workers, understand, and, can, follow, nasw, s, code, of, ethics, in, their, occupational, practices, ascertain, social, workers, knowledge, in, service, provision, and, protect, the, use, of, the, social, work, title, from, misuse, and, unethical, practices, however, a, study, found, out, that, having, a, social, work, license, is, not, related, to, improved, service, quality, for, consumers, they, substituted, paraprofessionals, with, qualified, licensed, social, workers, and, found, out, that, there, was, no, improvement, in, overall, facility, quality, quality, of, life, or, the, provision, of, social, services, the, paraprofessionals, with, training, were, able, to, perform, similarly, to, licensed, social, workers, just, like, any, trained, human, resource, in, a, workforce, would, perform, a, job, for, which, they, are, trained, social, work, graduates, gain, this, knowledge, and, training, through, academic, and, financial, investment, in, earning, an, accredited, social, work, degree, degree, equalization, process, and, from, receiving, professional, supervision, during, and, post, graduation, for, decades, the, social, work, community, has, called, on, aswb, for, transparency, regarding, the, data, on, the, validity, and, racial, sensitivity, of, the, exams, however, aswb, suppressed, this, information, leading, many, critics, to, assess, that, if, the, exams, were, free, from, flaws, and, bias, such, data, would, have, been, released, a, long, time, ago, in, 2022, aswb, released, the, pass, rate, data, and, a, change, org, petition, called, stopaswb, highlighted, with, academic, citations, that, the, association, of, social, work, boards, exams, are, biased, with, feedback, from, white, social, workers, the, petition, also, pointed, out, that, the, exams, unfairly, penalize, social, workers, who, practice, in, other, languages, require, privileged, resources, for, success, and, utilize, oppressive, standards, in, formatting, the, exams, which, are, inconsistent, with, social, work, values, the, national, association, of, social, workers, nasw, expressed, opposition, to, the, social, work, licensing, exams, conducted, by, the, association, of, social, work, boards, aswb, this, came, after, analyzing, aswb, data, which, revealed, considerable, discrepancies, in, pass, rates, for, aspiring, social, workers, of, diverse, racial, backgrounds, older, individuals, and, those, who, speak, english, as, a, second, language, esl, pass, rates, of, exams, indicate, that, white, test, takers, are, more, than, twice, as, likely, to, pass, on, their, first, attempt, compared, to, bipoc, test, takers, indicating, high, construct, irrelevant, variance, among, other, issues, this, finding, raises, questions, about, the, reliability, and, credibility, of, social, work, licensure, process, through, aswb, exams, nasw, s, firm, stance, on, the, matter, serves, as, a, significant, reckoning, moment, regarding, the, systemic, racism, in, the, social, work, profession, particularly, within, its, regulatory, system, it, also, highlights, aswb, s, silence, about, the, licensure, apparatus, that, perpetuates, racial, disparities, leading, its, association, members, to, institutional, betrayal, after, the, release, of, aswb, data, showing, race, and, age, related, discrepancies, in, pass, rates, the, national, accreditation, body, the, council, on, social, work, education, cswe, removed, the, aswb, licensure, exam, pass, rates, as, an, option, for, social, work, education, programs, to, meet, accreditation, requirements, members, from, various, communities, in, social, work, have, expressed, that, discussions, about, addressing, this, systemic, oppression, should, be, guided, by, a, formal, acknowledgment, of, wrongdoing, and, a, spirit, of, reconciliation, and, healing, the, state, of, illinois, passed, a, landmark, bill, hb2365, sa1, marking, a, significant, step, in, reducing, its, regulatory, body, s, dependency, on, aswb, with, this, bill, illinois, has, addressed, the, uneven, power, that, aswb, held, and, its, unfettered, pursuit, of, profit, which, affected, the, qualification, of, educated, social, workers, for, practice, entry, now, educated, social, workers, can, obtain, licensing, by, completing, 3000, hours, of, professional, supervision, eliminating, the, previous, requirement, of, aswb, exam, results, for, licensure, which, often, led, to, issues, of, unemployment, and, related, emotional, behavioral, and, physical, health, consequences, since, the, early, 1990s, researchers, have, critiqued, aswb, exams, for, their, lack, of, content, and, criterion, validity, that, undermines, the, test, validity, all, together, in, a, study, conducted, in, 2023, it, was, discovered, that, there, are, questions, in, aswb, exams, that, have, rationales, based, on, theories, that, are, not, evidence, based, and, that, have, significant, item, validity, issues, the, researchers, used, generative, ai, application, chatgpt, to, test, aswb, rationales, and, found, that, the, rationales, provided, by, chatgpt, were, of, higher, quality, they, revealed, that, chatgpt, exhibited, an, excellent, ability, to, recognize, social, work, related, text, patterns, for, scenario, based, decision, making, and, offered, high, quality, rationales, while, taking, into, account, the, safety, and, ethics, in, social, work, practice, even, without, specific, training, for, such, a, task, they, suggested, that, it, may, be, necessary, and, timely, to, move, away, from, oppressive, assessment, formats, used, to, evaluate, social, workers, competence, and, reconsider, licensing, exams, with, serious, validity, issues, that, disproportionately, exclude, individuals, based, on, their, race, age, and, language, a, proposed, assessment, format, is, one, based, on, mastery, learning, which, would, lead, to, competency, based, licensing, due, to, the, accumulated, evidence, of, significant, validity, flaws, in, aswb, s, tests, its, conflict, of, interest, and, other, issues, many, researchers, have, urged, state, legislators, and, regulators, to, discontinue, the, use, of, aswb, exams, for, licensure, or, temporarily, suspend, them, until, a, novel, anti, oppressive, and, validated, alternative, is, established, in, the, interim, they, suggest, relying, on, traditional, supervision, methods, to, ensure, the, safe, and, ethical, practice, of, social, work, they, elucidate, that, supervision, not, only, guides, licensure, seekers, but, also, allows, well, equipped, supervisors, to, assess, individuals, capabilities, to, practice, safely, and, ethically, more, accurately, in, contexts, which, is, a, more, valid, approach, to, assessing, such, competence, social, workers, have, several, professional, associations, that, provide, ethical, guidance, and, other, forms, of, support, for, their, members, and, social, work, in, general, these, associations, may, be, international, continental, semi, continental,
