in, grammar, tense, is, a, category, that, expresses, time, reference, tenses, are, usually, manifested, by, the, use, of, specific, forms, of, verbs, particularly, in, their, conjugation, patterns, the, main, tenses, found, in, many, languages, include, the, past, present, and, future, some, languages, have, only, two, distinct, tenses, such, as, past, and, nonpast, or, future, and, nonfuture, there, are, also, tenseless, languages, like, most, of, the, chinese, languages, though, they, can, possess, a, future, and, nonfuture, system, typical, of, sino, tibetan, languages, in, recent, work, maria, bittner, and, judith, tonhauser, have, described, the, different, ways, in, which, tenseless, languages, nonetheless, mark, time, on, the, other, hand, some, languages, make, finer, tense, distinctions, such, as, remote, vs, recent, past, or, near, vs, remote, future, tenses, generally, express, time, relative, to, the, moment, of, speaking, in, some, contexts, however, their, meaning, may, be, relativized, to, a, point, in, the, past, or, future, which, is, established, in, the, discourse, the, moment, being, spoken, about, this, is, called, relative, as, opposed, to, absolute, tense, some, languages, have, different, verb, forms, or, constructions, which, manifest, relative, tense, such, as, pluperfect, past, in, the, past, and, future, in, the, past, expressions, of, tense, are, often, closely, connected, with, expressions, of, the, category, of, aspect, sometimes, what, are, traditionally, called, tenses, in, languages, such, as, latin, may, in, modern, analysis, be, regarded, as, combinations, of, tense, with, aspect, verbs, are, also, often, conjugated, for, mood, and, since, in, many, cases, the, three, categories, are, not, manifested, separately, some, languages, may, be, described, in, terms, of, a, combined, tense, aspect, mood, tam, system, the, english, noun, tense, comes, from, old, french, tens, time, spelled, temps, in, modern, french, through, deliberate, archaization, from, latin, tempus, time, it, is, not, related, to, the, adjective, tense, which, comes, from, latin, tensus, the, perfect, passive, participle, of, tendere, stretch, in, modern, linguistic, theory, tense, is, understood, as, a, category, that, expresses, grammaticalizes, time, reference, namely, one, which, using, grammatical, means, places, a, state, or, action, in, time, nonetheless, in, many, descriptions, of, languages, particularly, in, traditional, european, grammar, the, term, tense, is, applied, to, verb, forms, or, constructions, that, express, not, merely, position, in, time, but, also, additional, properties, of, the, state, or, action, particularly, aspectual, or, modal, properties, the, category, of, aspect, expresses, how, a, state, or, action, relates, to, time, whether, it, is, seen, as, a, complete, event, an, ongoing, or, repeated, situation, etc, many, languages, make, a, distinction, between, perfective, aspect, denoting, complete, events, and, imperfective, aspect, denoting, ongoing, or, repeated, situations, some, also, have, other, aspects, such, as, a, perfect, aspect, denoting, a, state, following, a, prior, event, some, of, the, traditional, tenses, express, time, reference, together, with, aspectual, information, in, latin, and, french, for, example, the, imperfect, denotes, past, time, in, combination, with, imperfective, aspect, while, other, verb, forms, the, latin, perfect, and, the, french, pass, compos, or, pass, simple, are, used, for, past, time, reference, with, perfective, aspect, the, category, of, mood, is, used, to, express, modality, which, includes, such, properties, as, uncertainty, evidentiality, and, obligation, commonly, encountered, moods, include, the, indicative, subjunctive, and, conditional, mood, can, be, bound, up, with, tense, aspect, or, both, in, particular, verb, forms, hence, certain, languages, are, sometimes, analysed, as, having, a, single, tense, aspect, mood, tam, system, without, separate, manifestation, of, the, three, categories, the, term, tense, then, particularly, in, less, formal, contexts, is, sometimes, used, to, denote, any, combination, of, tense, proper, aspect, and, mood, as, regards, english, there, are, many, verb, forms, and, constructions, which, combine, time, reference, with, continuous, and, or, perfect, aspect, and, with, indicative, subjunctive, or, conditional, mood, particularly, in, some, english, language, teaching, materials, some, or, all, of, these, forms, can, be, referred, to, simply, as, tenses, see, below, particular, tense, forms, need, not, always, carry, their, basic, time, referential, meaning, in, every, case, for, instance, the, historical, present, is, a, use, of, the, present, tense, to, refer, to, past, events, the, phenomenon, of, fake, tense, is, common, crosslinguistically, as, a, means, of, marking, counterfactuality, in, conditionals, and, wishes, not, all, languages, have, tense, tenseless, languages, include, chinese, and, dyirbal, 50, 53, some, languages, have, all, three, basic, tenses, the, past, present, and, future, while, others, have, only, two, some, have, past, and, nonpast, tenses, the, latter, covering, both, present, and, future, times, as, in, arabic, japanese, and, in, some, analyses, english, whereas, others, such, as, greenlandic, quechua, and, nivkh, have, future, and, nonfuture, some, languages, have, four, or, more, tenses, making, finer, distinctions, either, in, the, past, e, g, remote, vs, recent, past, or, in, the, future, e, g, near, vs, remote, future, the, six, tense, language, kalaw, lagaw, ya, of, australia, has, the, remote, past, the, recent, past, the, today, past, the, present, the, today, near, future, and, the, remote, future, some, languages, like, the, amazonian, cubeo, language, have, a, historical, past, tense, used, for, events, perceived, as, historical, tenses, that, refer, specifically, to, today, are, called, hodiernal, tenses, these, can, be, either, past, or, future, apart, from, kalaw, lagaw, ya, another, language, which, features, such, tenses, is, mwera, a, bantu, language, of, tanzania, it, is, also, suggested, that, in, 17th, century, french, the, pass, compos, served, as, a, hodiernal, past, tenses, that, contrast, with, hodiernals, by, referring, to, the, past, before, today, or, the, future, after, today, are, called, pre, hodiernal, and, post, hodiernal, respectively, some, languages, also, have, a, crastinal, tense, a, future, tense, referring, specifically, to, tomorrow, found, in, some, bantu, languages, or, a, hesternal, tense, a, past, tense, referring, specifically, to, yesterday, although, this, name, is, also, sometimes, used, to, mean, pre, hodiernal, a, tense, for, after, tomorrow, is, thus, called, post, crastinal, and, one, for, before, yesterday, is, called, pre, hesternal, another, tense, found, in, some, languages, including, luganda, is, the, persistive, tense, used, to, indicate, that, a, state, or, ongoing, action, is, still, the, case, or, in, the, negative, is, no, longer, the, case, luganda, also, has, tenses, meaning, so, far, and, not, yet, some, languages, have, special, tense, forms, that, are, used, to, express, relative, tense, tenses, that, refer, to, the, past, relative, to, the, time, under, consideration, are, called, anterior, these, include, the, pluperfect, for, the, past, relative, to, a, past, time, and, the, future, perfect, for, the, past, relative, to, a, future, time, similarly, posterior, tenses, refer, to, the, future, relative, to, the, time, under, consideration, as, with, the, english, future, in, the, past, he, said, that, he, would, go, relative, tense, forms, are, also, sometimes, analysed, as, combinations, of, tense, with, aspect, the, perfect, aspect, in, the, anterior, case, or, the, prospective, aspect, in, the, posterior, case, some, languages, such, as, nez, perce, or, cavine, a, also, have, periodic, tense, markers, that, encode, that, the, action, occurs, in, a, recurrent, temporal, period, of, the, day, in, the, morning, during, the, day, at, night, until, dawn, etc, or, of, the, year, in, winter, some, languages, have, cyclic, tense, systems, this, is, a, form, of, temporal, marking, where, tense, is, given, relative, to, a, reference, point, or, reference, span, in, burarra, for, example, events, that, occurred, earlier, on, the, day, of, speaking, are, marked, with, the, same, verb, forms, as, events, that, happened, in, the, far, past, while, events, that, happened, yesterday, compared, to, the, moment, of, speech, are, marked, with, the, same, forms, as, events, in, the, present, this, can, be, thought, of, as, a, system, where, events, are, marked, as, prior, or, contemporaneous, to, points, of, reference, on, a, timeline, tense, is, normally, indicated, by, the, use, of, a, particular, verb, form, either, an, inflected, form, of, the, main, verb, or, a, multi, word, construction, or, both, in, combination, inflection, may, involve, the, use, of, affixes, such, as, the, ed, ending, that, marks, the, past, tense, of, english, regular, verbs, but, can, also, entail, stem, modifications, such, as, ablaut, as, found, as, in, the, strong, verbs, in, english, and, other, germanic, languages, or, reduplication, multi, word, tense, constructions, often, involve, auxiliary, verbs, or, clitics, examples, which, combine, both, types, of, tense, marking, include, the, french, pass, compos, which, has, an, auxiliary, verb, together, with, the, inflected, past, participle, form, of, the, main, verb, and, the, irish, past, tense, where, the, proclitic, do, in, various, surface, forms, appears, in, conjunction, with, the, affixed, or, ablaut, modified, past, tense, form, of, the, main, verb, as, has, already, been, mentioned, indications, of, tense, are, often, bound, up, with, indications, of, other, verbal, categories, such, as, aspect, and, mood, the, conjugation, patterns, of, verbs, often, also, reflect, agreement, with, categories, pertaining, to, the, subject, such, as, person, number, and, gender, it, is, consequently, not, always, possible, to, identify, elements, that, mark, any, specific, category, such, as, tense, separately, from, the, others, languages, that, do, not, have, grammatical, tense, such, as, most, sinitic, languages, express, time, reference, chiefly, by, lexical, means, through, adverbials, time, phrases, and, so, on, the, same, is, done, in, tensed, languages, to, supplement, or, reinforce, the, time, information, conveyed, by, the, choice, of, tense, time, information, is, also, sometimes, conveyed, as, a, secondary, feature, by, markers, of, other, categories, as, with, the, aspect, markers, le, and, gu, which, in, most, cases, place, an, action, in, past, time, however, much, time, information, is, conveyed, implicitly, by, context, it, is, therefore, not, always, necessary, when, translating, from, a, tensed, to, a, tenseless, language, say, to, express, explicitly, in, the, target, language, all, of, the, information, conveyed, by, the, tenses, in, the, source, a, few, languages, have, been, shown, to, mark, tense, information, as, well, as, aspect, and, mood, on, nouns, this, may, be, called, nominal, tense, or, more, broadly, nominal, tam, which, includes, nominal, marking, of, aspect, and, mood, as, well, the, syntactic, properties, of, tense, have, figured, prominently, in, formal, analyses, of, how, tense, marking, interacts, with, word, order, some, languages, such, as, french, allow, an, adverb, adv, to, intervene, between, a, tense, marked, verb, v, and, its, direct, object, o, in, other, words, they, permit, ordering, in, contrast, other, languages, such, as, english, do, not, allow, the, adverb, to, intervene, between, the, verb, and, its, direct, object, and, require, ordering, tense, in, syntax, is, represented, by, the, category, label, t, which, is, the, head, of, a, tp, tense, phrase, in, linguistics, a, tenseless, language, is, a, language, that, does, not, have, a, grammatical, category, of, tense, tenseless, languages, can, and, do, refer, to, time, but, they, do, so, using, lexical, items, such, as, adverbs, or, verbs, or, by, using, combinations, of, aspect, mood, and, words, that, establish, time, reference, examples, of, tenseless, languages, are, burmese, dyirbal, 50, 53, most, varieties, of, chinese, malay, including, indonesian, thai, maya, linguistic, nomenclature, yukatek, maya, vietnamese, and, in, some, analyses, greenlandic, kalaallisut, and, guaran, the, study, of, modern, languages, has, been, greatly, influenced, by, the, grammar, of, the, classical, languages, since, early, grammarians, often, monks, had, no, other, reference, point, to, describe, their, language, latin, terminology, is, often, used, to, describe, modern, languages, sometimes, with, a, change, of, meaning, as, with, the, application, of, perfect, to, forms, in, english, that, do, not, necessarily, have, perfective, meaning, or, the, words, imperfekt, and, perfekt, to, german, past, tense, forms, that, mostly, lack, any, relationship, to, the, aspects, implied, by, those, terms, latin, is, traditionally, described, as, having, six, verb, paradigms, for, tense, the, latin, for, tense, being, tempus, plural, tempora, imperfect, tense, verbs, represent, a, past, process, combined, with, so, called, imperfective, aspect, that, is, they, often, stand, for, an, ongoing, past, action, or, state, at, a, past, point, in, time, see, secondary, present, or, represent, habitual, actions, see, latin, tenses, with, modality, e, g, he, was, eating, he, used, to, eat, the, perfect, tense, combines, the, meanings, of, a, simple, past, he, ate, with, that, of, an, english, perfect, tense, he, has, eaten, which, in, ancient, greek, are, two, different, tenses, aorist, and, perfect, the, pluperfect, the, perfect, and, the, future, perfect, may, also, realise, relative, tenses, standing, for, events, that, are, past, at, the, time, of, another, event, see, secondary, past, for, instance, mortuus, erat, mortuus, est, mortuus, erit, may, stand, for, respectively, he, had, died, he, has, died, and, he, will, have, died, latin, verbs, are, inflected, for, tense, and, aspect, together, with, mood, indicative, subjunctive, infinitive, and, imperative, and, voice, active, or, passive, most, verbs, can, be, built, by, selecting, a, verb, stem, and, adapting, them, to, endings, endings, may, vary, according, to, the, speech, role, the, number, and, the, gender, of, the, subject, or, an, object, sometimes, verb, groups, function, as, a, unit, and, supplement, inflection, for, tense, see, latin, periphrases, for, details, on, verb, structure, see, latin, tenses, and, latin, conjugation, the, paradigms, for, tenses, in, ancient, greek, are, similar, to, the, ones, in, latin, but, with, a, three, way, aspect, contrast, in, the, past, the, aorist, the, perfect, and, the, imperfect, both, aorist, and, imperfect, verbs, can, represent, a, past, event, through, contrast, the, imperfect, verb, often, implies, a, longer, duration, e, g, they, urged, him, vs, they, persuaded, him, the, aorist, participle, represents, the, first, event, of, a, two, event, sequence, and, the, present, participle, represents, an, ongoing, event, at, the, time, of, another, event, perfect, verbs, stood, for, past, actions, if, the, result, is, still, present, e, g, i, have, found, it, or, for, present, states, resulting, from, a, past, event, e, g, i, remember, english, has, only, two, morphological, tenses, the, present, or, non, past, as, in, he, goes, and, the, past, or, preterite, as, in, he, went, the, non, past, usually, references, the, present, but, sometimes, references, the, future, as, in, the, bus, leaves, tomorrow, in, special, uses, such, as, the, historical, present, it, can, talk, about, the, past, as, well, these, morphological, tenses, are, marked, either, with, a, suffix, walk, s, walked, or, with, ablaut, sing, s, sang, in, some, contexts, particularly, in, english, language, teaching, various, tense, aspect, combinations, are, referred, to, loosely, as, tenses, similarly, the, term, future, tense, is, sometimes, loosely, applied, to, cases, where, modals, such, as, will, are, used, to, talk, about, future, points, in, time, proto, indo, european, verbs, had, present, perfect, stative, imperfect, and, aorist, forms, these, can, be, considered, as, representing, two, tenses, present, and, past, with, different, aspects, most, languages, in, the, indo, european, family, have, developed, systems, either, with, two, morphological, tenses, present, or, non, past, and, past, or, with, three, present, past, and, future, the, tenses, often, form, part, of, entangled, tense, aspect, mood, conjugation, systems, additional, tenses, tense, aspect, combinations, etc, can, be, provided, by, compound, constructions, containing, auxiliary, verbs, the, germanic, languages, which, include, english, have, present, non, past, and, past, tenses, formed, morphologically, with, future, and, other, additional, forms, made, using, auxiliaries, in, standard, german, the, compound, past, perfekt, has, replaced, the, simple, morphological, past, in, most, contexts, the, romance, languages, descendants, of, latin, have, past, present, and, future, morphological, tenses, with, additional, aspectual, distinction, in, the, past, french, is, an, example, of, a, language, where, as, in, german, the, simple, morphological, perfective, past, pass, simple, has, mostly, given, way, to, a, compound, form, pass, compos, irish, a, celtic, language, has, past, present, and, future, tenses, see, irish, conjugation, the, past, contrasts, perfective, and, imperfective, aspect, and, some, verbs, retain, such, a, contrast, in, the, present, classical, irish, had, a, three, way, aspectual, contrast, of, simple, perfective, imperfective, in, the, past, and, present, tenses, modern, scottish, gaelic, on, the, other, hand, only, has, past, non, past, and, indefinite, and, in, the, case, of, the, verb, be, including, its, use, as, an, auxiliary, also, present, tense, persian, an, indo, iranian, language, has, past, and, non, past, forms, with, additional, aspectual, distinctions, future, can, be, expressed, using, an, auxiliary, but, almost, never, in, non, formal, context, colloquially, the, perfect, suffix, e, can, be, added, to, past, tenses, to, indicate, that, an, action, is, speculative, or, reported, e, g, it, seems, that, he, was, doing, they, say, that, he, was, doing, a, similar, feature, is, found, in, turkish, for, details, see, persian, verbs, hindustani, hindi, and, urdu, an, indo, aryan, language, has, indicative, perfect, past, and, indicative, future, forms, while, the, indicative, present, and, indicative, imperfect, past, conjugations, exist, only, for, the, verb, hon, to, be, the, indicative, future, is, constructed, using, the, future, subjunctive, conjugations, which, used, to, be, the, indicative, present, conjugations, in, older, forms, of, hind, urdu, by, adding, a, future, future, suffix, g, that, declines, for, gender, and, the, number, of, the, noun, that, the, pronoun, refes, to, the, forms, of, g, are, derived, from, the, perfective, participle, forms, of, the, verb, to, go, j, na, the, conjugations, of, the, indicative, perfect, past, and, the, indicative, imperfect, past, are, derived, from, participles, just, like, the, past, tense, formation, in, slavic, languages, and, hence, they, agree, with, the, grammatical, number, and, the, gender, of, noun, which, the, pronoun, refers, to, and, not, the, pronoun, itself, the, perfect, past, doubles, as, the, perfective, aspect, participle, and, the, imperfect, past, conjugations, act, as, the, copula, to, mark, imperfect, past, when, used, with, the, aspectual, participles, hindi, urdu, has, an, overtly, marked, tense, aspect, mood, system, periphrastic, hindi, urdu, verb, forms, aspectual, verb, forms, consist, of, two, elements, the, first, of, these, two, elements, is, the, aspect, marker, and, the, second, element, the, copula, is, the, common, tense, mood, marker, hindi, urdu, has, 3, grammatical, aspects, habitual, perfective, and, progressive, and, 5, grammatical, moods, indicative, presumptive, subjunctive, contrafactual, and, imperative, see, hindi, verbs, in, the, slavic, languages, verbs, are, intrinsically, perfective, or, imperfective, in, russian, and, some, other, languages, in, the, group, perfective, verbs, have, past, and, future, tenses, while, imperfective, verbs, have, past, present, and, future, the, imperfective, future, being, a, compound, tense, in, most, cases, the, future, tense, of, perfective, verbs, is, formed, in, the, same, way, as, the, present, tense, of, imperfective, verbs, however, in, south, slavic, languages, there, may, be, a, greater, variety, of, forms, bulgarian, for, example, has, present, past, both, imperfect, and, aorist, and, future, tenses, for, both, perfective, and, imperfective, verbs, as, well, as, perfect, forms, made, with, an, auxiliary, see, bulgarian, verbs, however, it, doesn, t, have, real, future, tense, because, the, future, tense, is, formed, by, the, shortened, version, of, the, present, of, the, verb, hteti, and, it, just, adds, present, tense, forms, of, person, suffixes, m, i, you, he, she, it, me, we, te, you, plural, t, they, finnish, and, hungarian, both, members, of, the, uralic, language, family, have, morphological, present, non, past, and, past, tenses, the, hungarian, verb, van, to, be, also, has, a, future, form, turkish, verbs, conjugate, for, past, present, and, future, with, a, variety, of, aspects, and, moods, arabic, verbs, have, past, and, non, past, future, can, be, indicated, by, a, prefix, korean, verbs, have, a, variety, of, affixed, forms, which, can, be, described, as, representing, present, past, and, future, tenses, although, they, can, alternatively, be, considered, to, be, aspectual, similarly, japanese, verbs, are, described, as, having, present, and, past, tenses, although, they, may, be, analysed, as, aspects, some, wu, chinese, languages, such, as, shanghainese, use, grammatical, particles, to, mark, some, tenses, other, chinese, languages, and, many, other, east, asian, languages, generally, lack, inflection, and, are, considered, to, be, tenseless, languages, although, they, often, have, aspect, markers, which, convey, certain, information, about, time, reference, for, examples, of, languages, with, a, greater, variety, of, tenses, see, the, section, on, possible, tenses, above, fuller, information, on, tense, formation, and, usage, in, particular, languages,
