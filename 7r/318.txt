a, morpheme, is, the, smallest, meaningful, constituent, of, a, linguistic, expression, the, field, of, linguistic, study, dedicated, to, morphemes, is, called, morphology, in, english, morphemes, are, often, but, not, necessarily, words, morphemes, that, stand, alone, are, considered, roots, such, as, the, morpheme, cat, other, morphemes, called, affixes, are, found, only, in, combination, with, other, morphemes, for, example, the, s, in, cats, indicates, the, concept, of, plurality, but, is, always, bound, to, another, concept, to, indicate, a, specific, kind, of, plurality, this, distinction, is, not, universal, and, does, not, apply, to, for, example, latin, in, which, many, roots, cannot, stand, alone, for, instance, the, latin, root, reg, king, must, always, be, suffixed, with, a, case, marker, rex, reg, s, reg, is, reg, i, etc, for, a, language, like, latin, a, root, can, be, defined, as, the, main, lexical, morpheme, of, a, word, these, sample, english, words, have, the, following, morphological, analyses, every, morpheme, can, be, classified, as, free, or, bound, bound, morphemes, can, be, further, classified, as, derivational, or, inflectional, morphemes, the, main, difference, between, them, is, their, function, in, relation, to, words, allomorphs, are, variants, of, a, morpheme, that, differ, in, form, but, are, semantically, similar, for, example, the, english, plural, marker, has, three, allomorphs, z, bug, s, s, bat, s, or, z, z, bus, es, an, allomorph, is, a, concrete, realization, of, a, morpheme, which, is, an, abstract, unit, that, is, parallel, to, the, relation, of, an, allophone, and, a, phoneme, a, zero, morpheme, is, a, type, of, morpheme, that, carries, semantic, meaning, but, is, not, represented, by, auditory, phoneme, a, word, with, a, zero, morpheme, is, analyzed, as, having, the, morpheme, for, grammatical, purposes, but, the, morpheme, is, not, realized, in, speech, they, are, often, represented, by, within, glosses, generally, such, morphemes, have, no, visible, changes, for, instance, sheep, is, both, the, singular, and, the, plural, form, of, that, noun, rather, than, taking, the, usual, plural, suffix, s, to, form, hypothetical, sheeps, the, plural, is, analyzed, as, being, composed, of, sheep, the, null, plural, suffix, the, intended, meaning, is, thus, derived, from, the, co, occurrence, determiner, in, this, case, some, or, a, in, some, cases, a, zero, morpheme, may, also, be, used, to, contrast, with, other, inflected, forms, of, a, word, that, contain, an, audible, morpheme, for, example, the, plural, noun, cats, in, english, consists, of, the, root, cat, and, the, plural, suffix, s, and, so, the, singular, cat, may, be, analyzed, as, the, root, inflected, with, the, null, singular, suffix, content, morphemes, express, a, concrete, meaning, or, content, and, function, morphemes, have, more, of, a, grammatical, role, for, example, the, morphemes, fast, and, sad, can, be, considered, content, morphemes, on, the, other, hand, the, suffix, ed, is, a, function, morpheme, since, it, has, the, grammatical, function, of, indicating, past, tense, both, categories, may, seem, very, clear, and, intuitive, but, the, idea, behind, them, is, occasionally, more, difficult, to, grasp, since, they, overlap, with, each, other, examples, of, ambiguous, situations, are, the, preposition, over, and, the, determiner, your, which, seem, to, have, concrete, meanings, but, are, considered, function, morphemes, since, their, role, is, to, connect, ideas, grammatically, here, is, a, general, rule, to, determine, the, category, of, a, morpheme, roots, are, composed, of, only, one, morpheme, but, stems, can, be, composed, of, more, than, one, morpheme, any, additional, affixes, are, considered, morphemes, for, example, in, the, word, quirkiness, the, root, is, quirk, but, the, stem, is, quirky, which, has, two, morphemes, moreover, some, pairs, of, affixes, have, identical, phonological, form, but, different, meanings, for, example, the, suffix, er, can, be, either, derivational, e, g, sell, seller, or, inflectional, e, g, small, smaller, such, morphemes, are, called, homophonous, some, words, might, seem, to, be, composed, of, multiple, morphemes, but, are, not, therefore, not, only, form, but, also, meaning, must, be, considered, when, identifying, morphemes, for, example, the, word, madagascar, is, long, and, might, seem, to, have, morphemes, like, mad, gas, and, car, but, it, does, not, conversely, some, short, words, have, multiple, morphemes, e, g, dogs, dog, s, in, natural, language, processing, for, japanese, chinese, and, other, languages, morphological, analysis, is, the, process, of, segmenting, a, sentence, into, a, row, of, morphemes, morphological, analysis, is, closely, related, to, part, of, speech, tagging, but, word, segmentation, is, required, for, those, languages, because, word, boundaries, are, not, indicated, by, blank, spaces, the, purpose, of, morphological, analysis, is, to, determine, the, minimal, units, of, meaning, in, a, language, morphemes, by, comparison, of, similar, forms, such, as, comparing, she, is, walking, and, they, are, walking, with, each, other, rather, than, either, with, something, less, similar, like, you, are, reading, those, forms, can, be, effectively, broken, down, into, parts, and, the, different, morphemes, can, be, distinguished, both, meaning, and, form, are, equally, important, for, the, identification, of, morphemes, an, agent, morpheme, is, an, affix, like, er, that, in, english, transforms, a, verb, into, a, noun, e, g, teach, teacher, english, also, has, another, morpheme, that, is, identical, in, pronunciation, and, written, form, but, has, an, unrelated, meaning, and, function, a, comparative, morpheme, that, changes, an, adjective, into, another, degree, of, comparison, but, remains, the, same, adjective, e, g, small, smaller, the, opposite, can, also, occur, a, pair, of, morphemes, with, identical, meaning, but, different, forms, in, generative, grammar, the, definition, of, a, morpheme, depends, heavily, on, whether, syntactic, trees, have, morphemes, as, leaves, or, features, as, leaves, given, the, definition, of, a, morpheme, as, the, smallest, meaningful, unit, nanosyntax, aims, to, account, for, idioms, in, which, an, entire, syntactic, tree, often, contributes, the, smallest, meaningful, unit, an, example, idiom, is, don, t, let, the, cat, out, of, the, bag, there, the, idiom, is, composed, of, let, the, cat, out, of, the, bag, that, might, be, considered, a, semantic, morpheme, which, is, itself, composed, of, many, syntactic, morphemes, other, cases, of, the, smallest, meaningful, unit, being, longer, than, a, word, include, some, collocations, such, as, in, view, of, and, business, intelligence, in, which, the, words, when, together, have, a, specific, meaning, the, definition, of, morphemes, also, plays, a, significant, role, in, the, interfaces, of, generative, grammar, in, the, following, theoretical, constructs
