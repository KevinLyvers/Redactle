to, the, insinuation, that, islamism, is, anything, other, than, islam, renewed, and, revived, in, public, and, academic, contexts, the, term, islamism, has, been, criticized, as, having, been, given, connotations, of, violence, extremism, and, violations, of, human, rights, by, the, western, mass, media, leading, to, islamophobia, and, stereotyping, following, the, arab, spring, many, post, islamist, currents, became, heavily, involved, in, democratic, politics, while, others, spawned, the, most, aggressive, and, ambitious, islamist, militia, to, date, such, as, the, islamic, state, of, iraq, and, the, levant, isil, originally, the, term, islamism, was, simply, used, to, mean, the, religion, of, islam, not, an, ideology, or, movement, it, first, appeared, in, the, english, language, as, islamismus, in, 1696, and, as, islamism, in, 1712, the, term, appears, in, the, u, s, supreme, court, decision, in, in, re, ross, 1891, by, the, turn, of, the, twentieth, century, the, shorter, and, purely, arabic, term, islam, had, begun, to, displace, it, and, by, 1938, when, orientalist, scholars, completed, the, encyclopaedia, of, islam, islamism, seems, to, have, virtually, disappeared, from, english, usage, the, term, remained, practically, absent, from, the, vocabulary, of, scholars, writers, or, journalists, until, the, iranian, islamic, revolution, of, 1978, 79, which, brought, ayatollah, khomeini, s, concept, of, islamic, government, to, iran, this, new, usage, appeared, without, taking, into, consideration, how, the, term, islamist, m, sing, islami, pl, nom, acc, islamiyyun, gen, islamiyyin, f, sing, pl, islamiyyah, was, already, being, used, in, traditional, arabic, scholarship, in, a, theological, sense, as, in, relating, to, the, religion, of, islam, not, a, political, ideology, in, heresiographical, theological, and, historical, works, such, as, al, ash, ari, s, well, known, encyclopaedia, maq, l, t, al, isl, miyy, n, the, opinions, of, the, islamists, an, islamist, refers, to, any, person, who, attributes, himself, to, islam, without, affirming, nor, negating, that, attribution, if, used, consistently, it, is, for, impartiality, but, if, used, in, reference, to, a, certain, person, or, group, in, particular, without, others, it, implies, that, the, author, is, either, unsure, whether, to, affirm, or, negate, their, attribution, to, islam, or, trying, to, insinuate, his, disapproval, of, the, attribution, without, controversy, in, contrast, referring, to, a, person, as, a, muslim, or, a, kafir, implies, an, explicit, affirmation, or, a, negation, of, that, person, s, attribution, to, islam, to, evade, the, problem, resulting, from, the, confusion, between, the, western, and, arabic, usage, of, the, term, islamist, arab, journalists, invented, the, term, islamawi, islamian, instead, of, islami, islamist, in, reference, to, the, political, movement, though, this, term, is, sometimes, criticized, as, grammatically, incorrect, islamism, has, been, defined, as, islamists, simply, believe, that, their, movement, is, either, a, corrected, version, or, a, revival, of, islam, but, others, believe, that, islamism, is, a, modern, deviation, from, islam, which, should, either, be, denounced, or, dismissed, a, writer, for, the, international, crisis, group, maintains, that, the, conception, of, political, islam, is, a, creation, of, americans, to, explain, the, iranian, islamic, revolution, ignoring, the, fact, that, according, to, the, writer, islam, is, by, definition, political, in, fact, it, is, quietist, non, political, islam, not, islamism, that, requires, explanation, which, the, author, gives, calling, it, an, historical, fluke, of, the, short, lived, era, of, the, heyday, of, secular, arab, nationalism, between, 1945, and, 1970, hayri, abaza, argues, that, the, failure, to, distinguish, islam, from, islamism, leads, many, in, the, west, to, equate, the, two, they, think, that, by, supporting, illiberal, islamic, islamist, regimes, they, are, being, respectful, of, islam, to, the, detriment, of, those, who, seek, to, separate, religion, from, politics, another, source, distinguishes, islamist, from, islamic, by, emphasizing, the, fact, that, islam, refers, to, a, religion, and, culture, in, existence, over, a, millennium, whereas, islamism, is, a, political, religious, phenomenon, linked, to, the, great, events, of, the, 20th, century, islamists, have, at, least, at, times, defined, themselves, as, islamiyyoun, islamists, to, differentiate, themselves, from, muslimun, muslims, daniel, pipes, describes, islamism, as, a, modern, ideology, that, owes, more, to, european, utopian, political, ideologies, and, isms, than, to, the, traditional, islamic, religion, according, to, salman, sayyid, islamism, is, not, a, replacement, of, islam, akin, to, the, way, it, could, be, argued, that, communism, and, fascism, are, secularized, substitutes, for, christianity, rather, it, is, a, constellation, of, political, projects, that, seek, to, position, islam, in, the, centre, of, any, social, order, the, modern, revival, of, islamic, devotion, and, the, attraction, to, things, islamic, can, be, traced, to, several, events, by, the, end, of, world, war, i, most, muslim, states, were, seen, to, be, dominated, by, the, christian, leaning, western, states, explanations, offered, were, that, the, claims, of, islam, were, false, and, the, christian, or, post, christian, west, had, finally, come, up, with, another, system, that, was, superior, or, islam, had, failed, through, not, being, true, to, itself, the, second, explanation, being, preferred, by, muslims, a, redoubling, of, faith, and, devotion, by, the, faithful, was, called, for, to, reverse, this, tide, the, connection, between, the, lack, of, an, islamic, spirit, and, the, lack, of, victory, was, underscored, by, the, disastrous, defeat, of, arab, nationalist, led, armies, fighting, israel, under, the, slogan, land, sea, and, air, in, the, 1967, six, day, war, compared, to, the, perceived, near, victory, of, the, yom, kippur, war, six, years, later, in, that, war, the,

public, imagination, many, muslims, believe, as, saudi, prince, saud, al, faisal, did, that, the, hundreds, of, billions, of, dollars, in, wealth, obtained, from, the, persian, gulf, s, huge, oil, deposits, were, nothing, less, than, a, gift, from, god, to, the, islamic, faithful, as, the, islamic, revival, gained, momentum, governments, such, as, egypt, s, which, had, previously, repressed, and, was, still, continuing, to, repress, islamists, joined, the, bandwagon, they, banned, alcohol, and, flooded, the, airwaves, with, religious, programming, giving, the, movement, even, more,

clerical, world, and, many, felt, the, need, to, present, islam, not, as, a, traditional, religion, but, as, an, innovative, socio, political, ideology, of, a, modern, nation, state, the, reaction, to, new, realities, of, the, modern, world, gave, birth, to, islamist, ideologues, like, rashid, rida, and, abul, a, la, maududi, and, organizations, such, as, muslim, brotherhood, in, egypt, and,

e, fuller, as, part, of, identity, politics, specifically, the, religiously, oriented, nationalism, that, emerged, in, the, third, world, in, the, 1970s, resurgent, hinduism, in, india, religious, zionism, in, israel, militant, buddhism, in, sri, lanka, resurgent, sikh, nationalism, in, the, punjab, liberation, theology, of, catholicism, in, latin, america, and, islamism, in, the, muslim,

islam, properly, understood, olivier, roy, writes, that, the, failure, of, the, arab, socialist, model, left, room, for, new, protest, ideologies, to, emerge, in, deconstructed, societies, gilles, kepel, notes, that, when, a, collapse, in, oil, prices, led, to, widespread, violent, and, destructive, rioting, by, the, urban, poor, in, algeria, in, 1988, what, might, have, appeared, to, be, a, natural, opening, for, the, left, was, instead, the, beginning, of, major, victories, for, the, islamist, islamic, salvation, front, fis, party, the, reason, being, the, corruption, and, economic, malfunction, of, the, policies, of, the, third, world, socialist, ruling, party, fnl, had, largely, discredited, the, vocabulary, of, socialism, in, the, post, colonial, era, many, muslim, majority, states, such, as, indonesia, egypt, syria, and, iraq, were, ruled, by, authoritarian, regimes, which, were, often, continuously, dominated, by, the, same, individuals, or, their, cadres, for, decades, simultaneously, the, military, played, a, significant, part, in, the, government, decisions, in, many, of, these, states, the, outsized, role, played, by, the, military, could, be, seen, also, in, democratic, turkey, the, authoritarian, regimes, backed, by, military, support, took, extra, measures, to, silence, leftist, opposition, forces, often, with, the, help, of, foreign, powers, silencing, of, leftist, opposition, deprived, the, masses, a, channel, to, express, their, economic, grievances, and, frustration, toward, the, lack, of, democratic, processes, as, a, result, in, the, post, cold, war, era, civil, society, based, islamist, movements, such, as, the, muslim, brotherhood, were, the, only, organizations, capable, to, provide, avenues, of, protest, the, dynamic, was, repeated, after, the, states, had, gone, through, a, democratic, transition, in, indonesia, some, secular, political, parties, have, contributed, to, the, enactment, of, religious, bylaws, to, counter, the, popularity, of, islamist, oppositions, in, egypt, during, the, short, period, of, the, democratic, experiment, muslim, brotherhood, seized, the, momentum, by, being, the, most, cohesive, political, movement, among, the, opposition, few, observers, contest, the, immense, influence, of, islamism, within, the, muslim, world, following, the, collapse, of, the, soviet, union, political, movements, based, on, the, liberal, ideology, of, free, expression, and, democratic, rule, have, led, the, opposition, in, other, parts, of, the, world, such, as, latin, america, eastern, europe, and, many, parts, of, asia, however, the, simple, fact, is, that, political, islam, currently, reigns, as, the, most, powerful, ideological, force, across, the, muslim, world, today, the, strength, of, islamism, also, draws, from, the, strength, of, religiosity, in, general, in, the, muslim, world, compared, to, other, societies, around, the, globe, hat, is, striking, about, the, islamic, world, is, that, it, seems, to, have, been, the, least, penetrated, by, irreligion, where, other, peoples, may, look, to, the, physical, or, social, sciences, for, answers, in, areas, which, their, ancestors, regarded, as, best, left, to, scripture, in, the, muslim, world, religion, has, become, more, encompassing, not, less, as, in, the, last, few, decades, it, has, been, the, fundamentalists, who, have, increasingly, represented, the, cutting, edge, of, muslim, culture, writing, in, 2009, german, journalist, sonja, zekri, described, islamists, in, egypt, and, other, muslim, countries, as, extremely, influential, they, determine, how, one, dresses, what, one, eats, in, these, areas, they, are, incredibly, successful, even, if, the, islamists, never, come, to, power, they, have, transformed, their, countries, political, islamists, were, described, as, competing, in, the, democratic, public, square, in, places, like, turkey, tunisia, malaysia, and, indonesia, islamism, is, not, a, united, movement, and, takes, different, forms, and, spans, a, wide, range, of, strategies, and, tactics, towards, the, powers, in, place, destruction, opposition, collaboration, indifference, not, because, or, not, just, because, of, differences, of, opinions, but, because, it, varies, as, circumstances, change, p, 54, moderate, and, reformist, islamists, who, accept, and, work, within, the, democratic, process, include, parties, like, the, tunisian, ennahda, movement, some, islamists, can, be, religious, populists, or, far, right, jamaat, e, islami, of, pakistan, is, basically, a, socio, political, and, vanguard, party, working, with, in, pakistan, s, democratic, political, process, but, has, also, gained, political, influence, through, military, coup, d, tats, in, the, past, other, islamist, groups, like, hezbollah, in, lebanon, and, hamas, in, palestine, participate, in, the, democratic, and, political, process, as, well, as, armed, attacks, by, their, powerful, paramilitary, wings, jihadist, organizations, like, al, qaeda, and, the, egyptian, islamic, jihad, and, groups, such, as, the, taliban, entirely, reject, democracy, seeing, it, as, a, form, of, kufr, disbelief, calling, for, offensive, jihad, on, a, religious, basis, another, major, division, within, islamism, is, between, what, graham, e, fuller, has, described, as, the, conservative, guardians, of, the, tradition, salafis, such, as, those, in, the, wahhabi, movement, and, the, revolutionary, vanguard, of, change, and, islamic, reform, centered, around, the, muslim, brotherhood, olivier, roy, argues, that, sunni, pan, islamism, underwent, a, remarkable, shift, in, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, when, the, muslim, brotherhood, movement, and, its, focus, on, islamisation, of, pan, arabism, was, eclipsed, by, the, salafi, movement, with, its, emphasis, on, sharia, rather, than, the, building, of, islamic, institutions, following, the, arab, spring, starting, in, 2011, roy, has, described, islamism, as, increasingly, interdependent, with, democracy, in, much, of, the, arab, muslim, world, such, that, neither, can, now, survive, without, the, other, while, islamist, political, culture, itself, may, not, be, democratic, islamists, need, democratic, elections, to, maintain, their, legitimacy, at, the, same, time, their, popularity, is, such, that, no, government, can, call, itself, democratic, that, excludes, mainstream, islamist, groups, arguing, distinctions, between, radical, moderate, or, violent, peaceful, islamism, were, simplistic, circa, 2017, scholar, morten, valbj, rn, put, forth, these, much, more, sophisticated, typologies, of, islamism, throughout, the, 80s, and, 90s, major, moderate, islamist, movements, such, as, the, muslim, brotherhood, and, the, ennahda, were, excluded, from, democratic, political, participation, at, least, in, part, for, that, reason, islamists, attempted, to, overthrow, the, government, in, the, algerian, civil, war, 1991, 2002, and, waged, a, terror, campaign, in, egypt, in, the, 90s, these, attempts, were, crushed, and, in, the, 21st, century, islamists, turned, increasingly, to, non, violent, methods, and, moderate, islamists, now, make, up, the, majority, of, the, contemporary, islamist, movements, among, some, islamists, democracy, has, been, harmonized, with, islam, by, means, of, shura, consultation, the, tradition, of, consultation, by, the, ruler, being, considered, sunnah, of, the, prophet, muhammad, majlis, ash, shura, being, a, common, name, for, legislative, bodies, in, islamic, countries, among, the, varying, goals, strategies, and, outcomes, of, moderate, islamist, movements, are, a, formal, abandonment, of, their, original, vision, of, implementing, sharia, also, termed, post, islamism, done, by, the, ennahda, movement, of, tunisia, and, prosperous, justice, party, pks, of, indonesia, others, such, as, the, national, congress, of, sudan, have, implemented, the, sharia, with, support, from, wealthy, conservative, states, primarily, saudi, arabia, according, to, one, theory, inclusion, moderation, the, interdependence, of, political, outcome, with, strategy, means, that, the, more, moderate, the, islamists, become, the, more, likely, they, are, to, be, politically, included, or, unsuppressed, and, the, more, accommodating, the, government, is, the, less, extreme, islamists, become, a, prototype, of, harmonizing, islamist, principles, within, the, modern, state, framework, was, the, turkish, model, based, on, the, apparent, success, of, the, rule, of, the, turkish, justice, and, development, party, akp, led, by, recep, tayyip, erdo, an, turkish, model, however, came, unstuck, after, a, purge, and, violations, of, democratic, principles, by, the, erdo, an, regime, critics, of, the, concept, which, include, both, islamists, who, reject, democracy, and, anti, islamists, hold, that, islamist, aspirations, are, fundamentally, incompatible, with, the, democratic, principles, politics, portal, the, contemporary, salafi, movement, is, sometimes, described, as, a, variety, of, islamism, and, sometimes, as, a, different, school, of, islam, such, as, a, phase, between, fundamentalism, and, islamism, originally, a, reformist, movement, of, jamal, al, din, al, afghani, muhammad, abdul, and, rashid, rida, that, rejected, maraboutism, sufism, the, established, schools, of, fiqh, and, demanded, individual, interpretation, ijtihad, of, the, quran, and, sunnah, it, evolved, into, a, movement, embracing, the, conservative, doctrines, of, the, medieval, hanbali, theologian, ibn, taymiyyah, while, all, salafi, believe, islam, covers, every, aspect, of, life, that, sharia, law, must, be, implemented, completely, and, that, the, caliphate, must, be, recreated, to, rule, the, muslim, world, they, differ, in, strategies, and, priorities, which, generally, fall, into, three, groups, one, of, the, antecedents, of, the, contemporary, salafi, movement, is, wahhabism, an, 18th, century, reform, movement, from, the, arabia, founded, by, muhammad, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, ibn, abd, al, wahhab, gave, his, bay, ah, pledge, of, allegiance, to, a, ruler, commander, to, the, house, of, saud, the, rulers, of, saudi, arabia, and, so, have, almost, all, wahhabi, since, small, numbers, have, become, salafi, jihadist, or, other, dissidents, obedience, to, a, ruler, precluding, any, political, activism, short, of, an, advisor, whispering, advice, to, the, ruler, there, are, few, wahhabi, islamists, at, least, in, saudi, arabia, wahhabism, and, salafism, more, or, less, merged, by, the, 1960s, in, saudi, arabia, and, together, they, benefited, from, 100s, of, billions, in, state, sponsored, worldwide, propagation, of, conservative, islam, financed, by, saudi, petroleum, exports, a, phenomenon, often, dubbed, as, petro, islam, this, financing, has, contributed, indirectly, to, the, upsurge, of, salafi, jihadism, qutbism, refers, to, the, jihadist, ideology, formulated, by, sayyid, qutb, an, influential, figure, of, the, muslim, brotherhood, in, egypt, during, the, 50s, and, 60s, qutbism, argued, that, not, only, was, sharia,

of, the, establishment, of, an, islamic, state, and, eventually, a, new, caliphate, other, characteristics, of, the, movement, include, the, formal, process, of, taking, bay, ah, oath, of, allegiance,

and, reporting, about, islamism, or, political, islam, has, been, focused, on, sunni, islamist, movements, islamism, exists, in, twelver, shia, islam, the, second, largest, branch, of, islam, that, makes, up, approximately, 10, of, all, muslims, islamist, shi, ism, also, known, as, shi, i, islamism, is, primarily, but, not, exclusively, associated, with, the, thought, of, ayatollah, ruhollah, khomeini, with, the, islamist, revolution, he, led, islamic, republic, of, iran, that, he, founded, and, the, religious, political, activities, and, resources, of, the, republic, compared, to, the, types, of, islamism, mentioned, above, khomeinism, differs, from, wahhabism, which, does, not, consider, shi, ism, truly, islamic, salafism, both, orthodox, or, jihadi, shi, a, do, not, consider, some, of, the, most, prominent, salaf, worthy, of, emulation, reformist, islamism, the, islamic, republic, executed, more, than, 3, 400, political, dissidents, between, june, 1981, and, march, 1982, in, the, process, of, consolidating, power, khomeini, and, his, followers, helped, translate, the, works, of, maududi, and, qutb, into, persian, and, were, influenced, by, them, but, their, views, differed, from, them, and, other, sunni, islamists, in, being, more, leftist, and, more, clerical, khomeini, was, a, radical, islamist, like, qutb, and, unlike, maudidi, he, believed, that, foreigners, jews, and, their, agents, were, conspiring, to, keep, us, backward, to, keep, us, in, our, present, miserable, state, those, who, call, themselves, muslims, but, were, secular, and, westernizing, were, not, just, corrupt, or, misguided, but, agents, of, the, western, governments, helping, to, plunder, muslim, lands, as, part, of, a, long, term, conspiracy, against, islam, only, the, rule, of, an, islamic, jurist, administering, sharia, law, stood, between, this, abomination, and, justice, and, could, not, wait, for, peaceful, gradual, transition, it, is, the, duty, of, muslims, to, destroy, all, traces, of, any, other, sort, of, government, other, than, true, islamic, governance, because, these, are, systems, of, unbelief, troublesome, groups, that, cause, corruption, in, muslim, society, and, damage, islam, and, the, islamic, state, are, to, be, eliminated, just, as, the, prophet, muhammad, eliminated, the, jews, of, bani, qurayza, islamic, revolution,

in, the, world, will, be, able, to, resist, it, they, will, all, capitulate, khomeini, s, form, of, islamism, was, particularly, unique, in, the, world, because, it, completely, swept, the, old, regime, away, created, a, new, regime, with, a, new, constitution, new, institutions, and, a, new, concept, of, governance, the, velayat, e, faqih, a, historical, event, it, changed, militant, islam, from, a, topic, of, limited, impact, and, interest, to, a, topic, that, few, either, inside, or, outside, the, muslim, world, were, unaware, of, as, he, originally, described, it, in, lectures, to, his, students, the, system, of, islamic, government, was, one, where, the, leading, islamic, jurist, would, enforce, sharia, law, law, which, has, absolute, authority, over, all, individuals, and, the, islamic, government, the, jurist, would, not, be, elected, and, no, legislature, would, be, needed, since, divine, law, called, for, rule, by, jurist, and, there, is, not, a, single, topic, in, human, life, for, which, islam, has, not, provided, instruction, and, established, a, norm, without, this, system, injustice, corruption, waste, exploitation, and, sin, would, reign, and, islam, would, decay, this, plan, was, disclosed, to, his, students, and, the, religious, community, but, not, widely, publicized, the, constitution, of, the, islamic, republic, written, after, the, revolution, did, include, a, legislature, and, president, but, supervising, the, entire, government, was, a, supreme, leader, guardian, jurist, islamist, shi, ism, has, been, crucial, to, the, development, of, worldwide, islamism, because, the, iranian, regime, attempted, to, export, its, revolution, although, the, islamist, ideology, was, originally, imported, from, muslim, brotherhood, iranian, relations, between, the, muslim, brotherhood, and, islamic, republic, of, iran, deteriorated, due, to, its, involvement, in, the, syrian, civil, war, however, the, majority, usuli, shi, ism,

the, middle, east, and, south, asia, the, islamic, republic, of, iran, has, become, the, de, facto, leader, of, the, shi, i, world, by, virtue, of, being, the, largest, shia, majority, state, having, a, long, history, of, national, cohesion, and, shia, rule, being, the, site, of, the, first, and, only, true, islamist, revolution, see, history, section, below, and, having, the, financial,

and, their, organizations, particularly, sayyid, rashid, rida, hassan, al, banna, founder, of, the, muslim, brotherhood, organization, sayyid, qutb, abul, a, la, maududi, but, has, also, been, described, as, distinct, from, sunni, muslim, brotherhood, islamism, more, leftist, and, more, clerical, with, its, own, historical, influencers, some, western, political, scientists, see, the,

basic, community, services, including, schools, mosques, and, workshops, like, maududi, al, banna, believed, in, the, necessity, of, government, rule, based, on, shariah, law, implemented, gradually, and, by, persuasion, and, of, eliminating, all, western, imperialist, influence, in, the, muslim, world, some, elements, of, the, brotherhood, did, engage, in, violence, assassinating, egypt, s, premier, mahmoud, fahmy, el, nokrashy, in, 1948, mb, founder, al, banna, was, assassinated, in, retaliation, three, months, later, the, brotherhood, has, suffered, periodic, repression, in, egypt, and, has, been, banned, several, times, in, 1948, and, several, years, later, following, confrontations, with, egyptian, president, gamal, abdul, nasser, who, jailed, thousands, of, members, for, several, years, the, brotherhood, expanded, to, many, other, countries, particularly, in, the, arab, world, in, egypt, despite, periodic, repression, for, many, years, it, was, described, as, semi,

what, were, perceived, as, undemocratic, moves, by, him, today, the, muslim, brotherhood, is, designated, as, a, terrorist, organization, by, bahrain, russia, syria, egypt, saudi, arabia, and, the, united, arab, emirates, qutb, a, leading, member, of, the, muslim, brotherhood, movement, is, considered, by, some, fawaz, a, gerges, to, be, the, founding, father, and, leading, theoretician, of, modern, jihadists, such, as, osama, bin, laden, he, was, executed, for, allegedly, participating, in, a, presidential, assassination, plot, in, 1966, maududi, s, political, ideas, influenced, sayyid, qutb, like, maududi, he, believed, sharia, was, crucial, to, islam, so, the, restoration, of, its, full, enforcement, was, vital, to, the, world, since, sharia, had, not, been, fully, enforced, for, centuries, islam, had, been, extinct, for, a, few, centuries, qutb, preached, that, muslims, must, engage, in, a, two, pronged, attack, of, converting, individuals, through, preaching, islam, peacefully, but, also, using, physical, power, and, jihad, force, was, necessary, because, those, who, have, usurped, the, authority, of, god, would, not, give, up, their, power, through, friendly, persuasion, like, khomeini, whom, he, influenced, he, believed, the, west, was, engaged, in, a, vicious, centuries, long, war, against, islam, the, defeat, of, the, armies, of, several, arab, states, by, israel, during, the, six, day, war, marked, a, significant, moment, in, the, arab, world, the, loss, coupled, with, economic, stagnation, in, these, countries, was, attributed, by, some, to, the, secular, arab, nationalism, of, the, ruling, regimes, this, period, saw, a, decline, in, the, popularity, and, credibility, of, secular, socialist, and, nationalist, ideologies, such, as, ba, athism, arab, socialism, and, arab, nationalism, in, contrast, various, islamist, movements, both, democratic, and, anti, democratic, inspired, by, figures, like, maududi, and, sayyid, qutb, began, to, gain, influence, the, first, modern, islamist, state, with, the, possible, exception, of, zia, s, pakistan, was, established, among, the, shia, of, iran, in, a, major, shock, to, the, rest, of, the, world, muslim, and, non, muslim, a, revolution, led, by, ayatollah, ruhollah, khomeini, overthrew, the, secular, oil, rich, well, armed, pro, american, monarchy, of, shah, muhammad, reza, pahlavi, the, revolution, was, an, indisputable, sea, change, islamism, had, been, a, topic, of, limited, impact, and, interest, before, 1979, but, after, the, revolution, nobody, within, the, muslim, world, or, outside, it, remained, unaware, of, militant, islam, enthusiasm, for, the, iranian, revolution, in, the, muslim, world, could, be, intense, and, there, were, many, reasons, for, optimism, among, islamists, outside, iran, khomeini, was, implementing, islamic, law, he, was, interested, in, pan, islamic, and, pan, islamist, unity, and, made, efforts, to, bridge, the, gap, between, shiites, and, sunnis, declaring, it, permissible, for, shiites, to, pray, behind, sunni, imams, and, forbidding, shiites, from, criticizing, the, caliphs, who, preceded, ali, revered, by, sunnis, but, not, shia, the, islamic, republic, also, downplayed, shia, rituals, such, as, the, day, of, ashura, and, shrines, before, the, revolution, khomeini, acolytes, such, as, today, s, supreme, leader, of, iran, ali, khamenei, translated, and, championed, the, works, of, the, muslim, brotherhood, jihadist, theorist, sayyid, qutb, and, other, sunni, islamists, revivalists, this, campaign, did, not, survive, his, death, however, as, previously, submissive, shia, usually, minorities, became, more, assertive, sunnis, saw, mostly, shia, mischief, and, a, challenge, to, sunni, dominance, what, followed, was, a, sunni, versus, shia, contest, for, dominance, and, it, grew, intense, animosity, between, the, two, sects, in, iran, and, its, neighbors, is, systemic, as, of, 2014, with, thousands, killed, from, sectarian, fighting, in, iraq, and, pakistan, also, tarnishing, the, revolution, s, image, have, been, purges, executions, and, atrocities, and, periodic, and, increasingly, widespread, domestic, unrest, and, protest, by, young, iranians, among, the, most, important, by, products, of, the, iranian, revolution, according, to, mehrzad, boroujerdi, as, of, 2014, include, the, emergence, of, hezbollah, in, lebanon, the, moral, boost, provided, to, shia, forces, in, iraq, the, regional, cold, war, against, saudi, arabia, and, israel, lending, an, islamic, flavour, to, the, anti, imperialist, anti, american, sentiment, in, the, middle, east, and, inadvertently, widening, the, sunni, shia, cleavage, the, islamic, republic, has, also, maintained, its, hold, on, power, in, iran, in, spite, of, us, economic, sanctions, and, has, created, or, assisted, like, minded, shia, terrorist, groups, in, iraq, sciri, and, lebanon, hezbollah, two, muslim, countries, that, also, have, a, large, percentage, of, shiites, the, campaign, to, overthrow, the, shah, led, by, khomeini, had, had, a, strong, class, flavor, khomeini, preached, that, the, shah, was, widening, the, gap, between, rich, and, poor, condemning, the, working, class, to, a, life, of, poverty, misery, and, drudgery, etc, and, the, pro, rural, and, pro, poor, approach, has, led, to, almost, universal, access, to, electricity, and, clean, water, but, critics, of, the, regime, complain, of, promises, made, and, not, kept, the, sons, of, the, revolution, s, leaders, and, the, business, class, that, decides, to, work, within, the, rules, of, the, regime, flaunt, their, wealth, driving, luxury, sportscars, around, tehran, posting, instagram, pictures, of, their, ski, trips, and, beach, trips, around, the, world, all, while, the, poor, and, the, middle, class, are, struggling, to, survive, or, maintain, the, appearance, of, a, dignified, life, according, to, shadi, mokhtari, one, commitment, made, to, his, followers, if, not, the, iranian, public, that, has, been, kept, is, guardianship, by, the, islamic, jurist, but, rather, than, strengthening, islam, and, eliminating, secular, values, and, practices, the, regime, has, ruined, the, iranian, people, s, belief, in, religion, anonymous, expert, the, strength, of, the, islamist, movement, was, manifest, in, an, event, which, might, have, seemed, sure, to, turn, muslim, public, opinion, against, fundamentalism, but, did, just, the, opposite, in, 1979, the, grand, mosque, in, mecca, saudi, arabia, was, seized, by, an, armed, fundamentalist, group, and, held, for, over, a, week, scores, were, killed, including, many, pilgrim, bystanders, in, a, gross, violation, of, one, of, the, most, holy, sites, in, islam, and, one, where, arms, and, violence, are, strictly, forbidden, instead, of, prompting, a, backlash, against, the, movement, that, inspired, the, attackers, however, saudi, arabia, already, very, conservative, responded, by, shoring, up, its, fundamentalist, credentials, with, even, more, islamic, restrictions, crackdowns, followed, on, everything, from, shopkeepers, who, did, not, close, for, prayer, and, newspapers, that, published, pictures, of, women, to, the, selling, of, dolls, teddy, bears, images, of, animate, objects, are, considered, haraam, and, dog, food, dogs, are, considered, unclean, in, other, muslim, countries, blame, for, and, wrath, against, the, seizure, was, directed, not, against, fundamentalists, but, against, islamic, fundamentalism, s, foremost, geopolitical, enemy, the, united, states, ayatollah, khomeini, sparked, attacks, on, american, embassies, when, he, announced, it, is, not, beyond, guessing, that, this, is, the, work, of, criminal, american, imperialism, and, international, zionism, despite, the, fact, that, the, object, of, the, fundamentalists, revolt, was, the, kingdom, of, saudi, arabia, america, s, major, ally, in, the, region, anti, american, demonstrations, followed, in, the, philippines, turkey, bangladesh, india, the, uae, pakistan, and, kuwait, the, us, embassy, in, libya, was, burned, by, protesters, chanting, pro, khomeini, slogans, and, the, embassy, in, islamabad, pakistan, was, burned, to, the, ground, in, 1979, the, soviet, union, deployed, its, 40th, army, into, afghanistan, attempting, to, suppress, an, islamic, rebellion, against, an, allied, marxist, regime, in, the, afghan, civil, war, the, conflict, pitting, indigenous, impoverished, muslims, mujahideen, against, an, anti, religious, superpower, galvanized, thousands, of, muslims, around, the, world, to, send, aid, and, sometimes, to, go, themselves, to, fight, for, their, faith, leading, this, pan, islamic, effort, was, palestinian, alim, abdullah, yusuf, azzam, while, the, military, effectiveness, of, these, afghan, arabs, was, marginal, an, estimated, 16, 000, to, 35, 000, muslim, volunteers, came, from, around, the, world, to, fight, in, afghanistan, when, the, soviet, union, abandoned, the, marxist, najibullah, regime, and, withdrew, from, afghanistan, in, 1989, the, regime, finally, fell, in, 1992, the, victory, was, seen, by, many, muslims, as, the, triumph, of, islamic, faith, over, superior, military, power, and, technology, that, could, be, duplicated, elsewhere, the, jihadists, gained, legitimacy, and, prestige, from, their, triumph, both, within, the, militant, community, and, among, ordinary, muslims, as, well, as, the, confidence, to, carry, their, jihad, to, other, countries, where, they, believed, muslims, required, assistance, the, collapse, of, the, soviet, union, itself, in, 1991, was, seen, by, many, islamists, including, bin, laden, as, the, defeat, of, a, superpower, at, the, hands, of, islam, concerning, the, 6, billion, in, aid, given, by, the, us, and, pakistan, s, military, training, and, intelligence, support, to, the, mujahideen, bin, laden, wrote, he, us, has, no, mentionable, role, in, the, collapse, of, the, soviet, union, rather, the, credit, goes, to, god, and, the, mujahidin, of, afghanistan, another, factor, in, the, early, 1990s, that, worked, to, radicalize, the, islamist, movement, was, the, gulf, war, which, brought, several, hundred, thousand, us, and, allied, non, muslim, military, personnel, to, saudi, arabian, soil, to, put, an, end, to, saddam, hussein, s, occupation, of, kuwait, prior, to, 1990, saudi, arabia, played, an, important, role, in, restraining, the, many, islamist, groups, that, received, its, aid, but, when, saddam, secularist, and, ba, athist, dictator, of, neighboring, iraq, attacked, kuwait, his, enemy, in, the, war, western, troops, came, to, protect, the, saudi, monarchy, islamists, accused, the, saudi, regime, of, being, a, puppet, of, the, west, these, attacks, resonated, with, conservative, muslims, and, the, problem, did, not, go, away, with, saddam, s, defeat, either, since, american, troops, remained, stationed, in, the, kingdom, and, a, de, facto, cooperation, with, the, palestinian, israeli, peace, process, developed, saudi, arabia, attempted, to, compensate, for, its, loss, of, prestige, among, these, groups, by, repressing, those, domestic, islamists, who, attacked, it, bin, laden, being, a, prime, example, and, increasing, aid, to, islamic, groups, islamist, madrassas, around, the, world, and, even, aiding, some, violent, islamist, groups, that, did, not, but, its, pre, war, influence, on, behalf, of, moderation, was, greatly, reduced, one, result, of, this, was, a, campaign, of, attacks, on, government, officials, and, tourists, in, egypt, a, bloody, civil, war, in, algeria, and, osama, bin, laden, s, terror, attacks, climaxing, in, the, 9, 11, attack, by, the, beginning, of, the, twenty, first, century, the, word, secular, a, label, proudly, worn, in, the, 1960s, and, 70s, was, shunned, and, used, to, besmirch, political, foes, in, egypt, and, the, rest, of, the, muslim, world, islamists, surpassed, the, small, secular, opposition, parties, in, terms, of, doggedness, courage, risk, taking, or, organizational, skills, as, of, 2002, in, the, middle, east, and, pakistan, religious, discourse, dominates, societies, the, airwaves, and, thinking, about, the, world, radical, mosques, have, proliferated, throughout, egypt, book, stores, are, dominated, by, works, with, religious, themes, the, demand, for, sharia, the, belief, that, their, governments, are, unfaithful, to, islam, and, that, islam, is, the, answer, to, all, problems, and, the, certainty, that, the, west, has, declared, war, on, islam, these, are, the, themes, that, dominate, public, discussion, islamists, may, not, control, parliaments, or, government, palaces, but, they, have, occupied, the, popular, imagination, opinion, polls, in, a, variety, of, islamic, countries, showed, that, significant, majorities, opposed, groups, like, isis, but, also, wanted, religion, to, play, a, greater, role, in, public, life, by, 2020, approximately, 40, years, after, the, islamic, overthrow, of, the, shah, of, iran, and, the, seizure, of, the, grand, mosque, by, extremists, a, number, of, observers, olivier, roy, mustafa, akyol, nader, hashemi, detected, a, decline, in, the, vigor, and, popularity, of, islamism, islamism, had, been, an, idealized, utopian, concept, to, compare, with, the, grim, reality, of, the, status, quo, but, in, more, than, four, decades, it, had, failed, to, establish, a, concrete, and, viable, blueprint, for, society, despite, repeated, efforts, olivier, roy, and, instead, had, left, a, less, than, inspiring, track, record, of, its, impact, on, the, world, nader, hashemi, consequently, in, addition, to, the, trend, towards, moderation, by, islamist, or, formerly, islamist, parties, such, as, pks, of, indonesia, akp, of, turkey, and, pas, of, malaysia, mentioned, above, there, has, been, a, social, religious, and, sometimes, political, backlash, against, islamist, rule, in, countries, like, turkey, iran, and, sudan, mustafa, akyol, writing, in, 2020, mustafa, akyol, argues, there, has, been, a, strong, reaction, by, many, muslims, against, political, islam, including, a, weakening, of, religious, faith, the, very, thing, islamism, was, intended, to, strengthen, he, suggests, this, backlash, against, islamism, among, muslim, youth, has, come, from, all, the, terrible, things, that, have, happened, in, the, arab, world, in, the, twenty, first, century, in, the, name, of, islam, such, as, the, sectarian, civil, wars, in, syria, iraq, and, yemen, polls, taken, by, arab, barometer, in, six, arab, countries, algeria, egypt, tunisia, jordan, iraq, and, libya, found, arabs, are, losing, faith, in, religious, parties, and, leaders, in, 2018, 19, in, all, six, countries, fewer, than, 20, of, those, asked, whether, they, trusted, islamist, parties, answered, in, the, affirmative, that, percentage, had, fallen, in, all, six, countries, from, when, the, same, question, was, asked, in, 2012, 14, mosque, attendance, also, declined, more, than, 10, points, on, average, and, the, share, of, those, arabs, describing, themselves, as, not, religious, went, from, 8, in, 2013, to, 13, in, 2018, 19, in, syria, sham, al, ali, reports, rising, apostasy, among, syrian, youths, writing, in, 2021, nader, hashemi, notes, that, in, iraq, sudan, tunisia, egypt, gaza, jordan, and, other, places, were, islamist, parties, have, come, to, power, or, campaigned, to, one, general, theme, stands, the, popular, prestige, of, political, islam, has, been, tarnished, by, its, experience, with, state, power, in, iran, hardline, ayatollah, mohammad, taqi, mesbah, yazdi, has, complained, iranians, are, evading, religious, teachings, and, turning, to, secularism, even, islamist, terrorism, was, in, decline, and, tended, to, be, local, rather, than, pan, islamic, as, of, 2021, al, qaeda, consisted, of, a, bunch, of, militias, with, no, effective, central, command, fareed, zakaria, islamism, or, elements, of, islamism, have, been, criticized, on, numerous, grounds, including, repression, of, free, expression, and, individual, rights, rigidity,
