a, refugee, conventionally, speaking, is, a, person, who, has, lost, the, protection, of, their, country, of, origin, and, who, cannot, or, is, unwilling, to, return, there, due, to, well, founded, fear, of, persecution, such, a, person, may, be, called, an, asylum, seeker, until, granted, refugee, status, by, a, contracting, state, or, by, the, united, nations, high, commissioner, for, refugees, unhcr, if, they, formally, make, a, claim, for, asylum, in, english, the, term, refugee, derives, from, the, root, word, refuge, from, old, french, refuge, meaning, hiding, place, it, refers, to, shelter, or, protection, from, danger, or, distress, from, latin, fugere, to, flee, and, refugium, a, taking, refuge, place, to, flee, back, to, in, western, history, the, term, was, first, applied, to, french, protestant, huguenots, looking, for, a, safe, place, against, catholic, persecution, after, the, first, edict, of, fontainebleau, in, 1540, the, word, appeared, in, the, english, language, when, french, huguenots, fled, to, britain, in, large, numbers, after, the, 1685, edict, of, fontainebleau, the, revocation, of, the, 1598, edict, of, nantes, in, france, and, the, 1687, declaration, of, indulgence, in, england, and, scotland, the, word, meant, one, seeking, asylum, until, around, 1916, when, it, evolved, to, mean, one, fleeing, home, applied, in, this, instance, to, civilians, in, flanders, heading, west, to, escape, fighting, in, world, war, i, the, first, modern, definition, of, an, international, refugee, status, came, with, the, league, of, nations, in, 1921, from, the, commission, for, refugees, following, world, war, ii, and, in, response, to, the, large, numbers, of, people, fleeing, eastern, europe, the, united, nations, passed, the, 1951, convention, relating, to, the, status, of, refugees, it, defines, refugee, in, article, 1, a, 2, as, any, person, who, owing, to, well, founded, fear, of, being, persecuted, for, reasons, of, race, religion, nationality, membership, of, a, particular, social, group, or, political, opinion, is, outside, the, country, of, his, nationality, and, is, unable, or, owing, to, such, fear, is, unwilling, to, avail, himself, of, the, protection, of, that, country, or, who, not, having, a, nationality, and, being, outside, the, country, of, his, former, habitual, residence, as, a, result, of, such, events, is, unable, or, owing, to, such, fear, is, unwilling, to, return, to, it, in, 1967, the, definition, was, basically, confirmed, by, the, protocol, relating, to, the, status, of, refugees, people, fleeing, from, war, natural, disasters, or, poverty, are, generally, not, encompassed, by, the, international, right, of, asylum, however, many, countries, have, implemented, laws, to, protect, also, those, displaced, persons, accordingly, the, convention, governing, the, specific, aspects, of, refugee, problems, in, africa, expanded, the, 1951, definition, which, the, organization, of, african, unity, adopted, in, 1969, every, person, who, owing, to, external, aggression, occupation, foreign, domination, or, events, seriously, disturbing, public, order, in, either, part, or, the, whole, of, his, country, of, origin, or, nationality, is, compelled, to, leave, his, place, of, habitual, residence, in, order, to, seek, refuge, in, another, place, outside, his, country, of, origin, or, nationality, the, 1984, the, regional, non, binding, latin, american, cartagena, declaration, on, refugees, included, the, following, definition, of, refugees, persons, who, have, fled, their, country, because, their, lives, safety, or, freedom, have, been, threatened, by, generalized, violence, foreign, aggression, internal, conflicts, massive, violation, of, human, rights, or, other, circumstances, which, have, seriously, disturbed, public, order, as, of, 2011, the, united, nations, high, commissioner, for, refugees, unhcr, itself, in, addition, to, the, 1951, definition, recognizes, the, following, persons, as, refugees, who, are, outside, their, country, of, nationality, or, habitual, residence, and, unable, to, return, there, owing, to, serious, and, indiscriminate, threats, to, life, physical, integrity, or, freedom, resulting, from, generalized, violence, or, events, seriously, disturbing, public, order, the, european, union, passed, minimum, standards, as, part, of, its, definition, of, refugee, underlined, by, article, 2, c, of, directive, no, 2004, 83, ec, essentially, reproducing, the, narrow, definition, of, refugee, offered, by, the, un, 1951, convention, nevertheless, by, virtue, of, articles, 2, e, and, 15, of, the, same, directive, persons, who, have, fled, a, war, caused, generalized, violence, are, at, certain, conditions, eligible, for, a, complementary, form, of, protection, called, subsidiary, protection, the, same, form, of, protection, is, foreseen, for, displaced, people, who, without, being, refugees, are, nevertheless, exposed, if, returned, to, their, countries, of, origin, to, death, penalty, torture, or, other, inhuman, or, degrading, treatments, unrwa, has, an, alternate, definition, of, what, is, a, refugee, an, article, in, the, foreign, press, describes, this, the, agency, defines, palestinian, refugees, as, persons, whose, normal, place, of, residence, was, palestine, during, the, period, 1, june, 1946, to, 15, may, 1948, and, who, lost, both, home, and, means, of, livelihood, as, a, result, of, the, 1948, conflict, in, 1965, unrwa, changed, the, eligibility, requirements, to, be, a, palestinian, refugee, to, include, third, generation, descendants, and, in, 1982, it, extended, it, again, to, include, all, descendants, of, palestine, refugee, males, including, legally, adopted, children, regardless, of, whether, they, had, been, granted, citizenship, elsewhere, this, classification, process, is, inconsistent, with, how, all, other, refugees, in, the, world, are, classified, including, the, definition, used, by, the, united, nations, high, commissioner, for, refugees, unhcr, and, the, laws, concerning, refugees, in, the, united, states, refugee, resettlement, is, defined, as, an, organized, process, of, selection, transfer, and, arrival, of, individuals, to, another, country, this, definition, is, restrictive, as, it, does, not, account, for, the, increasing, prevalence, of, unmanaged, migration, processes, the, term, refugee, relocation, refers, to, a, non, organized, process, of, individual, transfer, to, another, country, refugee, settlement, refers, to, the, process, of, basic, adjustment, to, life, often, in, the, early, stages, of, transition, to, the, new, country, including, securing, access, to, housing, education, healthcare, documentation, and, legal, rights, employment, is, sometimes, included, in, this, process, but, the, focus, is, generally, on, short, term, survival, needs, rather, than, long, term, career, planning, refugee, integration, means, a, dynamic, long, term, process, in, which, a, newcomer, becomes, a, full, and, equal, participant, in, the, receiving, society, compared, to, the, general, construct, of, settlement, refugee, integration, has, a, greater, focus, on, social, cultural, and, structural, dimensions, this, process, includes, the, acquisition, of, legal, rights, mastering, the, language, and, culture, reaching, safety, and, stability, developing, social, connections, and, establishing, the, means, and, markers, of, integration, such, as, employment, housing, and, health, refugee, workforce, integration, is, understood, to, be, a, process, in, which, refugees, engage, in, economic, activities, employment, or, self, employment, which, are, commensurate, with, individuals, professional, goals, and, previous, qualifications, and, experience, and, provide, adequate, economic, security, and, prospects, for, career, advancement, the, idea, that, a, person, who, sought, sanctuary, in, a, holy, place, could, not, be, harmed, without, inviting, divine, retribution, was, familiar, to, the, ancient, greeks, and, ancient, egyptians, however, the, right, to, seek, asylum, in, a, church, or, other, holy, place, was, first, codified, in, law, by, king, thelberht, of, kent, in, about, ad, 600, similar, laws, were, implemented, throughout, europe, in, the, middle, ages, the, related, concept, of, political, exile, also, has, a, long, history, ovid, was, sent, to, tomis, voltaire, was, sent, to, england, by, the, 1648, peace, of, westphalia, nations, recognized, each, other, s, sovereignty, however, it, was, not, until, the, advent, of, romantic, nationalism, in, late, 18th, century, europe, that, nationalism, gained, sufficient, prevalence, for, the, phrase, country, of, nationality, to, become, practically, meaningful, and, for, border, crossing, to, require, that, people, provide, identification, the, term, refugee, sometimes, applies, to, people, who, might, fit, the, definition, outlined, by, the, 1951, convention, were, it, applied, retroactively, there, are, many, candidates, for, example, after, the, edict, of, fontainebleau, in, 1685, outlawed, protestantism, in, france, hundreds, of, thousands, of, huguenots, fled, to, england, the, netherlands, switzerland, south, africa, germany, and, prussia, the, repeated, waves, of, pogroms, that, swept, eastern, europe, in, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, prompted, mass, jewish, emigration, more, than, 2, million, russian, jews, emigrated, in, the, period, 1881, 1920, between, the, crimean, war, of, 1853, 56, and, world, war, i, at, least, 2, 5, million, muslims, arrived, in, the, ottoman, empire, as, refugees, primarily, from, russia, and, the, balkans, the, balkan, wars, of, 1912, 1913, caused, 800, 000, people, to, leave, their, homes, various, groups, of, people, were, officially, designated, refugees, beginning, in, world, war, i, however, when, the, first, world, war, began, there, were, no, rules, in, international, law, specifically, dealing, with, the, situation, of, refugees, the, first, international, co, ordination, of, refugee, affairs, came, with, the, creation, by, the, league, of, nations, in, 1921, of, the, high, commission, for, refugees, and, the, appointment, of, fridtjof, nansen, as, its, head, nansen, and, the, commission, were, charged, with, assisting, the, approximately, 1, 500, 000, people, who, fled, the, russian, revolution, of, 1917, and, the, subsequent, civil, war, 1917, 1921, most, of, them, aristocrats, fleeing, the, communist, government, it, is, estimated, that, about, 800, 000, russian, refugees, became, stateless, when, lenin, revoked, citizenship, for, all, russian, expatriates, in, 1921, in, 1923, the, mandate, of, the, commission, was, expanded, to, include, the, more, than, one, million, armenians, who, left, turkish, asia, minor, in, 1915, and, 1923, due, to, a, series, of, events, now, known, as, the, armenian, genocide, over, the, next, several, years, the, mandate, was, expanded, further, to, cover, assyrians, and, turkish, refugees, in, all, of, these, cases, a, refugee, was, defined, as, a, person, in, a, group, for, which, the, league, of, nations, had, approved, a, mandate, as, opposed, to, a, person, to, whom, a, general, definition, applied, the, 1923, population, exchange, between, greece, and, turkey, involved, about, two, million, people, around, 1, 5, million, anatolian, greeks, and, 500, 000, muslims, in, greece, most, of, whom, were, forcibly, repatriated, and, denaturalized, from, homelands, of, centuries, or, millennia, and, guaranteed, the, nationality, of, the, destination, country, by, a, treaty, promoted, and, overseen, by, the, international, community, as, part, of, the, treaty, of, lausanne, 1923, the, u, s, congress, passed, the, emergency, quota, act, in, 1921, followed, by, the, immigration, act, of, 1924, the, immigration, act, of, 1924, was, aimed, at, further, restricting, the, southern, and, eastern, europeans, especially, jews, italians, and, slavs, who, had, begun, to, enter, the, country, in, large, numbers, beginning, in, the, 1890s, most, european, refugees, principally, jews, and, slavs, fleeing, the, nazis, and, the, soviet, union, were, barred, from, going, to, the, united, states, until, after, world, war, ii, when, congress, enacted, the, temporary, displaced, persons, act, in, 1948, in, 1930, the, nansen, international, office, for, refugees, nansen, office, was, established, as, a, successor, agency, to, the, commission, its, most, notable, achievement, was, the, nansen, passport, a, refugee, travel, document, for, which, it, was, awarded, the, 1938, nobel, peace, prize, the, nansen, office, was, plagued, by, problems, of, financing, an, increase, in, refugee, numbers, and, a, lack, of, co, operation, from, some, member, states, which, led, to, mixed, success, overall, however, the, nansen, office, managed, to, lead, fourteen, nations, to, ratify, the, 1933, refugee, convention, an, early, and, relatively, modest, attempt, at, a, human, rights, charter, and, in, general, assisted, around, one, million, refugees, worldwide, the, rise, of, nazism, led, to, such, a, very, large, increase, in, the, number, of, refugees, from, germany, that, in, 1933, the, league, created, a, high, commission, for, refugees, coming, from, germany, besides, other, measures, by, the, nazis, which, created, fear, and, flight, jews, were, stripped, of, german, citizenship, by, the, reich, citizenship, law, of, 1935, on, 4, july, 1936, an, agreement, was, signed, under, league, auspices, that, defined, a, refugee, coming, from, germany, as, any, person, who, was, settled, in, that, country, who, does, not, possess, any, nationality, other, than, german, nationality, and, in, respect, of, whom, it, is, established, that, in, law, or, in, fact, he, or, she, does, not, enjoy, the, protection, of, the, government, of, the, reich, article, 1, the, mandate, of, the, high, commission, was, subsequently, expanded, to, include, persons, from, austria, and, sudetenland, which, germany, annexed, after, 1, october, 1938, in, accordance, with, the, munich, agreement, according, to, the, institute, for, refugee, assistance, the, actual, count, of, refugees, from, czechoslovakia, on, 1, march, 1939, stood, at, almost, 150, 000, between, 1933, and, 1939, about, 200, 000, jews, fleeing, nazism, were, able, to, find, refuge, in, france, while, at, least, 55, 000, jews, were, able, to, find, refuge, in, palestine, before, the, british, authorities, closed, that, destination, in, 1939, on, 31, december, 1938, both, the, nansen, office, and, high, commission, were, dissolved, and, replaced, by, the, office, of, the, high, commissioner, for, refugees, under, the, protection, of, the, league, this, coincided, with, the, flight, of, 500, 000, spanish, republicans, soldiers, as, well, as, civilians, to, france, after, their, defeat, by, the, nationalists, in, 1939, in, the, spanish, civil, war, the, conflict, and, political, instability, during,

based, definition, as, outlined, in, the, 1951, refugee, convention, is, disputed, additionally, academics, have, critiqued, the, lack, of, a, theoretical, basis, of, refugee, studies, and, dominance, of, policy, oriented, research, in, response, scholars, have, attempted, to, steer, the, field, toward, establishing, a, theoretical, groundwork, of, refugee, studies, through, situating, studies, of, particular, refugee, and, other, forced, migrant, groups, in, the, theories, of, cognate, areas, and, major, disciplines, an, opportunity, to, use, the, particular, circumstances, of, refugee, situations, to, illuminate, these, more, general, theories, and, thus, participate, in, the, development, of, social, science, rather, than, leading, refugee, studies, into, an, intellectual, cul, de, sac, thus, the, term, refugee, in, the, context, of, refugee, studies, can, be, referred, to, as, legal, or, descriptive, rubric, encompassing, socioeconomic, backgrounds, personal, histories, psychological, analyses, and, spiritualities, headquartered, in, geneva, switzerland, the, office, of, the, united, nations, high, commissioner, for, refugees, unhcr, was, established, on, 14, december, 1950, it, protects, and, supports, refugees, at, the, request, of, a, government, or, the, united, nations, and, assists, in, providing, durable, solutions, such, as, return, or, resettlement, all, refugees, in, the, world, are, under, unhcr, mandate, except, palestinian, refugees, who, fled, the, current, state, of, israel, between, 1947, and, 1949, as, a, result, of, the, 1948, arab, israeli, war, these, refugees, are, assisted, by, the, united, nations, relief, and, works, agency, unrwa, unhcr, also, provides, protection, and, assistance, to, other, categories, of, displaced, persons, asylum, seekers, refugees, who, returned, home, voluntarily, but, still, need, help, rebuilding, their, lives, local, civilian, communities, directly, affected, by, large, refugee, movements, stateless, people, and, so, called, internally, displaced, people, idps, as, well, as, people, in, refugee, like, and, idp, like, situations, the, agency, is, mandated, to, lead, and, co, ordinate, international, action, to, protect, refugees, and, to, resolve, refugee, problems, worldwide, its, primary, purpose, is, to, safeguard, the, rights, and, well, being, of, refugees, it, strives, to, ensure, that, everyone, can, exercise, the, right, to, seek, asylum, and, find, safe, refuge, in, another, state, or, territory, and, to, offer, durable, solutions, to, refugees, and, refugee, hosting, countries, unlike, other, refugee, groups, the, un, created, a, specific, entity, called, the, un, relief, and, works, agency, for, palestine, refugees, unrwa, in, the, aftermath, of, the, war, in, 1948, which, led, to, a, serious, refugee, crisis, in, the, arab, region, and, was, responsible, for, the, displacement, of, 700, 000, palestinian, refugees, this, number, has, gone, up, to, at, least, 5, million, refugees, in, the, last, 70, years, the, united, nations, defines, palestinian, refugees, as, persons, whose, normal, place, of, residence, was, palestine, during, the, period, 1, june, 1946, to, 15, may, 1948, and, who, lost, both, home, and, means, of, livelihood, as, a, result, of, the, 1948, conflict, the, population, of, palestinian, refugees, continues, to, grow, due, to, multiple, unrwa, reclassifications, of, what, is, considered, to, be, a, refugee, in, 1965, unrwa, changed, the, eligibility, requirements, to, be, a, palestinian, refugee, to, include, third, generation, descendants, and, in, 1982, it, extended, it, again, to, include, all, descendants, of, palestine, refugee, males, including, legally, adopted, children, regardless, of, whether, they, had, been, granted, citizenship, elsewhere, this, classification, process, is, inconsistent, with, how, all, other, refugees, in, the, world, are, classified, including, the, definition, used, by, the, united, nations, high, commissioner, for, refugees, unhcr, and, the, laws, concerning, refugees, in, the, united, states, another, refugee, wave, started, in, 1967, after, the, six, day, war, where, mostly, palestinians, living, in, gaza, and, the, west, bank, were, victims, of, displacement, according, to, the, united, nations, palestinian, refugees, struggle, with, access, to, health, care, food, clean, water, sanitation, environmental, health, and, infrastructure, education, and, technology, according, to, the, report, food, shelter, and, environmental, health, are, a, human, s, basic, needs, united, nations, agency, unrwa, the, united, nations, relief, and, works, agency, for, palestine, refugees, in, the, near, east, focuses, on, addressing, these, issues, to, relieve, palestinians, from, any, harm, unrwa, was, established, as, a, temporary, agency, that, would, carry, out, a, humanitarian, response, mandate, for, palestinian, refugees, in, gaza, the, west, bank, syria, jordan, and, lebanon, the, responsibilities, for, the, assistance, for, protection, for, palestinian, refugees, and, human, development, were, originally, left, to, the, united, nations, conciliation, commission, for, palestine, unccp, this, agency, failed, to, function, which, led, the, agency, to, stop, working, unrwa, took, over, these, responsibilities, and, expanded, their, mandate, from, just, humanitarian, emergency, relief, to, including, human, development, and, protection, of, the, palestinian, society, communication, with, host, countries, where, unrwa, is, operating, syria, jordan, and, lebanon, is, very, important, as, the, agency, s, mandate, changes, per, region, unrwa, s, medium, term, strategy, is, a, report, that, lists, all, the, issues, that, the, palestinians, are, facing, and, unrwa, s, plan, to, mitigate, the, severeness, of, the, issues, the, report, shows, that, unrwa, focusses, mostly, on, food, assistance, health, care, education, and, shelter, for, palestinian, refugees, unrwa, has, succeeded, in, placing, over, 700, schools, with, over, 500, 000, students, 140, health, centers, 113, women, community, centers, and, has, awarded, over, 475, 000, loans, unrwa, s, funding, relies, mostly, on, voluntary, donations, fluctuations, in, these, donations, result, in, constraints, in, carrying, out, the, mandate, a, refugee, camp, is, a, place, built, by, governments, or, ngos, such, as, the, red, cross, to, receive, refugees, internally, displaced, persons, or, sometimes, also, other, migrants, it, is, usually, designed, to, offer, acute, and, temporary, accommodation, and, services, and, any, more, permanent, facilities, and, structures, often, banned, people, may, stay, in, these, camps, for, many, years, receiving, emergency, food, education, and, medical, aid, until, it, is, safe, enough, to, return, to, their, country, of, origin, there, refugees, are, at, risk, of, disease, child, soldier, and, terrorist, recruitment, and, physical, and, sexual, violence, there, are, estimated, to, be, 700, refugee, camp, locations, worldwide, not, all, refugees, who, are, supported, by, the, unhcr, live, in, refugee, camps, a, significant, number, more, than, half, live, in, urban, settings, such, as, the, 60, 000, iraqi, refugees, in, damascus, syria, and, the, 30, 000, sudanese, refugees, in, cairo, egypt, the, residency, status, in, the, host, country, whilst, under, temporary, unhcr, protection, is, very, uncertain, as, refugees, are, only, granted, temporary, visas, that, have, to, be, regularly, renewed, rather, than, only, safeguarding, the, rights, and, basic, well, being, of, refugees, in, the, camps, or, in, urban, settings, on, a, temporary, basis, the, unhcr, s, ultimate, goal, is, to, find, one, of, the, three, durable, solutions, for, refugees, integration, repatriation, resettlement, local, integration, is, aiming, at, providing, the, refugee, with, the, permanent, right, to, stay, in, the, country, of, asylum, including, in, some, situations, as, a, naturalized, citizen, it, follows, the, formal, granting, of, refugee, status, by, the, country, of, asylum, it, is, difficult, to, quantify, the, number, of, refugees, who, settled, and, integrated, in, their, first, country, of, asylum, and, only, the, number, of, naturalisations, can, give, an, indication, in, 2014, tanzania, granted, citizenship, to, 162, 000, refugees, from, burundi, and, in, 1982, to, 32, 000, rwandan, refugees, mexico, naturalised, 6, 200, guatemalan, refugees, in, 2001, voluntary, return, of, refugees, into, their, country, of, origin, in, safety, and, dignity, is, based, on, their, free, will, and, their, informed, decision, in, the, last, couple, of, years, parts, of, or, even, whole, refugee, populations, were, able, to, return, to, their, home, countries, e, g, 120, 000, congolese, refugees, returned, from, the, republic, of, congo, to, the, drc, 30, 000, angolans, returned, home, from, the, drc, and, botswana, ivorian, refugees, returned, from, liberia, afghans, from, pakistan, and, iraqis, from, syria, in, 2013, the, governments, of, kenya, and, somalia, also, signed, a, tripartite, agreement, facilitating, the, repatriation, of, refugees, from, somalia, the, unhcr, and, the, iom, offer, assistance, to, refugees, who, want, to, return, voluntarily, to, their, home, countries, many, developed, countries, also, have, assisted, voluntary, return, avr, programmes, for, asylum, seekers, who, want, to, go, back, or, were, refused, asylum, third, country, resettlement, involves, the, assisted, transfer, of, refugees, from, the, country, in, which, they, have, sought, asylum, to, a, safe, third, country, that, has, agreed, to, admit, them, as, refugees, this, can, be, for, permanent, settlement, or, limited, to, a, certain, number, of, years, it, is, the, third, durable, solution, and, it, can, only, be, considered, once, the, two, other, solutions, have, proved, impossible, the, unhcr, has, traditionally, seen, resettlement, as, the, least, preferable, of, the, durable, solutions, to, refugee, situations, however, in, april, 2000, the, then, un, high, commissioner, for, refugees, sadako, ogata, stated, resettlement, can, no, longer, be, seen, as, the, least, preferred, durable, solution, in, many, cases, it, is, the, only, solution, for, refugees, unhcr, s, mandate, has, gradually, been, expanded, to, include, protecting, and, providing, humanitarian, assistance, to, internally, displaced, persons, idps, and, people, in, idp, like, situations, these, are, civilians, who, have, been, forced, to, flee, their, homes, but, who, have, not, reached, a, neighboring, country, idps, do, not, fit, the, legal, definition, of, a, refugee, under, the, 1951, refugee, convention, 1967, protocol, and, the, 1969, organization, for, african, unity, convention, because, they, have, not, left, their, country, as, the, nature, of, war, has, changed, in, the, last, few, decades, with, more, and, more, internal, conflicts, replacing, interstate, wars, the, number, of, idps, has, increased, significantly, in, the, united, states, the, term, refugee, is, defined, under, the, immigration, of, nationality, act, ina, in, other, countries, it, is, often, used, in, different, contexts, in, everyday, usage, it, refers, to, a, forcibly, displaced, person, who, has, fled, his, or, her, country, of, origin, in, a, more, specific, context, it, refers, to, such, a, person, who, was, on, top, of, that, granted, refugee, status, in, the, country, the, person, fled, to, even, more, exclusive, is, the, convention, refugee, status, which, is, given, only, to, persons, who, fall, within, the, refugee, definition, of, the, 1951, convention, and, the, 1967, protocol, to, receive, refugee, status, a, person, must, have, applied, for, asylum, making, them, while, waiting, for, a, decision, an, asylum, seeker, however, a, displaced, person, otherwise, legally, entitled, to, refugee, status, may, never, apply, for, asylum, or, may, not, be, allowed, to, apply, in, the, country, they, fled, to, and, thus, may, not, have, official, asylum, seeker, status, once, a, displaced, person, is, granted, refugee, status, they, enjoy, certain, rights, as, agreed, in, the, 1951, refugee, convention, not, all, countries, have, signed, and, ratified, this, convention, and, some, countries, do, not, have, a, legal, procedure, for, dealing, with, asylum, seekers, an, asylum, seeker, is, a, displaced, person, or, immigrant, who, has, formally, sought, the, protection, of, the, state, they, fled, to, as, well, as, the, right, to, remain, in, this, country, and, who, is, waiting, for, a, decision, on, this, formal, application, an, asylum, seeker, may, have, applied, for, convention, refugee, status, or, for, complementary, forms, of, protection, asylum, is, thus, a, category, that, includes, different, forms, of, protection, which, form, of, protection, is, offered, depends, on, the, legal, definition, that, best, describes, the, asylum, seeker, s, reasons, to, flee, once, the, decision, was, made, the, asylum, seeker, receives, either, convention, refugee, status, or, a, complementary, form, of, protection, and, can, stay, in, the, country, or, is, refused, asylum, and, then, often, has, to, leave, only, after, the, state, territory, or, the, unhcr, wherever, the, application, was, made, recognises, the, protection, needs, does, the, asylum, seeker, officially, receive, refugee, status, this, carries, certain, rights, and, obligations, according, to, the, legislation, of, the, receiving, country, quota, refugees, do, not, need, to, apply, for, asylum, on, arrival, in, the, third, countries, as, they, already, went, through, the, unhcr, refugee, status, determination, process, whilst, being, in, the, first, country, of, asylum, and, this, is, usually, accepted, by, the, third, countries, to, receive, refugee, status, a, displaced, person, must, go, through, a, refugee, status, determination, rsd, process, which, is, conducted, by, the, government, of, the, country, of, asylum, or, the, unhcr, and, is, based, on, international, regional, or, national, law, rsd, can, be, done, on, a, case, by, case, basis, as, well, as, for, whole, groups, of, people, which, of, the, two, processes, is, used, often, depends, on, the, size, of, the, influx, of, displaced, persons, there, is, no, specific, method, mandated, for, rsd, apart, from, the, commitment, to, the, 1951, refugee, convention, and, it, is, subject, to, the, overall, efficacy, of, the, country, s, internal, administrative, and, judicial, system, as, well, as, the, characteristics, of, the, refugee, flow, to, which, the, country, responds, this, lack, of, a, procedural, direction, could, create, a, situation, where, political, and, strategic, interests, override, humanitarian, considerations, in, the, rsd, process, there, are, also, no, fixed, interpretations, of, the, elements, in, the, 1951, refugee, convention, and, countries, may, interpret, them, differently, see, also, refugee, roulette, however, in, 2013, the, unhcr, conducted, them, in, more, than, 50, countries, and, co, conducted, them, parallel, to, or, jointly, with, governments, in, another, 20, countries, which, made, it, the, second, largest, rsd, body, in, the, world, the, unhcr, follows, a, set, of, guidelines, described, in, the, handbook, and, guidelines, on, procedures, and, criteria, for, determining, refugee, status, to, determine, which, individuals, are, eligible, for, refugee, status, refugee, rights, encompass, both, customary, law, peremptory, norms, and, international, legal, instruments, if, the, entity, granting, refugee, status, is, a, state, that, has, signed, the, 1951, refugee, convention, then, the, refugee, has, the, right, to, employment, further, rights, include, the, following, rights, and, obligations, for, refugees, even, in, a, supposedly, post, conflict, environment, it, is, not, a, simple, process, for, refugees, to, return, home, the, un, pinheiro, principles, are, guided, by, the, idea, that, people, not, only, have, the, right, to, return, home, but, also, the, right, to, the, same, property, it, seeks, to, return, to, the, pre, conflict, status, quo, and, ensure, that, no, one, profits, from, violence, yet, this, is, a, very, complex, issue, and, every, situation, is, different, conflict, is, a, highly, transformative, force, and, the, pre, war, status, quo, can, never, be, reestablished, completely, even, if, that, were, desirable, it, may, have, caused, the, conflict, in, the, first, place, therefore, the, following, are, of, particular, importance, to, the, right, to, return, refugees, who, were, resettled, to, a, third, country, will, likely, lose, the, indefinite, leave, to, remain, in, this, country, if, they, return, to, their, country, of, origin, or, the, country, of, first, asylum, non, refoulement, is, the, right, not, to, be, returned, to, a, place, of, persecution, and, is, the, foundation, for, international, refugee, law, as, outlined, in, the, 1951, convention, relating, to, the, status, of, refugees, the, right, to, non, refoulement, is, distinct, from, the, right, to, asylum, to, respect, the, right, to, asylum, states, must, not, deport, genuine, refugees, in, contrast, the, right, to, non, refoulement, allows, states, to, transfer, genuine, refugees, to, third, party, countries, with, respectable, human, rights, records, the, portable, procedural, model, proposed, by, political, philosopher, andy, lamey, emphasizes, the, right, to, non, refoulement, by, guaranteeing, refugees, three, procedural, rights, to, a, verbal, hearing, to, legal, counsel, and, to, judicial, review, of, detention, decisions, and, ensuring, those, rights, in, the, constitution, this, proposal, attempts, to, strike, a, balance, between, the, interest, of, national, governments, and, the, interests, of, refugees, family, reunification, which, can, also, be, a, form, of, resettlement, is, a, recognized, reason, for, immigration, in, many, countries, divided, families, have, the, right, to, be, reunited, if, a, family, member, with, permanent, right, of, residency, applies, for, the, reunification, and, can, prove, the, people, on, the, application, were, a, family, unit, before, arrival, and, wish, to, live, as, a, family, unit, since, separation, if, application, is, successful, this, enables, the, rest, of, the, family, to, immigrate, to, that, country, as, well, those, states, that, signed, the, convention, relating, to, the, status, of, refugees, are, obliged, to, issue, travel, documents, i, e, convention, travel,

origin, i, e, from, where, the, refugee, fled, once, refugees, or, asylum, seekers, have, found, a, safe, place, and, protection, of, a, state, or, territory, outside, their, territory, of, origin,

for, most, refugees, two, thirds, of, all, refugees, around, the, world, have, been, displaced, for, over, three, years, which, is, known, as, being, in, protracted, displacement, 50, of, refugees, around, 10, million, people, have, been, displaced, for, over, ten, years, protracted, displacement, can, lead, to, detrimental, effects, on, refugee, employment, and, refugee, workforce, integration, exacerbating, the, effect, of, the, canvas, ceiling, protracted, displacement, leads, to, skills, to, atrophy, leading, qualifications, and, experiences, to, be, outdated, and, incompatible, to, the, changing, working, environments, of, receiving, countries, by, the, time, refugees, resettle, the, overseas, development, institute, has, found, that, aid, programmes, need, to, move, from, short, term, models, of, assistance, such, as, food, or, cash, handouts, to, more, sustainable, long, term, programmes, that, help, refugees, become, more, self, reliant, this, can, involve, tackling, difficult, legal, and, economic, environments, by, improving, social, services, job, opportunities, and, laws, refugees, typically, report, poorer, levels, of, health, compared, to, other, immigrants, and, the, non, immigrant, population, apart, from, physical, wounds, or, starvation, a, large, percentage, of, refugees, develop, symptoms, of, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, ptsd, and, show, post, traumatic, stress, symptoms, ptss, or, depression, these, long, term, mental, problems, can, severely, impede, the, functionality, of, the, person, in, everyday, situations, it, makes, matters, even, worse, for, displaced, persons, who, are, confronted, with, a, new, environment, and, challenging, situations, they, are, also, at, high, risk, for, suicide, among, other, symptoms, post,

12, to, 16, years, from, governmental, private, and, united, nations, relief, work, agency, unrwa, schools, in, east, jerusalem, and, various, governorates, in, the, west, bank, another, study, showed, that, 28, 3, of, bosnian, refugee, women, had, symptoms, of, ptsd, three, or, four, years, after, their, arrival, in, sweden, these, women, also, had, significantly, higher, risks, of, symptoms, of, depression, anxiety, and, psychological, distress, than, swedish, born, women, for, depression, the, odds, ratio, was, 9, 50, among, bosnian, women, a, study, by, the, department, of, pediatrics, and, emergency, medicine, at, the, boston, university, school, of, medicine, demonstrated, that, twenty, percent, of, sudanese, refugee, minors, living, in, the, united, states, had, a, diagnosis, of, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, they, were, also, more, likely, to, have, worse, scores, on, all, the, child, health, questionnaire, subscales, in, a, study, for, the, united, kingdom, refugees, were, found, to, be, 4, percentage, points, more, likely, to, report, a, mental, health, problem, compared, to, the, non, immigrant, population, this, contrasts, with, the, results, for, other, immigrant, groups, which, were, less, likely, to, report, a, mental, health, problem, compared, to, the, non, immigrant, population, many, more, studies, illustrate, the, problem, one, meta, study, was, conducted, by, the, psychiatry, department, of, oxford, university, at, warneford, hospital, in, the, united, kingdom, twenty, surveys, were, analyzed, providing, results, for, 6, 743, adult, refugees, from, seven, countries, in, the, larger, studies, 9, were, diagnosed, with, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, and, 5, with, major, depression, with, evidence, of, much, psychiatric, co, morbidity, five, surveys, of, 260, refugee, children, from, three, countries, yielded, a, prevalence, of, 11, for, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, according, to, this, study, refugees, resettled, in, western, countries, could, be, about, ten, times, more, likely, to, have, ptsd, than, age, matched, general, populations, in, those, countries, worldwide, tens, of, thousands, of, refugees, and, former, refugees, resettled, in, western, countries, probably, have, post, traumatic, stress, disorder, refugees, are, often, more, susceptible, to, illness, for, several, reasons, including, a, lack, of, immunity, to, local, strains, of, malaria, and, other, diseases, displacement, of, a, people, can, create, favorable, conditions, for, disease, transmission, refugee, camps, are, typically, heavily, populated, with, poor, sanitary, conditions, the, removal, of, vegetation, for, space, building, materials, or, firewood, also, deprives, mosquitoes, of, their, natural, habitats, leading, them, to, more, closely, interact, with, humans, in, the, 1970s, afghanese, refugees, that, were, relocated, to, pakistan, were, going, from, a, country, with, an, effective, malaria, control, strategy, to, a, country, with, a, less, effective, system, the, refugee, camps, were, built, near, rivers, or, irrigation, sites, had, higher, malaria, prevalence, than, refugee, camps, built, on, dry, lands, the, location, of, the, camps, lent, themselves, to, better, breeding, grounds, for, mosquitoes, and, thus, a, higher, likelihood, of, malaria, transmission, children, aged, 1, 15, were, the, most, susceptible, to, malaria, infection, which, is, a, significant, cause, of, mortality, in, children, younger, than, 5, malaria, was, the, cause, of, 16, of, the, deaths, in, refugee, children, younger, than, 5, years, of, age, malaria, is, one, of, the, most, commonly, reported, causes, of, death, in, refugees, and, displaced, persons, since, 2014, reports, of,

people, in, areas, that, are, endemic, for, malaria, use, long, lasting, insecticide, nets, a, cohort, study, found, that, within, refugee, camps, in, pakistan, insecticide, treated, bed, nets, were, very, useful, in, reducing, malaria, cases, a, single, treatment, of, the, nets, with, the, insecticide, permethrin, remained, protective, throughout, the, 6, month, transmission, season, access, to, services, depends, on, many, factors, including, whether, a, refugee, has, received, official, status, is, situated, within, a, refugee, camp, or, is, in, the, process, of, third, country, resettlement, the, unhcr, recommends, integrating, access, to, primary, care, and, emergency, health, services, with, the, host, country, in, as, equitable, a, manner, as, possible, prioritized, services, include, areas, of, maternal, and, child, health, immunizations, tuberculosis, screening, and, treatment, and, hiv, aids, related, services, despite, inclusive, stated, policies, for, refugee, access, to, health, care, on, the, international, levels, potential, barriers, to, that, access, include, language, cultural, preferences, high, financial, costs, administrative, hurdles, and, physical, distance, specific, barriers, and, policies, related, to, health, service, access, also, emerge, based, on, the, host, country, context, for, example, primaquine, an, often, recommended, malaria, treatment, is, not, currently, licensed, for, use, in, germany, and, must, be, ordered, from, outside, the, country, in, canada, barriers, to, healthcare, access, include, the, lack, of, adequately, trained, physicians, complex, medical, conditions, of, some, refugees, and, the, bureaucracy, of, medical, coverage, there, are, also, individual, barriers, to, access, such, as, language, and, transportation, barriers, institutional, barriers, such, as, bureaucratic, burdens, and, lack, of, entitlement, knowledge, and, systems, level, barriers, such, as, conflicting, policies, racism, and, physician, workforce, shortage, in, the, us, all, officially, designated, iraqi, refugees, had, health, insurance, coverage, compared, to, a, little, more, than, half, of, non, iraqi, immigrants, in, a, dearborn, michigan, study, however, greater, barriers, existed, around, transportation, language, and, successful, stress, coping, mechanisms, for, refugees, versus, other, immigrants, in, addition, refugees, noted, greater, medical, conditions, the, study, also, found, that, refugees, had, higher, healthcare, utilization, rate, 92, 1, as, compared, to, the, us, overall, population, 84, 8, and, immigrants, 58, 6, in, the, study, population, within, australia, officially, designated, refugees, who, qualify, for, temporary, protection, and, offshore, humanitarian, refugees, are, eligible, for, health, assessments, interventions, and, access, to, health, insurance, schemes, and, trauma, related, counseling, services, despite, being, eligible, to, access, services, barriers, include, economic, constraints, around, perceived, and, actual, costs, carried, by, refugees, in, addition, refugees, must, cope, with, a, healthcare, workforce, unaware, of, the, unique, health, needs, of, refugee, populations, perceived, legal, barriers, such, as, fear, that, disclosing, medical, conditions, prohibiting, reunification, of, family, members, and, current, policies, which, reduce, assistance, programs, may, also, limit, access, to, health, care, services, providing, access, to, healthcare, for, refugees, through, integration, into, the, current, health, systems, of, host, countries, may, also, be, difficult, when, operating, in, a, resource, limited, setting, in, this, context, barriers, to, healthcare, access, may, include, political, aversion, in, the, host, country, and, already, strained, capacity, of, the, existing, health, system, political, aversion, to, refugee, access, into, the, existing, health, system, may, stem, from, the, wider, issue, of, refugee, resettlement, one, approach, to, limiting, such, barriers, is, to, move, from, a, parallel, administrative, system, in, which, unhcr, refugees, may, receive, better, healthcare, than, host, nationals, but, is, unsustainable, financially, and, politically, to, that, of, an, integrated, care, where, refugee, and, host, nationals, receive, equal, and, more, improved, care, all, around, in, the, 1980s, pakistan, attempted, to, address, afghan, refugee, healthcare, access, through, the, creation, of, basic, health, units, inside, the, camps, funding, cuts, closed, many, of, these, programs, forcing, refugees, to, seek, healthcare, from, the, local, government, in, response, to, a, protracted, refugee, situation, in, the, west, nile, district, ugandan, officials, with, unhcr, created, an, integrative, healthcare, model, for, the, mostly, sudanese, refugee, population, and, ugandan, citizens, local, nationals, now, access, health, care, in, facilities, initially, created, for, refugees, one, potential, argument, for, limiting, refugee, access, to, healthcare, is, associated, with, costs, with, states, desire, to, decrease, health, expenditure, burdens, however, germany, found, that, restricting, refugee, access, led, to, an, increase, actual, expenditures, relative, to, refugees, which, had, full, access, to, healthcare, services, the, legal, restrictions, on, access, to, health, care, and, the, administrative, barriers, in, germany, have, been, criticized, since, the, 1990s, for, leading, to, delayed, care, for, increasing, direct, costs, and, administrative, costs, of, health, care, and, for, shifting, the, responsibility, for, care, from, the, less, expensive, primary, care, sector, to, costly, treatments, for, acute, conditions, in, the, secondary, and, tertiary, sector, refugee, populations, consist, of, people, who, are, terrified, and, are, away, from, familiar, surroundings, there, can, be, instances, of, exploitation, at, the, hands, of, enforcement, officials, citizens, of, the, host, country, and, even, united, nations, peacekeepers, instances, of, human, rights, violations, child, labor, mental, and, physical, trauma, torture, violence, related, trauma, and, sexual, exploitation, especially, of, children, have, been, documented, in, many, refugee, camps, in, three, war, torn, west, african, countries, sierra, leone, guinea, and, liberia, young, girls, were, found, to, be, exchanging, sex, for, money, a, handful, of, fruit, or, even, a, bar, of, soap, most, of, these, girls, were, between, 13, and, 18, years, of, age, in, most, cases, if, the, girls, had, been, forced, to, stay, they, would, have, been, forced, into, marriage, they, became, pregnant, around, the, age, of, 15, on, average, this, happened, as, recently, as, in, 2001, parents, tended, to, turn, a, blind, eye, because, sexual, exploitation, had, become, a, mechanism, of, survival, in, these, camps, large, groups, of, displaced, persons, could, be, abused, as, weapons, to, threaten, political, enemies, or, neighbouring, countries, it, is, for, this, reason, amongst, others, that, the, united, nations, sustainable, development, goal, 10, aims, to, facilitate, orderly, safe, regular, and, responsible, mobility, of, people, through, planned, and, well, managed, migration, policies, concerns, about, human, trafficking, and, sexual, violence, have, been, realized, during, the, 2022, present, ukrainian, refugee, crisis, european, commissioner, for, home, affairs, ylva, johansson, said, we, have, some, indications, on, online, services, that, the, demand, for, ukrainian, women, for, sexual, purposes, has, gone, up, according, to, usa, today, there, has, been, a, skyrocketing, increase, in, all, forms, of, illegal, trafficking, of, women, and, girls, in, the, region, and, also, boys, including, forced, sex, and, labor, prostitution, pornography, and, other, forms, of, sexual, exploitation, in, recent, weeks, online, searches, for, ukrainian, women, and, keywords, like, escorts, porn, or, sex, have, shot, up, dramatically, in, european, countries, according, to, the, organization, for, security, and, co, operation, in, europe, osce, little, empirical, evidence, supports, concerns, that, refugees, commit, crimes, at, higher, rates, than, natives, and, some, evidence, suggests, they, may, even, commit, crime, at, lower, rates, than, natives, very, rarely, refugees, have, been, used, and, recruited, as, refugee, militants, or, terrorists, and, the, humanitarian, aid, directed, at, refugee, relief, has, very, rarely, been, utilized, to, fund, the, acquisition, of, arms, although, conclusions, from, case, studies, of, refugee, mobilizations, raised, concerns, that, humanitarian, aid, may, support, rebel, groups, more, recent, empirical, evidence, does, not, support, the, generalizability, of, these, concerns, support, from, a, refugee, receiving, state, has, rarely, been, used, to, enable, refugees, to, mobilize, militarily, enabling, conflict, to, spread, across, borders, historically, refugee, populations, have, often, been, portrayed, as, a, security, threat, in, the, u, s, and, europe, there, has, been, much, focus, on, the, narrative, that, terrorists, maintain, networks, amongst, transnational, refugee, and, migrant, populations, this, fear, has, been, exaggerated, into, a, modern, day, islamist, terrorism, trojan, horse, in, which, terrorists, hide, among, refugees, and, penetrate, host, countries, muslim, refugee, as, an, enemy, within, rhetoric, is, relatively, new, but, the, underlying, scapegoating, of, out, groups, for, domestic, societal, problems, fears, and, ethno, nationalist, sentiment, is, not, new, in, the, 1890s, the, influx, of, eastern, european, jewish, refugees, to, london, coupled, with, the, rise, of, anarchism, in, the, city, led, to, a, confluence, of, threat, perception, and, fear, of, the, refugee, out, group, populist, rhetoric, then, too, propelled, debate, over, migration, control, and, protecting, national, security, cross, national, empirical, verification, or, rejection, of, populist, suspicion, and, fear, of, refugees, threat, to, national, security, and, terror, related, activities, is, relatively, scarce, case, studies, suggest, that, the, threat, of, an, islamist, refugee, trojan, house, is, highly, exaggerated, of, the, 800, 000, refugees, vetted, through, the, resettlement, program, in, the, united, states, between, 2001, and, 2016, only, five, were, subsequently, arrested, on, terrorism, charges, and, 17, of, the, 600, 000, iraqis, and, syrians, who, arrived, in, germany, in, 2015, were, investigated, for, terrorism, one, study, found, that, european, jihadists, tend, to, be, homegrown, over, 90, were, residents, of, a, european, country, and, 60, had, european, citizenship, while, the, statistics, do, not, support, the, rhetoric, a, pew, research, center, survey, of, ten, european, countries, hungary, poland, netherlands, germany, italy, sweden, greece, uk, france, and, spain, released, on, 11, july, 2016, finds, that, the, majority, ranges, from, 52, to, 76, of, respondents, in, eight, countries, hungary, poland, netherlands, germany, italy, sweden, greece, and, uk, think, refugees, increase, the, likelihood, of, terrorism, in, their, country, since, 1975, in, the, u, s, the, risk, of, dying, in, a, terror, attack, by, a, refugee, is, 1, in, 3, 6, billion, per, year, whereas, the, odds, of, dying, in, a, motor, vehicle, crash, are, 1, in, 113, by, state, sanctioned, execution, 1, in, 111, 439, or, by, dog, attack, 1, in, 114, 622, in, europe, fear, of, immigration, islamification, and, job, and, welfare, benefits, competition, has, fueled, an, increase, in, violence, immigrants, are, perceived, as, a, threat, to, ethno, nationalist, identity, and, increase, concerns, over, criminality, and, insecurity, in, the, pew, survey, previously, referenced, 50, of, respondents, believe, that, refugees, are, a, burden, due, to, job, and, social, benefit, competition, when, sweden, received, over, 160, 000, asylum, seekers, in, 2015, it, was, accompanied, by, 50, attacks, against, asylum, seekers, which, was, more, than, four, times, the, number, of, attacks, that, occurred, in, the, previous, four, years, at, the, incident, level, the, 2011, ut, ya, norway, terror, attack, by, breivik, demonstrates, the, impact, of, this, threat, perception, on, a, country, s, risk, from, domestic, terrorism, in, particular, ethno, nationalist, extremism, breivik, portrayed, himself, as, a, protector, of, norwegian, ethnic, identity, and, national, security, fighting, against, immigrant, criminality, competition, and, welfare, abuse, and, an, islamic, takeover, contrary, to, popular, concerns, that, refugees, cause, crime, a, more, empirically, grounded, concern, is, that, refugees, are, at, high, risk, of, being, targets, of, anti, refugee, violence, according, to, a, 2018, study, in, the, journal, of, peace, research, states, often, resort, to, anti, refugee, violence, in, response, to, terrorist, attacks, or, security, crises, the, study, notes, that, there, is, evidence, to, suggest, that, the, repression, of, refugees, is, more, consistent, with, a, scapegoating, mechanism, than, the, actual, ties, and, involvement, of, refugees, in, terrorism, in, 2018, us, president, donald, trump, made, some, comments, about, refugees, and, immigrants, in, sweden, he, stated, that, the, high, numbers, of, crimes, are, because, of, refugees, and, immigrants, the, category, of, refugee, tends, to, have, a, universalizing, effect, on, those, classified, as, such, it, draws, upon, the, common, humanity, of, a, mass, of, people, in, order, to, inspire, public, empathy, but, doing, so, can, have, the, unintended, consequence, of, silencing, refugee, stories, and, erasing, the, political, and, historical, factors, that, led, to, their, present, state, humanitarian, groups, and, media, outlets, often, rely, on, images, of, refugees, that, evoke, emotional, responses, and, are, said, to, speak, for, themselves, the, refugees, in, these, images, however, are, not, asked, to, elaborate, on, their, experiences, and, thus, their, narratives, are, all, but, erased, from, the, perspective, of, the, international, community, refugee, is, a, performative, status, equated, with, injury, ill, health, and, poverty, when, people, no, longer, display, these, traits, they, are, no, longer, seen, as, ideal, refugees, even, if, they, still, fit, the, legal, definition, for, this, reason, there, is, a, need, to, improve, current, humanitarian, efforts, by, acknowledging, the, narrative, authority, historical, agency, and, political, memory, of, refugees, alongside, their, shared, humanity, dehistorizing, and, depoliticizing, refugees, can, have, dire, consequences, rwandan, refugees, in, tanzanian, camps, for, example, were, pressured, to, return, to, their, home, country, before, they, believed, it, was, truly, safe, to, do, so, despite, the, fact, that, refugees, drawing, on, their, political, history, and, experiences, claimed, that, tutsi, forces, still, posed, a, threat, to, them, in, rwanda, their, narrative, was, overshadowed, by, the, u, n, assurances, of, safety, when, the, refugees, did, return, home, reports, of, reprisals, against, them, land, seizures, disappearances, and, incarceration, abounded, as, they, had, feared, integrating, refugees, into, the, workforce, is, one, of, the, most, important, steps, to, overall, integration, of, this, particular, migrant, group, many, refugees, are, unemployed, under, employed, under, paid, and, work, in, the, informal, economy, if, not, receiving, public, assistance, refugees, encounter, many, barriers, in, receiving, countries, in, finding, and, sustaining, employment, commensurate, with, their, experience, and, expertise, a, systemic, barrier, that, is, situated, across, multiple, levels, i, e, institutional, organizational, and, individual, levels, is, coined, canvas, ceiling, refugee, children, come, from, many, different, backgrounds, and, their, reasons, for, resettlement, are, even, more, diverse, the, number, of, refugee, children, has, continued, to, increase, as, conflicts, interrupt, communities, at, a, global, scale, in, 2014, alone, there, were, approximately, 32, armed, conflicts, in, 26, countries, around, the, world, and, this, period, saw, the, highest, number, of, refugees, ever, recorded, refugee, children, experience, traumatic, events, in, their, lives, that, can, affect, their, learning, capabilities, even, after, they, have, resettled, in, first, or, second, settlement, countries, educators, such, as, teachers, counselors, and, school, staff, along, with, the, school, environment, are, key, in, facilitating, socialization, and, acculturation, of, recently, arrived, refugee, and, immigrant, children, in, their, new, schools, the, experiences, children, go, through, during, times, of, armed, conflict, can, impede, their, ability, to, learn, in, an, educational, setting, schools, experience, drop, outs, of, refugee, and, immigrant, students, from, an, array, of, factors, such, as, rejection, by, peers, low, self, esteem, antisocial, behavior, negative, perceptions, of, their, academic, ability, and, lack, of, support, from, school, staff, and, parents, because, refugees, come, from, various, regions, globally, with, their, own, cultural, religious, linguistic, and, home, practices, the, new, school, culture, can, conflict, with, the, home, culture, causing, tension, between, the, student, and, their, family, aside, from, students, teachers, and, school, staff, also, face, their, own, obstacles, in, working, with, refugee, students, they, have, concerns, about, their, ability, to, meet, the, mental, physical, emotional, and, educational, needs, of, students, one, study, of, newly, arrived, bantu, students, from, somalia, in, a, chicago, school, questioned, whether, schools, were, equipped, to, provide, them, with, a, quality, education, that, met, the, needs, of, the, pupils, the, students, were, not, aware, of, how, to, use, pencils, which, caused, them, to, break, the, tips, requiring, frequent, sharpening, teachers, may, even, see, refugee, students, as, different, from, other, immigrant, groups, as, was, the, case, with, the, bantu, pupils, teachers, may, sometimes, feel, that, their, work, is, made, harder, because, of, the, pressures, to, meet, state, requirements, for, testing, with, refugee, children, falling, behind, or, struggling, to, catch, up, it, can, overwhelm, teachers, and, administrators, further, leading, to, anger, not, all, students, adjust, the, same, way, to, their, new, setting, one, student, may, take, only, three, months, while, others, may, take, four, years, one, study, found, that, even, in, their, fourth, year, of, schooling, lao, and, vietnamese, refugee, students, in, the, us, were, still, in, a, transitional, status, refugee, students, continue, to, encounter, difficulties, throughout, their, years, in, schools, that, can, hinder, their, ability, to, learn, furthermore, to, provide, proper, support, educators, must, consider, the, experiences, of, students, before, they, settled, the, us, in, their, first, settlement, countries, refugee, students, may, encounter, negative, experiences, with, education, that, they, can, carry, with, them, post, settlement, for, example, statistics, found, that, in, places, such, as, uganda, and, kenya, there, were, gaps, in, refugee, students, attending, schools, it, found, that, 80, of, refugees, in, uganda, were, attending, schools, whereas, only, 46, of, students, were, attending, schools, in, kenya, furthermore, for, secondary, levels, the, numbers, were, much, lower, there, was, only, 1, 4, of, refugee, students, attending, schools, in, malaysia, this, trend, is, evident, across, several, first, settlement, countries, and, carry, negative, impacts, on, students, once, they, arrive, to, their, permanent, settlement, homes, such, as, the, us, and, have, to, navigate, a, new, education, system, some, refugees, do, not, have, a, chance, to, attend, schools, in, their, first, settlement, countries, because, they, are, considered, undocumented, immigrants, in, places, like, malaysia, for, rohingya, refugees, in, other, cases, such, as, burundians, in, tanzania, refugees, can, get, more, access, to, education, while, in, displacement, than, in, their, home, countries, all, students, need, some, form, of, support, to, help, them, overcome, obstacles, and, challenges, they, may, face, in, their, lives, especially, refugee, children, who, may, experience, frequent, disruptions, there, are, a, few, ways, in, which, schools, can, help, refugee, students, overcome, obstacles, to, attain, success, in, their, new, homes, one, school, in, nyc, has, found, a, method, that, works, for, them, to, help, refugee, students, succeed, this, school, creates, support, for, language, and, literacies, which, promotes, students, using, english, and, their, native, languages, to, complete, projects, furthermore, they, have, a, learning, centered, pedagogy, which, promotes, the, idea, that, there, are, multiple, entry, points, to, engage, the, students, in, learning, both, strategies, have, helped, refugee, students, succeed, during, their, transition, into, us, schools, various, websites, contain, resources, that, can, help, school, staff, better, learn, to, work, with, refugee, students, such, as, bridging, refugee, youth, and, children, s, services, archived, 22, september, 2018, at, the, wayback, machine, with, the, support, of, educators, and, the, school, community, education, can, help, rebuild, the, academic, social, and, emotional, well, being, of, refugee, students, who, have, suffered, from, past, and, present, trauma, marginalization, and, social, alienation, it, is, important, to, understand, the, cultural, differences, amongst, newly, arrived, refugees, and, school, culture, such, as, that, of, the, u, s, this, can, be, seen, as, problematic, because, of, the, frequent, disruptions, that, it, can, create, in, a, classroom, setting, in, addition, because, of, the, differences, in, language, and, culture, students, are, often, placed, in, lower, classes, due, to, their, lack, of, english, proficiency, students, can, also, be, made, to, repeat, classes, because, of, their, lack, of, english, proficiency, even, if, they, have, mastered, the, content, of, the, class, when, schools, have, the, resources, and, are, able, to, provide, separate, classes, for, refugee, students, to, develop, their, english, skills, it, can, take, the, average, refugee, students, only, three, months, to, catch, up, with, their, peers, this, was, the, case, with, somali, refugees, at, some, primary, schools, in, nairobi, the, histories, of, refugee, students, are, often, hidden, from, educators, resulting, in, cultural, misunderstandings, however, when, teachers, school, staff, and, peers, help, refugee, students, develop, a, positive, cultural, identity, it, can, help, buffer, the, negative, effects, refugees, experiences, have, on, them, such, as, poor, academic, performance, isolation, and, discrimination, refugee, crisis, can, refer, to, movements, of, large, groups, of, displaced, persons, who, could, be, either, internally, displaced, persons, refugees, or, other, migrants, it, can, also, refer, to, incidents, in, the, country, of, origin, or, departure, to, large, problems, whilst, on, the, move, or, even, after,
