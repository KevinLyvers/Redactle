chance, of, returning, as, a, major, language, however, josef, jungmann, and, other, revivalists, used, dobrovsk, s, book, to, advocate, for, a, czech, linguistic, revival, changes, during, this, time, included, spelling, reform, notably, in, place, of, the, former, j, and, j, in, place, of, g, the, use, of, t, rather, than, ti, to, end, infinitive, verbs, and, the, non, capitalization, of, nouns, which, had, been, a, late, borrowing, from, german, these, changes, differentiated, czech, from, slovak, modern, scholars, disagree, about, whether, the, conservative, revivalists, were, motivated, by, nationalism, or, considered, contemporary, spoken, czech, unsuitable, for, formal, widespread, use, adherence, to, historical, patterns, was, later, relaxed, and, standard, czech, adopted, a, number, of, features, from, common, czech, a, widespread, informally, used, interdialectal, variety, such, as, leaving, some, proper, nouns, undeclined, this, has, resulted, in, a, relatively, high, level, of, homogeneity, among, all, varieties, of, the, language, czech, is, spoken, by, about, 10, million, residents, of, the, czech, republic, a, eurobarometer, survey, conducted,

represented, by, the, letter, capital, is, very, rare, among, languages, and, often, claimed, to, be, unique, to, czech, though, it, also, occurs, in, some, dialects, of, kashubian, and, formerly, occurred, in, polish, it, represents, the, raised, alveolar, non, sonorant, trill, ipa, a, sound, somewhere, between, czech, r, and, example, eka, river, and, is, present, in, dvo, k, in, unvoiced,

of, a, vowel, str, prst, skrz, krk, stick, finger, through, throat, is, a, well, known, czech, tongue, twister, using, syllabic, consonants, but, no, vowels, each, word, has, primary, stress, on, its, first, syllable, except, for, enclitics, minor, monosyllabic, unstressed, syllables, in, all, words, of, more, than, two, syllables, every, odd, numbered, syllable, receives, secondary, stress,

noun, is, preceded, by, a, monosyllabic, preposition, the, stress, usually, moves, to, the, preposition, e, g, do, prahy, to, prague, czech, grammar, like, that, of, other, slavic, languages, is, fusional, its, nouns, verbs, and, adjectives, are, inflected, by, phonological, processes, to, modify, their, meanings, and, grammatical, functions, and, the, easily, separable, affixes, characteristic, of, agglutinative, languages, are, limited, czech, inflects, for, case, gender, and, number, in, nouns, and, tense, aspect, mood, person, and, subject, number, and, gender, in, verbs, parts, of, speech, include, adjectives, adverbs, numbers, interrogative, words, prepositions, conjunctions, and, interjections, adverbs, are, primarily, formed, from, adjectives, by, taking, the, final, or, of, the, base, form, and, replacing, it, with, e, y, or, o, negative, statements, are, formed, by, adding, the, affix, ne, to, the, main, verb, of, a, clause, with, one, exception, je, he, she, or, it, is, becomes, nen, because, czech, uses, grammatical, case, to, convey, word, function, in, a, sentence, instead, of, relying, on, word, order, as, english, does, its, word, order, is, flexible, as, a, pro, drop, language, in, czech, an, intransitive, sentence, can, consist, of, only, a, verb, information, about, its, subject, is, encoded, in, the, verb, enclitics, primarily, auxiliary, verbs, and, pronouns, appear, in, the, second, syntactic, slot, of, a, sentence, after, the, first, stressed, unit, the, first, slot, can, contain, a, subject, or, object, a, main, form, of, a, verb, an, adverb, or, a, conjunction, except, for, the, light, conjunctions, a, and, i, and, even, or, ale, but, czech, syntax, has, a, subject, verb, object, sentence, structure, in, practice, however, word, order, is, flexible, and, used, to, distinguish, topic, and, focus, with, the, topic, or, theme, known, referents, preceding, the, focus, or, rheme, new, information, in, a, sentence, czech, has, therefore, been, described, as, a, topic, prominent, language, although, czech, has, a, periphrastic, passive, construction, like, english, in, colloquial, style, word, order, changes, frequently, replace, the, passive, voice, for, example, to, change, peter, killed, paul, to, paul, was, killed, by, peter, the, order, of, subject, and, object, is, inverted, petr, zabil, pavla, peter, killed, paul, becomes, paul, peter, killed, pavla, zabil, petr, pavla, is, in, the, accusative, case, the, grammatical, object, of, the, verb, a, word, at, the, end, of, a, clause, is, typically, emphasized, unless, an, upward, intonation, indicates, that, the, sentence, is, a, question, in, parts, of, bohemia, including, prague, questions, such, as, j, pes, bagetu, without, an, interrogative, word, such, as, co, what, or, kdo, who, are, intoned, in, a, slow, rise, from, low, to, high, quickly, dropping, to, low, on, the, last, word, or, phrase, in, modern, czech, syntax, adjectives, precede, nouns, with, few, exceptions, relative, clauses, are, introduced, by, relativizers, such, as, the, adjective, kter, analogous, to, the, english, relative, pronouns, which, that, and, who, whom, as, with, other, adjectives, it, agrees, with, its, associated, noun, in, gender, number, and, case, relative, clauses, follow, the, noun, they, modify, the, following, is, a, glossed, example, chc, i, want, 1sg, nav, t, v, it, visit, inf, universit, u, university, sg, acc, na, on, kter, ou, which, sg, f, acc, chod, attend, 3sg, jan, john, sg, nom, chc, i, nav, t, v, it, universit,

and, adjectives, are, declined, into, one, of, seven, grammatical, cases, which, indicate, their, function, in, a, sentence, two, numbers, singular, and, plural, and, three, genders, masculine, feminine, and, neuter, the, masculine, gender, is, further, divided, into, animate, and, inanimate, classes, a, nominative, accusative, language, czech, marks, subject, nouns, of, transitive, and, intransitive, verbs, in, the, nominative, case, which, is, the, form, found, in, dictionaries, and, direct, objects, of, transitive, verbs, are, declined, in, the, accusative, case, the, vocative, case, is, used, to, address, people, the, remaining, cases, genitive, dative, locative, and, instrumental, indicate, semantic, relationships, such, as, noun, adjuncts, genitive, indirect, objects, dative, or, agents, in, passive, constructions, instrumental, additionally, prepositions, and, some, verbs, require, their, complements, to, be, declined, in, a, certain, case, the, locative, case, is, only, used, after, prepositions, an, adjective, s, case, agrees, with, that, of, the, noun, it, modifies, when, czech, children, learn, their, language, s, declension, patterns, the, cases, are, referred, to, by, number, some, prepositions, require, the, nouns, they, modify, to, take, a, particular, case, the, cases, assigned, by, each, preposition, are, based, on, the, physical, or, metaphorical, direction, or, location, conveyed, by, it, for, example, od, from, away, from, and, z, out, of, off, assign, the, genitive, case, other, prepositions, take, one, of, several, cases, with, their, meaning, dependent, on, the, case, na, means, onto, or, for, with, the, accusative, case, but, on, with, the, locative, this, is, a, glossed, example, of, a, sentence, using, several, cases, nes, l, carry, sg, m, pst, js, em, be, 1, sg, krabic, i, box, sg, acc, do, into, dom, u, house, sg, gen, se, with, sv, m, own, sg, ins, p, tel, em, friend, sg, ins, nes, l, js, em, krabic, i,

czech, distinguishes, three, genders, masculine, feminine, and, neuter, and, the, masculine, gender, is, subdivided, into, animate, and, inanimate, with, few, exceptions, feminine, nouns, in, the, nominative, case, end, in, a, e, or, a, consonant, neuter, nouns, in, o, e, or, and, masculine, nouns, in, a, consonant, adjectives, participles, most, pronouns, and, the, numbers, one, and, two, are, marked, for, gender, and, agree, with, the, gender, of, the, noun, they, modify, or, refer, to, past, tense, verbs, are, also, marked, for, gender, agreeing, with, the, gender, of, the, subject, e, g, d, lal, he, did, or, made, d, lala, she, did, or, made, and, d, lalo, it, did, or, made, gender, also, plays, a, semantic, role, most, nouns, that, describe, people, and, animals, including, personal, names, have, separate, masculine, and, feminine, forms, which, are, normally, formed, by, adding, a, suffix, to, the, stem, for, example, ech, czech, man, has, the, feminine, form, e, ka, czech, woman, nouns, of, different, genders, follow, different, declension, patterns, examples, of, declension, patterns, for, noun, phrases, of, various, genders, follow, nouns, are, also, inflected, for, number, distinguishing, between, singular, and, plural, typical, of, a, slavic, language, czech, cardinal, numbers, one, through, four, allow, the, nouns, and, adjectives, they, modify, to, take, any, case, but, numbers, over, five, require, subject, and, direct, object, noun, phrases, to, be, declined, in, the, genitive, plural, instead, of, the, nominative, or, accusative, and, when, used, as, subjects, these, phrases, take, singular, verbs, for, example, numbers, decline, for, case, and, the, numbers, one, and, two, are, also, inflected, for, gender, numbers, one, through, five, are, shown, below, as, examples, the, number, one, has, declension, patterns, identical, to, those, of, the, demonstrative, pronoun, ten, although, czech, s, grammatical, numbers, are, singular, and, plural, several, residuals, of, dual, forms, remain, such, as, the, words, dva, two, and, oba, both, which, decline, the, same, way, some, nouns, for, paired, body, parts, use, a, historical, dual, form, to, express, plural, in, some, cases, ruka, hand, ruce, nominative, noha, leg, nohama, instrumental, nohou, genitive, locative, oko, eye, o, i, and, ucho, ear, u, i, while, two, of, these, nouns, are, neuter, in, their, singular, forms, all, plural, forms, are, considered, feminine, their, gender, is, relevant, to, their, associated, adjectives, and, verbs, these, forms, are, plural, semantically, used, for, any, non, singular, count, as, in, mezi, ty, ma, o, ima, face, to, face, lit, among, four, eyes, the, plural, number, paradigms, of, these, nouns, are, a, mixture, of, historical, dual, and, plural, forms, for, example, nohy, legs, nominative, accusative, is, a, standard, plural, form, of, this, type, of, noun, czech, verbs, agree, with, their, subjects, in, person, first, second, or, third, number, singular, or, plural, and, in, constructions, involving, participles, which, includes, the, past, tense, also, in, gender, they, are, conjugated, for, tense, past, present, or, future, and, mood, indicative, imperative, or, conditional, for, example, the, conjugated, verb, mluv, me, we, speak, is, in, the, present, tense, and, first, person, plural, it, is, distinguished, from, other, conjugations, of, the, infinitive, mluvit, by, its, ending, me, the, infinitive, form, of, czech, verbs, ends, in, t, archaically, ti, or, ci, it, is, the, form, found, in, dictionaries, and, the, form, that, follows, auxiliary, verbs, for, example, m, u, t, sly, et, i, can, hear, you, typical, of, slavic, languages, czech, marks, its, verbs, for, one, of, two, grammatical, aspects, perfective, and, imperfective, most, verbs, are, part, of, inflected, aspect, pairs, for, example, koupit, perfective, and, kupovat, imperfective, although, the, verbs, meaning, is, similar, in, perfective, verbs, the, action, is, completed, and, in, imperfective, verbs, it, is, ongoing, or, repeated, this, is, distinct, from, past, and, present, tense, any, verb, of, either, aspect, can, be, conjugated, into, either, the, past, or, present, tense, but, the, future, tense, is, only, used, with, imperfective, verbs, aspect, describes, the, state, of, the, action, at, the, time, specified, by, the, tense, the, verbs, of, most, aspect, pairs, differ, in, one, of, two, ways, by, prefix, or, by, suffix, in, prefix, pairs, the, perfective, verb, has, an, added, prefix, for, example, the, imperfective, ps, t, to, write, to, be, writing, compared, with, the, perfective, napsat, to, write, down, the, most, common, prefixes, are, na, o, po, s, u, vy, z, and, za, in, suffix, pairs, a, different, infinitive, ending, is, added, to, the, perfective, stem, for, example, the, perfective, verbs, koupit, to, buy, and, prodat, to, sell, have, the, imperfective, forms, kupovat, and, prod, vat, imperfective, verbs, may, undergo, further, morphology, to, make, other, imperfective, verbs, iterative, and, frequentative, forms, denoting, repeated, or, regular, action, the, verb, j, t, to, go, has, the, iterative, form, chodit, to, go, regularly, and, the, frequentative, form, chod, vat, to, go, occasionally, to, tend, to, go, many, verbs, have, only, one, aspect, and, verbs, describing, continual, states, of, being, b, t, to, be, cht, t, to, want, moct, to, be, able, to, le, et, to, lie, down, to, be, lying, down, have, no, perfective, form, conversely, verbs, describing, immediate, states, of, change, for, example, ot, hotn, t, to, become, pregnant, and, nadchnout, se, to, become, enthusiastic, have, no, imperfective, aspect, the, present, tense, in, czech, is,

of, around, 23, nonetheless, concluded, that, there, remained, a, high, degree, of, mutual, intelligibility, between, the, two, languages, grammatically, both, languages, share, a, common, syntax, one, study, showed, that, czech, and, slovak, lexicons, differed, by, 80, percent, but, this, high, percentage, was, found, to, stem, primarily, from, differing, orthographies, and, slight,

more, borrowed, words, than, czech, the, similarities, between, czech, and, slovak, led, to, the, languages, being, considered, a, single, language, by, a, group, of, 19th, century, scholars, who,
