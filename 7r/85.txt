were, called, publicani, or, societas, publicanorum, as, individual, companies, these, companies, were, similar, to, modern, corporations, or, joint, stock, companies, more, specifically, in, a, couple, of, aspects, they, issued, shares, called, partes, for, large, cooperatives, and, particulae, which, were, small, shares, that, acted, like, today, s, over, the, counter, shares, polybius, mentions, that, almost, every, citizen, participated, in, the, government, leases, there, is, also, evidence, that, the, price, of, stocks, fluctuated, the, roman, orator, cicero, speaks, of, partes, illo, tempore, carissimae, which, means, shares, that, had, a, very, high, price, at, that, time, this, implies, a, fluctuation, of, price, and, stock, market, behavior, in, rome, around, 1250, in, france, at, toulouse, 100, shares, of, the, soci, t, des, moulins, du, bazacle, or, bazacle, milling, company, were, traded, at, a, value, that, depended, on, the, profitability, of, the, mills, the, society, owned, in, 1288, the, bishop, of, v, ster, s, acquired, a, 12, 5, interest, in, great, copper, mountain, stora, kopparberget, in, swedish, which, contained, the, falun, mine, the, swedish, mining, and, forestry, products, company, stora, has, documented, a, stock, transfer, in, 1288, in, exchange, for, an, estate, the, earliest, recognized, joint, stock, company, in, modern, times, was, the, english, later, british, east, india, company, it, was, granted, an, english, royal, charter, by, elizabeth, i, on, 31, december, 1600, with, the, intention, of, favouring, trade, privileges, in, india, the, royal, charter, effectively, gave, the, newly, created, honourable, east, india, company, heic, a, 15, year, monopoly, on, all, trade, in, the, east, indies, soon, afterwards, in, 1602, the, dutch, east, india, company, issued, the, first, shares, that, were, made, tradeable, on, the, amsterdam, stock, exchange, between, 1602, and, 1796, it, traded, 2, 5, million, tons, of, cargo, with, asia, on, 4, 785, ships, and, sent, a, million, europeans, to, work, in, asia, a, shareholder, or, stockholder, is, an, individual, or, company, including, a, corporation, that, legally, owns, one, or, more, shares, of, stock, in, a, joint, stock, company, both, private, and, public, traded, companies, have, shareholders, shareholders, are, granted, special, privileges, depending, on, the, class, of, stock, including, the, right, to, vote, on, matters, such, as, elections, to, the, board, of, directors, the, right, to, share, in, distributions, of, the, company, s, income, the, right, to, purchase, new, shares, issued, by, the, company, and, the, right, to, a, company, s, assets, during, a, liquidation, of, the, company, however, shareholder, s, rights, to, a, company, s, assets, are, subordinate, to, the, rights, of, the, company, s, creditors, shareholders, are, one, type, of, stakeholders, who, may, include, anyone, who, has, a, direct, or, indirect, equity, interest, in, the, business, entity, or, someone, with, a, non, equity, interest, in, a, non, profit, organization, thus, it, might, be, common, to, call, volunteer, contributors, to, an, association, stakeholders, even, though, they, are, not, shareholders, although, directors, and, officers, of, a, company, are, bound, by, fiduciary, duties, to, act, in, the, best, interest, of, the, shareholders, the, shareholders, themselves, normally, do, not, have, such, duties, towards, each, other, however, in, a, few, unusual, cases, some, courts, have, been, willing, to, imply, such, a, duty, between, shareholders, for, example, in, california, united, states, majority, shareholders, of, closely, held, corporations, have, a, duty, not, to, destroy, the, value, of, the, shares, held, by, minority, shareholders, the, largest, shareholders, in, terms, of, percentages, of, companies, owned, are, often, mutual, funds, and, especially, passively, managed, exchange, traded, funds, the, owners, of, a, private, company, may, want, additional, capital, to, invest, in, new, projects, within, the, company, they, may, also, simply, wish, to, reduce, their, holding, freeing, up, capital, for, their, own, private, use, they, can, achieve, these, goals, by, selling, shares, in, the, company, to, the, general, public, through, a, sale, on, a, stock, exchange, this, process, is, called, an, initial, public, offering, or, ipo, by, selling, shares, they, can, sell, part, or, all, of, the, company, to, many, part, owners, the, purchase, of, one, share, entitles, the, owner, of, that, share, to, literally, share, in, the, ownership, of, the, company, a, fraction, of, the, decision, making, power, and, potentially, a, fraction, of, the, profits, which, the, company, may, issue, as, dividends, the, owner, may, also, inherit, debt, and, even, litigation, in, the, common, case, of, a, publicly, traded, corporation, where, there, may, be, thousands, of, shareholders, it, is, impractical, to, have, all, of, them, making, the, daily, decisions, required, to, run, a, company, thus, the, shareholders, will, use, their, shares, as, votes, in, the, election, of, members, of, the, board, of, directors, of, the, company, in, a, typical, case, each, share, constitutes, one, vote, corporations, may, however, issue, different, classes, of, shares, which, may, have, different, voting, rights, owning, the, majority, of, the, shares, allows, other, shareholders, to, be, out, voted, effective, control, rests, with, the, majority, shareholder, or, shareholders, acting, in, concert, in, this, way, the, original, owners, of, the, company, often, still, have, control, of, the, company, although, ownership, of, 50, of, shares, does, result, in, 50, ownership, of, a, company, it, does, not, give, the, shareholder, the, right, to, use, a, company, s, building, equipment, materials, or, other, property, this, is, because, the, company, is, considered, a, legal, person, thus, it, owns, all, its, assets, itself, this, is, important, in, areas, such, as, insurance, which, must, be, in, the, name, of, the, company, and, not, the, main, shareholder, in, most, countries, boards, of, directors, and, company, managers, have, a, fiduciary, responsibility, to, run, the, company, in, the, interests, of, its, stockholders, nonetheless, as, martin, whitman, writes, even, though, the, board, of, directors, runs, the, company, the, shareholder, has, some, impact, on, the, company, s, policy, as, the, shareholders, elect, the, board, of, directors, each, shareholder, typically, has, a, percentage, of, votes, equal, to, the, percentage, of, shares, he, or, she, owns, so, as, long, as, the, shareholders, agree, that, the, management, agent, are, performing, poorly, they, can, select, a, new, board, of, directors, which, can, then, hire, a, new, management, team, in, practice, however, genuinely, contested, board, elections, are, rare, board, candidates, are, usually, nominated, by, insiders, or, by, the, board, of, the, directors, themselves, and, a, considerable, amount, of, stock, is, held, or, voted, by, insiders, owning, shares, does, not, mean, responsibility, for, liabilities, if, a, company, goes, broke, and, has, to, default, on, loans, the, shareholders, are, not, liable, in, any, way, however, all, money, obtained, by, converting, assets, into, cash, will, be, used, to, repay, loans, and, other, debts, first, so, that, shareholders, cannot, receive, any, money, unless, and, until, creditors, have, been, paid, often, the, shareholders, end, up, with, nothing, financing, a, company, through, the, sale, of, stock, in, a, company, is, known, as, equity, financing, alternatively, debt, financing, for, example, issuing, bonds, can, be, done, to, avoid, giving, up, shares, of, ownership, of, the, company, unofficial, financing, known, as, trade, financing, usually, provides, the, major, part, of, a, company, s, working, capital, day, to, day, operational, needs, in, general, the, shares, of, a, company, may, be, transferred, from, shareholders, to, other, parties, by, sale, or, other, mechanisms, unless, prohibited, most, jurisdictions, have, established, laws, and, regulations, governing, such, transfers, particularly, if, the, issuer, is, a, publicly, traded, entity, the, desire, of, stockholders, to, trade, their, shares, has, led, to, the, establishment, of, stock, exchanges, organizations, which, provide, marketplaces, for, trading, shares, and, other, derivatives, and, financial, products, today, stock, traders, are, usually, represented, by, a, stockbroker, who, buys, and, sells, shares, of, a, wide, range, of, companies, on, such, exchanges, a, company, may, list, its, shares, on, an, exchange, by, meeting, and, maintaining, the, listing, requirements, of, a, particular, stock, exchange, many, large, non, u, s, companies, choose, to, list, on, a, u, s, exchange, as, well, as, an, exchange, in, their, home, country, in, order, to, broaden, their, investor, base, these, companies, must, maintain, a, block, of, shares, at, a, bank, in, the, us, typically, a, certain, percentage, of, their, capital, on, this, basis, the, holding, bank, establishes, american, depositary, shares, and, issues, an, american, depositary, receipt, adr, for, each, share, a, trader, acquires, likewise, many, large, u, s, companies, list, their, shares, at, foreign, exchanges, to, raise, capital, abroad, small, companies, that, do, not, qualify, and, cannot, meet, the, listing, requirements, of, the, major, exchanges, may, be, traded, over, the, counter, otc, by, an, off, exchange, mechanism, in, which, trading, occurs, directly, between, parties, the, major, otc, markets, in, the, united, states, are, the, electronic, quotation, systems, otc, bulletin, board, otcbb, and, otc, markets, group, formerly, known, as, pink, otc, markets, inc, where, individual, retail, investors, are, also, represented, by, a, brokerage, firm, and, the, quotation, service, s, requirements, for, a, company, to, be, listed, are, minimal, shares, of, companies, in, bankruptcy, proceedings, are, usually, listed, by, these, quotation, services, after, the, stock, is, delisted, from, an, exchange, there, are, various, methods, of, buying, and, financing, stocks, the, most, common, being, through, a, stockbroker, brokerage, firms, whether, they, are, a, full, service, or, discount, broker, arrange, the, transfer, of, stock, from, a, seller, to, a, buyer, most, trades, are, actually, done, through, brokers, listed, with, a, stock, exchange, there, are, many, different, brokerage, firms, from, which, to, choose, such, as, full, service, brokers, or, discount, brokers, the, full, service, brokers, usually, charge, more, per, trade, but, give, investment, advice, or, more, personal, service, the, discount, brokers, offer, little, or, no, investment, advice, but, charge, less, for, trades, another, type, of, broker, would, be, a, bank, or, credit, union, that, may, have, a, deal, set, up, with, either, a, full, service, or, discount, broker, there, are, other, ways, of, buying, stock, besides, through, a, broker, one, way, is, directly, from, the, company, itself, if, at, least, one, share, is, owned, most, companies, will, allow, the, purchase, of, shares, directly, from, the, company, through, their, investor, relations, departments, however, the, initial, share, of, stock, in, the, company, will, have, to, be, obtained, through, a, regular, stock, broker, another, way, to, buy, stock, in, companies, is, through, direct, public, offerings, which, are, usually, sold, by, the, company, itself, a, direct, public, offering, is, an, initial, public, offering, in, which, the, stock, is, purchased, directly, from, the, company, usually, without, the, aid, of, brokers, when, it, comes, to, financing, a, purchase, of, stocks, there, are, two, ways, purchasing, stock, with, money, that, is, currently, in, the, buyer, s, ownership, or, by, buying, stock, on, margin, buying, stock, on, margin, means, buying, stock, with, money, borrowed, against, the, value, of, stocks, in, the, same, account, these, stocks, or, collateral, guarantee, that, the, buyer, can, repay, the, loan, otherwise, the, stockbroker, has, the, right, to, sell, the, stock, collateral, to, repay, the, borrowed, money, he, can, sell, if, the, share, price, drops, below, the, margin, requirement, at, least, 50, of, the, value, of, the, stocks, in, the, account, buying, on, margin, works, the, same, way, as, borrowing, money, to, buy, a, car, or, a, house, using, a, car, or, house, as, collateral, moreover, borrowing, is, not, free, the, broker, usually, charges, 8, 10, interest, selling, stock, is, procedurally, similar, to, buying, stock, generally, the, investor, wants, to, buy, low, and, sell, high, if, not, in, that, order, short, selling, although, a, number, of, reasons, may, induce, an, investor, to, sell, at, a, loss, e, g, to, avoid, further, loss, as, with, buying, a, stock, there, is, a, transaction, fee, for, the, broker, s, efforts, in, arranging, the, transfer, of, stock, from, a, seller, to, a, buyer, this, fee, can, be, high, or, low, depending, on, which, type, of, brokerage, full, service, or, discount, handles, the, transaction, after, the, transaction, has, been, made, the, seller, is, then, entitled, to, all, of, the, money, an, important, part, of, selling, is, keeping, track, of, the, earnings, importantly, on, selling, the, stock, in, jurisdictions, that, have, them, capital, gains, taxes, will, have, to, be, paid, on, the, additional, proceeds, if, any, that, are, in, excess, of, the, cost, basis, short, selling, consists, of, an, investor, immediately, selling, borrowed, shares, and, then, buying, them, back, when, their, price, has, gone, down, called, covering, essentially, such, an, investor, bets, that, the, price, of, the, shares, will, drop, so, that, they, can, be, bought, back, at, the, lower, price, and, thus, returned, to, the, lender, at, a, profit, the, risks, of, short, selling, stock, are, usually, higher, than, those, of, buying, stock, this, is, because, the, loss, can, theoretically, be, unlimited, since, the, stock, s, value, can, theoretically, go, up, indefinitely, the, price, of, a, stock, fluctuates, fundamentally, due, to, the, theory, of, supply, and, demand, like, all, commodities, in, the, market, the, price, of, a, stock, is, sensitive, to, demand, however, there, are, many, factors, that, influence, the, demand, for, a, particular, stock, the, fields, of, fundamental, analysis, and, technical, analysis, attempt, to, understand, market, conditions, that, lead, to, price, changes, or, even, predict, future, price, levels, a, recent, study, shows, that, customer, satisfaction, as, measured, by, the, american, customer, satisfaction, index, acsi, is, significantly, correlated, to, the, market, value, of, a, stock, stock, price, may, be, influenced, by, analysts, business, forecast, for, the, company, and, outlooks, for, the, company, s, general, market, segment, stocks, can, also, fluctuate, greatly, due, to, pump, and, dump, scams, also, see, list, of, s, p, 600, companies, at, any, given, moment, an, equity, s, price, is, strictly, a, result, of, supply, and, demand, the, supply, commonly, referred, to, as, the, float, is, the, number, of, shares, offered, for, sale, at, any, one, moment, the, demand, is, the, number, of, shares, investors, wish, to, buy, at, exactly, that, same, time, the, price, of, the, stock, moves, in, order, to, achieve, and, maintain, equilibrium, the, product, of, this, instantaneous, price, and, the, float, at, any, one, time, is, the, market, capitalization, of, the, entity, offering, the, equity, at, that, point, in, time, when, prospective, buyers, outnumber, sellers, the, price, rises, eventually, sellers, attracted, to, the, high, selling, price, enter, the, market, and, or, buyers, leave, achieving, equilibrium, between, buyers, and, sellers, when, sellers, outnumber, buyers, the, price, falls, eventually, buyers, enter, and, or, sellers, leave, again, achieving, equilibrium, thus, the, value, of, a, share, of, a, company, at, any, given, moment, is, determined, by, all, investors, voting, with, their, money, if, more, investors, want, a, stock, and, are, willing, to, pay, more, the, price, will, go, up, if, more, investors, are, selling, a, stock, and, there, are, not, enough, buyers, the, price, will, go, down, that, does, not, explain, how, people, decide, the, maximum, price, at, which, they, are, willing, to, buy, or, the, minimum, at, which, they, are, willing, to, sell, in, professional, investment, circles, the, efficient, market, hypothesis, emh, continues, to, be, popular, although, this, theory, is, controversial, in, academic, and, professional, circles, briefly, emh, says, that, investing, is, overall, weighted, by, the, standard, deviation, rational, that, the, price, of, a, stock, at, any, given, moment, represents, a, rational, evaluation, of, the, known, information, that, might, bear, on, the, future, value, of, the, company, and, that, share, prices, of, equities, are, priced, efficiently, which, is, to, say, that, they, represent, accurately, the, expected, value, of, the, stock, as, best, it, can, be, known, at, a, given, moment, in, other, words, prices, are, the, result, of, discounting, expected, future, cash, flows, the, emh, model, if, true, has, at, least, two, interesting, consequences, first, because, financial, risk, is, presumed, to, require, at, least, a, small, premium, on, expected, value, the, return, on, equity, can, be, expected, to, be, slightly, greater, than, that, available, from, non, equity, investments, if, not, the, same, rational, calculations, would, lead, equity, investors, to, shift, to, these, safer, non, equity, investments, that, could, be, expected, to, give, the, same, or, better, return, at, lower, risk, second, because, the, price, of, a, share, at, every, given, moment, is, an, efficient, reflection, of, expected, value, then, relative, to, the, curve, of, expected, return, prices, will, tend, to, follow, a, random, walk, determined, by, the, emergence, of, information, randomly, over, time, professional, equity, investors, therefore, immerse, themselves, in, the, flow, of, fundamental, information, seeking, to, gain, an, advantage, over, their, competitors, mainly, other, professional, investors, by, more, intelligently, interpreting, the, emerging, flow, of, information, news, the, emh, model, does, not, seem, to, give, a, complete, description, of, the, process, of, equity, price, determination, for, example, stock, markets, are, more, volatile, than, emh, would, imply, in, recent, years, it, has, come, to, be, accepted, that, the, share, markets, are, not, perfectly, efficient, perhaps, especially, in, emerging, markets, or, other, markets, that, are, not, dominated, by, well, informed, professional, investors, another, theory, of, share, price, determination, comes, from, the, field, of, behavioral, finance, according, to, behavioral, finance, humans, often, make, irrational, decisions, particularly, related, to, the, buying, and, selling, of, securities, based, upon, fears, and, misperceptions, of, outcomes, the, irrational, trading, of, securities, can, often, create, securities, prices, which, vary, from, rational, fundamental, price, valuations, for, instance, during, the, technology, bubble, of, the, late, 1990s, which, was, followed, by, the, dot, com, bust, of, 2000, 2002, technology, companies, were, often, bid, beyond, any, rational, fundamental, value, because, of, what, is, commonly, known, as, the, greater, fool, theory, the, greater, fool, theory, holds, that, because, the, predominant, method, of, realizing, returns, in, equity, is, from, the, sale, to, another, investor, one, should, select, securities, that, they, believe, that, someone, else, will, value, at, a, higher, level, at, some, point, in, the, future, without, regard, to, the, basis, for, that, other, party, s, willingness, to, pay, a, higher, price, thus, even, a, rational, investor, may, bank, on, others, irrationality, when, companies, raise, capital, by, offering, stock, on, more, than, one, exchange, the, potential, exists, for, discrepancies, in, the, valuation, of, shares, on, different, exchanges, a, keen, investor, with, access, to, information, about, such, discrepancies, may, invest, in, expectation, of, their, eventual, convergence, known, as, arbitrage, trading, electronic, trading, has, resulted, in, extensive, price, transparency, efficient, market, hypothesis, and, these, discrepancies, if, they, exist, are, short, lived, and, quickly, equilibrated
