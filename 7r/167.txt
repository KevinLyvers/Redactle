by, some, and, as, such, it, is, reported, in, many, hadiths, that, it, is, prohibited, to, say, only, ramadan, in, reference, to, the, calendar, month, and, that, it, is, necessary, to, say, month, of, ramadan, as, reported, in, sunni, shia, and, zaydi, sources, however, the, report, has, been, graded, by, others, as, maw, fabricated, and, inauthentic, in, the, persian, language, the, arabic, letter, d, is, pronounced, as, z, the, muslim, communities, in, some, countries, with, historical, persian, influence, such, as, afghanistan, azerbaijan, iran, india, pakistan, and, turkey, use, the,

and, the, standard, to, distinguish, between, right, and, wrong, so, whoever, is, present, this, month, let, them, fast, but, whoever, is, ill, or, on, a, journey, then, let, them, fast, an, equal, number, of, days, after, rama, n, allah, intends, ease, for, you, not, hardship, so, that, you, may, complete, the, prescribed, period, and, proclaim, the, greatness, of, allah, for, guiding, you,
