generally, have, the, same, goal, selling, is, the, final, stage, in, marketing, which, puts, the, plan, into, effect, a, marketing, plan, includes, pricing, promotion, place, and, product, the, 4, p, s, a, marketing, department, in, an, organization, has, the, goals, of, increasing, the, desirability, and, value, of, the, products, and, services, to, the, customer, and, increasing, the, number, and, engagement, of, successful, interactions, between, potential, customers, and, the, organization, achieving, this, goal, may, involve, the, sales, team, using, promotional, techniques, such, as, advertising, sales, promotion, publicity, and, public, relations, creating, new, sales, channels, or, creating, new, products, it, can, also, include, encouraging, the, potential, customer, to, visit,

values, play, a, major, role, in, consumer, decision, processes, marketing, is, the, whole, of, the, work, on, persuasion, made, for, the, whole, of, the, target, people, sales, is, the, process, of, persuasion, and, effort, from, one, person, to, one, person, b2c, or, one, person, to, a, corporation, b2b, in, order, to, make, a, living, resource, enter, the, company, this, may, occur, in, person, over, the, phone, or, digitally, the, field, of, sales, process, engineering, views, sales, as, the, output, of, a, larger, system, not, just, as, the, output, of, one, department, the, larger, system, includes, many, functional, areas, within, an, organization, from, this, perspective, the, labels, sales, and, marketing, cover, several, processes, whose, inputs, and, outputs, supply, one, another, in, this, context, improving, an, output, such, as, sales, involves, studying, and, improving, the, broader, sales, process, since, the, component, functional, areas, interact, and, are, interdependent, many, large, corporations, structure, their, marketing, departments, so, they, are, integrated, with, all, areas, of, the, business, they, create, multiple, teams, with, a, singular, focus, and, the, managers, of, these, teams, must, coordinate, efforts, to, drive, profits, and, business, success, for, example, an, inbound, campaign, seeks, to, drive, more, customers, through, the, door, giving, the, sales, department, a, better, chance, of, selling, their, product, to, the, consumer, a, good, marketing, program, would, address, any, potential, downsides, as, well, the, sales, department, would, aim, to, improve, the, interaction, between, the, customer, and, the, sales, channel, or, salesperson, as, sales, is, the, forefront, of, any, organization, this, would, always, need, to, take, place, before, any, other, business, process, may, begin, sales, management, involves, breaking, down, the, selling, process, and, increasing, the, effectiveness, of, the, discrete, processes, as, well, as, improving, the, interactions, between, processes, for, example, in, an, outbound, sales, environment, the, typical, process, includes, outbound, calling, the, sales, pitch, handling, objections, opportunity, identification, and, the, close, each, step, of, the, process, has, sales, related, issues, skills, and, training, needs, as, well, as, marketing, solutions, to, improve, each, discrete, step, one, further, common, complication, of, marketing, is, the, difficulty, in, measuring, results, for, some, marketing, initiatives, some, marketing, and, advertising, executives, focus, on, creativity, and, innovation, without, concern, for, the, top, or, bottom, lines, a, fundamental, pitfall, of, marketing, for, marketing, s, sake, many, companies, find, it, challenging, to, get, their, marketing, and, sales, teams, to, agree, the, two, departments, although, different, in, nature, handle, very, similar, concepts, and, have, to, work, together, to, achieve, the, business, s, goals, building, a, good, relationship, between, the, two, teams, that, encourages, communication, can, be, the, key, to, success, the, idea, that, marketing, can, potentially, eliminate, the, need, for, salespeople, depends, entirely, on, context, for, example, this, may, be, possible, in, some, b2c, situations, however, for, many, b2b, transactions, for, example, those, involving, industrial, organizations, this, is, mostly, impossible, another, dimension, is, the, value, of, the, goods, being, sold, fast, moving, consumer, goods, fmcg, require, no, salespeople, at, the, point, of, sale, to, get, them, to, jump, off, the, supermarket, shelf, and, into, the, customer, s, trolley, however, the, purchase, of, large, mining, equipment, worth, millions, of, dollars, will, require, a, salesperson, to, manage, the, sales, process, particularly, in, the, face, of, competitors, small, and, medium, businesses, selling, such, large, ticket, items, to, a, geographically, dispersed, client, base, use, manufacturers, representatives, to, provide, this, highly, personal, service, while, avoiding, the, large, expense, of, a, captive, sales, force, another, area, of, discussion, involves, the, need, for, alignment, and, integration, of, corporate, sales, and, marketing, functions, according, to, a, report, from, the, chief, marketing, officer, cmo, council, only, 40, percent, of, companies, have, formal, programs, systems, or, processes, in, place, to, align, and, integrate, the, two, critical, functions, sales, digital, marketing, and, automated, marketing, campaigns, with, the, increase, of, the, use, of, the, internet, today, sales, functions, of, several, enterprises, are, finding, traditional, methods, of, marketing, quite, old, fashioned, and, less, efficient, so, the, use, of, automated, marketing, applications, is, on, the, rise, ranging, from, customer, relationship, management, crm, to, sales, force, management, traditionally, these, two, functions, as, referred, above, have, operated, separately, left, in, siloed, areas, of, tactical, responsibility, glen, petersen, s, book, the, profit, maximization, paradox, sees, the, changes, in, the, competitive, landscape, between, the, 1950s, and, the, time, of, writing, as, so, dramatic, that, the, complexity, of, choice, price, and, opportunities, for, the, customer, forced, this, seemingly, simple, and, integrated, relationship, between, sales, and, marketing, to, change, forever, petersen, goes, on, to, highlight, that, salespeople, spend, approximately, 40, percent, of, their, time, preparing, customer, facing, deliverables, while, leveraging, less, than, 50, percent, of, the, materials, created, by, marketing, adding, to, perceptions, that, marketing, is, out, of, touch, with, the, customer, and, that, sales, is, resistant, to, messaging, and, strategy, a, sale, can, take, place, through, face, to, face, contact, via, mail, order, through, a, vending, machine, or, through, online, selling, other, methods, of, selling, include, agents, in, the, sales, process, can, represent, either, of, two, parties, in, the, sales, process, for, example, in, the, united, states, the, fair, labor, standards, act, defines, outside, sales, representatives, as, employees, sell, their, employer, s, products, services, or, facilities, to, customers, away, from, their, employer, s, place, s, of, business, in, general, either, at, the, customer, s, place, of, business, or, by, selling, door, to, door, at, the, customer, s, home, while, defining, those, who, work, from, the, employer, s, location, as, inside, sales, inside, sales, generally, involves, attempting, to, close, business, primarily, over, the, phone, via, telemarketing, while, outside, sales, or, field, sales, will, usually, involve, initial, phone, work, to, book, sales, calls, at, the, potential, buyer, s, location, to, attempt, to, close, the, deal, in, person, some, companies, have, an, inside, sales, department, that, works, with, outside, representatives, and, book, their, appointments, for, them, inside, sales, sometimes, refers, to, upselling, to, existing, customers, sales, coaching, is, a, one, on, one, coaching, process, by, high, performing, sales, professionals, and, consultants, with, salespeople, managers, and, executives, the, process, involves, equipping, them, with, the, knowledge, abilities, and, skills, needed, to, become, more, effective, sales, professionals, unlike, sales, training, sales, coaching, is, typically, an, individualized, ongoing, endeavor, in, common, law, countries, sales, are, governed, generally, by, the, common, law, and, commercial, codes, in, the, united, states, the, laws, governing, sales, of, goods, are, mostly, uniform, to, the, extent, that, most, jurisdictions, have, adopted, article, 2, of, the, uniform, commercial, code, albeit, with, some, non, uniform, variations, the, european, commission, proposed, adoption, of, a, common, european, sales, law, in, 2011, and, set, out, a, proposed, regulation, on, this, area, of, law, in, 2014, whilst, remaining, optional, the, commission, s, intention, was, to, offer, traders, a, means, of, breaking, down, barriers, occasioned, by, the, different, legal, systems, of, its, then, 28, member, states, a, 2012, communication, from, the, commission, argued, that, a, common, european, sales, law, would, help, to, address, some, of, the, concerns, which, it, had, identified, in, the, development, of, a, market, for, cloud, computing, services, however, the, proposal, was, withdrawn, in, december, 2014, when, the, commission, s, work, plan, was, rationalised
