finance, refers, to, monetary, resources, and, to, the, study, and, discipline, of, money, currency, assets, and, liabilities, as, a, subject, of, study, it, is, related, to, but, distinct, from, economics, which, is, the, study, of, the, production, distribution, and, consumption, of, goods, and, services, based, on, the, scope, of, financial, activities, in, financial, systems, the, discipline, can, be, divided, into, personal, corporate, and, public, finance, in, these, financial, systems, assets, are, bought, sold, or, traded, as, financial, instruments, such, as, currencies, loans, bonds, shares, stocks, options, futures, etc, assets, can, also, be, banked, invested, and, insured, to, maximize, value, and, minimize, loss, in, practice, risks, are, always, present, in, any, financial, action, and, entities, due, to, its, wide, scope, a, broad, range, of, subfields, exists, within, finance, asset, money, risk, and, investment, management, aim, to, maximize, value, and, minimize, volatility, financial, analysis, assesses, the, viability, stability, and, profitability, of, an, action, or, entity, some, fields, are, multidisciplinary, such, as, mathematical, finance, financial, law, financial, economics, financial, engineering, and, financial, technology, these, fields, are, the, foundation, of, business, and, accounting, in, some, cases, theories, in, finance, can, be, tested, using, the, scientific, method, covered, by, experimental, finance, the, early, history, of, finance, parallels, the, early, history, of, money, which, is, prehistoric, ancient, and, medieval, civilizations, incorporated, basic, functions, of, finance, such, as, banking, trading, and, accounting, into, their, economies, in, the, late, 19th, century, the, global, financial, system, was, formed, in, the, middle, of, the, 20th, century, finance, emerged, as, a, distinct, academic, discipline, separate, from, economics, the, earliest, doctoral, programs, in, finance, were, established, in, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, today, finance, is, also, widely, studied, through, career, focused, undergraduate, and, master, s, level, programs, as, outlined, the, financial, system, consists, of, the, flows, of, capital, that, take, place, between, individuals, and, households, personal, finance, governments, public, finance, and, businesses, corporate, finance, finance, thus, studies, the, process, of, channeling, money, from, savers, and, investors, to, entities, that, need, it, savers, and, investors, have, money, available, which, could, earn, interest, or, dividends, if, put, to, productive, use, individuals, companies, and, governments, must, obtain, money, from, some, external, source, such, as, loans, or, credit, when, they, lack, sufficient, funds, to, run, their, operations, in, general, an, entity, whose, income, exceeds, its, expenditure, can, lend, or, invest, the, excess, intending, to, earn, a, fair, return, correspondingly, an, entity, where, income, is, less, than, expenditure, can, raise, capital, usually, in, one, of, two, ways, i, by, borrowing, in, the, form, of, a, loan, private, individuals, or, by, selling, government, or, corporate, bonds, ii, by, a, corporation, selling, equity, also, called, stock, or, shares, which, may, take, various, forms, preferred, stock, or, common, stock, the, owners, of, both, bonds, and, stock, may, be, institutional, investors, financial, institutions, such, as, investment, banks, and, pension, funds, or, private, individuals, called, private, investors, or, retail, investors, see, financial, market, participants, the, lending, is, often, indirect, through, a, financial, intermediary, such, as, a, bank, or, via, the, purchase, of, notes, or, bonds, corporate, bonds, government, bonds, or, mutual, bonds, in, the, bond, market, the, lender, receives, interest, the, borrower, pays, a, higher, interest, than, the, lender, receives, and, the, financial, intermediary, earns, the, difference, for, arranging, the, loan, a, bank, aggregates, the, activities, of, many, borrowers, and, lenders, a, bank, accepts, deposits, from, lenders, on, which, it, pays, interest, the, bank, then, lends, these, deposits, to, borrowers, banks, allow, borrowers, and, lenders, of, different, sizes, to, coordinate, their, activity, investing, typically, entails, the, purchase, of, stock, either, individual, securities, or, via, a, mutual, fund, for, example, stocks, are, usually, sold, by, corporations, to, investors, so, as, to, raise, required, capital, in, the, form, of, equity, financing, as, distinct, from, the, debt, financing, described, above, the, financial, intermediaries, here, are, the, investment, banks, the, investment, banks, find, the, initial, investors, and, facilitate, the, listing, of, the, securities, typically, shares, and, bonds, additionally, they, facilitate, the, securities, exchanges, which, allow, their, trade, thereafter, as, well, as, the, various, service, providers, which, manage, the, performance, or, risk, of, these, investments, these, latter, include, mutual, funds, pension, funds, wealth, managers, and, stock, brokers, typically, servicing, retail, investors, private, individuals, inter, institutional, trade, and, investment, and, fund, management, at, this, scale, is, referred, to, as, wholesale, finance, institutions, here, extend, the, products, offered, with, related, trading, to, include, bespoke, options, swaps, and, structured, products, as, well, as, specialized, financing, this, financial, engineering, is, inherently, mathematical, and, these, institutions, are, then, the, major, employers, of, quants, see, below, in, these, institutions, risk, management, regulatory, capital, and, compliance, play, major, roles, as, outlined, finance, comprises, broadly, the, three, areas, of, personal, finance, corporate, finance, and, public, finance, these, in, turn, overlap, and, employ, various, activities, and, sub, disciplines, chiefly, investments, risk, management, and, quantitative, finance, personal, finance, refers, to, the, practice, of, budgeting, to, ensure, enough, funds, are, available, to, meet, basic, needs, while, ensuring, there, is, only, a, reasonable, level, of, risk, to, lose, said, capital, personal, finance, may, involve, paying, for, education, financing, durable, goods, such, as, real, estate, and, cars, buying, insurance, investing, and, saving, for, retirement, personal, finance, may, also, involve, paying, for, a, loan, or, other, debt, obligations, the, main, areas, of, personal, finance, are, considered, to, be, income, spending, saving, investing, and, protection, the, following, steps, as, outlined, by, the, financial, planning, standards, board, suggest, that, an, individual, will, understand, a, potentially, secure, personal, finance, plan, after, corporate, finance, deals, with, the, actions, that, managers, take, to, increase, the, value, of, the, firm, to, the, shareholders, the, sources, of, funding, and, the, capital, structure, of, corporations, and, the, tools, and, analysis, used, to, allocate, financial, resources, while, corporate, finance, is, in, principle, different, from, managerial, finance, which, studies, the, financial, management, of, all, firms, rather, than, corporations, alone, the, concepts, are, applicable, to, the, financial, problems, of, all, firms, and, this, area, is, then, often, referred, to, as, business, finance, typically, corporate, finance, relates, to, the, long, term, objective, of, maximizing, the, value, of, the, entity, s, assets, its, stock, and, its, return, to, shareholders, while, also, balancing, risk, and, profitability, this, entails, three, primary, areas, the, latter, creates, the, link, with, investment, banking, and, securities, trading, as, above, in, that, the, capital, raised, will, generically, comprise, debt, i, e, corporate, bonds, and, equity, often, listed, shares, re, risk, management, within, corporates, see, below, financial, managers, i, e, as, distinct, from, corporate, financiers, focus, more, on, the, short, term, elements, of, profitability, cash, flow, and, working, capital, management, inventory, credit, and, debtors, ensuring, that, the, firm, can, safely, and, profitably, carry, out, its, financial, and, operational, objectives, i, e, that, it, 1, can, service, both, maturing, short, term, debt, repayments, and, scheduled, long, term, debt, payments, and, 2, has, sufficient, cash, flow, for, ongoing, and, upcoming, operational, expenses, see, financial, management, and, financial, planning, and, analysis, public, finance, describes, finance, as, related, to, sovereign, states, sub, national, entities, and, related, public, entities, or, agencies, it, generally, encompasses, a, long, term, strategic, perspective, regarding, investment, decisions, that, affect, public, entities, these, long, term, strategic, periods, typically, encompass, five, or, more, years, public, finance, is, primarily, concerned, with, central, banks, such, as, the, federal, reserve, system, banks, in, the, united, states, and, the, bank, of, england, in, the, united, kingdom, are, strong, players, in, public, finance, they, act, as, lenders, of, last, resort, as, well, as, strong, influences, on, monetary, and, credit, conditions, in, the, economy, development, finance, which, is, related, concerns, investment, in, economic, development, projects, provided, by, a, quasi, governmental, institution, on, a, non, commercial, basis, these, projects, would, otherwise, not, be, able, to, get, financing, a, public, private, partnership, is, primarily, used, for, infrastructure, projects, a, private, sector, corporate, provides, the, financing, up, front, and, then, draws, profits, from, taxpayers, or, users, climate, finance, and, the, related, environmental, finance, address, the, financial, strategies, resources, and, instruments, used, in, climate, change, mitigation, investment, management, is, the, professional, asset, management, of, various, securities, typically, shares, and, bonds, but, also, other, assets, such, as, real, estate, commodities, and, alternative, investments, in, order, to, meet, specified, investment, goals, for, the, benefit, of, investors, as, above, investors, may, be, institutions, such, as, insurance, companies, pension, funds, corporations, charities, educational, establishments, or, private, investors, either, directly, via, investment, contracts, or, more, commonly, via, collective, investment, schemes, like, mutual, funds, exchange, traded, funds, or, reits, at, the, heart, of, investment, management, is, asset, allocation, diversifying, the, exposure, among, these, asset, classes, and, among, individual, securities, within, each, asset, class, as, appropriate, to, the, client, s, investment, policy, in, turn, a, function, of, risk, profile, investment, goals, and, investment, horizon, see, investor, profile, here, overlaid, is, the, portfolio, manager, s, investment, style, broadly, active, vs, passive, value, vs, growth, and, small, cap, vs, large, cap, and, investment, strategy, in, a, well, diversified, portfolio, achieved, investment, performance, will, in, general, largely, be, a, function, of, the, asset, mix, selected, while, the, individual, securities, are, less, impactful, the, specific, approach, or, philosophy, will, also, be, significant, depending, on, the, extent, to, which, it, is, complementary, with, the, market, cycle, risk, management, here, is, discussed, immediately, below, a, quantitative, fund, is, managed, using, computer, based, mathematical, techniques, increasingly, machine, learning, instead, of, human, judgment, the, actual, trading, is, typically, automated, via, sophisticated, algorithms, risk, management, in, general, is, the, study, of, how, to, control, risks, and, balance, the, possibility, of, gains, it, is, the, process, of, measuring, risk, and, then, developing, and, implementing, strategies, to, manage, that, risk, financial, risk, management, is, the, practice, of, protecting, corporate, value, against, financial, risks, often, by, hedging, exposure, to, these, using, financial, instruments, the, focus, is, particularly, on, credit, and, market, risk, and, in, banks, through, regulatory, capital, includes, operational, risk, financial, risk, management, is, related, to, corporate, finance, in, two, ways, firstly, firm, exposure, to, market, risk, is, a, direct, result, of, previous, capital, investments, and, funding, decisions, while, credit, risk, arises, from, the, business, s, credit, policy, and, is, often, addressed, through, credit, insurance, and, provisioning, secondly, both, disciplines, share, the, goal, of, enhancing, or, at, least, preserving, the, firm, s, economic, value, and, in, this, context, overlaps, also, enterprise, risk, management, typically, the, domain, of, strategic, management, here, businesses, devote, much, time, and, effort, to, forecasting, analytics, and, performance, monitoring, see, alm, and, treasury, management, for, banks, and, other, wholesale, institutions, risk, management, focuses, on, managing, and, as, necessary, hedging, the, various, positions, held, by, the, institution, both, trading, positions, and, long, term, exposures, and, on, calculating, and, monitoring, the, resultant, economic, capital, and, regulatory, capital, under, basel, iii, the, calculations, here, are, mathematically, sophisticated, and, within, the, domain, of, quantitative, finance, as, below, credit, risk, is, inherent, in, the, business, of, banking, but, additionally, these, institutions, are, exposed, to, counterparty, credit, risk, banks, typically, employ, middle, office, risk, groups, whereas, front, office, risk, teams, provide, risk, services, or, solutions, to, customers, additional, to, diversification, the, fundamental, feature, of, risk, mitigation, here, investment, managers, will, apply, various, hedging, techniques, as, appropriate, these, may, relate, to, the, portfolio, as, a, whole, or, to, individual, stocks, bond, portfolios, are, often, instead, managed, via, cash, flow, matching, or, immunization, while, for, derivative, portfolios, and, positions, traders, use, the, greeks, to, measure, and, then, offset, sensitivities, in, parallel, managers, active, and, passive, will, monitor, tracking, error, thereby, minimizing, and, preempting, any, underperformance, vs, their, benchmark, quantitative, finance, also, referred, to, as, mathematical, finance, includes, those, finance, activities, where, a, sophisticated, mathematical, model, is, required, and, thus, overlaps, several, of, the, above, as, a, specialized, practice, area, quantitative, finance, comprises, primarily, three, sub, disciplines, the, underlying, theory, and, techniques, are, discussed, in, the, next, section, dcf, valuation, formula, widely, applied, in, business, and, finance, since, articulated, in, 1938, here, to, get, the, value, of, the, firm, its, forecasted, free, cash, flows, are, discounted, to, the, present, using, the, weighted, average, cost, of, capital, for, the, discount, factor, for, share, valuation, investors, use, the, related, dividend, discount, model, financial, theory, is, studied, and, developed, within, the, disciplines, of, management, financial, economics, accountancy, and, applied, mathematics, abstractly, finance, is, concerned, with, the, investment, and, deployment, of, assets, and, liabilities, over, space, and, time, i, e, it, is, about, performing, valuation, and, asset, allocation, today, based, on, the, risk, and, uncertainty, of, future, outcomes, while, appropriately, incorporating, the, time, value, of, money, determining, the, present, value, of, these, future, values, discounting, must, be, at, the, risk, appropriate, discount, rate, in, turn, a, major, focus, of, finance, theory, as, financial, theory, has, roots, in, many, disciplines, including, mathematics, statistics, economics, physics, and, psychology, it, can, be, considered, a, mix, of, an, art, and, science, and, there, are, ongoing, related, efforts, to, organize, a, list, of, unsolved, problems, in, finance, managerial, finance, is, the, branch, of, finance, that, deals, with, the, financial, aspects, of, the, management, of, a, company, and, the, financial, dimension, of, managerial, decision, making, more, broadly, it, provides, the, theoretical, underpin, for, the, practice, described, above, concerning, itself, with, the, managerial, application, of, the, various, finance, techniques, academics, working, in, this, area, are, typically, based, in, business, school, finance, departments, in, accounting, or, in, management, science, the, tools, addressed, and, developed, relate, in, the, main, to, managerial, accounting, and, corporate, finance, the, former, allow, management, to, better, understand, and, hence, act, on, financial, information, relating, to, profitability, and, performance, the, latter, as, above, are, about, optimizing, the, overall, financial, structure, including, its, impact, on, working, capital, key, aspects, of, managerial, finance, thus, include, the, discussion, however, extends, to, business, strategy, more, broadly, emphasizing, alignment, with, the, company, s, overall, strategic, objectives, and, similarly, incorporates, the, managerial, perspectives, of, planning, directing, and, controlling, financial, economics, is, the, branch, of, economics, that, studies, the, interrelation, of, financial, variables, such, as, prices, interest, rates, and, shares, as, opposed, to, real, economic, variables, i, e, goods, and, services, it, thus, centers, on, pricing, decision, making, and, risk, management, in, the, financial, markets, and, produces, many, of, the, commonly, employed, financial, models, financial, econometrics, is, the, branch, of, financial, economics, that, uses, econometric, techniques, to, parameterize, the, relationships, suggested, the, discipline, has, two, main, areas, of, focus, asset, pricing, and, corporate, finance, the, first, being, the, perspective, of, providers, of, capital, i, e, investors, and, the, second, of, users, of, capital, respectively, financial, mathematics, is, the, field, of, applied, mathematics, concerned, with, financial, markets, louis, bachelier, s, doctoral, thesis, defended, in, 1900, is, considered, to, be, the, first, scholarly, work, in, this, area, the, field, is, largely, focused, on, the, modeling, of, derivatives, with, much, emphasis, on, interest, rate, and, credit, risk, modeling, while, other, important, areas, include, insurance, mathematics, and, quantitative, portfolio, management, relatedly, the, techniques, developed, are, applied, to, pricing, and, hedging, a, wide, range, of, asset, backed, government, and, corporate, securities, as, above, in, terms, of, practice, the, field, is, referred, to, as, quantitative, finance, and, or, mathematical, finance, and, comprises, primarily, the, three, areas, discussed, the, main, mathematical, tools, and, techniques, are, correspondingly, mathematically, these, separate, into, two, analytic, branches, derivatives, pricing, uses, risk, neutral, probability, or, arbitrage, pricing, probability, denoted, by, q, while, risk, and, portfolio, management, generally, use, physical, or, actual, or, actuarial, probability, denoted, by, p, these, are, interrelated, through, the, above, fundamental, theorem, of, asset, pricing, the, subject, has, a, close, relationship, with, financial, economics, which, as, outlined, is, concerned, with, much, of, the, underlying, theory, that, is, involved, in, financial, mathematics, generally, financial, mathematics, will, derive, and, extend, the, mathematical, models, suggested, computational, finance, is, the, branch, of, applied, computer, science, that, deals, with, problems, of, practical, interest, in, finance, and, especially, emphasizes, the, numerical, methods, applied, here, experimental, finance, aims, to, establish, different, market, settings, and, environments, to, experimentally, observe, and, provide, a, lens, through, which, science, can, analyze, agents, behavior, and, the, resulting, characteristics, of, trading, flows, information, diffusion, and, aggregation, price, setting, mechanisms, and, returns, processes, researchers, in, experimental, finance, can, study, to, what, extent, existing, financial, economics, theory, makes, valid, predictions, and, therefore, prove, them, as, well, as, attempt, to, discover, new, principles, on, which, such, theory, can, be, extended, and, be, applied, to, future, financial, decisions, research, may, proceed, by, conducting, trading, simulations, or, by, establishing, and, studying, the, behavior, of, people, in, artificial, competitive, market, like, settings, behavioral, finance, studies, how, the, psychology, of, investors, or, managers, affects, financial, decisions, and, markets, and, is, relevant, when, making, a, decision, that, can, impact, either, negatively, or, positively, on, one, of, their, areas, with, more, in, depth, research, into, behavioral, finance, it, is, possible, to, bridge, what, actually, happens, in, financial, markets, with, analysis, based, on, financial, theory, behavioral, finance, has, grown, over, the, last, few, decades, to, become, an, integral, aspect, of, finance, behavioral, finance, includes, such, topics, as, a, strand, of, behavioral, finance, has, been, dubbed, quantitative, behavioral, finance, which, uses, mathematical, and, statistical, methodology, to, understand, behavioral, biases, in, conjunction, with, valuation, quantum, finance, is, an, interdisciplinary, research, field, applying, theories, and, methods, developed, by, quantum, physicists, and, economists, in, order, to, solve, problems, in, finance, it, is, a, branch, of, econophysics, finance, theory, is, heavily, based, on, financial, instrument, pricing, such, as, stock, option, pricing, many, of, the, problems, facing, the, finance, community, have, no, known, analytical, solution, as, a, result, numerical, methods, and, computer, simulations, for, solving, these, problems, have, proliferated, this, research, area, is, known, as, computational, finance, many, computational, finance, problems, have, a, high, degree, of, computational, complexity, and, are, slow, to, converge, to, a, solution, on, classical, computers, in, particular, when, it, comes, to, option, pricing, there, is, additional, complexity, resulting, from, the, need, to, respond, to, quickly, changing, markets, for, example, in, order, to, take, advantage, of, inaccurately, priced, stock, options, the, computation, must, complete, before, the, next, change, in, the, almost, continuously, changing, stock, market, as, a, result, the, finance, community, is, always, looking, for, ways, to, overcome, the, resulting, performance, issues, that, arise, when, pricing, options, this, has, led, to, research, that, applies, alternative, computing, techniques, to, finance, most, commonly, used, quantum, financial, models, are, quantum, continuous, model, quantum, binomial, model, multi, step, quantum, binomial, model, etc, the, origin, of, finance, can, be, traced, to, the, beginning, of, state, formation, and, trade, during, the, bronze, age, the, earliest, historical, evidence, of, finance, is, dated, to, around, 3000, bce, banking, originated, in, west, asia, where, temples, and, palaces, were, used, as, safe, places, for, the, storage, of, valuables, initially, the, only, valuable, that, could, be, deposited, was, grain, but, cattle, and, precious, materials, were, eventually, included, during, the, same, period, the, sumerian, city, of, uruk, in, mesopotamia, supported, trade, by, lending, as, well, as, the, use, of, interest, in, sumerian, interest, was, mas, which, translates, to, calf, in, greece, and, egypt, the, words, used, for, interest, tokos, and, ms, respectively, meant, to, give, birth, in, these, cultures, interest, indicated, a, valuable, increase, and, seemed, to, consider, it, from, the, lender, s, point, of, view, the, code, of, hammurabi, 1792, 1750, bce, included, laws, governing, banking, operations, the, babylonians, were, accustomed, to, charging, interest, at, the, rate, of, 20, percent, per, year, by, 1200, bce, cowrie, shells, were, used, as, a, form, of, money, in, china, the, use, of, coins, as, a, means, of, representing, money, began, in, the, years, between, 700, and, 500, bce, herodotus, mentions, the, use, of, crude, coins, in, lydia, around, 687, bce, and, by, 640, bce, the, lydians, had, started, to, use, coin, money, more, widely, and, opened, permanent, retail, shops, shortly, after, cities, in, classical, greece, such, as, aegina, athens, and, corinth, started, minting, their, own, coins, between, 595, and, 570, bce, during, the, roman, republic, interest, was, outlawed, by, the, lex, genucia, reforms, in, 342, bce, though, the, provision, went, largely, unenforced, under, julius, caesar, a, ceiling, on, interest, rates, of, 12, was, set, and, much, later, under, justinian, it, was, lowered, even, further, to, between, 4, and, 8, the, first, exchange, happened, in, belgium, in, 1531, since, then, popular, exchanges, such, as, the, london, stock, exchange, founded, in, 1773, and, the, new, york, stock, exchange, founded, in, 1793, were, created
