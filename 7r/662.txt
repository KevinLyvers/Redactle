classes, in, the, 18th, century, according, to, one, study, the, qing, dynasty, had, the, most, elaborate, relief, system, in, world, history, based, on, state, and, local, granaries, that, were, used, in, times, of, shortage, to, stabilize, food, prices, and, provide, relief, to, the, urban, and, rural, poor, this, system, however, was, weakened, after, imperialism, entered, china, following, the, 1840, opium, war, and, the, taiping, rebellion, 1850, 1860, which, resulted, in, a, crisis, in, the, qing, dynasty, following, the, foundation, of, the, republic, in, 1912, and, the, following,

to, the, needy, directly, instead, to, maximize, its, impact, likewise, in, jewish, tradition, charity, represented, by, tzedakah, is, a, matter, of, religious, obligation, rather, than, benevolence, contemporary, charity, is, regarded, as, a, continuation, of, the, biblical, maaser, ani, or, poor, tithe, as, well, as, biblical, practices, such, as, permitting, the, poor, to, glean, the, corners,

of, the, working, population, in, part, due, to, reliance, on, the, informal, economy, additionally, the, state, s, capacity, to, reach, people, may, be, limited, because, of, its, limited, infrastructure, and, resources, in, this, context, social, protection, is, often, referred, to, instead, of, social, security, encompassing, a, broader, set, of, means, such, as, labour, market, intervention, and, local, community, based, programs, to, alleviate, poverty, and, provide, security, against, things, like, unemployment, prior, to, 1900, in, australia, charitable, assistance, from,

depression, and, the, rise, of, the, trade, unions, and, the, labor, parties, during, this, period, led, to, a, movement, for, welfare, reform, in, 1900, the, states, of, new, south, wales, and, victoria, enacted, legislation, introducing, non, contributory, pensions, for, those, aged, 65, and, over, queensland, legislated, a, similar, system, in, 1907, before, the, australian, labor,

to, direct, payments, to, poor, individuals, as, in, the, american, usage, and, not, to, healthcare, and, education, spending, as, in, the, european, usage, the, canadian, social, safety, net, covers, a, broad, spectrum, of, programs, and, because, canada, is, a, federation, many, are, run, by, the, provinces, canada, has, a, wide, range, of, government, transfer, payments, to, individuals, which, totaled, 145, billion, in, 2006, only, social, programs, that, direct, funds, to, individuals, are, included, in, that, cost, programs, such, as, medicare, and, public, education, are, additional,

human, capital, than, in, bringing, households, above, the, poverty, line, challenges, still, exist, including, the, extreme, inequality, levels, and, the, mass, scale, of, poverty, locating, a, financial, basis, for, programs, and, deciding, on, exit, strategies, or, on, the, long, term, establishment, of, programs, the, economic, crisis, of, the, 1980s, led, to, a, shift, in, social, policies, as, understandings, of, poverty, and, social, programs, evolved, 24, new, mostly, short, term, programs, emerged, these, include, new, zealand, is, often, regarded, as, having, one, of, the, first, comprehensive, welfare, systems, in, the, world, during, the, 1890s, a, liberal, government, adopted, many, social, programmes, to, help, the, poor, who, had, suffered, from, a, long, economic, depression, in, the, 1880s, one, of, the, most, far, reaching, was, the, passing, of, tax, legislation, that, made, it, difficult, for, wealthy, sheep, farmers, to, hold, onto, their, large, land, holdings, this, and, the, invention, of, refrigeration, led, to, a, farming, revolution, where, many, sheep, farms, were, broken, up, and, sold, to, become, smaller, dairy, farms, this, enabled, thousands, of, new, farmers, to, buy, land, and, develop, a, new, and, vigorous, industry, that, has, become, the, backbone, of, new, zealand, s, economy, to, this, day, this, liberal, tradition, flourished, with, increased, enfranchisement, for, indigenous, m, ori, in, the, 1880s, and, women, pensions, for, the, elderly, the, poor, and, war, casualties, followed, with, state, run, schools, hospitals, and, subsidized, medical, and, dental, care, by, 1960, new, zealand, was, able, to, afford, one, of, the, best, developed, and, most, comprehensive, welfare, systems, in, the, world, supported, by, a, well, developed, and, stable, economy, norway, has, a, strong, welfare, state, that, provides, a, range, of, social, services, and, financial, assistance, to, its, citizens, the, norwegian, welfare, state, is, based, on, the, principles, of, social, democracy, which, means, that, it, has, a, strong, focus, on, reducing, income, inequality, and, promoting, social, cohesion, the, norwegian, welfare, state, provides, a, range, of, services, including, universal, healthcare, free, education, and, a, comprehensive, system, of, social, security, it, also, provides, financial, assistance, to, citizens, in, need, through, programs, such, as, unemployment, benefits, housing, assistance, and, social, assistance, for, low, income, families, in, philippines, social, welfare, is, divided, into, two, the, first, one, is, called, social, security, system, sss, and, the, other, one, is, called, government, service, insurance, system, gsis, social, security, system, or, sss, is, a, social, insurance, program, for, workers, in, private, sector, individuals, who, are, self, employed, or, not, working, can, also, apply, to, be, protected, under, sss, programme, sss, provide, benefits, for, unemployment, death, funeral, maternity, leave, disabilities, and, many, more, members, of, sss, who, experienced, accident, or, death, due, to, work, activity, can, also, claim, for, double, compensation, under, the, employees, compensation, ec, programme, sss, also, allows, its, members, to, apply, for, salary, loans, based, on, their, monthly, salary, and, calamity, loan, if, their, place, is, declared, as, state, of, calamity, by, the, government, sss, also, have, two, voluntary, saving, programs, peso, fund, and, flexi, fund, to, help, prepare, their, members, with, a, stable, income, for, retirement, government, servants, are, protected, under, the, government, service, insurance, system, or, gsis, just, like, sss, gsis, also, provide, their, members, with, retirement, benefits, life, insurance, and, employee, compensation, the, polish, welfare, state, provides, a, range, of, services, including, universal, healthcare, free, education, and, a, comprehensive, system, of, social, security, it, also, provides, financial, assistance, to, citizens, in, need, through, programs, such, as, unemployment, benefits, housing, assistance, and, social, assistance, for, low, income, families, it, has, undergone, significant, changes, in, recent, years, including, the, implementation, of, structural, reforms, and, the, introduction, of, market, oriented, policies, which, have, had, an, impact, on, the, level, and, quality, of, social, services, provided, sri, lanka, has, a, long, history, of, social, programmes, dating, back, to, its, ancient, times, deep, rooted, in, the, island, s, buddhist, culture, modern, social, welfare, legislation, dates, back, to, the, donoughmore, constitution, welfare, in, spain, is, characterized, by, a, mediterranean, welfare, state, model, based, on, three, pillars, education, health, and, pensions, as, in, most, european, countries, in, spain, the, welfare, state, is, a, great, achievement, for, its, society, since, the, state, guarantees, protection, to, all, people, who, may, find, themselves, in, a, situation, of, economic, difficulty, or, any, other, the, social, policies, implemented, by, the, spanish, state, as, in, the, rest, of, europe, are, a, set, of, measures, and, tools, aimed, at, protecting, and, ensuring, basic, human, needs, especially, in, the, field, of, education, health, and, economic, security, the, mediterranean, welfare, state, model, is, found, not, only, in, spain, but, also, in, countries, such, as, italy, greece, and, portugal, countries, in, the, mediterranean, region, where, social, protection, arrived, late, in, the, 70s, and, 80s, of, the, 20th, century, it, is, a, model, that, mixes, elements, of, the, liberal, or, anglo, saxon, and, continental, or, bismarckian, welfare, state, it, is, characterized, as, the, welfare, model, with, the, lowest, spending, with, little, investment, in, social, assistance, a, more, fragmented, social, security, system, and, high, spending, on, pensions, making, pension, benefits, greater, than, unemployment, benefits, one, of, the, most, particular, features, of, the, mediterranean, model, is, the, large, role, of, the, family, which, combines, with, the, market, and, the, state, in, the, provision, of, welfare, thus, the, state, assumes, that, the, family, covers, certain, services, such, as, childcare, or, care, for, the, elderly, which, in, other, models, would, be, covered, by, the, state, as, for, the, labor, market, it, is, characterized, by, high, employment, protection, the, persistence, of, gender, biases, and, a, lower, dispersion, of, workers, wages, due, to, the, importance, of, trade, unions, in, negotiations, the, spanish, social, welfare, program, can, be, separated, into, three, categories, or, fundamental, pillars, education, health, and, pension, system, as, established, in, the, spanish, constitution, ratified, on, december, 29, 1978, it, relies, especially, on, article, 27, on, education, article, 41, on, the, social, security, system, and, article, 50, on, the, pension, system, the, beginnings, of, the, spanish, welfare, state, date, back, to, the, last, decade, of, dictatorship, francoist, spain, when, it, began, to, develop, through, the, social, security, law, of, 1963, later, after, the, death, of, the, dictator, francisco, franco, and, with, the, arrival, of, democracy, it, would, be, when, the, existence, of, public, needs, not, covered, by, the, state, became, evident, and, when, education, health, and, social, services, were, universalized, this, advance, of, the, welfare, state, was, also, marked, by, the, economic, crisis, which, led, to, a, deterioration, of, the, labor, market, and, highlighted, the, need, to, increase, public, spending, to, offer, greater, protection, to, the, retired, and, unemployed, social, policies, in, spain, constitute, a, set, of, legislation, decisions, and, activities, that, seek, to, promote, the, welfare, of, all, spaniards, and, improve, their, quality, of, life, facilitating, access, to, society, s, goods, and, resources, to, cover, their, basic, needs, and, respond, to, complex, situations, that, citizens, may, face, these, policies, are, governed, by, the, principles, of, equality, and, equity, the, social, policies, of, the, spanish, state, like, those, of, most, countries, in, the, world, are, in, line, with, the, un, sustainable, development, goals, and, as, the, rest, of, the, european, welfare, states, also, depend, on, the, guidelines, of, a, higher, body, the, european, union, among, these, policies, are, those, oriented, towards, healthcare, social, welfare, policies, to, prevent, and, end, poverty, free, education, social, security, policies, security, and, justice, policies, or, access, to, housing, free, public, health, care, policies, are, aimed, at, improving, people, s, living, conditions, and, provide, the, medical, and, pharmaceutical, services, necessary, to, protect, and, restore, the, health, of, the, insured, health, care, is, one, of, the, benefits, universally, recognized, for, all, citizens, education, is, another, of, the, pillars, of, spanish, welfare, educational, policies, are, focused, on, guaranteeing, access, to, the, entire, population, without, any, kind, of, discrimination, to, free, and, compulsory, general, basic, education, from, the, age, of, 6, to, 16, after, that, citizens, can, also, have, free, access, to, high, school, and, vocational, training, university, studies, although, not, free, are, also, financed, by, the, spanish, state, the, educational, model, has, a, decentralized, character, and, the, competences, functions, services, and, resources, in, the, field, of, education, have, been, transferred, from, the, central, government, to, the, different, spanish, autonomous, communities, in, both, university, and, non, university, matters, finally, the, third, pillar, of, the, spanish, welfare, state, is, the, pension, system, the, spanish, pension, system, includes, a, wide, variety, of, pensions, including, widow, s, pensions, contributory, pensions, and, non, contributory, pensions, the, widow, s, pension, covers, people, who, suffer, the, death, of, their, spouse, contributory, pensions, are, transfers, from, the, state, that, depend, on, the, worker, s, previous, contribution, and, vary, according, to, the, number, of, years, worked, and, the, worker, s, contribution, non, contributory, pensions, on, the, other, hand, have, a, welfare, character, and, cover, people, for, disability, or, retirement, if, they, have, not, contributed, enough, to, qualify, for, a, contributory, pension, this, public, pension, model, is, often, supported, by, a, private, dimension, formed, by, pension, plans, to, which, workers, contribute, a, percentage, of, their, salary, during, their, working, life, to, receive, a, larger, pension, during, their, retirement, in, spain, the, welfare, state, is, considered, to, be, very, scarce, and, less, developed, especially, compared, to, the, european, union, average, where, social, policies, and, the, welfare, state, are, strongly, developed, spain, lags, behind, eu, values, in, social, protection, spending, measured, both, as, a, percentage, of, gdp, and, in, absolute, terms, and, in, the, proportion, of, adults, working, in, state, services, however, public, spending, in, general, compared, to, the, rest, of, the, world, is, very, high, moreover, the, spanish, welfare, state, is, polarized, which, means, that, the, higher, income, groups, use, private, services, especially, in, health, and, education, while, the, lower, income, groups, use, public, services, the, spanish, state, s, low, investment, in, public, spending, affects, the, quality, of, its, services, as, for, healthcare, almost, all, healthcare, competencies, have, been, transferred, from, the, state, to, the, autonomous, communities, public, health, spending, is, below, the, average, of, the, european, union, in, 2020, it, was, around, 8, of, gdp, or, 1907, per, capita, while, the, european, union, average, stood, at, 2, 244, per, capita, it, is, even, more, worrying, when, the, spending, figure, is, separated, between, what, is, invested, in, healthcare, as, such, and, what, is, invested, in, the, pharmaceutical, industry, this, ends, up, causing, a, great, lack, of, resources, and, deficiencies, in, the, spanish, healthcare, system, such, as, long, waiting, lists, even, for, life, threatening, operations, scarce, primary, care, etc, these, deficiencies, have, accentuated, the, polarization, of, the, welfare, state, and, have, made, the, private, sector, acquire, great, importance, in, spanish, healthcare, becoming, more, similar, to, the, healthcare, systems, in, latin, america, than, in, europe, education, is, another, of, the, pillars, that, support, the, spanish, welfare, state, but, it, also, has, a, polarizing, character, in, society, the, low, state, investment, in, public, education, has, led, to, an, increase, in, the, number, of, private, and, charter, schools, that, have, greater, resources, and, create, inequality, in, basic, compulsory, education, social, welfare, in, sweden, is, made, up, of, several, organizations, and, systems, dealing, with, welfare, it, is, mostly, funded, by, taxes, and, executed, by, the, public, sector, on, all, levels, of, government, as, well, as, private, organizations, it, can, be, separated, into, three, parts, falling, under, three, different, ministries, social, welfare, falling, under, the, responsibility, of, ministry, of, health, and, social, affairs, education, under, the, responsibility, of, the, ministry, of, education, and, research, and, labor, market, under, the, responsibility, of, ministry, of, employment, government, pension, payments, are, financed, through, an, 18, 5, pension, tax, on, all, taxed, incomes, in, the, country, which, comes, partly, from, a, tax, category, called, a, public, pension, fee, 7, on, gross, income, and, 30, of, a, tax, category, called, employer, fees, on, salaries, which, is, 33, on, a, netted, income, since, january, 2001, the, 18, 5, is, divided, in, two, parts, 16, goes, to, current, payments, and, 2, 5, goes, into, individual, retirement, accounts, which, were, introduced, in, 2001, money, saved, and, invested, in, government, funds, and, iras, for, future, pension, costs, are, roughly, five, times, annual, government, pension, expenses, 725, 150, viewing, swedish, welfare, more, broadly, it, emerges, as, highly, rated, in, many, standard, international, comparisons, of, welfare, or, well, being, e, g, world, economic, forum, 2020, however, some, nordic, based, welfare, and, gender, researchers, have, argued, that, such, assessments, based, on, conventional, welfare, well, being, criteria, may, to, some, extent, over, privilege, sweden, and, other, nordic, countries, in, terms, of, for, instance, gender, and, racial, equality, for, example, they, suggest, that, if, one, takes, a, broader, perspective, on, well, being, incorporating, issues, associated, with, bodily, integrity, or, bodily, citizenship, pringle, 2011, then, some, major, forms, of, men, s, domination, and, or, white, privilege, can, be, seen, to, still, stubbornly, persist, in, the, nordic, countries, e, g, business, violence, to, women, sexual, violence, to, children, the, military, academia, and, religion, hearn, and, pringle, 2006, hearn, et, al, 2018, pringle, 2016, the, united, kingdom, has, a, long, history, of, welfare, notably, including, the, english, poor, laws, which, date, back, to, 1536, after, various, reforms, to, the, program, which, involved, workhouses, it, was, eventually, abolished, and, replaced, with, a, modern, system, by, laws, such, as, the, national, assistance, act, 1948, 11, 12, geo, 6, c, 29, in, more, recent, times, comparing, the, cameron, clegg, coalition, s, austerity, measures, with, the, opposition, s, the, financial, times, commentator, martin, wolf, commented, that, the, big, shift, from, labour, is, the, cuts, in, welfare, benefits, the, government, s, austerity, programme, which, involves, reduction, in, government, policy, has, been, linked, to, a, rise, in, food, banks, a, study, published, in, the, british, medical, journal, in, 2015, found, that, each, one, percentage, point, increase, in, the, rate, of, jobseeker, s, allowance, claimants, sanctioned, was, associated, with, a, 0, 09, percentage, point, rise, in, food, bank, use, the, austerity, programme, has, faced, opposition, from, disability, rights, groups, for, disproportionately, affecting, disabled, people, the, bedroom, tax, is, an, austerity, measure, that, has, attracted, particular, criticism, with, activists, arguing, that, two, thirds, of, council, houses, affected, by, the, policy, are, occupied, with, a, person, with, a, disability, in, the, united, states, depending, on, the, context, the, term, welfare, can, be, used, to, refer, to, means, tested, cash, benefits, especially, the, aid, to, families, with, dependent, children, afdc, program, and, its, successor, the, temporary, assistance, for, needy, families, block, grants, or, it, can, be, used, to, refer, to, all, means, tested, programs, that, help, individuals, or, families, meet, basic, needs, including, for, example, health, care, through, medicaid, supplemental, security, income, ssi, benefits, and, food, and, nutrition, programs, snap, it, can, also, include, social, insurance, programs, such, as, unemployment, insurance, social, security, and, medicare, afdc, originally, called, aid, to, dependent, children, was, created, during, the, great, depression, to, alleviate, the, burden, of, poverty, for, families, with, children, and, allow, widowed, mothers, to, maintain, their, households, the, new, deal, employment, program, such, as, the, works, progress, administration, primarily, served, men, prior, to, the, new, deal, anti, poverty, programs, were, primarily, operated, by, private, charities, or, state, or, local, governments, however, these, programs, were, overwhelmed, by, the, depth, of, need, during, the, depression, until, early, in, the, year, 1965, the, news, media, conveyed, the, idea, that, only, white, people, lived, in, poverty, but, then, black, people, were, presented, more, often, than, white, people, in, this, plight, some, of, the, influences, on, this, shift, may, have, been, the, civil, rights, movement, and, urban, riots, from, the, mid, 1960s, welfare, had, by, then, shifted, from, being, a, white, issue, to, being, a, black, issue, and, during, this, time, frame, the, war, on, poverty, had, already, begun, subsequently, news, media, portrayed, stereotypes, of, black, people, as, lazy, and, undeserving, and, as, welfare, queens, these, shifts, in, media, presentation, did, not, necessarily, reflect, a, decrease, in, the, percentage, of, the, population, living, in, poverty, in, 1996, the, personal, responsibility, and, work, opportunity, reconciliation, act, changed, the, structure, of, welfare, payments, and, added, new, criteria, to, states, that, received, welfare, funding, after, reforms, that, president, clinton, said, would, end, welfare, as, we, know, it, amounts, from, the, federal, government, were, given, out, in, a, flat, rate, per, state, based, on, population, each, state, must, meet, certain, criteria, to, ensure, recipients, are, being, encouraged, to, work, themselves, out, of, welfare, the, new, program, is, called, temporary, assistance, for, needy, families, tanf, it, encourages, states, to, require, some, sort, of, employment, search, in, exchange, for, providing, funds, to, individuals, and, imposes, a, five, year, lifetime, limit, on, cash, assistance, in, fy, 2010, 31, 8, of, tanf, families, were, white, 31, 9, were, african, american, and, 30, 0, were, hispanic, according, to, the, u, s, census, bureau, data, released, 13, september, 2011, the, nation, s, poverty, rate, rose, to, 15, 1, 46, 2, million, in, 2010, up, from, 14, 3, approximately, 43, 6, million, in, 2009, and, to, its, highest, level, since, 1993, in, 2008, 13, 2, 39, 8, million, americans, lived, in, relative, poverty, in, a, 2011, op, ed, in, forbes, peter, ferrara, stated, that, the, best, estimate, of, the, cost, of, the, 185, federal, means, tested, welfare, programs, for, 2010, for, the, federal, government, alone, is, nearly, 700, billion, up, a, third, since, 2008, according, to, the, heritage, foundation, counting, state, spending, total, welfare, spending, for, 2010, reached, nearly, 900, billion, up, nearly, one, fourth, since, 2008, 24, 3, california, with, 12, of, the, u, s, population, has, one, third, of, the, nation, s, welfare, recipients, the, united, states, has, also, typically, relied, on, charitable, giving, through, non, profit, agencies, and, fundraising, instead, of, direct, monetary, assistance, from, the, government, itself, according, to, giving, usa, americans, gave, 358, 38, billion, to, charity, in, 2014, this, is, rewarded, by, the, united, states, government, through, tax, credits, for, individuals, and, companies, that, are, not, typically, seen, in, other, countries, since, these, per, capita, charity, sums, are, much, higher, than, in, all, other, countries, this, means, that, private, people, and, companies, have, a, strong, say, in, how, social, assistance, is, carried, out, this, means, that, public, funds, in, the, form, of, unpaid, taxes, are, distributed, according, to, less, professional, less, objective, and, less, unbiased, criteria, than, in, all, other, countries, the, welfare, to, work, intervention, programme, is, unlikely, to, have, any, impacts, on, the, mental, and, physical, health, of, lone, parents, and, children, even, when, the, employment, and, income, rates, were, higher, in, this, group, of, people, the, poverty, rate, was, high, which, could, lead, to, persistently, high, rates, of, depression, whether, they, were, in, the, programme, or, not, income, transfers, can, be, either, conditional, or, unconditional, conditionalities, are, sometimes, criticized, as, being, paternalistic, and, unnecessary, and, research, in, different, contexts, shows, enforcing, conditionalities, can, result, in, additional, burdens, for, recipients, and, social, service, providers, a, 2008, study, by, welfare, economist, and, brown, university, professor, allan, m, feldman, suggests, that, welfare, can, achieve, both, competitive, equilibrium, and, pareto, efficiency, in, the, market, although, different, points, of, pareto, efficiency, are, more, fair, to, some, than, others, some, opponents, of, welfare, argue, that, it, affects, work, incentives, according, to, a, 2012, review, study, whether, a, welfare, program, generates, public, support, depends, on, everyone, as, a, member, of, society, has, the, right, to, social, security, and, is, entitled, to, realization, through, national, effort, and, international, co, operation, and, in, accordance, with, the, organization, and, resources, of, each, state, of, the, economic, social, and, cultural, rights, indispensable, for, his, dignity, and, the, free, development, of, his, personality, everyone, has, the, right, to, a, standard, of, living, adequate, for, the, health, and, well, being, of, himself, and, of, his, family, including, food, clothing, housing, and, medical, care, and, necessary, social, services, and, the, right, to, security, in, the, event, of, unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old, age, or, other, lack, of, livelihood, in, circumstances, beyond, his, control
