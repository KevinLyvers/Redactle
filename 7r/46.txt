exemption, of, certain, goods, or, services, from, sales, and, use, tax, such, as, food, education, and, medicines, a, value, added, tax, vat, collected, on, goods, and, services, is, related, to, a, sales, tax, see, comparison, with, sales, tax, for, key, differences, conventional, or, retail, sales, tax, is, levied, on, the, sale, of, a, good, to, its, final, end, user, and, is, charged, every, time, that, item, is, sold, retail, sales, to, businesses, that, later, resell, the, goods, are, not, charged, the, tax, a, purchaser, who, is, not, an, end, user, is, usually, issued, a, resale, certificate, by, the, taxing, authority, and, required, to, provide, the, certificate, or, its, id, number, to, a, seller, at, the, point, of, purchase, along, with, a, statement, that, the, item, is, for, resale, the, tax, is, otherwise, charged, on, each, item, sold, to, purchasers, without, such, a, certificate, and, who, are, under, the, jurisdiction, of, the, taxing, authority, other, types, of, sales, taxes, or, similar, taxes, most, countries, in, the, world, have, sales, taxes, or, value, added, taxes, at, all, or, several, of, the, national, state, county, or, city, government, levels, countries, in, western, europe, especially, in, scandinavia, have, some, of, the, world, s, highest, valued, added, taxes, norway, denmark, and, sweden, have, higher, vats, at, 25, hungary, has, the, highest, at, 27, although, reduced, rates, are, used, in, some, cases, as, for, groceries, art, books, and, newspapers, in, some, jurisdictions, of, the, united, states, there, are, multiple, levels, of, government, which, each, impose, a, sales, tax, for, example, sales, tax, in, chicago, cook, county, il, is, 10, 25, consisting, of, 6, 25, state, 1, 25, city, 1, 75, county, and, 1, regional, transportation, authority, chicago, also, has, the, metropolitan, pier, and, exposition, authority, tax, on, food, and, beverage, of, 1, which, means, eating, out, is, taxed, at, 11,

made, up, of, various, state, county, and, city, taxes, the, state, tax, is, imposed, upon, all, retailers, for, the, privilege, of, selling, tangible, personal, property, at, retail, strictly, speaking, only, the, retailer, is, responsible, for, the, payment, of, the, tax, when, a, retailer, adds, this, tax, to, the, purchase, price, the, consumer, is, merely, reimbursing, the, retailer, by, contractual, agreement, when, consumers, purchase, goods, from, out, of, state, in, which, case, the, seller, owes, no, tax, to, california, the, consumer, is, required, to, pay, a, use, tax, identical, to, the, sales, tax, use, tax, is, levied, upon, the, storage, use, or, other, consumption, in, this, state, of, tangible, personal, property, consumers, are, responsible, for, declaring, these, purchases, in, the, same, filing, as, their, annual, state, income, tax, but, it, is, rare, for, them, to, do, so, an, exception, is, out, of, state, purchase, of, automobiles, then, use, tax, is, collected, by, the, state, as, part, of, registering, the, vehicle, in, california, the, trend, has, been, for, conventional, sales, taxes, to, be, replaced, by, more, broadly, based, value, added, taxes, value, added, taxes, provide, an, estimated, 20, of, worldwide, tax, revenue, and, have, been, adopted, by, more, than, 140, countries, the, united, states, is, now, one, of, the, few, countries, to, retain, conventional, sales, taxes, sales, tax, on, online, purchasers, operates, in, a, different, manner, generally, there, are, four, types, of, electronic, commerce, intermediaries, retail, business, to, business, and, media, all, of, which, are, affected, by, consumer, response, to, sales, tax, however, while, consumers, are, technically, supposed, to, pay, a, sales, tax, when, it, comes, to, cross, state, border, transactions, the, practicality, of, enforcing, it, is, impossible, as, a, result, online, retail, stores, have, had, a, distinct, advantage, in, that, they, do, not, have, to, charge, a, sales, tax, that, has, led, many, economists, to, examine, consumer, sensitivity, when, it, comes, to, sales, taxes, while, some, researchers, have, concluded, a, high, elasticity, of, online, purchase, probability, with, respect, to, sales, tax, at, around, 2, 3, but, others, have, found, smaller, figures, of, around, 0, 5, that, means, that, enforcing, an, online, sales, tax, would, have, negligible, effects, on, aggregate, sales, economists, at, the, organisation, for, economic, co, operation, and, development, studied, the, effects, of, various, types, of, taxes, on, the, economic, growth, of, developed, nations, within, the, oecd, and, found, that, sales, taxes, are, one, of, the, least, harmful, taxes, for, growth, because, the, rate, of, a, sales, tax, does, not, change, based, on, a, person, s, income, or, wealth, sales, taxes, are, generally, considered, regressive, however, it, has, been, suggested, that, any, regressive, effect, of, a, sales, tax, could, be, mitigated, e, g, by, excluding, rent, or, by, exempting, necessary, items, such, as, food, clothing, and, medicines, investopedia, defines, a, regressive, tax, as, tax, that, takes, a, larger, percentage, from, low, income, people, than, from, high, income, people, a, regressive, tax, is, generally, a, tax, that, is, applied, uniformly, this, means, that, it, hits, lower, income, individuals, harder, higher, sales, taxes, have, been, shown, to, have, many, different, effects, on, local, economies, with, higher, taxes, more, consumers, are, starting, to, reconsider, where, they, shop, according, to, a, study, conducted, in, minnesota, and, wisconsin, where, the, sales, tax, was, raised, on, cigarettes, effects, of, higher, sales, tax, were, not, shown, immediately, in, sales, but, about, six, months, after, the, taxes, were, raised, high, sales, taxes, can, be, used, to, relieve, property, taxes, but, only, when, property, taxes, are, lowered, subsequently, studies, that, have, shown, this, correlation, were, conducted, in, georgia, by, cities, raising, sales, tax, and, lowering, property, taxes, to, combat, sales, loss, a, city, must, be, able, to, import, consumers, to, buy, goods, locally, if, local, sales, taxes, are, too, high, consumers, will, travel, to, other, areas, to, purchase, goods, in, the, united, states, every, state, with, a, sales, tax, law, has, a, use, tax, component, in, that, law, applying, to, purchases, from, out, of, state, mail, order, catalog, and, e, commerce, vendors, a, category, also, known, as, remote, sales, as, e, commerce, sales, have, grown, in, recent, years, noncompliance, with, use, tax, has, had, a, growing, impact, on, state, revenues, the, congressional, budget, office, estimated, that, uncollected, use, taxes, on, remote, sales, in, 2003, could, be, as, high, as, 20, 4, billion, uncollected, use, tax, on, remote, sales, was, projected, to, run, as, high, as, 54, 8, billion, for, 2011, enforcement, of, the, tax, on, remote, sales, however, is, difficult, unless, the, vendor, has, a, physical, location, or, nexus, within, a, state, the, vendor, cannot, be, required, to, collect, tax, for, that, state, this, limitation, was, defined, as, part, of, the, dormant, commerce, clause, by, the, supreme, court, in, the, 1967, decision, on, national, bellas, hess, v, illinois, an, attempt, to, require, a, delaware, e, commerce, vendor, to, collect, north, dakota, tax, was, overturned, by, the, court, in, the, 1992, decision, on, quill, corp, v, north, dakota, a, number, of, observers, and, commentators, have, argued, so, far, unsuccessfully, for, a, congressional, adoption, of, this, physical, presence, nexus, test, the, internet, tax, freedom, act, of, 1998, established, a, commission, to, study, the, possibility, of, internet, taxation, but, the, commission, did, not, make, any, formal, recommendations, in, a, report, issued, in, 2003, the, congressional, budget, office, warned, of, the, economic, burden, of, a, multiplicity, of, tax, systems, particularly, for, smaller, firms, in, an, effort, to, reduce, the, burden, of, compliance, with, the, tax, laws, of, multiple, jurisdictions, the, streamlined, sales, tax, project, was, organized, in, march, 2000, cooperative, efforts, in, this, project, by, 44, state, governments, and, the, district, of, columbia, eventually, produced, the, streamlined, sales, and, use, tax, agreement, in, 2010, this, agreement, establishes, standards, necessary, for, simplified, and, uniform, sales, tax, laws, as, of, december, 2010, 24, states, had, passed, legislation, conforming, with, the, agreement, whether, the, streamlined, sales, tax, can, actually, be, applied, to, remote, sales, ultimately, depends, upon, congressional, support, because, the, 1992, quill, v, north, dakota, decision, determined, that, only, the, u, s, congress, has, the, authority, to, enact, interstate, taxes, electronic, commerce, business, can, also, be, affected, by, consumption, taxes, it, can, be, separated, into, four, categories, retail, intermediaries, business, to, business, and, media, goldfarb, 2008, these, categories, were, affected, varying, degrees, the, intermediaries, were, affected, by, the, retail, sales, tax, since, it, provides, platforms, for, transitions, between, different, parties, such, as, the, amazon, marketplace, business, to, business, transactions, will, be, placed, in, different, circumstances, by, whether, the, case, will, be, taxed, in, the, us, electronic, commerce, goods, are, usually, not, taxed, the, same, especially, across, the, stats, in, the, us, different, states, have, their, own, sales, tax, regulations, for, example, some, states, use, their, standard, sales, taxes, law, for, the, digital, goods, and, some, of, the, states, have, specific, laws, for, them, it, is, difficult, to, enforce, the, taxes, on, electronic, commerce, especially, for, digital, goods, that, trade, across, different, countries, the, effect, that, a, sales, tax, has, on, consumer, and, producer, behavior, is, rather, large, the, price, elasticity, of, demand, for, online, products, is, high, meaning, that, consumers, are, price, sensitive, and, their, demand, will, significantly, change, with, small, changes, in, price, this, means, that, the, tax, burden, lies, primarily, with, the, producer, to, avoid, altering, demand, the, producer, will, either, avoid, the, tax, if, possible, by, relocating, their, fulfillment, centers, to, areas, without, a, high, sales, tax, or, they, will, internalize, the, cost, of, the, sales, tax, by, charging, consumers, the, same, price, but, paying, for, the, tax, from, their, profits, a, tax, imposed, on, the, sale, of, goods, is, depicted, on, the, walls, of, ancient, egyptian, tombs, which, have, been, dated, as, far, back, as, 2000, bc, these, paintings, describe, the, collection, of, tax, for, specific, commodities, such, as, cooking, oil, sales, tax, amounts, measured, in, drachmas, at, a, rate, of, one, percent, were, recorded, in, a, separate, column, of, a, record, prepared, for, the, auction, of, 16, slaves, in, piraeus, greece, in, 415, bc, nearby, athens, collected, duties, on, the, import, and, export, of, commodities, recorded, at, a, rate, of, two, percent, in, 399, bc, at, that, period, of, time, athens, did, not, rely, on, government, agencies, to, collect, its, taxes, the, responsibility, was, delegated, to, the, highest, bidder, a, practice, known, as, tax, farming, the, roman, emperor, augustus, collected, funds, for, his, military, aerarium, in, ad, 6, with, a, one, percent, general, sales, tax, known, as, the, centesima, rerum, venalium, hundredth, of, the, value, of, everything, sold, the, roman, sales, tax, was, later, reduced, to, a, half, percent, ducentesima, by, tiberius, then, abolished, completely, by, caligula, although, the, united, states, government, has, never, used, a, general, sales, tax, an, excise, tax, on, whiskey, enacted, in, 1791, was, one, of, its, first, fund, raising, efforts, the, unpopularity, of, this, tax, with, farmers, on, the, western, frontier, led, to, the, whiskey, rebellion, in, 1794, federal, and, state, sales, taxes, in, the, united, states, remained, selective, rather, than, general, through, the, 19th, century, however, excise, taxes, were, applied, to, so, many, specific, commodities, during, the, civil, war, that, they, functioned, collectively, as, a, general, sales, tax, the, first, broad, based, general, sales, taxes, in, the, united, states, were, enacted, by, kentucky, and, mississippi, in, 1930, although, kentucky, repealed, its, sales, tax, in, 1936, the, federal, government, s, per, gallon, tax, of, gasoline, beginning, at, one, cent, per, gallon, in, 1932, and, per, package, tax, of, cigarettes, 1, 01, per, package, since, 2009, are, the, most, well, known, current, sales, taxes, administered, by, the, federal, government, twenty, two, other, states, began, imposing, general, sales, taxes, later, in, the, 1930s, followed, by, six, in, the, 1940s, and, five, in, the, 1950s, kentucky, re, enacted, its, sales, tax, law, in, 1960, eleven, more, states, enacted, sales, tax, laws, during, the, 1960s, with, vermont, as, the, last, in, 1969, five, states, currently, do, not, have, general, sales, taxes, alaska, delaware, montana, new, hampshire, and, oregon, the, 2010, health, care, reform, law, imposed, a, 10, percent, federal, sales, tax, on, indoor, tanning, services, effective, july, 1, 2010, unlike, previous, federal, excise, taxes, this, tax, is, collected, directly, from, the, consumer, by, the, seller, and, based, on, the, sale, price, rather, than, a, quantity, however, the, new, tax, is, selective, rather, than, general, applying, only, to, a, specific, service, canada, uses, a, value, added, federal, goods, and, services, tax, with, a, rate, of, 5, percent, effective, since, january, 1, 2008, every, province, in, canada, except, alberta, has, either, a, provincial, sales, tax, pst, or, the, harmonized, sales, tax, hst, which, is, a,
