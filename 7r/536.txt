a, judge, is, a, person, who, presides, over, court, proceedings, either, alone, or, as, a, part, of, a, panel, of, judges, in, an, adversarial, system, the, judge, hears, all, the, witnesses, and, any, other, evidence, presented, by, the, barristers, or, solicitors, of, the, case, assesses, the, credibility, and, arguments, of, the, parties, and, then, issues, a, ruling, in, the, case, based, on, their, interpretation, of, the, law, and, their, own, personal, judgment, a, judge, is, expected, to, conduct, the, trial, impartially, and, typically, in, an, open, court, the, powers, functions, method, of, appointment, discipline, and, training, of, judges, vary, widely, across, different, jurisdictions, in, some, jurisdictions, the, judge, s, powers, may, be, shared, with, a, jury, in, inquisitorial, systems, of, criminal, investigation, a, judge, might, also, be, an, examining, magistrate, the, presiding, judge, ensures, that, all, court, proceedings, are, lawful, and, orderly, the, ultimate, task, of, a, judge, is, to, settle, a, legal, dispute, in, a, final, and, publicly, lawful, manner, in, agreement, with, substantial, partialities, judges, exercise, significant, governmental, power, they, can, order, police, military, or, judicial, officials, to, execute, searches, arrests, imprisonments, garnishments, detainment, seizures, deportations, and, similar, actions, however, judges, also, supervise, that, trial, procedures, are, followed, in, order, to, ensure, consistency, and, impartiality, and, avoid, arbitrariness, the, powers, of, a, judge, are, checked, by, higher, courts, such, as, appeals, courts, and, supreme, courts, the, court, usually, has, three, main, legally, trained, court, officials, the, judge, the, prosecutor, and, the, defence, attorney, the, role, of, a, judge, varies, between, legal, systems, in, an, adversarial, system, common, law, as, in, effect, in, the, u, s, and, england, the, judge, functions, as, an, impartial, referee, mainly, ensuring, correct, procedure, while, the, prosecution, and, the, defense, present, their, case, to, a, jury, often, selected, from, common, citizens, the, main, factfinder, is, the, jury, and, the, judge, will, then, finalize, sentencing, nevertheless, in, smaller, cases, judges, can, issue, summary, judgments, without, proceeding, to, a, jury, trial, in, an, inquisitorial, system, civil, law, as, in, effect, in, continental, europe, there, is, no, jury, and, the, main, factfinder, is, the, judge, who, will, do, the, presiding, judging, and, sentencing, on, his, own, as, such, the, judge, is, expected, to, apply, the, law, directly, as, in, the, french, expression, le, juge, est, la, bouche, de, la, loi, the, judge, is, the, mouth, of, the, law, furthermore, in, some, systems, even, investigations, may, be, conducted, by, the, judge, functioning, as, an, examining, magistrate, judges, may, work, alone, in, smaller, cases, but, in, criminal, family, and, other, significant, cases, they, work, in, a, panel, in, some, civil, law, systems, this, panel, may, include, lay, judges, unlike, professional, judges, lay, judges, are, not, legally, trained, but, unlike, jurors, lay, judges, are, usually, volunteers, and, may, be, politically, appointed, judges, are, often, assisted, by, law, clerks, referendaries, and, notaries, in, legal, cases, and, by, bailiffs, or, similar, with, security, there, are, both, volunteer, and, professional, judges, a, volunteer, judge, such, as, an, english, magistrate, is, not, required, to, have, legal, training, and, is, unpaid, whereas, a, professional, judge, is, required, to, be, legally, educated, in, the, u, s, this, generally, requires, a, degree, of, juris, doctor, furthermore, significant, professional, experience, is, often, required, for, example, in, the, u, s, judges, are, often, appointed, from, experienced, attorneys, judges, are, often, appointed, by, the, head, of, state, however, in, some, jurisdictions, judges, are, elected, in, a, political, election, impartiality, is, often, considered, important, for, rule, of, law, thus, in, many, jurisdictions, judges, may, be, appointed, for, life, so, that, they, cannot, be, removed, by, the, executive, however, in, non, democratic, systems, the, appointment, of, judges, may, be, highly, politicized, and, they, often, receive, instructions, on, how, to, judge, and, may, be, removed, if, their, conduct, does, not, please, the, political, leadership, judges, must, be, able, to, research, and, process, extensive, lengths, of, documents, witness, testimonies, and, other, case, material, understand, complex, cases, and, possess, a, thorough, understanding, of, the, law, and, legal, procedure, which, requires, excellent, skills, in, logical, reasoning, analysis, and, decision, making, excellent, writing, skills, are, also, a, necessity, given, the, finality, and, authority, of, the, documents, written, judges, work, with, people, all, the, time, by, the, nature, of, the, job, good, dispute, resolution, and, interpersonal, skills, are, a, necessity, judges, are, required, to, have, good, moral, character, i, e, there, must, be, no, history, of, crime, professional, judges, often, enjoy, a, high, salary, in, the, u, s, the, median, salary, of, judges, is, 101, 690, per, annum, and, federal, judges, earn, 208, 000, 267, 000, per, annum, in, many, civil, law, countries, in, europe, the, majority, of, judges, are, women, in, 5, countries, slovenia, latvia, luxembourg, greece, and, hungary, women, make, more, that, 70, of, judges, of, the, first, instance, in, contrast, in, common, law, countries, uk, ireland, malta, and, the, united, states, the, situation, is, reverse, over, 70, of, judges, of, the, first, instance, are, men, on, the, other, hand, women, are, underrepresented, in, the, supreme, courts, in, the, usa, and, all, eu, countries, except, for, romania, in, romanian, high, court, of, cassation, and, justice, over, 80, of, judges, are, women, in, the, united, states, federal, judges, are, appointed, for, good, behavior, which, means, in, practice, that, federal, judges, work, until, they, die, voluntarily, retire, or, are, impeached, the, death, of, ruth, bader, ginsburg, in, the, office, in, 2020, and, suspension, of, pauline, newman, in, 2023, reinvigorated, the, discussion, about, mandatory, retirement, age, for, federal, judges, but, such, change, would, require, a, constitutional, amendment, and, is, unlikely, to, be, implemented, soon, states, have, more, flexibility, in, establishing, a, mandatory, retirement, age, for, judges, as, was, confirmed, by, the, scotus, in, its, 1991, decision, gregory, v, ashcroft, as, of, 2015, 33, states, and, the, district, of, columbia, had, mandatory, retirement, ages, for, state, court, judges, which, ranged, from, 70, to, 75, for, most, but, is, as, high, as, 90, in, vermont, a, 2020, study, by, the, national, bureau, of, economic, research, found, significant, positive, effects, on, the, performance, of, state, supreme, courts, with, mandatory, retirement, age, for, judges, the, authors, advocated, the, adoption, of, mandatory, retirement, ages, for, all, federal, and, state, judges, although, they, felt, that, the, individual, authorities, should, decide, on, the, specific, age, for, themselves, a, variety, of, traditions, have, become, associated, with, the, rank, or, occupation, gavels, a, ceremonial, hammer, are, used, by, judges, in, many, countries, to, the, point, that, the, gavel, has, become, a, symbol, of, a, judge, in, many, parts, of, the, world, judges, wear, long, robes, often, in, black, or, red, and, sit, on, an, elevated, platform, during, trials, known, as,
