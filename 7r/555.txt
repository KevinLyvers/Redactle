inheritance, is, the, practice, of, receiving, private, property, titles, debts, entitlements, privileges, rights, and, obligations, upon, the, death, of, an, individual, the, rules, of, inheritance, differ, among, societies, and, have, changed, over, time, officially, bequeathing, private, property, and, or, debts, can, be, performed, by, a, testator, via, will, as, attested, by, a, notary, or, by, other, lawful, means, in, law, an, heir, fem, heiress, is, a, person, who, is, entitled, to, receive, a, share, of, property, from, a, decedent, a, person, who, died, subject, to, the, rules, of, inheritance, in, the, jurisdiction, where, the, decedent, was, a, citizen, or, where, the, decedent, died, or, owned, property, at, the, time, of, death, the, inheritance, may, be, either, under, the, terms, of, a, will, or, by, intestate, laws, if, the, deceased, had, no, will, however, the, will, must, comply, with, the, laws, of, the, jurisdiction, at, the, time, it, was, created, or, it, will, be, declared, invalid, for, example, some, states, do, not, recognise, handwritten, wills, as, valid, or, only, in, specific, circumstances, and, the, intestate, laws, then, apply, the, exclusion, from, inheritance, of, a, person, who, was, an, heir, in, a, previous, will, or, would, otherwise, be, expected, to, inherit, is, termed, disinheritance, a, person, does, not, become, an, heir, since, the, exact, identity, of, the, persons, entitled, to, inherit, is, determined, only, then, members, of, ruling, noble, or, royal, houses, who, are, expected, to, become, heirs, are, called, heirs, apparent, if, first, in, line, and, incapable, of, being, displaced, from, inheriting, by, another, claim, otherwise, they, are, heirs, presumptive, there, is, a, further, concept, of, joint, inheritance, pending, renunciation, by, all, but, one, which, is, called, coparceny, in, modern, law, the, terms, inheritance, and, heir, refer, exclusively, to, succession, to, property, by, descent, from, a, deceased, dying, intestate, takers, in, property, succeeded, to, under, a, will, are, termed, generally, beneficiaries, and, specifically, devises, for, real, property, bequests, for, personal, property, except, money, or, legatees, for, money, except, in, some, jurisdictions, where, a, person, cannot, be, legally, disinherited, such, as, the, united, states, state, of, louisiana, which, allows, disinheritance, only, under, specifically, enumerated, circumstances, a, person, who, would, be, an, heir, under, intestate, laws, may, be, disinherited, completely, under, the, terms, of, a, will, an, example, is, that, of, the, will, of, comedian, jerry, lewis, his, will, specifically, disinherited, his, six, children, by, his, first, wife, and, their, descendants, leaving, his, entire, estate, to, his, second, wife, inheritance, has, been, compared, to, nepotism, detailed, anthropological, and, sociological, studies, have, been, made, about, customs, of, patrimonial, inheritance, where, only, male, children, can, inherit, some, cultures, also, employ, matrilineal, succession, where, property, can, only, pass, along, the, female, line, most, commonly, going, to, the, sister, s, sons, of, the, decedent, but, also, in, some, societies, from, the, mother, to, her, daughters, some, ancient, societies, and, most, modern, states, employ, egalitarian, inheritance, without, discrimination, based, on, gender, and, or, birth, order, the, inheritance, is, patrimonial, the, father, that, is, the, owner, of, the, land, bequeaths, only, to, his, male, descendants, so, the, promised, land, passes, from, one, jewish, father, to, his, sons, according, to, the, law, of, moses, the, firstborn, son, was, entitled, to, receive, twice, as, much, of, his, father, s, inheritance, as, the, other, sons, deuteronomy, 21, 15, 17, if, there, were, no, living, sons, and, no, descendants, of, any, previously, living, sons, daughters, inherit, in, numbers, 27, the, five, daughters, of, zelophehad, come, to, moses, and, ask, for, their, father, s, inheritance, as, they, have, no, brothers, the, order, of, inheritance, is, set, out, a, man, s, sons, inherit, first, daughters, if, no, sons, brothers, if, he, has, no, children, and, so, on, later, in, numbers, 36, some, of, the, heads, of, the, families, of, the, tribe, of, manasseh, come, to, moses, and, point, out, that, if, a, daughter, inherits, and, then, marries, a, man, not, from, her, paternal, tribe, her, land, will, pass, from, her, birth, tribe, s, inheritance, into, her, marriage, tribe, s, so, a, further, rule, is, laid, down, if, a, daughter, inherits, land, she, must, marry, someone, within, her, father, s, tribe, the, daughters, of, zelophehad, marry, the, sons, of, their, father, s, brothers, there, is, no, indication, that, this, was, not, their, choice, the, laws, of, jewish, inheritance, are, discussed, in, the, talmud, in, the, mishneh, torah, and, by, saadiah, ben, joseph, among, other, sources, all, these, sources, agree, that, the, firstborn, son, is, entitled, to, a, double, portion, of, his, father, s, estate, this, means, that, for, example, if, a, father, left, five, sons, the, firstborn, receives, a, third, of, the, estate, and, each, of, the, other, four, receives, a, sixth, if, he, left, nine, sons, the, firstborn, receives, a, fifth, and, each, of, the, other, eight, receive, a, tenth, if, the, eldest, surviving, son, is, not, the, firstborn, son, he, is, not, entitled, to, the, double, portion, philo, of, alexandria, and, josephus, also, comment, on, the, jewish, laws, of, inheritance, praising, them, above, other, law, codes, of, their, time, they, also, agreed, that, the, firstborn, son, must, receive, a, double, portion, of, his, father, s, estate, at, first, christianity, did, not, have, its, own, inheritance, traditions, distinct, from, judaism, with, the, accession, of, emperor, constantine, in, 306, christians, both, began, to, distance, themselves, from, judaism, and, to, have, influence, on, the, law, and, practices, of, secular, institutions, from, the, beginning, this, included, inheritance, the, roman, practice, of, adoption, was, a, specific, target, because, it, was, perceived, to, be, in, conflict, with, the, judeo, christian, doctrine, of, primogeniture, as, stephanie, coontz, documents, in, marriage, a, history, penguin, 2006, not, only, succession, but, the, whole, constellation, of, rights, and, practices, that, included, marriage, adoption, legitimacy, consanguinity, and, inheritance, changed, in, western, europe, from, a, greco, roman, model, to, a, judeo, christian, pattern, based, on, biblical, and, traditional, judeo, christian, principles, the, transformation, was, essentially, complete, in, the, middle, ages, although, in, english, speaking, countries, there, was, additional, development, under, the, influence, of, protestantism, even, when, europe, became, secularized, and, christianity, faded, into, the, background, the, legal, foundation, christendom, had, laid, remained, only, in, the, era, of, modern, jurisprudence, have, there, been, significant, changes, the, quran, introduced, a, number, of, different, rights, and, restrictions, on, matters, of, inheritance, including, general, improvements, to, the, treatment, of, women, and, family, life, compared, to, the, pre, islamic, societies, that, existed, in, the, arabian, peninsula, at, the, time, furthermore, the, quran, introduced, additional, heirs, that, were, not, entitled, to, inheritance, in, pre, islamic, times, mentioning, nine, relatives, specifically, of, which, six, were, female, and, three, were, male, however, the, inheritance, rights, of, women, remained, inferior, to, those, of, men, because, in, islam, someone, always, has, a, responsibility, of, looking, after, a, woman, s, expenses, according, to, quran, 4, 11, for, example, a, son, is, entitled, to, twice, as, much, inheritance, as, a, daughter, the, quran, also, presented, efforts, to, fix, the, laws, of, inheritance, and, thus, forming, a, complete, legal, system, this, development, was, in, contrast, to, pre, islamic, societies, where, rules, of, inheritance, varied, considerably, in, addition, to, the, above, changes, the, quran, imposed, restrictions, on, testamentary, powers, of, a, muslim, in, disposing, his, or, her, property, three, verses, of, the, quran, 4, 11, 4, 12, and, 4, 176, give, specific, details, of, inheritance, and, shares, in, addition, to, few, other, verses, dealing, with, testamentary, but, this, information, was, used, as, a, starting, point, by, muslim, jurists, who, expounded, the, laws, of, inheritance, even, further, using, hadith, as, well, as, methods, of, juristic, reasoning, like, qiyas, nowadays, inheritance, is, considered, an, integral, part, of, sharia, law, and, its, application, for, muslims, is, mandatory, though, many, peoples, see, historical, inheritance, systems, despite, being, muslim, have, other, inheritance, customs, the, distribution, of, the, inherited, wealth, has, varied, greatly, among, different, cultures, and, legal, traditions, in, nations, using, civil, law, for, example, the, right, of, children, to, inherit, wealth, from, parents, in, pre, defined, ratios, is, enshrined, in, law, as, far, back, as, the, code, of, hammurabi, ca, 1750, bc, in, the, us, state, of, louisiana, the, only, us, state, where, the, legal, system, is, derived, from, the, napoleonic, code, this, system, is, known, as, forced, heirship, which, prohibits, disinheritance, of, adult, children, except, for, a, few, narrowly, defined, reasons, that, a, parent, is, obligated, to, prove, other, legal, traditions, particularly, in, nations, using, common, law, allow, inheritances, to, be, divided, however, one, wishes, or, to, disinherit, any, child, for, any, reason, in, cases, of, unequal, inheritance, the, majority, might, receive, a, small, amount, while, the, minority, inherits, a, larger, amount, the, amount, of, inheritance, is, often, far, less, than, the, value, of, a, business, initially, given, to, the, son, especially, when, a, son, takes, over, a, thriving, multimillion, dollar, business, yet, the, daughter, is, given, the, balance, of, the, actual, inheritance, amounting, to, far, less, than, the, value, of, the, business, that, was, initially, given, to, the, son, this, is, especially, seen, in, old, world, cultures, but, continues, in, many, families, to, this, day, arguments, for, eliminating, forced, heirship, include, the, right, to, property, and, the, merit, of, individual, allocation, of, capital, over, government, wealth, confiscation, and, redistribution, but, this, does, not, resolve, what, some, describe, as, the, problem, of, unequal, inheritance, in, terms, of, inheritance, inequality, some, economists, and, sociologists, focus, on, the, inter, generational, transmission, of, income, or, wealth, which, is, said, to, have, a, direct, impact, on, one, s, mobility, or, immobility, and, class, position, in, society, nations, differ, on, the, political, structure, and, policy, options, that, govern, the, transfer, of, wealth, according, to, the, american, federal, government, statistics, compiled, by, mark, zandi, in, 1985, the, average, us, inheritance, was, 39, 000, in, subsequent, years, the, overall, amount, of, total, annual, inheritance, more, than, doubled, reaching, nearly, 200, billion, by, 2050, there, will, be, an, estimated, 25, trillion, inheritance, transmitted, across, generations, some, researchers, have, attributed, this, rise, to, the, baby, boomer, generation, historically, the, baby, boomers, were, the, largest, influx, of, children, conceived, after, ww2, for, this, reason, thomas, shapiro, suggests, that, this, generation, is, in, the, midst, of, benefiting, from, the, greatest, inheritance, of, wealth, in, history, inherited, wealth, may, help, explain, why, many, americans, who, have, become, rich, may, have, had, a, substantial, head, start, in, september, 2012, according, to, the, institute, for, policy, studies, over, 60, percent, of, the, forbes, richest, 400, americans, grew, up, in, substantial, privilege, and, often, but, not, always, received, substantial, inheritances, other, research, has, shown, that, many, inheritances, large, or, small, are, rapidly, squandered, similarly, analysis, shows, that, over, two, thirds, of, high, wealth, families, lose, their, wealth, within, two, generations, and, almost, 80, of, high, wealth, parents, feel, the, next, generation, is, not, financially, responsible, enough, to, handle, inheritance, it, has, been, argued, that, inheritance, plays, a, significant, effect, on, social, stratification, inheritance, is, an, integral, component, of, family, economic, and, legal, institutions, and, a, basic, mechanism, of, class, stratification, it, also, affects, the, distribution, of, wealth, at, the, societal, level, the, total, cumulative, effect, of, inheritance, on, stratification, outcomes, takes, three, forms, according, to, scholars, who, have, examined, the, subject, the, first, form, of, inheritance, is, the, inheritance, of, cultural, capital, i, e, linguistic, styles, higher, status, social, circles, and, aesthetic, preferences, the, second, form, of, inheritance, is, through, familial, interventions, in, the, form, of, inter, vivos, transfers, i, e, gifts, between, the, living, especially, at, crucial, junctures, in, the, life, courses, examples, include, during, a, child, s, milestone, stages, such, as, going, to, college, getting, married, getting, a, job, and, purchasing, a, home, the, third, form, of, inheritance, is, the, transfers, of, bulk, estates, at, the, time, of, death, of, the, testators, thus, resulting, in, significant, economic, advantage, accruing, to, children, during, their, adult, years, the, origin, of, the, stability, of, inequalities, is, material, personal, possessions, one, is, able, to, obtain, and, is, also, cultural, rooted, either, in, varying, child, rearing, practices, that, are, geared, to, socialization, according, to, social, class, and, economic, position, child, rearing, practices, among, those, who, inherit, wealth, may, center, around, favoring, some, groups, at, the, expense, of, others, at, the, bottom, of, the, social, hierarchy, it, is, further, argued, that, the, degree, to, which, economic, status, and, inheritance, is, transmitted, across, generations, determines, one, s, life, chances, in, society, although, many, have, linked, one, s, social, origins, and, educational, attainment, to, life, chances, and, opportunities, education, cannot, serve, as, the, most, influential, predictor, of, economic, mobility, in, fact, children, of, well, off, parents, generally, receive, better, schooling, and, benefit, from, material, cultural, and, genetic, inheritances, likewise, schooling, attainment, is, often, persistent, across, generations, and, families, with, higher, amounts, of, inheritance, are, able, to, acquire, and, transmit, higher, amounts, of, human, capital, lower, amounts, of, human, capital, and, inheritance, can, perpetuate, inequality, in, the, housing, market, and, higher, education, research, reveals, that, inheritance, plays, an, important, role, in, the, accumulation, of, housing, wealth, those, who, receive, an, inheritance, are, more, likely, to, own, a, home, than, those, who, do, not, regardless, of, the, size, of, the, inheritance, often, racial, or, religious, minorities, and, individuals, from, socially, disadvantaged, backgrounds, receive, less, inheritance, and, wealth, as, a, result, mixed, races, might, be, excluded, in, inheritance, privilege, and, are, more, likely, to, rent, homes, or, live, in, poorer, neighborhoods, as, well, as, achieve, lower, educational, attainment, compared, with, whites, in, america, individuals, with, a, substantial, amount, of, wealth, and, inheritance, often, intermarry, with, others, of, the, same, social, class, to, protect, their, wealth, and, ensure, the, continuous, transmission, of, inheritance, across, generations, thus, perpetuating, a, cycle, of, privilege, nations, with, the, highest, income, and, wealth, inequalities, often, have, the, highest, rates, of, homicide, and, disease, such, as, obesity, diabetes, and, hypertension, which, results, in, high, mortality, rates, a, new, york, times, article, reveals, that, the, u, s, is, the, world, s, wealthiest, nation, but, ranks, twenty, ninth, in, life, expectancy, right, behind, jordan, and, bosnia, and, has, the, second, highest, mortality, rate, of, the, comparable, oecd, countries, this, has, been, regarded, as, highly, attributed, to, the, significant, gap, of, inheritance, inequality, in, the, country, although, there, are, clearly, other, factors, such, as, the, affordability, of, healthcare, when, social, and, economic, inequalities, centered, on, inheritance, are, perpetuated, by, major, social, institutions, such, as, family, education, religion, etc, these, differing, life, opportunities, are, argued, to, be, transmitted, from, each, generation, as, a, result, this, inequality, is, believed, to, become, part, of, the, overall, social, structure, women, s, unequal, inheritance, rights, refer, to, the, disparities, and, discriminatory, practices, that, women, face, in, inheriting, property, and, assets, compared, to, men, these, inequalities, stem, from, a, combination, of, legal, cultural, and, religious, practices, that, often, prioritize, male, heirs, over, female, ones, resulting, in, significant, socio, economic, consequences, for, women, dynastic, wealth, is, monetary, inheritance, that, is, passed, on, to, generations, that, did, not, earn, it, dynastic, wealth, is, linked, to, the, term, plutocracy, much, has, been, written, about, the, rise, and, influence, of, dynastic, wealth, including, the, bestselling, book, capital, in, the, twenty, first, century, by, the, french, economist, thomas, piketty, bill, gates, uses, the, term, in, his, article, why, inequality, matters, as, communism, is, founded, on, the, marxist, labor, theory, of, value, any, money, collected, in, the, course, of, a, lifetime, is, justified, if, it, was, based, on, the, fruits, of, the, person, s, own, labor, and, not, from, exploiting, others, the, first, communist, government, installed, after, the, russian, revolution, resolved, therefore, to, abolish, the, right, of, inheritance, with, some, exceptions, many, states, have, inheritance, taxes, or, estate, taxes, under, which, a, portion, of, any, inheritance, or, estate, becomes, government, revenue
