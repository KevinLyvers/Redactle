the, iranian, languages, also, called, the, iranic, languages, are, a, branch, of, the, indo, iranian, languages, in, the, indo, european, language, family, that, are, spoken, natively, by, the, iranian, peoples, predominantly, in, the, iranian, plateau, the, iranian, languages, are, grouped, in, three, stages, old, iranian, until, 400, bce, middle, iranian, 400, bce, 900, ce, and, new, iranian, since, 900, ce, the, two, directly, attested, old, iranian, languages, are, old, persian, from, the, achaemenid, empire, and, old, avestan, the, language, of, the, avesta, of, the, middle, iranian, languages, the, better, understood, and, recorded, ones, are, middle, persian, from, the, sasanian, empire, parthian, from, the, parthian, empire, and, bactrian, from, the, kushan, and, hephthalite, empires, as, of, 2000s, ethnologue, estimates, that, there, are, 86, languages, in, the, group, pontic, steppe, caucasus, east, asia, eastern, europe, northern, europe, pontic, steppe, northern, eastern, steppe, europe, south, asia, steppe, europe, caucasus, india, indo, aryans, iranians, east, asia, europe, east, asia, europe, indo, aryan, iranian, indo, aryan, iranian, others, european, the, term, iran, derives, directly, from, middle, persian, r, n, first, attested, in, a, third, century, inscription, at, naqsh, e, rostam, with, the, accompanying, parthian, inscription, using, the, term, ary, n, in, reference, to, the, iranian, peoples, the, middle, iranian, r, n, and, ary, n, are, oblique, plural, forms, of, gentilic, nouns, r, middle, persian, and, ary, parthian, both, deriving, from, proto, iranian, language, arya, meaning, aryan, i, e, of, the, iranians, recognized, as, a, derivative, of, proto, indo, european, language, ar, yo, meaning, one, who, assembles, skilfully, in, the, iranic, languages, spoken, on, the, plateau, the, gentilic, is, attested, as, a, self, identifier, included, in, ancient, inscriptions, and, the, literature, of, the, avesta, and, remains, also, in, other, iranian, ethnic, names, alan, ossetian, ir, and, iron, when, used, as, a, linguistic, term, iranian, is, applied, to, any, language, which, descends, from, the, ancestral, proto, iranian, language, some, scholars, such, as, john, r, perry, prefer, the, term, iranic, as, the, anthropological, name, for, the, linguistic, family, and, ethnic, groups, of, this, category, and, iranian, for, anything, about, the, modern, country, of, iran, he, uses, the, same, analogue, as, in, differentiating, german, from, germanic, or, differentiating, turkish, and, turkic, this, use, of, the, term, for, the, iranian, language, family, was, introduced, in, 1836, by, christian, lassen, robert, needham, cust, used, the, term, irano, aryan, in, 1878, and, orientalists, such, as, george, abraham, grierson, and, max, m, ller, contrasted, irano, aryan, iranian, and, indo, aryan, indic, some, recent, scholarship, primarily, in, german, has, revived, this, convention, the, iranian, languages, are, divided, into, the, following, branches, according, to, modern, scholarship, the, avestan, languages, are, not, considered, to, fall, under, these, categories, and, are, instead, sometimes, classified, as, central, iranian, since, they, diverged, from, proto, iranian, before, the, east, west, division, rose, to, prominence, it, has, traditionally, been, viewed, as, eastern, iranian, however, it, lacks, a, large, number, of, eastern, iranian, features, and, thus, is, only, eastern, iranian, in, the, sense, that, it, is, not, western, the, iranian, languages, all, descend, from, a, common, ancestor, proto, iranian, which, itself, evolved, from, proto, indo, iranian, this, ancestor, language, is, speculated, to, have, origins, in, central, asia, and, the, andronovo, culture, of, the, bronze, age, is, suggested, as, a, candidate, for, the, common, indo, iranian, culture, around, 2000, bce, the, language, was, situated, precisely, in, the, western, part, of, central, asia, that, borders, present, day, russia, and, kazakhstan, it, was, thus, in, relative, proximity, to, the, other, satem, ethno, linguistic, groups, of, the, indo, european, family, such, as, thracian, balto, slavic, and, others, and, to, common, indo, european, s, original, homeland, more, precisely, the, pontic, caspian, steppe, to, the, north, of, the, black, sea, and, the, caucasus, according, to, the, reconstructed, linguistic, relationships, of, common, indo, european, proto, iranian, thus, dates, to, some, time, after, the, proto, indo, iranian, breakup, or, the, early, 2nd, millennium, bce, as, the, old, iranian, languages, began, to, break, off, and, evolve, separately, as, the, various, iranian, tribes, migrated, and, settled, in, vast, areas, of, southeastern, europe, the, iranian, plateau, and, central, asia, proto, iranian, innovations, compared, to, proto, indo, iranian, include, the, turning, of, sibilant, fricative, s, into, non, sibilant, fricative, glottal, h, the, voiced, aspirated, plosives, b, d, g, yielding, to, the, voiced, unaspirated, plosives, b, d, g, resp, the, voiceless, unaspirated, stops, p, t, k, before, another, consonant, changing, into, fricatives, f, x, resp, voiceless, aspirated, stops, p, t, k, turning, into, fricatives, f, x, resp, the, multitude, of, middle, iranian, languages, and, peoples, indicate, that, great, linguistic, diversity, must, have, existed, among, the, ancient, speakers, of, iranian, languages, of, that, variety, of, languages, dialects, direct, evidence, of, only, two, has, survived, these, are, indirectly, attested, old, iranian, languages, are, discussed, below, old, persian, was, an, old, iranian, dialect, as, it, was, spoken, in, southwestern, iran, the, modern, day, province, of, fars, by, the, inhabitants, of, parsa, persia, or, persis, who, also, gave, their, name, to, their, region, and, language, genuine, old, persian, is, best, attested, in, one, of, the, three, languages, of, the, behistun, inscription, composed, c, 520, bce, and, which, is, the, last, inscription, and, only, inscription, of, significant, length, in, which, old, persian, is, still, grammatically, correct, later, inscriptions, are, comparatively, brief, and, typically, simply, copies, of, words, and, phrases, from, earlier, ones, often, with, grammatical, errors, which, suggests, that, by, the, 4th, century, bce, the, transition, from, old, persian, to, middle, persian, was, already, far, advanced, but, efforts, were, still, being, made, to, retain, an, old, quality, for, official, proclamations, the, other, directly, attested, old, iranian, dialects, are, the, two, forms, of, avestan, which, take, their, name, from, their, use, in, the, avesta, the, liturgical, texts, of, indigenous, iranian, religion, that, now, goes, by, the, name, of, zoroastrianism, but, in, the, avesta, itself, is, simply, known, as, vohu, daena, later, behdin, the, language, of, the, avesta, is, subdivided, into, two, dialects, conventionally, known, as, old, or, gathic, avestan, and, younger, avestan, these, terms, which, date, to, the, 19th, century, are, slightly, misleading, since, younger, avestan, is, not, only, much, younger, than, old, avestan, but, also, from, a, different, geographic, region, the, old, avestan, dialect, is, very, archaic, and, at, roughly, the, same, stage, of, development, as, rigvedic, sanskrit, on, the, other, hand, younger, avestan, is, at, about, the, same, linguistic, stage, as, old, persian, but, by, virtue, of, its, use, as, a, sacred, language, retained, its, old, characteristics, long, after, the, old, iranian, languages, had, yielded, to, their, middle, iranian, stage, unlike, old, persian, which, has, middle, persian, as, its, known, successor, avestan, has, no, clearly, identifiable, middle, iranian, stage, the, effect, of, middle, iranian, is, indistinguishable, from, effects, due, to, other, causes, in, addition, to, old, persian, and, avestan, which, are, the, only, directly, attested, old, iranian, languages, all, middle, iranian, languages, must, have, had, a, predecessor, old, iranian, form, of, that, language, and, thus, can, all, be, said, to, have, had, an, at, least, hypothetical, old, form, such, hypothetical, old, iranian, languages, include, old, parthian, additionally, the, existence, of, unattested, languages, can, sometimes, be, inferred, from, the, impact, they, had, on, neighbouring, languages, such, transfer, is, known, to, have, occurred, for, old, persian, which, has, what, is, called, a, median, substrate, in, some, of, its, vocabulary, also, foreign, references, to, languages, can, also, provide, a, hint, to, the, existence, of, otherwise, unattested, languages, for, example, through, toponyms, ethnonyms, or, in, the, recording, of, vocabulary, as, herodotus, did, for, what, he, called, scythian, and, in, one, instance, median, dog, conventionally, iranian, languages, are, grouped, into, western, and, eastern, branches, these, terms, have, little, meaning, with, respect, to, old, avestan, as, that, stage, of, the, language, may, predate, the, settling, of, the, iranian, peoples, into, western, and, eastern, groups, the, geographic, terms, also, have, little, meaning, when, applied, to, younger, avestan, since, it, is, not, known, where, that, dialect, or, dialects, was, spoken, either, certain, is, only, that, avestan, all, forms, and, old, persian, are, distinct, and, since, old, persian, is, western, and, avestan, was, not, old, persian, avestan, acquired, a, default, assignment, to, eastern, further, confusing, the, issue, is, the, introduction, of, a, western, iranian, substrate, in, later, avestan, compositions, and, redactions, undertaken, at, the, centers, of, imperial, power, in, western, iran, either, in, the, south, west, in, persia, or, in, the, north, west, in, nisa, parthia, and, ecbatana, media, two, of, the, earliest, dialectal, divisions, among, iranian, indeed, happen, to, not, follow, the, later, division, into, western, and, eastern, blocks, these, concern, the, fate, of, the, proto, indo, iranian, first, series, palatal, consonants, and, d, as, a, common, intermediate, stage, it, is, possible, to, reconstruct, depalatalized, affricates, c, dz, this, coincides, with, the, state, of, affairs, in, the, neighboring, nuristani, languages, a, further, complication, however, concerns, the, consonant, clusters, w, and, d, w, a, division, of, iranian, languages, in, at, least, three, groups, during, the, old, iranian, period, is, thus, implied, it, is, possible, that, other, distinct, dialect, groups, were, already, in, existence, during, this, period, good, candidates, are, the, hypothetical, ancestor, languages, of, alanian, scytho, sarmatian, subgroup, of, scythian, in, the, far, northwest, and, the, hypothetical, old, parthian, the, old, iranian, ancestor, of, parthian, in, the, near, northwest, where, original, dw, b, paralleling, the, development, of, w, what, is, known, in, iranian, linguistic, history, as, the, middle, iranian, era, is, thought, to, begin, around, the, 4th, century, bce, lasting, through, the, 9th, century, linguistically, the, middle, iranian, languages, are, conventionally, classified, into, two, main, groups, western, and, eastern, the, western, family, includes, parthian, arsacid, pahlavi, and, middle, persian, while, bactrian, sogdian, khwarezmian, saka, and, old, ossetic, scytho, sarmatian, fall, under, the, eastern, category, the, two, languages, of, the, western, group, were, linguistically, very, close, to, each, other, but, quite, distinct, from, their, eastern, counterparts, on, the, other, hand, the, eastern, group, was, an, areal, entity, whose, languages, retained, some, similarity, to, avestan, they, were, inscribed, in, various, aramaic, derived, alphabets, which, had, ultimately, evolved, from, the, achaemenid, imperial, aramaic, script, though, bactrian, was, written, using, an, adapted, greek, script, middle, persian, pahlavi, was, the, official, language, under, the, sasanian, dynasty, in, iran, it, was, in, use, from, the, 3rd, century, ce, until, the, beginning, of, the, 10th, century, the, script, used, for, middle, persian, in, this, era, underwent, significant, maturity, middle, persian, parthian, and, sogdian, were, also, used, as, literary, languages, by, the, manichaeans, whose, texts, also, survive, in, various, non, iranian, languages, from, latin, to, chinese, manichaean, texts, were, written, in, a, script, closely, akin, to, the, syriac, script, following, the, arab, conquest, of, persia, there, were, important, changes, in, the, role, of, the, different, dialects, within, the, persian, empire, the, old, prestige, form, of, middle, iranian, also, known, as, pahlavi, was, replaced, by, a, new, standard, dialect, called, dari, as, the, official, language, of, the, court, the, name, dari, comes, from, the, word, darb, r, which, refers, to, the, royal, court, where, many, of, the, poets, protagonists, and, patrons, of, the, literature, flourished, the, saffarid, dynasty, in, particular, was, the, first, in, a, line, of, many, dynasties, to, officially, adopt, the, new, language, in, 875, ce, dari, may, have, been, heavily, influenced, by, regional, dialects, of, eastern, iran, whereas, the, earlier, pahlavi, standard, was, based, more, on, western, dialects, this, new, prestige, dialect, became, the, basis, of, standard, new, persian, medieval, iranian, scholars, such, as, abdullah, ibn, al, muqaffa, 8th, century, and, ibn, al, nadim, 10th, century, associated, the, term, dari, with, the, eastern, province, of, khorasan, while, they, used, the, term, pahlavi, to, describe, the, dialects, of, the, northwestern, areas, between, isfahan, and, azerbaijan, and, p, rsi, persian, proper, to, describe, the, dialects, of, fars, persia, they, also, noted, that, the, unofficial, language, of, the, royalty, itself, was, yet, another, dialect, khuzi, associated, with, the, western, province, of, khuzestan, the, islamic, conquest, also, brought, with, it, the, adoption, of, the, arabic, script, for, writing, persian, and, much, later, kurdish, pashto, and, balochi, all, three, were, adapted, to, the, writing, by, the, addition, of, a, few, letters, this, development, probably, occurred, sometime, during, the, second, half, of, the, 8th, century, when, the, old, middle, persian, script, began, dwindling, in, usage, the, arabic, script, remains, in, use, in, contemporary, modern, persian, tajik, script, used, to, write, the, tajik, language, was, first, latinised, in, the, 1920s, under, the, then, soviet, nationality, policy, the, script, was, however, subsequently, cyrillicized, in, the, 1930s, by, the, soviet, government, the, geographical, regions, in, which, iranian, languages, were, spoken, were, pushed, back, in, several, areas, by, newly, neighbouring, languages, arabic, spread, into, some, parts, of, western, iran, khuzestan, and, turkic, languages, spread, through, much, of, central, asia, displacing, various, iranian, languages, such, as, sogdian, and, bactrian, in, parts, of, what, is, today, turkmenistan, uzbekistan, and, tajikistan, in, eastern, europe, mostly, comprising, the, territory, of, modern, day, ukraine, southern, european, russia, and, parts, of, the, balkans, the, core, region, of, the, native, scythians, sarmatians, and, alans, had, been, decisively, taken, over, as, a, result, of, absorption, and, assimilation, e, g, slavicisation, by, the, various, proto, slavic, population, of, the, region, by, the, 6th, century, ce, this, resulted, in, the, displacement, and, extinction, of, the, once, predominant, scythian, languages, of, the, region, sogdian, s, close, relative, yaghnobi, barely, survives, in, a, small, area, of, the, zarafshan, valley, east, of, samarkand, and, saka, as, ossetic, in, the, caucasus, which, is, the, sole, remnant, of, the, once, predominant, scythian, languages, in, eastern, europe, proper, and, large, parts, of, the, north, caucasus, various, small, iranian, languages, in, the, pamir, mountains, survive, that, are, derived, from, eastern, iranian, xigh, masc, d, t, r, daughter
