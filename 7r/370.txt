niger, congo, is, a, hypothetical, language, family, spoken, over, the, majority, of, sub, saharan, africa, it, unites, the, mande, languages, the, atlantic, congo, languages, which, share, a, characteristic, noun, class, system, and, possibly, several, smaller, groups, of, languages, that, are, difficult, to, classify, if, valid, niger, congo, would, be, the, world, s, largest, in, terms, of, member, languages, the, third, largest, in, terms, of, speakers, and, africa, s, largest, in, terms, of, geographical, area, austronesian, has, almost, as, many, member, languages, although, this, is, complicated, by, the, ambiguity, about, what, constitutes, a, distinct, language, the, number, of, named, niger, congo, languages, listed, by, ethnologue, is, 1, 540, the, proposed, family, would, be, the, third, largest, in, the, world, by, number, of, native, speakers, with, around, 700, million, people, as, of, 2015, within, niger, congo, the, bantu, languages, alone, account, for, 350, million, people, 2015, or, half, the, total, niger, congo, speaking, population, the, most, widely, spoken, niger, congo, languages, by, number, of, native, speakers, are, yoruba, igbo, fula, lingala, ewe, fon, ga, dangme, shona, sesotho, xhosa, zulu, akan, and, moor, the, most, widely, spoken, by, the, total, number, of, speakers, is, swahili, which, is, used, as, a, lingua, franca, in, parts, of, eastern, and, southeastern, africa, while, the, ultimate, genetic, unity, of, the, core, of, niger, congo, called, atlantic, congo, is, widely, accepted, the, internal, cladistic, structure, is, not, well, established, other, primary, branches, may, include, dogon, mande, ijo, katla, and, rashad, the, connection, of, the, mande, languages, especially, has, never, been, demonstrated, and, without, them, the, validity, of, niger, congo, family, as, a, whole, as, opposed, to, atlantic, congo, or, a, similar, subfamily, has, not, been, established, one, of, the, most, distinctive, characteristics, common, to, atlantic, congo, languages, is, the, use, of, a, noun, class, system, which, is, essentially, a, gender, system, with, multiple, genders, the, language, family, most, likely, originated, in, or, near, the, area, where, these, languages, were, spoken, prior, to, bantu, expansion, i, e, west, africa, or, central, africa, its, expansion, may, have, been, associated, with, the, expansion, of, sahel, agriculture, in, the, african, neolithic, period, following, the, desiccation, of, the, sahara, in, c, 3500, bce, according, to, roger, blench, 2004, all, specialists, in, niger, congo, languages, believe, the, languages, to, have, a, common, origin, rather, than, merely, constituting, a, typological, classification, for, reasons, including, their, shared, noun, class, system, shared, verbal, extensions, and, shared, basic, lexicon, similar, classifications, to, niger, congo, have, been, made, ever, since, diedrich, westermann, in, 1922, joseph, greenberg, continued, that, tradition, making, it, the, starting, point, for, modern, linguistic, classification, in, africa, with, some, of, his, most, notable, publications, going, to, press, starting, in, the, 1960s, however, there, has, been, active, debate, for, many, decades, over, the, appropriate, subclassifications, of, the, languages, in, this, language, family, which, is, a, key, tool, used, in, localising, a, language, s, place, of, origin, no, definitive, proto, niger, congo, lexicon, or, grammar, has, been, developed, for, the, language, family, as, a, whole, an, important, unresolved, issue, in, determining, the, time, and, place, where, the, niger, congo, languages, originated, and, their, range, prior, to, recorded, history, is, this, language, family, s, relationship, to, the, kordofanian, languages, now, spoken, in, the, nuba, mountains, of, sudan, which, is, not, contiguous, with, the, remainder, of, the, niger, congo, language, speaking, region, and, is, at, the, northeasternmost, extent, of, the, current, niger, congo, linguistic, region, the, current, prevailing, linguistic, view, is, that, kordofanian, languages, are, part, of, the, niger, congo, language, family, and, that, these, may, be, the, first, of, the, many, languages, still, spoken, in, that, region, to, have, been, spoken, in, the, region, the, evidence, is, insufficient, to, determine, if, this, outlier, group, of, niger, congo, language, speakers, represents, a, prehistoric, range, of, a, niger, congo, linguistic, region, that, has, since, contracted, as, other, languages, have, intruded, or, if, instead, this, represents, a, group, of, niger, congo, language, speakers, who, migrated, to, the, area, at, some, point, in, prehistory, where, they, were, an, isolated, linguistic, community, from, the, beginning, there, is, more, agreement, regarding, the, place, of, origin, of, benue, congo, the, largest, subfamily, of, the, group, within, benue, congo, the, place, of, origin, of, the, bantu, languages, as, well, as, time, at, which, it, started, to, expand, is, known, with, great, specificity, blench, 2004, relying, particularly, on, prior, work, by, kay, williamson, and, p, de, wolf, argued, that, benue, congo, probably, originated, at, the, confluence, of, the, benue, and, niger, rivers, in, central, nigeria, these, estimates, of, the, place, of, origin, of, the, benue, congo, language, family, do, not, fix, a, date, for, the, start, of, that, expansion, other, than, that, it, must, have, been, sufficiently, prior, to, the, bantu, expansion, to, allow, for, the, diversification, of, the, languages, within, this, language, family, that, includes, bantu, the, classification, of, the, relatively, divergent, family, of, the, ubangian, languages, centred, in, the, central, african, republic, as, part, of, the, niger, congo, language, family, is, disputed, ubangian, was, grouped, with, niger, congo, by, greenberg, 1963, and, later, authorities, concurred, but, it, was, questioned, by, dimmendaal, 2008, the, bantu, expansion, beginning, around, 1000, bc, swept, across, much, of, central, and, southern, africa, leading, to, the, assimilation, and, extinction, of, many, of, the, indigenous, pygmy, and, bushmen, khoisan, populations, there, the, following, is, an, overview, of, the, language, groups, usually, included, in, niger, congo, the, genetic, relationship, of, some, branches, is, not, universally, accepted, and, the, cladistic, connection, between, those, who, are, accepted, as, related, may, also, be, unclear, the, core, phylum, of, the, niger, congo, group, are, the, atlantic, congo, languages, the, non, atlantic, congo, languages, within, niger, congo, are, grouped, as, dogon, mande, ijo, sometimes, with, defaka, as, ijoid, katla, and, rashad, atlantic, congo, combines, the, atlantic, languages, which, do, not, form, one, branch, and, volta, congo, it, comprises, more, than, 80, of, the, niger, congo, speaking, population, or, close, to, 600, million, people, 2015, the, proposed, savannas, group, combines, adamawa, ubangian, and, gur, outside, of, the, savannas, group, volta, congo, comprises, kru, kwa, or, west, kwa, volta, niger, also, east, kwa, or, west, benue, congo, and, benue, congo, or, east, benue, congo, volta, niger, includes, the, two, largest, languages, of, nigeria, yoruba, and, igbo, benue, congo, includes, the, southern, bantoid, group, which, is, dominated, by, the, bantu, languages, which, account, for, 350, million, people, 2015, or, half, the, total, niger, congo, speaking, population, the, strict, genetic, unity, of, any, of, these, subgroups, may, themselves, be, under, dispute, for, example, roger, blench, 2012, argued, that, adamawa, ubangian, kwa, bantoid, and, bantu, are, not, coherent, groups, although, the, kordofanian, branch, is, generally, included, in, the, niger, congo, languages, some, researchers, do, not, agree, with, its, inclusion, glottolog, 3, 4, 2019, does, not, accept, that, the, kordofanian, branches, lafofa, talodi, and, heiban, or, the, difficult, to, classify, laal, language, have, been, demonstrated, to, be, atlantic, congo, languages, it, otherwise, accepts, the, family, but, not, its, inclusion, within, a, broader, niger, congo, glottolog, also, considers, ijoid, mande, and, dogon, to, be, independent, language, phyla, that, have, not, been, demonstrated, to, be, related, to, each, other, the, atlantic, congo, group, is, characterised, by, the, noun, class, systems, of, its, languages, atlantic, congo, largely, corresponds, to, mukarovsky, s, western, nigritic, phylum, the, polyphyletic, atlantic, group, accounts, for, about, 35, million, speakers, as, of, 2016, mostly, accounted, for, by, fula, and, wolof, speakers, atlantic, is, not, considered, to, constitute, a, valid, group, the, putative, niger, congo, languages, outside, of, the, atlantic, congo, family, are, centred, in, the, upper, senegal, and, niger, river, basins, south, and, west, of, timbuktu, mande, dogon, the, niger, delta, ijoid, and, far, to, the, east, in, south, central, sudan, around, the, nuba, mountains, the, kordofanian, families, they, account, for, a, total, population, of, about, 100, million, 2015, mostly, mand, and, ijaw, the, various, kordofanian, languages, are, spoken, in, south, central, sudan, around, the, nuba, mountains, kordofanian, is, a, geographic, grouping, not, a, genetic, one, named, for, the, kordofan, region, these, are, minor, languages, spoken, by, a, total, of, about, 100, 000, people, according, to, 1980s, estimates, katla, and, rashad, languages, show, isoglosses, with, benue, congo, that, the, other, families, lack, the, endangered, or, extinct, laal, mpre, and, jalaa, languages, are, often, assigned, to, niger, congo, niger, congo, as, it, is, known, today, was, only, gradually, recognized, as, a, linguistic, unit, in, early, classifications, of, the, languages, of, africa, one, of, the, principal, criteria, used, to, distinguish, different, groupings, was, the, languages, use, of, prefixes, to, classify, nouns, or, the, lack, thereof, a, major, advance, came, with, the, work, of, sigismund, wilhelm, koelle, who, in, his, 1854, polyglotta, africana, attempted, a, careful, classification, the, groupings, of, which, in, quite, a, number, of, cases, correspond, to, modern, groupings, an, early, sketch, of, the, extent, of, niger, congo, as, one, language, family, can, be, found, in, koelle, s, observation, echoed, in, bleek, 1856, that, the, atlantic, languages, used, prefixes, just, like, many, southern, african, languages, subsequent, work, of, bleek, and, some, decades, later, the, comparative, work, of, meinhof, solidly, established, bantu, as, a, linguistic, unit, in, many, cases, wider, classifications, employed, a, blend, of, typological, and, racial, criteria, thus, friedrich, m, ller, in, his, ambitious, classification, 1876, 88, separated, the, negro, and, bantu, languages, likewise, the, africanist, karl, richard, lepsius, considered, bantu, to, be, of, african, origin, and, many, mixed, negro, languages, as, products, of, an, encounter, between, bantu, and, intruding, asiatic, languages, in, this, period, a, relation, between, bantu, and, languages, with, bantu, like, but, less, complete, noun, class, systems, began, to, emerge, some, authors, saw, the, latter, as, languages, which, had, not, yet, completely, evolved, to, full, bantu, status, whereas, others, regarded, them, as, languages, which, had, partly, lost, original, features, still, found, in, bantu, the, bantuist, meinhof, made, a, major, distinction, between, bantu, and, a, semi, bantu, group, which, according, to, him, was, originally, of, the, unrelated, sudanic, stock, westermann, a, pupil, of, meinhof, set, out, to, establish, the, internal, classification, of, the, then, sudanic, languages, in, a, 1911, work, he, established, a, basic, division, between, east, and, west, a, historical, reconstruction, of, west, sudanic, was, published, in, 1927, and, in, his, 1935, charakter, und, einteilung, der, sudansprachen, he, conclusively, established, the, relationship, between, bantu, and, west, sudanic, joseph, greenberg, took, westermann, s, work, as, a, starting, point, for, his, own, classification, in, a, series, of, articles, published, between, 1949, and, 1954, he, argued, that, westermann, s, west, sudanic, and, bantu, formed, a, single, genetic, family, which, he, named, niger, congo, that, bantu, constituted, a, subgroup, of, the, benue, congo, branch, that, adamawa, eastern, previously, not, considered, to, be, related, was, another, member, of, this, family, and, that, fula, belonged, to, the, west, atlantic, languages, just, before, these, articles, were, collected, in, final, book, form, the, languages, of, africa, in, 1963, he, amended, his, classification, by, adding, kordofanian, as, a, branch, co, ordinate, with, niger, congo, as, a, whole, consequently, he, renamed, the, family, congo, kordofanian, later, niger, kordofanian, greenberg, s, work, on, african, languages, though, initially, greeted, with, scepticism, became, the, prevailing, view, among, scholars, bennet, and, sterk, 1977, presented, an, internal, reclassification, based, on, lexicostatistics, that, laid, the, foundation, for, the, regrouping, in, bendor, samuel, 1989, kordofanian, was, presented, as, one, of, several, primary, branches, rather, than, being, coordinate, to, the, family, as, a, whole, prompting, re, introduction, of, the, term, niger, congo, which, is, in, current, use, among, linguists, many, classifications, continue, to, place, kordofanian, as, the, most, distant, branch, but, mainly, due, to, negative, evidence, fewer, lexical, correspondences, rather, than, positive, evidence, that, the, other, languages, form, a, valid, genealogical, group, likewise, mande, is, often, assumed, to, be, the, second, most, distant, branch, based, on, its, lack, of, the, noun, class, system, prototypical, of, the, niger, congo, family, other, branches, lacking, any, trace, of, the, noun, class, system, are, dogon, and, ijaw, whereas, the, talodi, branch, of, kordofanian, does, have, cognate, noun, classes, suggesting, that, kordofanian, is, also, not, a, unitary, group, pozdniakov, 2012, stated, the, hypothesis, of, kinship, between, niger, congo, languages, didn, t, appear, as, a, result, of, discovery, of, numerous, related, forms, for, example, in, mande, and, adamawa, it, appeared, as, a, result, of, comparison, between, the, bantu, languages, for, which, the, classical, comparative, method, was, possible, to, be, applied, and, which, were, reliably, reconstructed, with, other, african, languages, niger, congo, does, not, exist, without, bantu, we, need, to, say, clearly, that, if, we, establish, a, genetic, relationship, between, a, form, in, bantu, and, in, atlantic, languages, or, between, bantu, and, mande, we, have, all, grounds, to, trace, this, form, back, to, niger, congo, if, we, establish, such, a, relationship, between, mel, and, kru, or, between, mande, and, dogon, we, don, t, have, enough, reason, to, claim, it, niger, congo, in, other, words, all, niger, congo, languages, are, equal, but, bantu, languages, are, more, equal, than, the, others, glottolog, 2013, accepts, the, core, with, noun, class, systems, the, atlantic, congo, languages, apart, from, the, recent, inclusion, of, some, of, the, kordofanian, groups, but, not, niger, congo, as, a, whole, they, list, the, following, as, separate, families, atlantic, congo, mande, dogon, ijoid, lafofa, katla, tima, heiban, talodi, and, rashad, babaev, 2013, stated, the, truth, here, is, that, almost, no, attempts, in, fact, have, been, made, to, verify, greenberg, s, niger, congo, hypothesis, this, might, seem, strange, but, the, path, laid, by, joseph, greenberg, to, proto, niger, congo, was, not, followed, by, much, research, most, scholars, have, focused, on, individual, families, or, groups, and, classifications, as, well, as, reconstructions, were, made, on, lower, levels, compared, with, the, volume, of, literature, on, atlantic, or, mande, languages, the, list, of, papers, considering, the, aspects, of, niger, congo, reconstruction, per, se, is, quite, scarce, oxford, handbooks, online, 2016, has, indicated, that, the, continuing, reassessment, of, niger, congo, s, internal, structure, is, due, largely, to, the, preliminary, nature, of, greenberg, s, classification, explicitly, based, as, it, was, on, a, methodology, that, doesn, t, produce, proofs, for, genetic, affiliations, between, languages, but, rather, aims, at, identifying, likely, candidates, the, ongoing, descriptive, and, documentary, work, on, individual, languages, and, their, varieties, greatly, expanding, our, knowledge, on, formerly, little, known, linguistic, regions, is, helping, to, identify, clusters, and, units, that, allow, for, the, application, of, the, historical, comparative, method, only, the, reconstruction, of, lower, level, units, instead, of, big, picture, contributions, based, on, mass, comparison, can, help, to, verify, or, disprove, our, present, concept, of, niger, congo, as, a, genetic, grouping, consisting, of, benue, congo, plus, volta, niger, kwa, adamawa, plus, gur, kru, the, so, called, kordofanian, languages, and, probably, the, language, groups, traditionally, classified, as, atlantic, the, coherence, of, niger, congo, as, a, language, phylum, is, supported, by, grollemund, et, al, 2016, using, computational, phylogenetic, methods, the, east, west, volta, congo, division, west, east, benue, congo, division, and, north, south, bantoid, division, are, not, supported, whereas, a, bantoid, group, consisting, of, ekoid, bendi, dakoid, jukunoid, tivoid, mambiloid, beboid, mamfe, tikar, grassfields, and, bantu, is, supported, the, automated, similarity, judgment, program, asjp, also, groups, many, niger, congo, branches, together, dimmendaal, crevels, and, muysken, 2020, stated, greenberg, s, hypothesis, of, niger, congo, phylum, has, sometimes, been, taken, as, an, established, fact, rather, than, a, hypothesis, awaiting, further, proof, but, there, have, also, been, attempts, to, look, at, his, argumentation, in, more, detail, much, of, the, discussion, concerning, niger, congo, after, greenberg, s, seminal, contribution, in, fact, centered, around, the, inclusion, or, exclusion, of, specific, languages, or, language, groups, good, 2020, stated, first, proposed, by, greenberg, 1949, niger, congo, nc, has, for, decades, been, treated, as, one, of, the, four, major, phyla, of, african, languages, the, term, as, presently, used, however, is, not, without, its, difficulties, on, the, one, hand, it, is, employed, as, a, referential, label, for, a, group, of, over, 1, 500, languages, putting, it, among, the, largest, commonly, cited, language, groups, in, the, world, on, the, other, hand, the, term, is, also, intended, to, embody, a, hypothesis, of, genealogical, relationship, between, the, referential, nc, languages, that, has, not, been, proven, the, lexicon, of, proto, niger, congo, or, proto, atlantic, congo, has, not, been, comprehensively, reconstructed, although, konstantin, pozdniakov, reconstructed, the, numeral, system, of, proto, niger, congo, in, 2018, the, most, extensive, reconstructions, of, lower, order, niger, congo, branches, include, several, reconstructions, of, proto, bantu, which, has, consequently, had, a, disproportionate, influence, on, conceptions, of, what, proto, niger, congo, may, have, been, like, the, only, stage, higher, than, proto, bantu, that, has, been, reconstructed, is, a, pilot, project, by, stewart, who, since, the, 1970s, has, reconstructed, the, common, ancestor, of, the, potou, tano, and, bantu, languages, without, so, far, considering, the, hundreds, of, other, languages, which, presumably, descend, from, that, same, ancestor, over, the, years, several, linguists, have, suggested, a, link, between, niger, congo, and, nilo, saharan, probably, starting, with, westermann, s, comparative, work, on, the, sudanic, family, in, which, eastern, sudanic, now, classified, as, nilo, saharan, and, western, sudanic, now, classified, as, niger, congo, were, united, gregersen, 1972, proposed, that, niger, congo, and, nilo, saharan, be, united, into, a, larger, phylum, which, he, termed, kongo, saharan, his, evidence, was, mainly, based, on, the, uncertainty, in, the, classification, of, songhay, morphological, resemblances, and, lexical, similarities, a, more, recent, proponent, was, roger, blench, 1995, who, puts, forward, phonological, morphological, and, lexical, evidence, for, uniting, niger, congo, and, nilo, saharan, in, a, niger, saharan, phylum, with, special, affinity, between, niger, congo, and, central, sudanic, however, fifteen, years, later, his, views, had, changed, with, blench, 2011, proposing, instead, that, the, noun, classifier, system, of, central, sudanic, commonly, reflected, in, a, tripartite, general, singulative, plurative, number, system, triggered, the, development, or, elaboration, of, the, noun, class, system, of, the, atlantic, congo, languages, with, tripartite, number, marking, surviving, in, the, plateau, and, gur, languages, of, niger, congo, and, the, lexical, similarities, being, due, to, loans, niger, congo, languages, have, a, clear, preference, for, open, syllables, of, the, type, cv, consonant, vowel, the, typical, word, structure, of, proto, niger, congo, though, it, has, not, been, reconstructed, is, thought, to, have, been, cvcv, a, structure, still, attested, in, for, example, bantu, mande, and, ijoid, in, many, other, branches, this, structure, has, been, reduced, through, phonological, change, verbs, are, composed, of, a, root, followed, by, one, or, more, extensional, suffixes, nouns, consist, of, a, root, originally, preceded, by, a, noun, class, prefix, of, c, v, shape, which, is, often, eroded, by, phonological, change, several, branches, of, niger, congo, have, a, regular, phonological, contrast, between, two, classes, of, consonants, pending, more, clarity, as, to, the, precise, nature, of, this, contrast, it, is, commonly, characterized, as, a, contrast, between, fortis, and, lenis, consonants, many, niger, congo, languages, vowel, harmony, is, based, on, the, advanced, tongue, root, feature, in, this, type, of, vowel, harmony, the, position, of, the, root, of, the, tongue, in, regards, to, backness, is, the, phonetic, basis, for, the, distinction, between, two, harmonizing, sets, of, vowels, in, its, fullest, form, this, type, involves, two, classes, each, of, five, vowels, the, roots, are, then, divided, into, and, categories, this, feature, is, lexically, assigned, to, the, roots, because, there, is, no, determiner, within, a, normal, root, that, causes, the, value, there, are, two, types, of, vowel, harmony, controllers, in, niger, congo, the, first, controller, is, the, root, when, a, root, contains, a, or, vowel, then, that, value, is, applied, to, the, rest, of, the, word, which, involves, crossing, morpheme, boundaries, for, example, suffixes, in, wolof, assimilate, to, the, value, of, the, root, to, which, they, attach, the, following, examples, of, these, suffixes, alternate, depending, on, the, root, furthermore, the, directionality, of, assimilation, in, root, controlled, vowel, harmony, need, not, be, specified, the, root, features, and, spread, left, and, or, right, as, needed, so, that, no, vowel, would, lack, a, specification, and, be, ill, formed, unlike, in, the, root, controlled, harmony, system, where, the, two, values, behave, symmetrically, a, large, number, of, niger, congo, languages, exhibit, a, pattern, where, the, value, is, more, active, or, dominant, than, the, value, this, results, in, the, second, vowel, harmony, controller, being, the, value, if, there, is, even, one, vowel, that, is, in, the, whole, word, then, the, rest, of, the, vowels, harmonize, with, that, feature, however, if, there, is, no, vowel, that, is, the, vowels, appear, in, their, underlying, form, this, form, of, vowel, harmony, control, is, best, exhibited, in, west, african, languages, for, example, in, nawuri, the, diminutive, suffix, bi, will, cause, the, underlying, vowels, in, a, word, to, become, phonetically, there, are, two, types, of, vowels, which, affect, the, harmony, process, these, are, known, as, neutral, or, opaque, vowels, neutral, vowels, do, not, harmonize, to, the, value, of, the, word, and, instead, maintain, their, own, value, the, vowels, that, follow, them, however, will, receive, the, value, of, the, root, opaque, vowels, maintain, their, own, value, as, well, but, they, affect, the, harmony, process, behind, them, all, of, the, vowels, following, an, opaque, vowel, will, harmonize, with, the, value, of, the, opaque, vowel, instead, of, the, vowel, of, the, root, the, vowel, inventory, listed, above, is, a, ten, vowel, language, this, is, a, language, in, which, all, of, the, vowels, of, the, language, participate, in, the, harmony, system, producing, five, harmonic, pairs, vowel, inventories, of, this, type, are, still, found, in, some, branches, of, niger, congo, for, example, in, the, ghana, togo, mountain, languages, however, this, is, the, rarer, inventory, as, oftentimes, there, are, one, or, more, vowels, that, are, not, part, of, a, harmonic, pair, this, has, resulted, in, seven, and, nine, vowel, systems, being, the, more, popular, systems, the, majority, of, languages, with, controlled, vowel, harmony, have, either, seven, or, nine, vowel, phonemes, with, the, most, common, non, participatory, vowel, being, a, it, has, been, asserted, that, this, is, because, vowel, quality, differences, in, the, mid, central, region, where, the, counterpart, of, a, is, found, are, difficult, to, perceive, another, possible, reason, for, the, non, participatory, status, of, a, is, that, there, is, articulatory, difficulty, in, advancing, the, tongue, root, when, the, tongue, body, is, low, in, order, to, produce, a, low, vowel, therefore, the, vowel, inventory, for, nine, vowel, languages, is, generally, and, seven, vowel, languages, have, one, of, two, inventories, note, that, in, the, nine, vowel, language, the, missing, vowel, is, in, fact, s, counterpart, as, would, be, expected, the, fact, that, ten, vowels, have, been, reconstructed, for, proto, ijoid, has, led, to, the, hypothesis, that, the, original, vowel, inventory, of, niger, congo, was, a, full, ten, vowel, system, on, the, other, hand, stewart, in, recent, comparative, work, reconstructs, a, seven, vowel, system, for, his, proto, potou, akanic, bantu, several, scholars, have, documented, a, contrast, between, oral, and, nasal, vowels, in, niger, congo, in, his, reconstruction, of, proto, volta, congo, steward, 1976, postulates, that, nasal, consonants, have, originated, under, the, influence, of, nasal, vowels, this, hypothesis, is, supported, by, the, fact, that, there, are, several, niger, congo, languages, that, have, been, analysed, as, lacking, nasal, consonants, altogether, languages, like, this, have, nasal, vowels, accompanied, with, complementary, distribution, between, oral, and, nasal, consonants, before, oral, and, nasal, vowels, subsequent, loss, of, the, nasal, oral, contrast, in, vowels, may, result, in, nasal, consonants, becoming, part, of, the, phoneme, inventory, in, all, cases, reported, to, date, the, bilabial, m, is, the, first, nasal, consonant, to, be, phonologized, niger, congo, thus, invalidates, two, common, assumptions, about, nasals, that, all, languages, have, at, least, one, primary, nasal, consonant, and, that, if, a, language, has, only, one, primary, nasal, consonant, it, is, n, niger, congo, languages, commonly, show, fewer, nasalized, than, oral, vowels, kasem, a, language, with, a, ten, vowel, system, employing, atr, vowel, harmony, has, seven, nasalized, vowels, similarly, yoruba, has, seven, oral, vowels, and, only, five, nasal, ones, however, the, language, of, zialo, has, a, nasal, equivalent, for, each, of, its, seven, oral, vowels, the, large, majority, of, present, day, niger, congo, languages, are, tonal, a, typical, niger, congo, tone, system, involves, two, or, three, contrastive, level, tones, four, level, systems, are, less, widespread, and, five, level, systems, are, rare, only, a, few, niger, congo, languages, are, non, tonal, swahili, is, perhaps, the, best, known, but, within, the, atlantic, branch, some, others, are, found, proto, niger, congo, is, thought, to, have, been, a, tone, language, with, two, contrastive, levels, synchronic, and, comparative, historical, studies, of, tone, systems, show, that, such, a, basic, system, can, easily, develop, more, tonal, contrasts, under, the, influence, of, depressor, consonants, or, through, the, introduction, of, a, downstep, languages, which, have, more, tonal, levels, tend, to, use, tone, more, for, lexical, and, less, for, grammatical, contrasts, niger, congo, languages, are, known, for, their, system, of, noun, classification, traces, of, which, can, be, found, in, every, branch, of, the, family, but, mande, ijoid, dogon, and, the, katla, and, rashad, branches, of, kordofanian, these, noun, classification, systems, are, somewhat, analogous, to, grammatical, gender, in, other, languages, but, there, are, often, a, fairly, large, number, of, classes, often, 10, or, more, and, the, classes, may, be, male, human, female, human, animate, inanimate, or, even, completely, gender, unrelated, categories, such, as, places, plants, abstracts, and, groups, of, objects, for, example, in, bantu, the, swahili, language, is, called, kiswahili, while, the, swahili, people, are, waswahili, likewise, in, ubangian, the, zande, language, is, called, pazande, while, the, zande, people, are, called, azande, in, the, bantu, languages, where, noun, classification, is, particularly, elaborate, it, typically, appears, as, prefixes, with, verbs, and, adjectives, marked, according, to, the, class, of, the, noun, they, refer, to, for, example, in, swahili, watu, wazuri, wataenda, is, good, zuri, people, tu, will, go, ta, enda, the, same, atlantic, congo, languages, which, have, noun, classes, also, have, a, set, of, verb, applicatives, and, other, verbal, extensions, such, as, the, reciprocal, suffix, na, swahili, penda, to, love, pendana, to, love, each, other, also, applicative, pendea, to, love, for, and, causative, pendeza, to, please, a, subject, verb, object, word, order, is, quite, widespread, among, today, s, niger, congo, languages, but, sov, is, found, in, branches, as, divergent, as, mande, ijoid, and, dogon, as, a, result, there, has, been, quite, some, debate, as, to, the, basic, word, order, of, niger, congo, whereas, claudi, 1993, argues, for, svo, on, the, basis, of, existing, svo, sov, grammaticalization, paths, gensler, 1997, points, out, that, the, notion, of, basic, word, order, is, problematic, as, it, excludes, structures, with, for, example, auxiliaries, however, the, structure, sc, oc, vbstem, subject, concord, object, concord, verb, stem, found, in, the, verbal, complex, of, the, svo, bantu, languages, suggests, an, earlier, sov, pattern, where, the, subject, and, object, were, at, least, represented, by, pronouns, noun, phrases, in, most, niger, congo, languages, are, characteristically, noun, initial, with, adjectives, numerals, demonstratives, and, genitives, all, coming, after, the, noun, the, major, exceptions, are, found, in, the, western, areas, where, verb, final, word, order, predominates, and, genitives, precede, nouns, though, other, modifiers, still, come, afterwards, degree, words, almost, always, follow, adjectives, and, except, in, verb, final, languages, adpositions, are, prepositional, the, verb, final, languages, of, the, mende, region, have, two, quite, unusual, word, order, characteristics, although, verbs, follow, their, direct, objects, oblique, adpositional, phrases, like, in, the, house, with, timber, typically, come, after, the, verb, creating, a, sovx, word, order, also, noteworthy, in, these, languages, is, the, prevalence, of, internally, headed, and, correlative, relative, clauses, in, both, of, which, the, head, occurs, inside, the, relative, clause, rather, than, the, main, clause, media, related, to, niger, congo, languages, at, wikimedia, commons
