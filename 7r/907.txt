the, military, industrial, complex, mic, is, a, phrase, originally, coined, by, u, s, president, dwight, d, eisenhower, to, describe, the, relationship, between, the, military, and, the, defense, industry, that, supplies, it, with, weapons, equipment, and, services, originally, the, military, industrial, complex, referred, to, the, nexus, of, defense, contractors, and, policymakers, that, existed, in, the, united, states, during, the, early, cold, war, but, it, has, since, been, applied, to, similar, arrangements, in, other, countries, and, time, periods, the, phrase, implies, a, commonality, of, interest, and, action, between, mic, actors, that, influences, public, policy, and, it, is, often, applied, in, a, critical, or, pejorative, sense, conceptually, it, is, closely, related, to, the, ideas, of, the, iron, triangle, the, three, sided, relationship, between, congress, the, executive, branch, bureaucracy, and, interest, groups, and, the, defense, industrial, base, the, network, of, organizations, facilities, and, resources, that, supplies, governments, with, defense, related, goods, and, services, u, s, president, dwight, d, eisenhower, originally, coined, the, term, in, his, farewell, address, to, the, nation, on, january, 17, 1961, a, vital, element, in, keeping, the, peace, is, our, military, establishment, our, arms, must, be, mighty, ready, for, instant, action, so, that, no, potential, aggressor, may, be, tempted, to, risk, his, own, destruction, this, conjunction, of, an, immense, military, establishment, and, a, large, arms, industry, is, new, in, the, american, experience, the, total, influence, economic, political, even, spiritual, is, felt, in, every, city, every, statehouse, every, office, of, the, federal, government, we, recognize, the, imperative, need, for, this, development, yet, we, must, not, fail, to, comprehend, its, grave, implications, our, toil, resources, and, livelihood, are, all, involved, so, is, the, very, structure, of, our, society, in, the, councils, of, government, we, must, guard, against, the, acquisition, of, unwarranted, influence, whether, sought, or, unsought, by, the, military, industrial, complex, the, potential, for, the, disastrous, rise, of, misplaced, power, exists, and, will, persist, we, must, never, let, the, weight, of, this, combination, endanger, our, liberties, or, democratic, processes, we, should, take, nothing, for, granted, only, an, alert, and, knowledgeable, citizenry, can, compel, the, proper, meshing, of, the, huge, industrial, and, military, machinery, of, defense, with, our, peaceful, methods, and, goals, so, that, security, and, liberty, may, prosper, together, the, phrase, was, thought, to, have, been, war, based, industrial, complex, before, becoming, military, in, later, drafts, of, eisenhower, s, speech, a, claim, passed, on, only, by, oral, history, geoffrey, perret, in, his, biography, of, eisenhower, claims, that, in, one, draft, of, the, speech, the, phrase, was, military, industrial, congressional, complex, indicating, the, essential, role, that, the, united, states, congress, plays, in, the, propagation, of, the, military, industry, but, the, word, congressional, was, dropped, from, the, final, version, to, appease, the, then, currently, elected, officials, james, ledbetter, calls, this, a, stubborn, misconception, not, supported, by, any, evidence, likewise, a, claim, by, douglas, brinkley, that, it, was, originally, military, industrial, scientific, complex, additionally, henry, giroux, claims, that, it, was, originally, military, industrial, academic, complex, the, actual, authors, of, the, speech, were, eisenhower, s, speechwriters, ralph, e, williams, and, malcolm, moos, attempts, to, conceptualize, something, similar, to, a, modern, military, industrial, complex, did, exist, before, 1961, as, the, underlying, phenomenon, described, by, the, term, is, generally, agreed, to, have, emerged, during, or, shortly, after, world, war, ii, for, example, a, similar, phrase, was, used, in, a, 1947, foreign, affairs, article, in, a, sense, close, to, that, it, would, later, acquire, and, sociologist, c, wright, mills, contended, in, his, 1956, book, the, power, elite, that, a, democratically, unaccountable, class, of, military, business, and, political, leaders, with, convergent, interests, exercised, the, preponderance, of, power, in, the, contemporary, west, some, sociologists, have, also, connected, it, to, harold, lasswell, s, concept, of, the, garrison, state, and, james, burnham, s, notion, of, the, managerial, revolution, however, following, its, coinage, in, eisenhower, s, address, the, mic, became, a, staple, of, american, political, and, sociological, discourse, many, vietnam, war, era, activists, and, polemicists, such, as, seymour, melman, and, noam, chomsky, employed, the, concept, in, their, criticism, of, u, s, foreign, policy, while, other, academics, and, policymakers, found, it, to, be, a, useful, analytical, framework, the, mic, was, often, advanced, as, both, a, symptom, and, a, cause, of, broader, dynamics, such, as, militarism, economic, centralization, and, the, influence, of, the, private, sector, over, public, policy, writing, in, 1968, for, example, one, economist, argued, that, in, the, case, of, the, mic, government, not, only, permits, and, facilitates, the, entrenchment, of, private, power, but, serves, as, its, fountain, head, it, creates, and, institutionalizes, power, concentrations, which, tend, to, breed, on, themselves, and, to, defy, public, control, lacking, a, network, of, government, owned, arsenals, such, as, produced, the, shot, and, cannon, in, the, days, of, american, innocence, or, having, dismantled, the, arsenals, it, did, have, the, government, is, forced, to, buy, what, it, no, longer, can, make, it, becomes, a, monopsonistic, buyer, of, products, which, are, not, yet, designed, or, for, which, production, experience, is, lacking, it, buys, at, prices, for, which, there, is, little, precedent, and, hardly, any, yardsticks, it, deals, with, contractors, a, large, percentage, of, whose, business, is, locked, into, supplying, defense, space, or, atomic, energy, needs, it, confronts, powerful, oligopolists, in, a, market, where, technical, capability, rather, than, price, is, the, controlling, variable, in, an, atmosphere, shrouded, by, multilateral, uncertainty, and, constant, warnings, about, imminent, aggression, although, the, mic, was, bound, up, in, its, origins, with, the, bipolar, international, environment, of, the, cold, war, some, contended, that, the, mic, might, endure, under, different, geopolitical, conditions, for, example, george, f, kennan, wrote, in, 1987, that, were, the, soviet, union, to, sink, tomorrow, under, the, waters, of, the, ocean, the, american, military, industrial, complex, would, have, to, remain, substantially, unchanged, until, some, other, adversary, could, be, invented, the, collapse, of, the, ussr, and, the, resultant, decrease, in, global, military, spending, the, so, called, peace, dividend, did, in, fact, lead, to, decreases, in, defense, industrial, output, and, consolidation, among, major, arms, producers, although, global, expenditures, rose, again, following, the, september, 11, terror, attacks, and, the, ensuing, global, war, on, terror, as, well, as, the, more, recent, increase, in, geopolitical, tensions, associated, with, strategic, competition, between, the, united, states, russia, and, china, through, to, the, present, the, military, industrial, complex, has, continued, to, be, seen, by, many, as, an, analytically, sound, and, important, concept, some, sources, divide, the, history, of, the, military, industrial, complex, into, three, distinct, eras, from, 1797, to, 1941, the, government, only, relied, on, civilian, industries, while, the, country, was, actually, at, war, the, government, owned, their, own, shipyards, and, weapons, manufacturing, facilities, which, they, relied, on, through, world, war, i, with, world, war, ii, came, a, massive, shift, in, the, way, that, the, u, s, government, armed, the, military, with, the, onset, of, world, war, ii, president, franklin, d, roosevelt, established, the, war, production, board, to, coordinate, civilian, industries, and, shift, them, into, wartime, production, throughout, world, war, ii, arms, production, in, the, united, states, went, from, around, one, percent, of, annual, gdp, to, 40, percent, of, gdp, various, u, s, companies, such, as, boeing, and, general, motors, maintained, and, expanded, their, defense, divisions, these, companies, have, gone, on, to, develop, various, technologies, that, have, improved, civilian, life, as, well, such, as, night, vision, goggles, and, gps, the, second, era, is, identified, as, beginning, with, the, coining, of, the, term, by, president, dwight, d, eisenhower, this, era, continued, through, the, cold, war, period, up, to, the, end, of, the, warsaw, pact, and, the, collapse, of, the, soviet, union, a, 1965, article, written, by, marc, pilisuk, and, thomas, hayden, says, benefits, of, the, military, industrial, complex, of, the, united, states, include, the, advancement, of, the, civilian, technology, market, as, civilian, companies, benefit, from, innovations, from, the, mic, and, vice, versa, in, 1993, the, pentagon, urged, defense, contractors, to, consolidate, due, to, the, fall, of, communism, and, a, shrinking, defense, budget, in, the, third, era, defense, contractors, either, consolidated, or, shifted, their, focus, to, civilian, innovation, from, 1992, to, 1997, there, was, a, total, of, us, 55, billion, worth, of, mergers, in, the, defense, industry, with, major, defense, companies, purchasing, smaller, competitors, the, u, s, domestic, economy, is, now, tied, directly, to, the, success, of, the, mic, which, has, led, to, concerns, of, repression, as, cold, war, era, attitudes, are, still, prevalent, among, the, american, public, shifts, in, values, and, the, collapse, of, communism, have, ushered, in, a, new, era, for, the, military, industrial, complex, the, department, of, defense, works, in, coordination, with, traditional, military, industrial, complex, aligned, companies, such, as, lockheed, martin, and, northrop, grumman, many, former, defense, contractors, have, shifted, operations, to, the, civilian, market, and, sold, off, their, defense, departments, according, to, the, military, subsidy, theory, the, cold, war, era, mass, production, of, aircraft, benefited, the, civilian, aircraft, industry, the, theory, asserts, that, the, technologies, developed, during, the, cold, war, along, with, the, financial, backing, of, the, military, led, to, the, dominance, of, u, s, aviation, companies, there, is, also, strong, evidence, that, the, united, states, federal, government, intentionally, paid, a, higher, price, for, these, innovations, to, serve, as, a, subsidy, for, civilian, aircraft, advancement, according, to, the, stockholm, international, peace, research, institute, sipri, total, world, spending, on, military, expenses, in, 2022, was, 2, 240, billion, 39, of, this, total, or, 837, billion, was, spent, by, the, united, states, china, was, the, second, largest, spender, with, 292, billion, and, 13, of, the, global, share, the, privatization, of, the, production, and, invention, of, military, technology, also, leads, to, a, complicated, relationship, with, significant, research, and, development, of, many, technologies, in, 2011, the, united, states, spent, more, in, absolute, numbers, on, its, military, than, the, next, 13, countries, combined, the, military, budget, of, the, united, states, for, the, 2009, fiscal, year, was, 515, 4, billion, adding, emergency, discretionary, spending, and, supplemental, spending, brings, the, sum, to, 651, 2, billion, this, does, not, include, many, military, related, items, that, are, outside, of, the, defense, department, s, budget, overall, the, u, s, federal, government, is, spending, about, 1, trillion, annually, on, military, related, purposes, president, joe, biden, signed, a, record, 886, billion, defense, spending, bill, into, law, on, december, 22, 2023, in, a, 2012, story, salon, reported, despite, a, decline, in, global, arms, sales, in, 2010, due, to, recessionary, pressures, the, united, states, increased, its, market, share, accounting, for, a, whopping, 53, percent, of, the, trade, that, year, last, year, saw, the, united, states, on, pace, to, deliver, more, than, 46, billion, in, foreign, arms, sales, the, military, and, arms, industry, also, tend, to, contribute, heavily, to, incumbent, members, of, congress, a, thesis, similar, to, the, military, industrial, complex, was, originally, expressed, by, daniel, gu, rin, in, his, 1936, book, fascism, and, big, business, about, the, fascist, government, ties, to, heavy, industry, it, can, be, defined, as, an, informal, and, changing, coalition, of, groups, with, vested, psychological, moral, and, material, interests, in, the, continuous, development, and, maintenance, of, high, levels, of, weaponry, in, preservation, of, colonial, markets, and, in, military, strategic, conceptions, of, internal, affairs, an, exhibit, of, the, trend, was, made, in, franz, leopold, neumann, s, book, behemoth, the, structure, and, practice, of, national, socialism, in, 1942, a, study, of, how, nazism, came, into, a, position, of, power, in, a, democratic, state, within, decades, of, its, inception, the, idea, of, the, military, industrial, complex, gave, rise, to, the, ideas, of, other, similar, industrial, complexes, including, ix, xxv, virtually, all, institutions, in, sectors, ranging, from, agriculture, medicine, entertainment, and, media, to, education, criminal, justice, security, and, transportation, began, reconceiving, and, reconstructing, in, accordance, with, capitalist, industrial, and, bureaucratic, models, with, the, aim, of, realizing, profit, growth, and, other, imperatives, according, to, steven, best, all, these, systems, interrelate, and, reinforce, one, another, the, concept, of, the, military, industrial, complex, has, been, also, expanded, to, include, the, entertainment, and, creative, industries, as, well, for, an, example, in, practice, matthew, brummer, describes, japan, s, manga, military, and, how, the, ministry, of, defense, uses, popular, culture, and, the, moe, that, it, engenders, to, shape, domestic, and, international, perceptions, an, alternative, term, to, describe, the, interdependence, between, the, military, industrial, complex, and, the, entertainment, industry, is, coined, by, james, der, derian, as, military, industrial, media, entertainment, network, ray, mcgovern, extended, this, appellation, to, military, industrial, congressional, intelligence, media, academia, think, tank, complex, micimatt
