surprise, pronunciation, is, a, rapid, fleeting, mental, and, physiological, state, it, is, related, to, the, startle, response, experienced, by, animals, and, humans, as, the, result, of, an, unexpected, event, surprise, can, have, any, valence, that, is, it, can, be, pleasant, positive, unpleasant, negative, or, neutral, moderate, surprise, can, occur, in, varying, levels, of, intensity, ranging, from, very, surprised, which, may, induce, the, fight, or, flight, response, or, slightly, surprised, which, elicits, a, less, intense, response, to, the, stimulus, surprise, is, included, as, a, primary, or, basic, emotion, in, the, taxonomies, of, carroll, izard, and, paul, ekman, according, to, these, perspectives, surprise, is, evolutionarily, adaptive, and, also, innate, and, universal, across, human, cultures, surprise, is, intimately, connected, to, the, idea, of, acting, in, accordance, with, a, set, of, rules, when, the, rules, of, reality, generating, events, of, daily, life, separate, from, the, rule, of, thumb, expectations, surprise, is, the, outcome, surprise, represents, the, difference, between, expectations, and, reality, the, gap, between, our, assumptions, and, expectations, about, worldly, events, and, the, way, that, those, events, actually, turn, out, this, gap, can, be, deemed, an, important, foundation, on, which, new, findings, are, based, since, surprises, can, make, people, aware, of, their, own, ignorance, the, acknowledgement, of, ignorance, in, turn, can, mean, a, window, to, new, knowledge, surprise, can, also, occur, due, to, a, violation, of, expectancies, in, the, specific, case, of, interpersonal, communication, the, expectancy, violation, theory, evt, says, that, three, factors, influence, a, person, s, expectations, interactant, variables, environmental, variables, and, variables, related, to, the, nature, of, the, interaction, or, environmental, variables, surprise, may, occur, due, to, a, violation, of, one, two, or, a, combination, of, all, three, factors, surprise, does, not, always, have, to, have, a, negative, valence, evt, proposes, that, expectancy, s, will, influence, the, outcome, of, the, communication, as, a, confirmation, behaviors, within, the, expected, range, or, violation, behaviors, outside, the, expected, range, evt, also, postulates, that, positive, interactions, will, increase, the, level, of, attraction, of, the, violator, whereas, negative, violations, decrease, the, attraction, positive, violations, would, then, cause, positive, surprise, such, as, a, surprise, birthday, party, and, negative, violations, would, cause, negative, surprise, such, as, a, parking, ticket, positive, violations, may, enhance, credibility, power, attraction, and, persuasiveness, negative, violations, may, reduce, them, the, physiological, response, of, surprise, falls, under, the, category, of, the, startle, response, the, main, function, of, surprise, or, the, startle, response, is, to, interrupt, an, ongoing, action, and, reorient, attention, to, a, new, possibly, significant, event, there, is, an, automatic, redirection, of, focus, to, the, new, stimuli, and, for, a, brief, moment, this, causes, tenseness, in, the, muscles, especially, the, neck, muscles, studies, show, that, this, response, happens, extremely, fast, with, information, in, this, case, a, loud, noise, reaching, the, pons, within, 3, to, 8, ms, and, the, full, startle, reflex, occurring, in, less, than, two, tenths, of, a, second, if, the, startle, response, is, strongly, elicited, through, surprise, then, it, will, bring, on, the, fight, or, flight, response, which, is, a, perceived, harmful, event, attack, or, threat, to, survival, that, causes, a, release, of, adrenaline, for, a, boost, of, energy, as, a, means, to, escape, or, fight, this, response, generally, has, a, negative, valence, in, terms, of, surprise, surprise, has, one, core, appraisal, appraising, something, as, new, and, unexpected, but, new, appraisals, can, shift, the, experience, of, surprise, to, another, appraising, an, event, as, new, predicts, surprise, but, the, appraisal, of, the, coping, mechanism, predicts, the, response, beyond, surprise, such, as, confusion, or, interest, surprise, is, expressed, in, the, face, by, the, following, features, spontaneous, involuntary, surprise, is, often, expressed, for, only, a, fraction, of, a, second, it, may, be, followed, immediately, by, the, emotion, of, fear, joy, or, confusion, the, intensity, of, the, surprise, is, associated, with, how, much, the, jaw, drops, but, the, mouth, may, not, open, at, all, in, some, cases, the, raising, of, the, eyebrows, at, least, momentarily, is, the, most, distinctive, and, predictable, sign, of, surprise, despite, the, facial, feedback, hypothesis, that, facial, display, is, necessary, in, the, experience, of, emotion, or, a, major, determinant, of, feelings, in, the, case, of, surprise, some, research, has, shown, a, strong, lack, of, connection, between, the, facial, display, of, surprise, and, the, actual, experience, of, surprise, this, suggests, that, there, are, variations, in, the, expression, of, surprise, it, has, been, suggested, that, surprise, is, an, envelope, term, for, both, the, startle, response, and, also, disbelief, more, recent, research, shows, that, raising, of, the, eyebrows, does, provide, facial, feedback, to, disbelief, but, not, to, the, startle, pupil, dilation, and, constriction, can, determine, the, valence, of, surprise, from, the, action, to, the, reaction, of, the, individual, positive, valence, to, surprise, is, shown, through, a, dilation, or, expansion, of, the, pupil, where, as, negative, valence, in, surprise, is, associated, with, pupil, constriction, but, newer, studies, show, pupil, dilation, for, negative, as, well, as, positive, stimuli, indicating, a, general, autonomous, arousal, associated, with, pupil, dilation, and, not, affective, valence, non, verbal, responses, to, surprise, can, also, be, affected, by, voice, inflection, distance, time, environment, volume, rate, quality, pitch, speaking, style, and, even, the, level, of, eye, contact, made, by, an, individual, trying, to, cause, a, surprise, these, non, verbal, cues, help, to, define, whether, the, perceived, surprise, will, have, a, positive, or, negative, valence, and, to, what, degree, the, surprise, will, be, induced, by, the, individual, linguistics, may, play, a, role, in, the, formulation, of, surprise, the, language, expectancy, theory, let, states, that, people, develop, norms, and, expectations, concerning, appropriate, usage, of, a, language, in, a, given, situation, when, norms, or, expectations, of, verbal, language, are, violated, surprise, may, occur, the, evt, model, supports, that, expectations, can, be, violated, verbally, and, this, violation, may, cause, a, surprise, within, the, individual, expectations, of, verbal, language, that, may, lead, to, surprise, may, include, but, are, not, limited, to, expletives, shouts, screams, and, gasps, the, aforementioned, expectations, of, verbal, language, are, more, closely, associated, to, negative, expectancies, of, surprise, but, positive, surprise, can, occur, from, verbal, interaction, as, well, a, positive, violation, of, expectations, that, could, result, in, a, positive, surprise, may, include, a, low, credibility, source, making, a, persuasive, argument, that, leads, to, the, change, of, beliefs, or, emotions, thus, enhancing, the, speaker, s, credibility, the, move, from, a, low, credibility, source, to, a, high, credibility, source, can, elicit, a, positive, surprise, among, individuals, the, act, of, being, persuaded, by, said, speaker, can, also, elicit, a, positive, surprise, as, an, individual, may, have, perceived, the, speaker, as, having, too, low, of, a, credibility, to, elicit, change, and, the, change, of, beliefs, or, emotion, then, causes, surprise, as, individuals, become, more, accustomed, to, particular, types, of, surprise, over, time, the, level, of, surprise, will, decrease, in, intensity, this, does, not, necessarily, mean, that, an, individual, for, instance, will, not, be, surprised, during, the, jump, scene, of, a, scary, movie, it, implies, that, the, individual, may, expect, the, jump, scene, due, to, familiarity, with, scary, movies, thus, lowering, the, level, of, surprise, the, evt, model, helps, to, support, this, claim, because, as, individuals, become, more, accustomed, to, a, situation, or, communication, it, becomes, less, and, less, likely, that, the, situation, or, communication, will, cause, a, violation, of, expectation, and, without, violating, an, expectation, surprise, cannot, occur
