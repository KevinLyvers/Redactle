gender, equality, also, known, as, sexual, equality, or, equality, of, the, sexes, is, the, state, of, equal, ease, of, access, to, resources, and, opportunities, regardless, of, gender, including, economic, participation, and, decision, making, and, the, state, of, valuing, different, behaviors, aspirations, and, needs, equally, also, regardless, of, gender, unicef, an, agency, of, the, united, nations, defines, gender, equality, as, women, and, men, and, girls, and, boys, enjoy, the, same, rights, resources, opportunities, and, protections, it, does, not, require, that, girls, and, boys, or, women, and, men, be, the, same, or, that, they, be, treated, exactly, alike, as, of, 2017, gender, equality, is, the, fifth, of, seventeen, sustainable, development, goals, sdg, 5, of, the, united, nations, gender, equality, has, not, incorporated, the, proposition, of, genders, besides, women, and, men, or, gender, identities, outside, of, the, gender, binary, gender, inequality, is, measured, annually, by, the, united, nations, development, programme, s, human, development, reports, gender, equality, can, refer, to, equal, opportunities, or, formal, equality, based, on, gender, or, refer, to, equal, representation, or, equality, of, outcomes, for, gender, also, called, substantive, equality, gender, equality, is, the, goal, while, gender, neutrality, and, gender, equity, are, practices, and, ways, of, thinking, that, help, achieve, the, goal, gender, parity, which, is, used, to, measure, gender, balance, in, a, given, situation, can, aid, in, achieving, substantive, gender, equality, but, is, not, the, goal, in, and, of, itself, gender, equality, is, strongly, tied, to, women, s, rights, and, often, requires, policy, changes, on, a, global, scale, achieving, gender, equality, also, requires, eliminating, harmful, practices, against, women, and, girls, including, sex, trafficking, femicide, wartime, sexual, violence, gender, wage, gap, and, other, oppression, tactics, unfpa, stated, that, despite, many, international, agreements, affirming, their, human, rights, women, are, still, much, more, likely, than, men, to, be, poor, and, illiterate, they, have, less, access, to, property, ownership, credit, training, and, employment, this, partly, stems, from, the, archaic, stereotypes, of, women, being, labeled, as, child, bearers, and, homemakers, rather, than, the, breadwinners, of, the, family, they, are, far, less, likely, than, men, to, be, politically, active, and, far, more, likely, to, be, victims, of, domestic, violence, christine, de, pizan, an, early, advocate, for, gender, equality, states, in, her, 1405, book, the, book, of, the, city, of, ladies, that, the, oppression, of, women, is, founded, on, irrational, prejudice, pointing, out, numerous, advances, in, society, probably, created, by, women, the, shakers, an, evangelical, group, which, practiced, segregation, of, the, sexes, and, strict, celibacy, were, early, practitioners, of, gender, equality, they, branched, off, from, a, quaker, community, in, the, north, west, of, england, before, emigrating, to, america, in, 1774, in, america, the, head, of, the, shakers, central, ministry, in, 1788, joseph, meacham, had, a, revelation, that, the, sexes, should, be, equal, he, then, brought, lucy, wright, into, the, ministry, as, his, female, counterpart, and, together, they, restructured, the, society, to, balance, the, rights, of, the, sexes, meacham, and, wright, established, leadership, teams, where, each, elder, who, dealt, with, the, men, s, spiritual, welfare, was, partnered, with, an, eldress, who, did, the, same, for, women, each, deacon, was, partnered, with, a, deaconess, men, had, oversight, of, men, women, had, oversight, of, women, women, lived, with, women, men, lived, with, men, in, shaker, society, a, woman, did, not, have, to, be, controlled, or, owned, by, any, man, after, meacham, s, death, in, 1796, wright, became, the, head, of, the, shaker, ministry, until, her, death, in, 1821, shakers, maintained, the, same, pattern, of, gender, balanced, leadership, for, more, than, 200, years, they, also, promoted, equality, by, working, together, with, other, women, s, rights, advocates, in, 1859, shaker, elder, frederick, evans, stated, their, beliefs, forcefully, writing, that, shakers, were, the, first, to, disenthrall, woman, from, the, condition, of, vassalage, to, which, all, other, religious, systems, more, or, less, consign, her, and, to, secure, to, her, those, just, and, equal, rights, with, man, that, by, her, similarity, to, him, in, organization, and, faculties, both, god, and, nature, would, seem, to, demand, evans, and, his, counterpart, eldress, antoinette, doolittle, joined, women, s, rights, advocates, on, speakers, platforms, throughout, the, northeastern, u, s, in, the, 1870s, a, visitor, to, the, shakers, wrote, in, 1875, each, sex, works, in, its, own, appropriate, sphere, of, action, there, being, a, proper, subordination, deference, and, respect, of, the, female, to, the, male, in, his, order, and, of, the, male, to, the, female, in, her, order, so, that, in, any, of, these, communities, the, zealous, advocates, of, women, s, rights, may, here, find, a, practical, realization, of, their, ideal, the, shakers, were, more, than, a, radical, religious, sect, on, the, fringes, of, american, society, they, put, equality, of, the, sexes, into, practice, it, has, been, argued, that, they, demonstrated, that, gender, equality, was, achievable, and, how, to, achieve, it, in, wider, society, the, movement, towards, gender, equality, began, with, the, suffrage, movement, in, western, cultures, in, the, late, 19th, century, which, sought, to, allow, women, to, vote, and, hold, elected, office, this, period, also, witnessed, significant, changes, to, women, s, property, rights, particularly, in, relation, to, their, marital, status, see, for, example, married, women, s, property, act, 1882, since, world, war, ii, the, women, s, liberation, movement, and, feminism, have, created, a, general, movement, towards, recognition, of, women, s, rights, the, united, nations, and, other, international, agencies, have, adopted, several, conventions, which, promote, gender, equality, these, conventions, have, not, been, uniformly, adopted, by, all, countries, and, include, such, legislation, and, affirmative, action, policies, have, been, critical, to, bringing, changes, in, societal, attitudes, a, 2015, pew, research, center, survey, of, citizens, in, 38, countries, found, that, majorities, in, 37, of, those, 38, countries, said, that, gender, equality, is, at, least, somewhat, important, and, a, global, median, of, 65, believe, it, is, very, important, that, women, have, the, same, rights, as, men, most, occupations, are, now, equally, available, to, men, and, women, in, many, countries, similarly, men, are, increasingly, working, in, occupations, which, in, previous, generations, had, been, considered, women, s, work, such, as, nursing, cleaning, and, child, care, in, domestic, situations, the, role, of, parenting, or, child, rearing, is, more, commonly, shared, or, not, as, widely, considered, to, be, an, exclusively, female, role, so, that, women, may, be, free, to, pursue, a, career, after, childbirth, for, further, information, see, shared, earning, shared, parenting, marriage, another, manifestation, of, the, change, in, social, attitudes, is, the, non, automatic, taking, by, a, woman, of, her, husband, s, surname, on, marriage, a, highly, contentious, issue, relating, to, gender, equality, is, the, role, of, women, in, religiously, orientated, societies, some, christians, or, muslims, believe, in, complementarianism, a, view, that, holds, that, men, and, women, have, different, but, complementing, roles, this, view, may, be, in, opposition, to, the, views, and, goals, of, gender, equality, in, addition, there, are, also, non, western, countries, of, low, religiosity, where, the, contention, surrounding, gender, equality, remains, in, china, a, cultural, preference, for, a, male, child, has, resulted, in, a, shortfall, of, women, in, the, population, the, feminist, movement, in, japan, has, made, many, strides, which, resulted, in, the, gender, equality, bureau, but, japan, still, remains, low, in, gender, equality, compared, to, other, industrialized, nations, developing, countries, like, kenya, on, the, other, hand, do, not, have, official, national, statistics, and, have, to, rely, on, some, gender, disaggregated, statistics, usually, funded, by, international, organizations, for, their, analysis, the, notion, of, gender, equality, and, of, its, degree, of, achievement, in, a, certain, country, is, very, complex, because, there, are, countries, that, have, a, history, of, a, high, level, of, gender, equality, in, certain, areas, of, life, but, not, in, other, areas, indeed, there, is, a, need, for, caution, when, categorizing, countries, by, the, level, of, gender, equality, that, they, have, achieved, according, to, mala, htun, and, s, laurel, weldon, gender, policy, is, not, one, issue, but, many, and, when, costa, rica, has, a, better, maternity, leave, than, the, united, states, and, latin, american, countries, are, quicker, to, adopt, policies, addressing, violence, against, women, than, the, nordic, countries, one, at, least, ought, to, consider, the, possibility, that, fresh, ways, of, grouping, states, would, further, the, study, of, gender, politics, not, all, beliefs, relating, to, gender, equality, have, been, popularly, adopted, for, example, topfreedom, the, right, to, be, bare, breasted, in, public, frequently, applies, only, to, males, and, has, remained, a, marginal, issue, breastfeeding, in, public, is, now, more, commonly, tolerated, especially, in, semi, private, places, such, as, restaurants, it, is, the, vision, that, men, and, women, should, be, treated, equally, in, social, economic, and, all, other, aspects, of, society, and, to, not, be, discriminated, against, on, the, basis, of, their, gender, gender, equality, is, one, of, the, objectives, of, the, united, nations, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, world, bodies, have, defined, gender, equality, in, terms, of, human, rights, especially, women, s, rights, and, economic, development, the, united, nation, s, millennium, development, goals, report, states, that, their, goal, is, to, achieve, gender, equality, and, the, empowerment, of, women, despite, economic, struggles, in, developing, countries, the, united, nations, is, still, trying, to, promote, gender, equality, as, well, as, help, create, a, sustainable, living, environment, is, all, its, nations, their, goals, also, include, giving, women, who, work, certain, full, time, jobs, equal, pay, to, the, men, with, the, same, job, a, study, involving, predicting, personality, characteristics, of, individuals, in, photographs, across, 44, countries, found, that, the, women, are, wonderful, effect, is, lower, in, countries, with, high, measures, of, gender, equality, with, the, decrease, arising, from, men, being, viewed, less, negatively, the, gender, equality, paradox, is, the, observation, that, gendered, differences, in, personality, tend, to, be, higher, in, countries, with, higher, gender, equality, there, has, been, criticism, from, some, feminists, towards, the, political, discourse, and, policies, employed, in, order, to, achieve, the, above, items, of, progress, in, gender, equality, with, critics, arguing, that, these, gender, equality, strategies, are, superficial, in, that, they, do, not, seek, to, challenge, social, structures, of, male, domination, and, only, aim, to, improve, the, situation, of, women, within, the, societal, framework, of, subordination, of, women, to, men, and, that, official, public, policies, such, as, state, policies, or, international, bodies, policies, are, questionable, as, they, are, applied, in, a, patriarchal, context, and, are, directly, or, indirectly, controlled, by, agents, of, a, system, which, is, for, the, most, part, male, one, of, the, criticisms, of, the, gender, equality, policies, in, particular, those, of, the, european, union, is, that, they, disproportionately, focus, on, policies, integrating, women, in, public, life, but, do, not, seek, to, genuinely, address, the, deep, private, sphere, oppression, a, criticism, of, the, western, concept, and, policies, of, gender, equality, relates, to, the, degree, to, which, this, approach, is, able, to, genuinely, address, in, a, successful, way, the, problem, of, violence, against, women, a, further, criticism, is, that, a, focus, on, the, situation, of, women, in, non, western, countries, while, often, ignoring, the, issues, that, exist, in, the, west, is, a, form, of, imperialism, and, of, reinforcing, western, moral, superiority, and, a, way, of, othering, of, domestic, violence, by, presenting, it, as, something, specific, to, outsiders, the, violent, others, and, not, to, the, allegedly, progressive, western, cultures, these, critics, point, out, that, women, in, western, countries, often, face, similar, problems, such, as, domestic, violence, and, rape, as, in, other, parts, of, the, world, they, also, cite, the, fact, that, women, faced, de, jure, legal, discrimination, until, just, a, few, decades, ago, for, instance, in, some, western, countries, such, as, switzerland, greece, spain, and, france, women, obtained, equal, rights, in, family, law, in, the, 1980s, another, criticism, is, that, there, is, a, selective, public, discourse, with, regard, to, different, types, of, oppression, of, women, with, some, forms, of, violence, such, as, honor, killings, most, common, in, certain, geographic, regions, such, as, parts, of, asia, and, north, africa, being, frequently, the, object, of, public, debate, while, other, forms, of, violence, such, as, the, lenient, punishment, for, crimes, of, passion, across, latin, america, do, not, receive, the, same, attention, in, the, west, it, is, also, argued, that, the, criticism, of, particular, laws, of, many, developing, countries, ignores, the, influence, of, colonialism, on, those, legal, systems, there, has, been, controversy, surrounding, the, concepts, of, westernization, and, europeanisation, due, to, their, reminder, of, past, colonialism, and, also, due, to, the, fact, that, some, western, countries, such, as, switzerland, have, been, themselves, been, very, slow, to, give, women, legal, rights, there, have, also, been, objections, to, the, way, western, media, presents, women, from, various, cultures, creating, stereotypes, such, as, that, of, submissive, asian, or, eastern, european, women, a, stereotype, closely, connected, to, the, mail, order, brides, industry, such, stereotypes, are, often, blatantly, untrue, for, instance, women, in, many, eastern, european, countries, occupy, a, high, professional, status, feminists, in, many, developing, countries, have, been, strongly, opposed, to, the, idea, that, women, in, those, countries, need, to, be, saved, by, the, west, there, are, questions, on, how, exactly, should, gender, equality, be, measured, and, whether, the, west, is, indeed, best, at, it, a, study, in, 2010, found, that, among, the, top, 20, countries, on, female, graduates, in, the, science, fields, at, university, level, most, countries, were, countries, that, were, considered, internationally, to, score, very, low, on, the, position, of, women, s, rights, with, the, top, 3, being, iran, saudi, arabia, and, oman, and, only, 5, european, countries, made, it, to, that, top, romania, bulgaria, italy, georgia, and, greece, controversy, regarding, western, cultural, influence, in, the, world, is, not, new, in, the, late, 1940s, when, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, was, being, drafted, the, american, anthropological, association, warned, that, the, document, would, be, defining, universal, rights, from, a, western, perspective, which, could, be, detrimental, to, non, western, countries, and, further, argued, that, the, west, s, history, of, colonialism, and, forceful, interference, with, other, societies, made, them, a, problematic, moral, representative, for, universal, global, standards, there, has, been, criticism, that, international, law, international, courts, and, universal, gender, neutral, concepts, of, human, rights, are, at, best, silent, on, many, of, the, issues, important, to, women, and, at, worst, male, centered, considering, the, male, person, to, be, the, default, excessive, gender, neutrality, can, worsen, the, situation, of, women, because, the, law, assumes, women, are, in, the, same, position, as, men, ignoring, the, biological, fact, that, in, the, process, of, reproduction, and, pregnancy, there, is, no, equality, and, that, apart, from, physical, differences, there, are, socially, constructed, limitations, which, assign, a, socially, and, culturally, inferior, position, to, women, a, situation, which, requires, a, specific, approach, to, women, s, rights, not, merely, a, gender, neutral, one, in, a, 1975, interview, simone, de, beauvoir, talked, about, the, negative, reactions, towards, women, s, rights, from, the, left, that, was, supposed, to, be, progressive, and, support, social, change, and, also, expressed, skepticism, about, mainstream, international, organizations, there, have, been, questions, about, the, acceptability, of, international, intervention, into, societal, domestic, issues, from, international, organizations, especially, since, the, multitude, of, such, international, bodies, can, create, confusion, including, through, contradictory, rulings, on, the, same, issue, for, example, the, ecthr, upheld, in, 2014, france, s, ban, on, wearing, a, burqa, in, public, while, the, united, nations, human, rights, committee, concluded, in, 2018, that, france, s, ban, on, burqa, in, public, violates, human, rights, international, bodies, have, been, criticized, for, being, based, on, an, ideology, of, one, size, fits, all, approach, to, issues, which, does, not, take, into, account, that, a, specific, approach, may, work, in, one, culture, but, not, in, another, and, that, historically, international, intervention, into, another, country, has, often, done, more, harm, than, good, and, that, ultimately, the, problems, from, a, culture, must, be, solved, from, within, that, culture, not, through, forceful, foreign, intervention, a, criticism, of, international, organizations, is, that, while, they, purport, to, support, universal, global, human, rights, they, often, support, the, interests, of, western, elites, the, legitimacy, of, international, organizations, has, come, into, question, in, the, 21st, century, especially, in, the, light, of, international, scandals, such, as, child, sexual, abuse, by, un, peacekeepers, in, 2010, the, european, union, opened, the, european, institute, for, gender, equality, eige, in, vilnius, lithuania, to, promote, gender, equality, and, to, fight, sex, discrimination, in, 2015, the, eu, published, the, gender, action, plan, 2016, 2020, gender, equality, is, part, of, the, national, curriculum, in, great, britain, and, many, other, european, countries, by, presidential, decree, the, republic, of, kazakhstan, created, a, strategy, for, gender, equality, 2006, 2016, to, chart, the, subsequent, decade, of, gender, equality, efforts, personal, social, health, and, economic, education, religious, studies, and, language, acquisition, curricula, tend, to, address, gender, equality, issues, as, a, very, serious, topic, for, discussion, and, analysis, of, its, effect, in, society, a, large, and, growing, body, of, research, has, shown, how, gender, inequality, undermines, health, and, development, to, overcome, gender, inequality, the, united, nations, population, fund, states, that, women, s, empowerment, and, gender, equality, requires, strategic, interventions, at, all, levels, of, programming, and, policy, making, these, levels, include, reproductive, health, economic, empowerment, educational, empowerment, and, political, empowerment, unfpa, says, that, research, has, also, demonstrated, how, working, with, men, and, boys, as, well, as, women, and, girls, to, promote, gender, equality, contributes, to, achieving, health, and, development, outcomes, the, extent, to, which, national, policy, frameworks, address, gender, issues, improved, over, the, past, decade, national, policies, and, budgets, in, east, africa, and, latin, america, for, example, have, increasingly, highlighted, structural, gaps, in, access, to, land, inputs, services, finance, and, digital, technology, and, included, efforts, to, produce, gender, responsive, outcomes, however, the, extent, to, which, agricultural, policies, specifically, address, gender, equality, and, women, s, empowerment, varies, even, though, more, than, 75, percent, of, agricultural, policies, that, the, food, and, agriculture, organization, analysed, recognized, women, s, roles, and, or, challenges, in, agriculture, only, 19, percent, had, gender, equality, in, agriculture, or, women, s, rights, as, explicit, policy, objectives, and, only, 13, percent, encouraged, rural, women, s, participation, in, the, policy, cycle, social, constructs, of, gender, that, is, cultural, ideals, of, socially, acceptable, masculinity, and, femininity, often, have, a, negative, effect, on, health, the, world, health, organization, cites, the, example, of, women, not, being, allowed, to, travel, alone, outside, the, home, to, go, to, the, hospital, and, women, being, prevented, by, cultural, norms, to, ask, their, husbands, to, use, a, condom, in, cultures, which, simultaneously, encourage, male, promiscuity, as, social, norms, that, harm, women, s, health, teenage, boys, suffering, accidents, due, to, social, expectations, of, impressing, their, peers, through, risk, taking, and, men, dying, at, much, higher, rate, from, lung, cancer, due, to, smoking, in, cultures, which, link, smoking, to, masculinity, are, cited, by, the, who, as, examples, of, gender, norms, negatively, affecting, men, s, health, the, world, health, organization, has, also, stated, that, there, is, a, strong, connection, between, gender, socialization, and, transmission, and, lack, of, adequate, management, of, hiv, aids, certain, cultural, practices, such, as, female, genital, mutilation, fgm, negatively, affect, women, s, health, female, genital, mutilation, is, the, ritual, cutting, or, removal, of, some, or, all, of, the, external, female, genitalia, it, is, rooted, in, inequality, between, the, sexes, and, constitutes, a, form, of, discrimination, against, women, the, practice, is, found, in, africa, asia, and, the, middle, east, and, among, immigrant, communities, from, countries, in, which, fgm, is, common, the, preference, rate, in, kenya, is, 21, per, cent, and, an, estimated, 4, million, girls, and, women, have, undergone, fgm, in, kenya, with, hot, spot, areas, communities, including, the, kuria, community, both, in, kenya, and, tanzania, border, kisii, maasai, somali, samburu, and, kuria, ethnic, groups, unicef, estimated, in, 2016, that, 200, million, women, have, undergone, the, procedure, according, to, the, world, health, organization, gender, equality, can, improve, men, s, health, the, study, shows, that, traditional, notions, of, masculinity, have, a, big, impact, on, men, s, health, among, european, men, non, communicable, diseases, such, as, cancer, cardiovascular, diseases, respiratory, illnesses, and, diabetes, account, for, the, vast, majority, of, deaths, of, men, aged, 30, 59, in, europe, which, are, often, linked, to, unhealthy, diets, stress, substance, abuse, and, other, habits, which, the, report, connects, to, behaviors, often, stereotypically, seen, as, masculine, behaviors, like, heavy, drinking, and, smoking, traditional, gender, stereotypes, that, keep, men, in, the, role, of, breadwinner, and, systematic, discrimination, preventing, women, from, equally, contributing, to, their, households, and, participating, in, the, workforce, can, put, additional, stress, on, men, increasing, their, risk, of, health, issues, and, men, bolstered, by, cultural, norms, tend, to, take, more, risks, and, engage, in, interpersonal, violence, more, often, than, women, which, could, result, in, fatal, injuries, violence, against, women, vaw, is, a, technical, term, used, to, collectively, refer, to, violent, acts, that, are, primarily, or, exclusively, committed, against, women, this, type, of, violence, is, gender, based, meaning, that, the, acts, of, violence, are, committed, against, women, expressly, because, they, are, women, or, as, a, result, of, patriarchal, gender, constructs, violence, and, mistreatment, of, women, in, marriage, has, come, to, international, attention, during, the, past, decades, this, includes, both, violence, committed, inside, marriage, domestic, violence, as, well, as, violence, related, to, marriage, customs, and, traditions, such, as, dowry, bride, price, forced, marriage, and, child, marriage, according, to, some, theories, violence, against, women, is, often, caused, by, the, acceptance, of, violence, by, various, cultural, groups, as, a, means, of, conflict, resolution, within, intimate, relationships, studies, on, intimate, partner, violence, victimization, among, ethnic, minorities, in, the, united, studies, have, consistently, revealed, that, immigrants, are, a, high, risk, group, for, intimate, violence, in, countries, where, gang, murders, armed, kidnappings, civil, unrest, and, other, similar, acts, are, rare, the, vast, majority, of, murdered, women, are, killed, by, partners, ex, partners, by, contrast, in, countries, with, a, high, level, of, organized, criminal, activity, and, gang, violence, murders, of, women, are, more, likely, to, occur, in, a, public, sphere, often, in, a, general, climate, of, indifference, and, impunity, in, addition, many, countries, do, not, have, adequate, comprehensive, data, collection, on, such, murders, aggravating, the, problem, in, some, parts, of, the, world, various, forms, of, violence, against, women, are, tolerated, and, accepted, as, parts, of, everyday, life, in, most, countries, it, is, only, in, more, recent, decades, that, domestic, violence, against, women, has, received, significant, legal, attention, the, istanbul, convention, acknowledges, the, long, tradition, of, european, countries, of, ignoring, this, form, of, violence, in, some, cultures, acts, of, violence, against, women, are, seen, as, crimes, against, the, male, owners, of, the, woman, such, as, husband, father, or, male, relatives, rather, the, woman, herself, this, leads, to, practices, where, men, inflict, violence, upon, women, in, order, to, get, revenge, on, male, members, of, the, women, s, family, such, practices, include, payback, rape, a, form, of, rape, specific, to, certain, cultures, particularly, the, pacific, islands, which, consists, of, the, rape, of, a, female, usually, by, a, group, of, several, males, as, revenge, for, acts, committed, by, members, of, her, family, such, as, her, father, or, brothers, with, the, rape, being, meant, to, humiliate, the, father, or, brothers, as, punishment, for, their, prior, behavior, towards, the, perpetrators, richard, a, posner, writes, that, traditionally, rape, was, the, offense, of, depriving,

the, european, union, member, states, in, some, western, countries, women, have, only, recently, obtained, the, right, to, vote, in, 2015, 61, 3, of, rwanda, s, lower, house, of, parliament, were, women, the, highest, proportion, anywhere, in, the, world, but, worldwide, that, was, one, of, only, two, such, bodies, where, women, were, in, the, majority, the, other, being, bolivia, s, lower, house, of, parliament, see, also, gender, equality, in, rwanda, equal, rights, for, women, in, marriage, divorce, and, property, land, ownership, and, inheritance, are, essential, for, gender, equality, the, convention, on, the, elimination, of, all, forms, of, discrimination, against, women, cedaw, has, called, for, the, end, of, discriminatory, family, laws, in, 2013, un, women, stated, that, while, at, least, 115, countries, recognize, equal, land, rights, for, women, and, men, effective, implementation, remains, a, major, challenge, the, legal, and, social, treatment, of, married, women, has, been, often, discussed, as, a, political, issue, from, the, 19th, century, onwards, until, the, 1970s, legal, subordination, of, married, women, was, common, across, european, countries, through, marriage, laws, giving, legal, authority, to, the, husband, as, well, as, through, marriage, bars, in, 1978, the, council, of, europe, passed, the, resolution, 78, 37, on, equality, of, spouses, in, civil, law, switzerland, was, one, of, the, last, countries, in, europe, to, establish, gender, equality, in, marriage, in, this, country, married, women, s, rights, were, severely, restricted, until, 1988, when, legal, reforms, providing, for, gender, equality, in, marriage, abolishing, the, legal, authority, of, the, husband, come, into, force, these, reforms, had, been, approved, in, 1985, by, voters, in, a, referendum, who, narrowly, voted, in, favor, with, 54, 7, of, voters, approving, in, the, netherlands, it, was, only, in, 1984, that, full, legal, equality, between, husband, and, wife, was, achieved, prior, to, 1984, the, law, stipulated, that, the, husband, s, opinion, prevailed, over, the, wife, s, regarding, issues, such, as, decisions, on, children, s, education, and, the, domicile, of, the, family, in, the, united, states, a, wife, s, legal, subordination, to, her, husband, was, fully, ended, by, the, case, of, kirchberg, v, feenstra, 450, u, s, 455, 1981, a, united, states, supreme, court, case, in, which, the, court, held, a, louisiana, head, and, master, law, which, gave, sole, control, of, marital, property, to, the, husband, unconstitutional, there, have, been, and, sometimes, continue, to, be, unequal, treatment, of, married, women, in, various, aspects, of, everyday, life, for, example, in, australia, until, 1983, a, husband, had, to, authorize, an, application, for, an, australian, passport, for, a, married, woman, other, practices, have, included, and, in, many, countries, continue, to, include, a, requirement, for, a, husband, s, consent, for, an, application, for, bank, loans, and, credit, cards, by, a, married, woman, as, well, as, restrictions, on, the, wife, s, reproductive, rights, such, as, a, requirement, that, the, husband, consents, to, the, wife, s, acquiring, contraception, or, having, an, abortion, in, some, places, although, the, law, itself, no, longer, requires, the, consent, of, the, husband, for, various, actions, taken, by, the, wife, the, practice, continues, de, facto, with, the, authorization, of, the, husband, being, asked, in, practice, although, dowry, is, today, mainly, associated, with, south, asia, the, practice, has, been, common, until, the, mid, 20th, century, in, parts, of, southeast, europe, laws, regulating, marriage, and, divorce, continue, to, discriminate, against, women, in, many, countries, in, iraq, husbands, have, a, legal, right, to, punish, their, wives, with, paragraph, 41, of, the, criminal, code, stating, that, there, is, no, crime, if, an, act, is, committed, while, exercising, a, legal, right, in, the, 1990s, and, the, 21st, century, there, has, been, progress, in, many, countries, in, africa, for, instance, in, namibia, the, marital, power, of, the, husband, was, abolished, in, 1996, by, the, married, persons, equality, act, in, botswana, it, was, abolished, in, 2004, by, the, abolition, of, marital, power, act, and, in, lesotho, it, was, abolished, in, 2006, by, the, married, persons, equality, act, violence, against, a, wife, continues, to, be, seen, as, legally, acceptable, in, some, countries, for, instance, in, 2010, the, united, arab, emirates, supreme, court, ruled, that, a, man, has, the, right, to, physically, discipline, his, wife, and, children, as, long, as, he, does, not, leave, physical, marks, the, criminalization, of, adultery, has, been, criticized, as, being, a, prohibition, which, in, law, or, in, practice, is, used, primarily, against, women, and, incites, violence, against, women, crimes, of, passion, honor, killings, two, recent, movements, in, countries, with, large, kurdish, populations, have, implemented, political, gender, equality, one, has, been, the, kurdish, movement, in, southeastern, turkey, led, by, the, democratic, regions, party, dbp, and, the, peoples, democratic, party, hdp, from, 2006, or, before, the, mayorships, of, 2, metropolitan, areas, and, 97, towns, are, led, jointly, by, a, man, and, a, woman, both, called, co, mayors, party, offices, are, also, led, by, a, man, and, a, woman, local, councils, were, formed, which, also, had, to, be, co, presided, over, by, a, man, and, a, woman, together, however, in, november, 2016, the, turkish, government, cracked, down, on, the, hdp, jailing, ten, of, its, members, of, parliament, including, the, party, s, male, and, female, co, leaders, a, movement, in, northern, syria, also, kurdish, has, been, led, by, the, democratic, union, party, pyd, in, northern, syria, all, villages, towns, and, cities, governed, by, the, pyd, were, co, governed, by, a, man, and, a, woman, local, councils, were, formed, where, each, sex, had, to, have, 40, representation, and, minorities, also, had, to, be, represented, gender, stereotypes, arise, from, the, socially, approved, roles, of, women, and, men, in, the, private, or, public, sphere, at, home, or, in, the, workplace, in, the, household, women, are, typically, seen, as, mother, figures, which, usually, places, them, into, a, typical, classification, of, being, supportive, or, nurturing, women, are, expected, to, want, to, take, on, the, role, of, a, mother, and, take, on, primary, responsibility, for, household, needs, their, male, counterparts, are, seen, as, being, assertive, or, ambitious, as, men, are, usually, seen, in, the, workplace, or, as, the, primary, breadwinner, for, his, family, due, to, these, views, and, expectations, women, often, face, discrimination, in, the, public, sphere, such, as, the, workplace, women, are, stereotyped, to, be, less, productive, at, work, because, they, are, believed, to, focus, more, on, family, when, they, get, married, or, have, children, a, gender, role, is, a, set, of, societal, norms, dictating, the, types, of, behaviors, which, are, generally, considered, acceptable, appropriate, or, desirable, for, people, based, on, their, sex, gender, roles, are, usually, centered, on, conceptions, of, femininity, and, masculinity, although, there, are, exceptions, and, variations, the, way, women, are, represented, in, the, media, has, been, criticized, as, perpetuating, negative, gender, stereotypes, the, exploitation, of, women, in, mass, media, refers, to, the, criticisms, that, are, levied, against, the, use, or, objectification, of, women, in, the, mass, media, when, such, use, or, portrayal, aims, at, increasing, the, appeal, of, media, or, a, product, to, the, detriment, of, or, without, regard, to, the, interests, of, the, women, portrayed, or, women, in, general, concerns, include, the, fact, that, all, forms, of, media, have, the, power, to, shape, the, population, s, perceptions, and, portray, images, of, unrealistic, stereotypical, perceptions, by, portraying, women, either, as, submissive, housewives, or, as, sex, objects, the, media, emphasizes, traditional, domestic, or, sexual, roles, that, normalize, violence, against, women, the, vast, array, of, studies, that, have, been, conducted, on, the, issue, of, the, portrayal, of, women, in, the, media, have, shown, that, women, are, often, portrayed, as, irrational, fragile, not, intelligent, submissive, and, subservient, to, men, research, has, shown, that, stereotyped, images, such, as, these, have, been, shown, to, negatively, impact, on, the, mental, health, of, many, female, viewers, who, feel, bound, by, these, roles, causing, amongst, other, problems, self, esteem, issues, depression, and, anxiety, according, to, a, study, the, way, women, are, often, portrayed, by, the, media, can, lead, to, women, of, average, or, normal, appearance, feeling, inadequate, or, less, beautiful, in, comparison, to, the, overwhelming, use, of, extraordinarily, attractive, women, increase, in, the, likelihood, and, acceptance, of, sexual, violence, unrealistic, expectations, by, men, of, how, women, should, look, or, behave, psychological, disorders, such, as, body, dysmorphic, disorder, anorexia, bulimia, and, so, on, the, importance, of, physical, appearance, is, emphasized, and, reinforced, early, in, most, girls, development, studies, have, found, that, nearly, half, of, females, ages, six, eight, have, stated, they, want, to, be, slimmer, striegel, moore, franko, 2002, while, in, many, countries, the, problem, lies, in, the, lack, of, adequate, legislation, in, others, the, principal, problem, is, not, as, much, the, lack, of, a, legal, framework, but, the, fact, that, most, women, do, not, know, their, legal, rights, this, is, especially, the, case, as, many, of, the, laws, dealing, with, women, s, rights, are, of, recent, date, this, lack, of, knowledge, enables, to, abusers, to, lead, the, victims, explicitly, or, implicitly, to, believe, that, their, abuse, is, within, their, rights, this, may, apply, to, a, wide, range, of, abuses, ranging, from, domestic, violence, to, employment, discrimination, the, united, nations, development, programme, states, that, in, order, to, advance, gender, justice, women, must, know, their, rights, and, be, able, to, access, legal, systems, the, 1993, un, declaration, on, the, elimination, of, violence, against, women, states, at, art, 4, d, states, should, also, inform, women, of, their, rights, in, seeking, redress, through, such, mechanisms, enacting, protective, legislation, against, violence, has, little, effect, if, women, do, not, know, how, to, use, it, for, example, a, study, of, bedouin, women, in, israel, found, that, 60, did, not, know, what, a, restraining, order, was, or, if, they, do, not, know, what, acts, are, illegal, a, report, by, amnesty, international, showed, in, hungary, in, a, public, opinion, poll, of, nearly, 1, 200, people, in, 2006, a, total, of, 62, did, not, know, that, marital, rape, was, an, illegal, it, was, outlawed, in, 1997, and, therefore, the, crime, was, rarely, reported, ensuring, women, have, a, minimum, understanding, of, health, issues, is, also, important, lack, of, access, to, reliable, medical, information, and, available, medical, procedures, to, which, they, are, entitled, hurts, women, s, health, gender, mainstreaming, is, described, as, the, public, policy, of, assessing, the, different, implications, for, women, and, men, of, any, planned, policy, action, including, legislation, and, programmes, in, all, areas, and, levels, with, the, aim, of, achieving, gender, equality, the, concept, of, gender, mainstreaming, was, first, proposed, at, the, 1985, third, world, conference, on, women, in, nairobi, kenya, the, idea, has, been, developed, in, the, united, nations, development, community, gender, mainstreaming, involves, ensuring, that, gender, perspectives, and, attention, to, the, goal, of, gender, equality, are, central, to, all, activities, according, to, the, council, of, europe, definition, gender, mainstreaming, is, the, re, organization, improvement, development, and, evaluation, of, policy, processes, so, that, a, gender, equality, perspective, is, incorporated, in, all, policies, at, all, levels, and, at, all, stages, by, the, actors, normally, involved, in, policy, making, an, integrated, gender, mainstreaming, approach, is, the, attempt, to, form, alliances, and, common, platforms, that, bring, together, the, power, of, faith, and, gender, equality, aspirations, to, advance, human, rights, for, example, in, azerbaijan, unfpa, conducted, a, study, on, gender, equality, by, comparing, the, text, of, the, convention, on, the, elimination, of, all, forms, of, discrimination, against, women, with, some, widely, recognized, islamic, references, and, resources, the, results, reflect, the, parallels, between, the, convention, and, many, tenets, of, islamic, scripture, and, practice, the, study, showcased, specific, issues, including, vaw, child, marriage, respect, for, the, dignity, of, women, and, equality, in, the, economic, and, political, participation, of, women, the, study, was, later, used, to, produce, training, materials, geared, towards, sensitizing, religious, leaders, this, article,
