the, presumption, of, innocence, is, a, legal, principle, that, every, person, accused, of, any, crime, is, considered, innocent, until, proven, guilty, under, the, presumption, of, innocence, the, legal, burden, of, proof, is, thus, on, the, prosecution, which, must, present, compelling, evidence, to, the, trier, of, fact, a, judge, or, a, jury, if, the, prosecution, does, not, prove, the, charges, true, then, the, person, is, acquitted, of, the, charges, the, prosecution, must, in, most, cases, prove, that, the, accused, is, guilty, beyond, a, reasonable, doubt, if, reasonable, doubt, remains, the, accused, must, be, acquitted, the, opposite, system, is, a, presumption, of, guilt, in, many, countries, and, under, many, legal, systems, including, common, law, and, civil, law, systems, not, to, be, confused, with, the, other, kind, of, civil, law, which, deals, with, non, criminal, legal, issues, the, presumption, of, innocence, is, a, legal, right, of, the, accused, in, a, criminal, trial, it, is, also, an, international, human, right, under, the, un, s, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, article, 11, the, sixth, century, digest, of, justinian, 22, 3, 2, provides, as, a, general, rule, of, evidence, ei, incumbit, probatio, qui, dicit, non, qui, negat, proof, lies, on, him, who, asserts, not, on, him, who, denies, it, is, there, attributed, to, the, second, and, third, century, jurist, julius, paulus, it, was, introduced, in, roman, criminal, law, by, emperor, antoninus, pius, a, civil, law, system, is, a, modern, legal, system, derived, from, the, ancient, roman, legal, system, as, opposed, to, the, english, common, law, system, the, maxim, and, its, equivalents, have, been, adopted, by, many, countries, that, use, a, civil, law, system, including, brazil, china, france, italy, philippines, poland, romania, and, spain, according, to, talmud, every, man, is, innocent, until, proved, guilty, hence, the, infliction, of, unusual, rigours, on, the, accused, must, be, delayed, until, his, innocence, has, been, successfully, challenged, thus, in, the, early, stages, of, the, trial, arguments, in, his, defence, are, as, elaborate, as, with, any, other, man, on, trial, only, when, his, guilt, has, become, apparent, were, the, solicitous, provisions, that, had, been, made, to, protect, defendants, waived, the, presumption, of, innocence, is, fundamental, to, islamic, law, where, the, principle, that, the, onus, of, proof, is, on, the, accuser, or, claimant, is, strongly, held, based, on, a, hadith, documented, by, imam, nawawi, suspicion, is, also, highly, condemned, this, also, from, a, hadith, documented, by, imam, nawawi, as, well, as, imam, bukhari, and, imam, muslim, after, the, time, of, muhammad, the, fourth, caliph, ali, ibn, abi, talib, has, also, been, cited, to, say, avert, the, prescribed, punishment, by, rejecting, doubtful, evidence, after, the, collapse, of, the, western, roman, empire, the, west, began, to, practice, feudal, law, which, was, a, synthesis, of, aspects, of, roman, law, as, well, as, some, germanic, customs, according, to, the, new, elite, including, presumed, guilt, for, instance, the, accused, could, prove, his, innocence, by, having, twelve, people, swear, that, he, could, not, have, done, what, he, was, accused, of, in, practice, this, tended, to, favor, the, nobility, over, the, lower, classes, whose, witnesses, risked, being, seen, as, less, credible, trials, by, ordeal, were, common, from, the, 6th, century, until, the, early, 13th, century, and, were, known, to, continue, into, the, 17th, century, in, the, form, of, witch, hunts, whilst, common, in, early, germanic, law, compurgation, was, formally, adopted, in, rome, by, pope, innocent, iii, in, 1215, at, the, fourth, lateran, council, and, trials, by, fire, and, water, specifically, were, forbidden, this, was, during, the, period, of, development, of, the, jus, commune, the, canon, law, of, the, catholic, church, influenced, the, common, law, during, the, medieval, period, in, the, early, 13th, century, louis, ix, of, france, banned, all, trials, by, ordeal, and, introduced, the, presumption, of, innocence, to, criminal, procedures, this, did, not, last, for, long, and, the, institutional, use, of, torture, called, question, pr, alable, and, subdivided, into, question, ordinaire, light, torture, and, question, extraordinaire, severe, torture, applied, at, the, judge, s, discretion, against, individuals, suspected, of, a, crime, was, to, last, up, to, the, eve, of, the, french, revolution, presumption, of, innocence, serves, to, emphasize, that, the, prosecution, has, the, obligation, to, prove, each, element, of, the, offense, beyond, a, reasonable, doubt, or, some, other, level, of, proof, depending, on, the, criminal, justice, system, and, that, the, accused, bears, no, burden, of, proof, this, is, often, expressed, in, the, phrase, presumed, innocent, until, proven, guilty, coined, by, the, british, barrister, sir, william, garrow, 1760, 1840, during, a, 1791, trial, at, the, old, bailey, garrow, insisted, that, accusers, be, robustly, tested, in, court, an, objective, observer, in, the, position, of, the, juror, must, reasonably, conclude, that, the, defendant, almost, certainly, committed, the, crime, in, 1935, in, its, judgment, of, woolmington, v, director, of, public, prosecutions, the, english, court, of, appeal, would, later, describe, this, concept, as, being, the, golden, thread, running, through, the, web, of, english, criminal, law, garrow, s, statement, was, the, first, formal, articulation, of, this, the, presumption, of, innocence, was, originally, expressed, by, the, french, cardinal, and, canonical, jurist, jean, lemoine, in, the, phrase, item, quilbet, presumitur, innocens, nisi, probetur, nocens, a, person, is, presumed, innocent, until, proven, guilty, based, on, the, legal, inference, that, most, people, are, not, criminals, this, referred, not, merely, to, the, fact, that, the, burden, of, proof, rests, on, the, prosecution, in, a, criminal, case, but, the, protections, which, a, defendant, should, be, given, prior, notice, of, the, accusation, being, made, against, them, the, right, of, confrontation, right, to, counsel, etc, it, is, literally, considered, favorable, evidence, for, the, accused, that, automatically, attaches, at, trial, it, requires, that, the, trier, of, fact, be, it, a, juror, or, judge, begin, with, the, presumption, that, the, state, is, unable, to, support, its, assertion, to, ensure, this, legal, protection, is, maintained, a, set, of, three, related, rules, govern, the, procedure, of, criminal, trials, the, presumption, means, blackstone, s, ratio, as, expressed, by, the, english, jurist, william, blackstone, in, his, seminal, work, commentaries, on, the, laws, of, england, published, in, the, 1760s, said, that, it, is, better, that, ten, guilty, persons, escape, than, that, one, innocent, suffer, the, idea, subsequently, became, a, staple, of, legal, thinking, in, anglo, saxon, jurisdictions, and, continues, to, be, a, topic, of, debate, this, duty, on, the, prosecution, was, famously, referred, to, as, the, golden, thread, in, the, criminal, law, by, lord, sankey, lc, in, woolmington, v, dpp, throughout, the, web, of, the, english, criminal, law, one, golden, thread, is, always, to, be, seen, that, it, is, the, duty, of, the, prosecution, to, prove, the, prisoner, s, guilt, subject, to, what, i, have, already, said, as, to, the, defence, of, insanity, and, subject, also, to, any, statutory, exception, this, right, is, considered, important, enough, in, modern, democracies, constitutional, monarchies, and, republics, that, many, have, explicitly, included, it, in, their, legal, codes, and, constitutions, in, the, united, kingdom, changes, have, been, made, affecting, this, principle, defendants, previous, convictions, may, in, certain, circumstances, be, revealed, to, juries, although, the, suspect, is, not, compelled, to, answer, questions, after, formal, arrest, failure, to, give, information, may, now, be, prejudicial, at, trial, statute, law, also, exists, which, provides, for, criminal, penalties, for, failing, to, decrypt, data, on, request, from, the, police, if, the, suspect, is, unwilling, to, do, so, it, is, an, offence, citizens, can, therefore, be, convicted, and, imprisoned, without, any, evidence, that, the, encrypted, material, was, unlawful, furthermore, in, sexual, offence, cases, such, as, rape, where, the, sexual, act, has, already, been, proved, beyond, reasonable, doubt, there, are, a, limited, number, of, circumstances, where, the, defendant, has, an, obligation, to, adduce, evidence, that, the, complainant, consented, to, the, sexual, act, or, that, the, defendant, reasonably, believed, that, the, complainant, was, consenting, these, circumstances, include, for, example, where, the, complainant, was, unconscious, unlawfully, detained, or, subjected, to, violence, in, canadian, law, the, presumption, of, innocence, has, been, reinforced, in, certain, instances, the, criminal, code, previously, contained, numerous, provisions, according, to, which, defences, to, certain, offences, were, subject, to, a, reverse, onus, that, is, if, an, accused, wishes, to, make, that, defence, they, had, to, prove, the, facts, of, the, defence, to, a, balance, of, probabilities, rather, than, the, crown, having, to, disprove, the, defence, beyond, a, reasonable, doubt, this, meant, that, an, accused, in, some, circumstances, might, be, convicted, even, if, a, reasonable, doubt, existed, about, their, guilt, in, several, cases, various, reverse, onus, provisions, were, found, to, violate, the, presumption, of, innocence, provision, of, the, canadian, charter, of, rights, and, freedoms, they, were, replaced, with, procedures, in, which, the, accused, merely, had, to, demonstrate, an, air, of, reality, to, the, proposed, defence, following, which, the, burden, shifted, to, the, crown, to, disprove, the, defence, bill, c, 51, an, act, to, amend, the, criminal, code, and, the, department, of, justice, act, and, to, make, consequential, amendments, to, another, act, received, royal, assent, in, december, 2018, among, other, things, it, eliminated, several, reverse, onus, provisions, from, the, criminal, code, some, of, which, had, previously, been, found, unconstitutional, and, others, pre, emptively, in, order, to, avoid, further, charter, challenges
