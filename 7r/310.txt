linguistics, is, the, scientific, study, of, language, linguistics, is, based, on, a, theoretical, as, well, as, a, descriptive, study, of, language, and, is, also, interlinked, with, the, applied, fields, of, language, studies, and, language, learning, which, entails, the, study, of, specific, languages, before, the, 20th, century, linguistics, evolved, in, conjunction, with, literary, study, and, did, not, employ, scientific, methods, modern, day, linguistics, is, considered, a, science, because, it, entails, a, comprehensive, systematic, objective, and, precise, analysis, of, all, aspects, of, language, i, e, the, cognitive, the, social, the, cultural, the, psychological, the, environmental, the, biological, the, literary, the, grammatical, the, paleographical, and, the, structural, traditional, areas, of, linguistic, analysis, correspond, to, syntax, rules, governing, the, structure, of, sentences, semantics, meaning, morphology, structure, of, words, phonetics, speech, sounds, and, equivalent, gestures, in, sign, languages, phonology, the, abstract, sound, system, of, a, particular, language, and, pragmatics, how, social, context, contributes, to, meaning, subdisciplines, such, as, biolinguistics, the, study, of, the, biological, variables, and, evolution, of, language, and, psycholinguistics, the, study, of, psychological, factors, in, human, language, bridge, many, of, these, divisions, linguistics, encompasses, many, branches, and, subfields, that, span, both, theoretical, and, practical, applications, theoretical, linguistics, including, traditional, descriptive, linguistics, is, concerned, with, understanding, the, universal, and, fundamental, nature, of, language, and, developing, a, general, theoretical, framework, for, describing, it, applied, linguistics, seeks, to, utilize, the, scientific, findings, of, the, study, of, language, for, practical, purposes, such, as, developing, methods, of, improving, language, education, and, literacy, linguistic, features, may, be, studied, through, a, variety, of, perspectives, synchronically, by, describing, the, structure, of, a, language, at, a, specific, point, in, time, or, diachronically, through, the, historical, development, of, a, language, over, a, period, of, time, in, monolinguals, or, in, multilinguals, among, children, or, amongst, adults, in, terms, of, how, it, is, being, learnt, or, how, it, was, acquired, as, abstract, objects, or, as, cognitive, structures, through, written, texts, or, through, oral, elicitation, and, finally, through, mechanical, data, collection, or, through, practical, fieldwork, linguistics, emerged, from, the, field, of, philology, of, which, some, branches, are, more, qualitative, and, holistic, in, approach, today, philology, and, linguistics, are, now, variably, described, as, related, fields, subdisciplines, or, separate, fields, of, language, study, but, by, and, large, linguistics, can, be, seen, as, an, umbrella, term, linguistics, is, also, related, to, the, philosophy, of, language, stylistics, rhetoric, semiotics, lexicography, and, translation, historical, linguistics, is, the, study, of, how, language, changes, over, history, particularly, with, regard, to, a, specific, language, or, a, group, of, languages, western, trends, in, historical, linguistics, date, back, to, roughly, the, late, 18th, century, when, the, discipline, grew, out, of, philology, the, study, of, ancient, texts, and, oral, traditions, historical, linguistics, emerged, as, one, of, the, first, few, sub, disciplines, in, the, field, and, was, most, widely, practised, during, the, late, 19th, century, despite, a, shift, in, focus, in, the, 20th, century, towards, formalism, and, generative, grammar, which, studies, the, universal, properties, of, language, historical, research, today, still, remains, a, significant, field, of, linguistic, inquiry, subfields, of, the, discipline, include, language, change, and, grammaticalization, historical, linguistics, studies, language, change, either, diachronically, through, a, comparison, of, different, time, periods, in, the, past, and, present, or, in, a, synchronic, manner, by, observing, developments, between, different, variations, that, exist, within, the, current, linguistic, stage, of, a, language, at, first, historical, linguistics, was, the, cornerstone, of, comparative, linguistics, which, involves, a, study, of, the, relationship, between, different, languages, at, that, time, scholars, of, historical, linguistics, were, only, concerned, with, creating, different, categories, of, language, families, and, reconstructing, prehistoric, proto, languages, by, using, both, the, comparative, method, and, the, method, of, internal, reconstruction, internal, reconstruction, is, the, method, by, which, an, element, that, contains, a, certain, meaning, is, re, used, in, different, contexts, or, environments, where, there, is, a, variation, in, either, sound, or, analogy, the, reason, for, this, had, been, to, describe, well, known, indo, european, languages, many, of, which, had, detailed, documentation, and, long, written, histories, scholars, of, historical, linguistics, also, studied, uralic, languages, another, european, language, family, for, which, very, little, written, material, existed, back, then, after, that, there, also, followed, significant, work, on, the, corpora, of, other, languages, such, as, the, austronesian, languages, and, the, native, american, language, families, in, historical, work, the, uniformitarian, principle, is, generally, the, underlying, working, hypothesis, occasionally, also, clearly, expressed, the, principle, was, expressed, early, by, william, dwight, whitney, who, considered, it, imperative, a, must, of, historical, linguistics, to, look, to, find, the, same, principle, operative, also, in, the, very, outset, of, that, history, the, above, approach, of, comparativism, in, linguistics, is, now, however, only, a, small, part, of, the, much, broader, discipline, called, historical, linguistics, the, comparative, study, of, specific, indo, european, languages, is, considered, a, highly, specialized, field, today, while, comparative, research, is, carried, out, over, the, subsequent, internal, developments, in, a, language, in, particular, over, the, development, of, modern, standard, varieties, of, languages, and, over, the, development, of, a, language, from, its, standardized, form, to, its, varieties, for, instance, some, scholars, also, tried, to, establish, super, families, linking, for, example, indo, european, uralic, and, other, language, families, to, nostratic, while, these, attempts, are, still, not, widely, accepted, as, credible, methods, they, provide, necessary, information, to, establish, relatedness, in, language, change, this, is, generally, hard, to, find, for, events, long, ago, due, to, the, occurrence, of, chance, word, resemblances, and, variations, between, language, groups, a, limit, of, around, 10, 000, years, is, often, assumed, for, the, functional, purpose, of, conducting, research, it, is, also, hard, to, date, various, proto, languages, even, though, several, methods, are, available, these, languages, can, be, dated, only, approximately, in, modern, historical, linguistics, we, examine, how, languages, change, over, time, focusing, on, the, relationships, between, dialects, within, a, specific, period, this, includes, studying, morphological, syntactical, and, phonetic, shifts, connections, between, dialects, in, the, past, and, present, are, also, explored, syntax, is, the, study, of, how, words, and, morphemes, combine, to, form, larger, units, such, as, phrases, and, sentences, central, concerns, of, syntax, include, word, order, grammatical, relations, constituency, agreement, the, nature, of, crosslinguistic, variation, and, the, relationship, between, form, and, meaning, there, are, numerous, approaches, to, syntax, that, differ, in, their, central, assumptions, and, goals, morphology, is, the, study, of, words, including, the, principles, by, which, they, are, formed, and, how, they, relate, to, one, another, within, a, language, most, approaches, to, morphology, investigate, the, structure, of, words, in, terms, of, morphemes, which, are, the, smallest, units, in, a, language, with, some, independent, meaning, morphemes, include, roots, that, can, exist, as, words, by, themselves, but, also, categories, such, as, affixes, that, can, only, appear, as, part, of, a, larger, word, for, example, in, english, the, root, catch, and, the, suffix, ing, are, both, morphemes, catch, may, appear, as, its, own, word, or, it, may, be, combined, with, ing, to, form, the, new, word, catching, morphology, also, analyzes, how, words, behave, as, parts, of, speech, and, how, they, may, be, inflected, to, express, grammatical, categories, including, number, tense, and, aspect, concepts, such, as, productivity, are, concerned, with, how, speakers, create, words, in, specific, contexts, which, evolves, over, the, history, of, a, language, the, discipline, that, deals, specifically, with, the, sound, changes, occurring, within, morphemes, is, morphophonology, semantics, and, pragmatics, are, branches, of, linguistics, concerned, with, meaning, these, subfields, have, traditionally, been, divided, according, to, aspects, of, meaning, semantics, refers, to, grammatical, and, lexical, meanings, while, pragmatics, is, concerned, with, meaning, in, context, within, linguistics, the, subfield, of, formal, semantics, studies, the, denotations, of, sentences, and, how, they, are, composed, from, the, meanings, of, their, constituent, expressions, formal, semantics, draws, heavily, on, philosophy, of, language, and, uses, formal, tools, from, logic, and, computer, science, on, the, other, hand, cognitive, semantics, explains, linguistic, meaning, via, aspects, of, general, cognition, drawing, on, ideas, from, cognitive, science, such, as, prototype, theory, pragmatics, focuses, on, phenomena, such, as, speech, acts, implicature, and, talk, in, interaction, unlike, semantics, which, examines, meaning, that, is, conventional, or, coded, in, a, given, language, pragmatics, studies, how, the, transmission, of, meaning, depends, not, only, on, the, structural, and, linguistic, knowledge, grammar, lexicon, etc, of, the, speaker, and, listener, but, also, on, the, context, of, the, utterance, any, pre, existing, knowledge, about, those, involved, the, inferred, intent, of, the, speaker, and, other, factors, phonetics, and, phonology, are, branches, of, linguistics, concerned, with, sounds, or, the, equivalent, aspects, of, sign, languages, phonetics, is, largely, concerned, with, the, physical, aspects, of, sounds, such, as, their, articulation, acoustics, production, and, perception, phonology, is, concerned, with, the, linguistic, abstractions, and, categorizations, of, sounds, and, it, tells, us, what, sounds, are, in, a, language, how, they, do, and, can, combine, into, words, and, explains, why, certain, phonetic, features, are, important, to, identifying, a, word, linguistic, structures, are, pairings, of, meaning, and, form, any, particular, pairing, of, meaning, and, form, is, a, saussurean, linguistic, sign, for, instance, the, meaning, cat, is, represented, worldwide, with, a, wide, variety, of, different, sound, patterns, in, oral, languages, movements, of, the, hands, and, face, in, sign, languages, and, written, symbols, in, written, languages, linguistic, patterns, have, proven, their, importance, for, the, knowledge, engineering, field, especially, with, the, ever, increasing, amount, of, available, data, linguists, focusing, on, structure, attempt, to, understand, the, rules, regarding, language, use, that, native, speakers, know, not, always, consciously, all, linguistic, structures, can, be, broken, down, into, component, parts, that, are, combined, according, to, sub, conscious, rules, over, multiple, levels, of, analysis, for, instance, consider, the, structure, of, the, word, tenth, on, two, different, levels, of, analysis, on, the, level, of, internal, word, structure, known, as, morphology, the, word, tenth, is, made, up, of, one, linguistic, form, indicating, a, number, and, another, form, indicating, ordinality, the, rule, governing, the, combination, of, these, forms, ensures, that, the, ordinality, marker, th, follows, the, number, ten, on, the, level, of, sound, structure, known, as, phonology, structural, analysis, shows, that, the, n, sound, in, tenth, is, made, differently, from, the, n, sound, in, ten, spoken, alone, although, most, speakers, of, english, are, consciously, aware, of, the, rules, governing, internal, structure, of, the, word, pieces, of, tenth, they, are, less, often, aware, of, the, rule, governing, its, sound, structure, linguists, focused, on, structure, find, and, analyze, rules, such, as, these, which, govern, how, native, speakers, use, language, grammar, is, a, system, of, rules, which, governs, the, production, and, use, of, utterances, in, a, given, language, these, rules, apply, to, sound, as, well, as, meaning, and, include, componential, subsets, of, rules, such, as, those, pertaining, to, phonology, the, organization, of, phonetic, sound, systems, morphology, the, formation, and, composition, of, words, and, syntax, the, formation, and, composition, of, phrases, and, sentences, modern, frameworks, that, deal, with, the, principles, of, grammar, include, structural, and, functional, linguistics, and, generative, linguistics, sub, fields, that, focus, on, a, grammatical, study, of, language, include, the, following, discourse, is, language, as, social, practice, baynham, 1995, and, is, a, multilayered, concept, as, a, social, practice, discourse, embodies, different, ideologies, through, written, and, spoken, texts, discourse, analysis, can, examine, or, expose, these, ideologies, discourse, not, only, influences, genre, which, is, selected, based, on, specific, contexts, but, also, at, a, micro, level, shapes, language, as, text, spoken, or, written, down, to, the, phonological, and, lexico, grammatical, levels, grammar, and, discourse, are, linked, as, parts, of, a, system, a, particular, discourse, becomes, a, language, variety, when, it, is, used, in, this, way, for, a, particular, purpose, and, is, referred, to, as, a, register, there, may, be, certain, lexical, additions, new, words, that, are, brought, into, play, because, of, the, expertise, of, the, community, of, people, within, a, certain, domain, of, specialization, thus, registers, and, discourses, distinguish, themselves, not, only, through, specialized, vocabulary, but, also, in, some, cases, through, distinct, stylistic, choices, people, in, the, medical, fraternity, for, example, may, use, some, medical, terminology, in, their, communication, that, is, specialized, to, the, field, of, medicine, this, is, often, referred, to, as, being, part, of, the, medical, discourse, and, so, on, the, lexicon, is, a, catalogue, of, words, and, terms, that, are, stored, in, a, speaker, s, mind, the, lexicon, consists, of, words, and, bound, morphemes, which, are, parts, of, words, that, can, not, stand, alone, like, affixes, in, some, analyses, compound, words, and, certain, classes, of, idiomatic, expressions, and, other, collocations, are, also, considered, to, be, part, of, the, lexicon, dictionaries, represent, attempts, at, listing, in, alphabetical, order, the, lexicon, of, a, given, language, usually, however, bound, morphemes, are, not, included, lexicography, closely, linked, with, the, domain, of, semantics, is, the, science, of, mapping, the, words, into, an, encyclopedia, or, a, dictionary, the, creation, and, addition, of, new, words, into, the, lexicon, is, called, coining, or, neologization, and, the, new, words, are, called, neologisms, it, is, often, believed, that, a, speaker, s, capacity, for, language, lies, in, the, quantity, of, words, stored, in, the, lexicon, however, this, is, often, considered, a, myth, by, linguists, the, capacity, for, the, use, of, language, is, considered, by, many, linguists, to, lie, primarily, in, the, domain, of, grammar, and, to, be, linked, with, competence, rather, than, with, the, growth, of, vocabulary, even, a, very, small, lexicon, is, theoretically, capable, of, producing, an, infinite, number, of, sentences, stylistics, also, involves, the, study, of, written, signed, or, spoken, discourse, through, varying, speech, communities, genres, and, editorial, or, narrative, formats, in, the, mass, media, it, involves, the, study, and, interpretation, of, texts, for, aspects, of, their, linguistic, and, tonal, style, stylistic, analysis, entails, the, analysis, of, description, of, particular, dialects, and, registers, used, by, speech, communities, stylistic, features, include, rhetoric, diction, stress, satire, irony, dialogue, and, other, forms, of, phonetic, variations, stylistic, analysis, can, also, include, the, study, of, language, in, canonical, works, of, literature, popular, fiction, news, advertisements, and, other, forms, of, communication, in, popular, culture, as, well, it, is, usually, seen, as, a, variation, in, communication, that, changes, from, speaker, to, speaker, and, community, to, community, in, short, stylistics, is, the, interpretation, of, text, in, the, 1960s, jacques, derrida, for, instance, further, distinguished, between, speech, and, writing, by, proposing, that, written, language, be, studied, as, a, linguistic, medium, of, communication, in, itself, palaeography, is, therefore, the, discipline, that, studies, the, evolution, of, written, scripts, as, signs, and, symbols, in, language, the, formal, study, of, language, also, led, to, the, growth, of, fields, like, psycholinguistics, which, explores, the, representation, and, function, of, language, in, the, mind, neurolinguistics, which, studies, language, processing, in, the, brain, biolinguistics, which, studies, the, biology, and, evolution, of, language, and, language, acquisition, which, investigates, how, children, and, adults, acquire, the, knowledge, of, one, or, more, languages, the, fundamental, principle, of, humanistic, linguistics, especially, rational, and, logical, grammar, is, that, language, is, an, invention, created, by, people, a, semiotic, tradition, of, linguistic, research, considers, language, a, sign, system, which, arises, from, the, interaction, of, meaning, and, form, the, organization, of, linguistic, levels, is, considered, computational, linguistics, is, essentially, seen, as, relating, to, social, and, cultural, studies, because, different, languages, are, shaped, in, social, interaction, by, the, speech, community, frameworks, representing, the, humanistic, view, of, language, include, structural, linguistics, among, others, structural, analysis, means, dissecting, each, linguistic, level, phonetic, morphological, syntactic, and, discourse, to, the, smallest, units, these, are, collected, into, inventories, e, g, phoneme, morpheme, lexical, classes, phrase, types, to, study, their, interconnectedness, within, a, hierarchy, of, structures, and, layers, functional, analysis, adds, to, structural, analysis, the, assignment, of, semantic, and, other, functional, roles, that, each, unit, may, have, for, example, a, noun, phrase, may, function, as, the, subject, or, object, of, the, sentence, or, the, agent, or, patient, functional, linguistics, or, functional, grammar, is, a, branch, of, structural, linguistics, in, the, humanistic, reference, the, terms, structuralism, and, functionalism, are, related, to, their, meaning, in, other, human, sciences, the, difference, between, formal, and, functional, structuralism, lies, in, the, way, that, the, two, approaches, explain, why, languages, have, the, properties, they, have, functional, explanation, entails, the, idea, that, language, is, a, tool, for, communication, or, that, communication, is, the, primary, function, of, language, linguistic, forms, are, consequently, explained, by, an, appeal, to, their, functional, value, or, usefulness, other, structuralist, approaches, take, the, perspective, that, form, follows, from, the, inner, mechanisms, of, the, bilateral, and, multilayered, language, system, approaches, such, as, cognitive, linguistics, and, generative, grammar, study, linguistic, cognition, with, a, view, towards, uncovering, the, biological, underpinnings, of, language, in, generative, grammar, these, underpinning, are, understood, as, including, innate, domain, specific, grammatical, knowledge, thus, one, of, the, central, concerns, of, the, approach, is, to, discover, what, aspects, of, linguistic, knowledge, are, innate, and, which, are, not, cognitive, linguistics, in, contrast, rejects, the, notion, of, innate, grammar, and, studies, how, the, human, mind, creates, linguistic, constructions, from, event, schemas, and, the, impact, of, cognitive, constraints, and, biases, on, human, language, in, cognitive, linguistics, language, is, approached, via, the, senses, a, closely, related, approach, is, evolutionary, linguistics, which, includes, the, study, of, linguistic, units, as, cultural, replicators, it, is, possible, to, study, how, language, replicates, and, adapts, to, the, mind, of, the, individual, or, the, speech, community, construction, grammar, is, a, framework, which, applies, the, meme, concept, to, the, study, of, syntax, the, generative, versus, evolutionary, approach, are, sometimes, called, formalism, and, functionalism, respectively, this, reference, is, however, different, from, the, use, of, the, terms, in, human, sciences, modern, linguistics, is, primarily, descriptive, linguists, describe, and, explain, features, of, language, without, making, subjective, judgments, on, whether, a, particular, feature, or, usage, is, good, or, bad, this, is, analogous, to, practice, in, other, sciences, a, zoologist, studies, the, animal, kingdom, without, making, subjective, judgments, on, whether, a, particular, species, is, better, or, worse, than, another, prescription, on, the, other, hand, is, an, attempt, to, promote, particular, linguistic, usages, over, others, often, favoring, a, particular, dialect, or, acrolect, this, may, have, the, aim, of, establishing, a, linguistic, standard, which, can, aid, communication, over, large, geographical, areas, it, may, also, however, be, an, attempt, by, speakers, of, one, language, or, dialect, to, exert, influence, over, speakers, of, other, languages, or, dialects, see, linguistic, imperialism, an, extreme, version, of, prescriptivism, can, be, found, among, censors, who, attempt, to, eradicate, words, and, structures, that, they, consider, to, be, destructive, to, society, prescription, however, may, be, practised, appropriately, in, language, instruction, like, in, elt, where, certain, fundamental, grammatical, rules, and, lexical, items, need, to, be, introduced, to, a, second, language, speaker, who, is, attempting, to, acquire, the, language, most, contemporary, linguists, work, under, the, assumption, that, spoken, data, and, signed, data, are, more, fundamental, than, written, data, this, is, because, nonetheless, linguists, agree, that, the, study, of, written, language, can, be, worthwhile, and, valuable, for, research, that, relies, on, corpus, linguistics, and, computational, linguistics, written, language, is, often, much, more, convenient, for, processing, large, amounts, of, linguistic, data, large, corpora, of, spoken, language, are, difficult, to, create, and, hard, to, find, and, are, typically, transcribed, and, written, in, addition, linguists, have, turned, to, text, based, discourse, occurring, in, various, formats, of, computer, mediated, communication, as, a, viable, site, for, linguistic, inquiry, the, study, of, writing, systems, themselves, graphemics, is, in, any, case, considered, a, branch, of, linguistics, before, the, 20th, century, linguists, analysed, language, on, a, diachronic, plane, which, was, historical, in, focus, this, meant, that, they, would, compare, linguistic, features, and, try, to, analyse, language, from, the, point, of, view, of, how, it, had, changed, between, then, and, later, however, with, the, rise, of, saussurean, linguistics, in, the, 20th, century, the, focus, shifted, to, a, more, synchronic, approach, where, the, study, was, geared, towards, analysis, and, comparison, between, different, language, variations, which, existed, at, the, same, given, point, of, time, at, another, level, the, syntagmatic, plane, of, linguistic, analysis, entails, the, comparison, between, the, way, words, are, sequenced, within, the, syntax, of, a, sentence, for, example, the, article, the, is, followed, by, a, noun, because, of, the, syntagmatic, relation, between, the, words, the, paradigmatic, plane, on, the, other, hand, focuses, on, an, analysis, that, is, based, on, the, paradigms, or, concepts, that, are, embedded, in, a, given, text, in, this, case, words, of, the, same, type, or, class, may, be, replaced, in, the, text, with, each, other, to, achieve, the, same, conceptual, understanding, the, earliest, activities, in, the, description, of, language, have, been, attributed, to, the, 6th, century, bc, indian, grammarian, p, ini, who, wrote, a, formal, description, of, the, sanskrit, language, in, his, a, dhy, y, today, modern, day, theories, on, grammar, employ, many, of, the, principles, that, were, laid, down, then, before, the, 20th, century, the, term, philology, first, attested, in, 1716, was, commonly, used, to, refer, to, the, study, of, language, which, was, then, predominantly, historical, in, focus, since, ferdinand, de, saussure, s, insistence, on, the, importance, of, synchronic, analysis, however, this, focus, has, shifted, and, the, term, philology, is, now, generally, used, for, the, study, of, a, language, s, grammar, history, and, literary, tradition, especially, in, the, united, states, where, philology, has, never, been, very, popularly, considered, as, the, science, of, language, although, the, term, linguist, in, the, sense, of, a, student, of, language, dates, from, 1641, the, term, linguistics, is, first, attested, in, 1847, it, is, now, the, usual, term, in, english, for, the, scientific, study, of, language, though, linguistic, science, is, sometimes, used, linguistics, is, a, multi, disciplinary, field, of, research, that, combines, tools, from, natural, sciences, social, sciences, formal, sciences, and, the, humanities, many, linguists, such, as, david, crystal, conceptualize, the, field, as, being, primarily, scientific, the, term, linguist, applies, to, someone, who, studies, language, or, is, a, researcher, within, the, field, or, to, someone, who, uses, the, tools, of, the, discipline, to, describe, and, analyse, specific, languages, an, early, formal, study, of, language, was, in, india, with, p, ini, the, 6th, century, bc, grammarian, who, formulated, 3, 959, rules, of, sanskrit, morphology, p, ini, s, systematic, classification, of, the, sounds, of, sanskrit, into, consonants, and, vowels, and, word, classes, such, as, nouns, and, verbs, was, the, first, known, instance, of, its, kind, in, the, middle, east, sibawayh, a, persian, made, a, detailed, description, of, arabic, in, ad, 760, in, his, monumental, work, al, kitab, fii, an, na, w, the, book, on, grammar, the, first, known, author, to, distinguish, between, sounds, and, phonemes, sounds, as, units, of, a, linguistic, system, western, interest, in, the, study, of, languages, began, somewhat, later, than, in, the, east, but, the, grammarians, of, the, classical, languages, did, not, use, the, same, methods, or, reach, the, same, conclusions, as, their, contemporaries, in, the, indic, world, early, interest, in, language, in, the, west, was, a, part, of, philosophy, not, of, grammatical, description, the, first, insights, into, semantic, theory, were, made, by, plato, in, his, cratylus, dialogue, where, he, argues, that, words, denote, concepts, that, are, eternal, and, exist, in, the, world, of, ideas, this, work, is, the, first, to, use, the, word, etymology, to, describe, the, history, of, a, word, s, meaning, around, 280, bc, one, of, alexander, the, great, s, successors, founded, a, university, see, musaeum, in, alexandria, where, a, school, of, philologists, studied, the, ancient, texts, in, greek, and, taught, greek, to, speakers, of, other, languages, while, this, school, was, the, first, to, use, the, word, grammar, in, its, modern, sense, plato, had, used, the, word, in, its, original, meaning, as, t, chn, grammatik, the, art, of, writing, which, is, also, the, title, of, one, of, the, most, important, works, of, the, alexandrine, school, by, dionysius, thrax, throughout, the, middle, ages, the, study, of, language, was, subsumed, under, the, topic, of, philology, the, study, of, ancient, languages, and, texts, practised, by, such, educators, as, roger, ascham, wolfgang, ratke, and, john, amos, comenius, in, the, 18th, century, the, first, use, of, the, comparative, method, by, william, jones, sparked, the, rise, of, comparative, linguistics, bloomfield, attributes, the, first, great, scientific, linguistic, work, of, the, world, to, jacob, grimm, who, wrote, deutsche, grammatik, it, was, soon, followed, by, other, authors, writing, similar, comparative, studies, on, other, language, groups, of, europe, the, study, of, language, was, broadened, from, indo, european, to, language, in, general, by, wilhelm, von, humboldt, of, whom, bloomfield, asserts, this, study, received, its, foundation, at, the, hands, of, the, prussian, statesman, and, scholar, wilhelm, von, humboldt, 1767, 1835, especially, in, the, first, volume, of, his, work, on, kavi, the, literary, language, of, java, entitled, ber, die, verschiedenheit, des, menschlichen, sprachbaues, und, ihren, einflu, auf, die, geistige, entwickelung, des, menschengeschlechts, on, the, variety, of, the, structure, of, human, language, and, its, influence, upon, the, mental, development, of, the, human, race, there, was, a, shift, of, focus, from, historical, and, comparative, linguistics, to, synchronic, analysis, in, early, 20th, century, structural, analysis, was, improved, by, leonard, bloomfield, louis, hjelmslev, and, zellig, harris, who, also, developed, methods, of, discourse, analysis, functional, analysis, was, developed, by, the, prague, linguistic, circle, and, andr, martinet, as, sound, recording, devices, became, commonplace, in, the, 1960s, dialectal, recordings, were, made, and, archived, and, the, audio, lingual, method, provided, a, technological, solution, to, foreign, language, learning, the, 1960s, also, saw, a, new, rise, of, comparative, linguistics, the, study, of, language, universals, in, linguistic, typology, towards, the, end, of, the, century, the, field, of, linguistics, became, divided, into, further, areas, of, interest, with, the, advent, of, language, technology, and, digitalized, corpora, sociolinguistics, is, the, study, of, how, language, is, shaped, by, social, factors, this, sub, discipline, focuses, on, the, synchronic, approach, of, linguistics, and, looks, at, how, a, language, in, general, or, a, set, of, languages, display, variation, and, varieties, at, a, given, point, in, time, the, study, of, language, variation, and, the, different, varieties, of, language, through, dialects, registers, and, idiolects, can, be, tackled, through, a, study, of, style, as, well, as, through, analysis, of, discourse, sociolinguists, research, both, style, and, discourse, in, language, as, well, as, the, theoretical, factors, that, are, at, play, between, language, and, society, developmental, linguistics, is, the, study, of, the, development, of, linguistic, ability, in, individuals, particularly, the, acquisition, of, language, in, childhood, some, of, the, questions, that, developmental, linguistics, looks, into, are, how, children, acquire, different, languages, how, adults, can, acquire, a, second, language, and, what, the, process, of, language, acquisition, is, neurolinguistics, is, the, study, of, the, structures, in, the, human, brain, that, underlie, grammar, and, communication, researchers, are, drawn, to, the, field, from, a, variety, of, backgrounds, bringing, along, a, variety, of, experimental, techniques, as, well, as, widely, varying, theoretical, perspectives, much, work, in, neurolinguistics, is, informed, by, models, in, psycholinguistics, and, theoretical, linguistics, and, is, focused, on, investigating, how, the, brain, can, implement, the, processes, that, theoretical, and, psycholinguistics, propose, are, necessary, in, producing, and, comprehending, language, neurolinguists, study, the, physiological, mechanisms, by, which, the, brain, processes, information, related, to, language, and, evaluate, linguistic, and, psycholinguistic, theories, using, aphasiology, brain, imaging, electrophysiology, and, computer, modelling, amongst, the, structures, of, the, brain, involved, in, the, mechanisms, of, neurolinguistics, the, cerebellum, which, contains, the, highest, numbers, of, neurons, has, a, major, role, in, terms, of, predictions, required, to, produce, language, linguists, are, largely, concerned, with, finding, and, describing, the, generalities, and, varieties, both, within, particular, languages, and, among, all, languages, applied, linguistics, takes, the, results, of, those, findings, and, applies, them, to, other, areas, linguistic, research, is, commonly, applied, to, areas, such, as, language, education, lexicography, translation, language, planning, which, involves, governmental, policy, implementation, related, to, language, use, and, natural, language, processing, applied, linguistics, has, been, argued, to, be, something, of, a, misnomer, applied, linguists, actually, focus, on, making, sense, of, and, engineering, solutions, for, real, world, linguistic, problems, and, not, literally, applying, existing, technical, knowledge, from, linguistics, moreover, they, commonly, apply, technical, knowledge, from, multiple, sources, such, as, sociology, e, g, conversation, analysis, and, anthropology, constructed, language, fits, under, applied, linguistics, today, computers, are, widely, used, in, many, areas, of, applied, linguistics, speech, synthesis, and, speech, recognition, use, phonetic, and, phonemic, knowledge, to, provide, voice, interfaces, to, computers, applications, of, computational, linguistics, in, machine, translation, computer, assisted, translation, and, natural, language, processing, are, areas, of, applied, linguistics, that, have, come, to, the, forefront, their, influence, has, had, an, effect, on, theories, of, syntax, and, semantics, as, modelling, syntactic, and, semantic, theories, on, computers, constraints, linguistic, analysis, is, a, sub, discipline, of, applied, linguistics, used, by, many, governments, to, verify, the, claimed, nationality, of, people, seeking, asylum, who, do, not, hold, the, necessary, documentation, to, prove, their, claim, this, often, takes, the, form, of, an, interview, by, personnel, in, an, immigration, department, depending, on, the, country, this, interview, is, conducted, either, in, the, asylum, seeker, s, native, language, through, an, interpreter, or, in, an, international, lingua, franca, like, english, australia, uses, the, former, method, while, germany, employs, the, latter, the, netherlands, uses, either, method, depending, on, the, languages, involved, tape, recordings, of, the, interview, then, undergo, language, analysis, which, can, be, done, either, by, private, contractors, or, within, a, department, of, the, government, in, this, analysis, linguistic, features, of, the, asylum, seeker, are, used, by, analysts, to, make, a, determination, about, the, speaker, s, nationality, the, reported, findings, of, the, linguistic, analysis, can, play, a, critical, role, in, the, government, s, decision, on, the, refugee, status, of, the, asylum, seeker, language, documentation, combines, anthropological, inquiry, into, the, history, and, culture, of, language, with, linguistic, inquiry, in, order, to, describe, languages, and, their, grammars, lexicography, involves, the, documentation, of, words, that, form, a, vocabulary, such, a, documentation, of, a, linguistic, vocabulary, from, a, particular, language, is, usually, compiled, in, a, dictionary, computational, linguistics, is, concerned, with, the, statistical, or, rule, based, modeling, of, natural, language, from, a, computational, perspective, specific, knowledge, of, language, is, applied, by, speakers, during, the, act, of, translation, and, interpretation, as, well, as, in, language, education, the, teaching, of, a, second, or, foreign, language, policy, makers, work, with, governments, to, implement, new, plans, in, education, and, teaching, which, are, based, on, linguistic, research, since, the, inception, of, the, discipline, of, linguistics, linguists, have, been, concerned, with, describing, and, analysing, previously, undocumented, languages, starting, with, franz, boas, in, the, early, 1900s, this, became, the, main, focus, of, american, linguistics, until, the, rise, of, formal, linguistics, in, the, mid, 20th, century, this, focus, on, language, documentation, was, partly, motivated, by, a, concern, to, document, the, rapidly, disappearing, languages, of, indigenous, peoples, the, ethnographic, dimension, of, the, boasian, approach, to, language, description, played, a, role, in, the, development, of, disciplines, such, as, sociolinguistics, anthropological, linguistics, and, linguistic, anthropology, which, investigate, the, relations, between, language, culture, and, society, the, emphasis, on, linguistic, description, and, documentation, has, also, gained, prominence, outside, north, america, with, the, documentation, of, rapidly, dying, indigenous, languages, becoming, a, focus, in, some, university, programs, in, linguistics, language, description, is, a, work, intensive, endeavour, usually, requiring, years, of, field, work, in, the, language, concerned, so, as, to, equip, the, linguist, to, write, a, sufficiently, accurate, reference, grammar, further, the, task, of, documentation, requires, the, linguist, to, collect, a, substantial, corpus, in, the, language, in, question, consisting, of, texts, and, recordings, both, sound, and, video, which, can, be, stored, in, an, accessible, format, within, open, repositories, and, used, for, further, research, the, sub, field, of, translation, includes, the, translation, of, written, and, spoken, texts, across, media, from, digital, to, print, and, spoken, to, translate, literally, means, to, transmute, the, meaning, from, one, language, into, another, translators, are, often, employed, by, organizations, such, as, travel, agencies, and, governmental, embassies, to, facilitate, communication, between, two, speakers, who, do, not, know, each, other, s, language, translators, are, also, employed, to, work, within, computational, linguistics, setups, like, google, translate, which, is, an, automated, program, to, translate, words, and, phrases, between, any, two, or, more, given, languages, translation, is, also, conducted, by, publishing, houses, which, convert, works, of, writing, from, one, language, to, another, in, order, to, reach, varied, audiences, cross, national, and, cross, cultural, survey, research, studies, employ, translation, to, collect, comparable, data, among, multilingual, populations, academic, translators, specialize, in, or, are, familiar, with, various, other, disciplines, such, as, technology, science, law, economics, etc, clinical, linguistics, is, the, application, of, linguistic, theory, to, the, field, of, speech, language, pathology, speech, language, pathologists, work, on, corrective, measures, to, treat, communication, and, swallowing, disorders, computational, linguistics, is, the, study, of, linguistic, issues, in, a, way, that, is, computationally, responsible, i, e, taking, careful, note, of, computational, consideration, of, algorithmic, specification, and, computational, complexity, so, that, the, linguistic, theories, devised, can, be, shown, to, exhibit, certain, desirable, computational, properties, and, their, implementations, computational, linguists, also, work, on, computer, language, and, software, development, evolutionary, linguistics, is, a, sociobiological, approach, to, analyzing, the, emergence, of, the, language, faculty, through, human, evolution, and, also, the, application, of, evolutionary, theory, to, the, study, of, cultural, evolution, among, different, languages, it, is, also, a, study, of, the, dispersal, of, various, languages, across, the, globe, through, movements, among, ancient, communities, forensic, linguistics, is, the, application, of, linguistic, analysis, to, forensics, forensic, analysis, investigates, the, style, language, lexical, use, and, other, linguistic, and, grammatical, features, used, in, the, legal, context, to, provide, evidence, in, courts, of, law, forensic, linguists, have, also, used, their, expertise, in, the, framework, of, criminal, cases
