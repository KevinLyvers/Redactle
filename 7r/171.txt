early, childhood, education, ece, also, known, as, nursery, education, is, a, branch, of, education, theory, that, relates, to, the, teaching, of, children, formally, and, informally, from, birth, up, to, the, age, of, eight, traditionally, this, is, up, to, the, equivalent, of, third, grade, ece, is, described, as, an, important, period, in, child, development, ece, emerged, as, a, field, of, study, during, the, enlightenment, particularly, in, european, countries, with, high, literacy, rates, it, continued, to, grow, through, the, nineteenth, century, as, universal, primary, education, became, a, norm, in, the, western, world, in, recent, years, early, childhood, education, has, become, a, prevalent, public, policy, issue, as, funding, for, preschool, and, pre, k, is, debated, by, municipal, state, and, federal, lawmakers, governing, entities, are, also, debating, the, central, focus, of, early, childhood, education, with, debate, on, developmental, appropriate, play, versus, strong, academic, preparation, curriculum, in, reading, writing, and, math, the, global, priority, placed, on, early, childhood, education, is, underscored, with, targets, of, the, united, nations, sustainable, development, goal, 4, as, of, 2023, however, only, around, 4, in, 10, children, aged, 3, and, 4, attend, early, childhood, education, around, the, world, furthermore, levels, of, participation, vary, widely, by, region, with, around, 2, in, 3, children, in, latin, american, and, the, caribbean, attending, ece, compared, to, just, under, half, of, children, in, south, asia, and, only, 1, in, 4, in, sub, saharan, africa, ece, is, also, a, professional, designation, earned, through, a, post, secondary, education, program, for, example, in, ontario, canada, the, designations, ece, early, childhood, educator, and, rece, registered, early, childhood, educator, may, only, be, used, by, registered, members, of, the, college, of, early, childhood, educators, which, is, made, up, of, accredited, child, care, professionals, who, are, held, accountable, to, the, college, s, standards, of, practice, research, shows, that, early, childhood, education, has, substantial, positive, short, and, long, term, effects, on, the, children, who, attend, such, education, and, that, the, costs, are, dwarfed, by, societal, gains, of, the, education, programs, the, developmental, interaction, approach, is, based, on, the, theories, of, jean, piaget, erik, erikson, john, dewey, and, lucy, sprague, mitchell, the, approach, focuses, on, learning, through, discovery, jean, jacques, rousseau, recommended, that, teachers, should, exploit, individual, children, s, interests, to, make, sure, each, child, obtains, the, information, most, essential, to, his, personal, and, individual, development, the, five, developmental, domains, of, childhood, development, include, to, meet, those, developmental, domains, a, child, has, a, set, of, needs, that, must, be, met, for, learning, maslow, s, hierarchy, of, needs, showcases, the, different, levels, of, needs, that, must, be, met, the, chart, to, the, right, showcases, these, needs, friedrich, froebel, was, a, german, educator, that, believed, in, the, idea, of, children, learning, through, play, specifically, he, said, play, is, the, highest, expression, of, human, development, in, childhood, for, it, alone, is, the, free, expression, of, what, is, in, the, child, s, soul, froebel, believed, that, teachers, should, act, as, a, facilitators, and, supporters, for, the, students, s, play, rather, than, an, authoritative, disciplinary, figure, he, created, educational, open, ended, toys, that, he, called, gifts, and, occupations, that, were, designed, to, encourage, self, expression, and, initiation, maria, montessori, was, an, italian, physician, that, based, on, her, observations, of, young, children, in, classrooms, developed, a, method, of, education, that, focused, on, independence, in, montessori, education, a, typical, classroom, is, made, up, of, students, of, different, ages, and, curriculum, is, based, on, the, students, developmental, stage, which, montessori, called, the, four, planes, of, development, montessori, s, four, planes, of, development, russian, psychologist, lev, vygotsky, proposed, a, socio, cultural, learning, theory, that, emphasized, the, impact, of, social, and, cultural, experiences, on, individual, thinking, and, the, development, of, mental, processes, vygotsky, s, theory, emerged, in, the, 1930s, and, is, still, discussed, today, as, a, means, of, improving, and, reforming, educational, practices, in, vygotsky, s, theories, of, learning, he, also, postulated, the, theory, of, the, zone, of, proximal, development, this, theory, ties, in, with, children, building, off, prior, knowledge, and, gaining, new, knowledge, related, to, skills, they, already, have, in, the, theory, it, describes, how, new, knowledge, or, skills, are, taken, in, if, they, are, not, fully, learned, but, are, starting, to, emerge, a, teacher, or, older, friend, lends, support, to, a, child, learning, a, skill, be, it, building, a, block, castle, tying, a, shoe, or, writing, one, s, name, as, the, child, becomes, more, capable, of, the, steps, of, the, activity, the, adult, or, older, child, withdraws, supports, gradually, until, the, child, is, competent, completing, the, process, on, his, her, own, this, is, done, within, that, activity, s, zone, the, distance, between, where, the, child, is, and, where, he, potentially, will, be, in, each, zone, of, proximal, development, they, build, on, skills, and, grow, by, learning, more, skills, in, their, proximal, development, range, they, build, on, the, skills, by, being, guided, by, teachers, and, parents, they, must, build, from, where, they, are, in, their, zone, of, proximal, development, vygotsky, argued, that, since, cognition, occurs, within, a, social, context, our, social, experiences, shape, our, ways, of, thinking, about, and, interpreting, the, world, people, such, as, parents, grandparents, and, teachers, play, the, roles, of, what, vygotsky, described, as, knowledgeable, and, competent, adults, although, vygotsky, predated, social, constructivists, he, is, commonly, classified, as, one, social, constructivists, believe, that, an, individual, s, cognitive, system, is, a, resditional, learning, time, vygotsky, advocated, that, teachers, facilitate, rather, than, direct, student, learning, teachers, should, provide, a, learning, environment, where, students, can, explore, and, develop, their, learning, without, direct, instruction, his, approach, calls, for, teachers, to, incorporate, students, needs, and, interests, it, is, important, to, do, this, because, students, levels, of, interest, and, abilities, will, vary, and, there, needs, to, be, differentiation, however, teachers, can, enhance, understandings, and, learning, for, students, vygotsky, states, that, by, sharing, meanings, that, are, relevant, to, the, children, s, environment, adults, promote, cognitive, development, as, well, their, teachings, can, influence, thought, processes, and, perspectives, of, students, when, they, are, in, new, and, similar, environments, since, vygotsky, promotes, more, facilitation, in, children, s, learning, he, suggests, that, knowledgeable, people, and, adults, in, particular, can, also, enhance, knowledges, through, cooperative, meaning, making, with, students, in, their, learning, this, can, be, done, through, the, zone, of, proximal, development, by, guiding, children, s, learning, or, thinking, skills, vygotsky, s, approach, encourages, guided, participation, and, student, exploration, with, support, teachers, can, help, students, achieve, their, cognitive, development, levels, through, consistent, and, regular, interactions, of, collaborative, knowledge, making, learning, processes, jean, piaget, s, constructivist, theory, gained, influence, in, the, 1970s, and, 80s, although, piaget, himself, was, primarily, interested, in, a, descriptive, psychology, of, cognitive, development, he, also, laid, the, groundwork, for, a, constructivist, theory, of, learning, piaget, believed, that, learning, comes, from, within, children, construct, their, own, knowledge, of, the, world, through, experience, and, subsequent, reflection, he, said, that, if, logic, itself, is, created, rather, than, being, inborn, it, follows, that, the, first, task, of, education, is, to, form, reasoning, within, piaget, s, framework, teachers, should, guide, children, in, acquiring, their, own, knowledge, rather, than, simply, transferring, knowledge, according, to, piaget, s, theory, when, young, children, encounter, new, information, they, attempt, to, accommodate, and, assimilate, it, into, their, existing, understanding, of, the, world, accommodation, involves, adapting, mental, schemas, and, representations, to, make, them, consistent, with, reality, assimilation, involves, fitting, new, information, into, their, pre, existing, schemas, through, these, two, processes, young, children, learn, by, equilibrating, their, mental, representations, with, reality, they, also, learn, from, mistakes, a, piagetian, approach, emphasizes, experiential, education, in, school, experiences, become, more, hands, on, and, concrete, as, students, explore, through, trial, and, error, thus, crucial, components, of, early, childhood, education, include, exploration, manipulating, objects, and, experiencing, new, environments, subsequent, reflection, on, these, experiences, is, equally, important, piaget, s, concept, of, reflective, abstraction, was, particularly, influential, in, mathematical, education, through, reflective, abstraction, children, construct, more, advanced, cognitive, structures, out, of, the, simpler, ones, they, already, possess, this, allows, children, to, develop, mathematical, constructs, that, cannot, be, learned, through, equilibration, making, sense, of, experiences, through, assimilation, and, accommodation, alone, according, to, piagetian, theory, language, and, symbolic, representation, is, preceded, by, the, development, of, corresponding, mental, representations, research, shows, that, the, level, of, reflective, abstraction, achieved, by, young, children, was, found, to, limit, the, degree, to, which, they, could, represent, physical, quantities, with, written, numerals, piaget, held, that, children, can, invent, their, own, procedures, for, the, four, arithmetical, operations, without, being, taught, any, conventional, rules, piaget, s, theory, implies, that, computers, can, be, a, great, educational, tool, for, young, children, when, used, to, support, the, design, and, construction, of, their, projects, mccarrick, and, xiaoming, found, that, computer, play, is, consistent, with, this, theory, however, plowman, and, stephen, found, that, the, effectiveness, of, computers, is, limited, in, the, preschool, environment, their, results, indicate, that, computers, are, only, effective, when, directed, by, the, teacher, this, suggests, according, to, the, constructivist, theory, that, the, role, of, preschool, teachers, is, critical, in, successfully, adopting, computers, as, they, existed, in, 2003, david, kolb, s, experiential, learning, theory, which, was, influenced, by, john, dewey, kurt, lewin, and, jean, piaget, argues, that, children, need, to, experience, things, to, learn, the, process, whereby, knowledge, is, created, through, the, transformation, of, experience, knowledge, results, from, the, combinations, of, grasping, and, transforming, experience, the, experimental, learning, theory, is, distinctive, in, that, children, are, seen, and, taught, as, individuals, as, a, child, explores, and, observes, teachers, ask, the, child, probing, questions, the, child, can, then, adapt, prior, knowledge, to, learning, new, information, kolb, breaks, down, this, learning, cycle, into, four, stages, concrete, experience, reflective, observation, abstract, conceptualization, and, active, experimentation, children, observe, new, situations, think, about, the, situation, make, meaning, of, the, situation, then, test, that, meaning, in, the, world, around, them, in, recent, decades, studies, have, shown, that, early, childhood, education, is, critical, in, preparing, children, to, enter, and, succeed, in, the, grade, school, classroom, diminishing, their, risk, of, social, emotional, mental, health, problems, and, increasing, their, self, sufficiency, later, in, their, lives, in, other, words, the, child, needs, to, be, taught, to, rationalize, everything, and, to, be, open, to, interpretations, and, critical, thinking, there, is, no, subject, to, be, considered, taboo, starting, with, the, most, basic, knowledge, of, the, world, that, they, live, in, and, ending, with, deeper, areas, such, as, morality, religion, and, science, visual, stimulus, and, response, time, as, early, as, 3, months, can, be, an, indicator, of, verbal, and, performance, iq, at, age, 4, years, when, parents, value, ece, and, its, importance, their, children, generally, have, a, higher, rate, of, attendance, this, allows, children, the, opportunity, to, build, and, nurture, trusting, relationships, with, educators, and, social, relationships, with, peers, by, providing, education, in, a, child, s, most, formative, years, ece, also, has, the, capacity, to, pre, emptively, begin, closing, the, educational, achievement, gap, between, low, and, high, income, students, before, formal, schooling, begins, children, of, low, socioeconomic, status, ses, often, begin, school, already, behind, their, higher, ses, peers, on, average, by, the, time, they, are, three, children, with, high, ses, have, three, times, the, number, of, words, in, their, vocabularies, as, children, with, low, ses, participation, in, ece, however, has, been, proven, to, increase, high, school, graduation, rates, improve, performance, on, standardized, tests, and, reduce, both, grade, repetition, and, the, number, of, children, placed, in, special, education, a, study, was, conducted, by, the, aga, khan, development, network, s, madrasa, early, childhood, programme, on, the, impact, that, early, childhood, education, had, on, students, performance, in, grade, school, looking, specifically, at, students, who, attended, the, madrasa, early, childhood, schools, virtually, all, of, whom, came, from, economically, disadvantaged, backgrounds, the, study, found, that, they, had, consistently, ranked, in, the, top, 20, in, grade, 1, classes, the, study, also, concluded, that, any, formal, early, childhood, education, contributed, to, higher, levels, of, cognitive, development, in, language, mathematics, and, non, verbal, reasoning, skills, especially, since, the, first, wave, of, results, from, the, perry, preschool, project, were, published, there, has, been, widespread, consensus, that, the, quality, of, early, childhood, education, programs, correlate, with, gains, in, low, income, children, s, iqs, and, test, scores, decreased, grade, retention, and, lower, special, education, rates, several, studies, have, reported, that, children, enrolled, in, ece, increase, their, iq, scores, by, 4, 11, points, by, age, five, while, a, milwaukee, study, reported, a, 25, point, gain, in, addition, students, who, had, been, enrolled, in, the, abecedarian, project, an, often, cited, ece, study, scored, significantly, higher, on, reading, and, math, tests, by, age, fifteen, than, comparable, students, who, had, not, participated, in, early, childhood, programs, in, addition, 36, of, students, in, the, abecedarian, preschool, study, treatment, group, would, later, enroll, in, four, year, colleges, compared, to, 14, of, those, in, the, control, group, in, 2017, researchers, reported, that, children, who, participate, in, ece, graduate, high, school, at, significantly, greater, rates, than, those, who, do, not, additionally, those, who, participate, in, ece, require, special, education, and, must, repeat, a, grade, at, significantly, lower, rates, than, their, peers, who, did, not, receive, ece, the, nih, asserts, that, ece, leads, to, higher, test, scores, for, students, from, preschool, through, age, 21, improved, grades, in, math, and, reading, and, stronger, odds, that, students, will, keep, going, to, school, and, attend, college, nathaniel, hendren, and, ben, sprung, keyser, two, harvard, economists, found, high, marginal, values, of, public, funds, mvpfs, for, investments, in, programs, supporting, the, health, and, early, education, of, children, particularly, those, that, reach, children, from, low, income, families, the, average, mvpf, for, these, types, of, initiatives, is, over, 5, while, the, mvpfs, for, programs, for, adults, generally, range, from, 0, 5, to, 2, beyond, benefitting, societal, good, ece, also, significantly, impacts, the, socioeconomic, outcomes, of, individuals, for, example, by, age, 26, students, who, had, been, enrolled, in, chicago, child, parent, centers, were, less, likely, to, be, arrested, abuse, drugs, and, receive, food, stamps, they, were, more, likely, to, have, high, school, diplomas, health, insurance, and, full, time, employment, studies, also, show, that, ece, heightens, social, engagement, bolsters, lifelong, health, reduces, the, incidence, of, teen, pregnancy, supports, mental, health, decreases, the, risk, of, heart, disease, and, lengthens, lifespans, the, world, bank, s, 2019, world, development, report, on, the, changing, nature, of, work, identifies, early, childhood, development, programs, as, one, of, the, most, effective, ways, governments, can, equip, children, with, the, skills, they, will, need, to, succeed, in, future, labor, markets, according, to, a, 2020, study, in, the, journal, of, political, economy, by, clemson, university, economist, jorge, luis, garc, a, nobel, laureate, james, j, heckman, and, university, of, southern, california, economists, duncan, ermini, leaf, and, mar, a, jos, prados, every, dollar, spent, on, a, high, quality, early, childhood, programs, led, to, a, return, of, 7, 3, over, the, long, term, the, perry, preschool, project, which, was, conducted, in, the, 1960s, in, ypsilanti, michigan, is, the, oldest, social, experiment, in, the, field, of, early, childhood, education, and, has, heavily, influenced, policy, in, the, united, states, and, across, the, globe, the, experiment, enrolled, 128, three, and, four, year, old, african, american, children, with, cognitive, disadvantage, from, low, income, families, who, were, then, randomly, assigned, to, treatment, and, control, groups, the, intervention, for, children, in, the, treatment, group, included, active, learning, preschool, sessions, on, weekdays, for, 2, 5, hours, per, day, the, intervention, also, included, weekly, visits, by, the, teachers, to, the, homes, of, the, children, for, about, 1, 5, hours, per, visit, to, improve, parent, child, interactions, at, home, initial, evaluations, of, the, perry, intervention, showed, that, the, preschool, program, failed, to, significantly, boost, an, iq, measure, however, later, evaluations, that, followed, up, the, participants, for, more, than, fifty, years, have, demonstrated, the, long, term, economic, benefits, of, the, program, even, after, accounting, for, the, small, sample, size, of, the, experiment, flaws, in, its, randomization, procedure, and, sample, attrition, there, is, substantial, evidence, of, large, treatment, effects, on, the, criminal, convictions, of, male, participants, especially, for, violent, crime, and, their, earnings, in, middle, adulthood, research, points, to, improvements, in, non, cognitive, skills, executive, functioning, childhood, home, environment, and, parental, attachment, as, potential, sources, of, the, observed, long, term, impacts, of, the, program, the, intervention, s, many, benefits, also, include, improvements, in, late, midlife, health, for, both, male, and, female, participants, perry, promoted, educational, attainment, through, two, avenues, total, years, of, education, attained, and, rates, of, progression, to, a, given, level, of, education, this, pattern, is, particularly, evident, for, females, treated, females, received, less, special, education, progressed, more, quickly, through, grades, earned, higher, gpas, and, attained, higher, levels, of, education, than, their, control, group, counterparts, research, also, demonstrates, spillover, effects, of, the, perry, program, on, the, children, and, siblings, of, the, original, participants, a, study, concludes, the, children, of, treated, participants, have, fewer, school, suspensions, higher, levels, of, education, and, employment, and, lower, levels, of, participation, in, crime, compared, with, the, children, of, untreated, participants, impacts, are, especially, pronounced, for, the, children, of, male, participants, these, treatment, effects, are, associated, with, improved, childhood, home, environments, the, study, also, documents, beneficial, impacts, on, the, male, siblings, of, the, original, participants, evidence, from, the, perry, preschool, project, is, noteworthy, because, it, advocates, for, public, spending, on, early, childhood, programs, as, an, economic, investment, in, a, society, s, future, rather, than, in, the, interest, of, social, justice, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, 1948, the, international, covenant, on, economic, social, and, cultural, rights, 1976, and, the, convention, on, the, rights, of, the, child, 1989, have, all, addressed, childhood, education, article, 28, of, the, convention, on, the, rights, of, the, child, states, that, states, parties, recognized, the, right, of, the, child, to, education, and, with, a, view, to, achieving, this, right, progression, and, on, the, basis, of, equal, opportunity, they, shall, in, particular, the, first, world, conference, on, early, childhood, care, and, education, took, place, in, moscow, from, 27, to, 29, september, 2010, jointly, organized, by, unesco, and, the, city, of, moscow, the, overarching, goals, of, the, conference, are, to, under, goal, 4, of, the, sustainable, development, goals, which, the, un, general, assembly, unanimously, approved, in, 2015, countries, committed, to, ensure, inclusive, and, equitable, quality, education, including, early, childhood, two, targets, related, to, goal, 4, are, by, 2030, ensure, that, all, girls, and, boys, have, access, to, quality, early, childhood, development, care, and, pre, primary, education, so, that, they, are, ready, for, primary, education, the, framework, for, action, adopted, by, unesco, member, states, later, in, 2015, outlines, how, to, translate, this, last, target, into, practice, and, encourages, states, to, provide, at, least, one, year, of, free, and, compulsory, pre, primary, education, of, good, quality, the, sustainable, development, goals, however, are, not, binding, international, law, it, has, been, argued, that, international, law, provides, no, effective, protection, of, the, right, to, pre, primary, education, just, two, global, treaties, explicitly, reference, education, prior, to, primary, school, the, convention, on, the, elimination, of, all, forms, of, discrimination, against, women, requires, states, to, ensure, equality, for, girls, in, pre, school, and, in, the, convention, on, the, protection, of, the, rights, of, all, migrant, workers, and, members, of, their, families, states, agree, that, access, to, public, pre, school, educational, institutions, shall, not, be, denied, due, to, the, parents, or, child, s, irregular, situation, with, respect, to, stay, less, explicitly, the, convention, on, the, rights, of, persons, with, disabilities, requires, that, states, parties, shall, ensure, an, inclusive, education, system, at, all, levels, in, 2022, human, rights, watch, adopted, a, policy, calling, on, states, to, make, at, least, one, year, of, free, and, compulsory, inclusive, quality, pre, primary, education, available, and, accessible, for, all, children, in, doing, so, they, advocated, making, one, year, of, pre, primary, education, to, be, included, as, part, of, the, minimum, core, of, the, right, to, education, they, further, called, on, all, states, to, adopt, a, detailed, plan, of, action, for, the, progressive, implementation, of, further, years, of, pre, primary, education, within, a, reasonable, number, of, years, to, be, fixed, in, the, plan, according, to, unesco, a, preschool, curriculum, is, one, that, delivers, educational, content, through, daily, activities, and, furthers, a, child, s, physical, cognitive, and, social, development, generally, preschool, curricula, are, only, recognized, by, governments, if, they, are, based, on, academic, research, and, reviewed, by, peers, preschool, for, child, rights, have, pioneered, into, preschool, curricular, areas, and, is, contributing, into, child, rights, through, their, preschool, curriculum, curricula, in, early, childhood, care, and, education, ecce, is, the, driving, force, behind, any, ecce, programme, it, is, an, integral, part, of, the, engine, that, together, with, the, energy, and, motivation, of, staff, provides, the, momentum, that, makes, programmes, live, it, follows, therefore, that, the, quality, of, a, programme, is, greatly, influenced, by, the, quality, of, its, curriculum, in, early, childhood, these, may, be, programs, for, children, or, parents, including, health, and, nutrition, interventions, and, prenatal, programs, as, well, as, center, based, programs, for, children, children, s, learning, potential, and, outcomes, are, negatively, affected, by, exposure, to, violence, abuse, and, child, labour, thus, protecting, young, children, from, violence, and, exploitation, is, part, of, broad, educational, concerns, due, to, difficulties, and, sensitivities, around, the, issue, of, measuring, and, monitoring, child, protection, violations, and, gaps, in, defining, collecting, and, analysing, appropriate, indicators, data, coverage, in, this, area, is, scant, however, proxy, indicators, can, be, used, to, assess, the, situation, for, example, ratification, of, relevant, international, conventions, indicates, countries, commitment, to, child, protection, by, april, 2014, 194, countries, had, ratified, the, crc3, and, 179, had, ratified, the, 1999, international, labour, organization, s, convention, no, 182, concerning, the, elimination, of, the, worst, forms, of, child, labour, however, many, of, these, ratifications, are, yet, to, be, given, full, effect, through, actual, implementation, of, concrete, measures, globally, 150, million, children, aged, 5, 14, are, estimated, to, be, engaged, in, child, labour, in, conflict, affected, poor, countries, children, are, twice, as, likely, to, die, before, their, fifth, birthday, compared, to, those, in, other, poor, countries, in, industrialized, countries, 4, per, cent, of, children, are, physically, abused, each, year, and, 10, per, cent, are, neglected, or, psychologically, abused, in, both, developed, and, developing, countries, children, of, the, poor, and, the, disadvantaged, remain, the, least, served, this, exclusion, persists, against, the, evidence, that, the, added, value, of, early, childhood, care, and, education, services, are, higher, for, them, than, for, their, more, affluent, counterparts, even, when, such, services, are, of, modest, quality, while, the, problem, is, more, intractable, in, developing, countries, the, developed, world, still, does, not, equitably, provide, quality, early, childhood, care, and, education, services, for, all, its, children, in, many, european, countries, children, mostly, from, low, income, and, immigrant, families, do, not,
