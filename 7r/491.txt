for, a, global, moratorium, on, executions, with, a, view, to, eventual, abolition, execution, of, criminals, and, dissidents, has, been, used, by, nearly, all, societies, since, the, beginning, of, civilisations, on, earth, until, the, nineteenth, century, without, developed, prison, systems, there, was, frequently, no, workable, alternative, to, ensure, deterrence, and, incapacitation, of, criminals, in, pre, modern, times, the, executions, themselves, often, involved, torture, with, painful, methods, such, as, the, breaking, wheel, keelhauling, sawing, hanging, drawing, and, quartering, burning, at, the, stake, crucifixion, flaying, slow, slicing, boiling, alive, impalement, mazzatello, blowing, from, a, gun, schwedentrunk, and, scaphism, other, methods, which, appear, only, in, legend, include, the, blood, eagle, and, brazen, bull, the, use, of, formal, execution, extends, to, the, beginning, of, recorded, history, most, historical, records, and, various, primitive, tribal, practices, indicate, that, the, death, penalty, was, a, part, of, their, justice, system, communal, punishments, for, wrongdoing, generally, included, blood, money, compensation, by, the, wrongdoer, corporal, punishment, shunning, banishment, and, execution, in, tribal, societies, compensation, and, shunning, were, often, considered, enough, as, a, form, of, justice, the, response, to, crimes, committed, by, neighbouring, tribes, clans, or, communities, included, a, formal, apology, compensation, blood, feuds, and, tribal, warfare, a, blood, feud, or, vendetta, occurs, when, arbitration, between, families, or, tribes, fails, or, an, arbitration, system, is, non, existent, this, form, of, justice, was, common, before, the, emergence, of, an, arbitration, system, based, on, state, or, organized, religion, it, may, result, from, crime, land, disputes, or, a, code, of, honour, acts, of, retaliation, underscore, the, ability, of, the, social, collective, to, defend, itself, and, demonstrate, to, enemies, as, well, as, potential, allies, that, injury, to, property, rights, or, the, person, will, not, go, unpunished, in, most, countries, that, practice, capital, punishment, it, is, now, reserved, for, murder, terrorism, war, crimes, espionage, treason, or, as, part, of, military, justice, in, some, countries, sexual, crimes, such, as, rape, fornication, adultery, incest, sodomy, and, bestiality, carry, the, death, penalty, as, do, religious, crimes, such, as, hudud, zina, and, qisas, crimes, such, as, apostasy, formal, renunciation, of, the, state, religion, blasphemy, moharebeh, hirabah, fasad, mofsed, e, filarz, and, witchcraft, in, many, countries, that, use, the, death, penalty, drug, trafficking, and, often, drug, possession, is, also, a, capital, offence, in, china, human, trafficking, and, serious, cases, of, corruption, and, financial, crimes, are, punished, by, the, death, penalty, in, militaries, around, the, world, courts, martial, have, imposed, death, sentences, for, offences, such, as, cowardice, desertion, insubordination, and, mutiny, elaborations, of, tribal, arbitration, of, feuds, included, peace, settlements, often, done, in, a, religious, context, and, compensation, system, compensation, was, based, on, the, principle, of, substitution, which, might, include, material, for, example, cattle, slaves, land, compensation, exchange, of, brides, or, grooms, or, payment, of, the, blood, debt, settlement, rules, could, allow, for, animal, blood, to, replace, human, blood, or, transfers, of, property, or, blood, money, or, in, some, case, an, offer, of, a, person, for, execution, the, person, offered, for, execution, did, not, have, to, be, an, original, perpetrator, of, the, crime, because, the, social, system, was, based, on, tribes, and, clans, not, individuals, blood, feuds, could, be, regulated, at, meetings, such, as, the, norsemen, things, systems, deriving, from, blood, feuds, may, survive, alongside, more, advanced, legal, systems, or, be, given, recognition, by, courts, for, example, trial, by, combat, or, blood, money, one, of, the, more, modern, refinements, of, the, blood, feud, is, the, duel, in, certain, parts, of, the, world, nations, in, the, form, of, ancient, republics, monarchies, or, tribal, oligarchies, emerged, these, nations, were, often, united, by, common, linguistic, religious, or, family, ties, moreover, expansion, of, these, nations, often, occurred, by, conquest, of, neighbouring, tribes, or, nations, consequently, various, classes, of, royalty, nobility, various, commoners, and, slaves, emerged, accordingly, the, systems, of, tribal, arbitration, were, submerged, into, a, more, unified, system, of, justice, which, formalized, the, relation, between, the, different, social, classes, rather, than, tribes, the, earliest, and, most, famous, example, is, code, of, hammurabi, which, set, the, different, punishment, and, compensation, according, to, the, different, class, or, group, of, victims, and, perpetrators, the, torah, old, testament, lays, down, the, death, penalty, for, murder, kidnapping, practicing, magic, violation, of, the, sabbath, blasphemy, and, a, wide, range, of, sexual, crimes, although, evidence, suggests, that, actual, executions, were, exceedingly, rare, if, they, occurred, at, all, a, further, example, comes, from, ancient, greece, where, the, athenian, legal, system, replacing, customary, oral, law, was, first, written, down, by, draco, in, about, 621, bc, the, death, penalty, was, applied, for, a, particularly, wide, range, of, crimes, though, solon, later, repealed, draco, s, code, and, published, new, laws, retaining, capital, punishment, only, for, intentional, homicide, and, only, with, victim, s, family, permission, the, word, draconian, derives, from, draco, s, laws, the, romans, also, used, the, death, penalty, for, a, wide, range, of, offences, protagoras, whose, thought, is, reported, by, plato, criticised, the, principle, of, revenge, because, once, the, damage, is, done, it, cannot, be, cancelled, by, any, action, so, if, the, death, penalty, is, to, be, imposed, by, society, it, is, only, to, protect, the, latter, against, the, criminal, or, for, a, dissuasive, purpose, the, only, right, that, protagoras, knows, is, therefore, human, right, which, established, and, sanctioned, by, a, sovereign, collectivity, identifies, itself, with, positive, or, the, law, in, force, of, the, city, in, fact, it, finds, its, guarantee, in, the, death, penalty, which, threatens, all, those, who, do, not, respect, it, plato, saw, the, death, penalty, as, a, means, of, purification, because, crimes, are, a, defilement, thus, in, the, laws, he, considered, necessary, the, execution, of, the, animal, or, the, destruction, of, the, object, which, caused, the, death, of, a, man, by, accident, for, the, murderers, he, considered, that, the, act, of, homicide, is, not, natural, and, is, not, fully, consented, by, the, criminal, homicide, is, thus, a, disease, of, the, soul, which, must, be, reeducated, as, much, as, possible, and, as, a, last, resort, sentence, to, death, if, no, rehabilitation, is, possible, according, to, aristotle, for, whom, free, will, is, proper, to, man, a, person, is, responsible, for, their, actions, if, there, was, a, crime, a, judge, must, define, the, penalty, allowing, the, crime, to, be, annulled, by, compensating, it, this, is, how, pecuniary, compensation, appeared, for, criminals, the, least, recalcitrant, and, whose, rehabilitation, is, deemed, possible, however, for, others, he, argued, the, death, penalty, is, necessary, this, philosophy, aims, on, the, one, hand, to, protect, society, and, on, the, other, hand, to, compensate, to, cancel, the, consequences, of, the, crime, committed, it, inspired, western, criminal, law, until, the, 17th, century, a, time, when, the, first, reflections, on, the, abolition, of, the, death, penalty, appeared, the, twelve, tables, the, body, of, laws, handed, down, from, archaic, rome, prescribe, the, death, penalty, for, a, variety, of, crimes, including, libel, arson, and, theft, during, the, late, republic, there, was, consensus, among, the, public, and, legislators, to, reduce, the, incidence, of, capital, punishment, this, opinion, led, to, voluntary, exile, being, prescribed, in, place, of, the, death, penalty, whereby, a, convict, could, either, choose, to, leave, in, exile, or, face, execution, a, historic, debate, followed, by, a, vote, took, place, in, the, roman, senate, to, decide, the, fate, of, catiline, s, allies, when, he, attempted, to, seize, power, in, december, 63, bc, cicero, then, roman, consul, argued, in, support, of, the, killing, of, conspirators, without, judgment, by, decision, of, the, senate, senatus, consultum, ultimum, and, was, supported, by, the, majority, of, senators, among, the, minority, voices, opposed, to, the, execution, the, most, notable, was, julius, caesar, the, custom, was, different, for, foreigners, who, did, not, hold, rights, as, roman, citizens, and, especially, for, slaves, who, were, transferrable, property, crucifixion, was, a, form, of, punishment, first, employed, by, the, romans, against, slaves, who, rebelled, and, throughout, the, republican, era, was, reserved, for, slaves, bandits, and, traitors, intended, to, be, a, punishment, a, humiliation, and, a, deterrent, the, condemned, could, take, up, to, a, few, days, to, die, corpses, of, the, crucified, were, typically, left, on, the, crosses, to, decompose, and, to, be, eaten, by, animals, there, was, a, time, in, the, tang, dynasty, 618, 907, when, the, death, penalty, was, abolished, this, was, in, the, year, 747, enacted, by, emperor, xuanzong, of, tang, r, 712, 756, when, abolishing, the, death, penalty, xuanzong, ordered, his, officials, to, refer, to, the, nearest, regulation, by, analogy, when, sentencing, those, found, guilty, of, crimes, for, which, the, prescribed, punishment, was, execution, thus, depending, on, the, severity, of, the, crime, a, punishment, of, severe, scourging, with, the, thick, rod, or, of, exile, to, the, remote, lingnan, region, might, take, the, place, of, capital, punishment, however, the, death, penalty, was, restored, only, 12, years, later, in, 759, in, response, to, the, an, lushan, rebellion, at, this, time, in, the, tang, dynasty, only, the, emperor, had, the, authority, to, sentence, criminals, to, execution, under, xuanzong, capital, punishment, was, relatively, infrequent, with, only, 24, executions, in, the, year, 730, and, 58, executions, in, the, year, 736, the, two, most, common, forms, of, execution, in, the, tang, dynasty, were, strangulation, and, decapitation, which, were, the, prescribed, methods, of, execution, for, 144, and, 89, offences, respectively, strangulation, was, the, prescribed, sentence, for, lodging, an, accusation, against, one, s, parents, or, grandparents, with, a, magistrate, scheming, to, kidnap, a, person, and, sell, them, into, slavery, and, opening, a, coffin, while, desecrating, a, tomb, decapitation, was, the, method, of, execution, prescribed, for, more, serious, crimes, such, as, treason, and, sedition, despite, the, great, discomfort, involved, most, of, the, tang, chinese, preferred, strangulation, to, decapitation, as, a, result, of, the, traditional, tang, chinese, belief, that, the, body, is, a, gift, from, the, parents, and, that, it, is, therefore, disrespectful, to, one, s, ancestors, to, die, without, returning, one, s, body, to, the, grave, intact, some, further, forms, of, capital, punishment, were, practiced, in, the, tang, dynasty, of, which, the, first, two, that, follow, at, least, were, extralegal, the, first, of, these, was, scourging, to, death, with, the, thick, rod, which, was, common, throughout, the, tang, dynasty, especially, in, cases, of, gross, corruption, the, second, was, truncation, in, which, the, convicted, person, was, cut, in, two, at, the, waist, with, a, fodder, knife, and, then, left, to, bleed, to, death, a, further, form, of, execution, called, ling, chi, slow, slicing, or, death, by, of, a, thousand, cuts, was, used, from, the, close, of, the, tang, dynasty, around, 900, to, its, abolition, in, 1905, when, a, minister, of, the, fifth, grade, or, above, received, a, death, sentence, the, emperor, might, grant, him, a, special, dispensation, allowing, him, to, commit, suicide, in, lieu, of, execution, even, when, this, privilege, was, not, granted, the, law, required, that, the, condemned, minister, be, provided, with, food, and, ale, by, his, keepers, and, transported, to, the, execution, ground, in, a, cart, rather, than, having, to, walk, there, nearly, all, executions, under, the, tang, dynasty, took, place, in, public, as, a, warning, to, the, population, the, heads, of, the, executed, were, displayed, on, poles, or, spears, when, local, authorities, decapitated, a, convicted, criminal, the, head, was, boxed, and, sent, to, the, capital, as, proof, of, identity, and, that, the, execution, had, taken, place, in, medieval, and, early, modern, europe, before, the, development, of, modern, prison, systems, the, death, penalty, was, also, used, as, a, generalised, form, of, punishment, for, even, minor, offences, in, early, modern, europe, a, mass, panic, regarding, witchcraft, swept, across, europe, and, later, the, european, colonies, in, north, america, during, this, period, there, were, widespread, claims, that, malevolent, satanic, witches, were, operating, as, an, organised, threat, to, christendom, as, a, result, tens, of, thousands, of, women, were, prosecuted, for, witchcraft, and, executed, through, the, witch, trials, of, the, early, modern, period, between, the, 15th, and, 18th, centuries, the, death, penalty, also, targeted, sexual, offences, such, as, sodomy, in, the, early, history, of, islam, 7th, 11th, centuries, there, is, a, number, of, purported, but, mutually, inconsistent, reports, athar, regarding, the, punishments, of, sodomy, ordered, by, some, of, the, early, caliphs, abu, bakr, the, first, caliph, of, the, rashidun, caliphate, apparently, recommended, toppling, a, wall, on, the, culprit, or, else, burning, him, alive, while, ali, ibn, abi, talib, is, said, to, have, ordered, death, by, stoning, for, one, sodomite, and, had, another, thrown, head, first, from, the, top, of, the, highest, building, in, the, town, according, to, ibn, abbas, the, latter, punishment, must, be, followed, by, stoning, other, medieval, muslim, leaders, such, as, the, abbasid, caliphs, in, baghdad, most, notably, al, mu, tadid, were, often, cruel, in, their, punishments, in, early, modern, england, the, buggery, act, 1533, stipulated, hanging, as, punishment, for, buggery, james, pratt, and, john, smith, were, the, last, two, englishmen, to, be, executed, for, sodomy, in, 1835, in, 1636, the, laws, of, puritan, governed, plymouth, colony, included, a, sentence, of, death, for, sodomy, and, buggery, the, massachusetts, bay, colony, followed, in, 1641, throughout, the, 19th, century, u, s, states, repealed, death, sentences, from, their, sodomy, laws, with, south, carolina, being, the, last, to, do, so, in, 1873, historians, recognise, that, during, the, early, middle, ages, the, christian, populations, living, in, the, lands, invaded, by, the, arab, muslim, armies, between, the, 7th, and, 10th, centuries, suffered, religious, discrimination, religious, persecution, religious, violence, and, martyrdom, multiple, times, at, the, hands, of, arab, muslim, officials, and, rulers, as, people, of, the, book, christians, under, muslim, rule, were, subjected, to, dhimmi, status, along, with, jews, samaritans, gnostics, mandeans, and, zoroastrians, which, was, inferior, to, the, status, of, muslims, christians, and, other, religious, minorities, thus, faced, religious, discrimination, and, religious, persecution, in, that, they, were, banned, from, proselytising, for, christians, it, was, forbidden, to, evangelise, or, spread, christianity, in, the, lands, invaded, by, the, arab, muslims, on, pain, of, death, they, were, banned, from, bearing, arms, undertaking, certain, professions, and, were, obligated, to, dress, differently, in, order, to, distinguish, themselves, from, arabs, under, sharia, non, muslims, were, obligated, to, pay, jizya, and, kharaj, taxes, together, with, periodic, heavy, ransom, levied, upon, christian, communities, by, muslim, rulers, in, order, to, fund, military, campaigns, all, of, which, contributed, a, significant, proportion, of, income, to, the, islamic, states, while, conversely, reducing, many, christians, to, poverty, and, these, financial, and, social, hardships, forced, many, christians, to, convert, to, islam, christians, unable, to, pay, these, taxes, were, forced, to, surrender, their, children, to, the, muslim, rulers, as, payment, who, would, sell, them, as, slaves, to, muslim, households, where, they, were, forced, to, convert, to, islam, many, christian, martyrs, were, executed, under, the, islamic, death, penalty, for, defending, their, christian, faith, through, dramatic, acts, of, resistance, such, as, refusing, to, convert, to, islam, repudiation, of, the, islamic, religion, and, subsequent, reconversion, to, christianity, and, blasphemy, towards, muslim, beliefs, despite, the, wide, use, of, the, death, penalty, calls, for, reform, were, not, unknown, the, 12th, century, jewish, legal, scholar, moses, maimonides, wrote, it, is, better, and, more, satisfactory, to, acquit, a, thousand, guilty, persons, than, to, put, a, single, innocent, man, to, death, he, argued, that, executing, an, accused, criminal, on, anything, less, than, absolute, certainty, would, lead, to, a, slippery, slope, of, decreasing, burdens, of, proof, until, we, would, be, convicting, merely, according, to, the, judge, s, caprice, maimonides, s, concern, was, maintaining, popular, respect, for, law, and, he, saw, errors, of, commission, as, much, more, threatening, than, errors, of, omission, while, during, the, middle, ages, the, expiatory, aspect, of, the, death, penalty, was, taken, into, account, this, is, no, longer, the, case, under, the, lumi, res, these, define, the, place, of, man, within, society, no, longer, according, to, a, divine, rule, but, as, a, contract, established, at, birth, between, the, citizen, and, the, society, it, is, the, social, contract, from, that, moment, on, capital, punishment, should, be, seen, as, useful, to, society, through, its, dissuasive, effect, but, also, as, a, means, of, protection, of, the, latter, vis, vis, criminals, in, the, last, several, centuries, with, the, emergence, of, modern, nation, states, justice, came, to, be, increasingly, associated, with, the, concept, of, natural, and, legal, rights, the, period, saw, an, increase, in, standing, police, forces, and, permanent, penitential, institutions, rational, choice, theory, a, utilitarian, approach, to, criminology, which, justifies, punishment, as, a, form, of, deterrence, as, opposed, to, retribution, can, be, traced, back, to, cesare, beccaria, whose, influential, treatise, on, crimes, and, punishments, 1764, was, the, first, detailed, analysis, of, capital, punishment, to, demand, the, abolition, of, the, death, penalty, in, england, jeremy, bentham, 1748, 1832, the, founder, of, modern, utilitarianism, called, for, the, abolition, of, the, death, penalty, beccaria, and, later, charles, dickens, and, karl, marx, noted, the, incidence, of, increased, violent, criminality, at, the, times, and, places, of, executions, official, recognition, of, this, phenomenon, led, to, executions, being, carried, out, inside, prisons, away, from, public, view, in, england, in, the, 18th, century, when, there, was, no, police, force, parliament, drastically, increased, the, number, of, capital, offences, to, more, than, 200, these, were, mainly, property, offences, for, example, cutting, down, a, cherry, tree, in, an, orchard, in, 1820, there, were, 160, including, crimes, such, as, shoplifting, petty, theft, or, stealing, cattle, the, severity, of, the, so, called, bloody, code, was, often, tempered, by, juries, who, refused, to, convict, or, judges, in, the, case, of, petty, theft, who, arbitrarily, set, the, value, stolen, at, below, the, statutory, level, for, a, capital, crime, in, nazi, germany, there, were, three, types, of, capital, punishment, hanging, decapitation, and, death, by, shooting, also, modern, military, organisations, employed, capital, punishment, as, a, means, of, maintaining, military, discipline, in, the, past, cowardice, absence, without, leave, desertion, insubordination, shirking, under, enemy, fire, and, disobeying, orders, were, often, crimes, punishable, by, death, see, decimation, and, running, the, gauntlet, one, method, of, execution, since, firearms, came, into, common, use, has, also, been, firing, squad, although, some, countries, use, execution, with, a, single, shot, to, the, head, or, neck, various, authoritarian, states, employed, the, death, penalty, as, a, potent, means, of, political, oppression, anti, soviet, author, robert, conquest, claimed, that, more, than, one, million, soviet, citizens, were, executed, during, the, great, purge, of, 1936, to, 1938, almost, all, by, a, bullet, to, the, back, of, the, head, mao, zedong, publicly, stated, that, 800, 000, people, had, been, executed, in, china, during, the, cultural, revolution, 1966, 1976, partly, as, a, response, to, such, excesses, civil, rights, organisations, started, to, place, increasing, emphasis, on, the, concept, of, human, rights, and, an, abolition, of, the, death, penalty, by, continent, all, european, countries, but, one, have, abolished, capital, punishment, many, oceanian, countries, have, abolished, it, most, countries, in, the, americas, have, abolished, its, use, while, a, few, actively, retain, it, less, than, half, of, countries, in, africa, retain, it, and, the, majority, of, countries, in, asia, retain, it, for, example, china, japan, and, india, abolition, was, often, adopted, due, to, political, change, as, when, countries, shifted, from, authoritarianism, to, democracy, or, when, it, became, an, entry, condition, for, the, eu, the, united, states, is, a, notable, exception, some, states, have, had, bans, on, capital, punishment, for, decades, the, earliest, being, michigan, where, it, was, abolished, in, 1846, while, other, states, still, actively, use, it, today, the, death, penalty, in, the, united, states, remains, a, contentious, issue, which, is, hotly, debated, in, retentionist, countries, the, debate, is, sometimes, revived, when, a, miscarriage, of, justice, has, occurred, though, this, tends, to, cause, legislative, efforts, to, improve, the, judicial, process, rather, than, to, abolish, the, death, penalty, in, abolitionist, countries, the,

of, the, world, considers, public, executions, to, be, distasteful, and, most, countries, have, outlawed, the, practice, throughout, much, of, history, executions, were, performed, publicly, as, a, means, for, the, state, to, demonstrate, its, power, before, those, who, fell, under, its, jurisdiction, be, they, criminals, enemies, or, political, opponents, additionally, it, afforded, the,

the, maximum, penalty, available, to, the, international, criminal, court, is, life, imprisonment, intentional, homicide, is, punishable, by, death, in, most, countries, retaining, capital, punishment, but, generally, provided, it, involves, an, aggravating, factor, required, by, statute, or, judicial, precedents, some, countries, including, singapore, and, malaysia, made, the, death, penalty, mandatory, for, murder, though, singapore, later, changed, its, laws, since, 2013, to, reserve, the, mandatory, death, sentence, for, intentional, murder, while, providing, an, alternative, sentence, of, life, imprisonment, with, without, caning, for, murder, with, no, intention, to, cause, death, which, allowed, some, convicted, murderers, on, death, row, in, singapore, including, kho, jabing, to, apply, for, the, reduction, of, their, death, sentences, after, the, courts, in, singapore, confirmed, that, they, committed, murder, without, the, intention, to, kill, and, thus, eligible, for, re, sentencing, under, the, new, death, penalty, laws, in, singapore, in, october, 2018, the, malaysian, government, imposed, a, moratorium, on, all, executions, until, the, passage, of, a, new, law, that, would, abolish, the, death, penalty, in, april, 2023, legislation, abolishing, the, mandatory, death, penalty, was, passed, in, malaysia, the, death, penalty, would, be,

drug, couriers, and, had, assisted, the, authorities, in, tackling, drug, related, activities, would, be, sentenced, to, life, imprisonment, instead, of, death, with, the, offender, liable, to, at, least, 15, strokes, of, the, cane, if, he, was, not, sentenced, to, death, and, was, simultaneously, sentenced, to, caning, as, well, notably, drug, couriers, like, yong, vui, kong, and, cheong, chun,

abolishing, the, mandatory, death, penalty, was, passed, in, malaysia, other, crimes, that, are, punishable, by, death, in, some, countries, include, death, penalty, opponents, regard, the, death, penalty, as, inhumane, and, criticize, it, for, its, irreversibility, they, argue, also, that, capital, punishment, lacks, deterrent, effect, or, has, a, brutalization, effect, discriminates, against, minorities, and, the, poor, and, that, it, encourages, a, culture, of, violence, there, are, many, organizations, worldwide, such, as, amnesty, international, and, country, specific, such, as, the, american, civil, liberties, union, aclu, whose, main, purpose, includes, abolition, of, the, death, penalty, advocates, of, the, death, penalty, argue, that, it, deters, crime, is, a, good, tool, for, police, and, prosecutors, in, plea, bargaining, makes, sure, that, convicted, criminals, do, not, offend, again, and, that, it, ensures, justice, for, crimes, such, as, homicide, where, other, penalties, will, not, inflict, the, desired, retribution, demanded, by, the, crime, itself, capital, punishment, for, non, lethal, crimes, is, usually, considerably, more, controversial, and, abolished, in, many, of, the, countries, that, retain, it, supporters, of, the, death, penalty, argued, that, death, penalty, is, morally, justified, when, applied, in, murder, especially, with, aggravating, elements, such, as, for, murder, of, police, officers, child, murder, torture, murder, multiple, homicide, and, mass, killing, such, as, terrorism, massacre, and, genocide, this, argument, is, strongly, defended, by, new, york, law, school, s, professor, robert, blecker, who, says, that, the, punishment, must, be, painful, in, proportion, to, the, crime, eighteenth, century, philosopher, immanuel, kant, defended, a, more, extreme, position, according, to, which, every, murderer, deserves, to, die, on, the, grounds, that, loss, of, life, is, incomparable, to, any, penalty, that, allows, them, to, remain, alive, including, life, imprisonment, some, abolitionists, argue, that, retribution, is, simply, revenge, and, cannot, be, condoned, others, while, accepting, retribution, as, an, element, of, criminal, justice, nonetheless, argue, that, life, without, parole, is, a, sufficient, substitute, it, is, also, argued, that, the, punishing, of, a, killing, with, another, death, is, a, relatively, unusual, punishment, for, a, violent, act, because, in, general, violent, crimes, are, not, punished, by, subjecting, the, perpetrator, to, a, similar, act, e, g, rapists, are, typically, not, punished, by, corporal, punishment, although, it, may, be, inflicted, in, singapore, for, example, abolitionists, believe, capital, punishment, is, the, worst, violation, of, human, rights, because, the, right, to, life, is, the, most, important, and, capital, punishment, violates, it, without, necessity, and, inflicts, to, the, condemned, a, psychological, torture, human, rights, activists, oppose, the, death, penalty, calling, it, cruel, inhuman, and, degrading, punishment, amnesty, international, considers, it, to, be, the, ultimate, irreversible, denial, of, human, rights, albert, camus, wrote, in, a, 1956, book, called, reflections, on, the, guillotine, resistance, rebellion, death, an, execution, is, not, simply, death, it, is, just, as, different, from, the, privation, of, life, as, a, concentration, camp, is, from, prison, for, there, to, be, an, equivalency, the, death, penalty, would, have, to, punish, a, criminal, who, had, warned, his, victim, of, the, date, at, which, he, would, inflict, a, horrible, death, on, him, and, who, from, that, moment, onward, had, confined, him, at, his, mercy, for, months, such, a, monster, is, not, encountered, in, private, life, in, the, classic, doctrine, of, natural, rights, as, expounded, by, for, instance, locke, and, blackstone, on, the, other, hand, it, is, an, important, idea, that, the, right, to, life, can, be, forfeited, as, most, other, rights, can, be, given, due, process, is, observed, such, as, the, right, to, property, and, the, right, to, freedom, including, provisionally, in, anticipation, of, an, actual, verdict, as, john, stuart, mill, explained, in, a, speech, given, in, parliament, against, an, amendment, to, abolish, capital, punishment, for, murder, in, 1868, and, we, may, imagine, somebody, asking, how, we, can, teach, people, not, to, inflict, suffering, by, ourselves, inflicting, it, but, to, this, i, should, answer, all, of, us, would, answer, that, to, deter, by, suffering, from, inflicting, suffering, is, not, only, possible, but, the, very, purpose, of, penal, justice, does, fining, a, criminal, show, want, of, respect, for, property, or, imprisoning, him, for, personal, freedom, just, as, unreasonable, is, it, to, think, that, to, take, the, life, of, a, man, who, has, taken, that, of, another, is, to, show, want, of, regard, for, human, life, we, show, on, the, contrary, most, emphatically, our, regard, for, it, by, the, adoption, of, a, rule, that, he, who, violates, that, right, in, another, forfeits, it, for, himself, and, that, while, no, other, crime, that, he, can, commit, deprives, him, of, his, right, to, live, this, shall, in, one, of, the, most, recent, cases, relating, to, the, death, penalty, in, singapore, activists, like, jolovan, wham, kirsten, han, and, kokila, annamalai, and, even, the, international, groups, like, the, united, nations, and, european, union, argued, for, malaysian, drug, trafficker, nagaenthran, k, dharmalingam, who, has, been, on, death, row, at, singapore, s, changi, prison, since, 2010, should, not, be, executed, due, to, an, alleged, intellectual, disability, as, they, argued, that, nagaenthran, has, low, iq, of, 69, and, a, psychiatrist, has, assessed, him, to, be, mentally, impaired, to, an, extent, that, he, should, not, be, held, liable, to, his, crime, and, execution, they, also, cited, international, law, where, a, country, should, be, prohibiting, the, execution, of, mentally, and, intellectually, impaired, people, in, order, to, push, for, singapore, to, commute, nagaenthran, s, death, penalty, to, life, imprisonment, based, on, protection, of, human, rights, however, the, singapore, government, and, both, singapore, s, high, court, and, court, of, appeal, maintained, their, firm, stance, that, despite, his, certified, low, iq, it, is, confirmed, that, nagaenthran, is, not, mentally, or, intellectually, disabled, based, on, the, joint, opinion, of, three, government, psychiatrists, as, he, is, able, to, fully, understand, the, magnitude, of, his, actions, and, has, no, problem, in, his, daily, functioning, of, life, despite, the, international, outcry, nagaenthran, was, executed, on, 27, april, 2022, trends, in, most, of, the, world, have, long, been, to, move, to, private, and, less, painful, executions, france, adopted, the, guillotine, for, this, reason, in, the, final, years, of, the, 18th, century, while, britain, banned, hanging, drawing, and, quartering, in, the, early, 19th, century, hanging, by, turning, the, victim, off, a, ladder, or, by, kicking, a, stool, or, a, bucket, which, causes, death, by, strangulation, was, replaced, by, long, drop, hanging, where, the, subject, is, dropped, a, longer, distance, to, dislocate, the, neck, and, sever, the, spinal, cord, mozaffar, ad, din, shah, qajar, shah, of, persia, 1896, 1907, introduced, throat, cutting, and, blowing, from, a, gun, close, range, cannon, fire, as, quick, and, relatively, painless, alternatives, to, more, torturous, methods, of, executions, used, at, that, time, in, the, united, states, electrocution, and, gas, inhalation, were, introduced, as, more, humane, alternatives, to, hanging, but, have, been, almost, entirely, superseded, by, lethal, injection, a, small, number, of, countries, for, example, iran, and, saudi, arabia, still, employ, slow, hanging, methods, decapitation, and, stoning, a, study, of, executions, carried, out, in, the, united, states, between, 1977, and, 2001, indicated, that, at, least, 34, of, the, 749, executions, or, 4, 5, involved, unanticipated, problems, or, delays, that, caused, at, least, arguably, unnecessary, agony, for, the, prisoner, or, that, reflect, gross, incompetence, of, the, executioner, the, rate, of, these, botched, executions, remained, steady, over, the, period, of, the, study, a, separate, study, published, in, the, lancet, in, 2005, found, that, in, 43, of, cases, of, lethal, injection, the, blood, level, of, hypnotics, was, insufficient, to, guarantee, unconsciousness, however, the, u, s, supreme, court, ruled, in, 2008, baze, v, rees, and, again, in, 2015, glossip, v, gross, that, lethal, injection, does, not, constitute, cruel, and, unusual, punishment, in, bucklew, v, precythe, the, majority, verdict, written, by, judge, neil, gorsuch, further, affirmed, this, principle, stating, that, while, the, ban, on, cruel, and, unusual, punishment, affirmatively, bans, penalties, that, deliberately, inflict, pain, and, degradation, it, does, in, no, sense, limit, the, possible, infliction, of, pain, in, the, execution, of, a, capital, verdict, it, is, frequently, argued, that, capital, punishment, leads, to, miscarriage, of, justice, through, the, wrongful, execution, of, innocent, persons, many, people, have, been, proclaimed, innocent, victims, of, the, death, penalty, some, have, claimed, that, as, many, as, 39, executions, have, been, carried, out, in, the, face, of, compelling, evidence, of, innocence, or, serious, doubt, about, guilt, in, the, us, from, 1992, through, 2004, newly, available, dna, evidence, prevented, the, pending, execution, of, more, than, 15, death, row, inmates, during, the, same, period, in, the, us, but, dna, evidence, is, only, available, in, a, fraction, of, capital, cases, as, of, 2017, 159, prisoners, on, death, row, have, been, exonerated, by, dna, or, other, evidence, which, is, seen, as, an, indication, that, innocent, prisoners, have, almost, certainly, been, executed, the, national, coalition, to, abolish, the, death, penalty, claims, that, between, 1976, and, 2015, 1, 414, prisoners, in, the, united, states, have, been, executed, while, 156, sentenced, to, death, have, had, their, death, sentences, vacated, it, is, impossible, to, assess, how, many, have, been, wrongly, executed, since, courts, do, not, generally, investigate, the, innocence, of, a, dead, defendant, and, defense, attorneys, tend, to, concentrate, their, efforts, on, clients, whose, lives, can, still, be, saved, however, there, is, strong, evidence, of, innocence, in, many, cases, improper, procedure, may, also, result, in, unfair, executions, for, example, amnesty, international, argues, that, in, singapore, the, misuse, of, drugs, act, contains, a, series, of, presumptions, which, shift, the, burden, of, proof, from, the, prosecution, to, the, accused, this, conflicts, with, the, universally, guaranteed, right, to, be, presumed, innocent, until, proven, guilty, singapore, s, misuse, of, drugs, act, presumes, one, is, guilty, of, possession, of, drugs, if, as, examples, one, is, found, to, be, present, or, escaping, from, a, location, proved, or, presumed, to, be, used, for, the, purpose, of, smoking, or, administering, a, controlled, drug, if, one, is, in, possession, of, a, key, to, a, premises, where, drugs, are, present, if, one, is, in, the, company, of, another, person, found, to, be, in, possession, of, illegal, drugs, or, if, one, tests, positive, after, being, given, a, mandatory, urine, drug, screening, urine, drug, screenings, can, be, given, at, the, discretion, of, police, without, requiring, a, search, warrant, the, onus, is, on, the, accused, in, all, of, the, above, situations, to, prove, that, they, were, not, in, possession, of, or, consumed, illegal, drugs, some, prisoners, have, volunteered, or, attempted, to, expedite, capital, punishment, often, by, waiving, all, appeals, prisoners, have, made, requests, or, committed, further, crimes, in, prison, as, well, in, the, united, states, execution, volunteers, constitute, approximately, 11, of, prisoners, on, death, row, volunteers, often, bypass, legal, procedures, which, are, designed, to, designate, the, death, penalty, for, the, worst, of, the, worst, offenders, opponents, of, execution, volunteering, cited, the, prevalence, of, mental, illness, among, volunteers, comparing, it, to, suicide, execution, volunteers, have, received, considerably, less, attention, and, effort, at, legal, reform, than, those, who, were, exonerated, after, execution, opponents, of, the, death, penalty, argue, that, this, punishment, is, being, used, more, often, against, perpetrators, from, racial, and, ethnic, minorities, and, from, lower, socioeconomic, backgrounds, than, against, those, criminals, who, come, from, a, privileged, background, and, that, the, background, of, the, victim, also, influences, the, outcome, researchers, have, shown, that, white, americans, are, more, likely, to, support, the, death, penalty, when, told, that, it, is, mostly, applied, to, black, americans, and, that, more, stereotypically, black, looking, or, dark, skinned, defendants, are, more, likely, to, be, sentenced, to, death, if, the, case, involves, a, white, victim, however, a, study, published, in, 2018, failed, to, replicate, the, findings, of, earlier, studies, that, had, concluded, that, white, americans, are, more, likely, to, support, the, death, penalty, if, informed, that, it, is, largely, applied, to, black, americans, according, to, the, authors, their, findings, may, result, from, changes, since, 2001, in, the, effects, of, racial, stimuli, on, white, attitudes, about, the, death, penalty, or, their, willingness, to, express, those, attitudes, in, a, survey, context, in, alabama, in, 2019, a, death, row, inmate, named, domineque, ray, was, denied, his, imam, in, the, room, during, his, execution, instead, only, offered, a, christian, chaplain, after, filing, a, complaint, a, federal, court, of, appeals, ruled, 5, 4, against, ray, s, request, the, majority, cited, the, last, minute, nature, of, the, request, and, the, dissent, stated, that, the, treatment, went, against, the, core, principle, of, denominational, neutrality, in, july, 2019, two, shiite, men, ali, hakim, al, arab, 25, and, ahmad, al, malali, 24, were, executed, in, bahrain, despite, the, protests, from, the, united, nations, and, rights, group, amnesty, international, stated, that, the, executions, were, being, carried, out, on, confessions, of, terrorism, crimes, that, were, obtained, through, torture, on, 30, march, 2022, despite, the, appeals, by, the, united, nations, and, rights, activists, 68, year, old, malay, singaporean, abdul, kahar, othman, was, hanged, at, singapore, s, changi, prison, for, illegally, trafficking, diamorphine, which, marked, the, first, execution, in, singapore, since, 2019, as, a, result, of, an, informal, moratorium, caused, by, the, covid, 19, pandemic, earlier, there, were, appeals, made, to, advocate, for, abdul, kahar, s, death, penalty, be, commuted, to, life, imprisonment, on, humanitarian, grounds, as, abdul, kahar, came, from, a, poor, family, and, has, struggled, with, drug, addiction, he, was, also, revealed, to, have, been, spending, most, of, his, life, going, in, and, out, of, prison, including, a, ten, year, sentence, of, preventive, detention, from, 1995, to, 2005, and, has, not, been, given, much, time, for, rehabilitation, which, made, the, activists, and, groups, arguing, that, abdul, kahar, should, be, given, a, chance, for, rehabilitation, instead, of, subjecting, him, to, execution, both, the, european, union, eu, and, amnesty, international, criticised, singapore, for, finalizing, and, carrying, out, abdul, kahar, s, execution, and, about, 400, singaporeans, protested, against, the, government, s, use, of, the, death, penalty, merely,
