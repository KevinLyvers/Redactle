tendency, jefferson, had, spent, 50, years, accumulating, a, wide, variety, of, books, in, several, languages, and, on, subjects, such, as, philosophy, history, law, religion, architecture, travel, natural, sciences, mathematics, studies, of, classical, greece, and, rome, modern, inventions, hot, air, balloons, music, submarines, fossils, agriculture, and, meteorology, he, had, also, collected, books, on, topics, not, normally, viewed, as, part, of, a, legislative, library, such, as, cookbooks, but, he, believed, that, all, subjects, had, a, place, in, the, library, of, congress, he, remarked, i, do, not, know, that, it, contains, any, branch, of, science, which, congress, would, wish, to, exclude, from, their, collection, there, is, in, fact, no, subject, to, which, a, member, of, congress, may, not, have, occasion, to, refer, jefferson, s, collection, was, unique, in, that, it, was, the, working, collection, of, a, scholar, not, a, gentleman, s, collection, for, display, with, the, addition, of, his, collection, which, doubled, the, size, of, the, original, library, the, library, of, congress, was, transformed, from, a, specialist, s, library, to, a, more, general, one, his, original, collection, was, organized, into, a, scheme, based, on, francis, bacon, s, organization, of, knowledge, specifically, jefferson, had, grouped, his, books, into, memory, reason, and, imagination, and, broke, them, into, 44, more, subdivisions, the, library, followed, jefferson, s, organization, scheme, until, the, late, 19th, century, when, librarian, herbert, putnam, began, work, on, a, more, flexible, library, of, congress, classification, structure, this, now, applies, to, more, than, 138, million, items, a, february, 24, 1824, report, from, the, committee, of, ways, and, means, stemming, from, a, request, by, the, house, of, representatives, to, inquire, into, the, expediency, of, appropriating, five, thousand, dollars, for, the, use, of, the, library, of, congress, recommended, the, appropriation, and, noted, that, the, committee, have, discovered, the, library, of, congress, in, its, present, state, to, be, defective, in, all, the, principal, branches, of, literature, and, they, deem, it, of, the, first, necessity, that, this, deficiency, should, be, speedily, supplied, at, least, in, the, important, branches, of, law, politics, commerce, history, and, geography, as, most, useful, to, the, members, of, congress, on, december, 24, 1851, the, largest, fire, in, the, library, s, history, destroyed, 35, 000, books, two, thirds, of, the, library, s, collection, and, two, thirds, of, jefferson, s, original, transfer, congress, appropriated, 168, 700, to, replace, the, lost, books, in, 1852, but, not, to, acquire, new, materials, by, 2008, the, librarians, of, congress, had, found, replacements, for, all, but, 300, of, the, works, that, had, been, documented, as, being, in, jefferson, s, original, collection, this, marked, the, start, of, a, conservative, period, in, the, library, s, administration, by, librarian, john, silva, meehan, and, joint, committee, chairman, james, a, pearce, who, restricted, the, library, s, activities, meehan, and, pearce, s, views, about, a, restricted, scope, for, the, library, of, congress, reflected, those, shared, by, members, of, congress, while, meehan, was, a, librarian, he, supported, and, perpetuated, the, notion, that, the, congressional, library, should, play, a, limited, role, on, the, national, scene, and, that, its, collections, by, and, large, should, emphasize, american, materials, of, obvious, use, to, the, u, s, congress, in, 1859, congress, transferred, the, library, s, public, document, distribution, activities, to, the, department, of, the, interior, and, its, international, book, exchange, program, to, the, department, of, state, during, the, 1850s, smithsonian, institution, librarian, charles, coffin, jewett, aggressively, tried, to, develop, the, smithsonian, as, the, united, states, national, library, his, efforts, were, rejected, by, smithsonian, secretary, joseph, henry, who, advocated, a, focus, on, scientific, research, and, publication, to, reinforce, his, intentions, for, the, smithsonian, henry, established, laboratories, developed, a, robust, physical, sciences, library, and, started, the, smithsonian, contributions, to, knowledge, the, first, of, many, publications, intended, to, disseminate, research, results, for, henry, the, library, of, congress, was, the, obvious, choice, as, the, national, library, unable, to, resolve, the, conflict, henry, dismissed, jewett, in, july, 1854, in, 1865, the, smithsonian, building, also, called, the, castle, due, to, its, norman, architectural, style, was, severely,

regarded, as, the, most, political, to, date, stephenson, was, a, physician, and, spent, equal, time, serving, as, librarian, and, as, a, physician, in, the, union, army, he, could, manage, this, division, of, interest, because, he, hired, ainsworth, rand, spofford, as, his, assistant, despite, his, new, job, stephenson, focused, on, the, war, three, weeks, into, his, term, as, librarian, of, congress, he, left, washington, d, c, to, serve, as, a, volunteer, aide, de, camp, at, the, battles, of, chancellorsville, and, gettysburg, during, the, american, civil, war, stephenson, s, hiring, of, spofford, who, directed, the, library, in, his, absence, may, have, been, his, most, significant, achievement, librarian, ainsworth, rand, spofford, who, directed, the, library, of, congress,
