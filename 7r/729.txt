agreeableness, is, a, personality, trait, referring, to, individuals, that, are, perceived, as, kind, sympathetic, cooperative, warm, honest, and, considerate, in, personality, psychology, agreeableness, is, one, of, the, five, major, dimensions, of, personality, structure, reflecting, individual, differences, in, cooperation, and, social, harmony, people, who, score, high, on, measures, of, agreeableness, are, empathetic, and, altruistic, while, those, with, low, agreeableness, are, prone, to, selfish, competitive, behavior, and, a, lack, of, empathy, those, who, score, very, low, on, agreeableness, may, show, dark, triad, tendencies, such, as, narcissistic, antisocial, and, manipulative, behavior, agreeableness, is, considered, to, be, a, superordinate, trait, meaning, that, it, is, a, grouping, of, personality, sub, traits, that, cluster, together, statistically, the, lower, level, traits, or, facets, that, are, grouped, under, agreeableness, are, trust, straightforwardness, altruism, compliance, modesty, and, tender, mindedness, as, is, the, case, with, all, big, five, personality, traits, the, roots, of, the, modern, concept, of, agreeableness, can, be, traced, to, a, 1936, study, by, gordon, allport, and, henry, s, odbert, seven, years, after, that, study, raymond, cattell, published, a, cluster, analysis, of, the, thousands, of, personality, related, words, identified, by, allport, and, odbert, the, clusters, identified, in, this, study, served, as, a, foundation, for, cattell, s, further, attempts, to, identify, fundamental, universal, human, personality, factors, cattell, eventually, determined, 16, personality, factors, 16pf, by, means, of, factor, analysis, further, factor, analyses, revealed, five, higher, order, or, global, factors, that, encompass, these, 16, although, labelled, independence, by, cattell, one, of, the, global, factors, identified, by, the, 16pf, questionnaire, was, an, early, precursor, to, the, modern, concept, of, agreeableness, agreeableness, in, the, five, factor, model, of, personality, is, most, commonly, measured, by, self, report, although, peer, reports, and, third, party, observation, can, also, be, used, self, report, measures, are, either, lexical, or, based, on, statements, which, measure, is, used, depends, on, an, assessment, of, psychometric, properties, and, the, time, and, space, constraints, of, the, research, being, undertaken, lexical, measures, use, individual, adjectives, that, reflect, agreeableness, or, disagreeableness, traits, such, as, sympathetic, cooperative, warm, considerate, harsh, unkind, rude, words, representing, disagreeableness, are, reverse, coded, goldberg, 1992, developed, a, 20, word, measure, as, part, of, his, 100, word, big, five, markers, and, saucier, 1994, developed, a, briefer, 8, word, measure, as, part, of, his, 40, word, mini, markers, thompson, 2008, revised, these, markers, to, develop, a, 40, word, measure, with, better, psychometric, properties, in, both, american, and, non, american, populations, the, international, english, mini, markers, this, brief, measure, has, good, internal, consistency, reliabilities, and, other, validity, for, assessing, agreeableness, and, other, five, factor, personality, dimensions, both, within, and, especially, without, american, populations, internal, consistency, reliability, of, the, agreeableness, measure, for, native, english, speakers, is, reported, as, 86, that, for, non, native, english, speakers, is, 80, statement, measures, tend, to, comprise, more, words, and, hence, consume, more, research, instrument, space, than, lexical, measures, respondents, are, asked, the, extent, to, which, they, for, example, on, good, terms, with, nearly, everyone, not, interested, in, other, people, s, problems, or, ympathize, with, others, feelings, cattell, s, factor, analytic, approach, which, aimed, to, identify, universal, personality, structures, inspired, many, studies, in, the, decades, following, the, introduction, of, the, 16pf, using, cattell, s, original, clusters, the, 16pf, and, original, data, multiple, researchers, independently, developed, a, five, factor, model, of, personality, over, this, period, from, the, early, 1960s, on, these, explorations, typically, included, a, factor, called, agreeableness, or, sociability, despite, repeated, replications, of, five, stable, personality, factors, following, cattell, s, pioneering, work, this, framework, only, began, to, dominate, personality, research, in, the, early, 1980s, with, the, work, of, lewis, goldberg, using, lexical, studies, similar, to, those, of, allport, and, odbert, goldberg, chose, the, term, big, five, to, reflect, the, sheer, number, of, personality, related, terms, encompassed, by, each, of, these, five, distinct, factors, one, of, these, agreeableness, was, defined, by, a, number, of, personality, related, words, similar, to, those, present, in, earlier, and, more, recent, manifestations, of, the, construct, examples, include, friendly, good, natured, cooperative, trustful, nurturing, sociable, and, considerate, beginning, in, the, 1970s, paul, costa, and, robert, mccrae, began, researching, the, development, of, personality, assessments, based, on, factor, models, beginning, with, cluster, analyses, of, cattell, s, 16pf, costa, and, mccrae, initially, settled, on, a, three, factor, model, of, personality, these, three, factors, were, neuroticism, vs, emotional, stability, extraversion, vs, introversion, and, openness, vs, closedness, to, experience, resulting, in, the, acronym, neo, due, to, similarities, between, their, three, factor, neo, personality, inventory, and, goldberg, s, big, five, costa, and, mccrae, began, to, develop, scales, to, assess, agreeableness, and, conscientiousness, in, the, early, 1980s, this, work, culminated, in, the, 1985, publication, of, the, first, neo, pi, manual, to, be, based, on, the, full, five, factor, model, although, this, marked, the, introduction, of, agreeableness, to, the, neo, pi, costa, and, mccrae, worked, for, an, additional, seven, years, to, identify, and, elaborate, on, the, facets, comprising, this, factor, in, the, revised, neo, personality, inventory, in, the, neo, pi, each, of, the, five, factors, identified, by, costa, and, mccrae, are, identified, with, six, lower, level, traits, known, as, facets, the, lower, level, traits, subsumed, by, agreeableness, were, first, introduced, with, the, 1992, publication, of, the, revised, version, of, the, neo, pi, based, on, the, modern, neo, pi, r, the, six, facets, of, agreeableness, are, trust, straightforwardness, altruism, compliance, modesty, and, tender, mindedness, trust, is, viewed, to, be, an, important, feature, of, psychosocial, development, personality, theory, and, folk, psychological, conceptions, of, personality, individuals, who, score, high, on, trust, generally, believe, others, intentions, to, be, benevolent, and, can, be, naive, if, taken, to, the, extreme, those, scoring, low, on, this, facet, tend, to, be, cynical, and, paranoid, and, view, others, as, suspicious, dishonest, or, dangerous, straightforwardness, is, the, quality, of, being, direct, open, and, honest, in, communicating, with, others, despite, a, long, history, in, moral, philosophy, straightforwardness, is, not, as, vital, to, personality, theory, as, the, other, facets, of, agreeableness, those, scoring, high, on, straightforwardness, tend, to, interact, with, others, in, a, direct, and, honest, manner, low, scorers, are, less, direct, tend, to, be, high, in, self, monitoring, are, more, reticent, those, who, score, low, on, this, facet, also, tend, to, be, high, in, machiavellianism, being, deceitful, or, manipulative, with, others, straightforwardness, is, similar, to, a, dimension, in, the, interpersonal, circumplex, called, ingenuous, versus, calculating, according, to, michael, c, ashton, and, kibeom, lee, straightforwardness, is, similar, to, the, honesty, aspect, of, honesty, humility, in, the, hexaco, model, similar, to, altruism, in, animals, and, ethical, altruism, this, facet, is, defined, by, measures, of, selflessness, self, sacrifice, generosity, and, consideration, courtesy, and, concern, for, others, altruism, is, similar, to, alfred, adler, s, concept, of, social, interest, which, is, a, tendency, to, direct, one, s, actions, toward, the, betterment, of, society, individuals, who, score, low, on, altruism, tend, to, be, discourteous, selfish, or, greedy, a, pattern, of, behaviors, known, as, self, interest, in, adlerian, psychology, as, a, facet, of, agreeableness, compliance, is, defined, as, an, individual, s, typical, response, to, conflict, those, who, score, high, on, compliance, tend, to, be, meek, and, mild, and, to, prefer, cooperation, or, deference, as, a, means, of, resolving, conflict, low, scorers, tend, to, be, aggressive, antagonistic, competitive, quarrelsome, and, vindictive, while, trust, straightforwardness, altruism, and, compliance, all, refer, to, interpersonal, or, social, behaviors, modesty, refers, to, an, individual, s, self, concept, those, who, score, high, on, modesty, tend, to, be, humble, and, other, focused, while, low, scorers, tend, to, be, arrogant, ostentatious, and, self, aggrandizing, low, modesty, is, otherwise, known, as, conceitedness, or, narcissism, and, in, extreme, cases, can, manifest, as, narcissistic, personality, disorder, or, histrionic, personality, disorder, otherwise, known, as, humility, in, the, revised, neo, personality, inventory, modesty, resembles, the, humility, aspect, of, honesty, humility, in, the, hexaco, model, tender, mindedness, is, defined, as, the, extent, to, which, an, individual, s, judgments, and, attitudes, are, determined, by, emotion, coined, by, william, james, this, term, was, also, prominent, in, early, versions, of, the, 16pf, tender, mindedness, is, primarily, defined, by, sympathy, and, corresponds, to, the, international, personality, item, pool, s, sympathy, scale, in, contrast, tough, minded, is, a, trait, associated, with, psychoticism, on, the, eysenck, personality, questionnaire, models, based, on, psychobiological, theories, of, personality, have, each, incorporated, a, factor, similar, to, agreeableness, in, cloninger, s, temperament, and, character, inventory, the, character, trait, known, as, cooperativeness, is, very, similar, to, and, positively, correlated, with, agreeableness, in, zuckerman, s, alternative, five, model, of, personality, the, trait, known, as, aggression, hostility, is, inversely, related, to, agreeableness, to, address, the, absence, of, measures, of, dark, triad, traits, i, e, narcissism, machiavellianism, and, psychopathy, michael, ashton, and, kibeom, lee, proposed, the, addition, of, a, sixth, factor, to, the, five, factor, model, validated, with, psycholexical, studies, similar, to, those, used, in, the, development, of, the, five, factor, model, the, hexaco, model, adds, honesty, humility, to, five, factors, resembling, those, in, the, neo, pi, although, honesty, humility, does, not, directly, correspond, to, any, big, five, trait, it, is, strongly, correlated, with, the, straightforwardness, and, modesty, facets, of, big, five, agreeableness, as, both, of, these, facets, are, only, weakly, correlated, with, big, five, agreeableness, ashton, and, lee, suggest, dividing, neo, pi, agreeableness, into, two, factors, similar, to, those, in, the, hexaco, model, honesty, humility, i, e, straightforwardness, and, modesty, and, a, redefined, agreeableness, trust, altruism, compliance, and, tender, mindedness, reflecting, this, conception, of, honesty, humility, and, hexaco, agreeableness, as, unique, though, similar, concepts, ashton, and, lee, propose, that, they, represent, different, aspects, of, reciprocal, altruism, fairness, honesty, humility, and, tolerance, agreeableness, despite, suggesting, this, reconceptualization, of, agreeableness, for, the, neo, pi, ashton, and, lee, do, not, believe, hexaco, agreeableness, is, accurately, captured, by, trust, altruism, compliance, and, tender, mindedness, in, addition, to, accounting, for, these, four, facets, of, big, five, agreeableness, the, hexaco, model, s, construction, of, agreeableness, includes, content, categorized, under, neuroticism, in, the, neo, pi, i, e, temperamentalness, and, irritability, to, reflect, the, negative, emotional, content, at, the, low, end, of, hexaco, agreeableness, this, factor, is, also, referred, to, as, agreeableness, versus, anger, the, inclusion, of, anger, in, the, definition, of, hexaco, agreeableness, further, helps, to, differentiate, this, factor, from, honesty, humility, in, response, to, offensive, or, transgressive, actions, individuals, who, score, low, on, honesty, humility, tend, not, to, respond, immediately, instead, they, defer, their, response, by, planning, their, revenge, and, waiting, for, the, perfect, opportunity, to, enact, it, although, those, who, score, low, on, hexaco, agreeableness, also, employ, this, premeditated, strategy, they, also, tend, to, respond, immediately, with, anger, to, help, capture, the, numerous, distinctions, between, the, big, five, and, hexaco, models, ashton, and, lee, propose, four, new, facet, labels, in, their, conceptualization, of, agreeableness, forgiveness, gentleness, flexibility, and, patience, in, addition, to, these, four, agreeableness, specific, facets, lee, and, ashton, have, proposed, an, additional, interstitial, facet, located, in, a, space, shared, by, agreeableness, honesty, humility, and, emotionality, altruism, versus, antagonism, agreeableness, is, an, asset, in, situations, that, require, getting, along, with, others, compared, to, disagreeable, persons, agreeable, individuals, display, a, tendency, to, perceive, others, in, a, more, positive, light, because, agreeable, children, are, more, sensitive, to, the, needs, and, perspectives, of, others, they, are, less, likely, to, suffer, from, social, rejection, children, who, are, less, disruptive, less, aggressive, and, more, skilled, at, entering, play, groups, are, more, likely, to, gain, acceptance, by, their, peers, one, study, found, that, people, high, in, agreeableness, are, more, emotionally, responsive, in, social, situations, this, effect, was, measured, on, both, self, report, questionnaires, and, physiological, measures, and, offers, evidence, that, extraversion, and, neuroticism, are, not, the, only, big, five, personality, factors, that, influence, emotion, the, effect, was, especially, pronounced, among, women, research, also, shows, that, people, high, in, agreeableness, are, more, likely, to, control, negative, emotions, like, anger, in, conflict, situations, those, who, are, high, in, agreeableness, are, more, likely, to, use, conflict, avoidant, tactics, when, in, conflict, with, others, whereas, people, low, in, agreeableness, are, more, likely, to, use, coercive, tactics, like, stonewalling, or, shunning, they, are, also, more, willing, to, give, ground, to, their, adversary, and, may, lose, arguments, with, people, who, are, less, agreeable, from, their, perspective, they, have, not, really, lost, an, argument, as, much, as, maintained, a, congenial, relationship, with, another, person, agreeableness, is, positively, associated, with, altruism, and, helping, behaviour, across, situations, people, who, are, high, in, agreeableness, are, more, likely, to, report, an, interest, and, involvement, with, helping, others, experiments, have, shown, that, most, people, are, likely, to, help, their, own, kin, and, to, help, when, empathy, has, been, aroused, agreeable, people, are, likely, to, help, even, when, these, conditions, are, not, present, in, other, words, agreeable, people, appear, to, be, traited, for, helping, and, do, not, need, any, other, motivations, while, agreeable, individuals, are, habitually, likely, to, help, others, disagreeable, people, may, be, more, likely, to, cause, harm, researchers, have, found, that, low, levels, of, agreeableness, are, associated, with, hostile, thoughts, and, aggression, in, adolescents, as, well, as, poor, social, adjustment, people, low, in, agreeableness, are, also, more, likely, to, be, prejudiced, against, stigmatized, groups, such, as, the, overweight, in, combination, with, mental, illness, low, agreeableness, may, be, associated, with, narcissistic, and, anti, social, tendencies, in, theory, individuals, who, are, extremely, high, in, agreeableness, are, at, risk, for, problems, of, dependency, empirical, studies, show, that, many, more, problems, are, associated, with, low, agreeableness, however, high, agreeableness, does, not, always, lead, to, prosocial, behaviour, in, a, milgram, experiment, conscientious, and, agreeable, people, when, advised, by, an, ill, intending, authority, are, more, willing, to, administer, high, intensity, electric, shocks, to, a, victim, because, conscientious, and, agreeable, people, are, less, capable, of, resistance, agreeableness, and, its, related, traits, have, generally, been, assumed, to, be, uncorrelated, with, cognitive, abilities, in, general, it, does, have, the, fewest, and, smallest, connections, with, intelligence, however, large, scale, meta, analyses, have, revealed, that, the, aspects, of, agreeableness, i, e, compassion, and, politeness, have, meaningful, and, opposite, relations, with, cognitive, abilities, for, example, compassion, correlates, 26, with, general, mental, ability, whereas, politeness, correlates, 22, with, general, science, knowledge, facets, of, agreeableness, also, demonstrate, some, meaningful, connections, with, various, cognitive, abilities, e, g, cooperation, and, processing, speed, correlate, 20, modesty, and, ideational, fluency, correlate, 17, agreeableness, is, important, to, psychological, well, being, predicting, mental, health, positive, affect, and, good, relations, with, others, in, both, childhood, and, adolescence, agreeableness, along, with, this, it, has, also, been, implicated, to, conflict, management, skills, school, adjustment, peer, social, status, and, self, esteem, among, young, adults, individuals, that, have, been, diagnosed, with, externalizing, as, well, as, internalizing, disorders, present, lower, levels, of, agreeableness, and, communion, and, higher, levels, of, negative, emotionality, than, those, young, adults, without, such, disorders, agreeableness, also, is, reported, anger, and, depression, in, young, adults, among, college, students, agreeableness, is, often, associated, with, self, reports, of, emotional, experience, and, control, along, with, psycho, physiological, responses, to, affectively, charged, stimuli, across, adulthood, low, agreeableness, has, been, found, to, be, a, health, risk, high, agreeableness, especially, trust, and, honesty, has, been, linked, to, longevity, a, study, done, by, caspi, elder, and, bem, 1987, found, that, explosive, and, ill, tempered, children, had, higher, rates, of, divorce, as, adults, when, compared, with, their, even, tempered, peers, further, ill, tempered, men, had, lower, educational, attainment, occupational, status, and, work, stability, and, ill, tempered, women, married, men, with, similar, low, achievement, profiles, a, second, and, more, recent, study, by, shiner, 2000, found, that, composite, variables, describing, middle, childhood, agreeableness, and, friendly, compliance, predicted, adolescent, academic, performance, behavioral, conduct, and, social, competence, ten, years, later, in, the, united, states, people, in, the, west, midwest, and, south, tend, to, have, higher, average, scores, on, agreeableness, than, people, living, in, other, regions, according, to, researchers, the, top, ten, most, agreeable, states, are, north, dakota, minnesota, mississippi, utah, wisconsin, tennessee, north, carolina, georgia, oklahoma, and, nebraska, these, findings, are, consistent, with, well, known, expressions, in, these, states, such, as, southern, hospitality, and, minnesota, nice, because, these, states, are, generally, less, urbanized, than, the, east, and, west, coasts, people, may, be, more, likely, to, live, in, small, communities, and, know, their, neighbors, consequently, they, may, be, more, willing, to, care, about, and, help, their, neighbours, in, a, study, done, by, albright, et, al, 1997, groups, of, college, students, from, china, and, the, united, states, rated, strangers, from, both, countries, on, the, big, five, personality, traits, external, traits, and, how, well, they, were, dressed, they, found, that, both, chinese, and, u, s, students, rated, faces, as, showing, similar, levels, of, agreeableness, and, extroversion, the, people, who, were, thought, to, be, the, most, agreeable, wore, smiles, a, facial, expression, that, is, recognized, around, the, world, the, findings, seem, to, suggest, that, the, trait, of, agreeableness, is, attributed, to, people, in, a, universal, way
