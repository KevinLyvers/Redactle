jealousy, generally, refers, to, the, thoughts, or, feelings, of, insecurity, fear, and, concern, over, a, relative, lack, of, possessions, or, safety, jealousy, can, consist, of, one, or, more, emotions, such, as, anger, resentment, inadequacy, helplessness, or, disgust, in, its, original, meaning, jealousy, is, distinct, from, envy, though, the, two, terms, have, popularly, become, synonymous, in, the, english, language, with, jealousy, now, also, taking, on, the, definition, originally, used, for, envy, alone, these, two, emotions, are, often, confused, with, each, other, since, they, tend, to, appear, in, the, same, situation, jealousy, is, a, typical, experience, in, human, relationships, and, it, has, been, observed, in, infants, as, young, as, five, months, some, researchers, claim, that, jealousy, is, seen, in, all, cultures, and, is, a, universal, trait, however, others, claim, jealousy, is, a, culture, specific, emotion, jealousy, can, either, be, suspicious, or, reactive, and, it, is, often, reinforced, as, a, series, of, particularly, strong, emotions, and, constructed, as, a, universal, human, experience, psychologists, have, proposed, several, models, to, study, the, processes, underlying, jealousy, and, have, identified, factors, that, result, in, jealousy, sociologists, have, demonstrated, that, cultural, beliefs, and, values, play, an, important, role, in, determining, what, triggers, jealousy, and, what, constitutes, socially, acceptable, expressions, of, jealousy, biologists, have, identified, factors, that, may, unconsciously, influence, the, expression, of, jealousy, throughout, history, artists, have, also, explored, the, theme, of, jealousy, in, paintings, films, songs, plays, poems, and, books, and, theologians, have, offered, religious, views, of, jealousy, based, on, the, scriptures, of, their, respective, faiths, the, word, stems, from, the, french, jalousie, formed, from, jaloux, jealous, and, further, from, low, latin, zelosus, full, of, zeal, in, turn, from, the, greek, word, z, los, sometimes, jealousy, but, more, often, in, a, positive, sense, emulation, ardour, zeal, with, a, root, connoting, to, boil, ferment, or, yeast, the, biblical, language, zeal, would, be, known, as, tolerating, no, unfaithfulness, while, in, middle, english, zealous, is, good, one, origin, word, gelus, meant, possessive, and, suspicious, the, word, then, turned, into, jelus, since, william, shakespeare, s, use, of, terms, like, green, eyed, monster, the, color, green, has, been, associated, with, jealousy, and, envy, from, which, the, expression, green, with, envy, is, derived, people, do, not, express, jealousy, through, a, single, emotion, or, a, single, behavior, they, instead, express, jealousy, through, diverse, emotions, and, behaviors, which, makes, it, difficult, to, form, a, scientific, definition, of, jealousy, scientists, instead, define, it, in, their, own, words, as, illustrated, by, the, following, examples, these, definitions, of, jealousy, share, two, basic, themes, first, all, the, definitions, imply, a, triad, composed, of, a, jealous, individual, a, partner, and, a, perception, of, a, third, party, or, rival, second, all, the, definitions, describe, jealousy, as, a, reaction, to, a, perceived, threat, to, the, relationship, between, two, people, or, a, dyad, jealous, reactions, typically, involve, aversive, emotions, and, or, behaviors, that, are, assumed, to, be, protective, for, their, attachment, relationships, these, themes, form, the, essential, meaning, of, jealousy, in, most, scientific, studies, popular, culture, uses, the, word, jealousy, as, a, synonym, for, envy, many, dictionary, definitions, include, a, reference, to, envy, or, envious, feelings, in, fact, the, overlapping, use, of, jealousy, and, envy, has, a, long, history, the, terms, are, used, indiscriminately, in, such, popular, feel, good, books, as, nancy, friday, s, jealousy, where, the, expression, jealousy, applies, to, a, broad, range, of, passions, from, envy, to, lust, and, greed, while, this, kind, of, usage, blurs, the, boundaries, between, categories, that, are, intellectually, valuable, and, psychologically, justifiable, such, confusion, is, understandable, in, that, historical, explorations, of, the, term, indicate, that, these, boundaries, have, long, posed, problems, margot, grzywacz, s, fascinating, etymological, survey, of, the, word, in, romance, and, germanic, languages, asserts, indeed, that, the, concept, was, one, of, those, that, proved, to, be, the, most, difficult, to, express, in, language, and, was, therefore, among, the, last, to, find, an, unambiguous, term, classical, latin, used, invidia, without, strictly, differentiating, between, envy, and, jealousy, it, was, not, until, the, postclassical, era, that, latin, borrowed, the, late, and, poetic, greek, word, zelotypia, and, the, associated, adjective, zelosus, it, is, from, this, adjective, that, are, derived, french, jaloux, proven, al, gelos, italian, geloso, spanish, celoso, and, portuguese, cioso, perhaps, the, overlapping, use, of, jealousy, and, envy, occurs, because, people, can, experience, both, at, the, same, time, a, person, may, envy, the, characteristics, or, possessions, of, someone, who, also, happens, to, be, a, romantic, rival, in, fact, one, may, even, interpret, romantic, jealousy, as, a, form, of, envy, a, jealous, person, may, envy, the, affection, that, their, partner, gives, to, a, rival, affection, the, jealous, person, feels, entitled, to, himself, or, herself, people, often, use, the, word, jealousy, as, a, broad, label, that, applies, to, both, experiences, of, jealousy, and, experiences, of, envy, although, popular, culture, often, uses, jealousy, and, envy, as, synonyms, modern, philosophers, and, psychologists, have, argued, for, conceptual, distinctions, between, jealousy, and, envy, for, example, philosopher, john, rawls, distinguishes, between, jealousy, and, envy, on, the, ground, that, jealousy, involves, the, wish, to, keep, what, one, has, and, envy, the, wish, to, get, what, one, does, not, have, thus, a, child, is, jealous, of, her, parents, attention, to, a, sibling, but, envious, of, her, friend, s, new, bicycle, psychologists, laura, guerrero, and, peter, andersen, have, proposed, the, same, distinction, they, claim, the, jealous, person, perceives, that, he, or, she, possesses, a, valued, relationship, but, is, in, danger, of, losing, it, or, at, least, of, having, it, altered, in, an, undesirable, manner, whereas, the, envious, person, does, not, possess, a, valued, commodity, but, wishes, to, possess, it, gerrod, parrott, draws, attention, to, the, distinct, thoughts, and, feelings, that, occur, in, jealousy, and, envy, the, common, experience, of, jealousy, for, many, people, may, involve, the, experience, of, envy, involves, parrott, acknowledges, that, people, can, experience, envy, and, jealousy, at, the, same, time, feelings, of, envy, about, a, rival, can, even, intensify, the, experience, of, jealousy, still, the, differences, between, envy, and, jealousy, in, terms, of, thoughts, and, feelings, justify, their, distinction, in, philosophy, and, science, jealousy, involves, an, entire, emotional, episode, including, a, complex, narrative, this, includes, the, circumstances, that, lead, up, to, jealousy, jealousy, itself, as, emotion, any, attempt, at, self, regulation, subsequent, actions, and, events, and, ultimately, the, resolution, of, the, episode, the, narrative, can, originate, from, experienced, facts, thoughts, perceptions, memories, but, also, imagination, guesses, and, assumptions, the, more, society, and, culture, matter, in, the, formation, of, these, factors, the, more, jealousy, can, have, a, social, and, cultural, origin, by, contrast, jealousy, can, be, a, cognitively, impenetrable, state, where, education, and, rational, belief, matter, very, little, one, possible, explanation, of, the, origin, of, jealousy, in, evolutionary, psychology, is, that, the, emotion, evolved, in, order, to, maximize, the, success, of, our, genes, it, is, a, biologically, based, emotion, selected, to, foster, the, certainty, about, the, paternity, of, one, s, own, offspring, a, jealous, behavior, in, women, is, directed, into, avoiding, sexual, betrayal, and, a, consequent, waste, of, resources, and, effort, in, taking, care, of, someone, else, s, offspring, there, are, additionally, cultural, or, social, explanations, of, the, origin, of, jealousy, according, to, one, the, narrative, from, which, jealousy, arises, can, be, in, great, part, made, by, the, imagination, imagination, is, strongly, affected, by, a, person, s, cultural, milieu, the, pattern, of, reasoning, the, way, one, perceives, situations, depends, strongly, on, cultural, context, it, has, elsewhere, been, suggested, that, jealousy, is, in, fact, a, secondary, emotion, in, reaction, to, one, s, needs, not, being, met, be, those, needs, for, attachment, attention, reassurance, or, any, other, form, of, care, that, would, be, otherwise, expected, to, arise, from, that, primary, romantic, relationship, while, mainstream, psychology, considers, sexual, arousal, through, jealousy, a, paraphilia, some, authors, on, sexuality, have, argued, that, jealousy, in, manageable, dimensions, can, have, a, definite, positive, effect, on, sexual, function, and, sexual, satisfaction, studies, have, also, shown, that, jealousy, sometimes, heightens, passion, towards, partners, and, increases, the, intensity, of, passionate, sex, jealousy, in, children, and, teenagers, has, been, observed, more, often, in, those, with, low, self, esteem, and, can, evoke, aggressive, reactions, one, such, study, suggested, that, developing, intimate, friends, can, be, followed, by, emotional, insecurity, and, loneliness, in, some, children, when, those, intimate, friends, interact, with, others, jealousy, is, linked, to, aggression, and, low, self, esteem, research, by, sybil, hart, phd, at, texas, tech, university, indicates, that, children, are, capable, of, feeling, and, displaying, jealousy, at, as, young, as, six, months, infants, showed, signs, of, distress, when, their, mothers, focused, their, attention, on, a, lifelike, doll, this, research, could, explain, why, children, and, infants, show, distress, when, a, sibling, is, born, creating, the, foundation, for, sibling, rivalry, in, addition, to, traditional, jealousy, comes, obsessive, jealousy, which, can, be, a, form, of, obsessive, compulsive, disorder, this, jealousy, is, characterized, by, obsessional, jealousy, and, thoughts, of, the, partner, anthropologists, have, claimed, that, jealousy, varies, across, cultures, cultural, learning, can, influence, the, situations, that, trigger, jealousy, and, the, manner, in, which, jealousy, is, expressed, attitudes, toward, jealousy, can, also, change, within, a, culture, over, time, for, example, attitudes, toward, jealousy, changed, substantially, during, the, 1960s, and, 1970s, in, the, united, states, people, in, the, united, states, adopted, much, more, negative, views, about, jealousy, as, men, and, women, became, more, equal, it, became, less, appropriate, or, acceptable, to, express, jealousy, romantic, jealousy, arises, as, a, result, of, romantic, interest, it, is, defined, as, a, complex, of, thoughts, feelings, and, actions, that, follow, threats, to, self, esteem, and, or, threats, to, the, existence, or, quality, of, the, relationship, when, those, threats, are, generated, by, the, perception, of, a, real, or, potential, romantic, attraction, between, one, s, partner, and, a, perhaps, imaginary, rival, different, from, sexual, jealousy, romantic, jealousy, is, triggered, by, threats, to, self, and, relationship, rather, than, sexual, interest, in, another, person, factors, such, as, feelings, of, inadequacy, as, a, partner, sexual, exclusivity, and, having, put, relatively, more, effort, into, the, relationship, are, positively, correlated, to, relationship, jealousy, in, both, genders, as, romantic, jealousy, is, a, complicated, reaction, that, has, multiple, components, i, e, thoughts, feelings, and, actions, one, aspect, of, romantic, jealousy, that, is, under, study, is, communicative, responses, communicative, responses, serve, three, critical, functions, in, a, romantic, relationship, i, e, reducing, uncertainty, maintaining, or, repairing, relationship, and, restoring, self, esteem, if, done, properly, communicative, responses, can, lead, to, more, satisfying, relationships, after, experiencing, romantic, jealousy, there, are, two, subsets, of, communicative, responses, interactive, responses, and, general, behavior, responses, interactive, responses, is, face, to, face, and, partner, directed, while, general, behavior, responses, may, not, occur, interactively, guerrero, and, colleagues, further, categorize, multiple, types, of, communicative, responses, of, romantic, jealousy, interactive, responses, can, be, broken, down, to, six, types, falling, in, different, places, on, continua, of, threat, and, directness, guerrero, and, colleagues, have, also, proposed, five, general, behavior, responses, the, five, sub, types, differ, in, whether, a, response, is, 1, directed, at, partner, or, rival, s, 2, directed, at, discovery, or, repair, and, 3, positively, or, negatively, valenced, while, some, of, these, communicative, responses, are, destructive, and, aggressive, e, g, distributive, communication, and, active, distancing, some, individuals, respond, to, jealousy, in, a, more, constructive, way, integrative, communication, compensatory, restoration, and, negative, affect, expression, have, been, shown, to, lead, to, positive, relation, outcomes, one, factor, that, affects, the, type, of, communicative, responses, elicited, in, an, individual, is, emotions, jealousy, anger, is, associated, with, more, aggressive, communicative, response, while, irritation, tends, to, lead, to, more, constructive, communicative, behaviors, researchers, also, believe, that, when, jealousy, is, experienced, it, can, be, caused, by, differences, in, understanding, the, commitment, level, of, the, couple, rather, than, directly, being, caused, by, biology, alone, the, research, identified, that, if, a, person, valued, long, term, relationships, more, than, being, sexually, exclusive, those, individuals, were, more, likely, to, demonstrate, jealousy, over, emotional, rather, than, physical, infidelity, through, a, study, conducted, in, three, spanish, speaking, countries, it, was, determined, that, facebook, jealousy, also, exists, this, facebook, jealousy, ultimately, leads, to, increased, relationship, jealousy, and, study, participants, also, displayed, decreased, self, esteem, as, a, result, of, the, facebook, jealousy, sexual, jealousy, may, be, triggered, when, a, person, s, partner, displays, sexual, interest, in, another, person, the, feeling, of, jealousy, may, be, just, as, powerful, if, one, partner, suspects, the, other, is, guilty, of, infidelity, fearing, that, their, partner, will, experience, sexual, jealousy, the, person, who, has, been, unfaithful, may, lie, about, their, actions, in, order, to, protect, their, partner, experts, often, believe, that, sexual, jealousy, is, in, fact, a, biological, imperative, it, may, be, part, of, a, mechanism, by, which, humans, and, other, animals, ensure, access, to, the, best, reproductive, partners, it, seems, that, male, jealousy, in, heterosexual, relationships, may, be, influenced, by, their, female, partner, s, phase, in, her, menstrual, cycle, in, the, period, around, and, shortly, before, ovulation, males, are, found, to, display, more, mate, retention, tactics, which, are, linked, to, jealousy, furthermore, a, male, is, more, likely, to, employ, mate, retention, tactics, if, their, partner, shows, more, interest, in, other, males, which, is, more, likely, to, occur, in, the, pre, ovulation, phase, according, to, rebecca, l, ammon, in, the, osprey, journal, of, ideas, and, inquiry, at, unf, digital, commons, 2004, the, parental, investment, model, based, on, parental, investment, theory, posits, that, more, men, than, women, ratify, sex, differences, in, jealousy, in, addition, more, women, over, men, consider, emotional, infidelity, fear, of, abandonment, as, more, distressing, than, sexual, infidelity, according, to, the, attachment, theory, sex, and, attachment, style, makes, significant, and, unique, interactive, contributions, to, the, distress, experienced, security, within, the, relationship, also, heavily, contributes, to, one, s, level, of, distress, these, findings, imply, that, psychological, and, cultural, mechanisms, regarding, sex, differences, may, play, a, larger, role, than, expected, the, attachment, theory, also, claims, to, reveal, how, infants, attachment, patterns, are, the, basis, for, self, report, measures, of, adult, attachment, although, there, are, no, sex, differences, in, childhood, attachment, individuals, with, dismissing, behavior, were, more, concerned, with, the, sexual, aspect, of, relationships, as, a, coping, mechanism, these, individuals, would, report, sexual, infidelity, as, more, harmful, moreover, research, shows, that, audit, attachment, styles, strongly, conclude, with, the, type, of, infidelity, that, occurred, thus, psychological, and, cultural, mechanisms, are, implied, as, unvarying, differences, in, jealousy, that, play, a, role, in, sexual, attachment, in, 1906, the, american, journal, of, psychology, had, reported, that, the, weight, of, quotable, male, authority, is, to, the, effect, that, women, are, more, susceptible, to, jealousy, this, claim, was, accompanied, in, the, journal, by, a, quote, from, confucius, the, five, worst, maladies, that, afflict, the, female, mind, are, indocility, discontent, slander, jealousy, and, silliness, emotional, jealousy, was, predicted, to, be, nine, times, more, responsive, in, females, than, in, males, the, emotional, jealousy, predicted, in, females, also, held, turn, to, state, that, females, experiencing, emotional, jealousy, are, more, violent, than, men, experiencing, emotional, jealousy, there, are, distinct, emotional, responses, to, gender, differences, in, romantic, relationships, for, example, due, to, paternity, uncertainty, in, males, jealousy, increases, in, males, over, sexual, infidelity, rather, than, emotional, according, to, research, more, women, are, likely, to, be, upset, by, signs, of, resource, withdraw, i, e, another, female, than, by, sexual, infidelity, a, large, amount, of, data, supports, this, notion, however, one, must, consider, for, jealousy, the, life, stage, or, experience, one, encounters, in, reference, to, the, diverse, responses, to, infidelity, available, research, states, that, a, componential, view, of, jealousy, consist, of, specific, set, of, emotions, that, serve, the, reproductive, role, however, research, shows, that, both, men, and, women, would, be, equally, angry, and, point, the, blame, for, sexual, infidelity, but, women, would, be, more, hurt, by, emotional, infidelity, despite, this, fact, anger, surfaces, when, both, parties, involved, are, responsible, for, some, type, of, uncontrollable, behavior, sexual, conduct, is, not, exempt, some, behavior, and, actions, are, controllable, such, as, sexual, behavior, however, hurt, feelings, are, activated, by, relationship, deviation, no, evidence, is, known, to, be, sexually, dimorphic, in, both, college, and, adult, convenience, samples, the, jealousy, specific, innate, model, jsim, proved, to, not, be, innate, but, may, be, sensitive, to, situational, factors, as, a, result, it, may, only, activate, at, stages, for, example, it, was, predicted, that, male, jealousy, decreases, as, females, reproductive, values, decreases, a, second, possibility, that, the, jsim, effect, is, not, innate, but, is, cultural, differences, have, been, highlighted, in, socio, economic, status, specific, such, as, the, divide, between, high, school, and, collegiate, individuals, moreover, individuals, of, both, genders, were, angrier, and, blamed, their, partners, more, for, sexual, infidelities, but, were, more, hurt, by, emotional, infidelity, jealousy, is, composed, of, lower, level, emotional, states, e, g, anger, and, hurt, which, may, be, triggered, by, a, variety, of, events, not, by, differences, in, individuals, life, stage, although, research, has, recognized, the, importance, of, early, childhood, experiences, for, the, development, of, competence, in, intimate, relationships, early, family, environment, is, recently, being, examined, as, we, age, research, on, self, esteem, and, attachment, theory, suggest, that, individuals, internalize, early, experiences, within, the, family, which, subconsciously, translates, into, their, personal, view, of, worth, of, themselves, and, the, value, of, being, close, to, other, individuals, especially, in, an, interpersonal, relationship, a, study, by, researchers, at, the, university, of, california, san, diego, replicated, jealousy, studies, done, on, humans, on, canines, they, reported, in, a, paper, published, in, plos, one, in, 2014, that, a, significant, number, of, dogs, exhibited, jealous, behaviors, when, their, human, companions, paid, attention, to, dog, like, toys, compared, to, when, their, human, companions, paid, attention, to, non, social, objects, in, addition, jealousy, has, been, speculated, to, be, a, potential, factor, in, incidences, of, aggression, or, emotional, tension, in, dogs, mellissa, starling, an, animal, behavior, consultant, of, the, university, of, sydney, noted, that, dogs, are, social, animals, and, they, obey, a, group, hierarchy, changes, in, the, home, like, the, arrival, of, a, baby, can, prompt, a, family, pet, to, behave, differently, to, what, one, might, expect, artistic, depictions, of, jealousy, occur, in, fiction, films, and, other, art, forms, such, as, painting, and, sculpture, jealousy, is, a, common, theme, in, literature, art, theatre, and, film, often, it, is, presented, as, a, demonstration, of, particularly, deep, feelings, of, love, rather, than, a, destructive, obsession, a, study, done, by, ferris, smith, greenberg, and, smith, looked, into, the, way, people, saw, dating, and, romantic, relationships, based, on, how, many, reality, dating, shows, they, watched, people, who, spent, a, large, amount, of, time, watching, these, reality, dating, shows, endorsed, or, supported, the, dating, attitudes, that, would, be, shown, on, the, show, while, the, other, people, who, do, not, spend, time, watching, reality, dating, shows, did, not, mirror, the, same, ideas, this, means, if, someone, watches, a, reality, dating, show, that, displays, men, and, women, reacting, violently, or, aggressively, towards, their, partner, due, to, jealousy, they, can, mirror, that, this, is, reflected, in, romantic, movies, as, well, jessica, r, frampton, conducted, a, study, looking, into, romantic, jealousy, in, movies, the, study, found, that, there, were, 230, instances, of, romantic, jealousy, were, identified, in, the, 51, top, grossing, romantic, comedies, from, 2002, 2014, some, of, the, films, did, not, display, romantic, jealousy, however, some, featured, many, examples, of, romantic, jealousy, this, was, due, to, the, fact, that, some, of, the, top, grossing, movies, did, not, contain, a, rival, or, romantic, competition, while, others, such, as, forgetting, sarah, marshall, was, said, to, contain, 19, instances, of, romantic, jealousy, out, of, the, 230, instances, 58, were, reactive, jealousy, while, 31, showed, possessive, jealousy, the, last, 11, displayed, anxious, jealousy, it, was, seen, the, least, in, all, 230, cases, out, of, the, 361, reactions, to, the, jealousy, found, 53, were, found, to, be, destructive, responses, only, 19, of, responses, were, constructive, while, 10, showed, avoidant, responses, the, last, 18, were, considered, rival, focused, responses, which, lead, to, the, finding, that, there, was, a, higher, than, expected, number, of, rival, focused, responses, to, possessive, jealousy, jealousy, in, religion, examines, how, the, scriptures, and, teachings, of, various, religions, deal, with, the, topic, of, jealousy, religions, may, be, compared, and, contrasted, on, how, they, deal, with, two, issues, concepts, of, divine, jealousy, and, rules, about, the, provocation, and, expression, of, human, jealousy, a, study, was, done, in, order, to, cross, examine, jealousy, among, four, different, cultures, ireland, thailand, india, and, the, united, states, these, cultures, were, chosen, to, demonstrate, differences, in, expression, across, cultures, the, study, posits, that, male, dominant, cultures, are, more, likely, to, express, and, reveal, jealousy, the, survey, found, that, thais, are, less, likely, to, express, jealousy, than, the, other, three, cultures, this, is, because, the, men, in, these, cultures, are, rewarded, in, a, way, for, showing, jealousy, due, to, the, fact, that, some, women, interpret, it, as, love, this, can, also, be, seen, when, watching, romantic, comedies, when, males, show, they, are, jealous, of, a, rival, or, emotionally, jealous, women, perceive, it, as, men, caring, more
