europe, the, iranian, plateau, and, the, northern, indian, subcontinent, some, european, languages, of, this, family, english, french, portuguese, russian, dutch, and, spanish, have, expanded, through, colonialism, in, the, modern, period, and, are, now, spoken, across, several, continents, the, indo, european, family, is, divided, into, several, branches, or, sub, families, of, which, there, are, eight, groups, with, languages, still, alive, today, albanian, armenian, balto, slavic, celtic, germanic, hellenic, indo, iranian, and, italic, another, nine, subdivisions, are, now, extinct, today, the, individual, indo, european, languages, with, the, most, native, speakers, are, english, spanish, portuguese, russian, hindustani, bengali, punjabi, french, and, german, each, with, over, 100, million, native, speakers, many, others, are, small, and, in, danger, of, extinction, in, total, 46, of, the, world, s, population, 3, 2, billion, people, speaks, an, indo, european, language, as, a, first, language, by, far, the, highest, of, any, language, family, there, are, about, 445, living, indo, european, languages, according, to, an, estimate, by, ethnologue, with, over, two, thirds, 313, of, them, belonging, to, the, indo, iranian, branch, all, indo, european, languages, are, descended, from, a, single, prehistoric, language, linguistically, reconstructed, as, proto, indo, european, spoken, sometime, during, the, neolithic, or, early, bronze, age, the, geographical, location, where, it, was, spoken, the, proto, indo, european, homeland, has, been, the, object, of, many, competing, hypotheses, the, academic, consensus, supports, the, kurgan, hypothesis, which, posits, the, homeland, to, be, the, pontic, caspian, steppe, in, what, is, now, ukraine, and, southern, russia, associated, with, the, yamnaya, culture, and, other, related, archaeological, cultures, during, the, 4th, millennium, bc, to, early, 3rd, millennium, bc, by, the, time, the, first, written, records, appeared, indo, european, had, already, evolved, into, numerous, languages, spoken, across, much, of, europe, south, asia, and, part, of, western, asia, written, evidence, of, indo, european, appeared, during, the, bronze, age, in, the, form, of, mycenaean, greek, and, the, anatolian, languages, of, hittite, and, luwian, the, oldest, records, are, isolated, hittite, words, and, names, interspersed, in, texts, that, are, otherwise, in, the, unrelated, akkadian, language, a, semitic, language, found, in, texts, of, the, assyrian, colony, of, k, ltepe, in, eastern, anatolia, dating, to, the, 20th, century, bc, although, no, older, written, records, of, the, original, proto, indo, european, population, remain, some, aspects, of, their, culture, and, their, religion, can, be, reconstructed, from, later, evidence, in, the, daughter, cultures, the, indo, european, family, is, significant, to, the, field, of, historical, linguistics, as, it, possesses, the, second, longest, recorded, history, of, any, known, family, after, the, afroasiatic, egyptian, language, and, semitic, languages, the, analysis, of, the, family, relationships, between, the, indo, european, languages, and, the, reconstruction, of, their, common, source, was, central, to, the, development, of, the, methodology, of, historical, linguistics, as, an, academic, discipline, in, the, 19th, century, the, indo, european, language, family, is, not, considered, by, the, current, academic, consensus, in, the, field, of, linguistics, to, have, any, genetic, relationships, with, other, language, families, although, several, disputed, hypotheses, propose, such, relations, during, the, 16th, century, european, visitors, to, the, indian, subcontinent, began, to, notice, similarities, among, indo, aryan, iranian, and, european, languages, in, 1583, english, jesuit, missionary, and, konkani, scholar, thomas, stephens, wrote, a, letter, from, goa, to, his, brother, not, published, until, the, 20th, century, in, which, he, noted, similarities, between, indian, languages, and, greek, and, latin, another, account, was, made, by, filippo, sassetti, a, merchant, born, in, florence, in, 1540, who, travelled, to, the, indian, subcontinent, writing, in, 1585, he, noted, some, word, similarities, between, sanskrit, and, italian, these, included, deva, dio, god, sarpa, serpe, serpent, sapta, sette, seven, a, a, otto, eight, and, nava, nove, nine, however, neither, stephens, nor, sassetti, s, observations, led, to, further, scholarly, inquiry, in, 1647, dutch, linguist, and, scholar, marcus, zuerius, van, boxhorn, noted, the, similarity, among, certain, asian, and, european, languages, and, theorized, that, they, were, derived, from, a, primitive, common, language, that, he, called, scythian, he, included, in, his, hypothesis, dutch, albanian, greek, latin, persian, and, german, later, adding, slavic, celtic, and, baltic, languages, however, van, boxhorn, s, suggestions, did, not, become, widely, known, and, did, not, stimulate, further, research, ottoman, turkish, traveler, evliya, elebi, visited, vienna, in, 1665, 1666, as, part, of, a, diplomatic, mission, and, noted, a, few, similarities, between, words, in, german, and, in, persian, gaston, coeurdoux, and, others, made, observations, of, the, same, type, coeurdoux, made, a, thorough, comparison, of, sanskrit, latin, and, greek, conjugations, in, the, late, 1760s, to, suggest, a, relationship, among, them, meanwhile, mikhail, lomonosov, compared, different, language, groups, including, slavic, baltic, kurlandic, iranian, medic, finnish, chinese, hottentot, khoekhoe, and, others, noting, that, related, languages, including, latin, greek, german, and, russian, must, have, separated, in, antiquity, from, common, ancestors, the, hypothesis, reappeared, in, 1786, when, sir, william, jones, first, lectured, on, the, striking, similarities, among, three, of, the, oldest, languages, known, in, his, time, latin, greek, and, sanskrit, to, which, he, tentatively, added, gothic, celtic, and, persian, though, his, classification, contained, some, inaccuracies, and, omissions, in, one, of, the, most, famous, quotations, in, linguistics, jones, made, the, following, prescient, statement, in, a, lecture, to, the, asiatic, society, of, bengal, in, 1786, conjecturing, the, existence, of, an, earlier, ancestor, language, which, he, called, a, common, source, but, did, not, name, the, sanscrit, language, whatever, be, its, antiquity, is, of, a, wonderful, structure, more, perfect, than, the, greek, more, copious, than, the, latin, and, more, exquisitely, refined, than, either, yet, bearing, to, both, of, them, a, stronger, affinity, both, in, the, roots, of, verbs, and, the, forms, of, grammar, than, could, possibly, have, been, produced, by, accident, so, strong, indeed, that, no, philologer, could, examine, them, all, three, without, believing, them, to, have, sprung, from, some, common, source, which, perhaps, no, longer, exists, thomas, young, first, used, the, term, indo, european, in, 1813, deriving, it, from, the, geographical, extremes, of, the, language, family, from, western, europe, to, north, india, a, synonym, is, indo, germanic, idg, or, idg, specifying, the, family, s, southeasternmost, and, northwesternmost, branches, this, first, appeared, in, french, indo, germanique, in, 1810, in, the, work, of, conrad, malte, brun, in, most, languages, this, term, is, now, dated, or, less, common, than, indo, european, although, in, german, indogermanisch, remains, the, standard, scientific, term, a, number, of, other, synonymous, terms, have, also, been, used, franz, bopp, wrote, in, 1816, on, the, conjugational, system, of, the, sanskrit, language, compared, with, that, of, greek, latin, persian, and, germanic, and, between, 1833, and, 1852, he, wrote, comparative, grammar, this, marks, the, beginning, of, indo, european, studies, as, an, academic, discipline, the, classical, phase, of, indo, european, comparative, linguistics, leads, from, this, work, to, august, schleicher, s, 1861, compendium, and, up, to, karl, brugmann, s, grundriss, published, in, the, 1880s, brugmann, s, neogrammarian, reevaluation, of, the, field, and, ferdinand, de, saussure, s, development, of, the, laryngeal, theory, may, be, considered, the, beginning, of, modern, indo, european, studies, the, generation, of, indo, europeanists, active, in, the, last, third, of, the, 20th, century, such, as, calvert, watkins, jochem, schindler, and, helmut, rix, developed, a, better, understanding, of, morphology, and, of, ablaut, in, the, wake, of, kury, owicz, s, 1956, apophony, in, indo, european, who, in, 1927, pointed, out, the, existence, of, the, hittite, consonant, kury, owicz, s, discovery, supported, ferdinand, de, saussure, s, 1879, proposal, of, the, existence, of, coefficients, sonantiques, elements, de, saussure, reconstructed, to, account, for, vowel, length, alternations, in, indo, european, languages, this, led, to, the, so, called, laryngeal, theory, a, major, step, forward, in, indo, european, linguistics, and, a, confirmation, of, de, saussure, s, theory, the, various, subgroups, of, the, indo, european, language, family, include, ten, major, branches, listed, below, in, alphabetical, order, in, addition, to, the, classical, ten, branches, listed, above, several, extinct, and, little, known, languages, and, language, groups, have, existed, or, are, proposed, to, have, existed, membership, of, languages, in, the, indo, european, language, family, is, determined, by, genealogical, relationships, meaning, that, all, members, are, presumed, descendants, of, a, common, ancestor, proto, indo, european, membership, in, the, various, branches, groups, and, subgroups, of, indo, european, is, also, genealogical, but, here, the, defining, factors, are, shared, innovations, among, various, languages, suggesting, a, common, ancestor, that, split, off, from, other, indo, european, groups, for, example, what, makes, the, germanic, languages, a, branch, of, indo, european, is, that, much, of, their, structure, and, phonology, can, be, stated, in, rules, that, apply, to, all, of, them, many, of, their, common, features, are, presumed, innovations, that, took, place, in, proto, germanic, the, source, of, all, the, germanic, languages, in, the, 21st, century, several, attempts, have, been, made, to, model, the, phylogeny, of, indo, european, languages, using, bayesian, methodologies, similar, to, those, applied, to, problems, in, biological, phylogeny, although, there, are, differences, in, absolute, timing, between, the, various, analyses, there, is, much, commonality, between, them, including, the, result, that, the, first, known, language, groups, to, diverge, were, the, anatolian, and, tocharian, language, families, in, that, order, the, tree, model, is, considered, an, appropriate, representation, of, the, genealogical, history, of, a, language, family, if, communities, do, not, remain, in, contact, after, their, languages, have, started, to, diverge, in, this, case, subgroups, defined, by, shared, innovations, form, a, nested, pattern, the, tree, model, is, not, appropriate, in, cases, where, languages, remain, in, contact, as, they, diversify, in, such, cases, subgroups, may, overlap, and, the, wave, model, is, a, more, accurate, representation, most, approaches, to, indo, european, subgrouping, to, date, have, assumed, that, the, tree, model, is, by, and, large, valid, for, indo, european, however, there, is, also, a, long, tradition, of, wave, model, approaches, in, addition, to, genealogical, changes, many, of, the, early, changes, in, indo, european, languages, can, be, attributed, to, language, contact, it, has, been, asserted, for, example, that, many, of, the, more, striking, features, shared, by, italic, languages, latin, oscan, umbrian, etc, might, well, be, areal, features, more, certainly, very, similar, looking, alterations, in, the, systems, of, long, vowels, in, the, west, germanic, languages, greatly, postdate, any, possible, notion, of, a, proto, language, innovation, and, cannot, readily, be, regarded, as, areal, either, because, english, and, continental, west, germanic, were, not, a, linguistic, area, in, a, similar, vein, there, are, many, similar, innovations, in, germanic, and, balto, slavic, that, are, far, more, likely, areal, features, than, traceable, to, a, common, proto, language, such, as, the, uniform, development, of, a, high, vowel, u, in, the, case, of, germanic, i, u, in, the, case, of, baltic, and, slavic, before, the, pie, syllabic, resonants, unique, to, these, two, groups, among, ie, languages, which, is, in, agreement, with, the, wave, model, the, balkan, sprachbund, even, features, areal, convergence, among, members, of, very, different, branches, an, extension, to, the, ringe, warnow, model, of, language, evolution, suggests, that, early, ie, had, featured, limited, contact, between, distinct, lineages, with, only, the, germanic, subfamily, exhibiting, a, less, treelike, behaviour, as, it, acquired, some, characteristics, from, neighbours, early, in, its, evolution, the, internal, diversification, of, especially, west, germanic, is, cited, to, have, been, radically, non, treelike, specialists, have, postulated, the, existence, of, higher, order, subgroups, such, as, italo, celtic, graeco, armenian, graeco, aryan, or, graeco, armeno, aryan, and, balto, slavo, germanic, however, unlike, the, ten, traditional, branches, these, are, all, controversial, to, a, greater, or, lesser, degree, the, italo, celtic, subgroup, was, at, one, point, uncontroversial, considered, by, antoine, meillet, to, be, even, better, established, than, balto, slavic, the, main, lines, of, evidence, included, the, genitive, suffix, the, superlative, suffix, m, mo, the, change, of, p, to, k, before, another, k, in, the, same, word, as, in, penk, e, k, enk, e, latin, qu, nque, old, irish, c, ic, and, the, subjunctive, morpheme, this, evidence, was, prominently, challenged, by, calvert, watkins, while, michael, weiss, has, argued, for, the, subgroup, evidence, for, a, relationship, between, greek, and, armenian, includes, the, regular, change, of, the, second, laryngeal, to, a, at, the, beginnings, of, words, as, well, as, terms, for, woman, and, sheep, greek, and, indo, iranian, share, innovations, mainly, in, verbal, morphology, and, patterns, of, nominal, derivation, relations, have, also, been, proposed, between, phrygian, and, greek, and, between, thracian, and, armenian, some, fundamental, shared, features, like, the, aorist, a, verb, form, denoting, action, without, reference, to, duration, or, completion, having, the, perfect, active, particle, s, fixed, to, the, stem, link, this, group, closer, to, anatolian, languages, and, tocharian, shared, features, with, balto, slavic, languages, on, the, other, hand, especially, present, and, preterit, formations, might, be, due, to, later, contacts, the, indo, hittite, hypothesis, proposes, that, the, indo, european, language, family, consists, of, two, main, branches, one, represented, by, the, anatolian, languages, and, another, branch, encompassing, all, other, indo, european, languages, features, that, separate, anatolian, from, all, other, branches, of, indo, european, such, as, the, gender, or, the, verb, system, have, been, interpreted, alternately, as, archaic, debris, or, as, innovations, due, to, prolonged, isolation, points, proffered, in, favour, of, the, indo, hittite, hypothesis, are, the, non, universal, indo, european, agricultural, terminology, in, anatolia, and, the, preservation, of, laryngeals, however, in, general, this, hypothesis, is, considered, to, attribute, too, much, weight, to, the, anatolian, evidence, according, to, another, view, the, anatolian, subgroup, left, the, indo, european, parent, language, comparatively, late, approximately, at, the, same, time, as, indo, iranian, and, later, than, the, greek, or, armenian, divisions, a, third, view, especially, prevalent, in, the, so, called, french, school, of, indo, european, studies, holds, that, extant, similarities, in, non, satem, languages, in, general, including, anatolian, might, be, due, to, their, peripheral, location, in, the, indo, european, language, area, and, to, early, separation, rather, than, indicating, a, special, ancestral, relationship, hans, j, holm, based, on, lexical, calculations, arrives, at, a, picture, roughly, replicating, the, general, scholarly, opinion, and, refuting, the, indo, hittite, hypothesis, the, division, of, the, indo, european, languages, into, satem, and, centum, groups, was, put, forward, by, peter, von, bradke, in, 1890, although, karl, brugmann, did, propose, a, similar, type, of, division, in, 1886, in, the, satem, languages, which, include, the, balto, slavic, and, indo, iranian, branches, as, well, as, in, most, respects, albanian, and, armenian, the, reconstructed, proto, indo, european, palatovelars, remained, distinct, and, were, fricativized, while, the, labiovelars, merged, with, the, plain, velars, in, the, centum, languages, the, palatovelars, merged, with, the, plain, velars, while, the, labiovelars, remained, distinct, the, results, of, these, alternative, developments, are, exemplified, by, the, words, for, hundred, in, avestan, satem, and, latin, centum, the, initial, palatovelar, developed, into, a, fricative, in, the, former, but, became, an, ordinary, velar, in, the, latter, rather, than, being, a, genealogical, separation, the, centum, satem, division, is, commonly, seen, as, resulting, from, innovative, changes, that, spread, across, pie, dialect, branches, over, a, particular, geographical, area, the, centum, satem, isogloss, intersects, a, number, of, other, isoglosses, that, mark, distinctions, between, features, in, the, early, ie, branches, it, may, be, that, the, centum, branches, in, fact, reflect, the, original, state, of, affairs, in, pie, and, only, the, satem, branches, shared, a, set, of, innovations, which, affected, all, but, the, peripheral, areas, of, the, pie, dialect, continuum, kortlandt, proposes, that, the, ancestors, of, balts, and, slavs, took, part, in, satemization, before, being, drawn, later, into, the, western, indo, european, sphere, from, the, very, beginning, of, indo, european, studies, there, have, been, attempts, to, link, the, indo, european, languages, genealogically, to, other, languages, and, language, families, however, these, theories, remain, highly, controversial, and, most, specialists, in, indo, european, linguistics, are, skeptical, or, agnostic, about, such, proposals, proposals, linking, the, indo, european, languages, with, a, single, language, family, include, other, proposed, families, include, nostratic, and, eurasiatic, in, turn, have, been, included, in, even, wider, groupings, such, as, borean, a, language, family, separately, proposed, by, harold, c, fleming, and, sergei, starostin, that, encompasses, almost, all, of, the, world, s, natural, languages, with, the, exception, of, those, native, to, sub, saharan, africa, new, guinea, australia, and, the, andaman, islands, the, proposed, proto, indo, european, language, pie, is, the, reconstructed, common, ancestor, of, the, indo, european, languages, spoken, by, the, proto, indo, europeans, from, the, 1960s, knowledge, of, anatolian, became, certain, enough, to, establish, its, relationship, to, pie, using, the, method, of, internal, reconstruction, an, earlier, stage, called, pre, proto, indo, european, has, been, proposed, pie, is, an, inflected, language, in, which, the, grammatical, relationships, between, words, were, signaled, through, inflectional, morphemes, usually, endings, the, roots, of, pie, are, basic, morphemes, carrying, a, lexical, meaning, by, addition, of, suffixes, they, form, stems, and, by, addition, of, endings, these, form, grammatically, inflected, words, nouns, or, verbs, the, reconstructed, indo, european, verb, system, is, complex, and, like, the, noun, exhibits, a, system, of, ablaut, the, diversification, of, the, parent, language, into, the, attested, branches, of, daughter, languages, is, historically, unattested, the, timeline, of, the, evolution, of, the, various, daughter, languages, on, the, other, hand, is, mostly, undisputed, quite, regardless, of, the, question, of, indo, european, origins, using, a, mathematical, analysis, borrowed, from, evolutionary, biology, donald, ringe, and, tandy, warnow, propose, the, following, evolutionary, tree, of, indo, european, branches, david, anthony, proposes, the, following, sequence, from, 1500, bc, the, following, sequence, may, be, given, in, reconstructing, the, history, of, the, indo, european, languages, and, the, form, of, the, proto, indo, european, language, some, languages, have, been, of, particular, importance, these, generally, include, the, ancient, indo, european, languages, that, are, both, well, attested, and, documented, at, an, early, date, although, some, languages, from, later, periods, are, important, if, they, are, particularly, linguistically, conservative, most, notably, lithuanian, early, poetry, is, of, special, significance, because, of, the, rigid, poetic, meter, normally, employed, which, makes, it, possible, to, reconstruct, a, number, of, features, e, g, vowel, length, that, were, either, unwritten, or, corrupted, in, the, process, of, transmission, down, to, the, earliest, extant, written, manuscripts, most, noticeable, of, all, other, primary, sources, other, secondary, sources, of, lesser, value, due, to, poor, attestation, other, secondary, sources, of, lesser, value, due, to, extensive, phonological, changes, and, relatively, limited, attestation, as, the, proto, indo, european, pie, language, broke, up, its, sound, system, diverged, as, well, changing, according, to, various, sound, laws, evidenced, in, the, daughter, languages, pie, is, normally, reconstructed, with, a, complex, system, of, 15, stop, consonants, including, an, unusual, three, way, phonation, voicing, distinction, between, voiceless, voiced, and, voiced, aspirated, i, e, breathy, voiced, stops, and, a, three, way, distinction, among, velar, consonants, k, type, sounds, between, palatal, h, plain, velar, k, g, gh, and, labiovelar, k, g, g, h, the, correctness, of, the, terms, palatal, and, plain, velar, is, disputed, see, proto, indo, european, phonology, all, daughter, languages, have, reduced, the, number, of, distinctions, among, these, sounds, often, in, divergent, ways, as, an, example, in, english, one, of, the, germanic, languages, the, following, are, some, of, the, major, changes, that, happened, each, original, consonant, shifted, one, position, to, the, right, for, example, original, d, became, d, while, original, d, became, t, and, original, t, became, written, th, in, english, this, is, the, original, source, of, the, english, sounds, written, f, th, h, and, wh, examples, comparing, english, with, latin, where, the, sounds, largely, remain, unshifted, none, of, the, daughter, language, families, except, possibly, anatolian, particularly, luvian, reflect, the, plain, velar, stops, differently, from, the, other, two, series, and, there, is, even, a, certain, amount, of, dispute, whether, this, series, existed, at, all, in, pie, the, major, distinction, between, centum, and, satem, languages, corresponds, to, the, outcome, of, the, pie, plain, velars, the, three, way, pie, distinction, between, voiceless, voiced, and, voiced, aspirated, stops, is, considered, extremely, unusual, from, the, perspective, of, linguistic, typology, particularly, in, the, existence, of, voiced, aspirated, stops, without, a, corresponding, series, of, voiceless, aspirated, stops, none, of, the, various, daughter, language, families, continue, it, unchanged, with, numerous, solutions, to, the, apparently, unstable, pie, situation, among, the, other, notable, changes, affecting, consonants, are, the, following, table, shows, the, basic, outcomes, of, pie, consonants, in, some, of, the, most, important, daughter, languages, for, the, purposes, of, reconstruction, for, a, fuller, table, see, indo, european, sound, laws, the, following, table, presents, a, comparison, of, conjugations, of, the, thematic, present, indicative, of, the, verbal, root, b, er, of, the, english, verb, to, bear, and, its, reflexes, in, various, early, attested, ie, languages, and, their, modern, descendants, or, relatives, showing, that, all, languages, had, in, the, early, stage, an, inflectional, verb, system, while, similarities, are, still, visible, between, the, modern, descendants, and, relatives, of, these, ancient, languages, the, differences, have, increased, over, time, some, ie, languages, have, moved, from, synthetic, verb, systems, to, largely, periphrastic, systems, in, addition, the, pronouns, of, periphrastic, forms, are, in, parentheses, when, they, appear, some, of, these, verbs, have, undergone, a, change, in, meaning, as, well, today, indo, european, languages, are, spoken, by, billions, of, native, speakers, across, all, inhabited, continents, the, largest, number, by, far, for, any, recognised, language, family, of, the, 20, languages, with, the, largest, numbers, of, speakers, according, to, ethnologue, 10, are, indo, european, english, hindustani, spanish, bengali, french, russian, portuguese, german, persian, and, punjabi, each, with, 100, million, speakers, or, more, additionally, hundreds, of, millions, of, persons, worldwide, study, indo, european, languages, as, secondary, or, tertiary, languages, including, in, cultures, which, have, completely, different, language, families, and, historical, backgrounds, there, are, around, 600, million, learners, of, english, alone, the, success, of, the, language, family, including, the, large, number, of, speakers, and, the, vast, portions, of, the, earth, that, they, inhabit, is, due, to, several, factors, the, ancient, indo, european, migrations, and, widespread, dissemination, of, indo, european, culture, throughout, eurasia, including, that, of, the, proto, indo, europeans, themselves, and, that, of, their, daughter, cultures, including,
