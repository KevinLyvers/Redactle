a, trade, union, british, english, or, labor, union, american, english, often, simply, referred, to, as, a, union, is, an, organization, of, workers, whose, purpose, is, to, maintain, or, improve, the, conditions, of, their, employment, such, as, attaining, better, wages, and, benefits, improving, working, conditions, improving, safety, standards, establishing, complaint, procedures, developing, rules, governing, status, of, employees, rules, governing, promotions, just, cause, conditions, for, termination, and, protecting, and, increasing, the, bargaining, power, of, workers, trade, unions, typically, fund, their, head, office, and, legal, team, functions, through, regularly, imposed, fees, called, union, dues, the, union, representatives, in, the, workforce, are, usually, made, up, of, workplace, volunteers, who, are, often, appointed, by, members, through, internal, democratic, elections, the, trade, union, through, an, elected, leadership, and, bargaining, committee, bargains, with, the, employer, on, behalf, of, its, members, known, as, the, rank, and, file, and, negotiates, labour, contracts, collective, bargaining, agreements, with, employers, unions, may, organize, a, particular, section, of, skilled, or, unskilled, workers, craft, unionism, a, cross, section, of, workers, from, various, trades, general, unionism, or, an, attempt, to, organize, all, workers, within, a, particular, industry, industrial, unionism, the, agreements, negotiated, by, a, union, are, binding, on, the, rank, and, file, members, and, the, employer, and, in, some, cases, on, other, non, member, workers, trade, unions, traditionally, have, a, constitution, which, details, the, governance, of, their, bargaining, unit, and, also, have, governance, at, various, levels, of, government, depending, on, the, industry, that, binds, them, legally, to, their, negotiations, and, functioning, originating, in, the, united, kingdom, trade, unions, became, popular, in, many, countries, during, the, industrial, revolution, trade, unions, may, be, composed, of, individual, workers, professionals, past, workers, students, apprentices, or, the, unemployed, trade, union, density, or, the, percentage, of, workers, belonging, to, a, trade, union, is, highest, in, the, nordic, countries, since, the, publication, of, the, history, of, trade, unionism, 1894, by, sidney, and, beatrice, webb, the, predominant, historical, view, is, that, a, trade, union, is, a, continuous, association, of, wage, earners, for, the, purpose, of, maintaining, or, improving, the, conditions, of, their, employment, karl, marx, described, trade, unions, thus, the, value, of, labour, power, constitutes, the, conscious, and, explicit, foundation, of, the, trade, unions, whose, importance, for, the, working, class, can, scarcely, be, overestimated, the, trade, unions, aim, at, nothing, less, than, to, prevent, the, reduction, of, wages, below, the, level, that, is, traditionally, maintained, in, the, various, branches, of, industry, that, is, to, say, they, wish, to, prevent, the, price, of, labour, power, from, falling, below, its, value, capital, v1, 1867, p, 1069, early, socialists, also, saw, trade, unions, as, a, way, to, democratize, the, workplace, in, order, to, obtain, political, power, a, modern, definition, by, the, australian, bureau, of, statistics, states, that, a, trade, union, is, an, organisation, consisting, predominantly, of, employees, the, principal, activities, of, which, include, the, negotiation, of, rates, of, pay, and, conditions, of, employment, for, its, members, recent, historical, research, by, bob, james, puts, forward, the, view, that, trade, unions, are, part, of, a, broader, movement, of, benefit, societies, which, includes, medieval, guilds, freemasons, oddfellows, friendly, societies, and, other, fraternal, organizations, following, the, unification, of, the, city, states, in, assyria, and, sumer, by, sargon, of, akkad, into, a, single, empire, c, 2334, bc, a, common, mesopotamian, standard, for, length, area, volume, weight, and, time, used, by, artisan, guilds, in, each, city, was, promulgated, by, naram, sin, of, akkad, c, 2254, 2218, bc, sargon, s, grandson, including, for, shekels, codex, hammurabi, law, 234, c, 1755, 1750, bc, stipulated, a, 2, shekel, prevailing, wage, for, each, 60, gur, 300, bushel, vessel, constructed, in, an, employment, contract, between, a, shipbuilder, and, a, ship, owner, law, 275, stipulated, a, ferry, rate, of, 3, gerah, per, day, on, a, charterparty, between, a, ship, charterer, and, a, shipmaster, law, 276, stipulated, a, 2, 1, 2, gerah, per, day, freight, rate, on, a, contract, of, affreightment, between, a, charterer, and, shipmaster, while, law, 277, stipulated, a, 1, 6, shekel, per, day, freight, rate, for, a, 60, gur, vessel, in, 1816, an, archaeological, excavation, in, minya, egypt, under, an, eyalet, of, the, ottoman, empire, produced, a, nerva, antonine, dynasty, era, tablet, from, the, ruins, of, the, temple, of, antinous, in, antino, polis, that, prescribed, the, rules, and, membership, dues, of, a, burial, society, collegium, established, in, lanuvium, in, approximately, 133, ad, during, the, reign, of, hadrian, 117, 138, of, the, roman, empire, a, collegium, was, any, association, in, ancient, rome, that, acted, as, a, legal, entity, following, the, passage, of, the, lex, julia, during, the, reign, of, julius, caesar, 49, 44, bc, and, their, reaffirmation, during, the, reign, of, caesar, augustus, 27,

at, the, site, of, the, artificial, harbor, portus, in, rome, revealed, inscriptions, in, a, shipyard, constructed, during, the, reign, of, trajan, 98, 117, indicating, the, existence, of, a, shipbuilders, guild, rome, s, la, ostia, port, was, home, to, a, guildhall, for, a, corpus, naviculariorum, a, collegium, of, merchant, mariners, collegium, also, included, fraternities, of, roman, priests, overseeing, ritual, sacrifices, practising, augury, keeping, scriptures, arranging, festivals, and, maintaining, specific, religious, cults, while, a, commonly, held, mistaken, view, holds, modern, trade, unionism, to, be, a, product, of, marxism, the, earliest, modern, trade, unions, predate, marx, s, communist, manifesto, 1848, by, almost, a, century, and, marx, s, writings, themselves, frequently, address, the, prior, existence, of, the, workers, movements, of, his, time, the, first, recorded, labour, strike, in, the, united, states, was, by, philadelphia, printers, in, 1786, who, opposed, a, wage, reduction, and, demanded, 6, per, week, in, wages, the, origins, of, modern, trade, unions, can, be, traced, back, to, 18th, century, britain, where, the, industrial, revolution, drew, masses, of, people, including, dependents, peasants, and, immigrants, into, cities, britain, had, ended, the, practice, of, serfdom, in, 1574, but, the, vast, majority, of, people, remained, as, tenant, farmers, on, estates, owned, by, the, landed, aristocracy, this, transition, was, not, merely, one, of, relocation, from, rural, to, urban, environs, rather, the, nature, of, industrial, work, created, a, new, class, of, worker, a, farmer, worked, the, land, raised, animals, and, grew, crops, and, either, owned, the, land, or, paid, rent, but, ultimately, sold, a, product, and, had, control, over, his, life, and, work, as, industrial, workers, however, the, workers, sold, their, work, as, labour, and, took, directions, from, employers, giving, up, part, of, their, freedom, and, self, agency, in, the, service, of, a, master, the, critics, of, the, new, arrangement, would, call, this, wage, slavery, but, the, term, that, persisted, was, a, new, form, of, human, relations, employment, unlike, farmers, workers, often, had, less, control, over, their, jobs, without, job, security, or, a, promise, of, an, on, going, relationship, with, their, employers, they, lacked, some, control, over, the, work, they, performed, or, how, it, impacted, their, health, and, life, it, is, in, this, context, that, modern, trade, unions, emerge, in, the, cities, trade, unions, encountered, much, hostility, from, employers, and, government, groups, in, the, united, states, unions, and, unionists, were, regularly, prosecuted, under, various, restraint, of, trade, and, conspiracy, laws, such, as, the, sherman, antitrust, act, this, pool, of, unskilled, and, semi, skilled, labour, spontaneously, organized, in, fits, and, starts, throughout, its, beginnings, and, would, later, be, an, important, arena, for, the, development, of, trade, unions, trade, unions, have, sometimes, been, seen, as, successors, to, the, guilds, of, medieval, europe, though, the, relationship, between, the, two, is, disputed, as, the, masters, of, the, guilds, employed, workers, apprentices, and, journeymen, who, were, not, allowed, to, organize, trade, unions, and, collective, bargaining, were, outlawed, from, no, later, than, the, middle, of, the, 14th, century, when, the, ordinance, of, labourers, was, enacted, in, the, kingdom, of, england, but, their, way, of, thinking, was, the, one, that, endured, down, the, centuries, inspiring, evolutions, and, advances, in, thinking, which, eventually, gave, workers, more, power, as, collective, bargaining, and, early, worker, unions, grew, with, the, onset, of, the, industrial, revolution, the, government, began, to, clamp, down, on, what, it, saw, as, the, danger, of, popular, unrest, at, the, time, of, the, napoleonic, wars, in, 1799, the, combination, act, was, passed, which, banned, trade, unions, and, collective, bargaining, by, british, workers, although, the, unions, were, subject, to, often, severe, repression, until, 1824, they, were, already, widespread, in, cities, such, as, london, workplace, militancy, had, also, manifested, itself, as, luddism, and, had, been, prominent, in, struggles, such, as, the, 1820, rising, in, scotland, in, which, 60, 000, workers, went, on, a, general, strike, which, was, soon, crushed, sympathy, for, the, plight, of, the, workers, brought, repeal, of, the, acts, in, 1824, although, the, combination, act, 1825, severely, restricted, their, activity, by, the, 1810s, the, first, labour, organizations, to, bring, together, workers, of, divergent, occupations, were, formed, possibly, the, first, such, union, was, the, general, union, of, trades, also, known, as, the, philanthropic, society, founded, in, 1818, in, manchester, the, latter, name, was, to, hide, the, organization, s, real, purpose, in, a, time, when, trade, unions, were, still, illegal, the, first, attempts, at, forming, a, national, general, union, in, the, united, kingdom, were, made, in, the, 1820s, and, 30s, the, national, association, for, the, protection, of, labour, was, established, in, 1830, by, john, doherty, after, an, apparently, unsuccessful, attempt, to, create, a, similar, national, presence, with, the, national, union, of, cotton, spinners, the, association, quickly, enrolled, approximately, 150, unions, consisting, mostly, of, textile, related, unions, but, also, including, mechanics, blacksmiths, and, various, others, membership, rose, to, between, 10, 000, and, 20, 000, individuals, spread, across, the, five, counties, of, lancashire, cheshire, derbyshire, nottinghamshire, and, leicestershire, within, a, year, to, establish, awareness, and, legitimacy, the, union, started, the, weekly, voice, of, the, people, publication, having, the, declared, intention, to, unite, the, productive, classes, of, the, community, in, one, common, bond, of, union, in, 1834, the, welsh, socialist, robert, owen, established, the, grand, national, consolidated, trades, union, the, organization, attracted, a, range, of, socialists, from, owenites, to, revolutionaries, and, played, a, part, in, the, protests, after, the, tolpuddle, martyrs, case, but, soon, collapsed, more, permanent, trade, unions, were, established, from, the, 1850s, better, resourced, but, often, less, radical, the, london, trades, council, was, founded, in, 1860, and, the, sheffield, outrages, spurred, the, establishment, of, the, trades, union, congress, in, 1868, the, first, long, lived, national, trade, union, center, by, this, time, the, existence, and, the, demands, of, the, trade, unions, were, becoming, accepted, by, liberal, middle, class, opinion, in, principles, of, political, economy, 1871, john, stuart, mill, wrote, if, it, were, possible, for, the, working, classes, by, combining, among, themselves, to, raise, or, keep, up, the, general, rate, of, wages, it, needs, hardly, be, said, that, this, would, be, a, thing, not, to, be, punished, but, to, be, welcomed, and, rejoiced, at, unfortunately, the, effect, is, quite, beyond, attainment, by, such, means, the, multitudes, who, compose, the, working, class, are, too, numerous, and, too, widely, scattered, to, combine, at, all, much, more, to, combine, effectually, if, they, could, do, so, they, might, doubtless, succeed, in, diminishing, the, hours, of, labour, and, obtaining, the, same, wages, for, less, work, they, would, also, have, a, limited, power, of, obtaining, by, combination, an, increase, of, general, wages, at, the, expense, of, profits, beyond, this, claim, mill, also, argued, that, because, individual, workers, had, no, basis, for, assessing, the, wages, for, a, particular, task, labour, unions, would, lead, to, greater, efficiency, of, the, market, system, british, trade, unions, were, finally, legalized, in, 1872, after, a, royal, commission, on, trade, unions, in, 1867, agreed, that, the, establishment, of, the, organizations, was, to, the, advantage, of, both, employers, and, employees, this, period, also, saw, the, growth, of, trade, unions, in, other, industrializing, countries, especially, the, united, states, germany, and, france, in, the, united, states, the, first, effective, nationwide, labour, organization, was, the, knights, of, labor, in, 1869, which, began, to, grow, after, 1880, legalization, occurred, slowly, as, a, result, of, a, series, of, court, decisions, the, federation, of, organized, trades, and, labor, unions, began, in, 1881, as, a, federation, of, different, unions, that, did, not, directly, enrol, workers, in, 1886, it, became, known, as, the, american, federation, of, labor, or, afl, in, germany, the, free, association, of, german, trade, unions, was, formed, in, 1897, after, the, conservative, anti, socialist, laws, of, chancellor, otto, von, bismarck, were, repealed, in, france, labour, organization, was, illegal, until, 1884, the, bourse, du, travail, was, founded, in, 1887, and, merged, with, the, f, d, ration, nationale, des, syndicats, national, federation, of, trade, unions, in, 1895, to, form, the, general, confederation, of, labour, in, a, number, of, countries, during, the, 20th, century, including, in, canada, the, united, states, and, the, united, kingdom, legislation, was, passed, to, provide, for, the, voluntary, or, statutory, recognition, of, a, union, by, an, employer, union, density, has, been, steadily, declining, from, the, oecd, average, of, 35, 9, in, 1998, to, 27, 9, in, the, year, 2018, the, main, reasons, for, these, developments, are, a, decline, in, manufacturing, increased, globalization, and, governmental, policies, the, decline, in, manufacturing, is, the, most, direct, influence, as, unions, were, historically, beneficial, and, prevalent, in, the, sector, for, this, reason, there, may, be, an, increase, in, developing, nations, as, oecd, nations, continue, to, export, manufacturing, industries, to, these, markets, the, second, reason, is, globalization, which, makes, it, harder, for, unions, to, maintain, standards, across, countries, the, last, reason, is, governmental, policies, these, come, from, both, sides, of, the, political, spectrum, in, the, uk, and, us, it, has, been, mostly, right, wing, proposals, that, make, it, harder, for, unions, to, form, or, that, limit, their, power, on, the, other, side, there, are, many, social, policies, such, as, minimum, wage, paid, vacation, parental, leave, etc, that, decrease, the, need, to, be, in, a, union, the, prevalence, of, labour, unions, can, be, measured, by, union, density, which, is, expressed, as, a, percentage, of, the, total, number, of, workers, in, a, given, location, who, are, trade, union, members, the, table, below, shows, the, percentage, across, oecd, members, source, oecd, unions, may, organize, a, particular, section, of, skilled, workers, craft, unionism, traditionally, found, in, australia, canada, denmark, norway, sweden, switzerland, the, uk, and, the, us, a, cross, section, of, workers, from, various, trades, general, unionism, traditionally, found, in, australia, belgium, canada, denmark, netherlands, the, uk, and, the, us, or, attempt, to, organize, all, workers, within, a, particular, industry, industrial, unionism, found, in, australia, canada, germany, finland, norway, south, korea, sweden, switzerland, the, uk, and, the, us, these, unions, are, often, divided, into, locals, and, united, in, national, federations, these, federations, themselves, will, affiliate, with, internationals, such, as, the, international, trade, union, confederation, however, in, japan, union, organisation, is, slightly, different, due, to, the, presence, of, enterprise, unions, i, e, unions, that, are, specific, to, a, plant, or, company, these, enterprise, unions, however, join, industry, wide, federations, which, in, turn, are, members, of, rengo, the, japanese, national, trade, union, confederation, in, western, europe, professional, associations, often, carry, out, the, functions, of, a, trade, union, in, these, cases, they, may, be, negotiating, for, white, collar, or, professional, workers, such, as, physicians, engineers, or, teachers, in, sweden, the, white, collar, unions, have, a, strong, position, in, collective, bargaining, where, they, cooperate, with, blue, colar, unions, in, setting, the, mark, the, industry, norm, in, negotiations, with, the, employers, association, in, manufacturing, industry, a, union, may, acquire, the, status, of, a, juristic, person, an, artificial, legal, entity, with, a, mandate, to, negotiate, with, employers, for, the, workers, it, represents, in, such, cases, unions, have, certain, legal, rights, most, importantly, the, right, to, engage, in, collective, bargaining, with, the, employer, or, employers, over, wages, working, hours, and, other, terms, and, conditions, of, employment, the, inability, of, the, parties, to, reach, an, agreement, may, lead, to, industrial, action, culminating, in, either, strike, action, or, management, lockout, or, binding, arbitration, in, extreme, cases, violent, or, illegal, activities, may, develop, around, these, events, in, some, regions, unions, may, face, active, repression, either, by, governments, or, by, extralegal, organizations, with, many, cases, of, violence, some, having, lead, to, deaths, having, been, recorded, historically, unions, may, also, engage, in, broader, political, or, social, struggle, social, unionism, encompasses, many, unions, that, use, their, organizational, strength, to, advocate, for, social, policies, and, legislation, favourable, to, their, members, or, to, workers, in, general, as, well, unions, in, some, countries, are, closely, aligned, with, political, parties, many, labour, parties, were, founded, as, the, electoral, arms, of, trade, unions, unions, are, also, delineated, by, the, service, model, and, the, organizing, model, the, service, model, union, focuses, more, on, maintaining, worker, rights, providing, services, and, resolving, disputes, alternately, the, organizing, model, typically, involves, full, time, union, organizers, who, work, by, building, up, confidence, strong, networks, and, leaders, within, the, workforce, and, confrontational, campaigns, involving, large, numbers, of, union, members, many, unions, are, a, blend, of, these, two, philosophies, and, the, definitions, of, the, models, themselves, are, still, debated, informal, workers, often, face, unique, challenges, when, trying, to, participate, in, trade, union, movements, as, formal, trade, union, organizations, recognized, by, the, state, and, employers, may, not, accommodate, for, the, employment, categories, common, in, the, informal, economy, simultaneously, the, lack, of, regular, work, locations, and, loopholes, relating, to, false, self, employment, add, barriers, and, costs, for, the, trade, unions, when, trying, to, organize, the, informal, economy, this, has, been, a, significant, threshold, to, labour, organizing, in, low, income, countries, where, the, labour, force, mostly, works, in, the, informal, economy, in, the, united, kingdom, the, perceived, left, leaning, nature, of, trade, unions, and, their, historical, close, alignment, with, the, labour, party, has, resulted, in, the, formation, of, a, reactionary, right, wing, trade, union, called, solidarity, which, is, supported, by, the, far, right, bnp, in, denmark, there, are, some, newer, apolitical, discount, unions, who, offer, a, very, basic, level, of, services, as, opposed, to, the, dominating, danish, pattern, of, extensive, services, and, organizing, in, contrast, in, several, european, countries, e, g, belgium, denmark, the, netherlands, and, switzerland, religious, unions, have, existed, for, decades, these, unions, typically, distanced, themselves, from, some, of, the, doctrines, of, orthodox, marxism, such, as, the, preference, of, atheism, and, from, rhetoric, suggesting, that, employees, interests, always, are, in, conflict, with, those, of, employers, some, of, these, christian, unions, have, had, some, ties, to, centrist, or, conservative, political, movements, and, some, do, not, regard, strikes, as, acceptable, political, means, for, achieving, employees, goals, in, poland, the, biggest, trade, union, solidarity, emerged, as, an, anti, communist, movement, with, religious, nationalist, overtones, and, today, it, supports, the, right, wing, law, and, justice, party, although, their, political, structure, and, autonomy, varies, widely, union, leaderships, are, usually, formed, through, democratic, elections, some, research, such, as, that, conducted, by, the, australian, centre, for, industrial, relations, research, and, training, argues, that, unionized, workers, enjoy, better, conditions, and, wages, than, those, who, are, not, unionized, the, oldest, global, trade, union, organizations, include, the, world, federation, of, trade, unions, created, in, 1945, the, largest, trade, union, federation, in, the, world, is, the, brussels, based, international, trade, union, confederation, ituc, created, in, 2006, which, has, approximately, 309, affiliated, organizations, in, 156, countries, and, territories, with, a, combined, membership, of, 166, million, national, and, regional, trade, unions, organizing, in, specific, industry, sectors, or, occupational, groups, also, form, global, union, federations, such, as, uni, global, industriall, the, international, transport, workers, federation, the, international, federation, of, journalists, the, international, arts, and, entertainment, alliance, and, public, services, international, union, law, varies, from, country, to, country, as, does, the, function, of, unions, for, example, german, and, dutch, unions, have, played, a, greater, role, in, management, decisions, through, participation, in, supervisory, boards, and, co, determination, than, other, countries, moreover, in, the, united, states, collective, bargaining, is, most, commonly, undertaken, by, unions, directly, with, employers, whereas, in, austria, denmark, germany, or, sweden, unions, most, often, negotiate, with, employers, associations, a, form, of, sectoral, bargaining, concerning, labour, market, regulation, in, the, eu, gold, 1993, and, hall, 1994, have, identified, three, distinct, systems, of, labour, market, regulation, which, also, influence, the, role, that, unions, play, the, united, states, takes, a, more, laissez, faire, approach, setting, some, minimum, standards, but, leaving, most, workers, wages, and, benefits, to, collective, bargaining, and, market, forces, thus, it, comes, closest, to, the, above, anglo, saxon, model, also, the, eastern, european, countries, that, have, recently, entered, into, the, eu, come, closest, to, the, anglo, saxon, model, in, contrast, in, germany, the, relation, between, individual, employees, and, employers, is, considered, to, be, asymmetrical, in, consequence, many, working, conditions, are, not, negotiable, due, to, a, strong, legal, protection, of, individuals, however, the, german, flavor, or, works, legislation, has, as, its, main, objective, to, create, a, balance, of, power, between, employees, organized, in, unions, and, employers, organized, in, employers, associations, this, allows, much, wider, legal, boundaries, for, collective, bargaining, compared, to, the, narrow, boundaries, for, individual, negotiations, as, a, condition, to, obtain, the, legal, status, of, a, trade, union, employee, associations, need, to, prove, that, their, leverage, is, strong, enough, to, serve, as, a, counterforce, in, negotiations, with, employers, if, such, an, employee, s, association, is, competing, against, another, union, its, leverage, may, be, questioned, by, unions, and, then, evaluated, in, labour, court, in, germany, only, very, few, professional, associations, obtained, the, right, to, negotiate, salaries, and, working, conditions, for, their, members, notably, the, medical, doctor, s, association, marburger, bund, and, the, pilots, association, vereinigung, cockpit, the, engineer, s, association, verein, deutscher, ingenieure, does, not, strive, to, act, as, a, union, as, it, also, represents, the, interests, of, engineering, businesses, beyond, the, classification, listed, above, unions, relations, with, political, parties, vary, in, many, countries, unions, are, tightly, bonded, or, even, share, leadership, with, a, political, party, intended, to, represent, the, interests, of, the, working, class, typically, this, is, a, left, wing, socialist, or, social, democratic, party, but, many,

miliband, who, beat, his, brother, david, miliband, to, become, leader, of, the, party, after, ed, secured, the, trade, union, votes, additionally, in, the, past, there, was, a, group, known, as, the,

helped, to, reduce, inequality, whereas, weaker, unions, have, made, it, easier, for, ceos, sometimes, working, with, market, forces, that, they, have, helped, shape, to, increase, it, evidence, indicates, that, those, who, are, not, members, of, unions, also, see, higher, wages, researchers, suggest, that, unions, set, industrial, norms, as, firms, try, to, stop, further, unionization, or, losing, workers, to, better, paying, competitors, the, decline, in, unionization, since, the, 1960s, in, the, united, states, has, been, associated, with, a, pronounced, rise, in, income, and, wealth, inequality, and, since, 1967, with, loss, of, middle, class, income, right, to, work, laws, have, been, linked, to, greater, economic, inequality, in, the, united, states, the, hoover, institution, think, tank, has, asserted, that, the, economic, inequality, argument, made, in, favor, of, trade, unions, misfires, on, several, fronts, those, high, union, wages, could, not, survive, in, the, face, of, foreign, competition, or, new, nonunionized, firms, the, only, way, a, union, can, provide, gains, for, its, members, is, to, extract, some, fraction, of, the, profits, that, firms, enjoy, when, they, hold, monopoly, positions, the, think, tank, has, also, asserted, that, the, decline, of, trade, unions, in, the, united, states, cannot, drive, widespread, inequality, for, the, entire, population, which, is, also, affected, by, a, rise, in, the, knowledge, economy, as, well, as, a, general, aging, of, the, population, research, from, norway, has, found, that, high, unionization, rates, lead, to, substantial, increases, in, firm, productivity, as, well, as, increases, in, workers, wages, research, from, belgium, also, found, productivity, gains, although, smaller, however, other, research, in, the, united, states, has, found, that, unions, can, harm, profitability, employment, and, business, growth, rates, uk, research, on, employment, wages, productivity, and,

research, from, the, anglosphere, indicates, that, unions, can, provide, wage, premiums, and, reduce, inequality, while, reducing, employment, growth, and, restricting, employment, flexibility, some, trade, unions, oppose, approaches, which, increase, productivity, such, as, automation, in, the, united, states, the, outsourcing, of, labour, to, asia, latin, america, and, africa, has, been,

produced, and, the, shareholders, of, the, unionized, business, economist, milton, friedman, sought, to, show, that, unionization, produces, higher, wages, for, the, union, members, at, the, expense, of, fewer, jobs, and, that, if, some, industries, are, unionized, while, others, are, not, wages, will, tend, to, decline, in, non, unionized, industries, friedrich, hayek, criticized, unions, in,

the, interests, of, the, poor, whereas, areas, with, lower, unionization, rates, are, more, responsive, to, the, interests, of, the, rich, higher, unionization, rates, increase, the, likelihood, of,

collective, actor, and, an, essential, vehicle, for, working, class, action, at, the, same, time, unions, are, an, imperfect, and, incomplete, vehicle, for, the, working, class, to, achieve, one, of,
