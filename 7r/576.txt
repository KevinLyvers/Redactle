although, it, is, clear, that, books, were, printed, earlier, movable, clay, type, was, invented, in, 1041, in, china, however, due, to, the, slow, spread, of, literacy, to, the, masses, in, china, and, the, relatively, high, cost, of, paper, there, the, earliest, printed, mass, medium, was, probably, european, popular, prints, from, about, 1400, although, these, were, produced, in, huge, numbers, very, few, early, examples, survive, and, even, most, known, to, be, printed, before, about, 1600, have, not, survived, the, term, mass, media, was, coined, with, the, creation, of, print, media, which, is, notable, for, being, the, first, example, of, mass, media, as, we, use, the, term, today, this, form, of, media, started, in, europe, in, the, middle, ages, johannes, gutenberg, s, invention, of, the, printing, press, allowed, the, mass, production, of, books, to, sweep, the, nation, he, printed, the, first, book, a, latin, bible, on, a, printing, press, with, movable, type, in, 1453, the, invention, of, the, printing, press, gave, rise, to, some, of, the, first, forms, of, mass, communication, by, enabling, the, publication, of, books, and, newspapers, on, a, scale, much, larger, than, was, previously, possible, the, invention, also, transformed, the, way, the, world, received, printed, materials, although, books, remained, too, expensive, really, to, be, called, a, mass, medium, for, at, least, a, century, after, that, newspapers, developed, from, about, 1612, with, the, first, example, in, english, in, 1620, but, they, took, until, the, 19th, century, to, reach, a, mass, audience, directly, the, first, high, circulation, newspapers, arose, in, london, in, the, early, 1800s, such, as, the, times, and, were, made, possible, by, the, invention, of, high, speed, rotary, steam, printing, presses, and, railroads, which, allowed, large, scale, distribution, over, wide, geographical, areas, the, increase, in, circulation, however, led, to, a, decline, in, feedback, and, interactivity, from, the, readership, making, newspapers, a, more, one, way, medium, the, phrase, the, media, began, to, be, used, in, the, 1920s, the, notion, of, mass, media, was, generally, restricted, to, print, media, up, until, the, post, second, world, war, when, radio, television, and, video, were, introduced, the, audio, visual, facilities, became, very, popular, because, they, provided, both, information, and, entertainment, because, the, colour, and, sound, engaged, the, viewers, listeners, and, because, it, was, easier, for, the, general, public, to, passively, watch, tv, or, listen, to, the, radio, than, to, actively, read, in, recent, times, the, internet, become, the, latest, and, most, popular, mass, medium, information, has, become, readily, available, through, websites, and, easily, accessible, through, search, engines, one, can, do, many, activities, at, the, same, time, such, as, playing, games, listening, to, music, and, social, networking, irrespective, of, location, whilst, other, forms, of, mass, media, are, restricted, in, the, type, of, information, they, can, offer, the, internet, comprises, a, large, percentage, of, the, sum, of, human, knowledge, through, such, things, as, google, books, modern, day, mass, media, includes, the, internet, mobile, phones, blogs, podcasts, and, rss, feeds, during, the, 20th, century, the, growth, of, mass, media, was, driven, by, technology, including, that, which, allowed, much, duplication, of, material, physical, duplication, technologies, such, as, printing, record, pressing, and, film, duplication, allowed, the, duplication, of, books, newspapers, and, movies, at, low, prices, to, huge, audiences, radio, and, television, allowed, the, electronic, duplication, of, information, for, the, first, time, mass, media, had, the, economics, of, linear, replication, a, single, work, could, make, money, an, example, of, riel, and, neil, s, theory, proportional, to,

be, a, threat, to, democracy, between, 1985, and, 2018, about, 76, 720, deals, have, been, announced, in, the, media, industry, this, sums, up, to, an, overall, value, of, around, us, 5, 634, billion,

forced, them, to, purchase, the, product, the, barbie, and, ken, dolls, of, the, 1950s, are, sometimes, cited, as, the, main, cause, for, the, obsession, in, modern, day, society, for, women, to, be,

of, the, mass, media, portraying, inaccurate, information, could, lead, to, an, immense, public, concern, in, his, book, the, commercialization, of, american, culture, matthew, p, mcallister, says, that, a, well, developed, media, system, informing, and, teaching, its, citizens, helps, democracy, move, toward, its, ideal, state, in, 1997, j, r, finnegan, jr, and, k, viswanath, identified, three, main, effects, or, functions, of, mass, media, since, the, 1950s, when, cinema, radio, and, tv, began, to, be, the, primary, or, only, source, of, information, for, most, of, the, population, these, media, became, the, central, instruments, of, mass, control, when, a, country, reaches, a, high, level, of, industrialisation, the, country, itself, belongs, to, the, person, who, controls, communications, mass, media, play, a, significant, role, in, shaping, public, perceptions, on, a, variety, of, important, issues, both, through, the, information, that, is, dispensed, through, them, and, through, the, interpretations, they, place, upon, this, information, they, also, play, a, large, role, in, shaping, modern, culture, by, selecting, and, portraying, a, particular, set, of, beliefs, values, and, traditions, an, entire, way, of, life, as, reality, that, is, by, portraying, a, certain, interpretation, of, reality, they, shape, reality, to, be, more, in, line, with, that, interpretation, mass, media, also, play, a, crucial, role, in, the, spread, of, civil, unrest, activities, such, as, anti, government, demonstrations, riots, and, general, strikes, that, is, the, use, of, radio, and, television, receivers, has, made, the, unrest, influence, among, cities, not, only, by, the, geographic, location, of, cities, but, also, by, proximity, within, the, mass, media, distribution, networks, mass, media, sources, through, theories, like, framing, and, agenda, setting, can, affect, the, scope, of, a, story, as, particular, facts, and, information, are, highlighted, media, influence, this, can, directly, correlate, with, how, individuals, may, perceive, certain, groups, of, people, as, the, only, media, coverage, a, person, receives, can, be, very, limited, and, may, not, reflect, the, whole, story, or, situation, stories, are, often, covered, to, reflect, a, particular, perspective, to, target, a, specific, demographic, according, to, stephen, balkaran, an, instructor, of, political, science, and, african, american, studies, at, central, connecticut, state, university, mass, media, has, played, a, large, role, in, the, way, white, americans, perceive, african, americans, the, media, focus, on, african, american, in, the, contexts, of, crime, drug, use, gang, violence, and, other, forms, of, anti, social, behavior, has, resulted, in, a, distorted, and, harmful, public, perception, of, african, americans, in, his, 1999, article, mass, media, and, racism, balkaran, states, the, media, has, played, a, key, role, in, perpetuating, the, effects, of, this, historical, oppression, and, in, contributing, to, african, americans, continuing, status, as, second, class, citizens, this, has, resulted, in, an, uncertainty, among, white, americans, as, to, what, the, genuine, nature, of, african, americans, really, is, despite, the, resulting, racial, divide, the, fact, that, these, people, are, undeniably, american, has, raised, doubts, about, the, white, man, s, value, system, this, means, that, there, is, a, somewhat, troubling, suspicion, among, some, americans, that, their, white, america, is, tainted, by, the, black, influence, mass, media, as, well, as, propaganda, tend, to, reinforce, or, introduce, stereotypes, to, the, general, public, lack, of, local, or, specific, topic, focus, is, a, common, criticism, of, mass, media, a, mass, news, media, outlet, is, often, forced, to, cover, national, and, international, news, due, to, it, having, to, cater, for, and, be, relevant, for, a, wide, demographic, as, such, it, has, to, skip, over, many, interesting, or, important, local, stories, because, they, simply, do, not, interest, the, large, majority, of, their, viewers, the, term, mass, suggests, that, the, recipients, of, media, products, constitute, a, vast, sea, of, passive, undifferentiated, individuals, this, is, an, image, associated, with, some, earlier, critiques, of, mass, culture, and, mass, society, which, generally, assumed, that, the, development, of, mass, communication, has, had, a, largely, negative, impact, on, modern, social, life, creating, a, kind, of, bland, and, homogeneous, culture, which, entertains, individuals, without, challenging, them, however, interactive, digital, media, have, also, been, seen, to, challenge, the, read, only, paradigm, of, earlier, broadcast, media, since, the, 1950s, in, the, countries, that, have, reached, a, high, level, of, industrialisation, the, mass, media, of, cinema, radio, and, tv, have, a, key, role, in, political, power, contemporary, research, demonstrates, an, increasing, level, of, concentration, of, media, ownership, with, many, media, industries, already, highly, concentrated, and, dominated, by, a, small, number, of, firms, when, the, study, of, mass, media, began, the, media, was, compiled, of, only, mass, media, which, is, a, very, different, media, system, than, the, social, media, empire, of, the, 21st, century, experiences, with, this, in, mind, there, are, critiques, that, mass, media, no, longer, exists, or, at, least, that, it, does, not, exist, in, the, same, form, as, it, once, did, this, original, form, of, mass, media, put, filters, on, what, the, general, public, would, be, exposed, to, in, regards, to, news, something, that, is, harder, to, do, in, a, society, of, social, media, theorist, lance, bennett, explains, that, excluding, a, few, major, events, in, recent, history, it, is, uncommon, for, a, group, big, enough, to, be, labeled, a, mass, to, be, watching, the, same, news, via, the, same, medium, of, mass, production, bennett, s, critique, of, 21st, century, mass, media, argues, that, today, it, is, more, common, for, a, group, of, people, to, be, receiving, different, news, stories, from, completely, different, sources, and, thus, mass, media, has, been, re, invented, as, discussed, above, filters, would, have, been, applied, to, original, mass, medias, when, the, journalists, decided, what, would, or, would, not, be, printed, social, media, is, a, large, contributor, to, the, change, from, mass, media, to, a, new, paradigm, because, through, social, media, what, is, mass, communication, and, what, is, interpersonal, communication, is, confused, interpersonal, niche, communication, is, an, exchange, of, information, and, information, in, a, specific, genre, in, this, form, of, communication, smaller, groups, of, people, are, consuming, news, information, opinions, in, contrast, mass, media, in, its, original, form, is, not, restricted, by, genre, and, it, is, being, consumed, by, the, masses
