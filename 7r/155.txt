this, holds, especially, true, for, those, holidays, that, have, combined, and, absorbed, rituals, overtones, or, practices, from, non, christian, beliefs, into, the, celebration, as, well, as, those,

the, claimed, over, secularisation, of, particular, holidays, has, caused, controversy, and, claims, of, censorship, of, religion, or, political, correctness, for, example, in, the, 1990s, birmingham, city, council, promoted, a, series, of, events, in, the, christmas, season, under, the, brand, winterval, to, create, a, more, multi, cultural, atmosphere, about, the, seasonal, festivities, the, bishop, of, birmingham, responded, to, the, events, saying, the, secular, world, which, expresses, respect, for, all, is, actually, embarrassed, by, faith, or, perhaps, it, is, christianity, which, is, censored, in, the, united, states, conservative, commentators, have, characterised, the, secularisation, of, winter, festivities, as, the, war, on, christmas, these, are, holidays, that, are, not, traditionally, marked, on, calendars, these, holidays, are, celebrated, by, various, groups, and, individuals, some, promote, a, cause, others, recognize, historical, events, not, officially, recognized, and, others, are, funny, holidays, celebrated, with, humorous, intent, for, example, monkey, day, is, celebrated, on, december, 14, international, talk, like, a, pirate, day, is, observed, on, september, 19, and, blasphemy, day, is, held, on, september, 30, other, examples, are, april, fools, day, on, april, 1, and, world, no, tobacco, day, on, may, 31, various, community, organizers, and, marketers, promote, odd, social, media, holidays, in, the, united, states, holidays, have, been, drawn, into, a, culture, of, consumption, since, the, late, 19th, century, many, civic, religious, and, folk, festivals, have, been, commercialised, as, such, traditions, have, been, reshaped, to, serve, the, needs, of, industry, leigh, eric, schmidt, argues, that, the, growth, of, consumption, culture, allowed, the, growth, of, holidays, as, an, opportunity, for, increased, public, consumption, and, the, orderly, timing, of, it, thus, after, the, civil, war, as, department, stores, became, the, spatial, expression, of, commercialism, holidays, became, the, temporal, expression, of, it
