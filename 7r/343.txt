in, the, philosophy, of, language, and, linguistics, a, speech, act, is, something, expressed, by, an, individual, that, not, only, presents, information, but, performs, an, action, as, well, for, example, the, phrase, i, would, like, the, mashed, potatoes, could, you, please, pass, them, to, me, is, considered, a, speech, act, as, it, expresses, the, speaker, s, desire, to, acquire, the, mashed, potatoes, as, well, as, presenting, a, request, that, someone, pass, the, potatoes, to, them, according, to, kent, bach, almost, any, speech, act, is, really, the, performance, of, several, acts, at, once, distinguished, by, different, aspects, of, the, speaker, s, intention, there, is, the, act, of, saying, something, what, one, does, in, saying, it, such, as, requesting, or, promising, and, how, one, is, trying, to, affect, one, s, audience, the, contemporary, use, of, the, term, speech, act, goes, back, to, j, l, austin, s, development, of, performative, utterances, and, his, theory, of, locutionary, illocutionary, and, perlocutionary, acts, speech, acts, serve, their, function, once, they, are, said, or, communicated, these, are, commonly, taken, to, include, acts, such, as, apologizing, promising, ordering, answering, requesting, complaining, warning, inviting, refusing, and, congratulating, for, much, of, the, history, of, the, positivist, philosophy, of, language, language, was, viewed, primarily, as, a, way, of, making, factual, assertions, and, the, other, uses, of, language, tended, to, be, ignored, as, austin, states, at, the, beginning, of, lecture, 1, it, was, for, too, long, the, assumption, of, philosophers, that, the, business, of, a, statement, can, only, be, to, describe, some, state, of, affairs, or, to, state, some, fact, which, it, must, do, either, truly, or, falsely, 1, wittgenstein, came, up, with, the, idea, of, don, t, ask, for, the, meaning, ask, for, the, use, showing, language, as, a, new, vehicle, for, social, activity, speech, act, theory, hails, from, wittgenstein, s, philosophical, theories, wittgenstein, believed, meaning, derives, from, pragmatic, tradition, demonstrating, the, importance, of, how, language, is, used, to, accomplish, objectives, within, specific, situations, by, following, rules, to, accomplish, a, goal, communication, becomes, a, set, of, language, games, thus, utterances, do, more, than, reflect, a, meaning, they, are, words, designed, to, get, things, done, the, work, of, j, l, austin, particularly, his, how, to, do, things, with, words, led, philosophers, to, pay, more, attention, to, the, non, declarative, uses, of, language, the, terminology, he, introduced, especially, the, notions, locutionary, act, illocutionary, act, and, perlocutionary, act, occupied, an, important, role, in, what, was, then, to, become, the, study, of, speech, acts, all, of, these, three, acts, but, especially, the, illocutionary, act, are, nowadays, commonly, classified, as, speech, acts, austin, was, by, no, means, the, first, one, to, deal, with, what, one, could, call, speech, acts, in, a, wider, sense, the, term, social, act, and, some, of, the, theory, of, this, type, of, linguistic, action, are, to, be, found, in, the, fifth, of, thomas, reid, s, essays, on, the, active, powers, of, the, human, mind, 1788, chapter, vi, of, the, nature, of, a, contract, adolf, reinach, 1883, 1917, and, stanislav, krabec, 1844, 1918, have, been, both, independently, credited, with, a, fairly, comprehensive, account, of, social, acts, as, performative, utterances, dating, to, 1913, long, before, austin, and, searle, the, term, speech, act, had, also, been, already, used, by, karl, b, hler, speech, acts, can, be, analysed, on, multiple, levels, the, concept, of, an, illocutionary, act, is, central, to, the, concept, of, a, speech, act, although, there, are, several, scholarly, opinions, regarding, how, to, define, illocutionary, acts, there, are, some, kinds, of, acts, that, are, widely, accepted, as, illocutionary, examples, of, these, widely, accepted, acts, are, commands, or, promises, the, first, of, these, opinions, is, the, one, held, by, john, l, austin, who, coined, the, term, speech, act, in, his, book, how, to, do, things, with, words, published, posthumously, in, 1962, according, to, austin, s, preliminary, informal, description, the, idea, of, an, illocutionary, act, can, be, captured, by, emphasizing, that, by, saying, something, we, do, something, as, when, someone, issues, an, order, to, someone, to, go, by, saying, go, or, when, a, minister, joins, two, people, in, marriage, saying, i, now, pronounce, you, husband, and, wife, austin, would, eventually, define, the, illocutionary, act, in, a, more, exact, manner, john, r, searle, gave, an, alternative, to, austin, s, explanation, of, the, illocutionary, act, saying, a, speech, act, is, often, meant, to, refer, to, exactly, the, same, thing, as, the, term, illocutionary, act, searle, s, work, on, speech, acts, is, understood, to, further, refine, austin, s, conception, however, some, philosophers, have, pointed, out, a, significant, difference, between, the, two, conceptions, whereas, austin, emphasized, the, conventional, interpretation, of, speech, acts, searle, emphasized, a, psychological, interpretation, based, on, beliefs, intentions, etc, while, illocutionary, acts, relate, more, to, the, speaker, perlocutionary, acts, are, centered, around, the, listener, perlocutionary, acts, always, have, a, perlocutionary, effect, which, is, the, effect, a, speech, act, has, on, a, listener, this, could, affect, the, listener, s, thoughts, emotions, or, even, their, physical, actions, an, example, of, this, could, be, if, someone, uttered, the, sentence, i, m, hungry, the, perlocutionary, effect, on, the, listener, could, be, the, effect, of, being, persuaded, by, the, utterance, for, example, after, hearing, the, utterance, the, listener, could, be, persuaded, to, make, a, sandwich, for, the, speaker, an, interesting, type, of, illocutionary, speech, act, is, that, performed, in, the, utterance, of, what, austin, calls, performative, utterances, typical, instances, of, which, are, i, nominate, john, to, be, president, i, sentence, you, to, ten, years, imprisonment, or, i, promise, to, pay, you, back, in, these, typical, rather, explicit, cases, of, performative, sentences, the, action, that, the, sentence, describes, nominating, sentencing, promising, is, performed, by, the, utterance, of, the, sentence, itself, j, l, austin, claimed, that, performative, sentences, could, be, happy, or, unhappy, they, were, only, happy, if, the, speaker, does, the, actions, he, or, she, talks, about, they, were, unhappy, if, this, did, not, happen, performative, speech, acts, also, use, explicit, verbs, instead, of, implicit, ones, for, example, stating, i, intend, to, go, does, convey, information, but, it, does, not, really, mean, that, you, are, promising, to, go, so, it, does, not, count, as, performing, an, action, such, as, the, action, of, promising, to, go, therefore, it, is, an, implicit, verb, i, e, a, verb, that, would, not, be, suitable, for, use, in, performative, speech, acts, in, the, course, of, performing, speech, acts, people, communicate, with, each, other, the, content, of, communication, may, be, identical, or, almost, identical, with, the, content, intended, to, be, communicated, as, when, a, stranger, asks, what, is, your, name, however, the, meaning, of, the, linguistic, means, used, may, also, be, different, from, the, content, intended, to, be, communicated, one, may, in, appropriate, circumstances, request, peter, to, do, the, dishes, by, just, saying, peter, or, one, can, promise, to, do, the, dishes, by, saying, me, one, common, way, of, performing, speech, acts, is, to, use, an, expression, which, indicates, one, speech, act, and, indeed, performs, this, act, but, also, performs, a, further, speech, act, which, is, indirect, one, may, for, instance, say, peter, can, you, close, the, window, thereby, asking, peter, whether, he, will, be, able, to, close, the, window, but, also, requesting, that, he, does, so, since, the, request, is, performed, indirectly, by, means, of, directly, performing, a, question, it, counts, as, an, indirect, speech, act, an, even, more, indirect, way, of, making, such, a, request, would, be, to, say, in, peter, s, presence, in, the, room, with, the, open, window, i, m, cold, the, speaker, of, this, request, must, rely, upon, peter, s, understanding, of, several, items, of, information, that, is, not, explicit, that, the, window, is, open, and, is, the, cause, of, them, being, cold, that, being, cold, is, an, uncomfortable, sensation, and, they, wish, it, to, be, taken, care, of, and, that, peter, cares, to, rectify, this, situation, by, closing, the, window, this, of, course, depends, much, on, the, relationship, between, the, requester, and, peter, he, might, understand, the, request, differently, if, they, were, his, boss, at, work, than, if, they, were, his, girlfriend, or, boyfriend, at, home, the, more, presumed, information, pertaining, to, the, request, the, more, indirect, the, speech, act, may, be, considered, to, be, indirect, speech, acts, are, commonly, used, to, reject, proposals, and, to, make, requests, for, example, if, a, speaker, asks, would, you, like, to, meet, me, for, coffee, and, the, other, replies, i, have, class, the, second, speaker, has, used, an, indirect, speech, act, to, reject, the, proposal, this, is, indirect, because, the, literal, meaning, of, i, have, class, does, not, entail, any, sort, of, rejection, this, poses, a, problem, for, linguists, as, it, is, confusing, to, see, how, the, person, who, made, the, proposal, can, understand, that, his, proposal, was, rejected, in, 1975, john, searle, suggested, that, the, illocutionary, force, of, indirect, speech, acts, can, be, derived, by, means, of, a, gricean, reasoning, process, however, the, process, he, proposes, does, not, seem, to, accurately, solve, the, problem, in, other, words, this, means, that, one, does, not, need, to, say, the, words, apologize, pledge, or, praise, in, order, to, show, they, are, doing, the, action, all, the, examples, above, show, how, the, actions, and, indirect, words, make, something, happen, rather, than, coming, out, straightforward, with, specific, words, and, saying, it, speech, acts, are, commonplace, in, everyday, interactions, and, are, important, for, communication, as, well, as, present, in, many, different, contexts, examples, of, these, include, in, 1975, john, dore, proposed, that, children, s, utterances, were, realizations, of, one, of, nine, primitive, speech, acts, there, is, no, agreed, formalization, of, speech, act, theory, in, 1985, john, searle, and, d, vandervecken, attempted, to, give, some, grounds, of, an, illocutionary, logic, other, attempts, have, been, proposed, by, per, martin, l, f, for, a, treatment, of, the, concept, of, assertion, inside, intuitionistic, type, theory, and, by, carlo, dalla, pozza, with, a, proposal, of, a, formal, pragmatics, connecting, propositional, content, given, with, classical, semantics, and, illocutionary, force, given, by, intuitionistic, semantics, up, to, now, the, main, basic, formal, applications, of, speech, act, theory, are, to, be, found, in, the, field, of, human, computer, interaction, in, chatboxes, and, other, tools, recent, work, in, artificial, intelligence, proposes, a, bayesian, approach, to, formalize, speech, acts, in, 1991, computational, speech, act, models, of, human, computer, conversation, were, developed, and, in, 2004, speech, act, theory, has, been, used, to, model, conversations, for, automated, classification, and, retrieval, another, highly, influential, view, of, speech, acts, has, been, in, the, conversation, for, action, developed, by, terry, winograd, and, fernando, flores, in, their, 1986, text, understanding, computers, and, cognition, a, new, foundation, for, design, arguably, the, most, important, part, of, their, analysis, lies, in, a, state, transition, diagram, in, chapter, 5, that, winograd, and, flores, claim, underlies, the, significant, illocutionary, speech, act, claims, of, two, parties, attempting, to, coordinate, action, with, one, another, no, matter, whether, the, agents, involved, might, be, human, human, human, computer, or, computer, computer, a, key, part, of, this, analysis, is, the, contention, that, one, dimension, of, the, social, domain, tracking, the, illocutionary, status, of, the, transaction, whether, individual, participants, claim, that, their, interests, have, been, met, or, not, is, very, readily, conferred, to, a, computer, process, regardless, of, whether, the, computer, has, the, means, to, adequately, represent, the, real, world, issues, underlying, that, claim, thus, a, computer, instantiating, the, conversation, for, action, has, the, useful, ability, to, model, the, status, of, the, current, social, reality, independent, of, any, external, reality, on, which, social, claims, may, be, based, this, transactional, view, of, speech, acts, has, significant, applications, in, many, areas, in, which, human, individuals, have, had, different, roles, for, instance, a, patient, and, a, physician, might, meet, in, an, encounter, in, which, the, patient, makes, a, request, for, treatment, the, physician, responds, with, a, counter, offer, involving, a, treatment, they, feel, is, appropriate, and, the, patient, might, respond, etc, such, a, conversation, for, action, can, describe, a, situation, in, which, an, external, observer, such, as, a, computer, or, health, information, system, may, be, able, to, track, the, illocutionary, or, speech, act, status, of, negotiations, between, the, patient, and, physician, participants, even, in, the, absence, of, any, adequate, model, of, the, illness, or, proposed, treatments, the, key, insight, provided, by, winograd, and, flores, is, that, the, state, transition, diagram, representing, the, social, illocutionary, negotiation, of, the, two, parties, involved, is, generally, much, much, simpler, than, any, model, representing, the, world, in, which, those, parties, are, making, claims, in, short, the, system, tracking, the, status, of, the, conversation, for, action, need, not, be, concerned, with, modeling, all, of, the, realities, of, the, external, world, a, conversation, for, action, is, critically, dependent, upon, certain, stereotypical, claims, about, the, status, of, the, world, made, by, the, two, parties, thus, a, conversation, for, action, can, be, readily, tracked, and, facilitated, by, a, device, with, little, or, no, ability, to, model, circumstances, in, the, real, world, other, than, the, ability, to, register, claims, by, specific, agents, about, a, domain, in, the, past, philosophy, has, discussed, rules, for, when, expressions, are, used, the, two, rules, are, constitutive, and, regulative, rules, the, concept, of, constitutive, rules, finds, its, origin, in, wittgenstein, and, john, rawls, and, has, been, elaborated, by, g, c, j, midgley, max, black, g, h, von, wright, david, shwayder, and, john, searle, whereas, regulative, rules, are, prescriptions, that, regulate, a, pre, existing, activity, whose, existence, is, logically, independent, of, the, rules, constitutive, rules, constitute, an, activity, the, existence, of, which, is, logically, dependent, on, the, rules, for, example, traffic, rules, are, regulative, rules, that, prescribe, certain, behaviour, in, order, to, regulate, the, traffic, without, these, rules, however, the, traffic, would, not, cease, to, be, in, contrast, the, rules, of, chess, are, constitutive, rules, that, constitute, the, game, without, these, rules, chess, would, not, exist, since, the, game, is, logically, dependent, on, the, rules, multi, agent, systems, sometimes, use, speech, act, labels, to, express, the, intent, of, an, agent, when, it, sends, a, message, to, another, agent, for, example, the, intent, inform, in, the, message, inform, content, may, be, interpreted, as, a, request, that, the, receiving, agent, adds, the, item, content, to, its, knowledge, base, this, is, in, contrast, to, the, message, query, content, which, may, be, interpreted, depending, on, the, semantics, employed, as, a, request, to, see, if, the, item, content, is, currently, in, the, receiving, agents, knowledge, base, there, are, at, least, two, standardisations, of, speech, act, labelled, messaging, kqml, and, fipa, kqml, and, fipa, are, based, on, the, searlian, that, is, psychological, semantics, of, speech, acts, munindar, p, singh, has, long, advocated, moving, away, from, the, psychological, to, a, social, semantics, of, speech, acts, one, that, would, be, in, tune, with, austin, s, conception, andrew, jones, has, also, been, a, critic, of, the, psychological, conception, a, recent, collection, of, manifestos, by, researchers, in, agent, communication, reflects, a, growing, recognition, in, the, multiagent, systems, community, of, the, benefits, of, a, social, semantics, in, political, science, the, copenhagen, school, adopts, speech, act, as, a, form, of, felicitous, speech, act, or, simply, facilitating, conditions, whereby, the, speaker, often, politicians, or, players, act, in, accordance, to, the, truth, but, in, preparation, for, the, audience, to, take, action, in, the, directions, of, the, player, that, are, driven, or, incited, by, the, act, this, forms, an, observable, framework, under, a, specified, subject, matter, from, the, player, and, the, audience, who, are, under, theorised, remain, outside, of, the, framework, itself, and, would, benefit, from, being, both, brought, in, and, drawn, out, it, is, because, the, audience, would, not, be, informed, of, the, intentions, of, the, player, except, to, focus, on, the, display, of, the, speech, act, itself, therefore, in, the, perspective, of, the, player, the, truth, of, the, subject, matter, is, irrelevant, except, the, result, produced, via, the, audience, the, study, of, speech, acts, is, prevalent, in, legal, theory, since, laws, themselves, can, be, interpreted, as, speech, acts, laws, issue, out, a, command, to, their, constituents, which, can, be, realized, as, an, action, when, forming, a, legal, contract, speech, acts, can, be, made, when, people, are, making, or, accepting, an, offer, considering, the, theory, of, freedom, of, speech, some, speech, acts, may, not, be, legally, protected, for, example, a, death, threat, is, a, type, of, speech, act, and, is, considered, to, exist, outside, of, the, protection, of, freedom, of, speech, as, it, is, treated, as, a, criminal, act, in, a, sociological, perspective, nicolas, brisset, adopts, the, concept, of, speech, act, in, order, to, understand, how, economic, models, participate, in, the, making, and, the, spreading, of, representations, inside, and, outside, of, the, scientific, field, brisset, argues, that, models, perform, actions, in, different, fields, scientific, academic, practical, and, political, this, multiplicity, of, fields, induces, a, variety, of, felicity, conditions, and, types, of, performed, actions, this, perspective, is, a, criticism, of, the, essentialism, of, philosophical, modelling, studies, this, approach, is, largely, inspired, by, the, work, of, pierre, bourdieu, and, quentin, skinner, in, finance, it, is, possible, to, understand, mathematical, models, as, speech, acts, in, 2016, the, notion, of, financial, logos, was, defined, as, the, speech, act, of, mathematical, modelling, of, financial, risks, the, action, of, the, financial, logos, on, financial, practices, is, the, framing, of, financial, decision, making, by, risk, modelling
