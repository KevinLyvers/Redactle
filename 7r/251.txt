southeastern, turkey, northwestern, iran, northern, iraq, and, northern, syria, there, are, exclaves, of, kurds, in, central, anatolia, khorasan, and, the, caucasus, as, well, as, significant, kurdish, diaspora, communities, in, the, cities, of, western, turkey, in, particular, istanbul, and, western, europe, primarily, in, germany, the, kurdish, population, is, estimated, to, be, between, 30, and, 45, million, kurds, speak, the, kurdish, languages, and, the, zaza, gorani, languages, which, belong, to, the, western, iranian, branch, of, the, iranian, languages, kurds, do, not, comprise, a, majority, in, any, country, making, them, a, stateless, people, after, world, war, i, and, the, defeat, of, the, ottoman, empire, the, victorious, western, allies, made, provision, for, a, kurdish, state, in, the, 1920, treaty, of, s, vres, however, that, promise, was, broken, three, years, later, when, the, treaty, of, lausanne, set, the, boundaries, of, modern, turkey, and, made, no, such, provision, leaving, kurds, with, minority, status, in, all, of, the, new, countries, of, turkey, iraq, and, syria, recent, history, of, the, kurds, includes, numerous, genocides, and, rebellions,

greater, cultural, rights, autonomy, and, independence, throughout, kurdistan, the, exact, origins, of, the, name, kurd, are, unclear, the, underlying, toponym, is, recorded, in, assyrian, as, qardu, and, in, middle, bronze, age, sumerian, as, kar, da, assyrian, qardu, refers, to, an, area, in, the, upper, tigris, basin, and, it, is, presumably, reflected, in, corrupted, form, in, classical, arabic, d, re, adopted, in, kurdish, as, c, d, the, name, would, be, continued, as, the, first, element, in, the, toponym, corduene, mentioned, by, xenophon, as, the, tribe, who, opposed, the, retreat, of, the, ten, thousand, through, the, mountains, north, of, mesopotamia, in, the, 4th, century, bc, there, are, however, dissenting, views, which, do, not, derive, the, name, of, the, kurds, from, qardu, and, corduene, but, opt, for, derivation, from, cyrtii, cyrtaei, instead, regardless, of, its, possible, roots, in, ancient, toponymy, the, ethnonym, kurd, might, be, derived, from, a, term, kwrt, used, in, middle, persian, as, a, common, noun, to, refer, to, nomads, or, tent, dwellers, which, could, be, applied, as, an, attribute, to, any, iranian, group, with, such, a, lifestyle, the, term, gained, the, characteristic, of, an, ethnonym, following, the, muslim, conquest, of, persia, as, it, was, adopted, into, arabic, and, gradually, became, associated, with, an, amalgamation, of, iranian, and, iranianized, tribes, and, groups, in, the, region, sharafkhan, bidlisi, in, the, 16th, century, states, that, there, are, four, division, of, kurds, kurmanj, lur, kalhor, and, guran, each, of, which, speak, a, different, dialect, or, language, variation, paul, 2008, notes, that, the, 16th, century, usage, of, the, term, kurd, as, recorded, by, bidlisi, regardless, of, linguistic, grouping, might, still, reflect, an, incipient, northwestern, iranian, kurdish, ethnic, identity, uniting, the, kurmanj, kalhur, and, guran, kurdish, kurdish, kurd, or, is, a, collection, of, related,

by, arab, geographers, such, as, al, masudi, since, the, 10th, century, many, kurds, are, either, bilingual, or, multilingual, speaking, the, language, of, their, respective, nation, of, origin, such, as, arabic, persian, and, turkish, as, a, second, language, alongside, their, native, kurdish, while, those, in, diaspora, communities, often, speak, three, or, more, languages, turkified, and, arabised, kurds, often, speak, little, or, no, kurdish, according, to, mackenzie, there, are, few, linguistic, features, that, all, kurdish, dialects, have, in, common, and, that, are, not, at, the, same, time, found, in, other, iranian, languages, the, kurdish, dialects, according, to, mackenzie, are, classified, as, the, zaza, and, gorani, are, ethnic, kurds, but, the, zaza, gorani, languages,

religions, that, are, associated, with, kurdistan, although, most, of, the, sacred, yarsan, texts, are, in, the, gorani, and, all, of, the, yarsan, holy, places, are, located, in, kurdistan, followers, of, this, religion, are, also, found, in, other, regions, for, example, while, there, are, more, than, 300, 000, yarsani, in, iraqi, kurdistan, there, are, more, than, 2, million, yarsani, in, iran, however, the, yarsani, lack, political, rights, in, both, countries, the, iranian, religion, of, zoroastrianism, has, had, a, major, influence, on, the, iranian, culture, which, kurds, are,

zoroastrianism, in, the, kurdistan, region, claimed, that, many, were, returning, to, zoroastrianism, but, some, kept, it, secret, out, of, fear, of, reprisals, from, islamists, although, historically, there, have, been, various, accounts, of, kurdish, christians, most, often, these, were, in, the, form, of, individuals, and, not, as, communities, however, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, century, various, travel, logs, tell, of, kurdish, christian, tribes, as, well, as, kurdish, muslim, tribes, who, had, substantial, christian, populations, living, amongst, them, a, significant, number, of, these, were, allegedly, originally, armenian, or, assyrian, and, it, has, been, recorded, that, a, small, number, of, christian, traditions, have, been, preserved, several, christian, prayers, in, kurdish, have, been, found, from, earlier, centuries, in, recent, years, some, kurds, from, muslim, backgrounds, have, converted, to, christianity, segments, of, the, bible, were, first,

to, the, 3rd, millennium, bc, this, land, was, inhabited, by, the, people, of, su, who, dwelt, in, the, southern, regions, of, lake, van, the, philological, connection, between, kurd, and, karda, is, uncertain, but, the, relationship, is, considered, possible, other, sumerian, clay, tablets, referred, to, the, people, who, lived, in, the, land, of, karda, as, the, qarduchi, karduchi, karduchoi, and, the, qurti, karda, qardu, is, etymologically, related, to, the, assyrian, term, urartu, and, the, hebrew, term, ararat, however, some, modern, scholars, do, not, believe, that, the, qarduchi, are, connected, to, kurds, qarti, or, qartas, who, were, originally, settled, on, the, mountains, north, of, mesopotamia, are, considered, as, a, probable, ancestor, of, the, kurds, the, akkadians, were, attacked, by, nomads, coming, through, qartas, territory, at, the, end, of, 3rd, millennium, bc, and, distinguished, them, as, the, guti, speakers, of, a, pre, iranic, language, isolate, they, conquered, mesopotamia, in, 2150, bc, and, ruled, with, 21, kings, until, defeated, by, the, sumerian, king, utu, hengal, many, kurds, consider, themselves, descended, from, the, medes, an, ancient, iranian, people, and, even, use, a, calendar, dating, from, 612, bc, when, the, assyrian, capital, of, nineveh, was, conquered, by, the, medes, the, claimed, median, descent, is, reflected, in, the, words, of, the, kurdish, national, anthem, we, are, the, children, of, the, medes, and, kai, khosrow, however, mackenzie, and, asatrian, challenge, the, relation, of, the, median, language, to, kurdish, the, kurdish, languages, on, the, other, hand, form, a, subgroup, of, the, northwestern, iranian, languages, like, median, some, researchers, consider, the, independent, kardouchoi, as, the, ancestors, of, the, kurds, while, others, prefer, cyrtians, the, term, kurd, however, is, first, encountered, in, arabic, sources, of, the, seventh, century, books, from, the, early, islamic, era, including, those, containing, legends, such, as, the, shahnameh, and, the, middle, persian, kar, namag, i, ardashir, i, pabagan, and, other, early, islamic, sources, provide, early, attestation, of, the, name, kurd, the, kurds, have, ethnically, diverse, origins, during, the, sassanid, era, in, kar, namag, i, ardashir, i, pabagan, a, short, prose, work, written, in, middle, persian, ardashir, i, is, depicted, as, having, battled, the, kurds, and, their, leader, madig, after, initially, sustaining, a, heavy, defeat, ardashir, i, was, successful, in, subjugating, the, kurds, in, a, letter, ardashir, i, received, from, his, foe, ardavan, v, which, is, also, featured, in, the, same, work, he, is, referred, to, as, being, a, kurd, himself, you, ve, bitten, off, more, than, you, can, chew, and, you, have, brought, death, to, yourself, o, son, of, a, kurd, raised, in, the, tents, of, the, kurds, who, gave, you, permission, to, put, a, crown, on, your, head, the, usage, of, the, term, kurd, during, this, time, period, most, likely, was, a, social, term, designating, northwestern, iranian, nomads, rather, than, a, concrete, ethnic, group, similarly, in, ad, 360, the, sassanid, king, shapur, ii, marched, into, the, roman, province, zabdicene, to, conquer, its, chief, city, bezabde, present, day, cizre, he, found, it, heavily, fortified, and, guarded, by, three, legions, and, a, large, body, of, kurdish, archers, after, a, long, and, hard, fought, siege, shapur, ii, breached, the, walls, conquered, the, city, and, massacred, all, its, defenders, thereafter, he, had, the,

the, byzantines, there, is, also, a, 7th, century, text, by, an, unidentified, author, written, about, the, legendary, christian, martyr, mar, qardagh, he, lived, in, the, 4th, century, during, the, reign, of, shapur, ii, and, during, his, travels, is, said, to, have, encountered, mar, abdisho, a, deacon, and, martyr, who, after, having, been, questioned, of, his, origins, by, mar, qardagh, and, his, marzobans, stated, that, his, parents, were, originally, from, an, assyrian, village, called, hazza, but, were, driven, out, and, subsequently, settled, in, tamanon, a, village, in, the, land, of, the, kurds, identified, as, being, in, the, region, of, mount, judi, early, syriac, sources, use, the, terms, hurdanaye, kurdanaye, kurdaye, to, refer, to, the, kurds, according, to, michael, the, syrian, hurdanaye, separated, from, tayaye, arabs, and, sought, refuge, with, the, byzantine, emperor, theophilus, he, also, mentions, the, persian, troops, who, fought, against, musa, chief, of, hurdanaye, in, the, region, of, qardu, in, 841, according, to, barhebreaus, a, king, appeared, to, the, kurdanaye, and, they, rebelled, against, the, arabs, in, 829, michael, the, syrian, considered, them, as, pagan, followers, of, mahdi, and, adepts, of, magianism, their, mahdi, called, himself, christ, and, the, holy, ghost, in, the, early, middle, ages, the, kurds, sporadically, appear, in, arabic, sources, though, the, term, was, still, not, being, used, for, a, specific, people, instead, it, referred, to, an, amalgam, of, nomadic, western, iranian, tribes, who, were, distinct, from, persians, however, in, the, high, middle, ages, the, kurdish, ethnic, identity, gradually, materialized, as, one, can, find, clear, evidence, of, the, kurdish, ethnic, identity, and, solidarity, in, texts, of, the, 12th, and, 13th, centuries, though, the, term, was, also, still, being, used, in, the, social, sense, since, 10th, century, arabic, texts, including, al, masudi, s, works, have, referred, to, kurds, as, a, distinct, linguistic, group, from, 11th, century, onward, the, term, kurd, is, explicitly, defined, as, an, ethnonym, and, this, does, not, suggest, synonymity, with, the, ethnographic, category, nomad, al, tabari, wrote, that, in, 639, hormuzan, a, sasanian, general, originating, from, a, noble, family, battled, against, the, islamic, invaders, in, khuzestan, and, called, upon, the, kurds, to, aid, him, in, battle, however, they, were, defeated, and, brought, under, islamic, rule, in, 838, a, kurdish, leader, based, in, mosul, named, mir, jafar, revolted, against, the, caliph, al, mu, tasim, who, sent, the, commander, itakh, to, combat, him, itakh, won, this, war, and, executed, many, of, the, kurds, eventually, arabs, conquered, the, kurdish, regions, and, gradually, converted, the, majority, of, kurds, to, islam, often, incorporating, them, into, the, military, such, as, the, hamdanids, whose, dynastic, family, members, also, frequently, intermarried, with, kurds, in, 934, the, daylamite, buyid, dynasty, was, founded, and, subsequently, conquered, most, of, present, day, iran, and, iraq, during, the, time, of, rule, of, this, dynasty, kurdish, chief, and, ruler, badr, ibn, hasanwaih, established, himself, as, one, of, the, most, important, emirs, of, the, time, in, the, 10th, 12th, centuries, a, number, of, kurdish, principalities,

iranian, boundaries, under, strong, influence, of, the, persian, language, the, kurds, sharing, much, of, their, history, with, the, rest, of, iran, is, seen, as, reason, for, why, kurdish, leaders, in, iran, do, not, want, a, separate, kurdish, state, the, government, of, iran, has, never, employed, the, same, level, of, brutality, against, its, own, kurds, like, turkey, or, iraq, but, it, has, always, been, implacably, opposed, to, any, suggestion, of, kurdish, separatism, during, and, shortly, after, the, first, world, war, the, government, of, iran, was, ineffective, and, had, very, little, control, over, events, in, the, country, and, several, kurdish, tribal, chiefs, gained, local, political, power, even, established, large, confederations, at, the, same, time, waves, of, nationalism, from, the, disintegrating, ottoman, empire, partly, influenced, some, kurdish, chiefs, in, border, regions, to, pose, as, kurdish, nationalist, leaders, prior, to, this, identity, in, both, countries, largely, relied, upon, religion, i, e, shia, islam, in, the, particular, case, of, iran, in, 19th, century, iran, shia, sunni, animosity, and, the, describing, of, sunni, kurds, as, an, ottoman, fifth, column, was, quite, frequent, during, the, late, 1910s, and, early, 1920s, tribal, revolt, led, by, kurdish, chieftain, simko, shikak, struck, north, western, iran, although, elements, of, kurdish, nationalism, were, present, in, this, movement, historians, agree, these, were, hardly, articulate, enough, to, justify, a, claim, that, recognition, of, kurdish, identity, was, a, major, issue, in, simko, s, movement, and, he, had, to, rely, heavily, on, conventional, tribal, motives, government, forces, and, non, kurds, were, not, the, only, ones, to, suffer, in, the, attacks, the, kurdish, population, was, also, robbed, and, assaulted, rebels, do, not, appear, to, have, felt, any, sense, of, unity, or, solidarity, with, fellow, kurds, kurdish, insurgency, and, seasonal, migrations, in, the, late, 1920s, along, with, long, running, tensions, between, tehran, and, ankara, resulted, in, border, clashes, and, even, military, penetrations, in, both, iranian, and, turkish, territory, two, regional, powers, have, used, kurdish, tribes, as, tool, for, own, political, benefits, turkey, has, provided, military, help, and, refuge, for, anti, iranian,

leaders, initiated, a, repressive, era, toward, non, iranian, minorities, government, s, forced, detribalization, and, sedentarization, in, 1920s, and, 1930s, resulted, with, many, other, tribal, revolts, in, iranian, regions, of, azerbaijan, luristan, and, kurdistan, in, particular, case, of, the, kurds, this, repressive, policies, partly, contributed, to, developing, nationalism, among, some, tribes, as, a, response, to, growing, pan, turkism, and, pan, arabism, in, region, which, were, seen, as, potential, threats, to, the, territorial, integrity, of, iran, pan, iranist, ideology, has, been, developed, in, the, early, 1920s, some, of, such, groups, and, journals, openly, advocated, iranian, support, to, the, kurdish, rebellion, against, turkey, secular, pahlavi, dynasty, has, endorsed, iranian, ethnic, nationalism, which, saw, the, kurds, as, integral, part, of, the, iranian, nation, mohammad, reza, pahlavi, has, personally, praised, the, kurds, as, pure, iranians, or, one, of, the, most, noble, iranian, peoples, another, significant, ideology, during, this, period, was, marxism, which, arose, among, kurds, under, influence, of, ussr, it, culminated, in, the, iran, crisis, of, 1946, which, included, a, separatist, attempt, of, kdp, i, and, communist, groups, to, establish, the, soviet, puppet, government, called, republic, of, mahabad, it, arose, along, with, azerbaijan, people, s, government, another, soviet, puppet, state, the, state, itself, encompassed, a, very, small, territory, including, mahabad, and, the, adjacent, cities, unable, to, incorporate, the, southern, iranian, kurdistan, which, fell, inside, the, anglo, american, zone, and, unable, to, attract, the, tribes, outside, mahabad, itself, to, the, nationalist, cause, as, a, result, when, the, soviets, withdrew, from, iran, in, december, 1946, government, forces, were, able, to, enter, mahabad, unopposed, several, nationalist, and, marxist, insurgencies, continued, for, decades, 1967, 1979, 1989, 96, led, by, kdp, i, and, komalah, but, those, two, organization, have, never, advocated, a, separate, kurdish, state, or, greater, kurdistan, as, did, the, pkk, in, turkey, still, many, of, dissident, leaders, among, others, qazi, muhammad, and, abdul, rahman, ghassemlou, were, executed, or, assassinated, during, iran, iraq, war, tehran, has, provided, support, for, iraqi, based, kurdish, groups, like, kdp, or, puk, along, with, asylum, for, 1, 4, million, iraqi, refugees, mostly, kurds, kurdish, marxist, groups, have, been, marginalized, in, iran, since, the, dissolution, of, the, soviet, union, in, 2004, new, insurrection, started, by, pjak, separatist, organization, affiliated, with, the, turkey, based, pkk, and, designated, as, terrorist, by, iran, turkey, and, the,

helped, to, undermine, claims, of, discrimination, some, of, the, more, influential, kurdish, politicians, during, recent, years, include, former, first, vice, president, mohammad, reza, rahimi, and,

switzerland, and, france, during, the, 1960s, successive, periods, of, political, and, social, turmoil, in, the, region, during, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, brought, new, waves, of, kurdish, refugees, mostly, from, iran, and, iraq, under, saddam, hussein, came, to, europe, in, recent, years, many, kurdish, asylum, seekers, from, both, iran, and, iraq, have, settled, in, the, united, kingdom, especially, in, the, town, of, dewsbury, and, in, some, northern, areas, of, london, which, has, sometimes, caused, media, controversy, over, their, right, to, remain, there, have, been, tensions, between, kurds, and, the, established, muslim, community, in, dewsbury, which, is, home, to, very, traditional, mosques, such, as, the, markazi, since, the, beginning, of, the, turmoil, in, syria, many, of, the, refugees, of, the, syrian, civil, war, are, syrian, kurds, and, as, a, result, many, of, the, current, syrian, asylum, seekers, in, germany, are, of, kurdish, descent, there, was, substantial, immigration, of, ethnic, kurds, in, canada, and, the, united, states, who, are, mainly, political, refugees, and, immigrants, seeking, economic, opportunity, according, to, a, 2011,

estimated, by, the, us, census, bureau, to, be, 20, 591, other, sources, claim, that, there, are, 20, 000, ethnic, kurds, in, the, united, states, kurdish, culture, is, a, legacy, from, the, various, ancient, peoples, who, shaped, modern, kurds, and, their, society, as, most, other, middle, eastern, populations, a, high, degree, of, mutual, influences, between, the, kurds, and, their, neighbouring, peoples, are, apparent, therefore, in, kurdish, culture, elements, of, various, other, cultures, are, to, be, seen, however, on, the, whole, kurdish, culture, is, closest, to, that, of, other, iranian, peoples, in, particular, those, who, historically, had, the, closest, geographical, proximity, to, the, kurds, such, as, the, persians, and, lurs, kurds, for, instance, also, celebrate, newroz, 21, march, as, new, year, s, day, a, madrasa, system, was, used, before, the, modern, era, mele, are, islamic, clerics, and, instructors, in, general, kurdish, women, s, rights, and, equality, have, improved, in, the, 20th, and, 21st, centuries, due, to, progressive, movements, within, kurdish, society, however, despite, the, progress, kurdish, and, international, women, s, rights, organizations, still, report, problems, related, to, gender, equality, forced, marriages, honor, killings, and, in, iraqi, kurdistan, also, female, genital, mutilation, fgm, the, kurds, possess, a, rich, tradition, of, folklore, which, until, recent, times, was, largely, transmitted, by, speech, or, song, from, one, generation, to, the, next, although, some, of, the, kurdish, writers, stories, were, well, known, throughout, kurdistan, most, of, the, stories, told, and, sung, were, only, written, down, in, the, 20th, and, 21st, centuries, many, of, these, are, allegedly, centuries, old, widely, varying, in, purpose, and, style, among, the, kurdish, folklore, one, will, find, stories, about, nature, anthropomorphic, animals, love, heroes, and, villains, mythological, creatures, and, everyday, life, a, number, of, these, mythological, figures, can, be, found, in, other, cultures, like, the, simurgh, and, kaveh, the, blacksmith, in, the, broader, iranian, mythology, and, stories, of, shahmaran, throughout, anatolia, additionally, stories, can, be, purely, entertaining, or, have, an, educational, or, religious, aspect, perhaps, the, most, widely, reoccurring, element, is, the, fox, which, through, cunning, and, shrewdness, triumphs, over, less, intelligent, species, yet, often, also, meets, his, demise, another, common, theme, in, kurdish, folklore, is, the, origin, of, a, tribe, storytellers, would, perform, in, front, of, an, audience, sometimes, consisting, of, an, entire, village, people, from, outside, the, region, would, travel, to, attend, their, narratives, and, the, storytellers, themselves, would, visit, other, villages, to, spread, their, tales, these, would, thrive, especially, during, winter, where, entertainment, was, hard, to, find, as, evenings, had, to, be, spent, inside, coinciding, with, the, heterogeneous, kurdish, groupings, although, certain, stories, and, elements, were, commonly, found, throughout, kurdistan, others, were, unique, to, a, specific, area, depending, on, the, region, religion, or, dialect, the, kurdish, jews, of, zakho, are, perhaps, the, best, example, of, this, their, gifted, storytellers, are, known, to, have, been, greatly, respected, throughout, the, region, thanks, to, a, unique, oral, tradition, other, examples, are, the, mythology, of, the, yezidis, and, the, stories, of, the, dersim, kurds, which, had, a, substantial, armenian, influence, during, the, criminalization, of, the, kurdish, language, after, the, coup, d, tat, of, 1980, dengb, j, singers, and, rokb, j, tellers, were, silenced, and, many, of, the, stories, had, become, endangered, in, 1991, the, language, was, decriminalized, yet, the, now, highly, available, radios, and, tv, s, had, as, an, effect, a, diminished, interest, in, traditional, storytelling, however, a, number, of, writers, have, made, great, strides, in, the, preservation, of, these, tales, kurdish, weaving, is, renowned, throughout, the, world, with, fine, specimens, of, both, rugs, and, bags, the, most, famous, kurdish, rugs, are, those, from, the, bijar, region, in, the, kurdistan, province, because, of, the, unique, way, in, which, the, bijar, rugs, are, woven, they, are, very, stout, and, durable, hence, their, appellation, as, the, iron, rugs, of, persia, exhibiting, a, wide, variety, the, bijar, rugs, have, patterns, ranging, from, floral, designs, medallions, and, animals, to, other, ornaments, they, generally, have, two, wefts, and, are, very, colorful, in, design, with, an, increased, interest, in, these, rugs, in, the, last, century, and, a, lesser, need, for, them, to, be, as, sturdy, as, they, were, new, bijar, rugs, are, more, refined, and, delicate, in, design, another, well, known, kurdish, rug, is, the, senneh, rug, which, is, regarded, as, the, most, sophisticated, of, the, kurdish, rugs, they, are, especially, known, for, their, great, knot, density, and, high, quality, mountain, wool, they, lend, their, name, from, the, region, of, sanandaj, throughout, other, kurdish, regions, like, kermanshah, siirt, malatya, and, bitlis, rugs, were, also, woven, to, great, extent, kurdish, bags, are, mainly, known, from, the, works, of, one, large, tribe, the, jaffs, living, in, the, border, area, between, iran, and, iraq, these, jaff, bags, share, the, same, characteristics, of, kurdish, rugs, very, colorful, stout, in, design, often, with, medallion, patterns, they, were, especially, popular, in, the, west, during, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, outside, of, weaving, and, clothing, there, are, many, other, kurdish, handicrafts, which, were, traditionally, often, crafted, by, nomadic, kurdish, tribes, these, are, especially, well, known, in, iran, most, notably, the, crafts, from, the, kermanshah, and, sanandaj, regions, among, these, crafts, are, chess, boards, talismans, jewelry, ornaments, weaponry, instruments, etc, kurdish, blades, include, a, distinct, jambiya, with, its,

horn, hilt, furthermore, they, are, often, still, worn, decoratively, by, older, men, swords, were, made, as, well, most, of, these, blades, in, circulation, stem, from, the, 19th, century, another, distinct, form, of, art, from, sanandaj, is, oroosi, a, type, of, window, where, stylized, wooden, pieces, are, locked, into, each, other, rather, than, being, glued, together, these, are, further, decorated, with, coloured, glass, this, stems, from, an, old, belief, that, if, light, passes, through, a, combination, of, seven, colours, it, helps, keep, the, atmosphere, clean, among, kurdish, jews, a, common, practice, was, the, making, of, talismans, which, were, believed, to, combat, illnesses, and, protect, the, wearer, from, malevolent, spirits, adorning, the, body, with, tattoos, deq,

enhancement, and, the, showing, of, tribal, affiliations, religious, symbolism, is, also, common, among, both, traditional, and, modern, kurdish, tattoos, tattoos, are, more, prevalent, among, women, than, among, men, and, were, generally, worn, on, feet, the, chin, foreheads, and, other, places, of, the, body, the, popularity, of, permanent, traditional, tattoos, has, greatly, diminished, among,

mtdna, hv1, sequences, eleven, y, chromosome, bi, allelic, markers, and, 9, y, str, loci, were, analyzed, to, investigate, lineage, relationship, among, kurdish, groups, when, both, mtdna, and, y, chromosome, data, are, compared, with, those, of, the, european, caucasian, west, asian, and, central, asian, groups, it, has, been, determined, that, the, kurdish, groups, are, most, closely, related, to, west, asians, and, the, furthest, to, central, asians, among, the, european, and, caucasian, groups, kurds, were, found, to, be, closer, to, europeans, than, caucasians, when, considering, mtdna, and, the, opposite, was, true, for, y, chromosome, this, indicates, a, difference, in, maternal, and, paternal, origins, of, kurdish, groups, according, to, the, study, kurdish, groups, in, georgia, went, through, a, genetic, bottleneck, while, migrating, to, the, caucasus, it, has, also, been, revealed, that, these, groups, were, not, influenced, by, other, caucasian, groups, in, terms, of, ancestry, another, phenomenon, found, in, the, research, was, that, zazas, are, closer, to, kurdish, groups, rather, than, peoples, of, northern, iran, where, ancestral, zaza, language, hypothesized, to, be, spoken, before, its, spread, to, anatolia, 11, different, y, dna, haplogroups, have, been, identified, in, kurmanji, speaking, kurds, in, turkey, haplogroup, i, m170, was, the, most, prevalent, with, 16, 1, of, the, samples, belonging, to, it, followed, by, haplogroups, j, m172, 13, 8, r1a1, 12, 7, k, 12, 7, e, 11, 5, and, f, 11, 5, p1, 8, p, 5, 7, r1, 4, 6, g, 2, 3, and, c, 1, 1, haplogroups, were, also, present, in, lower, proportions, y, dna, haplogroup, diversity, were, determined, to, be, much, lower, among, georgian, kurds, as, 5, haplogroups, were, discovered, in, total, where, the, dominant, haplogroups, were, p1, 44, and, j, m172, 32, the, lowest, y, dna, haplogroup, diversity, was, observed, in, turkmenistan, kurds, with, only, 4, haplogroups, in, total, f, 41, and, r1, 29, were, dominant, in, this, population
