language, both, terms, espa, ol, and, castellano, are, regarded, as, synonymous, and, equally, valid, the, term, castellano, is, related, to, castile, castilla, or, archaically, castiella, the,

name, for, the, entire, iberian, peninsula, there, are, other, hypotheses, apart, from, the, one, suggested, by, the, royal, spanish, academy, spanish, philologist, ram, n, men, ndez, pidal, suggested, that, the, classic, hispanus, or, hispanicus, took, the, suffix, one, from, vulgar, latin, as, happened, with, other, words, such, as, bret, n, breton, or, saj, n, saxon, like, the, other, romance, languages, the, spanish, language, evolved, from, vulgar, latin, which, was, brought, to, the, iberian, peninsula, by, the, romans, during, the, second, punic, war, beginning, in, 210, bc, several, pre, roman, languages, also, called, paleohispanic, languages, some, distantly, related, to, latin, as, indo, european, languages, and, some, that, are, not, related, at, all, were, previously, spoken, in, the, iberian, peninsula, these, languages, included, proto, basque, iberian, lusitanian, celtiberian, and, gallaecian, the, first, documents, to, show, traces, of, what, is, today, regarded, as, the, precursor, of, modern, spanish, are, from, the, 9th, century, throughout, the, middle, ages, and, into, the, modern, era, the, most, important, influences, on, the, spanish, lexicon, came, from, neighboring, romance, languages, mozarabic, andalusi, romance, navarro, aragonese, leonese, catalan, valencian, portuguese, galician, occitan, and, later, french, and, italian, spanish, also, borrowed, a, considerable, number, of, words, from, arabic, and, basque, as, well, as, a, minor, number, from, the, germanic, gothic, language, through, the, period, of, visigoth, rule, in, iberia, in, addition, many, more, words, were, borrowed, from, latin, through, the, influence, of, written, language, and, the, liturgical, language, of, the, church, the, loanwords, were, taken, from, both, classical, latin, and, renaissance, latin, the, form, of, latin, in, use, at, that, time, according, to, the, theories, of, ram, n, men, ndez, pidal, local, sociolects, of, vulgar, latin, evolved, into, spanish, in, the, north, of, iberia, in, an, area, centered, in, the, city, of, burgos, and, this, dialect, was, later, brought, to, the, city, of, toledo, where, the, written, standard, of, spanish, was, first, developed, in, the, 13th, century, in, this, formative, stage, spanish, developed, a, strongly, differing, variant, from, its, close, cousin, leonese, and, according, to, some, authors, was, distinguished, by, a, heavy, basque, influence, see, iberian, romance, languages, this, distinctive, dialect, spread, to, southern, spain, with, the, advance, of, the, reconquista, and, meanwhile, gathered, a, sizable, lexical, influence, from, the, arabic, of, al, andalus, much, of, it, indirectly, through, the, romance, mozarabic, dialects, some, 4, 000, arabic, derived, words, make, up, around, 8, of, the, language, today, the, written, standard, for, this, new, language, was, developed, in, the, cities, of, toledo, in, the, 13th, to, 16th, centuries, and, madrid, from, the, 1570s, the, development, of, the, spanish, sound, system, from, that, of, vulgar, latin, exhibits, most, of, the, changes, that, are, typical, of, western, romance, languages, including, lenition, of, intervocalic, consonants, thus, latin, v, ta, spanish, vida, the, diphthongization, of, latin, stressed, short, e, and, o, which, occurred, in, open, syllables, in, french, and, italian, but, not, at, all, in, catalan, or, portuguese, is, found, in, both, open, and, closed, syllables, in, spanish, as, shown, in, the, following, table, spanish, is, marked, by, palatalization, of, the, latin, double, consonants, geminates, nn, and, ll, thus, latin, annum, spanish, a, o, and, latin, anellum, spanish, anillo, the, consonant, written, u, or, v, in, latin, and, pronounced, in, classical, latin, had, probably, fortified, to, a, bilabial, fricative, in, vulgar, latin, in, early, spanish, but, not, in, catalan, or, portuguese, it, merged, with, the, consonant, written, b, a, bilabial, with, plosive, and, fricative, allophones, in, modern, spanish, there, is, no, difference, between, the, pronunciation, of, orthographic, b, and, v, typical, of, spanish, as, also, of, neighboring, gascon, extending, as, far, north, as, the, gironde, estuary, and, found, in, a, small, area, of, calabria, attributed, by, some, scholars, to, a, basque, substratum, was, the, mutation, of, latin, initial, f, into, h, whenever, it, was, followed, by, a, vowel, that, did, not, diphthongize, the, h, still, preserved, in, spelling, is, now, silent, in, most, varieties, of, the, language, although, in, some, andalusian, and, caribbean, dialects, it, is, still, aspirated, in, some, words, because, of, borrowings, from, latin, and, neighboring, romance, languages, there, are, many, f, h, doublets, in, modern, spanish, fernando, and, hernando, both, spanish, for, ferdinand, ferrero, and, herrero, both, spanish, for, smith, fierro, and, hierro, both, spanish, for, iron,

latin, also, produced, characteristically, different, results, in, these, languages, as, shown, in, the, examples, in, the, following, table, in, the, 15th, and, 16th, centuries, spanish, underwent, a, dramatic, change, in, the, pronunciation, of, its, sibilant, consonants, known, in, spanish, as, the, reajuste, de, las, sibilantes, which, resulted, in, the, distinctive, velar, pronunciation, of,

inflection, of, nouns, for, case, and, usually, though, not, always, places, adjectives, after, nouns, as, do, most, other, romance, languages, spanish, is, classified, as, a, subject, verb, object, language, however, as, in, most, romance, languages, constituent, order, is, highly, variable, and, governed, mainly, by, topicalization, and, focus, it, is, a, pro, drop, or, null, subject, language, that, is, it, allows, the, deletion, of, subject, pronouns, when, they, are, pragmatically, unnecessary, spanish, is, described, as, a, verb, framed, language, meaning, that, the, direction, of, motion, is, expressed, in, the, verb, while, the, mode, of, locomotion, is, expressed, adverbially, e, g, subir, corriendo, or, salir, volando, the, respective, english, equivalents, of, these, examples, to, run, up, and, to, fly, out, show, that, english, is, by, contrast, satellite, framed, with, mode, of, locomotion, expressed, in, the, verb, and, direction, in, an, adverbial, modifier, the, spanish, phonological, system, evolved, from, that, of, vulgar, latin, its, development, exhibits, some, traits, in, common, with, other, western, romance, languages, others, with, the, neighboring, hispanic, varieties, especially, leonese, and, aragonese, as, well, as, other, features, unique, to, spanish, spanish, is, alone, among, its, immediate, neighbors, in, having, undergone, frequent, aspiration, and, eventual, loss, of, the, latin, initial, f, sound, e, g, cast, harina, vs, leon, and, arag, farina, the, latin, initial, consonant, sequences, pl, cl, and, fl, in, spanish,

17, to, 19, consonant, phonemes, the, exact, number, depending, on, the, dialect, the, main, allophonic, variation, among, vowels, is, the, reduction, of, the, high, vowels, i, and, u, to, glides,

and, rising, tone, for, yes, no, questions, there, are, no, syntactic, markers, to, distinguish, between, questions, and, statements, and, thus, the, recognition, of, declarative, or, interrogative, depends, entirely, on, intonation, stress, most, often, occurs, on, any, of, the, last, three, syllables, of, a, word, with, some, rare, exceptions, at, the, fourth, to, last, or, earlier, syllables, stress, tends, to, occur, as, follows, in, addition, to, the, many, exceptions, to, these, tendencies, there, are, numerous, minimal, pairs, that, contrast, solely, on, stress, such, as, s, bana,

of, spanish, involve, differing, uses, of, pronouns, especially, those, of, the, second, person, and, to, a, lesser, extent, the, object, pronouns, of, the, third, person, virtually, all, dialects, of, spanish, make, the, distinction, between, a, formal, and, a, familiar, register, in, the, second, person, singular, and, thus, have, two, different, pronouns, meaning, you, usted, in, the, formal, and, either, t, or, vos, in, the, familiar, and, each, of, these, three, pronouns, has, its, associated, verb, forms, with, the, choice, of, t, or, vos, varying, from, one, dialect, to, another, the, use, of, vos, and, its, verb, forms, is, called, voseo, in, a, few, dialects, all, three, pronouns, are, used, with, usted, t, and, vos, denoting, respectively, formality, familiarity, and, intimacy, in, voseo, vos, is, the, subject, form, vos, dec, s, you, say, and, the, form, for, the, object, of, a, preposition, voy, con, vos, i, am, going, with, you, while, the, direct, and, indirect, object, forms, and, the, possessives, are, the, same, as, those, associated, with, t, vos, sab, s, que, tus, amigos, te, respetan, you, know, your, friends, respect, you, the, verb, forms, of, the, general, voseo, are, the, same, as, those, used, with, t, except, in, the, present, tense, indicative, and, imperative, verbs, the, forms, for, vos, generally, can, be, derived, from, those, of, vosotros, the, traditional, second, person, familiar, plural, by, deleting, the, glide, or, d, where, it, appears, in, the, ending, vosotros, pens, i, s, vos, pens, s, vosotros, volv, i, s, vos, volv, s, pensa, d,

are, distinct, from, the, corresponding, standard, t, forms, the, use, of, the, pronoun, vos, with, the, verb, forms, of, t, vos, piensas, is, called, pronominal, voseo, conversely, the, use, of, the, verb, forms, of, vos, with, the, pronoun, t, t, pens, s, or, t, pens, i, is, called, verbal, voseo, in, chile, for, example, verbal, voseo, is, much, more, common, than, the, actual, use, of, the, pronoun, vos, which, is, usually, reserved, for, highly, informal, situations, although, vos, is, not, used, in, spain, it, occurs, in, many, spanish, speaking, regions, of, the, americas, as, the, primary, spoken, form, of, the, second, person, singular, familiar, pronoun, with, wide, differences, in, social, consideration, generally, it, can, be, said, that, there, are, zones, of, exclusive, use, of, tuteo, the, use, of, t, in, the, following, areas, almost, all, of, mexico, the, west, indies, panama, most, of, colombia, peru, venezuela, and, coastal, ecuador, tuteo, as, a, cultured, form, alternates, with, voseo, as, a, popular, or, rural, form, in, bolivia, in, the, north, and, south, of, peru, in, andean, ecuador, in, small, zones, of, the, venezuelan, andes, and, most, notably, in, the, venezuelan, state, of, zulia, and, in, a, large, part, of, colombia, some, researchers, maintain, that, voseo, can, be, heard, in, some, parts, of, eastern, cuba, and, others, assert, that, it, is, absent, from, the, island, tuteo, exists, as, the, second, person, usage, with, an, intermediate, degree, of, formality, alongside, the, more, familiar, voseo, in, chile, in,

person, plural, is, sometimes, heard, in, andalusia, but, it, is, non, standard, usted, is, the, usual, second, person, singular, pronoun, in, a, formal, context, but, it, is, used, jointly, with, the, third, person, singular, voice, of, the, verb, it, is, used, to, convey, respect, toward, someone, who, is, a, generation, older, or, is, of, higher, authority, you, sir, you, ma, am, it, is, also, used, in, a, familiar, context, by, many, speakers, in, colombia, and, costa, rica, and, in, parts, of, ecuador, and, panama, to, the, exclusion, of, t, or, vos, this, usage, is, sometimes, called, ustedeo, in, spanish, in, central, america, especially, in, honduras, usted, is, often, used, as, a, formal, pronoun, to, convey, respect, between, the, members, of, a, romantic, couple,

can, be, significantly, different, in, different, hispanophone, countries, most, spanish, speakers, can, recognize, other, spanish, forms, even, in, places, where, they, are, not, commonly, used, but, spaniards, generally, do, not, recognize, specifically, american, usages, for, example, spanish, mantequilla, aguacate, and, albaricoque, respectively, butter, avocado, apricot, correspond, to, manteca, word, used, for, lard, in, peninsular, spanish, palta, and, damasco, respectively, in, argentina, chile, except, manteca, paraguay, peru, except, manteca, and, damasco, and, uruguay, in, the,

from, latin, the, spanish, words, first, learned, by, children, as, they, learn, to, speak, are, mainly, words, of, latin, origin, these, words, of, latin, origin, can, be, classified, as, heritage, words, cultisms, and, semi, cultisms, most, of, the, spanish, lexicon, is, made, up, of, heritage, lexicon, heritage, or, directly, inherited, words, are, those, whose, presence, in, the, spoken, language, has, been, continued, since, before, the, differentiation, of, the, romance, languages, heritage, words, are, characterized, by, having, undergone, all, the, phonetic, changes, experienced, by, the, language, this, differentiates, it, from, the, cultisms, and, semi, cultisms, that, were, no, longer, used, in, the, spoken, language, and, were, later, reintroduced, for, restricted, uses, because, of, this, cultisms, generally, have, not, experienced, some, of, the, phonetic, changes, and, present, a, different, form, than, they, would, have, if, they, had, been, transmitted, with, heritage, words, in, the, philological, tradition, of, spanish, cultism, is, called, a, word, whose, morphology, very, strictly, follows, its, greek, or, latin, etymological, origin, without, undergoing, the, changes, that, the, evolution, of, the, spanish, language, followed, from, its, origin, in, vulgar, latin, the, same, concept, also, exists, in, other, romance, languages, reintroduced, into, the, language, for, cultural, literary, or, scientific, considerations, cultism, only, adapts, its, form, to, the, orthographic, and, phonological, conventions, derived, from, linguistic, evolution, but, ignores, the, transformations, that, the, roots, and, morphemes, underwent, in, the, development, of, the, romance, language, in, some, cases, cultisms, are, used, to, introduce, technical, or, specialized, terminology, that, present, in, the, classical, language, did, not, appear, in, the, romance, language, due, to, lack, of, use, this, is, the, case, of, many, of, the, literary, legal, and, philosophical, terms, of, classical, culture, such, as, ataraxia, from, the, greek, dispassion, or, legislar, built, from, the, latin, legislator, in, other, cases, they, construct, neologisms, such, as, the, name, of, most, scientific, disciplines, a, semi, cultism, is, a, word, that, did, not, evolve, in, the, expected, way, in, the, vernacular, language, romance, language, unlike, heritage, words, its, evolution, is, incomplete, many, times, interrupted, by, cultural, influences, ecclesiastical, legal, administrative, etc, for, the, same, reason, they, maintain, some, features, of, the, language, of, origin, dios, is, a, clear, example, of, semi, cultism, where, it, came, from, the, latin, deus, it, is, a, semi, cultism, because, it, maintains, without, fully, adapting, to, castilianization, in, this, case, some, characteristics, of, the, latin, language, the, ending, in, s, but, at, the, same, time, it, undergoes, slight, phonetic, modifications, change, of, eu, for, io, deus, dios, instead, of, remaining, cultist, deus, deus, or, becoming, a, heritage, word, deus, d, o, the, catholic, church, influenced, by, stopping, the, natural, evolution, of, this, word, and, in, this, way, converted, this, word, into, a, semi, cultism, and, unconsciously, prevented, it, from, becoming, a, heritage, word, spanish, vocabulary, has, been, influenced, by, several, languages, as, in, other, european, languages, classical, greek, words, hellenisms, are, abundant, in, the, terminologies, of, several, fields, including, art, science, politics, nature, etc, its, vocabulary, has, also, been, influenced, by, arabic, having, developed, during, the, al, andalus, era, in, the, iberian, peninsula, with, around, 8, of, its, vocabulary, having, arabic, lexical, roots, it, has, also, been, influenced, by, basque, iberian, celtiberian, visigothic, and, other, neighboring, ibero, romance, languages, additionally, it, has, absorbed, vocabulary, from, other, languages, particularly, other, romance, languages, such, as, french, mozarabic, portuguese, galician, catalan, occitan, and, sardinian, as, well, as, from, quechua, nahuatl, and, other, indigenous, languages, of, the, americas, in, the, 18th, century, words, taken, from, french, referring, above, all, to, fashion, cooking, and, bureaucracy, were, added, to, the, spanish, lexicon, in, the, 19th, century, new, loanwords, were, incorporated, especially, from, english, and, german, but, also, from, italian, in, areas, related, to, music, particularly, opera, and, cooking, in, the, 20th, century, the, pressure, of, english, in, the, fields, of, technology, computing, science, and, sports, was, greatly, accentuated, in, general, latin, america, is, more, susceptible, to, loanwords, from, english, or, anglicisms, for, example, mouse, computer, mouse, is, used, in, latin, america, in, spain, rat, n, is, used, this, happens, largely, due, to, closer, contact, with, the, united, states, for, its, part, spain, is, known, by, the, use, of, gallicisms, or, words, taken, from, neighboring, france, such, as, the, gallicism, ordenador, in, european, spanish, in, contrast, to, the, anglicism, computador, or, computadora, in, american, spanish, spanish, is, closely, related, to, the, other, west, iberian, romance, languages, including, asturian, aragonese, galician, ladino, leonese, mirandese, and, portuguese, it, is, somewhat, less, similar, to, varying, degrees, from, other, members, of, the, romance, language, family, it, is, generally, acknowledged, that, portuguese, and, spanish, speakers, can, communicate, in, written, form, with, varying, degrees, of, mutual, intelligibility, mutual, intelligibility, of, the, written, spanish, and, portuguese, languages, is, high, lexically, and, grammatically, ethnologue, gives, estimates, of, the, lexical, similarity, between, related, languages, in, terms, of, precise, percentages, for, spanish, and, portuguese, that, figure, is, 89, although, phonologically, the, two, languages, are, quite, dissimilar, italian, on, the, other, hand, is, phonologically, similar, to, spanish, while, sharing, lower, lexical, and, grammatical, similarity, of, 82, mutual, intelligibility, between, spanish, and, french, or, between, spanish, and, romanian, is, lower, still, given, lexical, similarity, ratings, of, 75, and, 71, respectively, comprehension, of, spanish, by, french, speakers, who, have, not, studied, the, language, is, much, lower, at, an, estimated, 45, in, general, thanks, to, the, common, features, of, the, writing, systems, of, the, romance, languages, interlingual, comprehension, of, the, written, word, is, greater, than, that, of, oral, communication, the, following, table, compares, the, forms, of, some, common, words, in, several, romance, languages, 1, in, romance, etymology, latin, terms, are, given, in, the, accusative, since, most, forms, derive,

variety, of, spanish, which, preserves, many, features, of, medieval, spanish, and, some, old, portuguese, and, is, spoken, by, descendants, of, the, sephardi, jews, who, were, expelled, from, spain, in, the, 15th, century, while, in, portugal, the, conversion, of, jews, occurred, earlier, and, the, assimilation, of, new, christians, was, overwhelming, in, spain, the, jews, kept, their, language, and, identity, the, relationship, of, ladino, and, spanish, is, therefore, comparable, with, that, of, the, yiddish, language, to, german, ladino, speakers, today, are, almost, exclusively, sephardi, jews, with, family, roots, in, turkey, greece, or, the, balkans, and, living, mostly, in, israel, turkey, and, the, united, states, with, a, few, communities, in, hispanic, america, judaeo, spanish, lacks, the, native, american, vocabulary, which, was, acquired, by, standard, spanish, during, the, spanish, colonial, period, and, it, retains, many, archaic, features, which, have, since, been, lost, in, standard, spanish, it, contains, however, other, vocabulary, which, is, not, found, in, standard, spanish, including, vocabulary, from, hebrew, french, greek, and, turkish, and, other, languages, spoken, where, the, sephardim, settled, judaeo, spanish, is, in, serious, danger, of, extinction, because, many, native, speakers, today, are, elderly, as, well, as, elderly, olim, immigrants, to, israel, who, have, not, transmitted, the, language, to, their, children, or, grandchildren, however, it, is, experiencing, a, minor, revival, among, sephardi, communities, especially, in, music, in, latin, american, communities, the, danger, of, extinction, is, also, due, to, assimilation, by, modern, spanish, a, related, dialect, is, haketia, the, judaeo, spanish, of, northern,
