a, war, crime, is, a, violation, of, the, laws, of, war, that, gives, rise, to, individual, criminal, responsibility, for, actions, by, combatants, in, action, such, as, intentionally, killing, civilians, or, intentionally, killing, prisoners, of, war, torture, taking, hostages, unnecessarily, destroying, civilian, property, deception, by, perfidy, wartime, sexual, violence, pillaging, and,

quarter, despite, surrender, the, conscription, of, children, in, the, military, and, flouting, the, legal, distinctions, of, proportionality, and, military, necessity, the, formal, concept, of, war, crimes, emerged, from, the, codification, of, the, customary, international, law, that, applied, to, warfare, between, sovereign, states, such, as, the, lieber, code, 1863, of, the, union, army, in, the, american, civil, war, and, the, hague, conventions, of, 1899, and, 1907, for, international, war, in, the, aftermath, of, the, second, world, war, the, war, crime, trials, of, the, leaders, of, the, axis, powers, established, the, nuremberg, principles, of, law, such, as, that, international, criminal, law, defines, what, is, a, war, crime, in, 1949, the, geneva, conventions, legally, defined, new, war, crimes, and, established, that, states, could, exercise, universal, jurisdiction, over, war, criminals, in, the, late, 20th, century, and, early, 21st, century, international, courts, extrapolated, and, defined, additional, categories, of, war, crimes, applicable, to, a, civil, war, in, 1474, the, first, trial, for, a, war, crime, was, that, of, peter, von, hagenbach, realised, by, an, ad, hoc, tribunal, of, the, holy, roman, empire, for, his, command, responsibility, for, the, actions, of, his, soldiers, because, he, as, a, knight, was, deemed, to, have, a, duty, to, prevent, criminal, behaviour, by, a, military, force, despite, having, argued, that, he, had, obeyed, superior, orders, von, hagenbach, was, convicted, condemned, to, death, and, beheaded, the, hague, conventions, were, international, treaties, negotiated, at, the, first, and, second, peace, conferences, at, the, hague, netherlands, in, 1899, and, 1907, respectively, and, were, along, with, the, geneva, conventions, among, the, first, formal, statements, of, the, laws, of, war, and, war, crimes, in, the, nascent, body, of, secular, international, law, the, lieber, code, was, written, early, in, the, american, civil, war, and, president, abraham, lincoln, issued, as, general, order, 100, on, april, 24, 1863, just, months, after, the, military, executions, at, mankato, minnesota, general, order, 100, instructions, for, the, government, of, the, armies, of, the, united, states, in, the, field, lieber, code, was, written, by, franz, lieber, a, german, lawyer, political, philosopher, and, veteran, of, the, napoleonic, wars, lincoln, made, the, code, military, law, for, all, wartime, conduct, of, the, union, army, it, defined, command, responsibility, for, war, crimes, and, crimes, against, humanity, as, well, as, stated, the, military, responsibilities, of, the, union, soldier, fighting, the, confederate, states, of, america, the, geneva, conventions, are, four, related, treaties, adopted, and, continuously, expanded, from, 1864, to, 1949, that, represent, a, legal, basis, and, framework, for, the, conduct, of, war, under, international, law, every, single, member, state, of, the, united, nations, has, currently, ratified, the, conventions, which, are, universally, accepted, as, customary, international, law, applicable, to, every, situation, of, armed, conflict, in, the, world, the, additional, protocols, to, the, geneva, conventions, adopted, in, 1977, containing, the, most, pertinent, detailed, and, comprehensive, protections, of, international, humanitarian, law, for, persons, and, objects, in, modern, warfare, are, still, not, ratified, by, several, states, continuously, engaged, in, armed, conflicts, namely, the, united, states, israel, india, pakistan, iraq, iran, and, others, accordingly, states, retain, different, codes, and, values, about, wartime, conduct, some, signatories, have, routinely, violated, the, geneva, conventions, in, a, way, that, either, uses, the, ambiguities, of, law, or, political, maneuvering, to, sidestep, the, laws, formalities, and, principles, the, first, three, conventions, have, been, revised, and, expanded, with, the, fourth, one, added, in, 1949, two, additional, protocols, were, adopted, in, 1977, with, the, third, one, added, in, 2005, completing, and, updating, the, geneva, conventions, just, after, wwi, world, governments, started, to, try, and, systematically, create, a, code, for, how, war, crimes, would, be, defined, their, first, outline, of, a, law, was, instructions, for, the, government, of, armies, of, the, united, states, in, the, field, also, known, as, the, lieber, code, a, small, number, of, german, military, personnel, of, the, first, world, war, were, tried, in, 1921, by, the, german, supreme, court, for, alleged, war, crimes, the, modern, concept, of, war, crime, was, further, developed, under, the, auspices, of, the, nuremberg, trials, based, on, the, definition, in, the, london, charter, that, was, published, on, august, 8, 1945, see, nuremberg, principles, along, with, war, crimes, the, charter, also, defined, crimes, against, peace, and, crimes, against, humanity, which, are, often, committed, during, wars, and, in, concert, with, war, crimes, also, known, as, the, tokyo, trial, the, tokyo, war, crimes, tribunal, or, simply, as, the, tribunal, it, was, convened, on, may, 3, 1946, to, try, the, leaders, of, the, empire, of, japan, for, three, types, of, crimes, class, a, crimes, against, peace, class, b, war, crimes, and, class, c, crimes, against, humanity, committed, during, world, war, ii, on, july, 1, 2002, the, international, criminal, court, icc, a, treaty, based, court, located, in, the, hague, came, into, being, for, the, prosecution, of, war, crimes, committed, on, or, after, that, date, several, nations, most, notably, the, united, states, china, russia, and, israel, have, criticized, the, court, the, united, states, still, participates, as, an, observer, article, 12, of, the, rome, statute, provides, jurisdiction, over, the, citizens, of, non, contracting, states, if, they, are, accused, of, committing, crimes, in, the, territory, of, one, of, the, state, parties, the, icc, only, has, jurisdiction, over, these, crimes, when, they, are, part, of, a, plan, or, policy, or, as, part, of, a, large, scale, commission, of, such, crimes, to, date, the, present, and, former, heads, of, state, and, heads, of, government, that, have, been, charged, with, war, crimes, include, war, crimes, are, serious, violations, of, the, rules, of, customary, and, treaty, law, concerning, international, humanitarian, law, criminal, offenses, for, which, there, is, individual, responsibility, colloquial, definitions, of, war, crime, include, violations, of, established, protections, of, the, laws, of, war, but, also, include, failures, to, adhere, to, norms, of, procedure, and, rules, of, battle, such, as, attacking, those, displaying, a, peaceful, flag, of, truce, or, using, that, same, flag, as, a, ruse, to, mount, an, attack, on, enemy, troops, the, use, of, chemical, and, biological, weapons, in, warfare, are, also, prohibited, by, numerous, chemical, arms, control, agreements, and, the, biological, weapons, convention, wearing, enemy, uniforms, or, civilian, clothes, to, infiltrate, enemy, lines, for, espionage, or, sabotage, missions, is, a, legitimate, ruse, of, war, though, fighting, in, combat, or, assassinating, individuals, behind, enemy, lines, while, so, disguised, is, not, as, it, constitutes, unlawful, perfidy, attacking, enemy, troops, while, they, are, being, deployed, by, way, of, a, parachute, is, not, a, war, crime, protocol, i, article, 42, of, the, geneva, conventions, explicitly, forbids, attacking, parachutists, who, eject, from, disabled, aircraft, and, surrendering, parachutists, once, landed, article, 30, of, the, 1907, hague, convention, iv, the, laws, and, customs, of, war, on, land, explicitly, forbids, belligerents, to, punish, enemy, spies, without, previous, trial, the, rule, of, war, also, known, as, the, law, of, armed, conflict, permits, belligerents, to, engage, in, combat, a, war, crime, occurs, when, superfluous, injury, or, unnecessary, suffering, is, inflicted, upon, an, enemy, war, crimes, also, include, such, acts, as, mistreatment, of, prisoners, of, war, or, civilians, war, crimes, are, sometimes, part, of, instances, of, mass, murder, and, genocide, though, these, crimes, are, more, broadly, covered, under, international, humanitarian, law, described, as, crimes, against, humanity, in, 2008, the, u, n, security, council, adopted, resolution, 1820, which, noted, that, rape, and, other, forms, of, sexual, violence, can, constitute, war, crimes, crimes, against, humanity, or, a, constitutive, act, with, respect, to, genocide, see, also, wartime, sexual, violence, in, 2016, the, international, criminal, court, convicted, someone, of, sexual, violence, for, the, first, time, specifically, they, added, rape, to, a, war, crimes, conviction, of, congo, vice, president, jean, pierre, bemba, gombo, war, crimes, also, included, deliberate, attacks, on, citizens, and, property, of, neutral, states, such, as, the, japanese, attack, on, pearl, harbor, as, the, attack, on, pearl, harbor, happened, while, the, u, s, and, japan, were, at, peace, and, without, a, just, cause, for, self, defense, the, attack, was, declared, by, the, tokyo, trials, to, go, beyond, justification, of, military, necessity, and, therefore, constituted, a, war, crime, war, crimes, are, significant, in, international, humanitarian, law, because, it, is, an, area, where, international, tribunals, such, as, the, nuremberg, trials, and, tokyo, trials, have, been, convened, recent, examples, are, the, international, criminal, tribunal, for, the, former, yugoslavia, and, the, international, criminal, tribunal, for, rwanda, which, were, established, by, the, un, security, council, acting, under, chapter, viii, of, the, un, charter, under, the, nuremberg, principles, war, crimes, are, different, from, crimes, against, peace, crimes, against, peace, include, planning, preparing, initiating, or, waging, a, war, of, aggression, or, a, war, in, violation, of, international, treaties, agreements, or, assurances, because, the, definition, of, a, state, of, war, may, be, debated, the, term, war, crime, itself, has, seen, different, usage, under, different, systems, of, international, and, military, law, it, has, some, degree, of, application, outside, of, what, some, may, consider, being, a, state, of, war, but, in, areas, where, conflicts, persist, enough, to, constitute, social, instability, the, legalities, of, war, have, sometimes, been, accused, of, containing, favoritism, toward, the, winners, victor, s, justice, as, some, controversies, have, not, been, ruled, as, war, crimes, some, examples, include, the, allies, destruction, of, axis, cities, during, world, war, ii, such, as, the, firebombing, of, dresden, the, operation, meetinghouse, raid, on, tokyo, the, most, destructive, single, bombing, raid, in, history, and, the, atomic, bombings, of, hiroshima, and, nagasaki, in, regard, to, the, strategic, bombing, during, world, war, ii, there, was, no, international, treaty, or, instrument, protecting, a, civilian, population, specifically, from, attack, by, aircraft, therefore, the, aerial, attacks, on, civilians, were, not, officially, war, crimes, the, allies, at, the, trials, in, nuremberg, and, tokyo, never, prosecuted, the, germans, including, luftwaffe, commander, in, chief, hermann, g, ring, for, the, bombing, raids, on, warsaw, rotterdam, and, british, cities, during, the, blitz, as, well, as, the, indiscriminate, attacks, on, allied, cities, with, v, 1, flying, bombs, and, v, 2, rockets, nor, the, japanese, for, the, aerial, attacks, on, crowded, chinese, cities, controversy, arose, when, the, allies, re, designated, german, pows, under, the, protection, of, the, 1929, geneva, convention, on, prisoners, of, war, as, disarmed, enemy, forces, allegedly, unprotected, by, the, 1929, geneva, convention, on, prisoners, of, war, many, of, which, were, then, used, for, forced, labor, such, as, clearing, minefields, by, december, 1945, six, months, after, the, war, had, ended, it, was, estimated, by, french, authorities, that, 2, 000, german, prisoners, were, still, being, killed, or, maimed, each, month, in, mine, clearing, accidents, the, wording, of, the, 1949, third, geneva, convention, was, intentionally, altered, from, that, of, the, 1929, convention, so, that, soldiers, who, fall, into, the, power, following, surrender, or, mass, capitulation, of, an, enemy, are, now, protected, as, well, as, those, taken, prisoner, in, the, course, of, fighting, the, united, nations, defines, war, crimes, as, described, in, article, 8, of, the, rome, statute, the, treaty, that, established, the, international, criminal, court, under, the, law, of, armed, conflict, loac, the, death, of, non, combatants, is, not, necessarily, a, violation, there, are, many, things, to, take, into, account, civilians, cannot, be, made, the, object, of, an, attack, but, the, death, injury, of, civilians, while, conducting, an, attack, on, a, military, objective, are, governed, under, principles, such, as, of, proportionality, and, military, necessity, and, can, be, permissible, military, necessity, permits, the, destruction, of, life, of, persons, whose, destruction, is, incidentally, unavoidable, by, the, armed, conflicts, of, the, war, it, does, not, permit, the, killing, of, innocent, inhabitants, for, purposes, of, revenge, or, the, satisfaction, of, a, lust, to, kill, the, destruction, of, property, to, be, lawful, must, be, imperatively, demanded, by, the, necessities, of, war, for, example, conducting, an, operation, on, an, ammunition, depot, or, a, terrorist, training, camp, would, not, be, prohibited, because, a, farmer, is, plowing, a, field, in, the, area, the, farmer, is, not, the, object, of, attack, and, the, operations, would, adhere, to, proportionality, and, military, necessity, on, the, other, hand, an, extraordinary, military, advantage, would, be, necessary, to, justify, an, operation, posing, risks, of, collateral, death, or, injury, to, thousands, of, civilians, in, grayer, cases, the, legal, question, of, whether, the, expected, incidental, harm, is, excessive, may, be, very, subjective, for, this, reason, states, have, chosen, to, apply, a, clearly, excessive, standard, for, determining, whether, a, criminal, violation, has, occurred, when, there, is, no, justification, for, military, action, such, as, civilians, being, made, the, object, of, attack, a, proportionality, analysis, is, unnecessary, to, conclude, that, the, attack, is, unlawful, for, aerial, strikes, pilots, generally, have, to, rely, on, information, supplied, by, external, sources, headquarters, ground, troops, that, a, specific, position, is, in, fact, a, military, target, in, the, case, of, former, yugoslavia, nato, pilots, hit, a, civilian, object, the, chinese, embassy, in, belgrade, that, was, of, no, military, significance, but, the, pilots, had, no, idea, of, determining, it, aside, from, their, orders, the, committee, ruled, that, the, aircrew, involved, in, the, attack, should, not, be, assigned, any, responsibility, for, the, fact, they, were, given, the, wrong, target, and, that, it, is, inappropriate, to, attempt, to, assign, criminal, responsibility, for, the, incident, to, senior, leaders, because, they, were, provided, with, wrong, information, by, officials, of, another, agency, the, report, also, notes, that, much, of, the, material, submitted, to, the, otp, consisted, of, reports, that, civilians, had, been, killed, often, inviting, the, conclusion, to, be, drawn, that, crimes, had, therefore, been, committed, collateral, casualties, to, civilians, and, collateral, damage, to, civilian, objects, can, occur, for, a, variety, of, reasons, the, rendulic, rule, is, a, standard, by, which, commanders, are, judged, german, general, lothar, rendulic, was, charged, for, ordering, extensive, destruction, of, civilian, buildings, and, lands, while, retreating, from, a, suspected, enemy, attack, in, what, is, called, scorched, earth, policy, for, the, military, purpose, of, denying, the, use, of, ground, for, the, enemy, the, german, troops, retreating, from, finnish, lapland, believed, finland, would, be, occupied, by, soviet, troops, and, destroyed, many, settlements, while, retreating, to, norway, under, the, command, of, rendulic, he, overestimated, the, perceived, risk, but, argued, that, hague, iv, authorized, the, destruction, because, it, was, necessary, to, war, he, was, acquitted, of, that, charge, under, the, rendulic, rule, persons, must, assess, the, military, necessity, of, an, action, based, on, the, information, available, to, them, at, that, time, they, cannot, be, judged, based, on, information, that, subsequently, comes, to, light
