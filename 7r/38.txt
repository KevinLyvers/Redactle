https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly
a, monopoly, from, greek, m, nos, single, alone, and, p, le, n, to, sell, as, described, by, irving, fisher, is, a, market, with, the, absence, of, competition, creating, a, situation, where, a, specific, person, or, enterprise, is, the, only, supplier, of, a, particular, thing, this, contrasts, with, a, monopsony, which, relates, to, a, single, entity, s, control, of, a, market, to, purchase, a, good, or, service, and, with, oligopoly, and, duopoly, which, consists, of, a, few, sellers, dominating, a, market, monopolies, are, thus, characterised, by, a, lack, of, economic, competition, to, produce, the, good, or, service, a, lack, of, viable, substitute, goods, and, the, possibility, of, a, high, monopoly, price, well, above, the, seller, s, marginal, cost, that, leads, to, a, high, monopoly, profit, the, verb, monopolise, or, monopolize, refers, to, the, process, by, which, a, company, gains, the, ability, to, raise, prices, or, exclude, competitors, in, economics, a, monopoly, is, a, single, seller, in, law, a, monopoly, is, a, business, entity, that, has, significant, market, power, that, is, the, power, to, charge, overly, high, prices, which, is, associated, with, unfair, price, raises, although, monopolies, may, be, big, businesses, size, is, not, a, characteristic, of, a, monopoly, a, small, business, may, still, have, the, power, to, raise, prices, in, a, small, industry, or, market, a, monopoly, may, also, have, monopsony, control, of, a, sector, of, a, market, a, monopsony, is, a, market, situation, in, which, there, is, only, one, buyer, likewise, a, monopoly, should, be, distinguished, from, a, cartel, a, form, of, oligopoly, in, which, several, providers, act, together, to, coordinate, services, prices, or, sale, of, goods, monopolies, monopsonies, and, oligopolies, are, all, situations, in, which, one, or, a, few, entities, have, market, power, and, therefore, interact, with, their, customers, monopoly, or, oligopoly, or, suppliers, monopsony, in, ways, that, distort, the, market, monopolies, can, be, formed, by, mergers, and, integrations, form, naturally, or, be, established, by, a, government, in, many, jurisdictions, competition, laws, restrict, monopolies, due, to, government, concerns, over, potential, adverse, effects, holding, a, dominant, position, or, a, monopoly, in, a, market, is, often, not, illegal, in, itself, however, certain, categories, of, behavior, can, be, considered, abusive, and, therefore, incur, legal, sanctions, when, business, is, dominant, a, government, granted, monopoly, or, legal, monopoly, by, contrast, is, sanctioned, by, the, state, often, to, provide, an, incentive, to, invest, in, a, risky, venture, or, enrich, a, domestic, interest, group, patents, copyrights, and, trademarks, are, sometimes, used, as, examples, of, government, granted, monopolies, the, government, may, also, reserve, the, venture, for, itself, thus, forming, a, government, monopoly, for, example, with, a, state, owned, company, monopolies, may, be, naturally, occurring, due, to, limited, competition, because, the, industry, is, resource, intensive, and, requires, substantial, costs, to, operate, e, g, certain, railroad, systems, market, structure, is, determined, by, following, factors, in, economics, the, idea, of, monopolies, is, important, in, the, study, of, management, structures, which, directly, concerns, normative, aspects, of, economic, competition, and, provides, the, basis, for, topics, such, as, industrial, organization, and, economics, of, regulation, there, are, four, basic, types, of, market, structures, in, traditional, economic, analysis, perfect, competition, monopolistic, competition, oligopoly, and, monopoly, a, monopoly, is, a, structure, in, which, a, single, supplier, produces, and, sells, a, given, product, or, service, if, there, is, a, single, seller, in, a, certain, market, and, there, are, no, close, substitutes, for, the, product, then, the, market, structure, is, that, of, a, pure, monopoly, sometimes, there, are, many, sellers, in, an, industry, or, there, exist, many, close, substitutes, for, the, goods, being, produced, but, nevertheless, companies, retain, some, market, power, this, is, termed, monopolistic, competition, whereas, in, an, oligopoly, the, companies, interact, strategically, in, general, the, main, results, from, this, theory, compare, the, price, fixing, methods, across, market, structures, analyze, the, effect, of, a, certain, structure, on, welfare, and, vary, technological, or, demand, assumptions, in, order, to, assess, the, consequences, for, an, abstract, model, of, society, most, economic, textbooks, follow, the, practice, of, carefully, explaining, the, perfect, competition, model, mainly, because, this, helps, to, understand, departures, from, it, the, so, called, imperfect, competition, models, the, boundaries, of, what, constitutes, a, market, and, what, does, not, are, relevant, distinctions, to, make, in, economic, analysis, in, a, general, equilibrium, context, a, good, is, a, specific, concept, including, geographical, and, time, related, characteristics, most, studies, of, market, structure, relax, a, little, their, definition, of, a, good, allowing, for, more, flexibility, in, the, identification, of, substitute, goods, a, monopoly, has, at, least, one, of, these, five, characteristics, market, power, can, be, estimated, with, lerner, index, high, profit, margins, might, not, correspond, to, a, high, rate, of, return, or, monopoly, prices, and, might, represent, risk, premiums, monopolies, derive, their, market, power, from, barriers, to, entry, circumstances, that, prevent, or, greatly, impede, a, potential, competitor, s, ability, to, compete, in, a, market, there, are, three, major, types, of, barriers, to, entry, economic, legal, and, deliberate, in, addition, to, barriers, to, entry, and, competition, barriers, to, exit, may, be, a, source, of, market, power, barriers, to, exit, are, market, conditions, that, make, it, difficult, or, expensive, for, a, company, to, end, its, involvement, with, a, market, high, liquidation, costs, are, a, primary, barrier, to, exiting, market, exit, and, shutdown, are, sometimes, separate, events, the, decision, of, whether, to, shut, down, or, operate, is, not, affected, by, exit, barriers, a, company, will, shut, down, if, the, price, falls, below, minimum, average, variable, costs, while, monopoly, and, perfect, competition, represent, the, extremes, of, market, structures, there, is, some, similarity, the, cost, functions, are, the, same, both, monopolies, and, perfectly, competitive, pc, companies, minimize, cost, and, maximize, profit, the, shutdown, decisions, are, the, same, both, are, assumed, to, have, perfectly, competitive, factors, markets, there, are, distinctions, some, of, the, most, important, are, as, follows, the, most, significant, distinction, between, a, pc, company, and, a, monopoly, is, that, the, monopoly, has, a, downward, sloping, demand, curve, rather, than, the, perceived, perfectly, elastic, curve, of, the, pc, company, practically, all, the, variations, mentioned, above, relate, to, this, fact, if, there, is, a, downward, sloping, demand, curve, then, by, necessity, there, is, a, distinct, marginal, revenue, curve, the, implications, of, this, fact, are, best, made, manifest, with, a, linear, demand, curve, assume, that, the, inverse, demand, curve, is, of, the, form, x, a, b, y, displaystyle, x, a, by, then, the, total, revenue, curve, is, tr, a, y, b, y, 2, displaystyle, text, tr, ay, by, 2, and, the, marginal, revenue, curve, is, thus, mr, a, 2, b, y, displaystyle, text, mr, a, 2by, from, this, several, things, are, evident, first, the, marginal, revenue, curve, has, the, same, x, displaystyle, x, intercept, as, the, inverse, demand, curve, second, the, slope, of, the, marginal, revenue, curve, is, twice, that, of, the, inverse, demand, curve, what, is, not, quite, so, evident, is, that, the, marginal, revenue, curve, is, below, the, inverse, demand, curve, at, all, points, y, 0, displaystyle, y, geq, 0, since, all, companies, maximise, profits, by, equating, mr, displaystyle, text, mr, and, mc, displaystyle, text, mc, it, must, be, the, case, that, at, the, profit, maximizing, quantity, mr, and, mc, are, less, than, price, which, further, implies, that, a, monopoly, produces, less, quantity, at, a, higher, price, than, if, the, market, were, perfectly, competitive, the, fact, that, a, monopoly, has, a, downward, sloping, demand, curve, means, that, the, relationship, between, total, revenue, and, output, for, a, monopoly, is, much, different, from, that, of, competitive, companies, total, revenue, equals, price, times, quantity, a, competitive, company, has, a, perfectly, elastic, demand, curve, meaning, that, total, revenue, is, proportional, to, output, thus, the, total, revenue, curve, for, a, competitive, company, is, a, ray, with, a, slope, equal, to, the, market, price, a, competitive, company, can, sell, all, the, output, it, desires, at, the, market, price, for, a, monopoly, to, increase, sales, it, must, reduce, price, thus, the, total, revenue, curve, for, a, monopoly, is, a, parabola, that, begins, at, the, origin, and, reaches, a, maximum, value, then, continuously, decreases, until, total, revenue, is, again, zero, total, revenue, has, its, maximum, value, when, the, slope, of, the, total, revenue, function, is, zero, the, slope, of, the, total, revenue, function, is, marginal, revenue, so, the, revenue, maximizing, quantity, and, price, occur, when, mr, 0, displaystyle, text, mr, 0, for, example, assume, that, the, monopoly, s, demand, function, is, p, 50, 2, q, displaystyle, p, 50, 2q, the, total, revenue, function, would, be, tr, 50, q, 2, q, 2, displaystyle, text, tr, 50q, 2q, 2, and, marginal, revenue, would, be, 50, 4, q, displaystyle, 50, 4q, setting, marginal, revenue, equal, to, zero, we, have, so, the, revenue, maximizing, quantity, for, the, monopoly, is, 12, 5, units, and, the, revenue, maximizing, price, is, 25, a, company, with, a, monopoly, does, not, experience, price, pressure, from, competitors, although, it, may, experience, pricing, pressure, from, potential, competition, if, a, company, increases, prices, too, much, then, others, may, enter, the, market, if, they, are, able, to, provide, the, same, good, or, a, substitute, at, a, lesser, price, the, idea, that, monopolies, in, markets, with, easy, entry, need, not, be, regulated, against, is, known, as, the, revolution, in, monopoly, theory, a, monopolist, can, extract, only, one, premium, and, getting, into, complementary, markets, does, not, pay, that, is, the, total, profits, a, monopolist, could, earn, if, it, sought, to, leverage, its, monopoly, in, one, market, by, monopolizing, a, complementary, market, are, equal, to, the, extra, profits, it, could, earn, anyway, by, charging, more, for, the, monopoly, product, itself, however, the, one, monopoly, profit, theorem, is, not, true, if, customers, in, the, monopoly, good, are, stranded, or, poorly, informed, or, if, the, tied, good, has, high, fixed, costs, a, pure, monopoly, has, the, same, economic, rationality, of, perfectly, competitive, companies, i, e, to, optimise, a, profit, function, given, some, constraints, by, the, assumptions, of, increasing, marginal, costs, exogenous, inputs, prices, and, control, concentrated, on, a, single, agent, or, entrepreneur, the, optimal, decision, is, to, equate, the, marginal, cost, and, marginal, revenue, of, production, nonetheless, a, pure, monopoly, can, unlike, a, competitive, company, alter, the, market, price, for, its, own, convenience, a, decrease, of, production, results, in, a, higher, price, in, the, economics, jargon, it, is, said, that, pure, monopolies, have, a, downward, sloping, demand, an, important, consequence, of, such, behaviour, is, that, typically, a, monopoly, selects, a, higher, price, and, lesser, quantity, of, output, than, a, price, taking, company, again, less, is, available, at, a, higher, price, a, monopoly, chooses, that, price, that, maximizes, the, difference, between, total, revenue, and, total, cost, the, basic, markup, rule, as, measured, by, the, lerner, index, can, be, expressed, as, p, m, c, p, 1, e, d, displaystyle, frac, p, mc, p, frac, 1, e, d, where, e, d, displaystyle, e, d, is, the, price, elasticity, of, demand, the, firm, faces, the, markup, rules, indicate, that, the, ratio, between, profit, margin, and, the, price, is, inversely, proportional, to, the, price, elasticity, of, demand, the, implication, of, the, rule, is, that, the, more, elastic, the, demand, for, the, product, the, less, pricing, power, the, monopoly, has, market, power, is, the, ability, to, increase, the, product, s, price, above, marginal, cost, without, losing, all, customers, perfectly, competitive, pc, companies, have, zero, market, power, when, it, comes, to, setting, prices, all, companies, of, a, pc, market, are, price, takers, the, price, is, set, by, the, interaction, of, demand, and, supply, at, the, market, or, aggregate, level, individual, companies, simply, take, the, price, determined, by, the, market, and, produce, that, quantity, of, output, that, maximizes, the, company, s, profits, if, a, pc, company, attempted, to, increase, prices, above, the, market, level, all, its, customers, would, abandon, the, company, and, purchase, at, the, market, price, from, other, companies, a, monopoly, has, considerable, although, not, unlimited, market, power, a, monopoly, has, the, power, to, set, prices, or, quantities, although, not, both, a, monopoly, is, a, price, maker, the, monopoly, is, the, market, and, prices, are, set, by, the, monopolist, based, on, their, circumstances, and, not, the, interaction, of, demand, and, supply, the, two, primary, factors, determining, monopoly, market, power, are, the, company, s, demand, curve, and, its, cost, structure, market, power, is, the, ability, to, affect, the, terms, and, conditions, of, exchange, so, that, the, price, of, a, product, is, set, by, a, single, company, price, is, not, imposed, by, the, market, as, in, perfect, competition, although, a, monopoly, s, market, power, is, great, it, is, still, limited, by, the, demand, side, of, the, market, a, monopoly, has, a, negatively, sloped, demand, curve, not, a, perfectly, inelastic, curve, consequently, any, price, increase, will, result, in, the, loss, of, some, customers, price, discrimination, allows, a, monopolist, to, increase, its, profit, by, charging, higher, prices, for, identical, goods, to, those, who, are, willing, or, able, to, pay, more, for, example, most, economic, textbooks, cost, more, in, the, united, states, than, in, developing, countries, like, ethiopia, in, this, case, the, publisher, is, using, its, government, granted, copyright, monopoly, to, price, discriminate, between, the, generally, wealthier, american, economics, students, and, the, generally, poorer, ethiopian, economics, students, similarly, most, patented, medications, cost, more, in, the, u, s, than, in, other, countries, with, a, presumed, poorer, customer, base, typically, a, high, general, price, is, listed, and, various, market, segments, get, varying, discounts, this, is, an, example, of, framing, to, make, the, process, of, charging, some, people, higher, prices, more, socially, acceptable, perfect, price, discrimination, would, allow, the, monopolist, to, charge, each, customer, the, exact, maximum, amount, they, would, be, willing, to, pay, this, would, allow, the, monopolist, to, extract, all, the, consumer, surplus, of, the, market, a, domestic, example, would, be, the, cost, of, airplane, flights, in, relation, to, their, takeoff, time, the, closer, they, are, to, flight, the, higher, the, plane, tickets, will, cost, discriminating, against, late, planners, and, often, business, flyers, while, such, perfect, price, discrimination, is, a, theoretical, construct, advances, in, information, technology, and, micromarketing, may, bring, it, closer, to, the, realm, of, possibility, partial, price, discrimination, can, cause, some, customers, who, are, inappropriately, pooled, with, high, price, customers, to, be, excluded, from, the, market, for, example, a, poor, student, in, the, u, s, might, be, excluded, from, purchasing, an, economics, textbook, at, the, u, s, price, which, the, student, may, have, been, able, to, purchase, at, the, ethiopian, price, similarly, a, wealthy, student, in, ethiopia, may, be, able, to, or, willing, to, buy, at, the, u, s, price, though, naturally, would, hide, such, a, fact, from, the, monopolist, so, as, to, pay, the, reduced, third, world, price, these, are, deadweight, losses, and, decrease, a, monopolist, s, profits, deadweight, loss, is, considered, detrimental, to, society, and, market, participation, as, such, monopolists, have, substantial, economic, interest, in, improving, their, market, information, and, market, segmenting, there, is, important, information, for, one, to, remember, when, considering, the, monopoly, model, diagram, and, its, associated, conclusions, displayed, here, the, result, that, monopoly, prices, are, higher, and, production, output, lesser, than, a, competitive, company, follow, from, a, requirement, that, the, monopoly, not, charge, different, prices, for, different, customers, that, is, the, monopoly, is, restricted, from, engaging, in, price, discrimination, this, is, termed, first, degree, price, discrimination, such, that, all, customers, are, charged, the, same, amount, if, the, monopoly, were, permitted, to, charge, individualised, prices, this, is, termed, third, degree, price, discrimination, the, quantity, produced, and, the, price, charged, to, the, marginal, customer, would, be, identical, to, that, of, a, competitive, company, thus, eliminating, the, deadweight, loss, however, all, gains, from, trade, social, welfare, would, accrue, to, the, monopolist, and, none, to, the, consumer, in, essence, every, consumer, would, be, indifferent, between, going, completely, without, the, product, or, service, and, being, able, to, purchase, it, from, the, monopolist, as, long, as, the, price, elasticity, of, demand, for, most, customers, is, less, than, one, in, absolute, value, it, is, advantageous, for, a, company, to, increase, its, prices, it, receives, more, money, for, fewer, goods, with, a, price, increase, price, elasticity, tends, to, increase, and, in, the, optimum, case, above, it, will, be, greater, than, one, for, most, customers, a, company, maximizes, profit, by, selling, where, marginal, revenue, equals, marginal, cost, a, company, that, does, not, engage, in, price, discrimination, will, charge, the, profit, maximizing, price, p, displaystyle, p, to, all, its, customers, in, such, circumstances, there, are, customers, who, would, be, willing, to, pay, a, higher, price, than, p, displaystyle, p, and, those, who, will, not, pay, p, displaystyle, p, but, would, buy, at, a, lower, price, a, price, discrimination, strategy, is, to, charge, less, price, sensitive, buyers, a, higher, price, and, the, more, price, sensitive, buyers, a, lower, price, thus, additional, revenue, is, generated, from, two, sources, the, basic, problem, is, to, identify, customers, by, their, willingness, to, pay, the, purpose, of, price, discrimination, is, to, transfer, consumer, surplus, to, the, producer, consumer, surplus, is, the, difference, between, the, value, of, a, good, to, a, consumer, and, the, price, the, consumer, must, pay, in, the, market, to, purchase, it, price, discrimination, is, not, limited, to, monopolies, market, power, is, a, company, s, ability, to, increase, prices, without, losing, all, its, customers, any, company, that, has, market, power, can, engage, in, price, discrimination, perfect, competition, is, the, only, market, form, in, which, price, discrimination, would, be, impossible, a, perfectly, competitive, company, has, a, perfectly, elastic, demand, curve, and, has, no, market, power, there, are, three, forms, of, price, discrimination, first, degree, price, discrimination, charges, each, consumer, the, maximum, price, the, consumer, is, willing, to, pay, second, degree, price, discrimination, involves, quantity, discounts, third, degree, price, discrimination, involves, grouping, consumers, according, to, willingness, to, pay, as, measured, by, their, price, elasticities, of, demand, and, charging, each, group, a, different, price, third, degree, price, discrimination, is, the, most, prevalent, type, there, are, three, conditions, that, must, be, present, for, a, company, to, engage, in, successful, price, discrimination, first, the, company, must, have, market, power, second, the, company, must, be, able, to, sort, customers, according, to, their, willingness, to, pay, for, the, good, third, the, firm, must, be, able, to, prevent, resell, a, company, must, have, some, degree, of, market, power, to, practice, price, discrimination, without, market, power, a, company, cannot, charge, more, than, the, market, price, any, market, structure, characterized, by, a, downward, sloping, demand, curve, has, market, power, monopoly, monopolistic, competition, and, oligopoly, the, only, market, structure, that, has, no, market, power, is, perfect, competition, a, company, wishing, to, practice, price, discrimination, must, be, able, to, prevent, middlemen, or, brokers, from, acquiring, the, consumer, surplus, for, themselves, the, company, accomplishes, this, by, preventing, or, limiting, resale, many, methods, are, used, to, prevent, resale, for, instance, persons, are, required, to, show, photographic, identification, and, a, boarding, pass, before, boarding, an, airplane, most, travelers, assume, that, this, practice, is, strictly, a, matter, of, security, however, a, primary, purpose, in, requesting, photographic, identification, is, to, confirm, that, the, ticket, purchaser, is, the, person, about, to, board, the, airplane, and, not, someone, who, has, repurchased, the, ticket, from, a, discount, buyer, the, inability, to, prevent, resale, is, the, largest, obstacle, to, successful, price, discrimination, companies, have, however, developed, numerous, methods, to, prevent, resale, for, example, universities, require, that, students, show, identification, before, entering, sporting, events, governments, may, make, it, illegal, to, resell, tickets, or, products, in, boston, red, sox, baseball, tickets, can, only, be, resold, legally, to, the, team, the, three, basic, forms, of, price, discrimination, are, first, second, and, third, degree, price, discrimination, in, first, degree, price, discrimination, the, company, charges, the, maximum, price, each, customer, is, willing, to, pay, the, maximum, price, a, consumer, is, willing, to, pay, for, a, unit, of, the, good, is, the, reservation, price, thus, for, each, unit, the, seller, tries, to, set, the, price, equal, to, the, consumer, s, reservation, price, direct, information, about, a, consumer, s, willingness, to, pay, is, rarely, available, sellers, tend, to, rely, on, secondary, information, such, as, where, a, person, lives, postal, codes, for, example, catalog, retailers, can, use, mail, high, priced, catalogs, to, high, income, postal, codes, first, degree, price, discrimination, most, frequently, occurs, in, regard, to, professional, services, or, in, transactions, involving, direct, buyer, seller, negotiations, for, example, an, accountant, who, has, prepared, a, consumer, s, tax, return, has, information, that, can, be, used, to, charge, customers, based, on, an, estimate, of, their, ability, to, pay, in, second, degree, price, discrimination, or, quantity, discrimination, customers, are, charged, different, prices, based, on, how, much, they, buy, there, is, a, single, price, schedule, for, all, consumers, but, the, prices, vary, depending, on, the, quantity, of, the, good, bought, the, theory, of, second, degree, price, discrimination, is, a, consumer, is, willing, to, buy, only, a, certain, quantity, of, a, good, at, a, given, price, companies, know, that, consumer, s, willingness, to, buy, decreases, as, more, units, are, purchased, the, task, for, the, seller, is, to, identify, these, price, points, and, to, reduce, the, price, once, one, is, reached, in, the, hope, that, a, reduced, price, will, trigger, additional, purchases, from, the, consumer, for, example, sell, in, unit, blocks, rather, than, individual, units, in, third, degree, price, discrimination, or, multi, market, price, discrimination, the, seller, divides, the, consumers, into, different, groups, according, to, their, willingness, to, pay, as, measured, by, their, price, elasticity, of, demand, each, group, of, consumers, effectively, becomes, a, separate, market, with, its, own, demand, curve, and, marginal, revenue, curve, the, firm, then, attempts, to, maximize, profits, in, each, segment, by, equating, mr, and, mc, generally, the, company, charges, a, higher, price, to, the, group, with, a, more, price, inelastic, demand, and, a, relatively, lesser, price, to, the, group, with, a, more, elastic, demand, examples, of, third, degree, price, discrimination, abound, airlines, charge, higher, prices, to, business, travelers, than, to, vacation, travelers, the, reasoning, is, that, the, demand, curve, for, a, vacation, traveler, is, relatively, elastic, while, the, demand, curve, for, a, business, traveler, is, relatively, inelastic, any, determinant, of, price, elasticity, of, demand, can, be, used, to, segment, markets, for, example, seniors, have, a, more, elastic, demand, for, movies, than, do, young, adults, because, they, generally, have, more, free, time, thus, theaters, will, offer, discount, tickets, to, seniors, assume, that, by, a, uniform, pricing, system, the, monopolist, would, sell, five, units, at, a, price, of, 10, per, unit, assume, that, his, marginal, cost, is, 5, per, unit, total, revenue, would, be, 50, total, costs, would, be, 25, and, profits, would, be, 25, if, the, monopolist, practiced, price, discrimination, he, would, sell, the, first, unit, for, 17, the, second, unit, for, 14, and, so, on, which, is, listed, in, the, table, below, total, revenue, would, be, 55, his, total, cost, would, be, 25, and, his, profit, would, be, 30, several, things, are, worth, noting, the, monopolist, acquires, all, the, consumer, surplus, and, eliminates, practically, all, the, deadweight, loss, because, he, is, willing, to, sell, to, anyone, who, is, willing, to, pay, at, least, the, marginal, cost, thus, the, price, discrimination, promotes, efficiency, secondly, by, the, pricing, scheme, price, average, revenue, and, equals, marginal, revenue, that, is, the, monopolist, behaving, like, a, perfectly, competitive, company, thirdly, the, discriminating, monopolist, produces, a, larger, quantity, than, the, monopolist, operating, by, a, uniform, pricing, scheme, successful, price, discrimination, requires, that, companies, separate, consumers, according, to, their, willingness, to, buy, determining, a, customer, s, willingness, to, buy, a, good, is, difficult, asking, consumers, directly, is, fruitless, consumers, do, not, know, and, to, the, extent, they, do, they, are, reluctant, to, share, that, information, with, marketers, the, two, main, methods, for, determining, willingness, to, buy, are, observation, of, personal, characteristics, and, consumer, actions, as, noted, information, about, where, a, person, lives, postal, codes, how, the, person, dresses, what, kind, of, car, he, or, she, drives, occupation, and, income, and, spending, patterns, can, be, helpful, in, classifying, the, price, of, monopoly, is, upon, every, occasion, the, highest, which, can, be, got, the, natural, price, or, the, price, of, free, competition, on, the, contrary, is, the, lowest, which, can, be, taken, not, upon, every, occasion, indeed, but, for, any, considerable, time, together, the, one, is, upon, every, occasion, the, highest, which, can, be, squeezed, out, of, the, buyers, or, which, it, is, supposed, they, will, consent, to, give, the, other, is, the, lowest, which, the, sellers, can, commonly, afford, to, take, and, at, the, same, time, continue, their, business, 56, monopoly, besides, is, a, great, enemy, to, good, management, 127, adam, smith, 1776, the, wealth, of, nations, according, to, the, standard, model, in, which, a, monopolist, sets, a, single, price, for, all, consumers, the, monopolist, will, sell, a, lesser, quantity, of, goods, at, a, higher, price, than, would, companies, by, perfect, competition, because, the, monopolist, ultimately, forgoes, transactions, with, consumers, who, value, the, product, or, service, less, than, its, price, monopoly, pricing, creates, a, deadweight, loss, referring, to, potential, gains, that, went, neither, to, the, monopolist, nor, to, consumers, deadweight, loss, is, the, cost, to, society, because, it, is, inefficient, given, the, presence, of, this, deadweight, loss, the, combined, surplus, or, wealth, for, the, monopolist, and, consumers, is, necessarily, less, than, the, total, surplus, obtained, by, consumers, by, perfect, competition, where, efficiency, is, defined, by, the, total, gains, from, trade, the, monopoly, setting, is, less, efficient, than, perfect, competition, it, is, often, argued, that, monopolies, tend, to, become, less, efficient, and, less, innovative, over, time, becoming, complacent, because, they, do, not, have, to, be, efficient, or, innovative, to, compete, in, the, marketplace, sometimes, this, very, loss, of, psychological, efficiency, can, increase, a, potential, competitor, s, value, enough, to, overcome, market, entry, barriers, or, provide, incentive, for, research, and, investment, into, new, alternatives, the, theory, of, contestable, markets, argues, that, in, some, circumstances, private, monopolies, are, forced, to, behave, as, if, there, were, competition, because, of, the, risk, of, losing, their, monopoly, to, new, entrants, this, is, likely, to, happen, when, a, market, s, barriers, to, entry, are, low, it, might, also, be, because, of, the, availability, in, the, longer, term, of, substitutes, in, other, markets, for, example, a, canal, monopoly, while, worth, a, great, deal, during, the, late, 18th, century, united, kingdom, was, worth, much, less, during, the, late, 19th, century, because, of, the, introduction, of, railways, as, a, substitute, contrary, to, common, misconception, monopolists, do, not, try, to, sell, items, for, the, highest, possible, price, nor, do, they, try, to, maximize, profit, per, unit, but, rather, they, try, to, maximize, total, profit, a, natural, monopoly, is, an, organization, that, experiences, increasing, returns, to, scale, over, the, relevant, range, of, output, and, relatively, high, fixed, costs, a, natural, monopoly, occurs, where, the, average, cost, of, production, declines, throughout, the, relevant, range, of, product, demand, the, relevant, range, of, product, demand, is, where, the, average, cost, curve, is, below, the, demand, curve, when, this, situation, occurs, it, is, always, more, efficient, for, one, large, company, to, supply, the, market, than, multiple, smaller, companies, in, fact, absent, government, intervention, in, such, markets, will, naturally, evolve, into, a, monopoly, often, a, natural, monopoly, is, the, outcome, of, an, initial, rivalry, between, several, competitors, an, early, market, entrant, that, takes, advantage, of, the, cost, structure, and, can, expand, rapidly, can, exclude, smaller, companies, from, entering, and, can, drive, or, buy, out, other, companies, a, natural, monopoly, suffers, from, the, same, inefficiencies, as, any, other, monopoly, left, to, its, own, devices, a, profit, seeking, natural, monopoly, will, produce, where, marginal, revenue, equals, marginal, costs, regulation, of, natural, monopolies, is, problematic, fragmenting, such, monopolies, is, by, definition, inefficient, the, most, frequently, used, methods, dealing, with, natural, monopolies, are, government, regulations, and, public, ownership, government, regulation, generally, consists, of, regulatory, commissions, charged, with, the, principal, duty, of, setting, prices, natural, monopolies, are, synonymous, with, what, is, called, single, unit, enterprise, a, term, which, was, used, in, the, 1914, book, social, economics, written, by, friedrich, von, wieser, as, mentioned, government, regulations, are, frequently, used, with, natural, monopolies, to, help, control, prices, an, example, that, can, illustrate, this, can, be, found, when, looking, at, the, united, states, postal, service, which, has, a, monopoly, over, types, of, mail, according, to, wieser, the, idea, of, a, competitive, market, within, the, postal, industry, would, lead, to, extreme, prices, and, unnecessary, spending, and, this, highlighted, why, government, regulation, in, the, form, of, price, control, is, necessary, as, it, helped, efficient, market, to, reduce, prices, and, increase, output, regulators, often, use, average, cost, pricing, by, average, cost, pricing, the, price, and, quantity, are, determined, by, the, intersection, of, the, average, cost, curve, and, the, demand, curve, this, pricing, scheme, eliminates, any, positive, economic, profits, since, price, equals, average, cost, average, cost, pricing, is, not, perfect, regulators, must, estimate, average, costs, companies, have, a, reduced, incentive, to, lower, costs, regulation, of, this, type, has, not, been, limited, to, natural, monopolies, average, cost, pricing, does, also, have, some, disadvantages, by, setting, price, equal, to, the, intersection, of, the, demand, curve, and, the, average, total, cost, curve, the, firm, s, output, is, allocatively, inefficient, as, the, price, is, less, than, the, marginal, cost, which, is, the, output, quantity, for, a, perfectly, competitive, and, allocatively, efficient, market, in, 1848, j, s, mill, was, the, first, individual, to, describe, monopolies, with, the, adjective, natural, he, used, it, interchangeably, with, practical, at, the, time, mill, gave, the, following, examples, of, natural, or, practical, monopolies, gas, supply, water, supply, roads, canals, and, railways, in, his, social, economics, friedrich, von, wieser, demonstrated, his, view, of, the, postal, service, as, a, natural, monopoly, in, the, face, of, single, unit, administration, the, principle, of, competition, becomes, utterly, abortive, the, parallel, network, of, another, postal, organization, beside, the, one, already, functioning, would, be, economically, absurd, enormous, amounts, of, money, for, plant, and, management, would, have, to, be, expended, for, no, purpose, whatever, overall, most, monopolies, are, man, made, monopolies, or, unnatural, monopolies, not, natural, ones, a, government, granted, monopoly, also, called, a, de, jure, monopoly, is, a, form, of, coercive, monopoly, in, which, a, government, grants, exclusive, privilege, to, a, private, individual, or, company, to, be, the, sole, provider, of, a, commodity, monopoly, may, be, granted, explicitly, as, when, potential, competitors, are, excluded, from, the, market, by, a, specific, law, or, implicitly, such, as, when, the, requirements, of, an, administrative, regulation, can, only, be, fulfilled, by, a, single, market, player, or, through, some, other, legal, or, procedural, mechanism, such, as, patents, trademarks, and, copyright, these, monopolies, can, also, be, the, result, of, rent, seeking, behavior, where, firms, will, try, to, get, the, prize, of, having, a, monopoly, and, the, increase, of, profits, in, acquiring, one, from, a, competitive, market, in, their, sector, a, monopolist, should, shut, down, when, price, is, less, than, average, variable, cost, for, every, output, level, in, other, words, where, the, demand, curve, is, entirely, below, the, average, variable, cost, curve, under, these, circumstances, at, the, profit, maximum, level, of, output, mr, mc, average, revenue, would, be, less, than, average, variable, costs, and, the, monopolists, would, be, better, off, shutting, down, in, the, short, term, in, an, unregulated, market, monopolies, can, potentially, be, ended, by, new, competition, breakaway, businesses, or, consumers, seeking, alternatives, in, a, regulated, market, a, government, will, often, either, regulate, the, monopoly, convert, it, into, a, publicly, owned, monopoly, environment, or, forcibly, fragment, it, see, antitrust, law, and, trust, busting, public, utilities, often, being, naturally, efficient, with, only, one, operator, and, therefore, less, susceptible, to, efficient, breakup, are, often, strongly, regulated, or, publicly, owned, american, telephone, telegraph, at, t, and, standard, oil, are, often, cited, as, examples, of, the, breakup, of, a, private, monopoly, by, government, the, bell, system, later, at, t, was, protected, from, competition, first, by, the, kingsbury, commitment, and, later, by, a, series, of, agreements, between, at, t, and, the, federal, government, in, 1984, decades, after, having, been, granted, monopoly, power, by, force, of, law, at, t, was, broken, up, into, various, components, mci, sprint, who, were, able, to, compete, effectively, in, the, long, distance, phone, market, these, breakups, are, due, to, the, presence, of, deadweight, loss, and, inefficiency, in, a, monopolistic, market, causing, the, government, to, intervene, on, behalf, of, consumers, and, society, in, order, to, incite, competition, while, the, sentiment, among, regulators, and, judges, has, generally, been, against, breakups, as, remedies, for, antitrust, enforcement, recent, scholarship, has, found, that, this, hostility, to, breakups, by, administrators, is, largely, unwarranted, 1, in, fact, some, scholars, have, argued, that, breakups, even, if, incorrectly, targeted, could, still, encourage, collaboration, innovation, and, efficiency, 49, the, law, regulating, dominance, in, the, european, union, is, governed, by, article, 102, of, the, treaty, on, the, functioning, of, the, european, union, which, aims, at, enhancing, the, consumer, s, welfare, and, also, the, efficiency, of, allocation, of, resources, by, protecting, competition, on, the, downstream, market, the, existence, of, a, very, high, market, share, does, not, always, mean, consumers, are, paying, excessive, prices, since, the, threat, of, new, entrants, to, the, market, can, restrain, a, high, market, share, company, s, price, increases, competition, law, does, not, make, merely, having, a, monopoly, illegal, but, rather, abusing, the, power, a, monopoly, may, confer, for, instance, through, exclusionary, practices, i, e, pricing, high, just, because, it, is, the, only, one, around, it, should, also, be, noted, that, it, is, illegal, to, try, to, obtain, a, monopoly, through, practices, like, buying, out, the, competition, or, similar, methods, if, a, monopoly, occurs, naturally, such, as, a, competitor, going, out, of, business, or, a, lack, of, competition, it, is, not, illegal, until, the, monopoly, holder, abuses, their, power, first, it, is, necessary, to, determine, whether, a, company, is, dominant, or, whether, it, behaves, to, an, appreciable, extent, independently, of, its, competitors, customers, and, ultimately, its, consumers, establishing, dominance, is, a, two, stage, test, the, first, thing, to, consider, is, market, definition, which, is, one, of, the, crucial, factors, of, the, test, this, includes, the, relevant, product, market, and, the, relevant, geographic, market, as, the, definition, of, the, market, is, of, a, matter, of, interchangeability, if, the, goods, or, services, are, regarded, as, interchangeable, then, they, are, within, the, same, product, market, for, example, in, the, case, of, united, brands, v, commission, it, was, argued, in, this, case, that, bananas, and, other, fresh, fruit, were, in, the, same, product, market, and, later, on, dominance, was, found, because, the, special, features, of, the, banana, made, it, could, only, be, interchangeable, with, other, fresh, fruits, in, a, limited, extent, and, other, and, is, only, exposed, to, their, competition, in, a, way, that, is, hardly, perceptible, the, demand, substitutability, of, the, goods, and, services, will, help, in, defining, the, product, market, and, it, can, be, access, by, the, hypothetical, monopolist, test, or, the, ssnip, test, it, is, necessary, to, define, it, because, some, goods, can, only, be, supplied, within, a, narrow, area, due, to, technical, practical, or, legal, reasons, and, this, may, help, to, indicate, which, undertakings, impose, a, competitive, constraint, on, the, other, undertakings, in, question, since, some, goods, are, too, expensive, to, transport, where, it, might, not, be, economic, to, sell, them, to, distant, markets, in, relation, to, their, value, therefore, the, cost, of, transporting, is, a, crucial, factor, here, other, factors, might, be, legal, controls, which, restricts, an, undertaking, in, a, member, states, from, exporting, goods, or, services, to, another, market, definition, may, be, difficult, to, measure, but, is, important, because, if, it, is, defined, too, narrowly, the, undertaking, may, be, more, likely, to, be, found, dominant, and, if, it, is, defined, too, broadly, the, less, likely, that, it, will, be, found, dominant, as, with, collusive, conduct, market, shares, are, determined, with, reference, to, the, particular, market, in, which, the, company, and, product, in, question, is, sold, it, does, not, in, itself, determine, whether, an, undertaking, is, dominant, but, work, as, an, indicator, of, the, states, of, the, existing, competition, within, the, market, the, herfindahl, hirschman, index, hhi, is, sometimes, used, to, assess, how, competitive, an, industry, is, it, sums, up, the, squares, of, the, individual, market, shares, of, all, of, the, competitors, within, the, market, the, lower, the, total, the, less, concentrated, the, market, and, the, higher, the, total, the, more, concentrated, the, market, in, the, us, the, merger, guidelines, state, that, a, post, merger, hhi, below, 1000, is, viewed, as, not, concentrated, while, hhis, above, that, will, provoke, further, review, by, european, union, law, very, large, market, shares, raise, a, presumption, that, a, company, is, dominant, which, may, be, rebuttable, a, market, share, of, 100, may, be, very, rare, but, it, is, still, possible, to, be, found, and, in, fact, it, has, been, identified, in, some, cases, for, instance, the, aams, v, commission, case, undertakings, possessing, market, share, that, is, lower, than, 100, but, over, 90, had, also, been, found, dominant, for, example, microsoft, v, commission, case, in, the, akzo, v, commission, case, the, undertaking, is, presumed, to, be, dominant, if, it, has, a, market, share, of, 50, there, are, also, findings, of, dominance, that, are, below, a, market, share, of, 50, for, instance, united, brands, v, commission, it, only, possessed, a, market, share, of, 40, to, 45, and, still, to, be, found, dominant, with, other, factors, the, lowest, yet, market, share, of, a, company, considered, dominant, in, the, eu, was, 39, 7, if, a, company, has, a, dominant, position, then, there, is, a, special, responsibility, not, to, allow, its, conduct, to, impair, competition, on, the, common, market, however, these, will, all, falls, away, if, it, is, not, dominant, when, considering, whether, an, undertaking, is, dominant, it, involves, a, combination, of, factors, each, of, them, cannot, be, taken, separately, as, if, they, are, they, will, not, be, as, determinative, as, they, are, when, they, are, combined, also, in, cases, where, an, undertaking, has, previously, been, found, dominant, it, is, still, necessary, to, redefine, the, market, and, make, a, whole, new, analysis, of, the, conditions, of, competition, based, on, the, available, evidence, at, the, appropriate, time, according, to, the, guidance, there, are, three, more, issues, that, must, be, examined, they, are, actual, competitors, that, relates, to, the, market, position, of, the, dominant, undertaking, and, its, competitors, potential, competitors, that, concerns, the, expansion, and, entry, and, lastly, the, countervailing, buyer, power, market, share, may, be, a, valuable, source, of, information, regarding, the, market, structure, and, the, market, position, when, it, comes, to, accessing, it, the, dynamics, of, the, market, and, the, extent, to, which, the, goods, and, services, differentiated, are, relevant, in, this, area, it, concerns, with, the, competition, that, would, come, from, other, undertakings, which, are, not, yet, operating, in, the, market, but, will, enter, it, in, the, future, so, market, shares, may, not, be, useful, in, accessing, the, competitive, pressure, that, is, exerted, on, an, undertaking, in, this, area, the, potential, entry, by, new, firms, and, expansions, by, an, undertaking, must, be, taken, into, account, therefore, the, barriers, to, entry, and, barriers, to, expansion, is, an, important, factor, here, competitive, constraints, may, not, always, come, from, actual, or, potential, competitors, sometimes, it, may, also, come, from, powerful, customers, who, have, sufficient, bargaining, strength, which, come, from, its, size, or, its, commercial, significance, for, a, dominant, firm, there, are, three, main, types, of, abuses, which, are, exploitative, abuse, exclusionary, abuse, and, single, market, abuse, it, arises, when, a, monopolist, has, such, significant, market, power, that, it, can, restrict, its, output, while, increasing, the, price, above, the, competitive, level, without, losing, customers, this, type, is, less, concerned, by, the, commission, than, other, types, this, is, most, concerned, about, by, the, commissions, because, it, is, capable, of, causing, long, term, consumer, damage, and, is, more, likely, to, prevent, the, development, of, competition, an, example, of, it, is, exclusive, dealing, agreements, it, arises, when, a, dominant, undertaking, carrying, out, excess, pricing, which, would, not, only, have, an, exploitative, effect, but, also, prevent, parallel, imports, and, limits, intra, brand, competition, despite, wide, agreement, that, the, above, constitute, abusive, practices, there, is, some, debate, about, whether, there, needs, to, be, a, causal, connection, between, the, dominant, position, of, a, company, and, its, actual, abusive, conduct, furthermore, there, has, been, some, consideration, of, what, happens, when, a, company, merely, attempts, to, abuse, its, dominant, position, to, provide, a, more, specific, example, economic, and, philosophical, scholar, adam, smith, cites, that, trade, to, the, east, india, company, has, for, the, most, part, been, subjected, to, an, exclusive, company, such, as, that, of, the, english, or, dutch, monopolies, such, as, these, are, generally, established, against, the, nation, in, which, they, arose, out, of, the, profound, economist, goes, on, to, state, how, there, are, two, types, of, monopolies, the, first, type, of, monopoly, is, one, which, tends, to, always, attract, to, the, particular, trade, where, the, monopoly, was, conceived, a, greater, proportion, of, the, stock, of, the, society, than, what, would, go, to, that, trade, originally, the, second, type, of, monopoly, tends, to, occasionally, attract, stock, towards, the, particular, trade, where, it, was, conceived, and, sometimes, repel, it, from, that, trade, depending, on, varying, circumstances, rich, countries, tended, to, repel, while, poorer, countries, were, attracted, to, this, for, example, the, dutch, company, would, dispose, of, any, excess, goods, not, taken, to, the, market, in, order, to, preserve, their, monopoly, while, the, english, sold, more, goods, for, better, prices, both, of, these, tendencies, were, extremely, destructive, as, can, be, seen, in, adam, smith, s, writings, the, term, monopoly, first, appears, in, aristotle, s, politics, aristotle, describes, thales, of, miletus, s, cornering, of, the, market, in, olive, presses, as, a, monopoly, another, early, reference, to, the, concept, of, monopoly, in, a, commercial, sense, appears, in, tractate, demai, of, the, mishna, 2nd, century, ce, regarding, the, purchasing, of, agricultural, goods, from, a, dealer, who, has, a, monopoly, on, the, produce, chapter, 5, 4, the, meaning, and, understanding, of, the, english, word, monopoly, has, changed, over, the, years, vending, of, common, salt, sodium, chloride, was, historically, a, natural, monopoly, until, recently, a, combination, of, strong, sunshine, and, low, humidity, or, an, extension, of, peat, marshes, was, necessary, for, producing, salt, from, the, sea, the, most, plentiful, source, changing, sea, levels, periodically, caused, salt, famines, and, communities, were, forced, to, depend, upon, those, who, controlled, the, scarce, inland, mines, and, salt, springs, which, were, often, in, hostile, areas, e, g, the, sahara, requiring, well, organised, security, for, transport, storage, and, distribution, the, salt, commission, was, a, legal, monopoly, in, china, formed, in, 758, the, commission, controlled, salt, production, and, sales, in, order, to, raise, tax, revenue, for, the, tang, dynasty, the, gabelle, was, a, notoriously, high, tax, levied, upon, salt, in, the, kingdom, of, france, the, much, hated, levy, had, a, role, in, the, beginning, of, the, french, revolution, when, strict, legal, controls, specified, who, was, allowed, to, sell, and, distribute, salt, first, instituted, in, 1286, the, gabelle, was, not, permanently, abolished, until, 1945, robin, gollan, argues, in, the, coalminers, of, new, south, wales, that, anti, competitive, practices, developed, in, the, coal, industry, of, australia, s, newcastle, as, a, result, of, the, business, cycle, the, monopoly, was, generated, by, formal, meetings, of, the, local, management, of, coal, companies, agreeing, to, fix, a, minimum, price, for, sale, at, dock, this, collusion, was, known, as, the, vend, the, vend, ended, and, was, reformed, repeatedly, during, the, late, 19th, century, ending, by, recession, in, the, business, cycle, the, vend, was, able, to, maintain, its, monopoly, due, to, trade, union, assistance, and, material, advantages, primarily, coal, geography, during, the, early, 20th, century, as, a, result, of, comparable, monopolistic, practices, in, the, australian, coastal, shipping, business, the, vend, developed, as, an, informal, and, illegal, collusion, between, the, steamship, owners, and, the, coal, industry, eventually, resulting, in, the, high, court, case, adelaide, steamship, co, ltd, v, r, ag, in, the, 17th, century, shah, abbas, established, new, julfa, a, suburb, in, the, capital, of, isfahan, to, concentrate, armenian, financial, capital, in, iran, accordingly, he, gave, armenians, various, privileges, including, the, monopoly, to, trade, persian, filoselle, raw, silk, armenians, exported, it, all, over, the, world, including, asia, europe, and, america, by, the, 1750s, armenia, already, controlled, 75, of, the, total, silk, trade, in, the, area, this, resulted, in, a, boom, in, armenian, commerce, which, lasted, for, the, next, 150, years, at, present, as, it, happens, armenia, s, own, economy, is, itself, highly, monopolized, in, fact, with, 19, of, its, economy, monopolized, armenia, was, the, most, monopolized, country, in, eastern, europe, and, central, asia, in, 2009, standard, oil, was, an, american, oil, producing, transporting, refining, and, marketing, company, established, in, 1870, it, became, the, largest, oil, refiner, in, the, world, john, d, rockefeller, was, a, founder, chairman, and, major, shareholder, the, company, was, an, innovator, in, the, development, of, the, business, trust, the,

competitors, and, form, a, monopoly, that, threatened, consumers, its, controversial, history, as, one, of, the, world, s, first, and, largest, multinational, corporations, ended, in, 1911, when, the, united, states, supreme, court, ruled, that, standard, was, an, illegal, monopoly, the, standard, oil, trust, was, dissolved, into, 33, smaller, companies, two, of, its, surviving, child, companies,
