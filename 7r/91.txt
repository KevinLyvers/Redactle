bankruptcy, is, a, legal, process, through, which, people, or, other, entities, who, cannot, repay, debts, to, creditors, may, seek, relief, from, some, or, all, of, their, debts, in, most, jurisdictions, bankruptcy, is, imposed, by, a, court, order, often, initiated, by, the, debtor, bankrupt, is, not, the, only, legal, status, that, an, insolvent, person, may, have, and, the, term, bankruptcy, is, therefore, not, a, synonym, for, insolvency, the, word, bankruptcy, is, derived, from, italian, banca, rotta, literally, meaning, broken, bank, the, term, is, often, described, as, having, originated, in, renaissance, italy, where, there, allegedly, existed, the, tradition, of, smashing, a, banker, s, bench, if, he, defaulted, on, payment, however, the, existence, of, such, a, ritual, is, doubted, in, ancient, greece, bankruptcy, did, not, exist, if, a, man, owed, and, he, could, not, pay, he, and, his, wife, children, or, servants, were, forced, into, debt, slavery, until, the, creditor, recouped, losses, through, their, physical, labour, many, city, states, in, ancient, greece, limited, debt, slavery, to, a, period, of, five, years, debt, slaves, had, protection, of, life, and, limb, which, regular, slaves, did, not, have, however, servants, of, the, debtor, could, be, retained, beyond, that, deadline, by, the, creditor, and, were, often, forced, to, serve, their, new, lord, for, a, lifetime, usually, under, significantly, harsher, conditions, an, exception, to, this, rule, was, athens, which, by, the, laws, of, solon, forbade, enslavement, for, debt, as, a,

became, bankrupt, three, times, a, failure, of, a, nation, to, meet, bond, repayments, has, been, seen, on, many, occasions, in, a, similar, way, philip, ii, of, spain, had, to, declare, four, state, bankruptcies, in, 1557, 1560, 1575, and, 1596, according, to, kenneth, s, rogoff, although, the, development, of, international, capital, markets, was, quite, limited, prior, to, 1800, we, nevertheless, catalog, the, various, defaults, of, france, portugal, prussia, spain, and, the, early, italian, city, states, at, the, edge, of, europe, egypt, russia, and, turkey, have, histories, of, chronic, default, as, well, the, principal, focus, of, modern, insolvency, legislation, and, business, debt, restructuring, practices, no, longer, rests, on, the, elimination, of, insolvent, entities, but, on, the, remodeling, of, the, financial, and, organizational, structure, of, debtors, experiencing, financial, distress, so, as, to, permit, the, rehabilitation, and, continuation, of, the, business, for, private, households, it, is, important, to, assess, the, underlying, problems, and, to, minimize, the, risk, of, financial, distress, to, recur, it, has, been, stressed, that, debt, advice, a, supervised, rehabilitation, period, financial, education, and, social, help, to, find, sources, of, income, and, to, improve, the, management, of, household, expenditures, must, be, equally, provided, during, this, period, of, rehabilitation, refiner, et, al, 2003, gerhardt, 2009, frade, 2010, in, most, eu, member, states, debt, discharge, is, conditioned, by, a, partial, payment, obligation, and, by, a, number, of, requirements, concerning, the, debtor, s, behavior, in, the, united, states, us, discharge, is, conditioned, to, a, lesser, extent, the, spectrum, is, broad, in, the, eu, with, the, uk, coming, closest, to, the, us, system, reifner, et, al, 2003, gerhardt, 2009, frade, 2010, the, other, member, states, do, not, provide, the, option, of, a, debt, discharge, spain, for, example, passed, a, bankruptcy, law, ley, concurs, in, 2003, which, provides, for, debt, settlement, plans, that, can, result, in, a, reduction, of, the, debt, maximally, half, of, the, amount, or, an, extension, of, the, payment, period, of, maximally, five, years, gerhardt, 2009, but, it, does, not, foresee, debt, discharge, in, the, us, it, is, very, difficult, to, discharge, federal, or, federally, guaranteed, student, loan, debt, by, filing, bankruptcy, unlike, most, other, debts, those, student, loans, may, be, discharged, only, if, the, person, seeking, discharge, establishes, specific, grounds, for, discharge, under, the, brunner, test, under, which, the, court, evaluates, three, factors, even, if, a, debtor, proves, all, three, elements, a, court, may, permit, only, a, partial, discharge, of, the, student, loan, student, loan, borrowers, may, benefit, from, restructuring, their, payments, through, a, chapter, 13, bankruptcy, repayment, plan, but, few, qualify, for, discharge, of, part, or, all, of, their, student, loan, debt, bankruptcy, fraud, is, a, white, collar, crime, most, typically, involving, concealment, of, assets, by, a, debtor, to, avoid, liquidation, in, bankruptcy, proceedings, it, may, include, filing, of, false, information, multiple, filings, in, different, jurisdictions, bribery, and, other, acts, while, difficult, to, generalize, across, jurisdictions, common, criminal, acts, under, bankruptcy, statutes, typically, involve, concealment, of, assets, concealment, or, destruction, of, documents, conflicts, of, interest, fraudulent, claims, false, statements, or, declarations, and, fee, fixing, or, redistribution, arrangements, falsifications, on, bankruptcy, forms, often, constitute, perjury, multiple, filings, are, not, in, and, of, themselves, criminal, but, they, may, violate, provisions, of, bankruptcy, law, in, the, u, s, bankruptcy, fraud, statutes, are, particularly, focused, on, the, mental, state, of, particular, actions, bankruptcy, fraud, is, a, federal, crime, in, the, united, states, bankruptcy, fraud, should, be, distinguished, from, strategic, bankruptcy, which, is, not, a, criminal, act, since, it, creates, a, real, not, a, fake, bankruptcy, state, however, it, may, still, work, against, the, filer, all, assets, must, be, disclosed, in, bankruptcy, schedules, whether, or, not, the, debtor, believes, the, asset, has, a, net, value, this, is, because, once, a, bankruptcy, petition, is, filed, it, is, for, the, creditors, not, the, debtor, to, decide, whether, a, particular, asset, has, value, the, future, ramifications, of, omitting, assets, from, schedules, can, be, quite, serious, for, the, offending, debtor, in, the, united, states, a, closed, bankruptcy, may, be, reopened, by, motion, of, a, creditor, or, the, u, s, trustee, if, a, debtor, attempts, to, later, assert, ownership, of, such, an, unscheduled, asset, after, being, discharged, of, all, debt, in, the, bankruptcy, the, trustee, may, then, seize, the, asset, and, liquidate, it, for, the, benefit, of, the, formerly, discharged, creditors, whether, or, not, a, concealment, of, such, an, asset, should, also, be, considered, for, prosecution, as, fraud, or, perjury, would, then, be, at, the, discretion, of, the, judge, or, u, s, trustee, in, some, countries, such, as, the,

expected, that, the, uk, government, s, liberalisation, of, the, uk, bankruptcy, regime, would, increase, the, number, of, bankruptcy, cases, initially, cases, increased, as, the, insolvency, service, statistics, appear, to, bear, out, since, 2009, the, introduction, of, the, debt, relief, order, has, resulted, in, a, dramatic, fall, in, bankruptcies, the, latest, estimates, for, year, 2014, 15, being, significantly, less, than, 30, 000, cases, the, uk, bankruptcy, law, was, changed, in, may, 2000, effective, may, 29, 2000, debtors, may, now, retain, occupational, pensions, while, in,

bankruptcy, in, the, united, states, is, a, matter, placed, under, federal, jurisdiction, by, the, united, states, constitution, in, article, 1, section, 8, clause, 4, which, empowers, congress, to, enact, uniform, laws, on, the, subject, of, bankruptcies, throughout, the, united, states, congress, has, enacted, statutes, governing, bankruptcy, primarily, in, the, form, of, the, bankruptcy, code, located, at, title, 11, of, the, united, states, code, a, debtor, declares, bankruptcy, to, obtain, relief, from, debt, and, this, is, normally, accomplished, either, through, a, discharge, of, the, debt, or, through, a, restructuring, of, the, debt, when, a, debtor, files, a, voluntary, petition, their, bankruptcy, case, commences, while, bankruptcy, cases, are, always, filed, in, united, states, bankruptcy, court, an, adjunct, to, the, u, s, district, courts, bankruptcy, cases, particularly, with, respect, to, the, validity, of, claims, and, exemptions, are, often, dependent, upon, state, law, a, bankruptcy, exemption, defines, the, property, a, debtor, may, retain, and, preserve, through, bankruptcy, certain, real, and, personal, property, can, be, exempted, on, schedule, c, of, a, debtor, s, bankruptcy, forms, and, effectively, be, taken, outside, the, debtor, s, bankruptcy, estate, bankruptcy, exemptions, are, available, only, to, individuals, filing, bankruptcy, there, are, two, alternative, systems, that, can, be, used, to, exempt, property, from, a, bankruptcy, estate, federal, exemptions, available, in, some, states, but, not, all, and, state, exemptions, which, vary, widely, between, states, for, example, maryland, and, virginia, which, are, adjoining, states, have, different, personal, exemption, amounts, that, cannot, be, seized, for, payment, of, debts, this, amount, is, the, first, 6, 000, in, property, or, cash, in, maryland, but, normally, only, the, first, 5, 000, in, virginia, state, law, therefore, plays, a, major, role, in, many, bankruptcy, cases, such, that, there, may, be, significant, differences, in, the, outcome, of, a, bankruptcy, case, depending, upon, the, state, in, which, it, is, filed, after, a, bankruptcy, petition, is, filed, the, court, schedules, a, hearing, called, a, 341, meeting, or, meeting, of, creditors, at, which, the, bankruptcy, trustee, and, creditors, review, the, petitioner, s, petition, and, supporting, schedules, question, the, petitioner, and, can, challenge, exemptions, they, believe, are, improper, there, are, six, types, of, bankruptcy, under, the, bankruptcy, code, located, at, title, 11, of, the, united, states, code, an, important, feature, applicable, to, all, types, of, bankruptcy, filings, is, the, automatic, stay, the, automatic, stay, means, that, the, mere, request, for, bankruptcy, protection, automatically, halts, most, lawsuits, repossessions, foreclosures, evictions, garnishments, attachments, utility, shut, offs, and, debt, collection, activity, the, most, common, types, of, personal, bankruptcy, for, individuals, are, chapter, 7, and, chapter, 13, chapter, 7, known, as, a, straight, bankruptcy, involves, the, discharge, of, certain, debts, without, repayment, chapter, 13, involves, a, plan, of, repayment, of, debts, over, a, period, of, years, whether, a, person, qualifies, for, chapter, 7, or, chapter, 13, is, in, part, determined, by, income, as, many, as, 65, of, all, us, consumer, bankruptcy, filings, are, chapter, 7, cases, before, a, consumer, may, obtain, bankruptcy, relief, under, either, chapter, 7, or, chapter, 13, the, debtor, is, to, undertake, credit, counseling, with, approved, counseling, agencies, prior, to, filing, a, bankruptcy, petition, and, to, undertake, education, in, personal, financial, management, from, approved, agencies, prior, to, being, granted, a, discharge, of, debts, under, either, chapter, 7, or, chapter, 13, some, studies, of, the, operation, of, the, credit, counseling, requirement, suggest, that, it, provides, little, benefit, to, debtors, who, receive, the, counseling, because, the, only, realistic, option, for, many, is, to, seek, relief, under, the, bankruptcy, code, corporations, and, other, business, forms, normally, file, under, chapters, 7, or, 11, often, called, straight, bankruptcy, or, simple, bankruptcy, a, chapter, 7, bankruptcy, potentially, allows, debtors, to, eliminate, most, or, all, of, their, debts, over, a, period, of, as, little, as, three, or, four, months, in, a, typical, consumer, bankruptcy, the, only, debts, that, survive, a, chapter, 7, are, student, loans, child, support, obligations, some, tax, bills, and, criminal, fines, credit, cards, pay, day, loans, personal, loans, medical, bills, and, just, about, all, other, bills, are, discharged, in, chapter, 7, a, debtor, surrenders, non, exempt, property, to, a, bankruptcy, trustee, who, then, liquidates, the, property, and, distributes, the, proceeds, to, the, debtor, s, unsecured, creditors, in, exchange, the, debtor, is, entitled, to, a, discharge, of, some, debt, however, the, debtor, is, not, granted, a, discharge, if, guilty, of, certain, types, of, inappropriate, behavior, e, g, concealing, records, relating, to, financial, condition, and, certain, debts, e, g, spousal, and, child, support, and, most, student, loans, some, taxes, are, not, discharged, even, though, the, debtor, is, generally, discharged, from, debt, many, individuals, in, financial, distress, own, only, exempt, property, e, g, clothes, household, goods, an, older, car, or, the, tools, of, their, trade, or, profession, and, do, not, have, to, surrender, any, property, to, the, trustee, the, amount, of, property, that, a, debtor, may, exempt, varies, from, state, to, state, as, noted, above, virginia, and, maryland, have, a, 1, 000, difference, chapter, 7, relief, is, available, only, once, in, any, eight, year, period, generally, the, rights, of, secured, creditors, to, their, collateral, continues, even, though, their, debt, is, discharged, for, example, absent, some, arrangement, by, a, debtor, to, surrender, a, car, or, reaffirm, a, debt, the, creditor, with, a, security, interest, in, the, debtor, s, car, may, repossess, the, car, even, if, the, debt, to, the, creditor, is, discharged, ninety, one, percent, of, us, individuals, who, petition, for, relief, under, chapter, 7, hire, an, attorney, to, file, their, petitions, the, typical, cost, of, an, attorney, is, 1, 170, 00, alternatives, to, filing, with, an, attorney, are, filing, pro, se, hiring, a, non, lawyer, petition, preparer, or, using, online, software, to, generate, the, petition, to, be, eligible, to, file, a, consumer, bankruptcy, under, chapter, 7, a, debtor, must, qualify, under, a, statutory, means, test, the, means, test, was, intended, to, make, it, more, difficult, for, a, significant, number, of, financially, distressed, individual, debtors, whose, debts, are, primarily, consumer, debts, to, qualify, for, relief, under, chapter, 7, of, the, bankruptcy, code, the, means, test, is, employed, in, cases, where, an, individual, with, primarily, consumer, debts, has, more, than, the, average, annual, income, for, a, household, of, equivalent, size, computed, over, a, 180, day, period, prior, to, filing, if, the, individual, must, take, the, means, test, their, average, monthly, income, over, this, 180, day, period, is, reduced, by, a, series, of, allowances, for, living, expenses, and, secured, debt, payments, in, a, very, complex, calculation, that, may, or, may, not, accurately, reflect, that, individual, s, actual, monthly, budget, if, the, results, of, the, means, test, show, no, disposable, income, or, in, some, cases, a, very, small, amount, then, the, individual, qualifies, for, chapter, 7, relief, an, individual, who, fails, the, means, test, will, have, their, chapter, 7, case, dismissed, or, may, have, to, convert, the, case, to, a, chapter, 13, bankruptcy, if, a, debtor, does, not, qualify, for, relief, under, chapter, 7, of, the, bankruptcy, code, either, because, of, the, means, test, or, because, chapter, 7, does, not, provide, a, permanent, solution, to, delinquent, payments, for, secured, debts, such, as, mortgages, or, vehicle, loans, the, debtor, may, still, seek, relief, under, chapter, 13, of, the, code, generally, a, trustee, sells, most, of, the, debtor, s, assets, to, pay, off, creditors, however, certain, debtor, assets, will, be, protected, to, some, extent, by, bankruptcy, exemptions, these, include, social, security, payments, unemployment, compensation, limited, equity, in, a, home, car, or, truck, household, goods, and, appliances, trade, tools, and, books, however, these, exemptions, vary, from, state, to, state, in, chapter, 11, bankruptcy, the, debtor, retains, ownership, and, control, of, assets, and, is, re, termed, a, debtor, in, possession, dip, the, debtor, in, possession, runs, the, day, to, day, operations, of, the, business, while, creditors, and, the, debtor, work, with, the, bankruptcy, court, in, order, to, negotiate, and, complete, a, plan, upon, meeting, certain, requirements, e, g, fairness, among, creditors, priority, of, certain, creditors, creditors, are, permitted, to, vote, on, the, proposed, plan, if, a, plan, is, confirmed, the, debtor, continues, to, operate, and, pay, debts, under, the, terms, of, the, confirmed, plan, if, a, specified, majority, of, creditors, do, not, vote, to, confirm, a, plan, additional, requirements, may, be, imposed, by, the, court, in, order, to, confirm, the, plan, debtors, filing, for, chapter, 11, protection, a, second, time, are, known, informally, as, chapter, 22, filers, in, a, corporate, or, business, bankruptcy, an, indebted, company, is, typically, recapitalized, so, that, it, emerges, from, bankruptcy, with, more, equity, and, less, debt, with, potential, for, dispute, over, the, valuation, of, the, reorganized, business, in, chapter, 13, debtors, retain, ownership, and, possession, of, all, their, assets, but, must, devote, some, portion, of, future, income, to, repaying, creditors, generally, over, three, to, five, years, the, amount, of, payment, and, period, of, the, repayment, plan, depend, upon, a, variety, of, factors, including, the, value, of, the, debtor, s, property, and, the, amount, of, a, debtor, s, income, and, expenses, under, this, chapter, the, debtor, can, propose, a, repayment, plan, in, which, to, pay, creditors, over, three, to, five, years, if, the, monthly, income, is, less, than, the, state, s, median, income, the, plan, is, for, three, years, unless, the, court, finds, just, cause, to, extend, the, plan, for, a, longer, period, if, the, debtor, s, monthly, income, is, greater, than, the, median, income, for, individuals, in, the, debtor, s, state, the, plan, must, generally, be, for, five, years, a, plan, cannot, exceed, the, five, year, limit, relief, under, chapter, 13, is, available, only, to, individuals, with, regular, income, whose, debts, do, not, exceed, prescribed, limits, if, the, debtor, is, an, individual, or, a, sole, proprietor, the, debtor, is, allowed, to, file, for, a, chapter, 13, bankruptcy, to, repay, all, or, part, of, the, debts, secured, creditors, may, be, entitled, to, greater, payment, than, unsecured, creditors, in, contrast, to, chapter, 7, the, debtor, in, chapter, 13, may, keep, all, property, whether, or, not, exempt, if, the, plan, appears, feasible, and, if, the, debtor, complies, with, all, the, other, requirements, the, bankruptcy, court, typically, confirms, the, plan, and, the, debtor, and, creditors, are, bound, by, its, terms, creditors, have, no, say, in, the, formulation, of, the, plan, other, than, to, object, to, it, if, appropriate, on, the, grounds, that, it, does, not, comply, with, one, of, the, code, s, statutory, requirements, generally, the, debtor, makes, payments, to, a, trustee, who, disburses, the, funds, in, accordance, with, the, terms, of, the, confirmed, plan, when, the, debtor, completes, payments, pursuant, to, the, terms, of, the, plan, the, court, formally, grant, the, debtor, a, discharge, of, the, debts, provided, for, in, the, plan, however, if, the, debtor, fails, to, make, the, agreed, upon, payments, or, fails, to, seek, or, gain, court, approval, of, a, modified, plan, a, bankruptcy, court, will, normally, dismiss, the, case, on, the, motion, of, the, trustee, after, a, dismissal, creditors, may, resume, pursuit, of, state, law, remedies, to, recover, the, unpaid, debt, in, 2004, the, number, of, insolvencies, reached, record, highs, in, many, european, countries, in, france, company, insolvencies, rose, by, more, than, 4, in, austria, by, more, than, 10, and, in, greece, by, more, than, 20, the, increase, in, the, number, of, insolvencies, however, does, not, indicate, the, total, financial, impact, of, insolvencies, in, each, country, because, there, is, no, indication, of, the, size, of, each, case, an, increase, in, the, number, of, bankruptcy, cases, does, not, necessarily, entail, an, increase, in, bad, debt, write, off, rates, for, the, economy, as, a, whole, bankruptcy, statistics, are, also, a, trailing, indicator, there, is, a, time, delay, between, financial, difficulties, and, bankruptcy, in, most, cases, several, months, or, even, years, pass, between, the, financial, problems, and, the, start, of, bankruptcy, proceedings, legal, tax, and, cultural, issues, may, further, distort, bankruptcy, figures, especially, when, comparing, on, an, international, basis, two, examples, the, insolvency, numbers, for, private, individuals, also, do, not, show, the, whole, picture, only, a, fraction, of, heavily, indebted, households, file, for, insolvency, two, of, the, main, reasons, for, this, are, the, stigma, of, declaring, themselves, insolvent, and, the, potential, business, disadvantage, following, the, soar, in, insolvencies, in, the, last, decade, a, number, of, european, countries, such, as, france, germany, spain, and, italy, began, to, revamp, their, bankruptcy, laws, in, 2013, they, modelled, these, new, laws, on, chapter, 11, of, the, u, s, bankruptcy, code, currently, the, majority, of, insolvency, cases, have, ended, in, liquidation, in, europe, rather, than, the, businesses, surviving, the, crisis, these, new, law, models, are, meant, to, change, this, lawmakers, are, hoping, to, turn, bankruptcy, into, a, chance, for, restructuring, rather, than, a, death, sentence, for, the, companies, eu, policy, aims, to, ensure, that, honest, entrepreneurs, are, afforded, a, second, chance, at, business, development, a, faster, start, up, programme, for, people, affected, by, bankruptcy, operating, in, denmark, and, a, scheme, to, support, belgian, business, owners, and, self, employed, persons, were, highlighted, in, a, 2008, european, commission, communication, as, good, practice, examples, in, this, field, technically, states, do, not, collapse, directly, due, to, a, sovereign, default, event, itself, however, the, tumultuous, events, that, follow, may, bring, down, the, state, so, in, common, language, states, would, be, described, as, being, bankrupted, an, example, of, this, is, when, a, korean, state, bankrupted, imperial, china, causing, its, destruction, or, more, specifically, when, chang, an, s, sui, dynasty, war, with, pyongyang, goguryeo, in, 614, a, d, ended, in, the, former, s, disintegration, within, 4, years, although, the, latter, also, seemingly, entered, into, decline, and, fell, some, 56, years, later
