m, ori, m, ori, are, the, indigenous, polynesian, people, of, mainland, new, zealand, aotearoa, m, ori, originated, with, settlers, from, east, polynesia, who, arrived, in, new, zealand, in, several, waves, of, canoe, voyages, between, roughly, 1320, and, 1350, over, several, centuries, in, isolation, these, settlers, developed, their, own, distinctive, culture, whose, language, mythology, crafts, and, performing, arts, evolved, independently, from, those, of, other, eastern, polynesian, cultures, some, early, m, ori, moved, to, the, chatham, islands, where, their, descendants, became, new, zealand, s, other, indigenous, polynesian, ethnic, group, the, moriori, early, contact, between, m, ori, and, europeans, starting, in, the, 18th, century, ranged, from, beneficial, trade, to, lethal, violence, m, ori, actively, adopted, many, technologies, from, the, newcomers, with, the, signing, of, the, treaty, of, waitangi, in, 1840, the, two, cultures, coexisted, for, a, generation, rising, tensions, over, disputed, land, sales, led, to, conflict, in, the, 1860s, and, subsequent, land, confiscations, which, m, ori, resisted, fiercely, after, the, treaty, was, declared, a, legal, nullity, in, 1877, m, ori, were, forced, to, assimilate, into, many, aspects, of, western, culture, social, upheaval, and, epidemics, of, introduced, disease, took, a, devastating, toll, on, the, m, ori, population, which, fell, dramatically, but, began, to, recover, by, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, the, march, 2023, new, zealand, census, gives, the, number, of, people, of, m, ori, descent, as, 978, 246, 19, 6, of, the, total, population, an, increase, of, 12, 5, since, 2018, efforts, have, been, made, centring, on, the, treaty, of, waitangi, to, increase, the, standing, of, m, ori, in, wider, new, zealand, society, and, achieve, social, justice, traditional, m, ori, culture, has, enjoyed, a, significant, revival, which, was, further, bolstered, by, a, m, ori, protest, movement, that, emerged, in, the, 1960s, however, disproportionate, numbers, of, m, ori, face, significant, economic, and, social, obstacles, and, generally, have, lower, life, expectancies, and, incomes, than, other, new, zealand, ethnic, groups, they, suffer, higher, levels, of, crime, health, problems, imprisonment, and, educational, under, achievement, a, number, of, socio, economic, initiatives, have, been, instigated, with, the, aim, of, closing, the, gaps, between, m, ori, and, other, new, zealanders, political, and, economic, redress, for, historical, grievances, is, also, ongoing, see, treaty, of, waitangi, claims, and, settlements, m, ori, are, the, second, largest, ethnic, group, in, new, zealand, after, european, new, zealanders, commonly, known, by, the, m, ori, name, p, keh, in, addition, more, than, 170, 000, m, ori, live, in, australia, the, m, ori, language, is, spoken, to, some, extent, by, about, a, fifth, of, all, m, ori, representing, three, per, cent, of, the, total, population, m, ori, are, active, in, all, spheres, of, new, zealand, culture, and, society, with, independent, representation, in, areas, such, as, media, politics, and, sport, in, the, m, ori, language, the, word, m, ori, means, normal, natural, or, ordinary, in, legends, and, oral, traditions, the, word, distinguished, ordinary, mortal, human, beings, t, ngata, m, ori, from, deities, and,

qoli, which, has, the, reconstructed, meaning, true, real, genuine, early, visitors, from, europe, to, new, zealand, generally, referred, to, the, indigenous, inhabitants, as, new, zealanders, or, as, natives, the, m, ori, used, the, term, m, ori, to, describe, themselves, in, a, pan, tribal, sense, m, ori, people, often, use, the, term, tangata, whenua, literal, meaning, people, of, the, land, to, identify, in, a, way, that, expresses, their, relationship, with, a, particular, area, of, land, a, tribe, may, be, the, tangata, whenua, in, one, area, but, not, in, another, the, term, can, also, refer, to, the, m, ori, people, as, a, whole, in, relation, to, new, zealand, aotearoa, as, a, whole, the, official, definition, of, m, ori, for, electoral, purposes, has, changed, over, time, before, 1974, the, government, required, documented, ancestry, to, determine, the, status, of, a, m, ori, person, and, only, those, with, at, least, 50, m, ori, ancestry, were, allowed, to, choose, which, seats, they, wished, to, vote, in, the, m, ori, affairs, amendment, act, 1974, changed, this, allowing, individuals, to, self, identify, as, to, their, cultural, identity, until, 1986, the, census, required, at, least, 50, per, cent, m, ori, ancestry, to, claim, m, ori, affiliation, currently, in, most, contexts, authorities, require, some, documentation, of, ancestry, or, continuing, cultural, connection, such, as, acceptance, by, others, as, being, of, the, people, however, there, is, no, minimum, ancestry, requirement, no, credible, evidence, exists, of, pre, m, ori, settlement, of, new, zealand, on, the, other, hand, compelling, evidence, from, archaeology, linguistics, and, physical, anthropology, indicates, that, the, first, settlers, migrated, from, polynesia, and, became, the, m, ori, evidence, indicates, that, their, ancestry, as, part, of, the, larger, group, of, austronesian, peoples, stretches, back, 5, 000, years, to, the, indigenous, peoples, of, taiwan, polynesian, people, settled, a, large, area, encompassing, tonga, samoa, tahiti, hawai, i, easter, island, rapa, nui, and, finally, new, zealand, the, date, of, first, arrival, and, settlement, is, a, matter, of, debate, there, may, have, been, some, exploration, and, settlement, before, the, eruption, of, mount, tarawera, c, 1315, based, on, finds, of, bones, from, polynesian, rats, and, rat, gnawed, shells, and, evidence, of, widespread, forest, fires, in, the, decade, or, so, prior, one, 2022, study, using, advanced, radiocarbon, technology, suggests, that, early, m, ori, settlement, happened, in, the, north, island, between, ad, 1250, and, ad, 1275, however, a, synthesis, of, archaeological, and, genetic, evidence, concludes, that, whether, or, not, some, settlers, arrived, before, the, tarawera, eruption, the, main, settlement, period, was, in, the, decades, after, it, somewhere, between, 1320, and, 1350, this, broadly, aligns, with, analyses, from, m, ori, oral, traditions, which, describe, the, arrival, of, ancestors, in, a, number, of, large, ocean, going, canoes, waka, as, a, planned, mass, migration, c, 1350, they, had, a, profound, impact, on, their, environment, from, their, first, settlement, in, new, zealand, and, voyages, further, south, with, definitive, archeological, evidence, of, brief, settlement, as, far, south, as, enderby, island, some, have, speculated, that, m, ori, explorers, may, have, been, the, first, humans, to, discover, antarctica, according, to, a, nineteenth, century, translation, by, stephenson, percy, smith, part, of, the, rarotongan, oral, history, describes, ui, te, rangiora, around, the, year, 650, leading, a, fleet, of, waka, t, wai, south, until, they, reached, a, place, of, bitter, cold, where, rock, like, structures, rose, from, a, solid, sea, based, on, interpretations, by, wehi, and, her, colleagues, subsequent, commentators, speculated, that, these, brief, descriptions, might, match, the, ross, ice, shelf, or, possibly, the, antarctic, mainland, or, icebergs, surrounded, by, sea, ice, found, in, the, southern, ocean, other, scholars, are, far, more, sceptical, raising, serious, problems, with, smith, s, translations, and, noting, the, seafaring, technologies, required, for, antarctic, voyaging, regardless, of, these, debates, the, m, ori, were, sophisticated, seafarers, and, new, zealand, has, a, strong, association, with, antarctica, and, a, wish, by, some, for, m, ori, values, to, be, integral, to, human, presence, there, the, earliest, period, of, m, ori, settlement, known, as, the, archaic, moahunter, or, colonisation, period, dates, from, the, time, of, arrival, to, c, 1500, the, early, m, ori, diet, included, an, abundance, of, moa, and, other, large, birds, and, fur, seals, that, had, never, been, hunted, before, this, archaic, period, is, known, for, its, distinctive, reel, necklaces, and, also, remarkable, for, the, lack, of, weapons, and, fortifications, typical, of, the, later, classic, m, ori, the, best, known, and, most, extensively, studied, archaic, site, at, wairau, bar, in, the, south, island, shows, evidence, of, occupation, from, early, 13th, century, to, the, early, 15th, century, it, is, the, only, known, new, zealand, archaeological, site, containing, the, bones, of, people, who, were, born, elsewhere, factors, that, operated, in, the, transition, to, the, classic, period, the, culture, at, the, time, of, european, contact, include, a, significantly, cooler, period, from, 1500, and, the, extinction, of, the, moa, and, of, other, food, species, the, classic, period, is, characterised, by, finely, made, pounamu, greenstone, weapons, and, ornaments, elaborately, carved, war, canoes, and, wharenui, meeting, houses, m, ori, lived, in, autonomous, settlements, in, extended, hap, groups, descended, from, common, iwi, ancestors, the, settlements, had, farmed, areas, and, food, sources, for, hunting, fishing, and, gathering, fortified, p, were, built, at, strategic, locations, due, to, occasional, warfare, over, wrongdoings, or, resources, this, practice, varied, over, different, locations, throughout, new, zealand, with, more, populations, in, the, far, north, there, is, a, stereotype, that, m, ori, were, natural, warriors, however, warfare, and, associated, practices, like, cannibalism, were, not, a, dominating, part, of, m, ori, culture, around, the, year, 1500, a, group, of, m, ori, migrated, east, to, the, chatham, islands, and, developed, into, a, people, known, as, the, moriori, with, pacifism, a, key, part, of, their, culture, the, first, european, explorers, of, new, zealand, were, abel, tasman, who, arrived, in, 1642, captain, james, cook, in, 1769, and, marion, du, fresne, in, 1772, initial, contact, between, m, ori, and, europeans, proved, problematic, and, sometimes, fatal, with, tasman, having, four, of, his, men, killed, and, probably, killing, at, least, one, m, ori, without, ever, landing, cook, s, men, shot, at, least, eight, m, ori, within, three, days, of, his, first, landing, although, he, later, had, good, relations, with, m, ori, three, years, later, after, a, promising, start, du, fresne, and, 26, men, of, his, crew, were, killed, from, the, 1780s, m, ori, also, increasingly, encountered, european, and, american, sealers, whalers, and, christian, missionaries, relations, were, mostly, peaceful, although, marred, by, several, further, violent, incidents, the, worst, of, which, was, the, boyd, massacre, in, 1807, and, subsequent, revenge, attacks, european, settlement, in, new, zealand, began, in, the, early, 19th, century, leading, to, an, extensive, sharing, of, culture, and, ideas, many, m, ori, valued, europeans, whom, they, called, p, keh, as, a, means, to, acquire, western, knowledge, and, technology, m, ori, quickly, adopted, writing, as, a, means, of, sharing, ideas, and, many, of, their, oral, stories, and, poems, were, converted, to, the, written, form, the, introduction, of, the, potato, revolutionised, agriculture, and, the, acquisition, of, muskets, by, m, ori, iwi, led, to, a, period, of, particularly, bloody, intertribal, warfare, known, as, the, musket, wars, in, which, many, groups, were, decimated, and, others, driven, from, their, traditional, territory, the, pacifist, moriori, in, the, chatham, islands, similarly, suffered, massacre, and, subjugation, in, an, invasion, by, some, taranaki, iwi, at, the, same, time, the, m, ori, suffered, high, mortality, rates, from, eurasian, infectious, diseases, such, as, influenza, smallpox, and, measles, which, killed, an, estimated, 10, to, 50, per, cent, of, m, ori, by, 1839, estimates, placed, the, number, of, europeans, living, in, new, zealand, as, high, as, 2, 000, and, the, british, crown, acceded, to, repeated, requests, from, missionaries, and, some, m, ori, chiefs, rangatira, to, intervene, the, british, government, sent, royal, navy, captain, william, hobson, to, negotiate, a, treaty, between, the, british, crown, and, the, m, ori, which, became, known, as, the, treaty, of, waitangi, starting, from, february, 1840, this, treaty, was, signed, by, the, crown, and, 500, m, ori, chiefs, from, across, new, zealand, the, treaty, gave, m, ori, the, rights, of, british, subjects, and, guaranteed, m, ori, property, rights, and, tribal, autonomy, in, return, for, accepting, british, sovereignty, and, the, annexation, of, new, zealand, as, a, colony, in, the, british, empire, however, disputes, continue, over, aspects, of, the, treaty, of, waitangi, including, wording, differences, in, the, two, versions, in, english, and, m, ori, as, well, as, misunderstandings, of, different, cultural, concepts, notably, the, m, ori, version, did, not, cede, sovereignty, to, the, british, crown, in, an, 1877, court, case, the, treaty, was, declared, a, simple, nullity, on, the, grounds, that, the, signatories, had, been, primitive, barbarians, nevertheless, relations, between, m, ori, and, p, keh, during, the, early, colonial, period, were, largely, peaceful, many, m, ori, groups, set, up, substantial, businesses, supplying, food, and, other, products, for, domestic, and, overseas, markets, when, violence, did, break, out, as, in, the, wairau, affray, flagstaff, war, hutt, valley, campaign, and, wanganui, campaign, it, was, generally, limited, and, concluded, with, a, peace, treaty, however, by, the, 1860s, rising, settler, numbers, and, tensions, over, disputed, land, purchases, led, to, the, later, new, zealand, wars, fought, by, the, colonial, government, against, numerous, m, ori, iwi, using, local, and, british, imperial, troops, and, some, allied, iwi, these, conflicts, resulted, in, the, colonial, government, confiscating, tracts, of, m, ori, land, as, punishment, for, what, were, called, rebellions, p, keh, settlers, would, occupy, the, confiscated, land, several, minor, conflicts, arose, after, the, wars, including, the, incident, at, parihaka, in, 1881, and, the, dog, tax, war, from, 1897, to, 1898, the, native, land, court, was, established, to, transfer, m, ori, land, from, communal, ownership, into, individual, title, as, a, means, to, assimilation, and, to, facilitate, greater, sales, to, european, settlers, by, the, late, 19th, century, a, widespread, belief, existed, amongst, both, p, keh, and, m, ori, that, the, m, ori, population, would, cease, to, exist, as, a, separate, race, or, culture, and, become, assimilated, into, the, european, population, from, the, late, 19th, to, the, mid, 20th, century, various, laws, policies, and, practices, were, instituted, in, new, zealand, society, with, the, effect, of, inducing, m, ori, to, conform, to, p, keh, norms, notable, among, these, are, the, tohunga, suppression, act, 1907, and, the, suppression, of, the, m, ori, language, by, schools, often, enforced, with, corporal, punishment, in, the, 1896, census, new, zealand, had, a, m, ori, population, of, 42, 113, by, which, time, europeans, numbered, more, than, 700, 000, the, decline, did, not, continue, and, the, m, ori, population, continued, to, recover, in, the, 20th, century, influential, m, ori, politicians, such, as, james, carroll, pirana, ngata, te, rangi, h, roa, and, m, ui, p, mare, aimed, to, revitalise, the, m, ori, people, after, the, devastation, of, the, previous, century, they, believed, the, future, path, called, for, a, degree, of, assimilation, with, m, ori, adopting, european, practices, such, as, western, medicine, while, also, retaining, traditional, cultural, practices, m, ori, also, fought, during, both, world, wars, in, specialised, battalions, the, m, ori, pioneer, battalion, in, wwi, and, the, 28th, m, ori, battalion, in, wwii, m, ori, were, also, badly, hit, by, the, 1918, influenza, epidemic, with, death, rates, for, m, ori, being, 4, 5, times, higher, than, for, p, keh, after, world, war, ii, te, reo, m, ori, use, declined, steeply, in, favour, of, english, since, the, 1960s, m, oridom, has, undergone, a, cultural, revival, concurrent, with, activism, for, social, justice, and, a, protest, movement, k, hanga, reo, m, ori, language, pre, schools, were, established, in, 1982, to, promote, m, ori, language, use, and, halt, the, decline, in, its, use, two, m, ori, language, television, channels, broadcast, content, in, the, m, ori, language, while, words, such, as, kia, ora, have, entered, widespread, use, in, new, zealand, english, government, recognition, of, the, growing, political, power, of, m, ori, and, political, activism, have, led, to, limited, redress, for, historic, land, confiscations, in, 1975, the, crown, set, up, the, waitangi, tribunal, to, investigate, historical, grievances, and, since, the, 1990s, the, new, zealand, government, has, negotiated, and, finalised, treaty, settlements, with, many, iwi, across, new, zealand, by, june, 2008, the, government, had, provided, over, nz, 900, million, in, settlements, much, of, it, in, the, form, of, land, deals, there, is, a, growing, m, ori, leadership, who, are, using, these, settlements, as, an, investment, platform, for, economic, development, despite, a, growing, acceptance, of, m, ori, culture, in, wider, new, zealand, society, treaty, settlements, have, generated, significant, controversy, some, m, ori, have, argued, that, the, settlements, occur, at, a, level, of, between, one, and, two, and, a, half, cents, on, the, dollar, of, the, value, of, the, confiscated, lands, and, do, not, represent, adequate, redress, conversely, some, non, m, ori, denounce, the, settlements, and, socioeconomic, initiatives, as, amounting, to, race, based, preferential, treatment, both, of, these, sentiments, were, expressed, during, the, new, zealand, foreshore, and, seabed, controversy, in, 2004, the, m, ori, king, movement, called, the, k, ngitanga, in, m, ori, is, a, m, ori, movement, that, arose, among, some, of, the, m, ori, iwi, tribes, of, new, zealand, in, the, central, north, island, in, the, 1850s, to, establish, a, role, similar, in, status, to, that, of, the, monarch, of, the, british, colonists, as, a, way, of, halting, the, alienation, of, m, ori, land, the, m, ori, monarch, operates, in, a, non, constitutional, capacity, with, no, legal, or, judicial, power, within, the, new, zealand, government, reigning, monarchs, retain, the, position, of, paramount, chief, of, several, iwi, and, wield, some, power, over, these, especially, within, tainui, the, current, m, ori, monarch, ng, wai, hono, i, te, p, was, elected, in, 2024, her, official, residence, is, t, rongo, house, at, t, rangawaewae, marae, in, the, town, of, ng, ruaw, hia, she, is, the, eighth, monarch, since, the, position, was, created, and, is, the, continuation, of, a, dynasty, that, reaches, back, to, the, inaugural, king, p, tatau, te, wherowhero, the, movement, arose, among, a, group, of, central, north, island, iwi, in, the, 1850s, as, a, means, of, attaining, m, ori, unity, to, halt, the, alienation, of, land, at, a, time, of, rapid, population, growth, by, european, colonists, the, movement, sought, to, establish, a, monarch, who, could, claim, status, similar, to, that, of, queen, victoria, and, thus, allow, m, ori, to, deal, with, p, keh, europeans, on, equal, footing, it, took, on, the, appearance, of, an, alternative, government, with, its, own, flag, newspaper, bank, councillors, magistrates, and, law, enforcement, but, it, was, viewed, by, the, colonial, government, as, a, challenge, to, the, supremacy, of, the, british, monarchy, leading, in, turn, to, the, 1863, invasion, of, waikato, which, was, partly, motivated, by, a, drive, to, neutralise, the, k, ngitanga, s, power, and, influence, following, their, defeat, at, r, kau, in, 1864, k, ngitanga, forces, withdrew, into, the, ng, ti, maniapoto, tribal, region, of, the, north, island, that, became, known, as, the, king, country, the, m, ori, monarch, s, influence, has, not, been, as, strong, as, it, could, be, partially, due, to, the, lack, of, affiliation, to, the, k, ngitanga, of, key, iwi, most, notably, tuhoe, ng, ti, porou, and, the, largest, iwi, of, all, ng, puhi, under, the, m, ori, affairs, amendment, act, 1974, a, m, ori, is, defined, as, a, person, of, the, m, ori, race, of, new, zealand, and, includes, any, descendant, of, such, a, person, the, m, ori, population, around, the, late, 18th, century, was, estimated, by, james, cook, at, 100, 000, historian, michael, king, suggests, a, slightly, higher, figure, of, 110, 000, is, more, likely, their, numbers, declined, during, the, 19th, century, to, as, low, as, 42, 000, the, decline, has, been, attributed, to, the, impact, of, european, colonisation, including, new, diseases, thereafter, the, population, grew, rapidly, there, were, 887, 493, people, identifying, as, being, part, of, the, m, ori, ethnic, group, at, the, 2023, new, zealand, census, making, up, 17,

increase, between, the, 2013, and, 2018, census, was, mainly, due, to, statistics, new, zealand, starting, to, add, ethnicity, data, from, other, sources, previous, censuses, administrative, data, and, imputation, to, the, census, data, to, reduce, the, number, of, non, responses, the, median, age, of, m, ori, was, 26, 8, years, compared, with, 38, 1, years, for, new, zealand, as, a, whole,

increasingly, strained, tensions, led, to, widespread, conflict, in, the, 1860s, and, the, confiscation, of, millions, of, acres, of, m, ori, land, significant, amounts, of, land, were, also,

economically, and, geographically, for, much, of, the, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, the, key, reason, for, this, was, that, m, ori, remained, almost, exclusively, a, rural, population, whereas, increasingly, the, european, population, was, urban, especially, after, 1900, nevertheless, m, ori, groups, continued, to, engage, with, the, government, and, in, legal, processes, to, increase, their, standing, in, and, ultimately, further, their, incorporation, into, wider, new, zealand, society, the, main, point, of, contact, with, the, government, were, the, four, m, ori, members, of,

keh, in, areas, such, as, health, income, skilled, employment, and, access, to, higher, levels, of, education, m, ori, leaders, and, government, policymakers, alike, struggled, to, deal, with, social, issues, stemming, from, increased, urban, migration, including, a, shortage, of, housing, and, jobs, and, a, rise, in, urban, crime, poverty, and, health, problems, in, regards, to, housing, a, 1961,
