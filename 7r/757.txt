amnesia, is, a, deficit, in, memory, caused, by, brain, damage, or, brain, diseases, but, it, can, also, be, temporarily, caused, by, the, use, of, various, sedative, and, hypnotic, drugs, the, memory, can, be, either, wholly, or, partially, lost, due, to, the, extent, of, damage, that, is, caused, there, are, two, main, types, of, amnesia, these, two, types, are, not, mutually, exclusive, both, can, also, occur, simultaneously, case, studies, also, show, that, amnesia, is, typically, associated, with, damage, to, the, medial, temporal, lobe, in, addition, specific, areas, of, the, hippocampus, the, ca1, region, are, involved, with, memory, research, has, also, shown, that, when, areas, of, the, diencephalon, are, damaged, amnesia, can, occur, recent, studies, have, shown, a, correlation, between, deficiency, of, rbap48, protein, and, memory, loss, scientists, were, able, to, find, that, mice, with, damaged, memory, have, a, lower, level, of, rbap48, protein, compared, to, normal, healthy, mice, in, people, with, amnesia, the, ability, to, recall, immediate, information, is, still, retained, and, they, may, still, be, able, to, form, new, memories, however, a, severe, reduction, in, the, ability, to, learn, new, material, and, retrieve, old, information, can, be, observed, people, can, learn, new, procedural, knowledge, in, addition, priming, both, perceptual, and, conceptual, can, assist, amnesiacs, in, the, learning, of, fresh, non, declarative, knowledge, individuals, with, amnesia, also, retain, substantial, intellectual, linguistic, and, social, skills, despite, profound, impairments, in, the, ability, to, recall, specific, information, encountered, in, prior, learning, episodes, the, term, is, from, ancient, greek, forgetfulness, from, a, without, and, mnesis, memory, individuals, with, amnesia, can, learn, new, information, particularly, if, the, information, is, non, declarative, knowledge, however, in, some, situations, people, with, dense, anterograde, amnesia, do, not, remember, the, episodes, during, which, they, previously, learned, or, observed, the, information, some, people, with, amnesia, show, abnormal, amount, of, memory, loss, confusion, and, difficulty, recalling, other, people, or, places, people, who, recover, often, do, not, remember, having, amnesia, declarative, memory, can, be, broken, down, into, semantic, memory, and, episodic, memory, semantic, memory, being, that, of, facts, episodic, memory, being, that, of, memory, related, to, events, while, a, patient, with, amnesia, might, have, a, loss, of, declarative, memory, this, loss, might, vary, in, severity, as, well, as, the, declarative, information, that, it, affects, depending, on, many, factors, for, example, lsj, was, a, patient, who, had, retrograde, declarative, memory, loss, as, the, result, of, bilateral, medial, temporal, lobe, damage, but, she, was, still, able, to, remember, how, to, perform, some, declarative, skills, she, was, able, to, remember, how, to, read, music, and, the, techniques, used, in, art, she, had, preserved, skill, related, declarative, memory, for, some, things, even, though, she, had, deficits, in, other, declarative, memory, tasks, she, even, scored, higher, on, skill, related, declarative, memory, than, the, control, in, watercolor, techniques, a, technique, that, she, used, in, her, professional, career, before, she, acquired, amnesia, the, loss, of, semantic, information, in, amnesia, is, most, closely, related, with, damage, to, the, medial, temporal, lobe, or, to, the, neocortex, some, patients, with, anterograde, amnesia, can, still, acquire, some, semantic, information, even, though, it, might, be, more, difficult, and, might, remain, rather, unrelated, to, more, general, knowledge, h, m, could, accurately, draw, a, floor, plan, of, the, home, in, which, he, lived, after, surgery, even, though, he, had, not, lived, there, in, years, there, is, evidence, that, the, hippocampus, and, the, medial, temporal, lobe, may, help, to, consolidate, semantic, memories, but, then, they, are, more, correlated, with, the, neocortex, while, lesions, of, the, hippocampus, normally, lead, to, the, loss, of, episodic, memory, if, there, is, any, effect, on, semantic, memory, it, is, more, varied, and, usually, does, not, last, as, long, one, reason, that, patients, could, not, form, new, episodic, memories, is, likely, because, the, ca1, region, of, the, hippocampus, has, a, lesion, and, thus, the, hippocampus, could, not, make, connections, to, the, cortex, after, an, ischemic, episode, an, interruption, of, the, blood, flow, to, the, brain, an, mri, of, patient, r, b, following, surgery, showed, his, hippocampus, to, be, intact, except, for, a, specific, lesion, restricted, to, the, ca1, pyramidal, cells, in, one, instance, transient, global, amnesia, was, caused, by, a, hippocampal, ca1, lesion, while, this, was, a, temporary, case, of, amnesia, it, still, shows, the, importance, of, the, ca1, region, of, the, hippocampus, in, memory, episodic, memory, loss, is, most, likely, to, occur, when, there, has, been, damage, to, the, hippocampus, there, is, evidence, that, damage, to, the, medial, temporal, lobe, correlates, to, a, loss, of, autobiographical, episodic, memory, some, retrograde, and, anterograde, amnesiacs, are, capable, of, non, declarative, memory, including, implicit, learning, and, procedural, learning, for, example, some, patients, show, improvement, on, the, pseudorandom, sequences, experiment, just, as, healthy, people, therefore, procedural, learning, can, proceed, independently, of, the, brain, system, required, for, declarative, memory, some, patients, with, amnesia, are, able, to, remember, skills, that, they, had, learned, without, being, able, to, consciously, recall, where, they, had, learned, that, information, for, example, they, may, learn, to, do, a, task, and, then, be, able, to, perform, the, task, later, without, any, recollection, of, learning, the, task, according, to, fmri, studies, the, acquisition, of, procedural, memories, activates, the, basal, ganglia, the, premotor, cortex, and, the, supplementary, motor, area, regions, which, are, not, normally, associated, with, the, formation, of, declarative, memories, this, type, of, dissociation, between, declarative, and, procedural, memory, can, also, be, found, in, patients, with, diencephalic, amnesia, such, as, korsakoff, s, syndrome, another, example, demonstrated, by, some, patients, such, as, k, c, and, h, m, who, have, medial, temporal, damage, and, anterograde, amnesia, still, have, perceptual, priming, priming, was, accomplished, in, many, different, experiments, of, amnesia, and, it, was, found, that, the, patients, can, be, primed, they, have, no, conscious, recall, of, the, event, but, the, response, is, there, those, patients, did, well, in, the, word, fragment, completion, task, there, is, some, evidence, that, non, declarative, memory, can, be, held, onto, in, the, form, of, motor, skills, this, idea, was, disputed, though, because, it, is, argued, that, motor, skills, require, both, declarative, and, non, declarative, information, there, are, three, generalized, categories, in, which, amnesia, could, be, acquired, by, a, person, the, three, categories, are, head, trauma, example, head, injuries, traumatic, events, example, seeing, something, devastating, to, the, mind, or, physical, deficiencies, example, atrophy, of, the, hippocampus, the, majority, of, amnesia, and, related, memory, issues, derive, from, the, first, two, categories, as, these, are, more, common, and, the, third, could, be, considered, a, subcategory, of, the, first, among, specific, causes, of, amnesia, are, the, following, many, forms, of, amnesia, fix, themselves, without, being, treated, however, there, are, a, few, ways, to, cope, with, memory, loss, if, treatment, is, needed, since, there, are, a, variety, of, causes, that, form, different, amnesia, there, are, different, methods, that, response, better, with, the, certain, type, of, amnesia, emotional, support, and, love, as, well, as, medication, and, psychological, therapy, have, been, proven, effective, one, technique, for, amnesia, treatment, is, cognitive, or, occupational, therapy, in, therapy, amnesiacs, will, develop, the, memory, skills, they, have, and, try, to, regain, some, they, have, lost, by, finding, which, techniques, help, retrieve, memories, or, create, new, retrieval, paths, this, may, also, include, strategies, for, organizing, information, to, remember, it, more, easily, and, for, improving, understanding, of, lengthy, conversation, another, coping, mechanism, is, taking, advantage, of, technological, assistance, such, as, a, personal, digital, device, to, keep, track, of, day, to, day, tasks, reminders, can, be, set, up, for, appointments, when, to, take, medications, birthdays, and, other, important, events, many, pictures, can, also, be, stored, to, help, amnesiacs, remember, names, of, friends, family, and, co, workers, notebooks, wall, calendars, pill, reminders, and, photographs, of, people, and, places, are, low, tech, memory, aids, that, can, help, as, well, while, there, are, no, medications, available, to, treat, amnesia, underlying, medical, conditions, can, be, treated, to, improve, memory, such, conditions, include, but, are, not, limited, to, low, thyroid, function, liver, or, kidney, disease, stroke, depression, bipolar, disorder, and, blood, clots, in, the, brain, wernicke, korsakoff, syndrome, involves, a, lack, of, thiamin, and, replacing, this, vitamin, by, consuming, thiamin, rich, foods, such, as, whole, grain, cereals, legumes, beans, and, lentils, nuts, lean, pork, and, yeast, can, help, treat, it, treating, alcoholism, and, preventing, alcohol, and, illicit, drug, use, can, prevent, further, damage, but, in, most, cases, will, not, recover, lost, memory, although, improvements, occur, when, patients, receive, certain, treatments, there, is, still, no, actual, cure, remedy, for, amnesia, so, far, to, what, extent, the, patient, recovers, and, how, long, the, amnesia, will, continue, depends, on, the, type, and, severity, of, the, lesion, french, psychologist, theodule, armand, ribot, was, among, the, first, scientists, to, study, amnesia, he, proposed, ribot, s, law, which, states, that, there, is, a, time, gradient, in, retrograde, amnesia, the, law, follows, a, logical, progression, of, memory, loss, due, to, disease, first, a, patient, loses, the, recent, memories, then, personal, memories, and, finally, intellectual, memories, he, implied, that, the, most, recent, memories, were, lost, first, case, studies, have, played, a, large, role, in, the, discovery, of, amnesia, and, the, parts, of, the, brain, that, were, affected, the, studies, gave, important, insight, into, how, amnesia, affects, the, brain, the, studies, also, gave, scientists, the, resources, into, improving, their, knowledge, about, amnesia, and, insight, into, a, cure, or, prevention, there, are, several, extremely, important, case, studies, henry, molaison, r, b, and, g, d, henry, molaison, formerly, known, as, h, m, changed, the, way, people, thought, of, memory, the, case, was, first, reported, in, a, paper, by, william, beecher, scoville, and, brenda, milner, in, 1957, he, was, a, patient, who, had, severe, epilepsy, attributed, to, a, bicycle, accident, at, the, age, of, nine, physicians, were, unable, to, control, his, seizures, with, drugs, so, the, neurosurgeon, scoville, tried, a, new, approach, involving, brain, surgery, he, removed, his, medial, temporal, lobe, bilaterally, by, doing, a, temporal, lobectomy, his, epilepsy, did, improve, but, molaison, lost, the, ability, to, form, new, long, term, memories, anterograde, amnesia, he, exhibited, normal, short, term, memory, ability, if, he, was, given, a, list, of, words, he, would, forget, them, in, about, a, minute, s, time, in, fact, he, would, forget, that, he, had, even, been, given, a, list, in, the, first, place, however, h, m, s, working, and, short, term, memory, seemed, to, be, intact, he, had, a, normal, digit, span, and, could, hold, a, conversation, that, did, not, require, him, to, recall, past, parts, of, the, conversation, once, molaison, stopped, thinking, about, the, lists, he, was, unable, to, recall, them, again, from, long, term, memory, this, gave, researchers, evidence, that, short, term, and, long, term, memory, are, in, fact, two, different, processes, even, though, he, forgot, about, the, lists, he, was, still, able, to, learn, things, through, his, implicit, memory, the, psychologists, would, ask, him, to, draw, something, on, a, piece, of, paper, but, to, look, at, the, paper, using, a, mirror, though, he, could, never, remember, ever, doing, that, task, he, would, improve, after, doing, it, over, and, over, again, this, showed, the, psychologists, that, he, was, learning, and, remembering, things, unconsciously, in, some, studies, it, was, found, that, h, m, s, perceptual, learning, was, intact, and, that, his, other, cognitive, skills, were, working, appropriately, it, was, also, found, that, some, people, with, declarative, information, amnesia, are, able, to, be, primed, studies, were, completed, consistently, throughout, molaison, s, lifetime, to, discover, more, about, amnesia, researchers, did, a, 14, year, follow, up, study, on, molaison, they, studied, him, for, a, period, of, two, weeks, to, learn, more, about, his, amnesia, after, 14, years, molaison, still, could, not, recall, things, that, had, happened, since, his, surgery, however, he, could, still, remember, things, that, had, happened, prior, to, the, operation, researchers, also, found, that, when, asked, molaison, could, answer, questions, about, national, or, international, events, but, he, could, not, remember, his, own, personal, memories, after, his, death, molaison, donated, his, brain, to, science, where, they, were, able, to, discover, the, areas, of, the, brain, that, had, the, lesions, which, caused, his, amnesia, particularly, the, medial, temporal, lobe, this, case, study, provided, important, insight, to, the, areas, of, the, brain, that, are, affected, in, anterograde, amnesia, as, well, as, how, amnesia, works, h, m, s, case, showed, that, memory, processes, are, consolidated, into, different, parts, of, the, brain, and, that, short, term, and, working, memory, are, not, usually, impaired, in, cases, of, amnesia, another, famous, historical, case, of, amnesia, was, that, of, clive, wearing, clive, wearing, was, a, conductor, and, musician, who, contracted, herpes, simplex, virus, this, virus, affected, the, hippocampal, regions, of, the, brain, because, of, this, damage, wearing, was, unable, to, remember, information, for, more, than, a, few, moments, wearing, s, non, declarative, memory, was, still, functioning, but, his, declarative, memory, was, impaired, to, him, he, felt, that, he, had, just, come, to, consciousness, for, the, first, time, every, time, he, was, unable, to, hold, on, to, information, this, case, also, can, be, used, as, evidence, that, there, are, different, memory, systems, for, declarative, and, non, declarative, memory, this, case, was, more, evidence, that, the, hippocampus, is, an, important, part, of, the, brain, in, remembering, past, events, and, that, declarative, and, non, declarative, memories, have, different, processes, in, different, parts, of, the, brain, patient, r, b, was, a, normally, functioning, man, until, the, age, of, 52, at, age, 50, he, had, been, diagnosed, with, angina, and, had, surgery, for, heart, problems, on, two, occasions, after, an, ischemic, episode, reduction, of, blood, to, the, brain, that, was, caused, from, a, heart, bypass, surgery, r, b, demonstrated, a, loss, of, anterograde, memory, but, almost, no, loss, of, retrograde, memory, with, the, exception, of, a, couple, of, years, before, his, surgery, and, presented, no, sign, of, any, other, cognitive, impairment, it, was, not, until, after, his, death, that, researchers, had, the, chance, to, examine, his, brain, when, they, found, his, lesions, were, restricted, to, the, ca1, portion, of, the, hippocampus, this, case, study, led, to, important, research, involving, the, role, of, the, hippocampus, and, the, function, of, memory, patient, g, d, was, a, white, male, born, in, 1940, who, served, in, the, navy, he, was, diagnosed, with, chronic, kidney, failure, and, received, hemodialysis, treatment, for, the, rest, of, his, life, in, 1983, he, went, to, the, hospital, for, elective, parathyroidectomy, he, also, had, a, left, thyroid, lobectomy, because, of, severe, loss, of, blood, in, his, left, lobe, he, began, having, cardiac, problems, as, a, result, of, the, surgery, and, became, very, agitated, even, five, days, after, being, released, from, the, hospital, he, was, unable, to, remember, what, had, happened, to, him, aside, from, memory, impairment, none, of, his, other, cognitive, processes, seemed, to, be, affected, he, did, not, want, to, be, involved, in, much, research, but, through, memory, tests, he, took, with, doctors, they, were, able, to, ascertain, that, his, memory, problems, were, present, for, the, next, 9, 5, years, until, his, death, after, he, died, his, brain, was, donated, to, science, photographed, and, preserved, for, future, study, global, amnesia, is, a, common, motif, in, fiction, despite, being, extraordinarily, rare, in, reality, in, the, introduction, to, his, anthology, the, vintage, book, of, amnesia, jonathan, lethem, writes, real, diagnosable, amnesia, people, getting, knocked, on, the, head, and, forgetting, their, names, is, mostly, just, a, rumor, in, the, world, it, s, a, rare, condition, and, usually, a, brief, one, in, books, and, movies, though, versions, of, amnesia, lurk, everywhere, from, episodes, of, mission, impossible, to, metafictional, and, absurdist, masterpieces, with, dozens, of, stops, in, between, amnesiacs, might, not, much, exist, but, amnesiac, characters, stumble, everywhere, through, comic, books, movies, and, our, dreams, we, ve, all, met, them, and, been, them, lethem, traces, the, roots, of, literary, amnesia, to, franz, kafka, and, samuel, beckett, among, others, fueled, in, large, part, by, the, seeping, into, popular, culture, of, the, work, of, sigmund, freud, which, also, strongly, influenced, genre, films, such, as, film, noir, amnesia, is, so, often, used, as, a, plot, device, in, films, that, a, widely, recognized, stereotypical, dialogue, has, even, developed, around, it, with, the, victim, melodramatically, asking, where, am, i, who, am, i, what, am, i, or, sometimes, inquiring, of, their, own, name, bill, who, s, bill, in, movies, and, television, particularly, sitcoms, and, soap, operas, it, is, often, depicted, that, a, second, blow, to, the, head, similar, to, the, first, one, which, caused, the, amnesia, will, then, cure, it, in, reality, however, repeat, concussions, may, cause, cumulative, deficits, including, cognitive, problems, and, in, extremely, rare, cases, may, even, cause, deadly, swelling, of, the, brain, associated, with, second, impact, syndrome, fictional, depictions, of, amnesia, are, almost, universally, retrograde, memento, is, a, rare, example, of, anterograde, amnesia, in, fiction, in, science, fiction, involving, a, masquerade, that, hides, magical, or, alien, societies, from, humanity, such, as, men, in, black, or, the, scp, foundation, fictional, organizations, can, induce, deliberate, amnesia, via, drugs, or, advanced, technology, to, wipe, the, minds, of, those, that, view, supernatural, phenomena, amnesiacs
