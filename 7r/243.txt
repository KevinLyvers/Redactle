of, the, southeastern, woodlands, of, the, united, states, prior, to, the, 18th, century, they, were, concentrated, in, their, homelands, in, towns, along, river, valleys, of, what, is, now, southwestern, north, carolina, southeastern, tennessee, southwestern, virginia, edges, of, western, south, carolina, northern, georgia, and, northeastern, alabama, consisting, of, around, 40, 000, square, miles, the, cherokee, language, is, part, of, the, iroquoian, language, group, in, the, 19th, century, james, mooney, an, early, american, ethnographer, recorded, one, oral, tradition, that, told, of, the, tribe, having, migrated, south, in, ancient, times, from, the, great, lakes, region, where, other, iroquoian, peoples, have, been, based, however, anthropologist, thomas, r, whyte, writing, in, 2007, dated, the, split, among, the, peoples, as, occurring, earlier, he, believes, that, the, origin, of, the, proto, iroquoian, language, was, likely, the, appalachian, region, and, the, split, between, northern, and, southern, iroquoian, languages, began, 4, 000, years, ago, by, the, 19th, century, white, american, settlers, had, classified, the, cherokee, of, the, southeast, as, one, of, the, five, civilized, tribes, in, the, region, they, were, agrarian, lived, in, permanent, villages, and, had, begun, to, adopt, some, cultural, and, technological, practices, of, the, white, settlers, they, also, developed, their, own, writing, system, today, three, cherokee, tribes, are, federally, recognized, the, united, keetoowah, band, of, cherokee, indians, ukb, in, oklahoma, the, cherokee, nation, cn, in, oklahoma, and, the, eastern, band, of, cherokee, indians, ebci, in, north, carolina, the, cherokee, nation, has, more, than, 300, 000, tribal, members, making, it, the, largest, of, the, 574, federally, recognized, tribes, in, the, united, states, in, addition, numerous, groups, claim, cherokee, lineage, and, some, of, these, are, state, recognized, a, total, of, more, than, 819, 000, people, are, estimated, to, have, identified, as, having, cherokee, ancestry, on, the, u, s, census, most, are, not, enrolled, members, of, any, tribe, of, the, three, federally, recognized, cherokee, tribes, the, cherokee, nation, and, the, ukb, have, headquarters, in, tahlequah, oklahoma, and, most, of, their, members, live, in, the, state, the, ukb, are, mostly, descendants, of, old, settlers, also, called, western, cherokee, those, who, migrated, from, the, southeast, to, arkansas, and, oklahoma, in, about, 1817, prior, to, indian, removal, they, are, related, to, the, cherokee, who, were, later, forcibly, relocated, there, in, the, 1830s, under, the, indian, removal, act, the, eastern, band, of, cherokee, indians, is, located, on, land, known, as, the, qualla, boundary, in, western, north, carolina, they, are, mostly, descendants, of, ancestors, who, had, resisted, or, avoided, relocation, remaining, in, the, area, because, they, gave, up, tribal, membership, at, the, time, they, became, state, and, us, citizens, in, the, late, 19th, century, they, reorganized, as, a, federally, recognized, tribe, a, cherokee, language, name, for, cherokee, people, is, aniyvwiya, translating, as, principal, people, another, endonym, is, anigiduwagi, translating, as, people, from, kituwah, tsalagi, gawonihisdi, is, the, cherokee, name, for, the, cherokee, language, many, theories, though, all, unproven, abound, about, the, origin, of, the, name, cherokee, it, may, have, originally, been, derived, from, one, of, the, competitive, tribes, in, the, area, the, earliest, spanish, transliteration, of, the, name, from, 1755, is, recorded, as, tchalaquei, but, it, dates, to, accounts, related, to, the, hernando, de, soto, expedition, in, the, mid, 16th, century, another, theory, is, that, cherokee, derives, from, the, lower, creek, word, cvlakke, chuh, log, gee, as, the, creek, were, also, in, this, mountainous, region, the, iroquois, five, nations, historically, based, in, new, york, and, pennsylvania, called, the, cherokee, oyata, ge, rono, inhabitants, of, the, cave, country, it, is, possible, the, word, cherokee, comes, from, a, muscogee, creek, word, meaning, people, of, different, speech, because, the, two, peoples, spoke, different, languages, jack, kilpatrick, disputes, this, idea, noting, that, he, believes, the, name, come, from, the, cherokee, word, ts, dlag, meaning, he, has, turned, aside, anthropologists, and, historians, have, two, main, theories, of, cherokee, origins, one, is, that, the, cherokee, an, iroquoian, speaking, people, are, relative, latecomers, to, southern, appalachia, who, may, have, migrated, in, late, prehistoric, times, from, northern, areas, around, the, great, lakes, this, has, been, the, traditional, territory, of, the, haudenosaunee, nations, and, other, iroquoian, speaking, peoples, another, theory, is, that, the, cherokee, had, been, in, the, southeast, for, thousands, of, years, and, that, proto, iroquoian, developed, here, other, iroquoian, speaking, tribes, in, the, southeast, have, been, the, tuscarora, people, of, the, carolinas, and, the, meherrin, and, nottaway, of, virginia, james, mooney, in, the, late, 19th, century, recorded, conversations, with, elders, who, recounted, an, oral, tradition, of, the, cherokee, people, migrating, south, from, the, great, lakes, region, in, ancient, times, they, occupied, territories, where, earthwork, platform, mounds, were, built, by, peoples, during, the, earlier, woodland, and, mississippian, culture, periods, for, example, the, people, of, the, connestee, culture, period, are, believed, to, be, ancestors, of, the, historic, cherokee, and, occupied, what, is, now, western, north, carolina, in, the, middle, woodland, period, circa, 200, to, 600, ce, they, are, believed, to, have, built, what, is, called, the, biltmore, mound, found, in, 1984, south, of, the, swannanoa, river, on, the, biltmore, estate, which, has, numerous, native, american, sites, other, ancestors, of, the, cherokee, are, considered, to, be, part, of, the, later, pisgah, phase, of, south, appalachian, mississippian, culture, a, regional, variation, of, the, mississippian, culture, that, arose, circa, 1000, and, lasted, to, 1500, ce, there, is, a, consensus, among, most, specialists, in, southeast, archeology, and, anthropology, about, these, dates, but, finger, says, that, ancestors, of, the, cherokee, people, lived, in, western, north, carolina, and, eastern, tennessee, for, a, far, longer, period, of, time, additional, mounds, were, built, by, peoples, during, this, cultural, phase, typically, in, this, region, towns, had, a, single, platform, mound, and, served, as, a, political, center, for, smaller, villages, the, cherokee, occupied, numerous, towns, throughout, the, river, valleys, and, mountain, ridges, of, their, homelands, what, were, called, the, lower, towns, were, found, in, what, is, present, day, western, oconee, county, south, carolina, along, the, keowee, river, called, the, savannah, river, in, its, lower, portion, the, principal, town, of, the, lower, towns, was, keowee, other, cherokee, towns, on, the, keowee, river, included, estatoe, and, sugartown, kulsetsiyi, a, name, repeated, in, other, areas, in, western, north, carolina, what, were, known, as, the, valley, middle, and, outer, towns, were, located, along, the, major, rivers, of, the, tuckasegee, the, upper, little, tennessee, hiwasee, french, broad, and, other, systems, the, overhill, cherokee, occupied, towns, along, the, lower, little, tennessee, river, and, upper, tennessee, river, on, the, western, side, of, the, appalachian, mountains, in, present, day, southeastern, tennessee, during, the, late, archaic, and, woodland, period, native, americans, in, the, region, began, to, cultivate, plants, such, as, marsh, elder, lambsquarters, pigweed, sunflowers, and, some, native, squash, people, created, new, art, forms, such, as, shell, gorgets, adopted, new, technologies, and, developed, an, elaborate, cycle, of, religious, ceremonies, during, the, mississippian, culture, period, 1000, to, 1500, ce, in, the, regional, variation, known, as, the, south, appalachian, mississippian, culture, local, women, developed, a, new, variety, of, maize, corn, called, eastern, flint, corn, it, closely, resembled, modern, corn, and, produced, larger, crops, the, successful, cultivation, of, corn, surpluses, allowed, the, rise, of, larger, more, complex, chiefdoms, consisting, of, several, villages, and, concentrated, populations, during, this, period, corn, became, celebrated, among, numerous, peoples, in, religious, ceremonies, especially, the, green, corn, ceremony, much, of, what, is, known, about, pre, 18th, century, native, american, cultures, has, come, from, records, of, spanish, expeditions, the, earliest, ones, of, the, mid, 16th, century, encountered, peoples, of, the, mississippian, culture, era, who, were, ancestral, to, tribes, that, emerged, in, the, southeast, such, as, the, cherokee, muscogee, cheraw, and, catawba, specifically, in, 1540, 41, a, spanish, expedition, led, by, hernando, de, soto, passed, through, present, day, south, carolina, proceeding, into, western, north, carolina, and, what, is, considered, cherokee, country, the, spanish, recorded, a, chalaque, people, as, living, around, the, keowee, river, where, western, north, carolina, south, carolina, and, northeastern, georgia, meet, the, cherokee, consider, this, area, to, be, part, of, their, homelands, which, also, extended, into, southeastern, tennessee, further, west, de, soto, s, expedition, visited, villages, in, present, day, northwestern, georgia, recording, them, as, ruled, at, the, time, by, the, coosa, chiefdom, this, is, believed, to, be, a, chiefdom, ancestral, to, the, muscogee, creek, people, who, developed, as, a, muskogean, speaking, people, with, a, distinct, culture, in, 1566, the, juan, pardo, expedition, traveled, from, the, present, day, south, carolina, coast, into, its, interior, and, into, western, north, carolina, and, southeastern, tennessee, he, recorded, meeting, cherokee, speaking, people, who, visited, him, while, he, stayed, at, the, joara, chiefdom, north, of, present, day, morganton, north, carolina, the, historic, catawba, later, lived, in, this, area, of, the, upper, catawba, river, pardo, and, his, forces, wintered, over, at, joara, building, fort, san, juan, there, in, 1567, his, expedition, proceeded, into, the, interior, noting, villages, near, modern, asheville, and, other, places, that, are, part, of, the, cherokee, homelands, according, to, anthropologist, charles, m, hudson, the, pardo, expedition, also, recorded, encounters, with, muskogean, speaking, peoples, at, chiaha, in, southeastern, modern, tennessee, linguistic, studies, have, been, another, way, for, researchers, to, study, the, development, of, people, and, their, cultures, unlike, most, other, native, american, tribes, in, the, american, southeast, at, the, start, of, the, historic, era, the, cherokee, and, tuscarora, people, spoke, iroquoian, languages, since, the, great, lakes, region, was, the, territory, of, most, iroquoian, language, speakers, scholars, have, theorized, that, both, the, cherokee, and, tuscarora, migrated, south, from, that, region, the, cherokee, oral, history, tradition, supports, their, migration, from, the, great, lakes, linguistic, analysis, shows, a, relatively, large, difference, between, cherokee, and, the, northern, iroquoian, languages, suggesting, they, had, migrated, long, ago, scholars, posit, a, split, between, the, groups, in, the, distant, past, perhaps, 3, 500, 3, 800, years, ago, glottochronology, studies, suggest, the, split, occurred, between, about, 1500, and, 1800, bce, the, cherokee, say, that, the, ancient, settlement, of, kituwa, on, the, tuckasegee, river, is, their, original, settlement, in, the, southeast, it, was, formerly, adjacent, to, and, is, now, part, of, qualla, boundary, the, base, of, the, federally, recognized, eastern, band, of, cherokee, indians, in, north, carolina, according, to, thomas, whyte, who, posits, that, proto, iroquoian, developed, in, appalachia, the, cherokee, and, tuscarora, broke, off, in, the, southeast, from, the, major, group, of, iroquoian, speakers, who, migrated, north, to, the, great, lakes, area, there, a, succession, of, iroquoian, speaking, tribes, were, encountered, by, europeans, in, historic, times, in, the, 1830s, the, american, writer, john, howard, payne, visited, cherokee, then, based, in, georgia, he, recounted, what, they, shared, about, pre, 19th, century, cherokee, culture, and, society, for, instance, the, payne, papers, describe, the, account, by, cherokee, elders, of, a, traditional, two, part, societal, structure, a, white, organization, of, elders, represented, the, seven, clans, as, payne, recounted, this, group, which, was, hereditary, and, priestly, was, responsible, for, religious, activities, such, as, healing, purification, and, prayer, a, second, group, of, younger, men, the, red, organization, was, responsible, for, warfare, the, cherokee, considered, warfare, a, polluting, activity, researchers, have, debated, the, reasons, for, the, change, some, historians, believe, the, decline, in, priestly, power, originated, with, a, revolt, by, the, cherokee, against, the, abuses, of, the, priestly, class, known, as, the, ani, kutani, ethnographer, james, mooney, who, studied, and, talked, with, the, cherokee, in, the, late, 1880s, was, the, first, to, trace, the, decline, of, the, former, hierarchy, to, this, revolt, by, the, time, that, mooney, was, studying, the, people, in, the, late, 1880s, the, structure, of, cherokee, religious, practitioners, was, more, informal, based, more, on, individual, knowledge, and, ability, than, upon, heredity, another, major, source, of, early, cultural, history, comes, from, materials, written, in, the, 19th, century, by, the, didanvwisgi, cherokee, medicine, men, after, sequoyah, s, creation, of, the, cherokee, syllabary, in, the, 1820s, initially, only, the, didanvwisgi, learned, to, write, and, read, such, materials, which, were, considered, extremely, powerful, in, a, spiritual, sense, later, the, syllabary, and, writings, were, widely, adopted, by, the, cherokee, people, in, 1657, there, was, a, disturbance, in, virginia, colony, as, the, rechahecrians, or, rickahockans, as, well, as, the, siouan, manahoac, and, nahyssan, broke, through, the, frontier, and, settled, near, the, falls, of, the, james, river, near, present, day, richmond, virginia, the, following, year, a, combined, force, of, english, colonists, and, pamunkey, drove, the, newcomers, away, the, identity, of, the, rechahecrians, has, been, much, debated, historians, noted, the, name, closely, resembled, that, recorded, for, the, eriechronon, or, erielhonan, commonly, known, as, the, erie, tribe, another, iroquoian, speaking, people, based, south, of, the, great, lakes, in, present, day, northern, pennsylvania, this, iroquoian, people, had, been, driven, away, from, the, southern, shore, of, lake, erie, in, 1654, by, the, powerful, iroquois, five, nations, also, known, as, haudenosaunee, who, were, seeking, more, hunting, grounds, to, support, their, dominance, in, the, beaver, fur, trade, the, anthropologist, martin, smith, theorized, some, remnants, of, the, tribe, migrated, to, virginia, after, the, wars, 1986, 131, 32, later, becoming, known, as, the, westo, to, english, colonists, in, the, province, of, carolina, a, few, historians, suggest, this, tribe, was, cherokee, virginian, traders, developed, a, small, scale, trading, system, with, the, cherokee, in, the, piedmont, before, the, end, of, the, 17th, century, the, earliest, recorded, virginia, trader, to, live, among, the, cherokee, was, cornelius, dougherty, or, dority, in, 1690, the, cherokee, gave, sanctuary, to, a, band, of, shawnee, in, the, 1660s, but, from, 1710, to, 1715, the, cherokee, and, chickasaw, allied, with, the, british, and, fought, the, shawnee, who, were, allied, with, french, colonists, forcing, the, shawnee, to, move, northward, the, cherokee, fought, with, the, yamasee, catawba, and, british, in, late, 1712, and, early, 1713, against, the, tuscarora, in, the, second, tuscarora, war, the, tuscarora, war, marked, the, beginning, of, a, british, cherokee, relationship, that, despite, breaking, down, on, occasion, remained, strong, for, much, of, the, 18th, century, with, the, growth, of, the, deerskin, trade, the, cherokee, were, considered, valuable, trading, partners, since, deer, skins, from, the, cooler, country, of, their, mountain, hunting, grounds, were, of, better, quality, than, those, supplied, by, the, lowland, coastal, tribes, who, were, neighbors, of, the, english, colonists, in, january, 1716, cherokee, murdered, a, delegation, of, muscogee, creek, leaders, at, the, town, of, tugaloo, marking, their, entry, into, the, yamasee, war, it, ended, in, 1717, with, peace, treaties, between, the, colony, of, south, carolina, and, the, creek, hostility, and, sporadic, raids, between, the, cherokee, and, creek, continued, for, decades, these, raids, came, to, a, head, at, the, battle, of, taliwa, in, 1755, at, present, day, ball, ground, georgia, with, the, defeat, of, the, muscogee, in, 1721, the, cherokee, ceded,

sequoyah, began, developing, a, written, form, of, the, cherokee, language, he, spoke, no, english, but, his, experiences, as, a, silversmith, dealing, regularly, with, white, settlers, and, as, a, warrior, at, horseshoe, bend, convinced, him, the, cherokee, needed, to, develop, writing, in, 1821, he, introduced, cherokee, syllabary, the, first, written, syllabic, form, of, an, american, indian, language, outside, of, central, america, initially, his, innovation, was, opposed, by, both, cherokee, traditionalists, and, white, missionaries, who, sought, to, encourage, the, use, of, english, when, sequoyah, taught, children, to, read, and, write, with, the, syllabary, he, reached, the, adults, by, the, 1820s, the, cherokee, had, a, higher, rate, of, literacy, than, the, whites, around,

territory, these, were, the, old, settlers, the, first, of, the, cherokee, to, make, their, way, to, what, would, eventually, become, indian, territory, modern, day, oklahoma, this, effort, was, headed, by, indian, agent, return, j, meigs, and, was, finalized, with, the, signing, of, the, jackson, and, mcminn, treaty, giving, the, old, settlers, undisputed, title, to, the, lands, designated,

claimed, the, removal, policy, was, an, effort, to, prevent, the, cherokee, from, facing, extinction, as, a, people, which, he, considered, the, fate, that, the, mohegan, the, narragansett, and, the, delaware, had, suffered, there, is, however, ample, evidence, that, the, cherokee, were, adapting, to, modern, farming, techniques, a, modern, analysis, shows, that, the, area, was, in, general, in, a, state, of, economic, surplus, and, could, have, accommodated, both, the, cherokee, and, new, settlers, the, cherokee, brought, their, grievances, to, a, us, judicial, review, that, set, a,

surrendered, at, appomattox, stand, watie, became, the, last, confederate, general, to, stand, down, after, the, civil, war, the, u, s, government, required, the, cherokee, nation, to, sign, a, new, treaty, because, of, its, alliance, with, the, confederacy, the, u, s, required, the, 1866, treaty, to, provide, for, the, emancipation, of, all, cherokee, slaves, and, full, citizenship, to, all, cherokee, freedmen, and, all, african, americans, who, chose, to, continue, to, reside, within, tribal, lands, so, that, they, shall, have, all, the, rights, of, native, cherokees, both, before, and,

within, the, tribe, the, us, government, also, acquired, easement, rights, to, the, western, part, of, the, territory, which, became, the, oklahoma, territory, for, the, construction, of, railroads, development, and, settlers, followed, the, railroads, by, the, late, 19th, century, the, government, believed, that, native, americans, would, be, better, off, if, each, family, owned, its, own, land, the, dawes, act, of, 1887, provided, for, the, breakup, of, commonly, held, tribal, land, into, individual, household, allotments, native, americans, were, registered, on, the, dawes, rolls, and, allotted, land, from, the, common, reserve, the, u, s, government, counted, the, remainder, of, tribal, land, as, surplus, and, sold, it, to, non, cherokee, individuals, the, curtis, act, of, 1898, dismantled, tribal, governments, courts, schools, and, other, civic, institutions, for, indian, territory, this, meant, the, abolition, of, the, cherokee, courts, and, governmental, systems, this, was, seen, as, necessary, before, the, oklahoma, and, indian, territories, could, be, admitted, as, a, combined, state, in, 1905, the, five, civilized, tribes, of, the, indian, territory, proposed, the, creation, of, the, state, of, sequoyah, as, one, to, be, exclusively, native, american, but, failed, to, gain, support, in, washington, d, c, in, 1907, the, oklahoma, and, indian, territories, entered, the, union, as, the, state, of, oklahoma, by, the, late, 19th, century, the, eastern, band, of, cherokee, were, laboring, under, the, constraints, of, a, segregated, society, in, the, aftermath, of, reconstruction, conservative, white, democrats, regained, power, in, north, carolina, and, other, southern, states, they, proceeded, to, effectively, disenfranchise, all, blacks, and, many, poor, whites, by, new, constitutions, and, laws, related, to, voter, registration, and, elections, they, passed, jim, crow, laws, that, divided, society, into, white, and, colored, mostly, to, control, freedmen, cherokee, and, other, native, americans, were, classified, on, the, colored, side, and, suffered, the, same, racial, segregation, and, disenfranchisement, as, former, slaves, they, also, often, lost, their, historical, documentation, for, identification, as, indians, when, the, southern, states, classified, them, as, colored, blacks, and, native, americans, would, not, have, their, constitutional, rights, as, u, s, citizens, enforced, until, after, the, civil, rights, movement, secured, passage, of, civil, rights, legislation, in, the, mid, 1960s, and, the, federal, government, began, to, monitor, voter, registration, and, elections, as, well, as, other, programs, on, july, 9, 2020, the, united, states, supreme, court, decided, in, the, mcgirt, v, oklahoma, decision, in, a, criminal, jurisdiction, case, that, roughly, half, the, land, of, the, state, of, oklahoma, made, up, of, tribal, nations, like, the, cherokee, are, officially, native, american, tribal, land, jurisdictions, oklahoma, governor, kevin, stitt, himself, a, cherokee, nation, citizen, sought, to, reverse, the, supreme, court, decision, the, following, year, the, state, of, oklahoma, couldn, t, block, federal, action, to, grant, the, cherokee, nation, along, with, the, chickasaw, choctaw, muscogee, creek, and, seminole, nations, reservation, status, john, r, swanton, enumerates, 201, cherokee, villages, and, towns, the, cherokee, had, 6, 000, warriors, and, therefore, around, 30, 000, people, in, years, 1730, 35, according, to, j, adair, in, 1738, they, also, had, 6, 000, warriors, but, down, to, 5, 000, in, 1740, according, to, ga, hist, coll, ii, colonel, james, oglethorpe, confirms, that, they, had, 5, 000, warriors, in, 1739, ga, coll, rec, v, also, according, to, ga, coll, rec, v, an, epidemic, reduced, them, by, almost, one, half, in, 1738, but, this, source, doesn, t, specify, how, numerous, they, were, before, the, epidemic, perhaps, this, source, exaggerates, the, casualties, caused, by, that, epidemic, and, in, fact, it, killed, just, around, 1, 000, warriors, arthur, dobbs, estimated, the, cherokee, warrior, strength, in, 1755, at, 2, 590, but, w, douglas, at, about, the, same, time, reported, 6, 000, warriors, in, 1761, soon, after, the, end, of, the, anglo, cherokee, war, there, were, 2, 300, warriors, according, to, j, adair, by, year, 1768, their, number, recovered, back, to, 3, 000, warriors, and, b, r, carroll, in, historical, collections, of, south, carolina, also, reported, that, they, had, 3, 000, warriors, by, 1819, there, were, 4, 000, warriors, and, therefore, around, 20, 000, people, including, about, 5, 000, to, the, west, of, the, mississippi, george, catlin, estimated, 22, 000, cherokees, in, 1832, before, their, removal, but, according, to, a, report, by, the, commissioner, of, indian, affairs, dated, november, 25, 1841, the, number, of, cherokees, who, had, already, been, removed, west, of, the, mississippi, to, oklahoma, indian, territory, was, 25, 911, henry, schoolcraft, reported, 21, 707, cherokees, in, 1857, indian, affairs, 1861, reported, 22, 000, enumeration, published, in, 1886, counted, 23, 000, cherokee, in, oklahoma, indian, territory, as, of, year, 1884, indian, affairs, reported, in, 1890, around, 25, 000, among, the, western, cherokee, in, oklahoma, and, in, years, 1884, and, 1889, around, 3, 000, among, the, eastern, cherokee, the, cherokee, national, census, of, 1890, in, oklahoma, gave, the, total, number, of, the, nation, under, cherokee, law, to, be, 25, 978, in, 1900, there, were, 35, 000, in, oklahoma, according, to, james, mooney, quoted, by, frederick, webb, hodge, the, majority, of, the, earlier, estimates, of, the, cherokee, population, are, probably, too, low, as, the, cherokee, occupied, so, extensive, a, territory, that, only, a, part, of, them, came, into, contact, with, the, whites, indian, affairs, 1910, reported, that, in, 1910, the, cherokee, in, oklahoma, contained, 41, 701, people, including, 36, 301, by, blood, 286, by, intermarriage, and, 4, 917, freedmen, while, the, census, of, 1910, counted, 31, 489, cherokees, in, the, 2020, census, a, total, of, 1, 130, 730, people, claimed, cherokee, ancestry, however, the, percentage, of, full, blood, individuals, is, probably, very, low, considering, that, the, eastern, band, of, cherokee, indians, reported, having, only, 395, full, blood, members, perhaps, there, is, a, larger, number, of, full, blood, individuals, among, the, united, keetoowah, band, and, among, the, cherokee, nation, the, cherokee, believe, that, the, world, is, divided, into, two, major, spiritual, forces, red, war, success, youth, and, white, peace, instrospection, old, age, the, qualla, arts, and, crafts, mutual, inc, of, cherokee, north, carolina, is, the, oldest, continuing, native, american, art, co, operative, they, were, founded, in, 1946, to, provide, a, venue, for, traditional, eastern, band, cherokee, artists, the, museum, of, the, cherokee, indian, also, in, cherokee, displays, permanent, and, changing, exhibits, houses, archives, and, collections, important, to, cherokee, history, and, sponsors, cultural, groups, such, as, the, warriors, of, the, anikituhwa, dance, group, in, 2007, the, eastern, band, of, cherokee, indians, entered, into, a, partnership, with, southwestern, community, college, and, western, carolina, university, to, create, the, oconaluftee, institute, for, cultural, arts, oica, to, emphasize, native, art, and, culture, in, traditional, fine, arts, education, this, is, intended, both, to, preserve, traditional, art, forms, and, encourage, exploration, of, contemporary, ideas, located, in, cherokee, oica, offered, an, associate, degree, program, in, august, 2010, oica, acquired, a, letterpress, and, had, the, cherokee, syllabary, recast, to, begin, printing, one, of, a, kind, fine, art, books, and, prints, in, the, cherokee, language, in, 2012, the, fine, art, degree, program, at, oica, was, incorporated, into, southwestern, community, college, and, moved, to, the, scc, swain, center, where, it, continues, to, operate, the, cherokee, heritage, center, of, park, hill, oklahoma, is, the, site, of, a, reproduction, of, an, ancient, cherokee, village, adams, rural, village, including, 19th, century, buildings, nofire, farms, and, the, cherokee, family, research, center, for, genealogy, the, cherokee, heritage, center, also, houses, the, cherokee, national, archives, both, the, cherokee, nation, of, oklahoma, and, the, united, keetoowah, band, of, cherokee, as, well, as, other, tribes, contribute, funding, to, the, chc, before, the, 19th, century, polygamy, was, common, among, the, cherokee, especially, by, elite, men, the, matrilineal, culture, meant, that, women, controlled, property, such, as, their, dwellings, and, their, children, were, considered, born, into, their, mother, s, clan, where, they, gained, hereditary, status, advancement, to, leadership, positions, was, generally, subject, to, approval, by, the, women, elders, in, addition, the, society, was, matrifocal, customarily, a, married, couple, lived, with, or, near, the, woman, s, family, so, she, could, be, aided, by, her, female, relatives, her, eldest, brother, was, a, more, important, mentor, to, her, sons, than, was, their, father, who, belonged, to, another, clan, traditionally, couples, particularly, women, can, divorce, freely, it, was, unusual, for, a, cherokee, man, to, marry, a, european, american, woman, the, children, of, such, a, union, were, disadvantaged, as, they, would, not, belong, to, the, nation, they, would, be, born, outside, the, clans, and, traditionally, were, not, considered, cherokee, citizens, this, is, because, of, the, matrilineal, aspect, of, cherokee, culture, as, the, cherokee, began, to, adopt, some, elements, of, european, american, culture, in, the, early, 19th, century, they, sent, elite, young, men, such, as, john, ridge, and, elias, boudinot, to, american, schools, for, education, after, ridge, had, married, a, european, american, woman, from, connecticut, and, boudinot, was, engaged, to, another, the, cherokee, council, in, 1825, passed, a, law, making, children, of, such, unions, full, citizens, of, the, tribe, as, if, their, mothers, were, cherokee, this, was, a, way, to, protect, the, families, of, men, expected, to, be, leaders, of, the, tribe, in, the, late, nineteenth, century, the, u, s, government, put, new, restrictions, on, marriage, between, a, cherokee, and, non, cherokee, although, it, was, still, relatively, common, a, european, american, man, could, legally, marry, a, cherokee, woman, by, petitioning, the, federal, court, after, gaining, the, approval, of, ten, of, her, blood, relatives, once, married, the, man, had, status, as, an, intermarried, white, a, member, of, the, cherokee, tribe, with, restricted, rights, for, instance, he, could, not, hold, any, tribal, office, he, remained, a, citizen, of, and, under, the, laws, of, the, united, states, common, law, marriages, were, more, popular, such, intermarried, whites, were, listed, in, a, separate, category, on, the, registers, of, the, dawes, rolls, prepared, for, allotment, of, plots, of, land, to, individual, households, of, members, of, the, tribe, in, the, early, twentieth, century, federal, policy, for, assimilation, of, the, native, americans, ethnobotany, is, the, study, of, interrelations, between, humans, and, plants, however, current, use, of, the, term, implies, the, study, of, indigenous, or, traditional, knowledge, of, plants, it, involves, the, indigenous, knowledge, of, plant, classification, cultivation, and, use, as, food, medicine, and, shelter, men, and, women, have, historically, played, important, yet, at, times, different, roles, in, cherokee, society, historically, women, have, primarily, been, the, heads, of, households, owning, the, home, and, the, land, farmers, of, the, family, s, land, and, mothers, of, the, clans, as, in, many, native, american, cultures, cherokee, women, are, honored, as, life, givers, as, givers, and, nurturers, of, life, via, childbirth, and, the, growing, of, plants, and, community, leaders, as, clan, mothers, women, are, traditionally, community, leaders, in, cherokee, communities, some, have, served, as, warriors, both, historically, and, in, contemporary, culture, in, military, service, cherokee, women, are, regarded, as, tradition, keepers, and, responsible, for, cultural, preservation, the, redefining, of, gender, roles, in, cherokee, society, first, occurred, in, the, time, period, between, 1776, and, 1835, this, period, is, demarcated, by, the, de, soto, exploration, and, subsequent, invasion, was, followed, by, the, american, revolution, in, 1776, and, culminated, with, the, signing, of, treaty, of, new, echota, in, 1835, the, purpose, of, this, redefinition, was, to, push, european, social, standards, and, norms, on, the, cherokee, people, the, long, lasting, effect, of, these, practices, reorganized, cherokee, forms, of, government, towards, a, male, dominated, society, which, has, affected, the, nation, for, generations, miles, argues, white, agents, were, mainly, responsible, for, the, shifting, of, cherokee, attitudes, toward, women, s, role, in, politics, and, domestic, spaces, these, white, agents, could, be, identified, as, white, missionaries, and, white, settlers, seeking, out, manifest, destiny, by, the, time, of, removal, in, the, mid, 1830s, cherokee, men, and, women, had, begun, to, fulfill, different, roles, and, expectations, as, defined, by, the, civilization, program, promoted, by, us, presidents, washington, and, jefferson, while, there, is, a, record, of, a, non, native, traveler, in, 1825, noticing, what, he, considered, to, be, men, who, assumed, the, dress, and, performed, the, duties, of, women, this, observer, was, unfamiliar, with, how, the, natives, in, that, region, dressed, there, is, no, evidence, of, what, would, now, be, considered, two, spirit, individuals, in, cherokee, society, this, is, generally, the, case, in, matriarchal, and, matrilineal, cultures, as, third, gender, roles, are, usually, found, in, patriarchal, societies, and, cultures, with, more, rigid, gender, roles, slavery, was, a, component, of, cherokee, society, prior, to, european, colonization, as, they, frequently, enslaved, enemy, captives, taken, during, times, of, conflict, with, other, indigenous, tribes, by, their, oral, tradition, the, cherokee, viewed, slavery, as, the, result, of, an, individual, s, failure, in, warfare, and, as, a, temporary, status, pending, release, or, the, slave, s, adoption, into, the, tribe, during, the, colonial, era, carolinian, settlers, purchased, or, impressed, cherokees, as, slaves, during, the, late, 17th, and, early, 18th, century, the, cherokee, were, also, among, the, native, american, peoples, who, sold, indian, slaves, to, traders, for, use, as, laborers, in, virginia, and, further, north, they, took, them, as, captives, in, raids, on, enemy, tribes, as, the, cherokee, began, to, adopt, some, european, american, customs, they, began, to, purchase, enslaved, african, americans, to, serve, as, workers, on, their, farms, or, plantations, which, some, of, the, elite, families, had, in, the, antebellum, years, when, the, cherokee, were, forcibly, removed, on, the, trail, of, tears, they, took, slaves, with, them, and, acquired, others, in, indian, territory, the, cherokee, speak, a, southern, iroquoian, language, which, is, polysynthetic, and, is, written, in, a, syllabary, invented, by, sequoyah, in, the, 1810s, for, years, many, people, wrote, and, transliterated, cherokee, or, used, poor, intercompatible, fonts, to, type, out, the, syllabary, however, since, the, fairly, recent, addition, of, the, cherokee, syllables, to, unicode, the, cherokee, language, is, experiencing, a, renaissance, in, its, use, on, the, internet, because, of, the, polysynthetic, nature, of, the, cherokee, language, new, and, descriptive, words, in, cherokee, are, easily, constructed, to, reflect, or, express, modern, concepts, examples, include, ditiyohihi, which, means, he, argues, repeatedly, and, on, purpose, with, a, purpose, meaning, attorney, another, example, is, didaniyisgi, which, means, he, catches, them, finally, and, conclusively, meaning, policeman, many, words, however, have, been, borrowed, from, the, english, language, such, as, gasoline, which, in, cherokee, is, ga, so, li, ne, many, other, words, were, borrowed, from, the, languages, of, tribes, who, settled, in, oklahoma, in, the, early, 20th, century, one, example, relates, to, a, town, in, oklahoma, named, nowata, the, word, nowata, is, a, delaware, indian, word, for, welcome, more, precisely, the, delaware, word, is, nu, wi, ta, which, can, mean, welcome, or, friend, in, the, delaware, language, the, white, settlers, of, the, area, used, the, name, nowata, for, the, township, and, local, cherokees, being, unaware, the, word, had, its, origins, in, the, delaware, language, called, the, town, amadikanigvnagvna, which, means, the, water, is, all, gone, from, here, i, e, no, water, other, examples, of, borrowed, words, are, kawi, for, coffee, and, watsi, for, watch, which, led, to, utana, watsi, or, big, watch, for, clock, the, following, table, is, an, example, of, cherokee, text, and, its, translation, the, cherokee, have, participated, in, at, least, thirty, six, treaties, in, the, past, three, hundred, years, after, being, ravaged, by, smallpox, and, feeling, pressure, from, european, settlers, the, cherokee, adopted, a, european, american, representative, democracy, form, of, government, in, an, effort, to, retain, their, lands, they, established, a, governmental, system, modeled, on, that, of, the, united, states, with, an, elected, principal, chief, senate, and, house, of, representatives, on, april, 10, 1810, the, seven, cherokee, clans, met, and, began, the, abolition, of, blood, vengeance, by, giving, the, sacred, duty, to, the, new, cherokee, national, government, clans, formally, relinquished, judicial, responsibilities, by, the, 1820s, when, the, cherokee, supreme, court, was, established, in, 1825, the, national, council, extended, citizenship, to, the, children, of, cherokee, men, married, to, white, women, these, ideas, were, largely, incorporated, into, the, 1827, cherokee, constitution, the, constitution, stated, that, no, person, who, is, of, negro, or, mulatto, parentage, either, by, the, father, or, mother, side, shall, be, eligible, to, hold, any, office,
