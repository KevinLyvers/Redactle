a, creole, language, or, simply, creole, is, a, stable, natural, language, that, develops, from, the, process, of, different, languages, simplifying, and, mixing, into, a, new, form, often, a, pidgin, and, then, that, form, expanding, and, elaborating, into, a, full, fledged, language, with, native, speakers, all, within, a, fairly, brief, period, while, the, concept, is, similar, to, that, of, a, mixed, or, hybrid, language, creoles, are, often, characterized, by, a, tendency, to, systematize, their, inherited, grammar, e, g, by, eliminating, irregularities, or, regularizing, the, conjugation, of, otherwise, irregular, verbs, like, any, language, creoles, are, characterized, by, a, consistent, system, of, grammar, possess, large, stable, vocabularies, and, are, acquired, by, children, as, their, native, language, these, three, features, distinguish, a, creole, language, from, a, pidgin, creolistics, or, creology, is, the, study, of, creole, languages, and, as, such, is, a, subfield, of, linguistics, someone, who, engages, in, this, study, is, called, a, creolist, the, precise, number, of, creole, languages, is, not, known, particularly, as, many, are, poorly, attested, or, documented, about, one, hundred, creole, languages, have, arisen, since, 1500, these, are, predominantly, based, on, european, languages, such, as, english, and, french, due, to, the, european, age, of, discovery, and, the, atlantic, slave, trade, that, arose, at, that, time, with, the, improvements, in, ship, building, and, navigation, traders, had, to, learn, to, communicate, with, people, around, the, world, and, the, quickest, way, to, do, this, was, to, develop, a, pidgin, in, turn, full, creole, languages, developed, from, these, pidgins, in, addition, to, creoles, that, have, european, languages, as, their, base, there, are, for, example, creoles, based, on, arabic, chinese, and, malay, the, lexicon, of, a, creole, language, is, largely, supplied, by, the, parent, languages, particularly, that, of, the, most, dominant, group, in, the, social, context, of, the, creole, s, construction, however, there, are, often, clear, phonetic, and, semantic, shifts, on, the, other, hand, the, grammar, that, has, evolved, often, has, new, or, unique, features, that, differ, substantially, from, those, of, the, parent, languages, a, creole, is, believed, to, arise, when, a, pidgin, developed, by, adults, for, use, as, a, second, language, becomes, the, native, and, primary, language, of, their, children, a, process, known, as, nativization, the, pidgin, creole, life, cycle, was, studied, by, american, linguist, robert, hall, in, the, 1960s, some, linguists, such, as, derek, bickerton, posit, that, creoles, share, more, grammatical, similarities, with, each, other, than, with, the, languages, from, which, they, are, phylogenetically, derived, however, there, is, no, widely, accepted, theory, that, would, account, for, those, perceived, similarities, moreover, no, grammatical, feature, has, been, shown, to, be, specific, to, creoles, many, of, the, creoles, known, today, arose, in, the, last, 500, years, as, a, result, of, the, worldwide, expansion, of, european, maritime, power, and, trade, in, the, age, of, discovery, which, led, to, extensive, european, colonial, empires, like, most, non, official, and, minority, languages, creoles, have, generally, been, regarded, in, popular, opinion, as, degenerate, variants, or, dialects, of, their, parent, languages, because, of, that, prejudice, many, of, the, creoles, that, arose, in, the, european, colonies, having, been, stigmatized, have, become, extinct, however, political, and, academic, changes, in, recent, decades, have, improved, the, status, of, creoles, both, as, living, languages, and, as, object, of, linguistic, study, some, creoles, have, even, been, granted, the, status, of, official, or, semi, official, languages, of, particular, political, territories, linguists, now, recognize, that, creole, formation, is, a, universal, phenomenon, not, limited, to, the, european, colonial, period, and, an, important, aspect, of, language, evolution, other, scholars, such, as, salikoko, mufwene, argue, that, pidgins, and, creoles, arise, independently, under, different, circumstances, and, that, a, pidgin, need, not, always, precede, a, creole, nor, a, creole, evolve, from, a, pidgin, pidgins, according, to, mufwene, emerged, in, trade, colonies, among, users, who, preserved, their, native, vernaculars, for, their, day, to, day, interactions, creoles, meanwhile, developed, in, settlement, colonies, in, which, speakers, of, a, european, language, often, indentured, servants, whose, language, would, be, far, from, the, standard, in, the, first, place, interacted, extensively, with, non, european, slaves, absorbing, certain, words, and, features, from, the, slaves, non, european, native, languages, resulting, in, a, heavily, basilectalized, version, of, the, original, language, these, servants, and, slaves, would, come, to, use, the, creole, as, an, everyday, vernacular, rather, than, merely, in, situations, in, which, contact, with, a, speaker, of, the, superstrate, was, necessary, the, english, term, creole, comes, from, french, cr, ole, which, is, cognate, with, the, spanish, term, criollo, and, portuguese, crioulo, all, descending, from, the, verb, criar, to, breed, or, to, raise, all, coming, from, latin, creare, to, produce, create, the, specific, sense, of, the, term, was, coined, in, the, 16th, and, 17th, century, during, the, great, expansion, in, european, maritime, power, and, trade, that, led, to, the, establishment, of, european, colonies, in, other, continents, the, terms, criollo, and, crioulo, were, originally, qualifiers, used, throughout, the, spanish, and, portuguese, colonies, to, distinguish, the, members, of, an, ethnic, group, who, were, born, and, raised, locally, from, those, who, immigrated, as, adults, they, were, most, commonly, applied, to, nationals, of, the, colonial, power, e, g, to, distinguish, espa, oles, criollos, people, born, in, the, colonies, from, spanish, ancestors, from, espa, oles, peninsulares, those, born, in, the, iberian, peninsula, i, e, spain, however, in, brazil, the, term, was, also, used, to, distinguish, between, negros, crioulos, blacks, born, in, brazil, from, african, slave, ancestors, and, negros, africanos, born, in, africa, over, time, the, term, and, its, derivatives, creole, kr, ol, kreyol, krey, l, kriol, krio, etc, lost, the, generic, meaning, and, became, the, proper, name, of, many, distinct, ethnic, groups, that, developed, locally, from, immigrant, communities, originally, therefore, the, term, creole, language, meant, the, speech, of, any, of, those, creole, peoples, as, a, consequence, of, colonial, european, trade, patterns, most, of, the, known, european, based, creole, languages, arose, in, coastal, areas, in, the, equatorial, belt, around, the, world, including, the, americas, western, africa, goa, along, the, west, of, india, and, along, southeast, asia, up, to, indonesia, singapore, macau, hong, kong, the, philippines, malaysia, mauritius, r, union, seychelles, and, oceania, many, of, those, creoles, are, now, extinct, but, others, still, survive, in, the, caribbean, the, north, and, east, coasts, of, south, america, the, guyanas, western, africa, australia, see, australian, kriol, language, the, philippines, see, chavacano, island, countries, such, as, mauritius, and, seychelles, and, in, the, indian, ocean, atlantic, creole, languages, are, based, on, european, languages, with, elements, from, african, and, possibly, amerindian, languages, indian, ocean, creole, languages, are, based, on, european, languages, with, elements, from, malagasy, and, possibly, other, asian, languages, there, are, however, creoles, like, nubi, and, sango, that, are, derived, solely, from, non, european, languages, because, of, the, generally, low, status, of, the, creole, peoples, in, the, eyes, of, prior, european, colonial, powers, creole, languages, have, generally, been, regarded, as, degenerate, languages, or, at, best, as, rudimentary, dialects, of, the, politically, dominant, parent, languages, because, of, this, the, word, creole, was, generally, used, by, linguists, in, opposition, to, language, rather, than, as, a, qualifier, for, it, another, factor, that, may, have, contributed, to, the, relative, neglect, of, creole, languages, in, linguistics, is, that, they, do, not, fit, the, 19th, century, neogrammarian, tree, model, for, the, evolution, of, languages, and, its, postulated, regularity, of, sound, changes, these, critics, including, the, earliest, advocates, of, the, wave, model, johannes, schmidt, and, hugo, schuchardt, the, forerunners, of, modern, sociolinguistics, this, controversy, of, the, late, 19th, century, profoundly, shaped, modern, approaches, to, the, comparative, method, in, historical, linguistics, and, in, creolistics, because, of, social, political, and, academic, changes, brought, on, by, decolonization, in, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, creole, languages, have, experienced, revivals, in, the, past, few, decades, they, are, increasingly, being, used, in, print, and, film, and, in, many, cases, their, community, prestige, has, improved, dramatically, in, fact, some, have, been, standardized, and, are, used, in, local, schools, and, universities, around, the, world, at, the, same, time, linguists, have, begun, to, come, to, the, realization, that, creole, languages, are, in, no, way, inferior, to, other, languages, they, now, use, the, term, creole, or, creole, language, for, any, language, suspected, to, have, undergone, creolization, terms, that, now, imply, no, geographic, restrictions, nor, ethnic, prejudices, there, is, controversy, about, the, extent, to, which, creolization, influenced, the, evolution, of, african, american, vernacular, english, aave, in, the, american, education, system, as, well, as, in, the, past, the, use, of, the, word, ebonics, to, refer, to, aave, mirrors, the, historical, negative, connotation, of, the, word, creole, according, to, their, external, history, four, types, of, creoles, have, been, distinguished, plantation, creoles, fort, creoles, maroon, creoles, and, creolized, pidgins, by, the, very, nature, of, a, creole, language, the, phylogenetic, classification, of, a, particular, creole, usually, is, a, matter, of, dispute, especially, when, the, pidgin, precursor, and, its, parent, tongues, which, may, have, been, other, creoles, or, pidgins, have, disappeared, before, they, could, be, documented, phylogenetic, classification, traditionally, relies, on, inheritance, of, the, lexicon, especially, of, core, terms, and, of, the, grammar, structure, however, in, creoles, the, core, lexicon, often, has, mixed, origin, and, the, grammar, is, largely, original, for, these, reasons, the, issue, of, which, language, is, the, parent, of, a, creole, that, is, whether, a, language, should, be, classified, as, a, french, creole, portuguese, creole, or, english, creole, etc, often, has, no, definitive, answer, and, can, become, the, topic, of, long, lasting, controversies, where, social, prejudices, and, political, considerations, may, interfere, with, scientific, discussion, the, terms, substrate, and, superstrate, are, often, used, when, two, languages, interact, however, the, meaning, of, these, terms, is, reasonably, well, defined, only, in, second, language, acquisition, or, language, replacement, events, when, the, native, speakers, of, a, certain, source, language, the, substrate, are, somehow, compelled, to, abandon, it, for, another, target, language, the, superstrate, the, outcome, of, such, an, event, is, that, erstwhile, speakers, of, the, substrate, will, use, some, version, of, the, superstrate, at, least, in, more, formal, contexts, the, substrate, may, survive, as, a, second, language, for, informal, conversation, as, demonstrated, by, the, fate, of, many, replaced, european, languages, such, as, etruscan, breton, and, venetian, the, influence, of, the, substrate, on, the, official, speech, is, often, limited, to, pronunciation, and, a, modest, number, of, loanwords, the, substrate, might, even, disappear, altogether, without, leaving, any, trace, however, there, is, dispute, over, the, extent, to, which, the, terms, substrate, and, superstrate, are, applicable, to, the, genesis, or, the, description, of, creole, languages, the, language, replacement, model, may, not, be, appropriate, in, creole, formation, contexts, where, the, emerging, language, is, derived, from, multiple, languages, without, any, one, of, them, being, imposed, as, a, replacement, for, any, other, the, substratum, superstratum, distinction, becomes, awkward, when, multiple, superstrata, must, be, assumed, such, as, in, papiamento, when, the, substratum, cannot, be, identified, or, when, the, presence, or, the, survival, of, substratal, evidence, is, inferred, from, mere, typological, analogies, on, the, other, hand, the, distinction, may, be, meaningful, when, the, contributions, of, each, parent, language, to, the, resulting, creole, can, be, shown, to, be, very, unequal, in, a, scientifically, meaningful, way, in, the, literature, on, atlantic, creoles, superstrate, usually, means, european, and, substrate, non, european, or, african, since, creole, languages, rarely, attain, official, status, the, speakers, of, a, fully, formed, creole, may, eventually, feel, compelled, to, conform, their, speech, to, one, of, the, parent, languages, this, decreolization, process, typically, brings, about, a, post, creole, speech, continuum, characterized, by, large, scale, variation, and, hypercorrection, in, the, language, it, is, generally, acknowledged, that, creoles, have, a, simpler, grammar, and, more, internal, variability, than, older, more, established, languages, however, these, notions, are, occasionally, challenged, see, also, language, complexity, phylogenetic, or, typological, comparisons, of, creole, languages, have, led, to, divergent, conclusions, similarities, are, usually, higher, among, creoles, derived, from, related, languages, such, as, the, languages, of, europe, than, among, broader, groups, that, include, also, creoles, based, on, non, indo, european, languages, like, nubi, or, sango, french, based, creole, languages, in, turn, are, more, similar, to, each, other, and, to, varieties, of, french, than, to, other, european, based, creoles, it, was, observed, in, particular, that, definite, articles, are, mostly, prenominal, in, english, based, creole, languages, and, english, whereas, they, are, generally, postnominal, in, french, creoles, and, in, the, variety, of, french, that, was, exported, to, what, is, now, quebec, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, century, moreover, the, european, languages, which, gave, rise, to, the, creole, languages, of, european, colonies, all, belong, to, the, same, subgroup, of, western, indo, european, and, have, highly, convergent, grammars, to, the, point, that, whorf, joined, them, into, a, single, standard, average, european, language, group, french, and, english, are, particularly, close, since, english, through, extensive, borrowing, is, typologically, closer, to, french, than, to, other, germanic, languages, thus, the, claimed, similarities, between, creoles, may, be, mere, consequences, of, similar, parentage, rather, than, characteristic, features, of, all, creoles, there, are, a, variety, of, theories, on, the, origin, of, creole, languages, all, of, which, attempt, to, explain, the, similarities, among, them, arends, muysken, smith, 1995, outline, a, fourfold, classification, of, explanations, regarding, creole, genesis, in, addition, to, the, precise, mechanism, of, creole, genesis, a, more, general, debate, has, developed, whether, creole, languages, are, characterized, by, different, mechanisms, than, traditional, languages, which, is, mcwhorter, s, 2018, main, point, or, whether, in, that, regard, creole, languages, develop, by, the, same, mechanisms, as, any, other, languages, e, g, degraff, 2001, the, monogenetic, theory, of, pidgins, and, creoles, hypothesizes, that, all, atlantic, creoles, derived, from, a, single, mediterranean, lingua, franca, via, a, west, african, pidgin, portuguese, of, the, seventeenth, century, relexified, in, the, so, called, slave, factories, of, western, africa, that, were, the, source, of, the, atlantic, slave, trade, this, theory, was, originally, formulated, by, hugo, schuchardt, in, the, late, nineteenth, century, and, popularized, in, the, late, 1950s, and, early, 1960s, by, taylor, whinnom, thompson, and, stewart, however, this, hypothesis, is, now, not, widely, accepted, since, it, relies, on, all, creole, speaking, slave, populations, being, based, on, the, same, portuguese, based, creole, despite, no, to, very, little, historical, exposure, to, portuguese, for, many, of, these, populations, no, strong, direct, evidence, for, this, claim, and, with, portuguese, leaving, almost, no, trace, on, the, lexicon, of, most, of, them, with, the, similarities, in, grammar, explainable, by, analogous, processes, of, loss, of, inflection, and, grammatical, forms, not, common, to, european, and, west, african, languages, for, example, bickerton, 1977, points, out, that, relexification, postulates, too, many, improbabilities, and, that, it, is, unlikely, that, a, language, could, be, disseminated, round, the, entire, tropical, zone, to, peoples, of, widely, differing, language, background, and, still, preserve, a, virtually, complete, identity, in, its, grammatical, structure, wherever, it, took, root, despite, considerable, changes, in, its, phonology, and, virtually, complete, changes, in, its, lexicon, proposed, by, hancock, 1985, for, the, origin, of, english, based, creoles, of, the, west, indies, the, domestic, origin, hypothesis, argues, that, towards, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, english, speaking, traders, began, to, settle, in, the, gambia, and, sierra, leone, rivers, as, well, as, in, neighboring, areas, such, as, the, bullom, and, sherbro, coasts, these, settlers, intermarried, with, the, local, population, leading, to, mixed, populations, and, as, a, result, of, this, intermarriage, an, english, pidgin, was, created, this, pidgin, was, learned, by, slaves, in, slave, depots, who, later, on, took, it, to, the, west, indies, and, formed, one, component, of, the, emerging, english, creoles, the, french, creoles, are, the, foremost, candidates, to, being, the, outcome, of, normal, linguistic, change, and, their, creoleness, to, be, sociohistoric, in, nature, and, relative, to, their, colonial, origin, within, this, theoretical, framework, a, french, creole, is, a, language, phylogenetically, based, on, french, more, specifically, on, a, 17th, century, koin, french, extant, in, paris, the, french, atlantic, harbors, and, the, nascent, french, colonies, supporters, of, this, hypothesis, suggest, that, the, non, creole, french, dialects, still, spoken, in, many, parts, of, the, americas, share, mutual, descent, from, this, single, koin, these, dialects, are, found, in, canada, mostly, in, qu, bec, and, in, acadian, communities, louisiana, saint, barth, lemy, and, as, isolates, in, other, parts, of, the, americas, approaches, under, this, hypothesis, are, compatible, with, gradualism, in, change, and, models, of, imperfect, language, transmission, in, koin, genesis, the, foreigner, talk, ft, hypothesis, argues, that, a, pidgin, or, creole, language, forms, when, native, speakers, attempt, to, simplify, their, language, in, order, to, address, speakers, who, do, not, know, their, language, at, all, because, of, the, similarities, found, in, this, type, of, speech, and, speech, directed, to, a, small, child, it, is, also, sometimes, called, baby, talk, arends, muysken, smith, 1995, suggest, that, four, different, processes, are, involved, in, creating, foreigner, talk, this, could, explain, why, creole, languages, have, much, in, common, while, avoiding, a, monogenetic, model, however, hinnenkamp, 1984, in, analyzing, german, foreigner, talk, claims, that, it, is, too, inconsistent, and, unpredictable, to, provide, any, model, for, language, learning, while, the, simplification, of, input, was, supposed, to, account, for, creoles, simple, grammar, commentators, have, raised, a, number, of, criticisms, of, this, explanation, another, problem, with, the, ft, explanation, is, its, potential, circularity, bloomfield, 1933, points, out, that, ft, is, often, based, on, the, imitation, of, the, incorrect, speech, of, the, non, natives, that, is, the, pidgin, therefore, one, may, be, mistaken, in, assuming, that, the, former, gave, rise, to, the, latter, the, imperfect, l2, second, language, learning, hypothesis, claims, that, pidgins, are, primarily, the, result, of, the, imperfect, l2, learning, of, the, dominant, lexifier, language, by, the, slaves, research, on, naturalistic, l2, processes, has, revealed, a, number, of, features, of, interlanguage, systems, that, are, also, seen, in, pidgins, and, creoles, imperfect, l2, learning, is, compatible, with, other, approaches, notably, the, european, dialect, origin, hypothesis, and, the, universalist, models, of, language, transmission, theories, focusing, on, the, substrate, or, non, european, languages, attribute, similarities, amongst, creoles, to, the, similarities, of, african, substrate, languages, these, features, are, often, assumed, to, be, transferred, from, the, substrate, language, to, the, creole, or, to, be, preserved, invariant, from, the, substrate, language, in, the, creole, through, a, process, of, relexification, the, substrate, language, replaces, the, native, lexical, items, with, lexical, material, from, the, superstrate, language, while, retaining, the, native, grammatical, categories, the, problem, with, this, explanation, is, that, the, postulated, substrate, languages, differ, amongst, themselves, and, with, creoles, in, meaningful, ways, bickerton, 1981, argues, that, the, number, and, diversity, of, african, languages, and, the, paucity, of, a, historical, record, on, creole, genesis, makes, determining, lexical, correspondences, a, matter, of, chance, dillard, 1970, coined, the, term, cafeteria, principle, to, refer, to, the, practice, of, arbitrarily, attributing, features, of, creoles, to, the, influence, of, substrate, african, languages, or, assorted, substandard, dialects, of, european, languages, for, a, representative, debate, on, this, issue, see, the, contributions, to, mufwene, 1993, for, a, more, recent, view, parkvall, 2000, because, of, the, sociohistoric, similarities, amongst, many, but, by, no, means, all, of, the, creoles, the, atlantic, slave, trade, and, the, plantation, system, of, the, european, colonies, have, been, emphasized, as, factors, by, linguists, such, as, mcwhorter, 1999, one, class, of, creoles, might, start, as, pidgins, rudimentary, second, languages, improvised, for, use, between, speakers, of, two, or, more, non, intelligible, native, languages, keith, whinnom, in, hymes, 1971, suggests, that, pidgins, need, three, languages, to, form, with, one, the, superstrate, being, clearly, dominant, over, the, others, the, lexicon, of, a, pidgin, is, usually, small, and, drawn, from, the, vocabularies, of, its, speakers, in, varying, proportions, morphological, details, like, word, inflections, which, usually, take, years, to, learn, are, omitted, the, syntax, is, kept, very, simple, usually, based, on, strict, word, order, in, this, initial, stage, all, aspects, of, the, speech, syntax, lexicon, and, pronunciation, tend, to, be, quite, variable, especially, with, regard, to, the, speaker, s, background, if, a, pidgin, manages, to, be, learned, by, the, children, of, a, community, as, a, native, language, it, may, become, fixed, and, acquire, a, more, complex, grammar, with, fixed, phonology, syntax, morphology, and, syntactic, embedding, pidgins, can, become, full, languages, in, only, a, single, generation, creolization, is, this, second, stage, where, the, pidgin, language, develops, into, a, fully, developed, native, language, the, vocabulary, too, will, develop, to, contain, more, and, more, items, according, to, a, rationale, of, lexical, enrichment, universalist, models, stress, the, intervention, of, specific, general, processes, during, the, transmission, of, language, from, generation, to, generation, and, from, speaker, to, speaker, the, process, invoked, varies, a, general, tendency, towards, semantic, transparency, first, language, learning, driven, by, universal, process, or, a, general, process, of, discourse, organization, bickerton, s, language, bioprogram, theory, proposed, in, the, 1980s, remains, the, main, universalist, theory, bickerton, claims, that, creoles, are, inventions, of, the, children, growing, up, on, newly, founded, plantations, around, them, they, only, heard, pidgins, spoken, without, enough, structure, to, function, as, natural, languages, and, the, children, used, their, own, innate, linguistic, capacities, to, transform, the, pidgin, input, into, a, full, fledged, language, the, alleged, common, features, of, all, creoles, would, then, stem, from, those, innate, abilities, being, universal, the, last, decades, have, seen, the, emergence, of, some, new, questions, about, the, nature, of, creoles, in, particular, the, question, of, how, complex, creoles, are, and, the, question, of, whether, creoles, are, indeed, exceptional, languages, some, features, that, distinguish, creole, languages, from, noncreoles, have, been, proposed, by, bickerton, for, example, john, mcwhorter, has, proposed, the, following, list, of, features, as, defining, the, creole, prototype, that, is, any, language, born, recently, of, a, pidgin, mcwhorter, argues, that, the, absence, of, these, three, features, is, predictable, in, languages, that, were, born, recently, of, a, pidgin, since, learning, them, would, constitute, a, distinct, challenge, to, the, non, native, speaker, over, the, course, of, generations, however, such, features, would, be, expected, to, gradually, re, appear, and, therefore, many, creoles, would, harbor, departures, from, the, prototype, identifiable, as, having, happened, after, the, creole, was, born, mcwhorter, 2018, as, one, example, mcwhorter, 2013, notes, that, the, creole, sranan, which, has, existed, for, centuries, in, a, diglossic, relationship, with, dutch, has, borrowed, some, dutch, verbs, containing, the, ver, prefix, fer, in, sranan, and, whose, meaning, is, not, analyzable, for, instance, the, pair, morsu, to, soil, fermorsu, to, squander, mcwhorter, claims, that, these, three, properties, characterize, any, language, that, was, born, recently, as, a, pidgin, and, states, at, this, writing, in, twenty, years, i, have, encountered, not, a, single, counterexample, mcwhorter, 2018, nevertheless, the, existence, of, a, creole, prototype, has, been, disputed, by, others, building, up, on, this, discussion, mcwhorter, proposed, that, the, world, s, simplest, grammars, are, creole, grammars, claiming, that, every, noncreole, language, s, grammar, is, at, least, as, complex, as, any, creole, language, s, grammar, gil, has, replied, that, riau, indonesian, has, a, simpler, grammar, than, saramaccan, the, language, mcwhorter, uses, as, a, showcase, for, his, theory, the, same, objections, were, raised, by, wittmann, in, his, 1999, debate, with, mcwhorter, the, lack, of, progress, made, in, defining, creoles, in, terms, of, their, morphology, and, syntax, has, led, scholars, such, as, robert, chaudenson, salikoko, mufwene, michel, degraff, and, henri, wittmann, to, question, the, value, of, creole, as, a, typological, class, they, argue, that, creoles, are, structurally, no, different, from, any, other, language, and, that, creole, is, a, sociohistoric, concept, not, a, linguistic, one, encompassing, displaced, populations, and, slavery, thomason, kaufman, 1988, spell, out, the, idea, of, creole, exceptionalism, claiming, that, creole, languages, are, an, instance, of, nongenetic, language, change, due, to, language, shift, with, abnormal, transmission, gradualists, question, the, abnormal, transmission, of, languages, in, a, creole, setting, and, argue, that, the, processes, which, created, today, s, creole, languages, are, no, different, from, universal, patterns, of, language, change, given, these, objections, to, creole, as, a, concept, degraff, and, others, question, the, idea, that, creoles, are, exceptional, in, any, meaningful, way, additionally, mufwene, 2002, argues, that, some, romance, languages, are, potential, creoles, but, that, they, are, not, considered, as, such, by, linguists, because, of, a, historical, bias, against, such, a, view, creolistics, investigates, the, relative, creoleness, of, languages, suspected, to, be, creoles, what, schneider, 1990, calls, the, cline, of, creoleness, no, consensus, exists, among, creolists, as, to, whether, the, nature, of, creoleness, is, prototypical, or, merely, evidence, indicative, of, a, set, of, recognizable, phenomena, seen, in, association, with, little, inherent, unity, and, no, underlying, single, cause, creoleness, is, at, the, heart, of, the, controversy, with, john, mcwhorter, and, mikael, parkvall, opposing, henri, wittmann, 1999, and, michel, degraff, in, mcwhorter, s, definition, creoleness, is, a, matter, of, degree, in, that, prototypical, creoles, exhibit, all, of, the, three, traits, he, proposes, to, diagnose, creoleness, little, or, no, inflection, little, or, no, tone, and, transparent, derivation, in, mcwhorter, s, view, less, prototypical, creoles, depart, somewhat, from, this, prototype, along, these, lines, mcwhorter, defines, haitian, creole, exhibiting, all, three, traits, as, the, most, creole, of, creoles, a, creole, like, palenquero, on, the, other, hand, would, be, less, prototypical, given, the, presence, of, inflection, to, mark, plural, past, gerund, and, participle, forms, objections, to, the, mcwhorter, parkvall, hypotheses, point, out, that, these, typological, parameters, of, creoleness, can, be, found, in, languages, such, as, manding, sooninke, and, magoua, french, which, are, not, considered, creoles, wittmann, and, degraff, come, to, the, conclusion, that, efforts, to, conceive, a, yardstick, for, measuring, creoleness, in, any, scientifically, meaningful, way, have, failed, so, far, gil, 2001, comes, to, the, same, conclusion, for, riau, indonesian, muysken, law, 2001, have, adduced, evidence, as, to, creole, languages, which, respond, unexpectedly, to, one, of, mcwhorter, s, three, features, for, example, inflectional, morphology, in, berbice, creole, dutch, tone, in, papiamentu, mufwene, 2000, and, wittmann, 2001, have, argued, further, that, creole, languages, are, structurally, no, different, from, any, other, language, and, that, creole, is, in, fact, a, sociohistoric, concept, and, not, a, linguistic, one, encompassing, displaced, population, and, slavery, degraff, walicek, 2005, discuss, creolistics, in, relation, to, colonialist, ideologies, rejecting, the, notion, that, creoles, can, be, responsibly, defined, in, terms, of, specific, grammatical, characteristics, they, discuss, the, history, of, linguistics, and, nineteenth, century, work, that, argues, for, the, consideration, of, the, sociohistorical, contexts, in, which, creole, languages, emerged, on, the, other, hand, mcwhorter, points, out, that, in, languages, such, as, bambara, essentially, a, dialect, of, manding, there, is, ample, non, transparent, derivation, and, that, there, is, no, reason, to, suppose, that, this, would, be, absent, in, close, relatives, such, as, mandinka, itself, moreover, he, also, observes, that, soninke, has, what, all, linguists, would, analyze, as, inflections, and, that, current, lexicography, of, soninke, is, too, elementary, for, it, to, be, stated, with, authority, that, it, does, not, have, non, transparent, derivation, meanwhile, magoua, french, as, described, by, henri, wittmann, retains, some, indication, of, grammatical, gender, which, qualifies, as, inflection, and, it, also, retains, non, transparent, derivation, michel, degraff, s, argument, has, been, that, haitian, creole, retains, non, transparent, derivation, from, french, ansaldo, matthews, lim, 2007, critically, assesses, the, proposal, that, creole, languages, exist, as, a, homogeneous, structural, type, with, shared, and, or, peculiar, origins, arends, muysken, smith, 1995, groups, creole, genesis, theories, into, four, categories, the, authors, also, confine, pidgins, and, mixed, languages, into, separate, chapters, outside, this, scheme, whether, or, not, relexification, come, into, the, picture
