homelessness, also, known, as, houselessness, or, being, unhoused, or, unsheltered, is, the, condition, of, lacking, stable, safe, and, functional, housing, the, general, category, includes, disparate, situations, such, as, living, on, the, streets, moving, between, temporary, accommodation, such, as, family, or, friends, living, in, boarding, houses, with, no, security, of, tenure, and, people, who, leave, their, domiciles, because, of, civil, conflict, and, are, refugees, within, their, country, the, legal, status, of, homeless, people, varies, from, place, to, place, united, states, government, homeless, enumeration, studies, also, include, people, who, sleep, in, a, public, or, private, place, which, is, not, designed, for, use, as, a, regular, sleeping, accommodation, for, human, beings, homelessness, and, poverty, are, interrelated, there, is, no, standardized, method, for, counting, homeless, individuals, and, identifying, their, needs, consequently, most, cities, only, have, estimated, figures, for, their, homeless, populations, in, 2024, an, estimated, 140, 150, million, people, worldwide, were, homeless, and, as, many, as, 1, 6, billion, people, live, as, squatters, refugees, or, in, temporary, shelters, unhoused, persons, who, travel, have, been, termed, vagrants, in, the, past, of, those, persons, looking, for, work, are, hobos, whereas, those, who, do, not, are, tramps, all, three, of, these, terms, however, generally, have, a, derogatory, connotation, today, in, 2004, the, united, nations, sector, of, economic, and, social, affairs, defined, a, homeless, household, as, those, households, without, a, shelter, that, would, fall, within, the, scope, of, living, quarters, due, to, a, lack, of, a, steady, income, the, affected, people, carry, their, few, possessions, with, them, sleeping, in, the, streets, in, doorways, or, on, piers, or, in, another, space, on, a, more, or, less, random, basis, in, 2009, at, the, united, nations, economic, commission, for, europe, conference, of, european, statisticians, ces, the, group, of, experts, on, population, and, housing, censuses, defined, homelessness, as, in, its, recommendations, for, the, censuses, of, population, and, housing, the, ces, identifies, homeless, people, under, two, broad, groups, article, 25, of, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, adopted, 10, december, 1948, by, the, un, general, assembly, contains, this, text, regarding, housing, and, quality, of, living, everyone, has, the, right, to, a, standard, of, living, adequate, for, the, health, and, well, being, of, himself, and, of, his, family, including, food, clothing, housing, and, medical, care, and, necessary, social, services, and, the, right, to, security, in, the, event, of, unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old, age, or, other, lack, of, livelihood, in, circumstances, beyond, his, control, the, ethos, typology, of, homelessness, and, housing, exclusion, was, developed, as, a, means, of, improving, the, understanding, and, measurement, of, homelessness, in, europe, and, to, provide, a, common, language, for, transnational, exchanges, on, homelessness, the, ethos, approach, says, homelessness, is, a, process, rather, than, a, static, phenomenon, that, affects, many, vulnerable, households, at, different, points, in, their, lives, the, typology, was, launched, in, 2005, and, is, used, for, different, purposes, as, a, framework, for, debate, for, data, collection, purposes, policy, purposes, monitoring, purposes, and, in, the, media, this, typology, is, an, open, exercise, that, makes, abstraction, of, existing, legal, definitions, in, the, eu, member, states, it, exists, in, 25, language, versions, the, translations, being, provided, mainly, by, volunteer, translators, many, countries, and, individuals, do, not, consider, housing, as, a, human, right, former, u, s, president, jimmy, carter, addressed, this, issue, in, a, 2017, interview, saying, a, lot, of, people, don, t, look, at, housing, as, a, human, right, but, it, is, his, view, contrasts, with, many, americans, who, do, not, believe, housing, is, a, basic, human, right, many, homeless, enumeration, studies, published, in, the, 2010s, and, onward, utilize, the, term, unsheltered, homeless, the, common, colloquial, term, street, people, does, not, fully, encompass, all, unsheltered, people, in, that, many, such, persons, do, not, spend, their, time, in, urban, street, environments, many, shun, such, locales, because, homeless, people, in, urban, environments, may, face, the, risk, of, being, robbed, or, assaulted, some, people, convert, unoccupied, or, abandoned, buildings, squatting, or, inhabit, mountainous, areas, or, more, often, lowland, meadows, creek, banks, and, beaches, many, jurisdictions, have, developed, programs, to, provide, short, term, emergency, shelter, during, particularly, cold, spells, often, in, churches, or, other, institutional, properties, these, are, referred, to, as, warming, centers, and, are, credited, by, their, advocates, as, lifesaving, other, common, terms, include, urban, campers, unsheltered, unhomed, and, houseless, in, 2020, an, entry, on, homelessness, was, added, to, the, associated, press, stylebook, noting, how, homeless, is, generally, acceptable, as, an, adjective, to, describe, people, without, a, fixed, residence, and, that, reporters, should, use, person, first, language, to, avoid, the, dehumanizing, collective, noun, the, homeless, instead, using, constructions, like, homeless, people, people, without, housing, or, people, without, homes, following, the, peasants, revolt, english, constables, were, authorized, under, 1383, english, poor, laws, to, collar, vagabonds, and, force, them, to, show, support, if, they, could, not, the, penalty, was, gaol, vagabonds, could, be, sentenced, to, the, stocks, for, three, days, and, nights, in, 1530, whipping, was, added, the, presumption, was, that, vagabonds, were, unlicensed, beggars, in, 1547, a, bill, was, passed, that, subjected, vagrants, to, more, provisions, of, the, criminal, law, namely, two, years, servitude, and, branding, with, a, v, as, the, penalty, for, the, first, offense, and, death, for, the, second, many, vagabonds, were, among, the, convicts, transported, to, the, american, colonies, in, the, 18th, century, during, the, 16th, century, in, england, the, state, first, tried, to, give, housing, to, vagrants, instead, of, punishing, them, by, introducing, bridewells, to, take, vagrants, and, train, them, for, a, profession, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, these, were, replaced, by, workhouses, but, these, were, intended, to, discourage, too, much, reliance, on, state, help, in, the, antebellum, south, the, availability, of, enslaved, labor, made, it, difficult, for, poor, white, people, to, find, work, to, prevent, them, from, cooperating, with, enslaved, black, people, slaveowners, policed, poor, whites, with, vagrancy, laws, after, the, american, civil, war, a, large, number, by, the, hundreds, or, thousands, of, homeless, men, formed, part, of, a, counterculture, known, as, hobohemia, all, over, the, united, states, in, smaller, towns, hobos, temporarily, lived, near, train, tracks, and, hopped, onto, trains, to, various, destinations, the, growing, movement, toward, social, concern, sparked, the, development, of, rescue, missions, such, as, the, u, s, first, rescue, mission, the, new, york, city, rescue, mission, founded, in, 1872, by, jerry, and, maria, mcauley, the, u, s, great, depression, of, the, 1930s, caused, an, epidemic, of, poverty, hunger, and, homelessness, in, the, united, states, when, franklin, d, roosevelt, took, over, the, presidency, from, herbert, hoover, in, 1933, he, signed, the, new, deal, which, expanded, social, welfare, including, providing, funds, to, build, public, housing, how, the, other, half, lives, and, jack, london, s, the, people, of, the, abyss, 1903, discussed, homelessness, and, raised, public, awareness, which, caused, some, changes, in, building, codes, and, some, social, conditions, in, england, dormitory, housing, called, spikes, was, provided, by, local, boroughs, by, the, 1930s, in, england, 30, 000, people, were, living, in, these, facilities, in, 1933, george, orwell, wrote, about, poverty, in, london, and, paris, in, his, book, down, and, out, in, paris, and, london, in, general, in, most, countries, many, towns, and, cities, had, an, area, that, contained, the, poor, transients, and, afflicted, such, as, a, skid, row, in, new, york, city, for, example, there, was, the, bowery, traditionally, where, people, with, an, alcohol, use, disorder, were, to, be, found, sleeping, on, the, streets, bottle, in, hand, in, the, 1960s, in, the, u, k, the, nature, and, growing, problem, of, homelessness, changed, in, england, as, public, concern, grew, the, number, of, people, living, rough, in, the, streets, had, increased, dramatically, however, beginning, with, the, conservative, administration, s, rough, sleeper, initiative, the, number, of, people, sleeping, rough, in, london, fell, dramatically, this, initiative, was, supported, further, by, the, incoming, labour, administration, from, 2009, onwards, with, the, publication, of, the, coming, in, from, the, cold, strategy, published, by, the, rough, sleepers, unit, which, proposed, and, delivered, a, massive, increase, in, the, number, of, hostel, bed, spaces, in, the, capital, and, an, increase, in, funding, for, street, outreach, teams, who, work, with, rough, sleepers, to, enable, them, to, access, services, scotland, saw, a, slightly, different, picture, with, the, impact, of, the, right, to, buy, ending, in, a, significant, drop, in, available, social, housing, the, 1980s, and, the, 1990s, resulted, in, an, ever, increasing, picture, of, people, becoming, homeless, in, 2001, the, scottish, parliament, came, into, place, it, was, agreed, by, all, parties, that, a, ten, year, plan, to, eradicate, homelessness, by, the, end, of, 2012, would, be, implemented, the, minister, of, housing, met, with, the, third, sector, and, local, authorities, every, six, weeks, checking, on, progress, whilst, consultations, brought, about, legislative, change, alongside, work, to, prevent, homelessness, there, was, a, peak, in, applications, around, 2005, but, from, there, onwards, figures, dropped, year, on, year, for, the, next, eight, years, however, with, a, focus, on, the, broader, numbers, of, people, experiencing, homelessness, many, people, with, higher, levels, of, need, got, caught, in, the, system, work, from, 2017, started, to, address, this, with, a, framework, put, in, place, to, work, towards, a, day, where, everyone, in, scotland, has, a, home, suitable, to, meet, their, needs, in, 2002, research, showed, that, children, and, families, were, the, largest, growing, segment, of, the, homeless, population, in, the, united, states, and, this, has, presented, new, challenges, to, agencies, in, the, u, s, the, government, asked, many, major, cities, to, come, up, with, a, ten, year, plan, to, end, homelessness, one, of, the, results, of, this, was, a, housing, first, solution, the, housing, first, program, offers, homeless, people, access, to, housing, without, having, to, undergo, tests, for, sobriety, and, drug, usage, the, housing, first, program, seems, to, benefit, homeless, people, in, every, aspect, except, for, substance, abuse, for, which, the, program, offers, little, accountability, an, emerging, consensus, is, that, the, housing, first, program, still, gives, clients, a, higher, chance, at, retaining, their, housing, once, they, get, it, a, few, critical, voices, argue, that, it, misuses, resources, and, does, more, harm, than, good, they, suggest, that, it, encourages, rent, seeking, and, that, there, is, not, yet, enough, evidence, based, research, on, the, effects, of, this, program, on, the, homeless, population, some, formerly, homeless, people, who, were, finally, able, to, obtain, housing, and, other, assets, which, helped, to, return, to, a, normal, lifestyle, have, donated, money, and, volunteer, services, to, the, organizations, that, provided, aid, to, them, during, their, homelessness, alternatively, some, social, service, entities, that, help, homeless, people, now, employ, formerly, homeless, individuals, to, assist, in, the, care, process, homelessness, has, migrated, toward, rural, and, suburban, areas, although, the, number, of, homeless, people, has, not, changed, dramatically, the, number, of, homeless, families, has, increased, according, to, a, report, by, hud, the, united, states, congress, appropriated, 25, million, in, the, mckinney, vento, homeless, assistance, grants, for, 2008, to, show, the, effectiveness, of, rapid, re, housing, programs, in, reducing, family, homelessness, in, february, 2009, president, obama, signed, the, american, recovery, and, reinvestment, act, of, 2009, part, of, which, addressed, homelessness, prevention, allocating, 1, 5, billion, for, a, homeless, prevention, fund, the, emergency, shelter, grant, esg, program, s, name, was, changed, to, emergency, solution, grant, esg, program, and, funds, were, reallocated, to, assist, with, homeless, prevention, and, rapid, re, housing, for, families, and, individuals, in, january, 2024, the, united, states, supreme, court, agreed, to, make, a, decision, on, whether, city, laws, that, punish, individuals, to, limit, the, growth, of, homeless, encampments, are, in, violation, of, the, constitution, s, limits, for, cruel, and, unusual, punishment, in, june, 2024, the, u, s, supreme, court, in, a, 6, 3, ruling, permitted, u, s, cities, to, criminalize, homeless, camps, thus, making, it, possible, to, jail, people, for, sleeping, in, areas, such, as, public, parks, major, reasons, for, homelessness, include, gentrification, is, a, process, in, which, a, formerly, affordable, neighborhood, becomes, popular, with, wealthier, people, raising, housing, prices, and, pushing, poorer, residents, out, gentrification, can, cause, or, influence, evictions, foreclosures, and, rent, regulation, increased, wealth, disparity, and, income, inequality, cause, distortions, in, the, housing, market, that, push, rent, burdens, higher, making, housing, unaffordable, in, many, countries, people, lose, their, homes, by, government, orders, to, make, way, for, newer, upscale, high, rise, buildings, roadways, and, other, governmental, needs, the, compensation, may, be, minimal, in, which, case, the, former, occupants, cannot, find, appropriate, new, housing, and, become, homeless, mortgage, foreclosures, where, mortgage, holders, see, the, best, solution, to, a, loan, default, is, to, take, and, sell, the, house, to, pay, off, the, debt, can, leave, people, homeless, foreclosures, on, landlords, often, lead, to, the, eviction, of, their, tenants, the, sarasota, florida, herald, tribune, noted, that, by, some, estimates, more, than, 311, 000, tenants, nationwide, have, been, evicted, from, homes, this, year, after, lenders, took, over, the, properties, rent, regulation, also, has, a, small, effect, on, shelter, and, street, populations, this, is, largely, due, to, rent, control, reducing, the, quality, and, quantity, of, housing, for, example, a, 2019, study, found, that, san, francisco, s, rent, control, laws, reduced, tenant, displacement, from, rent, controlled, units, in, the, short, term, but, resulted, in, landlords, removing, thirty, percent, of, the, rent, controlled, units, from, the, rental, market, by, conversion, to, condos, or, tics, which, led, to, a, fifteen, percent, citywide, decrease, in, total, rental, units, and, a, seven, percent, increase, in, citywide, rents, lack, of, jobs, that, pay, living, wages, lack, of, affordable, housing, and, lack, of, health, and, social, services, can, lead, to, poverty, and, homelessness, factors, that, can, lead, to, economic, struggle, include, neighborhood, gentrification, as, previously, discussed, job, loss, debt, loss, of, money, or, assets, due, to, divorce, death, of, breadwinning, spouse, being, denied, jobs, due, to, discrimination, and, many, others, moreover, the, absence, of, accessible, health, and, social, services, further, compounds, the, economic, struggle, for, many, inadequate, healthcare, can, lead, to, untreated, illnesses, making, it, difficult, for, individuals, to, maintain, employment, perpetuating, a, cycle, of, poverty, social, services, including, mental, health, support, and, addiction, treatment, are, essential, for, addressing, the, root, causes, of, economic, hardship, however, limited, access, to, these, services, leaves, vulnerable, populations, without, the, necessary, support, systems, hindering, their, ability, to, escape, poverty, poverty, is, a, significant, factor, in, homelessness, alleviation, of, poverty, as, a, result, plays, an, essential, role, in, eliminating, homelessness, some, non, governmental, organizations, ngos, have, studied, unconditional, cash, transfers, ucts, to, low, income, families, and, individuals, to, reduce, poverty, in, developing, countries, despite, their, initial, concern, about, uct, s, potentially, negative, effects, on, the, recipients, the, researchers, found, promising, results, the, study, in, kenya, found, that, assisted, households, increased, their, consumption, and, savings, while, the, families, spent, more, on, their, food, and, food, security, they, did, not, incur, any, expenses, on, unnecessary, goods, or, services, this, study, shows, that, a, proper, approach, to, poverty, could, effectively, eliminate, this, factor, as, part, of, a, solution, to, homelessness, providing, access, to, education, and, employment, to, low, income, families, and, individuals, must, also, be, considered, to, combat, poverty, and, prevent, homelessness, homelessness, is, closely, connected, to, declines, in, physical, and, mental, health, most, people, who, use, homeless, shelters, frequently, face, multiple, disadvantages, such, as, the, increased, prevalence, of, physical, and, mental, health, problems, disabilities, addiction, poverty, and, discrimination, studies, show, that, preventive, and, primary, care, which, homeless, people, are, not, receiving, substantially, lower, overall, healthcare, costs, in, terms, of, providing, adequate, treatment, to, homeless, people, for, their, mental, illness, the, healthcare, system, s, performance, has, not, been, promising, either, disabilities, especially, where, disability, services, are, non, existent, inconvenient, or, poorly, performing, can, impact, a, person, s, ability, to, support, house, payments, mortgages, or, rent, especially, if, they, are, unable, to, work, traumatic, brain, injury, is, one, main, disability, that, can, account, for, homelessness, according, to, a, canadian, survey, traumatic, brain, injury, is, widespread, among, homeless, people, and, for, around, 70, percent, of, respondents, can, be, attributed, to, a, time, before, the, onset, of, homelessness, lack, of, housing, serves, as, a, social, determinant, of, mental, health, being, afflicted, with, a, mental, disorder, including, substance, use, disorders, where, mental, health, services, are, unavailable, or, difficult, to, access, can, also, drive, homelessness, for, the, same, reasons, as, disabilities, a, united, states, federal, survey, in, 2005, indicated, that, at, least, one, third, of, homeless, men, and, women, had, serious, psychiatric, disorders, or, problems, autism, spectrum, disorders, and, schizophrenia, are, the, top, two, common, mental, disabilities, among, the, u, s, homeless, personality, disorders, are, also, very, prevalent, especially, cluster, a, a, history, of, experiencing, domestic, violence, can, also, attribute, to, homelessness, compared, to, housed, women, homeless, women, were, more, likely, to, report, childhood, histories, of, abuse, as, well, as, more, current, physical, abuse, by, male, partners, gender, disparities, also, influence, the, demographics, of, homelessness, the, experiences, of, homeless, women, and, women, in, poverty, are, often, overlooked, however, they, experience, specific, gender, based, victimization, as, individuals, with, little, to, no, physical, or, material, capital, homeless, women, are, particularly, targeted, by, male, law, enforcement, and, men, living, on, the, street, it, has, been, found, that, street, based, homelessness, dominates, mainstream, understanding, of, homelessness, and, it, is, indeed, an, environment, in, which, males, have, far, greater, power, o, grady, and, gaietz, 2004, women, on, the, street, are, often, motivated, to, gain, capital, through, affiliation, and, relationships, with, men, rather, than, facing, homelessness, alone, within, these, relationships, women, are, still, likely, to, be, physically, and, sexually, abused, social, exclusion, related, to, sexual, orientation, gender, identity, or, expression, or, sex, characteristics, can, also, attribute, to, homelessness, based, on, discrimination, relationship, breakdown, particularly, with, young, people, and, their, parents, such, as, disownment, due, to, sexuality, or, gender, identity, is, one, example, natural, disasters, including, but, not, limited, to, earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, tornadoes, and, volcanic, eruptions, can, cause, homelessness, an, example, is, the, 1999, athens, earthquake, in, greece, in, which, many, middle, class, people, became, homeless, with, some, of, them, living, in, containers, especially, in, the, nea, ionia, earthquake, survivors, container, city, provided, by, the, government, in, most, cases, their, only, property, that, survived, the, quake, was, their, car, such, people, are, known, in, greece, as, seismopathis, meaning, earthquake, struck, war, and, conflict, are, major, drivers, of, homelessness, displacing, millions, of, people, globally, the, united, nations, high, commissioner, for, refugees, unhcr, estimates, that, nearly, 60, million, people, are, displaced, due, to, war, persecution, and, other, factors, for, example, the, syrian, civil, war, has, resulted, in, over, 6, 6, million, internally, displaced, persons, and, 5, 6, million, refugees, the, ongoing, conflict, in, ukraine, has, also, had, a, devastating, impact, with, more, than, 1, 4, million, housing, units, damaged, or, destroyed, leaving, millions, in, need, of, housing, support, as, of, early, 2024, there, are, nearly, 3, 7, million, internally, displaced, people, in, ukraine, these, individuals, often, face, dire, living, conditions, with, limited, access, to, basic, necessities, such, as, shelter, food, and, healthcare, the, long, term, effects, of, war, induced, homelessness, include, disrupted, education, loss, of, livelihoods, and, severe, psychological, trauma, further, complicating, efforts, to, achieve, stability, and, recovery, transitions, from, foster, care, and, other, public, systems, can, also, impact, homelessness, specifically, youth, who, have, been, involved, in, or, are, a, part, of, the, foster, care, system, are, more, likely, to, become, homeless, most, leaving, the, system, have, no, support, and, no, income, making, it, nearly, impossible, to, break, the, cycle, and, forcing, them, to, live, on, the, streets, there, is, also, a, lack, of, shelter, beds, for, youth, various, shelters, have, stringent, admissions, policies, although, incredibly, uncommon, there, do, exist, some, who, choose, to, be, homeless, as, a, personal, choice, the, basic, problem, of, homelessness, is, the, need, for, personal, shelter, warmth, and, safety, other, difficulties, include, people, experiencing, homelessness, face, many, problems, beyond, the, lack, of, a, safe, and, suitable, home, they, are, often, faced, with, reduced, access, to, private, and, public, services, and, vital, necessities, there, is, sometimes, corruption, and, theft, by, the, employees, of, a, shelter, as, evidenced, by, a, 2011, investigative, report, by, fox, 25, tv, in, boston, wherein, several, boston, public, shelter, employees, were, found, stealing, large, amounts, of, from, the, shelter, s, kitchen, for, their, private, use, and, catering, over, time, homeless, people, are, often, obliged, to, adopt, various, strategies, of, self, presentation, to, maintain, a, sense, of, dignity, which, constrains, their, interaction, with, passers, by, and, leads, to, suspicion, and, stigmatization, by, the, mainstream, public, homelessness, is, also, a, risk, factor, for, depression, caused, by, prejudice, when, someone, is, prejudiced, against, people, who, are, homeless, and, then, becomes, homeless, themselves, their, anti, homelessness, prejudice, turns, inward, causing, depression, mental, disorders, physical, disability, homelessness, and, having, a, sexually, transmitted, infection, are, all, stigmatized, statuses, someone, can, gain, despite, having, negative, stereotypes, about, those, groups, difficulties, can, compound, exponentially, a, study, found, that, in, the, city, of, hong, kong, over, half, of, the, homeless, people, in, the, city, 56, had, some, degree, of, mental, illness, only, 13, percent, of, the, 56, percent, were, receiving, treatment, for, their, condition, leaving, a, huge, portion, of, homeless, untreated, for, their, mental, illness, the, issue, of, anti, homeless, architecture, came, to, light, in, 2014, after, a, photo, displayed, hostile, features, spikes, on, the, floor, in, london, and, took, social, media, by, storm, the, photo, of, an, anti, homeless, structure, was, a, classic, example, of, hostile, architecture, in, an, attempt, to, discourage, people, from, attempting, to, access, or, use, public, space, in, irregular, ways, however, although, this, has, only, recently, came, to, light, hostile, architecture, has, been, around, for, a, long, time, in, many, places, 68, an, example, of, this, is, a, low, overpass, that, was, put, in, place, between, new, york, city, and, long, island, robert, moses, an, urban, planner, designed, it, this, way, in, an, attempt, to, prevent, public, buses, from, being, able, to, pass, through, it, health, care, for, homeless, people, is, a, major, public, health, challenge, when, compared, to, the, general, population, people, who, are, homeless, experience, higher, rates, of, adverse, physical, and, mental, health, outcomes, chronic, disease, severity, respiratory, conditions, rates, of, mental, health, illnesses, and, substance, use, are, all, often, greater, in, homeless, populations, than, in, the, general, population, homelessness, is, also, associated, with, a, high, risk, of, suicide, attempts, homeless, people, are, more, likely, to, suffer, injuries, and, medical, problems, from, their, lifestyle, on, the, street, which, includes, poor, nutrition, exposure, to, the, severe, elements, of, weather, and, higher, exposure, to, violence, yet, at, the, same, time, they, have, reduced, access, to, public, medical, services, or, clinics, in, part, because, they, often, lack, identification, or, registration, for, public, healthcare, services, there, are, significant, challenges, in, treating, homeless, people, who, have, psychiatric, disorders, because, clinical, appointments, may, not, be, kept, their, continuing, whereabouts, are, unknown, their, medicines, may, not, be, taken, as, prescribed, medical, and, psychiatric, histories, are, not, accurate, and, other, reasons, because, many, homeless, people, have, mental, illnesses, this, has, presented, a, care, crisis, the, conditions, affecting, homeless, people, are, somewhat, specialized, and, have, opened, a, new, area, of, medicine, tailored, to, this, population, skin, conditions, including, scabies, are, common, because, homeless, people, are, exposed, to, extreme, cold, in, the, winter, and, have, little, access, to, bathing, facilities, they, have, problems, caring, for, their, feet, and, have, more, severe, dental, problems, than, the, general, population, diabetes, especially, untreated, is, widespread, in, the, homeless, population, specialized, medical, textbooks, have, been, written, to, address, this, for, providers, due, to, the, demand, for, free, medical, services, by, homeless, people, it, might, take, months, to, get, a, minimal, dental, appointment, in, a, free, care, clinic, communicable, diseases, are, of, great, concern, especially, tuberculosis, which, spreads, more, easily, in, crowded, homeless, shelters, in, high, density, urban, settings, there, has, been, ongoing, concern, and, studies, about, the, health, and, wellness, of, the, older, homeless, population, typically, ages, 50, to, 64, and, older, as, to, whether, they, are, significantly, more, sickly, than, their, younger, counterparts, and, if, they, are, under, served, a, 2011, study, led, by, dr, rebecca, t, brown, in, boston, conducted, by, the, institute, for, aging, research, an, affiliate, of, harvard, medical, school, beth, israel, deaconess, medical, center, and, the, boston, health, care, for, the, homeless, program, found, the, elderly, homeless, population, had, higher, rates, of, geriatric, syndromes, including, functional, decline, falls, frailty, and, depression, than, seniors, in, the, general, population, and, that, many, of, these, conditions, may, be, easily, treated, if, detected, the, report, was, published, in, the, journal, of, geriatric, internal, medicine, there, are, government, avenues, which, provide, resources, for, the, development, of, healthcare, for, homeless, people, in, the, united, states, the, bureau, of, primary, health, care, has, a, program, that, provides, grants, to, fund, the, delivery, of, healthcare, to, homeless, people, according, to, 2011, uds, data, community, health, centers, were, able, to, provide, service, to, 1, 087, 431, homeless, individuals, many, nonprofit, and, religious, organizations, provide, healthcare, services, to, homeless, people, these, organizations, help, meet, the, large, need, which, exists, for, expanding, healthcare, for, homeless, people, there, have, been, significant, numbers, of, unsheltered, persons, dying, of, hypothermia, adding, impetus, to, the, trend, of, establishing, warming, centers, as, well, as, extending, enumeration, surveys, with, vulnerability, indexes, in, 1999, dr, susan, barrow, of, the, columbia, university, center, for, homelessness, prevention, studies, reported, in, a, study, that, the, age, adjusted, death, rates, of, homeless, men, and, women, were, four, times, those, of, the, general, u, s, population, and, two, to, three, times, those, of, the, general, population, of, new, york, city, a, report, commissioned, by, homeless, charity, crisis, in, 2011, found, that, on, average, homeless, people, in, the, u, k, have, a, life, expectancy, of, 47, years, 30, years, younger, than, the, rest, of, the, population, people, experiencing, homelessness, are, at, a, significantly, increased, risk, of, the, effects, of, extreme, weather, events, such, weather, events, include, extreme, heat, and, cold, floods, storm, surges, heavy, rain, and, droughts, while, there, are, many, contributing, factors, to, these, events, climate, change, is, driving, an, increasing, frequency, and, intensity, of, these, events, the, homeless, population, is, considerably, more, vulnerable, to, these, weather, events, due, to, their, higher, rates, of, chronic, disease, and, lower, socioeconomic, status, despite, having, a, minimal, carbon, footprint, homeless, people, unfortunately, experience, a, disproportionate, burden, of, the, effects, of, climate, change, homeless, persons, have, increased, vulnerability, to, extreme, weather, events, for, many, reasons, they, are, disadvantaged, in, most, social, determinants, of, health, including, lack, of, housing, and, access, to, adequate, food, and, water, reduced, access, to, health, care, and, difficulty, in, maintaining, health, care, they, have, significantly, higher, rates, of, chronic, disease, including, respiratory, disease, and, infections, gastrointestinal, disease, musculoskeletal, problems, and, mental, health, disease, in, fact, self, reported, rates, of, respiratory, diseases, including, asthma, chronic, bronchitis, and, emphysema, are, double, that, of, the, general, population, the, homeless, population, often, lives, in, higher, risk, urban, areas, with, increased, exposure, and, little, protection, from, the, elements, they, also, have, limited, access, to, clean, drinking, water, and, other, methods, of, cooling, down, the, built, environment, in, urban, areas, also, contributes, to, the, heat, island, effect, the, phenomenon, whereby, cities, experience, higher, temperatures, due, to, the, predominance, of, dark, paved, surfaces, and, lack, of, vegetation, homeless, populations, are, often, excluded, from, disaster, planning, efforts, further, increasing, their, vulnerability, when, these, events, occur, without, the, means, to, escape, extreme, temperatures, and, seek, proper, shelter, and, cooling, or, warming, resources, homeless, people, are, often, left, to, suffer, the, brunt, of, the, extreme, weather, the, health, effects, that, result, from, extreme, weather, include, exacerbation, of, chronic, diseases, and, acute, illnesses, pre, existing, conditions, can, be, greatly, exacerbated, by, extreme, heat, and, cold, including, cardiovascular, respiratory, skin, and, renal, disease, often, resulting, in, higher, morbidity, and, mortality, during, extreme, weather, acute, conditions, such, as, sunburn, dehydration, heat, stroke, and, allergic, reactions, are, also, common, in, addition, a, rise, in, insect, bites, can, lead, to, vector, borne, infections, mental, health, conditions, can, also, be, impacted, by, extreme, weather, events, as, a, result, of, lack, of, sleep, increased, alcohol, consumption, reduced, access, to, resources, and, reduced, ability, to, adjust, to, environmental, changes, pre, existing, psychiatric, illness, has, been, shown, to, triple, the, risk, of, death, from, extreme, heat, overall, extreme, weather, events, appear, to, have, a, magnifying, effect, in, exacerbating, the, underlying, prevalent, mental, and, physical, health, conditions, of, homeless, populations, in, 2005, hurricane, katrina, a, category, 5, hurricane, made, landfall, in, florida, and, louisiana, it, particularly, affected, the, city, of, new, orleans, and, the, surrounding, areas, hurricane, katrina, was, the, deadliest, hurricane, in, the, us, in, seven, decades, with, more, than, 1, 600, confirmed, deaths, and, more, than, 1, 000, people, missing, the, hurricane, disproportionately, affected, marginalized, individuals, and, individuals, with, lower, socioeconomic, status, i, e, 93, of, shelter, residents, were, african, american, 32, percent, had, household, incomes, below, 10, 000, year, and, 54, percent, were, uninsured, the, storm, nearly, doubled, the, number, of, homeless, people, in, new, orleans, while, in, most, cities, homeless, people, account, for, one, percent, of, the, population, in, new, orleans, the, homeless, account, for, four, percent, of, the, population, in, addition, to, its, devastating, effects, on, infrastructure, and, the, economy, the, estimated, prevalence, of, mental, illness, and, the, incidence, of, west, nile, virus, more, than, doubled, after, hurricane, katrina, in, the, hurricane, affected, regions, homeless, people, may, find, it, difficult, to, document, their, date, of, birth, or, their, address, because, homeless, people, usually, have, no, place, to, store, possessions, they, often, lose, their, belongings, including, identification, and, other, documents, or, find, them, destroyed, by, police, or, others, without, a, photo, id, homeless, persons, cannot, get, a, job, or, access, many, social, services, including, healthcare, they, can, be, denied, access, to, even, the, most, basic, assistance, clothing, closets, food, pantries, certain, public, benefits, and, in, some, cases, emergency, shelters, obtaining, replacement, identification, is, difficult, without, an, address, birth, certificates, cannot, be, mailed, fees, may, be, cost, prohibitive, for, impoverished, persons, and, some, states, will, not, issue, birth, certificates, unless, the, person, has, photo, identification, creating, a, catch, 22, this, problem, is, far, less, acute, in, countries, that, provide, free, at, use, health, care, such, as, the, u, k, where, hospitals, are, open, access, day, and, night, and, make, no, charges, for, treatment, in, the, u, s, free, care, clinics, for, homeless, people, and, other, people, do, exist, in, major, cities, but, often, attract, more, demand, than, they, can, meet, homeless, people, are, often, the, victims, of, violent, crime, a, 2007, study, found, that, the, rate, of, violent, crimes, against, homeless, people, in, the, united, states, is, increasing, a, study, of, women, veterans, found, that, homelessness, is, associated, with, domestic, violence, both, directly, as, the, result, of, leaving, an, abusive, partner, and, indirectly, due, to, trauma, mental, health, conditions, and, substance, abuse, a, 2024, study, published, in, the, annual, review, of, criminology, confirmed, findings, in, united, states, and, canada, over, a, 30, year, cohort, study, that, homelessness, faces, the, additional, challenge, of, separating, its, consequences, from, the, factors, that, lead, to, it, homelessness, is, related, to, many, variables, associated, with, crime, victimization, and, criminal, legal, system, contact, stigma, conditions, such, as, alcoholism, and, mental, illness, are, often, associated, with, homelessness, many, people, fear, homeless, people, due, to, the, stigma, surrounding, the, homeless, community, surveys, have, revealed, that, before, spending, time, with, homeless, people, most, people, fear, them, but, after, spending, time, with, homeless, people, that, fear, is, lessened, or, is, no, longer, there, another, effect, of, this, stigma, is, isolation, the, stigmas, of, homelessness, can, thus, be, divided, into, three, major, categories, in, general, relying, on, the, famous, contact, hypothesis, researchers, argue, that, increasing, contact, between, the, homeless, population, and, non, homeless, population, is, likely, to, change, public, opinions, on, this, out, group, and, make, the, public, more, well, informed, when, it, comes, to, policymaking, while, some, believe, that, the, contact, hypothesis, is, only, valid, on, the, condition, that, the, context, and, type, of, contact, are, specified, in, the, case, of, reducing, discrimination, against, the, homelessness, population, some, survey, data, indicate, that, the, context, e, g, the, proportion, of, the, homeless, population, in, one, s, city, and, type, of, contact, e, g, tv, shows, about, the, homeless, population, or, interpersonal, conversations, about, homelessness, do, not, produce, many, variations, as, they, all, increase, positive, attitudes, towards, homeless, people, and, public, policies, that, aid, this, group, given, that, the, restrictions, of, contexts, and, types, of, contact, to, reduce, stigma, are, minimal, this, finding, is, informative, and, significant, to, the, government, when, it, comes, to, making, policies, to, offer, institutional, support, for, reducing, discrimination, in, a, country, and, for, gauging, public, opinions, on, their, proposed, policies, to, reduce, homelessness, homelessness, in, egypt, is, a, significant, social, issue, affecting, some, 12, million, people, in, the, country, egypt, has, over, 1, 200, areas, designated, for, irregular, dwellings, that, do, not, conform, to, standard, building, laws, allowing, homeless, people, to, build, shacks, and, other, shelters, for, themselves, reportedly, in, egypt, homelessness, is, defined, to, include, those, living, in, marginal, housing, some, scholars, have, stated, that, there, is, no, agreed, upon, definition, of, homelessness, in, egypt, due, to, the, difficulties, government, would, face, if, an, official, definition, were, accepted, according, to, unicef, there, are, one, million, children, living, on, the, streets, in, egypt, other, researchers, estimate, the, number, to, be, some, three, million, homelessness, ngos, assisting, street, children, include, those, such, as, hope, village, society, and, nafas, other, ngos, such, as, plan, international, egypt, work, to, reintegrate, street, children, back, into, their, families, homelessness, in, south, africa, dates, back, to, the, apartheid, period, increasing, unemployment, lack, of, affordable, housing, social, disintegration, and, social, and, economic, policies, have, all, been, identified, as, contributing, factors, to, the, issue, some, scholars, argue, that, solutions, to, homelessness, in, south, africa, lie, more, within, the, private, sphere, than, in, the, legal, and, political, spheres, there, is, no, national, census, on, homeless, people, in, south, africa, researchers, instead, rely, on, individual, studies, of, homeless, persons, in, particular, cities, the, south, african, homeless, population, has, been, estimated, at, 200, 000, people, from, a, diverse, range, of, backgrounds, one, study, found, that, three, out, of, four, south, african, metropolitan, municipalities, viewed, homelessness, primarily, as, a, social, dependency, issue, responding, with, social, interventions, at, the, same, time, homeless, south, africans, indicated, that, the, most, important, thing, the, municipality, could, assist, them, with, was, employment, and, well, located, affordable, housing, in, 2011, there, were, approximately, 2, 41, million, homeless, adults, and, 179, 000, homeless, children, living, in, the, country, however, one, publication, estimated, that, there, were, one, million, homeless, children, in, china, in, 2012, housing, in, china, is, highly, regulated, by, the, hukou, system, this, gives, rise, to, a, large, number, of, migrant, workers, numbering, 290, 77, million, in, 2019, these, migrant, workers, have, rural, hukou, but, they, move, to, the, cities, in, order, to, find, better, jobs, though, due, to, their, rural, hukou, they, are, entitled, to, fewer, privileges, than, those, with, urban, hukou, according, to, huili, et, al, these, migrant, workers, live, in, overcrowded, and, unsanitary, conditions, and, are, always, at, risk, of, displacement, to, make, way, for, new, real, estate, developments, in, 2017, the, government, responded, to, a, deadly, fire, in, a, crowded, building, in, beijing, by, cracking, down, on, dense, illegal, shared, accommodations, and, evicting, the, residents, leaving, many, migrant, laborers, homeless, this, comes, in, the, context, of, larger, attempts, by, the, government, to, limit, the, population, increase, in, beijing, often, targeting, migrant, laborers, however, according, to, official, government, statistics, migrant, workers, in, china, have, an, average, of, 20, 4, square, metres, 220, square, feet, of, living, space, per, capita, and, the, vast, majority, of, migrant, workers, have, basic, living, facilities, such, as, heating, bathing, refrigerators, and, washing, machines, several, natural, disasters, have, led, to, homelessness, in, china, the, 2000, yunnan, earthquake, left, 92, 479, homeless, and, destroyed, over, 41, 000, homes, homelessness, among, people, with, mental, health, problems, is, much, less, common, in, china, than, in, high, income, countries, due, to, stronger, family, ties, but, is, increasing, due, to, migration, within, families, and, as, a, result, of, the, one, child, policy, a, study, in, xiangtan, found, at, least, 2439, schizophrenic, people, that, have, been, homeless, on, a, total, population, of, 2, 8, million, it, was, found, that, homelessness, was, more, common, in, individuals, from, rural, communities, where, social, support, services, are, limited, among, those, who, wander, away, from, their, communities, i, e, those, not, from, xiangtan, municipality, and, among, those, with, limited, education, who, are, less, able, to, mobilize, social, supports, homelessness, was, also, associated, with, greater, age, may, be, that, older, patients, have, burned, their, bridges, with, relatives, and, thus, end, up, on, the, streets, during, the, cultural, revolution, a, large, part, of, child, welfare, homes, were, closed, down, leaving, their, inhabitants, homeless, by, the, late, 1990s, many, new, homes, were, set, up, to, accommodate, abandoned, children, in, 1999, the, ministry, of, civil, affairs, estimated, the, number, of, abandoned, children, in, welfare, homes, to, be, 66, 000, according, to, the, ministry, of, civil, affairs, china, had, approximately, 2, 000, shelters, and, 20, 000, social, workers, to, aid, approximately, three, million, homeless, people, in, 2014, from, 2017, to, 2019, the, government, of, guangdong, province, assisted, 5, 388, homeless, people, in, reuniting, with, relatives, elsewhere, in, china, the, guangdong, government, assisted, more, than, 150, 000, people, over, three, years, in, 2020, in, the, wake, of, the, covid, 19, pandemic, the, chinese, ministry, of, civil, affairs, announced, several, actions, of, the, central, committee, in, response, to, homelessness, including, increasing, support, services, and, reuniting, homeless, people, with, their, families, in, wuhan, the, situation, for, homeless, people, was, particularly, bad, as, the, lockdown, made, it, impossible, for, homeless, migrants, to, return, to, other, parts, of, the, country, the, wuhan, civil, affairs, bureau, set, up, 69, shelters, in, the, city, to, house, 4, 843, people, the, universal, declaration, of, human, rights, defines, homeless, as, those, who, do, not, live, in, a, regular, residence, due, to, lack, of, adequate, housing, safety, and, availability, the, united, nations, economic, and, social, council, statement, has, a, broader, definition, for, homelessness, it, defines, homelessness, as, follows, when, we, are, talking, about, housing, we, are, not, just, talking, about, four, walls, and, a, roof, the, right, to, adequate, housing, is, about, the, security, of, tenure, affordability, access, to, services, and, cultural, adequacy, it, is, about, protection, from, forced, eviction, and, displacement, fighting, homelessness, poverty, and, exclusion, india, defines, homeless, as, people, who, do, not, live, in, census, houses, but, rather, stay, on, pavements, roadsides, railway, platforms, staircases, temples, streets, in, pipes, or, other, open, spaces, there, are, 1, 77, million, homeless, people, in, india, or, 0, 15, percent, of, the, country, s, total, population, according, to, the, 2011, census, consisting, of, single, men, women, mothers, the, elderly, and, the, disabled, however, it, is, argued, that, the, numbers, are, far, greater, than, accounted, by, the, point, in, time, method, for, example, while, the, census, of, 2011, counted, 46, 724, homeless, individuals, in, delhi, the, indo, global, social, service, society, counted, them, to, be, 88, 410, and, another, organization, called, the, delhi, development, authority, counted, them, to, be, 150, 000, furthermore, there, is, a, high, proportion, of, mentally, ill, and, street, children, in, the, homeless, population, there, are, 18, million, street, children, in, india, the, largest, number, of, any, country, in, the, world, with, 11, million, being, urban, finally, more, than, three, million, men, and, women, are, homeless, in, india, s, capital, city, of, new, delhi, the, same, population, in, canada, would, make, up, approximately, 30, electoral, districts, a, family, of, four, members, has, an, average, of, five, homeless, generations, in, india, there, is, a, shortage, of, 18, 78, million, houses, in, the, country, the, total, number, of, houses, has, increased, from, 52, 06, million, to, 78, 48, million, as, per, the, 2011, census, however, the, country, still, ranks, as, the, 124th, wealthiest, country, in, the, world, as, of, 2003, more, than, 90, million, people, in, india, make, less, than, us, 1, per, day, thus, setting, them, below, the, global, poverty, threshold, the, ability, of, the, government, of, india, to, tackle, urban, homelessness, and, poverty, may, be, affected, in, the, future, by, both, external, and, internal, factors, the, number, of, people, living, in, slums, in, india, has, more, than, doubled, in, the, past, two, decades, and, now, exceeds, the, entire, population, of, britain, the, indian, government, has, announced, about, 78, million, people, in, india, live, in, slums, and, tenements, seventeen, percent, of, the, world, s, slum, dwellers, reside, in, india, after, the, release, of, the, feature, film, slumdog, millionaire, in, 2008, mumbai, was, a, slum, tourist, destination, for, slumming, where, homeless, people, and, slum, dwellers, alike, could, be, openly, viewed, by, tourists,

including, tunawisma, which, is, used, by, the, government, and, gelandangan, meaning, tramp, squatters, and, street, homeless, people, are, often, targeted, by, police, raids, who, say, that, homeless, people, disturb, the, attractiveness, of, the, city, one, cause, of, homelessness, in, indonesia, is, forced, evictions, according, to, researchers, between, the, years, 2000, and, 2005, over, 92, 000, people, were, forcefully, evicted, from, their, homes, according, to, governor, of, isfahan, homeless, people, are, an, issue, per, revised, article, 16, of, drug, combat, law, the,

space, in, shipping, containers, too, homelessness, in, israel, is, a, phenomenon, that, mostly, developed, after, the, mid, 1980s, homelessness, increased, following, the, wave, of, soviet, immigration, in, 1991, as, many, as, 70, percent, of, homeless, people, in, tel, aviv, are, immigrants, from, the, former, soviet, union, nearly, all, of, them, men, according, to, homeless, shelter,

homeless, people, in, israel, grew, in, the, 2000s, and, the, association, for, civil, rights, in, israel, claimed, that, the, authorities, were, ignoring, the, issue, some, 2, 000, families, in, israel, lose, their, homes, every, year, after, defaulting, on, their, mortgage, loans, however, a, law, amendment, passed, in, 2009, protects, the, rights, of, mortgage, debtors, and, ensures, that, they, are, not, evicted, after, failing, to, meet, mortgage, payments, the, amendment, is, part, of, a, wider, reform, in, the, law, in, the, wake, of, a, lengthy, battle, by, the, association, for, civil, rights, in, israel, and, other, human, rights, groups, in, 2007, the, number, of, homeless, youth, was, on, the, rise, more, than, 25, percent, of, all, homeless, youth, in, 2007, were, girls, compared, to, 15, percent, in, 2004, a, report, by, elem, a, non, profit, organization, that, helps, youth, at, risk, pointed, to, a, five, percent, rise, in, the, number, of, youths, either, homeless, or, wandering, the, streets, late, at, night, while, their, parents, worked, or, due, to, strained, relations, at, home, the, organization, estimated, that, in, 2007, it, provided, programs, or, temporary, shelter, to, roughly, 32, 000, youths, in, some, 30, locations, countrywide, in, 2014, the, number, of, homeless, individuals, in, israel, was, estimated, at, 1, 831, about, 600, of, whom, were, living, on, the, streets, of, tel, aviv, this, makes, up, 0, 02, percent, of, the, country, s, population, a, low, figure, compared, to, other, developed, nations, in, july, 2015, the, welfare, ministry, estimated, the, number, of, homeless, people, to, be, between, 800, and, 900, including, 450, receiving, services, and, treatment, from, their, municipalities, but, continuing, to, live, on, the, streets, elem, claimed, the, true, figure, was, much, higher, in, december, 2015, a, large, study, by, the, welfare, ministry, found, that, 2, 300, people, in, israel, were, homeless,

though, it, is, unclear, if, this, was, partly, due, to, statistics, being, collected, differently, during, the, start, of, the, pandemic, homelessness, in, canada, was, not, a, social, problem, until, the, 1980s, the, canadian, government, housing, policies, and, programs, in, place, throughout, the, 1970s, were, based, on, a, concept, of, shelter, as, a, basic, need, or, requirement, for, survival, and, of, the, obligation, of, government, and, society, to, provide, adequate, housing, for, everyone, public, policies, shifted, away, from, rehousing, in, the, 1980s, in, wealthy, western, countries, like, canada, which, led, to, a, de, housing, of, households, that, had, previously, been, housed, by, 1987, when, the, united, nations, established, the, international, year, of, shelter, for, the, homeless, iysh, homelessness, had, become, a, serious, social, problem, in, canada, the, report, of, the, major, 1987, iysh, conference, held, in, ottawa, said, that, housing, was, not, a, high, priority, for, government, and, this, was, a, significant, contributor, to, the, homelessness, problem, while, there, was, a, demand, for, adequate, and, affordable, housing, for, low, income, canadian, families, government, funding, was, not, available, in, the, 1980s, a, wider, segment, of, the, population, began, to, experience, homelessness, for, the, first, time, evident, through, their, use, of, emergency, shelters, and, soup, kitchens, shelters, began, to, experience, overcrowding, and, demand, for, services, for, the, homeless, was, constantly, increasing, a, series, of, cuts, were, made, to, national, housing, programs, by, the, federal, government, through, the, mid, 1980s, and, in, the, 1990s, while, canada, s, economy, was, robust, the, cuts, continued, and, in, some, cases, accelerated, in, the, 1990s, including, cuts, to, the, 1973, national, affordable, housing, program, the, government, solution, for, homelessness, was, to, create, more, homeless, shelters, and, to, increase, emergency, services, in, the, larger, metropolitan, areas, like, toronto, the, use, of, homeless, shelters, increased, by, 75, from, 1988, to, 1998, urban, centres, such, as, montreal, laval, vancouver, edmonton, and, calgary, all, experienced, increasing, homelessness, after, franklin, d, roosevelt, took, over, the, presidency, from, herbert, hoover, in, 1933, he, oversaw, the, passage, of, the, new, deal, which, greatly, expanded, social, welfare, including, providing, funds, to, build, public, housing, this, marked, the, end, of, the, great, depression, however, the, number, of, homeless, people, grew, in, the, 1980s, when, ronald, reagan, decimated, the, public, housing, budget, in, the, 1980s, including, the, federally, funded, affordable, housing, production, put, in, place, by, the, new, deal, by, the, mid, 1980s, there, was, a, dramatic, increase, in, family, homelessness, tied, into, this, was, an, increasing, number, of, impoverished, and, runaway, children, teenagers, and, young, adults, which, created, a, new, substratum, of, the, homeless, population, street, children, or, street, youth, in, 2015, the, united, states, reported, that, there, were, 564, 708, homeless, people, within, its, borders, one, of, the, higher, reported, figures, worldwide, housing, first, is, an, initiative, to, help, homeless, people, reintegrate, into, society, and, out, of, homeless, shelters, it, was, initiated, by, the, federal, government, s, interagency, council, on, homelessness, it, asks, cities, to, come, up, with, a, plan, to, end, chronic, homelessness, in, this, direction, there, is, the, belief, that, if, homeless, people, are, given, independent, housing, to, start, with, some, proper, social, support, then, there, would, be, no, need, for, emergency, homeless, shelters, which, it, considers, a, good, outcome, however, this, is, a, controversial, position, there, is, evidence, that, the, housing, first, program, works, more, efficiently, than, treatment, first, programs, studies, show, that, having, the, stability, of, housing, through, the, housing, first, program, will, encourage, homeless, people, to, focus, on, other, struggles, they, are, facing, such, as, substance, abuse, meanwhile, treatment, first, programs, promote, an, all, or, nothing, approach, which, requires, clients, to, participate, in, programs, applicable, to, their, struggles, as, a, condition, for, housing, assistance, treatment, first, utilizes, a, less, individualistic, approach, than, housing, first, and, solutions, are, created, under, one, standard, rather, than, fit, each, client, s, specific, needs, in, 2009, it, was, estimated, that, one, out, of, 50, children, or, 1, 5, million, children, in, the, united, states, would, experience, some, form, of, homelessness, each, year, in, 2010, in, new, york, city, where, there, were, over, 36, 000, homeless, people, in, 2009, there, was, a, mobile, video, exhibit, in, the, streets, showing, a, homeless, person, on, a, screen, and, asking, onlookers, and, passersby, to, text, with, their, cellphones, a, message, for, him, and, they, also, could, donate, money, by, cellphones, to, the, organization, pathways, to, housing, in, september, 2010, it, was, reported, that, the, housing, first, initiative, had, significantly, reduced, the, chronic, homeless, single, person, population, in, boston, massachusetts, although, homeless, families, were, still, increasing, in, number, some, shelters, were, reducing, the, number, of, beds, due, to, lowered, numbers, of, homeless, and, some, emergency, shelter, facilities, were, closing, especially, the, emergency, boston, night, center, in, 2011, the, department, of, veterans, affairs, supportive, services, for, veterans, families, initiative, ssvf, began, funding, private, non, profit, organizations, and, consumer, cooperatives, to, provide, supportive, services, to, very, low, income, veteran, families, living, in, or, transitioning, to, permanent, housing, in, 2019, in, an, interview, with, cbs, news, scholar, sara, goldrick, rab, said, that, her, study, on, college, student, homelessness, found, that, early, one, in, ten, college, students, said, they, were, homeless, in, the, last, year, meaning, they, had, at, least, one, night, where, they, did, not, know, where, they, were, going, to, sleep, according, to, the, count, by, the, puerto, rico, department, of, family, in, january, 2017, there, were, 3, 501, homeless, persons, in, the, territory, the, study, shows, that, 26, percent,

and, mayag, ez, at, 4, 7, percent, results, from, the, study, determined, that, 76, percent, of, the, homeless, population, were, men, and, 24, percent, were, women, and, that, both, men, and, women, populations, were, on, average, age, 40, years, old, this, steadily, increasing, population, might, have, increased, more, drastically, as, a, result, of, hurricane, mar, a, which, caused, over, 90, billion, dollars, in, damage, to, the, island, of, puerto, rico, data, provided, by, the, department, of, community, social, development, of, san, juan, indicates, that, in, 1988, the, number, of,

people, per, 10, 000, population, while, the, lowest, was, in, western, australia, 37, people, per, 10, 000, homelessness, in, new, zealand, has, been, linked, to, the, general, issue, of, lack, of, suitable, housing, the, population, of, homeless, people, is, generally, measured, through, the, country, s, census, and, by, universities, and, other, academic, centres, in, 2009, urban,

additional, 8, 000, 20, 000, people, live, in, temporary, accommodation, unsuited, for, long, term, habitation, caravans, campgrounds, substandard, housing, and, boarding, houses, homelessness, in, new, zealand, has, traditionally, been, reduced, by, the, provision, of, state, housing, similar, to, germany, and, other, developed, countries, statistical, authorities, in, new, zealand, have, expanded, their, definition, of, homelessness, to, include, people, living, in, improvised, shelters, people, staying, in, camping, grounds, motor, camps, and, people, sharing, accommodation, with, someone, else, s, household, the, issue, is, believed, to, have, become, increasingly, visible, in, recent, years, media, in, new, zealand, have, published, an, accusatory, account, of, the, presence, of, homeless, people, in, public, spaces, positioning, homeless, men, as, disruptive, threats, though, community, members, have, shown, support, by, writing, opinion, pieces, in, january, 2019, the, new, york, times, reported, rising, housing, prices, to, be, a, major, factor, in, the, increasing, homelessness, in, new, zealand, so, that, smaller, markets, like, tauranga, a, coastal, city, on, the, north, island, with, a, population, of, 128, 000, had, seen, an, influx, of, people, who, had, left, auckland, in, search, of, more, affordable, housing, average, property, values, in, tauranga, had, risen, to, 497, 000, from, 304, 000, in, the, last, five, years, and, demographia, now, rated, it, among, the, 10, least, affordable, cities, in, the, world, along, with, famously, expensive, locales, such, as, hong, kong, san, francisco, sydney, and, vancouver, british, columbia, in, august, 2019, the, associate, housing, minister, kris, faafoi, and, social, development, minister, carmel, sepuloni, announced, that, the, government, would, be, launching, a, nz, 54, million, program, to, tackle, homelessness, in, new, zealand, this, includes, investing, 31, million, over, the, next, four, years, for, 67, intensive, case, managers, and, navigators, to, work, with, homeless, people, and, a, further, 16, million, for, the, sustaining, tenancies, programme, this, funding, complements, the, government, s, housing, first, programme, after, the, abolition, of, serfdom, in, russia, in, 1861, major, cities, experienced, a, large, influx, of, former, peasants, who, sought, jobs, as, industrial, workers, in, rapidly, developing, russian, industry, these, people, often, lived, in, harsh, conditions, sometimes, renting, a, room, shared, between, several, families, there, also, was, a, large, number, of, shelterless, homeless, people, immediately, after, the, october, revolution, a, special, program, of, compression, was, enabled, people, who, had, no, shelter, were, settled, in, flats, of, those, who, had, large, 4, 5, or, 6, room, flats, with, only, one, room, left, to, previous, owners, the, flat, was, declared, state, property, this, led, to, a, large, number, of, shared, flats, where, several, families, lived, simultaneously, nevertheless, the, problem, of, complete, homelessness, was, mostly, solved, as, anybody, could, apply, for, a, room, or, a, place, in, a, dormitory, the, number, of, shared, flats, steadily, decreased, after, the, large, scale, residential, building, program, was, implemented, starting, in, the, 1960s, by, 1922, there, were, at, least, seven, million, homeless, children, in, russia, as, a, result, of, nearly, a, decade, of, devastation, from, world, war, i, and, the, russian, civil, war, this, led, to, the, creation, of, a, large, number, of, orphanages, by, the, 1930s, the, ussr, declared, the, abolition, of, homelessness, and, any, citizen, was, obliged, to, have, a, propiska, a, place, of, permanent, residency, nobody, could, be, stripped, of, propiska, without, substitution, or, refuse, it, without, a, confirmed, permission, called, order, to, register, in, another, place, if, someone, wanted, to, move, to, another, city, or, expand, their, living, area, he, had, to, find, a, partner, who, wanted, to, mutually, exchange, the, flats, the, right, to, shelter, was, secured, in, the, soviet, constitution, not, having, permanent, residency, was, considered, a, crime, after, the, breakup, of, the, ussr, the, problem, of, homelessness, sharpened, dramatically, partially, because, of, the, legal, vacuum, of, the, early, 1990s, with, some, laws, contradicting, each, other, and, partially, because, of, a, high, rate, of, fraud, in, the, realty, market, in, 1991, articles, 198, and, 209, of, the, russian, criminal, code, which, instituted, a, criminal, penalty, for, not, having, permanent, residence, were, abolished, in, moscow, the, first, overnight, shelter, for, homeless, people, was, opened, in, 1992, in, the, late, 1990s, certain, amendments, in, law, were, implemented, to, reduce, the, rise, in, homelessness, such, as, the, prohibition, of, selling, last, flats, with, registered, children, in, 2002, there, were, 300, 000, homeless, people, in, moscow, nevertheless, the, state, is, still, obliged, to, give, permanent, shelter, for, free, to, anybody, who, needs, better, living, conditions, or, has, no, permanent, registration, because, the, right, to, shelter, is, still, included, in, the, constitution, several, projects, of, special, cheap, social, flats, for, those, who, failed, to, repay, mortgages, were, proposed, to, facilitate, the, mortgage, market, in, 2022, it, was, reported, that, russian, authorities, were, targeting, homeless, people, to, conscript, them, into, the, war, in, ukraine, in, western, countries, such, as, the, united, states, the, typical, homeless, person, is, male, and, single, with, the, netherlands, reporting, 80, percent, of, homeless, people, aged, 18, 65, to, be, men, some, cities, have, particularly, high, percentages, of, males, in, homeless, populations, with, men, comprising, 85, percent, of, the, homeless, in, dublin, ireland, non, white, people, are, also, overrepresented, in, homeless, populations, with, such, groups, two, and, one, half, times, more, likely, to, be, homeless, in, the, u, s, the, median, age, of, homeless, people, is, approximately, 35, in, 2005, an, estimated, 100, million, people, worldwide, were, homeless, the, following, statistics, indicate, the, approximate, average, number, of, homeless, people, at, any, one, time, each, country, has, a, different, approach, to, counting, homeless, people, and, estimates, of, homelessness, made, by, different, organizations, vary, wildly, so, comparisons, should, be, made, with, caution, the, number, of, homeless, people, worldwide, grew, steadily, in, 2005, in, some, developing, countries, such, as, nigeria, and, south, africa, homelessness, is, rampant, with, millions, of, children, living, and, working, on, the, streets, homelessness, has, become, a, problem, in, the, countries, of, china, india, thailand, indonesia, and, the, philippines, despite, their, growing, prosperity, partly, due, to, migrant, workers, who, have, trouble, finding, permanent, homes, determining, the, true, number, of, homeless, people, worldwide, varies, between, 100, million, and, one, billion, people, based, on, the, exact, definition, used, refugees, asylum, seekers, and, internally, displaced, persons, can, also, be, considered, homeless, in, that, they, too, experience, marginalization, minority, status, socioeconomic, disadvantage, poor, physical, health, the, collapse, of, social, supports, psychological, distress, and, difficulty, adapting, to, host, cultures, such, as, the, domestic, homeless, in, the, past, twenty, years, scholars, such, as, tipple, and, speak, have, begun, to, refer, to, homelessness, as, the, antithesis, or, absence, of, home, rather, than, rooflessness, or, the, lack, of, physical, shelter, this, complication, in, the, homelessness, debate, further, delineates, the, idea, that, home, consists, of, an, adequate, shelter, an, experienced, and, dynamic, place, that, serves, as, a, base, for, nurturing, human, relationships, and, the, free, development, of, individuals, and, their, identity, thus, the, home, is, perceived, to, be, an, extension, of, one, s, self, and, identity, in, contrast, the, homeless, experience, according, to, moore, constitutes, more, as, a, lack, of, belonging, and, a, loss, of, identity, that, leads, to, individuals, or, communities, feeling, out, of, place, once, they, can, no, longer, call, a, place, of, their, own, home, this, new, perspective, on, homelessness, sheds, light, on, the, plight, of, refugees, a, population, of, stateless, people, who, are, not, normally, included, in, the, mainstream, definition, of, homelessness, it, has, also, created, problems, for, researchers, because, the, nature, of, counting, homeless, people, across, the, globe, relies, heavily, on, who, is, considered, a, homeless, person, homeless, individuals, and, by, extension, refugees, can, be, seen, as, lacking, lack, the, crucible, of, our, modern, society, and, lacking, a, way, of, actively, belonging, to, and, engaging, with, their, respective, communities, or, cultures, as, casavant, demonstrates, a, spectrum, of, definitions, for, homelessness, called, the, continuum, of, homelessness, should, refer, to, refugees, as, homeless, individuals, because, they, not, only, lose, their, homes, but, are, also, afflicted, with, a, myriad, of, problems, that, parallel, those, affecting, the, domestic, homeless, such, as, stable, safe, and, healthy, housing, an, extremely, low, income, adverse, discrimination, in, access, to, services, with, problems, of, mental, health, alcohol, and, drug, abuse, or, social, disorganization, refugees, like, domestic, homeless, people, lose, their, source, of, identity, and, way, of, connecting, with, their, culture, for, an, indefinite, period, thus, the, current, definition, of, homelessness, allows, people, to, simplistically, assume, that, homeless, people, including, refugees, are, merely, without, a, place, to, live, when, that, is, not, the, case, as, numerous, studies, show, forced, migration, and, displacement, bring, with, it, another, host, of, problems, including, socioeconomic, instability, increased, stress, isolation, and, new, responsibilities, in, a, completely, new, environment, for, people, in, russia, especially, the, youth, alcohol, and, substance, use, is, a, major, cause, and, reason, for, becoming, and, continuing, to, be, homeless, the, united, nations, centre, for, human, settlements, un, habitat, wrote, in, its, global, report, on, human, settlements, in, 1995, homelessness, is, a, problem, in, developed, as, well, as, in, developing, countries, in, london, for, example, life, expectancy, among, homeless, people, is, more, than, 25, years, lower, than, the, national, average, poor, urban, housing, conditions, are, a, global, problem, but, conditions, are, worst, in, developing, countries, habitat, says, that, today, 600, million, people, live, in, life, and, health, threatening, homes, in, africa, asia, and, latin, america, for, example, more, than, three, in, four, young, people, had, insufficient, means, of, shelter, and, sanitation, in, some, african, countries, like, malawi, the, report, further, states, the, threat, of, mass, homelessness, is, greatest, in, those, regions, because, that, is, where, the, population, is, growing, fastest, by, 2015, the, 10, largest, cities, in, the, world, will, be, in, asia, latin, america, and, africa, nine, of, them, will, be, in, developing, countries, mumbai, india, 27, 4, million, lagos, nigeria, 24, 4, shanghai, china, 23,

world, s, cities, report, 2008, 2009, said, that, the, world, economic, crisis, we, are, in, should, be, viewed, as, a, housing, finance, crisis, in, which, the, poorest, of, the, poor, were, left, to, fend, for, themselves, there, are, various, places, where, a, homeless, person, might, seek, refuge, transitional, housing, provides, temporary, housing, for, certain, segments, of, the, homeless, population, including, the, working, homeless, and, is, meant, to, transition, residents, into, permanent, affordable, housing, this, is, usually, a, room, or, apartment, in, a, residence, with, support, services, the, transitional, time, can, be, relatively, short, for, example, one, or, two, years, and, in, that, time, the, person, must, file, for, and, obtain, permanent, housing, along, with, gainful, employment, or, income, even, if, social, security, or, assistance, sometimes, transitional, housing, programs, charge, a, room, and, board, fee, maybe, 30, percent, of, an, individual,

serious, challenges, a, 2021, systematic, review, of, 28, interventions, mostly, in, north, america, showed, that, interventions, with, the, highest, levels, of, support, led, to, improved, outcomes,
