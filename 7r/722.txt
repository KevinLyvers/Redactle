privacy, uk, p, r, v, s, i, us, p, r, a, is, the, ability, of, an, individual, or, group, to, seclude, themselves, or, information, about, themselves, and, thereby, express, themselves, selectively, the, domain, of, privacy, partially, overlaps, with, security, which, can, include, the, concepts, of, appropriate, use, and, protection, of, information, privacy, may, also, take, the, form, of, bodily, integrity, throughout, history, there, have, been, various, conceptions, of, privacy, most, cultures, acknowledge, the, right, of, individuals, to, keep, aspects, of, their, personal, lives, out, of, the, public, domain, the, right, to, be, free, from, unauthorized, invasions, of, privacy, by, governments, corporations, or, individuals, is, enshrined, in, the, privacy, laws, of, many, countries, and, in, some, instances, their, constitutions, with, the, rise, of, technology, the, debate, regarding, privacy, has, expanded, from, a, bodily, sense, to, include, a, digital, sense, in, most, countries, the, right, to, digital, privacy, is, considered, an, extension, of, the, original, right, to, privacy, and, many, countries, have, passed, acts, that, further, protect, digital, privacy, from, public, and, private, entities, there, are, multiple, techniques, to, invade, privacy, which, may, be, employed, by, corporations, or, governments, for, profit, or, political, reasons, conversely, in, order, to, protect, privacy, people, may, employ, encryption, or, anonymity, measures, the, word, privacy, is, derived, from, the, latin, word, privatus, which, means, set, apart, from, what, is, public, personal, and, belonging, to, oneself, and, not, to, the, state, it, is, also, derived, from, the, latin, word, privo, which, conveys, the, idea, of, deprivation, or, being, robbed, of, the, concept, of, privacy, has, been, explored, and, discussed, by, numerous, philosophers, throughout, history, privacy, has, historical, roots, in, ancient, greek, philosophical, discussions, the, most, well, known, of, these, was, aristotle, s, distinction, between, two, spheres, of, life, the, public, sphere, of, the, polis, associated, with, political, life, and, the, private, sphere, of, the, oikos, associated, with, domestic, life, privacy, is, valued, along, with, other, basic, necessities, of, life, in, the, jewish, deutero, canonical, book, of, sirach, english, philosopher, john, locke, s, 1632, 1704, writings, on, natural, rights, and, the, social, contract, laid, the, groundwork, for, modern, conceptions, of, individual, rights, including, the, right, to, privacy, in, his, second, treatise, of, civil, government, 1689, locke, argued, that, a, man, is, entitled, to, his, own, self, through, one, s, natural, rights, of, life, liberty, and, property, he, believed, that, the, government, was, responsible, for, protecting, these, rights, so, individuals, were, guaranteed, private, spaces, to, practice, personal, activities, in, the, political, sphere, philosophers, hold, differing, views, on, the, right, of, private, judgment, german, philosopher, georg, wilhelm, friedrich, hegel, 1770, 1831, makes, the, distinction, between, moralit, t, which, refers, to, an, individual, s, private, judgment, and, sittlichkeit, pertaining, to, one, s, rights, and, obligations, as, defined, by, an, existing, corporate, order, on, the, contrary, jeremy, bentham, 1748, 1832, an, english, philosopher, interpreted, law, as, an, invasion, of, privacy, his, theory, of, utilitarianism, argued, that, legal, actions, should, be, judged, by, the, extent, of, their, contribution, to, human, wellbeing, or, necessary, utility, hegel, s, notions, were, modified, by, prominent, 19th, century, english, philosopher, john, stuart, mill, mill, s, essay, on, liberty, 1859, argued, for, the, importance, of, protecting, individual, liberty, against, the, tyranny, of, the, majority, and, the, interference, of, the, state, his, views, emphasized, the, right, of, privacy, as, essential, for, personal, development, and, self, expression, discussions, surrounding, surveillance, coincided, with, philosophical, ideas, on, privacy, jeremy, bentham, developed, the, phenomenon, known, as, the, panoptic, effect, through, his, 1791, architectural, design, of, a, prison, called, panopticon, the, phenomenon, explored, the, possibility, of, surveillance, as, a, general, awareness, of, being, watched, that, could, never, be, proven, at, any, particular, moment, french, philosopher, michel, foucault, 1926, 1984, concluded, that, the, possibility, of, surveillance, in, the, instance, of, the, panopticon, meant, a, prisoner, had, no, choice, but, to, conform, to, the, prison, s, rules, as, technology, has, advanced, the, way, in, which, privacy, is, protected, and, violated, has, changed, with, it, in, the, case, of, some, technologies, such, as, the, printing, press, or, the, internet, the, increased, ability, to, share, information, can, lead, to, new, ways, in, which, privacy, can, be, breached, it, is, generally, agreed, that, the, first, publication, advocating, privacy, in, the, united, states, was, the, 1890, article, by, samuel, warren, and, louis, brandeis, the, right, to, privacy, and, that, it, was, written, mainly, in, response, to, the, increase, in, newspapers, and, photographs, made, possible, by, printing, technologies, in, 1948, 1984, written, by, george, orwell, was, published, a, classic, dystopian, novel, 1984, describes, the, life, of, winston, smith, in, 1984, located, in, oceania, a, totalitarian, state, the, all, controlling, party, the, party, in, power, led, by, big, brother, is, able, to, control, power, through, mass, surveillance, and, limited, freedom, of, speech, and, thought, george, orwell, provides, commentary, on, the, negative, effects, of, totalitarianism, particularly, on, privacy, and, censorship, parallels, have, been, drawn, between, 1984, and, modern, censorship, and, privacy, a, notable, example, being, that, large, social, media, companies, rather, than, the, government, are, able, to, monitor, a, user, s, data, and, decide, what, is, allowed, to, be, said, online, through, their, censorship, policies, ultimately, for, monetary, purposes, in, the, 1960s, people, began, to, consider, how, changes, in, technology, were, bringing, changes, in, the, concept, of, privacy, vance, packard, s, the, naked, society, was, a, popular, book, on, privacy, from, that, era, and, led, us, discourse, on, privacy, at, that, time, in, addition, alan, westin, s, privacy, and, freedom, shifted, the, debate, regarding, privacy, from, a, physical, sense, how, the, government, controls, a, person, s, body, i, e, roe, v, wade, and, other, activities, such, as, wiretapping, and, photography, as, important, records, became, digitized, westin, argued, that, personal, data, was, becoming, too, accessible, and, that, a, person, should, have, complete, jurisdiction, over, their, data, laying, the, foundation, for, the, modern, discussion, of, privacy, new, technologies, can, also, create, new, ways, to, gather, private, information, in, 2001, the, legal, case, kyllo, v, united, states, 533, u, s, 27, determined, that, the, use, of, thermal, imaging, devices, that, can, reveal, previously, unknown, information, without, a, warrant, constitutes, a, violation, of, privacy, in, 2019, after, developing, a, corporate, rivalry, in, competing, voice, recognition, software, apple, and, amazon, required, employees, to, listen, to, intimate, moments, and, faithfully, transcribe, the, contents, police, and, citizens, often, conflict, on, what, degree, the, police, can, intrude, a, citizen, s, digital, privacy, for, instance, in, 2012, the, supreme, court, ruled, unanimously, in, united, states, v, jones, 565, u, s, 400, in, the, case, of, antoine, jones, who, was, arrested, of, drug, possession, using, a, gps, tracker, on, his, car, that, was, placed, without, a, warrant, that, warrantless, tracking, infringes, the, fourth, amendment, the, supreme, court, also, justified, that, there, is, some, reasonable, expectation, of, privacy, in, transportation, since, the, reasonable, expectation, of, privacy, had, already, been, established, under, griswold, v, connecticut, 1965, the, supreme, court, also, further, clarified, that, the, fourth, amendment, did, not, only, pertain, to, physical, instances, of, intrusion, but, also, digital, instances, and, thus, united, states, v, jones, became, a, landmark, case, in, 2014, the, supreme, court, ruled, unanimously, in, riley, v, california, 573, u, s, 373, where, david, leon, riley, was, arrested, after, he, was, pulled, over, for, driving, on, expired, license, tags, when, the, police, searched, his, phone, and, discovered, that, he, was, tied, to, a, shooting, that, searching, a, citizen, s, phone, without, a, warrant, was, an, unreasonable, search, a, violation, of, the, fourth, amendment, the, supreme, court, concluded, that, the, cell, phones, contained, personal, information, different, from, trivial, items, and, went, beyond, to, state, that, information, stored, on, the, cloud, was, not, necessarily, a, form, of, evidence, riley, v, california, evidently, became, a, landmark, case, protecting, the, digital, protection, of, citizen, s, privacy, when, confronted, with, the, police, a, recent, notable, occurrence, of, the, conflict, between, law, enforcement, and, a, citizen, in, terms, of, digital, privacy, has, been, in, the, 2018, case, carpenter, v, united, states, 585, u, s, in, this, case, the, fbi, used, cell, phone, records, without, a, warrant, to, arrest, timothy, ivory, carpenter, on, multiple, charges, and, the, supreme, court, ruled, that, the, warrantless, search, of, cell, phone, records, violated, the, fourth, amendment, citing, that, the, fourth, amendment, protects, reasonable, expectations, of, privacy, and, that, information, sent, to, third, parties, still, falls, under, data, that, can, be, included, under, reasonable, expectations, of, privacy, beyond, law, enforcement, many, interactions, between, the, government, and, citizens, have, been, revealed, either, lawfully, or, unlawfully, specifically, through, whistleblowers, one, notable, example, is, edward, snowden, who, released, multiple, operations, related, to, the, mass, surveillance, operations, of, the, national, security, agency, nsa, where, it, was, discovered, that, the, nsa, continues, to, breach, the, security, of, millions, of, people, mainly, through, mass, surveillance, programs, whether, it, was, collecting, great, amounts, of, data, through, third, party, private, companies, hacking, into, other, embassies, or, frameworks, of, international, countries, and, various, breaches, of, data, which, prompted, a, culture, shock, and, stirred, international, debate, related, to, digital, privacy, the, internet, and, technologies, built, on, it, enable, new, forms, of, social, interactions, at, increasingly, faster, speeds, and, larger, scales, because, the, computer, networks, which, underlie, the, internet, introduce, such, a, wide, range, of, novel, security, concerns, the, discussion, of, privacy, on, the, internet, is, often, conflated, with, security, indeed, many, entities, such, as, corporations, involved, in, the, surveillance, economy, inculcate, a, security, focused, conceptualization, of, privacy, which, reduces, their, obligations, to, uphold, privacy, into, a, matter, of, regulatory, compliance, while, at, the, same, time, lobbying, to, minimize, those, regulatory, requirements, the, internet, s, effect, on, privacy, includes, all, of, the, ways, that, computational, technology, and, the, entities, that, control, it, can, subvert, the, privacy, expectations, of, their, users, in, particular, the, right, to, be, forgotten, is, motivated, by, both, the, computational, ability, to, store, and, search, through, massive, amounts, of, data, as, well, as, the, subverted, expectations, of, users, who, share, information, online, without, expecting, it, to, be, stored, and, retained, indefinitely, phenomena, such, as, revenge, porn, and, deepfakes, are, not, merely, individual, because, they, require, both, the, ability, to, obtain, images, without, someone, s, consent, as, well, as, the, social, and, economic, infrastructure, to, disseminate, that, content, widely, therefore, privacy, advocacy, groups, such, as, the, cyber, civil, rights, initiative, and, the, electronic, frontier, foundation, argue, that, addressing, the, new, privacy, harms, introduced, by, the, internet, requires, both, technological, improvements, to, encryption, and, anonymity, as, well, as, societal, efforts, such, as, legal, regulations, to, restrict, corporate, and, government, power, while, the, internet, began, as, a, government, and, academic, effort, up, through, the, 1980s, private, corporations, began, to, enclose, the, hardware, and, software, of, the, internet, in, the, 1990s, and, now, most, internet, infrastructure, is, owned, and, managed, by, for, profit, corporations, as, a, result, the, ability, of, governments, to, protect, their, citizens, privacy, is, largely, restricted, to, industrial, policy, instituting, controls, on, corporations, that, handle, communications, or, personal, data, privacy, regulations, are, often, further, constrained, to, only, protect, specific, demographics, such, as, children, or, specific, industries, such, as, credit, card, bureaus, several, online, social, network, sites, osns, are, among, the, top, 10, most, visited, websites, globally, facebook, for, example, as, of, august, 2015, was, the, largest, social, networking, site, with, nearly, 2, 7, billion, members, who, upload, over, 4, 75, billion, pieces, of, content, daily, while, twitter, is, significantly, smaller, with, 316, million, registered, users, the, us, library, of, congress, recently, announced, that, it, will, be, acquiring, and, permanently, storing, the, entire, archive, of, public, twitter, posts, since, 2006, a, review, and, evaluation, of, scholarly, work, regarding, the, current, state, of, the, value, of, individuals, privacy, of, online, social, networking, show, the, following, results, first, adults, seem, to, be, more, concerned, about, potential, privacy, threats, than, younger, users, second, policy, makers, should, be, alarmed, by, a, large, part, of, users, who, underestimate, risks, of, their, information, privacy, on, osns, third, in, the, case, of, using, osns, and, its, services, traditional, one, dimensional, privacy, approaches, fall, short, this, is, exacerbated, by, deanonymization, research, indicating, that, personal, traits, such, as, sexual, orientation, race, religious, and, political, views, personality, or, intelligence, can, be, inferred, based, on, a, wide, variety, of, digital, footprints, such, as, samples, of, text, browsing, logs, or, facebook, likes, intrusions, of, social, media, privacy, are, known, to, affect, employment, in, the, united, states, microsoft, reports, that, 75, percent, of, u, s, recruiters, and, human, resource, professionals, now, do, online, research, about, candidates, often, using, information, provided, by, search, engines, social, networking, sites, photo, video, sharing, sites, personal, web, sites, and, blogs, and, twitter, they, also, report, that, 70, percent, of, u, s, recruiters, have, rejected, candidates, based, on, internet, information, this, has, created, a, need, by, many, candidates, to, control, various, online, privacy, settings, in, addition, to, controlling, their, online, reputations, the, conjunction, of, which, has, led, to, legal, suits, against, both, social, media, sites, and, us, employers, selfies, are, popular, today, a, search, for, photos, with, the, hashtag, selfie, retrieves, over, 23, million, results, on, instagram, and, 51, million, with, the, hashtag, me, however, due, to, modern, corporate, and, governmental, surveillance, this, may, pose, a, risk, to, privacy, in, a, research, study, which, takes, a, sample, size, of, 3763, researchers, found, that, for, users, posting, selfies, on, social, media, women, generally, have, greater, concerns, over, privacy, than, men, and, that, users, privacy, concerns, inversely, predict, their, selfie, behavior, and, activity, an, invasion, of, someone, s, privacy, may, be, widely, and, quickly, disseminated, over, the, internet, when, social, media, sites, and, other, online, communities, fail, to, invest, in, content, moderation, an, invasion, of, privacy, can, expose, people, to, a, much, greater, volume, and, degree, of, harassment, than, would, otherwise, be, possible, revenge, porn, may, lead, to, misogynist, or, homophobic, harassment, such, as, in, the, suicide, of, amanda, todd, and, the, suicide, of, tyler, clementi, when, someone, s, physical, location, or, other, sensitive, information, is, leaked, over, the, internet, via, doxxing, harassment, may, escalate, to, direct, physical, harm, such, as, stalking, or, swatting, despite, the, way, breaches, of, privacy, can, magnify, online, harassment, online, harassment, is, often, used, as, a, justification, to, curtail, freedom, of, speech, by, removing, the, expectation, of, privacy, via, anonymity, or, by, enabling, law, enforcement, to, invade, privacy, without, a, search, warrant, in, the, wake, of, amanda, todd, s, death, the, canadian, parliament, proposed, a, motion, purporting, to, stop, bullying, but, todd, s, mother, herself, gave, testimony, to, parliament, rejecting, the, bill, due, to, its, provisions, for, warrantless, breaches, of, privacy, stating, i, don, t, want, to, see, our, children, victimized, again, by, losing, privacy, rights, even, where, these, laws, have, been, passed, despite, privacy, concerns, they, have, not, demonstrated, a, reduction, in, online, harassment, when, the, korea, communications, commission, introduced, a, registration, system, for, online, commenters, in, 2007, they, reported, that, malicious, comments, only, decreased, by, 0, 9, and, in, 2011, it, was, repealed, a, subsequent, analysis, found, that, the, set, of, users, who, posted, the, most, comments, actually, increased, the, number, of, aggressive, expressions, when, forced, to, use, their, real, name, in, the, us, while, federal, law, only, prohibits, online, harassment, based, on, protected, characteristics, such, as, gender, and, race, individual, states, have, expanded, the, definition, of, harassment, to, further, curtail, speech, florida, s, definition, of, online, harassment, includes, any, use, of, data, or, computer, software, that, has, the, effect, of, substantially, disrupting, the, orderly, operation, of, a, school, increasingly, mobile, devices, facilitate, location, tracking, this, creates, user, privacy, problems, a, user, s, location, and, preferences, constitute, personal, information, and, their, improper, use, violates, that, user, s, privacy, a, recent, mit, study, by, de, montjoye, et, al, showed, that, four, spatio, temporal, points, constituting, approximate, places, and, times, are, enough, to, uniquely, identify, 95, of, 1, 5m, people, in, a, mobility, database, the, study, further, shows, that, these, constraints, hold, even, when, the, resolution, of, the, dataset, is, low, therefore, even, coarse, or, blurred, datasets, confer, little, privacy, protection, several, methods, to, protect, user, privacy, in, location, based, services, have, been, proposed, including, the, use, of, anonymizing, servers, and, blurring, of, information, methods, to, quantify, privacy, have, also, been, proposed, to, calculate, the, equilibrium, between, the, benefit, of, obtaining, accurate, location, information, and, the, risks, of, breaching, an, individual, s, privacy, there, have, been, scandals, regarding, location, privacy, one, instance, was, the, scandal, concerning, accuweather, where, it, was, revealed, that, accuweather, was, selling, locational, data, this, consisted, of, a, user, s, locational, data, even, if, they, opted, out, within, accuweather, which, tracked, users, location, accuweather, sold, this, data, to, reveal, mobile, a, company, that, monetizes, data, related, to, a, user, s, location, other, international, cases, are, similar, to, the, accuweather, case, in, 2017, a, leaky, api, inside, the, mcdelivery, app, exposed, private, data, which, consisted, of, home, addresses, of, 2, 2, million, users, in, the, wake, of, these, types, of, scandals, many, large, american, technology, companies, such, as, google, apple, and, facebook, have, been, subjected, to, hearings, and, pressure, under, the, u, s, legislative, system, in, 2011, us, senator, al, franken, wrote, an, open, letter, to, steve, jobs, noting, the, ability, of, iphones, and, ipads, to, record, and, store, users, locations, in, unencrypted, files, apple, claimed, this, was, an, unintentional, software, bug, but, justin, brookman, of, the, center, for, democracy, and, technology, directly, challenged, that, portrayal, stating, i, m, glad, that, they, are, fixing, what, they, call, bugs, but, i, take, exception, with, their, strong, denial, that, they, track, users, in, 2021, the, u, s, state, of, arizona, found, in, a, court, case, that, google, misled, its, users, and, stored, the, location, of, users, regardless, of, their, location, settings, the, internet, has, become, a, significant, medium, for, advertising, with, digital, marketing, making, up, approximately, half, of, the, global, ad, spending, in, 2019, while, websites, are, still, able, to, sell, advertising, space, without, tracking, including, via, contextual, advertising, digital, ad, brokers, such, as, facebook, and, google, have, instead, encouraged, the, practice, of, behavioral, advertising, providing, code, snippets, used, by, website, owners, to, track, their, users, via, http, cookies, this, tracking, data, is, also, sold, to, other, third, parties, as, part, of, the, mass, surveillance, industry, since, the, introduction, of, mobile, phones, data, brokers, have, also, been, planted, within, apps, resulting, in, a, 350, billion, digital, industry, especially, focused, on, mobile, devices, digital, privacy, has, become, the, main, source, of, concern, for, many, mobile, users, especially, with, the, rise, of, privacy, scandals, such, as, the, facebook, cambridge, analytica, data, scandal, apple, has, received, some, reactions, for, features, that, prohibit, advertisers, from, tracking, a, user, s, data, without, their, consent, google, attempted, to, introduce, an, alternative, to, cookies, named, floc, which, it, claimed, reduced, the, privacy, harms, but, it, later, retracted, the, proposal, due, to, antitrust, probes, and, analyses, that, contradicted, their, claims, of, privacy, the, ability, to, do, online, inquiries, about, individuals, has, expanded, dramatically, over, the, last, decade, importantly, directly, observed, behavior, such, as, browsing, logs, search, queries, or, contents, of, a, public, facebook, profile, can, be, automatically, processed, to, infer, secondary, information, about, an, individual, such, as, sexual, orientation, political, and, religious, views, race, substance, use, intelligence, and, personality, in, australia, the, telecommunications, interception, and, access, amendment, data, retention, act, 2015, made, a, distinction, between, collecting, the, contents, of, messages, sent, between, users, and, the, metadata, surrounding, those, messages, most, countries, give, citizens, rights, to, privacy, in, their, constitutions, representative, examples, of, this, include, the, constitution, of, brazil, which, says, the, privacy, private, life, honor, and, image, of, people, are, inviolable, the, constitution, of, south, africa, says, that, everyone, has, a, right, to, privacy, and, the, constitution, of, the, republic, of,

describe, privacy, rights, court, decisions, have, interpreted, their, constitutions, to, intend, to, give, privacy, rights, many, countries, have, broad, privacy, laws, outside, their, constitutions, including, australia, s, privacy, act, 1988, argentina, s, law, for, the, protection, of, personal, data, of, 2000, canada, s, 2000, personal, information, protection, and, electronic, documents, act,

2004, privacy, framework, by, the, asia, pacific, economic, cooperation, is, a, privacy, protection, agreement, for, the, members, of, that, organization, approaches, to, privacy, can, broadly, be, divided, into, two, categories, free, market, or, consumer, protection, one, example, of, the, free, market, approach, is, to, be, found, in, the, voluntary, oecd, guidelines, on, the, protection, of, privacy, and, transborder, flows, of, personal, data, the, principles, reflected, in, the, guidelines, free, of, legislative, interference, are, analyzed, in, an, article, putting, them, into, perspective, with, concepts, of, the, gdpr, put, into, law, later, in, the, european, union, in, a, consumer, protection, approach, in, contrast, it, is, claimed, that, individuals, may, not, have, the, time, or, knowledge, to, make, informed, choices, or, may, not, have, reasonable, alternatives, available, in, support, of, this, view, jensen, and, potts, showed, that, most, privacy, policies, are, above, the, reading, level, of, the, average, person, the, privacy, act, 1988, is, administered, by, the, office, of, the, australian, information, commissioner, the, initial, introduction, of,

held, by, government, institutions, the, provinces, and, territories, would, later, follow, suit, with, their, own, legislation, generally, the, purposes, of, said, legislation, are, to, provide, individuals, rights, to, access, personal, information, to, have, inaccurate, personal, information, corrected, and, to, prevent, unauthorized, collection, use, and, disclosure, of, personal, information, in, terms, of, regulating, personal, information, in, the, private, sector, the, federal, personal, information, protection, and, electronic, documents, act, pipeda, is, enforceable, in, all, jurisdictions, unless, a, substantially, similar, provision, has, been, enacted, on, the, provincial, level, however, inter, provincial, or, international, information, transfers, still, engage, pipeda, pipeda, has, gone, through, two, law, overhaul, efforts, in, 2021, and, 2023, with, the, involvement, of, the, office, of, the, privacy, commissioner, and, canadian, academics, in, the, absence, of, a, statutory, private, right, of, action, absent, an, opc, investigation, the, common, law, torts, of, intrusion, upon, seclusion, and, public, disclosure, of, private, facts, as, well, as, the, civil, code, of, quebec, may, be, brought, for, an, infringement, or, violation, of, privacy, privacy, is, also, protected, under, ss, 7, and, 8, of, the, canadian, charter, of, rights, and, freedoms, which, is, typically, applied, in, the, criminal, law, context, in, quebec, individuals, privacy, is, safeguarded, by, articles, 3, and, 35, to, 41, of, the, civil, code, of, quebec, as, well, as, by, s, 5, of, the, charter, of, human, rights, and, freedoms, in, 2016, the, european, union, passed, the, general, data, protection, regulation, gdpr, which, was, intended, to, reduce, the, misuse, of, personal, data, and, enhance, individual, privacy, by, requiring, companies, to, receive, consent, before, acquiring, personal, information, from, users, although, there, are, comprehensive, regulations, for, data, protection, in, the, european, union, one, study, finds, that, despite, the, laws, there, is, a, lack, of, enforcement, in, that, no, institution, feels, responsible, to, control, the, parties, involved, and, enforce, their, laws, the, european, union, also, champions, the, right, to, be, forgotten, concept, in, support, of, its, adoption, by, other, countries, since, the, introduction, of, the, aadhaar, project, in, 2009, which, resulted, in, all, 1, 2, billion, indians, being, associated, with, a, 12, digit, biometric, secured, number, aadhaar, has, uplifted, the, poor, in, india, by, providing, them, with, a, form, of, identity, and, preventing, the, fraud, and, waste, of, resources, as, normally, the, government, would, not, be, able, to, allocate, its, resources, to, its, intended, assignees, due, to, the, id, issues, with, the, rise, of, aadhaar, india, has, debated, whether, aadhaar, violates, an, individual, s, privacy, and, whether, any, organization, should, have, access, to, an, individual, s, digital, profile, as, the, aadhaar, card, became, associated, with, other, economic, sectors, allowing, for, the, tracking, of, individuals, by, both, public, and, private, bodies, aadhaar, databases, have, suffered, from, security, attacks, as, well, and, the, project, was, also, met, with, mistrust, regarding, the, safety, of, the, social, protection, infrastructures, in, 2017, where, the, aadhar, was, challenged, the, indian, supreme, court, declared, privacy, as, a, human, right, but, postponed, the, decision, regarding, the, constitutionality, of, aadhaar, for, another, bench, in, september, 2018, the, indian, supreme, court, determined, that, the, aadhaar, project, did, not, violate, the, legal, right, to, privacy, in, the, united, kingdom, it, is, not, possible, to, bring, an, action, for, invasion, of, privacy, an, action, may, be, brought, under, another, tort, usually, breach, of, confidence, and, privacy, must, then, be, considered, under, ec, law, in, the, uk, it, is, sometimes, a, defence, that, disclosure, of, private, information, was, in, the, public, interest, there, is, however, the, information, commissioner, s, office, ico, an, independent, public, body, set, up, to, promote, access, to, official, information, and, protect, personal, information, they, do, this, by, promoting, good, practice, ruling, on, eligible, complaints, giving, information, to, individuals, and, organisations, and, taking, action, when, the, law, is, broken, the, relevant, uk, laws, include, data, protection, act, 1998, freedom, of, information, act, 2000, environmental, information, regulations, 2004, privacy, and, electronic, communications, regulations, 2003, the, ico, has, also, provided, a, personal, information, toolkit, online, which, explains, in, more, detail, the, various, ways, of, protecting, privacy, online, in, the, united, states, more, systematic, treatises, of, privacy, did, not, appear, until, the, 1890s, with, the, development, of, privacy, law, in, america, although, the, us, constitution, does, not, explicitly, include, the, right, to, privacy, individual, as, well, as, locational, privacy, may, be, implicitly, granted, by, the, constitution, under, the, 4th, amendment, the, supreme, court, of, the, united, states, has, found, that, other, guarantees, have, penumbras, that, implicitly, grant, a, right, to, privacy, against, government, intrusion, for, example, in, griswold, v, connecticut, and, roe, v, wade, dobbs, v, jackson, women, s, health, organization, later, overruled, roe, v, wade, with, supreme, court, justice, clarence, thomas, characterizing, griswold, s, penumbral, argument, as, having, a, facial, absurdity, casting, doubt, on, the, validity, of, a, constitutional, right, to, privacy, in, the, united, states, and, of, previous, decisions, relying, on, it, in, the, united, states, the, right, of, freedom, of, speech, granted, in, the, first, amendment, has, limited, the, effects, of, lawsuits, for, breach, of, privacy, privacy, is, regulated, in, the, us, by, the, privacy, act, of, 1974, and, various, state, laws, the, privacy, act, of, 1974, only, applies, to, federal, agencies, in, the, executive, branch, of, the, federal, government, certain, privacy, rights, have, been, established, in, the, united, states, via, legislation, such, as, the, children, s, online, privacy, protection, act, coppa, the, gramm, leach, bliley, act, glb, and, the, health, insurance, portability, and, accountability, act, hipaa, unlike, the, eu, and, most, eu, member, states, the, us, does, not, recognize, the, right, to, privacy, of, non, us, citizens, the, un, s, special, rapporteur, on, the, right, to, privacy, joseph, a, cannataci, criticized, this, distinction, the, theory, of, contextual, integrity, developed, by, helen, nissenbaum, defines, privacy, as, an, appropriate, information, flow, where, appropriateness, in, turn, is, defined, as, conformance, with, legitimate, informational, norms, specific, to, social, contexts, in, 1890, the, united, states, jurists, samuel, d, warren, and, louis, brandeis, wrote, the, right, to, privacy, an, article, in, which, they, argued, for, the, right, to, be, let, alone, using, that, phrase, as, a, definition, of, privacy, this, concept, relies, on, the, theory, of, natural, rights, and, focuses, on, protecting, individuals, the, citation, was, a, response, to, recent, technological, developments, such, as, photography, and, sensationalist, journalism, also, known, as, yellow, journalism, there, is, extensive, commentary, over, the, meaning, of, being, let, alone, and, among, other, ways, it, has, been, interpreted, to, mean, the, right, of, a, person, to, choose, seclusion, from, the, attention, of, others, if, they, wish, to, do, so, and, the, right, to, be, immune, from, scrutiny, or, being, observed, in, private, settings, such, as, one, s, own, home, although, this, early, vague, legal, concept, did, not, describe, privacy, in, a, way, that, made, it, easy, to, design, broad, legal, protections, of, privacy, it, strengthened, the, notion, of, privacy, rights, for, individuals, and, began, a, legacy, of, discussion, on, those, rights, in, the, us, limited, access, refers, to, a, person, s, ability, to, participate, in, society, without, having, other, individuals, and, organizations, collect, information, about, them, various, theorists, have, imagined, privacy, as, a, system, for, limiting, access, to, one, s, personal, information, edwin, lawrence, godkin, wrote, in, the, late, 19th, century, that, nothing, is, better, worthy, of, legal, protection, than, private, life, or, in, other, words, the, right, of, every, man, to, keep, his, affairs, to, himself, and, to, decide, for, himself, to, what, extent, they, shall, be, the, subject, of, public, observation, and, discussion, adopting, an, approach, similar, to, the, one, presented, by, ruth, gavison, nine, years, earlier, sissela, bok, said, that, privacy, is, the, condition, of, being, protected, from, unwanted, access, by, others, either, physical, access, personal, information, or, attention, control, over, one, s, personal, information, is, the, concept, that, privacy, is, the, claim, of, individuals, groups, or, institutions, to, determine, for, themselves, when, how, and, to, what, extent, information, about, them, is, communicated, to, others, generally, a, person, who, has, consensually, formed, an, interpersonal, relationship, with, another, person, is, not, considered, protected, by, privacy, rights, with, respect, to, the, person, they, are, in, the, relationship, with, charles, fried, said, that, privacy, is, not, simply, an, absence, of, information, about, us, in, the, minds, of, others, rather, it, is, the, control, we, have, over, information, about, ourselves, nevertheless, in, the, era, of, big, data, control, over, information, is, under, pressure, alan, westin, defined, four, states, or, experiences, of, privacy, solitude, intimacy, anonymity, and, reserve, solitude, is, a, physical, separation, from, others, intimacy, is, a, close, relaxed, and, frank, relationship, between, two, or, more, individuals, that, results, from, the, seclusion, of, a, pair, or, small, group, of, individuals, anonymity, is, the, desire, of, individuals, for, times, of, public, privacy, lastly, reserve, is, the, creation, of, a, psychological, barrier, against, unwanted, intrusion, this, creation, of, a, psychological, barrier, requires, others, to, respect, an, individual, s, need, or, desire, to, restrict, communication, of, information, concerning, themself, in, addition, to, the, psychological, barrier, of, reserve, kirsty, hughes, identified, three, more, kinds, of, privacy, barriers, physical, behavioral, and, normative, physical, barriers, such, as, walls, and, doors, prevent, others, from, accessing, and, experiencing, the, individual, in, this, sense, accessing, an, individual, includes, accessing, personal, information, about, them, behavioral, barriers, communicate, to, others, verbally, through, language, or, non, verbally, through, personal, space, body, language, or, clothing, that, an, individual, does, not, want, the, other, person, to, access, or, experience, them, lastly, normative, barriers, such, as, laws, and, social, norms, restrain, others, from, attempting, to, access, or, experience, an, individual, psychologist, carl, a, johnson, has, identified, the, psychological, concept, of, personal, control, as, closely, tied, to, privacy, his, concept, was, developed, as, a, process, containing, four, stages, and, two, behavioural, outcome, relationships, with, one, s, outcomes, depending, on, situational, as, well, as, personal, factors, privacy, is, described, as, behaviors, falling, at, specific, locations, on, these, two, dimensions, johnson, examined, the, following, four, stages, to, categorize, where, people, exercise, personal, control, outcome, choice, control, is, the, selection, between, various, outcomes, behaviour, selection, control, is, the, selection, between, behavioural, strategies, to, apply, to, attain, selected, outcomes, outcome, effectance, describes, the, fulfillment, of, selected, behaviour, to, achieve, chosen, outcomes, outcome, realization, control, is, the, personal, interpretation, of, one, s, achieved, outcome, the, relationship, between, two, factors, primary, and, secondary, control, is, defined, as, the, two, dimensional, phenomenon, where, one, reaches, personal, control, primary, control, describes, behaviour, directly, causing, outcomes, while, secondary, control, is, behaviour, indirectly, causing, outcomes, johnson, explores, the, concept, that, privacy, is, a, behaviour, that, has, secondary, control, over, outcomes, lorenzo, magnani, expands, on, this, concept, by, highlighting, how, privacy, is, essential, in, maintaining, personal, control, over, one, s, identity, and, consciousness, he, argues, that, consciousness, is, partly, formed, by, external, representations, of, ourselves, such, as, narratives, and, data, which, are, stored, outside, the, body, however, much, of, our, consciousness, consists, of, internal, representations, that, remain, private, and, are, rarely, externalized, this, internal, privacy, which, magnani, refers, to, as, a, form, of, information, property, or, moral, capital, is, crucial, for, preserving, free, choice, and, personal, agency, according, to, magnani, when, too, much, of, our, identity, and, data, is, externalized, and, subjected, to, scrutiny, it, can, lead, to, a, loss, of, personal, control, dignity, and, responsibility, the, protection, of, privacy, therefore, safeguards, our, ability, to, develop, and, pursue, personal, projects, in, our, own, way, free, from, intrusive, external, forces, acknowledging, other, conceptions, of, privacy, while, arguing, that, the, fundamental, concern, of, privacy, is, behavior, selection, control, johnson, converses, with, other, interpretations, including, those, of, maxine, wolfe, and, robert, s, laufer, and, irwin, altman, he, clarifies, the, continuous, relationship, between, privacy, and, personal, control, where, outlined, behaviours, not, only, depend, on, privacy, but, the, conception, of, one, s, privacy, also, depends, on, his, defined, behavioural, outcome, relationships, privacy, is, sometimes, defined, as, an, option, to, have, secrecy, richard, posner, said, that, privacy, is, the, right, of, people, to, conceal, information, about, themselves, that, others, might, use, to, their, disadvantage, in, various, legal, contexts, when, privacy, is, described, as, secrecy, a, conclusion, is, reached, if, privacy, is, secrecy, then, rights, to, privacy, do, not, apply, for, any, information, which, is, already, publicly, disclosed, when, privacy, as, secrecy, is, discussed, it, is, usually, imagined, to, be, a, selective, kind, of, secrecy, in, which, individuals, keep, some, information, secret, and, private, while, they, choose, to, make, other, information, public, and, not, private, privacy, may, be, understood, as, a, necessary, precondition, for, the, development, and, preservation, of, personhood, jeffrey, reiman, defined, privacy, in, terms, of, a, recognition, of, one, s, ownership, of, their, physical, and, mental, reality, and, a, moral, right, to, self, determination, through, the, social, ritual, of, privacy, or, the, social, practice, of, respecting, an, individual, s, privacy, barriers, the, social, group, communicates, to, developing, children, that, they, have, exclusive, moral, rights, to, their, bodies, in, other, words, moral, ownership, of, their, body, this, entails, control, over, both, active, physical, and, cognitive, appropriation, the, former, being, control, over, one, s, movements, and, actions, and, the, latter, being, control, over, who, can, experience, one, s, physical, existence, and, when, alternatively, stanley, benn, defined, privacy, in, terms, of, a, recognition, of, oneself, as, a, subject, with, agency, as, an, individual, with, the, capacity, to, choose, privacy, is, required, to, exercise, choice, overt, observation, makes, the, individual, aware, of, himself, or, herself, as, an, object, with, a, determinate, character, and, limited, probabilities, covert, observation, on, the, other, hand, changes, the, conditions, in, which, the, individual, is, exercising, choice, without, his, or, her, knowledge, and, consent, in, addition, privacy, may, be, viewed, as, a, state, that, enables, autonomy, a, concept, closely, connected, to, that, of, personhood, according, to, joseph, kufer, an, autonomous, self, concept, entails, a, conception, of, oneself, as, a, purposeful, self, determining, responsible, agent, and, an, awareness, of, one, s, capacity, to, control, the, boundary, between, self, and, other, that, is, to, control, who, can, access, and, experience, him, or, her, and, to, what, extent, furthermore, others, must, acknowledge, and, respect, the, self, s, boundaries, in, other, words, they, must, respect, the, individual, s, privacy, the, studies, of, psychologists, such, as, jean, piaget, and, victor, tausk, show, that, as, children, learn, that, they, can, control, who, can, access, and, experience, them, and, to, what, extent, they, develop, an, autonomous, self, concept, in, addition, studies, of, adults, in, particular, institutions, such, as, erving, goffman, s, study, of, total, institutions, such, as, prisons, and, mental, institutions, suggest, that, systemic, and, routinized, deprivations, or, violations, of, privacy, deteriorate, one, s, sense, of, autonomy, over, time, privacy, may, be, understood, as, a, prerequisite, for, the, development, of, a, sense, of, self, identity, privacy, barriers, in, particular, are, instrumental, in, this, process, according, to, irwin, altman, such, barriers, define, and, limit, the, boundaries, of, the, self, and, thus, serve, to, help, define, this, control, primarily, entails, the, ability, to, regulate, contact, with, others, control, over, the, permeability, of, the, self, s, boundaries, enables, one, to, control, what, constitutes, the, self, and, thus, to, define, what, is, the, self, in, addition, privacy, may, be, seen, as, a, state, that, fosters, personal, growth, a, process, integral, to, the, development, of, self, identity, hyman, gross, suggested, that, without, privacy, solitude, anonymity, and, temporary, releases, from, social, roles, individuals, would, be, unable, to, freely, express, themselves, and, to, engage, in, self, discovery, and, self, criticism, such, self, discovery, and, self, criticism, contributes, to, one, s, understanding, of, oneself, and, shapes, one, s, sense, of, identity, in, a, way, analogous, to, how, the, personhood, theory, imagines, privacy, as, some, essential, part, of, being, an, individual, the, intimacy, theory, imagines, privacy, to, be, an, essential, part, of, the, way, that, humans, have, strengthened, or, intimate, relationships, with, other, humans, because, part, of, human, relationships, includes, individuals, volunteering, to, self, disclose, most, if, not, all, personal, information, this, is, one, area, in, which, privacy, does, not, apply, james, rachels, advanced, this, notion, by, writing, that, privacy, matters, because, there, is, a, close, connection, between, our, ability, to, control, who, has, access, to, us, and, to, information, about, us, and, our, ability, to, create, and, maintain, different, sorts, of, social, relationships, with, different, people, protecting, intimacy, is, at, the, core, of, the, concept, of, sexual, privacy, which, law, professor, danielle, citron, argues, should, be, protected, as, a, unique, form, of, privacy, physical, privacy, could, be, defined, as, preventing, intrusions, into, one, s, physical, space, or, solitude, an, example, of, the, legal, basis, for, the, right, to, physical, privacy, is, the, u, s, fourth, amendment, which, guarantees, the, right, of, the, people, to, be, secure, in, their, persons, houses, papers, and, effects, against, unreasonable, searches, and, seizures, physical, privacy, may, be, a, matter, of, cultural, sensitivity, personal, dignity, and, or, shyness, there, may, also, be, concerns, about, safety, if, for, example, one, is, wary, of, becoming, the, victim, of, crime, or, stalking, there, are, different, things, that, can, be, prevented, to, protect, one, s, physical, privacy, including, people, watching, even, through, recorded, images, one, s, intimate, behaviours, or, intimate, parts, and, unauthorized, access, to, one, s, personal, possessions, or, places, examples, of, possible, efforts, used, to, avoid, the, former, especially, for, modesty, reasons, are, clothes, walls, fences, privacy, screens, cathedral, glass, window, coverings, etc, government, agencies, corporations, groups, societies, and, other, organizations, may, desire, to, keep, their, activities, or, secrets, from, being, revealed, to, other, organizations, or, individuals, adopting, various, security, practices, and, controls, in, order, to, keep, private, information, confidential, organizations, may, seek, legal, protection, for, their, secrets, for, example, a, government, administration, may, be, able, to, invoke, executive, privilege, or, declare, certain, information, to, be, classified, or, a, corporation, might, attempt, to, protect, valuable, proprietary, information, as, trade, secrets, privacy, self, synchronization, is, a, hypothesized, mode, by, which, the, stakeholders, of, an, enterprise, privacy, program, spontaneously, contribute, collaboratively, to, the, program, s, maximum, success, the, stakeholders, may, be, customers, employees, managers, executives, suppliers, partners, or, investors, when, self, synchronization, is, reached, the, model, states, that, the, personal, interests, of, individuals, toward, their, privacy, is, in, balance, with, the, business, interests, of, enterprises, who, collect, and, use, the, personal, information, of, those, individuals, david, flaherty, believes, networked, computer, databases, pose, threats, to, privacy, he, develops, data, protection, as, an, aspect, of, privacy, which, involves, the, collection, use, and, dissemination, of, personal, information, this, concept, forms, the, foundation, for, fair, information, practices, used, by, governments, globally, flaherty, forwards, an, idea, of, privacy, as, information, control, ndividuals, want, to, be, left, alone, and, to, exercise, some, control, over, how, information, about, them, is, used, richard, posner, and, lawrence, lessig, focus, on, the, economic, aspects, of, personal, information, control, posner, criticizes, privacy, for, concealing, information, which, reduces, market, efficiency, for, posner, employment, is, selling, oneself, in, the, labour, market, which, he, believes, is, like, selling, a, product, any, defect, in, the, product, that, is, not, reported, is, fraud, for, lessig, privacy, breaches, online, can, be, regulated, through, code, and, law, lessig, claims, the, protection, of, privacy, would, be, stronger, if, people, conceived, of, the, right, as, a, property, right, and, that, individuals, should, be, able, to, control, information, about, themselves, there, have, been, attempts, to, establish, privacy, as, one, of, the, fundamental, human, rights, whose, social, value, is, an, essential, component, in, the, functioning, of, democratic, societies, priscilla, regan, believes, that, individual, concepts, of, privacy, have, failed, philosophically, and, in, policy, she, supports, a, social, value, of, privacy, with, three, dimensions, shared, perceptions, public, values, and, collective, components, shared, ideas, about, privacy, allows, freedom, of, conscience, and, diversity, in, thought, public, values, guarantee, democratic, participation, including, freedoms, of, speech, and, association, and, limits, government, power, collective, elements, describe, privacy, as, collective, good, that, cannot, be, divided, regan, s, goal, is, to, strengthen, privacy, claims, in, policy, making, if, we, did, recognize, the, collective, or, public, good, value, of, privacy, as, well, as, the, common, and, public, value, of, privacy, those, advocating, privacy, protections, would, have, a, stronger, basis, upon, which, to, argue, for, its, protection, leslie, regan, shade, argues, that, the, human, right, to, privacy, is, necessary, for, meaningful, democratic, participation, and, ensures, human, dignity, and, autonomy, privacy, depends, on, norms, for, how, information, is, distributed, and, if, this, is, appropriate, violations, of, privacy, depend, on, context, the, human, right, to, privacy, has, precedent, in, the, united, nations, declaration, of, human, rights, everyone, has, the, right, to, freedom, of, opinion, and, expression, this, right, includes, freedom, to, hold, opinions, without, interference, and, to, seek, receive, and, impart, information, and, ideas, through, any, media, and, regardless, of, frontiers, shade, believes, that, privacy, must, be, approached, from, a, people, centered, perspective, and, not, through, the, marketplace, dr, eliza, watt, westminster, law, school, university, of, westminster, in, london, uk, proposes, application, of, the, international, human, right, law, ihrl, concept, of, virtual, control, as, an, approach, to, deal, with, extraterritorial, mass, surveillance, by, state, intelligence, agencies, dr, watt, envisions, the, virtual, control, test, understood, as, a, remote, control, over, the, individual, s, right, to, privacy, of, communications, where, privacy, is, recognized, under, the, iccpr, article, 17, this, she, contends, may, help, to, close, the, normative, gap, that, is, being, exploited, by, nation, states, the, privacy, paradox, is, a, phenomenon, in, which, online, users, state, that, they, are, concerned, about, their, privacy, but, behave, as, if, they, were, not, while, this, term, was, coined, as, early, as, 1998, it, was, not, used, in, its, current, popular, sense, until, the, year, 2000, susan, b, barnes, similarly, used, the, term, privacy, paradox, to, refer, to, the, ambiguous, boundary, between, private, and, public, space, on, social, media, when, compared, to, adults, young, people, tend, to, disclose, more, information, on, social, media, however, this, does, not, mean, that, they, are, not, concerned, about, their, privacy, susan, b, barnes, gave, a, case, in, her, article, in, a, television, interview, about, facebook, a, student, addressed, her, concerns, about, disclosing, personal, information, online, however, when, the, reporter, asked, to, see, her, facebook, page, she, put, her, home, address, phone, numbers, and, pictures, of, her, young, son, on, the, page, the, privacy, paradox, has, been, studied, and, scripted, in, different, research, settings, several, studies, have, shown, this, inconsistency, between, privacy, attitudes, and, behavior, among, online, users, however, by, now, an, increasing, number, of, studies, have, also, shown, that, there, are, significant, and, at, times, large, correlations, between, privacy, concerns, and, information, sharing, behavior, which, speaks, against, the, privacy, paradox, a, meta, analysis, of, 166, studies, published, on, the, topic, reported, an, overall, small, but, significant, relation, between, privacy, concerns, and, informations, sharing, or, use, of, privacy, protection, measures, so, although, there, are, several, individual, instances, or, anecdotes, where, behavior, appear, paradoxical, on, average, privacy, concerns, and, privacy, behaviors, seem, to, be, related, and, several, findings, question, the, general, existence, of, the, privacy, paradox, however, the, relationship, between, concerns, and, behavior, is, likely, only, small, and, there, are, several, arguments, that, can, explain, why, that, is, the, case, according, to, the, attitude, behavior, gap, attitudes, and, behaviors, are, in, general, and, in, most, cases, not, closely, related, a, main, explanation, for, the, partial, mismatch, in, the, context, of, privacy, specifically, is, that, users, lack, awareness, of, the, risks, and, the, degree, of, protection, users, may, underestimate, the, harm, of, disclosing, information, online, on, the, other, hand, some, researchers, argue, that, the, mismatch, comes, from, lack, of, technology, literacy, and, from, the, design, of, sites, for, example, users, may, not, know, how, to, change, their, default, settings, even, though, they, care, about, their, privacy, psychologists, sonja, utz, and, nicole, c, kr, mer, particularly, pointed, out, that, the, privacy, paradox, can, occur, when, users, must, trade, off, between, their, privacy, concerns, and, impression, management, a, study, conducted, by, susanne, barth, and, menno, d, t, de, jo, demonstrates, that, decision, making, takes, place, on, an, irrational, level, especially, when, it, comes, to, mobile, computing, mobile, applications, in, particular, are, often, built, up, in, such, a, way, that, spurs, decision, making, that, is, fast, and, automatic, without, assessing, risk, factors, protection, measures, against, these, unconscious, mechanisms, are, often, difficult, to, access, while, downloading, and, installing, apps, even, with, mechanisms, in, place, to, protect, user, privacy, users, may, not, have, the, knowledge, or, experience, to, enable, these, mechanisms, users, of, mobile, applications, generally, have, very, little, knowledge, of, how, their, personal, data, are, used, when, they, decide, which, application, to, download, they, typically, are, not, able, to, effectively, interpret, the, information, provided, by, application, vendors, regarding, the, collection, and, use, of, personal, data, other, research, finds, that, this, lack, of, interpretability, means, users, are, much, more, likely, to, be, swayed, by, cost, functionality, design, ratings, reviews, and, number, of, downloads, than, requested, permissions, for, usage, of, their, personal, data, the, willingness, to, incur, a, privacy, risk, is, suspected, to, be, driven, by, a, complex, array, of, factors, including, risk, attitudes, personal, value, for, private, information, and, general, attitudes, to, privacy, which, are, typically, measured, using, surveys, one, experiment, aiming, to, determine, the, monetary, value, of, several, types, of, personal, information, indicated, relatively, low, evaluations, of, personal, information, despite, claims, that, ascertaining, the, value, of, data, requires, a, stock, market, for, personal, information, surveillance, capitalism, and, the, mass, surveillance, industry, regularly, place, price, tags, on, this, form, of, data, as, it, is, shared, between, corporations, and, governments, users, are, not, always, given, the, tools, to, live, up, to, their, professed, privacy, concerns, and, they, are, sometimes, willing, to, trade, private, information, for, convenience, functionality, or, financial, gain, even, when, the, gains, are, very, small, one, study, suggests, that, people, think, their, browser, history, is, worth, the, equivalent, of, a, cheap, meal, another, finds, that, attitudes, to, privacy, risk, do, not, appear, to, depend, on, whether, it, is, already, under, threat, or, not, the, methodology, of, user, empowerment, describes, how, to, provide, users, with, sufficient, context, to, make, privacy, informed, decisions, it, is, suggested, by, andr, a, belliger, and, david, j, krieger, that, the, privacy, paradox, should, not, be, considered, a, paradox, but, more, of, a, privacy, dilemma, for, services, that, cannot, exist, without, the, user, sharing, private, data, however, the, general, public, is, typically, not, given, the, choice, whether, to, share, private, data, or, not, making, it, difficult, to, verify, any, claim, that, a, service, truly, cannot, exist, without, sharing, private, data, the, privacy, calculus, model, posits, that, two, factors, determine, privacy, behavior, namely, privacy, concerns, or, perceived, risks, and, expected, benefits, by, now, the, privacy, calculus, has, been, supported, by, several, studies, as, with, other, conceptions, of, privacy, there, are, various, ways, to, discuss, what, kinds, of, processes, or, actions, remove, challenge, lessen, or, attack, privacy, in, 1960, legal, scholar, william, prosser, created, the, following, list, of, activities, which, can, be, remedied, with, privacy, protection, from, 2004, to, 2008, building, from, this, and, other, historical, precedents, daniel, j, solove, presented, another, classification, of, actions, which, are, harmful, to, privacy, including, collection, of, information, which, is, already, somewhat, public, processing, of, information, sharing, information, and, invading, personal, space, to, get, private, information, in, the, context, of, harming, privacy, information, collection, means, gathering, whatever, information, can, be, obtained, by, doing, something, to, obtain, it, examples, include, surveillance, and, interrogation, another, example, is, how, consumers, and, marketers, also, collect, information, in, the, business, context, through, facial, recognition, which, has, recently, caused, a, concern, for, things, such, as, privacy, there, is, currently, research, being, done, related, to, this, topic, companies, like, google, and, meta, collect, vast, amounts, of, personal, data, from, their, users, through, various, services, and, platforms, this, data, includes, browsing, habits, search, history, location, information, and, even, personal, communications, these, companies, then, analyze, and, aggregate, this, data, to, create, detailed, user, profiles, which, are, sold, to, advertisers, and, other, third, parties, this, practice, is, often, done, without, explicit, user, consent, leading, to, an, invasion, of, privacy, as, individuals, have, little, control, over, how, their, information, is, used, the, sale, of, personal, data, can, result, in, targeted, advertising, manipulation, and, even, potential, security, risks, as, sensitive, information, can, be, exploited, by, malicious, actors, this, commercial, exploitation, of, personal, data, undermines, user, trust, and, raises, significant, ethical, and, legal, concerns, regarding, data, protection, and, privacy, rights, it, can, happen, that, privacy, is, not, harmed, when, information, is, available, but, that, the, harm, can, come, when, that, information, is, collected, as, a, set, then, processed, together, in, such, a, way, that, the, collective, reporting, of, pieces, of, information, encroaches, on, privacy, actions, in, this, category, which, can, lessen, privacy, include, the, following, count, not, him, among, your, friends, who, will, retail, your, privacies, to, the, world, information, dissemination, is, an, attack, on, privacy, when, information, which, was, shared, in, confidence, is, shared, or, threatened, to, be, shared, in, a, way, that, harms, the, subject, of, the, information, there, are, various, examples, of, this, breach, of, confidentiality, is, when, one, entity, promises, to, keep, a, person, s, information, private, then, breaks, that, promise, disclosure, is, making, information, about, a, person, more, accessible, in, a, way, that, harms, the, subject, of, the, information, regardless, of, how, the, information, was, collected, or, the, intent, of, making, it, available, exposure, is, a, special, type, of, disclosure, in, which, the, information, disclosed, is, emotional, to, the, subject, or, taboo, to, share, such, as, revealing, their, private, life, experiences, their, nudity, or, perhaps, private, body, functions, increased, accessibility, means, advertising, the, availability, of, information, without, actually, distributing, it, as, in, the, case, of, doxing, blackmail, is, making, a, threat, to, share, information, perhaps, as, part, of, an, effort, to, coerce, someone, appropriation, is, an, attack, on, the, personhood, of, someone, and, can, include, using, the, value, of, someone, s, reputation, or, likeness, to, advance, interests, which, are, not, those, of, the, person, being, appropriated, distortion, is, the, creation, of, misleading, information, or, lies, about, a, person, invasion, of, privacy, a, subset, of, expectation, of, privacy, is, a, different, concept, from, the, collecting, aggregating, and, disseminating, information, because, those, three, are, a, misuse, of, available, data, whereas, invasion, is, an, attack, on, the, right, of, individuals, to, keep, personal, secrets, an, invasion, is, an, attack, in, which, information, whether, intended, to, be, public, or, not, is, captured, in, a, way, that, insults, the, personal, dignity, and, right, to, private, space, of, the, person, whose, data, is, taken, an, intrusion, is, any, unwanted, entry, into, a, person, s, private, personal, space, and, solitude, for, any, reason, regardless, of, whether, data, is, taken, during, that, breach, of, space, decisional, interference, is, when, an, entity, somehow, injects, itself, into, the, personal, decision, making, process, of, another, person, perhaps, to, influence, that, person, s, private, decisions, but, in, any, case, doing, so, in, a, way, that, disrupts, the, private, personal, thoughts, that, a, person, has, similarly, to, actions, which, reduce, privacy, there, are, multiple, angles, of, privacy, and, multiple, techniques, to, improve, them, to, varying, extents, when, actions, are, done, at, an, organizational, level, they, may, be, referred, to, as, cybersecurity, individuals, can, encrypt, e, mails, via, enabling, either, two, encryption, protocols, s, mime, which, is, built, into, companies, like, apple, or, outlook, and, thus, most, common, or, pgp, the, signal, messaging, app, which, encrypts, messages, so, that, only, the, recipient, can, read, the, message, is, notable, for, being, available, on, many, mobile, devices, and, implementing, a, form, of, perfect, forward, secrecy, signal, has, received, praise, from, whistleblower, edward, snowden, encryption, and, other, privacy, based, security, measures, are, also, used, in, some, cryptocurrencies, such, as, monero, and, zcash, anonymizing, proxies, or, anonymizing, networks, like, i2p, and, tor, can, be, used, to, prevent, internet, service, providers, isp, from, knowing, which, sites, one, visits, and, with, whom, one, communicates, by, hiding, ip, addresses, and, location, but, does, not, necessarily, protect, a, user, from, third, party, data, mining, anonymizing, proxies, are, built, into, a, user, s, device, in, comparison, to, a, virtual, private, network, vpn, where, users, must, download, software, using, a, vpn, hides, all, data, and, connections, that, are, exchanged, between, servers, and, a, user, s, computer, resulting, in, the, online, data, of, the, user, being, unshared, and, secure, providing, a, barrier, between, the, user, and, their, isp, and, is, especially, important, to, use, when, a, user, is, connected, to, public, wi, fi, however, users, should, understand, that, all, their, data, does, flow, through, the, vpn, s, servers, rather, than, the, isp, users, should, decide, for, themselves, if, they, wish, to, use, either, an, anonymizing, proxy, or, a, vpn, in, a, more, non, technical, sense, using, incognito, mode, or, private, browsing, mode, will, prevent, a, user, s, computer, from, saving, history, internet, files, and, cookies, but, the, isp, will, still, have, access, to, the, users, search, history, using, anonymous, search, engines, will, not, share, a, user, s, history, clicks, and, will, obstruct, ad, blockers, concrete, solutions, on, how, to, solve, paradoxical, behavior, still, do, not, exist, many, efforts, are, focused, on, processes, of, decision, making, like, restricting, data, access, permissions, during, application, installation, but, this, would, not, completely, bridge, the, gap, between, user, intention, and, behavior, susanne, barth, and, menno, d, t, de, jong, believe, that, for, users, to, make, more, conscious, decisions, on, privacy, matters, the, design, needs, to, be, more, user, oriented, in, a, social, sense, simply, limiting, the, amount, of, personal, information, that, users, posts, on, social, media, could, increase, their, security, which, in, turn, makes, it, harder, for, criminals, to, perform, identity, theft, moreover, creating, a, set, of, complex, passwords, and, using, two, factor, authentication, can, allow, users, to, be, less, susceptible, to, their, accounts, being, compromised, when, various, data, leaks, occur, furthermore, users, should, protect, their, digital, privacy, by, using, anti, virus, software, which, can, block, harmful, viruses, like, a, pop, up, scanning, for, personal, information, on, a, users, computer, although, there, are, laws, that, promote, the, protection, of, users, in, some, countries, like, the, u, s, there, is, no, federal, digital, privacy, law, and, privacy, settings, are, essentially, limited, by, the, state, of, current, enacted, privacy, laws, to, further, their, privacy, users, can, start, conversing, with, representatives, letting, representatives, know, that, privacy, is, a, main, concern, which, in, turn, increases, the, likelihood, of, further, privacy, laws, being, enacted, david, attenborough, a, biologist, and, natural, historian, affirmed, that, gorillas, value, their, privacy, while, discussing, a, brief, escape, by, a, gorilla, in, london, zoo, lack, of, privacy, in, public, spaces, caused, by, overcrowding, increases, health, issues, in, animals, including, heart, disease, and, high, blood, pressure, also, the, stress, from, overcrowding, is, connected, to, an, increase, in, infant, mortality, rates, and, maternal, stress, the, lack, of, privacy, that, comes, with, overcrowding, is, connected, to, other, issues, in, animals, which, causes, their, relationships, with, others, to, diminish, how, they, present, themselves, to, others, of, their, species, is, a, necessity, in, their, life, and, overcrowding, causes, the, relationships, to, become, disordered, for, example, david, attenborough, claims, that, the, gorilla, s, right, to, privacy, is, being, violated, when, they, are, looked, at, through, glass, enclosures, they, are, aware, that, they, are, being, looked, at, therefore, they, do, not, have, control, over, how, much, the, onlookers, can, see, of, them, gorillas, and, other, animals, may, be, in, the, enclosures, due, to, safety, reasons, however, attenborough, states, that, this, is, not, an, excuse, for, them, to, be, constantly, watched, by, unnecessary, eyes, also, animals, will, start, hiding, in, unobserved, spaces, animals, in, zoos, have, been, found, to, exhibit, harmful, or, different, behaviours, due, to, the, presence, of, visitors, watching, them
