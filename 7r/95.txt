that, has, to, be, repaid, later, credit, cards, are, one, of, the, most, widely, used, forms, of, payment, across, the, world, a, regular, credit, card, is, different, from, a, charge, card, which, requires, the, balance, to, be, repaid, in, full, each, month, or, at, the, end, of, each, statement, cycle, in, contrast, credit, cards, allow, consumers, to, build, a, continuing, balance, of, debt, subject, to, interest, being, charged, at, a, specific, rate, a, credit, card, also, differs, from, a, charge, card, in, that, a, credit, card, typically, involves, a, third, party, entity, that, pays, the, seller, and, is, reimbursed, by, the, buyer, whereas, a, charge, card, simply, defers, payment, by, the, buyer, until, a, later, date, a, credit, card, also, differs, from, a, debit, card, which, can, be, used, like, currency, by, the, owner, of, the, card, as, of, june, 2018, there, were, 7, 753, billion, credit, cards, in, the, world, in, 2020, there, were, 1, 09, billion, credit, cards, in, circulation, in, the, united, states, and, 72, 5, of, adults, 187, 3, million, in, the, country, had, at, least, one, credit, card, the, size, of, most, credit, cards, is, 85, 60, by, 53, 98, millimetres, 3, 3, 8, in, 2, 1, 8, in, and, rounded, corners, with, a, radius, of, 2, 88, 3, 48, millimetres, 9, 80, 11, 80, in, conforming, to, the, iso, iec, 7810, id, 1, standard, the, same, size, as, atm, cards, and, other, payment, cards, such, as, debit, cards, most, credit, cards, are, made, of, plastic, but, some, are, made, from, metal, credit, cards, have, a, printed, or, embossed, bank, card, number, complying, with, the, iso, iec, 7812, numbering, standard, the, card, number, s, prefix, called, the, bank, identification, number, known, in, the, industry, as, a, bin, is, the, sequence, of, digits, at, the, beginning, of, the, number, that, determine, the, bank, to, which, a, credit, card, number, belongs, this, is, the, first, six, digits, for, mastercard, and, visa, cards, the, next, nine, digits, are, the, individual, account, number, and, the, final, digit, is, a, validity, check, digit, both, of, these, standards, are, maintained, and, further, developed, by, iso, iec, jtc, 1, sc, 17, wg, 1, credit, cards, have, a, magnetic, stripe, conforming, to, the, iso, iec, 7813, most, modern, credit, cards, use, smart, card, technology, they, have, a, computer, chip, embedded, in, them, as, a, security, feature, in, addition, complex, smart, cards, including, peripherals, such, as, a, keypad, a, display, or, a, fingerprint, sensor, are, increasingly, used, for, credit, cards, in, addition, to, the, main, credit, card, number, credit, cards, also, carry, issue, and, expiration, dates, given, to, the, nearest, month, as, well, as, extra, codes, such, as, issue, numbers, and, security, codes, complex, smart, cards, allow, to, have, a, variable, security, code, thus, increasing, security, for, online, transactions, not, all, credit, cards, have, the, same, sets, of, extra, codes, nor, do, they, use, the, same, number, of, digits, credit, card, numbers, and, cardholder, names, were, originally, embossed, to, allow, for, easy, transfer, of, such, information, to, charge, slips, printed, on, carbon, paper, forms, with, the, decline, of, paper, slips, some, credit, cards, are, no, longer, embossed, and, in, fact, the, card, number, is, no, longer, in, the, front, in, addition, some, cards, are, now, vertical, in, design, rather, than, horizontal, the, concept, of, using, a, card, for, purchases, was, described, in, 1887, by, edward, bellamy, in, his, utopian, novel, looking, backward, bellamy, used, the, term, credit, card, eleven, times, in, this, novel, although, this, referred, to, a, card, for, spending, a, guaranteed, minimum, income, rather, than, borrowing, making, it, more, similar, to, a, debit, card, beginning, in, the, late, 19th, century, charge, cards, came, in, various, shapes, and, sizes, made, of, celluloid, an, early, type, of, plastic, copper, aluminum, steel, and, other, types, of, whitish, metals, some, were, shaped, like, coins, with, a, little, hole, enabling, it, to, be, put, in, a, key, ring, these, charge, coins, were, usually, given, to, customers, who, had, charge, accounts, in, hotels, or, department, stores, each, had, a, charge, account, number, along, with, the, merchant, s, name, and, logo, the, charge, coin, offered, a, simple, and, fast, way, to, copy, a, charge, account, number, to, the, sales, slip, by, imprinting, the, coin, onto, the, sales, slip, the, charga, plate, developed, in, 1928, was, an, early, predecessor, of, the, credit, card, and, was, used, in, the, u, s, from, the, 1930s, to, the, late, 1950s, it, was, a, 2, 1, 2, by, 1, 1, 4, inch, 64, mm, 32, mm, rectangle, of, sheet, metal, related, to, addressograph, and, military, dog, tag, systems, it, was, embossed, with, the, customer, s, name, city, and, state, it, held, a, small, paper, card, on, its, back, for, a, signature, in, recording, a, purchase, the, plate, was, laid, into, a, recess, in, the, imprinter, with, a, paper, charge, slip, positioned, on, top, of, it, the, record, of, the, transaction, included, an, impression, of, the, embossed, information, made, by, the, imprinter, pressing, an, inked, ribbon, against, the, charge, slip, charga, plate, was, a, trademark, of, farrington, manufacturing, co, charga, plates, were, issued, by, large, scale, merchants, to, their, regular, customers, much, like, department, store, credit, cards, of, today, in, some, cases, the, plates, were, kept, in, the, issuing, store, rather, than, held, by, customers, when, an, authorized, user, made, a, purchase, a, clerk, retrieved, the, plate, from, the, store, s, files, and, then, processed, the, purchase, charga, plates, sped, up, back, office, bookkeeping, and, reduced, copying, errors, that, were, done, manually, in, paper, ledgers, in, each, store, in, 1934, american, airlines, and, the, air, transport, association, simplified, the, process, even, more, with, the, advent, of, the, air, travel, card, they, created, a, numbering, scheme, that, identified, the, issuer, of, the, card, as, well, as, the, customer, account, this, is, the, reason, the, modern, uatp, cards, still, start, with, the, number, 1, with, an, air, travel, card, passengers, could, buy, now, and, pay, later, for, a, ticket, against, their, credit, and, receive, a, fifteen, percent, discount, at, any, of, the, accepting, airlines, by, the, 1940s, all, of, the, major, u, s, airlines, offered, air, travel, cards, that, could, be, used, on, 17, different, airlines, by, 1941, about, half, of, the, airlines, revenues, came, through, the, air, travel, card, agreement, the, airlines, had, also, started, offering, installment, plans, to, lure, new, travellers, into, the, air, in, 1948, the, air, travel, card, became, the, first, internationally, valid, charge, card, within, all, members, of, the, international, air, transport, association, the, concept, of, customers, paying, different, merchants, using, the, same, card, was, expanded, in, 1950, by, ralph, schneider, and, frank, mcnamara, founders, of, diners, club, to, consolidate, multiple, cards, the, diners, club, which, was, created, partially, through, a, merger, with, dine, and, sign, produced, the, first, general, purpose, charge, card, and, required, the, entire, bill, to, be, paid, with, each, statement, that, was, followed, by, carte, blanche, and, in, 1958, by, american, express, which, created, a, worldwide, credit, card, network, although, these, were, initially, charge, cards, that, later, acquired, credit, card, features, until, 1958, no, one, had, been, able, to, successfully, establish, a, revolving, credit, financial, system, in, which, a, card, issued, by, a, third, party, bank, was, being, generally, accepted, by, a, large, number, of, merchants, as, opposed, to, merchant, issued, revolving, cards, accepted, by, only, a, few, merchants, there, had, been, a, dozen, attempts, by, small, american, banks, but, none, of, them, were, able, to, last, very, long, in, 1958, bank, of, america, launched, the, bankamericard, in, fresno, california, which, would, become, the, first, successful, recognizably, modern, credit, card, this, card, succeeded, where, others, failed, by, breaking, the, chicken, and, egg, cycle, in, which, consumers, did, not, want, to, use, a, card, that, few, merchants, would, accept, and, merchants, did, not, want, to, accept, a, card, that, few, consumers, used, bank, of, america, chose, fresno, because, 45, of, its, residents, used, the, bank, and, by, sending, a, card, to, 60, 000, fresno, residents, at, once, the, bank, was, able, to, convince, merchants, to, accept, the, card, it, was, eventually, licensed, to, other, banks, around, the, united, states, and, then, around, the, world, and, in, 1976, all, bankamericard, licensees, united, themselves, under, the, common, brand, visa, in, 1966, the, ancestor, of, mastercard, was, born, when, a, group, of, banks, established, master, charge, to, compete, with, bankamericard, it, received, a, significant, boost, when, citibank, merged, its, own, everything, card, launched, in, 1967, into, master, charge, in, 1969, early, credit, cards, in, the, u, s, of, which, bankamericard, was, the, most, prominent, example, were, mass, produced, and, mass, mailed, unsolicited, to, bank, customers, who, were, thought, to, be, low, risk, according, to, life, cards, were, mailed, off, to, unemployable, people, drunks, narcotics, addicts, and, to, compulsive, debtors, which, betty, furness, president, johnson, s, special, assistant, compared, to, giving, sugar, to, diabetics, these, mass, mailings, were, known, as, drops, in, banking, terminology, and, were, outlawed, in, 1970, due, to, the, financial, chaos, they, caused, however, by, the, time, the, law, came, into, effect, approximately, 100, million, credit, cards, had, been, dropped, into, the, u, s, population, after, 1970, only, credit, card, applications, could, be, sent, unsolicited, in, mass, mailings, this, system, was, computerized, in, 1973, under, the, leadership, of, dee, hock, the, first, ceo, of, visa, allowing, reduced, transaction, time, however, until, always, connected, payment, terminals, became, ubiquitous, at, the, beginning, of, the, 21st, century, it, was, common, for, a, merchant, to, accept, a, charge, especially, below, a, threshold, value, or, from, a, known, and, trusted, customer, without, verifying, it, by, phone, books, with, lists, of, stolen, card, numbers, were, distributed, to, merchants, who, were, supposed, in, any, case, to, check, cards, against, the, list, before, accepting, them, as, well, as, verifying, the, signature, on, the, charge, slip, against, that, on, the, card, merchants, who, failed, to, take, the, time, to, follow, the, proper, verification, procedures, were, liable, for, fraudulent, charges, but, because, of, the, cumbersome, nature, of, the, procedures, merchants, would, often, simply, skip, some, or, all, of, them, and, assume, the, risk, for, smaller, transactions, the, fragmented, nature, of, the, u, s, banking, system, regulation, under, the, glass, steagall, act, meant, that, credit, cards, became, an, effective, way, for, those, who, were, travelling, around, the, country, to, move, their, credit, to, places, where, they, could, not, directly, use, their, banking, facilities, there, are, now, countless, variations, on, the, basic, concept, of, revolving, credit, for, individuals, as, issued, by, banks, and, honored, by, a, network, of, financial, institutions, including, organization, branded, credit, cards, corporate, user, credit, cards, and, store, cards, in, 1966, barclaycard, in, the, united, kingdom, launched, the, first, credit, card, outside, the, united, states, although, credit, cards, reached, very, high, adoption, levels, in, the, u, s, canada, the, u, k, australia, and, new, zealand, during, the, latter, 20th, century, many, cultures, were, more, cash, oriented, or, developed, alternative, forms, of, cashless, payments, such, as, carte, bleue, or, the, eurocard, germany, france, switzerland, and, others, in, these, places, the, adoption, of, credit, cards, was, initially, much, slower, due, to, strict, regulations, regarding, bank, overdrafts, some, countries, france, in, particular, were, much, quicker, to, develop, and, adopt, chip, based, credit, cards, which, are, seen, as, major, anti, fraud, credit, devices, debit, cards, online, banking, atms, mobile, banking, and, installment, plans, are, used, more, widely, than, credit, cards, in, some, countries, it, took, until, the, 1990s, to, reach, anything, like, the, percentage, market, penetration, levels, achieved, in, the, u, s, canada, and, u, k, in, some, countries, acceptance, still, remains, low, as, the, use, of, a, credit, card, system, depends, on, the, banking, system, of, each, country, while, in, others, a, country, sometimes, had, to, develop, its, own, credit, card, network, e, g, u, k, s, barclaycard, and, australia, s, bankcard, japan, remains, a, very, cash, oriented, society, with, credit, card, adoption, being, limited, mainly, to, the, largest, of, merchants, although, stored, value, cards, such, as, telephone, cards, are, used, as, alternative, currencies, the, trend, is, toward, rfid, based, systems, inside, cards, cellphones, and, other, objects, the, design, of, the, credit, card, itself, has, become, a, major, selling, point, in, recent, years, a, growing, field, of, numismatics, study, of, money, or, more, specifically, exonumia, study, of, money, like, objects, credit, card, collectors, seek, to, collect, various, embodiments, of, credit, from, the, now, familiar, plastic, cards, to, older, paper, merchant, cards, and, even, metal, tokens, that, were, accepted, as, merchant, credit, cards, early, credit, cards, were, made, of, celluloid, plastic, then, metal, and, fiber, then, paper, and, are, now, mostly, polyvinyl, chloride, pvc, plastic, however, the, chip, part, of, credit, cards, is, made, from, metals, a, cash, advance, is, a, credit, card, transaction, that, withdraws, cash, rather, than, purchasing, something, the, process, can, take, place, either, through, an, atm, or, over, the, counter, at, a, bank, or, other, financial, agency, up, to, a, certain, limit, for, a, credit, card, this, will, be, the, credit, limit, or, some, percentage, of, it, cash, advances, often, incur, a, fee, of, 3, to, 5, percent, of, the, amount, being, borrowed, when, made, on, a, credit, card, the, interest, is, often, higher, than, other, credit, card, transactions, the, interest, compounds, daily, starting, from, the, day, cash, is, borrowed, some, purchases, made, with, a, credit, card, of, items, that, are, viewed, as, cash, are, also, considered, to, be, cash, advances, in, accordance, with, the, credit, card, network, s, guidelines, thereby, incurring, the, higher, interest, rate, and, the, lack, of, the, grace, period, these, often, include, money, orders, prepaid, debit, cards, lottery, tickets, gaming, chips, mobile, payments, and, certain, taxes, and, fees, paid, to, certain, governments, however, should, the, merchant, not, disclose, the, actual, nature, of, the, transactions, these, will, be, processed, as, regular, credit, card, transactions, many, merchants, have, passed, on, the, credit, card, processing, fees, to, the, credit, card, holders, in, spite, of, the, credit, card, network, s, guidelines, which, state, the, credit, card, holders, should, not, have, any, extra, fee, for, doing, a, transaction, with, a, credit, card, under, card, scheme, rules, a, credit, card, holder, presenting, an, accepted, form, of, identification, must, be, issued, a, cash, advance, over, the, counter, at, any, bank, which, issues, that, type, of, credit, card, even, if, the, cardholder, cannot, give, their, pin, a, japanese, law, enabling, credit, card, cash, back, came, into, force, in, 2010, however, a, legal, loophole, in, this, system, was, quickly, exploited, by, online, shops, dedicated, to, providing, cash, back, as, a, form, of, easy, loan, with, exorbitant, rates, at, first, the, online, store, sells, a, single, inexpensive, item, of, glass, marble, golf, tee, or, eraser, with, an, 80, 000, yen, wire, transfer, for, a, 100, 000, yen, 1, 200, us, dollar, credit, card, payment, a, month, later, when, the, credit, card, provider, charges, the, card, owner, with, the, full, fee, the, online, store, is, out, of, the, picture, with, no, liability, in, effect, what, the, online, cash, back, services, provide, are, loans, with, a, 300, annual, interest, rate, on, 19, october, 2010, hideki, fukuba, became, the, first, operator, of, such, an, online, cash, back, service, to, be, charged, by, the, police, he, was, charged, on, tax, evasion, of, 40, million, yen, in, unpaid, taxes, a, credit, card, issuing, company, such, as, a, bank, or, credit, union, enters, into, agreements, with, merchants, for, them, to, accept, their, credit, cards, merchants, often, advertise, in, signage, or, other, company, material, which, cards, they, accept, by, displaying, acceptance, marks, generally, derived, from, logos, alternatively, this, may, be, communicated, for, example, via, a, restaurant, s, menu, or, orally, or, stating, we, don, t, take, credit, cards, the, credit, card, issuer, issues, a, credit, card, to, a, customer, at, the, time, or, after, an, account, has, been, approved, by, the, credit, provider, which, need, not, be, the, same, entity, as, the, card, issuer, the, cardholders, can, then, use, it, to, make, purchases, at, merchants, accepting, that, card, when, a, purchase, is, made, the, cardholder, agrees, to, pay, the, card, issuer, the, cardholder, indicates, consent, to, pay, by, signing, a, receipt, with, a, record, of, the, card, details, and, indicating, the, amount, to, be, paid, or, by, entering, a, personal, identification, number, pin, also, many, merchants, now, accept, verbal, authorizations, via, telephone, and, electronic, authorization, using, the, internet, known, as, a, card, not, present, transaction, cnp, electronic, verification, systems, allow, merchants, to, verify, in, a, few, seconds, that, the, card, is, valid, and, the, cardholder, has, sufficient, credit, to, cover, the, purchase, allowing, the, verification, to, happen, at, time, of, purchase, the, verification, is, performed, using, a, credit, card, payment, terminal, or, point, of, sale, pos, system, with, a, communications, link, to, the, merchant, s, acquiring, bank, data, from, the, card, is, obtained, from, a, magnetic, stripe, or, chip, on, the, card, the, latter, system, is, called, chip, and, pin, in, the, united, kingdom, and, ireland, and, is, implemented, as, an, emv, card, for, card, not, present, transactions, where, the, card, is, not, shown, e, g, e, commerce, mail, order, and, telephone, sales, merchants, additionally, verify, that, the, customer, is, in, physical, possession, of, the, card, and, is, the, authorized, user, by, asking, for, additional, information, such, as, the, security, code, printed, on, the, back, of, the, card, date, of, expiry, and, billing, address, each, month, the, cardholder, is, sent, a, statement, indicating, the, purchases, made, with, the, card, any, outstanding, fees, the, total, amount, owed, and, the, minimum, payment, due, in, the, u, s, after, receiving, the, statement, the, cardholder, may, dispute, any, charges, that, are, thought, to, be, incorrect, see, 15, u, s, c, 1643, which, limits, cardholder, liability, for, unauthorized, use, of, a, credit, card, to, 50, the, fair, credit, billing, act, gives, details, of, the, u, s, regulations, many, banks, now, also, offer, the, option, of, electronic, statements, either, in, lieu, of, or, in, addition, to, physical, statements, which, can, be, viewed, at, any, time, by, the, cardholder, via, the, issuer, s, online, banking, website, notification, of, the, availability, of, a, new, statement, is, generally, sent, to, the, cardholder, s, email, address, if, the, card, issuer, has, chosen, to, allow, it, the, cardholder, may, have, other, options, for, payment, besides, a, physical, check, such, as, an, electronic, transfer, of, funds, from, a, checking, account, depending, on, the, issuer, the, cardholder, may, also, be, able, to, make, multiple, payments, during, a, single, statement, period, possibly, enabling, him, or, her, to, utilize, the, credit, limit, on, the, card, several, times, the, cardholder, must, pay, a, defined, minimum, portion, of, the, amount, owed, by, a, due, date, or, may, choose, to, pay, a, higher, amount, the, credit, issuer, charges, interest, on, the, unpaid, balance, if, the, billed, amount, is, not, paid, in, full, typically, at, a, much, higher, rate, than, most, other, forms, of, debt, this, impact, accounts, for, roughly, 8, of, all, interest, ever, paid, thus, hiding, the, minimum, payment, option, for, automatic, and, manual, payments, and, focusing, on, the, total, debt, may, mitigate, the, unwanted, consequences, of, default, minimum, payments, in, addition, if, the, cardholder, fails, to, make, at, least, the, minimum, payment, by, the, due, date, the, issuer, may, impose, a, late, fee, or, other, penalties, to, help, mitigate, this, some, financial, institutions, can, arrange, for, automatic, payments, to, be, deducted, from, the, cardholder, s, bank, account, thus, avoiding, such, penalties, altogether, as, long, as, the, cardholder, has, sufficient, funds, in, cases, where, the, minimum, payment, is, less, than, the, finance, charges, and, fees, assessed, during, the, billing, cycle, the, outstanding, balance, will, increase, in, what, is, called, negative, amortization, this, practice, tends, to, increase, credit, risk, and, mask, the, lender, s, portfolio, quality, and, consequently, has, been, banned, in, the, u, s, since, 2003, credit, card, advertising, regulations, in, the, u, s, include, the, schumer, box, disclosure, requirements, a, large, fraction, of, junk, mail, consists, of, the, credit, card, offers, created, from, lists, provided, by, the, major, credit, reporting, agencies, in, the, united, states, the, three, major, u, s, credit, bureaus, equifax, transunion, and, experian, allow, consumers, to, opt, out, from, related, credit, card, solicitation, offers, via, its, opt, out, pre, screen, program, credit, card, issuers, usually, waive, interest, charges, if, the, balance, is, paid, in, full, each, month, but, typically, will, charge, full, interest, on, the, entire, outstanding, balance, from, the, date, of, each, purchase, if, the, total, balance, is, not, paid, for, example, if, a, user, had, a, 1, 000, transaction, and, repaid, it, in, full, within, this, grace, period, there, would, be, no, interest, charged, if, however, even, 1, 00, of, the, total, amount, remained, unpaid, interest, would, be, charged, on, the, 1, 000, from, the, date, of, purchase, until, the, payment, is, received, the, precise, manner, in, which, interest, is, charged, is, usually, detailed, in, a, cardholder, agreement, which, may, be, summarized, on, the, back, of, the, monthly, statement, the, general, calculation, formula, most, financial, institutions, use, to, determine, the, amount, of, interest, to, be, charged, is, apr, 100, x, adb, 365, x, number, of, days, revolved, take, the, annual, percentage, rate, apr, and, divide, by, 100, then, multiply, to, the, amount, of, the, average, daily, balance, adb, divide, the, result, by, 365, and, then, take, this, total, and, multiply, by, the, total, number, of, days, the, amount, revolved, before, payment, was, made, on, the, account, financial, institutions, refer, to, interest, charged, back, to, the, original, time, of, the, transaction, and, up, to, the, time, a, payment, was, made, if, not, in, full, as, a, residual, retail, finance, charge, rrfc, thus, after, an, amount, has, revolved, and, a, payment, has, been, made, the, user, of, the, card, will, still, receive, interest, charges, on, their, statement, after, paying, the, next, statement, in, full, in, fact, the, statement, may, only, have, a, charge, for, interest, that, collected, up, until, the, date, the, full, balance, was, paid, i, e, when, the, balance, stopped, revolving, the, credit, card, may, simply, serve, as, a, form, of, revolving, credit, or, it, may, become, a, complicated, financial, instrument, with, multiple, balance, segments, each, at, a, different, interest, rate, possibly, with, a, single, umbrella, credit, limit, or, with, separate, credit, limits, applicable, to, the, various, balance, segments, usually, this, compartmentalization, is, the, result, of, special, incentive, offers, from, the, issuing, bank, to, encourage, balance, transfers, from, cards, of, other, issuers, if, several, interest, rates, apply, to, various, balance, segments, then, payment, allocation, is, generally, at, the, discretion, of, the, issuing, bank, and, payments, will, therefore, usually, be, allocated, towards, the, lowest, rate, balances, until, paid, in, full, before, any, money, is, paid, towards, higher, rate, balances, interest, rates, can, vary, considerably, from, card, to, card, and, the, interest, rate, on, a, particular, card, may, jump, dramatically, if, the, card, user, is, late, with, a, payment, on, that, card, or, any, other, credit, instrument, or, even, if, the, issuing, bank, decides, to, raise, its, revenue, a, credit, card, s, grace, period, is, the, time, the, cardholder, has, to, pay, the, balance, before, interest, is, assessed, on, the, outstanding, balance, grace, periods, may, vary, but, usually, range, from, 20, to, 55, days, depending, on, the, type, of, credit, card, and, the, issuing, bank, some, policies, allow, for, reinstatement, after, certain, conditions, are, met, usually, if, a, cardholder, is, late, paying, the, balance, finance, charges, will, be, calculated, and, the, grace, period, does, not, apply, finance, charges, incurred, depend, on, the, grace, period, and, balance, with, most, credit, cards, there, is, no, grace, period, if, there, is, any, outstanding, balance, from, the, previous, billing, cycle, or, statement, i, e, interest, is, applied, on, both, the, previous, balance, and, new, transactions, however, there, are, some, credit, cards, that, will, only, apply, finance, charges, on, the, previous, or, old, balance, excluding, new, transactions, the, flow, of, information, and, money, between, these, parties, always, through, the, card, associations, is, known, as, the, interchange, and, it, consists, of, a, few, steps, a, credit, card, register, is, a, transaction, register, used, to, ensure, the, increasing, balance, owed, from, using, a, credit, card, is, enough, below, the, credit, limit, to, deal, with, authorization, holds, and, payments, not, yet, received, by, the, bank, and, to, easily, look, up, past, transactions, for, reconciliation, and, budgeting, the, register, is, a, personal, record, of, banking, transactions, used, for, credit, card, purchases, as, they, affect, funds, in, the, bank, account, or, the, available, credit, in, addition, to, checking, numbers, and, so, forth, the, code, column, indicates, the, credit, card, the, balance, column, shows, available, funds, after, purchases, when, the, credit, card, payment, is, made, the, balance, already, reflects, the, funds, were, spent, in, a, credit, card, s, entry, the, deposit, column, shows, the, available, credit, and, the, payment, column, shows, the, total, owed, their, sum, being, equal, to, the, credit, limit, each, check, is, written, debit, card, transaction, cash, withdrawal, and, credit, card, charge, are, entered, manually, into, the, paper, register, daily, or, several, times, per, week, credit, card, register, also, refers, to, one, transaction, record, for, each, credit, card, in, this, case, the, booklets, readily, enable, the, location, of, a, card, s, current, available, credit, when, ten, or, more, cards, are, in, use, business, credit, cards, are, specialized, credit, cards, issued, in, the, name, of, a, registered, business, and, typically, they, can, only, be, used, for, business, purposes, their, use, has, grown, in, recent, decades, in, 1998, for, instance, 37, of, small, businesses, reported, using, a, business, credit, card, by, 2009, this, number, had, grown, to, 64, business, credit, cards, offer, a, number, of, features, specific, to, businesses, they, frequently, offer, special, rewards, in, areas, such, as, shipping, office, supplies, travel, and, business, technology, most, issuers, use, the, applicant, s, personal, credit, score, when, evaluating, these, applications, in, addition, income, from, a, variety, of, sources, may, be, used, to, qualify, which, means, these, cards, may, be, available, to, businesses, that, are, newly, established, in, addition, some, issuers, of, this, card, do, not, report, account, activity, to, the, owner, s, personal, credit, or, only, do, so, if, the, account, is, delinquent, in, these, cases, the, activity, of, the, business, is, separated, from, the, owner, s, personal, credit, activity, business, credit, cards, are, offered, by, american, express, discover, and, almost, all, major, issuers, of, visa, and, mastercard, cards, some, local, banks, and, credit, unions, also, offer, business, credit, cards, american, express, is, the, only, major, issuer, of, business, charge, cards, in, the, united, states, however, a, secured, credit, card, is, a, type, of, credit, card, secured, by, a, deposit, account, owned, by, the, cardholder, typically, the, cardholder, must, deposit, between, 100, and, 200, of, the, total, amount, of, credit, desired, thus, if, the, cardholder, puts, down, 1, 000, they, will, be, given, credit, in, the, range, of, 500, 1, 000, in, some, cases, credit, card, issuers, will, offer, incentives, even, on, their, secured, card, portfolios, in, these, cases, the, deposit, required, may, be, significantly, less, than, the, required, credit, limit, and, can, be, as, low, as, 10, of, the, desired, credit, limit, this, deposit, is, held, in, a, special, savings, account, credit, card, issuers, offer, this, because, they, have, noticed, that, delinquencies, were, notably, reduced, when, the, customer, perceives, something, to, lose, if, the, balance, is, not, repaid, the, cardholder, of, a, secured, credit, card, is, still, expected, to, make, regular, payments, as, with, a, regular, credit, card, but, should, they, default, on, a, payment, the, card, issuer, has, the, option, of, recovering, the, cost, of, the, purchases, paid, to, the, merchants, out, of, the, deposit, the, advantage, of, the, secured, card, for, an, individual, with, negative, or, no, credit, history, is, that, most, companies, report, regularly, to, the, major, credit, bureaus, this, allows, the, cardholder, to, start, building, or, re, building, a, positive, credit, history, although, the, deposit, is, in, the, hands, of, the, credit, card, issuer, as, security, in, the, event, of, default, by, the, consumer, the, deposit, will, not, be, debited, simply, for, missing, one, or, two, payments, usually, the, deposit, is, only, used, as, an, offset, when, the, account, is, closed, either, at, the, request, of, the, customer, or, due, to, severe, delinquency, 150, to, 180, days, this, means, that, an, account, that, is, less, than, 150, days, delinquent, will, continue, to, accrue, interest, and, fees, and, could, result, in, a, balance, that, is, much, higher, than, the, actual, credit, limit, on, the, card, in, these, cases, the, total, debt, may, far, exceed, the, original, deposit, and, the, cardholder, not, only, forfeits, their, deposit, but, is, left, with, additional, debt, most, of, these, conditions, are, usually, described, in, a, cardholder, agreement, which, the, cardholder, signs, when, their, account, is, opened, secured, credit, cards, are, an, option, to, allow, a, person, with, a, poor, credit, history, or, no, credit, history, to, have, a, credit, card, that, might, not, otherwise, be, available, they, are, often, offered, as, a, means, of, rebuilding, one, s, credit, fees, and, service, charges, for, secured, credit, cards, often, exceed, those, charged, for, ordinary, non, secured, credit, cards, for, people, in, certain, situations, for, example, after, charging, off, on, other, credit, cards, or, people, with, a, long, history, of, delinquency, on, various, forms, of, debt, secured, cards, are, almost, always, more, expensive, than, unsecured, credit, cards, sometimes, a, credit, card, will, be, secured, by, the, equity, in, the, borrower, s, home, they, are, sometimes, called, prepaid, credit, card, but, they, are, a, debit, card, prepaid, card, or, prepaid, debit, card, since, no, credit, is, offered, by, the, card, issuer, the, cardholder, spends, money, which, has, been, stored, via, a, prior, deposit, by, the, cardholder, or, someone, else, such, as, a, parent, or, employer, however, it, carries, a, credit, card, brand, such, as, discover, visa, mastercard, american, express, or, jcb, and, can, be, used, in, similar, ways, just, as, though, it, were, a, credit, card, unlike, debit, cards, prepaid, credit, cards, generally, do, not, require, a, pin, an, exception, are, prepaid, credit, cards, with, an, emv, chip, these, cards, do, require, a, pin, if, the, payment, is, processed, via, chip, and, pin, technology, as, of, 2018, most, debit, cards, in, the, u, s, were, prepaid, cards, 71, 7, after, purchasing, the, card, the, cardholder, loads, the, account, with, any, amount, of, money, up, to, the, predetermined, card, limit, and, then, uses, the, card, to, make, purchases, the, same, way, as, a, typical, credit, card, prepaid, cards, can, be, issued, to, minors, above, 13, since, there, is, no, credit, line, involved, the, main, advantage, over, secured, credit, cards, see, above, section, is, that, the, cardholder, is, not, required, to, come, up, with, 500, or, more, to, open, an, account, with, prepaid, credit, cards, purchasers, are, not, charged, any, interest, but, are, often, charged, a, purchasing, fee, plus, monthly, fees, after, an, arbitrary, time, period, many, other, fees, also, usually, apply, to, a, prepaid, card, prepaid, credit, cards, are, sometimes, marketed, to, teenagers, for, shopping, online, without, having, their, parents, complete, the, transaction, teenagers, can, only, use, funds, that, are, available, on, the, card, which, helps, promote, financial, management, to, reduce, the, risk, of, debt, problems, later, in, life, prepaid, cards, can, be, used, globally, the, prepaid, card, is, convenient, for, payees, in, developing, countries, like, brazil, russia, india, and, china, where, international, wire, transfers, and, bank, checks, are, time, consuming, complicated, and, costly, because, of, the, many, fees, that, apply, to, obtaining, and, using, credit, card, branded, prepaid, cards, the, financial, consumer, agency, of, canada, describes, them, as, an, expensive, way, to, spend, your, own, money, the, agency, publishes, a, booklet, entitled, pre, paid, cards, which, explains, the, advantages, and, disadvantages, of, this, type, of, prepaid, card, see, further, reading, a, digital, card, is, a, digital, cloud, hosted, virtual, representation, of, any, kind, of, identification, card, or, payment, card, such, as, a, credit, card, the, charge, cards, are, a, type, of, credit, card, the, main, benefit, to, the, cardholder, is, convenience, compared, to, debit, cards, and, checks, a, credit, card, allows, small, short, term, loans, to, be, quickly, made, to, a, cardholder, who, need, not, calculate, a, balance, remaining, before, every, transaction, provided, the, total, charges, do, not, exceed, the, maximum, credit, line, for, the, card, one, financial, benefit, is, that, no, interest, is, charged, when, the, balance, is, paid, in, full, within, the, grace, period, in, the, united, states, most, credit, cards, offer, a, grace, period, ex, 21, 23, or, 25, days, on, purchase, transactions, different, countries, offer, different, levels, of, protection, in, the, u, k, for, example, the, bank, is, jointly, liable, with, the, merchant, for, purchases, of, defective, products, over, 100, many, credit, cards, offer, benefits, to, cardholders, some, benefits, apply, to, products, purchased, with, the, card, like, extended, product, warranties, reimbursement, for, decreases, in, price, immediately, after, purchase, price, protection, and, reimbursement, for, theft, or, damage, on, recently, purchased, products, purchase, protection, other, benefits, include, various, types, of, travel, insurance, such, as, rental, car, insurance, travel, accident, insurance, baggage, delay, insurance, and, trip, delay, or, cancellation, insurance, credit, cards, may, also, offer, a, loyalty, program, where, each, purchase, is, rewarded, based, on, the, price, of, the, purchase, typically, rewards, are, either, in, the, form, of, cashback, or, points, points, are, often, redeemable, for, gift, cards, products, or, travel, expenses, like, airline, tickets, some, credit, cards, allow, the, transfer, of, accrued, points, to, hotel, and, airline, loyalty, programs, research, has, examined, whether, competition, among, card, networks, may, potentially, make, payment, rewards, too, generous, causing, higher, prices, among, merchants, thus, actually, impacting, social, welfare, and, its, distribution, a, situation, potentially, warranting, public, policy, interventions, some, countries, such, as, the, united, states, the, united, kingdom, and, france, limit, the, amount, for, which, a, consumer, can, be, held, liable, in, the, event, of, fraudulent, transactions, with, a, lost, or, stolen, credit, card, the, table, below, contains, a, list, of, benefits, offered, in, the, united, states, for, consumer, credit, cards, in, some, of, these, networks, these, benefits, may, vary, with, each, credit, card, issuer, low, introductory, credit, card, rates, are, limited, to, a, fixed, term, usually, between, 6, and, 12, months, after, which, a, higher, rate, is, charged, as, all, credit, cards, charge, fees, and, interest, some, customers, become, so, indebted, to, their, credit, card, provider, that, they, are, driven, to, bankruptcy, some, credit, cards, often, levy, a, rate, of, 20, to, 30, percent, after, a, payment, is, missed, in, other, cases, a, fixed, charge, is, levied, without, change, to, the, interest, rate, in, some, cases, universal, default, may, apply, the, high, default, rate, is, applied, to, a, card, in, good, standing, by, missing, a, payment, on, an, unrelated, account, from, the, same, provider, this, can, lead, to, a, snowball, effect, in, which, the, consumer, is, drowned, by, unexpectedly, high, interest, rates, further, most, card, holder, agreements, enable, the, issuer, to, arbitrarily, raise, the, interest, rate, for, any, reason, they, see, fit, first, premier, bank, at, one, point, offered, a, credit, card, with, a, 79, 9, interest, rate, however, they, discontinued, this, card, in, february, 2011, because, of, persistent, defaults, research, shows, that, a, substantial, fraction, of, consumers, about, 40, percent, choose, a, sub, optimal, credit, card, agreement, with, some, incurring, hundreds, of, dollars, of, avoidable, interest, costs, credit, card, ownership, brings, additional, risks, with, it, compared, to, other, cashless, payment, alternatives, such, as, an, increased, risk, of, fraud, or, taking, on, unnecessary, liability, several, studies, have, shown, that, consumers, are, likely, to, spend, more, money, when, they, pay, by, credit, card, researchers, suggest, that, when, people, pay, using, credit, cards, they, do, not, experience, the, abstract, pain, of, payment, furthermore, researchers, have, found, that, using, credit, cards, can, increase, consumption, of, unhealthy, food, compared, to, using, cash, merchants, that, accept, credit, cards, must, pay, interchange, fees, and, discount, fees, on, all, credit, card, transactions, in, some, cases, merchants, are, barred, by, their, credit, agreements, from, passing, these, fees, directly, to, credit, card, customers, or, from, setting, a, minimum, transaction, amount, no, longer, prohibited, in, the, united, states, united, kingdom, or, australia, the, result, is, that, merchants, are, induced, to, charge, all, customers, including, those, who, do, not, use, credit, cards, higher, prices, to, cover, the, fees, on, credit, card, transactions, the, inducement, can, be, strong, because, the, merchant, s, fee, is, a, percentage, of, the, sale, price, which, has, a, disproportionate, effect, on, the, profitability, of, businesses, that, have, predominantly, credit, card, transactions, unless, compensated, for, by, raising, prices, generally, in, the, united, states, in, 2008, credit, card, companies, collected, a, total, of, 48, billion, in, interchange, fees, or, an, average, of, 427, per, family, with, an, average, fee, rate, of, about, 2, per, transaction, credit, card, rewards, result, in, a, total, transfer, of, 1, 282, from, the, average, cash, payer, to, the, average, card, payer, per, year, for, merchants, card, based, purchase, amounts, reduce, resistance, compared, to, paying, cash, and, the, transaction, is, often, more, secure, than, other, forms, of, payment, such, as, checks, because, the, issuing, bank, commits, to, pay, the, merchant, the, moment, the, transaction, is, authorized, regardless, of, whether, the, consumer, defaults, on, the, credit, card, payment, except, for, legitimate, disputes, which, can, result, in, charges, back, to, the, merchant, cards, are, even, more, secure, than, cash, because, they, reduce, theft, opportunities, by, reducing, the, amount, of, cash, on, the, premises, finally, credit, cards, reduce, the, back, office, expense, of, processing, checks, cash, and, transporting, them, to, the, bank, prior, to, credit, cards, each, merchant, had, to, evaluate, each, customer, s, credit, history, before, extending, credit, that, task, is, now, performed, by, the, banks, which, assume, the, credit, risk, extra, turnover, is, generated, by, the, fact, that, the, customer, can, purchase, goods, and, services, immediately, and, is, less, inhibited, by, the, amount, of, cash, in, pocket, and, the, immediate, state, of, the, customer, s, bank, balance, much, of, merchants, marketing, is, based, on, this, immediacy, for, each, purchase, the, bank, charges, the, merchant, a, commission, discount, fee, for, this, service, and, there, may, be, a, certain, delay, before, the, agreed, payment, is, received, by, the, merchant, the, commission, is, often, a, percentage, of, the, transaction, amount, plus, a, fixed, fee, interchange, rate, merchants, are, charged, several, fees, for, accepting, credit, cards, the, merchant, is, usually, charged, a, commission, of, around, 0, 5, to, 4, percent, of, the, value, of, each, transaction, paid, for, by, credit, card, the, merchant, may, also, pay, a, variable, charge, called, a, merchant, discount, rate, for, each, transaction, in, some, instances, of, very, low, value, transactions, use, of, credit, cards, will, significantly, reduce, the, profit, margin, or, cause, the, merchant, to, lose, money, on, the, transaction, merchants, with, very, low, average, transaction, prices, or, very, high, average, transaction, prices, are, more, averse, to, accepting, credit, cards, in, some, cases, merchants, may, charge, users, a, credit, card, supplement, or, surcharge, either, a, fixed, amount, or, a, percentage, for, payment, by, credit, card, this, practice, was, prohibited, by, most, credit, card, contracts, in, the, united, states, until, 2013, when, a, major, settlement, between, merchants, and, credit, card, companies, allowed, merchants, to, levy, surcharges, most, retailers, have, not, started, using, credit, card, surcharges, however, for, fear, of, losing, customers, merchants, in, the, united, states, have, been, fighting, what, they, consider, to, be, unfairly, high, fees, charged, by, credit, card, companies, in, a, series, of, lawsuits, that, started, in, 2005, merchants, charged, that, the, two, main, credit, card, processing, companies, mastercard, and, visa, used, their, monopoly, power, to, levy, excessive, fees, in, a, class, action, lawsuit, involving, the, national, retail, federation, and, major, retailers, such, as, wal, mart, in, december, 2013, a, federal, judge, approved, a, 5, 7, billion, settlement, in, the, case, that, offered, payouts, to, merchants, who, had, paid, credit, card, fees, the, largest, antitrust, settlement, in, u, s, history, some, large, retailers, such, as, wal, mart, and, amazon, chose, to, not, participate, in, this, settlement, however, and, have, continued, their, legal, fight, against, the, credit, card, companies, in, april, 2015, eu, imposed, a, cap, on, the, interchange, fee, to, 0, 3, on, consumer, credit, cards, and, 0, 2, on, debit, cards, merchants, are, also, required, to, lease, or, purchase, processing, equipment, in, some, cases, this, equipment, is, provided, free, of, charge, by, the, processor, merchants, must, also, satisfy, data, security, compliance, standards, which, are, highly, technical, and, complicated, in, many, cases, there, is, a, delay, of, several, days, before, funds, are, deposited, into, a, merchant, s, bank, account, because, credit, card, fee, structures, are, very, complicated, smaller, merchants, are, at, a, disadvantage, to, analyze, and, predict, fees, finally, merchants, assume, the, risk, of, chargebacks, by, consumers, credit, card, security, relies, on, the, physical, security, of, the, plastic, card, as, well, as, the, privacy, of, the, credit, card, number, therefore, whenever, a, person, other, than, the, card, owner, has, access, to, the, card, or, its, number, security, is, potentially, compromised, once, merchants, would, often, accept, credit, card, numbers, without, additional, verification, for, mail, order, purchases, it, is, now, common, practice, to, only, ship, to, confirmed, addresses, as, a, security, measure, to, minimize, fraudulent, purchases, some, merchants, will, accept, a, credit, card, number, for, in, store, purchases, whereupon, access, to, the, number, allows, easy, fraud, but, many, require, the, card, itself, to, be, present, and, require, a, signature, for, magnetic, stripe, cards, a, lost, or, stolen, card, can, be, cancelled, and, if, this, is, done, quickly, will, greatly, limit, the, fraud, that, can, take, place, in, this, way, european, banks, can, require, a, cardholder, s, security, pin, be, entered, for, in, person, purchases, with, the, card, the, payment, card, industry, data, security, standard, pci, dss, is, the, security, standard, issued, by, the, payment, card, industry, security, standards, council, pci, ssc, this, data, security, standard, is, used, by, acquiring, banks, to, impose, cardholder, data, security, measures, upon, their, merchants, the, goal, of, the, credit, card, companies, is, not, to, eliminate, fraud, but, to, reduce, it, to, manageable, levels, this, implies, that, fraud, prevention, measures, will, be, used, only, if, their, cost, is, lower, than, the, potential, gains, from, fraud, reduction, whereas, high, cost, low, return, measures, will, not, be, used, as, would, be, expected, from, organizations, whose, goal, is, profit, maximization, internet, fraud, may, be, committed, by, claiming, a, chargeback, which, is, not, justified, friendly, fraud, or, carried, out, by, the, use, of, credit, card, information, which, can, be, stolen, in, many, ways, the, simplest, being, copying, information, from, retailers, either, online, or, offline, despite, efforts, to, improve, security, for, remote, purchases, using, credit, cards, security, breaches, are, usually, the, result, of, poor, practice, by, merchants, for, example, a, website, that, safely, uses, tls, to, encrypt, card, data, from, a, client, may, then, email, the, data, unencrypted, from, the, webserver, to, the, merchant, or, the, merchant, may, store, unencrypted, details, in, a, way, that, allows, them, to, be, accessed, over, the, internet, or, by, a, rogue, employee, unencrypted, card, details, are, always, a, security, risk, even, encrypted, data, may, be, cracked, controlled, payment, numbers, also, known, as, virtual, credit, cards, or, disposable, credit, cards, are, another, option, for, protecting, against, credit, card, fraud, where, the, presentation, of, a, physical, card, is, not, required, as, in, telephone, and, online, purchasing, these, are, one, time, use, numbers, that, function, as, a, payment, card, and, are, linked, to, the, user, s, real, account, but, do, not, reveal, details, and, cannot, be, used, for, subsequent, unauthorized, transactions, they, can, be, valid, for, a, relatively, short, time, and, limited, to, the, actual, amount, of, the, purchase, or, a, limit, set, by, the, user, their, use, can, be, limited, to, one, merchant, if, the, number, given, to, the, merchant, is, compromised, it, will, be, rejected, if, an, attempt, is, made, to, use, it, a, second, time, a, similar, system, of, controls, can, be, used, on, physical, cards, technology, provides, the, option, for, banks, to, support, many, other, controls, too, that, can, be, turned, on, and, off, and, varied, by, the, credit, card, owner, in, real, time, as, circumstances, change, i, e, they, can, change, temporal, numerical, geographical, and, many, other, parameters, on, their, primary, and, subsidiary, cards, apart, from, the, obvious, benefits, of, such, controls, from, a, security, perspective, this, means, that, a, customer, can, have, a, chip, and, pin, card, secured, for, the, real, world, and, limited, for, use, in, the, home, country, in, this, eventuality, a, thief, stealing, the, details, will, be, prevented, from, using, these, overseas, in, non, chip, and, pin, emv, countries, similarly, the, real, card, can, be, restricted, from, use, online, so, that, stolen, details, will, be, declined, if, this, is, tried, then, when, card, users, shop, online, they, can, use, virtual, account, numbers, in, both, circumstances, an, alert, system, can, be, built, in, notifying, a, user, that, a, fraudulent, attempt, has, been, made, which, breaches, their, parameters, and, can, provide, data, on, this, in, real, time, additionally, there, are, security, features, present, on, the, physical, card, itself, in, order, to, prevent, counterfeiting, for, example, most, modern, credit, cards, have, a, watermark, that, will, fluoresce, under, ultraviolet, light, most, major, credit, cards, have,

introduced, to, the, more, common, credit, card, networks, but, none, has, proven, to, help, reduce, credit, card, fraud, so, far, first, the, cards, themselves, are, being, replaced, with, similar,

whether, the, merchant, is, suspicious, of, the, card, or, the, cardholder, the, merchant, may, be, asked, to, retain, the, card, if, it, is, safe, to, do, so, the, merchant, may, receive, a, reward, for, returning, a, confiscated, card, to, the, issuing, bank, especially, if, an, arrest, is, made, in, addition, to, fees, paid, by, the, card, holder, merchants, must, also, pay, interchange, fees, to, the, card, issuing, bank, and, the, card, association, for, a, typical, credit, card, issuer, interchange, fee, revenues, may, represent, about, a, quarter, of, total, revenues, these, fees, are, typically, from, 1, to, 6, percent, of, each, sale, but, will, vary, not, only, from, merchant, to, merchant, large, merchants, can, negotiate, lower, rates, but, also, from, card, to, card, with, business, cards, and, rewards, cards, generally, costing, the, merchants, more, to, process, the, interchange, fee, that, applies, to, a, particular, transaction, is, also, affected, by, many, other, variables, including, the, type, of, merchant, the, merchant, s, total, card, sales, volume, the, merchant, s, average, transaction, amount, whether, the, cards, were, physically, present, how, the, information, required, for, the, transaction, was, received, the, specific, type, of, card, when, the, transaction, was, settled, and, the, authorized, and, settled, transaction, amounts, in, some, cases, merchants, add, a, surcharge, to, the, credit, cards, to, cover, the, interchange, fee, encouraging, their, customers, to, instead, use, cash, debit, cards, or, even, cheques, the, 2022, proposed, change, in, interchange, fees, by, encouraging, use, of, multiple, card, networks, was, criticized, as, likely, to, reduce, fraud, detection, interest, charges, vary, widely, between, card, issuers, often, there, are, teaser, rates, or, promotional, apr, in, effect, for, initial, periods, of, time, as, low, as, zero, percent, for, say, six, months, whereas, regular, rates, can, be, as, high, as, 40, percent, in, the, u, s, there, is, no, federal, limit, on, the, interest, or, late, fees, credit, card, issuers, can, charge, the, interest, rates, are, set, by, the, states, with, some, states, such, as, south, dakota, having, no, ceiling, on, interest, rates, and, fees, inviting, some, banks, to, establish, their, credit, card, operations, there, other, states, for, example, delaware, have, very, weak, usury, laws, the, teaser, rate, no, longer, applies, if, the, customer, does, not, pay, their, bills, on, time, and, is, replaced, by, a, penalty, interest, rate, for,

incur, a, debt, which, is, charged, to, the, account, and, in, which, the, borrower, does, not, have, to, pay, the, outstanding, balance, on, that, account, in, full, every, month, the, borrower, may, be, required, to, make, a, minimum, payment, based, on, the, balance, amount, however, the, borrower, normally, has, the, discretion, to, pay, the, lender, any, amount, between, the, minimum, payment, and, the, full, balance, if, the, balance, is, not, paid, in, full, by, the, end, of, a, monthly, billing, period, the, remaining, balance, will, roll, over, or, revolve, into, the, next, month,

monthly, usage, cap, even, if, they, pay, off, during, the, month, and, so, never, exceed, their, credit, limit, and, other, issuers, charge, customers, who, overpay, and, so, have, a, negative, balance, in, the, u, s, the, credit, card, act, of, 2009, specifies, that, credit, card, companies, must, send, cardholders, a, notice, 45, days, before, they, can, increase, or, change, certain, fees, this, includes, annual, fees, cash, advance, fees, and, late, fees, one, controversial, area, is, the, trailing, interest, issue, trailing, interest, refers, to, interest, that, accrues, on, a, balance, after, the, monthly, statement, is, produced, but, before, the, balance, is, repaid, this, additional, interest, is, typically, added, to, the, following, monthly, statement, u, s, senator, carl, levin, raised, the, issue, of, millions, of, americans, affected, by, hidden, fees, compounding, interest, and, cryptic, terms, their, woes, were, heard, in, a, senate, permanent, subcommittee, on, investigations, hearing, which, was, chaired, by, senator, levin, who, said, that, he, intends, to, keep, the, spotlight, on, credit, card, companies, and, that, legislative, action, may, be, necessary, to, purge, the, industry, in, 2009, the, c, a, r, d, act, was, signed, into, law, enacting, protections, for, many, of, the, issues, levin, had, raised, in, the, united, kingdom, merchants, won, the, right, through, the, credit, cards, price, discrimination, order, 1990, to, charge, customers, different, prices, according, to, the, payment, method, this, was, later, removed, by, the, eu, s, 2nd, payment, services, directive, as, of, 2007, the, united, kingdom, was, one, of, the, world, s, most, credit, card, intensive, countries, with, 2, 4, credit, cards, per, consumer, according, to, the, u, k, payments, administration, ltd, in, the, united, states, until, 1984, federal, law, prohibited, surcharges, on, card, transactions, although, the, federal, truth, in, lending, act, provisions, that, prohibited, surcharges, expired, that, year, a, number, of, states, have, since, enacted, laws, that, continue, to, outlaw, the, practice, california, colorado, connecticut, florida, kansas, massachusetts, maine, new, york, oklahoma, and, texas, have, laws, against, surcharges, as, of, 2006, the, united, states, probably, had, one, of, the, world, s, highest, if, not, the, top, ratio, of, credit, cards, per, capita, with, 984, million, bank, issued, visa, and, mastercard, credit, card, and, debit, card, accounts, alone, for, an, adult, population, of, roughly, 220, million, people, the, credit, card, per, u, s, capita, ratio, was, nearly, 4, 1, as, of, 2003, and, as, high, as, 5, 1, as, of, 2006, consumers, who, keep, their, account, in, good, order, by, always, staying, within, their, credit, limit, and, always, making, at, least, the, minimum, monthly, payment, will, see, interest, as, the, biggest, expense, from, their, card, provider, those, who, are, not, so, careful, and, regularly, surpass, their, credit, limit, or, are, late, in, making, payments, were, exposed, to, multiple, charges, until, a, ruling, from, the, office, of, fair, trading, that, they, would, presume, charges, over, 12, to, be, unfair, which, led, the, majority, of, card, providers, to, reduce, their, fees, to, 12, the, higher, fees, originally, charged, were, claimed, to, be, designed, to, recoup, the, card, operator, s, overall, business, costs, and, to, try, to, ensure, that, the, credit, card, business, as, a, whole, generated, a, profit, rather, than, simply, recovering, the, cost, to, the, provider, of, the, limit, breach, which, has, been, estimated, as, typically, between, 3, 4, profiting, from, a, customer, s, mistakes, is, arguably, not, permitted, under, u, k, common, law, if, the, charges, constitute, penalties, for, breach, of, contract, or, under, the, unfair, terms, in, consumer, contracts, regulations, 1999, subsequent, rulings, in, respect, of, personal, current, accounts, suggest, that, the, argument, that, these, charges, are, penalties, for, breach, of, contract, is, weak, and, given, the, office, of, fair, trading, s, ruling, it, seems, unlikely, that, any, further, test, case, will, take, place, whilst, the, law, remains, in, the, balance, many, consumers, have, made, claims, against, their, credit, card, providers, for, the, charges, that, they, have, incurred, plus, interest, that, they, would, have, earned, had, the, money, not, been, deducted, from, their, account, it, is, likely, that, claims, for, amounts, charged, in, excess, of, 12, will, succeed, but, claims, for, charges, at, the, oft, s, 12, threshold, level, are, more, contentious, the, credit, card, act, of, 2009, requires, that, consumers, opt, in, to, over, limit, charges, some, card, issuers, have, therefore, commenced, solicitations, requesting, customers, to, opt, into, over, limit, fees, presenting, this, as, a, benefit, as, it, may, avoid, the, possibility, of, a, future, transaction, being, declined, other, issuers, have, simply, discontinued, the, practice, of, charging, over, limit, fees, whether, a, customer, opts, into, the, over, limit, fee, or, not, banks, will, in, practice, have, discretion, as, to, whether, they, choose, to, authorize, transactions, above, the, credit, limit, or, not, of, course, any, approved, over, limit, transactions, will, only, result, in, an, over, limit, fee, for, those, customers, who, have, opted, into, the, fee, this, legislation, took, effect, on, 22, february, 2010, following, this, act, the, companies, are, now, required, by, law, to, show, on, a, customer, s, bills, how, long, it, would, take, them, to, pay, off, the, balance, what, is, called, a, credit, card, in, the, united, states, meaning, the, customer, has, a, bill, to, pay, at, the, end, of, the, month, does, not, exist, in, the, french, banking, system, a, debit, card, debits, the, customer, s, account, as, the, transaction, is, made, while, a, credit, card, debits, it, at, the, end, of, the, month, automatically, making, it, impossible, to, fall, into, debt, by, forgetting, to, pay, a, credit, card, bill, specialized, credit, companies, can, provide, these, cards, but, they, are, separate, from, the, regular, banking, system, in, this, case, the, consumer, decides, the, maximum, amount, which, can, not, be, exceeded, credit, scores, or, credit, history, do, not, exist, in, france, and, therefore, the, need, to, build, a, credit, history, through, credit, cards, does, not, exist, personal, information, cannot, be, shared, among, banks, which, means, there, is, no, centralized, system, for, tracking, creditworthiness, the, only, centralized, system, in, france, is, for, individuals, who, have, not, repaid, credit, or, issued, checks, without, sufficient, funds, or, those, who, file, for, bankruptcy, this, system, is, handled, by, the, banque, de, france, in, vietnam,

the, applicant, s, income, credit, score, credit, history, and, personal, financial, profile, credit, limits, can, be, adjusted, upon, request, and, agreement, between, the, user, and, the, card, provider, the, penalty, for, exceeding, the, credit, limit, is, set, by, each, bank, and, usually, ranges, from, 1, to, 5, of, the, over, the, limit, amount, per, month, in, addition, cardholders, will, also, be, charged, interest, on, the, amount, spent, over, the, limit, in, comparison, interchange, fees, in, canada, average, 1, 78, and, 1, 73, in, the, us, these, caps, are, designed, to,

reward, programs, of, nearly, 200, credit, cards, available, in, canada, this, database, is, updated, on, a, quarterly, basis, with, information, supplied, by, credit, card, issuing, companies, information, in, the, database, is, published, every, quarter, on, the, website, of, the, financial, consumer, agency, of, canada, fcac, information, in, the, database, is, published, in, two, formats, it, is, available, in, pdf, comparison, tables, that, break, down, the, information, according, to, the, type, of, credit, card, allowing, the, reader, to, compare, the, features, of, for, example, all, the, student, credit, cards, in, the, database, the, database, also, feeds, into, an, interactive, tool, on, the, fcac, website, the, interactive, tool, uses, several, interview, type, questions, to, build, a, profile, of, the, user, s, credit, card, usage, habits, and, needs, eliminating, unsuitable, choices, based, on, the, profile, so, that, the, user, is, presented, with, a,

withdraw, money, against, the, credit, limit, extended, to, the, card, but, many, card, issuers, charge, interest, on, cash, advances, before, they, do, so, on, purchases, the, interest, on, cash, advances, is, commonly, charged, from, the, date, the, withdrawal, is, made, and, unlike, interest, on, purchases, the, interest, on, cash, advances, is, not, waived, even, if, the, customer, pays, the, statement, balance, in, full, many, card, issuers, levy, a, commission, for, cash, withdrawals, even, if, the, atm, belongs, to, the, same, bank, as, the, card, issuer, merchants, do, not, offer,

added, to, the, card, holder, s, cost, of, the, transaction, and, no, extra, fees, are, charged, as, the, transaction, is, not, considered, a, cash, advance, in, the, us, many, credit, card, companies, will, also, when, applying, payments, to, a, card, do, so, for, the, matter, at, hand, at, the, end, of, a, billing, cycle, and, apply, those, payments, to, everything, before, cash, advances, for, this, reason, many, consumers, have, large, cash, balances, which, have, no, grace, period, and, incur, interest, at, a, rate, that, is, usually, higher, than, the, purchase, rate, and, will, carry, those, balances, for, years, even, if, they, pay, off, their, statement, balance, each, month, this, practice, is, not, permitted, in, the, uk, where, the, law, states, that, any,
