humanities, are, academic, disciplines, that, study, aspects, of, human, society, and, culture, including, certain, fundamental, questions, asked, by, humans, during, the, renaissance, the, term, humanities, referred, to, the, study, of, classical, literature, and, language, as, opposed, to, the, study, of, religion, or, divinity, the, study, of, the, humanities, was, a, key, part, of, the, secular, curriculum, in, universities, at, the, time, today, the, humanities, are, more, frequently, defined, as, any, fields, of, study, outside, of, natural, sciences, social, sciences, formal, sciences, like, mathematics, and, applied, sciences, or, professional, training, they, use, methods, that, are, primarily, critical, speculative, or, interpretative, and, have, a, significant, historical, element, as, distinguished, from, the, mainly, empirical, approaches, of, science, the, humanities, include, the, studies, of, philosophy, religion, history, language, arts, literature, writing, oratory, rhetoric, poetry, etc, performing, arts, theater, music, dance, etc, and, visual, arts, painting, sculpture, photography, filmmaking, etc, some, definitions, of, the, humanities, encompass, law, and, religion, due, to, their, shared, characteristics, such, as, the, study, of, language, and, culture, however, these, definitions, are, not, universally, accepted, as, law, and, religion, are, often, considered, professional, subjects, rather, than, humanities, subjects, professional, subjects, like, some, social, sciences, are, sometimes, classified, as, being, part, of, both, the, liberal, arts, and, professional, development, education, whereas, humanities, subjects, are, generally, confined, to, the, traditional, liberal, arts, education, although, sociology, anthropology, archaeology, linguistics, and, psychology, share, some, similarities, with, the, humanities, these, are, often, considered, social, sciences, similarly, disciplines, such, as, finance, business, administration, political, science, economics, and, global, studies, have, closer, ties, to, the, social, sciences, rather, than, the, humanities, scholars, in, the, humanities, are, called, humanities, scholars, or, sometimes, humanists, the, term, humanist, also, describes, the, philosophical, position, of, humanism, which, antihumanist, scholars, in, the, humanities, reject, renaissance, scholars, and, artists, are, also, known, as, humanists, some, secondary, schools, offer, humanities, classes, usually, consisting, of, literature, history, foreign, language, and, art, human, disciplines, like, history, and, language, mainly, use, the, comparative, method, and, comparative, research, other, methods, used, in, the, humanities, include, hermeneutics, source, criticism, esthetic, interpretation, and, speculative, reason, the, word, humanities, comes, from, the, renaissance, latin, phrase, studia, humanitatis, which, translates, to, study, of, humanity, this, phrase, was, used, to, refer, to, the, study, of, classical, literature, and, language, which, was, seen, as, an, important, aspect, of, a, refined, education, in, the, renaissance, in, its, usage, in, the, early, 15th, century, the, studia, humanitatis, was, a, course, of, studies, that, consisted, of, grammar, poetry, rhetoric, history, and, moral, philosophy, primarily, derived, from, the, study, of, latin, and, greek, classics, the, word, humanitas, also, gave, rise, to, the, renaissance, italian, neologism, umanisti, whence, humanist, renaissance, humanism, classics, in, the, western, academic, tradition, refers, to, the, studies, of, the, cultures, of, classical, antiquity, namely, ancient, greek, and, latin, and, the, ancient, greek, and, roman, cultures, classical, studies, is, considered, one, of, the, cornerstones, of, the, humanities, however, its, popularity, declined, during, the, 20th, century, nevertheless, the, influence, of, classical, ideas, on, many, humanities, disciplines, such, as, philosophy, and, literature, remains, strong, history, is, systematically, collected, information, about, the, past, when, used, as, the, name, of, a, field, of, study, history, refers, to, the, study, and, interpretation, of, the, record, of, humans, societies, institutions, and, any, topic, that, has, changed, over, time, traditionally, the, study, of, history, has, been, considered, a, part, of, the, humanities, in, modern, academia, history, can, occasionally, be, classified, as, a, social, science, though, this, definition, is, contested, while, the, scientific, study, of, language, is, known, as, linguistics, and, is, generally, considered, a, social, science, a, natural, science, or, a, cognitive, science, the, study, of, languages, is, also, central, to, the, humanities, a, good, deal, of, twentieth, and, twenty, first, century, philosophy, has, been, devoted, to, the, analysis, of, language, and, to, the, question, of, whether, as, wittgenstein, claimed, many, of, our, philosophical, confusions, derive, from, the, vocabulary, we, use, literary, theory, has, explored, the, rhetorical, associative, and, ordering, features, of, language, and, historical, linguists, have, studied, the, development, of, languages, across, time, literature, covering, a, variety, of, uses, of, language, including, prose, forms, such, as, the, novel, poetry, and, drama, also, lies, at, the, heart, of, the, modern, humanities, curriculum, college, level, programs, in, a, foreign, language, usually, include, study, of, important, works, of, the, literature, in, that, language, as, well, as, the, language, itself, in, everyday, language, law, refers, to, a, rule, that, is, enforced, by, a, governing, institution, as, opposed, to, a, moral, or, ethical, rule, that, is, not, subject, to, formal, enforcement, the, study, of, law, can, be, seen, as, either, a, social, science, or, a, humanities, discipline, depending, on, one, s, perspective, some, see, it, as, a, social, science, because, of, its, objective, and, measurable, nature, while, others, view, it, as, a, humanities, discipline, because, of, its, focus, on, values, and, interpretation, law, is, not, always, enforceable, especially, in, the, international, relations, context, law, has, been, defined, in, various, ways, such, as, a, system, of, rules, an, interpretive, concept, for, achieving, justice, an, authority, to, mediate, between, people, s, interests, or, the, command, of, a, sovereign, backed, by, the, threat, of, punishment, however, one, likes, to, think, of, law, it, is, a, completely, central, social, institution, legal, policy, is, shaped, by, the, practical, application, of, ideas, from, many, social, science, and, humanities, disciplines, including, philosophy, history, political, science, economics, anthropology, and, sociology, law, is, politics, because, politicians, create, them, law, is, philosophy, because, moral, and, ethical, persuasions, shape, their, ideas, law, tells, many, of, history, s, stories, because, statutes, case, law, and, codifications, build, up, over, time, law, is, also, economics, because, any, rule, about, contract, tort, property, law, labour, law, company, law, and, many, more, can, have, long, lasting, effects, on, how, productivity, is, organised, and, the, distribution, of, wealth, the, noun, law, derives, from, the, old, english, word, lagu, meaning, something, laid, down, or, fixed, and, the, adjective, legal, comes, from, the, latin, word, lex, literature, is, a, term, that, does, not, have, a, universally, accepted, definition, but, which, has, variably, included, all, written, work, writing, that, possesses, literary, merit, and, language, that, emphasizes, its, own, literary, features, as, opposed, to, ordinary, language, etymologically, the, term, derives, from, the, latin, word, literatura, litteratura, which, means, writing, formed, with, letters, although, some, definitions, include, spoken, or, sung, texts, literature, can, be, classified, as, fiction, or, non, fiction, poetry, or, prose, it, can, be, further, distinguished, according, to, major, forms, such, as, the, novel, short, story, or, drama, and, works, are, often, categorised, according, to, historical, periods, or, according, to, their, adherence, to, certain, aesthetic, features, or, expectations, genre, philosophy, etymologically, the, love, of, wisdom, is, generally, the, study, of, problems, concerning, matters, such, as, existence, knowledge, justification, truth, justice, right, and, wrong, beauty, validity, mind, and, language, philosophy, is, distinguished, from, other, ways, of, addressing, these, issues, by, its, critical, generally, systematic, approach, and, its, reliance, on, reasoned, argument, rather, than, experiments, experimental, philosophy, being, an, exception, philosophy, used, to, be, a, very, comprehensive, term, including, what, have, subsequently, become, separate, disciplines, such, as, physics, as, immanuel, kant, noted, ancient, greek, philosophy, was, divided, into, three, sciences, physics, ethics, and, logic, today, the, main, fields, of, philosophy, are, logic, ethics, metaphysics, and, epistemology, still, it, continues, to, overlap, with, other, disciplines, the, field, of, semantics, for, example, brings, philosophy, into, contact, with, linguistics, since, the, early, twentieth, century, philosophy, in, english, speaking, universities, has, moved, away, from, the, humanities, and, closer, to, the, formal, sciences, becoming, much, more, analytic, analytic, philosophy, is, marked, by, emphasis, on, the, use, of, logic, and, formal, methods, of, reasoning, conceptual, analysis, and, the, use, of, symbolic, and, or, mathematical, logic, as, contrasted, with, the, continental, style, of, philosophy, this, method, of, inquiry, is, largely, indebted, to, the, work, of, philosophers, such, as, gottlob, frege, bertrand, russell, g, e, moore, and, ludwig, wittgenstein, religious, studies, is, commonly, regarded, as, a, social, science, based, on, current, knowledge, it, seems, that, all, known, cultures, both, in, the, past, and, present, have, some, form, of, belief, system, or, religious, practice, while, there, may, be, isolated, individuals, or, groups, who, do, not, practice, any, form, of, religion, it, is, not, known, if, there, has, ever, been, a, society, that, was, entirely, devoid, of, religious, belief, the, definition, of, religion, is, not, universal, and, different, cultures, may, have, different, ideas, about, what, constitutes, religion, religion, may, be, characterized, with, a, community, since, humans, are, social, animals, rituals, are, used, to, bound, the, community, together, social, animals, require, rules, ethics, is, a, requirement, of, society, but, not, a, requirement, of, religion, shinto, daoism, and, other, folk, or, natural, religions, do, not, have, ethical, codes, while, some, religions, do, include, the, concept, of, deities, others, do, not, therefore, the, supernatural, does, not, necessarily, require, the, existence, of, deities, rather, it, can, be, broadly, defined, as, any, phenomena, that, cannot, be, explained, by, science, or, reason, magical, thinking, creates, explanations, not, available, for, empirical, verification, stories, or, myths, are, narratives, being, both, didactic, and, entertaining, they, are, necessary, for, understanding, the, human, predicament, some, other, possible, characteristics, of, religion, are, pollutions, and, purification, the, sacred, and, the, profane, sacred, texts, religious, institutions, and, organizations, and, sacrifice, and, prayer, some, of, the, major, problems, that, religions, confront, and, attempts, to, answer, are, chaos, suffering, evil, and, death, the, non, founder, religions, are, hinduism, shinto, and, native, or, folk, religions, founder, religions, are, judaism, christianity, islam, confucianism, daoism, mormonism, jainism, zoroastrianism, buddhism, sikhism, and, the, bah, faith, religions, must, adapt, and, change, through, the, generations, because, they, must, remain, relevant, to, the, adherents, when, traditional, religions, fail, to, address, new, concerns, then, new, religions, will, emerge, the, performing, arts, differ, from, the, visual, arts, in, that, the, former, uses, the, artist, s, own, body, face, and, presence, as, a, medium, and, the, latter, uses, materials, such, as, clay, metal, or, paint, which, can, be, molded, or, transformed, to, create, some, art, object, performing, arts, include, acrobatics, busking, comedy, dance, film, magic, music, opera, juggling, marching, arts, such, as, brass, bands, and, theatre, artists, who, participate, in, these, arts, in, front, of, an, audience, are, called, performers, including, actors, comedians, dancers, musicians, and, singers, performing, arts, are, also, supported, by, workers, in, related, fields, such, as, songwriting, and, stagecraft, performers, often, adapt, their, appearance, such, as, with, costumes, and, stage, makeup, etc, there, is, also, a, specialized, form, of, fine, art, in, which, the, artists, perform, their, work, live, to, an, audience, this, is, called, performance, art, most, performance, art, also, involves, some, form, of, plastic, art, perhaps, in, the, creation, of, props, dance, was, often, referred, to, as, a, plastic, art, during, the, modern, dance, era, musicology, as, an, academic, discipline, can, take, a, number, of, different, paths, including, historical, musicology, music, literature, ethnomusicology, and, music, theory, undergraduate, music, majors, generally, take, courses, in, all, of, these, areas, while, graduate, students, focus, on, a, particular, path, in, the, liberal, arts, tradition, musicology, is, also, used, to, broaden, skills, of, non, musicians, by, teaching, skills, including, concentration, and, listening, theatre, or, theater, greek, theatron, is, the, branch, of, the, performing, arts, concerned, with, acting, out, stories, in, front, of, an, audience, using, combinations, of, speech, gesture, music, dance, sound, and, spectacle, indeed, any, one, or, more, elements, of, the, other, performing, arts, in, addition, to, the, standard, narrative, dialogue, style, theatre, takes, such, forms, as, opera, ballet, mime, kabuki, classical, indian, dance, chinese, opera, mummers, plays, and, pantomime, dance, from, old, french, dancier, perhaps, from, frankish, generally, refers, to, human, movement, either, used, as, a, form, of, expression, or, presented, in, a, social, spiritual, or, performance, setting, dance, is, also, used, to, describe, methods, of, non, verbal, communication, see, body, language, between, humans, or, animals, bee, dance, mating, dance, and, motion, in, inanimate, objects, the, leaves, danced, in, the, wind, choreography, is, the, process, of, creating, dances, and, the, people, who, create, choreography, are, known, as, choreographers, choreographers, use, movement, music, and, other, elements, to, create, expressive, and, artistic, dances, they, may, work, alone, or, with, other, artists, to, create, new, works, and, their, work, can, be, presented, in, a, variety, of, settings, from, small, dance, studios, to, large, theaters, definitions, of, what, constitutes, dance, are, dependent, on, social, cultural, aesthetic, artistic, and, moral, constraints, and, range, from, functional, movement, such, as, folk, dance, to, codified, virtuoso, techniques, such, as, ballet, the, great, traditions, in, art, have, a, foundation, in, the, art, of, one, of, the, ancient, civilizations, such, as, ancient, japan, greece, and, rome, china, india, greater, nepal, mesopotamia, and, mesoamerica, ancient, greek, art, saw, a, veneration, of, the, human, physical, form, and, the, development, of, equivalent, skills, to, show, musculature, poise, beauty, and, anatomically, correct, proportions, ancient, roman, art, depicted, gods, as, idealized, humans, shown, with, characteristic, distinguishing, features, e, g, zeus, thunderbolt, the, emphasis, on, spiritual, and, religious, themes, in, byzantine, and, gothic, art, of, the, middle, ages, reflected, the, dominance, of, the, church, however, in, the, renaissance, a, renewed, focus, on, the, physical, world, was, reflected, in, art, forms, that, depicted, the, human, body, and, landscape, in, a, more, naturalistic, and, three, dimensional, way, eastern, art, has, generally, worked, in, a, style, akin, to, western, medieval, art, namely, a, concentration, on, surface, patterning, and, local, colour, meaning, the, plain, colour, of, an, object, such, as, basic, red, for, a, red, robe, rather, than, the, modulations, of, that, colour, brought, about, by, light, shade, and, reflection, a, characteristic, of, this, style, is, that, the, local, colour, is, often, defined, by, an, outline, a, contemporary, equivalent, is, the, cartoon, this, is, evident, in, for, example, the, art, of, india, tibet, and, japan, religious, islamic, art, forbids, iconography, and, expresses, religious, ideas, through, geometry, instead, the, physical, and, rational, certainties, depicted, by, the, 19th, century, enlightenment, were, shattered, not, only, by, new, discoveries, of, relativity, by, einstein, and, of, unseen, psychology, by, freud, but, also, by, unprecedented, technological, development, increasing, global, interaction, during, this, time, saw, an, equivalent, influence, of, other, cultures, into, western, art, drawing, is, a, means, of, making, a, picture, using, a, wide, variety, of, tools, and, techniques, it, generally, involves, making, marks, on, a, surface, by, applying, pressure, from, a, tool, or, moving, a, tool, across, a, surface, common, tools, are, graphite, pencils, pen, and, ink, inked, brushes, wax, color, pencils, crayons, charcoals, pastels, and, markers, digital, tools, that, simulate, the, effects, of, these, are, also, used, the, main, techniques, used, in, drawing, are, line, drawing, hatching, crosshatching, random, hatching, scribbling, stippling, and, blending, a, computer, aided, designer, who, excels, in, technical, drawing, is, referred, to, as, a, draftsman, or, draughtsman, literally, painting, is, the, practice, of, applying, pigment, suspended, in, a, carrier, or, medium, and, a, binding, agent, a, glue, to, a, surface, support, such, as, paper, canvas, or, a, wall, however, when, used, in, an, artistic, sense, it, means, the, use, of, this, activity, in, combination, with, drawing, composition, and, other, aesthetic, considerations, in, order, to, manifest, the, expressive, and, conceptual, intention, of, the, practitioner, painting, has, been, used, throughout, history, to, express, spiritual, and, religious, ideas, from, mythological, scenes, on, pottery, to, the, frescoes, of, the, sistine, chapel, to, body, art, colour, is, highly, subjective, but, has, observable, psychological, effects, although, these, can, differ, from, one, culture, to, the, next, black, is, associated, with, mourning, in, the, west, but, elsewhere, white, may, be, some, painters, theoreticians, writers, and, scientists, including, goethe, kandinsky, isaac, newton, have, written, their, own, colour, theories, moreover, the, use, of, language, is, only, a, generalization, for, a, colour, equivalent, the, word, red, for, example, can, cover, a, wide, range, of, variations, on, the, pure, red, of, the, spectrum, unlike, music, where, notes, such, as, c, or, c, are, universally, accepted, there, is, no, formalized, register, of, colors, however, the, pantone, system, is, widely, used, in, the, printing, and, design, industry, to, standardize, color, reproduction, modern, artists, have, extended, the, practice, of, painting, considerably, to, include, for, example, collage, this, began, with, cubism, and, is, not, painting, in, strict, sense, some, modern, painters, incorporate, different, materials, such, as, sand, cement, straw, or, wood, for, their, texture, examples, of, these, are, the, works, of, jean, dubuffet, or, anselm, kiefer, modern, and, contemporary, art, has, moved, away, from, the, historic, value, of, craft, in, favour, of, concept, conceptual, art, this, has, led, some, e, g, joseph, kosuth, to, say, that, painting, as, a, serious, art, form, is, dead, although, this, has, not, deterred, the, majority, of, artists, from, continuing, to, practise, it, either, as, whole, or, part, of, their, work, sculpture, involves, creating, three, dimensional, forms, out, of, various, materials, these, typically, include, malleable, substances, like, clay, and, metal, but, may, also, extend, to, material, that, is, cut, or, shaved, down, to, the, desired, form, like, stone, and, wood, in, the, west, the, history, of, the, humanities, can, be, traced, to, ancient, greece, as, the, basis, of, a, broad, education, for, citizens, during, roman, times, the, concept, of, the, seven, liberal, arts, evolved, involving, grammar, rhetoric, and, logic, the, trivium, along, with, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and, music, the, quadrivium, these, subjects, formed, the, bulk, of, medieval, education, with, the, emphasis, being, on, the, humanities, as, skills, or, ways, of, doing, a, major, shift, occurred, with, the, renaissance, humanism, of, the, fifteenth, century, when, the, humanities, began, to, be, regarded, as, subjects, to, study, rather, than, practice, with, a, corresponding, shift, away, from, traditional, fields, into, areas, such, as, literature, and, history, studia, humaniora, in, the, 20th, century, this, view, was, in, turn, challenged, by, the, postmodernist, movement, which, sought, to, redefine, the, humanities, in, more, egalitarian, terms, suitable, for, a, democratic, society, since, the, greek, and, roman, societies, in, which, the, humanities, originated, were, elitist, and, aristocratic, a, distinction, is, usually, drawn, between, the, social, sciences, and, the, humanities, classicist, allan, bloom, writes, in, the, closing, of, the, american, mind, 1987, social, science, and, humanities, have, a, mutual, contempt, for, one, another, the, former, looking, down, on, the, latter, as, unscientific, the, latter, regarding, the, former, as, philistine, the, difference, comes, down, to, the, fact, that, social, science, really, wants, to, be, predictive, meaning, that, man, is, predictable, while, the, humanities, say, that, he, is, not, for, many, decades, there, has, been, a, growing, public, perception, that, a, humanities, education, inadequately, prepares, graduates, for, employment, the, common, belief, is, that, graduates, from, such, programs, face, underemployment, and, incomes, too, low, for, a, humanities, education, to, be, worth, the, investment, humanities, graduates, find, employment, in, a, wide, variety, of, management, and, professional, occupations, in, britain, for, example, over, 11, 000, humanities, majors, found, employment, in, the, following, occupations, many, humanities, graduates, may, find, themselves, with, no, specific, career, goals, upon, graduation, which, can, lead, to, lower, incomes, in, the, early, stages, of, their, career, on, the, other, hand, graduates, from, more, career, oriented, programs, often, find, jobs, more, quickly, however, the, long, term, career, prospects, of, humanities, graduates, may, be, similar, to, those, of, other, graduates, as, research, shows, that, by, five, years, after, graduation, they, generally, find, a, career, path, that, appeals, to, them, there, is, empirical, evidence, that, graduates, from, humanities, programs, earn, less, than, graduates, from, other, university, programs, however, the, empirical, evidence, also, shows, that, humanities, graduates, still, earn, notably, higher, incomes, than, workers, with, no, postsecondary, education, and, have, job, satisfaction, levels, comparable, to, their, peers, from, other, fields, humanities, graduates, also, earn, more, as, their, careers, progress, ten, years, after, graduation, the, income, difference, between, humanities, graduates, and, graduates, from, other, university, programs, is, no, longer, statistically, significant, humanities, graduates, can, boost, their, incomes, if, they, obtain, advanced, or, professional, degrees, the, humanities, indicators, unveiled, in, 2009, by, the, american, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, are, the, first, comprehensive, compilation, of, data, about, the, humanities, in, the, united, states, providing, scholars, policymakers, and, the, public, with, detailed, information, on, humanities, education, from, primary, to, higher, education, the, humanities, workforce, humanities, funding, and, research, and, public, humanities, activities, modeled, after, the, national, science, board, s, science, and, engineering, indicators, the, humanities, indicators, are, a, source, of, reliable, benchmarks, to, guide, analysis, of, the, state, of, the, humanities, in, the, united, states, the, 1980, united, states, rockefeller, commission, on, the, humanities, described, the, humanities, in, its, report, the, humanities, in, american, life, through, the, humanities, we, reflect, on, the, fundamental, question, what, does, it, mean, to, be, human, the, humanities, offer, clues, but, never, a, complete, answer, they, reveal, how, people, have, tried, to, make, moral, spiritual, and, intellectual, sense, of, a, world, where, irrationality, despair, loneliness, and, death, are, as, conspicuous, as, birth, friendship, hope, and, reason, in, 1950, 1, 2, of, americans, aged, 22, had, earned, a, degree, in, the, humanities, by, 2010, this, figure, had, risen, to, 2, 6, this, represents, a, doubling, of, the, number, of, americans, with, degrees, in, the, humanities, over, a, 60, year, period, the, increase, in, the, number, of, americans, with, humanities, degrees, is, in, part, due, to, the, overall, rise, in, college, enrollment, in, the, united, states, in, 1940, 4, 6, of, americans, had, a, four, year, degree, but, by, 2016, this, figure, had, risen, to, 33, 4, this, means, that, the, total, number, of, americans, with, college, degrees, has, increased, significantly, resulting, in, a, greater, number, of, people, with, degrees, in, the, humanities, as, well, the, proportion, of, degrees, awarded, in, the, humanities, has, declined, in, recent, decades, even, as, the, overall, number, of, people, with, humanities, degrees, has, increased, in, 1954, 36, percent, of, harvard, undergraduates, majored, in, the, humanities, but, in, 2012, only, 20, percent, took, that, course, of, study, as, recently, as, 1993, the, humanities, accounted, for, 15, of, the, bachelor, s, degrees, awarded, by, colleges, and, universities, in, the, united, states, as, of, 2022, they, accounted, for, less, than, 9, the, commission, on, the, humanities, and, social, sciences, 2013, report, the, heart, of, the, matter, supports, the, notion, of, a, broad, liberal, arts, education, which, includes, study, in, disciplines, from, the, natural, sciences, to, the, arts, as, well, as, the, humanities, many, colleges, provide, such, an, education, some, require, it, the, university, of, chicago, and, columbia, university, were, among, the, first, schools, to, require, an, extensive, core, curriculum, in, philosophy, literature, and, the, arts, for, all, students, other, colleges, with, nationally, recognized, mandatory, programs, in, the, liberal, arts, are, fordham, university, st, john, s, college, saint, anselm, college, and, providence, college, prominent, proponents, of, liberal, arts, in, the, united, states, have, included, mortimer, j, adler, and, e, d, hirsch, jr, researchers, in, the, humanities, have, developed, numerous, large, and, small, scale, digital, corporations, such, as, digitized, collections, of, historical, texts, along, with, the, digital, tools, and, methods, to, analyze, them, their, aim, is, both, to, uncover, new, knowledge, about, corpora, and, to, visualize, research, data, in, new, and, revealing, ways, much, of, this, activity, occurs, in, a, field, called, the, digital, humanities, politicians, in, the, united, states, currently, espouse, a, need, for, increased, funding, of, the, stem, fields, science, technology, engineering, mathematics, federal, funding, represents, a, much, smaller, fraction, of, funding, for, humanities, than, other, fields, such, as, stem, or, medicine, the, result, was, a, decline, of, quality, in, both, college, and, pre, college, education, in, the, humanities, field, three, term, louisiana, governor, edwin, edwards, acknowledged, the, importance, of, the, humanities, in, a, 2014, video, address, to, the, academic, conference, revolutions, in, eighteenth, century, sociability, edwards, said, the, contemporary, debate, in, the, field, of, critical, university, studies, centers, around, the, declining, value, of, the, humanities, as, in, america, there, is, a, perceived, decline, in, interest, within, higher, education, policy, in, research, that, is, qualitative, and, does, not, produce, marketable, products, this, threat, can, be, seen, in, a, variety, of, forms, across, europe, but, much, critical, attention, has, been, given, to, the, field, of, research, assessment, in, particular, for, example, the, uk, has, been, subject, to, criticism, due, to, its, assessment, criteria, from, across, the, humanities, and, indeed, the, social, sciences, in, particular, the, notion, of, impact, has, generated, significant, debate, since, the, late, 19th, century, a, central, justification, for, the, humanities, has, been, that, it, aids, and, encourages, self, reflection, a, self, reflection, that, in, turn, helps, develop, personal, consciousness, or, an, active, sense, of, civic, duty, wilhelm, dilthey, and, hans, georg, gadamer, centered, the, humanities, attempt, to, distinguish, itself, from, the, natural, sciences, in, humankind, s, urge, to, understand, its, own, experiences, this, understanding, they, claimed, ties, like, minded, people, from, similar, cultural, backgrounds, together, and, provides, a, sense, of, cultural, continuity, with, the, philosophical, past, scholars, in, the, late, 20th, and, early, 21st, centuries, extended, that, narrative, imagination, to, the, ability, to, understand, the, records, of, lived, experiences, outside, of, one, s, own, individual, social, and, cultural, context, through, that, narrative, imagination, it, is, claimed, humanities, scholars, and, students, develop, a, conscience, more, suited, to, the, multicultural, world, we, live, in, that, conscience, might, take, the, form, of, a, passive, one, that, allows, more, effective, self, reflection, or, extend, into, active, empathy, that, facilitates, the, dispensation, of, civic, duties, a, responsible, world, citizen, must, engage, in, there, is, disagreement, however, on, the, level, of, influence, humanities, study, can, have, on, an, individual, and, whether, or, not, the, understanding, produced, in, humanistic, enterprise, can, guarantee, an, identifiable, positive, effect, on, people, there, are, three, major, branches, in, the, human, sciences, humanities, these, are, the, natural, sciences, the, social, sciences, and, the, cultural, sciences, technology, is, the, practical, extension, of, the, natural, sciences, as, politics, is, the, extension, of, the, social, sciences, similarly, the, cultural, sciences, have, their, own, practical, extension, sometimes, called, culturonics, mikhail, epstein, s, term, the, three, extensions, can, be, combined, to, form, the, transhumanities, technology, politics, and, culturonics, are, designed, to, transform, what, their, respective, disciplines, study, nature, society, and, culture, the, field, of, transformative, humanities, includes, various, practicies, and, technologies, for, example, language, planning, the, construction, of, new, languages, like, esperanto, and, invention, of, new, artistic, and, literary, genres, and, movements, in, the, genre, of, manifesto, like, romanticism, symbolism, or, surrealism, humanistic, invention, in, the, sphere, of, culture, as, a, practice, complementary, to, scholarship, is, an, important, aspect, of, the, humanities, the, divide, between, humanistic, study, and, natural, sciences, informs, arguments, of, meaning, in, humanities, as, well, what, distinguishes, the, humanities, from, the, natural, sciences, is, not, a, certain, subject, matter, but, rather, the, mode, of, approach, to, any, question, humanities, focuses, on, understanding, meaning, purpose, and, goals, and, furthers, the, appreciation, of, singular, historical, and, social, phenomena, an, interpretive, method, of, finding, truth, rather, than, explaining, the, causality, of, events, or, uncovering, the, truth, of, the, natural, world, apart, from, its, societal, application, narrative, imagination, is, an, important, tool, in, the, re, production, of, understood, meaning, in, history, culture, and, literature, imagination, as, part, of, the, tool, kit, of, artists, or, scholars, helps, create, meaning, that, invokes, a, response, from, an, audience, since, a, humanities, scholar, is, always, within, the, nexus, of, lived, experiences, no, absolute, knowledge, is, theoretically, possible, knowledge, is, instead, a, ceaseless, procedure, of, inventing, and, reinventing, the, context, a, text, is, read, in, poststructuralism, has, problematized, an, approach, to, the, humanistic, study, based, on, questions, of, meaning, intentionality, and, authorship, in, the, wake, of, the, death, of, the, author, proclaimed, by, roland, barthes, various, theoretical, currents, such, as, deconstruction, and, discourse, analysis, seek, to, expose, the, ideologies, and, rhetoric, operative, in, producing, both, the, purportedly, meaningful, objects, and, the, hermeneutic, subjects, of, humanistic, study, this, exposure, has, opened, up, the, interpretive, structures, of, the, humanities, to, criticism, that, humanities, scholarship, is, unscientific, and, therefore, unfit, for, inclusion, in, modern, university, curricula, because, of, the, very, nature, of, its, changing, contextual, meaning, some, like, stanley, fish, have, claimed, that, the, humanities, can, defend, themselves, best, by, refusing, to, make, any, claims, of, utility, fish, may, well, be, thinking, primarily, of, literary, study, rather, than, history, and, philosophy, any, attempt, to, justify, the, humanities, in, terms, of, outside, benefits, such, as, social, usefulness, say, increased, productivity, or, in, terms, of, ennobling, effects, on, the, individual, such, as, greater, wisdom, or, diminished, prejudice, is, ungrounded, according, to, fish, and, simply, places, impossible, demands, on, the, relevant, academic, departments, furthermore, critical, thinking, while, arguably, a, result, of, humanistic, training, can, be, acquired, in, other, contexts, and, the, humanities, do, not, even, provide, any, more, the, kind, of, social, cachet, what, sociologists, sometimes, call, cultural, capital, that, was, helpful, to, succeed, in, western, society, before, the, age, of, mass, education, following, world, war, ii, instead, scholars, like, fish, suggest, that, the, humanities, offer, a, unique, kind, of, pleasure, a, pleasure, based, on, the, common, pursuit, of, knowledge, even, if, it, is, only, disciplinary, knowledge, such, pleasure, contrasts, with, the, increasing, privatization, of, leisure, and, instant, gratification, characteristic, of, western, culture, it, thus, meets, j, rgen, habermas, requirements, for, the, disregard, of, social, status, and, rational, problematization, of, previously, unquestioned, areas, necessary, for, an, endeavor, which, takes, place, in, the, bourgeois, public, sphere, in, this, argument, then, only, the, academic, pursuit, of, pleasure, can, provide, a, link, between, the, private, and, the, public, realm, in, modern, western, consumer, society, and, strengthen, that, public, sphere, that, according, to, many, theorists, is, the, foundation, for, modern, democracy, others, like, mark, bauerlein, argue, that, professors, in, the, humanities, have, increasingly, abandoned, proven, methods, of, epistemology, i, care, only, about, the, quality, of, your, arguments, not, your, conclusions, in, favor, of, indoctrination, i, care, only, about, your, conclusions, not, the, quality, of, your, arguments, the, result, is, that, professors, and, their, students, adhere, rigidly, to, a, limited, set, of, viewpoints, and, have, little, interest, in, or, understanding, of, opposing, viewpoints, once, they, obtain, this, intellectual, self, satisfaction, persistent, lapses, in, learning, research, and, evaluation, are, common, implicit, in, many, of, these, arguments, supporting, the, humanities, are, the, makings, of, arguments, against, public, support, of, the, humanities, joseph, carroll, asserts, that, we, live, in, a, changing, world, a, world, where, cultural, capital, is, replaced, with, scientific, literacy, and, in, which, the, romantic, notion, of, a, renaissance, humanities, scholar, is, obsolete, such, arguments, appeal, to, judgments, and, anxieties, about, the, essential, uselessness, of, the, humanities, especially, in, an, age, when, it, is, seemingly, vitally, important, for, scholars, of, literature, history, and, the, arts, to, engage, in, collaborative, work, with, experimental, scientists, or, even, simply, to, make, intelligent, use, of, the, findings, from, empirical, science, despite, many, humanities, based, arguments, against, the, humanities, some, within, the, exact, sciences, have, called, for, their, return, in, 2017, science, popularizer, bill, nye, retracted, previous, claims, about, the, supposed, uselessness, of, philosophy, as, bill, nye, states, people, allude, to, socrates, and, plato, and, aristotle, all, the, time, and, i, think, many, of, us, who, make, those, references, don, t, have, a, solid, grounding, he, said, it, s, good, to, know, the, history, of, philosophy, scholars, such, as, biologist, scott, f, gilbert, make, the, claim, that, it, is, in, fact, the, increasing, predominance, leading, to, exclusivity, of, scientific, ways, of, thinking, that, need, to, be, tempered, by, historical, and, social, context, gilbert, worries, that, the, commercialization, that, may, be, inherent, in, some, ways, of, conceiving, science, pursuit, of, funding, academic, prestige, etc, need, to, be, examined, externally, gilbert, argues, first, of, all, there, is, a, very, successful, alternative, to, science, as, a, commercialized, march, to, progress, this, is, the, approach, taken, by, the, liberal, arts, college, a, model, that, takes, pride, in, seeing, science, in, context, and, in, integrating, science, with, the, humanities, and, social, sciences
