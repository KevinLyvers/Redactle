the, bantu, peoples, are, an, indigenous, ethnolinguistic, grouping, of, approximately, 400, distinct, native, african, ethnic, groups, who, speak, bantu, languages, the, languages, are, native, to, countries, spread, over, a, vast, area, from, west, africa, to, central, africa, southeast, africa, and, into, southern, africa, bantu, people, also, inhabit, southern, areas, of, northeast, african, states, there, are, several, hundred, bantu, languages, depending, on, the, definition, of, language, or, dialect, it, is, estimated, that, there, are, between, 440, and, 680, distinct, languages, the, total, number, of, speakers, is, in, the, hundreds, of, millions, ranging, at, roughly, 350, million, in, the, mid, 2010s, roughly, 30, of, the, population, of, africa, or, roughly, 5, of, the, total, world, population, about, 60, million, speakers, 2015, divided, into, some, 200, ethnic, or, tribal, groups, are, found, in, the, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, alone, the, larger, of, the, individual, bantu, groups, have, populations, of, several, million, e, g, the, large, majority, of, west, africa, notably, the, most, populous, african, nation, nigeria, rwanda, tanzania, uganda, kenya, burundi, 25, million, the, baganda, people, of, uganda, 5, 5, million, as, of, 2014, the, shona, of, zimbabwe, 17, 6, million, as, of, 2020, the, zulu, of, south, africa, 14, 2, million, as,

is, the, plural, of, the, word, umuntu, meaning, person, and, is, based, on, the, stem, ntu, plus, the, plural, prefix, aba, in, linguistics, the, word, bantu, for, the, language, families, and, its, speakers, is, an, artificial, term, based, on, the, reconstructed, proto, bantu, term, for, people, or, humans, it, was, first, introduced, into, modern, academia, as, b, ntu, by, wilhelm, bleek, in, 1857, or, 1858, and, popularised, in, his, comparative, grammar, of, 1862, the, name, was, said, to, be, coined, to, represent, the, word, for, people, in, loosely, reconstructed, proto, bantu, from, the, plural, noun, class, prefix, ba, categorizing, people, and, the, root, nt, some, entity, any, e, g, xhosa, umntu, person, abantu, people, zulu, umuntu, person, abantu, people, there, is, no, native, term, for, the, people, who, speak, bantu, languages, because, they, are, not, an, ethnic, group, people, speaking, bantu, languages, refer, to, their, languages, by, ethnic, endonyms, which, did, not, have, an, indigenous, concept, prior, to, european, contact, for, the, larger, ethnolinguistic, phylum, named, by, 19th, century, european, linguists, bleek, s, coinage, was, inspired, by, the, anthropological, observation, of, groups, self, identifying, as, people, or, the, true, people, that, is, idiomatically, the, reflexes, of, bant, in, the, numerous, languages, often, have, connotations, of, personal, character, traits, as, encompassed, under, the, values, system, of, ubuntu, also, known, as, hunhu, in, chishona, or, botho, in, sesotho, rather, than, just, referring, to, all, human, beings, the, root, in, proto, bantu, is, reconstructed, as, nt, versions, of, the, word, bantu, that, is, the, root, plus, the, class, 2, noun, class, prefix, ba, occur, in, all, bantu, languages, for, example, as, bantu, in, kikongo, kituba, tshiluba, and, kiluba, watu, in, swahili, anthu, in, tumbuka, anthu, in, chichewa, batu, in, lingala, bato, in, duala, abanto, in, gusii, and, in, kamba, and, kikuyu, abantu, in, kirundi, lusoga, zulu, xhosa, runyoro, and, luganda, wandru, in, shingazidja, abantru, in, mpondo, and, ndebele, b, thfu, in, phuthi, bantfu, in, swati, and, bhaca,

bhandu, in, nyakyusa, within, the, fierce, debate, among, linguists, about, the, word, bantu, seidensticker, 2024, indicates, that, there, has, been, a, profound, conceptual, trend, in, which, a, purely, technical, without, any, non, linguistic, connotations, was, transformed, into, a, designation, referring, indiscriminately, to, language, culture, society, and, race, bantu, languages, derive, from, the, proto, bantu, reconstructed, language, estimated, to, have, been, spoken, about, 4, 000, to, 3, 000, years, ago, in, west, central, africa, the, area, of, modern, day, cameroon, they, were, supposedly, spread, across, central, east, and, southern, africa, in, the, so, called, bantu, expansion, comparatively, rapid, dissemination, taking, roughly, two, millennia, and, dozens, of, human, generations, during, the, 1st, millennium, bc, and, the, 1st, millennium, ad, scientists, from, the, institut, pasteur, and, the, cnrs, together, with, a, broad, international, consortium, retraced, the, migratory, routes, of, the, bantu, populations, which, were, previously, a, source, of, debate, the, scientists, used, data, from, a, vast, genomic, analysis, of, more, than, 2, 000, samples, taken, from, individuals, in, 57, populations, throughout, sub, saharan, africa, to, trace, the, bantu, expansion, during, a, wave, of, expansion, that, began, 4, 000, to, 5, 000, years, ago, bantu, speaking, populations, some, 310, million, people, as, of, 2023, gradually, left, their, original, homeland, west, central, africa, and, travelled, to, the, eastern, and, southern, regions, of, the, african, continent, during, the, bantu, expansion, bantu, speaking, peoples, extirpated, and, displaced, many, earlier, inhabitants, with, only, a, few, modern, peoples, such, as, pygmy, groups, in, central, africa, the, hadza, people, in, northern, tanzania, and, various, khoisan, populations, across, southern, africa, remaining, in, existence, into, the, era, of, european, contact, archaeological, evidence, attests, to, their, presence, in, areas, subsequently, occupied, by, bantu, speakers, researchers, have, demonstrated, that, the, khoisan, of, the, kalahari, are, remnants, of, a, huge, ancestral, population, that, may, have, been, the, most, populous, group, on, the, planet, prior, to, the, bantu, expansion, biochemist, stephan, schuster, of, nanyang, technological, university, in, singapore, and, colleagues, found, that, the, khoisan, population, began, a, drastic, decline, when, the, bantu, farmers, spread, through, africa, 4, 000, years, ago, before, the, bantu, expansion, had, been, definitively, traced, starting, from, their, origins, in, the, region, between, cameroon, and, nigeria, two, main, scenarios, of, the, bantu, expansion, were, hypothesized, an, early, expansion, to, central, africa, and, a, single, origin, of, the, dispersal, radiating, from, there, or, an, early, separation, into, an, eastward, and, a, southward, wave, of, dispersal, with, one, wave, moving, across, the, congo, basin, toward, east, africa, and, another, moving, south, along, the, african, coast, and, the, congo, river, system, toward, angola, genetic, analysis, shows, a, significant, clustered, variation, of, genetic, traits, among, bantu, language, speakers, by, region, suggesting, admixture, from, prior, local, populations, bantu, speakers, of, south, africa, xhosa, venda, showed, substantial, levels, of, the, sak, and, western, african, bantu, aacs, and, low, levels, of, the, east, african, bantu, aac, the, latter, is, also, present, in, bantu, speakers, from, the, democratic, republic, of, congo, and, rwanda, the, results, indicate, distinct, east, african, bantu, migration, into, southern, africa, and, are, consistent, with, linguistic, and, archeological, evidence, of, east, african, bantu, migration, from, an, area, west, of, lake, victoria, and, the, incorporation, of, khoekhoe, ancestry, into, several, of, the, southeast, bantu, populations, 1500, to, 1000, years, ago, bantu, speaking, migrants, would, have, also, interacted, with, some, afro, asiatic, outlier, groups, in, the, southeast, mainly, cushitic, as, well, as, nilotic, and, central, sudanic, speaking, groups, according, to, the, early, split, scenario, as, hypothesized, in, the, 1990s, the, southward, dispersal, had, reached, the, congo, rainforest, by, about, 1500, bc, and, the, southern, savannas, by, 500, bc, while, the, eastward, dispersal, reached, the, great, lakes, by, 1000, bc, expanding, further, from, there, as, the, rich, environment, supported, dense, populations, possible, movements, by, small, groups, to, the, southeast, from, the, great, lakes, region, could, have, been, more, rapid, with, initial, settlements, widely, dispersed, near, the, coast, and, near, rivers, because, of, comparatively, harsh, farming, conditions, in, areas, farther, from, water, recent, archeological, and, linguistic, evidence, about, population, movements, suggests, that, pioneering, groups, would, have, had, reached, parts, of, modern, kwazulu, natal, in, south, africa, sometime, prior, to, the, 3rd, century, ad, along, the, coast, and, the, modern, northern, cape, by, ad, 500, cattle, terminology, in, use, amongst, the, relatively, few, modern, bantu, pastoralist, groups, suggests, that, the, acquisition, of, cattle, may, have, been, from, central, sudanic, kuliak, and, cushitic, speaking, neighbors, linguistic, evidence, also, indicates, that, the, customs, of, milking, cattle, were, also, directly, modeled, from, cushitic, cultures, in, the, area, cattle, terminology, in, southern, african, bantu, languages, differs, from, that, found, among, more, northerly, bantu, speaking, peoples, one, recent, suggestion, is, that, cushitic, speakers, had, moved, south, earlier, and, interacted, with, the, most, northerly, of, khoisan, speakers, who, acquired, cattle, from, them, and, that, the, earliest, arriving, bantu, speakers, in, turn, got, their, initial, cattle, from, cushitic, influenced, khwe, speaking, people, under, this, hypothesis, larger, later, bantu, speaking, immigration, subsequently, displaced, or, assimilated, that, southernmost, extension, of, the, range, of, cushitic, speakers, based, on, dental, evidence, irish, 2016, concluded, proto, bantu, peoples, may, have, originated, in, the, western, region, of, the, sahara, amid, the, kiffian, period, at, gobero, and, may, have, migrated, southward, from, the, sahara, into, various, parts, of, west, africa, e, g, benin, cameroon, ghana, nigeria, togo, as, a, result, of, desertification, of, the, green, sahara, in, 7000, bce, from, nigeria, and, cameroon, agricultural, proto, bantu, peoples, began, to, migrate, and, amid, migration, diverged, into, east, bantu, peoples, e, g, democratic, republic, of, congo, and, west, bantu, peoples, e, g, congo, gabon, between, 2500, bce, and, 1200, bce, irish, 2016, also,

comparable, sites, in, southern, africa, include, bumbusi, in, zimbabwe, and, manyikeni, in, mozambique, from, the, 12th, century, onward, the, processes, of, state, formation, amongst, bantu, peoples, increased, in, frequency, this, was, the, result, of, several, factors, such, as, a, denser, population, which, led, to, more, specialized, divisions, of, labor, including, military, power, while, making, emigration, more, difficult, technological, developments, in, economic, activity, and, new, techniques, in, the, political, spiritual, ritualisation, of, royalty, as, the, source, of,

term, african, instead, so, that, bantu, became, identified, with, the, policies, of, apartheid, by, the, 1970s, this, so, discredited, bantu, as, an, ethnic, racial, designation, that, the, apartheid, government, switched, to, the, term, black, in, its, official, racial, categorizations, restricting, it, to, bantu, speaking, africans, at, about, the, same, time, that, the, black,
