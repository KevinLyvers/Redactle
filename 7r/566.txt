philosophers, works, magna, carta, libertatum, medieval, latin, for, great, charter, of, freedoms, commonly, called, magna, carta, or, sometimes, magna, charta, great, charter, is, a, royal, charter, of, rights, agreed, to, by, king, john, of, england, at, runnymede, near, windsor, on, 15, june, 1215, first, drafted, by, the, archbishop, of, canterbury, cardinal, stephen, langton, to, make, peace, between, the, unpopular, king, and, a, group, of, rebel, barons, it, promised, the, protection, of, church, rights, protection, for, the, barons, from, illegal, imprisonment, access, to, swift, and, impartial, justice, and, limitations, on, feudal, payments, to, the, crown, to, be, implemented, through, a, council, of, 25, barons, neither, side, stood, by, their, commitments, and, the, charter, was, annulled, by, pope, innocent, iii, leading, to, the, first, barons, war, after, john, s, death, the, regency, government, of, his, young, son, henry, iii, reissued, the, document, in, 1216, stripped, of, some, of, its, more, radical, content, in, an, unsuccessful, bid, to, build, political, support, for, their, cause, at, the, end, of, the, war, in, 1217, it, formed, part, of, the, peace, treaty, agreed, at, lambeth, where, the, document, acquired, the, name, magna, carta, to, distinguish, it, from, the, smaller, charter, of, the, forest, which, was, issued, at, the, same, time, short, of, funds, henry, reissued, the, charter, again, in, 1225, in, exchange, for, a, grant, of, new, taxes, his, son, edward, i, repeated, the, exercise, in, 1297, this, time, confirming, it, as, part, of, england, s, statute, law, however, the, magna, carta, was, not, unique, other, legal, documents, of, its, time, both, in, england, and, beyond, made, broadly, similar, statements, of, rights, and, limitations, on, the, powers, of, the, crown, the, charter, became, part, of, english, political, life, and, was, typically, renewed, by, each, monarch, in, turn, although, as, time, went, by, and, the, fledgling, parliament, of, england, passed, new, laws, it, lost, some, of, its, practical, significance, at, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, there, was, an, upsurge, in, interest, in, magna, carta, lawyers, and, historians, at, the, time, believed, that, there, was, an, ancient, english, constitution, going, back, to, the, days, of, the, anglo, saxons, that, protected, individual, english, freedoms, they, argued, that, the, norman, invasion, of, 1066, had, overthrown, these, rights, and, that, magna, carta, had, been, a, popular, attempt, to, restore, them, making, the, charter, an, essential, foundation, for, the, contemporary, powers, of, parliament, and, legal, principles, such, as, habeas, corpus, although, this, historical, account, was, badly, flawed, jurists, such, as, sir, edward, coke, used, magna, carta, extensively, in, the, early, 17th, century, arguing, against, the, divine, right, of, kings, both, james, i, and, his, son, charles, i, attempted, to, suppress, the, discussion, of, magna, carta, the, political, myth, of, magna, carta, and, its, protection, of, ancient, personal, liberties, persisted, after, the, glorious, revolution, of, 1688, until, well, into, the, 19th, century, it, influenced, the, early, american, colonists, in, the, thirteen, colonies, and, the, formation, of, the, united, states, constitution, which, became, the, supreme, law, of, the, land, in, the, new, republic, of, the, united, states, research, by, victorian, historians, showed, that, the, original, 1215, charter, had, concerned, the, medieval, relationship, between, the, monarch, and, the, barons, rather, than, the, rights, of, ordinary, people, the, majority, of, historians, now, see, the, interpretation, of, the, charter, as, a, unique, and, early, charter, of, universal, legal, rights, as, a, myth, that, was, created, centuries, later, despite, the, changes, in, views, of, historians, the, charter, has, remained, a, powerful, iconic, document, even, after, almost, all, of, its, content, was, repealed, from, the, statute, books, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, magna, carta, still, forms, an, important, symbol, of, liberty, today, often, cited, by, politicians, and, campaigners, and, is, held, in, great, respect, by, the, british, and, american, legal, communities, lord, denning, describing, it, in, 1956, as, the, greatest, constitutional, document, of, all, times, the, foundation, of, the, freedom, of, the, individual, against, the, arbitrary, authority, of, the, despot, in, the, 21st, century, four, exemplifications, of, the, original, 1215, charter, remain, in, existence, two, at, the, british, library, one, at, lincoln, castle, and, one, at, salisbury, cathedral, there, are, also, a, handful, of, the, subsequent, charters, in, public, and, private, ownership, including, copies, of, the, 1297, charter, in, both, the, united, states, and, australia, the, 800th, anniversary, of, magna, carta, in, 2015, included, extensive, celebrations, and, discussions, and, the, four, original, 1215, charters, were, displayed, together, at, the, british, library, none, of, the, original, 1215, magna, carta, is, currently, in, force, since, it, has, been, repealed, however, four, clauses, of, the, original, charter, are, enshrined, in, the, 1297, reissued, magna, carta, and, do, still, remain, in, force, in, england, and, wales, magna, carta, originated, as, an, unsuccessful, attempt, to, achieve, peace, between, royalist, and, rebel, factions, in, 1215, as, part, of, the, events, leading, to, the, outbreak, of, the, first, barons, war, england, was, ruled, by, king, john, the, third, of, the, angevin, kings, although, the, kingdom, had, a, robust, administrative, system, the, nature, of, government, under, the, angevin, monarchs, was, ill, defined, and, uncertain, john, and, his, predecessors, had, ruled, using, the, principle, of, vis, et, voluntas, or, force, and, will, taking, executive, and, sometimes, arbitrary, decisions, often, justified, on, the, basis, that, a, king, was, above, the, law, many, contemporary, writers, believed, that, monarchs, should, rule, in, accordance, with, the, custom, and, the, law, with, the, counsel, of, the, leading, members, of, the, realm, but, there, was, no, model, for, what, should, happen, if, a, king, refused, to, do, so, john, had, lost, most, of, his, ancestral, lands, in, france, to, king, philip, ii, in, 1204, and, had, struggled, to, regain, them, for, many, years, raising, extensive, taxes, on, the, barons, to, accumulate, money, to, fight, a, war, which, ended, in, expensive, failure, in, 1214, following, the, defeat, of, his, allies, at, the, battle, of, bouvines, john, had, to, sue, for, peace, and, pay, compensation, john, was, already, personally, unpopular, with, many, of, the, barons, many, of, whom, owed, money, to, the, crown, and, little, trust, existed, between, the, two, sides, a, triumph, would, have, strengthened, his, position, but, in, the, face, of, his, defeat, within, a, few, months, after, his, return, from, france, john, found, that, rebel, barons, in, the, north, and, east, of, england, were, organising, resistance, to, his, rule, the, rebels, took, an, oath, that, they, would, stand, fast, for, the, liberty, of, the, church, and, the, realm, and, demanded, that, the, king, confirm, the, charter, of, liberties, that, had, been, declared, by, king, henry, i, in, the, previous, century, and, which, was, perceived, by, the, barons, to, protect, their, rights, the, rebel, leadership, was, unimpressive, by, the, standards, of, the, time, even, disreputable, but, were, united, by, their, hatred, of, john, robert, fitzwalter, later, elected, leader, of, the, rebel, barons, claimed, publicly, that, john, had, attempted, to, rape, his, daughter, and, was, implicated, in, a, plot, to, assassinate, john, in, 1212, john, held, a, council, in, london, in, january, 1215, to, discuss, potential, reforms, and, sponsored, discussions, in, oxford, between, his, agents, and, the, rebels, during, the, spring, both, sides, appealed, to, pope, innocent, iii, for, assistance, in, the, dispute, during, the, negotiations, the, rebellious, barons, produced, an, initial, document, which, historians, have, termed, the, unknown, charter, of, liberties, which, drew, on, henry, i, s, charter, of, liberties, for, much, of, its, language, seven, articles, from, that, document, later, appeared, in, the, articles, of, the, barons, and, the, subsequent, charter, it, was, john, s, hope, that, the, pope, would, give, him, valuable, legal, and, moral, support, and, accordingly, john, played, for, time, the, king, had, declared, himself, to, be, a, papal, vassal, in, 1213, and, correctly, believed, he, could, count, on, the, pope, for, help, john, also, began, recruiting, mercenary, forces, from, france, although, some, were, later, sent, back, to, avoid, giving, the, impression, that, the, king, was, escalating, the, conflict, in, a, further, move, to, shore, up, his, support, john, took, an, oath, to, become, a, crusader, a, move, which, gave, him, additional, political, protection, under, church, law, even, though, many, felt, the, promise, was, insincere, letters, backing, john, arrived, from, the, pope, in, april, but, by, then, the, rebel, barons, had, organised, into, a, military, faction, they, congregated, at, northampton, in, may, and, renounced, their, feudal, ties, to, john, marching, on, london, lincoln, and, exeter, john, s, efforts, to, appear, moderate, and, conciliatory, had, been, largely, successful, but, once, the, rebels, held, london, they, attracted, a, fresh, wave, of, defectors, from, the, royalists, the, king, offered, to, submit, the, problem, to, a, committee, of, arbitration, with, the, pope, as, the, supreme, arbiter, but, this, was, not, attractive, to, the, rebels, stephen, langton, the, archbishop, of, canterbury, had, been, working, with, the, rebel, barons, on, their, demands, and, after, the, suggestion, of, papal, arbitration, failed, john, instructed, langton, to, organise, peace, talks, john, met, the, rebel, leaders, at, runnymede, a, water, meadow, on, the, south, bank, of, the, river, thames, on, 10, june, 1215, runnymede, was, a, traditional, place, for, assemblies, but, it, was, also, located, on, neutral, ground, between, the, royal, fortress, of, windsor, castle, and, the, rebel, base, at, staines, and, offered, both, sides, the, security, of, a, rendezvous, where, they, were, unlikely, to, find, themselves, at, a, military, disadvantage, here, the, rebels, presented, john, with, their, draft, demands, for, reform, the, articles, of, the, barons, stephen, langton, s, pragmatic, efforts, at, mediation, over, the, next, ten, days, turned, these, incomplete, demands, into, a, charter, capturing, the, proposed, peace, agreement, a, few, years, later, this, agreement, was, renamed, magna, carta, meaning, great, charter, by, 15, june, general, agreement, had, been, made, on, a, text, and, on, 19, june, the, rebels, renewed, their, oaths, of, loyalty, to, john, and, copies, of, the, charter, were, formally, issued, although, as, the, historian, david, carpenter, has, noted, the, charter, wasted, no, time, on, political, theory, it, went, beyond, simply, addressing, individual, baronial, complaints, and, formed, a, wider, proposal, for, political, reform, it, promised, the, protection, of, church, rights, protection, from, illegal, imprisonment, access, to, swift, justice, and, most, importantly, limitations, on, taxation, and, other, feudal, payments, to, the, crown, with, certain, forms, of, feudal, taxation, requiring, baronial, consent, it, focused, on, the, rights, of, free, men, in, particular, the, barons, the, rights, of, serfs, were, included, in, articles, 16, 20, and, 28, its, style, and, content, reflected, henry, i, s, charter, of, liberties, as, well, as, a, wider, body, of, legal, traditions, including, the, royal, charters, issued, to, towns, the, operations, of, the, church, and, baronial, courts, and, european, charters, such, as, the, statute, of, pamiers, the, magna, carta, reflected, other, legal, documents, of, its, time, in, england, and, beyond, which, made, broadly, similar, statements, of, rights, and, limitations, on, the, powers, of, the, crown, under, what, historians, later, labelled, clause, 61, or, the, security, clause, a, council, of, 25, barons, would, be, created, to, monitor, and, ensure, john, s, future, adherence, to, the, charter, if, john, did, not, conform, to, the, charter, within, 40, days, of, being, notified, of, a, transgression, by, the, council, the, 25, barons, were, empowered, by, clause, 61, to, seize, john, s, castles, and, lands, until, in, their, judgement, amends, had, been, made, men, were, to, be, compelled, to, swear, an, oath, to, assist, the, council, in, controlling, the, king, but, once, redress, had, been, made, for, any, breaches, the, king, would, continue, to, rule, as, before, charles, iii, william, prince, of, wales, charles, iii, king, in, council, starmer, ministry, l, keir, starmer, l, angela, rayner, l, the, lord, reed, the, lord, hodge, andrew, bailey, monetary, policy, committee, in, one, sense, this, was, not, unprecedented, other, kings, had, previously, conceded, the, right, of, individual, resistance, to, their, subjects, if, the, king, did, not, uphold, his, obligations, magna, carta, was, novel, in, that, it, set, up, a, formally, recognised, means, of, collectively, coercing, the, king, the, historian, wilfred, warren, argues, that, it, was, almost, inevitable, that, the, clause, would, result, in, civil, war, as, it, was, crude, in, its, methods, and, disturbing, in, its, implications, the, barons, were, trying, to, force, john, to, keep, to, the, charter, but, clause, 61, was, so, heavily, weighted, against, the, king, that, this, version, of, the, charter, could, not, survive, john, and, the, rebel, barons, did, not, trust, each, other, and, neither, side, seriously, attempted, to, implement, the, peace, accord, the, 25, barons, selected, for, the, new, council, were, all, rebels, chosen, by, the, more, extremist, barons, and, many, among, the, rebels, found, excuses, to, keep, their, forces, mobilised, disputes, began, to, emerge, between, the, royalist, faction, and, those, rebels, who, had, expected, the, charter, to, return, lands, that, had, been, confiscated, clause, 61, of, magna, carta, contained, a, commitment, from, john, that, he, would, seek, to, obtain, nothing, from, anyone, in, our, own, person, or, through, someone, else, whereby, any, of, these, grants, or, liberties, may, be, revoked, or, diminished, despite, this, the, king, appealed, to, pope, innocent, for, help, in, july, arguing, that, the, charter, compromised, the, pope, s, rights, as, john, s, feudal, lord, as, part, of, the, june, peace, deal, the, barons, were, supposed, to, surrender, london, by, 15, august, but, this, they, refused, to, do, meanwhile, instructions, from, the, pope, arrived, in, august, written, before, the, peace, accord, with, the, result, that, papal, commissioners, excommunicated, the, rebel, barons, and, suspended, langton, from, office, in, early, september, once, aware, of, the, charter, the, pope, responded, in, detail, in, a, letter, dated, 24, august, and, arriving, in, late, september, he, declared, the, charter, to, be, not, only, shameful, and, demeaning, but, also, illegal, and, unjust, since, john, had, been, forced, to, accept, it, and, accordingly, the, charter, was, null, and, void, of, all, validity, for, ever, under, threat, of, excommunication, the, king, was, not, to, observe, the, charter, nor, the, barons, try, to, enforce, it, by, then, violence, had, broken, out, between, the, two, sides, less, than, three, months, after, it, had, been, agreed, john, and, the, loyalist, barons, firmly, repudiated, the, failed, charter, the, first, barons, war, erupted, the, rebel, barons, concluded, that, peace, with, john, was, impossible, and, turned, to, philip, ii, s, son, the, future, louis, viii, for, help, offering, him, the, english, throne, the, war, soon, settled, into, a, stalemate, the, king, became, ill, and, died, on, the, night, of, 18, october, 1216, leaving, the, nine, year, old, henry, iii, as, his, heir, magna, carta, was, the, first, document, in, which, reference, is, made, to, english, and, welsh, law, alongside, one, another, including, the, principle, of, the, common, acceptance, of, the, lawful, judgement, of, peers, chapter, 56, the, return, of, lands, and, liberties, to, welshmen, if, those, lands, and, liberties, had, been, taken, by, english, and, vice, versa, without, a, law, abiding, judgement, of, their, peers, chapter, 57, the, return, of, gruffudd, ap, llywelyn, ap, iorwerth, illegitimate, son, of, llywelyn, ap, iorwerth, llywelyn, the, great, along, with, other, welsh, hostages, which, were, originally, taken, for, peace, and, good, the, preamble, to, magna, carta, includes, the, names, of, the, following, 27, ecclesiastical, and, secular, magnates, who, had, counselled, john, to, accept, its, terms, the, names, include, some, of, the, moderate, reformers, notably, archbishop, stephen, langton, and, some, of, john, s, loyal, supporters, such, as, william, marshal, earl, of, pembroke, they, are, listed, here, in, the, order, in, which, they, appear, in, the, charter, itself, the, names, of, the, twenty, five, barons, appointed, under, clause, 61, to, monitor, john, s, future, conduct, are, not, given, in, the, charter, itself, but, do, appear, in, four, early, sources, all, seemingly, based, on, a, contemporary, listing, a, late, 13th, century, collection, of, law, tracts, and, statutes, a, reading, abbey, manuscript, now, in, lambeth, palace, library, and, the, chronica, majora, and, liber, additamentorum, of, matthew, paris, the, process, of, appointment, is, not, known, but, the, names, were, drawn, almost, exclusively, from, among, john, s, more, active, opponents, they, are, listed, here, in, the, order, in, which, they, appear, in, the, original, sources, in, september, 1215, the, papal, commissioners, in, england, subdeacon, pandulf, peter, des, roches, bishop, of, winchester, and, simon, abbot, of, reading, excommunicated, the, rebels, acting, on, instructions, earlier, received, from, rome, a, letter, sent, by, the, commissioners, from, dover, on, 5, september, to, archbishop, langton, explicitly, names, nine, senior, rebel, barons, all, members, of, the, council, of, twenty, five, and, six, clerics, numbered, among, the, rebel, ranks, barons, clerics, although, the, charter, of, 1215, was, a, failure, as, a, peace, treaty, it, was, resurrected, under, the, new, government, of, the, young, henry, iii, as, a, way, of, drawing, support, away, from, the, rebel, faction, on, his, deathbed, king, john, appointed, a, council, of, thirteen, executors, to, help, henry, reclaim, the, kingdom, and, requested, that, his, son, be, placed, into, the, guardianship, of, william, marshal, one, of, the, most, famous, knights, in, england, william, knighted, the, boy, and, cardinal, guala, bicchieri, the, papal, legate, to, england, then, oversaw, his, coronation, at, gloucester, cathedral, on, 28, october, the, young, king, inherited, a, difficult, situation, with, over, half, of, england, occupied, by, the, rebels, he, had, substantial, support, though, from, guala, who, intended, to, win, the, civil, war, for, henry, and, punish, the, rebels, guala, set, about, strengthening, the, ties, between, england, and, the, papacy, starting, with, the, coronation, itself, during, which, henry, gave, homage, to, the, papacy, recognising, the, pope, as, his, feudal, lord, pope, honorius, iii, declared, that, henry, was, the, pope, s, vassal, and, ward, and, that, the, legate, had, complete, authority, to, protect, henry, and, his, kingdom, as, an, additional, measure, henry, took, the, cross, declaring, himself, a, crusader, and, thereby, entitled, to, special, protection, from, rome, the, war, was, not, going, well, for, the, loyalists, but, prince, louis, and, the, rebel, barons, were, also, finding, it, difficult, to, make, further, progress, john, s, death, had, defused, some, of, the, rebel, concerns, and, the, royal, castles, were, still, holding, out, in, the, occupied, parts, of, the, country, henry, s, government, encouraged, the, rebel, barons, to, come, back, to, his, cause, in, exchange, for, the, return, of, their, lands, and, reissued, a, version, of, the, 1215, charter, albeit, having, first, removed, some, of, the, clauses, including, those, unfavourable, to, the, papacy, and, clause, 61, which, had, set, up, the, council, of, barons, the, move, was, not, successful, and, opposition, to, henry, s, new, government, hardened, in, february, 1217, louis, set, sail, for, france, to, gather, reinforcements, in, his, absence, arguments, broke, out, between, louis, french, and, english, followers, and, cardinal, guala, declared, that, henry, s, war, against, the, rebels, was, the, equivalent, of, a, religious, crusade, this, declaration, resulted, in, a, series, of, defections, from, the, rebel, movement, and, the, tide, of, the, conflict, swung, in, henry, s, favour, louis, returned, at, the, end, of, april, but, his, northern, forces, were, defeated, by, william, marshal, at, the, battle, of, lincoln, in, may, meanwhile, support, for, louis, campaign, was, diminishing, in, france, and, he, concluded, that, the, war, in, england, was, lost, he, negotiated, terms, with, cardinal, guala, under, which, louis, would, renounce, his, claim, to, the, english, throne, in, return, his, followers, would, be, given, back, their, lands, any, sentences, of, excommunication, would, be, lifted, and, henry, s, government, would, promise, to, enforce, the, charter, of, the, previous, year, the, proposed, agreement, soon, began, to, unravel, amid, claims, from, some, loyalists, that, it, was, too, generous, towards, the, rebels, particularly, the, clergy, who, had, joined, the, rebellion, in, the, absence, of, a, settlement, louis, stayed, in, london, with, his, remaining, forces, hoping, for, the, arrival, of, reinforcements, from, france, when, the, expected, fleet, arrived, in, august, it, was, intercepted, and, defeated, by, loyalists, at, the, battle, of, sandwich, louis, entered, into, fresh, peace, negotiations, the, factions, came, to, agreement, on, the, final, treaty, of, lambeth, also, known, as, the, treaty, of, kingston, on, 12, and, 13, september, 1217, the, treaty, was, similar, to, the, first, peace, offer, but, excluded, the, rebel, clergy, whose, lands, and, appointments, remained, forfeit, it, included, a, promise, that, louis, followers, would, be, allowed, to, enjoy, their, traditional, liberties, and, customs, referring, back, to, the, charter, of, 1216, louis, left, england, as, agreed, he, joined, the, albigensian, crusade, in, the, south, of, france, bringing, the, war, to, an, end, a, great, council, was, called, in, october, and, november, to, take, stock, of, the, post, war, situation, this, council, is, thought, to, have, formulated, and, issued, the, charter, of, 1217, the, charter, resembled, that, of, 1216, although, some, additional, clauses, were, added, to, protect, the, rights, of, the, barons, over, their, feudal, subjects, and, the, restrictions, on, the, crown, s, ability, to, levy, taxation, were, watered, down, there, remained, a, range, of, disagreements, about, the, management, of, the, royal, forests, which, involved, a, special, legal, system, that, had, resulted, in, a, source, of, considerable, royal, revenue, complaints, existed, over, both, the, implementation, of, these, courts, and, the, geographic, boundaries, of, the, royal, forests, a, complementary, charter, the, charter, of, the, forest, was, created, pardoning, existing, forest, offences, imposing, new, controls, over, the, forest, courts, and, establishing, a, review, of, the, forest, boundaries, to, distinguish, the, two, charters, the, term, magna, carta, libertatum, the, great, charter, of, liberties, was, used, by, the, scribes, to, refer, to, the, larger, document, which, in, time, became, known, simply, as, magna, carta, magna, carta, became, increasingly, embedded, into, english, political, life, during, henry, iii, s, minority, as, the, king, grew, older, his, government, slowly, began, to, recover, from, the, civil, war, regaining, control, of, the, counties, and, beginning, to, raise, revenue, once, again, taking, care, not, to, overstep, the, terms, of, the, charters, henry, remained, a, minor, and, his, government, s, legal, ability, to, make, permanently, binding, decisions, on, his, behalf, was, limited, in, 1223, the, tensions, over, the, status, of, the, charters, became, clear, in, the, royal, court, when, henry, s, government, attempted, to, reassert, its, rights, over, its, properties, and, revenues, in, the, counties, facing, resistance, from, many, communities, that, argued, if, sometimes, incorrectly, that, the, charters, protected, the, new, arrangements, this, resistance, resulted, in, an, argument, between, archbishop, langton, and, william, brewer, over, whether, the, king, had, any, duty, to, fulfil, the, terms, of, the, charters, given, that, he, had, been, forced, to, agree, to, them, on, this, occasion, henry, gave, oral, assurances, that, he, considered, himself, bound, by, the, charters, enabling, a, royal, inquiry, into, the, situation, in, the, counties, to, progress, in, 1225, the, question, of, henry, s, commitment, to, the, charters, re, emerged, when, louis, viii, of, france, invaded, henry, s, remaining, provinces, in, france, poitou, and, gascony, henry, s, army, in, poitou, was, under, resourced, and, the, province, quickly, fell, it, became, clear, that, gascony, would, also, fall, unless, reinforcements, were, sent, from, england, in, early, 1225, a, great, council, approved, a, tax, of, 40, 000, to, dispatch, an, army, which, quickly, retook, gascony, in, exchange, for, agreeing, to, support, henry, the, barons, demanded, that, the, king, reissue, magna, carta, and, the, charter, of, the, forest, the, content, was, almost, identical, to, the, 1217, versions, but, in, the, new, versions, the, king, declared, that, the, charters, were, issued, of, his, own, spontaneous, and, free, will, and, confirmed, them, with, the, royal, seal, giving, the, new, great, charter, and, the, charter, of, the, forest, of, 1225, much, more, authority, than, the, previous, versions, the, barons, anticipated, that, the, king, would, act, in, accordance, with, these, charters, subject, to, the, law, and, moderated, by, the, advice, of, the, nobility, uncertainty, continued, and, in, 1227, when, he, was, declared, of, age, and, able, to, rule, independently, henry, announced, that, future, charters, had, to, be, issued, under, his, own, seal, this, brought, into, question, the, validity, of, the, previous, charters, issued, during, his, minority, and, henry, actively, threatened, to, overturn, the, charter, of, the, forest, unless, the, taxes, promised, in, return, for, it, were, actually, paid, in, 1253, henry, confirmed, the, charters, once, again, in, exchange, for, taxation, henry, placed, a, symbolic, emphasis, on, rebuilding, royal, authority, but, his, rule, was, relatively, circumscribed, by, magna, carta, he, generally, acted, within, the, terms, of, the, charters, which, prevented, the, crown, from, taking, extrajudicial, action, against, the, barons, including, the, fines, and, expropriations, that, had, been, common, under, his, father, john, the, charters, did, not, address, the, sensitive, issues, of, the, appointment, of, royal, advisers, and, the, distribution, of, patronage, and, they, lacked, any, means, of, enforcement, if, the, king, chose, to, ignore, them, the, inconsistency, with, which, he, applied, the, charters, over, the, course, of, his, rule, alienated, many, barons, even, those, within, his, own, faction, despite, the, various, charters, the, provision, of, royal, justice, was, inconsistent, and, driven, by, the, needs, of, immediate, politics, sometimes, action, would, be, taken, to, address, a, legitimate, baronial, complaint, while, on, other, occasions, the, problem, would, simply, be, ignored, the, royal, courts, which, toured, the, country, to, provide, justice, at, the, local, level, typically, for, lesser, barons, and, the, gentry, claiming, grievances, against, major, lords, had, little, power, allowing, the, major, barons, to, dominate, the, local, justice, system, henry, s, rule, became, lax, and, careless, resulting, in, a, reduction, in, royal, authority, in, the, provinces, and, ultimately, the, collapse, of, his, authority, at, court, in, 1258, a, group, of, barons, seized, power, from, henry, in, a, coup, d, tat, citing, the, need, to, strictly, enforce, magna, carta, and, the, charter, of, the, forest, creating, a, new, baronial, led, government, to, advance, reform, through, the, provisions, of, oxford, the, barons, were, not, militarily, powerful, enough, to, win, a, decisive, victory, and, instead, appealed, to, louis, ix, of, france, in, 1263, 1264, to, arbitrate, on, their, proposed, reforms, the, reformist, barons, argued, their, case, based, on, magna, carta, suggesting, that, it, was, inviolable, under, english, law, and, that, the, king, had, broken, its, terms, louis, came, down, firmly, in, favour, of, henry, but, the, french, arbitration, failed, to, achieve, peace, as, the, rebellious, barons, refused, to, accept, the, verdict, england, slipped, back, into, the, second, barons, war, which, was, won, by, henry, s, son, the, lord, edward, edward, also, invoked, magna, carta, in, advancing, his, cause, arguing, that, the, reformers, had, taken, matters, too, far, and, were, themselves, acting, against, magna, carta, in, a, conciliatory, gesture, after, the, barons, had, been, defeated, in, 1267, henry, issued, the, statute, of, marlborough, which, included, a, fresh, commitment, to, observe, the, terms, of, magna, carta, the, following, 65, individuals, were, witnesses, to, the, 1225, issue, of, magna, carta, named, in, the, order, in, which, they, appear, in, the, charter, itself, king, edward, i, reissued, the, charters, of, 1225, in, 1297, in, return, for, a, new, tax, it, is, this, version, which, remains, in, statute, today, although, with, most, articles, now, repealed, the, confirmatio, cartarum, confirmation, of, charters, was, issued, in, norman, french, by, edward, i, in, 1297, edward, needing, money, had, taxed, the, nobility, and, they, had, armed, themselves, against, him, forcing, edward, to, issue, his, confirmation, of, magna, carta, and, the, forest, charter, to, avoid, civil, war, the, nobles, had, sought, to, add, another, document, the, de, tallagio, to, magna, carta, edward, i, s, government, was, not, prepared, to, concede, this, they, agreed, to, the, issuing, of, the, confirmatio, confirming, the, previous, charters, and, confirming, the, principle, that, taxation, should, be, by, consent, although, the, precise, manner, of, that, consent, was, not, laid, down, a, passage, mandates, that, copies, shall, be, distributed, in, cathedral, churches, throughout, our, realm, there, to, remain, and, shall, be, read, before, the, people, two, times, by, the, year, hence, the, permanent, installation, of, a, copy, in, salisbury, cathedral, in, the, confirmation, s, second, article, it, is, confirmed, that, if, any, judgement, be, given, from, henceforth, contrary, to, the, points, of, the, charters, aforesaid, by, the, justices, or, by, any, other, our, ministers, that, hold, plea, before, them, against, the, points, of, the, charters, it, shall, be, undone, and, holden, for, nought, with, the, reconfirmation, of, the, charters, in, 1300, an, additional, document, was, granted, the, articuli, super, cartas, the, articles, upon, the, charters, it, was, composed, of, 17, articles, and, sought, in, part, to, deal, with, the, problem, of, enforcing, the, charters, magna, carta, and, the, forest, charter, were, to, be, issued, to, the, sheriff, of, each, county, and, should, be, read, four, times, a, year, at, the, meetings, of, the, county, courts, each, county, should, have, a, committee, of, three, men, who, could, hear, complaints, about, violations, of, the, charters, pope, clement, v, continued, the, papal, policy, of, supporting, monarchs, who, ruled, by, divine, grace, against, any, claims, in, magna, carta, which, challenged, the, king, s, rights, and, annulled, the, confirmatio, cartarum, in, 1305, edward, i, interpreted, clement, v, s, papal, bull, annulling, the, confirmatio, cartarum, as, effectively, applying, to, the, articuli, super, cartas, although, the, latter, was, not, specifically, mentioned, in, 1306, edward, i, took, the, opportunity, given, by, the, pope, s, backing, to, reassert, forest, law, over, large, areas, which, had, been, disafforested, both, edward, and, the, pope, were, accused, by, some, contemporary, chroniclers, of, perjury, and, it, was, suggested, by, robert, mcnair, scott, that, robert, the, bruce, refused, to, make, peace, with, edward, i, s, son, edward, ii, in, 1312, with, the, justification, how, shall, the, king, of, england, keep, faith, with, me, since, he, does, not, observe, the, sworn, promises, made, to, his, liege, men, the, great, charter, was, referred, to, in, legal, cases, throughout, the, medieval, period, for, example, in, 1226, the, knights, of, lincolnshire, argued, that, their, local, sheriff, was, changing, customary, practice, regarding, the, local, courts, contrary, to, their, liberty, which, they, ought, to, have, by, the, charter, of, the, lord, king, in, practice, cases, were, not, brought, against, the, king, for, breach, of, magna, carta, and, the, forest, charter, but, it, was, possible, to, bring, a, case, against, the, king, s, officers, such, as, his, sheriffs, using, the, argument, that, the, king, s, officers, were, acting, contrary, to, liberties, granted, by, the, king, in, the, charters, in, addition, medieval, cases, referred, to, the, clauses, in, magna, carta, which, dealt, with, specific, issues, such, as, wardship, and, dower, debt, collection, and, keeping, rivers, free, for, navigation, even, in, the, 13th, century, some, clauses, of, magna, carta, rarely, appeared, in, legal, cases, either, because, the, issues, concerned, were, no, longer, relevant, or, because, magna, carta, had, been, superseded, by, more, relevant, legislation, by, 1350, half, the, clauses, of, magna, carta, were, no, longer, actively, used, during, the, reign, of, king, edward, iii, six, measures, later, known, as, the, six, statutes, were, passed, between, 1331, and, 1369, they, sought, to, clarify, certain, parts, of, the, charters, in, particular, the, third, statute, in, 1354, redefined, clause, 29, with, free, man, becoming, no, man, of, whatever, estate, or, condition, he, may, be, and, introduced, the, phrase, due, process, of, law, for, lawful, judgement, of, his, peers, or, the, law, of, the, land, between, the, 13th, and, 15th, centuries, magna, carta, was, reconfirmed, 32, times, according, to, sir, edward, coke, and, possibly, as, many, as, 45, times, often, the, first, item, of, parliamentary, business, was, a, public, reading, and, reaffirmation, of, the, charter, and, as, in, the, previous, century, parliaments, often, exacted, confirmation, of, it, from, the, monarch, the, charter, was, confirmed, in, 1423, by, king, henry, vi, by, the, mid, 15th, century, magna, carta, ceased, to, occupy, a, central, role, in, english, political, life, as, monarchs, reasserted, authority, and, powers, which, had, been, challenged, in, the, 100, years, after, edward, i, s, reign, the, great, charter, remained, a, text, for, lawyers, particularly, as, a, protector, of, property, rights, and, became, more, widely, read, than, ever, as, printed, versions, circulated, and, levels, of, literacy, increased, during, the, 16th, century, the, interpretation, of, magna, carta, and, the, first, barons, war, shifted, henry, vii, took, power, at, the, end, of, the, turbulent, wars, of, the, roses, followed, by, henry, viii, and, extensive, propaganda, under, both, rulers, promoted, the, legitimacy, of, the, regime, the, illegitimacy, of, any, sort, of, rebellion, against, royal, power, and, the, priority, of, supporting, the, crown, in, its, arguments, with, the, papacy, tudor, historians, rediscovered, the, barnwell, chronicler, who, was, more, favourable, to, king, john, than, other, 13th, century, texts, and, as, historian, ralph, turner, describes, they, viewed, king, john, in, a, positive, light, as, a, hero, struggling, against, the, papacy, showing, little, sympathy, for, the, great, charter, or, the, rebel, barons, pro, catholic, demonstrations, during, the, 1536, uprising, cited, magna, carta, accusing, the, king, of, not, giving, it, sufficient, respect, the, first, mechanically, printed, edition, of, magna, carta, was, probably, the, magna, carta, cum, aliis, antiquis, statutis, of, 1508, by, richard, pynson, although, the, early, printed, versions, of, the, 16th, century, incorrectly, attributed, the, origins, of, magna, carta, to, henry, iii, and, 1225, rather, than, to, john, and, 1215, and, accordingly, worked, from, the, later, text, an, abridged, english, language, edition, was, published, by, john, rastell, in, 1527, thomas, berthelet, pynson, s, successor, as, the, royal, printer, during, 1530, 1547, printed, an, edition, of, the, text, along, with, other, ancient, statutes, in, 1531, and, 1540, in, 1534, george, ferrers, published, the, first, unabridged, english, language, edition, of, magna, carta, dividing, the, charter, into, 37, numbered, clauses, the, mid, sixteenth, century, funerary, monument, sir, rowland, hill, of, soulton, placed, in, st, stephens, wallbroke, included, a, full, statue, of, the, tudor, statesman, and, judge, holding, a, copy, of, magna, carta, hill, was, a, mercer, and, a, lord, mayor, of, london, both, of, these, statuses, were, shared, with, serlo, the, mercer, who, was, a, negotiator, and, enforcer, of, magna, carta, the, original, monument, was, lost, in, the, great, fire, of, london, but, it, was, restated, on, a, 110, foot, tall, column, on, his, family, s, estates, in, shropshire, at, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, there, was, an, upsurge, in, antiquarian, interest, in, magna, carta, in, england, legal, historians, concluded, that, there, was, a, set, of, ancient, english, customs, and, laws, which, had, been, temporarily, overthrown, by, the, norman, invasion, of, 1066, and, been, recovered, in, 1215, and, recorded, in, magna, carta, which, in, turn, gave, authority, to, important, 16th, century, legal, principles, modern, historians, regard, this, narrative, as, fundamentally, incorrect, and, many, refer, to, it, as, a, myth, the, antiquarian, william, lambarde, published, what, he, believed, were, the, anglo, saxon, and, norman, law, codes, tracing, the, origins, of, the, 16th, century, english, parliament, back, to, this, period, but, he, misinterpreted, the, dates, of, many, documents, concerned, francis, bacon, argued, that, clause, 39, of, magna, carta, was, the, basis, of, the, 16th, century, jury, system, and, judicial, processes, antiquarians, robert, beale, james, morice, and, richard, cosin, argued, that, magna, carta, was, a, statement, of, liberty, and, a, fundamental, supreme, law, empowering, english, government, those, who, questioned, these, conclusions, including, the, member, of, parliament, arthur, hall, faced, sanctions, in, the, early, 17th, century, magna, carta, became, increasingly, important, as, a, political, document, in, arguments, over, the, authority, of, the, english, monarchy, james, i, and, charles, i, both, propounded, greater, authority, for, the, crown, justified, by, the, doctrine, of, the, divine, right, of, kings, and, magna, carta, was, cited, extensively, by, their, opponents, to, challenge, the, monarchy, magna, carta, it, was, argued, recognised, and, protected, the, liberty, of, individual, englishmen, made, the, king, subject, to, the, common, law, of, the, land, formed, the, origin, of, the, trial, by, jury, system, and, acknowledged, the, ancient, origins, of, parliament, because, of, magna, carta, and, this, ancient, constitution, an, english, monarch, was, unable, to, alter, these, long, standing, english, customs, although, the, arguments, based, on, magna, carta, were, historically, inaccurate, they, nonetheless, carried, symbolic, power, as, the, charter, had, immense, significance, during, this, period, antiquarians, such, as, sir, henry, spelman, described, it, as, the, most, majestic, and, a, sacrosanct, anchor, to, english, liberties, sir, edward, coke, was, a, leader, in, using, magna, carta, as, a, political, tool, during, this, period, still, working, from, the, 1225, version, of, the, text, the, first, printed, copy, of, the, 1215, charter, only, emerged, in, 1610, coke, spoke, and, wrote, about, magna, carta, repeatedly, his, work, was, challenged, at, the, time, by, lord, ellesmere, and, modern, historians, such, as, ralph, turner, and, claire, breay, have, critiqued, coke, as, misconstruing, the, original, charter, anachronistically, and, uncritically, and, taking, a, very, selective, approach, to, his, analysis, more, sympathetically, j, c, holt, noted, that, the, history, of, the, charters, had, already, become, distorted, by, the, time, coke, was, carrying, out, his, work, in, 1621, a, bill, was, presented, to, parliament, to, renew, magna, carta, although, this, bill, failed, lawyer, john, selden, argued, during, darnell, s, case, in, 1627, that, the, right, of, habeas, corpus, was, backed, by, magna, carta, coke, supported, the, petition, of, right, in, 1628, which, cited, magna, carta, in, its, preamble, attempting, to, extend, the, provisions, and, to, make, them, binding, on, the, judiciary, the, monarchy, responded, by, arguing, that, the, historical, legal, situation, was, much, less, clear, cut, than, was, being, claimed, restricted, the, activities, of, antiquarians, arrested, coke, for, treason, and, suppressed, his, proposed, book, on, magna, carta, charles, initially, did, not, agree, to, the, petition, of, right, and, refused, to, confirm, magna, carta, in, any, way, that, would, reduce, his, independence, as, king, england, descended, into, civil, war, in, the, 1640s, resulting, in, charles, i, s, execution, in, 1649, under, the, republic, that, followed, some, questioned, whether, magna, carta, an, agreement, with, a, monarch, was, still, relevant, an, anti, cromwellian, pamphlet, published, in, 1660, the, english, devil, said, that, the, nation, had, been, compelled, to, submit, to, this, tyrant, nol, or, be, cut, off, by, him, nothing, but, a, word, and, a, blow, his, will, was, his, law, tell, him, of, magna, carta, he, would, lay, his, hand, on, his, sword, and, cry, magna, farta, in, a, 2005, speech, the, lord, chief, justice, of, england, and, wales, lord, woolf, repeated, the, claim, that, cromwell, had, referred, to, magna, carta, as, magna, farta, the, radical, groups, that, flourished, during, this, period, held, differing, opinions, of, magna, carta, the, levellers, rejected, history, and, law, as, presented, by, their, contemporaries, holding, instead, to, an, anti, normanism, viewpoint, john, lilburne, for, example, argued, that, magna, carta, contained, only, some, of, the, freedoms, that, had, supposedly, existed, under, the, anglo, saxons, before, being, crushed, by, the, norman, yoke, the, leveller, richard, overton, described, the, charter, as, a, beggarly, thing, containing, many, marks, of, intolerable, bondage, both, saw, magna, carta, as, a, useful, declaration, of, liberties, that, could, be, used, against, governments, they, disagreed, with, gerrard, winstanley, the, leader, of, the, more, extreme, diggers, stated, the, best, lawes, that, england, hath, were, got, by, our, forefathers, importunate, petitioning, unto, the, kings, that, still, were, their, task, masters, and, yet, these, best, laws, are, yoaks, and, manicles, tying, one, sort, of, people, to, be, slaves, to, another, clergy, and, gentry, have, got, their, freedom, but, the, common, people, still, are, and, have, been, left, servants, to, work, for, them, the, first, attempt, at, a, proper, historiography, was, undertaken, by, robert, brady, who, refuted, the, supposed, antiquity, of, parliament, and, belief, in, the, immutable, continuity, of, the, law, brady, realised, that, the, liberties, of, the, charter, were, limited, and, argued, that, the, liberties, were, the, grant, of, the, king, by, putting, magna, carta, in, historical, context, he, cast, doubt, on, its, contemporary, political, relevance, his, historical, understanding, did, not, survive, the, glorious, revolution, which, according, to, the, historian, j, g, a, pocock, marked, a, setback, for, the, course, of, english, historiography, according, to, the, whig, interpretation, of, history, the, glorious, revolution, was, an, example, of, the, reclaiming, of, ancient, liberties, reinforced, with, lockean, concepts, the, whigs, believed, england, s, constitution, to, be, a, social, contract, based, on, documents, such, as, magna, carta, the, petition, of, right, and, the, bill, of, rights, the, english, liberties, 1680, in, later, versions, often, british, liberties, by, the, whig, propagandist, henry, care, d, 1688, was, a, cheap, polemical, book, that, was, influential, and, much, reprinted, in, the, american, colonies, as, well, as, britain, and, made, magna, carta, central, to, the, history, and, the, contemporary, legitimacy, of, its, subject, ideas, about, the, nature, of, law, in, general, were, beginning, to, change, in, 1716, the, septennial, act, was, passed, which, had, a, number, of, consequences, first, it, showed, that, parliament, no, longer, considered, its, previous, statutes, unassailable, as, it, provided, for, a, maximum, parliamentary, term, of, seven, years, whereas, the, triennial, act, 1694, enacted, less, than, a, quarter, of, a, century, previously, had, provided, for, a, maximum, term, of, three, years, it, also, greatly, extended, the, powers, of, parliament, under, this, new, constitution, monarchical, absolutism, was, replaced, by, parliamentary, supremacy, it, was, quickly, realised, that, magna, carta, stood, in, the, same, relation, to, the, king, in, parliament, as, it, had, to, the, king, without, parliament, this, supremacy, would, be, challenged, by, the, likes, of, granville, sharp, sharp, regarded, magna, carta, as, a, fundamental, part, of, the, constitution, and, maintained, that, it, would, be, treason, to, repeal, any, part, of, it, he, also, held, that, the, charter, prohibited, slavery, sir, william, blackstone, published, a, critical, edition, of, the, 1215, charter, in, 1759, and, gave, it, the, numbering, system, still, used, today, in, 1763, member, of, parliament, john, wilkes, was, arrested, for, writing, an, inflammatory, pamphlet, no, 45, 23, april, 1763, he, cited, magna, carta, continually, lord, camden, denounced, the, treatment, of, wilkes, as, a, contravention, of, magna, carta, thomas, paine, in, his, rights, of, man, would, disregard, magna, carta, and, the, bill, of, rights, on, the, grounds, that, they, were, not, a, written, constitution, devised, by, elected, representatives, when, english, colonists, left, for, the, new, world, they, brought, royal, charters, that, established, the, colonies, the, massachusetts, bay, company, charter, for, example, stated, that, the, colonists, would, have, and, enjoy, all, liberties, and, immunities, of, free, and, natural, subjects, the, virginia, charter, of, 1606, which, was, largely, drafted, by, sir, edward, coke, stated, that, the, colonists, would, have, the, same, liberties, franchises, and, immunities, as, people, born, in, england, the, massachusetts, body, of, liberties, contained, similarities, to, clause, 29, of, magna, carta, when, drafting, it, the, massachusetts, general, court, viewed, magna, carta, as, the, chief, embodiment, of, english, common, law, the, other, colonies, would, follow, their, example, in, 1638, maryland, sought, to, recognise, magna, carta, as, part, of, the, law, of, the, province, but, the, request, was, denied, by, charles, i, in, 1687, william, penn, published, the, excellent, privilege, of, liberty, and, property, being, the, birth, right, of, the, free, born, subjects, of, england, which, contained, the, first, copy, of, magna, carta, printed, on, american, soil, penn, s, comments, reflected, coke, s, indicating, a, belief, that, magna, carta, was, a, fundamental, law, the, colonists, drew, on, english, law, books, leading, them, to, an, anachronistic, interpretation, of, magna, carta, believing, that, it, guaranteed, trial, by, jury, and, habeas, corpus, the, development, of, parliamentary, supremacy, in, the, british, isles, did, not, constitutionally, affect, the, thirteen, colonies, which, retained, an, adherence, to, english, common, law, but, it, directly, affected, the, relationship, between, britain, and, the, colonies, when, american, colonists, fought, against, britain, they, were, fighting, not, so, much, for, new, freedom, but, to, preserve, liberties, and, rights, that, they, believed, to, be, enshrined, in, magna, carta, in, the, late, 18th, century, the, united, states, constitution, became, the, supreme, law, of, the, land, recalling, the, manner, in, which, magna, carta, had, come, to, be, regarded, as, fundamental, law, the, constitution, s, fifth, amendment, guarantees, that, no, person, shall, be, deprived, of, life, liberty, or, property, without, due, process, of, law, a, phrase, that, was, derived, from, magna, carta, in, addition, the, constitution, included, a, similar, writ, in, the, suspension, clause, article, 1, section, 9, the, privilege, of, the, writ, of, habeas, corpus, shall, not, be, suspended, unless, when, in, cases, of, rebellion, or, invasion, the, public, safety, may, require, it, each, of, these, proclaim, that, no, person, may, be, imprisoned, or, detained, without, evidence, that, he, or, she, committed, a, crime, the, ninth, amendment, states, that, the, enumeration, in, the, constitution, of, certain, rights, shall, not, be, construed, to, deny, or, disparage, others, retained, by, the, people, the, writers, of, the, u, s, constitution, wished, to, ensure, that, the, rights, they, already, held, such, as, those, that, they, believed, were, provided, by, magna, carta, would, be, preserved, unless, explicitly, curtailed, the, u, s, supreme, court, has, explicitly, referenced, edward, coke, s, analysis, of, magna, carta, as, an, antecedent, of, the, sixth, amendment, s, right, to, a, speedy, trial, initially, the, whig, interpretation, of, magna, carta, and, its, role, in, constitutional, history, remained, dominant, during, the, 19th, century, the, historian, william, stubbs, s, constitutional, history, of, england, published, in, the, 1870s, formed, the, high, water, mark, of, this, view, stubbs, argued, that, magna, carta, had, been, a, major, step, in, the, shaping, of, the, english, nation, and, he, believed, that, the, barons, at, runnymede, in, 1215, were, not, just, representing, the, nobility, but, the, people, of, england, as, a, whole, standing, up, to, a, tyrannical, ruler, in, the, form, of, king, john, this, view, of, magna, carta, began, to, recede, the, late, victorian, jurist, and, historian, frederic, william, maitland, provided, an, alternative, academic, history, in, 1899, which, began, to, return, magna, carta, to, its, historical, roots, in, 1904, edward, jenks, published, an, article, entitled, the, myth, of, magna, carta, which, undermined, the, previously, accepted, view, of, magna, carta, historians, such, as, albert, pollard, agreed, with, jenks, in, concluding, that, edward, coke, had, largely, invented, the, myth, of, magna, carta, in, the, 17th, century, these, historians, argued, that, the, 1215, charter, had, not, referred, to, liberty, for, the, people, at, large, but, rather, to, the, protection, of, baronial, rights, this, view, also, became, popular, in, wider, circles, and, in, 1930, sellar, and, yeatman, published, their, parody, on, english, history, 1066, and, all, that, in, which, they, mocked, the, supposed, importance, of, magna, carta, and, its, promises, of, universal, liberty, magna, charter, was, therefore, the, chief, cause, of, democracy, in, england, and, thus, a, good, thing, for, everyone, except, the, common, people, in, many, literary, representations, of, the, medieval, past, however, magna, carta, remained, a, foundation, of, english, national, identity, some, authors, used, the, medieval, roots, of, the, document, as, an, argument, to, preserve, the, social, status, quo, while, others, pointed, to, magna, carta, to, challenge, perceived, economic, injustices, the, baronial, order, of, magna, charta, was, formed, in, 1898, to, promote, the, ancient, principles, and, values, felt, to, be, displayed, in, magna, carta, the, legal, profession, in, england, and, the, united, states, continued, to, hold, magna, carta, in, high, esteem, they, were, instrumental, in, forming, the, magna, carta, society, in, 1922, to, protect, the, meadows, at, runnymede, from, development, in, the, 1920s, and, in, 1957, the, american, bar, association, erected, the, magna, carta, memorial, at, runnymede, the, prominent, lawyer, lord, denning, described, magna, carta, in, 1956, as, the, greatest, constitutional, document, of, all, times, the, foundation, of, the, freedom, of, the, individual, against, the, arbitrary, authority, of, the, despot, radicals, such, as, sir, francis, burdett, believed, that, magna, carta, could, not, be, repealed, but, in, the, 19th, century, clauses, which, were, obsolete, or, had, been, superseded, began, to, be, repealed, the, repeal, of, clause, 26, in, 1829, by, the, offences, against, the, person, act, 1828, 9, geo, 4, c, 31, s, 1, was, the, first, time, a, clause, of, magna, carta, was, repealed, over, the, next, 140, years, nearly, the, whole, of, magna, carta, 1297, as, statute, was, repealed, leaving, just, clauses, 1, 9, and, 29, still, in, force, in, england, and, wales, after, 1969, most, of, the, clauses, were, repealed, in, england, and, wales, by, the, statute, law, revision, act, 1863, and, in, modern, northern, ireland, and, also, in, the, modern, republic, of, ireland, by, the, statute, law, ireland, revision, act, 1872, many, later, attempts, to, draft, constitutional, forms, of, government, trace, their, lineage, back, to, magna, carta, the, british, dominions, australia, and, new, zealand, canada, except, quebec, and, formerly, the, union, of, south, africa, and, southern, rhodesia, reflected, the, influence, of, magna, carta, in, their, laws, and, the, charter, s, effects, can, be, seen, in, the, laws, of, other, states, that, evolved, from, the, british, empire, magna, carta, continues, to, have, a, powerful, iconic, status, in, british, society, being, cited, by, politicians, and, lawyers, in, support, of, constitutional, positions, its, perceived, guarantee, of, trial, by, jury, and, other, civil, liberties, for, example, led, to, tony, benn, s, reference, to, the, debate, in, 2008, over, whether, to, increase, the, maximum, time, terrorism, suspects, could, be, held, without, charge, from, 28, to, 42, days, as, the, day, magna, carta, was, repealed, although, rarely, invoked, in, court, in, the, modern, era, in, 2012, the, occupy, london, protestors, attempted, to, use, magna, carta, in, resisting, their, eviction, from, st, paul, s, churchyard, by, the, city, of, london, in, his, judgment, the, master, of, the, rolls, gave, this, short, shrift, noting, somewhat, drily, that, although, clause, 29, was, considered, by, many, the, foundation, of, the, rule, of, law, in, england, he, did, not, consider, it, directly, relevant, to, the, case, and, that, the, two, other, surviving, clauses, ironically, concerned, the, rights, of, the, church, and, the, city, of, london, and, could, not, help, the, defendants, magna, carta, carries, little, legal, weight, in, modern, britain, as, most, of, its, clauses, have, been, repealed, and, relevant, rights, ensured, by, other, statutes, but, the, historian, james, holt, remarks, that, the, survival, of, the, 1215, charter, in, national, life, is, a, reflexion, of, the, continuous, development, of, english, law, and, administration, and, symbolic, of, the, many, struggles, between, authority, and, the, law, over, the, centuries, the, historian, w, l, warren, has, observed, that, many, who, knew, little, and, cared, less, about, the, content, of, the, charter, have, in, nearly, all, ages, invoked, its, name, and, with, good, cause, for, it, meant, more, than, it, said, it, also, remains, a, topic, of, great, interest, to, historians, natalie, fryde, characterised, the, charter, as, one, of, the, holiest, of, cows, in, english, medieval, history, with, the, debates, over, its, interpretation, and, meaning, unlikely, to, end, the, majority, of, contemporary, historians, however, see, the, interpretation, of, the, charter, as, a, unique, and, early, charter, of, legal, rights, as, a, myth, that, was, created, centuries, later, in, many, ways, still, a, sacred, text, magna, carta, is, generally, considered, part, of, the, uncodified, constitution, of, the, united, kingdom, in, a, 2005, speech, the, lord, chief, justice, of, england, and, wales, lord, woolf, described, it, as, the, first, of, a, series, of, instruments, that, now, are, recognised, as, having, a, special, constitutional, status, magna, carta, was, reprinted, in, new, zealand, in, 1881, as, one, of, the, imperial, acts, in, force, there, clause, 29, of, the, document, remains, in, force, as, part, of, new, zealand, law, the, document, also, continues, to, be, honoured, in, the, united, states, as, an, antecedent, of, the, united, states, constitution, and, bill, of, rights, in, 1976, the, uk, lent, one, of, four, surviving, originals, of, the, 1215, magna, carta, to, the, united, states, for, their, bicentennial, celebrations, and, also, donated, an, ornate, display, case, for, it, the, original, was, returned, after, one, year, but, a, replica, and, the, case, are, still, on, display, in,

them, still, survive, the, documents, were, written, in, heavily, abbreviated, medieval, latin, in, clear, handwriting, using, quill, pens, on, sheets, of, parchment, made, from, sheep, skin, approximately, 15, by, 20, inches, 380, by, 510, mm, across, they, were, sealed, with, the, royal, great, seal, by, an, official, called, the, spigurnel, equipped, with, a, special, seal, press, using, beeswax, and, resin, there, were, no, signatures, on, the, charter, of, 1215, and, the, barons, present, did, not, attach, their, own, seals, to, it, the, text, was, not, divided, into,

of, 1215, were, issued, by, the, royal, chancery, during, that, year, seven, in, the, first, tranche, distributed, on, 24, june, and, another, six, later, they, were, sent, to, county, sheriffs, and, bishops, who, were, probably, charged, for, the, privilege, slight, variations, exist, between, the, surviving, copies, and, there, was, probably, no, single, master, copy, of, these, documents, only, four, survive, all, held, in, england, two, now, at, the, british, library, one, at, salisbury, cathedral, and, one, the, property, of, lincoln, cathedral, on, permanent, loan, to, lincoln, castle, each, of, these, versions, is, slightly, different, in, size, and, text, and, each, is, considered, by, historians, to, be, equally, authoritative, the, two, 1215, charters, held, by, the, british,

humphrey, wyems, a, london, lawyer, who, may, have, discovered, it, in, a, tailor, s, shop, and, who, gave, it, to, cotton, in, january, 1629, the, second, was, found, in, dover, castle, in, 1630, by, sir, edward, dering, the, dering, charter, was, traditionally, thought, to, be, the, copy, sent, in, 1215, to, the, cinque, ports, but, in, 2015, the, historian, david, carpenter, argued, that, it, was, more, probably, that, sent, to, canterbury, cathedral, as, its, text, was, identical, to, a, transcription, made, from, the, cathedral, s, copy, of, the, 1215, charter, in, the, 1290s, this, copy, was, damaged, in, the, cotton, library, fire, of, 1731, when, its, seal, was, badly, melted, the, parchment, was, somewhat, shrivelled, but, otherwise, relatively, unscathed, an, engraved,

illegible, to, the, naked, eye, this, is, the, only, surviving, 1215, copy, still, to, have, its, great, seal, attached, lincoln, cathedral, s, copy, has, been, held, by, the, county, since, 1215, it, was, displayed, in, the, common, chamber, in, the, cathedral, before, being, moved, to, another, building, in, 1846, between, 1939, and, 1940, it, was, displayed, in, the, british, pavilion, at, the, 1939, world, fair, in, new, york, city, and, at, the, library, of, congress, when, the, second, world, war, broke, out, winston, churchill, wanted, to, give, the, charter, to, the, american, people, hoping, that, this, would, encourage, the, united, states, then, neutral, to, enter, the, war, against, the, axis, powers, but, the, cathedral, was, unwilling, and, the, plans, were, dropped, after, december, 1941, the, copy, was, stored, in, fort, knox, kentucky, for, safety, before, being, put, on, display, again, in, 1944, and, returned, to, lincoln, cathedral, in, early, 1946, it, was, put,

by, the, cathedral, in, 1812, it, has, remained, in, salisbury, throughout, its, history, except, when, being, taken, off, site, for, restoration, work, it, is, possibly, the, best, preserved, of, the, four, although, small, pin, holes, can, be, seen, in, the, parchment, from, where, it, was, once, pinned, up, the, handwriting, on, this, version, is, different, from, that, of, the, other, three, suggesting, that, it, was, not, written, by, a, royal, scribe, but, rather, by, a, member, of, the, cathedral, staff, who, then, had, it, exemplified, by, the, royal, court, other, early,

significance, in, the, original, charter, this, part, of, magna, carta, became, singled, out, as, particularly, important, in, later, centuries, in, the, united, states, for, example, the, supreme, court, of, california, interpreted, clause, 45, in, 1974, as, establishing, a, requirement, in, common, law, that, a, defendant, faced, with, the, potential, of, incarceration, be, entitled, to, a, trial, overseen, by, a, legally, trained, judge, royal, forests, were, economically, important, in, medieval, england, and, were, both, protected, and, exploited, by, the, crown, supplying, the, king, with, hunting, grounds, raw, materials, and, money, they, were, subject, to, special, royal, jurisdiction, and, the, resulting, forest, law, was, according, to, the, historian, richard, huscroft, harsh, and, arbitrary, a, matter, purely, for, the, king, s, will, the, size, of, the, forests, had, expanded, under, the, angevin, kings, an, unpopular, development, the, 1215, charter, had, several, clauses, relating, to, the, royal, forests, clauses, 47, and, 48, promised, to, deforest, the, lands, added, to, the, forests, under, john, and, investigate, the, use, of, royal, rights, in, this, area, but, notably, did, not, address, the, forestation, of, the, previous, kings, while, clause, 53, promised, some, form, of, redress, for, those, affected, by, the, recent, changes, and, clause, 44, promised, some, relief, from, the, operation, of, the, forest, courts, neither, magna, carta, nor, the, subsequent, charter, of, the, forest, proved, entirely, satisfactory, as, a, way, of, managing, the, political, tensions, arising, in, the, operation, of, the, royal, forests, some, of, the, clauses, addressed, wider, economic, issues, the, concerns, of, the, barons, over, the, treatment, of, their, debts, to, jewish, moneylenders, who, occupied, a, special, position, in, medieval, england, and, were, by, tradition, under, the, king, s, protection, were, addressed, by, clauses, 10, and, 11, the, charter, concluded, this, section, with, the, phrase, debts, owing, to, other, than, jews, shall, be, dealt, with, likewise, so, it, is, debatable, to, what, extent, the, jews, were, being, singled, out, by, these, clauses, some, issues, were, relatively, specific, such, as, clause, 33, which, ordered, the, removal, of, all, fishing, weirs, an, important, and, growing, source, of, revenue, at, the, time, from, england, s, rivers, the, role, of, the, english, church, had, been, a, matter, for, great, debate, in, the, years, prior, to, the, 1215, charter, the, norman, and, angevin, kings, had, traditionally, exercised, a, great, deal, of, power, over, the, church, within, their, territories, from, the, 1040s, onwards, successive, popes, had, emphasised, the, importance, of, the, church, being, governed, more, effectively, from, rome, and, had, established, an, independent, judicial, system, and, hierarchical, chain, of, authority, after, the, 1140s, these, principles, had, been, largely, accepted, within, the, english, church, even, if, accompanied, by, an, element, of, concern, about, centralising, authority, in, rome, these, changes, brought, the, customary, rights, of, lay, rulers, such, as, john, over, ecclesiastical, appointments, into, question, as, described, above, john, had, come, to, a, compromise, with, pope, innocent, iii, in, exchange, for, his, political, support, for, the, king, and, clause, 1, of, magna, carta, prominently, displayed, this, arrangement, promising, the, freedoms, and, liberties, of, the, church, the, importance, of, this, clause, may, also, reflect, the, role, of, archbishop, langton, in, the, negotiations, langton, had, taken, a, strong, line, on, this, issue, during, his, career, only, three, clauses, of, magna, carta, still, remain, on, statute, in, england, and, wales, these, clauses, concern, 1, the, freedom, of, the, english, church, 2, the, ancient, liberties, of, the, city, of, london, clause, 13, in, the, 1215, charter, clause, 9, in, the, 1297, statute, and, 3, a, right, to, due, legal, process, clauses, 39, and, 40, in, the, 1215, charter, clause, 29, in, the, 1297,
