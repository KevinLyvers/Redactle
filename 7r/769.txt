introspection, is, the, examination, of, one, s, own, conscious, thoughts, and, feelings, in, psychology, the, process, of, introspection, relies, on, the, observation, of, one, s, mental, state, while, in, a, spiritual, context, it, may, refer, to, the, examination, of, one, s, soul, introspection, is, closely, related, to, human, self, reflection, and, self, discovery, and, is, contrasted, with, external, observation, it, generally, provides, a, privileged, access, to, one, s, own, mental, states, not, mediated, by, other, sources, of, knowledge, so, that, individual, experience, of, the, mind, is, unique, introspection, can, determine, any, number, of, mental, states, including, sensory, bodily, cognitive, emotional, and, so, forth, introspection, has, been, a, subject, of, philosophical, discussion, for, thousands, of, years, the, philosopher, plato, asked, why, should, we, not, calmly, and, patiently, review, our, own, thoughts, and, thoroughly, examine, and, see, what, these, appearances, in, us, really, are, while, introspection, is, applicable, to, many, facets, of, philosophical, thought, it, is, perhaps, best, known, for, its, role, in, epistemology, in, this, context, introspection, is, often, compared, with, perception, reason, memory, and, testimony, as, a, source, of, knowledge, it, has, often, been, claimed, that, wilhelm, wundt, the, father, of, experimental, psychology, was, the, first, to, adopt, introspection, to, experimental, psychology, though, the, methodological, idea, had, been, presented, long, before, as, by, 18th, century, german, philosopher, psychologists, such, as, alexander, gottlieb, baumgarten, or, johann, nicolaus, tetens, also, wundt, s, views, on, introspection, must, be, approached, with, great, care, wundt, was, influenced, by, notable, physiologists, such, as, gustav, fechner, who, used, a, kind, of, controlled, introspection, as, a, means, to, study, human, sensory, organs, building, upon, the, pre, existing, use, of, introspection, in, physiology, wundt, believed, the, method, of, introspection, was, the, ability, to, observe, an, experience, not, just, the, logical, reflection, or, speculations, which, some, others, interpreted, his, meaning, to, be, wundt, imposed, exacting, control, over, the, use, of, introspection, in, his, experimental, laboratory, at, the, university, of, leipzig, making, it, possible, for, other, scientists, to, replicate, his, experiments, elsewhere, a, development, that, proved, essential, to, the, development, of, psychology, as, a, modern, peer, reviewed, scientific, discipline, such, exact, purism, was, typical, of, wundt, and, he, instructed, all, introspection, observations, be, performed, under, these, same, instructions, 1, the, observer, must, if, possible, be, in, a, position, to, determine, beforehand, the, entrance, of, the, process, to, be, observed, 2, the, introspectionist, must, as, far, as, possible, grasp, the, phenomenon, in, a, state, of, strained, attention, and, follow, its, course, 3, every, observation, must, in, order, to, make, certain, be, capable, of, being, repeated, several, times, under, the, same, conditions, and, 4, the, conditions, under, which, the, phenomenon, appears, must, be, found, out, by, the, variation, of, the, attendant, circumstances, and, when, this, was, done, the, various, coherent, experiments, must, be, varied, according, to, a, plan, partly, by, eliminating, certain, stimuli, and, partly, by, grading, their, strength, and, quality, edward, titchener, was, an, early, pioneer, in, experimental, psychology, and, student, of, wilhelm, wundt, after, earning, his, doctorate, under, the, tutelage, of, wundt, at, the, university, of, leipzig, he, made, his, way, to, cornell, university, where, he, established, his, own, laboratory, and, research, when, titchener, arrived, at, cornell, in, 1894, psychology, was, still, a, fledgling, discipline, especially, in, the, united, states, and, titchener, was, a, key, figure, in, bringing, wundt, s, ideas, to, america, however, titchener, misrepresented, some, of, wundt, s, ideas, to, the, american, psychological, establishment, especially, in, his, account, of, introspection, which, titchener, taught, only, served, a, purpose, in, the, qualitative, analysis, of, consciousness, into, its, various, parts, while, wundt, saw, it, as, a, means, to, quantitatively, measure, the, whole, of, conscious, experience, titchener, was, exclusively, interested, in, the, individual, components, that, comprise, conscious, experience, while, wundt, seeing, little, purpose, in, the, analysis, of, individual, components, focused, on, synthesis, of, these, components, ultimately, titchener, s, ideas, would, form, the, basis, of, the, short, lived, psychological, theory, of, structuralism, american, historiography, of, introspection, according, to, some, authors, is, dominated, by, three, misconceptions, in, particular, historians, of, psychology, tend, to, argue, 1, that, introspection, once, was, the, dominant, method, of, psychological, inquiry, 2, that, behaviorism, and, in, particular, john, b, watson, is, responsible, for, discrediting, introspection, as, a, valid, method, and, 3, that, scientific, psychology, completely, abandoned, introspection, as, a, result, of, those, critiques, however, introspection, has, not, been, the, dominant, method, it, is, believed, to, be, so, because, edward, titchener, s, student, edwin, g, boring, in, his, influential, historical, accounts, of, experimental, psychology, privileged, titchener, s, views, while, giving, little, credit, to, original, sources, introspection, has, been, critiqued, by, many, other, psychologists, including, wilhelm, wundt, and, knight, dunlap, who, in, his, article, the, case, against, introspection, presents, an, argument, against, self, observation, that, is, not, primarily, rooted, in, behaviorist, epistemology, introspection, is, still, widely, used, in, psychology, but, now, implicitly, as, self, report, surveys, interviews, and, some, fmri, studies, are, based, on, introspection, 4, it, is, not, the, method, but, rather, its, name, that, has, been, dropped, from, the, dominant, psychological, vocabulary, partly, as, a, result, of, titchener, s, misrepresentation, the, use, of, introspection, diminished, after, his, death, and, the, subsequent, decline, of, structuralism, later, psychological, movements, such, as, functionalism, and, behaviorism, rejected, introspection, for, its, lack, of, scientific, reliability, among, other, factors, functionalism, originally, arose, in, direct, opposition, to, structuralism, opposing, its, narrow, focus, on, the, elements, of, consciousness, and, emphasizing, the, purpose, of, consciousness, and, other, psychological, behavior, behaviorism, s, objection, to, introspection, focused, much, more, on, its, unreliability, and, subjectivity, which, conflicted, with, behaviorism, s, focus, on, measurable, behavior, the, more, recently, established, cognitive, psychology, movement, has, to, some, extent, accepted, introspection, s, usefulness, in, the, study, of, psychological, phenomena, though, generally, only, in, experiments, pertaining, to, internal, thought, conducted, under, experimental, conditions, for, example, in, the, think, aloud, protocol, investigators, cue, participants, to, speak, their, thoughts, aloud, in, order, to, study, an, active, thought, process, without, forcing, an, individual, to, comment, on, the, process, itself, already, in, the, 18th, century, authors, had, criticized, the, use, of, introspection, both, for, knowing, one, s, own, mind, and, as, a, method, for, psychology, david, hume, pointed, out, that, introspecting, a, mental, state, tends, to, alter, the, very, state, itself, a, german, author, christian, gottfried, sch, tz, noted, that, introspection, is, often, described, as, mere, inner, sensation, but, actually, requires, also, attention, that, introspection, does, not, get, at, unconscious, mental, states, and, that, it, cannot, be, used, naively, one, needs, to, know, what, to, look, for, immanuel, kant, added, that, if, they, are, understood, too, narrowly, introspective, experiments, are, impossible, introspection, delivers, at, best, hints, about, what, goes, on, in, the, mind, it, does, not, suffice, to, justify, knowledge, claims, about, the, mind, similarly, the, idea, continued, to, be, discussed, between, john, stuart, mill, and, auguste, comte, recent, psychological, research, on, cognition, and, attribution, has, asked, people, to, report, on, their, mental, processes, for, instance, to, say, why, they, made, a, particular, choice, or, how, they, arrived, at, a, judgment, in, some, situations, these, reports, are, clearly, confabulated, for, example, people, justify, choices, they, have, not, in, fact, made, such, results, undermine, the, idea, that, those, verbal, reports, are, based, on, direct, introspective, access, to, mental, content, instead, judgements, about, one, s, own, mind, seem, to, be, inferences, from, overt, behavior, similar, to, judgements, made, about, another, person, however, it, is, hard, to, assess, whether, these, results, only, apply, to, unusual, experimental, situations, or, if, they, reveal, something, about, everyday, introspection, the, theory, of, the, adaptive, unconscious, suggests, that, a, very, large, proportion, of, mental, processes, even, high, level, processes, like, goal, setting, and, decision, making, are, inaccessible, to, introspection, indeed, it, is, questionable, how, confident, researchers, can, be, in, their, own, introspections, one, of, the, central, implications, of, dissociations, between, consciousness, and, meta, consciousness, is, that, individuals, presumably, including, researchers, can, misrepresent, their, experiences, to, themselves, jack, and, roepstorff, assert, there, is, also, a, sense, in, which, subjects, simply, cannot, be, wrong, about, their, own, experiential, states, presumably, they, arrived, at, this, conclusion, by, drawing, on, the, seemingly, self, evident, quality, of, their, own, introspections, and, assumed, that, it, must, equally, apply, to, others, however, when, we, consider, research, on, the, topic, this, conclusion, seems, less, self, evident, if, for, example, extensive, introspection, can, cause, people, to, make, decisions, that, they, later, regret, then, one, very, reasonable, possibility, is, that, the, introspection, caused, them, to, lose, touch, with, their, feelings, in, short, empirical, studies, suggest, that, people, can, fail, to, appraise, adequately, i, e, are, wrong, about, their, own, experiential, states, another, question, in, regards, to, the, veracious, accountability, of, introspection, is, if, researchers, lack, the, confidence, in, their, own, introspections, and, those, of, their, participants, then, how, can, it, gain, legitimacy, three, strategies, are, accountable, identifying, behaviors, that, establish, credibility, finding, common, ground, that, enables, mutual, understanding, and, developing, a, trust, that, allows, one, to, know, when, to, give, the, benefit, of, the, doubt, that, is, to, say, that, words, are, only, meaningful, if, validated, by, one, s, actions, when, people, report, strategies, feelings, or, beliefs, their, behaviors, must, correspond, with, these, statements, if, they, are, to, be, believed, even, when, their, introspections, are, uninformative, people, still, give, confident, descriptions, of, their, mental, processes, being, unaware, of, their, unawareness, this, phenomenon, has, been, termed, the, introspection, illusion, and, has, been, used, to, explain, some, cognitive, biases, and, belief, in, some, paranormal, phenomena, when, making, judgements, about, themselves, subjects, treat, their, own, introspections, as, reliable, whereas, they, judge, other, people, based, on, their, behavior, this, can, lead, to, illusions, of, superiority, for, example, people, generally, see, themselves, as, less, conformist, than, others, and, this, seems, to, be, because, they, do, not, introspect, any, urge, to, conform, another, reliable, finding, is, that, people, generally, see, themselves, as, less, biased, than, everyone, else, because, they, are, not, likely, to, introspect, any, biased, thought, processes, one, experiment, tried, to, give, their, subjects, access, to, others, introspections, they, made, audio, recordings, of, subjects, who, had, been, told, to, say, whatever, came, into, their, heads, as, they, answered, a, question, about, their, own, bias, although, subjects, persuaded, themselves, they, were, unlikely, to, be, biased, their, introspective, reports, did, not, sway, the, assessments, of, observers, when, subjects, were, explicitly, told, to, avoid, relying, on, introspection, their, assessments, of, their, own, bias, became, more, realistic, in, buddhism, sampaja, a, refers, to, the, mental, process, by, which, one, continuously, monitors, one, s, own, body, and, mind, in, the, practice, of, amatha, its, principal, function, is, to, note, the, occurrence, of, laxity, and, excitation, it, is, of, central, importance, for, meditative, practice, in, all, buddhist, traditions, in, judaism, particularly, in, the, teachings, of, the, practitioners, of, mussar, a, person, could, achieve, progress, in, perfecting, their, character, traits, through, a, daily, cheshbon, hanefesh, or, accounting, of, the, soul, in, the, practice, of, cheshbon, hanefesh, a, person, introspects, about, themselves, their, day, their, faults, progress, and, so, on, and, over, time, can, use, the, data, and, process, to, change, behavior, and, thoughts, introspection, is, encouraged, during, the, penitent, season, in, the, month, of, elul, in, order, to, correct, the, year, s, sins, through, repentance, which, in, judaism, begins, with, recalling, and, recognizing, them, in, christianity, perfection, is, not, just, the, possession, and, preservation, of, sanctifying, grace, since, perfection, is, determined, by, one, s, action, although, christian, mysticism, has, gained, a, renewed, interest, in, western, christianity, and, is, prominent, in, eastern, christianity, in, eastern, christianity, some, concepts, addressing, human, needs, such, as, sober, introspection, nepsis, require, watchfulness, of, the, human, heart, and, the, conflicts, of, the, human, nous, heart, or, mind, noetic, understanding, can, not, be, achieved, by, rational, or, discursive, thought, i, e, systemization, rationalists, view, prayer, as, to, help, train, a, person, to, focus, on, divinity, through, philosophy, and, intellectual, contemplation, meditation, jains,

often, do, pratikraman, at, least, twice, a, day, many, practice, pratikraman, on, holy, days, such, as, samvatsari, or, forgiveness, day, introspection, is, encouraged, in, schools, such, as, advaita, vedanta, in, order, for, one, to, know, their, own, true, nature, they, need, to, reflect, and, introspect, on, their, true, nature, which, is, what, meditation, is, especially, swami, chinmayananda, emphasised, the, role, of, introspection, in, five, stages, outlined, in, his, book, self, unfoldment, in, islam, greater, jihad, is, the, extertion, of, effort, to, internally, struggle, against, one, s, evil, inclinations, in, sufism, nafs, is, in, its, unrefined, state, the, ego, which, is, considered, to, be, the, lowest, dimension, of, a, person, s, inward, existence, his, animal, and, satanic, nature, introspection, also, referred, to, as, rufus, dialogue, interior, monologue, self, talk, is, the, fiction, writing, mode, used, to, convey, a, character, s, thoughts, as, explained, by, renni, browne, and, dave, king, one, of, the, great, gifts, of, literature, is, that, it, allows, for, the, expression, of, unexpressed, thoughts, according, to, nancy, kress, a, character, s, thoughts, can, greatly, enhance, a, story, deepening, characterization, increasing, tension, and, widening, the, scope, of, a, story, as, outlined, by, jack, m, bickham,
