believed, that, taste, is, something, that, can, be, taught, and, learned, and, she, edited, vogue, as, a, vehicle, to, educate, public, taste, while, fashion, coverage, remained, a, priority, daves, also, elevated, the, written, content, of, american, vogue, particularly, championing, more, robust, arts, and, literature, features, the, daves, era, of, vogue, came, to, an, end, in, 1962, when,

editing, vogue, and, critics, said, that, this, led, the, magazine, to, a, period, of, extravagance, and, luxury, and, excess, under, vreeland, the, magazine, began, to, appeal, to, the, youth, of, the, sexual, revolution, by, focusing, on, contemporary, fashion, and, editorial, features, that, openly, discussed, sexuality, vogue, extended, coverage, to, include, east, village, boutiques, such, as, limbo, on, st, mark, s, place, and, it, included, features, of, personalities, like, andy, warhol, s, superstars, vogue, also, continued, making, household, names, out, of, models, a, practice,

in, chief, grace, mirabella, the, magazine, underwent, extensive, editorial, and, stylistic, changes, in, response, to, changes, of, its, target, audience, mirabella, states, that, she, was, chosen, to, change, vogue, because, women, weren, t, interested, in, reading, about, or, buying, clothes, that, served, no, purpose, in, their, changing, lives, she, was, selected, to, make, the, magazine, appeal, to, the, free, working, liberated, woman, of, the, seventies, the, magazine, changed, in, terms, of, interviews, arts, coverage, and, articles, when, this, stylistic, change, fell, out, of, favor, in, the, 1980s, mirabella, was, fired, well, known, fashion, photographers, for, the, magazine, include, in, july, 1988, with, vogue, losing, readership, and, advertising, to, its, rival, elle,

continues, to, be, american, vogue, s, editor, in, chief, the, contrast, of, wintour, s, vision, with, that, of, her, predecessors, was, noted, as, striking, by, observers, both, critics, and, defenders, amanda, fortini, fashion, and, style, contributor, for, slate, argues, that, her, policy, has, been, beneficial, for, vogue, delivering, it, from, what, some, critics, had, termed, its, boring, beige, years, among, cond, nast, executives, there, was, worry, that, the, grand, dame, of, fashion, publications, was, losing, ground, to, elle, which, in, just, three, years, had, reached, a, paid, circulation, of, 851, 000, compared, to, vogue, s, 1, 2, million, thus, cond, nast, publisher, si, newhouse, brought, in, the, 38, year, old, wintour, who, through, editor, in, chief, positions, at, british, vogue, and, house, garden, had, become, known, not, only, for, her, cutting, edge, visual, sense, but, also, for, her, ability, to, radically, revamp, a, magazine, to, shake, things, up, although, she, has, had, a, strong, impact, on, the, magazine, wintour, has, been, pinned, as, being, cold, and, difficult, to, work, with, the, most, recent, change, in, vogue, magazine, is, the, return, of, raul, martinez, as, global, creative, editor, as, the, creative, director, he, will, report, to, wintour, and, will, oversee, the, direction, for, the, magazine, globally, and,
