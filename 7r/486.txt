sumerian, sumerian, romanized, eme, gir, 15, lit, native, language, was, the, language, of, ancient, sumer, it, is, one, of, the, oldest, attested, languages, dating, back, to, at, least, 2900, bc, it, is, a, local, language, isolate, that, was, spoken, in, ancient, mesopotamia, in, the, area, that, is, modern, day, iraq, akkadian, a, semitic, language, gradually, replaced, sumerian, as, the, primary, spoken, language, in, the, area, c, 2000, bc, the, exact, date, is, debated, but, sumerian, continued, to, be, used, as, a, sacred, ceremonial, literary, and, scientific, language, in, akkadian, speaking, mesopotamian, states, such, as, assyria, and, babylonia, until, the, 1st, century, ad, thereafter, it, seems, to, have, fallen, into, obscurity, until, the, 19th, century, when, assyriologists, began, deciphering, the, cuneiform, inscriptions, and, excavated, tablets, that, had, been, left, by, its, speakers, in, spite, of, its, extinction, sumerian, exerted, a, significant, impact, on, the, languages, of, the, area, the, cuneiform, script, originally, used, for, sumerian, was, widely, adopted, by, numerous, regional, languages, such, as, akkadian, elamite, eblaite, hittite, hurrian, luwian, and, urartian, it, similarly, inspired, the, old, persian, alphabet, which, was, used, to, write, the, eponymous, language, the, impact, was, perhaps, the, greatest, on, akkadian, whose, grammar, and, vocabulary, were, significantly, influenced, by, sumerian, the, history, of, written, sumerian, can, be, divided, into, several, periods, the, pictographic, writing, system, used, during, the, proto, literate, period, 3200, bc, 3000, bc, corresponding, to, the, uruk, iii, and, uruk, iv, periods, in, archeology, was, still, so, rudimentary, that, there, remains, some, scholarly, disagreement, about, whether, the, language, written, with, it, is, sumerian, at, all, although, it, has, been, argued, that, there, are, some, albeit, still, very, rare, cases, of, phonetic, indicators, and, spelling, that, show, this, to, be, the, case, the, texts, from, this, period, are, mostly, administrative, there, are, also, a, number, of, sign, lists, which, were, apparently, used, for, the, training, of, scribes, the, next, period, archaic, sumerian, 3000, bc, 2500, bc, is, the, first, stage, of, inscriptions, that, indicate, grammatical, elements, so, the, identification, of, the, language, is, certain, it, includes, some, administrative, texts, and, sign, lists, from, ur, c, 2800, bc, texts, from, shuruppak, and, abu, salabikh, from, 2600, to, 2500, bc, the, so, called, fara, period, or, early, dynastic, period, iiia, are, the, first, to, span, a, greater, variety, of, genres, including, not, only, administrative, texts, and, sign, lists, but, also, incantations, legal, and, literary, texts, including, proverbs, and, early, versions, of, the, famous, works, the, instructions, of, shuruppak, and, the, kesh, temple, hymn, however, the, spelling, of, grammatical, elements, remains, optional, making, the, interpretation, and, linguistic, analysis, of, these, texts, difficult, the, old, sumerian, period, 2500, 2350, bc, is, the, first, one, from, which, well, understood, texts, survive, it, corresponds, mostly, to, the, last, part, of, the, early, dynastic, period, ed, iiib, and, specifically, to, the, first, dynasty, of, lagash, from, where, the, overwhelming, majority, of, surviving, texts, come, the, sources, include, important, royal, inscriptions, with, historical, content, as, well, as, extensive, administrative, records, sometimes, included, in, the, old, sumerian, stage, is, also, the, old, akkadian, period, c, 2350, bc, c, 2200, bc, during, which, mesopotamia, including, sumer, was, united, under, the, rule, of, the, akkadian, empire, at, this, time, akkadian, functioned, as, the, primary, official, language, but, texts, in, sumerian, primarily, administrative, did, continue, to, be, produced, as, well, the, first, phase, of, the, neo, sumerian, period, corresponds, to, the, time, of, gutian, rule, in, mesopotamia, the, most, important, sources, come, from, the, autonomous, second, dynasty, of, lagash, especially, from, the, rule, of, gudea, which, has, produced, extensive, royal, inscriptions, the, second, phase, corresponds, to, the, unification, of, mesopotamia, under, the, third, dynasty, of, ur, which, oversaw, a, renaissance, in, the, use, of, sumerian, throughout, mesopotamia, using, it, as, its, sole, official, written, language, there, is, a, wealth, of, texts, greater, than, from, any, preceding, time, besides, the, extremely, detailed, and, meticulous, administrative, records, there, are, numerous, royal, inscriptions, legal, documents, letters, and, incantations, in, spite, of, the, dominant, position, of, written, sumerian, during, the, ur, iii, dynasty, it, is, controversial, to, what, extent, it, was, actually, spoken, or, had, already, gone, extinct, in, most, parts, of, its, empire, some, facts, have, been, interpreted, as, suggesting, that, many, scribes, and, even, the, royal, court, actually, used, akkadian, as, their, main, spoken, and, native, language, on, the, other, hand, evidence, has, been, adduced, to, the, effect, that, sumerian, continued, to, be, spoken, natively, and, even, remained, dominant, as, an, everyday, language, in, southern, babylonia, including, nippur, and, the, area, to, its, south, by, the, old, babylonian, period, c, 2000, c, 1600, bc, akkadian, had, clearly, supplanted, sumerian, as, a, spoken, language, in, nearly, all, of, its, original, territory, whereas, sumerian, continued, its, existence, as, a, liturgical, and, classical, language, for, religious, artistic, and, scholarly, purposes, in, addition, it, has, been, argued, that, sumerian, persisted, as, a, spoken, language, at, least, in, a, small, part, of, southern, mesopotamia, nippur, and, its, surroundings, at, least, until, about, 1900, bc, and, possibly, until, as, late, as, 1700, bc, nonetheless, it, seems, clear, that, by, far, the, majority, of, scribes, writing, in, sumerian, in, this, point, were, not, native, speakers, and, errors, resulting, from, their, akkadian, mother, tongue, become, apparent, for, this, reason, this, period, as, well, as, the, remaining, time, during, which, sumerian, was, written, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, the, post, sumerian, period, the, written, language, of, administration, law, and, royal, inscriptions, continued, to, be, sumerian, in, the, undoubtedly, semitic, speaking, successor, states, of, ur, iii, during, the, so, called, isin, larsa, period, c, 2000, bc, c, 1750, bc, the, old, babylonian, empire, however, mostly, used, akkadian, in, inscriptions, sometimes, adding, sumerian, versions, the, old, babylonian, period, especially, its, early, part, has, produced, extremely, numerous, and, varied, sumerian, literary, texts, myths, epics, hymns, prayers, wisdom, literature, and, letters, in, fact, nearly, all, preserved, sumerian, religious, and, wisdom, literature, and, the, overwhelming, majority, of, surviving, manuscripts, of, sumerian, literary, texts, in, general, can, be, dated, to, that, time, and, it, is, often, seen, as, the, classical, age, of, sumerian, literature, conversely, far, more, literary, texts, on, tablets, surviving, from, the, old, babylonian, period, are, in, sumerian, than, in, akkadian, even, though, that, time, is, viewed, as, the, classical, period, of, babylonian, culture, and, language, however, it, has, sometimes, been, suggested, that, many, or, most, of, these, old, babylonian, sumerian, texts, may, be, copies, of, works, that, were, originally, composed, in, the, preceding, ur, iii, period, or, earlier, and, some, copies, or, fragments, of, known, compositions, or, literary, genres, have, indeed, been, found, in, tablets, of, neo, sumerian, and, old, sumerian, provenance, in, addition, some, of, the, first, bilingual, sumerian, akkadian, lexical, lists, are, preserved, from, that, time, although, the, lists, were, still, usually, monolingual, and, akkadian, translations, did, not, become, common, until, the, late, middle, babylonian, period, and, there, are, also, grammatical, texts, essentially, bilingual, paradigms, listing, sumerian, grammatical, forms, and, their, postulated, akkadian, equivalents, after, the, old, babylonian, period, or, according, to, some, as, early, as, 1700, bc, the, active, use, of, sumerian, declined, scribes, did, continue, to, produce, texts, in, sumerian, at, a, more, modest, scale, but, generally, with, interlinear, akkadian, translations, and, only, part, of, the, literature, known, in, the, old, babylonian, period, continued, to, be, copied, after, its, end, around, 1600, bc, during, the, middle, babylonian, period, approximately, from, 1600, to, 1000, bc, the, kassite, rulers, continued, to, use, sumerian, in, many, of, their, inscriptions, but, akkadian, seems, to, have, taken, the, place, of, sumerian, as, the, primary, language, of, texts, used, for, the, training, of, scribes, and, their, sumerian, itself, acquires, an, increasingly, artificial, and, akkadian, influenced, form, in, some, cases, a, text, may, not, even, have, been, meant, to, be, read, in, sumerian, instead, it, may, have, functioned, as, a, prestigious, way, of, encoding, akkadian, via, sumerograms, cf, japanese, kanbun, nonetheless, the, study, of, sumerian, and, copying, of, sumerian, texts, remained, an, integral, part, of, scribal, education, and, literary, culture, of, mesopotamia, and, surrounding, societies, influenced, by, it, and, it, retained, that, role, until, the, eclipse, of, the, tradition, of, cuneiform, literacy, itself, in, the, beginning, of, the, common, era, the, most, popular, genres, for, sumerian, texts, after, the, old, babylonian, period, were, incantations, liturgical, texts, and, proverbs, among, longer, texts, the, classics, lugal, e, and, an, gim, were, most, commonly, copied, of, the, 29, royal, inscriptions, of, the, late, second, millennium, bc, 2nd, dynasty, of, isin, about, half, were, in, sumerian, described, as, hypersophisticated, classroom, sumerian, sumerian, is, widely, accepted, to, be, a, local, language, isolate, sumerian, was, at, one, time, widely, held, to, be, an, indo, european, language, but, that, view, has, been, almost, universally, rejected, since, its, decipherment, in, the, early, 20th, century, scholars, have, tried, to, relate, sumerian, to, a, wide, variety, of, languages, because, sumerian, has, prestige, as, the, first, attested, written, language, proposals, for, linguistic, affinity, sometimes, have, a, nationalistic, flavour, attempts, have, been, made, to, link, sumerian, with, a, range, of, widely, disparate, groups, such, as, the, austroasiatic, languages, dravidian, languages, uralic, languages, such, as, hungarian, and, finnish, sino, tibetan, languages, and, turkic, languages, the, last, being, promoted, by, turkish, nationalists, as, part, of, the, sun, language, theory, additionally, long, range, proposals, have, attempted, to, include, sumerian, in, broad, macrofamilies, such, proposals, enjoy, virtually, no, support, among, modern, linguists, sumerologists, and, assyriologists, and, are, typically, seen, as, fringe, theories, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, the, sumerian, language, descended, from, a, late, prehistoric, creole, language, h, yrup, 1992, however, no, conclusive, evidence, only, some, typological, features, can, be, found, to, support, h, yrup, s, view, a, more, widespread, hypothesis, posits, a, proto, euphratean, language, that, preceded, sumerian, in, mesopotamia, and, exerted, an, areal, influence, on, it, especially, in, the, form, of, polysyllabic, words, that, appear, un, sumerian, making, them, suspect, of, being, loanwords, and, are, not, traceable, to, any, other, known, language, there, is, little, speculation, as, to, the, affinities, of, this, substratum, language, or, these, languages, and, it, is, thus, best, treated, as, unclassified, other, researchers, disagree, with, the, assumption, of, a, single, substratum, language, and, argue, that, several, languages, are, involved, a, related, proposal, by, gordon, whittaker, is, that, the, language, of, the, proto, literary, texts, from, the, late, uruk, period, c, 3350, 3100, bc, is, really, an, early, indo, european, language, which, he, terms, euphratic, pictographic, proto, writing, was, used, starting, in, c, 3300, bc, it, is, unclear, what, underlying, language, it, encoded, if, any, by, c, 2800, bc, some, tablets, began, using, syllabic, elements, that, clearly, indicated, a, relation, to, the, sumerian, language, around, 2600, bc, cuneiform, symbols, were, developed, using, a, wedge, shaped, stylus, to, impress, the, shapes, into, wet, clay, this, cuneiform, wedge, shaped, mode, of, writing, co, existed, with, the, proto, cuneiform, archaic, mode, deimel, 1922, lists, 870, signs, used, in, the, early, dynastic, iiia, period, 26th, century, in, the, same, period, the, large, set, of, logographic, signs, had, been, simplified, into, a, logosyllabic, script, comprising, several, hundred, signs, rosengarten, 1967, lists, 468, signs, used, in, sumerian, pre, sargonian, lagash, the, cuneiform, script, was, adapted, to, akkadian, writing, beginning, in, the, mid, third, millennium, over, the, long, period, of, bi, lingual, overlap, of, active, sumerian, and, akkadian, usage, the, two, languages, influenced, each, other, as, reflected, in, numerous, loanwords, and, even, word, order, changes, depending, on, the, context, a, cuneiform, sign, can, be, read, either, as, one, of, several, possible, logograms, each, of, which, corresponds, to, a, word, in, the, sumerian, spoken, language, as, a, phonetic, syllable, v, vc, cv, or, cvc, or, as, a, determinative, a, marker, of, semantic, category, such, as, occupation, or, place, see, the, article, cuneiform, some, sumerian, logograms, were, written, with, multiple, cuneiform, signs, these, logograms, are, called, diri, spellings, after, the, logogram, diri, which, is, written, with, the, signs, si, and, a, the, text, transliteration, of, a, tablet, will, show, just, the, logogram, such, as, the, word, dirig, not, the, separate, component, signs, not, all, epigraphists, are, equally, reliable, and, before, publication, of, an, important, treatment, of, a, text, scholars, will, often, arrange, to, collate, the, published, transliteration, against, the, actual, tablet, to, see, if, any, signs, especially, broken, or, damaged, signs, should, be, represented, differently, our, knowledge, of, the, readings, of, sumerian, signs, is, based, to, a, great, extent, on, lexical, lists, made, for, akkadian, speakers, where, they, are, expressed, by, means, of, syllabic, signs, the, established, readings, were, originally, based, on, lexical, lists, from, the, neo, babylonian, period, which, were, found, in, the, 19th, century, in, the, 20th, century, earlier, lists, from, the, old, babylonian, period, were, published, and, some, researchers, in, the, 21st, century, have, switched, to, using, readings, from, them, there, is, also, variation, in, the, degree, to, which, so, called, auslauts, or, amissable, consonants, morpheme, final, consonants, that, stopped, being, pronounced, at, one, point, or, another, in, the, history, of, sumerian, are, reflected, in, the, transliterations, this, article, generally, used, the, versions, with, expressed, auslauts, the, key, to, reading, logosyllabic, cuneiform, came, from, the, behistun, inscription, a, trilingual, cuneiform, inscription, written, in, old, persian, elamite, and, akkadian, in, a, similar, manner, the, key, to, understanding, egyptian, hieroglyphs, was, the, bilingual, rosetta, stone, and, jean, fran, ois, champollion, s, transcription, in, 1822, in, 1838, henry, rawlinson, building, on, the, 1802, work, of, georg, friedrich, grotefend, was, able, to, decipher, the, old, persian, section, of, the, behistun, inscriptions, using, his, knowledge, of, modern, persian, when, he, recovered, the, rest, of, the, text, in, 1843, he, and, others, were, gradually, able, to, translate, the, elamite, and, akkadian, sections, of, it, starting, with, the, 37, signs, he, had, deciphered, for, the, old, persian, meanwhile, many, more, cuneiform, texts, were, coming, to, light, from, archaeological, excavations, mostly, in, the, semitic, akkadian, language, which, were, duly, deciphered, by, 1850, however, edward, hincks, came, to, suspect, a, non, semitic, origin, for, cuneiform, semitic, languages, are, structured, according, to, consonantal, forms, whereas, cuneiform, when, functioning, phonetically, was, a, syllabary, binding, consonants, to, particular, vowels, furthermore, no, semitic, words, could, be, found, to, explain, the, syllabic, values, given, to, particular, signs, julius, oppert, suggested, that, a, non, semitic, language, had, preceded, akkadian, in, mesopotamia, and, that, speakers, of, this, language, had, developed, the, cuneiform, script, in, 1855, rawlinson, announced, the, discovery, of, non, semitic, inscriptions, at, the, southern, babylonian, sites, of, nippur, larsa, and, uruk, in, 1856, hincks, argued, that, the, untranslated, language, was, agglutinative, in, character, the, language, was, called, scythic, by, some, and, confusingly, akkadian, by, others, in, 1869, oppert, proposed, the, name, sumerian, based, on, the, known, title, king, of, sumer, and, akkad, reasoning, that, if, akkad, signified, the, semitic, portion, of, the, kingdom, sumer, might, describe, the, non, semitic, annex, credit, for, being, first, to, scientifically, treat, a, bilingual, sumerian, akkadian, text, belongs, to, paul, haupt, who, published, die, sumerischen, familiengesetze, the, sumerian, family, laws, in, 1879, ernest, de, sarzec, began, excavating, the, sumerian, site, of, tello, ancient, girsu, capital, of, the, state, of, lagash, in, 1877, and, published, the, first, part, of, d, couvertes, en, chald, e, with, transcriptions, of, sumerian, tablets, in, 1884, the, university, of, pennsylvania, began, excavating, sumerian, nippur, in, 1888, a, classified, list, of, sumerian, ideographs, by, r, br, nnow, appeared, in, 1889, the, bewildering, number, and, variety, of, phonetic, values, that, signs, could, have, in, sumerian, led, to, a, detour, in, understanding, the, language, a, paris, based, orientalist, joseph, hal, vy, argued, from, 1874, onward, that, sumerian, was, not, a, natural, language, but, rather, a, secret, code, a, cryptolect, and, for, over, a, decade, the, leading, assyriologists, battled, over, this, issue, for, a, dozen, years, starting, in, 1885, friedrich, delitzsch, accepted, hal, vy, s, arguments, not, renouncing, hal, vy, until, 1897, fran, ois, thureau, dangin, working, at, the, louvre, in, paris, also, made, significant, contributions, to, deciphering, sumerian, with, publications, from, 1898, to, 1938, such, as, his, 1905, publication, of, les, inscriptions, de, sumer, et, d, akkad, charles, fossey, at, the, coll, ge, de, france, in, paris, was, another, prolific, and, reliable, scholar, his, pioneering, contribution, au, dictionnaire, sum, rien, assyrien, paris, 1905, 1907, turns, out, to, provide, the, foundation, for, p, anton, deimel, s, 1934, sumerisch, akkadisches, glossar, vol, iii, of, deimel, s, 4, volume, sumerisches, lexikon, in, 1908, stephen, herbert, langdon, summarized, the, rapid, expansion, in, knowledge, of, sumerian, and, akkadian, vocabulary, in, the, pages, of, babyloniaca, a, journal, edited, by, charles, virolleaud, in, an, article, sumerian, assyrian, vocabularies, which, reviewed, a, valuable, new, book, on, rare, logograms, by, bruno, meissner, subsequent, scholars, have, found, langdon, s, work, including, his, tablet, transcriptions, to, be, not, entirely, reliable, in, 1944, the, sumerologist, samuel, noah, kramer, provided, a, detailed, and, readable, summary, of, the, decipherment, of, sumerian, in, his, sumerian, mythology, friedrich, delitzsch, published, a, learned, sumerian, dictionary, and, grammar, in, the, form, of, his, sumerisches, glossar, and, grundz, ge, der, sumerischen, grammatik, both, appearing, in, 1914, delitzsch, s, student, arno, poebel, published, a, grammar, with, the, same, title, grundz, ge, der, sumerischen, grammatik, in, 1923, and, for, 50, years, it, would, be, the, standard, for, students, studying, sumerian, another, highly, influential, figure, in, sumerology, during, much, of, the, 20th, century, was, adam, falkenstein, who, produced, a, grammar, of, the, language, of, gudea, s, inscriptions, poebel, s, grammar, was, finally, superseded, in, 1984, on, the, publication, of, the, sumerian, language, an, introduction, to, its, history, and, grammatical, structure, by, marie, louise, thomsen, while, there, are, various, points, in, sumerian, grammar, on, which, thomsen, s, views, are, not, shared, by, most, sumerologists, today, thomsen, s, grammar, often, with, express, mention, of, the, critiques, put, forward, by, pascal, attinger, in, his, 1993, el, ments, de, linguistique, sum, rienne, la, construction, de, du, 11, e, di, dire, is, the, starting, point, of, most, recent, academic, discussions, of, sumerian, grammar, more, recent, monograph, length, grammars, of, sumerian, include, dietz, otto, edzard, s, 2003, sumerian, grammar, and, bram, jagersma, s, 2010, a, descriptive, grammar, of, sumerian, currently, digital, but, soon, to, be, printed, in, revised, form, by, oxford, university, press, piotr, michalowski, s, essay, entitled, simply, sumerian, in, the, 2004, the, cambridge, encyclopedia, of, the, world, s, ancient, languages, has, also, been, recognized, as, a, good, modern, grammatical, sketch, there, is, relatively, little, consensus, even, among, reasonable, sumerologists, in, comparison, to, the, state, of, most, modern, or, classical, languages, verbal, morphology, in, particular, is, hotly, disputed, in, addition, to, the, general, grammars, there, are, many, monographs, and, articles, about, particular, areas, of, sumerian, grammar, without, which, a, survey, of, the, field, could, not, be, considered, complete, the, primary, institutional, lexical, effort, in, sumerian, is, the, pennsylvania, sumerian, dictionary, project, begun, in, 1974, in, 2004, the, psd, was, released, on, the, web, as, the, epsd, the, project, is, currently, supervised, by, steve, tinney, it, has, not, been, updated, online, since, 2006, but, tinney, and, colleagues, are, working, on, a, new, edition, of, the, epsd, a, working, draft, of, which, is, available, online, assumed, phonological, and, morphological, forms, will, be, between, slashes, and, curly, brackets, respectively, with, plain, text, used, for, the, standard, assyriological, transcription, of, sumerian, most, of, the, following, examples, are, unattested, note, also, that, not, unlike, most, other, pre, modern, orthographies, sumerian, cuneiform, spelling, is, highly, variable, so, the, transcriptions, and, the, cuneiform, examples, will, generally, show, only, one, or, at, most, a, few, common, graphic, forms, out, of, many, that, may, occur, spelling, practices, have, also, changed, significantly, in, the, course, of, the, history, of, sumerian, the, examples, in, the, article, will, use, the, most, phonetically, explicit, spellings, attested, which, usually, means, old, babylonian, or, ur, iii, period, spellings, except, where, an, authentic, example, from, another, period, is, used, modern, knowledge, of, sumerian, phonology, is, flawed, and, incomplete, because, of, the, lack, of, speakers, the, transmission, through, the, filter, of, akkadian, phonology, and, the, difficulties, posed, by, the, cuneiform, script, as, i, m, diakonoff, observes, when, we, try, to, find, out, the, morphophonological, structure, of, the, sumerian, language, we, must, constantly, bear, in, mind, that, we, are, not, dealing, with, a, language, directly, but, are, reconstructing, it, from, a, very, imperfect, mnemonic, writing, system, which, had, not, been, basically, aimed, at, the, rendering, of, morphophonemics, early, sumerian, is, conjectured, to, have, had, at, least, the, consonants, listed, in, the, table, below, the, consonants, in, brackets, are, reconstructed, by, some, scholars, based, on, indirect, evidence, if, they, existed, they, were, lost, around, the, ur, iii, period, in, the, late, 3rd, millennium, bc, the, existence, of, various, other, consonants, has, been, hypothesized, based, on, graphic, alternations, and, loans, though, none, have, found, wide, acceptance, for, example, diakonoff, lists, evidence, for, two, lateral, phonemes, two, rhotics, two, back, fricatives, and, two, g, sounds, excluding, the, velar, nasal, and, assumes, a, phonemic, difference, between, consonants, that, are, dropped, word, finally, such, as, the, g, in, zag, za, 3, and, consonants, that, remain, such, as, the, g, in, lag, other, hidden, consonant, phonemes, that, have, been, suggested, include, semivowels, such, as, j, and, w, and, a, glottal, fricative, h, or, a, glottal, stop, that, could, explain, the, absence, of, vowel, contraction, in, some, words, though, objections, have, been, raised, against, that, as, well, a, recent, descriptive, grammar, by, bram, jagersma, includes, j, h, and, as, unwritten, consonants, with, the, glottal, stop, even, serving, as, the, first, person, pronominal, prefix, however, these, unwritten, consonants, had, been, lost, by, the, ur, iii, period, according, to, jagersma, very, often, a, word, final, consonant, was, not, expressed, in, writing, and, was, possibly, omitted, in, pronunciation, so, it, surfaced, only, when, followed, by, a, vowel, for, example, the, k, of, the, genitive, case, ending, ak, does, not, appear, in, e, 2, lugal, la, the, king, s, house, but, it, becomes, obvious, in, e, 2, lugal, la, kam, it, is, the, king, s, house, compare, liaison, in, french, jagersma, believes, that, the, lack, of, expression, of, word, final, consonants, was, originally, mostly, a, graphic, convention, but, that, in, the, late, 3rd, millennium, voiceless, aspirated, stops, and, affricates, p, t, k, and, ts, were, indeed, gradually, lost, in, syllable, final, position, as, were, the, unaspirated, stops, d, and, g, the, vowels, that, are, clearly, distinguished, by, the, cuneiform, script, are, a, e, i, and, u, various, researchers, have, posited, the, existence, of, more, vowel, phonemes, such, as, o, and, even, and, which, would, have, been, concealed, by, the, transmission, through, akkadian, as, that, language, does, not, distinguish, them, that, would, explain, the, seeming, existence, of, numerous, homophones, in, transliterated, sumerian, as, well, as, some, details, of, the, phenomena, mentioned, in, the, next, paragraph, these, hypotheses, are, not, yet, generally, accepted, phonemic, vowel, length, has, also, been, posited, by, many, scholars, based, on, vowel, length, in, sumerian, loanwords, in, akkadian, occasional, so, called, plene, spellings, with, extra, vowel, signs, and, some, internal, evidence, from, alternations, however, scholars, who, believe, in, the, existence, of, phonemic, vowel, length, do, not, consider, it, possible, to, reconstruct, the, length, of, the, vowels, in, most, sumerian, words, during, the, old, sumerian, period, the, southern, dialects, those, used, in, the, cities, of, lagash, umma, ur, and, uruk, which, also, provide, the, overwhelming, majority, of, material, from, that, stage, exhibited, a, vowel, harmony, rule, based, on, vowel, height, or, advanced, tongue, root, essentially, prefixes, containing, e, or, i, appear, to, alternate, between, e, in, front, of, syllables, containing, open, vowels, and, i, in, front, of, syllables, containing, close, vowels, e, g, e, ka, 4, he, runs, but, i, 3, gub, he, stands, certain, verbs, with, stem, vowels, spelt, with, u, and, e, however, seem, to, take, prefixes, with, a, vowel, quality, opposite, to, the, one, that, would, have, been, expected, according, to, this, rule, which, has, been, variously, interpreted, as, an, indication, either, of, the, existence, of, additional, vowel, phonemes, in, sumerian, or, simply, of, incorrectly, reconstructed, readings, of, individual, lexemes, the, 3rd, person, plural, dimensional, prefix, ne, is, also, unaffected, which, jagersma, believes, to, be, caused, by, the, length, of, its, vowel, in, addition, some, have, argued, for, a, second, vowel, harmony, rule, there, also, appear, to, be, many, cases, of, partial, or, complete, assimilation, of, the, vowel, of, certain, prefixes, and, suffixes, to, one, in, the, adjacent, syllable, reflected, in, writing, in, some, of, the, later, periods, and, there, is, a, noticeable, albeit, not, absolute, tendency, for, disyllabic, stems, to, have, the, same, vowel, in, both, syllables, these, patterns, too, are, interpreted, as, evidence, for, a, richer, vowel, inventory, by, some, researchers, for, example, we, find, forms, like, g, a, ka, 4, let, me, run, but, from, the, neo, sumerian, period, onwards, occasional, spellings, like, g, u, 2, mu, ra, ab, um, 2, let, me, give, it, to, you, according, to, jagersma, these, assimilations, are, limited, to, open, syllables, and, as, with, vowel, harmony, jagersma, interprets, their, absence, as, the, result, of, vowel, length, or, of, stress, in, at, least, some, cases, there, is, evidence, of, various, cases, of, elision, of, vowels, apparently, in, unstressed, syllables, in, particular, an, initial, vowel, in, a, word, of, more, than, two, syllables, seems, to, have, been, elided, in, many, cases, what, appears, to, be, vowel, contraction, in, hiatus, aa, ia, ua, a, ae, a, ie, i, or, e, ue, u, or, e, etc, is, also, very, common, there, is, some, uncertainty, and, variance, of, opinion, as, to, whether, the, result, in, each, specific, case, is, a, long, vowel, or, whether, a, vowel, is, simply, replaced, deleted, syllables, could, have, any, of, the, following, structures, v, cv, vc, cvc, more, complex, syllables, if, sumerian, had, them, are, not, expressed, as, such, by, the, cuneiform, script, sumerian, stress, is, usually, presumed, to, have, been, dynamic, since, it, seems, to, have, caused, vowel, elisions, on, many, occasions, opinions, vary, on, its, placement, as, argued, by, bram, jagersma, and, confirmed, by, other, scholars, the, adaptation, of, akkadian, words, of, sumerian, origin, seems, to, suggest, that, sumerian, stress, tended, to, be, on, the, last, syllable, of, the, word, at, least, in, its, citation, form, the, treatment, of, forms, with, grammatical, morphemes, is, less, clear, many, cases, of, apheresis, in, forms, with, enclitics, have, been, interpreted, as, entailing, that, the, same, rule, was, true, of, the, phonological, word, on, many, occasions, i, e, that, the, stress, could, be, shifted, onto, the, enclitics, however, the, fact, that, many, of, these, same, enclitics, have, allomorphs, with, apocopated, final, vowels, e, g, e, suggests, that, they, were, on, the, contrary, unstressed, when, these, allomorphs, arose, it, has, also, been, conjectured, that, the, frequent, assimilation, of, the, vowels, of, non, final, syllables, to, the, vowel, of, the, final, syllable, of, the, word, may, be, due, to, stress, on, it, however, a, number, of, suffixes, and, enclitics, consisting, of, e, or, beginning, in, e, are, also, assimilated, and, reduced, in, earlier, scholarship, somewhat, different, views, were, expressed, and, attempts, were, made, to, formulate, detailed, rules, for, the, effect, of, grammatical, morphemes, and, compounding, on, stress, but, with, inconclusive, results, based, predominantly, on, patterns, of, vowel, elision, adam, falkenstein, argued, that, stress, in, monomorphemic, words, tended, to, be, on, the, first, syllable, and, that, the, same, applied, without, exception, to, reduplicated, stems, but, that, the, stress, shifted, onto, the, last, syllable, in, a, first, member, of, a, compound, or, idiomatic, phrase, onto, the, syllable, preceding, a, final, suffix, enclitic, and, onto, the, first, syllable, of, the, possessive, enclitic, ani, in, his, view, single, verbal, prefixes, were, unstressed, but, longer, sequences, of, verbal, prefixes, attracted, the, stress, to, their, first, syllable, jagersma, has, objected, that, many, of, falkenstein, s, examples, of, elision, are, medial, and, so, while, the, stress, was, obviously, not, on, the, medial, syllable, in, question, the, examples, do, not, show, where, it, was, joachim, krecher, attempted, to, find, more, clues, in, texts, written, phonetically, by, assuming, that, geminations, plene, spellings, and, unexpected, stronger, consonant, qualities, were, clues, to, stress, placement, using, this, method, he, confirmed, falkenstein, s, views, that, reduplicated, forms, were, stressed, on, the, first, syllable, and, that, there, was, generally, stress, on, the, syllable, preceding, a, final, suffix, enclitic, on, the, penultimate, syllable, of, a, polysyllabic, enclitic, such, as, ani, zunene, etc, on, the, last, syllable, of, the, first, member, of, a, compound, and, on, the, first, syllable, in, a, sequence, of, verbal, prefixes, however, he, found, that, single, verbal, prefixes, received, the, stress, just, as, prefix, sequences, did, and, that, in, most, of, the, above, cases, another, stress, often, seemed, to, be, present, as, well, on, the, stem, to, which, the, suffixes, enclitics, were, added, on, the, second, compound, member, in, compounds, and, possibly, on, the, verbal, stem, that, prefixes, were, added, to, or, on, following, syllables, he, also, did, not, agree, that, the, stress, of, monomorphemic, words, was, typically, initial, and, believed, to, have, found, evidence, of, words, with, initial, as, well, as, with, final, stress, in, fact, he, did, not, even, exclude, the, possibility, that, stress, was, normally, stem, final, pascal, attinger, has, partly, concurred, with, krecher, but, doubts, that, the, stress, was, always, on, the, syllable, preceding, a, suffix, enclitic, and, argues, that, in, a, prefix, sequence, the, stressed, syllable, wasn, t, the, first, one, but, rather, the, last, one, if, heavy, and, the, next, to, the, last, one, in, other, cases, attinger, has, also, remarked, that, the, patterns, observed, may, be, the, result, of, akkadian, influence, either, due, to, linguistic, convergence, while, sumerian, was, still, a, living, language, or, since, the, data, comes, from, the, old, babylonian, period, a, feature, of, sumerian, as, pronounced, by, native, speakers, of, akkadian, the, latter, has, also, been, pointed, out, by, jagersma, who, is, in, addition, sceptical, about, the, very, assumptions, underlying, the, method, used, by, krecher, to, establish, the, place, of, stress, sumerian, writing, expressed, pronunciation, only, roughly, it, was, often, morphophonemic, so, much, of, the, allomorphic, variation, could, be, ignored, especially, in, earlier, sumerian, coda, consonants, were, also, often, ignored, in, spelling, e, g, mung, are, they, put, it, here, could, be, written, mu, g, ar, re, 2, the, use, of, vc, signs, for, that, purpose, producing, more, elaborate, spellings, such, as, mu, un, g, ar, re, 2, e, 3, became, more, common, only, in, the, neo, sumerian, and, especially, in, the, old, babylonian, period, conversely, an, intervocalic, consonant, especially, at, the, end, of, a, morpheme, followed, by, a, vowel, initial, morpheme, was, usually, repeated, by, the, use, of, a, cv, sign, for, the, same, consonant, e, g, sar, write, sar, ra, written, this, results, in, orthographic, gemination, that, is, usually, reflected, in, sumerological, transliteration, but, does, not, actually, designate, any, phonological, phenomenon, such, as, length, it, is, also, relevant, in, this, context, that, as, explained, above, many, morpheme, final, consonants, seem, to, have, been, elided, unless, followed, by, a, vowel, at, various, stages, in, the, history, of, sumerian, these, are, traditionally, termed, auslauts, in, sumerology, and, may, or, may, not, be, expressed, in, transliteration, e, g, the, logogram, for, ag, a, g, heart, may, be, transliterated, as, ag, 4, or, as, a, 3, thus, when, the, following, consonant, appears, in, front, of, a, vowel, it, can, be, said, to, be, expressed, only, by, the, next, sign, for, example, ag, 4, ga, in, the, heart, can, also, be, interpreted, as, a, 3, ga, of, course, when, a, cvc, sound, sequence, is, expressed, by, a, sequence, of, signs, with, the, sound, values, cv, vc, that, does, not, necessarily, indicate, a, long, vowel, or, a, sequence, of, identical, vowels, either, to, mark, such, a, thing, so, called, plene, writings, with, an, additional, vowel, sign, repeating, the, preceding, vowel, were, used, although, that, never, came, to, be, done, systematically, a, typical, plene, writing, involved, a, sequence, such, as, c, v, v, vc, cv, e, g, ama, a, for, ama, a, ama, e, the, mother, ergative, case, sumerian, texts, vary, in, the, degree, to, which, they, use, logograms, or, opt, for, syllabic, phonetic, spellings, instead, e, g, the, word, g, ar, put, may, also, be, written, phonetically, as, g, a, 2, ar, they, also, vary, in, the, degree, to, which, allomorphic, variation, was, expressed, e, g, ba, gi, 4, e, or, ba, gi, 4, i, for, they, returned, while, early, sumerian, writing, was, highly, logographic, there, was, a, tendency, towards, more, phonetic, spelling, in, the, neo, sumerian, period, consistent, syllabic, spelling, was, employed, when, writing, down, the, emesal, dialect, since, the, usual, logograms, would, have, been, read, in, emegir, by, default, for, the, purpose, of, teaching, the, language, and, often, in, recording, incantations, as, already, mentioned, texts, written, in, the, archaic, sumerian, period, are, difficult, to, interpret, because, they, often, omit, grammatical, elements, and, determinatives, in, addition, many, literary, mythological, texts, from, that, period, use, a, special, orthographic, style, called, ud, gal, nun, which, seems, to, be, based, on, substitution, of, certain, signs, or, groups, of, signs, for, others, for, example, the, three, signs, ud, gal, and, nun, which, the, system, is, named, for, are, substituted, for, an, en, and, lil, 2, respectively, producing, the, name, of, the, god, d, en, lil, 2, the, motivation, for, this, practice, is, mysterious, it, has, been, suggested, that, it, was, a, kind, of, cryptography, texts, written, in, ud, gal, nun, are, still, understood, very, poorly, and, only, partially, ever, since, its, decipherment, research, of, sumerian, has, been, made, difficult, not, only, by, the, lack, of, any, native, speakers, but, also, by, the, relative, sparseness, of, linguistic, data, the, apparent, lack, of, a, closely, related, language, and, the, features, of, the, writing, system, a, further, oft, mentioned, and, paradoxical, problem, for, the, study, of, sumerian, is, that, the, most, numerous, and, varied, texts, written, in, the, most, phonetically, explicit, and, precise, orthography, are, only, dated, to, periods, when, the, scribes, themselves, were, no, longer, native, speakers, and, often, demonstrably, had, less, than, perfect, command, of, the, language, they, were, writing, in, conversely, for, much, of, the, time, during, which, sumerian, was, still, a, living, language, the, surviving, sources, are, few, unvaried, and, or, written, in, an, orthography, that, is, more, difficult, to, interpret, typologically, sumerian, is, classified, as, an, agglutinative, ergative, consistently, so, in, its, nominal, morphology, and, split, ergative, in, its, verbal, morphology, and, subject, object, verb, language, the, sumerian, noun, is, typically, a, one, or, two, syllable, root, igi, eye, e, 2, house, household, nin, lady, although, there, are, also, some, roots, with, three, syllables, like, akanka, market, there, are, two, semantically, predictable, grammatical, genders, which, have, traditionally, been, called, animate, and, inanimate, although, these, names, do, not, express, their, membership, exactly, as, explained, below, the, adjectives, and, other, modifiers, follow, the, noun, lugal, ma, great, king, the, noun, itself, is, not, inflected, rather, grammatical, markers, attach, to, the, noun, phrase, as, a, whole, in, a, certain, order, typically, that, order, would, be, an, example, may, be, dig, ir, god, gal, gal, g, u, ene, ra, great, redup, 1, poss, pl, an, dat, dig, ir, gal, gal, g, u, ene, ra, god, great, redup, 1, poss, pl, an, dat, for, my, great, gods, the, possessive, plural, and, case, markers, are, traditionally, referred, to, as, suffixes, but, have, recently, also, been, described, as, enclitics, or, postpositions, the, two, genders, have, been, variously, called, animate, and, inanimate, human, and, non, human, or, personal, person, and, impersonal, non, person, their, assignment, is, semantically, predictable, the, first, gender, includes, humans, and, gods, while, the, second, one, includes, animals, plants, non, living, objects, abstract, concepts, and, groups, of, humans, since, the, second, gender, includes, animals, the, use, of, the, terms, animate, and, inanimate, is, somewhat, misleading, and, conventional, but, it, is, most, common, in, the, literature, so, it, will, be, maintained, in, this, article, there, are, some, minor, deviations, from, the, gender, assignment, rules, for, example, 1, the, word, for, alan, statue, may, be, treated, as, animate, 2, words, for, slaves, such, as, geme, 2, slave, woman, and, sag, head, used, in, its, secondary, sense, of, slave, may, be, treated, as, inanimate, 3, in, fable, like, contexts, which, occur, frequently, in, sumerian, proverbs, animals, are, usually, treated, as, animate, the, plural, marker, proper, is, e, ne, it, is, used, only, with, nouns, of, the, animate, gender, and, its, use, is, optional, it, is, often, omitted, when, other, parts, of, the, clause, indicate, the, plurality, of, the, referent, thus, it, is, not, used, if, the, noun, is, modified, by, a, numeral, lu, 2, e, 5, three, men, it, has, also, been, observed, that, until, the, ur, iii, period, the, marker, generally, isn, t, used, in, a, noun, phrase, in, the, absolutive, case, unless, this, is, necessary, for, disambiguation, instead, the, plurality, of, the, absolutive, participant, is, commonly, expressed, only, by, the, form, of, the, verb, in, the, clause, e, g, lu, 2, ba, za, 3, za, 3, e, the, men, ran, away, lu, 2, mu, u, 3, dab, 5, be, 2, e, i, caught, the, men, the, plural, marker, is, not, used, when, referring, to, a, group, of, people, because, a, group, of, people, is, treated, as, inanimate, e, g, engar, farmer, with, no, plural, marker, may, refer, to, the, group, of, farmers, as, the, following, example, shows, the, marker, is, appended, to, the, end, of, the, phrase, even, after, a, relative, clause, lu, man, e, a, house, in, ba, dab, a, e, ne, mid, catch, nmlz, pl, an, lu, e, a, ba, dab, a, e, ne, man, house, in, mid, catch, nmlz, pl, an, the, men, who, were, caught, in, the, house, likewise, the, plural, marker, is, usually, albeit, not, always, added, only, once, when, a, whole, series, of, coordinated, nouns, have, plural, reference, engar, farmer, sipad, shepherd, uku, ene, fisherman, pl, an, engar, sipad, uku, ene, farmer, shepherd, fisherman, pl, an, farmers, shepherds, and, fishermen, another, way, in, which, a, kind, of, plurality, is, expressed, is, by, means, of, reduplication, of, the, noun, dig, ir, dig, ir, gods, ib, 2, ib, 2, hips, however, this, construction, is, usually, considered, to, have, a, more, specialized, meaning, variously, interpreted, as, totality, all, the, gods, both, of, my, hips, or, distribution, separateness, each, of, the, gods, taken, separately, an, especially, frequently, occurring, reduplicated, word, kur, kur, foreign, lands, may, have, simply, plural, meaning, and, in, very, late, usage, the, meaning, of, the, reduplication, in, general, might, be, simple, plurality, at, least, a, few, adjectives, notably, gal, great, and, tur, small, are, also, reduplicated, when, the, noun, they, modify, has, plural, reference, a, gal, gal, the, great, waters, in, that, case, the, noun, itself, is, not, reduplicated, this, is, sometimes, interpreted, as, an, expression, of, simple, plurality, while, a, minority, view, is, that, the, meaning, of, these, forms, is, not, purely, plural, but, rather, the, same, as, that, of, noun, reduplication, two, other, ways, of, expressing, plurality, are, characteristic, only, of, very, late, sumerian, usage, and, have, made, their, way, into, sumerograms, used, in, writing, akkadian, and, other, languages, one, is, used, with, inanimate, nouns, and, consists, of, the, modification, of, the, noun, with, the, adjective, i, a, various, lit, mixed, e, g, udu, i, a, sheep, the, other, is, adding, the, 3rd, person, plural, form, of, the, enclitic, copula, me, e, to, a, noun, lugal, me, e, kings, originally, they, who, are, kings, the, generally, recognized, case, markers, are, the, final, vowels, of, most, of, the, above, markers, are, subject, to, loss, if, they, are, attached, to, vowel, final, words, in, addition, there, are, the, enclitic, particles, na, an, na, meaning, without, and, a, ka, nam, akanam, in, earlier, sumerian, or, a, ke, 4, e, 2, ake, because, of, in, later, sumerian, note, that, these, nominal, cases, enter, interact, with, the, so, called, dimensional, prefixes, of, the, verb, that, the, noun, modifies, producing, additional, meanings, while, the, dative, and, directive, are, in, complementary, distribution, in, the, noun, they, can, nevertheless, be, distinguished, when, the, verbal, prefixes, are, taken, into, account, likewise, whereas, the, meanings, in, to, and, on, to, are, expressed, by, the, same, nominal, case, they, can, be, disambiguated, by, the, verbal, prefixes, this, is, explained, in, more, detail, in, the, section, on, dimensional, prefixes, additional, spatial, or, temporal, meanings, can, be, expressed, by, genitive, phrases, like, at, the, head, of, above, at, the, face, of, in, front, of, at, the, outer, side, of, because, of, etc, bar, outer, side, udu, sheep, ad, ak, a, white, gen, loc, bar, udu, ad, ak, a, outer, side, sheep, white, gen, loc, because, of, a, white, sheep, the, embedded, structure, of, the, noun, phrase, can, be, further, illustrated, with, the, following, phrase, sipad, shepherd, udu, sheep, siki, a, k, ak, ene, wool, gen, gen, pl, an, sipad, udu, siki, a, k, ak, ene, shepherd, sheep, wool, gen, gen, pl, an, shepherds, of, woolly, sheep, here, the, first, genitive, morpheme, a, k, subordinates, siki, wool, to, udu, sheep, and, the, second, subordinates, udu, siki, a, k, sheep, of, wool, or, woolly, sheep, to, sipad, shepherd, the, uses, of, the, ergative, and, absolutive, case, are, those, typical, of, ergative, languages, the, subject, of, an, intransitive, verb, such, as, come, is, in, the, same, case, as, the, object, of, a, transitive, verb, such, as, build, namely, the, so, called, absolutive, case, in, contrast, the, subject, of, a, transitive, verb, has, a, different, case, which, is, termed, ergative, this, can, be, illustrated, with, the, following, examples, lugal, king, abs, i, m, g, en, fin, ven, come, lugal, i, m, g, en, king, abs, fin, ven, come, the, king, came, lugal, e, king, erg, e, house, abs, i, n, du, fin, 3, an, a, build, lugal, e, e, i, n, du, king, erg, house, abs, fin, 3, an, a, build, the, king, built, a, house, in, contrast, with, the, verbal, morphology, sumerian, nominal, morphology, consistently, follows, this, ergative, principle, regardless, of, tense, aspect, person, and, mood, besides, the, general, meanings, of, the, case, forms, outlined, above, there, are, many, lexically, determined, and, more, or, less, unpredictable, uses, of, specific, cases, often, governed, by, a, certain, verb, in, a, certain, sense, for, the, government, of, phrasal, verbs, see, the, relevant, section, the, attested, personal, pronouns, are, the, stem, vowels, of, g, e, 26, e, and, ze, 2, are, assimilated, to, a, following, case, suffix, containing, a, and, then, have, the, forms, g, a, and, za, e, g, za, ra, to, you, sg, as, far, as, demonstrative, pronouns, are, concerned, sumerian, most, commonly, uses, the, enclitic, bi, to, express, the, meaning, this, there, are, rare, instances, of, other, demonstrative, enclitics, such, as, e, this, e, that, and, re, that, the, difference, between, the, three, has, been, explained, in, terms, of, increasing, distance, from, the, speaker, or, as, a, difference, between, proximity, to, the, speaker, proximity, to, the, listener, and, distance, from, both, akin, to, the, japanese, or, latin, three, term, demonstrative, system, the, independent, demonstrative, pronouns, are, ne, e, n, this, thing, and, ur, 5, that, thing, ne, n, might, also, be, used, as, another, enclitic, now, is, i, 3, ne, e, 2, or, a, da, al, for, then, and, there, the, declined, noun, phrases, ud, ba, at, that, time, and, ki, ba, at, that, place, are, used, so, is, ur,

been, made, to, find, a, difference, of, meaning, between, the, forms, with, and, without, a, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, form, with, a, expresses, a, kind, of, determination, e, g, zid, righteous, true, vs, zid, da, right, not, left, or, restrictiveness, e, g, e, 2, gibil, a, new, house, vs, e, 2, gibil, la, the, new, house, as, contrasted, with, the, old, one, a, the, newer, kind,

few, adjectives, like, gal, big, and, tur, small, appear, to, agree, in, number, with, a, preceding, noun, in, the, plural, by, reduplication, with, some, other, adjectives, the, meaning, seems, to,

is, ten, sixties, so, that, the, sumerian, lexical, numeral, system, is, sexagesimal, with, 10, as, a, subbase, the, cardinal, numerals, and, ways, of, forming, composite, numbers, are, as, follows, ordinal, numerals, are, formed, with, the, suffix, kam, ma, in, old, sumerian, and, kam, ma, with, the, final, vowel, still, surfacing, in, front, of, enclitics, in, subsequent, periods, however, a, cardinal, numeral, may, also, have, ordinal, meaning, sometimes, the, syntax, of, numerals, has, some, peculiarities, besides, just, being, placed, after, a, noun, like, other, modifiers, dumu, e, 5, three, children, which, may, however, also, be, written, 3, dumu, the, numeral, may, be, reinforced, by, the, copula, dumu, e, 5, am, 3, lit, the, children, being, three, finally, there, is, a, third, construction, in, which, the, possessive, pronoun, bi, is, added, after, the, numeral, which, gives, the, whole, phrase, a, definite, meaning, dumu, e, 5, a, bi, the, three, children, lit, children, the, three, of, them, the, numerals, min, two, and, e, 5, three, are, also, supplied, with, the, nominalizing, marker, a, before, the, pronoun, as, the, above, example, shows, fractions, are, formed, with, the, phrase, n, igi, n, g, al, 2, one, nth, where, g, al, 2, may, be, omitted, one, half, however, is, u, ru, a, later, u, ri, a, another, way, of, expressing, fractions, was, originally, limited, to, weight, measures, specifically, fractions, of, the, mina, ma, na, u, ana, one, third, literarlly, two, sixths, anabi, two, thirds, the, former, two, words, are, of, akkadian, origins,

the, sumerian, finite, verb, distinguishes, a, number, of, moods, and, agrees, more, or, less, consistently, with, the, subject, and, the, object, in, person, number, and, gender, the, verb, chain, may, also, incorporate, pronominal, references, to, the, verb, s, other, modifiers, which, has, also, traditionally, been, described, as, agreement, although, in, fact, such, a, reference, and, the, presence, of, an, actual, modifier, in, the, clause, need, not, co, occur, not, only, e, 2, e, 3, i, b, 2, i, du, un, i, m, going, to, the, house, but, also, e, 2, e, 3, i, 3, du, un, i, m, going, to, the, house, and, simply, i, b, 2, i, du, un, i, m, going, to, it, are, possible, hence, the, term, cross, reference, instead, of, agreement, has, been, proposed, this, article, will, predominantly, use, the, term, agreement, the, sumerian, verb, also, makes, a, binary, distinction, according, to, a, category, that, some, regard, as, tense, past, vs, present, future, others, as, aspect, perfective, vs, imperfective, and, that, will, be, designated, as, ta, tense, aspect, in, the, following, the, two, members, of, the, opposition, entail, different, conjugation, patterns, and, at, least, for, many, verbs, different, stems, they, are, theory, neutrally, referred, to, with, the, akkadian, grammatical, terms, for, the, two, respective, forms, am, u, quick, and, mar, slow, fat, finally, opinions, differ, on, whether, the, verb, has, a, passive, or, a, middle, voice, and, how, it, is, expressed, it, is, often, pointed, out, that, a, sumerian, verb, does, not, seem, to, be, strictly, limited, to, only, transitive, or, only, intransitive, usage, e, g, the, verb, kur, 9, can, mean, both, enter, and, insert, bring, in, and, the, verb, de, 2, can, mean, both, flow, out, and, pour, out, this, depends, simply, on, whether, an, ergative, participant, causing, the, event, is, explicitly, mentioned, in, the, clause, and, in, the, agreement, markers, on, the, verb, some, have, even, concluded, that, instead, of, speaking, about, intransitive, and, transitive, verbs, it, may, be, better, to, speak, only, of, intransitive, and, transitive, constructions, in, sumerian, the, verbal, root, is, almost, always, a, monosyllable, and, together, with, various, affixes, forms, a, so, called, verbal, chain, which, is, described, as, a, sequence, of, about, 15, slots, though, the, precise, models, differ, the, finite, verb, has, both, prefixes, and, suffixes, while, the, non, finite, verb, may, only, have, suffixes, broadly, the, prefixes, have, been, divided, in, three, groups, that, occur, in, the, following, order, modal, prefixes, conjugation, prefixes, and, pronominal, and, dimensional, prefixes, the, suffixes, are, a, future, or, imperfective, marker, ed, pronominal, suffixes, and, an, a, ending, that, nominalizes, the, whole, verb, chain, the, overall, structure, can, be, summarized, as, follows, morphemes, nu, la, a, m, da, ta, i, i, ni, enden, enzen, ene, e, examples, using, most, of, the, above, slots, may, be, a, prec, mu, ven, nn, 3, sg, an, a, dat, b, 3, inan, o, um, give, ene, 3, pl, an, a, s, ipfv, a, mu, nn, a, b, um, ene, prec, ven,

verb, chain, if, so, the, prefixes, are, placed, in, a, specific, order, which, is, shown, the, section, dimensional, prefixes, below, the, conjugation, prefixes, appear, to, be, mutually, exclusive, to, a, great, extent, since, the, finite, prefixes, i, e, and, a, do, not, appear, before, ba, and, the, sequence, b, i, nor, does, the, realization, appear, before, ba, or, b, i, however, it, is, commonly, assumed, that, the, spellings, im, im, ma, and, im, mi, are, equivalent, to, i, mu, i, mu, ba, and, i, mu, bi, respectively, according, to, jagersma, the, reason, for, the, restrictions, is, that, the, finite, prefixes, i, e, and, a, have, been, elided, prehistorically, in, open, syllables, in, front, of, prefixes, of, the, shape, cv, consonant, vowel, the, exception, is, the, position, in, front, of, the, locative, prefix, ni, the, second, person, dative, r, a, and, the, second, person, directive, r, i, where, the, dominant, dialect, of, the, old, babylonian, period, retains, them, the, modal, prefixes, express, modality, some, of, them, are, generally, combined, with, certain, tas, in, other, cases, the, meaning, of, a, modal, prefix, can, depend, on, the, ta, e, g, in, gu, 7, i, n, gu, he, ate, it, e, g, nu, u, 3, un, gu, 7, nu, i, n, gu, he, didn, t, eat, it, e, g, e, 2, eb, gu, 7, e, a, ib, gu, 7, e, let, him, eat, it, a, an, gu, 7, he, ate, it, indeed, e, g, ga, ab, gu, 7, let, me, eat, it, e, g, u, n, gu, 7, if, when, he, eats, it, e, g, na, ab, gu, 7, e, he, must, not, eat, it, na, an, gu, 7, he, ate, it, indeed, e, g, ba, ra, ab, gu, 7, en, i, certainly, will, not, eat, it, ba, ra, an, gu, 7, he, certainly, didn, t, eat, it, e, g, nu, u, ib, 2, gu, 7, e, if, only, he, would, eat, it, e, g, i, in, gu, 7, so, correspondingly, accordingly, he, ate, it, although, the, modal, prefixes, are, traditionally, grouped, together, in, one, slot, in, the, verbal, chain, their, behaviour, suggests, a, certain, difference, in, status, only, nu, and, a, exhibit, morphophonemic, evidence, of, co, occurring, with, a, following, finite, conjugation, prefix, while, the, others, do, not, and, hence, seem, to, be, mutually, exclusive, with, it, for, this, reason, jagersma, separates, the, first, two, as, proclitics, and, groups, the, others, together, with, the, finite, prefix, as, non, proclitic, preformatives, the, meaning, structure, identity, and, even, the, number, of, the, various, conjugation, prefixes, have, always, been, a, subject, of, disagreements, the, term, conjugation, prefix, simply, alludes, to, the, fact, that, a, sumerian, finite, verb, in, the, indicative, mood, must, nearly, always, contain, one, of, them, which, of, these, prefixes, is, used, seems, to, have, more, often, than, not, no, effect, on, its, translation, into, european, languages, proposed, explanations, of, the, choice, of, conjugation, prefix, usually, revolve, around, the, subtleties, of, spatial, grammar, information, structure, focus, verb, valency, and, most, recently, voice, the, following, description, primarily, follows, the, analysis, of, jagersma, 2010, largely, seconded, by, z, lyomi, 2017, and, sallaberger, 2023, in, its, specifics, nonetheless, most, of, the, interpretations, in, it, are, held, widely, if, not, universally, e, g, i, n, e, 6, i, n, e, he, brought, it, e, g, al, e, 6, it, is, was, brought, e, g, mu, un, e, 6, he,

g, im, mi, in, e, 6, he, made, it, the, ox, the, group, of, workers, bring, it, here, im, ma, e, 6, it, was, brought, here, the, rare, prefix, nga, means, also, equally, often, written, without, the, initial, n, especially, in, earlier, periods, it, is, of, crucial, importance, for, the, ordering, of, the, conjugation, prefixes, because, it, is, usually, placed, between, the, conjugation, prefix, i, and, the, pronominal, prefix, e, g, i, n, ga, an, zu, he, too, knows, it, but, it, precedes, the, conjugation, prefix, mu, na, ga, mu, zu, he, also, understood, it, this, suggests, that, these, two, conjugation, prefixes, must, belong, to, different, slots, although, a, conjugation, prefix, is, almost, always, present, sumerian, until, the, old, babylonian, period, allows, a, finite, verb, to, begin, directly, with, the, locative, prefix, ni, the, second, person, singular, dative, r, a, or, the, second, person, directive, r, i, see, below, because, the, prefixes, i, 3, e, and, a, are, apparently, elided, in, front, of, them, the, dimensional, prefixes, of, the, verb, chain, basically, correspond, to, and, often, repeat, the, case, markers, of, the, noun, phrase, like, the, case, markers, of, the, noun, phrase, the, first, dimensional, prefix, is, normally, attached, to, a, preceding, head, a, pronominal, prefix, which, expresses, the, person, gender, and, number, of, its, referent, the, first, dimensional, prefix, may, be, followed, by, up, to, two, other, dimensional, prefixes, but, unlike, the, first, one, these, prefixes, never, have, an, explicit, head, and, cannot, refer, to, animate, nouns, the, other, slot, where, a, pronominal, prefix, can, occur, is, immediately, before, the, stem, where, it, can, have, a, different, allomorph, and, expresses, the, person, gender, and, absolutive, or, the, ergative, participant, the, transitive, subject, the, intransitive, subject, or, the, direct, object, depending, on, the, ta, and, other, factors, as, explained, below, there, is, some, variation, in, the, extent, to, which, the, verb, of, a, clause, that, contains, a, noun, in, a, given, case, also, contains, the, corresponding, pronominal, and, dimensional, prefixes, in, the, verb, the, ergative, participant, is, always, expressed, in, the, verb, as, is, generally, the, absolutive, one, with, some, vacillation, for, the, third, person, singular, inanimate, in, transitive, forms, as, explained, below, the, dative, comitative, the, locative, and, directive, participant, used, in, a, local, meaning, also, tend, to, be, expressed, relatively, consistently, with, the, ablative, and, terminative, on, the, other, hand, there, is, considerable, variability, there, are, some, cases, specified, below, where, the, meanings, of, the, cases, in, the, noun, phrase, and, in, the, verb, diverge, so, a, noun, case, enclitic, may, not, be, reflected, in, the, verb, or, conversely, a, verb, may, have, a, prefix, that, has, no, specific, reference, in, the, clause, or, in, reality, the, forms, of, the, pronominal, prefixes, are, the, following, e, before, a, consonant, e, is, assimilated, to, the, preceding, vowel, lengthening, it, e, g, mu, e, mu, u, 3, etc, in, the, dialects, attested, before, the, old, babylonian, period, in, the, old, babylonian, dialect, e, is, preserved, e, g, mu, e, and, the, preceding, vowel, may, assimilate, to, the, e, instead, e, g, m, e, as, in, the, singular, the, 3rd, person, animate, form, begins, in, a, geminate, nn, according, to, jagersma, and, others, animate, only, confusingly, the, subject, and, object, prefixes, n, b, e, v, are, not, commonly, spelled, out, in, early, texts, as, both, coda, consonants, and, vowel, length, are, often, ignored, in, them, the, full, spellings, do, become, more, usual, during, the, third, dynasty, of, ur, in, the, neo, sumerian, period, and, especially, during, the, old, babylonian, period, thus, in, earlier, texts, one, finds, mu, ak, and, i, 3, ak, e, ak, in, southern, sumerian, instead, of, mu, un, ak, and, in, ak, for, mu, n, ak, and, i, n, ak, he, she, made, and, also, mu, ak, instead, of, neo, sumerian, mu, u, 3, ak, or, old, babylonian, mu, e, ak, you, made, vowel, length, never, came, to, be, expressed, systematically, so, the, 1st, person, prefix, was, often, graphically, during, the, entire, existence, of, sumerian, the, generally, recognized, dimensional, prefixes, are, shown, in, the, table, below, if, several, occur, within, the, same, verb, complex, they, are, placed, in, the, order, they, are, listed, in, the, ablative, does, not, co, occur, with, the, terminative, and, the, directive, does, not, co, occur, with, the, locative, so, these, pairs, may, be, argued, to, share, the, same, slot, accordingly, the, template, can, be, said, to, include, the, following, dimensional, slots, dative, comitative, ablative, terminative, directive, locative, a, major, exception, from, the, general, system, of, personal, and, dimensional, prefixes, is, the, very, frequent, prefix, ni, in, there, which, corresponds, to, a, noun, phrase, in, the, locative, but, doesn, t, seem, to, be, preceded, by, any, pronominal, prefix, and, has, demonstrative, meaning, by, itself, this, prefix, is, not, to, be, confused, with, the, homographic, sequence, ni, which, corresponds, to, an, animate, noun, phrase, in, the, directive, in, the, latter, case, ni, is, analysed, as, a, combination, of, pronominal, nn, and, directive, i, roughly, at, him, her, on, him, her, etc, whereas, in, the, former, ni, is, unanalysable, an, example, of, a, verb, chain, where, several, dimensional, slots, are, occupied, can, be, i, fin, nn, 3, sg, an, a, dat, ta, abl, ni, loc, n, 3, an, a, ed, go, out, i, nn, a, ta, ni, n, ed, fin, 3, sg, an, dat, abl, loc, 3, an, a, go, out, he, made, it, the, dike, go, out, of, it, a, canal, for, him, into, it, a, locality, the, comitative, prefix, da, can, in, addition, express, the, meaning, to, be, able, to, in, that, case, there, is, a, preceding, pronominal, prefix, agreeing, with, the, subject, of, the, action, e, g, nu, mu, e, da, n, dab, en, you, cannot, catch, him, lit, you, won, t, catch, him, with, yourself, the, directive, has, the, meaning, on, to, when, the, verb, is, combined, with, a, noun, in, the, locative, case, e, g, ban, ur, a, ninda, b, i, b, g, a, g, a, en, i, will, put, bread, on, the, table, while, the, meanings, of, the, prefixes, are, generally, the, same, as, those, of, the, corresponding, nominal, case, markers, there, are, some, differences, at, the, systemic, level, there, are, some, asymmetries, between, the, nominal, case, markers, and, the, verbal, dimensional, prefixes, they, partly, make, different, distinctions, and, the, nominal, case, marking, is, influenced, by, animacy, because, of, these, mismatches, different, meanings, are, expressed, by, combinations, of, matching, or, non, matching, noun, cases, and, verb, prefixes, the, combinations, may, be, summarized, as, follows, inanimate, animate, inanimate, in, to, he, placed, it, in, the, house, on, to, he, placed, it, on, the, house, he, placed, it, on, the, man, at, causee, he, touched, the, house, he, touched, the, man, he, gave, it, to, the, house, he, gave, it, to, the, man, in, some, cases, there, are, also, mismatches, between, nominal, and, verbal, markers, when, exact, correspondences, would, have, been, possible, these, may, serve, to, express, additional, shades, of, meaning, a, dative, noun, case, marker, and, terminative, dimensional, prefix, may, co, occur, in, the, ur, iii, period, in, general, from, that, time, on, the, choice, of, noun, cases, begins, to, be, influenced, by, the, government, of, corresponding, akkadian, verbs, while, the, verbs, themselves, retain, their, older, prefixes, according, to, foxvog, ni, can, resume, non, locative, cases, such, as, the, terminative, and, the, dative, a, peculiar, pattern, of, agreement, occurs, in, what, has, been, referred, to, as, an, external, possession, construction, in, which, a, modifier, of, the, verb, refers, to, a, certain, object, almost, always, a, body, part, but, it, is, emphasised, that, the, action, affects, the, possessor, of, that, object, cf, english, he, hit, me, on, the, head, in, that, case, the, verb, may, agree, with, the, possessor, with, the, directive, prefix, while, not, agreeing, with, the, object, itself, thus, he, put, barley, in, your, hand, may, be, expressed, by, u, z, u, a, e, i, r, i, n, g, ar, lit, he, put, barley, at, you, in, your, hand, alternatively, it, may, agree, with, both, the, possessor, and, the, object, the, possessor, is, then, referred, to, by, the, dative, prefix, u, z, u, a, e, i, r, a, ni, n, g, ar, lit, he, put, barley, to, you, in, there, in, your, hand, when, the, dimensional, prefix, is, dative, a, the, personal, prefix, of, the, 1st, person, appears, to, be, absent, but, the, 1st, person, reference, is, expressed, by, the, choice, of, the, ventive, conjugation, prefix, mu, the, sequence, that, expresses, the, 1st, person, dative, is, then, mu, a, ma, when, the, intended, meaning, is, that, of, the, directive, i, e, on, me, in, contact, with, me, etc, it, seems, that, the, ventive, conjugation, prefix, mu, alone, serves, to, express, it, two, special, phenomena, occur, if, there, is, no, absolutive, ergative, pronominal, prefix, in, the, pre, stem, position, 1, the, sequences, ni, locative, ni, and, personal, directive, nn, i, and, bi, personal, directive, b, i, acquire, the, forms, n, and, b, coinciding, with, the, absolutive, ergative, pronominal, prefixes, before, the, stem, if, there, isn, t, already, an, absolutive, ergative, pronominal, prefix, in, pre, stem, position, this, is, typically, the, case, when, the, verb, is, used, intransitively, for, example, the, normal, appearance, of, ni, is, seen, in, in, contrast, in, an, intransitive, form, we, find, a, syncopated, realization, the, preceding, vowel, undergoes, compensatory, lengthening, which, is, sometimes, indicated, by, its, doubling, in, the, spelling, likewise, the, normal, realisation, of, bi, is, seen, in, this, is, to, be, contrasted, with, the, syncopated, version, in, an, intransitive, form, the, same, phonological, pattern, is, claimed, to, account, for, the, alternation, between, the, forms, of, the, ventive, prefix, the, standard, appearance, is, seen, in, i, mu, n, ak, mu, un, ak, he, did, it, here, in, an, intransitive, form, however, we, find, i, mu, g, en, i, 3, im, g, en, he, came, here, a, superficially, very, similar, but, distinct, phenomenon, is, that, if, there, isn, t, already, an, absolutive, ergative, pronominal, prefix, in, pre, stem, position, the, personal, prefix, of, the, directive, participant, does, not, receive, the, dimensional, prefix, i, e, at, all, and, is, moved, to, the, pre, stem, position, for, example, the, normal, position, of, the, directive, participant, is, seen, in, in, contrast, in, an, intransitive, form, we, find, in, the, same, way, the, normal, position, is, seen, in, this, can, be, contrasted, with, an, intransitive, form, in, some, cases, the, 3rd, person, inanimate, prefix, b, appears, to, be, unexpectedly, absent, the, pronominal, suffixes, are, as, follows, animate, only, the, initial, vowel, in, all, of, the, above, suffixes, can, be, assimilated, to, the, vowel, of, the, verb, root, more, specifically, it, can, become, u, or, i, if, the, vowel, of, the, verb, root, is, u, or, i, respectively, it, can, also, undergo, contraction, with, an, immediately, preceding, vowel, pre, ur, iii, texts, also, spell, the, first, and, second, person, suffix, en, as, e, making, it, coincide, with, the, third, person, in, the, mar, form, sumerian, verbal, agreement, follows, a, nominative, accusative, pattern, in, the, 1st, and, 2nd, persons, of, the, mar, tense, aspect, but, an, ergative, absolutive, pattern, in, most, other, forms, of, the, indicative, mood, because, of, this, presence, of, both, patterns, sumerian, is, considered, a, language, with, split, ergativity, the, general, principle, is, that, in, the, am, u, ta, the, transitive, subject, is, expressed, by, the, prefix, and, the, direct, object, by, the, suffix, and, in, the, mar, ta, it, is, the, other, way, round, for, example, i, b, dab, en, can, be, a, am, u, form, meaning, it, caught, me, where, b, expresses, the, subject, it, and, en, expresses, the, object, i, however, it, can, also, be, a, mar, form, meaning, i, will, catch, it, where, en, expresses, the, subject, i, and, b, expresses, the, object, it, as, for, the, intransitive, subject, it, is, expressed, in, both, tas, by, the, suffixes, for, example, i, ka, en, is, i, ran, and, i, ka, ed, en, can, be, i, will, run, this, means, that, the, intransitive, subject, is, treated, like, the, object, in, am, u, which, makes, the, am, u, pattern, ergative, and, like, the, subject, in, mar, which, makes, the, mar, pattern, nominative, accusative, there, are, two, exceptions, from, the, above, generalization, 1, a, transitive, subject, of, the, third, person, in, mar, uses, unique, suffixes, that, are, not, the, same, as, those, of, the, intransitive, subject, and, the, am, u, direct, object, for, example, while, they, ran, can, be, i, ka, e, just, as, it, caught, them, can, be, i, b, dab, e, the, corresponding, form, for, they, will, catch, it, would, be, i, b, dab, ene, this, pattern, can, be, described, as, a, case, of, tripartite, alignment, 2, a, plural, transitive, subject, in, the, am, u, ta, is, expressed, not, only, by, the, prefix, but, also, by, the, suffix, e, g, i, n, dab, e, can, mean, they, caught, it, specifically, the, prefix, expresses, only, the, person, while, the, suffix, expresses, both, the, person, and, the, number, of, the, subject, note, that, the, prefixes, of, the, plural, transitive, subject, are, identical, to, those, of, the, singular, v, e, n, as, opposed, to, the, special, plural, forms, me, e, ne, ne, found, in, non, pre, stem, position, the, use, of, the, personal, affixes, for, subjects, and, direct, objects, can, be, summarized, as, follows, animate, examples, for, ta, and, pronominal, agreement, am, u, is, rendered, with, past, tense, mar, with, present, the, verbal, stem, itself, can, also, express, grammatical, distinctions, within, the, categories, number, and, tense, aspect, in, a, number, of, verbs, this, involves, suppletion, or, morphonological, alternations, that, are, not, fully, predictable, 1, with, respect, to, number, plurality, can, be, expressed, by, complete, reduplication, of, the, am, u, stem, e, g, kur, 9, kur, 9, enter, pl, or, by, a, suppletive, stem, e, g, gub, stand, sing, sug, 2, stand, pl, the, traditional, view, is, that, both, of, these, morphological, means, express, plurality, of, the, absolutive, participant, in, sumerian, however, it, has, often, been, pointed, out, that, complete, reduplication, of, the, verb, in, sumerian, can, also, express, plurality, of, the, action, itself, intensity, or, iterativity, and, that, it, is, not, obligatory, in, the, presence, of, plural, participants, but, rather, seems, to, expressly, emphasize, the, plurality, according, to, some, researchers, the, predominant, meaning, of, the, suppletive, plural, stem, is, indeed, plurality, of, the, most, affected, participants, whereas, the, predominant, meaning, of, complete, reduplication, is, plurality, of, events, because, they, occur, at, multiple, times, or, locations, however, even, with, suppletive, plural, stems, the, singular, may, occur, with, a, plural, participant, presumably, because, the, event, is, perceived, as, a, single, one, 2, with, respect, to, tense, aspect, marking, verbs, are, divided, in, four, types, am, u, is, always, the, unmarked, ta, the, following, tables, show, some, of, the, most, frequent, stem, alternations, before, the, pronominal, suffixes, a, suffix, ed, or, d, can, be, inserted, the, d, is, only, realized, if, other, vowels, follow, in, which, case, the, e, in, turn, may, be, elided, e, g, i, 3, za, 3, e, de, 3, en, i, za, ed, en, i, will, must, escape, i, 3, za, 3, e, i, za, ed, he, will, must, escape, this, suffix, is, considered, to, account, for, occurrences, of, e, in, the, third, person, singular, mar, of, intransitive, forms, by, those, who, do, not, accept, the, theory, that, e, itself, is, a, mar, stem, formant, the, function, of, the, suffix, is, somewhat, controversial, some, view, it, as, having, a, primarily, modal, meaning, of, must, or, can, or, future, meaning, others, believe, that, it, primarily, signals, simply, the, imperfective, status, of, a, verb, form, i, e, a, mar, form, although, its, presence, is, obligatory, only, in, intransitive, mar, forms, and, in, non, finite, forms, in, intransitive, forms, it, thus, helps, to, distinguish, mar, from, am, u, for, instance, in, the, above, example, i, 3, za, 3, en, alone, without, ed, could, have, been, interpreted, as, a, am, u, form, i, escaped, in, contrast, in, the, analysis, of, scholars, who, do, not, believe, that, ed, is, obligatory, in, mar, many, intransitive, forms, like, i, 3, za, 3, en, can, be, both, am, u, and, mar, the, vowel, e, of, this, suffix, undergoes, the, same, allophonic, changes, as, the, initial, e, of, the, person, suffixes, it, is, regularly, assimilated, to, u, in, front, of, stems, containing, the, vowel, u, and, a, following, labial, consonant, r, or, l, e, g, um, 2, mu, d, um, ed, it, is, also, assimilated, and, contracted, with, immediately, preceding, vowels, e, g, gi, 4, gi, 4, gi, gi, i, d, gi, gi, ed, which, will, should, return, the, verb, du, go, never, takes, the, suffix, jagersma, systematizes, the, use, of, the, tense, aspect, forms, in, the, following, patterns, in, addition, different, moods, often, require, either, a, am, u, or, a, mar, stem, and, either, a, am, u, or, a, mar, agreement, pattern, depending, on, various, conditions, as, specified, in, the, relevant, sections, above, and, below, in, more, general, terms, modern, scholars, usually, state, that, the, difference, between, the, two, forms, is, primarily, one, of, aspect, am, u, expresses, perfective, aspect, i, e, a, completed, action, or, sometimes, possibly, punctual, aspect, whereas, mar, expresses, imperfective, aspect, i, e, a, non, completed, action, or, sometimes, possibly, durative, aspect, in, contrast, the, time, at, which, the, action, takes, place, or, at, which, it, is, completed, or, non, completed, is, not, specified, and, may, be, either, past, present, or, future, this, contrasts, with, the, earlier, view, prevalent, in, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, according, to, which, the, difference, was, one, of, tense, am, u, was, thought, to, express, the, past, preterite, tense, and, mar, was, considered, to, express, present, future, tense, while, the, use, of, mar, with, past, tense, reference, was, viewed, as, a, stylistic, device, cf, the, so, called, historical, present, use, in, other, languages, indeed, it, has, been, pointed, out, that, a, translation, of, am, u, with, past, tense, and, mar, with, present, or, future, tense, does, work, well, most, of, the, time, this, may, correspond, to, the, cases, in, which, the, action, was, viewed, by, sumerian, speakers, as, completed, or, non, completed, with, respect, to, the, present, moment, the, imperative, mood, construction, is, produced, with, a, am, u, stem, but, using, the, mar, agreement, pattern, by, turning, all, prefixes, into, suffixes, in, the, plural, the, second, person, plural, ending, is, attached, in, a, form, that, differs, slightly, from, the, indicative, it, is, n, zen, with, the, n, appearing, only, after, vowels, the, stem, is, singular, even, in, the, plural, imperative, compare, the, following, indicative, imperative, pairs, mu, ven, nn, 3, sg, an, a, dat, b, 3, inan, o, um, give, e, 3, an, a, mu, nn, a, b, um, e, ven, 3, sg, an, dat, 3, inan, o, give, 3, an, a, he, will, give, it, to, him, here, um, give, mu, ven, nn, 3, sg, an, a, dat, b, 3, inan, o, um, mu, nn, a, b, give, ven, 3, sg, an, dat, 3, inan, o, give, it, to, him, here, mu, ven, nn, 3, sg, an, a, dat, b, 3, inan, o, um, give, enzen, 2, pl, mu, nn, a, b,

give, ven, 3, sg, an, dat, 3, inan, o, 2, pl, a, s, imp, give, plur, it, to, him, here, this, may, be, compared, with, the, french, pair, vous, le, lui, donnez, but, donnez, le, lui, in, addition, the, prefix, i, 3, is, replaced, by, a, i, 3, g, en, he, went, but, g, en, n, a, go, in, na, ab, be2, he, will, say, it, to, him, but, dug, 4, g, a, an, na, ab, say, it, to, him, however, the, vowel, e, and, possibly, i, occasionally, also, occur, if, no, further, prefixes, follow, perhaps, as, a, characteristic, of, southern, dialects, the, ventive, prefix, mu, if, not, followed, by, others, has, the, form, um, in, the, imperative, e, 6, um, bring, it, here, in, old, babylonian, texts, the, reduced, form, u, and, the, more, regular, am, a, m, are, also, found, g, e, 26, nu, g, en, am, 3, both, come, here, sumerian, participles, can, function, both, as, verbal, adjectives, and, as, verbal, nouns, as, verbal, adjectives, they, can, describe, any, participant, involved, in, the, action, or, state, expressed, by, the, verb, for, instance, um, 2, ma, may, mean, either, which, was, given, to, someone, who, was, given, something, or, who, gave, as, verbal, nouns, they, denote, the, action, or, state, itself, so, um, 2, ma, may, also, mean, the, act, of, giving, or, the, fact, that, x, gave, y, participles, are, formed, in, the, following, ways, the, copula, verb, me, to, be, is, mostly, used, in, an, enclitic, form, its, conjugation, is, as, follows, old, sumerian, am, 6, in, addition, the, initial, vowel, of, the, form, am, 3, is, reduced, to, m, after, enclitics, ending, in, a, vowel, e, 2, g, u, 10, u, m, it, is, my, house, like, other, final, consonants, the, m, may, not, be, expressed, in, early, spelling, these, enclitic, forms, are, used, instead, of, a, simple, sequence, of, finite, prefix, root, and, personal, suffix, i, 3, me, en, i, me, etc, for, more, complex, forms, the, independent, copula, form, is, used, i, 3, me, a, that, he, is, nu, u, 3, me, en, i, am, not, unlike, the, enclitic, it, typically, uses, the, normal, stem, me, in, the, 3rd, person, singular, ba, ra, me, should, not, be, except, for, the, form, prefixed, with, a, which, is, e, 2, em, or, e, 2, am, 3, for, a, negative, equivalent, of, the, copula, in, the, 3rd, person, it, seems, that, the, word, nu, not, alone, instead, of, nu, um, is, used, predicatively, e, g, urud, nu, it, is, not, copper, although, the, form, nu, un, ga, am, 3, it, is, also, not, is, attested, a, different, word, is, used, to, express, existence, or, being, present, located, somewhere, g, al, 2, a, peculiar, feature, of, the, copula, is, that, it, seems, to, form, a, relative, clause, without, the, nominalizing, suffix, a, and, thus, uses, the, finite, form, thus, instead, of, i, 3, me, a, simply, am, 3, is, used, kug, nig, 2, gur, 11, ra, ni, i, m, ma, an, um, 2, he, gave, me, silver, which, was, his, property, which, appears, to, say, the, silver, was, his, property, he, gave, it, to, me, in, the, negative, the, full, form, nu, me, a, which, is, not, is, used, and, likewise, in, non, relative, functions, some, scholars, believe, that, it, is, possible, to, speak, of, a, passive, voice, in, sumerian, jagersma, 2010, distinguishes, three, attested, passive, constructions, in, each, case, the, ergative, participant, and, the, corresponding, agreement, marker, on, the, verb, are, removed, so, that, the, verb, is, inflected, intransitively, but, there, may, also, be, some, additional, cues, to, ensure, a, passive, interpretation, the, passive, may, be, formed, the, agent, is, never, expressed, in, the, passive, clause, in, sumerian, while, the, existence, of, such, intransitive, constructions, of, normally, transitive, verbs, is, widely, recognized, some, other, scholars, have, disputed, the, view, that, these, constructions, should, be, called, passives, they, prefer, to, speak, of, one, participant, or, agentless, constructions, and, to, limit, themselves, to, the, observation, that, the, prefixes, ba, and, a, tend, to, be, preferred, with, such, constructions, apparently, as, a, secondary, effect, of, another, more, subtle, feature, of, their, meaning, concerning, the, history, of, the, constructions, it, has, been, claimed, that, the, passive, like, use, of, ba, does, not, appear, before, the, ur, iii, period, jagersma, on, the, contrary, states, that, it, is, attested, already, in, the, old, sumerian, period, although, it, becomes, especially, frequent, in, ur, iii, times, a, different, construction, has, been, posited, and, labelled, sumerian, passive, voice, by, a, significant, number, of, scholars, according, to, them, too, a, passive, is, formed, by, removing, the, ergative, participant, and, the, verbal, marker, that, agrees, with, it, but, the, verb, is, not, inflected, as, an, intransitive, one, instead, it, has, a, personal, prefix, which, refers, to, the, logical, object, e, i, b, u, or, e, ba, b, u, the, house, is, being, built, the, stem, is, always, am, u, some, consider, this, construction, to, have, only, the, function, and, meaning, of, a, mar, form, while, others, consider, the, tense, aspect, opposition, to, be, neutralized, in, it, the, personal, prefix, is, nearly, always, b, in, identified, cases, views, differ, on, whether, it, agrees, in, gender, with, an, animate, logical, object, appearing, as, n, or, whether, it, remains, b, critics, have, argued, that, most, alleged, examples, of, the, construction, are, actually, instances, of, the, pre, stem, personal, prefix, referring, to, the, directive, participant, in, an, intransitive, verb, at, least, before, the, old, babylonian, period, pascal, attinger, considers, it, plausible, that, the, original, construction, was, indeed, a, directive, one, whereas, its, new, passive, function, as, described, by, him, arose, via, a, reinterpretation, in, the, old, babylonian, period, walther, sallaberger, on, the, contrary, believes, this, kind, of, passive, to, be, characteristic, of, neo, sumerian, and, to, have, been, lost, in, old, babylonian, a, further, possibility, is, that, at, least, some, of, these, cases, actually, have, an, impersonal, 3rd, person, inanimate, subject, it, has, they, have, built, the, house, sumerian, doesn, t, have, dedicated, causative, morphology, causativity, is, expressed, syntactically, in, two, ways, depending, on, the, transitivity, of, the, verb, in, old, babylonian, sumerian, new, causative, markers, have, been, claimed, to, have, arisen, under, the, influence, of, akkadian, this, is, explained, in, the, section, on, interference, from, akkadian, and, other, late, phenomena, a, specific, problem, of, sumerian, syntax, is, posed, by, the, numerous, phrasal, verbs, traditionally, called, compound, verbs, in, sumerology, in, spite, of, the, fact, that, they, are, not, compounds, but, idiomatic, combinations, they, usually, involve, a, noun, immediately, before, the, verb, forming, a, lexical, idiomatic, unit, e, g, igi, du, 8, lit, open, the, eye, see, look, their, case, government, and, agreement, patterns, vary, depending, on, the, specific, verb, the, component, noun, is, usually, in, the, absolutive, case, but, may, be, in, the, directive, if, the, phrasal, verb, takes, another, noun, as, a, logical, object, the, verbal, infix, is, typically, the, directive, while, the, noun, case, is, most, commonly, either, the, directive, dative, if, animate, which, otherwise, has, the, meaning, at, with, respect, to, or, the, locative, dative, if, animate, which, otherwise, has, the, meaning, on, less, commonly, the, case, of, the, logical, object, and, the, pronominal, infix, may, be, another, possibility, is, for, the, component, noun, to, be, in, the, dative, directive, if, inanimate, while, the, object, is, in, the, absolutive, the, basic, word, order, is, subject, object, verb, verb, finality, is, only, violated, in, rare, instances, in, poetry, the, moving, of, a, constituent, towards, the, beginning, of, the, phrase, may, be, a, way, to, highlight, it, as, may, the, addition, of, the, copula, to, it, modifiers, adjectives, genitive, phrases, etc, are, normally, placed, after, the, noun, e, 2, gibil, a, new, house, e, 2, lugal, la, the, house, of, the, owner, however, the, so, called, anticipatory, genitive, e, 2, a, lugal, bi, the, owner, of, the, house, lit, of, the, house, its, owner, is, common, and, may, signal, the, possessor, s, topicality, there, are, no, adpositions, but, noun, phrases, in, a, certain, case, may, resemble, prepositions, and, have, a, similar, function, there, are, various, ways, to, express, subordination, many, of, them, include, the, nominalization, of, a, finite, verb, with, the, suffix, a, which, is, also, used, to, form, participles, as, shown, above, like, the, participles, this, nominalized, clause, can, either, modify, a, noun, as, adjectives, do, or, refer, to, the, event, itself, as, nouns, do, it, usually, functions, as, a, relative, clause, corresponding, to, an, english, clause, with, which, or, who, as, in, the, following, example, lu, man, e, house, i, n, u, a, fin, 3, a, build, nmlz, lu, e, i, n, u, a, man, house, fin, 3, a, build, nmlz, the, man, who, built, the, house, like, the, participles, the, relative, clauses, can, describe, any, participant, involved, in, the, action, or, state, expressed, by, the, verb, and, the, specific, participant, is, determined, by, context, e, g, mu, nna, n, um, a, can, be, which, he, gave, to, him, who, gave, something, to, him, etc, the, nominalized, clause, can, also, be, a, complement, clause, corresponding, to, an, english, clause, with, that, e, g, e, 2, in, u, 2, a, in, zu, he, knows, that, he, built, the, house, like, a, noun, it, can, be, followed, by, case, morphemes, the, nominalized, clause, can, directly, modify, a, noun, expressing, time, such, as, ud, day, time, mu, year, and, itid, month, and, this, in, turn, can, then, stand, in, the, locative, and, ablative, in, the, same, meanings, as, the, clauses, themselves, ud, e, 2, in, u, 2, a, a, ta, when, after, he, built, the, house, in, this, case, the, particle, bi, sometimes, precedes, the, case, morpheme, ud, e, 2, in, u, 2, a, b, a, the, basic, meaning, is, still, of, when, the, nominalized, clause, can, also, be, included, in, the, various, prepositional, constructions, mentioned, above, the, structure, is, shown, more, clearly, in, the, following, example, egir, back, amaru, flood, ba, ur, a, ak, ta, mid, sweep, over, nmlz, gen, abl, egir, amaru, ba, ur, a, ak, ta, back, flood, mid, sweep, over, nmlz, gen, abl, after, the, flood, had, swept, over, several, clauses, can, be, nominalized, by, a, single, a, enclitic, ka, a, ba, za, engar, e, nu, i, b, dab, a, b, i, n, dug, he, said, that, the, fox, had, escaped, and, the, farmer, had, not, caught, it, participles, can, function, in, a, very, similar, way, to, the, nominalized, clauses, and, be, combined, with, the, same, kinds, of, adjuncts, one, peculiarity, is, that, unlike, nominalized, clauses, they, may, also, express, the, agent, as, a, possessor, in, the, genitive, case, e, 2, u, 2, a, lugal, la, the, house, built, by, the, king, however, when, the, head, noun, e, 2, is, specified, as, here, a, more, common, construction, uses, the, ergative, e, 2, lugal, e, u, 2, a, a, special, subordinating, construction, with, the, temporal, meaning, of, an, english, when, clause, is, the, so, called, pronominal, conjugation, which, contains, a, verb, nominalized, with, a, and, following, possessive, pronominal, markers, referring, to, the, subject, transitive, or, intransitive, in, the, 3rd, person, the, form, appears, to, end, in, the, possessive, pronominal, marker, alone, kur, 9, r, a, ni, when, he, entered, lit, his, entering, etc, it, has, been, suggested, that, these, forms, actually, also, contain, a, final, directive, marker, e, in, this, example, the, analysis, would, be, kur, a, ni, e, at, his, entering, similarly, in, old, babylonian, sumerian, one, sometimes, finds, the, locative, or, ablative, markers, after, the, possessive, kur, 9, ra, n, a, kur, 9, ra, ni, ta, in, contrast, in, the, 1st, and, 2nd, persons, the, 1st, and, 2nd, person, pronouns, are, followed, by, the, syllable, ne, zig, 3, ga, g, u, 10, ne, as, i, rose, the, verb, itself, may, be, in, am, u, as, in, the, above, examples, or, in, mar, followed, by, the, modal, imperfective, suffix, ed, zi, zi, d, a, g, u, 10, ne, when, i, rise, the, same, construction, is, used,
