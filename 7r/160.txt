the, gregorian, calendar, the, most, widely, used, calendar, system, today, new, year, occurs, on, january, 1, new, year, s, day, preceded, by, new, year, s, eve, this, was, also, the, first, day, of, the, year, in, the, original, julian, calendar, and, the, roman, calendar, after, 153, bc, other, cultures, observe, their, traditional, or, religious, new, year, s, day, according, to, their, own, customs, typically, though, not, invariably, because, they, use, a, lunar, calendar, or, a, lunisolar, calendar, chinese, new, year, the, islamic, new, year, tamil, new, year, puthandu, and, the, jewish, new, year, are, among, well, known, examples, india, nepal, and, other, countries, also, celebrate, new, year, on, dates, according, to, their, own, calendars, that, are, movable, in, the, gregorian, calendar, during, the, middle, ages, in, western, europe, while, the, julian, calendar, was, still, in, use, authorities, moved, new, year, s, day, depending, upon, locale, to, one, of, several, other, days, including, march, 1, march, 25, easter, september, 1, and, december, 25, since, then, many, national, civil, calendars, in, the, western, world, and, beyond, have, changed, to, using, one, fixed, date, for, new, year, s, day, january, 1, most, doing, so, when, they, adopted, the, gregorian, calendar, based, on, the, used, calendar, new, years, are, often, categorized, between, lunar, or, lunisolar, new, years, or, solar, new, years, the, new, year, of, many, south, and, southeast, asian, calendars, falls, between, april, 13, 15, marking, the, beginning, of, spring, the, early, development, of, the, christian, liturgical, year, coincided, with, the, roman, empire, east, and, west, and, later, the, byzantine, empire, both, of, which, employed, a, taxation, system, labeled, the, indiction, the, years, for, which, began, on, september, 1, this, timing, may, account, for, the, ancient, church, s, establishment, of, september, 1, as, the, beginning, of, the, liturgical, year, despite, the, official, roman, new, year, s, day, of, january, 1, in, the, julian, calendar, because, the, indiction, was, the, principal, means, for, counting, years, in, the, empires, apart, from, the, reigns, of, the, emperors, the, september, 1, date, prevailed, throughout, all, of, christendom, for, many, centuries, until, subsequent, divisions, eventually, produced, revisions, in, some, places, after, the, sack, of, rome, in, 410, communications, and, travel, between, east, and, west, deteriorated, liturgical, developments, in, rome, and, constantinople, did, not, always, match, although, a, rigid, adherence, to, form, was, never, mandated, in, the, church, nevertheless, the, principal, points, of, development, were, maintained, between, east, and, west, the, roman, and, constantinopolitan, liturgical, calendars, remained, compatible, even, after, the, east, west, schism, in, 1054, separations, between, the, catholic, general, roman, calendar, and, eastern, orthodox, liturgical, calendar, grew, only, over, several, centuries, time, during, those, intervening, centuries, the, latin, church, catholic, ecclesiastic, year, was, moved, to, the, first, day, of, advent, the, sunday, nearest, to, st, andrew, s, day, november, 30, by, the, time, of, the, reformation, early, 16th, century, the, roman, catholic, general, calendar, provided, the, initial, basis, for, the, calendars, for, the, liturgically, oriented, protestants, including, the, anglican, and, lutheran, churches, who, inherited, this, observation, of, the, liturgical, new, year, the, present, day, eastern, orthodox, liturgical, calendar, is, the, virtual, culmination, of, the, ancient, eastern, development, cycle, though, it, includes, later, additions, based, on, subsequent, history, and, lives, of, saints, it, still, begins, on, september, 1, proceeding, annually, into, the, nativity, of, the, theotokos, september, 8, and, exaltation, of, the, cross, september, 14, to, the, celebration, of, nativity, of, christ, christmas, through, his, death, and, resurrection, pascha, easter, to, his, ascension, and, the, dormition, of, the, theotokos, falling, asleep, of, the, virgin, mary, august, 15, this, last, feast, is, known, in, the, roman, catholic, church, as, the, assumption, the, dating, of, september, 1, is, according, to, the, new, revised, julian, calendar, or, the, old, standard, julian, calendar, depending, on, which, is, used, by, a, particular, orthodox, church, hence, it, may, fall, on, september, 1, on, the, civil, calendar, or, on, september, 14, between, 1900, and, 2099, inclusive, the, liturgical, calendars, of, the, coptic, and, ethiopian, orthodox, churches, are, unrelated, to, these, systems, but, instead, follow, the, alexandrian, calendar, which, fixed, the, wandering, ancient, egyptian, calendar, to, the, julian, year, their, new, year, celebrations, on, neyrouz, and, enkutatash, were, fixed, however, at, a, point, in, the, sothic, cycle, close, to, the, indiction, between, the, years, 1900, and, 2100, they, fall, on, september, 11, during, most, years, and, september, 12, in, the, years, preceding, a, leap, year, during, the, roman, republic, and, the, roman, empire, years, began, on, the, date, on, which, each, consul, first, entered, the, office, this, was, probably, may, 1, before, 222, bc, march, 15, from, 222, bc, to, 154, bc, and, january, 1, from, 153, bc, in, 45, bc, when, julius, caesar, s, new, julian, calendar, took, effect, the, senate, fixed, january, 1, as, the, first, day, of, the, year, at, that, time, this, was, the, date, on, which, those, who, were, to, hold, civil, office, assumed, their, official, position, and, it, was, also, the, traditional, annual, date, for, the, convening, of, the, roman, senate, this, civil, new, year, remained, in, effect, throughout, the, roman, empire, east, and, west, during, its, lifetime, and, well, after, wherever, the, julian, calendar, continued, in, use, in, the, middle, ages, in, europe, a, number, of, significant, feast, days, in, the, ecclesiastical, calendar, of, the, roman, catholic, church, came, to, be, used, as, the, beginning, of, the, julian, year, over, the, centuries, countries, changed, between, styles, until, the, modern, style, january, 1, prevailed, for, example, a, more, unusual, case, is, france, which, observed, the, northern, autumn, equinox, day, usually, september, 22, as, new, year, s, day, in, the, french, republican, calendar, which, was, in, use, from, 1793, to, 1805, this, was, primidi, vend, miaire, the, first, day, of, the, first, month, it, took, quite, a, long, time, before, january, 1, again, became, the, universal, or, standard, start, of, the, civil, year, the, years, of, adoption, of, january, 1, as, the, new, year, are, as, follows, march, 1, was, the, first, day, of, the, numbered, year, in, the, republic, of, venice, until, its, destruction, in, 1797, and, in, russia, from, 988, until, 1492, anno, mundi, 7000, in, the, byzantine, calendar, september, 1, was, used, in, russia, from, 1492, a, m, 7000, until, the, adoption, of, both, the, anno, domini, notation, and, 1, january, as, new, year, s, day, with, effect, from, 1700, via, december, 1699, decrees, 1735, 1736, of, tsar, peter, i, because, of, the, division, of, the, globe, into, time, zones, the, new, year, moves, progressively, around, the, globe, as, the, start, of, the, day, ushers, in, the, new, year, the, first, time, zone, to, usher, in, the, new, year, just, west, of, the, international, date, line, is, located, in, the, line, islands, a, part, of, the, nation, of, kiribati, and, has, a, time, zone, 14, hours, ahead, of, utc, all, other, time, zones, are, 1, to, 25, hours, behind, most, in, the, previous, day, december, 31, on, american, samoa, and, midway, it, is, still, 11, pm, on, december, 30, these, are, among, the, last, inhabited, places, to, observe, new, year, however, uninhabited, outlying, us, territories, howland, island, and, baker, island, are, designated, as, lying, within, the, time, zone, 12, hours, behind, utc, the, last, places, on, earth, to, see, the, arrival, of, january, 1, these, small, coral, islands, are, found, about, midway, between, hawaii, and, australia, about, 1, 000, miles, west, of, the, line, islands, this, is, because, the, international, date, line, is, a, composite, of, local, time, zone, arrangements, which, winds, through, the, pacific, ocean, allowing, each, locale, to, remain, most, closely, connected, in, time, with, the, nearest, or, largest, or, most, convenient, political, and, economic, locales, with, which, each, associate, by, the, time, howland, island, sees, the, new, year, it, is, 2, am, on, january, 2, in, the, line, islands, of, kiribati
