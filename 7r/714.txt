known, as, ragging, in, certain, countries, especially, those, of, the, indian, subcontinent, the, main, platform, for, bullying, in, contemporary, culture, is, on, social, media, websites, in, a, 2012, study, of, male, adolescent, american, football, players, the, strongest, predictor, was, the, perception, of, whether, the, most, influential, male, in, a, player, s, life, would, approve, of, the, bullying, behavior, a, study, by, the, lancet, child, adolescent, health, in, 2019, showed, a, relationship, between, social, media, use, by, girls, and, an, increase, in, their, exposure, to, bullying, bullying, may, be, defined, in, many, different, ways, in, the, united, kingdom, there, is, no, legal, definition, of, bullying, while, some, states, in, the, united, states, have, laws, against, it, bullying, is, divided, into, four, basic, types, of, abuse, psychological, sometimes, called, emotional, or, relational, verbal, physical, and, cyber, though, an, encounter, can, fall, into, multiple, of, these, categories, behaviors, used, to, assert, such, domination, may, include, physical, assault, or, coercion, verbal, harassment, or, threat, and, such, acts, may, be, directed, repeatedly, toward, particular, targets, rationalizations, of, such, behavior, sometimes, include, differences, of, social, class, race, religion, gender, sexual, orientation, appearance, behavior,

century, through, fine, fellow, blusterer, to, harasser, of, the, weak, this, may, have, been, as, a, connecting, sense, between, lover, and, ruffian, as, in, protector, of, a, prostitute, which, was, one, sense, of, bully, though, not, specifically, attested, until, 1706, the, verb, to, bully, is, first, attested, in, 1710, in, the, past, in, the, american, culture, the, term, has, been, used, as, an, exclamation, and, exhortation, especially, known, famously, in, association, with, theodore, roosevelt, in, 1907, roosevelt, coined, the, phrase, as, a, deprecating, term, bully, for, him,

bully, has, been, significantly, modified, through, the, years, and, through, language, translations, it, has, shifted, from, terms, of, endearment, to, a, form, of, sarcastic, jesting, and, then, to, an, action, against, others, and, something, to, be, fearful, of, bullying, has, been, classified, by, the, body, of, literature, into, different, types, these, can, be, in, the, form, of, nonverbal, verbal, or, physical, behavior, another, classification, is, based, on, perpetrators, or, the, participants, involved, so, that, the, types, include, individual, and, collective, bullying, other, interpretation, also, cite, emotional, and, relational, bullying, in, addition, to, physical, harm, inflicted, towards, another, person, or, even, property, this, is, present, in, extreme, forms, of, bullying, such, as, hate, crimes, a, hate, crime, is, when, a, perpetrator, harms, a, victim, because, they, perceive, them, to, be, a, member, of, an, outgroup, that, they, are, biased, against,

orientation, and, or, disability, both, bullying, and, hate, crimes, involve, the, devaluing, and, disrespecting, of, another, person, for, what, is, deemed, by, the, perpetrator, to, be, justified, reasons, yet, not, all, bullying, is, considered, to, be, a, hate, crime, bullies, often, select, their, victims, because, of, specific, characteristics, that, the, bully, views, as, nonconforming, to, their, sense, of, belonging, this, means, that, individuals, in, minority, groups, are, more, likely, to, be, targeted, however, bullies, choose, victims, that, are, more, available, and, or, vulnerable, this, is, a, more, broad, approach, than, in, hate, crimes, there, are, also, the, cases, being, researched, now, and, in, the, more, recent, years, of, the, phenomenon, called, cyberbullying, which, takes, place, in, the, virtual, world, physical, verbal, and, relational, bullying, are, most, prevalent, in, primary, school, and, could, also, begin, much, earlier, while,

physical, violence, in, physical, bullying, the, main, weapon, the, bully, uses, is, their, body, or, some, part, thereof, or, an, object, as, a, weapon, when, attacking, their, victim, sometimes, groups, of, young, adults, will, target, and, alienate, a, peer, because, of, some, adolescent, prejudice, this, can, quickly, lead, to, a, situation, where, they, are, being, taunted, tortured, and, beaten, up, by, their, classmates, physical, bullying, will, often, escalate, over, time, and, can, lead, to, a, detrimental, or, fatal, ending, and, therefore, many, try, to, stop, it, quickly, to, prevent, any, further, escalation, verbal, bullying, is, one, of, the, most, common, types, of, bullying, this, is, any, bullying, that, is, conducted, by, speaking, other, use, of, the, voice, or,

try, to, impress, someone, they, idolize, many, boys, are, subtle, enough, to, use, verbal, techniques, for, domination, when, they, want, to, avoid, the, trouble, that, can, come, with, physically, bullying, someone, else, relational, bullying, sometimes, referred, to, as, social, aggression, is, the, type, of, bullying, that, uses, relationships, to, hurt, others, the, term, also, denotes, any, bullying, that, is, done, with, the, intent, to, hurt, somebody, s, reputation, or, social, standing, which, can, also, link, in, with, the, techniques, included, in, physical, and, verbal, bullying, relational, bullying, is, a, form, of, bullying, common, among, youth, but, particularly, upon, girls, social, exclusion, slighting, or, making, someone, feel, left, out, is, one, of, the, most, common, types, of, relational, bullying, relational, bullying, can, be, used, as, a, tool, by, bullies, to, both, improve, their, social, standing, and, control, others, unlike, physical, bullying,

less, restrictive, through, the, use, of, the, internet, the, online, disinhibition, effect, the, use, of, technology, for, bullying, can, be, detrimental, to, someones, online, reputation, the, information, put, out, online, will, stay, there, forever, unless, taken, down, by, the, person, who, put, it, out, there, or, by, the, platform, and, sometimes, not, even, then, future, employers, and, people, with, access, to, the, internet, will, be, able, to, see, others, digital, footprint, and, how, you, treated, others, another, problem, with, cyberbullying, is, that, other, people, can,

the, bullying, of, an, individual, by, a, group, in, any, context, such, as, a, family, peer, group, school, workplace, neighborhood, community, or, online, when, it, occurs, as, emotional, abuse, in, the, workplace, such, as, ganging, up, by, co, workers, subordinates, or, superiors, to, force, someone, out, of, the, workplace, through, rumor, innuendo, intimidation, humiliation, discrediting, and, isolation, it, is, also, referred, to, as, malicious, nonsexual, nonracial, racial, general, harassment, studies, have, shown, that, envy, and, resentment, may, be, motives, for, bullying, research, on, the, self, esteem, of, bullies, has, produced, equivocal, results, while, some, bullies, are, arrogant, and, narcissistic, they, can, also, use, bullying, as, a, tool, to, conceal, shame, or, anxiety, or, to, boost, self, esteem, by, demeaning, others, the, abuser, feels, empowered, bullies, may, bully, out, of, jealousy, or, because, they, themselves, are, bullied, psychologist, roy, baumeister, asserts, that, people, who, are, prone, to, abusive, behavior, tend, to, have, inflated, but, fragile, egos, because, they, think, too, highly, of, themselves, they, are, frequently, offended, by, the, criticisms, and, lack, of, deference, of, other, people, and, react, to, this, disrespect, with, violence, and, insults, researchers, have, identified, other, risk, factors, such, as, depression, and, personality, disorders, as, well, as, quickness, to, anger, and, use, of, force, addiction, to, aggressive, behaviors, mistaking, others, actions, as, hostile, concern, with, preserving, self, image, and, engaging, in, obsessive, or, rigid, actions, a, combination, of, these, factors, may, also, be, causes, of, this, behavior, in, one, study, of, youth, a, combination, of, antisocial, traits, and, depression, was, found, to, be, the, best, predictor, of, youth, violence, whereas, video, game, violence, and, television, violence, exposure, were, not, predictive, of, these, behaviors, bullying, may, also, result, from, a, genetic, predisposition, or, a, brain, abnormality, in, the, bully, while, parents, can, help, a, toddler, develop, emotional, regulation, and, control, to, restrict, aggressive, behavior, some, children, fail, to, develop, these, skills, due, to, insecure, attachment, with, their, families, ineffective, discipline, and, environmental, factors, such, as, a, stressful, home, life, and, hostile, siblings, moreover, according, to, some, researchers, bullies, may, be, inclined, toward, negativity, and, perform, poorly, academically, dr, cook, says, a, typical, bully, has, trouble, resolving, problems, with, others, and, also, has, trouble, academically, he, or, she, usually, has, negative, attitudes, and, beliefs, about, others, feels, negatively, toward, himself, herself, comes, from, a, family, environment, characterized, by, conflict, and, poor, parenting, perceives, school, as, negative, and, is, negatively, influenced, by, peers, contrarily, some, researchers, have, suggested, that, some, bullies, are, psychologically, strongest, and, have, high, social, standing, among, their, peers, while, their, targets, are, emotionally, distressed, and, socially, marginalized, peer, groups, often, promote, the, bully, s, actions, and, members, of, these, peer, groups, also, engage, in, behaviors, such, as, mocking, excluding, punching, and, insulting, one, another, as, a, source, of, entertainment, other, researchers, also, argued, that, a, minority, of, the, bullies, those, who, are, not, in, turn, bullied, enjoy, going, to, school, and, are, least, likely, to, take, days, off, sick, research, indicates, that, adults, who, bully, have, authoritarian, personalities, combined, with, a, strong, need, to, control, or, dominate, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, a, prejudicial, view, of, subordinates, can, be, a, particularly, strong, risk, factor, in, a, recent, study, bullies, showed, lower, school, performance, related, self, esteem, than, non, involved, students, they, also, showed, higher, social, self, esteem, than, victims, of, traditional, bullying, brain, studies, have, shown, that, the, section, of, the, brain, associated, with, reward, becomes, active, when, bullies, are, shown, a, video, of, someone, inflicting, pain, on, another, often, bullying, takes, place, in, the, presence, of, a, large, group, of, relatively, uninvolved, bystanders, in, many, cases, it, is, the, bully, s, ability, to, create, the, illusion, they, have, the, support, of, the, majority, present, that, instills, the, fear, of, speaking, out, in, protestation, of, the, bullying, activities, being, observed, by, the, group, unless, the, bully, mentality, is, effectively, challenged, in, any, given, group, in, its, early, stages, it, often, becomes, an, accepted, or, supported, norm, within, the, group, unless, action, is, taken, a, culture, of, bullying, is, often, perpetuated, within, a, group, for, months, years, or, longer, bystanders, who, have, been, able, to, establish, their, own, friendship, group, or, support, group, have, been, found, to, be, far, more, likely, to, opt, to, speak, out, against, bullying, behavior, than, those, who, have, not, in, addition, to, communication, of, clear, expectations, that, bystanders, should, intervene, and, increasing, individual, self, efficacy, there, is, growing, research, to, suggest, interventions, should, build, on, the, foundation, that, bullying, is, morally, wrong, among, adults, being, a, bystander, to, workplace, bullying, was, linked, to, depression, the, bystander, effect, can, be, detrimental, to, the, person, being, bullied, people, are, less, likely, to, stand, up, for, someone, or, something, when, others, are, around, in, the, case, of, cyberbullying, people, that, see, bullying, happen, on, social, media, are, less, likely, to, say, something, back, whether, online, or, in, person, people, can, have, good, intentions, and, want, to, help, but, with, no, action, nothing, will, be, accomplished, the, act, of, others, stepping, in, is, what, will, stop, bullying, to, stop, the, bystander, effect, people, should, be, confident, and, stand, up, for, what, they, believe, in, do, not, worry, what, people, think, of, you, rather, think, of, what, the, benefits, can, be, for, the, person, being, bullied, dr, cook, says, a, typical, victim, is, likely, to, be, aggressive, lack, social, skills, think, negative, thoughts, experience, difficulties, in, solving, social, problems, come, from, a, negative, family, school, and, community, environments, and, be, noticeably, rejected, and, isolated, by, peers, victims, often, have, characteristics, such, as, being, physically, and, mentally, weak, as, well, as, being, easily, distraught, emotionally, they, may, also, have, physical, characteristics, that, make, them, easier, targets, for, bullies, such, as, being, overweight, or, having, some, type, of, physical, deformity, boys, are, more, likely, to, be, victims, of, physical, bullying, while, girls, are, more, likely, to, be, bullied, indirectly, low, levels, of, self, esteem, has, been, identified, as, a, frequent, antecedent, of, bullying, victimization, victims, of, traditional, bullying, tend, to, have, lower, global, social, body, related, and, emotional, self, esteem, compared, to, uninvolved, students, victims, of, cyberbullying, on, the, other, hand, may, not, have, lower, self, esteem, scores, than, uninvolved, students, but, might, have, higher, body, related, self, esteem, than, both, victims, of, traditional, bullying, and, bullies, it, has, also, been, shown, that, victims, are, more, likely, to, employ, self, defeating, or, self, deprecating, humor, intended, to, entertain, others, at, the, expense, of, themselves, and, their, own, feelings, the, results, of, a, meta, analysis, conducted, by, cook, and, published, by, the, american, psychological, association, in, 2010, concluded, the, main, risk, factors, for, children, and, adolescents, being, bullied, and, also, for, becoming, bullies, are, the, lack, of, social, problem, solving, skills, children, who, are, bullied, often, show, physical, or, emotional, signs, such, as, being, afraid, to, attend, school, complaining, of, headaches, or, a, loss, of, appetite, a, lack, of, interest, in, school, activities, or, in, spending, time, with, friends, or, family, reluctance, to, go, out, in, public, for, fear, they, may, encounter, their, bullies, in, public, places, other, than, school, and, having, an, overall, sense, of, sadness, mona, o, moore, of, the, anti, bullying, centre, at, trinity, college, in, dublin, has, written, there, is, a, growing, body, of, research, which, indicates, that, individuals, whether, child, or, adult, who, are, persistently, subjected, to, abusive, behavior, are, at, risk, of, stress, related, illness, which, can, sometimes, lead, to, suicide, those, who, have, been, the, targets, of, bullying, can, develop, long, term, emotional, and, behavioral, problems, bullying, can, cause, loneliness, depression, anxiety, lead, to, low, self, esteem, and, increased, susceptibility, to, illness, bullying, has, also, been, shown, to, cause, maladjustment, in, young, children, and, targets, of, bullying, who, were, also, bullies, themselves, exhibit, even, greater, social, difficulties, a, mental, health, report, also, found, that, bullying, was, linked, to, eating, disorders, anxiety, body, dysmorphia, and, other, negative, psychological, effects, both, victims, and, perpetrators, have, been, shown, to, exhibit, higher, levels, of, loneliness, even, though, there, is, evidence, that, bullying, increases, the, risk, of, suicide, bullying, alone, does, not, cause, suicide, depression, is, one, of, the, main, reasons, why, kids, who, are, bullied, die, by, suicide, it, is, estimated, that, between, 15, and, 25, children, die, by, suicide, every, year, in, the, uk, alone, because, they, are, being, bullied, certain, groups, seem, to, incur, a, higher, risk, for, suicide, such, as, native, americans, alaskan, natives, asian, americans, and, lgbt, people, when, someone, feels, unsupported, by, family, or, friends, it, can, make, the, situation, much, worse, for, the, victim, in, a, self, report, study, completed, in, new, york, by, 9th, through, 12th, graders, victims, of, bullying, reported, more, depressive, symptoms, and, psychological, distress, than, those, who, did, not, experience, bullying, all, types, of, involvement, in, bullying, among, both, boys, and, girls, is, associated, with, depression, even, a, couple, years, later, another, study, that, followed, up, with, finnish, teens, two, years, after, the, initial, survey, showed, that, depression, and, suicidal, ideation, is, higher, with, teens, who, are, bullied, than, those, who, did, not, report, experiencing, bullying, a, dutch, longitudinal, study, on, elementary, students, reported, that, boys, who, are, bully, victims, who, play, both, roles, of, a, victim, and, a, bully, were, more, likely, to, experience, depression, or, serious, suicidal, ideation, than, the, other, roles, victims, or, bullies, only, while, girls, who, have, any, involvement, in, bullying, have, a, higher, level, of, risk, for, depression, in, a, study, of, high, school, students, completed, in, boston, students, who, self, reported, being, victims, of, bullying, were, more, likely, to, consider, suicide, when, compared, to, youth, who, did, not, report, being, bullied, the, same, study, also, showed, a, higher, risk, of, suicidal, consideration, in, youth, who, report, being, a, perpetrator, victim, or, victim, perpetrator, victims, and, victim, bullies, are, associated, with, a, higher, risk, of, suicide, attempts, the, place, where, youth, live, also, appears, to, differentiate, their, bullying, experiences, such, that, those, living, in, more, urban, areas, who, reported, both, being, bullied, and, bullying, others, appear, to, show, higher, risk, of, suicidal, ideation, and, suicide, attempts, a, national, survey, given, to, american, 6th, through, 10th, grade, students, found, that, cyberbullying, victims, experience, a, higher, level, of, depression, than, victims, experiencing, other, forms, of, bullying, this, can, be, related, to, the, anonymity, behind, social, media, if, a, teen, is, being, bullied, and, is, displaying, symptoms, of, depression, it, should, be, questioned, and, interventions, should, be, implemented, the, danish, study, showed, that, kids, who, are, bullied, talked, to, their, parents, and, teachers, about, it, and, some, reported, a, decrease, in, bullying, or, a, stop, in, the, bullying, after, a, teacher, or, parent, intervened, the, study, emphasizes, the, importance, of, implementing, program, collaborations, in, schools, to, have, programs, and, anti, bullying, interventions, in, place, to, prevent, and, properly, intervene, when, it, occurs, the, study, also, shows, the, importance, of, having, parents, and, teachers, talk, to, the, bullies, about, their, bullying, behavior, in, order, to, provide, the, necessary, support, for, those, experiencing, bullying, while, some, people, find, it, very, easy, to, ignore, a, bully, others, may, find, it, very, difficult, and, reach, a, breaking, point, there, have, been, cases, of, apparent, bullying, suicides, that, have, been, reported, closely, by, the, media, these, include, the, deaths, of, ryan, halligan, phoebe, prince, dawn, marie, wesley, nicola, ann, raphael, megan, meier, audrie, pott, tyler, clementi, jamey, rodemeyer, kenneth, weishuhn, jadin, bell, kelly, yeomans, rehtaeh, parsons, amanda, todd, brodie, panlock, jessica, haffer, hamed, nastoh, sladjana, vidovic, april, himes, cherice, moralez, and, rebecca, ann, sedwick, according, to, the, suicide, awareness, voices, for, education, suicide, is, one, of, the, leading, causes, of, death, for, youth, from, 15, to, 24, years, old, over, 16, percent, of, students, seriously, consider, suicide, 13, percent, create, a, plan, and, 8, percent, have, made, a, serious, attempt, some, have, argued, that, bullying, can, teach, life, lessons, and, instill, strength, helene, guldberg, a, child, development, academic, sparked, controversy, when, she, argued, that, being, a, target, of, bullying, can, teach, a, child, how, to, manage, disputes, and, boost, their, ability, to, interact, with, others, and, that, teachers, should, not, intervene, but, leave, children, to, respond, to, the, bullying, themselves, others, however, have, pointed, out, that, this, is, only, true, for, normal, peer, conflicts, but, not, for, bullying, cases, the, teaching, of, anti, bullying, coping, skills, to, children, carers, and, teachers, has, been, found, to, be, an, effective, long, term, means, of, reducing, bullying, incidence, rates, and, a, valuable, skill, set, for, individuals, statistically, controlling, for, age, and, pubertal, status, results, indicated, that, on, average, verbally, bullied, girls, produced, less, testosterone, and, verbally, bullied, boys, produced, more, testosterone, than, their, nonbullied, counterparts, research, on, the, dark, triad, narcissism, machiavellianism, and, psychopathy, indicate, a, correlation, with, bullying, as, part, of, evidence, of, the, aversive, nature, of, those, traits, studies, have, shown, that, bullying, behavior, is, positively, correlated, with, dark, triad, traits, out, of, the, three, traits, of, the, dark, triad, psychopathy, is, most, strongly, correlated, to, bullying, it, is, posited, that, this, is,

by, teachers, and, the, school, system, itself, there, is, an, inherent, power, differential, in, the, system, that, can, easily, predispose, to, subtle, or, covert, abuse, relational, aggression, or,

school, board, owes, to, its, students, thus, it, sets, a, precedent, of, a, school, board, being, found, liable, in, negligence, for, harm, caused, to, a, child, because, they, failed, to, protect, a, child, from, the, bullying, actions, of, other, students, there, has, been, only, one, other, similar, bullying, case, and, it, was, won, in, australia, in, 2013, oyston, v, st, patricks, college,
