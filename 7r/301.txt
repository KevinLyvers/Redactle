chinese, surnames, were, derived, matrilineally, although, by, the, time, of, the, shang, dynasty, 1600, to, 1046, bc, they, had, become, patrilineal, chinese, women, do, not, change, their, names, upon, marriage, in, china, surnames, have, been, the, norm, since, at, least, the, 2nd, century, bc, in, the, early, islamic, period, 640, 900, ad, and, the, arab, world, the, use, of, patronymics, is, well, attested, the, famous, scholar, rhazes, c, 865, 925, ad, is, referred, to, as, al, razi, lit, the, one, from, ray, due, to, his, origins, from, the, city, of, ray, iran, in, the, levant, surnames, were, in, use, as, early, as, the, high, middle, ages, and, it, was, common, for, people, to, derive, their, surname, from, a, distant, ancestor, and, historically, the, surname, would, be, often, preceded, with, ibn, or, son, of, arab, family, names, often, denote, either, one, s, tribe, profession, a, famous, ancestor, or, the, place, of, origin, but, they, were, not, universal, for, example, hunayn, ibn, ishaq, fl, 850, ad, was, known, by, the, nisbah, al, ibadi, a, federation, of, arab, christian, tribes, that, lived, in, mesopotamia, prior, to, the, advent, of, islam, in, ancient, greece, as, far, back, as, the, archaic, period, clan, names, and, patronymics, son, of, were, also, common, as, in, aristides, as, a, genitive, singular, form, meaning, son, of, lysimachus, for, example, alexander, the, great, was, known, as, heracleides, as, a, supposed, descendant, of, heracles, and, by, the, dynastic, name, karanos, caranus, which, referred, to, the, founder, of, the, dynasty, to, which, he, belonged, these, patronymics, are, already, attested, for, many, characters, in, the, works, of, homer, at, other, times, formal, identification, commonly, included, the, place, of, origin, over, the, course, of, the, roman, republic, and, the, later, empire, naming, conventions, went, through, multiple, changes, see, roman, naming, conventions, the, nomen, the, name, of, the, gens, tribe, inherited, patrilineally, is, thought, to, have, already, been, in, use, by, 650, bc, the, nomen, was, to, identify, group, kinship, while, the, praenomen, forename, plural, praenomina, was, used, to, distinguish, individuals, within, the, group, female, praenomina, were, less, common, as, women, had, reduced, public, influence, and, were, commonly, known, by, the, feminine, form, of, the, nomen, alone, later, with, the, gradual, influence, of, greek, and, christian, culture, throughout, the, empire, christian, religious, names, were, sometimes, put, in, front, of, traditional, cognomina, but, eventually, people, reverted, to, single, names, by, the, time, of, the, fall, of, the, western, roman, empire, in, the, 5th, century, family, names, were, uncommon, in, the, eastern, roman, empire, in, western, europe, where, germanic, culture, dominated, the, aristocracy, family, names, were, almost, non, existent, they, would, not, significantly, reappear, again, in, eastern, roman, society, until, the, 10th, century, apparently, influenced, by, the, familial, affiliations, of, the, armenian, military, aristocracy, the, practice, of, using, family, names, spread, through, the, eastern, roman, empire, however, it, was, not, until, the, 11th, century, that, surnames, came, to, be, used, in, west, europe, medieval, spain, used, a, patronymic, system, for, example, lvaro, a, son, of, rodrigo, would, be, named, lvaro, rodr, guez, his, son, juan, would, not, be, named, juan, rodr, guez, but, juan, lvarez, over, time, many, of, these, patronymics, became, family, names, and, they, are, some, of, the, most, common, names, in, the, spanish, speaking, world, today, other, sources, of, surnames, are, personal, appearance, or, habit, e, g, delgado, thin, and, moreno, dark, geographic, location, or, ethnicity, e, g, alem, n, german, and, occupations, e, g, molinero, miller, zapatero, shoe, maker, and, guerrero, warrior, although, occupational, names, are, much, more, often, found, in, a, shortened, form, referring, to, the, trade, itself, e, g, molina, mill, guerra, war, or, zapata, archaic, form, of, zapato, shoe, in, england, the, introduction, of, family, names, is, generally, attributed, to, the, preparation, of, the, domesday, book, in, 1086, following, the, norman, conquest, evidence, indicates, that, surnames, were, first, adopted, among, the, feudal, nobility, and, gentry, and, slowly, spread, to, other, parts, of, society, some, of, the, early, norman, nobility, who, arrived, in, england, during, the, norman, conquest, differentiated, themselves, by, affixing, de, of, before, the, name, of, their, village, in, france, this, is, what, is, known, as, a, territorial, surname, a, consequence, of, feudal, landownership, by, the, 14th, century, most, english, and, most, scottish, people, used, surnames, and, in, wales, following, unification, under, henry, viii, in, 1536, a, four, year, study, led, by, the, university, of, the, west, of, england, which, concluded, in, 2016, analysed, sources, dating, from, the, 11th, to, the, 19th, century, to, explain, the, origins, of, the, surnames, in, the, british, isles, the, study, found, that, over, 90, of, the, 45, 602, surnames, in, the, dictionary, are, native, to, britain, and, ireland, with, the, most, common, in, the, uk, being, smith, jones, williams, brown, taylor, davies, and, wilson, the, findings, have, been, published, in, the, oxford, english, dictionary, of, family, names, in, britain, and, ireland, with, project, leader, richard, coates, calling, the, study, more, detailed, and, accurate, than, those, before, he, elaborated, on, the, origins, some, surnames, have, origins, that, are, occupational, obvious, examples, are, smith, and, baker, other, names, can, be, linked, to, a, place, for, example, hill, or, green, which, relates, to, a, village, green, surnames, that, are, patronymic, are, those, which, originally, enshrined, the, father, s, name, such, as, jackson, or, jenkinson, there, are, also, names, where, the, origin, describes, the, original, bearer, such, as, brown, short, or, thin, though, short, may, in, fact, be, an, ironic, nickname, surname, for, a, tall, person, in, the, modern, era, governments, have, enacted, laws, to, require, people, to, adopt, surnames, this, served, the, purpose, of, uniquely, identifying, subjects, for, taxation, purposes, or, for, inheritance, in, the, late, middle, ages, in, europe, there, were, several, revolts, against, the, mandate, to, have, a, surname, during, the, modern, era, many, cultures, around, the, world, adopted, family, names, particularly, for, administrative, reasons, especially, during, the, age, of, european, expansion, and, particularly, since, 1600, the, napoleonic, code, adopted, in, various, parts, of, europe, stipulated, that, people, should, be, known, by, both, their, given, name, s, and, a, family, name, that, would, not, change, across, generations, other, notable, examples, include, the, netherlands, 1795, 1811, japan, 1870s, thailand, 1920, and, turkey, 1934, the, structure, of, the, japanese, name, was, formalized, by, the, government, as, family, name, given, name, in, 1868, in, breslau, prussia, enacted, the, hoym, ordinance, in, 1790, mandating, the, adoption, of, jewish, surnames, napoleon, also, insisted, on, jews, adopting, fixed, names, in, a, decree, issued, in, 1808, names, can, sometimes, be, changed, to, protect, individual, privacy, such, as, in, witness, protection, or, in, cases, where, groups, of, people, are, escaping, persecution, after, arriving, in, the, united, states, european, jews, who, fled, nazi, persecution, sometimes, anglicized, their, surnames, to, avoid, discrimination, governments, can, also, forcibly, change, people, s, names, as, when, the, national, socialist, government, of, germany, assigned, german, names, to, european, people, in, the, territories, they, conquered, in, the, 1980s, the, people, s, republic, of, bulgaria, forcibly, changed, the, first, and, last, names, of, its, turkish, citizens, to, bulgarian, names, these, are, the, oldest, and, most, common, type, of, surname, they, may, be, a, first, name, such, as, wilhelm, a, patronymic, such, as, andersen, a, matronymic, such, as, beaton, or, a, clan, name, such, as, o, brien, multiple, surnames, may, be, derived, from, a, single, given, name, e, g, there, are, thought, to, be, over, 90, italian, surnames, based, on, the, given, name, giovanni, this, is, the, broadest, class, of, surnames, originating, from, nicknames, encompassing, many, types, of, origin, these, include, names, based, on, appearance, such, as, schwartzkopf, short, and, possibly, caesar, and, names, based, on, temperament, and, personality, such, as, daft, gutman, and, maiden, which, according, to, a, number, of, sources, was, an, english, nickname, meaning, effeminate, a, group, of, nicknames, look, like, occupational, ones, king, bishop, abbot, sheriff, knight, etc, but, it, is, rather, unlikely, that, a, person, with, surname, king, was, a, king, or, descended, from, a, king, bernard, deacon, suggests, that, the, first, nickname, surname, bearer, may, have, acted, as, a, king, or, bishop, or, was, corpulent, as, bishop, etc, a, considerable, group, of, surname, producing, nicknames, may, be, found, among, ethnonymic, surnames, ornamental, surnames, are, made, up, of, names, not, specific, to, any, attribute, place, parentage, occupation, caste, of, the, first, person, to, acquire, the, name, and, stem, from, the, middle, class, s, desire, for, their, own, hereditary, names, like, the, nobles, they, were, generally, acquired, later, in, history, and, generally, when, those, without, surnames, needed, them, in, 1526, king, frederik, i, of, denmark, norway, ordered, that, noble, families, must, take, up, fixed, surnames, and, many, of, them, took, as, their, name, some, element, of, their, coat, of, arms, for, example, the, rosenkrantz, rose, wreath, family, took, their, surname, from, a, wreath, of, roses, comprising, the, torse, of, their, arms, and, the, gyldenstierne, golden, star, family, took, theirs, from, a, 7, pointed, gold, star, on, their, shield, subsequently, many, middle, class, scandinavian, families, desired, names, similar, to, those, of, the, nobles, and, adopted, ornamental, surnames, as, well, most, other, naming, traditions, refer, to, them, as, acquired, they, might, be, given, to, people, newly, immigrated, conquered, or, converted, as, well, as, those, with, unknown, parentage, formerly, enslaved, or, from, parentage, without, a, surname, tradition, ornamental, surnames, are, more, common, in, communities, that, adopted, or, were, forced, to, adopt, surnames, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, they, occur, commonly, in, scandinavia, and, among, sinti, and, roma, and, jews, in, germany, and, austria, during, the, era, of, the, trans, atlantic, slave, trade, many, africans, were, given, new, names, by, their, masters, many, of, the, family, names, of, many, african, americans, have, their, origins, in, slavery, i, e, slave, name, some, freed, slaves, later, created, family, names, themselves, another, category, of, acquired, names, is, foundlings, names, historically, children, born, to, unwed, parents, or, extremely, poor, parents, would, be, abandoned, in, a, public, place, or, anonymously, placed, in, a, foundling, wheel, such, abandoned, children, might, be, claimed, and, named, by, religious, figures, the, community, leaders, or, adoptive, parents, some, such, children, were, given, surnames, that, reflected, their, condition, like, italian, esposito, innocenti, della, casagrande, trovato, abbandonata, or, dutch, vondeling, verlaeten, bijstand, other, children, were, named, for, the, street, place, they, were, found, union, liquorpond, street, di, palermo, baan, bijdam, van, den, eyngel, shop, name, van, der, stoep, von, trapp, the, date, they, were, found, monday, septembre, spring, di, gennaio, or, festival, feast, day, they, found, or, christened, easter, sanjos, some, foundlings, were, given, the, name, of, whoever, found, them, occupational, names, include, smith, miller, farmer, thatcher, shepherd, potter, and, so, on, as, well, as, non, english, ones, such, as, the, german, eisenhauer, iron, hewer, later, anglicized, in, america, as, eisenhower, or, schneider, tailor, or, as, in, english, schmidt, smith, there, are, also, more, complicated, names, based, on, occupational, titles, in, england, it, was, common, for, servants, to, take, a, modified, version, of, their, employer, s, occupation, or, first, name, as, their, last, name, adding, the, letter, s, to, the, word, although, this, formation, could, also, be, a, patronymic, for, instance, the, surname, vickers, is, thought, to, have, arisen, as, an, occupational, name, adopted, by, the, servant, of, a, vicar, while, roberts, could, have, been, adopted, by, either, the, son, or, the, servant, of, a, man, named, robert, a, subset, of, occupational, names, in, english, are, names, thought, to, be, derived, from, the, medieval, mystery, plays, the, participants, would, often, play, the, same, roles, for, life, passing, the, part, down, to, their, oldest, sons, names, derived, from, this, may, include, king, lord, and, virgin, the, original, meaning, of, names, based, on, medieval, occupations, may, no, longer, be, obvious, in, modern, english, location, toponymic, habitation, names, derive, from, the, inhabited, location, associated, with, the, person, given, that, name, such, locations, can, be, any, type, of, settlement, such, as, homesteads, farms, enclosures, villages, hamlets, strongholds, or, cottages, one, element, of, a, habitation, name, may, describe, the, type, of, settlement, examples, of, old, english, elements, are, frequently, found, in, the, second, element, of, habitational, names, the, habitative, elements, in, such, names, can, differ, in, meaning, according, to, different, periods, different, locations, or, with, being, used, with, certain, other, elements, for, example, the, old, english, element, t, n, may, have, originally, meant, enclosure, in, one, name, but, can, have, meant, farmstead, village, manor, or, estate, in, other, names, location, names, or, habitation, names, may, be, as, generic, as, monte, portuguese, for, mountain, g, rski, polish, for, hill, or, pitt, variant, of, pit, but, may, also, refer, to, specific, locations, washington, for, instance, is, thought, to, mean, the, homestead, of, the, family, of, wassa, while, lucci, means, resident, of, lucca, although, some, surnames, such, as, london, lisboa, or, bia, ystok, are, derived, from, large, cities, more, people, reflect, the, names, of, smaller, communities, as, in, creachmhaoil, derived, from, a, village, in, county, galway, this, is, thought, to, be, due, to, the, tendency, in, europe, during, the, middle, ages, for, migration, to, chiefly, be, from, smaller, communities, to, the, cities, and, the, need, for, new, arrivals, to, choose, a, defining, surname, in, portuguese, speaking, countries, it, is, uncommon, but, not, unprecedented, to, find, surnames, derived, from, names, of, countries, such, as, portugal, fran, a, brasil, holanda, surnames, derived, from, country, names, are, also, found, in, english, such, as, england, wales, spain, many, japanese, surnames, derive, from, geographical, features, for, example, ishikawa, means, stone, river, and, is, also, the, name, of, one, of, japan, s, prefectures, yamamoto, means, the, base, of, the, mountain, and, inoue, means, above, the, well, arabic, names, sometimes, contain, surnames, that, denote, the, city, of, origin, for, example, in, cases, of, saddam, hussein, al, tikriti, meaning, saddam, hussein, originated, from, tikrit, a, city, in, iraq, this, component, of, the, name, is, called, a, nisbah, the, meanings, of, some, names, are, unknown, or, unclear, the, most, common, european, name, in, this, category, may, be, the, irish, name, ryan, which, means, little, king, in, irish, also, celtic, origin, of, the, name, arthur, meaning, bear, other, surnames, may, have, arisen, from, more, than, one, source, the, name, de, luca, for, instance, likely, arose, either, in, or, near, lucania, or, in, the, family, of, someone, named, lucas, or, lucius, in, some, instances, however, the, name, may, have, arisen, from, lucca, with, the, spelling, and, pronunciation, changing, over, time, and, with, emigration, the, same, name, may, appear, in, different, cultures, by, coincidence, or, romanization, the, surname, lee, is, used, in, english, culture, but, is, also, a, romanization, of, the, chinese, surname, li, in, the, russian, empire, illegitimate, children, were, sometimes, given, artificial, surnames, rather, than, the, surnames, of, their, adoptive, parents, in, many, cultures, particularly, in, european, and, european, influenced, cultures, in, the, americas, oceania, etc, as, well, as, west, asia, north, africa, south, asia, and, most, sub, saharan, african, cultures, the, surname, or, family, name, last, name, is, placed, after, the, personal, forename, in, europe, or, given, name, first, name, in, other, cultures, the, surname, is, placed, first, followed, by, the, given, name, or, names, the, latter, is, often, called, the, eastern, naming, order, because, europeans, are, most, familiar, with, the, examples, from, the, east, asian, cultural, sphere, specifically, greater, china, korea, both, north, and, south, japan, and, vietnam, this, is, also, the, case, in, cambodia, and, among, the, hmong, of, laos, and, thailand, the, telugu, people, of, south, india, also, place, surname, before, personal, name, there, are, some, parts, of, europe, in, particular, hungary, where, the, surname, is, placed, before, the, personal, name, since, family, names, are, normally, written, last, in, european, societies, the, terms, last, name, or, surname, are, commonly, used, for, the, family, name, while, in, japan, with, vertical, writing, the, family, name, may, be, referred, to, as, upper, name, ue, no, namae, when, people, from, areas, using, eastern, naming, order, write, their, personal, name, in, the, latin, alphabet, it, is, common, to, reverse, the, order, of, the, given, and, family, names, for, the, convenience, of, westerners, so, that, they, know, which, name, is, the, family, name, for, official, formal, purposes, reversing, the, order, of, names, for, the, same, reason, is, also, customary, for, the, baltic, finnic, peoples, and, the, hungarians, but, other, uralic, peoples, traditionally, did, not, have, surnames, perhaps, because, of, the, clan, structure, of, their, societies, the, samis, depending, on, the, circumstances, of, their, names, either, saw, no, change, or, did, see, a, transformation, of, their, name, for, example, sire, in, some, cases, became, siri, and, h, tta, j, hko, sslat, became, aslak, jacobsen, h, tta, as, was, the, norm, recently, integration, into, the, eu, and, increased, communications, with, foreigners, prompted, many, samis, to, reverse, the, order, of, their, full, name, to, given, name, followed, by, surname, to, avoid, their, given, name, being, mistaken, for, and, used, as, a, surname, indian, surnames, may, often, denote, village, profession, and, or, caste, and, are, invariably, mentioned, along, with, the, personal, first, names, however, hereditary, last, names, are, not, universal, in, telugu, speaking, families, in, south, india, surname, is, placed, before, personal, first, name, and, in, most, cases, it, is, only, shown, as, an, initial, for, example, s, for, suryapeth, in, english, and, other, languages, like, spanish, although, the, usual, order, of, names, is, first, middle, last, for, the, purpose, of, cataloging, in, libraries, and, in, citing, the, names, of, authors, in, scholarly, papers, the, order, is, changed, to, last, first, middle, with, the, last, and, first, names, separated, by, a, comma, and, items, are, alphabetized, by, the, last, name, in, france, italy, spain, belgium, and, latin, america, administrative, usage, is, to, put, the, surname, before, the, first, on, official, documents, in, most, balto, slavic, languages, such, as, latvian, lithuanian, bulgarian, macedonian, russian, polish, slovak, czech, etc, as, well, as, in, greek, irish, icelandic, and, azerbaijani, some, surnames, change, form, depending, on, the, gender, of, the, bearer, in, slavic, languages, substantivized, adjective, surnames, have, commonly, symmetrical, adjective, variants, for, males, and, females, podwi, ski, podwi, ska, in, polish, nov, nov, in, czech, or, slovak, etc, in, the, case, of, nominative, and, quasi, nominative, surnames, the, female, variant, is, derived, from, the, male, variant, by, a, possessive, suffix, nov, k, nov, kov, hromada, hromadov, in, czech, and, slovak, the, pure, possessive, would, be, nov, kova, hromadova, but, the, surname, evolved, to, a, more, adjectivized, form, nov, kov, hromadov, to, suppress, the, historical, possessivity, some, rare, types, of, surnames, are, universal, and, gender, neutral, examples, in, czech, are, jan, martin, fojt, kov, these, are, the, archaic, form, of, the, possessive, related, to, the, plural, name, of, the, family, such, rare, surnames, are, also, often, used, for, transgender, persons, during, transition, because, most, common, surnames, are, gender, specific, the, informal, dialectal, female, form, in, polish, and, czech, dialects, was, also, ka, pawlaczka, kube, ka, with, the, exception, of, the, ski, ska, suffix, most, feminine, forms, of, surnames, are, seldom, observed, in, polish, generally, inflected, languages, use, names, and, surnames, as, living, words, not, as, static, identifiers, thus, the, pair, or, the, family, can, be, named, by, a, plural, form, which, can, differ, from, the, singular, male, and, female, form, for, instance, when, the, male, form, is, nov, k, and, the, female, form, nov, kov, the, family, name, is, nov, kovi, in, czech, and, nov, kovci, in, slovak, when, the, male, form, is, hrub, and, the, female, form, is, hrub, the, plural, family, name, is, hrub, or, rodina, hrub, ch, in, greece, if, a, man, called, papadopoulos, has, a, daughter, she, will, likely, be, named, papadopoulou, if, the, couple, has, decided, their, offspring, will, take, his, surname, the, genitive, form, as, if, the, daughter, is, of, a, man, named, papadopoulos, likewise, the, surnames, of, daughters, of, males, with, surnames, ending, in, as, will, end, in, a, and, those, of, daughters, of, males, with, the, is, suffix, will, have, the, i, suffix, latvian, like, lithuanian, use, strictly, feminized, surnames, for, women, even, in, the, case, of, foreign, names, the, function, of, the, suffix, is, purely, grammar, male, surnames, ending, e, or, a, need, not, be, modified, for, women, an,

its, own, rules, as, to, how, the, names, are, formed, passed, and, used, however, the, style, of, having, both, a, family, name, surname, and, a, given, name, forename, is, far, from, universal, see, history, below, in, many, cultures, it, is, common, for, people, to, have, one, name, or, mononym, with, some, cultures, not, using, family, names, issues, of, family, name, arise, especially, on, the, passing, of, a, name, to, a, newborn, child, the, adoption, of, a, common, family, name, on, marriage, the, renunciation, of, a, family, name, and, the, changing, of, a, family, name, surname,

husband, s, surname, and, for, any, children, born, to, bear, the, father, s, surname, if, a, child, s, paternity, was, not, known, or, if, the, putative, father, denied, paternity, the, newborn, child, would, have, the, surname, of, the, mother, that, is, still, the, custom, or, law, in, many, countries, the, surname, for, children, of, married, parents, is, usually, inherited, from, the, father, in, recent, years, there, has, been, a, trend, towards, equality, of, treatment, in, relation, to, family, names, with, women, being, not, automatically, required, expected, or, in, some, places, even, forbidden, to, take, the, husband, s, surname, on, marriage, with, the, children, not, automatically, being, given, the, father, s, surname, in, this, article, both, family, name, and, surname, mean, the, patrilineal, surname, which, is, handed, down, from, or, inherited, from, the, father, unless, it, is, explicitly, stated, otherwise, thus, the, term, maternal, surname, means,

and, married, names, in, the, middle, ages, when, a, man, from, a, lower, status, family, married, an, only, daughter, from, a, higher, status, family, he, would, often, adopt, the, wife, s, family, name, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, in, britain, bequests, were, sometimes, made, contingent, upon, a, man, s, changing, or, hyphenating, his, family, name, so, that, the, name, of, the, testator, continued, the, united, states, followed, the, naming, customs, and, practices, of, english, common, law, and, traditions, until, recent, times, the, first, known, instance, in, the, united, states, of, a, woman, insisting, on, the, use, of, her, birth, name, was, that, of, lucy, stone, in, 1855, and, there, has, been, a, general, increase, in, the, rate, of, women, using, their, birth, name, beginning, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 20th, century, traditional, naming, practices, writes, one, commentator, were, recognized, as, com, into, conflict, with, current, sensitivities, about, children, s, and, women, s, rights, those, changes, accelerated, a, shift, away, from, the, interests, of, the, parents, to, a, focus, on, the, best, interests, of, the, child, the, law, in, this, area, continues, to, evolve, today, mainly, in, the, context, of, paternity, and, custody, actions, naming, conventions, in, the, us, have, gone, through, periods, of, flux, however, and, the, 1990s, saw, a, decline, in, the, percentage, of, name, retention, among, women, as, of, 2006, more, than, 80, of, american, women, adopted, the, husband, s, family, name, after, marriage, it, is, rare, but, not, unknown, for, an, english, speaking, man, to, take, his, wife, s, family, name, whether, for, personal, reasons, or, as, a, matter, of, tradition, such, as, among, matrilineal, canadian, aboriginal, groups, such, as, the, haida, and, gitxsan, upon, marriage, to, a, woman, men, in, the, united, states, can, change, their, surnames, to, that, of, their, wives, or, adopt, a, combination, of, both, names, with, the, federal, government, through, the, social, security, administration, men, may, face, difficulty, doing, so, on, the, state, level, in, some, states, it, is, exceedingly, rare, but, does, occur, in, the, united, states, where, a, married, couple, may, choose, an, entirely, new, last, name, by, going, through, a, legal, change, of, name, as, an, alternative, both, spouses, may, adopt, a, double, barrelled, name, for, instance, when, john, smith, and, mary, jones, marry, each, other, they, may, become, known, as, john, smith, jones, and, mary, smith, jones, a, spouse, may, also, opt, to, use, their, birth, name, as, a, middle, name, and, e, g, become, known, as, mary, jones, smith, an, additional, option, although, rarely, practiced, is, the, adoption, of, the, last, name, derived, from, a, blend, of, the, prior, names, such, as, simones, which, also, requires, a, legal, name, change, some, couples, keep, their, own, last, names, but, give, their, children, hyphenated, or, combined, surnames, in, 1979, the, united, nations, adopted, the, convention, on, the, elimination, of, all, forms, of, discrimination, against, women, cedaw, which, declared, in, effect, that, women, and, men, and, specifically, wife, and, husband, shall, have, the, same, rights, to, choose, a, family, name, as, well, as, a, profession, and, an, occupation, in, some, places, civil, rights, lawsuits, or, constitutional, amendments, changed, the, law, so, that, men, could, also, easily, change, their, married, names, e, g, in, british, columbia, and, california, qu, bec, law, permits, neither, spouse, to, change, surnames, in, france, until, 1, january, 2005, children, were, required, by, law, to, take, the, surname, of, their, father, article, 311, 21, of, the, french, civil, code, now, permits, parents, to, give, their, children, the, family, name, of, either, their, father, mother, or, hyphenation, of, both, although, no, more, than, two, names, can, be, hyphenated, in, cases, of, disagreement, both, names, are, used, in, alphabetical, order, this, brought, france, into, line, with, a, 1978, declaration, by, the, council, of, europe, requiring, member, governments, to, take, measures, to, adopt, equality, of, rights, in, the, transmission, of, family, names, a, measure, that, was, echoed, by, the, united, nations, in, 1979, similar, measures, were, adopted, by, west, germany, 1976, sweden, 1982, denmark, 1983, finland, 1985, and, spain, 1999, the, european, community, has, been, active, in, eliminating, gender, discrimination, several, cases, concerning, discrimination, in, family, names, have, reached, the, courts, burghartz, v, switzerland, challenged, the, lack, of, an, option, for, husbands, to, add, the, wife, s, surname, to, his, surname, which, they, had, chosen, as, the, family, name, when, this, option, was, available, for, women, losonci, rose, and, rose, v, switzerland, challenged, a, prohibition, on, foreign, men, married, to, swiss, women, keeping, their, surname, if, this, option, was, provided, in, their, national, law, an, option, available, to, women, nal, tekeli, v, turkey, challenged, prohibitions, on, women, using, their, surname, as, the, family, name, an, option, only, available, to, men, the, court, found, all, these, laws, to, be, in, violation, of, the, convention, from, 1945, to, 2021, in, the, czech, republic, women, by, law, had, to, use, family, names, with, the, ending, ov, after, the, name, of, their, father, or, husband, so, called, p, ech, len, this, was, seen, as, discriminatory, by, a, part, of, the, public, since, 1, january, 2022, czech, women, can, decide, for, themselves, whether, they, want, to, use, the, feminine, or, neutral, form, of, their, family, name, while, in, many, countries, surnames, are, usually, one, word, in, others, a, surname, may, contain, two, words, or, more, as, described, below, compound, surnames, in, english, and, several, other, european, cultures, feature, two, or, occasionally, more, words, often, joined, by, a, hyphen, or, hyphens, however, it, is, not, unusual, for, compound, surnames, to, be, composed, of, separate, words, not, linked, by, a, hyphen, for, example, iain, duncan, smith, a, former, leader, of, the, british, conservative, party, whose, surname, is, duncan, smith, some, chinese, surnames, use, more, than, one, character, in, spain, and, in, most, spanish, speaking, countries, the, custom, is, for, people, to, have, two, surnames, with, the, first, surname, coming, from, the, father, and, the, second, from, the, mother, the, opposite, order, is, now, legally, allowed, in, spain, but, still, unusual, in, informal, situations, typically, only, the, first, one, is, used, although, both, are, needed, for, legal, purposes, a, child, s, first, surname, will, usually, be, their, father, s, first, surname, while, the, child, s, second, surname, will, usually, be, their, mother, s, first, surname, for, example, if, jos, garc, a, torres, and, mar, a, acosta, g, mez, had, a, child, named, pablo, then, his, full, name, would, be, pablo, garc, a, acosta, one, family, member, s, relationship, to, another, can, often, be, identified, by, the, various, combinations, and, permutations, of, surnames, in, some, instances, when, an, individual, s, first, surname, is, very, common, such, as, for, example, in, jos, luis, rodr, guez, zapatero, the, second, surname, tends, to, gain, preeminence, over, the, first, one, in, informal, use, rodr, guez, zapatero, therefore, is, more, often, called, just, zapatero, and, almost, never, rodr, guez, only, in, other, cases, such, as, in, writer, mario, vargas, llosa, a, person, becomes, usually, called, by, both, surnames, this, changes, from, person, to, person, and, stems, merely, from, habit, in, spain, feminist, activism, pushed, for, a, law, approved, in, 1999, that, allows, an, adult, to, change, the, order, of, his, her, family, names, and, parents, can, also, change, the, order, of, their, children, s, family, names, if, they, and, the, child, if, over, 12, agree, although, this, order, must, be, the, same, for, all, their, children, in, spain, especially, catalonia, the, paternal, and, maternal, surnames, are, often, combined, using, the, conjunction, y, and, in, spanish, or, i, and, in, catalan, see, for, example, the, economist, xavier, sala, i, martin, or, painter, salvador, dal, i, dom, nech, in, spain, a, woman, does, not, generally, change, her, legal, surname, when, she, marries, in, some, spanish, speaking, countries, in, latin, america, a, woman, may, on, her, marriage, drop, her, mother, s, surname, and, add, her, husband, s, surname, to, her, father, s, surname, using, the, preposition, de, of, del, of, the, when, the, following, word, is, masculine, or, de, la, of, the, when, the, following, word, is, feminine, for, example, if, clara, reyes, alba, were, to, marry, alberto, g, mez, rodr, guez, the, wife, could, use, clara, reyes, de, g, mez, as, her, name, or, clara, reyes, g, mez, or, rarely, clara, g, mez, reyes, she, can, be, addressed, as, sra, de, g, mez, corresponding, to, mrs, g, mez, feminist, activists, have, criticized, this, custom, as, they, consider, it, sexist, in, some, countries, this, form, may, be, mainly, social, and, not, an, official, name, change, i, e, her, name, would, still, legally, be, her, birth, name, this, custom, begun, in, medieval, times, is, decaying, and, only, has, legal, validity, in, dominican, republic, ecuador, guatemala, nicaragua, honduras, peru, panama, and, to, a, certain, extent, in, mexico, where, it, is, optional, but, becoming, obsolete, but, is, frowned, upon, by, people, in, spain, cuba, and, elsewhere, in, peru, and, the, dominican, republic, women, normally, conserve, all, family, names, after, getting, married, for, example, if, rosa, mar, a, p, rez, mart, nez, marries, juan, mart, n, de, la, cruz, g, mez, she, will, be, called, rosa, mar, a, p, rez, mart, nez, de, de, la, cruz, and, if, the, husband, dies, she, will, be, called, rosa, mar, a, p, rez, mart, nez, vda, de, de, la, cruz, vda, being, the, abbreviation, for, viuda, widow, in, spanish, the, law, in, peru, changed, some, years, ago, and, all, married, women, can, keep, their, maiden, last, name, if, they, wish, with, no, alteration, historically, sometimes, a, father, transmitted, his, combined, family, names, thus, creating, a, new, one, e, g, the, paternal, surname, of, the, son, of, javier, given, name, reyes, paternal, family, name, de, la, barrera, maternal, surname, may, have, become, the, new, paternal, surname, reyes, de, la, barrera, for, example, uruguayan, politician, guido, manini, rios, has, inherited, a, compound, surname, constructed, from, the, patrilineal, and, matrilineal, surnames, of, a, recent, ancestor, de, is, also, the, nobiliary, particle, used, with, spanish, surnames, this, can, not, be, chosen, by, the, person, as, it, is, part, of, the, surname, for, example, puente, and, del, puente, are, not, the, same, surname, sometimes, for, single, mothers, or, when, the, father, would, or, could, not, recognize, the, child, the, mother, s, surname, has, been, used, twice, for, example, ana, reyes, reyes, in, spain, however, children, with, just, one, parent, receive, both, surnames, of, that, parent, although, the, order, may, also, be, changed, in, 1973, in, chile, the, law, was, changed, to, avoid, stigmatizing, illegitimate, children, with, the, maternal, surname, repeated, some, hispanic, people, after, leaving, their, country, drop, their, maternal, surname, even, if, not, formally, so, as, to, better, fit, into, the, non, hispanic, society, they, live, or, work, in, similarly, foreigners, with, just, one, surname, may, be, asked, to, provide, a, second, surname, on, official, documents, in, spanish, speaking, countries, when, none, such, as, the, mother, s, maiden, name, is, provided, the, last, name, may, simply, be, repeated, a, new, trend, in, the, united, states, for, hispanics, is, to, hyphenate, their, father, s, and, mother, s, last, names, this, is, done, because, american, born, english, speakers, are, not, aware, of, the, hispanic, custom, of, using, two, last, names, and, thus, mistake, the, first, last, name, of, the, individual, for, a, middle, name, in, doing, so, they, would, for, example, mistakenly, refer, to, esteban, lvarez, cobos, as, esteban, a, cobos, such, confusion, can, be, particularly, troublesome, in, official, matters, to, avoid, such, mistakes, esteban, lvarez, cobos, would, become, esteban, lvarez, cobos, to, clarify, that, both, are, last, names, in, some, churches, such, as, the, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, where, the, family, structure, is, emphasized, as, well, as, a, legal, marriage, the, wife, is, referred, to, as, hermana, plus, the, surname, of, her, husband, and, most, records, of, the, church, follow, that, structure, as, well, in, many, places, such, as, villages, in, catalonia, galicia, and, asturias, and, in, cuba, people, are, often, informally, known, by, the, name, of, their, dwelling, or, collective, family, nickname, rather, than, by, their, surnames, for, example, remei, pujol, i, serra, who, lives, at, ca, l, elvira, would, be, referred, to, as, remei, de, ca, l, elvira, and, adela, barreira, l, pez, who, is, part, of, the, provisores, family, would, be, known, as, adela, dos, provisores, also, in, many, places, such, as, cantabria, the, family, s, nickname, is, used, instead, of, the, surname, if, one, family, is, known, as, ecos, because, of, an, ancestor, who, was, known, as, ecu, they, would, be, jos, el, de, ecu, or, ana, la, de, ecu, collective, the, eco, s, some, common, nicknames, are, rubiu, blond, or, red, hair, roju, reddish, referring, to, their, red, hair, chiqui, small, jinchu, big, and, a, bunch, of, names, about, certain, characteristics, family, relationship, or, geographical, origin, pasiegu, masoniegu, sobanu, llebaniegu, tresmeranu, pejinu, naveru, merachu, tresneru, troule, mallavia, marotias, llamoso, lipa, ecu, tarugu, trapajeru, lich, n, andar, vel, beyond, the, seemingly, compound, surname, system, in, the, spanish, speaking, world, there, are, also, true, compound, surnames, these, true, compound, surnames, are, passed, on, and, inherited, as, compounds, for, instance, former, chairman, of, the, supreme, military, junta, of, ecuador, general, luis, telmo, paz, y, mi, o, estrella, has, luis, as, his, first, given, name, telmo, as, his, middle, name, the, true, compound, surname, paz, y, mi, o, as, his, first, i, e, paternal, surname, and, estrella, as, his, second, i, e, maternal, surname, luis, telmo, paz, y, mi, o, estrella, is, also, known, more, casually, as, luis, paz, y, mi, o, telmo, paz, y, mi, o, or, luis, telmo, paz, y, mi, o, he, would, never, be, regarded, as, luis, estrella, telmo, estrella, or, luis, telmo, estrella, nor, as, luis, paz, telmo, paz, or, luis, telmo, paz, this, is, because, paz, alone, is, not, his, surname, although, other, people, use, the, paz, surname, on, its, own, in, this, case, paz, y, mi, o, is, in, fact, the, paternal, surname, being, a, true, compound, surname, his, children, therefore, would, inherit, the, compound, surname, paz, y, mi, o, as, their, paternal, surname, while, estrella, would, be, lost, since, the, mother, s, paternal, surname, becomes, the, children, s, second, surname, as, their, own, maternal, surname, paz, alone, would, not, be, passed, on, nor, would, mi, o, alone, to, avoid, ambiguity, one, might, often, informally, see, these, true, compound, surnames, hyphenated, for, instance, as, paz, y, mi, o, this, is, true, especially, in, the, english, speaking, world, but, also, sometimes, even, in, the, hispanic, world, since, many, hispanics, are, unfamiliar, with, this, and, other, compound, surnames, paz, y, mi, o, might, be, inadvertently, mistaken, as, paz, for, the, paternal, surname, and, mi, o, for, the, maternal, surname, although, mi, o, did, start, off, as, the, maternal, surname, in, this, compound, surname, it, was, many, generations, ago, around, five, centuries, that, it, became, compounded, and, henceforth, inherited, and, passed, on, as, a, compound, other, surnames, which, started, off, as, compounds, of, two, or, more, surnames, but, which, merged, into, one, single, word, also, exist, an, example, would, be, the, surname, pazmi, o, whose, members, are, related, to, the, paz, y, mi, o, as, both, descend, from, the, paz, mi, o, family, of, five, centuries, ago, lava, spain, is, known, for, its, incidence, of, true, compound, surnames, characterized, for, having, the, first, portion, of, the, surname, as, a, patronymic, normally, a, spanish, patronymic, or, more, unusually, a, basque, patronymic, followed, by, the, preposition, de, with, the, second, part, of, the, surname, being, a, placename, from, lava, in, the, case, of, portuguese, naming, customs, the, main, surname, the, one, used, in, alpha, sorting, indexing, abbreviations, and, greetings, appears, last, each, person, usually, has, two, family, names, though, the, law, specifies, no, order, the, first, one, is, usually, the, maternal, family, name, whereas, the, last, one, is, commonly, the, paternal, family, name, in, portugal, a, person, s, full, name, has, a, minimum, legal, length, of, two, names, one, given, name, and, one, family, name, from, either, parent, and, a, maximum, of, six, names, two, first, names, and, four, surnames, he, or, she, may, have, up, to, four, surnames, in, any, order, desired, picked, up, from, the, total, of, his, her, parents, and, grandparents, surnames, the, use, of, any, surname, outside, this, lot, or, of, more, than, six, names, is, legally, possible, but, it, requires, dealing, with, bureaucracy, parents, or, the, person, him, herself, must, explain, the, claims, they, have, to, bear, that, surname, a, family, nickname, a, rare, surname, lost, in, past, generations, or, any, other, reason, one, may, find, suitable, in, brazil, there, is, no, limit, of, surnames, used, in, general, the, traditions, followed, in, countries, like, brazil, portugal, and, angola, are, somewhat, different, from, the, ones, in, spain, in, the, spanish, tradition, usually, the, father, s, surname, comes, first, followed, by, the, mother, s, surname, whereas, in, portuguese, speaking, countries, the, father, s, name, is, the, last, mother, s, coming, first, a, woman, may, adopt, her, husband, s, surname, s, but, nevertheless, she, usually, keeps, her, birth, name, or, at, least,
