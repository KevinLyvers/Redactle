remorse, is, a, distressing, emotion, experienced, by, an, individual, who, regrets, actions, which, they, have, done, in, the, past, that, they, deem, to, be, shameful, hurtful, or, wrong, remorse, is, closely, allied, to, guilt, and, self, directed, resentment, when, a, person, regrets, an, earlier, action, or, failure, to, act, it, may, be, because, of, remorse, or, in, response, to, various, other, consequences, including, being, punished, for, the, act, or, omission, people, may, express, remorse, through, apologies, trying, to, repair, the, damage, they, ve, caused, or, self, imposed, punishments, in, a, legal, context, the, perceived, remorse, of, an, offender, is, assessed, by, western, justice, systems, during, trials, sentencing, parole, hearings, and, in, restorative, justice, however, there, are, epistemological, problems, with, assessing, an, offender, s, level, of, remorse, a, person, who, is, incapable, of, feeling, remorse, is, often, diagnosed, with, antisocial, personality, disorder, as, characterized, in, the, dsm, iv, tr, in, general, a, person, needs, to, be, unable, to, feel, fear, as, well, as, remorse, in, order, to, develop, psychopathic, traits, legal, and, business, professions, such, as, insurance, have, done, research, on, the, expression, of, remorse, via, apologies, primarily, because, of, the, potential, litigation, and, financial, implications, studies, on, apologizing, include, the, five, languages, of, apology, by, gary, chapman, and, jennifer, thomas, and, on, apology, by, aaron, lazare, these, studies, indicate, that, effective, apologies, that, express, remorse, typically, include, as, well, apologies, usually, include, a, statement, or, expression, of, regret, humility, or, remorse, a, request, for, forgiveness, and, an, expression, of, a, credible, commitment, to, change, or, a, promise, that, it, will, not, happen, again, apologies, may, also, include, some, form, of, restitution, compensation, or, token, gesture, in, line, with, the, damage, that, one, has, caused, john, kleefeld, has, encapsulated, this, into, four, rs, that, typically, make, for, a, fully, effective, apology, remorse, responsibility, resolution, and, reparation, when, an, apology, is, delayed, for, instance, if, a, friend, has, been, wronged, and, the, offending, party, does, not, apologise, the, perception, of, the, offense, can, compound, over, time, this, is, sometimes, known, as, compounding, remorse, compunction, in, modern, times, generally, denoting, a, relatively, slight, pricking, of, conscience, formerly, expressed, connotations, of, actively, expressing, remorse, usually, requiring, remorseful, individuals, to, physically, approach, the, person, to, whom, they, wish, to, express, regret, medieval, style, compunction, could, serve, as, an, incentive, to, partake, in, the, sacrament, of, confession, or, penance, in, a, study, led, by, leanne, ten, brinke, a, professor, at, the, university, of, british, columbia, participants, genuine, and, falsified, emotions, were, studied, to, investigate, behavioral, and, facial, cues, brinke, and, others, found, a, significant, difference, in, the, presence, of, facial, expressions, in, real, and, false, remorse, with, falsified, emotions, of, remorse, they, found, that, the, participants, experienced, a, greater, range, of, emotions, which, are, close, to, genuine, feelings, while, deceptive, descriptions, of, remorse, were, associated, with, positive, emotions, such, as, happiness, and, surprise, the, positive, emotions, felt, by, participants, demonstrating, a, deceptive, description, of, remorse, are, likely, due, to, the, leakage, of, genuine, feelings, from, incomplete, deception, brinke, and, others, established, that, participants, appeared, surprised, because, they, could, only, raise, their, eyebrows, when, trying, to, appear, sad, which, then, caused, the, participants, to, feel, embarrassed, feel, genuine, happiness, and, let, a, smile, slip, in, contrast, to, deceptive, and, falsified, accounts, genuine, accounts, were, expressed, with, fewer, emotions, participants, showing, deceptive, or, falsified, emotions, overcompensated, their, emotional, performance, genuine, negative, feelings, of, remorse, leaked, by, the, lower, face, were, immediately, covered, up, with, a, neutral, expression, brinke, recorded, a, small, number, of, body, language, and, verbal, cues, for, deceptive, participants, instead, she, recorded, a, large, number, of, speech, hesitations, that, cued, deceptive, and, falsified, accounts, of, remorse, current, findings, of, deceptive, and, falsified, remorse, have, a, practical, use, for, measuring, the, veracity, of, remorseful, displays, for, judges, jurors, parole, officers, and, psychologists, when, sentencing, offenders, psychopathic, individuals, are, best, known, for, their, flagrant, disregard, for, social, and, moral, norms, psychopaths, have, dysfunctional, personal, relationships, characterized, by, violence, exploitation, and, philandering, emotionally, they, are, incapable, of, feeling, guilt, or, empathy, they, respond, abnormally, to, fear, and, pain, and, other, emotions, are, shallow, compared, to, population, norms, psychopaths, refuse, to, adopt, social, and, moral, norms, because, they, are, not, swayed, by, the, emotions, such, as, guilt, remorse, or, fear, of, retribution, that, influence, other, human, beings, human, societies, tend, to, value, remorse, conversely, a, person, who, exhibits, a, lack, of, remorse, is, often, perceived, in, a, negative, light, it, is, widely, accepted, that, remorse, is, the, proper, reaction, to, misconduct, remorse, may, originate, in, from, either, actual, or, contrived, regret, for, the, misconduct, that, results, in, being, caught, or, causing, harm, research, has, shown, that, the, facial, expressions, of, offenders, on, trial, affect, the, jury, s, attitude, and, in, turn, the, sentencing, decision, while, remorse, may, present, guilt, that, may, influence, a, jury, s, decision, a, lack, of, remorse, influences, the, jury, even, more, because, it, is, one, trait, of, psychopathy, psychopathy, represents, a, configuration, of, traits, that, are, missing, within, a, person, s, personality, such, as, a, lack, of, empathy, and, remorse, knowledge, of, psychopathic, traits, has, been, shown, to, affect, how, jurors, perceive, adult, and, juvenile, offenders, assessments, of, psychopathy, are, introduced, to, direct, a, relatively, wide, variety, of, questions, in, the, legal, system, so, investigators, have, started, examining, the, effects, of, psychopathy, evidences, through, simulations, in, studies, by, john, edens, who, is, a, psychology, professor, at, texas, a, m, university, data, suggests, that, attributing, psychopathic, traits, to, adult, and, juvenile, offenders, can, have, a, noticeable, negative, effect, on, how, these, individuals, are, viewed, by, others, remorselessness, a, key, feature, of, psychopathy, proves, to, be, a, strong, predictor, of, juror, attitudes, in, the, study, by, john, edens, a, pool, of, offenders, were, labeled, as, either, having, a, disorder, condition, or, having, no, disorder, those, labeled, as, disorder, were, given, death, verdicts, by, mock, jurors, in, the, study, traits, such, as, callousness, remorselessness, and, superficial, charm, were, a, strong, predictor, of, negative, consequences, for, the, offenders, this, study, found, that, remorselessness, has, the, largest, effect, on, the, mock, jurors, opinions, of, the, disorder, offenders, and, it, explains, support, for, the, death, sentence, the, results, of, this, study, suggest, that, free, of, mental, health, testimonies, perceptions, of, a, defendant, s, personality, traits, may, have, serious, implications, in, the, sentencing, decisions, of, a, capital, case, one, study, on, psychopaths, found, that, under, certain, circumstances, they, could, willfully, empathize, with, others, and, that, their, empathic, reaction, initiated, the, same, way, it, does, for, controls, psychopathic, criminals, were, brain, scanned, while, watching, videos, of, a, person, harming, another, individual, the, psychopaths, empathic, reaction, initiated, the, same, way, it, did, for, controls, when, they, were, instructed, to, empathize, with, the, harmed, individual, and, the, area, of, the, brain, relating, to, pain, was, activated, when, the, psychopaths, were, asked, to, imagine, how, the, harmed, individual, felt, the, research, suggests, psychopaths, can, switch, empathy, on, at, will, which, would, enable, them, to, be, both, callous, and, charming, the, team, who, conducted, the, study, say, they, do, not, know, how, to, transform, this, willful, empathy, into, the, spontaneous, empathy, most, people, have, though, they, propose, it, might, be, possible, to, rehabilitate, psychopaths, by, helping, them, to, activate, their, empathy, switch, others, suggested, that, it, remains, unclear, whether, psychopaths, experience, of, empathy, was, the, same, as, that, of, controls, and, also, questioned, the, possibility, of, devising, therapeutic, interventions, that, would, make, the, empathic, reactions, more, automatic, one, problem, with, the, theory, that, the, ability, to, turn, empathy, on, and, off, constitutes, psychopathy, is, that, such, a, theory, would, classify, socially, sanctioned, violence, and, punishment, as, psychopathy, as, these, entail, suspending, empathy, towards, certain, individuals, and, or, groups, the, attempt, to, get, around, this, by, standardizing, tests, of, psychopathy, for, cultures, with, different, norms, of, punishment, is, criticized, in, this, context, for, being, based, on, the, assumption, that, people, can, be, classified, in, discrete, cultures, while, cultural, influences, are, in, reality, mixed, and, every, person, encounters, a, mosaic, of, influences, psychopathy, may, be, an, artefact, of, psychiatry, s, standardization, along, imaginary, sharp, lines, between, cultures, as, opposed, to, an, actual, difference, in, the, brain, work, conducted, by, professor, jean, decety, with, large, samples, of, incarcerated, psychopaths, offers, additional, insights, in, one, study, psychopaths, were, scanned, while, viewing, video, clips, depicting, people, being, intentionally, hurt, they, were, also, tested, on, their, responses, to, seeing, short, videos, of, facial, expressions, of, pain, the, participants, in, the, high, psychopathy, group, exhibited, significantly, less, activation, in, the, ventromedial, prefrontal, cortex, amygdala, and, periaqueductal, gray, parts, of, the, brain, but, more, activity, in, the, striatum, and, the, insula, when, compared, to, control, participants, in, a, second, study, individuals, with, psychopathy, exhibited, a, strong, response, in, pain, affective, brain, regions, when, taking, an, imagine, self, perspective, but, failed, to, recruit, the, neural, circuits, that, were, activated, in, controls, during, an, imagine, other, perspective, in, particular, the, ventromedial, prefrontal, cortex, and, amygdala, which, may, contribute, to, their, lack, of, empathic, concern, researchers, have, investigated, whether, people, who, have, high, levels, of, psychopathy, have, sufficient, levels, of, cognitive, empathy, but, lack, the, ability, to, use, affective, empathy, people, who, score, highly, on, psychopathy, measures, are, less, likely, to, exhibit, affective, empathy, there, was, a, strong, negative, correlation, showing, that, psychopathy, and, lack, of, affective, empathy, correspond, strongly, the, danva, 2, found, those, who, scored, highly, on, the, psychopathy, scale, do, not, lack, in, recognising, emotion, in, facial, expressions, therefore, such, individuals, do, not, lack, in, perspective, talking, ability, but, do, lack, in, compassion, and, concern, towards, the, wellbeing, of, others, in, fact, in, an, experiment, published, in, march, 2007, at, the, university, of, southern, california, neuroscientist, antonio, r, damasio, and, his, colleagues, showed, that, subjects, with, damage, to, the, ventromedial, prefrontal, cortex, lack, the, ability, to, empathically, feel, their, way, to, moral, answers, and, that, when, confronted, with, moral, dilemmas, these, brain, damaged, patients, coldly, came, up, with, end, justifies, the, means, answers, leading, damasio, to, conclude, that, the, point, was, not, that, they, reached, immoral, conclusions, but, that, when, they, were, confronted, by, a, difficult, issue, in, this, case, as, whether, to, shoot, down, a, passenger, plane, hijacked, by, terrorists, before, it, hits, a, major, city, these, patients, appear, to, reach, decisions, without, the, anguish, that, afflicts, those, with, normally, functioning, brains, according, to, adrian, raine, a, clinical, neuroscientist, also, at, the, university, of, southern, california, one, of, this, study, s, implications, is, that, society, may, have, to, rethink, how, it, judges, immoral, people, psychopaths, often, feel, no, empathy, or, remorse, without, that, awareness, people, relying, exclusively, on, reasoning, seem, to, find, it, harder, to, sort, their, way, through, moral, thickets, does, that, mean, they, should, be, held, to, different, standards, of, accountability, psychopathic, individuals, do, not, show, regret, or, remorse, this, was, thought, to, be, due, to, an, inability, to, generate, this, emotion, in, response, to, negative, outcomes, however, in, 2016, people, with, antisocial, personality, disorder, also, known, as, dissocial, personality, disorder, were, found, to, experience, regret, but, did, not, use, the, regret, to, guide, their, choice, in, behavior, there, was, no, lack, of, regret, but, a, problem, to, think, through, a, range, of, potential, actions, and, estimating, the, outcome, values, the, perception, of, remorse, is, essential, to, an, apology, and, the, greater, the, perception, of, remorse, the, more, effective, the, apology, an, effective, apology, reduces, negative, consequences, and, facilitates, cognitive, and, behavioral, changes, associated, with, forgiveness, with, empathy, as, the, mediator, between, apologies, and, forgiveness, and, remorse, as, the, essential, part, to, an, apology, one, can, expect, empathy, to, mediate, perceived, remorse, forgiveness, remorse, may, signal, that, one, is, suffering, psychologically, because, of, one, s, negative, behavior, which, leads, to, empathy, from, the, victim, who, may, then, express, forgiveness, in, a, study, by, james, davis, and, greg, gold, 170, university, students, filled, out, questionnaires, about, forgiveness, within, interpersonal, relationships, davis, and, gold, s, findings, suggest, that, when, a, victim, perceives, an, apology, to, be, remorseful, then, they, believe, the, negative, behavior, will, not, occur, again, and, they, will, be, more, willing, to, forgive, the, perpetrator, remorse, is, closely, linked, with, the, willingness, to, humble, oneself, and, to, repent, for, one, s, misdeeds, remorse, is, not, as, such, when, defined, through, the, view, of, self, condemnation, self, condemnation, more, so, than, remorse, is, said, to, be, associated, with, poor, psychological, well, being, remorse, captures, feelings, of, guilt, regret, and, sorrow, forgiveness, does, not, eliminate, all, negative, feelings, but, it, may, entail, the, reduction, of, bitter, and, angry, feelings, not, feelings, of, disappointment, regret, or, sorrow, a, study, by, mickie, fisher, found, that, people, who, forgive, themselves, for, serious, offenses, may, continue, to, harbor, remorse, or, regret, in, contrast, to, remorse, self, condemnation, reflects, a, more, global, negative, severe, stance, toward, oneself, remorse, may, convey, a, sense, of, sorrow, while, self, condemnation, suggests, the, kind, of, loathing, and, desire, for, punishment, that, characterizes, interpersonal, grudges, fisher, suggests, that, self, forgiveness, does, not, necessarily, require, one, to, get, rid, of, feelings, or, regret, or, remorse, based, on, the, study, by, fisher, self, forgiveness, seems, to, relate, more, closely, to, self, condemnation, and, not, remorse, when, trying, to, convince, people, to, forgive, themselves, it, is, crucial, not, to, erase, the, potentially, adaptive, feelings, of, remorse, along, with, the, more, destructive, self, condemnation, people, can, grow, and, experience, prosocial, behaviors, once, they, accept, responsibility, for, their, own, transgressions, for, genuine, self, forgiveness, one, must, first, accept, responsibility, for, their, offenses, and, not, rush, to, rid, themselves, of, guilty, feelings, purchases, can, be, divided, into, two, different, categories, material, or, experiential, a, material, good, is, made, to, be, kept, in, the, buyer, s, possession, while, an, experiential, good, provides, the, buyer, with, life, experience, a, material, good, provides, the, buyer, with, a, more, enduring, pleasure, compared, with, an, experiential, as, these, two, purchases, also, result, in, different, types, of, regret, while, experiential, purchases, bring, about, regrets, of, a, missed, opportunity, material, purchases, result, in, buyer, s, remorse, which, means, that, a, person, dwells, on, how, their, material, purchase, measure, up, to, other, purchases, they, could, have, made, and, how, it, compares, with, other, people, s, purchases, these, comparisons, diminish, satisfaction, from, the, original, purpose, past, research, explains, that, regrets, of, action, are, intense, but, only, in, the, short, term, while, regrets, of, inaction, gains, intensity, over, time, and, dominates, people, s, experience, major, life, choices, such, as, marriage, jobs, and, education, are, often, the, focus, of, regret, everyday, experience, suggests, that, everyday, decisions, are, the, most, frequent, causes, of, regret, marketing, directors, know, the, effects, of, buyer, s, remorse, and, use, it, to, their, advantage, when, planning, marketing, strategies, the, regret, felt, over, choosing, a, material, over, an, experiential, purchase, depends, on, the, pain, of, the, factors, underlying, the, purchase, based, on, research, by, thomas, gilovich, and, emily, rosenzwig, material, purchases, are, more, likely, to, lead, to, regret, while, experiential, purchases, give, the, buyer, more, satisfaction, even, over, time
