in, language, a, clause, is, a, constituent, or, phrase, that, comprises, a, semantic, predicand, expressed, or, not, and, a, semantic, predicate, a, typical, clause, consists, of, a, subject, and, a, syntactic, predicate, the, latter, typically, a, verb, phrase, composed, of, a, verb, with, or, without, any, objects, and, other, modifiers, however, the, subject, is, sometimes, unexpressed, if, it, is, easily, deductable, from, the, context, especially, in, null, subject, language, but, also, in, other, languages, including, instances, of, the, imperative, mood, in, english, a, complete, simple, sentence, contains, a, single, clause, with, a, finite, verb, complex, sentences, contain, at, least, one, clause, subordinated, dependent, to, an, independent, clause, one, that, could, stand, alone, as, a, simple, sentence, which, may, be, co, ordinated, with, other, independents, with, or, without, dependents, some, dependent, clauses, are, non, finite, i, e, does, not, contain, any, element, verb, marking, a, specific, tense, a, primary, division, for, the, discussion, of, clauses, is, the, distinction, between, independent, clauses, and, dependent, clauses, an, independent, clause, can, stand, alone, i, e, it, can, constitute, a, complete, sentence, by, itself, a, dependent, clause, by, contrast, relies, on, an, independent, clause, s, presence, to, be, efficiently, utilizable, a, second, significant, distinction, concerns, the, difference, between, finite, and, non, finite, clauses, a, finite, clause, contains, a, structurally, central, finite, verb, whereas, the, structurally, central, word, of, a, non, finite, clause, is, often, a, non, finite, verb, traditional, grammar, focuses, on, finite, clauses, the, awareness, of, non, finite, clauses, having, arisen, much, later, in, connection, with, the, modern, study, of, syntax, the, discussion, here, also, focuses, on, finite, clauses, although, some, aspects, of, non, finite, clauses, are, considered, further, below, clauses, can, be, classified, according, to, a, distinctive, trait, that, is, a, prominent, characteristic, of, their, syntactic, form, the, position, of, the, finite, verb, is, one, major, trait, used, for, classification, and, the, appearance, of, a, specific, type, of, focusing, word, e, g, wh, word, is, another, these, two, criteria, overlap, to, an, extent, which, means, that, often, no, single, aspect, of, syntactic, form, is, always, decisive, in, deciding, how, the, clause, functions, there, are, however, strong, tendencies, standard, sv, clauses, subject, verb, are, the, norm, in, english, they, are, usually, declarative, as, opposed, to, exclamative, imperative, or, interrogative, they, express, information, neutrally, e, g, declarative, clauses, like, these, are, by, far, the, most, frequently, occurring, type, of, clause, in, any, language, they, can, be, viewed, as, basic, with, other, clause, types, being, derived, from, them, standard, sv, clauses, can, also, be, interrogative, or, exclamative, however, given, the, appropriate, intonation, contour, and, or, the, appearance, of, a, question, word, e, g, examples, like, these, demonstrate, that, how, a, clause, functions, cannot, be, known, based, entirely, on, a, single, distinctive, syntactic, criterion, sv, clauses, are, usually, declarative, but, intonation, and, or, the, appearance, of, a, question, word, can, render, them, interrogative, or, exclamative, verb, first, clauses, in, english, usually, play, one, of, three, roles, 1, they, express, a, yes, no, question, via, subject, auxiliary, inversion, 2, they, express, a, condition, as, an, embedded, clause, or, 3, they, express, a, command, via, imperative, mood, e, g, most, verb, first, clauses, are, independent, clauses, verb, first, conditional, clauses, however, must, be, classified, as, embedded, clauses, because, they, cannot, stand, alone, in, english, wh, clauses, contain, a, wh, word, wh, words, often, serve, to, help, express, a, constituent, question, they, are, also, prevalent, though, as, relative, pronouns, in, which, case, they, serve, to, introduce, a, relative, clause, and, are, not, part, of, a, question, the, wh, word, focuses, a, particular, constituent, and, most, of, the, time, it, appears, in, clause, initial, position, the, following, examples, illustrate, standard, interrogative, wh, clauses, the, b, sentences, are, direct, questions, independent, clauses, and, the, c, sentences, contain, the, corresponding, indirect, questions, embedded, clauses, one, important, aspect, of, matrix, wh, clauses, is, that, subject, auxiliary, inversion, is, obligatory, when, something, other, than, the, subject, is, focused, when, it, is, the, subject, or, something, embedded, in, the, subject, that, is, focused, however, subject, auxiliary, inversion, does, not, occur, another, important, aspect, of, wh, clauses, concerns, the, absence, of, subject, auxiliary, inversion, in, embedded, clauses, as, illustrated, in, the, c, examples, just, produced, subject, auxiliary, inversion, is, obligatory, in, matrix, clauses, when, something, other, than, the, subject, is, focused, but, it, never, occurs, in, embedded, clauses, regardless, of, the, constituent, that, is, focused, a, systematic, distinction, in, word, order, emerges, across, matrix, wh, clauses, which, can, have, vs, order, and, embedded, wh, clauses, which, always, maintain, sv, order, e, g, relative, clauses, are, a, mixed, group, in, english, they, can, be, standard, sv, clauses, if, they, are, introduced, by, that, or, lack, a, relative, pronoun, entirely, or, they, can, be, wh, clauses, if, they, are, introduced, by, a, wh, word, that, serves, as, a, relative, pronoun, embedded, clauses, can, be, categorized, according, to, their, syntactic, function, in, terms, of, predicate, argument, structures, they, can, function, as, arguments, as, adjuncts, or, as, predicative, expressions, that, is, embedded, clauses, can, be, an, argument, of, a, predicate, an, adjunct, on, a, predicate, or, part, of, the, predicate, itself, the, predicate, in, question, is, usually, the, predicate, of, an, independent, clause, but, embedding, of, predicates, is, also, frequent, a, clause, that, functions, as, the, argument, of, a, given, predicate, is, known, as, an, argument, clause, argument, clauses, can, appear, as, subjects, as, objects, and, as, obliques, they, can, also, modify, a, noun, predicate, in, which, case, they, are, known, as, content, clauses, the, following, examples, illustrate, argument, clauses, that, provide, the, content, of, a, noun, such, argument, clauses, are, content, clauses, the, content, clauses, like, these, in, the, a, sentences, are, arguments, relative, clauses, introduced, by, the, relative, pronoun, that, as, in, the, b, clauses, here, have, an, outward, appearance, that, is, closely, similar, to, that, of, content, clauses, the, relative, clauses, are, adjuncts, however, not, arguments, adjunct, clauses, are, embedded, clauses, that, modify, an, entire, predicate, argument, structure, all, clause, types, sv, verb, first, wh, can, function, as, adjuncts, although, the, stereotypical, adjunct, clause, is, sv, and, introduced, by, a, subordinator, i, e, subordinate, conjunction, e, g, after, because, before, now, etc, e, g, these, adjunct, clauses, modify, the, entire, matrix, clause, thus, before, you, did, in, the, first, example, modifies, the, matrix, clause, fred, arrived, adjunct, clauses, can, also, modify, a, nominal, predicate, the, typical, instance, of, this, type, of, adjunct, is, a, relative, clause, e, g, an, embedded, clause, can, also, function, as, a, predicative, expression, that, is, it, can, form, part, of, the, predicate, of, a, greater, clause, these, predicative, clauses, are, functioning, just, like, other, predicative, expressions, e, g, predicative, adjectives, that, was, good, and, predicative, nominals, that, was, the, truth, they, form, the, matrix, predicate, together, with, the, copula, some, of, the, distinctions, presented, above, are, represented, in, syntax, trees, these, trees, make, the, difference, between, main, and, subordinate, clauses, very, clear, and, they, also, illustrate, well, the, difference, between, argument, and, adjunct, clauses, the, following, dependency, grammar, trees, show, that, embedded, clauses, are, dependent, on, an, element, in, the, independent, clause, often, on, a, verb, the, independent, clause, comprises, the, entire, trees, in, both, instances, whereas, the, embedded, clauses, constitute, arguments, of, the, respective, independent, clauses, the, embedded, wh, clause, what, we, want, is, the, object, argument, of, the, predicate, know, the, embedded, clause, that, he, is, gaining, is, the, subject, argument, of, the, predicate, is, motivating, both, of, these, argument, clauses, are, dependent, on, the, verb, of, the, matrix, clause, the, following, trees, identify, adjunct, clauses, using, an, arrow, dependency, edge, these, two, embedded, clauses, are, adjunct, clauses, because, they, provide, circumstantial, information, that, modifies, a, superordinate, expression, the, first, is, a, dependent, of, the, main, verb, of, the, matrix, clause, and, the, second, is, a, dependent, of, the, object, noun, the, arrow, dependency, edges, identify, them, as, adjuncts, the, arrow, points, away, from, the, adjunct, towards, it, governor, to, indicate, that, semantic, selection, is, running, counter, to, the, direction, of, the, syntactic, dependency, the, adjunct, is, selecting, its, governor, the, next, four, trees, illustrate, the, distinction, mentioned, above, between, matrix, wh, clauses, and, embedded, wh, clauses, the, embedded, wh, clause, is, an, object, argument, each, time, the, position, of, the, wh, word, across, the, matrix, clauses, a, trees, and, the, embedded, clauses, b, trees, captures, the, difference, in, word, order, matrix, wh, clauses, have, v2, word, order, whereas, embedded, wh, clauses, have, what, amounts, to, v3, word, order, in, the, matrix, clauses, the, wh, word, is, a, dependent, of, the, finite, verb, whereas, it, is, the, head, over, the, finite, verb, in, the, embedded, wh, clauses, there, has, been, confusion, about, the, distinction, between, clauses, and, phrases, this, confusion, is, due, in, part, to, how, these, concepts, are, employed, in, the, phrase, structure, grammars, of, the, chomskyan, tradition, in, the, 1970s, chomskyan, grammars, began, labeling, many, clauses, as, cps, i, e, complementizer, phrases, or, as, ips, i, e, inflection, phrases, and, then, later, as, tps, i, e, tense, phrases, etc, the, choice, of, labels, was, influenced, by, the, theory, internal, desire, to, use, the, labels, consistently, the, x, bar, schema, acknowledged, at, least, three, projection, levels, for, every, lexical, head, a, minimal, projection, e, g, n, v, p, etc, an, intermediate, projection, e, g, n, v, p, etc, and, a, phrase, level, projection, e, g, np, vp, pp, etc, extending, this, convention, to, the, clausal, categories, occurred, in, the, interest, of, the, consistent, use, of, labels, this, use, of, labels, should, not, however, be, confused, with, the, actual, status, of, the, syntactic, units, to, which, the, labels, are, attached, a, more, traditional, understanding, of, clauses, and, phrases, maintains, that, phrases, are, not, clauses, and, clauses, are, not, phrases, there, is, a, progression, in, the, size, and, status, of, syntactic, units, words, phrases, clauses, the, characteristic, trait, of, clauses, i, e, the, presence, of, a, subject, and, a, finite, verb, is, absent, from, phrases, clauses, can, be, however, embedded, inside, phrases, the, central, word, of, a, non, finite, clause, is, usually, a, non, finite, verb, as, opposed, to, a, finite, verb, there, are, various, types, of, non, finite, clauses, that, can, be, acknowledged, based, in, part, on, the, type, of, non, finite, verb, at, hand, gerunds, are, widely, acknowledged, to, constitute, non, finite, clauses, and, some, modern, grammars, also, judge, many, to, infinitives, to, be, the, structural, locus, of, non, finite, clauses, finally, some, modern, grammars, also, acknowledge, so, called, small, clauses, which, often, lack, a, verb, altogether, it, should, be, apparent, that, non, finite, clauses, are, by, and, large, embedded, clauses, the, underlined, words, in, the, following, examples, are, considered, non, finite, clauses, e, g, each, of, the, gerunds, in, the, a, sentences, stopping, attempting, and, cheating, constitutes, a, non, finite, clause, the, subject, predicate, relationship, that, has, long, been, taken, as, the, defining, trait, of, clauses, is, fully, present, in, the, a, sentences, the, fact, that, the, b, sentences, are, also, acceptable, illustrates, the, enigmatic, behavior, of, gerunds, they, seem, to, straddle, two, syntactic, categories, they, can, function, as, non, finite, verbs, or, as, nouns, when, they, function, as, nouns, as, in, the, b, sentences, it, is, debatable, whether, they, constitute, clauses, since, nouns, are, not, generally, taken, to, be, constitutive, of, clauses, some, modern, theories, of, syntax, take, many, to, infinitives, to, be, constitutive, of, non, finite, clauses, this, stance, is, supported, by, the, clear, predicate, status, of, many, to, infinitives, it, is, challenged, however, by, the, fact, that, to, infinitives, do, not, take, an, overt, subject, e, g, the, to, infinitives, to, consider, and, to, explain, clearly, qualify, as, predicates, because, they, can, be, negated, they, do, not, however, take, overt, subjects, the, subjects, she, and, he, are, dependents, of, the, matrix, verbs, refuses, and, attempted, respectively, not, of, the, to, infinitives, data, like, these, are, often, addressed, in, terms, of, control, the, matrix, predicates, refuses, and, attempted, are, control, verbs, they, control, the, embedded, predicates, consider, and, explain, which, means, they, determine, which, of, their, arguments, serves, as, the, subject, argument, of, the, embedded, predicate, some, theories, of, syntax, posit, the, null, subject, pro, i, e, pronoun, to, help, address, the, facts, of, control, constructions, e, g, with, the, presence, of, pro, as, a, null, subject, to, infinitives, can, be, construed, as, complete, clauses, since, both, subject, and, predicate, are, present, pro, theory, is, particular, to, one, tradition, in, the, study, of, syntax, and, grammar, government, and, binding, theory, minimalist, program, other, theories, of, syntax, and, grammar, e, g, head, driven, phrase, structure, grammar, construction, grammar, dependency, grammar, reject, the, presence, of, null, elements, such, as, pro, which, means, they, are, likely, to, reject, the, stance, that, to, infinitives, constitute, clauses, another, type, of, construction, that, some, schools, of, syntax, and, grammar, view, as, non, finite, clauses, is, the, so, called, small, clause, a, typical, small, clause, consists, of, a, noun, phrase, and, a, predicative, expression, e, g, the, subject, predicate, relationship, is, clearly, present, in, the, underlined, strings, the, expression, on, the, right, is, a, predication, over, the, noun, phrase, immediately, to, its, left, while, the, subject, predicate, relationship, is, indisputably, present, the, underlined, strings, do, not, behave, as, single, constituents, a, fact, that, undermines, their, status, as, clauses, hence, one, can, debate, whether, the, underlined, strings, in, these, examples, should, qualify, as, clauses, the, layered, structures, of, the, chomskyan, tradition, are, again, likely, to, view, the, underlined, strings, as, clauses, whereas, the, schools, of, syntax, that, posit, flatter, structures, are, likely, to, reject, clause, status, for, them
