writes, that, organizations, are, a, narrow, version, of, institutions, or, represent, a, cluster, of, institutions, the, two, are, distinct, in, the, sense, that, organizations, contain, internal, institutions, that, govern, interactions, between, the, members, of, the, organizations, the, study, of, organizations, includes, a, focus, on, optimising, organizational, structure, according, to, management, science, most, human, organizations, fall, roughly, into, four, types, these, consist, of, a, group, of, peers, who, decide, as, a, group, perhaps, by, voting, the, difference, between, a, jury, and, a, committee, is, that, the, members, of, the, committee, are, usually, assigned, to, perform, or, lead, further, actions, after, the, group, comes, to, a, decision, whereas, members, of, a, jury, come, to, a, decision, in, common, law, countries, legal, juries, render, decisions, of, guilt, liability, and, quantify, damages, juries, are, also, used, in, athletic, contests, book, awards, and, similar, activities, sometimes, a, selection, committee, functions, like, a, jury, in, the, middle, ages, juries, in, continental, europe, were, used, to, determine, the, law, according, to, consensus, among, local, notables, committees, are, often, the, most, reliable, way, to, make, decisions, condorcet, s, jury, theorem, proved, that, if, the, average, member, votes, better, than, a, roll, of, dice, then, adding, more, members, increases, the, number, of, majorities, that, can, come, to, a, correct, vote, however, correctness, is, defined, the, problem, is, that, if, the, average, member, is, subsequently, worse, than, a, roll, of, dice, the, committee, s, decisions, grow, worse, not, better, therefore, staffing, is, crucial, parliamentary, procedure, such, as, robert, s, rules, of, order, helps, prevent, committees, from, engaging, in, lengthy, discussions, without, reaching, decisions, this, organizational, structure, promotes, internal, competition, inefficient, components, of, the, organization, starve, while, effective, ones, get, more, work, everybody, is, paid, for, what, they, actually, do, and, so, runs, a, tiny, business, that, has, to, show, a, profit, or, they, are, fired, companies, that, utilize, this, organization, type, reflect, a, rather, one, sided, view, of, what, goes, on, in, ecology, it, is, also, the, case, that, a, natural, ecosystem, has, a, natural, border, ecoregions, do, not, in, general, compete, with, one, another, in, any, way, but, are, very, autonomous, the, pharmaceutical, company, glaxosmithkline, talks, about, functioning, as, this, type, of, organization, in, this, external, article, from, the, guardian, by, bastian, batac, de, leon, this, organizational, type, assigns, each, worker, two, bosses, in, two, different, hierarchies, one, hierarchy, is, functional, and, assures, that, each, type, of, expert, in, the, organization, is, well, trained, and, measured, by, a, boss, who, is, a, super, expert, in, the, same, field, the, other, direction, is, executive, and, tries, to, get, projects, completed, using, the, experts, projects, might, be, organized, by, products, regions, customer, types, or, some, other, schemes, as, an, example, a, company, might, have, an, individual, with, overall, responsibility, for, products, x, and, y, and, another, individual, with, overall, responsibility, for, engineering, quality, control, etc, therefore, subordinates, responsible, for, quality, control, of, project, x, will, have, two, reporting, lines, the, united, states, aerospace, industries, were, the, first, to, officially, use, this, organizational, structure, after, it, emerged, in, the, early, 1960s, a, hierarchy, exemplifies, an, arrangement, with, a, leader, who, leads, other, individual, members, of, the, organization, this, arrangement, is, often, associated, with, the, basis, that, there, are, enough, to, imagine, a, real, pyramid, if, there, are, not, enough, stone, blocks, to, hold, up, the, higher, ones, gravity, would, irrevocably, bring, down, the, monumental, structure, so, one, can, imagine, that, if, the, leader, does, not, have, the, support, of, his, subordinates, the, entire, structure, will, collapse, hierarchies, were, satirized, in, the, peter, principle, 1969, a, book, that, introduced, hierarchiology, and, the, saying, that, in, a, hierarchy, every, employee, tends, to, rise, to, his, level, of, incompetence, in, the, social, sciences, organizations, are, the, object, of, analysis, for, a, number, of, disciplines, such, as, sociology, economics, political, science, psychology, management, and, organizational, communication, the, broader, analysis, of, organizations, is, commonly, referred, to, as, organizational, structure, organizational, studies, organizational, behavior, or, organization, analysis, a, number, of, different, perspectives, exist, some, of, which, are, compatible, sociology, can, be, defined, as, the, science, of, the, institutions, of, modernity, specific, institutions, serve, a, function, akin, to, the, individual, organs, of, a, coherent, body, in, the, social, and, political, sciences, in, general, an, organization, may, be, more, loosely, understood, as, the, planned, coordinated, and, purposeful, action, of, human, beings, working, through, collective, action, to, reach, a, common, goal, or, construct, a, tangible, product, this, action, is, usually, framed, by, formal, membership, and, form, institutional, rules, sociology, distinguishes, the, term, organization, into, planned, formal, and, unplanned, informal, i, e, spontaneously, formed, organizations, sociology, analyses, organizations, in, the, first, line, from, an, institutional, perspective, in, this, sense, the, organization, is, an, enduring, arrangement, of, elements, these, elements, and, their, actions, are, determined, by, rules, so, that, a, certain, task, can, be, fulfilled, through, a, system, of, coordinated, division, of, labor, economic, approaches, to, organizations, also, take, the, division, of, labor, as, a, starting, point, the, division, of, labor, allows, for, economies, of, specialization, increasing, specialization, necessitates, coordination, from, an, economic, point, of, view, markets, and, organizations, are, alternative, coordination, mechanisms, for, the, execution, of, transactions, an, organization, is, defined, by, the, elements, that, are, part, of, it, who, belongs, to, the, organization, and, who, does, not, its, communication, which, elements, communicate, and, how, do, they, communicate, its, autonomy, which, changes, are, executed, autonomously, by, the, organization, or, its, elements, and, its, rules, of, action, compared, to, outside, events, what, causes, an, organization, to, act, as, a, collective, actor, by, coordinated, and, planned, cooperation, of, the, elements, the, organization, is, able, to, solve, tasks, that, lie, beyond, the, abilities, of, the, single, element, the, price, paid, by, the, elements, is, the, limitation, of, the, degrees, of, freedom, of, the, elements, advantages, of, organizations, are, enhancement, more, of, the, same, addition, combination, of, different, features, and, extension, disadvantages, can, be, inertness, through, coordination, and, loss, of, interaction, among, the, theories, that, are, or, have, been, influential, are, a, leader, in, a, formal, hierarchical, organization, is, appointed, to, a, managerial, position, and, has, the, right, to, command, and, enforce, obedience, by, virtue, of, the, authority, of, his, position, however, he, must, possess, adequate, personal, attributes, to, match, his, authority, because, authority, is, only, potentially, available, to, him, in, the, absence, of, sufficient, personal, competence, a, manager, may, be, confronted, by, an, emergent, leader, who, can, challenge, his, role, in, the, organization, and, reduce, it, to, that, of, a, figurehead, however, only, the, authority, of, position, has, the, backing, of, formal, sanctions, it, follows, that, whoever, wields, personal, influence, and, power, can, legitimize, this, only, by, gaining, a, formal, position, in, the, hierarchy, with, commensurate, authority, an, organization, that, is, established, as, a, means, for, achieving, defined, objectives, has, been, referred, to, as, a, formal, organization, its, design, specifies, how, goals, are, subdivided, and, reflected, in, subdivisions, of, the, organization, divisions, departments, sections, positions, jobs, and, tasks, make, up, this, work, structure, thus, the, formal, organization, is, expected, to, behave, impersonally, in, regard, to, relationships, with, clients, or, with, its, members, according, to, weber, s, definition, entry, and, subsequent, advancement, is, by, merit, or, seniority, each, employee, receives, a, salary, and, enjoys, a, degree, of, tenure, that, safeguards, him, from, the, arbitrary, influence, of, superiors, or, of, powerful, clients, the, higher, his, position, in, the, hierarchy, the, greater, his, presumed, expertise, in, adjudicating, problems, that, may, arise, in, the, course, of, the, work, carried, out, at, lower, levels, of, the, organization, it, is, this, bureaucratic, structure, that, forms, the, basis, for, the, appointment, of, heads, or, chiefs, of, administrative, subdivisions, in, the, organization, and, endows, them, with, the, authority, attached, to, their, position, in, contrast, to, the, appointed, head, or, chief, of, an, administrative, unit, a, leader, emerges, within, the, context, of, the, informal, organization, that, underlies, the, formal, structure, the, informal, organization, expresses, the, personal, objectives, and, goals, of, the, individual, membership, their, objectives, and, goals, may, or, may, not, coincide, with, those, of, the, formal, organization, the, informal, organization, represents, an, extension, of, the, social, structures, that, generally, characterize, human, life, the, spontaneous, emergence, of, groups, and, organizations, as, ends, in, themselves, in, prehistoric, times, man, was, preoccupied, with, his, personal, security, maintenance, protection, and, survival, now, man, spends, a, major, portion, of, his, waking, hours, working, for, organizations, his, need, to, identify, with, a, community, that, provides, security, protection, maintenance, and, a, feeling, of, belonging, continues, unchanged, from, prehistoric, times, this, need, is, met, by, the, informal, organization, and, its, emergent, or, unofficial, leaders, leaders, emerge, from, within, the, structure, of, the, informal, organization, their, personal, qualities, the, demands, of, the, situation, or, a, combination, of, these, and, other, factors, attract, followers, who, accept, their, leadership, within, one, or, several, overlay, structures, instead, of, the, authority, of, position, held, by, an, appointed, head, or, chief, the, emergent, leader, wields, influence, or, power, influence, is, the, ability, of, a, person, to, gain, cooperation, from, others, by, means, of, persuasion, or, control, over, rewards, power, is, a, stronger, form, of, influence, because, it, reflects, a, person, s, ability, to, enforce, action, through, the, control, of, a, means, of, punishment, as, most, organizations, operate, through, a, mix, of, formal, and, informal, mechanisms, organization, science, scholars, have, paid, attention, to, the, type, of, interplay, between, formal, and, informal, organizations, on, the, one, hand, some, have, argued, that, formal, and, informal, organizations, operate, as, substitutes, as, one, type, of, organization, would, decrease, the, advantages, of, using, the, other, one, for, instance, if, parties, trust, each, other, the, use, of, a, formal, contract, is, unnecessary, or, even, detrimental, to, the, relationship, on, the, other, hand, other, scholars, have, suggested, that, formal, and, informal, organizations, can, complement, each, other, for, instance, formal, mechanisms, of, control, can, pave, the, way, for, the, development, of, relational, norms
