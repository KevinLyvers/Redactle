etymology, t, m, l, d, i, et, im, ol, jee, is, the, scientific, study, of, the, origin, and, evolution, of, a, word, s, semantic, meaning, across, time, including, its, constituent, morphemes, and, phonemes, it, is, a, subfield, of, historical, linguistics, philology, and, semiotics, and, draws, upon, comparative, semantics, morphology, pragmatics, and, phonetics, in, order, to, construct, a, comprehensive, and, chronological, catalogue, of, all, meanings, that, a, morpheme, phoneme, word, or, sign, has, carried, across, time, for, languages, with, a, long, written, history, etymologists, make, use, of, texts, and, texts, about, the, language, to, gather, knowledge, about, how, words, were, used, during, earlier, periods, how, they, developed, in, meaning, and, form, or, when, and, how, they, entered, the, language, etymologists, also, apply, the, methods, of, comparative, linguistics, to, reconstruct, information, about, forms, that, are, too, old, for, any, direct, information, to, be, available, by, analyzing, related, languages, with, a, technique, known, as, the, comparative, method, linguists, can, make, inferences, about, their, shared, parent, language, and, its, vocabulary, in, this, way, word, roots, in, many, european, languages, for, example, can, be, traced, back, to, the, origin, of, the, indo, european, language, family, even, though, etymological, research, originated, from, the, philological, tradition, much, current, etymological, research, is, done, on, language, families, where, little, or, no, early, documentation, is, available, such, as, uralic, and, austronesian, the, word, etymology, is, derived, from, the, ancient, greek, word, itself, from, meaning, true, sense, or, sense, of, a, truth, and, the, suffix, logia, denoting, the, study, or, logic, of, the, term, etymon, refers, to, the, predicate, i, e, stem, or, root, from, which, a, later, word, or, morpheme, derives, for, example, the, latin, word, candidus, which, means, white, is, the, etymon, of, english, candid, relationships, are, often, less, transparent, however, english, place, names, such, as, winchester, gloucester, tadcaster, share, in, different, modern, forms, a, suffixed, etymon, that, was, once, meaningful, latin, castrum, fort, reflex, is, the, name, given, to, a, descendant, word, in, a, daughter, language, descended, from, an, earlier, language, for, example, modern, english, heat, is, the, reflex, of, the, old, english, h, tu, rarely, this, word, is, used, in, reverse, and, the, reflex, is, actually, the, root, word, rather, than, the, descendant, word, however, this, usage, is, usually, filled, by, the, term, etymon, instead, a, reflex, will, sometimes, be, described, simply, as, a, descendant, derivative, or, derived, from, an, etymon, but, see, below, cognates, or, lexical, cognates, are, sets, of, words, that, have, been, inherited, in, direct, descent, from, an, etymological, ancestor, in, a, common, parent, language, doublets, or, etymological, twins, or, twinlings, or, possibly, triplets, and, so, forth, are, specifically, cognates, within, the, same, language, although, they, have, the, same, etymological, root, they, tend, to, have, different, phonological, forms, and, to, have, entered, the, language, through, different, routes, a, root, is, the, source, of, related, words, within, a, single, language, no, language, barrier, is, crossed, similar, to, the, distinction, between, etymon, and, root, a, nuanced, distinction, can, sometimes, be, made, between, a, descendant, and, a, derivative, a, derivative, is, one, of, the, words, which, have, their, source, in, a, root, word, and, were, at, some, time, created, from, the, root, word, using, morphological, constructs, such, as, suffixes, prefixes, and, slight, changes, to, the, vowels, or, to, the, consonants, of, the, root, word, for, example, unhappy, happily, and, unhappily, are, all, derivatives, of, the, root, word, happy, the, terms, root, and, derivative, are, used, in, the, analysis, of, morphological, derivation, within, a, language, in, studies, that, are, not, concerned, with, historical, linguistics, and, that, do, not, cross, the, language, barrier, etymologists, apply, a, number, of, methods, to, study, the, origins, of, words, some, of, which, are, etymological, theory, recognizes, that, words, originate, through, a, limited, number, of, basic, mechanisms, the, most, important, of, which, are, language, change, borrowing, i, e, the, adoption, of, loanwords, from, other, languages, word, formation, such, as, derivation, and, compounding, and, onomatopoeia, and, sound, symbolism, i, e, the, creation, of, imitative, words, such, as, click, or, grunt, while, the, origin, of, newly, emerged, words, is, often, more, or, less, transparent, it, tends, to, become, obscured, through, time, due, to, sound, change, or, semantic, change, due, to, sound, change, it, is, not, readily, obvious, that, the, english, word, set, is, related, to, the, word, sit, the, former, is, originally, a, causative, formation, of, the, latter, it, is, even, less, obvious, that, bless, is, related, to, blood, the, former, was, originally, a, derivative, with, the, meaning, to, mark, with, blood, semantic, change, may, also, occur, for, example, the, english, word, bead, originally, meant, prayer, it, acquired, its, modern, meaning, through, the, practice, of, counting, the, recitation, of, prayers, by, using, beads, the, search, for, meaningful, origins, for, familiar, or, strange, words, is, far, older, than, the, modern, understanding, of, linguistic, evolution, and, the, relationships, of, languages, which, began, no, earlier, than, the, 18th, century, from, antiquity, through, the, 17th, century, from, p, ini, to, pindar, to, sir, thomas, browne, etymology, had, been, a, form, of, witty, wordplay, in, which, the, supposed, origins, of, words, were, creatively, imagined, to, satisfy, contemporary, requirements, for, example, the, greek, poet, pindar, born, in, approximately, 522, bce, employed, inventive, etymologies, to, flatter, his, patrons, plutarch, employed, etymologies, insecurely, based, on, fancied, resemblances, in, sounds, isidore, of, seville, s, etymologiae, was, an, encyclopedic, tracing, of, first, things, that, remained, uncritically, in, use, in, europe, until, the, sixteenth, century, etymologicum, genuinum, is, a, grammatical, encyclopedia, edited, at, constantinople, in, the, ninth, century, one, of, several, similar, byzantine, works, the, thirteenth, century, legenda, aurea, as, written, by, jacobus, de, varagine, begins, each, vita, of, a, saint, with, a, fanciful, excursus, in, the, form, of, an, etymology, the, sanskrit, linguists, and, grammarians, of, ancient, india, were, the, first, to, make, a, comprehensive, analysis, of, linguistics, and, etymology, the, study, of, sanskrit, etymology, has, provided, western, scholars, with, the, basis, of, historical, linguistics, and, modern, etymology, four, of, the, most, famous, sanskrit, linguists, are, these, linguists, were, not, the, earliest, sanskrit, grammarians, however, they, followed, a, line, of, ancient, grammarians, of, sanskrit, who, lived, several, centuries, earlier, like, sakatayana, of, whom, very, little, is, known, the, earliest, of, attested, etymologies, can, be, found, in, vedic, literature, in, the, philosophical, explanations, of, the, brahmanas, aranyakas, and, upanishads, the, analyses, of, sanskrit, grammar, done, by, the, previously, mentioned, linguists, involved, extensive, studies, on, the, etymology, called, nirukta, or, vyutpatti, in, sanskrit, of, sanskrit, words, because, the, ancient, indians, considered, sound, and, speech, itself, to, be, sacred, and, for, them, the, words, of, the, sacred, vedas, contained, deep, encoding, of, the, mysteries, of, the, soul, and, god, one, of, the, earliest, philosophical, texts, of, the, classical, greek, period, to, address, etymology, was, the, socratic, dialogue, cratylus, c, 360, bce, by, plato, during, much, of, the, dialogue, socrates, makes, guesses, as, to, the, origins, of, many, words, including, the, names, of, the, gods, in, his, odes, pindar, spins, complimentary, etymologies, to, flatter, his, patrons, plutarch, life, of, numa, pompilius, spins, an, etymology, for, pontifex, while, explicitly, dismissing, the, obvious, and, actual, bridge, builder, the, priests, called, pontifices, have, the, name, of, pontifices, from, potens, powerful, because, they, attend, the, service, of, the, gods, who, have, power, and, command, overall, others, make, the, word, refer, to, exceptions, of, impossible, cases, the, priests, were, to, perform, all, the, duties, possible, if, anything, lays, beyond, their, power, the, exception, was, not, to, be, cavilled, the, most, common, opinion, is, the, most, absurd, which, derives, this, word, from, pons, and, assigns, the, priests, the, title, of, bridge, makers, the, sacrifices, performed, on, the, bridge, were, amongst, the, most, sacred, and, ancient, and, the, keeping, and, repairing, of, the, bridge, attached, like, any, other, public, sacred, office, to, the, priesthood, isidore, of, seville, compiled, a, volume, of, etymologies, to, illuminate, the, triumph, of, religion, each, saint, s, legend, in, jacobus, de, varagine, s, legenda, aurea, begins, with, an, etymological, discourse, on, the, saint, s, name, lucy, is, said, of, light, and, light, is, beauty, in, beholding, after, that, s, ambrose, saith, the, nature, of, light, is, such, she, is, gracious, in, beholding, she, spreadeth, over, all, without, lying, down, she, passeth, in, going, right, without, crooking, by, right, long, line, and, it, is, without, dilation, of, tarrying, and, therefore, it, is, showed, the, blessed, lucy, hath, beauty, of, virginity, without, any, corruption, essence, of, charity, without, disordinate, love, rightful, going, and, devotion, to, god, without, squaring, out, of, the, way, right, long, line, by, continual, work, without, negligence, of, slothful, tarrying, in, lucy, is, said, the, way, of, light, etymology, in, the, modern, sense, emerged, in, the, late, 18th, century, european, academia, within, the, context, of, the, wider, age, of, enlightenment, although, preceded, by, 17th, century, pioneers, such, as, marcus, zuerius, van, boxhorn, gerardus, vossius, stephen, skinner, elisha, coles, and, william, wotton, the, first, known, systematic, attempt, to, prove, the, relationship, between, two, languages, on, the, basis, of, similarity, of, grammar, and, lexicon, was, made, in, 1770, by, the, hungarian, j, nos, sajnovics, when, he, attempted, to, demonstrate, the, relationship, between, sami, and, hungarian, work, that, was, later, extended, to, the, whole, finno, ugric, language, family, in, 1799, by, his, fellow, countryman, samuel, gyarmathi, the, origin, of, modern, historical, linguistics, is, often, traced, to, sir, william, jones, a, welsh, philologist, living, in, india, who, in, 1782, observed, the, genetic, relationship, between, sanskrit, greek, and, latin, jones, published, his, the, sanscrit, language, in, 1786, laying, the, foundation, for, the, field, of, indo, european, linguistics, the, study, of, etymology, in, germanic, philology, was, introduced, by, rasmus, christian, rask, in, the, early, 19th, century, and, elevated, to, a, high, standard, with, the, german, dictionary, of, the, brothers, grimm, the, successes, of, the, comparative, approach, culminated, in, the, neogrammarian, school, of, the, late, 19th, century, still, in, the, 19th, century, german, philosopher, friedrich, nietzsche, used, etymological, strategies, principally, and, most, famously, in, on, the, genealogy, of, morals, but, also, elsewhere, to, argue, that, moral, values, have, definite, historical, specifically, cultural, origins, where, modulations, in, meaning, regarding, certain, concepts, such, as, good, and, evil, show, how, these, ideas, had, changed, over, time, according, to, which, value, system, appropriated, them, this, strategy, gained, popularity, in, the, 20th, century, and, philosophers, such, as, jacques, derrida, have, used, etymologies, to, indicate, former, meanings, of, words, to, de, center, the, violent, hierarchies, of, western, philosophy
