when, it, comes, to, bride, wealth, in, pre, capitalist, zulu, society, ilobolo, was, inextricably, linked, to, the, ownership, of, cattle, during, that, time, there, was, not, a, fixed, number, of, cattle, required, for, the, wedding, to, happen, it, could, be, paid, before, the, marriage, or, during, the, marriage, the, groom, takes, the, cattle, from, his, father, s, herd, to, perpetuate, the, family, heritage, nonetheless, this, ritual, changed, during, colonisation, because, in, 1869, theophilus, shepstone, then, natal, secretary, for, native, affairs, formalized, the, ilobolo, payment, to, 10, cattle, for, commoners, plus, the, ingquthu, cow, for, the, mother, 15, for, hereditary, chief, siblings, and, 20, plus, for, the, daughters, of, a, chief, they, found, it, too, lenient, to, let, the, groom, give, whatever, amount, he, wanted, so, they, decided, to, establish, a, specific, number, of, cattle, that, would, be, needed, before, or, at, the, start, of, the, marriage, this, has, been, accepted, by, zulu, men, who, were, educated, in, mission, schools, but, according, to, more, ritual, people, this, became, untraditional, additionally, with, the, instauration, of, the, natal, code, some, zulu, men, decided, to, settle, another, way, in, which, they, could, decrease, the, ilobo, offer, a, token, payment, or, bring, a, present, for, the, father, of, the, prospective, bride, to, decrease, the, ilobolo, amount, to, be, paid, the, payment, of, ilobolo, can, be, difficult, for, some, families, but, as, it, is, often, considered, a, symbol, of, pride, and, respect, many, are, willing, to, maintain, this, tradition, as, long, as, possible
