air, pollution, is, the, contamination, of, air, due, to, the, presence, of, substances, called, pollutants, in, the, atmosphere, that, are, harmful, to, the, health, of, humans, and, other, living, beings, or, cause, damage, to, the, climate, or, to, materials, it, is, also, the, contamination, of, the, indoor, or, outdoor, environment, either, by, chemical, physical, or, biological, agents, that, alters, the, natural, features, of, the, atmosphere, there, are, many, different, types, of, air, pollutants, such, as, gases, including, ammonia, carbon, monoxide, sulfur, dioxide, nitrous, oxides, methane, and, chlorofluorocarbons, particulates, both, organic, and, inorganic, and, biological, molecules, air, pollution, can, cause, diseases, allergies, and, even, death, to, humans, it, can, also, cause, harm, to, other, living, organisms, such, as, animals, and, crops, and, may, damage, the, natural, environment, for, example, climate, change, ozone, depletion, or, habitat, degradation, or, built, environment, for, example, acid, rain, air, pollution, can, be, caused, by, both, human, activities, and, natural, phenomena, air, quality, is, closely, related, to, the, earth, s, climate, and, ecosystems, globally, many, of, the, contributors, of, air, pollution, are, also, sources, of, greenhouse, emission, i, e, burning, of, fossil, fuel, air, pollution, is, a, significant, risk, factor, for, a, number, of, pollution, related, diseases, including, respiratory, infections, heart, disease, chronic, obstructive, pulmonary, disease, copd, stroke, and, lung, cancer, growing, evidence, suggests, that, air, pollution, exposure, may, be, associated, with, reduced, iq, scores, impaired, cognition, increased, risk, for, psychiatric, disorders, such, as, depression, and, detrimental, perinatal, health, the, human, health, effects, of, poor, air, quality, are, far, reaching, but, principally, affect, the, body, s, respiratory, system, and, the, cardiovascular, system, individual, reactions, to, air, pollutants, depend, on, the, type, of, pollutant, a, person, is, exposed, to, the, degree, of, exposure, and, the, individual, s, health, status, and, genetics, air, pollution, is, the, largest, environmental, risk, factor, for, disease, and, premature, death, and, the, fourth, largest, risk, factor, overall, for, human, health, air, pollution, causes, the, premature, deaths, of, around, 7, million, people, worldwide, each, year, or, a, global, mean, loss, of, life, expectancy, lle, of, 2, 9, years, and, there, has, been, no, significant, change, in, the, number, of, deaths, caused, by, all, forms, of, pollution, since, at, least, 2015, outdoor, air, pollution, attributable, to, fossil, fuel, use, alone, causes, 3, 61, million, deaths, annually, making, it, one, of, the, top, contributors, to, human, death, anthropogenic, ozone, causes, around, 470, 000, premature, deaths, a, year, and, fine, particulate, pm, 2, 5, pollution, around, another, 2, 1, million, the, scope, of, the, air, pollution, crisis, is, large, in, 2018, who, estimated, that, 9, out, of, 10, people, breathe, air, containing, high, levels, of, pollutants, although, the, health, consequences, are, extensive, the, way, the, problem, is, handled, is, considered, largely, haphazard, or, neglected, the, world, bank, has, estimated, that, welfare, losses, premature, deaths, and, productivity, losses, lost, labour, caused, by, air, pollution, cost, the, world, economy, 5, trillion, per, year, the, costs, of, air, pollution, are, generally, an, externality, to, the, contemporary, economic, system, and, most, human, activity, although, they, are, sometimes, recovered, through, monitoring, legislation, and, regulation, many, different, technologies, and, strategies, are, available, for, reducing, air, pollution, although, a, majority, of, countries, have, air, pollution, laws, according, to, unep, 43, percent, of, countries, lack, a, legal, definition, of, air, pollution, 31, percent, lack, outdoor, air, quality, standards, 49, percent, restrict, their, definition, to, outdoor, pollution, only, and, just, 31, percent, have, laws, for, tackling, pollution, originating, from, outside, their, borders, national, air, quality, laws, have, often, been, highly, effective, notably, the, 1956, clean, air, act, in, britain, and, the, us, clean, air, act, introduced, in, 1963, some, of, these, efforts, have, been, successful, at, the, international, level, such, as, the, montreal, protocol, which, reduced, the, release, of, harmful, ozone, depleting, chemicals, and, the, 1985, helsinki, protocol, which, reduced, sulfur, emissions, while, others, such, as, international, action, on, climate, change, have, been, less, successful, there, are, many, different, sources, of, air, pollution, some, air, pollutants, such, as, nitrogen, oxides, originate, mainly, from, human, activities, while, some, notably, radon, gas, come, mostly, from, natural, sources, however, many, air, pollutants, including, dust, and, sulfur, dioxide, come, from, a, mixture, of, natural, and, human, sources, there, are, also, sources, from, processes, other, than, combustion, air, pollutant, emission, factors, are, reported, representative, values, that, aim, to, link, the, quantity, of, a, pollutant, released, into, the, ambient, air, to, an, activity, connected, with, that, pollutant, s, release, the, weight, of, the, pollutant, divided, by, a, unit, weight, volume, distance, or, time, of, the, activity, generating, the, pollutant, is, how, these, factors, are, commonly, stated, e, g, kilograms, of, particulate, emitted, per, tonne, of, coal, burned, these, criteria, make, estimating, emissions, from, diverse, sources, of, pollution, easier, most, of, the, time, these, components, are, just, averages, of, all, available, data, of, acceptable, quality, and, they, are, thought, to, be, typical, of, long, term, averages, the, stockholm, convention, on, persistent, organic, pollutants, identified, pesticides, and, other, persistent, organic, pollutants, of, concern, these, include, dioxins, and, furans, which, are, unintentionally, created, by, combustion, of, organics, like, open, burning, of, plastics, and, are, endocrine, disruptors, and, mutagens, the, united, states, environmental, protection, agency, has, published, a, compilation, of, air, pollutant, emission, factors, for, a, wide, range, of, industrial, sources, the, united, kingdom, australia, canada, and, many, other, countries, have, published, similar, compilations, as, well, as, the, european, environment, agency, an, air, pollutant, is, a, material, in, the, air, that, can, have, many, effects, on, humans, and, the, ecosystem, the, substance, can, be, solid, particles, liquid, droplets, or, gases, and, often, takes, the, form, of, an, aerosol, solid, particles, or, liquid, droplets, dispersed, and, carried, by, a, gas, a, pollutant, can, be, of, natural, origin, or, man, made, pollutants, are, classified, as, primary, or, secondary, primary, pollutants, are, usually, produced, by, processes, such, as, ash, from, a, volcanic, eruption, other, examples, include, carbon, monoxide, gas, from, motor, vehicle, exhausts, or, sulfur, dioxide, released, from, factories, secondary, pollutants, are, not, emitted, directly, rather, they, form, in, the, air, when, primary, pollutants, react, or, interact, ground, level, ozone, is, a, prominent, example, of, a, secondary, pollutant, some, pollutants, may, be, both, primary, and, secondary, they, are, both, emitted, directly, and, formed, from, other, primary, pollutants, pollutants, emitted, into, the, atmosphere, by, human, activity, include, secondary, pollutants, include, there, are, many, other, chemicals, classed, as, hazardous, air, pollutants, some, of, these, are, regulated, in, the, usa, under, the, clean, air, act, and, in, europe, under, numerous, directives, including, the, air, framework, directive, 96, 62, ec, on, ambient, air, quality, assessment, and, management, directive, 98, 24, ec, on, risks, related, to, chemical, agents, at, work, and, directive, 2004, 107, ec, covering, heavy, metals, and, polycyclic, aromatic, hydrocarbons, in, ambient, air, the, risk, of, air, pollution, is, determined, by, the, pollutant, s, hazard, and, the, amount, of, exposure, to, that, pollutant, air, pollution, exposure, can, be, measured, for, a, person, a, group, such, as, a, neighborhood, or, a, country, s, children, or, an, entire, population, for, example, one, would, want, to, determine, a, geographic, area, s, exposure, to, a, dangerous, air, pollution, taking, into, account, the, various, microenvironments, and, age, groups, this, can, be, calculated, as, an, inhalation, exposure, this, would, account, for, daily, exposure, in, various, settings, e, g, different, indoor, micro, environments, and, outdoor, locations, the, exposure, needs, to, include, different, ages, and, other, demographic, groups, especially, infants, children, pregnant, women, and, other, sensitive, subpopulations, for, each, specific, time, that, the, subgroup, is, in, the, setting, and, engaged, in, particular, activities, the, exposure, to, an, air, pollutant, must, integrate, the, concentrations, of, the, air, pollutant, with, regard, to, the, time, spent, in, each, setting, and, the, respective, inhalation, rates, for, each, subgroup, playing, cooking, reading, working, spending, time, in, traffic, etc, a, little, child, s, inhaling, rate, for, example, will, be, lower, than, that, of, an, adult, a, young, person, engaging, in, strenuous, exercise, will, have, a, faster, rate, of, breathing, than, a, child, engaged, in, sedentary, activity, the, daily, exposure, must, therefore, include, the, amount, of, time, spent, in, each, micro, environmental, setting, as, well, as, the, kind, of, activities, performed, there, the, air, pollutant, concentration, in, each, microactivity, microenvironmental, setting, is, summed, to, indicate, the, exposure, for, some, pollutants, such, as, black, carbon, traffic, related, exposures, may, dominate, total, exposure, despite, short, exposure, times, since, high, concentrations, coincide, with, proximity, to, major, roads, or, participation, in, motorized, traffic, a, large, portion, of, total, daily, exposure, occurs, as, short, peaks, of, high, concentrations, but, it, remains, unclear, how, to, define, peaks, and, determine, their, frequency, and, health, impact, in, 2021, the, who, halved, its, recommended, guideline, limit, for, tiny, particles, from, burning, fossil, fuels, the, new, limit, for, nitrogen, dioxide, no, 2, is, 75, lower, growing, evidence, that, air, pollution, even, when, experienced, at, very, low, levels, hurts, human, health, led, the, who, to, revise, its, guideline, from, 10, g, m, 3, to, 5, g, m, 3, for, what, it, considers, a, safe, level, of, exposure, of, particulate, pollution, bringing, most, of, the, world, 97, 3, percent, of, the, global, population, into, the, unsafe, zone, a, lack, of, ventilation, indoors, concentrates, air, pollution, where, people, often, spend, the, majority, of, their, time, indoor, air, pollution, can, pose, a, significant, health, risk, according, to, epa, reports, the, concentrations, of, many, air, pollutants, can, be, two, to, five, times, higher, in, indoor, air, than, in, outdoor, air, indoor, air, pollutants, can, be, up, to, 100, times, higher, in, some, cases, than, they, are, inside, people, can, spend, up, to, 90, of, their, time, indoors, according, to, the, american, lung, association, alp, the, us, consumer, product, safety, commission, cpsc, 2012, and, the, us, environmental, protection, agency, 2012a, indoor, contaminants, that, can, cause, pollution, include, asbestos, biologic, agents, building, materials, radon,

health, status, and, genetics, the, most, common, sources, of, air, pollution, include, particulates, and, ozone, often, from, burning, fossil, fuels, nitrogen, dioxide, and, sulfur, dioxide, children, aged, less, than, five, years, who, live, in, developing, countries, are, the, most, vulnerable, population, to, death, attributable, to, indoor, and, outdoor, air, pollution, under, the, clean, air, act, u, s, epa, sets, limits, on, certain, air, pollutants, including, setting, limits, on, how, much, can, be, in, the, air, anywhere, in, the, united, states, mixed, exposure, to, both, carbon, black, and, ozone, could, result, in, significantly, greater, health, affects, estimates, of, deaths, toll, due, to, air, pollution, vary, in, 2014, the, world, health, organization, estimated, that, every, year, air, pollution, causes, the, premature, death, of, 7, million, people, worldwide, 1, in, 8, deaths, worldwide, a, study, published, in, 2019, indicated, that, in, 2015, the, number, may, be, closer, to, 8, 8, million, with, 5, 5, million, of, these, premature, deaths, due, to, air, pollution, from, anthropogenic, sources, a, 2022, review, concluded, that, in, 2019, air, pollution, was, responsible, for, approximately, million, deaths, it, concluded, that, since, 2015, little, real, progress, against, pollution, has, been, made, causes, of, deaths, include, strokes, heart, disease, copd, lung, cancer, and, lung, infections, children, are, particularly, at, risk, in, 2021, the, who, reported, that, outdoor, air, pollution, was, estimated, to, cause, 4, 2, million, premature, deaths, worldwide, in, 2019, the, global, mean, loss, of, life, expectancy, lle, similar, to, ypll, from, air, pollution, in, 2015, was, 2, 9, years, substantially, more, than, for, example, 0, 3, years, from, all, forms, of, direct, violence, communities, with, persons, that, live, beyond, 85, years, have, low, ambient, air, pollution, suggesting, a, link, between, air, pollution, levels, and, longevity, the, who, estimates, that, in, 2016, 58, of, outdoor, air, pollution, related, premature, deaths, were, due, to, ischaemic, heart, disease, and, stroke, the, mechanisms, linking, air, pollution, to, increased, cardiovascular, mortality, are, uncertain, but, probably, include, pulmonary, and, systemic, inflammation, india, and, china, have, the, highest, death, rate, due, to, air, pollution, india, also, has, more, deaths, from, asthma, than, any, other, nation, according, to, the, world, health, organization, in, 2019, 1, 6, million, deaths, in, india, were, caused, by, air, pollution, in, 2013, air, pollution, was, estimated, to, kill, 500, 000, people, in, china, each, year, in, 2012, 2, 48, of, china, s, total, air, pollution, emissions, were, caused, by, exports, due, to, us, demand, causing, an, additional, 27, 963, deaths, across, 30, provinces, annual, premature, european, deaths, caused, by, air, pollution, are, estimated, at, 430, 000, to, 800, 000, an, important, cause, of, these, deaths, is, nitrogen, dioxide, and, other, nitrogen, oxides, nox, emitted, by, road, vehicles, across, the, european, union, air, pollution, is, estimated, to, reduce, life, expectancy, by, almost, nine, months, in, a, 2015, consultation, document, the, uk, government, disclosed, that, nitrogen, dioxide, is, responsible, for, 23, 500, premature, uk, deaths, per, annum, there, is, a, positive, correlation, between, pneumonia, related, deaths, and, air, pollution, from, motor, vehicle, emissions, in, england, eliminating, energy, related, fossil, fuel, emissions, in, the, united, states, would, prevent, 46, 900, 59, 400, premature, deaths, each, year, and, provide, 537, 678, billion, in, benefits, from, avoided, pm, 2, 5, related, illness, and, death, a, study, published, in, 2023, in, science, focused, on, sulfur, dioxide, emissions, by, coal, power, plants, coal, pm, 2, 5, and, concluded, that, exposure, to, coal, pm, 2, 5, was, associated, with, 2, 1, times, greater, mortality, risk, than, exposure, to, pm, 2, 5, from, all, sources, from, 1999, to, 2020, a, total, of, 460, 000, deaths, in, the, us, were, attributed, to, coal, pm, 2, 5, the, largest, cause, of, air, pollution, is, fossil, fuel, combustion, mostly, the, production, and, use, of, cars, electricity, production, and, heating, there, are, estimated, 4, 5, million, annual, premature, deaths, worldwide, due, to, pollutants, released, by, high, emission, power, stations, and, vehicle, exhausts, diesel, exhaust, de, is, a, major, contributor, to, combustion, derived, particulate, matter, air, pollution, in, several, human, experimental, studies, using, a, well, validated, exposure, chamber, setup, de, has, been, linked, to, acute, vascular, dysfunction, and, increased, thrombus, formation, a, study, concluded, that, pm, 2, 5, air, pollution, induced, by, the, contemporary, free, trade, and, consumption, by, the, 19, g20, nations, causes, two, million, premature, deaths, annually, suggesting, that, the, average, lifetime, consumption, of, about, 28, people, in, these, countries, causes, at, least, one, premature, death, average, age, 67, while, developing, countries, cannot, be, expected, to, implement, or, be, able, to, implement, countermeasures, without, external, support, or, internationally, coordinated, efforts, the, us, epa, has, estimated, that, limiting, ground, level, ozone, concentration, to, 65, parts, per, billion, ppb, would, avert, 1, 700, to, 5, 100, premature, deaths, nationwide, in, 2020, compared, with, the, 75, ppb, standard, the, agency, projected, the, more, protective, standard, would, also, prevent, an, additional, 26, 000, cases, of, aggravated, asthma, and, more, than, a, million, cases, of, missed, work, or, school, following, this, assessment, the, epa, acted, to, protect, public, health, by, lowering, the, national, ambient, air, quality, standards, naaqs, for, ground, level, ozone, to, 70, ppb, a, 2008, economic, study, of, the, health, impacts, and, associated, costs, of, air, pollution, in, the, los, angeles, basin, and, san, joaquin, valley, of, southern, california, shows, that, more, than, 3, 800, people, die, prematurely, approximately, 14, years, earlier, than, normal, each, year, because, air, pollution, levels, violate, federal, standards, the, number, of, annual, premature, deaths, is, considerably, higher, than, the, fatalities, related, to, auto, collisions, in, the, same, area, which, average, fewer, than, 2, 000, per, year, a, 2021, study, found, that, outdoor, air, pollution, is, associated, with, substantially, increased, mortality, even, at, low, pollution, levels, below, the, current, european, and, north, american, standards, and, who, guideline, values, shortly, before, the, who, adjusted, its, guidelines, according, to, the, global, burden, of, disease, study, air, pollution, is, responsible, for, 19, of, all, cardiovascular, deaths, there, is, strong, evidence, linking, both, short, and, long, term, exposure, to, air, pollution, with, cardiovascular, disease, mortality, and, morbidity, stroke, blood, pressure, and, ischemic, heart, diseases, ihd, air, pollution, is, a, leading, risk, factor, for, stroke, particularly, in, developing, countries, where, pollutant, levels, are, highest, a, systematic, analysis, of, 17, different, risk, factors, in, 188, countries, found, air, pollution, is, associated, with, nearly, one, in, three, strokes, 29, worldwide, 33, 7, of, strokes, in, developing, countries, versus, 10, 2, in, developed, countries, in, women, air, pollution, is, not, associated, with, hemorrhagic, but, with, ischemic, stroke, air, pollution, was, found, to, be, associated, with, increased, incidence, and, mortality, from, coronary, stroke, associations, are, believed, to, be, causal, and, effects, may, be, mediated, by, vasoconstriction, low, grade, inflammation, and, atherosclerosis, other, mechanisms, such, as, autonomic, nervous, system, imbalance, have, also, been, suggested, research, has, demonstrated, increased, risk, of, developing, asthma, and, chronic, obstructive, pulmonary, disease, copd, from, increased, exposure, to, traffic, related, air, pollution, air, pollution, has, been, associated, with, increased, hospitalization, and, mortality, from, asthma, and, copd, copd, comprises, a, spectrum, of, clinical, disorders, that, include, emphysema, bronchiectasis, and, chronic, bronchitis, copd, risk, factors, are, both, genetic, and, environmental, elevated, particle, pollution, contributes, to, the, exacerbation, of, this, disease, and, likely, its, pathogenesis, the, risk, of, lung, disease, from, air, pollution, is, greatest, for, infants, and, young, children, whose, normal, breathing, is, faster, than, that, of, older, children, and, adults, the, elderly, those, who, work, outside, or, spend, a, lot, of, time, outside, and, those, who, have, heart, or, lung, disease, comorbidities, a, study, conducted, in, 1960, 1961, in, the, wake, of, the, great, smog, of, 1952, compared, 293, london, residents, with, 477, residents, of, gloucester, peterborough, and, norwich, three, towns, with, low, reported, death, rates, from, chronic, bronchitis, all, subjects, were, male, postal, truck, drivers, aged, 40, to, 59, compared, to, the, subjects, from, the, outlying, towns, the, london, subjects, exhibited, more, severe, respiratory, symptoms, including, cough, phlegm, and, dyspnea, reduced, lung, function, fev, 1, and, peak, flow, rate, and, increased, sputum, production, and, purulence, the, differences, were, more, pronounced, for, subjects, aged, 50, to, 59, the, study, controlled, for, age, and, smoking, habits, so, concluded, that, air, pollution, was, the, most, likely, cause, of, the, observed, differences, more, studies, have, shown, that, air, pollution, exposure, from, traffic, reduces, lung, function, development, in, children, and, lung, function, may, be, compromised, by, air, pollution, even, at, low, concentrations, it, is, believed, that, much, like, cystic, fibrosis, serious, health, hazards, become, more, apparent, when, living, in, a, more, urban, environment, studies, have, shown, that, in, urban, areas, people, experience, mucus, hypersecretion, lower, levels, of, lung, function, and, more, self, diagnosis, of, chronic, bronchitis, and, emphysema, around, 300, 000, lung, cancer, deaths, were, attributed, globally, in, 2019, to, exposure, to, fine, particulate, matter, pm, 2, 5, suspended, in, the, air, pm, 2, 5, exposure, such, as, from, car, exhausts, activates, dormant, mutations, in, lung, cells, causing, them, to, become, cancerous, long, term, exposure, to, pm, 2, 5, fine, particulates, increases, the, overall, risk, of, non, accidental, mortality, by, 6, per, 10, g, m, 3, increase, exposure, to, pm, 2, 5, is, also, associated, with, an, increased, risk, of, mortality, from, lung, cancer, range, 15, 21, per, 10, g, m, 3, increase, and, total, cardiovascular, mortality, range, 12, 14, per, 10, g, m, 3, increase, the, review, further, noted, that, living, close, to, busy, traffic, appears, to, be, associated, with, elevated, risks, of, these, three, outcomes, increase, in, lung, cancer, deaths, cardiovascular, deaths, and, overall, non, accidental, deaths, the, reviewers, also, found, suggestive, evidence, that, exposure, to, pm, 2, 5, is, positively, associated, with, mortality, from, coronary, heart, diseases, and, exposure, to, so, 2, increases, mortality, from, lung, cancer, but, the, data, was, insufficient, to, provide, solid, conclusions, another, investigation, showed, that, higher, activity, level, increases, deposition, fraction, of, aerosol, particles, in, human, lung, and, recommended, avoiding, heavy, activities, like, running, in, outdoor, space, at, polluted, areas, in, 2011, a, large, danish, epidemiological, study, found, an, increased, risk, of, lung, cancer, for, people, who, lived, in, areas, with, high, nitrogen, oxide, concentrations, another, danish, study, likewise, noted, evidence, of, possible, associations, between, air, pollution, and, other, forms, of, cancer, including, cervical, cancer, and, brain, cancer, a, study, of, 163, 197, taiwanese, residents, over, the, period, of, 2001, 2016, estimated, that, every, 5, g, m, 3, decrease, from, an, approximate, peak, of, 30, g, m, 3, in, the, ambient, concentration, of, pm, 2, 5, was, associated, with, a, 25, reduced, risk, of, chronic, kidney, disease, development, according, to, a, cohort, study, involving, 10, 997, atherosclerosis, patients, higher, pm, 2, 5, exposure, is, associated, with, increased, albuminuria, an, increase, in, no, 2, is, significantly, associated, with, a, lower, live, birth, rate, in, women, undergoing, ivf, treatment, in, the, general, population, there, is, a, significant, increase, in, miscarriage, rate, in, women, exposed, to, no, 2, compared, to, those, not, exposed, co, exposure, is, significantly, associated, with, stillbirth, in, the, second, and, third, trimester, polycyclic, aromatic, hydrocarbons, pahs, have, been, associated, with, reduced, fertility, benzo, a, pyrene, bap, is, a, well, known, pah, and, carcinogen, which, is, often, found, in, exhaust, fumes, and, cigarette, smoke, pahs, have, been, reported, to, administer, their, toxic, effects, through, oxidative, stress, by, increasing, the, production, of, reactive, oxygen, species, ros, which, can, result, in, inflammation, and, cell, death, more, long, term, exposure, to, pahs, can, result, in, dna, damage, and, reduced, repair, exposure, to, bap, has, been, reported, to, reduce, sperm, motility, and, increasing, the, exposure, worsens, this, effect, research, has, demonstrated, that, more, baps, were, found, in, men, with, reported, fertility, issues, compared, to, men, without, studies, have, shown, that, baps, can, affect, folliculogenesis, and, ovarian, development, by, reducing, the, number, of, ovarian, germ, cells, via, triggering, cell, death, pathways, and, inducing, inflammation, which, can, lead, to, ovarian, damage, particulate, matter, pm, refers, to, the, collection, of, solids, and, liquids, suspended, in, the, air, these, can, be, harmful, to, humans, and, more, research, has, shown, that, these, effects, may, be, more, extensive, than, first, thought, particularly, on, male, fertility, pm, can, be, different, sizes, such, as, pm, 2, 5, which, are, tiny, particles, of, 2, 5, microns, in, width, or, smaller, compared, with, pm, 10, which, are, classified, as, 10, microns, in, diameter, or, less, a, study, in, california, found, that, increased, exposure, to, pm, 2, 5, led, to, decreased, sperm, motility, and, increased, abnormal, morphology, similarly, in, poland, exposure, to, pm, 2, 5, and, pm, 10, led, to, an, increase, in, the, percentage, of, cells, with, immature, chromatin, dna, that, has, not, fully, developed, or, has, developed, abnormally, in, turkey, a, study, examined, the, fertility, of, men, who, work, as, toll, collectors, and, are, therefore, exposed, to, high, levels, of, traffic, pollutants, daily, traffic, pollution, often, has, high, levels, of, pm, 10, alongside, carbon, monoxide, and, nitrogen, oxides, there, were, significant, differences, in, sperm, count, and, motility, in, this, study, group, compared, to, a, control, group, with, limited, air, pollution, exposure, in, women, while, overall, effects, on, fertility, do, not, appear, significant, there, is, an, association, between, increased, exposure, to, pm, 10, and, early, miscarriage, exposure, to, smaller, particulate, matter, pm, 2, 5, appears, to, have, an, effect, on, conception, rates, in, women, undergoing, ivf, but, does, not, affect, live, birth, rates, ground, level, ozone, o, 3, when, in, high, concentrations, is, regarded, as, an, air, pollutant, and, is, often, found, in, smog, in, industrial, areas, there, is, limited, research, about, the, effect, that, ozone, pollution, has, on, fertility, at, present, there, is, no, evidence, to, suggest, that, ozone, exposure, poses, a, deleterious, effect, on, spontaneous, fertility, in, either, females, or, males, however, there, have, been, studies, which, suggest, that, high, levels, of, ozone, pollution, often, a, problem, in, the, summer, months, exert, an, effect, on, in, vitro, fertilisation, ivf, outcomes, within, an, ivf, population, no, x, and, ozone, pollutants, were, linked, with, reduced, rates, of, live, birth, while, most, research, on, this, topic, is, focused, on, the, direct, human, exposure, of, air, pollution, other, studies, have, analysed, the, impact, of, air, pollution, on, gametes, and, embryos, within, ivf, laboratories, multiple, studies, have, reported, a, marked, improvement, in, embryo, quality, implantation, and, pregnancy, rates, after, ivf, laboratories, have, implemented, air, filters, in, a, concerted, effort, to, reduce, levels, of, air, pollution, therefore, ozone, pollution, is, considered, to, have, a, negative, impact, on, the, success, of, assisted, reproductive, technologies, art, when, occurring, at, high, levels, ozone, is, thought, to, act, in, a, biphasic, manner, where, a, positive, effect, on, live, birth, is, observed, when, ozone, exposure, is, limited, to, before, ivf, embryo, implantation, conversely, a, negative, effect, is, demonstrated, upon, exposure, to, ozone, after, embryo, implantation, however, after, adjusting, for, no2, the, association, between, o3, and, ivf, live, birth, rate, was, no, longer, significant, in, terms, of, male, fertility, ozone, is, reported, to, cause, a, significant, decrease, in, the, concentration, and, count, of, sperm, in, semen, after, exposure, similarly, sperm, vitality, the, proportion, of, live, spermatozoa, in, a, sample, was, demonstrated, to, be, diminished, as, a, result, of, exposure, to, air, pollution, however, findings, on, the, effect, of, ozone, exposure, on, male, fertility, are, somewhat, discordant, highlighting, the, need, for, further, research, children, and, infants, are, among, the, most, vulnerable, to, air, pollution, polluted, air, leads, to, the, poisoning, of, millions, of, children, under, the, age, of, 15, resulting, in, the, death, of, some, 600, 000, children, annually, 543, 000, under, 5, years, of, age, and, 52, 000, aged, 5, 15, years, children, in, low, or, middle, income, countries, are, exposed, to, higher, levels, of, fine, particulate, matter, than, those, in, high, income, countries, health, effects, of, air, pollution, on, children, include, asthma, pneumonia, and, lower, respiratory, tract, infections, and, low, birth, weight, a, study, in, europe, found, that, exposure, to, ultrafine, particles, can, increase, blood, pressure, in, children, prenatal, exposure, to, polluted, air, has, been, linked, to, a, variety, of, neurodevelopmental, disorders, in, children, for, example, exposure, to, polycyclic, aromatic, hydrocarbons, pah, was, associated, with, reduced, iq, scores, and, symptoms, of, anxiety, and, depression, they, can, also, lead, to, detrimental, perinatal, health, outcomes, that, are, often, fatal, in, developing, countries, a, 2014, study, found, that, pahs, might, play, a, role, in, the, development, of, childhood, attention, deficit, hyperactivity, disorder, adhd, researchers, have, found, a, correlation, between, air, pollution, and, risk, of, autism, spectrum, disorder, asd, diagnosis, although, definitive, causality, has, not, yet, been, established, in, los, angeles, children, living, in, areas, with, high, levels, of, traffic, related, air, pollution, were, more, likely, to, be, diagnosed, with, autism, between, three, five, years, of, age, a, cohort, study, in, southern, california, linked, in, utero, exposure, to, near, roadway, air, pollution, to, an, increased, risk, of, asd, diagnosis, and, a, study, in, sweden, concluded, that, exposure, to, pm, 2, 5, during, pregnancy, was, associated, with, asd, a, danish, study, linked, exposure, to, air, pollution, during, infancy, but, not, during, pregnancy, to, an, increased, risk, of, asd, diagnosis, the, connection, between, air, pollution, and, neurodevelopmental, disorders, in, children, is, thought, to, be, related, to, epigenetic, dysregulation, of, the, primordial, germ, cells, embryo, and, fetus, during, a, critical, period, some, pahs, are, considered, endocrine, disruptors, and, are, lipid, soluble, when, they, build, up, in, adipose, tissue, they, can, be, transferred, across, the, placenta, can, exert, a, genotoxic, effect, cauding, dna, damange, and, mutations, air, pollution, has, been, associated, with, the, prevalence, of, preterm, births, ambient, levels, of, air, pollution, have, been, associated, with, preterm, birth, and, low, birth, weight, a, 2014, who, worldwide, survey, on, maternal, and, perinatal, health, found, a, statistically, significant, association, between, low, birth, weights, lbw, and, increased, levels, of, exposure, to, pm, 2, 5, women, in, regions, with, greater, than, average, pm, 2, 5, levels, had, statistically, significant, higher, odds, of, pregnancy, resulting, in, a, low, birth, weight, infant, even, when, adjusted, for, country, related, variables, the, effect, is, thought, to, be, from, stimulating, inflammation, and, increasing, oxidative, stress, a, study, found, that, in, 2010, exposure, to, pm, 2, 5, was, strongly, associated, with, 18, of, preterm, births, globally, which, was, approximately, 2, 7, million, premature, births, the, countries, with, the, highest, air, pollution, associated, preterm, births, were, in, south, and, east, asia, the, middle, east, north, africa, and, west, sub, saharan, africa, in, 2019, ambient, particulate, matter, pollution, in, africa, resulted, in, at, least, 383, 000, early, deaths, according, to, new, estimates, of, the, cost, of, air, pollution, in, the, continent, this, increased, from, 3, 6, in, 1990, to, around, 7, 4, of, all, premature, deaths, in, the, area, the, source, of, pm, 2, 5, differs, greatly, by, region, in, south, and, east, asia, pregnant, women, are, frequently, exposed, to, indoor, air, pollution, because, of, wood, and, other, biomass, fuels, being, used, for, cooking, which, are, responsible, for, more, than, 80, of, regional, pollution, in, the, middle, east, north, africa, and, west, sub, saharan, africa, fine, pm, comes, from, natural, sources, such, as, dust, storms, the, united, states, had, an, estimated, 50, 000, preterm, births, associated, with, exposure, to, pm, 2, 5, in, 2010, a, study, between, 1988, and, 1991, found, a, correlation, between, sulfur, dioxide, so, 2, and, total, suspended, particulates, tsp, and, preterm, births, and, low, birth, weights, in, beijing, a, group, of, 74, 671, pregnant, women, in, four, separate, regions, of, beijing, were, monitored, from, early, pregnancy, to, delivery, along, with, daily, air, pollution, levels, of, so, 2, and, tsp, along, with, other, particulates, the, estimated, reduction, in, birth, weight, was, 7, 3, g, for, every, 100, g, m, 3, increase, in, so, 2, and, 6, 9, g, for, each, 100, g, m, 3, increase, in, tsp, these, associations, were, statistically, significant, in, both, summer, and, winter, although, summer, was, greater, the, proportion, of, low, birth, weight, attributable, to, air, pollution, was, 13, this, is, the, largest, attributable, risk, ever, reported, for, the, known, risk, factors, of, low, birth, weight, coal, stoves, which, are, in, 97, of, homes, are, a, major, source, of, air, pollution, in, this, area, brauer, et, al, studied, the, relationship, between, air, pollution, and, proximity, to, a, highway, with, pregnancy, outcomes, in, a, vancouver, cohort, of, pregnant, women, using, addresses, to, estimate, exposure, during, pregnancy, exposure, to, no, no, 2, co, pm, 10, and, pm, 2, 5, were, associated, with, infants, born, small, for, gestational, age, sga, women, living, less, than, 50, meters, away, from, an, expressway, or, highway, were, 26, more, likely, to, give, birth, to, a, sga, infant, data, is, accumulating, that, air, pollution, exposure, also, affects, the, central, nervous, system, air, pollution, increases, the, risk, of, dementia, in, people, over, 50, years, old, indoor, air, pollution, exposure, during, childhood, may, negatively, affect, cognitive, function, and, neurodevelopment, prenatal, exposure, may, also, affect, neurodevelopment, studies, show, that, air, pollution, is, associated, with, a, variety, of, developmental, disabilities, oxidative, stress, and, neuro, inflammation, and, that, it, may, contribute, to, alzheimer, s, disease, and, parkinson, s, disease, researchers, found, that, early, exposure, to, air, pollution, causes, the, same, changes, in, the, brain, as, autism, and, schizophrenia, in, mice, it, also, showed, that, air, pollution, also, affected, short, term, memory, learning, ability, and, impulsivity, in, this, study, air, pollution, had, a, larger, negative, impact, on, male, mice, than, on, females, lead, researcher, on, the, study, deborah, cory, slechta, said, that, when, we, looked, closely, at, the, ventricles, we, could, see, that, the, white, matter, that, normally, surrounds, them, hadn, t, fully, developed, it, appears, that, inflammation, had, damaged, those, brain, cells, and, prevented, that, region, of, the, brain, from, developing, and, the, ventricles, simply, expanded, to, fill, the, space, our, findings, add, to, the, growing, body, of, evidence, that, air, pollution, may, play, a, role, in, autism, as, well, as, in, other, neurodevelopmental, disorders, exposure, to, fine, particulate, matter, can, increase, levels, of, cytokines, neurotransmitters, produced, in, response, to, infection, and, inflammation, that, are, also, associated, with, depression, and, suicide, pollution, has, been, associated, with, inflammation, of, the, brain, which, may, disrupt, mood, regulation, heightened, pm, 2, 5, levels, are, linked, to, more, self, reported, depressive, symptoms, and, increases, in, daily, suicide, rates, in, 2015, experimental, studies, reported, the, detection, of, significant, episodic, situational, cognitive, impairment, from, impurities, in, indoor, air, breathed, by, test, subjects, who, were, not, informed, about, changes, in, the, air, quality, significant, deficits, were, observed, in, the, performance, scores, achieved, in, increasing, concentrations, of, either, volatile, organic, compounds, vocs, or, carbon, dioxide, while, keeping, other, factors, constant, the, highest, impurity, levels, reached, are, not, uncommon, in, some, classroom, or, office, environments, higher, pm, 2, 5, and, co, 2, concentrations, were, shown, to, be, associated, with, slower, response, times, and, reduced, accuracy, in, tests, even, in, areas, with, relatively, low, levels, of, air, pollution, public, health, effects, can, be, significant, and, costly, since, a, large, number, of, people, breathe, in, such, pollutants, a, study, found, that, even, in, areas, of, the, u, s, where, ozone, and, pm, 2, 5, meet, federal, standards, medicare, recipients, who, are, exposed, to, more, air, pollution, have, higher, mortality, rates, rural, populations, in, india, like, those, in, urban, areas, are, also, exposed, to, high, levels, of, air, pollution, in, 2020, scientists, found, that, the, boundary, layer, air, over, the, southern, ocean, around, antarctica, is, unpolluted, by, humans, various, studies, have, estimated, the, impacts, of, air, pollution, on, agriculture, especially, ozone, a, 2020, study, showed, that, ozone, pollution, in, california, may, reduce, yields, of, certain, perennial, crops, such, as, table, grapes, by, as, much, as, 22, per, year, translating, into, economic, damages, of, more, than, 1, billion, per, year, after, air, pollutants, enter, the, agricultural, environment, they, not, only, directly, affect, agricultural, production, and, quality, but, also, enter, agricultural, waters, and, soil, the, covid, 19, induced, lockdown, served, as, a, natural, experiment, to, expose, the, close, links, between, air, quality, and, surface, greenness, in, india, the, lockdown, induced, improvement, in, air, quality, enhanced, surface, greenness, and, photosynthetic, activity, with, the, positive, response, of, vegetation, to, reduce, air, pollution, was, dominant, in, croplands, on, the, other, hand, agriculture, in, its, traditional, form, is, one, of, the, primary, contributors, to, the, emission, of, trace, gases, like, atmospheric, ammonia, air, pollution, costs, the, world, economy, 5, trillion, per, year, as, a, result, of, productivity, losses, and, degraded, quality, of, life, these, productivity, losses, are, caused, by, deaths, due, to, diseases, caused, by, air, pollution, one, out, of, ten, deaths, in, 2013, was, caused, by, diseases, associated, with, air, pollution, and, the, problem, is, getting, worse, a, small, improvement, in, air, quality, 1, reduction, of, ambient, pm, 2, 5, and, ozone, concentrations, would, produce, 29, million, in, annual, savings, in, the, lower, fraser, valley, region, in, 2010, this, finding, is, based, on, health, valuation, of, lethal, death, and, sub, lethal, illness, affects, the, problem, is, even, more, acute, in, the, developing, world, children, under, age, 5, in, lower, income, countries, are, more, than, 60, times, as, likely, to, die, from, exposure, to, air, pollution, as, children, in, high, income, countries, the, report, states, that, additional, economic, losses, caused, by, air, pollution, including, health, costs, and, the, adverse, effect, on, agricultural, and, other, productivity, were, not, calculated, in, the, report, and, thus, the, actual, costs, to, the, world, economy, are, far, higher, than, 5, trillion, a, study, published, in, 2022, found, a, strong, and, significant, connection, between, air, pollution, and, construction, site, accidents, and, that, a, 10, ppb, increase, in, no, 2, levels, increases, the, likelihood, of, an, accident, by, as, much, as, 25, artificial, air, pollution, may, be, detectable, on, earth, from, distant, vantage, points, such, as, other, planetary, systems, via, atmospheric, seti, including, no, 2, pollution, levels, and, with, telescopic, technology, close, to, today, it, may, also, be, possible, to, detect, extraterrestrial, civilizations, this, way, the, world, s, worst, short, term, civilian, pollution, crisis, was, the, 1984, bhopal, disaster, in, india, leaked, industrial, vapours, from, the, union, carbide, factory, belonging, to, union, carbide, inc, u, s, a, later, bought, by, dow, chemical, company, killed, at, least, 3787, people, and, injured, from, 150, 000, to, 600, 000, the, united, kingdom, suffered, its, worst, air, pollution, event, when, the, 4, december, great, smog, of, 1952, formed, over, london, in, six, days, more, than, 4, 000, died, and, more, recent, estimates, put, the, figure, at, nearer, 12, 000, an, accidental, leak, of, anthrax, spores, from, a, biological, warfare, laboratory, in, the, former, ussr, in, 1979, near, yekaterinburg, formerly, sverdlovsk, is, believed, to, have, caused, at, least, 64, deaths, the, worst, single, incident, of, air, pollution, to, occur, in, the, us, occurred, in, donora, pennsylvania, in, late, october, 1948, when, 20, people, died, and, over, 7, 000, were, injured, global, depletion, of, the, surrounding, air, pollution, will, require, valiant, leadership, a, surplus, of, combined, resources, from, the, international, community, and, extensive, societal, changes, pollution, prevention, seeks, to, prevent, pollution, such, as, air, pollution, and, could, include, adjustments, to, industrial, and, business, activities, such, as, designing, sustainable, manufacturing, processes, and, the, products, designs, and, related, legal, regulations, as, well, as, efforts, towards, renewable, energy, transitions, efforts, to, reduce, particulate, matter, in, the, air, may, result, in, better, health, the, 9, euro, ticket, scheme, in, germany, which, allowed, people, to, buy, a, monthly, pass, allowing, use, on, all, local, and, regional, transport, trains, trams, and, busses, for, 9, euro, for, one, month, of, unlimited, travel, saved, 1, 8, million, tons, of, co, 2, emissions, during, its, three, month, implementation, from, june, to, august, 2022, various, pollution, control, technologies, and, strategies, are, available, to, reduce, air, pollution, at, its, most, basic, level, land, use, planning, is, likely, to, involve, zoning, and, transport, infrastructure, planning, in, most, developed, countries, land, use, planning, is, an, important, part, of, social, policy, ensuring, that, land, is, used, efficiently, for, the, benefit, of, the, wider, economy, and, population, as, well, as, to, protect, the, environment, stringent, environmental, regulations, effective,

has, been, researched, for, its, ability, to, reduce, air, pollution, ultraviolet, light, will, release, free, electrons, from, material, thereby, creating, free, radicals, which, break, up, vocs, and, no, x, gases, one, form, is, superhydrophilic, pollution, eating, nanoparticles, placed, near, a, busy, road, were, shown, to, absorb, toxic, emission, from, around, 20, cars, each, day, since, a, large, share, of, air, pollution, is, caused, by, combustion, of, fossil, fuels, such, as, coal, and, oil, the, reduction, of, these, fuels, can, reduce, air, pollution, drastically, most, effective, is, the, switch, to, clean, power, sources, such, as, wind, power, solar, power, hydro, power, which, do, not, cause, air, pollution, efforts, to, reduce, pollution, from, mobile, sources, includes, expanding, regulation, to, new, sources, such, as, cruise, and, transport, ships, farm, equipment, and, small, gas, powered, equipment, such, as, string, trimmers, chainsaws, and, snowmobiles, increased, fuel, efficiency, such, as, through, the, use, of, hybrid, vehicles, conversion, to, cleaner, fuels, and, conversion, to, electric, vehicles, for, example, buses, in, new, delhi, india, have, run, on, compressed, natural, gas, since, 2000, to, help, eliminate, the, city, s, pea, soup, smog, a, very, effective, means, to, reduce, air, pollution, is, the, transition, to, renewable, energy, according, to, a, study, published, in, energy, and, environmental, science, in, 2015, the, switch, to, 100, renewable, energy, in, the, united, states, would, eliminate, about, 62, 000, premature, mortalities, per, year, and, about, 42, 000, in, 2050, if, no, biomass, were, used, this, would, save, about, 600, billion, in, health, costs, a, year, due, to, reduced, air, pollution, in, 2050, or, about, 3, 6, of, the, 2014, u, s, gross, domestic, product, air, quality, improvement, is, a, near, term, benefit, among, the, many, societal, benefits, from, climate, change, mitigation, there, are, now, practical, alternatives, to, the, principal, causes, of, air, pollution, the, following, items, are, commonly, used, as, pollution, control, devices, in, industry, and, transportation, they, can, either, destroy, contaminants, or, remove, them, from, an, exhaust, stream, before, it, is, emitted, into, the, atmosphere, spatiotemporal, monitoring, of, air, quality, may, be, necessary, for, improving, air, quality, and, thereby, the, health, and, safety, of, the, public, and, assessing, impacts, of, interventions, such, monitoring, is, done, to, different, extents, with, different, regulatory, requirements, with, discrepant, regional, coverage, by, a, variety, of, organizations, and, governance, entities, such, as, using, a, variety, of, technologies, for, use, of, the, data, and, sensing, such, mobile, iot, sensors, satellites, and, monitoring, stations, some, websites, attempt, to, map, air, pollution, levels, using, available, data, numerical, models, either, on, a, global, scale, using, tools, such, as, gcms, general, circulation, models, coupled, with, a, pollution, module, or, ctms, chemical, transport, model, can, be, used, to, simulate, the, levels, of, different, pollutants, in, the, atmosphere, these, tools, can, have, several, types, atmospheric, model, and, different, uses, these, models, can, be, used, in, forecast, mode, which, can, help, policy, makers, to, decide, on, appropriate, actions, when, an, air, pollution, episode, is, detected, they, can, also, be, used, for, climate, modeling, including, evolution, of, air, quality, in, the, future, for, example, the, ipcc, intergovernmental, panel, on, climate, change, provides, climate, simulations, including, air, quality, assessments, in, their, reports, latest, report, accessible, through, their, site, in, general, there, are, two, types, of, air, quality, standards, the, first, class, of, standards, such, as, the, u, s, national, ambient, air, quality, standards, and, e, u, air, quality, directive, set, maximum, atmospheric, concentrations, for, specific, pollutants, environmental, agencies, enact, regulations, which, are, intended, to, result, in, attainment, of, these, target, levels, the, second, class, such, as, the, north, american, air, quality, index, take, the, form, of, a, scale, with, various, thresholds, which, is, used, to, communicate, to, the, public, the, relative, risk, of, outdoor, activity, the, scale, may, or, may, not, distinguish, between, different, pollutants, in, canada, air, pollution, and, associated, health, risks, are, measured, with, the, air, quality, health, index, aqhi, it, is, a, health, protection, tool, used, to, make, decisions, to, reduce, short, term, exposure, to, air, pollution, by, adjusting, activity, levels, during, increased, levels, of, air, pollution, the, aqhi, is, a, federal, program, jointly, coordinated, by, health, canada, and, environment, canada, however, the, aqhi, program, would, not, be, possible, without, the, commitment, and, support, of, the, provinces, municipalities, and, ngos, from, air, quality, monitoring, to, health, risk, communication, and, community, engagement, local, partners, are, responsible, for, the, vast, majority, of, work, related, to, aqhi, implementation, the, aqhi, provides, a, number, from, 1, to, 10, to, indicate, the, level, of, health, risk, associated, with, local, air, quality, occasionally, when, the, amount, of, air, pollution, is, abnormally, high, the, number, may, exceed, 10, the, aqhi, provides, a, local, air, quality, current, value, as, well, as, a, local, air, quality, maximums, forecast, for, today, tonight, and, tomorrow, and, provides, associated, health, advice, as, it, is, now, known, that, even, low, levels, of, air, pollution, can, trigger, discomfort, for, the, sensitive, population, the, index, has, been, developed, as, a, continuum, the, higher, the, number, the, greater, the, health, risk, and, need, to, take, precautions, the, index, describes, the, level, of, health, risk, associated, with, this, number, as, low, moderate, high, or, very, high, and, suggests, steps, that, can, be, taken, to, reduce, exposure, the, measurement, is, based, on, the, observed, relationship, of, nitrogen, dioxide, no, 2, ground, level, ozone, o, 3, and, particulates, pm, 2, 5, with, mortality, from, an, analysis, of, several, canadian, cities, significantly, all, three, of, these, pollutants, can, pose, health, risks, even, at, low, levels, of, exposure, especially, among, those, with, pre, existing, health, problems, when, developing, the, aqhi, health, canada, s, original, analysis, of, health, effects, included, five, major, air, pollutants, particulates, ozone, and, nitrogen, dioxide, no, 2, as, well, as, sulfur, dioxide, so, 2, and, carbon, monoxide, co, the, latter, two, pollutants, provided, little, information, in, predicting, health, effects, and, were, removed, from, the, aqhi, formulation, the, aqhi, does, not, measure, the, effects, of, odour, pollen, dust, heat, or, humidity, ta, luft, is, the, german, air, quality, regulation, in, europe, council, directive, 96, 62, ec, on, ambient, air, quality, assessment, and, management, provides, a, common, strategy, against, which, member, states, can, set, objectives, for, ambient, air, quality, in, order, to, avoid, prevent, or, reduce, harmful, effects, on, human, health, and, the, environment, and, improve, air, quality, where, it, is, unsatisfactory, in, july, 2008, in, the, case, dieter, janecek, v, freistaat, bayern, the, european, court, of, justice, ruled, that, under, this, directive, citizens, have, the, right, to, require, national, authorities, to, implement, a, short, term, action, plan, that, aims, to, maintain, or, achieve, compliance, to, air, quality, limit, values, this, important, case, law, appears, to, confirm, the, role, of, the, ec, as, centralised, regulator, to, european, nation, states, as, regards, air, pollution, control, it, places, a, supranational, legal, obligation, on, the, uk, to, protect, its, citizens, from, dangerous, levels, of, air, pollution, furthermore, superseding, national, interests, with, those, of, the, citizen, in, 2010, the, european, commission, ec, threatened, the, uk, with, legal, action, against, the, successive, breaching, of, pm, 10, limit, values, the, uk, government, has, identified, that, if, fines, are, imposed, they, could, cost, the, nation, upwards, of, 300, million, per, year, in, march, 2011, the, greater, london, built, up, area, remained, the, only, uk, region, in, breach, of, the, ec, s, limit, values, and, was, given, three, months, to, implement, an, emergency, action, plan, aimed, at, meeting, the, eu, air, quality, directive, the, city, of, london, has, dangerous, levels, of, pm, 10, concentrations, estimated, to, cause, 3000, deaths, per, year, within, the, city, as, well, as, the, threat, of, eu, fines, in, 2010, it, was, threatened, with, legal, action, for, scrapping, the, western, congestion, charge, zone, which, is, claimed, to, have, led, to, an, increase, in, air, pollution, levels, in, response, to, these, charges, mayor, of, london, boris, johnson, has, criticised, the, current, need, for, european, cities, to, communicate, with, europe, through, their, nation, state, s, central, government, arguing, that, in, future, a, great, city, like, london, should, be, permitted, to, bypass, its, government, and, deal, directly, with, the, european, commission, regarding, its, air, quality, action, plan, this, can, be, interpreted, as, recognition, that, cities, can, transcend, the, traditional, national, government, organisational, hierarchy, and, develop, solutions, to, air, pollution, using, global, governance, networks, for, example, through, transnational, relations, transnational, relations, include, but, are, not, exclusive, to, national, governments, and, intergovernmental, organisations, allowing, sub, national, actors, including, cities, and, regions, to, partake, in, air, pollution, control, as, independent, actors, global, city, partnerships, can, be, built, into, networks, for, example, the, c40, cities, climate, leadership, group, of, which, london, is, a, member, the, c40, is, a, public, non, state, network, of, the, world, s, leading, cities, that, aims, to, curb, their, greenhouse, emissions, the, c40, has, been, identified, as, governance, from, the, middle, and, is, an, alternative, to, intergovernmental, policy, it, has, the, potential, to, improve, urban, air, quality, as, participating, cities, exchange, information, learn, from, best, practices, and, consequently, mitigate, carbon, dioxide, emissions, independently, from, national, government, decisions, a, criticism, of, the, c40, network, is, that, its, exclusive, nature, limits, influence, to, participating, cities, and, risks, drawing, resources, away, from, less, powerful, city, and, regional, actors, because, indigenous, people, frequently, experience, a, disproportionate, share, of, the, effects, of, environmental, degradation, and, climate, change, even, while, they, have, made, very, little, contribution, to, the, processes, causing, these, changes, environmental, justice, is, especially, important, to, them, indigenous, peoples, have, been, marginalized, and, their, lands, and, resources, have, been, exploited, as, a, result, of, historical, and, continuing, colonization, institutional, injustices, and, inequality, indigenous, groups, frequently, lack, the, political, and, financial, clout, to, influence, policy, decisions, that, impact, their, lands, and, means, of, subsistence, or, to, lessen, the, effects, of, climate, change, this, makes, the, already, existing, inequalities, in, these, communities, social, economic, and, health, conditions, worse, furthermore, traditional, ecological, knowledge, and, indigenous, knowledge, systems, provide, insightful, information, about, sustainable, resource, management, and, climate, change, adaptation, techniques, to, promote, persistence, and, environmental, justice, indigenous, viewpoints, must, be, acknowledged, and, integrated, into, efforts, to, mitigate, the, effects, of, climate, change, and, adapt, to, them, combating, climate, change, necessitates, an, all, encompassing, strategy, that, recognizes, the, interdependence, of, social, economic, and, environmental, elements, this, entails, defending, treaty, rights, advancing, indigenous, sovereignty, and, self, determination, and, aiding, indigenous, led, projects, for, sustainable, development, and, environmental, preservation, air, pollution, hotspots, are, areas, where, air, pollution, emissions, expose, individuals, to, increased, negative, health, effects, they, are, particularly, common, in, highly, populated, urban, areas, where, there, may, be, a, combination, of, stationary, sources, e, g, industrial, facilities, and, mobile, sources, e, g, cars, and, trucks, of, pollution, emissions, from, these, sources, can, cause, respiratory, disease, childhood, asthma, cancer, and, other, health, problems, fine, particulate, matter, such, as, diesel, soot, which, contributes, to, more, than, 3, 2, million, premature, deaths, around, the, world, each, year, is, a, significant, problem, it, is, very, small, and, can, lodge, itself, within, the, lungs, and, enter, the, bloodstream, diesel, soot, is, concentrated, in, densely, populated, areas, and, one, in, six, people, in, the, u, s, live, near, a, diesel, pollution, hot, spot, while, air, pollution, hotspots, affect, a, variety, of, populations, some, groups, are, more, likely, to, be, located, in, hotspots, previous, studies, have, shown, disparities, in, exposure, to, pollution, by, race, and, or, income, hazardous, land, uses, toxic, storage, and, disposal, facilities, manufacturing, facilities, major, roadways, tend, to, be, located, where, property, values, and, income, levels, are, low, low, socioeconomic, status, can, be, a, proxy, for, other, kinds, of, social, vulnerability, including, race, a, lack, of, ability, to, influence, regulation, and, a, lack, of, ability, to, move, to, neighborhoods, with, less, environmental, pollution, these, communities, bear, a, disproportionate, burden, of, environmental, pollution, and, are, more, likely, to, face, health, risks, such, as, cancer, or, asthma, studies, show, that, patterns, in, race, and, income, disparities, not, only, indicate, a, higher, exposure, to, pollution, but, also, higher, risk, of, adverse, health, outcomes, communities, characterized, by, low, socioeconomic, status, and, racial, minorities, can, be, more, vulnerable, to, cumulative, adverse, health, impacts, resulting, from, elevated, exposure, to, pollutants, than, more, privileged, communities, blacks, and, latinos, generally, face, more, pollution, than, whites, and, asians, and, low, income, communities, bear, a, higher, burden, of, risk, than, affluent, ones, racial, discrepancies, are, particularly, distinct, in, suburban, areas, of, the, southern, united, states, and, metropolitan, areas, of, the, midwestern, and, western, united, states, residents, in, public, housing, who, are, generally, low, income, and, cannot, move, to, healthier, neighborhoods, are, highly, affected, by, nearby, refineries, and, chemical, plants, air, pollution, is, usually, concentrated, in, densely, populated, metropolitan, areas, especially, in, developing, countries, where, cities, are, experiencing, rapid, growth, and, environmental, regulations, are, relatively, lax, or, nonexistent, urbanization, leads, to, a, rapid, rise, in, premature, mortality, due, to, anthropogenic, air, pollution, in, fast, growing, tropical, cities, however, even, populated, areas, in, developed, countries, attain, unhealthy, levels, of, pollution, with, los, angeles, and, rome, being, two, examples, between, 2002, and, 2011, the, incidence, of, lung, cancer, in, beijing, near, doubled, while, smoking, remains, the, leading, cause, of, lung, cancer, in, china, the, number, of, smokers, is, falling, while, lung, cancer, rates, are, rising, tehran, was, declared, the, most, polluted, city, in, the, world, on, may, 24, 2022, in, a, 2019, projection, by, 2030, half, of, the, world, s, pollution, emissions, could, be, generated, by, africa, potential, contributors, to, such, an, outcome, include, increased, burning, activities, such, as, the, burning, of, open, waste, traffic, agri, food, and, chemical, industries, sand, dust, from, the, sahara, and, overall, population, growth, in, a, 2012, study, by, 2050, outdoor, air, pollution, particulate, matter, and, ground, level, ozone, is, projected, to, become, the, top, cause, of, environmentally, related, deaths, worldwide, source,
